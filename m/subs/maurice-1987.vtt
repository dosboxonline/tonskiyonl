WEBVTT

01:21.207 --> 01:22.124
- Thank you.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.216
- Hall, come here please.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.097
- Sir?

01:36.347 --> 01:37.098
- Come on.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.101
Have a good send off?

01:40.351 --> 01:41.769
- Yes sir, thank you sir.

01:42.019 --> 01:46.273
Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture,
the light of the world.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.567
The fellas have given
me a set of Guatemalas.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.277
Up to two dollars!

01:50.528 --> 01:53.197
The ones with the parrot
and the pillar on.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.281
Look, sir.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.327
- Oh, splendid, splendid.

01:59.537 --> 02:02.998
And um, what did Mr. Abrahams
say to you?

02:03.249 --> 02:05.668
Told you you were a
miserable sinner, I hope.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.920
- Mr. Abrahams said
I'm never to do anything

02:09.170 --> 02:12.299
I'd be ashamed to do in front of my mother.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.594
He said my next school will
be more like the world.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.179
- Did he, did he?

02:18.681 --> 02:21.934
What's the world like, do you suppose?

02:22.184 --> 02:24.979
- Don't know, sir, I'm a boy.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.731
- Do you, um, have any
older brothers, Hall?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.692
- No, sir, only Kitty and Ada.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.235
They're my sisters, sir.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.069
- No uncles?

02:32.319 --> 02:33.112
- No, sir.

02:33.988 --> 02:34.947
There's Dr. Barry.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.658
He knew my father
before he died.

02:37.908 --> 02:42.037
- So you don't really know a
great many grown-up fellows.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.873
- No, not really, sir.

02:44.123 --> 02:47.376
Mother keeps a coachman,
and George for the garden.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.420
But of course, you mean gentlemen.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.882
- Hall, I'm going to talk
to you for a few moments

02:53.132 --> 02:55.092
as if I were your father.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.761
It isn't anything
your mother could say.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.555
Do you, do you see?

03:01.307 --> 03:04.018
Your body, is about to experience

03:05.936 --> 03:09.273
various changes, physical changes.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.567
Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained

03:11.817 --> 03:12.860
to you that in the beginning,

03:13.110 --> 03:15.154
"God created he man and woman,

03:15.404 --> 03:17.698
"that the earth should
be peopled abundantly."

03:17.948 --> 03:19.366
- Yes sir, Sir...

03:21.535 --> 03:22.620
what changes?

03:27.791 --> 03:31.545
- I speak, Hall, of the
sacred mystery of sex,

03:33.464 --> 03:37.051
the act of procreation
between a man and his wife.

03:37.301 --> 03:41.096
The procreation indeed
of all creeping things.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.478
You will discover that
your membrum virilis,

03:50.147 --> 03:51.398
that's Latin from vir.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.609
- Vir, sir, it means man, sir.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.236
- Very good, very good.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.528
Um, uh, look.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.157
Uh, this might be easier if I...

04:03.494 --> 04:06.247
That, that, that, um, that thing.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.541
There, now, that will...

04:13.337 --> 04:15.422
develop and grow larger.

04:15.673 --> 04:16.464
You see?

04:17.548 --> 04:20.219
And when that happens, the man lies

04:20.469 --> 04:23.555
very, very close to his wife,

04:23.806 --> 04:27.935
and he puts his membrum
virilis into her vagina...

04:31.814 --> 04:33.190
thus.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.694
Then, in due course, she
will bring forth his child.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.280
Seminiferous tubules,

04:39.530 --> 04:41.991
labia major and minor, ducts...

04:45.202 --> 04:46.078
vulva.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.460
That, that is the very
crown of life, Hall.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.298
God's wondrous purpose.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.260
Your body is his temple.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.888
You must never, ever
pollute that temple.

05:06.098 --> 05:09.310
And when,
as one day I'm sure you will,

05:09.560 --> 05:12.896
you fall in love and
marry, you will discover

05:13.147 --> 05:15.482
to serve and protect a woman,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.652
and have children by her,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.114
is life's chiefest glory.

05:23.073 --> 05:23.949
- Yes, sir.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.201
- You must never,

05:26.452 --> 05:28.829
ever mention any of this
to your mother,

05:29.079 --> 05:30.914
or, or, or indeed to any lady.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.334
And if at your next school
the fellows mention it,

05:33.584 --> 05:35.252
just shut them up.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.212
Tell them you know.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.381
- I think I shan't marry.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.134
- What?

05:42.384 --> 05:45.512
Look, um, in 10 years to the day,

05:45.763 --> 05:48.098
I invite you and your wife to dine

05:48.349 --> 05:49.892
with me and my wife as our guests.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.018
What do you say?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.061
- Oh, sir.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.562
- Yes, it's
a bargain then, is it?

05:58.067 --> 06:00.694
Oh, God, those infernal designs.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.116
- Sir, won't they be all right?

06:06.367 --> 06:09.620
The tide will have
covered them by now.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.708
- Oh, yes, the rising tide.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.004
I only hope to God he's right, by God.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.515
- Come, Victoria, come.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.518
- Wagner's utter rubbish.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.186
Fat women with horns on their heads,

06:34.436 --> 06:35.229
singing at the tops of their voices

06:35.479 --> 06:36.855
about how happy they are to be dying.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.316
It's a horrible noise,
and it's unhealthy.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.902
- But music is
about death, it always has been.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.445
- I think
he's trying to provoke us.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.114
Go on then, Risley, enlighten us.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.325
- A superior mind wouldn't
need enlightening.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.869
Music is the highest of the arts.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.707
It needs no reference to the
figurative, or the corporeal.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.709
It is therefore, of all the arts,

06:57.960 --> 07:00.003
the closest to death.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.798
Wagner's by no means unhealthy.

07:03.048 --> 07:03.882
He's merely expressing

07:04.133 --> 07:05.634
most exactly the state of things.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.553
- Help
yourselves to potatoes, Hall.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.096
Don't stand on ceremony.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.223
- I can't stand music.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.016
Or concert halls.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.977
I don't go in for being superior.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.103
- Don't you?

07:16.353 --> 07:16.937
I do.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.982
- Come along, Chapman,
you're in need of food.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.151
- I expect Lord Risley isn't.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.154
I've put him off with my low talk.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.117
- I simply can't think
of a reply to that.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.327
- What about saying nothing?

07:32.578 --> 07:33.662
- Say nothing?

07:33.912 --> 07:36.457
Horrible, he must be mad.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.961
- What you do is more
important than what you say.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.296
Your deeds are more important

07:42.546 --> 07:43.839
than your words.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.424
- What is the difference?

07:45.674 --> 07:46.925
Words are deeds.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.261
Are you trying to say
that these few minutes

07:49.511 --> 07:50.387
talking in the dean's rooms

07:50.637 --> 07:52.806
have done nothing for you?

07:54.892 --> 07:55.684
Will you, for instance,

07:55.934 --> 07:57.019
ever forget that you've met me?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.814
- You're confusing what is important

08:01.064 --> 08:03.066
with what is impressive.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.235
Chapman and Hall will always remember

08:05.486 --> 08:07.738
they've met you,
of that I have no doubt.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
- Exactly, because of my conversation.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.200
Oh, they'll forget that
they were engaged

08:11.450 --> 08:12.868
in the act of eating a cutlet.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.412
- At least the cutlet
does some good to them.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.039
You do not.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.624
- I mean, Dean, that a cutlet

08:18.874 --> 08:21.210
merely influences
their subconscious life.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.711
I, by my words,

08:22.961 --> 08:24.713
shape the consciousness.

08:24.963 --> 08:25.881
I am therefore not only

08:26.131 --> 08:27.549
more impressive than the cutlet,

08:27.799 --> 08:30.219
but infinitely more important.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.679
Your dean here dwells
in superstitious clouds

08:33.931 --> 08:36.058
of Christian self-righteousness.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.518
Your dean pretends that

08:37.768 --> 08:40.479
only insensate faith
is of any significance.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.357
And daily he droops,
soporific, into his soup.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.901
- Oh, Risley, shut up.

08:46.151 --> 08:46.902
Come on.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.572
- I think if a man
has ideas like that,

08:50.822 --> 08:52.783
he should have the courtesy
to keep them to himself.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.036
- No, no, no, on the contrary,
one must talk, talk, talk.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.039
It's only by talking that we
shall caper upon the summit.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.876
Otherwise the mountains
will overshadow us.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.587
I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.135
- Wait.

09:16.139 --> 09:16.723
I'm eager to hear

09:16.974 --> 09:19.142
more of your interesting ideas

09:19.393 --> 09:21.228
about words and deeds.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.773
My rooms are in Trinity.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.484
And I have a dining club
whose members would,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.487
if I'm not mistaken, interest you.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.992
No need to bring your chum.

09:36.952 --> 09:37.828
- Oh, well.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.751
You're not going, are you?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.021
- Salutations, Risley.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.900
You've bargained for
more than you've gained.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.656
Risley.

10:16.158 --> 10:19.161
You've, uh, you've bargained
for more than you've gained.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.412
Salutations.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.833
- Look.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.342
- Come in.

10:35.594 --> 10:36.470
- Hello?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.640
You're Durham, aren't you?

10:39.890 --> 10:40.599
- Yes.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.643
- I was looking for Risley,
don't know where he is.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.729
- He's debating at the Union.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.774
I was just stealing
his pathetic symphony.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.442
I'm reading a paper on Tchaikovsky,

10:50.692 --> 10:52.819
but I cannot find the third movement.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.990
If it's here at all,
which I don't think it is.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.867
Featherstonhaugh's got a Pianola.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.077
- I know.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.121
His rooms are directly above mine.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.290
- Oh, well, I'll come back
with you then.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.501
You're living in college now?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.252
- Beginning my second year.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.504
- I'm third.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.630
I have seen you, though.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.131
Hall, isn't it?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.386
- If Risley's not coming,

11:17.636 --> 11:18.845
perhaps I'd better get back.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.431
- I didn't know you knew Risley.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.392
He's a dangerous man.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.479
A little of him certainly
goes a very long way.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.481
- You like this music?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.566
- I'm afraid I do, yes.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.070
Sweet water from a foul well,
as they say.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.697
- A good waltz is more my style.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.700
- Hmm, mine too, really.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.288
- Thank you, good night.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.998
- Good night, sir.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.251
- Hall.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.004
- Oh, got your third movement.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.047
- I thought I'd come
along with you instead.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.799
- Here, give me some of those
to carry.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.467
- It's all right, I think
I've got them safe now.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.301
Good night.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.302
- Good night, sir.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.137
- Give.

12:08.603 --> 12:09.771
- Mortarboard.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.675
This bit's supposed to be mad.

12:42.095 --> 12:42.888
- Hall.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.141
You, you should be at this end.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.479
You should get as far away
from the machine as you can.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.030
- Play it again.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.823
If Featherstonhaugh
doesn't mind, that is.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.116
- No, you can't play it again.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.493
It's a, it's a movement.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.412
You have to get right to the end.

13:07.662 --> 13:12.125
Featherstonhaugh, I think I'm
gonna eat one of your apples.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.168
Is this Sophocles?

13:13.418 --> 13:13.960
- Mm.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.588
- Try reading it for the
characters, rather than the author.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.131
It's much more interesting.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.553
Much too fast, Hall.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.555
Slower, slower.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.433
There, otherwise you'll tear it.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.407
- This bit isn't as jolly,
really, is it?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.326
- No, it's not.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.712
Appalling vac.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.339
I nearly wrote to you about it.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.674
My mother started flinging
the cat about

14:00.924 --> 14:03.927
because I wouldn't go to
Communion on Christmas Day.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.095
I mean, I'm unorthodox.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.471
I'm not a Christian.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.890
It was imperative that I made a stand.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.433
- It's a difficult question.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.519
- Hall, come down to the buttery.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.687
Oh, hello, Durham.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.106
Halliday's been given a
case of hock for Christmas.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.732
Reward for good behavior over the vac.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.067
He's asked for us.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.194
- I'm sorry, Chapman, not now.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.487
We're fixing something.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.155
- Oh, I see.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.617
Sorry, well, perhaps
we'll see you later, then.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.581
- Have you known Chapman long?

14:32.831 --> 14:36.084
- Five years,
here and at school.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.840
- Give me a cigarette, would you?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.468
I mean, you've got a mother
and sisters.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.636
All the way through that row

14:46.887 --> 14:48.638
I was thinking what you
would have done.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.516
- My mother never
makes a row about anything.

14:51.766 --> 14:52.475
- That's 'cause you've never
done anything

14:52.726 --> 14:55.270
she wouldn't approve, I expect.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.772
You never will.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.985
I'm disgusted with mine.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.696
I despise her character.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.907
There, I've told you something

15:07.157 --> 15:09.701
no one else in the world knows.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.580
- Won't tell.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.832
- Tell me about your home life.

15:16.082 --> 15:16.666
- Nothing to say.

15:16.917 --> 15:17.918
We just go on.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.336
- Lucky devils.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.588
- Rotten vac, eh?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.214
- Yes, it was, rotten.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.341
Misery and hell.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.468
Ow, that really hurt, ow!

15:26.718 --> 15:27.552
- Misery and hell, eh?

15:28.970 --> 15:30.013
- Hall, what are you,

15:30.263 --> 15:31.514
No, no, Hall, no.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.894
Please, I've got to go.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.520
Don't be such a fool.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.189
I've got to go,
I said I've got a lecture.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.566
- Why don't you go late again?

15:41.816 --> 15:44.569
- Because I can't.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.863
- You think I don't think.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.032
But I can tell you I do.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.370
- "Every human soul has

15:55.664 --> 15:59.000
"at some stage beheld
an excellent being.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.256
"Otherwise, it would not have

16:07.384 --> 16:09.511
"entered into the creature

16:11.054 --> 16:12.138
"we call man.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.435
"When the soul

16:19.854 --> 16:21.773
"gazes upon the beauty

16:24.484 --> 16:26.778
"of that being, its beloved

16:29.698 --> 16:31.199
"it nu, is nurtured

16:33.451 --> 16:35.537
"and warmed, and is glad."

16:36.997 --> 16:40.041
- Featherstonhaugh, continue, please.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.586
- "When the beloved
has made him welcome

16:45.130 --> 16:48.633
"and begun to enjoy
his conversation and--"

16:51.511 --> 16:52.804
- "Society."

16:53.054 --> 16:54.014
- "Society."

16:55.473 --> 16:57.350
"When their intimacy is

16:59.185 --> 17:00.228
"established

17:01.187 --> 17:02.647
"and the loved one

17:04.065 --> 17:05.316
"has grown used

17:06.901 --> 17:08.987
"to being near his friend,

17:11.031 --> 17:12.656
"and touching him in

17:14.576 --> 17:16.286
"the gymnasium and elsewhere,

17:20.205 --> 17:23.001
"the current which Zeus
in love with Ganymede

17:23.251 --> 17:26.087
"called 'the stream of longing.""

17:26.337 --> 17:30.717
- Omit the reference to the
unspeakable vice of the Greeks.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.177
- Ah, yes, sir.

17:34.471 --> 17:37.599
"He, he is experiencing a counterlove,

17:38.683 --> 17:41.811
"a reflection of the love he inspires,

17:42.729 --> 17:46.483
"and he thinks of it as
friendship, not love.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.196
"Though, like his lover,

17:51.446 --> 17:55.575
"he feels a desire to see,
to touch, to kiss him."

17:57.702 --> 18:00.789
- "The unspeakable
vice of the Greeks"?

18:01.039 --> 18:01.956
The hypocrisy of the man.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.208
He ought to lose his fellowship.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.709
- Oh, come on!

18:04.959 --> 18:06.795
- No, as a point of pure scholarship.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.046
All the poor old dean can understand

18:08.296 --> 18:09.631
is the physical act.

18:09.881 --> 18:10.673
I'm not advocating that.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.634
- Cold as a fish on a marble
slab, you see?

18:12.884 --> 18:13.593
- Shut up, Risley.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.345
I'm trying to make
a serious point here,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.388
which is that a masculine love

18:17.639 --> 18:20.183
of physical beauty
and of moral beauty,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.852
and of the beauty of the
thirst for human knowledge,

18:23.103 --> 18:24.562
you omit that and you've omitted

18:24.813 --> 18:27.273
the mainstay of Athenian society.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.566
It's as if our benighted dean

18:28.817 --> 18:31.194
hadn't even read The Symposium.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.654
You read it, Hall?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.823
- No, no, you missed the point.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.117
You have to maintain some
standards of decency.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.034
- No, you don't.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.786
Not if they're propped
up by tenth-hand opinion.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.287
Typical of you, I may say.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.873
- Western civilization happens
to be run on the principles

18:44.124 --> 18:47.210
of Christ's doctrines, not
Plato's bloody essences.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.462
- What exactly do you mean
by Christ's doctrines?

18:49.712 --> 18:52.924
They're open to all
sorts of interpretations.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.886
- You know, the redemption,
the Trinity.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.233
Damn Christ's doctrines.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.693
I can't prove them,
but they mean a lot

19:11.943 --> 19:13.111
to millions of people,
whatever you say.

19:23.788 --> 19:24.330
- Hall.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.204
- That was enormously embarrassing.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.288
I did actually say at 6:00.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.708
- You just made me walk out of chapel.

20:14.923 --> 20:17.425
- I just don't understand it.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.344
Your father always went to church.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.845
- I can't help it, Mother.

20:21.095 --> 20:21.888
I'm made that way.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.223
There's no use arguing.

20:23.473 --> 20:24.057
- Durham.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.475
I wonder if that's
Alicia Durham's brother.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.310
- Besides, I'm not my father.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.353
- Morrie.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.563
What a thing to say.

20:30.813 --> 20:31.397
- Well, he isn't.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.482
Really, Mother, come on.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.525
- Kitty, we are talking
about things not suited,

20:34.776 --> 20:35.485
and you are perfectly wrong

20:35.735 --> 20:39.280
Besides, Morrie is the
image of his father.

20:41.616 --> 20:42.533
Dr. Barry said so.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.578
- Dr. Barry doesn't go
to church himself.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.455
- Dr. Barry is a most clever man,

20:47.705 --> 20:48.915
and so is Mrs. Barry.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.293
- Imagine Mrs. Barry being a man.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.486
- Have you been all right?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.490
- Have you?

21:25.952 --> 21:26.953
- No.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.711
- You wrote that you were.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.374
- Hall!

22:54.624 --> 22:55.833
- Here.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.418
We want tea, we need tea!

22:57.668 --> 22:58.586
We demand tea!

22:58.836 --> 22:59.379
Hello, Durham.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.339
- A glorious
match, we're absolute heroes.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.757
- Peterhouse are abject.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.342
- And wonderful wicket-keeping.

23:04.592 --> 23:05.676
- Don't you have any Darjeeling, Hall?

23:05.927 --> 23:07.512
I don't like this Chinese bilge.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.430
- A marvelous match.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.306
Best so far.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.516
If it hadn't been for my two valiant

23:11.766 --> 23:12.600
catches in the slips--

23:12.850 --> 23:13.601
- Three wickets.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.311
Just dropping them
into the rough spot.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.813
Lt was too easy.

23:28.783 --> 23:29.742
- Hall, Hall.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.537
- Durham, where did you get to?

23:32.787 --> 23:34.705
- I know you read those books
in the vac.

23:34.956 --> 23:35.748
- How do you mean?

23:35.998 --> 23:39.252
- You'll understand then,
I don't have to explain.

23:39.502 --> 23:40.753
- Understand what?

23:41.003 --> 23:42.463
- That I love you.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.675
- Don't talk rubbish.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.351
Durham?

23:55.601 --> 23:57.437
Durham, come back!

23:57.687 --> 23:59.230
- Come on, old man.

25:13.554 --> 25:14.889
- Amen.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.527
- Clive, you're bloody hard.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.737
You don't know what it is
to have a mind in a mess.

26:11.988 --> 26:12.989
Lt makes you very hard.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.198
- Hall, don't be so stupid.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.701
You must know that to be
alone with you hurts me.

26:16.951 --> 26:17.535
- I only want to discuss--

26:17.785 --> 26:19.161
- No, please don't reopen it.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.204
It's over.

26:22.373 --> 26:23.124
I'm in hell.

26:25.251 --> 26:25.835
Oh, get out.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.712
It's only disgust.

26:27.962 --> 26:31.299
You haven't done anything
to be ashamed of.

26:31.549 --> 26:34.677
You don't know
what hell's really like.

26:36.137 --> 26:40.308
- I thought it was the
worst crime in the calendar.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.435
The one subject absolutely
beyond the limit.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.771
- Look, you've been thoroughly
decent from first to last.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.567
So decent that I mistook
your friendliness.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.570
I thought it was, something else.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.574
I'm sorry to have insulted you.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.577
- Durham, I love you,

27:01.370 --> 27:02.163
in my very own way.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.749
- Rubbish, as you so rightly said.

27:04.999 --> 27:05.625
Good night.

27:05.875 --> 27:06.584
- I do.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.670
I think I have always.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.755
- Look.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.925
It's like the good,
blundering creature

27:15.176 --> 27:19.263
that you are to try to comfort
me, but there are limits.

27:21.182 --> 27:24.060
I'm thankful that it was
into your hands I fell.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.729
Most men would have
reported me to the dean,

27:26.979 --> 27:28.689
or the police.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.483
- Damn you, Durham.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.072
- Maurice.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.492
I love you.

28:21.742 --> 28:22.785
- I love you.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.633
- Hall.

28:38.968 --> 28:39.844
- It's the dean.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.804
- Don't you have a lecture?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.556
- I overslept!

28:43.806 --> 28:46.517
- Hall! Stop when I
speak to you!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.324
- Do you realize,

29:06.871 --> 29:09.415
I would have gone
through life half-awake

29:09.665 --> 29:13.169
if you'd had the decency
to leave me alone?

29:15.713 --> 29:16.547
- Why me?

29:23.179 --> 29:25.681
Perhaps we woke up each other.

29:42.990 --> 29:43.908
- No.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.785
- Can't you kiss me?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.790
- I think, I think it would bring us,

29:51.040 --> 29:53.501
I think it would bring us down.

30:03.219 --> 30:06.096
I think it would spoil everything.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.518
This harmony.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.106
Body,

30:17.900 --> 30:18.776
mind, soul.

30:22.947 --> 30:26.700
I don't think women have even guessed.

30:26.951 --> 30:27.993
But you know.

30:50.891 --> 30:54.520
- Why did you not stop
when I called you?

30:54.770 --> 30:57.398
Yesterday you cut chapel,
four lectures,

30:57.648 --> 31:00.025
including my own translation class.

31:00.276 --> 31:04.488
And, Hall, you've done
this sort of thing before.

31:04.738 --> 31:08.868
It's unnecessary to add
impertinence, don't you think?

31:16.083 --> 31:17.251
Very well.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.044
I'm sending you down.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.630
You will catch the 12 o'clock.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.216
Unless you write me
a letter of apology,

31:24.466 --> 31:26.135
I shall not recommend your readmission

31:26.385 --> 31:28.053
to college in October.

31:28.304 --> 31:30.264
- If it had been a girl
in the sidecar,

31:30.514 --> 31:34.602
Cornwallis would never
have kicked up a stink.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.687
Everyone cuts lectures.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.983
I've done nothing wrong.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.735
I refuse to say that I have.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.403
- What'll you do?

31:46.864 --> 31:49.575
- Go into the stock
market like Father did.

31:49.825 --> 31:53.746
I don't need one of their
rotten degrees.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.749
- You will come to Pendersleigh?

32:04.340 --> 32:05.049
Bye!

32:06.884 --> 32:07.885
Boo-hoo-hoo.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.849
- Not quite
what you expected, eh?

32:14.099 --> 32:17.603
- Dr. Barry, not quite as
anyone expected.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.315
Still, these past few weeks,

32:21.565 --> 32:23.943
it's become apparent to me that

32:24.193 --> 32:26.654
it's time a man was here to
head this household again.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.281
- Well, it's all for the best.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.200
What do you want with a degree?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.285
They were never meant
for the suburban classes.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.120
I mean, you're not
going to become a parson

32:35.371 --> 32:38.374
or a barrister or a
pedagogue, and you're not a,

32:38.624 --> 32:40.793
you're not a country gentleman.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.503
No, it's a sheer waste of time.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.380
The city's your place.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.257
Absolutely right to insult the dean.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.760
- If anything,
I've been insulted by him.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.722
Treated like a schoolboy.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.394
- You see, your mother doesn't
understand how you feel.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.771
She's worried because
you don't apologize.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.898
To my mind, these things
work themselves out.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.401
You see, you've got
yourself into an atmosphere

33:05.651 --> 33:07.069
for which you were not suited,

33:07.319 --> 33:11.073
and you very properly took
the first chance to get out.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.241
- How do you mean?

33:12.491 --> 33:14.326
- Oh, still not clear?

33:14.576 --> 33:17.287
I mean that a gentleman would
have apologized by instinct

33:17.538 --> 33:21.125
if he'd found that he'd
behaved as you did.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.961
- I think it's time I turned in.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.213
- How dare you bully
your mother, Maurice.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.382
You ought to be horsewhipped.

33:28.632 --> 33:31.218
Swaggering about instead of
begging her to forgive you.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.303
She comes to me with tears in her eyes

33:33.554 --> 33:34.722
and asks me to say something.

33:34.972 --> 33:35.556
- But--

33:35.806 --> 33:36.890
- Don't answer me, sir,
don't answer me.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.184
I want none of your speech.

33:39.435 --> 33:40.686
You're a disgrace to chivalry.

33:40.936 --> 33:41.562
- Oh!

33:41.812 --> 33:45.232
- I'm disappointed
and disgusted with you.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.490
- Oh, Morrie darling,

33:53.741 --> 33:55.743
we all looked forward
so much to May Week.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.036
- Mother, do stop crying.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.204
It'll only make him
think he's important.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.749
He'll write to the dean as
soon as no one wants him to.

34:01.999 --> 34:02.958
- Kitty, I won't.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.752
- I don't see why you shouldn't.

34:05.002 --> 34:07.046
- Little girls don't see a great deal.

34:07.296 --> 34:08.589
- I see a great deal
more than some little boys

34:08.839 --> 34:11.675
who think they're little men.

34:28.192 --> 34:28.775
- Mrs. Sheepshanks.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.902
- Oh, how very complimentary.

34:31.152 --> 34:31.862
Thank you so much.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.781
Skeggs, Olivia.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.866
- Woolly, dear.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.826
- I think everyone
should curtsy, don't you?

34:38.077 --> 34:40.161
I've had such an interesting
talk with Mr. Hall.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.914
And isn't Clive handsome?

34:42.164 --> 34:43.415
- Mother, this is Maurice Hall.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.917
- Welcome to Pendersleigh, Mr. Hall.

34:45.167 --> 34:46.460
- How do you do?

34:48.378 --> 34:48.962
- Woolly.

34:49.213 --> 34:50.672
- Yes, it's so lovely
to see you.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.466
- No, leave those, come on.

34:52.716 --> 34:53.592
Oh, by the way,

34:53.842 --> 34:55.052
if my mother or my sister ask you

34:55.302 --> 34:57.179
to do this or that tomorrow,
don't worry.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.931
Say yes if you want,
but you're actually

34:59.181 --> 35:00.224
going to ride with me,
and they know it.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.391
It's just their ritual.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.185
- But I haven't brought
any riding breeches.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.855
- Ah, well, I can't associate
with you in that case.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.065
Deep breath.

35:12.236 --> 35:13.737
- You must be Mr. Hall.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.072
- I'm Pippa Durham, Clive's sister.

35:15.322 --> 35:15.948
- Yes, he's--

35:16.198 --> 35:17.449
- May I introduce Mr. London?

35:17.699 --> 35:18.283
Mr. Hall.

35:18.534 --> 35:19.118
- How do you do?

35:19.368 --> 35:19.952
Archie London.

35:20.202 --> 35:20.786
- How do you do?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.913
- I'm the lucky devil
who's to marry her.

35:23.163 --> 35:23.747
- I'm commandeering troops

35:23.997 --> 35:26.125
for canvassing tomorrow,
tariff reform.

35:26.375 --> 35:27.709
- Yes, stop bullying, Pippa.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.544
- Are you interested?

35:28.794 --> 35:30.170
- Certainly, I'd be delighted.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.713
- Good, there, Mama.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.423
Mr. Hall is sound.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.510
- Pippa, dear, does
Mr. Hall know his room?

35:36.760 --> 35:37.427
- The Blue Room, Mama.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.138
- The Blue Room?

35:39.388 --> 35:39.972
Poor man.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.682
- The one with the smoking fireplace.

35:41.932 --> 35:42.724
Simcox.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.378
- Where'd you come from?

36:11.628 --> 36:13.714
- The old schoolroom, our study.

36:13.964 --> 36:14.673
That's why you've been put to stay

36:14.923 --> 36:15.716
in this dog's misery.

36:17.301 --> 36:18.594
Come.

36:18.844 --> 36:22.556
It's as much like college
as I could make it.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.729
Look at the view, though.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.026
There, you may shoot rabbits
from this window.

36:34.276 --> 36:35.819
- Oh, it is jolly for me, coming here.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.946
- Well, this place will
never seem the same again.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.156
I shall love it at last.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.782
- Would there be anything else, sir?

36:41.033 --> 36:41.617
No, thank you, Milly.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.035
No, that's all.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.079
We're up the staircase by ourselves.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.665
We need never be in any
other part of the house,

36:48.916 --> 36:51.043
apart from meals, that is.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.045
I'll leave you to unpack.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.838
See you down there.

36:59.343 --> 37:03.472
- I hope you can find enough
to amuse yourself, Mr. Hall.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.268
- So we dressed and came down

37:08.518 --> 37:11.897
to find water lapping at
the foot of the staircase

37:12.147 --> 37:16.485
and all the waiters wearing
green leather waders.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.986
Yes, it was.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.710
- This house is his.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.254
Did he tell you?

37:35.504 --> 37:36.588
- No, he didn't.

37:36.838 --> 37:37.798
- Oh, it is.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.510
Under my late husband's will.

37:43.595 --> 37:48.141
I must move to the dower
house as soon as he marries.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.309
A fourth year at Cambridge

37:49.559 --> 37:51.144
would little profit
a yokel like Clive.

37:51.395 --> 37:54.439
He must take his place
here in the countryside.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.400
There's the game to consider.

37:56.650 --> 37:57.901
There are the tenants.

37:58.151 --> 38:00.821
There'll be his duties
as a magistrate.

38:01.071 --> 38:05.200
And unless there's a war,
there's his political future.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.787
He ought to spend the
year traveling instead.

38:09.037 --> 38:12.165
He must see America and,
if possible, the colonies.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.875
- He speaks of traveling.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.794
He wants me to go with him.

38:16.044 --> 38:19.631
- I trust you
will, but not Greece, Mr. Hall.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.341
That is traveling for pleasure.

38:21.591 --> 38:22.551
Dissuade him from Greece.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.803
- I'd prefer America myself.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.973
- Naturally, anyone sensible would.

38:29.516 --> 38:32.060
Pippa says he writes verse.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.729
Have you seen any?

38:35.731 --> 38:38.025
Mr. Hall, is there someone?

38:39.359 --> 38:40.861
Some, Newnham girl?

38:43.113 --> 38:45.032
Pippa declares there is.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.785
- Pippa had better ask, then.

38:49.036 --> 38:50.579
- Did I hear my name, Mr. Hall?

38:58.378 --> 38:59.129
- Hyah.

39:14.269 --> 39:18.565
Damn, damn, it's locked.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.275
The Goblin House.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.403
My grandfather's grandfather built it.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.572
I locked Pippa in here
for a whole day once

39:25.822 --> 39:29.534
when we were small.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.052
- Ashby's
Ordinaries are up an eighth.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.804
Three and seven-eighths,
four and three-eighths.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.389
- What's Barclay Perkins doing?

39:50.639 --> 39:53.600
- Hmm, debit one, 87.90.

39:54.518 --> 39:55.769
- Gas staged a recovery.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.064
- What about Alliance and Dublin?

39:59.314 --> 40:01.108
- Alliance and Dublin?

40:02.025 --> 40:03.193
Consumers' orders?

40:03.443 --> 40:04.027
- That'll do.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.070
- Up two.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.753
- Perhaps, dear Mrs. Hall,

40:22.003 --> 40:24.673
when Clive has finally
completed, and, pray heaven,

40:24.923 --> 40:26.842
passed his bar examinations,

40:27.092 --> 40:28.760
would Ada not like to come down

40:29.010 --> 40:31.263
and stay with us here at Pendersleigh?

40:31.513 --> 40:33.223
I do declare that our sons
find amusement

40:33.473 --> 40:35.517
in the friendship of our two families.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.102
But Ada is such an attractive

40:37.352 --> 40:39.020
and good-natured girl.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.981
Although at present
Clive appears to regard

40:41.231 --> 40:43.942
his Fridays to Mondays
entirely sacrosanct,

40:44.192 --> 40:46.403
I'm sure that he, too,
could be enticed down.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.700
I'm writing to Mrs. Hall.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.410
I thought Ada might like to stay.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.244
- Ada?

40:54.494 --> 40:55.287
Isn't that the girl whose grandfather

40:55.537 --> 40:56.705
is going to leave her a lot of money?

40:56.955 --> 41:00.750
She'll make an excellent
bride for my godson.

41:01.001 --> 41:05.130
- Really, perhaps Clive
doesn't want to marry yet.

41:07.507 --> 41:10.343
- Oh, would you be so good
as to post this, uh...

41:10.594 --> 41:11.928
What's your name?

41:12.179 --> 41:13.555
- Scudder, ma'am.

41:22.731 --> 41:23.732
- We are already snug

41:23.982 --> 41:25.233
in our little house, Mrs. Durham,

41:25.484 --> 41:28.612
now that Maurice is living
at home after so long away.

41:28.862 --> 41:31.156
Each day, he eats a vast breakfast

41:31.406 --> 41:34.034
and then catches the 8:36.

41:34.284 --> 41:37.662
He returns at 4:59,
and lays down the law.

41:38.622 --> 41:41.041
He has developed, under
your son's influence,

41:41.291 --> 41:44.836
into far more of a personage
than we had expected.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.546
One hardly begrudges him the time

41:46.796 --> 41:49.925
he spends as Clive's guest in London.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.594
Is Clive not fortunate to
have a London house now

41:52.844 --> 41:55.680
as well as beautiful
Pendersleigh Park?

41:55.931 --> 41:57.516
I do confess that I am looking forward

41:57.766 --> 42:00.018
to meeting their amusing London set,

42:00.268 --> 42:01.561
pictures of some of whom we see

42:01.811 --> 42:03.230
in the illustrated newspapers

42:03.480 --> 42:06.608
here at dull Alfriston Gardens.

42:06.858 --> 42:07.400
- But I concentrated

42:07.651 --> 42:10.779
on the tips of his mustache.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.572
- Do you think I might have
one of your cigarettes?

42:12.822 --> 42:14.407
- Do you not think
that Maurice's mustache

42:14.658 --> 42:15.575
will be the making of him?

42:15.825 --> 42:16.993
- No, it's revolting.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.787
- Thank you, Clive.

42:48.858 --> 42:52.654
- Your cavalrymen, see,
must have legs so straight

42:52.904 --> 42:54.781
that they can hold a sixpence between

42:55.031 --> 42:56.825
their legs all the way up,

42:57.075 --> 42:59.536
ankles, calves, knees, thighs.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.498
- Not only a sixpence,
is it, love?

43:03.748 --> 43:05.125
- Ends have to meet.

43:05.375 --> 43:09.212
- For the price of your beer,
no wonder.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.347
- He'll never do it.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.474
- Give the man his due.

43:25.478 --> 43:26.062
- One here.

43:29.232 --> 43:29.858
- One here.

43:31.943 --> 43:32.819
One here.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.616
The last sixpence there.

43:37.866 --> 43:38.867
- Oh, he's always winning.

44:06.227 --> 44:07.562
- Poor twink.

44:07.812 --> 44:11.900
Well, I suppose it's pints
all around, gentlemen.

44:42.597 --> 44:43.640
- Get him!

44:43.890 --> 44:44.683
- Come on!

44:45.642 --> 44:47.018
- Come here, you.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.524
- Come along.

44:53.692 --> 44:55.860
- Would you give me my hat?

46:09.184 --> 46:10.477
I'm told that if I plead guilty,

46:10.727 --> 46:12.520
the publicity can be kept
to a minimum.

46:12.771 --> 46:13.730
So what am I to do?

46:13.980 --> 46:15.940
- You must understand,

46:16.191 --> 46:17.358
if I were to give you a testimonial,

46:17.609 --> 46:20.320
it would make me a sitting
duck to any prosecution.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.071
- Yes, I see that.

46:23.031 --> 46:24.616
I realize it might
compromise your position

46:24.866 --> 46:27.786
to be seen to be associated with me.

46:29.204 --> 46:30.997
Quite understand that.

46:33.249 --> 46:34.501
Good night, Clive.

46:34.751 --> 46:35.794
- Good night.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.311
Maurice.

46:53.561 --> 46:56.356
- Oh, where on earth have you been?

47:01.778 --> 47:02.529
Excuse me.

47:05.615 --> 47:06.366
Thanks.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.210
Where have you been?

47:20.505 --> 47:21.631
You all right?

47:24.968 --> 47:25.552
Clive?

47:25.802 --> 47:27.053
- Yes, thank you, Maurice, I'm fine.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.721
Please, don't nanny me.

47:35.728 --> 47:38.481
- The defendant is a man of breeding

47:38.731 --> 47:41.359
who, rather than setting an example,

47:41.609 --> 47:43.611
has regrettably attempted

47:43.862 --> 47:47.448
the corruption of his social inferior.

47:47.699 --> 47:50.368
He is a man of considerable learning

47:50.618 --> 47:53.913
who has taken advantage
of the gullibility

47:54.163 --> 47:58.293
and the baser passions of
his intellectual inferior.

47:59.335 --> 48:02.797
Lord Risley, your guilt
has been unquestionably

48:03.047 --> 48:05.675
proven before this court.

48:05.925 --> 48:07.927
As you are no doubt aware,

48:08.177 --> 48:09.888
I am empowered to sentence you

48:10.138 --> 48:13.099
to imprisonment with flogging.

48:13.349 --> 48:17.729
However, in view of the
promising career in politics,

48:17.979 --> 48:21.357
which has been terminated
by your disgrace,

48:21.608 --> 48:22.817
and in view of the position

48:23.067 --> 48:25.904
in society which you have forfeited,

48:26.154 --> 48:30.283
I am inclined to leniency,
in sentencing you

48:30.533 --> 48:33.870
to six months imprisonment
with hard labor.

48:34.120 --> 48:34.913
Silence!

48:37.498 --> 48:39.500
I am satisfied that you
will pay for this

48:39.751 --> 48:41.419
for the rest of your life.

48:41.669 --> 48:42.879
Take him down.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.932
- All rise.

49:13.034 --> 49:15.078
- A wit, a poet.

49:15.328 --> 49:16.537
- Breeding.

49:16.788 --> 49:19.916
- Breeding, and now, legal legislator.

49:21.751 --> 49:23.002
- Legal legislator.

49:23.252 --> 49:26.130
- Clive Durham, barrister-at-art.

49:26.381 --> 49:28.800
- To Clive
Durham, our honored friend.

49:29.050 --> 49:31.594
- Barrister-at-law.

49:32.512 --> 49:33.304
- Mr. Durham.

49:33.554 --> 49:35.473
- To the most marvelous evening.

49:35.723 --> 49:38.267
- Come on,
Clive, on your feet, Clive!

49:38.518 --> 49:40.395
- To the Durhams
of Pendersleigh Park.

49:41.854 --> 49:42.730
- Oh, I say, I'm gonna faint.

49:44.107 --> 49:45.233
- Mr. Durham!

49:45.483 --> 49:46.734
Morrie, quickly.

49:47.735 --> 49:48.528
- Clive.

49:52.323 --> 49:53.116
Get a pillow.

49:53.366 --> 49:54.617
Kitty, a pillow.

49:56.077 --> 49:57.078
Ada, brandy.

49:58.621 --> 49:59.205
Mother.

49:59.455 --> 50:00.039
- What is it?

50:00.289 --> 50:01.082
- Fan him.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.291
- Oh, Morrie, what is it?

50:02.542 --> 50:04.877
- Oh, fan, fan, fan, fan him.

50:09.549 --> 50:11.926
- It's all right, silly to...

50:12.176 --> 50:12.719
- Oh.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.555
- Uh, all right, I'm all right.

50:18.975 --> 50:20.768
- Certainly not, Maurice
is going to carry you.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.105
Oh, oh, dear.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.606
Um, Mr. Durham.

50:26.816 --> 50:29.152
Mr. Durham, try and put
your arms around Morrie.

50:29.402 --> 50:30.737
- Come along, old man, up you come.

50:30.987 --> 50:31.946
- That's it.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.074
That's it, Morrie.

50:35.324 --> 50:36.534
- Come on.

50:36.784 --> 50:39.037
Put your arm around me.

50:39.287 --> 50:40.246
- Sorry.

50:40.496 --> 50:43.124
- The doctor, somebody telephone.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.294
- Sorry, Morrie.

50:46.544 --> 50:47.420
I'm a fool.

50:51.716 --> 50:52.717
- Oh, do be careful, Morrie.

50:52.967 --> 50:54.260
It's rather hot.

50:54.510 --> 50:58.056
- Mother, you needn't tell
the others I kissed Durham.

50:58.306 --> 50:59.515
He wouldn't like it.

50:59.766 --> 51:01.142
- No, of course not.

51:01.392 --> 51:04.645
- I was upset and, and
did it without thinking.

51:04.896 --> 51:06.314
As you know, we're great friends.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.815
Relations almost.

51:08.066 --> 51:10.401
- Mother, the doctor's here.

51:19.494 --> 51:22.830
- Where shall I put
the hot-water bottle?

51:44.102 --> 51:47.688
- You mustn't do this sort of thing.

51:47.939 --> 51:49.941
You mustn't, it's filthy.

51:50.191 --> 51:51.484
- Lt doesn't worry me.

51:51.734 --> 51:54.403
I don't say this just to please you.

51:54.654 --> 51:58.908
You can carry on all night
as far as I'm concerned.

51:59.158 --> 52:01.828
Although the doctor's coming up.

52:02.078 --> 52:04.539
- He'll see me like this.

52:04.789 --> 52:06.165
- I hope he does.

52:08.209 --> 52:09.710
Oh, hello, Jowitt.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.629
Sorry to call you out so late.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.257
I'm just curious, chap.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.884
He, uh, he fainted at dinner,

52:17.760 --> 52:20.263
and he can't stop crying.

52:20.513 --> 52:22.265
- Been working hard?

52:22.515 --> 52:26.227
- Yes, and now he
says he's going to Greece.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.186
- So he shall.

52:27.436 --> 52:28.980
You clear out now.

52:29.230 --> 52:30.982
Told your sisters none of you
were to come into this room.

52:31.232 --> 52:34.735
- My sisters, yes,
I'm looking after him.

52:34.986 --> 52:35.862
- You equally.

52:36.112 --> 52:39.031
Miss Kitty has telephoned to
the institute for a nurse.

52:39.282 --> 52:41.200
- Why is everything done
in such a damned hurry?

52:41.450 --> 52:43.327
- I thought a nurse might amuse him.

52:43.578 --> 52:45.288
- Can't we amuse him?

52:45.538 --> 52:47.039
I can nurse him myself.

52:47.290 --> 52:50.293
- Oh, have you wheeling the baby next.

52:50.543 --> 52:52.211
- Beg your pardon?

52:52.461 --> 52:55.381
- I suppose I ought to have the nurse.

52:55.631 --> 52:56.340
- Right.

52:58.634 --> 53:02.388
She can make you more
comfortable than I can.

53:19.197 --> 53:20.156
Pendersleigh today?

53:20.406 --> 53:21.115
- Yes.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.533
- Mother, he can hardly stand up.

53:22.783 --> 53:23.367
What does Jowitt say?

53:23.618 --> 53:25.036
- He seems to think
he's well enough to leave.

53:25.286 --> 53:26.245
- Keep him there.

53:26.495 --> 53:27.205
I'll get the 1:40.

53:27.455 --> 53:28.915
Someone will have to
talk sense to you people.

53:29.165 --> 53:29.707
Good-bye.

53:29.957 --> 53:30.583
What?

53:30.833 --> 53:31.918
- Shall I send the car?

53:32.168 --> 53:33.544
- No, I'll get a cab from the station.

53:40.301 --> 53:40.885
How much do I owe?

53:41.135 --> 53:42.428
- Fourpence, governor.

53:42.678 --> 53:43.638
- Thank you.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.599
Thank you very, very
much for being so kind.

53:46.849 --> 53:49.685
- Well, I hope you get better soon.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.902
We've enjoyed having him
here, haven't we, Mother?

53:58.152 --> 53:59.153
- What are you playing at, Clive?

53:59.403 --> 54:00.947
You're far too ill to travel.

54:01.197 --> 54:03.908
- I can't go on being such a
bore to your family, Maurice.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.076
- Don't be absurd.

54:05.326 --> 54:06.285
- Such good friends.

54:06.535 --> 54:08.955
As he says, relations almost.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.292
- Mother, Mother, get in.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.753
- Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.214
- Thank you so much.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.340
- Good-bye, Mrs. Durham.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.510
Don't let your coachman bump about.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.388
- Bye-bye.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.978
- Good-bye, and
don't forget his embrocation.

54:32.228 --> 54:34.605
And fuller's earth, remember.

54:55.126 --> 54:56.502
- I'll tell cook.

55:06.679 --> 55:10.433
- Terrible affair about
Viscount Risley, sir.

55:12.268 --> 55:16.147
And him a parliamentary
private secretary, too.

55:23.446 --> 55:26.032
I did read he was at Cambridge.

55:29.368 --> 55:30.328
Like yourself, sir.

55:30.578 --> 55:33.039
- You will never mention
that subject again, Simcox,

55:33.289 --> 55:36.250
while you remain in employment here.

55:39.962 --> 55:43.507
I've become a barrister so
that I may enter public life.

55:43.758 --> 55:44.967
But why should I enter public life?

55:45.217 --> 55:45.885
Who wants me?

55:46.135 --> 55:47.762
- Your mother says the country does.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.847
- Well I've talked to more
people than my mother,

55:50.097 --> 55:51.766
and I tell you no one wants us,

55:52.016 --> 55:54.101
or anything really,
except a comfortable home.

55:54.352 --> 55:55.603
- But to give people
a comfortable home

55:55.853 --> 55:57.563
is what public life is for.

55:57.813 --> 55:59.398
- ls or ought to be?

55:59.648 --> 56:01.400
- Well, it's all the same.

56:01.650 --> 56:03.444
- Well, "is" and "ought"
are not the same.

56:03.694 --> 56:05.071
- Quite right, Mrs. Hall.

56:05.321 --> 56:06.197
- You sound as if you have no use

56:06.447 --> 56:09.325
whatsoever for Greece, Mr. Hall.

56:09.575 --> 56:11.494
- Lt sounds out of repair.

56:11.744 --> 56:14.955
A heap of old stones
without any paint on.

56:15.206 --> 56:15.831
- We shall know what it is

56:16.082 --> 56:18.042
if you fall over this time,
Mr. Durham.

56:20.002 --> 56:22.463
- Your health, and the
health of all the ladies.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.131
Maurice, come.

56:24.382 --> 56:25.216
The ladies.

56:26.509 --> 56:27.927
- Oh, the ladies.

56:28.969 --> 56:29.970
- The ladies.

57:08.509 --> 57:11.720
- Dear Clive,
still no word from you,

57:11.971 --> 57:14.056
so here is my news.

57:14.306 --> 57:17.893
I am practicing a regimen
of severe self-discipline.

57:18.144 --> 57:19.603
Our Wednesdays and our weekends

57:19.854 --> 57:22.106
I spend in the darkest
reaches of Bermondsey

57:22.356 --> 57:25.234
with the dockers lads at the mission.

57:25.484 --> 57:28.696
It's a far cry from our
metropolitan pleasures.

57:28.946 --> 57:32.491
I am supposed to be teaching
them the gentle art of boxing.

57:32.741 --> 57:36.120
More often than not,
I get the pummeling.

57:36.370 --> 57:37.830
Preferable to the pummeling
you gave me

57:38.080 --> 57:40.332
at the Wigmore Hall, ha, ha.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.002
Most of the other evenings
I spend working

57:43.252 --> 57:46.088
through that reading
list you once gave me.

57:46.338 --> 57:49.508
Clive, I'm so worried
at not hearing from you.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.469
I get no sleep worrying

57:51.719 --> 57:54.930
for fear that you've fallen ill again.

57:55.181 --> 57:55.973
I've looked out your connections

57:56.223 --> 57:58.601
and would expect you back
by Tuesday week.

57:58.851 --> 58:01.604
Wire, if you can, on reaching Dover.

58:01.854 --> 58:04.899
I don't have to tell
you how much I miss you.

58:05.149 --> 58:06.400
- Mr. Durham.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.736
Oh, Maurice is away tonight
on business.

58:08.986 --> 58:09.987
- Oh, no, where's he gone?

58:10.237 --> 58:10.988
- Don't ask me.

58:11.238 --> 58:12.406
We know even less about him than when

58:12.656 --> 58:14.116
you were last here, if
you think that's possible.

58:15.367 --> 58:18.329
He keeps everything so secret.

58:18.579 --> 58:19.455
Mother, Ada,

58:19.705 --> 58:21.790
Mr. Durham is back from Greece.

58:22.041 --> 58:23.375
What was Greece like?

58:23.626 --> 58:25.002
- Um, rather disappointing,
I'm afraid.

58:25.252 --> 58:27.421
It's not exactly what
I'd expected it would be.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.089
- Why didn't you let us know?

58:29.340 --> 58:30.174
There'll be nothing but pie.

58:30.424 --> 58:31.884
We would've given you
a real English dinner.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.511
- Don't worry, I can't
stay to dinner anyway--

58:33.761 --> 58:35.387
- No, Mr. Durham,
you must stop the night.

58:35.638 --> 58:38.182
We've missed you,
haven't we, Ada, Kitty?

58:38.432 --> 58:40.184
Maurice told us
you'd be back last week.

58:40.434 --> 58:41.435
He was so disappointed.

58:41.685 --> 58:42.686
- We can practice on you.

58:42.937 --> 58:44.396
We've joined an ambulance class.

58:44.647 --> 58:46.565
We need a victim to bandage up.

58:46.815 --> 58:48.108
Lt was Dr. Barry's idea.

58:48.359 --> 58:50.528
He says there's going
to be a war soon.

58:50.778 --> 58:52.530
- You sound just like Maurice.

58:52.780 --> 58:54.323
Your voices are wonderfully alike.

58:54.573 --> 58:55.533
- It's 'cause I have a cold.

58:55.783 --> 58:58.536
- No, you are alike, you
do have the same voice.

58:58.786 --> 59:00.412
And nose, and by that, of course,

59:00.663 --> 59:01.830
I mean the mouth, too.

59:02.081 --> 59:04.250
And also his good spirits
and good health.

59:04.500 --> 59:07.836
Kitty, on the other hand,
has his brains.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.130
- Ow, that really hurts!

59:10.381 --> 59:11.215
- Ow, ow.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.008
- Yeah, well, it's my hair.

59:15.511 --> 59:16.804
That's very good, Kitty.

59:17.054 --> 59:17.846
Thank you.

59:19.014 --> 59:22.601
These are excellent,
I feel so much better.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.479
If you knew what it was
to be in England.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.022
- ls Greece not nice?

59:27.273 --> 59:28.482
- Horrible.

59:28.732 --> 59:31.068
- Maurice said you'd like Greece.

59:31.318 --> 59:33.153
- Maurice doesn't know.

59:34.446 --> 59:35.823
- I'm happy you're back.

59:37.783 --> 59:39.243
- Maurice is home.

59:43.664 --> 59:44.540
- Clive.

59:46.250 --> 59:49.378
Come out of all that, Clive.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.338
Why did you let them?

59:52.548 --> 59:54.174
I say he looks well.

59:56.677 --> 59:57.845
You look well.

59:58.095 --> 59:59.054
Come and have a drink.

59:59.305 --> 01:00:00.014
I'll unpick you.

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:01.765
No, girls, not you.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.739
Why didn't you answer my letters?

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:19.283
Don't you love me anymore?

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.744
- All that must be tomorrow.

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:24.204
- Quite so.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.206
Have a drink.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.169
- Maurice, I don't want a row.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.632
- I do, I want a row,
and I'll have it.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.636
Why didn't you write?

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:41.138
What secrets are you keeping from me?

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.223
- I was trying to work things out,

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.142
and I couldn't explain in a letter.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:49.563
- One oughtn't to have
secrets, or they get worse.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.732
One ought to talk.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.525
- No, thank you.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.944
Talk, talk, talk.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:59.031
Provided one has someone to talk to.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.491
As you and I have.

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:01.617
- I've thought about this solidly

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.119
for the last month and a half.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.830
We've got to change, you and I.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.875
- Can the leopard change his spots?

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.211
Clive, you're in a muddle.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.673
What is it you're afraid to tell me?

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:19.468
Surely we've got past
sparing each other.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.221
You can't trust anyone else.

01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.931
You and I are outlaws.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.892
All this will be taken away
from us if people knew.

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.102
- Precisely.

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:30.521
By continuing like this,

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.982
you and I are risking
everything we have.

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:37.569
Our careers, our,
our families, our names.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.862
- Balls!

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:41.657
I don't give a damn about name.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.994
What sort of a life
would I have without you?

01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:48.706
I risk everything, and gladly,

01:01:48.956 --> 01:01:52.543
because the one thing
I dread losing is you.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.671
You're the only happiness
there is for me.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:59.425
- There are other ways
to be happy, you know.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:02.219
We could explore those a little.

01:02:04.263 --> 01:02:04.930
- Not for me.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.599
- Maurice, think how
easy life is for people

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:10.519
who don't have to go through all this.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:11.770
This secrecy.

01:02:13.939 --> 01:02:15.983
Never being able to talk
about the person

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.027
whom you're in love with to anybody.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:21.989
Imagining the servants
are thinking things.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.323
And always being asked
when you're gonna

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:25.117
get married, and having
every bloody girl

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.368
paraded in front of you

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:27.661
'cause your family's so desperate.

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:31.206
- You want to
get married, is that it?

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.667
You're in love with some girl?

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:34.501
Who is it?

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:35.502
- No one.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.338
But don't you think
it would be wonderful

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.966
if there, if there was someone

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.594
who I could care about in the same way

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.095
that I do about you?

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.639
- We love each other, and know it.

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:48.849
- For God's sake, Maurice,

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.184
hold your tongue for a moment.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:53.270
If I were in love with anyone now,

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.523
then it would be with some nice girl.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.610
Like Ada.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.903
- Ada?

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:02.362
- I take her
at random as an example.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:03.739
- You scarcely know Ada.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.282
- Don't be so stupid.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.950
Try to understand.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:09.620
We must change.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.040
I like you enormously.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.959
More, more than any man I've ever met.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:20.297
- Did you say something to
Ada just before I came in?

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:23.133
Didn't you hear my car come up?

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.968
Why did Kitty and my mother
come out and,

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:26.094
and not you and Ada?

01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:29.014
- Look, I really can't be
cross-examined about your sister.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:29.848
- Why not?

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:32.768
- You must shut up and
concentrate, Maurice.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:33.560
- Ada.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:34.561
- What for?

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:35.354
- Ada.

01:03:35.604 --> 01:03:36.980
- Maurice, no,
it mustn't end in a row.

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:37.981
- Ada, Ada.

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:39.817
- No, you can't drag in
a woman, I won't have it.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:40.651
- Give me the key!

01:03:40.901 --> 01:03:41.652
- Leave it!

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.279
Maurice, don't make it worse.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:51.995
- I didn't mean to.

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:55.165
Did I hurt you?

01:03:56.375 --> 01:03:57.960
- I'm all right.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.003
- What an ending.

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:01.255
What an ending!

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:05.259
Maurice?

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.845
- What's gonna happen to me?

01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:10.806
I'm done for.

01:04:11.849 --> 01:04:12.432
- Maurice?

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.226
Clive, what's the matter?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.060
- Ada.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.854
Nothing, it's fine.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.524
- What's happened to your lip?

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:21.900
- It's perfectly all right.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.861
Just fooling about.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:32.661
Maurice?

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:36.748
Don't be an ass.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:41.044
Yes, he's, he's fine.

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:24.630
- What's the matter with you?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.131
- Nothing.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.175
- Yes, there is, I can see it.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.551
You can't take me in.

01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:30.344
- No, really, Maurice.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.095
It's, it's nothing.

01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:33.764
- Why,

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.101
what did he say?

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:39.811
- Nothing.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.273
- Who said nothing?

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:45.943
- Clive, he said nothing.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.361
- Clive, is it?

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:52.074
What is Mr. Durham to you?

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:56.370
Answer.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:06.338
Do you want to know what
he told me just now,

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:10.258
when I accused him
of making love to you

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:11.468
behind all our backs?

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:12.302
- What?

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.220
- When I hit him?

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.638
- No, Maurice.

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:18.392
- He said that you, he said
you threw yourself at him.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:19.226
- No.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.728
- That you, you tried to corrupt him.

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:24.147
He complained that you,
you made advances to him.

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:27.776
And that, that's why he wouldn't stay.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.737
That's why he's gone back to town.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:34.741
You, you have the satisfaction of

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:38.036
breaking up our friendship at least.

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:44.001
- You've always been unkind to us.

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:45.043
Always.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.841
- It's, it's not my fault.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:55.303
Lt isn't.

01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:06.356
- Stop, remember, step back.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.108
That's it.

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:43.143
- That's good of you, sir.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.937
There ain't many city gents
that'd give up their Saturdays.

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:47.439
Good night, sir.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:51.818
- Oh, good night, Mr. Hall, sir.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:31.608
- Children, Clive Durham
is engaged to be married.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.359
How friendly of his mother to tell me.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.903
- Who is she?

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:36.529
- Lady Anne Woods.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.157
You can read it for yourself later.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.451
He met her in Greece.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.662
"Lady Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.796
- Oh, Mother, you got it wrong.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.339
What Mrs. Durham wrote is

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.424
"I will now tell you the name
of the lady,

01:08:56.675 --> 01:08:59.886
"Anne Woods,
daughter of Sir H. Woods."

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.774
- Do you know her, Maurice?

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:13.817
- Oh, yes.

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:16.319
- Mr. Chapman, Miss Hall.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.444
- Thank you.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:26.621
- Ada.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:35.087
Ada, I behaved badly to you
after Clive's last visit.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.923
He, he never said those things

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:39.134
I let you think he said.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.303
He never blamed you.

01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:43.388
- I don't care whether he did.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.808
Lt doesn't signify, I love Arthur now.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:50.145
- Chapman's a good fellow.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:57.068
For two people in love, to
marry strikes me as very jolly.

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:00.989
I wish you happiness.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:06.786
- Hello.

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.079
- Mr. Hall, please.

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.956
- Hall, Hall, for you.

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:14.669
- Argentine Northern Land,
gone up again.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.962
- Hmm, up six.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:17.881
- Hello.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.508
- Hello, Maurice.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.595
You'll have heard my news.

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:29.142
- Yes, but you didn't write,
so I didn't.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:30.852
- Quite so.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.062
Well, the wedding's next month.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.855
You'll be an usher?

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.358
- Best of luck.

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:37.275
- Anne's with me.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.361
She wants to talk, too.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.491
- I'm Anne Woods.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:45.909
- My name's Hall.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.578
Maurice Christopher Hall.

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:52.290
- Mine's Anne Clare Wilbraham Woods.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.794
But I can't think of anything to say.

01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:57.671
You're the eighth friend of Clive's

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.548
I've spoken to this morning like this.

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:01.675
- Eighth?

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:03.760
- Yes, the eighth.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.138
I'll give Clive a turn, good-bye.

01:11:07.389 --> 01:11:08.723
- Maurice,
Anne has a hundred pounds

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:10.684
in her pocket, would
you invest it for her?

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:12.269
- Certainly, what sort of thing?

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:13.561
- Whatever you fancy.

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:17.440
- I'm not supposed to fancy
more than four percent.

01:11:17.691 --> 01:11:19.359
- Barclay Perkins.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.568
Brewing and distillers.

01:11:20.819 --> 01:11:22.487
They're at five percent.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:24.656
Or there's Argentine Northern Land.

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:27.325
They've gone up a sixth,
land investments.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:28.159
How about--

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.954
- I like the last one best.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:31.788
- Very well.

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.498
Send the check here, would you?

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.583
- Can't you come
down to Pendersleigh next week?

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:36.584
It's short notice, I know,

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.336
but later everything's
gonna be chaotic.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.714
- I'm afraid I can't do that very well.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:41.965
Hill's getting married, too.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:45.051
Things are more or less busy here.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:48.138
And after that,
Chapman's marrying Ada.

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.265
- Well, uh, come in September.

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.433
Not October, because that's almost

01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:52.559
certainly the by-election.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.311
But come in September
and see us through

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:57.814
that awful Park versus
Village cricket match.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.024
- All right.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.027
You'd better write nearer the time.

01:12:02.277 --> 01:12:03.320
- All right.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:05.739
Goodbye, then, Maurice.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.115
- Goodbye.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:08.116
- Goodbye.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.590
- I mean, I haven't even
got a consulting room.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.677
- It's an illness too
awfully intimate for Jowitt.

01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:12.347
You're the only doctor alive
I dare tell.

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:13.932
- A secret trouble, eh?

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:16.601
Yeah, right, well, excuse me, my dear.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.269
Won't be a moment.

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:21.731
Come along, then.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.836
Now, now, now take your time.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.256
And remember, of course,
that this is professional.

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:50.635
Nothing you say will ever
reach your mother's ears.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:02.647
- It's about women.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:06.651
- Well, we'll soon fix that up.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.695
- Fix me, for God's sake.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:09.988
I'm done for.

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:11.990
- Now don't be afraid of me.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.952
Now, when did you catch
the beastly thing?

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.913
- It's nothing as filthy as that.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:22.792
Ln my own wrong way
I've kept myself clean.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.795
- Oh, well, um, let's have a look.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:56.951
- ls that
you in there, Dr. Barry?

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:59.287
- It's all right, Ettie.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:00.497
I'm in here.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.850
You're all right.

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:25.396
- What do you mean, sir,
by "all right"?

01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:26.397
- Well, what I say.

01:15:26.648 --> 01:15:27.815
You're a clean man.

01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:30.026
Nothing wrong with you down there.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.111
You could marry tomorrow if you like.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:35.156
If you'll take an old
man's advice, you will.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:36.074
So cover up now.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.825
It's so, so drafty.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:43.248
What put all this
into your head?

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:44.749
- You've never guessed.

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.128
I'm like Lord Risley.

01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:54.217
I'm an unspeakable.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.887
The Oscar Wilde sort.

01:15:59.514 --> 01:16:01.057
- Rubbish, rubbish.

01:16:02.267 --> 01:16:04.477
- Dr. Barry, I can't have explained.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:06.604
- Now listen to me, Maurice.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:09.107
Never let that evil hallucination,

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:12.360
that temptation from the
devil, occur to you again.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.571
I mean, who put that lie
into your head?

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:17.490
You, whom I see and know
to be a decent fellow.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:18.616
- Dr. Barry, I want--

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.243
No, sir, I'll not discuss!

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:22.704
The worst thing I could
do for you is to discuss.

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:25.123
- It's not rubbish to me.

01:16:25.373 --> 01:16:26.624
- Rubbish!

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:29.627
- I've been like this
ever since I can remember,

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.713
without knowing why.

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:33.006
Am I diseased?

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:37.302
If I am, I want to be cured.

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:39.846
- Find yourself a pretty young woman.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.931
She'll soon cure you.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.017
It's unspeakable.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.977
Come, dress yourself.

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:49.147
- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:50.231
Of course.

01:16:50.481 --> 01:16:52.775
- Ettie, whiskey.

01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:37.862
- Mine.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:43.826
- Sir.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.669
- Bull's-eye, one less bunny wunny

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:54.712
for Durham to lose sleep over.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.047
What?

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.715
Oh, buck up, man.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.467
Corpore sano.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:00.760
Look out, mine!

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:03.888
Damn!

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:08.351
- Will you gentlemen wish
to continue shooting?

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.269
The mist's coming down.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.897
- I suppose he thinks it's our fault.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.232
Very well, Scudder.

01:18:14.482 --> 01:18:16.109
We may as well pack it in.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.278
You'll bring the game
book up to the house.

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:21.322
Oh, cheer up, old man.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:23.366
What has got into you?

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:29.122
- Would you believe it's my birthday?

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.541
- Good Lord, is it really?

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.793
I say, old man, many happy returns.

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.171
Durham never mentioned it at all.

01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:39.757
- Durham's far too busy canvassing.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.092
Come on.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.552
Let's toast it in chiskey.

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:45.638
- That's more like it.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.524
- Telegram arrived for you
at midday, sir.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:58.317
- Oh, thank you, Simcox.

01:18:58.568 --> 01:18:59.152
- There, you see?

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:02.238
Durham did remember your birthday.

01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:06.117
- Shall we have that drink?

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:08.578
- Mm, two large chiskeys, Simcox.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:10.163
- Very good, sir.

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:25.845
- I think I may have to go
to town with you tomorrow.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.764
- Hall, old fellow, what a pity.

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:29.682
You might have had more shooting.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.476
Nothing wrong, is there?

01:19:31.726 --> 01:19:34.020
- No, have business.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.063
- Happy birthday, sir.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.823
- Hello, did you have
a good day shooting?

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.241
- Frightful.

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:50.077
- It's awfully rude of Clive
to have been here so little,

01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:52.121
but he's working so hard.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:53.831
And I do think it'll be a good idea

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.042
for the poor if he does get in, don't you?

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.377
He's their best friend,
if only they knew it.

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:00.713
- You can't worry too much
about the poor.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:01.839
One must give them a leg up,

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:02.799
for the sake of the country,

01:20:03.049 --> 01:20:05.718
but they don't suffer as
we should in their place.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:09.472
- I see we're in the hands of
the right sort of stockbroker.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.140
Oh, here's the Reverend Borenius.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:13.434
He's joining us for
dinner, do you know him?

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:16.854
He's come to scold Clive
about the tenants' housing.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.148
Now, he would say that they want love.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.400
- No doubt they do,
but they won't get it.

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:22.527
- Mr. Hall.

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:25.029
I scold Clive for being cynical,

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:27.323
but really, I think
you're being horrible.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.033
- I get used to being horrible.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.868
The poor get used to their slums.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:32.495
After you've banged about a bit,

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.831
you get used to your particular hole.

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:36.833
Everyone yaps at first.

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:40.586
I've had a telegram.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:41.838
I've got to go back up
to town tomorrow.

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:43.714
- Oh, no, not bad news I hope.

01:20:43.965 --> 01:20:44.715
- No.

01:20:44.966 --> 01:20:48.803
- Well, in that case, it
must be an amorous intrigue.

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:50.721
Maurice has to go back
to London tomorrow.

01:20:50.972 --> 01:20:52.056
- What?

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:53.850
- Well, that's what he told me.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.476
- But damn it,
he's only just arrived.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.019
- He had a telegram.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.479
He's being awfully secretive.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:59.856
- He's being impossible.

01:21:00.106 --> 01:21:01.983
What about the cricket?

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:05.903
- I rather like him.

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:13.077
I have a private notion he's in love.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:22.420
I think he has a little girl
up in London.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.135
- Your hand, Pippa.

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:32.471
- Darling--

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:35.850
- It's all right, Archie, I'll manage.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:39.437
Mr. Borenius, your turn.

01:21:39.687 --> 01:21:41.063
- Oh, forgive me.

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:47.486
- The family ghost again.

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:48.988
- There's
the sweetest little hole

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:51.157
in the ceiling, Clive,
can't we leave it?

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.033
- Well, we shall have to,

01:21:52.283 --> 01:21:54.785
but let's move the pianoforte
because I don't think

01:21:55.036 --> 01:21:57.538
it's going to stand much more.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:01.667
- How about a saucer?

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:04.128
Clive, how about a saucer?

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:06.505
Once the rain came through
the ceiling of the club.

01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:09.342
I rang the bell and the
servant brought a saucer.

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.510
- I ring the bell and the
servant brings me nothing.

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:12.595
- Hmm.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:15.139
- I knew this beastly
present would come in useful.

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:17.016
- Poor Pendersleigh.

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:25.399
- Milly, bring a basin
will you, and a duster,

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:27.193
and get one of the men
to help shift the piano.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:28.653
The rain's come through again.

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:31.322
- We had to ring twice, twice.

01:22:37.328 --> 01:22:38.496
- It's got right
under the sounding board,

01:22:38.746 --> 01:22:39.330
I'm afraid.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.498
- Can't make it sound any worse

01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:41.499
than it already does.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:42.875
- Shall I place this lamp here?

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.251
- Ah, Scudder.

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:45.461
Shift the piano, would you,

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.630
and, um, take up the carpet.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.009
Tomorrow you'd better go up
and attack that roof again.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.846
Well, there we are, everybody.

01:22:56.097 --> 01:22:58.265
Perhaps we'd better turn
in, leave them to it.

01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:00.810
- Before we get carried
away on the flood tide.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:04.355
- Pippa, tell Simcox to bring
up my nightcap, will you?

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.148
- The cellar will be awash by now.

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:07.984
Why is my house falling down?

01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:09.402
Anne.

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:10.861
Maurice, are you coming up?

01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:15.324
- A saucer
would have done the job.

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.411
- How very kind of you.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:33.467
- Down, down there a bit.

01:23:33.718 --> 01:23:34.552
Little bit more.

01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:35.803
More, bit more.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:36.887
Down, down.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.892
Someone will have to get up
in the night, change the bowl.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:47.148
- As soon as my body developed,

01:23:47.398 --> 01:23:49.275
the obscene imaginings began.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:57.908
I thought that some individual
curse had descended on me.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:02.913
My schooling was pure enough.

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:07.918
A terrific scandal there
before my arrival

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:11.756
meant that we were drilled all day,

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.508
and policed all night.

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:19.305
I had little chance, therefore,

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:23.684
to talk about such experiences
with my school fellows.

01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:26.270
I am the only son in my fam--

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:44.371
- Oh, Maurice,

01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:46.165
I am glad.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.461
Well, it's the greatest thing
on earth.

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.463
Perhaps the only one.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.425
Anne guessed as much.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.720
Aren't women extraordinary?

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.894
Oh, Maurice, it's what
I've always wished for you.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:08.562
- I know you have.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.107
- You don't mind if I tell her?

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.274
Only Anne, of course.

01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:14.693
- Not a bit, tell everyone.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.313
- You don't mind?

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:54.316
- No.

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:58.654
- I just wanted to show that,
I hadn't forgotten the past.

01:26:00.531 --> 01:26:01.490
But I agree.

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:05.035
Let's not mention it again.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:07.329
- All right.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.252
- Aren't you glad
it's all ended properly?

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:14.712
- How properly?

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:19.175
- Well, instead of that
muddle last year.

01:26:19.425 --> 01:26:22.428
- With you.

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.475
- Quits, and I'll go.

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:39.612
Come back here as soon
as you can, won't you?

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:54.645
- Clive?

01:28:12.288 --> 01:28:14.832
- I've been talking to Maurice.

01:28:18.711 --> 01:28:19.962
You were right.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:25.175
- Told you he had something
up his sleeve.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.418
- Make sure the
tarpaulin covers the cover.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:00.210
Pull it down.

01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:03.005
- I think he's after a tip.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:05.007
- Tell him to boil his head.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:06.008
- I offered him five shillings,

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.010
but he wouldn't take it, damn cheek.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.636
- Best of luck.

01:29:09.887 --> 01:29:11.805
I'm so glad you're not
really horrible.

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:12.681
- Are you?

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:13.724
- Good-bye, dear Maurice.

01:29:13.974 --> 01:29:15.184
- Good-bye.

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:17.853
You gave him more, I suppose.

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.774
Five shillings not good enough?

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:23.734
You'll only take gold?

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.538
- I'll take it.

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:41.460
- Clive.

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:42.795
- You're coming back very soon.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:43.629
Good luck.

01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:46.215
- Thanks, old man.

01:29:48.509 --> 01:29:49.259
- Cheerio, old man.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.052
- Archie, good-bye.

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:51.762
- Good-bye.

01:29:53.097 --> 01:29:54.681
- Thank you, Simcox.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:57.101
- Good-bye.

01:29:57.351 --> 01:29:58.185
- Bye, Maurice.

01:29:58.435 --> 01:29:59.019
- Good-Bye.

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:00.270
See you soon.

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:02.314
- Bye, Maurice.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:03.440
- Good-Bye.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:09.613
I do wish I knew the girl's name.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:27.005
- You're not quite off yet, I think.

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:33.512
- No, I'm not.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:48.610
I'm nearer off now.

01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:53.615
- Hmm.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:09.214
How do you like my consulting room?

01:31:12.593 --> 01:31:13.802
- It's a nice room.

01:31:14.052 --> 01:31:15.220
- Not too dark.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:18.724
- Rather dark.

01:31:20.017 --> 01:31:24.146
- You can see the picture
on the wall ahead of you?

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:29.818
Come nearer, Mr. Hall.

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:36.325
Take care of that crack
in the carpet, though.

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.577
- How broad is the crack?

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.330
- You can jump it.

01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:48.295
Admirable.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:55.052
Now, what do you suppose
this picture is of?

01:31:55.302 --> 01:31:56.470
Whom is it of?

01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:05.687
Lt is, Miss Edna May.

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:15.656
- I want to go home to my mother.

01:32:21.662 --> 01:32:23.997
- Miss Edna May is beautiful.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.210
She is attractive.

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:31.713
- She's not attractive to me.

01:32:31.964 --> 01:32:34.174
- What an ungallant remark.

01:32:35.259 --> 01:32:36.051
Oh...

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:38.220
Mr. Hall.

01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:43.308
Look at her lovely hair.

01:32:45.519 --> 01:32:47.604
- I like short hair best.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.940
- Why?

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:54.278
- Because...

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:03.537
Because...

01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:21.346
Did it get anywhere near?

01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:23.599
- You're open to suggestion.

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:27.269
I made you see a picture
on the bare wall.

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:31.982
- I'd, I'd like another appointment.

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:34.776
- Telephone me in two weeks.

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:38.363
Ln the meantime, uh, take
exercise in moderation.

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:42.034
A little tennis,
stroll around with a gun.

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:51.084
Go back to the country.

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:53.670
- Lt, it seems rather foolish

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.214
to make that journey twice in one day.

01:34:13.106 --> 01:34:15.067
- Hey old fellow.

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:17.819
Good Lord, you did rush
back, what a shame.

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:19.446
We're just off
electioneering overnight.

01:34:19.696 --> 01:34:21.907
I'm sorry, I, I had no idea.

01:34:25.285 --> 01:34:26.495
- But I understood distinctly from you

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.538
that all your servants
had been confirmed.

01:34:28.789 --> 01:34:30.207
- I thought so.

01:34:30.457 --> 01:34:32.834
I did think so, Mr. Borenius.

01:34:34.753 --> 01:34:36.213
- The trouble is, Mrs. Durham,

01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:38.715
that even if the bishop
can be prevailed upon,

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:42.511
I have not time to prepare
him before he sails.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:43.345
- Mr. Hall.

01:34:43.595 --> 01:34:44.137
- Ah, Mr. Hall.

01:34:44.388 --> 01:34:45.806
- Simcox informed us
that you'd returned.

01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:47.849
You're in time for dinner.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.519
Did you have a successful trip?

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.896
- That remains to be seen.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.941
- Dinner jacket's enough tonight.

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:58.485
I'm afraid we're only three.

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:20.215
- Pardon me, sir.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:23.677
Um, will the gentleman
be shooting tomorrow?

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:25.220
- I don't think so.

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:27.180
Obviously not, it's the cricket match.

01:35:27.431 --> 01:35:28.974
I'm sure, sir,
I'm very sorry if I failed

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:32.602
to give you and Mr. London
full satisfaction, sir.

01:35:32.853 --> 01:35:35.147
- That's all right, Scudder.

01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:40.444
- Glad to see you
down again so soon, sir.

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.072
- That's all right, Scudder.

01:35:46.658 --> 01:35:50.120
- The way that Scudder
sprang his notice on Clive.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:53.165
His brother has found him
a job in the Argentine.

01:35:53.415 --> 01:35:57.377
His brother has got him
the fare, so off he goes.

01:36:02.174 --> 01:36:03.592
- Excuse me, sir.

01:36:03.842 --> 01:36:07.929
The underkeeper wonders
whether you have orders.

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:09.598
- I saw him before dinner, Simcox.

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:10.807
Nothing, thanks.

01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:11.850
Tomorrow's the match.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:12.934
I did tell him.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:14.102
- He wonders whether
the gentleman wished

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.688
to bathe between innings, sir.

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:18.690
He's just bailed out the boat.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.609
- If that's Scudder, will
you tell him I'll come

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:22.319
and speak to him directly?

01:36:22.569 --> 01:36:23.904
- Very good, sir.

01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:38.960
- Good night, sir.

01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:41.004
- Oh, Scudder.

01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:43.423
Good night.

01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:49.137
They tell me you're emigrating.

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:51.181
- That's my idea, sir.

01:36:52.098 --> 01:36:54.726
- Well, good luck to you.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:56.311
- Thank you, sir.

01:36:58.271 --> 01:36:59.981
Seems rather strange.

01:37:03.193 --> 01:37:04.611
- The Argentine, I understand.

01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:06.488
- That's right, sir.

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:10.784
Have you ever
visited it yourself, sir?

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:12.410
- No.

01:37:12.661 --> 01:37:14.162
No, England for me.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:17.123
- Night, sir.

01:37:17.374 --> 01:37:19.376
- Good night.

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:27.717
- I'm off, then.

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:31.054
An easy start tomorrow.

01:37:32.222 --> 01:37:35.308
Only Mr. Hall's pleasure to wait upon.

01:37:35.559 --> 01:37:37.686
- Mr. Hall's a gentleman.

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:29.649
Was that you calling to me, sir?

01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:31.526
I know, sir.

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:34.029
It's all right, I know, sir.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:38.783
Come on,

01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:40.910
lie down.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.381
Sir, the church has struck.

01:41:35.632 --> 01:41:37.634
You'll have to release me.

01:41:37.884 --> 01:41:38.718
- Maurice.

01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:40.428
Maurice.

01:41:42.222 --> 01:41:43.640
- There's the cricket
pitch I have to help roll

01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:45.767
for the match,
and the young birds, too.

01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:47.685
The boat's done.

01:41:47.936 --> 01:41:50.230
Mr. London dived splack
into the water lilies.

01:41:52.816 --> 01:41:54.734
They told me that all young
gentlemen learn to dive.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:57.153
Well, I never learned to.

01:41:57.403 --> 01:41:59.072
Lt seems more natural-like

01:41:59.322 --> 01:42:01.825
not to let your head
get under the water.

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:05.537
I call that drowning before your day.

01:42:05.787 --> 01:42:09.916
- I was taught I'd be ill
if I didn't get my hair wet.

01:42:10.959 --> 01:42:14.587
- Well, you was taught
what wasn't the case.

01:42:23.138 --> 01:42:23.930
- Alec,

01:42:25.974 --> 01:42:27.642
did you ever dream you had a friend,

01:42:27.892 --> 01:42:30.520
someone to last your whole life?

01:42:53.585 --> 01:42:54.836
- Nice day, sir.

01:42:57.046 --> 01:42:58.506
Nice day for the match.

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:10.894
Ah, he moved that ladder
away at last, I see.

01:43:11.144 --> 01:43:12.061
About time.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.230
Now, sir...

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:19.611
what will you wear, I wonder?

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:22.280
Will you put your cricketing
flannels on straightaway?

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:23.531
- All right.

01:43:29.746 --> 01:43:33.041
- Oh, sir, in, uh,
Mr. Durham's absence,

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.879
the servants feel
we should be so honored

01:43:39.214 --> 01:43:41.966
if you would captain us for the match.

01:43:42.217 --> 01:43:44.427
- I'm no cricketer, Simcox.

01:43:44.677 --> 01:43:46.137
Who's your best bat?

01:43:46.387 --> 01:43:50.141
- We have none better than
the under gamekeeper, sir.

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:51.351
Scudder, sir.

01:43:52.477 --> 01:43:55.271
- Well, then make Scudder captain.

01:43:57.232 --> 01:43:58.191
- Pity, sir.

01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:02.695
Things always go better
with a gentleman captain.

01:44:02.946 --> 01:44:04.948
- Tell him to put me to field deep.

01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:06.282
And I won't bat first.

01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:08.034
Bat eighth if he likes.

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.620
You might tell him, as I
shan't be down till it's time.

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:12.247
- Very good, sir.

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:21.005
Oh, dear, sir.

01:44:22.090 --> 01:44:23.508
Mud on the carpet.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.679
I'll send someone up.

01:44:30.098 --> 01:44:31.266
Very good, sir.

01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:40.650
- The captain's put
himself in to bat first.

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.027
Clive Durham would never
ave done that.

01:44:43.278 --> 01:44:45.780
- Little points interest me.

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:47.949
- He's our best man, apparently.

01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:50.994
- I've an instinct
the man's conceited.

01:44:51.244 --> 01:44:52.829
- He's lasted very well.

01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:55.498
He's playing more carefully this year.

01:44:56.708 --> 01:44:57.458
- Run!

01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:58.334
- Run hard, Roger!

01:44:58.584 --> 01:45:00.378
- Throw it to the bowler's end.

01:45:00.628 --> 01:45:02.547
- They're going two.

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:11.264
- That's me.

01:45:25.862 --> 01:45:26.654
Man in.

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:45.506
- Go for it.

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:53.848
Jolly well done!

01:45:54.098 --> 01:45:54.849
Marvelous!

01:45:55.892 --> 01:45:56.684
Well done.

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:08.738
- After it, Graham!

01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:09.989
- Chase hard.

01:46:12.075 --> 01:46:13.159
- Get it in hard.

01:46:13.409 --> 01:46:14.160
Quick, they're going three,

01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:17.205
they're going three, chase hard.

01:46:30.551 --> 01:46:32.929
- I do begin to see what you mean.

01:46:33.179 --> 01:46:35.056
- Well, with a haircut.

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:50.071
- Go chase it, boy.

01:46:54.367 --> 01:46:55.410
- Wonderful!

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.452
Keep it up.

01:47:01.457 --> 01:47:02.917
- Jolly well done, Hall!

01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:05.294
- Bravo, bravo, well done.

01:47:12.969 --> 01:47:15.430
- Scudder's holding the fort for you.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.473
He's doing rather well.

01:47:17.723 --> 01:47:20.726
- Well, I suppose I'd
better play for a bit,

01:47:20.977 --> 01:47:22.395
please these people.

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:24.188
- Over.

01:47:25.857 --> 01:47:27.483
- Simon.

01:47:28.443 --> 01:47:30.236
Andrew, down to point.

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:36.325
- Clive.

01:47:36.576 --> 01:47:37.410
- Maurice.

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:39.704
- Aren't you exhausted?

01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:41.205
- Well, I've had
meetings till midnight.

01:47:41.456 --> 01:47:42.623
I've got another this afternoon.

01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:45.418
But I'm back tonight, and then
your visit really does begin.

01:47:45.668 --> 01:47:46.794
- Now, gentlemen.

01:47:47.044 --> 01:47:48.171
- We stand rebuked.

01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:51.299
To the Olympic Games, Maurice.

01:48:05.396 --> 01:48:06.272
Yes.

01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:07.190
- Take him, Simon!

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:09.567
- No, wait, sorry, Maurice, sorry.

01:48:09.817 --> 01:48:12.737
- Get it in, Andy.!

01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:18.701
- Sorry.

01:48:27.126 --> 01:48:28.920
- Well played, Mr. Hall.

01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:30.046
- Thank you.

01:48:33.674 --> 01:48:35.510
Ah, thank you, Simcox.

01:48:45.311 --> 01:48:46.562
- I know, sir.

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:48.064
It's all right.

01:48:48.314 --> 01:48:49.398
I know, sir.

01:48:53.402 --> 01:48:54.237
Come on.

01:49:04.539 --> 01:49:05.581
- What sort of man was that keeper

01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:08.000
of yours who captained us?

01:49:08.251 --> 01:49:09.085
- Scudder?

01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:11.837
Well, he's a little bit smart,

01:49:12.088 --> 01:49:15.591
but Anne would say I'm being unfair.

01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:20.429
You can't expect our standard
of honesty in servants.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.723
- What sort of background did he have?

01:49:22.974 --> 01:49:26.811
- Let's see, um, wasn't his
father the butcher at Osmington?

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.312
Yes, I think so.

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.569
Is your head feeling rotten again?

01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:36.112
- Putrid.

01:49:36.362 --> 01:49:39.532
- I do wish you'd think of
Pendersleigh as your second home.

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:42.326
Just treat it like an hotel.

01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:44.579
Come and go when you like.

01:49:44.829 --> 01:49:47.748
Doesn't matter if I'm home or not.

01:49:47.999 --> 01:49:49.542
Anne feels as I do.

01:50:30.499 --> 01:50:33.336
- Pretend to the other gentlemen
that you want a stroll.

01:50:33.586 --> 01:50:35.087
It's easily managed.

01:50:35.338 --> 01:50:38.341
Then come down to the boathouse.

01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:40.885
Dear sir, let me share with you once

01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:43.054
before leaving old England.

01:50:43.304 --> 01:50:45.348
It's not asking too much.

01:50:55.024 --> 01:50:56.150
- You should not resist me.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:57.943
You're resisting me.

01:50:58.194 --> 01:50:58.903
- Damn it, I'm not.

01:50:59.153 --> 01:51:01.197
- You're less suggestible
than you were.

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:02.031
- Don't give up.

01:51:02.281 --> 01:51:03.574
- I do not propose
to give up, Mr. Hall.

01:51:03.824 --> 01:51:07.119
- Have I fallen short of your 50%?

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.876
- I needn't remind you that your sort

01:51:14.126 --> 01:51:16.796
were once put to death in England.

01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:21.884
I would advise you to
live in some country,

01:51:22.885 --> 01:51:27.014
France, Italy, where homosexuality
is no longer criminal.

01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:31.227
- Will it ever be like that
in England?

01:51:31.477 --> 01:51:34.897
- England has always been disinclined

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:37.024
to accept human nature.

01:51:41.737 --> 01:51:45.157
- I have not told you the whole truth.

01:51:45.408 --> 01:51:46.575
- No, Mr. Hall?

01:51:50.287 --> 01:51:52.039
- Since I was here, I

01:51:56.043 --> 01:51:58.587
went wrong, with the gamekeeper.

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:01.173
I'm terrified he may blackmail me.

01:52:01.424 --> 01:52:05.094
Apparently, he's quite
smart enough to do so.

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:07.513
I have an idea
that's what's stopping me

01:52:07.763 --> 01:52:09.765
from going into a trance.

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:13.686
He sent me a letter, you see.

01:52:16.647 --> 01:52:17.523
Read it.

01:52:32.872 --> 01:52:34.582
- "Come to the boathouse.

01:52:34.832 --> 01:52:36.208
"I have key and will let you in."

01:52:36.459 --> 01:52:39.295
- No doubt he has a duplicate key,

01:52:41.088 --> 01:52:43.507
and an accomplice
waiting up at the house.

01:52:43.758 --> 01:52:45.760
- "I, since cricket match, do long to place

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.471
"both arms around you
and share with you.

01:52:48.721 --> 01:52:53.058
"The above now seems sweeter
than words can say.

01:52:53.309 --> 01:52:55.186
"Mind and write if you don't come,

01:52:55.436 --> 01:52:58.147
"for I get no sleep waiting.

01:52:58.397 --> 01:53:00.858
"So come without fail to boathouse,

01:53:01.108 --> 01:53:03.110
"Pendersleigh, tomorrow night.

01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.155
"Yours respectfully, Alec Scudder,

01:53:07.406 --> 01:53:08.783
"Gamekeeper to...

01:53:10.993 --> 01:53:12.703
"C. Durham, Esquire."

01:53:14.705 --> 01:53:16.874
- I'm walking on a volcano.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.755
He's an uneducated man, but
he's got me in his power.

01:53:23.005 --> 01:53:25.257
Will he have a case in
court, do you think?

01:53:25.508 --> 01:53:26.592
- I'm no lawyer, Mr. Hall.

01:53:26.842 --> 01:53:28.344
You'd have to consult your solicitor.

01:53:30.638 --> 01:53:33.015
My children playing overhead.

01:53:41.106 --> 01:53:44.318
- How did a country lad
like that know?

01:53:46.487 --> 01:53:49.073
Why did he come to me that one night

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:51.325
when I was at my weakest?

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.624
- There we are, sir.

01:54:06.549 --> 01:54:08.342
- Just a moment.

01:54:08.592 --> 01:54:10.845
Uh, ticket, please, ticket.

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:41.959
- Maurice.

01:54:42.877 --> 01:54:46.547
- What, uh, what brings
you to London, Scudder?

01:54:46.797 --> 01:54:50.968
- My, um, brother and I
have, um, some business here.

01:54:51.218 --> 01:54:52.887
You ought to know what it is.

01:54:53.137 --> 01:54:55.014
- I'll be with you in a few minutes.

01:54:55.264 --> 01:54:56.724
Let me just have a word
with Scudder here.

01:54:56.974 --> 01:54:59.476
Something's up at the mission.

01:55:01.812 --> 01:55:03.063
- Scudder, is it?

01:55:03.314 --> 01:55:05.774
"Alec, you're a dear fellow,"
you said.

01:55:06.025 --> 01:55:06.734
You did.

01:55:08.569 --> 01:55:09.653
What mission?

01:55:11.572 --> 01:55:14.533
What, you ashamed to be seen with me?

01:55:14.783 --> 01:55:15.826
Hmm, you're not glad anyway.

01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:16.619
Don't say you are.

01:55:16.869 --> 01:55:18.078
- Of course I'm glad.

01:55:18.329 --> 01:55:19.413
- Then why didn't you
come to the boathouse?

01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:20.331
I waited two nights.

01:55:20.581 --> 01:55:21.165
I got no sleep waiting.

01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:22.708
- Shh!

01:55:22.958 --> 01:55:24.543
- I know something.

01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:26.128
- I'm sure you do.

01:55:26.378 --> 01:55:29.256
I'm sure you could tell me
a good many things, Alec.

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:31.592
- I know about you and Mr. Durham.

01:55:44.021 --> 01:55:46.482
This is your office, is it?

01:55:46.732 --> 01:55:48.692
What do you do here?

01:55:48.943 --> 01:55:51.862
You shouldn't treat me like a dog.

01:55:52.112 --> 01:55:53.072
You was just amusing yourself.

01:55:53.322 --> 01:55:57.242
I've never come like that
to a gentleman before.

01:55:57.493 --> 01:55:58.535
You said, "Call me Maurice,"

01:55:58.786 --> 01:56:01.330
but you never even wrote to me.

01:56:02.915 --> 01:56:06.961
You made a fool of me, and
I can make you sorry for it.

01:56:34.279 --> 01:56:36.407
He's big enough, isn't he?

01:56:41.912 --> 01:56:43.539
Well, they must've owned
wonderful machinery

01:56:43.789 --> 01:56:45.791
to make a thing like that.

01:56:46.041 --> 01:56:47.084
- I expect so.

01:56:52.089 --> 01:56:53.799
Mine's got five legs.

01:56:54.967 --> 01:56:55.718
- So has mine.

01:56:59.555 --> 01:57:03.434
It's a peculiar notion,
when you think about it.

01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:09.773
Lt won't do, Mr. Hall.

01:57:10.024 --> 01:57:11.316
I know what you're trying to do.

01:57:11.567 --> 01:57:15.404
You'd do better to settle
this, I can tell you.

01:57:17.531 --> 01:57:18.407
You've had your fun.

01:57:18.657 --> 01:57:20.576
Now you've gotta pay up.

01:57:23.412 --> 01:57:26.081
I'll leave you to think it over.

01:57:36.759 --> 01:57:40.888
- Surely, surely you're an old
boy at Mr. Abrahams's school.

01:57:41.972 --> 01:57:43.515
Now, now, don't,
don't tell me your name.

01:57:43.766 --> 01:57:45.517
I, I, I want to remember.

01:57:45.768 --> 01:57:46.894
I shall remember.

01:57:47.144 --> 01:57:48.896
Um, you're not Colgan.

01:57:50.647 --> 01:57:52.399
You're not Smith, I know.

01:57:52.649 --> 01:57:54.985
You're, you're Wimbleby, yes?

01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:56.195
- My name's Scudder.

01:57:56.445 --> 01:57:58.363
- Isn't, I'm Mr. Scudder.

01:57:58.614 --> 01:57:59.531
And I've got a serious charge

01:57:59.782 --> 01:58:01.283
to bring against this gentleman.

01:58:01.533 --> 01:58:02.910
- Yes, awfully serious.

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:03.786
- My goodness me.

01:58:04.036 --> 01:58:05.579
I am really most,
most frightfully sorry.

01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:07.581
I, I, I do beg your pardon.

01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:09.958
It's seldom I make a mistake.

01:58:13.045 --> 01:58:15.172
Well, remarkable place,
this, isn't it?

01:58:15.422 --> 01:58:17.216
Not just a collection of relics.

01:58:17.466 --> 01:58:21.595
It's a place which could
stimulate the minds of the--

01:58:21.845 --> 01:58:22.846
- Less fortunate?

01:58:23.097 --> 01:58:24.515
- Well, quite so.

01:58:24.765 --> 01:58:25.974
To ask questions which one,

01:58:26.225 --> 01:58:28.227
which one no doubt
inadequately tries to--

01:58:28.477 --> 01:58:30.145
- Ben, we're waiting.

01:58:31.146 --> 01:58:33.023
- Oh uh, yes, quite so.

01:58:33.273 --> 01:58:35.150
I, uh, I, I, excuse me.

01:58:40.906 --> 01:58:42.241
Extraordinary thing.

01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:43.367
- I shan't trouble you any further.

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:46.703
- Where are you going
with your serious charge?

01:58:46.954 --> 01:58:47.746
- I don't know what came over me.

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:48.539
- You blackmailed me.

01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:49.456
- No, sir, no

01:58:49.706 --> 01:58:50.249
- You didn't?

01:58:50.499 --> 01:58:51.125
- Maurice, listen.

01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:52.501
- Maurice am I?

01:58:52.751 --> 01:58:53.377
- Well, you called me Alec.

01:58:53.627 --> 01:58:55.170
I'm as good as you.

01:58:56.296 --> 01:58:58.090
- I don't find you are.

01:58:58.340 --> 01:58:59.466
By God, if you'd split on me to Ducie,

01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:01.343
I'd have broken you.

01:59:02.177 --> 01:59:04.596
Might have cost me
hundreds, but I've got them.

01:59:04.847 --> 01:59:08.559
But the police always back
my sort against yours.

01:59:08.809 --> 01:59:09.852
As good as I?

01:59:15.232 --> 01:59:16.316
Come outside.

01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:22.156
- Lt rained even harder
than this at the boathouse.

01:59:22.406 --> 01:59:23.907
Lt was even colder.

01:59:26.076 --> 01:59:27.828
Why did you not come?

01:59:29.037 --> 01:59:30.664
- I was frightened.

01:59:30.914 --> 01:59:33.458
And you let yourself get afraid of me.

01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:36.128
That's why we're trying
to down each other.

01:59:36.378 --> 01:59:37.546
- I wouldn't take a penny from you.

01:59:37.796 --> 01:59:39.715
I don't want to hurt
your little finger.

01:59:39.965 --> 01:59:40.549
Come on.

01:59:40.799 --> 01:59:43.260
Let's give over talking, here.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:44.887
Stop with me.

01:59:45.137 --> 01:59:47.055
Sleep the night with me.

01:59:49.474 --> 01:59:50.475
- I, I can't.

01:59:52.144 --> 01:59:54.104
I've got an engagement.

01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:56.607
A formal business dinner.

01:59:56.857 --> 01:59:57.858
It's my job.

01:59:59.109 --> 02:00:01.111
Meet me another evening instead.

02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:03.739
- I can't come to London again.

02:00:03.989 --> 02:00:07.534
My father or Mr. Borenius
will be passing remarks.

02:00:07.784 --> 02:00:09.369
- What does it matter if they do?

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:12.414
- What does your engagement matter?

02:00:20.923 --> 02:00:23.425
First time I seed you, I thought,

02:00:23.675 --> 02:00:26.720
"I wish I had that one."

02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:28.055
And it is so.

02:00:30.933 --> 02:00:33.852
The only good thing to
happen to me at Pendersleigh.

02:00:34.102 --> 02:00:35.354
"Scudder, do this.

02:00:35.604 --> 02:00:37.522
"Scudder, do that."

02:00:37.773 --> 02:00:38.815
The old lady, she says,

02:00:39.066 --> 02:00:40.150
"Oh, would you most kindly

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.695
"of your goodness post this for me.

02:00:43.946 --> 02:00:45.489
"What's your name?

02:00:45.739 --> 02:00:46.949
"What's your name?"

02:00:47.199 --> 02:00:48.242
Every day for bloody 18 months

02:00:48.492 --> 02:00:49.701
I went to that front porch for orders

02:00:49.952 --> 02:00:52.246
and the old bitch doesn't
even know my name.

02:00:52.496 --> 02:00:54.206
I said to her, "What's your name?

02:00:54.456 --> 02:00:55.540
"Fuck your name!"

02:01:00.837 --> 02:01:02.130
Nearly did, too.

02:01:03.382 --> 02:01:04.258
Wish I had.

02:01:07.886 --> 02:01:11.223
And you, too grand to
come to the boathouse.

02:01:11.473 --> 02:01:12.140
"Haw, my man.

02:01:12.391 --> 02:01:16.103
"Five shillings not good
enough for you, eh?"

02:01:17.604 --> 02:01:21.566
You've no idea how you
nearly missed gettin' me.

02:01:25.237 --> 02:01:28.615
Boathouse was the place
I always fancied.

02:01:29.908 --> 02:01:33.370
I still got the key now,
matter of fact.

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:35.998
- We'll meet in your boathouse yet.

02:01:36.248 --> 02:01:37.416
- No, we won't.

02:01:48.719 --> 02:01:51.471
You'll remember that at any rate.

02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:09.823
Tomorrow's Thursday.

02:02:10.073 --> 02:02:11.533
Friday's packing.

02:02:11.783 --> 02:02:15.871
Saturday, Southampton, so
it's good-bye, old England.

02:02:21.209 --> 02:02:23.712
- You mean that you and I
shan't meet again after now?

02:02:23.962 --> 02:02:24.588
- That's right.

02:02:24.838 --> 02:02:26.840
You got it quite correct.

02:02:28.967 --> 02:02:30.761
- Stay with me.

02:02:31.011 --> 02:02:32.679
- Stay, miss my boat?

02:02:32.929 --> 02:02:33.722
You daft?

02:02:36.475 --> 02:02:38.560
Of all the bloody rubbish.

02:02:40.479 --> 02:02:42.272
Order me about again, you would.

02:02:42.522 --> 02:02:44.524
- It's a chance in a thousand we met.

02:02:44.775 --> 02:02:45.650
You know it.

02:02:47.486 --> 02:02:48.403
Why don't you stay?

02:02:48.653 --> 02:02:50.030
- Stay, with you?

02:02:50.864 --> 02:02:52.074
How, and where?

02:02:53.909 --> 02:02:54.993
With your ma?

02:02:55.911 --> 02:02:57.120
Oh, yeah.

02:02:57.371 --> 02:03:00.290
What would she say if she saw me?

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.542
All rough and ugly the way I am.

02:03:02.793 --> 02:03:06.004
My people wouldn't take
to you one bit.

02:03:07.005 --> 02:03:09.633
And I don't blame them either.

02:03:09.883 --> 02:03:10.759
And how would you run your job,

02:03:11.009 --> 02:03:12.135
I'd like to know?

02:03:12.386 --> 02:03:13.470
- I shall chuck it.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:18.058
- Your job in the city, what
gives you money and position?

02:03:18.308 --> 02:03:22.145
You talk like a man who's
never had to earn his living.

02:03:22.396 --> 02:03:26.900
- You can do anything,
once you know what it is.

02:03:27.150 --> 02:03:30.112
We can live without money,
without people.

02:03:30.362 --> 02:03:32.739
We can live without position.

02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:35.325
We're not fools.

02:03:36.326 --> 02:03:37.786
We're both strong.

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:41.748
There'll be someplace we could go.

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:47.754
- Wouldn't work, Maurice.

02:03:48.004 --> 02:03:49.923
Be the ruin of us both.

02:03:53.677 --> 02:03:54.845
Can't you see?

02:04:17.492 --> 02:04:18.660
Well, I'm off.

02:04:29.254 --> 02:04:33.300
Pity we ever met, really,
if you think about it.

02:04:42.267 --> 02:04:45.270
You paid for this room
in advance, didn't you?

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.649
I mean, they won't stop
me downstairs or anything?

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.693
- You'll be all right.

02:05:25.685 --> 02:05:26.603
Edgar, I shan't be long.

02:05:26.853 --> 02:05:27.437
Just wait for me.

02:05:27.687 --> 02:05:28.563
- Yes, sir.

02:05:41.993 --> 02:05:42.577
- Good afternoon.

02:05:42.827 --> 02:05:45.956
- Oh, yes, um, I've come
to see a passenger off.

02:05:46.206 --> 02:05:47.082
Alec Scudder.

02:05:47.332 --> 02:05:48.875
- Ah, the Scudders.

02:05:50.001 --> 02:05:53.004
Yes, I believe they're up there, sir.

02:05:55.382 --> 02:05:55.966
- Right, thank you.

02:05:56.216 --> 02:05:58.760
- Thank you very much, sir.

02:05:59.010 --> 02:06:00.053
- Plenty of time yet.

02:06:00.303 --> 02:06:01.638
- Oh, he won't be late.

02:06:01.888 --> 02:06:03.473
If Alec says a thing, he means it.

02:06:03.723 --> 02:06:04.558
- He can be late if he likes.

02:06:04.808 --> 02:06:06.101
I can manage without him,

02:06:06.351 --> 02:06:09.104
but he needn't expect
me to help him anymore.

02:06:09.354 --> 02:06:10.480
- Mr. Scudder?

02:06:14.734 --> 02:06:17.571
You must be Alec Scudder's brother.

02:06:17.821 --> 02:06:19.573
I've come to see him off.

02:06:19.823 --> 02:06:22.492
- Alec ain't aboard yet,
but his kit is.

02:06:22.742 --> 02:06:24.828
Interested to see his kit?

02:06:25.078 --> 02:06:27.122
- No, no, no, don't worry.

02:06:27.372 --> 02:06:30.166
I'll just wait with you, if I may.

02:06:31.251 --> 02:06:33.086
My name's Maurice Hall.

02:07:03.366 --> 02:07:05.702
- Good afternoon, Mr. Hall.

02:07:05.952 --> 02:07:08.330
Now, this is kind of you, Mr. Hall.

02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:09.748
I could hardly believe my eyes

02:07:09.998 --> 02:07:12.709
when I saw you among his friends here.

02:07:12.959 --> 02:07:15.045
- Family, my parents.

02:07:15.295 --> 02:07:17.464
And I'm his brother,
Frederick Scudder,

02:07:17.714 --> 02:07:19.424
purveyor of viand, at your service.

02:07:19.674 --> 02:07:22.093
- Ah, I am Mr. Borenius.

02:07:22.344 --> 02:07:24.387
Alec is one of my parishioners.

02:07:24.638 --> 02:07:26.181
I've come to give him a
letter of introduction

02:07:26.431 --> 02:07:28.600
to an Anglican priest in Buenos Aires,

02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:31.895
in the hopes that he will
be confirmed after landing.

02:07:32.145 --> 02:07:34.147
- Very kind of you, sir, I'm sure.

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:44.991
- How did you know so
precisely when the boat sailed?

02:07:45.241 --> 02:07:46.034
- Lt was advertised.

02:07:46.284 --> 02:07:48.328
- All aboard now.

02:07:48.578 --> 02:07:50.664
- May I speak frankly to you?

02:07:50.914 --> 02:07:53.500
I'm far from easy about Scudder.

02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:57.420
The fact is, he has been
guilty of sensuality

02:08:00.757 --> 02:08:01.925
with women.

02:08:02.175 --> 02:08:04.302
It's not just the deed of fornication.

02:08:04.552 --> 02:08:05.637
When the nations went a-whoring,

02:08:05.887 --> 02:08:08.598
they invariably ended up
by denying God.

02:08:08.848 --> 02:08:10.100
Until all sexual irregularities,

02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:11.476
and not some of them, are penal,

02:08:11.726 --> 02:08:14.688
the church will never
again reconquer England.

02:08:14.938 --> 02:08:16.815
I have reason to believe,

02:08:17.065 --> 02:08:20.235
Scudder spent Tuesday night in London,

02:08:23.029 --> 02:08:23.988
fornicating.

02:08:27.033 --> 02:08:28.159
I'm telling you all this

02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:31.955
because of your charitable
interest in him.

02:08:33.957 --> 02:08:36.960
But surely he wouldn't
have missed his train.

02:08:37.210 --> 02:08:38.837
Well, they wouldn't leave without him.

02:08:40.630 --> 02:08:43.425
- He's bloody well missed
his bleeding train!

02:08:43.675 --> 02:08:44.300
- Gentlemen!

02:08:44.551 --> 02:08:45.343
Gentlemen.

02:08:47.929 --> 02:08:49.431
Gentlemen, I do assure you,

02:08:49.681 --> 02:08:52.726
Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.

02:08:52.976 --> 02:08:54.394
- But his kit's aboard.

02:08:54.644 --> 02:08:55.645
His kit's aboard.

02:10:00.376 --> 02:10:01.085
- Clive.

02:10:02.378 --> 02:10:03.546
Don't tell Anne I'm here.

02:10:03.797 --> 02:10:05.715
I've only a few minutes.

02:10:07.509 --> 02:10:10.720
- I mean, look here,
man, that's fantastic.

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:13.807
She'll be furious if you
don't stay the night.

02:10:14.057 --> 02:10:15.975
Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.

02:10:16.226 --> 02:10:19.854
- Pretty well everything.

02:10:20.104 --> 02:10:21.272
You'd think so.

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:45.713
- Very well, I'm at your service.

02:10:45.964 --> 02:10:47.590
My advice, though, is
to sleep here tonight

02:10:47.841 --> 02:10:50.009
and ask Anne in the morning.

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.344
Where a woman is in question,

02:10:51.594 --> 02:10:54.013
it's always better to ask
another woman,

02:10:54.264 --> 02:10:56.766
and particularly if she has
Anne's almost uncanny insight.

02:10:57.016 --> 02:10:58.685
- I'm not here to see Anne.

02:10:58.935 --> 02:10:59.519
Or you, Clive.

02:10:59.769 --> 02:11:01.855
It's miles worse for you.

02:11:03.606 --> 02:11:05.984
I'm in love with Alec Scudder.

02:11:10.822 --> 02:11:13.449
- What a grotesque announcement.

02:11:18.246 --> 02:11:20.290
- Most grotesque.

02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:21.291
But I felt I ought to tell you.

02:11:21.541 --> 02:11:22.250
- Maurice,

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.501
Maurice, we did everything we could

02:11:23.751 --> 02:11:25.044
when you and I
thrashed out the subject.

02:11:25.295 --> 02:11:26.170
- When you brought
yourself to kiss my hand.

02:11:26.421 --> 02:11:28.298
- Don't allude to that.

02:11:32.677 --> 02:11:33.803
Come in here.

02:11:37.849 --> 02:11:41.060
I'm more sorry for you
than I can possibly say.

02:11:41.311 --> 02:11:45.523
And I do, do beg you to resist
the return of this obsession.

02:11:45.773 --> 02:11:47.525
- I don't need advice.

02:11:47.775 --> 02:11:48.776
I'm flesh and blood, Clive,

02:11:49.027 --> 02:11:52.322
if you'll condescend
to such low things.

02:11:53.907 --> 02:11:55.700
I've shared with Alec.

02:11:57.243 --> 02:11:59.037
- Shared, shared what?

02:12:00.163 --> 02:12:01.164
- Everything.

02:12:02.916 --> 02:12:04.500
Alec slept with me in the Russet Room,

02:12:04.751 --> 02:12:06.044
when you and Anne were away.

02:12:06.294 --> 02:12:07.503
- Oh, good God.

02:12:11.007 --> 02:12:12.634
- Also in town.

02:12:12.884 --> 02:12:15.178
- The sole excuse for
any relationship between

02:12:15.428 --> 02:12:18.222
two men is that it remain
purely platonic.

02:12:18.473 --> 02:12:20.350
Surely we agreed that.

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:22.310
- I don't know.

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.313
I've come to tell you what I did.

02:12:26.648 --> 02:12:29.817
- Well, Alec, Scudder,
is in point of fact

02:12:30.068 --> 02:12:31.861
no longer in my service.

02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:33.571
Ln fact, he's no longer in England.

02:12:33.821 --> 02:12:35.406
He sailed for Buenos Aires
this very day.

02:12:35.657 --> 02:12:37.075
- He didn't.

02:12:37.325 --> 02:12:41.371
He sacrificed his career for
my sake, without a guarantee.

02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:45.792
I don't know whether that's
platonic of him or not,

02:12:46.042 --> 02:12:47.710
but it's what he did.

02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:51.005
- Scudder missed his boat?

02:12:52.924 --> 02:12:55.093
Maurice, you're going mad.

02:12:55.343 --> 02:12:55.969
May I ask if you intend to pursue--

02:12:56.219 --> 02:12:58.346
- No, no, you may not ask.

02:12:59.222 --> 02:13:00.390
I'll tell you everything up to this minute.

02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.933
Not a word beyond.

02:13:35.675 --> 02:13:36.384
Alec?

02:14:21.262 --> 02:14:22.138
Alec.

02:14:25.224 --> 02:14:27.518
- So you got the wire, then?

02:14:28.895 --> 02:14:30.021
- What wire?

02:14:30.271 --> 02:14:32.857
- The wire I sent to your house,

02:14:34.358 --> 02:14:35.526
telling you...

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.236
Oh, sorry.

02:14:38.446 --> 02:14:42.492
I'm a bit tired, what with
one thing and another.

02:14:43.534 --> 02:14:44.911
No, telling you to come here,

02:14:45.161 --> 02:14:48.998
to the boathouse at
Pendersleigh without fail.

02:15:01.761 --> 02:15:04.222
Now we shan't never be parted.

02:15:05.223 --> 02:15:06.307
It's finished.

02:15:34.168 --> 02:15:36.045
- Will that be all, sir?

02:15:36.295 --> 02:15:37.713
- Yes, thank you, Simcox.

02:15:37.964 --> 02:15:38.756
- Good night, sir.

02:15:39.006 --> 02:15:40.716
- Good night.

02:16:55.708 --> 02:16:56.416
- Come on!

02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:13.893
- Who were you talking to?

02:17:14.143 --> 02:17:16.395
- No one, no one.

02:17:16.646 --> 02:17:19.190
I was just trying out a speech.
