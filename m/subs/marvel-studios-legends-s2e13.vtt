(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:31.406 --> 00:32.782
My name is Everett.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.242
Everett Ross, from the Agency.

00:34.492 --> 00:38.246
SHURI: Everett Ross,
former air force pilot and now CIA.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.915
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.251
You step out of line, you deal with me.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.379
Please, step out of line.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.761
(SPEAKING XHOSA)

00:57.807 --> 00:58.808
Huh.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.899
REPORTER: Officials have released
a video of a suspect...

01:05.982 --> 01:08.651
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.529
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.989
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

01:14.157 --> 01:15.909
ROGERS: What's gonna happen to him?

01:15.992 --> 01:17.786
ROSS: Same thing
that ought to happen to you.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.246
Psychological evaluation
and extradition.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.127
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.092
So how does it feel?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.261
Spend all that time,
all that effort...

01:35.887 --> 01:39.349
to see it fail so spectacularly?

01:46.689 --> 01:47.690
Did it?

01:51.027 --> 01:52.946
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

01:55.073 --> 01:56.991
-Agent Ross.
-Your Highness.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.868
You are buying from Klaue.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.745
Got the diamonds?

02:01.037 --> 02:02.247
Okay. That's enough.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.541
Vibranium?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.798
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

02:12.173 --> 02:15.802
Wakanda is a third world country
and you stole all their vibranium.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.804
(LAUGHING) I stole...

02:19.722 --> 02:21.224
How much more are you hiding?

02:24.060 --> 02:25.061
Get down!

02:34.737 --> 02:35.905
All right, where am I?

02:36.114 --> 02:38.116
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

02:39.075 --> 02:41.327
ROSS: Bullet wounds
don't just magically heal overnight.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.745
SHURI: They do here.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.415
But not by magic, by technology.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.459
A man showed up at the border
who claims to have killed Klaue.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.627
He's one of ours.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.879
Erik Stevens.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.338
Started calling him Killmonger.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.798
These guys are serious.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.844
His unit used to work with the CIA
to destabilize foreign countries.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.970
No.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.805
NAKIA: The king is dead.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.640
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.563
-(T'CHALLA GASPS)
-(RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)

03:11.024 --> 03:12.233
SHURI: The Black Panther lives.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.611
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

03:14.694 --> 03:16.571
I will be right there beside him.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.031
ROSS: I'm in, too.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.700
You're gonna need all the help
you can get.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.328
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Remote piloting system activated.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.296
-Yes!
-Yes!

03:37.467 --> 03:40.261
The President wants to
take offensive action against Wakanda.

03:40.678 --> 03:43.598
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

03:43.932 --> 03:44.933
Ross, what do you think?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.644
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.063
Otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war...

03:50.146 --> 03:52.232
with a country whose military capacity...

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
we can't even comprehend.

03:53.733 --> 03:54.734
Director?

03:55.193 --> 03:57.487
I think he's the expert.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.908
We are looking for the scientist
who built the vibranium detector.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.159
You owe me, Ross.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.535
You owe my brother.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.454
ROSS: We got a new director.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.373
She's watching me like a hawk.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.124
-Director de Fontaine.
-Really?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.626
-(DEVICE CHIMES)
-What is that?

04:11.709 --> 04:13.002
-That's a new ringtone?
-Shit.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.879
Director,
I'm gonna have to take this.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.589
Enough with the titles. Just take it.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.216
Actually, wouldn't mind...

04:18.299 --> 04:21.219
apologizing to you for a couple of things
I said during our marriage.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.805
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.390
What are you doing here?

04:25.723 --> 04:26.766
DE FONTAINE: The Beads.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.892
Everett Ross.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.394
DE FONTAINE: I had them bugged...

04:29.477 --> 04:32.981
I've been privy to
every conversation you've had...

04:33.064 --> 04:36.150
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.902
The Wakandans saved my life.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.237
They're a good people.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.947
Val. Val, please.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.824
It's Director de Fontaine.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.998
AGENT 1: What the hell is this?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.624
Why don't you go check it out?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.842
-Ah! (SIGHS)
-A colonizer in chains.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.261
Now I have seen everything.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.387
Funny.
