<i>I know that you're having</i>
<i>a great deal of difficulty...</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.525
<i>...being able to differentiate</i>

00:26.609 --> 00:28.361
<i>between what's real</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:31.197
<i>and what's in your head.</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:48.631
<i>With our Disney Plus series,</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:52.177
we wanted to see more of the characters
we'd introduced on the big screen,

00:52.343 --> 00:54.971
<i>but there were also characters</i>
<i>who we wanted to</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.974
<i>introduce whole cloth for the first time</i>
<i>on Disney Plus.</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:00.685
<i>Moon Knight was at the top of that list.</i>

01:02.562 --> 01:07.192
<i>Moon Knight is a spectacular character,</i>
<i>he's got an incredibly unique visual look.</i>

01:07.525 --> 01:10.028
<i>He's a much more action-oriented character</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:13.239
<i>in a way we haven't seen in a while</i>
<i>in the MCU.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:20.872
<i>Any time we think about</i>
<i>adapting a comic book character,</i>

01:20.955 --> 01:23.750
we always think about
what it is at its core,

01:23.833 --> 01:26.002
what it is on an essential level.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.047
<i>And you can't really make</i>
<i>a</i> Moon Knight <i>show</i>

01:29.130 --> 01:32.592
without embracing that darkness,
without embracing that chaos.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.347
<i>In the Marvel universe,</i>

01:37.430 --> 01:40.767
Moon Knight first made his appearance
in 1975 in <i>Werewolf By Night,</i>

01:40.850 --> 01:43.103
<i>and he was very much an antagonist.</i>

01:44.270 --> 01:47.857
<i>By the time 1980 rolled around,</i>
<i>there was such a desire from the fans</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.859
<i>to see more of him, he got his own comic.</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:53.571
<i>Historically, Marc Spector is</i> Moon Knight.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.116
He washed out of the Marines
and became a mercenary

01:56.199 --> 01:59.786
<i>and then he became the avatar</i>
<i>of the Egyptian God Khonshu.</i>

01:59.869 --> 02:02.080
<i>If you look at his origin story</i>
<i>in the comics,</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:03.957
<i>it's very Egyptology-centric</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:06.417
<i>and that's what makes this</i>
<i>different and unique.</i>

02:06.501 --> 02:07.877
<i>Kevin brought that up</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:10.255
<i>really early on</i>
<i>in the development process.</i>

02:10.338 --> 02:12.799
<i>He said, "If we can bring that</i>
<i>into our show,</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:16.261
"wrapped in a little bit of
an Indiana Jones-esque adventure,

02:16.344 --> 02:18.638
<i>"that's a show</i>
<i>that will sustain six hours."</i>

02:20.515 --> 02:23.852
-<i>I just go at it fully?</i>
-<i>Yeah, go in the camera.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:27.063
Like, it goes...
It's gotta give me the effect of...

02:27.147 --> 02:28.606
-Okay.
-He's getting the vibes.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.907
<i>Mohamed Diab</i>
<i>is an Egyptian filmmaker.</i>

02:38.491 --> 02:40.660
So collaborative, so confident,

02:40.743 --> 02:43.705
<i>who came in and really had a point of view</i>
<i>with the story.</i>

02:43.788 --> 02:47.584
I wanna show you the last thing.
This is my daughter's art.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.295
And look at this. It's Moon Knight.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.174
<i>Aw, yay! Oh, right on.</i>

02:54.257 --> 02:58.720
I read the first two episodes
and the summary of the rest of the show.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.222
<i>We just, like, delved into it,</i>
<i>me and Sarah.</i>

03:01.306 --> 03:03.516
<i>Sarah is my wife</i>
<i>and a producer on the show.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:05.476
And we had this 200-page pitch.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.270
<i>He came up with a pitch</i>

03:07.353 --> 03:09.856
that really centered on
the Egyptology of it all,

03:09.939 --> 03:12.817
and that was something Kevin was
focusing on from day one,

03:12.901 --> 03:14.944
<i>is the Egyptology, the adventure of it.</i>

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
<i>It was in</i>
<i>that original pitch meeting</i>

03:18.573 --> 03:22.994
where we all knew that he was gonna be
the best shepherd for Moon Knight,

03:23.077 --> 03:25.121
and you can see it.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.873
<i>You can see it as you</i>
<i>watch the show...</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:29.500
<i>There's so much visual foreshadowing.</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:33.588
<i>There's just so much detail</i>
<i>in his thinking</i>

03:33.671 --> 03:36.966
<i>that it really sent a current, I think,</i>
<i>out throughout</i>

03:37.091 --> 03:41.596
the cast and the crew and everyone
who touched the show to think in that way.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.723
As much as you can,
when you're doing this...

03:43.806 --> 03:46.559
<i>I wasn't aware of</i> Moon Knight <i>before that.</i>

03:46.643 --> 03:49.520
Sometimes that works
as an advantage or a disadvantage.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.856
For my case,
I feel it worked as an advantage.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.318
I wasn't attached to anything except
to make a good story.

03:55.443 --> 03:58.488
<i>One thing we realized</i>
<i>very early on is when you have</i>

03:58.571 --> 04:01.616
<i>six hours of narrative,</i>
<i>when you have four or five countries,</i>

04:01.741 --> 04:04.077
it was gonna take a bit more
of a team effort.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.995
AARON MOORHEAD:
Let's do it again, but drop it...

04:06.079 --> 04:07.789
<i>Having Benson and Moorhead</i>

04:07.872 --> 04:11.209
<i>along with Mohamed Diab</i>
<i>as our head director really paid off.</i>

04:12.335 --> 04:14.837
- Hey, guys. I'm sorry.
- Your XLR kit fell off.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.215
- Sorry. Missed you guys.
- Missed you, too.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.299
Yeah.

04:18.383 --> 04:22.387
Our first introduction
to you was your movie <i>Clash.</i>

04:22.470 --> 04:24.514
And Aaron and I watched that movie

04:24.597 --> 04:26.891
and we both took a long pause

04:26.975 --> 04:28.935
and said, "I guess
we're not filmmakers..."

04:30.144 --> 04:31.980
- "...if he's a filmmaker."
-Yeah.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.524
I loved your films.
I know it's like a ping-pong right now,

04:34.607 --> 04:37.193
I have to say the same thing.
But I loved <i>The Endless</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:38.903
and I loved it before I met you,

04:38.987 --> 04:41.447
and I thought,
"Wow, those guys have something."

04:41.531 --> 04:44.826
So, when we got the chance to work
together, that was a big thing for me.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.496
<i>When we were kicking this off</i>
<i>in the writer's room,</i>

04:48.579 --> 04:50.665
<i>one thing that became evident</i>
<i>really quickly was</i>

04:50.748 --> 04:53.501
<i>Moon Knight</i> does not have any current
connections to the <i>MCU.</i>

04:53.668 --> 04:55.545
<i>And narratively, it became really freeing</i>

04:55.628 --> 04:57.880
<i>and allowed us to really play</i>
<i>with a character</i>

04:57.964 --> 05:02.093
<i>that didn't have to abide by</i>
<i>any pre-ordained narrative rules.</i>

05:02.176 --> 05:05.888
The thing that's always been incredible
to me as a fan of <i>Moon Knight,</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:10.560
is that every creator kind of comes in
and puts their own spin on the material.

05:10.643 --> 05:15.023
<i>We were able to kind of cherry pick all of</i>
<i>our favorite things from the various runs.</i>

05:15.106 --> 05:20.486
But it's also a daunting task because
how do you distill 40 years of weirdness,

05:20.570 --> 05:24.198
into a six-hour show
and have it still make sense?

05:24.282 --> 05:27.410
Having this huge history of
40 years of comic books,

05:27.493 --> 05:31.748
you have so much to dig from.
And the best thing about <i>Marvel,</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:34.417
they allow us to get maybe
the origin of a character

05:34.500 --> 05:36.461
- and play with it the way you want.
- Yes.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.046
For us, it was about the story.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.131
Like, no one ever told us,

05:40.214 --> 05:42.133
"Okay, there's something in the comic book

05:42.216 --> 05:44.594
"that we need to put
because it's in the comic book."

05:44.677 --> 05:47.972
We would go through every
<i>Moon Knight</i> comic that ever existed

05:48.056 --> 05:51.768
and just trying to find particularly
iconic imagery that we connected with.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.978
Usually, it was the more mind-bending
stuff like

05:54.062 --> 05:56.731
<i>the image of pulling the white off</i>

05:56.814 --> 06:00.651
<i>and seeing the flesh underneath</i>
<i>on a white back... Those types of images.</i>

06:04.364 --> 06:06.491
<i>When</i> Moon Knight
<i>was first written,</i>

06:06.574 --> 06:10.036
<i>Marc Spector was basically just a guy</i>
<i>who had different identities.</i>

06:10.119 --> 06:14.248
<i>Marc Spector was a mercenary, Steven Grant</i>
<i>was kind of the millionaire about town</i>

06:14.332 --> 06:16.626
<i>and then there was Jake Lockley,</i>
<i>the cab driver.</i>

06:16.793 --> 06:18.252
And depending on what information

06:18.336 --> 06:21.172
Marc Spector needed at that time
as Moon Knight,

06:21.255 --> 06:22.882
<i>he went in different identities.</i>

06:24.467 --> 06:28.596
<i>Over the years, the different identities</i>
<i>morphed into different personalities</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:31.474
<i>and those different personalities</i>
<i>morphed into what we know now</i>

06:31.557 --> 06:33.434
<i>as dissociative identity disorder.</i>

06:34.227 --> 06:37.522
I feel like comic creators started
taking really interesting risks

06:37.605 --> 06:39.148
with the character of Moon Knight,

06:39.232 --> 06:43.486
<i>and that's where you started to see</i>
<i>things like his struggles with DID</i>

06:43.569 --> 06:47.323
<i>And his mental health</i>
<i>really kind of came to the forefront.</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.618
And it took this character who was really
introduced as just sort of,

06:50.701 --> 06:53.371
"Hey, he's a guy, he dresses up in white,
fights werewolves.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.541
"What else do you need to know?"
It really gave him some complexity

06:56.624 --> 06:59.377
<i>and really made him a character</i>
<i>that was fascinating.</i>

06:59.460 --> 07:02.004
Moon Knight is a character that
for years in the comics

07:02.088 --> 07:03.714
has struggled with mental illness.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.677
<i>The opportunity to tap into somebody</i>
<i>that faces those challenges</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:11.180
<i>in a respectful way</i>
<i>was very important to us.</i>

07:11.264 --> 07:15.476
Because of all of those different
elements, you need a spectacular actor.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.356
All right, <i>guten tag.</i>

07:20.440 --> 07:22.859
<i>We'd talked to Oscar</i>
<i>a number of times.</i>

07:22.942 --> 07:26.863
We knew he was interested in our world,
we'd never found the right fit.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.074
And we weren't sure
he would be interested in <i>Moon Knight,</i>

07:30.199 --> 07:33.369
<i>we weren't sure he'd be interested</i>
<i>in doing a show on Disney Plus.</i>

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
<i>But he was completely into it</i>

07:35.538 --> 07:38.958
<i>and he's been such a creative collaborator</i>
<i>and creative partner.</i>

07:39.041 --> 07:42.837
When I was approached by Kevin Feige
with <i>Moon Knight,</i>

07:42.920 --> 07:45.131
I had never heard of it.
I collected comics

07:45.214 --> 07:48.426
when I was younger, you know,
<i>X-Men</i> and, uh,

07:48.509 --> 07:50.928
<i>X-Force</i> and a few others.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.764
<i>And so, the first thing</i>
<i>was to kinda do a deep dive</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:56.017
<i>on the character and its history.</i>

07:56.642 --> 08:00.563
<i>Going back through the comics,</i>
<i>it's shifted and changed so much.</i>

08:00.646 --> 08:03.733
<i>It's so rich. It's pretty vast.</i>

08:03.816 --> 08:05.359
<i>And so our job was to kinda</i>

08:05.443 --> 08:08.404
<i>put a lens on the things</i>
<i>that we found the most interesting,</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:11.240
<i>or that, like,</i>
<i>had the most dramatic juice.</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:16.245
<i>And ultimately, taking the mental health</i>
<i>aspect about it incredibly seriously</i>

08:16.329 --> 08:19.665
and really committing to
what I really wanted to do,

08:19.749 --> 08:24.045
which is a character study,
a point-of-view experience.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.883
<i>DID is dissociative</i>
<i>identity disorder,</i>

08:29.217 --> 08:32.178
which is previously called
multiple personality disorder.

08:33.304 --> 08:37.099
<i>At the end,</i>
<i>it's a fictionalized depiction of DID,</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:40.019
but I think we tried our best in the show

08:40.102 --> 08:42.605
to try and understand it
and delve deeper into it.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.399
<i>The first thing I did</i>
<i>once I did finally sign on</i>

08:45.483 --> 08:48.528
<i>was to delve into DID</i>
<i>and what it's like.</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:51.239
<i>And there's an incredible book</i>
<i>by Robert Oxnam</i>

08:51.322 --> 08:52.615
<i>called</i> A Fractured Mind.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.452
And that ended up
being like my bible to me,

08:56.536 --> 09:00.164
you know, because this is someone
who didn't realize he had DID

09:00.248 --> 09:01.749
until he was in his forties.

09:01.832 --> 09:06.170
He just thought that he was alcoholic
and he had some trouble in his life,

09:06.254 --> 09:08.256
and, you know, lo and behold, suddenly,

09:08.339 --> 09:11.801
he finds out he's got eight different
people living inside of him.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.678
They're eight different alters.

09:13.761 --> 09:17.932
And so, that was astounding.
And the fact that, um,

09:18.015 --> 09:20.977
that in itself is a kind of superpower,
you know.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.522
How incredible human beings are,
that in order to survive

09:24.605 --> 09:27.858
horrible, horrible trauma
at a very young age.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.696
It's a survival mechanism
that kicks into place

09:31.779 --> 09:36.325
where the brain creates other people
within his psyche

09:36.409 --> 09:38.452
to be able to shoulder that trauma.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.498
Everyone who will watch this show
and everyone who worked on this show

09:42.623 --> 09:46.252
will have some sort of relationship
with mental health.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.172
And it was on everyone's mind
the whole time on the show

09:50.256 --> 09:52.842
to make sure that we tell
a story that's thoughtful.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.388
It doesn't have to be about something
as specific. It can actually be,

09:57.471 --> 10:00.099
teach you about just something
we've all experienced,

10:00.182 --> 10:04.020
which is trying to care for and be with
somebody that's struggling.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.652
Let's go. Thank you...

10:11.736 --> 10:14.614
<i>Our head writer Jeremy Slater,</i>
<i>one thing he was very passionate about</i>

10:14.697 --> 10:19.535
is really making episodes 101 and 102
Steven's episodes.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.078
I always knew that

10:21.162 --> 10:23.873
starting the show with Marc
was going to be very tough.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.959
Because in our show,
Marc is a very closed-off character.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.755
<i>We would be fighting an uphill battle</i>
<i>for the entirety of the series.</i>

10:30.838 --> 10:34.717
<i>I really looked at Steven Grant and said,</i>
<i>"That's a story I know how to tell."</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:38.638
<i>Once you're onboard with</i>
<i>who Steven Grant is as a character,</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:40.056
you're in for the entire run.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.934
I have to give it to Marvel
and Jeremy Slater.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.396
I think one of the most brilliant things
in the show was the idea of

10:47.480 --> 10:50.107
seeing the world through Steven's eyes.
I loved that.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.278
Starting with a mystery altogether, like,
episode one is a big question mark,

10:54.362 --> 10:55.780
which is, "What's going on?"

10:55.863 --> 10:56.989
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.493
And sometimes, there's a temptation
to get through it

11:00.576 --> 11:03.329
so you can see
Moon Knight beat somebody up.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.748
We don't see that
until the end of episode two.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.959
It takes almost the entire length of
a feature film until you see

11:09.043 --> 11:11.671
- the titular Moon Knight doing anything.
- Absolutely.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.799
And that was really exciting,
when we actually had to play with mystery.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.891
<i>I got sent some early drafts</i>
<i>of a couple of the episodes</i>

11:24.058 --> 11:29.063
and I saw that the story had been
transplanted from New York to London,

11:29.146 --> 11:32.566
<i>but the characters were</i>
<i>still written as American.</i>

11:32.650 --> 11:34.276
<i>But that got me thinking,</i>

11:34.360 --> 11:38.656
<i>"Was there space to create</i>
<i>a character that would be a good foil</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:42.201
"for what you expect
from like a mercenary, tough hero?"

11:42.284 --> 11:45.955
"Mercenary?" No, no. I'm not a mercenary.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.082
My name's Steven Grant.

11:48.165 --> 11:52.044
<i>I thought, "Well, since it's being set</i>
<i>in London, what if Steven's English?"</i>

11:52.128 --> 11:55.005
<i>And then I started coming up with</i>
<i>this character around the house</i>

11:55.089 --> 11:56.716
and doing it for my kids.

11:56.799 --> 12:01.303
And my oldest son just really started
falling in love with Steven.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.514
And he would laugh.
So that made me feel like,

12:03.597 --> 12:06.308
"All right, maybe there's something here.
I'm onto something."

12:07.935 --> 12:10.271
I don't know what this
has to do with Egypt.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.606
They didn't have that
back then, did they? No.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.692
They liked figs and dates.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.862
<i>We're standing</i>
<i>in Steven's apartment.</i>

12:17.945 --> 12:19.864
<i>We decided to do an attic,</i>

12:19.947 --> 12:23.909
because it's recalling
a shape of a pyramid.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.370
Two, one. Camera. Action!

12:28.372 --> 12:31.083
<i>We did his bed under a platform</i>

12:31.167 --> 12:34.754
<i>as if he's in a sarcophagus as well.</i>

12:34.837 --> 12:38.340
As if he's, you know,
a little bit tombed in.

12:40.092 --> 12:44.805
<i>When we first started shooting,</i>
<i>the first two months was all Steven.</i>

12:44.930 --> 12:48.350
This process was one of completely
falling in love,

12:48.434 --> 12:49.685
particularly with Steven.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.395
Can you take this downstairs, please?

12:51.479 --> 12:55.691
Will you, please, give me a second,
Donna, with your beetles?

12:56.317 --> 13:00.196
I can't remember the last time that
I just loved being in this character.

13:00.279 --> 13:04.700
<i>So, getting to set, I just wanted to stay</i>
<i>in the accent and stay in character.</i>

13:04.784 --> 13:06.452
So, we get to change in an hour?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.746
-Yeah, yeah, it's in your...
- Yeah. All right.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.206
-Same jacket.
- Great.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.541
<i>I wouldn't describe myself</i>
<i>as method at all.</i>

13:12.833 --> 13:14.502
I just didn't want to be shy about it

13:14.585 --> 13:16.504
and I didn't want to be
second-guessing it.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.672
And so, for me
it was more about just, like,

13:18.756 --> 13:21.550
<i>stay in it so that I can just trust</i>
<i>that it's always there</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:23.427
<i>and I can put my energy onto other things,</i>

13:23.511 --> 13:25.596
<i>like playing the scene</i>
<i>and doing the things</i>

13:25.679 --> 13:27.807
<i>and figuring out the blocking</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

13:29.683 --> 13:31.060
Oh, my God.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.480
<i>For me, the tone of the</i>
<i>show is born entirely out of character.</i>

13:34.563 --> 13:38.609
We're learning about the mythology
of Moon Knight and the stakes of the story

13:39.485 --> 13:43.280
through a character
who is as new to it as we are.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.533
Oh, man! This is mental.

13:45.616 --> 13:49.286
<i>The show is a globe-trotting</i>
<i>adventure with a supernatural bent.</i>

13:49.411 --> 13:51.997
There's also
sprinkles of horror in there.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.834
<i>I think the fun thing about</i> Moon Knight

13:54.917 --> 13:58.337
<i>and I think it's the fun thing</i>
<i>that really echoes throughout the MCU,</i>

13:58.420 --> 14:00.506
<i>ultimately, when you do</i>
<i>peel back those layers,</i>

14:00.589 --> 14:03.133
you realize that it is a character story.

14:03.217 --> 14:07.221
And I do think that is one of the things
that Oscar Isaac gravitated towards.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.516
I'm losing it, man.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.309
I've already lost it.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.564
I just...
I can't tell the difference between my...

14:16.647 --> 14:20.442
My waking life and my dreams, I guess.

14:23.612 --> 14:29.118
Really, the key was Steven,
because Steven is sincere and also funny,

14:29.201 --> 14:33.622
but also 100% sincerely terrified
about what's happening,

14:33.706 --> 14:37.209
<i>that that allows for</i>
<i>a multitude of different reactions</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:39.503
<i>that all still live in the same world.</i>

14:42.256 --> 14:44.466
...to blast you out of my head!

14:52.933 --> 14:54.852
-Yep.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.191
<i>So, while he can be laughing,</i>
<i>or making kind of a joke,</i>

15:01.275 --> 15:05.487
or terrified, you know, of something
really horrible and monstrous,

15:05.571 --> 15:07.197
at the same time,

15:07.281 --> 15:11.660
you can really be dealing with
actual realistic childhood trauma.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.414
And then at the same time,
a talking hippo is with you.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.209
Because it's already been set up
as this psychological point of view,

15:19.293 --> 15:21.211
<i>I think you're able to go with it.</i>

15:23.964 --> 15:25.716
- Hold the door! Thank you.
- Whoa!

15:28.093 --> 15:30.262
OLIVIER SCHNEIDER:
<i>Fight-wise or stunt-wise,</i>

15:30.346 --> 15:32.848
<i>Steven Grant is just a regular guy.</i>

15:33.933 --> 15:35.893
That's the most complicated things to do,

15:35.976 --> 15:38.938
when you have to choreograph a fight
with someone story-wise

15:39.021 --> 15:40.314
who doesn't know how to fight.

15:40.397 --> 15:44.526
<i>I love that because, I think even if you</i>

15:44.735 --> 15:46.445
<i>didn't practice any martial arts,</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:50.449
<i>or you've never been</i>
<i>involved in a fight for real,</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:53.327
<i>you still can have</i>
<i>that instinct to survive.</i>

15:53.410 --> 15:55.829
<i>You still have that instinct</i>
<i>to protect yourself.</i>

15:57.414 --> 15:58.707
Six!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.168
I prefer cricket.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.254
Another idea of Oscar was
to bring a touch of humor.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.924
<i>He could be a little bit goofy sometime,</i>

16:07.007 --> 16:09.593
<i>but sometimes, a fight of being goofy</i>
<i>could save his life.</i>

16:09.677 --> 16:11.220
Jackal. Jackal!

16:25.359 --> 16:27.945
I think Moon Knight costume,
the two characters that we have

16:28.028 --> 16:30.906
are not like anything you saw
in the Marvel universe.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.535
<i>This is something coming from</i>
<i>the imagination of a person</i>

16:34.618 --> 16:36.078
inspired by an old God.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.748
<i>Mr. Knight is what Steven</i>

16:39.832 --> 16:42.001
<i>imagines is cool.</i>

16:42.334 --> 16:44.169
James Bond, something like that, right?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.756
A dapper gentleman that's
a trickster and strong and funny.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.175
Oy, Steven, what the hell are we wearing?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.303
I don't know. She said I needed a suit.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.098
For Mr. Knight,
we have a custom three-piece suit.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.434
We took references from the comic.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.187
<i>We really wanted to make sure</i>
<i>to bring in a little texture</i>

17:02.271 --> 17:04.440
<i>and not have it be flat white.</i>

17:04.523 --> 17:08.235
<i>So when the light hits it,</i>
<i>there's a slight lamé that comes out</i>

17:08.318 --> 17:10.738
<i>to have a little brilliance to the suit.</i>

17:11.363 --> 17:13.949
It has a waistcoat with custom buttons,

17:14.033 --> 17:15.576
the Khonshu symbol.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.997
<i>We adapted a sneaker because I wanted</i>
<i>to give it a modernized look.</i>

17:20.080 --> 17:22.791
Mohamed, our director,
wanted them to have some straps on them

17:22.875 --> 17:24.710
in homage to mummies.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.964
<i>Meghan did such an amazing job.</i>

17:29.089 --> 17:32.259
And yeah, and it just became
this great joke in it,

17:32.342 --> 17:35.679
where he's supposed to do the "suit,"
but doesn't know what that means.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.056
Well, I do look sharp, though.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.558
- All right, where is the scarab?
- Scarab, oh...

17:41.393 --> 17:43.479
What's this?
What are these little poles for?

17:43.562 --> 17:48.150
The truncheons are used
both by Moon Knight and by Mr. Knight.

17:48.233 --> 17:52.112
In the original comic,
they had them housed on the lower leg,

17:52.196 --> 17:55.908
<i>but for our purposes, because we wanted</i>
<i>the size to be a little bit bigger,</i>

17:55.991 --> 17:58.952
we just had them just coming from behind
the back underneath the cape,

17:59.036 --> 18:00.788
or from underneath the jacket.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.081
Pretty cool, actually.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.832
Here's an interesting little tidbit.

18:03.916 --> 18:07.544
Originally, Marc had the Mr. Knight outfit

18:07.628 --> 18:10.047
and Steven had the Moon Knight outfit.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.675
<i>And then as Steven became this</i>
<i>very, you know, English bloke,</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:16.637
it's like, "I feel like
Steven's Mr. Knight. Don't we think that?"

18:16.720 --> 18:19.389
And then they were like,
"We were thinking the same thing."

18:19.473 --> 18:21.016
And so, then that got switched.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.392
All right, time out.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.521
That's it, time out!
Guys, let's all calm down, yeah?

18:25.604 --> 18:26.939
We're all worked up.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.317
Let's all just, like, chill the F out
and talk for a second...

18:31.485 --> 18:34.822
Take the body.
Take the body, take the body, Marc.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.576
<i>Moon Knight</i>
<i>has such an iconic silhouette</i>

18:39.660 --> 18:42.079
<i>that we knew the ballpark</i>
<i>we wanted to stay in.</i>

18:42.162 --> 18:44.289
<i>Cowl, mask, cape.</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:46.125
<i>And then it came down to</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:50.129
what were the subtle cues we wanted
to play with within the wardrobe itself.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.967
I think it makes
a really, really cool drawing,

18:55.050 --> 18:57.261
and for me that is Moon Knight.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.180
<i>But once you actually</i>
<i>put it on a real person,</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:03.058
<i>you start imagining how</i>

19:03.142 --> 19:06.770
an Egyptian God put SWAT team armor
on somebody, you know?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.147
And it feels a little wrong.

19:09.231 --> 19:13.026
The design of it was a process,
a collaborative process.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.444
Everyone chipped in.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.073
<i>Oscar came in and he had</i>
<i>a couple of great ideas about it.</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:21.869
The costume was a big point of
conversation in those early days.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.539
Ultimately, Ryan Meinerding stepped in

19:25.622 --> 19:28.542
and came up with this concept design,

19:29.001 --> 19:33.505
<i>that as soon as it showed up,</i>
<i>everyone looked at it, and we're like,</i>

19:33.589 --> 19:37.134
"I have not seen that
and that's freaking terrifying."

19:38.177 --> 19:42.723
<i>All over Moon Knight's legs,</i>
<i>there are hieroglyphic inscriptions.</i>

19:43.223 --> 19:47.978
Ancient Egyptian language did not have
the word "knight" in it.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.563
<i>It didn't exist.</i>

19:49.646 --> 19:54.026
<i>So I had to come up with</i>
<i>"The Protecting Soldier of the Moon."</i>

19:54.568 --> 19:56.069
Ancient Egyptian Moon Knight.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.158
We worked with Marvel
and their concept artists

20:01.241 --> 20:05.078
and also, obviously Meghan Kasperlik,
who's the costume designer on the show

20:05.162 --> 20:07.414
<i>to kind of take that concept on</i>

20:07.497 --> 20:11.335
and turn this comic book hero
into something real.

20:11.418 --> 20:15.088
<i>Yeah, the gold is lovely.</i>
<i>But, Kieran, can you move your arms okay?</i>

20:15.172 --> 20:17.049
- All good.
-<i>Intrinsically,</i>

20:17.174 --> 20:18.717
it needs to look like wrapped bandages.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.679
And in reality, that makes this
an extremely difficult garment to make.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.723
<i>'Cause obviously, each individual piece</i>

20:24.806 --> 20:27.142
<i>is an individual piece</i>
<i>that's stitched together</i>

20:27.226 --> 20:29.895
<i>and also still has to fit skintight</i>
<i>on the human body.</i>

20:29.978 --> 20:33.065
<i>So we've had to</i>
<i>find fabrics with the right stretch</i>

20:33.148 --> 20:36.735
<i>and then we've printed</i>
<i>the bandage textures onto them</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:38.695
<i>and obviously dyed those fabrics as well.</i>

20:38.779 --> 20:42.741
We're trying to keep it light and cool so
you don't overheat when you're wearing it

20:42.824 --> 20:44.409
and we're trying to keep it stretchy.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.496
At the same time making sure
that the fabrics and everything in it

20:47.579 --> 20:50.624
<i>are robust enough to take falls</i>
<i>and heavy stunt work.</i>

20:53.502 --> 20:55.379
The Moon Knight costume
and how it formed,

20:55.462 --> 20:57.714
it was a long journey
getting something that

20:57.798 --> 20:59.466
I think everyone was feeling good about.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.010
<i>Just because we have seen</i>
<i>so many different transformations</i>

21:02.094 --> 21:05.722
<i>in so many different movies</i>
<i>and superhero projects,</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:08.475
<i>we tried a lot of different things</i>
<i>but wanted to make sure that</i>

21:08.558 --> 21:11.311
<i>it felt like it was</i>
<i>a magical transformation.</i>

21:11.395 --> 21:13.647
But not something
that was coming from too far away,

21:13.730 --> 21:16.984
we wanted it to feel like it was coming
from close to his person.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.070
All right. Do it.
Take control. For now.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.788
<i>So much of it was</i>
<i>real layering of materials</i>

21:29.871 --> 21:32.666
<i>that made this costume feel more real</i>
<i>in the end.</i>

21:32.749 --> 21:34.584
Even though I know it was a lot of work

21:34.668 --> 21:36.962
for the team that put
the actual costume together

21:37.087 --> 21:39.840
<i>and for Meghan and her team</i>
<i>to actually get it done,</i>

21:40.340 --> 21:43.635
<i>having new material</i>
<i>for us to photograph</i>

21:43.719 --> 21:46.013
and to see how it moved was critical.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.903
You can describe Moon Knight
as being almost Marc's id.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.656
Him in his most unleashed,
his most unfeeling,

22:04.740 --> 22:06.742
his most violent, his most vengeful.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.246
-<i>I think we struggled with Marc.</i>
-<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:13.206
<i>We struggled</i>
<i>to find him on the page.</i>

22:13.790 --> 22:15.876
Steven is very easy to digest.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.836
Right away, you fall in love with him

22:17.919 --> 22:20.464
- from the third scene or something.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:20.714 --> 22:25.177
And I was so scared from episode three
that people just don't connect to Marc.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.681
Who is he? He's not as fun,
he's not as sympathetic, he's not.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.727
The first time we ever met Marc on set,
it was like the air came out of the room,

22:33.810 --> 22:35.854
'cause he was in this... Not Oscar,

22:35.937 --> 22:38.440
Marc in the scene
was in this horrible mood.

22:38.690 --> 22:42.402
And so, you know, the whole mood
changed from bubbly, fun Steven

22:42.486 --> 22:44.738
to "All right, time to focus, everybody."

22:47.908 --> 22:50.285
<i>At first I was unsure,</i>
<i>and so I said,</i>

22:50.369 --> 22:53.413
"I don't wanna film any Marc things
on the same day as Steven.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.166
Can we figure it out
so we can do 'em on different days,

22:56.249 --> 22:57.959
so I can keep them really distinct?"

22:58.043 --> 23:01.088
Okay, here we go.
Stand by. And action!

23:01.171 --> 23:04.091
I didn't do that.
I am protecting her from Khonshu.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.134
You don't know what you're talking about.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.304
He's got his eyes on her. He wants her
as my replacement. I'm never...

23:09.388 --> 23:11.431
You don't know what
you're talking about, Steven.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.516
Just shut up.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.685
And, by the way, Marc isn't
Oscar's regular voice, either.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.897
You know, that's a completely
invented accent.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.525
Listen to me, buddy. Hey, listen to me.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.943
Get away from that bag.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.570
Get away from that bag.
You're gonna get her killed.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.448
Giving Marc a bit of a Chicago thing
going on

23:28.532 --> 23:31.493
and then really delving into
the lore of the comics,

23:31.576 --> 23:37.499
and giving him a lower register of voice,
a different way of standing

23:37.624 --> 23:42.754
<i>and finding the physicality</i>
<i>to make them very, very, distinct.</i>

23:46.425 --> 23:47.467
Cut!

23:47.551 --> 23:48.677
<i>I started to find,</i>

23:48.760 --> 23:53.181
<i>as I got more comfortable with</i>
<i>these two different people,</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:55.308
I started to develop the muscle

23:55.392 --> 23:58.270
to be able to transition
between the two easier.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.814
And then, as it went on,

24:00.897 --> 24:03.233
<i>that started to feel like</i>
<i>the real magic trick.</i>

24:03.859 --> 24:07.028
For the timing,
do you want me to say the lines of Steven?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.197
So you know
how long to stay on the reflection for?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.365
Beautiful, yeah.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.535
<i>There's a scene on the cliff,</i>

24:13.618 --> 24:17.330
Marc talks to Steven and then we go back
to Oscar like three, four times.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.041
What the hell's wrong with you, Steven?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.794
Me? You're the one
going on a killing spree.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.463
What he did was magical.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.381
I'm just changing the camera

24:26.465 --> 24:28.758
and he's changing as a human being,
from Marc to Steven.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.845
<i>And Marc and Steven are completely</i>
<i>different and it's not easy for Oscar.</i>

24:31.928 --> 24:34.806
I suggest you stop listening
to that stupid pigeon.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.141
Stay out of my way.

24:36.224 --> 24:39.352
By the end, it was really fun
because you could just see,

24:39.436 --> 24:41.980
in just the eyes,
you could see when there was a shift.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.149
You didn't even have to change,
you could see,

24:44.232 --> 24:46.151
"Oh, there's Marc. Marc's here,"

24:46.234 --> 24:49.029
<i>and that was really exciting.</i>

24:51.031 --> 24:53.366
<i>I can look at a still photo of him</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:56.244
and know if he's playing Steven or Marc.
Nothing different.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.498
It's just he holds himself differently.
Immediately.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.417
When we think back on it,
we spent time with

25:02.501 --> 25:05.587
three people in the same body
over that time period of shooting.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.965
We all got to know Oscar
and then we all got to know Steven

25:09.049 --> 25:11.259
- and then we all got to know Marc.
- Yeah.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.889
<i>When you have an amazing hero,</i>

25:15.972 --> 25:18.433
<i>when you set the bar that high</i>
<i>with an Oscar Isaac,</i>

25:18.517 --> 25:21.978
<i>you then go, "Okay, what do we do</i>
<i>with the villain?"</i>

25:22.062 --> 25:24.397
<i>The fact that Ethan Hawke</i>
<i>came into the mix,</i>

25:24.481 --> 25:26.107
<i>those are two dream castings.</i>

25:26.191 --> 25:30.070
Very different than
the discoveries that we've made, right?

25:30.153 --> 25:32.781
<i>Those are two very big,</i>
<i>very established stars</i>

25:32.864 --> 25:34.824
<i>that we are very lucky to have</i>

25:34.908 --> 25:37.619
<i>come into our world</i>
<i>and inhabit these characters.</i>

25:37.702 --> 25:38.995
<i>She was betrayed.</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:42.249
-Was she?
-By indolent fellow Gods.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.416
Oh.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.793
By even her own Avatar.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.088
The Avatars, too?
Blue people, right? Love that film.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.382
- By avatar, what I mean...
- You mean the anime?

25:50.465 --> 25:52.759
Steven. Stop it. Stop it.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.804
I had seen some of Mohamed Diab's movies

25:55.887 --> 25:59.307
and we were talking about making
a little indie sci-fi movie.

25:59.516 --> 26:03.562
We were, like, about to start
and we got this job and I asked him,

26:03.645 --> 26:05.564
"Can you wait for a year?"
And he said yes.

26:05.647 --> 26:09.317
And it was just like we clicked, and we
felt like we wanna do something together.

26:09.484 --> 26:11.444
I had been watching <i>Good Lord Bird</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:13.989
and it was just, like,
a staggering performance.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.074
<i>As Mohamed and I were talking</i>
<i>about Harrow,</i>

26:16.157 --> 26:19.536
<i>I said, "Hey, man, you know, what about</i>
<i>Ethan? Wouldn't Ethan be great?"</i>

26:19.619 --> 26:21.913
Mohamed said,
"Yes, I love Ethan. I know Ethan.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.083
"I think that'd be so good. That's such
a great idea, we should do that."

26:25.166 --> 26:27.877
<i>I think it was the very next day,</i>
<i>I went down to my coffee shop</i>

26:27.961 --> 26:29.004
<i>and there Ethan was.</i>

26:29.087 --> 26:31.923
<i>And I had seen him around,</i>
<i>but I never had talked to him.</i>

26:32.007 --> 26:34.926
And he's like, "Hey, I heard
you talked to Mohamed the other day."

26:35.010 --> 26:38.388
He goes, "I'm playing the Moon Knight."
And I was like, "I didn't know that."

26:38.471 --> 26:41.516
<i>And he's "You should be the villain.</i>
<i>Mohamed and I talked about it."</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:43.351
It was a very easy yes.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.437
I mean, I never even
thought twice about it.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.908
<i>What's so interesting</i>
<i>about the comics</i>

26:58.992 --> 27:00.910
<i>is they don't have a defining villain.</i>

27:00.994 --> 27:03.747
And that allowed us to try to really,

27:03.830 --> 27:06.416
what aspects of some of the villains
do we want to keep.

27:06.833 --> 27:10.795
<i>What aspects really help the origin story?</i>

27:11.546 --> 27:16.676
You know, what I believe he started out as
was a shady billionaire, sort of.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.262
- Something like that, right?
- Yes, that's how it started.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.848
And then changing him to
essentially a cult leader.

27:21.931 --> 27:27.479
But we talked a lot with Ethan
about how to make that real because,

27:27.562 --> 27:32.776
you know, his zealousness and his belief
is for a world without pain.

27:33.068 --> 27:37.113
And that's, for us, you know, a much more
interesting character than someone

27:37.197 --> 27:39.532
that just has maliciousness at heart,
you know?

27:39.616 --> 27:43.453
The idea in episode six when he goes
to Ammit and tell her, "Take my life."

27:43.536 --> 27:47.499
He's not one of those villains who are
actually trying to get their ways because

27:47.582 --> 27:49.793
"I wanna control the world."
He doesn't care.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.795
Your Scales lack balance.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.757
I accept the Scales
regardless of the outcome.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.470
<i>Most people who commit</i>
<i>terrible crimes don't think...</i>

28:00.553 --> 28:03.056
They wake up in the morning and go,
"I'm a bad guy."

28:03.139 --> 28:06.017
They have their reasons.
Hell is paved with their reasons.

28:06.101 --> 28:11.856
And so, I had to come up with his reasons
and make them as rational and sane

28:11.940 --> 28:13.400
and compelling as possible.

28:14.901 --> 28:18.405
<i>When you think about</i>
<i>cult leaders throughout history,</i>

28:18.530 --> 28:20.782
<i>megalomaniacs,</i>

28:20.865 --> 28:26.079
<i>they very often,</i>
<i>at least start out extremely idealistic.</i>

28:26.162 --> 28:29.999
<i>You see real, moral aspirations</i>
<i>in a lot of these people.</i>

28:30.083 --> 28:34.754
And so I tried to tap into
what he believes, and that if...

28:34.838 --> 28:36.923
You have to believe that
you're really helping.

28:37.424 --> 28:41.886
We are here to make the Earth
as much like Heaven as possible.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.681
Who'd like to go first?

28:45.390 --> 28:48.977
I think that most successful villains
in the history of Marvel

28:49.060 --> 28:52.897
are the couple of villains
that actually have some gray in them,

28:52.981 --> 28:54.649
like Killmonger or Thanos.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.318
People actually thought, "You know what?
You have a point."

28:57.402 --> 29:01.698
And I hope Harrow is... People are gonna
feel that about him. He has a logic.

29:01.781 --> 29:04.159
Yeah, there's a logic.
And then there is also...

29:04.242 --> 29:07.412
It's very clear
that this guy comes from a lot of pain.

29:07.495 --> 29:12.000
Comes from a lot of pain, and that he has
a humanity to him via that pain.

29:13.543 --> 29:17.172
We got the pleasure of being able to
direct the opening scene of episode one

29:17.380 --> 29:19.883
- that originally was to open episode two.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

29:19.966 --> 29:22.761
<i>We wish we could take</i>
<i>credit for it, but we can't.</i>

29:22.844 --> 29:24.721
<i>We have to lay it at the feet</i>
<i>of Ethan Hawke.</i>

29:24.804 --> 29:28.391
<i>He came up with this idea</i>
<i>that was a brilliant introduction scene.</i>

29:28.475 --> 29:30.477
<i>That's why you hire Ethan Hawke.</i>

29:30.560 --> 29:33.688
You just watched somebody put glass
in their shoe and walk away with a cane.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.524
<i>And then, you know, scenes later,</i>

29:36.608 --> 29:39.569
<i>this guy comes crunching down the road.</i>

29:39.652 --> 29:41.154
<i>And you already know who he is,</i>

29:41.237 --> 29:43.698
<i>you already know that</i>
<i>this guy's pretty messed up.</i>

29:43.782 --> 29:48.870
<i>And it just creates so much mystery</i>
<i>and interest in who this person is,</i>

29:48.953 --> 29:50.914
<i>and that was all him.</i>

29:50.997 --> 29:56.544
The idea of that cold open, we took it
and we played with it in the table reads.

29:56.628 --> 30:00.465
I think it was Grant who said
we should pay off the shoes,

30:00.548 --> 30:02.717
- it shouldn't just be an oddity.
-Smart.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.053
<i>Anything that is planted,</i>
<i>it has to have repercussions,</i>

30:05.136 --> 30:06.679
<i>that domino effect of everything.</i>

30:06.763 --> 30:09.516
<i>And a lot of things just, like, got born</i>

30:09.599 --> 30:11.810
- <i>through those table reads.</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

30:13.311 --> 30:14.896
Hey, you see that, don't you?

30:16.147 --> 30:19.025
Oh, yeah, I see it. I see it.

30:19.108 --> 30:22.737
<i>Grant Curtis, our producer,</i>
<i>I give him so much credit for this too</i>

30:22.821 --> 30:26.074
<i>and Kevin and everybody at Marvel,</i>
<i>that they gave us the space to do this.</i>

30:26.157 --> 30:29.744
We would have weekly table reads
of the episodes

30:29.828 --> 30:31.746
and just ask tons of questions

30:31.830 --> 30:33.832
and get in there like mechanics,
you know?

30:34.082 --> 30:38.753
It evolved into something that was
way more deeply philosophical.

30:39.170 --> 30:44.467
It became super collaborative with Marvel
and the performers and you guys,

30:44.551 --> 30:49.305
where we ended up kind of re-understanding
the character just from a character level.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.016
We created, I think, an environment

30:52.100 --> 30:54.644
that allowed people to
speak their mind narratively,

30:54.727 --> 30:56.229
there was never judgment.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.314
Just, "Yeah, what's best for my character?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.859
"I'm throwing this out there,
bounce ideas back and forth."

31:00.942 --> 31:04.529
And it made our scripts and our stories
and our series much better.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.948
<i>When on set,</i>
<i>it was how do we make this work?</i>

31:07.031 --> 31:09.117
<i>How do we make this</i>
<i>the most honest it can be?</i>

31:09.200 --> 31:12.287
<i>And we were all on the same page and so,</i>

31:12.370 --> 31:16.291
<i>that's why I think it feels seamless</i>
<i>with Aaron and Justin, with Mohamed,</i>

31:16.374 --> 31:18.585
'cause we were all talking about
all those things.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.753
I mean, it was all out there in the open.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.840
<i>May was on the table with us.</i>

31:24.340 --> 31:27.719
- She was a strong fighter for Layla.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.264
Layla wouldn't have been
the way she was without May.

31:31.347 --> 31:32.724
- Without a doubt.
- Uh,

31:32.807 --> 31:34.767
she was like between her and Sarah

31:34.851 --> 31:38.062
being the female voices in the room,
I think the two of them

31:38.146 --> 31:40.732
and Egyptians knowing who she is,

31:40.857 --> 31:43.192
<i>the struggles that she had to go through.</i>

31:43.276 --> 31:44.444
<i>Casting Layla wasn't easy</i>

31:44.527 --> 31:47.363
<i>because I knew from the beginning</i>
<i>that it's not just a role,</i>

31:47.488 --> 31:51.534
it represents a whole group of people,
around the world.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.120
<i>I love May as an actress,</i>

31:54.203 --> 31:55.830
<i>but it was very important for me</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:58.750
as an Arab to find someone
who can represent us.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.586
- So no one's gonna be here?
- Yeah, you wanna just be giving...

32:01.669 --> 32:04.756
I didn't really know anything
about the role before I took it on.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.216
She was Egyptian and that for me

32:07.300 --> 32:11.220
<i>was a very exciting thing to portray</i>
<i>in a Marvel production.</i>

32:11.512 --> 32:14.849
<i>And then as time went by and I started</i>
<i>to figure out more about her</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:17.393
and I found out her, like,
trajectory and journey,

32:17.477 --> 32:19.228
that became even more exciting.

32:21.105 --> 32:25.485
Mohamed went for actors that I think
he just intuitively know commit,

32:25.777 --> 32:29.322
just commit fully
and are not afraid to look silly doing it

32:29.489 --> 32:31.658
<i>or, you know, whatever it takes.</i>

32:31.991 --> 32:36.871
<i>At every turn, she was completely game</i>
<i>and also had wonderful ideas</i>

32:37.038 --> 32:39.749
about this character
and about giving her a real voice.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.043
Just so you know,
I'm not here to help you.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.214
I'm here for me and for everyone else
who would die if Harrow succeeds.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.966
I struggled a lot in the beginning.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.926
As like quite a vulnerable person,

32:50.009 --> 32:54.097
I had this idea of, like,
Layla has to be really strong

32:54.180 --> 32:57.392
<i>and she doesn't have feelings</i>
<i>and I would get really insecure</i>

32:57.475 --> 33:01.437
<i>when I'd, like, crack or cry</i>
<i>or feel a bit emotional.</i>

33:01.771 --> 33:04.607
But this is just kind of a real person

33:04.732 --> 33:08.152
and it was important for me
to show all those sides of a woman.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.780
Every time I learn something new
about you,

33:10.863 --> 33:16.494
I think, "That's it. There can't possibly
be any secrets left between us."

33:16.953 --> 33:21.374
And then something else pops up,
and it's like I've not known you at all.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.835
Yeah, you haven't.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.295
You don't.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.841
<i>I loved doing episode four</i>

33:29.966 --> 33:32.260
<i>because I feel like Layla</i>
<i>got a lot of space</i>

33:32.343 --> 33:35.555
<i>for us to see what she's going through,</i>
<i>like, internally</i>

33:35.638 --> 33:39.058
<i>sort of be manifested</i>
<i>through the experience in the tomb.</i>

33:40.351 --> 33:43.730
The scene with Harrow
felt like a play on the day

33:43.813 --> 33:47.358
because we were so spread apart
that there were two cranes filming us.

33:47.442 --> 33:51.529
<i>We did all of our close ups at the</i>
<i>same time, which was really incredible.</i>

33:51.738 --> 33:53.573
You handled that beautifully.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.951
Why do all men like you

33:58.494 --> 34:03.916
feel it necessary to be
so condescending?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.669
It was really important
for me to have Layla

34:06.753 --> 34:09.797
not just to be, like,
serving a man's journey.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.007
Are you done?

34:11.090 --> 34:13.468
Whether it's her father
or her lover or whatnot,

34:13.551 --> 34:17.597
I feel like she's discovering herself,
which is the biggest thing.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.516
I do hope you find closure.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.194
<i>So this is our Cairo set.</i>

34:31.944 --> 34:33.488
<i>It's a very big day for us.</i>

34:33.613 --> 34:35.740
We have 255 extras working.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.534
There's 55 picture cars
circling through there,

34:38.618 --> 34:41.329
<i>along with Oscar and May walking</i>
<i>through the streets of Cairo.</i>

34:42.288 --> 34:43.956
-And action!

34:45.750 --> 34:48.920
<i>When I got on the Cairo streets,</i>
<i>I was so overwhelmed.</i>

34:49.045 --> 34:51.255
I had actual anxiety, which is...

34:51.380 --> 34:55.802
I feel that there sometimes
just because there's so much going on.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.764
<i>One of the most</i>
<i>interesting things was</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:03.309
creating downtown Cairo in Budapest.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.437
TREVOR WATERSON:
<i>We built a big backlot area</i>

35:06.562 --> 35:08.731
that's about four or five blocks of Cairo

35:08.815 --> 35:11.818
with the green screen behind
which will be the pyramid.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.948
Mohamed wanted to make sure
that if we weren't going to film in Egypt,

35:17.115 --> 35:20.618
we were going to have Egypt
replicated to a T.

35:21.828 --> 35:24.372
I'll tell you something
that pisses people in Egypt.

35:24.455 --> 35:27.041
The pyramids, it's always
in the middle of the desert.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.709
It has a side that is
in the desert,

35:28.793 --> 35:30.962
and the other side
is in the center of the city.

35:31.587 --> 35:34.841
<i>So it was very important for me</i>
<i>to portray Egypt</i>

35:36.050 --> 35:37.051
as real Egypt.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.888
We brought Egypt to Budapest.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.475
Basically reconstructed Cairo here.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.688
<i>Cairo neighborhood down to,</i>
<i>you know, the license plates</i>

35:49.021 --> 35:51.941
<i>and just even the T-shirts</i>
<i>and everything in Arabic.</i>

35:52.066 --> 35:54.777
And really, it brought me back
to being in Cairo.

35:54.861 --> 35:55.945
<i>It was really impressive.</i>

35:57.530 --> 35:58.781
Everything, all right.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.535
<i>I had tons of Egyptians, extras.</i>

36:03.161 --> 36:04.370
<i>And some of them told me,</i>

36:04.453 --> 36:07.373
I haven't visited Egypt in five years,
and I finally feel home.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.500
And they were just
very emotional about it.

36:11.294 --> 36:14.755
<i>Moon Knight</i> is a gigantic production.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.008
Probably the biggest production
we've done so far,

36:17.091 --> 36:19.886
<i>as far as just the overall scope</i>
<i>and size of the show.</i>

36:19.969 --> 36:23.681
<i>We needed to go to a place that we could</i>
<i>get as many stages as we need.</i>

36:23.806 --> 36:25.892
<i>Get as much backlot space as we need.</i>

36:25.975 --> 36:28.311
<i>I knew that we would be able</i>
<i>to pull off practically</i>

36:28.394 --> 36:30.188
<i>what we needed to pull off in Budapest.</i>

36:32.023 --> 36:36.319
<i>We completely fell in love</i>
<i>with our production designer Stefania.</i>

36:36.569 --> 36:39.822
She's a character and a great person
and a hard worker,

36:39.906 --> 36:41.741
but also just a genius, right?

36:41.824 --> 36:45.244
I remember the day
she showed us that museum.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.623
- Mmm-hmm.
- I was blown away like everyone.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.877
It's a replica of everything Egyptian
I've ever seen in my life. It's, it's...

36:53.252 --> 36:55.546
<i>She and her team, everyone, geniuses.</i>

36:58.925 --> 37:02.970
<i>We are in the</i>
<i>Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.</i>

37:04.055 --> 37:06.974
<i>And we are recreating</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:10.019
what is supposed to be the
equivalent of the British Museum.

37:10.102 --> 37:13.314
Egyptian part of the British Museum
in London,

37:13.606 --> 37:17.902
<i>with three big rooms</i>
<i>that we're dressing with our artifacts.</i>

37:19.654 --> 37:23.574
<i>We made something like 140 pieces,</i>

37:23.741 --> 37:28.079
<i>from the biggest one,</i>
<i>which is six meter and something high</i>

37:28.162 --> 37:31.582
<i>to the smallest items</i>
<i>that have been sculpted and designed</i>

37:31.666 --> 37:33.209
<i>and then recreated, yes.</i>

37:33.417 --> 37:35.544
<i>Like jewels and small,</i>
<i>small, small pieces.</i>

37:36.462 --> 37:42.802
Because most of our story is
the duplicity of Steven and Marc,

37:43.177 --> 37:48.099
<i>those enclosed glass display</i>
<i>they were giving us,</i>

37:48.182 --> 37:51.894
<i>you know, the playground</i>
<i>of reflection that we needed.</i>

37:59.443 --> 38:00.820
I can't believe it.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.240
Oh, my days. We're inside.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.243
We're inside the great pyramid of Giza.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.207
This is our biggest set.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.585
Probably. One of our biggest sets,
if not the biggest.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.630
<i>We're inside the pyramids of Giza,</i>

38:20.006 --> 38:21.966
<i>and this is where the Avatars meet.</i>

38:22.091 --> 38:24.844
So it's a very essential place
to the story.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.762
A lot of our story takes place there.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.849
A lot of everything kind of
comes together there in that set.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.851
<i>So it was important for us to build that.</i>

38:31.934 --> 38:34.812
<i>What we built practically</i>
<i>was about three stories,</i>

38:34.895 --> 38:36.981
<i>as high as we could build onto the stage.</i>

38:39.066 --> 38:42.236
We are on stage six at the Origo,

38:42.320 --> 38:45.990
and this is the set that we call
the Chambers of the Gods.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.827
Here we are. Shooting tomorrow.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.247
<i>It's kind of scary because I've never done</i>
<i>anything like this.</i>

38:53.331 --> 38:57.501
<i>You know, it's very difficult to do Egypt</i>

38:57.626 --> 39:03.841
<i>because I think</i>
<i>it's so easy to become cliché.</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:06.969
You know, Vegas type of a thing.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.555
<i>I had two Egyptologists.</i>

39:09.805 --> 39:13.351
<i>One from here, one in LA,</i>
<i>and a researcher.</i>

39:13.642 --> 39:15.353
You know, we can take license,

39:15.603 --> 39:21.609
<i>and obviously we did take license,</i>
<i>but in a respectful way, I think.</i>

39:24.612 --> 39:30.284
I wanted to mix the Gods
that are the Marvel characters

39:30.785 --> 39:33.287
with the original Gods statues.

39:36.457 --> 39:41.420
You know, the idea was that every portal
is where the Avatars come in.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.672
The disturbance.

39:44.965 --> 39:48.803
Egyptian Gods are very tall in scale,

39:48.928 --> 39:54.642
<i>and we didn't want to have</i>
<i>just feet and knees on camera.</i>

39:54.725 --> 40:00.773
<i>So we brought down the faces</i>
<i>and the representative animal</i>

40:00.856 --> 40:03.818
<i>on ground level in the temple</i>

40:03.901 --> 40:08.197
to have a more interesting interaction.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.825
We will decide our best course of action.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.910
Speak your purpose.

40:14.036 --> 40:15.788
<i>The detail that was there</i>

40:15.871 --> 40:18.582
<i>and the sculptures</i>
<i>that we had in the Hall of Gods</i>

40:18.707 --> 40:20.334
<i>was amazing craftsmanship.</i>

40:20.543 --> 40:21.836
We had a whole stone shop

40:21.919 --> 40:24.046
of people that were just there
building statues.

40:24.130 --> 40:27.633
<i>That's all they did all day long</i>
<i>was mold and form and carve statues.</i>

40:29.552 --> 40:32.513
<i>The Alexander the Great set,</i>
<i>the amount of detail...</i>

40:32.638 --> 40:36.016
There is no motivating reason
to go in and take a closeup of it.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.186
But if you did,
everywhere you looked in this chamber,

40:39.311 --> 40:41.480
it looks so authentic. It's so detailed.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.357
<i>Every little painting on the wall.</i>

40:43.899 --> 40:47.486
<i>We are in Alexander's</i>
<i>burial chamber.</i>

40:49.321 --> 40:52.324
This was one of everybody's
most favorite set.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.287
<i>We have some of Alexander's treasure.</i>

40:57.288 --> 40:58.497
His famous horse.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.958
<i>His personal shield.</i>

41:01.917 --> 41:06.797
<i>One of the challenging parts was</i>
<i>to paint it in a way that was accurate,</i>

41:07.423 --> 41:10.843
not by just one painter,
but by multiple people,

41:10.926 --> 41:12.470
<i>which would have happened.</i>

41:13.387 --> 41:17.808
<i>We contacted an art school in Budapest,</i>

41:18.100 --> 41:21.562
where they have fantastic young artists.

41:22.062 --> 41:27.234
<i>We put out several projectors</i>
<i>with the layout of the hieroglyphs,</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:30.154
<i>and they basically came and they painted.</i>

41:30.237 --> 41:32.448
<i>So it was a fantastic experience for us,</i>

41:32.573 --> 41:34.617
<i>because for me seeing</i>

41:34.909 --> 41:38.579
younger people involved
in something so different

41:38.662 --> 41:41.123
<i>from what they do was...</i>

41:41.207 --> 41:42.666
<i>They were very enthusiastic,</i>

41:42.750 --> 41:48.422
and I think ultimately it's priceless
what they gave us.

41:49.673 --> 41:53.511
<i>What Stefania did with these sets</i>
<i>as the production designer</i>

41:53.594 --> 41:55.221
<i>is just so important.</i>

41:55.763 --> 41:57.556
<i>For me, it's not because,</i>

41:57.640 --> 42:00.768
oh, I can feel like I'm really there,
you know. It's because...

42:01.685 --> 42:04.855
I see an artist bring their top game.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.609
I see them come in and, like,
make huge choices about the story.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.737
There's like little Easter eggs
that connect to other episodes.

42:11.820 --> 42:16.242
There's, like... Amazing thought
has gone into creating these sets.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.411
So it's like,
this person is committing fully

42:19.495 --> 42:21.580
and bringing everything they have
to the table.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.665
I wanna do that, too.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.338
<i>I hope that part of the joy</i>
<i>of watching this show will be</i>

42:29.421 --> 42:31.840
exposure to this amazing
Egyptian mythology

42:31.924 --> 42:33.634
that a lot of people don't have.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.722
<i>We dealt with classic</i>
<i>Joseph Campbell myths</i>

42:38.806 --> 42:39.974
for years in the West.

42:40.057 --> 42:45.980
We saw a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby
adapted version of Norse myths, of course.

42:46.063 --> 42:50.442
And now really tapping into
the mythology of ancient Egypt,

42:50.526 --> 42:56.532
<i>which is so formative for humanity itself</i>
<i>and for storytelling in general.</i>

42:56.740 --> 42:58.742
Egyptian mythology is one of the oldest

42:58.826 --> 43:01.036
and the most fascinating ones
in the world.

43:01.704 --> 43:04.957
<i>I think Hollywood has been</i>
<i>reluctant to approach it.</i>

43:05.165 --> 43:07.876
I was lucky that I was given
the chance to show that.

43:08.043 --> 43:11.714
And I was lucky that the elements
of the story had that from the get-go.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.507
We had a great team.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.342
We had the Egyptologists.

43:15.467 --> 43:19.805
We had Ramy Romany with us
making sure that everything is correct.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.265
Let's start with...

43:21.348 --> 43:24.685
<i>Marvel was very keen on</i>
<i>trying to make</i> Moon Knight

43:24.852 --> 43:29.398
as historically accurate as possible
for a fictional show.

43:29.815 --> 43:33.277
<i>They were trying to thread that needle</i>
<i>between historical accuracy</i>

43:33.444 --> 43:35.821
<i>and comic book accuracy.</i>

43:37.489 --> 43:42.202
The idea of an Avatar
is an ancient Egyptian idea.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.956
<i>Every pharaoh is believed</i>
<i>to be the God Horus.</i>

43:46.040 --> 43:48.459
<i>So every ancient Egyptian pharaoh</i>

43:48.751 --> 43:51.170
is actually the Avatar of God Horus.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.681
Binding the gods into a stone.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.684
Now that's fiction.
That didn't happen.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.603
<i>But ushabtis are true.</i>

44:07.811 --> 44:11.398
<i>Every time you go in any royal tomb,</i>
<i>there are ushabtis</i>

44:11.565 --> 44:15.361
<i>that would help the deceased,</i>
<i>the king or nobleman,</i>

44:15.569 --> 44:17.529
<i>into his journey of the afterlife.</i>

44:17.738 --> 44:20.032
Those ushabtis come to life,

44:20.407 --> 44:22.493
<i>and they serve the king in the afterlife.</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:27.373
<i>Filming in Budapest,</i>
<i>there's a museum,</i>

44:27.456 --> 44:29.750
<i>and it's got</i>
<i>an ancient Egyptian collection.</i>

44:29.917 --> 44:34.546
And there's a little cabinet,
of Taweret ushabtis

44:34.630 --> 44:36.548
and there's a Taweret necklace.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.258
<i>And that was really special.</i>

44:38.342 --> 44:42.262
<i>It kind of brings home that it's not just</i>
<i>a make-believe character</i>

44:42.388 --> 44:46.475
<i>that we're bringing for the series,</i>
<i>but it has a long history.</i>

44:46.725 --> 44:48.602
Also being half Egyptian myself,

44:48.686 --> 44:53.190
it's great that I get to play
this ancient Egyptian mythical character.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.115
Anything else?

45:01.198 --> 45:04.451
-That's it. Let's cut.
-Amazing. Yeah, let's cut it.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.203
<i>Antonia is</i>
<i>another fellow Egyptian...</i>

45:06.286 --> 45:07.287
Thanks, guys.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.916
...who the moment everyone heard her,
this is Taweret.

45:11.208 --> 45:15.170
By the way, today I learned Taweret,
without the R.

45:15.462 --> 45:17.464
- Whoa!
- Taweret. Taweret.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.882
I'm just gonna have you say it.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.510
I'm saying it and I hope I'm saying it
in the right way.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.304
We're all learning.
It's a language that is not spoken.

45:24.638 --> 45:26.432
- So we're all learning it.
- Right, right.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.476
But she is the character,
I think, like...

45:30.185 --> 45:31.311
they moved the character

45:31.395 --> 45:34.273
and created the character
visually around her performance.

45:34.356 --> 45:37.568
I remember the VFX team
showing us early motion capture.

45:37.651 --> 45:40.738
- Yeah.
- They show us her little test

45:40.863 --> 45:43.907
and then they show the exact mannerisms

45:44.032 --> 45:46.618
being doubled by a giant hippo.
It was hilarious.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.245
This will really bake your noodle,

45:48.328 --> 45:50.956
but I think you were just taking
a little time-out.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.876
I'm afraid you're actually quite dead.

45:53.959 --> 45:57.504
We talked about actually having
a real costume for Khonshu,

45:57.588 --> 45:59.298
a real costume for Taweret,

45:59.381 --> 46:01.175
<i>a real costume for Ammit.</i>

46:01.300 --> 46:03.886
<i>Again, I don't like telling</i>
<i>a visual effects vendor,</i>

46:04.011 --> 46:06.221
just make it look real,
make it look like real cloth.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.890
I'd much rather be able to say,

46:08.015 --> 46:12.186
match the way that the light reflects off
of Antonia's shoulder,

46:12.269 --> 46:15.189
<i>or match the way</i>
<i>the beads look on our Ammit dress.</i>

46:15.272 --> 46:17.149
<i>And then, yeah, having a performance.</i>

46:17.232 --> 46:19.026
I mean, having that for real

46:19.109 --> 46:21.653
was was one of the things
that I really pushed for.

46:22.362 --> 46:26.575
Welcome, gentle traveler... Travelers,

46:26.658 --> 46:28.827
to the realm of the Duat.

46:29.244 --> 46:31.413
I think they're using
really new technology

46:32.039 --> 46:36.251
where I am not burdened by this kind
of motion capture suit anymore.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.004
<i>I'm only wearing my costume.</i>

46:39.505 --> 46:43.091
And then we have the stick,
where basically there's an eyeline

46:43.175 --> 46:47.429
for the nine-foot-tall version of Khonshu,
which will be placed in later.

46:47.638 --> 46:51.809
We had a full-scale Khonshu skull
that we had manufactured.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.977
<i>So we'd have reference</i>
<i>of Khonshu's head.</i>

46:54.061 --> 46:56.939
<i>We'd have great reference</i>
<i>of Khonshu's performance,</i>

46:57.022 --> 46:58.816
<i>'cause we could see</i>
<i>how he was moving around</i>

46:58.899 --> 47:00.859
<i>and we'd have a costume for reference.</i>

47:00.943 --> 47:04.112
So then we would recreate that
as a digital character

47:04.196 --> 47:06.240
and you get clean plates
and all kind of stuff.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.450
<i>But it was really helpful to have that.</i>

47:10.035 --> 47:12.454
Give it back, you fool.

47:14.790 --> 47:18.836
Being Egyptian and being somebody
who's very interested in ancient Egypt,

47:18.961 --> 47:22.673
<i>I find that Marvel is taking a bit</i>
<i>of creative license with Khonshu.</i>

47:22.756 --> 47:26.927
<i>But they're also staying true to, I think,</i>
<i>the spirit of the mythology.</i>

47:27.302 --> 47:31.265
You know, <i>khonshu</i> means "traveler"
in ancient Egyptian,

47:31.348 --> 47:34.059
and he's the protector
of the travelers of the night.

47:34.142 --> 47:38.480
<i>He's the moon God, and he's there to keep</i>
<i>the balance in the universe.</i>

47:38.605 --> 47:42.192
Do you swear to protect
the travelers of the night

47:43.110 --> 47:47.573
and bring my vengeance to those
who would do them harm?

47:48.073 --> 47:50.325
<i>There's that literal side</i>
<i>of Khonshu,</i>

47:50.701 --> 47:53.287
and then there is the metaphor

47:53.412 --> 47:58.208
which is the embodiment of Marc's rage.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.376
Kill him!

48:00.252 --> 48:03.881
His rage at what has happened
to him as a child...

48:04.047 --> 48:05.173
Break his windpipe!

48:05.424 --> 48:07.134
<i>...and his rage at himself</i>

48:07.301 --> 48:09.636
that feels that he deserves it
in some way.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.723
And that he has to be a slave to,
that he has no choice.

48:12.806 --> 48:14.266
You know, almost like an addiction.

48:14.808 --> 48:19.563
You think you own
this body?

48:21.815 --> 48:24.443
It belongs to me.

48:24.693 --> 48:25.903
<i>The other thing is like,</i>

48:25.986 --> 48:28.113
is Khonshu just another voice in his head?

48:28.280 --> 48:30.991
And these are questions
that aren't answered readily.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.918
<i>Every aspect of this show</i>
<i>has a duality.</i>

48:41.835 --> 48:47.215
<i>Every person has a dual self,</i>
<i>and the story has a dual nature.</i>

48:49.259 --> 48:52.930
<i>Khonshu has this Avatar</i>
<i>whose job is to avenge wrongdoing.</i>

48:53.013 --> 48:55.599
<i>And then I am working for a different God</i>

48:55.724 --> 48:59.186
<i>whose goal is to eliminate all wrongdoing.</i>

49:00.520 --> 49:03.690
<i>I could make a very compelling case</i>
<i>that I'm not playing the villain.</i>

49:03.774 --> 49:08.612
<i>It's possible to watch this show</i>
<i>and think that this human being</i>

49:08.779 --> 49:12.324
has created these visions
of his psychiatrist

49:12.407 --> 49:14.660
who's trying to "aleve" his pain.

49:14.743 --> 49:18.288
And he wants his pain
because his pain gives him his identity.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.918
Because a lot of us
store our identity in our hurts, right?

49:23.210 --> 49:25.796
<i>And so he's turned me into a villain.</i>

49:27.464 --> 49:32.302
<i>And so I've tried to create a character</i>

49:32.386 --> 49:35.722
that could be seen
from either side of the coin.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.391
I liked the villain.

49:38.642 --> 49:44.564
His "No tree may ascend to
the light of heaven if it doesn't descend

49:44.648 --> 49:46.942
"to the darkness of hell".

49:48.235 --> 49:49.611
I actually believe that.

49:53.573 --> 49:56.994
<i>This is</i>
<i>the mental institution set.</i>

49:57.077 --> 50:02.749
As the point of view of Marc,
we go and reveal a lot of other characters

50:02.833 --> 50:06.712
<i>and motifs and visuals that we've seen</i>
<i>throughout the rest of the episodes</i>

50:06.795 --> 50:10.924
<i>and reveal in that point of view</i>
<i>that his entire reality</i>

50:11.008 --> 50:14.428
may have been shaped
by his experiences here in this asylum.

50:14.636 --> 50:16.388
Or maybe not.

50:16.596 --> 50:20.183
<i>I think that's also what was so fun</i>
<i>about this, is the puzzle pieces.</i>

50:20.267 --> 50:21.643
<i>You know, not adding something</i>

50:21.768 --> 50:23.729
just for the sake of adding
something cool,

50:23.854 --> 50:26.523
but really having it be
thematically interesting

50:26.606 --> 50:28.316
<i>and something that has a payoff.</i>

50:28.734 --> 50:30.652
-Let me out!

50:30.736 --> 50:33.113
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out! Please.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.076
It's such a mind trip, the whole thing.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.955
But then, to be able to add
these little, like, points

50:42.164 --> 50:45.292
that reorient you back
to those original things,

50:45.459 --> 50:46.877
it's just so much fun.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.004
- Steven!
- Marc!

50:56.970 --> 50:58.889
How is this possible?

50:59.556 --> 51:01.475
When we got to that part of the show

51:01.600 --> 51:04.644
when actually they're outside
of each other talking to each other.

51:04.770 --> 51:08.106
One of the crucial things was
my brother came out,

51:08.190 --> 51:11.318
<i>and he would play the other character</i>

51:11.401 --> 51:13.403
<i>whenever I had to do one,</i>
<i>so that was great.</i>

51:13.487 --> 51:15.530
<i>He's a great actor,</i>
<i>his name's Michael.</i>

51:15.614 --> 51:17.574
<i>So he was really there for me,</i>

51:18.450 --> 51:20.494
and so often, sometimes when you watch it,

51:20.619 --> 51:23.163
I'm acting with my actual little brother,
you know.

51:23.580 --> 51:25.290
So, do we... You go next, or...

51:26.208 --> 51:27.292
Who is that?

51:28.794 --> 51:30.003
Marc,

51:30.087 --> 51:33.256
why is there a child in a room filled
with people you've killed?

51:34.216 --> 51:36.718
- Steven, look, don't go near him.
- Hey, little man.

51:37.511 --> 51:38.595
What's your name? Hey!

51:38.678 --> 51:40.347
Steven, Steven. Wait! Wait! Wait!

51:40.430 --> 51:43.517
I will say that was some
of the hardest stuff I had to do,

51:43.600 --> 51:46.186
from a technical level,
because sometimes

51:46.269 --> 51:49.481
<i>I'd have to make the choices</i>
<i>for both characters beforehand.</i>

51:49.981 --> 51:52.526
<i>Rehearse it once with me as Steven.</i>

51:52.651 --> 51:54.319
<i>Then rehearse it then with me as Marc</i>

51:54.402 --> 51:57.364
<i>imagining how I wanted to react</i>
<i>at the time</i>

51:57.614 --> 51:59.533
and memorize the blocking.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.536
And then have to do it all to no one.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.247
Sometimes in a wider shot.

52:05.330 --> 52:07.082
Know what Layla would be all right with?

52:07.165 --> 52:09.709
- Don't. Just don't say it.
- I'm just saying there is

52:09.793 --> 52:11.378
one hippo and two of us, all right?

52:11.461 --> 52:13.338
It can't be that hard to steer this ship.

52:13.421 --> 52:17.467
- And we don't have to actually...
- Have to what? Kill the Goddess Taweret?

52:17.551 --> 52:19.803
Yeah. Just find me some rope
or something...

52:19.886 --> 52:21.388
Or we can do what she says,

52:21.471 --> 52:24.683
and help each other uncover whatever it is
that we're hiding, apparently.

52:24.766 --> 52:26.935
So those were some of the harder days,

52:27.018 --> 52:29.271
because it was just so
technically demanding.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.690
Right through these doors,
for example,

52:31.773 --> 52:33.817
we go through here,
there's gonna be patients,

52:33.900 --> 52:37.445
and there's Crawley
probably about to yell bingo!

52:37.571 --> 52:38.864
Oh, my God!

52:39.489 --> 52:40.490
Oh, my God!

52:40.991 --> 52:43.243
This is Taweret's boat.

52:43.785 --> 52:45.537
We've been filming here all this week.

52:45.662 --> 52:50.834
<i>Taweret is guiding them through the Duat</i>
<i>which is the ancient Egyptian Underworld.</i>

52:51.543 --> 52:54.921
Now I don't know what you two guys
have been hiding, but my advice,

52:55.088 --> 52:57.716
get in there
and show each other the truth.

52:57.966 --> 53:01.136
Balance your Scales before
we arrive at the Field of Reeds.

53:01.344 --> 53:04.097
I think that's what's so interesting
about <i>Moon Knight,</i>

53:04.389 --> 53:09.186
is that at the center of it,
you've got this really complex character

53:09.436 --> 53:12.189
<i>navigating this emotional journey.</i>

53:12.480 --> 53:15.275
What are you doing here?
Hmm?

53:17.736 --> 53:18.737
Come on, buddy.

53:18.987 --> 53:20.864
You were supposed
to keep him safe!

53:20.947 --> 53:21.948
Steven, let's go.

53:23.241 --> 53:26.494
There's a feeling of a brotherly
relationship between the two of them,

53:26.578 --> 53:29.331
despite the fact that they are technically
the same person.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.541
And there's something
almost paternal even.

53:31.625 --> 53:36.880
But ultimately this story becomes
about unifying those two sides to himself.

53:38.548 --> 53:40.467
Why do you have to make me do this?

53:40.550 --> 53:42.552
I wanna see what she did.

53:42.636 --> 53:43.678
You disgusting human.

53:43.762 --> 53:45.972
You do not need to see that.
You're not meant to.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.349
That's the whole point of you.

53:47.432 --> 53:51.937
I think it was just about being honest
to what the ideas and honest to...

53:52.979 --> 53:55.440
You know, what a lot of people
have to deal with,

53:55.523 --> 53:57.609
<i>which is really intense childhood trauma.</i>

53:57.692 --> 54:00.737
<i>And, you know, how that manifests</i>
<i>as an adult.</i>

54:01.154 --> 54:03.573
<i>Of course, there's the allegory</i>
<i>of the Moon Knight</i>

54:03.657 --> 54:05.116
<i>and the Gods and the powers.</i>

54:05.200 --> 54:08.995
But really, and it's a line
that we found in five.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.665
It's this thing
that you think is an ailment.

54:11.748 --> 54:15.877
My other personality that I can't control
and, you know, how horrible,

54:16.294 --> 54:19.839
he ends up realizing that
that's actually his superpower.

54:20.340 --> 54:23.301
All those horrible things
that she said to you,

54:23.385 --> 54:25.887
- she was wrong. It wasn't your fault.

54:27.764 --> 54:30.308
I shouldn't have brought him in the cave.

54:30.392 --> 54:31.393
Hey.

54:32.811 --> 54:35.480
Hey. You were just a child.

54:37.941 --> 54:39.359
It wasn't your fault.

54:49.119 --> 54:54.165
At the end, Marc and Steven
learn how to live together as one person,

54:54.249 --> 54:58.211
<i>which turns out to be in the final fight</i>
<i>their advantage.</i>

54:58.378 --> 55:01.965
<i>If you were to take Mr. Knight</i>
<i>and Moon Knight and combine them,</i>

55:02.257 --> 55:05.427
you'd have the ideal superhero, right?

55:05.510 --> 55:07.721
The ideal superhero with humanity.

55:07.804 --> 55:11.224
<i>They sort of complete each other,</i>
<i>and that's the whole point.</i>

55:13.393 --> 55:17.439
<i>It is a direct interpretation</i>
<i>of a healthy relationship</i>

55:17.522 --> 55:19.232
<i>in DID with their alters.</i>

55:19.357 --> 55:21.318
<i>You know, once they start</i>
<i>working together,</i>

55:21.401 --> 55:25.363
<i>and how interesting would it be</i>
<i>to see a fight scene</i>

55:25.530 --> 55:28.783
where the two of them are morphing
throughout the whole thing

55:29.034 --> 55:30.952
and actually complementing each other.

55:31.244 --> 55:35.373
And also speaks to the description
of why Moon Knight

55:35.498 --> 55:38.918
<i>is such a worthy adversary.</i>
<i>It's because he's totally unpredictable.</i>

55:43.256 --> 55:46.426
<i>I think throughout</i>
<i>the course of history,</i>

55:46.593 --> 55:48.261
the people who are truly benevolent

55:48.345 --> 55:50.889
have forgiveness
as a part of their teaching,

55:50.972 --> 55:53.933
that you still believe
that people can change

55:54.059 --> 55:55.560
<i>and they can grow and get better.</i>

55:55.685 --> 55:58.355
<i>And I think what tips Harrow</i>
<i>into the fanatic point</i>

55:58.772 --> 56:01.358
<i>is he really does not believe that.</i>

56:01.441 --> 56:05.320
<i>You know, would you wait to weed</i>
<i>the garden until after the roses are dead?</i>

56:05.403 --> 56:07.364
<i>A weed is a weed is a weed, you know.</i>

56:07.447 --> 56:10.283
<i>It's gonna kill what's good,</i>
<i>and let's just nip it in the bud.</i>

56:10.367 --> 56:13.244
Even children?
And you're like, yes, even children.

56:13.370 --> 56:18.291
<i>And that's where you get into a fanaticism</i>
<i>that most of us can't go that distance.</i>

56:19.626 --> 56:23.755
<i>At the end, it's about free choice.</i>
<i>Two ideologies fighting together.</i>

56:24.089 --> 56:26.966
One is trying to cleanse
the world from evil.

56:27.175 --> 56:30.804
<i>And the other one, "No, let's cleanse</i>
<i>whoever did something wrong."</i>

56:32.222 --> 56:34.891
It's about giving humanity a chance
to make its own mistakes

56:35.016 --> 56:36.601
and learning from its own mistakes.

56:37.352 --> 56:39.521
Had Ammit been allowed to rule,

56:39.938 --> 56:42.524
young Randall's life would've been saved,

56:42.899 --> 56:44.943
your family would have been happy.

56:45.527 --> 56:48.947
She need only remove one weed
from the garden.

56:50.156 --> 56:51.157
You.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.619
<i>We must rebind Ammit.</i>

56:54.744 --> 56:55.745
How?

56:55.829 --> 56:58.289
Only an Avatar can do it.

56:59.958 --> 57:02.585
<i>Mohamed and Antonia came to</i>

57:02.752 --> 57:05.380
the makeup trailer 30 minutes
before we were going to film.

57:05.588 --> 57:08.967
And Mohamed was like,
"Well, you see, in the Chamber of Gods,

57:09.092 --> 57:14.556
<i>"most of them, like embody the God.</i>
<i>So can you just copy Antonia,</i>

57:14.639 --> 57:18.393
"and memorize her lines
and then embody Taweret?"

57:18.643 --> 57:20.520
And I was like, "Okay."

57:26.568 --> 57:28.027
You've changed your mind.

57:30.572 --> 57:34.242
<i>It was so much fun working</i>
<i>on the physicality with May</i>

57:34.409 --> 57:36.703
<i>as we were both playing the scene out,</i>

57:36.786 --> 57:40.999
and she was copying my movements that I do
when I'm Taweret and my intonations.

57:41.249 --> 57:42.792
Say it, Antonia.

57:42.876 --> 57:45.587
- Don't be scared.
- "Don't be scared."

57:45.670 --> 57:48.465
I'm not sure it was always
going to be us two together,

57:48.548 --> 57:50.383
but there's something so great about

57:51.050 --> 57:55.805
the vibrancy and silliness of Taweret
being paired with Layla.

58:00.768 --> 58:03.480
The show didn't start
with the Scarlet Scarab,

58:03.563 --> 58:07.567
but seeing May and developing her
as an Egyptian character,

58:07.650 --> 58:11.946
step by step, the idea came up.
Let's make her into a superhero.

58:14.574 --> 58:16.784
We zeroed in on an Egyptian superhero

58:16.910 --> 58:19.287
in the Marvel universe
named the Scarlet Scarab.

58:19.370 --> 58:23.833
Traditionally, it's a male character
who goes and reappropriates

58:24.000 --> 58:26.336
Egyptian artifacts from people
who have stolen

58:26.419 --> 58:29.631
or gotten them by ill means
and returns them to the rightful owners.

58:29.714 --> 58:32.091
We thought, "Man,
the way our narrative is teeing up,

58:32.175 --> 58:35.011
<i>"that lines up with exactly</i>
<i>what we needed for our show."</i>

58:43.895 --> 58:46.064
Right now, Marvel is the world
to a lot of people.

58:46.147 --> 58:50.944
Kids, teens. To be part of that world,
it means that you exist.

58:51.236 --> 58:53.279
- Mmm.
- Representation really.

58:53.530 --> 58:57.450
I know this word now has been
thrown right and left.

58:57.534 --> 59:02.205
But having someone like this
on screen, defending good,

59:02.455 --> 59:04.832
that's the kind of story
that brings people together.

59:04.916 --> 59:07.794
Would you say this fulfills
a childhood wish for you?

59:07.919 --> 59:08.920
Absolutely.

59:14.342 --> 59:17.470
<i>I feel like, and I'm going</i>
<i>to speak from my experience,</i>

59:17.554 --> 59:21.683
like, when I've seen Arabs on film,
like, it's given me so much permission

59:21.849 --> 59:26.813
and faith that I also have a space
and a place to do that.

59:26.896 --> 59:30.900
<i>And I want women there to want</i>
<i>to express themselves through art</i>

59:30.984 --> 59:33.736
<i>and to share their story</i>
<i>and to, like, get out there more.</i>

59:33.820 --> 59:37.740
If I can share that
or help one person feel that way,

59:37.824 --> 59:39.701
then I feel like my job is done.

59:59.137 --> 1:00:00.763
Here we are in Jordan.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:06.227
<i>Well, we started in April,</i>
<i>about six months ago in Budapest.</i>

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:07.770
<i>And now, it's my last day</i>

1:00:07.854 --> 1:00:09.981
<i>and the whole crew's</i>
<i>going to be finishing up</i>

1:00:10.106 --> 1:00:12.400
<i>throughout this week on</i> Moon Knight.

1:00:12.525 --> 1:00:15.486
And this is about
the perfect place to end it,

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:19.115
right where I first fell in love
with movies, watching <i>Lawrence of Arabia,</i>

1:00:19.198 --> 1:00:21.951
I get to shoot scenes
on the same backlot.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:23.161
The planet Earth.

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:25.788
<i>Jordan was at</i>
<i>the very end of the shoot.</i>

1:00:25.872 --> 1:00:28.583
If anyone would have told me
in a span of four years,

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:31.336
I'd be going to do
three different projects

1:00:31.419 --> 1:00:34.213
in the Wadi Rum desert,
I would never have believed them.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:36.799
<i>But</i> Star Wars, Dune <i>and now</i> Moon Knight,

1:00:36.924 --> 1:00:39.052
<i>all shot in the same desert.</i>

1:00:39.302 --> 1:00:42.764
Wadi Rum, the real desert.

1:00:42.847 --> 1:00:45.308
<i>It felt like a big summer vacation</i>
<i>for everybody.</i>

1:00:45.391 --> 1:00:47.185
<i>You know, we were out in the sun,</i>

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:51.189
<i>you know, right by the the Red Sea</i>
<i>and going up to Petra.</i>

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:53.483
It was an amazing way
to end the whole thing.

1:00:55.193 --> 1:00:56.736
Whoo-hoo!

1:00:56.819 --> 1:00:58.363
It's over!

1:01:01.199 --> 1:01:03.534
<i>We're in a fascinating moment</i>
<i>of storytelling,</i>

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:06.954
which is the form of movies is changing.

1:01:08.331 --> 1:01:12.752
<i>This is not a TV show,</i>
<i>it's a movie on a larger canvas,</i>

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:15.380
<i>and we're trying to aspire to approach it</i>

1:01:15.463 --> 1:01:19.050
<i>with that level of cinema</i>
<i>and that level of quality.</i>

1:01:19.926 --> 1:01:23.054
<i>It's hard to paint such a big canvas,</i>
<i>you know. I mean,</i>

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:25.556
it's damn hard to make one good movie.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:28.601
To try to make three in a row,
you know,

1:01:28.768 --> 1:01:32.522
is asking a lot of the craftsmen
and everybody involved.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:34.357
So the lift is big.

1:01:34.607 --> 1:01:37.068
Ethan, I remember,
said to us very early on.

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:39.821
He says, "We're having a great time now.

1:01:40.113 --> 1:01:43.908
"But remember, someday you're going to be
on day 80 and you can't blink.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:46.160
"It has to be as good as day one,

1:01:46.369 --> 1:01:49.288
"because nobody's going to ever say.
'That wasn't so good.

1:01:49.414 --> 1:01:51.165
"'But they were on day 80. Poor them.'

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.875
"It has to stay.

1:01:52.959 --> 1:01:54.752
"You have to keep that dream alive."

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:58.464
It's such a challenge,
and I salute everyone who's doing TV.

1:01:59.048 --> 1:02:02.051
Especially on this kind of caliber,
making it feel cinematic.

1:02:02.176 --> 1:02:04.429
Six hours of film.

1:02:04.887 --> 1:02:09.016
Oh, my God, guys,
it was such a taxing experience,

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:11.102
but very rewarding.

1:02:11.269 --> 1:02:13.855
And I have to tell you,
one of the coolest things

1:02:13.938 --> 1:02:15.523
to get to witness on this job

1:02:15.606 --> 1:02:18.109
was seeing something at this scale.

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:22.780
And the alchemy it takes for something
of this scale to become personal.

1:02:22.905 --> 1:02:24.323
It feels like a personal story.

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:27.160
It feels like your prior movies,
and it feels like you and Sarah.

1:02:27.243 --> 1:02:29.370
And I can feel the humanity in it.

1:02:29.454 --> 1:02:33.666
And to have the structure
of the creative collaboration that we had,

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.753
that we had all those days together
in a room spitballing.

1:02:36.919 --> 1:02:41.007
I think in doing that we were able
to create something pretty bold,

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:42.842
and I think that's the aspect of it

1:02:42.967 --> 1:02:46.053
that I'm really excited about
audiences seeing.

1:02:58.399 --> 1:03:01.569
I would never have guessed,
and I don't mean this derogatorily,

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:04.989
that this would be one of my most
creatively fulfilling adventures.

1:03:05.114 --> 1:03:06.657
<i>Because it was just like,</i>

1:03:06.741 --> 1:03:08.993
<i>everybody was throwing</i>
<i>everything out on the table</i>

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:12.038
<i>and taking big swings on a major stage.</i>

1:03:12.955 --> 1:03:18.294
<i>And that we had the faith</i>
<i>and not only the space to do it,</i>

1:03:18.377 --> 1:03:20.880
but the support to do it was just amazing.

1:03:24.926 --> 1:03:27.053
<i>There are new challenges</i>
<i>and new rewards</i>

1:03:27.136 --> 1:03:29.764
that come with making longer form stories.

1:03:30.097 --> 1:03:32.433
<i>We're keeping the endings</i>
<i>more open now, I think.</i>

1:03:32.517 --> 1:03:34.519
<i>We don't have to tie up every loose end.</i>

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:37.313
<i>And when you create characters</i>

1:03:37.396 --> 1:03:39.982
<i>as strong as Moon Knight</i>
<i>and Scarlet Scarab,</i>

1:03:40.691 --> 1:03:42.610
<i>we can confidently go into the future</i>

1:03:42.693 --> 1:03:45.071
<i>knowing that there's more stories</i>
<i>left to tell</i>

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:47.949
<i>and new characters</i>
<i>that we can bring in to tell them.</i>

1:03:54.205 --> 1:03:56.666
What the hell was that?

1:03:58.167 --> 1:03:59.502
I blacked out.
