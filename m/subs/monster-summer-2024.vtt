of the bushes like this

How did you get back
to shore, Ben?

above water.

If he was pulled under water
and held down, like you said,

27:00.651 --> 27:01.748
that would have
required some force.

27:01.850 --> 27:02.913
That kind of force
would leave a mark

27:03.015 --> 27:04.950
on his arms, his neck,
something.

he'd have bruises,

36:38.829 --> 36:39.895
and they could die.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.029

36:41.131 --> 36:42.458
to blend in
like normal people.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.866
And they can even use spells

36:43.969 --> 36:45.564
to control stuff
with their mind.

36:45.666 --> 36:47.666
I think there's something
you guys should know.

36:48.401 --> 36:50.273
I made a call to the bullpen.

36:51.171 --> 36:53.008
Got our closer.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.574
What are you talking about?
Who?

36:56.982 --> 36:59.048
-Oh, my...
-What are you, nuts?

36:59.150 --> 37:00.976
Hey, guys, it's okay.
I invited him.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.094

37:12.196 --> 37:14.297

a mass grave now.

37:14.830 --> 37:15.793

37:20.366 --> 37:22.171

37:22.274 --> 37:24.634

He's a detective.

37:24.736 --> 37:27.307
-Retired.
-NOAH: All right, listen up.

37:27.409 --> 37:28.976

Kevin in those woods,

37:29.078 --> 37:30.276
just like she did Ben.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.948
But she made
a mistake this time.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.348
Set off an explosive
by accident.

37:33.450 --> 37:35.986
So she's dead then?
Nothing could survive that.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.549
I'm not so sure.
I can't explain it.

37:37.652 --> 37:39.888
I mean, there was no blood,
no body, nothing.

37:39.990 --> 37:40.782
No, there wouldn't be,

37:40.884 --> 37:42.357
'cause that's not how
you kill a witch.

37:42.459 --> 37:44.856
Hey, at the end of this
Brothers Grimm story,

37:44.958 --> 37:48.130
the guy uses silver buttons
as bullets to kill the witch.

37:48.232 --> 37:50.130
Silver bullets
only work on werewolves,

37:50.232 --> 37:51.801
-not witches.
-Not true.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.031
They kill monsters. Yeah.

37:54.134 --> 37:55.137
(CHUCKLES)

37:55.239 --> 37:56.269
What, you don't
believe in monsters?

37:56.371 --> 37:57.866
Yeah, I believe
in real monsters.

37:57.969 --> 38:00.305
I mean, I've been chasing them
my whole life.

38:00.407 --> 38:02.342
But what you're talking about,

38:02.444 --> 38:04.079
that's a wart-wearing
fairy tale.

38:04.181 --> 38:06.142
Guys, none of this
makes any sense.

38:06.511 --> 38:07.909
Witches eat kids, right?

38:08.012 --> 38:10.516
They don't turn them
into brain-dead zombies

38:10.619 --> 38:12.414
and then send them home
in time for supper.

38:12.516 --> 38:13.683
Theoretically, yes.

38:13.785 --> 38:15.886
But what if this witch
is different?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.820
Tell him that you told me.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.028
All right, well,
let's say this... this...

38:21.130 --> 38:24.400
-Witch.
-...this suspect

38:24.502 --> 38:26.532
used to live in the town
or on the outskirts of town

38:26.635 --> 38:29.570
and they abduct children
over a period of time.

38:30.604 --> 38:32.703
Stick 'em in the pot
like you say.

38:32.806 --> 38:34.305
But after a handful
of children go missing...

38:34.407 --> 38:35.672
People start to catch on.

38:35.774 --> 38:37.778
Yes. And like all
serial predators...

38:37.881 --> 38:38.773
They move.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.613
Yeah, they go
to the next place.

38:40.715 --> 38:42.778
And they start to recycle
their old behaviors again

38:42.880 --> 38:45.450
because you can't fix
these creeps.

38:45.552 --> 38:47.620
Okay, so...
How do we find her?

38:47.722 --> 38:49.320
Well, Kevin followed her
in the woods willingly,

38:49.422 --> 38:50.355
and I'm certain of that.

38:50.457 --> 38:51.624
But for that to have happened,

38:51.726 --> 38:54.059
she must have made him
feel safe, comfortable.

38:54.628 --> 38:56.432
She could have posed
as a friend or...

38:57.165 --> 38:58.167
or an old lady.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.468
Because that's what
Ellie said she was

38:59.570 --> 39:01.304
when she jumped off the bridge
and came after Ben.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.071
So that means she could be
anyone at any time,

39:04.173 --> 39:06.174
just like the T-1000.

39:06.276 --> 39:07.509
NOAH: Right.
We have to find her.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.542
It's only a matter of time
before she feeds again.

39:09.645 --> 39:11.410
Well, if you want to believe
in fairy tales,

39:11.512 --> 39:12.974
it's up to you,
but I will admit

39:13.077 --> 39:14.877
that there is something
rotten in Mayberry.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.747
I'll call an old buddy
of mine at the bureau.

39:16.849 --> 39:18.352

resources on this.

in New Hampshire,

01:01:02.524 --> 01:01:04.051

01:01:04.153 --> 01:01:06.086

and Ronnie Harlow.

01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:15.669
And then, guess what
I find this morning.

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:19.206
This missing boy
found wandering in the woods.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.168
It's Ronnie Harlow.

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.041
He has the same look
as the others.

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:26.614
What if Charlie Morgan
was her last supper?

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:29.276
After him,
she started changing her ways.

01:01:29.379 --> 01:01:31.379
Like she was feeding off
pieces of their souls.

01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:33.783
And what if Ronnie Harlow...

01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:34.852
What if he was the first one

01:01:34.954 --> 01:01:36.553
she was using
this new method on?

01:01:36.655 --> 01:01:37.655

01:01:37.757 --> 01:01:38.955
Yeah, I don't know about that,

01:01:39.057 --> 01:01:40.255
but I'll tell you
what I do know is,

01:01:40.357 --> 01:01:42.529
that Ronnie Harlow
is the first one of these kids

01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:44.895
to go missing
and turn up again

01:01:44.997 --> 01:01:47.032
with that weird look
on his face, okay.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.164
I'm gonna go out here.

01:01:49.267 --> 01:01:51.603
I'm gonna drive out
to New Hampshire tomorrow

01:01:51.705 --> 01:01:53.000
and talk to Ronnie's parents.

01:01:53.102 --> 01:01:54.509

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:56.411

I'm not sure.

01:01:56.513 --> 01:01:58.808

connect with your wife again?

01:02:06.383 --> 01:02:09.388
Yeah. You know, I think
that ship has sailed.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.987

people now.

It's not that simple, Noah.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.133
I mean, your youth...

01:02:24.236 --> 01:02:26.775
that just disappears
a little piece at a time.

of that "I'm an old man" BS.

you're still here.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.729

wouldn't have given anything

01:02:50.831 --> 01:02:52.460
for another chance
to grow old?

your father used to say

01:03:27.266 --> 01:03:29.964
he cared more about
the people in the story

01:03:30.066 --> 01:03:31.499

01:03:37.978 --> 01:03:39.540

happened to your dad.
