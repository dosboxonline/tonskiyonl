01:32.175 --> 01:34.176
My life fades...

01:35.053 --> 01:36.678
...the vision dims.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.349
All that remains are memories.

01:41.559 --> 01:45.395
I remember a time of chaos...

01:46.189 --> 01:49.858
... ruined dreams, this wasted land.

01:50.902 --> 01:55.072
But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior...

01:55.907 --> 01:58.117
...the man we called Max.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.955
To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time...

02:03.790 --> 02:06.792
...when the world was powered
by the black fuel...

02:07.335 --> 02:11.588
... and the deserts sprouted
great cities of pipe and steel.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.760
Gone noW, swept away.

02:17.512 --> 02:21.890
For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war...

02:22.308 --> 02:25.561
... and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.

02:26.229 --> 02:30.232
Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.278
The thundering machines
sputtered and stopped.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.660
Their leaders talked and talked and talked.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.499
But nothing could stem the avalanche.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.586
Their World crumbled...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.589
...the cities exploded.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.300
A whirlwind of looting...

02:57.218 --> 02:59.511
...a firestorm of fear.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.015
Men began to feed on men.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.061
On the roads,
it was a white-line nightmare.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.440
Only those mobile enough to scavenge...

03:11.983 --> 03:14.735
... brutal enough to pillage, would survive.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.113
The gangs took over the highways...

03:18.781 --> 03:22.159
... ready to wage war for a tank of juice.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.246
And in this maelstrom of decay...

03:26.748 --> 03:29.583
...ordinary men
Were battered and smashed.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.919
Men like Max.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.338
The Warrior Max.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.469
ln the roar of an engine,
he lost everything...

03:46.017 --> 03:48.143
...and became a shell of a man.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.063
A burnt-out, desolate man.

03:51.856 --> 03:55.943
A man haunted by the demons of his past.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.489
A man who wandered out
into the Wasteland.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.867
And it was here...

04:05.245 --> 04:07.120
... in this blighted place...

04:08.998 --> 04:11.250
...that he learned to live again.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.723
Don't hurt the snake. Put it down.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.393
Gently, gently. Nice. Nice.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.062
Now the iron.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.524
The gun.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.779
Down, down. Turn around.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.960
Looks like I got myself some gasoline, eh?

11:12.254 --> 11:13.296
V8?

11:14.131 --> 11:17.759
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and:

11:25.935 --> 11:28.645
Booby trap. Back up.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.358
Oh, you crafty little man, you.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.361
You're quick, very quick.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.616
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

11:43.828 --> 11:47.122
Reflexes. Yeah. That's what you've got.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.292
Me, I got brains.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.589
Hey!

11:58.467 --> 12:01.261
A fella, a quick fella...

12:01.721 --> 12:06.099
... might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.655
Hey. Hey, hey.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.535
Don't play me the fool.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.879
Gas, fuel, gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

12:36.046 --> 12:38.214
-As much as you want!
-Where? Where?

12:38.382 --> 12:41.676
Twenty miles from here.
Pumping it, they are. Refining!

12:43.137 --> 12:45.096
-A huge tanker full.
-Crap.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.682
No. No, no, no, it's true! It's true.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.935
It's not self-service, no, no.
It's too hard for me.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.022
-But a man of your ingenuity....
-Where? Where? Where?

12:55.107 --> 12:57.525
Kill me and you'll never find out.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.507
Good dog. Nice doggy, eh?

13:21.592 --> 13:22.967
Good doggy.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.892
Bless you, dog.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.961
Well, there it is.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.924
Four days I was up here...

14:03.425 --> 14:07.428
... me and the snakes,
playing mahjong, taking tea...

14:08.514 --> 14:10.390
...watching, thinking...

14:11.267 --> 14:14.102
... how was I gonna
get in and get the gas?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.439
Day and night it's pumping.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.111
Fuel to burn.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.824
They've got the lot.
Power, lights, you name it.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.578
You can bet your life they mean to keep it.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.247
Thirty of them in there.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.916
Arrows, flamethrowers, guns.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.004
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.299
Then this trash arrived...

14:45.384 --> 14:47.135
... as moths to a flame.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.346
Round and round, attack, attack...

14:51.223 --> 14:55.059
... like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.120
ln the tanker, that's where they keep it.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.166
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.504
lf anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.133
Me, I'm gonna feed the snakes.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.766
A man lives by his word, I reckon,
and I've kept mine, eh?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.153
Look, we had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

15:47.321 --> 15:51.282
-The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.
-After all I've done for you....

15:51.784 --> 15:54.410
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

16:22.773 --> 16:25.191
Attack, my vermin, attack!

16:49.675 --> 16:53.594
Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.222
For the great glory of Humungus.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.062
Smegma crazies to the left!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.776
The gate! Gayboy berserkers to the gate!

17:15.909 --> 17:17.452
I am your Lord.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.666
Attack!

24:10.699 --> 24:13.701
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.077
Save it.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.788
I'm just here for the gasoline.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.248
Yeah. Yeah.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.839
As much as you like.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.966
Just take me back there.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.432
Show your weapons and come forward!

25:22.771 --> 25:24.146
Steady now.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.150
Take it real easy.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.320
That's as far as you go.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.447
Turn around.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.826
-Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!
-Hurry, get the stretcher!

25:37.994 --> 25:39.245
Lose them.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.999
Open the gate.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.549
Hurry up with that damned stretcher.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.008
Nathan!

25:53.176 --> 25:56.136
Hey, that's fine. It's fine. Just stay here.

25:56.638 --> 25:58.430
Cover him. Cover him.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.685
Come on, quick. Quick.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.271
Oh, what a waste!

26:06.314 --> 26:07.982
Watch his leg.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.028
You and your handiwork!

26:13.196 --> 26:14.989
He didn't stand a chance!

26:15.156 --> 26:18.867
Oh, I warned him. You all heard me.
"Madness," I said.

26:19.119 --> 26:22.496
"We can escape, take our gas," he said.
"How?" I said.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.790
Get that machine inside.
Charlie, help me--

26:24.958 --> 26:26.166
Derek?

26:32.841 --> 26:34.508
Get that machine inside.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.760
Close the damned gate.

26:36.928 --> 26:39.179
Mind your backs, mind your backs.
Coming through.

26:51.526 --> 26:53.902
All right, give him room, give him room.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.866
Who are you?

26:59.909 --> 27:02.036
How did you get through out there?

27:02.203 --> 27:05.122
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

27:05.540 --> 27:08.876
Two or three miles down the road,
left for dead. We had a deal.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.337
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

27:11.504 --> 27:13.881
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.550
He said if I brought him back,
you'd give me some gas.

27:16.718 --> 27:19.887
-Now, there's not much time.
-There was a woman in the car.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.348
She's dead.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.267
What did they do?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.228
It was quick. I just want my gas,
I wanna get out of here.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.773
For all we know, he's one of them.
Give him nothing.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.608
She's right, he's a parasite.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.653
Trading in human flesh. Mercenary trash.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.823
-We had an arrangement.
-What do you mean, an arrangement?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.742
You talk to this man.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.954
No, no. Try something. Try something.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.054
lf you had a contract, it was with him.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.931
And it died with him.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.100
-Get rid of him.
-Move it.

28:06.434 --> 28:07.601
Left!

28:10.230 --> 28:11.438
Left.

28:15.235 --> 28:18.529
Gotta hand it to you, treasure.
The last of the V8 Interceptors.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.406
A piece of history.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.326
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.254
Let him go!

28:37.924 --> 28:38.924
It's all right, mate.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.720
Here they come! Close the gates!
They're coming back!

29:52.290 --> 29:56.418
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

29:56.795 --> 30:01.215
For Christ's sake, hold your fire!

30:54.102 --> 30:56.436
Greetings from the Humungus!

30:57.105 --> 30:58.772
The Lord Humungus!

30:59.524 --> 31:02.276
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

31:04.404 --> 31:08.115
The Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Roll-ah!

31:10.785 --> 31:13.036
I am gravely disappointed.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.790
Again you have made me
unleash my dogs of war.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.293
-Look at what remains...
-Help!

31:19.460 --> 31:21.461
-...of your gallant scouts.
-Kill him now...

31:21.629 --> 31:24.923
-Why? Because you're selfish.
-...while you've got the chance.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.800
You hoard your gasoline.

31:27.468 --> 31:30.220
-You will not listen to reason.
-Don't listen to him!

31:30.388 --> 31:32.472
Now, my prisoners say...

31:32.724 --> 31:36.059
...you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.855
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

31:40.398 --> 31:44.693
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.154
What a puny plan.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.364
Look around you.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.952
This is the Valley of Death.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.162
See!

31:55.914 --> 31:59.833
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the wasteland!

32:00.001 --> 32:04.171
Give them nothing. Blow it up.
Give them--

32:05.965 --> 32:08.884
Humungus will not be defied.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.324
Wez. Wez.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.368
Listen to me!

32:41.250 --> 32:43.043
I got it. I got it.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.260
Good one.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.686
Quiet. Quiet. No more games.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.313
No more games!

33:04.023 --> 33:05.857
We are here for a purpose.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.235
We've come with an offer.

33:11.739 --> 33:15.075
No. No more talk.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.577
We go in. We kill.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.871
We'll kill them!

33:22.583 --> 33:26.003
We'll kill them! Kill them. Kill them!

33:28.256 --> 33:29.923
Do you see him?

33:33.094 --> 33:35.095
Kill! Kill!

33:38.141 --> 33:40.058
Be still, my dog of war.

33:40.309 --> 33:42.227
I understand your pain.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.440
We all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.567
Losers. Losers wait.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.777
We do it my way.

33:50.945 --> 33:55.574
Their fear is our ally.
The gasoline will be ours.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.910
Then you shall have your revenge.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.667
Take him away.

34:20.516 --> 34:24.394
There has been too much violence,
too much pain.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.147
None here are without sin.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.650
But I have an honorable compromise.

34:31.652 --> 34:33.195
Just walk away.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.489
Give me the pump...

34:35.865 --> 34:37.157
...the oil...

34:37.784 --> 34:39.284
...the gasoline...

34:39.744 --> 34:43.288
... and the whole compound,
and l'll spare your lives.

34:43.998 --> 34:48.418
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the wasteland.

34:49.003 --> 34:52.672
Just walk away
and there will be an end to the horror.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.930
I await your answer.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.724
You have one full day to decide.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.045
We'll never walk away!

35:33.381 --> 35:34.548
Never!

35:56.195 --> 35:59.281
You heard what he said.
It sounds reasonable.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.075
We don't have to die.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.786
All we have to do is walk away.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.288
No. We've worked too hard.

36:06.455 --> 36:10.542
It's simple. All we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.086
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.464
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.008
Don't listen to them.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.594
All right. All right. This is it.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.096
l'll talk to this Humungus.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.598
Fool.

36:24.765 --> 36:26.641
He's a reasonable man...

36:27.643 --> 36:29.603
...open to negotiation.

36:30.062 --> 36:33.064
He promised us safe passage.
He gave his word.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.483
And let us suppose he keeps it...

36:36.110 --> 36:39.696
... and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.475
But remember.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.271
Remember one thing.
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

37:54.438 --> 37:58.858
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.820
That's 2, 000 miles from here!

38:02.488 --> 38:05.573
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

38:05.741 --> 38:08.535
lf we have to, yes. There's always a way.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.246
But the first step...

38:12.290 --> 38:13.873
...defend the fuel.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.293
Words.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.420
Just words!

38:19.088 --> 38:20.714
You'd die for a pipe dream!

38:20.881 --> 38:23.717
Wrong. We fight for a belief. I stay.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.228
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.647
You can't expect to compete with that.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.776
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.737
I'm sorry.

38:50.077 --> 38:53.621
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that'd haul that tanker.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.500
You wanna get out of here...

38:58.127 --> 38:59.669
...you talk to me.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.926
Okay, so that's my offer.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.512
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker...

39:09.680 --> 39:13.099
...you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.435
We lost eight good people this morning.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.814
What's he got in mind?

39:20.358 --> 39:23.360
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel...

39:23.611 --> 39:25.528
... and some high-octane gasoline.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.159
Think of it as a down payment.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.953
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.289
He has to come back for his wheels.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.500
What have we got to lose?

39:40.795 --> 39:42.629
You've got yourself a deal.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.115
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.667
Come on, dog.

43:56.717 --> 43:59.886
You know what I miss most of all?
Clean women.

44:00.929 --> 44:03.640
Nail polish, perfume...

44:04.391 --> 44:08.227
...the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails....

44:08.896 --> 44:10.563
-Shut up.
-Desserts.

44:11.440 --> 44:15.234
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

44:26.038 --> 44:28.414
I knew it. I knew it'd work.

44:28.707 --> 44:32.627
Lethal. Lethal, these snakes. Born killers.

44:34.421 --> 44:35.421
Down!

44:35.589 --> 44:38.633
It's my snake. I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it.

44:39.051 --> 44:42.178
So find your own. Get out of it.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.765
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.227
Fricassee of reptile. Get out.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.896
Better than your dog food. No!

44:52.606 --> 44:55.983
Pure protein, minerals, vitamins.

44:56.485 --> 44:58.945
A man's gotta look after himself.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.614
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

45:01.824 --> 45:05.535
Hey! You are what you eat, I reckon.
Get away!

45:06.620 --> 45:09.455
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.666
No style, no taste.

45:13.794 --> 45:14.961
Empty.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.630
All this time.

45:21.802 --> 45:24.762
That's dishonest. Low.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.601
Let's have a look at this machine of yours.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.813
How do I know that one's not a dud?

45:34.606 --> 45:37.567
-Find out.
-Cool. Cool, cool.

45:38.652 --> 45:42.321
Now, you've gotta understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

45:42.489 --> 45:43.823
Shut up. Shut up.

46:29.203 --> 46:32.413
What about me, eh?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

46:35.751 --> 46:37.210
Do what you want.

46:39.379 --> 46:41.297
We're partners.

46:49.598 --> 46:52.892
You and me, we're partners.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.061
Partners!

48:03.463 --> 48:04.630
Go. Go.

51:35.425 --> 51:38.052
My dogs, run. The gate.

51:42.766 --> 51:47.061
The gate. The gate. The gate.

53:07.100 --> 53:10.561
You. You can run, but you can't hide.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.797
You did a great job.

53:39.341 --> 53:43.135
That's my man.

53:43.303 --> 53:45.262
Don't go overboard now.

53:46.431 --> 53:49.600
No, don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

53:52.395 --> 54:03.155
Don't touch.

54:04.449 --> 54:05.491
Go.

54:08.995 --> 54:10.079
Go on.

54:13.416 --> 54:16.168
Tell me, son, this machine of yours...

54:17.504 --> 54:19.630
... it can take two, can it?

54:21.633 --> 54:22.883
Possibly.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.306
All right?

54:29.474 --> 54:32.935
I'm okay. Just get them organized,
we're moving out tonight.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.359
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

54:40.527 --> 54:42.903
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

54:43.071 --> 54:45.698
Timbo, Derek, Pappagallo's been hurt.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.701
How's the rig?

54:49.869 --> 54:51.537
The rig. How is she?

54:51.705 --> 54:53.038
A cracked timing case cover.

54:53.206 --> 54:55.207
It's broken some teeth
off the timing gears.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.084
It's got a cracked timing case cover.

54:57.252 --> 54:59.753
It's broken a couple of teeth
off the timing gears.

54:59.921 --> 55:03.299
-The radiator's damaged at the core.
-The radiator's damaged at the core.

55:03.466 --> 55:06.051
-A cracked water pump.
-It's got a cracked water pump.

55:06.219 --> 55:09.763
-And a fractured injector line.
-And it's got a fractured injector line.

55:09.931 --> 55:13.475
-Well, what does all that mean?
-Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

55:14.019 --> 55:15.894
-What does that mean?
-Twenty-four hours.

55:16.062 --> 55:17.563
Twenty-four hours.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.274
They've got 12.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.901
-You've got 12.
-Okay.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.069
Okay.

55:24.237 --> 55:26.613
Let's get him down. Quick, come on.

55:32.037 --> 55:34.580
Listen, I was wrong about you...

55:34.998 --> 55:36.540
... and I'm sorry.

55:52.265 --> 55:53.390
Heel.

55:53.558 --> 55:56.435
It's been a long time
since I've seen driving like that, man.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.520
You're okay by me, son.

55:58.688 --> 56:02.358
With you driving that rig, we got it licked!
Nice to have you aboard, son.

56:02.525 --> 56:05.319
I've been saving those.
I want you to have them.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.158
Thank you, and welcome.

56:14.329 --> 56:17.247
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

56:17.415 --> 56:19.291
I'm leaving. Thanks.

56:26.299 --> 56:27.925
Oh, my God, look!

56:28.093 --> 56:29.635
Up on the hill!

56:30.303 --> 56:33.055
They're stringing them up, the bastards!

56:34.933 --> 56:36.016
Look!

56:42.315 --> 56:44.441
You have defied me.

56:45.276 --> 56:49.655
You will know the vengeance
of Lord Humungus.

56:50.782 --> 56:52.366
I promise you...

56:53.326 --> 56:54.827
... nobody...

56:55.412 --> 56:59.164
... nobody gets out of here alive.

57:50.258 --> 57:54.636
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums? Come on!

57:55.972 --> 57:58.891
Hey, don't forget,
don't waste a bit before we leave.

58:02.061 --> 58:03.604
Just wanna catch the pigs.

58:03.771 --> 58:06.064
Come on with the drums, come on!

58:06.232 --> 58:08.358
Is anybody helping over there?

58:12.197 --> 58:13.405
Hey, come on!

58:46.606 --> 58:49.691
What's wrong? Come on.

58:50.193 --> 58:53.654
It just seems really wrong,
sneaking away like this.

58:57.659 --> 59:00.827
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

59:01.037 --> 59:02.788
I know I did, but....

59:03.957 --> 59:07.251
Look, you're scared. Now, come on,
it'll be much safer up there.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.753
-What are we waiting for, eh?
-No, don't.

59:11.756 --> 59:13.465
This is my family.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.427
I'm not gonna leave these people.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.097
I'm staying.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.767
I'm sorry.

59:33.611 --> 59:36.697
Come on, keep it together.

59:53.923 --> 59:56.508
I told you, he's leaving.
What did I tell you?

59:56.676 --> 59:58.176
Look, he's leaving.

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:04.391
Look, I don't have time for long speeches.
I want you to drive the tanker.

1:00:06.185 --> 1:00:07.352
Sorry.

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:12.065
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

1:00:13.109 --> 1:00:15.152
We'll make a new contract.

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:20.907
I've got all I need here.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:25.329
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:26.580
Max...

1:00:26.831 --> 1:00:28.915
... buy a ticket for 2, 000 miles.

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:33.378
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise.

1:00:34.213 --> 1:00:36.048
Two thousand miles from here.

1:00:36.382 --> 1:00:38.800
Fresh water, plenty of sunshine.

1:00:39.344 --> 1:00:41.345
Nothing to do but breed.

1:00:43.056 --> 1:00:44.389
No, thanks.

1:00:45.141 --> 1:00:48.143
What is it with you, huh?
What are you looking for?

1:00:48.811 --> 1:00:51.647
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

1:00:52.231 --> 1:00:54.483
You happy out there, are you?

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:57.444
Wandering?
One day blurring into another?

1:00:58.363 --> 1:01:01.239
You're a scavenger, Max.
You're a maggot.

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:03.158
Do you know that?

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:06.078
You're living off the corpse
of the old world.

1:01:06.579 --> 1:01:08.789
Tell me your story.
Come on, tell me your story.

1:01:08.956 --> 1:01:10.457
What burned you out?

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:12.125
Kill one man too many?

1:01:12.293 --> 1:01:14.628
See too many people die?
Lose some family?

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:19.091
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:20.926
Listen to me.

1:01:43.324 --> 1:01:46.118
Do you think
you're the only one that's suffered?

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:50.247
We've all been through it in here.
But we haven't given up.

1:01:51.582 --> 1:01:54.292
We're still human beings with dignity.

1:01:54.919 --> 1:01:58.547
But you, you're out there
with the garbage.

1:01:59.090 --> 1:02:00.632
You're nothing.

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:43.759
Get out, kid.

1:02:46.679 --> 1:02:48.680
Come on, get out of here.

1:03:09.994 --> 1:03:12.621
Go on, get out. Scat. Get out.

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:46.071
You're letting him go?

1:03:47.907 --> 1:03:50.242
Well, let's keep his vehicle, at least.

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:54.704
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

1:03:56.249 --> 1:03:58.917
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:01.336
I am.

1:04:28.197 --> 1:04:30.657
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:33.285
Stupid maybe, but not a coward.

1:04:34.453 --> 1:04:36.788
You're making a serious mistake...

1:04:37.915 --> 1:04:40.000
... splitting a great team.

1:04:40.918 --> 1:04:43.670
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

1:04:43.838 --> 1:04:46.798
See you around, maybe.
Goodbye, good luck.

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:15.368
We go!

1:05:26.464 --> 1:05:29.174
You disobey me. You puppy.

1:06:31.904 --> 1:06:34.239
Toadie, the gas. Hurry up.

1:06:42.581 --> 1:06:45.417
Don't waste him. lf he's alive...

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:47.752
... I want him.

1:07:13.946 --> 1:07:18.283
The tanks are full, O, mighty Wez,
and it's all yours!

1:08:13.339 --> 1:08:14.839
It's all over.

1:08:15.758 --> 1:08:17.050
Let's go.

1:08:29.396 --> 1:08:31.856
Look, out there. Northwest.

1:08:40.032 --> 1:08:41.533
Oh, hell.

1:08:44.036 --> 1:08:45.870
You blew it, you fool.

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:05.700
Relax, partner.

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:43.965
l'll be driving the tanker.

1:11:45.092 --> 1:11:48.094
We're gonna crash or crash through.

1:11:49.763 --> 1:11:53.099
Now at this point, that's all they want.
The tanker.

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:55.852
So they'll come straight after us.

1:11:56.020 --> 1:11:58.730
So we'll use that to punch our way out...

1:11:59.023 --> 1:12:01.899
...which will give all of you
a very, very good chance.

1:12:02.401 --> 1:12:03.901
Now, don't hesitate.

1:12:04.069 --> 1:12:08.156
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:11.492
Now, 200 miles to the north...

1:12:12.202 --> 1:12:16.581
...there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

1:12:16.999 --> 1:12:18.916
That's our rendezvous.

1:12:20.252 --> 1:12:22.045
Give us till sunset.

1:12:23.088 --> 1:12:26.674
lf we haven't made it by then, keep going.

1:12:27.551 --> 1:12:29.719
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride on?

1:12:29.887 --> 1:12:32.472
-You are not coming on this tanker!
-I sweated blood on this...

1:12:32.639 --> 1:12:35.350
... and no bastard's gonna tell me
to ride in no school bus!

1:12:35.517 --> 1:12:37.101
Okay, settle down!

1:12:37.478 --> 1:12:39.604
lf it's all the same to you...

1:12:41.273 --> 1:12:43.191
... l'll drive that tanker.

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.112
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

1:12:48.822 --> 1:12:51.324
No deals. I wanna drive that truck.

1:12:52.451 --> 1:12:55.286
Why? Why the big change of heart?

1:12:55.454 --> 1:12:57.288
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

1:12:57.456 --> 1:12:59.582
And how do you think you'll do it?

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:03.127
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair.

1:13:04.630 --> 1:13:07.715
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

1:13:09.134 --> 1:13:11.010
Come on, cut the crap.

1:13:12.805 --> 1:13:15.139
I'm the best chance you've got.

1:13:23.482 --> 1:13:25.274
Right, let's get moving.

1:14:37.055 --> 1:14:39.265
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

1:15:55.634 --> 1:15:56.926
Oh, shit!

1:19:12.164 --> 1:19:16.250
Go! Go, go, go, go!

1:20:26.696 --> 1:20:28.697
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1:20:34.913 --> 1:20:36.747
Move it. Move it.

1:21:08.530 --> 1:21:10.948
Come on, come on, come on!

1:23:06.856 --> 1:23:09.900
The tire! Shoot the tire!

1:25:44.180 --> 1:25:46.640
Boy! Come on, jump!

1:25:47.684 --> 1:25:48.934
Come on, jump!

1:25:49.686 --> 1:25:50.686
I say.

1:25:51.563 --> 1:25:52.896
We've won.

1:25:53.439 --> 1:25:55.190
It's over, boy.

1:27:43.508 --> 1:27:44.633
Hey, kid.

1:27:45.551 --> 1:27:47.261
Get the bullet. The bullet.

1:27:47.679 --> 1:27:49.471
Get up. Go on.

1:27:53.643 --> 1:27:58.188
Get the shell.

1:27:58.356 --> 1:28:00.107
Come on. Come on, go!

1:31:32.069 --> 1:31:35.405
And so began the journey north to safety...

1:31:36.073 --> 1:31:37.741
...to our place in the sun.

1:31:38.326 --> 1:31:42.329
Among us we found a new leader,
the man who came from the sky...

1:31:42.788 --> 1:31:44.456
...the Gyro Captain.

1:31:44.957 --> 1:31:47.250
And just as Pappagallo had planned...

1:31:47.418 --> 1:31:50.754
...we traveled far beyond
the reach of men on machines.

1:31:51.631 --> 1:31:55.592
The juice, the precious juice,
was hidden in the Vehicles.

1:31:57.345 --> 1:31:59.554
As for me, I grew to manhood...

1:32:00.223 --> 1:32:03.141
... in the fullness of time,
I became the leader...

1:32:03.309 --> 1:32:05.936
...the chief of the Great Northern Tribe.

1:32:07.855 --> 1:32:09.689
And the Road Warrior?

1:32:10.566 --> 1:32:13.193
That was the last we ever saw of him.

1:32:14.111 --> 1:32:18.281
He lives now only in my memories.
