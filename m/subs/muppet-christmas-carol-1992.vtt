03:58.939 --> 04:00.737
My name is Charles Dickens.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.143

04:11.218 --> 04:14.017
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.316
A genius.

You are too kind.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.156
Why should I believe you?

04:19.226 --> 04:22.821
Because I know the story of <i>A</i> Christmas

04:22.896 --> 04:25.092

04:39.546 --> 04:40.741
The... Pardon me?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.543
That's how the story begins,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.017
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

04:45.085 --> 04:47.520
As dead as a doornail.

It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.755
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.592
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

04:56.663 --> 05:01.066
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.229

At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

12:40.193 --> 12:44.494
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.124
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.464
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.197
Oh. Excellent.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.069
For a moment, I was worried.

Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.878
What might I put you down for?

12:59.946 --> 13:00.970
Nothing.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.109
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.244
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.412
That certainly is true.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.523
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.149
That is certainly not true.

Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

is on this side of the house. Jump.

in this life I hate.

[cat meows, kids shout]

34:27.833 --> 34:30.324
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

34:30.402 --> 34:33.702
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

34:33.772 --> 34:38.869
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

It's my old school.

I was a boy here.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.482
That's Henry.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.820
And Edmund, my best friend.

Hello, boys. Hello.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.360
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.059
They can neither see nor hear you.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.466
Come, let us go inside.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.829
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.604
- Save me, save me!
- [cat meows viciously]

35:30.195 --> 35:33.631
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

35:33.698 --> 35:36.827
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.997
I know it all so well, spirit.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.701
The desks.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.968
The smell of the chalk.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.576
I chose my profession in this room.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.380
And is he, too, familiar?

35:56.354 --> 36:00.018
[Dickens] Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

36:00.091 --> 36:02.560
oh, very well indeed.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.091
Good heavens.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.725
It's me.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.236
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.602
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.005
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.139
I was often alone.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.977
More time for reading... and study.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.988
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.887
A time for... solitude.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.395
Rats don't understand these things.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.592
You were never a lonely child?

36:41.666 --> 36:45.102
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

36:45.170 --> 36:49.164
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.768
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

36:52.844 --> 36:55.006
They were all very much the same.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.213
Nothing ever changed.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.378
You changed.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.870
[Dickens] The years performed
their terrible dance.

37:24.943 --> 37:29.107
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.344
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.250
What the... Hey!

37:35.320 --> 37:36.310
Agh!

37:41.359 --> 37:44.522
That's my old headmaster.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.792
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

Today you go forth into the real world.

You must keep your nose

as this very building.

Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

38:19.597 --> 38:20.826
Yes, headmaster.

Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

Today, you become a man of business.

43:36.781 --> 43:40.843
There was, of course, another

43:40.918 --> 43:43.250
some years later.

44:11.215 --> 44:13.274
It can't be helped, Belle.

44:14.452 --> 44:18.582
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.920
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.983
So you said last year.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.757
Business continues to be poor.

Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

58:19.928 --> 58:22.022
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

58:26.068 --> 58:28.366
Merry Christmas, everyone.

58:28.437 --> 58:29.563
Daddy!

58:32.841 --> 58:34.172
Merry Christmas, girls.

58:34.243 --> 58:36.439
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

58:36.511 --> 58:39.173
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

58:39.248 --> 58:42.081
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

58:42.150 --> 58:45.586
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

58:45.654 --> 58:46.985
Crachy.

58:47.756 --> 58:48.746
Emmy

58:53.128 --> 58:57.429
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

58:57.499 --> 59:00.332
You have all the fun.

59:00.402 --> 59:02.427
What?

59:02.504 --> 59:05.132
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

59:05.207 --> 59:07.141
The goose, the goose.

59:07.209 --> 59:09.075
[laughs, coughs]

59:10.612 --> 59:14.480
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

59:14.549 --> 59:18.782
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

59:18.854 --> 59:22.688
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

59:22.758 --> 59:24.920
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

59:24.993 --> 59:28.520
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

59:28.597 --> 59:32.693
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

59:32.768 --> 59:34.759
A remarkable child.

59:36.238 --> 59:39.139
[Dickens] With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

59:39.207 --> 59:43.303
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

59:43.378 --> 59:47.178
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

59:49.051 --> 59:51.315
I pay Bob such a small amount.

59:51.386 --> 59:53.878
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

59:53.956 --> 59:56.050
Bob Cratchit?

59:56.124 --> 59:59.094
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

59:59.161 --> 01:00:01.960
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:05.295
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:09.235
If l had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:11.238
And I bet he would choke on it.

01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:13.775
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:15.071
Christmas Day.

01:00:15.143 --> 01:00:19.603
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

01:00:19.681 --> 01:00:23.311
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:26.650
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

01:00:26.722 --> 01:00:30.522
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

01:00:30.592 --> 01:00:34.324
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:40.392
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:41.459
No doubt.

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:42.833
Mm. Cheers.

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:48.241
God bless us, every one.

[coughs]

01:03:26.468 --> 01:03:29.927
[Emmy] Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

01:03:30.005 --> 01:03:34.169
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:36.301
That is the future.

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:38.369
My realm is the present.

01:03:38.446 --> 01:03:43.816
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

01:03:43.885 --> 01:03:46.217
And a crutch without an owner.

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:51.783
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.319
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:58.662
and decrease the surplus population.

01:03:58.733 --> 01:04:00.132
Oh, spirit.

01:04:00.202 --> 01:04:03.331
[Dickens] As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:07.672
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

01:04:07.742 --> 01:04:11.303
Come. My time grows short.

01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.370
[wind whistles]

01:04:18.186 --> 01:04:20.120
Spirit, do you grow old?

01:04:20.188 --> 01:04:22.748
I do. [chuckles]

01:04:24.993 --> 01:04:27.257
Are spirits' lives so short?

01:04:27.329 --> 01:04:30.321
My time upon this globe is very brief.

01:04:30.398 --> 01:04:35.666
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.571
- [ding]
- [Rizzo] One.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.407
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:46.310
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:49.578
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:51.642
[Rizzo] Five!

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.052
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:56.921
I think I must, in fact.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:05:00.086
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

01:05:00.195 --> 01:05:05.531
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.002
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.128
Must I?

01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:15.974
Go forth, and know him better, man.
[laughs]

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:02.448
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

01:06:06.294 --> 01:06:12.290
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

01:06:14.135 --> 01:06:17.298
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

01:06:17.372 --> 01:06:20.637
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

01:06:20.709 --> 01:06:24.543
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

01:06:25.413 --> 01:06:30.146
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

01:06:33.488 --> 01:06:35.957
Will you not speak to me?

01:06:40.261 --> 01:06:44.323
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

01:06:44.399 --> 01:06:46.390
Lead on, spirit.

01:07:09.724 --> 01:07:12.455
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

01:07:12.527 --> 01:07:15.224
I only know he's dead.

01:07:15.296 --> 01:07:18.459
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:21.833
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

01:07:21.903 --> 01:07:23.268
[all laugh]

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:25.534
I don't know or care why he's gone.

01:07:25.607 --> 01:07:28.042
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:29.634
Wouldn't we all?

01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:31.475
He didn't give it to me.

01:07:32.847 --> 01:07:35.441
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

01:07:35.517 --> 01:07:38.350
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.752
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

01:07:40.822 --> 01:07:43.052
If lunch is provided.

01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:45.252
[all snort and laugh]

01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.658
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

01:07:50.999 --> 01:07:53.798
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

01:07:53.868 --> 01:07:56.894
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:16.381
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:19.984
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.189
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:24.560
What have you got for old Joe?

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:28.432
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:30.301
Joe, get off.

01:08:30.371 --> 01:08:34.365
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

01:08:35.443 --> 01:08:37.673
Mother of pearl.

01:08:37.745 --> 01:08:40.510
No, I got his bed curtains.

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:43.643
Very fine damask. [laughs]

01:08:43.718 --> 01:08:47.518
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:49.819
I've got his blankets.

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:55.421
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:59.091
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:02.193
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:03.863
[all laugh]

01:09:09.577 --> 01:09:11.203
I understand, spirit.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:14.647
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:17.377
My life turns that way now.

01:09:17.452 --> 01:09:19.443
Merciful heavens.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:23.948
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

01:09:24.024 --> 01:09:27.393
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

01:09:35.002 --> 01:09:37.836
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

01:09:37.906 --> 01:09:40.341
Oh, yes, spirit.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.399
A place of joy and laughter.

01:09:43.344 --> 01:09:45.870
Thank you for bringing me here.

01:09:51.419 --> 01:09:53.716
It's so quiet.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.457
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:12.705
[sniffing]

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:17.342
Mother, you're crying again.

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:20.848
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:27.377
Not Tiny Tim?

01:10:28.856 --> 01:10:33.259
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

01:10:33.328 --> 01:10:36.696
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

01:10:36.764 --> 01:10:39.028
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.933
He should be back now.

01:10:42.003 --> 01:10:46.839
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:50.037
Hello, my dears.

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:51.237
Daddy.

01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:55.445
Hello, girls.

01:10:55.516 --> 01:10:56.574
Hello, Peter.

01:10:56.651 --> 01:10:59.985
Children, please go set the table.

01:11:00.054 --> 01:11:01.920
Thank you.

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:03.583
How was the churchyard?

01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:05.251
It will be lovely, Emily.

01:11:05.326 --> 01:11:09.422
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:14.333
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:17.235
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

01:11:17.305 --> 01:11:19.774
You can see the ducks on the river.

01:11:19.841 --> 01:11:21.070
Tiny Tim...

01:11:21.142 --> 01:11:24.942
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

01:11:28.182 --> 01:11:33.518
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.481
How can we endure it?

01:11:40.328 --> 01:11:42.592
It's all right, children.

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:46.165
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

01:11:46.234 --> 01:11:48.066
That is the way of it.

01:11:49.237 --> 01:11:52.366
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.239
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

01:12:01.082 --> 01:12:03.244
[quiet sniffing]

01:12:31.813 --> 01:12:33.975
Must we return to this place?

01:12:37.518 --> 01:12:39.680
There is something else
that I must know?

01:12:39.754 --> 01:12:42.280
Is that not true?

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:47.226
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

01:12:47.295 --> 01:12:49.730
I fear to, but I must.

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:52.693
Who was the wretched man

01:12:52.767 --> 01:12:55.634
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

01:13:08.683 --> 01:13:10.617
Answer me one more question.

01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:13.154
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

01:13:13.221 --> 01:13:15.883
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:27.698
These events can be changed.

01:13:40.047 --> 01:13:42.379
A life can be made right.

01:14:03.271 --> 01:14:05.399
Ebenezer Scrooge.

01:14:05.473 --> 01:14:08.306
Oh, please, spirit, no.

01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:10.902
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.014
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:21.622
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

01:14:24.192 --> 01:14:28.595
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

01:14:28.663 --> 01:14:32.429
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.834
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

01:14:38.539 --> 01:14:41.270
Spirit, please speak to me.

01:14:45.246 --> 01:14:47.044
[clock ticks]

01:15:00.328 --> 01:15:01.989
I'm home.

01:15:05.566 --> 01:15:07.591
[Dickens]
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:10.968
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

01:15:11.038 --> 01:15:13.268
Hi, guys, we're back.

01:15:13.341 --> 01:15:15.309
We promised we would be.

01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:17.868
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:19.936
was that his life lay before him.

01:15:20.014 --> 01:15:22.108
And it could be changed.

01:15:22.183 --> 01:15:25.619
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

01:15:25.686 --> 01:15:28.212
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

01:15:28.289 --> 01:15:30.883
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:33.120
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

01:15:33.194 --> 01:15:34.457
On my knees.

01:15:34.528 --> 01:15:38.055
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:40.760
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

01:15:45.873 --> 01:15:48.501
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

01:15:48.576 --> 01:15:51.910
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

01:15:51.979 --> 01:15:54.710
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:56.807
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

01:15:56.884 --> 01:15:58.045
Yeah.

01:16:01.789 --> 01:16:03.689
You there, boy.

01:16:03.758 --> 01:16:05.283
What, me?

01:16:06.327 --> 01:16:08.659
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

01:16:08.729 --> 01:16:11.061
- What's today?
- Pardon?

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:13.191
What's today, my fine fellow?

01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:15.964
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

01:16:16.037 --> 01:16:17.562
It's Christmas Day?

01:16:17.638 --> 01:16:20.869
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:24.003
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

01:16:24.078 --> 01:16:26.547
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

01:16:26.614 --> 01:16:28.446
Know the poultry shop nearby?

01:16:28.516 --> 01:16:30.883
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

01:16:30.952 --> 01:16:33.444
A remarkable lad.

01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:36.616
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:39.786
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.919
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

01:16:41.996 --> 01:16:44.431
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

01:16:44.498 --> 01:16:47.593
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

01:16:47.668 --> 01:16:50.000
No, I'll give you five shillings.

01:16:51.973 --> 01:16:53.202
WOW!

01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:56.073
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

01:16:57.712 --> 01:16:59.510
Um... Sorry.

01:17:00.681 --> 01:17:02.809
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

01:17:02.883 --> 01:17:06.751
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

01:17:06.821 --> 01:17:10.223
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:12.851
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

01:17:12.927 --> 01:17:16.727
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

01:17:16.797 --> 01:17:18.891
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:18.966 --> 01:17:20.900
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:23.266
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:17:25.139 --> 01:17:26.937
Gee, thanks.

01:17:27.008 --> 01:17:30.603
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

01:17:30.678 --> 01:17:34.046
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

01:17:34.115 --> 01:17:35.605
- [yelps]
- [gasps]

01:17:35.683 --> 01:17:37.242
Mr. Scrooge.

01:17:37.318 --> 01:17:39.912
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:41.785
you asked me for yesterday?

01:17:41.856 --> 01:17:43.415
Put me down for...

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.886
That much?

01:17:46.961 --> 01:17:48.793
Not a penny less.

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:51.855
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

01:17:51.932 --> 01:17:54.765
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:57.827
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

01:18:03.144 --> 01:18:05.340
A sin?

01:18:05.413 --> 01:18:07.507
A gift for me?

01:18:15.122 --> 01:18:16.647
Thank you.

01:18:17.358 --> 01:18:18.553
Thank you.

01:18:18.626 --> 01:18:22.824
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.

You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

01:21:47.901 --> 01:21:50.165
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

01:21:53.941 --> 01:21:55.807
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:57.640
I mean, yes, but you did.

01:21:57.711 --> 01:21:59.679
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:04.142
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

01:22:04.218 --> 01:22:06.619
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

01:22:06.687 --> 01:22:09.054
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

01:22:25.539 --> 01:22:28.873
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

01:22:28.942 --> 01:22:32.572

01:22:44.758 --> 01:22:47.193
[Dickens] And Scrooge
was better than his word.

01:22:47.261 --> 01:22:49.992
He did it all, and infinitely more.

01:22:50.064 --> 01:22:51.964
And, er, Tiny Tim?

01:22:52.032 --> 01:22:53.591
And Tiny Tim,

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:55.294
who did not die...

01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:56.894
Isn't that swell?

01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:00.235
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

01:23:00.307 --> 01:23:02.969
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:06.809
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.941
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

01:23:10.017 --> 01:23:12.384
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:16.686
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:19.283
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.330
