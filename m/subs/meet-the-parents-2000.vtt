WEBVTT

02:21.559 --> 02:24.103
I know we haven't
been together that long,

02:24.270 --> 02:28.524
but these last ten months have
just been the happiest of my life.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.862
You're not only the person I love,
you're also my best friend,

02:33.612 --> 02:36.574
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

02:38.743 --> 02:40.536
Will you marry me?

02:40.703 --> 02:42.830
Yes.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.458
Seriously.
Do you think that sounds good?

02:46.375 --> 02:47.710
– No!
– Really?

02:47.877 --> 02:50.963
– 'Cause I think that kinda sums up…
– No!

02:51.130 --> 02:53.090
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.427
Sometimes these catheters
can pinch a little bit.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.763
Well, thanks for listening.
I really appreciate it.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.434
You've got a real
gentle touch there, doctor.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.728
She won't be able to say no.

03:05.895 --> 03:10.066
Actually, I'm a nurse.
Doctor'll be right in.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.071
– Good luck, Greg.
– Thanks, Kim.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.238
Good luck, buddy.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.790
OK, it's time
for our problem of the week.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.626
I want you to pick out your problem,

03:28.793 --> 03:31.462
a problem that's been
bothering you all week,

03:31.629 --> 03:34.840
with your eyes still closed…

03:35.800 --> 03:38.386
…I want you to picture that problem
in your mind.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.138
Pretend that it's right there
in front of you.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.557
Not only are you my best friend,

03:43.724 --> 03:46.811
but you're also the person I
wanna spend the rest of my life with.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.774
I love you.
Will you… marry me?

03:51.941 --> 03:56.612
Now I want you to scare your
problems away. I want you to say, «boo.»

03:56.779 --> 03:58.823
Boo.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.283
– Boo!
– Boo!

04:03.869 --> 04:05.246
All right, you guys are great.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.582
Very good. I will see you guys
after lunch, all right?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.335
Hey, Pam, isn't that
your special friend outside?

04:12.503 --> 04:15.131
Yeah, I think so.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.173
Why don't you go talk to him?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.927
– You think I should?
– Yeah.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.765
Come here.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.687
– Hi, sweetie.
– How you doin'?

04:29.854 --> 04:32.189
– What's going on?
– I just was in the neighborhood.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.817
Got off work early. Thought maybe
you wanted to get a bite to eat.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.820
Oh, that's very sweet.
What a nice surprise.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.449
Oh, shoot, I forgot to change my shoes.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.743
You don't have to change. I can't
resist a man in nurse's shoes.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.121
I know, but I got sneakers
in my backpack.

04:47.288 --> 04:50.249
– It'll just take a second.
– OK.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.793
Honey…

04:52.960 --> 04:55.379
– Pam, I love you.
– Yeah?

04:55.546 --> 04:58.841
I love you, too.
Come on, sweetie.

04:59.008 --> 05:02.219
I got a half hour before I have to be
back, so you wanna go have lunch?

05:03.888 --> 05:07.475
– What are you doing?
– Nothing.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.019
I just love you so much.

05:10.186 --> 05:14.064
These last ten months have been
the happiest of my life.

05:14.231 --> 05:18.277
Yeah, they've been amazing.
What's going on?

05:18.444 --> 05:22.823
Nothing. I just…
I just feel like we're so close.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.702
You're my best friend, and you're
also the woman that I love, and…

05:26.869 --> 05:29.246
Are you OK, sweetie?
You're acting so weird.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.998
I'm fine.
I just got a crick in my neck.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.043
I was doing CPR on a 300 pound
crack addict this morning.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.753
Want me to massage your neck
or something?

05:35.920 --> 05:37.421
– No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm good.
– A back rub? Are you sure?

05:37.588 --> 05:39.507
Your kids, they're trying
to tell you something.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.009
– What? Hold on.
– Look!

05:42.176 --> 05:44.845
– Oh, it's my sister. Hello? Hi!
<i>– I'm engaged!</i>

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
<i>Bob and I are getting married
in two weeks!</i>

05:47.306 --> 05:49.892
You're engaged! That's wonderful.
Congratulations!

05:50.059 --> 05:54.438
Oh, my God, you're getting married
in two weeks. That's a little soon.

05:54.605 --> 05:58.609
Wow, Mom and Dad really don't know
Bob very well. Dad was OK with this?

05:58.776 --> 06:02.071
<i>– Well, Bob asked Dad.</i>
– Wow, that was very thoughtful of him.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.657
I can't believe he knew
to ask Dad's permission.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.159
Yeah.

06:07.326 --> 06:11.288
I'm just here with Greg. He's gonna
take me out for lunch. He's OK.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.958
OK, yeah, I know you gotta go.
All right. I love you.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.668
OK, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.671
So what's going on? What?
Debbie's marrying that guy?

06:18.837 --> 06:23.133
Yeah, in two weeks. Dr. Bob of Denver.
Isn't that great?

06:23.300 --> 06:27.096
Yeah, yeah, that's… Didn't they
just meet like a few months ago?

06:27.263 --> 06:29.473
Well, yeah, but, you know,
he asked her, and she said yes.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.725
He asked my dad. He said yes.
Then he asked Debbie.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.646
Yeah, I overheard that. So, what,
like he had to ask his permission?

06:35.813 --> 06:37.815
No, no, he didn't have to.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.193
Bob understood that Dad appreciates
that kind of thing, you know?

06:42.528 --> 06:44.780
Anyway, Deb said
that Dad's crazy about him.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.117
Evidently, Bob bought him
the perfect gift that won him over.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.995
– You know?
– Really? A gift?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.373
Are you sure it's OK to X-ray this?

06:54.540 --> 06:56.667
Yeah, it's not gonna mutate or anything.

07:00.004 --> 07:03.007
– Sir, that's not gonna fit.
– Wait. Hang on a second.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.594
The bag's too big, guy.
You gotta check it.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.430
Over here.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.682
– Raise your arms, sir.
– Look.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.310
I've got an engagement ring
for my girlfriend in the bag.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.438
I can't really open it here.
Don't you think I can just carry it on?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.732
Hey, pal, if it ain't
fittin' through the frame,

07:19.898 --> 07:22.276
you ain't carryin' it on the plane.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.946
– 531. New York La Guardia. Check it.
– Wait, wait!

07:26.113 --> 07:27.906
– Excuse me!
– Don't worry, pal.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.200
It'll be waitin' for you
on the other side.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.708
<i>Welcome to New York's
La Guardia Airport.</i>

07:46.425 --> 07:48.886
Excuse me. Hi.

07:49.053 --> 07:51.805
You lost my bag, and there's
a two-carat diamond ring inside it.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.891
I didn't lose your anything, sir.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.895
But put your local address on this form,
and we'll ship it when it surfaces.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.522
What if it doesn't? Am I supposed
to spend the entire weekend

08:00.689 --> 08:02.399
with just the clothes on my back?

08:06.445 --> 08:09.239
It's a great gift. I just thought
you were gonna get them champagne.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.242
I think your dad is gonna be
very psyched about this gift.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.411
Well, don't forget he's retired, though.

08:14.578 --> 08:18.082
The guy was in the rare-flower business.
I think he still maintains an interest.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.293
You make it sound like
they're really hard to please.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.586
No, not at all!

08:22.753 --> 08:25.297
He's the sweetest man
in the whole world. Just relax!

08:25.464 --> 08:29.426
– He's gonna love you. I promise.
– As much as he loves Dr. Bob?

08:29.593 --> 08:33.054
Take it easy on the sarcasm.
Humor is entirely wasted on my parents.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.557
What, are they Amish?

08:39.269 --> 08:41.020
OK, no jokes.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.442
– What are you doing?
– What?

08:45.901 --> 08:48.737
I told you my dad sees smoking
as a sign of weakness.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.364
OK, all right,
I'll leave 'em in the car.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.491
No, no, no, no, he'll check there.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.743
– Oh, gosh.
– What…

08:57.955 --> 09:00.040
Yeah, the roof is
probably a better idea.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.959
Hey. Oh, and…

09:02.126 --> 09:04.753
…we're not living together.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.798
– I thought you said you told him.
– Well…

09:09.216 --> 09:12.052
– Hi, Daddy! Hi!
– Sweet pea!

09:12.219 --> 09:16.014
– I missed you so much, Pamcake.
– I missed you too, Flapjack.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.105
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

09:23.981 --> 09:26.775
Short stack, short stack, coming up.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.654
Where's my «wittle» girl?

09:30.821 --> 09:34.992
– Mommy! Mom!
– You look so beautiful.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.578
So do you. Look at you.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.913
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.207
Hi, Greg.
I'm Pam's father, Jack Byrnes.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.333
Great to finally meet you.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.086
– Good meeting you.
– And I'm Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.548
Oh…

09:52.134 --> 09:53.677
What are you driving there, a Ford?

09:54.678 --> 09:56.680
Oh, yeah, it's a Taurus.

09:56.847 --> 10:00.601
We were gonna get a mid-size, but I
figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.188
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.149
Sure. Interesting color. You pick it?

10:07.316 --> 10:10.027
Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?

10:10.194 --> 10:13.697
Well, they say geniuses pick green.

10:13.864 --> 10:17.659
– But you didn't pick it.
– Jack!

10:19.411 --> 10:22.539
Oh, yucky. What smells
of old sour milk?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.584
– Poor Greg got spit up on by a baby.
– He didn't.

10:25.751 --> 10:29.171
He did, Ma, at the lost luggage
counter. The airline lost his bag.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.881
They didn't!

10:31.048 --> 10:32.508
– Yeah.
– Yeah, they did.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.927
– What about you, honey?
– Oh, no. I carried on.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.720
That's my girl.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.057
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

10:40.224 --> 10:44.228
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.

10:44.394 --> 10:48.148
– That's right. <i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>
– Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.609
Yeah.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.614
– Hey, Mom, the house looks great.
– Really? Oh, good.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.909
– We spruced up for the wedding.
– This is so nice.

10:59.076 --> 11:02.246
– We like it.
– Beautiful.

11:02.412 --> 11:06.583
Oh, now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.

11:06.750 --> 11:11.338
We were curious,
how do you pronounce it?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.924
Oh, just like it's spelled.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.635
F-O-C-K-E-R.

11:18.303 --> 11:22.349
– Focker.
– Focker.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.522
– Oh, I'll get it, honey.
– Oh, thanks, Mom.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.859
– There he is. There's our little guy.
– Jinxy, come here, boy.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.863
Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.116
– Come here. Come to Daddy.
– Jinxy!

11:39.283 --> 11:42.119
Come on.
Taught him that in one week.

11:42.286 --> 11:46.623
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.
Jinxy, say hello to Greg.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.041
– Wave to Greg.
– Hello, Jinx.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.211
Attaboy.
That took me another week.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.131
– Oh, my gosh.
– Pam, I didn't know you had a cat.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.383
I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.552
Your daddy's found
his new best friend.

11:58.719 --> 12:02.472
You won't believe it.
He even taught him to use the potty.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.475
– He did? Dad, that's kinda weird.
– What's so weird about it?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.477
Now we don't have to smell kitty litter.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.687
– That's right.
– Right?

12:08.854 --> 12:11.940
That's incredible. How did you
teach the cat to use the toilet?

12:12.107 --> 12:13.358
Oh, that was easy, Greg.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.069
I just designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.739
and then once he got used to it,
I took it away.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.241
– Yeah, makes sense.
– I don't think he likes it.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.661
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig, squat and bury.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.331
I had to move
all my potted plants off the floor.

12:27.497 --> 12:31.043
Plus, you got another guy around
the house to leave the seat up.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.839
He can't lift the seat, Greg.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.175
He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs.

12:38.342 --> 12:42.512
Ah, right. Opposable…
I didn't think about that.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.764
Jinx is strictly a house cat.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.558
Can't let him outside because
he lacks outdoor survival skills.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.685
One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?

12:48.852 --> 12:52.689
I don't think Greg will be playing
with Jinxy too much. He hates cats.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.693
Pam, I don't hate cats.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.696
I don't hate cats. I just happen
to be more of a dog lover.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.907
– Yeah, yeah.
– I am too.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.617
Well, that's OK
if you hate cats, Greg.

13:03.784 --> 13:07.120
No! I don't.
I don't hate cats at all.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.458
That's OK. Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.461
I… I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.966
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.550
Greg, you come with me.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.553
We'll get you something to wear
from Jack's closet, OK?

13:23.720 --> 13:26.056
– OK.
– Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.685
– Yeah?
– I'm so happy you're home, sweetheart.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.020
Me too, Daddy.

13:34.231 --> 13:39.361
Hey, listen, be nice to this one,
OK? I kinda like him.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.739
– OK, I'll try.
– Thank you.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.417
– Shirt fit OK, Greg?
– Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.460
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.088
You know, I wish you hadn't
told your parents I hate cats.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.506
But you do hate cats.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.675
You didn't have to tell them
right when we met.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.677
I know. I'm sorry.
It just kinda slipped out.

14:03.844 --> 14:08.432
Get your red-hot pu-pus.
My goodness, what is that?

14:08.598 --> 14:13.854
Oh, that's just a little something
from me. Go ahead. Open it up.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.566
Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.651
Oh, isn't that nice?

14:25.282 --> 14:29.286
Oh, look at this. It's a flowerpot
with the dirt in it.

14:30.662 --> 14:34.624
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

14:34.791 --> 14:38.211
The bulb of a Jerusalem tulip.

14:40.464 --> 14:45.510
Which I was told is one of the rarest
and most beautiful flowers in existence.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.890
Oh, right, right, the Jerusalem…

14:50.057 --> 14:53.518
…from the <i>jerusales tulipesias</i>
genus. Yes, yes.

14:54.644 --> 14:58.774
Anyway, yeah, the guy said
with regular watering,

14:58.940 --> 15:00.400
it should bloom in about
six months, so…

15:00.567 --> 15:03.236
Oh, we'll look forward to that, Greg.

15:12.037 --> 15:14.748
So, Greg, how's your job?

15:14.915 --> 15:18.376
Good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.255
I… I recently
got transferred to triage.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.257
Oh, is that better than a nurse?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.427
No, Mom, triage is a unit of the E.R.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.721
– It's where all the top nurses work.
– Well…

15:29.888 --> 15:32.015
No, they do.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.644
Not many men in your profession,
though, are there, Greg?

15:37.354 --> 15:40.357
No, Jack, not traditionally.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.488
Oh, Pam, honey, did you know that
your father started his own business?

15:46.655 --> 15:50.033
– Really? Dad, that's great.
– Oh, wow!

15:50.200 --> 15:52.452
Yes, I thought with
my knowledge and experience,

15:52.619 --> 15:54.454
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?

15:54.621 --> 15:57.123
– I really admire that.
– Yeah.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.876
So what is it?
What's the new venture?

16:00.043 --> 16:04.422
Let me ask you a question, Greg.
Let's just say you have kids

16:04.589 --> 16:08.426
and you wanna get out of the house,
spend a night on the town. You know?

16:08.593 --> 16:11.138
So you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think you can trust.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.057
References, work experience…
it all checks out fine.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.227
But then how do you
really know for certain

16:17.394 --> 16:20.564
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?

16:20.730 --> 16:24.401
I mean, can you ever really trust
another human being, Greg?

16:27.154 --> 16:31.616
– Sure, I think so.
– No, the answer is you cannot.

16:33.577 --> 16:38.039
Let me show you something.
Take a look at this, Greg.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.253
What's this look like to you?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.173
This looks like a teddy bear.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.551
Smile, you're on «nanny camera.»

16:50.510 --> 16:53.221
Oh, yeah, yeah! I've seen
these things advertised on TV.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.932
Oh, no, not like this, you haven't.
Take a look.

16:57.392 --> 17:01.271
Oh, my gosh. Hi!
Where's the other camera?

17:01.438 --> 17:04.107
Right here in this decorative artifact.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.444
– Wow, that's great.
– Our cameras are motion-activated,

17:07.611 --> 17:10.030
so they begin taping as soon
as they sense any movement.

17:10.195 --> 17:14.284
We can hide 'em in anything. Mirrors,
lamps, televisions, you name it.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.536
So no matter where you go…

17:17.537 --> 17:19.789
…we'll be watching you.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.961
So, Jack, couldn't this maybe
be construed as illegal?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.546
You know, invasion of privacy?

17:28.173 --> 17:31.134
Trust me, Greg, when you start
having little Fockers running around,

17:31.301 --> 17:33.428
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.

17:39.643 --> 17:40.894
Impressive, isn't it?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.062
Quite.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.275
– Oh, I'll get that.
– I'll get it. Honey, I'll get it.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.361
OK.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.031
Any problem with the documents?

17:53.198 --> 17:56.826
OK. I'll meet you at the Oyster Bay
drugstore in about 20 minutes.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.496
Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.040
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent

18:02.207 --> 18:04.376
and ask for the vegetarian special, OK?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.004
Wow. All this
and the wedding's on Sunday?

18:08.171 --> 18:12.008
– Oh, that wasn't the airline, was it?
– Nope, wrong number.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.595
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make a run to the store.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.973
That's funny.
I thought I just bought some.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.434
You know how that stuff,
it just goes, so I'll be back in a jiff.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.853
Well, why doesn't Greg go with you?

18:25.981 --> 18:29.484
Sweetie, you'll need something in case
your suitcase doesn't show up.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.112
– Oh, I'm sure it'll show up.
– Yeah.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.906
You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.409
– Go on, sweetie.
– Yeah.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.203
OK, unless you want some privacy.

18:41.162 --> 18:46.126
– Why would I need privacy?
– No, I didn't think you would.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.545
– OK, let's head out.
– Oh, good.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.715
Bye.

18:51.881 --> 18:56.011
Have fun, you guys.
Pam, he seems wonderful.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.806
– He is. We have the best time together.
– Good.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.641
Now, have you two been…?

19:02.809 --> 19:05.395
– Mother!
– Thinking about anything permanent.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.982
Oh, I don't know. I mean,
we haven't really discussed it,

19:09.149 --> 19:11.943
but I definitely
have a feeling this is it.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.905
Dad seems to like him.
Don't you think?

19:16.072 --> 19:18.074
Absolutely.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.415
– Big day, Saturday.
– This car…

19:25.582 --> 19:28.877
Yes. This car is…

19:30.920 --> 19:33.506
You got… What do you use?
Unleaded? Regular unleaded?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.133
Premium.

19:40.096 --> 19:44.559
Hey, you know, Jack, now that
we have a second to talk,

19:44.726 --> 19:48.104
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.231
I know that we haven't
been together that long,

19:50.398 --> 19:54.611
but the time that we have spent
together has been really incredible.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.362
Greg, how come you don't like cats?

19:59.741 --> 20:04.746
I don't not like cats.
I just… I just prefer dogs.

20:04.913 --> 20:08.249
I mean, I'm just more
of a dog kind of, you know…

20:08.917 --> 20:14.130
Come home, wagging their little tails,
happy to see you kind of…

20:14.297 --> 20:18.968
You need that assurance, do you? You
prefer an emotionally shallow animal?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.970
I…

20:21.137 --> 20:23.431
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,

20:23.598 --> 20:25.934
his tail will go between his legs
and cover his genitals,

20:26.101 --> 20:27.560
his ears will go down.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.897
A dog is very easy to break, but cats
make you work for their affection.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.774
They don't sell out the way dogs do.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.326
You like Peter, Paul and Mary?

20:46.079 --> 20:49.416
Yes, I do. I'm a big fan.

20:56.172 --> 21:00.385
– Great song.
– Yeah, one of my favorites.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.638
Who would've thought it wasn't
really about a dragon, huh?

21:05.348 --> 21:06.933
What do you mean?

21:08.309 --> 21:11.020
You know, the whole drug thing.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.858
No, I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

21:17.318 --> 21:20.530
Some people think that…

21:21.656 --> 21:24.033
…to «Puff the Magic Dragon»
means to…

21:24.200 --> 21:25.618
They're really…

21:27.704 --> 21:30.415
To smoke… to smoke…

21:30.582 --> 21:33.543
A marijuana cigarette.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.380
Well, Puff's just the name
of the boy's magical dragon.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.508
Right.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.389
– Are you a pothead, Focker?
– No! No.

21:46.556 --> 21:50.727
What? No, no, no, no, Jack.
No, I'm, I'm not… I…

21:50.894 --> 21:53.396
I pass on grass all the time.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.565
– I mean, not all the time.
– Yes or no, Greg?

21:55.732 --> 21:57.108
No. Yes. No.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.577
Look, Greg, I'll meet you back
out front in about 12 to 15 minutes.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.704
OK.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.934
– Hey. Hi.
– Hey. How you doing? Hey.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.478
Do you have any of those
nicotine patches?

22:34.729 --> 22:36.898
No. We have the gum.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.111
– Great.
– You chew it.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.615
Thank you. Yes, OK. And what's your
most expensive bottle of champagne?

22:45.782 --> 22:48.910
Mumm's. It's on sale for 13.95.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.954
Really? That's it?
You don't have, like,

22:51.120 --> 22:53.790
a nice, like, 80 or $100 bottle
of something?

22:55.708 --> 22:57.752
You can get
a whole bunch of Mumm's.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.914
– Focker.
– Hey, Jack. Ready to go?

23:35.081 --> 23:39.210
I've been ready, yeah.
They ran out of Collins mix.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.841
– You been waiting here long?
– No, I was just reading up about…

23:47.176 --> 23:50.471
– …pumps.
– Pumps?

23:50.638 --> 23:54.017
Yes. Breast pumps.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.646
I grew up on a farm.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.030
Get your hot buns, hot patooties.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.866
Wow, Dina,
everything looks fabulous.

24:10.033 --> 24:13.369
It's such a treat for me to have
a home-cooked meal like this.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.872
Dinner at my house usually consisted
of everybody in the kitchen

24:16.039 --> 24:17.874
fighting over containers
of Chinese food.

24:18.041 --> 24:21.794
You poor thing. What, there
wasn't enough food to go around?

24:21.961 --> 24:26.174
No, there was. We just never really
sat down like a family like this.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.136
Greg, would you like to say grace?

24:31.512 --> 24:34.057
Oh, well, Greg's Jewish, Dad.
You know that.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.976
You're telling me Jews
don't pray, honey?

24:38.061 --> 24:41.773
– Unless you have some objection.
– No, no, no, no, I'd love to.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.858
Pam, come on, it's not like
I'm a rabbi or something.

24:44.025 --> 24:47.403
I've said grace at many a dinner table.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.077
Let's…

24:56.412 --> 24:57.747
OK.

25:00.708 --> 25:04.253
O dear God…

25:06.422 --> 25:08.007
…thank you.

25:09.592 --> 25:13.930
You are such a good God to us,
a kind and gentle…

25:14.097 --> 25:19.560
…and accommodating God.

25:19.727 --> 25:24.899
And we thank you, O sweet,
sweet Lord of hosts…

25:25.066 --> 25:26.943
…for the…

25:28.736 --> 25:32.115
…smorgasbord you have so aptly

25:32.281 --> 25:35.284
lain at our table this day…

25:35.451 --> 25:39.247
…and each day… by day.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.043
Day by day by day.

25:45.461 --> 25:50.925
O dear Lord, three things we pray.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.637
To love Thee more dearly,

25:54.804 --> 25:59.267
to see Thee more clearly,

25:59.434 --> 26:02.812
to follow Thee more nearly…

26:02.979 --> 26:06.983
…day by day… by day.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.651
– Amen.
– Amen.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.320
Oh, Greg, that was lovely.

26:11.487 --> 26:15.241
Thank you, Greg.
That was interesting, too.

26:22.039 --> 26:26.669
Oh, that's a… That's a lovely vase.
That's great.

26:26.836 --> 26:30.590
Let me guess, Jack. Is that
one of your secret cameras, too?

26:33.885 --> 26:38.598
Greg, Greg. That's an urn which holds
the remains of Jack's mother.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.352
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.438
That's all right.
You didn't know, Greg.

26:45.605 --> 26:48.691
– I'm…
– That's our gran-gran.

26:48.858 --> 26:53.196
We like to think of her
as watching over us as we eat.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.698
Love you, Ma. Miss you.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.575
Miss you every day.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.995
Oh, honey, why don't you
read Greg your poem?

27:01.162 --> 27:03.206
Oh, no, he doesn't want to hear that.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.208
What? No! What-what-what poem?

27:05.374 --> 27:08.044
You see, when Jack had to retire

27:08.211 --> 27:10.713
– for health reasons…
– That's a bunch of malarky. I'm fine.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.716
The doctor thought it would be
therapeutic if he

27:13.883 --> 27:16.177
sort of expressed his emotions
in an artistic way.

27:16.344 --> 27:20.389
Honey, you wrote the most beautiful
poem about your mother.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.391
Please, we really wanna hear it.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.061
– Poem, poem.
– Please!

27:25.228 --> 27:29.065
Oh, all right.
It's a work in progress.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.526
I'm still not happy with it.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.903
As soon as it's ready,

27:34.070 --> 27:37.865
then I am going to glaze it
onto a plate

27:38.032 --> 27:40.076
– and put it next to the urn.
– Nice.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.036
It's very special.

27:42.203 --> 27:46.415
<i>My Mother</i> by Jack Byrnes.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.920
«You gave me life, you gave me milk

27:51.087 --> 27:53.214
You gave me courage

27:53.381 --> 27:59.178
Your name was Angela
the angel from heaven

27:59.345 --> 28:03.349
But you were also an angel of God
and he needed you too

28:03.516 --> 28:06.727
Selfishly I tried to keep you here

28:06.894 --> 28:09.438
While the cancer ate away your organs

28:09.605 --> 28:11.774
Like an unstoppable rebel force.

28:11.941 --> 28:17.613
But I couldn't save you
and I shall see your face…

28:17.780 --> 28:21.909
Nevermore, nevermore

28:22.076 --> 28:24.787
Nevermore…

28:24.954 --> 28:29.125
Until we meet… in heaven»

28:30.710 --> 28:32.795
Daddy, that's beautiful.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.965
– It always gets me.
– Amazing. So…

28:36.132 --> 28:40.720
So much love, yet also
so much information.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.223
It takes a lot out of him.

28:46.142 --> 28:50.229
– Greg, would you like some yams?
– Thank you. Oh, yeah.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.566
You must've had vegetables fresher
than that, growing up on a farm, Greg.

28:53.733 --> 28:57.320
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.405
He told me he grew up on a farm.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.536
– Do they have many farms in Detroit?
– No, Dina, no, not a lot.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.580
In fact, Jack, I should clarify this.

29:07.747 --> 29:11.834
I didn't actually grow up…
on a farm per se.

29:12.001 --> 29:15.463
The house we grew up in
was originally erected

29:15.630 --> 29:18.674
in the early Dutch farm, Colonial style.

29:18.841 --> 29:22.428
So that, plus we had a lot of pets…

29:25.348 --> 29:28.225
– Which one did you milk then?
– Dad!

29:28.392 --> 29:33.648
– Honey, he said he pumped milk.
– What have you ever milked?

29:35.983 --> 29:38.152
A cat.

29:38.319 --> 29:41.155
A cat?

29:41.322 --> 29:42.698
I milked a cat once.

29:42.865 --> 29:46.535
– You wanna hear a story?
– Sure.

29:46.702 --> 29:52.208
My sister had a cat, and the cat
birthed a litter of kittens.

29:52.375 --> 29:55.294
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was this one little runt…

29:55.461 --> 29:58.547
this little sweet little…
little-engine-that-could runt

29:58.714 --> 30:02.343
who wanted to get up there and couldn't
really get access to the… to the…

30:02.510 --> 30:05.972
…to the… to the… to the teat.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.848
Teat?

30:08.015 --> 30:09.850
– Dad.
– What have you.

30:10.017 --> 30:15.398
I went in and just simply,
you know, just…

30:18.984 --> 30:21.904
…into a little saucer,

30:22.071 --> 30:26.867
then took the saucer and fed it
to Geppetto… that's what I named him.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.745
I had… I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.248
Oh, yeah, you can milk
anything with nipples.

30:35.418 --> 30:37.753
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?

30:37.920 --> 30:40.756
OK, could we change
the subject perhaps?

30:42.591 --> 30:44.385
– Champagne, champagne.
– Yes.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.595
Maybe we could celebrate
with a little bubbly.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.265
That'd be great. Good idea.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.942
«I have nipples. Can you milk me?»

31:00.109 --> 31:03.446
Well, in a funny way,
you've already seen Deb's ring.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.740
That's true.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.742
Would anybody care for a bottle

31:07.908 --> 31:10.953
of Oyster Bay Drug and Sundries
finest champagne?

31:11.120 --> 31:14.623
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

31:14.790 --> 31:16.208
That's very nice.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.919
How could I have seen Debbie's ring?
I haven't been home for months.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.797
Well, when I gave Bob
the OK to propose to Deb,

31:21.964 --> 31:23.966
I put him in touch with my diamond guy,

31:24.133 --> 31:26.761
and he picked out
the same design Kevin gave you.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.724
– Kevin, your old boyfriend?
– Thanks, Dad.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.143
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fiance.

31:41.484 --> 31:45.446
Oh, my God. Jinxy, no!

31:46.489 --> 31:47.490
Jinxy, no!

31:47.656 --> 31:49.700
Oh, God.

31:51.118 --> 31:51.952
Shit.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.999
– Greg, sweetie, how you doing?
– Oh, just fine,

31:57.166 --> 32:00.336
considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,

32:00.503 --> 32:04.548
found out you were engaged and
had your father ask me to milk him.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.926
At least back then he was
still talking to me.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.595
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you were that close.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.681
– Who, Daddy and me?
– No, Kevin and you.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.683
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?

32:14.850 --> 32:19.522
You never told me about
your cat-milking days in Motown.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.440
That was a long time ago, Pam.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.734
Yeah, OK, well, so was this.

32:23.901 --> 32:29.698
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical than anything else.

32:29.865 --> 32:33.953
Physical? Like what?
Like you worked out together?

32:34.119 --> 32:39.542
No, no, it was nothing, nothing.
It was a stupid sexual thing.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.836
I'm gonna go throw up now.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.673
Greg, listen. Kevin and I
were only engaged for a month

32:45.840 --> 32:47.967
before I realized
that I'd made a mistake, OK?

32:48.134 --> 32:50.928
I… I… I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,

32:51.095 --> 32:54.557
and I met and fell in love with you,
OK, so can we please drop this?

32:56.392 --> 32:58.727
– OK.
– Good.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.938
I just feel like this is
not going well at all.

33:01.105 --> 33:04.400
– I feel like your dad hates me.
– He doesn't hate you, sweetie.

33:04.567 --> 33:07.278
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.280
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

33:09.446 --> 33:13.868
I thought he would love my gift,
you know, being this big flower guy,

33:14.034 --> 33:17.246
but it's like he didn't even show
the slightest bit of interest.

33:17.413 --> 33:21.250
Listen to me. Forget the gift.

33:21.417 --> 33:25.921
You are the most adorable, loving,
sweetest man in the whole world,

33:26.088 --> 33:28.424
and I love you.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.926
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that,

33:31.093 --> 33:34.930
and grow to love you too, OK? OK?

33:37.558 --> 33:40.269
Speaking of growing to love you…

33:40.436 --> 33:42.605
– Honey, it's late. Come on.
– I know it's late.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.858
But Mr. Winky is still on Chicago time,

33:46.025 --> 33:49.278
and we both know there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.

33:49.445 --> 33:50.821
Greg?

33:51.447 --> 33:54.617
And there it is.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.372
What's with the robe?

34:00.539 --> 34:04.126
It's Pam's. My pajamas are in
the suitcase with everything else.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.754
Hey, I'll lend you a pair of Jack's.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.464
– OK, honey?
– Sure.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.299
– You don't have to do that, Dina.
– Oh, no, no.

34:10.466 --> 34:12.134
No, that's fine. We have to.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.969
– Thank you.
– You're welcome.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.514
Look, Greg, I just wanna say, don't
worry about what happened tonight.

34:19.475 --> 34:23.520
Oh, well, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible. I mean…

34:24.563 --> 34:26.398
Well, it was a horrible thing.

34:29.944 --> 34:34.156
But let's just put all that behind us
and enjoy our weekend together.

34:35.282 --> 34:38.744
– OK. OK.
– Thank you, Daddy.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.164
– Oh, thank you.
– Thanks, Mom.

34:42.331 --> 34:43.998
– These'll do just fine.
– Good night.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.502
Night-night. Why'd you give him
my favorite pair?

34:46.668 --> 34:49.463
– Good night. See you in the morning.
– Good night.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.007
– Have a nice sleep.
– OK, you too.

34:52.174 --> 34:56.844
Oh, no, no, no, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you down in the den.

34:57.513 --> 35:01.850
Oh, OK, 'cause Pam said
I should sleep in Debbie's room.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.145
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.439
This way, you'll have more privacy,
you'll have your own bathroom.

35:07.648 --> 35:11.193
Just try not to flush the toilet.
It's always a little quirky.

35:11.360 --> 35:15.030
– OK.
– Oh, one more thing.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.618
I'm a realist. I understand
it's the 21st century,

35:19.785 --> 35:23.706
and you've probably had premarital
relations with my daughter.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.376
But under our roof, it's my way
or the Long Island Expressway.

35:27.543 --> 35:30.713
– Is that understood?
– Of course, yeah.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.882
Good. Keep your snake
in its cage for 72 hours.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.094
OK.

35:41.765 --> 35:45.060
<i>Welcome to Atlantic American Airways'
lost luggage department.</i>

35:45.227 --> 35:48.897
<i>At Atlantic American Airways, customer
satisfaction always comes first.</i>

35:49.064 --> 35:51.108
<i>We are experiencing heavy call volume.</i>

35:51.275 --> 35:53.235
<i>Because your call
is very important to us,</i>

35:53.402 --> 35:56.405
<i>it will be answered
in approximately 27 minutes.</i>

35:56.572 --> 35:59.575
<i>Please press «1» if you'd like

35:59.742 --> 36:02.536
<i>We are closed for the night.
Please call back…</i>

36:08.083 --> 36:10.085
Sorry.

36:12.796 --> 36:16.592
I don't know what it is, but there's
something about him that's a little off.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.428
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Jack,
you know we've been through this

36:19.595 --> 36:24.475
with every boyfriend Pam has had
since, what, middle school.

36:24.641 --> 36:28.604
I think Greg…
He's a lovely young man.

36:28.771 --> 36:31.774
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.903
She said that?
She said those exact words?

36:36.070 --> 36:39.114
I didn't tape record it, Jack,
but that's the impression.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.369
I just feel sorry, the poor boy
never had a home-cooked meal.

36:43.535 --> 36:47.289
What kind of a family doesn't have time
to sit down for dinner?

36:47.456 --> 36:51.293
– Fugitives.
– Please try to enjoy the weekend.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.963
– Both our daughters are in love.
– That's what I'm worried about.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.637
– Oh, geez, I just realized something.
– What?

37:01.804 --> 37:04.181
– Pam's middle name.
– Martha.

37:05.307 --> 37:07.142
Oh, no.

37:07.309 --> 37:08.852
Pamela Martha Focker.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.206
«Operation Ko Samui»?

38:20.716 --> 38:22.259
Looking for something, Greg?

38:23.886 --> 38:26.555
Jesus, Jack, you scared me.

38:26.722 --> 38:30.559
I heard a noise, so I came down
to see if everything was OK.

38:30.726 --> 38:32.477
Everything's fine.
I just… I'm sorry.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.438
I saw a light on,
and I kinda stumbled in.

38:34.605 --> 38:37.858
– I didn't realize…
– That's OK. See anything interesting?

38:38.025 --> 38:41.403
No, not at all. I mean, I mean…

38:41.570 --> 38:46.033
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this… It's a cozy little nook.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.410
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.749
– Yeah.
– It's an antique polygraph machine.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.585
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,

38:56.752 --> 38:58.712
but I never saw one actually up close.

38:58.879 --> 39:00.714
You know what?

39:02.758 --> 39:04.218
Why don't you try that on?

39:05.260 --> 39:06.929
Oh, that's OK.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.057
Oh, come on. We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.

39:10.224 --> 39:12.726
– I… I shouldn't.
– Why should you be afraid?

39:12.893 --> 39:14.770
– You have nothing to hide.
– No, I know.

39:14.937 --> 39:17.773
– So there shouldn't be any problem.
– No, there's no problem.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.485
– So, try it on.
– OK.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.153
I'll help you.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.455
Don't worry. You'll enjoy this.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.876
All right.

39:38.961 --> 39:43.298
Looks complicated. Now, these aren't
100 percent accurate, right? They're…

39:43.465 --> 39:46.134
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.804
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.266
Now I'm gonna ask you some questions,

39:52.432 --> 39:54.643
and all you have to do
is answer «yes» or «no.»

39:54.810 --> 39:59.147
– OK.
– All right. Let's give it a whirl.

40:00.691 --> 40:04.361
– Did you fly on an airplane today?
– Yes, I did.

40:05.654 --> 40:08.115
No peeking. Did we eat pot roast

40:08.282 --> 40:11.827
– for dinner tonight?
– Yes.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.912
Was it under-cooked?

40:17.165 --> 40:22.170
No, it was rare.
It was a little rare for my taste.

40:23.130 --> 40:26.633
– But I wouldn't…
– I'm just kidding, I'm just…

40:29.553 --> 40:32.306
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.

40:34.141 --> 40:37.644
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

40:43.900 --> 40:44.943
No.

40:46.653 --> 40:49.698
– I mean, well, I don't…
– Yes or no?

40:58.749 --> 41:02.753
– Hey!
– Hey.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.383
What's the matter? You can't sleep?

41:08.550 --> 41:10.969
No, no, I'm just going over
some of my answers

41:11.136 --> 41:13.221
from the polygraph test
your dad just gave me.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.016
– Oh, no, he didn't.
– Yeah, he did.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.393
Well, did you lie to him?

41:18.560 --> 41:21.688
No! I mean… Well, he asked me
if we were living together,

41:21.855 --> 41:24.274
– and…
– What'd you tell him?

41:24.441 --> 41:26.360
I… nothing.
Your mother walked in

41:26.526 --> 41:28.570
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.

41:29.196 --> 41:30.697
This how you'd react if I told you

41:30.864 --> 41:32.908
he shoved bamboo shoots
up my fingernails?

41:33.075 --> 41:37.329
Or does he hook all your boyfriends
up to his little machine?

41:37.537 --> 41:40.665
Well, he doesn't need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.417
What?

41:42.584 --> 41:45.420
Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.

41:45.587 --> 41:48.423
That was just his cover.

41:48.590 --> 41:51.426
He was in the CIA for 34 years.

41:51.593 --> 41:54.513
How could you not tell me this?

41:54.721 --> 41:59.101
I wanted to, honey, but it was strictly
on a «need-to-know» basis.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.607
So, what? He's in the CIA?
He was a spy? He is a spy?

42:05.774 --> 42:08.110
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.

42:08.276 --> 42:11.321
They used him to interrogate suspected
double agents in the company.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.323
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.992
I was scared of your dad back
when I thought he was a florist.

42:16.159 --> 42:19.287
It's wonderful to know I've actually got
a CIA spy-hunter on my ass.

42:19.454 --> 42:23.291
Would you stop?
You're doing great, OK?

42:23.458 --> 42:26.461
This is a lot to take in, honey.
I'm sorry.

42:26.628 --> 42:30.632
– It's just weird.
– Oh, I know, but you're doing fine.

42:30.799 --> 42:33.677
I promise.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.853
– No, no!
– What's wrong, sweetie?

42:43.019 --> 42:46.481
I forgot. I'm not supposed
to let the snake out of my cage.

42:47.649 --> 42:48.984
– Your what?
– I told your dad

42:49.151 --> 42:50.485
I wouldn't touch you for 72 hours.

42:50.652 --> 42:53.655
– I'm not in junior high anymore, so…
– No, no, no.

42:53.822 --> 42:56.742
Seriously. I want to try
to respect his rules, OK?

42:56.908 --> 42:59.453
OK. Fine.

42:59.619 --> 43:03.665
Why don't you go ahead and get some
sleep, and I'll see you in the morning.

43:03.832 --> 43:05.208
OK.

43:16.803 --> 43:20.515
– Morning, Greg.
– Good morning.

43:20.682 --> 43:24.686
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret of mine last night.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.564
Yes, she did.

43:28.732 --> 43:31.401
As long as you can keep your
mouth shut for the rest of your life,

43:31.568 --> 43:33.987
you're in no immediate danger.

43:35.864 --> 43:37.741
I won't tell.

43:38.909 --> 43:40.869
I'm just being humorous.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.914
That was funny.

43:45.665 --> 43:48.710
But the fact is, Greg, with
the knowledge you've been given,

43:48.877 --> 43:51.880
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

43:52.047 --> 43:55.842
«the Byrnes family circle of trust.»

43:56.009 --> 43:58.803
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me,

43:58.970 --> 44:04.893
– and round and round we go.
– OK. Understood.

44:07.771 --> 44:10.565
OK, good. Come on.
Let's go inside and have breakfast.

44:15.862 --> 44:19.533
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
Where are you</i>

44:19.699 --> 44:22.410
<i>I love you</i>

44:22.577 --> 44:26.081
Jinxy. Jinxy.

44:26.248 --> 44:28.416
Not at the table, honey, please.

44:28.583 --> 44:32.921
– Attaboy!
– Hey, hey, look who's up!

44:33.088 --> 44:34.589
– Hi, sweetie.
– You must be Greg.

44:34.756 --> 44:37.133
– Hello.
– Oh, look, somebody had

44:37.300 --> 44:39.427
a visit from the hair fairy.

44:39.594 --> 44:43.265
– Oh, yes.
– Nice 'do, nice 'do.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.600
I'll do the intros.
Greg, this is my sister, Debbie.

44:45.767 --> 44:48.228
– Hi. Nice to meet you.
– The bride-to-be. Congratulations.

44:48.395 --> 44:52.274
– And her fiance, Dr. Bob.
– You can call me Bob… M.D.

44:52.649 --> 44:56.152
– These are his parents, Linda Banks…
– Hi. How are you?

44:56.319 --> 44:59.614
…and the world-famous
plastic surgeon, Dr. Larry.

44:59.781 --> 45:01.950
Whoa, now, cut that out.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.662
You know, Greg's
in medicine, too, Larry.

45:05.829 --> 45:08.665
– Oh, really? What field?
– Nursing.

45:10.417 --> 45:13.795
– That's good.
– No, really. What field?

45:14.671 --> 45:16.631
Nursing.

45:20.343 --> 45:23.138
Hey, why don't I get you
a chair, Greg?

45:23.305 --> 45:25.682
Thank you. Thanks.

45:25.849 --> 45:28.685
So, you didn't want
to go for the M.D.?

45:28.852 --> 45:32.814
No, I actually thought about becoming a
doctor, but I decided it wasn't for me.

45:32.981 --> 45:34.816
Just as well. Boards are killer.

45:34.983 --> 45:37.652
Actually Greg aced his MCATs.

45:37.819 --> 45:39.988
– You serious?
– No, I did OK.

45:40.155 --> 45:42.324
Oh, he did more than OK. Trust me.

45:42.490 --> 45:45.452
Why did you take the test if you weren't
planning on going to med school?

45:45.619 --> 45:47.579
Well, I wanted to keep my options open,

45:47.787 --> 45:49.706
but in the end,
nursing was a better fit for me.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.667
It gives you the freedom to work
in several different areas of medicine.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.794
Plus, I can focus
100 percent on patient care,

45:54.961 --> 45:57.297
as opposed to being a doctor where
you have to deal with the bureaucracy.

45:57.464 --> 46:00.133
Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

46:00.300 --> 46:02.135
Oh, my God!
I thought Deb told you.

46:02.302 --> 46:05.847
Dr. Andy threw out his back.
He can't make the wedding.

46:06.014 --> 46:09.059
Oh, damn. Now I have
to reconfigure the whole procession.

46:09.225 --> 46:13.980
Bob, why doesn't Greg stand in
for Andy, be the usher?

46:14.147 --> 46:17.192
– No, Pam, no.
– That'll be fine.

46:17.359 --> 46:19.319
Bob, Greg'll be your second usher.

46:19.486 --> 46:23.406
– Good.
– Yeah. Yeah, yeah, OK, sure.

46:23.573 --> 46:27.202
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go

46:27.369 --> 46:29.788
because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.

46:29.954 --> 46:30.955
Thirty-two minutes!

46:31.164 --> 46:34.000
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

46:34.167 --> 46:36.878
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.

46:41.091 --> 46:43.051
Dina, thank you so much
for breakfast.

46:47.263 --> 46:50.225
– Hey, you OK?
– Why didn't you wake me up?

46:50.392 --> 46:52.185
I thought you'd like to sleep late.

46:52.352 --> 46:54.187
Not when I'm a guest
in somebody's house.

46:54.354 --> 46:56.648
– It's OK. Don't worry about it.
– No, it's not OK.

46:56.856 --> 46:59.818
Tell that to Dr. Torquemada
in there with the grand inquisition.

46:59.985 --> 47:02.404
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.

47:02.570 --> 47:05.782
– Get dressed in what?
– Borrow some more of dad's clothes.

47:05.949 --> 47:08.451
– No, I don't… come on.
– Why not, honey?

47:08.618 --> 47:12.288
I just… No, I don't feel comfortable
wearing your dad's underwear.

47:12.455 --> 47:15.250
OK, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

47:15.417 --> 47:17.252
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met,

47:17.419 --> 47:19.462
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?

47:20.922 --> 47:22.924
OK, all right.

47:23.091 --> 47:25.760
– Where's Denny's room?
– Top of the stairs, turn right.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.226
Denny?

47:37.105 --> 47:38.940
Denny?

47:39.858 --> 47:41.276
Denny?

47:43.194 --> 47:45.280
Hello? Hello?

47:58.835 --> 48:01.337
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What the hell you doing in here?

48:01.504 --> 48:03.798
I'm… I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.009
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?

48:06.176 --> 48:10.138
No, dude, no. No, no,
she said I could come up here,

48:10.305 --> 48:12.265
– maybe borrow some clothes from you.
– Do me a favor. Close the door.

48:12.432 --> 48:14.267
– OK.
– Quick.

48:15.935 --> 48:19.481
– Tell anybody I wasn't here?
– No, they think you're asleep.

48:19.647 --> 48:23.151
– Yeah, so, it's all good.
– You scared me.

48:30.200 --> 48:33.328
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?

48:33.495 --> 48:35.288
No, it's not that bad.

48:35.455 --> 48:38.249
Your little Pamcake's got it
a lot worse than I do, you know?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.960
You need some clothes.

48:41.127 --> 48:43.421
Yes, that would be…
That would be great.

48:43.630 --> 48:46.591
– Glad to hook you up. All right?
– Cool.

48:46.758 --> 48:49.719
Like what you done with the crib.

48:51.596 --> 48:55.016
Oh, Lil' Kim. She's phat.

48:59.813 --> 49:01.815
P-h phat.

49:01.981 --> 49:03.900
I think these oughta do it.
Here you go, chief.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.902
– All right!
– Enjoy!

49:06.069 --> 49:08.029
– Thanks a lot, Denny.
– No problem.

49:08.196 --> 49:11.991
Oh, and don't worry about
the little covert op, all right?

49:12.158 --> 49:14.160
– I'll keep it on the lowdown.
– Down low.

49:14.327 --> 49:15.537
No doubt.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.708
People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.

49:20.875 --> 49:25.046
Larry, Linda, Debbie, Bob, honey.

49:25.213 --> 49:29.217
Now, I'm gonna activate the alarm.
It'll go off in T minus 16 seconds.

49:29.384 --> 49:31.427
– I don't think I need a jacket.
– It's cold out, honey.

49:31.594 --> 49:34.722
Hold on. Here, take Denny's jacket.

49:38.226 --> 49:41.187
– Denny, I'm lending Greg your jacket.
– Whatever.

49:41.354 --> 49:44.566
– Let's go.
– Hurry, hurry. We're going to be late.

49:44.732 --> 49:46.484
– Who is ready for the tux shop?
– Oh, fuck…

49:56.411 --> 49:58.913
Denny, how's the tux fit?

49:59.080 --> 50:01.958
– Dad…
– What's that?

50:02.125 --> 50:04.711
It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

50:08.131 --> 50:11.259
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device for smoking marijuana.

50:12.427 --> 50:14.387
Really?

50:16.055 --> 50:19.434
Not mine. It's not.

50:22.437 --> 50:24.230
Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?

50:27.066 --> 50:31.946
– I like the top hat. Complements you.
– Can I talk to you for a minute?

50:37.076 --> 50:38.953
Sit down.

50:43.124 --> 50:46.836
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust to you, Greg?

50:47.879 --> 50:49.714
Yeah, I think I got it.

50:49.881 --> 50:52.425
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?

50:52.592 --> 50:54.928
I… I don't think so.

50:55.094 --> 50:58.348
Didn't we have a discussion
yesterday in the car about this?

50:59.474 --> 51:01.643
Oh, yes! You mean… yes!

51:01.809 --> 51:03.895
You mean me and Pam. Yes,
I'd love to talk to you about that.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.356
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.

51:06.522 --> 51:09.984
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice,

51:10.151 --> 51:11.986
but to put you right back
outside the circle.

51:12.153 --> 51:15.156
And once you're out, you're out.
There's no coming back.

51:16.866 --> 51:20.161
Well, I would definitely like
to stay inside the circle.

51:20.328 --> 51:22.455
Well, then, tell me the truth.

51:23.539 --> 51:24.540
OK.

51:28.962 --> 51:31.047
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

51:32.382 --> 51:34.801
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.

51:34.968 --> 51:38.346
That's what 19 months in a
Vietnamese prison camp will do to you.

51:38.513 --> 51:42.350
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.

51:42.517 --> 51:46.771
And if I find that you are trying
to corrupt my firstborn child,

51:46.938 --> 51:48.815
I will bring you down, baby.

51:48.982 --> 51:51.526
I will bring you down to Chinatown.

52:06.708 --> 52:09.335
Where are we? I thought
we were going to Kevin's house.

52:09.502 --> 52:12.839
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

52:13.006 --> 52:14.424
Wow!

52:14.590 --> 52:17.760
– Oh, this is a crazy house.
– Not bad, huh, Dad?

52:19.929 --> 52:23.558
Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal
purposes. People do that nowadays.

52:23.725 --> 52:26.311
This kid has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.521
Hey, you. Get in some
quality time with the boys?

52:28.688 --> 52:30.606
Yeah, it was fun.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.235
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

52:34.402 --> 52:38.281
Why would «B.B.Q.
at best man's» be weird?

52:38.448 --> 52:41.576
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.

52:41.743 --> 52:44.454
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

52:44.620 --> 52:48.583
– Kevin, your ex-fiance?
– Hey! Welcome, everybody.

52:49.417 --> 52:50.918
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?

52:55.089 --> 52:58.468
Well, they… they went
to lacrosse camp together,

52:58.634 --> 53:01.596
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

53:01.763 --> 53:03.765
Lacrosse camp?

53:04.640 --> 53:06.934
I was really lucky
I was able to salvage this wood

53:07.101 --> 53:09.312
from an old seamen's chapel
in Nantucket.

53:10.605 --> 53:13.608
– Wow! Kevin, the house is amazing.
– This is where the light comes in.

53:13.775 --> 53:15.610
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.

53:15.777 --> 53:18.821
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot and the pool is luke.

53:18.988 --> 53:21.074
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B.B.Q,

53:21.240 --> 53:23.326
– just follow me.
– All right, Kevo.

53:23.493 --> 53:25.161
– Right on schedule.
– Bring it on.

53:25.328 --> 53:27.330
It must cost a fortune
to heat this place.

53:27.497 --> 53:29.123
Wait till you see the rest of the house.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.959
OK. This way, everybody, out this way.

53:47.850 --> 53:49.393
– You OK, sweetie?
– Yeah.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.979
I'm really sorry. I don't know
why I thought you knew.

53:52.146 --> 53:53.981
It… It's not a big deal.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.651
If I can handle a weekend
without sex and cigarettes,

53:56.818 --> 54:00.321
I think I can handle an afternoon
with your ex-fiance.

54:00.488 --> 54:01.989
OK. Thank you.

54:02.156 --> 54:06.160
Now, for the floor that you're walking
on, I chose this Bolivian wormwood.

54:06.327 --> 54:09.747
I think it works well in here.
I have the Viking range here,

54:09.914 --> 54:12.834
and the twin sub-z's.
Yeah, they open up right there.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.710
Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

54:14.877 --> 54:17.296
– Yeah, kind of blend in.
– Great.

54:18.131 --> 54:22.009
– Are you a homeowner, Greg?
– No, no, I rent.

54:23.177 --> 54:26.848
So, things are going real, real well
for you at Neuberger, aren't they, Kevo?

54:27.014 --> 54:29.767
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.

54:29.934 --> 54:33.604
I got in early on some wireless IPOs.
The stuff just skyrocketed from there.

54:33.771 --> 54:34.856
Wow.

54:35.022 --> 54:37.191
What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?

54:37.358 --> 54:39.902
– I'm in health care.
– So you know what I'm talking about.

54:40.069 --> 54:42.780
There are a lot of Benjamins
to be made now with biotech stuff.

54:42.989 --> 54:45.408
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?

54:46.909 --> 54:47.994
I'd say strong…

54:49.245 --> 54:51.622
…to quite strong.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.791
You gotta strike while the iron's hot.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.835
Now's the time.

54:56.002 --> 55:00.214
– Greg's a male nurse.
– That's right. Thank you, Jack.

55:00.381 --> 55:04.719
Well, that's great. That's great
to give something back like that.

55:04.886 --> 55:06.762
I'd love to find time to do
volunteer work.

55:06.929 --> 55:09.473
Just the other day I saw
this golden retriever that…

55:09.682 --> 55:11.601
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really…

55:11.767 --> 55:14.228
It made me feel terrible. I wish
there was something I could do.

55:14.395 --> 55:17.940
Yeah, well, I get paid, but also
it feels, you know, good, too.

55:18.107 --> 55:20.276
So it's kind of… everybody wins.

55:20.443 --> 55:23.070
What are you…
You're like a Wall Street trader?

55:23.237 --> 55:24.697
– An investment guy?
– No.

55:24.864 --> 55:28.618
I mean, I don't like to be painted
with that brush. Yes, that's my day job.

55:30.077 --> 55:32.079
We have time?
We got time, don't we, Jack?

55:32.246 --> 55:35.291
I want to show you what I'm really
interested in. Come on. Let's go.

55:39.754 --> 55:42.256
Wow! It looks like somebody
got an «A» in wood shop.

55:44.467 --> 55:48.262
Yeah, it's always been kind of a hobby.
I whittled that out of beech wood.

55:48.429 --> 55:50.431
– It's beautiful.
– Yeah.

55:50.598 --> 55:53.226
– What got you into… «carpentering»?
– Carpentry?

55:54.477 --> 55:57.939
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.
He was a carpenter.

55:58.105 --> 56:00.775
I figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,

56:00.942 --> 56:02.610
who better than Christ?

56:07.281 --> 56:09.158
Greg's Jewish.

56:09.617 --> 56:11.452
– Are you?
– Yeah.

56:13.079 --> 56:16.123
Well, so was J.C.
Wow. You're in good company.

56:17.750 --> 56:18.751
Right.

56:20.795 --> 56:22.630
Well, I'm gonna head to the pool,

56:22.797 --> 56:24.799
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

56:26.467 --> 56:28.427
– Wow, he made a gift.
– Greg.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.972
I put a fresh coat of lacquer
on this this morning,

56:31.138 --> 56:32.890
so bear with me with the fumes.

56:34.976 --> 56:38.271
Wow. Kev.

56:38.437 --> 56:40.940
– Isn't that something?
– That's incredible.

56:41.107 --> 56:43.693
– Thank you.
– Roses. Deb's favorite.

56:43.859 --> 56:46.570
– Yes, right.
– The little holes are for candles.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.990
Exactly. And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.

56:49.156 --> 56:52.660
– They make a tiny birdbath.
– That's great.

56:52.827 --> 56:55.871
It's beautiful. What is it?

56:56.038 --> 57:00.585
It's an altar.
Or you might call it a chuppah.

57:02.628 --> 57:05.131
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

57:05.298 --> 57:07.508
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',

57:07.675 --> 57:10.011
and tomorrow Robert and Debra
will meet beneath it

57:10.177 --> 57:13.931
to become man and wife. And later,
when they purchase a home,

57:14.140 --> 57:16.017
maybe it will grace their garden.

57:16.183 --> 57:20.604
Well, that's my sappy, romantic idea.

57:23.232 --> 57:25.151
Must have taken forever to build.

57:25.318 --> 57:27.903
No, not too bad. About 70 hours.

57:28.070 --> 57:31.866
Which isn't bad, considering I carved it
all by hand from one piece of wood.

57:33.200 --> 57:38.039
<i>Hey, Kevo. 12:15. Time to start
the barbecue, big guy.</i>

57:38.205 --> 57:41.334
OK, Mr. B.
I better get back to playing host.

57:41.500 --> 57:45.004
OK, you guys, grab your suits,
and I'll meet you down at the pool.

57:45.171 --> 57:47.006
I'm gonna take a pass on the swimming.

57:47.173 --> 57:48.507
Oh, no, you can't.

57:48.674 --> 57:51.260
I don't even have a suit with me.
The airline lost my bag…

57:51.427 --> 57:53.888
<i>Pamcake, let's go.
Mom's got your suit here.</i>

57:54.055 --> 57:57.058
– Coming, Dad.
– You better get going.

57:58.601 --> 58:01.103
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.

58:01.270 --> 58:06.275
Thank you. And, by the way, she just
had the nicest things to say about you.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.153
– Really?
– Yeah.

58:11.238 --> 58:15.368
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.

58:15.534 --> 58:18.204
Boy, she is a tomcat.

58:23.584 --> 58:25.586
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.

58:25.753 --> 58:28.631
– I'm not gonna swim.
– I'm not taking no for an answer.

58:28.798 --> 58:33.427
Cold buffet is on the left,
wine and champagne on the right.

58:33.594 --> 58:35.971
Comin' through here.

58:45.940 --> 58:51.779
Yeah, that'd be Gre…
Hey, there he is! Get out here.

58:53.280 --> 58:56.117
G-man, we got salmon, we got
swordfish. What's it gonna be?

58:56.283 --> 59:01.789
How 'bout a little of both, K-Dog?
I'm pretty hungry.

59:01.956 --> 59:04.625
I think they call that the munchies.

59:07.002 --> 59:09.255
Let's go. Hit the ball, Kev!
Show 'em what you got!

59:18.931 --> 59:20.558
– Come on, Greg.
– Damn!

59:20.725 --> 59:22.476
– He's got nothing.
– Come on, Greg.

59:22.643 --> 59:25.146
– Service.
– Come on, Greg.

59:28.983 --> 59:30.317
– Nice serve, pal.
– All right.

59:30.484 --> 59:31.694
Bring it on, Jack.

59:32.903 --> 59:37.700
– Set it!
– Oh, Greg! Come on!

59:37.867 --> 59:40.870
– Nice shot, Maverick!
– Sweet setup, Iceman.

59:41.036 --> 59:44.331
– Nice one, nurse.
– Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.667
You gotta rush the net on defense.
Don't be afraid of the ball.

59:46.834 --> 59:49.462
– It's Greg.
– Huddle up, team. Huddle up.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.839
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid of the ball.

59:52.006 --> 59:54.842
– Come on. This is unacceptable.
– He's gotta go for the ball.

59:55.009 --> 59:58.512
– Here's what we gotta do.
– Let's go! We're gettin' cold in here.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.055
We're gettin' creamed, people.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:02.516
If Florence Nightingale
would play defense.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:05.561
– Larry, I missed one shot.
– It was a big shot.

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:09.231
Larry, keep floatin' where you are.
Denny, take the deep shots.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.359
Greg, nobody's expecting much out
of you. If I set you up with the ball,

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.653
– can you jump up and spike it?
– No.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.158
– I'd have to be pretty high, but yeah.
– I bet you would, Panama Red.

01:00:19.325 --> 01:00:21.744
– Everybody, look sharp. Break!
– Let's play some ball.

01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:24.497
– All right, here we go.
– Come on!

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:28.167
– Let's go.
– Come on.

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:32.046
– Greg!
– Set!

01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:35.382
You gotta spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:38.177
– Look how Bob did that. Nice play, Bob.
– Thanks, Jack.

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:41.472
– Fire it up there, Focker!
– Let's do it!

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:44.099
– Way to go, Deb!
– Greg!

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.231
Honey! God!

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:58.239
– What the hell's the matter with you?
– It's only a game, Focker!

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.741
Oh, honey! I'm coming!

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:03.619
Get some ice.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:07.498
– My eye! Oh, my eye!
– Focker!

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.959
God!

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:15.589
– Pam, help your sister, please.
– I'm so sorry, Deb.

01:01:15.756 --> 01:01:19.051
Deb, you can totally see Voit
backwards on your forehead.

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:21.595
– Denny, get outta here!
– You the bandleader?

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:24.181
Go over the song selection
with Bob. Bob? Bob!

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.934
– Yeah, Jack.
– Are you a Mr. Focker?

01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:29.770
– Yes.
– OK. Sign here, please.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:32.189
– Great. Thank you.
– I'm sorry, honey.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:44.618
Hey, your suitcase. You go through it,
make sure it's all there?

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:47.121
– Yeah, it's fine. What's up?
– Good.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.876
Wanted to make sure you're OK
since hitting the spike

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.210
heard 'round the world.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.130
– Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
– It's OK.

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:59.091
I don't know what got into me, Iceman.

01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.426
«Iceman»?

01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:02.970
I'm sorry. That a special thing
between you and Kevin?

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.556
– Oh, Greg, stop it.
– Stop what, Iceman?

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:08.350
<i>Top Gun</i> was a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:12.313
– All right? That's it.
– Iceman. I have no problem with that.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.816
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what this is all about?

01:02:15.983 --> 01:02:21.280
– I can't be Maverick. Kevin's Maverick.
– He used to be, but we can change that.

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:25.326
– Can he be Goose?
– No, because Goose dies in the end.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:27.995
It's very sad.

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.541
– Honey, I don't really…
– Greg, shut up.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.168
OK.

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:49.266
– Dad, you ever think of knocking?
– Not in my own den.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:53.187
– What are you two doing in here?
– I'd say rounding second base.

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:59.193
– This is Greg's room, Dad.
– We're gonna use it for storage.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.488
Greg will stay in Debbie's room,
and she'll bunk up with you tonight.

01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:04.531
Fine. Come on, Greg.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:05.908
OK. I'll be right up.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:07.743
I'll meet you upstairs.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.330
– Oh, good. They found your suitcase.
– Yeah.

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:15.542
Hey, Jack, I don't quite know
what happened back at the tux shop.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:19.254
If I've given you the wrong impression
regarding Pam in any way, I'm sorry.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:24.259
OK? I have nothing but the best
intentions with Pam, and I just…

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.388
There's something in the suitcase here
that I'm planning on giving her

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:29.682
that I think symbolizes…

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:35.604
…the level of my commitment to her.

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:41.276
And I wouldn't feel right asking her to
wear it without her father's permission.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.906
– Jack?
– Did you flush this toilet?

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:50.327
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.454
I saw little Jinxy come in last night,

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:55.374
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:59.169
Jinx knows not to use that toilet,
and even if he did, he'd never flush it.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:02.256
– What does it matter?
– The matter, Greg, R.N.,

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:04.758
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.387
and when you have a septic tank nearly
full and a toilet running all night,

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:10.389
then you could have a hell of a problem.

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:12.599
Mr. Byrnes?

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.394
This was not part of my job description.

01:04:15.561 --> 01:04:17.771
Nice stench. You're really
on a roll there, bud.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.773
Bite me, Denny!

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.234
Listen to me. In 20 hours,
I'm having a wedding here,

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:24.236
so I need my cesspool pumped now!

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:27.740
– Not tomorrow. Now!
– Dad, what's going on?

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:31.076
– Oh, my God!
– What's that smell?

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:33.287
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:36.290
Focker flushed the toilet in the den,
so the septic tank is overflowing.

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:39.042
Jack, I told you. It wasn't me.
It was Jinx.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:41.462
Focker, I'm not gonna tell you again!

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.465
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for chrissakes!

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.468
The animal doesn't
even have thumbs, Focker.

01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:51.680
– Hey, look at this!
– Kevo!

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:53.974
Over by the tree, right?

01:04:57.186 --> 01:04:59.313
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.900
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.360
– Kevin, no!
– No, no, no, no!

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:14.536
– No, no, no!
– What the heck?

01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:34.223
I know that's what I said I wanted,
that's what I wanted.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:36.266
It is a black Samsonite suitcase.

01:05:36.475 --> 01:05:38.352
What I'm saying is,
do you think it's possible

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:40.813
that the Samsonite people,
in some crazy little scheme

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.857
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.776
<i>– I don't think so.</i>
– Really, you don't?

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.320
<i>I am going to need your
baggage claim number again.</i>

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:49.488
Jinx, stop.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:41.039
– I know I signed for it.
<i>– I'm looking at your signature.</i>

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.333
Do me a favor.
Could I talk to your supervisor?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.586
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:46.962
– What's your name?
<i>– Joy.</i>

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:50.757
– Let me talk to your supervisor.
<i>– My supervisor is on a break.</i>

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.427
When he gets back, have him
give me a call right away.

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.429
– It's a very important bag.
<i>– I'm sure it is, sir.</i>

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:03.437
Jinx.

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:06.565
Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:09.401
Please, I'm in a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.486
<i>– So the name's «Greg Focker»?</i>
– I don't know.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.280
Greg or Gregory. Run both names.

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:16.658
Jinx.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.285
Come on. No. Jinx.

01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:19.786
Come here. Jinxy.

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:23.123
Mew, mew, mew. No. No.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.626
Jinx. Oh, shit.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.295
Greg didn't ace his med school boards.

01:07:28.462 --> 01:07:30.005
He never even took
the goddamn MCATs.

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:34.134
Oh, Jack, that's what you
had your sources check out?

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:36.803
What this poor boy did
on some test scores?

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.348
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:41.850
A lot of these hospital workers
are pill poppers

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:43.769
looking for easy access to ludes.

01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:46.605
We already know that he's been
puffin' the magic dragon.

01:07:46.772 --> 01:07:49.024
I knew the little quack was lying.

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:54.154
Jinxy. Come here.
Come here, little Jinxy head.

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:03.997
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat
I won't hurt you</i>

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:12.589
– The fact is, Greg lied to you.
– He did not lie to me, Dad.

01:08:12.798 --> 01:08:14.675
He lied to you, and I thought
you should know the truth.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.051
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:19.680
I don't care what
your information says, Dad.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.265
Greg took the MCATs. OK?

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.247
Holy…

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.125
Shit!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.309
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:53.774
No!

01:10:01.782 --> 01:10:03.742
Holy…

01:10:03.909 --> 01:10:06.286
– No!
– Oh, my God!

01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.455
All right, everybody.
All right, stand back.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:10.874
Stay back. Stay back.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:15.128
– Watch out. Watch out!
– Oh, Jack! Oh, God!

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:21.968
We've got a fire! Somebody call 911
right away! Hurry up!

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.726
Jinxy! Jinxy!

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:33.146
We've checked every yard, every car
on the street. Nobody's seen him.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.232
He's not up in any
of the trees, Jack.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.317
We checked all the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.903
Yeah, none of the neighbors
have seen him either.

01:10:40.112 --> 01:10:43.198
You tried to milk him, didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:45.325
Dad, stop it. That's enough.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:48.078
– Honey, please calm down.
– How can I calm down

01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:50.080
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.289
and the ring bearer's missing?

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:54.459
– What do you mean, «the ring bearer»?
– Your daddy didn't tell you?

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:57.671
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this little pillow.

01:10:57.838 --> 01:10:59.714
Oh, no. No, you didn't, Dad.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.508
Yeah, yeah. You put
this around the neck,

01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:03.218
and these ribbons are for the rings.

01:11:03.385 --> 01:11:06.513
– That's adorable, Jack.
– Oh, for chrissakes!

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.806
That's great, Dad.

01:11:07.973 --> 01:11:09.558
Yeah, but now we have
to postpone the rehearsal.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.477
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:14.855
We're gonna canvass the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:18.024
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule for the morning.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.192
– Jack!
– No!

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:21.903
We cannot cancel the rehearsal
for some stupid cat!

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:26.199
Stupid cat? How could you say that?
That cat's been like a brother to you!

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:30.704
We're supposed to let him wander the
streets without food, water or toilet?

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.000
– Dad, Greg'll find him.
– What?

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:38.003
– Yeah, what?
– Oh, that's wonderful.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:43.466
Fine. Fine. OK. Denny?

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:45.760
– Denny? Denny? Denny!
– Dad, I'm right here.

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:48.805
OK. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:51.516
I'm not wearin' that stupid
pillow thing on my head.

01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:53.935
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

01:11:55.437 --> 01:12:00.358
Jinx! Jinx! Here, Jinx.

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:05.572
You just go and wander the streets
without food, water or toilet? Fucker!

01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:10.160
Actually, you may be in luck.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:13.246
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.540
There he is.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.668
Holy shit, that's Jinx.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:21.796
– Jinxy!
– No, let me see that photo again.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:24.216
You gotta picture him
without that stupid Santa cap.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:28.261
– Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!
– No.

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:32.182
You see, in the picture,
your cat has an all-black tail.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:35.268
– Yeah.
– And this one has a white tip.

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.854
No, I'm sorry about that, chief.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:42.275
– Looks just like him.
– Almost.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.654
Except for that tail.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.250
Dearly beloved…

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:06.800
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here on this beautiful day

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:09.135
to join Dr. Robert Banks…

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:17.352
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here on this beautiful day

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:22.148
to join Dr. Robert Banks and
Debra Byrnes in holy matrimony.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.651
This is a special day…

01:13:49.134 --> 01:13:51.177
He found him!

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:54.014
It's him! It's him!

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.017
I gotta see this.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:02.397
– Look, Dad, it's Jinx.
– Oh, my little baby!

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:06.818
– We found you. We found you.
– Greg, thank you so much.

01:14:06.985 --> 01:14:09.904
– Where did you find him?
– Gave us a little scare, huh?

01:14:11.031 --> 01:14:12.824
Jinxy.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:31.551
To Greg.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:34.763
– Honey, where is Greg, anyway?
– He's in the restroom.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:38.767
Yes, I tried there. I've tried
every shelter on the north shore, OK?

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:43.521
He's a brown-and-black Himalayan
with an all-black tail.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:48.526
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, OK.
You go check. I'll call you back.

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:53.907
– Hey, hey! It's the man of the hour.
– Hey!

01:14:54.074 --> 01:14:56.951
Sorry, folks. Had to pay
a little visit to the urinal fairy.

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:05.543
Greg, nice work with the cat today.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.421
Thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad I could help out.

01:15:08.588 --> 01:15:11.424
We never did get to finish
that little «convo» back in the den.

01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:14.719
When you have a minute, there is still
something I'd love to talk to you about.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:17.972
We'll get right to it as soon
as we get back. You have my word.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:20.642
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of trust.

01:15:20.809 --> 01:15:23.812
Guess who's back in the circle of trust.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.798
Look at Jack!

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:56.428
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:59.806
Maybe I should ask him to dance.
What do you think?

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:03.977
Sure. I bet he could whittle a private
little dance floor for the two of you.

01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:06.104
I'm serious.

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:08.857
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:13.486
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.530
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but…

01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:18.199
Come on. Seriously. Seriously.

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:20.493
Part of you wishes
you ended up with him.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:25.665
Yes, he's very talented,
but it would've never worked out.

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:27.667
Why not?

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:30.670
I was never in love with Kevin.

01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:36.342
I'm in love with you.

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:40.513
– That's a good explanation.
– Think so?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.307
Thought you'd like that.

01:16:42.474 --> 01:16:44.684
– I do.
– I'm glad.

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:50.857
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like half an hour ago.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:55.737
OK, I already…
I already described it. Airline.

01:16:55.904 --> 01:16:57.864
Messages.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:01.826
It's, it's brown…

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:06.706
…with a little bit of black trim.

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:08.875
Yes.

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:10.960
<i>Please enter your four-digit code.</i>

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:16.549
<i>Jack, hi. It's Hank Macatee
from next door.</i>

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:20.011
<i>You'll never guess who wandered
over here this afternoon. Mr. Jinx.</i>

01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:23.264
<i>Yeah, he's not wearing his collar,
but I'm sure it's Jinxy.</i>

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:25.600
<i>Thought you might be worried,
so just give me a jingle</i>

01:17:25.767 --> 01:17:28.520
<i>when you guys get home, and
I'll bring the little rascal over.</i>

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:31.064
OK, well, if you could
just keep checking, please,

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:33.274
and I'll call you back later. Thanks.

01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:38.238
– Any luck?
– No, they're still looking.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.281
Hey, Jack, this is a great party.

01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:44.786
I guess sometimes these things come
together in their own kooky sort of way.

01:17:44.953 --> 01:17:47.914
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:51.793
– You found him at that animal shelter?
– Yeah, right.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.463
– The important thing is he's home now.
– Yes.

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:58.258
Yeah. You know, there's something
about that ball of fur

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.468
that just puts a big smile on my face.

01:18:00.635 --> 01:18:04.097
Yeah. You haven't seen any
of his latest tricks, have you?

01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:06.266
No.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.309
Well, when we get back, I'll show you.

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:11.729
We don't have to do it tonight. He's had
a long day. He's probably tired.

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:14.732
– I wouldn't want to…
– I think he'd like to show you tonight.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:20.572
Why don't you give me
the key and let me drive?

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.574
Hey, Larry. You know what?
Why don't I drive?

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.576
– It's a very expensive car.
– Good idea.

01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:26.661
I've always wanted to test-drive a Benz.

01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:28.830
Be my guest, Focker.

01:18:29.956 --> 01:18:33.835
– Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?
– Larry said I could drive.

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:41.092
– Let's go. Hurry, hurry. All right.
– Bye, guys.

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:42.969
– See you.
– Thanks for driving.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:50.685
– Drives better than your Taurus, Greg?
– Yeah.

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:53.313
Come on. Get in the car, honey.
Let's go. Hurry up.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.523
OK, OK.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.484
Whoa, nellie!

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:01.446
Everybody comfortable back there?

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:06.451
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.539
You got your seat belts on back there?
Get your seat belts on.

01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.671
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.551
– You're driving like a maniac!
– Focker, take it easy!

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:27.013
– Benz drives like a dream, Lar.
– Let's not make it a nightmare, huh?

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:32.185
Oh, there's Jack.

01:19:34.312 --> 01:19:37.148
Hey, Jackie.

01:19:42.153 --> 01:19:44.864
You wanna play, pops? Let's play.

01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.244
OK, now, Greg? Greg?

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:53.748
Greg, no!

01:19:59.003 --> 01:20:02.715
– Is everything OK, honey?
– Yeah, just trying to make good time.

01:20:04.175 --> 01:20:06.052
What the heck is the matter with you?

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:08.554
All right. We're gonna be home.
We're gonna get home.

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:10.348
Very soon, we're gonna get home.

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:18.106
It's not the Autobahn.
Come on, Greg!

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:23.778
Jesus!

01:20:23.945 --> 01:20:27.198
– Maybe you should drive after all.
– We're OK.

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:34.914
All right.

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:44.257
Oh, no. No, please.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.511
– Yes!
– Jack just turned.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:53.391
You were supposed to make
that left at the light, Focker.

01:20:54.142 --> 01:20:56.185
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.855
Where does he think he's going?

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:02.817
– Home, home, home.
– What a wild ride.

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:05.445
Who gave him the keys?

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.656
– OK, we're out.
– I'm gonna get out on your side, honey.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:11.826
– I wonder if he has a license.
– Yeah, a license to kill.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:18.458
Come on, everybody.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:21.627
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:24.255
You're a lunatic!

01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:26.299
Come on, Linda!

01:21:26.466 --> 01:21:27.925
Hey, hey!

01:21:35.975 --> 01:21:38.811
– What in the world…
– Oh, my…

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:41.147
Oh, the dress!

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:43.649
It was the cat! Goddamn you!

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.777
– Dad, Dad… Dad! Dad!
– Jinx, I'm gonna…

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.695
Calm down!

01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:51.491
– Where's the cat?
– Cat got out! Cat got out, Jack!

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:04.128
You spray-painted his tail to make him
look like Jinxy, didn't you, Focker?

01:22:05.213 --> 01:22:07.006
Greg, what's he talking about?

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:11.344
Hank Macatee called me a couple of
hours ago and told me he found Jinxy.

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:13.304
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.

01:22:13.471 --> 01:22:17.183
He spray-painted his tail, then
tried to beat us back here so that

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:20.478
– he could get rid of the evidence.
– Oh, no.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.817
Please tell me that's not true, Greg.

01:22:27.485 --> 01:22:31.030
It was just a temporary solution
until I could find the real Jinx.

01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:36.327
How could you do something like that?

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:39.831
– I'm sorry.
– What are you going to tell me next?

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:42.500
That you set Kevin's altar on fire?

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:46.796
Oh, my God.

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:52.552
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx up onto the roof.

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:55.888
I had a smoke, and I think
I might have lit something that…

01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:02.019
I don't know what happened. He put
so much goddamn lacquer on that thing.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:07.441
– It was an accident waiting to happen.
– This is very disappointing, Greg.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:14.115
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.119
So you lied to me
about everything, Greg?

01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:20.913
You lied about the cat,
the fire, about the MCATs.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.250
I didn't lie about the MCATs.
Don't you see what's happening here?

01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.753
– Your dad has turned you against me.
– I didn't turn her against you.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.422
You did that to yourself.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:34.927
Jack, please. You didn't like me
from the second I walked in here.

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:37.930
I'm a very accepting person, Focker.

01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:41.767
– All I ask for is honesty.
– Oh, honesty?

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:45.605
You wanna talk about
truth and honesty, Jack?

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.440
OK, let's talk
a little truth and honesty.

01:23:47.607 --> 01:23:52.570
Let's talk a little
«Operation Ko Samui,» Jack.

01:23:52.737 --> 01:23:54.614
What's he talking about, Dad?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.116
Yeah, that's weird, 'cause
I thought there weren't any secrets

01:23:57.283 --> 01:23:59.368
inside the circle of trust, Jack.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.454
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:04.957
You don't? What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:07.752
Hey, Pam, guess what. Daddy's planning

01:24:07.919 --> 01:24:11.130
a little covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:13.633
You are?

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.760
Round and round we go, Jack. Hey.

01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:17.803
I bet everybody would love
to hear about your rendezvous

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:19.764
in the parking lot of
the Oyster Bay Drug and Sundrie.

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.808
You know what I'm talking about.
Where the guy gave you the passports

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:26.479
and the documents. Or how about
your little phone call in Thai?

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.981
– Jack can't talk Thai.
– Oh, no, Dina.

01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:33.194
Jack can talk Thai.
Jack talk Thai very well.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.322
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

01:24:36.489 --> 01:24:39.742
He's still very much in the CIA.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.996
– Daddy. What…
– He's right.

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:47.833
He's right. My cover's blown.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.338
I am planning a secret operation
the day after the wedding.

01:24:52.505 --> 01:24:54.006
What?

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:56.842
A surprise honeymoon for Deb and Bob.

01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.887
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:01.639
What?

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:04.517
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!

01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:08.229
That guy I was meeting in the parking
lot is Thor Svenson, my travel agent.

01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:10.356
He was giving me their visas.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:16.278
Wow, Thailand. Thanks a lot, J.B.
That's something.

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.572
Don't mention it. I just…

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.617
You know, if this nursing thing
doesn't work out, Focker,

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:24.203
I'd say you definitely have
a career in espionage.

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:29.667
Thanks, Greg.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.578
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go to the airport now.

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:13.210
I guess you're gonna stay here.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:18.883
Pam, I…

01:26:50.915 --> 01:26:53.959
– Gaylord M. Focker?
– Gaylord? Gaylord?

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:56.128
Yeah, that's me.

01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:59.632
– I thought your name was Greg.
– It is.

01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:01.801
– That's not what it says on the form.
– I know.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:04.637
It's my legal name. Nobody's called me
by it since third grade.

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:09.016
Whatever.

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:13.979
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.904
– Denny.
– I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just…

01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.489
It's not a normal name.

01:27:24.657 --> 01:27:27.535
– Come on. Now look what you've done.
– Oh, Pammy.

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.954
Don't… Don't go away.

01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:06.824
You're in luck. There is room.

01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:19.545
And without a Saturday stay-over,
that fare difference will be $1,137.11.

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:26.719
– Did you want me to book you the seat?
– OK. All right.

01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:29.930
Did you want to check any bags today?

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.017
We should be all right with
only one usher, don't you think?

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.646
I'm not so sure, Jack.

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:26.779
Thought you might like to see this.

01:29:35.496 --> 01:29:38.624
– How did you get this?
– Oh, I have my sources, too.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:47.132
I called Gaylord, aka
Greg's parents in Detroit.

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:50.511
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.

01:29:50.678 --> 01:29:54.515
Oh, honey. It… That doesn't matter
if he did well on some test.

01:29:54.682 --> 01:29:56.684
What does that prove?
Look at this place!

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:59.645
He almost destroyed the wedding
because he lied!

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:06.569
I love you, Daddy, but you
can be a real jerk sometimes.

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:14.034
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough for Pam.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:16.495
Who is, Jack?

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:19.999
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:27.965
I mean, do you realize that you
never even warmed up to Kevin

01:30:28.132 --> 01:30:30.092
until she broke up with him?

01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:33.971
Maybe it's time you think about
what Pam wants.

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:50.195
Greg, it's me.

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.365
I'm sure you're in the air by now,

01:30:53.532 --> 01:30:57.077
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.

01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:02.708
Listen, I am so sorry.

01:31:02.875 --> 01:31:07.671
I acted like a complete idiot,
and I hope that you can forgive me.

01:31:09.048 --> 01:31:13.552
I mean, I don't care about
the fire or the cat or…

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:19.558
I mean, I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.

01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:23.854
That's actually really gross,
but the point is that…

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:28.400
…that I understand
why you did it, and…

01:31:28.567 --> 01:31:32.071
…and I love you. I want you
to know that I really…

01:31:32.237 --> 01:31:34.406
I really, really love you, and…

01:31:37.576 --> 01:31:42.748
When you get this,
will you please call me? OK. Bye.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.298
Marty, listen, I need
a commercial flight ID scan.

01:31:51.465 --> 01:31:53.675
Interstate from New York
La Guardia to Chicago.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.053
Four-hour sweeps,
backwards and forwards.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.765
Last name: Foxtrot, Oscar,
Charlie, Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

01:31:59.932 --> 01:32:02.434
First name: Golf,
Alpha, Yankee, Lima…

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:07.314
<i>Gaylord Focker on Atlantic American
flight 27, departs 2:35.</i>

01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:10.275
– 2:35? Twenty-three minutes. Thanks.
<i>– Affirmative.</i>

01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:13.570
– Enjoy your flight.
– Thanks.

01:32:13.737 --> 01:32:15.280
Hello.

01:32:17.783 --> 01:32:20.619
I'm sorry. We're only boarding
rows nine and above right now.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:24.540
– You'll have to wait.
– Well, I'm in row eight.

01:32:24.707 --> 01:32:26.750
Please step aside, sir.

01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:28.919
It's just one row.
Don't you think it's OK if I…

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:30.921
We'll call your row momentarily.

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:35.134
Step aside, sir.

01:32:59.825 --> 01:33:03.036
Thank you for waiting. We'd like to
continue boarding the aircraft now.

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:06.165
We're now boarding all rows, please.
All remaining rows.

01:33:13.672 --> 01:33:15.048
Hello.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:19.720
Enjoy your flight.

01:33:35.694 --> 01:33:37.696
Excuse me.

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.200
OK, where's the fire, huh?

01:33:46.163 --> 01:33:48.582
Will you hand me
a pillow over there?

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:51.376
– You're gonna have to check that.
– I got it.

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:54.171
– No, I'm sorry. That bag won't fit.
– No, I'm not… hey.

01:33:54.338 --> 01:33:57.049
– I'm not checking my bag, OK?
– There's no need to raise your voice.

01:33:57.216 --> 01:34:00.594
I'm not raising my voice. This would be
raising my voice to you, OK?

01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:02.179
I don't want to check my bag.

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:05.557
By the way, your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

01:34:05.724 --> 01:34:07.601
Because I already did that once,
and you lost it,

01:34:07.768 --> 01:34:09.895
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly for me.

01:34:10.062 --> 01:34:12.064
– OK?
– I can assure you that your bag

01:34:12.231 --> 01:34:14.066
will be placed safely below deck
with the other luggage.

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:17.778
Oh, yeah? How do you know my bag will
be safe below with the other luggage?

01:34:17.945 --> 01:34:20.447
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?

01:34:20.614 --> 01:34:23.158
Gonna go with the guys with
the earmuffs and put it in there?

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.370
– No.
– No? OK. Then shut your pie hole

01:34:26.537 --> 01:34:29.456
and listen to me when I say
that I am finished

01:34:29.623 --> 01:34:32.960
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:36.797
Sir, we have a policy on this airline
that if a bag is this large, we…

01:34:36.964 --> 01:34:39.550
Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, OK?

01:34:39.716 --> 01:34:42.844
Not like I have a bomb in here, it's
not like I want to blow up the plane.

01:34:43.053 --> 01:34:46.265
I wanna stow my bag according
to your safety regulations.

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:48.475
– Sir, sir…
– If you would take a second

01:34:48.642 --> 01:34:51.645
and take the little sticks out
of your head and clean out your ears,

01:34:51.812 --> 01:34:53.730
maybe you would see that
I'm a person who has feelings,

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.816
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!

01:34:55.983 --> 01:34:58.861
All I wanna do is hold onto my bag
and not listen to you!

01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:01.154
The only way that I would
ever let go of my bag

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:02.823
would be if you came over here now

01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:05.158
and tried to pry it
from my dead, lifeless fingers.

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:09.288
OK? If you can get it from my kung fu
grip, then you can come and have it.

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:11.832
OK? Otherwise, step off, bitch.

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:16.712
Get off of me! Get off of me!

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.423
– You got him?
– Yeah.

01:35:26.138 --> 01:35:28.348
Hey! You can't leave
your vehicle unattended.

01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:30.309
So tow it.

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:32.811
I've got a plane full of people saying
you threatened that stewardess.

01:35:32.978 --> 01:35:34.271
I was not threatening her.

01:35:34.438 --> 01:35:36.690
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead storage thing.

01:35:36.857 --> 01:35:39.359
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her with a bomb!

01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:41.612
– I said I didn't have a bomb!
– You said «bomb.»

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:44.531
– I said, «It's not like I have a bomb.»
– You said «bomb» on an airplane.

01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:47.993
– What's wrong with saying «bomb»?
– You can't say «bomb» on an airplane.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.164
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb! You gonna arrest me?

01:35:52.331 --> 01:35:55.167
– You assaulted an airline employee…
– What if I was a bombardier?

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:57.210
I got enough to put you away
for a few years!

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:01.965
Norm. Take five.
I got a specialist here.

01:36:03.425 --> 01:36:05.677
Bye, Norm.

01:36:10.349 --> 01:36:13.685
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:17.856
– I'm everywhere, Focker.
– I didn't do anything, Jack.

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:19.066
Yeah, I know.

01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:21.985
Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

01:36:22.152 --> 01:36:25.822
I'm not gonna tell anybody anything
until you answer some questions.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:28.575
Unless you want to spend the next
years of your life in prison,

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:30.369
you better goddamn well
tell me the truth.

01:36:30.535 --> 01:36:33.664
No more lies. You understand?
No more lies.

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.791
– Did you do this?
– Just answer the questions.

01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:38.126
– Have me taken off that airplane?
– Answer the question.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:42.214
– Put your hands over there. That's it.
– You're sick, you know that?

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:49.221
Is your name Gaylord Focker?
Yes or no?

01:36:49.388 --> 01:36:52.391
– Yes.
– Are you a male nurse?

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:54.559
– Yes.
– Are you a pothead?

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.603
– No.
– Have you ever smoked pot?

01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:58.605
Yes.

01:36:58.772 --> 01:37:01.608
Did you spray-paint the tail of a cat
to pass him off as Mr. Jinx?

01:37:01.775 --> 01:37:03.402
Yes.

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.612
Because you desperately
were seeking my approval?

01:37:05.779 --> 01:37:08.615
– Yes.
– Because you love my daughter Pam?

01:37:08.782 --> 01:37:11.618
– Yes.
– Do you wanna marry her?

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.622
Do you want to marry her?

01:37:18.041 --> 01:37:21.628
I did, until I met you.

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:23.922
What does that mean?

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:27.384
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:32.097
But frankly, sir, I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.

01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:34.933
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:37.811
about whether or not I could
even survive in your family.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.776
I think you've got some serious issues.

01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:49.448
If I lighten up, would you consider
marrying my daughter?

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:51.616
Would you lighten up a lot?

01:37:52.743 --> 01:37:54.953
– Yeah.
– Yes or no?

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.830
– Yes.
– Would you let me and Pam

01:37:56.997 --> 01:37:58.957
live our lives and
not interfere all the time?

01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:01.960
I promise not to interfere
in your lives all the time.

01:38:02.127 --> 01:38:04.463
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:08.258
Could you at least try, maybe,
to consider another profession?

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.135
– Jack, yes or no?
– Ever?

01:38:10.302 --> 01:38:12.804
– No!
– OK, yes.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:14.806
Would you let me and Pam
sleep in the same room?

01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:18.810
Don't push it, Focker.
You're in a real mess.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.315
If you married my daughter,
would you support her

01:38:23.482 --> 01:38:25.484
in the way that she
deserves to be supported?

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:26.985
Yes.

01:38:27.152 --> 01:38:29.321
Would you be
honest and faithful to her?

01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:31.239
Yes.

01:38:31.406 --> 01:38:35.827
Will you devote yourself entirely to her
for the rest of your life?

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:38.080
Of course.

01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:40.582
Gaylord Focker…

01:38:43.085 --> 01:38:45.087
…will you be my son-in-law?

01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:10.862
Greg? I thought you were
going back to Chicago.

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:14.241
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.

01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:16.368
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:21.498
No. Don't worry. It's OK.
We worked out a lot of our issues.

01:39:21.665 --> 01:39:24.709
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:28.630
Yeah. First he gave me his little
human lie detector thing, but I passed.

01:39:28.797 --> 01:39:30.632
Good.

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:33.343
Yeah, and…

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:36.680
…then he proposed.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.142
Are you feeling all right?

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:49.484
Listen. This weekend was a nightmare.
I had this whole elaborate plan,

01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:53.572
and then somewhere between
giving your sister a black eye

01:39:53.738 --> 01:39:57.909
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

01:40:00.453 --> 01:40:03.081
I just… I love you.
I love you so much.

01:40:04.583 --> 01:40:06.793
And our world just makes sense
when I'm with you.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.670
I think he's about to do it, Jack.

01:40:08.837 --> 01:40:12.048
Come on, honey.
Give 'em some privacy.

01:40:13.967 --> 01:40:17.095
And I think if we can get through

01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:20.724
what we got through in the last 48
hours, we could get through anything.

01:40:21.975 --> 01:40:23.476
I think so, too.

01:40:23.643 --> 01:40:26.313
– And, Greg, I don't…
– Wait. Hang on a second.

01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:27.939
Mr. Jinx?

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.739
Hi, Jinx…

01:40:37.616 --> 01:40:39.451
That's a ring.

01:40:40.619 --> 01:40:44.706
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:49.586
Pam?

01:40:49.753 --> 01:40:52.297
– Will you marry me?
– Yes.

01:40:53.632 --> 01:40:55.634
Yes.

01:40:58.637 --> 01:41:00.138
Yes.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:04.851
Attaboy, Greg!

01:41:05.018 --> 01:41:07.979
That «circle of trust» thing?
That's mine.

01:41:11.107 --> 01:41:14.611
Well, looks like we got
another wedding to plan.

01:41:14.778 --> 01:41:17.489
Yep. Just gotta do one more thing.
What's that?

01:41:17.656 --> 01:41:19.282
Meet his parents.

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:21.993
– Jack…
– Honey, relax.

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.746
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

01:41:26.039 --> 01:41:27.540
Good night, Jack.

01:41:35.507 --> 01:41:38.843
I mean, they'd have to be, right?
To name their son Gaylord Focker.

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:44.516
Do you, Debra Byrnes,
take Robert Banks

01:41:44.683 --> 01:41:48.061
– to be your lawfully wedded husband?
– Yes. I mean, I do.

01:41:48.228 --> 01:41:50.855
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:42:08.498 --> 01:42:11.543
Let's just see if you really can
flush the toilet, Jinxy.

01:42:36.735 --> 01:42:38.611
I knew it.

01:42:38.778 --> 01:42:41.489
<i>Shit!</i>

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:44.325
– I knew it.
<i>– Damn it!</i>

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:55.295
That's my future son-in-law.
What do you think?

01:42:55.462 --> 01:42:57.464
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

01:42:58.423 --> 01:43:00.550
<i>Oh, look at that. Nice, Jack. Hi.</i>

01:43:00.717 --> 01:43:05.055
<i>What's that, Jack? What?
You're a big, bad CIA man, huh?</i>

01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:08.600
<i>They teach you that in the CIA?
They teach you that?</i>

01:43:08.767 --> 01:43:10.810
<i>Oh, yeah. What's that, Jack?</i>

01:43:10.977 --> 01:43:15.940
<i>What? Yeah, you thought Puff was just
the name of the boy's magical dragon?</i>

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.984
<i>Not too quick on the uptake, huh, Jack?</i>

01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:20.445
<i>Why don't you ask Denny
who's puffin' the magic dragon?</i>

01:43:20.612 --> 01:43:24.824
<i>Not onto that one, huh? Surprising
for a big CIA pulse detector.</i>

01:43:25.492 --> 01:43:28.119
<i>Hey, hey, check my pulse
on this question, Jack.</i>

01:43:28.286 --> 01:43:30.372
<i>Do I think you're a psycho? Yes.</i>

01:43:30.538 --> 01:43:34.417
<i>What? Oh, you like my little gift?</i>

01:43:34.584 --> 01:43:37.128
<i>What? The Jerusalem what?</i>

01:43:37.295 --> 01:43:40.298
<i>What? I can't hear you. Jerusalem
toodle-oo-poosey, poosley-loo?</i>

01:43:40.465 --> 01:43:43.134
<i>What? What? Oh, you don't
know shit about flowers.</i>

01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:45.095
<i>What's that? You want me to what?</i>

01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:47.138
<i>You have another question?
Sure. I got one question for you.</i>

01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:49.808
<i>It's… Can you deal with that?</i>

01:47:38.536 --> 01:47:40.000
