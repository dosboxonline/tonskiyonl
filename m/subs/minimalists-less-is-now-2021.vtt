<i>[newsman] </i>Some experts
call it a retail apocalypse.

00:09.009 --> 00:13.805
<i>2019 marked one of the worst years</i>
<i>in a decade for brick-and-mortar stores.</i>

00:15.306 --> 00:16.266
<i>[man] </i>Less Is Now.

00:19.728 --> 00:23.273
<i>[interviewer] Why do you think</i>
<i>this idea of minimalism or simplifying</i>

00:23.356 --> 00:25.191
<i>is really catching on right now?</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:26.109
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:29.571
<i>I think it's because we have</i>
<i>the opportunity to have so much. [laughs]</i>

00:29.654 --> 00:32.073
<i>A portion of America's</i>
<i>definitely addicted to stuff.</i>

00:32.157 --> 00:35.660
<i>Probably not in the classic</i>
<i>psychology sense of addiction.</i>

00:36.244 --> 00:37.871
<i>We just love stuff!</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:39.664
<i>Monday, today, is supposed to be</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.542
<i>the biggest online shopping day</i>
<i>of all times,</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:46.671
<i>reaching around three-and-a-third</i>
<i>billion dollars in online sales.</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:49.758
<i>Anything that you can think of,</i>
<i>you can get on your doorstep,</i>

00:49.841 --> 00:51.009
<i>now within 24 hours.</i>

00:51.092 --> 00:53.136
<i>That's… That's almost like magic, right?</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:58.058
<i>When you look up at the sky, you may soon</i>
<i>see Amazon's army of new-age deliveries.</i>

00:58.141 --> 01:01.227
<i>[newswoman] </i>The electronic aircraft
would have a 15-mile range

01:01.311 --> 01:04.731
<i>and deliver packages within 30 minutes.</i>

01:04.814 --> 01:06.858
<i>[man] The consumer world understands</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:09.736
<i>that if I can get you</i>
<i>to choose before you think,</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:12.530
<i>I'm gonna get you</i>
<i>to buy things you do not need.</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:15.533
<i>My senses are just being bombarded</i>
<i>with reminders,</i>

01:15.617 --> 01:17.243
<i>like, "Hey, you should buy this.</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:19.621
<i>You'd be happier if you buy this."</i>
<i>You know?</i>

01:19.704 --> 01:22.415
<i>[laughing] And it's just sort of like,</i>
<i>in so many ways,</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.501
<i>they're trying</i>
<i>to beat you into submission.</i>

01:24.584 --> 01:26.586
<i>"Okay, I'll buy it! I need it! I need it!"</i>

01:26.669 --> 01:28.296
<i>Amazon, hiring once again.</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:31.299
<i>The company looking to recruit</i>
<i>100,000 workers</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:34.344
<i>to meet surging levels</i>
<i>of e-commerce demand.</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:37.514
<i>Lots of smaller retail businesses</i>
<i>are being lost,</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:40.809
<i>and the power is being consolidated</i>
<i>in the hands of these giants.</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:44.354
<i>Stuff is contributing to our discontent</i>
<i>in so many different ways,</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:46.397
<i>because it's taking the place</i>

01:46.481 --> 01:49.400
<i>of the things that actually</i>
<i>do give us more happiness.</i>

01:51.319 --> 01:56.366
<i>I found minimalism about seven years ago</i>
<i>in the midst of a breakdown.</i>

01:56.449 --> 02:00.703
<i>I was overworked. Um, I was exhausted.</i>
<i>I was heavily stressed out.</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:03.248
<i>There has to be more to life</i>
<i>than just working.</i>

02:03.915 --> 02:07.335
<i>I think immediately I got up,</i>
<i>and I went to my closet,</i>

02:07.418 --> 02:09.212
<i>and I started pulling my clothes out.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:13.758
<i>Uh, I stayed up until 3:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>and I just packed so many things.</i>

02:13.842 --> 02:17.971
<i>[woman] As I started</i>
<i>slowly releasing things,</i>

02:18.054 --> 02:19.556
<i>I gained a sense of freedom.</i>

02:20.098 --> 02:23.476
<i>[woman 2] Change is definitely coming.</i>
<i>Change is inevitable,</i>

02:23.560 --> 02:25.687
<i>because you can't continue to consume</i>

02:25.770 --> 02:28.064
<i>more than the planet can replenish</i>
<i>every year.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:29.482
<i>You just physically can't.</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:32.944
<i>So the question is not</i>
if<i> we are gonna change as a society,</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:34.654
<i>but </i>how <i>we are gonna change.</i>

02:34.737 --> 02:37.365
<i>'Cause we're either gonna change</i>
<i>by design or by disaster.</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:42.036
<i>It all started with one question.</i>

02:42.912 --> 02:46.374
<i>How might your life be better with less?</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:54.299
<i>[birds chirping]</i>

02:56.342 --> 02:57.802
<i>-[man] Want some tea?</i>
<i>-[woman] Sure.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:58.720
<i>[man] Okay.</i>

02:58.803 --> 03:00.597
<i>[woman] It's in the… Yeah. Okay.</i>

03:03.016 --> 03:06.853
<i>[man] Yeah, y-you know, I mean,</i>
<i>aesthetics are important to me,</i>

03:07.395 --> 03:12.192
<i>but what I care most about</i>
<i>is having a place free of clutter.</i>

03:12.275 --> 03:13.651
<i>So when you look around my place,</i>

03:13.735 --> 03:17.071
<i>not everything</i>
<i>is necessarily minimalist design.</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:21.993
<i>I don't go out of my way to specifically</i>
<i>have only minimalist aesthetics.</i>

03:22.076 --> 03:25.747
<i>But to me, it's… it's clutter-free.</i>

03:25.830 --> 03:29.083
<i>We often confuse simplicity with easy,</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:31.502
<i>but it's actually the exact opposite.</i>

03:31.586 --> 03:33.880
<i>Living a simple life,</i>
<i>it takes a lot of work.</i>

03:33.963 --> 03:37.926
<i>It takes a lot of work to be intentional.</i>
<i>What's easy is going with the flow.</i>

03:38.009 --> 03:41.679
<i>It's going out, and going to IKEA,</i>
<i>and buying the cheap furniture</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:45.975
<i>every time you think you need</i>
<i>a piece of furniture or an end table.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:51.981
<i>It is very difficult to go through</i>
<i>some of these stoical experiments</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:55.151
<i>to see what you can live with</i>
<i>or live without,</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:57.278
<i>but, in the end, it's worth the work.</i>

03:57.987 --> 04:00.198
<i>[host]</i>
People go, "Check out this documentary.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.533
<i>-These guys, The Minimalists."</i>
-[hosts 2] <i>The Minimalists.</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:05.703
<i>[host 3] </i>The Minimalists are with us.
Joshua and Ryan.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.748
<i>[TV journalist] They have books,</i>
<i>a podcast, and a Netflix documentary,</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:12.210
<i>all guiding typical consumers</i>
<i>on how to downsize their way to happiness.</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:17.757
<i>[Ryan] I don't think you can understand</i>
<i>how Josh and I came to be minimalists</i>

04:17.840 --> 04:19.676
<i>without looking at our upbringings.</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:22.929
<i>Both of us grew up poor.</i>

04:23.012 --> 04:28.017
<i>Our moms had issues with substance abuse,</i>
<i>and we really never had enough.</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:31.312
<i>Dude, look at this. This is hilarious.</i>

04:31.396 --> 04:32.939
<i>[laughter]</i>

04:33.022 --> 04:36.025
<i>Even our furniture.</i>
<i>[chuckling] It was like…</i>

04:36.109 --> 04:38.194
<i>It was like do-it-yourself furniture.</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:40.280
<i>That's like our cupboard in the kitchen.</i>

04:40.363 --> 04:45.368
<i>I was really a happy kid</i>
<i>up until, uh, about the second grade</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:48.621
<i>when my parents got divorced.</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:50.999
<i>It happens to a lot of kids,</i>
<i>their parents get divorced.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:55.920
<i>But I remember things</i>
<i>really getting dysfunctional when…</i>

04:56.004 --> 04:59.048
<i>uh, when my mom left my dad.</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:02.385
<i>And there was just a lot of…</i>

05:02.468 --> 05:05.179
<i>a lot of partying, I remember.</i>

05:05.263 --> 05:10.268
<i>And, um, you know, as a kid,</i>
<i>it looked like a lot of fun.</i>

05:10.351 --> 05:12.520
<i>My mom did a good job</i>
<i>of making it look fun.</i>

05:13.187 --> 05:16.983
<i>I met Josh in the fifth grade</i>
<i>when I moved to his middle school.</i>

05:17.066 --> 05:18.151
<i>[laughs] Oh!</i>

05:18.234 --> 05:20.820
<i>[Ryan] It could have been</i>
<i>that we were both from broken homes</i>

05:20.903 --> 05:22.405
<i>and didn't have much money growing up,</i>

05:22.488 --> 05:25.783
<i>or maybe it was that we were</i>
<i>the two fattest kids in our grade,</i>

05:25.867 --> 05:28.870
<i>but we just hit it off,</i>
<i>and we became best friends.</i>

05:29.495 --> 05:32.957
<i>[Joshua] When we were growing up,</i>
<i>I feel like we could've used minimalism,</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:36.336
<i>because minimalism is basically</i>
<i>the intentional use of resources you have,</i>

05:36.419 --> 05:39.672
<i>and if you have very few resources,</i>
<i>like we did growing up,</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:41.507
<i>man, we could've done much better</i>

05:41.591 --> 05:43.343
<i>by being more deliberate</i>
<i>with those resources.</i>

05:43.426 --> 05:45.303
<i>It's interesting,</i>
<i>because when you're poor,</i>

05:45.386 --> 05:48.473
<i>it's like, when someone</i>
<i>offers you something, you take it.</i>

05:48.973 --> 05:53.770
<i>I-I think about my household growing up,</i>
<i>and we had so much stuff,</i>

05:53.853 --> 05:57.440
<i>because we took every single thing</i>
<i>that was offered to us.</i>

05:57.523 --> 06:00.026
<i>However, we had a lot of stuff</i>
<i>that we didn't need.</i>

06:00.109 --> 06:04.572
<i>In fact, it was just clutter,</i>
<i>and it did not add any value.</i>

06:05.406 --> 06:09.035
<i>As we get more space,</i>
<i>we fill it with more things.</i>

06:09.118 --> 06:11.245
<i>As we get more things, we need more space,</i>

06:11.329 --> 06:13.831
<i>so we turn to storage lockers,</i>
<i>or we turn to bigger houses.</i>

06:14.707 --> 06:20.088
<i>And we never really stop to question,</i>
<i>"What is essential? What is necessary?"</i>

06:20.171 --> 06:24.008
<i>Then, "How much of the stuff is actually</i>
<i>adding any value to my life at all?"</i>

06:24.509 --> 06:25.843
<i>A decade ago,</i>

06:25.927 --> 06:29.889
<i>by the time I was 28 years old,</i>
<i>I had achieved everything I ever wanted.</i>

06:29.972 --> 06:33.559
<i>I was the youngest director</i>
<i>in my company's 140-year history,</i>

06:33.643 --> 06:36.771
<i>and I had all the fringe benefits</i>
<i>of a middle manager</i>

06:36.854 --> 06:38.606
<i>at a major corporation.</i>

06:38.689 --> 06:40.358
<i>The luxury cars,</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:42.819
<i>the closet filled with designer clothes,</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:45.988
<i>the big suburban house</i>
<i>with more toilets than people.</i>

06:46.864 --> 06:50.159
<i>I guess you could say</i>
<i>I was living the American dream.</i>

06:52.370 --> 06:54.789
<i>But then, my mom died…</i>

06:55.915 --> 06:57.500
<i>and my marriage ended…</i>

06:58.376 --> 06:59.752
<i>both in the same month.</i>

07:00.294 --> 07:03.089
<i>And these two events</i>
<i>forced me to look around</i>

07:03.172 --> 07:06.259
<i>and start to question</i>
<i>what had become my life's focus.</i>

07:06.342 --> 07:07.593
<i>You know what I realized?</i>

07:07.677 --> 07:12.390
<i>I realized I was so focused</i>
<i>on so-called success, and achievement,</i>

07:12.473 --> 07:16.269
<i>and especially</i>
<i>on the accumulation of stuff.</i>

07:17.061 --> 07:19.522
<i>I might have been living</i>
<i>the American dream,</i>

07:20.022 --> 07:21.566
<i>but it wasn't </i>my <i>dream.</i>

07:21.649 --> 07:23.651
<i>It took getting everything</i>
<i>I thought I wanted</i>

07:23.734 --> 07:26.320
<i>to realize</i>
<i>that maybe everything I ever wanted</i>

07:26.404 --> 07:29.657
<i>wasn't actually what I wanted at all.</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:34.203
<i>[woman] Corporations</i>
<i>and the drive for corporate profit</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:37.623
<i>is absolutely behind the addiction</i>
<i>to stuff that we have in this country.</i>

07:38.124 --> 07:40.293
<i>The way corporations are structured</i>
<i>in this country</i>

07:40.376 --> 07:42.044
<i>is they really need to keep growing.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.922
<i>A corporation's primary obligation</i>
<i>is to their shareholders,</i>

07:45.006 --> 07:47.884
<i>to which they have to keep delivering</i>
<i>increased revenue,</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:50.553
<i>and that's sort of the foundation</i>
<i>of capitalism, growth.</i>

07:50.636 --> 07:55.183
<i>I-I don't think the problem has much to do</i>
<i>with how much we're growing,</i>

07:56.267 --> 07:59.020
<i>but rather how we answer the question</i>
<i>of "where are we going?"</i>

07:59.103 --> 08:01.522
<i>I think one of the biggest problems</i>
<i>we have in our world now</i>

08:01.606 --> 08:04.066
<i>is that people</i>
<i>really aren't free to choose.</i>

08:04.150 --> 08:06.027
<i>We talk about being in a free market</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:08.404
<i>or a free society,</i>
<i>but people aren't really free to choose.</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:11.199
<i>Because you just have</i>
<i>one or two large institutions</i>

08:11.282 --> 08:13.659
<i>that have these artificial monopolies,</i>

08:13.743 --> 08:16.120
<i>and they get to decide for everyone</i>

08:16.204 --> 08:18.206
<i>what you can watch,</i>
<i>what you can listen to.</i>

08:18.289 --> 08:21.751
<i>And so, manipulation of… of our interests,</i>

08:21.834 --> 08:26.756
<i>manipulation of our natural,</i>
<i>God-given taste really is happening.</i>

08:26.839 --> 08:32.178
<i>[man] Marketers are really impressive</i>
<i>in their ability to manipulate the mind,</i>

08:32.261 --> 08:35.097
<i>in their ability to create a need</i>
<i>or a perceived need</i>

08:35.181 --> 08:37.391
<i>out of something that was a want.</i>

08:37.475 --> 08:41.687
<i>We live in the most advertised-to culture</i>
<i>in the history of the world.</i>

08:41.771 --> 08:42.605
<i>Think about it.</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:47.318
<i>Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent</i>
<i>telling us we need this,</i>

08:47.401 --> 08:48.486
<i>and it has an effect.</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:51.989
<i>[Joshua] The money spent on advertising</i>
<i>in the United States</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:55.785
<i>has increased</i>
<i>from just over $5 billion in the 1950s</i>

08:55.868 --> 08:59.080
<i>to $240 billion a year today.</i>

08:59.163 --> 09:01.290
<i>And since the turn of the 21st century,</i>

09:01.374 --> 09:05.253
<i>much of that spending has moved</i>
<i>from television and radio</i>

09:05.336 --> 09:06.921
<i>to digital advertising.</i>

09:07.004 --> 09:10.424
<i>The result, intelligent and predictive ads</i>

09:10.508 --> 09:13.261
<i>that seem to know us</i>
<i>better than we know ourselves.</i>

09:13.344 --> 09:16.556
<i>Companies have figured out</i>
<i>how to stitch our devices together,</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:20.810
<i>so they know when you pick up your tablet</i>
<i>or switch to your smartphone,</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:23.271
<i>when you change the channel on your TV</i>

09:23.354 --> 09:25.439
<i>or speak to your smart device.</i>

09:25.523 --> 09:29.068
<i>Using the GPS on your devices,</i>
<i>they can track your movement</i>

09:29.151 --> 09:30.903
<i>to see which billboards you pass,</i>

09:30.987 --> 09:32.780
<i>which stores you frequent,</i>

09:32.863 --> 09:35.908
<i>and even the amount of credit card debt</i>
<i>you've racked up.</i>

09:35.992 --> 09:37.201
<i>They map these movements</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:39.996
<i>to know when it's the perfect time</i>
<i>to message you next.</i>

09:40.079 --> 09:44.834
<i>And the end goal is always the same.</i>
<i>To get you to buy more stuff.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:49.672
<i>And one of the tricks they use</i>
<i>is what we call deficit advertising.</i>

09:49.755 --> 09:52.133
<i>They send us advertisements</i>

09:52.216 --> 09:56.178
<i>that make us subconsciously feel</i>
<i>like we are inadequate, um,</i>

09:56.262 --> 09:57.763
<i>if we don't have this product.</i>

09:57.847 --> 10:00.725
<i>So, "I will not be loved</i>
<i>if I don't have this toothpaste."</i>

10:00.808 --> 10:03.894
<i>"My children will not value me</i>
<i>if I don't have this dish soap."</i>

10:03.978 --> 10:05.271
<i>Everyone's gonna want this.</i>

10:05.354 --> 10:07.648
<i>It's no different</i>
<i>than the premise of working out at a gym.</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:09.233
<i>It's the massaging hand sauna.</i>

10:09.317 --> 10:12.945
<i>-[woman] This is gonna make you thirsty.</i>
<i>-A perfect set for every occasion.</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:15.948
<i>-You can feel it, you can see it.</i>
<i>-[muffled] You can totally feel it.</i>

10:16.032 --> 10:19.952
<i>[Annie] This bombardment of messages</i>
<i>that we are not enough.</i>

10:20.036 --> 10:23.581
<i>So think about what that does</i>
<i>to people, just every day,</i>

10:23.664 --> 10:26.250
<i>over and over, getting messages,</i>
<i>"You are not enough.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:29.712
<i>Your hair, your clothes, your skin,</i>
<i>your body is not enough."</i>

10:29.795 --> 10:31.631
<i>Just relentless.</i>

10:31.714 --> 10:33.424
<i>So then we want to go be enough.</i>

10:33.507 --> 10:36.427
<i>And because we've lost</i>
<i>these other ways of being enough…</i>

10:36.510 --> 10:40.431
<i>The other ways of being enough</i>
<i>are having a community, having a purpose,</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:44.143
<i>you know, having an identity</i>
<i>besides the brand on you.</i>

10:44.226 --> 10:45.645
<i>Because we've lost those,</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:49.065
<i>we misplace our desire</i>
<i>for belonging and satisfaction</i>

10:49.148 --> 10:50.775
<i>by buying more stuff.</i>

10:50.858 --> 10:54.654
<i>We don't really say,</i>
<i>"Okay, I'm gonna turn stuff into my idol."</i>

10:54.737 --> 10:56.781
<i>We don't say that in our intellect.</i>

10:56.864 --> 10:58.783
<i>No one intentionally does that.</i>

10:58.866 --> 11:01.869
<i>But we can tell by our behaviors</i>
<i>that that's actually what we've done.</i>

11:01.952 --> 11:04.163
<i>Because you know,</i>
<i>if you're saying to yourself,</i>

11:04.246 --> 11:06.290
<i>"Well, if I just had that car,</i>
<i>I'd be happy then.</i>

11:06.374 --> 11:08.751
<i>If I just lived in that house,</i>
<i>I'd be happy then.</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:10.628
<i>If we moved to that neighborhood,</i>
<i>we'd be happy.</i>

11:10.711 --> 11:13.506
<i>If I had that couch or those new drapes,</i>
<i>I'd be happy then."</i>

11:13.589 --> 11:17.009
<i>And that means that you're worshiping</i>
<i>at the altar of stuff.</i>

11:17.093 --> 11:20.513
<i>You have officially contracted</i>
<i>the disease of "stuffitis."</i>

11:21.055 --> 11:24.600
<i>And so, it becomes a spiritual thing then,</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:27.895
<i>because it's in competition</i>
<i>with the things that really matter.</i>

11:27.978 --> 11:29.647
<i>[T.K.] Everybody's selling something.</i>

11:29.730 --> 11:33.275
<i>And that doesn't mean that…</i>
<i>that selling is always bad. It's okay.</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:36.987
<i>I want my grocery store</i>
<i>to sell things that I can go buy.</i>

11:37.071 --> 11:40.825
<i>I want to be able to buy food, right?</i>
<i>So I want them to sell that to me.</i>

11:40.908 --> 11:45.621
<i>It's not about looking at people</i>
<i>and condemning them for having an angle,</i>

11:45.705 --> 11:47.832
<i>or for having something they're marketing,</i>

11:47.915 --> 11:50.209
<i>or for having a product</i>
<i>that they're pushing.</i>

11:50.292 --> 11:52.712
<i>It's… It's making sure you understand</i>

11:52.795 --> 11:55.881
<i>that what other people are pushing</i>
<i>is not always consistent.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:59.093
<i>It's not always compatible</i>
<i>with what it is you need.</i>

12:00.428 --> 12:05.307
<i>My shopping habits before minimalism</i>
<i>were compulsive.</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:07.560
<i>I was spending money,</i>
<i>and it was out of control.</i>

12:07.643 --> 12:11.731
<i>Shopping was a crutch.</i>
<i>It was a place I would go to.</i>

12:11.814 --> 12:14.942
<i>Some people like to emotionally eat.</i>
<i>I would emotionally shop.</i>

12:15.025 --> 12:16.485
<i>I was all about the deal.</i>

12:16.569 --> 12:21.782
<i>So I was all about, um, finding,</i>
<i>you know, that 99% off item</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:24.535
<i>that I could get, you know,</i>
<i>for a huge discount.</i>

12:24.618 --> 12:27.329
<i>I would most likely buy that item</i>

12:27.413 --> 12:29.665
<i>thinking this was the only chance</i>
<i>I would get.</i>

12:29.749 --> 12:32.126
<i>I would have, uh, nail clippers.</i>

12:32.209 --> 12:35.463
<i>I would buy fancy ones,</i>
<i>normal ones, regular ones, you know.</i>

12:35.546 --> 12:38.048
<i>Ones that had a different little thing</i>
<i>to go on it.</i>

12:38.132 --> 12:40.134
<i>I would buy just random stuff like that,</i>

12:40.217 --> 12:42.887
<i>and then I would realize,</i>
<i>like, I'm wasting my money</i>

12:42.970 --> 12:44.597
<i>on things that I already have.</i>

12:44.680 --> 12:48.517
<i>I bought a scooter. A 150 cc scooter.</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:50.895
<i>I thought somehow</i>
<i>that would change my life.</i>

12:50.978 --> 12:54.607
<i>I could imagine myself</i>
<i>riding this in Atlanta.</i>

12:54.690 --> 12:58.444
<i>And if you've ever been</i>
<i>in Atlanta traffic,</i>

12:59.111 --> 13:02.573
<i>the last thing you want to be doing</i>
<i>is riding on a scooter.</i>

13:02.656 --> 13:05.409
<i>I felt like I deserved it.</i>
<i>I felt like I worked really hard,</i>

13:05.493 --> 13:09.288
<i>and these beautiful items would show up</i>
<i>and make me so happy.</i>

13:09.371 --> 13:14.293
<i>And then the feeling of shame</i>
<i>would creep up and guilt,</i>

13:14.376 --> 13:17.296
<i>and the bills would show up, um, and I…</i>

13:17.379 --> 13:19.173
<i>It was just a… a bad cycle.</i>

13:24.345 --> 13:26.180
<i>[Joshua] You know,</i>
<i>it's strange in retrospect,</i>

13:26.263 --> 13:28.974
<i>but I didn't realize we were poor</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

13:29.058 --> 13:31.101
<i>We were on food stamps</i>
<i>and government assistance,</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:33.312
<i>but that seemed totally normal to me.</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:35.523
<i>Poverty was sort of like oxygen.</i>

13:35.606 --> 13:38.567
<i>It was all around me,</i>
<i>but I couldn't see it.</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:40.778
<i>It was just there.</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:45.866
<i>Shortly after I was born, my father's</i>
<i>mental health took a turn for the worse,</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:48.536
<i>and that's when everything</i>
<i>started to change.</i>

13:49.036 --> 13:50.871
<i>You see, when Mom married my dad,</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:54.667
<i>she didn't realize he suffered</i>
<i>from manic depression and schizophrenia,</i>

13:54.750 --> 13:57.211
<i>but she found out pretty quickly.</i>

13:58.295 --> 14:01.966
<i>And Dad's mental illness</i>
<i>was only amplified by his alcoholism,</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:06.595
<i>which made him mean, and aggressive,</i>
<i>and completely unpredictable.</i>

14:07.763 --> 14:11.225
<i>I guess the physical abuse started</i>
<i>around the time I was three years old.</i>

14:11.308 --> 14:13.978
<i>In fact, my very first memory as a child</i>

14:14.061 --> 14:18.566
<i>is of my father extinguishing a cigarette</i>
<i>on my mom's bare chest.</i>

14:19.733 --> 14:24.530
<i>Things only got worse from there,</i>
<i>until, eventually, we escaped.</i>

14:25.573 --> 14:28.993
<i>Mom and I moved 20 miles south</i>
<i>to a suburb of Dayton,</i>

14:29.076 --> 14:30.578
<i>which sounds nice, right?</i>

14:30.661 --> 14:31.829
<i>The suburbs!</i>

14:32.830 --> 14:34.874
<i>But it wasn't really nice at all.</i>

14:40.212 --> 14:42.298
<i>It's gonna be right up here on the right.</i>

14:44.550 --> 14:47.011
<i>You see that green house right there?</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

14:49.805 --> 14:52.933
<i>-[turn signal clicking]</i>
<i>-Oh, man.</i>

14:54.143 --> 14:55.060
<i>Look at that.</i>

14:55.728 --> 14:59.982
<i>It's all boarded up,</i>
<i>and it has, like, this wrap on her.</i>

15:02.151 --> 15:04.194
<i>-[car door opens]</i>
<i>-[Joshua] Wanna take a look?</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:07.740
<i>We lived in a house</i>
<i>that was literally falling apart.</i>

15:07.823 --> 15:09.617
<i>The rent was $200 a month.</i>

15:10.200 --> 15:12.745
<i>Our home always smelled faintly</i>
<i>of empty beer cans</i>

15:12.828 --> 15:14.455
<i>and stale cigarette smoke.</i>

15:14.538 --> 15:15.789
<i>I can still smell it now.</i>

15:16.373 --> 15:19.543
<i>Cockroaches scattered</i>
<i>every time I turned on the kitchen light.</i>

15:19.627 --> 15:21.128
<i>And whenever the power got shut off,</i>

15:21.211 --> 15:24.757
<i>we'd run an extension cord from next door</i>
<i>to keep the TV glowing.</i>

15:25.674 --> 15:27.051
<i>Here's the front door here.</i>

15:30.137 --> 15:31.221
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

15:32.765 --> 15:36.143
<i>It looks like they might have squatters.</i>
<i>It's totally falling apart.</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:43.233
<i>So when we first moved down here,</i>
<i>I know we signed up for food stamps.</i>

15:43.317 --> 15:47.154
<i>As a kid, I didn't know the difference</i>
<i>between the white and green money we had,</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:49.365
<i>because the food stamps</i>
<i>were these white bills,</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:52.534
<i>and then, you know,</i>
<i>green money was just… just money, right?</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:55.537
<i>And she would trade the…</i>

15:56.872 --> 15:59.333
<i>She would trade the white bills…</i>

16:00.376 --> 16:03.837
<i>for the green bills, 'cause you needed</i>
<i>the green bills to buy alcohol.</i>

16:04.505 --> 16:07.466
<i>And so, she'd buy</i>
<i>whatever beer was cheapest.</i>

16:07.549 --> 16:11.595
<i>You know, Milwaukee's Best</i>
<i>or the bottom-shelf bottles of wine.</i>

16:12.721 --> 16:16.392
<i>I'd come home each day from school…</i>
<i>I was about six.</i>

16:17.059 --> 16:23.440
<i>I would find Mom just passed out</i>
<i>on the couch day after day after day.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.776
<i>It became this normal occurrence and…</i>

16:27.945 --> 16:31.240
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I didn't realize it at the time,</i>

16:31.323 --> 16:35.411
<i>but I kind of thought it was…</i>
<i>kind of thought it was my fault, you know.</i>

16:37.037 --> 16:40.249
<i>As things started unraveling,</i>
<i>Mom's drinking got worse.</i>

16:40.749 --> 16:44.920
<i>Now don't get me wrong, my mom</i>
<i>was a good person with a good heart</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:46.797
<i>and a hilarious sense of humor.</i>

16:46.880 --> 16:50.676
<i>Somewhere along the way, she'd simply lost</i>
<i>a sense of meaning in her life.</i>

16:50.759 --> 16:53.262
<i>And I knew</i>
<i>the only way for me to break the cycle,</i>

16:53.345 --> 16:56.140
<i>the only way for me to find</i>
<i>the meaning that she'd lost,</i>

16:56.223 --> 16:58.392
<i>was to make a lot of money when I grew up.</i>

17:01.895 --> 17:03.814
<i>I remember back when I was a teenager,</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:07.067
<i>I spent most of my summers</i>
<i>working for my dad,</i>

17:07.151 --> 17:09.319
<i>painting and hanging wallpaper.</i>

17:09.403 --> 17:12.865
<i>And you should have seen</i>
<i>some of the houses we worked in.</i>

17:12.948 --> 17:16.201
<i>Some of them were unbelievably fancy.</i>

17:16.827 --> 17:19.038
<i>Ten thousand square foot garages,</i>

17:19.121 --> 17:21.040
<i>indoor swimming pools,</i>

17:21.123 --> 17:22.750
<i>private bowling alleys.</i>

17:23.250 --> 17:27.713
<i>Nothing I aspired to own myself,</i>
<i>but it was pretty impressive.</i>

17:27.796 --> 17:33.469
<i>And then, one day, we started to work</i>
<i>on this really, really nice house.</i>

17:33.552 --> 17:36.305
<i>It wasn't like</i>
<i>a multi-million-dollar nice house,</i>

17:36.388 --> 17:39.600
<i>but it was something nicer</i>
<i>than my mom or dad had ever owned.</i>

17:39.683 --> 17:41.351
<i>The walls in their home,</i>

17:41.435 --> 17:44.730
<i>they were decorated with the smiling faces</i>
<i>of friends and family</i>

17:44.813 --> 17:47.149
<i>that affirmed the happiness</i>
<i>in their lives.</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:51.695
<i>And the stuff in their home,</i>
<i>it filled every nook and cranny.</i>

17:52.279 --> 17:54.406
<i>I pictured myself living there.</i>

17:54.490 --> 17:59.495
<i>I pictured how happy I would be</i>
<i>if I could just own a house like that,</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:01.705
<i>filled with all that stuff.</i>

18:02.998 --> 18:05.584
<i>So, I turned to my dad and I asked him,</i>

18:05.667 --> 18:09.713
<i>"How much do I need to make</i>
<i>in order to own a house like this?"</i>

18:10.714 --> 18:15.427
<i>He looked at me and he said,</i>
<i>"Son, if you can make $50,0000 a year,</i>

18:15.928 --> 18:18.806
<i>you could probably afford</i>
<i>a place like this."</i>

18:19.306 --> 18:22.768
<i>So that became my benchmark. $50,000.</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:26.396
<i>Then, during my senior year</i>
<i>of high school,</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:30.943
<i>Josh and I, we were sitting</i>
<i>at the lonely lunchroom table together,</i>

18:31.026 --> 18:31.902
<i>and we started to talk</i>

18:31.985 --> 18:35.614
<i>about what we were going to do</i>
<i>with our lives after we graduated.</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:38.242
<i>So I told him,</i>
<i>"I don't know what I'm going to do,</i>

18:38.325 --> 18:43.163
<i>but if I can find a way</i>
<i>to make $50,000 a year,</i>

18:43.664 --> 18:45.249
<i>I know that I'll be happy."</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:49.545
<i>So that's what I went and did.</i>
<i>That's what Josh went and did.</i>

18:49.628 --> 18:53.423
<i>We got sales jobs</i>
<i>and we started earning 50 grand.</i>

18:54.383 --> 18:55.759
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

18:55.843 --> 18:58.804
<i>I wasn't happy.</i>
<i>I had to go back to the drawing board.</i>

18:58.887 --> 19:01.974
<i>And thank goodness,</i>
<i>I found out what had happened.</i>

19:02.683 --> 19:05.394
<i>I forgot to adjust for inflation.</i>

19:06.645 --> 19:07.813
<i>So I thought to myself,</i>

19:07.896 --> 19:11.483
<i>"Well, maybe $65,000 a year,</i>
<i>maybe that was happiness.</i>

19:11.567 --> 19:13.277
<i>Or maybe 90,000,</i>

19:13.360 --> 19:15.696
<i>or maybe six figures,</i>

19:15.779 --> 19:19.366
<i>or maybe owning a bunch of stuff.</i>

19:19.449 --> 19:21.702
<i>Maybe that was happiness."</i>

19:21.785 --> 19:23.453
<i>Whatever happiness was,</i>

19:23.954 --> 19:28.542
<i>I knew, once I got there,</i>
<i>I'd finally feel free.</i>

19:29.501 --> 19:33.839
<i>I bought new cars, and electronics,</i>
<i>and closets full of expensive clothes.</i>

19:33.922 --> 19:36.717
<i>I bought expensive home decorations</i>
<i>and furniture,</i>

19:36.800 --> 19:39.428
<i>and I always had the latest gadgets.</i>

19:39.511 --> 19:43.390
<i>And when there wasn't enough cash</i>
<i>in the bank, I paid for expensive meals,</i>

19:43.473 --> 19:47.477
<i>rounds of drinks, and frivolous vacations</i>
<i>with credit cards.</i>

19:48.103 --> 19:53.525
<i>As I made more money, I spent more money,</i>
<i>all in the pursuit of happiness.</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:56.486
<i>All in the pursuit of the American dream.</i>

19:58.113 --> 19:59.656
<i>[man] One thing I think is unique is</i>

19:59.740 --> 20:03.118
<i>when you're an immigrant,</i>
<i>the American dream is still a good thing.</i>

20:03.202 --> 20:05.913
<i>I think it's only people</i>
<i>who grew up in the American dream</i>

20:05.996 --> 20:07.539
<i>that no longer value the American dream,</i>

20:07.623 --> 20:09.249
<i>because it's become</i>
<i>the American nightmare.</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:13.545
<i>[Annie] People in the US work longer hours</i>
<i>than almost any industrialized country,</i>

20:13.629 --> 20:17.466
<i>depending on which data you look at,</i>
<i>but we work enormously long hours.</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:21.220
<i>We work as long hours</i>
<i>as people did during feudal society.</i>

20:21.303 --> 20:23.847
<i>We have such short vacations, if any.</i>

20:23.931 --> 20:26.183
<i>Half the country doesn't even take</i>
<i>two weeks of vacation.</i>

20:26.266 --> 20:28.560
<i>We're commuting longer hours</i>
<i>than ever before,</i>

20:28.644 --> 20:32.814
<i>and then we're spending more time alone</i>
<i>in front of screens than ever before.</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:36.235
<i>We're losing the stuff</i>
<i>that actually makes us happy</i>

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
<i>and makes society more safe and secure,</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:39.863
<i>which is community.</i>

20:40.364 --> 20:41.865
<i>Um, we're losing that</i>

20:41.949 --> 20:45.244
<i>and changing that time</i>
<i>to work and buy more stuff.</i>

20:46.119 --> 20:50.874
<i>[Erwin] What you don't want in your life</i>
<i>is this endless horizon of aspiration.</i>

20:50.958 --> 20:53.460
<i>"I just need a bit more of this</i>
<i>or a little bit more of that.</i>

20:53.543 --> 20:55.879
<i>I need more success,</i>
<i>more income, more wealth,</i>

20:55.963 --> 21:00.592
<i>a bigger house, bigger car, bigger this,"</i>
<i>because that's just an endless black hole.</i>

21:00.676 --> 21:03.303
<i>When we get all of the things</i>
<i>that we want,</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:08.225
<i>we tend to be wrong in the predictions</i>
<i>that we made about how happy we would be,</i>

21:08.308 --> 21:10.727
<i>because the brain normalizes those things.</i>

21:10.811 --> 21:13.230
<i>After a few months of that,</i>
<i>you normalize it,</i>

21:13.313 --> 21:15.899
<i>and you say,</i>
<i>"All right, that was great at the time,</i>

21:15.983 --> 21:19.319
<i>but now I have a new set of desires,</i>
<i>a new set of dreams,"</i>

21:19.403 --> 21:21.571
<i>and everything that is the ceiling today</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:25.993
<i>becomes just the ground floor</i>
<i>for a new level you're trying to get to.</i>

21:26.076 --> 21:29.913
<i>And so, really what the American dream is</i>
<i>is this sense of freedom.</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:33.250
<i>Now how do you get that?</i>
<i>Just by gathering up more money?</i>

21:33.333 --> 21:34.251
<i>Nope, won't do it.</i>

21:34.876 --> 21:36.920
<i>Not if you gather up yet more stuff</i>

21:37.546 --> 21:40.507
<i>to go with your more money,</i>
<i>because you're still gonna be teetering.</i>

21:40.590 --> 21:43.385
<i>You just added zeros to your stupidity</i>
<i>is all you did then.</i>

21:43.468 --> 21:48.807
<i>And so, what happens is you have to learn</i>
<i>to contract your, in quotes, "needs,"</i>

21:48.890 --> 21:52.269
<i>so that you can create</i>
<i>a buffer around your life</i>

21:52.352 --> 21:54.855
<i>and create this independence</i>
<i>to where you've got enough savings</i>

21:54.938 --> 21:58.066
<i>that you can say, "Take this job</i>
<i>and shove it," if you need to.</i>

21:58.150 --> 22:00.652
<i>You don't have a bunch of debt</i>
<i>pounding down on your head,</i>

22:00.736 --> 22:03.613
<i>buying things that you don't really need</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:05.490
<i>with money you don't really have</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:07.576
<i>to impress people</i>
<i>you don't even really like.</i>

22:07.659 --> 22:10.996
<i>And so, what you've done there</i>
<i>is you gave up your independence,</i>

22:11.079 --> 22:13.123
<i>you gave up your freedom…</i>

22:13.999 --> 22:16.626
<i>in return for some stuff</i>

22:16.710 --> 22:19.921
<i>that's gonna be worth nothing</i>
<i>in next year's garage sale.</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:24.009
<i>[Erwin] You almost have buyer's remorse,</i>
<i>and you also have this gambler's dilemma</i>

22:24.092 --> 22:26.428
<i>where you gambled for this</i>
<i>and now you have it.</i>

22:26.511 --> 22:29.431
<i>Do you want to give it up</i>
<i>even though it makes you unhappy?</i>

22:29.931 --> 22:32.100
<i>So I think a part of the process</i>
<i>for all of us</i>

22:32.184 --> 22:35.145
<i>is making sure we actually</i>
<i>are going after what we truly want.</i>

22:35.228 --> 22:38.273
<i>And when we have something,</i>
<i>to do an honest evaluation of going,</i>

22:38.357 --> 22:41.777
<i>"Is this something I want to define</i>
<i>my life? Do I really want to keep this?"</i>

22:44.738 --> 22:48.367
<i>[Ryan] Chasing the American dream,</i>
<i>it cost me so much more than money.</i>

22:48.450 --> 22:53.246
<i>My life was filled with stress,</i>
<i>and anxiety, and discontent.</i>

22:53.872 --> 22:57.501
<i>It got to a point in my life</i>
<i>where I didn't know what was important.</i>

22:57.584 --> 22:59.086
<i>But one thing was clear.</i>

22:59.586 --> 23:03.465
<i>I had this gaping void in my life.</i>

23:03.548 --> 23:09.221
<i>So I tried to fill that void</i>
<i>the same way many people do, with stuff.</i>

23:09.888 --> 23:13.975
<i>I continued to work 60, 70,</i>
<i>sometimes 80 hours a week,</i>

23:14.059 --> 23:17.396
<i>forsaking some of the most important</i>
<i>aspects of my life.</i>

23:17.479 --> 23:21.066
<i>I barely thought about my health,</i>
<i>or my relationships,</i>

23:21.149 --> 23:23.193
<i>or things that I was passionate about.</i>

23:23.276 --> 23:25.362
<i>I was living paycheck to paycheck.</i>

23:25.445 --> 23:27.322
<i>Living for a paycheck.</i>

23:27.406 --> 23:29.032
<i>Living for stuff.</i>

23:30.534 --> 23:33.161
<i>[Joshua] It's like I was swerving</i>
<i>from credit card purchases</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:34.913
<i>to reckless spending</i>

23:34.996 --> 23:40.335
<i>to accumulating debt to maintain</i>
<i>a lifestyle I didn't even enjoy.</i>

23:41.002 --> 23:44.506
<i>I had all of the stuff to fill</i>
<i>every corner of my consumer-driven life.</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:49.594
<i>Giant televisions, fine china,</i>
<i>stainless steel appliances,</i>

23:49.678 --> 23:53.932
<i>marble countertops,</i>
<i>expensive watches, tailored suits</i>

23:54.015 --> 23:57.978
<i>and more, and more, and so much more.</i>

23:59.271 --> 24:03.733
<i>Then, toward the end of 2008,</i>
<i>actually it was two days before Christmas,</i>

24:04.276 --> 24:05.610
<i>I got a phone call from Mom.</i>

24:06.528 --> 24:08.947
<i>She had just moved down to Florida</i>
<i>earlier that year</i>

24:09.030 --> 24:11.741
<i>to finally retire on Social Security.</i>

24:12.409 --> 24:18.081
<i>But on December 23rd, she found out</i>
<i>she had Stage IV lung cancer.</i>

24:19.916 --> 24:22.419
<i>And in less than a year, she was gone.</i>

24:23.587 --> 24:26.381
<i>I spent a lot of time with Mom</i>
<i>that year down in Florida</i>

24:26.465 --> 24:30.343
<i>as she struggled</i>
<i>through her chemo and radiation.</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:33.972
<i>But when she passed, I realized</i>
<i>I needed to make one last visit.</i>

24:34.681 --> 24:37.309
<i>And this time,</i>
<i>it was to deal with her stuff.</i>

24:38.310 --> 24:42.439
<i>So I flew from Dayton, Ohio,</i>
<i>down to St. Pete Beach, Florida.</i>

24:43.106 --> 24:45.192
<i>When I arrived, do you know what I found?</i>

24:57.662 --> 24:58.580
<i>Stuff.</i>

24:59.080 --> 25:03.668
<i>Like three houses worth of stuff crammed</i>
<i>into Mom's tiny one-bedroom apartment.</i>

25:03.752 --> 25:06.087
<i>Now, it's not like Mom was a hoarder.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:08.924
<i>I mean, I didn't find any dead cats</i>
<i>in her freezer.</i>

25:09.633 --> 25:11.551
<i>But she owned a lot of stuff.</i>

25:12.135 --> 25:14.638
<i>Sixty-five years' worth of accumulations.</i>

25:14.721 --> 25:16.681
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>the average American household</i>

25:16.765 --> 25:19.184
<i>has more than 300,000 items in it?</i>

25:19.601 --> 25:21.019
<i>300,000!</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:25.649
<i>Just take a look around at your average</i>
<i>basement, or attic, or garage.</i>

25:25.732 --> 25:26.608
<i>What do you see?</i>

25:26.691 --> 25:29.819
<i>Unused sporting goods, exercise equipment,</i>

25:29.903 --> 25:32.948
<i>camping gear, holiday decorations,</i>

25:33.031 --> 25:35.909
<i>musical instruments, spare parts,</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:37.911
<i>outdated electronics,</i>

25:37.994 --> 25:41.414
<i>random cords and miscellaneous cables,</i>

25:41.498 --> 25:45.043
<i>magazines, and cassette tapes,</i>
<i>and compact discs,</i>

25:45.126 --> 25:48.004
<i>tchotchkes, and knickknacks, and trinkets,</i>

25:48.088 --> 25:51.132
<i>and all the things</i>
<i>we forgot we even owned.</i>

25:51.216 --> 25:57.013
<i>Boxes, and bins,</i>
<i>and entire rooms stuffed with stuff.</i>

25:58.223 --> 26:01.768
<i>We had so much. So much stuff.</i>

26:01.851 --> 26:03.979
<i>My closet was out of control.</i>

26:04.062 --> 26:07.649
<i>So I had a closet full of clothes.</i>
<i>I had a dresser full of clothes.</i>

26:07.732 --> 26:10.652
<i>Photography equipment, bicycle equipment.</i>

26:10.735 --> 26:12.571
<i>Skin care products, beauty products.</i>

26:12.654 --> 26:14.447
<i>Shoes, purses.</i>

26:14.531 --> 26:16.700
<i>I'd open the closet, stuff would fall out.</i>

26:16.783 --> 26:19.244
<i>I don't know why,</i>
<i>but I had three soccer cleats,</i>

26:19.327 --> 26:22.163
<i>even though</i>
<i>I don't really even play soccer. [laughs]</i>

26:22.247 --> 26:25.125
<i>You know, things people had given me</i>
<i>throughout the years,</i>

26:25.208 --> 26:27.919
<i>whether those be cards, or objects,</i>

26:28.003 --> 26:31.298
<i>or tokens that I'd kept</i>
<i>from different events we'd gone to.</i>

26:31.381 --> 26:34.551
<i>But it was just a never-ending,</i>
<i>uh, you know, turnstile</i>

26:34.634 --> 26:36.595
<i>of, uh, "I need this. I need that."</i>

26:37.345 --> 26:39.139
<i>[woman] It's so easy to buy things</i>

26:39.222 --> 26:42.100
<i>that we think are the solution</i>
<i>to our problems.</i>

26:42.183 --> 26:46.187
<i>I remember when I had babies,</i>
<i>and I really wanted them to sleep well,</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:50.442
<i>and I thought I just needed the perfect</i>
<i>sleep device in order to make that happen.</i>

26:50.525 --> 26:53.069
<i>So I had probably</i>
<i>four different types of swaddles,</i>

26:53.153 --> 26:55.780
<i>multiple different types</i>
<i>of zip-up sleep devices.</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:59.451
<i>There are… If you go on Amazon,</i>
<i>you can find there are dozens and dozens</i>

26:59.534 --> 27:03.330
<i>of different types of mechanisms</i>
<i>to get babies to sleep.</i>

27:03.413 --> 27:05.498
<i>Pieces of equipment that you can buy.</i>

27:05.582 --> 27:10.712
<i>But the reality is that getting babies</i>
<i>to sleep is just really hard,</i>

27:10.795 --> 27:15.425
<i>and we can fall into this trap of trying</i>
<i>to buy our way out of the hard times.</i>

27:15.508 --> 27:19.304
<i>And it's… it's often not very successful</i>
<i>and very expensive.</i>

27:19.387 --> 27:22.515
<i>[T.K.] I actually think the best way</i>
<i>to know if you have too many things</i>

27:22.599 --> 27:25.852
<i>isn't by waiting to see</i>
<i>if you run out of room to keep them,</i>

27:25.935 --> 27:30.231
<i>but asking yourself if you've run out</i>
<i>of purposeful things to do with them.</i>

27:30.315 --> 27:32.609
<i>When you've run out of purposeful things</i>
<i>to do with things,</i>

27:32.692 --> 27:35.862
<i>even if you only have one thing,</i>
<i>you already have too many things.</i>

27:35.945 --> 27:40.784
<i>The reason we are so depressed</i>
<i>and so empty when we have so much</i>

27:41.534 --> 27:45.413
<i>is that if you get more</i>
<i>of the wrong thing, it becomes less.</i>

27:45.497 --> 27:47.999
<i>There are deeper things that…</i>
<i>that fulfill us.</i>

27:48.083 --> 27:50.210
<i>Our need for meaning,</i>
<i>our need for progress,</i>

27:50.293 --> 27:52.003
<i>our need for intimacy.</i>

27:52.629 --> 27:55.131
<i>The reason the message of minimalism</i>
<i>is so powerful</i>

27:55.215 --> 27:59.052
<i>is because we're bingeing</i>
<i>on all the wrong things,</i>

27:59.594 --> 28:03.098
<i>and we're dying of hunger</i>
<i>for the things that really matter.</i>

28:06.976 --> 28:10.438
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>most of us aren't hoarders, right?</i>

28:11.856 --> 28:12.941
<i>No.</i>

28:13.024 --> 28:14.943
<i>We just hold on to a lot of stuff.</i>

28:15.026 --> 28:17.445
<i>We hold on to a lifetime</i>
<i>of collected memories.</i>

28:18.071 --> 28:22.200
<i>I know Mom certainly did, and I had</i>
<i>no idea what to do with any of it.</i>

28:25.161 --> 28:27.580
<i>So I did what any good son would do.</i>

28:29.040 --> 28:29.958
<i>I called U-Haul.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:33.628
<i>I called U-Haul, and I asked</i>
<i>for the largest truck they had.</i>

28:33.712 --> 28:36.548
<i>In fact, I needed one so large</i>
<i>I had to wait an extra day</i>

28:36.631 --> 28:39.175
<i>until the 26-foot truck was available.</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:42.721
<i>As I waited for that U-Haul to arrive,</i>
<i>I invited some of Mom's friends over</i>

28:42.804 --> 28:44.597
<i>to help me sort through her stuff.</i>

28:44.681 --> 28:49.728
<i>I mean, there was just too much stuff</i>
<i>to go at it alone.</i>

28:50.395 --> 28:53.440
<i>Her living room was stuffed</i>
<i>with big antique furniture,</i>

28:53.523 --> 28:55.108
<i>and old paintings,</i>

28:55.191 --> 28:57.777
<i>and more doilies than I could count.</i>

28:57.861 --> 28:59.320
<i>And her kitchen was stuffed</i>

28:59.404 --> 29:01.698
<i>with hundreds of plates,</i>
<i>and cups, and bowls,</i>

29:01.781 --> 29:03.992
<i>and ill-assorted utensils.</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:06.494
<i>And her bathroom was stuffed</i>

29:06.578 --> 29:10.498
<i>with enough makeup,</i>
<i>and face creams, and hygiene products</i>

29:10.582 --> 29:13.001
<i>to start a small beauty supply business.</i>

29:13.084 --> 29:16.588
<i>And it looked like someone was running</i>
<i>a hotel out of her linen closet,</i>

29:16.671 --> 29:19.799
<i>which was stuffed</i>
<i>with mismatched bath towels,</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:21.926
<i>beach towels, and dish towels.</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:24.429
<i>Don't even get me started</i>
<i>on Mom's bedroom.</i>

29:24.512 --> 29:29.267
<i>I mean, why did Mom have 14 winter coats</i>
<i>stuffed into her bedroom closet?</i>

29:29.809 --> 29:33.271
<i>Come on. She lived in St. Pete Beach.</i>

29:35.732 --> 29:40.361
<i>So anyway, there I was attempting</i>
<i>to finish packing all of Mom's stuff</i>

29:40.445 --> 29:42.906
<i>when I looked under her bed.</i>

29:47.535 --> 29:51.623
<i>I noticed these four boxes,</i>
<i>these old printer paper boxes.</i>

29:51.706 --> 29:52.707
<i>Kind of heavy,</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:55.084
<i>sealed with excessive amounts</i>
<i>of packing tape.</i>

29:56.002 --> 29:57.670
<i>I noticed each box was labeled</i>

29:57.754 --> 30:00.757
<i>with just a number written on the side</i>
<i>in thick black marker.</i>

30:01.883 --> 30:02.926
<i>And I stood there…</i>

30:03.760 --> 30:04.677
<i>looking down…</i>

30:05.887 --> 30:09.224
<i>wondering what could possibly</i>
<i>be inside those boxes.</i>

30:14.020 --> 30:16.856
<i>Turns out it was</i>
<i>my old elementary school paperwork.</i>

30:17.690 --> 30:19.776
<i>Grades one through four.</i>

30:20.819 --> 30:23.321
<i>As I opened those boxes,</i>
<i>my curiosity ran wild,</i>

30:23.404 --> 30:27.325
<i>and I thought to myself, "Why was Mom</i>
<i>holding on to all that stupid paperwork?"</i>

30:28.076 --> 30:31.704
<i>But then all these memories</i>
<i>came rushing back, and it was obvious.</i>

30:34.582 --> 30:37.460
<i>Mom had been holding on to a piece of me.</i>

30:38.044 --> 30:41.589
<i>Mom was holding on to all the memories</i>
<i>inside those boxes. Right?</i>

30:41.673 --> 30:42.799
<i>But wait a minute.</i>

30:42.882 --> 30:45.760
<i>Those boxes had been sealed</i>
<i>for more than two decades.</i>

30:45.844 --> 30:50.849
<i>It was clear Mom hadn't been accessing</i>
<i>any of the memories inside those boxes,</i>

30:50.932 --> 30:54.394
<i>which helped me understand</i>
<i>something important for the first time.</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:58.231
<i>Our memories are not in our things.</i>

30:59.315 --> 31:01.317
<i>Our memories are inside us.</i>

31:01.401 --> 31:03.736
<i>You see,</i>
<i>Mom didn't need to hold on to those boxes</i>

31:03.820 --> 31:05.238
<i>to hold on to a piece of me.</i>

31:05.905 --> 31:07.699
<i>I was never inside those boxes.</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:12.412
<i>But then I looked around her apartment,</i>
<i>I looked around at all her stuff,</i>

31:12.495 --> 31:15.623
<i>and I realized I was getting ready</i>
<i>to do the same thing.</i>

31:15.707 --> 31:17.458
<i>If I'm being honest with myself,</i>

31:17.542 --> 31:20.503
<i>I was just gonna selfishly cling</i>
<i>to most of Mom's stuff.</i>

31:20.587 --> 31:23.172
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna get any real value from it</i>

31:23.256 --> 31:25.425
<i>as it sat there locked away in perpetuity.</i>

31:25.508 --> 31:27.468
<i>But the truth is that, by letting go,</i>

31:27.552 --> 31:29.929
<i>I realized I could add value</i>
<i>to other people's lives.</i>

31:30.013 --> 31:34.601
<i>So I donated most of her stuff</i>
<i>to her friends and to local charities,</i>

31:34.684 --> 31:37.478
<i>finding the stuff a new home.</i>

31:37.562 --> 31:39.439
<i>And the few items I was able to sell,</i>

31:39.522 --> 31:42.233
<i>I was able to take that money</i>
<i>and donate it to the two charities</i>

31:42.317 --> 31:45.278
<i>that helped Mom</i>
<i>through her chemo and radiation.</i>

31:46.195 --> 31:51.034
<i>You see, I realized</i>
<i>I could contribute beyond myself</i>

31:51.117 --> 31:53.119
<i>if I was willing to let go.</i>

31:54.871 --> 31:56.497
<i>When I finally returned to Ohio,</i>

31:56.581 --> 31:59.918
<i>I returned with just a handful</i>
<i>of sentimental items.</i>

32:00.001 --> 32:02.670
<i>An old painting, a few photographs,</i>

32:02.754 --> 32:04.589
<i>maybe even a doily or two,</i>

32:04.672 --> 32:08.009
<i>which helped me understand</i>
<i>that by having fewer sentimental items,</i>

32:08.092 --> 32:11.304
<i>we're able to enjoy</i>
<i>those sentimental items much more.</i>

32:11.387 --> 32:14.265
<i>I get far more value</i>
<i>from the few items I kept</i>

32:14.349 --> 32:18.561
<i>than if I were to water them down</i>
<i>with dozens or even hundreds of trinkets.</i>

32:18.645 --> 32:22.732
<i>Ultimately, I had to let go</i>
<i>of what was weighing me down</i>

32:22.815 --> 32:24.233
<i>before I could move on.</i>

32:24.776 --> 32:25.693
<i>To move on…</i>

32:26.569 --> 32:29.572
<i>I had to take an inventory of my own life.</i>

32:31.741 --> 32:35.078
<i>Turns out I had an organized life.</i>

32:35.662 --> 32:38.748
<i>But really,</i>
<i>I was just a well-organized hoarder.</i>

32:38.831 --> 32:40.792
<i>And if you would've looked</i>
<i>beneath the surface,</i>

32:40.875 --> 32:43.878
<i>you would have found a lifetime</i>
<i>of unchecked consumption.</i>

32:44.504 --> 32:46.297
<i>As companies continue to innovate,</i>

32:46.381 --> 32:49.592
<i>our ability to show restraint</i>
<i>is getting more and more difficult.</i>

32:49.676 --> 32:50.885
<i>Outsourced labor</i>

32:50.969 --> 32:54.597
<i>combined with advancements</i>
<i>in shipping, manufacturing, and logistics</i>

32:54.681 --> 32:58.226
<i>has dropped the cost of consumer products</i>
<i>to an all-time low.</i>

32:58.309 --> 33:01.980
<i>And now, with one-click purchasing,</i>
<i>same-day delivery,</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:04.857
<i>and a society</i>
<i>that has normalized credit card debt,</i>

33:04.941 --> 33:06.901
<i>we've dug ourselves into a hole.</i>

33:07.694 --> 33:10.905
<i>The average American</i>
<i>carries four credit cards in their wallet</i>

33:10.989 --> 33:13.992
<i>and the average credit card debt</i>
<i>for indebted households</i>

33:14.075 --> 33:16.661
<i>is more than $16,000.</i>

33:16.744 --> 33:20.915
<i>Each year, we spend more</i>
<i>on shoes, jewelry, and watches</i>

33:20.999 --> 33:22.667
<i>than on higher education.</i>

33:23.376 --> 33:26.629
<i>[Denaye] I remember when I was a kid,</i>
<i>there was something called layaway.</i>

33:26.713 --> 33:29.465
<i>We'd go to the department store</i>
<i>and pick out our school clothes,</i>

33:29.549 --> 33:30.967
<i>and my mom would put it on layaway,</i>

33:31.050 --> 33:34.429
<i>which meant she would go and make payments</i>
<i>once a week for several weeks</i>

33:34.512 --> 33:37.432
<i>until she paid all of it off</i>
<i>when she had all the money paid in.</i>

33:37.515 --> 33:39.434
<i>That's when we got</i>
<i>to bring home the stuff.</i>

33:39.517 --> 33:42.687
<i>This concept does not exist now.</i>
<i>If you want the stuff,</i>

33:42.770 --> 33:44.939
<i>you put the credit card down</i>
<i>and take it right away.</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:48.484
<i>And I think that functional change</i>
<i>in the way that we buy</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:51.738
<i>has made a difference</i>
<i>in what our expectations are</i>

33:51.821 --> 33:54.574
<i>and a sort of sense of entitlement</i>
<i>about what we should have,</i>

33:54.657 --> 33:57.994
<i>and when we should have it,</i>
<i>and if we should have to wait for it.</i>

33:58.077 --> 34:02.373
<i>[Dave] America, sadly, has gotten</i>
<i>increasingly emotionally immature.</i>

34:02.457 --> 34:04.876
<i>"I want it, and I want it now,</i>

34:04.959 --> 34:07.128
<i>and I deserve it because I breathe air."</i>

34:07.754 --> 34:10.339
<i>This is a four-year-old child</i>
<i>in the cereal aisle</i>

34:10.423 --> 34:12.633
<i>throwing a fit</i>
<i>because they can't have Froot Loops.</i>

34:13.426 --> 34:16.888
<i>And yet it's a 54-year-old woman</i>
<i>I'm talking to or man I'm talking to,</i>

34:16.971 --> 34:19.265
<i>'cause he can't buy</i>
<i>this little item he wants,</i>

34:19.348 --> 34:21.267
<i>'cause he doesn't have the money.</i>

34:21.350 --> 34:25.354
<i>Guess what? You're never gonna have</i>
<i>the money for everything you want.</i>

34:26.105 --> 34:29.942
<i>[T.K.] The kind of debt that creates</i>
<i>the most problems in our society</i>

34:30.026 --> 34:34.072
<i>comes from a felt need</i>
<i>to keep up with appearances.</i>

34:34.155 --> 34:40.286
<i>Placing unnecessary burdens on yourself</i>
<i>in order to maintain some kind of image.</i>

34:40.369 --> 34:43.414
<i>If I can't afford a BMW,</i>

34:43.498 --> 34:46.626
<i>but I go into debt</i>
<i>in order to acquire one,</i>

34:46.709 --> 34:50.296
<i>I'm doing that because</i>
<i>I-I want the… the social rewards, right,</i>

34:50.379 --> 34:53.508
<i>of… of being seen</i>
<i>as a certain kind of person.</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:55.510
<i>Once your basic needs are met,</i>

34:55.593 --> 34:58.805
<i>the way that we as humans</i>
<i>determine what is enough</i>

34:58.888 --> 35:01.140
<i>is relative to the people around us.</i>

35:01.224 --> 35:04.602
<i>Um, and so, that's where the saying</i>
<i>"keeping up with the Joneses" came up.</i>

35:04.685 --> 35:07.313
<i>We judge our furniture,</i>
<i>our clothes, our car</i>

35:07.396 --> 35:09.398
<i>based on the people around us.</i>

35:09.482 --> 35:13.486
<i>It used to be that the people around us</i>
<i>were of similar socioeconomic background.</i>

35:13.569 --> 35:16.114
<i>So we were like, "It's cool.</i>
<i>We all got the same stuff."</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:19.742
<i>But now, with the onslaught</i>
<i>of television and social media,</i>

35:19.826 --> 35:23.329
<i>they have what's called the vertical</i>
<i>expansion of our reference group.</i>

35:23.412 --> 35:26.332
<i>Now I'm comparing my hair</i>
<i>to Jennifer Aniston's.</i>

35:26.415 --> 35:28.709
<i>Now I'm comparing my house</i>
<i>to Kim Kardashian's.</i>

35:28.793 --> 35:33.214
<i>I think that we are more stressed</i>
<i>and discontented today than ever before,</i>

35:33.297 --> 35:36.592
<i>because we know so much more,</i>
<i>or we think we know so much more,</i>

35:36.676 --> 35:40.388
<i>about what's going on inside of the house</i>
<i>of our neighbors and our friends.</i>

35:40.471 --> 35:44.851
<i>And the comparison is so much stronger</i>
<i>than in generations past,</i>

35:44.934 --> 35:48.771
<i>and we're constantly comparing our lives</i>
<i>to other people's lives.</i>

35:48.855 --> 35:51.524
<i>And when we do that,</i>
<i>it rarely measures up.</i>

35:51.607 --> 35:53.860
<i>This generation,</i>
<i>more than previous generations,</i>

35:53.943 --> 35:55.695
<i>we have to learn</i>
<i>how to manage our attention,</i>

35:55.778 --> 35:58.906
<i>because there are so many people</i>
<i>competing for it</i>

35:58.990 --> 36:02.034
<i>and telling us, like,</i>
<i>"Look at this, and you'll be happy!"</i>

36:02.118 --> 36:03.995
<i>"Buy this, and you'll be happy!"</i>

36:04.078 --> 36:07.290
<i>And you have to step back from all of that</i>
<i>and say, "No, no, no.</i>

36:07.373 --> 36:09.208
<i>I first need time</i>

36:09.292 --> 36:12.461
<i>to come up with my own ideas</i>
<i>about what's gonna make me happy."</i>

36:14.922 --> 36:17.175
<i>For me,</i>
<i>it all started with that one question.</i>

36:17.842 --> 36:21.387
<i>How might your life be better with less?</i>

36:21.470 --> 36:25.308
<i>By answering that question, I was able</i>
<i>to identify the purpose of minimalism.</i>

36:25.391 --> 36:29.687
<i>Not just the "how to,"</i>
<i>but the more important "why to."</i>

36:29.770 --> 36:31.606
<i>I realized, if I simplified my life,</i>

36:31.689 --> 36:35.318
<i>I'd have more time for my health,</i>
<i>my relationships,</i>

36:35.401 --> 36:37.403
<i>my creativity, my finances,</i>

36:37.486 --> 36:41.032
<i>and I could contribute beyond myself</i>
<i>in a meaningful way.</i>

36:41.115 --> 36:44.911
<i>You see, I was able to understand</i>
<i>the benefits of minimalism</i>

36:44.994 --> 36:47.830
<i>well before I ever cleaned out</i>
<i>a walk-in closet.</i>

36:47.914 --> 36:52.376
<i>And so, when it came time for me</i>
<i>to actually declutter, I started small.</i>

36:52.460 --> 36:54.378
<i>I asked myself another question.</i>

36:54.462 --> 36:57.798
<i>What if you removed</i>
<i>one material possession from your life</i>

36:57.882 --> 37:00.718
<i>each day for a month?</i>
<i>Just one. What would happen?</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:05.473
<i>Let me tell you. I got rid of way more</i>
<i>than 30 items in the first 30 days.</i>

37:05.556 --> 37:07.516
<i>Like way, way more.</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:11.520
<i>It became this kind of personal challenge,</i>
<i>discovering what I could get rid of.</i>

37:11.604 --> 37:15.483
<i>So I searched my rooms and closets,</i>
<i>my cabinets and hallways,</i>

37:15.566 --> 37:17.235
<i>my car and office,</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:19.403
<i>rummaging for items to part with,</i>

37:19.487 --> 37:23.324
<i>retaining only the things</i>
<i>that added value to my life.</i>

37:24.575 --> 37:27.161
<i>Pondering each artifact</i>
<i>in my home, I'd ask,</i>

37:27.662 --> 37:30.039
<i>"Does this thing add value to my life?"</i>

37:30.831 --> 37:33.834
<i>The more I asked this question,</i>
<i>the more I gained momentum</i>

37:33.918 --> 37:36.879
<i>and embracing minimalism</i>
<i>got easier by the day.</i>

37:37.588 --> 37:40.925
<i>The more you do it, the freer,</i>
<i>and happier, and lighter you feel,</i>

37:41.008 --> 37:42.551
<i>and the more you wanna throw overboard.</i>

37:42.635 --> 37:45.304
<i>For me, a few shirts led to half a closet.</i>

37:45.388 --> 37:50.476
<i>A few DVDs led to deep-sixing</i>
<i>an entire library of unused discs.</i>

37:50.559 --> 37:51.936
<i>A few decorative items</i>

37:52.019 --> 37:54.814
<i>led to junk drawers</i>
<i>who shed their adjective.</i>

37:54.897 --> 37:59.318
<i>It's a beautiful cycle. The more action</i>
<i>you take, the more you wanna take action.</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:03.197
<i>Once I started to get rid of stuff,</i>

38:03.281 --> 38:05.491
<i>it was just like the momentum</i>
<i>just took over.</i>

38:05.574 --> 38:08.452
<i>It was a snowball that I could not stop.</i>

38:08.536 --> 38:11.455
<i>I was ready to throw out</i>
<i>as many things as possible.</i>

38:11.539 --> 38:15.042
<i>[Rechna] When you open up those drawers</i>
<i>and look at what's in the back of them,</i>

38:15.126 --> 38:17.003
<i>I don't think I even realized</i>

38:17.086 --> 38:20.548
<i>half the stuff that we had</i>
<i>hidden away in closets and in drawers.</i>

38:20.631 --> 38:24.593
<i>[Victor] It… It really helped by focusing</i>
<i>on just one part of the house,</i>

38:24.677 --> 38:25.928
<i>instead of just thinking,</i>

38:26.012 --> 38:30.141
<i>"Oh, wow, I have 35 years of things</i>
<i>in my house that I need to get rid of."</i>

38:30.224 --> 38:33.019
<i>[Michael] We got rid</i>
<i>of our storage rental.</i>

38:33.102 --> 38:35.980
<i>A huge storage rental</i>
<i>that we'd been paying for for years</i>

38:36.063 --> 38:38.691
<i>and didn't really even know</i>
<i>what was in there, gone.</i>

38:38.774 --> 38:41.610
<i>I remember going through my CD collection,</i>

38:41.694 --> 38:45.614
<i>and I couldn't even remember</i>
<i>if I had a CD player in my car.</i>

38:45.698 --> 38:49.076
<i>That was the one thing that made me think,</i>
<i>"That's probably a reason</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:53.581
<i>for me not to hold on to these CDs anymore</i>
<i>if I don't even know if I can play them."</i>

38:53.664 --> 38:56.625
<i>As I began to get rid of things,</i>

38:56.709 --> 39:00.629
<i>one at a time, I just felt so much freer.</i>

39:00.713 --> 39:01.797
<i>There was freedom.</i>

39:01.881 --> 39:04.967
<i>When I started going through it,</i>
<i>I got rid of 14 pairs of pants.</i>

39:05.051 --> 39:06.635
<i>I couldn't believe</i>
<i>how high the stack was.</i>

39:06.719 --> 39:09.680
<i>And so, I actually, you know,</i>
<i>went through and counted them,</i>

39:09.764 --> 39:12.516
<i>and I'm like,</i>
<i>"14 pairs of pants sitting in the closet!"</i>

39:12.600 --> 39:14.143
<i>[Michael] We put our house up for sale,</i>

39:14.226 --> 39:17.146
<i>because</i>
<i>we just wanted to really start fresh</i>

39:17.229 --> 39:19.690
<i>and just grab life, you know, and…</i>

39:19.774 --> 39:20.733
<i>and really be free.</i>

39:20.816 --> 39:24.570
<i>It was a very freeing feeling, um,</i>
<i>to just get started,</i>

39:24.653 --> 39:26.405
<i>and so I… I ran with it.</i>

39:29.367 --> 39:32.536
<i>[Joshua] Over the course of eight months</i>
<i>after my mother died,</i>

39:32.620 --> 39:36.916
<i>I deliberately jettisoned</i>
<i>more than 90% of my material possessions.</i>

39:36.999 --> 39:40.920
<i>Although, if you visited my home today,</i>
<i>you probably wouldn't walk in and say,</i>

39:41.837 --> 39:42.755
<i>"Oh, my God!</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:45.800
<i>This guy's a minimalist!"</i>

39:46.634 --> 39:51.180
<i>No, you'd probably just ask</i>
<i>how we keep things so organized,</i>

39:51.764 --> 39:54.850
<i>and I'd just tell you</i>
<i>that my family and I, we don't own much,</i>

39:54.934 --> 39:58.354
<i>but everything we do own</i>
<i>adds real value to our lives.</i>

39:58.437 --> 40:00.398
<i>Each of our belongings,</i>

40:00.481 --> 40:04.193
<i>our clothes, our car,</i>
<i>our kitchenware, our furniture</i>

40:04.276 --> 40:05.403
<i>has a function.</i>

40:05.945 --> 40:09.073
<i>As a minimalist,</i>
<i>every possession serves a purpose</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:12.410
<i>or it brings me joy,</i>
<i>and everything else is out of the way.</i>

40:13.119 --> 40:14.787
<i>With all that clutter cleared, I…</i>

40:14.870 --> 40:18.082
<i>I finally felt compelled</i>
<i>to start asking deeper questions.</i>

40:18.707 --> 40:22.086
<i>Questions like,</i>
<i>"When did I give so much meaning</i>

40:22.169 --> 40:23.921
<i>to all these material possessions?</i>

40:24.672 --> 40:26.799
<i>What is truly important in my life?</i>

40:27.716 --> 40:29.468
<i>Why have I been so discontented?</i>

40:30.261 --> 40:34.598
<i>Who is the person I want to become,</i>
<i>and how will I define my own success?"</i>

40:35.182 --> 40:39.145
<i>Now, these… these are tough questions</i>
<i>with difficult answers,</i>

40:39.687 --> 40:43.524
<i>but they've proven to be more important</i>
<i>than just trashing my excess stuff.</i>

40:43.607 --> 40:47.945
<i>And if we don't answer these questions</i>
<i>carefully, rigorously…</i>

40:48.779 --> 40:51.615
<i>then those closets</i>
<i>that we just decluttered</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:54.952
<i>will be brimming with new purchases</i>
<i>in the not-too-distant future.</i>

40:56.579 --> 40:57.663
<i>So, as I let go…</i>

40:58.581 --> 41:01.917
<i>and as I started facing</i>
<i>some of life's tougher questions…</i>

41:03.043 --> 41:05.171
<i>my life got simpler.</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:08.591
<i>The people around me</i>
<i>noticed something was different too.</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:12.428
<i>My best friend,</i>
<i>a guy named Ryan Nicodemus,</i>

41:12.511 --> 41:15.222
<i>whom I've known</i>
<i>since we were fat little fifth-graders…</i>

41:15.931 --> 41:18.476
<i>-he came to me one day and said…</i>
<i>-[thunder rumbles]</i>

41:18.559 --> 41:20.478
<i>[Joshua] "Why the hell are you so happy?"</i>

41:21.812 --> 41:23.731
<i>So I told him</i>
<i>about this thing called minimalism.</i>

41:24.398 --> 41:27.610
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"What the hell is minimalism?"</i>

41:28.110 --> 41:32.740
<i>And so I said, "Minimalism</i>
<i>is the thing that gets us past the things,</i>

41:32.823 --> 41:35.868
<i>so we can make room</i>
<i>for life's most important things,</i>

41:35.951 --> 41:39.580
<i>which actually aren't things at all.</i>

41:40.498 --> 41:41.499
<i>You know what, Ryan?</i>

41:41.582 --> 41:44.835
<i>I think you might benefit</i>
<i>from this minimalism thing too, because…</i>

41:46.462 --> 41:49.006
<i>Well, because you've got a lot of shit."</i>

41:52.259 --> 41:53.594
<i>[engine turns over]</i>

41:53.677 --> 41:55.554
<i>[Ryan] That's when I remember really…</i>

41:56.222 --> 41:59.475
<i>really looking at what you were</i>
<i>doing different with your life.</i>

41:59.558 --> 42:03.020
<i>Like, I had to find out, like,</i>
<i>"Okay, what is Josh doing differently?"</i>

42:03.103 --> 42:06.524
<i>Because my life was so out of control.</i>
<i>I needed to make a change.</i>

42:06.607 --> 42:08.943
<i>You obviously had made some changes,</i>
<i>so that's…</i>

42:09.026 --> 42:12.738
<i>I remember that's when I invited you</i>
<i>for that really fancy lunch at Subway.</i>

42:12.821 --> 42:15.533
<i>-Yeah. [chuckles]</i>
<i>-And, uh, we sat down and…</i>

42:16.492 --> 42:17.701
<i>had… had our sandwiches,</i>

42:17.785 --> 42:21.497
<i>and I just remember asking you,</i>
<i>like, "Why the hell are you so happy?"</i>

42:21.997 --> 42:24.667
<i>And, you know, if it wasn't you</i>

42:24.750 --> 42:27.002
<i>-who told me about minimalism…</i>
<i>-[Joshua] Uh-huh.</i>

42:27.086 --> 42:30.506
<i>[Ryan] If it was anyone else, I don't know</i>
<i>if I would have been so quick</i>

42:31.006 --> 42:33.759
<i>to be willing to try it out.</i>

42:34.760 --> 42:36.971
<i>As we were sitting there,</i>
<i>having our lunch,</i>

42:37.763 --> 42:41.267
<i>he talked about how he'd spent</i>
<i>the last several months simplifying.</i>

42:42.142 --> 42:43.310
<i>Clearing the clutter.</i>

42:43.894 --> 42:46.981
<i>Making room</i>
<i>for life's most important things.</i>

42:47.064 --> 42:50.025
<i>So me, being the problem solver that I am,</i>

42:50.568 --> 42:53.404
<i>I decided to become a minimalist</i>
<i>right there on the spot.</i>

42:53.487 --> 42:55.948
<i>I looked up at Josh,</i>
<i>and I excitedly announced,</i>

42:56.448 --> 43:01.203
<i>"All right, man, I'm in. I'll do it!</i>
<i>I'm going to become a minimalist.</i>

43:03.205 --> 43:04.081
<i>Now what?"</i>

43:04.164 --> 43:06.625
<i>You see, I didn't want to spend</i>
<i>several months</i>

43:06.709 --> 43:09.169
<i>slowly paring down, like he had.</i>

43:09.253 --> 43:13.007
<i>I mean, that was great for him,</i>
<i>but I wanted faster results.</i>

43:13.090 --> 43:16.427
<i>So, we came up with a wild idea</i>
<i>called a packing party.</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:20.723
<i>We decided to pack all my belongings</i>
<i>as if I were moving.</i>

43:20.806 --> 43:25.686
<i>Then I would unpack only the items</i>
<i>I needed over the next three weeks.</i>

43:25.769 --> 43:29.773
<i>So Josh came over, and he literally</i>
<i>helped me box up everything.</i>

43:29.857 --> 43:33.777
<i>My clothes, my kitchenware,</i>
<i>my towels, my TVs,</i>

43:33.861 --> 43:37.615
<i>my electronics, my framed photographs</i>
<i>and paintings, my toiletries.</i>

43:37.698 --> 43:41.493
<i>Everything.</i>
<i>We literally pretended like I was moving.</i>

43:41.577 --> 43:45.122
<i>So after nine hours</i>
<i>and a couple of pizza deliveries,</i>

43:45.205 --> 43:48.792
<i>there Josh and I were,</i>
<i>sitting in my second living room,</i>

43:48.876 --> 43:52.880
<i>staring at these boxes</i>
<i>stacked halfway to my 12 ft. ceiling.</i>

43:52.963 --> 43:54.506
<i>Everything I owned,</i>

43:55.007 --> 43:58.844
<i>everything I had worked so hard for</i>
<i>over the last decade,</i>

43:58.927 --> 44:00.971
<i>it was all sitting there in that room.</i>

44:01.055 --> 44:05.476
<i>Just boxes stacked on top of boxes</i>
<i>stacked on top of boxes.</i>

44:06.060 --> 44:08.437
<i>Now each box was labeled really well</i>

44:08.520 --> 44:11.023
<i>so I'd know where to go</i>
<i>when I needed a particular item.</i>

44:11.106 --> 44:13.192
<i>Labels like "junk drawer,"</i>

44:13.275 --> 44:14.985
<i>"living room number one,"</i>

44:15.069 --> 44:16.278
<i>"kitchen utensils,"</i>

44:16.362 --> 44:17.946
<i>"junk drawer number seven."</i>

44:18.030 --> 44:22.910
<i>I spent the next 21 days</i>
<i>unpacking only the items I needed.</i>

44:22.993 --> 44:25.412
<i>My toothbrush, my bed and bed sheets,</i>

44:25.496 --> 44:27.039
<i>some clothes for work,</i>

44:27.122 --> 44:29.124
<i>the furniture I actually used,</i>

44:29.208 --> 44:30.376
<i>a tool set,</i>

44:30.459 --> 44:31.502
<i>some kitchenware.</i>

44:31.585 --> 44:35.297
<i>Just the things</i>
<i>that added value to my life.</i>

44:35.381 --> 44:37.007
<i>After three weeks…</i>

44:38.133 --> 44:40.052
<i>I had 80% of my stuff</i>

44:40.135 --> 44:43.055
<i>still sitting in those boxes.</i>

44:43.138 --> 44:46.308
<i>Just sitting there, un-accessed.</i>

44:47.017 --> 44:48.727
<i>You know, I looked at those boxes…</i>

44:49.228 --> 44:51.438
<i>I couldn't even remember</i>
<i>what was in most of 'em.</i>

44:52.314 --> 44:55.859
<i>All those things I brought into my life</i>
<i>to make me happy…</i>

44:57.027 --> 44:58.612
<i>they weren't doing their job.</i>

44:58.696 --> 45:01.699
<i>So that's when I decided to let go.</i>
<i>And you know what?</i>

45:02.741 --> 45:06.203
<i>I started to feel free</i>
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>

45:06.787 --> 45:08.288
<i>I got my time back.</i>

45:09.415 --> 45:10.749
<i>I got my life back.</i>

45:11.667 --> 45:14.086
<i>And as I changed my life,</i>

45:14.169 --> 45:17.256
<i>I was focused on community,</i>
<i>not consumerism.</i>

45:18.048 --> 45:20.008
<i>Giving, not taking.</i>

45:21.051 --> 45:22.928
<i>People, not stuff.</i>

45:23.637 --> 45:27.975
<i>It just made us really,</i>
<i>you know, reassess our lives,</i>

45:28.058 --> 45:30.352
<i>reassess our goals and our commitments.</i>

45:30.436 --> 45:36.442
<i>Friends, and family, and colleagues</i>
<i>have acknowledged a profound change in me.</i>

45:36.525 --> 45:38.318
<i>It's given me the opportunity</i>

45:38.402 --> 45:42.197
<i>to be that person</i>
<i>that I used to just talk about being.</i>

45:42.281 --> 45:46.326
<i>Because of the way that my values</i>
<i>have really been reorganized,</i>

45:46.869 --> 45:50.122
<i>I am grateful for every single second.</i>

45:50.706 --> 45:53.917
<i>Really, I began to find myself again.</i>

45:54.668 --> 45:58.213
<i>And for that, I am so thankful.</i>

45:58.297 --> 45:59.423
<i>Minimalism…</i>

46:01.008 --> 46:02.384
<i>it changed my life.</i>

46:02.468 --> 46:05.888
<i>This emotion washed over me.</i>
<i>You know, it was really overwhelming.</i>

46:05.971 --> 46:11.477
<i>And it was this feeling</i>
<i>of great abundance, you know.</i>

46:11.560 --> 46:15.147
<i>Like an abundance</i>
<i>where everything is fine.</i>

46:15.230 --> 46:18.066
<i>You have everything that you need,</i>
<i>all is well.</i>

46:18.150 --> 46:19.359
<i>And I don't think I'd…</i>

46:20.486 --> 46:22.780
<i>I get emotional</i>
<i>thinking back to it, right.</i>

46:22.863 --> 46:24.156
<i>[sniffles] Um…</i>

46:24.740 --> 46:28.869
<i>I don't think I had that feeling since</i>
<i>I was maybe four or five years old, so…</i>

46:30.287 --> 46:34.082
<i>This just deep knowing,</i>
<i>you know, that all I wanted,</i>

46:34.166 --> 46:36.543
<i>you know, all I was searching for,</i>
<i>all I needed…</i>

46:37.419 --> 46:38.462
<i>I already had it.</i>

46:40.798 --> 46:43.342
<i>[Ryan] A little over a year</i>
<i>after my packing party experiment,</i>

46:43.425 --> 46:45.636
<i>something unexpected happened.</i>

46:45.719 --> 46:47.596
<i>My boss called me on a Friday morning</i>

46:47.679 --> 46:50.432
<i>and told me to drive down</i>
<i>to Cincinnati that afternoon</i>

46:50.516 --> 46:53.227
<i>to meet him</i>
<i>at the company's Human Resources office.</i>

46:53.310 --> 46:56.104
<i>I walked into the conference room</i>
<i>and saw my boss</i>

46:56.188 --> 46:59.650
<i>and someone from HR sitting</i>
<i>on the other side of the conference table.</i>

46:59.733 --> 47:01.568
<i>My boss shook his head.</i>

47:02.069 --> 47:03.654
<i>"We've eliminated your position</i>

47:03.737 --> 47:05.948
<i>with the latest round of cuts,"</i>
<i>my boss said.</i>

47:06.031 --> 47:08.492
<i>"This change, it's effective immediately."</i>

47:08.575 --> 47:11.912
<i>After seven promotions</i>
<i>in less than a decade,</i>

47:11.995 --> 47:13.956
<i>I was laid off with no notice.</i>

47:14.039 --> 47:16.500
<i>And then I was surprised</i>
<i>by my next thought.</i>

47:17.167 --> 47:19.920
<i>"Isn't this the best thing</i>
<i>that could have happened?"</i>

47:20.003 --> 47:22.756
<i>It was like a huge weight</i>
<i>had been lifted off my shoulders.</i>

47:22.840 --> 47:25.300
<i>I knew it was time for me to move on,</i>

47:25.384 --> 47:27.344
<i>and this was the nudge I needed.</i>

47:27.427 --> 47:29.346
<i>My entire perspective had changed.</i>

47:29.847 --> 47:33.183
<i>And then I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"There might be some people out there</i>

47:33.267 --> 47:35.310
<i>who would find value in my story.</i>

47:35.894 --> 47:38.438
<i>Who would find value in our story."</i>

47:39.273 --> 47:43.902
<i>So Josh and I, we decided to do</i>
<i>what any two 30-year-old dudes would do.</i>

47:44.862 --> 47:46.113
<i>We started a blog.</i>

47:47.281 --> 47:48.615
<i>That was a decade ago.</i>

47:48.699 --> 47:51.159
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>Something amazing happened.</i>

47:51.243 --> 47:55.038
<i>Fifty-two people visited our website</i>
<i>in the first month.</i>

47:55.122 --> 47:57.916
<i>I realize</i>
<i>that might sound unremarkable at first,</i>

47:58.000 --> 48:00.460
<i>but Josh and I, we were excited.</i>

48:00.544 --> 48:03.130
<i>And then other remarkable things</i>
<i>started happening.</i>

48:03.213 --> 48:07.634
<i>Fifty-two readers turned into 500,</i>
<i>500 turned into 5,000</i>

48:07.718 --> 48:09.595
<i>and now we have the privilege</i>

48:09.678 --> 48:13.181
<i>of sharing our message</i>
<i>with millions of people every year.</i>

48:13.265 --> 48:15.767
<i>It turns out,</i>
<i>when you add value to people's lives,</i>

48:15.851 --> 48:19.563
<i>they're pretty eager to share your story</i>
<i>with their friends and family</i>

48:19.646 --> 48:21.690
<i>to add value to their lives.</i>

48:22.524 --> 48:24.526
<i>It's fitting that we're back here.</i>

48:24.610 --> 48:28.614
<i>Not just in Dayton,</i>
<i>but here at Press, at this coffee shop,</i>

48:28.697 --> 48:31.074
<i>because this is</i>
<i>where it literally started for us.</i>

48:31.158 --> 48:33.285
<i>Even back</i>
<i>when we were in the corporate world,</i>

48:33.368 --> 48:36.455
<i>you and I would meet here,</i>
<i>and this was our place for creation.</i>

48:36.538 --> 48:41.877
<i>It was almost like we required this extra</i>
<i>space outside of the corporate world,</i>

48:41.960 --> 48:44.254
<i>outside of our cluttered personal lives,</i>

48:44.338 --> 48:49.384
<i>to come here, to figure out how to create,</i>
<i>how to simplify our lives.</i>

48:49.468 --> 48:52.429
<i>To take this sort of feeling</i>
<i>that we were experiencing</i>

48:52.512 --> 48:54.389
<i>and get it down onto the page.</i>

48:55.057 --> 48:58.769
<i>[Erwin] I think we should all be allowed</i>
<i>to Etch A Sketch our life and say,</i>

48:58.852 --> 49:01.313
<i>"I thought this is the life I wanted,</i>
<i>but it's not,</i>

49:01.396 --> 49:03.148
<i>and so I'm gonna start over again."</i>

49:03.231 --> 49:06.485
<i>If you have a longing, and a dream,</i>
<i>and a passion inside of you,</i>

49:07.277 --> 49:10.781
<i>why hold on to what you used to do</i>
<i>and who you used to be</i>

49:11.406 --> 49:14.701
<i>and… and lose who you want to become?</i>

49:14.785 --> 49:17.621
<i>No matter where we're at</i>
<i>on our journey towards less,</i>

49:17.704 --> 49:20.457
<i>we are always going to be pulled</i>
<i>in that direction.</i>

49:20.540 --> 49:24.836
<i>The direction of comparison, the direction</i>
<i>of being overwhelmed by the media.</i>

49:25.420 --> 49:28.674
<i>And the truth is</i>
<i>we have to constantly refocus ourselves.</i>

49:28.757 --> 49:31.385
<i>We make life unnecessarily complicated</i>

49:31.468 --> 49:35.514
<i>because we overlook or underestimate</i>

49:35.597 --> 49:38.433
<i>the… the sense of direction that can come</i>

49:38.517 --> 49:42.270
<i>from just taking a little time</i>
<i>to sit alone with ourselves,</i>

49:42.354 --> 49:43.897
<i>to sit in the quiet and say,</i>

49:43.981 --> 49:46.858
<i>"I'm not gonna get my ideas</i>
<i>about what a good life is</i>

49:46.942 --> 49:49.611
<i>from external sources of stimulation.</i>

49:49.695 --> 49:53.281
<i>I'm gonna listen to that inner voice</i>
<i>and see where that's guiding me."</i>

49:53.365 --> 49:57.411
<i>[Erwin] If people could just</i>
<i>make a decision to be fully alive,</i>

49:57.494 --> 50:01.707
<i>if they could just get rid of everything</i>
<i>that's sucking the life out of their soul,</i>

50:01.790 --> 50:04.126
<i>that's when you're gonna find</i>
<i>your passion.</i>

50:04.209 --> 50:07.504
<i>But your passion</i>
<i>will never be about yourself.</i>

50:08.005 --> 50:12.009
<i>Your passion will always be</i>
<i>about some good you can do in the world.</i>

50:13.260 --> 50:16.471
<i>That's why Josh and I</i>
<i>are right here right now.</i>

50:16.555 --> 50:18.974
<i>We really hope</i>
<i>we can add value to your life</i>

50:19.057 --> 50:20.684
<i>by encouraging you to let go.</i>

50:21.184 --> 50:23.020
<i>To imagine a life with more.</i>

50:23.562 --> 50:26.565
<i>More time, more meaningful relationships,</i>

50:26.648 --> 50:29.735
<i>more growth,</i>
<i>and contribution, and contentment.</i>

50:29.818 --> 50:31.653
<i>A life of passion,</i>

50:31.737 --> 50:35.282
<i>unencumbered by the trappings</i>
<i>of the chaotic world around you.</i>

50:36.575 --> 50:39.911
<i>What you're imagining</i>
<i>is an intentional life.</i>

50:41.079 --> 50:42.330
<i>Not a perfect life.</i>

50:42.914 --> 50:44.124
<i>Not even an easy life.</i>

50:45.000 --> 50:46.001
<i>But a simple one.</i>

50:46.918 --> 50:51.798
<i>And to get there, you might have to let go</i>
