MONEY TRAIN

02:33.309 --> 02:36.678
Merry Christmas.

02:46.530 --> 02:50.030
Watch it!

03:12.932 --> 03:16.348
Thank you very much.

03:28.531 --> 03:32.908
We wish you a Merry Christmas ...

03:39.166 --> 03:44.671
- Check this dude.
- He looks like the Five-0.

03:52.305 --> 03:55.424
Are you a cop?

03:55.600 --> 03:59.929
He's no Five-0. He's been drinking.

04:01.647 --> 04:05.396
He's checking out the D.

04:05.568 --> 04:12.946
We have two Hispanic males.
Let's see if they end the game.

04:14.869 --> 04:20.704
- This looks familiar.
- He's got a slice. Stay alert.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.791
He's got my ring.

04:25.963 --> 04:29.166
Shit! He's wearing my watch.

04:29.342 --> 04:33.838
Nobody go
until you see him pull his lapel.

04:36.724 --> 04:41.185
- Shit!
- Fucking white boy!

04:50.363 --> 04:52.439
Stay!

04:52.615 --> 04:55.236
Get out of my way!

04:57.912 --> 05:02.159
Move!

05:02.333 --> 05:07.410
- Get out of the way!
- Come on, grandma.

05:09.006 --> 05:14.879
- No laying down on the job!
- I'm glad my pain amuses you.

05:15.054 --> 05:17.379
Come on. Move!

05:18.766 --> 05:21.601
T.A.!

05:29.568 --> 05:34.645
Slow down.
You've got cops down there?

05:34.824 --> 05:42.202
All trains north and south of
Wall Street Station stop and stay.

05:53.801 --> 05:58.593
- Doesn't he ever sleep?
- Yeah, during the day. In a coffin.

05:58.764 --> 06:05.099
- You're stopping trains. Why?
- We've got cops in the tunnel.

06:05.271 --> 06:09.399
- Where is the revenue train?
- At Wall Street.

06:09.567 --> 06:14.229
- Send it through.
- We've got cops on the track.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.192
Nothing stops the money train.

06:40.514 --> 06:43.800
- The money train!
- I've got a new plan.

07:04.622 --> 07:07.327
Get out of my way!

07:13.297 --> 07:17.840
- Here's the cash.
- You sold a lot of tokens today.

07:20.304 --> 07:23.056
Watch it!

07:24.725 --> 07:28.675
- Freeze!
- They're not stopping.

07:41.742 --> 07:45.870
- I don't believe this shit!
- We're cops.

07:46.038 --> 07:50.285
- Back up, men.
- Look. it's the Transit Twins.

07:50.459 --> 07:55.620
- Did you have to shoot him?
- He's a fucking kid.

07:57.174 --> 08:02.761
- We're only following orders.
- Does he look like a train robber?

08:02.930 --> 08:05.884
Don't try to hang the blame on us.

08:06.058 --> 08:11.349
- You ran him down the track.
- What did you say?

08:11.522 --> 08:15.223
You're not gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

08:25.161 --> 08:28.115
Chief, the detectives are here.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.833
Sit down.

08:36.130 --> 08:41.836
- Don't bleed on my chair.
- No sir. Chief Patterson.

08:42.010 --> 08:48.298
That report says you're brothers.
You are a negro.

08:48.476 --> 08:52.176
He is white.
Is somebody trying to jack me off?

08:52.355 --> 08:57.978
- No. we're foster brothers.
- I ran away from this orphanage ...

08:58.152 --> 09:01.438
Shut up!

09:03.366 --> 09:11.112
Today, you caused my money train
to arrive 46 minutes late.

09:11.290 --> 09:17.126
When my train is late, I take it
as a personal sign of disrespect.

09:17.296 --> 09:23.299
The revenue collection of the entire
subway system is under my command.

09:23.469 --> 09:29.305
My train. My people. My money.

09:29.475 --> 09:35.810
No one dictates the movements
of that train without my permission.

09:35.982 --> 09:41.652
- Am I making myself clear?
- As a bell. sir. Your train.

09:44.365 --> 09:49.276
- Shut up!
- Yes. sir.

09:49.453 --> 09:52.158
Now ... any questions?

09:52.331 --> 09:57.918
Why did you send the train through
when you knew we were in the tunnel?

09:58.087 --> 10:02.548
Your situation last night
didn't affect me.

10:02.717 --> 10:06.549
Your men shot that kid to shit
over a rope chain.

10:06.721 --> 10:12.261
Yeah, they shot him to shit ... and
you can't buy publicity like that.

10:13.311 --> 10:16.561
That boy is a goddamn hero.

10:16.731 --> 10:21.558
Thanks to his sacrifice
the word went forth today:

10:21.736 --> 10:26.362
You fuck with my train
and I'll kill you!

10:26.532 --> 10:31.075
Now I'm gonna send one more message:
I don't like you.

10:31.245 --> 10:38.161
So don't fuck with my train again.
If you do, we will tangle ass ...

10:38.336 --> 10:41.787
... and you will lose.

10:43.299 --> 10:45.375
You're dismissed.

10:47.303 --> 10:52.724
I hate bastards like that.
You can't put a price on human life.

10:52.892 --> 10:58.645
- He's worried about his schedule.
- You know what I'd like to do?

10:58.814 --> 11:02.978
- Shoot him?
- No. I'd like to take his train.

11:03.152 --> 11:07.446
- Take the candy from the baby.
- You say the word.

11:07.615 --> 11:09.738
- Word.
- I'm there.

11:09.909 --> 11:13.360
- Let's do it.
- If I didn't have this badge ...

11:13.537 --> 11:17.156
- We're not nuns.
- We're not taking the train.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.500
Too late.

11:23.547 --> 11:30.380
- I sure miss the old neighbourhood.
- You should come back more often.

11:30.554 --> 11:35.015
- Are you coming in?
- No, I've got a date.

11:35.184 --> 11:41.472
With a girl ...
or a deck of cards?

11:41.649 --> 11:48.565
- Do you think I'm gambling again?
- Yeah, I can see it in your eyes.

11:48.739 --> 11:54.030
- You've got a suspicious mind.
- I know you.

11:54.203 --> 11:57.287
Have you got any cash?

11:57.456 --> 12:03.826
- I'm buying your Christmas present.
- With my money?

12:04.005 --> 12:07.789
Yeah, so don't be stingy.

12:07.967 --> 12:15.179
- You never cease to amaze me.
- Don't count it. I trust you.

12:15.349 --> 12:19.299
- Will you really buy me a present?
- I love you.

12:19.478 --> 12:23.310
- Then give me my money.
- Where's your Christmas spirit?

12:23.482 --> 12:27.231
In your pocket.

12:27.403 --> 12:31.104
No ties or cologne, all right?

12:32.617 --> 12:37.741
Remember where you are.
You'd better change that walk.

12:41.584 --> 12:44.620
Are you all right, man?

12:44.795 --> 12:44.879
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

12:44.879 --> 12:47.999
- 1.000.
- I'm in.

12:48.174 --> 12:52.218
See the grand
and kick it a grand.

12:52.386 --> 12:56.170
- Not me.
- I'm out.

12:56.557 --> 13:01.764
I'm gonna have to kick it to 5,000.

13:03.397 --> 13:07.181
Too rich for me.

13:15.284 --> 13:20.491
Charlie ...
are you gonna eat or play cards?

13:22.708 --> 13:27.251
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

13:29.340 --> 13:35.010
- I'll call you.
- With what? You're light.

13:35.179 --> 13:44.100
Gentlemen, say hello to Oyster.
Mother-of-pearl.

13:56.534 --> 14:00.117
Charlie, let me get you a parachute.

14:02.790 --> 14:06.870
Your brother better get here soon
or he'll be an only child.

14:19.807 --> 14:26.177
- Okay, nobody move.
- Is that you? My brother?

14:26.355 --> 14:32.643
- Thank God you're here!
- What the hell is going on here?

14:32.820 --> 14:38.325
- You brought the money, right?
- 300 bucks.

14:38.492 --> 14:43.071
- He owes Mr. Brown 15.000.
- 15.000?

14:43.247 --> 14:46.616
This is no time to be cheap.

14:48.502 --> 14:53.081
- Drop him.
- He's kidding.

14:53.257 --> 14:58.714
- They don't have a sense of humour.
- I'm tired of this shit.

14:58.888 --> 15:01.260
You're the man.

15:04.685 --> 15:10.190
Okay, let's make a deal.
Here's the 300 bucks.

15:10.358 --> 15:14.521
- The rest, you get in a few days.
- I'll pay you, I swear to God.

15:15.821 --> 15:18.906
Okay, reel him in.

15:19.075 --> 15:26.205
You guys are great. I was kidding
about the sense of humour thing.

15:28.292 --> 15:33.962
- I thought they were gonna drop me.
- You said you'd stopped this shit.

15:34.131 --> 15:41.676
- I thought I couldn't lose.
- You say the same thing every time.

15:41.847 --> 15:46.675
- I'm tired of saving your ass.
- I'd have got out of that shit.

15:46.852 --> 15:51.431
If I hadn't saved you,
you'd be a chalk outline right now.

15:51.607 --> 15:55.142
I have changed at a basic level.

15:55.319 --> 16:01.938
I was up there. 51 stories.
Dangling. Imminent death.

16:02.118 --> 16:06.910
Suddenly ... it was like
Buddha consciousness.

16:07.081 --> 16:09.157
I've read about it.

16:09.333 --> 16:14.920
God spoke to me. She said,
'You have got to stop gambling."

16:15.089 --> 16:19.169
- I bet $10 you can't do it.
- Make it $20.

16:19.343 --> 16:26.924
- Where's your sense of humour?
- You've been drinking dog piss.

16:27.101 --> 16:30.137
It's good for you.

16:39.447 --> 16:44.785
Let's see that drunk walk again.

16:52.043 --> 16:57.713
Say hello to Grace Santiago.
She's gonna be working with us.

16:57.882 --> 17:03.089
- Hi, guys. Nice to meet you.
- How are you doing?

17:03.262 --> 17:06.133
Welcome aboard.

17:08.392 --> 17:12.638
- She is smokin'.
- I think I'm in love.

17:33.125 --> 17:37.503
All quiet by the D.

17:49.308 --> 17:52.808
Okay, we've got a Christmas shopper.

17:52.979 --> 17:58.518
A white male. 19.
Dressed all black.

17:58.693 --> 18:01.065
He's interested.

18:02.863 --> 18:08.949
His girlfriend's after him.
She's dragging him away.

18:09.120 --> 18:14.624
- Did you do much decoy?
- Six months in the outer boroughs.

18:14.792 --> 18:18.457
This transfer
was definitely a lucky break.

18:18.629 --> 18:23.421
- They say you guys are the best.
- Modesty prevents me ...

18:23.592 --> 18:27.258
No. it doesn't. We are the best.

18:28.556 --> 18:34.926
His arm's swinging. He looks like
he forgot how to take a whiz.

18:35.104 --> 18:38.438
He got that from me.

18:42.778 --> 18:46.906
- Where are you from?
- The Bronx.

18:47.074 --> 18:52.317
- Are you living by yourself?
- Yeah.

18:52.496 --> 18:58.416
- Keep watching the D.
- We've got something going on.

18:59.503 --> 19:04.130
What have we got here?
Look at those big hands.

19:09.388 --> 19:13.931
- Let's take him home.
- I'm into it.

19:14.101 --> 19:18.265
Hey, honey,
we're gonna take you home.

19:18.439 --> 19:22.389
You want to come home?
You're a fine-looking man.

19:22.568 --> 19:26.352
- Don't fight us.
- Look at that face.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.986
We're gonna love you.

19:29.158 --> 19:35.196
- We're gonna chew you up.
- Come with us.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.501
Shouldn't we break it up?

19:45.091 --> 19:52.885
Hey! That's my man.
Get your hands off my man.

19:53.057 --> 19:59.261
- Do you want to get hurt?
- We didn't know he was your man.

19:59.438 --> 20:02.012
Get out of here!

20:05.611 --> 20:11.946
- I can't trust you for one minute.
- They were huge.

20:13.828 --> 20:15.904
She's beautiful.

20:16.956 --> 20:20.491
Wait right there.

20:23.421 --> 20:26.375
What are you looking at?

20:40.730 --> 20:42.806
Alone at last.

20:42.982 --> 20:47.145
- May I help you?
- We can help each other.

20:47.320 --> 20:51.269
- What do you want, sir?
- I want to ask you a question.

20:54.368 --> 20:58.746
Do you know what it's like
to smell your own flesh burning?

21:05.171 --> 21:10.711
Hand out the cash. bitch.
or I'll light you up.

21:21.062 --> 21:26.898
- I gave you the money.
- I'm not in it for the money.

21:34.408 --> 21:38.655
It's the torch! Call the EMS.

21:51.384 --> 21:54.219
I'll take the street.

22:14.448 --> 22:16.986
Get down!

22:23.124 --> 22:25.365
Sick bastard!

22:25.543 --> 22:27.832
Police!

22:28.004 --> 22:30.839
Get off me.

22:47.773 --> 22:51.522
It's okay.

23:01.245 --> 23:05.159
Johnny, Merry Christmas.
What are you drinking?

23:05.333 --> 23:11.003
The usual. Jack. Straight up.

23:16.844 --> 23:22.087
Give me to of those
and give me to beers.

23:30.232 --> 23:36.686
This is a little hard
so you should drink it with ...

23:38.282 --> 23:41.983
... a beer. Obviously ...

23:42.203 --> 23:45.038
... you've been there before.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.871
That's with me, Johnny.

23:51.545 --> 23:57.714
You took a pretty hard one today.
Too bad he got away.

23:57.885 --> 24:01.634
It was his lucky day.
That won't happen twice.

24:01.806 --> 24:08.971
The EMS people say the clerk
is going to be just fine.

24:09.146 --> 24:14.770
That's good to hear.

24:15.736 --> 24:23.531
This job can be hazardous to your
health if you take it too seriously.

24:23.703 --> 24:28.993
- I don't know no other way.
- Me neither.

24:30.293 --> 24:34.124
It takes a special kind of person
to do this job.

24:34.297 --> 24:38.508
- Someone with dedication.
- Perseverance.

24:38.676 --> 24:41.428
- Stamina.
- Strength.

24:41.595 --> 24:45.676
- Courage.
- Cojones.

24:47.685 --> 24:53.141
- Complete and utter stupidity.
- It's a curse.

24:57.403 --> 25:01.697
- Welcome to the team.
- Thanks.

25:02.616 --> 25:07.907
- How are my to favourite people?
- We were fine.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.156
He's a kidder.

25:10.333 --> 25:17.130
I looked long and hard and I found
you something for your first day.

25:17.298 --> 25:20.797
- The alcohol preserves it.
- Thanks.

25:20.968 --> 25:26.045
He probably stole it
from a girl scout.

25:26.223 --> 25:29.390
Grab us a couple of cervezas.

25:29.560 --> 25:35.396
You don't expect Grace to pay,
and I'm having a cash-flow problem.

25:35.566 --> 25:39.813
You mean you're broke!

25:39.987 --> 25:45.064
You ain't got a dime to your name.
I love the flower.

25:45.242 --> 25:49.240
Great guy ... too bad he's gay.

25:49.413 --> 25:52.948
- How are you doing?
- Good. man.

25:53.125 --> 26:00.504
How does it feel
to be brothers with a white guy?

26:00.675 --> 26:05.383
I told you that story.
I heard a garbage can making noises.

26:05.554 --> 26:07.796
You found him?

26:07.974 --> 26:16.017
Did you feed him? You can't
get rid of them when you feed them.

26:16.190 --> 26:19.226
- Stay black.
- I ain't got no choice.

26:19.402 --> 26:23.779
- The night is young.
- I've got to go.

26:23.948 --> 26:29.404
- The night's a puppy.
- She's leaving.

26:37.628 --> 26:42.835
- I'm in love.
- You ain't got a shot.

26:43.009 --> 26:47.053
- I am deeply in love.
- She is nice.

26:47.221 --> 26:55.051
I'd introduce her to Ma Di
if she was still alive.

26:57.064 --> 27:02.604
You know what they say:
May the best man win.

27:02.778 --> 27:08.733
- I intend to.
- You're dreaming.

27:08.909 --> 27:12.160
You ain't even got a chance.

27:12.330 --> 27:18.202
She didn't even keep the rose
you gave her.

27:19.754 --> 27:21.830
That's fucked up!

27:23.049 --> 27:30.179
- You can buy her a new one.
- I wouldn't do that to you.

27:30.348 --> 27:35.306
It's typical of your insensitivity,
like pissing on that car.

27:35.478 --> 27:40.816
You've always got to be the coolest.
You've always got to be on top.

27:40.983 --> 27:46.108
- I'm just kidding.
- You're always that way.

27:46.280 --> 27:53.161
- Ma Di gave you everything.
- Ma Di treated us the same.

27:53.329 --> 27:57.409
No. She treated me great.

27:57.583 --> 28:02.328
She took me in. she loved me.
but she loved you better.

28:02.505 --> 28:09.124
We got the same thing, Charlie.
It's called sharing.

28:09.303 --> 28:16.634
- I get your coat, you get my shoes.
- I'm always in your shoes.

28:16.811 --> 28:20.227
I'm always Hook's little brother.

28:20.398 --> 28:29.401
- Is this about shoes or Grace?
- My ceiling is always your floor.

28:29.573 --> 28:34.532
- Then move out of the building.
- I like the building.

28:34.704 --> 28:39.662
But you're always first
and I'm always one step behind.

28:39.834 --> 28:45.338
- So now it's my fault?
- Yeah, partially.

28:45.506 --> 28:52.754
- It's you who always fucks it up.
- Now you're calling me a fuckup.

28:52.930 --> 28:59.893
- I didn't say that.
- It's the same fucking thing.

29:00.062 --> 29:04.107
- Are you listening to me?
- I don't need this shit.

29:04.275 --> 29:08.107
- Get your hands off me.
- Or what?

29:08.279 --> 29:12.941
- I'm here, you're there ...
- Make a move. man.

29:13.117 --> 29:16.652
You want to try me?

29:16.829 --> 29:19.534
Wallets, rings and watches.

29:19.707 --> 29:23.491
- Give up your shit.
- Are you deaf?

29:23.669 --> 29:29.458
- I'm talking to you.
- You heard the man.

29:35.348 --> 29:40.722
- Chill out, white boy.
- Now look at the shit we're in.

29:41.646 --> 29:45.145
- Are you gonna blame this on me?
- Definitely.

29:45.316 --> 29:49.812
Who was watching the street?
My back was to the street.

29:49.987 --> 29:53.771
- I'm sick of you.
- Stop pinning everything on me.

29:53.949 --> 29:56.322
Give it up!

29:56.494 --> 29:59.863
- You called me a fuckup.
- I did not!

30:00.039 --> 30:03.704
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

30:03.876 --> 30:07.541
I'm robbing your ass!
Give up your shit!

30:07.713 --> 30:10.833
I'll get you his shoes.

30:12.426 --> 30:14.300
I'll shoot you.

30:14.470 --> 30:16.842
This is a stick-up!

30:17.014 --> 30:20.217
I'll shoot you full of holes.

30:20.393 --> 30:24.093
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:24.271 --> 30:28.649
- You took my Ice Cream records.
- Ice Cube!

30:28.818 --> 30:31.487
They're sick!

30:39.286 --> 30:44.245
- Would you really shoot me?
- Hell. no.

30:44.417 --> 30:47.121
You had that Alabama look.

30:47.294 --> 30:52.040
You're lucky
I didn't have a fire hose.

30:52.216 --> 30:59.263
- You think this girl could be it?
- Yeah. I do.

30:59.432 --> 31:04.343
- Hey, go for it.
- Yeah?

31:04.520 --> 31:09.727
- I'm out of it.
- Are you serious?

31:09.900 --> 31:13.732
I hope she makes you happy.

31:14.780 --> 31:19.822
- Merry Christmas, man.
- Merry Christmas to you, too.

31:34.508 --> 31:40.381
The department says we must have
backup in the Christmas season.

31:40.556 --> 31:43.972
Shut up and stay out of our way.

31:44.143 --> 31:48.604
We didn't ask for this assignment.

31:48.773 --> 31:52.189
We're not here to steal anything.

31:52.360 --> 31:57.946
They're pissed off because we
beat up their buddies on day shift.

31:59.116 --> 32:03.944
Everybody chill.
We're here to help you out.

32:04.121 --> 32:10.623
There's just a Little bit too much
testosterone in here.

32:10.795 --> 32:15.789
Back to your stations.
We've got a schedule to keep.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.458
Dooley ...

32:18.636 --> 32:23.512
- You gonna take in a lot tonight?
- Yeah. three or four million.

32:27.311 --> 32:33.599
- That's money.
- Stop drooling.

32:33.776 --> 32:39.363
Just taking a few mental notes.
Check out that grate.

32:41.909 --> 32:46.488
Look alive.
We've got something up ahead.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.919
Just tunnel workers.

32:54.088 --> 32:59.544
- You're in my place.
- Stop poking me with that thing.

32:59.719 --> 33:04.215
- Shut the fuck up!
- Stop pushing me.

33:09.020 --> 33:13.397
You ain't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him.

33:21.949 --> 33:24.950
Beautiful!

33:27.163 --> 33:30.745
- Is she your wife?
- No. sir.

33:30.916 --> 33:34.961
- Your girlfriend?
- No. sir.

33:35.129 --> 33:40.799
Perhaps your sister?
That would make sense.

33:40.968 --> 33:43.673
A white brother. a black brother ...

33:43.846 --> 33:47.760
... and a Latino sister.

33:49.435 --> 33:55.438
- Officer Grace Santiago, sir.
- You boys are lucky.

33:55.608 --> 33:59.558
How did you get so lucky?

33:59.737 --> 34:05.193
Are they lucky, Officer Santiago?

34:05.368 --> 34:12.414
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Having you as a partner.

34:14.585 --> 34:20.754
- I'll try my best to do my job.
- I'm sure. You're dismissed.

34:22.176 --> 34:26.885
This doesn't concern you,
Officer Santiago.

34:27.681 --> 34:31.216
You boys, you don't listen.

34:32.143 --> 34:36.474
This time you may have your nuts
in a wringer.

34:36.649 --> 34:43.695
The first time my train
was only late, this time it's light.

34:43.864 --> 34:47.399
- Light?
- Sit down.

34:48.953 --> 34:55.750
It seems that in the darkness
somebody made off with $25,000.

34:55.918 --> 35:02.917
- How could that happen?
- Why ask us?

35:03.092 --> 35:06.508
You're a bad gambler.

35:06.679 --> 35:11.839
You're in debt up to your eyeballs.
You're good at losing money.

35:12.018 --> 35:17.890
- How do you think I lost mine?
- Do you think we're behind this?

35:18.065 --> 35:22.811
Did I say that?

35:22.987 --> 35:28.859
All I said was that bad things
seem to happen around you to.

35:29.035 --> 35:34.788
Some money got ... lost.
I think you can help me find it.

35:35.875 --> 35:39.742
- How so?
- You look for it.

35:39.920 --> 35:45.460
If you dig down in that commode
that you call a soul, -

35:45.634 --> 35:49.086
- you'll come up with something.

35:49.263 --> 35:53.592
- I didn't ask to be disturbed.
- You might want to hear this.

36:03.277 --> 36:05.484
Get out of here.

36:13.496 --> 36:15.821
You're dismissed.

36:15.998 --> 36:20.126
- Dismissed?
- Dismissed.

36:24.173 --> 36:29.843
One second you're calling us crooks,
the next we're just dismissed.

36:30.012 --> 36:36.762
The money has been recovered.
A collection agent confessed.

36:41.857 --> 36:46.899
What happened to that money train
model that was on your desk?

36:47.071 --> 36:51.697
Yeah. when I didn't see it.
I was heartbroken.

36:51.867 --> 36:57.028
- It's just gone.
- I bet it took ages to make.

36:57.206 --> 37:02.366
You're a wreck
looking for someplace to happen.

37:02.545 --> 37:07.123
I'll be there ...
and I'll fuck you dead.

37:08.300 --> 37:13.508
- Does he want to fuck us to death?
- When we're dead. he'll fuck us.

37:13.681 --> 37:18.010
Either way, it's a pain in the ass.

37:18.185 --> 37:23.524
Fuck him. Thinking I stole
the money. That's insulting.

37:23.691 --> 37:30.524
- I thought you stole it, too.
- You did?

37:30.698 --> 37:35.905
That's all right, you're family.
That son of a bitch ...

37:37.580 --> 37:40.450
What?

37:40.624 --> 37:43.709
- Look over there.
- It's Wollman Rink.

37:43.878 --> 37:49.583
Last night, those repair guys
came up a ladder into the park.

37:53.721 --> 37:58.597
I see what you're saying.
Stop the train near the rink.

37:58.768 --> 38:02.896
Use the ladder to climb up
and take away the cash.

38:03.064 --> 38:10.276
- We disappear into the park.
- It'll never work.

38:10.446 --> 38:14.907
How much do you think we can get?

38:15.076 --> 38:19.025
Three or four million. at least.

38:21.624 --> 38:28.373
- We could be rich.
- Free. And our people deserve it.

38:28.547 --> 38:33.340
- Say it loud.
- I'm black and I'm proud.

38:34.095 --> 38:38.591
We're talking
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous".

38:38.766 --> 38:43.891
- We could take cruise ships.
- Island to island.

38:44.063 --> 38:49.817
We'd be like boat people, but rich.
We could just buy an island.

38:49.986 --> 38:53.734
Now you're talking.
We could buy Mali.

38:53.906 --> 38:57.405
- Or Bali.
- Tahiti.

38:57.576 --> 39:04.908
We wouldn't have to put up
with any more crap from Patterson.

39:05.084 --> 39:09.082
- We don't deserve that.
- Let the sharks eat him.

39:09.255 --> 39:14.047
- Let's do it.
- Here's what I'm saying ...

39:14.218 --> 39:16.376
Talk to me.

39:16.554 --> 39:23.221
The best possible time
to pull this off is New Year's Eve.

39:23.394 --> 39:29.847
It'll be loaded with currency.
It'll just be fat!

39:30.026 --> 39:36.395
- Where did you learn that word?
- MTV Raps. It's my heritage.

39:36.574 --> 39:39.990
What do you think?

39:42.830 --> 39:46.116
Charlie. come back to earth.

39:46.292 --> 39:50.753
- Calm down.
- What are you talking about?

39:50.921 --> 39:55.548
- We're not going to rob the train.
- Why not?

39:55.718 --> 40:02.467
We're cops ... "Serve, protect,
break a mother's neck."

40:02.641 --> 40:06.935
- We can do this.
- No ...

40:08.522 --> 40:11.227
It would be no problem.

40:11.400 --> 40:15.778
I'm telling you. It's easy.

40:20.701 --> 40:24.913
Put that away before somebody thinks
you got it for Christmas.

40:53.359 --> 40:58.270
- Don't let me interrupt.
- It was too hot inside.

41:00.157 --> 41:03.776
So you're getting down. Salsa.

41:03.953 --> 41:12.707
I love this. I grew up with this.
I'm from the Bronx.

41:14.213 --> 41:17.796
Let's see what you've got.

41:22.138 --> 41:25.257
I'm very surprised.

41:25.808 --> 41:29.224
E Street.

41:29.395 --> 41:33.772
- See that?
- You're teaching me something now.

41:33.941 --> 41:37.275
You've got to learn from somebody.

41:38.738 --> 41:43.530
Watch out now.
I might throw a spin on you.

41:47.621 --> 41:53.245
- It's rough the first time.
- We need to get some practice in.

41:53.419 --> 41:56.420
- We were dancing.
- That was nice.

41:56.589 --> 42:02.425
- Don't just leave me hanging.
- Slow music? No ...

42:02.595 --> 42:07.423
- I don't dance to slow music.
- Don't you like slow music?

42:07.600 --> 42:12.594
How would it look for me
to step up to you like that ...

42:12.772 --> 42:18.312
... and start dancing with you close
and stuff like that?

42:18.486 --> 42:22.020
That could work.

42:27.244 --> 42:31.871
- I've got a confession to make?
- What's that?

42:32.041 --> 42:37.118
This is the first time
I ever danced with a cop.

42:37.296 --> 42:40.463
Me. too.

42:46.389 --> 42:51.430
- I hope that's your gun.
- Yeah, it's poking me, too.

42:51.602 --> 42:54.271
Maybe it's my gun.

42:54.438 --> 43:00.607
- Put your stuff in the back.
- Put your stuff in the back.

43:42.653 --> 43:46.817
I think I should go in.

43:46.991 --> 43:52.330
- We don't want people talking.
- We wouldn't want that.

43:52.496 --> 43:55.912
You know how the precinct is.

43:56.083 --> 43:58.870
You go ahead.

44:00.546 --> 44:03.832
Good night.

44:06.177 --> 44:09.178
Grace ...

44:09.347 --> 44:15.930
- I enjoyed dancing with you.
- I enjoyed it, too.

44:37.833 --> 44:43.124
How goes?

44:43.297 --> 44:46.547
A pina colada?

45:00.481 --> 45:04.431
You've got to get up
you've got to get up in the morning .

45:07.321 --> 45:11.615
I knew I shouldn't have told you
where I hide my keys.

45:11.784 --> 45:15.485
Get up. Time to play.

45:16.789 --> 45:21.332
Say no more, man.
It's hot in here.

45:21.502 --> 45:27.006
- It's like a sauna.
- Don't touch the window.

45:27.174 --> 45:30.294
- Fresh air.
- It's cold outside.

45:30.469 --> 45:34.633
- You've got to get fresh air.
- You're not in the Alps.

45:34.807 --> 45:40.643
- It's good for your lungs.
- Not in New York.

45:43.649 --> 45:50.067
You smell like you haven't been
back to your place to wash.

45:50.239 --> 45:53.690
- I've been out.
- Grace?

45:53.868 --> 45:58.862
I've been out with Grace all night,
and God, I'm feeling good.

46:07.006 --> 46:10.173
All night?

46:11.552 --> 46:15.003
All night, and I feel all right.

46:15.181 --> 46:18.881
Did you try some of your
cheap-ass moves?

46:19.060 --> 46:24.350
- A gentleman never tells.
- What?

46:24.523 --> 46:27.441
A gentleman never tells.

46:27.610 --> 46:35.736
Then you can go ahead and tell me.
How did it go?

46:37.995 --> 46:40.830
We ... I ain't gonna say.

46:42.375 --> 46:46.622
Did you kiss her?

46:50.049 --> 46:52.718
You kissed her.

47:29.880 --> 47:36.085
- Shouldn't you be home in bed?
- Too much energy.

47:37.221 --> 47:42.512
I thought
you worked that out last night.

47:45.312 --> 47:49.061
I've still got
a little something left.

47:53.612 --> 47:57.396
- You want to go at it?
- What? Boxing?

47:57.575 --> 48:02.118
Come on, let's go a few rounds.

48:02.288 --> 48:04.861
Don't hold back.

48:06.584 --> 48:09.787
Are you sure you want to do this?

48:15.134 --> 48:18.005
Sneaky!

48:18.179 --> 48:21.345
Get out of here.

48:22.016 --> 48:25.219
I ain't going nowhere.

48:34.862 --> 48:38.361
Okay ... good.

48:39.283 --> 48:45.238
- You want to talk about last night?
- You mean about you and Charlie?

48:45.414 --> 48:49.957
About you and me,
and the reason you backed off.

48:50.127 --> 48:53.710
Are you gonna box or talk?

48:58.302 --> 49:03.048
- It's Charlie. isn't it?
- Yes!

49:03.224 --> 49:08.680
- The guy's crazy about you.
- This has got to be a first.

49:08.854 --> 49:13.766
You care more about your brother
than you do about yourself.

49:13.984 --> 49:17.436
He is my brother.

49:17.613 --> 49:20.697
Yes. I care about him.

49:20.866 --> 49:23.571
I ain't no saint.

49:23.744 --> 49:27.576
There are times
I could kill the guy.

49:27.748 --> 49:31.413
- I heard he's kind of a fuckup.
- Fuckup?

49:35.881 --> 49:39.464
- I'm sorry.
- I'm okay.

49:39.635 --> 49:43.549
- I was out of line.
- No.

49:43.723 --> 49:50.603
- I have to look after my brother.
- I understand about your brother.

49:50.771 --> 49:55.564
I don't understand what's going on
between you and me.

49:55.735 --> 49:58.570
You and me ...

49:59.030 --> 50:03.526
Yeah.
You and your feelings about me.

50:07.455 --> 50:10.491
Well, I decked you, didn't l?

50:21.969 --> 50:27.592
- I feel the same way about you.
- This could get painful.

50:28.684 --> 50:32.184
Hey, love hurts.

50:34.982 --> 50:37.556
Adios.

50:40.404 --> 50:43.571
Charlie, I want to talk to you.

50:45.451 --> 50:48.368
Come here. man.

50:48.788 --> 50:55.502
- I want to give you this.
- You got me a Christmas present.

51:01.550 --> 51:07.838
- What is this? 15 grand?
- I've been saving for a rainy day.

51:08.015 --> 51:12.973
- It's raining, Charlie.
- I can't take this.

51:13.145 --> 51:20.856
Take it. Handle your affairs.
Go ahead and pay Mr. Brown.

51:21.862 --> 51:26.323
- You're always there for me, Hook.
- You'd be there for me.

51:26.492 --> 51:31.913
No. I wouldn't. You wouldn't
get yourself into a mess like this.

51:36.293 --> 51:40.623
- I'll pay you back every dime.
- I know you will.

51:40.798 --> 51:42.791
I love you, man.

51:42.967 --> 51:47.428
- Handle it.
- I'll do it right now.

51:50.558 --> 51:54.342
I'd better put this shit away.

51:54.520 --> 52:00.558
Meet me tomorrow night.
I want to talk to you.

52:00.735 --> 52:04.567
You got it.

52:06.866 --> 52:11.943
You never cease to amaze me.
My best New Year's ever.

52:12.121 --> 52:16.415
Or something.

52:29.638 --> 52:33.257
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.

52:33.434 --> 52:37.017
Easy does it.

52:48.532 --> 52:52.067
Thank you.

52:55.122 --> 52:56.498
Police!

52:56.666 --> 53:00.366
- Get off of me!
- Settle down.

53:02.254 --> 53:06.383
- Does this look familiar?
- That's my wallet.

53:06.550 --> 53:09.302
I see this all the time.

53:09.470 --> 53:15.140
The best place to keep
your valuables is right here ...

53:23.776 --> 53:28.771
No! Open the door!
Stop the train!

53:49.218 --> 53:52.385
Hi.

53:54.765 --> 53:58.300
Round to.

54:19.874 --> 54:24.417
I know you won't believe this,
but I had Mr. Brown's money.

54:24.587 --> 54:29.213
Some old lady dipped me.

54:29.383 --> 54:33.167
Dip this!

55:51.007 --> 55:54.376
God ...

57:08.751 --> 57:12.334
Charlie, at least let me explain ...

57:12.505 --> 57:18.757
There is nothing to explain.
I knew what was going on.

57:18.928 --> 57:23.305
- You're lying.
- If I'm lying, I'm flying.

57:23.474 --> 57:27.887
I'm happy for you guys.
Why wouldn't I be?

57:28.062 --> 57:32.060
We're brothers, right?

57:36.487 --> 57:39.938
Did you pay Mr. Brown?

57:40.116 --> 57:47.530
Actually, I lost the money,
but what else is new, right?

57:53.629 --> 57:56.085
Damn. Charlie!

58:11.814 --> 58:14.934
Two tokens, please.

58:24.994 --> 58:29.407
What are the chances of the robbers
actually hitting my booth?

58:29.582 --> 58:36.379
The report says it's only one guy
and that he goes for female clerks.

58:36.547 --> 58:40.414
So ... act female.

58:40.593 --> 58:44.591
What? Powder my nose?
Paint my toenails?

58:53.856 --> 58:58.648
Skip said you'd be a little late.

58:58.819 --> 59:03.944
- Are you all right?
- Yeah ... I'm fine.

59:05.451 --> 59:11.821
I was reading that book
you lent me. "The Kabbalian."

59:11.999 --> 59:17.124
It says that the universe
is a mental creation of the All.

59:17.296 --> 59:21.080
- You're drunk.
- No. I'm not drunk.

59:21.258 --> 59:26.763
- Your breath's about 90-proof.
- That's from last night.

59:26.931 --> 59:34.096
I don't want to hear it.
Go home and get some rest.

59:34.271 --> 59:38.435
You've got a lot of nerve
coming in here like this.

01:00:13.269 --> 01:00:18.809
- Let me explain about the money.
- What is it this time? Horses?

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:24.570
No. I was on the train
and this old lady dipped me.

01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:29.531
- Don't lie to me!
- Have I ever lied to you?

01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:33.782
- Maybe about little things.
- A lie is a lie.

01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:40.457
- I want you to believe me.
- I don't. Don't say another word.

01:00:40.629 --> 01:00:44.248
Are you gonna hit me?

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:24.831
- What the hell was that, Darryl?
- Somebody fell on the track.

01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:29.550
Grace, hold your position.
Somebody fell on the tracks.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.928
- Keep your eye on Grace.
- Yeah. I can handle that.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:42.558
- Who's handling dispatch?
- I don't know.

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:52.491
What happened?

01:02:16.058 --> 01:02:20.270
- What the fuck ...
- You remember me?

01:02:20.438 --> 01:02:23.688
Sure you do.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.317
That's my scent you're wearing.

01:02:35.369 --> 01:02:41.739
- Do you want the money?
- No, I don't want the money.

01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:51.302
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

01:02:51.302 --> 01:02:52.713
10-13! Grace is in trouble!

01:02:52.887 --> 01:02:56.386
Freeze!

01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:13.776
Come on!

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:22.994
Police! Move!

01:03:43.104 --> 01:03:46.722
Police! Move!

01:03:57.076 --> 01:04:00.077
Out of the way!

01:04:02.248 --> 01:04:06.032
Move. Police. Out of the way.

01:04:14.844 --> 01:04:17.798
No. Charlie!

01:04:46.834 --> 01:04:48.910
Move! Get out of the way.

01:04:50.796 --> 01:04:53.252
Move! Police!

01:05:40.846 --> 01:05:45.639
You see what happens
when you play with fire?

01:05:46.936 --> 01:05:50.269
You get burned.

01:06:42.616 --> 01:06:45.820
Perfect.

01:06:45.995 --> 01:06:49.446
You created quite a shit storm.

01:06:49.623 --> 01:06:55.876
You could've blown people away
with your reckless shit.

01:06:56.047 --> 01:07:01.670
Now, if you want to look
like a hero, I think I can help.

01:07:01.844 --> 01:07:06.553
Don't worry, kid,
we'll get you out of this one.

01:07:06.724 --> 01:07:09.678
All you've got to do ...

01:07:09.852 --> 01:07:13.553
... is ask for my help.

01:07:16.859 --> 01:07:21.402
It's your badge. It's your life.

01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:24.443
It's your call.

01:07:24.617 --> 01:07:27.783
What do you say?

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.663
No.

01:07:34.794 --> 01:07:37.581
From there.

01:07:37.755 --> 01:07:40.958
Why aren't you laughing?

01:07:41.133 --> 01:07:44.834
Don't you think I'm funny any more?

01:07:45.012 --> 01:07:50.351
- Now, say it.
- You want to hear the words?

01:07:50.518 --> 01:07:54.729
I want to hear the words.

01:07:56.315 --> 01:08:03.148
- Kiss my fucking ass.
- You kiss it. You're fired!

01:08:03.322 --> 01:08:08.827
Get up, Charlie.
We can work this out.

01:08:08.994 --> 01:08:15.364
- Not with this piece of shit.
- Your brother ain't a cop no more.

01:08:15.543 --> 01:08:20.169
- Let me talk to him.
- What do you want to help him for?

01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:24.419
Everybody knows
your brother is a fuckup.

01:08:24.593 --> 01:08:28.508
- A what?
- A fuckup.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.259
I don't have to take this shit.
I'll bust your ass!

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:38.477
Go ahead. take a bite of me.
You'll never get rid of the taste.

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:42.978
- You son of a bitch!
- That's it! You're busted!

01:08:43.154 --> 01:08:46.319
I don't have to take this shit!

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:52.992
When your friend calms down,
tell him his badge belongs to me.

01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:59.783
I'll send a uniformed officer around
to pick up my hardware.

01:08:59.962 --> 01:09:05.965
You don't have to send nobody.
You can come and get it yourself.

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:09.634
This is between you and me,
not you and him.

01:09:09.805 --> 01:09:15.225
Who does he think he is? Fuck him!
He's gonna regret this day.

01:09:15.394 --> 01:09:19.059
No, fuck you, Charlie.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.939
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you.

01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:29.651
I didn't ask you to step in ...
but it'll work out, don't worry.

01:09:29.825 --> 01:09:35.531
No, it's not gonna work out.
Not this time.

01:09:35.706 --> 01:09:39.490
- Come back. bro.
- We're not brothers.

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:42.872
We have nothing in common.

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:47.424
I've always been carrying you
on my back.

01:09:47.593 --> 01:09:55.138
Am I gonna give up my career
for you? No! Get out of my life!

01:10:12.034 --> 01:10:18.618
Frank, do you happen to know
why blind people don't skydive?

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.288
No, why?

01:10:22.461 --> 01:10:25.546
It scares their dogs.

01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:35.505
It scares their ...
You're a tough crowd, Frank.

01:10:35.683 --> 01:10:38.518
Another Jagermeister.

01:10:38.686 --> 01:10:42.980
You've had enough, Charlie.
You're cut off.

01:10:45.526 --> 01:10:48.895
What's your problem?

01:10:49.071 --> 01:10:53.947
You're interfering with me
at the embryo stage of a bender.

01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:58.744
Other than that
I've got nothing to worry about.

01:10:58.914 --> 01:11:04.869
I've got no job, no brother,
no girlfriend, no future ...

01:11:05.046 --> 01:11:11.298
I've got nothing to lose. For the
first time in my life ... I'm free.

01:11:11.469 --> 01:11:16.925
- "God bless us all, Tiny Tim."
- You're over the top, Charlie.

01:11:17.099 --> 01:11:21.179
Don't do anything stupid.

01:11:21.854 --> 01:11:24.689
Where's the fun in that?

01:11:24.899 --> 01:11:29.027
I just remembered,
I have to urinate.

01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:31.946
I'll pick this up later.

01:11:55.054 --> 01:11:57.806
I don't have the money.

01:11:57.973 --> 01:12:04.261
Go ahead and kill me.
Right now it'd be a relief.

01:12:04.438 --> 01:12:08.353
I hate to hear
that kind of fatalism, I really do.

01:12:08.526 --> 01:12:15.822
We can't keep on doing this because
it doesn't have any effect on you.

01:12:15.991 --> 01:12:20.653
What I do in a case like yours,
and I'm being forced here ...

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:23.914
... is threaten someone you love.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:27.368
A wife. A child.

01:12:27.545 --> 01:12:32.041
- A brother ...
- Son of a bitch.

01:12:35.511 --> 01:12:39.046
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

01:12:46.897 --> 01:12:52.236
January 1st ...
or your nigger brother's dead.

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:37.664
- What are you doing here, Frank?
- I want to talk about Charlie.

01:14:37.842 --> 01:14:41.127
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:15:25.389 --> 01:15:29.138
Gentlemen, keep the fires hot!

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:34.055
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Mr. Brown.

01:15:34.231 --> 01:15:36.901
Get out of here.

01:15:37.068 --> 01:15:39.737
You missed.

01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:45.648
I hate that.

01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:57.165
- You've got a disgruntled employee.
- Kick his fucking ...

01:15:58.672 --> 01:16:02.753
You can't come in here like that.

01:16:02.927 --> 01:16:07.339
Stop fucking around.

01:16:07.515 --> 01:16:13.553
Bring him over here. I'll kill him.
You got big balls? I'll cut 'em off.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.192
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.693
You bunch of pussies!

01:16:25.157 --> 01:16:31.694
- We're not getting along.
- You want some of me?

01:16:48.973 --> 01:16:52.009
What are you, stupid?

01:16:55.062 --> 01:16:57.849
You'll get your money.

01:16:58.023 --> 01:17:06.316
But if anything happens
to my brother ... You understand me?

01:17:12.997 --> 01:17:16.413
Oh yeah ...
Who are you calling a nigger?

01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:04.373
- Happy New Year.
- Hi. John.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.382
- Happy New Year.
- Johnny!

01:18:12.014 --> 01:18:16.226
Charlie came by earlier
and left it for you.

01:18:18.187 --> 01:18:22.351
- It took you long enough.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

01:18:23.442 --> 01:18:27.855
What is this dress you've got on?
Turn around.

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:32.324
- This old rag?
- Just one you had in the closet?

01:18:32.493 --> 01:18:35.660
- You got a permit for this dress?
- You're happy.

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:40.657
I did one last favour for Charlie.
so I'm feeling like a free man.

01:18:40.835 --> 01:18:42.993
"The Islands Call."

01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:48.165
- Charlie sent it over.
- Open it.

01:18:56.225 --> 01:19:00.353
- Damn it. He's gonna do it.
- Do what?

01:19:00.521 --> 01:19:03.392
Rob the money train.

01:19:03.566 --> 01:19:07.610
- Say again?
- He's gonna rob the money train.

01:19:07.778 --> 01:19:13.614
- He wants me in with him.
- Patterson will kill him.

01:19:13.784 --> 01:19:17.996
- Aren't you gonna do anything?
- Why should l?

01:19:18.164 --> 01:19:23.620
Charlie is going down ... and you
are the only family that he's got.

01:20:38.077 --> 01:20:40.069
Open up.

01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:50.538
Jesus Christ!

01:21:33.257 --> 01:21:35.250
Shoot!

01:21:49.857 --> 01:21:57.484
- The money train has been stolen!
- I've got to call Patterson.

01:22:18.052 --> 01:22:20.673
Out of the way!

01:22:27.395 --> 01:22:30.230
Move!

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:03.471
Attention, everyone!

01:23:03.639 --> 01:23:07.388
The situation here
will be resolved immediately.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:13.680
These perpetrators are fools
and their luck just ran out.

01:23:13.858 --> 01:23:18.567
Let's get them. Remember:
The money train has not been stolen.

01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:25.405
It is still in our tunnel.
and soon it will be in our hands.

01:24:17.588 --> 01:24:20.542
Shit!

01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:58.208
You scared the shit out of me. man.

01:24:58.379 --> 01:25:02.626
- How did you find me?
- You told me the plan, remember?

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.169
- Only Plan A. Now we're on B.
- What?

01:25:06.345 --> 01:25:10.295
- We'll figure it out.
- This is Plan B:

01:25:10.474 --> 01:25:16.513
- We leave without the money.
- I ain't down with that.

01:25:16.689 --> 01:25:23.985
- Then we've got a serious problem.
- Yeah, I guess we do.

01:25:26.949 --> 01:25:29.985
If you turn me in, you get a medal.

01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:35.238
- Get us the hell out of here.
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:43.455
When this is over.
I'll knock you out.

01:25:46.927 --> 01:25:52.052
The money train is reported
going south on the A-line.

01:25:58.230 --> 01:26:05.443
This is Donald Patterson.
Shut down the train and surrender.

01:26:05.613 --> 01:26:07.736
Don't do that.

01:26:07.907 --> 01:26:15.119
Donald, the robbery's going great
and you'll still get your cut.

01:26:15.289 --> 01:26:19.073
You sons of bitches.
I don't know who you are, -

01:26:19.251 --> 01:26:25.337
- but when I get my hands on you
I'll rip your hearts out.

01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:29.126
I don't appreciate
that tone of voice.

01:26:31.222 --> 01:26:33.843
Don't even look at me.

01:26:36.227 --> 01:26:43.225
When Patterson trips the brakes,
our joyride is gonna be over.

01:26:43.401 --> 01:26:47.445
We have to bleed the brakes.

01:26:47.613 --> 01:26:54.114
- Great, then they can't stop us.
- Then we can't stop, either.

01:26:54.286 --> 01:27:00.407
It's bleed the brakes or end up
the butt brothers in D-block.

01:27:01.252 --> 01:27:04.418
Bleed the brakes.

01:27:07.508 --> 01:27:11.422
- Get me 42nd Street.
- Stand by for Chief Patterson.

01:27:11.595 --> 01:27:15.261
The money train is coming your way.
Shut her down.

01:27:15.433 --> 01:27:19.300
Trip her brakes.
Reach in and tear her guts out.

01:27:30.156 --> 01:27:35.067
Come on, baby. It's got to work.

01:27:38.622 --> 01:27:42.406
Yes!

01:27:44.086 --> 01:27:50.456
It didn't stop, sir.
I don't think it has any brakes.

01:27:57.433 --> 01:28:01.181
I want the shooters
on the Grand Street platform.

01:28:01.353 --> 01:28:07.890
- Aim at the motorman's cabin.
- Use a construction barricade.

01:28:08.069 --> 01:28:12.565
Good point.
I want a barricade in place now!

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:17.236
That thing's reinforced steel.
They'll be killed.

01:28:21.582 --> 01:28:26.956
Money train, this is Patterson.
I have an information update.

01:28:27.129 --> 01:28:31.875
At the Grand Street Station we have
a reinforced steel barricade.

01:28:32.051 --> 01:28:36.262
Shut it down
and turn yourself in ...

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.553
... or die!

01:28:39.058 --> 01:28:42.723
He's bluffing, right?

01:28:56.242 --> 01:28:59.907
You. over there.
You to. come with me.

01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:08.584
What are we gonna do?
We can't stop this thing.

01:29:08.754 --> 01:29:13.001
Go faster. Faster!

01:29:15.886 --> 01:29:19.386
Come on!

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.723
Charlie ... he wasn't bluffing!

01:29:43.664 --> 01:29:46.202
Ready. Easy, now.

01:29:52.423 --> 01:29:55.424
Wait for my command.

01:29:57.511 --> 01:30:00.263
Fire!

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.477
You're not gonna believe this.
The train broke the barricade.

01:31:13.421 --> 01:31:17.501
- I'll have to start clearing track.
- Wait a minute.

01:31:17.675 --> 01:31:21.459
- What's the nearest train?
- The 12:20. I'll sidetrack her.

01:31:21.637 --> 01:31:28.055
What? And give them a clear track?
Raise me the motorman.

01:31:28.227 --> 01:31:33.185
- Command to 12:20.
- 12:20 to Command.

01:31:33.357 --> 01:31:37.569
This is Donald Patterson.
Bypass all stops.

01:31:37.737 --> 01:31:41.402
- What's going on?
- Shut up and do your job!

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:55.329
Maybe we're on the wrong train.
It didn't stop.

01:32:03.137 --> 01:32:08.807
Two trains are on the same track.
there could be a derailment.

01:32:08.976 --> 01:32:16.189
There'll be no derailment.
They'll shut the money train down.

01:32:16.358 --> 01:32:21.601
If the money train can't stop,
people could die.

01:32:21.781 --> 01:32:24.485
That's what we live with.

01:32:35.002 --> 01:32:39.711
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- I'm getting paid.

01:32:39.882 --> 01:32:43.583
- The money stays.
- Feel that.

01:32:43.761 --> 01:32:49.182
That's our freedom.
I'm not leaving here empty handed.

01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:55.684
"Charlie the loser."
I've heard that my whole life.

01:32:55.856 --> 01:33:02.855
- Thieves aren't winners.
- Save the lecture for Tahiti.

01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:05.521
No, forget it.

01:33:07.493 --> 01:33:13.080
Don't fuck with my fantasy!
lf you want out, get out of my face!

01:33:13.249 --> 01:33:19.667
- I won't let you ruin your life.
- How are you gonna save me?

01:33:27.596 --> 01:33:30.432
Get that foot off that bag!

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.068
Don't try me. Are you trying me?

01:33:44.613 --> 01:33:51.446
- Just let it go.
- I'm taking the money, man.

01:34:25.321 --> 01:34:26.945
Damn!

01:34:34.497 --> 01:34:37.118
Give me your hand.

01:34:43.464 --> 01:34:46.963
Grab onto my hand!

01:34:47.134 --> 01:34:51.084
- I've got you, man.
- Charlie ...

01:34:52.348 --> 01:34:55.764
Come on. John.

01:35:19.708 --> 01:35:23.291
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:24.547 --> 01:35:30.003
- Are we straight?
- Yeah, we're straight.

01:35:41.939 --> 01:35:47.016
- Let's shut this puppy down.
- That's easier said than done.

01:35:47.194 --> 01:35:51.737
You and me. man.
What can stop us?

01:35:59.081 --> 01:36:02.782
My God!

01:36:27.735 --> 01:36:30.771
Patterson didn't clear the tracks.

01:36:30.946 --> 01:36:37.779
- We're gonna derail them.
- These people are gonna die.

01:36:37.953 --> 01:36:42.615
- Do something.
- The bitch won't move.

01:36:46.128 --> 01:36:48.204
Maximum speed.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:55.094
The other train's too fast!
We're fucking dead! You hear me?

01:36:59.433 --> 01:37:04.807
All emergency units,
head to Fort Hamilton Station.

01:37:10.569 --> 01:37:17.153
- Throw the damn thing in reverse.
- The train will do a somersault.

01:37:17.326 --> 01:37:22.486
- But we live, right?
- No, they live. We die.

01:37:23.666 --> 01:37:30.333
So be it. We hit the reverse switch
and say goodbye.

01:37:30.506 --> 01:37:34.717
- We don't have time for this.
- Just jump, man.

01:37:34.885 --> 01:37:38.135
I can't jump! We're in a tunnel!

01:37:38.305 --> 01:37:42.220
This is my responsibility.
It's my fuckup!

01:37:42.393 --> 01:37:44.682
We're in this together.

01:37:59.243 --> 01:38:02.197
What are you doing?

01:38:02.371 --> 01:38:06.285
Are you gonna pole vault
out of here?

01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:14.292
Autopilot. When this hits,
it'll throw her into reverse.

01:38:25.186 --> 01:38:29.978
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know.

01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.770
- Where's my train?
- It's to minutes out.

01:38:38.949 --> 01:38:41.191
Good!

01:38:49.126 --> 01:38:52.578
When we get out of this,
remind me ...

01:38:55.216 --> 01:38:58.834
Don't let go.

01:39:05.601 --> 01:39:09.599
Get to the front.

01:40:31.562 --> 01:40:36.901
- Are they dead?
- There's nobody here.

01:40:37.068 --> 01:40:40.436
They're here.

01:40:43.365 --> 01:40:47.410
They're here. You fuck with my train
and I'll find you.

01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:53.826
I'll find you.

01:40:55.961 --> 01:41:00.754
- Shit! Is that Patterson?
- Get out of my way.

01:41:01.884 --> 01:41:05.834
- What are we gonna do?
- I'll find you.

01:41:06.013 --> 01:41:09.714
Be cool.

01:41:11.727 --> 01:41:16.270
- We came as fast as we could.
- What a mess.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.734
- If we can help ...
- All you've got to do is ask.

01:41:20.903 --> 01:41:28.614
- What are you doing here?
- We just want to help.

01:41:28.786 --> 01:41:34.622
How's your cock working now that
you ain't got a badge any more?

01:41:34.792 --> 01:41:39.205
This is what I think of you,
you fuckup ...

01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:41.953
You spit in my face?

01:41:42.133 --> 01:41:45.584
You aren't gonna hit him ...
I'm gonna hit him!

01:41:45.761 --> 01:41:48.431
We'll both hit him.

01:41:56.730 --> 01:42:00.016
Arrest those to for assault.

01:42:02.278 --> 01:42:08.150
No, Patterson, I'm arresting you.
You endangered people's lives.

01:42:09.994 --> 01:42:13.244
Did you see that?

01:42:15.416 --> 01:42:18.583
Arrest his ass! He tried to kill us!

01:42:18.753 --> 01:42:23.747
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?

01:42:23.924 --> 01:42:28.421
Officer Santiago.

01:42:55.164 --> 01:42:59.411
- We did it!
- We did it!

01:43:01.003 --> 01:43:04.170
Happy New Year.

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.210
I love you, man.

01:43:07.384 --> 01:43:12.592
- What is that?
- I've put on some weight.

01:43:12.765 --> 01:43:19.562
- What are you, six months pregnant?
- You're gonna overreact on this.

01:43:21.774 --> 01:43:25.641
- I knew you'd overreact.
- Overreact?

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:29.319
We risked our lives. man.

01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:32.989
It's New Year's.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:40.242
- I saved your life.
- It's a miracle we're alive.
