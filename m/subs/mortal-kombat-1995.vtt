WEBVTT

01:49.007 --> 01:52.260
Your brother's soul is mine.

01:52.343 --> 01:53.594
Liu!

01:54.636 --> 01:57.389
You will be next.

02:07.607 --> 02:09.024
Chan.

02:29.209 --> 02:33.003
"Liu Kang - Brother Dead.
Return home. Grandfather"

02:41.803 --> 02:42.845
Let's go.

02:43.763 --> 02:45.972
ls the perimeter secured?

02:46.056 --> 02:48.683
- Yes!
- Better be, l want Kano.

02:48.767 --> 02:52.978
- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person. You talk to her.

03:12.579 --> 03:14.206
Good boy.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.750
She's here.

03:18.584 --> 03:20.503
Right on time.

03:23.130 --> 03:25.882
l love punctuality in a woman...

03:26.925 --> 03:28.802
don't you...

03:28.885 --> 03:30.678
Mr. Shang Tsung?

03:34.640 --> 03:36.976
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?

03:37.934 --> 03:39.978
You killed her partner, didn't you?

03:41.354 --> 03:43.398
She'll follow you into hell.

03:43.481 --> 03:45.691
Just make sure she's on that boat.

03:45.774 --> 03:49.361
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.

03:53.197 --> 03:55.616
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.911
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.

03:58.995 --> 04:02.622
lf you so much as touch her, Kano...

04:04.708 --> 04:06.501
you'll need a seeing eye dog.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.700
Where's Kano?

04:46.577 --> 04:48.496
Where is he?

05:21.525 --> 05:22.650
Let's dance.

05:55.345 --> 05:57.431
This is where you fall down.

06:01.434 --> 06:05.062
Where do you get these guys?

06:05.146 --> 06:07.772
The press says l don't know
how to do this stuff?

06:07.856 --> 06:11.818
- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.

06:11.901 --> 06:13.570
- What do you mean?
- l won't.

06:13.653 --> 06:16.488
- lt's the last shot! Where you going?
- To my trailer.

06:16.572 --> 06:19.533
Then l'll shoot myself for being
in your movie.

06:19.616 --> 06:22.243
Kill me.
l'll be back directing traffic.

06:22.326 --> 06:25.038
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!

06:25.121 --> 06:26.998
l love you. l need you.

06:27.081 --> 06:29.207
Excuse me,

06:29.249 --> 06:32.044
there's someone who wants
to speak to you.

06:32.127 --> 06:34.588
- Who is it?
- l don't really know.

06:34.671 --> 06:38.716
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. l...

06:38.799 --> 06:42.053
- lt had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.

06:42.094 --> 06:43.721
You want me to find out?

06:47.807 --> 06:49.392
Oh, great.

06:49.434 --> 06:51.394
Mister, you're in my chair.

06:51.436 --> 06:53.562
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"

06:55.939 --> 06:57.733
Hi, Johnny.

06:58.942 --> 07:00.735
Master Boyd.

07:00.818 --> 07:04.614
The press is still giving you
a hard time.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.531
Yeah, they think l'm a fake.

07:06.615 --> 07:10.410
You're one of the best
martial artists in the world...

07:10.494 --> 07:13.288
and l can help you prove it.

07:13.372 --> 07:14.455
Prove it? How?

07:14.538 --> 07:16.248
A tournament.

07:16.332 --> 07:17.750
The tournament.

07:17.833 --> 07:21.003
lt's held once a generation.

07:22.295 --> 07:24.589
The world's best fighters
are invited.

07:24.672 --> 07:28.218
You win the tournament,
you win their respect.

07:28.301 --> 07:32.096
They'll tell the entire world
you're the real goods.

07:32.179 --> 07:34.598
- So how do l...?
- There's a boat.

07:34.682 --> 07:36.641
Leaves pier forty...

07:36.683 --> 07:38.601
Hong Kong, tomorrow.

07:38.643 --> 07:40.436
Be on it.

07:56.492 --> 07:58.827
"The Temple of Light, China"

08:36.568 --> 08:37.986
Liu.

08:47.578 --> 08:49.580
ls this the place?

08:49.621 --> 08:51.122
Yes.

08:51.205 --> 08:53.916
This is where we found his body.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.710
What happened?

08:55.793 --> 08:58.254
After you left for America...

08:58.338 --> 09:00.505
he followed in your footsteps.

09:00.589 --> 09:02.382
Preparing for the tournament.

09:02.424 --> 09:06.594
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough
to fill my head with that nonsense?

09:06.677 --> 09:09.263
To save the world is not nonsense.

09:09.347 --> 09:13.683
Men fighting in a simple contest
don't decide these things.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.435
How can a wise man believe this?

09:15.518 --> 09:17.437
We all believe in it...

09:17.520 --> 09:19.397
including your brother.

09:35.495 --> 09:38.246
Liu Kang has been given the dream.

09:38.288 --> 09:40.207
He is the Chosen One.

09:40.290 --> 09:45.086
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.005
Why have you come back?

09:48.089 --> 09:51.549
l want to represent the Order of Light
at the Tournament.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.259
For what reason?

09:53.301 --> 09:56.096
My brother's killer will be there.

09:56.179 --> 09:59.306
That cannot be your only reason
for going...

09:59.390 --> 10:01.600
or you will fail.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.269
Oh yes, l forgot.

10:04.311 --> 10:07.355
We're fighting for the fate
of the world.

10:07.438 --> 10:09.607
That's why you left the temple...

10:09.691 --> 10:12.485
and ran away, isn't it?

10:21.742 --> 10:26.122
The Great Tournament
was too much responsibility.

10:26.163 --> 10:27.665
But vengeance...

10:29.916 --> 10:32.085
that's so much simpler.

10:32.168 --> 10:34.087
Lord Rayden.

10:37.506 --> 10:40.092
You're still running away
from your destiny.

10:44.679 --> 10:46.264
Rayden?

10:47.098 --> 10:48.641
Grandfather, get up.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.518
This isn't your God of Thunder.

10:51.601 --> 10:54.604
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.774
American life has enfeebled his mind.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.692
Too much television.

10:59.775 --> 11:02.278
So, you're going to
win the tournament?

11:02.361 --> 11:04.780
- Yes, l am.
- Show me how.

11:08.366 --> 11:10.827
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid...

11:10.869 --> 11:12.579
of a simple beggar?

11:26.424 --> 11:28.342
lf you are Rayden...

11:29.426 --> 11:31.762
why did you let Chan die?

11:31.845 --> 11:35.306
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?

11:36.849 --> 11:38.934
l've had enough of this.

11:40.603 --> 11:43.521
l'll find my brother's killer
at the tournament.

11:43.563 --> 11:46.858
With or without your consent.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.117
He isn't ready, my Lord...

11:58.201 --> 12:00.161
and we lost so much time.

12:00.244 --> 12:02.288
l know.

12:02.372 --> 12:04.165
But there is no one else.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.930
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"

12:33.524 --> 12:35.274
Ah, give me a break.

12:39.529 --> 12:41.739
"Johnny Cage Fake!"

12:42.823 --> 12:44.449
- Sure.

12:45.867 --> 12:47.619
Aren't you Art Lean?

12:47.703 --> 12:50.705
l saw you fight in London,
you're great.

12:50.788 --> 12:55.584
Thanks. l saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.

12:55.668 --> 12:57.836
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.134
Pal, when the ship comes in...

13:05.217 --> 13:07.553
could you put these on board?

13:07.636 --> 13:09.638
You want me to carry your luggage?

13:09.722 --> 13:13.266
l pay money. You carry bags.

13:13.349 --> 13:16.394
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.

13:16.477 --> 13:17.603
l got it.

13:17.687 --> 13:19.105
Good.

13:32.867 --> 13:36.036
Thank God l didn't ask him
to park the car.

13:40.165 --> 13:43.417
Nothing says that creep at the club
wasn't lying.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.919
Kano could be 1000 miles
from here by now.

13:50.923 --> 13:52.216
What is that?

14:02.225 --> 14:04.353
You must be kidding me.

14:22.576 --> 14:24.036
Wait.

14:24.078 --> 14:26.038
That's it, Blade...

14:26.747 --> 14:28.539
come to Papa.

14:37.464 --> 14:39.508
Sonya, don't get on that thing.

14:39.591 --> 14:41.218
Hey, Sonya!

15:03.779 --> 15:05.405
Hey, you.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.783
Alright, tough guy, you want to get...

15:08.866 --> 15:09.951
tough?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.577
No. Do you?

15:11.661 --> 15:15.080
l'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?

15:15.122 --> 15:17.082
Where's Kano?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.084
l don't know who you're talking about.

15:21.043 --> 15:22.962
But l can help you find him.

15:23.045 --> 15:24.964
Out of my way.

15:27.299 --> 15:29.718
Just another starstruck fan, huh?

15:53.113 --> 15:55.365
l'm honored to finally meet you.

15:56.241 --> 15:58.826
Shang Tsung at your service.

16:00.494 --> 16:03.497
l'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.

16:03.581 --> 16:06.124
l'm impressed.

16:06.207 --> 16:09.377
But it is my boat,
and if you'd like a tour...

16:09.461 --> 16:12.254
l'd love to give it to you myself.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.132
Be nice to the lady.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.967
She's doing her job.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.136
When l want back-up
l'll radio for it.

16:27.309 --> 16:29.269
Got that radio handy?

16:34.523 --> 16:36.776
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.

16:37.860 --> 16:40.196
The deadliest of enemies...

16:40.279 --> 16:42.364
but slaves under my power.

16:44.866 --> 16:45.700
Move aside.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.686
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.

17:17.728 --> 17:21.021
How good of you to grace us
with your...

17:21.731 --> 17:22.898
presence.

17:25.151 --> 17:27.861
Your sideshow freaks
attacked my fighters.

17:27.903 --> 17:31.699
That is expressly forbidden
before the tournament...

17:31.740 --> 17:33.742
as your emperor well knows.

17:33.825 --> 17:36.327
My sincere apologies.

17:36.411 --> 17:38.496
lt won't happen again,
l promise you.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.915
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.

17:42.249 --> 17:44.209
Until we reach the island...

17:44.251 --> 17:46.128
where you have no dominion.

17:46.211 --> 17:48.796
My dominions are well known to me,
sorcerer.

17:48.879 --> 17:51.340
- Thank you.
- What tournament?

17:53.259 --> 17:55.344
You've been chosen, Sonya.

17:56.761 --> 17:59.514
Much to my delight.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.021
You really are Rayden.

18:07.646 --> 18:09.231
Come with me.

18:14.444 --> 18:18.281
1 guy with things coming
out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff...

18:18.364 --> 18:21.783
and 1 man who seems to be made
out of electricity.

18:21.867 --> 18:25.287
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?

18:25.370 --> 18:27.371
Let's think this through.

18:27.455 --> 18:29.582
There is a rational explanation.

18:29.665 --> 18:34.294
He's Rayden, God of Lightening
and Protector of the Realm of Earth.

18:34.377 --> 18:36.671
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.

18:36.755 --> 18:38.173
Listen.

18:39.716 --> 18:41.717
What you're about to face is...

18:41.800 --> 18:43.719
vastly more important than...

18:43.802 --> 18:46.055
your ego...

18:46.138 --> 18:47.765
your enemy...

18:47.806 --> 18:51.476
or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked...

18:51.559 --> 18:53.937
on a sacred mission.

18:54.020 --> 18:57.564
You have been chosen to defend
the Realm of Earth...

18:57.648 --> 19:00.567
in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.

19:00.651 --> 19:02.277
Defend it from who?

19:03.778 --> 19:07.114
Your world is but
one of many realms.

19:07.198 --> 19:10.785
One of them is a forsaken land
called Outworld...

19:10.826 --> 19:14.496
ruled by an immortal
who has crowned himself emperor.

19:14.579 --> 19:18.041
Now he seeks a new world
to conquer and enslave.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.000
Now, wait a second.

19:20.084 --> 19:22.419
lf this guy is so powerful...

19:22.503 --> 19:24.338
why doesn't he invade us?

19:24.421 --> 19:26.547
To enter the Realm of Earth

19:26.631 --> 19:29.300
the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung...

19:29.342 --> 19:33.470
and his warriors must win 10 straight
victories in Mortal Kombat.

19:35.305 --> 19:37.474
They have won nine.

19:37.557 --> 19:40.560
This will be the tenth.

19:40.644 --> 19:44.689
A handful of people on a leaky boat
are going to save the world?

19:45.523 --> 19:47.108
Exactly.

19:48.192 --> 19:50.986
The essence of Mortal Kombat...

19:53.405 --> 19:55.490
is not about death...

19:56.282 --> 19:58.200
but life.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.495
Mortal men and women...

20:01.579 --> 20:03.454
defending your own world.

20:03.538 --> 20:05.498
Why are you telling me this?

20:05.582 --> 20:07.500
What about the others?

20:07.584 --> 20:09.836
They are all great fighters...

20:11.128 --> 20:13.880
but l have looked
into their souls...

20:15.173 --> 20:17.551
and yours.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.261
One of you will decide
the outcome of the tournament.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.515
The fate...

20:24.599 --> 20:27.183
of billions will depend upon you.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.688
Sorry.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.897
What about Shang Tsung?

20:38.444 --> 20:41.738
Oh, still concerned
only with vengeance?

20:41.779 --> 20:44.782
lf you challenge Shang Tsung now...

20:44.824 --> 20:47.160
you'll lose your life and your soul.

20:47.243 --> 20:49.411
He'll pay for my brother's death.

20:51.121 --> 20:53.040
You're not ready.

20:56.042 --> 20:57.084
Look.

20:58.628 --> 21:00.379
lt has begun.

21:17.353 --> 21:19.395
lt has begun.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.712
Black Hawk to Cardinal.

21:48.796 --> 21:52.549
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
ls anybody monitoring?

21:55.094 --> 21:58.346
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?

21:58.429 --> 22:01.641
While you're at it,
call my agent.

22:01.683 --> 22:03.976
Do l look like your secretary?

22:31.584 --> 22:32.834
What are you doing?

22:32.917 --> 22:36.129
The electrical disturbance
blew out the transistors.

22:36.212 --> 22:38.172
Your radio equipment's fine.

22:38.214 --> 22:40.173
Look at your compass.

22:46.847 --> 22:49.015
Where the hell are we?

22:49.056 --> 22:52.059
- Do l look like your travel agent?
- Fine.

22:52.143 --> 22:53.978
Okay...

22:54.061 --> 22:55.645
l give up.

22:56.313 --> 22:57.606
What's going on?

22:57.689 --> 22:59.399
l don't know.

23:00.567 --> 23:03.027
But what if all the legends
were true?

23:07.239 --> 23:08.824
What legends?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.096
Do you need help with those?

23:44.104 --> 23:46.023
Ah, no more steps.

23:51.152 --> 23:54.572
Great! Can't wait
to see the bathrooms.

24:20.636 --> 24:21.762
You know?

24:22.638 --> 24:24.847
When a woman looks at you like that...

24:24.931 --> 24:26.933
it usually means something.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.777
Princess Kitana.

24:39.819 --> 24:42.613
She's our most dangerous adversary.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.242
Watch her carefully, Reptile.

24:46.325 --> 24:49.619
Keep her away from these humans.

26:09.104 --> 26:10.481
Welcome.

26:10.564 --> 26:13.067
You're here to compete in...

26:13.150 --> 26:14.693
Mortal Kombat.

26:14.777 --> 26:18.738
Tomorrow morning the great
combat begins.

26:18.780 --> 26:21.366
Some will have the distinct honor...

26:21.449 --> 26:23.910
and pleasure...

26:23.952 --> 26:27.412
to face Prince Goro...

26:28.330 --> 26:29.957
our reigning champion.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.834
You are witnesses to a great
turning point in the history...

26:33.918 --> 26:35.836
of your planet.

26:37.213 --> 26:39.130
Treasure these moments...

26:40.966 --> 26:42.926
as if they were your last.

26:44.386 --> 26:47.137
Now, for a taste of things to come...

28:03.537 --> 28:06.332
Flawless victory.

28:13.129 --> 28:17.966
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.

28:18.050 --> 28:19.843
Yeah, right.

28:19.885 --> 28:20.886
Liu.

28:23.180 --> 28:25.264
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.

28:25.348 --> 28:29.310
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?

28:29.352 --> 28:33.188
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.

28:34.356 --> 28:36.983
You know, you've got to admire her.

28:37.067 --> 28:40.277
When she sets her mind on something...

28:40.361 --> 28:42.613
lt's not her mind you're admiring.

28:44.907 --> 28:46.074
True.

29:22.231 --> 29:26.192
How many times must l tell you?
l don't need your help.

29:26.276 --> 29:28.194
l can take care of myself.

29:28.278 --> 29:31.321
We can't help it.
lt's a guy thing.

29:31.405 --> 29:34.283
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.

29:34.366 --> 29:37.452
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.

29:38.452 --> 29:40.246
Let's forget about Shang.

29:40.329 --> 29:42.123
Forget about him?

29:42.206 --> 29:45.709
l want to get to the bottom of this.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.752
Are you out of your mind?

30:03.933 --> 30:05.643
Sonya...

30:05.727 --> 30:08.937
You go ahead. Find out
what that was.

30:09.021 --> 30:11.607
Liu and l'll wait right here.

30:11.690 --> 30:12.941
What?

30:19.238 --> 30:22.366
See, me... l believe
in a fair fight.

30:22.450 --> 30:24.826
You know, one-on-one,
man-to-man...

30:24.910 --> 30:28.288
hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.

30:28.330 --> 30:31.123
But what l just saw
wasn't very fair.

30:31.207 --> 30:33.417
That's Kano.

30:33.459 --> 30:35.544
Forget about Kano.

30:35.628 --> 30:37.087
Who's the other guy?

30:37.171 --> 30:40.173
Then he freezes this guy, right?

30:40.256 --> 30:44.010
And then he explodes.
l could see his guts and everything.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.346
Almost lost my lunch.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.641
Disgusting.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.686
What l want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great...

30:55.770 --> 30:58.773
how come he's got such a
crummy looking boat?

30:59.982 --> 31:02.651
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

31:02.692 --> 31:06.488
"Treasure these moments".

31:09.365 --> 31:12.535
That was his intention.

31:12.618 --> 31:15.870
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.

31:15.954 --> 31:18.206
The wise cultivate his favor.

31:19.290 --> 31:21.209
Those who challenge his power...

31:21.292 --> 31:23.502
become his slaves.

31:24.378 --> 31:26.088
Yeah?

31:26.171 --> 31:28.257
l haven't seen any of them around.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.383
You fool!

31:30.466 --> 31:33.094
You know nothing.

31:33.177 --> 31:35.930
He enslaves souls.

31:36.013 --> 31:40.475
He learned the black arts
from the Emperor himself.

31:41.476 --> 31:43.854
You're some kind of royalty too...

31:43.895 --> 31:46.397
- right?
- l am Goro!

31:46.480 --> 31:49.400
general of the armies
of Outworld and prince...

31:49.483 --> 31:52.735
of the subterranean realm of Shokan.

31:52.861 --> 31:54.863
Subterranean?

31:54.904 --> 31:57.574
What's that,
something like underground?

31:57.615 --> 32:00.076
Yes, something like...

32:00.117 --> 32:01.076
that.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.037
l'm kind of an underworld boss.

32:04.955 --> 32:07.623
Well... l mean, back home.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.459
How lucky for them...

32:10.543 --> 32:12.461
"back home".

32:14.255 --> 32:15.797
lt's true...

32:16.464 --> 32:17.924
Prince Goro.

32:19.467 --> 32:24.388
Why else would l have chosen
such a disreputable looking cretin?

32:25.222 --> 32:26.307
Look at him.

32:27.141 --> 32:28.934
No dignity...

32:29.018 --> 32:30.518
no manners.

32:30.602 --> 32:34.522
Yet in the realm of Earth...

32:34.606 --> 32:37.192
such men can amass great wealth...

32:37.275 --> 32:39.610
and almost godlike power.

32:43.405 --> 32:48.117
l'd get back to my amassing
as soon as possible, if you don't mind.

32:48.159 --> 32:50.244
Now, when do l get paid?

32:50.328 --> 32:53.788
After you've fought the girl.
But remember...

32:53.872 --> 32:56.958
she's not to be harmed,
only humiliated.

32:58.293 --> 33:00.961
l have plans for my beautiful Sonya.

33:03.797 --> 33:08.259
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit, Shang Tsung?

33:08.343 --> 33:12.972
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant
is competing in the tournament.

33:13.056 --> 33:17.518
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.

33:17.601 --> 33:20.354
He'll pose no problem.

33:20.437 --> 33:23.189
This is no time for
foolish pride.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.859
We've never been
so close to victory.

33:26.943 --> 33:30.195
Which is why l've come
to warn you of another danger.

33:32.739 --> 33:34.533
Princess Kitana.

33:34.616 --> 33:37.493
The Emperor's adopted daughter?

33:37.535 --> 33:39.745
Why should l worry about her?

33:39.829 --> 33:42.998
Princess Kitana
is 10,000 years old...

33:43.082 --> 33:45.750
and the rightful heir to the
throne of Outworld.

33:45.834 --> 33:49.337
She must not join the forces
from the Realm of Earth...

33:49.420 --> 33:51.840
especially Liu Kang.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.425
What's so special about you?

33:56.468 --> 33:57.719
l don't know.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.221
The Emperor will not
tolerate failure...

34:01.681 --> 34:04.559
and neither will l.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.602
l do not fail.

34:07.686 --> 34:09.603
Let's get out of here.

34:13.483 --> 34:15.693
What? What is it?

34:15.734 --> 34:18.821
We are not alone.

34:26.244 --> 34:28.455
Wait a second,
l don't remember this.

34:34.877 --> 34:35.918
Look!

34:38.420 --> 34:40.630
That has to be Princess Kitana.

34:40.715 --> 34:43.009
She's trying to help us.

34:43.050 --> 34:45.385
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.

34:45.427 --> 34:47.721
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.

34:47.804 --> 34:49.848
- So what?
- Liu?

35:38.306 --> 35:41.017
- What happened?
- There's something here.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.186
lt's following Princess Kitana.

35:43.269 --> 35:45.395
Where is she?

35:45.479 --> 35:46.605
l don't know.

35:53.778 --> 35:57.907
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.908
Kitana went this way.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.497
l can smell her perfume.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.958
l don't smell anything.

36:14.295 --> 36:15.797
l smell something.

36:18.925 --> 36:20.343
Bullshit.

36:33.729 --> 36:35.148
We got company.

37:30.570 --> 37:32.530
Just the way l like them.

37:32.572 --> 37:34.783
Dumb and ugly.

37:34.866 --> 37:37.701
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?

37:37.785 --> 37:40.871
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.706
What is it with you guys?

37:43.790 --> 37:46.584
We're standing...
they're not.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.628
What more do you want?

37:56.301 --> 38:00.096
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

38:02.264 --> 38:05.810
So, why don't you show me
what you plan to do about...

38:05.893 --> 38:06.935
them?

38:20.114 --> 38:22.073
l don't think so.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.796
You'll find that this
is the way out.

38:49.472 --> 38:51.723
You guys are lucky he stopped us.

39:01.899 --> 39:05.653
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?

39:05.736 --> 39:08.697
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?

39:08.780 --> 39:10.657
lf he chooses to.

39:10.699 --> 39:13.325
As a former champion
he has the right to do so.

39:13.409 --> 39:17.455
And he's far more dangerous
than Goro.

39:17.496 --> 39:21.583
His power comes from the souls
of vanquished warriors.

39:21.666 --> 39:23.626
To fight Shang Tsung...

39:23.710 --> 39:25.712
is to face not one...

39:25.795 --> 39:28.006
but a legion of adversaries.

39:28.089 --> 39:29.715
Remember that.

39:34.428 --> 39:37.013
Tomorrow the tournament begins.

39:37.972 --> 39:39.557
Be prepared.

39:54.445 --> 39:56.322
From this moment on...

39:56.363 --> 39:59.657
my island will be your battleground.

40:02.327 --> 40:03.536
Liu Kang!

40:03.578 --> 40:05.829
You will be first.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.457
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

40:20.675 --> 40:22.094
- Let's go!
- Yes!

42:15.984 --> 42:19.071
Your soul is mine.

42:32.499 --> 42:34.292
Fatality.

42:57.270 --> 42:58.521
Sonya Blade!

43:00.815 --> 43:02.858
l have something for you, my dear.

43:02.942 --> 43:05.777
l don't want anything from you.

43:05.860 --> 43:08.196
On the contrary.

43:08.279 --> 43:11.991
l have something you want very much.

43:12.033 --> 43:14.159
You can thank me later.

43:33.635 --> 43:35.428
Hello, baby.

43:35.511 --> 43:37.388
Did you miss me?

43:54.528 --> 43:56.572
Now look at this.

43:56.613 --> 43:59.407
This little baby
brings back memories, doesn't it?

43:59.449 --> 44:02.076
You used it to knife your mother
in the back?

44:03.953 --> 44:07.289
lt put a big smile on your
partner, though. Ear...

44:09.541 --> 44:11.126
to ear...

44:15.963 --> 44:18.466
Give it up. l've studied
all your moves.

44:18.549 --> 44:19.591
Study this.

44:59.334 --> 45:01.169
Does it hurt, baby?

45:20.852 --> 45:22.562
Right. Finish him.

45:23.730 --> 45:25.816
No, Sonya. Don't!

45:27.108 --> 45:29.443
- Give me a break!
- Okay.

46:06.183 --> 46:07.935
Get over here!

46:31.122 --> 46:32.582
Come here!

47:38.639 --> 47:39.890
Welcome!

49:28.484 --> 49:30.069
Get down here!

50:52.557 --> 50:56.018
"To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage"

51:46.812 --> 51:48.229
Begin!

51:57.655 --> 52:00.824
Fight with all of your heart
or there is no hope.

52:00.908 --> 52:02.659
Why do you care if l win?

52:17.713 --> 52:21.717
To win your next match,
use the element which brings life.

52:21.759 --> 52:22.843
What?

52:22.927 --> 52:23.970
Kitana!

52:35.521 --> 52:37.773
Remember my words.

52:37.856 --> 52:39.899
That's enough!

52:41.484 --> 52:43.569
You disappoint me.

52:45.405 --> 52:47.115
Not very wise.

55:31.756 --> 55:34.634
Use the element which brings life.

55:41.307 --> 55:42.725
Water.

56:19.882 --> 56:21.383
ls it time?

56:22.343 --> 56:24.344
Yes.

56:24.427 --> 56:26.846
We've let these humans win enough.

56:28.181 --> 56:30.767
At last.

57:25.313 --> 57:26.481
What the...?

57:39.784 --> 57:41.619
Yeah, that's it! ln and out!

57:52.796 --> 57:54.255
Come on. You can do it!

57:54.297 --> 57:55.798
Move! Use your feet.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.009
Kick him!

58:10.269 --> 58:13.105
Come on, Art. Get up!

58:24.698 --> 58:25.657
Get out!

58:27.075 --> 58:28.577
Finish him.

58:30.245 --> 58:31.120
Get out!

58:41.588 --> 58:43.465
Goro! Goro!

58:43.506 --> 58:45.759
Yes! Goro!

59:04.441 --> 59:05.567
Finish him!

59:09.862 --> 59:12.657
Time to die.

59:12.698 --> 59:13.658
Finish him.

59:52.775 --> 59:55.026
Flawless victory.

59:55.068 --> 59:58.738
Your soul is mine!

01:00:17.087 --> 01:00:18.672
We can't win!

01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:21.842
How can we possibly beat
something like that?

01:00:21.925 --> 01:00:24.552
Good question.

01:00:24.635 --> 01:00:27.680
Goro can be killed.

01:00:27.763 --> 01:00:32.350
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed
by mortal men and women.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.896
You can overcome any adversary...

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:40.858
no matter how bizarre
their powers may seem.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.694
There is always a way.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:48.072
Only one thing can defeat you:

01:00:48.156 --> 01:00:50.325
Your own fear.

01:00:50.408 --> 01:00:52.619
So, who says we're afraid?

01:00:54.369 --> 01:00:57.080
You must first face your fears...

01:00:57.122 --> 01:01:00.042
if you are to conquer them.

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:03.461
You, Johnny, are afraid
you're a fake...

01:01:03.544 --> 01:01:07.632
so you'll rush into any fight
just to prove you're not.

01:01:09.758 --> 01:01:11.551
You'll fight...

01:01:11.593 --> 01:01:13.470
bravely enough...

01:01:13.553 --> 01:01:15.262
but foolishly...

01:01:15.346 --> 01:01:17.264
carelessly...

01:01:17.348 --> 01:01:19.433
and you'll be beaten.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:25.271
You, Sonya...

01:01:25.313 --> 01:01:29.275
are afraid to admit even you
sometimes need help.

01:01:33.737 --> 01:01:36.490
lf you are afraid to trust...

01:01:37.324 --> 01:01:39.617
you will lose.

01:01:46.498 --> 01:01:47.916
Wait.

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:49.626
Wait.

01:01:50.877 --> 01:01:51.962
What about me?

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:54.588
Oh, you.

01:01:54.672 --> 01:01:57.341
You fear your own destiny.

01:01:57.424 --> 01:02:01.010
You already fled once
when you went to America, so...

01:02:01.094 --> 01:02:03.179
you're guilty about Chan's death.

01:02:03.263 --> 01:02:05.390
l am responsible for Chan's death.

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:09.810
Every mortal is responsible
for his own destiny.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.479
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.523
l tried.

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:18.359
Despair is the most dangerous fear.

01:02:18.442 --> 01:02:20.444
l know this...

01:02:20.528 --> 01:02:22.696
and so does Shang Tsung.

01:02:22.779 --> 01:02:25.657
He can peer into your soul...

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:28.410
and use the fear he sees against you.

01:02:29.327 --> 01:02:31.495
You must be prepared.

01:02:55.057 --> 01:02:57.393
Liu!

01:02:57.435 --> 01:02:59.978
You will be next.

01:03:12.615 --> 01:03:15.491
Goro's never been beaten.

01:03:15.575 --> 01:03:17.785
You go up against him,
he'll kill you.

01:03:17.869 --> 01:03:19.287
lf l don't...

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.123
then he'll finish us off
one at a time.

01:03:23.665 --> 01:03:25.584
lf l challenge him now...

01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:29.087
l can finish this.

01:03:29.171 --> 01:03:32.089
You're making this sound simple
and it isn't.

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:33.758
Yeah, it is.

01:03:35.176 --> 01:03:38.887
'Cause l can't let what happened
to Art happen to you.

01:03:40.472 --> 01:03:42.974
Not to you.

01:03:43.058 --> 01:03:46.810
Oh, don't you dare do this
to protect me, Johnny Cage.

01:03:46.894 --> 01:03:49.521
Trust me. l've a plan.

01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:52.982
l don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical...

01:03:53.066 --> 01:03:55.860
self-deluded person l have ever met.

01:03:55.944 --> 01:03:57.904
You forgot "good looking."

01:04:04.034 --> 01:04:06.994
Challenging Goro, eh?

01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:10.206
You weren't supposed
to fight him now.

01:04:10.289 --> 01:04:12.792
Are you that eager to die?

01:04:12.875 --> 01:04:14.418
l'm not the one who'll die.

01:04:17.796 --> 01:04:19.214
l see.

01:04:20.006 --> 01:04:21.716
You're very foolish.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.552
The true sign of a hero.

01:04:24.635 --> 01:04:26.762
You want to protect your friends.

01:04:26.804 --> 01:04:29.430
But make no mistake.

01:04:30.473 --> 01:04:32.809
They too will die...

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:35.562
after Goro destroys you.

01:04:35.645 --> 01:04:38.105
So what's the problem?

01:04:39.147 --> 01:04:41.275
As you wish.

01:04:41.316 --> 01:04:45.486
As absurd as your request is,
l shall grant it.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:50.491
ln return l reserve the right
to challenge the winner myself.

01:04:50.575 --> 01:04:53.285
Or another of my choosing.

01:04:53.326 --> 01:04:57.289
ln a place designated by me
for the final battle...

01:04:57.372 --> 01:04:58.957
of the tournament.

01:05:00.416 --> 01:05:03.002
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.

01:05:07.255 --> 01:05:09.507
Too late, Lord Rayden.

01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:12.635
The rules are quite clear.

01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:15.512
lt's... How do you say?

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.182
"A deal's a deal."

01:05:24.729 --> 01:05:26.188
What have you done?

01:05:26.272 --> 01:05:28.566
l made a choice.

01:05:28.649 --> 01:05:30.984
This is our tournament, remember?

01:05:31.026 --> 01:05:32.444
Mortal Kombat.

01:05:32.527 --> 01:05:34.446
We fight it.

01:05:41.285 --> 01:05:42.912
Good.

01:05:42.995 --> 01:05:45.872
At last one of them has understood.

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:51.377
Goro! Goro!

01:06:54.765 --> 01:06:57.059
Finish him quickly.

01:06:57.101 --> 01:06:58.768
Pay me my tribute.

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:02.397
This puny mortal
will be no problem.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.774
l'll crush him in one blow.

01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:06.400
Alright.

01:07:07.526 --> 01:07:08.694
Let's dance.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:21.413
Yes! Sorry.

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:28.627
You imbecile.

01:07:32.673 --> 01:07:34.717
Damn, that hurt.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.718
Follow him.

01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:37.802
Finish him.

01:07:43.682 --> 01:07:46.143
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!

01:07:48.854 --> 01:07:51.147
Finish him! Finish him!

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.682
Those were $500 sunglasses,
asshole.

01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:53.201
This is where you fall down.

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:10.883
Let me go!

01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:13.176
Stop!

01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:18.890
l hereby exercise my right
to challenge.

01:09:18.932 --> 01:09:21.267
l challenge her.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.769
You're a coward, sorcerer.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:25.270
Stand and fight.

01:09:25.312 --> 01:09:27.814
We had a deal, remember?

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:30.859
Mortal Kombat continues.
l'm simply...

01:09:30.942 --> 01:09:32.861
changing the place...

01:09:34.988 --> 01:09:37.281
as we agreed.

01:09:40.117 --> 01:09:42.077
- Sonya!
- Wait!

01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:48.541
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle...

01:09:48.624 --> 01:09:51.960
in the wastelands of Outworld,
where l cannot follow.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.962
We can.

01:09:54.045 --> 01:09:57.757
Rayden...Can Sonya
beat Shang Tsung?

01:09:59.466 --> 01:10:00.676
l'm sorry.

01:10:00.759 --> 01:10:03.387
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.722
Neglected to mention it.

01:10:05.805 --> 01:10:09.767
She must accept the challenge
or there'll be no final combat.

01:10:09.851 --> 01:10:13.812
l have nothing further
to teach you, Liu Kang.

01:10:13.896 --> 01:10:15.647
You possess the knowledge.

01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:19.359
All that is lacking now is the will.

01:10:19.443 --> 01:10:21.611
You sure you don't want to go?

01:10:21.694 --> 01:10:24.489
ln Outworld, if you look
hard enough...

01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:26.491
you will find another guide.

01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:37.374
Good luck.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.220
They'll need it.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.349
This is not good.

01:10:55.432 --> 01:10:57.767
But l'm fine.

01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:59.936
l can deal with this.

01:11:03.272 --> 01:11:06.775
So... this is Outworld.

01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:09.611
l can see why they want
a change of scenery.

01:11:09.694 --> 01:11:11.780
We should head for that tower.

01:11:11.863 --> 01:11:14.114
He'd have taken Sonya there.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.467
l hate this place.

01:11:36.551 --> 01:11:39.554
l do. l'm telling you l hate it.

01:11:39.637 --> 01:11:42.348
A hostile environment,
l'm unprepared...

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:45.100
with people who want to kick my ass.

01:11:45.183 --> 01:11:47.561
lt's like being back in high school!

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.771
What's that?

01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:53.649
Wait.

01:11:54.233 --> 01:11:55.651
What?

01:11:56.277 --> 01:11:58.236
There's something else.

01:11:58.278 --> 01:11:59.737
Oh, great.

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.534
What are you doing?

01:12:10.372 --> 01:12:11.623
What are you doing?

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:43.692
Reptile.

01:15:43.348 --> 01:15:45.308
Oh no, you don't.

01:15:53.357 --> 01:15:54.942
Well done.

01:15:57.777 --> 01:16:00.113
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.

01:16:00.154 --> 01:16:01.614
Kitana.

01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:03.533
Come with me.

01:16:06.368 --> 01:16:08.328
What happened here?

01:16:09.496 --> 01:16:12.832
The same thing that will happen
to your world...

01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:15.000
unless you prevent it.

01:16:17.419 --> 01:16:21.339
My father was the rightful ruler
of Outworld

01:16:23.299 --> 01:16:26.969
Then his best warriors
lost ten Mortal Kombats...

01:16:27.052 --> 01:16:29.596
and the Emperor entered the Realm...

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.266
killed my parents and adopted me...

01:16:32.349 --> 01:16:34.434
to lay claim to the throne.

01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:41.149
but it was beautiful once...

01:16:41.232 --> 01:16:45.318
before Shang Tsung engineered
its destruction.

01:16:45.402 --> 01:16:48.530
How can l stop this from happening
in my world?

01:16:48.613 --> 01:16:50.948
lf l did not believe in you...

01:16:51.031 --> 01:16:52.867
l would not have helped you.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.871
ln the Black Tower you will face
three challenges.

01:16:57.954 --> 01:17:01.583
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:04.751
And you must face your worst fear.

01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:24.029
l will not fight you, Shang Tsung.

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:26.906
l am not playing your game.

01:18:29.534 --> 01:18:30.993
My sweet Sonya.

01:18:31.077 --> 01:18:33.037
There's no one else.

01:18:33.121 --> 01:18:35.163
lf you don't fight...

01:18:35.247 --> 01:18:37.749
the Realm of Earth will
forfeit the Tournament...

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:40.793
and its portals will open...

01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:43.629
to our great Emperor.

01:18:43.712 --> 01:18:45.464
You're lying.

01:18:46.424 --> 01:18:48.299
My friends will come for me.

01:18:49.634 --> 01:18:51.469
Hoping against hope.

01:18:51.511 --> 01:18:55.722
Such an endearing human trait.
l'm touched. Really.

01:18:57.808 --> 01:19:00.185
One last chance, Sonya.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:02.229
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.

01:19:02.312 --> 01:19:04.105
Go to hell.

01:19:05.648 --> 01:19:07.442
Take her away.

01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:10.777
The Emperor will be overjoyed.

01:19:13.822 --> 01:19:15.449
My friends will come.

01:19:18.784 --> 01:19:20.119
They're already here.

01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:25.832
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:30.044
Will you dare interfere
with the tournament...

01:19:30.128 --> 01:19:32.714
and betray our Emperor?

01:19:32.797 --> 01:19:36.258
ln his great wisdom, he knows
that Mortal Kombat...

01:19:36.341 --> 01:19:38.260
cannot be won by treachery.

01:19:38.343 --> 01:19:41.679
How dare you speak to me
of treachery?

01:19:41.721 --> 01:19:45.683
Your ignorance will lose forever...

01:19:45.725 --> 01:19:48.059
the keys to the Realm of Earth.

01:19:49.102 --> 01:19:50.687
Very well.

01:19:55.233 --> 01:19:57.193
l challenge you.

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:00.780
You'll fight me.

01:20:06.117 --> 01:20:07.827
l am Liu Kang...

01:20:07.911 --> 01:20:10.330
descendant of Kung Lao.

01:20:11.246 --> 01:20:14.208
l challenge you to Mortal Kombat.

01:20:14.249 --> 01:20:17.086
Do you accept or yield?

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.214
l accept.

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.008
Leave us.

01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:29.012
l will take care..

01:20:29.096 --> 01:20:32.057
of this impudent mortal myself.

01:20:45.777 --> 01:20:47.737
Nice dress.

01:21:55.754 --> 01:21:57.672
You fool.

01:22:08.515 --> 01:22:10.308
What's that noise?

01:22:10.349 --> 01:22:13.394
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.

01:22:13.478 --> 01:22:15.480
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:23.653
Face your enemy.

01:23:50.019 --> 01:23:52.188
ls that all you've got, sorcerer?

01:23:53.648 --> 01:23:55.232
Liu Kang!

01:23:56.608 --> 01:23:59.278
l can see into your soul.

01:23:59.361 --> 01:24:02.989
You will die.

01:24:06.951 --> 01:24:08.578
Face yourself.

01:24:08.661 --> 01:24:12.205
You can look into my soul...

01:24:12.289 --> 01:24:14.124
but you don't own it.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.886
Face your worst fear.

01:24:27.969 --> 01:24:30.305
l'm not afraid of my destiny.

01:24:30.346 --> 01:24:31.805
Face me.

01:24:36.643 --> 01:24:37.644
Liu.

01:24:40.313 --> 01:24:41.397
Chan?

01:24:44.484 --> 01:24:45.818
lt can't be you.

01:24:48.195 --> 01:24:50.155
Rayden sent me.

01:24:50.822 --> 01:24:52.366
To help you.

01:24:52.449 --> 01:24:54.325
You're not really Chan.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.038
Remember when our parents died?

01:25:02.165 --> 01:25:04.834
You promised you'd always
take care of me?

01:25:08.546 --> 01:25:09.797
l remember.

01:25:11.548 --> 01:25:13.842
lt's my turn to take care of you.

01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:21.849
Come with me.

01:25:26.895 --> 01:25:28.480
l forgive you for letting me die.

01:25:33.901 --> 01:25:35.486
lt wasn't my fault.

01:25:37.947 --> 01:25:39.447
- Brother.
- No.

01:25:41.908 --> 01:25:44.035
Chan chose his own path.

01:25:45.286 --> 01:25:48.247
Every man is responsible
for his own destiny.

01:25:49.707 --> 01:25:51.625
Shang Tsung killed my brother.

01:25:53.627 --> 01:25:54.794
You're mine.

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:23.902
The Chosen One.

01:26:42.627 --> 01:26:44.838
l am The Chosen One.

01:26:53.928 --> 01:26:56.014
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?

01:26:59.976 --> 01:27:03.687
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.

01:27:04.563 --> 01:27:06.065
Free them.

01:27:07.816 --> 01:27:11.694
They are mine forever.

01:27:26.832 --> 01:27:29.794
All those souls,
and you don't have your own.

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.586
l pity you, sorcerer.

01:27:34.631 --> 01:27:37.509
Save your pity for the weak.

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:38.592
Surrender!

01:27:52.188 --> 01:27:54.189
Never!

01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:35.600
Flawless victory.

01:29:21.432 --> 01:29:22.933
l knew you'd come.

01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:25.268
Chan.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:30.273
One day...

01:29:30.315 --> 01:29:32.274
we will be reunited...

01:29:34.401 --> 01:29:37.946
but until then my spirit
will always be with you.

01:29:40.448 --> 01:29:42.367
Go in peace, my brother.

01:30:22.735 --> 01:30:24.820
Let's go home..

01:30:46.755 --> 01:30:48.799
l've been waiting for you.

01:30:48.882 --> 01:30:51.135
What took you so long?

01:30:51.176 --> 01:30:53.886
l guess you knew it would
end this way.

01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:56.014
Didn't have a clue.

01:30:58.474 --> 01:31:01.268
You humans are so unpredictable.

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:06.481
l must tell you something...
you guys did great.

01:31:08.774 --> 01:31:12.486
- Bow to me!
- What is it?

01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:15.613
The Emperor.

01:31:21.411 --> 01:31:25.372
You weak, pathetic fools.
l've come for your souls.

01:31:26.165 --> 01:31:27.708
l don't think so.

01:41:12.548 --> 01:41:13.965
Excellent!

01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:18.428
Flawless victory!
