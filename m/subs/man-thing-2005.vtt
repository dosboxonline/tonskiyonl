01:18.156 --> 01:21.921
There is a
sacred place in the deep swamp...

01:22.484 --> 01:25.374
where the mangrove trees
grow close together...

01:25.945 --> 01:28.578
and the rays of the sun
are never seen.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.302
My people call this place
the "Dark Water."

01:34.007 --> 01:37.382
It is here that the spirit
of the swamp lives.

01:42.671 --> 01:46.624
This place was always filled
with life and beauty.

01:47.531 --> 01:49.601
But evil men
have changed that...

01:50.226 --> 01:53.265
with their drills, their pipes,

01:53.924 --> 01:56.843
greed and murder.

02:08.874 --> 02:12.195
Now the swamp
cries out a warning:

02:12.648 --> 02:16.132
A time of retribution is here.

02:57.288 --> 02:59.109
- Wait!
- Hey!

02:59.781 --> 03:01.015
Whoa!

03:03.726 --> 03:04.843
Mmm!

03:08.898 --> 03:10.679
Not here, Billy.

03:13.242 --> 03:14.554
Wait!

03:20.043 --> 03:22.531
Sarah! Stop!

03:24.171 --> 03:25.679
I mean it, Sarah!
Stop!

03:25.867 --> 03:27.123
Come on, Billy!

03:27.796 --> 03:29.195
I don't want to!

03:30.351 --> 03:32.671
Come on back to the fire.
This swamp's dangerous.

03:37.546 --> 03:39.640
You're out of your goddamn mind!

03:48.953 --> 03:51.140
Have you
heard the stories about this place?

03:55.585 --> 03:56.502
Hey.

03:57.179 --> 03:59.476
People disappear down here
all the time, girl.

04:00.601 --> 04:02.300
Why you being so crazy, huh?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.835
You're not afraid of the dark,
are you, Billy boy?

04:04.874 --> 04:07.489
Oh, hell no. That ain't it.
This place has got bad mojo.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.921
- 'Fraidy cat.
- Oh, shit!

04:21.719 --> 04:25.140
- You still afraid, Billy boy?
- We shouldn't be doin' this out here.

04:28.678 --> 04:30.031
Holy shit!

04:33.351 --> 04:35.421
You seem like a virgin, Billy.

04:43.513 --> 04:45.554
I ain't no fuckin' virgin.

04:53.445 --> 04:55.257
Oh, yeah!
Oh!

05:10.351 --> 05:13.390
- Oh, my God!
- You liked that, huh, baby?

05:13.531 --> 05:14.867
That was good, huh?

05:15.616 --> 05:18.288
Oh, my God!

06:06.015 --> 06:08.562
So, you're taking
me the scenic route, huh?

06:09.804 --> 06:12.745
What the hell are you
doin' down here anyway, boy?

06:13.226 --> 06:16.531
Start a new life, maybe.
Lookin' for some peace and quiet.

06:17.304 --> 06:17.999
You know.

06:20.132 --> 06:23.007
You city boys sure are funny.

06:31.499 --> 06:33.218
Why do they call it "Bywater"?

06:34.413 --> 06:37.210
Because it's by the water.

07:07.710 --> 07:10.460
No. No, ma'am.
No, I can't.

07:10.651 --> 07:12.828
I'm sorry, but I have to stay put.

07:14.247 --> 07:16.460
Ma'am, I don't know
where your son is.

07:18.694 --> 07:21.749
- I gotta get out of this town.
- So why would you wanna leave paradise?

07:23.903 --> 07:26.562
- Man, you scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry about that.

07:26.898 --> 07:28.718
I'm Kyle Williams,
the new sheriff.

07:29.945 --> 07:31.507
You must be Eric Fraser, yeah?

07:31.832 --> 07:33.773
Yeah, yeah.
Fraser'll do.

07:35.132 --> 07:37.328
- What?
- No offense, but...

07:37.467 --> 07:40.015
Well, I just expected
someone more...

07:40.572 --> 07:44.085
more experienced,
I mean, considerin'...

07:44.347 --> 07:45.757
Considering what?

07:59.632 --> 08:01.804
See, Sheriff Corely, he, uh...

08:02.130 --> 08:06.031
Well, he kind of went insane
before he disappeared.

08:11.359 --> 08:13.601
That's a lot of missing
persons for a small town.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.898
I guess they didn't
fill you in all the way.

08:19.187 --> 08:22.476
It started with this Indian
medicine man... Ted Sallis.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.445
He was the first one
to disappear.

08:24.574 --> 08:27.859
Corely thought Sallis
put a curse on Bywater.

08:29.406 --> 08:31.703
- Hey, I can take all this down.
- No.

08:34.585 --> 08:35.796
Leave it.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.851
- So what do you think, Fraser?
- I don't know.

08:40.385 --> 08:43.312
Gator attacks.
Murder, possibly.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.624
Possibly.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.609
Another one disappeared
last night.

08:47.686 --> 08:50.132
Local boy.
Billy James.

08:50.428 --> 08:51.984
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

08:55.078 --> 08:56.374
Who's Rene Laroque?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.367
He's a local troublemaker.

08:59.189 --> 09:01.671
Corely thought he and Sallis
were in this together.

09:01.945 --> 09:03.523
Called him
a "shape-shifter."

09:04.687 --> 09:06.250
But we could never catch him.

09:06.523 --> 09:07.796
Why can't you catch him?

09:08.890 --> 09:10.421
Why can't we catch him?

09:11.838 --> 09:14.171
Hell, you ain't never been in that
swamp before, have you?

09:14.937 --> 09:15.898
Well--

09:20.973 --> 09:22.175
Deputy Fraser.

09:22.749 --> 09:23.929
Oh, hey, Val.

09:24.107 --> 09:25.347
It's the coroner.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.304
Whoa, whoa. What?

09:29.491 --> 09:31.062
Oh, my God.

09:34.326 --> 09:35.406
Is that Billy?

09:36.848 --> 09:37.929
Yeah.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.601
That's Billy.

09:41.825 --> 09:43.515
Fraser, you go wait outside.

09:45.242 --> 09:47.117
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

09:53.298 --> 09:54.601
Cause of death?

09:55.701 --> 09:58.796
Only thing around here large
enough to do this, Sheriff, is a gator.

09:59.909 --> 10:01.710
You know, there's a...
there's a girl that was with him.

10:01.778 --> 10:04.531
She might've seen what happened.
She's down at the hospital here.

10:07.429 --> 10:08.820
Is this normal?

10:09.713 --> 10:11.140
This green stuff?

10:11.488 --> 10:15.492
Sheriff, this body has been in
the swamp. You understand?

10:16.212 --> 10:18.031
Yeah, for one night.

10:22.935 --> 10:26.249
Mr. Schist just called. There's
a disturbance at the oil site.

10:26.632 --> 10:29.015
Can you go? I'd like to
stick with this right now.

10:29.148 --> 10:31.578
Mr. Schist asked if
you could handle it personally.

10:32.587 --> 10:35.374
Said he wants the new sheriff
to see what he's been up against.

10:36.438 --> 10:37.476
Okay.

10:43.389 --> 10:46.195
- I want a full autopsy.
- You got it.

10:50.497 --> 10:54.343
I appreciate your rights to free assembly,

10:54.929 --> 10:57.492
but this here's
private property.

10:59.113 --> 11:01.968
Now, we can cut you out
one by one,

11:02.117 --> 11:05.812
or one of you can tell me
where the key is to that chain.

11:06.678 --> 11:11.054
This is not a goddamn park.
This is a work site!

11:11.853 --> 11:14.359
Surely you got a home to go to, girlie.

11:15.187 --> 11:17.523
Now, I've been real patient
with you folk.

11:18.046 --> 11:21.538
- But you all are trespassin'.
- You just listen to the man!

11:21.781 --> 11:25.734
I'm givin' you
one last chance to disperse!

11:26.353 --> 11:30.304
Or else, I'm gonna drag you
out by that chain...

11:31.023 --> 11:33.507
Fraser,
I'm real glad you're here.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.460
I want all these folk arrested.

11:35.537 --> 11:36.874
Now, now, Jake.

11:37.374 --> 11:39.554
This is Kyle Williams,
our new sheriff.

11:40.529 --> 11:43.343
- Sheriff, this is Jake Schist.
- Mornin'.

11:43.424 --> 11:46.453
He's a foreman here for his dad,
headin' up the new drillin' operations.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.734
Good. You can arrest 'em.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.433
Arresting all of them
might be a little difficult.

11:51.671 --> 11:53.343
Let me see what I can do.

11:56.359 --> 11:57.808
All right, everyone!

11:58.398 --> 12:00.570
I appreciate
your right to free assembly,

12:00.656 --> 12:02.492
but this is
a privately-owned work site.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.406
Your actions here are illegal.

12:06.429 --> 12:09.460
You gotta get your asses up
out of the mud and go home.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.484
Who the hell are you?

12:12.163 --> 12:16.726
- I'm the new sheriff, ma'am.
- Well, have a taste of country hospitality, Sheriff.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.109
Our asses aren't goin' anywhere.

12:19.201 --> 12:22.038
Why don't y'all go fuck a tree,
ya hippie bitch?

12:22.218 --> 12:23.351
Here.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.695
- Fraser.
- Oh. Got it, chief.

12:28.788 --> 12:29.788
Ma'am,

12:30.249 --> 12:31.585
right or wrong,
this is my job.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.070
Yeah, well, this is about a
different kind of law, Sheriff.

12:34.413 --> 12:38.843
Schist has been committing a crime against
these people on this land for long enough.

12:39.453 --> 12:40.687
You got handcuffs.

12:41.359 --> 12:42.781
Put 'em on Schist.

12:45.882 --> 12:47.335
Bolt cutters.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.148
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doin'?

12:54.796 --> 12:57.429
Sheriff, I-I'm sorry.

12:58.273 --> 12:59.593
Are you all right?

13:01.454 --> 13:03.953
- Walk or ride?
- What did you say?

13:05.171 --> 13:07.015
Put me down!
What do you think you're doin'?

13:07.040 --> 13:10.038
This is a violation of my
civil rights! Put me down now!

13:10.063 --> 13:13.420
You have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used against you...

13:13.445 --> 13:14.718
- in a court of law.
- Who do you think you are?

13:14.743 --> 13:17.718
- Fraser, cut everyone loose.
- I want to speak to my attorney!

13:17.743 --> 13:19.959
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I want a lawyer! Put me down!

13:19.984 --> 13:22.421
If you can't afford an attorney, one will
be appointed to you.

13:23.445 --> 13:24.710
Get in the car.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.921
You had better be arresting me,

13:28.053 --> 13:30.187
'cause I'm gonna kick
your city-boy ass...

13:35.070 --> 13:37.038
Got in straight to work,
Sheriff.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.964
I like that.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.703
Howdy, Sheriff.

13:40.828 --> 13:42.820
- Frederic Schist.
- Kyle Williams.

13:42.943 --> 13:46.585
Hell of a way to spend your first day
on the job, Kyle. I hate this. I really do.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.960
These are good folk.
I sympathize.

13:49.615 --> 13:52.851
Can't let the goddamn flies
spoil the picnic, Sheriff.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.945
You're gonna hear a lot
about me around here.

13:56.414 --> 13:59.296
I'm the, uh, big fish
in the small pond.

13:59.687 --> 14:02.312
Bottom line is,
I'm not breakin' any laws.

14:02.390 --> 14:05.851
Not any American laws, anyways.
And I paid a bundle for this land.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.585
What do you mean,
"American laws"?

14:10.006 --> 14:13.992
Well, you're gonna hear
that honey that you arrested...

14:14.989 --> 14:17.070
sing about tribal laws.

14:17.643 --> 14:19.296
Horseshit excuses...

14:19.348 --> 14:23.726
for terrorists to put sand
in my gears.

14:24.483 --> 14:26.874
But is there something you
wanna tell me?

14:27.726 --> 14:29.156
Something specific?

14:29.364 --> 14:31.882
You're a straight shooter,
ain't you? I like that.

14:33.554 --> 14:36.788
Well, there is, uh,
someone specific.

14:37.296 --> 14:38.605
Rene Laroque.

14:39.328 --> 14:40.953
He's part Indian.

14:41.710 --> 14:44.593
Hell, he could be out there
in the swamp killin' people.

14:44.878 --> 14:47.562
Lives out there like an animal.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.484
Sir, before I, um,
arrest anybody,

14:51.598 --> 14:55.085
- I need to conduct my own proper investigation.
- Of course you do.

14:55.898 --> 14:59.203
What I'm sayin' is, it needs
to be sooner rather than later.

14:59.833 --> 15:03.312
Let me tell you.
When the dust has settled,

15:04.855 --> 15:07.148
you'll find this
a nice place to live.

15:08.571 --> 15:10.906
- Isn't that right, Jake?
- Yes, sir.

15:11.028 --> 15:12.468
Real nice place to live.

15:12.795 --> 15:14.398
I'll make sure of it.

15:15.187 --> 15:16.742
Thank you, Mr. Schist.

15:20.913 --> 15:21.820
Jake.

15:22.866 --> 15:24.695
Get that dozer movin'!

15:28.697 --> 15:30.015
Pa.

15:32.008 --> 15:34.398
He's kind of young
to be a sheriff, ain't he?

15:35.061 --> 15:36.835
Yes, he is.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.070
That's the idea.

15:54.601 --> 15:57.699
- Name?
- Teri Elizabeth Richards.

15:58.372 --> 16:00.882
Occupation?
I teach third grade.

16:02.517 --> 16:05.020
You think getting arrested's setting
a good example for your students?

16:05.068 --> 16:07.945
Well, I think standin' up for your
principles sets a good example.

16:08.170 --> 16:09.710
So, yes, I do.

16:10.194 --> 16:12.754
So, you've been
arrested five times.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.484
One more and you
get the decoder ring.

16:14.509 --> 16:17.859
Sheriff, that swamp has been
my backyard since I was born.

16:18.689 --> 16:21.562
It's part of me,
and I happen to love it.

16:21.953 --> 16:23.882
That's not Schist's land.

16:24.076 --> 16:26.960
It's ancestral land,
and it's sacred to the tribe.

16:28.314 --> 16:30.796
Besides, the tribe didn't see
a cent of Schist's money.

16:30.996 --> 16:33.570
Their leader, Ted Sallis,
took it and ran.

16:35.769 --> 16:36.992
Okay.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.085
Okay, I'm listening.

16:41.548 --> 16:45.749
I mean, no one wants to see, because Schist
is so busy pumpin' money into the town.

16:47.917 --> 16:50.163
But, Sheriff,
this swamp is dying.

16:51.472 --> 16:53.124
People are dying.

16:56.967 --> 16:58.406
Rene Laroque.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.406
Do you know him?

17:02.590 --> 17:04.382
Sheriff, this is a small town.

17:04.796 --> 17:07.413
- Everybody knows everybody.
- Can you help me find him?

17:07.878 --> 17:09.718
He's not that easy to find.

17:12.775 --> 17:13.894
Okay.

17:15.733 --> 17:16.976
You can go.

17:18.843 --> 17:20.233
You're not chargin' me?

17:21.117 --> 17:22.781
Like you said,
it's a small town.

17:23.012 --> 17:25.007
So if I was to charge
a third grade schoolteacher...

17:25.060 --> 17:26.867
whose worst crime
is caring for the environment...

17:27.921 --> 17:29.421
on my first day...

17:29.972 --> 17:31.585
That's not the way
I'd like to get started.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.380
You can go.

17:36.584 --> 17:37.726
Fine.

18:02.251 --> 18:03.593
How you doin'?

18:34.820 --> 18:36.624
I thought diners were
supposed to be friendly.

18:36.678 --> 18:39.367
Well, for the new sheriff,
first coffee's free.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.781
Thank you.

18:42.078 --> 18:44.554
Second one is twice the price.

18:45.253 --> 18:46.960
- There you go.
- Thanks.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.960
- Mornin', Sheriff.
- How you doin'?

19:02.312 --> 19:05.601
Uh, what brings
you here, warrant or pleasure?

19:08.046 --> 19:10.085
- Got a sweet tooth.
- Uh-huh.

19:10.704 --> 19:13.873
Well, Sheriff Williams,
meet another sugar addict.

19:14.343 --> 19:15.663
This is Pete Horn.

19:16.021 --> 19:19.210
Oh, Pete, this is the nice man
that arrested me yesterday.

19:20.734 --> 19:21.773
Howdy.

19:22.737 --> 19:24.484
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.958
- Pleasure, Pete.
- Do you mind?

19:27.896 --> 19:28.921
Here.

19:38.171 --> 19:41.554
- Breakfast, Sheriff?
- Eggs and grits, I guess.

19:48.297 --> 19:51.617
- Can I help you?
- No, I don't think you can.

19:54.157 --> 19:55.609
But I can help you.

19:57.128 --> 20:00.171
Welcome to Dodge City, Sheriff.
This is the showdown, man.

20:00.316 --> 20:03.066
All the legends around here
are true. It's incredible.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.335
Yeah?

20:05.453 --> 20:07.687
Come out to my place
in the swamp, man,

20:07.752 --> 20:11.249
and I could show you some things
if you have the courage to believe.

20:11.305 --> 20:15.835
Ploog! What the hell you
doin', you freaky piece of shit?

20:16.156 --> 20:17.624
Heel, boys. Heel.

20:17.666 --> 20:19.882
I told you not to
bring them dogs in here.

20:20.037 --> 20:23.148
- Excuse me. I didn't realize you were the law around here.
- You're lucky I didn't eat 'em.

20:25.733 --> 20:30.171
Good luck, Sheriff. You have a fine
time with the Bywater breakfast club.

20:30.843 --> 20:32.930
I've seen this show before.
I gotta go.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.179
Bye, Pete.

20:34.976 --> 20:37.163
- Take care.
- Got a kiss for me?

20:37.687 --> 20:40.390
- Yeah, right.
- Don't go fillin' the new sheriff's head...

20:40.442 --> 20:42.257
with your bullshit, Ploog.

20:42.303 --> 20:46.773
Hey. Don't pay him no never
mind, Sheriff. He coon crazy.

20:47.078 --> 20:48.242
Crazy as a coon.

20:48.322 --> 20:50.726
Hey! Ooh-wee!
That sure is...

20:50.782 --> 20:52.820
- one shiny new badge, Sheriff.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

20:52.889 --> 20:55.226
- Don't put your hands on me, mister.
- Thibodeaux.

20:55.703 --> 21:00.820
- Wayne Thi-bo-deaux.
- Yeah.

21:01.413 --> 21:03.601
Why don't you take your friend,
Mr...

21:03.662 --> 21:05.497
Rodney Thibodeaux.
We're brothers.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.640
Well, your mother must be proud.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.913
So, please, sit down, gentlemen.

21:11.652 --> 21:13.304
Let a man have his coffee.

21:15.085 --> 21:16.038
Hey!

21:16.735 --> 21:18.218
I was just foolin'.

21:20.101 --> 21:21.519
Just jokin' with ya.

21:31.671 --> 21:34.390
No man can stand
against it alone.

21:35.507 --> 21:36.554
What?

21:37.171 --> 21:38.960
Something is out there...

21:40.788 --> 21:42.187
waiting.

22:40.710 --> 22:43.570
- How long has she been like this?
- Since they brought her in.

22:43.674 --> 22:45.242
It's like we're not even here.

22:46.233 --> 22:47.499
Tell me if anything changes--

23:19.200 --> 23:23.078
Sheriff, it's Fraser. Schist
wants you back over at the work site.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.953
Thanks for fittin' us into
your busy schedule, Sheriff.

23:40.109 --> 23:41.804
Fraser could've
come out earlier.

23:42.374 --> 23:44.890
I think you need
to see this for yourself.

23:45.539 --> 23:47.515
You had some vandalism here
last night?

23:48.501 --> 23:50.023
You could call it that.

23:53.837 --> 23:56.085
Had to cancel
an entire day's work.

23:56.344 --> 23:57.527
They hit every rig.

23:57.984 --> 24:00.124
Slashed the belts, slashed the pipes.

24:00.554 --> 24:02.359
Hell, this time,
they stole some dynamite.

24:02.419 --> 24:05.687
I'm already months behind here.
You understand, Sheriff?

24:09.008 --> 24:12.374
You gonna do a damn thing about
Rene Laroque, or just take pictures?

24:14.367 --> 24:15.906
You think this was done
by Laroque?

24:16.820 --> 24:19.507
Hell, yeah!
Red-skinned motherfucker.

24:19.859 --> 24:23.273
And that old madman Pete
Horn, he's behind this too.

24:23.335 --> 24:26.398
Yeah? Don't you think he's a
little old to be running a revolution?

24:26.452 --> 24:28.288
It don't make no difference
how old they get.

24:28.352 --> 24:31.179
You can't trust 'em...
Injuns and Coloreds both.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.429
- Steve, I don't think the sheriff needs...
- They hate us!

24:33.470 --> 24:36.288
I mean, the first chance
they get, they strike at you.

24:36.335 --> 24:38.562
First thing, they're
snoopin' around stealin' things.

24:38.722 --> 24:40.992
Next thing you know, they'll
burn this place to the ground.

24:41.019 --> 24:44.281
You see if they don't.
You can't trust 'em. Shit.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.110
There's all kinds of people you
can't trust in this world, mister.

24:47.367 --> 24:50.499
- I put racist assholes at the top of that list.
- Hey, come on, brother.

24:50.585 --> 24:52.859
They all think I ripped
'em off. Hell, Sheriff,

24:52.900 --> 24:55.320
I was the one
that overpaid for swampland.

24:55.546 --> 24:57.851
- It was that old crook Sallis who started this.
- Jake!

24:57.905 --> 25:02.116
Well, it was! He skipped town with
the money. He's one of their own.

25:02.499 --> 25:04.953
Someone breaks the law,
they have my full attention.

25:05.627 --> 25:08.879
But as far as I'm concerned, this is
an open case until I get hard evidence.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.624
Whatever your beliefs are,
Sheriff, you better take care.

25:17.005 --> 25:20.335
There's more things in that
swamp than you'll ever understand.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.062
This is a dark corner
of the world, boy.

25:23.148 --> 25:24.945
You better keep your lights on.

25:36.383 --> 25:39.523
- Fraser.
- Yeah, go ahead, Sheriff.

25:40.226 --> 25:43.773
Fraser, I'm drivin' back from the work
site, checkin' the perimeter of the swamp.

25:43.813 --> 25:46.609
I'm losing you, Sheriff. You
be careful out there, Sheriff.

26:15.929 --> 26:16.906
Aah!

27:01.390 --> 27:02.335
Huh?

27:10.701 --> 27:11.648
Shit.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.617
This is ridiculous.

27:15.733 --> 27:17.156
Is that you, Laroque?

27:35.058 --> 27:38.328
Jake! Jake!
Where are you goin'?

27:38.593 --> 27:41.796
Did you get him?
Did you get a bead on him?

27:44.632 --> 27:46.085
Goddamn it!

27:47.015 --> 27:48.523
I ain't chasin'.

27:49.312 --> 27:51.788
Ain't no Indian
gonna make me run!

27:53.634 --> 27:54.859
No, sir.

28:29.322 --> 28:30.865
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

28:32.438 --> 28:33.835
Show me your hands!

28:45.724 --> 28:47.148
Are you Rene Laroque?

28:50.367 --> 28:51.769
Don't fucking move!

28:52.124 --> 28:53.718
I'm Sheriff Kyle Williams.

28:54.404 --> 28:56.390
I will put you down.

29:02.953 --> 29:04.550
Go home...

29:05.879 --> 29:07.460
or you will die.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.617
Shit!

29:23.165 --> 29:24.328
Jake!

29:27.336 --> 29:29.460
Quit fuckin' around, man!

29:32.842 --> 29:35.367
Get back up here
and finish your watch!

29:51.026 --> 29:52.281
God!

29:55.663 --> 29:57.015
What the...

30:29.878 --> 30:31.101
Jake!

30:32.942 --> 30:34.406
Come on, man!

30:35.154 --> 30:37.101
I'm done with fuckin' around!

31:50.952 --> 31:52.296
Oh, fuck!

32:01.578 --> 32:02.718
New sheriff,

32:04.554 --> 32:05.851
meet the old sheriff.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.749
Jim Corely.

32:08.245 --> 32:10.343
Poor guy.
There's hardly anything left of him.

32:11.906 --> 32:14.843
He's been missin' for over a
month. How'd you end up findin' him?

32:15.961 --> 32:17.617
Just lucky, I guess.

32:19.339 --> 32:20.812
Right.

32:23.279 --> 32:24.812
Notice somethin' here.

32:25.313 --> 32:26.828
See this?

32:29.265 --> 32:30.617
Right around here?

32:31.304 --> 32:33.968
Classic bite pattern of
a large mississippiensis...

32:34.042 --> 32:35.843
common southern alligator.

32:36.482 --> 32:38.442
- There's no doubt about this one.
- This one?

32:40.499 --> 32:42.210
Mind gettin' that?

32:43.694 --> 32:44.570
Please?

32:51.747 --> 32:53.156
County coroner's office.

32:54.328 --> 32:55.312
Yeah.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.437
Fraser, speak up.

33:08.226 --> 33:10.054
Clean up.
I need you on a field trip.

33:11.629 --> 33:12.585
Cool.

33:28.210 --> 33:29.820
I'll get my kit, Sheriff.

33:30.539 --> 33:31.632
Fraser.

33:35.824 --> 33:37.148
You okay?

33:40.212 --> 33:41.617
Now, you focus, Eric.

33:42.214 --> 33:44.624
- You can be freaked out later, but not on the job.
- Yeah.

34:27.409 --> 34:30.312
- What the hell could do that?
- I don't know.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.434
Could this be some kind of, um,

34:45.409 --> 34:46.934
ritualistic thing?

34:48.487 --> 34:50.145
I have no idea, Sheriff.

34:50.873 --> 34:52.559
No idea at all.

35:15.046 --> 35:18.059
How could you shove a branch
down someone's throat like that?

35:18.517 --> 35:19.996
Let me show you something.

35:23.738 --> 35:25.082
See the teeth?

35:26.348 --> 35:28.098
Position of the tongue?

35:29.395 --> 35:30.402
Sheriff,

35:30.926 --> 35:32.848
this branch
wasn't shoved in.

35:35.082 --> 35:37.645
It's comin' from the inside out.

35:40.207 --> 35:42.957
- See, the other bodies, they had...
- What other bodies?

35:46.198 --> 35:47.707
I need a cigarette.

35:50.801 --> 35:52.238
Do you have to smoke?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.293
Definitely.

35:58.652 --> 36:01.863
Sheriff, three of
our missin' persons,

36:01.934 --> 36:05.027
they-they washed up
over the past several months.

36:05.170 --> 36:07.207
Now, they all had...

36:07.733 --> 36:10.735
Well, not like this, Sheriff,
but-but more like Billy, you know?

36:11.012 --> 36:14.155
Swamp stuff growin'
inside of 'em...

36:14.156 --> 36:16.504
comin' out from inside,
you understand?

36:17.535 --> 36:19.043
Why wasn't this in the file?

36:19.427 --> 36:21.746
Corely wouldn't even let me
do an autopsy on 'em, Sheriff.

36:22.424 --> 36:25.485
I mean, he insisted
I file them as gator attacks.

36:25.582 --> 36:27.020
What did you think they were?

36:27.076 --> 36:29.356
- Hell, I-I figured, what the fuckin' else could they be?
- What the hell?

36:29.381 --> 36:30.481
Goddamn it!

36:47.988 --> 36:49.816
What man could do that?

37:06.184 --> 37:07.324
Sheriff!

37:08.645 --> 37:10.066
I just talked to Val.

37:10.746 --> 37:12.255
You're going to get
Rene, aren't you?

37:12.256 --> 37:14.137
Teri, please,
just let me do my job.

37:14.172 --> 37:16.107
What, you're gonna hunt him down
like some kind of animal?

37:16.132 --> 37:17.504
Look, if he's innocent,
then he'll walk.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.629
But I can't just sit on my hands
and watch other people die.

37:20.222 --> 37:22.621
- Rene would never do something like that.
- How do you know that?

37:23.148 --> 37:25.817
I saw Rene less than two miles from
where Steve Gerber was murdered.

37:26.746 --> 37:30.012
- Sheriff!
- You're not listening to me. I know Rene.

37:30.052 --> 37:32.316
- Yeah, well, that's pretty obvious.
- Hey, Kyle!

37:32.734 --> 37:33.613
What?

37:33.684 --> 37:36.988
Jake Schist is hirin' the
Thibodeauxs to go after Rene.

37:37.031 --> 37:39.262
Don't you see
what's goin' on here?

37:39.615 --> 37:41.582
We'd better get
over there and talk to 'em.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.660
- I'll lock up.
- Goddamn it!

38:06.412 --> 38:08.550
- You smell that?
- That's bad.

38:14.108 --> 38:15.301
Fraser.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.262
What y'all doin'
out here, Fraser?

38:18.318 --> 38:20.610
Shoppin' for somethin'
for your new girlfriend there?

38:20.643 --> 38:23.395
Well, Rodney,
your mama called my mama,

38:23.420 --> 38:26.199
and she told my mama that Jake
was out here gettin' you boys...

38:26.224 --> 38:28.270
mixed up in our investigation.

38:28.848 --> 38:29.770
Hey.

38:49.981 --> 38:52.363
Well, well, well.

38:52.770 --> 38:54.020
We in trouble?

38:54.358 --> 38:58.387
- Hell, we ain't done nothin' yet.
- Shut up, Wayne.

39:00.059 --> 39:01.848
So what brings you
to the shit shack, Jake?

39:01.893 --> 39:06.801
Hey, you want a beer?
Oh, that's right. You on duty.

39:08.941 --> 39:11.637
Old Jake here was just tellin' us
what happened to Steve Gerber.

39:12.793 --> 39:14.848
- Nasty.
- Real bad.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.051
Yeah. I'd appreciate you not
discussing the investigation--

39:18.076 --> 39:20.832
Hey, get them heads
out of the formaldehyde!

39:20.875 --> 39:23.520
Shit! I bet
you overcooked 'em.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.152
When they get overcooked,
the skin bursts.

39:27.329 --> 39:30.613
They dry all crackly-lookin'
and weird.

39:33.941 --> 39:36.402
- Fucked up?
- Nope. We're good.

39:36.444 --> 39:38.301
Well, lacquer 'em up quick.

39:38.348 --> 39:43.465
You know how them dumb
Yankee tourists likes 'em shiny.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.926
Just so there's no misunderstanding.

39:49.828 --> 39:52.645
If I see any one of you in that
swamp lookin' for Rene Laroque,

39:53.645 --> 39:55.316
I won't hesitate to
throw the book at you.

39:55.341 --> 39:56.316
Get up!

39:59.535 --> 40:02.691
Me and my brother here, we're just a couple
of good old boys tryin' to make a livin'.

40:03.434 --> 40:05.652
Ain't no need
to get unfriendly-like.

40:05.677 --> 40:07.227
Yeah, well, Mr. Thibodeaux,

40:07.672 --> 40:09.629
that's about as friendly
as I'm gonna get.

40:10.210 --> 40:11.348
Come on.

40:11.934 --> 40:13.324
Get inside!

40:16.046 --> 40:17.262
Stupid, Jake.

40:26.746 --> 40:28.645
That about
does it for the main channels.

40:28.686 --> 40:30.582
I wanna find Laroque
before anyone else does.

40:30.826 --> 40:32.231
Gettin' dark, sir.

40:33.829 --> 40:35.699
Just take me to
the deep swamp, Fraser.

40:36.388 --> 40:37.395
Okay.

42:03.981 --> 42:05.160
Shit!

42:06.395 --> 42:09.535
Perfect timing.
I hate this swamp.

42:10.484 --> 42:13.059
Sheriff, if I don't...
if I don't fix this engine,

42:13.191 --> 42:15.543
the battery will die,
and we'll lose the lights.

42:17.129 --> 42:19.691
Well, I hope
you can fix it, Fraser.

42:24.285 --> 42:27.168
Why don't they write
a manual for these things?

42:34.270 --> 42:36.254
There's
too many things alive out here.

42:36.413 --> 42:38.574
Yeah, I'd like to remain
one of 'em.

43:03.686 --> 43:05.731
Hey, where you runnin'?

43:06.229 --> 43:10.707
You always make the coffee too
strong, Wayne. My shit's boilin'.

43:10.779 --> 43:13.572
Well, get downwind
and squeeze it off.

43:13.691 --> 43:17.684
Don't wanna let Sheriff Cranky Pants
have a chance of pickin' up your stink.

43:17.951 --> 43:20.527
Believe me, it'll be quick.

43:31.298 --> 43:32.566
Ooh!

43:55.705 --> 43:57.152
Fuckin' swamp.

44:03.238 --> 44:06.051
Shit! Shit! Shit!

44:10.887 --> 44:12.449
- Hey!
- Stinkin' mud!

44:12.505 --> 44:13.481
You shat yourself.

44:15.103 --> 44:18.973
- Your whole self.
- I fell in the mud, you scrotum.

44:19.488 --> 44:21.754
Sure it
wasn't your own mud?

44:22.390 --> 44:24.766
I'm gettin' pretty goddamn
sick of your shit, Wayne.

44:24.767 --> 44:27.738
Oh, come on.
We're brothers, Rodney.

44:28.145 --> 44:31.832
- That's my job.
- Well, let's get on with this job.

44:32.465 --> 44:34.496
Let's go get us an Injun skull.

44:46.039 --> 44:47.410
Mike Ploog.

44:48.270 --> 44:49.543
Yeah, I met him.

44:50.460 --> 44:53.731
- He's a weird guy.
- Yeah, that's Ploog, all right.

44:53.789 --> 44:55.520
Moved here about six months ago.

44:55.555 --> 44:57.762
Took a place right in
the middle of the swamp.

44:58.285 --> 45:01.246
Told me he saw the Loch Ness
monster when he was a boy.

45:02.410 --> 45:03.762
So, what's at Ploog's?

45:04.035 --> 45:07.137
He's got a couple extra canoes
tied up to his porch.

45:08.392 --> 45:10.426
We'll need 'em if
we wanna get home.

45:12.148 --> 45:14.942
Or go deeper,
if that plan still stands.

45:17.077 --> 45:18.912
What are you afraid of, Fraser?

45:24.493 --> 45:26.121
The Dark Water.

45:27.816 --> 45:29.473
Sacred land, man.

45:30.051 --> 45:32.332
If I was Rene,
that's where I'd be.

45:33.127 --> 45:35.012
And I can show you to the edge,

45:36.318 --> 45:38.981
but badge or no badge,
that's as far as I'll go.

45:40.592 --> 45:42.277
You really believe in all this?

45:43.059 --> 45:46.527
I believe that when a man's
chest becomes an insect's palace,

45:46.619 --> 45:50.559
when his eyes are gone and
his limbs ain't there no more,

45:51.170 --> 45:55.535
and when I'm so scared I wanna handcuff myself
to my bed to keep from comin' to work...

45:56.192 --> 45:57.770
Yeah, I believe it, man.

45:59.861 --> 46:02.004
I believe
I don't wanna die, Sheriff.

46:11.910 --> 46:13.270
Rodney!

46:17.713 --> 46:18.910
Rodney?

46:20.613 --> 46:21.785
Rodney!

46:23.676 --> 46:25.270
I can't see ya!

46:25.637 --> 46:26.762
Wait up!

46:38.245 --> 46:39.621
Rodney!

46:46.199 --> 46:47.934
Damn! Mud bank!

46:52.746 --> 46:55.512
You'd best get your
sorry ass on back here!

46:56.939 --> 46:57.981
What's that?

47:21.550 --> 47:23.113
Rodney!

47:28.152 --> 47:29.301
Rodney!

47:40.349 --> 47:41.457
What the...

47:44.910 --> 47:47.145
Rodney!

48:42.422 --> 48:44.590
There it is.
That's Ploog's.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.637
Hey, Ploog!

48:52.246 --> 48:53.441
Mike!

48:54.715 --> 48:56.668
Mike, you there?

48:57.577 --> 48:58.785
It's Fraser.

49:17.141 --> 49:18.168
It's locked.

49:19.416 --> 49:20.941
Somethin's wrong.

49:23.112 --> 49:24.762
Don't feel right.

49:26.025 --> 49:28.238
Why don't you stay here?
You wait for Ploog.

49:28.411 --> 49:30.877
- I'll go find Rene.
- Hey, what? Wait.

49:30.902 --> 49:34.316
Fraser, I need you
to wait here...

49:35.075 --> 49:36.723
in case I flush him out.

49:37.928 --> 49:39.199
You're here to grab him.

49:40.238 --> 49:43.473
If the Thibodeauxs come by,
well, you can handle 'em.

49:45.522 --> 49:48.277
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Okay, chief.

49:50.095 --> 49:52.035
Keep your eyes open, Fraser.

49:55.511 --> 49:58.785
Yeah, it's all good, chief.
I'll be right here.

49:59.435 --> 50:00.527
Okay.

50:22.747 --> 50:24.199
Smart, Kyle.

50:32.160 --> 50:33.754
Take the Bywater job.

50:35.660 --> 50:37.309
Get a tan,

50:39.816 --> 50:41.152
beer belly,

50:43.118 --> 50:44.426
lots of sun.

50:45.976 --> 50:47.645
Get fuckin' eaten alive.

50:58.700 --> 51:00.606
Rene!

51:10.059 --> 51:11.332
Wayne!

51:11.910 --> 51:13.324
Goddamn it!

51:13.677 --> 51:17.246
Make me turn my ass around and come
back all this way just to look for you.

51:18.059 --> 51:20.926
Son of a bitch. Wayne!

51:24.787 --> 51:26.441
Wayne, where you at?

51:29.569 --> 51:32.277
Wayne? Is that you?

51:43.986 --> 51:46.074
Oh, Jesus! Lord!

51:49.445 --> 51:51.770
No, Wayne! No!

51:53.066 --> 51:57.512
Oh, Wayne, what the hell
happened to you?

52:13.152 --> 52:14.395
Hey, Mike!

52:14.772 --> 52:16.418
Mike Ploog, is that you?

52:16.949 --> 52:18.551
It's Deputy Fraser.

52:19.588 --> 52:22.691
Now, no goddamn sneaking up,
ya hear?

52:39.731 --> 52:41.270
Hey, Ploog!

52:52.934 --> 52:54.246
Mike!

52:55.554 --> 52:56.691
Wait up!

53:31.692 --> 53:33.199
Rene!

53:35.822 --> 53:37.535
It's Sheriff Williams.

53:40.937 --> 53:42.434
I just wanna talk.

53:44.120 --> 53:47.379
There's a couple of rednecks out
here who want to do a lot more than that.

53:50.265 --> 53:51.316
Rene,

53:51.919 --> 53:54.598
I wanna talk about
what happened to Ted Sallis.

54:26.856 --> 54:27.891
Rene.

54:29.351 --> 54:30.754
What are you doing?

54:40.958 --> 54:42.723
Joining the hunt, Sheriff.

55:06.934 --> 55:07.910
Mike?

55:10.741 --> 55:12.660
Is somebody there? Hello?

55:17.644 --> 55:19.496
Didn't I tell you to go home?

55:20.699 --> 55:22.895
If you're not who they say
you are, just cut me down.

55:23.606 --> 55:25.020
Who do they say I am?

55:26.011 --> 55:28.863
They say you're the one
responsible for people disappearing.

55:29.426 --> 55:31.504
- No.
- Then who is?

55:31.871 --> 55:33.746
Only the swamp
knows the answer to that.

55:34.082 --> 55:36.488
- Not everyone's against you, Rene.
- Oh, yeah?

55:36.996 --> 55:38.645
There are some people
who believe you're innocent.

55:38.709 --> 55:42.336
No one is innocent, Sheriff,
especially not me.

55:43.715 --> 55:47.145
I convinced Schist to buy up all
the Indian land... the swampland.

55:47.409 --> 55:48.738
So you sold out.

55:50.363 --> 55:51.512
We had nothing.

55:52.941 --> 55:54.582
I thought the money
would help the tribe.

55:55.520 --> 55:56.606
What went wrong?

55:56.664 --> 56:00.199
- Ted Sallis wouldn't sell.
- I thought he did sell.

56:03.035 --> 56:04.981
That man
would never have sold his land,

56:05.199 --> 56:07.113
and he would never have run.

56:07.801 --> 56:09.465
Are you saying Ted Sallis
was murdered?

56:09.977 --> 56:12.004
I'm saying right after
he disappeared,

56:12.037 --> 56:16.488
Schist stuck a rig in the center of
our most sacred place, the Dark Water.

56:17.025 --> 56:19.981
The guardian here won't stop
until the flow of oil has stopped.

56:20.021 --> 56:23.160
- Pete Horn said something was out here.
- We never once saw eye to eye.

56:23.213 --> 56:26.816
But Pete thinks his prayers can stop it.
I've got my own plans.

56:36.982 --> 56:38.699
Run, or it'll kill you!

56:41.291 --> 56:44.098
Rene! Rene, wait!

56:52.091 --> 56:53.215
Rene!

56:55.428 --> 56:57.652
Hey, Kyle, is that you?

57:03.270 --> 57:05.465
- Kyle, over here!
- Fraser!

57:05.606 --> 57:08.606
Oh, man, it's good to see you.
Listen... Jesus!

57:09.504 --> 57:10.691
Fraser!

57:59.731 --> 58:04.166
- What the heck are you doing, you sick bastard?
- Jesus! I'm taking pictures, man! I'm a photographer!

58:04.206 --> 58:06.652
Yeah, of my deputy's goddamn arm, you asshole!

58:06.677 --> 58:08.956
Look, I was tracking the thing
through the swamp, okay?

58:08.981 --> 58:12.104
Like I've been doing for months.
This time I got so close.

58:12.163 --> 58:13.666
What did you do to my deputy?

58:13.690 --> 58:15.233
- Where's the rest of him?
- I don't know!

58:15.258 --> 58:17.799
- I found his arm floating there!
- Shut up!

58:18.208 --> 58:20.698
Listen to me. I spent a whole year in
Canada trying to get a shot of Bigfoot,

58:20.723 --> 58:24.331
and then I was a year in Nevada trying
to get that shit happening at Area 51.

58:24.356 --> 58:26.002
I got zip, man! Nothin'!

58:26.147 --> 58:30.932
But what I got tonight... tonight,
man, will streak your shorts.

58:31.135 --> 58:34.502
Come on. We'll go back to my
shack, man. I'll show you the pictures.

58:35.362 --> 58:37.323
- Fuck me.
- Hey, you know what?

58:37.576 --> 58:40.682
That thing's probably sniffing
us out as we speak, Sheriff.

58:42.755 --> 58:43.987
You show me.

58:58.717 --> 58:59.924
Check this out, man.

59:01.323 --> 59:02.260
Huh?

59:02.310 --> 59:04.759
What is this? A picture
of Bywater at night?

59:04.784 --> 59:07.002
Look closer, Sheriff.
Look closer.

59:08.057 --> 59:10.329
Who killed Fraser, Ploog?
Fuck these pictures!

59:10.354 --> 59:12.151
Sheriff, take a closer look.

59:12.342 --> 59:15.815
Come on. You'll see it. It's
like the nature of fear, man.

59:27.510 --> 59:28.721
No, it's a trick.

59:29.916 --> 59:31.065
It's not possible.

59:31.370 --> 59:32.354
What?

59:32.627 --> 59:34.823
I don't believe it.
What is that?

59:35.643 --> 59:37.940
- That's a man.
- Oh, yeah, that's a man, all right, huh?

59:38.135 --> 59:39.768
It's the Man-thing, man!

59:40.068 --> 59:42.221
All right. Look.
All right. It's not perfect.

59:42.302 --> 59:44.845
I understand that. But look
at that. Look at that thing!

59:44.954 --> 59:47.331
Pack up your things. You're
coming with me. It's all evidence now.

59:47.383 --> 59:48.706
- What?
- Everything. Pack it all up.

59:48.737 --> 59:50.118
- You're coming with me.
- No. I can't leave here.

59:50.143 --> 59:52.948
You pack up your photos, all your crap.
Pack it up now.

59:52.973 --> 59:56.284
You're coming with me, or I'm gonna cuff
you and drag you out of here on your ass.

59:57.924 --> 59:58.979
Now!

01:00:01.643 --> 01:00:03.026
Don't run, kids.

01:00:12.602 --> 01:00:15.862
Something is out there...
waiting.

01:00:20.923 --> 01:00:21.971
Teri.

01:00:31.745 --> 01:00:32.694
Hi.

01:00:33.581 --> 01:00:34.823
Is everything all right?

01:00:35.155 --> 01:00:37.104
Fraser was killed last night
in the swamp.

01:00:39.633 --> 01:00:41.620
I need you to take me
to Pete Horn.

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:47.963
It was something he said.
Uh, I think he can help me.

01:00:49.135 --> 01:00:50.561
Okay, to Pete.
Uh...

01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:52.651
just give me a second,
all right?

01:00:52.676 --> 01:00:54.518
Kera, I need to talk with you.

01:01:19.495 --> 01:01:21.987
Park here at the dump.
We have to walk in.

01:01:29.643 --> 01:01:32.182
- Hey, Mary, we're just here to see Pete.
- Hey, Teri.

01:01:35.134 --> 01:01:38.041
- This is it.
- You finished with them oysters?

01:01:44.772 --> 01:01:45.866
Pete?

01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:47.987
Pete, it's Teri.

01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:50.362
Hi.

01:01:53.674 --> 01:01:56.198
Please sit. I made tea.

01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:58.471
- Thank you, Pete.
- How'd you know we'd be here?

01:01:59.463 --> 01:02:00.659
It's good tea.

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:17.823
Pete, I need to ask you some
questions about Rene Laroque.

01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:21.401
He told me he doesn't believe
Ted Sallis sold that land.

01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:25.017
Not many who knew Ted do.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.198
What about you?

01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:30.831
Ted Sallis was my elder.

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.885
He knew this land was sacred.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:36.791
When Schist took it,

01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:39.956
drove his pumps into it,

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.807
ran his pipes through it,

01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:46.104
it was the end.

01:02:47.206 --> 01:02:49.565
Our stories will die with me.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.245
Hey, come on.
Pete, listen to me.

01:02:57.502 --> 01:02:59.698
You're not dying anytime soon.

01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:05.057
Do you remember when I took you
to the Dark Water as a child, Teri?

01:03:06.096 --> 01:03:07.940
I remember I was scared.

01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:10.057
Yes.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.940
It is full of magic,

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:16.112
both light...

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.588
and dark.

01:03:28.244 --> 01:03:30.573
Our most powerful
guardian spirit...

01:03:30.651 --> 01:03:32.487
lives in the Dark Water.

01:03:36.857 --> 01:03:42.737
It protects what our ancestors
called the "nexus of all realities."

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:48.713
The guardian has become
very angry.

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:59.307
For the blood spilled,
it seeks blood.

01:04:09.534 --> 01:04:10.733
Pete,

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.198
I'm a cop.

01:04:14.487 --> 01:04:16.581
I can't believe
in Indian spirits and magic.

01:04:17.823 --> 01:04:19.682
What you believe doesn't matter.

01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:22.463
You're not from this place.

01:04:23.396 --> 01:04:25.174
You're not from any place.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:29.190
Where's Ted Sallis, Pete?

01:04:31.112 --> 01:04:33.104
- Is he the one killing people?
- Kyle, wait!

01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:35.190
Is he killing people
with or without Rene?

01:04:35.215 --> 01:04:40.026
- Kyle, I didn't bring you here to do this.
- Maybe he is in the swamp.

01:04:41.015 --> 01:04:43.456
Maybe the swamp is in him.

01:04:44.752 --> 01:04:47.182
Whoever or whatever
is out there, Pete,

01:04:47.916 --> 01:04:49.065
I saw it.

01:04:49.399 --> 01:04:50.698
What did you see?

01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:53.853
I don't know.

01:04:54.085 --> 01:04:55.752
You know what you saw.

01:04:58.893 --> 01:05:01.698
- It has chosen who will die.
- Who?

01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:03.487
Who will die, Pete?

01:05:05.372 --> 01:05:06.541
Everyone.

01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:11.901
Hey.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:16.268
Hey, Pete. Pete, come
on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:05:16.643 --> 01:05:17.854
Sit down, okay?

01:05:19.354 --> 01:05:21.252
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:24.112
I'm tired.

01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:27.229
- Please go now.
- Yeah.

01:05:31.293 --> 01:05:32.495
Just rest.

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:46.932
Kyle!

01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:48.799
You didn't
have to do that.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.479
He's an old man, for God's sake.

01:05:50.504 --> 01:05:52.471
He's an old man who knows
what the hell's going on.

01:05:52.647 --> 01:05:54.924
Listen to yourself.
What are you saying?

01:05:54.980 --> 01:06:00.338
Listen, Teri. Last night, I saw something
rip apart Fraser like a fucking puppet.

01:06:01.182 --> 01:06:04.862
Look, I've gotta go out in that swamp
and stop whatever's killing people.

01:06:05.877 --> 01:06:07.729
It's my fault
Fraser's dead, Teri.

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:10.065
And I don't know if
I can protect you.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.549
Hey, Kyle.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.354
None of this is your fault.

01:06:53.863 --> 01:06:58.479
Aren't you supposed to be investigating a
murder instead of our educational system?

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:02.674
What is your exact
connection with Rene Laroque?

01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:04.245
He worked for me.

01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:06.870
Most of the people
around here do.

01:07:07.451 --> 01:07:08.487
So?

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:12.580
What?

01:07:16.947 --> 01:07:19.760
- Does she taste as good as she looks?
- Fuck you.

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:23.893
Listen, my deputy's dead.

01:07:24.276 --> 01:07:26.666
I think you're lying, Schist,
and I'm calling in the F.B.I.

01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:28.530
I can't believe this.

01:07:29.284 --> 01:07:30.674
Are you threatening me?

01:07:31.487 --> 01:07:34.416
Consider yourself relieved
of your duty, Sheriff.

01:07:34.832 --> 01:07:37.502
Yeah. I take my orders from
the county. I am the county!

01:07:38.174 --> 01:07:40.026
We'll have this sorted out
by the morning.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:42.198
Well, until then,
you stay the fuck out of my way.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.674
That goes for you too, dipshit.

01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:47.291
God, Pa! Damn!

01:07:47.316 --> 01:07:49.985
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:51.260
See ya.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.065
Just what is it...

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:56.737
you think you know?

01:07:57.971 --> 01:08:00.049
You know nothing about Bywater.

01:08:00.795 --> 01:08:02.518
This town was nothing before me.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:05.440
Nobody's gonna
muscle me out of it.

01:08:05.877 --> 01:08:08.760
Not the F.B.I.
or Rene Laroque,

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:10.768
and certainly not...

01:08:11.985 --> 01:08:14.963
some two-bit
Yankee cocksucker...

01:08:16.261 --> 01:08:17.962
with a badge.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.956
Fuck you!

01:08:40.376 --> 01:08:42.064
What happened
with the Thibodeauxs?

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.932
- They didn't come back this morning.
- Damn it, Jake!

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:47.625
- You were supposed to go with them!
- I was only trying to make sure...

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:50.568
Oh, yes. "I was only trying... I'm
always trying and never doing."

01:08:50.654 --> 01:08:52.033
That's your problem.

01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:55.345
Goddamn, if you learn
nothing from me, you learn this:

01:08:55.424 --> 01:08:58.002
You want something done in life,
you gotta do it yourself,

01:08:58.209 --> 01:09:00.776
'cause you cannot rely
on anybody.

01:09:01.674 --> 01:09:03.198
Not even your own son.

01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:05.612
What are we gonna do
about this, then?

01:09:07.871 --> 01:09:09.666
We're gonna finish it.

01:09:11.057 --> 01:09:12.139
Tonight.

01:09:13.807 --> 01:09:15.979
I want
that Laroque dead.

01:09:16.104 --> 01:09:17.256
What about...

01:09:18.323 --> 01:09:20.033
Dudley Do-Right?

01:09:20.799 --> 01:09:22.206
He keeps on digging.

01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:24.182
We'll let him dig.

01:09:25.337 --> 01:09:27.783
It's his own grave he's digging.

01:09:49.093 --> 01:09:50.908
Give me the strength.

01:09:52.198 --> 01:09:54.635
The killing ends tonight.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.752
Kyle, I think you
should call the F.B.I.

01:10:24.397 --> 01:10:25.924
The bureau
could take days, Teri.

01:10:26.695 --> 01:10:28.495
Schist is gonna go after
Rene tonight.

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:32.432
Listen to me. I've been running
around in that swamp since I was a kid.

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.979
I can help you.

01:10:34.004 --> 01:10:36.534
You can help me by staying away
from that swamp until all this is over.

01:10:36.757 --> 01:10:39.151
That swamp can play tricks
on your mind.

01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:41.620
Especially at night.
You don't have to do this.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:42.987
Teri, listen, please.

01:10:43.602 --> 01:10:46.229
Look, Jake could be out there...
Schist, Rene.

01:10:47.419 --> 01:10:48.893
God knows what else.

01:10:52.379 --> 01:10:54.018
Can you promise me, please?

01:10:55.153 --> 01:10:56.737
Just don't go into that swamp.

01:11:02.249 --> 01:11:04.088
I'll be here when you get back.

01:11:05.954 --> 01:11:07.588
And you better get back.

01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:11.838
Okay?

01:12:45.002 --> 01:12:46.159
Schist.

01:12:46.938 --> 01:12:48.581
Pa, I think I hear something.

01:14:00.133 --> 01:14:01.534
I know you.

01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:06.362
I know you, and I am not afraid.

01:14:07.104 --> 01:14:09.416
Take my life and be done.

01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:53.299
Sheriff's office.

01:14:53.324 --> 01:14:55.127
Yeah, it's the
coroner. Is the sheriff in?

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:57.307
- Val? It's Teri.
- Yeah.

01:14:57.332 --> 01:15:00.479
- Teri, is he in? It's kind of urgent.
- He's not here right now.

01:15:00.646 --> 01:15:02.581
I could get him a message.
What's up?

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.768
I guess you could say
Corely died of unnatural causes.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.487
I pulled a bullet
out of his spine.

01:15:08.928 --> 01:15:11.948
- A bullet?
- Tell Kyle it was at close range.

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:14.612
A semiautomatic handgun, .45.

01:15:14.768 --> 01:15:17.002
I think Sheriff Corely
knew who killed him.

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:19.807
- Where is Kyle?
- He's out in the swamp.

01:15:43.893 --> 01:15:46.047
Heel! Heel! Heel!

01:15:46.048 --> 01:15:48.838
- Get your fucking dogs off me!
- I got 'em, man.

01:15:49.087 --> 01:15:51.885
Ploog, I told you to stay
in fucking town!

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.096
Can you smell that, Sheriff?

01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:00.463
It's the perfume of my future.

01:16:00.662 --> 01:16:03.807
Point, click, fame.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:07.807
There it is! Gotta go.
Good luck out there, man!

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.916
- I think it's the cover of Life magazine, man!
- Life magazine!?

01:16:12.325 --> 01:16:14.995
Life magazine went out of
business, you fucking idiot!

01:16:44.659 --> 01:16:45.823
Jake?

01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:47.745
Jake!

01:17:04.868 --> 01:17:07.448
Damned if you take
my picture, asshole.

01:17:14.577 --> 01:17:16.104
Pa!

01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:09.823
Kyle!

01:19:21.143 --> 01:19:22.658
Schist.

01:20:24.294 --> 01:20:26.255
- Kyle!
- Jesus!

01:20:26.513 --> 01:20:28.013
Teri, I almost shot you.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.966
Oh, thank God!

01:20:32.513 --> 01:20:34.791
I had to find you.
Corely was murdered.

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.818
Val found a slug from a .45
in his spine.

01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:39.872
Listen, Teri,
I just found Ploog.

01:20:41.294 --> 01:20:43.427
- He's dead. He was shot.
- Jesus.

01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:45.607
I don't think Ted Sallis
ran away with that money.

01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:48.575
I think Schist killed him for this land.
Corely knew about it, so he got a bullet.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.529
- He's trying to blame it on Rene?
- Rene's the last one that knows the truth.

01:20:51.554 --> 01:20:54.169
You'll never find Rene without me.
I'm leading you to the Dark Water.

01:20:54.505 --> 01:20:57.466
- That's where he's been hiding out, and I think...
- You've known this all along?

01:20:58.786 --> 01:21:01.224
- I knew he was innocent.
- Aw, Jesus, Teri.

01:21:01.271 --> 01:21:04.405
You'll never find the Dark Water
without me. Okay?

01:21:05.436 --> 01:21:06.505
Okay.

01:21:08.254 --> 01:21:09.474
Just keep up.

01:21:20.052 --> 01:21:22.372
- Are you sure you know where you're going?
- Yeah.

01:21:22.435 --> 01:21:23.786
Down here, I think.

01:21:24.286 --> 01:21:26.294
Yeah, I've been thinking
about what Pete said.

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:29.138
- I think he might be right.
- About what?

01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:30.521
Oh, shit!

01:21:31.724 --> 01:21:32.872
About that.

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.388
This way. Come on.

01:21:41.825 --> 01:21:43.263
Oh, fuck.

01:21:46.656 --> 01:21:47.700
Step.

01:22:37.914 --> 01:22:39.685
Stop right there, Rene!

01:22:46.368 --> 01:22:47.849
I'm begging you.

01:22:48.834 --> 01:22:51.521
I'm just aching for an excuse.

01:23:13.172 --> 01:23:14.474
It doesn't matter.

01:23:15.337 --> 01:23:16.904
The swamp will have you.

01:23:19.154 --> 01:23:20.325
This way!

01:23:22.185 --> 01:23:24.740
This is it. This is the last
stretch before the Dark Water.

01:23:24.772 --> 01:23:26.490
You can't see a thing in here.

01:23:27.786 --> 01:23:28.825
Oh, shit!

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:30.974
God, what is that?

01:23:32.786 --> 01:23:33.935
Teri, go!

01:23:39.526 --> 01:23:41.654
Go, Teri, go!
Just keep moving!

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:50.740
Jesus!

01:23:57.146 --> 01:23:58.427
Do you see anything, Teri?

01:23:59.161 --> 01:24:01.271
Kyle, I think there's
something in the water!

01:24:03.009 --> 01:24:04.841
Oh, what's that?

01:24:05.552 --> 01:24:08.646
Go! Move!
This thing is behind us!

01:24:08.671 --> 01:24:11.935
- Kyle, I can't see anything!
- I'm here.

01:24:19.919 --> 01:24:20.955
How much further?

01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:23.911
- How much further?
- I don't know.

01:24:25.914 --> 01:24:27.771
Quick! Go!

01:24:30.904 --> 01:24:35.739
You don't scare me
with that hocus-pocus, boy.

01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:38.865
You're friend, Ted Sallis,

01:24:39.119 --> 01:24:40.861
before he died,

01:24:42.232 --> 01:24:44.911
before I buried him
here under this rig,

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:48.700
you know what he said?

01:24:48.896 --> 01:24:50.247
Fuck you!

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:53.004
He said I was setting him free.

01:24:56.544 --> 01:24:57.919
How about you?

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.747
You all wanna be free, Rene?

01:25:00.806 --> 01:25:03.286
It's not as dark up
ahead. I can see a clearing.

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:05.700
- Quiet.
- I think it's this way.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.247
- No.
- There. I can see it.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.865
Oh, God! Oh! Rene?

01:25:19.518 --> 01:25:21.357
Okay, we gotta get
the fuck out of here!

01:25:22.327 --> 01:25:24.450
Rene, what are you doing?

01:25:27.105 --> 01:25:28.411
I'm sorry, Teri.

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:30.443
I'm sorry.

01:25:31.985 --> 01:25:34.208
My sin put this here.

01:25:35.216 --> 01:25:37.357
It's my penance to take it down.

01:25:37.953 --> 01:25:39.130
Freeze!

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:41.499
No!

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.536
- God!
- Pass me the gun, girl!

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.771
- You don't understand! Something's chasing us!
- Give me the gun!

01:25:55.068 --> 01:25:57.607
You're a murderer, Schist.

01:25:58.572 --> 01:26:01.950
You should have kept your
Yankee nose out of this, boy!

01:26:02.622 --> 01:26:04.700
- You're gonna die.
- Yeah!

01:26:04.725 --> 01:26:08.232
And I suppose you're
gonna kill me!

01:26:09.888 --> 01:26:10.833
No...

01:26:11.419 --> 01:26:12.794
He is.

01:26:13.505 --> 01:26:14.825
Jake?

01:27:27.628 --> 01:27:29.386
Oh, shit!

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:32.253
Here it comes.

01:27:35.891 --> 01:27:37.516
Rene, watch out!

01:28:03.009 --> 01:28:04.204
Teri!

01:28:07.239 --> 01:28:08.168
Run!

01:28:09.642 --> 01:28:11.239
I'll set you free!

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:14.332
Teri, move!

01:28:17.654 --> 01:28:20.168
- Get down!
- Now, Teri!
