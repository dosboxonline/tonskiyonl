00:41.166 --> 00:43.668
So, there's this thing called AvengerCon.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.712
It's, like, the first fan event

00:46.004 --> 00:50.008
celebrating our great heroes of our time
and it's totally historic,

00:50.216 --> 00:51.593
and it's, like, very educational.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.804
So you want to go to a party, at night?

00:56.181 --> 00:58.892
It's not a party, it's a convention.

00:59.309 --> 01:03.354
-How exactly will you be dressed?
-KAMALA: As Captain Marvel.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.356
Huh?

01:05.440 --> 01:08.777
-Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel.
-Captain Marvel. Astaghfirullah.

(CROWD CHEERING)

01:12.447 --> 01:13.448
I'm 16.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.660
Look, I promise
I won't do anything stupid.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.626
Let's be honest.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.670
It's not really the brown girls
from Jersey City who save the world.

01:31.132 --> 01:35.261
I wish that you would just focus on you.

01:36.387 --> 01:39.307
Your teachers, they're telling me
you're doodling all day,

01:39.390 --> 01:42.519
staring off into space
in your little fantasy land.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.604
Hey. Oh, really?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.982
Who do you want to be in this world?

01:49.025 --> 01:50.360
Do you want to be good...

01:50.610 --> 01:52.529
-I'm Kamran.
-Kamala.

01:52.612 --> 01:57.075
...or do you want to be
this cosmic head-in-the-clouds person?

01:57.992 --> 01:59.077
Cosmic.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.328
Whoo!

02:01.162 --> 02:03.873
BRUNO: So it looks like your power
isn't coming from the bangle.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.959
It's coming from within you.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.295
Like the bangle
unlocked the superhuman part of you.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.631
Someone help me! Please!

02:12.257 --> 02:15.009
-It's Night Light.
-I've never seen powers like that.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.013
(CROWD GASPING)

02:22.016 --> 02:23.351
Yeah. Bring her in.

community center and mosque.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.150
Hold it right where you are!

02:35.488 --> 02:36.656
-Get in!
-Kamran.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.242
I'd like you to meet my mom.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.245
I've been waiting
a very long time to meet you.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.958
That bangle brought you to me.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.670
That bangle belonged to my mother, Aisha.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.214
KAMALA: Do you know what happened
to our great grandma? Aisha?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.008
The one who disappeared during Partition?

02:55.425 --> 02:58.511
That woman brought shame
on our entire family.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.098
Aisha was from another dimension,
and so are we.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.477
What we're most commonly known as
is Djinn.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.148
-I'm a Djinn.
-And tonic?

"Some call them genies. Others, demons."

NAJMA: It was Aisha's wish
to bring us all home.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.287
So you want my bangle?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.873
Apparently it might be dangerous
if we don't do it right.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.750
Of course it's dangerous.
Why wouldn't it be?

KAMRAN: You're in danger,
and so is your entire family.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.965
-I've come here to warn you.
-I'll distract them.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.259
Why are you doing this?
You said you would protect me.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.720
Why should I protect those who betray me?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.103
SANA: Did you see the train, beta?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.440
-How did you know about that?
-Because I saw it too.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.150
You have to come to Karachi.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.113
Kamala. Oh.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.365
-Munee.
-Hi, Mommy.

04:04.535 --> 04:08.581
This is my ammi, Aisha.
What I could remember of her, at least.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.833
WALEED: Your great-grandmother's story
is of legend.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.293
We have much to discuss.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.755
Every Pakistani family
has a Partition story.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.134
Back then, there was no Pakistan.
It was all one big country, India.

04:20.218 --> 04:24.264
During the Partition, Muneeba's family
had to get on to the last train

04:24.347 --> 04:26.099
that was getting out of the city.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.059
SANA: I somehow got separated
from my father.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.104
Until a trail of stars appeared.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.231
BOTH: She followed a trail of stars...

04:33.314 --> 04:34.482
Right back to her father.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.403
Nani, is it the same train?
That train from that night.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.572
SANA: The bangle is trying
to tell you something, beta.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.660
-Do you know what it says?
-It says, "What you seek is seeking you."

all these amazing things

05:48.639 --> 05:51.142
doesn't mean that you'll go
looking for trouble, right?

by and do nothing when I can help people.
