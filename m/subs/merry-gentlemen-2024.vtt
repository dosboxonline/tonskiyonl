and squeeze you in person.

12:09.291 --> 12:12.208
I cannot believe
you bought the Little Spoon.

12:12.291 --> 12:15.166
Well, Beth was retiring,
and I just could not let this place

12:15.250 --> 12:18.166
turn into one of those coffee shops
that sell $8 lattes.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.291
[Ashley] Mm.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.291
And now I can, you know,
try out my cookie recipes,

12:22.375 --> 12:24.041
chat with the customers.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.791
Two of your favorite things, babe.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.083
- Rodger!
- Hey. [chuckles]

12:28.166 --> 12:29.250
You're working here?

12:29.333 --> 12:32.833
Yeah. Helping out when I can.
Lending a little celebrity cachet.

12:32.916 --> 12:36.500
Oh, remind me. What's the statute
of limitations on high school athletics?

12:36.583 --> 12:40.333
[laughs] Okay. Okay, I admit
the old tight end isn't so tight anymore.

12:40.416 --> 12:41.250
[chuckles]

12:41.333 --> 12:42.791
- Good to see you.
- You too.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.375
Mom told me about the Belles.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.291
Oh.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.833
- I am so sorry.
- Well…

12:48.916 --> 12:49.875
[Marie sighs]

12:51.250 --> 12:54.333
Well, my whole life just got demolished

12:54.416 --> 12:56.833
by a younger dancer with perkier boobs.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.875
Well, I, for one, am so glad you're back.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.166
And you're welcome to stay with us
as long as you need.

13:02.250 --> 13:05.000
No, no, no. Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.750
What can I get you?

13:07.333 --> 13:10.333
The lady will have
a double cheeseburger with extra bacon.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.458
- Okay.
- Actually, the lady will have a salad.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.541
Okay.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.625
And an order
of my chocolate candy cane cookies.

13:18.166 --> 13:22.458
So, what's this about the Rhythm Room
having trouble booking acts?

13:22.541 --> 13:25.333
Look, a band can get more attention
with a 30-second TikTok

13:25.416 --> 13:27.000
than they can playing the Rhythm Room.

13:27.083 --> 13:27.916
Ugh.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.875
It's gonna be fine.
Mom and Dad are gonna figure it out.

13:31.708 --> 13:32.541
Probably.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.125
[Ashley] Ah!

13:34.208 --> 13:36.833
- Okay, be honest.
- Okay.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.291
[door chimes]

13:38.375 --> 13:39.833
- [Luke] City girl!
- [gasps]

13:41.000 --> 13:41.833
[muffled] Oh, my God.

13:43.458 --> 13:44.833
Uh, hey, Rog.

13:44.916 --> 13:47.041
- I'm, uh, here to get my order, and, uh…
- Yeah.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.041
I'll have what she's having.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.291
[chuckles]

13:51.333 --> 13:54.416
Uh, Luke, you live
pretty close to South Peak, yeah?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.125
- No!
- Yeah.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.125
Would you mind
just giving my sister a ride home?

13:59.208 --> 14:00.875
- Rodger and I need to close.
- [Ashley] No.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.166
I can just use a, um, rideshare app.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.791
You do know this is Sycamore Creek, right?

14:07.666 --> 14:09.250
Okay, but I haven't even eaten yet.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.291
Okay. Here we go.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.375
Wow. Such good cookies. Okay.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.625
Thanks, buddy.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.500
Watch out for the guard dog.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.500
How could I forget?

14:21.583 --> 14:24.208
Come on, city girl. Your chariot awaits.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.875
You know, you got a little, uh…

14:28.750 --> 14:29.750
[door chimes]

14:29.833 --> 14:32.666
[country music playing on radio]

14:33.916 --> 14:36.083
[sighs] Thanks. So

14:37.333 --> 14:40.250
how long have you been, um, carpentering?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.416
Don't think I've ever
heard that term before.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.541
No.

14:45.625 --> 14:46.500
I like it.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.791
My father was a general contractor,

14:49.875 --> 14:52.166
so I practically grew up in a toolbox.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.500
- Hmm.
- What about you?

14:53.583 --> 14:56.666
Oh, no, I'm more of
a call-the-building-super kind of gal.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.208
I mean, for work.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.958
Oh. Um, I'm a dancer.

15:03.791 --> 15:04.791
Oh.

15:05.666 --> 15:06.500
Okay.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.833
No, not that kind of dancer.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.875
Uh, Broadway. [chuckles]

15:10.958 --> 15:12.041
Oh.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.125
So you're a diva.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.125
What? No, I am a Jingle Belle.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.083
So you're an impressive diva.

15:18.166 --> 15:19.750
[scoffs, chuckles]

15:19.833 --> 15:24.416
To be honest,
I am currently on an indefinite hiatus.

15:25.541 --> 15:26.708
I'm sorry to hear that.

15:26.791 --> 15:27.708
Yeah.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.916
But enough about me.
What about you, Mr. Toolbox?

15:32.500 --> 15:35.375
I wanna know.
Why have you been helping my parents?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.041
That's easy.

15:37.708 --> 15:40.166
When I first moved here,
I didn't know very many people.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.375
But I loved going to the Rhythm Room.

15:42.458 --> 15:43.666
So much fun.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.375
And your folks,
they always went out of their way

15:46.458 --> 15:47.833
to make me feel at home.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.541
Yeah. Sounds like them.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.583
All right, just-- oh.

16:00.666 --> 16:01.625
Hey.

16:02.208 --> 16:05.125
- All right, don't forget this.
- Yep. Thank you. I got it.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.250
[Luke] Okay.

16:06.833 --> 16:07.666
And this.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.083
[laughs]

16:10.541 --> 16:11.875
And your salad.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.375
All right. [exhales]

16:14.375 --> 16:16.333
Um, thanks for the ride.

16:16.916 --> 16:17.875
No problem.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.375
[sighs] Guess I'll see you around.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.083
For sure.

16:23.541 --> 16:24.375
Good night.

16:24.958 --> 16:25.791
Night.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.833
[whispers] What was that?

16:30.916 --> 16:32.083
[engine turns over]

16:32.750 --> 16:33.666
[chuckles]

16:39.583 --> 16:41.375
- [dog barks]
- Gizmo!

16:41.458 --> 16:43.125
My scary little guard dog.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.583
Oh, yes.

16:44.666 --> 16:46.750
- You are so fierce, aren't you?
- [Gizmo whimpers]

16:46.833 --> 16:49.458
Okay. Let's go find Auntie Ashley's room.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.500
You kept all these?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.208
Of course I did.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.541
You're my sister.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.208
I'm so proud of you.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.875
Sometimes I think
Mom and Dad would have preferred if I just

17:07.958 --> 17:09.416
performed at the Rhythm Room.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.333
[Gizmo whimpers]

17:10.416 --> 17:15.041
I think they would have preferred if
you came to visit every once in a while.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.666
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [chuckles]

17:16.750 --> 17:19.083
But you gotta do what you gotta do, right?

17:19.166 --> 17:20.541
- [Gizmo whimpers]
- Yeah.

17:20.625 --> 17:24.083
Speaking of, um… how's Luke?

17:24.958 --> 17:26.375
News flash.

17:26.458 --> 17:30.166
Women no longer need a male companion
to solidify their happiness.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.416
- We can also vote now.
- Oh, congrats.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.333
Mm-hmm.

17:33.416 --> 17:36.833
I'm so sorry that I just
want my baby sister to be happy.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.625
I <i>was </i>happy.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.166
You know, the show
was more than just a job.

17:41.250 --> 17:45.416
It was, you know,
strength training, flexibility training,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.416
blocking, choreography,
not to mention performing every night,

17:48.500 --> 17:49.375
twice on weekends.

17:49.458 --> 17:52.125
I… I didn't even have time
to think about dating.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.458
Well, now you do.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.541
Yes, yes. That was my first thought
when they canned me.

17:57.625 --> 18:01.083
[chuckles] Well, what about in the show?

18:01.583 --> 18:02.833
Are there any cute guys?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.250
No. No showbiz guys.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.083
I want, like, a professional, you know?

18:09.166 --> 18:12.041
Like, remember the surgeon
you dated before Rodger?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.791
[laughing]

18:13.875 --> 18:15.500
What's so funny?

18:15.583 --> 18:16.583
Okay.

18:19.875 --> 18:23.625
I'm gonna tell you something, but you
gotta promise to never tell anybody.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.000
Okay, what?

18:27.791 --> 18:31.500
Max wasn't exactly a real doctor.

18:32.208 --> 18:35.208
He just played one
at bachelorette parties.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.583
- [Ashley gasps]
- [snickers]

18:39.666 --> 18:42.791
Marie Rose Davis, did you date a stripper?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.250
Shh! Shh.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.541
You dated a stripper?

18:45.625 --> 18:49.041
Well, not-- you know,
he was a doctor stripper.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.541
- It's different.
- Sure. Yeah, I mean…

18:51.625 --> 18:54.041
I know, it was
very, very off-brand for me.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.208
I am impressed.

18:55.291 --> 18:56.750
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.291
Okay, but you gotta promise
this stays in the vault.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.791
Oh, yes. Vaulted for life.

19:00.875 --> 19:01.791
Okay.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.500
- What's vaulted for life?
- [Marie] Uh…

19:04.375 --> 19:05.958
Oh, um, I don't…

19:06.041 --> 19:08.250
I think… [splutters]

19:08.333 --> 19:10.000
Ash, what was-- what are we talking about?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.791
You know, I-- I-- I do know,

19:12.875 --> 19:16.208
and I can't tell you because it's--
it's medical, and that's confidential.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.541
Mm. Yeah. [chuckles]

19:17.625 --> 19:18.458
Um…

19:19.291 --> 19:20.125
Right.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.166
[chuckles]

19:21.958 --> 19:22.833
Okay.

19:29.916 --> 19:30.958
Mom?

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
Dad?

19:35.625 --> 19:36.625
What's…

19:41.250 --> 19:42.875
Ugh. Mom?

19:42.958 --> 19:43.833
- Dad?
- [Luke] Ow!

19:43.916 --> 19:45.500
- Oh, my God. Luke?
- [metal clangs]

19:45.583 --> 19:48.000
What are you doing under there?
You scared me.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.125
I scared you?

19:49.208 --> 19:50.875
Oh, my God. You're naked.

19:50.958 --> 19:51.875
What?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.416
- Okay, first of all, I'm not naked.
- Oh, right.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.708
My shirt was drying.

19:57.208 --> 20:00.916
And second of all, I'm only down there
because someone broke the faucet.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.208
Allegedly. And it was broken already.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.250
Fair.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.125
You mind giving me a hand?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.291
Only if I can get it back.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.041
Witty.

20:14.458 --> 20:18.041
All I need you to do is hold the faucet
steady while I tighten the connector.

20:18.125 --> 20:18.958
Got it?

20:19.041 --> 20:20.333
Easy-peasy.

20:20.916 --> 20:22.041
All right. Here, right here.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.041
Oh, okay. Yeah, got it.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.041
[grunts] You got it?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.875
Yeah. [sighs]

20:28.541 --> 20:30.000
[wrench clicking]

20:30.083 --> 20:32.916
[Luke grunts] Okay. All right.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.250
Here, oh, I--

20:35.333 --> 20:36.875
- Sorry. I was just gonna…
- Turn it.

20:39.791 --> 20:40.791
And voilà.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.458
Teamwork makes the dream work. Hmm.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.500
Wow, that's very impressive.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.750
[chuckles]

20:48.833 --> 20:50.000
Yoo-hoo!

20:50.083 --> 20:52.041
- Is anybody here?
- I, uh, um…

20:52.125 --> 20:53.666
Yep. I'll get that. [exhales]

20:54.666 --> 20:55.833
[Luke] I'll be in the back.

20:56.708 --> 20:59.458
- Denise. Hi.
- Hi. Are your parents around?

20:59.541 --> 21:01.291
Ah, no. Not yet.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.250
Is there something I can help you with?

21:03.333 --> 21:05.416
Well, I'd prefer
to speak with them privately.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.083
Oh, I'm sure anything
you have to say, I can handle it.

21:08.666 --> 21:11.041
I realize what a stressful time
it's been for your parents,

21:11.125 --> 21:14.625
and that's why I'm thrilled to let them
know that I have some good news.

21:14.708 --> 21:15.875
Oh, yeah? What is it?

21:16.458 --> 21:17.375
Squeeze Me.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.625
- No, thank you.
- [Denise chuckles]

21:19.708 --> 21:22.250
No, Squeeze Me, the juice bar.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.208
Oh, okay. What about it?

21:24.291 --> 21:26.250
I spoke to their
regional manager last night,

21:26.333 --> 21:29.666
and he's willing to take over
your parents' lease as of January 1st.

21:30.250 --> 21:33.083
Best of all,
he'll pay their entire backlog.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.583
[Ashley gasps]

21:34.666 --> 21:36.583
So your good news is that my parents

21:36.666 --> 21:40.083
are going to lose
the Rhythm Room to a-- a juice bar?

21:40.166 --> 21:43.500
- And be made whole in the process.
- Okay, how much could they owe?

21:44.958 --> 21:46.416
Six months' rent.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.500
- Plus maintenance, repairs.
- Uh…

21:49.583 --> 21:50.625
Interest.

21:51.375 --> 21:52.750
$30,000.

21:54.958 --> 21:56.125
[clears throat] Denise.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.166
The Rhythm Room,
it's-- it's a town staple.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.083
You cannot shut it down.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.791
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

34:04.875 --> 34:07.041
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

34:10.541 --> 34:11.541
[man] Yeah!

34:11.625 --> 34:14.041
- [Rodger] I almost lost my belt.
- [Troy] Yeah, I pulled it off.

34:14.125 --> 34:15.500
- Great job, fellas.
- [Troy] Thanks.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.500
- Yeah, I just stopped--
- Ashley?

34:17.583 --> 34:18.916
Hmm? Oh, hi.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.666
I must admit, when you
first mentioned your little "spectacular,"

34:22.750 --> 34:24.583
I thought it sounded a little…

34:24.666 --> 34:26.416
Mm… ridiculous?

34:26.958 --> 34:27.833
Optimistic.

34:27.916 --> 34:30.625
But I was wrong. It was great.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.416
Did you see
all those ladies that showed up?

34:32.500 --> 34:34.833
- Oh, they were loving it.
- [Denise] And you!

34:34.916 --> 34:37.750
- I…
- Congratulations on a great show.

34:37.833 --> 34:38.833
Oh, thank you.

34:39.458 --> 34:40.375
My number.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.875
- Oh, hey.
- Here you go.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.583
Everyone was clapping
and cheering and dancing.

34:48.666 --> 34:50.458
- It was like the old days.
- [Ashley chuckles]

34:50.541 --> 34:51.500
Sort of.

34:51.583 --> 34:52.958
- [all chuckle]
- [Ashley] Yeah.

34:53.041 --> 34:56.375
We haven't made that much
in one night in years. [chuckles]

34:57.583 --> 34:59.666
I'm just glad everyone had a nice time.

35:00.791 --> 35:04.333
Uh, excuse me, everyone.
I'd-- I'd like to make a toast.

35:04.416 --> 35:06.416
To… Ashley.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.333
[Ashley gulps, exhales]

35:08.416 --> 35:12.416
For taking a chance on a guy
who… didn't even want one.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.750
- [Marie chuckles]
- [Danny] Ha.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.333
Look, but seriously, uh,

35:16.333 --> 35:19.708
the fact that you were able
to put this whole thing together

35:19.791 --> 35:23.208
in such a short amount of time
is absolutely incredible.

35:23.291 --> 35:24.541
Thank you.

35:24.625 --> 35:28.291
Not to mention teach
a couple of goofy guys this choreography.

35:28.375 --> 35:29.958
- Good on you.
- [Dad laughs]

35:30.041 --> 35:31.958
You know, I had a really good partner.

35:32.041 --> 35:33.125
[sniffs]

35:34.958 --> 35:35.916
To Ashley.

35:36.791 --> 35:37.708
Oh, stop.

35:37.791 --> 35:39.250
- To Ashley.
- Yep.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.708
I can't take all the credit.

35:40.791 --> 35:43.791
I think I gotta give a shout-out
to the Merry Gentlemen.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.833
- Yes.
- With tidings of comfort and joy!

35:46.916 --> 35:50.208
Well, speaking of comfort and joy,
let's get you home.

35:50.291 --> 35:51.125
- Ooh.
- [Ashley] Oh.

35:51.208 --> 35:52.791
- [Rodger] All right.
- We're right here.

35:53.583 --> 35:56.541
Well… you pulled it off.

35:56.625 --> 35:57.958
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.041
[Danny] Looking good, Slick.

36:00.916 --> 36:02.750
You did look good, Slick.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.291
Funny.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.375
Oh, uh,

36:06.541 --> 36:07.583
I almost forgot.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.833
I got you a little something.
Just a little something to remember me by.

36:11.916 --> 36:13.083
- Mm.
- Luke.

36:13.166 --> 36:14.250
It's nothing, just…

36:15.416 --> 36:16.500
[Ashley] That's so sweet.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.041
Okay.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.333
I will forever be grateful to that wreath

36:23.416 --> 36:26.208
for pulling you into my life.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.375
This is…

36:30.916 --> 36:31.791
[sighs]

36:31.875 --> 36:33.333
- May I?
- Yeah. Uh…

36:37.708 --> 36:38.666
Yeah.

36:40.208 --> 36:41.291
[Luke] And…

36:42.833 --> 36:43.958
there we go.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.041
[inhales, sighs]

36:49.750 --> 36:50.833
Stunning.

36:51.541 --> 36:52.583
Thank you.

36:53.708 --> 36:55.958
You know, it's a nice night.

36:56.583 --> 36:57.833
May I walk you home?

36:59.375 --> 37:01.500
Only if we can get something to eat.

37:01.583 --> 37:02.416
I'm starving.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.416
[chuckles]

37:07.750 --> 37:09.208
- You know…
- Hmm?

37:09.291 --> 37:10.541
I have to admit,

37:11.500 --> 37:15.916
that pizza was a close second
to a New York slice.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.833
[chuckles]

37:17.458 --> 37:19.791
You know, they import
the water from the East Coast

37:19.875 --> 37:22.125
just to give it that authentic flavor.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.083
Is that true?

37:23.166 --> 37:24.791
I'm just kidding. I have no idea.

37:24.875 --> 37:25.958
[both laugh]

37:27.708 --> 37:29.750
So, tell me something about yourself.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.458
- Me?
- Yeah.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.875
You know, married, boyfriend?

37:35.500 --> 37:36.333
Uh…

37:36.416 --> 37:37.666
I don't mean to pry.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.291
I'm just making friendly conversation.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.041
No. None of the above.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.166
How about you?

37:44.250 --> 37:46.666
Uh, I <i>was </i>married.

37:46.750 --> 37:47.958
For a while.

37:48.041 --> 37:51.416
But that was a complete disaster.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.166
Sorry.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.583
Oh, thank you. But you know,
one good thing came out of it.

37:57.666 --> 37:58.750
What is that?

37:58.833 --> 38:00.125
Sycamore Creek.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.833
It's funny. I moved here for her.

38:03.916 --> 38:06.250
Ironically, I'm the one
who ended up staying.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.833
[Ashley] Hmm.

38:07.916 --> 38:09.000
I mean, this is…

38:10.000 --> 38:12.416
I don't know. It's the best place
I could have asked for.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.000
I wish I knew what to ask for.

38:15.875 --> 38:17.250
Or who to ask.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.750
You know, hold that thought.

38:22.416 --> 38:23.833
You focus on the what.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.625
I think I know the who.

38:26.708 --> 38:27.708
Come on.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.458
Uh, excuse me, Santa.

38:34.541 --> 38:36.666
Hi. Time for one more?

38:36.750 --> 38:40.333
Well, that depends.
Have you been naughty or nice?

38:40.416 --> 38:43.333
Are you serious? I haven't
done this since elementary school.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.250
Oh, well, then you are long overdue.

38:46.333 --> 38:47.916
Merry Christmas, you two.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.375
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.875
- [Santa chuckles]
- All right. Oh.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.166
- Sit. The whole experience.
- [Ashley clears throat]

38:54.250 --> 38:55.291
- [elf] There we go.
- Yes.

38:56.166 --> 38:57.125
Yep.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.458
- Hmm.
- Don't mind if I do.

39:01.541 --> 39:02.708
- [Ashley] Okay.
- [Luke] Oh.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.791
[Santa] All right, now.
On the count of three,

39:05.875 --> 39:08.791
I want you
to give me your best "ho, ho, ho!"

39:08.875 --> 39:09.916
- Ready?
- Yep.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.708
One, two, three.

39:12.791 --> 39:14.875
[all] Ho, ho, ho!

39:15.375 --> 39:16.541
[camera shutter clicks]

39:18.000 --> 39:20.166
What? What is it?

39:20.250 --> 39:21.291
Nothing.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.916
No, no. You don't get to do that.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.666
I just took my shirt off
for half the town.

39:25.750 --> 39:27.375
- [chuckles]
- You owe me.

39:29.791 --> 39:31.333
I don't know. I was just…

39:31.958 --> 39:34.125
[clears throat] Well…

39:35.375 --> 39:36.750
I was just thinking…

39:38.833 --> 39:40.666
it's always been me on stage,

39:41.708 --> 39:43.750
and I was always in the spotlight.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.958
It's all I ever wanted to do, was perform.

39:47.791 --> 39:48.666
But?

39:49.750 --> 39:50.708
But

39:51.916 --> 39:53.500
watching you guys tonight

39:54.375 --> 39:56.666
and seeing how far you've come,

39:56.750 --> 39:59.791
I mean, it was unexpectedly…

40:02.375 --> 40:03.375
enjoyable.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.125
Do you miss performing?

40:08.833 --> 40:09.833
I did.

40:10.916 --> 40:11.833
[Luke] Hmm.

40:12.625 --> 40:13.833
You know what they say.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.250
When one door closes, another one opens.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.083
Okay. So then…

40:22.458 --> 40:23.916
what's behind this door?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.333
Just a carpenter.

40:39.958 --> 40:41.166
[Ashley] All right.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.458
[exhales] I think we might
just pull this off.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.500
[ornaments jingling]

40:53.583 --> 40:54.833
[Mom] Oh, look at that.

40:55.541 --> 40:57.916
Well, that is impressive.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.333
- Oh.
- I thought Marie was the artist.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.250
Oh, and look.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.916
$2,200. First night.

41:04.416 --> 41:05.375
Oh.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.291
I hope you didn't
spend it all on those groceries.

41:08.375 --> 41:11.375
Oh, uh, actually, I was thinking.

41:11.458 --> 41:16.291
Remember the old <i>bûche de Noël</i>
you used to serve every year?

41:16.375 --> 41:17.583
What about it?

41:19.166 --> 41:21.083
Do you think
you can remember how to make it?

41:21.791 --> 41:23.333
Well, of course.

41:23.416 --> 41:27.125
I just can't remember when we had
enough customers for it to be worthwhile.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.750

[Ashley] Why didn't you tell me?

42:26.125 --> 42:27.625
About the Rhythm Room.

42:28.375 --> 42:31.625
Because you had
more important things to do

42:31.708 --> 42:34.125
than worry about
some dinky hole-in-the-wall.

42:35.500 --> 42:40.625
I remember when you were a little girl
singing and dancing up on that stage.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.083
And now look at you.

42:43.250 --> 42:44.916
I don't think I could have done any of it

42:45.000 --> 42:47.958
without the Rhythm Room
being such a big part of my childhood.

42:48.708 --> 42:52.083
I can't imagine it all going away.

one of our first acts,
fresh from the Grand Ole Opry,

42:59.125 --> 43:01.166
told me something I'll never forget.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.333
"It's not performing that's important,

43:04.958 --> 43:07.541
it's who you're performing for."

43:09.416 --> 43:10.541
I'm so glad you're here.

43:10.625 --> 43:11.791
Yeah, me too.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.750
All right, well, I have to take off.

43:13.833 --> 43:16.041
But I will see you tonight.

- Mm-hmm.
- [Mom laughs]

- [Mom] Aw.
- Bye, Mom.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.000

- [Marie chuckles]

Look what I have.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.208
- Is that a review?
- [Marie] Mm-hmm.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.166
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I can't do it. You read it.

Okay. Here we go.

Don't let them push you around out there.

01:07:27.666 --> 01:07:29.208
- Promise me?
- Promise.

01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:32.958
So, were you able to connect with Luke?

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:35.583
[sighs]

01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:36.875
He won't talk to me.

01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:39.125
I can't say that I blame him.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.791
Well, have you tried reaching out to him?

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:45.041
Maybe he just, you know,
needed some time to process everything.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:47.875
I tried calling him. He didn't answer.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.958
- You wanna try a little harder?
- Okay, and do what?

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:55.250
Show up to his house
holding up a boombox on his lawn?

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:57.833
Wouldn't be the worst idea.

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:02.125
I just feel like
I'm the last person he wants to talk to.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:04.125
You don't know that.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:07.708
I know you have feelings for him.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:12.291
Yeah, like, the biggest feelings I've had…

01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:14.083
[exhales] …in a long time.

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:15.916
Then you have to tell him.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.875
Come on, you're gonna regret it
if you don't.

01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.416
He needs to know how you feel.

have to lose at this point?

I don't know.

01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:28.541
Just think about it.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.708
He's a really, really good guy, Ashley.

01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:33.291
[Ashley] I know.

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.666
- [driver] How you doing?
- [Ashley] Good. How are you?

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:52.916

Rog, you keep coming in late on
the first hip thrust. Let's clean it up.

01:09:09.458 --> 01:09:12.041
Maybe you should talk to Troy.
If he's late, that makes me late.

01:09:12.125 --> 01:09:14.333
Did he say Troy?
I'm pretty sure he said Rodger.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.916
No, I'm late because
I'm taking my cue from you, slowpoke.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.041
Uh, yeah, don't look at me.

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:20.958
My timing's always impeccable,
unlike some fools back here.

longer than you've been alive, kid.

Let's just focus on
the choreography we've learned

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.791
and tighten up the cues, okay?

01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:44.416
Good.

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:47.083

Well, the expert isn't here, is she?

01:09:50.041 --> 01:09:52.833

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:05.875
We got a sold-out show tonight.

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:08.250
Stan, Lily, they're depending on us.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:11.208
It is Christmas Eve.
Do you know what that means?

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:13.500
That means if tonight doesn't work out,

01:10:13.583 --> 01:10:16.458
you can say bye-bye
to the Rhythm Room forever.

- Why don't we all just take a five?

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.375
[Marie] Sis, you forgot me.

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:45.333
[Ashley] Oh, sorry. It's a far reach.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.416
[indistinct chatter]

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.125
Hi. I was surprised to get your call.

01:18:57.041 --> 01:18:58.750
Just as I promised.

01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:00.458
Every penny.

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:02.541
Thank you.

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:03.458
[Ashley] Mm-hmm.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:07.625
Ashley… I owe you an apology.

01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:10.583
I underestimated you.

01:19:11.291 --> 01:19:15.333
What you have done with this place
in such a short amount of time is just…

01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:16.750
[Ashley chuckles]

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:18.333
[Denise] I'm very impressed.

01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:19.416
Thank you.

01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:21.250
I did it all for them.

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:30.166
But that is not
the only reason I invited you today.

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:32.083
- Oh.
- Yes.

01:19:32.166 --> 01:19:35.750
Christmas dinner at the Rhythm Room
is a bit of a tradition around here.

01:19:35.833 --> 01:19:37.041
Yes.

01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:38.250
And thanks to you,

01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:40.625
it's a tradition
that won't go away any time soon.

01:19:40.708 --> 01:19:43.000
Yes. We would love for you to join us.

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:48.125
[hesitates] I'd--

01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:49.708
I'd be honored to join. [chuckles]

01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:52.125
Get in here. We'll put you at the head.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.000
[Luke] So

01:19:58.541 --> 01:20:01.625
what's next for the famous Ashley Davis?

01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:05.875
You know, for the first time
in my whole life, I have no idea.

01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:07.708
[chuckles]

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:12.541
But whatever it is,
it will be right here in Sycamore Creek.

01:20:15.208 --> 01:20:16.208
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:18.416 --> 01:20:21.666
You know, my whole life,
all I ever wanted to do was be on stage.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:24.541
Now I realize none of that matters

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.750
if you're not surrounded
by the people you love.

01:20:27.916 --> 01:20:29.041
You know,

01:20:29.625 --> 01:20:32.208
it's not performing that's important.

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.541
It's who you perform for.

01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:40.791
Well, that's good advice.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.458
Do you have a favorite Christmas memory?

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:20.916
Uh…

01:21:21.583 --> 01:21:23.791
Yeah, I do, actually.

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:24.875
You do?

01:21:25.958 --> 01:21:26.958
