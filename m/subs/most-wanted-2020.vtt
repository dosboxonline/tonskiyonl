[birds chirping]

02:17.102 --> 02:18.371
Hey.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.173
We're done.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.142
All right.

02:23.175 --> 02:24.777
[sighs]

02:44.063 --> 02:45.765
There you go. Thanks.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.269
Thanks.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.773
Thanks.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.587
[beeping]

03:08.487 --> 03:11.291
[line ringing] [sighs]

03:12.925 --> 03:15.828
[woman] Allô? [operator] You have
a collect call from...

03:16.062 --> 03:17.630
Daniel Léger.

03:17.763 --> 03:19.799
[operator] Would you like to
accept charges?

03:19.932 --> 03:21.600
[woman] Yes.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.703
[in French]

04:04.977 --> 04:06.379
Uh...

04:20.426 --> 04:22.929
Allô? [line clicks, dial tone]

04:26.099 --> 04:27.834
$7.50. [in English] Yeah.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.105
Add, uh, one of these,
okay? Yeah.

04:32.238 --> 04:35.375
Let me just go
grab my wallet.
I'll be right back.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.622
[engine starting]

04:50.956 --> 04:52.458
Hey!

04:55.795 --> 04:59.164
At any given time,
about how many children
do you have in your care

04:59.298 --> 05:00.933
at the institution,
Mr. Woodbridge?

05:01.067 --> 05:03.803
Despite massive cuts
in government grants,

05:03.936 --> 05:06.705
we've managed to keep caring
for more than 20 kids,

05:06.839 --> 05:08.574
which is why we
created the foundation--

05:08.707 --> 05:10.142
Yes, but before we get to that,

05:10.276 --> 05:11.543
I'd like you to outline
your methods

05:11.677 --> 05:13.212
for dealing with
difficult children,

05:13.346 --> 05:14.681
if you don't mind.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.915
Certainly, uh,

05:16.048 --> 05:19.518
but, if I may finish,
the foundation--

05:19.651 --> 05:22.521
Now, I'm speaking specifically
about the recent suicides

05:22.654 --> 05:24.790
of two young boys,
ages 11 and 12,

05:24.924 --> 05:27.593
that were in your care
at the institution.

05:29.561 --> 05:31.830
Norm! No, no. Not now.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.132
[device vibrating]

05:33.265 --> 05:34.466
What was that?

05:34.599 --> 05:36.568
[vibrating continues]

05:37.035 --> 05:40.039
Somebody's trying to get
ahold of you, Mr. Malarek.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.608
And I think it's time
for me to leave too.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.777
Oh, shit. We have testimonies on tape
if you'd like to hear them

05:45.911 --> 05:47.813
and refresh your memory,
you piece of shit.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.782
[Norm]
Mr. Woodbridge, I'm so sorry
about the interruption.

05:50.916 --> 05:54.386
I-I-- We have a few
more questions. Mr.--

05:55.020 --> 05:57.089
Why in the hell did you leave
your pager on, man?

05:57.222 --> 05:59.458
Ah, it doesn't matter.
We got that son of a bitch.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.494
I know, but if it went off
20 seconds earlier,

06:01.627 --> 06:04.296
we would've had nothing. Yeah, but did you see
the look on his face?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.032
I did. Victor, security left
a message.

06:06.165 --> 06:09.268
Some guys from the Da Silva
gang are looking for you.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.904
They're here? Yeah. Front reception.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.740
Ah...

06:14.507 --> 06:15.875
[sighs]

06:18.377 --> 06:20.947
Victor, what
is this about? What?

06:21.447 --> 06:23.483
Do you want me
to call the police? Shit.

06:25.584 --> 06:26.986
Do you want me
to call the police?

06:27.119 --> 06:28.187
What? The police.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.089
No! No, no, no, no.
No police.

06:32.257 --> 06:33.493
Get your camera.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.264
[man 1] He's here!
Come on, let's go!

06:39.731 --> 06:42.068
[man 2] Malarek! Malarek!

06:43.870 --> 06:45.104
Shit.

06:47.339 --> 06:49.908
Where are you going?
Malarek, stop!

06:50.709 --> 06:52.578
Get in the car! [Norm] Let's go.

06:52.711 --> 06:54.814
Get these fuckers!
Get them!

06:56.516 --> 06:58.885
Are you filming?
Rolling? Okay, let's go.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.492
[tires squealing]

07:07.794 --> 07:08.927
Fuck.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.464
[tires screeching]

07:25.944 --> 07:26.979
Oh, shit.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.218
Oh, shit.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.129
Aw, fuck me.

07:44.496 --> 07:46.599
[bell ringing]

07:56.409 --> 07:59.045
[tires squealing]

08:10.289 --> 08:13.125
You run from us to a hospital?
Expect to get hurt, Malarek?

08:13.258 --> 08:15.928
You think I'm running away
from you, you piece of shit?

08:16.461 --> 08:17.696
Huh?

08:18.597 --> 08:20.532
Write another article
about Da Silva,

08:20.666 --> 08:22.701
we'll make sure
you end up in here.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.370
Let's get out of here.

08:24.503 --> 08:26.906
You tell Da Silva
he can kiss my ass.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.711
[elevator bell dings]

08:32.044 --> 08:33.278
Oh!

08:33.646 --> 08:35.480
Hi. I'm looking
for Anna Malarek's room.

08:35.614 --> 08:37.049
Victor! Anna Mala--

08:37.182 --> 08:38.417
Oh, God. Denise.

08:38.550 --> 08:40.118
We paged you over
and over.

08:40.252 --> 08:42.020
I was in an interview. I hope it was worth it.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.257
It cost you a moment
you'll never get back.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.793
She's done already? Some things don't work
around your schedule.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.196
How is she? She's fine.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.534
[sighs]

09:04.910 --> 09:07.146
[Victor whispering]
Hey. Hey.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.148
I'm so sorry.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.416
It's okay.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.118
No, it's not.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.620
I missed everything.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.223
She moves fast.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.625
Like her dad.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.064
There you go.

09:27.866 --> 09:30.036
Yeah, that's your dad.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.737
Oh.

09:32.437 --> 09:33.906
Hi.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.312
Yeah.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.717
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.321
Stay with me. Yeah.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.958
Good.

09:53.525 --> 09:56.394
Wow. Well done.

09:56.528 --> 09:58.097

announced it.

Friday night,

10:52.985 --> 10:54.987
I don't know what the hell
they were thinking.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.188

10:56.322 --> 10:57.757

11:00.526 --> 11:01.827
What?

11:02.561 --> 11:03.963
I'm fine.

11:06.965 --> 11:08.968
I knew I wasn't gonna get it.

11:46.371 --> 11:48.107
[rattles door handle]

11:57.282 --> 11:58.617
Can I help you?

11:59.351 --> 12:01.921
Uh, I'm the guy
who rented this place.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.989
You must have
the wrong address.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.158
Um...

12:06.458 --> 12:07.492
Where's Michael?

12:07.793 --> 12:09.395
You know Michael?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.565
[Victor] What do you mean,
I don't deliver?

12:14.499 --> 12:18.270
Well, uh, we haven't had
anything from you
in two months.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.971
I just gave you
the Da Silva story.

12:20.105 --> 12:21.540
That was
a follow-up piece.

12:22.107 --> 12:23.475
You want
shocking stories?

12:23.608 --> 12:24.743
They take
serious research.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.579
Long-term investigations
take time.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.147
Then perhaps
you should spend

12:29.280 --> 12:30.749
a little less time
on your TV show

12:30.883 --> 12:32.351
and a little more time
here with us.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.553
The TV thing's part-time.
You know that.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.324
Mr. Malarek, when you
write something new,
we'll pay you for it.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.794
But from now on,
when you write nothing,
we pay nothing.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.832
Did I just get fired? No, no.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.367
You're just gonna be
freelance.

12:49.001 --> 12:53.139
Oh, Art, come on.
You can't make me a stringer.
I just had a baby.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.841
Why don't you just let me
give you regular
assignments, that's it?

12:55.975 --> 12:57.777
I don't do
regular assignments.

12:57.910 --> 13:01.680
Ha! Okay. But your mind's
in 93 orbits at once.

13:01.813 --> 13:03.815
You just gotta
land on something.
I don't give a shit.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.151
Pick an easy subject.
You do one story a week,

13:06.285 --> 13:08.119
you make the exact
same money. That's it.

13:08.253 --> 13:09.554
[sighs]

13:10.355 --> 13:12.391
Look, Art, it's not
about the money, all right?

13:12.524 --> 13:13.826
It's about my process.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.627
All right.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.931
You and you process
get together,
do one story a week.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.435
I'd like to cash this.

13:24.836 --> 13:28.140
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 100...

13:50.095 --> 13:52.131
There you go. Cheers, man.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.868
What can I get for you?

13:56.702 --> 13:57.802
Directions.

13:57.936 --> 13:59.805
What do you mean
by directions?

14:00.405 --> 14:02.374
Looking for a guy
called Michael.

14:14.753 --> 14:17.756
Gentlemen, it is my true
honor to be here today.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.393
And I welcome the chance to work
with each and every one of you.

But make no mistake.

in a war on drugs.

I want to show you.

are you doing on my boat?

asking me for money?
I owe you?

where you leave all your stuff.

Now, Michael tells me
you brought some
Thai number four into BC.

17:55.473 --> 17:57.142
He told you that, huh?

17:58.677 --> 18:00.112
Shit.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.213
I'd love to taste that.

that shit anywhere here.

Throw me a quote here.

Anything I can use
other than, "It's a tragedy"?

24:01.506 --> 24:03.775
Well, the point of
an operation like this

24:03.908 --> 24:06.344
is to make Canada
a safer place.

24:06.478 --> 24:09.514
Now, a major heroin pipeline
was shut down.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.883
And when an officer
dies in the line of duty,

24:12.016 --> 24:15.454
it's a sad reminder of how
dangerous this job really is.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.088
Okay.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.725
I read the press release.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.494
But this asshole you arrested,
why is he still in Thailand?

24:23.627 --> 24:27.332
We were invited only
to assist the Thai police
for this operation, Malarek.

24:27.465 --> 24:30.569
He'll be prosecuted there. But what's
this prick's story?

Everything's in
the press release. Nothing's in the press release.

How long has this guy been
running heroin out of BC?

I don't have
any more comments.

24:37.842 --> 24:39.610
The matter is before
the courts in Bangkok, okay?

24:39.744 --> 24:43.381
I'm not allowed to discuss
the intricacies of this,
especially with you.

I'm Jim Raiven, the embassy's

33:55.800 --> 33:58.836
a Canadian prisoner
you guys arrested,
and I went to the prison, and--

33:58.969 --> 34:01.138
This case is still under

34:06.643 --> 34:09.247
Did the embassy
put me on a blacklist

I suggest you read
the press release

153, 160 or 171...

1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:54.129
Cadet, we are giving you
an opportunity

1:08:54.263 --> 1:08:56.031
for some
in-the-field training.

1:08:56.164 --> 1:08:58.166
Operation Goliath
needs a new man.

1:08:58.300 --> 1:08:59.701
This would
not be paid work

1:08:59.835 --> 1:09:01.870
and would require you
to take makeup classes when--

1:09:02.004 --> 1:09:03.305
I'm in.

1:09:03.672 --> 1:09:06.074
You're interested? Fuck yeah.

1:09:06.207 --> 1:09:07.576
All right,

1:09:07.709 --> 1:09:12.247
let me make one thing
perfectly clear right now.

1:09:12.914 --> 1:09:17.519
Any bullshit, any improvisation
or deviation from my orders

1:09:18.053 --> 1:09:23.658
will result in a strict,
official reprimand
to your superiors.

1:09:23.792 --> 1:09:24.893
Do you understand?

1:09:25.027 --> 1:09:27.229
I won't let you down,
Dad.

1:09:38.006 --> 1:09:39.842
[men shouting in Thai]

1:09:39.975 --> 1:09:41.577
Khun tay!

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:44.913
[echoing] Khun tay!

1:09:45.447 --> 1:09:48.584
[breathing heavily]

1:09:55.357 --> 1:09:57.193
[gasps]

1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:33.362
[sighs]

1:10:43.772 --> 1:10:44.873
[man] Psst!

1:11:07.863 --> 1:11:09.398
You did good today.

1:11:10.765 --> 1:11:13.936
[groans]
I gotta disagree on that.

1:11:17.939 --> 1:11:20.909
Hey, what does, uh...

1:11:21.910 --> 1:11:23.746
khun tay mean?

1:11:26.115 --> 1:11:30.319
Khun tay? Yeah. Khun tay.

1:11:32.721 --> 1:11:35.391
Khun tay means,
"You're dead."

1:11:37.726 --> 1:11:39.395
Shit.

1:11:43.432 --> 1:11:44.867
[sighs]

1:11:58.446 --> 1:11:59.481
Who's this new guy?

1:11:59.614 --> 1:12:01.115
Denis is out.
Al's in.

1:12:01.249 --> 1:12:02.817
[sighs]

1:12:02.951 --> 1:12:05.020
-He knows the story?
-Which story is that?

1:12:05.153 --> 1:12:07.289
The one where you said
you had a huge player
on the line

1:12:07.422 --> 1:12:10.392
that tries to stick us
for travel costs
and then does a Houdini?

1:12:10.525 --> 1:12:12.827
I don't have him
in a fucking cage.

1:12:12.961 --> 1:12:14.330
Get in.

1:12:16.297 --> 1:12:18.100
[engine starts]

1:12:19.567 --> 1:12:21.069
[Al] Guess what.

1:12:21.203 --> 1:12:24.540
A cage is exactly what you're in
until you find this prick.

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:29.811
Here you go, baby. [sighs] Thanks.

1:12:30.412 --> 1:12:32.047
You all right? Yeah.

1:12:32.414 --> 1:12:34.383
Hey, Norm. Hi.

1:12:37.152 --> 1:12:39.888
[exhales] Hello!
Oh, my God.

1:12:40.021 --> 1:12:43.291
You're a lifesaver, man. I got it.
My pleasure.

1:12:43.425 --> 1:12:44.693
[sighs]

1:12:44.827 --> 1:12:46.461
So they can't find us here?

1:12:46.594 --> 1:12:48.897
Trust me.
This is so much better
than a hotel.

1:12:49.030 --> 1:12:52.367
Just stay with Norm. He'll be
with you till I get back, okay? Okay.

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.570
I love you. I love you too.

1:13:01.910 --> 1:13:03.512
[sighs]

1:13:10.218 --> 1:13:11.520
[elevator bell dings]

1:13:15.724 --> 1:13:17.693
Well, what's this?
Where's this gonna go?

1:13:18.393 --> 1:13:19.494
Put that down.

1:13:19.628 --> 1:13:21.063
Where the hell
is my story?

1:13:21.196 --> 1:13:22.597
Hey. When did you get in?

1:13:22.730 --> 1:13:25.200
Léger told David Miller
to go fuck himself.

1:13:25.334 --> 1:13:27.603
The Sun didn't get
the article. I did.
I delivered.

1:13:27.736 --> 1:13:29.271
Where the fuck is
my front page, Art?

1:13:29.404 --> 1:13:31.640
Your junkie pal made some
pretty serious accusations.

1:13:31.773 --> 1:13:34.109
And, you know, it could
blow up in our face.

1:13:34.242 --> 1:13:36.912
Excuse me? The government
can wipe its ass
with an innocent victim,

1:13:37.045 --> 1:13:40.115
and we're not gonna report
on it because, what,
the victim's a junkie?

1:13:40.248 --> 1:13:41.416
Is that what's
going on here?

1:13:41.550 --> 1:13:43.251
Well, he robbed
a gas station.

1:13:43.385 --> 1:13:44.486
What?

1:13:44.620 --> 1:13:46.421
He robbed
a gas station.

1:13:46.555 --> 1:13:49.291
So, I don't know.
He's not as innocent
as you might think.

1:13:49.424 --> 1:13:51.326
Oh, he robbed
a gas station? Yeah.

1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:52.828
So that gives
the federal police the right

1:13:52.961 --> 1:13:54.763
to leave him in Thailand
to get the death penalty.

1:13:54.896 --> 1:13:56.598
That makes a lot
of fucking sense.

1:13:56.732 --> 1:13:58.433
Meanwhile,
they can cover up
their colossal clusterfuck

1:13:58.566 --> 1:14:00.702
because the media
is sitting here sucking
its collective dick

1:14:00.836 --> 1:14:02.504
all because the victim's
not a nice guy?

1:14:02.638 --> 1:14:05.573
Would you just relax?
Did I say I wasn't gonna run
the story? No.

1:14:05.707 --> 1:14:07.609
I'm having it
checked first, all right?

1:14:07.742 --> 1:14:10.044
Why are you making
this thing personal?

1:14:10.178 --> 1:14:12.780
Lawyer's at 3:00.
Make the necessary cuts.

1:14:12.914 --> 1:14:14.482
It'll run tomorrow, all right?

1:14:14.616 --> 1:14:16.585
On Page 5?
Below the fold?

1:14:16.718 --> 1:14:18.987
No follow-up?
Everyone moves on?

1:14:19.587 --> 1:14:22.824
Meanwhile, a Canadian citizen
is executed in
a fucking third-world country,

1:14:22.958 --> 1:14:25.994
and we're not gonna do
a fucking thing about it, Art?

1:14:26.494 --> 1:14:27.830
I'm sorry.

1:14:34.870 --> 1:14:37.005
You know how you gave me
my first story?

1:14:38.039 --> 1:14:40.341
You made me the journalist
I am today.

1:14:40.475 --> 1:14:42.044
I never thanked you
for that.

1:14:44.912 --> 1:14:46.581
Can you have somebody
just put my stuff in a box?

1:14:46.715 --> 1:14:48.082
I'll pick it up tomorrow. Come on, Vic.

1:14:48.216 --> 1:14:50.018
No, you guys aren't
into my stuff anymore.

1:14:50.152 --> 1:14:52.855
I should have heard you
when you said it last week.

1:15:12.507 --> 1:15:13.909
[elevator door opens]

1:15:47.609 --> 1:15:49.645
Hey. Hi.

1:15:51.413 --> 1:15:55.150
Um, I'm a friend of Daniel's,
and I know you guys
know each other,

1:15:55.283 --> 1:15:57.552
and I'm looking for him,
but I don't know where he is.

1:15:57.685 --> 1:15:59.154
Do you know where
I can find him?

1:16:00.121 --> 1:16:01.189
No.

1:16:02.024 --> 1:16:04.092
So you're telling me
you don't know him?

1:16:04.225 --> 1:16:06.928
No, I'm telling you
I have no idea where he is.

1:16:07.062 --> 1:16:10.766
Oh. All fucking
and no talking, huh?

1:16:10.899 --> 1:16:13.034
Wow. Would you be
my girlfriend?

1:16:13.167 --> 1:16:14.369
All right.

1:16:14.503 --> 1:16:16.204
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1:16:23.311 --> 1:16:25.581
How's your little
side business going?

1:16:38.026 --> 1:16:39.194
Danny!

1:16:48.370 --> 1:16:49.971
Why does he want
to see me?

1:16:50.104 --> 1:16:52.674
[Al] 'Cause he's the boss.
He says he wants to meet you.

1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:07.656
[car door opens]

1:17:09.190 --> 1:17:10.359
Hop in.

1:17:21.302 --> 1:17:25.641
Frank and Glen have told me
great things about you, Daniel.

1:17:26.107 --> 1:17:27.341
Really?

1:17:28.075 --> 1:17:30.678
The way we see it,
this works out,

1:17:31.212 --> 1:17:33.215
could become
a regular deal.

1:17:34.982 --> 1:17:38.086
See, we're looking to expand
our operations in Thailand.

1:17:38.553 --> 1:17:40.255
We'd like you
to help us out.

1:17:41.056 --> 1:17:44.859
Well, Don, I'd--
I'd really like to help you...

1:17:45.760 --> 1:17:47.329
but I-I can't afford
to go to Thailand.

1:17:47.462 --> 1:17:48.730
Hmm?

1:17:49.331 --> 1:17:51.866
Well, how'd you get
the money for the train ticket?

1:17:52.534 --> 1:17:54.703
I spent everything
I had on it.

1:17:55.470 --> 1:17:57.939
[Don] Well, you know...

1:17:58.773 --> 1:18:00.108
from now on,

1:18:00.242 --> 1:18:02.209
I'm taking care
of everything.

1:18:02.343 --> 1:18:06.481
Flight, hotel, expenses,
the whole shebang.

1:18:06.614 --> 1:18:09.551
No more fucking around, kid.
You're going to Thailand.

1:18:09.684 --> 1:18:11.519
Well, what about
my passport?

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:13.921
Don't worry.
Al took care of it.

1:18:14.055 --> 1:18:16.223
We fast-tracked it.
Ready to be picked up.

1:18:16.691 --> 1:18:20.195
Yeah, we even got you a hotel
room right next to the airport.

1:18:20.328 --> 1:18:22.564
You're going
to Thailand tomorrow.

1:18:22.697 --> 1:18:24.899
Tomorrow? Daniel.

1:18:25.033 --> 1:18:28.236
It's just a couple of days.
Quick in and out.

1:18:29.904 --> 1:18:32.174
Thanks, Daniel. Yeah.

1:18:39.414 --> 1:18:40.449
All right,
let's go.

1:18:43.518 --> 1:18:44.986
Come on.

1:18:56.965 --> 1:19:00.501
[George H.W. Bush on monitor]
And I challenge the Democrats
to stand up on this point.

1:19:01.169 --> 1:19:02.704
They say this is a war.

1:19:02.837 --> 1:19:04.406
Then treat it as such.

1:19:04.539 --> 1:19:08.744
We've got to fight the drug war
on all four fronts at once.

1:19:08.877 --> 1:19:12.079
Shrinking the supply
by destroying crops and labs

1:19:12.213 --> 1:19:14.482
and by patrolling
our borders vigorously,

1:19:14.616 --> 1:19:18.420
increasing both the certainty
and the severity of punishment--

1:19:25.259 --> 1:19:28.929
If you sell drugs,
you will be caught.
And when you're caught--

1:19:29.063 --> 1:19:30.498
Norm. [turns off monitor]

1:19:31.065 --> 1:19:33.134
This stuff is gold.
Did you know that the DEA

1:19:33.267 --> 1:19:35.203
might have been pressuring
the BC police to get results?

1:19:35.336 --> 1:19:37.739
I mean, if we can find out
what the US quota system is--

1:19:37.872 --> 1:19:39.941
Victor, listen. What?

1:19:40.075 --> 1:19:41.809
I've been reassigned
to another project.

1:19:41.943 --> 1:19:43.478
That's just gonna
have to wait, man.

1:19:43.611 --> 1:19:45.213
Well, apparently,
it can't.

1:19:45.814 --> 1:19:47.415
Look, I-I love
this junkie story too,

1:19:47.549 --> 1:19:49.417
but Randy doesn't want me
to work on it, so...

1:19:49.550 --> 1:19:51.919
The Globe paid for half
of our investigation.

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.789
It doesn't make any sense to
take our foot off the gas now.

1:19:54.922 --> 1:19:58.392
If we just go to BC,
we dig a little bit, we're-- [knocking on door]

1:19:58.993 --> 1:20:01.229
Victor, Randy
wants to see you.

[sighs]

1:20:08.069 --> 1:20:09.571
[knocks on glass]

1:20:10.338 --> 1:20:11.372
Come in.

1:20:11.706 --> 1:20:13.108
Have a seat.

1:20:15.210 --> 1:20:18.313
Victor, I've got
to let you go.

1:20:21.082 --> 1:20:23.184
I thought you said
that the show

1:20:23.818 --> 1:20:25.920
was kicking ass
since I got here.

1:20:26.053 --> 1:20:28.522
Yeah. I don't have
a choice.

1:20:28.656 --> 1:20:29.957
It's budget cuts.

1:20:30.091 --> 1:20:31.960
You know I left
The Globe and Mail, right?

1:20:32.093 --> 1:20:34.829
Yeah, I know.

1:20:35.863 --> 1:20:39.467
This doesn't have anything
to do with the junkie
investigation, does it?

1:20:39.601 --> 1:20:41.035
No, no.

1:20:41.669 --> 1:20:45.606
Nothing at all to do
with the federal police
or anything like that?

1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:48.476
It's got nothing
to do with that.

1:20:51.679 --> 1:20:53.248
[sighs]

1:21:03.959 --> 1:21:06.527
[knocks on door] Yeah. Yeah,
it'll be fine.

1:21:06.661 --> 1:21:10.331
Yeah. No, no. It's not
a question of the space.

1:21:10.598 --> 1:21:11.733
Look at this.

1:21:11.866 --> 1:21:14.035
Yeah. No, no,
space is fine.

1:21:14.169 --> 1:21:16.504
That's not an issue.
It's the, uh...

1:21:16.971 --> 1:21:19.174
It's the, uh... Hang--
No, hang on a second.

1:21:21.075 --> 1:21:22.544
Victor, a call for you.

1:21:22.677 --> 1:21:24.312
One second, Bianca.

1:21:26.414 --> 1:21:29.117
So, uh,
what did he want?

1:21:29.951 --> 1:21:31.486
Uh...

1:21:32.487 --> 1:21:33.788
I got fired.

1:21:33.921 --> 1:21:36.625
What? Why?

1:21:38.159 --> 1:21:39.793
I'm not sure.

1:21:39.927 --> 1:21:41.429
[scoffs]

1:21:46.434 --> 1:21:48.169
Yeah? [man] Uh, Mr. Malarek.

1:21:48.302 --> 1:21:50.905
I'm calling from the
Public Complaints Commission.

1:21:51.039 --> 1:21:52.740
Complaints Commission?
I've never heard of you.

1:21:52.873 --> 1:21:54.942
Yeah, we're a new entity.
Listen.

1:21:55.076 --> 1:21:59.580
I just read your article
on the Daniel Léger case.
I'd like to discuss it with you.

1:21:59.714 --> 1:22:01.682
I don't work for
The Globe anymore.

1:22:01.816 --> 1:22:03.818
In fact, I don't work
for anyone. So I won't be
doing any follow-ups.

1:22:03.951 --> 1:22:07.288
No, I-I'm not calling to give
you information, Mr. Malarek.

1:22:07.421 --> 1:22:10.025
I think maybe I'd like
to make this our first case.

1:22:10.158 --> 1:22:13.094
I need the details
of your investigation.

1:22:27.908 --> 1:22:29.377
All right, stop.

1:22:30.645 --> 1:22:32.313
[knocking on door]

1:22:32.647 --> 1:22:33.682
[door opens]

1:22:35.015 --> 1:22:36.083
Oh, hey, buddy.

1:22:36.217 --> 1:22:37.986
How are you doing?

1:22:38.653 --> 1:22:39.587
Good.

1:22:39.721 --> 1:22:41.790
Come on in. Relax.

1:22:42.424 --> 1:22:46.127
Flight leaves tomorrow.
Frank will call you
with the exact time.

1:22:46.261 --> 1:22:47.929
And make sure
he's on the fucking plane.

1:22:48.062 --> 1:22:49.631
Don't worry.
He'll be there.

1:22:52.733 --> 1:22:55.170
Do you mind if we stay here
a couple more days?

1:22:55.903 --> 1:22:57.138
No, sure.

1:22:57.739 --> 1:22:58.773
What?

1:22:58.906 --> 1:23:00.642
I need to go to Montreal.

1:23:00.775 --> 1:23:02.576
Why? Uh...

1:23:02.710 --> 1:23:06.314
I need to speak to
the Complaints Commission
about the federal police.

1:23:07.181 --> 1:23:08.950
You're making a complaint
against the feds?

1:23:09.084 --> 1:23:11.519
No, the Complaints Commission
read my article in The Globe,

1:23:11.652 --> 1:23:14.655
and they want to talk to me
about the Daniel Léger case.

1:23:15.223 --> 1:23:17.124
Well, what have you got
to do with that?

1:23:17.258 --> 1:23:18.993
Well, I interviewed him,

1:23:19.127 --> 1:23:22.430
so they want me to testify
as a witness.

1:23:27.035 --> 1:23:29.671
I'm gonna go check
on the meat loaf.

1:23:38.246 --> 1:23:40.614
You lost both your jobs
because of this thing.

1:23:40.748 --> 1:23:43.151
Don't you think it's time
to just drop it?

1:23:43.284 --> 1:23:44.719
I'm not gonna drop it now.

1:23:44.852 --> 1:23:47.522
We just put our finger
on something-- No, you--

1:23:48.790 --> 1:23:50.425
I have never complained
about your work.

1:23:50.558 --> 1:23:52.193
Okay? I am proud
of what you do.

1:23:52.326 --> 1:23:53.561
I have always been proud.

1:23:53.694 --> 1:23:55.330
But you've got
to drop this thing.

1:23:55.463 --> 1:23:58.766
Well, this isn't my job.
This is a court investigation.

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:01.236
These people
attacked us.

1:24:03.337 --> 1:24:05.540
To be fair,
we don't know who attacked us.

1:24:05.673 --> 1:24:08.142
They weren't trying to hurt you.
They were trying to scare me,
as usual.

1:24:08.276 --> 1:24:11.846
We can't let these guys
change the way
we live our lives just because--

1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:13.414
Oh, my God.

1:24:14.348 --> 1:24:17.318
What? It obviously doesn't
matter what I say.

1:24:17.618 --> 1:24:19.587
Of course it matters
what you say.

1:24:20.221 --> 1:24:22.623
It's just that Léger
is out there on his own.

1:24:22.756 --> 1:24:25.727
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?
Leave him out there to rot?

1:24:28.029 --> 1:24:29.363
Come on.

1:24:29.997 --> 1:24:32.166
You can't save everybody.

1:24:32.300 --> 1:24:33.568
You have a daughter now.

1:24:34.669 --> 1:24:36.971
What if it was
our daughter, hmm?

1:24:37.105 --> 1:24:38.773
Out there. It's not.

1:24:38.907 --> 1:24:41.642
Well, what if it was,
and she was dying
in a Thai prison,

1:24:41.776 --> 1:24:43.778
and the government
had abandoned her?

1:24:43.911 --> 1:24:45.580
Like you are?

1:24:47.915 --> 1:24:50.818
This whole thing isn't
about Léger or our daughter.

1:24:50.951 --> 1:24:52.286
It's about you.

1:24:52.420 --> 1:24:54.989
But this guy isn't you.
Okay?

1:24:55.123 --> 1:24:57.725
When Social Services took
you away, you were a kid.
You were innocent.

1:24:57.859 --> 1:24:59.326
This guy's a criminal,
for Christ's sake.

1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:01.529
The government
fucked him over.

1:25:02.764 --> 1:25:05.666
I know what it feels like
to have the shit kicked
out of you every day

1:25:06.267 --> 1:25:09.671
and to wonder if anybody
is ever gonna come
look out for you.

1:25:10.905 --> 1:25:12.373
No one ever does.

1:25:12.941 --> 1:25:15.276
I hope you guys are hungry.

1:25:15.943 --> 1:25:17.779
It's comfort food.

1:25:20.748 --> 1:25:22.316
Usually, it gets
a bigger ovation

1:25:22.449 --> 1:25:24.752
when I arrive
with a meat loaf. [laughs]

1:25:27.088 --> 1:25:30.891
[announcer]
Our first big point
in this semifinal match.

1:25:31.025 --> 1:25:32.827
[announcer continues
on TV]

1:25:33.995 --> 1:25:37.432
It becomes balletic.
That is McEnroe magic
at its best.

1:25:37.565 --> 1:25:39.134
[snoring]

1:25:41.268 --> 1:25:43.671
[tennis ball
hitting rackets]

1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:48.142
[crowd groans] And that's a tough spot to hit,

1:25:48.275 --> 1:25:50.310
trying to get it
into that corner,

1:25:50.444 --> 1:25:52.313
the forehand of his opponent.

1:26:13.134 --> 1:26:15.503
[Michael in French]

1:26:58.746 --> 1:27:00.648
[Don]
You're not gonna believe this.
I asked for Léger's mug shot

1:27:00.781 --> 1:27:02.650
for the cash request
on the drug transaction.

1:27:02.784 --> 1:27:05.520
Yeah. C Division sent me this.

1:27:07.621 --> 1:27:09.157
What the hell is that?

1:27:09.290 --> 1:27:10.825
Robert Léger.

1:27:11.226 --> 1:27:13.093
We've been working
off the wrong record.

1:27:13.227 --> 1:27:14.629
No, I don't know.

1:27:14.762 --> 1:27:16.931
Our guy changes
his first name all the time.

1:27:17.064 --> 1:27:18.232
I've seen a long list.

1:27:18.632 --> 1:27:20.968
Besides,
the birth date's a match.

1:27:21.102 --> 1:27:22.803
Right. The name matches.

1:27:22.937 --> 1:27:24.872
The date and location
of birth matches.

1:27:25.005 --> 1:27:26.407
The mug shot doesn't.

1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:29.110
Well, C Division
sent the wrong photo.

1:27:29.510 --> 1:27:30.845
No, that's unlikely.

1:27:31.945 --> 1:27:33.481
I'll take care of it.

1:27:36.750 --> 1:27:39.153
[Cooper]
So, what's the story on this?

1:27:39.286 --> 1:27:44.258
Well, Daniel Léger exists in
the Social gSecurity data bank.

1:27:44.392 --> 1:27:46.894
Mm-hmm. He's got
a driver's license.

1:27:47.027 --> 1:27:49.930
He's from Quebec,
but he's got no criminal record.

1:27:50.063 --> 1:27:52.233
Hmm. And Robert Léger?

1:27:52.834 --> 1:27:55.836
[man] Robert Léger
and Daniel Léger are
two different people.

1:27:55.970 --> 1:28:00.441
And, uh, Robert Léger
is the fellow with
the criminal record.

1:28:00.574 --> 1:28:02.677
[Cooper] Okay. Thanks.

1:28:14.521 --> 1:28:17.325
Excuse me.
Do you know a Mr. Porn?

1:28:18.092 --> 1:28:19.727
Tuk-tuk driver,
Mr. Porn?

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:22.029
[speaking Thai]

1:28:22.162 --> 1:28:23.865
Over there? Thanks.

1:28:41.315 --> 1:28:43.084
Are you,
uh, Mr. Porn?

1:28:46.187 --> 1:28:47.755
Go sit with Al
for a bit.

1:28:47.889 --> 1:28:49.324
Yeah.

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:00.668
Can't sleep?

1:29:02.503 --> 1:29:04.672
I just hope
we didn't forget anything.

1:29:04.805 --> 1:29:07.408
Did you get all
the transaction cash we wanted?

1:29:07.541 --> 1:29:09.410
I got 60 grand.

1:29:09.543 --> 1:29:11.712
What about the mug shot problem?
Did you fix it?

1:29:11.846 --> 1:29:14.348
Everything is
so screwed up in Archives.

1:29:14.481 --> 1:29:17.184
I had to take
the surveillance pic of Léger

1:29:17.317 --> 1:29:19.487
and stick it in the file.

1:29:21.021 --> 1:29:22.790
Wait. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1:29:22.923 --> 1:29:27.528
So, we don't know if we have
the wrong criminal record?

1:29:27.661 --> 1:29:29.163
Well, did you call Quebec?

1:29:29.296 --> 1:29:31.031
I didn't have time.

1:29:31.165 --> 1:29:32.933
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:29:33.867 --> 1:29:36.870
That means it's possible our guy
doesn't even have a record.

1:29:37.004 --> 1:29:41.275
Well, who cares what he did
or he didn't do before?

1:29:41.909 --> 1:29:44.512
What we're after is
what he's doing right now.

1:29:44.645 --> 1:29:48.649
And right now, he's in Thailand,
working for us.

1:30:04.198 --> 1:30:05.633
There.

1:30:07.435 --> 1:30:08.435
My friends. Morning.

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:09.937
Welcome
to Thailand.

1:31:05.126 --> 1:31:06.860
These are fine men,
Sergeant Cooper.

1:31:06.994 --> 1:31:09.831
They'll be happy to assist you
during your operation.

1:31:22.476 --> 1:31:24.244
Oh, that's great.

1:31:25.345 --> 1:31:28.148
We're gonna need your men
on scene as backup.

1:31:28.282 --> 1:31:30.317
As soon as the transaction
is complete,

1:31:30.450 --> 1:31:32.753
we leave Thailand and
make our arrest in Canada.

1:31:32.886 --> 1:31:35.022
You arrest
your local source.

1:31:35.155 --> 1:31:36.857
How will you convict
the trafficker

1:31:36.991 --> 1:31:38.892
if he's not in possession
when you arrest him?

1:31:39.026 --> 1:31:40.594
No, he'll be
in possession.

1:31:40.728 --> 1:31:42.529
We're gonna arrest him
at Vancouver Airport

1:31:42.662 --> 1:31:44.098
once he gets his cut.

1:31:45.233 --> 1:31:46.667
I see.

1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:50.004
But, Sergeant Cooper,
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1:31:50.137 --> 1:31:51.372
Yeah, why?

1:31:51.505 --> 1:31:54.441
We can't allow any illegal
narcotic leaving our shores,

1:31:54.574 --> 1:31:57.077
even if it is
by Canadian police.

1:31:57.945 --> 1:32:00.114
What, higher?  Yeah. That's good.

1:32:16.663 --> 1:32:18.266
We gotta talk.

1:32:22.302 --> 1:32:23.870
All right. Yeah.

1:32:24.004 --> 1:32:26.173
[Don] I didn't speak
directly to the colonel,

1:32:26.306 --> 1:32:28.208
but the other guy said
it'd be fine. [Cooper] Oh, wait.

1:32:28.342 --> 1:32:31.512
You didn't think to check
on Thai narcotics law? What for?

1:32:31.645 --> 1:32:35.316
Because we're doing the fucking
operation in Thailand. Shut up, Al.

1:32:46.727 --> 1:32:48.429
-Don't tell me
we're packing up.
-Oh, come on.

1:32:48.562 --> 1:32:49.864
No.

1:32:50.564 --> 1:32:51.799
We're not packing up.

1:32:52.399 --> 1:32:56.737
We are gonna arrest
Léger here, in Bangkok.

1:32:56.871 --> 1:32:58.705
Frank, we do that,

1:32:58.839 --> 1:33:00.975
we are never getting
Léger out of Thailand.

1:33:01.108 --> 1:33:03.844
Bullshit. He's our suspect.
We can do what we want with him.

1:33:05.279 --> 1:33:07.782
[muffled arguing]

1:33:10.650 --> 1:33:13.053
Fuck the Thai government.
Then we make it look like
an escape.

1:33:13.187 --> 1:33:14.989
Our guy gets away from us,
he flies back to Canada,--

1:33:15.122 --> 1:33:16.757
Do you know what the fuck
you're talking about?

1:33:16.890 --> 1:33:18.793
Fuck yourself, fat man! [shushes]

1:33:23.096 --> 1:33:24.832
[knocking]

1:33:30.871 --> 1:33:32.306
Okay, let's go.

1:33:53.426 --> 1:33:54.862
Come on in.

1:33:54.995 --> 1:33:56.897
You're early.
Everything all right?

1:33:57.031 --> 1:33:59.867
Yeah, well, body clock
is all fucked up.

1:34:00.001 --> 1:34:01.135
Yeah?

1:34:01.736 --> 1:34:02.770
This is
my friend Porn.

1:34:02.903 --> 1:34:04.671
Porn. Dig your name, man.

1:34:05.172 --> 1:34:08.442
Porn, this is, uh,
Frank, Al and Don.

1:34:08.575 --> 1:34:09.910
[speaking Thai]

1:34:10.044 --> 1:34:12.312
Well, come in, come in.

1:34:13.147 --> 1:34:15.682
-You want a beer?
-No, I'm good. Thanks.

1:34:15.816 --> 1:34:18.251
I'll, uh, leave
you guys to discuss.

1:34:18.385 --> 1:34:21.755
Oh, no. No, we need you
as an interpreter.

1:34:21.889 --> 1:34:23.156
Oh, he--
he speaks English.

1:34:23.290 --> 1:34:26.894
Well-- I think it's best
if you stay.

1:34:30.931 --> 1:34:33.267
All right,
I'll take that beer then.

1:34:34.035 --> 1:34:36.970
[Cooper] All right, so,
uh, Daniel here,

1:34:37.103 --> 1:34:40.141
-he tells us that
you can help us out.
-Thanks.

1:34:40.608 --> 1:34:41.575
Yeah.

1:34:41.708 --> 1:34:43.077
Okay, how much for a kilo?

1:34:44.344 --> 1:34:45.746
Thirteen.

1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:47.815
We'll give you nine.

1:34:48.248 --> 1:34:49.182
How many?

1:34:49.316 --> 1:34:51.352
Kilos? Ten.

1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:54.621
Five for ten.

1:34:54.754 --> 1:34:56.690
Five for ten...

1:34:56.823 --> 1:35:00.494
I think he means five kilos
at $10,000 each.

1:35:00.861 --> 1:35:03.597
Do you have, uh,
$50,000 here?

1:35:03.730 --> 1:35:05.166
Oh, yeah, you betcha.

1:35:09.869 --> 1:35:11.171
You want to count it?

1:35:11.305 --> 1:35:12.406
Oh, uh--

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.009
I believe you guys.

1:35:15.142 --> 1:35:16.577
Porn, you okay with this?

1:35:16.710 --> 1:35:18.079
Yeah.

1:35:18.879 --> 1:35:20.314
[Cooper] Okay.

1:35:20.447 --> 1:35:24.118
So, where do you
wanna do this?

1:35:24.251 --> 1:35:25.952
You have to
meet my sister.

1:35:26.086 --> 1:35:28.589
Maybe you gotta marry her
as part of the deal.

1:35:29.290 --> 1:35:33.260
My sister will decide
where to do this, or no deal.

1:35:34.328 --> 1:35:37.531
Well, see,
we've got the money.

1:35:38.098 --> 1:35:40.734
So, uh, we'll decide,

1:35:40.868 --> 1:35:42.369
or no deal.

1:35:44.571 --> 1:35:46.006
Happy to meeting you.

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.008
Hey, Porn, come on. Porn!

1:35:48.142 --> 1:35:52.146
Hey! What kind of
half-ass stunt was that?

1:35:52.980 --> 1:35:55.582
Is this what
we came here for,

1:35:55.716 --> 1:35:58.118
to meet this
small-time loser?

1:35:58.552 --> 1:36:01.322
If this deal goes south...

1:36:02.956 --> 1:36:05.326
it ain't gonna end good
for you, I'll tell you.

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:07.862
[door slams shut]

1:36:08.528 --> 1:36:10.498
[Don] Daniel, relax.

1:36:11.331 --> 1:36:12.633
We'll be fine.

1:36:12.766 --> 1:36:14.768
Besides, you, uh,
you got two days

1:36:14.901 --> 1:36:16.771
to make this
deal happen, right?

1:36:20.207 --> 1:36:21.275
Uh-huh.

1:36:38.124 --> 1:36:39.794
I'll be back tomorrow.

1:36:40.794 --> 1:36:42.396
I love you.

1:36:42.530 --> 1:36:43.931
Yeah.

1:37:05.052 --> 1:37:06.820
Hey, Porn. [speaking Thai]

1:37:07.253 --> 1:37:11.524
I don't like this place, man.
Let's just go back and
convince your sister, all right?

1:37:11.658 --> 1:37:13.760
[sighs] My sister's out.

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:16.596
She don't trust
your friend.

1:37:16.730 --> 1:37:18.599
She didn't
even meet them.

1:37:18.732 --> 1:37:22.235
Yeah, she go to sit in
the hotel and look at them.

1:37:22.369 --> 1:37:24.737
And she said
they were police.

1:37:24.871 --> 1:37:27.975
Well, your sister's
got a problem,
'cause they're not police.

1:37:41.421 --> 1:37:44.325
Don't be scared.
This is a safe place here.

1:37:44.959 --> 1:37:47.962
Come to see my friend.
Good friend, okay?

1:37:51.398 --> 1:37:52.967
[Al] Can I ask you something?

1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:56.469
Where the fuck did you guys
find this junkie-ass loser?

1:37:57.237 --> 1:37:58.572
I think he's full
of shit too.

1:37:58.706 --> 1:38:00.207
Right?

1:38:02.876 --> 1:38:04.378
Who's full of shit?

1:38:07.615 --> 1:38:09.683
No, I'm asking you.
Who's full of shit?

1:38:09.816 --> 1:38:11.018
The junkie asshole.

1:38:11.151 --> 1:38:12.986
He just--
He doesn't feel right.

1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:15.589
He doesn't feel right?
That's good police work.

1:38:15.722 --> 1:38:18.124
Is that what they
teach you at the academy?

1:38:18.925 --> 1:38:21.095
They teach us
to trust our gut.

1:38:21.595 --> 1:38:22.930
Let me tell you something.

1:38:23.063 --> 1:38:26.700
E Division, they gave us
a million-dollar budget

1:38:26.833 --> 1:38:27.867
for this operation.

1:38:28.301 --> 1:38:29.903
Now, does your gut want
to be part of a team

1:38:30.037 --> 1:38:33.474
that spends that kind of budget
and brings back zero results?

1:38:35.575 --> 1:38:36.677
Boulder?

1:38:37.544 --> 1:38:39.279
No, sir. So,

1:38:39.413 --> 1:38:42.215
we follow
the junkie asshole's lead,

1:38:42.349 --> 1:38:44.351
and everyone shut the fuck up.

1:38:48.888 --> 1:38:51.057
Nipa and Pimpan?

1:38:51.190 --> 1:38:52.826
Porn got these girls?

1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:56.763
They can do it outside,
in an alley next to
an old cinema.

1:38:56.896 --> 1:38:58.132
How much can they get?

1:38:58.265 --> 1:39:00.534
-Two kilos.
-[scoffing] Christ.

1:39:00.667 --> 1:39:02.869
Are you fucking kidding me?
We didn't come all
this way to Thailand

1:39:03.003 --> 1:39:05.973
-for two goddamn kilos.
-Hey, if you can
do better, go ahead.

1:39:06.106 --> 1:39:08.174
All right, look,
our flight leaves tomorrow.

1:39:08.308 --> 1:39:10.077
Can they do
the deal tonight?

1:39:24.858 --> 1:39:26.293
This is, uh...

1:39:27.093 --> 1:39:29.829
Nipa and, uh, Pimpan.

1:39:29.963 --> 1:39:31.698
Jesus. How old are they?

1:39:31.832 --> 1:39:33.534
Fucking Asians.
Who knows?

1:39:34.001 --> 1:39:35.436
We go?

1:39:36.303 --> 1:39:39.306
-Have they got it?
-Yeah, they have it.
No worries.

1:40:14.508 --> 1:40:15.542
Is this it?

1:40:20.013 --> 1:40:21.281
We getting off here?

1:40:58.619 --> 1:40:59.719
Who's this?

1:40:59.853 --> 1:41:01.555
My brother.

1:41:03.189 --> 1:41:04.558
My brother
have it.

1:41:06.393 --> 1:41:08.428
You go and
see it, yeah?

1:41:08.562 --> 1:41:11.965
No, no. Daniel,
tell him to get off the bike.

1:41:12.433 --> 1:41:14.134
I don't know them
any more than you do.

1:41:14.268 --> 1:41:16.670
All right, tell him
to get off the bike.

1:41:17.370 --> 1:41:19.139
Al, get in the back.

1:41:19.272 --> 1:41:22.142
We're gonna do the deal
in the truck.

1:41:23.676 --> 1:41:25.912
Come on, tell him
to get off the bike.

1:41:26.512 --> 1:41:29.616
I'm not gonna risk him
tearing off down the street.

1:41:32.952 --> 1:41:34.555
[speaking Thai]

1:41:43.396 --> 1:41:44.398
[speaking Thai]

1:41:44.531 --> 1:41:46.300
[in English] In the back.

1:41:49.369 --> 1:41:51.238
[speaking Thai]

1:41:56.410 --> 1:41:57.677
[Al] All right,
open the bag.

1:41:57.811 --> 1:42:00.480
No, you show money. Open the bag first.

1:42:00.613 --> 1:42:03.383
You need to show money first. I need to see what's
in the bag.

1:42:03.516 --> 1:42:06.453
-[Nipa] Hey, show money now!
-No, hold your horses.

1:42:06.586 --> 1:42:09.256
-[Cooper] You see the drugs?
-Open the fucking bag!

1:42:09.389 --> 1:42:11.725
[all shouting]

1:42:12.125 --> 1:42:13.359
Give me!

1:42:13.827 --> 1:42:15.863
-[Nipa] Show me the bag!
-Don't touch it.

1:42:17.030 --> 1:42:18.298
[groans]

1:42:21.701 --> 1:42:24.671
Don't move.
Officer assistance!

1:42:25.872 --> 1:42:30.444
-Hey!
-[Cooper] Hey, James,
he's coming at you!

1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:35.782
[Cooper shouting]

1:42:36.617 --> 1:42:39.219
-Al!
-Don't fucking move!

1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:42.189
[Cooper] Stop the truck!

1:42:44.291 --> 1:42:45.759
Stop!

1:42:47.494 --> 1:42:50.297
-Stop!
-We are police! Police!

1:42:52.832 --> 1:42:55.235
[banging on window] [Cooper] Stop!

1:42:56.369 --> 1:42:57.838
[gunshot]

1:43:00.206 --> 1:43:01.208
Holy-- Shots fired!

1:43:01.341 --> 1:43:03.043
[officers shouting]

1:43:03.176 --> 1:43:04.644
Man down!

1:43:04.777 --> 1:43:06.079
[grunting]

1:43:06.212 --> 1:43:07.347
[screams]

1:43:07.481 --> 1:43:10.184
Okay. Stop the truck! Stop!

1:43:13.053 --> 1:43:14.521
Jesus Christ.

1:43:15.254 --> 1:43:17.357
[shouting]

1:43:18.491 --> 1:43:21.428
Man down! Man down!

1:43:23.696 --> 1:43:26.500
Check him.
Check him, check him!

1:43:28.001 --> 1:43:30.737
Call an ambulance!
Man down!

1:43:31.671 --> 1:43:32.973
[grunts]

1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:35.375
You okay?

1:43:35.508 --> 1:43:37.477
Yeah, I'm all right.

1:43:39.379 --> 1:43:40.914
[groans]

1:43:44.117 --> 1:43:46.820
[groaning]

1:44:12.211 --> 1:44:13.914
[no audio]

1:44:41.975 --> 1:44:43.477
[door opens]

1:44:48.214 --> 1:44:49.783
We'll be right back.

1:44:57.891 --> 1:45:01.561
Look, I know this accident
was terrible,

1:45:01.695 --> 1:45:04.965
but we need to move now
if we want to stay
in front of this.

1:45:05.098 --> 1:45:09.202
-What?
-If what really happened here
reaches the public,

1:45:09.336 --> 1:45:11.071
you're all fucked.

1:45:12.238 --> 1:45:14.641
[sighs] And so am I.

1:45:56.783 --> 1:45:58.951
This is Norman.
Leave a message.

1:45:59.085 --> 1:46:00.353
[beeps]

1:46:00.486 --> 1:46:02.321
Norman... [clears throat]

1:46:02.955 --> 1:46:04.958
I changed my flight.
I'm coming home tonight.

1:46:05.091 --> 1:46:08.795
Uh, take the girls with you
to the studio, will you? I--

1:46:10.830 --> 1:46:13.166
Just keep them safe
till I get back. Thanks.

1:46:13.733 --> 1:46:16.103
Mr. Malarek?
We're ready for you.

1:46:37.690 --> 1:46:40.127
[man speaking Thai]

1:46:47.134 --> 1:46:48.735
Ma'am, what's
he saying?

1:46:49.569 --> 1:46:50.937
[shushes]

1:46:51.471 --> 1:46:52.505
He said you were...

1:46:52.639 --> 1:46:53.973
[indistinct]

1:46:54.106 --> 1:46:55.409
[shushes]

1:46:56.743 --> 1:46:58.511
The policemen's
stories contradict.

1:46:58.645 --> 1:47:01.914
They are bringing in someone
to give the official
version of the arrest.

1:47:02.048 --> 1:47:03.650
What?

1:47:25.438 --> 1:47:27.974
[man speaking Thai]

1:47:28.107 --> 1:47:31.611
I may swear to God
all my statement will be true.

1:47:32.445 --> 1:47:33.480
I swear.

1:47:33.613 --> 1:47:35.148
Mr. Malarek.
Robert McDonald.

1:47:35.281 --> 1:47:36.483
Thanks for coming in. Yeah.

1:47:36.616 --> 1:47:38.919
This way. Glad I could be here.

1:47:40.119 --> 1:47:42.989
[Cooper] Mr. Léger
was convicted of assault,

1:47:43.123 --> 1:47:44.924
possession of narcotics

1:47:45.057 --> 1:47:50.530
and importation and trafficking
of narcotics in Canada.

1:47:51.597 --> 1:47:54.867
He was to receive, um,

1:47:55.001 --> 1:47:58.537
10% of the drugs
and I believe $5,000...

1:47:58.671 --> 1:48:00.640
[voice fades out]

1:48:09.682 --> 1:48:14.454
[man speaking Thai]

1:48:14.587 --> 1:48:17.557
Your Honor, there's something
I wish I could tell the court.

1:48:18.291 --> 1:48:21.461
This Canadian operation
in Thailand was illegal.

1:48:21.761 --> 1:48:23.930
According to Canadian law,

1:48:24.063 --> 1:48:27.567
the Canadian police
did not have the right
to pay for my plane ticket

1:48:27.701 --> 1:48:29.435
for me to come here
and do this job for them.

1:48:29.569 --> 1:48:31.037
[man translating into Thai]

1:48:31.171 --> 1:48:32.105
And--

1:48:32.238 --> 1:48:33.639
They paid for everything.

1:48:33.773 --> 1:48:36.443
The plane tickets, the hotels,
expenses, everything.

1:48:36.576 --> 1:48:38.778
Daniel Léger told you this? Yes.

1:48:38.912 --> 1:48:41.214
Why would the federal
narc agents do that?

1:48:41.347 --> 1:48:43.616
They know it leads directly
to illegal entrapment.

1:48:43.750 --> 1:48:46.953
You'll have to ask them.
All I know is Léger didn't
have enough cash for rent.

1:48:47.086 --> 1:48:48.622
He didn't even
have a bank account.

1:48:49.155 --> 1:48:50.923
And more importantly,
Your Honor,

1:48:51.057 --> 1:48:54.660
the police from my country
lied to you in this court

1:48:54.794 --> 1:48:57.230
and to the Thai police
when they came here.

1:48:57.364 --> 1:48:59.532
They have said that
I have a criminal record,

1:48:59.666 --> 1:49:01.034
which is not true.

1:49:01.167 --> 1:49:02.168
And I'm sure--

1:49:02.301 --> 1:49:04.037
[men speaking Thai]

1:49:04.170 --> 1:49:07.106
I've been an investigative
journalist for 15 years.

1:49:07.239 --> 1:49:10.544
I make a few phone calls,
I find out if someone
is connected.

1:49:11.511 --> 1:49:13.580
What I found out
on Léger is unanimous.

1:49:13.713 --> 1:49:15.214
He's a small-time junkie.

1:49:15.348 --> 1:49:18.618
In our country's criminal world,
he's a nobody.

1:49:18.752 --> 1:49:20.353
And I can get proof of that!

1:49:20.487 --> 1:49:23.056
If I'm allowed to contact
my country's authorities,

1:49:23.189 --> 1:49:25.057
I'm sure I can get
a letter confirming

1:49:25.191 --> 1:49:27.660
that I do not have
a criminal record.

1:49:27.793 --> 1:49:29.563
Laos, Myanmar and Thailand

1:49:29.696 --> 1:49:32.498
export over 200 metric tons
of heroin each year.

1:49:32.632 --> 1:49:36.536
Operation Goliath
ended up stopping
a transaction of two kilos.

1:49:36.669 --> 1:49:39.805
So, yes, it's possible
the Thais would set up
a tiny sting like this.

1:49:39.939 --> 1:49:41.874
But in my opinion,
it's completely ridiculous.

1:49:42.008 --> 1:49:44.244
They made threats to me.

1:49:44.377 --> 1:49:48.148
[men speaking Thai]

1:49:49.915 --> 1:49:51.518
But, Your Honor,
I have to--

1:49:51.651 --> 1:49:54.788
[men continue
speaking in Thai]

1:50:05.798 --> 1:50:08.802
[Robert] Do you think
he could've organized
this transaction?

1:50:17.177 --> 1:50:18.244
Yeah.

1:50:18.377 --> 1:50:20.613
In the case number 635412,

1:50:20.747 --> 1:50:22.949
Thailand v. Daniel Léger,

1:50:23.482 --> 1:50:27.487
Judge Wanian finds the defendant
guilty of co-possession,

1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:29.622
along with Nipa Seangtong,

1:50:29.755 --> 1:50:32.559
Pimpan Seangtong
and Pracha Seangtong,

1:50:32.692 --> 1:50:35.261
of more than
200 grams of heroin.

1:50:35.394 --> 1:50:40.933
Therefore,
the defendant's sentence
is death by execution.

1:50:41.634 --> 1:50:43.736
The court will now
give the defendant

1:50:43.870 --> 1:50:45.905
a chance to change his plea.

1:50:46.806 --> 1:50:50.276
Does the defendant
wish to change his plea?

1:50:58.050 --> 1:50:59.318
Yes.

1:50:59.552 --> 1:51:01.254
What is your plea?

1:51:02.755 --> 1:51:04.190
Guilty.

1:51:05.492 --> 1:51:10.263
The sentence is
therefore changed
to 100 years of imprisonment.

1:51:14.667 --> 1:51:17.337
You've done a good thing,
Mr. Malarek.

1:51:17.470 --> 1:51:20.540
Without you, Léger
wouldn't stand a chance
against those guys.

1:51:20.673 --> 1:51:22.375
And he stands
a chance now?

1:51:22.508 --> 1:51:25.611
Those officers broke
nearly every procedure
and regulation there is.

1:51:25.745 --> 1:51:29.082
Let's hope you can move fast.
The average prisoner
doesn't last 10 years in there.

1:51:29.215 --> 1:51:31.051
Half of that
for a Westerner.

1:51:31.717 --> 1:51:33.286
This is my priority.

1:51:33.986 --> 1:51:35.688
Thanks, man. Yeah.

1:51:35.821 --> 1:51:37.290
Take care.

1:51:37.423 --> 1:51:39.025
Good luck!

1:51:39.159 --> 1:51:40.927
[door opens]

1:51:42.662 --> 1:51:44.164
[whispering] Hey.

1:51:45.898 --> 1:51:48.201
Uh, she's-- she's gone.

1:51:50.603 --> 1:51:52.071
What do you mean,
she's gone?

1:51:52.204 --> 1:51:54.773
I-I got your message
and came home,

1:51:54.907 --> 1:51:56.209
but there was
no one here.

1:51:56.342 --> 1:51:58.011
She-- Sh-She's gone.

1:52:09.389 --> 1:52:10.790
Anna?

1:52:17.230 --> 1:52:18.798
[sighs]

1:52:19.231 --> 1:52:22.202
[beeping]

1:52:22.935 --> 1:52:25.238
[line ringing]

1:52:25.371 --> 1:52:26.539
[ringing]

1:52:26.673 --> 1:52:27.974
Hello?

1:52:28.107 --> 1:52:30.443
Denise, put Anna
on the phone, please.

1:52:30.576 --> 1:52:32.045
She's not here.

1:52:33.679 --> 1:52:34.948
Do you know where she is?

1:52:35.081 --> 1:52:37.416
No. Don't fuck with me, Denise.

1:52:37.549 --> 1:52:40.286
If you know where she is,
I need to know now. All right?

1:52:40.419 --> 1:52:43.790
I'm really scared that
something's happened to them. She'll call you.

1:52:44.557 --> 1:52:46.526
[dial tone]

1:53:00.339 --> 1:53:01.507
Happy see you.

1:53:01.641 --> 1:53:03.409
Yeah, bet you are.

1:53:05.044 --> 1:53:06.345
What are those?

1:53:06.479 --> 1:53:07.981
Guard left them for you.

1:53:19.125 --> 1:53:20.527
This is from my mother.

1:53:24.797 --> 1:53:27.000
Those fuckers
kept these from me?

1:53:30.303 --> 1:53:31.504
What's this?

1:53:34.940 --> 1:53:37.143
"Public Complaints Commission."

1:53:38.478 --> 1:53:41.447
They're investigating
my case back home.

1:53:41.581 --> 1:53:44.250
Holy shit!
They're coming here to see me.

1:53:44.384 --> 1:53:46.452
Lucky. Lucky you.

1:53:46.586 --> 1:53:48.087
Shit, shit, shit.

1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:50.189
I need to sign this form
against the federal police

1:53:50.323 --> 1:53:52.091
and send it
back to them.

1:53:52.625 --> 1:53:54.193
Need contact
in mail room.

1:53:54.327 --> 1:53:56.428
Yeah, no shit.
I'm fucked!

1:53:56.929 --> 1:53:58.965
I don't have any money
for a contact.

1:53:59.732 --> 1:54:02.502
Already got good contact.

1:54:03.335 --> 1:54:04.503
Who?

1:54:04.904 --> 1:54:06.339
In the yard.

1:54:06.472 --> 1:54:09.575
Back, back, left.
Behind the kitchen.

1:54:10.443 --> 1:54:14.580
You see Tuan.
He high, not working.

1:54:15.214 --> 1:54:18.117
Tuan. The junkie.
He delivered this?

1:54:19.518 --> 1:54:23.389
Holy shit, you fat-ass
Buddhist motherfucker.

1:54:26.759 --> 1:54:28.995
[beeping]

1:54:32.865 --> 1:54:35.334
[phone ringing] [inhales sharply]

1:54:35.735 --> 1:54:37.469
Mmm. Hello?

1:54:37.770 --> 1:54:39.339
Anna?

1:54:42.508 --> 1:54:44.110
Anna, is that you?

1:54:49.115 --> 1:54:51.817
Okay, sweetheart,
I know you don't want
to talk to me right now,

1:54:51.951 --> 1:54:53.887
and I-- I get it.

1:54:54.987 --> 1:54:56.456
I, uh...

1:54:57.757 --> 1:54:59.592
I just...

1:55:02.161 --> 1:55:06.132
You and our daughter
come first.

1:55:08.868 --> 1:55:11.304
I don't care about TV shows

1:55:11.437 --> 1:55:15.074
or newspapers
or investigations

1:55:15.207 --> 1:55:20.146
or anything else nearly as much
as I care about you two.

1:55:24.149 --> 1:55:26.185
Let me prove that to you.

1:55:29.054 --> 1:55:32.492
And then, and only then...

1:55:35.161 --> 1:55:37.397
maybe you'll let me
save the world.

1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:45.038
Maybe just a little,
itty-bitty part of the world.

1:55:46.905 --> 1:55:48.441
[chuckles]

1:55:52.044 --> 1:55:53.513
Anna?

1:55:54.813 --> 1:55:56.582
We're at my sister's.

1:55:57.850 --> 1:55:59.319
I knew that.

1:56:00.118 --> 1:56:01.654
Are you coming?

1:56:03.122 --> 1:56:04.557
Right away.

1:56:04.691 --> 1:56:08.227
[man singing in Thai on PA]

1:56:16.702 --> 1:56:18.304
[speaking Thai]

1:56:30.916 --> 1:56:33.519
[in Thai]

1:57:14.694 --> 1:57:16.229
Okay, I think I'm ready.

1:57:20.198 --> 1:57:23.736
Right around here?
Make sure you get as much
of the background as possible.

1:57:23.869 --> 1:57:25.270
Can you count me in?

1:57:26.004 --> 1:57:28.174
[cameraman]
Three, two, one.

1:57:28.307 --> 1:57:30.276
It's a big day
for Daniel Léger,

1:57:30.409 --> 1:57:32.378
the Canadian man
who was wrongly accused

1:57:32.511 --> 1:57:35.548
of smuggling heroin
in Thailand in 1989.

1:57:35.681 --> 1:57:39.118
His plane landed on home soil
just a few moments ago.

1:57:39.618 --> 1:57:41.353
He was escorted off by officers,

1:57:41.486 --> 1:57:43.456
who will then accompany him
to a Canadian prison,

1:57:43.589 --> 1:57:45.725
where he will finally
be released on parole.

1:57:45.858 --> 1:57:47.926
Léger, who beat his heroin
addiction on his own,

1:57:48.060 --> 1:57:50.429
was able to mount a defense
against the federal government

1:57:50.562 --> 1:57:53.833
from his cell in Bangkok by
gathering thousands of documents

1:57:53.966 --> 1:57:56.769
through the public access
to government information
in Ottawa.

1:57:56.902 --> 1:57:59.471
Léger was able to
secure himself a transfer

1:57:59.604 --> 1:58:02.308
to serve his time
in his country.

1:58:02.675 --> 1:58:04.143
Actually, right now,

1:58:04.276 --> 1:58:07.946
Daniel Léger is being
brought from the terminal.

1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:10.183
[whispering] In on him.

1:58:22.295 --> 1:58:24.230
Welcome home,
Mr. Léger.

1:58:24.730 --> 1:58:25.997
Thank you.

1:58:26.732 --> 1:58:29.302
I notice that no one
is here to meet you.

1:58:29.802 --> 1:58:31.137
I, uh...

1:58:31.737 --> 1:58:34.907
I lost both my parents
while I was in prison.

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:36.609
Ah. I'm really
sorry to hear that.

1:58:36.742 --> 1:58:38.977
Hey, guys, do you mind
just giving us two seconds?

1:58:39.111 --> 1:58:41.580
Two seconds, please?
Thank you. Uh...

1:58:42.080 --> 1:58:46.218
It took great courage for you
to be able to build your case
from a prison cell in Bangkok.

1:58:46.352 --> 1:58:48.254
How did you manage
to do that?

1:58:49.888 --> 1:58:51.456
Zen Buddhism.

1:58:52.524 --> 1:58:54.894
Do you know what happened
to the federal police

1:58:55.027 --> 1:58:56.829
that, uh,
that arrested you?

1:58:58.163 --> 1:58:59.799
No, no idea. No?

1:58:59.932 --> 1:59:02.501
They were given medals
for their work
on Operation Goliath

1:59:02.634 --> 1:59:04.403
and they were
awarded desk jobs.

1:59:04.536 --> 1:59:06.739
How does that
make you feel?

1:59:06.872 --> 1:59:11.210
I mean, do you feel
like you've been cheated out of
eight years of your life?

1:59:13.779 --> 1:59:15.448
Obviously, there's no words
that can describe

1:59:15.581 --> 1:59:17.182
what Daniel Léger is-- Grateful.

1:59:17.816 --> 1:59:21.587
You ask me how I feel.
I feel grateful.

1:59:25.191 --> 1:59:26.759
Thank you, Victor.

1:59:29.995 --> 1:59:31.564
Did you get that?

1:59:36.969 --> 1:59:38.538
And cut.
