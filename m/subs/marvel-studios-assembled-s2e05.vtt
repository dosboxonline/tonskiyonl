RICHIE PALMER: <i>Echo is a character</i>
<i>we've been excited about</i>

00:11.636 --> 00:13.096
<i>for a long time in Marvel Studios.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:17.350
It just felt like the right time
to introduce a new corner of the universe.

STEPHEN BROUSSARD: <i>In the comics,</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:25.734
<i>this character was first introduced</i>
<i>in the world of Daredevil,</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:28.445
dealing with Matt Murdock
and with Kingpin,

00:28.528 --> 00:30.822
<i>and that kind of street-level crime.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:34.784
Much more gritty, urban,
as opposed to outer space or Asgard.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.162
That's kind of the space
she had occupied in the comics.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.290
<i>It's the space we meet her in</i>
<i>in the</i> Hawkeye <i>series.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:44.669
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:44.753 --> 00:47.338
From there, there was so much
we could do with the character.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.717
There was so much potential,
many new characters we could introduce.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.556
SYDNEY FREELAND: <i>On</i> Echo,

00:56.639 --> 00:59.893
<i>one of the things that was important to me</i>
<i>was authenticity, you know,</i>

00:59.976 --> 01:03.646

from an authentic standpoint.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.148
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:06.941 --> 01:08.902
What we wanted to do from the beginning

01:08.985 --> 01:12.030
<i>is show a world that people</i>
<i>may not be familiar with.</i>

01:12.113 --> 01:15.658
But then open up our arms and say,
"Hey, we're actually not that different."

01:17.827 --> 01:19.537
We tried to do as much in-camera
as possible.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.248
<i>We wanted it to feel like</i>
<i>the most grounded thing in the MCU.</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:26.377
You get introduced
to this Native American world.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.796
Extremely emotional.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.316
FREELAND: <i>In </i>Hawkeye,
<i>Maya Lopez is a villain.</i>

01:49.692 --> 01:53.571
And that was super exciting to me
'cause it wasn't about, like,

01:53.655 --> 01:56.199
we weren't trying to turn her
into Captain America.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.785
We weren't trying to turn her
into this noble person.

01:58.868 --> 02:01.204
Awesome. (CHUCKLES)

02:02.914 --> 02:05.291
FREELAND: <i>It was like,</i>
<i>"Let's embrace those flaws"</i>

02:05.375 --> 02:08.503
<i>and it really created, like,</i>
<i>a full, complicated,</i>

02:08.586 --> 02:12.757
complex narrative and character
that we could build our series on.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.887
BROUSSARD: <i>It's just a really</i>
<i>fascinating character that</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:21.808
flees the events of <i>Hawkeye</i>
and goes back home.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.858
<i>So it's very much like</i>
<i>a prodigal daughter story,</i>

02:29.941 --> 02:33.528
<i>and it's about her going back home</i>
<i>and figuring out who she is.</i>

02:33.611 --> 02:35.655
Is she a criminal mastermind?

02:35.738 --> 02:40.577
Is she going to stay on this path
of being on the wrong side of the law?

02:40.660 --> 02:44.706
Or is she going to reconnect with
a family and a community and a culture?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.002
<i>It's a unique synthesis,</i>

02:49.544 --> 02:52.672
<i>and so we've sort of put</i>
<i>the entire point of view of the series</i>

02:52.755 --> 02:56.801
<i>in the hands of this incredible actress</i>
<i>named Alaqua Cox.</i>

02:58.428 --> 03:00.471
Alaqua is such a presence as Maya Lopez

03:00.555 --> 03:02.098
<i>that when she showed up on</i> Hawkeye,

03:02.182 --> 03:05.143
<i>it was the first thing she's ever done,</i>
<i>and she commanded the screen.</i>

03:05.226 --> 03:08.188
<i>Her presence really just</i>
<i>drew you in on that show.</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.274
<i>This character, Maya Lopez,</i>

03:11.357 --> 03:14.277
<i>she's a more obscure character</i>
<i>in the comics that is deaf</i>

03:14.360 --> 03:16.487
<i>and a young Native American woman.</i>

03:27.415 --> 03:29.500
With the <i>Hawkeye </i>series,
we wanted to make sure

03:29.584 --> 03:33.838
that we were looking into the deaf
community to find that actress.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.049
And we're looking
to the Native American culture

03:36.132 --> 03:39.344
<i>to make sure that we can get</i>
<i>a deaf Native American actress.</i>

03:39.427 --> 03:41.679
<i>Now, when you put both of them</i>
<i>together that way,</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:43.139
it's a massive undertaking

03:43.223 --> 03:46.184
to be able to find
the perfect person to play Maya Lopez.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.729
<i>We pored through so many tapes</i>

03:49.812 --> 03:55.360
<i>and Alaqua, who came from Wisconsin,</i>
<i>who is Native American, who's deaf,</i>

03:55.443 --> 03:58.196
was just the perfect person
to play this character.

VINCENT D'ONOFRIO: <i>Alaqua's amazing.</i>
<i>She's like a natural.</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:18.841
She handles this
emotional stuff really well

04:18.925 --> 04:23.137

<i>You know, her body is calm,</i>
<i>her aura is calm.</i>

<i>That is challenging for even</i>
<i>the most experienced actor.</i>

05:52.810 --> 05:56.522
So, we knew that we had
to put in place a support system

05:56.606 --> 05:59.984

<i>I wanted to look like I know</i>

I've learned that I talk faster
than I move my hands.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.784
So for me, it's to take it down a notch
and also make it believable

08:54.867 --> 08:57.537
and also have the emotions
going when we're acting.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.497

CATRIONA McKENZIE:
<i>When it comes to ASL, it's very kinetic.</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:24.397
All expressed through face and hands,
and I love that.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.856
<i>It was like poetry.</i>

09:37.243 --> 09:39.996
FREELAND: <i>In being able to study ASL</i>
<i>and take lessons,</i>

09:40.079 --> 09:43.791
<i>one of the things that became apparent</i>
<i>is that the hands are an extension</i>

09:43.874 --> 09:46.043
of one's emotion and one's expression.

09:49.630 --> 09:53.134
Anyone from the deaf community or ASL
community can completely override me.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.262
It's not my lived experience,
but the, um...

09:56.345 --> 10:00.308
My interpretation was that
it's like the hands are the text

10:00.391 --> 10:02.643
<i>and the face is the subtext, right?</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:05.479
So you really need
those two things together

10:05.563 --> 10:08.858
to be able to get an idea
of what a person's feeling.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.319
<i>We built our entire visual language</i>
<i>with that in mind.</i>

10:11.402 --> 10:15.364
So, for example,
a close-up on our show is this.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.452
<i>Specifically so we can see Maya's face</i>
<i>but we can also see her hands sign.</i>

10:19.535 --> 10:22.204
So, across the board, our visual language

10:22.288 --> 10:25.458

<i>of existing in the world.</i>

10:52.026 --> 10:53.611

<i>told them about what we were doing,</i>

and started having
informal creative meetings together.

12:38.883 --> 12:43.596

<i>"So we can hopefully do it</i>
<i>in a more authentic manner."</i>

<i>And so I think, initially,</i>
<i>they were kind of taken aback, too.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:08.204
The Choctaws were like, "What is this?
What's your agenda?"

<i>because, as Indigenous people,</i>
<i>a huge reason why we've been so resilient</i>

We call them long houses or team houses.

16:20.896 --> 16:23.565

a sort of mud-based plaster.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.702

is a sort of thatching.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.612
He's nothing like the character
that he portrays,

17:51.695 --> 17:54.239

You threw it in my face.

Early on, I'm allowed into the meetings
when it comes to the development,

18:39.159 --> 18:42.496

-Okay.

<i>his interpretation of Kingpin.</i>

and I can't look away.

19:44.641 --> 19:48.145
You know, that was always something
that from our first rehearsal I mentioned,

19:48.228 --> 19:51.231
is that, "Listen, no matter what happens,
Kingpin loves Maya,

19:51.315 --> 19:52.691
"and Maya loves Kingpin."

19:53.275 --> 19:56.486

19:58.322 --> 20:00.240
Not your so-called "family."

20:00.324 --> 20:03.702
The difference being that Kingpin
may not have the tools

20:03.785 --> 20:06.663
to be able to express that
in a positive way.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.873

a ton of traumatic events,

20:17.549 --> 20:19.259

Vincent and Alaqua, their dynamic

20:50.123 --> 20:55.587

21:02.052 --> 21:03.720
<i>But they're both so authentic</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:07.266
<i>and have put so much time and attention</i>

21:07.349 --> 21:11.687
<i>into their characters in the show</i>
<i>and their work.</i>

21:11.770 --> 21:14.731
<i>There's almost a playfulness</i>
<i>between the two of them</i>

<i>that I think is really helpful</i>
<i>when you look at Maya and Kingpin</i>

21:18.819 --> 21:20.737

come out on top after an interaction.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.743

Quiet, everybody. Hold the work.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.709

The big dialogue scenes
that I've done with Alaqua,

22:19.629 --> 22:24.718
<i>those will stick in my memory</i>
<i>because there's a superhero aspect to it,</i>

22:24.801 --> 22:28.388
<i>but mainly</i>
<i>it's about a father and a daughter.</i>

22:28.472 --> 22:30.974
To play both of those
things simultaneously,

22:31.058 --> 22:34.102
<i>I've definitely never done that before,</i>
<i>so it's quite unique.</i>

22:36.646 --> 22:39.775
Well, that's the extent of my talent.
That's it.

22:40.984 --> 22:45.280
We knew that we really wanted for him
to feel like Kingpin

22:45.364 --> 22:48.867
and for the overall look
to look very Kingpin.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.580
<i>And one thing that</i>
<i>was really important that we noticed</i>

22:53.663 --> 22:55.999
<i>was the collars of his shirts</i>

22:56.583 --> 22:59.336
are not your typical size collar
of a men's dress shirt.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.464
They're much wider, like, two inches.

23:02.547 --> 23:06.009
And so, we knew we wanted to do that
to really frame his face,

23:06.093 --> 23:08.553
<i>and make him look powerful.</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:11.139
<i>And just the suits...</i>
<i>The sharpness of the suits.</i>

23:11.223 --> 23:14.226
The most technical part of it
was just making sure

23:14.309 --> 23:18.105
that the suits looked like
he was kind of bursting out of them.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.400
<i>You put that muscle suit on</i>
<i>and then the clothes go on top of it.</i>

23:21.483 --> 23:24.694
<i>So, the actor literally has</i>
<i>a whole another layer on top of them.</i>

23:24.778 --> 23:27.447
And it was important
for Kingpin to have that.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.324
<i>It just makes everything bigger.</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:31.827
<i>Your arms bigger, your shoulders bigger.</i>

23:31.910 --> 23:35.831

of that imposing nature that Kingpin has.

<i>And there were all these beautiful murals</i>
<i>surrounding the rink.</i>

29:31.144 --> 29:33.146
Clockwork turn all the way around.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.400
So we can see...
This is the most important thing.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.693
Yeah, great.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.279
So, camera here.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.740
So when you turn...

29:43.823 --> 29:45.283
-Yeah.
-Full body.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.578
Gotcha. Sounds good.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.205
One more?

29:52.582 --> 29:54.042
SCIZAK: <i>In designing the fights,</i>

29:54.125 --> 29:57.462
we wanted to add in, you know,
a little bit of the jujitsu,

29:57.545 --> 29:59.172
<i>a little bit of the tae kwon do,</i>

29:59.255 --> 30:01.633
<i>a little bit</i>
<i>of the other martial art forms</i>

30:01.716 --> 30:05.178
<i>in her, like, brutal fighting style</i>

30:05.261 --> 30:07.347
<i>where she doesn't pull punches.</i>

30:08.348 --> 30:10.391
It's different. Yes, perfect.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.479
SCIZAK: <i>And when she does fight,</i>

30:14.562 --> 30:17.774
it's to basically make
as much mayhem as possible.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.359
(INAUDIBLE)

30:25.657 --> 30:27.283
(GRUNTING)

30:29.285 --> 30:30.286
(GROANS)

30:30.578 --> 30:32.413
PALMER: <i>It's mostly hand to hand combat.</i>

30:32.497 --> 30:34.666
There's cool gags with weapons
that Maya does.

30:34.749 --> 30:38.336
There's a whole fight in the skate rink
where Maya is basically forced to grab

30:38.419 --> 30:41.089
everything around her at the rink
and use them as a weapon.

30:41.172 --> 30:44.509
<i>And we even see Maya,</i>
<i>whether she knows it or not at the time,</i>

30:44.592 --> 30:46.678
<i>she's channeling</i>
<i>some of the specific moves</i>

30:46.761 --> 30:50.682
<i>and some of the specific strategies</i>
<i>that her ancestors channeled years ago.</i>

30:52.725 --> 30:55.019
SCIZAK: Can she hold the gun
closer to her body?

30:55.895 --> 30:57.021
MAN: Rolling.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.898
SCIZAK: Good.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.358
That looks amazing.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.985
I know it feels weird,

31:03.444 --> 31:04.988
but it looks good on camera.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.364
Can we try to do that?

31:07.782 --> 31:09.784
Catch in with this lineup for the gun.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.038
Yes, that looks amazing.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.540
Looks really, really good.

31:15.623 --> 31:19.127
With Alaqua, one leg is prosthetic.
So, it was a lot of fun

31:19.210 --> 31:21.546
to do a little trial and error with that.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.555
<i>She can do bigger blocks with it,</i>

31:30.638 --> 31:32.724
<i>where she doesn't have the pain</i>

31:32.807 --> 31:35.310
that somebody else might, you know, have.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.061
(BOTH GRUNTING)

31:44.027 --> 31:47.322
We had to have Daredevil here,
because Echo, Maya Lopez,

31:47.405 --> 31:49.407
<i>is a character from the</i> Daredevil <i>comics.</i>

31:49.490 --> 31:52.035
<i>How could we have an Echo show</i>
<i>without Daredevil?</i>

31:52.118 --> 31:53.786
Your first time working together.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.997
PALMER:<i> So, we thought about</i>
<i>the best way to do it,</i>

31:56.080 --> 31:59.083
and we figured, "Let's tell
our own version of the comics' story

31:59.167 --> 32:03.922
<i>"in which Maya and Daredevil meet</i>
<i>while Maya Lopez is on a mission</i>

32:04.005 --> 32:07.467
<i>"to prove herself to Kingpin,</i>
<i>to prove herself to the tracksuit mafia,</i>

32:07.550 --> 32:08.801
<i>"that she can roll with them."</i>

32:08.885 --> 32:11.220
<i>She can be just as badass</i>
<i>as any of those guys.</i>

32:11.304 --> 32:13.389
And she proves it by fighting Daredevil.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.940
The way that these characters operate is

32:22.023 --> 32:25.777
as they are in combat with someone,
they're learning about the other person,

32:25.860 --> 32:28.488
<i>they're learning about their training</i>
<i>and their capabilities.</i>

32:28.571 --> 32:30.615
What's interesting
about these two characters

32:30.698 --> 32:32.492
is that, as they're fighting,

32:32.575 --> 32:35.453
<i>they are discovering</i>
<i>that both of them have a disability.</i>

32:37.163 --> 32:39.499

32:43.211 --> 32:45.213
(BOTH GRUNTING)

32:47.173 --> 32:49.509
SCIZAK: <i>Daredevil's a little bit</i>
<i>caught off-guard</i>

32:49.592 --> 32:51.761
by her ability to get the upper hand here.

32:51.844 --> 32:55.515
You know, there's a gunshot
that goes off right next to his ear,

32:55.598 --> 32:59.435
which, for anybody, it would be something
that causes a little bit of stress,

32:59.519 --> 33:01.187
<i>but for him, it's even more.</i>

33:01.270 --> 33:05.233
<i>So, they basically try to use</i>
<i>their senses against each other.</i>

33:12.782 --> 33:15.326
(INAUDIBLE)

33:15.410 --> 33:16.619
(HEART BEATING)

33:18.538 --> 33:20.707
PALMER: <i>Sound design on this one</i>
<i>has been amazing.</i>

33:22.875 --> 33:27.463
We want to convey the deaf experience
to hearing audiences the best we can.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.466
We can never fully do that,
but there's moments in the show

33:30.550 --> 33:33.136
where we drop out the sound
or we'll drop out sound effects

33:33.219 --> 33:36.389
and keep score or sometimes,
frankly, we'll drop everything out.

33:40.643 --> 33:43.896
It's quite amazing
to see how it changes a scene,

33:43.980 --> 33:46.566
and you could watch a whole scene
with all the sound,

33:46.649 --> 33:48.026
<i>and it's really awesome.</i>

33:48.109 --> 33:51.446
<i>But when you take the sound out,</i>
<i>you feel like, "Oh, this is Maya's story.</i>

33:51.529 --> 33:52.613
<i>"I get it."</i>

33:52.697 --> 33:55.908
We're trying to help the audience
put themselves in Maya's shoes

33:55.992 --> 33:57.326
as much as possible.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.039
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

34:46.834 --> 34:50.588
TANTOO CARDINAL: <i>From my character's</i>
<i>perspective, it's a revelation for me</i>

34:51.380 --> 34:55.051
to see the powers,
that my own daughter had,

34:55.134 --> 34:57.929
<i>now in my granddaughter.</i>

34:58.012 --> 35:03.684
<i>And so, I created</i>
<i>this whole warrior's outfit for her.</i>

35:08.397 --> 35:12.860
It was very exciting when I saw Alaqua
for the first time.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.364
It was, "Yes, yes! Here she is.

35:16.447 --> 35:20.618
"We've been needing a superhero
for a long, long time,

35:21.494 --> 35:23.037
<i>"and there she is."</i>

35:25.873 --> 35:29.502
LILLAS: <i>We knew we really wanted to</i>
<i>incorporate a lot of the Choctaw symbols.</i>

35:29.585 --> 35:32.088
One of the big things is
their Choctaw diamonds

35:32.171 --> 35:34.465
that they wear on their
traditional dresses.

35:34.549 --> 35:38.553
<i>And we knew that we wanted</i>
<i>to put that in multiple places.</i>

35:38.636 --> 35:41.055
<i>So, that was a main focal point.</i>

35:54.485 --> 35:58.239
Generally, you put this strip on first,
and then you put that in the middle,

35:58.322 --> 35:59.824
and start working with it.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.742
Like, I might work all the way down.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.579
And then when I start over,
I come back down on this side.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.122
-MAN: Okay. Yeah.
-So...

36:06.706 --> 36:10.084
PESHAWN BREAD: <i>When people are</i>
<i>creating beadwork, it takes a lot of time.</i>

36:10.168 --> 36:13.504
When you do beadwork, you have to be
in a state of good intention,

36:13.588 --> 36:17.216
and you have to not put
any negative energy into that work.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.844
<i>Because that's something</i>
<i>that someone will wear.</i>

36:19.927 --> 36:23.055
<i>And that's medicine.</i>
<i>It's something that you carry with you.</i>

36:23.139 --> 36:25.975
<i>It's that energy you carry with you.</i>
<i>It's that prayer.</i>

36:27.602 --> 36:29.687
So, we had to work with their timeline,

36:29.770 --> 36:32.523
and give them enough time
to send us samples.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.859
See the samples, give our notes,

36:34.942 --> 36:38.154
send it back to them,
and then have them do the next round.

36:38.237 --> 36:41.616
<i>But we really worked closely</i>
<i>with the Choctaw to make sure</i>

36:41.699 --> 36:46.412
<i>that they were really proud</i>
<i>of her super suit costume.</i>

36:46.495 --> 36:48.289
The main thing was making sure

36:48.372 --> 36:51.042
that they approved, (CHUCKLES)
above anybody else, really.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.420

-WOMAN: This just blows me away.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.018
<i>was much, much more so than just clothing.</i>

37:09.101 --> 37:11.646
It looks fabulous,
but that story that it's telling

37:11.729 --> 37:14.774
<i>is stronger than any superhero power</i>

37:14.857 --> 37:16.984
<i>that we ever get to portray on the screen.</i>

37:23.032 --> 37:24.367
Set's in Oklahoma.

37:24.450 --> 37:28.537
The Choctaw Nation powwow
that we've put on is pretty amazing.

37:29.705 --> 37:33.000
People from all over are here tonight
to be a part of this powwow.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.836
It's one of the most special things
done in Marvel Studios.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.789
What we're gonna do is
we'll just be bringing 'em in.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.167
And then, when you guys tell us to cut,

38:15.251 --> 38:17.920
usually the ringleader goes like this,
they're all in.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.714
We'll stomp this out.

38:19.797 --> 38:22.800
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

38:30.891 --> 38:33.978
We started this process
of putting together this powwow,

38:34.061 --> 38:37.023
and trying to figure out the logistics
of what it would take

38:37.106 --> 38:39.567
to get everyone and everything here
that we needed

38:39.650 --> 38:41.777
to accurately represent the powwow.

38:41.861 --> 38:45.906
And ultimately, we just determined
that we should just throw a powwow.

38:57.918 --> 39:01.464
<i>We go out to the real performers,</i>
<i>the real dancers,</i>

39:01.547 --> 39:05.259
<i>the real singers, the real drummers,</i>
<i>the real vendors.</i>

39:05.343 --> 39:08.512
In every respect,
reaching out to that community,

39:08.596 --> 39:11.724
and just asking them
if they would come to Georgia,

39:11.807 --> 39:16.479
and be a part
of the first powwow in the MCU.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.231
SHIKOBA: (ON MIC) Look at this
beautiful powwow tonight,

39:40.044 --> 39:42.296
KING: <i>You can't fake this with actors.</i>

39:42.380 --> 39:46.008
The regalia that everybody wears
is very specific to their tribe.

39:46.592 --> 39:50.012
<i>So, it's not something you can just dress</i>
<i>from a costume house.</i>

39:50.096 --> 39:53.099
We had so many people come
and bring their family's regalia

39:53.182 --> 39:55.976
that's been passed down to them
through generations.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.604
<i>One of the dancers was telling me</i>

39:58.687 --> 40:01.982
<i>that she had yellow regalia,</i>
<i>which isn't typical for her tribe,</i>

40:02.066 --> 40:05.820
<i>but she had a dream about regalia,</i>
<i>and she was telling me that in her tribe,</i>

40:05.903 --> 40:09.073
<i>if you have a dream about a new regalia,</i>
<i>you have to go make that regalia.</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:11.492
<i>And that's really cool</i>
<i>to hear those stories.</i>

40:11.575 --> 40:13.160
So, I'm a jingle dress dancer.

40:13.244 --> 40:16.747
I've been dancing jingle
for a long time now.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.541
<i>The Anishinaabe people,</i>

40:18.624 --> 40:23.087
<i>they share this dress with other tribes,</i>
<i>and they use it as a healing dress.</i>

So, it's really important to, you know,

<i>have prayers while dancing,</i>
<i>and bring that healing to everything.</i>

40:28.717 --> 40:31.095
<i>So that's really what it is.</i>
<i>That's why I dance.</i>

40:31.178 --> 40:34.557
Right there, what you're listening to
is the medicine of our people.

40:34.640 --> 40:39.353
The beauty of this dance right here is
healing our hearts, our mind, our spirits.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.899
Let's give a round of applause
for our jingle dress dancers

40:43.983 --> 40:45.651
and their sidestep song.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.404
(SHIKOBA VOCABLES)

40:49.280 --> 40:51.657
It feels like a real powwow
and it does help us.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.327
It helps us as actors
to, like, accept this reality

40:55.411 --> 40:56.829
<i>and help do our job better.</i>

40:57.455 --> 41:01.000
The second night, once everything got
this lived-in quality,

41:01.083 --> 41:03.043
<i>I remember I started to relax.</i>

41:03.127 --> 41:06.213
<i>I was like, "Yeah, I'm at a powwow.</i>
<i>I'm gonna go hang out.</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:09.008
<i>"I'm gonna hang out with friends.</i>
<i>Go to the concession stand."</i>

41:09.091 --> 41:11.469
But then, "No, I'm on a film set.
I can't relax.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.180
"We got to get the shots and stuff."
It was weird.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.390
It was this constant push and pull
of like,

41:16.474 --> 41:18.767
"I'm gonna relax. No, I can't."

41:18.851 --> 41:21.604
You know, (CHUCKLES) and it was...

41:21.687 --> 41:24.940
I guess that's a testament
to how well our art department team did,

41:25.024 --> 41:29.195
<i>and our AD team did in terms of</i>
<i>bringing in the dancers and all that.</i>

41:33.115 --> 41:35.826
After being in the heat for three nights,

41:35.910 --> 41:40.623
(CHUCKLES) and shooting back to back,
and being tired,

41:40.706 --> 41:45.669
it felt really good to have
everyone come together at the end,

<i>and to fully have that experience.</i>

43:15.759 --> 43:20.598
So, for us to do a round dance at the end,
it was a really beautiful moment.

43:21.307 --> 43:24.810
It was a beautiful moment to see people
that have been tense behind camera,

43:24.893 --> 43:26.979
<i>or people that have been running around,</i>

43:27.062 --> 43:31.025
<i>just rejoice</i>
<i>and finally understand the beauty</i>

43:31.108 --> 43:32.526
<i>of what we just did.</i>

43:32.610 --> 43:35.070
<i>And to see the sun coming up,</i>
<i>and to take that in,</i>

43:35.154 --> 43:37.156
<i>and to take in the fresh moment,</i>

43:38.532 --> 43:39.867
<i>it felt really powerful.</i>

43:40.242 --> 43:41.910
WOMAN: <i>Thank you for the lives, Lord,</i>

43:42.578 --> 43:45.247
that are represented,
the tribes that are represented,

43:45.331 --> 43:47.249
the nations that are represented.

43:47.791 --> 43:51.211
<i>I just pray that you will just continue</i>
<i>to work within us.</i>

43:51.962 --> 43:55.549
<i>For we are all here for a purpose.</i>
<i>And that's your purpose.</i>

43:56.634 --> 43:59.053
I just give you all the glory,
honor and praise, Lord.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.474
PALMER: <i>She's not exactly a hero</i>
<i>by the end of this show.</i>

44:03.557 --> 44:05.684
I think she has chosen her family,

44:05.768 --> 44:08.270
and chosen selflessness over selfishness.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.606
But that doesn't exactly
make her a hero yet.

44:11.273 --> 44:12.941
(GASPING)

44:14.443 --> 44:15.569
What did you just do?

44:16.528 --> 44:18.739
What did you do? Huh?

44:20.616 --> 44:22.284
(YELLS) What did you do?

44:22.368 --> 44:25.621
D'ONOFRIO: <i>I love it that Fisk</i>
<i>comes into the series,</i>

44:25.704 --> 44:30.668
and you get to see that relationship
that's iconic when it comes to the comic.

44:32.795 --> 44:36.048
<i>But there is so much more</i>
<i>to Echo than that.</i>

44:36.131 --> 44:38.509
<i>It's Maya's origin story to become Echo,</i>

44:38.592 --> 44:42.513
<i>and it's got this flavor</i>
<i>that's very spiritual and very cool.</i>

44:43.806 --> 44:45.516
CARDINAL: <i>I was raised by my grandmother.</i>

44:45.599 --> 44:47.601
I was raised in the bush,

44:47.685 --> 44:51.689
and the people that have been my heroes
are people from the land.

44:51.772 --> 44:54.358
<i>And that's where my essence breathes from.</i>

44:54.900 --> 45:00.322
I couldn't be involved
unless my world can be brought forward.

45:02.408 --> 45:05.285
And this is my world.

45:07.579 --> 45:10.541
FREELAND: <i>One of the things that</i>
<i>initially attracted me to the project</i>

45:10.624 --> 45:14.086
<i>was this idea of balance</i>
<i>is something that is very specific</i>

45:14.169 --> 45:15.754
<i>to Native American communities.</i>

45:15.838 --> 45:17.172
It's like, "Oh, this is cool."

45:17.256 --> 45:19.675
"It isn't about a character
swinging between extremes.

45:19.758 --> 45:22.469
<i>"It's about a character</i>
<i>on an extreme finding balance."</i>

45:22.553 --> 45:25.723
HENRY: I don't want you to become me.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.934
CHASKE: <i>I'm very proud and very grateful</i>
<i>to be a part of Maya's story.</i>

45:29.017 --> 45:30.978
And Alaqua is amazing as Maya Lopez,

45:31.061 --> 45:33.397
<i>and the supporting cast</i>
<i>around her were her team.</i>

45:36.024 --> 45:38.736
GRAHAM GREENE: <i>When I started out</i>
<i>in the business 42 years ago,</i>

45:38.819 --> 45:41.238
there wasn't that many opportunities left.

45:41.321 --> 45:44.074
<i>There's a lot of really talented kids</i>
<i>out there</i>

45:44.158 --> 45:46.660
<i>that should be part of this,</i>
<i>if they wanted to be.</i>

45:46.744 --> 45:48.620
<i>And lo and behold, there's Alaqua.</i>

45:48.704 --> 45:51.665
I'm so proud of her.
She's just a wonderful girl.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.626
(ALAQUA SIGNING)

46:22.237 --> 46:26.033
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a wrap on <i>Echo.</i>

46:26.116 --> 46:27.701
-Way to go, everybody.
-(APPLAUSE)

46:33.332 --> 46:35.876
(APPLAUSE)

46:37.628 --> 46:38.754
Thank you, everybody.
