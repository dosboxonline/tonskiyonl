WEBVTT

00:08.633 --> 00:12.303
Here we are. It's go time.
Day one. Day one of 90.

00:12.303 --> 00:16.182
Monday, June the 13th, 2022.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.892
London, U.K.

00:17.892 --> 00:22.480
<i>Time doesn't exist in the TVA
and it doesn't exist in Loki's world.</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:24.024
<i>And here we are.</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:26.067
Although, it exists in my head.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.195
<i>I woke up this morning full of excitement
and full of gratitude, actually.</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:33.533
<i>I just felt so lucky that I get to do this
and I'm still doing it, and...</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:35.952
Yeah, I'm just, I'm excited to be back.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.373
Back in the game, back in the TVA,
back with this amazing team.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.061
<i>We were all excited
to explore and unleash</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:02.479
<i>the Multiverse in Season 1...</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:04.022
Something terrible is happening.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.733
When you're dealing with time travel,
with the Multiverse,

01:06.733 --> 01:09.319
the plot can get very heavy.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.613
And the only way any of that works

01:11.613 --> 01:14.032
<i>is usually to make it
as simple as possible</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.784
<i>and to lean into your characters.</i>

01:15.784 --> 01:17.827
Mobius, it's me.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.746
I don't know you.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.832
<i>On the outset,
we have to have all those conversations</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:25.919
<i>about where this is gonna fit
into the MCU,</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:28.797
where this will fit
within all the other stories,

01:28.797 --> 01:31.800
and how it will impact
all the other characters.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.470
<i>But as much as we could,
after we had those conversations,</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:38.515
<i>we tried to step back
and just look at this as,</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.725
<i>"Okay, now let's tell our story."</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:43.228
You were a villain and now you're not.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.438
I thought we were good guys.
Now I'm not so sure.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.942
At the very least, you've made us
ask some appropriate questions.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.486
Our approach was
really, really doubling down

01:51.486 --> 01:53.446
on who Loki cares about,
who we care about.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.657
<i>And then even trying
to personalize the stakes of,</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.659
<i>"What is a timeline?
What is on a timeline?</i>

01:57.659 --> 01:59.035
<i>"What does that mean
to people?"</i>

01:59.035 --> 02:03.706
Our job just really became helping steer
these characters into the vulnerability

02:03.706 --> 02:06.042
<i>that brought their humanity
to the surface.</i>

02:06.042 --> 02:10.130
I know it's hard to turn your back
on everything you have believed in.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.884
But the TVA has to change
and it has to change now.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.178
It's almost like a snow globe.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.681
You know,
the TVA was a kind of snow globe

02:19.681 --> 02:21.391
and the glass has been cracked

02:21.391 --> 02:23.935
and the whole thing has been shaken up,

02:23.935 --> 02:27.397
<i>and so, the TVA
is in a process quite similar</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:29.732
<i>to the process Loki went through
in Season 1,</i>

02:29.732 --> 02:35.405
<i>which is a process of soul searching
and institutional analysis.</i>

02:35.405 --> 02:40.076
That's who built this place!
That's who stole your lives!

02:40.076 --> 02:42.370
I think one of the things
we talked about is,

02:42.370 --> 02:45.248
he always struggled with family
in the MCU,

02:45.248 --> 02:48.793
<i>but he's found a new family in the TVA.</i>

02:48.793 --> 02:51.838
Let me ask you, the Time Door
somehow sent you into the past

02:51.838 --> 02:54.132
- and that's what started all this?
- Well, it was...

02:56.301 --> 02:57.677
Which way are we going?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.095
The chemistry between the actors

02:59.095 --> 03:01.848
is something we wanted to continue
to explore in Season 2.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.308
<i>They just really
got along, right,</i>

03:03.308 --> 03:06.186
<i>they kind of clicked from the moment
that they were on set together</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:07.562
<i>and had so much fun.</i>

03:07.562 --> 03:09.397
<i>And we wanted to take that further.</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:11.858
- We did it!
- We did it!

03:11.858 --> 03:12.984
We won!

03:12.984 --> 03:15.278
It's a really special group of people.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.823
<i>Series 1 was full of challenges,
you know.</i>

03:18.823 --> 03:23.620
There was a global pandemic and I think
that actually brought us together.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.872
<i>And I think it shows onscreen.</i>

03:26.748 --> 03:29.125
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Very nice, very nice, very nice.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.627
<i>It was great coming back.</i>

03:30.627 --> 03:33.588
It had been a long time
since we'd seen each other.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.884
<i>It's tricky thinking about, like,
who B-15 is in Season 1</i>

03:37.884 --> 03:39.886
<i>and who she evolves into
in Season 2.</i>

03:39.886 --> 03:43.139
I had to rewatch Season 1.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.934
<i>And you go, "I remember what happened
but who was she again?</i>

03:45.934 --> 03:48.561
<i>"And how does she sound?
How does she move?"</i>

03:48.561 --> 03:52.315
And then, you put on the costume
and you go, "Yeah, I remember this."

03:54.651 --> 03:57.820
Hey, O.B., this is Casey.
I thought he could help.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.824
There's a lot of performers that
I didn't get to play with in Season 1.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.410
<i>And this season, I got to...</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.580
play with everybody else,
and I mean everybody.

04:07.580 --> 04:12.001
<i>And there is a chemistry there
that is amazing.</i>

04:12.001 --> 04:15.880
<i>And I think by introducing
a bunch of new characters,</i>

04:15.880 --> 04:20.051
you got to see more
of the world of the TVA.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.678
You're Ouroboros?

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
- Yes.
- You wrote the TVA Handbook.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.308
- You've read it?
- Read it? I practically memorized it.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.686
- Would you sign it for me?
- Happy to.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.984
<i>It's really exciting
because I've been a fan</i>

04:35.984 --> 04:38.569
<i>of the Marvel Universe
for a long, long time.</i>

04:38.569 --> 04:40.780
Oh, hey, welcome to R&A.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.451
And I always fantasized
about joining the MCU family.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.120
<i>But I didn't think
it would ever come true</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:50.039
<i>because it wasn't until recently
that I got back into acting.</i>

04:50.039 --> 04:54.127
<i>And one day, my agent told me that,</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.838
<i>"Kevin Feige is going
to give you a call."</i>

04:56.838 --> 05:00.508
And he told me between a certain time,
between 5:00 and 7:00.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.010
And I was so nervous.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.721
At the same time,
I was also very, very excited.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.057
And I remember,
I was in a meeting at that time,

05:08.474 --> 05:10.977
and I told the person
I was having a meeting with,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.187
and I said, "I'm so sorry,

05:13.187 --> 05:15.690
"but at 4:50,
I'm gonna have to leave."

05:15.690 --> 05:17.900
And I didn't tell them why.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.194
So I set my alarm clock at 4:50.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.572
And when it rang, I got out of there,

05:22.572 --> 05:26.159
expecting this important call
from Mr. Kevin Feige.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.788
<i>And I was just driving home,
and all of a sudden, my phone rang.</i>

05:30.788 --> 05:33.499
<i>And I picked it up,
and on the other end,</i>

05:33.499 --> 05:34.834
<i>you know, I heard this voice,</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.462
"Hello. Hi. I'm Kevin Feige.
Hello, Ke."

05:37.837 --> 05:39.672
And he was telling me

05:39.672 --> 05:43.051
about how much he enjoyed
<i>Everything Everywhere All At Once.</i>

05:43.843 --> 05:46.220
<i>And I was driving, and...</i>

05:47.472 --> 05:51.893
<i>he was just praising my performance
and praising the movie.</i>

05:52.477 --> 05:55.355
And I started getting teary-eyed.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.526
And I was driving and I couldn't see.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.613
And I had to pull off
to the side of the road.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.325
And... And we're talking and then,

06:08.076 --> 06:11.579
then he said, you know,
"Would you like to join the MCU family?"

06:11.579 --> 06:13.706
I was... I was ecstatic.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.416
I was so happy.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.169
And to get that call from him
meant the world to me.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.546
It's great being part of a team.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.049
<i>And sure enough,
couple of months later,</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:24.884
<i>I was on a flight to London.</i>

06:28.054 --> 06:30.598
There you go.
That's everything you need to know.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.105
<i>O.B. was a character
who was a really fun introduction</i>

06:37.105 --> 06:39.982
<i>to the Repairs and Advancements world,</i>

06:39.982 --> 06:45.071
<i>and another interesting kind of leaf
to kind of uncover at the TVA.</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:48.574
Everything you need to know about this,
I wrote about it in here.

06:49.742 --> 06:54.080
<i>Similarly, we wanted to tell
more stories with our Minutemen.</i>

06:54.080 --> 06:56.999
So we will meet General Dox
who is played by Kate Dickie,

06:56.999 --> 07:02.088
<i>or Hunter X-5, who also becomes
Brad Wolfe, by Rafael Casal.</i>

07:03.047 --> 07:06.217
Oh, good. Welcome back.
Why don't you take off this Time Collar

07:06.217 --> 07:08.094
and treat me like somebody
who outranks you?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.178
Oh, I don't work here.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.265
Oh, I'm glad that you know that.
You should stop talking now.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.309
<i>X-5 Brad Wolfe
is an antagonist for Season 2.</i>

07:15.309 --> 07:19.147
It's a weird phrase on a show
that's about an antagonist.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.774
You know, we're all in a show

07:21.774 --> 07:26.154
that is about exposing the duality
and humanity of the antagonist.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.656
<i>And so, in a lot of ways,
the way we talked about</i>

07:28.656 --> 07:30.491
<i>X-5 and Brad Wolfe</i>

07:30.491 --> 07:33.411
was as Loki's sort of
mirror for Season 2

07:33.411 --> 07:35.580
<i>of another person who feels wronged</i>

07:35.580 --> 07:38.040
<i>and is trying to find the justice
of themselves,</i>

07:38.040 --> 07:41.461
<i>and is also trying to figure out
what the goodness in them means.</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:45.548
You could do with a little perspective
on yourself, so let me help you here.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.719
It's you. You're the problem.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.681
Every single time we've come across
one of you, it's you.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.393
<i>A lot of my job
was get under Loki's skin.</i>

07:57.393 --> 08:00.521
<i>And so, I think Tom and I
got to have so much fun with that.</i>

08:04.025 --> 08:07.320
<i>And what's great is that
the character X-5 of Brad Wolfe</i>

08:07.320 --> 08:09.489
<i>has worked at the TVA so long</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:12.366
<i>that he's read his file so many times.</i>

08:12.366 --> 08:13.826
He knows him so well.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.079
Earlier, I said some
really hurtful things,

08:17.079 --> 08:21.000
even brought up your mom.
I'm very, very sorry about that.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.753
What does this one do?

08:25.046 --> 08:27.798
<i>Tom is the person
who's setting the tone for everything.</i>

08:27.798 --> 08:29.467
<i>And he and I would talk a lot</i>

08:29.467 --> 08:32.803
about setting the floor
and setting the ceiling for the show.

08:32.803 --> 08:36.224
<i>And what you do is you look at Tom to know
how big to go and how small to go.</i>

08:36.224 --> 08:38.935
- And now we know what the numbers are.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.311
Yeah.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.022
<i>And he's a veteran
in this world, he knows,</i>

08:43.022 --> 08:45.066
<i>you know, what a scene needs.</i>

08:45.066 --> 08:46.943
<i>So it's amazing to sort of watch him</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:50.029
set those markers in a scene,
like, "All right, let's...

08:50.029 --> 08:52.657
"Let's play this one this way
or play this one really big."

08:52.657 --> 08:55.243
You wanna be, ideally, chasing the bike
and I'm chasing...

08:55.243 --> 08:56.994
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.832
<i>A lot of us haven't ever acted
in something this big before.</i>

09:01.832 --> 09:04.835
<i>We go, "All right, yeah, this is a world
where people teleport</i>

09:04.835 --> 09:08.589
<i>"and blow out walls, and like,
fly through space and time."</i>

09:08.589 --> 09:11.842
I need a little help adjusting,
you know, you gotta help me get there.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.513
<i>Tom is way beyond
just the lead performer.</i>

09:15.513 --> 09:19.600
He is in the writers room,
he is in the visual effects meetings,

09:19.600 --> 09:21.185
he is right there with us.

09:21.185 --> 09:25.022
<i>He is very much the author
of all things</i> Loki.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.901
A group of people
who have a collective aura,

09:28.901 --> 09:31.279
unique to that moment in time.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.405
Does that make sense?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.657
Sort of like you're drawing the...

09:34.657 --> 09:35.992
<i>Tom is fabulous.</i>

09:35.992 --> 09:40.037
He will always want
to give that extra take.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.957
The extra... The extra 20 percent.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.876
<i>And he comes in wanting to give,
wanting to perform.</i>

09:45.876 --> 09:48.379
<i>There's something
that he's working towards.</i>

09:48.379 --> 09:53.843
And my job as an editor
is to listen to his performance.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.470
<i>For Tom, there are shades to it.</i>

09:56.470 --> 09:58.598
<i>He may adjust his pace,</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:01.267
<i>he may adjust his intensity.</i>

10:01.267 --> 10:03.811
But by and large,
he's very, very focused.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.896
It's not about where or when.

10:05.896 --> 10:09.317
It's about who. Who I care about.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.361
I can rewrite the story.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.074
- And, scene.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.201
<i>What's really interesting,</i>

10:19.201 --> 10:22.413
<i>every morning,
the way we began the day,</i>

10:22.413 --> 10:25.124
<i>Tom would walk onto the stage,</i>

10:25.124 --> 10:28.252
<i>but before you see him,
you would hear him,</i>

10:28.252 --> 10:29.920
because he always comes to set

10:29.920 --> 10:32.923
with a little, you know,
portable speaker.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.760
And you would hear him enter the stage,

10:35.760 --> 10:37.595
make his way to the set,

10:37.595 --> 10:40.848
and when he arrives,
it just wakes everybody up

10:40.848 --> 10:42.933
<i>and lifts everybody's spirit up.</i>

10:42.933 --> 10:45.102
<i>And that's how
we start the day every day.</i>

10:45.102 --> 10:47.396
<i>It's amazing
just having him there,</i>

10:47.396 --> 10:49.315
leading the way as Loki,

10:49.315 --> 10:52.943
and then, everybody else just having,
like, a fun ensemble.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.988
And it's a great ensemble that will save,

10:55.988 --> 10:58.115
you know, humanity.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.534
I mean, honestly,
that's what we do here at the TVA.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.745
We should be dealing
with the bigger problem here.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.539
- He Who Remains.
- I understand and we'll get to that.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.667
In order to do that,
I need a Loki Who Remains.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.835
We need to address you disappearing.

11:12.713 --> 11:16.133
<i>We knew we wanted
to embrace the idea</i>

11:16.133 --> 11:19.387
<i>of time looping
throughout this season.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:23.557
<i>We talked a lot about</i> Slaughterhouse-Five,
<i>the Kurt Vonnegut novel,</i>

11:23.557 --> 11:27.103
<i>where there's somebody who's slipping
through time, uncontrollably,</i>

11:27.103 --> 11:30.690
trying to figure out how to make sense
of their life and the narrative

11:30.690 --> 11:32.983
because they're
experiencing it all out of order.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.153
<i>And there was something in that
that was really compelling with Loki.</i>

11:36.153 --> 11:40.616
<i>He desperately is trying
to get back to our TVA</i>

11:40.616 --> 11:43.160
<i>and let them know
something terrible is coming.</i>

11:43.160 --> 11:46.580
<i>And yet, Loki can't even just stay
in a single place.</i>

11:47.581 --> 11:51.877
Something had happened
to the nature of time.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.172
<i>Once He Who Remains
is killed by Sylvie,</i>

11:55.172 --> 11:57.591
<i>the timelines start to branch.</i>

11:57.591 --> 12:01.554
<i>And essentially,
Loki's anchor in the dimension of time</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:03.013
becomes unstable.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.307
It's real, Mobius.
I'll be in the past TVA

12:05.307 --> 12:08.561
and suddenly I'll feel it all grow thin
and I'll be torn apart,

12:08.561 --> 12:11.397
pulled through time,
ripped from there to here.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.482
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.110
But I don't know how long I have
until it happens again.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.655
<i>His physical presence
doesn't have a secure grip</i>

12:19.655 --> 12:22.032
on temporal reality.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.785
You know, even right now, I think,

12:24.785 --> 12:27.288
I am here now.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.708
I'm here in space, but I'm here now.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.084
And Loki's having a problem,

12:32.084 --> 12:35.504
<i>which is that he's rooted in space
but he's not rooted in time.</i>

12:35.504 --> 12:38.841
<i>And so, he's essentially glitching...</i>

12:38.841 --> 12:39.925
Damn it!

12:39.925 --> 12:43.679
...between the past, present
and the future.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.349
He's in one place, and then,
suddenly he's in the same place

12:47.349 --> 12:48.601
but at a different time.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.770
<i>It's incredibly destabilizing for him</i>

12:50.770 --> 12:53.230
<i>and for everybody
who's in his presence</i>

12:53.355 --> 12:55.649
<i>because it looks like
he keeps disappearing.</i>

12:57.443 --> 12:58.944
- You just disappeared.
- I know.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.363
And I can't keep looking at it
'cause it's horrible.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.407
What? I thought you said
it didn't look that bad.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.492
I was lying.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.580
<i>It's sort of evolved
as we've been discussing this</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:13.000
<i>on a script level and also
a character level and a visual level.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:16.128
And realizing that one of the things
that could be very interesting

13:16.128 --> 13:19.048
is making it a very painful experience.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.509
<i>And Tom has really embraced this.</i>

13:21.509 --> 13:24.053
So it's kind of
a windmill and down.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.556
<i>And he has given us
these incredible performances</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:31.977
<i>that we in visual effects will be
joining up these various elements of him</i>

13:31.977 --> 13:35.606
<i>as he goes through and flickers
through these different time periods.</i>

13:36.232 --> 13:40.653
<i>Loki's body is being
molecularly ripped apart.</i>

13:40.778 --> 13:44.532
Ripped... Every...
Every atom, every cell in his body

13:44.532 --> 13:48.619
is being ripped
and pulled apart, disassembled,

13:48.619 --> 13:50.496
and then reassembled very quickly

13:50.496 --> 13:53.082
and kind of re-ripping in another time.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
<i>There's a line
about looking like</i>

13:54.875 --> 13:57.711
<i>he's being born and dying
all at the same time.</i>

13:57.711 --> 14:00.214
<i>And that idea of
how do you visualize that,</i>

14:00.214 --> 14:01.966
<i>how do you actually make it feel</i>

14:01.966 --> 14:04.009
gruesome and almost like a horror movie.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.179
<i>But not in a bloody guts and gore way,</i>

14:07.179 --> 14:09.932
<i>but something that's a little bit more
stylish and elegant.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:14.103
This is where I'm embarrassed
to say that in my

14:14.103 --> 14:17.815
limited carpet bag of physical abilities,

14:17.815 --> 14:20.067
I can't, in fact, time slip.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.278
So we've had to find a way.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.822
Obviously, I knew at some point,
I was going to be

14:24.822 --> 14:28.284
<i>brilliantly assisted
by our visual effects department.</i>

14:28.284 --> 14:30.995
<i>And I wanted to give them
enough to work with,</i>

14:30.995 --> 14:35.040
<i>so we tried to film different variations</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:40.212
<i>of being spun into or spun out of,</i>

14:40.212 --> 14:42.965
<i>or ripped away from,</i>

14:42.965 --> 14:45.259
<i>or pulled into, reality.</i>

14:45.259 --> 14:49.054
And then can you do one
where you're lunging right at the camera?

14:49.054 --> 14:50.890
So you come back at camera,

14:50.890 --> 14:53.517
twist around and come
right back at the camera.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.729
<i>He's giving us all these things
and he's throwing himself</i>

14:56.729 --> 14:59.565
into the, sort of, performances
absolutely brilliantly.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.650
You couldn't have asked
for a better performer

15:01.650 --> 15:03.569
<i>and a better partner
in this sort of endeavor.</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:06.280
Maybe I'll do one this way too?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.115
And then spin around, yeah.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.702
In the edit, we basically brought
all those elements together.

15:11.702 --> 15:16.916
We picked out, you know, the...
The craziest swinging of arms,

15:16.916 --> 15:20.044
<i>and we created an effect
in the edit for that.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:23.339
<i>And then with that,
we played with sounds.</i>

15:23.339 --> 15:27.885
We had stretching sounds
and bone crunching sounds

15:27.885 --> 15:30.846
and all kinds of things
that would really enhance

15:30.846 --> 15:32.890
<i>the visuals for the time slip.</i>

15:33.724 --> 15:35.559
And then,
we're taking those performances

15:35.559 --> 15:38.437
<i>and then creating this sort of meld
between them all</i>

15:38.437 --> 15:41.565
<i>and then stretching
between each performance.</i>

15:41.565 --> 15:44.360
<i>And in 3D, on the computer,</i>

15:44.360 --> 15:47.196
<i>we're simulating,
we're joining up these performances</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:50.699
<i>and we're using simulation software
and modeling software</i>

15:50.699 --> 15:53.327
<i>to stretch one performance to another</i>

15:53.327 --> 15:56.121
<i>and make it feel like
he's being ripped through time,</i>

15:56.121 --> 15:58.958
<i>and being born and dying
all at the same time.</i>

16:00.459 --> 16:02.586
I take my hat off already

16:02.586 --> 16:04.922
to the visual effects team
for helping me out.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.508
<i>But it has been a really physical thing.</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:09.677
<i>More physical than I thought
it was going to be.</i>

16:09.677 --> 16:11.679
London School of Contemporary Dance.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.182
It allowed us to play a fun game

16:15.182 --> 16:18.227
<i>of letting Loki slip
through various moments</i>

16:18.227 --> 16:21.689
<i>across all these branches
of the Sacred Timeline.</i>

16:22.272 --> 16:25.484
<i>But he's always being pulled
to people that he knows,</i>

16:25.484 --> 16:27.778
<i>or places that he's been before.</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:31.949
<i>And then we start to realize
that maybe in some way,</i>

16:31.949 --> 16:35.452
Loki is the glue that's holding
all of these things together.

16:35.452 --> 16:39.456
Every one of your friends
has a temporal aura, right?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.041
Right.

16:41.041 --> 16:45.587
Well, that means a group of people

16:45.587 --> 16:51.301
would have a collective aura
unique to that moment in time.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.931
<i>With each person in the TVA,</i>

16:55.931 --> 16:59.101
<i>we wanted to go further
into who they are,</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:00.894
what's driving them
to do everything.

17:00.894 --> 17:04.148
And they're all existing
in this sea change moment.

17:04.773 --> 17:08.902
Tell the TVA to stop pruning,
effective immediately.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.616
<i>Everybody at the TVA,
they lived one path,</i>

17:14.616 --> 17:18.704
<i>and now they're suddenly told that, like,
that path was foisted upon them,</i>

17:18.704 --> 17:21.582
that they had other lives,
that they are all Variants.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.543
I'm not a hunter,
you're not an analyst.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.295
None of this is real.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.423
You know, it's really hard
to keep an eye on the whole story.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.717
Because there's just,
there's time slipping,

17:31.717 --> 17:33.844
there's past Loki, present Loki,

17:33.844 --> 17:36.513
past B-15, present B-15,

17:36.513 --> 17:39.391
B-15 Variant on the timeline,

17:39.391 --> 17:42.144
and you know, there was,
even just the other day, we were like,

17:42.144 --> 17:45.147
"Oh, this is the first time
we've seen Loki time-slip."

17:45.147 --> 17:47.357
And I was like,
"No, we've seen it before."

17:47.357 --> 17:48.734
And they're like, "No actually,

17:48.734 --> 17:51.111
"we just shot out of sequence,
you haven't seen it.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.989
"And that wasn't you,
that was B-15 of the timeline,

17:53.989 --> 17:56.200
"that wasn't B-15 in the TVA."

17:56.200 --> 17:57.743
I was like, "Ahh!"

17:57.743 --> 18:01.371
<i>There were many conversations had
about how is everybody gonna respond,</i>

18:01.371 --> 18:04.625
<i>knowing that they had lives
on the timeline.</i>

18:04.625 --> 18:07.127
<i>B-15, she had a different experience</i>

18:07.127 --> 18:10.756
<i>because she was shown by Sylvie
what her life was on the timeline.</i>

18:14.551 --> 18:16.011
I looked happy.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.726
What now?

18:22.726 --> 18:23.894
<i>So when she comes in,</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:26.855
<i>she has kind of
a resolute feeling about that.</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:28.357
<i>And she wants to get back to that,</i>

18:28.357 --> 18:31.819
<i>but she also has to kind of fight
for that to exist for other people.</i>

18:32.361 --> 18:35.114
People have lives on the timeline, Mobius.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.659
They have to have the chance
to live those lives.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.579
The beauty of the writing
is that everyone has a journey.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.665
And, like, for me personally,

18:44.665 --> 18:48.127
I start off in my full armor

18:48.127 --> 18:50.671
<i>and Time Stick and bringing down gods.</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:59.763
<i>I end with a crooked tie and no armor.</i>

18:59.763 --> 19:02.432
She becomes softer and softer

19:02.432 --> 19:06.854
<i>and she's moving towards
who she once was on the timeline</i>

19:06.854 --> 19:09.106
rather than what the TVA made her.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.899
No turning back now.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.068
Who said anything about turning back?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.243
<i>The scene today is,</i>

19:21.243 --> 19:26.081
<i>Loki is returning to the timeline
to find Mobius,</i>

19:26.081 --> 19:30.502
<i>who is living his original life
where he is working...</i>

19:30.502 --> 19:34.298
Actually, right here, yeah.
It's called "Piranha."

19:34.298 --> 19:36.633
Piranha Powersports.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.679
<i>And they offer, you know,
things like this.</i>

19:40.679 --> 19:45.309
Well, they say the personal watercraft
is kind of the thinking man's dirt bike.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.895
Come on,
you ready for your Poseidon moment?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.605
Jump up on this bad boy.

19:50.731 --> 19:54.067
<i>How do I create a persona between Don</i>

19:54.067 --> 19:57.946
<i>that's different from Mobius?
Well, Don is a salesman.</i>

19:57.946 --> 20:02.034
<i>And so, it kind of has a bit of that
personality in trying to make a sale.</i>

20:02.034 --> 20:04.119
Hey, you know the Hawaiian word <i>"mana"?</i>

20:04.119 --> 20:08.582
It means "spiritual life force
that permeates the whole universe."

20:08.582 --> 20:12.377
You ready to jump up on this bad boy
and start sucking up the <i>mana?</i>

20:12.377 --> 20:17.132
<i>And Mobius is a little bit more
of a cynical detective type.</i>

20:17.132 --> 20:20.260
You gotta be careful when you've been
doing this as long as I have

20:20.260 --> 20:23.597
because you can start to phone it in
if you're not careful.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.351
Because it all gets
a little bit predictable, stale.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.437
But you are breathing new life
into this song.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.273
<i>The situation is funny,
the world is funny.</i>

20:33.273 --> 20:36.151
<i>The characters have...
have character to them.</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:38.695
<i>Like, Mobius can be eccentric</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:40.989
<i>because Loki is eccentric, he just is.</i>

20:41.323 --> 20:43.575
<i>But, like, they don't
see themselves that way.</i>

20:43.575 --> 20:45.827
They're the straight man
in this absurd world.

20:45.827 --> 20:50.207
Wind in the hair,
little mist slapping you in the face.

20:50.207 --> 20:53.585
And nothing but open water
in front of you.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.963
Man, I feel
like I'm shredding glass today.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.391
On the timeline,
O.B. is a sci-fi writer.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.393
<i>His name is A.D. Doug.</i>

21:09.393 --> 21:11.728
<i>PhD, extremely smart guy.</i>

21:11.728 --> 21:13.855
<i>But he's a passionate writer.</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:18.485
And he writes these amazing
science-fiction novels

21:18.485 --> 21:21.446
that nobody wants to read.

21:21.446 --> 21:25.075
Hey, look! You're lucky.
You should really give this a try.

21:25.075 --> 21:29.288
And right now,
we are in his garage, his workshop.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.417
And it is one of the coolest sets
I've ever seen.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.670
<i>What's so surprising on this series</i>

21:36.670 --> 21:39.881
<i>is that a lot of the sets are practical.</i>

21:39.881 --> 21:42.217
<i>And it's something that I'm used to</i>

21:42.217 --> 21:44.720
<i>because back in the '80s,
that's how we made movies.</i>

21:44.720 --> 21:47.222
<i>And it's really a sight to behold.</i>

21:49.057 --> 21:50.642
Is this room safe?

21:50.642 --> 21:53.478
Yeah, this whole area
is totally abandoned.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.063
No one's around for miles.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.863
<i>Knowing that you were plucked
from a timeline</i>

22:02.863 --> 22:05.198
<i>to work at the TVA</i>

22:05.198 --> 22:08.035
just gives you a lot to wonder

22:08.035 --> 22:11.246
about who this person was before this.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.462
Casey. Thank God you're here.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.629
How'd you get here?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.465
How did I get where? Where's here?

22:21.465 --> 22:22.966
Alcatraz.

22:23.508 --> 22:28.221
<i>Being able to see Casey as a Variant</i>

22:28.221 --> 22:32.184
and doing these Alcatraz scenes

22:32.184 --> 22:33.810
<i>was awesome.</i>

22:33.810 --> 22:36.938
<i>The fact that Casey was this prisoner,</i>

22:36.938 --> 22:39.232
I thought that was the coolest turn.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.526
I remember when looking
at the script, going like,

22:41.526 --> 22:45.113
"This is not what you really want me
to do. This is amazing."

22:45.113 --> 22:47.449
You gotta find your own way off this rock.

22:47.449 --> 22:48.533
Sorry, pal.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.665
We meet Brad Wolfe in Episode 1,

22:55.665 --> 22:58.377
and he's looking
at Mobius's jet ski magazine.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.712
And part of that is him
just realizing, like,

23:00.712 --> 23:03.382
<i>"Wait a second,
there is a greater world out there</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:05.384
<i>"that I haven't really experienced."</i>

23:05.384 --> 23:08.512
<i>He's gone back in time,
he sort of gamed the system.</i>

23:08.512 --> 23:10.389
<i>He can't go back
and make</i> Star Wars,

23:10.389 --> 23:14.351
<i>he can't do something giant that's going
to change the course of history.</i>

23:14.810 --> 23:18.772
But he could go, "Well, what if I
start making comic book movies?

23:18.772 --> 23:21.566
"What if I start doing these things
before they got really big?"

23:22.567 --> 23:23.860
X-5 is an actor now?

23:23.860 --> 23:25.487
Or he's undercover.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.780
Looks pretty real to me.

23:26.780 --> 23:31.493
Behind us is the <i>Zaniac</i> premiere
in the 1970s.

23:31.493 --> 23:35.497
There's a big crowd here ready
to see movie superstar Brad Wolfe

23:35.956 --> 23:39.334
in his leading role as the Zaniac.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.503
<i>And Loki and Mobius have shown up</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:45.006
<i>to try to figure out why X-5's tracker
is leading them here.</i>

23:45.006 --> 23:48.385
<i>And they're astonished to find that
he's this completely different person now</i>

23:48.385 --> 23:50.470
<i>and they need to get
to the bottom of it.</i>

23:51.012 --> 23:53.682
How do you feel about
your meteoric rise to fame?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.559
I don't know how I feel, but I look good.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.685
Come on, look at this.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.478
Pretty darn good.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.440
I think Brad's movie is probably
not going to stand the test of time.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.942
Come on, Mobius.
You're gonna ruin my life here.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.026
Your life here?

24:06.695 --> 24:09.990
You know, getting to burst through doors
and, you know, run down alleyways

24:09.990 --> 24:12.826
<i>and jump down staircases
and go underground at times,</i>

24:12.826 --> 24:16.413
<i>and do this crazy maze
getting chased by a god,</i>

24:16.538 --> 24:18.165
is always an adventure in itself.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.583
You're doing your own stunts now?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.168
Real cute.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.256
<i>I remember
having a conversation</i>

24:26.256 --> 24:27.757
<i>with Kevin Wright, the producer,</i>

24:27.757 --> 24:30.760
<i>after we shot that scene
where Sylvie kills He Who Remains.</i>

24:30.760 --> 24:34.014
And it was the last scene that we shot

24:34.014 --> 24:36.683
in Atlanta, on Series 1.

24:36.683 --> 24:40.228
And he said to me,
"Where do you think Sylvie goes next?"

24:40.228 --> 24:43.440
And I was like,
"Where do you think she goes next?

24:44.566 --> 24:49.070
"I think she'd be really hungry."

24:49.070 --> 24:53.325
And that was my lesson in being careful
what you say to producers.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.370
Because next thing I know,
I'm in a McDonald's uniform.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.290
Ordering everything on the menu.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.625
How do I do this?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.918
What would you like?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.920
Not squirrel, not possum, not rats.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.756
Something that's already dead,
and nothing with a face.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.882
Please.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.219
<i>It's just a metaphor, really,
for Sylvie wanting</i>

25:12.219 --> 25:16.723
<i>to experience what it's like
to be in the world.</i>

25:16.723 --> 25:20.185
<i>And not to have to be
on the run the whole time,</i>

25:20.185 --> 25:23.813
not to be hiding out
in these apocalyptic places

25:23.813 --> 25:25.774
where she's constantly in danger,

25:25.774 --> 25:30.445
but to experience
what it's like to be normal.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.240
<i>She is on
a branch of a timeline,</i>

25:34.282 --> 25:37.118
<i>essentially, for the first time,</i>

25:37.118 --> 25:40.038
<i>inhabiting free will.</i>

25:40.038 --> 25:42.958
<i>She's never had it.
Sylvie wasn't supposed to exist.</i>

25:43.500 --> 25:45.418
She's not part of the Sacred Timeline

25:45.418 --> 25:48.547
so she's been on the run from the TVA
since she was a child.

25:49.297 --> 25:52.008
And... And this is her first chance

25:52.008 --> 25:55.262
to experiment with freedom, with choice.

25:55.262 --> 25:59.558
Look, Loki, as much as I'd love to see
the TVA burnt down,

25:59.558 --> 26:02.185
I have no intention of going back there.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.270
My life's here now.

26:03.270 --> 26:07.857
Sylvie realizes how much
she's missed out on

26:07.857 --> 26:13.446
and she begins to make connections
with just a few human beings.

26:13.446 --> 26:17.826
<i>And she starts to realize
how important that is to her.</i>

26:17.826 --> 26:19.744
Your friends are back where they belong.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.331
But without them...

26:26.293 --> 26:27.836
Where do I belong?

26:30.630 --> 26:32.799
We're all writing our own stories now.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.725
<i>We had a really
amazing team on Season 1</i>

26:41.725 --> 26:45.103
<i>and we wanted to retain
as much of that crew as possible,</i>

26:45.103 --> 26:47.981
<i>so production designer
Kasra Farahani</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:49.899
is production designing
Season 2 as well.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.569
He stepped into the director's chair
for one episode.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.530
<i>Same for visual effects supervisor
Dan DeLeeuw,</i>

26:55.530 --> 26:59.326
who we made a bunch of movies with
in the visual effects department.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.078
Multiple Academy Award nominee
for that work.

27:02.078 --> 27:05.415
<i>And it's been fun to watch people
step into new roles and really deliver.</i>

27:05.415 --> 27:09.002
Similarly, we had an amazing experience
on <i>Moon Knight</i> with Aaron and Justin.

27:09.002 --> 27:13.423
<i>And they've stepped in
to kind of be the anchor director role</i>

27:13.423 --> 27:16.051
<i>on this one,
directing four of the six episodes.</i>

27:16.051 --> 27:19.929
All four of our directors, you know,
Aaron and Justin, Dan, and Kasra,

27:19.929 --> 27:22.515
have been so sympathetic

27:22.515 --> 27:26.227
<i>to what we created in the first series.</i>

27:26.227 --> 27:30.899
They know that it's already
a sort of live, big beast.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.861
So they haven't come in
and just tried to change everything.

27:34.861 --> 27:39.991
But they've each subtly put their mark
on their episodes.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.535
A greater portion of our body of work

27:42.535 --> 27:46.706
is characters who grow in such a way

27:46.706 --> 27:49.125
<i>that they become less the villain
of their own story</i>

27:49.125 --> 27:50.835
<i>and more the hero
of their own story.</i>

27:50.835 --> 27:52.212
This is where it all started.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.214
<i>There's a sci-fi aspect of</i> Loki

27:54.214 --> 27:56.883
<i>that dovetails very nicely
with all of our work,</i>

27:56.883 --> 28:01.179
and in the same way that <i>Moon Knight</i>
had a lot of permission to be weird,

28:01.179 --> 28:04.641
one of the first things
that Kevin Feige ever said to us

28:04.641 --> 28:07.811
<i>when he was asking
if we wanted to do Season 2 was,</i>

28:07.811 --> 28:11.398
<i>"We don't want you to do it
if it's not gonna be something different."</i>

28:11.398 --> 28:14.234
<i>And I think that really got us
engaged with the whole thing,</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:16.736
that it can be as weird
as we would want it to be.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.739
So it's not like you're going...
Like that.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.535
It's because he's still jumping,
so it's more like you're here, down.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.413
They come from a sort of
horror background

28:26.413 --> 28:28.790
and I can tell when they're shooting

28:28.790 --> 28:31.334
<i>that they love, like,
a slow zoom-in on the face,</i>

28:31.334 --> 28:35.380
<i>they love a bit of symmetry,
they like creating atmosphere.</i>

28:35.380 --> 28:37.549
That's really fun to do as an actor,

28:37.549 --> 28:41.010
especially because you know
that it's gonna translate well onscreen.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.936
<i>When we are preparing
our shot list, or storyboards,</i>

28:49.936 --> 28:52.355
<i>or whatever it is we're preparing for
in pre-production,</i>

28:52.355 --> 28:56.067
we literally work
with blueprints, photographs,

28:56.067 --> 28:58.528
and sometimes models of these sets.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.989
So there's not huge surprises
when you walk in.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.491
<i>When we were
developing our shots</i>

29:03.491 --> 29:05.493
<i>and doing the shot list and the planning,</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:09.831
we wrote, you know, a dense,
roughly 12-page document

29:09.831 --> 29:12.000
about general visual approach.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.420
<i>And then an hour-long video cut together
of different examples</i>

29:15.420 --> 29:17.255
<i>of things that work,
things that don't,</i>

29:17.255 --> 29:18.965
<i>here's what we're gonna do
and not do,</i>

29:18.965 --> 29:21.301
<i>'cause the visual style
is different from Season 1.</i>

29:21.301 --> 29:23.553
<i>And then, our cinematographer,
Isaac Bauman,</i>

29:23.553 --> 29:27.557
took that and made a 700-page book

29:27.557 --> 29:30.310
<i>of not just references,
typed out book,</i>

29:30.310 --> 29:35.440
<i>of the entire visual language of the show
down to the smallest lights.</i>

29:37.901 --> 29:40.445
<i>When you're designing
the look of a project,</i>

29:40.445 --> 29:43.698
<i>the way to make it look
stylish and stylized</i>

29:43.698 --> 29:47.786
and have integrity, is actually to do
as little range as possible.

29:48.119 --> 29:51.247
Create as little diversity as possible
in the amount of looks you're doing

29:51.372 --> 29:53.875
so that the project
takes on a cohesive whole.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.419
<i>However, you want it
to do something different</i>

29:56.419 --> 29:58.713
<i>with all these different time periods
we're visiting</i>

29:58.713 --> 30:00.799
<i>because it was motivated, you know.</i>

30:00.799 --> 30:02.759
<i>We couldn't ignore that motivation.</i>

30:02.759 --> 30:05.720
<i>So, before we started shooting
the first episode,</i>

30:05.720 --> 30:09.599
<i>we mapped all this out,
every single time period, every set.</i>

30:10.058 --> 30:13.770
<i>Everything was calibrated to stand out</i>

30:13.770 --> 30:17.315
<i>and be specific and motivated
by the environment that it was in.</i>

30:17.315 --> 30:19.943
But also by prepping so far in advance,

30:19.943 --> 30:26.074
we made sure that every single thing
felt like a cohesive slice of the pie.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.207
First season of <i>Loki,</i>
they asked me to come in and help out

30:34.207 --> 30:36.000
in post-production
on the visual effects.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.920
<i>I fell in love with the show.
So when the opportunity came up,</i>

30:38.920 --> 30:41.965
<i>and said, "Hey, how do you feel about
doing an episode on Season 2?"</i>

30:41.965 --> 30:43.550
<i>I'm like,
I jumped at the chance.</i>

30:43.550 --> 30:47.262
The irony is that Episode 2
has the least amount of visual effects

30:47.262 --> 30:48.847
in the entire season.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.642
And the number of times
a lot of the crew came up, it's like,

30:52.642 --> 30:54.561
<i>"You know, it's weird
you're doing the show</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:56.646
"that has the least amount
of visual effects."

30:56.646 --> 30:58.565
It's like, "Yeah, that occurred to me."

30:59.566 --> 31:02.151
<i>Episode 2 is very much
a kind of a conspiracy</i>

31:02.151 --> 31:04.404
<i>and kind of a, like a thriller-esque thing</i>

31:04.404 --> 31:05.780
<i>where they have to find Sylvie,</i>

31:05.780 --> 31:08.116
<i>they need answers,
what happened at the End of Time.</i>

31:08.116 --> 31:09.701
When I first read the script,

31:09.701 --> 31:13.371
it kind of felt something, you know,
plays out like <i>The French Connection,</i>

31:13.371 --> 31:16.791
<i>from a lot of the '70s movies where you
stay in the perspective of the characters</i>

31:16.791 --> 31:18.209
<i>as they work
to solve the puzzle.</i>

31:18.209 --> 31:21.504
Dan will say, "I saw this thing
that you did in Episode 1,

31:21.504 --> 31:24.549
<i>"I remember this thing you did
in the table read for Episode 2.</i>

31:24.549 --> 31:26.718
"I don't want you to forget it.
Let's do it in take three.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.802
"Let's do two straight,

31:27.802 --> 31:30.346
"then that curveball one
where you're playing around."

31:30.346 --> 31:32.056
<i>- Zaniac.</i>
- What about it?

31:32.056 --> 31:34.183
- I wanna know about it.
- Oh, come on.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.269
- Please.
- You don't care about my movie.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.188
Brad, I saw the poster.
It looked scary.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.648
It's not. It's not.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.193
It's not scary.
It's elevated thriller, all right?

31:44.193 --> 31:45.612
- It is?
- It's cinema.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.530
Like you would know anything
about that.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.741
<i>Even though it's,</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:52.201
<i>conceptually, it's, you know,
it's like TV,</i>

31:52.201 --> 31:54.245
<i>in the sense
that you have showrunners,</i>

31:54.245 --> 31:57.081
<i>the studio is guiding the scripts,
but when you're brought in,</i>

31:57.081 --> 32:00.501
you're instantaneously brought
into the room with everyone else,

32:00.501 --> 32:02.211
where the scripts
are being developed,

32:02.211 --> 32:04.130
the writers and the producers
are there,

32:04.130 --> 32:06.591
and our other directors on this season,

32:06.591 --> 32:09.052
you're all collaborating
on everybody's episode.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.346
<i>We workshop the script,
and we'll have Tom there</i>

32:11.346 --> 32:13.514
<i>and we'll have Owen come in
and Sophia come in,</i>

32:13.514 --> 32:16.017
<i>everybody gives their perspective
on the characters,</i>

32:16.017 --> 32:19.479
and it keeps elevating the script
and elevating the script...

32:19.479 --> 32:22.106
<i>And it's always the idea,
you know, that the best idea wins.</i>

32:22.106 --> 32:25.860
A little over the top, don't you think,
all the shadow play?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.323
I thought it was spot on.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.664
I've been on this team,
on this <i>Loki</i> ride, for quite a while now.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.416
Since fall of 2019.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.336
<i>That's when we started prep
on Season 1.</i>

32:43.336 --> 32:47.215
<i>And so, when this season came about,
started back up,</i>

32:47.215 --> 32:50.009
<i>they asked me if I wanted
to participate in the writers' room,</i>

32:50.009 --> 32:53.346
which was a huge honor
and a lot of fun, and...

32:53.346 --> 32:57.225
In some ways, it made sense
because so much of the show

32:57.225 --> 32:59.978
comes out of the world
in which it's set.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.191
<i>Out of that opportunity</i>

33:05.191 --> 33:08.778
<i>came this even cooler opportunity
to direct Episode 3,</i>

33:08.778 --> 33:12.281
which is very different than the rest
of the season, I can say.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.536
<i>Kasra is doing these,
like, huge long takes</i>

33:16.536 --> 33:19.706
of really intricate scenes,

33:19.706 --> 33:25.294
<i>where he's doing just, like,
these big swooping, like, oners almost,</i>

33:25.294 --> 33:29.382
which is really cool to do
because it's a challenge.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.552
You can really get into the flow of it
when you're not cutting all the time.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.304
So we have different styles, okay?
I'm not sightseeing.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.265
You're a man of action, which is fine.

33:37.265 --> 33:40.309
I take a more slow, deliberate,
cerebral approach

33:40.309 --> 33:42.145
because I see everything.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.781
<i>The decision for this episode
to be set in the World's Fair</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:55.992
predates my involvement with the project,

33:55.992 --> 34:00.747
but I think it's sort of a very distinct
and iconoclastic setting.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.959
<i>Also, it's just a very unlikely place</i>

34:04.959 --> 34:07.462
to find the next Variant of Kang.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.380
I mean, if they're here, we'll find 'em.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.673
If they're here.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.092
Only one way to find out.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.678
<i>So this is
the Midway Plaisance.</i>

34:15.678 --> 34:18.598
<i>Some people refer to it almost
as the amusement park</i>

34:18.598 --> 34:20.600
<i>or the gift shop of the World's Fair.</i>

34:20.600 --> 34:24.228
And the Midway was sort of
the more recreational part of it

34:24.228 --> 34:27.190
where there were exhibitions
from different parts of the world

34:27.190 --> 34:31.277
<i>with a more accessible format
to working-class people.</i>

34:31.277 --> 34:33.696
How great is this Ferris wheel?

34:34.155 --> 34:36.574
Cut.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.994
As you can see, there's blue screens
on both ends of the set.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.080
<i>There will be set extension.</i>

34:42.080 --> 34:45.583
<i>But we were able to create
quite a good size chunk of it.</i>

34:45.583 --> 34:49.128
<i>And you'll see
there's Cairo, Egyptian exhibition,</i>

34:49.128 --> 34:51.422
<i>and there's a Chinese village,</i>

34:51.422 --> 34:55.093
<i>and a Norwegian longhouse structure,</i>

34:55.093 --> 34:58.513
<i>where there are the important statues
of the Norse gods,</i>

34:58.513 --> 35:00.181
from which Loki
has been excluded.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.892
You know, sometimes I forget
that you're one of them.

35:02.892 --> 35:06.646
You are one of them. Blows my mind.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.109
<i>Coming into Season 2,</i>

35:11.109 --> 35:13.653
<i>we knew we wanted
to use He Who Remains</i>

35:13.653 --> 35:16.030
<i>and a Variant of He Who Remains
in some form.</i>

35:16.030 --> 35:19.408
But we wanted
to subvert expectations with that

35:19.408 --> 35:22.578
<i>and not have that be the straight line
that people might expect.</i>

35:22.578 --> 35:25.665
<i>So when we see Jonathan there
on that stage,</i>

35:25.665 --> 35:27.375
<i>there is He Who Remains</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:29.293
<i>and it's a totally different version
of him.</i>

35:29.710 --> 35:31.879
Don't be shocked

35:31.879 --> 35:34.257
when I tell you

35:36.050 --> 35:41.264
that time is the future of...

35:43.266 --> 35:44.350
energy.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.852
He's a brilliant scientist,

35:45.852 --> 35:48.437
but he's kind of born
into the wrong time.

35:48.437 --> 35:52.733
<i>And, so, maybe someday,
he'll become He Who Remains.</i>

35:52.733 --> 35:55.319
<i>He'll become
that dangerous, formidable person.</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:59.699
<i>But right now,
he's kind of this likeable character.</i>

35:59.699 --> 36:01.325
We're doing really great here.

36:01.325 --> 36:04.370
We are here in great Chicago.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.539
My name is Victor Timely.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.501
Time is everything.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.089
<i>In terms
of the Loom itself,</i>

36:15.089 --> 36:19.719
this is essentially the prototype

36:19.719 --> 36:22.555
<i>of the Temporal Loom that ultimately</i>

36:22.555 --> 36:25.933
<i>is at the core of the TVA.</i>

36:27.268 --> 36:31.647
And the idea
is that Victor Timely's innovation

36:31.647 --> 36:35.651
in concert with the information he got
from the TVA Handbook,

36:35.651 --> 36:38.571
<i>which was filled with O.B.'s writings,</i>

36:38.571 --> 36:43.659
and it's through that process
that he arrived at this prototype Loom.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.870
My Temporal Loom

36:45.870 --> 36:50.791
inverts the temporal decay
of the electricity flowing through it,

36:50.791 --> 36:55.755
lowering its entropy and gathering it

36:55.755 --> 37:00.468
into fine, organized threads of...

37:03.012 --> 37:04.555
power!

37:05.848 --> 37:08.809
<i>And in the case
of this Victorian-era one,</i>

37:08.809 --> 37:11.854
<i>the idea is that
it's weaving strands of energy</i>

37:11.854 --> 37:16.734
<i>because this one is focused
on refining the efficiency</i>

37:16.734 --> 37:18.819
<i>of electrical output.</i>

37:18.819 --> 37:22.615
<i>Whereas the one in the TVA
applies the same sort of idea</i>

37:22.615 --> 37:24.367
<i>to strands of time.</i>

37:24.367 --> 37:26.953
So there's a similar kind
of visual language

37:26.953 --> 37:29.205
between this Loom
and the one in the TVA,

37:29.205 --> 37:32.250
<i>but this one is rendered in materials</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:36.003
<i>and construction methods
from the Victorian era.</i>

37:36.128 --> 37:39.215
All science is fiction

37:40.091 --> 37:43.636
until it's fact!

37:45.805 --> 37:48.391
Mr. Timely. A moment, please.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.602
Of course.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.604
We need to talk about your future.

37:54.188 --> 37:57.566
<i>Gugu completely understood
where we were trying to bring Renslayer.</i>

37:57.566 --> 38:01.195
<i>She could've easily fallen into villain
status and instead is a human being.</i>

38:01.195 --> 38:04.115
You're the one who sided
with a Loki over me.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.575
Don't play the teamwork card on me now.

38:06.575 --> 38:10.329
There is a really easy way
to take Renslayer that is one-dimensional,

38:10.329 --> 38:12.707
which is, she wants power,
and that's it.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.710
<i>We just pretty strongly felt
like what it really was is,</i>

38:15.710 --> 38:19.630
<i>she has been done wrong
and she genuinely has a desire</i>

38:19.630 --> 38:22.758
<i>to bring stability to the TVA,
which is important.</i>

38:22.758 --> 38:25.720
So she is an antagonist,
but I don't think she's a villain.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.887
- Miss Minutes?
<i>Yeah?</i>

38:26.887 --> 38:29.181
- This is your moment.
Get him!

38:31.475 --> 38:34.353
<i>- Boo!</i>

38:34.353 --> 38:37.857
<i>Miss Minutes is coming back
so we're gonna be seeing her quite a bit,</i>

38:37.857 --> 38:40.526
which is gonna be lovely,
to work with her.

38:40.526 --> 38:44.155
When we can get her out of her trailer.
She can be quite temperamental.

38:44.155 --> 38:49.744
<i>Well, even before the TVA
or her, you created me.</i>

38:49.744 --> 38:53.289
<i>And we worked together at the End of Time.</i>

38:53.289 --> 38:58.127
<i>I'm here because I know
what a great man you can become.</i>

38:58.127 --> 39:00.755
<i>On set, they shoot
Miss Minutes with a lamp.</i>

39:00.755 --> 39:03.549
And we have an on-set reader
who does a really great job

39:03.549 --> 39:05.760
working with the actors
to create the scene.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.262
We then go away,
myself and the director Kasra,

39:08.262 --> 39:10.848
and we cut a version
of the scene that works.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.017
<i>My assistant editors go in
and do their best</i>

39:13.017 --> 39:15.019
<i>to comp in a version of Miss Minutes.</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:17.897
And then we recorded Tara's ADR.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.066
<i>So then you refine the scene again.</i>

39:20.066 --> 39:22.943
<i>And you hope that the animation
is all going to come together.</i>

39:22.943 --> 39:26.030
Rising Sun Pictures did Miss Minutes
this season, she's phenomenal.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.823
<i>So, original orange Miss Minutes,</i>

39:27.823 --> 39:29.408
<i>they revamped her a little bit</i>

39:29.408 --> 39:31.243
<i>to give her a bit
of a different rig</i>

39:31.243 --> 39:33.746
<i>so that she had more expression
and all that stuff.</i>

39:33.746 --> 39:34.955
<i>Just watch.</i>

39:34.955 --> 39:38.125
<i>Then there's black and white
Miss Minutes that we see in Episode 3,</i>

39:38.125 --> 39:41.212
and initially, Kasra,
who directed that episode,

39:41.212 --> 39:44.715
wanted her to be fully 2D cel-animated.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.636
And we could have done it but it
would've been prohibitively expensive.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.347
<i>So we asked,
"Is there any way that you can rig this</i>

39:51.347 --> 39:53.391
<i>"so it looks like
a 2D cel-animated figure?"</i>

39:53.391 --> 39:54.517
<i>Better?</i>

39:54.517 --> 39:56.852
<i>And they were able to do it
and she looks fantastic.</i>

39:56.852 --> 39:59.980
<i>With all your powers
and all your abilities,</i>

39:59.980 --> 40:02.525
<i>you just kept me as your thing.</i>

40:02.942 --> 40:05.569
<i>Your computer, your toy.</i>

40:05.569 --> 40:08.739
<i>Instead of what I could have been.</i>

40:09.698 --> 40:13.702
<i>Your girl.</i>

40:23.003 --> 40:26.549
<i>This is
the Temporal Core control room.</i>

40:28.676 --> 40:32.471
<i>So, this set is very much influenced</i>

40:32.471 --> 40:37.768
by mid-century European
and Eastern European power plants,

40:37.768 --> 40:42.481
<i>along with some kind
of NORAD-type environments.</i>

40:42.481 --> 40:44.733
<i>As you walk through
the containment corridor,</i>

40:44.733 --> 40:49.530
<i>you're walking through a series
of three to four-foot thick doors.</i>

40:49.530 --> 40:53.576
<i>And then ultimately, when you get
to the main door into the control room,</i>

40:54.034 --> 40:57.246
<i>you know, the threshold
for that door is about nine feet.</i>

40:57.246 --> 40:59.165
And then you get in here,

40:59.165 --> 41:01.959
<i>and as you go
into the control room airlock</i>

41:01.959 --> 41:03.794
<i>and you go through the airlock door,</i>

41:03.794 --> 41:05.838
<i>there's another 8-foot deep</i>

41:05.838 --> 41:08.507
<i>concrete threshold
that you have to move through.</i>

41:09.341 --> 41:13.053
<i>The idea is that
what is outside this window</i>

41:13.053 --> 41:15.806
<i>is the most awesome force,</i>

41:15.806 --> 41:19.727
<i>something akin to a nuclear blast
or a volcano.</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:28.277
Suit up, get down the gangway
as fast as you can,

41:28.277 --> 41:31.238
load the Multiplier, hit the green button,
launch it and get back.

41:31.238 --> 41:35.034
<i>It was actually really great
shooting in here with everyone,</i>

41:35.034 --> 41:38.621
that we did a lot of days in this room.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.458
<i>We did a lot of different versions
of the same events</i>

41:42.458 --> 41:45.127
over and over again,
almost like <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

41:45.461 --> 41:49.048
Hit the green button.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.091
That's right. Now launch it.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.969
That's it, you've done it.
Get back, get back. Go, go!

41:53.969 --> 41:56.222
There were some really fun times

41:56.222 --> 41:58.349
<i>when we were all going
a little bit stir-crazy.</i>

41:58.349 --> 42:01.477
<i>Cabin fever, sort of, you know,
on the edge.</i>

42:01.727 --> 42:02.811
Yes.

42:05.272 --> 42:08.692
I've spent so many days in this room.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.821
<i>We shot this scene,</i>

42:12.821 --> 42:16.367
<i>A version, B version, C, D, E, F, G, H,</i>

42:16.367 --> 42:18.786
<i>I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P...</i>

42:19.328 --> 42:22.957
And I would go home
and I would dream about it

42:22.957 --> 42:26.126
and have to come to set
and do it all over again.

42:26.126 --> 42:28.629
And then go home and dream about it.

42:28.629 --> 42:32.383
And then come to set
and do it all over again.

42:32.383 --> 42:37.179
<i>I mean, I will always remember
the Temporal Core.</i>

42:41.308 --> 42:43.686
With the Loom,
there was quite a bit of R&D.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.938
It was more to make sure
the thing looked real.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.898
<i>Art department was incredible.</i>

42:47.898 --> 42:50.526
<i>They were the ones
that started the concept work.</i>

42:50.526 --> 42:53.070
<i>And then we handed it off
in pre-production</i>

42:53.070 --> 42:56.365
to a vendor called Trixter,
who works out of Germany.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.951
<i>And they started to try
and make this thing function.</i>

42:59.493 --> 43:01.954
<i>Initially, it was supposed to be
the size of a moon.</i>

43:01.954 --> 43:05.249
But the distance for it to be
how big we see it in screen

43:05.249 --> 43:07.918
would've had to have been
so extremely far away

43:07.918 --> 43:09.920
that it wouldn't have been functional

43:09.920 --> 43:12.214
<i>in a way for us to try and fix it.</i>

43:14.675 --> 43:18.721
<i>Benson and Moorhead were really big on us
having a lot of color in there.</i>

43:18.721 --> 43:20.973
<i>They wanted to see, like,
the full spectrum.</i>

43:20.973 --> 43:24.643
That Temporal Core lighting setup

43:24.643 --> 43:28.063
<i>was absolutely massive, it was
the biggest we did in the whole season.</i>

43:28.063 --> 43:30.441
<i>You'll see as the characters
move through that space,</i>

43:30.441 --> 43:33.527
<i>rainbow patterns slide over them.</i>

43:33.527 --> 43:34.945
You've got about five minutes.

43:35.321 --> 43:38.657
<i>And that was actually
incredibly difficult to figure out.</i>

43:38.657 --> 43:43.037
The first issue is,
no existing LED unit is capable

43:43.037 --> 43:47.833
of making a rainbow
with delineated sections of color.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.919
<i>So, the lighting department,
my gaffer Mark Taylor,</i>

43:50.919 --> 43:53.547
<i>worked with Chris Townsend,
the VFX supervisor,</i>

43:53.547 --> 43:58.677
<i>to develop with VFX tools,
a graphic design rainbow</i>

43:58.677 --> 44:02.139
that we had printed
on these tiny little plates,

44:02.139 --> 44:07.269
it looks like a petri dish
microscope slide-sized little plate.

44:07.269 --> 44:11.440
And then those,
we slid into these units

44:11.440 --> 44:13.817
that are designed mostly
for theatrical, like,

44:13.817 --> 44:18.030
moving LED, point source, spotlight
type of units.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.074
<i>And the light pushed
through the plate</i>

44:20.074 --> 44:23.994
<i>and projected, in effect,
a rainbow on the scene.</i>

44:23.994 --> 44:29.124
However, what we discovered was,
what we put in the computer

44:29.124 --> 44:30.584
and what was printed on the plate

44:30.584 --> 44:33.420
and what it looked like
when the light was shining through it

44:33.420 --> 44:35.381
were all completely different things.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.508
So we kind of
had to work backwards from,

44:37.508 --> 44:39.802
"All right, well,
this design looks like this

44:39.802 --> 44:41.470
"when it's actually
being projected."

44:41.470 --> 44:43.222
It looks nothing like the design.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.891
<i>So we had to make the designs
look all weird</i>

44:45.891 --> 44:49.895
<i>to get it to where it looked normal
in real life, on set.</i>

44:49.895 --> 44:54.900
So it took all...
It not only took all ten weeks of prep,

44:54.900 --> 44:58.487
but it took, you know,
the first ten weeks of shooting

44:58.487 --> 45:01.740
before we had moved
into the Temporal Core control room set,

45:01.740 --> 45:03.283
to trial-and-error this thing.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.035
Trust me. If you stop, you die.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.247
All right.

45:09.998 --> 45:10.999
Here we go.

45:23.178 --> 45:25.389
<i>The main objective with that suit was,</i>

45:25.389 --> 45:30.102
"Just how cumbersome
can we possibly make this thing?"

45:30.102 --> 45:35.441
<i>Believe it or not, that is not
an easy thing to accomplish in this scale.</i>

45:37.526 --> 45:38.610
You're good.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.405
You're good.

45:45.117 --> 45:47.745
<i>Just getting
the materials to work out,</i>

45:47.745 --> 45:51.832
<i>for instance, I R&D'd many different
treatments to the fabric</i>

45:51.832 --> 45:55.711
<i>to get sort of a retro look
to this canvas,</i>

45:55.711 --> 45:58.589
<i>but yet, a protective quality.</i>

45:58.589 --> 46:02.426
<i>And I thought I found it with a latex</i>

46:02.426 --> 46:06.513
<i>that we would spray onto this canvas.</i>

46:06.513 --> 46:10.350
<i>And about three weeks in,
we discovered that it was turning pink</i>

46:10.350 --> 46:13.520
<i>because the latex was reacting to UV.</i>

46:13.520 --> 46:16.231
<i>Then we had to try
to find UV-protective...</i>

46:16.231 --> 46:18.233
<i>Anyhow, the whole thing
had to get ditched.</i>

46:18.233 --> 46:21.528
<i>We had to do another, we had already
R&D'd this whole process.</i>

46:21.528 --> 46:26.533
<i>But for the Temporal Core suit,
it peels away under temporal energy</i>

46:26.533 --> 46:28.202
<i>and there was a...</i>

46:28.202 --> 46:33.207
<i>A layer underneath that was...
had this reflective quilted quality.</i>

46:33.207 --> 46:36.293
<i>Just figuring out how to get the,
you know,</i>

46:36.293 --> 46:38.962
<i>hundreds of yards of quilting
through these machines,</i>

46:38.962 --> 46:41.381
<i>we had to build
these special stretchers for it,</i>

46:41.381 --> 46:45.010
<i>so it's just endless amount
of engineering feats for that.</i>

46:45.010 --> 46:49.723
<i>And then also, just how does somebody
wear that much weight and scale</i>

46:49.723 --> 46:52.267
<i>and not look like a walkabout costume?</i>

46:52.267 --> 46:56.438
You think it's gonna be really easy
to make something cumbersome for an actor,

46:56.438 --> 46:59.274
and then you realize it's actually
not that easy.

46:59.274 --> 47:04.363
<i>There were definitely certain
trips out to the Loom launcher</i>

47:04.363 --> 47:09.451
that were meant to be comedic
in how darkly funny they were.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.245
<i>Then there was other ones
where we're just</i>

47:11.245 --> 47:13.539
<i>drawing out the tension
as much as we could.</i>

47:13.539 --> 47:16.333
<i>We knew that
the more cumbersome the journey,</i>

47:16.333 --> 47:17.876
the more painful it would be.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.379
Kind of thinking about when,
like in <i>Gravity,</i>

47:20.379 --> 47:23.799
when someone's reaching for something
and because they don't have the inertia,

47:23.799 --> 47:26.301
it's physically impossible
for them to try harder

47:26.301 --> 47:28.220
to reach something,
it was like that.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.018
Be brave. You're being so brave.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.021
<i>We've got several scenes</i>

47:38.021 --> 47:40.774
<i>where we have characters
that walk out along the gangway</i>

47:40.774 --> 47:43.151
<i>towards the Temporal Loom
in order to fix it,</i>

47:43.151 --> 47:46.321
<i>or solve a certain problem,
and as a consequence,</i>

47:46.321 --> 47:49.324
one of the things that happens
when characters walk out there

47:49.324 --> 47:51.827
is that they get affected
by the temporal energy.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.495
<i>And if they're not careful,</i>

47:53.495 --> 47:56.123
<i>and if the temporal energy
is too strong,</i>

47:56.123 --> 47:59.543
<i>they will start, their suits
will start degrading and spaghettifying.</i>

47:59.543 --> 48:01.712
<i>So, almost all the shots you see</i>

48:01.712 --> 48:04.214
<i>have got some visual effects
on the suit itself.</i>

48:04.214 --> 48:06.967
<i>And we are destroying them,
degrading them in-camera,</i>

48:06.967 --> 48:10.429
<i>and we're pulling threads out in this
sort of a spaghettification manner</i>

48:10.429 --> 48:15.642
<i>in a similar way that we've used in
other temporal, sort of, visualizations.</i>

48:15.642 --> 48:18.353
So it's something that's been
a really interesting process,

48:18.353 --> 48:19.855
trying to find that language

48:19.855 --> 48:22.149
that sort of fits in
with the idea of it decaying.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.110
<i>We shot everyone
at 40 frames a second</i>

48:25.110 --> 48:27.779
<i>so that they move
just a little bit more slowly.</i>

48:27.779 --> 48:30.908
<i>We got great performances
from Owen and from Jonathan,</i>

48:30.908 --> 48:32.618
<i>who were all in the suits.</i>

48:33.660 --> 48:35.662
Push the green button!

48:36.830 --> 48:39.499
Sometimes, the suits are all CG
in some of the shots,

48:39.499 --> 48:42.586
<i>but we tried to use the real suits
as much as possible.</i>

48:44.755 --> 48:45.923
Yes!

48:45.923 --> 48:47.341
Pumpkins.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.018
What do I do?

49:00.312 --> 49:04.274
It's the Sacred Timeline, or nothing.

49:04.274 --> 49:07.778
It's not enough
to protect the Sacred Timeline, Loki.

49:07.778 --> 49:11.281
Even down there,
it's full of death and destruction

49:11.281 --> 49:12.658
and injustice.

49:13.450 --> 49:16.787
Do you really wanna be the god
who takes away everyone's free will

49:16.787 --> 49:18.205
so you can protect that?

49:18.205 --> 49:21.750
But what good is free will
if everyone's dead?

49:21.750 --> 49:24.127
And who are you to say
we can't die trying?

49:25.420 --> 49:27.965
Who are you to decide
we can't die fighting?

49:30.342 --> 49:34.388
The thing that Tom said to me
very, very early in Season 2

49:34.388 --> 49:38.308
<i>was if this is about Loki
becoming the best version of himself,</i>

49:38.308 --> 49:40.936
<i>you can't become
the best version of yourself</i>

49:40.936 --> 49:43.981
<i>without accepting your past.</i>

49:43.981 --> 49:47.150
<i>Which means accepting all of it,
warts and all.</i>

49:47.150 --> 49:52.698
<i>And there was an interesting thing of,
like, to become a true, true, true hero,</i>

49:52.698 --> 49:57.202
<i>a guy who is never going to benefit
from any of these choices he makes...</i>

49:57.202 --> 49:59.121
<i>He's gonna get that throne
he always wanted,</i>

49:59.121 --> 50:01.415
<i>but it's not in the way
that he ever anticipated.</i>

50:01.415 --> 50:04.209
<i>He wants to be with his friends, he can't.</i>

50:04.209 --> 50:06.670
<i>To make a true sacrificial play,</i>

50:06.670 --> 50:09.673
he has got to truly understand who he is.

50:15.303 --> 50:18.181
Loki, what are you doing?

50:19.016 --> 50:20.392
I know what I want.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.064
I know what kind of god I need to be...

50:28.775 --> 50:29.776
for you.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.030
For all of us.

50:34.239 --> 50:38.660
<i>And when he steps into
the Temporal Loom and sacrifices himself,</i>

50:38.660 --> 50:41.788
I think that's a moment
that's been coming for Loki,

50:41.788 --> 50:43.331
that we haven't seen.

50:43.331 --> 50:45.917
<i>We wanted to truly have him step up</i>

50:45.917 --> 50:49.212
<i>from lowercase-G god,
to capital-G God.</i>

50:49.212 --> 50:51.298
There was a draft of the script

50:51.298 --> 50:53.050
of the very end, the very end.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.677
Something wasn't sitting right
with both of us about it.

50:55.677 --> 50:59.306
<i>And the issue was, this draft
didn't have Loki destroying the Loom.</i>

50:59.306 --> 51:03.018
<i>He saved the Loom from imploding
and then ascended the throne.</i>

51:03.018 --> 51:05.270
We all knew something was up,
we didn't know what.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.355
'Cause it was like,
he's trying to save the Loom,

51:07.355 --> 51:08.857
he gets the throne, all of this.

51:08.857 --> 51:11.943
But the problem was,
is that he didn't have the sacrifice

51:11.943 --> 51:15.113
<i>and we realized,
why doesn't he destroy the Loom</i>

51:15.113 --> 51:17.949
<i>and then have to take over
the Loom's massive responsibility?</i>

51:17.949 --> 51:19.534
<i>He doesn't get anything out of it.</i>

51:19.534 --> 51:22.913
<i>It seems so obvious now,
it seems like exactly the right choice.</i>

51:22.913 --> 51:25.832
<i>But that was a watershed moment
in the development of it,</i>

51:25.832 --> 51:29.169
<i>when we realized Loki needs
to destroy and become the Loom.</i>

51:29.169 --> 51:32.923
<i>We see
his normal clothes shed off</i>

51:32.923 --> 51:35.509
<i>and reveal his final Loki costume</i>

51:35.509 --> 51:37.594
<i>and his horns begin to grow back.</i>

51:40.806 --> 51:43.350
We've already shot Tom
climbing these stairs

51:43.350 --> 51:46.436
<i>and ascending to what will become,
effectively, his throne,</i>

51:46.436 --> 51:49.606
<i>as he then holds onto time
and holds it all together.</i>

51:50.440 --> 51:53.026
<i>That was a pretty epic sort of moment.</i>

51:58.615 --> 52:01.993
<i>Tonally, that was
a very tough costume to land on</i>

52:01.993 --> 52:05.163
because it needed
to have a monastic quality,

52:05.914 --> 52:11.002
but he also has a history
of wanting the throne, to be a king.

52:11.002 --> 52:14.005
And he's kind of
positioning himself to be

52:14.005 --> 52:18.301
looking over everything
in the manner of a king, but humble.

52:21.847 --> 52:24.683
<i>And humbled by the weight
of that responsibility,</i>

52:24.683 --> 52:29.187
so it's just figuring out how that costume
could say all those things.

52:34.359 --> 52:37.529
- The grand finale.
- The grand finale of <i>Loki.</i>

52:37.529 --> 52:39.364
- Yeah.
- Seasons 1 and 2.

52:39.364 --> 52:43.243
<i>It's resonant, it's moving,
'cause he's been through so much.</i>

52:43.243 --> 52:47.038
<i>And so much struggle
and so much suffering, and...</i>

52:48.832 --> 52:50.792
<i>So many questions.</i>

52:50.792 --> 52:54.838
And to sort of come back,
it feels like it's

52:54.838 --> 52:58.258
a reacceptance of something.

52:58.258 --> 53:01.553
Or a redefinition of himself, somehow.

53:01.553 --> 53:03.930
And I think it's interesting
that from the beginning,

53:03.930 --> 53:06.183
we always talked,
I mean, from November,

53:06.183 --> 53:09.394
- we talked about it being organic.
- Yeah.

53:09.394 --> 53:12.397
- And it is that organic part of Loki.
- Yeah.

53:12.397 --> 53:14.983
- It's real. It's a toss-up.
- It's very real.

53:14.983 --> 53:17.110
<i>It's an inter...
It's the inside on the outside.</i>

53:17.110 --> 53:18.195
<i>It is. Yes.</i>

53:18.195 --> 53:22.908
<i>So, what I love about it is,
it's familiar in its colors</i>

53:23.533 --> 53:25.660
<i>and in its shape,</i>

53:25.660 --> 53:28.246
<i>but it's new in its humility.</i>

53:28.246 --> 53:30.540
<i>- So, gone are the...</i>
<i>Armors.</i>

53:30.540 --> 53:34.127
<i>...the armor and the metal
and the breastplates.</i>

53:34.127 --> 53:36.129
- It's kind of a hybrid.
- It's more vulnerable.

53:36.129 --> 53:38.757
It is. And it's a hybrid of, like,

53:38.757 --> 53:42.135
sort of a king and... a monk.

53:42.135 --> 53:43.386
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

53:43.386 --> 53:46.431
<i>These are...
These are the robes of someone</i>

53:46.431 --> 53:50.727
<i>who might be dedicated to a purpose</i>

53:50.727 --> 53:52.938
<i>- beyond the self.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

53:52.938 --> 53:57.275
<i>And these are
the garments of purpose and practice.</i>

53:57.275 --> 53:59.277
<i>And weight.</i>
<i>And weight.</i>

53:59.277 --> 54:01.196
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

54:01.196 --> 54:03.281
<i>Was it Mobius
who says in Episode 6,</i>

54:03.281 --> 54:06.743
"Sometimes purpose
is more burden than glory.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.453
"You choose your burden."

54:08.453 --> 54:10.956
And so, this is him
accepting that mantle.

54:26.012 --> 54:29.307
<i>The first ten years of movies
with Loki was about the glory.</i>

54:29.307 --> 54:31.977
<i>He was a villain,
he was chasing a throne.</i>

54:33.353 --> 54:36.273
<i>This season is about him learning
that his glorious purpose</i>

54:36.273 --> 54:38.942
<i>is to carry the burden
of everyone else.</i>

54:39.859 --> 54:42.821
<i>He's embracing the caring person
that he's turned into</i>

54:42.821 --> 54:44.739
<i>through these two seasons,</i>

54:44.739 --> 54:47.200
but he's also embracing his past

54:47.200 --> 54:50.245
<i>and his status as an Asgardian god</i>

54:50.245 --> 54:54.499
<i>to hold everything together
and to save his friends.</i>

54:54.499 --> 54:55.875
He's giving us a chance.

54:56.293 --> 54:59.504
His magical power as a demigod

54:59.504 --> 55:02.215
is enhanced because he realizes
that this...

55:02.215 --> 55:07.679
this authority he has
over coordinating and managing time

55:07.679 --> 55:09.723
<i>is, in fact, where the story ends.</i>

55:09.723 --> 55:15.645
<i>And it's his only resistance
against the grand plan of He Who Remains.</i>

55:16.646 --> 55:19.149
There was a huge opportunity here

55:19.149 --> 55:21.860
to show a character evolve

55:21.860 --> 55:25.530
from being petty to being
someone who sacrifices for others

55:25.530 --> 55:27.532
<i>and feels the value of that.</i>

55:27.532 --> 55:31.328
And to tell that story,
especially today, was a gift.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.371
I think what was also really important

55:33.371 --> 55:36.416
is that the sacrifice
weren't just a superhero sacrifice,

55:36.416 --> 55:39.586
it was one where he never even
gets to see the benefits of it.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.547
<i>He doesn't get to save his friends
and then hang out with them.</i>

55:42.547 --> 55:44.466
<i>It is a pure sacrifice.</i>

55:44.466 --> 55:47.469
He is Atlas at the End of Time
holding it all together.

55:47.469 --> 55:51.973
<i>And then that came from wanting
to tell a story</i>

55:51.973 --> 55:54.726
<i>that had, like, a mythic weight to it,</i>

55:54.726 --> 55:58.730
<i>that's befitting the Norse mythology
that all of this is built on.</i>

55:58.730 --> 56:00.190
I remember,

56:01.191 --> 56:05.487
over two years ago,
I put this on for Season 1.

56:05.487 --> 56:08.073
And Season 1 felt like a new beginning

56:08.073 --> 56:12.077
because we were stripping Loki
of everything that was familiar to him,

56:12.077 --> 56:16.247
it was taking him away from Asgard
and Thor and Odin.

56:16.247 --> 56:19.584
<i>A new beginning,
a new story, a new chapter.</i>

56:19.584 --> 56:23.838
<i>And wearing this jumpsuit and hoping</i>

56:23.838 --> 56:28.927
<i>that the audience would accept
and be inspired by our new story.</i>

56:29.803 --> 56:33.681
<i>No matter how hard you work,
there's always that sense of uncertainty.</i>

56:33.681 --> 56:35.850
<i>You think, "Well, I hope they love it,</i>

56:35.850 --> 56:39.938
<i>"and I hope they are as excited
and interested in this new idea as I am."</i>

56:42.190 --> 56:46.277
And I feel so fortunate
and so grateful to the audience

56:46.277 --> 56:48.363
<i>'cause people really
seem to be interested</i>

56:48.363 --> 56:51.282
<i>in the ideas and the characters
and the world and the TVA</i>

56:51.282 --> 56:55.036
<i>and the performances and all these
great new actors in the MCU.</i>

56:55.036 --> 56:59.416
<i>So, my feeling
is one of immense gratitude and,</i>

57:00.250 --> 57:03.628
to be completely honest,
profound excitement.
