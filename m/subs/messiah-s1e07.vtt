[Felix] Can you believe it?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.051
[Felix] We witnessed a miracle.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.720
It did look like a miracle.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.517
It's just a lot to take in.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.645
I know it's a lot,
but the world just changed, Anna,

02:25.728 --> 02:27.564

04:26.140 --> 04:28.059
Go inside, that way.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.820
Brother Zaid is a good man. A teacher.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.405
We studied together.

04:40.863 --> 04:44.200
He is going to offer you young men

The Sheikh will come visit you soon.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.262
I'm not to leave?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.974
It's for your protection.
There are threats against you.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.602
Not just the Israelis,
but Muslim brothers, too,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.313
who don't like your "al-Masih."

05:14.605 --> 05:17.191
It's from all sides. I'm sorry.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.152
But you'll be safer here.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.570
What about the others?

So it was just a moment of desperation

05:35.793 --> 05:38.296
Looks that way.
But he's sparked off another wave.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.381
Rioting's spread to the West Bank now.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.799
When will you be back?

05:42.216 --> 05:44.719
Uh, I can't say. I'm onto something here.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.846
Eva, we need you back in Israel.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.349
I'm in Iran for at least another day.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.309
Then you'll need to get back soon.

[Eva] Payam Golshiri plays
at being this nomadic holy man,

06:01.402 --> 06:02.820
but he's not acting alone.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.989
He has resources.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.243
Intel. The private plane that he took
from Jordan to Mexico was leased

06:09.327 --> 06:12.372
by a shell company
that we traced back to Russia.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.248
And the Russian link gets deeper.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.085
Golshiri spent a semester
at Williams College

06:17.168 --> 06:19.712
when Oscar Wallace
was still a professor there.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.882
Now, as you know, Wallace has been
in hiding outside of Moscow

06:22.965 --> 06:26.552
under the Kremlin's protection
ever since he hacked the stock exchange.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.472
Now, his online posts
continue to incite his followers

06:29.555 --> 06:32.892
to carry out acts of social disruption.

06:32.975 --> 06:36.771
What if Wallace cultivated a relationship
with Golshiri at Williams

06:36.854 --> 06:37.939
and recruited him?

06:38.523 --> 06:39.982
Converted him to his ideas.

06:40.066 --> 06:44.278
What better agent of chaos
than a new messiah?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.323
You're basing this all on the fact

06:47.407 --> 06:49.992
that they happened to be
at the same place at the same time?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.495
Not just that, their ideologies align.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.748
Ideologies? Is there anything actionable?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.796
We have eyes on Golshiri 24/7,
his brother is in Iran.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.924
We're interviewing him.
Maybe he will tell us something.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.553
[sighs] Have you been watching the news?

07:09.637 --> 07:13.891
The West Bank is in full Arab Spring mode
and DC feels like Woodstock.

07:13.975 --> 07:18.020
So he has a brother, so he spent a...
a semester abroad. So what?

07:18.729 --> 07:21.357
We need to discredit
this asshole right now,

07:21.441 --> 07:24.444
and I'm not hearing anything
that sounds like real ammunition.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.528
-Sir--
-No.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.614
Give me a photograph
of Golshiri looking like a terrorist,

07:28.698 --> 07:32.076
-building a bomb, cutting off a head.
-You're not gonna find that.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.663
Cameron. We're talking
about something else here.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.331
He didn't blow up a building.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.208
He walked on water.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.836
Every time we crack down
on one form of terrorism

07:41.919 --> 07:43.796
another threat pops up in its place.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.299
al-Qaeda, ISIL, it evolves.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.677
What we're facing now is
a state-sponsored social disruption.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.388
This is a new world.
This isn't just about one man.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.223
This is a war of ideas.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.978
You can call it whatever kind of war
you like, but it looks like we're losing.

07:59.479 --> 08:04.025
The president doesn't care about
your half-baked deep-state conspiracies.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.069

08:39.101 --> 08:41.479
Perhaps we have both changed.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.985
These boys will study and learn,
like we did.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.489
They will find purpose here, God willing.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.527
All right. [sighs] So...

10:13.988 --> 10:16.907
Would you all like to discuss, um...

10:16.991 --> 10:20.119
how you are feeling
about everything that's going on?

10:21.579 --> 10:25.207
-Go ahead.
-All the histrionics, it's BS, right?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.752
Nobody really believes this guy.

10:27.835 --> 10:32.840
It's just people want an excuse
to skip class or get high or whatever.

10:32.923 --> 10:33.883
Mm-hm.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.803
I don't know. I...
I think people are being sincere.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.683
I mean, I'm afraid that he's real.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.063
Why are you afraid, Casey?

10:47.938 --> 10:51.692
Think about it. If he's real, like,
what are we supposed to do?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.779
Just give up everything
and then start worshiping him?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.911
What would it mean
for this man to be real?

11:01.994 --> 11:05.414
Well, in Islam, the arrival of the messiah

11:06.082 --> 11:08.584
means a civilization-ending war.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.878
So, if this guy is legit...

11:12.254 --> 11:14.256
we're in for a major bloodbath.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.134
[girl] Well, what if he turns out
to be Christian?

11:18.636 --> 11:20.346
Then this course is irrelevant.

much of anything,

14:37.126 --> 14:38.836
what we did have a lot of...

was faith.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.217
And maybe that's why we were rewarded.

Maybe that's why our town
was touched by God.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.823

17:17.661 --> 17:19.663

-Thank you so much, Reverend. Take care.

17:34.094 --> 17:37.306
Well, everyone's just looking
for any insight they can find.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.143
You were very collected up there.
I'm impressed.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.645
Not everyone could handle
that kind of spotlight.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.147
Thank you. That means a lot.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.399
But if you really want
to harness all this,

17:47.483 --> 17:49.026
it's gonna be a big operation.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.486

17:50.569 --> 17:51.612

17:55.491 --> 18:00.120

the message, if you'd like.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.127

19:26.623 --> 19:28.959
He could be the false messiah.

God protect us!

His followers are doomed...

19:37.092 --> 19:39.303

19:39.386 --> 19:40.262
[all] Yes!

19:42.639 --> 19:43.724
That's right.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.520
You are strong.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.064
Peace be upon you.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.568
Peace be upon you, Sheikh.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.695
How are you, my son?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.074
Why do you call me your son?

20:42.824 --> 20:44.826
I wish you were, Jibril.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.621
God honors you.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.084
And you have done great things,
despite your youth.

20:53.001 --> 20:57.047
Everything you've done
for your nation... it's astonishing.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.841
It wasn't just me.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.762
I have heard otherwise. But, no matter.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.641
Now...

21:09.518 --> 21:10.727
Please, sit.

21:20.028 --> 21:24.032
Do you have a sense of your plan,
in the future?

21:27.327 --> 21:29.329
I will trust al-Masih's plan...

21:30.038 --> 21:31.039
whatever it is.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.086
My son, I'm not asking for his plan.
I'm asking for yours.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.089
What is <i>your </i>will, Jibril?

Gets you an audience.

Just a populist politician with an ax

24:31.178 --> 24:34.181
My mentor used to say
there's no room for doubt.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.099
You can't blink.

24:37.350 --> 24:41.396
Lives are at stake. You have
to see things as good or bad. Or...

24:42.814 --> 24:43.773
black or white.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.652
And you believe that?

24:49.654 --> 24:50.655
Yeah.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.037
So, what am I?

Am I a good guy or a bad guy?

of being the bad guy.

Aren't we all?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.554
So, how did your mentor survive all this?

35:47.186 --> 35:48.729
[siren blaring]

36:01.951 --> 36:03.327
I'm callin' the cops.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.627
Why are you followin' me?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.881
We are going in the same direction.

36:16.799 --> 36:20.178
You know, sometimes your answers
are annoying. People don't like it.

36:20.678 --> 36:24.015
Plus, I'm not goin' anywhere specific.
That's the point.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.642
I just couldn't take
being in that hotel anymore.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.937
It's okay for you to ask me
what you want to ask.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.692
That woman in the hotel, who was she?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.361
A lost soul.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.198
It looked like she knew you pretty well.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.660
You are not going to understand
everything that happens.

36:45.244 --> 36:48.539
You have to trust that I have
a special place for you, Rebecca.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.927
[sirens continuing]

37:09.393 --> 37:11.520
Feels like we're on the edge of somethin'.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.441
Like nothin's gonna be the same again.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.153
That's not a bad thing.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.366
Sometimes...

37:27.078 --> 37:30.206
I have thoughts about all this
comin' to an end.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.253
But they're more than just thoughts.

37:37.672 --> 37:38.881
They feel real.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.678
They are.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.061
[glass smashes]

38:03.239 --> 38:04.865
[Keon, in Arabic] False Prophet.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.920
If I asked you something impossible,
would you do it?

38:23.509 --> 38:24.385
Yes.

38:25.928 --> 38:28.055
Then you have to shed your burdens.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.975
The pain, the shame.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.062
Leave it all behind, strip it all away.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.024
Only then you can speak your truth.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.694
Do you understand?

38:42.278 --> 38:43.154
Yes.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.197
It won't be easy.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.449
No, I can do it.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.484
[man] <i>My brother</i>
<i>always liked to tell stories.</i>

39:21.984 --> 39:23.527
He was always such a liar.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.323
Payam.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.367
[laughs]

39:30.368 --> 39:32.578
Always loved to be
at the center of the room.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.748
Now he's at the center of the world.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.420
Is that what he always wanted, then?

39:41.504 --> 39:43.214
Even when you were young?

39:43.297 --> 39:45.341
It likely had to do with our upbringing.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.761
There's no good record of your parents.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.932
They were killed, while fleeing Iraq.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.602
We were just kids. This was 1990...

39:57.728 --> 39:58.771
1991.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.525
Our father was Jewish.
Our mother, Christian.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.947
Wasn't safe for us during the...
"liberation" of Kuwait.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.493
Does Payam blame America
for the death of your parents?

40:13.494 --> 40:16.122
This, my friend, you will have to ask him.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.667
After they died,
what happened to you and Payam?

40:20.626 --> 40:22.753
We were raised here in Iran
by our uncle.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.046
In Tehran?

40:24.130 --> 40:25.047
[clicks tongue]

40:25.131 --> 40:26.674
Our uncle dragged us all over.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.801
He was a...

40:29.969 --> 40:31.095
how do you call?

40:31.595 --> 40:32.721
Vagabond, yes?

40:33.597 --> 40:34.473
A trickster.

40:35.057 --> 40:38.185
Sometimes, we would travel
with the circus, during the summers.

40:38.727 --> 40:43.566
Other times, we'd busk in markets,
run scams. Pickpocket.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.068
We would sleep on the street.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.406
We were always ready to flee
with the rags on our backs.

40:52.074 --> 40:56.287
He called himself "Yusuf the Magnificent."

40:56.370 --> 40:57.872
[laughs]

40:58.414 --> 41:01.459
Ah! Can you imagine? Magnificent!

41:03.711 --> 41:05.254
He was proud and cruel.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.675
Put us to work from the very beginning.
Pulled us from school.

41:09.758 --> 41:10.634
Beat us.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.305
But he also taught us everything he knew.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.724
English.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.434
Books.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.062
The art of illusion.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.780
Uncle Yusuf was a magician.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.033
A master.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.994
And we were his apprentices.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.959
The trick... it's not so much
the mechanics of it.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.254
That's just... practice.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.507
The real trick...

41:55.513 --> 41:56.931
is making you believe.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.150
[bell tolling]

42:08.943 --> 42:10.152
[paper tearing]

42:20.829 --> 42:22.414
[siren wailing]

42:56.407 --> 42:59.660
You're not sleeping in your car anymore?

42:59.743 --> 43:00.619
No.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.121
No, found a room.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.039
-In a hotel?
-Yes.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.166
-With running water?
-Yes.

43:06.959 --> 43:09.878
Yes. Well, you won't believe it, actually.
It's this hotel.

43:10.921 --> 43:11.797
Really?

43:12.590 --> 43:14.967
[phone chiming]

43:20.931 --> 43:22.391
Uh, what'd you get?

43:55.215 --> 43:56.592
[scraping]
