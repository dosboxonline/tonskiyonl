WEBVTT

01:06.167 --> 01:08.337
Hold your end up higher.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.699
- You're not holding it.
- I am too.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.638
- You are not.
- Don't worry about me.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.484
Mmm.

01:16.677 --> 01:20.507
- Isn't that suit charcoal?
- No.

01:20.548 --> 01:24.148
Looks charcoal gray to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.585
You'd think you could

01:25.619 --> 01:27.619
find a black suit for
your own father's funeral.

01:27.655 --> 01:30.485
- It's black.
- No. I'm sure it's gray.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.364
- It's black. Black.
- Gray. Gray!

01:32.393 --> 01:33.863
- Black!
- Fine, it's black.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.429
It's the grayest black
I've ever seen.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.425
- Doesn't matter
what color it is!
- Oww!

01:44.538 --> 01:46.268
I'm sorry, Pop.
I'm sorry!

01:49.443 --> 01:52.213
[ thunks, splashes ]

01:59.520 --> 02:01.490
Quick!
Get him out of there!

02:01.522 --> 02:03.762
He's halfway to
the harbor by now, bub.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.791
Ah, well.

04:10.484 --> 04:14.694
[ man ] "I leave you
not just a model factory,

04:14.722 --> 04:18.791
but something
infinitely more valuable.

04:18.826 --> 04:23.956
The future of string...
itself."

04:23.997 --> 04:27.837
- [ explosion ]
- [ indistinct shouting ]

04:33.874 --> 04:37.044
"And thus it is
my dying wish

04:37.077 --> 04:41.347
that my two sons run
Smuntz String together."

04:41.382 --> 04:44.722
Great. Let's stick a
"For Sale" sign on the lawn
and see what we can get.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.952
Ernie, we're not
supposed to sell it.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.787
We're supposed to
run it together.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.732
Either way, this
Godforsaken museum piece

04:51.759 --> 04:53.959
is not worth a dime,
now is it, Lars?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.604
Some things are more
important than money, Ernie.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.470
Notice it's always
the financially challenged
who say that?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.501
Uh, please, please.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.937
"I also bequeath to you
my personal effects,

05:06.974 --> 05:11.314
including my ceramic egg...

05:14.081 --> 05:17.521
...half box of Cuban cigars...

05:17.551 --> 05:20.091
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:20.120 --> 05:25.460
- My collection of spoons."
- [ clattering ]

05:25.493 --> 05:29.363
[ Ernie ] My goodness, what
a treasure. What a legacy.

05:29.397 --> 05:32.397
Spoons! Spoons!

05:32.433 --> 05:34.473
So many spoons,
so little time.

05:34.502 --> 05:38.772
Oh! And, of course,
something no household
should be without.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.136
The ceramic egg!
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.654
Can I have the egg?
Can I? Huh? Huh? No.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.818
- I want you to have it.
- Fine, I'll take it!

05:47.848 --> 05:51.418
If you find any real estate
on that desk, let me know.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.392
It seems there is also a house.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.922
- [ together ] A house?
- Yes, 5120 Nortondale.

05:56.957 --> 06:02.597
[ chuckles ] Your father
acquired it many years ago
as payment of a debt.

06:02.630 --> 06:06.700
He never lived there,
but it's interesting.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.004
It seems the previous owner

06:09.036 --> 06:11.736
was found locked
in a trunk in the attic.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.912
Wait a minute.
Is it worth anything?

06:13.941 --> 06:18.081
He was able to borrow $50,000
against it to pay his workers.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.481
Really? So what
is its value today?

06:20.514 --> 06:23.624
$50,000.

06:23.651 --> 06:28.191
Great. A worthless house and
a broken-down string factory.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.761
Oh, well. At least the day
wasn't a total loss.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.392
Thanks for the stogies, Pop.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.666
Wait. You can't go. We have
to go through all these papers.

06:43.236 --> 06:48.476
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got a date with the mayor.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.949
- [ thunderclap ]
- [ reporters chattering ]

06:53.581 --> 06:57.181
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor,
over here! Mr. Mayor!

06:57.217 --> 06:59.087
Do you think your recent
triple heart bypass

06:59.119 --> 07:01.019
will affect your
campaign strategy?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.994
Now, Leslie,
I'm just here to eat.

07:04.792 --> 07:09.902
Ah, Monsieur  Maire,
Madame Maire,
welcome to Chez Ernie.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.900
[ French accent ]
Ah, what an honor it is to
have you in my humble bistro.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.774
Suivez-moi.
Oh, you brought the little ones.

07:16.804 --> 07:21.114
The little bicycle thieves.
Bonjour! Our very best table.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.911
- Have you lost a little weight?
- Oh, I...

07:23.944 --> 07:26.084
I think so!
I think you may be buff!

07:26.113 --> 07:29.183
[ laughs ] Je suis enchantÃ©
pour vÃ´tre beautÃ©.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.116
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, Monsieur Ernie...

07:32.152 --> 07:35.962
[ chuckles ] Excusez-moi.
Au revoir, les enfants!

07:38.225 --> 07:41.825
[ sighs ] The air's
not so thin at the top.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.904
Just like the old man to die
before I hit it big.

07:49.870 --> 07:54.070
Remember, everyone.
Attention to detail is vital!

07:54.107 --> 07:58.707
Presentation is everything.

07:58.746 --> 08:02.646
No, no, no, no, no!
These I must deliver myself.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.553
[ roars ]

08:12.092 --> 08:15.132
Duck a l'orange avec du
quack sauce...

08:15.162 --> 08:18.732
And, for ze mayor,
la spÃ©cialitÃ© de la maison,

08:18.766 --> 08:22.936
lobster loaf Ã  la Ernst
ou la bibliothÃ¨que.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.040
- Oh...
- Bon appÃ©tit.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.242
[ exhales ]

08:28.776 --> 08:30.136
Ah, bonjour!

08:30.177 --> 08:31.807
How does it feel
to be serving the mayor

08:31.845 --> 08:33.674
on the eve of his
reelection?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.024
Well, Leslie...

08:35.048 --> 08:37.078
- May I call you Leslie?
- Ah, of course.

08:40.888 --> 08:44.888
Crunchy! Hmm.
I love the almonds.

08:44.925 --> 08:48.155
Leslie, cuisine,
she is a fickle mistress...

08:48.195 --> 08:52.065
- Ee-yew! Look!
- [ squishing ]

08:52.099 --> 08:54.999
- A cockroach!
- [ shocked whispering ]

08:56.303 --> 08:58.313
That's only
half a cockroach.

08:58.338 --> 09:03.678
- Daddy! You ate the head!
- Honey, are you OK?

09:14.855 --> 09:19.025
[ screaming ] Not again!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.929
[ reporters ] Was this an
accident, or did you murder...

09:21.962 --> 09:23.802
Clear!

09:23.831 --> 09:27.941
- I can do that better!
- [ crying, blubbering ]

09:36.276 --> 09:40.076
[ man ] Smuntz String
is a relic of history.

09:40.113 --> 09:44.723
You don't make string by twining
two strands together anymore.

09:44.752 --> 09:49.162
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.889
But that's not string.
That's cord.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.125
- Exactly.
- Twine is yesterday.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.831
- Single-strand cord is today.
- Zeppco International

09:56.864 --> 09:59.234
has been interested in
your factory for years,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.066
but your father
refused to sell.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.871
We are hopin' you'd be
a little smarter.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.173
Zeppco is willin'
to buy you out,

10:05.205 --> 10:08.305
and bring this museum
into the 21st century.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.111
'Course, we would keep you on
as a string consultant,

10:11.144 --> 10:13.784
with a huge salary
and a hefty pension.

10:14.848 --> 10:19.888
So...
What do you say?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.387
[ sighs ]

10:40.273 --> 10:43.883
- My sons...
- [ whispers ] Ernie.

10:43.911 --> 10:48.421
- Ernie!
- Yeah. Just a sec.

10:48.448 --> 10:52.888
I want you...
to have... something.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.190
My most prized possession.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.863
[ sighs ] Oh,
it's a piece of string.

10:59.893 --> 11:04.933
Not just any string.
The string.

11:04.965 --> 11:09.935
I found it
my first day in America.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.200
What's with the string?

11:11.238 --> 11:14.238
It's been in my pocket
for 60 years.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.214
Here! I want
you two to share it.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.914
Maybe it'll bring you
closer together.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.148
You haven't
talked much lately.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.493
- Yeah. [ grunts ]
- Ah! What are you doing?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.289
- I'm breaking it in half.
- No!

11:28.321 --> 11:31.121
- No?
- I want you to share it.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.488
- Forever.
- Sure, Pop, sure.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.127
Here, you carry it the first
50 years, I'll take it the next.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.204
- Sure.
- Turn up the morphine drip.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.973
I heard that.

11:45.305 --> 11:49.235
Promise me...
that you will never sell...

11:49.276 --> 11:52.406
...Smuntz String...

11:52.445 --> 11:55.915
...to one of those
big conglomerates.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.819
Keep it between you.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.962
Brothers. Family.

12:01.989 --> 12:06.429
- Promise.
- I promise, Pop.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.299
- [ Lars's voice ] I promise.
- So you were sayin'?

12:11.431 --> 12:15.441
- I'll have to pass.
- What?

12:17.270 --> 12:21.110
A world without string
is chaos.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.354
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

12:27.380 --> 12:30.550
- No, no! Don't!
- Oh!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.993
You... You used to love string!

12:33.020 --> 12:35.260
That was before,
when I was dating

12:35.288 --> 12:37.418
the son of a wealthy
string magnate!

12:37.457 --> 12:40.927
Not now, when I am married
to the half-owner

12:40.961 --> 12:43.331
of a worthless deathtrap!

12:44.965 --> 12:47.865
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.871
April, I've got
new ideas for the factory.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.944
You know,
I've got big plans!

12:52.973 --> 12:57.043
Don't you see, Lars? That's
all you've ever had are plans.

12:57.077 --> 13:02.117
But my life is passing me by,
and I... I need more!

13:02.149 --> 13:06.489
There's no air in the middle
class. I can't breathe here.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.519
- Please, April, don't go.
- [ sighs ]

13:09.556 --> 13:12.326
I'm not going anywhere.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.335
In a few brief moments,

13:30.377 --> 13:32.377
the joy of the holidays
was shattered,

13:32.412 --> 13:35.082
and the world changed
for many people.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.945
Mayor McKrinkle died this
afternoon at 4:30 p.m., at our
Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.887
Doctors here say the
official cause of death is

13:42.923 --> 13:46.633
heart failure due to the
mayor's recent culinary
disaster.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.229
And, once the hottest
restaurant on the wharf,

13:49.262 --> 13:53.272
Chez Ernie has been condemned
and scheduled for demolition.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.200
I don't think I ordered my
cheese sandwich with capers.

13:56.236 --> 14:00.006
- Live to Leslie Reinhart
for an update.
- I'm sorry.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.880
If there is a villain in this
tragedy, it is Ernie Smuntz.

14:02.910 --> 14:06.450
- Once the whiz kid of the
local restaurant scene...
- You're on TV again!

14:06.479 --> 14:08.579
What? Oh.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.175
You know what this is?
I'll tell ya.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.988
- Guilt by accusation.
- No capers.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.321
No capers? But that's
just grilled cheese.
What's the point?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.287
Why don't they
eat out of a trough?

14:19.326 --> 14:23.926
Which one of you palateless
sheep sent my sandwich back?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.465
- Hi, Ernie!
- Lars?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.340
[ sighs ]

14:29.369 --> 14:32.109
[ Ernie ] When I'm
in the kitchen, I cook.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.369
I can't control every single
thing that goes on in there.

14:34.407 --> 14:38.247
[ Lars ] It really isn't fair
for everybody to blame you.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.948
You didn't do
anything wrong.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.180
Yes, but society always
needs someone to persecute.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.916
A scapegoat,
someone to demonize.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.023
The same thing
happened to Galileo.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.155
Really?
That's unbelievable.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.630
With a cockroach
and everything?

14:52.659 --> 14:55.929
No. The point is,

14:55.963 --> 14:58.033
I put everything I had
into that restaurant.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.425
It was my livelihood
and my home.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.697
In one fatal bite, it was
all taken away from me.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.305
If only we could
sell the factory.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.608
I'd let you stay with me,
you know, but, uh,

15:08.641 --> 15:12.711
- April threw me out.
- Oh, that's too bad.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.515
Yeah, well, don't worry
about me, though, Ernie.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.588
This is temporary.
April's been like this
since high school.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.958
- She'll be back. I...
- Would you look at them?

15:21.989 --> 15:25.529
Sleeping in the street.
Pitiful.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.960
If I had a house,
I'd sleep in it!

15:30.998 --> 15:34.498
Ernie, do you remember how
close we were as kids?

15:34.534 --> 15:35.974
No.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.413
Hey! Merry Christmas!

15:40.140 --> 15:42.280
Yeah, I was on top once too.

15:42.309 --> 15:47.049
But there's only one way
to go from there, and that's
down, baby, down!

15:47.080 --> 15:50.350
- Oh, ho!
- [ coins clattering ]

15:50.383 --> 15:52.393
Ernie.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.619
Ernie! Ernie, there was
a quarter in there.

15:56.656 --> 16:01.226
- * Christmas Eve will find me
- A quarter? You think so small.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.201
Look at the bigger picture.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.230
You have no home, you have
no wife, you have no money.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.366
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

16:09.402 --> 16:13.712
- * I'll be home for Christmas
- Ernie, it's Christmas.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.040
Instead of dwelling on
what we don't have,

16:16.076 --> 16:18.376
we should be thankful
for what we do have.

16:18.411 --> 16:24.121
* If only in my dreams

16:25.152 --> 16:27.522
[ woman ]
That was very good.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.371
[ Ernie ] What a dump.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.442
[ creaking ]

17:22.675 --> 17:26.675
Wow! I can't believe Pops
never told us about this house.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.448
It's huge.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.223
[ Ernie ] This is just the kind
of house I'd expect him to have.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.593
It's just like him.
Cold and spooky.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.330
[ rustling ]

17:40.360 --> 17:44.100
- Wow! Did you feel that?
- What?

17:44.131 --> 17:48.271
I got a chill. You shouldn't
talk about Pop like that.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.201
Really?
What's this do for you?

17:51.238 --> 17:56.308
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

17:58.511 --> 18:01.211
He didn't mean it, Pop.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.786
Ernie! Ernie!

18:13.493 --> 18:16.463
Only one bed.
I'll flip you for it.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.096
Heads.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.236
[ ringing ]

18:39.852 --> 18:42.562
- [ scratching ]
- Ernie?

18:42.589 --> 18:46.829
- Ernie. Ernie.
- [ groaning ]

18:46.859 --> 18:49.459
You asleep?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.556
- I was.
- [ scratching continues ]

18:51.598 --> 18:53.568
How can you sleep
through that?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.470
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh. That.

18:56.503 --> 19:01.273
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.238
[ scratching continues ]

19:04.277 --> 19:07.907
[ creaking ]

19:21.761 --> 19:23.901
Mothballs.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.242
[ screaming ]

19:28.268 --> 19:30.938
- Hey, stop it!
- Hey! Ow!

19:30.970 --> 19:33.410
[ grunting ]

19:39.812 --> 19:43.382
[ whispering ] Ernie! Ernie!

19:43.416 --> 19:45.346

19:47.320 --> 19:51.820
- [ exhales ]
- [ rattling ]

[ grunts ]

20:11.444 --> 20:16.884
- [ thunderclap ]
- [ screaming ]

20:22.555 --> 20:25.355
Wait. Wait a minute.
Stop. Stop!

20:25.392 --> 20:28.562
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.725
[ panting ]

20:33.966 --> 20:37.836
- [ screaming ]
- Ah, shut up!

20:39.906 --> 20:43.876
[ scratching ]

20:44.977 --> 20:47.377
It's coming from up there!

20:49.882 --> 20:54.722
- One, two, three!
- [ grunting ]

20:58.758 --> 21:01.488
Ooh! [ panting ]

21:01.528 --> 21:04.898
- It's just a mouse.
- What?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.341
It's just a mouse.
Never mind.

21:08.368 --> 21:12.708
- [ grunting, groaning ]
- Hey, there are some
posters up here.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.309
Oh! Stand still!

21:15.975 --> 21:18.945
- [ smashing ]
- Ah!

21:21.514 --> 21:27.554
- [ screaming ]
- [ spitting ]

21:29.356 --> 21:31.956
- They're blueprints.
- Wow!

21:31.991 --> 21:35.731
Wait a minute.
Look at this date. 1876.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.802
A centennial house could
actually be worth something.

21:38.831 --> 21:42.341
Look, this must be the
architect. Here, look.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.509
Charles Lyle LaRue.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.476
Charles Lyle LaRue.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.379
Charles Lyle LaRue?

21:52.412 --> 21:54.812
[ thumps ]

21:55.915 --> 21:59.015
Charles Lyle LaRue.

22:00.587 --> 22:04.357
Charles Lyle LaRue!

22:04.391 --> 22:07.131
Charles Lyle LaRue!

22:07.159 --> 22:12.599
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

22:12.632 --> 22:16.402
- It's bold yet subtle.
- Classical yet nontraditional.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.736
The missing LaRue.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.881
The rumored design completed
shortly before his committal
is a rumor no more.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.709
Before his committal?

22:24.744 --> 22:27.054
[ chuckles ] Well, I'm just
glad he finished the place

22:27.079 --> 22:29.879
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.146
[ guffaws ]

22:32.184 --> 22:36.624
So, what do you think
a magnificent edifice
like this is worth?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.027
Properly restored,
of course.

22:39.058 --> 22:43.628
Well, his Parma Charnel
House went for six,

22:43.663 --> 22:45.033
but that was ten years ago,

22:45.064 --> 22:47.104
and it didn't have this
exquisite molding.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.103
I see. I can't get enough
of good molding.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.874
Did you hear that?
$600,000.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.977
- [ exhales ] Ernie.
- Alexander Falko!

22:58.978 --> 23:02.948
Back! Gentlemen,
congratulations.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.122
Congratulations
on your find.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.561
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.
Glass of rainwater, please.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.888
Mr. Falko is the world's
leading collector of LaRues.

23:11.924 --> 23:16.004
Sort of like collecting stamps,
but they're bigger, right?

23:16.028 --> 23:18.798
I'll get to the point. LaRue.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.901
I have his books.
I have his letters.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.873
- You see these shoes?
- [ together ] LaRues?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.773
No, but I'm sure
he would have loved them.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.975
Vegetarian snack.
I own... [ chewing ]

23:29.008 --> 23:33.548
...forty-two LaRue houses.
Forty-two. I want to make it 43.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.920
You tell me how
I'm going to do this.

23:35.948 --> 23:39.018
Tell me how I will do this.
You help me. How will I do this?

23:39.051 --> 23:41.021
Well, I'm, uh,
glad you asked.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.023
His, uh, Parma Charnel
House went for six,

23:44.056 --> 23:46.726
but that was ten years ago,
and it didn't have this molding.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.499
A find like this in today's
market is worth twice as much.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.870
- He's a LaRue connoisseur.
- Guilty as charged.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.940
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.909
No, no, no, no, no.
I couldn't possibly be so crass
as to allow you to do that.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.110
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.982
- Auction?
- Auction?

24:05.011 --> 24:07.881
It'd be grossly unfair
of us to deprive others

24:07.914 --> 24:10.124
of the chance to bid
on the missing LaRue.

24:10.149 --> 24:15.689
Um... May I have just one moment
with my brother, please?

24:15.722 --> 24:18.462
- Sure. Of course.
- Excuse me.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.192
- What is this?
- It's the first...

24:22.228 --> 24:24.758
- What is this? No!
- The first I've heard of...

24:26.866 --> 24:28.636
What are you doing?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.638
What am I doing? I'm
answering your prayers.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.540
These pigeons are ripe
for the plucking.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.672
Put them in a room together.
Try and outbid each other?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.737
We can make $700,000,
$800,000 easy.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.176
[ sighs ]
Oh, man, smart!

24:38.210 --> 24:40.910
- [ bangs ]
- Ooh!

24:40.947 --> 24:43.247
- You're going to get this one.
- Don't talk to me! Shh!

24:43.282 --> 24:46.852
So when is the, uh, earliest
we can set the auction?

24:46.886 --> 24:50.816
Well, I suppose all
arrangements could be
completed within the week.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.957
- A week it is.
- Great!

24:52.992 --> 24:56.262
- You're smarter than you look.
- [ together ] Thank you.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.867
But know this.

24:59.899 --> 25:04.269
I have never paid more than ten
million for a house in my life!

25:19.218 --> 25:24.018
- OK, see you then.
- Yeah. Thanks for stopping by.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.729
Ten million linen napkins.

25:31.764 --> 25:36.174
Five million bales of
top-grade cotton fiber.

25:36.202 --> 25:41.242
Forty thousand hot lamps
complete with rotating
plate-warming trays.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.183
Two thousand twine threaders,
gleaming under real lights.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.110
[ feet pattering ]

25:46.145 --> 25:48.745
[ Ernie ] My own chain of
five-star gourmet restaurants.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.851
[ Lars, echoing ] April can have
anything she's ever wanted!

25:51.884 --> 25:55.764
[ Lars ] Cars, coats, china.
She loves china.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.588
[ fan blades whooshing ]

25:57.624 --> 26:00.664
[ Ernie ] I'm gonna build an
Olympic-sized swimming pool

26:00.693 --> 26:03.663
and fill it with piÃ±a coladas
and a college sorority.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.670
[ Lars ] If only Pop were
here to see this house!

26:10.703 --> 26:13.213
He did. He just wasn't
smart enough to sell it.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.969
Lars, we've turned a corner.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.107
Our future is
staring us in the face.

26:17.143 --> 26:22.183
All we have to do is grab it,
baste it and scarf it down!

26:32.058 --> 26:35.188
Aha! We've finally found
our friend's home.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.727
Well, I bought a little
present for ya, buddy.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.870
It's just
a little mouse.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.970
Do we really
have to kill it?

26:43.002 --> 26:46.812
Yes. Listen to me. A single
vermin can bring you down.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.909
- Believe me, I know. Ah!
- [ snapping ]

26:56.683 --> 27:00.323

27:11.130 --> 27:14.970

- [ snapping ]
- [ gasping ]

27:25.311 --> 27:27.981
[ sighs ]

27:36.188 --> 27:40.258
- I trust you slept well.
- Oh! Like a baby.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.702
[ sniffs, grunts ]

27:49.368 --> 27:52.138
Hey, last night, did you
happen to hear the, uh...

27:52.171 --> 27:56.141
- Oh, yeah. Let's see.
- Yeah.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.915
Well, where'd he go?

28:04.951 --> 28:07.721
I don't know.
Maybe it snapped by itself.

28:09.221 --> 28:13.331
I don't believe it.
He snapped the trap,

28:13.359 --> 28:17.199
ate the olive, and left
the pit just to mock us.

28:17.229 --> 28:21.329
I think you're giving him
a little too much credit.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.997
Mice don't mock. They don't
have a sense of humor or irony.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.767
He's not sitting in his hole
in a smoking jacket

28:27.807 --> 28:31.177
sipping cognac, and giggling
to himself, "I left the pit."

28:31.210 --> 28:34.750
The trap snapped itself, the
olive flew off, and he ate it.

28:34.781 --> 28:37.281
It's that simple. But now
that he knows we're here,

28:37.316 --> 28:39.346
he won't come within
a mile of us.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.085
I don't think we'll be seeing
any more of that... mouse!

ya stupid nitwit?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.473
Don't! Give me that!
Don't let him get away!

28:58.404 --> 29:03.344
[ panting ] Yeah! [ laughs ]

29:04.276 --> 29:09.176
- Aah-ha-ha!

Ow!

Ow!

29:25.264 --> 29:27.904
Are you trying
to kill me?

Let me see!

29:36.142 --> 29:41.282
- Can you see him?
- Get me my Gouda.

29:44.550 --> 29:48.890
- Careful, careful!
- Don't. Don't touch me.
You'll snap it.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.991
- You're not doin' it right.
- Please, let me concentrate.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.834
[ Lars ] Put it on carefully.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.560
[ Ernie ] I'm putting it on
carefully. Relax. It's cheese.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.227
Bon appÃ©tit.

[ claps hands ]

30:02.101 --> 30:05.471

care of that. Huh?

30:08.908 --> 30:13.108

30:19.051 --> 30:21.991
Oh! Oh!

30:27.259 --> 30:32.969
Hey! Hey!

32:18.504 --> 32:20.114

32:50.802 --> 32:53.172
Lars! Gimme a hand with this.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.410
[ Lars ] Are you sure
this tub fits in
with the rest of the house?

33:01.447 --> 33:04.247
Jacuzzi tub, Lars.
It's a Jacuzzi tub.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.793
And this isn't just a house.
It's a LaRue.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.748
Of course it fits in
with the dÃ©cor.

33:08.787 --> 33:12.187
- Luxury is timeless.
- How much, Ernie?

33:12.224 --> 33:15.294
[ sighs ]
It was a steal at $1,200.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.527
[ Lars ]
Twelve hundred dollars?

33:17.563 --> 33:20.203
You spent our
last money on a tub!

33:20.232 --> 33:21.802
[ Ernie ] A Jacuzzi tub!

33:21.833 --> 33:24.043
You have to spend money
to make money.

33:24.070 --> 33:27.510
And they threw in the
cardboard lady just to
sweeten the deal.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.511

- [ sighing ]
- Well...

34:17.156 --> 34:20.856
[ Lars sighing ] Don't you
think this is a little much?

34:20.891 --> 34:24.302
Never underestimate
your opponent.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.674
Let's say he has
mastered a way

34:27.699 --> 34:30.168
to empty a mousetrap
without getting caught.

34:30.202 --> 34:33.112
If he snaps
one of these babies,

34:33.139 --> 34:36.679
a chain reaction will
start snapping them all.

34:36.708 --> 34:40.348
He'll panic,
and the law of averages says
one of them has to nab him.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.217
[ sighs ] Not bad.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.820
Yes. Well, I like to use
both sides of my brain.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.763
Come on. Let's hit
the sack. [ grunts ]

35:26.792 --> 35:29.562

- Shut up.

- I dunno.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.787
That was good.

36:54.346 --> 36:57.216
Shh! He's goin'
for the cherries!

37:00.319 --> 37:02.889
- You said mice like Gouda.
- Not in the morning!

37:02.921 --> 37:05.561
Cheese tires them out.
They need fruit for energy.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.627
[ screaming ]

37:12.030 --> 37:17.040
- [ whimpering ]
- [ whirring ]

37:17.068 --> 37:18.438
[ sighing ]

37:24.576 --> 37:27.846
- [ screaming ]
- [ Ernie ] Oh, no!

37:30.982 --> 37:33.622
- Ow!
- Ow.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.534
[ grunts, groans ]

37:48.767 --> 37:51.797
- Aah...
- Ow! D-d-d-d-d-d-d.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.476
There he goes!

38:02.113 --> 38:05.623
- Juice!
- Got it!

38:07.753 --> 38:11.393
[ laughing maniacally ]
This game is over!

38:11.423 --> 38:13.763
- Wa-hoo!
- Oh...

38:13.792 --> 38:15.762
Aah!

38:15.794 --> 38:20.334
- [ vacuum motor sucking ]
- [ laughing ]

38:27.105 --> 38:28.805
- I think it's working!
- Yeah.

38:33.412 --> 38:37.082
- [ thump ]
- Whoa! Uh! I felt something.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.445
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.115
Keep sucking!

38:41.152 --> 38:43.822
[ sloshing ]

38:47.659 --> 38:50.999
- [ grunts ]
- Goddamn, that mouse stinks!

38:51.029 --> 38:56.439
- Yeah. Dead animals always do.
- [ laughing ]

38:56.468 --> 38:59.538
- Ohh! [ laughing ]
- [ maniacal laughing ]

39:07.045 --> 39:09.645
- [ Lars ] Keep sucking, Ernie!
- [ rumbling ]

39:09.681 --> 39:12.581
[ Lars ] Oh, yeah,
this'll get him!

39:12.618 --> 39:14.548
[ groaning ]

39:15.587 --> 39:17.657
[ squirting ]

39:34.773 --> 39:38.483
- What's this?
- We're foreclosing
on your house.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.580
You've quit paying
your mortgage.

39:40.612 --> 39:44.122
Oh, wait a minute. I think
there's been some mistake.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.679
This house is paid for.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.017
No, it was paid for,
but you borrowed against it.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.523
If you don't pay the $1,200
overdue, we repossess it.

39:51.557 --> 39:55.187
- Twelve hundred dollars?
- Well, how long do we have?

39:55.226 --> 40:00.726
One week from, uh,
five days ago.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.566
[ panting ]
But, uh, that's two days!

40:03.602 --> 40:07.572
We don't have the time
or energy to deal with
these petty problems now.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.636
We're in the midst of
an extensive renovation.

40:09.675 --> 40:12.905
Looks like you're off
to a great start.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.523
Ask your boss at Rimpy's
for an advance.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.218
You can pay him back
after the auction.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.719
Ask your workers to forfeit
their salaries for a few weeks?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.152
You are the boss.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.217
If you hadn't spent
our money on that tub,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.026
we might be able
to pay the mortgage.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.498
- Doesn't help to start crying.
- [ shrieking ]

40:29.528 --> 40:33.028
No, Fluffy! No!

40:33.064 --> 40:35.974
No! I want my kitty!

40:36.001 --> 40:40.771
No, no, no!

40:48.547 --> 40:50.447
[ ringing ]

40:53.118 --> 40:55.788
- [ meowing ]
- That one's cute.

40:55.821 --> 41:00.991
- Nah. He doesn't have
that killer instinct.
- [ purring ]

41:01.026 --> 41:03.056
[ meows ]

41:03.094 --> 41:07.074
[ bell ringing,
buzzing, hissing ]

41:10.702 --> 41:13.202
[ ringing ]

41:16.942 --> 41:18.982
Morning, gentlemen.
I'm Maury.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.910
Anything I can
help you with?

41:20.946 --> 41:23.576
Uh, hi, Maury.
We need a cat.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.715
- [ cats yowling ]
- Find the one you want,

41:26.752 --> 41:29.622
and I'll spay
or neuter it myself.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.115
Well, these are
all kittens.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.257
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.064
That's a switch. Most people
like the cute little ones.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.067
- Experience with what?
- Mouse hunting.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.769
All cats are good mousers.

41:42.801 --> 41:46.071
But we have huge rats,
the size of sumo wrestlers.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.974
Lots of them, so we need
a ferocious feline,

41:49.007 --> 41:51.677
preferably with a
history of mental illness.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.050
I'm talkin'
one mean pussy.

41:54.079 --> 41:57.219
Yeah! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

41:57.248 --> 42:00.148
Do you have any of those
knocking around your cages?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.845
Funny you should ask.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.687
I had all but given up
on anyone wanting him.

42:04.723 --> 42:08.193
We were about
to gas him again.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.797
- Again?
- Again?

42:10.829 --> 42:14.669
He's spent most of his whole
life in that box, I expect.

42:14.700 --> 42:17.740
- [ growling ]
- Catzilla?

42:17.769 --> 42:19.769
The guys who clean up
call him that.

42:19.805 --> 42:22.565
But, uh, you can call him
anything you want.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.978
I'd say he looks
like a Fluffy.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.980
[ snarling ]

42:28.980 --> 42:33.150
Ah, poor little Catzilla.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.354
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

42:36.387 --> 42:40.257
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.761
- [ yowling ]
- You're a stupid cat,
aren't you?

42:42.794 --> 42:45.764
- [ growling ]
- [ chuckles ] Yes, you are.
And you're ugly.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.767
- Extremely ugly!
- [ yowling ]

42:47.799 --> 42:49.999
[ electricity crackling ]

42:51.369 --> 42:55.339
- Oh! Oh, you little bastard.
- We'll take him.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.383
- [ grunting ]
- [ cat screeching ]

43:00.411 --> 43:04.921
- Here, boy.
- [ growling ]

43:08.687 --> 43:13.757
- [ squeaking ]
- [ yowling ]

43:14.726 --> 43:16.756
Ooh... He's got
the scent now.

43:16.795 --> 43:19.325
Yeah, uh,
go get him, boy.

43:19.364 --> 43:23.674
Oh, easy, easy,
easy, easy!

43:23.702 --> 43:25.972
- [ smashing ]
- Oh!

43:31.376 --> 43:34.706
Wow. I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

43:35.847 --> 43:39.047
- [ together ] Almost!
- [ laughing ]

43:39.951 --> 43:43.251
[ growling ]

43:44.790 --> 43:49.190
[ growling ]

44:06.011 --> 44:12.121
[ roaring ]

44:16.722 --> 44:19.222
[ meowing ]

44:26.431 --> 44:30.171
[ notes playing ]

44:41.179 --> 44:43.309
[ cat yowling ]

44:45.917 --> 44:48.217
[ Ernie ] It's time to stop
worrying about that mouse,

44:48.253 --> 44:50.823
and start thinking about how
we're going to locate $1,200.

44:50.856 --> 44:53.826
[ Lars ] Don't worry, Ernie.
The workers will help us out.

44:53.859 --> 44:56.859
[ panting ]
You see, the truth is,

44:56.895 --> 45:00.795
we don't actually
have any money.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.302
Aww!

45:10.241 --> 45:14.411
We may have to defer
your next paycheck or two.

45:14.445 --> 45:16.815
- [ moaning, shouting ]
- So my brother and I can pay

45:16.848 --> 45:20.118
the mortgage on the house.
It's the missing LaRue!

45:20.151 --> 45:23.491
[ Lars ] I mean, there's no
need for violence, you know.

45:24.890 --> 45:28.290
[ Lars ] Put that thing down.
Whoa!

45:38.003 --> 45:40.273
[ banging ]

45:48.179 --> 45:50.149
Ernie! [ panting ]

45:50.181 --> 45:54.051
- What's the matter?
- Well, the, uh, the workers.

45:54.085 --> 45:56.915
They didn't react as
positively as I had hoped.

45:56.955 --> 45:59.855
[ shouting ]

45:59.891 --> 46:03.261
No? Uh, what are you doing?

46:03.294 --> 46:05.264
You could fit through
this window, right?

46:05.296 --> 46:10.366
- What? Wh... I guess so.
- Come on. [ screaming ]

46:11.837 --> 46:13.097
Aah!

46:14.272 --> 46:17.182
Oh, but, Lars,
that was our last resort!

46:17.208 --> 46:20.108
We're gonna have to find
the money someplace else.

46:38.063 --> 46:39.873
Gosh, it's a shame
nobody's interested

46:39.898 --> 46:44.068
- in buying the factory.
- Yeah, yeah, it's a shame.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.602
But who'd be stupid enough
to buy the factory, right?

46:46.637 --> 46:49.267
[ chuckling ] Yeah.

46:54.079 --> 46:57.319
[ growling ]

47:03.188 --> 47:05.118
[ yowling ]

47:18.436 --> 47:21.406

48:00.578 --> 48:02.078
[ surprised meowing ]

48:09.120 --> 48:11.890
[ sad meowing ]

48:33.979 --> 48:37.079
Ah, you must be, Caesar.

48:37.115 --> 48:40.145
Well, Mr. Caesar, uh, glad you
could get here so quickly...

48:40.185 --> 48:42.145
Shh!

48:44.422 --> 48:47.592
[ tapping echoes ]

49:07.312 --> 49:09.452
[ sniffing ]

49:13.118 --> 49:14.418
You have mice.

49:16.354 --> 49:18.264
He's good.

49:18.289 --> 49:23.489
[ whispering ] 5120 Nortondale.
January 4. 0800 hours.

49:23.528 --> 49:26.458
Don't forget to get
toothpaste and Saran Wrap.

49:26.497 --> 49:28.527
We're in sort of a hurry.

49:28.566 --> 49:30.266
I want to warn you
about this mouse.

49:30.301 --> 49:33.401
[ shouting ] Yeah.
You got asbestos, all right.

49:34.572 --> 49:37.212
I'll bet it's up in
the ceiling, mostly.

49:37.242 --> 49:43.082
Shouldn't take me more than
a day or two to remove it.

49:43.714 --> 49:46.224
[ mouthing words ]

49:46.251 --> 49:51.691
[ shouting ] OK, then.
Um, so we're gonna go upstairs.

49:51.722 --> 49:54.762
[ shouting ] All right,
well, we'll all go upstairs.

49:54.792 --> 49:56.732
- Yeah.
- [ stomping ]

49:58.463 --> 50:00.503
OK, then. Yeah.

50:05.303 --> 50:06.673
What are you doing?

50:08.606 --> 50:11.406
- He's not listening anymore.
- Oh.

50:11.442 --> 50:14.652
Good. Well,
you're the expert.

50:14.679 --> 50:17.379
I just hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

50:17.415 --> 50:20.685
We've been trying to catch
this little menace all week.

50:20.718 --> 50:24.458
Here's your problem.
Normal people are not

50:24.489 --> 50:28.189
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

50:28.226 --> 50:31.456
You have to get
inside their mind.

50:31.496 --> 50:35.426
You have to know
what they want, need.

50:35.466 --> 50:38.136
You have to think like a mouse.

50:38.169 --> 50:41.739
If you can do that,
if you can think like a mouse,

50:41.772 --> 50:44.342
you can anticipate their moves.

50:44.375 --> 50:48.705
Then, boom!
Sayonara mouse.

50:48.746 --> 50:52.276
- [ sighs ]
- Well, got some great stuff...

50:53.584 --> 50:56.524
- Whoa! Never touch that!
- [ screaming ] Whoa!

50:56.554 --> 50:59.594
- All right!
- What is it?

50:59.624 --> 51:05.734
- [ panting ] The big one.
- It's a flea bomb!

51:05.763 --> 51:10.273
- Works on mice too.
- Yeah? Well, it better.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.771
Because we can't handle
any more intrusions.

51:12.803 --> 51:15.673
Sure. That's how
you perceive it.

51:15.706 --> 51:21.806
But, to that mouse,
you are the intruder.

51:22.513 --> 51:25.523
[ shouting ]

51:33.758 --> 51:36.858
If we work fast,
we can make enough string
to meet our orders.

51:36.894 --> 51:39.464
That's the spirit. Just a few
cases, so we can keep the LaRue.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.427
- Good luck.
- Wait! Where are you going?

51:41.466 --> 51:43.696
- Aren't you gonna help?
- I have to run a errand.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.574
All you have to do
is make $1,200 worth.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.243
How long can that take?

51:47.272 --> 51:49.672
Light a match. They're
frightened by fire.

51:49.707 --> 51:52.107

[ grunting, groaning ]

54:06.744 --> 54:10.324

12 centimeters long.

54:29.066 --> 54:32.896
With a... hmm...

54:34.839 --> 54:38.809
What's this?
A slight calcium deficiency.

54:38.843 --> 54:41.953
That's interesting.

54:48.819 --> 54:51.759
Uh, hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

54:51.789 --> 54:54.019
This the business representative
for Zeppco International?

54:54.058 --> 54:57.828
Vinny? Hi, Vinny. Oh, I'm
glad I can call you Vinny.

54:57.862 --> 55:02.402
Uh, my brother and I
have decided to reconsider
your generous offer.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.873
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

55:04.902 --> 55:07.102
Oh, no, not at the office.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.907
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

56:18.543 --> 56:21.153

56:21.178 --> 56:25.648
- [ thud ]
- [ chiming ]

56:36.093 --> 56:41.003
Uh, you must be
Mrs. Lars Smuntz?

56:41.031 --> 56:45.671
- I'm afraid that status
is in transition.
- Oh, well, is Lars in?

56:45.703 --> 56:50.813
- I'd like to discuss
preparations for the auction.
- The auction?

56:56.246 --> 56:59.476
[ panting ]

57:05.990 --> 57:09.860
Careful, Lars.
You might catch a cold.

57:09.894 --> 57:12.464
April!

57:14.832 --> 57:18.642
You look like you could
use some warming up.

57:23.741 --> 57:28.981
[ Caesar ] 1300 hours.
I've activated the
Squeak Seeker 2000.

57:29.013 --> 57:31.783
I'm about to join
with the prey.

57:47.932 --> 57:50.842
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the plasma screen.

57:50.868 --> 57:52.798
Stand by.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.550
Junk.

58:13.658 --> 58:15.728
Nothing works.

58:52.863 --> 58:54.303
Ah, nuts!

58:55.800 --> 58:57.600

and pelvis. Now move!

Twelve hundred dollars.

59:46.316 --> 59:48.616
Lie still, Mr. Smuntz. You've
been hit by a bus.

59:48.653 --> 59:52.663
- I feel fine. What time is it?
- You may have had a concussion.

59:52.690 --> 59:55.130
- We're gonna do X rays.
- You don't understand, doc.

59:55.159 --> 59:57.289
I have to get out.
I might still have a chance.

59:57.327 --> 59:59.197
We saved your hat.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.629
- I'm sorry. Are you family?
- Yes, we are sisters.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:03.997
Great. There's paperwork

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.944
- I need for you to fill.
- He an organ donor?

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.910
Don't let them.
I don't know them.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.068
Oh, I'm Hilde,
and this is Ingrid.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.707
We are hair models
from Belgium.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.383
Belgian hair models.
How exotic.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:16.351
Listen to me, doc.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.820
I need to find a phone before I
miss out on the deal of my life.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.750
- Your brother's delirious.
- I am not their brother!

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:25.217
- I don't have any sisters!
- Ernie, are you OK?

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:26.855
I came as soon as I heard.

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.391
Why are you wearing
a pink overcoat?

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:34.355
Because April gave us
the $1,200!

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:42.108
Gave you the money? Don't think
she heard about the auction?

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:46.279
No. I didn't even tell her
about the auction until
after she took me back.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:51.820
She just showed up at the
factory, took off her coat
and begged me to take her.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:54.419
[ sighs ]
We made love in a way

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:57.091
I've only ever seen
in nature films.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:59.421
Wow. I almost
can't believe it.

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:03.356
I'll be able to open up
another restaurant,
you're back with April,

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.163
and you'll even be able to
keep that worthless factory.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:09.096
You know it's funny that you
call the factory worthless,

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.803
because, well,
there's something

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:14.196
I probably should've
mentioned before...

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:18.808
Yeah? Well, I guess I have
something to confess too.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.377
Hey, isn't that
Caesar's truck?

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:37.432
- Oh, my God!
- Caesar! What happened?

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:38.961
Please, sir.
He's not well.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.826
Try to think.
Did you kill the mouse?

01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.795
What's that? Horse?

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:46.773
- Fiendish! I won't eat it.
- No.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:53.178
[ clicking teeth,
squeaking like a mouse ]

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.350
How'd you find him?
Where was he?

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:58.349
- 911 call. No voice.
- [ Caesar ] Exterminate them!

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.422
We could hear screaming
in the background.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.350
He was locked in a trunk
in the attic.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.086
We'll call you
if we get any leads.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:24.881
[ rewinding ]

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:31.854
- What's that?
- [ footsteps, door creaking ]

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:34.792
[ Caesar on tape recorder ]
Put that down. What is that?

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:36.849
[ yelling ]

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.817
[ muffled groaning,
crashing sound ]

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.016
That tickles!

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:42.857
[ screaming, glass breaking ]

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.825
I don't think we're dealing
with an ordinary mouse.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.039
[ crashing ]

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:03.111
My kitchen!

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:13.123
Looks like Caesar decided
to make himself a sandwich.

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:19.402
[ Ernie] Pickles,
arugula and capers.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:23.529
He toasted the side
with the cheese,

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:28.967
but not the other side,
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.880
How did he know that?

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.320
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.551
Aha!

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:24.130
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:33.068
[ grunting ] Lars, I'm stuck!

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.313
Get me out of here!
I can't breathe!

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:39.179
- I'll get a flashlight.
- Hurry!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.453
- OK, Ernie, I got it!
- I can see that.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:52.616
Wh... Oh!

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:57.486
Hang on, Ernie.
The flashlight's broken.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:07.473
- OK, Ernie. I got a light.
- Great.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:12.437
[ sniffing ]

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:15.976
[ Ernie ] Lars,
do you smell something?

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.015
Smells like gas.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:23.946
[ Lars grunting, groaning ]

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:36.694
[ both whimpering,
muttering angrily ]

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.171
What are you gonna do?

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:49.413
I'm gonna kill that unspeakable
thing once and for all.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:52.139
- Come on, Ernie, no, no...
- Stand back, Lars!

01:06:52.176 --> 01:06:54.106
I'm a man on a mission!

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:57.584
Look, this is how accidents
happen! Come on, Ernie.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.384
Put the gun down.
Calm down. Come on.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:02.186
I'm gonna blow his
furry little head off,

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:05.059
and I'm gonna splatter his
devious little mouse brain

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:07.159
from here to kingdom come!

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:09.191
No, no! You're gonna
blow a hole in the wall.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:10.726
- Come on!
- It'll be worth it!

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.700
Think of the auction!
For God's sakes!

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:16.230
Think of the money, Ernie!
The money?

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:18.696
They're gonna cut our price
if there's holes in the walls.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.335
- The money?
- Yeah, the money, the moola.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:26.679
- [ Ernie ] There he goes.
- Shoot! Shoot!

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.420
Yes... You hit the piano!
You hit the piano!

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:36.591
- Look...
- Shh!

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:51.435
What are you, crazy? You're
blowin' the whole house up!

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:53.738
The only thing you haven't
hit is the mouse!

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.810
Why don't you give somebody
else a chance with that gun?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.680
- You're doing a wonderful job.
- [ rolling sound ]

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.490
Whoa! You got him!

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:16.626
- [ laughing ]
- [ Lars ] Get him!

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:23.403
- See you in hell, mouse!
- [ laughing ]

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.569
Fire!

01:08:54.531 --> 01:09:00.671
- God, I hate that mouse.
- [ phone ringing ]

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:04.906
[ phone ringing ]

01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:07.511
[ Ernie on answering machine ]
When you hear the beep,
start talking.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:12.754
[ Vinny on machine ]
Mr. Smuntz, this is
Vinny from Zeppco calling.

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:16.721
We waited in the square
for over an hour,
but you never showed.

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.792
We do not appreciate
being treated this way,

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:23.593
especially after your brother
already turned down our
generous offer.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:27.197
Consider our
proposal withdrawn.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.738
- Betrayed by my own brother!
- Betrayal?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:38.642
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.475
You should have told me
about that offer!

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.580
- Half that factory is mine.
- And half is mi...

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:49.754
And half is mine, including the
half that you tried to sell.

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:52.586
Yes, and would've, if it hadn't
been for that stinkin' bus!

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:56.592
Bus? You can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:58.596
You ruin everything!

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.328
Me? You...
You blame me for this?

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:03.965
Well, look! You blew
a hole in the floor!

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.840
Yeah, well, I distinctly
remember somebody yelling,
"Shoot! Shoot!"

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.541
Yeah, well, you've never
listened to me before!

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:13.014
- And you know why?
- Why?

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.682
Because I have
no respect for you!

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.652
Spending your whole life
in that stupid factory!

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.853
It's tragic.

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.785
Think I didn't have other things
I wanted to do with my life?

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:27.321
You think I didn't have
ambitions of my own?

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:30.927
- Come on. You loved string.
- I didn't love string!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.530
Could've fooled me. You and Pop
always huddled together

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.273
running some piece of something
through your fingers.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.500
It didn't matter what I did.
I didn't even exist!

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:41.765
I made him my special rack of
lamb for his 70th birthday...

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:44.265
- [ sighing] Oh, no!
- Yes! You remember.

01:10:44.308 --> 01:10:48.408
I slaved over that meal, making
sure everything was perfect.

01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:53.315
Did he say, "Thanks, Ernie,
it was delicious"? No.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:56.850
He only noticed the string
I had tied it with.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:02.359
He was crazy!

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:05.362
But I still wanted his approval.

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:09.325
I didn't leave, Lars.
I was cast out.

01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:12.344
There you go again!

- And I hate you!

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.550
- Not as much as I hate you!
- Yeah?

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:30.886
Yeah. Double. Double!

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.626

You killed him!

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:49.770
I didn't even know
he was there!

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.506
Think of all the trouble we
could have saved ourselves,

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.742
if we just threw fruit at him
in the first place!

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:57.608
[ Lars ] Oh, look!
He's still breathing!

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:00.547

- Let him have it.

- I...
- What are you waiting for?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.560
I can't just hit him
with a shovel.

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:11.602
- Why not?
- Look at him. He's pathetic.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.928

He's Hitler with a tail.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.803

just lying there.

It just doesn't feel
very sportsmanlike.

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:40.764
We better do something quick!
I think he's coming to.

- Yes.

Well, it wasn't easy,
but we finally made it.

Mm-hmm. Ernie, I want
you to have something.

I'm glad you kept it.

wanted us to share it.

now, he'd be proud of you.

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.303
Keep the champagne coming, boys.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.344
The more they drink,
the higher they bid.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.809
Hey, you boys put on
quite a shindig here, huh?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.910
- Thank you so much, Mr. Falko.
- [ moaning ]

01:15:57.754 --> 01:16:01.264
You know, it would be
very, very sad,

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:05.130
if you boys put on this
auction and nobody bid.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.361
That'd put a crimp in our
evening, but I don't think

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.827
there's any danger of that.

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.766
I don't know.
There's a lot of Eurotrash

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.801
out there
scarfin' up the shrimps.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:20.941
I tell you what. You
call off the auction, now,

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:26.047
and I will write you
a check for ten millions.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.292
As insanely generous as that is,
I have to decline,

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:35.991
but I do appreciate
your thoughtful concern.

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:38.355
Enjoy the party.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.674
Are you interested
in spooling?

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:43.998
Oh, sure. My father...

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.373
I mean, my brother and I
own a string factory.

01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:50.043
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:54.343
I would love to see
your factory sometime.

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:57.147
- Really?
- [ doorbell rings ]

01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:00.051
Oh, hello, April.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.153
What a surprise. Just dropping
by for no reason, I suppose?

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:06.816
Does a wife need a reason?
Oh, are you entertaining?

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:10.156
- Don't you mean ex-wife?
- Not quite yet.

01:17:11.828 --> 01:17:16.298
- Hakuna matata.
- This crÃªpe, c'est magnifique.

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:20.242
- The raisins are a nice touch.
- They are good, aren't they?

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:22.907
Raisins?

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:51.074
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.340
We are about to
start the auction.

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.809
Lars, I don't know whether
to congratulate you

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.082
or wish you luck.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:02.049
- Wish us luck!
- Hello, April.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:04.708
- Oh, hello.
- Nice to see you again.

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:07.048
I didn't know you
knew our lawyer.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:09.393
It's just an expression.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:14.018
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.227
for joining us for
this momentous occasion,

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.859
the auction of our
one item up for bid,

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:21.895
the missing LaRue.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.200
Before we start, I would
like to introduce you

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:29.235
to the very fortunate owner
of this architectural wonder,

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:32.712
Mr. Ernest Smuntz.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.955
Thank you, all,
for coming.

01:18:47.991 --> 01:18:52.101
When my father left
this extraordinary house

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:54.728
to my brother Lars...

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:01.774
...and myself, uh, we

01:19:01.805 --> 01:19:05.135
had no idea what surprises
were in store for us,

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:08.214
or what was
going to happen next.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:22.555
[ clearing throat ] Uh, when
Quincy Thorpe, of the, uh,

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.901
historical society, told us
of its value, you, uh...

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:33.474
You could have knocked us
over with a feather.

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:38.212
We didn't know what hit us.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:45.448
The renovation was exhausting,
but ultimately rewarding.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:50.091
- The house was in
terrible disrepair.
- [ indistinct murmuring ]

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:54.259
- Nothing that a few nails...
- [ banging, pounding ]

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:07.567
...and some old-fashioned
elbow grease couldn't fix.

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:10.073
I'm sure the people are eager
to get to the bidding.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:11.836
- What? The bidding?
- The bidding!

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:14.835
- The bidding!
- All right. Thank you.

01:20:14.878 --> 01:20:17.178
Thank you, Mr. Smuntz.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.820
No matter what happens,
keep going.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:34.304
Built in 1876, the last
LaRue known in existence

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.270
has five bedrooms...
[ indistinct ]

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.969
- Did you see him? I thought so.
- Yes!

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:42.472
- He ate the string.
- What?

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:45.105
The string.
Pop's lucky string!

01:20:45.141 --> 01:20:47.141
The son of a bitch ate it!

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.606
Why didn't you tell me
you saw him?

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.854
I didn't,
but I found this.

01:20:52.115 --> 01:20:54.145
I told you
you should've weighed him.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.453
I'm sorry.

01:20:56.652 --> 01:20:58.422
Did you see
where it went?

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.224
No, but it can't
have gone far.

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:03.626
Well, shall we start
the bidding at one million?

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:07.959
Now, we all know we're here
to bid on the missing LaRue.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:11.197
Shall we start
the bidding at $500,000?

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:15.914
Very good.
I have $500,000 from
the gentleman from Japan.

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:18.509
Can I hear a million?
Can I hear one million?

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.911
- A million.
- I'll give you one and a half.

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:25.075
I have $1.5 million.
Will someone give me two?

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:27.654
[ gasping ] There he is!

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:30.593
[man] Ladies and gentleman,
I'd like to remind you

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:33.559
that all the carpets and
tapestries were woven by hand

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:35.659
in the Honess Valley
in northern Turkey.

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:37.361
Oh!

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:42.133
[ man] Can I have an advance
on 1.5? May I have two?

01:21:42.165 --> 01:21:45.625

Can I have an advance? Can I
have an advance on two million?

01:21:56.612 --> 01:21:58.482
Oh, you look so beautiful.

01:21:58.514 --> 01:22:01.324
[ man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to draw your attention

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:06.260
to the Lincrusia details
of the gold and silver-leafed
copper and pewter...

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:09.993
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have an advance?

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:13.696
An advance on two million?
May I hear three million?

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:17.069
I have three million from
the lady from New York City.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:21.370
- What are you doing?
- Uh, uh, uh... Nothing!

01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:24.414
Get your hand
out of there immediately!

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.610
Wait! Wait just a minute!

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:33.245
- Wait!
- May I hear
four million dollars?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.682
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:37.617
[ man ] Four million,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:41.563
- [ man ] Four million.
- Four million from
the gentleman from Japan.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:43.960
I got it!

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.431
Uh, uh, the Sheikh
bids five million.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.166
Thank you, sir.
I have five million.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.641
- [ hysterical laughing ]
- Five million.

01:22:55.671 --> 01:22:58.071
Can I have an advance
on five million?

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:00.277
Ladies and gentlemen,
five million.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.309
Can I have an advance?

01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:04.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the missing LaRue.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.783
The bidding stands at five
million, ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.246
[ Lars ] I've got you now,
my little friend!

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:12.416
Hold on tight.
I'm gonna get it out!

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:14.615
OK.

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:16.587
Uh, five million
for the missing LaRue.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:19.355
- Have you got it yet?
- I'm not sure.

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:22.395
[ man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have an advance on five?

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:24.231
Will someone give me
six million?

01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:26.367

Six million dollars?

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.650

Thank you, sir.

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:46.716

Seven million dollars,
I have seven.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:57.771
- [ spectators screaming ]
- Keep her away from the walls!

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.270
- The house is priceless!
- Keep goin'!

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:02.567
Can I have 7.5?

I have eight million
over there.

01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:12.081
Eight million going once,
Eight million going twice...

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:15.315
Eight million? Eight million?
You should have taken the check!

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:18.151
You shut up! You...

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:21.357

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:30.601
Sixteen million
from Ernie Smuntz.

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:34.503
- No!
- Seventeen million.

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:38.637
Seventeen million. I have
17 million. Any advance
on seventeen?

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:50.685
Good idea.

01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:57.457
When I tell you to,
turn it on full blast.

01:24:57.493 --> 01:24:59.163
We'll flush him out.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.830

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.348

01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:28.619
- Twenty millions.
- Twenty million.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.887
Thank you.
Can I hear 21?

01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:53.453
Twenty-one million from
the gentleman from Japan.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.320
Any advance?

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:01.685
Twenty-two million.
That's my last offer.

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:07.931
[ man ] Twenty-two million
going once...

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:15.239
- Twenty-five millions.
- Twenty-five millions.

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:22.554

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:33.563
Twenty-five million
going once...

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:37.894
Twenty-five million
going twice...

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.942
[ all screaming ]

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.990
- Going... going...
- [ indistinct grumbling ]

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:13.603
Hey! Don't go!

01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:17.299
The water was just a...

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:23.413
A demonstration of how durable
a LaRue really is.

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.540
How about that?

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:30.745
Now you know this house
will last forever.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:48.928
[ laughing ]

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:43.687
- Pop's lucky string.
- I guess we got him.

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:49.662
Yeah, I guess we did.

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:43.613
[ snoring ]

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:02.974
[ machinery starting ]

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:19.522
What was that?

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:34.997
Lars! Look!

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:09.064
It's string.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:18.014
It's cheese.

01:31:44.567 --> 01:31:46.737
The entire factory
has been retrofitted

01:31:46.769 --> 01:31:49.709
to facilitate the manufacturing
of cheese-based products.

01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:51.308
I see.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:54.739
And over here we're developing
our new lactose-free line.

01:31:54.777 --> 01:31:57.047
- What is that?
- Oh, that's quality control.

01:31:57.079 --> 01:32:00.049
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:05.287
Oh. No good, huh?
Otis, more curry.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.090
OK. Try this one.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:12.232
Huh? It's mozzarella
and herring.

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.230
You can taste the herring,
right?

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:17.272
I've also got a great idea
for a caviar-Brie swirl,

01:32:17.299 --> 01:32:19.939
and a peanut butter and jelly
provolone for the kids.

01:32:19.968 --> 01:32:22.908
What I want to talk to you about
is expansion and marketing.

01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:24.938
I think you should be
our spokesperson.

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:27.583
I know some people who've used
a mouse as a spokesperson,

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:29.240
and it seemed to
work out well.

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.107
You see, I want to
turn this into the

01:32:31.146 --> 01:32:33.816
string cheese factory
of tomorrow, today...
