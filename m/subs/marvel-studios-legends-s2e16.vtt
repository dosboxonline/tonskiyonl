WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:34.617
I am Loki of Asgard.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.578
You were born to be king.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.662
LOKI: I should be king.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.997
He's always been jealous of Thor.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.375
And I am burdened with glorious purpose.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.127
Last chance, Variant.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.420
I beg your pardon.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.924
MISS MINUTES:
Welcome to the Time Variance Authority.

00:50.884 --> 00:55.472
Long ago, the Time-Keepers
created the Sacred Timeline.

00:55.638 --> 01:00.602
But sometimes, people like you veer off
the path the Time-Keepers created.

01:00.685 --> 01:05.023
We call those Variants.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.943
Variant L1130, AKA Loki Laufeyson.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.154
-How do you plead?
-(CHUCKLES)

01:12.030 --> 01:13.573
Should you return, what are you gonna do?

01:13.656 --> 01:15.408
Claim my throne.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.619
MOBIUS: Maybe I can
offer you something better.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.413
A fugitive Variant's been
killing our Minutemen.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.709
LOKI: And you need the God of Mischief
to help you stop him?

01:24.793 --> 01:25.794
MOBIUS: That's right.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.087
Why me?

01:27.170 --> 01:28.588
The Variant we're hunting is...

01:29.005 --> 01:30.090
you.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.801
-I'm Sylvie.
-You changed your name. Brilliant.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.886
-It's called an alias.
-It's not very Loki-like.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.014
Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?

01:38.098 --> 01:41.184
LOKI: Independence, authority, style.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.644
SYLVIE: You're not a serious man.

01:42.727 --> 01:43.978
You're right. I'm a God.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.189
You're a clown.
You got drunk on the train.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.565
Another!

01:47.649 --> 01:49.317
I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.904
The plan you interrupted
was years in the making.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.573
LOKI: What, your glorious purpose?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.409
SYLVIE: The universe wants to break free,

01:59.744 --> 02:01.579
so it manifests chaos.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.499
Like me being born
the Goddess of Mischief.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.292
Dragon swoops towards the palace.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.044
The TVA showed up...

02:08.128 --> 02:09.170
There's our Variant.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.841
SYLVIE: ...erased my reality,
and took me prisoner.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.092
No! No!

02:14.175 --> 02:15.218
Help him!

02:15.760 --> 02:16.761
JUDGE: Next case!

02:17.303 --> 02:18.638
(GRUNTS)

02:19.430 --> 02:21.099
SYLVIE: Because I'm not supposed to exist.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.102
I was just a child.

02:25.019 --> 02:28.189
You were just a child
but you nearly took down the organization

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
that claims to govern the order of time.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.901
You did it on your own.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.237
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!

02:34.320 --> 02:36.573
-What's so funny?
-(CHUCKLING) You like her.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.409
-What?
-You like her. Does she like you?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.244
I don't know how to do this.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.787
I don't even know what we're doing.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.291
How do I know that, in the final moments,
you won't betray me?

02:46.791 --> 02:47.959
I won't let you down.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.043
You sure?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.420
'Cause if we make it,

02:51.713 --> 02:53.882
there might be a timeline for you to rule.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.555
LOKI: Am I dead?

03:00.638 --> 03:01.639
(GASPS)

03:01.723 --> 03:03.183
VOICE: Not yet.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.977
KID LOKI: This is the place
where the TVA dumps its rubbish,

03:07.478 --> 03:08.563
everything they prune.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.273
WOMAN: A void at the end of time.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.609
Hello, which one of us are you?

03:12.692 --> 03:16.321
And now I'm surrounded
by Variants of myself, plus an alligator,

03:16.404 --> 03:19.449
which I'm heart-broken to report
I didn't even find all that strange.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.367
He's overly sensitive like the rest of us.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.535
So what's the next move?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.454
SYLVIE: The TVA needs to be brought down.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.165
We don't know who created it
or where they are,

03:27.248 --> 03:28.917
but that thing out there does.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.586
Glorious purpose!

03:33.213 --> 03:35.798
I think we're stronger than we realize.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.968
SYLVIE: If I can get close enough to it,
I can enchant it,

03:40.470 --> 03:43.139
and it's gonna take me
to whoever's behind all of this.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.809
MISS MINUTES:
Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.271
Y'all had an awfully long journey
to get here.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.981
He's impressed.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.483
Who's impressed?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.652
MISS MINUTES: He Who Remains.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.986
Come on in.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.655
You came to kill the devil.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.323
(GRUNTS)

04:00.531 --> 04:02.283
But I keep you safe.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.785
Then what are you so afraid of?

04:04.410 --> 04:05.870
My variants.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.415
Eons ago, a variant of myself

04:09.499 --> 04:13.211
discovered that there were universes
stacked on top of his own.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.587
MALE VOICE: The multiverse.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.631
HE WHO REMAINS: At the same time,
other versions of us

04:16.714 --> 04:17.924
were learning the same thing.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.968
-To some of us...
-MAN: I am Kang!

04:20.051 --> 04:24.055
...new worlds meant only
new lands to be conquered.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.726
My variants played
with time like children.

04:29.060 --> 04:33.773
I saw their chaos
spreading across realities,

04:34.065 --> 04:35.316
endless incursions.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.985
So I took control.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.697
The peace between realities

04:41.072 --> 04:44.033
erupted into all-out war.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.328
This was almost the end
of everything and everyone.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.331
However...

04:52.834 --> 04:55.003
Once I isolated our timeline,

04:55.086 --> 04:57.672
all I had to do
was prevent any further branches.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.924
Hence, the TVA.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.428
But now you kill me and destroy all this,

05:03.511 --> 05:04.971
so you don't just have one devil,

05:05.054 --> 05:07.307
you have an infinite amount. Or...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.435
You two run the thing.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.521
Return to the TVA
as its benevolent rulers.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.401
Sylvie, stop.
What if he's telling the truth?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.403
What, that a bazillion boogeymen
will turn up

05:20.486 --> 05:22.030
just because we give people free will?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.948
Remove the dictator
and what fills the void?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.241
Ah.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.368
You want the throne?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.412
Really? That's what you think of me...

05:29.495 --> 05:31.831
Better hurry.
Timeline's already branching.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.666
LOKI: I don't want a throne.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.418
I just want you to be okay.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.431
But I'm not you.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.392
(GRUNTS)

05:51.476 --> 05:53.102
I'll see you soon.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.608
LOKI: We made a terrible mistake.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.026
We freed the Timeline.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.778
It's done, Mobius.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.738
-What's done?
-Someone is coming.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.824
Countless different versions
of a very dangerous person.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.826
And they're all set on war.
We need to prepare.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.079
MOBIUS: Take it easy.
You're an analyst, right?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.622
-What division are you from?
-What?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.457
-What are you talking about?
-Who are you?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.709
HUNTER B-15:
Boots on the ground now. Archives.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.836
MOBIUS: Who are you? What's your name?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.005
(LOKI BREATHING HEAVILY)
