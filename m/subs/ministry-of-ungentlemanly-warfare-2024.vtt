WEBVTT

01:47.722 --> 01:48.531
Uh, Sweden.

01:49.923 --> 01:51.999
I'm... I'm... Swedish

01:51.999 --> 01:53.769
but I speak a little English.

01:53.769 --> 01:54.836
We're coming on board.

02:02.213 --> 02:05.113
All are welcome.
All are welcome.

02:05.113 --> 02:08.284
Even the little one.
He can come too.

02:09.619 --> 02:10.754
Welcome.

02:16.089 --> 02:18.091
Why are you here?

02:18.091 --> 02:19.926
Just a little sailing holiday.

02:19.926 --> 02:21.356
A jolly boys trip.

02:21.356 --> 02:22.166
Take your hands off.

02:26.405 --> 02:27.171
Papers?

02:27.737 --> 02:28.766
Passport?

02:31.336 --> 02:33.133
Here you go.

02:38.179 --> 02:39.975
Any other people on the boat?

02:40.950 --> 02:42.142
Just the two of us.

02:44.553 --> 02:45.618
<i>Nein.</i>

02:48.589 --> 02:50.123
Come, come,
we have lots to eat...

02:50.123 --> 02:52.051
Take your dirty hands off me!

02:53.326 --> 02:54.154
Back off!

02:57.326 --> 02:58.493
And you,

02:58.595 --> 02:59.533
put your hands in the air!

03:12.277 --> 03:13.816
Ooh!

03:13.816 --> 03:15.246
You're in trouble now!

03:15.246 --> 03:17.177
You've been a naughty boy!

03:20.322 --> 03:22.449
I'll give you 100 francs
to shoot him.

03:22.449 --> 03:23.517
Don't shoot me!

03:25.459 --> 03:28.690
He hates Germans.
You should really shoot him.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.264
I... I'm sorry.
You are very scary.

03:32.264 --> 03:33.701
Make him walk the plank.

03:33.804 --> 03:35.035
He loves wood.

03:39.173 --> 03:41.377
Dirty drunken animal!

03:43.077 --> 03:44.339
Guilty as charged.

03:59.088 --> 04:00.853
I always take
a can of kerosene

04:00.853 --> 04:02.464
for just
these sort of occasions.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.531
It's been a while,

04:06.531 --> 04:08.530
but the last time
someone laughed at me

04:08.530 --> 04:10.102
when I boarded their vessel,

04:10.204 --> 04:11.972
I gave them the choice.

04:12.074 --> 04:13.869
Either swim to shore

04:13.869 --> 04:16.536
or take their chances
on a burning ship.

04:18.042 --> 04:21.983
Hans and I wondered
which option they'd choose,

04:22.085 --> 04:24.882
death by water or death by fire.

04:26.451 --> 04:27.456
Oddly, they chose both.

04:35.697 --> 04:37.230
They waited
until the very last moment,

04:37.230 --> 04:38.731
until their hair was on fire,

04:40.636 --> 04:43.932
and their blistered skin
peeled from their fingers,

04:43.932 --> 04:46.533
before they immersed
themselves in water

04:46.533 --> 04:47.941
in the vain hope

04:48.043 --> 04:49.346
of reaching shore.

04:50.715 --> 04:51.843
One of them

04:52.874 --> 04:54.909
sank immediately and perished.

04:54.909 --> 04:57.277
But to our amazement,
the big one,

04:58.780 --> 04:59.686
he showed great spirit.

05:01.322 --> 05:02.757
<i>In spite of all the odds...</i>

05:04.293 --> 05:06.193
<i>...he painstakingly
made it to shore.</i>

05:06.193 --> 05:08.561
We followed and cheered him on

05:08.561 --> 05:11.159
and rewarded
this impressive achievement

05:12.331 --> 05:13.293
with a bullet

05:14.499 --> 05:16.472
to the back of his head.

05:19.404 --> 05:20.300
Isn't that funny?

05:21.913 --> 05:22.676
Why aren't you laughing?

06:11.126 --> 06:12.594
Nice work, Lassen.

06:14.463 --> 06:15.762
There's more
where that came from.

06:16.734 --> 06:17.533
Yes.

06:24.366 --> 06:25.365
Ah...

06:27.210 --> 06:28.368
Not sure it's working, Lassen.

06:29.577 --> 06:31.371
The captain
looks rather agitated.

06:36.650 --> 06:38.645
They're bringing their guns
to bear.

06:43.019 --> 06:44.917
They'll find their range
soon, sir.

06:45.019 --> 06:47.293
Freddy, should we be worried?

06:47.293 --> 06:48.961
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

06:49.063 --> 06:51.697
It's a rather large explosive,
so I set a rather large fuse.

06:51.697 --> 06:53.936
I located the outside
of the powder room,

06:54.038 --> 06:55.070
so when it goes bang,

06:55.172 --> 06:56.299
it really should go bang.

06:59.236 --> 07:00.637
Closer...

07:00.637 --> 07:01.973
Should be any second now, chaps.

07:07.609 --> 07:08.841
Freddy?

07:14.124 --> 07:15.415
Good work, Frederick.

07:16.192 --> 07:17.752
Thank you, Captain.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.886
Now, any chance you can tell us

07:18.886 --> 07:19.960
what we're doing here, sir?

07:30.136 --> 07:32.170
<i>The war in Europe rages on</i>

07:32.170 --> 07:35.606
<i>as Hitler and his Nazi horde
sweep aside all in their path.</i>

07:35.606 --> 07:38.272
<i>Poland, Belgium and now France</i>

07:38.272 --> 07:41.516
<i>have all fallen
to Hitler's fascist regime,</i>

07:41.516 --> 07:43.616
<i>leaving Britain
holding up the final hopes</i>

07:43.616 --> 07:45.884
<i>of liberation
for all of Europe.</i>

07:45.884 --> 07:48.421
<i>So, come on, Blighty,
get ready for a fighty.</i>

07:48.421 --> 07:50.426
<i>But we cannot do it alone.</i>

07:50.426 --> 07:52.526
<i>And any hope
for our American brothers</i>

07:52.526 --> 07:54.458
<i>to join us
from across the Atlantic</i>

07:54.458 --> 07:56.025
<i>remains frustrated</i>

07:56.025 --> 07:59.234
<i>by Germany's secret weapon,
the U-boat.</i>

07:59.234 --> 08:01.700
<i>These deadly little submarines</i>

08:01.700 --> 08:03.563
<i>hunt at will
in the North Atlantic.</i>

08:03.563 --> 08:07.300
<i>Undetectable, the U-boat
sinks ships indiscriminately,</i>

08:07.300 --> 08:10.079
<i>whether carrying
munitions, provisions</i>

08:10.079 --> 08:11.711
<i>or civilians heading</i>

08:11.711 --> 08:13.911
<i>from our companions
across the pond.</i>

08:13.911 --> 08:16.646
<i>So long as the U-boats
rule the Atlantic,</i>

08:16.646 --> 08:18.115
<i>it remains impossible</i>

08:18.115 --> 08:20.986
<i>for America's brave troops
to reach our shores.</i>

08:20.986 --> 08:24.284
<i>Will Britain be forced
to appease Hitler's plans</i>

08:24.284 --> 08:27.396
<i>or face devastation
from his offensive?</i>

08:27.396 --> 08:29.895
<i>London burns
and her seas run red,</i>

08:29.895 --> 08:32.926
<i>as bombs from above
and torpedoes from below</i>

08:32.926 --> 08:34.494
<i>grind the Brits down.</i>

08:34.494 --> 08:37.305
<i>And with no defense
against these lethal U-boats,</i>

08:37.305 --> 08:39.471
<i>it appears all hope may be lost</i>

08:39.471 --> 08:41.211
<i>for peace in Europe.</i>

08:44.011 --> 08:46.506
The Germans cut off
our supply chain with U-boats,

08:48.178 --> 08:50.411
we cut off the supply chain
to the U-boats.

08:51.981 --> 08:53.219
Through our intelligence agents,

08:53.321 --> 08:54.653
we've found a way.

08:59.722 --> 09:01.595
<i>The entire</i>

09:01.595 --> 09:04.929
<i>servicing, repairing,
and rearming</i>

09:04.929 --> 09:07.800
<i>of Hitler's
Atlantic U-boat fleet...</i>

09:07.800 --> 09:10.638
<i>is operated
by two Nazi tug boats...</i>

09:10.638 --> 09:13.709
<i>and an Italian supply ship
in Fernando Po.</i>

09:13.811 --> 09:18.678
I need men who are willing
to go and sink those ships.

09:18.678 --> 09:20.874
Why don't we just
air-raid Fernando Po

09:20.976 --> 09:22.049
and sink the ships?

09:23.783 --> 09:28.317
Because crafty Germans,
being crafty Germans,

09:28.317 --> 09:30.789
<i>have positioned themselves
in a Spanish colony.</i>

09:30.789 --> 09:33.361
<i>Fernando Po
is neutral territory.</i>

09:33.361 --> 09:35.357
<i>If we attack that colony,</i>

09:35.357 --> 09:37.895
<i>the rest of unoccupied Europe
will join the Nazis,</i>

09:37.895 --> 09:39.168
<i>and it's only
a question of time</i>

09:39.168 --> 09:40.235
<i>before we find ourselves</i>

09:40.235 --> 09:41.699
<i>frying big pink sausages</i>

09:41.699 --> 09:42.804
wearing nothing but lederhosen.

09:44.772 --> 09:46.775
Hitler is not
playing by the rules

09:47.607 --> 09:48.568
and neither are we.

09:49.876 --> 09:52.315
This will of course be
an unsanctioned,

09:52.417 --> 09:53.980
unauthorized
and unofficial mission.

09:56.212 --> 09:57.912
If they're captured
by the British,

09:58.014 --> 09:58.952
they'll be thrown in jail.

10:00.885 --> 10:01.988
But if the Nazis find them...

10:04.888 --> 10:06.058
it's torture and death.

10:07.595 --> 10:08.989
<i>Somewhat contentiously,</i>

10:08.989 --> 10:10.860
<i>I may have just the man,</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:12.692
<i>but rather inconveniently,</i>

10:12.692 --> 10:15.265
<i>he's currently incarcerated
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

10:16.440 --> 10:17.597
<i>We may not like his attitude,</i>

10:18.441 --> 10:20.600
but he's bold, he's a killer,

10:22.811 --> 10:24.175
and the men
will follow him anywhere.

10:25.481 --> 10:27.475
Are we sure this is a good idea?

10:29.484 --> 10:31.043
Of course we're not.

10:31.043 --> 10:32.249
But we're desperate.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.223
- Send him in.

10:35.223 --> 10:36.691
Forward!

10:39.825 --> 10:40.862
Stand there, Major.

10:54.642 --> 10:55.635
Thank you, Sergeant.

11:00.482 --> 11:01.712
Gus March-Phillips,

11:01.814 --> 11:02.878
this is Lieutenant Commander...

11:02.878 --> 11:05.344
Fleming. Ian Fleming.

11:05.446 --> 11:06.782
He used to be
at Naval Intelligence,

11:06.782 --> 11:07.724
now he works for me.

11:11.162 --> 11:12.759
Why am I here, M?

11:12.759 --> 11:15.363
I have a mission
I want you to lead.

11:15.465 --> 11:18.501
Why are you asking me, M?

11:18.501 --> 11:19.703
Help yourself
to a cup of tea, Major.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.852
We both know that I'm...

11:38.952 --> 11:42.855
not very popular
with the administration.

11:42.957 --> 11:45.220
The reason
they find you unattractive

11:45.322 --> 11:47.995
is the very reason
I find you attractive.

11:49.462 --> 11:50.497
Mission?

11:50.497 --> 11:52.159
Operation Postmaster.

11:52.159 --> 11:53.598
To neutralize the German U-boats

11:53.700 --> 11:54.694
in the North Atlantic.

11:59.335 --> 12:02.377
- And, uh, what's the plan?

12:02.377 --> 12:04.171
The U-boats need

12:04.171 --> 12:05.774
- fuel and torpedoes.
- Oh.

12:05.876 --> 12:06.945
But they also need

12:06.945 --> 12:09.544
carbon dioxide filters
for oxygen.

12:09.544 --> 12:11.282
Without them, they can't dive
and they can't hunt.

12:12.822 --> 12:14.384
Stuck on the surface,
they're obsolete.

12:18.887 --> 12:20.527
Target?

12:20.527 --> 12:22.392
The <i>Duchessa d'Aosta.</i>

12:22.392 --> 12:24.531
She's an Italian ship
the Germans have been using...

12:30.969 --> 12:33.267
...to refuel,
re-arm and replenish

12:33.369 --> 12:36.041
the CO2 filters
for the entire fleet.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.746
She's hidden
off the coast of West Africa.

12:38.746 --> 12:41.384
A small island
called Fernando Po.

12:41.384 --> 12:44.816
We want you to, um, sink her.

12:44.816 --> 12:46.587
You'll be posing as fishermen

12:46.587 --> 12:48.021
sailing down the west coast

12:48.021 --> 12:49.721
on board a trawler
loaded with enough explosives

12:49.721 --> 12:51.824
to destroy the <i>Duchessa.</i>

12:51.824 --> 12:54.224
This is Agents
Heron and Stewart.

12:54.224 --> 12:57.028
They'll be working
undercover on the island.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.599
Mr. Heron's
already established there,

12:58.599 --> 13:00.465
running various businesses.

13:00.568 --> 13:02.034
What businesses?

13:02.034 --> 13:05.468
A casino bar,
and illegal exports game.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.907
Profitable?

13:07.907 --> 13:09.845
- I do quite well.

13:09.845 --> 13:12.409
High-ranking Nazis
are my most valued clients.

13:12.976 --> 13:13.773
Good for you.

13:17.578 --> 13:19.513
Miss Stewart,
an actress and singer,

13:19.616 --> 13:21.421
has been training with us
for the last two years.

13:21.421 --> 13:22.623
She'll be posing

13:22.623 --> 13:24.285
as a gold trader from New York.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.124
Her mission is
to seduce and distract

13:26.226 --> 13:28.125
the island's Commanding
Officer Heinrich Luhr.

13:28.227 --> 13:30.999
She's very capable
and somewhat motivated.

13:31.996 --> 13:33.865
Motivated how, sir?

13:33.968 --> 13:35.872
My mother's side
were German Jews.

13:37.607 --> 13:39.034
They were the first to go.

13:39.034 --> 13:40.442
Very sorry to hear that.

13:40.442 --> 13:41.937
I'm sure you'll recover.

13:41.937 --> 13:43.711
We have 44 days

13:43.813 --> 13:45.678
before the Nazis
move their operation.

13:45.780 --> 13:46.806
We won't find them again.

13:50.513 --> 13:53.447
If I'm to do this,
I'll need my own team.

13:53.447 --> 13:55.617
You won't like them.
They're all, uh...

13:58.261 --> 14:00.092
mad.

14:00.092 --> 14:02.822
They'll need to be.
Give us their names.

14:06.699 --> 14:08.068
Henry Hayes.

14:08.068 --> 14:11.606
<i>A smart, young Irishman
who hates the Nazis</i>

14:11.606 --> 14:13.003
<i>because his older brother,</i>

14:13.003 --> 14:15.274
<i>who was a close friend of mine,</i>

14:15.274 --> 14:18.077
<i>drowned after a U-boat
sank his fishing trawler.</i>

14:18.077 --> 14:21.077
<i>I've taken him under my wing
ever since.</i>

14:21.077 --> 14:23.143
He's cunning, quiet and wily.

14:23.143 --> 14:24.512
More to the point,

14:24.512 --> 14:27.352
Hayes is a magnificent sailor
and I trust him.

14:28.893 --> 14:31.287
If we're going
to try and sink a large ship,

14:31.287 --> 14:34.460
we'll need
Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.497
<i>He can swim across the channel
with his feet tied together.</i>

14:37.497 --> 14:39.298
<i>Admittedly,</i>

14:39.298 --> 14:41.033
<i>he's a convicted arsonist
and a terrible misery</i>

14:41.033 --> 14:43.102
<i>unless he's destroying something.</i>

14:43.102 --> 14:45.502
But he's very good
at blowing things up.

14:46.975 --> 14:49.341
Next, we'll need
the Danish hammer.

14:50.513 --> 14:52.514
Anders Lassen.

14:52.514 --> 14:53.783
<i>Grew up wrestling bears</i>

14:53.783 --> 14:55.516
<i>and hunting elk
on his family estate.</i>

14:55.516 --> 14:56.786
<i>He's a legend</i>

14:56.786 --> 14:58.853
<i>with a Bowie knife
and a bow and arrow.</i>

14:58.853 --> 15:01.188
<i>He ran away at 18
to fight the Nazis</i>

15:01.188 --> 15:03.684
<i>after the Gestapo tortured
his brother to death.</i>

15:03.684 --> 15:06.759
<i>He gave up filleting game
for gutting Nazis.</i>

15:06.861 --> 15:08.629
He then turned up on our shores

15:08.731 --> 15:10.192
ready to fight alongside us.

15:10.192 --> 15:12.525
He is an uncontrollable mad dog

15:12.525 --> 15:14.501
who knows
a hundred creative ways

15:14.501 --> 15:15.598
to kill a man.

15:16.703 --> 15:18.403
And finally,

15:18.403 --> 15:21.406
and most importantly,
we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.414
Yes, we thought you might.

15:25.516 --> 15:27.312
That's why we sent him

15:27.312 --> 15:28.746
<i>on a reconnaissance mission
to Fernando Po.</i>

15:28.746 --> 15:29.817
Unfortunately,

15:29.919 --> 15:31.350
the Nazis nabbed him
on his return.

15:31.350 --> 15:34.551
All the more reason.
He knows what we need to know.

15:35.592 --> 15:36.990
He's a master planner,

15:37.092 --> 15:40.628
a master survivor,
a chess grand master

15:40.730 --> 15:42.097
and a surgeon with the blade.

15:44.926 --> 15:48.765
<i>We spent two weeks together
in a Dunkirk foxhole</i>

15:48.765 --> 15:51.931
<i>and if it wasn't for Apple,
I would still be there today.</i>

15:53.808 --> 15:54.934
No Apple, no mission.

15:55.811 --> 15:57.179
I'm afraid that's impossible.

15:57.179 --> 15:58.207
Why?

15:58.207 --> 16:00.344
<i>Because he's being held</i>

16:00.344 --> 16:03.011
<i>by an entire German garrison
on La Palma.</i>

16:05.952 --> 16:07.488
La Palma's on the way.

16:08.950 --> 16:10.851
- That's insanity.
- You let me worry about that.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.857
I must get me
one of those coats.

16:44.794 --> 16:45.826
Now, any chance you can tell us

16:45.826 --> 16:47.127
what we're doing here, sir?

16:47.127 --> 16:49.293
Dry yourself off, frogman,
and I'll tell you.

16:49.293 --> 16:51.364
The curiosity is
eating us all up, sir.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.667
<i>I apologize
for all the secrecy, chaps.</i>

16:58.475 --> 17:00.175
But this is

17:00.277 --> 17:05.537
an unsanctioned, unofficial
and unauthorized mission.

17:05.639 --> 17:07.307
If we're picked up by the Brits,

17:07.307 --> 17:08.183
we will all go to jail.

17:10.217 --> 17:11.882
If we're picked up
by the Germans,

17:11.984 --> 17:13.012
torture and death.

17:15.123 --> 17:16.349
So, it's just
the four of us then?

17:16.451 --> 17:18.719
And Captain Appleyard.

17:18.821 --> 17:21.655
He's responsible
for securing this information.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.934
He is, however,
in a spot of bother.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.770
He is being held
by the Germans on La Palma.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.300
Our first job
is to liberate him.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.940
- Oh, so, that's all, is it?
-No.

17:31.042 --> 17:33.007
We need to confirm
Appleyard's intelligence.

17:33.007 --> 17:34.736
That's why
there are two more agents

17:34.838 --> 17:37.304
on their way to Fernando Po
by train, as we speak.

17:37.304 --> 17:39.108
Doing what, exactly?

17:39.108 --> 17:40.245
They'll be ensuring

17:40.347 --> 17:42.380
that those ships
are filled with supplies,

17:42.483 --> 17:44.450
so they're worth blowing up
in the first place.

17:49.489 --> 17:52.390
It's one thing
taking over the world,

17:52.492 --> 17:54.053
but do they have to
take over the kitchen too?

17:55.494 --> 17:58.966
It's all sausage,
cabbage and black bread.

17:59.068 --> 18:00.796
Who would
you have preferred?

18:00.898 --> 18:04.632
The French offer
the refined classical take.

18:04.632 --> 18:08.208
<i>Cote de boeuf,
fromage, le beurre...</i>

18:08.208 --> 18:10.542
<i>- ca suffit!</i>

18:10.542 --> 18:13.072
What about the rustic
spontaneity of the Italians?

18:14.777 --> 18:19.220
Their oils, the linguine,
the tomatoes.

18:19.220 --> 18:21.722
I'd climb over the linguine
to get to the fettucine.

18:21.722 --> 18:23.921
But the cinghiale.

18:23.921 --> 18:24.985
Mmm.

18:26.093 --> 18:27.790
You have me with the wild boar.

18:29.065 --> 18:31.698
But then again,
the Spanish offer

18:31.698 --> 18:32.999
the smorgasbord

18:33.102 --> 18:36.365
of the regional paella
and tapas.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.570
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.735
So?

18:41.735 --> 18:44.108
We're between
a rock and a hard place.

18:44.108 --> 18:45.637
If the Brits win the war,

18:45.739 --> 18:47.106
we're stuck with fish and chips.

18:48.115 --> 18:49.152
If the Germans win the war,

18:50.920 --> 18:52.320
we're stuck with this menu.

18:53.490 --> 18:54.520
So?

18:56.323 --> 18:58.752
We'll have the sausage,
the cabbage

18:58.752 --> 18:59.954
- and the black bread please.

19:01.325 --> 19:02.121
<i>Tres bien. Merci.</i>

19:19.815 --> 19:20.612
Our situation?

19:21.617 --> 19:22.977
Steady.

19:32.595 --> 19:33.724
Steady.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.161
Now.

19:54.982 --> 19:56.010
Mmm.

20:03.025 --> 20:04.021
I'm exhausted.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.414
<i>Entschuldigung, bitte.</i>

20:35.090 --> 20:36.121
Halt!

20:52.338 --> 20:53.276
Is there a problem?

21:04.519 --> 21:05.948
I can manage
myself, thank you.

21:09.322 --> 21:10.790
Allow me, Miss Stewart.

21:25.370 --> 21:26.265
Allow me.

21:26.908 --> 21:27.942
Thank you.

21:30.470 --> 21:31.605
<i>Prost!</i>

21:47.764 --> 21:48.793
Door.

21:49.963 --> 21:50.993
Locked.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.367
Case?

21:59.367 --> 22:00.642
Working on it.

22:25.936 --> 22:26.897
Sir, contact.

22:29.172 --> 22:30.329
- Contact.

22:30.972 --> 22:32.133
Standing by.

22:37.413 --> 22:39.412
<i>Duchessa's</i> manifest. Ready?

22:39.412 --> 22:41.674
- Ready.
- 400 B-grade torpedoes. Check.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.413
400 B-grade torpedoes.

22:46.413 --> 22:47.655
Check.

22:47.655 --> 22:48.784
Check.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.615
5,000 tons of diesel. Check.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.262
5,000 tons of diesel.

22:56.365 --> 22:57.160
- Lieutenant.
-Yes, sir?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.429
Check.

22:58.532 --> 23:00.102
-Check.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.169
10,000 carbon dioxide filters.
Check.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.365
End of message from Stork, sir.

23:07.009 --> 23:07.842
Confirm receipt.

23:09.670 --> 23:10.813
Receipt confirmed.

23:10.813 --> 23:12.213
Urgent, Chequers.

23:12.213 --> 23:14.641
Get the car ready.
Inform Fleming.

23:14.641 --> 23:15.583
Let's pack it up.

23:17.252 --> 23:18.448
No point robbing the bank

23:18.550 --> 23:20.120
if there's no gold in the vault.

23:27.028 --> 23:28.063
Thank you.

23:28.063 --> 23:29.364
It's truly comforting to know

23:29.364 --> 23:31.192
there's at least one gentleman
in the world.

23:32.665 --> 23:34.099
Ah!
Idiot!

23:37.403 --> 23:38.639
Good day.

23:52.354 --> 23:56.459
Sausage, cabbage
and black bread.

24:02.662 --> 24:04.361
<i>Hitler
has made us an offer.</i>

24:04.361 --> 24:05.694
<i>An appeasement.</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:07.699
<i>But we must step down our army,</i>

24:07.699 --> 24:10.830
<i>surrender our Navy
and accept Nazi rule.</i>

24:10.830 --> 24:12.771
<i>Otherwise, he promises</i>

24:12.771 --> 24:16.570
<i>total destruction of Britain
and her empire.</i>

24:16.570 --> 24:18.544
Our best option

24:18.544 --> 24:20.615
is to take Hitler's deal
while we can.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.353
The Air Marshal agrees.

24:24.353 --> 24:28.947
He has more bombs,
more men, more machines.

24:29.049 --> 24:30.986
We won't survive much longer.

24:31.088 --> 24:34.296
You have to make
the only decision you can make

24:34.296 --> 24:36.026
<i>in good conscience,
Prime Minister.</i>

24:36.026 --> 24:38.433
<i>Good God, girls.
Listen to yourselves.</i>

24:38.433 --> 24:40.931
<i>It's not appeasement,
it's surrender.</i>

24:40.931 --> 24:43.430
You still fail to realize
who we're up against.

24:43.430 --> 24:47.142
With respect, Prime Minister,
it's you who doesn't realize.

24:47.142 --> 24:48.544
We cannot hope to defeat him.

24:50.347 --> 24:53.373
Hitler is
the mainspring of evil,

24:54.182 --> 24:55.450
a guttersnipe.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.450
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with.

24:57.450 --> 24:59.388
I've read his book,
Admiral Pound.

24:59.490 --> 25:02.353
The man is a vicious,
victimized ideologue.

25:02.455 --> 25:03.482
He cannot be trusted.

25:06.321 --> 25:07.193
If I thought that
we could've achieved peace

25:07.295 --> 25:08.327
through surrendering,

25:08.327 --> 25:10.322
I'd have done it already.

25:10.322 --> 25:12.665
<i>We need to stop our country
from starving.</i>

25:12.665 --> 25:14.930
<i>We need
three million tons of supplies</i>

25:14.930 --> 25:17.463
to cross the Atlantic
every month.

25:17.463 --> 25:19.833
We are currently losing
50% of that to U-boat attacks.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.575
Another reason to take the deal.

25:22.575 --> 25:24.811
I've not finished,
Algernon, darling.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.075
<i>We need the Americans,</i>

25:28.075 --> 25:29.847
<i>and they will
never enter the war</i>

25:29.847 --> 25:31.813
<i>if we already appear
to be a losing side.</i>

25:31.813 --> 25:34.355
Ending hostilities with Germany

25:34.355 --> 25:36.423
is the best path
out of this mess.

25:36.525 --> 25:39.386
We are all in agreement,
Prime Minister.

25:40.559 --> 25:41.520
Thank you, gentlemen.

25:46.029 --> 25:47.202
Yes,
thank you, gentlemen!

25:53.433 --> 25:55.241
<i>M, Fleming,
this better be good news.</i>

25:55.241 --> 25:56.343
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

25:56.343 --> 25:58.212
<i>we have the manifest here, sir.</i>

25:58.212 --> 25:59.779
<i>It's been confirmed</i>

25:59.779 --> 26:01.516
<i>the</i> Duchessa
<i>is fully laden with supplies</i>

26:01.516 --> 26:03.880
to keep the U-boats
operational indefinitely.

26:03.982 --> 26:07.616
If we're going to sink her,
now is the time.

26:07.718 --> 26:09.020
They're on their way.

26:10.357 --> 26:11.556
And their chances?

26:11.556 --> 26:14.553
Well, if anyone can, they can.

26:19.169 --> 26:20.831
But if we're discovered,

26:20.831 --> 26:22.803
parliament will remove you
from office.

26:24.765 --> 26:26.937
Well,

26:27.040 --> 26:28.803
we'd better make sure
we're not discovered then.

26:32.273 --> 26:33.380
We'll take it
from the cliffside.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.710
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

26:35.710 --> 26:36.846
No one should notice

26:36.846 --> 26:39.018
a small, innocuous
fishing vessel.

26:39.018 --> 26:41.453
We'll set up in the woods
and see what we're up against,

26:41.555 --> 26:43.557
then we'll go for a night raid.

26:43.557 --> 26:46.255
Slip in quietly,
find Apple, come out fast.

26:46.864 --> 26:48.123
Numbers?

26:48.225 --> 26:50.589
Intelligence suggests
a garrison of 50 to 60.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.868
That should be about 15 each.

26:53.868 --> 26:57.436
Lassen, try not to be greedy.
You do have a reputation.

26:57.436 --> 26:59.904
My killing days are over.

26:59.904 --> 27:02.141
I'm just here
as a peacekeeping observer.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.906
Freddy, bag the kit,
silence the weapons.

27:51.492 --> 27:52.917
When do we go?

27:52.917 --> 27:54.763
0200.

27:54.763 --> 27:57.489
Take the towers first,
then move onto the radio room,

27:57.489 --> 27:59.658
barracks and end up
in the control room...

28:01.772 --> 28:03.464
- What do we have here?

28:04.172 --> 28:05.469
Gestapo.

28:05.469 --> 28:07.204
How'd you know?

28:07.306 --> 28:10.204
The badder they are,
the better they're dressed.

28:10.306 --> 28:12.379
I really must get me
one of those coats.

28:12.481 --> 28:13.980
They must be here for Apple.

28:15.476 --> 28:18.182
It's either torture
or, uh, extraction, sir.

28:18.182 --> 28:20.487
If they extract him,
it'll be the end of Apple.

28:20.487 --> 28:21.680
We won't be seeing him again.

28:22.721 --> 28:23.988
I'm afraid, gentlemen,

28:23.988 --> 28:25.658
we're not going
to have the luxury of night.

28:25.658 --> 28:26.987
We're going
to have to go in now.

28:40.039 --> 28:41.207
So,
what's happened there then?

28:41.310 --> 28:42.534
It looks like

28:42.534 --> 28:43.608
they've been plugged
full of arrows, Haysey.

28:43.710 --> 28:44.703
Well, where did the arrows go?

28:45.976 --> 28:46.782
Straight through them.

28:50.619 --> 28:53.221
There were
two more round the other side.

28:53.323 --> 28:54.420
Where are they now?

28:54.522 --> 28:56.355
Same place as these two.

28:56.355 --> 28:57.823
Nazi heaven.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.458
Well, we've got
less than seven minutes

28:59.560 --> 29:00.790
before they're missed.

29:00.892 --> 29:03.021
Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

29:04.157 --> 29:05.732
Go undercover of the engine.

29:05.732 --> 29:07.561
Only break cover
when things go bang.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.574
I have a great idea, Lassen.

29:12.574 --> 29:14.234
Why don't you march off
by yourself

29:14.336 --> 29:15.805
and fill those Germans
full of arrows?

29:26.452 --> 29:28.584
Freddy, grab the scissors
and help him with that fence.

29:28.584 --> 29:29.654
Aye, sir.

29:49.976 --> 29:51.578
Haysey, you're with me.
We go left.

29:51.578 --> 29:54.408
Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

29:54.408 --> 29:56.117
Fill your boots, gentlemen,
and bon appetit.

30:00.151 --> 30:01.756
- See you at the tower.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.452
And remember, gentlemen,
try to have fun.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.997
-  So far, so good.

30:45.099 --> 30:46.697
- Doing rather well, Haysey.

30:46.799 --> 30:47.897
Oh, why thank you, sir.

31:05.687 --> 31:06.986
It's very good.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.020
Sounds like
stealth mode's over.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.095
Haysey, down!

32:54.928 --> 32:56.262
<i>- Nein! Nein!</i>

33:29.096 --> 33:29.856
Do we know each other?

33:30.799 --> 33:32.562
- No.

33:49.212 --> 33:51.311
Is that a heart, Lassen?

33:51.311 --> 33:52.816
For the avoidance of doubt.

33:52.816 --> 33:55.120
Apple, old boy.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.652
- Gus.
-I see you two have met.

33:57.692 --> 33:59.356
This is Haysey.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.926
-Pleasure, Haysey.
- Pleasure's mine.

34:02.028 --> 34:03.230
I thought you might need these.

34:04.227 --> 34:06.095
Jolly thoughtful of you.

34:06.197 --> 34:07.025
You all find him?

34:08.702 --> 34:09.863
Oh, goody.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.108
Bloody hell,
what happened to your nipples?

34:17.811 --> 34:19.873
You all right?

34:19.873 --> 34:22.282
Couldn't unplug me, could you?
Battery's still on.

35:40.292 --> 35:41.955
Did you see the <i>Duchessa,</i>

35:42.995 --> 35:44.756
the tug boats?

35:44.756 --> 35:47.026
And rather
a lot of Nazi soldiers.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.971
Why wasn't that in your report?

35:49.971 --> 35:54.038
Because those soldiers
and those guns,

35:54.140 --> 35:56.706
and those S-Boats are all new.

35:58.610 --> 36:01.642
That's a lot more
than the boys are expecting.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.816
A month ago,
it was a dozen mechanics.

36:03.816 --> 36:04.949
Six drunk sailors.

36:04.949 --> 36:06.281
Two fat Spaniards.

36:06.281 --> 36:07.981
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

36:10.521 --> 36:12.458
I'd say,
we're gonna need more help.

36:14.621 --> 36:16.061
You leave that to me.

36:16.061 --> 36:17.424
- Of course.

36:20.201 --> 36:21.861
-But right now...

36:21.963 --> 36:24.032
- ...you need to meet that man.

36:27.239 --> 36:29.476
Your man.
The reason you're here.

36:29.476 --> 36:31.308
Ah.

36:31.308 --> 36:33.380
The only thing
worse than a Nazi...

36:34.715 --> 36:35.745
is him.

37:03.542 --> 37:05.442
I'm very disappointed, Heron.

37:05.442 --> 37:07.740
There are 16 crates
in my warehouse

37:07.842 --> 37:10.346
you have not yet
shipped to the mainland.

37:10.346 --> 37:12.484
No need to fret, <i>Herr</i> Luhr.

37:12.484 --> 37:13.686
They'll still be delivered
by the agreed date.

37:13.686 --> 37:15.120
That may be.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.450
But they take up valuable space.

37:17.450 --> 37:18.520
For this, I expect

37:18.520 --> 37:20.691
a significant reduction
in your fee.

37:22.329 --> 37:23.898
-I can do 5%...

37:23.898 --> 37:25.530
...as a gesture of goodwill.

37:25.530 --> 37:29.069
Twenty. And don't waste
my precious time haggling.

37:29.069 --> 37:30.134
Well,
strictly speaking,

37:30.236 --> 37:31.601
there should be no reductions,

37:31.704 --> 37:34.540
since there's not yet been
any breach of contract.

37:34.540 --> 37:38.236
Five is more than polite,
20 rings like a sour note,

37:38.911 --> 37:40.040
it jars.

37:40.616 --> 37:42.544
It jars?

37:42.544 --> 37:45.251
Am I being
accused of disharmony?

37:45.251 --> 37:47.454
I take that
as a personal affront.

37:50.689 --> 37:54.086
And I am supposing
you are not the secretary.

37:54.086 --> 37:57.162
Miss Stewart is the contact
I said I'd arrange.

37:57.162 --> 37:59.631
Ah, your New York gold contact?

38:00.901 --> 38:01.960
I told you,

38:02.062 --> 38:04.262
I already have
a satisfying arrangement.

38:05.037 --> 38:06.068
Have a seat.

38:06.068 --> 38:07.336
Thank you.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.272
Well,
I hope I don't disappoint.

38:17.551 --> 38:19.519
I can't make a decision
on this presentation.

38:20.250 --> 38:21.551
Early days.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.586
Well, if early days
do come too soon,

38:23.586 --> 38:25.525
and seasons change
with a Hunter's Moon.

38:33.570 --> 38:34.336
Hmm.

38:35.099 --> 38:37.038
Hmm.

38:37.140 --> 38:37.937
I have to say, Heron,

38:37.937 --> 38:39.637
for all your flaws,

38:39.739 --> 38:41.706
you do have a habit
of pulling rabbits from hats.

38:46.411 --> 38:49.314
So, how much gold
do you wish to move,

38:49.314 --> 38:50.352
- Miss Stewart?

38:52.812 --> 38:54.884
As much as you can find.

39:00.028 --> 39:02.396
As I mentioned before,

39:02.396 --> 39:05.394
I do already have
a very profitable arrangement.

39:05.496 --> 39:07.960
And despite of your commentary,

39:07.960 --> 39:10.405
I pride myself
on maintaining harmony.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.376
Now, why should I entertain you?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.604
Because you'll make more money
and have lots of fun

39:19.604 --> 39:20.580
whilst doing so.

39:22.483 --> 39:25.816
If I'm not good for my word,
don't pay me.

39:42.001 --> 39:42.833
Bravo.

39:44.672 --> 39:47.266
I will talk to my people
and then we'll rendezvous.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.070
Lovely.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.280
When the sly red cat
barks at dawn,

39:55.280 --> 39:57.284
and kills just for her pleasure,

39:57.386 --> 40:00.219
who shares the meal
the cat did steal

40:00.219 --> 40:01.588
when both looked on in pleasure?

40:04.487 --> 40:05.427
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

40:52.900 --> 40:54.301
The riddle was a nice touch.

40:58.112 --> 40:59.278
The hook's in.

41:02.384 --> 41:04.145
Now be careful
how you reel him in.

41:15.526 --> 41:16.723
I'll make sure
the harbor's empty

41:16.723 --> 41:17.928
when the boys arrive.

41:19.465 --> 41:21.365
How are you going to do that?

41:21.467 --> 41:23.368
I'll throw a party at my club.

41:23.368 --> 41:26.000
A costume party for the officers

41:26.103 --> 41:27.971
and a second party at the dock
for the soldiers.

41:29.771 --> 41:30.776
People like my parties.

41:31.981 --> 41:33.141
Everyone but Luhr.

41:33.940 --> 41:35.712
That will be your job.

41:35.712 --> 41:37.519
All the rats
will follow the piper.

41:45.626 --> 41:46.391
So,
if I understand correctly,

41:46.494 --> 41:47.988
we're currently
here in La Palma.

41:48.090 --> 41:49.930
We'll sail around
German-controlled Africa

41:49.930 --> 41:50.990
to Fernando Po,

41:51.092 --> 41:52.727
which is just
north of the Equator,

41:52.727 --> 41:54.498
just off the West African coast.

41:54.498 --> 41:56.634
So that's the shortest route?

41:56.634 --> 41:58.204
Yes, but we don't
want to go shorter.

41:58.306 --> 42:00.205
Our priority is not to be seen.

42:00.307 --> 42:02.774
You mean, be seen again.

42:02.774 --> 42:05.970
Again? Getting a little sloppy
on us now, Gussy?

42:05.970 --> 42:07.346
Had a run-in already?

42:07.346 --> 42:09.078
Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

42:10.019 --> 42:11.476
Remind me again

42:11.476 --> 42:12.953
how you found your nipples
attached to a car battery.

42:14.321 --> 42:15.952
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

42:15.952 --> 42:17.654
Bad intelligence.
Plus it was almost worth it

42:17.654 --> 42:19.052
to watch
the heart-snatcher at work.

42:19.154 --> 42:21.059
I'm better known as a lover
than a fighter.

42:21.162 --> 42:22.419
Jesus Christ!

42:22.522 --> 42:23.991
If that's how you fight,
I'd hate to see you love.

42:23.991 --> 42:25.358
You don't have
to worry about that,

42:26.631 --> 42:28.663
you're too pretty for me.

42:28.663 --> 42:30.528
Freddy, on the other hand...

42:31.999 --> 42:33.531
You'd have to catch me first.

42:34.340 --> 42:35.577
I do love to hunt.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.041
You'd be lucky.

42:39.039 --> 42:40.505
I'm really getting quite hot.

42:40.505 --> 42:43.348
Anyway, my suggestion is
that we take this wider route.

42:43.348 --> 42:44.817
<i>It's obviously longer</i>

42:44.817 --> 42:45.882
<i>but it should avoid
any awkward conversations</i>

42:45.882 --> 42:48.616
<i>with German U-boats
or British warships.</i>

42:48.616 --> 42:49.786
<i>Weather-dependent,</i>

42:49.786 --> 42:51.549
<i>we should make it there
in 15 days.</i>

42:52.587 --> 42:53.824
Agreed.

42:53.824 --> 42:55.553
Haysey, do you think
you could manage that?

42:56.594 --> 42:57.625
Leave it to me, sir.

43:21.419 --> 43:23.216
Just do as you're told

43:23.216 --> 43:24.718
- and get me another drink!

43:24.718 --> 43:25.918
Captain, sir.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.325
Can I get you something to eat?

43:27.427 --> 43:28.694
May I... Come this way.

43:28.694 --> 43:29.822
- Take your hands off me.

43:32.562 --> 43:33.591
You know,

43:35.236 --> 43:36.000
I like you, Femi.

43:38.070 --> 43:41.007
But you touch me again
and you're going to jail.

43:41.007 --> 43:42.072
Femi.

43:47.381 --> 43:48.441
I'll deal with him.

43:49.616 --> 43:50.608
Please take care
of Miss Stewart.

43:53.621 --> 43:55.485
You know what you need,
Captain Binea?

43:55.587 --> 43:56.614
I know what I need.

43:57.391 --> 44:00.288
But do you, Ricardo?

44:01.791 --> 44:03.324
You need another drink.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.132
Marty,

44:07.234 --> 44:08.697
good stuff.

44:08.799 --> 44:12.097
Ricardo, that's why I love you.

44:12.097 --> 44:13.499
- You understand.

44:14.508 --> 44:15.633
This is Fernando Po.

44:16.938 --> 44:17.943
Everybody's welcome.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.276
<i>Si...</i> Everybody.

44:22.614 --> 44:24.149
Too many body I think.

44:28.155 --> 44:29.152
Armando?

44:30.758 --> 44:32.656
Have you fallen out
with our new friends?

44:32.656 --> 44:34.487
It's not fair, Ricardo.

44:35.296 --> 44:36.654
This is my harbor.

44:37.661 --> 44:39.333
I am in charge.

44:39.333 --> 44:40.928
Are they stepping on your toes?

44:40.928 --> 44:42.094
They don't step, they stamp!

44:42.094 --> 44:44.104
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

44:47.836 --> 44:49.071
Only now do I hear

44:49.071 --> 44:50.572
the <i>Duchessa</i>
is leaving the harbor early.

44:53.315 --> 44:54.309
Well, good riddance.

44:55.681 --> 44:57.081
The harbor will be yours again.

44:59.347 --> 45:01.679
When will you be free
of that ugly vessel?

45:02.357 --> 45:03.681
Three days earlier.

45:05.055 --> 45:06.684
Then we should
have another drink.

45:07.956 --> 45:09.992
To celebrate. Marty...

45:09.992 --> 45:11.931
Another round
for our Harbor Master.

45:13.627 --> 45:17.165
So, Captain, do you know
where they wish to relocate?

45:17.165 --> 45:20.533
It's neither cat nor dog
that kills for fun,

45:21.542 --> 45:23.701
it's the vixen, not another.

45:24.811 --> 45:27.246
There's only two
that kill for fun,

45:27.348 --> 45:29.548
my pretty friend,

45:29.548 --> 45:32.617
the fox and his human brother.

45:49.430 --> 45:51.729
I believe I have
resolved your little riddle.

45:53.474 --> 45:56.208
<i>Chapeau.</i> You play well.

45:59.413 --> 46:00.914
Speaking of foxes,

46:02.542 --> 46:05.743
Horowitz and Meyer,
West 47th Street.

46:06.619 --> 46:07.580
Have you heard of them?

46:08.754 --> 46:09.923
I don't believe I have, no.

46:43.987 --> 46:45.523
They're the largest gold traders

46:45.625 --> 46:47.428
in Midtown New York

46:47.428 --> 46:48.786
and you haven't heard of them?

46:49.993 --> 46:51.657
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

46:54.233 --> 46:56.329
I am familiar, of course,
with Horowitz and Haim.

46:56.431 --> 46:58.664
But they're in the west side
of the city.

47:01.409 --> 47:02.633
But then again,

47:02.633 --> 47:04.373
I'm sure you already
knew that, didn't you?

47:10.813 --> 47:11.809
I'm curious,

47:13.249 --> 47:15.384
how do you find
dealing with the Jew?

47:16.491 --> 47:18.689
Oh, dear.

47:18.791 --> 47:19.889
I've slipped from one snare

47:19.889 --> 47:21.621
only to find myself in another.

47:23.630 --> 47:24.492
How shall I put this?

47:25.468 --> 47:26.801
I fear your brilliant leader

47:26.801 --> 47:28.870
has mischaracterized
the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

47:29.703 --> 47:31.069
Their ability to not only

47:31.069 --> 47:33.737
survive 3,000 years
with a boot on their neck,

47:33.839 --> 47:37.142
but to prosper in spite of it...

47:37.142 --> 47:39.837
I suspect it inspired
satanic jealousy within him.

47:40.943 --> 47:42.081
In conclusion,

47:43.011 --> 47:44.485
it looks as though

47:44.485 --> 47:47.053
the lady doth protest too much.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.757
Is there a cherry to go
on this blasphemous cake,

47:54.859 --> 47:56.130
or have you finished?

48:00.699 --> 48:03.199
I must confess,

48:03.301 --> 48:05.731
not only do I respect
and admire the Jew...

48:08.475 --> 48:09.707
I am one.

48:31.323 --> 48:32.098
Kidding!

48:33.733 --> 48:34.892
They're greedy rats.

48:38.903 --> 48:40.037
I think this could be

48:40.037 --> 48:41.943
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

48:43.912 --> 48:46.238
Then I shall throw a party
to celebrate.

48:46.340 --> 48:48.210
I don't care for parties.

48:48.210 --> 48:51.750
Oh, spoilsport!
Everybody loves a party.

48:54.147 --> 48:55.216
The <i>Duchessa's</i> leaving

48:55.216 --> 48:57.482
three days earlier
than we thought.

48:57.482 --> 48:58.586
If we don't tell
the <i>Maid Honor,</i>

48:59.792 --> 49:00.918
they'll arrive too late.

49:11.537 --> 49:12.833
Incoming.

49:14.406 --> 49:15.240
Contact.

49:16.870 --> 49:18.936
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

49:20.244 --> 49:21.774
Tin of corned beef's
out of pantry

49:22.649 --> 49:23.613
three days early.

49:27.555 --> 49:29.021
I'll take that.

49:29.021 --> 49:30.123
It's confidential,
sir. For M only.

49:32.828 --> 49:33.791
When it comes
to make the extraction,

49:33.791 --> 49:34.856
it needs to be a very...

49:34.958 --> 49:35.953
Sir. Message, sir.

49:40.098 --> 49:43.202
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

49:45.564 --> 49:46.835
Corned beef's out of the pantry

49:46.937 --> 49:47.965
three days early.

49:48.971 --> 49:51.068
Move faster.

49:51.068 --> 49:53.443
Yes, but there's increased
U-boat sightings in the area.

49:54.008 --> 49:54.972
Sir.

50:02.188 --> 50:03.189
The mission's
still proceeding.

50:06.688 --> 50:08.727
So, there's more
soldiers on the island

50:08.829 --> 50:09.823
and the boat's leaving earlier?

50:09.823 --> 50:11.160
Yes.

50:11.262 --> 50:12.632
Well, how are
we meant to move faster?

50:12.632 --> 50:13.832
We can't move faster.

50:13.832 --> 50:15.628
We're going as fast as we can.

50:15.628 --> 50:17.665
This is a fishing boat,
it's not a speedboat.

50:18.431 --> 50:19.898
<i>Prime Minister,</i>

50:19.898 --> 50:21.773
<i>the</i> Duchessa's <i>leaving
Fernando Po in 12 days.</i>

50:21.773 --> 50:23.404
<i>On our current schedule,</i>

50:23.404 --> 50:25.002
<i>they'll arrive
three days too late.</i>

50:26.813 --> 50:28.541
Can it still be done?

50:28.541 --> 50:30.276
<i>We're still
awaiting a response</i>

50:30.276 --> 50:31.085
<i>from Major Phillips.</i>

50:33.219 --> 50:35.251
If we can't move faster,
we'll go shorter.

50:35.251 --> 50:37.287
We can get to Fernando Po
in 12 days.

50:37.287 --> 50:38.485
Hold on, you said
we couldn't go shorter.

50:38.485 --> 50:40.290
No, I said
we don't want to go shorter.

50:40.290 --> 50:43.093
He said we'll get
mowed down by a U-boat.

50:43.093 --> 50:46.462
Or worse,
picked up by the Brits.

50:46.462 --> 50:48.364
Their armada of destroyers
are crossing there.

50:48.467 --> 50:50.929
We will literally
be sailing over U-boats.

50:51.971 --> 50:54.108
Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

51:17.364 --> 51:20.299
<i>Drei, zwei, eins...</i>

51:42.520 --> 51:44.587
<i>Gentlemen,
as I speak to you now,</i>

51:45.452 --> 51:47.194
<i>London once again</i>

51:47.194 --> 51:49.922
<i>shudders beneath a Nazi
onslaught from the skies.</i>

51:50.765 --> 51:52.263
<i>And at such times,</i>

51:52.263 --> 51:55.365
<i>the hearts of men
are stirred to duty.</i>

51:55.365 --> 51:56.401
<i>But you are not such men.</i>

51:57.200 --> 51:58.500
<i>You were not chosen</i>

51:58.500 --> 52:01.674
<i>for your conspicuous honor
or high ideals.</i>

52:01.674 --> 52:02.734
<i>You were chosen</i>

52:02.734 --> 52:04.670
<i>because you are
the last resort.</i>

52:04.670 --> 52:05.870
<i>The mission
you have been given</i>

52:05.870 --> 52:09.446
<i>is of a sort
never before undertaken.</i>

52:09.446 --> 52:14.120
<i>It demands ruthless men,
who will not hesitate</i>

52:14.120 --> 52:17.823
<i>to stoop beneath
the conventions of war.</i>

52:17.925 --> 52:19.919
Men who do not keep clean hands.

52:21.630 --> 52:23.560
Men like you.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.361
<i>- And yet, who still conspire</i>

52:25.361 --> 52:27.961
<i>in their own
discordant harmony.</i>

52:27.961 --> 52:32.764
<i>Who know and yet do not care
that they may never return.</i>

52:32.764 --> 52:36.039
<i>And who press onward
not for glory,</i>

52:36.039 --> 52:38.408
<i>or for duty, or for me,</i>

52:38.408 --> 52:41.076
<i>but because you are men
who will not stop</i>

52:41.076 --> 52:42.139
<i>until it is done.</i>

52:43.312 --> 52:44.614
<i>Godspeed, gentlemen.</i>

52:54.861 --> 52:56.659
Uh... Chaps...

52:58.658 --> 53:00.157
That's a British destroyer.

53:03.837 --> 53:05.673
We should move.

53:05.775 --> 53:07.164
We can't outrun that, sir.

53:09.671 --> 53:13.170
Well, we've seen them,
they've seen us.

53:19.417 --> 53:21.085
Hold fast, <i>Maid Honor.</i>

53:21.188 --> 53:22.887
We're preparing
a boarding party.

53:22.989 --> 53:24.181
Hello, Captain!

53:25.618 --> 53:27.519
Nothing exciting here.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.522
We're just Swedish fishermen.

53:29.625 --> 53:31.188
Step forward, Jorgensen!

53:33.000 --> 53:34.332
Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

53:34.332 --> 53:35.566
Ask them where
they're heading, would you?

53:41.206 --> 53:42.101
Not you, Lassen.

53:42.203 --> 53:43.200
Uh...

53:45.675 --> 53:47.248
I want to hear March-Phillips
have a go.

53:48.044 --> 53:49.074
Ah.

53:50.982 --> 53:52.886
Fair enough.

53:52.886 --> 53:55.118
Game's up, Commander.

53:55.220 --> 53:56.690
Can't blame a girl for trying.

53:56.690 --> 53:58.115
Good effort, Major.

53:58.217 --> 54:00.289
But I'm afraid you are going
to have to come with us.

54:00.289 --> 54:02.091
May I ask under whose authority

54:02.193 --> 54:03.753
we've been waylaid?

54:03.855 --> 54:05.222
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

54:10.202 --> 54:11.231
First Lieutenant.

54:11.231 --> 54:12.302
You are pursuing

54:12.404 --> 54:15.072
an unsanctioned
criminal enterprise

54:15.072 --> 54:17.537
in international waters.

54:17.537 --> 54:19.575
You're going to cause an upset.

54:19.677 --> 54:23.147
I think we're a little
past upset, Commander.

54:23.147 --> 54:24.676
Stevens, what have you got?

54:24.676 --> 54:25.814
I had a ping, sir.

54:26.888 --> 54:28.155
The greedy little Nazi

54:28.257 --> 54:30.718
won't be satisfied
with holding most of Europe,

54:30.718 --> 54:33.322
he's after our own
green and pleasant land.

54:33.322 --> 54:34.720
Well, thank God you're here

54:34.720 --> 54:35.927
with your little
wooden battleship

54:36.029 --> 54:38.261
and your five-man army.

54:38.261 --> 54:41.166
- U-boat, bearing 273.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.327
- Sound the alarm.

54:42.429 --> 54:43.897
Come aboard.

54:43.897 --> 54:45.803
U-boat approaching.
Starboard side, sir.

54:45.906 --> 54:47.800
Battle stations!

54:47.902 --> 54:50.342
Major, if you know
what's good for you,

54:50.342 --> 54:52.905
- you'll head home.
- Very good, Commander.

54:52.905 --> 54:53.913
Haysey, get us away
from that torpedo magnet

54:53.913 --> 54:55.245
as quickly as possible.

54:55.245 --> 54:57.708
Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

54:57.708 --> 54:59.252
Freddy, on the main sail.

54:59.252 --> 55:01.545
Lassen to the bow, now.
Untie that station!

55:01.545 --> 55:02.922
Aye.

55:02.922 --> 55:05.390
Quickly now, lads!

55:05.390 --> 55:07.493
Hoist that foresail for us,
will you, boys?

55:09.162 --> 55:10.595
Main sail ready to haul!

55:15.767 --> 55:17.428
All right, Freddy,
now raise that main sail!

55:17.428 --> 55:18.766
Aye.

55:18.766 --> 55:20.171
-Report sounding.

55:20.273 --> 55:21.672
-Bearing 163.

55:30.616 --> 55:31.642
Lassen, trim the main sail

55:31.744 --> 55:33.216
and then tie it off!

55:33.318 --> 55:34.619
How do you expect good?

55:36.486 --> 55:37.581
Report sounding.

55:37.581 --> 55:39.291
Bearing 115.

55:39.291 --> 55:40.386
-Fire depth charges.

56:14.793 --> 56:17.494
So, this is your man
that gets things done?

56:17.494 --> 56:20.357
His name is Kamp Billy...
with a K.

56:23.470 --> 56:25.032
And he went
to an English boarding school?

56:26.507 --> 56:29.542
Not just any boarding school.
He went to Eton,

56:31.045 --> 56:32.369
the boarding school.

56:33.847 --> 56:34.877
Right...

56:38.812 --> 56:39.684
Then what's he doing here?

56:40.251 --> 56:41.845
He's a prince.

56:41.845 --> 56:44.290
A prince of what, exactly?

56:44.392 --> 56:47.227
- The Prince of Fernando Po!

56:47.227 --> 56:50.387
So, he's part pirate,
part aristocrat?

56:51.557 --> 56:53.463
Chic.

56:53.463 --> 56:55.392
He's also
a part of our solution.

56:57.772 --> 56:59.036
RH.

56:59.870 --> 57:00.969
KB.

57:01.668 --> 57:02.907
He's back in town.

57:03.009 --> 57:03.774
Chief.

57:12.114 --> 57:14.411
Seems like
you always come bearing gifts.

57:16.089 --> 57:17.916
Is she for me?

57:18.018 --> 57:19.416
- Good luck with that.

57:20.522 --> 57:21.418
I'm not for you,

57:22.524 --> 57:24.095
but these are.

57:24.095 --> 57:26.431
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

57:29.434 --> 57:30.427
-  Ade...
- Chief.

57:31.799 --> 57:32.864
Come on, come on.

57:36.439 --> 57:37.841
Someone has taste.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.739
Rarer than hens' teeth.

57:40.739 --> 57:45.315
Well, RH tells me that KB

57:45.417 --> 57:46.913
is the only man to talk to

57:46.913 --> 57:49.553
when it comes
to getting things done.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.291
Why do I feel like
I've gone from being

57:51.291 --> 57:53.626
- the predator to the prey?

58:00.892 --> 58:02.963
Quite an entrance, young lady.

58:03.065 --> 58:04.637
It's on the condition
that we sample them...

58:05.807 --> 58:06.837
now.

58:10.276 --> 58:11.735
Ade, set the table.

58:11.735 --> 58:12.805
Chief.

58:12.908 --> 58:15.213
And then the Duke said,

58:15.315 --> 58:16.916
"Push it in till it stops!"

58:22.586 --> 58:25.185
You are quite the weapon.

58:25.960 --> 58:26.857
I was right,

58:27.930 --> 58:29.057
I was the prey.

58:32.324 --> 58:35.767
I'll help you
because I don't like Nazis.

58:35.767 --> 58:38.801
Not because they're Nazis
but because they're gauche.

58:38.801 --> 58:40.798
I'll give you a tug
and 12 of my best men,

58:40.798 --> 58:42.334
including yours truly.

58:43.941 --> 58:46.839
But if I'm gonna help you,
who's gonna help me?

58:46.942 --> 58:48.747
Because you're
not a soldier, RH.

58:50.018 --> 58:52.311
No, but she is.

58:55.553 --> 58:57.019
She'll outshoot your best man.

59:34.193 --> 59:34.958
I told you.

59:38.758 --> 59:40.298
- No!
- No!

59:42.567 --> 59:43.967
Stork delivery. Check.

59:45.038 --> 59:46.304
Check.

59:46.406 --> 59:47.971
Twenty-three boys. Check.

59:49.235 --> 59:50.644
- Stork delivery.

59:53.246 --> 59:56.245
Twenty-three boys.

59:56.348 --> 59:59.685
Seventeen girls.

59:59.685 --> 01:00:02.887
Meeting point 20 kilometers
outside Fernando Po.

01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:05.252
The rendezvous with Heron.

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:07.720
Can you get us there?

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.058
If the weather holds,

01:00:10.262 --> 01:00:11.296
I can, sir.

01:00:28.813 --> 01:00:30.310
Twenty quid says
this doesn't end well.

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:32.180
For who?

01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:34.281
For them.

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.613
You can't bet on yourself,
Haysey. That's match-fixing.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:39.616
Let's do it.

01:00:40.889 --> 01:00:42.261
Heron, it's been too long.

01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:44.095
Good to see you, Gus.

01:00:44.095 --> 01:00:45.193
Apple.

01:00:46.899 --> 01:00:49.670
This is Kamp Billy,
the Prince of Fernando Po.

01:00:50.633 --> 01:00:51.938
Your Highness.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.432
He's agreed to help us.

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:57.105
Forgive me, but...

01:00:57.105 --> 01:01:01.076
I have a peculiar feeling
that we've met before.

01:01:01.076 --> 01:01:04.749
I get that a lot.
I'm extremely well-traveled.

01:01:04.749 --> 01:01:07.149
No, no.
It's a particular sense.

01:01:09.954 --> 01:01:13.322
I don't suppose
you played cricket, did you?

01:01:15.528 --> 01:01:18.197
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:20.531
I knew I knew your face!

01:01:20.634 --> 01:01:22.533
Right next
to the trophy cabinet.

01:01:22.636 --> 01:01:25.303
An eight-foot-tall
huge portrait.

01:01:25.303 --> 01:01:28.208
Yes, exactly that!

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.572
One eye on the boundary...

01:01:29.674 --> 01:01:31.167
...one eye on the pub.

01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:32.743
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

01:01:32.845 --> 01:01:34.341
Bloody good
to be here, old boy.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.815
I'm very bored

01:01:36.815 --> 01:01:38.814
with these Nazis making
a nuisance of themselves.

01:01:38.814 --> 01:01:40.351
I mean,
it's terrible for business.

01:01:40.453 --> 01:01:42.181
I'm only too pleased

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:45.358
to help you
serve them a bloody nose.

01:01:45.358 --> 01:01:47.150
That's a commendable attitude.

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.928
So, what's your plan?

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.060
Apple.

01:01:51.566 --> 01:01:52.428
We're going
to sink the <i>Duchessa,</i>

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.194
plus the two tugs.

01:01:54.296 --> 01:01:56.365
Crippling Hitler's
Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

01:01:56.365 --> 01:01:57.900
Very good.

01:01:58.002 --> 01:02:00.373
The thing is,
our old friends the Nazis

01:02:00.373 --> 01:02:01.838
aren't making it the easiest.

01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:04.072
We're outnumbered
two hundred to five.

01:02:04.175 --> 01:02:05.746
There's a few more soldiers
than we anticipated.

01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:08.175
I think that we're gonna have

01:02:08.175 --> 01:02:10.212
to find ourselves
a few more strapping lads.

01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.283
Ade...

01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:23.720
Right...

01:02:27.696 --> 01:02:28.901
Yes, I think that will do.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.869
We brought some weapons
if you need.

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:35.064
You hold onto those.
We brought our own.

01:02:37.943 --> 01:02:40.280
Oyah!
Show them the iron!

01:02:43.241 --> 01:02:44.947
Marvelous.

01:02:44.947 --> 01:02:46.476
You do know
the <i>Duchessa</i> is

01:02:46.578 --> 01:02:48.885
more than 200 feet
from the harbor side?

01:02:48.885 --> 01:02:51.489
And she's in full glare
of the lights.

01:02:51.591 --> 01:02:53.417
She's not gonna be easy to sink

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:55.485
without attracting
unwanted attention.

01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:58.829
Yes. That's why Heron
will plant a bomb

01:02:58.931 --> 01:03:01.225
to blow the lights,
before we paddle in

01:03:01.225 --> 01:03:04.097
and rig the hull
with explosives.

01:03:04.199 --> 01:03:06.470
By the time
the explosives detonate,

01:03:06.572 --> 01:03:07.773
we'll be heading home.

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:09.938
If I had it my way,
a shot'll never be fired.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.510
And how often
do you have it your way?

01:03:12.612 --> 01:03:14.511
Depends on who you ask, old boy.

01:03:16.746 --> 01:03:17.844
Gentlemen...

01:03:17.844 --> 01:03:19.279
- Ade.
- Chief.

01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:21.347
- Prepare the men.

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.417
I'll take that 20
whenever you're ready, Freddy.

01:03:42.273 --> 01:03:43.800
The <i>Duchessa</i>
will be gone by the morning.

01:03:45.009 --> 01:03:46.374
- Can you manage that?

01:03:48.483 --> 01:03:50.807
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

01:03:52.112 --> 01:03:53.513
I'm sure I can cope.

01:03:55.284 --> 01:03:57.187
It's not me you should be
worried about.

01:03:59.793 --> 01:04:01.818
I've never
taken a Nazi to a party.

01:04:04.964 --> 01:04:07.626
Just don't end up
at one of his parties.

01:04:11.703 --> 01:04:12.829
Don't worry about me.

01:04:14.104 --> 01:04:15.909
I'm gonna have
my own little party.

01:04:21.279 --> 01:04:23.147
Drink for the boys,
on His Majesty's government.

01:04:28.052 --> 01:04:30.988
Ordinarily,
I'd bite your hand off,

01:04:30.988 --> 01:04:33.326
as I have been known
to love a pound note.

01:04:37.157 --> 01:04:38.228
But on this occasion,

01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:41.858
the drinks are on me.

01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:44.663
However,

01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:46.907
if His Majesty's government
was handing out titles...

01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:50.006
You're already a prince,
old boy.

01:04:50.006 --> 01:04:53.374
There's Prince
of Fernando Po, but...

01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:56.246
a Knight of the Realm
has a certain antiquity to it.

01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:01.119
Arise, Sir Kamp Billy.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:04.881
You're a good man, Gus.

01:05:05.921 --> 01:05:06.883
Good luck, Billy.

01:05:17.502 --> 01:05:18.730
<i>Hola!</i>

01:05:20.201 --> 01:05:21.975
<i>Buenas tardes, companeros!</i>

01:06:59.397 --> 01:07:00.997
My <i>Herr,</i> you have a visitor.

01:07:04.378 --> 01:07:05.837
Ta-da!

01:07:10.712 --> 01:07:13.009
Cleopatra needs her Caesar.

01:07:13.553 --> 01:07:14.582
Put it on.

01:07:18.282 --> 01:07:19.323
Thank you, Timothy.

01:07:20.285 --> 01:07:21.193
One second.

01:07:21.858 --> 01:07:22.887
Timothy...

01:07:24.698 --> 01:07:26.556
I have a counter offer.

01:07:26.659 --> 01:07:28.934
Let's put
this dressing up aside.

01:07:29.036 --> 01:07:31.665
It's for children.
And we are not children.

01:07:34.973 --> 01:07:36.241
Let's make our own party.

01:07:37.479 --> 01:07:38.672
A dark party.

01:07:39.646 --> 01:07:42.949
A dark Nazi party.

01:07:42.949 --> 01:07:47.219
With music, lubrication
and a handsome Nazi.

01:07:48.656 --> 01:07:50.023
Since I've been here,

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:53.223
I've been bitten by things
that croak and slither,

01:07:53.325 --> 01:07:55.324
scorpions nest in my boots
and I can't sleep

01:07:55.324 --> 01:07:57.361
for the relentless howl
of jungle entropy.

01:07:58.058 --> 01:07:59.328
Tonight,

01:07:59.328 --> 01:08:03.367
I'm going to that party,
and you are taking me.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.140
Now, put it on.

01:08:08.577 --> 01:08:09.373
Oh.

01:08:10.709 --> 01:08:11.973
Very well.

01:08:52.114 --> 01:08:53.615
Ah! <i>Hola!</i>

01:09:08.165 --> 01:09:10.267
We move when the lights go out.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.145
All right, Ricardo,

01:09:30.549 --> 01:09:33.286
today you're <i>El Capitan.</i>

01:09:33.286 --> 01:09:36.829
Armando, the bar is yours.

01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:39.064
Use it. Abuse it at your will.

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:41.865
That's why I love you.

01:09:41.967 --> 01:09:43.669
Come with me, handsome.

01:09:47.537 --> 01:09:49.209
I need you
to keep the men happy.

01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:52.740
How happy?

01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:12.188
Mmm.

01:10:14.968 --> 01:10:17.467
Are the rats in the nest?

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:21.069
You won't find a German,
Spanish or Italian officer

01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:22.503
anywhere else tonight.

01:10:28.545 --> 01:10:29.914
Between the beer fest
at the harbor

01:10:30.016 --> 01:10:31.680
and this little get-together,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.045
that'll be 90% of the soldiers
away from the dock.

01:10:35.586 --> 01:10:37.556
The charge is set
to blow the harbor lights

01:10:37.659 --> 01:10:38.423
in 30 minutes.

01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:42.557
Can you keep him here that long?

01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:45.221
Silly boy, silly question.
Look at the dress.

01:10:55.741 --> 01:10:56.776
Hi.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:59.036
So, you call this a party?

01:10:59.036 --> 01:11:00.707
This is just
the thin end of the wedge.

01:11:00.707 --> 01:11:03.313
I've created a performance
just for you.

01:11:03.313 --> 01:11:06.114
Well, I could show you
a real party.

01:11:33.544 --> 01:11:34.777
Why do I care, Spaghetti?

01:11:34.879 --> 01:11:37.082
Pizza.

01:11:37.082 --> 01:11:39.182
Excuse me
while I powder my nose.

01:11:39.182 --> 01:11:41.077
- What, again?

01:11:41.077 --> 01:11:43.549
Don't panic, Caesar.
Brush up on your Italian.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:46.191
Your gift needs to be wrapped.

01:11:46.191 --> 01:11:48.094
Keep those officers
drinking, please.

01:11:48.094 --> 01:11:50.086
- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you, Femi.

01:11:50.086 --> 01:11:51.958
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

01:11:52.998 --> 01:11:53.795
It won't sink.

01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:56.363
We need to stop the mission.

01:12:03.109 --> 01:12:04.436
That's going to be hard to do.

01:12:04.436 --> 01:12:06.042
Listen to me.

01:12:06.144 --> 01:12:07.440
Our mission will fail.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.742
The explosives won't work

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:11.307
because he's reinforced it
to be unsinkable.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.013
You have to stop them now.

01:12:17.115 --> 01:12:19.989
But the charge is about
to blow the lights.

01:12:21.984 --> 01:12:23.057
Well, if you can't
stop the lights,

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.193
stop the men.

01:12:24.295 --> 01:12:26.025
Luhr must not leave this party.

01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:28.962
I'll keep him busy. Go, now.

01:13:08.536 --> 01:13:10.073
And we're off.

01:13:10.175 --> 01:13:11.437
Gus, wait.

01:13:31.232 --> 01:13:33.565
Stork to Maid,
Stork to Maid, come in.

01:13:35.034 --> 01:13:36.291
Channel five.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:37.393
<i>This is Maid. Switching to 20.</i>

01:13:40.566 --> 01:13:42.141
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:44.268
Tin of corned beef
can't be cracked.

01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.611
<i>The ship cannot be sunk.</i>

01:13:47.575 --> 01:13:49.240
<i>Explosives will fail.</i>

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.874
It's Stork, sir.

01:13:51.874 --> 01:13:52.881
Put him on open speaker.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:55.983
<i>Corned beef
can't be cracked.</i>

01:13:56.616 --> 01:13:57.916
Stork, this is M.

01:13:58.018 --> 01:13:59.982
Never mind the corned beef.
Just find a way.

01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:02.184
- Over.
- Pound incoming, sir.

01:14:02.184 --> 01:14:03.492
-<i>Repeat...</i>
- Switch that off.

01:14:03.492 --> 01:14:04.464
<i>- We must...</i>

01:14:06.198 --> 01:14:08.396
Stop this immediately.

01:14:08.396 --> 01:14:11.437
What you are doing ends now,

01:14:11.539 --> 01:14:13.729
or every last one of you
will be subject to a tribunal.

01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:15.572
Is that clear?

01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:17.609
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

01:14:19.047 --> 01:14:21.437
Is that correct, Sergeant?

01:14:25.319 --> 01:14:26.546
<i>Hold position.</i>

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:28.848
<i>How long, Stork?</i>

01:14:28.848 --> 01:14:29.922
-<i>Awaiting orders.</i>
- Give me that.

01:14:29.922 --> 01:14:30.820
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:33.349
March-Phillips,

01:14:33.349 --> 01:14:36.192
this is Admiral Pound
giving you a direct order.

01:14:36.294 --> 01:14:37.923
Abort this mission now.

01:14:37.923 --> 01:14:39.123
<i>I will make sure that</i>

01:14:39.123 --> 01:14:41.058
<i>none of you see
the light of day again.</i>

01:14:41.058 --> 01:14:42.532
<i>You will spend
the rest of your lives</i>

01:14:42.532 --> 01:14:44.433
<i>locked up
at His Majesty's pleasure.</i>

01:14:44.433 --> 01:14:45.301
<i>That includes all of you.</i>

01:14:45.301 --> 01:14:47.136
<i>Geoffrey Appleyard,</i>

01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:48.307
<i>Anders Lassen,</i>

01:14:48.307 --> 01:14:49.305
<i>- Freddy Buzz...</i>
-I'm sorry...

01:14:49.305 --> 01:14:50.536
<i>...and Henry Hayes.</i>

01:14:50.536 --> 01:14:51.806
Can't quite make out

01:14:51.908 --> 01:14:52.974
- what you're saying.

01:14:54.474 --> 01:14:56.041
Bye.

01:14:56.143 --> 01:14:57.345
- Is... Is that clear?

01:14:57.345 --> 01:14:59.043
<i>Sorry? What?</i>

01:14:59.043 --> 01:15:00.919
<i>I can't...
I can't quite hear you.</i>

01:15:01.944 --> 01:15:03.479
<i>Please... fuck off.</i>

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.157
You and your operation
are reckless, Brigadier.

01:15:12.432 --> 01:15:14.225
I will personally
advise parliament

01:15:14.225 --> 01:15:17.399
to have the Prime Minister
removed from office.

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:19.132
And I am going to shut you down.

01:15:20.539 --> 01:15:23.367
Message received
loud and clear, sir.

01:15:30.011 --> 01:15:32.811
I suggest you also
fuck off, Sergeant.

01:15:32.811 --> 01:15:34.510
Fleming, contact March-Phillips.

01:15:38.954 --> 01:15:40.557
Lily, get me
the Prime Minister on hotline.

01:15:40.557 --> 01:15:41.851
-<i>Right away, sir.</i>
- Come in, 01.

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:43.259
Come in, do you receive?

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:49.863
- Yes?
-<i>Prime Minister,</i>

01:15:49.863 --> 01:15:51.527
<i>I'm afraid
we've been discovered.</i>

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:55.832
There was a mole in our midst

01:15:55.832 --> 01:15:57.067
and Admiral Pound

01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:58.974
has ordered the mission
to be aborted.

01:15:58.974 --> 01:16:01.537
<i>He wants to have parliament
remove you from office.</i>

01:16:02.678 --> 01:16:04.006
The mission must continue.

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:05.649
01, this is base. Over.

01:16:05.649 --> 01:16:07.013
<i>Tell Pound
if he has a problem,</i>

01:16:07.013 --> 01:16:09.155
<i>to take it up with me.
He knows where I live.</i>

01:16:09.155 --> 01:16:10.885
<i>Tell the men to press on.</i>

01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:13.219
I'm afraid we've lost
all communication, sir.

01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.297
There must be
something that we can do.

01:16:18.399 --> 01:16:21.266
The only thing
I can do is remind you,

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:23.468
the reason
we chose March-Phillips

01:16:23.468 --> 01:16:25.803
<i>is because
he doesn't follow orders.</i>

01:16:28.836 --> 01:16:30.368
Then let's hope we chose well.

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:38.073
The <i>Duchessa's</i> hull
has been reinforced.

01:16:38.175 --> 01:16:40.049
Which means she can't be sunk.

01:16:40.049 --> 01:16:43.380
At least not with the amount
of explosives we're carrying.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.722
Just wondering how and when
exactly this took place.

01:16:45.722 --> 01:16:47.590
It's not important
how and when, it's happened.

01:16:47.692 --> 01:16:49.659
Well, it is
kind of important, Gus.

01:16:49.659 --> 01:16:51.762
I don't care
about the prison time,

01:16:51.864 --> 01:16:53.659
but I do care about finishing
what we've started.

01:16:53.659 --> 01:16:55.027
Thank you, Freddy.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.135
There must be
some sort of mistake.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.269
You can't just reinforce...

01:16:57.269 --> 01:16:59.097
There's no mistake, Haysey.

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:00.865
I'm just lost about
how and when exactly...

01:17:00.865 --> 01:17:02.103
- Enough!

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:12.113
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

01:17:13.652 --> 01:17:15.083
Get rid of the shuttle
to the U-boats.

01:17:16.387 --> 01:17:18.113
It's not enough.

01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:19.186
They'll replace them in a week.

01:17:29.401 --> 01:17:30.498
Why don't we steal them?

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.900
We can use Billy's boat

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.736
to drag the <i>Duchessa</i>
out of the harbor

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.306
and steal the other two
German tug boats

01:17:35.306 --> 01:17:36.639
that service the U-boats.

01:17:36.741 --> 01:17:38.535
And how are
we supposed to do that?

01:17:38.535 --> 01:17:42.142
Not only is she double-plated,
weighing twice as much,

01:17:42.244 --> 01:17:43.941
but you'd need a full crew
to move a ship that size.

01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:45.682
The tug boats are the crew.

01:17:45.682 --> 01:17:47.346
We tow the <i>Duchessa</i>
out to the ocean

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.720
and, well, steal the lot.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.319
Then what?
We still can't sink them.

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:55.790
We don't need to.

01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:57.386
We sail
into international waters

01:17:57.488 --> 01:17:58.956
and hand everything
over to the Navy.

01:17:58.956 --> 01:18:00.324
They're following us anyway,

01:18:00.324 --> 01:18:01.497
so they'll be more than happy
to see us again.

01:18:01.497 --> 01:18:03.032
And what about the anchor?

01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:05.570
Have you seen the size of it?

01:18:05.672 --> 01:18:07.462
If we're gonna
actually start to move her,

01:18:07.462 --> 01:18:09.538
their S-boats
will catch us in seconds.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.906
Well, what are you going to do

01:18:10.906 --> 01:18:12.041
with all the explosives
you brought, Freddy?

01:18:13.976 --> 01:18:15.911
We'll use them
to blow the anchor.

01:18:15.911 --> 01:18:18.243
We'll rig the S-boats
so they can't follow,

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:20.417
rig the fuel reserve
that supplies the U-boats,

01:18:20.519 --> 01:18:24.181
and then, well, blow the lot up.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:25.855
That fuel explosion's
gonna bring

01:18:25.957 --> 01:18:27.424
everyone and their mother
down to the harbor.

01:18:27.526 --> 01:18:29.158
We set the fuse,

01:18:29.158 --> 01:18:31.593
so that the fuel dump blows
once we're outside the harbor.

01:18:31.695 --> 01:18:34.096
Then we sneak out quietly.

01:18:35.728 --> 01:18:36.692
Not bad.

01:18:38.405 --> 01:18:40.003
It's very greedy.

01:18:41.871 --> 01:18:44.436
- Well, I'm in.
-Well,

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:47.777
I'm not leaving until I have
a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

01:18:47.777 --> 01:18:49.881
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do, sir.

01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:53.610
Gentlemen,

01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:00.221
let's steal some boats.

01:19:09.595 --> 01:19:12.728
Turns out she's double-plated,
so change of plans.

01:19:14.598 --> 01:19:16.238
We're going
to steal the boats instead.

01:19:19.445 --> 01:19:20.736
Is that even possible?

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.739
I'm not entirely sure.

01:19:26.785 --> 01:19:28.117
But if you're up for it,
so are we.

01:19:29.379 --> 01:19:30.449
And you know what that means.

01:19:31.955 --> 01:19:34.459
A lot more blood
and a lot more sweat.

01:19:34.562 --> 01:19:36.158
Hopefully not any of ours,
old boy.

01:19:38.393 --> 01:19:40.327
I don't think we can do this
without you, Billy.

01:19:49.707 --> 01:19:52.174
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

01:19:54.406 --> 01:19:55.742
I think we're gonna
need your tug.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:00.850
Haysey and I will
take a stroll along the harbor

01:20:00.952 --> 01:20:03.754
and take out
any soldiers still patrolling.

01:20:03.754 --> 01:20:05.489
Freddy will bring
his dinghy around

01:20:05.591 --> 01:20:06.755
and take care of the S-boats.

01:20:06.755 --> 01:20:07.860
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

01:20:09.453 --> 01:20:10.757
And the <i>Duchessa?</i>

01:20:10.757 --> 01:20:12.324
That's Apple and me.

01:20:12.427 --> 01:20:14.896
We'll take care of any crew
and blow the anchor.

01:20:14.896 --> 01:20:16.099
And destroy their comms.

01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:20.067
Not sure
what you'll meet on board.

01:20:20.067 --> 01:20:22.538
Take my top boy
and two more of my men.

01:20:24.643 --> 01:20:26.472
Gentlemen, let's prepare.

01:20:34.785 --> 01:20:37.818
<i>♪ Oh, the shark, babe</i>

01:20:37.818 --> 01:20:41.022

01:22:46.415 --> 01:22:48.083

01:22:51.325 --> 01:22:52.123
<i>Mein Herr.</i>

01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:00.190
Haysey...

01:23:48.048 --> 01:23:49.072
Up there
on the left, sir.

01:23:49.174 --> 01:23:50.673
Yes.

01:23:53.883 --> 01:23:54.916
He made a crash!

01:24:09.995 --> 01:24:12.335
We could take that car, sir.
Save us some shoe leather.

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:49.369
<i>♪ Look out, old Macky is back ♪</i>

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.329
Incoming.

01:25:26.745 --> 01:25:29.079
Papers please.

01:25:29.079 --> 01:25:30.846
- Commander.
- All good, Freddy?

01:25:30.948 --> 01:25:32.246
Charges are set to go

01:25:32.246 --> 01:25:33.108
once we're out
of the harbor, sir.

01:25:34.919 --> 01:25:36.445
Let's carry on then.

01:25:51.763 --> 01:25:53.128
Did you enjoy your gift?

01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:54.998
Mmm.

01:25:57.304 --> 01:26:00.308
I think now it's time

01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:04.139
that the fox shows his den
to the vixen.

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:41.011
Heron, why are
the lights still on?

01:26:42.383 --> 01:26:43.847
I lit the room with oil lamps,

01:26:43.847 --> 01:26:45.554
so they wouldn't notice
when the power went out.

01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:29.433
- Look out!

01:27:47.348 --> 01:27:48.745
Freddy, rig this 88,

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.245
then take the first tug
with Haysey.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.892
<i>- Gute nacht.
- Guten abend.</i>

01:28:00.998 --> 01:28:02.463
<i>Guten abend.</i>

01:28:28.459 --> 01:28:29.622
Terribly sorry, old boy.

01:28:29.724 --> 01:28:31.195
- Do you mind? I seem to...

01:28:31.195 --> 01:28:33.565
- ...have misplaced my knife.

01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:39.354
- Bugger!

01:29:46.796 --> 01:29:47.571
Thank you, Billy.

01:29:56.213 --> 01:29:58.279
- Oh!

01:30:54.472 --> 01:30:56.134
I hope that's
not your blood, Lassen.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.901
I hope so too.

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.876
Okay, boys, cast off.

01:31:06.876 --> 01:31:07.948
Let's get this ship out of here.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.322
Go on. Go on...

01:31:19.799 --> 01:31:21.258
Go on!

01:31:25.132 --> 01:31:27.968
There's three
more rooms just like this one.

01:31:27.968 --> 01:31:30.135
That should stop the U-boats
for the next six months.

01:31:31.972 --> 01:31:33.374
Let's get this thing
towed out of here.

01:31:33.374 --> 01:31:35.002
We are here, boys.

01:31:35.104 --> 01:31:36.680
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

01:31:42.850 --> 01:31:44.014
I need you to go
to the front of the boat

01:31:44.014 --> 01:31:45.982
and attach the <i>Vulcan</i>
to the <i>Duchessa,</i>

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:47.288
Lassen and I
will head to the bridge.

01:31:47.288 --> 01:31:49.154
Okay.

01:31:50.759 --> 01:31:52.795
Take the right side.

01:31:52.795 --> 01:31:54.390
And you, get up there
and get this thing started.

01:32:06.979 --> 01:32:08.008
It's Gus.

01:32:09.545 --> 01:32:10.549
Everyone's in place.

01:32:13.611 --> 01:32:14.981
What,

01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:16.720
you didn't actually think
it would work, did you?

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:18.887
It was your plan.

01:32:20.016 --> 01:32:21.048
Well, let's make sure

01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:22.952
we keep our end of the bargain.

01:32:22.952 --> 01:32:24.420
Signal back and I'll heave off.

01:32:27.133 --> 01:32:28.795
So, what happens now?

01:32:28.795 --> 01:32:30.432
We wait for
the anchor chain to blow.

01:32:30.535 --> 01:32:32.270
When do
we expect that to happen?

01:32:32.372 --> 01:32:34.337
- Shortly, I hope.

01:32:34.337 --> 01:32:36.631
And then we're free to take her.

01:32:36.631 --> 01:32:41.107
However, the real race begins
once the fuel depot goes.

01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:43.439
Then we'll have every soldier
on the island turning up.

01:32:45.683 --> 01:32:47.784
We don't wanna
be around to witness that.

01:32:49.353 --> 01:32:50.651
How long was that fuse

01:32:50.651 --> 01:32:51.755
you attached
to the anchor chain?

01:32:53.226 --> 01:32:54.223
We'll find out soon enough.

01:32:56.025 --> 01:32:57.260
Wait for it,
you're gonna catch the rope.

01:33:08.699 --> 01:33:09.564
Come on.

01:33:29.624 --> 01:33:30.959
First domino falls.

01:33:32.895 --> 01:33:34.295
- Hitch up the other line.
- Yes, boss.

01:33:34.397 --> 01:33:35.425
Pick up the slack.

01:33:37.727 --> 01:33:39.836
They need to move her
before the fuel dump blows.

01:33:41.438 --> 01:33:42.898
Heron, we need Marjorie.

01:33:42.898 --> 01:33:44.933
Leave Marjorie to me.

01:33:45.035 --> 01:33:46.172
We'll catch you up.

01:33:47.046 --> 01:33:48.075
Very good.

01:33:48.773 --> 01:33:50.080
Let's go!

01:34:34.417 --> 01:34:35.958
I have to say, <i>Fraulein,</i>

01:34:38.626 --> 01:34:39.654
you were good.

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:42.657
And you were sly.

01:34:43.866 --> 01:34:45.566
There are only
two types of people

01:34:45.668 --> 01:34:47.662
that are as sly as the fox.

01:34:48.833 --> 01:34:49.664
The German

01:34:51.143 --> 01:34:52.469
and the Jew.

01:34:55.545 --> 01:34:59.542
And you are not German.

01:35:00.715 --> 01:35:02.349
I think now it's time...

01:35:04.514 --> 01:35:06.353
- ...for a real party.

01:35:17.130 --> 01:35:19.229
That wasn't
supposed to happen yet.

01:35:23.967 --> 01:35:25.106
Shackle her!

01:35:26.003 --> 01:35:26.778
And follow me.

01:35:30.581 --> 01:35:32.183
The harbor is under attack!

01:35:52.503 --> 01:35:53.530
They're coming.

01:35:58.609 --> 01:35:59.910
We need power on the engine.

01:36:04.541 --> 01:36:06.741
- She's too heavy!
- Pick up the slack!

01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:20.055
Wait...

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.001
She's not moving!

01:36:26.736 --> 01:36:29.305
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:36:29.407 --> 01:36:30.272
Wait for it.

01:36:51.422 --> 01:36:53.222
We need
more power on the engine.

01:36:53.222 --> 01:36:55.696
Give me more power! More power!

01:36:57.227 --> 01:36:58.595
That's it, it's working!

01:36:59.736 --> 01:37:00.703
- That's it!

01:37:27.929 --> 01:37:28.900
Ready!

01:37:50.513 --> 01:37:51.890
-  Haysey!

01:38:52.013 --> 01:38:53.710
We're out of range now.

01:38:55.612 --> 01:38:57.120
- I'm no expert.

01:38:57.222 --> 01:38:59.655
But you've got a big old hole
in your shoulder, Haysey.

01:39:47.771 --> 01:39:49.401
Captain,

01:39:49.401 --> 01:39:51.669
would you explain to me
what's going on here?

01:39:52.907 --> 01:39:54.877
The power is gone.

01:39:54.979 --> 01:39:57.307
The fuel depot
has been sabotaged.

01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:58.482
And no one knows
what's happening.

01:39:58.584 --> 01:39:59.680
But this is your fault.

01:39:59.782 --> 01:40:01.019
Where is my ship?

01:40:02.953 --> 01:40:04.548
The <i>Duchessa,</i> where did it go?

01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:06.816
Someone's taken him
while you weren't looking.

01:40:07.855 --> 01:40:09.286
You idiot!

01:40:09.286 --> 01:40:10.825
You always have to say something

01:40:10.825 --> 01:40:12.657
at the very wrong time.

01:40:13.932 --> 01:40:16.562
There is never
a right time with you!

01:40:17.637 --> 01:40:18.902
Your greed and perversion

01:40:18.902 --> 01:40:20.967
has distracted you
from your duties.

01:40:20.967 --> 01:40:22.737
Now my harbor is destroyed.

01:40:22.839 --> 01:40:24.174
And my ship is gone!

01:40:28.012 --> 01:40:30.844
And now you're gone too.
Thank you.

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.034
Impressive.

01:41:03.147 --> 01:41:04.272
Sounds like
your detonators worked.

01:41:41.511 --> 01:41:43.616
<i>Chapeau, mademoiselle.</i>

01:41:43.718 --> 01:41:46.949
You play well.
You really are the vixen.

01:41:48.284 --> 01:41:49.083
Am I?

01:41:51.093 --> 01:41:52.757
Well, my hand's been revealed.

01:41:56.569 --> 01:41:58.800
So, what now?

01:41:58.902 --> 01:42:02.797
Now, I possess your hand

01:42:02.899 --> 01:42:04.901
and for everything
you have done to me,

01:42:06.375 --> 01:42:09.644
I will visit
a thousand fold upon you.

01:42:16.919 --> 01:42:17.947
Yeah.

01:42:25.321 --> 01:42:26.120
But no.

01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:41.443
- Lie down.

01:42:45.246 --> 01:42:48.142
Gus, we can't wait much longer.

01:42:51.756 --> 01:42:52.852
They're coming.

01:42:52.955 --> 01:42:54.484
If we stay here,

01:42:54.587 --> 01:42:56.627
we'll lose contact
with the others.

01:42:56.627 --> 01:42:58.590
Hold fast, Billy.

01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:01.226
Heron has a way of surviving
and Marjorie,

01:43:01.328 --> 01:43:03.993
well... good luck with that.

01:43:09.306 --> 01:43:11.066
That's a patrol boat
coming towards us.

01:43:15.609 --> 01:43:17.171
- Gus, we need to leave. Now.

01:43:18.441 --> 01:43:19.580
Hold on...

01:43:31.993 --> 01:43:33.022
It's them.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:35.860
RH.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.169
- KB.
-Marjorie.

01:43:39.169 --> 01:43:41.437
Overdressed and underdressed
at the same time.

01:43:44.474 --> 01:43:46.200
Come on, let's get you
out of those shackles.

01:43:51.781 --> 01:43:53.982
Come in, <i>Violet.</i>

01:43:53.982 --> 01:43:55.209
Calling <i>H.M.S. Violet.</i>

01:43:56.822 --> 01:43:58.045
<i>Come in,</i> Violet.

01:43:58.045 --> 01:43:59.383
<i>This is</i> Maid Honor.

01:43:59.383 --> 01:44:00.390
Go ahead, <i>Maid Honor.</i>

01:44:01.421 --> 01:44:03.383
- Loudspeaker.

01:44:03.383 --> 01:44:04.953
<i>Sorry to bother you
at this time of the night,</i>

01:44:05.056 --> 01:44:06.657
but we've found ourselves
with one or two items

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:07.529
that might be
of interest to you.

01:44:09.168 --> 01:44:10.598
<i>Shall we rendezvous
for a handover?</i>

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.663
Get me Admiral Pound.

01:44:23.376 --> 01:44:25.007
- Yes?
<i>Sir,</i>

01:44:25.007 --> 01:44:27.313
<i>- good news and bad news.</i>
- Yes, yes. Get to it.

01:44:27.313 --> 01:44:29.045
<i>Bad news, they didn't sink her.</i>

01:44:29.853 --> 01:44:30.915
<i>Good news,</i>

01:44:31.691 --> 01:44:32.620
<i>they stole her.</i>

01:44:34.124 --> 01:44:36.389
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

01:45:04.582 --> 01:45:05.455
Hold it there!

01:45:06.758 --> 01:45:08.024
Commander.

01:45:08.126 --> 01:45:09.584
You were ordered
by Admiral Pound

01:45:09.584 --> 01:45:10.727
to cease activities.

01:45:10.727 --> 01:45:12.757
You did not.

01:45:12.757 --> 01:45:14.259
Therefore, you are
to be returned to England

01:45:14.259 --> 01:45:16.827
to face a tribunal. You.

01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:20.269
Return to your tug
with the rest of your militia.

01:45:20.269 --> 01:45:21.598
- Take them to the brig.
-Sir!

01:45:21.598 --> 01:45:24.366
Good to see you too, Commander.

01:45:24.469 --> 01:45:26.139
Separate cells.

01:45:26.139 --> 01:45:28.175
Follow me!

01:45:28.277 --> 01:45:29.809
Let's go! Let's get moving!

01:45:31.684 --> 01:45:33.145
- RH.
- KB.

01:45:33.145 --> 01:45:34.209
Come on.

01:45:35.688 --> 01:45:37.051
Go on, move.

01:45:37.153 --> 01:45:37.949
One moment, seaman.

01:45:42.287 --> 01:45:43.317
Billy.

01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:46.628
One eye on the boundary...

01:45:48.527 --> 01:45:49.499
One eye on the pub.

01:45:51.764 --> 01:45:53.327
They'll thank you
for this one day.

01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:55.603
I'm not sure

01:45:55.603 --> 01:45:57.034
that's what we were
really looking for, was it,

01:45:58.371 --> 01:45:59.333
Your Highness?

01:46:01.345 --> 01:46:03.909
Shop's open
for you anytime, Major.

01:46:14.821 --> 01:46:16.457
Sorry to intrude,
Prime Minister,

01:46:16.457 --> 01:46:17.824
but M thought
you should see this.

01:46:23.464 --> 01:46:24.358
Thank you, Gloria.

01:46:34.742 --> 01:46:37.239
-Line up. Face front!

01:46:38.478 --> 01:46:43.281
Line up. Face front!

01:46:43.383 --> 01:46:44.455
No need to shout.

01:46:47.894 --> 01:46:49.653
Stand still!

01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:51.385
Any chance of a cup of tea?

01:46:52.361 --> 01:46:53.721
You, back up to the wall.

01:46:53.823 --> 01:46:54.960
Off the cloth, moth.

01:46:56.199 --> 01:46:57.292
Stand straight!

01:47:08.843 --> 01:47:10.741
Never before
have the senior Military

01:47:10.843 --> 01:47:13.074
and Navy Commanders
of this country

01:47:13.074 --> 01:47:14.782
been so united
in their condemnation.

01:47:15.712 --> 01:47:17.085
It is their view

01:47:17.187 --> 01:47:18.847
that the discipline

01:47:18.847 --> 01:47:21.721
on which
our armed forces depends

01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:24.726
has been undermined
by men serving no master

01:47:24.726 --> 01:47:27.729
but their own thirst
for blood, murder and mayhem.

01:47:30.102 --> 01:47:31.565
Men who disobeyed a direct order

01:47:31.565 --> 01:47:32.899
from the Admiral
of the fleet himself,

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:35.737
and chose instead

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.432
to trust the whim and intuition

01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:41.435
of the man standing beside him.

01:47:43.212 --> 01:47:44.438
How dare they.

01:47:47.118 --> 01:47:49.618
When only this morning,

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:52.916
the first American soldiers
arrived on British soil,

01:47:52.916 --> 01:47:54.187
ready to stand
shoulder to shoulder

01:47:54.289 --> 01:47:55.317
with us in Europe.

01:47:57.057 --> 01:47:59.255
Allies who risked death
crossing the North Atlantic,

01:48:00.956 --> 01:48:02.632
and only by some miracle

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:08.099
found their crossing
untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

01:48:10.573 --> 01:48:12.466
A happy circumstance,
I might add,

01:48:13.838 --> 01:48:16.172
which cannot be accounted for,

01:48:16.274 --> 01:48:18.774
but which has cleared the way
for the United States

01:48:18.774 --> 01:48:20.775
to enter the European war.

01:48:20.775 --> 01:48:22.485
And for which I know

01:48:22.588 --> 01:48:26.282
President Roosevelt
to be immeasurably grateful.

01:48:29.918 --> 01:48:31.052
But setting aside

01:48:31.154 --> 01:48:34.397
this stroke
of unexplained fortune,

01:48:34.499 --> 01:48:37.562
what is to be done
with this unruly company

01:48:37.562 --> 01:48:39.333
who do not obey orders?

01:48:39.333 --> 01:48:40.734
Who seem to have formed

01:48:40.734 --> 01:48:44.636
their own ministry
of ungentlemanly warfare.

01:48:49.544 --> 01:48:51.208
From now on, they work for me.
