00:07.833 --> 00:08.958
Don't worry, brother.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.291
Thank you.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.625
You are not Mandalorian.

00:17.708 --> 00:19.125
He's one of them.

00:19.208 --> 00:20.208
One of what?

00:22.083 --> 00:23.375
MOFF GIDEON: <i>The Darksaber.</i>

00:26.000 --> 00:28.625
In order for her
to wield the Darksaber again,

00:28.708 --> 00:31.083
it must be won in battle.

00:33.291 --> 00:35.208
What of your plans to retake Mandalore?

00:35.291 --> 00:39.000
When I returned without the Darksaber,
my forces melted away.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.541
Where is the stolen fleet?

00:40.625 --> 00:43.541
Making their way through the galaxy
as mercenaries.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.333
I am going to Mandalore.

00:46.541 --> 00:47.541
No!

01:01.583 --> 01:03.500
(POWERING DOWN)

01:03.583 --> 01:05.666
Without the Creed, what are we?

01:05.750 --> 01:07.250
What do we stand for?

01:08.125 --> 01:11.291
Our people are scattered
like stars in the galaxy.

01:11.875 --> 01:15.083
You rescued me
and I'll always be in your debt.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.958
Remove your helmet.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.458
Our people have strayed from the Way

01:25.333 --> 01:27.541
and it is not enough for a few to walk it.

01:29.625 --> 01:34.666
Bo-Katan Kryze is going off
to bring other Mandalorians in exile to us

01:34.750 --> 01:37.041
so that we may join together once again.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.958
But she shows her face.

01:39.041 --> 01:41.791
Bo-Katan walks both worlds.

01:41.875 --> 01:44.291
She can bring all tribes together.

01:45.625 --> 01:48.833

03:41.250 --> 03:43.625

<i>I am not a criminal.</i>

03:53.541 --> 03:54.791
Of course not.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.833
I intended no disrespect.

03:56.916 --> 03:58.875
Basic is not my native tongue.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.083
I meant to say that we were not aware

04:02.166 --> 04:04.791
of the majestic Imperial presence
in this sector,

04:05.541 --> 04:07.708
and we will gladly hire your protection.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.166
SHIP CAPTAIN: We are not Imperial either.

04:16.708 --> 04:17.750
We are Mandalorian.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.916
And, sadly, you're too late to hire us.

04:22.958 --> 04:26.000
You see, we've been commissioned
to track you down, Captain Shuggoth.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.166
This is an act of war.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.875
AXE WOVES: <i>"War?"</i> (LAUGHS)

04:34.791 --> 04:37.875
We're privateers. Individuals for hire.

04:38.583 --> 04:42.541
The price is high
but we are very good at what we do.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.666
<i>Loyal as well.</i>

04:45.791 --> 04:48.333
<i>Which is why we cannot accept</i>
<i>your generous offer.</i>

04:48.416 --> 04:51.791
You see, we were already hired
by a certain Mon Calamari Viceroy

04:51.875 --> 04:55.208
who has reason to believe
you absconded with her son.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.166
It's a lie.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.791
We finally have peace with the Calamari.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.416
Why would I jeopardize
peace and prosperity?

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
<i>We have all suffered too much from war.</i>

05:05.083 --> 05:06.750
I didn't say anything about war.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.041
I know it was for love.

05:10.416 --> 05:11.708
But my job is not to judge,

05:11.791 --> 05:14.708
but simply to complete the tasks
for which we were hired.

05:14.791 --> 05:18.958

Okay, let's make this quick.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.333
We got a contract

05:44.125 --> 05:45.500
You have to go with them.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.458
No. I love you.

05:47.541 --> 05:48.666
Please go.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.583
I can't destroy everything I've built
for a childish fling.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.833
(STAMMERS) Is that all this was to you?

05:54.916 --> 05:56.583
No, that's not what I meant.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.666
But you need to go.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.750
We knew fate was not on our side.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.458
Who cares about fate? I love you.

07:09.666 --> 07:11.583
It took me a long time to assemble it.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.416
Most of it was captured from the Empire.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.083
THE MANDALORIAN:
I knew they looked familiar.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.458
Could come in real handy
taking back Mandalore.

07:19.541 --> 07:21.708
Axe Woves is their leader now.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.791
It's going to take some convincing
to get them to join us.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.625
THE MANDALORIAN:
I wonder what they're here for?

07:27.708 --> 07:30.000
This planet
isn't on the New Republic Registry,

07:30.083 --> 07:34.000
so I'd guess it's an independent world
that hired them for protection.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.916
THE MANDALORIAN: Can't imagine
Woves will be happy to see you.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.041
Yeah.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.125
I'll land outside the fleet's perimeter.

-They were.

13:39.833 --> 13:40.958
THE DUTCHESS: Obviously not.

13:41.041 --> 13:44.041
The Mandalorian garrison
outside your city walls

13:44.125 --> 13:46.250

13:46.333 --> 13:49.000

-What?

13:49.083 --> 13:52.041
Our charter forbids any standing army

to carry blasters.

You want us to eliminate
your droid problem.

14:12.708 --> 14:13.791
Exactly.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.000
I knew you would help us.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.083
Hold on there, Your Majesty.
We didn't agree to help you.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.833
Please, Princess Kryze. Your Grace.

14:19.916 --> 14:22.541
This is not intended
to be a work of charity.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.333
Unlike my brethren
outside your city walls,

14:25.416 --> 14:26.458
I am not a mercenary.

14:26.541 --> 14:28.750
Apologies if that
is the impression I gave.

14:28.833 --> 14:33.333
What I intended to convey
is that I would hope that this "excursion"

14:33.416 --> 14:37.375
would be viewed as an act of diplomacy
between our two planets.

14:37.458 --> 14:42.541
In fact, Plazir-15 would formally
recognize Mandalore as a sovereign system

14:42.625 --> 14:45.583
and petition the New Republic
to recognize it as such.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.750
The mercenary captain, Axe Woves,
indicated that he split from you

14:49.833 --> 14:52.916
because you had designs
on ruling Mandalore once again.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.500
Those plans have been abandoned.

14:56.416 --> 14:58.375
The offer stands nonetheless.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.250
What do you think?

15:01.958 --> 15:04.041
THE MANDALORIAN:
You had me at "battle droids."

15:05.708 --> 15:09.666
These droids were all reprogrammed
to serve the community

15:09.750 --> 15:13.791
from the stockpile
of captured Imperial robotics

15:13.875 --> 15:16.791
scheduled to be scrapped at Karthon.

15:18.416 --> 15:21.250
The droid's reprogramming
was a complete success,

15:22.583 --> 15:25.583

16:08.583 --> 16:09.625
I am.

There's a failsafe cutoff switch
built into the system.

-What?

16:24.541 --> 16:25.958

The citizens
are no longer required to work

and can spend their days
engaging in recreation,

and participating in our direct democracy.

16:37.458 --> 16:43.375
If we shut down the droids, (LAUGHS)
our citizens wouldn't know how to survive.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.791
Our society would collapse.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.958
Then what do you want from us?

16:49.041 --> 16:52.833
To seek out and decommission
any remaining rogue droids,

16:52.916 --> 16:56.000
until we can fix the problem.

and speak to the Ugnaughts.

in the world above.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.125
I've spent time with Ugnaughts.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.708
There's a particular way
to communicate with them.

19:42.791 --> 19:45.416
Accusing their work
of malfunctioning is an insult.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.916
Now, they've indicated
that there's a likelihood

19:49.000 --> 19:51.166
that the next event
will be at the loading docks.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.791
How sure are they?

-Ugnaughts always seem sure of themselves.

28:14.958 --> 28:17.083
The particles are definitely present.

that they're still active?

28:54.083 --> 28:55.416
-Curious...
-What?

28:56.833 --> 28:58.791
They're actually nano-droids.

28:59.416 --> 29:01.458
How did nano-droids get into the Nepenthé?

29:04.541 --> 29:05.791
What's that?

29:05.875 --> 29:07.000
LAB TECH: The striations?

29:07.750 --> 29:09.375
Just an aberration in the metal.

Probably malleability

29:18.416 --> 29:20.625
(BEEPING)

29:23.916 --> 29:24.958
It's a chain code.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.833
If it has a chain code,

29:26.916 --> 29:29.333
then we should be able
to determine its point of origin.

29:29.416 --> 29:30.416
LAB TECH: In theory.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.416
Let me see what I can find out.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.791
(BEEPING)

29:34.416 --> 29:35.833
Yes, here we are.

They were originally manufactured
by the Techno Union.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.333
Been in cold-storage for ages.

29:42.458 --> 29:45.916
The chain title says it didn't arrive
on Plazir through Droid Acquisitions.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.083
How strange...

29:48.166 --> 29:49.458
How did it arrive?

29:50.458 --> 29:52.833
They were requisitioned
by the Security Office.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.000
Is that unusual?

29:56.458 --> 29:57.625
It's illegal.

29:58.375 --> 30:01.875
There's no record of this transaction
on the government registry.

30:01.958 --> 30:05.208
These droids were ordered
by an individual.

30:05.666 --> 30:06.708
Is there a name?

30:07.458 --> 30:09.250
LAB TECH: Our head of security.

30:10.833 --> 30:12.125

30:19.750 --> 30:23.708
Check the cycles of security cameras
for any potential irregularities.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.208
Commissioner,
we have some questions for you.

30:28.291 --> 30:31.125
Sorry, I have to check
the data farm for anomalies.

30:31.208 --> 30:34.375
We know about the Nepenthé.
And the nano-droids.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.791
They didn't malfunction.

30:36.375 --> 30:39.000
You programmed them to disrupt and attack.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.500
You're coming with us.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.833
Everyone, freeze!

30:47.708 --> 30:49.458
If I trigger this failsafe,

30:49.541 --> 30:54.291
it will convert the planet's docile
workforce back into battle droids

30:54.375 --> 30:59.500
and unleash them
upon the unsuspecting citizens of Plazir!

31:00.458 --> 31:02.708
Don't make me do it.

There's no way out, Commissioner.

31:05.875 --> 31:06.916

COMMISSIONER HELGAIT: Give up?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.041
I never give up.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.250
I didn't give up to the corrupt Republic,

31:14.333 --> 31:19.750
I didn't give up to the Empire,
and I won't give up to you.

31:20.416 --> 31:21.500
You're a Separatist?

31:21.583 --> 31:24.208
Separatist is a pejorative term.

31:25.458 --> 31:27.875
I support democracy.

31:28.541 --> 31:31.500
Count Dooku was a visionary.

I'm afraid it is, M'Lady.
