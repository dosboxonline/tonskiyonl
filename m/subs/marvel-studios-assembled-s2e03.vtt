WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:04.170
FURY: There was an idea.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.464
(THUNDERCLAP)

00:06.548 --> 00:10.760
The idea was to bring together a group
of remarkable people

00:12.303 --> 00:14.305
to see if they could become
something more.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.727
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

00:18.810 --> 00:21.021
because I was playing
something even riskier.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.610
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.114
All the tech you could dream up.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.411
Here we all are, back on Earth...

00:37.328 --> 00:40.665
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.

00:43.293 --> 00:47.172
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.765
I was ten toes in this thing

00:57.348 --> 00:59.225
when you were still
singing nursery rhymes.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.435
(LAUGHS)

01:01.269 --> 01:02.645
I've been having conversations

01:02.729 --> 01:04.731
about a Nick Fury series
for a long time.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.525
So, when it came up or came about

01:07.609 --> 01:09.861
that they were going to do
Secret Invasion,

01:09.944 --> 01:11.237
I was chuffed about it

01:11.321 --> 01:15.408
and not knowing what the story was,
I had to go back and find

01:15.492 --> 01:18.745
that particular story line
in the comic books.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.206
This doesn't necessarily follow that,

01:21.289 --> 01:24.417
but once, you know,
we started dealing with the Skrulls

01:24.501 --> 01:27.128
and the Kree in Captain Marvel,

01:27.212 --> 01:30.381
that's when things started
to kind of bubble in that particular way.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.841
Don't kill me.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.010
That would really
complicate the situation

01:34.094 --> 01:36.596
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

01:36.679 --> 01:38.264
with some ugly-ass Skrull brain.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.974
TALOS: I'm sorry I simmed your boss,

01:40.058 --> 01:43.144
but now I stand before you
as my true self.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.687
Without deception.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.398
In Captain Marvel,
what we learn about the Skrulls

01:47.482 --> 01:50.860
is that they have been persecuted
by the Kree

01:50.944 --> 01:53.655
for many generations,
that their home world has been blown up

01:53.738 --> 01:57.909
and they are scattered across the cosmos
as refugees in search of a home planet.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.286
You're good to go here until you recover,

02:00.370 --> 02:02.664
but you and your family
are going to need a new look.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.415
I could go back to being your boss.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.542
Uh, please don't.

02:06.042 --> 02:09.254
It felt like there was more story there,
and what we sort of came to was,

02:09.337 --> 02:10.713
what if the end of Captain Marvel

02:10.797 --> 02:13.174
is Captain Marvel leading the Skrulls
into the galaxy

02:13.258 --> 02:14.509
to find a new home world?

02:14.592 --> 02:16.427
And what if she just failed?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.179
What if there was no new home world?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.640
And that felt like a starting point
for sort of the...

02:20.723 --> 02:23.768
The turning of trust
into anger and hatred.

02:24.310 --> 02:29.941
We've been helping you for all these years
to ensure that you kept your promise.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.318
But after The Blip,

02:33.903 --> 02:35.613
you were different.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.032
And then you disappeared.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.704
BRIAN TUCKER: Talos is a Skrull.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.582
Nick Fury is obviously a human,

02:45.665 --> 02:50.044
and he's tasked with preventing
this Skrull invasion.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.629
Can he trust his...

02:51.713 --> 02:53.882
One of his dearest friends
in that process?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.092
Can Talos trust Nick Fury?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.596
So trust and, you know,

02:59.679 --> 03:02.140
the flip side of that,
having faith in people,

03:02.223 --> 03:06.519
having faith in your friends,
even when it's very tough to do so

03:06.603 --> 03:08.855
is at the heart of the story.

03:08.938 --> 03:12.984
You've got nine minutes and counting
to figure out which side you're on!

03:15.028 --> 03:17.197
SCHWARTZ: We wanted to take Nick Fury

03:17.280 --> 03:20.575
and put him in a genre, in a structure
in which he would shine.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.161
And Nick doesn't have superpowers.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.456
His superpower is his brain
and his force of will.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.959
And those are things
that come through really well

03:30.043 --> 03:31.252
in a spy thriller.

03:32.045 --> 03:36.716
TUCKER: We talked about it being
a kind of a non-Marvel Marvel show.

03:36.799 --> 03:40.845
We wanted to really
dial into Fury, the man.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.807
You know, I may not know
when a Skrull is pretending to be a human,

03:45.433 --> 03:48.186
but I sure as hell know
when a human is lying.

03:48.853 --> 03:52.649
Whatever we think about
his trench coat and his eye patch,

03:52.732 --> 03:56.986
and how cool Sam Jackson is,
Nick Fury is a human,

03:57.070 --> 04:01.199
a human with a certain kind of power,
but not a superpower like Captain Marvel.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.117
Making friends with the locals?

04:03.201 --> 04:10.208
(CHUCKLES) How do you think
we kept the Cold War from going hot?

04:10.291 --> 04:11.918
I, as an individual,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.837
I'm sort of charismatic, I think.

04:14.921 --> 04:15.922
I can be fun.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.757
I can be intimidating.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.301
I can be all the things
that Nick Fury needs to be.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.596
His superpower is his persuasiveness

04:23.680 --> 04:25.181
and his fearlessness.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.684
I'm Nick Fury.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.562
Even when I'm out, I'm in.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.441
The thing that excites me
about this project, Secret Invasion,

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
is that you get to see
another side of him.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.030
TUCKER: He's gotten older
since we last saw him.

04:41.447 --> 04:47.453
He's been living up on S.A.B.E.R.,
his specially made space station.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.540
So he's been detached as well,

04:50.623 --> 04:53.626
and we wanted to show what it looked like

04:53.710 --> 04:56.170
for Fury a few years older,

04:56.254 --> 04:59.048
to come down and to have to re-acclimate.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.301
Let's just say I had a crisis of faith.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.053
So why'd you come back?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.555
It followed me up there,

05:07.056 --> 05:09.434
and I owe it to Talos.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.395
CLAIRE ANDERSON:
At the start of Episode 1,

05:12.478 --> 05:15.523
I think he arrives back on Earth
not sure quite what to expect,

05:15.606 --> 05:17.150
and what his role will be.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.528
And we wanted to use something
that made him look softer.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.281
We used a cut of tailoring in a coat

05:23.364 --> 05:27.327
that had a softer shoulder
to give him a more broken look.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.580
Although we kept elements
of Fury's original style,

05:30.663 --> 05:32.665
the collar is always popped.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.835
But using a wool meant that
it's more sympathetic to camera.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.795
Wool absorbs light differently to leather,

05:37.879 --> 05:40.882
so everything about him
was a bit less commanding.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.218
The gravitas of Nick's journey
is such that

05:44.302 --> 05:47.388
when we get towards
the penultimate episode,

05:47.472 --> 05:51.351
we need him to gather all his strength
and go forward to save the world

05:51.434 --> 05:52.894
and so that's what he does.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.480
And he moves from a dark, heavy coat

05:55.563 --> 05:57.857
to the black leather coat
and the eye patch,

05:57.940 --> 06:01.110
something that represents
the Fury of old that we know.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.406
So in working in Secret Invasion,

06:05.490 --> 06:10.036
we really wanted to bring back a lot
of our familiar faces within the MCU.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.872
Listen to me. I am here to help you.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.166
You know, I had to pinch myself
many mornings

06:15.249 --> 06:17.877
when I would step on set with Sam Jackson,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.837
Don Cheadle, Ben Mendelsohn.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.756
Some of my favorite actors in the world.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.050
How's that? You loved that, didn't ya?

06:24.133 --> 06:28.262
Ben, I got to know a little bit
when he was Talos in Captain Marvel.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.474
It was such a fun, cool,
amazing emotional character

06:31.557 --> 06:34.352
that it was a no-brainer
to bring him back for Secret Invasion.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.520
She's cheeky.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.022
Yeah, 'till she sees
an ugly-ass Skrull like you.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.607
Then she goes into hunting mode.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.485
I'm considered good-looking
amongst my kind there.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.613
BEN MENDELSOHN: In Captain Marvel,
the original brief

06:45.696 --> 06:49.158
was that Talos died in about Page 64.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.246
Once we started working,
the plan changed a little bit.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
Was it something I said?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.792
Once he was sticking around,

06:57.875 --> 07:00.545
there was a relationship
which developed with Fury.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.505
Go on, talk to her. She's your type.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.801
All right, if you're done.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.636
You always know just what to say.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.680
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

07:11.305 --> 07:12.849
JACKSON: He was a lot of fun.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.101
And he brings this really...

07:15.184 --> 07:17.979
He brings this verve
to this whole Skrull thing.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.189
Cut that. Let's reset. One more, please.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.483
One more? That was amazing.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.694
Again, again? You want it again? Cut.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.072
That was the best one.
That was the best ending. We got it.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.826
MENDELSOHN: It is one of the great
pleasures of my working life

07:31.909 --> 07:35.121
to have an onscreen banter relationship

07:35.204 --> 07:38.124
with a character
that's being played by Samuel L. Jackson.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.293
-I'm working with Sam Jackson.
-Break the window.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.379
-I'm working with Sam Jackson.
-MAN: So, A-cam, we lost video.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.547
(SINGS) Every day

07:47.675 --> 07:52.847
SMULDERS: I started my journey
with Marvel, gosh, probably a decade ago.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.891
It was on the first Avengers film.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.936
So I went in and read for "female agent."

07:59.437 --> 08:03.774
And I don't know
how I weaseled my way into this role,

08:03.858 --> 08:06.319
but I can't believe ten years later,

08:06.402 --> 08:09.071
you know, she's still
running around with Nick Fury.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.364
You gonna move?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.076
I haven't decided.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.871
See, that's what I'm worried about.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.832
The Fury I knew
was always three steps ahead.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.795
I was excited when I read the scripts

08:24.879 --> 08:27.590
that we got to see Maria
sort of more in action.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.802
-Drop the bags.
-I can't do that.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.554
You don't have a choice, sweetheart.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.306
We shot in here yesterday.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.641
It was a pretty quick fight

08:36.724 --> 08:39.936
(CHUCKLES) as we had to, to make it

08:40.019 --> 08:43.022
because Maria Hill is no match
for sweet Emilia Clarke.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.446
Where'd he go?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.572
She.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.408
Depending on how well you remember
the events of Captain Marvel,

08:54.492 --> 08:57.203
you may remember Talos
reconnecting with his daughter,

08:57.286 --> 08:59.080
who's been hidden from him for many years.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.208
That daughter, years later,
has become G'iah.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.293
Last warning!

09:06.337 --> 09:08.965
It's what you always say
but there's always another.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.091
G'iah.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.386
Working with Ben Mendelsohn
is the joy of my life.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.596
I was so nervous about meeting him

09:15.680 --> 09:18.182
because me and my friends
had a Ben Mendelsohn fan club.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.017
We're obsessed with him as an actor.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.437
There are certain actors
that are actors' actors to watch,

09:23.521 --> 09:26.482
and he is 100%, like,
top of the tree with that.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.859
I didn't know what to expect,
but what I got

09:28.943 --> 09:32.863
was this magical human
who just wants to play

09:32.947 --> 09:35.783
and is so intuitive and is so much fun.

09:35.992 --> 09:36.993
You know what?

09:37.076 --> 09:38.828
-It's all falling apart for me.
-(LAUGHS)

09:38.911 --> 09:41.956
-Let me just check out on this.
-They've always stopped coming.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.083
MENDELSOHN: You act with people,
you get a...

09:44.166 --> 09:45.835
You get an idea of who they are.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.045
It's not always right,
but you get an idea.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.215
And Emilia really blew me away.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.843
She's like fresh air.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.262
Just, you know, really knocked me over.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.556
-One and done.
-There aren't many of those here, mate.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.308
-I'm telling you that.
-It's beautiful.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.517
-No worries.
-Respect.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.311
With G'iah, throughout the show,

10:03.394 --> 10:06.647
you sort of see her go on a journey
of self-discovery as a woman,

10:06.731 --> 10:09.817
but also a journey of self-discovery
as a person.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.613
What her beliefs really are, are tested.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.448
And...

10:16.574 --> 10:18.034
She's a general's daughter,

10:18.117 --> 10:20.745
so there's a responsibility there.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.998
And it's the kind of question of
will she accept it or not?

10:24.373 --> 10:27.293
You don't see me because I'm not here.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.669
I understand you're taking a risk.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.754
A risk?

10:30.755 --> 10:34.216
Is that what you explained to Mum,
that following you could get her killed?

10:34.300 --> 10:39.305
Your mother died
while you were working for her killer.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.141
KINGSLEY BEN-ADIR:
With someone like Gravik,

10:42.224 --> 10:45.770
what was most interesting
about exploring him is that

10:45.853 --> 10:49.523
someone who has that impulse
towards violence and destruction,

10:49.607 --> 10:51.901
who also has such a high IQ

10:51.984 --> 10:53.444
is the most dangerous.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.866
GRAVIK: You know the difference
between statesmen and soldiers.

10:58.949 --> 11:02.244
One lot spends the war
posing for pictures,

11:03.454 --> 11:05.456
while the other does all the killing

11:05.539 --> 11:06.624
and the dying.

11:06.707 --> 11:11.796
Krell made his decision when he signed on
to your delusional war against the house.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.048
You know, I would be doing us both a favor

11:14.131 --> 11:15.758
if I just put you out of your misery.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.804
BEN-ADIR: For me, the key into that
was the destruction of his planet

11:19.887 --> 11:22.765
and then coming to Earth
and then trusting in Fury

11:22.848 --> 11:25.601
and then giving him 30 years
and still nothing.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.106
Enough's enough. Now I teach.
Now I'm the teacher.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.483
(SPEAKS SKRULL LANGUAGE)

11:49.709 --> 11:52.920
MENDELSOHN: Kingsley brings
an incredible energy

11:53.003 --> 11:59.844
and a real interrogation of who Gravik is
and why Gravik is,

11:59.927 --> 12:03.973
and he brings
a great amount of power to it.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.517
And he's very heartfelt.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.394
GRAVIK: You ask me, Talos,

12:08.477 --> 12:12.773
choice between having my story told
in ink and oil paint,

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
or having it written in blood.

12:15.484 --> 12:19.780
I choose blood all day long.

12:19.864 --> 12:26.162
There's a hurt that has calcified
into his madness and his rage,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.706
and I think he's playing
those things wonderfully.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.626
He's absolutely the Gravik
that I had in mind.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.545
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

12:34.628 --> 12:36.464
You're gonna take our people

12:36.547 --> 12:39.341
to the edge of extinction
with the war with the humans.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.343
All these miscreants know

12:42.678 --> 12:43.804
is murder.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.724
Look how they treat each other.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.602
That's what's gonna happen.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.062
We're gonna murder them all.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.403
SCHWARTZ: Secret Invasion takes place
in the real world and a real world.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.863
It's not alien planets.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.406
It's not starships far away.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.616
It's not other dimensions.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.493
It is Earth and Earth is the stakes.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.120
And that allows us to do a lot for real.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.080
Our production designer, Frank Walsh,

13:10.164 --> 13:12.958
has constructed
some amazing real world sets.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.337
I do like to have
very kind of tangible kind of sets

13:16.420 --> 13:18.464
that you feel you can see the dirt on.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.966
So you can touch something
that feels very real.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.677
I definitely wanted to kind of
create worlds in camera

13:23.761 --> 13:26.096
and not relying a lot on visual effects.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.308
The script was asking some amazing sets

13:29.391 --> 13:32.144
from the safe houses
in Moscow,

13:32.228 --> 13:35.523
which kind of harks back
to very kind of early thrillers, you know,

13:35.606 --> 13:37.942
up to reactor room in Skrull Town.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.946
So it was kind of a broad spectrum
of sets to design

13:42.029 --> 13:45.115
from very gritty places to very high end.

13:45.199 --> 13:49.578
But probably the biggest set piece
we will do is this Unity Day festival.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.040
We're in Piece Hall
in Halifax, West Yorkshire.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.545
We have recreated
a central square in Moscow

13:57.628 --> 14:00.339
that is celebrating Unity Day,

14:00.422 --> 14:04.760
which Gravik decided to attack or bomb

14:04.844 --> 14:07.513
during a time
when there are more people here.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.310
It's enormous. We had 250 extras.

14:13.394 --> 14:17.940
The square could probably
contain 5,000 people to make it look full.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.192
And so we used those 250

14:20.276 --> 14:21.819
and we tiled the floor with them,

14:21.902 --> 14:24.113
moved them around
in different configurations,

14:24.196 --> 14:27.783
so when we get a wide shot of the square,
it looks like it's really full

14:27.867 --> 14:29.743
like Times Square on New Year's Eve.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.497
There are explosions that go off

14:33.581 --> 14:36.375
and we've built,
thanks to John Van Der Pool,

14:36.458 --> 14:38.294
the special effects guy, we've built

14:38.794 --> 14:43.799
bombs that explode with air and fire
and throws debris out

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
so it looks like buildings are breaking.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.096
VAN DER POOL: This was a busy week for us.

14:49.179 --> 14:52.349
It's quite involved because
we're actually using compressed air,

14:52.433 --> 14:56.562
so as to keep the noise down with
a lot of very ancient windows around us

14:56.645 --> 14:58.063
and confined space.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.483
So we're using high pressure air mortars

15:01.567 --> 15:05.195
and we're using small explosives
linked with propane gas.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.657
We release propane gas
and then ignite it to give us a fireball.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.830
Bit more labor intensive,
but hopefully we'll get the right effect.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.251
I think we'll probably do
ten explosions over the weeks,

15:19.335 --> 15:22.254
especially with an effect like this
with so many variables,

15:22.338 --> 15:26.091
not just from our point of view
but from actors, from cameras,

15:26.175 --> 15:28.719
we're always prepared to do
more than one take.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.055
MAN: Three, two, one, action!

15:35.976 --> 15:37.937
Fury, Talos, what's your status?

15:39.563 --> 15:42.816
One of the kind of
just important decisions

15:42.900 --> 15:45.235
that we had to make early on

15:45.319 --> 15:49.239
was how to really illustrate the scale

15:49.323 --> 15:51.700
and the reality of the danger

15:51.784 --> 15:54.620
that Gravik and his rebels
pose to humans.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.625
And to do that, we couldn't allow

15:59.708 --> 16:03.545
all of our characters
to make it out safely.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.632
This is a contest for the planet.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.593
It's being fought on the ground
and it's gonna be bloody.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.846
There will be casualties in this conflict,

16:12.972 --> 16:17.184
and that means making, you know,
those tough decisions

16:17.267 --> 16:19.353
to say goodbye to beloved characters.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.856
FURY: Hill!

16:25.067 --> 16:26.860
-(GUN FIRES)
-(GROANS)

16:30.864 --> 16:33.450
It's a wrap. That's a wrap on...

16:33.867 --> 16:34.868
On this big day.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.664
We were out in the square
and there was multiple explosions

16:38.747 --> 16:42.584
and there was chaos and madness and...

16:42.668 --> 16:46.463
And in all of that,
Nick Fury was looking for Maria Hill,

16:46.547 --> 16:48.841
and Gravik got to her first

16:48.924 --> 16:52.928
and shape-shifted into the form of Fury
and shot Maria Hill,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.555
in the... In the gut.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.807
In the gut right there.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.103
(FURY GRUNTING)

17:01.186 --> 17:04.940
SMULDERS: I've enjoyed my time
with Sam immensely, and...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.317
And being his partner
in all these adventures

17:07.401 --> 17:09.111
and it's somewhat poetic

17:09.194 --> 17:12.823
that he's the one who I think
kills me, but isn't. It's...

17:12.906 --> 17:15.993
It's going to leave his character
in a very dark place.

17:17.786 --> 17:21.331
TUCKER: With the death of Maria Hill,
he now understands

17:21.415 --> 17:23.167
this is personal between him and Gravik.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.795
I think the real question is,
is Fury capable?

17:26.879 --> 17:29.840
Like, is Fury still Fury,

17:29.923 --> 17:31.258
or has he lost it?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.179
SONYA: I think Thanos's snap changed you.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.015
Taught you that no matter
how hard you fight for what's right,

17:38.098 --> 17:40.601
there's always someone stronger
to undermine you.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.279
SELIM: We are at Hatfield House
outside of London,

17:52.362 --> 17:55.657
and this is the location for

17:56.992 --> 18:00.621
the Russian townhouse of Sonya,

18:00.704 --> 18:04.541
who is the MI6 counterpart of Nick Fury.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.586
Back in the day, you would've seen
my rather mediocre bag men

18:07.669 --> 18:08.921
coming a mile away.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.340
The fact that you didn't see them coming

18:11.423 --> 18:14.134
means you sure as hell won't see
Gravik and his rebels coming.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.303
Which makes you as a partner
rather pointless.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.264
I don't need to say anything
about Olivia Colman as an actor

18:19.348 --> 18:21.016
because everybody already knows.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.435
She's one of the greatest
living actors in the world

18:23.519 --> 18:26.021
who brings a sense of fun and adventure,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
and this amazing spirit
to everything she does.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.316
Alone at last.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.027
Now, shall we do this
the easy way or the other way?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.364
I know after every Marvel film released,

18:35.447 --> 18:39.868
I would phone my agent and say,
"Please, can I be in a Marvel?"

18:40.285 --> 18:42.454
But I don't know
if that actually is how it happened,

18:42.538 --> 18:44.790
but I got a call and said, "Yes."

18:44.873 --> 18:48.335
JACKSON: I just really, really,
really love working with her after...

18:48.418 --> 18:50.754
after watching her
in so many wonderful things

18:50.838 --> 18:53.257
and knowing what kind of actor she was.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.509
COLMAN: I was so excited and so nervous.

18:55.592 --> 18:59.054
Like proper kneecap jelly
when I knew I was going to meet him.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.806
And he was just so lovely.

19:00.889 --> 19:04.268
I think we might have even both gone
(LAUGHS) when we met.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.103
-Ooh!
-JACKSON: That was amazing!

19:06.562 --> 19:08.480
He called my sneakers dope.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.650
I don't think I took them off for a year.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.027
JACKSON: It's one of those things
where I've always known,

19:14.111 --> 19:16.321
you know, from watching her

19:16.405 --> 19:20.033
that as serious and as convincing

19:20.117 --> 19:23.370
and as honest
as her work is when you see it,

19:24.079 --> 19:26.874
you can see the twinkle in her eye
that's fun.

19:26.957 --> 19:31.336
She is a very fun, fun actor

19:31.420 --> 19:34.965
that, you know, like me,
this is sort of a playground for her.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.844
She wants to come to work
and do this thing that we do.

19:38.927 --> 19:43.265
And the better you are at it,
the better she becomes at it,

19:43.348 --> 19:46.393
and the more you engage with her,

19:46.476 --> 19:49.855
the more, you know, we give each other
and the scenes become even fuller.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.857
Well, they do say Darwin never sleeps.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.403
-Let's give our extinction a nice leg up.
-(CHUCKLES)

19:57.029 --> 19:59.698
SCHWARTZ: While Nick is relatively
sympathetic to the Skrulls

19:59.781 --> 20:01.742
and has been working with them
for a long time,

20:02.159 --> 20:03.368
Sonya is not,

20:03.452 --> 20:06.538
and will go scorched-earth
in order to protect Britain and the world.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.917
I've thrown everything at him
and he hasn't said a word.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.002
What makes you think
you can get him to speak?

20:12.085 --> 20:13.629
Oh, I can be quite persuasive.

20:14.129 --> 20:19.676
COLMAN: So, today, we've been shooting
a scene where Sonya is torturing Brogan

20:19.760 --> 20:22.387
because he's a Skrull

20:23.222 --> 20:27.059
and there's some good ones, some bad ones,
and she likes to find out who's who.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.603
-So she chops off his finger.
-(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

20:29.686 --> 20:32.147
We watch the human finger
turn to Skrull so she knows,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.483
"Okay, he's one of them." And then,

20:34.566 --> 20:37.653
tortures him with this injection,
which makes his blood cook.

20:38.528 --> 20:43.533
And then she kicks him over off his chair
so that she can get to the escape hatch.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.577
Sounds like your lift is here.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.624
So I had to kick Brogan over
off his chair,

20:50.707 --> 20:53.168
and I'm quite ashamed
at how much I enjoyed it.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.380
-I really enjoyed it.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

20:56.463 --> 20:59.508
But it's just so exciting to come on set,
on a Marvel set,

21:00.259 --> 21:03.178
and there's gadgets and torture things

21:03.262 --> 21:07.432
and liquids that make people bubble.
Oh, I love it. It's really fun.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.101
What'd you tell 'em?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.061
Nothin', just lies.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.437
Nothin'?

21:12.813 --> 21:13.897
Just lies?

21:14.523 --> 21:15.941
That's all, I swear.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.530
SELIM: Gravik has come up with
a version of the classic chaos theory,

21:21.613 --> 21:23.865
which comes from many types of warfare,

21:23.949 --> 21:25.575
specifically, Skrull warfare,

21:25.659 --> 21:28.787
where you get your enemies
to fight against each other

21:28.870 --> 21:31.790
and reduce their numbers
so that then you can come in

21:31.873 --> 21:33.625
and either finish them off

21:34.251 --> 21:36.211
or just turn them into refugees
and take over.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.338
You've got all these European crybabies.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.841
They're all saying
we had something to do with Moscow.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.759
Well, I call bull on that.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.177
I see no evidence.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.264
There's no way the Moscow attacks
were committed by Americans.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.016
What are you hearing, Senator Byers?

21:49.099 --> 21:53.270
For us to feel like
we could reasonably and believably,

21:53.353 --> 21:55.939
explore this idea of sowing world chaos,

21:56.023 --> 22:00.485
we really felt that the rebel Skrulls
had to infiltrate on a global capacity.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.530
That means infiltrating
different countries,

22:03.613 --> 22:06.158
governments, businesses, communities.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.453
Colonel, are you denying
that two of your citizens,

22:09.536 --> 22:12.998
Mr. Nicholas Fury and Miss Maria Hill,

22:13.081 --> 22:16.543
were present in Moscow
at the scene of the attacks?

22:16.626 --> 22:20.172
We are aware of allegations
that Mr. Fury and Miss Hill

22:20.255 --> 22:22.007
may have traveled to Moscow.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.802
TUCKER: Another example
of trust no one in our show

22:25.886 --> 22:30.432
that has kind of far-reaching
implications for the MCU,

22:30.515 --> 22:34.436
looking backward and projecting forward,
is that we find out that

22:34.519 --> 22:36.688
Colonel Rhodes is, in fact, a Skrull.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.193
It's been an interesting ride,

22:41.276 --> 22:44.863
and through all of the different
iterations of Rhodey,

22:44.946 --> 22:47.991
and it's great to have an opportunity
to keep exploring a character

22:48.075 --> 22:50.327
and finding new facets to him

22:50.410 --> 22:51.912
and new ways to play it.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.081
If Slovakia rolls its eyes at me
one more time,

22:54.164 --> 22:56.208
I'm gonna put on the suit
and carpet bomb it.

22:56.291 --> 22:59.920
I think that's always the exciting thing
to me about these shows is...

23:00.003 --> 23:01.922
Is seeing the other colors
of these characters

23:02.005 --> 23:03.924
and what they're having to deal with.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.803
While the country appreciates your service
to the President tonight,

23:07.886 --> 23:09.346
I'm here now. You can go.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.390
You must be outta your Skrull-ass mind,

23:11.473 --> 23:14.434
you think I'm gonna let you
get anywhere near the President.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.978
Don and I were like golf buddies,

23:17.062 --> 23:20.774
and we've known each other forever
but never worked together.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.818
-Enticing offer.
-Word.

23:23.735 --> 23:27.030
I would think that's what they call
in this business a win-win.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.199
Can I make you a counteroffer?

23:30.492 --> 23:35.539
JACKSON: So, this has been, you know,
a wonderful opportunity for Don and I

23:35.622 --> 23:38.291
to, you know, step in
and do some stuff together

23:38.375 --> 23:41.837
and be able to, I'd say, joust

23:41.920 --> 23:46.007
in that way that good friends
who respect each other's work

23:46.091 --> 23:50.303
and have been anxious to actually,
you know, get in that space together

23:51.179 --> 23:52.264
and do it.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.057
This is a war I got to fight.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.978
When we finish, we can look at each other
and kind of go,

23:58.061 --> 24:01.314
"Yeah, I think we did it.
Yeah, we did it. We did it. Yeah."

24:12.993 --> 24:17.289
TUCKER: One of the special reveals
that we thought was important

24:17.372 --> 24:20.459
in building out this series
and building out a Nick Fury

24:20.542 --> 24:22.711
who was fuller than just his job

24:22.794 --> 24:24.588
is Mrs. Fury.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.299
-Good morning.
-Morning!

24:27.382 --> 24:29.259
TUCKER: Her name's Priscilla Davis

24:29.342 --> 24:31.178
and they met 30 years ago.

24:31.261 --> 24:35.140
There's a rule that, you know, commander
of station and operatives cannot be...

24:35.223 --> 24:37.517
Our unit doesn't exist, Fury.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.353
That means I don't work for you.

24:40.770 --> 24:44.191
-That's an intriguing possibility.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:44.399 --> 24:49.738
TUCKER: And what we further reveal
is that Priscilla's, in fact, a Skrull.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.781
WILLIAMS: She's very much a peer to Fury,

24:51.865 --> 24:54.117
which is something
we don't see often in the MCU.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.869
He's the smartest guy in the room,

24:55.952 --> 24:58.330
and with Priscilla we had somebody
who could match his wit

24:58.413 --> 25:01.708
and his intelligence,
and that was really exciting.

25:02.459 --> 25:06.546
Charlayne Woodard, a friend of mine
that I've known for a very long time

25:06.630 --> 25:08.173
back in the '70s and '80s,

25:08.256 --> 25:10.759
when all of us were, you know,
pounding the pavement

25:11.259 --> 25:13.303
and doing plays
and doing all this other stuff.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.430
She's, you know, fascinating to work with.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.517
I never had a chance to work with her.
We've just been friends forever.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.685
So all of a sudden,
we're working together,

25:20.769 --> 25:22.646
so that's an amazing kind of thing.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.816
-Fancy.
-My old Moroccan pour.

25:27.609 --> 25:30.362
I thought she was something really special

25:30.445 --> 25:33.114
and she knew how to have fun with it.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.993
Thank you for the best time
I've ever had on any project.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.620
-MAN: Yeah.
-Why lie to them? (CHUCKLES)

25:38.703 --> 25:39.996
It's the truth.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.707
If it was Gravik,
then why does he need me?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.335
What Gravik needs,
what Gravik doesn't need,

25:45.418 --> 25:46.711
that's none of your concern.

25:47.462 --> 25:51.007
Gravik is, depending on your perspective,

25:51.132 --> 25:56.680
either a global terrorist
or, you know, a freedom fighter.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.933
BEN-ADIR: Gravik doesn't trust anyone
apart from himself.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.810
Skrulls, humans, they're all the same.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.895
I see you've kept the circle tight
on this one.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.815
-We're the circle. No one else.
-Oh, yeah?

26:06.898 --> 26:09.025
We're over 500 strong now.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.486
BETO: So, is everyone a part of...

26:11.570 --> 26:14.281
G'IAH: The resistance? No.
Gravik provides refuge.

26:14.739 --> 26:17.784
But if you do choose to be a warrior,
there is one advantage.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.452
Oh, yeah? What's that?

26:19.703 --> 26:20.912
You get to leave.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.998
Everyone else stays in the compound.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.712
SELIM: The idea was to have a place
where the Skrulls could survive

26:28.795 --> 26:30.505
and the humans couldn't get to.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.923
So it was like a hideout,

26:32.007 --> 26:35.635
like a refugee camp that was undetectable.

26:36.136 --> 26:41.099
And the Skrulls realized, or knew,
before the story started

26:41.182 --> 26:43.268
that they could withstand radiation.

26:44.185 --> 26:48.023
And there's a town
very much like Chernobyl

26:48.106 --> 26:53.403
that has been the victim of a nuclear
power plant meltdown some years before,

26:53.486 --> 26:57.907
and the humans stay away from it
because the radiation levels are too high.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.535
And the Skrulls, it has no effect on them.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.288
WALSH: I always imagine
it was like 20 years adrift,

27:03.371 --> 27:05.415
that it had been abandoned
at least 20 years.

27:05.498 --> 27:09.169
The buildings there probably date
from maybe 50 years ago?

27:09.252 --> 27:12.047
So I was trying to create
that sort of sense of a place

27:12.130 --> 27:13.715
where it has a history.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.426
It looks derelict in a way
that people have abandoned it.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.554
It needed to feel that
it was kind of natural, degraded,

27:19.638 --> 27:22.098
you know, the way that
nature takes over places.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.560
The Skrulls are not
trying to make it home,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.813
so they're never fixing anything up.
They're just existing there

27:28.897 --> 27:31.775
because this is just
a stopping off place in their journey.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.235
The Skrull experience
is a refugee experience.

27:34.319 --> 27:38.281
It's an experience that has required them
to live in the shadows,

27:38.365 --> 27:40.909
and they want nothing more

27:40.992 --> 27:44.037
than to continue
to be able to live in peace.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.706
Welcome to New Skrullos.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.379
ANDERSON: I looked back
at the Secret Invasion comic,

27:52.462 --> 27:55.924
I looked at Captain Marvel
where we see the Skrulls,

27:56.007 --> 27:58.760
I dug into Marvel Archive
to see if there was anything else.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.304
We explored the Skrull language.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.014
We got Skrull text.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.392
We explored all of those elements,

28:05.475 --> 28:07.602
and what we decided was

28:07.686 --> 28:13.858
the Skrulls will have kept an element
of who they were about themselves.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.362
So, we wanted to find a texture
that represented their skin.

28:17.445 --> 28:21.366
So we have given all the Skrulls
a waffle texture as a base layer,

28:21.491 --> 28:23.660
because that felt close to their skin.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.370
Now, the more military Skrulls

28:25.453 --> 28:28.998
have got map pockets and military pockets,

28:29.499 --> 28:31.584
I think, pockets for equipment

28:31.668 --> 28:34.003
because as they assimilate to humans,

28:34.087 --> 28:36.881
they gather information
about what's useful

28:36.965 --> 28:38.299
and what the human does.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.718
So in a military sense,

28:39.801 --> 28:43.722
they adapted aspects
of military clothing and militia look.

28:43.805 --> 28:48.977
And then the more civilian Skrulls
that we see in Skrull Town

28:49.060 --> 28:52.856
are more, more utilitarianly dressed,

28:52.939 --> 28:54.858
and we looked at French work wear,
we looked

28:54.941 --> 28:59.446
at what uniform does society
give its civilians

28:59.529 --> 29:02.157
when they're in a politically
transient situation.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.533
What is your name?

29:03.616 --> 29:04.701
BROGAN: Warrior.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.244
What is your fight?

29:06.327 --> 29:07.328
BROGAN: Skrullos.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.872
PAGON: What is your dream?

29:08.955 --> 29:09.956
BROGAN: Home.

29:10.457 --> 29:14.544
When we came to designing the makeup
for the Skrull refugees,

29:14.627 --> 29:17.881
we were talking about the reality of that

29:17.964 --> 29:22.260
and how we were going to reflect that
with our cast and our Skrulls.

29:22.343 --> 29:28.057
And, you know, they've all got to look,
like, downtrodden and tired

29:28.141 --> 29:30.310
and world-weary.

29:30.393 --> 29:34.355
You may not notice,
but they've all got quite grubby nails

29:34.439 --> 29:36.775
and the necks are all a bit grubby,

29:36.858 --> 29:40.361
and the pores on the...
Across the noses of the children

29:40.445 --> 29:43.281
have got worn in dirt,
little details like that

29:43.364 --> 29:48.077
which just bring that kind of reality
of being constantly on the move.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.924
We're now in the finishing
department of Cam Effects.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.218
This is where we do
all the painting and the seaming

30:03.301 --> 30:05.929
and getting things all ready
just before things go on set.

30:06.012 --> 30:09.808
This is kind of the final stage
before we take the prosthetics on the set

30:09.891 --> 30:11.392
and stick them onto the actor.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.608
Some prosthetics
we actually have done the ears separate.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.569
So the ears would go on first,
then the chin, then the face.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.281
In some cowls, we've done the ears intact.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.535
The reason that we've done them
slightly different for different people

30:28.618 --> 30:31.204
is because some people's ears
are so close to their head

30:31.287 --> 30:34.666
that actually, we can get away
with keeping the ears on the cowl

30:34.749 --> 30:36.709
and some they stick out,

30:36.793 --> 30:39.254
so it's actually easier for us
to do the ears separately.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.005
It just depends on time as well.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.341
The good thing about doing it this way is

30:43.424 --> 30:45.927
the time in the makeup chair
is vastly reduced

30:46.010 --> 30:49.639
because we can stick on this large piece
in probably about 40 minutes

30:49.722 --> 30:51.975
and then that's half the makeup
pretty much done,

30:52.058 --> 30:53.643
and then chin and face goes on

30:53.726 --> 30:55.103
and it's very, very fast.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.942
We have a lot of background Skrulls.

31:01.025 --> 31:04.404
The difference between the cast
and the background is actually minimal.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.114
You know, the actual level of detail

31:06.197 --> 31:08.199
and the application
is pretty much the same.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.452
But the very background
is literally pull-on masks,

31:11.536 --> 31:14.414
and that's to save on time and labor,

31:14.497 --> 31:18.835
and you know, each Skrull actually
has two prosthetic makeup artists on.

31:19.335 --> 31:22.755
So as soon as you have 20 Skrulls on set,
which they will be in makeup,

31:22.839 --> 31:25.133
you know,
that's 40 prosthetic makeup artists.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.010
And then we want
another 15 people in masks,

31:27.093 --> 31:29.721
so we want to minimize that crew.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.181
One of the longest things
that we have to deal with

31:32.265 --> 31:33.266
is painting hands.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.018
So you do these... These Skrull makeups,

31:35.101 --> 31:38.229
but it takes an hour to paint the arms
up to here and put all the detail in

31:38.313 --> 31:40.148
and sometimes back-of-hand prosthetics.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.774
So we've actually avoided that

31:41.858 --> 31:45.486
with basically producing
our Lycra pull-on Skrull gloves,

31:45.612 --> 31:46.821
and then it's... It's done.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.365
You know, you've got a Skrull hand
very, very quickly,

31:49.449 --> 31:51.868
and it means that
they can take the mask off,

31:51.951 --> 31:54.037
they can take the gloves off,
have their lunch.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.580
Talos is the only character

31:55.663 --> 31:58.917
that we haven't sculpted
bespoke ourselves.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.003
This is the character
that is transferring from Captain Marvel.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.423
Ben Mendelsohn's makeup hasn't changed.
Everything still fits okay.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.677
Prosthetics. They do a couple of things.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.138
They tend to make you
better-looking in some ways.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.807
They'll tend to improve
upon the shape of your head.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.102
They take a very long time.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.773
But there's a golden rule, I think.

32:22.815 --> 32:25.902
There's not...
There's nothing to be gained from...

32:28.863 --> 32:33.409
From, you know, bitching about
being inside the costume

32:33.493 --> 32:36.371
or complaining about its difficulties.

32:36.454 --> 32:38.998
You got to suck it up, roll with it

32:39.082 --> 32:43.127
and work inside a superhero
prosthetics and the costumes.

32:44.587 --> 32:47.423
Did you feel that sort of scrolling pain?
Right, look...

32:51.427 --> 32:56.307
SELIM: We are at Dunsfold,
which is a decommissioned air base

32:56.391 --> 32:58.559
that's used for Top Gear.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.813
Top Gear is filmed here,
and so people are very excited about that.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.899
And we're shooting
the presidential motorcade ambush

33:04.983 --> 33:07.193
at the end of Episode 4.

33:07.276 --> 33:12.198
This scene has been
in development for months,

33:12.281 --> 33:13.700
working closely with Rob Inch,

33:13.783 --> 33:16.035
the stunt coordinator
and second unit director,

33:16.119 --> 33:19.038
who is really the hero of this sequence,

33:19.122 --> 33:23.042
which I think will end up being
seven or eight minutes of screentime.

33:23.626 --> 33:26.087
And he's been working on it full-time

33:26.963 --> 33:31.217
since probably May,
and it's now middle of November.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.432
I work with a storyboard artist,
develop the shots, show them to Rob.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.683
Rob develops,

33:39.142 --> 33:41.019
sort of reverse engineers

33:41.102 --> 33:44.147
how to create the car flip
that's been drawn,

33:44.230 --> 33:49.569
then the storyboards go into
an animation sequence called pre-vis

33:49.652 --> 33:52.113
where we pre-visualize
what's going to happen.

33:52.196 --> 33:55.199
The pre-vis people work,
then the editor takes over,

33:55.283 --> 33:58.828
edits together the storyboards
and the pre-vis animation

33:58.911 --> 34:02.707
and ultimately comes up
with a sequence that is paced and timed

34:02.790 --> 34:04.292
as the final sequence will be.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.920
And that gives Rob Inch and myself
a greater sense of

34:08.004 --> 34:10.798
how long the car flips need to take
and how to achieve them.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.551
And we come here to Dunsfold

34:13.634 --> 34:17.263
and Rob basically works
with the mechanics of all that

34:17.346 --> 34:20.141
and any time you see an actor's face

34:20.224 --> 34:23.394
emoting or delivering some information,

34:23.478 --> 34:24.562
that's my job.

34:24.645 --> 34:27.106
So, I'm the main unit,
he's the second unit

34:27.190 --> 34:29.525
and we come together in this week

34:29.609 --> 34:31.235
to put together this sequence.

34:31.319 --> 34:36.365
Ready, and three, two, one, action!

34:38.910 --> 34:40.078
Cut that!

34:40.161 --> 34:43.539
So there's loads of elements to this.
First of all, the...

34:43.623 --> 34:45.583
You know, we're doing two-car flip

34:45.666 --> 34:48.002
and with one of the cars,
ultimately, what we do is

34:48.086 --> 34:49.545
we're gonna do a cannon roll,

34:50.088 --> 34:54.342
which is a charged cannon
in the bottom of the car

34:54.425 --> 34:56.969
that throws out a piston which flips it

34:57.053 --> 35:00.389
and as that happens,
we have the presidential car behind that,

35:00.473 --> 35:02.892
swerves out of the way of that one
and he gets hit

35:02.975 --> 35:06.521
and we're going to do
a more conventional pipe ramp with that

35:06.604 --> 35:08.564
which will roll that car over

35:08.648 --> 35:12.902
and disengage the two cars
from the presidential cavalcade.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.906
We got hold of a couple of old cars,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.575
put roll cages in them

35:19.659 --> 35:23.204
and went to Dunsfold and tested it
where we were going to film it.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.206
How's the distance, for this to go under?

35:25.289 --> 35:26.833
It looks... It looks pretty good.

35:26.916 --> 35:27.917
-Okay, good.
-Yeah.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.795
VAN DER POOL: There's several stages
before we actually get to do it.

35:30.878 --> 35:34.048
Certainly, each time we do it,
it's a completely new car,

35:34.632 --> 35:37.927
and they're quite expensive,
those Suburbans, so... (CHUCKLES)

35:38.636 --> 35:40.805
We didn't have too many to play with.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.394
The attack really happens then.
We've got three vans

35:46.477 --> 35:48.104
coming from up in the woods here.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.939
We're doing a jump through some hedge

35:50.022 --> 35:53.109
to introduce the kind of Russian baddies

35:53.192 --> 35:55.361
and then the gun battle happens,

35:55.444 --> 35:58.489
and through that gun battle,
we take down a couple of helicopters.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.993
They land left and right
of the presidential car that's flipped up.

36:02.076 --> 36:05.329
We're going to be ratcheting a couple
people away from that as that happens.

36:05.413 --> 36:09.417
But then the story is a navigation
of getting Fury and Talos

36:09.500 --> 36:12.378
back to where the president is to...

36:12.461 --> 36:14.463
To break open the window, pull him out,

36:14.547 --> 36:16.174
and take him away.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.260
(GROANS)

36:23.306 --> 36:25.474
He's a bloody alien.
He's trying to get to Ritson!

36:25.558 --> 36:28.227
No, no, no! Hold your fire!
He's with me!

36:29.896 --> 36:32.732
The president cannot be got.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.066
He can't be got.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.361
If the president gets got, it's game over.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.407
So, Talos does the only thing that he...

36:41.490 --> 36:44.577
That he can.
He's trying to get him out of that car.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.787
Talos, hang in there.
I'll be back for you.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.916
And you know, it's a...
It's a great move by Gravik.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.920
Put him down.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.800
I said put him down.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.435
TUCKER: I think Nick Fury is aware

37:09.518 --> 37:13.397
that his personal attachments
to other people,

37:13.481 --> 37:17.568
other Skrulls opens him up
to what's at stake.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.321
Not just for humans here on Earth,

37:20.404 --> 37:23.866
but for Skrulls here on Earth,
that they do share the same values

37:24.367 --> 37:28.621
and that Talos has just paid
the ultimate price to demonstrate that.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.541
MENDELSOHN:
It's the Obi-Wan Kenobi thing.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.127
He is more powerful as an example

37:35.211 --> 37:39.048
when he's gone
than I think he would be capable

37:39.674 --> 37:41.259
of living at that time.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.135
SELIM: On a surface level,
the fact that

37:43.219 --> 37:46.973
Nick Fury has lost Maria Hill
and lost Talos,

37:47.056 --> 37:49.600
both at the hands of Gravik,

37:49.684 --> 37:53.104
I think, is just a further extension

37:53.187 --> 37:57.650
of Gravik sinking the knife
and twisting it into Nick Fury.

37:57.733 --> 38:01.696
But I also think it's good to take
a character who has a lot of questions

38:02.196 --> 38:06.200
and needs to make a lot of decisions
and isolate them

38:06.284 --> 38:11.205
so that the pressure
becomes entirely on them

38:11.289 --> 38:15.042
and they are unable
to point fingers anywhere.

38:15.543 --> 38:21.090
Nearly every Avenger
spilled blood in the Battle of Earth.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.634
Even Carol Danvers.

38:25.136 --> 38:29.682
In the aftermath,
some were sent in to collect that DNA.

38:32.018 --> 38:35.354
Some with the ability to blend in.

38:37.315 --> 38:41.527
Nobody knew about them
but me and the collectors,

38:41.986 --> 38:43.279
-led by...
-Gravik.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.572
Gravik, yes.

38:44.655 --> 38:48.617
Which is probably where he got the idea
for the Super Skrull machine.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.746
-So you are responsible for all this?
-Yeah.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.541
Why do you think I came back?

38:58.919 --> 39:03.174
We're developing this process
of injecting ourselves with the DNA of,

39:04.216 --> 39:07.803
you know, other characters,
very powerful characters from the MCU.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.098
It's all going towards the machine,

39:11.182 --> 39:15.644
which is the creation of this machine
which is right behind us,

39:15.728 --> 39:17.480
which you go into and...

39:18.147 --> 39:20.733
It's kind of like a pick-and-mix.
You can choose...

39:21.442 --> 39:25.529
I'll take the DNA of Abomination
or Cull Obsidian, or whoever,

39:25.613 --> 39:27.365
and then you take on their powers.

39:29.283 --> 39:31.660
It's all leading towards basically turning

39:32.203 --> 39:34.080
the minimal Skrull population

39:34.580 --> 39:37.500
into a force of super soldiers.

39:41.128 --> 39:46.384
It was an ongoing conversation throughout
pre-production and even into production,

39:46.467 --> 39:48.052
about which characters,

39:48.135 --> 39:51.764
which superpowered beings
we would pull from for this DNA.

39:55.309 --> 39:58.354
You want to feel that
the strength and the DNA they collect

39:58.437 --> 40:01.440
is powerful enough
to make them a compelling

40:01.524 --> 40:04.360
and interesting and scary villain.

40:04.443 --> 40:09.365
So, we began our search with this hunt
over Planet Earth and we're like,

40:09.448 --> 40:12.159
"Where could they have found
Frost Giant DNA?

40:12.243 --> 40:15.287
"Where could they have found EXTREMIS DNA,
or Groot DNA?"

40:15.371 --> 40:18.999
And so, we started to search
through the movies and they're like, "Ha!"

40:19.083 --> 40:20.835
They found Groot DNA

40:20.918 --> 40:24.505
at the site in Wakanda
where Groot put his arms into the ground

40:24.588 --> 40:25.714
to try to defeat Thanos.

40:25.798 --> 40:29.844
Cull Obsidian's arm gets chopped off
in one of the battles in New York.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.513
So, it was... It was really fun to, like,

40:32.596 --> 40:35.433
pick these, like, seemingly random strands

40:35.516 --> 40:38.436
out of the MCU
and find a new place for them

40:38.519 --> 40:40.438
within the context of Secret Invasion.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.065
And we no longer just change faces.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.317
We change powers.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.738
We're gonna be uniquely programmed
weapons of mass destruction.

40:50.823 --> 40:51.866
All of us.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.618
Super Skrulls.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.997
SELIM: Gravik realizes that
he needs to be stronger.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.623
He needs bigger weapons,

40:59.707 --> 41:03.210
and the biggest weapon
you can have is Avenger DNA

41:03.294 --> 41:05.546
and become Carol Danvers.

41:07.840 --> 41:12.303
Carol's DNA
represents the highest of the high

41:12.386 --> 41:15.014
in terms of the powers,
even more than the Avengers, I think.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.558
Once he gets
Captain Marvel's powers,

41:17.641 --> 41:20.811
everyone will then
be able to experience his pain

41:20.895 --> 41:25.274
and absolute destruction and chaos
or cleanse or whatever you want to call it

41:25.357 --> 41:26.984
will be inevitable.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.529
It's part of what I...

41:30.613 --> 41:32.490
I know it's a part of his mind game,

41:32.573 --> 41:34.867
but what part of a mind game is it?

41:34.950 --> 41:36.118
It's, um...

41:37.036 --> 41:38.245
I think this...

41:38.787 --> 41:40.873
This entire thing is a tribunal.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.585
To put you on trial, put Nick Fury,

41:45.294 --> 41:47.421
the man that made this promise,

41:47.505 --> 41:49.340
the guy who sacrificed

41:50.716 --> 41:52.635
his life, his relationships...

41:52.718 --> 41:54.553
Things he should have done,
but he never did.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.931
All the relationships he's had
have been tainted by it.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.516
Everything you've touched.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.643
-His commitment to something else.
-Right.

42:00.726 --> 42:04.104
-...you've tainted in his estimation...
-Yeah.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.398
...put you on trial for that.

42:08.108 --> 42:10.110
(COUGHS)

42:10.236 --> 42:13.572
What we're sitting in at the moment
is the core of the reactor control room.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.116
The assumption
is there's still power here,

42:16.200 --> 42:19.495
that the Skrulls are using this as
a power source for their own experiments.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.541
I was in Budapest last year

42:23.624 --> 42:26.544
and visited this power station
this is based on

42:26.627 --> 42:28.879
and just thought, "What an amazing space."

42:28.963 --> 42:30.381
It was an Art Deco,

42:30.464 --> 42:33.259
it's period
and there is a pattern in here.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.844
You've got an oval space
with a sphere inside it.

42:35.928 --> 42:39.056
But I just thought the idea of it
being an eye in some way was interesting.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.850
What is so interesting about the Skrulls

42:41.934 --> 42:44.645
is that they have
this shape-shifting trick they do

42:44.728 --> 42:46.146
that fools the eye,

42:46.230 --> 42:48.232
and what you see and what you don't see

42:48.315 --> 42:50.067
is a constant theme all the way through,

42:50.150 --> 42:53.362
and it's something
I have kind of exploited in subtle ways.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.365
I was interested in reflections,
I was interested in mirrors,

42:56.490 --> 42:58.200
and sometimes you look into spaces

42:58.284 --> 43:00.703
and you see something
but it's not really there.

43:00.786 --> 43:03.080
The Skrulls are like magpies.
They take stuff away

43:03.163 --> 43:05.457
from what they find around
and make their own things.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.460
So I just thought
it was kind of great foil

43:08.544 --> 43:11.255
to have redundant technology
and future technology

43:11.338 --> 43:12.506
existing in the same place.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.010
So I pitched it and I don't know,
they seemed to like it. (CHUCKLES)

43:20.723 --> 43:22.975
Whoa! Colonel Rhodes, I've got you.

43:26.270 --> 43:29.023
You've been held hostage
for a long time.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.107
(GROANS)

43:34.111 --> 43:38.741
CHEADLE: One of the big themes in the show
is the theme of the other and...

43:38.824 --> 43:40.200
And feeling

43:40.951 --> 43:43.704
like you don't have a place that you...
That you don't belong.

43:43.787 --> 43:48.500
And that gives us a feeling of what we are
dealing with day-to-day in this world.

43:49.293 --> 43:52.796
This happens every once in a while
where, you know, writers write a show,

43:52.880 --> 43:56.133
and by the time it comes out,
it's the life we're living.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.807
It's dealing with
some very real human issues

44:03.932 --> 44:06.143
and very real human struggles

44:06.226 --> 44:08.771
and to give that air time,
to give that space,

44:08.854 --> 44:10.898
I think it's remarkable,

44:11.398 --> 44:14.026
and I feel utterly privileged
to be a part of that conversation.

44:15.069 --> 44:19.823
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.076
As I am.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.421
Only as you are.

44:47.726 --> 44:50.104
-Oh, Lord.
-(CHUCKLES)

44:50.187 --> 44:51.188
Well.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.069
Yeah. I'm gonna miss this one.
I'm gonna miss it a lot.

44:59.363 --> 45:02.574
I will miss the degree
to which this is in people's hearts.

45:02.658 --> 45:06.662
I'm gonna miss a lot of the people
that the audience don't see

45:06.745 --> 45:10.541
who make up the real experience
of what it is to do this...

45:10.624 --> 45:13.085
These things.
The people I work with every day,

45:13.168 --> 45:15.671
and I'm going to miss
being on set with Sam.

45:17.589 --> 45:21.260
JACKSON: I've been fortunate
from the first time I showed up.

45:21.343 --> 45:23.095
I was making sure they didn't kill me.

45:23.178 --> 45:25.723
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.934
So I could be the next one
and the next one

45:29.017 --> 45:31.562
and I kind of keep doing that in this,

45:31.645 --> 45:34.189
hoping, "Well, okay,
are they gonna kill me this time?

45:34.273 --> 45:35.774
"They ain't kill me yet.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.985
"Are they gonna kill me
in the series now?"

45:38.485 --> 45:40.946
But that's another story for another time.

45:41.697 --> 45:45.534
I think the luxury of doing a series
within the Marvel Universe

45:45.617 --> 45:47.119
is you get to spend time.

45:47.661 --> 45:50.914
We get to jump into Nick Fury's world

45:50.998 --> 45:52.499
which is very Spy vs. Spy.

45:52.583 --> 45:56.503
Not bad. Not a bad plan
for a washed-up old man.

45:56.587 --> 45:59.465
I am literally half your age.

45:59.548 --> 46:00.549
(CHUCKLES)

46:02.468 --> 46:05.262
SMULDERS: It's very
dark alley conversations.

46:05.345 --> 46:06.972
It's very film noir,

46:07.055 --> 46:11.477
and you're able to sort of see
him trying to navigate

46:11.560 --> 46:14.354
using his old techniques
in these new waters.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.398
(ALL LAUGHING)

46:19.318 --> 46:22.988
I think that the thing
that I'll take away from it is just like

46:23.697 --> 46:26.116
-the effect that these films have...
-(CREW CHEERING)

46:26.200 --> 46:27.576
...in people's lives.

46:28.911 --> 46:32.080
It's so cool
being a part of Marvel history,

46:32.164 --> 46:35.417
and when you meet people and you see
how much they love these movies

46:35.501 --> 46:37.878
and you see how... How excited they are

46:37.961 --> 46:40.923
about the characters and the story
and the future of it,

46:41.006 --> 46:43.133
it's just like... It's entertaining.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.053
But I think, you know, when it started,

46:46.136 --> 46:48.722
I think we all knew that
it was something special.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.140
JACKSON: There was an idea.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.477
SMULDERS: I think that there was
so much excitement,

46:54.478 --> 46:57.898
but I didn't imagine that the scope of it
would widen so much

46:57.981 --> 47:00.818
and this world would become so large.
