WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:06.464
[Shawn Levy] Should we start
making the movie, y'all?

00:06.548 --> 00:07.841
Monday morning. Let's go.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.884
I love <i>Deadpool 1</i> and <i>2.</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:13.805
I've always been a fan of Marvel movies.

00:13.888 --> 00:19.728
<i>And so, to get to kind of develop</i>
<i>certain muscles as a filmmaker in the MCU</i>

00:19.811 --> 00:22.772
<i>with this character</i>
<i>and this franchise I love so much,</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:24.566
<i>that was an opportunity I jumped at.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:28.987
This movie has definitely
introduced me to subjects,

00:29.070 --> 00:33.199
topics and all kinds of foul thoughts,
the likes of which I've never known.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.285
So thank you for that, <i>Deadpool.</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:37.662
<i>It's a little bit like destiny,</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:42.917
because it was a decade ago
on the set of <i>Real Steel</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:45.045
that Hugh Jackman said to me,

00:45.128 --> 00:46.880
"Hey, do you know Ryan Reynolds?"

00:46.963 --> 00:49.674
And I was like, "Nope.
I think he's Canadian like me."

00:49.758 --> 00:51.760
And he's like,
"If you ever work with Ryan,

00:51.843 --> 00:53.011
"you guys will never stop."

00:53.094 --> 00:55.805
- I'm glad that this is being captured.
- Yeah.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.183
- Strut lesson.
- [laughter]

00:58.266 --> 01:01.644
[Levy] <i>Frankly, Hugh Jackman</i>
<i>might be part-time prophet,</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:05.356
<i>because from the day I started</i>
<i>working on</i> Free Guy <i>with Ryan,</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:09.277
<i>there was this brotherhood</i>
<i>and this really kind of shared sense</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:12.447
<i>that we want to make movies</i>
<i>that are entertaining</i>

01:12.530 --> 01:16.159
<i>and understand that they're in</i>
<i>the business of being entertaining,</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:20.205
but that we also would like to believe
they can be fun and thematic

01:20.288 --> 01:23.500
and ultimately warm-hearted
in a way that, you know,

01:23.583 --> 01:26.836
allows us to leave
the theater feeling better

01:26.920 --> 01:29.214
and maybe more hopeful
than we did when we went in.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.925
[Ryan Reynolds] <i>I kind of think of Shawn</i>
<i>and I as, like, kelp underwater.</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:33.843
We're always kind of moving together.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.845
<i>He's one of those, like,</i>
<i>creative soulmates</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:38.056
<i>that I wish I'd found</i>
<i>earlier in my career,</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:39.265
<i>and I know he feels the same</i>

01:39.349 --> 01:41.684
<i>and we kind of have this</i>
<i>similar work ethic and rhythm.</i>

01:41.768 --> 01:45.980
We also are very lucky to have an ability
to cover for each other in certain ways.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.066
Movies like this are such an undertaking.

01:48.149 --> 01:52.070
[Levy] <i>Ryan and I rolled from</i>
<i>the kind of amazing chemistry we had</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:54.239
<i>on</i> Free Guy <i>right into</i> The Adam Project.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.616
<i>And it was when we were</i>
<i>shooting</i> The Adam Project

01:57.075 --> 02:00.370
that Ryan said, "Hey, you know,
I don't think I'll do a <i>Deadpool 3</i>

02:00.453 --> 02:02.664
"if you don't direct it.
Would you ever consider it?"

02:02.747 --> 02:04.082
And I was like, "Yeah."

02:04.165 --> 02:06.626
He goes, "I know I'm gonna
have to talk you into it."

02:06.709 --> 02:09.003
I'm like, "Nope,
you don't have to. It's a yes."

02:09.087 --> 02:10.088
Day one.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.979
I think there are a lot of fans
who have been patiently waiting

02:26.521 --> 02:29.774
<i>since long before the character</i>
<i>came back home to Marvel Studios.</i>

02:29.858 --> 02:33.444
<i>And then when it did,</i>
<i>we spent a long time working with Ryan</i>

02:33.528 --> 02:35.530
<i>to come up with the best idea.</i>

02:35.613 --> 02:37.824
<i>Ryan Reynolds is an idea machine.</i>

02:37.907 --> 02:41.995
<i>He is almost wholly responsible for</i>
<i>bringing that character to the big screen.</i>

02:42.078 --> 02:44.789
He believed in it
back when very few other people did,

02:44.873 --> 02:47.667
in a very different time
for Marvel movies.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.336
<i>And created something entirely unique.</i>

02:53.715 --> 02:56.509
It was a different tone.
I knew it would be something different.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.178
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

02:58.261 --> 03:00.388
His portrayal of Deadpool is so perfect.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.349
[sighs] This just feels right.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.226
[Wendy Jacobson]
<i>Because of</i> Deadpool 1 <i>and</i> 2,

03:05.310 --> 03:06.978
<i>the expectations are just high,</i>

03:07.061 --> 03:09.522
and we just want to keep
one-upping everything we do.

03:09.606 --> 03:13.276
<i>I think that was proven</i>
<i>in part of the early development process.</i>

03:13.359 --> 03:17.071
<i>I think Ryan had 19, 20 ideas,</i>
<i>throwing anything at the wall.</i>

03:17.155 --> 03:19.908
Aah! Okay. Well...

03:20.909 --> 03:22.535
I'm all out of aces, peanut.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.871
I mean, I'd pitch them
as, like, a Sundance movie.

03:24.954 --> 03:29.792
I'm not kidding.
Like a $4 million budget Marvel movie

03:29.876 --> 03:32.045
<i>with no action but a Deadpool suit.</i>

03:32.128 --> 03:36.174
Um, I pitched them mid-sized,
big, small, all kinds of stuff,

03:36.257 --> 03:38.760
So, I kind of felt like
I'd maybe run the gamut,

03:38.843 --> 03:40.637
and I didn't blame them. I blamed myself.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.430
You know, 'cause I'm Canadian.

03:42.513 --> 03:46.267
Get my country's name out of your mouth.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.145
I was going through my notes
the other day, looking at stuff.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.897
We had some crazy ideas.

03:50.980 --> 03:55.151
At one point, we talked about
a frame-for-frame remake of <i>Thor 2</i>

03:55.235 --> 03:58.821
<i>up until the midpoint with Deadpool in it,</i>
<i>and then it would go to another place.</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:02.700
<i>We had</i> Deadpool's
Deleted Scenes Extravaganza.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.496
<i>We were going to try and show</i>
<i>that he was in the MCU the whole time.</i>

04:06.579 --> 04:09.457
<i>You just didn't see his scenes.</i>
<i>They were all on the cutting room floor.</i>

04:09.540 --> 04:13.586
We were really trying to figure out
what was the reason for this movie to be.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.969
[Zeb Wells] <i>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine,</i>
<i>you could make a strong case</i>

04:21.052 --> 04:25.056
that the entire superhero movie industry
is built on that performance,

04:25.139 --> 04:28.184
because that performance
in <i>X-Men</i> showed everyone,

04:28.268 --> 04:32.188
<i>if you take these characters seriously,</i>
<i>and get them on the screen</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:36.067
as they're loved and written
in the comic book world, it works.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.193
I know you, bub?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.363
Nope. But I know you.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.532
[scoffs] Everybody knows me.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.410
I'm the Wolverine.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.746
I don't think I fully understood
what it meant to the wider world.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.750
I was not a comic book fan
in particular growing up.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.127
I had never heard of X-Men.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.296
<i>And in some ways,</i>
<i>I'm really glad I didn't know.</i>

04:56.379 --> 05:00.049
<i>Because I really approached Logan</i>
<i>as I would any other character.</i>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.468
Yes, he had claws coming out of him,
he could heal himself,

05:02.552 --> 05:03.845
and he had kind of crazy hair.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.347
But for me, it was just
another character to embody.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.640
I am wearing this suit.

05:07.724 --> 05:12.228
[breathing heavily] And that means
a lot of things, but most of all...

05:12.312 --> 05:13.521
it means I'm an X-Man.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.232
Wolverine is kind of
a Clint Eastwood archetype, you know.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.445
<i>He's very economical with words,</i>
<i>kind of only speaks if he has to speak,</i>

05:20.528 --> 05:23.323
really expresses himself through violence.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.657
Are you ready to be calm now?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.827
[grunting and groaning]

05:27.910 --> 05:30.621
[Reynolds] <i>Because he's an actor</i>
<i>that is like a Swiss Army Knife,</i>

05:30.705 --> 05:33.333
Hugh can really pivot
in strange and wonderful ways.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.711
This suit's all I got to remind me of
who they were.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.797
And what I did.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.467
Very early on in the process
of the <i>Deadpool's</i> history,

05:42.550 --> 05:45.636
we talked about, "Wouldn't it be great
to get him together with Wolverine?"

05:45.720 --> 05:47.805
But when it doesn't happen
through a couple of movies,

05:47.889 --> 05:51.726
and then they kill off Logan,
you start to lose faith in that idea

05:51.809 --> 05:54.604
and you don't really to think of it
as a real possibility anymore.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.358
I really thought when we finished <i>Logan,</i>

05:58.441 --> 06:00.693
I'm really proud of the film.
I'm proud of what we created.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.488
And I meant what I said when I was done.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.906
I just wanted...

06:05.782 --> 06:08.951
Get out everything that I had felt
in 20 years of the character.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.914
I wanted to be able to put that story
out there for the fans, for myself.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.543
<i>And then, August 14th, 2022,</i>

06:17.627 --> 06:19.879
<i>I was driving to the beach,</i>

06:19.962 --> 06:23.549
and in my head, I don't know why,

06:23.633 --> 06:26.386
"What you want to do, Hugh?"
That's the thought that came into my head.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.429
Not really work, just life.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.891
And like a bolt of lightning came,
"I want to do <i>Wolverine-Deadpool."</i>

06:31.974 --> 06:34.602
Sorry, Ryan.
That's how I see the title, by the way.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.479
Let's give the people what they came for.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.980
[grunts]

06:38.064 --> 06:39.899
[Jackman] <i>And so,</i>
<i>I was desperate to call Ryan</i>

06:39.982 --> 06:42.360
<i>'cause I knew that he and Shawn</i>
<i>were working on something.</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:45.154
I didn't know when they were shooting.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.281
There was just silence
on the end of the phone.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.659
I said, "If you'll have me,
I want to do this movie.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.785
"I know in my gut."

06:50.868 --> 06:52.412
[Reynolds] <i>It was literally kismet.</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:54.789
<i>I mean, it felt like</i>
<i>the stars were aligning</i>

06:54.872 --> 06:57.250
because I said,
"I'm about to go do my last pitch

06:57.333 --> 06:59.043
"for this character and this movie."

06:59.127 --> 07:01.838
<i>And I pitched a movie with him</i>
<i>where I was winging it.</i>

07:01.921 --> 07:03.297
<i>I wasn't prepared.</i>

07:03.381 --> 07:06.426
And the basic story was what is now made.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.804
Deadpool and Wolverine.
[chuckling] Can you imagine?

07:10.638 --> 07:11.681
Oh, the fun.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.225
The chaos.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.185
The residuals.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.354
I had always been very vocal with Hugh

07:18.438 --> 07:23.151
that he had one of the best endings
of any fictional character ever.

07:23.234 --> 07:27.363
<i>And I told him that is so amazing,</i>
<i>what he was able to accomplish in</i> Logan,

07:27.447 --> 07:31.534
that's what we were striving for
with Robert Downey Jr. in <i>Endgame,</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:35.705
is to give this incredible iconic
fictional character an amazing ending.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.457
Logan?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.500
The guy with forks for hands?

07:39.584 --> 07:40.835
That Wolverine?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.504
Obviously, I was throwing
a major spanner in the works, you know.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.755
But I just said, "I'm in."

07:44.839 --> 07:47.341
<i>'Cause I know Ryan and Shawn.</i>

07:47.425 --> 07:53.222
They also have such a reverence
for legacy and for the fans

07:53.306 --> 07:56.184
that I've never worked on something
where people have worked harder

07:56.267 --> 07:58.519
<i>to protect the integrity of Wolverine.</i>

07:58.603 --> 08:04.025
I have massive reverence
for <i>Logan</i> as a movie.

08:04.108 --> 08:08.529
In fact, it's one of the few times
in my life where I walked out of a movie,

08:08.613 --> 08:12.158
got the number of the director
and begged him to have lunch with me.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.702
And it was specifically
to ask James Mangold

08:14.785 --> 08:16.704
about what to me is

08:16.787 --> 08:21.709
top five, maybe top three
greatest final shots of any movie.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.796
<i>When Laura takes that cross</i>
<i>and puts it on its side,</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:28.841
<i>and it becomes an "X,"</i>
<i>I thought it was just perfect.</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:31.928
<i>I literally get goose bumps</i>
<i>thinking about it now.</i>

08:32.762 --> 08:34.055
And yet, we're making <i>Deadpool.</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:39.393
Deadpool <i>is defined</i>
<i>by subversiveness and audacity.</i>

08:39.936 --> 08:43.481
<i>And so, what if you make</i>
<i>the first scene of</i> Deadpool-Wolverine

08:43.564 --> 08:45.149
<i>the last shot of</i> Logan?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.360
We then started really riffing on,

08:47.443 --> 08:50.321
"Well, let's say we're there.
What would we do with that grave?"

08:50.696 --> 08:53.157
<i>That was one of those moments</i>
<i>where I was like,</i>

08:53.241 --> 08:56.285
<i>"We really have to make sure</i>
<i>that this delivers."</i>

08:56.369 --> 09:00.998
Like, how do we make
even those little throwaway things great?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.083
"G'day, mate.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.377
"There's nothing that'll
bring me back to life faster

09:04.460 --> 09:06.379
"than a big bag of Marvel cash."

09:07.046 --> 09:09.090
[laughs] Me too, Hugh.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.764
[Levy] Welcome to Logan's grave.

09:17.139 --> 09:20.935
<i>We are here in something called Black Park</i>
<i>in the United Kingdom.</i>

09:21.018 --> 09:23.271
June 2023.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.607
And today begins the cold open prologue.

09:26.691 --> 09:30.861
[yelling and screaming]

09:30.945 --> 09:34.115
We are on a Zoom,
Ryan and I are in my office in New York.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.534
We're on with Wernick and Reese in LA,

09:36.617 --> 09:39.453
our screenwriters who wrote
the first two <i>Deadpool</i> movies as well.

09:39.537 --> 09:43.082
<i>And Ryan's like, "I hate myself</i>
<i>for the idea I'm about to pitch."</i>

09:43.165 --> 09:45.167
[Reynolds] I could really use
your help right now.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.086
"I should use his body as a weapon."

09:51.966 --> 09:53.175
Yes.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.470
Once we had the concept for this sequence,

09:56.554 --> 09:59.640
<i>the next step was, "Okay,</i>
<i>what is the physicality of that?</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:00.975
<i>"What are the moves?"</i>

10:01.058 --> 10:04.687
One of the first people we hired
on this movie was Alex,

10:04.770 --> 10:06.772
<i>and he was a Deadpool stunt double,</i>

10:06.856 --> 10:10.276
the Deadpool stunt double,
the central one in <i>Deadpool 1.</i>

10:10.359 --> 10:12.945
<i>We knew that he was</i>
<i>a choreographic genius.</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:14.614
<i>He can also do things physically</i>

10:14.697 --> 10:17.825
<i>that are stunningly graceful</i>
<i>and imaginative.</i>

10:17.908 --> 10:19.910
<i>And we felt like here was an opportunity</i>

10:19.994 --> 10:21.704
<i>to give a super-talented guy</i>
<i>a major break.</i>

10:21.787 --> 10:23.497
- Peek-a-boo.
- [choking]

10:24.248 --> 10:26.042
Ready, and go.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.919
Do you want to describe the process?

10:29.003 --> 10:31.464
- Step one for this is called stunt-vis.
- Yes.

10:31.547 --> 10:35.343
[Levy] <i>That's where the stunt team</i>
<i>plays around with ideas,</i>

10:35.426 --> 10:37.887
<i>- literally films it on an iPhone.</i>
- [Alex] <i>Yes, exactly.</i>

10:37.970 --> 10:41.891
<i>And it's how we start to incubate</i>
<i>the creative on an action sequence.</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:43.976
So, what was the first step for you?

10:44.060 --> 10:48.064
The first step for us was just, you know,
going to a little shop, buying a skeleton,

10:48.147 --> 10:49.440
multiple of them,

10:49.523 --> 10:51.400
peeling it apart,
looking at it on the ground.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.028
<i>How do you kill people</i>
<i>with different parts of the skeleton?</i>

10:54.111 --> 10:56.656
I tried doing
the full body skeleton first.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.074
- Okay.
- See how it breaks.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.700
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- And then taking each bone</i>

10:59.784 --> 11:00.868
<i>and see how we can kill.</i>

11:00.951 --> 11:02.244
<i>And I'll grab a guy</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.246
<i>and we'll start choreographing</i>
<i>different moves.</i>

11:04.330 --> 11:05.706
And this was early in prep.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.376
So I'm sure right about now,
the editor of whatever you're watching

11:08.459 --> 11:10.920
<i>is going to cut</i>
<i>to Alex's earliest stunt-vis,</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:16.550
<i>where he's wearing, like,</i>
<i>a rinky-dink Deadpool-esque red costume.</i>

11:16.676 --> 11:18.511
<i>And it's where we started to get</i>

11:18.636 --> 11:25.643
<i>a sense of the imaginative,</i>
<i>violent, gory but also comedic action.</i>

11:27.061 --> 11:28.104
[both] Whoa!

11:28.437 --> 11:29.897
- Cut.
- [man] Cut.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.150
The M.O. from the beginning of this movie
was we want it in camera.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.111
We don't want to play with this in post.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.613
We want to bake this into the lens.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.826
<i>So, if there's an ability</i>
<i>to get this for real, let's do it.</i>

11:41.909 --> 11:44.912
<i>The special effects department</i>
<i>snowed a whole forest,</i>

11:44.995 --> 11:46.956
<i>and we shot it practically.</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:49.208
It's such an epic image, right?

11:49.291 --> 11:53.003
There's one shot in there
that we worked on for weeks

11:53.087 --> 11:56.340
to get it dialed in,
which was a high-speed 360 shot,

11:56.424 --> 11:58.592
<i>which involved Alex in the middle</i>

11:58.676 --> 12:04.056
<i>fighting 14 other TVA agents</i>
<i>as they came in</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:06.642
<i>with the camera on a high-speed rig</i>
<i>going around.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:10.896
<i>So, they dug a massive hole,</i>
<i>buried the camera in the ground,</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:14.775
<i>covered it all up, and then we worked</i>
<i>in and around this high-speed camera.</i>

12:14.859 --> 12:17.570
The idea was that
we would shoot that as a oner.

12:17.653 --> 12:21.657
<i>As the camera's going around,</i>
<i>all of the fights and the moves</i>

12:21.741 --> 12:25.911
<i>had to play to that camera</i>
<i>in those specific moments.</i>

12:25.995 --> 12:28.539
<i>So, it's a really tricky,</i>
<i>complicated shot.</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:33.210
We had 25 stunt guys for two weeks.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.506
And we must have killed all of them
at least two or three times.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.302
<i>I mean, it was just carnage.</i>

12:41.385 --> 12:43.137
I don't think it needs
to be any more brutal.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.098
I wonder if, uh, we punt the head away.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.310
[Cottle] <i>Ryan did this really great shot</i>
<i>where he got the skull,</i>

12:49.393 --> 12:50.644
<i>flipped it and kicked it.</i>

12:50.728 --> 12:53.147
<i>And we did this beautiful</i>
<i>wide in the forest,</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:55.149
<i>and there's just dead bodies</i>
<i>littered everywhere.</i>

12:55.232 --> 12:58.402
It's like the opening of <i>Private Ryan</i>
on the Omaha Beach.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.528
It's just crazy.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.490
It's gold! It's fucking gold!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.950
Okay, that's enough. Back to work.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.496
[Levy] <i>Ryan had given me the heads-up</i>

13:08.579 --> 13:11.415
<i>that the standards</i>
<i>of doing this franchise,</i>

13:11.499 --> 13:14.126
<i>especially when you're</i>
<i>the third of the</i> Deadpools,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.504
after two really, really good <i>Deadpools,</i>

13:16.587 --> 13:19.715
<i>the bar is higher than it almost ever is</i>
<i>on any movie.</i>

13:19.799 --> 13:23.302
<i>He said, "I'm just going to warn you.</i>
<i>It's not like a regular movie.</i>

13:23.385 --> 13:25.429
<i>"It's not even like a regular huge movie."</i>

13:26.096 --> 13:31.602
<i>Because on a</i> Deadpool <i>movie,</i>
<i>you need to get a great, great take,</i>

13:31.685 --> 13:36.023
<i>and that take, after which</i>
<i>you normally move on, on any other movie,</i>

13:36.106 --> 13:37.107
<i>you don't move on.</i>

13:37.191 --> 13:40.319
<i>You push for funnier, you push for better.</i>

13:40.402 --> 13:42.238
If it's a single in terms of funny...

13:42.321 --> 13:44.532
Like, we'd only want
triples or homers, right?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.827
<i>We were relentless with it.</i>

13:47.910 --> 13:50.454
<i>We never let it go,</i>
<i>even right into the sound mix.</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:53.374
You're going like,
"Maybe we can just change..."

13:53.457 --> 13:56.252
"Let's just stop
and think about this and..."

13:56.335 --> 13:59.755
And it's made the movie
the movie that it is, and I love it.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.174
The only thing I would say is that
when I go... [spitting]

14:02.258 --> 14:03.592
"Regenerate?" I would just...

14:03.676 --> 14:06.136
I know it's kind of weird.
Just let that hang in the air

14:06.220 --> 14:08.556
like the most uncomfortable
pause of all time.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.349
Yeah, like one, two...

14:10.432 --> 14:11.559
[Levy] <i>It's relentless.</i>

14:11.642 --> 14:14.812
<i>He warned me it would be relentless,</i>
<i>and it's every day on set.</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:16.647
<i>It's every moment in the cutting room.</i>

14:16.730 --> 14:21.235
<i>It's every moment that I get</i>
<i>a musical score from Rob Simonsen</i>

14:21.318 --> 14:26.156
<i>and I give a round of notes</i>
<i>to change that French horn to a trombone.</i>

14:26.240 --> 14:30.244
<i>You're talking about micro adjustments,</i>
<i>a change in a joke,</i>

14:30.327 --> 14:35.624
<i>one word different that takes her</i>
<i>from being funny to shockingly funny.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:37.251
Maybe I'll just get her turning to me.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.879
Doesn't even matter the line,
where I'm just heavy eye contact...

14:39.962 --> 14:41.088
Do you want to go again?

14:41.171 --> 14:42.756
- I do. I don't, but I do.
- Okay, great.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.841
Okay, but you do.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.968
If you can't be a responsible pet owner,

14:46.051 --> 14:48.053
then maybe you don't deserve
this little unicorn.

14:48.137 --> 14:53.893
So, I picked up that gauntlet,
and I've loved wearing it,

14:53.976 --> 14:55.853
if that's what you do with a gauntlet.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.898
[laughter and applause]

14:58.981 --> 15:00.524
Yeah!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.527
Better than we ever dreamed!

15:06.113 --> 15:07.615
Maximum effort.

15:07.698 --> 15:12.953
I think there's certain cornerstones
of expectation to a <i>Deadpool</i> movie, right?

15:13.037 --> 15:16.790
<i>Tone is the main one.</i>
<i>Brand of humor is another one.</i>

15:16.874 --> 15:19.919
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.
But it is for Disney.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.379
The occasional use of voice-over,

15:22.463 --> 15:26.383
<i>the occasional use of fourth wall breaks,</i>
<i>direct to camera.</i>

15:26.467 --> 15:28.052
Suck it, Fox!

15:28.135 --> 15:29.386
I'm going to Disneyland.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.388
- So good.
- Crazy fourth wall break.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.307
And I like where you put
the headbutt just now,

15:33.390 --> 15:34.433
not at the end.

15:34.516 --> 15:35.517
Yeah, I mean that...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.811
It's funny, there have been
moments where Ryan's like,

15:37.895 --> 15:39.647
"I don't know if we should do that again."

15:39.730 --> 15:42.483
I'm like, "No, no, I need to talk to you,
not only as your friend,

15:42.566 --> 15:45.611
"but as just Joe Audience,
fan of <i>Deadpool</i> movies.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.155
"Give me some of what I love, man."

15:48.238 --> 15:49.657
You're nasty.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.741
I love it.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.493
[Levy] <i>"Make it different,</i>

15:52.576 --> 15:55.788
<i>"but don't throw me</i>
<i>into completely unfamiliar waters."</i>

15:55.871 --> 16:00.000
<i>So I'm trying to strike that balance</i>
<i>of the expected and the beloved</i>

16:00.084 --> 16:01.585
<i>with the invention of the new.</i>

16:01.669 --> 16:03.712
I am about to give you
the thing you've always wanted.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.047
I smell what you're steppin' in.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.925
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.344
And we're looking at Deadpool.
Things are getting tense.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.596
Three, two, one. Zap.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.515
[Matthew MacFadyen]
<i>Working with Shawn and Ryan,</i>

16:14.598 --> 16:17.726
it's sort of lovely to watch
people you've sort of admired from afar

16:17.810 --> 16:19.520
and then you see them at work.

16:19.603 --> 16:22.272
And it's great that,
to see them being so nimble

16:22.356 --> 16:26.485
<i>and sort of effortlessly funny</i>
<i>and quick and adaptable.</i>

16:26.568 --> 16:30.572
Ryan knows Deadpool so well,
and so, if you pitch an idea,

16:30.656 --> 16:33.617
<i>sometimes he'll just</i>
<i>start riffing as Deadpool.</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:35.369
Adamantium katanas.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.662
You shouldn't have.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.664
Boom, boom, boom. Boom.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.250
- You know, landing here. There you go.
- [soft laughter]

16:41.667 --> 16:42.960
Let yourself release,

16:43.043 --> 16:44.670
just suckle that... That whole thing.

16:44.753 --> 16:48.465
You feel like Deadpool's
sort of got his hand on the wheel.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.968
And I'm just going to say,
"Why was Thor crying?"

16:51.885 --> 16:54.430
- Then you can ignore me and keep going.
- Okay

16:54.513 --> 16:55.889
It's an amazing atmosphere.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.018
<i>Everything is incredibly</i>
<i>planned out meticulously,</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:01.478
<i>and once you have</i>
<i>that secure framework in place,</i>

17:01.562 --> 17:06.358
you do have the space to play
and to do, like, off-the-cuff jokes,

17:06.442 --> 17:08.652
<i>which is what Ryan and Shawn</i>
<i>both do so well.</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:11.780
The only thing that might just be
just so childish and stupid,

17:11.864 --> 17:15.409
you may not want to use it, is the
"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God..."

17:15.492 --> 17:17.578
- Oh, my God, he's gonna say it. Hah!
- Fuck.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.163
- He's gonna say it!
- Say what?

17:19.246 --> 17:20.247
Avengers, assemble...

17:20.330 --> 17:21.582
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

17:21.665 --> 17:25.794
[Levy] <i>Because Ryan and I are in</i>
<i>our fifth year of collaborating together,</i>

17:25.878 --> 17:29.006
many times in the middle of a scene,
I'll be like, "Hey, Ry, could you..."

17:29.089 --> 17:32.426
He goes, "Yep. 'Cause with the... Yeah."

17:32.509 --> 17:34.428
<i>And he knows what I was going to say.</i>

17:34.511 --> 17:37.765
Ryan, just show me that gesture.
That body...

17:37.848 --> 17:39.516
Yep. Yeah. Thank you.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.061
They'll walk away for a minute
and kind of be like... [chatters]

17:42.144 --> 17:46.398
And then they'll come back
and it cracks me up.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.610
<i>Like, just trying not to</i>
<i>crack up on set is hard</i>

17:49.693 --> 17:51.528
<i>because every time it's different.</i>

17:51.612 --> 17:53.697
Canadians are supposed to be nice!

17:54.406 --> 17:57.409
One more outburst like that
and I will turn this car around!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.328
God, you are such a dick!

17:59.870 --> 18:02.581
Is it "gubernatorial"?
It's a confusing word.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.124
Cut.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.752
It's such a fun thing to be a part of,
but intimidating as well.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.923
I'm going to use your little contraption
to destroy this universe,

18:11.465 --> 18:15.344
and the next and the next and the next...

18:15.427 --> 18:17.346
until I lap up the Sacred Timeline

18:17.429 --> 18:19.807
like a cartoon puppy eating spaghetti.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.391
[slurping, munching]

18:21.475 --> 18:24.019
It'll be funny if she doesn't know
how to eat spaghetti.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.395
So, she's like...

18:25.479 --> 18:26.480
Or... [gnawing]

18:26.563 --> 18:29.358
[laughter]

18:29.441 --> 18:32.319
It's knowing what and part when.

18:32.402 --> 18:36.073
When to say like, "Okay, no.
Maybe let's not have that joke here."

18:36.156 --> 18:38.408
Or, "This needs to be
more of a sincere beat.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.495
<i>"Let's work on what is this relationship</i>
<i>between these two people about."</i>

18:44.289 --> 18:47.876
in The Void you can be what you are.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.922
I just wanna be free.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.093
[Levy] <i>Ryan and I both think a lot about</i>

18:56.176 --> 18:58.595
<i>what makes the heart</i>
<i>underneath the laughs.</i>

18:58.679 --> 19:01.306
I know I turn everything into a joke,
but I care.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.936
Just wanna matter.
I wanna show my girl that I matter.

19:06.019 --> 19:09.064
I... I need to matter.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.358
Wade has never been the world-saving type.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.862
As he says in his own words,
he messes people up for money.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.990
Sometimes he does the right thing
in spite of himself.

19:18.073 --> 19:21.743
But we wanted big stakes
for <i>Deadpool & Wolverine,</i>

19:22.661 --> 19:24.371
<i>and world-saving stakes.</i>

19:24.454 --> 19:27.207
<i>And yet, Wade's world is nine people.</i>

19:27.291 --> 19:28.625
It's been a challenging few years.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.794
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.296
Been through a lot.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.380
But I'm happy.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.174
You know, and that's...

19:35.257 --> 19:37.843
because of each and every one of you.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.970
I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

19:40.053 --> 19:41.513
how proud I am, how grateful I am...

19:41.597 --> 19:42.931
to be standing in a room...

19:43.015 --> 19:45.851
with every single person I love.

19:45.934 --> 19:50.898
[Levy] <i>We knew that the movie</i>
<i>needed to be anchored in stakes.</i>

19:50.981 --> 19:52.858
You're gonna Old Yeller my universe?

19:54.359 --> 19:55.903
In your parlance, yes.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.321
And if you're Wade Wilson,

19:57.404 --> 20:00.616
the stakes are not, "I'm going to do
the noble thing and save the universe."

20:00.699 --> 20:03.160
It's, "I'm going to do
the thing I am compelled to do,

"which is to save my friends,
because my friends are my world."

20:07.539 --> 20:11.627
Deadpool realizes he's got
to find some way to fix this.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.255
He thinks he can replace the Anchor Being
with another Wolverine.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.715
I'll do it.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.718
Wise choice.
The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.470
I was talking about finding the Wolverine

20:21.553 --> 20:23.013
and breaking your fucking nose.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.306
[groans]

20:29.519 --> 20:30.812
[Wade] Logan.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.774
[Dean Zimmerman] <i>In the script,</i>
<i>we find a few Wolverine variants.</i>

20:34.274 --> 20:36.526
Oh, my God. The legends are true.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.863
When we put it together,
it almost wanted to be this montage.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.032
But we didn't have enough pieces
to make it a montage.

20:42.115 --> 20:46.995
So it wasn't until we showed Shawn like,
"Here's what we're thinking."

20:47.079 --> 20:48.413
<i>Then all of a sudden, it's like,</i>

20:48.497 --> 20:51.458
<i>"Well, let's get the John Byrne</i>
<i>brown and tan costume.</i>

20:51.541 --> 20:53.752
<i>"Let's get Wolverine on the cross.</i>

20:53.835 --> 20:56.004
<i>"Let's get Cavillrine."</i>

20:56.088 --> 20:57.464
- [Reid] <i>Old Man Logan.</i>
<i>- Old Man Logan.</i>

20:57.547 --> 21:01.051
We hit some, like,
real deep-cut comic fans

21:01.134 --> 21:05.138
to start digging out these Logan variants
that existed over time.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.307
[Zimmerman] <i>And we were listening,</i>
<i>paying attention.</i>

21:07.391 --> 21:09.810
<i>The support from the studio is unwavering</i>

21:09.893 --> 21:14.773
<i>'cause the John Byrne, the big classic,</i>
<i>iconic image of the comic book,</i>

21:14.856 --> 21:16.316
<i>is brown and tan costume, claws out,</i>

21:16.400 --> 21:19.361
<i>and you see Hulk in the reflection.</i>

21:19.444 --> 21:20.946
"Okay, so can we have Hulk?"

21:21.697 --> 21:22.864
Marvel, "Sure."

21:23.490 --> 21:28.036
[Reynolds] <i>So many late-game saves</i>
<i>and ideas and thoughts</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:31.498
and collaborations
came from all over the place.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.334
I don't care whose idea it is.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.629
Let's make this the best thing
we could possibly do.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.548
Comic accurate short king.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.759
Beautiful. But, unfortunately,
a reluctant pass.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.638
[Reid] <i>Shawn and Ryan are also very aware</i>

21:46.722 --> 21:49.808
<i>that what the fans really want</i>
<i>in these situations</i>

21:49.891 --> 21:52.936
are recreations of things
that are iconic to them.

21:53.020 --> 21:57.566
<i>So, let's make them look like</i>
<i>the cover that they saw.</i>

21:57.649 --> 22:01.194
<i>So there's a respect there</i>
<i>to the material, the source material.</i>

22:01.278 --> 22:02.988
<i>And then, at the same time, it's like</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:05.449
<i>we're contrasting it with Huey Lewis,</i>
The Power of Love.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.327
- From <i>Back to the Future.</i>
- Yeah.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.953
Which they had to go through...

22:10.037 --> 22:13.415
- Incredibly.
- Their own mountain to secure, but...

22:13.498 --> 22:15.625
Yeah, Shawn called Spielberg and Zemeckis.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.295
<i>And the ungettable get we're getting.</i>

22:18.378 --> 22:20.464
It's just this beautiful marriage
of pop culture.

22:23.884 --> 22:24.926
This one looks promising.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.806
I need you to come with me right now.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.559
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

22:32.642 --> 22:38.273
The paradigms for <i>Deadpool & Wolverine</i>
were the great two-hander road trips.

22:38.774 --> 22:42.194
That's <i>Midnight Run,</i>
<i>Planes, Trains & Automobiles.</i>

22:42.277 --> 22:44.029
In some weird way, it's <i>Rain Man.</i>

22:44.112 --> 22:47.532
<i>It's about two people stuck on a quest,</i>

22:47.616 --> 22:51.828
<i>who in no normal circumstances</i>
<i>would choose to spend a minute together.</i>

22:51.912 --> 22:53.080
Now they've got to spend days.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.831
You mind putting your mask back on?

22:54.915 --> 22:56.583
It's super hard to eat while wearing it.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.168
It's super hard to eat when you're not.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.921
[Jackman] <i>I'd always felt</i>
<i>that this is a dynamic</i>

23:01.004 --> 23:02.881
<i>that would be so much fun to play.</i>

23:02.964 --> 23:04.925
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

23:05.008 --> 23:08.220
They don't call me "The Merc
with the Sage and Timely Counsel."

23:08.303 --> 23:09.346
[groans]

23:10.555 --> 23:11.556
One more word.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.060
And I know the fans would love it.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.229
Gubernatorial.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.232
[grunting and groaning]

23:20.315 --> 23:26.071
It's such a great opposing force,
you know, for Deadpool.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.697
[groans, gasps]

23:27.781 --> 23:28.782
What you thinkin'?

23:28.865 --> 23:31.993
[Wernick] <i>We've always wanted,</i>
<i>you know, that perfect straight man.</i>

23:32.077 --> 23:35.747
And yet, I wouldn't say
Wolverine is a straight man

23:35.831 --> 23:37.124
as much as he is...

23:37.207 --> 23:38.458
He's a lunatic.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.668
Hey.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.254
- Oh, Christ.
- [Levy] Cut.

23:42.337 --> 23:48.093
It has this innate potential
for something emotional.

23:48.176 --> 23:52.264
How do relationships evolve,
including ones that start with hatred?

23:52.347 --> 23:55.058
In my world, you're, um... [clears throat]

23:56.017 --> 23:57.269
You're well regarded.

23:57.352 --> 23:59.229
Yeah, well, not in mine.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.816
- They don't like me much in mine either.
- You don't say.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.902
The stress I had
as one of the writers of the movie

24:05.986 --> 24:08.155
<i>was finding the access point</i>
<i>into Wolverine,</i>

24:08.238 --> 24:11.408
<i>that, one, allows audiences to connect</i>
<i>with a character</i>

24:11.491 --> 24:13.785
that they've known
for more than two decades,

24:13.869 --> 24:16.288
but also does something different
with the character

24:16.371 --> 24:18.415
<i>that hasn't yet been done.</i>

24:18.498 --> 24:22.419
<i>In the first script that we wrote,</i>
<i>Hugh sent us a 10-minute voice memo.</i>

24:22.502 --> 24:26.089
Which I don't recommend,
sending a 10-minute voice memo to anyone.

24:26.173 --> 24:30.302
But the idea that
he was the worst Wolverine

24:30.385 --> 24:34.639
<i>is the thing that came</i>
<i>of Hugh's voice memo.</i>

24:34.723 --> 24:36.558
It was such a great access point for us

24:36.641 --> 24:38.643
'cause you not only have
the worst Wolverine,

24:38.727 --> 24:42.856
but you have a Wolverine that is finally,
after 24 years, wearing the yellow suit,

24:42.939 --> 24:45.317
<i>you know, wandering around set</i>
<i>like Admiral Banana.</i>

24:45.942 --> 24:49.905
So what made you finally commit
to wearing an honest-to-God costume?

24:51.364 --> 24:53.325
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.369
I see how yellow could be useful too.

25:02.876 --> 25:07.005
[Jackman] <i>When I got in the yellow</i>
<i>and blue, I knew it would work.</i>

25:07.088 --> 25:11.426
The thing that I'd been worried about
was unfounded.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.220
Anything about the suit

25:13.303 --> 25:16.556
<i>somehow in real life,</i>
<i>as opposed to in the comic book,</i>

25:16.640 --> 25:18.683
<i>would make him look too cartoon-y</i>

25:18.767 --> 25:22.187
or just garish or over-the-top
or something. No.

25:22.270 --> 25:27.651
[Reynolds] <i>I remember that first day</i>
<i>that Hugh and I were both in the suits.</i>

25:27.734 --> 25:30.862
<i>We walked down this, like,</i>
<i>catwalk thing in the TVA,</i>

25:30.946 --> 25:33.281
and a gentleman named Billy Lawless,

25:33.365 --> 25:38.453
who's in charge of helping me
get my suit on each and every day,

25:38.537 --> 25:40.789
'cause the suit
is its own feat of engineering,

25:40.872 --> 25:44.292
<i>when he saw both Deadpool and Wolverine</i>
<i>walking down that catwalk,</i>

25:44.376 --> 25:46.127
he said it was the best day of his life.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.462
[chuckling] And I was like...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.422
I was like,
"You have a son though, Billy."

25:49.506 --> 25:52.259
And he said, "Yes.
My son's name is Logan."

25:52.342 --> 25:54.302
Twenty-four years since I first did this.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.762
[man] It wasn't!

25:55.845 --> 25:58.306
But the fans have been asking for this
for 24 years.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.183
Oh, fuck it. Excuse me.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.518
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughter]

26:01.601 --> 26:02.978
[Jackman] <i>It felt amazing.</i>

26:03.061 --> 26:08.942
<i>I felt more grounded, deeper connected</i>
<i>than I ever had before in the 24 years.</i>

26:09.025 --> 26:10.944
<i>And the suit had</i>
<i>a lot to do with that, I think.</i>

26:11.027 --> 26:12.612
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.281
Well, that suit says different.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.199
Do you like it?

26:16.283 --> 26:20.870
I was astonished at how
we never tried it, never looked at it.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.374
<i>But when I see it and when I see it</i>
<i>particularly with that cowl...</i>

26:24.457 --> 26:25.625
Holy shit.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.169
You save the good stuff
for special occasions?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.254
Killing mostly.

26:29.337 --> 26:34.551
I feel more than ever before
me, Hugh Jackman, is lost, gone.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.011
It's just Wolverine.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.096
Listen to me.
Now, this is Sabretooth, all right?

26:38.179 --> 26:39.556
Twenty years in the making.

26:39.639 --> 26:40.932
You cannot take this guy.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.142
Do not go for the head.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.518
You guys got no grappling game.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.270
Okay, good luck and Godspeed.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.731
[Jackman] <i>The suit's tight,</i>
<i>it pulls you down.</i>

26:47.814 --> 26:52.193
<i>It's actually, weirdly, really good</i>
<i>in some ways for doing the action,</i>

26:52.277 --> 26:53.987
<i>makes you very coiled.</i>

26:54.070 --> 26:57.073
But the motion, it's hard to move.
It's hard to get your elbow...

26:57.157 --> 27:00.327
like, literally getting
your arms above here.

27:01.161 --> 27:04.080
[Levy] That's impossible.
No, that's not graceful.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.249
What about... And the other hand's worse?

27:07.334 --> 27:09.461
That is very close.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.463
But we did some amazing
action sequences in this,

27:11.546 --> 27:13.590
one of which is the longest
I've ever done in my life.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.181
[Levy] <i>So we are here</i>
<i>in the lovely Burnham Beeches.</i>

27:21.264 --> 27:23.016
<i>We're in the UK and we're shooting</i>

27:23.099 --> 27:25.560
what we effectually refer to
as the van fight.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.814
This idea came out in the earliest,
as I recall,

27:29.898 --> 27:31.399
the first draft of the script.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.818
<i>The idea that audiences expect</i>
<i>the mother of all fights</i>

27:33.902 --> 27:35.403
<i>between Wolverine and Deadpool,</i>

27:35.487 --> 27:38.615
<i>But what if we do it in a way</i>
<i>that's unexpected?</i>

27:38.698 --> 27:45.121
<i>What if we do it inside the confines</i>
<i>of a lovely late model Honda Odyssey?</i>

27:45.205 --> 27:47.040
I'm gonna fight you now.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.584
[laughing, snorting]

27:49.668 --> 27:50.960
Oh, are you?

27:51.044 --> 27:54.381
[Jackman] <i>Shawn understands this thing</i>
<i>where you must be ahead of the audience.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:56.091
The ideas must keep elevating.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.676
<i>They must keep changing and evolving.</i>

27:57.759 --> 28:00.053
[Alex] <i>This is what's really unique</i>
<i>about Shawn and Ryan.</i>

28:00.136 --> 28:03.390
They're never married to an idea.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.935
<i>If there is a way</i>
<i>of telling a better story,</i>

28:07.018 --> 28:08.395
<i>they are open for this idea.</i>

28:08.478 --> 28:13.441
I don't know how any one director
or one producer or one writer or anyone

28:13.525 --> 28:18.196
does anything in the singular sense,
'cause you just need so much help.

28:18.279 --> 28:22.325
Is it too much just to fucking run into it
like you're tackling the car?

28:22.409 --> 28:23.493
Like you're ramming it.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.204
Either ramming it
or just head into it or something.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.707
<i>There's a part of Wolverine</i>
<i>that loves a fight.</i>

28:28.790 --> 28:31.418
Like, there's a part of him
never more alive than than in a fight.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.502
[Levy] Yes, yes.

28:32.585 --> 28:35.213
And doesn't mind a headbutt, like...

28:35.296 --> 28:38.007
Yeah. Maybe that's what this this is, too.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.926
It's like
when it gives that beat, you know,

28:40.009 --> 28:42.637
like the "Violence is our love language."

28:42.721 --> 28:43.763
Boom!

28:46.224 --> 28:49.269
[Jackman] <i>When I first was pitched</i>
<i>that scene, Shawn showed it to me,</i>

28:49.352 --> 28:50.770
<i>we were on a plane together.</i>

28:51.146 --> 28:52.772
And he actually videoed me.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.650
There was a video of me
watching it for the first time.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.278
<i>I'm literally crying hysterically.</i>

28:58.361 --> 29:00.739
<i>It was just the most genius thing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:03.324
And I loved the scene as the lead-up.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.620
<i>A road trip with the most</i>
<i>annoying person of your life.</i>

29:07.704 --> 29:09.748
<i>And finally, he snaps.</i>

29:09.831 --> 29:11.040
[grunting]

29:12.250 --> 29:13.585
We are just getting started.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.712
[grunting and groaning]

29:15.795 --> 29:17.547
[Levy] <i>By virtue of being R-rated,</i>

29:17.630 --> 29:20.592
<i>it's an opportunity to make an MCU movie</i>

29:20.675 --> 29:22.594
with a degree of edge

29:22.677 --> 29:25.930
and comedic subversiveness.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.349
[Cottle] <i>With regards to action,</i>
<i>any normal Marvel movie,</i>

29:28.433 --> 29:29.768
<i>you have to work out</i>

29:29.851 --> 29:31.102
how many headbutts you can do

29:31.186 --> 29:32.520
or how much blood you can see.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.981
And then you walk onto this set
and it's just...

29:35.440 --> 29:36.691
It's just...

29:36.775 --> 29:39.027
[screams, shrieks]

29:39.110 --> 29:42.113
You are yanking this thing so hard,
you fucking jump back,

29:42.197 --> 29:44.282
<i>- spin around and I'm holding it.</i>
- [Levy] <i>Ah, right.</i>

29:44.365 --> 29:46.159
<i>And then my feet go through the sunroof.</i>

29:46.242 --> 29:47.494
<i>All in one move.</i>

29:47.577 --> 29:48.787
We slide back... Boom!

29:48.870 --> 29:51.080
[grunting, yelling]

29:53.166 --> 29:55.710
It's two people fighting who can't die.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.795
It's amazing.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.672
Once you get his head to the side...

29:59.756 --> 30:01.800
- Yeah.
- ...and you're doing these

30:01.883 --> 30:04.010
and I see the bumper sticker,
I'm gonna cut it sooner.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.763
You're gonna have to be
quite the jackhammer.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.307
[Reynolds] Ha-ha!

30:09.390 --> 30:14.020
[Jackman] <i>Every bit of action</i>
<i>is so inventive and unique</i>

30:14.103 --> 30:18.274
<i>and funny and brutal</i>
<i>and stuff you've never seen before.</i>

30:19.734 --> 30:20.777
[groaning]

30:20.860 --> 30:23.071
And it's so hard to do that.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.240
[Levy whooping and laughing]

30:25.323 --> 30:26.950
Yeah!

30:27.033 --> 30:28.034
[man] Amazing.

30:36.709 --> 30:39.796
We knew that we wanted
a really formidable villain,

30:39.879 --> 30:42.423
and we started talking about something
I had never heard about,

30:42.507 --> 30:43.716
an omega-level mutant.

30:43.800 --> 30:48.429
<i>And this character of Cassandra Nova,</i>
<i>who is Charles Xavier's twin.</i>

30:48.513 --> 30:50.390
<i>And around that time</i>

30:50.473 --> 30:53.101
<i>I was watching</i> The Crown <i>with Emma Corrin,</i>

30:53.184 --> 30:55.645
<i>and I thought,</i>
<i>"Wow. This actor is incredible."</i>

30:56.145 --> 30:58.857
And I went to England
and I saw Emma in a stage production.

30:59.357 --> 31:03.528
And we went out to dinner afterwards
and I knew that this was Cassandra Nova.

31:03.611 --> 31:07.240
<i>So we literally never had a backup,</i>
<i>never even had a second idea.</i>

31:07.448 --> 31:08.783
<i>And thankfully, Emma said, "Yes."</i>

31:08.867 --> 31:10.285
Not what I was expecting.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.039
Don't worry, I won't judge you.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.418
I'm not Charles.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.546
They said, "Forget everything
you've ever seen or heard about villains.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.298
"Don't treat this as a villain."

31:23.381 --> 31:25.466
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>the first reference Ryan gave me</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:28.344
<i>was Christoph Waltz</i>
<i>in</i> Inglourious Basterds.

31:28.469 --> 31:32.181
<i>He doesn't have to act evil</i>
<i>because he's wearing that uniform.</i>

31:32.265 --> 31:35.935
It says it for him,
and it's ten times more sinister.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.353
You're that scary, huh?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.230
The TVA certainly thought so.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.816
They sent me here before I could walk.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.152
So that's what we went for
because I've got the bald head

31:44.235 --> 31:49.073
and the collar and the villain
silhouette and these elongated fingers.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.577
<i>That are just enough to kind of see</i>

31:52.660 --> 31:53.870
<i>and you kind of don't.</i>

31:53.953 --> 31:56.581
What's going on in here?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.499
<i>It's all saying "evil."</i>

31:58.583 --> 32:01.669
<i>So then it's really fun</i>
<i>to be unpredictable.</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:04.130
<i>There's something off-kilter</i>
<i>that makes you sort of lean in.</i>

32:04.213 --> 32:07.383
Yeah, Johnny told us. You're a "psychotic,
megalomaniacal asshole."

32:07.467 --> 32:10.553
His words, not mine.
Hellbent on domination and pain.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.890
- You said all that about me?
- No!

32:13.973 --> 32:15.308
[Reynolds] <i>Chris and I have a history</i>

32:15.391 --> 32:18.895
<i>of trading cameos in movies,</i>
<i>and he was just so in.</i>

32:18.978 --> 32:20.104
Man, this is great. Come on.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.106
[Reynolds] <i>Because I wrote</i>
<i>this setup for him,</i>

32:22.190 --> 32:25.443
where Deadpool talks about him
as the ultimate trash talker.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.738
That it's not me. You know,
he's the shit talker, extreme,

32:28.821 --> 32:30.031
my hat's off to this guy.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.699
And in the movie, you're like, "Wait.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.034
"But he doesn't talk like that."

32:33.117 --> 32:36.204
<i>Deadpool's just getting another guy</i>
<i>killed, which Deadpool is very good at.</i>

32:36.329 --> 32:37.580
Not my favorite Chris.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.041
<i>So I wrote this tag for Chris.</i>

32:40.208 --> 32:43.419
Initially, I just wrote it
to trick and manipulate Chris

32:43.503 --> 32:44.671
into saying yes.

32:44.754 --> 32:47.298
"But there's also this scene."

32:47.423 --> 32:51.427
And then it became something
that was really funny, actually,

32:51.511 --> 32:53.054
I was, "This has to be in the movie."

32:53.137 --> 32:56.307
And Chris only agreed to do the movie
as long as that tag stays in the movie.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.226
Which I don't blame him at all.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.354
If the last thing I do in this godforsaken
cum-gutter existence...

33:01.437 --> 33:04.232
is light that fuck-box on fire,
I still won't die happy.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.067
[chuckling] Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.986
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until...

33:08.069 --> 33:10.154
I've urinated
on her freshly barbecued corpse

33:10.238 --> 33:11.948
and husk-fucked the charred remains,

33:12.031 --> 33:13.825
while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.952
- Wow! 'Kay.
- And you can quote me.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.965
[Jacobson] <i>Here we are</i>
<i>in the hero hideout.</i>

33:29.048 --> 33:32.301
This hideout is comprised
of various variants

33:32.385 --> 33:34.387
and Easter eggs from the Marvel universe.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.597
Where are we?

33:37.432 --> 33:40.018
No clue, but... I like it here.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.938
Fans may recognize this amazing bed,

33:44.272 --> 33:47.942
<i>which was where the Hulk</i>
<i>slept in</i> Thor: Ragnarok <i>in Sakaar.</i>

33:48.026 --> 33:51.779
We've got this table
from Carol's spaceship from <i>The Marvels,</i>

33:51.863 --> 33:55.533
<i>and Ray Chan did an incredible job</i>
<i>with this space.</i>

33:55.616 --> 33:57.952
<i>There are so many different details.</i>

33:58.036 --> 33:59.829
[Chan] <i>So the brief from</i>
<i>Shawn and Wendy was,</i>

33:59.996 --> 34:03.791
<i>"We'd like to put in some</i>
<i>Easter eggs for our fans."</i>

34:03.875 --> 34:05.710
One particular set caught my eye.

34:05.793 --> 34:09.839
A 24-foot high sculpt of Wanda,

34:10.298 --> 34:13.468
which was used in <i>Doctor Strange 2.</i>

34:13.551 --> 34:17.847
And it was used in a temple,
and the temple was about 32 feet high,

34:17.930 --> 34:22.810
and I thought, "Well, I will take that
sculpt and lay it into the ceiling."

34:22.894 --> 34:26.647
<i>So it became the ceiling of the hideout.</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:29.901
It's really been thought out.
Where would each person sleep?

34:29.984 --> 34:31.360
<i>What would their possessions be?</i>

34:31.444 --> 34:33.696
<i>They live in the Void.</i>
<i>What have they scavenged?</i>

34:34.113 --> 34:38.367
Look at you... all.
You must be the others.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.369
[Chan] <i>Just to see those heroes,</i>

34:40.453 --> 34:43.873
and they are heroes, in the set
was just incredible.

34:46.918 --> 34:51.422
I received a message from Ryan.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.800
And he said, "Give me a call."

34:54.467 --> 34:55.927
I thought it was kind of odd.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.179
I said, "What could this guy
be calling me for?"

34:58.262 --> 35:01.390
<i>He revealed to me that he was thinking</i>

35:01.474 --> 35:05.061
<i>about me joining the team</i>
<i>for this</i> Deadpool.

35:05.895 --> 35:09.023
I said, "Well, hey,
if you can work it out, yeah."

35:09.107 --> 35:14.737
Wesley is Blade to me
and ushered in a whole era.

35:14.821 --> 35:15.863
I was born ready.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.658
[Reynolds] <i>This is a character</i>
<i>that Wesley, in large part, created.</i>

35:18.741 --> 35:21.953
And took risks back then
that hadn't really been done.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.205
There's only ever been one Blade,

35:24.288 --> 35:26.040
and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.834
Yeah, dog. Let's go.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.128
It really does feel I'm the radio winner

35:30.211 --> 35:32.421
they let play background for a day.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.592
<i>I've been dancing around Gambit</i>
<i>for close to 20 years now.</i>

35:36.676 --> 35:38.886
<i>You don't have to ask Channing Tatum</i>
<i>to play Gambit.</i>

35:38.970 --> 35:41.180
I mean, Channing's been trying to get
a Gambit movie made

35:41.264 --> 35:43.307
for as long as I was trying
to get a Deadpool movie.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.018
<i>I mean, we were at Comic Con</i>
<i>together in 2016</i>

35:46.102 --> 35:47.854
when Fox was going to make that movie.

35:47.937 --> 35:52.024
If you don't know what it's like to see...

35:52.108 --> 35:54.986
Shawn I've met a couple of times
to possibly direct <i>Gambit</i>

35:55.069 --> 35:57.196
when I was attached to it at Fox.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.866
<i>So they called me about this one,</i>
<i>and I couldn't even believe it.</i>

35:59.949 --> 36:02.410
I thought they might have been
teasing me or joking me,

36:02.493 --> 36:03.828
it was like a practical joke.

36:03.911 --> 36:09.584
I'd have done truly anything to actually
walk onto the screen as Gambit

36:09.667 --> 36:10.835
<i>just even one time.</i>

36:14.589 --> 36:17.675
It's actually really lovely
to step back into Elektra.

36:17.758 --> 36:21.012
<i>I played Elektra in 2004.</i>

36:21.095 --> 36:23.055
<i>So I had not picked up a sai</i>

36:23.139 --> 36:26.017
other than to show off
for my kids' friends.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.602
Like, "I'm a ninja."

36:28.811 --> 36:31.814
<i>I hadn't done anything like that</i>
<i>in years and years and years.</i>

36:31.898 --> 36:36.444
Da, da, stab. And then when I do this,
I'm driving us back.

36:37.153 --> 36:41.991
<i>Bringing Elektra into this</i>
<i>Deadpool world has been a total trip.</i>

36:43.242 --> 36:44.619
[grunting]

36:46.120 --> 36:48.080
[Reynolds] <i>It was wonderful</i>
<i>to see Dafne Keen</i>

36:48.164 --> 36:49.957
<i>as Laura a little bit older and wiser</i>

36:50.041 --> 36:53.169
and now we get to really see
what the Logan character means to her.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.921
I got to grow up because of you.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.590
<i>Finding this new, more mature, older Laura</i>

36:57.673 --> 37:01.135
was very interesting because
she's still intrinsically, nature wise,

37:01.219 --> 37:04.305
<i>she's still that wild, feral character,</i>

37:04.388 --> 37:06.224
<i>but also, at the same time,</i>
<i>she's now grown,</i>

37:06.307 --> 37:09.101
<i>and she's got more management</i>
<i>of her emotions in a way.</i>

37:09.185 --> 37:10.311
Don't make me regret it.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.189
To me, it seems like
because I played her at such a young age,

37:13.272 --> 37:16.609
she's sort of embedded in me,
and she's been waiting to come out again.

37:16.692 --> 37:18.986
X-23, what's it gonna be?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.112
The name's Laura.

37:20.196 --> 37:23.074
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

37:33.125 --> 37:35.378
This is, by the way, the most mental shot

37:35.461 --> 37:36.796
in a comic book movie of all time.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.840
It's about to get more mental!

37:39.924 --> 37:41.300
I didn't want to stop yesterday.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.719
Everybody was tired.
I was, like, "Do we have to go home?

37:43.844 --> 37:45.054
"Do I have to take it off?"

37:45.137 --> 37:46.555
<i>I didn't see this costume coming</i>

37:46.639 --> 37:48.808
<i>because when we were planning</i>
<i>to do the other Gambit,</i>

37:48.891 --> 37:52.979
he wasn't in the X-Men yet,
so he wouldn't have had this full armor.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.314
<i>And then this, we just basically decided</i>

37:55.398 --> 37:58.276
<i>we're just going to do exactly</i>
<i>what he looks like in the comics.</i>

37:58.359 --> 38:03.781
<i>Picked the picture and the magicians that</i>
<i>work on this movie just figured it out.</i>

38:10.746 --> 38:13.291
<i>This costume is a little different</i>
<i>from the one we had before.</i>

38:13.374 --> 38:14.625
It's less shiny.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.794
Yeah, it's less sparkly.

38:17.211 --> 38:20.131
I don't have the same drip
that I had in the other ones.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.008
Maybe these two are our chance.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.259
To be remembered.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.677
The way we deserve.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.803
An ending.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.096
Legacy.

38:27.888 --> 38:32.601
[Garner] <i>A lot of superheroes wear red,</i>
<i>but, of course, Deadpool is in red.</i>

38:32.685 --> 38:37.148
So Elektra's gone a bit more berry
like a gray berry, which I love.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.900
<i>So it's a different costume,</i>
<i>a lot less skin.</i>

38:40.234 --> 38:42.903
Elektra always had a lot more
midriff showing,

38:42.987 --> 38:45.239
which... we wouldn't need that now.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.742
That's not necessary.
Elektra's had three kids.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.328
<i>Those characters are all</i>
<i>really, really important,</i>

38:50.411 --> 38:52.872
<i>and some of my favorite moments</i>
<i>in the movie</i>

38:52.955 --> 38:55.166
are standing shoulder to shoulder
with those guys.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.793
<i>And they were amazing</i>
<i>because we had six and a half usable hours</i>

38:57.877 --> 38:59.253
<i>of daylight each and every day.</i>

38:59.337 --> 39:02.465
And I remember sitting with them
in my trailer before we shot,

39:02.548 --> 39:05.384
and I said, "I'm gonna ask you guys
something that I would...

39:05.468 --> 39:06.886
"I feel sheepish asking you,

39:06.969 --> 39:09.430
"but unless
you have to go to the bathroom,

39:09.513 --> 39:11.098
"can everyone just stay on set?

39:11.182 --> 39:14.435
"Because, man, we need to
go, go, go and not stop!"

39:14.518 --> 39:16.854
And every one of them
was just incredible about that.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.316
<i>They stayed on set and were just ready</i>
<i>to go and stretched out</i>

39:20.399 --> 39:23.402
<i>and primed to do the action</i>
<i>at a moment's notice.</i>

39:24.612 --> 39:27.406
Shawn and Ryan have dreamed of this moment

39:27.490 --> 39:30.201
<i>of all of us coming together</i>
<i>to fight for them</i>

39:30.284 --> 39:32.495
<i>and help them accomplish their goals.</i>

39:32.578 --> 39:35.247
<i>And to watch Shawn and Ryan</i>

39:35.331 --> 39:40.211
<i>get so excited about their dream</i>
<i>becoming a reality in front of their eyes</i>

39:40.294 --> 39:41.962
<i>is really awesome.</i>

39:42.671 --> 39:44.340
- Cut.
- Yeah!

39:44.423 --> 39:47.635
We have waited so long for it
and I'm so grateful.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.220
And it was everything we dreamed of.

39:49.303 --> 39:51.180
It was more than everything we dreamed of,

39:51.263 --> 39:54.225
like, literally 50 times better
than I ever dreamed.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.228
- Well done, well done.
- [Garner] Oh, my goodness.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.235
[Levy] <i>We are in Ant-Man Arena,</i>

40:04.318 --> 40:09.115
as we affectionately call
Cassandra Nova's hideout.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.242
<i>Her fortress. Her compound.</i>

40:11.367 --> 40:13.994
<i>This is a giant Ant-Man</i>

40:14.078 --> 40:17.706
<i>that is half-buried</i>
<i>in the desert of the Void,</i>

40:17.790 --> 40:22.878
<i>and within its skeletal arms,</i>
<i>Cassandra Nova has set up camp.</i>

40:23.295 --> 40:25.256
[Corrin] <i>They built the entire arena,</i>

40:25.339 --> 40:27.550
<i>and there were the vehicles</i>
<i>that actually worked</i>

40:27.633 --> 40:30.636
<i>and the ramp that turns into steps</i>
<i>that I first come down.</i>

40:30.719 --> 40:33.264
It was all there and all functional.
It was mind-blowing.

40:33.347 --> 40:35.933
"Right there, in the amphitheater
of his arms."

40:36.058 --> 40:37.309
That's this set.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.436
- What?
- Yeah.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.230
[Levy] <i>The very notion</i>
<i>that Cassandra's compound</i>

40:41.313 --> 40:44.650
<i>would be in a giant Ant-Man skeleton.</i>

40:44.775 --> 40:50.614
<i>That was in a first draft of this script,</i>
<i>and it was such a weird arbitrary, random,</i>

40:50.698 --> 40:54.452
idiosyncratic, messed-up, cool idea,

40:54.535 --> 40:57.413
because it's so weird, that it stuck.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.463
Obviously, I start with giant Ant-Man
from the costume department.

41:05.546 --> 41:09.800
We scanned the costume,
and then we've magnified the armor.

41:09.884 --> 41:12.928
<i>So we replicated his costume</i>
<i>exponentially.</i>

41:16.474 --> 41:19.977
Just even, just to give
the arena some interest.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.271
<i>I pitched this idea to Shawn</i>
<i>back in the day</i>

41:22.354 --> 41:25.483
<i>almost like when Mad Max first entered</i>
<i>Tina Turner's Thunderdome</i>

41:25.566 --> 41:28.194
<i>and you had</i>
<i>all of these henchmen screaming.</i>

41:28.277 --> 41:29.778
We have the meats!

41:29.862 --> 41:33.240
[Chan] <i>So we embraced</i>
<i>an internal structure within the arms</i>

41:33.324 --> 41:35.618
<i>so you could have multi levels</i>
<i>and framework</i>

41:35.701 --> 41:37.077
<i>for the camera to pass behind</i>

41:37.161 --> 41:40.372
<i>and make the third act final sequence</i>
<i>in there much more interesting.</i>

41:40.456 --> 41:41.874
I mean, it's just powerful.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.042
One more.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.835
[Chan] <i>Even the vehicles.</i>

41:44.919 --> 41:47.505
<i>The brief was to come up</i>
<i>with this caravan of vehicles.</i>

41:47.588 --> 41:50.716
<i>I sort of riffed off the idea</i>
<i>of things being jettisoned</i>

41:50.799 --> 41:54.595
<i>or dropped into the Void</i>
<i>that I could make a hybrid of</i>

41:54.970 --> 41:57.890
<i>Marvel established vehicles</i>
<i>and call them variants</i>

41:57.973 --> 41:59.850
<i>and then just changing them slightly.</i>

42:03.938 --> 42:05.564
[Levy] <i>When you're a director,</i>

42:05.648 --> 42:08.609
<i>shots come to you</i>
<i>one of two ways in my experience.</i>

42:08.692 --> 42:10.528
Sometimes you walk on the set

42:10.611 --> 42:14.782
and the shots come hard
and you've got to kind of walk around

42:14.865 --> 42:16.242
and work to picture it.

42:16.325 --> 42:20.663
<i>When a set is rich in detail,</i>
<i>depth, texture</i>

42:21.163 --> 42:24.333
<i>in the way that this is,</i>
<i>the shots come easy.</i>

42:24.416 --> 42:30.965
And so my biggest stress today
is having the time to do all of the shots

42:31.048 --> 42:33.842
that are inspired by this incredible set.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.427
And the fact that we built it for real,

42:35.511 --> 42:38.430
<i>because once again,</i>
<i>the whole approach with this movie</i>

42:38.514 --> 42:42.560
<i>is practical locations, real builds,</i>
<i>so that you, as an audience,</i>

42:42.643 --> 42:44.937
<i>feel like you're watching</i>
<i>and experiencing something real.</i>

42:50.025 --> 42:51.735
- [groaning]
- [exclaiming]

42:51.819 --> 42:55.364
[Deadpool groaning] That feels like a Kia.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.870
[Jacobson] <i>Today, we are on what we call</i>
<i>the New York Street.</i>

43:01.954 --> 43:05.374
But neither <i>Deadpool</i> movie ever declares
whether Deadpool lives in New York

43:05.457 --> 43:07.084
and there are a lot of shots of Vancouver.

43:07.167 --> 43:11.422
<i>So this is kind of an ND urban street</i>
<i>where Deadpool lives.</i>

43:11.797 --> 43:18.262
We have built this city street here
on the back lot of Pinewood in London,

43:18.345 --> 43:23.225
<i>and I'm kind of astonished by the level</i>
<i>of authenticity and the details.</i>

43:23.309 --> 43:28.439
For instance,
putting in metal plates into the street.

43:28.814 --> 43:32.610
There's no reason for that,
other than the fact that those details,

43:32.693 --> 43:37.615
the filth that accumulates on the curb...
all these little details

43:37.698 --> 43:42.328
all these little details that allow us
to feel like we're in that world.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.873
<i>Why did we build this world?</i>
<i>You might ask.</i>

43:45.956 --> 43:50.127
<i>Because Wade lives</i>
<i>in a nondescript North American city</i>

43:50.210 --> 43:51.837
and we're filming in the UK,

43:51.920 --> 43:53.464
but also because this sequence

43:53.547 --> 43:55.633
that we're filming over
the next couple of weeks,

43:55.716 --> 44:01.430
has some of the most spoilery
confidential plot twists

44:01.513 --> 44:02.848
in <i>Deadpool 3.</i>

44:02.931 --> 44:06.935
<i>And we figured that if we go out</i>
<i>when we do it on a real city street,</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:08.604
<i>we'll definitely be photographed.</i>

44:08.687 --> 44:09.938
So here we are.

44:10.230 --> 44:14.526
We're set and background... Action!

44:17.321 --> 44:22.826
On this backlot set, we were sort of
shoehorned into the only available space.

44:22.910 --> 44:26.455
<i>That dictated</i>
<i>the square footage of our set build,</i>

44:26.538 --> 44:28.290
<i>which informed the layout, ultimately,</i>

44:28.374 --> 44:32.711
<i>because George, the DP, had an opinion</i>
<i>on the sun direction and the sun path.</i>

44:32.795 --> 44:37.049
<i>So we were already working</i>
<i>with an existing space,</i>

44:37.132 --> 44:41.011
<i>plus the sun path</i>
<i>dictated the skeleton of the set.</i>

44:41.095 --> 44:42.638
<i>But then I decided, "Right, okay,</i>

44:42.721 --> 44:45.432
"Let's make one end more interesting."

44:45.516 --> 44:49.478
And I look back at <i>The Warriors,</i>
and I imagine this whole scene

44:49.561 --> 44:53.273
<i>where the Deadpool Corps</i>
<i>were coming from every single street.</i>

44:53.357 --> 44:56.777
<i>And so that's hence Five Points,</i>
<i>what we call Five Points,</i>

44:56.860 --> 44:58.696
<i>that's how Five Points was born.</i>

44:59.530 --> 45:02.491
[Reynolds] Hey, guys, looking good.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.119
Deadpool Prime here.

45:06.286 --> 45:07.788
Can we just be done?

45:16.004 --> 45:21.093
When Ryan first asked me
to direct this <i>Deadpool,</i>

45:21.176 --> 45:25.055
I started by reading
a shitload of the comics.

45:25.139 --> 45:27.307
<i>And the Corps, the Deadpool Corps</i>

45:27.391 --> 45:30.394
<i>was such an early</i>
<i>and compelling idea to me.</i>

45:30.477 --> 45:33.105
And I really wanted to find
a way to integrate them

45:33.188 --> 45:37.109
into what would become
this and my <i>Deadpool</i> movie.

45:37.484 --> 45:41.405
So they're walking, walking,
and when we hear, "Hold!" they all stop.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.365
Hold!

45:43.449 --> 45:45.701
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

45:45.784 --> 45:50.164
We started off with Nicepool,
which was Ryan's alter ego.

45:50.247 --> 45:52.166
<i>That's the first thing that we worked on.</i>

45:53.083 --> 45:56.754
He is just this sort of
more bucked-up version.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.840
<i>A more beautiful version of Deadpool.</i>

45:59.923 --> 46:01.049
Where's your mask?

46:01.133 --> 46:02.634
You guys are seeing this, right?

46:02.718 --> 46:06.346
<i>And he's got these long flowing locks,</i>
<i>and he's sort of a Zen character.</i>

46:06.430 --> 46:09.600
I'm so sorry about that.
This place is beautiful.

46:09.975 --> 46:12.102
<i>Boy, do I love playing Nicepool.</i>

46:12.186 --> 46:15.856
He's just so manufactured and so nice

46:15.939 --> 46:20.027
that by the time his head
is just blown clean off of his body,

46:20.110 --> 46:22.196
you're breathing a slight sigh of relief.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.948
I have low bone density,
and I have to keep my face safe.

46:25.032 --> 46:30.579
He's like the box fresh,
"20% better than normal" Deadpool.

46:30.662 --> 46:35.542
<i>So he's got all the full chrome,</i>
<i>gold-plated everything. Shiny inserts.</i>

46:35.626 --> 46:39.046
Are those gold-plated,
.50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.214
[Nicepool] 'Course.

46:41.507 --> 46:42.674
To match my ear huggie.

46:42.758 --> 46:43.842
Everything is bespoke.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.012
There's nothing on his suit
that did exist before this.

46:47.095 --> 46:50.516
<i>Even the material is screen-printed.</i>

46:50.599 --> 46:54.937
<i>Everything's painted, covered,</i>
<i>made from scratch.</i>

46:55.020 --> 46:58.398
Within the costume department,
we've made 30 variants,

46:58.482 --> 47:02.444
and then we've made
lots of specialist variants like 2099.

47:02.528 --> 47:05.739
<i>We made Ladypool, Zenpool, Cowboypool.</i>

47:05.823 --> 47:08.158
[Jacobson] <i>Kidpool, Headpool and Dogpool.</i>

47:08.242 --> 47:11.662
And then from there, we just let
everyone's imagination run wild.

47:11.745 --> 47:12.955
Dogpool is one of my favorites.

47:13.038 --> 47:15.874
<i>We did a search for the ugliest dog</i>
<i>in the world, and sure enough,</i>

47:15.958 --> 47:18.252
<i>there was Peggy, in the UK,</i>
<i>where we were shooting.</i>

47:18.335 --> 47:20.295
<i>I love where inspiration</i>
<i>can come out of nowhere.</i>

47:20.379 --> 47:24.967
I was watching some horrible show
about fairies with my 6-year-old,

47:25.050 --> 47:28.720
and there was a character with these
goggles, a fairy with these googles,

47:28.804 --> 47:32.224
and these huge magnified eyes
inside the goggles.

47:32.307 --> 47:36.019
So I remember seeing it and freaking out
and taking a video of it,

47:36.103 --> 47:38.146
sending it to our
visual effects supervisors,

47:38.230 --> 47:40.315
Swen Gillberg and Lisa Marra, and saying,

47:40.399 --> 47:42.526
<i>"In the third act when Dogpool comes back,</i>

47:42.609 --> 47:45.279
<i>"can we put goggles on Dogpool</i>

47:45.362 --> 47:49.950
<i>"but make them look like they are</i>
<i>the most intense prescription ever?"</i>

47:50.033 --> 47:52.828
<i>And they said, "Yes, we could,</i>
<i>but it's going to cost a lot of money."</i>

47:52.911 --> 47:54.997
I did mention this is our Baby Yoda.

47:57.624 --> 47:58.834
Sweet little puppy.

48:01.587 --> 48:03.213
[Levy] <i>What's so fun about today is,</i>

48:03.297 --> 48:06.550
because I've been working for
the last two months with Rob Simonsen

48:06.633 --> 48:08.844
on the score to this movie,

48:08.927 --> 48:14.683
I'm playing the score and the Deadpool
theme that's been written for this movie

48:14.766 --> 48:16.226
while we're shooting this movie,

48:17.019 --> 48:19.605
<i>and in turn, it's giving the actors</i>
<i>and the performers</i>

48:19.688 --> 48:21.815
<i>a visceral sense of the vibe</i>

48:21.899 --> 48:25.235
<i>and just the bad-ass attitude</i>
<i>of this Deadpool Corps.</i>

48:26.278 --> 48:30.115
Deadpool, musically, can be
the most irreverent,

48:30.198 --> 48:32.159
and you can lean into superhero moments

48:32.242 --> 48:33.952
but you can also have
a lot of fun with it.

48:35.203 --> 48:39.374
<i>I wanted to give some new looks</i>
<i>with being pretty beat-driven</i>

48:39.458 --> 48:43.211
<i>in some ways, not just using electronics,</i>

48:43.295 --> 48:46.173
<i>but really having big beats</i>
<i>that could really drive it.</i>

48:51.011 --> 48:55.515
<i>Also, orchestral flavors for superhero</i>
<i>stuff that needs to feel like</i>

48:55.599 --> 48:59.937
<i>this is classic Marvel</i>
<i>orchestral superhero fare,</i>

49:00.020 --> 49:04.900
because a lot of it is Deadpool's
imagining of himself

49:04.983 --> 49:06.401
in the Marvel Universe.

49:06.485 --> 49:11.031
So the perspective of the score
is often from Deadpool's perspective

49:11.114 --> 49:14.493
of how he feels as he's getting
into the Marvel Universe.

49:14.576 --> 49:15.744
Are you ready?

49:16.453 --> 49:17.955
I get to kill a hundred yous?

49:18.038 --> 49:19.331
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

49:23.001 --> 49:24.670
[Cottle] <i>The oner, as we call it,</i>

49:24.753 --> 49:27.381
<i>is something that's been discussed</i>
<i>from very, very early on.</i>

49:27.464 --> 49:30.300
It shouldn't be elemental and sharp.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.386
It should have dancer flow.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.930
I think you can do brutal and flow
at the same time.

49:35.013 --> 49:37.849
- Yeah, I'd love the kills to be brutal.
- Yeah.

49:37.933 --> 49:42.229
Ryan said to me, "I have been
dreaming about this shot for..."

49:42.312 --> 49:44.690
I think he said seven or nine years.

49:44.773 --> 49:49.695
He's like, from the shot, to the framing,
to the song, to the action.

49:49.778 --> 49:52.364
He's like, "We are doing it."
I was, like, "Okay."

49:52.447 --> 49:57.160
We're just gonna shoot and go for it.
So lots of energy. Enjoy it.

49:59.663 --> 50:04.835
[Cottle] <i>When you commit to a oner,</i>
<i>you are committing to what that shot is.</i>

50:04.918 --> 50:07.379
<i>So whenever you shoot</i>
<i>big action sequences,</i>

50:07.462 --> 50:09.256
<i>you're always running a couple of cameras.</i>

50:09.339 --> 50:13.301
<i>You can cut somewhere else</i>
<i>or if a punch misses or if a kick misses,</i>

50:13.385 --> 50:15.345
<i>it's like, "We'll jump</i>
<i>to this camera for that,</i>

50:15.429 --> 50:17.848
<i>"or we'll look at this explosion</i>
<i>for that moment."</i>

50:17.973 --> 50:20.684
<i>But when you do a oner</i>
<i>and you're just there for,</i>

50:20.767 --> 50:23.061
<i>I think it's just over two minutes,</i>

50:23.145 --> 50:24.271
there's nowhere to go.

50:24.354 --> 50:25.689
<i>It was daunting.</i>

50:25.772 --> 50:29.359
[grunting]

50:29.443 --> 50:33.947
One of the stunt guys showed me
a version of the video game from 1995.

50:34.031 --> 50:36.158
He goes, "Look," and it's literally like

50:36.241 --> 50:39.828
Wolverine fighting hundreds of people
and going along in a oner shot,

50:39.911 --> 50:41.413
and I was like, "Who'd have thought?"

50:43.790 --> 50:46.543
[Cottle] <i>The idea behind it</i>
<i>was we were going to shoot it</i>

50:46.626 --> 50:51.423
<i>on a motion-controlled rig,</i>
<i>so we would lock the camera off</i>

50:51.506 --> 50:54.217
<i>and we would do a couple of passes,</i>

50:54.301 --> 50:57.554
<i>and then we would bake</i>
<i>the action into the passes</i>

50:57.637 --> 51:00.015
<i>and then overlay them in passes.</i>

51:00.098 --> 51:04.811
<i>But all the action would be practical</i>
<i>in camera</i>

51:04.895 --> 51:08.315
and then we would just
have to work out how we would layer in

51:08.398 --> 51:10.358
the next layer of stunt people.

51:10.442 --> 51:15.322
Can you now mix what we just shot
with our hero from Section 3, please?

51:15.405 --> 51:21.536
The only thing was that
we only had a three-hour window a day

51:21.620 --> 51:24.915
where the light would be
in the correct position to make it work.

51:24.998 --> 51:28.752
<i>So our gameplan was to turn up</i>
<i>at 7:00 a.m. Still pitch black.</i>

51:28.835 --> 51:31.129
We would rehearse from 7:00 till 10:00.

51:31.213 --> 51:32.547
We would take an early lunch,

51:32.631 --> 51:37.219
<i>we'd then take an hour to get</i>
<i>all the stunties ready as Deadpools.</i>

51:37.302 --> 51:41.431
<i>And then we would shoot</i>
<i>from 11:30 till 2:30, I think,</i>

51:41.515 --> 51:43.934
and we would just get Section 1 one day.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.769
And then once we'd got that section,

51:45.852 --> 51:48.313
<i>we'd spend the rest of the day</i>
<i>rehearsing for the next day,</i>

51:48.772 --> 51:50.649
<i>come in, and then it just went on</i>
<i>like that.</i>

51:50.732 --> 51:53.318
Oh, there you go. Wow!

51:53.401 --> 51:55.904
Yes! Yes, we got it.

51:55.987 --> 51:57.864
I've been doing this for a long time.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.616
I enjoy the challenge.

51:59.699 --> 52:01.118
I enjoy the mental challenge

52:01.952 --> 52:05.413
of working with so many
different stunt performers,

52:05.497 --> 52:08.416
doing choreography,
having the camera there

52:08.500 --> 52:11.419
and trying to do a shot
that I'd never done before.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.130
And it was a challenge that I loved.

52:13.213 --> 52:14.339
- Yeah!
- [cheers and applause]

52:14.422 --> 52:16.174
Really well done.

52:17.634 --> 52:19.678
I feel really good about that.

52:20.137 --> 52:23.431
Zombies, get up!

52:23.515 --> 52:25.100
- [baby giggling]
- [groaning]

52:25.183 --> 52:26.768
I guess these ones regenerate.

52:26.852 --> 52:28.019
[Peter] Deadpools!

52:28.103 --> 52:29.271
Stand down.

52:30.188 --> 52:31.940
I loved Peter in <i>Deadpool 2,</i>

52:32.023 --> 52:35.819
so the idea was not just
having him in our movie,

52:35.902 --> 52:39.197
<i>but we knew we wanted him</i>
<i>to play a critical role.</i>

52:40.115 --> 52:42.784
[Delaney] <i>Peter in the suit is insane,</i>

52:42.868 --> 52:47.497
<i>and it's as insane</i>
<i>as me trying to literally put on a suit</i>

52:47.581 --> 52:50.041
that had previously
been worn by Ryan Reynolds.

52:50.125 --> 52:54.045
Because... [chuckles]
our bodies are different shapes.

52:54.129 --> 52:58.175
<i>One thing that was nice is that</i>
<i>when I first met Shawn, the director,</i>

52:58.258 --> 53:01.511
he was, like,
"Oh, no. I thought you were fatter."

53:01.595 --> 53:03.346
And so that was nice to hear.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.849
<i>So they did have to make a fat suit.</i>

53:05.932 --> 53:07.767
<i>And at first they overdid it.</i>

53:07.851 --> 53:10.770
And people were like, "No, God, no,
it's not absurd." You know?

53:10.854 --> 53:13.398
And so they had to shave it down.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.817
I'm the pudgy, middle-aged guy
in orthopedic sandals

53:15.901 --> 53:18.361
who looks in the mirror
and sees something more.

53:19.738 --> 53:23.033
I see a guy who shows up
for a mother-fudging friend.

53:23.116 --> 53:25.368
[Reynolds] <i>He just embodies just this</i>

53:25.452 --> 53:28.371
<i>sort of Ned Flanders</i>
<i>everyman kind of thing.</i>

53:28.455 --> 53:34.294
But Rob himself is actually
incredibly subversive and dark as fuck.

53:34.377 --> 53:37.714
<i>So he's kind of always</i>
<i>a fun character to play with</i>

53:37.797 --> 53:39.424
<i>and a fun character to write</i>

53:39.507 --> 53:42.010
<i>because he embraces those weird,</i>
<i>subversive things.</i>

53:42.636 --> 53:45.889
Peter isn't somebody
that was born in the comic books

53:45.972 --> 53:48.892
that people have been saying,
"Hey, I wonder when we'll see Peter."

53:48.975 --> 53:50.894
<i>He's just sort of an original thing,</i>

53:50.977 --> 53:55.523
but now he's kind of, I don't know,
backed up into the Marvel Universe.

53:55.607 --> 53:58.735
Sort of reverse-engineered,
so that's pretty cool.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.737
[all chanting] Peter. Peter. Peter.

54:03.490 --> 54:06.034
[Delaney] <i>So when you say he's part of</i>
<i>the Marvel Cinematic Universe,</i>

54:06.117 --> 54:09.246
<i>you're not lying, which is really strange.</i>

54:09.329 --> 54:10.705
Enjoy my Peter.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.921
So the power room is where
the big finale happens.

54:18.964 --> 54:22.384
[Reynolds] <i>Ray created a world</i>
<i>unlike anything I've ever seen.</i>

54:22.467 --> 54:25.679
He just kind of invented things
that were just second to none.

54:25.762 --> 54:30.475
The set is shot mostly practically
with all the effects built in.

54:30.558 --> 54:35.814
<i>There's water involved.</i>
<i>There's vortexes and electricity and fire.</i>

54:35.897 --> 54:40.151
Third act Marvel money splooge, activate!

54:40.235 --> 54:43.655
The power room
was a 1905 ventilation shaft,

54:44.114 --> 54:48.368
<i>an abandoned condemned space,</i>
<i>which the TVA then commandeered</i>

54:48.451 --> 54:52.998
<i>and retrofitted</i>
<i>the power source, the plasma core</i>

54:53.081 --> 54:54.165
<i>and the anti-plasma.</i>

54:56.084 --> 54:58.336
The Time Ripper, I was speechless.

54:58.837 --> 55:00.714
<i>They've made these arm gauntlets.</i>

55:00.797 --> 55:05.844
I put my arms in and they're
properly heavy and they've, everything,

55:05.927 --> 55:08.346
every bit of light and wiring

55:08.430 --> 55:10.098
and nut and bolt and screw is like...

55:10.181 --> 55:11.182
Yeah, it's incredible.

55:12.058 --> 55:15.645
[Chan] <i>I probably had about 20 different</i>
<i>concept designs for this.</i>

55:15.729 --> 55:20.567
In my head, the Ripper combines the two
plasmas into this huge atomic bomb.

55:24.946 --> 55:26.406
I don't understand.

55:26.489 --> 55:27.782
How are you two still alive?

55:27.866 --> 55:29.909
You were right.
One of us would have been killed.

55:30.285 --> 55:33.121
But you put
a Deadpool and a Wolverine together...

55:33.204 --> 55:35.582
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

55:35.665 --> 55:37.667
indestructible, motherfucker.

55:39.669 --> 55:41.963
When you approach the end
of a long movie shoot,

55:42.047 --> 55:43.381
you're so tired.

55:43.465 --> 55:44.841
<i>You're so tired.</i>

55:44.924 --> 55:46.593
<i>Your body is so unhealthy.</i>

55:46.676 --> 55:50.972
<i>Your brain is so exhausted</i>
<i>that, quite frankly,</i>

55:51.056 --> 55:54.100
<i>you're kind of looking forward</i>
<i>to getting back to your regular life.</i>

55:54.184 --> 55:57.645
<i>But on this movie,</i>
<i>it's a really ambivalent ending</i>

55:58.271 --> 56:00.899
<i>because I've gotten to come to work,</i>

56:01.566 --> 56:06.738
<i>be around and collaborate with</i>
<i>my two actual best buddies for months.</i>

56:06.821 --> 56:10.992
This is a sign of true love,
that I'm letting someone other than me

56:11.076 --> 56:14.371
cross off the storyboard panels
that we've completed.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.040
This is real brotherhood right here.

56:17.123 --> 56:19.167
<i>I've been making this movie</i>
<i>for almost a year.</i>

56:19.250 --> 56:23.171
<i>I've been developing this movie with Ryan</i>
<i>for two years.</i>

56:23.880 --> 56:25.215
<i>It's a long road to walk</i>

56:25.298 --> 56:28.718
<i>and I never take for granted</i>
<i>that I'm walking it alongside brothers.</i>

56:30.178 --> 56:32.472
Quite often you look back on a job.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.975
It may even be years after,
and you realize how lucky you were.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.228
<i>I knew this before we went in.</i>

56:38.812 --> 56:40.230
<i>I knew it on day one.</i>

56:41.231 --> 56:44.567
<i>There's a photo of the three of us</i>
<i>together taken on the very first day.</i>

56:44.651 --> 56:46.361
<i>That was my wrap gift to both of them.</i>

56:46.444 --> 56:49.948
<i>We knew that</i>
<i>for the next 70 days of filming,</i>

56:50.031 --> 56:51.282
<i>or however many months,</i>

56:51.366 --> 56:54.869
<i>that we were getting</i>
<i>to do our dream characters</i>

56:55.453 --> 56:57.205
<i>with our dream collaborators,</i>

56:57.288 --> 57:00.792
<i>dream crew with a dream story and film.</i>

57:01.501 --> 57:03.253
<i>It felt like there was a destiny to it.</i>

57:03.628 --> 57:07.882
<i>It felt like it was always meant to be,</i>
<i>and we savored it.</i>

57:07.966 --> 57:12.929
And I have never been so happy to wake up
in the morning and go to a set in my life.

57:13.012 --> 57:15.557
- We have SAG cards now.
- [laughter]

57:15.640 --> 57:16.641
Thank you.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.520
[Reynolds] <i>Any movie where you, you know,</i>
<i>you get friends together</i>

57:20.603 --> 57:22.272
that know each other very well,

57:22.355 --> 57:24.441
you're kind of born on third base.

57:24.524 --> 57:28.486
<i>No movie's ever exemplified that for me</i>
<i>more than</i> Deadpool & Wolverine.

57:28.570 --> 57:29.612
And it was beautiful.

57:29.696 --> 57:32.073
I get why he did
10 of these fucking movies.

57:32.699 --> 57:36.453
[Levy] <i>There's this line</i>
<i>that Ryan and I wrote,</i>

57:36.536 --> 57:39.706
<i>in one of the final scenes</i>
<i>between Wolverine and Deadpool.</i>

57:39.789 --> 57:42.208
<i>And Deadpool says to Wolvie,</i>

57:42.292 --> 57:45.253
"Hey, I waited a long time
for this team-up.

57:46.671 --> 57:49.299
<i>"And I'll tell you something.</i>
<i>It was worth the wait."</i>
