[steady buzzing]

01:04.606 --> 01:06.608
[clattering]

01:07.734 --> 01:10.236
[indistinct announcement on PA]

01:23.833 --> 01:27.670
Did you experience any pain or cramping
before the bleeding began?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.255
[Eva] Uh, yes.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.341
A little.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.635
-[doctor] Do you have an OB?
-Yeah.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.053
Did you call them?

01:35.136 --> 01:37.305
Uh, no, I've been traveling.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.973
I'm so sorry.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.560
You know, first trimester miscarriages
are not uncommon.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.396
-Many women experience them.
-[sighs] I know that.

01:46.856 --> 01:47.941
It's not your first?

01:50.652 --> 01:52.487
How many miscarriages have you had?

01:54.697 --> 01:55.698
Mrs. Geller.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.159
It is Mrs., right?

01:59.410 --> 02:01.412
I need to know your medical history

02:01.496 --> 02:03.748
-in order to process--
-This is my fourth.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.166
Okay.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.168
What medications are you on?

02:09.420 --> 02:10.463
Mrs. Geller.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.215
Endometrin.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.843
-Injections or pills?
-Injections.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.887
Okay. So you're on a fertility program?

02:19.722 --> 02:22.433
Is your husband outside?
Do you want him to come in?

02:23.059 --> 02:23.977
No.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.687
Do you need to call him?

02:28.940 --> 02:29.941
He's dead.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.197
He banked his sperm
before his chemo treatments.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.117
I'm sorry.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.453
Do I need a D and C?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.164
It's not likely.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.875
-At this early stage of--
-Can I go, then?

02:47.625 --> 02:51.212
We need you to stick around
for a few hours for observation.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.255
[Eva sighs]

02:52.338 --> 02:54.674
-Do you have a friend you can call?
-No, I'm...

02:55.216 --> 02:56.342
I'm fine, thank you.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.679
Okay.

03:01.014 --> 03:05.602
[man on PA]
<i>Dr Montel to the chem lab, please.</i>

03:35.423 --> 03:37.884
[woman] <i>This is an important case</i>
<i>for the ACLU.</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:41.304
<i>We're gonna make sure that it gets</i>
<i>the right amount of attention.</i>

03:42.805 --> 03:45.516
The judge will likely uphold the charge
of illegal entry,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.352
recommend that you be removed.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.021
We'll apply for relief
so that you're not deported.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.398
You'll probably be denied bail
and detained

03:52.482 --> 03:54.400
while we await your proper hearing.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.612
Do you understand everything I'm saying?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.072
Yes.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.116
I'm the best at what I do,
and I'm gonna win this for you.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.327
God willing.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.747
God willing or not.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.794
-[buzz of conversation]
-[Anna] Listen to me...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.463
[man 1] OK. Should be out of here
in three to five.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.924
-[Anna] Go on, take a sip.
-[man 2] I shouldn't have left her.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.301
I shouldn't have left her alone.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.388
-[man 1] Take that...
-[man 3] Right there...

04:23.471 --> 04:25.473
[radio chatter]

04:27.433 --> 04:29.769
[man 1] Right now, ma'am!
Out of there!

04:30.603 --> 04:31.813
There you go!

04:35.358 --> 04:38.319
-We're clearin' out...
-I'll grab it now, put it on through.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.115
-[woman] Thank you, Reverend.
-You're welcome. God bless.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.367
[man 1] Turn it on on three. That's right.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.620
[man 2] Give me some motion,
you know what I'm sayin'?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.421
[woman] Excuse me.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.214
Hey.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.758
Do you know where we can set up camp?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.803
[Felix] You're not local.
Where are you from?

05:03.886 --> 05:04.804
Austin.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.848
Is this it?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.018
-Is this where it happened?
-Where what happened?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.979
Where the Miracle Man appeared.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.606
-Yes.
-Ah!

05:21.738 --> 05:24.032
-What are you doin'?
-I'm posting it.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.742
People want to know.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.951
People are coming.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.786
Thank you.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.832
[helicopter flying overhead]

05:39.297 --> 05:40.256
[coughs]

05:47.555 --> 05:49.474
[man on radio] <i>Yeah, I'm over here, uh...</i>

05:49.557 --> 05:52.685
<i>going to wait a couple more minutes, so...</i>

05:55.104 --> 05:56.773
[coughing]

05:59.317 --> 06:01.736
<i>Uh, level B, Charlie, going down now...</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:08.326
[phone notifications]

06:15.750 --> 06:17.752

-[phone chiming]

06:21.422 --> 06:22.256
Geller.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.009
<i>It's, uh... Will... Mathers.</i>

06:25.802 --> 06:26.636
Yes.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.097
<i>-I think we got off on the wrong foot.</i>
-Uh-huh.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.560
<i>-Is that all you wanted to say?</i>
-Well, pretty much.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.063
<i>That, and...</i>

06:37.647 --> 06:41.651
his lawyer just left for the day,
so if you were thinkin' about comin' in...

06:42.735 --> 06:44.153
I'll be there in 45.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.591
[thunder rumbling]

07:16.853 --> 07:17.770
[Eva] Where is he?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.190
I've put him in a holding cell.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.609
He was most obliging
without his lawyer present.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.821
Thought you were by the book?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.657
No rules being broken here.

07:30.616 --> 07:31.868
Just a little bent.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.413
You good?

07:37.832 --> 07:38.791
Yeah.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.481
[door creaks and closes]

08:06.027 --> 08:06.986
Hello.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.572
Hello.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.199
Are they treating you okay?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.244
Yes, thank you.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.257
You have questions for me?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.842
No, I just want to talk.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.639
I'm what you might call a follower...

08:35.515 --> 08:38.351
of yours, as in,
I have been following you.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.230
Syria, Israel, Jordan, Mexico.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.857
-You're CIA.
-You get around.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.526
It's the nature of my work.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.362
And what is that work?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.280
God's work.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.658
And God wants you here?

08:54.492 --> 08:56.911
-In a Texas detention center?
-[thunder rumbling]

08:57.328 --> 08:58.162
For now.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.080
Hm.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.249
Planning on another breakout?

09:02.750 --> 09:03.960
It's not up to me.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.382
Must be a comfort to know
that whatever it is you do...

09:10.424 --> 09:12.510
-it's God's will.
-To the contrary.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.389
It's a great responsibility.
He doesn't ask easy things.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.599
Responsibility?

09:19.976 --> 09:23.521
You feel responsibility
for the hundreds of women and children

09:23.604 --> 09:27.149
that you led to a border of a country
that is never going to let them in?

09:28.025 --> 09:30.194
No one can question God's will.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.154
Oh, I'm not questioning God's.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.490
I'm questioning yours.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.160
You're the one who led them there.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.413
Before too long,
people are gonna start dying.

09:40.496 --> 09:43.124
And that will be on your head.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.879
You've made yourself a lot of enemies.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.465
Speaking the truth often has that effect.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.466
Truth?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.385
We'll get to the truth.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.429
Yes.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.473
Good.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.144
The more you cooperate,
the more I can help you.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.605
I don't need your help. God provides.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.649
You know, maybe...

10:09.150 --> 10:11.444
I'm a part of God's plan.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.863
-You are.
-Huh.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.074
So...

10:17.867 --> 10:19.910
tell me what that plan <i>is.</i>

10:21.871 --> 10:22.830
Enlighten me.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.667
I wish it were that simple.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.835
[Eva chuckles]

10:27.918 --> 10:29.295
But it never is.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.422
Is it?

10:31.505 --> 10:35.301
It's always an idea
that's just out of reach.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.181
And people just need to trust in you
and follow you.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.476
You know, my job, I...

10:44.477 --> 10:49.690
I meet people like you all the time,
people who think they have the answer,

10:51.025 --> 10:54.403
if only the world would listen to them
and do as they say.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.616
They become so committed to an idea,
they distort themselves.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.036
They become the embodiment
of that ideal and...

11:03.329 --> 11:05.331
it makes them feel special.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.376
For a while.

11:10.461 --> 11:14.215
But sooner or later, all of these people,
deep down, they...

11:14.965 --> 11:16.717
all want it to stop.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.012
They miss being human.

11:22.056 --> 11:25.851
But they feel they have no choice
but to continue what they started,

11:25.935 --> 11:27.478
isolating themselves...

11:28.020 --> 11:29.897
cutting off from friends and family,

11:29.980 --> 11:33.609
and getting further and further away
from what they know...

11:34.944 --> 11:38.698
till there's no choice
but to go over the cliff.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.909
And that's what makes people like you...

11:43.077 --> 11:44.036
dangerous.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.249
To everyone, including yourself.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.961
My job...

11:54.839 --> 11:56.507
My job is to catch you...

11:57.383 --> 11:58.759
before that cliff.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.223
Catchers in the rye.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.018
What was that?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.772
We're both catchers in the rye...

12:12.648 --> 12:13.649
you and me.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.571
Trying to stop the children from falling.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.541
You are very devoted to your job.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.793
Why do you say that?

12:32.877 --> 12:33.878
It's Sunday.

12:36.046 --> 12:39.633
You are a woman who has fought hard
for everything she has.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.138
Fought hard to be recognized,
to be the best...

12:44.805 --> 12:46.015
to stand out...

12:46.640 --> 12:49.268
to be better than the men around her.

12:49.351 --> 12:53.147
-That's every working woman.
-But you're prepared to go the extra mile.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.733
Ignore your personal problems...

12:56.734 --> 12:59.779
and drag yourself here on a Sunday...

13:01.447 --> 13:03.240
It's what you worship.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.577
-Worship?
-Mm.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.330
Everybody worships.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.374
The only choice is what we worship.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.962
Some people kneel to money.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.050
Some to power, to intellect.

13:22.092 --> 13:22.927
And you?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.807
You are an acolyte of the CIA.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.351
And you have sacrificed everything
for an idea.

13:30.434 --> 13:35.189
And the more you've pursued that idea,
the more isolated <i>you've</i> become.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.360
But at night, you lay in bed...

13:41.153 --> 13:44.114
and wonder if it was worth
everything you gave up.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.413
God hears the tears that you won't cry.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.166
You don't know anything about me.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.751
I know you're in pain.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.295
It will not last.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.633
I'm just fine, thank you.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.677
You will be, after it passes.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.561
I can make it pass.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.651
Your accent...

14:21.485 --> 14:22.486
you're from Iran.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.906
Do you have family there, friends?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.245
And you're right.

14:32.371 --> 14:36.667
I am good at my job.
And I'm going to find out everything...

14:37.334 --> 14:40.337
-about you.
-You're looking for the wrong things.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.800
[in Hebrew] "They that seek the Lord
shall not want for good."

14:44.884 --> 14:46.302
Who taught you Hebrew?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.471
-My father.
-You're trying to tell me you're Jewish?

14:50.139 --> 14:52.016
It follows the mother's line.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.393
As you would know.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.397
Just as your mother had you.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.866
She wants you to know
you were her gift from God.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.954
You know nothing about my mother.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.832
She's always watching.

15:20.044 --> 15:20.920
Her...

15:23.339 --> 15:24.340
and your husband.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.512
Eva...

15:32.681 --> 15:33.724
it's okay.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.893
It's okay to cry.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.942
[buzzer sounds]

15:43.025 --> 15:44.276
[gasping]

15:53.285 --> 15:54.536
[buzzer sounds]

15:54.995 --> 15:56.163
Everythin' okay?

15:56.705 --> 15:57.539
[Eva] Yeah.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.166
I'm good.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.835
Did you tell him my name?

16:03.420 --> 16:04.922
-No. Fuck.
-Here.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.092
-I'm gonna have to take him back now.
-Fuck.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.427
I'll be damned. [sighs]

16:36.286 --> 16:38.539
[Eva] <i>And I've been following you.</i>

16:39.206 --> 16:42.334
<i>Syria, Israel, Jordan, Mexico.</i>

16:42.418 --> 16:44.712
-[al-Masih] <i>You're CIA.</i>
<i>-You get around.</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:46.547
<i>It's the nature of my work.</i>

16:48.048 --> 16:49.675
[Eva] <i>And what is that work?</i>

16:52.636 --> 16:53.846
[in Hebrew] I need to close up.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.726
[man] Do you answer your fucking phone?

16:59.226 --> 17:00.769
[groans]

17:00.853 --> 17:04.064
-I was beginning to think you were dead.
-[bartender] I'm closed.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.441
Get him out of here.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.442
Give us a minute.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.946
The boss is pissed...
he's been trying to reach you.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.077
You've been investigated
before... we all have.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.248
He's doing what he has to.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.008
Avi.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.594
What's the matter? Talk to me.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.682
I think I fucked up.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.768
[cicadas chirping]

17:43.562 --> 17:44.438
[car door slams]

17:51.320 --> 17:52.696
What were you thinking?

17:58.744 --> 17:59.870
[Aviram sighs]

18:01.872 --> 18:02.706
[man sighs]

18:05.459 --> 18:06.835
[boy groaning]

18:30.526 --> 18:34.738
[Eva] <i>We need to properly detain him, in</i>
<i>order to get better access, more answers.</i>

18:34.822 --> 18:37.366
He's not under CIA jurisdiction
on US soil.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.408
<i>You know that.</i>

18:38.492 --> 18:41.495
<i>-Israel wants him extradited.</i>
-He's being handled. I'm sure of it.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.163
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

18:43.247 --> 18:46.125
He can read people.
He's smart, ma'am. He's been trained.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.920
-He... he knew things about me.
-<i>What things?</i>

18:50.587 --> 18:51.839
Personal stuff.

18:51.922 --> 18:52.756
<i>Like what?</i>

18:52.840 --> 18:55.717
About my family,
stuff that you'd find in a dossier on me,

18:55.801 --> 18:58.137
say, from a counterintelligence agency
like the GID.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.389
Coupled with the fact
that he escaped Shin Bet,

19:00.472 --> 19:03.684
boarded a private plane in Jordan,
and it starts to paint a picture.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.562
It's a nice theory, but what's his plan?

19:06.645 --> 19:08.647
<i>Well, if he gets extradited,</i>
<i>nobody will know.</i>

19:08.730 --> 19:10.649
<i>If we're gonna detain him,</i>
<i>it has to be now.</i>

19:10.732 --> 19:13.402
<i>-When's the trial?</i>
-Bail hearing's tomorrow.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.530
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

19:17.573 --> 19:18.615
[sighs]

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
[notification pings]

20:40.197 --> 20:41.365
[phone rings]

20:44.993 --> 20:47.246
-Hello?
-[Eva] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

20:48.664 --> 20:49.498
Ruth?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.584
Eva, Dad.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.127
Oh, Eva, that's what I meant.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.462
Uh, what's wrong?

20:55.545 --> 20:57.839
-[sighs] Nothing.
-<i>You sure?</i>

20:59.049 --> 21:01.718
Yes. Why does there always
have to be something wrong?

21:02.177 --> 21:04.930
Because you never call, that's all.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.308
-We speak almost every day.
-Yeah, but you're never the one who calls.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.353
I'm calling you now.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.106
<i>So what's up?</i>

21:16.733 --> 21:18.443
Uh, nothing. I'm just...

21:19.486 --> 21:20.320
checking in.

21:22.781 --> 21:23.615
<i>Dad?</i>

21:24.616 --> 21:25.659
Yeah. Uh...

21:26.535 --> 21:28.036
It's nice that you did.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.663
<i>How are you?</i>

21:32.040 --> 21:33.834
Oh, well, I... I'm good.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.794
<i>I'm gonna try and come see you soon.</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:39.339
<i>So what... what is it?</i>

21:43.593 --> 21:44.553
Nothing.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.929
<i>I miss you.</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:49.141
Work getting you down?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.352
<i>It's okay, Dad.</i>

21:52.436 --> 21:55.272
Hey, you don't...
you don't have to be tough around me.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.316
I know, Dad.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.360
<i>I remember what it was like.</i>

22:01.570 --> 22:03.071
It's a lonely job.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.615
I'm just tired.

22:07.492 --> 22:08.368
Okay.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
I love you.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.707
<i>Me too.</i>

22:25.886 --> 22:26.845
[sighs]

22:26.928 --> 22:28.805
[woman] <i>A spotlight has been shone today</i>

22:28.889 --> 22:31.266
<i>on the president's</i>
<i>federal immigration policies,</i>

22:31.350 --> 22:35.062
<i>as political folk hero</i>
<i>and Syrian refugee al-Masih...</i>

22:35.145 --> 22:37.147
[man] <i>The hearing caught</i>
<i>the attention of lawmakers,</i>

22:37.230 --> 22:39.649
<i>as the ACLU has stepped up</i>
<i>to defend Mr. Masih.</i>

22:39.733 --> 22:43.028
Whether he entered the country illegally
or not is beside the point.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.781
He has rights, and the ACLU is here
to protect those rights.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.990
What about Judge Pleva?

22:47.074 --> 22:50.077
He's a conservative,
known for coming down hard on illegals.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.954
Whatever political or social leanings
Judge Pleva has,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.290
he's obliged to weigh the case
on its own merit.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.920
The federal government
has found the respondent

23:00.003 --> 23:03.590
to be present in the United States
without proper admission,

23:04.049 --> 23:07.135
lacking a visa
or other forms of documentation.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.512
Miss Garcia?

23:10.639 --> 23:14.267
Does the respondent understand
the charges being brought against him?

23:14.351 --> 23:15.560
He does, Your Honor.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.479
And does he admit or deny?

23:17.562 --> 23:20.023
My client admits to the charge
of illegal entry.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.526
However, the defense wishes
to file for protection

23:22.609 --> 23:24.569
under the convention against torture.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.239
Based on what information?

23:27.322 --> 23:30.909
My client fears persecution
for his religious and political beliefs

23:30.992 --> 23:32.661
if he were to be sent back to Israel.

23:32.744 --> 23:33.578
Your Honor?

23:34.579 --> 23:35.414
Ms. Lang?

23:35.872 --> 23:38.125
The United States would like to point out

23:38.208 --> 23:42.045
that the respondent is seen as a person
of interest, having incited rioting

23:42.129 --> 23:45.090
and violence in Israel,
which you've surely seen in the news.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.677
Therefore, the prosecution kindly asks
Your Honor to consider

23:48.760 --> 23:51.054
an expedited removal of Mr. Masih,

23:51.138 --> 23:53.348
which I would like to note
is not his real name--

23:53.432 --> 23:55.892
Your Honor, my client is reluctant
to give his real name

23:55.976 --> 23:58.228
for fear of retaliation
against family members

23:58.311 --> 24:00.689
-he may have back home.
-Seeing as the respondent has fled

24:00.772 --> 24:04.192
a foreign country already,
the court is going to deny bail.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.444
Flight risk.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.656
Having heard Ms. Lang's argument,
and due to the stature of the case,

24:10.157 --> 24:11.533
I'm going to expedite the hearing.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.453
-We're gonna lose him.
-We'll see you all here Wednesday.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.538
-[ACLU lawyer] That gives us no time--
-[gavel bangs]

24:21.251 --> 24:22.377
Shit.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.671
[Bailey] <i>Best you put this to bed now.</i>

24:26.339 --> 24:28.091
What if we offer his lawyer a deal?

24:28.758 --> 24:30.302
<i>The situation's the situation, Eva.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:33.805
You need to concentrate on the West Bank.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.518
[sighs]

24:43.356 --> 24:44.983
[thunder crashing]

24:56.244 --> 24:57.204
I should report you.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.915
You interrogated my client behind my back.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.542
-He agreed to talk to me.
-You violated his right to due process.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.252
Do you even care about your client?

25:05.045 --> 25:06.671
Because right now, he's screwed.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.341
The judge expedited the hearing
to disadvantage you.

25:09.424 --> 25:10.759
You don't think I know that?

25:10.842 --> 25:13.220
The only way you can protect him is
if he gets detained.

25:13.303 --> 25:17.224
-In this country? That's no protection.
-He goes back to Syria, he gets shot.

25:17.307 --> 25:20.352
He goes back to Israel, he gets locked up
for the rest of his life.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.979
Now, your client was happy
to cooperate with me.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.023
-You're the one who's being stubborn.
-Hm.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.317
We're prepared to make a deal.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.277
By offering me a chance
to throw the case.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.363
I'm trying to help you.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.448
Yeah. Thanks,
I'll take my chances in court.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.575
Maybe you want to lose the case?

25:35.659 --> 25:38.370
That way you still get your point
across to the media.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.748
What is he, your sacrificial lamb?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.210
Good night, Detective.

25:46.002 --> 25:46.836
It's Officer.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.922
<i>His actions weren't overtly aggressive.</i>

25:49.005 --> 25:52.551
<i>You could argue he's an activist.</i>
<i>Some people are calling him a prophet.</i>

25:52.634 --> 25:55.428
[man] <i>Or maybe he's a terrorist,</i>
<i>or a religious fanatic.</i>

25:55.512 --> 25:58.390
<i>Why are there only two options?</i>
<i>Because he's Muslim?</i>

25:58.473 --> 26:02.185
<i>A Muslim can only be a terrorist</i>
<i>or a religious extremist?</i>

26:02.852 --> 26:06.731
<i>Why can't he just be an ideologue</i>
<i>or a good old-fashioned charlatan?</i>

26:06.815 --> 26:09.359
<i>I just think we're missing</i>
<i>an important part of the debate here</i>

26:09.442 --> 26:11.444
<i>by focusing solely on provenance.</i>

26:11.861 --> 26:15.782
[man] <i>Whatever he is, and however</i>
<i>he got here, he's our problem now.</i>

26:18.034 --> 26:19.578
[in Hebrew] This is bullshit.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.496
This is serious.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.831
I'm trying to help you.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.584
By forcing me to make a statement?

26:26.042 --> 26:29.129
Without the American here,
just tell me what was on that tape.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.964
[distant siren wailing]

26:31.965 --> 26:33.758
Just give me a goddamn statement.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.094
If you don't, you'll be suspended

26:36.177 --> 26:38.263
and go before the Security Council,
do you want that?

26:39.681 --> 26:41.057
You're threatening my job now?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.268
Take it however you like.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.895
I haven't done anything wrong.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.439
You erased an interrogation tape.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.442
[yells] I've erased a thousand tapes.
You know what goes on in there.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.820
-This is different!
-Because he escaped custody?

26:53.903 --> 26:56.573
Because it's on CNN.
The whole world is watching.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.326
It's not just your job. The Prime
Minister is on my back about this.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.493
Do you understand?

27:02.537 --> 27:03.496
Fuck this.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.459
Whatever you're hiding...

27:08.043 --> 27:09.544
I hope it's worth your career.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.591
Keys and ID.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.477
Avi.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.522
If I were you, I'd get an attorney.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.070

29:58.713 --> 30:00.048
[Anna] What are you doing?

30:17.357 --> 30:19.943
I have to go, Anna.
I have to be with him.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.238
Why?

30:24.364 --> 30:25.615
I can't explain it.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.326
I think he needs me.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.746
You've already retained this man a lawyer.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.499
Don't you think you've done enough?

30:34.582 --> 30:37.585
-You don't understand.
-No, I don't.

30:38.419 --> 30:39.462
Explain.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.466
Explain to me what's been goin' on.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.179
Explain to me what you were gonna do
the morning of the tornado.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.308
What were you gonna do, Felix?

30:54.644 --> 30:56.437
Somethin' stupid.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.483
Say it.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.988
I was tryin' to help us.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.031
No.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.535
You weren't even thinking about us.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.290
I can't keep doing this.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.419
I can't keep silent,
wondering what you're gonna do next.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.337
I know things have been hard

31:21.421 --> 31:24.382
-and we haven't been happy, but--
-But what?

31:26.050 --> 31:28.344
-Now things are gonna change?
-Yes.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.179
Why?

31:31.180 --> 31:32.807
Because of this man?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.020
You don't even know who he is.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.730
I can't explain it, Anna.

31:39.397 --> 31:43.026
But right now, I think... I feel...

31:43.109 --> 31:44.611
that this is important.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.446
He is important.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.407
-Are we not important?
-Yes.

31:49.991 --> 31:50.950
Of course.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.170
I was gonna burn this place down, Anna.

32:05.965 --> 32:06.966
I just...

32:08.426 --> 32:10.261
didn't see the point
of what I was doin' here.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.765
I thought I lost everything.
I thought I lost my faith.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.893
And... right at that moment...

32:18.019 --> 32:20.438
a tornado hits and he shows up.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.609
I know God put this man here at this time
in front of me for a reason.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.362
I don't know what that reason was.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.613
That's up to God.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.742
But I do know that if we have faith...

32:33.201 --> 32:34.744
God will guide us.

32:34.827 --> 32:35.912
I know that.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.689
a highly anticipated trial overseen
by Judge Pleva.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.942
[man] The trial that has caught
the nation's attention is in session...

33:48.026 --> 33:51.320
[woman] ...today in a trial
that is heating up the immigration debate,

33:51.404 --> 33:53.906
not just here in Texas,
but across the country.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.872
[distant siren wailing]

34:01.581 --> 34:04.751

Judge Harold Pleva.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.923

34:17.430 --> 34:18.890
[Pleva] Please be seated.

34:20.433 --> 34:24.729
Miss Garcia, I received your necessary
applications last night.

34:25.521 --> 34:28.357
What evidence does the respondent
wish to present?

34:30.818 --> 34:34.447
Your Honor, due to the promptness
of this trial, it was difficult

34:34.530 --> 34:37.867
for the defense to bring forth evidence
or produce witnesses.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.953
However, I would like to make a statement.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.997
-Please proceed.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.834
My client fled
the war-torn country of Syria

34:46.918 --> 34:50.213
with thousands of refugees
hoping to seek shelter in Israel.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.675
But they were met with hostility
and aggression by the Israeli government,

34:55.384 --> 34:57.678
who arrested my client without cause.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.765
My client is here as a refugee.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.851
If the Court decides
to send him back to Israel,

35:03.935 --> 35:07.605
he fears he would be persecuted
for his religious beliefs in Islam.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.359
Is that your whole statement, Miss Garcia?

35:11.442 --> 35:12.485
Yes, Your Honor.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.821
Does the respondent wish
to make a statement?

35:14.904 --> 35:17.115
-No, Your Honor.
-I'd like to say something.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.708
No one decides where they were born.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.754
Our birthplace was decided by fate.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.798
You were born here...

35:34.924 --> 35:36.217
I was born there.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.553
What divides us?

35:40.930 --> 35:41.931
A border...

35:43.224 --> 35:46.144
is an idea decided by the lucky.

35:48.396 --> 35:52.024
Today you sit
in the seat of the fortunate.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.070
Just remember what put you there.

35:58.698 --> 35:59.782
Fate.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.784
What is fate...

36:02.785 --> 36:04.203
but the hand of God?

36:25.433 --> 36:28.269
Ms. Lang, respondent is all yours.

36:32.648 --> 36:35.067
Mr. Masih, if I may?

36:36.944 --> 36:41.115
Can you tell the court
what you're doing in this video?

36:46.537 --> 36:50.374
It's hard to tell, but what I can tell you
is that you're not praying...

36:50.458 --> 36:51.584
at least, not like a Muslim.

36:52.293 --> 36:56.255
As I'm sure the court is aware,
Muslims observe five formal prayers a day.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.009
You didn't stand up
and face Mecca even once.

37:01.594 --> 37:06.557
So how can the respondent's council argue
that Mr. Masih can't be removed to Israel

37:06.641 --> 37:08.517
for fears of persecution for his religion

37:08.601 --> 37:11.479
-if he doesn't practice that religion?
-Objection, Your Honor.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.231
The prosecution is testifying,

37:13.314 --> 37:15.733
-not questioning my witness.
-Mr. Masih, what religion are you?

37:15.816 --> 37:17.860
You are not to question my client.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.403
I walk with all men.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.696

I'm following this man because I believe
he was sent here, to us, for a reason.

Look, I'm gonna stop you

completely out of context.

38:02.488 --> 38:03.823
Uh, yes, you are.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.994
The president is a man of faith.
He has a strong opinion about this.

come to me first.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.397
-It's complicated.
-Complicated.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.275
The president didn't fight for two years
to have his immigration policy

38:39.358 --> 38:42.153
called back into question
because of some fucking Arab.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.238
Respectfully, sir...

38:44.822 --> 38:47.491
the best way to make him disappear
is to detain him.

That way <i>we</i> own him.
We control the situation.

38:50.703 --> 38:53.247
Israel is demanding he be extradited.
There's no way around that.
