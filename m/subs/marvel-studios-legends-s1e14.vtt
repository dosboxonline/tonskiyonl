01:07.358 --> 01:08.777
You want me to slow him down, sir?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.446
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

01:12.322 --> 01:15.909
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

Loki has him under some kind of spell.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
What have you done to Barton?

01:40.183 --> 01:41.935
I'd say I have expanded his mind.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.900
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D.,
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.653
YELENA: What bullet does that?

01:51.736 --> 01:53.738
Not bullets. Arrows.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.115
He made a different call.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.746
Why am I back? How'd you get him out?

02:11.256 --> 02:13.007

-We rigged bombs.

-Who's "we"?
-Clint Barton.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.602
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.263
ULTRON: <i>It's time for some mind games.</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:03.183
I've done the whole
mind control thing. Not a fan.

<i>You got no backup here.</i>

03:11.441 --> 03:12.525

03:14.277 --> 03:15.862
This is an agent of some kind.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.871
<i>Fury helped me set this up when I joined.</i>

03:25.538 --> 03:28.291
Kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.837

<i>Those gods...</i>

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
You don't think they need me.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.558
I think they do,

03:46.643 --> 03:47.852
which is a lot scarier.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.855
They're a mess.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.763
But I'm going back out there
'cause this is my job.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.557
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.727
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.981
If you go out there,
you fight, and you fight to kill.
