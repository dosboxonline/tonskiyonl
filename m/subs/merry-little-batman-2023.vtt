Master Wayne, come along now.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.857
Time for your cookie-wookies
before bedtime.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.817
Not yet, Alfred.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.985
Selina stole priceless art

02:30.985 --> 02:32.820
- from the Gotham City Museum.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.822
I must have justice.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.827
- Ha!

02:43.414 --> 02:45.541
Phew! Close one, huh, Alfred?

02:45.541 --> 02:47.001
Close indeed.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.044
Now, let's end this madcappery

02:49.044 --> 02:50.588
before you actually
do break...

02:51.922 --> 02:54.675
...something like your great
grandfather's ashes.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.760
- And that priceless Picasso.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.769
There's no way to run, Selina.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.072
Ah-ha!

03:21.744 --> 03:23.996
Young man, may I remind you

03:23.996 --> 03:26.707
that Christmas is a mere
two days away?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.084
Father Christmas is watching.

03:29.084 --> 03:32.630
Good! 'Cause even Santa
wouldn't wanna miss this.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.382
- Ha!

03:38.719 --> 03:39.720
Whoa!

03:40.554 --> 03:41.472
Master Wayne.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.683
Will you be sleeping
down there again?

03:48.103 --> 03:48.938
Whoa!

03:55.611 --> 03:56.612
Whoa!

03:57.863 --> 03:59.114
No. No. No, no, no.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.283
Whoa!

04:01.283 --> 04:03.702
Whoa!

04:14.505 --> 04:16.006
What?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.766
Uh-oh.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.855
How's it going?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.525
Oh, my gosh!

04:34.525 --> 04:36.610
Are you okay?
Did you fall through that vent?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.237
Damian, you could've
gotten hurt.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.571
You shouldn't play
with the cat.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.490
You could've gotten
scratched, or worse!

04:41.490 --> 04:42.658
You could've gotten
a brain parasite

04:42.658 --> 04:44.076
from its fecal matter.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.663
A boo-boo!

04:48.247 --> 04:49.373
Aw, Dad!

04:49.373 --> 04:50.749
Quit worrying so much.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.126
I'm totally fine.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.086
The HVAC unit broke
my fall, see?

04:58.841 --> 04:59.758
Yeah.

05:00.426 --> 05:03.762
Damian, what have we said
about being more careful

05:03.762 --> 05:06.390
and less destructive when
you're playing superhero?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.475
I'm not playing, Dad.
I'm training.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.602
To be a real hero. Like you.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.939
Picture it. You and me
fighting back to back.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.941
Fearless defenders
of the night.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.485
Protecting the weak.
Punishing the wicked.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.487
Crime doesn't stand a chance.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.406
Uh-huh. And I've told you,

05:22.406 --> 05:24.450
you're not ready
for that kind of stuff.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.492
Because being
a superhero takes...

05:25.492 --> 05:28.871
 Focus,
responsibility and sacrifice.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.164
I know. I know.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.583
Not to mention a pretty
high pain threshold.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.293
You know how many ribs
I've broken?

05:34.293 --> 05:35.377
All of them.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.548
Cool! I want to break
all of my ribs, too.

05:39.548 --> 05:40.841
Come on, kiddo.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.593
Now look, even if I thought
you were ready

05:42.593 --> 05:44.803
to be a crime fighter,
which I don't,

05:44.803 --> 05:47.389
there isn't any crime
left in Gotham to fight.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.807
What do you mean?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.351
Damian? The day I found out
I was going to be a dad

05:51.351 --> 05:53.312
was the happiest day
I've had since...

05:54.271 --> 05:55.939
Well, a long time.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.108
It's like in one instant,
the only thing that mattered

05:58.108 --> 06:00.027
was protecting you
from ever getting hurt.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.237
So before you were born,

06:02.237 --> 06:04.490
I worked overtime
to make Gotham safe.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.763
What was that?

06:34.520 --> 06:35.521
<i>- In breaking news,</i>

06:35.521 --> 06:37.147
<i>all of Gotham City's
supervillains</i>

06:37.147 --> 06:39.149
<i>are now either behind bars</i>

06:39.149 --> 06:41.026
<i>or have been forced
into retirement.</i>

06:41.026 --> 06:44.279
<i>Gotham is officially
90 days crime free</i>

06:44.279 --> 06:46.865
<i>as Batman continues
to clean it up.</i>

06:46.865 --> 06:48.617
<i>Gotham City just voted</i>

06:48.617 --> 06:50.828
<i>the safest place
on planet Earth.</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:56.125
There is no more crime
in Gotham.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.710
So enjoy being a kid.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.504
But I don't wanna be
just a kid.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.132
Whoa! You are way more
than just a kid.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.633
You're "my" kid.

07:05.134 --> 07:07.052
- And that's the best kind.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.766
Wait, Dad, what were you doing
down in the basement anyway?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.893
Me? Oh, uh, I don't know.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.228
Maybe I was, uh...

07:16.228 --> 07:18.856
...wrapping
someone's Christmas present.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.440
- Yes! What is it?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.734
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.528
Sorry, sport. Bedtime.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.071
Can I at least get a hint?

07:26.071 --> 07:29.783
Let's just say it's something
no future superhero

07:29.783 --> 07:31.285
should be without.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.287
- Is it a Bat-grappling gun?
- Nope.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.582
- Razor-lined Bat-gauntlets.
- Good gravy. No!

07:36.582 --> 07:38.625
- Bat-ice skates?
- Skates?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.294
Now, that's just silly.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.297
Is it
a Bat-laser torch?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.298
No.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.304
Bat-cryptographer sequencer?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.222
I'm not even sure what that is.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.558
A heat-seeking
Bat-rocket launcher?

07:54.558 --> 07:57.561
Nope. And you guessed
that already. Twice.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.856
Master Wayne,

08:00.856 --> 08:03.025
stop playing with your
blood sausage.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.235
Right, yeah,
totally. Sorry, Alfred.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.988
Now, let's enjoy
the traditional

08:07.988 --> 08:10.365
Christmas Eve
breakfast of my youth.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.575
Best hurry.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.494
If jellied eel sits too
long, it tends to...

08:15.412 --> 08:16.622
congeal.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.084
Mm. Mm.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.137
Mm.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.806
Donut tell anybody.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.850
Kapow!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.227
<i>♪ Da-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

08:38.227 --> 08:41.063
And no cowls
at the table.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.607
Aw, come one.
It's Christmas Eve!

08:43.607 --> 08:45.442
Damian, you heard Alfred.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.243
Hmph.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.246
Ah, what the heck?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.249
Here you go, Damian.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.585
Whoa! You mean
I can open it now?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.963
Why not? You get
to stop guessing

09:05.963 --> 09:07.714
and I get to hear myself
think again.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.925
- It's a win-win.
- Mm-hm.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.677
Merry Christmas, kiddo.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.768
My own utility belt!

09:19.768 --> 09:22.813
Yeah, that was
my first utility belt, Damian.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.482
What? No way! Oh, man!
I can't believe it.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.818
This is the best, Dad!
You're the best!

09:27.818 --> 09:29.653
Alfred, isn't Dad the best?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.948
- Oh, my. Yes.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.741
This is indeed exciting.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.576
Oh, what did you put
in the pouches?

09:40.122 --> 09:41.832
That's your Bat-first-aid kit.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.667
Oh, neat.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.252
How about this?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.004
Your Bat-mergency whistle.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.588
Nice.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.550
Which should only be used
in case of a Bat-mergency.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.346
Whoa! A Batarang

10:00.934 --> 10:02.477
- It's foam.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.105
But isn't it supposed to fly
back to me.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.440
So it can poke you in the eye?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.607
I don't think so.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.276
That's a practice Batarang.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.323
Dad, don't get me wrong.
I love this belt.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.616
I mean, I love, love, love it.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.285
But where's the, you know,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.203
cool stuff?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.288
You mean dangerous stuff?

10:21.913 --> 10:23.832
Damian, you'll have
to earn those things
when you're older.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.417
You still have a lot to learn.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.586
Oh, come on, Dad.
I'm not a baby.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.338
Hey, I never said
you were a baby.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.131
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:32.799
<i>My precious little baby
is in danger.</i>

10:33.884 --> 10:35.719
I'll re-record that for you.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.307
Damian, this is the first step
toward becoming a superhero.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.434
Believe me,
I agonized for months

10:42.434 --> 10:43.810
over whether you're
ready for even--

10:43.810 --> 10:45.937
- What's that?

10:45.937 --> 10:48.690
- It sounds like the--
- It can't be.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.776
Can't be what?
What can't it be?

10:50.776 --> 10:52.235
The Batphone.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.072
Ooh, wait for me.
I'll put on my belt!

10:55.072 --> 10:56.740
I mean...

10:56.740 --> 10:57.908
Wait for me.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.326
I'll put on my belt.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.419
No one's called
this thing in years.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.713
Crime must be back
in Gotham.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.799
It's a Christmas miracle!

11:14.466 --> 11:16.009
- Hello?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.469
It's the Justice League.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.638
What? Are you serious?

11:19.638 --> 11:20.972
Quick. How's my belt look?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.392
Uh-huh. No, I... I hear you.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.644
A weather anomaly?
In Nova Scotia?

11:25.644 --> 11:27.104
Just let Clark handle it.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.982
It's Christmas Eve.
We all have plans.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.735
No need to send Superman.
We got this.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.153
Sorry, that was Damian.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.114
Yeah, he's eight now.
Crazy, right?

11:37.823 --> 11:39.199
You can't call anyone else?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.367
How about the Twins?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.285
- They're not talking?

11:42.285 --> 11:44.371
Well tell them to activate
their Wonder Twin powers

11:44.371 --> 11:46.331
and form into mature adults.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.084
All right. Fine.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.544
I'll leave in five.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.381
Sorry, Damian. I gotta go.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.551
But I promise I'll be back
before Christmas.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.010
Wait, Dad! Dad! Dad!

11:59.010 --> 12:00.303
Let me come with you. Please!

12:01.012 --> 12:02.180
I don't think so, kiddo.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.683
It could be your Christmas
gift for the next year.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.143
For the next ten years!

12:07.227 --> 12:09.354
I can't risk it.
The answer's no.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.732
Mm.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.277
Good. Now, where's your
emergency contact list?

12:15.277 --> 12:16.319
Actually, never mind.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.904
I printed extra copies
for your belt.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.868
Okay. What do you do

12:22.868 --> 12:24.244
in the event
of a home invasion?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.328
Call the police.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.913
- Mental breakdown?
- Therapist.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.665
A race of giant,
super-intelligent

12:28.665 --> 12:30.208
fungus-beetles attack Gotham?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.210
I don't know.
Call Commissioner Gordon?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.171
Commiss-- What? No!

12:34.171 --> 12:36.047
All he ever does
is pass the buck to me.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.508
I'll be back before
you know it, buddy.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.846
I shall ready the Batjet,
Master Wayne.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.224
Batjet, huh?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.492
You're making record time

13:03.492 --> 13:05.452
for not having done this
in years, Bruce.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.287
Did you program
the coordinates?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.206
And pre-heated
the seat warmer, sir.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.210
Shall I assume

13:13.210 --> 13:16.880
we did not see the Bat-razor
I left on the vanity?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.340
Really? The beard again?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.177
I like it. It totally ups
my intimidation game.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.807
You have donut crumbs
in your intimidation game, sir.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.936
- Hm.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.562
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

13:32.562 --> 13:34.272
<i>My precious little baby
is in danger.</i>

13:34.272 --> 13:35.482
What the...

13:37.567 --> 13:39.402
<i>- Emergency! Call for help.</i>

13:39.402 --> 13:41.238
<i>- My precious little baby...</i>
- Come on.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.114
- Damian!

13:43.114 --> 13:44.574
Wow! Dad!

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
You look awesome!

13:47.619 --> 13:49.454
Damian, get out of the bag.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.623
Come on, Dad, just let
me come with you.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.875
No. We don't have
time for this.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.460
You won't even know I'm here.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.711
I told you,

13:56.711 --> 13:59.381
- you're not ready.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.050
Ugh! Dad, look how hard
I've been training.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.385
I mean, check out
my rad ninja skills.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.637
-  Get over here. Argh!

14:06.596 --> 14:08.598
Argh! My good hip.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.684
Oh, my gosh! Alfred!
I'm so sorry.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.145
Damian Thomas Wayne!
That is enough!

14:17.857 --> 14:18.692
I just thought

14:19.568 --> 14:20.819
getting your belt meant

14:21.403 --> 14:23.572
that I was ready to be
a superhero like you.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.407
Well, it didn't.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.576
In fact, give me the belt.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.786
You're clearly
not ready for it.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.830
What? Dad, no!

14:32.914 --> 14:33.832
Damian.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.473
Hold on to this
until I get back.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.560
Okay. Now give me a...

14:55.103 --> 14:56.229
goodbye hug?

15:03.820 --> 15:06.239
He'll be fine, sir.
I'll see to that.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.409
I knew he wasn't ready
to have his own belt.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.871
Yes. Well,
I can certainly agree

15:12.871 --> 15:14.873
that "someone" wasn't ready.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.420
I gotta get going, Alfred.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.891
Godspeed, sir.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.745
Come along, Damian.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.290
I've got just the thing
to lift your spirits.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.710
A steaming mug of my
world-famous hot cocoa.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.796
With extra marshmallows.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.049
Thanks, but coco's
kinda kid stuff.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.425
"Kid stuff?"

16:07.425 --> 16:09.719
Oh, your father
would disagree.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.847
I once saw him drink
an entire gallon
in one sitting.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.182
You did not.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.017
Did so.
And he had quite

16:16.017 --> 16:17.769
the swollen stomach
that evening.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.064
Why I had to take
the Batsuit out
an entire two inches

16:21.064 --> 16:22.774
before he could even
go out on patrol.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.089
This is so unfair, Selina.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
You're right. I can't give up.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.305
I'll work even harder
to prove I'm ready
to be Batman.

16:55.223 --> 16:56.808
And you know what that means?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.769
Time for some extreme training.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.025
Unsupervised
extreme training.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.615
I don't know, Alfred.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.285
Do you really think
a steaming mug

17:15.285 --> 17:17.287
of your world-famous
hot cocoa

17:17.287 --> 17:19.706
with extra marshmallows
could help?

17:19.706 --> 17:22.041
Why I'm certain of it, sir.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.711
Unless it's too much trouble.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.504
Nonsense. Coming up.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.179
All right, Pennyworth,
time to deliver your A-game.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.318
Aw, man!

18:00.079 --> 18:01.164
Hm.

18:02.665 --> 18:03.583
Hmph.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.229
And now
the piece de resistance.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.150
Good heavens!
Out of marshmallows?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.485
- What?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.237
How did that happen?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.490
This is catastrophic.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.908
That's okay.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.159
After all, it's...

18:38.159 --> 18:40.453
it's only cocoa
without marshmallows.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.581
It's not like
it's Christmas Eve

18:43.581 --> 18:44.707
without my...

18:44.707 --> 18:46.125
...dad.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.095
Fear not.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.597
I shall return
before your cocoa

18:59.597 --> 19:01.349
even has a chance to cool.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.938
You sure?
You really don't need to,

19:06.938 --> 19:08.857
but if you insist.
Hurry back. Okay, bye.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.694
And now, time to train

19:12.694 --> 19:14.445
for I am...

19:14.445 --> 19:16.364
the Night!

19:16.364 --> 19:19.033
Night. Night.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.536
Night. Night...

19:32.922 --> 19:34.007
Oh, biscuits!

19:37.844 --> 19:39.012
I beg your pardon.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.974
Hey, watch where
you're going, grandpa!

19:43.558 --> 19:46.227
There's some real psychos
in this neighborhood.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.832
<i>♪ If God came down

20:07.832 --> 20:10.960

20:51.793 --> 20:54.212
I don't need some trip
to Nova Scotia.

20:54.212 --> 20:57.465
This is the best
Christmas Eve ever!

20:57.465 --> 20:59.384
Ever! Ever!

20:59.384 --> 21:02.387
I haven't determined the cause
of the Batjet malfunction,

21:02.387 --> 21:04.305
but there's no anomaly up here.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.307
In fact,
it's a perfectly typical

21:06.307 --> 21:08.351
- Nova Scotia blizzard!

21:11.854 --> 21:13.773
What do you mean,
"What anomaly," J'onn?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.984
If you didn't send me here,
who did?

21:15.984 --> 21:18.444
Ugh!

21:18.444 --> 21:20.530
- Oh, no. Hello?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.865
J'onzz? Hello!

21:24.659 --> 21:25.493
Great.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.454
I can't miss Christmas.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.833
Damian, I'm coming!

21:41.551 --> 21:44.053
Please, why are you doing this?

21:44.053 --> 21:46.556
Yeah. It's Christmas,
you monster.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.267
I'm just making
some Christmas memories.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.060
Say, "Cheese."

21:51.060 --> 21:53.563
Ugh! Stop it with the videos.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.566
What? Is it a crime
to document our crimes.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.234
Just throw
the goods in the van,

21:58.234 --> 21:59.527
- you idiot!

21:59.527 --> 22:01.279
We've got a lot
of mansions to hit.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.120
And now, the most important
part of training,

22:09.120 --> 22:12.040
the post-workout carbo load.

22:16.461 --> 22:17.712
It's good.

22:17.712 --> 22:21.632
But it could have a bit more
turbo charge.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.353
I survived an explosion.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.147
Again.

22:50.495 --> 22:53.539
This neighborhood's
prime for the picking.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.916
Which house
do you want to hit next?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.380
That one will do.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.757
So big.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.977
Oh, man.
Alfred's back already?

23:18.981 --> 23:21.275
Ah, we've hit a gold mine.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.569
Looks like no one's home.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.614
Will you shut up and help me,
you ding-dong?

23:28.407 --> 23:29.242
Burglars!

23:30.535 --> 23:32.912
Oh, no. What do I do?
What do I do?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.795
Okay, Damian, calm down.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.588
Think. It's just
a home invasion.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.965
A home invasion?

23:43.965 --> 23:46.592
Dad never told me what to do
in case of one of these.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.638
Ugh! What is this?
Bulletproof glass?

23:50.638 --> 23:51.848
- Here, I've got it.
- No, no, no!

23:57.687 --> 23:58.521
Ugh!

23:59.188 --> 24:01.065
<i>Emergency...</i>
- Not now. Come on, turn off.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.233
- Turn off.
<i>- ...my baby is in--</i>

24:10.616 --> 24:11.617
Told you I had it.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.251
Terry, I think
we hit the jackpot.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.419
Cha-ching.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.964
What have I told you
about that stupid phone?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.133
What? Uh-oh.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.385
-  Ouch! I bit my tongue.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.931
Ah, there's so much stuff.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.559
How are we gonna fit all
this junk inside the van?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.769
We'll just grab what we can
and get a move on.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.813
The boss doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.106
Yeah, that's true.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.900
Remember what happened
to the last bloke?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.276
Ugh! Don't remind me.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.903
I can still hear his screams.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.866
Hang on, Selina.
I'm calling for help.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.493
Police.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.872
<i>Gotham City Police.
How can I help you?</i>

24:57.872 --> 25:00.458
Check out this cool belt.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.378
You think I could
rock something like this?

25:04.378 --> 25:06.797
Just throw it in the bag,
you idiot.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.840
Yeah, okay.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.383
I'm gonna try you on...

25:09.383 --> 25:13.262
...later.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.514
No!

25:22.104 --> 25:23.481
They can't take my belt.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.316
Dad already thinks
I'm not ready for it.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.902
It'll be years before
he trusts me with another one.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.447
Unless I get it back myself,

25:31.447 --> 25:34.200
then Dad would see that
I am ready to be a superhero.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.577
<i>Hello?
What's the emergency?</i>

25:36.577 --> 25:37.912
<i>Is anyone injured?</i>

25:37.912 --> 25:40.790
No. But they will be.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.124
-  <i>Hello?</i>

25:44.794 --> 25:46.337
- Come on, Selina.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.923
-  You hear something?

26:00.101 --> 26:04.146
Man, they wasted
a lot of moolah
on a bunch of dumb books.

26:04.146 --> 26:07.733
There's a whole shelf
on excavating shale rock
from underneath manors.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.027
That's weirdly specific.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.155
Hasn't anyone ever told you

26:13.155 --> 26:14.949
to be quiet in a library?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.628
Give me back my belt.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.465
Okay, you have got
to be kidding me.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.676
Now, this
I've got to get.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.720
Nice entrance, kid.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.179
What are you supposed to be?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.639
I'm Batman.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.976
And your night just got
a whole lot darker.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.229
All right. Come here, kid.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.189
Where did he go?

26:47.189 --> 26:48.232
Peek-a-boo!

26:50.318 --> 26:52.945
- Ugh, just my luck.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.780
Okay, you little brat.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.115
You had your fun.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.326
Uh, I can't see anything.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.161
You can even
say you're blind

27:00.161 --> 27:01.287
as a bat.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.289
- What was that?
- What's going on?

27:05.541 --> 27:06.375
<i>Adios.</i>

27:07.293 --> 27:09.253
Get over here,
you little turdmuffin!

27:12.423 --> 27:15.384
I'm gonna
tear that bat's wings off.

27:15.384 --> 27:16.886
Is that all you got?

27:19.263 --> 27:20.264
Uh-oh.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.482
Argh!

27:31.484 --> 27:33.027
I'm gonna puke.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.498
I'm over here, bozos!

27:45.498 --> 27:47.833
Come and get me.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.252
I'm gonna deck the halls
with this kid.

27:59.845 --> 28:00.763
Ha!

28:13.359 --> 28:14.485
What the...

28:14.485 --> 28:15.778
A kiddy pool?

28:15.778 --> 28:18.322
That's to put out
the grease fire.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.491
Water doesn't put out
grease fires.

28:20.491 --> 28:21.951
Exactly.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.731
Is that our...

29:01.115 --> 29:03.200
Ugh! Congealed eel?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.994
That's it! I've had it!

29:04.994 --> 29:06.787
Grab what you can.
We're out of here.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.207
Load up. I'll start the van.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.211
- Let it go, kid.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.881
Give me back my utility belt.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.216
You mean my utility belt?

29:20.718 --> 29:22.970
<i>Emergency! Call for help.</i>

29:22.970 --> 29:24.889
<i>- My precious little baby is...</i>
- There it is.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.476
Ugh!

29:29.602 --> 29:30.686
Will you hurry up?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.900
- Stop! Get back here.

29:39.403 --> 29:40.237
Later, kid.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.743
Now, you're gonna feel
my ninja skills.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.203
This kid
just won't quit.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.454
Oh, that's no kid.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.416
That's some kind
of feral mutant.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.376
Whoa!

29:55.252 --> 29:57.379
Oh, no!
The boss is gonna kill us.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.798
Now you've got nothing.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.176
Oh, I wouldn't say nothing.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.386
Whoa!

30:05.262 --> 30:06.597
I got your belt.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.599
You lose, kid.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.108
Hm?

30:18.859 --> 30:20.027
Whoa!

30:24.365 --> 30:28.369
My belt may be gone,
but this is far from over.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.454
I will have vengeance.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.414
Because they didn't
cross some kid.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.917
They crossed Batman's kid!

30:46.637 --> 30:49.306
Sorry, Selina,
but you can't come.

30:49.306 --> 30:51.350
This is gonna be
way too dangerous.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.228
Once I pass through
these doors,

30:54.228 --> 30:56.522
the Damian you knew
will be no more.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.148
I know, you're scared for me.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.526
And honestly,
I'm a little scared, too.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.403
- But...

31:03.862 --> 31:04.697
Oh.

31:06.657 --> 31:08.325
Take care
of the house while I'm gone.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.787
outrun this sick set
of wheels.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.623
Oh,
what do we have here?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.383
Huh...

32:48.425 --> 32:49.468
It's a bit saggy.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.890
Well, that one just leaves
nothing to the imagination.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.737
What's this?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.412
No way.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.340
Dad made me a Batsuit.

33:33.762 --> 33:34.888
Awesome.

33:38.726 --> 33:41.603
Whoa! Wait until
they get a load of me.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.523
<i>Damian. It's Dad.</i>

33:44.523 --> 33:45.733
Dad?

33:45.733 --> 33:48.902
<i>If you're wearing that suit,
it means I am dead,</i>

33:48.902 --> 33:50.779
<i>and my worst fear
has come true.</i>

33:50.779 --> 33:52.281
<i>Crime is back in Gotham.</i>

33:53.115 --> 33:55.367
<i>And now you must take my place
and become...</i>

33:56.326 --> 33:57.244
<i>the Batman.</i>

33:58.120 --> 34:00.456

the Batcave

34:04.126 --> 34:05.127
Yikes.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.715
<i>By now, I'd already
given you the utility belt
that goes with your suit.</i>

34:09.715 --> 34:13.051
<i>That Batsuit is the most
technologically advanced yet.</i>

34:13.051 --> 34:14.303
Heck, yeah.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.013
<i>But before we get
into that tech,</i>

34:16.013 --> 34:18.098
<i>there's a few things

34:18.098 --> 34:19.767
<i>in case we never
got the chance.</i>

34:19.767 --> 34:21.185
<i>Like when I met your mom.</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:23.520
<i>Damian, your mother
was a total smokeshow.</i>

34:23.520 --> 34:26.398
How do you
fast forward this thing?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.525
<i>- ...Sugar Moose.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.693
<i>...you might be

34:29.693 --> 34:32.070
<i>where your body

some changes...</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:33.489
Ugh! Gross.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.243
<i>You gotta be careful, Damian.</i>

34:39.244 --> 34:42.915
<i>Oh, Alfred,
the diaper's integrity,

<i>...and though I'd won
the brutal fight,</i>

34:49.963 --> 34:53.300

34:53.300 --> 34:54.301
<i>Every day.</i>

34:55.594 --> 34:57.387
<i>Okay, so, onto the Batsuit.</i>

34:57.387 --> 34:58.555
Yeah!

34:58.555 --> 35:02.726
<i>To be honest, Damian,
part of me never wanted you
to have to put that suit on.</i>

35:02.726 --> 35:05.103
<i>But another part of me
always knew deep down</i>

35:05.103 --> 35:07.606
<i>that this is what
you were born to do.</i>

35:07.606 --> 35:11.276
<i>My only regret
is not being by your side
when you did it.</i>

35:11.276 --> 35:14.154
<i>Thankfully, that's where
the suit's tech comes in.</i>

35:14.154 --> 35:18.534
<i>With the help of AI,
I've programmed myself
into the suit.</i>

35:56.405 --> 35:59.741
Wow, you can talk? Cool.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.744
Uh... computer, status report.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.580
Please, call me Bat-Dad.

36:04.580 --> 36:08.500
Bio scans indicate
you are eight years
and four days old.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.003
Recommendation,

36:11.003 --> 36:14.256
Great. It's just as overbearing
as the real thing.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.592
Would you like me
to read you a story?

36:16.592 --> 36:18.010
No, thank you.

We don't have time for this,
Bat-Dad.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.351
I have it downloaded

36:26.351 --> 36:28.604
Mute, mute, mute!

36:28.604 --> 36:31.273
It sounds like
you'd like to mute
your dead father.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.191
Would you like to mute
your dead father?

36:33.191 --> 36:36.945
No. I mean, yes,
but my dad isn't...

36:38.113 --> 36:39.615

36:39.615 --> 36:41.700
No mute function found.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.035
Then why did you just offer?

36:52.252 --> 36:53.837
Whoa!

36:55.464 --> 36:57.466
Awesome.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.301
I'm not

37:01.845 --> 37:04.806
Can we just focus?
I need to get my belt back.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.767
Affirmative.
The ability to focus

37:06.767 --> 37:09.353
is a quality
every good superhero
must possess.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.646
Uh-huh, yep, thanks.

37:10.646 --> 37:13.523
But I already know
the qualities
of a good superhero.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.068
Excellent.
Would you care to review?

37:16.068 --> 37:18.612
Focus, responsibility,
sacrifice--

37:18.612 --> 37:20.322
Please, just stop talking.

Probably us.
We had one job and we blew it.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.909
Now we've got to meet
the boss empty handed.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.787
We are in so much trouble.

39:31.787 --> 39:34.873

completely empty handed.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.249
Let me do the talking.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.672
On second thoughts,
you do the talking.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.429
Hello, sir. You in here?

39:49.429 --> 39:54.101
My associate and I were
just saying what
a lovely hideout you...

39:56.978 --> 39:59.189
have... here.

40:04.820 --> 40:10.450
Well, if it isn't my two
favorite new henchmen,
Roscoe and Whatchamacallit.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.371
Um... she's Francine, and I'm--

40:14.371 --> 40:17.249
Good evening, Mr. Joker, sir.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.127
You two are looking
a little worse for wear.

40:20.127 --> 40:24.422
Hopefully that's a sign
you did your part
in my a master plan for Gotham.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.301
Oh, how I want to make this
a very special Christmas Eve.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.595
Oh, yeah, we had a blast.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.597
You should have seen
this one bloke, he was like--

40:32.597 --> 40:35.600
I'm sorry if I gave
the impression I cared.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.562
Now then,
what do you got for me?

40:38.562 --> 40:42.190
Oh, what do we got?
Oh, sure, uh...

40:42.190 --> 40:43.900
Why don't you go ahead
and do that, Terry,

40:43.900 --> 40:45.235
since you're kind of
spearheading that?

40:45.235 --> 40:48.113
No, no, you do the honors, Francine.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.573
You do it.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.158
It wasn't me who lost the loot.

40:51.158 --> 40:53.952
I wouldn't have
dropped the loot
if you'd driven straight

40:54.077 --> 40:56.163
instead of being scared by
a two-year-old.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.205
He was at least
four and a half.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.875
Just give it to me.
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

40:59.875 --> 41:02.210
Gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.713
Uh... here you go, boss.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.426
What's happening here?

41:10.260 --> 41:11.094
Where's the rest?

41:11.094 --> 41:15.015
That, actually, is the rest,
Mr. Joker. Sir.

41:15.015 --> 41:18.143
You've been out all day
and you just bring me this?

41:20.520 --> 41:23.315
Of all the elves I had
do my Christmas bidding,

41:23.315 --> 41:26.610
I gave you two
the poshest neighborhood.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.029
We had more. Lots more.

41:29.029 --> 41:33.950
But then we ran into
a number of unforeseen,
unfortunate--

41:33.950 --> 41:34.868
It was Batman.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.955
Batman? Impossible.
I tricked him into
leaving Gotham.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.542
Oh, even after
all these years apart,
he still ruins everything.

41:42.542 --> 41:46.463
How can he be everywhere
at the same time?
All at once, all the time?

41:46.463 --> 41:48.423
I'm so sick
of these Batman games.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.636
No, it was a little Batman.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.347
Little Batman?

41:55.347 --> 41:57.432
What, did he shrink
or something? Hm?

41:57.432 --> 42:00.227
What Terry is trying
to say is--

42:00.227 --> 42:02.520
So, there was this little kid
dressed up as Batman.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.523
He beat the crud out of us
in a surprisingly
skillful manner.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.693
And it was all
because of that belt.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.780
He went berserk for it.

42:18.620 --> 42:19.871
So, let me get this straight.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.874
You're telling me
you two were beat by
a child in a...

42:22.874 --> 42:24.876
 Batman costume?

42:24.876 --> 42:28.463
More like PJs
and a paper-bag mask.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.131
There you go. See for yourself.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.635
<i>I'm afraid of the dark.</i>

42:33.635 --> 42:35.720
<i>- What was that?
- What's going on?</i>

42:38.974 --> 42:41.977
Ooh, my. Look at that
little hellion go.

42:41.977 --> 42:44.271
And such rad ninja skills.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.900
Whoa! Was that a grease fire?
So clever.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.570
How do you rewind this thing?
Okay, okay, here it is.

42:53.947 --> 42:57.242
Oh, he really fried you
like a couple of
chicken fingers.

42:57.242 --> 43:00.036
Okay, okay.
One more time.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.003
This child is sensational.

43:08.003 --> 43:10.630
<i>Give me my belt.</i>

43:10.630 --> 43:13.216
I was only planning
to steal Christmas.

43:13.216 --> 43:16.469
But after watching
this kid's work,
it's all so clear.

43:16.469 --> 43:19.014
Why would we just
steal Gotham's Christmas

43:19.014 --> 43:23.852
when it would be
so much more festive
to destroy it?

43:23.852 --> 43:25.020
And who better to do it

43:25.020 --> 43:29.941
than a merry little Batman?

43:39.868 --> 43:41.411
What do you have in mind, boss?

43:42.162 --> 43:43.121
Are you still here?

43:49.085 --> 43:50.628
Can I at least
have my phone?

43:56.426 --> 43:59.512
<i>Give me my belt.</i>

43:59.512 --> 44:03.224
My, how the little cherub
wants his toy belt back.

44:06.603 --> 44:08.355
Did I miss
all the fun?

44:08.355 --> 44:11.566
No. In fact, thanks
to this stocking stuffer,

44:11.566 --> 44:13.109
the real fun is about to begin.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.446
Sounds divine.

44:19.157 --> 44:23.870
Now, if I were a kid
looking for my toy,
where would I look?

44:23.870 --> 44:25.121
Hm.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.664
Of course.

44:28.166 --> 44:31.795
Or should I say, "Ho, ho, ho."

44:42.555 --> 44:45.558
Looking for those scum this way
is taking too long.

44:45.558 --> 44:48.353
Bat-Dad, don't you have
some kind of secret
surveillance system?

44:48.353 --> 44:50.647
You know, one that can
tap into everyone's cell phones

44:50.647 --> 44:52.023
and give us eyes everywhere?

44:52.023 --> 44:53.817
Aha. I'm sorry.

44:53.817 --> 44:56.903
That would be
an egregious violation
of basic privacy.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.073
No one should be allowed
to have eyes and ears everywhere.

45:00.073 --> 45:03.701
Lucky for us,
someone already does.

45:08.581 --> 45:10.375
Santa Claus.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.919
You should get a picture.
Alfred would love that.

45:12.919 --> 45:16.005
No pictures, only justice.

45:18.675 --> 45:22.345
Oh, man,
I'm the worst dad ever.

45:22.345 --> 45:25.390
And I'm not racking up
any superhero points, either.

45:25.390 --> 45:29.561
Anomaly.
Come on, Bruce.
Walked right into that one.

45:29.561 --> 45:32.188
I mean, this is textbook
supervillain stuff.

45:32.188 --> 45:35.108
Step one, get Batman
out of town.

45:35.108 --> 45:39.237
Step two, unleash an evil plot
and threaten Gotham
and all its people.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.531
All its people...

45:41.531 --> 45:46.703
Damian! Great, like that kid
doesn't find a way
to find trouble on his own.

45:47.287 --> 45:50.457
I mean, by now he probably...

45:52.041 --> 45:53.877
Dad, help me.

45:53.877 --> 45:55.962
Dad, I need you.

45:55.962 --> 45:59.007
Damian! I'll see you
in the Promised Land.

46:00.216 --> 46:01.551
Alfred, no...

46:02.719 --> 46:03.720
Ahh, no!

46:05.013 --> 46:06.389
Don't go there.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.892
Remember what
your therapist said
about your brooding?

46:08.892 --> 46:11.644
Just focus
on the repair, Brucey.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.147
Let's see what we got.

46:16.191 --> 46:18.318
Yep, that's what I thought.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.153
Freeze.

46:34.209 --> 46:35.710
Whoa!

46:42.675 --> 46:44.636
Look at all these toys.

46:52.602 --> 46:55.396
Happy holidays.

47:00.401 --> 47:03.488
- Donut eat it all at once.

47:04.948 --> 47:05.990
Donuts.

47:09.577 --> 47:13.623
Focus on the belt.
I am the night.
I am the night.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.087
Excuse me, citizen of Gotham.

47:19.087 --> 47:22.549
Uh-oh. Looks like
someone got their holidays
mixed up.

47:22.549 --> 47:24.092
It's not Halloween, silly.

47:24.092 --> 47:26.094
Santa Claus. Where is he?

47:26.094 --> 47:29.556
Why, jolly old St. Nick's
up in his North Pole workshop,
of course.

47:29.556 --> 47:30.974
Located in our toy department.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.770
The escalators
are right over there.

47:45.446 --> 47:47.115
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

47:52.495 --> 47:55.123
It's your turn, little bat boy.

47:55.999 --> 47:58.084
Whoo-hoo, Santa!

47:59.919 --> 48:02.505
I don't have time
to get into anything
on my Christmas list.

48:02.505 --> 48:06.259
Like a new pair of
titanium Bat-cuffs
or some Bat-Cloaking gear,

48:06.259 --> 48:08.678
or this really cool pneumatic
Bat-Grenade launcher

48:08.678 --> 48:09.762
that comes with the laser scope

48:09.762 --> 48:11.472
and the glow-in-the-dark
Bat-symbols.

48:18.688 --> 48:20.523
I need information, Santa.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.736
Wait a minute.

48:25.528 --> 48:26.988
You're not Santa.

48:26.988 --> 48:27.989
Sure, he is.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.659
Hello.

48:31.659 --> 48:37.081
How else could he possibly
know what you really
want for Christmas?

48:38.958 --> 48:40.752
Wait. How did you...

48:42.253 --> 48:43.630
Poison Ivy!

48:44.547 --> 48:48.217
And you must be... Bane.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.887
Come get your little belt,
Bat-Mite.

48:51.721 --> 48:53.348
Give me that back.

49:07.236 --> 49:08.071
Terrific.

49:09.447 --> 49:12.241
Observation.
The collateral damage
you are causing

49:12.241 --> 49:13.242
is putting you and others--

49:13.242 --> 49:15.078
I can't stop now.
If I get my belt back,

49:15.078 --> 49:17.538
I'll prove that
I'm ready to be a superhero.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.131
Huh.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.720
Works every time.

49:33.262 --> 49:34.097
Whoa!

49:35.890 --> 49:38.559
I picked something up for you
in the garden section.

49:43.356 --> 49:44.190
My foliage.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.568
Finally.

49:55.368 --> 49:57.995
Not yet.
Remember what Joker said.

49:57.995 --> 50:01.791
We have to let
the little disaster artist
work his magic first.

50:09.382 --> 50:10.508
No!

50:14.262 --> 50:16.013
Why... does... Santa...

50:16.013 --> 50:17.890
need so many... reindeer?

50:25.481 --> 50:26.566
Whoa, whoa!

50:38.703 --> 50:39.704
-  What's going on?

50:39.704 --> 50:41.956
-  You okay, kid?
-  It's a freaking bat.

50:41.956 --> 50:44.959
It's okay, citizens.
I... I'm a super...

50:53.676 --> 50:54.844
Oh, no.

51:07.231 --> 51:08.274
Hey, watch it.

51:32.381 --> 51:35.802
Bat-Dad, bring up directions
to the Gotham Zoo.

51:35.802 --> 51:36.969
<i>Moments ago,</i>

51:36.969 --> 51:39.639
<i>a tiny, masked figure
single handedly perpetrated</i>

51:39.639 --> 51:44.143
<i>the most odious act
of yuletide vandalism
this city has ever seen.</i>

51:44.143 --> 51:47.563
<i>I spoke to a concerned citizen
who had this to say.</i>

51:48.356 --> 51:50.316
<i>I'm concerned.</i>

51:50.316 --> 51:52.652
<i>Who was this
snack-sized scrooge?</i>

51:52.652 --> 51:55.363
<i>And why did he have to
ruin it for everybody?</i>

51:55.363 --> 51:57.490
<i>Those questions
remain unanswered.</i>

51:57.490 --> 52:00.910
<i>But this home grown Gothamite
will only say this:</i>

52:00.910 --> 52:03.663
<i>Humbug to you,
you little menace.</i>

52:03.663 --> 52:07.667
<i>Wherever you are,
it'll take more than
knocking down our tree</i>

52:07.667 --> 52:10.002
<i>to ruin this city's
Christmas spirit.</i>

52:10.002 --> 52:13.172
<i>Not mine. I love that tree.</i>

52:14.131 --> 52:17.510
What a genius.

52:19.762 --> 52:22.723
He's an absolute miniature
maestro of mayhem.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.852
He's exceeded
my wildest expectations,

52:25.852 --> 52:29.438
and he's playing into
my plan perfectly.

52:33.025 --> 52:33.985
Talk to me.

52:33.985 --> 52:36.612
The kid's belt
was delivered to the bird
as planned?

52:36.612 --> 52:38.364
Fantastic.

52:38.364 --> 52:42.326
I'm gonna bring a sleigh
full of Christmas chaos
to his next stop.

52:47.540 --> 52:48.541
But, you know...

52:49.876 --> 52:54.255
I'm curious to see
just how much more damage
our little dynamo could cause,

52:54.255 --> 52:56.424
if properly motivated.

52:58.134 --> 53:02.013
Yes, it's time
for the boy and I to tango.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.143
- But...

53:07.143 --> 53:08.644
Huh? I don't wanna waltz.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.187
It's... it's an expression.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.273
Never mind.
I wanna talk to the kid.

53:15.359 --> 53:18.112
That does it.
I'm moving to Metropolis.

53:28.873 --> 53:32.043
I know you're out here.
Show yourself.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.635
Victor.

53:41.886 --> 53:46.015
Tonight's forecast,
a freeze is coming.

53:46.015 --> 53:48.601
All these years,
you show up out of nowhere,

53:48.601 --> 53:50.186
that's your opener?

53:50.186 --> 53:54.273
What about,
"Tonight, hell freezes over?"

53:54.273 --> 53:56.692
Nope. Still lame.

53:56.692 --> 53:58.945
Dang it. It sounded better
in my head.

53:58.945 --> 54:00.488
Never mind that, Freeze.

54:00.488 --> 54:02.114
Why was I lured out
to the middle--

54:02.114 --> 54:03.699
Oh, wait, I got one.

54:03.699 --> 54:06.869
Time for you
to get ice-creamed.

54:28.140 --> 54:31.018
Answer me! Freeze!
Why did you bring me here?

54:31.769 --> 54:32.687
Whoa.

54:37.316 --> 54:38.776
Haven't you figured it out?

54:38.776 --> 54:42.279
We needed to get the Bat
out of Gotham.

54:42.279 --> 54:47.868
However, it appears
a much smaller Bat
has taken its place.

54:49.370 --> 54:50.579
Damian!

55:06.137 --> 55:08.305
We've looked everywhere.

55:08.305 --> 55:11.225
There's no sign of that van
or my belt.

55:12.018 --> 55:13.644
Earlier,
you remarked on the need

55:13.644 --> 55:15.855
to prove your readiness
to become a superhero.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.481
Prove to whom?

55:18.691 --> 55:19.734
To you.

55:19.734 --> 55:22.653
Uh, not you, my dad.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.363
So I am not dead.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.657
That is certainly welcome news.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.451
Sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

55:28.451 --> 55:29.618
It is not your fault.

55:29.618 --> 55:32.496
My central processing
made an erroneous assumption.

55:34.457 --> 55:36.250
- Observation.
- What?

55:36.250 --> 55:38.711
I may only be
a simulation of your father,

55:38.711 --> 55:41.255
but after an analysis
of his cognitive patterns

55:41.255 --> 55:43.758
in relation to your
current goal orientation,

55:43.758 --> 55:46.385
I have determined
that the two do not align.

55:46.385 --> 55:48.179
Wanna break that down, Bat-Dad?

55:48.179 --> 55:51.432
Getting your belt back
won't prove anything
to your dad.

55:52.850 --> 55:55.978
Maybe you think it won't,
but I know it will.

55:55.978 --> 55:57.313
It has to.

55:57.313 --> 56:00.775
Being Batman alongside my dad
is all I've ever wanted.

56:00.775 --> 56:03.569
I have to show Dad
I can handle myself.

56:03.569 --> 56:05.821
He worries way too much.

56:05.821 --> 56:09.325
He still makes me wear floaties
in the bathtub.

56:09.325 --> 56:12.161
I mean, come on.
I'm not a baby.

56:12.161 --> 56:14.455
Indeed. You are not a baby.

56:14.455 --> 56:17.041
You have been alive
for eight years.

56:17.041 --> 56:18.751
And four days.

56:18.751 --> 56:21.420
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

56:23.047 --> 56:24.215
I like this place.

56:25.091 --> 56:28.886
My memory matrix recalls
visiting many times
with my parents.

56:30.471 --> 56:31.889
I miss doing that with them.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.433
Why did they stop taking--

56:35.476 --> 56:37.686
Oh, right.

56:37.686 --> 56:39.605
Yes, right.

56:50.074 --> 56:54.036
It must have been really hard
to lose your mom and dad
when you were just a kid.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.874
Although the memories
are technically not mine,

56:58.874 --> 57:00.751
it was very hard to be alone.

57:01.627 --> 57:03.629
In fact, your father created me

57:03.629 --> 57:08.342
in part to ensure
you would never know
a loneliness like that.

57:08.342 --> 57:09.885
Wow, he did?

57:13.097 --> 57:15.558
Hey, Bat-Dad, observation.

57:15.558 --> 57:17.143
Yes, Damian?

57:18.227 --> 57:19.395
I'm glad he did.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.647
I wouldn't want to be alone
right now.

57:22.231 --> 57:23.732
I'm glad I am here, too.

57:24.859 --> 57:26.443
You're a good friend, Bat-Dad.

57:27.027 --> 57:30.072
I'd give you a big hug
if I wasn't, you know,

57:30.072 --> 57:31.407
wearing you.

57:31.407 --> 57:32.491
It's okay.

57:32.491 --> 57:36.036
Just promise to give one
to your father
when you next see him.

57:36.954 --> 57:39.582
Yeah, I kind of owe him
one anyway.

57:41.876 --> 57:42.710
What the--

57:47.131 --> 57:48.299
Whoo-hoo!

57:51.510 --> 57:53.971
Caution.
I'm detecting thin ice.

58:11.155 --> 58:15.034
My environmental
assessment system
indicates this may be a trap.

58:15.034 --> 58:17.578
I was thinking the same thing,
Bat-Dad.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.211
-  Oswald Cobblepot.
- Oswald Cobblepot.

58:25.211 --> 58:28.005
I prefer The Penguin.

58:28.964 --> 58:31.300
You have my belt, Birdbrain.

58:31.300 --> 58:36.138
My, my. He said
you were an obnoxious
little brat.

58:36.138 --> 58:37.139
Who said that?

58:40.559 --> 58:42.144
<i>Come now, Oswald.</i>

58:42.144 --> 58:45.022
<i>I never used
those words exactly.</i>

58:45.022 --> 58:46.357
Joker!

58:46.357 --> 58:49.109
<i>Oh, he may be obnoxious,
and he certainly acts
like a brat,</i>

58:49.109 --> 58:51.487
<i>but I never called him--
What was the last one?</i>

58:52.529 --> 58:53.489
<i>Oh, it'll come to me.</i>

58:53.489 --> 58:55.324
What do you want, Joker?

58:55.324 --> 58:58.661
<i>Oh, you know your Uncle Joker.
Always stirring the pot.</i>

59:00.454 --> 59:01.622
<i>Now listen carefully.</i>

59:01.622 --> 59:05.042
<i>You will never
get your belt back.</i>

59:07.044 --> 59:10.297
Caution.
Joker is a master manipulator.

59:10.297 --> 59:14.134
<i>Never ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, get it back.</i>

59:14.718 --> 59:16.220
Oh, yes, I will.

59:16.220 --> 59:17.888
<i>-Will not.</i>
- Will too.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.473
<i>- Will not.</i>
- Will too.

59:19.473 --> 59:21.475
<i>Will not infinity.
And don't say
infinity plus one,</i>

59:21.475 --> 59:22.559
<i>because I can do this all day.</i>

59:22.559 --> 59:24.645
Six weeks is his record.

59:24.645 --> 59:28.816
<i>And do you know
how I can be so sure
you'll never get it back?</i>

59:28.816 --> 59:32.528
<i>Because it is so clear to me,
and to everyone,</i>

59:32.528 --> 59:36.865
<i>that you simply don't have
what it takes
to be a superhero.</i>

59:38.701 --> 59:39.952
<i>I mean, look at your belt.</i>

59:39.952 --> 59:41.829
<i>It's right there,</i>

59:41.829 --> 59:44.832
<i>but I bet you couldn't
even snatch it
from old Penguin here.</i>

59:44.832 --> 59:48.210
<i>Weak, old, pathetic,
enfeebled, incontinent--</i>

59:48.210 --> 59:49.128
Hey!

59:49.128 --> 59:52.715
Oh, yeah?
Give me back my belt.

59:52.715 --> 59:53.799
Whoa! Easy, kid.

59:53.799 --> 59:55.592
You heard the clown.
I'm enfeebled.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.095
<i>Now, that's proper motivation.</i>

59:58.220 --> 59:59.346
<i>My work here is done.</i>

59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.181
This plan better work.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:02.599
All right, pipsqueak.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.101
Come and get it.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.653
Yeah!

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.130
Warning.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.549
Core processing unit damaged.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:37.968
So long, Bat-Brat.

01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:48.395
Merry Christmas, Gotham.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.233
Now, look at that.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.735
My ride's here.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.987
Toodle-oo.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.239
This ends now.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.825
Warning.
The damage I sustained

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.911
has compromised
the suit's integrity.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:07.831
Adjusting to compression
at this altitude will bring
power below critical level.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.416
Hang on.
We're almost there.

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.669
Got room for one more?

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.880
Huh? For such a little kid,

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.383
you sure are a pain
in the neck.

01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:19.593
-  Whoa.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:21.345
Whoa, whoa.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.681
23 skidoo.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.184
I bid you adieu.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:38.237
What? He's a freak
of nature.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.629
Whoa!

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.632
Warning.
Power levels
below critical.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.226
Let go, kid.
You'll kill us both.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.727
Give it to me! Give it to me!

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:11.728
Give it to me!

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.857
Fine. Take it.
I hope it was worth it.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.073
No!

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:25.909
What do I do? What do I do?

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.370
Solution.
Diverting remaining power

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.497
to my inflation systems
will break your fall.

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:32.082
But what will happen to you?

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.042
I am sorry, Damian.

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.253
I will not survive.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.754
No, you can't.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.423
I'm sorry.
I should have listened.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:40.841
You were right
about The Penguin.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.050
About everything.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.844
Please, no!

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.429
It's okay, Damian.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:50.267
Remember, an important quality
every good hero must possess

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.352
is the willingness
to make sacrifice.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:54.605
Bat-Dad, no!

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:55.856
Bye, Damian.

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:59.193
Initiating emergency
inflation protocol

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:00.944
in three, two...

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.537
Bat-Dad!

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:14.041
Damian, you will make
a great hero one day.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.544
Don't leave me.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:20.881
Before shut down.
I just want to thank you.

01:03:21.924 --> 01:03:23.133
For what?

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.928
Giving me warm memories
of my own.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.393
Bat-Dad.

there's reports of mass
destruction downtown

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.152
and a crime wave
all across the city.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.570
Calm down.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.323
I've faced situations
more dire than this before.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.040

that on in years.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.770

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.606

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.543
Wait, wait, no!

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.928
Santa.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.930
Oh, am I glad to see you.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.642
Hey, that's the kid

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.269
Way to go, jerk.

01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:59.187
You ruined Christmas.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:00.689
Wait, I can explain.

01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:03.525
I just wanted
to be a superhero.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.111
-  Get back here.
-  He's gonna pay.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.530
-  Where did he go?
-  Did you see him?

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.922
Dad...

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.382
I wish you were here.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:39.454
I'm just a kid. Don't hurt me.
I'm just a kid.

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:46.712
Alfred, what are you
doing here?

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:50.465
Did you forget?

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:55.470
Your steaming mug
of my world-famous hot cocoa
with extra marshmallows.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:59.933
Of course, that is,
unless you think cocoa
is kid stuff.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.105
- Ah, there now, better?

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.119
I'm in deep trouble, aren't I?

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.456
Oh, yes, most definitely,
Master Wayne.

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:24.291
Yeah. I figured.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.173
I just wanted
to be Batman so bad.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.760
Maybe if Dad didn't treat me
like such baby...

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.970
Don't be so hard
on your father.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.680
He can overdo it sometimes,

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.391
but that's because he's trying
to protect the one thing

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.268
you have that he never did.

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:45.395
A childhood.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.941
I'm no superhero.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:53.779
I lost my belt.
I destroyed my Batsuit.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:55.739
I have no idea
where I parked the bike.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.784
I can't blame anyone but me.

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:02.037
Son, costumes and belts
aren't what make a superhero--

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:04.581
I'm sorry. Did you say
you misplaced the Batpod?

01:08:05.874 --> 01:08:08.084
Um, never mind.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.796
Damian, becoming Batman

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:14.257
takes precisely what
your father has been
attempting to teach you.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:18.094
Focus, responsibility, sacrifice.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.639
Don't forget
high pain threshold.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.808
Indeed.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:26.520
And while you may not be
a superhero yet, little one,

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.981
in my heart,
I know one day you will be.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:31.733
Thanks, Alfred.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.568
But of course, my boy.

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:35.695
Now, come along.

01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:38.907

enough excitement
for one Christmas Eve.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.270
"Dear Little Batman,

Come in, come in.

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:13.645

but I'm taking you all in.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:31.663
Oh, please. Still trying
the hero thing, are we?

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:34.457
Did we learn nothing
from tonight, young man?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.458

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.376

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:39.129
just aren't cut out
to be heroes.

01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.880
Now, come enjoy the party.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.093
Tonight, my boy,
we're celebrating
something very special.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.805
Crime's triumphant return
to Gotham.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.265
And what better way to do it

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:53.685
than by stealing
its Christmas.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.314
This is where you say,
"Joker, you're mad.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.150
Steal Christmas? But why?"

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:02.736
Joker, you're mad.

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.070
Steal Christmas? But why?

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.197
It all goes back
to those glory days,

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:09.075
when my friends
and I would terrorize Gotham.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.747
Hey, get back here!
After them!

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:18.043
You'll get yours
in the end, Joker.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:20.628
-  <i>Oh, how we'd laugh,</i>

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:22.380
and laugh and laugh.

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:26.926
But then crime went away.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:30.555
We were forced to... retire.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.766
And as a result...

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.809
We drifted apart.

01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:37.353
<i>Gotham City just voted</i>

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.773
<i>the safest place

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:45.195
<i>Now, I always
thought the joy came
from committing crime.</i>

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:50.867
Looking back, it was about
committing crime together.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.870
Aw, you big softie.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:54.996
I don't understand.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.248
What does any of this
have to do with me?

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.293
The moment I saw
the sheer mayhem

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.879
you were capable of,
I realized that with your help,

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.631
we could kick
this whole groovy caper

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:06.341
up a notch and a half.

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:09.094
- High five!
- I'd never help you.

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.345
But you already did.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.848
Your chaotic bat-boobery
was a perfect distraction!

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.018
<i>While all eyes
were on you,</i>

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.394
<i>we nabbed Christmas</i>

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.106
<i>- from every home in Gotham.</i>

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:25.026
Oh!

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.085
<i>We set out
to only steal Christmas,</i>

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.628
<i>but you...</i>

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.547
<i>You destroyed it.</i>

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:49.425
<i>- And now, thanks to you,</i>

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.971
<i>everyone is waking up
to no Christmas.</i>

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.102
I was just trying
to get my belt back.

01:13:59.811 --> 01:14:02.897
And in the process of this
frankly, selfish pursuit,

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.608
you destroyed half the city.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.695
Now that doesn't sound
much like a superhero to me.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.614
In fact, it sounds more
like a super...

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.367
villain.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.369
What? No. No, I'm not a--

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.495
Sure, you are.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:19.622
Why do you think
I brought you here?

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.041
You're one of us, kid.

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:25.712
We couldn't have
done it without you.

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:28.840
Yes. Thank you,
from the bottom
of our cold hearts.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.467
Thank you, indeed.

01:14:35.013 --> 01:14:36.139
I can't believe...

01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:38.308
You're right.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.145
Only a supervillain would
ruin Christmas.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:44.981
That's right.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.858
To thank you
for your contribution,

01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:51.154
we thought it'd be real swell
if we all chipped in
and got you something.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.328
My utility belt.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:00.914
Your upgraded utility belt.

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.291
We replaced
all the useless safety gear

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:05.543
with more practical devices.

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.299
Well said, Bane.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:15.678
It's the perfect accessory
for supervillains.

01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:19.182
Think of all you went through
to get that belt.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.643
You earned it.

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:23.311
Take it.

01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.981
Take the belt!

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.693
Take the belt! Take the belt!

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.195
Take the belt!

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:40.870
<i>You must take my place
and become... the Batman.</i>

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:45.250
<i>Becoming Batman takes
precisely what your father</i>

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.960
<i>has been attempting
to teach you.</i>

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.464
<i>Give me the belt.</i>

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:53.341
<i>You're clearly
not ready for it.</i>

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:01.557
There now.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.144
Doesn't it feel good
to get what you want?

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.524
I guess you're right, Joker.

01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:11.025
I'm no superhero.

01:16:12.527 --> 01:16:15.488
But then again, I'm not
a supervillain, either.

01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:20.159
See, Joker,
being a superhero takes focus,

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.495
responsibility...

01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.875
and sacrifice.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.055
Holy crap!

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.517
All right. Which one of you
gave a little kid explosives?

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.521
It did seem like
a good idea at the time.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:56.821
That's not good.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.582
My snow globe! You broke it.

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:09.751
Now I'm gonna break you.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:12.045
You got it backwards,
clown face.

01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:15.214
I'm taking you down,
all of you.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:18.718
And I'm taking these presents
back to the kids of Gotham.

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:21.262
I'm saving Christmas!

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:24.390
You ungrateful, little twerp.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.143
I'm gonna chop you up
like sardines.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.946
- Hiyah!

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:41.657
- Play ball!

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.831
- Crush him, Bane.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:10.353
All you had to do
was take the belt,

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:13.064
and now I'm gonna
take your head.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:29.664
Looks like you're
in a little trouble,
Little Batman.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:40.174
No one poops
on my party and lives.

01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:42.760
Yes.

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:45.555
- What was that?

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:05.324
Dad!

01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.994
Thank goodness,
I found you.

01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:10.913
Are you okay?
You have any boo-boos?
Are you hurt?

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:13.458
Dad, I'm fine.

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.460
How very touching.

01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:17.920
Stand back, son.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.881
Why didn't you tell me
you were a father?

01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:21.132
I thought we were friends.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:23.050
I'm not your friend, Joker.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.344
I gotta say, love the beard.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.638
Really takes
the intimidation game
up a peg.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.931
- Thanks.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:35.938
Looks like it's time to kill
two bats with one stone.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:39.567
Dad, I can do this.

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:42.111
Almost makes me miss my father.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:45.406
But then I remember
how he dumped my bassinet
in the sewer!

01:19:49.494 --> 01:19:50.953
Just leave him alone.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.250
Come on, I've been fighting
these guys all day.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.752
Damian. I told you
to stay back.

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:01.172
Dad, listen to me. I can help.

01:20:01.172 --> 01:20:03.674
I said no, Damian.
You're just a kid.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.344
No, I'm not. I'm your kid, Dad.

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.855
Dad!

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.787
 Don't worry, Dad.
I'll protect you.

01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:34.664
- Nobody hurts my dad.

01:20:35.748 --> 01:20:36.707
- What?

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:37.792
Hiyah!

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.714
-  Not so tough
without these, are you?

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:51.389
You okay, Dad?

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.725
He... he is my kid.

01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:56.519
Batman is waking up.

01:20:57.478 --> 01:20:59.480
Leave my dad alone!

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:05.236
Dude! Damian, rad ninja skills.

01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:06.320
Thanks, Dad.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.823
Where's the belt?

01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:11.284
Long story.

01:21:11.284 --> 01:21:12.285
Tell me later.

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.536
In the meantime...

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.705
Whoa!

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:17.456
Your utility belt?

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:18.541
Awesome!

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:22.128
Wait. What about you?

01:21:22.128 --> 01:21:23.838
Always carry a spare.

01:21:23.838 --> 01:21:25.339
Told you,
you had a lot to learn.

01:21:26.132 --> 01:21:27.049
Now, what do you say?

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:28.926
You need a wingman?

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:32.888
- More like a sidekick.

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:37.810
Allow me to break the ice,
Little Batman.

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.937
Come on, kiddo.
Let's finish this.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:54.744
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.247
Oh, no.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.172
My back!

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.133
Hot enough for you?

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.302
Not even close.

01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:13.721
Where's the little one?

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.561
No!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.442
You two
look so cute together.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.861
I almost hate
having to blow you apart.

01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:33.324
Yeah, crush their stupid faces.

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.421
Uh-oh. Hit me, Damian!

01:22:48.506 --> 01:22:50.549
Careful. Don't poke
your eye out.

01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.595
A Merry Christmas
to me and to you,

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.347
a dark night.

01:22:58.557 --> 01:22:59.892
You missed!

01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:02.687
That's kind of the point.

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.772
Oh. Oh, right,
they're Batarangs.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.561
Merry Christmas.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.152
-  Ooh.

01:23:51.152 --> 01:23:52.445
Oh.

01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:55.239
<i>♪ Da-na-na-na-na-na ♪</i>

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.703
How many times
is he gonna fall in that junk?

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.706
Seriously, he should keep
a snorkel in his suit pocket.

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:07.126
Ready to go home
for Christmas?

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:10.212
Actually, Dad,
we have one last mission.

01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:31.525
Merry Christmas!

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:33.110
-  Look, it's Batman!
-  Batman!

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.696
- All right.
- Hey, it's our stuff.

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.615
My drum set!

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.992
A one, and a two,
and a joy to you.

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:43.537
All right, everyone.
Christmas is back on.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.674
Look, it's our presents.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.384
- Christmas is saved.
-  Oh, wonderful.

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.973
Go long.

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:12.733
Merry Christmas, Gotham City.

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:23.994
That would seem to be
all the presents, young sir.

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.205
Nope. Still one left.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.331
What's that?

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.792
- Merry Christmas, Dad.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:31.085
I owed you a hug.

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:33.379
Best Christmas gift ever.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:34.964
Hm, the price was right.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.799
- I beg your pardon, sirs,

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:38.175
but by any chance,

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:42.304
is there room for
an old Englishman and a tabby
in that embrace?

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.056
There always is.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.724
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:48.686
Damian, what's wrong?

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:53.274
I know it sounds silly,
but I kind of
feel bad for Joker.

01:25:53.274 --> 01:25:55.693
Feel bad for Joker?

01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:57.278
That sounds insane.

01:25:57.278 --> 01:25:59.154
I mean, he just
hit me in the head
with a mallet,

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.614
like an hour ago.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:01.657
I know.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:05.452
But all he wanted
for Christmas
was to not be alone.

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.456
My head still hurts, Damian.

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.709
- I mean, that mallet
was like this big.

01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:14.461
You know, Dad,
you both say
that you're sworn enemies.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:15.462
- But deep down,

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:17.715
I think you and Joker
really like each other.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.633
Damian, he's a supervillain.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:21.051
Mom's a supervillain.

01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:24.138
Mom's... complicated.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:26.015
A complicated supervillain.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.809
Hey, don't you start.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.645
Also, I hate the Joker.
