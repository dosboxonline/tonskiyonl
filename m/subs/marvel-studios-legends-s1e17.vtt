00:01.918 --> 00:03.920
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:18.351 --> 00:21.104
HILL: <i>Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:24.232
<i>Orphaned at ten when a shell</i>
<i>collapsed their apartment building.</i>

00:24.315 --> 00:25.316
(BOMB EXPLODING)

00:26.317 --> 00:29.279
HILL: <i>File says they volunteered</i>
<i>for Strucker's experiments.</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:31.948
STRUCKER: <i>It's not a world</i>
<i>of spies anymore.</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:33.825
<i>Not even a world of heroes.</i>

00:34.367 --> 00:37.078
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.583
<i>There's nothing more horrifying</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:43.918
<i>than a miracle.</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:49.716
ULTRON: <i>I have what the Avengers</i>
<i>never will. Harmony.</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:53.094
<i>You and I can hurt them.</i>

00:54.345 --> 00:55.472
But you...

00:56.222 --> 00:57.891
will tear them apart.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.691
(GRUNTS)

01:06.775 --> 01:07.776
(GROANS)

01:07.859 --> 01:09.277
You were pulling your punches.

01:14.449 --> 01:18.453
Mr. Stark would like to avoid the
possibility of another public incident.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.163
And what do you want?

01:20.705 --> 01:22.040
For people to see you...

01:23.041 --> 01:24.209
as I do.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.588
BARTON: <i>If you step out that door...</i>

01:29.422 --> 01:30.507
<i>you are an Avenger.</i>

01:32.592 --> 01:33.968
VISION: <i>Tell me what you feel.</i>

01:35.136 --> 01:36.846
I just feel you.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.389
(SCREAMS)

01:38.515 --> 01:42.018
Give up the stone, and she lives.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.186
Hands off.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.734
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.902
I can't.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.446
VISION: <i>If he gets this stone,</i>
<i>half the Universe dies.</i>

01:53.780 --> 01:55.240
<i>It shouldn't be you, but it is.</i>

01:58.076 --> 01:59.119
No!

02:16.177 --> 02:19.180
What are we looking at here?
Is it an alternate reality?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.933
Time travel?
Some cockamamie social experiment?

02:22.016 --> 02:23.268
It's a sitcom.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.481
<i>1950s, 1960s, and now the '70s.</i>

02:29.190 --> 02:30.859
Why does it keep switching time periods?

02:30.942 --> 02:33.319
And I can't believe
Wanda and Vision are having a baby.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.238
<i>-Time to start pushing. You ready?</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

02:35.321 --> 02:37.490
<i>-Push, Wanda. Push!</i>
-(GRUNTING)

02:38.366 --> 02:39.534
(BABY CRYING)

02:39.659 --> 02:40.702
DARCY: <i>Twins.</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:43.329
What a twist.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
(BABY CRYING)

02:45.874 --> 02:47.292
They finally fell asleep.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.501
VISION: They're empty.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.627
Mommy?

02:49.711 --> 02:50.795
Daddy?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.548
-Wait, now, hang on there a minute...
-Wait, no, no, no.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.842
-...you young whippersnappers.
-No, no, no!

02:56.551 --> 02:57.552
Oh!

02:57.635 --> 03:00.263
Let's just hope this dog
stays the same size.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.185
Our initial theory had Wanda Maximoff
as one of many victims.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.104
We now know
she is the principal victimizer.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.860
Jimmy. Jimmy, do you see that?
Something's happening!

03:13.943 --> 03:15.612
It's moving! Go, go!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.161
WANDA: <i>This will be your only warning.</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
Stay out of my home.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.541
You've taken an entire town hostage.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.169
I'm not the one with the guns, Director.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.504
But you are the one in control.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.133
MONICA: <i>He's gonna burn Westview to</i>
<i>the ground just to get what he wants.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:39.219
<i>Don't let him make you the villain.</i>

03:40.261 --> 03:41.512
Maybe I already am.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.889
Wanda, you have to...

03:42.972 --> 03:45.975
Young lady, I think you overstayed
your welcome.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.020
Poor Wanda's been through enough.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.272
Would you like a cup of tea, hon?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.690
-Sure. Thank you, Agnes.
-Okay.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.108
Sit down.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.155
Where are the twins?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.909
Oh! They're probably just playing
in the basement.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.744
(DOOR CREAKS)

04:05.453 --> 04:06.454
Tommy?

04:09.165 --> 04:10.166
Billy?

04:11.167 --> 04:13.169
AGATHA: Wanda, Wanda.

04:14.545 --> 04:18.466
You didn't think you were the only
magical girl in town, did you?

04:18.675 --> 04:19.801
(GROANS)

04:19.884 --> 04:21.302
(GRUNTS)

04:21.386 --> 04:23.096
I tried to be gentle,

04:23.846 --> 04:26.808
<i>to nudge you awake</i>
<i>from this ridiculous fantasy,</i>

04:26.891 --> 04:30.395
<i>but you would rather fall apart</i>
<i>than face your truth.</i>

04:30.478 --> 04:32.772
-BILLY: Mom! Please!
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

04:32.855 --> 04:37.193
You have no idea how dangerous you are.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.237
<i>This is Chaos Magic, Wanda.</i>

04:40.405 --> 04:44.033
<i>That makes you the Scarlet Witch.</i>

04:44.117 --> 04:46.619
I'm not a witch. I don't cast spells.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.788
<i>No one taught me magic!</i>

04:48.871 --> 04:52.208
AGATHA: <i>Your power exceeds</i>
<i>that of the Sorcerer Supreme.</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:56.629
<i>It's your destiny to destroy the world.</i>

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
(YELLING)

04:58.214 --> 05:00.925
Go! All of you, now. Go!

05:02.802 --> 05:03.803
(STRAINING)

05:05.179 --> 05:06.347
BILLY: Mom!

05:06.431 --> 05:07.557
-AGATHA: Now, do you see?
-Mom!

05:08.182 --> 05:10.435
You tied your family
to this twisted world,

05:10.518 --> 05:12.562
and now one can't exist without the other.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.688
-Mom!
-Mom!

05:13.938 --> 05:15.565
(STRAINING)

05:22.822 --> 05:27.493
AGATHA: <i>Give me your power and I will</i>
<i>correct the flaws in your original spell.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:31.706
<i>And you and your family</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:34.167
<i>can all live together in peace.</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:40.757
AGATHA: Runes.

05:40.840 --> 05:46.929
"In a given space, only the witch
who cast them can use her magic."

05:48.556 --> 05:49.724
Thanks for the lesson...

05:50.683 --> 05:56.773
But I don't need you to tell me who I am.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.652
AGATHA: <i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what you've unleashed.</i>

06:02.236 --> 06:03.863
I should've told you everything.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.367
-The moment I realized what I had done.
-It's all right, Wanda.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.202
<i>I know you'll set everything right.</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:10.661
<i>Just not for us.</i>

06:11.913 --> 06:12.914
WANDA: <i>No.</i>

06:13.998 --> 06:15.041
<i>Not for us.</i>
