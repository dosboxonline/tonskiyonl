Yukio Mishima was
Japan's most celebrated author.

00:35.146 --> 00:37.646
On his death, he left
a body of work consisting of

00:37.746 --> 00:42.246
35 novels, 25 plays, 200 short stories
and 8 volumes of essays.

00:42.346 --> 00:47.346
Both his personal life and artistic works
were closely followed by the general public.

00:47.446 --> 00:51.446
On November 25, 1970, Mishima
and 4 cadets from his private army

00:51.546 --> 00:54.046
entered the Eastern Army Headquarters,

00:54.146 --> 00:58.146
forcibly detained the commander
and addressed the garrison.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.361
Good morning.

04:17.567 --> 04:21.004
<i>Good morning, Mr. Mishima.
Would you like breakfast now?</i>

04:21.204 --> 04:23.069
Not today.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.032
What about the children?

04:25.242 --> 04:28.211
<i>Your wife's already
taken them to school.</i>

06:43.980 --> 06:48.713
<i>Recently I've sensed</i>

06:48.919 --> 06:52.616
<i>an accumulation of many things</i>

06:52.823 --> 06:55.917
<i>which cannot be expressed</i>

06:56.126 --> 07:00.256
<i>by an objective form like the novel. TO
SHINCHOSHA PUBLISHING CO. NOVEMBER 25, 1970</i>

07:00.630 --> 07:03.190
<i>Words are insufficient.</i>

07:05.068 --> 07:09.937
<i>So I found
another form of expression.</i>

07:27.858 --> 07:29.826
Is everything as planned?

07:31.928 --> 07:34.089
Read these in the car.

07:34.331 --> 07:35.992
I'll be right out.

07:46.143 --> 07:48.236
Did you get my letter?

07:49.045 --> 07:52.640
Don't worry. You'll find
our little drama newsworthy.

07:53.583 --> 07:57.383
And bring a photographer.

08:32.087 --> 08:35.854
<i>When I examine
my early childhood,</i>

08:36.058 --> 08:39.756
<i>I see myself as a boy
leaning at the window...</i>

08:41.231 --> 08:45.827
<i>forever watching a world
I was unable to change,</i>

08:46.036 --> 08:49.904
<i>forever hoping
it would change by itself.</i>

08:50.106 --> 08:53.007
<i>At seven weeks of age,
I was taken from my mother</i>

08:53.210 --> 08:55.576
<i>by my grandmother.</i>

09:00.984 --> 09:02.542
Close the curtain!

09:12.529 --> 09:15.726
<i>It's almost time</i>

09:15.932 --> 09:19.197
for him to visit his mother.

09:29.212 --> 09:33.911
No! I need him to rub my legs.

09:34.551 --> 09:38.817
Tell her
I'm too sick this week.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.819
Next week.

09:50.033 --> 09:53.196
You would have died

09:53.403 --> 09:55.803
in your mother's care.

09:58.475 --> 10:02.502
A delicate plant like you...

10:03.914 --> 10:07.315
must not go outdoors.

10:13.623 --> 10:17.218
If you want her so much,
just go!

10:18.061 --> 10:21.224
Leave me forever!

10:29.606 --> 10:32.905
Be a good boy
and rub my legs.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.020
That's wonderful.

10:47.691 --> 10:50.717
Only you can make
Grandma feel better.

11:05.675 --> 11:08.940
<i>I looked after
my grandmother's failing health.</i>

11:09.212 --> 11:12.978
<i>She entertained me with stories
and provided playmates.</i>

11:13.383 --> 11:16.181
<i>On special occasions,
she arranged</i>

11:16.386 --> 11:18.081
<i>trips to the theater.</i>

11:18.455 --> 11:19.979
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

11:20.190 --> 11:23.421
Don't apologize
to these commoners.

11:23.626 --> 11:26.117
Can you believe these crowds?

11:26.529 --> 11:28.963
When I was a girl,

11:29.165 --> 11:33.534
people still had
a modicum of manners.

11:36.573 --> 11:38.541
Eat your lunch.

11:39.009 --> 11:42.877
Look. All this riff-raff.

11:43.446 --> 11:46.210
You're just a fragile plant.

11:47.417 --> 11:52.912
The theater is very stimulating.
You're old enough to go now.

11:55.525 --> 11:58.824
It would have been too much
for you before.

12:00.730 --> 12:03.756
<i>The stage made everything
more beautiful.</i>

12:04.701 --> 12:06.601
<i>It turned men into women.</i>

12:06.803 --> 12:10.330
<i>It transformed the entire world.</i>

12:17.847 --> 12:19.246
Look this way.

12:21.618 --> 12:23.279
Look up, sweet.

12:25.522 --> 12:29.618
<i>When I was 12,
my grandmother, then dying,</i>

12:29.826 --> 12:31.821
<i>permitted me to return
to the care of my mother.</i>

12:32.095 --> 12:36.031
<i>Later that year
I entered middle school.</i>

12:47.544 --> 12:49.808
All right, you cowards!

12:50.013 --> 12:51.378
Who's next?

12:58.188 --> 13:00.213
Who is this? The poet?

13:00.423 --> 13:02.254
Mr. Tough.

13:11.167 --> 13:12.566
I'm shaking.

13:13.136 --> 13:15.001
- You'll get killed!
- Mama's boy!

13:28.685 --> 13:32.849
<i>In my earliest years,
I realized life consisted</i>

13:33.056 --> 13:35.456
<i>of two contradictory elements.</i>

13:36.326 --> 13:39.090
<i>One was words,
which could change the world.</i>

13:40.296 --> 13:45.233
<i>The other was the world itself,
which had nothing to do with words.</i>

13:45.435 --> 13:48.336
<i>For the average person,</i>

13:48.538 --> 13:51.302
<i>the body precedes language.</i>

13:51.508 --> 13:54.671
<i>In my case,
words came first.</i>

14:01.546 --> 14:07.046
<b>Temple of the Golden Pavilion
Published 1956</b>

14:08.124 --> 14:10.251
I can't hear
a word you're saying.

14:11.127 --> 14:13.891
Your name's Mizoguchi.
I know what you want.

14:15.365 --> 14:17.595
To be friends
because we're both cripples.

14:18.668 --> 14:21.796
Your stuttering
and my frog feet.

14:25.408 --> 14:27.501
That's all right.
I do too.

14:28.311 --> 14:31.303
You're still a virgin, right?

14:32.248 --> 14:34.113
Yeah, I thought so.

14:35.185 --> 14:37.050
No success with girls,

14:37.253 --> 14:40.654
and not enough guts
to go to a whore.

14:41.191 --> 14:45.924
If you're looking for another virgin,
you struck out with me.

14:48.898 --> 14:51.366
Stutter!
Go ahead and stutter.

14:51.935 --> 14:53.869
Virgins are beautiful,

14:54.070 --> 14:56.231
but there's nothing
beautiful about you.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.240
Guys like us

14:59.442 --> 15:02.468
are just like beautiful girls.

15:03.646 --> 15:06.911
We get sick
of always being stared at.

15:11.754 --> 15:13.688
It's like...

15:14.891 --> 15:18.850
a m-m-mirror...

15:19.829 --> 15:22.320
you can't b-b-break.

15:22.532 --> 15:26.662
You're so self-important.

15:27.937 --> 15:31.600
You make too big a deal
about your stuttering.

15:32.475 --> 15:35.273
I suppose you're a damn poet.

15:42.986 --> 15:45.921
G- G-Golden Pavilion.

15:50.193 --> 15:52.423
It's too beautiful.

15:56.332 --> 15:57.731
An acolyte.

15:57.934 --> 15:59.925
Even worse.

16:00.136 --> 16:04.266
Face the fact
you'll never be loved.

16:04.941 --> 16:07.501
It's the same for everybody.

16:09.879 --> 16:12.905
You can trick girls
into loving your deformity

16:13.116 --> 16:15.243
instead of hating it.

16:20.990 --> 16:23.458
Come on. I'll show you.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.345
Damn!

16:45.548 --> 16:47.482
You did that on purpose!

16:47.684 --> 16:48.912
What can I do?

16:51.354 --> 16:53.948
You just going to walk away?

16:57.527 --> 16:58.994
Help me up.

17:09.472 --> 17:12.031
Is there a doctor nearby?

17:12.241 --> 17:15.142
My house
is around the corner.

18:41.831 --> 18:43.799
<i>Suddenly I came across
a picture</i>

18:44.000 --> 18:49.267
<i>whose only purpose had been to lie
in wait for centuries and ambush me.</i>

18:50.973 --> 18:54.534
<i>The white matchless beauty
of the youth's body</i>

18:55.478 --> 18:58.914
<i>hung against the tree trunk,
his hands tied by thongs.</i>

18:59.215 --> 19:03.743
<i>I trembled with joy.
My loins swelled.</i>

19:04.287 --> 19:08.246
<i>My hand unconsciously began
a motion it had never been taught.</i>

19:12.562 --> 19:16.521
<i>My need to transform reality
was an urgent necessity,</i>

19:16.732 --> 19:20.862
<i>as important
as three meals a day or sleep.</i>

19:46.195 --> 19:47.958
Beautiful.

19:48.164 --> 19:50.428
Mm, really.

19:51.801 --> 19:55.430
Scenic beauty is hell,
isn't it?

19:58.307 --> 20:00.400
Take that one up the path
and screw her.

20:00.610 --> 20:02.510
She wants it.

20:05.181 --> 20:07.581
B- b-but how?

20:07.783 --> 20:10.980
Make her pity your stutter.

20:11.187 --> 20:14.918
Make her worship it.
That's why we're here.

20:20.396 --> 20:22.023
Stutter!

20:22.231 --> 20:25.894
Maybe she'll fall in love
with a stutterer.

20:26.369 --> 20:28.496
Do you stutter?

20:31.207 --> 20:33.869
Well, are all the deformities
here today?

20:34.744 --> 20:37.304
Let's split up.

20:37.513 --> 20:39.981
We'll meet here again
in two hours.

20:55.431 --> 20:58.457
D- d-do you want
to go home?

21:45.548 --> 21:49.541
He's gone off
and made her feel she's a saint.

21:49.752 --> 21:52.687
That's his usual trick.

21:56.993 --> 21:59.223
H- h-how do you know?

21:59.428 --> 22:01.020
Oh, come on.

22:01.597 --> 22:03.588
How do you think?

23:08.064 --> 23:10.328
What are you doing?

23:10.533 --> 23:12.558
What's wrong?

23:16.539 --> 23:19.167
Just as I thought.

23:40.496 --> 23:43.624
It seems you haven't
been going to school.

23:48.771 --> 23:51.035
Have you been ill?

23:54.744 --> 23:56.507
Master...

24:01.450 --> 24:05.648
That's no way
for a Zen acolyte to behave.

24:08.491 --> 24:10.721
Master...

24:16.165 --> 24:19.999
Nothing's that unbearable.

24:20.436 --> 24:22.336
You'll get over it.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.336
No. Everything...

24:28.244 --> 24:30.212
is p-p-powerless.

24:31.013 --> 24:34.278
What happened?
She ran away?

24:39.488 --> 24:43.584
It was as s-s-small as this
but grew so big.

24:45.761 --> 24:49.197
It filled the world...

24:50.466 --> 24:52.093
like tremendous music.

24:58.874 --> 25:03.743
That's the p-p-power...

25:05.314 --> 25:08.212
of beauty's eternity.

25:13.122 --> 25:15.613
It poisons us.

25:19.261 --> 25:21.456
It blocks out...

25:22.131 --> 25:24.190
our lives.

25:26.569 --> 25:28.833
Please, enough of your pride!

25:29.205 --> 25:32.538
Beauty is like a rotten tooth.

25:33.175 --> 25:35.803
It rubs against your tongue,
hurting,

25:36.011 --> 25:38.479
insisting on its own importance.

25:38.681 --> 25:43.380
Finally you go to a dentist
and have it pulled.

25:43.919 --> 25:48.413
Then you look at the small
bloody tooth in your hand

25:48.624 --> 25:51.923
and say,
"Is that all it was?"

25:52.394 --> 25:54.521
That's the way it is.

25:55.431 --> 25:57.262
Only knowledge

25:57.466 --> 26:00.731
can turn life's unbearableness
into a weapon.

26:02.004 --> 26:04.029
Beauty...

26:05.307 --> 26:07.036
is now...

26:08.010 --> 26:09.944
my enemy.

26:13.182 --> 26:16.310
Life is b-b-bearable
only when I imagine...

26:18.254 --> 26:20.449
the G-Golden Pavilion...

26:21.790 --> 26:23.758
has been destroyed.

26:30.199 --> 26:34.260
The American b-b-bombers
will come.

26:36.772 --> 26:38.296
Then...

26:40.376 --> 26:42.537
I'll be free.

27:05.034 --> 27:08.663
<i>When I was 18,
my class was assigned air-raid duty.</i>

27:08.871 --> 27:10.998
<i>I wrote short stories
and poems</i>

27:11.206 --> 27:13.834
<i>but dreamed only
of joining the war</i>

27:14.043 --> 27:16.011
<i>and dying for the emperor.</i>

27:16.211 --> 27:18.611
<i>I wanted to explode
like a rocket,</i>

27:18.814 --> 27:21.806
<i>light the sky for an instant
and disappear.</i>

27:22.818 --> 27:27.016
<i>I took the pen name
Yukio Mishima.</i>

27:42.738 --> 27:44.205
What are you doing?

27:45.741 --> 27:47.140
Nothing.

27:47.776 --> 27:51.234
I thought you were at Lit. Club.

27:51.447 --> 27:55.281
You kidding?
That mediocre bunch?

27:56.685 --> 28:00.348
You should try to make
more friends, sweet.

28:01.623 --> 28:04.387
It's not good
to be alone so much.

28:22.311 --> 28:26.042
" This is no precocious genius.

28:26.248 --> 28:29.843
He is not a writer.
And never will be. "

28:32.287 --> 28:34.312
What's this?

28:36.959 --> 28:39.860
That's a " respected" poet.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.163
He's talking about me.

28:44.233 --> 28:47.134
Don't show it to anyone else.

28:47.336 --> 28:51.432
They might agree.

29:28.077 --> 29:29.544
Cough.

29:32.181 --> 29:33.648
Enough.

29:38.220 --> 29:40.711
Do you sometimes cough blood?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.850
Yes, sir.

29:47.362 --> 29:49.421
How long have you had a fever?

29:49.631 --> 29:51.826
About six months, sir.

29:53.635 --> 29:55.830
" Unfit for military service. "

29:58.707 --> 30:02.006
" Incipient tuberculosis. "

30:05.214 --> 30:07.239
Get dressed and go home.

30:07.483 --> 30:08.848
Next.

30:24.466 --> 30:28.630
<i>I'd always dreamed
of dying on the battlefield.</i>

30:29.438 --> 30:33.169
<i>So why did I lie?
Why did I exaggerate my illness?</i>

30:34.176 --> 30:36.508
<i>My words were lies.</i>

30:36.712 --> 30:38.839
<i>I was a coward.</i>

30:39.414 --> 30:43.475
<i>I never really wanted to die.</i>

30:50.559 --> 30:52.891
Did you hear?
The war is over!

30:53.762 --> 30:57.755
B- b-but the American bombers?
Where are the bombers?

30:59.067 --> 31:01.035
The Golden Pavilion...

31:03.539 --> 31:05.905
who'll set it free?

31:21.857 --> 31:24.348
Did you steal this
from the temple?

31:25.494 --> 31:27.758
Be careful.

31:29.531 --> 31:32.557
You acolytes are
my girls' best customers.

31:41.109 --> 31:44.272
I wonder why
they didn't bomb Kyoto.

31:47.115 --> 31:49.208
That was your first time?

31:52.387 --> 31:54.480
I thought so.

31:55.557 --> 31:58.355
Don't worry.
You did fine.

32:02.664 --> 32:05.132
Are you always so serious?

32:06.101 --> 32:08.399
Didn't you enjoy it?

32:10.138 --> 32:12.732
I hope you remember my name.

32:13.875 --> 32:17.208
In a day or two
I'm going to be famous.

32:23.385 --> 32:25.114
What's so funny?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.481
You're such a terrible liar!

32:27.689 --> 32:29.953
And you keep
such a straight face!

32:31.460 --> 32:33.087
It's no lie!

32:34.396 --> 32:36.796
I'll make headlines.

32:41.570 --> 32:43.497
You're too much.

34:29.846 --> 34:34.946
<b>1- Art</b>

35:13.655 --> 35:15.145
Good morning.

35:15.557 --> 35:16.854
It's a nice day.

35:17.058 --> 35:19.322
Good morning, sensei.

35:23.632 --> 35:25.793
You've read the letters?

35:27.969 --> 35:30.833
You three must not
follow our example.

35:30.939 --> 35:32.531
But we're ready to -

35:32.741 --> 35:35.835
The letters are very clear.

35:36.044 --> 35:39.013
No matter what happens,

35:39.214 --> 35:43.617
make sure the general
does not commit seppuku.

35:43.819 --> 35:45.580
This is our day...

35:45.687 --> 35:47.621
not his.

35:47.823 --> 35:50.917
Sensei, we've talked it over.

35:52.093 --> 35:53.958
We want to die with you.

35:54.162 --> 35:56.130
Why must we be left behind?

35:56.598 --> 35:59.431
This is my final day.

35:59.701 --> 36:03.831
I've said good-bye to my parents,
my girlfriend, everyone.

36:07.409 --> 36:08.706
You...

36:08.910 --> 36:11.242
must stay alive.

36:12.280 --> 36:16.273
You must defend
our actions in court.

36:17.786 --> 36:21.051
We want to be with you
to the end.

36:21.957 --> 36:23.754
You refuse to obey orders?

36:30.398 --> 36:35.700
Morita and I are going to do our duty.
You must do yours.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.700
Understand?

36:42.110 --> 36:43.941
Don't worry.

36:44.145 --> 36:46.579
We'll meet again.

36:47.849 --> 36:49.646
Everyone ready?

36:53.188 --> 36:55.315
Let's go.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.029
<i>At the end of the war,
I felt left behind.</i>

37:43.371 --> 37:47.637
<i>I thought I was
the symbol of my times -</i>

37:47.842 --> 37:49.771
<i>a kamikaze for beauty.</i>

37:49.878 --> 37:53.612
<i>But I'd only been
a boy who wrote bad poetry.</i>

37:54.049 --> 37:59.214
<i>I quit my job at the Ministry of Finance
to become a writer.</i>

37:59.988 --> 38:02.183
<i>I wrote Confessions of a Mask
in six months.</i>

38:04.693 --> 38:07.025
<i>Thirst for Love
took five months.</i>

38:07.228 --> 38:10.163
<i>Forbidden Colors took nine,</i>

38:10.365 --> 38:12.162
<i>Sound of Waves four,</i>

38:12.367 --> 38:14.835
<i>Modern Noh Dramas three,</i>

38:15.670 --> 38:19.629
<i>The Temple
of the Golden Pavilion ten.</i>

38:33.455 --> 38:35.889
The rehearsals look great.

38:36.091 --> 38:37.718
Easy for you to say.

38:37.926 --> 38:41.157
Why worry?
You're already the youngest writer...

38:42.130 --> 38:44.257
<i>to publish
his Collected Works.</i>

38:44.466 --> 38:47.458
What good is it
if I'm not translated in the West?

38:47.669 --> 38:49.796
<i>Sound of Waves
was translated.</i>

38:50.005 --> 38:51.472
One book.

38:51.673 --> 38:54.733
Four, five languages?

38:54.943 --> 38:56.535
Six.

38:56.745 --> 38:59.680
It's like a dream come true.

38:59.881 --> 39:04.580
But it feels like being confined
to a hospital bed.

39:04.786 --> 39:06.754
A luxurious hospital bed.

39:06.955 --> 39:10.152
Can't I just have the bed?

39:15.196 --> 39:20.293
<i>Every night I return to my desk
precisely at midnight.</i>

39:29.844 --> 39:32.740
<i>I thoroughly analyze why I am
attracted to a particular theme.</i>

39:32.847 --> 39:36.305
<i>I drag everything
into my conscious mind.</i>

39:37.052 --> 39:40.351
<i>I boil it into abstraction.</i>

39:40.555 --> 39:44.958
<i>I am constantly calculating
until I sit down to write.</i>

39:45.160 --> 39:49.023
<i>Only then can my unconscious
dreams take over.</i>

39:50.946 --> 39:54.946
<b>Kyoko's House
Published 1959</b>

40:24.365 --> 40:27.596
Come, night! Come, Romeo!
Come, gentle night.

41:05.673 --> 41:07.573
Osamu?

41:09.611 --> 41:12.409
Who were you with last night?

41:12.781 --> 41:16.615
I don't remember.
Who'd you sleep with?

41:16.818 --> 41:19.946
What a thing
to say to your mother.

41:23.224 --> 41:25.215
Besides...

41:25.426 --> 41:27.394
he was too drunk to walk.

41:28.930 --> 41:32.297
Nothing goes right
for me anymore.

41:33.568 --> 41:37.197
You should see
the loan on this place.

41:38.072 --> 41:40.768
I can't even buy lipstick.

41:44.078 --> 41:46.273
My back gets worse and worse.

41:47.615 --> 41:51.278
I could die
and nobody would care.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.051
What's so funny?

41:55.623 --> 41:58.683
I love how you exaggerate
your misery,

41:59.260 --> 42:02.252
like some
cheap movie poster.

42:04.098 --> 42:06.566
You even look the part -

42:08.069 --> 42:11.766
like the madam
of a French brothel.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.308
How would you know?

42:14.676 --> 42:16.473
You've never left Tokyo.

42:17.679 --> 42:21.911
Besides, I'm not exaggerating.

42:24.252 --> 42:27.350
You're never here
when the loan sharks come.

42:27.455 --> 42:29.150
Do me a favor, please.

42:29.357 --> 42:31.951
Go see them.
I need six months more.

42:32.160 --> 42:35.357
It's getting
so I can't sleep anymore.

42:35.797 --> 42:37.025
I'm busy.

42:37.232 --> 42:39.427
Doing what? Daydreaming?

42:39.634 --> 42:40.601
Like you.

42:42.170 --> 42:43.237
Theater?

42:43.338 --> 42:44.596
Wait.

42:45.073 --> 42:46.438
Got a role?

43:09.597 --> 43:11.428
What do you think?

43:14.736 --> 43:16.966
Would they look good in tights?

43:17.472 --> 43:19.440
I guess so.

43:20.742 --> 43:23.176
This nail polish sure chips easy.

43:23.745 --> 43:25.645
These damn legs.

43:26.314 --> 43:28.805
I pay too much attention
to my face,

43:29.550 --> 43:31.450
but what about my body?

43:33.488 --> 43:36.013
If only I were more muscular...

43:37.158 --> 43:39.251
like a matador.

43:39.961 --> 43:44.159
Then my whole body
could be my face.

43:46.167 --> 43:48.897
That's not very realistic.

43:59.580 --> 44:01.810
I'm going to take up
bodybuilding.

44:06.254 --> 44:07.915
I mean it.

44:12.527 --> 44:14.961
Oh no, you don't.

44:15.163 --> 44:17.358
Then you'll have
more girls chasing you.

44:18.833 --> 44:22.132
Who were you with last night?

44:25.974 --> 44:29.603
Come on, tell me who.
Someone new?

44:30.411 --> 44:33.039
<i>All right, muscle man.
You are a weakling!</i>

44:33.247 --> 44:35.181
Cut it out.

44:38.519 --> 44:40.919
I'll be your mirror.

44:43.524 --> 44:46.118
This is your hair.

44:52.600 --> 44:55.694
This is your face.

45:00.141 --> 45:02.473
This is your breast.

45:03.544 --> 45:07.378
See? Isn't this better
than a mirror?

45:21.195 --> 45:25.564
<i>My life is in many ways
like that of an actor.</i>

45:25.767 --> 45:29.032
<i>I also wear a mask.
I play a role.</i>

45:30.104 --> 45:32.129
<i>When he looks in the mirror,</i>

45:32.340 --> 45:35.002
<i>the homosexual, like the actor,
sees what he fears most.:</i>

45:35.209 --> 45:37.507
<i>the decay of the body.</i>

45:48.322 --> 45:50.517
What's this?

45:50.725 --> 45:52.784
You're so flabby.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.507
Ah, it's you.

46:15.183 --> 46:19.745
<i>What happened?
Suddenly you just...</i>

46:20.955 --> 46:22.855
Don't worry.
It's nothing.

46:23.057 --> 46:26.515
<i>Please tell me,
or I'll never calm down.</i>

46:27.428 --> 46:29.828
<i>I'm calling from nearby.</i>

46:35.736 --> 46:37.795
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

46:41.609 --> 46:43.042
Tell me.

46:44.479 --> 46:46.208
I must know.

46:51.052 --> 46:55.250
Both you and I have
a strong sense of aesthetics.

46:56.357 --> 47:00.054
When you look in the mirror,
you see beauty.

47:07.869 --> 47:11.771
I can't even look at myself.

47:14.809 --> 47:18.575
So don't make jokes
like that again.

47:46.340 --> 47:51.073
<i>As the ship approached Hawaii,
I felt as if I'd emerged from a cave</i>

47:51.279 --> 47:54.715
<i>and shook hands with the sun.</i>

47:55.316 --> 47:57.648
<i>I'd always suffered
under a monstrous sensitivity.</i>

47:57.852 --> 48:03.017
<i>What I lacked was health -
a healthy body, a physical presence.</i>

48:03.224 --> 48:06.557
<i>Words had separated me
from my body.</i>

48:07.361 --> 48:10.819
<i>The sun released me.</i>

48:14.769 --> 48:20.230
<i>Greece cured my self-hatred
and awoke a will to health.</i>

48:20.908 --> 48:23.809
<i>I saw that beauty and ethics
were one and the same.</i>

48:24.011 --> 48:30.143
<i>Creating a beautiful work of art and
becoming beautiful oneself are identical.</i>

48:49.604 --> 48:53.597
<i>I obtained physical health</i>

48:53.808 --> 48:56.140
<i>after becoming an adult.</i>

48:56.344 --> 49:01.304
<i>Such people are different
from those born healthy.</i>

49:01.515 --> 49:05.212
<i>We feel we have the right
to be insensitive to trivial concerns.</i>

49:07.054 --> 49:10.615
<i>The loss of self through sex</i>

49:10.825 --> 49:13.953
<i>gives us little satisfaction.</i>

49:55.970 --> 49:57.699
Natsuo-chan!

50:00.708 --> 50:02.676
Osamu!

50:02.877 --> 50:05.004
Where have you been?

50:05.212 --> 50:07.180
I've become a bodybuilder.

50:07.682 --> 50:10.014
How about you?
Still painting?

50:10.217 --> 50:11.445
Still at it.

50:11.652 --> 50:15.213
You mean Natsuo Yamagata?
Landscapes?

50:17.158 --> 50:19.626
I've seen some of them.

50:22.296 --> 50:25.925
At least you don't attempt
to paint human bodies.

50:29.437 --> 50:31.234
Forgive his bluntness.

50:31.439 --> 50:35.739
Takei and I
were just talking about art.

50:37.044 --> 50:39.569
And what did you decide?

50:40.181 --> 50:44.880
I got interested because of the way
Michelangelo and Rodin

50:45.086 --> 50:47.953
treated the human body.

50:50.157 --> 50:53.285
The human body
is the work of art.

50:53.828 --> 50:56.592
It doesn't need artists.

51:00.134 --> 51:02.796
Okay, let's say you're right.

51:03.738 --> 51:06.138
What good does
your sweating and grunting do?

51:06.340 --> 51:09.605
Even the most beautiful body
is soon destroyed by age.

51:10.010 --> 51:13.343
Where is beauty then?

51:14.515 --> 51:17.549
Only art makes
human beauty endure.

51:18.285 --> 51:21.880
You must devise
an artist's scheme to preserve it.

51:23.023 --> 51:26.288
You must commit suicide
at the height of your beauty.

51:44.745 --> 51:49.079
What have you been doing?
You promised we'd go to the theater.

51:49.750 --> 51:51.513
You need money again?

51:51.719 --> 51:53.380
No, that's not it.

51:54.355 --> 51:56.687
Don't you notice anything new?

51:57.992 --> 51:59.482
<i>Just this awful shirt.</i>

51:59.693 --> 52:02.423
<i>You call my taste gaudy.
Looks like blood.</i>

52:03.030 --> 52:04.998
No, it's not that.

52:06.066 --> 52:08.432
I've put two inches
on my chest.

52:09.403 --> 52:11.894
Bodybuilding.

52:12.106 --> 52:14.074
You? Why?

52:14.275 --> 52:17.244
Somebody even said my ass

52:17.445 --> 52:21.211
looked like that
of a foreign sailor.

52:22.483 --> 52:24.474
Here, feel my chest.

52:26.086 --> 52:28.149
I can hardly pinch it.

52:30.958 --> 52:33.290
Lady! Get us some lunch!

52:36.163 --> 52:37.858
We only serve snacks.

52:38.065 --> 52:40.727
Then go get some.

52:40.935 --> 52:44.894
Until you pay back your loan,
this dump belongs to my boss.

52:45.105 --> 52:46.772
Now move your ass.

52:46.974 --> 52:48.441
The check!

53:30.484 --> 53:32.076
Come in.

53:40.494 --> 53:44.726
I hope you accept my apology.
I'm sorry about yesterday.

53:45.266 --> 53:47.996
I fired that punk immediately.

53:49.937 --> 53:53.566
I've put up with your mother
long enough.

53:53.774 --> 53:57.767
She's very difficult.

54:00.080 --> 54:03.311
I'll soon take possession
of her place.

54:05.119 --> 54:06.416
In such cases,

54:07.388 --> 54:10.414
people are often
driven to suicide.

54:21.201 --> 54:23.169
What do you mean?

54:25.472 --> 54:27.497
You're like me.

54:27.975 --> 54:30.170
My beautiful shadow.

54:30.945 --> 54:33.914
You're vain and bored.

54:34.982 --> 54:36.506
Full of yourself.

54:37.985 --> 54:40.249
You like to play
childish games.

54:40.854 --> 54:43.880
You're an actor, aren't you?

54:46.360 --> 54:48.055
I feel that...

54:51.265 --> 54:56.100
a certain woman
wants a certain something.

55:00.007 --> 55:02.202
Don't pretend you love me.

55:02.409 --> 55:04.206
I've had too much of that.

55:05.646 --> 55:09.776
Mm, as for me,
I don't love women much.

55:12.419 --> 55:14.785
They make me feel

55:14.989 --> 55:17.480
emptied out.

55:17.791 --> 55:19.986
All the better.

55:23.731 --> 55:27.599
What do you want?

55:34.708 --> 55:38.371
This is your mother's loan.
It comes to 11/2 million yen.

55:44.918 --> 55:46.681
Sign this.

55:46.887 --> 55:49.219
If you do,

55:49.423 --> 55:51.891
I'll cancel the loan.

55:53.460 --> 55:54.757
Write:

55:54.962 --> 55:59.422
" I hereby certify
that my life and body

55:59.633 --> 56:02.830
belong to Kiyomi Akita. "

56:08.409 --> 56:10.377
I want to buy you.

57:07.701 --> 57:09.896
It's just a little cut.

57:13.407 --> 57:15.739
Why?

57:17.611 --> 57:20.273
Your skin is so beautiful...

57:21.682 --> 57:25.778
I just had to cut it.

57:34.695 --> 57:37.095
It felt pleasant.

57:55.349 --> 57:59.809
A thought
just occurred to me.

58:01.889 --> 58:04.255
" This is the woman
I've been looking for.

58:04.458 --> 58:06.858
I've finally found her. "

58:10.697 --> 58:13.257
I don't need a mirror anymore.

58:15.602 --> 58:21.131
I feel clearly that I exist.

58:27.648 --> 58:29.138
In that case...

58:30.117 --> 58:32.677
will you stay by me to the end?

58:34.388 --> 58:36.515
Will you die with me?

58:38.458 --> 58:41.188
I'd watch you writhe
in a pool of blood...

58:43.463 --> 58:47.365
until you stopped moving.

58:49.870 --> 58:55.365
Then I'd drink poison.

58:58.245 --> 59:00.110
Fine with me, but...

59:01.748 --> 59:05.514
no matter what happens,
don't kiss me...

59:10.057 --> 59:12.423
until I'm good and dead.

59:50.097 --> 59:54.363
<i>A writer is a voyeur
par excellence.</i>

59:57.204 --> 59:59.798
<i>I came to detest this position.</i>

01:00:02.442 --> 01:00:07.141
<i>I sought to be not only the seer
but also the seen.</i>

01:00:07.547 --> 01:00:09.907
THE TOUGH GUY

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:17.914
<i>Men wear masks</i>

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:20.320
<i>to make themselves beautiful.
THE ASSASSINS</i>

01:00:20.527 --> 01:00:22.825
<i>But unlike a woman's,</i>

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:25.794
<i>a man's determination
to become beautiful</i>

01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:28.797
<i>is always a desire for death.</i>

01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:53.757
Have you been to the gym?

01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:57.524
I don't need to go.

01:01:05.439 --> 01:01:08.272
<i>You are in good shape.</i>

01:01:12.846 --> 01:01:14.814
Look, those ladies are jealous.

01:01:15.015 --> 01:01:17.984
They don't think
we're mother and son.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.117
Let 'em think what they want.

01:01:24.558 --> 01:01:26.185
Two, please.

01:01:26.393 --> 01:01:28.293
<i>Two hundred yen, please.</i>

01:01:29.363 --> 01:01:31.228
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:01:32.399 --> 01:01:35.926
It's such a relief not to worry
about money anymore.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:39.004
I'm finally able to sleep again.

01:01:39.206 --> 01:01:41.868
Thanks to Akita-san.
And to you.

01:01:47.414 --> 01:01:51.009
You're not having trouble
with her, are you?

01:01:51.618 --> 01:01:53.449
Not at all.

01:01:53.854 --> 01:01:56.618
In fact, I decided
to go all the way with her.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.121
Do you love her?

01:02:02.896 --> 01:02:04.420
Of course not.

01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:07.590
Isn't that a little extreme?

01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:11.100
On the other hand,
we've got to be nice to her.

01:02:13.073 --> 01:02:17.567
But don't go too far.
Just find a way to cancel the loan.

01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:23.745
Don't worry about money.

01:02:25.952 --> 01:02:28.284
I got a good part.

01:02:28.488 --> 01:02:29.955
You did?

01:02:30.824 --> 01:02:32.682
Which role?

01:02:35.529 --> 01:02:37.656
It's a surprise.

01:03:23.243 --> 01:03:26.110
You've got the body
of a matador.

01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:32.049
I can't even go to the gym.

01:03:35.856 --> 01:03:38.620
Those guys at the theater
are even worse.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:44.622
They're still having
the same boring discussions...

01:03:48.168 --> 01:03:51.069
about the "wounds of art. "

01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:03.111
I'd like to show them...

01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:06.680
your wounds.

01:04:40.153 --> 01:04:42.417
They don't even know

01:04:42.622 --> 01:04:45.785
that art is a shadow...

01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:51.856
that stage blood...

01:04:52.666 --> 01:04:55.260
is not enough.

01:05:20.546 --> 01:05:26.546
<b>3- Action</b>

01:05:28.602 --> 01:05:33.403
<i>When duty and sympathy</i>

01:05:33.607 --> 01:05:38.271
<i>Are on the scales</i>

01:05:38.745 --> 01:05:43.842
<i>A man always finds</i>

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:47.542
<i>Duty heavier</i>

01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:53.618
<i>O merciful Kannon</i>

01:05:54.094 --> 01:05:58.929
<i>My childhood friend</i>

01:05:59.266 --> 01:06:04.067
<i>You can see</i>

01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:08.071
<i>Right into my heart</i>

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:14.206
<i>The lion and the peony</i>

01:06:14.414 --> 01:06:19.511
<i>Roar on my back</i>

01:06:46.446 --> 01:06:48.880
There it is.

01:06:56.923 --> 01:06:58.618
We're a little early.

01:06:58.825 --> 01:07:00.656
Swing around the loop.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.762
What if something
goes wrong?

01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:07.758
Just stick to the plan.

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:33.446
<b>Runaway Horses
Published 1969</b>

01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:04.285
Has anything changed?

01:08:04.491 --> 01:08:06.925
You're still going
through with it? Why?

01:08:07.127 --> 01:08:09.095
Don't you understand?

01:08:09.729 --> 01:08:12.061
The emperor's face
is not pleased.

01:08:12.565 --> 01:08:14.294
Japan is losing her soul.

01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:16.528
But why you?

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.569
I was lucky enough
to be chosen.

01:08:23.676 --> 01:08:27.339
Why did you pull out
of the tournament?

01:08:28.448 --> 01:08:30.609
I lost interest.

01:08:32.385 --> 01:08:34.785
Because you win so easily?

01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:39.814
I lost interest
in wooden swords, sensei.

01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:42.187
They have no real power.

01:08:43.763 --> 01:08:45.924
You're old enough
for a sword of steel?

01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.599
Yes, sensei.

01:08:49.202 --> 01:08:51.670
How about your team
and your school?

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:54.997
They can't win without you.

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:57.471
Report to your dorm, Isao.

01:09:00.046 --> 01:09:04.475
Contemplate the danger of a man
who thinks only of himself.

01:09:21.234 --> 01:09:22.701
Excuse me, Lieutenant Hori.

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:29.272
I heard about
your kendo exercises.

01:09:29.475 --> 01:09:31.876
We expect
great things from you.

01:09:33.011 --> 01:09:35.173
You wrote this?

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:37.309
How many of you?

01:09:37.517 --> 01:09:39.006
Twenty.

01:09:53.265 --> 01:09:55.461
How will you do this?

01:09:55.668 --> 01:09:57.067
In a single stroke.

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:59.734
We'll assassinate
the leaders of capitalism.

01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:01.666
Burn the Bank of Japan.

01:10:02.475 --> 01:10:06.809
At dawn, law will restore power
to the emperor.

01:10:07.213 --> 01:10:09.272
What will happen
to your group?

01:10:10.383 --> 01:10:14.080
At sunrise, on a cliff,
paying reverence to the sun,

01:10:14.287 --> 01:10:18.053
looking down on the sea,
we'll commit seppuku.

01:10:23.329 --> 01:10:26.298
We'd never ask anyone
to join us in death.

01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:28.498
Who would you kill?

01:10:29.936 --> 01:10:31.665
If we could kill ten,

01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:35.773
<i>Marquis Nagasaki,
Baron Shinkawa -</i>

01:10:35.975 --> 01:10:37.567
If only five?

01:10:37.777 --> 01:10:38.869
Premier Saito -

01:10:39.078 --> 01:10:40.705
Only one?

01:10:42.949 --> 01:10:44.812
Kurahara.

01:10:46.286 --> 01:10:49.153
Japan will be purified.

01:10:51.624 --> 01:10:53.592
What do you want from me?

01:10:54.427 --> 01:10:56.588
An airplane to drop leaflets.

01:10:56.796 --> 01:11:00.357
Explosives to knock out
the power station.

01:11:00.567 --> 01:11:02.057
You have firearms?

01:11:02.268 --> 01:11:04.259
We'll only use swords.

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:07.598
Our best weapon is purity.

01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:11.337
And you schoolboys
can use swords?

01:12:18.077 --> 01:12:20.671
<i>Words are a deceit.</i>

01:12:22.348 --> 01:12:24.873
<i>But action is never deceitful.</i>

01:12:25.885 --> 01:12:28.251
<i>" The harmony of pen and sword. "</i>

01:12:28.454 --> 01:12:30.979
<i>This samurai motto
used to be a way of life.</i>

01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:36.060
<i>Now it's forgotten.</i>

01:12:36.262 --> 01:12:39.231
<i>Can art and action
still be united?</i>

01:12:40.066 --> 01:12:45.163
<i>Today this harmony can only occur
in a brief flash, a single moment.</i>

01:12:46.873 --> 01:12:51.273
<i>The average age for men
in the Bronze Age was 18,</i>

01:12:51.377 --> 01:12:54.278
<i>in the Roman era, 22.</i>

01:12:54.647 --> 01:12:58.406
<i>Heaven must have been
beautiful then.</i>

01:12:59.285 --> 01:13:02.686
<i>Today it must look dreadful.</i>

01:13:03.823 --> 01:13:08.860
<i>When a man reaches 40,
he has no chance to die beautifully.</i>

01:13:08.961 --> 01:13:12.419
<i>No matter how he tries,
he will die of decay.</i>

01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:18.735
<i>He must compel himself
to live.</i>

01:13:31.651 --> 01:13:32.982
What's wrong?

01:13:33.186 --> 01:13:34.915
Call off your plan.

01:13:35.121 --> 01:13:36.315
Someone found out?

01:13:36.522 --> 01:13:39.047
No, but they will.

01:13:39.559 --> 01:13:42.858
I'm being transferred
to Manchuria.

01:13:43.062 --> 01:13:44.825
Without me,
it's too dangerous.

01:13:45.498 --> 01:13:48.365
Can you get the airplane?

01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:50.536
It won't work.
Call it off.

01:13:52.772 --> 01:13:54.467
Why?

01:13:55.007 --> 01:13:58.670
You must not
throw away your lives.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:09.246
" Don't fear the death of the body,
only the spirit. "

01:14:10.223 --> 01:14:13.590
Your intentions
are admirable, but...

01:14:19.232 --> 01:14:22.497
Please swear you'll call it off.

01:14:35.014 --> 01:14:38.048
And destroy
any reference to me.

01:14:38.284 --> 01:14:40.047
Do you swear?

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:57.030
There'll be no airplane,
no explosives.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.330
The army has deserted us.

01:15:01.174 --> 01:15:04.302
The capitalists
have bought them out.

01:15:06.546 --> 01:15:09.982
This meeting is useless.

01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:13.282
Do you understand?

01:15:13.653 --> 01:15:15.678
Go home.
Go back to your books.

01:15:16.389 --> 01:15:19.381
This is my final command.

01:15:20.626 --> 01:15:23.151
I want to be alone now. Go.

01:15:42.648 --> 01:15:44.411
What's wrong?

01:15:44.784 --> 01:15:47.252
Didn't you hear me?
Go home.

01:15:48.387 --> 01:15:50.480
We have no plan.

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.249
No hope. Nothing.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.257
We understand.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.292
Are you still willing
to pay the price...

01:16:01.734 --> 01:16:06.467
for something which may
accomplish nothing?

01:16:06.672 --> 01:16:08.105
Yes!

01:16:24.357 --> 01:16:27.224
One: We vow
to go forth to death

01:16:27.327 --> 01:16:30.254
to purge our nation
of capitalist evils.

01:16:30.263 --> 01:16:33.391
Two: We hereby vow to forge

01:16:33.599 --> 01:16:35.499
eternal friendship
among ourselves.

01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:41.003
Three: We hereby vow
to restore His Imperial Majesty.

01:16:44.543 --> 01:16:49.947
"We hereby vow to be
the foundation of imperial Japan. "

01:16:51.384 --> 01:16:53.818
Now let's sign with our blood.

01:16:55.388 --> 01:16:58.915
This paper could be
lost in the wind,

01:17:00.026 --> 01:17:04.827
but these vows
will be eternal in our hearts.

01:17:20.746 --> 01:17:22.407
It doesn't hurt.

01:18:00.252 --> 01:18:02.049
After the signatures,

01:18:02.254 --> 01:18:06.020
we'll drink a blood toast
to our new Shield Society.

01:18:15.534 --> 01:18:19.231
No one here has VD, I hope.

01:19:24.203 --> 01:19:27.372
You can't use the National Theater
for a private political party.

01:19:27.473 --> 01:19:29.703
This is a scandal.

01:19:31.243 --> 01:19:34.644
What's all this nonsense
about a private army?

01:19:35.147 --> 01:19:37.980
Up there I create
action in the sunshine.

01:19:38.184 --> 01:19:40.846
Here I create
art in the dark.

01:19:41.053 --> 01:19:42.782
Isn't it perfect?

01:19:42.988 --> 01:19:45.684
Who'd have thought
you could still combine them?

01:19:45.891 --> 01:19:49.825
Byron did it.
He had 300 men.

01:19:49.929 --> 01:19:51.794
Are you serious?

01:19:51.997 --> 01:19:54.557
The media can make you look
so ridiculous.

01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:57.292
You're our best writer.

01:19:58.537 --> 01:20:00.903
Haven't I always
looked ridiculous?

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.473
I walk on stage determined
to make the audience cry.

01:20:04.677 --> 01:20:07.111
Instead,
they burst out laughing.

01:20:14.987 --> 01:20:17.217
<i>Some people have called us</i>

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:20.188
toy soldiers.

01:20:20.392 --> 01:20:23.623
But our goal

01:20:23.829 --> 01:20:26.127
is to restore
the noble tradition

01:20:26.332 --> 01:20:29.699
of the way of the samurai.

01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:35.464
I have always supported
the tradition of elegant beauty

01:20:35.574 --> 01:20:38.336
in Japanese literature.

01:20:38.544 --> 01:20:40.512
I cannot stop striving

01:20:40.713 --> 01:20:45.047
to unite these two
great traditions.

01:20:51.257 --> 01:20:54.820
Now I would like to address

01:20:55.127 --> 01:20:58.460
our foreign guests in English.

01:20:59.698 --> 01:21:03.691
I hope my poor English
is not too hard

01:21:03.903 --> 01:21:05.871
on your ears.

01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:10.961
<i>A month after the radical Left
occupied Tokyo University,</i>

01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:14.901
<i>they challenged me to speak.</i>

01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:20.467
<i>For a moment I felt I was entering
the realm where art and action converge.</i>

01:22:20.579 --> 01:22:23.070
<i>For a moment I was alive.</i>

01:22:33.525 --> 01:22:36.085
You're not only wrong,

01:22:36.295 --> 01:22:38.326
you're not even logical!

01:22:45.104 --> 01:22:48.130
Having got this far
out of sheer pride...

01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:54.345
I'm not going
to become logical now.

01:22:59.351 --> 01:23:02.548
<i>That doesn't mean you've defeated me
with your lack of logic.</i>

01:23:03.155 --> 01:23:05.453
I'd gladly join hands with you

01:23:05.658 --> 01:23:08.821
if you'd only call the emperor
by his rightful name.

01:23:17.836 --> 01:23:20.862
We all want to improve Japan.

01:23:24.043 --> 01:23:26.834
Are we so far apart?

01:23:30.716 --> 01:23:33.378
We're playing a serious game.

01:23:33.585 --> 01:23:36.213
We've both played the same cards.

01:23:39.425 --> 01:23:42.656
You're speaking nonsense!

01:23:42.861 --> 01:23:45.659
Think about it.

01:23:47.032 --> 01:23:50.593
But I have the joker.

01:23:53.305 --> 01:23:56.900
I have the emperor.

01:24:11.623 --> 01:24:13.591
<i>Sitting alone at my desk
at midnight,</i>

01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:16.488
<i>as I had every night
for 20 years,</i>

01:24:16.695 --> 01:24:20.028
<i>I felt empty.</i>

01:24:21.266 --> 01:24:23.894
<i>Then again came the words.</i>

01:24:24.103 --> 01:24:27.095
<i>Effortlessly, urgently.</i>

01:24:27.306 --> 01:24:32.403
<i>Again the rehearsal began.</i>

01:24:39.118 --> 01:24:41.086
We strike Friday night.

01:24:41.286 --> 01:24:45.620
This date can change anytime,
so always be ready.

01:24:52.131 --> 01:24:54.190
Are there any objections?

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:57.598
Is it inconvenient for anyone?

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.599
If we're going to die,
how can it be inconvenient?

01:25:08.514 --> 01:25:10.880
Okay, Friday night.

01:25:12.284 --> 01:25:15.378
Where are the maps
to Kurahara's house?

01:25:19.425 --> 01:25:21.052
Is that you?

01:26:05.003 --> 01:26:06.834
Sit down.

01:26:13.779 --> 01:26:16.805
Are you hungry?

01:26:17.015 --> 01:26:18.073
No.

01:26:20.619 --> 01:26:23.850
- I can have something brought.
- That's okay.

01:26:24.923 --> 01:26:28.359
- Did your group plan anything else?
- No.

01:26:29.862 --> 01:26:32.387
You're third degree
in kendo, I hear.

01:26:32.598 --> 01:26:36.694
Too bad you got involved
in this business.

01:26:36.902 --> 01:26:39.962
<i>Otherwise we might be having
a pleasant match.</i>

01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:42.264
Are they having a match now?

01:26:46.512 --> 01:26:50.414
You're still
too young and pure.

01:26:51.316 --> 01:26:54.410
You will learn
to tone down your feelings.

01:26:55.087 --> 01:26:59.217
If purity is toned down,
it's no longer purity.

01:26:59.424 --> 01:27:02.086
Total purity is not possible
in this world.

01:27:02.294 --> 01:27:03.261
Yes, it is...

01:27:04.997 --> 01:27:10.060
if you turn your life into a line of poetry
written with a splash of blood.

01:27:10.269 --> 01:27:11.759
Calm down.

01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:15.269
Dying isn't everything,
you know.

01:27:16.241 --> 01:27:21.076
I admire your loyalty,
but the emperor also treasures our lives.

01:27:23.482 --> 01:27:25.746
I'm not attacking your beliefs.

01:27:25.951 --> 01:27:28.476
I'm just saying...

01:27:29.855 --> 01:27:31.413
take it easy.

01:27:31.523 --> 01:27:33.350
You don't think I'm serious.

01:27:33.458 --> 01:27:36.053
If my ideas aren't dangerous,
let me do my duty.

01:27:36.328 --> 01:27:39.320
If not, torture me
like the others.

01:27:40.165 --> 01:27:42.326
Ah, such a debater.

01:27:42.534 --> 01:27:44.502
Torture me.

01:27:44.703 --> 01:27:48.969
There's no need
to torture you.

01:27:49.174 --> 01:27:52.007
We torture those
who won't talk.

01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:54.007
<i>You want to talk.</i>

01:29:19.965 --> 01:29:20.897
Kurahara!

01:29:21.099 --> 01:29:22.430
Who are you?

01:29:22.634 --> 01:29:24.898
The punishment you deserve!

01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:26.656
Cut!

01:30:42.347 --> 01:30:44.244
Is something wrong?

01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:46.315
How does it look?

01:30:46.518 --> 01:30:47.610
Fine.

01:30:47.819 --> 01:30:50.319
It's hard enough
directing and acting.

01:30:50.422 --> 01:30:52.253
It looks great. Honest.

01:30:52.457 --> 01:30:53.924
Very well.

01:30:56.228 --> 01:30:57.889
We need more shadow.

01:30:58.096 --> 01:31:02.829
This premieres in Paris -
you know how the French love shadows.

01:31:29.494 --> 01:31:31.155
Action!

01:31:32.397 --> 01:31:35.332
Why did you make your film
without dialogue?

01:31:36.101 --> 01:31:38.535
That's a surprise.

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:43.864
<i>You always say I use too much dialogue.
I was doing you a favor.</i>

01:31:46.111 --> 01:31:49.080
Does your film
have any political message?

01:31:49.648 --> 01:31:51.741
No, none at all.

01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:53.577
Your favorite writer?

01:31:53.785 --> 01:31:55.946
<i>- Thomas Mann.
- Your most unique habit?</i>

01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:58.379
Laughing for no reason.

01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:00.922
Who would you like to be?

01:32:03.862 --> 01:32:06.797
Elvis Presley.

01:32:09.467 --> 01:32:12.630
Your favorite food?

01:32:13.004 --> 01:32:17.031
Does this mean
you'll stop writing novels?

01:32:17.242 --> 01:32:19.210
I can't help you out on that.

01:32:19.411 --> 01:32:21.675
I couldn't survive
if I didn't continue

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.646
writing one more line,
one more line, one more line...

01:32:26.918 --> 01:32:28.886
one more line.

01:32:29.855 --> 01:32:31.447
And one more line.

01:32:56.646 --> 01:33:02.946
<b>4- Harmony of Pen and Sword</b>

01:33:16.434 --> 01:33:18.459
Just follow the plan.

01:33:21.206 --> 01:33:23.333
But what if we can't?

01:33:23.541 --> 01:33:24.940
Watch me.

01:33:25.777 --> 01:33:30.043
If something goes wrong,
I'll give you a signal.

01:33:31.783 --> 01:33:33.944
Now is the time to be calm.

01:33:37.255 --> 01:33:38.517
Let's go.

01:33:48.133 --> 01:33:49.532
We're here to see
General Mashita.

01:33:49.734 --> 01:33:50.860
You have an...?

01:33:52.237 --> 01:33:53.727
11:00 a. m.

01:33:55.607 --> 01:33:57.632
Ah, Mishima-sensei!

01:33:57.842 --> 01:33:59.309
Just a moment.

01:34:07.285 --> 01:34:08.252
Go ahead.

01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:18.412
<i>Running in the early mist
with the members of the Shield Society,</i>

01:35:18.623 --> 01:35:24.186
<i>I felt something emerging
as slowly as my sweat.:</i>

01:35:25.463 --> 01:35:29.695
<i>the ultimate verification
of my existence.</i>

01:35:33.371 --> 01:35:36.704
<i>Our members were allowed to train
in the facilities of the regular army.</i>

01:35:36.908 --> 01:35:40.241
<i>I flew in a combat fighter.</i>

01:35:41.146 --> 01:35:42.805
<i>These privileges
were granted us</i>

01:35:42.915 --> 01:35:45.406
<i>because of the symbolic
significance of our society.</i>

01:35:45.617 --> 01:35:49.951
<i>Even in its present
weakened condition,</i>

01:35:50.488 --> 01:35:54.185
<i>the army represented
the ancient code of the samurai.</i>

01:35:54.392 --> 01:36:00.456
<i>It was here,
on the stage of Japanese tradition,</i>

01:36:00.665 --> 01:36:03.429
<i>that I would conduct my action.</i>

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:10.105
Look at that!

01:36:12.377 --> 01:36:16.541
<i>At least he can eat
faster than this old man.</i>

01:36:17.449 --> 01:36:19.440
All right: Eat!

01:36:19.918 --> 01:36:23.319
Hup-two-three-four.

01:36:45.009 --> 01:36:46.977
Can't see Fuji at all.

01:36:51.316 --> 01:36:54.683
Morita, what do you think?

01:36:57.188 --> 01:36:59.452
Their hearts are pure.

01:37:04.028 --> 01:37:05.757
Yes. Are they " strong" enough?

01:37:20.945 --> 01:37:23.106
<i>Having come to my solution,</i>

01:37:23.314 --> 01:37:26.181
<i>I never wavered.</i>

01:37:26.584 --> 01:37:29.519
<i>Who knows what others
will make of this?</i>

01:37:30.555 --> 01:37:33.149
<i>There would be
no more rehearsals.</i>

01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:42.899
General Mashita
is waiting for you.

01:38:15.667 --> 01:38:18.192
General,
Mishima-sensei is here.

01:38:20.538 --> 01:38:22.130
Yes, come right in.

01:38:28.479 --> 01:38:30.879
General,
good to see you again.

01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:33.378
You too.

01:38:33.585 --> 01:38:37.544
May I invite some members
of the Shield Society to join us?

01:38:37.755 --> 01:38:39.245
Certainly.

01:38:39.457 --> 01:38:40.685
You don't mind?

01:38:43.361 --> 01:38:44.851
Come in.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.630
Please sit down.

01:38:57.842 --> 01:39:01.938
We've just finished
a maneuver.

01:39:02.146 --> 01:39:05.775
These four
distinguished themselves.

01:39:05.984 --> 01:39:07.508
I see.

01:39:07.719 --> 01:39:09.983
I wanted them

01:39:10.188 --> 01:39:13.214
to have the honor
of meeting you.

01:39:13.424 --> 01:39:15.790
That's why we're in uniform.

01:39:17.262 --> 01:39:18.229
Please sit down.

01:39:28.773 --> 01:39:30.798
Your new uniforms

01:39:31.009 --> 01:39:32.374
are very handsome.

01:39:32.577 --> 01:39:34.738
Really splendid.

01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.245
Who designed them? You?

01:39:37.448 --> 01:39:40.611
Yes - with some help
from De Gaulle's tailor.

01:39:49.294 --> 01:39:50.852
Is that real?

01:39:51.829 --> 01:39:53.126
Yes.

01:39:53.331 --> 01:39:56.767
Is it all right
to carry it around like that?

01:39:56.968 --> 01:39:59.198
I have a permit.

01:39:59.404 --> 01:40:02.965
It's a certified antique,
made in 1620 by Seki-no-Magoroku.

01:40:03.174 --> 01:40:05.734
Would you like to see it?
- By all means.

01:40:26.264 --> 01:40:28.391
Magnificent.

01:40:31.636 --> 01:40:34.628
As I expected,
it has the wave pattern.

01:40:35.206 --> 01:40:37.003
You must be an expert.

01:40:37.342 --> 01:40:39.242
Wonderful.

01:40:39.977 --> 01:40:42.571
It's hard to see through the oil.

01:40:46.017 --> 01:40:47.882
Polishing cloth.

01:40:48.953 --> 01:40:50.980
There's a cloth over here.

01:41:07.472 --> 01:41:09.440
A true museum piece.

01:41:21.886 --> 01:41:23.517
The cloth.

01:41:29.694 --> 01:41:31.423
Stop joking around!

01:41:33.164 --> 01:41:36.622
Be quiet
and you won't be injured.

01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:01.315
Barricade the doors.
Quick!

01:42:38.663 --> 01:42:40.255
Put your hachimaki on.

01:42:57.148 --> 01:42:58.945
Remove the gag.

01:43:04.689 --> 01:43:07.021
If this is a demonstration

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:10.155
of commando tactics,
it's gone far enough.

01:43:16.067 --> 01:43:19.002
Tell the garrison
to assemble out front

01:43:19.203 --> 01:43:21.262
to hear a speech.

01:43:23.341 --> 01:43:25.002
Are you serious?

01:43:25.576 --> 01:43:27.207
Are you crazy?

01:43:28.479 --> 01:43:32.506
If you do, we will surrender
our weapons after the speech.

01:43:32.617 --> 01:43:34.375
Stop playacting.

01:43:34.485 --> 01:43:37.477
I can't approve a speech
until I've read it.

01:43:37.955 --> 01:43:41.755
If you try to stop us,
I will kill you and commit seppuku.

01:43:42.126 --> 01:43:43.923
This is madness.

01:43:44.495 --> 01:43:46.292
What will you gain?

01:43:46.497 --> 01:43:48.795
Order your officers to obey.

01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:53.994
These are our demands.

01:43:54.872 --> 01:43:57.602
" One: The men
of the 32nd garrison

01:43:57.808 --> 01:43:59.241
will be assembled

01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:02.643
at 11:30 a. m.

01:44:02.847 --> 01:44:07.079
Two: Commander Mishima
will address the garrison. "

01:44:33.978 --> 01:44:34.842
Out!

01:44:35.379 --> 01:44:36.978
Get out!

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.984
<i>Release the general!</i>

01:44:49.827 --> 01:44:51.260
Who's in charge?

01:44:51.462 --> 01:44:53.089
Who's in command?

01:44:53.297 --> 01:44:56.494
I am the colonel.
Let me see the general.

01:44:57.001 --> 01:44:58.992
Listen to our demands.

01:45:02.039 --> 01:45:04.030
I guarantee
the general's safety.

01:45:04.942 --> 01:45:06.809
Let's talk this over.

01:45:07.912 --> 01:45:10.005
There's nothing to talk about!

01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:16.550
One: The men of the 32nd garrison
will be assembled

01:45:16.754 --> 01:45:19.552
<i>in front of headquarters
at 11:30 a. m.</i>

01:45:19.757 --> 01:45:22.658
<i>Two: Commander Mishima
will address the garrison.</i>

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:24.384
<i>Three: The garrison</i>

01:45:24.595 --> 01:45:27.428
will attend
the speech in silence.

01:45:27.632 --> 01:45:29.361
We agree.

01:45:29.834 --> 01:45:31.802
But it's already past 11:30.

01:45:32.003 --> 01:45:33.903
When shall they assemble?

01:45:36.307 --> 01:45:37.833
Immediately!

01:45:46.384 --> 01:45:48.311
Assemble the garrison.

01:46:57.321 --> 01:46:59.048
<i>Come out here!</i>

01:46:59.323 --> 01:47:01.689
<i>Come down!</i>

01:47:03.327 --> 01:47:05.352
<i>The police are everywhere.</i>

01:47:05.996 --> 01:47:09.762
Our little drama has attracted
quite an audience.

01:47:21.278 --> 01:47:23.369
Time for the last act.

01:48:05.322 --> 01:48:07.620
Dear soldiers!

01:48:07.825 --> 01:48:10.794
It's a terrible affair
to have to speak

01:48:10.995 --> 01:48:13.555
to army men

01:48:13.764 --> 01:48:17.325
in circumstances like these.

01:48:17.935 --> 01:48:22.304
I thought that the army
was the last hope of Japan,

01:48:22.506 --> 01:48:25.703
the last stronghold
of the Japanese soul.

01:48:26.076 --> 01:48:29.204
But the Japanese people today

01:48:29.413 --> 01:48:31.847
think only of money.

01:48:32.049 --> 01:48:33.607
Where is our national spirit?

01:48:35.719 --> 01:48:37.346
We thought the army

01:48:37.555 --> 01:48:39.623
was the soul of national honor!

01:48:39.723 --> 01:48:42.351
The nation
has no spiritual foundation.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.725
What will you do when you are
just a big soulless arsenal?

01:48:50.768 --> 01:48:53.601
The politicians
care nothing for Japan.

01:48:55.573 --> 01:48:57.063
They are greedy for power.

01:48:57.274 --> 01:49:00.175
The army must be
the soul of Japan!

01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:10.880
Listen! Listen!

01:49:20.197 --> 01:49:22.358
<i>Never in physical action</i>

01:49:22.566 --> 01:49:25.660
<i>had I discovered
the chilling satisfaction of words.</i>

01:49:28.339 --> 01:49:30.773
<i>Never in words
had I experienced</i>

01:49:30.975 --> 01:49:34.240
<i>the hot darkness of action.</i>

01:49:36.413 --> 01:49:38.881
<i>Somewhere there must be
a higher principle</i>

01:49:38.982 --> 01:49:41.473
<i>which reconciles art and action.</i>

01:49:47.258 --> 01:49:50.659
<i>That principle, it occurred to me,
was death.</i>

01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:53.859
<i>The vast upper atmosphere,
where there is no oxygen,</i>

01:49:54.064 --> 01:49:56.362
<i>is surrounded with death.</i>

01:49:58.002 --> 01:50:02.439
<i>To survive in this atmosphere,
man, like an actor, must wear a mask.</i>

01:50:04.909 --> 01:50:07.036
<i>Flying at 45,000 feet,</i>

01:50:07.244 --> 01:50:14.013
<i>the silver phallus of the fuselage
floated in sunlight.</i>

01:50:16.487 --> 01:50:19.047
<i>My mind was at ease,</i>

01:50:19.256 --> 01:50:21.816
<i>my thought process lively.</i>

01:50:22.026 --> 01:50:25.325
<i>No movement, no sound,</i>

01:50:25.529 --> 01:50:27.121
<i>no memories.</i>

01:50:30.301 --> 01:50:33.202
<i>The closed cockpit</i>

01:50:33.404 --> 01:50:34.564
<i>and outer space</i>

01:50:34.772 --> 01:50:38.674
<i>were like the spirit
and body of the same being.</i>

01:50:39.276 --> 01:50:42.507
<i>Here I saw the outcome</i>

01:50:42.713 --> 01:50:46.410
<i>of my final action.</i>

01:50:46.617 --> 01:50:51.145
<i>In this stillness
was a beauty beyond words.</i>

01:50:51.355 --> 01:50:55.849
<i>No more body or spirit,</i>

01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:58.028
<i>pen or sword,</i>

01:50:58.228 --> 01:50:59.889
<i>male or female.</i>

01:51:02.333 --> 01:51:05.996
<i>Then I saw a giant circle
coiled around the earth,</i>

01:51:06.203 --> 01:51:09.331
<i>a ring that resolved all contradictions,
a ring vaster than death,</i>

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.304
<i>more fragrant than any scent
I have ever known.</i>

01:51:12.509 --> 01:51:16.605
<i>Here was the moment
I had always been seeking.</i>

01:51:33.297 --> 01:51:35.026
Are you men?

01:51:35.232 --> 01:51:36.859
<i>Are you bushi?</i>

01:51:37.201 --> 01:51:38.600
<i>Are you bushi?</i>

01:51:50.514 --> 01:51:52.778
I appeal to you!

01:51:57.921 --> 01:51:58.888
Listen to me!

01:52:02.493 --> 01:52:04.518
Will no one join with me?

01:52:04.728 --> 01:52:06.559
No one?

01:52:24.148 --> 01:52:27.481
I see you will not rise up.
You will do nothing.

01:52:28.419 --> 01:52:32.219
I have lost my dream for you.

01:52:34.725 --> 01:52:39.662
I will now salute the emperor.

01:52:47.838 --> 01:52:50.272
Long live the emperor!

01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:53.507
Long live the emperor!

01:52:54.344 --> 01:52:56.608
Long live the emperor!

01:53:17.367 --> 01:53:19.631
I don't even think
they heard me.

01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:42.949
Mishima-san, stop!

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.360
There's no reason to do it!

01:53:48.232 --> 01:53:50.757
I am bound to do this, General.

01:53:51.168 --> 01:53:54.569
You must not take
responsibility for this.

01:54:28.906 --> 01:54:31.336
Stop! Please stop!

01:56:46.343 --> 01:56:49.574
<i>" The instant the blade tore open his flesh,
the bright disk of the sun</i>

01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:52.248
<i>soared up behind his eyelids
and exploded,</i>

01:56:52.449 --> 01:56:55.481
<i>lighting the sky for an instant. "</i>
