00:01.584 --> 00:03.586
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.654 --> 00:31.114
PETER: I'm gonna ask you this one time.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.241
Where is Gamora?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.160
I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.872
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

00:40.165 --> 00:43.918
DEY: Gamora. Surgically modified
and trained as a living weapon.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.671
(ALL GRUNTING)

00:46.880 --> 00:48.423
-I'll need this.
-Good luck.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.966
It's internally wired.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.801
I'll figure something out. (GRUNTS)

00:52.385 --> 00:54.888
DEY: The adopted daughter
of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

00:54.971 --> 00:55.972
What's your name?

00:56.264 --> 00:57.265
Gamora.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.933
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.360
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

01:09.611 --> 01:13.031
And, in doing so, made you
the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.326
(YELLING)

01:18.244 --> 01:20.246
Father's plan is finally in motion.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.790
He's found an Infinity Stone.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.667
RONAN: Go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.962
Only then will Thanos
destroy Xandar for me.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.298
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.842
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.636
-(GRUNTS)
-(GROANS)

01:36.721 --> 01:38.431
-(GRUNTS)
-NOVA PILOT: You are under arrest.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.142
SAAL: Looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.852
PRISONER: You first, Gamora!

01:43.228 --> 01:46.439
ROCKET: Lot of prisoners here have lost
their families to Ronan and his goons.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.733
Ronan murdered my family.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.985
I shall kill one of his in return.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.113
-(GRUNTING)
-(BONES CRACKING)

01:53.655 --> 01:56.991
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.786
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.205
I was betraying him.

02:03.581 --> 02:07.001
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.670
(BOTH SCREAMING)

02:09.754 --> 02:11.131
He turned me into a weapon.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.716
Here. You try.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.719
There. You've got it.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.141
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

02:22.308 --> 02:23.726
I couldn't stand by.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.528
(GRUNTS)

02:33.778 --> 02:35.572
Quill? What happened?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.157
PETER: I saw you out there.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.617
I don't know what came over me.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.077
But I couldn't let you die.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.080
You'll die in seconds!

02:47.417 --> 02:49.335
I found something inside of myself.

02:50.753 --> 02:54.007
Something incredibly heroic.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.843
I mean, not to brag.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.846
NEBULA: As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

02:59.929 --> 03:01.181
battle one another in training.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.977
Every time my sister prevailed,

03:06.978 --> 03:09.522
my father would replace
a piece of me with machinery.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.649
(YELLING)

03:13.776 --> 03:15.069
I just wanted a sister!

03:17.071 --> 03:20.617
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.369
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.455
You will always be my sister.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.880
When are we going to do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

03:38.092 --> 03:41.137
GAMORA: One way or another,
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.975
If he gets all six Infinity Stones,
he'll be too powerful to stop.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.060
He already is.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.605
(GROANING)

03:52.273 --> 03:54.859
THANOS: Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

03:55.443 --> 03:57.612
Reality is often disappointing.

03:59.155 --> 04:03.117
Now, reality can be whatever I want.

04:03.368 --> 04:08.498
-(SCREAMING)
-Where is the Soul Stone?

04:09.290 --> 04:10.291
Vormir!

04:12.627 --> 04:13.711
Show me.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.385
RED SKULL: In order to take the stone,
you must lose that which you love.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.096
A soul for a soul.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.142
No. This isn't love.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.447
No!

04:53.751 --> 04:56.087
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

04:56.504 --> 04:59.090
We could enter the quantum realm
at a certain point in time

04:59.382 --> 05:01.342
but then exit at another point in time.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.136
Before Thanos.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.848
We're not the only ones in 2014
looking for the stones.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.225
Wait a minute.
Who else is looking for these stones?

05:12.437 --> 05:13.521
NEBULA: My sister.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.814
GAMORA: Tell me something.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.107
In the future...

05:16.190 --> 05:17.608
what happens to you and me?

05:17.734 --> 05:18.735
We become friends.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.528
We become sisters.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.073
Come on. We can stop him.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.127
Gamora? I thought I lost you.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.506
-Ow. (GROANING)
-Don't touch me!

05:43.134 --> 05:44.302
You missed the first time.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.971
Then you got 'em both the second time.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.515
This is the one? Seriously?

05:49.974 --> 05:51.976
Your choices were him or a tree.
