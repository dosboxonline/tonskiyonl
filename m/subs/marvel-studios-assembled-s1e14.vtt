13:06.368 --> 13:09.079
but it's different
and unique to them at the same time.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.178
This better not be a part of your ritual.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.262
It isn't.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.141
I remember talking about Namor

13:29.225 --> 13:32.561
being in <i>Black Panther 2</i>
while writing the first movie.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.444
<i>He's always been at the top of mind.</i>

13:41.237 --> 13:44.073
<i>In the comics,</i>
<i>the two worlds have a great rivalry.</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:48.536
Namor and Atlantis are

13:48.619 --> 13:51.705
<i>some of the oldest characters</i>
<i>in Marvel publishing.</i>

13:52.081 --> 13:54.458
<i>Namor was one</i>
<i>of the first superheroes, frankly.</i>

13:56.502 --> 13:59.255
But, for us
to introduce Namor into the MCU,

13:59.338 --> 14:02.424
<i>there needed to be something</i>
<i>that grounded it in a reality</i>

14:02.508 --> 14:06.929
<i>that felt like, as tactile as hopefully,</i>
<i>the world of Wakanda feels.</i>

14:07.221 --> 14:10.933
<i>And in talking with Ryan, figuring out</i>
<i>how to bring this character to life,</i>

14:11.016 --> 14:12.893
<i>one thing we thought</i>
<i>was really interesting</i>

14:12.977 --> 14:15.646
was viewing Namor through the lens
of Mesoamerican culture.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.111
In preparation, we knew the film would be

14:22.194 --> 14:24.822
about Wakandans
coming in contact with another place.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.326
Mesoamerica was something
I was thinking about a bit.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.829
<i>And upon research,</i>

14:32.621 --> 14:35.499
<i>it became more clear</i>
<i>that the people of the Yucatán</i>

14:35.833 --> 14:37.126
<i>made a ton of sense.</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:44.842
<i>We would see images of them</i>
<i>drawing themselves with blue paint on,</i>

14:44.925 --> 14:48.512
<i>that was the color that we wanted</i>
<i>from Marvel comics that inspired the film</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:51.432
<i>and the more we got into it,</i>
<i>we realized it was meant to be.</i>

14:52.182 --> 14:56.020
JOEL HARLOW: This is our background area
for doing the Talokanil.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.273
These are the gills.
They were grown digitally

14:59.356 --> 15:03.027
in the computer, sculpted,
then grown, we grew the mold.

15:03.110 --> 15:07.573
And then mass produced that mold
so we could knock out a lot of 'em.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.994
These also have to go in water,
so they've to be very durable.

15:12.077 --> 15:16.081
<i>Now he's gonna go over to get painted.</i>
<i>His whole body will be painted blue.</i>

15:17.041 --> 15:20.252
<i>And then he'll come back to me</i>
<i>and I'll finish him up.</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:23.339
<i>He also goes to hair, and costumes.</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:28.886
Each warrior has their own fish or mammal

15:28.969 --> 15:32.306
that's signature to their look.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.893
<i>Attuma has the hammerhead shark.</i>

15:36.018 --> 15:39.063
<i>The other warriors,</i>
<i>some of their costumes use</i>

15:39.146 --> 15:45.152
<i>what appear to be shells and stones</i>
<i>and whale skin, fish skin.</i>

15:45.569 --> 15:50.074
They have
their traditional Maya earspools.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.495
<i>The costume really does feel like</i>

15:54.578 --> 15:57.873
<i>this is something</i>
<i>that has been tooled over time.</i>

15:58.540 --> 16:02.211
The way we went about making
the first movie was with as much respect

16:02.378 --> 16:05.381
for the cultures we were pulling from
and for the audience.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.135
<i>So we wanted to do the same thing</i>

16:10.219 --> 16:12.388
<i>for the cultures</i>
<i>we were reflecting in this.</i>

16:13.222 --> 16:16.100
<i>Black Panther 1</i> for us was a big impact.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.520
<i>Everybody can identify with that story.</i>

16:19.603 --> 16:23.983
We suffer because of the racism,
and social cancers.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.442
Black Panther, <i>it was like,</i>

16:25.526 --> 16:28.153
<i>"Oh, my God, there is nothing</i>
<i>wrong in us."</i>

16:28.654 --> 16:31.573
There is nothing bad,
you know, we are not broken.

16:31.657 --> 16:36.078
So, it was, important
and now it's our turn.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.541
COLE: <i>The Mayans are...</i>

16:40.624 --> 16:43.419
There's so much mystery
around their civilization.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.087
COOGLER: Action.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.007
COLE: <i>There's so much</i>
<i>fertile terrain there to explore,</i>

16:48.090 --> 16:51.260
<i>their artwork</i>
<i>and their advanced agriculture.</i>

16:51.385 --> 16:53.595
<i>All of these things</i>
<i>that they accomplished,</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:58.058
it just was a perfect palette
for us to kind of, delve into.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.857
COOGLER: <i>With Namor, we knew early on,</i>

17:04.940 --> 17:07.276
I was like,
"We gotta find out how he got this name."

17:07.359 --> 17:11.447
'Cause in the comics,
the explanation for his name was simple.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.199
<i>His story goes,</i>
<i>they took "Roman" and spelt it backwards.</i>

17:14.283 --> 17:16.493
<i>That's not gonna work</i>
<i>with what we're doing here.</i>

17:17.286 --> 17:20.289
<i>I had the thought,</i>
<i>somebody said something to him in Spanish</i>

17:20.372 --> 17:21.999
<i>and kind of curses him in a way.</i>

17:22.082 --> 17:23.083
That's how he got his name.

17:25.836 --> 17:29.131
MAN: On my mark in three, two, one.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.133
COOGLER: <i>When our collaborators</i>
<i>came up with the idea</i>

17:31.216 --> 17:32.968
<i>of</i> sin amor <i>which means no love.</i>

17:33.260 --> 17:34.344
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:37.681 --> 17:40.768
<i>His enemies were calling him that.</i>
<i>That's how we came up with it.</i>

17:40.851 --> 17:42.561
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:42.644 --> 17:43.687
(MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:45.314 --> 17:46.815
The child without love.

17:48.358 --> 17:52.321
Namor's costumes
reflect the tradition that he honors

17:52.404 --> 17:54.698
<i>and a lot of researching went into that.</i>

17:55.115 --> 18:00.162
<i>His shoulder mantle</i>
<i>and headpiece that he wears on the throne</i>

18:00.245 --> 18:04.374
<i>is curated from</i>
<i>post-Yucatec Mayan culture.</i>

18:04.458 --> 18:07.795
<i>It's the snake and we used a lot of kelp</i>

18:07.878 --> 18:12.758
<i>and things to make the whole headdress</i>
<i>and handwove his cape.</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:17.471
<i>but we kept it pure</i>
<i>to what he looked like in the comics.</i>

18:22.476 --> 18:25.229
The elements for me,

18:25.312 --> 18:28.440
sort of the makeup effects
elements, are his ears,

18:28.524 --> 18:31.360
<i>I did a couple of iterations of those,</i>

18:31.860 --> 18:34.696
<i>and then we did a septum piercing on him.</i>

18:34.780 --> 18:37.741
He's got earrings
that the costume department provided,

18:37.825 --> 18:42.496
<i>but finding his look</i>
<i>on our actor was pretty easy actually.</i>

18:42.579 --> 18:46.583
<i>He embodies so much</i>
<i>of what I had read Namor to be,</i>

18:47.167 --> 18:50.921
<i>that you don't want to cover him up</i>
<i>with fake eyebrows and stuff like that,</i>

18:51.004 --> 18:54.633
<i>I mean, he's got enough eyebrow there</i>
<i>that I can give him a slight point,</i>

18:54.716 --> 18:58.804
<i>but he's got</i>
<i>great ears for ear prosthetics,</i>

18:58.887 --> 19:00.848
which was, you know, that was a gift.

19:00.931 --> 19:01.932
That was a bonus.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.027
The fish man.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.698
DUKE: <i>What's great about Tenoch is that...</i>

19:17.781 --> 19:20.951
like any great actor,
in my opinion, he loves to play.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.747
He enters the scene with an open mind

19:25.831 --> 19:28.041
and ready to play and try things.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.126
COOGLER: Action.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.715
He carries a lot of gravitas
which the character has,

19:34.798 --> 19:38.844
<i>but he has a lot</i>
<i>of softness and potential warmth</i>

19:38.927 --> 19:41.722
<i>which creates a really great dynamic.</i>

19:41.805 --> 19:46.143
For me, to be part of this world,
with all the respect, it's a dream.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.312
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:49.229 --> 19:51.148
-Cut.
-Clean. Good job.

19:51.231 --> 19:55.569
HUERTA: <i>I never imagined</i>
<i>to be here playing this character.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:03.493
<i>And I have the best allies</i>
<i>around me including Mabel.</i>

20:03.577 --> 20:05.245
MABEL CADENA: <i>It was amazing experience,</i>

20:05.329 --> 20:06.955
<i>I have to learn Maya for the movie</i>

20:07.039 --> 20:10.209
because Namora
only speak Maya in the movie.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.128
(SPEAKING MAYA)

20:13.378 --> 20:16.673
That was interesting challenge.
It's really hard.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.969
(SPEAKING MAYA)

20:26.808 --> 20:28.227
(GRUNTS)

20:28.310 --> 20:31.772
CADENA: <i>It's really difficult</i>
<i>but because we have a lot of time,</i>

20:31.855 --> 20:34.149
<i>a lot of months with our coach</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:38.278
for pronunciation
and for memorize the line.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.365
<i>But the big goal was on set</i>

20:41.448 --> 20:44.910
<i>because sometimes Ryan,</i>
<i>he needed change the lines,</i>

20:44.993 --> 20:46.995
<i>and that was a big challenge</i>

20:47.079 --> 20:51.458
<i>because you need</i>
<i>learn at the moment a new line.</i>

20:52.084 --> 20:54.920
<i>It's a really, really achievement for us</i>

20:55.837 --> 20:59.299
in that moment, learn a new word in Maya.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.343
<i>Líik'ik Talokan!</i>

21:01.468 --> 21:02.928
<i>Líik'ik Talokan!</i>

21:03.470 --> 21:04.846
BEACHLER: <i>When you look at Talokan,</i>

21:04.930 --> 21:09.142
<i>we kind of took inspiration</i>
<i>from the temples that you see,</i>

21:09.226 --> 21:10.602
<i>we worked with an archaeologist</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:13.522
<i>and he's written books in Mayan</i>
<i>and he really helped us along</i>

21:13.605 --> 21:16.900
<i>with how to get to where</i>
<i>we needed to be as far as their history.</i>

21:16.984 --> 21:20.153
<i>But also, being reminded that...</i>

21:20.237 --> 21:23.240
Namor never actually
lived during those times, right?

21:23.323 --> 21:25.784
He never lived in Maya
during its glory years

21:25.867 --> 21:27.953
'cause he wasn't born
until they went into the water.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.706
<i>So everything that's there,</i>
<i>is based on memory.</i>

21:30.789 --> 21:33.250
So that's why
things are just a little askewed

21:33.333 --> 21:35.502
because he's remembering
what he's been told

21:35.585 --> 21:39.006
<i>and then what he saw</i>
<i>before everything went into ruins.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:42.134
This is what's underneath El Castillo.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.719
-Right.
-Which is K'uk'ulkan.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.345
COOGLER: How did y'all model the...

21:45.429 --> 21:46.930
-Stalactites is up, right?
-Up.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.598
-Mites is down.
-Mites is down.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.059
There's over 700 on both sets.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.687
-Jesus.
-Yeah, they hand carved each one

21:53.770 --> 21:56.356
in about three weeks.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.568
-COOGLER: Amazing.
-And then, this is our...

22:01.945 --> 22:04.698
sister cenote to the visitors quarters.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.242
Those are hand carved.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.953
-COOGLER: The big...
-It took like six weeks

22:10.037 --> 22:12.247
to hand carve those ten-foot steles.

22:12.331 --> 22:16.335
And the faces are like,
kind of, after Tenoch's face.

22:16.793 --> 22:17.878
-COOGLER: Yeah, wow.
-Yeah.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.463
Mmm-hmm.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.382
And then, this.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.177
Everything's from Tulum.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.471
COOGLER: Yeah, this one...

22:28.221 --> 22:29.556
This one's my favorite one.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.016
That's my favorite one,

22:31.099 --> 22:32.934
-the panther and Namor.
-Yeah.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.312
In the style of Bonampak.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.482
And the people are really brown.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.484
Which is awesome.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.944
COOGLER: It's pretty incredible, man.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.364
-So much detail in all this stuff.
-BEACHLER: Yeah.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.700
All this is crazy.
How do they plant all this stuff?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.285
They plant this in real dirt?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.828
Yes, so this whole...

22:51.912 --> 22:53.538
-It's all living plants?
-Yes.

22:53.955 --> 22:57.501
And this whole stage is built on dirt.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.420
<i>We cover the ground covering</i>
<i>and then bring in the rocks.</i>

23:00.504 --> 23:03.590
<i>You know, this is deeper</i>
<i>than any of the other tanks,</i>

23:04.007 --> 23:05.133
<i>so they can dive.</i>

23:09.388 --> 23:15.102
WOMAN: <i>Take it away,</i>
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

23:15.185 --> 23:16.353
MAN: <i>Actors go underwater.</i>

23:17.521 --> 23:20.232
COOGLER: <i>I want to go</i>
<i>where the story requires us to go.</i>

23:21.983 --> 23:25.570
There was this quote about how little
we know about the depths of the ocean.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.075
<i>And how, the deeper you get down there,</i>
<i>the more alien things look and seem.</i>

23:33.495 --> 23:35.872
And so for us,
we were talking a lot about this film

23:35.956 --> 23:38.417
being like,
a first contact movie, in a way.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.228
<i>We were talking</i>
<i>about Namor as kinda being...</i>

23:58.311 --> 24:01.648
a little bit of a spaceman,
in a deep ocean as outer space.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.985
MAN: <i>All set, three, two, one, action.</i>

24:05.068 --> 24:08.113
COOGLER: <i>At that point, the movie</i>
<i>took on this specific identity</i>

24:08.196 --> 24:10.574
<i>of having these</i>
<i>water scenes that are super tactile.</i>

24:10.657 --> 24:13.577
MAN: <i>Three, two, one. Turn.</i>

24:13.660 --> 24:16.955
COOGLER: <i>And I knew we needed</i>
<i>to do it for real, as much as we could.</i>

24:22.919 --> 24:23.920
<i>Hello.</i>

24:24.004 --> 24:27.841
MAN: <i>Cut. And surface.</i>

24:29.259 --> 24:32.679
COOGLER: <i>And it made more sense when</i>
<i>things happened that slid our schedule.</i>

24:32.762 --> 24:35.515
We noticed, we're not gonna
have a ton of time for...

24:35.599 --> 24:37.726
to VFX every single water shot,

24:37.809 --> 24:40.312
so it would be great
to get in there and do it.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.986
For me, I love
doing everything I can in camera.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.365
<i>And it's really all about lighting.</i>

24:53.158 --> 24:56.369
We had to take into consideration
a lot of things because...

24:57.245 --> 24:59.039
<i>you know, this city</i>

24:59.122 --> 25:02.292
<i>is so deep under water</i>
<i>that there shouldn't be any light.</i>

25:04.044 --> 25:06.505
A lot of what
we're used to seeing, underwater worlds,

25:06.588 --> 25:10.342
people breathing under water,
sometimes these examples can be

25:11.009 --> 25:14.054
<i>over-lit, that look a little fake, right?</i>

25:14.137 --> 25:15.472
<i>Like they're not underwater.</i>

25:15.847 --> 25:17.474
<i>So we had in our tank</i>

25:17.557 --> 25:20.936
<i>very soft light above pushing through.</i>

25:21.019 --> 25:22.979
MAN: <i>All right. Camera, set.</i>

25:23.063 --> 25:26.691
ARKAPAW: <i>So that's the believability</i>
<i>factor if you're underwater.</i>

25:26.775 --> 25:29.486
<i>It's like we have this soft,</i>
<i>ambient light that feels real,</i>

25:29.569 --> 25:31.571
<i>not very punchy, not reflective.</i>

25:32.989 --> 25:33.990
MAN: <i>Go.</i>

25:34.866 --> 25:37.869
Everything is against you under water.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.831
<i>Safety's against you, time's against you,</i>
<i>communication's against you.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:44.042
Moviemaking is hard on dry land,

25:45.502 --> 25:46.753
<i>and you get under water,</i>

25:46.836 --> 25:50.840
<i>the difficulty factor</i>
<i>gets amplified by a factor of a 100.</i>

25:50.924 --> 25:52.551
WOMAN: <i>Great, and charts.</i>

25:58.515 --> 26:00.016
DENISON: <i>One issue we encountered was</i>

26:00.100 --> 26:02.435
<i>a lot of the cast</i>
<i>wasn't comfortable swimming.</i>

26:02.519 --> 26:04.980
MAN 1: <i>Five seconds, roll camera.</i>

26:05.063 --> 26:06.106
MAN 2: <i>Rolling.</i>

26:06.940 --> 26:08.358
WRIGHT: <i>I struggled with it.</i>

26:08.441 --> 26:12.153
<i>Ryan called me and he was like,</i>
<i>"Tish, can you swim?"</i>

26:12.237 --> 26:13.238
I was like...

26:13.947 --> 26:16.992
"Sir, sir, I'm in the lab.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.579
"What more do you need
from me coming out of that lab?"

26:20.662 --> 26:22.914
<i>So I had to learn to swim very quickly,</i>

26:22.998 --> 26:25.458
<i>and everybody</i>
<i>was in a corner learning to swim.</i>

26:26.751 --> 26:28.378
Now I've swam...

26:29.212 --> 26:32.048
in a mediocre manner since I was little.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.137
<i>I used to swim like a puppy,</i>
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

26:37.220 --> 26:39.472
<i>Not anything that anyone wants to film.</i>

26:40.348 --> 26:42.475
<i>I had to become friends with the water.</i>

26:44.019 --> 26:47.063
<i>You have to be so present</i>
<i>when you're dealing with water.</i>

26:47.772 --> 26:48.898
WOMAN: <i>Thirty seconds.</i>

26:49.316 --> 26:50.400
DENISON: Five purges.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.612
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

26:58.283 --> 26:59.784
NYONG'O: <i>You cannot afford stage fright.</i>

26:59.868 --> 27:02.912
WOMAN: <i>Three, two, one.</i>

27:03.246 --> 27:04.414
MAN: <i>Actors going down.</i>

27:08.710 --> 27:10.754
NYONG'O: <i>You can't afford</i>
<i>adrenaline, really.</i>

27:12.172 --> 27:14.007
NYONG'O: <i>You can't afford to hurry.</i>

27:14.090 --> 27:17.594
You actually have to slow
all the way down and focus.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.223
<i>And it was such a great lesson</i>
<i>for performance in general.</i>

27:24.601 --> 27:25.894
COOGLER: The look back's great.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.729
Right. I said... I told...

27:27.812 --> 27:31.107
-How they're coming after...
-COOGLER: Yeah, yeah, totally.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.400
Looks good.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.737
DENISON: <i>Throughout the film, we don't</i>
<i>really see anybody on actual scuba.</i>

27:35.820 --> 27:37.197
<i>Majority of it is free-diving.</i>

27:37.280 --> 27:39.491
<i>You look at Tenoch's character,</i>
<i>Mabel's character,</i>

27:39.574 --> 27:42.577
<i>they have to look, not only competent,</i>
<i>but very comfortable.</i>

27:44.245 --> 27:45.955
<i>Like they were born under water.</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:47.957
We've to get them to a point

27:48.041 --> 27:50.085
where they're comfortable
holding their breath,

27:50.168 --> 27:52.128
<i>they're not thinking</i>
<i>about holding their breath,</i>

27:52.212 --> 27:53.296
<i>but thinking about acting.</i>

27:54.255 --> 27:55.423
<i>And being in the scene.</i>

27:56.299 --> 28:00.679
The free-diving
is so fantastic and peaceful,

28:00.762 --> 28:04.140
when you are down in the tank,
everything is silent

28:04.224 --> 28:10.438
<i>and it's like, active meditation in a way,</i>
<i>and I can hold my breath for five minutes.</i>

28:10.522 --> 28:11.606
<i>That's my record.</i>

28:14.275 --> 28:16.486
(SPEAKING SPANISH, CHUCKLES)

28:18.530 --> 28:21.533
DENISON: <i>Mabel is the single best</i>
<i>free dive student I've ever had</i>

28:21.616 --> 28:23.702
<i>and I've taught lots how to breath-hold.</i>

28:23.785 --> 28:27.622
We could push her to 10-minute range
if we had another week with her.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.042
<i>What's interesting</i>
<i>about Namor and the Talokanil</i>

28:31.126 --> 28:34.045
is they're actually
kind of, super soldiers in water

28:34.129 --> 28:36.131
so they're going
to want to move through water

28:36.214 --> 28:38.341
in a way that
the human body probably can't.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.387
<i>There needs to be an interesting marriage</i>

28:42.470 --> 28:44.597
<i>with the stuff</i>
<i>we shoot underwater, wet for wet.</i>

28:44.681 --> 28:45.682
MAN: <i>Cut.</i>

28:45.765 --> 28:48.143
<i>And some stuff</i>
<i>we shoot out of water, dry for wet.</i>

28:48.685 --> 28:52.897
<i>Because they're stronger and faster</i>
<i>swimmers than any human on the planet.</i>

28:55.275 --> 28:58.194
So there was a lot of figuring out to do

28:58.278 --> 29:01.197
<i>between the different ways</i>
<i>that Wakandans move through water</i>

29:01.906 --> 29:03.491
<i>versus the Talokanil.</i>

29:03.575 --> 29:07.203
<i>There's a lot of kind of,</i>
<i>math and geometry being done constantly</i>

29:07.287 --> 29:11.416
<i>to make sure that those two different</i>
<i>groups of people are moving differently.</i>

29:11.833 --> 29:14.335
<i>But there's an internal logic</i>
<i>to how everybody moves.</i>

29:14.419 --> 29:16.004
ARKAPAW: <i>When we did</i>
<i>our dry for wet,</i>

29:16.087 --> 29:19.799
<i>we were always trying to keep true</i>
<i>to how light works in the tank.</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:23.428
Since a lot of wet for wet stuff
was shot first, we had a reference.

29:24.512 --> 29:28.933
So, trying to make it look more real
is kind of making sure that

29:29.434 --> 29:32.061
<i>the rules, the scientific rules of light,</i>

29:32.145 --> 29:34.856
<i>stay true to when</i>
<i>you're shooting it underwater.</i>

29:34.939 --> 29:37.025
You want these to maybe push a little bit?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.526
COOGLER: Yes, I do.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.153
-Kind of step out...
-Okay, man.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.948
One of the most difficult elements
of this film was the exosuits.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.160
<i>It's a submarine that you wear,</i>
<i>with the arms and legs.</i>

29:47.243 --> 29:49.579
<i>They make 'em</i>
<i>for utility work under water.</i>

29:49.662 --> 29:51.998
<i>Each suit is about</i>
<i>a million and a half dollars.</i>

29:52.707 --> 29:54.834
<i>People don't realize that was wet for wet.</i>

29:55.376 --> 29:57.003
<i>Those were the actual suits.</i>

29:57.337 --> 30:02.133
And using the exosuits in the tank
was an incredible opportunity to learn.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.552
<i>But it was a massive challenge.</i>

30:04.636 --> 30:07.889
MAN: <i>If we can try to see past it</i>
<i>through the vibranium detector.</i>

30:09.349 --> 30:12.435
DENISON: <i>We had to all kind of,</i>
<i>become experts in them overnight.</i>

30:12.769 --> 30:15.021
Worst thing that
could happen is the suit breaks,

30:15.104 --> 30:18.608
they go, "No, the scariest thing
is a fire inside of the suit."

30:18.691 --> 30:20.068
It's pretty frightening.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.694
We don't want that.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.572
<i>So we had to develop,</i>
<i>just like we do for all stunts,</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:26.741
<i>a safety plan for how the suits work.</i>

30:28.576 --> 30:30.787
<i>But it was pretty phenomenal,</i>
<i>the end result.</i>

30:31.287 --> 30:33.081
This is practical moviemaking
at its finest,

30:33.164 --> 30:36.334
which, in the age of VFX,
is a very cool thing to see, right?

30:37.919 --> 30:39.087
MAN: <i>Alex, you ready?</i>

30:39.587 --> 30:41.047
<i>All right, here we go. Ready?</i>

30:41.422 --> 30:43.132
<i>And, action.</i>

30:49.681 --> 30:51.182
<i>-You okay?</i>
-I moved my head.

30:52.141 --> 30:55.395
I was intimidated. I'm not gonna lie.

30:57.230 --> 31:01.484
<i>You know, I've seen Danai</i>
<i>on TV for years, you know.</i>

31:01.943 --> 31:02.986
The Walking Dead.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.905
<i>So, meeting her, it was like...</i>

31:06.948 --> 31:09.951
"Hi, how you doing, I'm Alex." (CHUCKLES)

31:11.035 --> 31:13.204
<i>But she's been great, you know.</i>

31:13.788 --> 31:15.915
<i>She's the one that I worked with the most.</i>

31:16.207 --> 31:19.961
<i>And she's been the most amazing person</i>

31:20.044 --> 31:21.379
<i>in the sense of...</i>

31:21.462 --> 31:23.673
<i>This is my first time in the MCU</i>

31:23.756 --> 31:26.467
<i>or doing something this big</i>
<i>and that fight on the bridge...</i>

31:26.551 --> 31:29.053

31:29.137 --> 31:30.263
<i>You get goosebumps.</i>

31:31.639 --> 31:34.475
<i>When I first started</i>
<i>and I actually saw the video</i>

31:34.559 --> 31:36.686
the stunt guys made for our fight,

31:36.769 --> 31:38.021
I was intimidated.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.650
<i>I was like, "Man, I look so good."</i>

31:42.734 --> 31:44.235
Why should I mess it up? (CHUCKLES)

31:47.071 --> 31:51.784
So it was a lot of training
for a long time, for a lot of weeks.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.373
When I started,
it was like I had two left feet.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.585
<i>I couldn't move</i>
<i>as well as they did, but through time,</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:02.795
I... I got it.

32:02.879 --> 32:06.507
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I started dancing, as they call it.</i>

32:08.217 --> 32:10.011
(GRUNTING)

32:10.094 --> 32:12.472
(EXCLAIMS AND BREATHES HEAVILY)

32:17.226 --> 32:19.854
Something that was very important

32:19.938 --> 32:24.025
was to highlight what Danai
could actually do as Okoye.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.905
Because I think it's important
to capture her on screen, you know?

32:28.988 --> 32:31.991
We could always go to a double,
it's not... That's easy, right?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.202
But Danai put in a lot of work.

32:35.036 --> 32:39.499
<i>And I think actors are different</i>
<i>than your average stunt performer</i>

32:39.582 --> 32:42.335
because a stunt performer
will try to definitely...

32:42.669 --> 32:46.047
Not all of them,
but they will try to do everything

32:46.422 --> 32:48.216
physically with more grit,

32:48.299 --> 32:50.635
but an actor thinks
about the emotion behind it.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.428
COOGLER: Cut. cut.
MAN: Cut it, cut it.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.055
Let's do one more, I'm sorry.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.348
MAN: Reset.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.725
Don't you think like she should get
right next to camera

32:57.809 --> 32:59.394
-So I can come in faster?
-COOGLER: Yeah.

33:01.604 --> 33:04.399
TONEY: <i>There's more weight,</i>
<i>and so when that translates,</i>

33:05.024 --> 33:06.859
you get something very special.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.284
GURIRA: <i>In Okoye's mind,</i>
<i>there's no one who's gonna top her</i>

33:15.785 --> 33:17.078
<i>in regards to combat.</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:20.498
<i>Doesn't matter what their size is,</i>

33:20.581 --> 33:23.543
it doesn't matter
what their musculature is.

<i>by y'all who just came off</i>
<i>of a killer whale's back.</i>

33:28.965 --> 33:31.134
Cute, but let me just get to work.

33:32.301 --> 33:34.220
So that's how she thinks, you know.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.473
Take another step closer...

33:39.017 --> 33:40.518

(GRUNTS)

33:43.271 --> 33:44.480

I really wanted
to make Attuma just bigger

33:47.275 --> 33:52.155
than everybody else physically,
to create that intimidating size.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.242
So, yeah, a lot of working out
and a lot of eating,

33:56.325 --> 33:59.871
I was eating like, every ten seconds.

33:59.954 --> 34:03.416
You know, I was consuming
about 6,000 calories a day

34:03.499 --> 34:04.667
<i>and I gained 30 pounds.</i>

34:06.377 --> 34:09.881

look intimidating, but be swift.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.718
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:13.801 --> 34:15.261
Danai is gonna be different.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.514
(BOTH GRUNTING)

34:19.724 --> 34:23.811
She has to be extremely tactical
about how she attacks,

34:24.103 --> 34:26.856
because this guy is extremely powerful.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.858
So you're gonna see her calculating.

34:28.941 --> 34:31.694

<i>rarely on the ropes,</i>

<i>a little vulnerability here.</i>

34:38.201 --> 34:39.243
(GRUNTS)

34:39.327 --> 34:41.454
She's never faced anyone like this before.

(GRUNTS)

34:44.290 --> 34:46.209
(GRUNTS)

34:48.419 --> 34:52.340
With Okoye, what I was deeply attracted to

34:52.423 --> 34:58.262
was, from the jump, Ryan was very clear
about how he wanted her to be.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.642
And then, kinda going like this.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.312
GURIRA: <i>And the way,</i>
<i>the idea of her being a general</i>

35:06.395 --> 35:08.397
<i>the idea of the Dora Milaje</i>

35:08.481 --> 35:11.692
and then,
the traditionalism of who she was

35:11.776 --> 35:16.072
was definitely something that
really helped me anchor her.

35:16.614 --> 35:21.828
<i>'Cause her connection to her country</i>
<i>was so, so passionate.</i>

35:21.911 --> 35:24.747
<i>This is a woman</i>
<i>who actually really enjoys her life.</i>

35:24.831 --> 35:28.501
<i>And she loves</i>
<i>being a Wakandan more than anything.</i>

35:28.584 --> 35:32.046
<i>But you know, when you're being told</i>
<i>you can't be a soldier anymore,</i>

35:32.130 --> 35:34.549
<i>and that's all you've been</i>
<i>that's all you know,</i>

35:34.632 --> 35:38.636
<i>that's definitely... a dark corridor.</i>

35:39.679 --> 35:41.556
<i>But that's the arc she has to take.</i>

35:42.431 --> 35:45.226
She never thought she'd
do anything but die for Wakanda,

35:45.309 --> 35:48.020
you know, in that uniform.

35:48.729 --> 35:52.191
But when that's taken off,
now who are you?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.819
<i>And that's what she has to find</i>

35:54.902 --> 35:58.781
<i>and that's what she... ultimately finds</i>
<i>with the Midnight Angels.</i>

36:00.408 --> 36:03.494
I'm excited about
the cultures celebrated in this film,

36:03.578 --> 36:07.748
<i>I'm excited about the new characters</i>
<i>that will be introduced to the world.</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:11.627
<i>Especially to see</i>
<i>how Dominique's portrayal of Riri</i>

36:11.711 --> 36:13.546
<i>come alive, it's so beautiful because...</i>

36:14.338 --> 36:15.798
<i>Riri is now in Africa</i>

36:15.882 --> 36:19.093
<i>and Riri is now</i>
<i>a reflection of T'Challa's decision.</i>

36:19.177 --> 36:21.929
She is a result
of T'Challa's decision in saying

36:22.013 --> 36:25.516
<i>we're gonna open our borders,</i>
<i>we're gonna help.</i>

36:26.184 --> 36:27.810
<i>We must find a way...</i>

36:28.519 --> 36:30.354
<i>to look after one another...</i>

36:31.022 --> 36:35.151
<i>as if we were one, single tribe.</i>

36:35.234 --> 36:36.986
When we were making the first film,

36:37.069 --> 36:39.280
<i>one of the things</i>
<i>that we kept talking about</i>

36:39.363 --> 36:42.200
<i>is that, yes,</i>
<i>Wakandan is extremely African, right?</i>

36:42.700 --> 36:45.036
<i>But, in terms of their mentality,</i>

36:45.119 --> 36:47.914
<i>because they are,</i>
<i>quote-unquote on top of the world,</i>

36:47.997 --> 36:49.916
<i>they are only concerned with themselves.</i>

36:49.999 --> 36:52.251
And in a sense,
that's a reflection of America.

36:52.335 --> 36:57.548
I believe I speak for
all the member states here...

36:59.133 --> 37:04.013
when I say that I am deeply
disappointed in Wakanda's failure.

37:04.513 --> 37:08.935
So, in our narrative, Wakanda is that.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.063
<i>And what Riri does for us</i>

37:12.146 --> 37:16.150
<i>is open up Wakanda</i>
<i>for us to be able to relate</i>

37:16.234 --> 37:21.155
<i>and for other people</i>
<i>to be able to see other perspectives.</i>

37:21.239 --> 37:23.407
Riri, I love all that she represents

37:23.491 --> 37:26.369
<i>and Dominique herself</i>
<i>is extremely impressive.</i>

37:26.452 --> 37:27.912
<i>She's the daughter of immigrants,</i>

37:27.995 --> 37:30.248
<i>first child to go to college</i>
<i>in her whole family,</i>

37:30.331 --> 37:33.918
<i>she just graduated</i>
<i>from Cornell herself in the sciences,</i>

37:34.001 --> 37:36.545
<i>and she's playing this role,</i>
<i>I think that's so cool,</i>

37:36.629 --> 37:37.797
<i>like, it gets me teary-eyed.</i>

37:37.880 --> 37:38.965
Hey.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.676
The poetry of it is
that's actually who's playing it.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.969
You forgot to Venmo me.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.554
It slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

37:46.681 --> 37:49.600
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.
It's a band today.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.103
My name is Dominique Thorne.

37:52.186 --> 37:55.481
Dominique auditioned
for Shuri for the first movie.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.693
The particles absorb the kinetic energy

37:58.776 --> 38:01.237
and hold it in place for redistribution.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.864
And we really liked her
and we thought she was smart

38:03.948 --> 38:06.284
<i>and she has a great presence</i>
<i>and she is funny</i>

38:06.367 --> 38:09.245
<i>and she has a lot of attitude</i>
<i>but we remembered that audition.</i>

38:09.328 --> 38:12.540
Old tech. Functional, but old.

38:13.165 --> 38:17.420
Oh! People are shooting at me.
Wait, guys, let me put on my helmet.

38:17.503 --> 38:22.008
And so when we decided to put
Riri Williams into <i>Wakanda Forever,</i>

38:22.091 --> 38:23.759
<i>she was the first and only call.</i>

38:26.053 --> 38:30.099
DUKE: <i>This is her foray</i>
<i>into coming into something</i>

38:30.182 --> 38:34.228
that felt really established
and like, we all had our own relationships

38:34.312 --> 38:39.066
and she came in strong,
holding her own, very prepared,

38:39.150 --> 38:43.446
<i>and just willing to go toe to toe</i>
<i>with everyone and that's her character.</i>

38:45.698 --> 38:46.991
Yo, we got him.

38:47.074 --> 38:51.912
It felt like stepping into a family,
stepping into someone's home.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.457
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.666
WOMAN: Right this way.

38:55.958 --> 38:59.545
<i>And wanting to enter in</i>
<i>with the utmost respect</i>

38:59.628 --> 39:04.842
and reverence for what it is
and what they've done.

39:04.925 --> 39:09.555
<i>But it was also exciting</i>
<i>because sort of, Riri's presence there</i>

39:09.638 --> 39:12.475
<i>along with these new characters</i>
<i>meant that there was more</i>

39:13.267 --> 39:15.728
<i>to be found, more to explore.</i>

39:15.811 --> 39:19.231
It was very, very fun and beautiful

39:19.315 --> 39:24.028
to sort of, go on that ride
with the folks who know the place best.

39:24.904 --> 39:29.992
CARTER: <i>You see that in the story,</i>
<i>Riri builds this machine</i>

39:30.076 --> 39:32.370
that Shuri is very impressed by,

39:32.453 --> 39:35.915
and it flies and it shoots
and it does all kinds of things.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.127
MAN: <i>Three, two, one and blast.</i>

39:43.339 --> 39:45.174
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

39:49.011 --> 39:52.681
CARTER: <i>And it's also</i>
<i>a very difficult costume to craft.</i>

39:52.765 --> 39:55.976
<i>It's actually, you know, put together</i>

39:56.060 --> 40:00.815
<i>through some mold work but also,</i>
<i>you know, there's metal work there</i>

40:00.898 --> 40:05.945
<i>and it's also a costume</i>
<i>of all kinds of mechanical parts.</i>

40:06.529 --> 40:10.991
And you can imagine the plethora of pieces
that would go into a costume like that.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.537
<i>They were all discussed</i>
<i>over many multiple meetings.</i>

40:15.287 --> 40:18.791
<i>What these cannons do,</i>
<i>what her armpieces do,</i>

40:18.874 --> 40:20.626
<i>how she moves about.</i>

40:20.709 --> 40:24.630
<i>There were so many elements</i>
<i>to that costume that had to be sussed out.</i>

40:24.713 --> 40:26.757
It's such a smart build because

40:26.841 --> 40:31.011
<i>as heavy and as bulky as it is,</i>
<i>all of my joints are free</i>

40:31.095 --> 40:34.598
<i>and so I could step, I could walk,</i>
<i>I could wave, I could squat.</i>

40:34.682 --> 40:39.437
<i>I could do all the things,</i>
<i>but just with this extra weight on.</i>

40:39.520 --> 40:42.565
I think it's probably
most comparable to football gear,

40:42.648 --> 40:45.484
(CHUCKLES) <i>is what a lot of folks</i>
<i>were comparing it to.</i>

40:45.568 --> 40:50.072
<i>And I definitely do feel like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, like, I'm ready for anything now,"</i>

40:50.156 --> 40:52.158
you know,
which is a great feeling. (CHUCKLES)

40:52.533 --> 40:55.995
MAN: On my call, in three,
two, one, action.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.623
MAN: Cut it. Cut, cut.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.292
You all right?

41:02.084 --> 41:04.295
But the Mark II is where we get to see

41:04.378 --> 41:09.717
<i>that sort of, Wakandan flair</i>
<i>sort of, rub off on Riri.</i>

41:09.800 --> 41:11.635
<i>It has a much sleeker design.</i>

41:12.970 --> 41:15.681
There were a lot
of discussions about how closely

41:15.764 --> 41:19.059
<i>it would relate to the Iron Man costume.</i>

41:19.685 --> 41:23.355
<i>And Ryan wanted it to be Chicago Bulls red</i>

41:23.439 --> 41:25.858
<i>and we moved the heart to the side,</i>

41:26.275 --> 41:29.945
<i>but only half</i>
<i>of the costume actually was built.</i>

41:30.029 --> 41:33.407
<i>We built a maquette, which is like a doll,</i>
<i>which was the full size</i>

41:33.491 --> 41:36.535
that they're able
to use with visual effects.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.748
<i>There was a kind of movie magic</i>
<i>that went on with that costume</i>

41:40.831 --> 41:46.170
<i>because it had to perform, you know,</i>
<i>such fantastical things in the air,</i>

41:46.253 --> 41:48.964
<i>and spin and dive and all kinds of stuff</i>

41:49.048 --> 41:52.092
<i>that she would not have</i>
<i>been able to do in a full costume.</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:54.970
Old tech, functional but old.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.474
People are shooting at me.
Wait, let me put on my helmet.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.809
For now, tell it to go on.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.895
Once we realized
what the movie was gonna be,

42:02.978 --> 42:05.606
this version of the movie was gonna be,

42:06.607 --> 42:09.777
I realized that it was
a unique opportunity for me as a creative

42:09.902 --> 42:14.114
<i>to have a protagonist just go on</i>
<i>like, a transformative arc.</i>

42:15.533 --> 42:16.534
I'm not my brother.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.037
Namor will beg me for mercy...

42:21.288 --> 42:23.207
and I will stand and watch as he dies.

42:23.832 --> 42:27.127
You know, I was thankful
that Letitia's such an amazing actress,

42:27.253 --> 42:29.922
'cause this is not
the role that she auditioned for.

42:30.506 --> 42:33.050
We were really blessed
in terms of her being that versatile

42:33.133 --> 42:36.387
<i>that she could make you believe</i>
<i>that she was that younger sister</i>

42:36.470 --> 42:39.932
<i>who could have fun, you know,</i>
<i>with T'Challa and rib him,</i>

42:40.140 --> 42:42.935
<i>and feel youthful and like</i>
<i>she was full of love and light.</i>

42:43.018 --> 42:46.105
<i>And then become this character,</i>
<i>which is a totally different thing.</i>

42:47.565 --> 42:49.775
Was the herb not destroyed?

42:49.858 --> 42:52.695
Yes, I recreated it.

42:54.530 --> 42:55.531
With science?

42:56.448 --> 42:57.449
Yes.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.784
MOORE: <i>For us as storytellers,</i>

42:58.867 --> 43:04.456
I think Ramonda's passing was important
in bringing Shuri to her lowest,

43:04.540 --> 43:08.836
<i>and really breaking down this girl</i>
<i>whose spirit seemed unbreakable,</i>

43:08.919 --> 43:11.755
<i>to see what the breaking point might be.</i>

43:12.423 --> 43:15.050
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.306
My heart was buried with her.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.891
It was not a decision we made lightly

43:22.975 --> 43:26.645
because Ramonda's a fantastic character
and Angela Basset is a talented actress

43:27.271 --> 43:28.939
<i>and a part of the family.</i>

43:29.356 --> 43:30.357
Shuri.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.318
Show him...

43:32.818 --> 43:34.069
who you are.

43:35.821 --> 43:36.864

(CREW APPLAUDING)

43:42.786 --> 43:44.371
WRIGHT: <i>I'll be very honest.</i>

43:44.455 --> 43:49.877
When I read that Ramonda
was going to die by the hands of Namor,

43:50.669 --> 43:52.087
I was very upset.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.798
I think I almost cried
on the phone to Ryan.

43:54.882 --> 43:58.093
I was kinda like,
"What are you doing? What is this?"

43:58.677 --> 44:00.679
I'm so sorry about your mom.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.056
BASSETT: <i>I guess it's...</i>

44:04.475 --> 44:09.647
When you take an audience on a journey,
it's like you gotta grab them by the heart

44:09.730 --> 44:13.442
and rip it out of them,
I suppose, but I was...

44:13.525 --> 44:15.194
It took me a moment,

44:15.277 --> 44:18.280
<i>I had to process it,</i>
<i>I had to get over it.</i>

44:19.239 --> 44:22.451
For Ramonda, here's a woman
who has been girded by loss,

44:22.534 --> 44:26.330
who has become a very,
very successful queen of Wakanda,

44:26.413 --> 44:29.458
<i>and has done a great job in defending</i>
<i>her nation from all comers.</i>

44:29.625 --> 44:33.337
<i>And yet, her daughter is suffering from</i>
<i>depression over the loss of her brother</i>

44:33.504 --> 44:36.465
<i>and it's Ramonda's job to try</i>
<i>and pull Shuri out of this place</i>

44:36.548 --> 44:40.344
and let her see that there is the
potential to move forward through loss.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.389
When that illness
took your brother from us...

44:43.472 --> 44:47.476
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.270
But I still took time in the bush.

44:51.397 --> 44:55.401
My most precious resource
is my daughter at this point.

44:56.777 --> 45:00.280
You can imagine
with her husband and her son gone,

45:00.572 --> 45:04.827
that her embrace is that much,
you know, tighter around Shuri.

45:04.910 --> 45:07.830
<i>Physically, emotionally,</i>
<i>mentally, spiritually.</i>

45:07.913 --> 45:10.082
<i>And that's what a mother does,</i>

45:10.165 --> 45:12.710
<i>she does sacrifice</i>
<i>her life for her kids, you know,</i>

45:12.793 --> 45:15.587
and being a mother,
I know this all too well,

45:15.671 --> 45:17.297
<i>we'll do anything for them.</i>

45:17.965 --> 45:19.383
WRIGHT: <i>As we were doing it,</i>

45:20.092 --> 45:23.846
I realized, it did inspire Shuri's arc.

45:23.929 --> 45:29.309
<i>It did really inspire...</i>
<i>that thirst for vengeance</i>

45:29.393 --> 45:33.063
<i>that you'll see when Shuri</i>
<i>takes on the Black Panther mantle.</i>

45:37.943 --> 45:41.405
<i>Very early on,</i>
<i>Ryan explained to me where he was at</i>

45:41.488 --> 45:43.699
<i>and he asked me where I was at.</i>

45:43.782 --> 45:48.120
And he felt really strongly
that Chadwick would want us to continue.

45:48.203 --> 45:53.709
<i>He slowly explained to me</i>
<i>how we can honor Chad in this film,</i>

45:53.792 --> 45:57.713
and how we can honor
what was created by us as a family

45:58.547 --> 46:01.258
<i>and I started to realize</i>
<i>what he was saying.</i>

46:01.341 --> 46:04.136
And it was for me,
like a bittersweet experience

46:04.219 --> 46:07.723
<i>because Shuri does become</i>
<i>the Black Panther in the comic books.</i>

46:07.806 --> 46:13.645
But like, I didn't have
my brother to pass the torch to me.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.481
So...

46:17.316 --> 46:21.153
I had to, kinda like, process that.

46:21.862 --> 46:26.950
<i>And once I felt at peace</i>
<i>that it was the right thing,</i>

46:27.034 --> 46:30.078
<i>I accepted and I said</i>
<i>to Ryan, I'll do my best.</i>

46:30.162 --> 46:33.749
And I made a commitment, I was like,
I'll honor God and I'll honor Chad.

46:41.089 --> 46:44.885
<i>When I put the panther suit on,</i>
<i>it was a surreal moment.</i>

46:44.968 --> 46:46.386
<i>I did feel pretty cool</i>

46:46.470 --> 46:51.558
and they incorporated
a few Shuri elements from the first film.

46:51.642 --> 46:56.063
So Shuri had gauntlets and they kind of,
incorporated those into her suit.

46:56.146 --> 46:58.607
Essentially, we were working
with the design language of

46:58.690 --> 47:01.151
<i>silver being representative of T'Challa,</i>

47:01.235 --> 47:03.320
<i>gold being representative of T'Chaka,</i>

47:03.403 --> 47:06.114
<i>and the little bit of where</i>
<i>Killmonger's coming from.</i>

47:06.198 --> 47:08.826
And Shuri's design, we're essentially
taking those two elements

47:08.909 --> 47:09.952
<i>and combining them.</i>

47:10.035 --> 47:13.455
<i>So that she is taking what works</i>
<i>from each one of those methodologies</i>

47:13.539 --> 47:16.750
<i>and making them intertwine</i>
<i>into her Black Panther suit.</i>

47:16.875 --> 47:20.295
Finding her own voice with the things

47:20.712 --> 47:23.465
My first day in the suit,
I did feel really nervous.

47:24.091 --> 47:27.344
<i>I was like, am I meant</i>
<i>to walk like this, talk like this?</i>

47:27.427 --> 47:29.930
<i>And I just kept hearing</i>
<i>my brother saying like,</i>

47:30.013 --> 47:32.975
<i>"Calm down. It's cool, don't worry.</i>

47:33.058 --> 47:36.478
"And just keep going,
just keep walking and just be confident.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.063
"Just be confident."

How're we gonna get this action done?

<i>We also have to make sure</i>
<i>that in the choreographing of that scene,</i>

48:59.102 --> 49:03.148
<i>It's like a dance, everybody needs</i>
<i>to know exactly what step they're on.</i>

49:04.399 --> 49:07.611
Are you ready to bathe in the blood
of Wakanda's enemies?

49:13.742 --> 49:19.039
With some really great training,
it's just the physicality of the Jabari,

49:19.122 --> 49:21.959
where you get to dive
a little bit more into that.

49:22.042 --> 49:23.043
(GRUNTS)

49:24.169 --> 49:26.713
There will be no climbing here.

49:26.797 --> 49:29.341
The fight training was really incredible

49:29.424 --> 49:33.637
<i>and I always try to make</i>
<i>M'Baku feel like a strong man</i>

49:33.720 --> 49:36.890
<i>instead of like, a bodybuilder</i>
<i>or a guy that's about aesthetic.</i>

49:36.974 --> 49:40.894
<i>So, like, he has</i>
<i>a lot of weight culturally on his back.</i>

49:41.269 --> 49:42.854
<i>And he carries it with pride.</i>

49:44.398 --> 49:48.110
And that's a really big part
of what defines the character.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.322
MAN: Follow the chart.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.157
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

49:58.453 --> 49:59.871
TONEY: <i>Shuri versus Namor.</i>

49:59.955 --> 50:02.541
We put a lot into that fight.

50:02.833 --> 50:03.834
(SCREAMS)

50:12.426 --> 50:16.513
<i>And it's got a lot of heart and</i>
<i>there's so much weight behind this moment,</i>

50:16.596 --> 50:20.392
because you don't see
a lot of Shuri, you know, in action.

50:20.475 --> 50:23.687
So, when you do, it's gotta be impactful.

50:23.770 --> 50:24.771
Go!

50:25.856 --> 50:27.649
WRIGHT: <i>Yeah, it's a great payoff.</i>

50:27.733 --> 50:28.734
I'm so proud of it.

50:28.817 --> 50:31.445
<i>And Shuri's looking amazing,</i>
<i>Namor's looking amazing.</i>

50:34.322 --> 50:36.783
But something that is
very important to take into account

50:37.117 --> 50:38.535
was that Shuri is smart.

50:38.618 --> 50:41.079
<i>She uses her mind</i>
<i>before she uses her body.</i>

50:41.163 --> 50:45.208
There isn't a lot of flash,
there is more calculation.

50:45.292 --> 50:48.128
(GRUNTS)

50:48.754 --> 50:51.506
With Namor,
when it came to fighting styles,

50:51.590 --> 50:56.219
I pulled from not only sort of,
cultural aspects like Lucha Libre

50:56.303 --> 50:59.765
the sort of ball game that
they go out and play with their bodies,

50:59.848 --> 51:02.100
but also I pulled from Asian cultures.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.478
I pulled from a style called Baji

51:04.561 --> 51:09.024
and Baji is a style
that focusses on grounding your body

51:09.107 --> 51:11.109
<i>while delivering shoulder strikes,</i>

51:12.444 --> 51:15.197
elbow strikes,
so you're gonna see Namor do things

51:15.280 --> 51:17.449
that are unorthodox,

51:17.532 --> 51:19.743
but effective because
he is the person he is.

51:21.870 --> 51:26.792
Namor is more like, yeah,
the fight is not an explosion,

51:26.875 --> 51:30.087
it's little by little,
you know, he's more in control.

51:31.379 --> 51:34.716
TONEY: <i>It was fun to play around</i>
<i>with the wings, you know,</i>

51:34.800 --> 51:36.676
special, sort of like, quick attacks.

51:37.135 --> 51:38.470
<i>Or him boosting.</i>

51:40.097 --> 51:42.766
But also, they said,
can we rip the wings off?

51:45.018 --> 51:48.605
They grow back, he'll be fine,
but it gives you an opportunity

51:48.688 --> 51:53.193
to humanize this God-like character
and make him come to her.

51:53.276 --> 51:55.987
<i>And so that's</i>
<i>playing to Shuri being smart.</i>

52:09.084 --> 52:10.252
COOGLER: Shuri, look at me.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.423
See your Ma.

Time to show him who we are.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.854
Go get him.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.152
Go get him.

52:36.862 --> 52:38.071
Make him pay.

52:46.788 --> 52:49.249
WRIGHT: <i>For Shuri, it's kind of like</i>
<i>a coming of age moment</i>

52:49.332 --> 52:54.421
where she's thinking that,
processing in a way of violence.

52:54.504 --> 52:55.505
Wakanda forever!

53:00.177 --> 53:04.764
Processing in a way
of expressing her pain and her fury

53:05.473 --> 53:09.436
<i>towards Namor, she thinks that's gonna</i>
<i>be satisfying to her soul and it's not.</i>

53:10.270 --> 53:13.773
And I think that's
a beautiful way to complete that arc.

53:13.857 --> 53:17.861
To realize that,
wait, my brother wouldn't do this.

53:17.944 --> 53:19.779
<i>You know,</i>
<i>my mother wouldn't want this for me.</i>

53:19.863 --> 53:23.366
And she learns from that
and she becomes a woman,

53:23.450 --> 53:27.579
you know, we see Shuri
become a woman in her own right.

53:37.464 --> 53:41.593
Sometimes life imitates art
and art imitates life.

53:41.676 --> 53:46.681
<i>And I feel that this movie,</i>
<i>the art is imitating life.</i>

53:49.017 --> 53:51.895

53:53.980 --> 53:57.609

and about pain

<i>and the transformation</i>

54:03.949 --> 54:06.451
different people

Hopefully you see something in it
and it speaks to you in a way that...

54:12.123 --> 54:14.251
deals with things that you've been

54:14.334 --> 54:16.544
wrestling with
consciously or subconsciously.

54:16.628 --> 54:19.881

54:47.701 --> 54:49.286
<i>'cause we'd become like family.</i>

WRIGHT: <i>Having the support of Ryan,</i>

55:05.885 --> 55:10.724
he just confidently, always would say,
"Hey, Tish, like, you could do this."

<i>You gotta keep inspiring people.</i>

55:16.521 --> 55:19.983
And I'm praying
that that will be the result for Shuri,

55:20.066 --> 55:23.445
that as she's growing and she's evolving,

55:23.528 --> 55:25.905
<i>that later down the line we can be like,</i>

I think part
of the reason you make this movie

56:20.919 --> 56:22.545
is it changes perspective.

56:24.422 --> 56:26.966
<i>People can see</i>
