00:36.828 --> 00:38.329
JANE: You said you were coming back.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.666
Where were you?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.793
THOR: <i>Bifrost was destroyed.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:46.046
<i>The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.298
<i>Wars were raging,</i>
<i>marauders were pillaging.</i>

00:48.798 --> 00:50.717
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.721
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.643
JANE: <i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>there's a connection</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:03.354
<i>between these atmospheric disturbances</i>
<i>and my research.</i>

01:04.606 --> 01:05.648
Go!

01:10.945 --> 01:12.572
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.201
-Name?
-He said it was Thor?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.827
And your relationship to him?

01:17.911 --> 01:18.995
I've never met him before.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.705
You saw what I saw last night.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.123
<i>He's promising us the answers.</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:24.000
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.335
Everything?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.963
God, I hope you're not crazy.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.676
Your world is one
of the Nine Realms of the cosmos.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.263
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.767
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.102
JANE: Look, what do you see?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.604
-Stars.
-Yeah, but not our stars.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.857
<i>If there's an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,</i>
<i>then something's on the other side.</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.567
Advanced beings
could have crossed it.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.693
Jane.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.447
You won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.949
Not without hard evidence.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.039
Was somebody else coming?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.457
THOR: <i>Jane, you have to leave.</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:06.251
If you're staying, then so am I.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.091
What's he doing?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.801
(GROANS)

02:19.722 --> 02:21.808
Oh. My. God.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
So, is this how you normally look?

02:24.310 --> 02:25.979
-More or less.
-It's a good look.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.526
THOR: <i>I must go back to Asgard,</i>
<i>but I give you my word,</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:34.237
<i>I will return for you.</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:37.740
<i>How is she?</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:39.742
HEIMDALL: <i>She's quite clever, your mortal.</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:43.454
<i>She doesn't know it yet,</i>
<i>but she studies the Convergence as well.</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:50.837
THOR: What?

02:52.088 --> 02:53.256
I can't see her.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.383
DARCY: Jane!

02:55.925 --> 02:57.677
<i>Tell me you didn't call the police.</i>

02:57.760 --> 02:59.304
You were gone for five hours.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.430
What?

03:00.680 --> 03:03.391
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.809
<i>You have to come with me.</i>

03:06.477 --> 03:07.478
THOR: Jane!

03:10.857 --> 03:12.609
<i>This is not of Earth. What is it?</i>

03:12.901 --> 03:13.985
We do not know.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.488
<i>But she will not survive the amount</i>
<i>of energy surging within her.</i>

03:17.572 --> 03:19.449
THOR: I brought her here
because we can help her.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.534
She does not belong here in Asgard

03:21.618 --> 03:24.996
any more than a goat belongs
at a banquet table.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.707
Did he just... Who do you think you are?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.001
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.170
Oh.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.672
-Well, I'm...
-I know very well who you are,

03:34.756 --> 03:35.882
Jane Foster.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.343
You told your dad about me?

03:38.760 --> 03:39.802
No, I would not...

03:39.886 --> 03:40.970
(GRUNTS)

03:41.387 --> 03:43.181
JANE: <i>What's going to happen to me?</i>

03:43.556 --> 03:45.475
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.022
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.983
I'm Loki, you may have
heard of me. (GRUNTS)

03:54.359 --> 03:55.735
That was for New York.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.819
I like her.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.698
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

04:00.782 --> 04:01.783
Possibly.

04:01.866 --> 04:05.119
Malekith! I am Loki of Jotunheim

04:05.620 --> 04:07.372
<i>and I bring you a gift.</i>

04:11.584 --> 04:14.337
Malekith is gonna destroy everything.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.049
SELVIG: Are you sure
this is going to work?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.593
You might want to hold on to something.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.346
That is awesome!

04:35.775 --> 04:36.859
JANE: Thor!
