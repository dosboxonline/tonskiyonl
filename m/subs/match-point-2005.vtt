01:13.000 --> 01:15.900
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

01:15.900 --> 01:18.100
saw deeply into life.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.100
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.200
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

01:31.200 --> 01:35.800
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.700
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.200
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.100
Sorry.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.100
Mr. Townsend.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.200
Just this way.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.400
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.000
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.100
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.700
Yeah, so I see.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.800
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

02:17.900 --> 02:19.600
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

02:19.700 --> 02:23.000
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

02:23.100 --> 02:27.400
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.300
You have to really want it.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.300
Not that I have their talent.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.400
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.400
And you want to live in London?

02:36.400 --> 02:39.500
Very much. Very much.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.800
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.700
You can begin this weekend?

02:45.600 --> 02:48.200
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.300
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.200
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

02:55.300 --> 02:57.300
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.800
You can just open it up, get your kip.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.000
Kitchen just through there.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.500
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

03:05.600 --> 03:06.800
All that stuff.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.400
Lovely view, not overlooked.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
So it's all good.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.000
This is 225 a week?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.700
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.600
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.500
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.700
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.800
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.600
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.200
Very good.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.300
Chris Wilton.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.200
This is Tom Hewett.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.200
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.000
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.800
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.000
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

04:13.100 --> 04:16.399
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

04:16.399 --> 04:18.000
Don't worry, it comes back.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.600
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.000
OK.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.200
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.300
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.100
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.500
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

04:44.600 --> 04:46.400
you held your own more than admirably.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.900
For a while.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.500
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.300
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.900
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
Get your dirty great forehand off.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.200
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.100
So, do you need a lift after this?

05:03.200 --> 05:06.800
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.500
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.700
And they'll have a decent opera section?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.800
Opera? You like opera, really?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.200
I love opera.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.400
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.300
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

05:21.400 --> 05:23.700
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.800
To the opera?

05:26.900 --> 05:29.300
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.900
It's La bloody Traviata.

05:31.900 --> 05:35.000
My God. I'd love to.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.900
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.600
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.800
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.900
So?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.200
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.000
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.000
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.900
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

06:01.000 --> 06:02.200
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.900
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.600
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.800
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.200
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.400
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.800
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.400
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.200
Frighteningly so at times. But...

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

07:23.300 --> 07:26.200
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.200
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

07:29.300 --> 07:33.600
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.900
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.800
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

07:55.900 --> 07:58.000
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.100
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
Lt'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.400
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.300
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.400
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.300
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.200
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.000
OK.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.200
Was I dreadful?

08:40.299 --> 08:43.100
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.400
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.400
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.400
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.600
It all came so easy at first.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.200
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.200
I mean, it's OK for now,

09:03.300 --> 09:06.000
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.900
I'd like to do something with my life.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.600
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.900
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.700
I love it.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.200
It's so exciting and alive.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.600
I've never seen so much art or theater.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.800
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.600
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

09:26.600 --> 09:30.400
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.700
That'd be great.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.700
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.500
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

09:37.600 --> 09:40.400
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.100
But actually,
I did read something about the...

09:43.200 --> 09:45.500
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.400
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.700
You're very kind to offer this.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.200
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

09:54.200 --> 09:55.900
OK, it's a deal.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.400
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.000
I can do that.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.500
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.300
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.300
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.500
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.300
So who's my next victim?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.600
You?

11:14.200 --> 11:16.200
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.800
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.200
What did I walk into?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.600
What did I walk into?

11:37.900 --> 11:39.900
It's like this.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.700
- May I?
- Please.

11:44.500 --> 11:49.000
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.800
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.000
The story of my life.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.600
So, tell me,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.400
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

12:01.500 --> 12:03.700
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

12:08.500 --> 12:12.900
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

12:15.600 --> 12:18.500
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

12:22.700 --> 12:25.900
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Is it off-putting?

12:30.900 --> 12:33.500
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.000
There you are.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.100
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.300
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiancÃ©e.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.500
So, you're the tennis pro.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.600
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.000
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.900
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.000
He's made a living out of hustling.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.100
I'll be ready for you next time.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.500
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.500
She's quite something, isn't she?

13:16.700 --> 13:19.700
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.900
Jesus, yeah, six months!

13:22.000 --> 13:24.400
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

13:24.500 --> 13:26.600
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

13:26.700 --> 13:29.300
...one thing led to another.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.100
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

13:33.200 --> 13:34.700
that I'm serious about her, but...

13:34.800 --> 13:35.800
To be honest with you,

13:35.900 --> 13:38.100
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

13:38.200 --> 13:41.500
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.700
Especially an American one.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.600
But I am crazy about her.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.400
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.500
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.100
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

13:57.100 --> 14:00.500
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.900
These afternoons have been great.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.900
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.600
Yes, it's fun.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.300
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
Do you need money?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.500
God, no.

14:57.700 --> 14:59.300
No, I'm fine.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.100
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.800
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.300
Shall we go to your place or mine?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.700
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

15:34.700 --> 15:38.600
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.900
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.600
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.500
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.400
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.700
Well, I find him very likeable.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.300
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

16:17.300 --> 16:21.600
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
Can't we do something for him?

16:23.700 --> 16:26.100
A place in one of
your companies or something?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.400
Has he expressed a desire?

16:27.500 --> 16:31.100
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.500
He really wants
to make something of his life.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.600
Chloe, be careful.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.600
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.600
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.500
She's spoilt and temperamental.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.400
She's an actress, they're emotional.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.700
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.100
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.500
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.599
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.099
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.099
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.099
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

17:19.300 --> 17:23.400
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.000
Did you say anything?

17:25.099 --> 17:29.500
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

17:29.500 --> 17:32.400
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.100
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.100
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.700
Thanks.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.700
What do you think?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.800
I'm gonna have to think about it.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.700
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

17:52.200 --> 17:56.500
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.300
I don't know, really.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.800
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.600
I think it is.

18:05.700 --> 18:09.100
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.800
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

18:12.900 --> 18:15.100
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.000
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.100
It's not exactly office work.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.700
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
To?

18:25.900 --> 18:29.900
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

18:29.900 --> 18:32.900
greater earning potential, I don't know.

18:33.500 --> 18:38.000
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.300
Of course.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.500
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.700
I've always admired
men like your father.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.200
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.300
Enjoying his fortune.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.600
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.000
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.900
He's a very generous man.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.700
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.300
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.200
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.100
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

19:15.100 --> 19:18.800
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.300
I will. I promise.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.400
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.700
Hi, guys.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.100
Hello.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.600
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

19:34.700 --> 19:38.400
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.300
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.600
Oh, God. Shut up.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.300
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

19:45.300 --> 19:48.500
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.400
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

19:52.500 --> 19:54.700
I want an Aston Martin.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.700
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

19:56.700 --> 20:00.100
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.300
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.300
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.100
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.400
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.600
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

20:16.700 --> 20:19.300
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.700
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.500
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.900
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.900
Nothing to start?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.600
Oh, I think the wine list.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.100
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.000
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

20:38.100 --> 20:40.700
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.500
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.500
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.100
"So-so."

20:47.200 --> 20:51.100
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.100
He'll have the blinis.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.900
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.900
He was kind of austere.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.100
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
Oh, Christ.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.200
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.700
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.100
What were you saying about Hedley?

21:12.100 --> 21:14.800
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.700
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.300
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.200
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.000
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.700
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

21:28.800 --> 21:31.400
It was a commercial, not a movie.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.200
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

21:34.300 --> 21:38.000
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.500
Oh, you just need a break.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.700
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.900
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.700
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

21:45.800 --> 21:49.000
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.300
I mean, it seems scientists are...

21:51.400 --> 21:55.200
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

21:55.300 --> 21:58.200
No purpose, no design.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.000
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.900
And I envy you for it.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.700
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

22:08.800 --> 22:11.200
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

22:11.300 --> 22:13.600
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.900
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.600
Can we change the subject, please?

22:16.700 --> 22:20.000
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.700
No, I was...

22:21.800 --> 22:26.400
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.900
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.600
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.000
Ever.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.600
Have you decided on a wine?

22:38.500 --> 22:41.600
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.100
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.800
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.000
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.600
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.000
Hi, Alan. How are you?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.600
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

22:53.700 --> 22:56.900
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.900
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.700
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.500
Now, if you're OK with the package,

23:03.600 --> 23:05.700
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.700
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.800
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

23:09.900 --> 23:10.900
And Rod.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.100
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.600
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.800
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.400
It's such good news.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.100
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.700
Wow. Thank you.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.200
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.100
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

23:38.800 --> 23:41.800
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.900
It has some beautiful arias on it.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.700
And his voice expresses

23:45.700 --> 23:48.100
everything that's tragic about life.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.800
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.600
I love it.

23:59.300 --> 24:03.800
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.400
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.000
Puligny-Montrachet.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.400
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.800
Now I'm addicted.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.600
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

24:17.700 --> 24:19.400
but I told them we're busy.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.100
But we have no plans.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.100
Well, no special plans.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.100
I thought we said we'd stay in?

24:29.800 --> 24:32.700
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.400
We could've joined them.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.900
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

24:38.700 --> 24:42.300
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

24:43.100 --> 24:46.400
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.800
Well, shall I call them?

24:50.900 --> 24:53.500
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.900
Well...

24:56.900 --> 24:59.800
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.400
The wine, the opera.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.500
Absolutely.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.800
I just figured...

25:17.700 --> 25:20.500
We can stay in any... any night, and...

25:21.100 --> 25:23.500
...they're free and suggested a film.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.900
What's the film?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.700
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.600
I am in the mood for a film.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.800
Thank you so much, fella.

25:39.500 --> 25:44.000
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.300
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.900
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.300
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.400
Where is she?

25:54.600 --> 25:57.900
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.100
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.700
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.900
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.500
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.300
Everybody likes you at work.

26:12.900 --> 26:16.000
Papa says he's heard great things.

26:18.100 --> 26:20.700
You're a very clever boy.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.100
Hey!

26:40.400 --> 26:41.800
Hey.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.500
- Hi.
- How are you?

26:43.500 --> 26:47.200
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.100
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
It's vicuÃ±a.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.100
- VicuÃ±a.
- VicuÃ±a?

26:54.100 --> 26:55.400
- Yeah.
- Right.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.500
Where are you going?

26:56.600 --> 26:59.300
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

26:59.300 --> 27:00.300
- Why?
- So...

27:00.400 --> 27:02.900
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

27:02.900 --> 27:07.500
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.200
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

27:11.300 --> 27:13.700
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.300
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

27:18.300 --> 27:22.600
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

27:22.700 --> 27:25.700
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

27:26.700 --> 27:29.400
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.600
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.100
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.700
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.000
Have you ever tried yoga?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.800
- No.
- No?

28:37.500 --> 28:39.000
Hi.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.100
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.900
- How was it?
- Blew that.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.200
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

28:46.300 --> 28:49.900
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

28:50.500 --> 28:52.200
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.600
Yeah.

28:54.800 --> 28:55.900
You know what,

28:55.900 --> 28:58.800
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

28:58.900 --> 29:00.300
...a little bit.
- Sure.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.400
- OK.
- This way.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.700
What was I saying?

29:19.400 --> 29:22.600
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

29:22.700 --> 29:25.400
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.800
You should see my sister, she's...

29:27.900 --> 29:33.000
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

29:33.100 --> 29:35.900
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.500
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

29:40.600 --> 29:42.300
My sister...

29:43.300 --> 29:46.200
...is classically beautiful.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.300
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

29:53.100 --> 29:56.300
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.900
It's just a joke.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.500
What did your father do?

30:04.500 --> 30:07.300
He... left.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.000
And never sent any money.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.400
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.200
- No?
- No.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.700
Her problem was that she drank.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.900
How did you meet Tom?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.100
We met at a party.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.400
He...

30:30.500 --> 30:32.200
...saw me across the room

30:32.300 --> 30:36.500
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
And I...

30:38.100 --> 30:39.900
I liked him right off, you know.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.800
I thought...

30:42.600 --> 30:44.800
Well, I think he's very handsome.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.100
Don't you?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.100
Very.

30:48.100 --> 30:50.400
And he asked you to marry him?

30:52.900 --> 30:54.700
Well, he...

30:54.700 --> 30:59.500
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

30:59.600 --> 31:01.500
What did I know
about that kind of life?

31:01.600 --> 31:04.700
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.300
But...

31:06.700 --> 31:10.800
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

31:10.900 --> 31:14.600
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.100
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

31:17.200 --> 31:20.100
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.700
It's such an inbred family. It's...

31:22.700 --> 31:25.100
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

31:29.700 --> 31:32.100
I thought he was very handsome.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.100
You know, and I told you I was just...

31:35.600 --> 31:38.600
I was overwhelmed with attention.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.900
So, what about you and Chloe?

31:46.900 --> 31:48.900
She's very sweet.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
She is very sweet.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.300
And she wants to marry you.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.900
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.200
No. No, it's different.

32:03.300 --> 32:06.700
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
...are being groomed.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.500
You mark my words.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.000
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

32:15.000 --> 32:17.700
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.300
But...

32:22.300 --> 32:26.400
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.600
And how am I going to blow it?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.600
By making a pass at me.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.200
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

32:42.400 --> 32:44.800
Men always seem to wonder.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.900
They think I'd be
something very special.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.900
And are you?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.900
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.500
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

33:11.100 --> 33:13.300
I've had too much to drink.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.700
Can you get me a cab?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.800
Sure.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.100
Thank you.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.100
You were driving a bit fast,

33:42.200 --> 33:43.700
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.700
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

33:46.700 --> 33:47.700
Oh, hi.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.000
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

33:49.100 --> 33:51.100
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.600
Oh, he's so sweet.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.600
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

33:54.700 --> 33:56.600
It should have dissipated fully already.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.900
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.600
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

34:00.800 --> 34:03.600
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

34:03.700 --> 34:06.400
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.400
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
You're so beautiful.

34:10.500 --> 34:15.800
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

34:15.800 --> 34:18.100
that the company would pay for?

34:18.199 --> 34:19.800
I don't know.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.500
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.699
And the beginning of next year

34:28.800 --> 34:31.699
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

34:31.699 --> 34:35.699
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.600
Plus, there are a number of perks...

34:38.600 --> 34:42.699
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.300
We had been focusing on someone else...

34:46.199 --> 34:49.699
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.199
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.800
I'd hate to disappoint you.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.600
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

34:57.700 --> 34:59.600
We're nearly ready.

34:59.700 --> 35:02.100
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.100
Never mind, fella.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.800
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.700
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.200
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.300
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.500
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Come on, Chloe.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.400
Hi, darling.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.100
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.500
No.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.300
How did your audition go?

35:32.400 --> 35:35.700
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.600
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.500
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.000
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.400
So, how long do you keep it up?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.200
How long?

35:54.300 --> 35:57.600
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

35:57.700 --> 36:02.200
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

36:02.300 --> 36:05.000
To try something else?

36:05.300 --> 36:07.700
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.800
I'm not saying that.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.500
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

36:11.600 --> 36:15.300
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

36:15.400 --> 36:19.500
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

36:19.600 --> 36:21.800
Well, I do ask myself that.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.000
See? It's only logical, Tom.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.400
Especially for a woman.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.300
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

36:29.400 --> 36:32.100
and as you get older and time passes,

36:32.200 --> 36:34.400
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.000
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.700
I'm not saying now.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.700
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.800
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

36:48.900 --> 36:51.400
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.600
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

36:53.700 --> 36:55.700
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

36:55.800 --> 36:59.700
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

36:59.800 --> 37:01.200
...innuendos.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.900
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Those that have it, know it right off.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.600
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

37:08.700 --> 37:11.500
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.600
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.500
Excuse me.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.200
Nola.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.400
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.400
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

37:22.500 --> 37:24.700
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.300
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.600
I was looking for you.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.800
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.800
I don't mean to intrude.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.000
I need a drink.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.800
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.900
- Do I?
- Yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.300
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.000
You shouldn't have followed me here.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.100
Do you feel guilty?

39:07.400 --> 39:09.400
Do you?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.400
We can't do this.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I know.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.200
This can't lead anyplace.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.100
Hello.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.100
Darling, I think it's for you.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.000
But take it outside.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.600
Well, there's hope, at least.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.900
When's the callback?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.100
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

41:18.100 --> 41:21.300
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

41:22.500 --> 41:25.200
Yeah. OK.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.300
Bye.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.100
Why have you been so cold to me?

41:29.200 --> 41:31.900
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.100
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

41:34.200 --> 41:36.600
you've been distant, evasive.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.800
I don't want to encourage anything.

41:38.900 --> 41:41.200
What happened, happened, Chris.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.300
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

41:44.300 --> 41:47.000
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.800
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

41:49.900 --> 41:53.900
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.300
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

41:57.900 --> 42:01.000
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

42:01.100 --> 42:03.900
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

42:03.900 --> 42:05.300
We had our moment.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.800
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.100
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

42:10.700 --> 42:13.200
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.500
Chris, forget it. It's over.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.100
Thanks. Henry!

42:31.200 --> 42:33.900
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

42:33.900 --> 42:35.500
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.800
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

42:37.900 --> 42:39.600
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

42:39.700 --> 42:41.400
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.900
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.500
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

42:46.600 --> 42:49.300
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.100
I just couldn't stand it.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.500
No. No, I heard you went into business.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.800
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.300
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.900
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.600
Family's got nothing but money.

43:02.700 --> 43:05.900
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.000
Hey, look, I understand.

43:07.100 --> 43:09.800
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

43:09.900 --> 43:12.400
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

43:12.500 --> 43:13.900
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.900
I always admired
your game though, you know?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.400
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.100
Cool under pressure, but creative.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.300
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.800
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.700
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.800
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

43:26.800 --> 43:29.100
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.500
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

43:30.600 --> 43:32.300
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

43:32.300 --> 43:34.000
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.100
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.500
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.700
So good to see you, Henry.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.200
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.600
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.700
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

43:45.800 --> 43:46.900
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.800
- All right.
- Bye.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.300
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

43:50.300 --> 43:53.600
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

43:53.700 --> 43:55.700
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

43:55.700 --> 43:58.300
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

43:58.300 --> 43:59.300
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.700
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.800
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

44:03.900 --> 44:05.800
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

44:05.900 --> 44:06.900
Stop it.

44:06.900 --> 44:09.000
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

44:09.100 --> 44:10.900
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.200
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

44:12.300 --> 44:15.700
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

44:15.700 --> 44:18.000
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

44:18.100 --> 44:21.100
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.500
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

44:23.500 --> 44:24.900
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.100
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.500
I appreciate that.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.200
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

45:13.600 --> 45:16.000
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.200
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

45:18.200 --> 45:20.200
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

45:20.300 --> 45:21.600
It was all her fault, you know.

45:21.700 --> 45:24.500
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

45:24.600 --> 45:26.600
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

45:26.600 --> 45:29.000
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.200
All men who see you want to attack you.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.400
Isn't that right, Christopher?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.100
Oh, God, are you all right?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.500
I'm fine.

45:39.600 --> 45:41.900
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

45:44.600 --> 45:47.900
I now pronounce you man and wife.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You may kiss the bride.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Oh, my God.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.300
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

46:11.300 --> 46:13.300
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
There's another bedroom through there.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.400
The bathroom and a kitchen.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.500
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.600
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

46:22.700 --> 46:26.400
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.400
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

46:29.900 --> 46:33.200
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.500
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

46:35.600 --> 46:37.600
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.800
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.800
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.900
I want you to make me pregnant.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.300
Chloe... We discussed this.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.300
It's very quick.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.400
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

46:59.200 --> 47:02.200
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

47:04.300 --> 47:07.300
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

47:14.100 --> 47:16.700
Hey! Where are you?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

47:21.100 --> 47:22.800
Not good.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.800
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.000
What?

47:29.500 --> 47:31.400
Well, Nola and I...

47:31.500 --> 47:33.300
...broke up.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.600
- No!
- Yeah.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.900
Or, I should say, I called it off.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.600
I thought you were gonna get married.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.800
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

47:43.900 --> 47:46.500
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.700
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.400
who's her main candidate.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.300
God, no.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.200
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.700
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

48:00.800 --> 48:03.200
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

48:04.200 --> 48:06.200
...l've met someone else.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.300
- No!
- Yeah.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.600
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

48:12.700 --> 48:16.000
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

48:16.100 --> 48:19.400
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

48:20.500 --> 48:22.400
You know what I mean.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.900
The number you are calling
is not available.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.200
The number you are calling
is not available.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
Excuse me.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.200
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

49:08.200 --> 49:12.000
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

49:14.700 --> 49:17.600
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

49:18.900 --> 49:21.400
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.300
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.100
Just business.

49:38.500 --> 49:41.200
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

49:41.300 --> 49:43.800
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.000
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

49:48.900 --> 49:51.100
OK, I can take a hint.

49:55.400 --> 49:59.800
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

49:59.900 --> 50:01.300
Look...

50:02.100 --> 50:03.700
...it'll happen.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.200
I'm just really tired.

50:06.900 --> 50:08.600
Kiss.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.100
Sweet dreams.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.400
I now pronounce you man and wife.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.600
You may kiss the bride.

50:35.800 --> 50:39.700
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

50:42.700 --> 50:42.800
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.700
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.000
I know.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.300
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

50:49.400 --> 50:52.400
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

50:52.500 --> 50:54.500
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.000
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I want my own children.

51:00.600 --> 51:01.900
This one?

51:03.300 --> 51:04.300
Sort of...

51:04.400 --> 51:06.800
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

51:06.900 --> 51:08.100
Really?

51:08.200 --> 51:10.100
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.200
Her and her husband
just found each other.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.200
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

51:15.300 --> 51:17.300
and itjust works like a charm.

51:17.400 --> 51:21.600
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.400
- God...
- I know, it's great.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.500
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

51:28.200 --> 51:31.100
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.300
If I have to work all night.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.400
OK.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.600
Thank you. Thanks.

51:49.100 --> 51:51.300
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

51:59.200 --> 52:00.400
Thanks.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.000
Are you OK, sir?

52:06.400 --> 52:09.900
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

52:11.100 --> 52:13.600
No, not really.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.200
Oh, Christ!

52:18.300 --> 52:20.300
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

52:20.300 --> 52:22.400
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.700
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.300
Not before.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.200
Good night.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.400
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.300
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

53:25.400 --> 53:26.800
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

53:26.900 --> 53:29.200
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.200
Yeah?

53:30.300 --> 53:32.100
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

53:32.200 --> 53:34.000
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

53:34.100 --> 53:35.100
Why?

53:35.200 --> 53:38.100
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.800
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

53:40.900 --> 53:41.900
I'm coming.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.600
- OK.
- OK.

54:43.400 --> 54:44.800
Hello.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.100
What a surprise.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.500
I...

54:49.600 --> 54:53.300
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

54:53.400 --> 54:57.100
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

54:57.200 --> 54:59.800
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

55:00.100 --> 55:04.100
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.300
I looked for you.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.300
For what?

55:10.400 --> 55:12.400
You're still so angry.

55:15.700 --> 55:17.400
Where are you living?

55:18.200 --> 55:20.800
In town. Why?

55:22.400 --> 55:23.700
You live alone?

55:23.800 --> 55:27.300
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

55:28.800 --> 55:30.800
Can I meet you for a drink?

55:30.900 --> 55:32.700
Talk?

55:34.300 --> 55:37.200
Where can I reach you? Come on.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.400
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.500
Look who I bumped into.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.400
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

55:47.500 --> 55:49.800
- You look great.
- Thanks.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.500
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

55:52.700 --> 55:55.800
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

55:55.900 --> 55:58.500
Yeah. They've got a baby.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.700
You know Tom, all settled down.

56:00.800 --> 56:03.400
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

56:03.500 --> 56:05.800
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

56:05.900 --> 56:07.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:07.700 --> 56:10.700
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

56:10.700 --> 56:13.800
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

56:13.900 --> 56:16.200
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

56:16.300 --> 56:19.100
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

56:19.100 --> 56:20.500
Say your phone number.

56:20.600 --> 56:24.000
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

56:24.100 --> 56:25.700
- Chris...
- Please.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.900
Say your phone number.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.100
02079460996.

56:37.300 --> 56:39.000
I'll call you.

56:40.300 --> 56:41.300
Bye.

56:44.900 --> 56:46.900
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

56:46.900 --> 56:48.900
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

56:48.900 --> 56:51.600
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

56:51.700 --> 56:53.800
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.200
It's OK, John.

56:55.300 --> 56:57.100
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

56:57.100 --> 56:58.900
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

56:58.900 --> 57:01.500
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.700
- OK.
- See you at home.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Bye.

57:37.300 --> 57:39.400
You have a very charming flat.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.300
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.100
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

57:48.500 --> 57:50.000
I mean, it's not perfect.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

57:53.100 --> 57:55.200
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

57:56.000 --> 57:59.100
...you know, the lobby's decent.

57:59.700 --> 58:02.100
The key word is it's cheap.

58:03.400 --> 58:05.000
What time is it?

58:05.600 --> 58:07.200
Time for you to go.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.700
It's so hard to leave you.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Beautiful woman.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.700
How'd you sleep?

58:24.900 --> 58:26.300
Good.

58:29.700 --> 58:32.100
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

58:32.200 --> 58:34.200
about that earthquake in China?

58:36.100 --> 58:37.800
Terrible.

58:39.900 --> 58:41.900
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

58:41.900 --> 58:44.900
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

58:44.900 --> 58:46.300
Yeah.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.100
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

59:02.200 --> 59:04.500
Papa's getting so into the idea.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.800
It should be good for you.

59:08.700 --> 59:11.100
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

59:12.700 --> 59:15.500
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

59:15.500 --> 59:17.500
...before you went to work.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.700
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

59:20.700 --> 59:24.200
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

59:26.100 --> 59:29.200
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.900
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

59:44.700 --> 59:47.200
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

59:47.300 --> 59:48.700
Let me come up.

59:48.800 --> 59:51.700
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

59:51.700 --> 59:54.100
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

59:57.400 --> 59:59.700
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.200
Come on.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.700
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.100
Hey, did you get that pest control?

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.400
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.900
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.400
It's much better than cheese,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.800
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.300
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.900
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.100
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200
Bye.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.500
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.600
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.200
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.600
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.900
Yeah.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.600
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.600
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.100
Heths didn't have a problem

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:19.100
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.100
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.200
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.500
- No.
- Yeah.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.300
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.300
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.000
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.700
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.900
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.400
But she's just such an odd girl.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.300
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.200
But something's just...

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.900
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.500
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.800
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.600
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.800
but, I don't know...

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.200
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.300
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.800
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.700
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.600
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.800
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.200
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.200
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.400
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.800
I know Tom's dying to get away.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.400
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.500
Me?

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.700
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.800
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.700
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.900
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.500
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.700
I'd have sworn it was you.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.900
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.900
He's completely dependant on our driver.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.200
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:53.000
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.300
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.900
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.200
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.600
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.000
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.200
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300
Nuts.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.000
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.900
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.200
Just the Sarazin people at two.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.400
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.700
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.400
Chris. Where are you off to?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.600
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.800
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.800
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.800
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.600
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.600
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.100
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.700
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.900
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.800
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.300
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.800
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.900
It's a hard field.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.400
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.400
Tom's mother was right.
Itjust gets to a point, you know?

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.200
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.200
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.400
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.100
Maybe I will.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.600
Don't say that unless you mean it.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.700
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.800
I mean, it's... mechanical.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.200
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.500
Really. I mean it.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.000
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.800
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.100
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.000
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.200
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.800
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.500
Hi.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.900
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.500
I've been thinking about you.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.200
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.100
OK. See you then.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.800
Bye-bye.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.300
There you are, Chris.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.800
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.600
over the past few months.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.600
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.500
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.400
Well, who could have predicted these?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.700
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.600
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.200
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.400
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.500
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.000
Yes.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.700
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800
- Boat.
- Boat.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.000
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.600
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.900
- What?
- No.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.500
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.400
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Oh, that reminds me,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.000
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.100
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.700
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.600
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.300
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.300
Oh, God.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.900
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.900
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.800
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.600
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.600
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.700
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.700
Poor thing.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.400
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.500
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.200
I miss you.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.000
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.600
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.800
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.900
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.600
When can you get here?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.100
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.500
Look...

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.900
It's a three-day weekend.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.700
Tuesday.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.300
Chris, I need to see you.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.100
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.600
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.700
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.300
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.800
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.800
Jack Garner?

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.900
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.300
The traffic'll be terrible.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.800
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.800
I don't mean today.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.600
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.000
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.899
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:21.500
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.300
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.399
That's mean.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.500
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.000
I've some lovely new horses.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.700
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.700
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.899
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.800
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:37.500
- No.
- Yeah.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.100
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.300
- Where from?
- Anyway...

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.700
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.600
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.200
Excuse me.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.300
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.399
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

01:08:58.899 --> 01:08:59.899
Hello?

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:02.100
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.500
Are you mad calling me here?

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.800
When are you coming over?

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.899
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.000
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.899
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.100
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.700
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.800
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.500
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.100
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.500
Well, they only had biscuits.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.899
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.800
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:45.000
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.300
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:49.700
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.899
It's no big deal.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.100
I'll pop back into town.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:57.200
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.000
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.700
Well, it is a pity because I...

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.900
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.400
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.600
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.300
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.900
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:10.900
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.100
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.800
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.700
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.300
but you couldn't wait.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.100
What unbelievable bad luck.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.000
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.900
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.700
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.800
Is that your interpretation?

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.000
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.600
not as part of some fertility project.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.600
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.500
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.100
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.700
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.500
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.600
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.700
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.700
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.700
Why? You hate yourjob,
you hate your life.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.500
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.200
Look, Nola, I have to go.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.900
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.900
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.200
Chris...

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.400
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.000
I'm not walking away from this.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.600
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.000
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.100
Us.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.600
Is something wrong?

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.800
Yeah. There is.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.300
What?

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.400
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.000
you know it's not a problem.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.200
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.600
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.200
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.900
What is it?

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.800
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.200
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.900
Are you having an affair?

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.100
Am I having an affair?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.300
Yeah, that's what I asked.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.700
- No.
- You are.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.900
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.300
Do you not love me anymore?

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.700
Of course I love you.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.100
Well, what's wrong?

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.500
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.600
You're not. How?

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.200
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.500
I just...

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.600
...feel so guilty.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.100
So terribly guilty.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.500
Listen, Chris.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.000
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.500
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.500
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.200
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.900
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.100
Oh, Chloe.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.300
Let's get off the subject.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.300
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.100
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.800
I had to talk to somebody.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.400
I'm really suffering.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.600
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.800
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.200
But when the time came to tell her...

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.800
...I couldn't do it.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.400
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.200
It's crazy.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.200
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.700
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.100
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.700
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.500
Right.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.400
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.000
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.900
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.400
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.600
Is it for a woman you love?

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.400
To live how? Where?

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.700
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.700
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.800
There must be anotherjob in another
firm that you can just, you know...

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.900
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.100
And he loves me.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.700
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.400
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.300
We're going away for three weeks.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.400
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.900
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.200
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.500
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.500
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.600
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.100
which is all you ever tell me...

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.900
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.200
It's a big blow.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.400
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.900
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.000
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.700
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.900
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.200
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.300
Hey, keep your voice down.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.500
You know I make love to her.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.100
And you know it's just routine.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.500
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.500
Yeah.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.700
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.400
It will.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:35.000
- It will.
- OK.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.400
The holiday's off.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.900
Why? What happened?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.200
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.400
Why?

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.900
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.700
Anyway, he needs recovery time

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.100
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.600
Let me just pack up my stuff.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:59.200
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.100
Hello?

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.100
Hello?

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.200
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.200
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.300
Really?

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.400
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.600
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.100
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.400
assuming our predictions are correct.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.900
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.900
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.900
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.100
You already are a young grandmother.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.400
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500
but I'd like you to be a mother.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.800
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.000
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.800
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.900
Great. You forgot.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.600
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.400
So my hints worked.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.500
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.600
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.900
- Hello?
- Chris?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.200
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.800
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.500
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.100
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.500
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.800
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.500
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.900
I've been waiting a week.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.800
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.000
When are you coming home?

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.500
In about two weeks.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.200
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.700
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.600
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.500
OK. OK...

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.400
Who is that? What country are you in?

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.600
Your mobile's been impossible.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.100
I told you. I'm in Greece.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.600
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.300
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.300
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.800
Can you just?

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.400
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.200
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.600
Do you miss me?

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600
OK. Bye, bye.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.900
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.700
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.000
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.000
Sardinia.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.400
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.300
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.200
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.500
You lied to me.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.200
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.700
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.600
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.600
Look, Christ, Christ.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.900
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.200
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.400
I can explain. I... Taxi!

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.800
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.100
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.000
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.600
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.200
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.800
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.800
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.800
You're a liar!

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.600
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:16.500
I only came back
the day before yesterday

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.800
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.600
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:23.700
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.400
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.800
I was about to when you called.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.900
What does that have to do with anything?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.200
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.800
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.900
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.600
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.100
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.800
Well, she has to know eventually.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.100
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200
Nola, stop!

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.500
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.100
We don't have to have a child together.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.000
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.100
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.500
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.200
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.200
Nola, be reasonable.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.300
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.500
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.900
So, you're threatening me?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.600
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:10.500
Were you lying to me?

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.100
All those times we made love,

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.100
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.700
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.700
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.400
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.900
Have you seen Chris?

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:24.900
A minute ago. He went that way.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.100
Chris?

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.000
Chris?

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.000
Chris?

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.500
Where are you, Chris?

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.800
Chris?

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.600
Chloe, are you there?

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:52.200
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.500
No. Could you come up for a minute?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.200
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.800
Yeah, OK.

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.300
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.100
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.200
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.300
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.300
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.300
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.200
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.000
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.600
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.700
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.300
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.400
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.000
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.200
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.500
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.600
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:09.900
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.500
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.100
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.300
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.800
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.100
Did you hate it?

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.800
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.800
I thought you were gonna pass out.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.100
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.400
I still can't do it with you tonight.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.900
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.100
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.300
No. What are you doing?

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.100
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.100
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:54.000
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.800
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.700
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.900
Is this it?

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.500
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.500
I've got to have words
with her about it.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.200
It's really...

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.000
What did you just put in your pocket?

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:14.700
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.100
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.900
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.500
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.200
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.500
- Guess what?
- What?

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.900
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
You haven't. That's not like you.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:30.300
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.200
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.000
No, that's not so.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.500
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.500
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:42.900
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.700
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.400
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:51.500
You're so sweet.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.000
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.900
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.700
OK, I will.

01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:07.400
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.900
When you get off work today,
come right home.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I have some good news.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.400
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.400
You've got to meet me
right after work.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.100
We have... plans to make.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.400
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.200
It's good. This is good.

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:31.100
I'll see you soon. Bye.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.500
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.100
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.400
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.600
Yes.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.300
A half year should do it, maybe less.

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.000
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.100
Good.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.400
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.500
for developing their capacity.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.100
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.500
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:32.200
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.900
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.200
We met here last...

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.700
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.800
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.400
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.000
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.100
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.100
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.600
Well, what's the trouble?

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.500
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:03.500
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.000
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.100
Yes.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.200
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.400
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.600
I have to take my medicine.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:39.600
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.600
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.000
Mrs. Eastby?

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.200
It's lan.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.200
Mrs. Eastby?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.200
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.000
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.000
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.800
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.600
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.700
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800
Excellent.

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.200
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.100
Nola.

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:57.900
Excuse me.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.900
Hello.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.900
Where are you?

01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.700
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.800
- Good evening.
- Hello.

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.900
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.500
Two pounds.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:22.700
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.800
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.900
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.300
As he, or they, were running out

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.800
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.200
Either out of panic,

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.300
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.000
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.300
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.700
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.100
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.500
Probably cased her.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.000
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.100
She picked the wrong time to come home.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.800
Some people just don't have any luck.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:57.800
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.700
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.400
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.700
Do you need anything from the car?

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.800
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.100
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.100
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.900
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.300
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:16.100
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.900
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.700
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.700
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.500
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.700
No, hang on. If you just wait.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.100
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.500
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.500
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.500
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.800
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.100
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.000
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.500
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.900
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.200
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.500
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.500
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.600
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.100
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.500
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.900
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.700
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:10.900
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.900
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.200
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.200
Did you like the musical last night?

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:24.900
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.300
Yeah, he's very good.

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.000
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.100
Good.

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:38.400
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.700
Oh, my God! Nola!

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:45.500
- Nola Rice.
- What?

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.500
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:53.200
What? Here, let me see that.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.000
Jesus Christ!

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:05.100
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.700
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.700
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.100
Oh, my God.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.200
Hello?

01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.800
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.400
Isn't itjust terrible?

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.800
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.900
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.200
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.500
I know.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.100
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.900
Hello?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.500
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.400
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:48.800
I suppose she must've...

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.600
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.900
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.700
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.000
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.300
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.300
over the past year.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.000
Did you hear that? Yeah.

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.400
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.200
Mummy.

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:22.300
I've got something to tell you.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.400
But I want Chris to be here.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.600
Chris?

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:30.600
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:32.700
He was just in here. Chris?

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400
Chris?

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:44.100
He was just here.

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:45.800
Well, what did you want to tell me?

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.300
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.800
Where are you? Chris?

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.600
Well, what did you want to tell me?

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.400
Well, I just really want him to be here.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.800
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.400
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.800
Well, I wanted you to be here.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.400
Well, what is it?

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.900
Mummy...

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.800
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.600
It looks like I'm pregnant.

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.900
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.800
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:50.900
Alec?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.700
Alec? Come here.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:56.300
We're both walking on air.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.500
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:01.500
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.800
Chloe's pregnant.

01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:05.400
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:07.800
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:09.500
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:10.600
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.200
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.600
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:18.500
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.000
Thank you, Margaret.

01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.400
Sam?

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:25.000
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.000
Detective Mike Banner, called.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:30.200
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.700
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.800
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.200
I bet it was that night...

01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:40.600
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.500
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.800
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:52.700
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:55.300
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.600
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.900
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.800
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.600
Detective Banner, please.

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.700
This is Chris Wilton.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400
Oh, hello.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:17.900
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.900
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.200
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:26.700
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:30.000
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.100
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.200
I certainly hope not.

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.300
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.400
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:52.300
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.400
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.800
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:03.200
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.000
How?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.200
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:11.000
That's...

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.800
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:18.900
They broke up. A year ago. More.

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400
When did you last see her?

01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.600
Oh, God, I can't remember.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.300
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:34.800
But that was a long time ago.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.300
Have you seen her since?

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:40.500
Not that I recall.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.900
Have?

01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:47.500
Have you ever seen this?

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:50.500
No. What is it?

01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.400
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.600
No.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.600
As you can see...

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.600
...you're all over it.

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.200
Yes, I can see that.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.600
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.200
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:35.800
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.800
But you people have to protect me here.

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.600
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.600
How long did your affair go on?

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.700
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.700
They broke up, she moved away.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:00.500
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.900
God, have a heart.

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:08.100
My wife is gonna have a baby.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.600
This will devastate her.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:13.200
Did you...

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.500
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.000
No, I did not.

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:22.700
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.900
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.200
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.500
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.700
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:44.300
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:48.100
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:52.700
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.900
But you did lead her on,

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:57.700
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.700
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:03.500
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:09.900
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.300
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.500
much less Nola Rice.

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:23.800
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.900
and she walked in when it was happening?

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.300
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.700
...wreck people's lives.

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:36.800
My family, my marriage is at stake.

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:40.500
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.000
OK, but I'm not your man.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:46.700
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.100
but that does not make me a murderer.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.100
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:54.200
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:55.900
And if we have to talk to you again,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.300
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.900
Your personal life's your own.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.800
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.100
I understand.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.700
Look...

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:20.900
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:25.100
please call me on my mobile.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:27.500
This is my number.

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.000
Thanks.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:32.700
One other thing.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:35.200
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.800
Me?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.200
No.

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:44.200
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.400
You can check it out, but...

01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.400
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.500
Of course.

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.500
Thank you.

01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.100
So, what do you think?

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.500
I think it's what it looks like.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.600
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:17.200
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:21.800
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:23.900
He's 'specting a baby.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:26.500
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.300
...we can find out discreetly enough

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.300
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.300
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.200
never mind sawing one off.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.000
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:46.800
Not even a speeding ticket.

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.700
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:52.100
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:54.400
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:55.900
Well, come on, Mike.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.900
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.100
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.500
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:05.500
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:10.200
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.300
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.200
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:18.700
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.000
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.800
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.300
Chris.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.000
Nola...

01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.300
...it wasn't easy.

01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:43.100
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.900
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:53.700
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.700
You have to.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.300
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.500
And what about me?

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:04.300
What about the next-door neighbor?

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.100
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:14.500
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.800
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:25.100
You were collateral damage.

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:27.700
So was your own child.

01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:33.900
Sophocles said:

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.600
"To never have been born

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.700
may be the greatest boon of all."

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.300
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.400
Your actions were clumsy.

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.200
Full of holes.

01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:53.500
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.900
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.900
and punished.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.700
At least there would be
some small sign ofjustice.

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.800
Some small...

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.900
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:19.500
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.300
What?

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.100
It's as we speculated

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.600
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:29.700
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:31.500
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.600
He waited in the hall.

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.500
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.900
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.100
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.400
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:45.000
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.600
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.800
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:50.700
and I am going to break this case.

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:52.600
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:53.600
What?

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:55.700
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:57.000
What's the bad news?

01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.900
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.700
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.100
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:07.800
No, he didn't have to.

01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:11.100
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.000
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.200
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:21.600
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:23.900
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:26.700
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:29.300
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:31.200
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:33.600
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.100
No, wait.

01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:39.100
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.900
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.700
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:48.600
Come on.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.200
I give up.

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:53.100
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.500
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:58.900
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.400
What a world. Am I right?

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:05.800
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:08.900
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.900
Right. Champagne.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.200
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:15.700
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:19.000
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:21.900
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.600
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:28.200
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.600
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:32.200
Let's work on number two. Come on.

02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:35.600
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.900
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.100
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:40.500
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.100
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:44.300
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:45.300
Please do.

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:46.500
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:48.800
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.300
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.100
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:55.700
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.700
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.100
I just hope that he's lucky.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.800
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:02.200
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:04.100
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.100
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.500
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.900
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.100
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:15.700
What are you saying about him?

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:17.700
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.800
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.100
I wonder what he's thinking.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.500
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.200
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:28.200
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.000
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
