01:06.867 --> 01:08.951
This is a routine pursuit.

01:09.035 --> 01:12.997
Main Force repeats, this is
a routine pursuit. Code 44.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.165
Listen, you tell them we need help.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.501
This should be an open-code blitz
and you know it.

01:17.586 --> 01:19.236
You have your information.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.330
Come on, sweetheart,
this one's a heavyweight!

01:21.415 --> 01:23.374
Main Force repeats,
you have your information.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.417
Okay.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.670
This is a routine pursuit.
Please liaise with Big Bopper.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.757
March Hare to Big Bopper.
Assist on Code 3 Red Alert.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.260
March Hare to Big Bopper.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.762
Big Bopper. Got you, Hare.
What's going down?

01:36.847 --> 01:39.640
- We've got a cop-killer.
- You're kidding!

01:42.075 --> 01:43.242
Be warned, Sarse,

01:43.326 --> 01:44.618
this is non-compliance.

01:44.703 --> 01:47.037
The Main Force will not tolerate
such action.

01:50.125 --> 01:53.240
This pursuit is designated
a standard Code 44.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.513
Please respond only to that code.

01:55.597 --> 01:58.850
Code 44 indicates no requirement
for a blockade.

01:59.268 --> 02:01.144
A Pursuit Special has been stolen.

02:01.229 --> 02:05.148
Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee
doesn't like this any more than you.

02:05.199 --> 02:07.835
However, we must not compromise
territorial range.

02:08.245 --> 02:11.157
Remember that
only by following instructions

02:11.248 --> 02:14.425
can we hope to maintain
a successful highway program.

02:14.852 --> 02:17.720
Jesus, March Hare to Big Bopper.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.556
We're around three minutes
off the intersection. Can you make it?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.892
- We'll make it! Move over!
- No room!

02:22.976 --> 02:24.185
I'm driving!

02:24.770 --> 02:27.063
Not this again! I've been assigned!

02:29.024 --> 02:33.027
Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate!
Darn you.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.072
Go on.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.909
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.661
A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.622
A few hours ago, down in Sun City,
he goes berserk.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.417
Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie
and takes off in a Pursuit Special.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.461
We've been on him ever since.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.380
This one's right up the air, Roop.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.965
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.974
What's he driving?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.435
That's what hurts.
It's one of our V8s.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.146
Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!

03:17.656 --> 03:20.950
Okay, we're about half a mile off Anarchie
Road. You'll see him any minute now.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.457
Rip the guts out of it.
Give it the bejesus!

03:33.714 --> 03:35.005
See him yet?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.424
Got it!

03:38.135 --> 03:40.136
I'm gonna blow him away!

03:41.012 --> 03:42.847
I'm gonna ram him!

04:03.952 --> 04:05.828
Hey, fellas, you okay?

04:06.538 --> 04:09.540
Acknowledge,
Big Bopper, acknowledge. Are you okay?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.042
Roop, Charlie.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.503
Do you see me, Toecutter?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.839
Do you see me, man?

04:19.634 --> 04:22.720
Keep going, we're okay.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.347
We got you, we're going.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.979
Born with a steering wheel in his hand

04:32.063 --> 04:33.856
and lead in his foot.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.233
He is the Nightrider

04:37.110 --> 04:40.488
cruising at the speed of fright!

04:41.615 --> 04:46.118
This is the Nightrider,
and we ain't never coming back!

04:48.330 --> 04:52.166
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!

04:52.626 --> 04:55.961
I am a rocker! I am a roller!

04:57.297 --> 04:58.964
I think we're still mobile.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.091
For Christ's sake, shove over!

05:01.218 --> 05:02.968
You're blaspheming again.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.513
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.392
I am the Nightrider!

05:18.360 --> 05:21.654
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.322
Understand this.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.324
That scag and his floozy,

05:26.243 --> 05:27.576
they're gonna die!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.875
Main Force to Gosling One.

05:36.211 --> 05:39.171
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.423
MFP to Gosling One.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.260
Main Force to Gosling One.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.886
It was all slow motion.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.472
He leaves his seat
and goes through the windscreen,

05:48.557 --> 05:50.599
headfirst straight into the tree, right?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.519
And then bounces back
through the windscreen.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.190
By the time we got to him,
he was just sitting there

05:58.275 --> 06:00.943
trying to scream with his face ripped off.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.822
What's the matter?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.323
Not hungry, am I?

06:06.658 --> 06:07.950
Give it here.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.161
- I'll tell you what...
- Look at that.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.290
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.126
Catch you later, Goose.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.489
Christ,
they're heading for population!

07:02.881 --> 07:05.090
What's this I hear
about you and Jonathan?

07:05.175 --> 07:08.052
- What about Jonathan?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.345
So what?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.683
It's this way.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.620
He's gone.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.704
Bastards!

07:37.707 --> 07:38.999
Shit!

07:39.376 --> 07:41.001
We're really gonna get it this time.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.253
- He had his indicator on.
- Shut up!

07:47.550 --> 07:50.719
No, you're not going on.
Stay off the road!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.638
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!

07:52.722 --> 07:54.765
People's lives are in peril!

07:57.018 --> 07:58.686
Stay off the roads!

08:02.774 --> 08:04.650
I'm gonna have him!

08:06.945 --> 08:08.612
Stay off the roads!

08:10.740 --> 08:11.740
Get off the road!

08:11.825 --> 08:14.243
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!

08:25.088 --> 08:26.255
Oh, my God.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.467
Watch out!

08:48.445 --> 08:49.820
I am ready.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.905
I am ready for your best.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.992
Oh, my God, what happened?

08:55.076 --> 08:57.703
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.205
I think he broke his leg.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.374
I want to find out
what's happening.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.751
Max, can you hear me?

09:03.835 --> 09:05.461
Main Force Patrol,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.546
we're out of the game,

09:07.630 --> 09:09.715
unable to continue pursuit.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.552
You'd better send a meat truck.
Charlie's copped a saucer in the throat.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.720
Hey, Max?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.140
Max?

09:18.224 --> 09:19.433
Go ahead.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.352
We are 100 percent SNAFUed.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.604
You okay?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.565
Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.108
Much damage?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.155
You should see
the damage, Bronze!

09:33.656 --> 09:34.740
Metal damage,

09:34.824 --> 09:35.949
brain damage?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.659
You listening, Bronze?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.079
I am the Nightrider!

09:42.499 --> 09:45.876
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.671
I am a rocker! I am a roller!

09:49.839 --> 09:52.674
I am an out-of-controller!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.303
I am the Nightrider, baby,

09:56.888 --> 10:01.100
and it's me and Marmaduke,
and we ain't never coming back.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.869
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.872
I am the Nightrider!

10:30.088 --> 10:34.091
I am the chosen one,
the mighty hand of vengeance

10:34.175 --> 10:37.136
sent down to strike the unroadworthy!

10:38.429 --> 10:40.931
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.767
Step right up, chum, and watch the kid

10:43.852 --> 10:47.437
lay down a rubber road right to freedom!

11:26.769 --> 11:28.478
What's wrong?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.942
- Baby, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.664
It's going...
It's going to...

11:47.874 --> 11:50.792
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.427
Stop!

12:59.529 --> 13:01.488
That feels good.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.075
After three days, that feels so good.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.664
I got a right hook in the mouth
this morning.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.957
Sprog?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.626
I told him to always lead with his left.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.963
You know, I think we've got
a monster on our hands.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.299
Yeah, takes after his old man.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.550
What's that?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.135
Monster!

13:24.637 --> 13:27.306
Montazano,
who called himself the Nightrider,

13:27.390 --> 13:31.018
had broken from custody
and escaped in the police vehicle.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.185
You made the news again.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.813
He was awaiting arraignment on charges
relating to the slaying...

13:34.897 --> 13:36.023
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.026
...of a Main Force Patrol officer
in a road blockade accident last month.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.235
Just another glory rider, I guess.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.864
This was the third episode in
the Sun City sectors in the past 27 days.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.637
Jessie, I told you.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.598
The Goose wants me there early.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.099
What for, he didn't say.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.851
You know the Goose.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.312
Coffee's ready.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.004
I'm not grumpy.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.721
Get out of here.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.142
Okay.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.894
I gotta go.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.168
What's that?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.505
Crazy about you.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.819
All supplies must be
requisitioned from the people's bond.

15:45.903 --> 15:50.866
Please do not exploit your privileges.
Doing so is an offense.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.368
Memorandum Seven:

15:53.536 --> 15:56.788
The Captains of the Hall have
asked that pursuit officers

15:56.873 --> 16:01.209
refrain from using the slang "Bronze"
for the Main Force Patrol.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.795
The word is considered disrespectful

16:03.880 --> 16:07.591
and citizens should be
actively discouraged from its use.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.928
Memorandum Eight:

16:12.305 --> 16:14.973
Hospital vouchers are available again.

16:15.057 --> 16:19.102
MFP personnel may sign on
with the following sector captains.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.565
One, six-three, two-four, one-one-two,

16:23.649 --> 16:26.067
five-seven and two-six.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.779
Kick it in the guts, Barry.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.745
She's the last of the V8s.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.665
You can shut the gate on this one, Max.
It's the duck's guts.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.459
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.919
Sucks nitro.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.420
Phase 4 head.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.964
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.926
- 600 horsepower through the wheel.
- The blower, man.

16:51.010 --> 16:55.138
She's meanness put to music
and the bitch is born to run.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.807
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.653
Okay.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.823
How the hell did you get all this together?

17:15.076 --> 17:16.867
It just happened, Max,
you know?

17:16.953 --> 17:19.788
A piece from here and a piece from there.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.249
- So easy?
- Yeah.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.042
Come on, Max. You've seen it.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.795
You've heard it

17:26.878 --> 17:29.297
and you're still asking questions.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.803
When do we go for a ride?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.349
He loves it.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.560
I think we've got him.

17:41.644 --> 17:42.894
I hope so.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.854
Yeah, we've got him.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.190
Your top pursuit man wants
to quit the road

17:47.275 --> 17:49.943
and we have to seduce him with candy?

17:50.111 --> 17:52.696
People don't believe in heroes anymore.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.491
I know, Macaffee. You want
to give them back their heroes.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.827
You will not try this one on me again.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.829
I do not enjoy wasting money.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.247
Goodbye

18:02.999 --> 18:04.666
and good luck!

18:05.751 --> 18:07.335
Thanks, Labatouche.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.088
You're a real human being.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.825
Get out of my way!

18:38.909 --> 18:40.577
The old meat grinder's humming tonight?

18:40.661 --> 18:44.122
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies
over the high side.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.126
Will you shut up!

18:49.587 --> 18:52.213
The hot mops and the towees.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.799
It's in the food.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.135
Hey, Max, another one for your books, eh?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.470
Have you eaten yet?

18:58.554 --> 19:00.555
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.433
That Code 3 you ran down
a few days ago...

19:03.517 --> 19:05.518
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.103
- Got a problem.
- What's that?

19:07.188 --> 19:09.105
His friends.
Word is they're out to get you.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.399
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.611
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.113
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.573
Come on.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.734
Good afternoon.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.236
Good afternoon.

21:20.821 --> 21:24.365
We're here to meet a friend.
Come in on the train.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.870
Nothing come in on the train
except a couple of crates and a...

21:29.371 --> 21:30.705
coffin.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.333
Our friend.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.212
You'll have to see the agent
and sign the papers.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.548
Where do we find this agent?

21:43.219 --> 21:44.427
Wait.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.986
That must be your friend over there.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.030
They didn't leave much of him.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.325
Must have cut his heart out, eh?

22:10.579 --> 22:12.664
Yes, that's what I meant.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.459
Poor bastard.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.171
The Nightrider.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.550
That is his name.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.136
The Nightrider.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.806
The Nightrider.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.350
Remember him

22:32.685 --> 22:35.103
when you look at the night sky.

22:36.397 --> 22:37.856
I will.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.942
Take your hat off.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.459
Anything you say.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.545
Anything I say.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.591
What a wonderful philosophy you have.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.467
Take him away.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.896
Bubba. Johnny.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.275
Push me, shove you!

24:04.360 --> 24:05.860
Oh, yeah? Says who?

24:06.111 --> 24:08.404
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

24:09.073 --> 24:12.909
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?

24:28.175 --> 24:29.258
Nightrider!

24:31.553 --> 24:33.179
Nightrider!

24:36.392 --> 24:37.517
Nightrider!

25:20.686 --> 25:22.103
No worries.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.634
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.303
Rockatansky.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.389
We have
incident at Wee Jerusalem.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.558
Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.

27:23.851 --> 27:26.227
Okay, we're on it. We gone.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.354
Goose, come on.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.404
What's this?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.906
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.175
- Any more details?
- No.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.511
Okay, we're gone.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.599
- Max, he looks...
- Yeah.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.271
Hey, fella, stop!

28:11.857 --> 28:13.149
Hey, fella!

28:15.819 --> 28:17.320
Hey, fella, stop!

28:19.573 --> 28:21.073
What a turkey!

28:21.992 --> 28:24.827
Hey, fella, you're a turkey, you know that?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.789
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.795
Nightrider. My Niqueur.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.223
Pursuit units
in sectors, eight, nine and ten.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.187
A cyclecade of nomad bikers.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.314
A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.318
Your instructions are to locate.
Do not engage.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.783
Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.956
Bronze!

29:11.250 --> 29:12.750
Gonna get you!

29:14.962 --> 29:16.045
It's okay.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.674
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.259
It's all right.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.427
This one's whacked
right out of his skull.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.680
Whacked right out of his skull, man!

29:25.764 --> 29:27.848
He ain't never coming back.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.821
It's all right.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.783
I'm gonna let this go now.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.872
I know you're frightened, girl,

29:52.249 --> 29:54.917
but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.

29:55.919 --> 29:59.547
My name's Jim Goose,
and everything's gonna be all right.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.438
The Nightrider!

30:15.897 --> 30:17.273
Hey, Jimbo.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.943
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.946
Remember him when you look up...

30:24.948 --> 30:26.282
When you look...

30:27.242 --> 30:28.576
Nightrider!

30:30.620 --> 30:32.955
Well, well, well.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.815
Johnny the Boy has done it again.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.276
This time it's a scrubber.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.029
He's never gonna learn.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.367
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.535
You are going back for him.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.955
No way! Not me, not for him!

31:15.916 --> 31:17.458
But it's not for him.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.710
It's for me, Bubba.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.678
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!

31:29.763 --> 31:32.139
He's nothing like the Nightrider!

31:54.162 --> 31:56.038
Code 7 progress, eight-one.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.998
Code 7 progress, eight-three.

31:58.083 --> 32:01.001
Code 7, eight-six,
eight-one, eight-zero.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.879
MFP Code 1.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.925
Captain Macaffee in convoy from
the courthouse to the Halls of Justice.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.510
Code 1 progress.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.070
Hey, mister.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.322
What happened to the car?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.783
What do you think happened?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.953
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.748
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.168
Hey, Roop.

32:42.878 --> 32:44.170
Stay here, mate.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.222
I think they're out there.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.726
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.728
Good day and good luck.

33:02.731 --> 33:06.192
I can see the Interceptor.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.450
What do you say, Scag?

33:14.576 --> 33:16.535
Got no place special to go?

33:17.329 --> 33:19.163
We'd better prep him.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.999
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?

33:25.212 --> 33:27.213
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?

33:27.297 --> 33:28.672
No contest.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.109
Hey, Fif! What's going on?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.778
- What happened?
- Let him go, Charlie.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.821
What's he mean,
"Let him go"? Who's this?

33:52.906 --> 33:54.490
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?

33:54.574 --> 33:56.075
No one showed, okay?

33:56.243 --> 33:57.701
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.036
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.163
No one showed. No one.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.290
What's he mean, "No one showed"?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.875
They didn't show.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.211
Nobody! The punks didn't show.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.297
The girl didn't show,
the townspeople didn't show.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.049
Nobody showed!

34:12.509 --> 34:14.217
We're screwed! It's the law.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.137
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?

34:17.222 --> 34:20.056
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.
No contest.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.226
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna
let him walk out the door, Fifi?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.396
That's exactly what you're going to do!

34:25.480 --> 34:27.856
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie!

34:28.775 --> 34:30.067
It's all right.

34:30.150 --> 34:34.112
Hey, Bronze, look at you,
a cripple and a mute!

34:34.197 --> 34:37.241
Scag, he sings and I tap dance!

34:38.493 --> 34:40.786
Hey, you know that you're wrong!

34:40.911 --> 34:44.748
The courts will hear about this.
I promise they'll hear about this disgrace.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.418
He wearing that face for a bet
or does he really look that stupid?

34:48.503 --> 34:50.420
This man is grossly offensive!

34:50.505 --> 34:51.964
Get him out of here, Max!

34:52.047 --> 34:54.757
- I can make a case of it!
- What case, you fool?

34:54.842 --> 34:56.760
You saw what they did to that girl!

34:56.844 --> 34:59.263
For God's sake, she was the town bike!

35:02.225 --> 35:05.102
He's my prisoner,
and he's not walking out that door!

35:05.186 --> 35:07.563
- Get him out of here!
- Who is this guy?

35:07.647 --> 35:09.607
Goose, settle down, boy.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.403
Jesus, Fifi.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.030
Fifi, Jesus.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.157
Look, they're laughing at us!

35:18.241 --> 35:21.869
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
They don't believe us!

35:24.372 --> 35:26.165
See you later, Goose.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.667
It's been a pleasure.

35:55.779 --> 35:59.239
Skiffington, go home. Go.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.116
Goose!

36:01.576 --> 36:03.577
You can't do anything about it!

36:03.662 --> 36:06.038
We know who you are, Bronze!

36:06.122 --> 36:08.082
We'll see you on the road, Scag!

36:08.166 --> 36:10.876
See you on the road
like we saw the Nightrider!

36:11.169 --> 36:15.422
We remember the Nightrider,
and we know who you are!

36:22.389 --> 36:23.389
Okay.

36:24.224 --> 36:28.769
So long as the paperwork is clean,
you boys can do what you like out there.

36:31.022 --> 36:35.442
Hey, here he is, the walking armpit!

36:46.079 --> 36:49.206
There's a fire in my belly,
and she's the woman to put it out.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.459
Off, brute!
This angel is hot in the tubes for me!

36:57.674 --> 36:59.758
I'm on fire, I'm on fire!

36:59.968 --> 37:01.969
Joviality is a game of children.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.721
She's mine.

37:03.805 --> 37:06.014
I should have been a surgeon
with these hands.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.896
Mudguts, get out of there!

37:15.400 --> 37:18.235
Cundalini, put her against the post.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.410
We have a problem here.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.038
She is not what she seems.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.834
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority

37:34.377 --> 37:37.838
she's sent by the Bronze,
full of treachery.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.846
The Bronze take our pride.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.986
If you're gonna waste the Bronze,
you gotta do it big!

38:01.362 --> 38:05.032
You just don't have the style,
do you, chicken shit?

38:07.494 --> 38:10.204
Goes to water on a dummy.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.303
It's all right. It's okay.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.391
Just remember

38:32.393 --> 38:36.355
to keep your sweet, sweet mouth

38:36.439 --> 38:38.440
shut!

39:15.728 --> 39:17.938
MFP to Gosling One.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.066
Main Force Patrol to Gosling One.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.820
We have a curfew violation.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.572
MFP, Gosling One.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.156
Gosling One.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.284
Code 333 in progress.

39:30.368 --> 39:34.413
Main Force.
Would someone inform the Goose...

40:08.656 --> 40:10.365
Yeah, baby!

40:12.118 --> 40:14.077
All units again progress.

40:15.997 --> 40:16.997
All units again progress.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.983
...units to Three Day Angel Patrol.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.235
Nice to have you back, Big Bopper Two.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.489
Sun City Sector 3,
Code 4 Trauma in progress.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.034
Sun City Sector 9, Code 4 in progress.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.354
MFP eight-one.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.231
A memorandum:

43:29.482 --> 43:31.024
For the cannibalization...

43:31.109 --> 43:32.609
MFP, copy.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.988
Hey, it's the Goose.

43:43.704 --> 43:47.374
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.751
Hey, Midge,

43:50.336 --> 43:54.381
don't write off the Goose
until you see the box going into the hole.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.843
Yeah, well, don't wreck my truck now.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.929
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.723
Hey, you sure you're all right?

44:03.850 --> 44:06.059
Couldn't be righter.

44:06.978 --> 44:11.398
Jimmy the Goose,
larger than life and twice as ugly!

45:33.814 --> 45:35.482
Light me, Johnny.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.129
Light another.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.930
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.

46:07.056 --> 46:09.516
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.434
Light it!

46:16.857 --> 46:20.568
The Bronze,
they keep you from being proud.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.698
Look at him. He looks silly,
doesn't he, upside down?

46:27.034 --> 46:29.911
- Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!
- I can't.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.705
- Throw it.
- No!

46:32.248 --> 46:34.708
You scum-sucking trash!

46:34.792 --> 46:36.042
Throw it!

46:36.711 --> 46:39.462
I can't stand the pain!

47:12.038 --> 47:13.705
Max.

48:10.930 --> 48:13.139
Max! Hey, Max!

48:14.266 --> 48:18.812
That thing in there, that's not the Goose.
No way.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.588
I was hungry.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.425
Peanut butter and honey.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.860
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.782
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.161
Now there's nothing.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.625
Here I am, trying to put sense to it

50:04.418 --> 50:06.586
when I know there isn't any.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.927
I'll be all right,
once I get it clear in my head.

50:37.076 --> 50:38.076
Fifi.

50:43.958 --> 50:45.959
- What's this?
- I'm through.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.127
- Again?
- No, not again.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.630
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.

50:50.714 --> 50:54.634
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.594
Now, just a minute!

50:58.097 --> 50:59.931
All right, so the Goose bought it.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.891
That's the way he always
came at the world.

51:01.976 --> 51:03.226
Off beat.

51:03.477 --> 51:06.521
Max, you'd be the first to admit
it was long overdue.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.774
All right, I'll tell you how it is.

51:09.858 --> 51:11.609
You're a winner, Max.

51:11.694 --> 51:13.486
You're on the top shelf

51:13.696 --> 51:17.865
and I'm not gonna lose you because
of some crazy notion about quitting!

51:19.785 --> 51:23.329
They say people don't believe
in heroes anymore.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.707
Well, damn them!

51:25.791 --> 51:27.667
You and me, Max,

51:28.752 --> 51:31.421
we're gonna give them back their heroes.

51:32.506 --> 51:35.425
Do you really expect me
to go for that crap?

51:35.718 --> 51:38.886
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute?

51:39.305 --> 51:40.388
Bye, Fifi.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.808
Come on, do you want me to beg?

51:44.518 --> 51:47.103
Do you want me on my knees, crying?

51:47.521 --> 51:49.314
Now just a minute.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.316
Give me a reason.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.696
I'm scared, Fif.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.867
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.619
I'm beginning to enjoy it.

52:02.703 --> 52:04.245
What is this, funny week?

52:04.330 --> 52:07.332
Any longer out on that road,
and I'm one of them, you know?

52:07.416 --> 52:09.042
A terminal crazy.

52:09.668 --> 52:12.795
Only I've got a bronze badge
to say I'm one of the good guys.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.214
You know what I'm trying to say?

52:16.091 --> 52:18.217
I'll tell you what I'll do.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.557
Take off a few weeks.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.477
Grow yourself a beard.

52:27.936 --> 52:30.605
Draw flies.
Just think about it for a while.

52:31.190 --> 52:34.525
If you still feel the same way
when you come back, it's okay by me.

52:34.610 --> 52:35.818
Go on.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.284
I'm not gonna change my mind.

52:43.369 --> 52:46.537
Get out of here
before I decide to come with you.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.916
Bye, Fif. Thank you.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.880
You'll be back, Rockatansky!

52:56.840 --> 52:58.466
You're hooked, Max.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.927
And you know it!

54:06.201 --> 54:10.747
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.793
Guess I always
counted on you understanding.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.344
When I was a kid,

54:25.846 --> 54:30.266
me and my father
used to go for long walks.

54:32.561 --> 54:34.896
I remember staring down at his shoes.

54:36.398 --> 54:39.567
They were special shoes, brown.

54:40.486 --> 54:42.987
And he always kept them really shiny.

54:45.532 --> 54:49.994
He was tall,
and he used to take long strides.

54:51.246 --> 54:53.873
And there I'd be right alongside him

54:54.208 --> 54:56.417
just trying to keep up with him.

55:00.380 --> 55:04.467
I don't think he ever knew
how proud I felt of him.

55:06.929 --> 55:09.931
Or how good it felt
just to be there alongside him.

55:12.976 --> 55:16.020
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel...

55:20.400 --> 55:22.443
The thing is, Jess,

55:23.904 --> 55:27.907
I couldn't tell him about it then,
but I can tell you about it now.

55:31.662 --> 55:35.915
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you
how I'm feeling about you right now.

56:02.442 --> 56:03.442
Hello.

56:03.527 --> 56:04.694
Get a load of that!

56:04.778 --> 56:06.362
We had a blowout a while back.

56:06.446 --> 56:08.322
Raunchy, very raunchy.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.032
What's the donk like?

56:10.117 --> 56:12.702
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire...

56:12.786 --> 56:16.497
Don't do much work on these myself,
except to scrape them off the road.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.958
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire?

56:19.042 --> 56:20.418
Have it fixed in no time.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.295
I can sell you a set of 'lops
for next to nothing.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.379
No, thanks.

56:23.463 --> 56:26.757
I can't remember where I got them,
but I got them, know what I mean?

56:26.842 --> 56:30.219
No, we'll be all right
just as soon as we get this fixed.

56:30.304 --> 56:31.846
- Max?
- Yeah?

56:33.140 --> 56:34.181
Listen,

56:35.183 --> 56:38.519
Sproggo's talked me
into buying him an ice cream, so,

56:38.645 --> 56:40.479
I think I'll see you later.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.482
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.735
They'll appreciate the business.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.445
Sure, thanks.

56:47.988 --> 56:49.155
Toodlepip.

57:03.587 --> 57:05.296
- You just trucking around?
- Yeah.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.923
Good time for just trucking.

57:07.007 --> 57:09.967
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?

57:10.052 --> 57:11.135
Maybe.

57:41.541 --> 57:44.043
Look what's turned up
for Sunday dinner.

57:45.045 --> 57:47.713
Main course and dessert.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.216
My favorite kind:

57:51.176 --> 57:52.385
Female.

58:31.967 --> 58:33.884
Watch the tongue, lovable.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.595
I've seen him lick
his own eyebrow clean.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.880
Must've spent some coin.

59:10.964 --> 59:14.341
Like the sign says,
speed's just a question of money.

59:14.468 --> 59:16.469
How fast do you wanna go?

59:16.678 --> 59:18.637
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?

59:18.722 --> 59:20.598
Just take my word for it, get in!

59:20.682 --> 59:23.309
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!

59:25.562 --> 59:26.937
Your tire, man.

59:27.856 --> 59:29.356
Hey, fella, what about your tire?

59:34.196 --> 59:35.821
Crazy people!

59:37.240 --> 59:39.492
The world's full of crazy people.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.219
That wagon, was it here?

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.096
- Sure, a couple with a kid.
- Who are...

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.555
I was just fixing their tire.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.934
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.521
Who are they?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:12.191
A couple, passing through.
Said they were heading north. Maybe.

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.831
You want to drive the car? Yeah?

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:30.042
Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore.
Into the back.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.585
Here you go.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:37.299
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.

01:00:37.384 --> 01:00:40.386
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.139
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.521
What's the matter with you?

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.985
What you got there, mate?

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.573
Max!

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:08.914
Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.129
Sure. It's been nice talking to you. Bye.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.507
Take it you agreed with him.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.509
They're not worried, I'm not worried.

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.136
What about that?

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.014
I figure it's lost property.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:28.559
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:32.354
Sounds okay to me, Jess.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:33.772
Don't know.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.775
If Ziggy says so,
believe me, it's okay.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.112
May's expecting you
up at the farm sometime.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.824
You'll have no trouble up there.
Just green grass.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.109
How are you doing?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.237
I'm getting there.

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:32.039
I reckon you ought to connect
the doohickey to the gizmo.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.168
Come here, you.

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:40.130
You touch me with those hands
and I'll rip you apart. No!

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.132
Look at them! No!

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:05.698
May told me about the little beach
down by the trees. Do you want to come?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.366
Love to.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:11.870
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt,
or we're never gonna get out of here.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.623
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.874
Do that.

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:50.409
Jessie.

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:54.830
If you meet Benno down there,
don't let him trouble you.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.582
He's only a baby.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.084
Sure, May.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.230
- The men.
- What men? Come on.

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:51.233
Now you calm down
and you tell me what's the matter.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.110
Very, very naughty.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:56.238
- Now, you tell May what you...
- May.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.366
May, you call The Dark One.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.786
And you tell him
to get here as fast as he can.

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.329
Why? What's going on?

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.749
I think we've got some hoon trouble.
It's gonna be all right.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:12.629
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:29.062
You've had an awful time, darling.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:32.649
But it's all over now.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:35.944
Everything's going to be all right.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.743
I've just got to go and make a phone call

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.872
and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:08.518
The Dark One, and hurry it up,
will you?

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.687
It's May Swaisey.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.238
Sprog? Oh, no!

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.780
Sprog!

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:07.661
Well, well, well.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.997
It's our little mother.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.462
That there is Cundalini

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:21.133
and Cundalini wants his hand back.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.469
I want my baby.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.138
Tell you what,

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.474
I'll swap you.

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.602
Please, give me my baby.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:33.979
Jessie.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:37.149
Jessie, Jessie.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.110
You've not got a sense of humor.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.031
You've got a pretty face, though.
Awful pretty.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.659
Awful pretty.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:52.164
I suppose you don't need a sense of humor
with a pretty face.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.834
The only trouble is though, missy,

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.419
if you should

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.547
lose the face...

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.466
Please, don't hurt my baby.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.092
You've got nothing!

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:06.011
What do you want from me?

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:09.848
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.142
Right there!

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:16.563
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:17.773
Stand back!

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.275
- Stay back!
- Woman!

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.610
Stay back!

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:33.747
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:35.957
Open that door.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.918
Every one of you, in there.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:42.589
Put the babe on the ground.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.677
Jessie, get the van.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:30.262
Don't stop. Just go right through it.

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:55.203
Now what?

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.213
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:07.424
I don't know, it just died on me.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.552
Get out. Run!

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:58.475
Jessie!

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.352
Where?

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:04.064
Lord, have mercy!

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.611
What do you reckon?

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.822
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.532
This your subdural?

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.909
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.663
Multiple traumas, spleen,
liver, lung, flail chest,

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:04.541
left neck of femur, renal shutdown.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.002
Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable?

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:10.005
Yeah, sure,
we got all her signs back last night.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:11.881
- Relatives?
- The husband.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:13.967
They lost the kid. DOA.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.181
Listen, tell him she's
going to be all right.

01:15:17.381 --> 01:15:19.125
Tell him not to worry.

01:15:19.425 --> 01:15:20.932
If he wants, I'll talk to him.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:24.102
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.105
He's been standing there
like a zombie all day.

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:32.295
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:35.256
You come for the grunt?

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:38.218
She won't be ready until this afternoon.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.762
Still having trouble with the front forks.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:43.014
They're mongrels to work with.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:46.851
You asshole!

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.937
What the molly fuck
you think you're doing?

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:52.482
You and me are gonna talk
about the Toecutter.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.567
Never heard of him.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.403
What the Christ are you?

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.614
I wanna know about the tattoo.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.574
I mind my own business, don't I?

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:04.119
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:22.011
I'll say the names,
and you say "yes" or "no."

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.931
Nightrider,

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:29.310
- Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:30.812
There's more?

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:33.022
- Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.817
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.987
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.530
Are they coming back?

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:43.241
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:44.826
- What time?
- For Christ's sake!

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.661
- What time?
- I don't know.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.795
Code unspecified.

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:09.340
We have a query
locate on a black Pursuit Special.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.593
Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:17.974
This is designated as a potential
Code 3 Red Alert.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:13.654
Quit toying, Bubba.

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:17.074
Easy. I know what I'm doing.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.173
Hi.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:47.511
This isn't what it looks, man.

01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:50.681
I just came down here
to check it out,

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:53.684
and this guy, he's already snuffed it.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.978
Nothing you could do for him.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:58.689
Ankle.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:01.525
It's okay.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.032
What are you doing, man?

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:22.671
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do
with anything going on back there, man.

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:26.926
Listen, man, will you?
Listen, will you listen to me?

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:30.262
There were a hell of a lot of
crazy people back there, man.

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:34.391
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:39.230
What are you doing, man?

01:28:40.857 --> 01:28:43.901
What did you say? What are you doing?

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.989
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:51.116
I'm sick, see? Sick.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.410
What do you call it?

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:56.755
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.

01:28:56.881 --> 01:28:59.269
The judge, man, he said so.

01:29:00.269 --> 01:29:01.568
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.258
Jesus! You can't kill me!

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:10.511
Not for stealing a man's boots!

01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:14.181
He was dead, for Christ's sake!

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.602
He won't need them anymore.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.647
What are you doing?

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:25.943
I wanna know what you're doing.

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:35.286
The chain in those handcuffs
is high-tensile steel.

01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:40.624
It'd take you ten minutes
to hack through it with this.

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:44.837
Now, if you're lucky,

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:48.173
you could hack through your ankle
in five minutes.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:49.258
Go.

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.595
You're mad, man!

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:55.890
You think I look silly, don't you?

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:58.684
Don't bring this on me, man.

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:01.395
Don't do this to me, please!

01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:04.674
Sweet Jesus. I was sick!

01:30:05.185 --> 01:30:08.073
Don't bring this on me, please!

01:30:09.305 --> 01:30:15.256
