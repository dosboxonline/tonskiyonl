00:37.203 --> 00:40.915
Christos, this is like the
third message I've left for you

00:40.999 --> 00:43.460
and you're ignoring me, obviously.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.670
I thought you were gonna be here.

00:45.753 --> 00:47.755
That we could like say
goodbye to each other

00:47.839 --> 00:49.674
like civilized human beings.

00:49.757 --> 00:53.928
But obviously you're not up for that, so...

00:54.012 --> 00:57.557
So you know what? Fuck you, Christos.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.475
Fuck you.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.568
You have a nose for American chick.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.154
Come on, that girl looks insane.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.155
Go talk to her, man.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.406
No, I'm working.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.034
Come on, I know your playlist inside out.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.829
It's the same R&B shit and
then later on a bit of disco.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.373
It's not R&B and it's not disco!

02:03.456 --> 02:06.167
This song is 20 fucking
minutes long, come on!

02:06.251 --> 02:07.210
Hey!

02:07.293 --> 02:08.128
Fuck!

02:21.182 --> 02:22.225
Ow!

02:22.308 --> 02:23.893
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
So, listen, guys.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.690
You're an American, you're an American.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.192
You're a man, you're a woman.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.652
There you go.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.530
- Oh, you fuck! Argyris!
- Who the fuck is that guy?

02:35.613 --> 02:37.949
Argyris. You know him?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.951
- No.
- He's an asshole.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.919
You guys are doing it, yeah!

02:54.132 --> 02:56.634
You wanna get out of here?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.094
- Yeah.
- Come on.

02:58.970 --> 02:59.804
Come on.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.662
Good morning!

03:24.955 --> 03:26.832
- We have children here!
- Alright madam, return to your towel.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.168
Can I get you a coffee or something?

03:29.668 --> 03:30.794
What's all that?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.129
Get dressed already.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.214
We have small kids here.
Please do something!

03:34.298 --> 03:35.841
Return to your towel madam!

03:35.924 --> 03:37.551
That's what we're here for.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.678
Get dressed, let's go.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.308
Oh they're hammered.
Handcuffs and off we go.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.445
Hi, I'm Mickey.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.448
Chloe.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.076
Nice to meet you.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.171
Come.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.297
Come, come, come.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.425
Welcome guys!

04:19.635 --> 04:21.303
- Good afternoon Commissioner
- What have we got here?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.222
We caught them stark naked on the beach.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.891
And what you want me
to do? Get them dressed?

04:26.850 --> 04:30.395
- We got them dressed already
- Take the cuffs off!

04:31.813 --> 04:32.770
Do you have IDs? Passports?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.983
- Yeah, yeah.
- Passport? ID?

04:35.066 --> 04:37.819
Oh shit, my bag, I lost my bag.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.529
We...

04:40.531 --> 04:41.570
Americano's!

04:41.573 --> 04:42.991
We're Americans.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.451
Which basketball team you support?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.288
The Cavaliers.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.831
There you go. You?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.292
Milwaukee.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.544
- Ah, Greek Freak.
- Greek, yeah!

04:54.627 --> 04:55.587
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.794
Get them to sign and send them off.

04:57.797 --> 04:58.756
- Mister.
- Yeah.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.098
- Clothes, eh?
- Right.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.808
- Beach, clothes.
- Yes.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.767
Yes, of course.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.352
Home, no clothes.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.941
Where are you going?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.194
I've gotta find my way back
to that house to get my bag.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.445
I'll come with you.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.529
I gotta get my bike.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.656
Okay.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.163
You're going back to the beach, right?

05:30.246 --> 05:31.331
Smoke.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.707
Hey, come on, please.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.917
Smoking is bad for you.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.169
Just one ride.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.299
Come, come, I'll take you.

05:37.346 --> 05:38.255
For fucks sake...

05:41.382 --> 05:42.383
Thank you.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.684
Thank you so much.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.894
Jesus!

05:52.977 --> 05:54.145
Hope everyone's alive.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.406
Is it locked?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.324
Yeah.

06:08.076 --> 06:08.910
Hello!

06:12.163 --> 06:14.249
- I don't think he's here.
- Hello.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.333
Well, who are you calling?

06:15.416 --> 06:16.584
- Argyris.
- Who?

06:16.668 --> 06:18.086
The guy who introduced us.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.045
Asshole.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.092
Yeah, this is his grandmother's house.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.009
Or one of them.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.847
All right.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.306
Shit!

06:30.390 --> 06:31.891
Come on, we've gotta go back to the town.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.643
No, I've gotta wait for my bag, I need it.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.812
No, no, no, we'll call him later, let's go.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.771
I'll take you back.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.106
You'll take me to my house?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.732
I'll take you anywhere you want.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.077
Just here.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.747
Oh, thank you so much.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.332
Wow, very nice.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.249
Yeah.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.507
Thank you.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.926
Thanks for taking me home,
I really appreciate it.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.260
Sure, absolutely.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.013
It's been nice.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.973
Yeah, it was really nice to meet you.

07:54.057 --> 07:54.891
Mickey.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.476
I know.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.519
- Chloe.
- Chloe.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.940
What are you doing tonight?

08:02.982 --> 08:03.900
I'm packing.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.361
I go back to the States tomorrow.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.279
Really? For how long?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.906
For ever.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.116
I've had enough of Greece.

08:13.284 --> 08:17.914
Well, if you wanna have a proper goodbye,

08:17.997 --> 08:21.167
I'm deejaying on this island tonight.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.044
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.964
I think I should probably
just get ready to go.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.883
I'm gonna go, okay?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.261
Thank you, and thank you
for not being an asshole.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.304
It's like a new thing for me.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.099
Try not to be an asshole, yes.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.476
Okay, I'd better go.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.068
You don't have your keys, right?

08:47.152 --> 08:48.153
They're in the bag?

08:49.821 --> 08:50.655
Yeah.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.368
But one of the neighbors, I mean, though.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.506
You wanna go to an island?

09:10.467 --> 09:11.301
Come on in.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.179
Well.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.266
Sorry, it's a bit of a mess in here.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.476
It's nice.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.353
Well, yeah, I mean...

09:25.356 --> 09:26.191
Kypseli.

09:27.859 --> 09:31.070
It's your friend, Argyris the asshole.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.032
Yeah, he is an asshole,
but he's got a big heart.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.826
Do you just have pictures
of him or is this his place?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.621
Well, it's his
grandmother's, but she's dead.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.164
But she was loaded.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.126
Alright, if we're quick,
we can catch our ferry.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.962
I need to take a shower
or wash or something.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.215
Do you? Do you need to take a shower?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.758
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.927
Please. And have you got
something I could put on?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.637
I can't wear this any more.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.971
Yeah, yeah, here.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.848
- Oh.
- There's that.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.141
And then...

10:00.225 --> 10:01.643
Okay.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.144
- Thank you.
- It's good.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.646
- And a towel.
- Right.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.150
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.360
Okay. It's in here?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.695
No, no, it's right here, actually.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.989
- Thank you.
- It's my roommate's room.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.282
Okay, great, thanks.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.492
Yeah.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.410
Think you're gonna be alright or...

10:23.289 --> 10:24.123
Sand.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.417
I think I'll be fine.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.255
- Okay.
- Okay? See you later.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.304
Hey, Mickey?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.433
Ta-da!

10:46.312 --> 10:47.480
No, I mean...

10:53.444 --> 10:55.196
What are you doing?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.080
But you're ruining your pants.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.333
Patience is what we need to have.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.585
Can you do the other?

11:10.462 --> 11:14.799
Still, lots of sharp
objects going around the...

11:14.883 --> 11:16.718
I don't know you well
enough to let you do this.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.220
- Well...
- Oh my God.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.388
It's all right.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.639
Okay.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.767
All right, I can work
with this, this is good.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.812
All right. I'll pull
these down a little bit.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.316
There we go.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.400
And these?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.236
Here.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.448
Yeah, it's...

11:38.531 --> 11:39.491
It works?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.078
Hey!

11:44.162 --> 11:45.914
Alright, we gotta go.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.081
Quick shower, come on.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.063
So what have you been doing in Greece?

12:10.146 --> 12:12.440
I'm a lawyer, an immigration lawyer.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.608
Freelance.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.901
Oh God!

12:14.984 --> 12:16.069
- Oh God!
- Come on.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.238
I just try to help people get into America.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.989
Well, that's great.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.574
What, you don't like lawyers?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.785
Depends on the person, you know.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.662
Everybody's different.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.664
'cause you seem to like this lawyer.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.916
We'll see.

12:39.634 --> 12:43.972
If I get to sing, you're gonna
have to take your shirt off.

12:44.055 --> 12:44.889
Get ready.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.738
You're gonna miss this, right?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.491
Well, I gave it 18 months.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.410
I think that's long enough.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.327
Is it?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.330
What's the reason now, come on.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.875
You got an ex-husband?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.252
You have some kids?

13:15.211 --> 13:16.754
Did you get fired?

13:16.838 --> 13:19.966
I have a variety of reasons.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.134
Yeah, okay.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.387
You're so secretive!

13:24.471 --> 13:25.889
How long have you been here?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.682
Seven years, baby.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.976
Wow, really? Why?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.644
Why not? Look around you.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.605
Yeah, I guess.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.775
And you're from Cleveland?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.153
You like the Cleveland Cavaliers?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.654
Actually, I'm from Blanchester.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.865
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.533
It's Ohio.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.912
It has a population of 4,763 people.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.163
All those nice people.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.998
Did you sleep with all of them?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.416
I'm related to all of them.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.334
I bet.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.879
I moved to Chicago though.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.632
So I sort of see myself as a big city girl.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.636
I like Chicago, they've
good deep dish pizza.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.222
Where are you from, that's
so fucking fantastic?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.309
Originally New Orleans,
but I lived in New York

14:11.392 --> 14:13.269
for 10 years, 'cause I was in a band.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.397
Oh my gosh, so cool.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.315
Very cool.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.152
So why did you leave?

14:21.236 --> 14:23.238
So I can have sex with you on a beach.

14:35.959 --> 14:36.793
How are you?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.795
I'm alright, how are you?

14:38.878 --> 14:39.921
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- This is Chloe.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.673
- This is Takis.
- Nice to meet you too.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.677
Well, he usually leaves with one.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.720
Now he comes in with one.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.305
- Well...
- Good to know.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.224
- Thank you.
- People change, so...

14:52.559 --> 14:55.019
Listen, I want you to do something.

14:55.103 --> 15:00.108
DJ Fever checks in late
last night and he says

15:01.276 --> 15:03.153
"I want to play the sunset slot".

15:03.236 --> 15:05.071
DJ Fever wants to play the sunset?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.990
Yes, he wants to play the sunset slot.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.993
He's going to send the sunset to the stars.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.119
Is he?

15:11.202 --> 15:13.538
He's going to destroy all this beauty.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.915
- Problem?
- Sure. No, I love it.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.500
He's great, he's great.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.461
You better watch out for this guy, right?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.921
I'll keep my eyes on him, thank you.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.299
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.216
Cheers.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.806
We're all gonna die tonight.

15:53.578 --> 15:58.583
Hey, come on!

16:03.922 --> 16:04.756
Hi!

16:49.384 --> 16:50.760
Come on.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.355
You're amazing.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.773
I never ever dance, ever.

17:04.858 --> 17:05.733
Come on.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.068
Oh, come on, you were so good.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.027
Look at this.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.570
People wanna hear fucking shit.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.488
Stop.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.131
This is Chloe.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.091
Hi, I'm so glad.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.738
Today is the big day, huh?

18:35.949 --> 18:37.242
24 hours.

18:38.952 --> 18:39.828
And less.

18:44.249 --> 18:49.254
Do you ever think, "Oh
what the fuck am I doing?"

18:52.423 --> 18:53.842
Like, what am I actually fucking doing?

19:01.516 --> 19:02.350
Not really.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.310
Never?

19:06.271 --> 19:10.066
I mean, sure, but it's more like,

19:10.984 --> 19:12.819
"Why did I just open the fridge?

19:13.778 --> 19:15.530
I know I didn't really want to."

19:15.613 --> 19:17.198
Oh my God.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.159
This is so fucking...

19:19.242 --> 19:20.827
That is such a good way to live.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.914
Is that how you've lasted seven years here?

19:24.998 --> 19:25.832
Yeah.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.546
And I have a son.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.465
You have a son?

19:35.717 --> 19:36.551
Yeah.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.304
- Wow.
- Does that freak you out?

19:39.387 --> 19:40.472
No, no.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.515
'cause I'm a really great father.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.893
No, I'm not saying that...

19:44.976 --> 19:46.811
You just didn't see me as a father.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.564
It's not...

19:49.647 --> 19:50.982
Hey, listen, you know, it's...

19:53.985 --> 19:54.861
What's his name?

19:56.446 --> 19:57.530
His name is Hector.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.033
It's a good name.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.577
It is.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.995
How old is he?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.874
He is six years old.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.547
That's the room in the house.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.841
- Oh.
- My roommate's room.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.344
That's sweet.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.181
When do you see him?

20:25.475 --> 20:30.480
Whenever I can, but it
depends on his mom too.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.482
Things are bad with her?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.234
You're not together with her, are you?

20:35.109 --> 20:36.569
No.

20:36.653 --> 20:37.946
Okay, I was just...

20:38.029 --> 20:39.864
- No, I'm not.
- I was just checking.

20:39.948 --> 20:40.824
Oh, it's fine.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.451
I mean, look, it's, you know...

20:43.535 --> 20:44.869
It's a work in progress.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.539
Still.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.584
But you wanna see him, right?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.420
Of course.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.645
Oh, that's nice.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.272
I wouldn't wear it, though.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.189
Why?

21:13.273 --> 21:14.399
Because it's not very me.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.985
Maybe it's me.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.736
You'll look good in it.

21:19.904 --> 21:24.159
Could we get two coffees
please, the cold ones?

21:24.242 --> 21:25.535
Thank you.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.162
I've gotta call Argyris.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.746
- Why?
- 'cause of your bag.

21:30.748 --> 21:35.170
Oh, what's your last name?

21:35.253 --> 21:36.379
Gains.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.672
- Gains?
- Yeah, Gains.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.841
Like, gains momentum?

21:43.595 --> 21:45.013
Argyris, are you drunk?

21:45.096 --> 21:48.892
It's a handbag, like a bag,
like a, you know, like a thing.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.352
Yeah, with a purse and a ID in it.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.354
Exactly.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.940
And her name is Chloe Gains.

21:56.024 --> 21:56.900
That's her name.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.027
All right, I'm gonna come and get it.

21:59.110 --> 21:59.944
Thanks.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.191
Thank you.

22:01.230 --> 22:05.658
Thank you.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.286
There's a ferry every two hours.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.383
You know what I think?

22:22.467 --> 22:24.969
We can skip a couple of boats.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.164
You know what?

22:53.248 --> 22:54.082
What?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.545
You're not going back.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.255
What are you talking about?

23:00.338 --> 23:02.382
America, you're not going back.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.051
I'm leaving in like hours.

23:05.135 --> 23:09.055
Well, you're gonna make
a big mistake if you do.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.515
What are you talking about?

23:10.598 --> 23:12.142
You're always gonna
regret not doing something

23:12.225 --> 23:15.019
rather than doing something,
and you're gonna regret it.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.148
How do you know what I'm gonna regret?

23:19.023 --> 23:22.527
Look, do you wanna go back?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.488
It doesn't matter.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.575
I told you, we talked
about this, it doesn't...

23:28.658 --> 23:29.909
Do you wanna go back?

23:35.415 --> 23:36.249
Okay.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.460
You shouldn't make assumptions

23:38.543 --> 23:40.462
about what you think is good for me

23:40.545 --> 23:42.589
when we've only fucked a couple of times.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.012
Wow.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.306
I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.515
I'm just...

23:52.599 --> 23:53.516
Well, it sounded like you were.

24:39.354 --> 24:40.522
You're free.

24:41.773 --> 24:42.607
Of the helmet.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.027
He should be here soon, I guess.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.862
I'm really sorry about
what I said on the boat.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.364
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

24:49.447 --> 24:50.698
No, I didn't mean it.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.243
It's all right.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.831
Really, I didn't mean it.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.500
Oh my God!

25:00.583 --> 25:03.545
You wanna go through the door?

25:03.628 --> 25:05.547
Check this out, perfect timing.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.632
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.009
Sorry, I lost a few
condoms on the way over.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.137
Funny.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.389
Thank you.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.599
You guys have been fucking, right?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.893
It's written all over your face.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.895
Okay, on that note, I'm gonna go.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.106
Thanks for my bag.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.065
All right.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.441
Okay, thank you, Mickey.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.819
It's been really nice.

25:41.958 --> 25:45.336
So this guy has been living
in my dead grandmother's house

25:45.420 --> 25:48.756
for over six years and
he hasn't touched a thing.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.341
What's wrong with you, man?

25:51.593 --> 25:52.760
What's up man?

25:52.844 --> 25:54.429
You look like I shot your back, what's up?

25:56.306 --> 25:57.765
Nothing, nothing.

25:57.849 --> 26:00.351
Come here, come here, I
wanna show you something.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.612
What, man?

26:10.695 --> 26:11.738
What's wrong with you, man?

26:11.821 --> 26:12.989
You look like a crying pussy.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.908
Who the fuck are all these people?

26:16.117 --> 26:17.994
These people are our buddies, what's wrong?

26:18.077 --> 26:20.038
I'm tired, I had a long weekend, all right?

26:20.121 --> 26:22.123
I don't wanna fucking deal with anybody.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.963
Are you in love with this girl?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.423
Fuck you.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.470
- Stop.
- You fucker.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.055
You're in love with this girl.

26:38.056 --> 26:38.932
Stop.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.141
Do you know what you are?

26:40.225 --> 26:42.143
You are fucking lucky. Where is she now?

26:44.979 --> 26:45.855
She's at the airport.

26:45.939 --> 26:46.773
Let's go fucking find her.

26:46.856 --> 26:47.816
No, I'm not fucking...

26:47.899 --> 26:48.983
It's ridiculous.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.527
No, what's ridiculous is you sitting there

26:50.610 --> 26:52.779
farting into my couch feeling
sorry for yourself all night.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.280
Come on, we'll take the bike.

26:54.364 --> 26:55.990
Come on. We'll get the bike.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.826
- Come on.
- Fuck!

27:13.466 --> 27:14.926
Good luck, man.

27:30.108 --> 27:30.942
Chloe!

27:31.943 --> 27:32.777
Chloe!

27:32.861 --> 27:33.695
Chloe!

27:59.345 --> 28:00.180
Fuck.

28:09.647 --> 28:10.982
Hello?

28:14.277 --> 28:16.571
Excuse me, who are you?

28:16.654 --> 28:17.780
Who are you?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.032
Who are you? Why are you in my house?

28:19.115 --> 28:19.949
- What is this?
- Why are you in my house?

28:20.033 --> 28:21.367
You wanna fight?

28:21.451 --> 28:22.452
You wanna fight?

28:22.535 --> 28:23.369
You wanna fight?

28:23.453 --> 28:24.287
Yeah, I do.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.956
Come on. Come on.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.923
- Hello.
- Hi. Hello!

28:35.006 --> 28:36.257
What's with the swimwear?

28:36.341 --> 28:39.177
I was cooking and crying.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.345
Cooking and crying?

28:40.428 --> 28:41.262
- Yes.
- Oh my God.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.430
I was chopping onions.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.057
So I had to, you know?

28:44.140 --> 28:45.266
Because you were cooking for me?

28:45.350 --> 28:46.810
Yeah, because I was cooking for you.

28:46.893 --> 28:50.480
- Oh my God, that is too hot.
- Because it's...

28:58.363 --> 28:59.364
Oh my God!

29:02.534 --> 29:04.035
You got me a present.

29:04.118 --> 29:07.080
I got you a little something.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.832
You got me a helmet.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.127
- With my name on it.
- Yes.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.044
Oh my God.

29:13.128 --> 29:14.921
This is a very special helmet.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.423
For very special people.

29:18.508 --> 29:21.136
And then it goes like that.

29:21.219 --> 29:22.053
Wow.

29:22.137 --> 29:22.971
Yeah.

29:24.889 --> 29:25.723
Helmet sex?

29:25.807 --> 29:26.975
You know, it's perfect

29:27.058 --> 29:28.977
when you can't see what's happening.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.061
Oh my God.

29:34.983 --> 29:35.817
Wait, wait, wait.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.153
What about the van? Did you get a van?

29:38.236 --> 29:40.113
- The van?
- The van to move my stuff.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.823
I did not get the van.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.199
I did not get the van.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.617
But I sent you everything to get the van.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.327
Yes, I know, but you know what?

29:46.411 --> 29:48.538
You can't rent a van in Greece, okay?

29:48.621 --> 29:51.624
There's not any free vans and...

29:51.708 --> 29:52.584
You're gonna call for a van now?

29:52.667 --> 29:53.501
It's gonna take me two seconds.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.295
- Can I get one?
- Excuse me.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.671
Excuse me, I'm busy on my phone.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.631
Please don't look at my phone.

29:58.715 --> 30:01.551
Girl, I can't do my work.

30:01.634 --> 30:02.802
- You get me a van...
- I will get you a van.

30:02.886 --> 30:04.679
Then I will give you all of this.

30:04.762 --> 30:06.681
Come on, I'll get you a van.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.057
Hey!

30:15.815 --> 30:16.649
Fuck.

30:18.985 --> 30:22.280
Argyris?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.869
You're a fucking legend, man.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.204
Yeah.

30:29.287 --> 30:30.872
Okay, thank you.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.832
Text me the address, please.

30:32.916 --> 30:33.750
Okay.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.338
I got a fucking van.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.132
Oh my God, how did you do that?

30:41.216 --> 30:42.342
I got a van.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.470
How did you get it?

30:46.679 --> 30:47.722
Did I say to you I'll get a van?

30:47.806 --> 30:49.432
- You said, you said.
- Did I say?

30:49.516 --> 30:51.726
- We have a van!
- You said.

30:51.810 --> 30:52.769
Come on, let's go.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.103
God.

30:54.187 --> 30:55.688
To the people of Kypseli,

30:55.772 --> 30:58.316
Mickey Henry's got a fucking van.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.445
God, it better not be that one.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.363
Hey!

31:04.447 --> 31:05.281
Hi.

31:08.465 --> 31:10.425
We're looking for Pantelis.

31:10.488 --> 31:11.663
Pantelis!

31:11.747 --> 31:12.789
Yeah?

31:12.873 --> 31:13.874
Some foreigners...

31:16.042 --> 31:17.794
- Pantelis.
- Hi.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.087
- Oh.
- Sorry.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.296
Next time.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.214
Listen, we're here for the van.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.298
There.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.591
Great, I like it.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.301
I need 100 Euros.

31:25.385 --> 31:26.928
- What?
- What?

31:27.011 --> 31:28.721
For the deposit, you know.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.431
But you said it was free on the phone.

31:30.515 --> 31:31.641
The van is free.

31:31.724 --> 31:32.976
You pay for the damage, you know.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.310
The damage to that?

31:34.394 --> 31:36.354
No, no, no. That makes...

31:36.437 --> 31:37.772
That's true. okay.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.693
40.

31:41.776 --> 31:42.694
Do you have...

31:45.155 --> 31:46.698
Here.

31:46.781 --> 31:47.615
Okay.

31:49.909 --> 31:50.743
It's...

31:53.204 --> 31:54.164
It's disgusting.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.210
Let's be roomies.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.211
Let's be roomies.

32:01.254 --> 32:02.672
Oh, hang on.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.094
Hello.

32:10.388 --> 32:11.222
All right.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.266
What's coming?

32:13.349 --> 32:14.684
- Everything.
- Everything?

32:15.810 --> 32:17.520
- This is all coming?
- Yes.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.231
Yeah, but look how neat
it is, it's like perfect.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.191
It's really easy.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.276
What were you gonna do with this stuff

32:23.359 --> 32:24.611
when you were going to America?

32:24.694 --> 32:26.654
Everything was going to America

32:26.738 --> 32:29.032
but now I'm not going to America,

32:29.115 --> 32:31.701
everything is going to your house.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.204
What did you think was gonna happen?

32:34.287 --> 32:35.997
I was gonna bring my handbag?

32:36.080 --> 32:38.500
- Yes, of course.
- I have a life here

32:38.583 --> 32:40.251
and it's in these boxes.

32:40.335 --> 32:41.753
But this is staying.

32:41.836 --> 32:45.089
No, this couch is the only
thing I invested money in

32:45.173 --> 32:46.341
in my entire time-

32:46.424 --> 32:47.884
- See, that's so troublesome.
- In Athens.

32:47.967 --> 32:51.054
We're gonna have our first
really, really big fight.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.180
You wanna fight?

32:53.389 --> 32:54.349
- I will fight you-
- Do you wanna fight?

32:54.432 --> 32:56.309
To the death about that couch.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.399
Well, well, I see you're in Athens.

33:44.482 --> 33:45.316
What do you know?

33:59.372 --> 34:01.124
By the way, I've peed in that corner.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.085
My God, I believe that.

34:04.169 --> 34:07.255
I think you've probably peed
in a lot of places around here.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.173
Yeah.

34:08.256 --> 34:09.424
It's quite territorial.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.885
Well, I need to find my way home at night.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.355
Come on!

34:24.438 --> 34:25.690
Really?

34:25.773 --> 34:27.065
Hey!

34:27.150 --> 34:28.400
Come on!

34:28.485 --> 34:31.279
Listen, in this country you have to scream.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.655
That's how it is.

34:32.739 --> 34:33.614
- It's not helpful for me.
- I'm going right.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.449
- I don't care, I'm going right.
- It's a dead end.

34:35.533 --> 34:36.409
Oh my God.

34:36.493 --> 34:38.203
Hang on, I'm going right.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.536
- It's a dead end!
- It's not a dead end.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.956
Nothing in Greece is a dead end.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.208
What is it? What is it?

34:44.292 --> 34:45.627
Tell me what it is.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.585
Tell me what it is, Mickey.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.795
Tell me what it is.

34:47.879 --> 34:48.755
- Tell me what it is.
- It's a dead end.

34:48.838 --> 34:49.755
Yeah, it's a dead end.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.007
You know what?

34:51.090 --> 34:51.966
You're gonna have to pay the ticket.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.135
Oh my God, what are you doing?

34:54.219 --> 34:55.303
No, no.

34:55.386 --> 34:58.014
- We can't do it here.
- Yes we can.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.183
It's too uncomfortable.

35:04.896 --> 35:05.730
Sh!

35:11.903 --> 35:13.404
Well, here we are.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.281
Here we are.

35:26.000 --> 35:26.835
All right.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.758
Mrs. Kostopoulos.

35:33.842 --> 35:35.051
Very helpful as always.

35:35.135 --> 35:37.137
- All right, okay.
- Good morning.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.471
Good morning.

35:42.809 --> 35:43.643
You got it?

35:43.726 --> 35:44.644
Oh, fuck.

36:00.743 --> 36:01.578
Hey.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.382
Okay.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.926
I know you don't wanna use this room.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.220
I know you wanna keep it the same

36:19.304 --> 36:21.055
so that when he comes
back it's here forever,

36:21.139 --> 36:23.099
and that's everything I
think is great about you.

36:23.183 --> 36:27.979
But I think we need to use the room, okay?

36:29.939 --> 36:32.692
It's important to me too, I'm
gonna help you get him back.

36:32.775 --> 36:35.570
And he'll be here, and
his room will be here.

36:35.653 --> 36:36.488
Okay?

36:43.244 --> 36:44.078
Is that a yes?

36:46.331 --> 36:47.540
- Yes.
- It's an okay.

36:59.719 --> 37:01.429
- Come on, oh.
- Stop, hold on.

37:01.554 --> 37:02.472
Okay, okay, okay.

37:02.555 --> 37:03.598
Oh, my arm, my arm, my arm.

37:03.681 --> 37:05.183
Okay.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.684
I'm sorry.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.436
Hold on, okay.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.437
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

37:09.521 --> 37:10.855
- You good?
- Oh, fuck.

37:12.232 --> 37:13.066
- Okay.
- Come on.

37:13.149 --> 37:13.983
Oh shit.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.652
All right, come on, hold on.

37:15.735 --> 37:16.903
Just...

37:16.986 --> 37:18.238
Wait, wait wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:18.321 --> 37:20.156
Wait, wait, I got it, hold it.

37:21.449 --> 37:22.283
Okay.

37:23.117 --> 37:23.952
Oh fuck.

37:24.035 --> 37:25.328
Oh no, no, no.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.579
- Okay, it's okay.
- Easy, okay, okay, okay.

37:26.663 --> 37:27.831
- You got it?
- Slowly, slowly.

37:27.914 --> 37:29.749
All right, here's what gonna happen.

37:29.833 --> 37:30.959
I'm gonna go up first a little bit,

37:31.042 --> 37:32.377
I'm gonna bring it up a little bit.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.337
So just hold and stay in place

37:34.420 --> 37:36.131
and then I'm gonna come
and switch with you, okay?

37:36.214 --> 37:37.799
- Okay.
- So just wait.

37:37.882 --> 37:38.883
Okay.

37:38.967 --> 37:39.801
- Fuck!
- Okay, okay.

37:39.884 --> 37:41.761
Alright, switch with me, okay?

37:41.845 --> 37:43.888
Switch with me. Go, go, go.

37:48.977 --> 37:50.019
Are you okay?

37:50.103 --> 37:51.437
Yes.

37:51.521 --> 37:52.772
- Are you sure?
- Are you holding it?

37:52.856 --> 37:53.940
Fuck.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.817
Push it up.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.985
- God.
- Fuck!

37:59.904 --> 38:01.030
Okay.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.615
This is your couch, it descends.

38:02.699 --> 38:04.200
I know!

38:04.284 --> 38:06.077
It's like giving birth.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.996
Fuck! Come on.

38:08.079 --> 38:09.581
Oh, shit.

38:09.664 --> 38:10.498
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

38:10.582 --> 38:11.416
I'm sorry.

38:17.630 --> 38:18.798
Please don't ruin it.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.352
You wanna know what I think?

38:31.436 --> 38:32.270
Tell me.

38:33.688 --> 38:35.773
I think we're gonna have to
say goodbye to this thing.

38:35.857 --> 38:38.318
No, it's my, the one thing.

38:39.819 --> 38:40.904
And I know exactly what to do.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.989
This is the only thing I spent money on.

38:44.491 --> 38:45.325
I know exactly what to do.

38:45.408 --> 38:46.242
Oh, no.

38:48.745 --> 38:50.955
We can keep trying.

38:51.039 --> 38:51.873
We did.

38:53.791 --> 38:55.877
No, I love this couch.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.295
Hey, hey, hey.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.382
I know.

39:01.466 --> 39:02.300
Twice in a day.

39:05.303 --> 39:06.137
Perfect.

39:06.971 --> 39:08.473
Hey!

39:08.556 --> 39:09.891
Hey!

39:09.974 --> 39:11.059
What's going on?

39:11.142 --> 39:12.769
What's up?

39:12.852 --> 39:13.686
Alright.

39:13.812 --> 39:15.606
Come on guys, let's go!

39:16.564 --> 39:21.569
Oh my God!

39:22.737 --> 39:23.571
Yo, easy Mickey!

39:23.655 --> 39:25.698
- We can see you.
- Hello.

39:25.782 --> 39:27.242
Wow, who's that guy?

39:27.325 --> 39:28.743
This is Greg.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.119
Oh my God.

39:30.203 --> 39:31.079
Oh.

39:31.162 --> 39:32.622
How old is your friend?

39:33.915 --> 39:35.083
Like, 40, 42.

39:36.501 --> 39:38.378
He looks like a giant baby.

39:42.715 --> 39:44.801
They're gonna be your friends now.

39:44.884 --> 39:49.889
I'm so excited about it, that's great.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.229
Okay?

39:56.312 --> 39:57.689
More than okay.

40:08.919 --> 40:09.560
Hey.

40:09.630 --> 40:11.912
Hey! What's with that racket every night?

40:14.789 --> 40:16.791
Please, please come down.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.209
Juliet, come on.

40:28.303 --> 40:29.137
Hey!

40:30.972 --> 40:31.806
Hey!

40:33.099 --> 40:33.975
Oh my God!

40:34.058 --> 40:35.018
How are you?

40:35.101 --> 40:36.102
You look great.

40:36.186 --> 40:37.228
No, you look good.

40:37.312 --> 40:38.396
This is Mickey, guys.

40:38.480 --> 40:39.314
This is the one I was telling you about.

40:39.397 --> 40:40.398
Hey, this is Chloe.

40:40.482 --> 40:42.066
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

40:42.150 --> 40:43.860
- I'm Bastian.
- This is Bastian.

40:43.943 --> 40:46.237
I know who you are. Oh my God.

40:46.321 --> 40:48.072
- Nice to meet you.
- Very, very special person.

40:48.156 --> 40:49.449
Happy fucking birthday.

40:49.532 --> 40:51.409
Thank you so much.

40:51.493 --> 40:53.620
- Here he is.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

40:53.703 --> 40:54.579
What the fuck!

40:54.662 --> 40:55.705
What is this?

40:56.706 --> 40:58.541
This is fucking amazing.

40:58.625 --> 41:01.419
Hey, hey, hey. Listen up for a second.

41:01.503 --> 41:02.837
You know who this is?

41:05.799 --> 41:07.258
Well, she's gonna take
over for a little while.

41:07.342 --> 41:09.511
So make sure you give her a
little bit of love, all right?

41:09.594 --> 41:12.430
And also, Chloe Gains.

41:13.807 --> 41:17.185
I know that today we
lost your favorite couch,

41:17.268 --> 41:21.356
but today we gained a family.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.694
You guys wanna be Chloe's family?

41:26.778 --> 41:29.113
Fuck yeah!

41:40.083 --> 41:41.876
- I love you.
- I love you.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.711
I fucking love you.

42:17.162 --> 42:20.331
Okay, back up, back up, here we go.

42:20.415 --> 42:21.457
Hey!

42:21.541 --> 42:22.709
Back up.

42:22.792 --> 42:23.626
It's time.

42:24.878 --> 42:25.712
Oh shit.

42:26.713 --> 42:27.547
Shit.

42:28.673 --> 42:29.507
Oh, shit.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.634
Oh, shit!

42:32.802 --> 42:34.637
Give me that, give me that, give me that.

42:34.721 --> 42:36.764
You don't want it anymore.

42:36.848 --> 42:38.099
It's gonna be, baby, I'm sorry.

42:38.183 --> 42:39.100
There you go.

42:39.184 --> 42:41.060
Fucking do it.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.397
- Whoo!
- This is Kypseli!

42:49.736 --> 42:52.405
Bye bye!

43:28.233 --> 43:29.150
- Fuck, that was crazy.
- Oh, I'm glad.

43:29.234 --> 43:30.902
Everyone is lunatic in Athens.

43:33.112 --> 43:34.823
- There you go.
- Oh, thanks.

43:34.906 --> 43:36.699
No more couch.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.284
We did it.

43:38.368 --> 43:39.911
I can't believe you did that.

43:41.287 --> 43:42.664
It's gonna be all right.

43:42.747 --> 43:44.123
It's gonna be okay.

43:44.207 --> 43:46.584
You got what you wanted,
that's why it's okay.

43:46.668 --> 43:48.294
Thank you for coming.

43:48.378 --> 43:49.921
Ah, you're welcome.

43:50.004 --> 43:52.423
I really like that shirt you're wearing.

43:52.507 --> 43:53.341
Oh yeah.

43:53.424 --> 43:54.342
This was your band?

43:54.425 --> 43:55.260
Yeah, that was...

43:55.343 --> 43:56.845
And you had T-shirts?

43:56.928 --> 43:58.721
- We did. Yeah.
- It's a neighborhood

43:58.805 --> 44:01.558
in New Orleans where we did our first gig.

44:01.641 --> 44:03.935
- Oh, wow.
- When we were very young.

44:04.018 --> 44:06.604
Yeah, and we got a deal...

44:06.688 --> 44:07.730
You got a deal.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.858
No, we got a deal.

44:09.941 --> 44:11.526
- Don't fucking start that.
- You got a deal.

44:11.609 --> 44:14.696
And we were just there for the ride.

44:14.779 --> 44:17.157
- So tell me what happened.
- What really happened was,

44:17.240 --> 44:18.616
we fucking got our deal.

44:18.700 --> 44:21.369
We made our album, it was fantastic.

44:21.452 --> 44:22.579
Okay.

44:22.662 --> 44:24.956
We take the album on tour, right?

44:25.039 --> 44:26.583
Tour's amazing as well.

44:26.666 --> 44:30.044
Right at the fucking end,
at peak, peak success,

44:30.128 --> 44:33.673
this fucking guy, this
Mickey go lucky goes solo.

44:33.756 --> 44:35.049
Out of nowhere.

44:35.133 --> 44:36.551
Leaves us hanging.

44:36.634 --> 44:40.096
I went to New York because I
didn't really have a choice.

44:40.180 --> 44:41.514
And you were doing

44:41.598 --> 44:42.891
- your own thing and you went-
- You had a choice.

44:42.974 --> 44:44.058
- And you had your own thing
- Yeah, what else

44:44.142 --> 44:45.310
- was I supposed to do.
- Because it was

44:45.393 --> 44:46.561
the Bastian show, and it was great.

44:46.644 --> 44:48.062
- We made that band.
- And it was great.

44:48.146 --> 44:49.731
You became super famous, you
got like 18 million followers.

44:49.814 --> 44:51.399
You're good on Instagram, whatever.

44:51.483 --> 44:54.736
Yeah, I had to go make an
album because you fucking left.

44:54.819 --> 44:56.738
And I think it's a great album.

44:56.821 --> 44:58.823
- It's not the fucking point.
- Come on, I love it.

44:58.907 --> 45:00.200
No. No, fuck you.

45:00.283 --> 45:03.244
You know what, he kept
every fucking bad review

45:03.328 --> 45:04.329
the band got.

45:04.412 --> 45:05.246
Every single one.

45:05.330 --> 45:06.414
Why keep them?

45:07.332 --> 45:08.917
'cause I don't, I can't...

45:09.000 --> 45:10.835
- I wanted to improve
- Tell her why.

45:10.919 --> 45:11.753
- And I wanted to know...
- Every single one.

45:11.836 --> 45:12.962
I wanna know

45:13.046 --> 45:14.130
- what everyone thinks.
- No, you done it

45:14.214 --> 45:15.423
because you fucking hate yourself.

45:15.507 --> 45:16.966
That's your fucking problem.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.218
That's not, that's not...

45:18.301 --> 45:21.805
You are not happy unless you're failing.

45:21.888 --> 45:22.806
- Whoa.
- And that's why

45:22.889 --> 45:23.848
you left the band.

45:25.225 --> 45:26.059
Wow.

45:28.561 --> 45:31.105
So I guess I'll get
happy with another drink,

45:31.189 --> 45:32.398
I mean, you know.

45:32.482 --> 45:34.108
- Yeah, fucking get me one.
- Oh no, fuck.

45:36.277 --> 45:37.487
Jesus.

45:37.570 --> 45:38.780
I'm gonna put some music on.

45:38.863 --> 45:43.868
Okay, put some music on.

45:54.337 --> 45:56.131
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

45:56.214 --> 45:58.883
What does it fucking look like I'm doing?

45:58.967 --> 46:01.636
Oh God, come on, let's go.

46:01.719 --> 46:02.804
Grandma's asleep, don't fucking...

46:02.887 --> 46:04.430
Come on, let's go, let's go.

46:04.514 --> 46:06.015
For fuck's sake.

46:21.322 --> 46:24.033
Do you ever think about coming home?

46:24.117 --> 46:24.951
No.

46:26.077 --> 46:30.123
Why?

46:30.206 --> 46:32.083
Why think about it?

46:33.877 --> 46:35.920
I think you should come home.

46:36.004 --> 46:37.755
Like, people have changed.

46:38.798 --> 46:39.632
Hey.

46:40.425 --> 46:41.259
Hey, babe.

46:41.342 --> 46:42.177
Hey.

46:43.678 --> 46:44.846
Do you wanna...

46:44.929 --> 46:46.306
- Do you want some?
- Can you hurry up?

46:46.389 --> 46:47.765
I need to pee.

46:47.849 --> 46:48.975
Okay, yeah, yeah.

46:49.058 --> 46:50.310
Yeah, we'll be right out.

46:53.354 --> 46:54.189
Fuck.

46:56.274 --> 46:57.275
Anything I said?

46:59.652 --> 47:00.737
Oh bug.

47:02.447 --> 47:04.115
Are you even serious?

47:07.285 --> 47:08.411
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

47:08.495 --> 47:11.456
Like what, met your kid serious?

47:11.539 --> 47:13.374
No, no, she hasn't met him yet.

47:13.458 --> 47:15.418
But she's going to, she's...

47:19.756 --> 47:21.299
I got a fucking kid now.

47:21.382 --> 47:22.217
- I know.
- What the fuck!

47:22.300 --> 47:23.635
I mean, I saw that.

47:24.928 --> 47:26.554
I couldn't believe that.

47:26.638 --> 47:29.516
Like, how the fuck have we got kids?

47:29.599 --> 47:31.226
We're getting old.

47:31.309 --> 47:34.270
Listen. I think we should
start writing again.

47:35.980 --> 47:36.940
Like seriously.

47:37.023 --> 47:40.235
I've got fucking six months left.

47:40.318 --> 47:44.113
Come with me. We can
start writing on the road.

47:44.197 --> 47:45.073
It will be great.

47:47.659 --> 47:49.661
- No.
- No, look.

47:49.744 --> 47:54.207
I'm fucking sick of doing
the same shit over and over.

47:54.290 --> 47:56.501
They sent me to work with
these fucking weird guys

47:56.584 --> 47:58.002
in New York, LA.

47:58.086 --> 47:59.420
They've got fucking plaques
on the wall, blah, blah, blah.

47:59.504 --> 48:01.422
I work with fucking Maroon 5.

48:01.506 --> 48:03.758
We fucking hate Maroon 5.

48:03.842 --> 48:05.051
I mean, think about it.

48:05.135 --> 48:06.469
All right, yeah.

48:06.553 --> 48:08.471
Like, I miss you.

48:09.514 --> 48:10.682
Come with me.

48:32.203 --> 48:36.457
Is it true you're only
happy when you're failing?

48:37.584 --> 48:38.418
No.

49:36.559 --> 49:38.436
I'm so sorry about that.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.897
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine, thank you.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.066
Again, I'm really sorry
we have to do this here.

49:43.149 --> 49:46.069
I'm still between offices at the moment.

49:46.152 --> 49:47.028
That's fine.

49:47.111 --> 49:48.446
Thank you for squeezing me in.

49:48.530 --> 49:51.282
No problem and I'm really
sorry about the noise.

49:51.366 --> 49:53.785
We're both trying to work
from home today, so...

49:55.203 --> 49:58.039
Okay, so, the reason that there
was a problem with your J-1

49:58.122 --> 50:00.708
is because you already held that status

50:00.792 --> 50:02.043
of a researcher in the US.

50:02.127 --> 50:03.920
So you're no longer,

50:04.003 --> 50:05.964
you don't meet the eligibility criteria.

50:06.047 --> 50:07.301
Does that make sense?

50:07.356 --> 50:09.635
When Greece becomes
the centre of the world.

50:10.802 --> 50:13.931
Then the only solution
is Lioggos fertilizer.

50:15.307 --> 50:20.354
Lioggos: certified
fertilizer for the new era.

50:22.063 --> 50:23.231
- Wow.
- Good job, man.

50:23.314 --> 50:24.816
- Beautifully shot.
- Good job, yeah.

50:24.899 --> 50:26.526
Nice music, man.

50:26.609 --> 50:28.736
Okay, are you done congratulating
each other, okay, yeah?

50:30.071 --> 50:33.783
No. This is totally not what we discussed.

50:33.867 --> 50:36.286
And it's total crap.

50:36.369 --> 50:37.912
- Total crap?
- This is a total crap.

50:37.996 --> 50:40.915
Total crap, and there is a
basic, very basic reason for it.

50:40.999 --> 50:44.127
It has no Greekness that kinda
comes from the Greek soil,

50:44.210 --> 50:46.421
from the Greek nature,
from the mentality...

50:46.504 --> 50:47.755
Can you stop interrupting me?

50:47.839 --> 50:49.215
Would you mind not smoking, also?

50:49.299 --> 50:50.744
No, I like smoking in my house.

50:50.801 --> 50:52.720
Come on Manos, it's my house.

50:52.785 --> 50:53.619
It's okay, it's okay.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.096
Manos, he can smoke.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.222
- Is it okay if I smoke?
- Of course it's okay. Go on.

50:56.306 --> 50:57.640
Let's get the briefing first.

50:57.724 --> 50:59.225
I'm trying to help you here.

50:59.309 --> 51:00.435
Yeah, the briefing was,
you know, a little funny.

51:00.518 --> 51:02.187
The briefing is that
we simply need something

51:02.270 --> 51:03.938
that has modernity, that is the same-

51:04.022 --> 51:05.982
- Contemporary.
- Contemporary,

51:06.065 --> 51:08.610
but at the same time, it
conveys a feeling of Greekness.

51:08.693 --> 51:10.361
Something that the Greek
audiences can relate to.

51:10.445 --> 51:11.863
And this is not? This is not?

51:11.946 --> 51:13.490
It's something that you
obviously don't understand.

51:15.366 --> 51:16.618
So this is what you think
when I tell you Greekness?

51:16.701 --> 51:18.077
This is what you come out with?

51:18.161 --> 51:19.495
You come out with a
bouzouki as if we were...

51:19.557 --> 51:21.079
It's traditional man!

51:21.157 --> 51:22.332
I wanna play it safe

51:22.415 --> 51:25.376
'cause I feel like you want
something more safe, so I...

51:25.460 --> 51:27.378
Cut the fucking bouzouki.

51:27.462 --> 51:28.463
I'll cut the bouzouki.

51:28.546 --> 51:29.798
- Thank you.
- If we combine, Manos,

51:29.881 --> 51:32.967
if we combine the bouzouki now

51:33.051 --> 51:33.997
with the modern style...

51:34.075 --> 51:35.592
I don't want the bouzouki man! No bouzouki!

51:35.679 --> 51:36.763
We'll try something else.

51:36.846 --> 51:37.680
What the fuck is this?

51:37.764 --> 51:38.765
Like, this is an amateur night.

51:38.848 --> 51:40.558
Sorry, I have a client.

51:40.642 --> 51:42.435
I am the fucking client here, okay?

51:42.519 --> 51:45.146
Yeah, yeah, we'll be all
right, we'll be quiet, sorry.

51:47.565 --> 51:48.399
I'm sorry.

51:48.483 --> 51:49.651
That's okay.

51:49.734 --> 51:50.652
I would have booked an appointment, but...

51:50.735 --> 51:51.903
There's not enough time.

51:53.029 --> 51:53.905
Christos said...

51:55.240 --> 51:56.491
Said that you're a wizard.

51:58.076 --> 51:59.452
I'm sorry.

51:59.536 --> 52:00.703
I'm sorry. Christos?

52:01.871 --> 52:02.914
Sioutis Christos.

52:04.082 --> 52:04.916
He...

52:06.292 --> 52:07.168
He spoke very highly of you.

52:07.252 --> 52:08.461
He's the reason I called.

52:08.545 --> 52:09.379
Oh...

52:11.131 --> 52:11.965
Okay.

52:13.925 --> 52:15.135
I'm so sorry.

52:15.218 --> 52:18.012
I'm really embarrassed
but I've just realized

52:18.096 --> 52:20.932
I can't take on another client right now.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.226
Wait, sorry, you can't help me?

52:23.309 --> 52:25.186
I mean, did I do something wrong?

52:25.270 --> 52:26.437
No, of course not, it wasn't you.

52:26.521 --> 52:29.440
It's not you, it's me
and I really apologize.

52:30.650 --> 52:33.528
But I'm gonna have to show you out.

52:34.571 --> 52:37.112
I'm so sorry.

52:37.115 --> 52:39.952
But Manos, you're a
little too dogmatic now...

52:40.910 --> 52:44.455
Sorry, am I not being as
clear as possible here?

52:44.539 --> 52:45.665
- We need something-
- No, you're actually being

52:45.748 --> 52:47.333
very contradictory with yourself.

52:47.417 --> 52:49.043
I'm not contradictory with myself, man.

52:49.127 --> 52:50.044
Guys,.

52:50.128 --> 52:52.213
Contemporary briefing.

52:52.297 --> 52:53.923
That could mean one, two, three,

52:54.007 --> 52:55.216
four, five different things.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.176
Give me a minute. I'm
gonna talk to the guy.

52:56.259 --> 52:57.427
I can bring up the musicians

52:57.510 --> 52:58.803
that can fucking do that in a snap.

53:02.348 --> 53:06.227
- Hey.
- Sorry.

53:06.311 --> 53:07.896
Are you finished?

53:10.148 --> 53:11.232
- Oh God.
- I'm sorry.

53:11.316 --> 53:13.276
I told you that might happen.

53:13.359 --> 53:15.236
I mean, it seems to take so long.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.989
Does anyone actually care
whether you use a keyboard or-

53:18.072 --> 53:19.491
- I care.

53:19.574 --> 53:21.367
A little bit, I care.

53:21.451 --> 53:24.871
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

53:24.954 --> 53:26.789
I meant them, you know?

53:29.083 --> 53:30.460
It must be frustrating for you.

53:30.543 --> 53:32.587
You're talented, you know
what you're doing and it's...

53:32.670 --> 53:33.922
Embarrassing, it's embarrassing.

53:34.005 --> 53:34.839
No, I'm not...

53:34.923 --> 53:36.424
Yeah, it's just, you know.

53:36.508 --> 53:39.344
It's just a fucking jingle,
you know, it's all it is.

53:39.427 --> 53:40.345
It's just a fucking little jingle.

53:40.428 --> 53:41.513
No, that's not what I'm saying.

53:43.181 --> 53:45.183
Stop, please, stop.

53:47.352 --> 53:49.229
We've both had a really shitty day.

53:58.530 --> 54:01.450
I want a contemporary
take in traditional tunes!

54:01.533 --> 54:03.660
- Alright, we'll have it.
- Will you?

54:03.744 --> 54:05.287
Yes, we'll work on it today
and tomorrow you'll have it.

54:05.537 --> 54:06.622
It should have been ready
yesterday, as you know.

54:06.705 --> 54:07.873
You'll have it and it will be perfect!

54:07.956 --> 54:08.790
Yesterday!

54:09.707 --> 54:10.583
We got one more shot.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.043
- Yeah, yeah.
- One more shot!

54:12.877 --> 54:14.129
So good, all right.

54:14.212 --> 54:15.296
- It's gonna be great.
- Let me see him out.

54:15.380 --> 54:16.506
- Very Greek.
- Take it easy, huh?

54:16.589 --> 54:17.549
Sure. Sure.

54:17.632 --> 54:18.842
See you tomorrow, man.

54:56.463 --> 54:57.297
Hey.

55:00.592 --> 55:01.426
Why?

55:05.389 --> 55:07.140
Asshole...

55:07.932 --> 55:08.933
No, it's okay.

55:10.518 --> 55:11.644
Yeah, yeah, fine.

55:14.397 --> 55:15.231
What happened?

55:18.526 --> 55:22.822
No, Argyris and Manos, you know,

55:22.906 --> 55:25.617
they can't come over until two, you know.

55:26.951 --> 55:28.786
Okay, so they don't come over then.

55:30.622 --> 55:33.166
Well, it's not that
easy. We have a deadline.

55:35.251 --> 55:37.545
Explain to me what you're saying.

55:37.629 --> 55:38.713
I have to finish the thing.

55:38.797 --> 55:41.132
This fucking jingle thing.

55:42.801 --> 55:45.762
Well, you have to come with
me to see your ex girlfriend.

55:45.845 --> 55:47.263
This is what you have to do.

55:48.765 --> 55:51.184
- Don't start laughing at me.
- I'm not. No, no, no.

55:51.976 --> 55:52.811
- Let's talk about this.
- No, you are coming...

55:52.894 --> 55:53.728
No way!

55:53.812 --> 55:55.480
We are not talking about this.

55:55.563 --> 55:57.524
You cannot leave me.

55:57.607 --> 55:58.733
- Don't try that with me.
- I'm not leaving you.

55:58.817 --> 55:59.776
I'm not leaving you.

55:59.859 --> 56:00.693
You know what I think?

56:00.777 --> 56:02.237
I think it's better.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.905
Let me tell you why.

56:03.988 --> 56:05.114
- No.
- Hold on.

56:05.198 --> 56:06.324
I'm not letting you tell me anything.

56:06.407 --> 56:08.743
No, no, and you're this fucking sexy lawyer

56:08.827 --> 56:10.620
who just can convince
anybody of everything.

56:10.703 --> 56:11.830
- Mickey, no.
- You're amazing

56:11.913 --> 56:13.122
and you're walking like the light

56:13.206 --> 56:14.874
and she's fucking crazy.

56:14.958 --> 56:15.792
Mickey.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.252
Listen to me, listen to me.

56:17.335 --> 56:18.545
It's gonna go wild in two seconds.

56:18.628 --> 56:20.797
And if I'm there, she's
gonna get all hysterical

56:20.880 --> 56:22.048
and try to...

56:22.132 --> 56:23.508
First of all, she's gonna be all jealous.

56:23.591 --> 56:26.094
She's gonna try to one-up
you and it's about...

56:26.177 --> 56:27.137
But what about the party?

56:27.220 --> 56:28.096
Why don't we...

56:28.179 --> 56:29.013
Party's gonna be great.

56:29.097 --> 56:30.306
Yeah, but we can cancel this.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.934
I'll have everything ready.

56:33.017 --> 56:33.852
I'll have everything ready.

56:33.935 --> 56:35.103
- No.
- Listen.

56:35.186 --> 56:36.354
It's just this one time, I promise.

56:36.437 --> 56:37.772
I'm laughing but this is not funny.

56:37.856 --> 56:39.774
- It's just this one time.
- And you can't...

56:39.858 --> 56:40.942
Come on, I'll have sex with you.

56:41.025 --> 56:42.152
You wanna have sex with me?

56:42.235 --> 56:43.361
- Let's go.
- Never.

56:43.444 --> 56:45.947
- I'll do that thing.
- Never again.

56:46.030 --> 56:46.906
- You know that.
- I hate you.

56:46.990 --> 56:48.283
- Come on.
- I hate you.

56:48.366 --> 56:49.242
You're the best.

56:56.624 --> 56:58.460
What about now, man?

56:58.543 --> 57:00.003
This is Greek.

57:00.086 --> 57:01.129
What do you think?

57:01.212 --> 57:02.922
- Greek.
- Fantastic, fantastic.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.258
Gorgeous.

57:05.341 --> 57:06.176
- Hold on.
- Okay, okay.

57:06.259 --> 57:07.886
- Are you joking?
- Can we just...

57:08.052 --> 57:10.138
Thank you. All right.

57:10.221 --> 57:13.933
So, okay, tell you the truth, okay?

57:14.017 --> 57:16.936
I appreciate the work that I've seen

57:17.020 --> 57:19.814
that you've invested but the truth is,

57:19.898 --> 57:21.316
come on Argyris now, you know.

57:21.399 --> 57:24.027
This music is totally not
what we're talking about.

57:24.110 --> 57:26.279
- Oh man.
- This is for fairs.

57:26.362 --> 57:28.364
Like where gypsy people go.

57:28.448 --> 57:29.824
- Manos, sorry, I...
- For fairs?

57:29.908 --> 57:31.159
I honestly...

57:31.242 --> 57:32.076
- For fairs.
- That's the truth.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.620
Let's go, we can...

57:33.703 --> 57:35.497
I want what I asked, Argyris.

57:35.580 --> 57:36.706
You know very well what I want.

57:36.789 --> 57:39.209
We can also go with one more.

57:39.292 --> 57:40.460
- We'll try one more.
- Okay.

57:40.543 --> 57:41.544
- One more, okay.
- You want one more?

57:41.628 --> 57:43.296
- Go one more.
- One more, last one.

57:45.590 --> 57:46.549
Okay.

57:56.226 --> 57:57.519
I love this. Yes!

57:57.602 --> 57:59.854
That's it, man. Yeah!

57:59.938 --> 58:01.147
Yeah, that's perfect.

58:01.231 --> 58:03.107
That's what we talk about, man.

58:03.191 --> 58:05.360
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not fucking joking.

58:05.443 --> 58:06.694
That's perfect.

58:06.778 --> 58:08.863
The minute I hear it, I see images.

58:08.947 --> 58:10.615
- I immediately...
- It's familiar.

58:10.698 --> 58:11.699
It rings home.

58:11.783 --> 58:13.076
It rings home.

58:13.159 --> 58:14.744
- It feels familiar, but...
- It feels familiar,

58:14.828 --> 58:16.704
it has images.

58:16.788 --> 58:20.041
It reminds me of my
grandma, my grandfather.

58:20.124 --> 58:21.000
It combines the elements.

58:21.084 --> 58:22.210
I mean, I see pictures.

58:22.293 --> 58:24.921
I don't have to see the actual video.

58:25.004 --> 58:26.798
I can imagine it just by the sound.

58:27.966 --> 58:29.134
Total.

58:29.217 --> 58:30.635
This is what you put in the brief.

58:30.718 --> 58:32.595
This is the thing you gave me.

58:34.639 --> 58:35.807
Okay, man.

58:35.890 --> 58:39.227
This is like totally,
totally disrespectful.

58:39.310 --> 58:40.687
You like it.

58:40.770 --> 58:41.604
I'm here, I'm trying to
get you a fucking job.

58:41.688 --> 58:42.773
- You like it, so use it.
- You asshole...

58:42.856 --> 58:43.940
I'm not here because I like you.

58:44.023 --> 58:45.733
I'm here because Argyris asked me to come.

58:45.817 --> 58:46.831
Mickey, sorry.

58:46.946 --> 58:48.421
- Fuck off.
- Manos, can I talk to you for a minute?

58:48.499 --> 58:49.571
What you want to talk about, Argyris?

58:49.655 --> 58:53.534
Did you bring me here so this fucking
Alabama cowboy can make fun of me?

58:54.284 --> 58:56.870
I really apologize, in two hours
you're gonna have what you need.

58:56.954 --> 58:58.205
A good track, in two
hours with this asshole?

58:58.539 --> 59:00.082
Don't worry, you'll have it.

59:06.254 --> 59:07.338
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:07.422 --> 59:09.466
There's a reservation under Aspa Karra?

59:09.549 --> 59:10.425
Yep.

59:10.508 --> 59:11.342
This side.

59:13.344 --> 59:14.929
Aspa, hi. I'm Chloe.

59:16.723 --> 59:17.599
Nice to meet you.

59:21.644 --> 59:23.730
Look at you.

59:23.813 --> 59:25.315
You're at his age, aren't you?

59:26.691 --> 59:28.610
I'm older, actually.

59:28.693 --> 59:29.527
That's funny.

59:30.612 --> 59:31.488
Why funny?

59:32.530 --> 59:34.032
Should we order?

59:34.115 --> 59:34.949
Sure.

59:38.286 --> 59:39.287
After you.

59:39.370 --> 59:40.497
No, go ahead.

59:40.580 --> 59:41.414
I insist.

59:43.917 --> 59:46.461
- Ice tea for me please.
- Same for me please.

59:46.545 --> 59:48.088
Thank you.

59:49.714 --> 59:51.090
- So...
- So...

59:52.467 --> 59:54.177
Am I meeting Mickey's
attorney or his girlfriend?

59:54.260 --> 59:55.970
Oh, he's not a client.

59:56.054 --> 59:57.347
Why isn't he here?

59:57.430 --> 59:59.057
I asked him not to come.

59:59.140 --> 1:00:00.433
That's a great idea.

1:00:00.517 --> 1:00:02.936
You knew he would do
something stupid, didn't you?

1:00:04.521 --> 1:00:06.105
Aspa, I know this is difficult

1:00:07.565 --> 1:00:09.776
but Mickey really wants a
relationship with his son.

1:00:09.859 --> 1:00:10.985
- Oh, does he?
- Yes.

1:00:11.069 --> 1:00:12.403
- And you know about it?
- Yes, I know that.

1:00:12.487 --> 1:00:13.321
I know him.

1:00:13.404 --> 1:00:14.823
You know nothing.

1:00:14.906 --> 1:00:15.824
You don't know what you're doing,

1:00:15.907 --> 1:00:17.242
you don't know where you are.

1:00:19.244 --> 1:00:22.330
Mickey can't be bothered to
learn one single word in Greek

1:00:22.413 --> 1:00:25.083
to communicate with his own son.

1:00:25.166 --> 1:00:27.085
So he has to rely on Hector's English.

1:00:28.586 --> 1:00:32.924
Look, that was then, and this is now.

1:00:33.007 --> 1:00:34.801
I'm here because I...

1:00:34.884 --> 1:00:35.969
- Look-
- Mickey is not the same

1:00:36.052 --> 1:00:36.886
as he was six years ago.

1:00:36.970 --> 1:00:38.138
Mickey is a baby.

1:00:39.264 --> 1:00:40.306
He's a little boy.

1:00:42.267 --> 1:00:43.726
Will you be happy with that?

1:00:43.810 --> 1:00:46.146
I don't need to talk to you
what I'm gonna be happy with.

1:00:46.229 --> 1:00:47.856
It's so fucking Greek.

1:00:47.939 --> 1:00:52.569
It reminds me of the Aegean
sea and Athenian women rising...

1:00:52.652 --> 1:00:56.197
And I see the corn, I see my grandmother

1:00:56.281 --> 1:00:57.532
coming out of the grave!

1:00:57.615 --> 1:00:59.701
And so but the Greek is there.

1:00:59.784 --> 1:01:01.703
And he's like playing the flute

1:01:01.786 --> 1:01:05.290
and eating the fucking
souvlaki and taking humus.

1:01:05.373 --> 1:01:06.916
No, humus is not Greek, man.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.710
- Humus is not Greek.
- Then tahini.

1:01:08.793 --> 1:01:10.336
- Is tahini?
- Yeah, tahini, yeah, yeah.

1:01:10.420 --> 1:01:11.629
- Tahini is Greek.
- Hey.

1:01:11.713 --> 1:01:12.881
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:01:12.964 --> 1:01:13.798
Hi.

1:01:13.882 --> 1:01:15.717
Hi. How was it?

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:18.011
Yeah, she's young, beautiful.

1:01:19.179 --> 1:01:20.263
She's fucking angry.

1:01:20.346 --> 1:01:21.723
Well, of course she's angry.

1:01:21.806 --> 1:01:23.892
She saw you, look how beautiful you are.

1:01:23.975 --> 1:01:25.143
Did you do the food?

1:01:26.644 --> 1:01:27.479
I have a plan.

1:01:28.813 --> 1:01:30.023
So you didn't make the food?

1:01:30.106 --> 1:01:32.025
Because I have a plan,
I'm gonna surprise you.

1:01:32.108 --> 1:01:34.986
All I asked you to do was
make the fucking food, Mickey.

1:01:35.945 --> 1:01:36.779
Okay.

1:02:31.167 --> 1:02:32.085
Can I help you?

1:02:32.168 --> 1:02:34.462
It's delivery for Mickey.

1:02:35.630 --> 1:02:37.173
Okay, thank you.

1:02:38.133 --> 1:02:39.300
How much is that?

1:02:39.384 --> 1:02:41.302
It's 52.60.

1:02:41.386 --> 1:02:42.220
One second.

1:02:43.972 --> 1:02:46.766
This was your plan, to order in food?

1:02:48.726 --> 1:02:49.644
Here you...

1:02:52.063 --> 1:02:54.482
Falafel, souvlaki.

1:02:55.817 --> 1:02:57.277
Sushi.

1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:58.403
It's good, right?

1:02:58.486 --> 1:03:01.281
- It's good.
- Yeah, some more sushi.

1:03:02.323 --> 1:03:04.117
Hey, are you good?

1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:05.994
- Yeah, I mean...
- Come on, it's funny.

1:03:06.077 --> 1:03:07.245
Really, is it though?

1:03:07.328 --> 1:03:08.413
Yeah.

1:03:08.496 --> 1:03:09.497
You know, it's real.

1:03:10.707 --> 1:03:13.042
It's like we don't care,
but we care, that kind.

1:03:13.126 --> 1:03:14.752
Yeah, I care.

1:03:14.836 --> 1:03:16.004
I know.

1:03:16.087 --> 1:03:17.255
That's good.

1:03:17.338 --> 1:03:19.466
Yeah, it's not for now, Argyris.

1:03:19.549 --> 1:03:20.633
Yeah, okay.

1:03:20.717 --> 1:03:22.594
- Now just...
- Very good that.

1:03:22.677 --> 1:03:23.761
Oh my God.

1:03:23.845 --> 1:03:25.680
Thank you so much for coming.

1:03:25.763 --> 1:03:27.849
I didn't know if it was a birthday party.

1:03:27.932 --> 1:03:29.100
Should I bring a present?

1:03:29.184 --> 1:03:30.935
Yeah, we're calling it a pointless party

1:03:31.019 --> 1:03:33.688
because there isn't any point to it.

1:03:33.771 --> 1:03:35.190
But we just wanted
everyone to meet, you know?

1:03:35.273 --> 1:03:37.358
But it's great to give parties.

1:03:37.442 --> 1:03:38.902
No one throws parties any longer.

1:03:38.985 --> 1:03:40.403
That's exactly what we said.

1:03:40.487 --> 1:03:43.031
- No!
- So, this is home.

1:03:43.114 --> 1:03:45.825
So, you're not house sitting?

1:03:45.909 --> 1:03:47.243
No, this is Mickey's...

1:03:47.327 --> 1:03:48.244
This is Mickey.

1:03:48.328 --> 1:03:50.121
- Mickey, this is Elli.
- Hi!

1:03:50.205 --> 1:03:51.414
Nice to meet you.

1:03:51.498 --> 1:03:52.582
Nice to meet you.

1:03:52.665 --> 1:03:53.666
You want a falafel?

1:03:54.876 --> 1:03:55.710
I'll have one later.

1:03:55.794 --> 1:03:57.295
- Okay.
- Great.

1:03:57.378 --> 1:03:59.422
- Yeah, so that's Mickey.
- So that's your boyfriend?

1:03:59.506 --> 1:04:00.381
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:04:00.465 --> 1:04:01.549
So are you still in Kolonaki?

1:04:01.633 --> 1:04:03.551
No, we moved to the northern suburbs.

1:04:03.635 --> 1:04:04.886
We?

1:04:04.969 --> 1:04:06.554
Kostas and I.

1:04:06.638 --> 1:04:07.722
My fiancé.

1:04:07.806 --> 1:04:11.392
Oh my God! That is a rock.

1:04:11.476 --> 1:04:13.436
- Wow!
- No, it's great.

1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:14.896
Oh, congratulations, I'm so happy.

1:04:14.979 --> 1:04:16.105
Thank you, Chloe.

1:04:16.189 --> 1:04:17.899
Well, I wish you the same, you know?

1:04:17.982 --> 1:04:19.067
Oh well.

1:04:19.150 --> 1:04:20.401
Let's go get a drink.

1:04:20.485 --> 1:04:22.320
Yes, I need a drink.

1:04:25.657 --> 1:04:27.575
Hey, what are you doing, man?

1:04:27.659 --> 1:04:28.910
I ordered this one.

1:04:28.993 --> 1:04:30.995
Nobody ordered, it's a buffet, you share.

1:04:31.079 --> 1:04:33.081
Oh, it's okay, this is good for me.

1:04:33.164 --> 1:04:33.998
Come on.

1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:38.503
- Hey, Mickey!
- Hey, wow.

1:04:38.586 --> 1:04:39.587
Look at you.

1:04:39.671 --> 1:04:40.672
Got a little beer.

1:04:40.755 --> 1:04:42.132
Looking good, looking good.

1:04:42.215 --> 1:04:44.509
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:04:50.641 --> 1:04:52.100
What is little Argyris doing here?

1:04:53.519 --> 1:04:56.939
Are you having a poo? A little shit?

1:04:58.774 --> 1:05:01.568
Look at this cute boy taking a dump!

1:05:01.652 --> 1:05:05.989
Come on don't be an asshole,
leave it. My mom framed it.

1:05:06.073 --> 1:05:08.867
Come on man, leave it!

1:05:09.492 --> 1:05:12.036
It's great that you put together, you know,

1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:13.746
his people, your people.

1:05:13.830 --> 1:05:14.956
It's really fun.

1:05:15.039 --> 1:05:16.249
I wanna introduce you to somebody.

1:05:16.332 --> 1:05:17.208
Excuse me for just a second.

1:05:17.292 --> 1:05:18.710
- Oh, okay.
- Come with me.

1:05:19.878 --> 1:05:22.589
So, you guys are both from London.

1:05:22.672 --> 1:05:24.090
So, I thought I should introduce you.

1:05:24.174 --> 1:05:25.467
Johnny, Tim. Tim, Johnny.

1:05:25.550 --> 1:05:26.968
Hey Johnny, how are you, man?

1:05:27.051 --> 1:05:28.303
- Good.
- Can I get you a drink?

1:05:28.386 --> 1:05:29.804
Ah, do you have juice?

1:05:29.888 --> 1:05:31.222
- Orange?
- Is it fresh?

1:05:31.306 --> 1:05:32.140
- Yes.
- Okay, great.

1:05:32.223 --> 1:05:33.391
Okay.

1:05:33.475 --> 1:05:35.477
So yeah, where are you from in London?

1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:36.436
Dagenham.

1:05:36.519 --> 1:05:37.854
All right, so not kind of...

1:05:39.022 --> 1:05:39.856
Yeah.

1:05:39.939 --> 1:05:40.815
London too, huh?

1:05:40.899 --> 1:05:42.442
Well, I mean, Holland Park.

1:05:42.525 --> 1:05:43.693
But I'm barely there.

1:05:43.776 --> 1:05:45.320
Kind of spending a lot of time here.

1:05:45.403 --> 1:05:46.488
Oh, what are you doing here?

1:05:46.571 --> 1:05:47.739
I'm doing a startup.

1:05:47.822 --> 1:05:48.656
Okay.

1:05:48.740 --> 1:05:51.117
It's called Your Home.

1:05:51.201 --> 1:05:54.037
It's sort of housing solution
for the global citizen.

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:55.830
So places like this, you just get in,

1:05:55.914 --> 1:06:00.001
rip these places out and make these cool,

1:06:00.084 --> 1:06:01.628
quite functional pods.

1:06:01.711 --> 1:06:04.214
Well, we're trapped in
this bar in Switzerland

1:06:04.297 --> 1:06:06.174
because it was like six
feet of snow outside.

1:06:06.257 --> 1:06:07.175
Oh, yeah!

1:06:08.593 --> 1:06:13.014
You guys, you put like
200 francs into the jukebox

1:06:13.097 --> 1:06:17.101
and played "Last Christmas"
on repeat 100 times.

1:06:17.185 --> 1:06:20.021
- That's so embarrassing.
- I love that song.

1:06:20.104 --> 1:06:22.357
They were so fucking wasted, you know.

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:24.943
And Christos, you know, he threw...

1:06:26.694 --> 1:06:28.071
He's a good guy, that guy.

1:06:28.154 --> 1:06:30.865
He threw down 3,000 francs
on the table, you know?

1:06:30.949 --> 1:06:33.535
And everybody was doing shots.

1:06:33.618 --> 1:06:35.245
I don't remember.

1:06:35.328 --> 1:06:37.872
And he looks very, very nice.

1:06:37.956 --> 1:06:39.165
Yeah, he's a really good guy.

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:40.792
He is. It's fine.

1:06:40.875 --> 1:06:42.001
You want a drink or not?

1:06:42.085 --> 1:06:44.254
Yes, I would like a vodka please.

1:06:44.337 --> 1:06:45.672
Sure.

1:06:45.755 --> 1:06:47.173
Dude, it's fucking
disgusting what you're doing

1:06:47.257 --> 1:06:48.591
and you should be ashamed
of yourself, seriously.

1:06:48.675 --> 1:06:49.843
I should be ashamed of myself?

1:06:49.926 --> 1:06:51.469
What do you do? What do
you do with your life?

1:06:51.553 --> 1:06:53.388
Mate, I left London 'cause London

1:06:53.471 --> 1:06:55.181
was like fucking ridiculously expensive,

1:06:55.265 --> 1:06:56.307
I couldn't afford to live there anymore-

1:06:56.391 --> 1:06:57.225
- Because you don't have a job, probably.

1:06:57.308 --> 1:06:58.143
I guess you don't work.

1:06:58.226 --> 1:06:59.769
Mate, you're a fucking cock.

1:06:59.853 --> 1:07:00.728
Oh, okay.

1:07:02.522 --> 1:07:03.731
Cheers, mate.

1:07:03.815 --> 1:07:06.025
Wow, I'm so glad that went so well.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.361
- That's your juice.
- Thank you so much.

1:07:08.444 --> 1:07:10.280
You know, it's funny,
like people always do that.

1:07:10.363 --> 1:07:13.616
"Oh, you're from London"
kind of like when you're gay,

1:07:13.700 --> 1:07:15.743
like, "Oh, hey, meet my gay friend."

1:07:15.827 --> 1:07:17.871
Oh, you're such a dick.

1:07:17.954 --> 1:07:20.165
Wow, okay.

1:07:20.248 --> 1:07:21.916
You wanna come and have some food with me?

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.710
- Sure.
- Sure, let's do that.

1:07:23.793 --> 1:07:25.712
- Really nice to meet you.
- Okay.

1:07:27.088 --> 1:07:29.090
It's like having 100%
of your daily nutrients

1:07:29.174 --> 1:07:30.842
for less than 800 calories.

1:07:30.925 --> 1:07:33.094
And it's raw and it's vegan.

1:07:33.178 --> 1:07:34.429
For 300 Euros?

1:07:38.516 --> 1:07:39.392
Guys, hey.

1:07:41.519 --> 1:07:42.812
Have you met these guys?

1:07:42.896 --> 1:07:46.983
This is Miltos, Orpheus,
Dimitrios, Prometheus and Greg.

1:07:48.318 --> 1:07:50.695
- Are you making fun of me?
- This is Stephanie.

1:07:50.778 --> 1:07:53.114
No, no, no, Stephanie.

1:07:53.198 --> 1:07:55.283
Where are you from, Stephanie?

1:07:55.366 --> 1:07:56.951
Athens, you fucking moron.

1:07:59.370 --> 1:08:01.289
Oh, you're a bit aggressive, Stephanie.

1:08:01.372 --> 1:08:02.582
Where from Athens?

1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:04.251
Papagou, mate.

1:08:04.334 --> 1:08:07.004
So what's with the accent?

1:08:07.378 --> 1:08:09.506
Because I have the ability and you don't.

1:08:09.589 --> 1:08:11.090
Sorry, baby.

1:08:11.174 --> 1:08:14.636
I'm speaking English to an
American because it's polite.

1:08:14.719 --> 1:08:17.095
Same reason I don't turn up like a shit

1:08:17.180 --> 1:08:18.305
in fucking cargo shorts.

1:08:18.389 --> 1:08:20.140
Sorry, pussycat. Sorry.

1:08:20.225 --> 1:08:21.810
Are they your friends?

1:08:21.893 --> 1:08:23.978
- Are they your friends?
- He is a shit, he is a shit.

1:08:24.062 --> 1:08:26.898
- Good for you.
- Bye bye, bye bye!

1:08:31.402 --> 1:08:32.278
Oh, fuck.

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.912
Argyris, what the fuck are you doing, man?

1:08:41.996 --> 1:08:43.832
You shit in your pants, do you know that?

1:08:43.915 --> 1:08:45.500
You shit in your pants.

1:08:45.582 --> 1:08:46.709
What?

1:08:46.792 --> 1:08:48.127
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh fuck!

1:08:48.211 --> 1:08:49.379
Get up.

1:08:49.462 --> 1:08:50.839
What the fuck did you
drink for fuck's sake?

1:08:50.921 --> 1:08:52.549
- Oh shit.
- Fuck.

1:08:52.631 --> 1:08:54.591
Shit. Hold on, hold on.

1:08:57.970 --> 1:08:58.805
Oh.

1:09:00.932 --> 1:09:04.394
You know, I've gotta
tell you, Manos texted.

1:09:04.477 --> 1:09:07.939
They hated the song, they said it's shit.

1:09:12.569 --> 1:09:13.403
Awesome.

1:09:16.865 --> 1:09:18.283
You almost got my drink.

1:09:18.366 --> 1:09:19.492
- I'm sorry. Almost.
- Almost.

1:09:19.576 --> 1:09:21.368
Cheers, Stephanie.

1:09:21.452 --> 1:09:22.370
Yeah, Stephanie.

1:09:22.453 --> 1:09:23.371
Bottoms up.

1:09:25.332 --> 1:09:27.584
- What are you drinking, Stephanie?
- Gin Tonic. Wanna try?

1:09:27.667 --> 1:09:29.252
No, no.

1:09:29.336 --> 1:09:30.879
Could it be Jizz Tonic?

1:09:32.548 --> 1:09:34.633
Maybe a Penis Colada?

1:09:35.384 --> 1:09:37.845
Don't worry if you find
anything funny in it.

1:09:37.928 --> 1:09:40.848
It's probably just angel hair...

1:09:44.309 --> 1:09:45.602
Oh my God!

1:09:45.685 --> 1:09:46.560
Oh my God!

1:09:46.644 --> 1:09:48.104
- Stephanie!
- What?

1:09:52.317 --> 1:09:53.568
- What happened?
- What's going on?

1:09:53.651 --> 1:09:56.696
- Are you okay?
- Oh my God, what happened?

1:09:56.779 --> 1:09:58.323
Guys, what did you do?

1:09:58.406 --> 1:10:01.534
They put something in my drink.

1:10:01.618 --> 1:10:02.952
Guys, come on!

1:10:03.870 --> 1:10:05.497
I'm gonna fucking sue you.

1:10:05.580 --> 1:10:06.706
Thank you, guys. Bye.

1:10:06.789 --> 1:10:09.417
Thank you so much for coming. Bye.

1:10:10.502 --> 1:10:11.920
Oh my God.

1:10:12.003 --> 1:10:13.838
That could not have gone worse.

1:10:47.997 --> 1:10:48.873
Oh, fuck.

1:10:50.792 --> 1:10:52.502
This is, it's so hot.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:54.879
It's okay.

1:11:38.256 --> 1:11:39.757
How do you feel?

1:11:41.885 --> 1:11:42.844
Don't worry.

1:11:42.927 --> 1:11:45.180
It will be over soon.

1:11:45.263 --> 1:11:46.639
We'll talk later.

1:12:41.611 --> 1:12:43.947
You will be experiencing some cramps.

1:12:44.030 --> 1:12:45.573
- Yeah.
- That's to be expected.

1:12:45.657 --> 1:12:46.491
Okay.

1:12:46.574 --> 1:12:47.867
- Don't worry.
- Oh yeah.

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:49.994
And try to take it easy the next days.

1:12:51.830 --> 1:12:52.789
Yeah, I'll try.

1:12:54.332 --> 1:12:55.166
Do you smoke?

1:12:56.626 --> 1:12:57.502
Yes.

1:12:57.585 --> 1:12:58.795
Can I have a cigarette?

1:12:58.878 --> 1:13:01.089
In here? 'cause it's not allowed.

1:13:01.172 --> 1:13:02.173
Thank you.

1:13:07.053 --> 1:13:07.887
Thank you.

1:13:15.228 --> 1:13:16.354
Fuck.

1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:09.491
Careful, it's really hot.

1:14:09.574 --> 1:14:10.575
Thank you.

1:14:12.118 --> 1:14:12.952
Thanks.

1:14:18.416 --> 1:14:20.502
So they didn't say what it was?

1:14:20.585 --> 1:14:22.629
Well, it's like a stomach flu.

1:14:23.588 --> 1:14:25.340
It's what they told me.

1:14:29.093 --> 1:14:30.303
What time is she coming?

1:14:31.429 --> 1:14:32.472
A couple of hours.

1:14:32.555 --> 1:14:33.389
Okay.

1:14:34.432 --> 1:14:35.266
I'll be alright.

1:14:37.393 --> 1:14:38.937
I'm sorry you feel shitty.

1:14:41.731 --> 1:14:43.149
You still look good though.

1:14:57.705 --> 1:15:00.542
I don't actually know
what this window is for.

1:15:01.835 --> 1:15:03.044
But it's safe.

1:15:06.756 --> 1:15:08.550
I'm not here to inspect, it's not my job,

1:15:08.633 --> 1:15:12.595
but my client, Ms. Karras,
insisted to make sure

1:15:12.679 --> 1:15:15.932
that Hector will spend
time in a safe environment.

1:15:16.015 --> 1:15:17.600
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah, of course.

1:15:17.684 --> 1:15:19.352
I know the whole situation
is awkward, but...

1:15:19.435 --> 1:15:20.895
No, of course, it's fine.

1:15:20.979 --> 1:15:22.063
Absolutely.

1:15:22.147 --> 1:15:23.356
- Should I show you his room?
- Oh yeah.

1:15:23.439 --> 1:15:24.732
His room is over here. Yeah.

1:15:24.816 --> 1:15:25.692
This way.

1:15:25.775 --> 1:15:26.609
You both live here?

1:15:26.693 --> 1:15:27.569
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:15:27.652 --> 1:15:28.570
For how long?

1:15:28.653 --> 1:15:29.988
- A few years.
- Six months.

1:15:30.071 --> 1:15:31.990
I moved in six months ago.

1:15:33.533 --> 1:15:35.201
So, this is...

1:15:35.285 --> 1:15:36.119
Yeah.

1:15:37.203 --> 1:15:38.621
It's nice.

1:15:39.831 --> 1:15:41.249
You understand that Hector's mother

1:15:41.332 --> 1:15:44.210
has assigned guardianship
and visitation rights

1:15:44.294 --> 1:15:45.211
to the both of you.

1:15:47.172 --> 1:15:48.590
Oh.

1:15:48.673 --> 1:15:52.177
Both of you, as a couple
will be legally allowed

1:15:52.260 --> 1:15:54.637
to take unsupervised custody of Hector

1:15:54.721 --> 1:15:58.933
for the allotted time period
stated on the documents.

1:15:59.017 --> 1:16:00.477
- And...
- Okay.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:03.521
So we just have to be there
at the same time to see him.

1:16:03.605 --> 1:16:04.898
- Yes.
- Okay.

1:16:04.981 --> 1:16:08.485
And that's the only way we can have access?

1:16:08.568 --> 1:16:11.571
Well, it can be overturned
on appeal from either party,

1:16:11.654 --> 1:16:13.948
but provided you remain in a stable

1:16:14.032 --> 1:16:15.950
and committed relationship.

1:16:16.034 --> 1:16:17.619
Do you consider yourselves being

1:16:17.702 --> 1:16:20.121
in a stable and committed relationship?

1:16:20.205 --> 1:16:22.540
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course, yes.

1:16:22.624 --> 1:16:23.458
Great.

1:16:24.626 --> 1:16:25.460
Nice room.

1:16:25.543 --> 1:16:26.753
Yeah, it's great.

1:16:26.836 --> 1:16:28.755
So yeah, anyway, there's...

1:16:30.590 --> 1:16:31.883
There's just this one other room here.

1:16:31.966 --> 1:16:32.967
This is the...

1:16:33.051 --> 1:16:34.135
It's your bedroom?

1:16:34.219 --> 1:16:35.345
Bedroom.

1:16:35.428 --> 1:16:36.763
And then that's it.

1:16:36.846 --> 1:16:38.223
That's pretty much it.

1:16:38.306 --> 1:16:39.307
Thank you very much.

1:16:39.390 --> 1:16:40.225
Yeah.

1:16:41.226 --> 1:16:42.477
You're welcome.

1:16:52.362 --> 1:16:54.614
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.

1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:58.201
Just okay?

1:16:59.911 --> 1:17:01.204
That's not good enough.

1:17:01.287 --> 1:17:03.164
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1:17:03.248 --> 1:17:05.667
I'm sorry, I can't do it now.

1:17:07.794 --> 1:17:08.837
I'm sorry.

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:11.339
It's okay. It's fine.

1:17:11.422 --> 1:17:14.509
I just wanna make sure you're
feeling good, that's all.

1:17:14.592 --> 1:17:15.426
Yeah.

1:17:16.261 --> 1:17:17.095
Okay.

1:17:45.081 --> 1:17:46.374
Hi. Chloe Gains.

1:17:46.457 --> 1:17:47.459
Hello, welcome.

1:17:47.542 --> 1:17:49.043
Chloe Gains.

1:17:49.127 --> 1:17:50.295
- Yes, you're right here.
- Great.

1:17:50.378 --> 1:17:51.921
This gentleman is your plus one?

1:17:52.005 --> 1:17:52.881
Mickey, yes.

1:17:52.964 --> 1:17:53.923
Yeah, plus one.

1:17:54.007 --> 1:17:54.841
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your night.

1:17:54.924 --> 1:17:58.428
Thank you.

1:17:58.511 --> 1:18:00.138
Hey guys, smile.

1:18:03.308 --> 1:18:05.477
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:18:09.105 --> 1:18:10.273
Hi guys. Okay.

1:18:18.907 --> 1:18:21.201
- Maybe we can like...
- Hey, guys.

1:18:21.284 --> 1:18:22.535
Wow, hey, how are you?

1:18:22.619 --> 1:18:24.329
- Hey.
- Perfect.

1:18:24.412 --> 1:18:25.997
What's up, you look fucking miserable.

1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:27.248
Well, it was a long journey.

1:18:27.332 --> 1:18:28.249
How was the ceremony?

1:18:28.333 --> 1:18:29.626
Oh, so good!

1:18:29.709 --> 1:18:31.336
There was this girl, Elli's niece.

1:18:31.419 --> 1:18:32.295
She sang a song.

1:18:32.378 --> 1:18:34.214
She was fucking beautiful.

1:18:34.297 --> 1:18:35.673
And her voice made me hard.

1:18:35.757 --> 1:18:38.426
I sat in the church with a
huge boner, like, what the fuck!

1:18:38.510 --> 1:18:40.011
I wanna meet her but I
can't find her anywhere.

1:18:40.094 --> 1:18:42.472
Yeah, I'm gonna be sure to
tell her to stay away from you.

1:18:42.555 --> 1:18:44.098
As far away from you as possible.

1:18:44.182 --> 1:18:45.642
No.

1:18:45.725 --> 1:18:47.602
Oh, my friend is here.
One second, I'll be back.

1:18:47.685 --> 1:18:49.020
Where did you get that drink?

1:18:49.103 --> 1:18:51.022
There are people with trays
with champagne and shit

1:18:51.105 --> 1:18:51.940
all over the place.

1:18:52.023 --> 1:18:53.024
Come on, I gotta get one.

1:18:55.193 --> 1:18:56.528
We really miss you.

1:18:56.611 --> 1:18:58.071
I know, and I miss you too.

1:18:58.154 --> 1:18:59.531
We talk about you all the time.

1:18:59.614 --> 1:19:01.115
All the girls they said
to me "Where is Chloe?"

1:19:01.199 --> 1:19:02.617
I say I don't know.

1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:03.910
You know what it's like.

1:19:03.993 --> 1:19:05.245
You meet somebody and
you go into the bubble

1:19:05.328 --> 1:19:07.539
and all you can see is them, but I'm good.

1:19:07.622 --> 1:19:08.832
I'm okay.

1:19:08.915 --> 1:19:09.874
Okay.

1:19:09.958 --> 1:19:11.835
It's new but it's good.

1:19:11.918 --> 1:19:13.378
He's kind to you?

1:19:13.461 --> 1:19:15.380
Yeah, he's great.

1:19:15.463 --> 1:19:17.090
Okay. Then I like him.

1:19:17.173 --> 1:19:18.299
Yeah.

1:19:18.383 --> 1:19:20.426
I had to step out for a bit.

1:19:20.510 --> 1:19:22.470
You know, it was a lot.

1:19:22.554 --> 1:19:24.764
What happened with Christos was a lot.

1:19:24.848 --> 1:19:26.641
What happened with
Christos is something else.

1:19:26.724 --> 1:19:27.934
Tonight, we'll have a lot of fun.

1:19:28.017 --> 1:19:28.852
A lot of fun.

1:19:28.935 --> 1:19:30.019
Yes.

1:19:30.103 --> 1:19:31.187
- Here's to that.
- Tonight, a lot of fun.

1:19:38.403 --> 1:19:39.904
Hey.

1:19:39.988 --> 1:19:40.822
Oh, hey.

1:19:41.823 --> 1:19:42.907
Here you are.

1:19:42.991 --> 1:19:44.284
How are you? Okay?

1:19:44.367 --> 1:19:45.743
- I'm good. How are you?
- Let me introduce you.

1:19:45.827 --> 1:19:48.413
This is, you remember
Anna that I told you about?

1:19:48.496 --> 1:19:49.831
And Virginia and Caterina.

1:19:49.914 --> 1:19:52.292
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1:19:52.375 --> 1:19:53.418
Nice to meet you.

1:19:53.501 --> 1:19:54.461
Are you okay?

1:19:54.544 --> 1:19:56.045
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1:19:56.129 --> 1:19:56.963
Yeah.

1:19:58.590 --> 1:19:59.507
I'm gonna be right here.

1:19:59.591 --> 1:20:00.675
Okay, I'll come and find you.

1:20:00.758 --> 1:20:02.177
I'll be around here.

1:20:02.260 --> 1:20:03.386
Okay.

1:20:03.470 --> 1:20:04.512
Mickey.

1:20:04.596 --> 1:20:05.638
Mickey, is that you?

1:20:08.099 --> 1:20:08.933
Mickey, right?

1:20:38.254 --> 1:20:39.631
Vodka soda, double.

1:20:39.714 --> 1:20:41.132
Yes, please.

1:20:41.216 --> 1:20:43.384
I am keeping a tight
hold of my drink tonight.

1:20:44.469 --> 1:20:45.553
Stephanie.

1:20:45.637 --> 1:20:46.554
How are you?

1:20:46.638 --> 1:20:47.806
Good. How are you doing?

1:20:47.889 --> 1:20:48.723
I'm fine.

1:20:50.934 --> 1:20:52.101
I'm glad you made it.

1:20:52.185 --> 1:20:54.562
I was always gonna make it.

1:20:55.730 --> 1:20:57.524
I think it's probably the first time

1:20:57.607 --> 1:20:59.776
they've seen each other
since they broke up.

1:21:02.362 --> 1:21:04.322
He has this way of...

1:21:04.405 --> 1:21:05.573
I don't know, gas lighting people.

1:21:05.657 --> 1:21:06.825
Do you know gas lighting?

1:21:07.992 --> 1:21:09.410
Yeah, I know what gas lighting is.

1:21:09.494 --> 1:21:11.871
Because of all the family
money and the connections,

1:21:11.955 --> 1:21:14.833
he thinks he can move people
wherever he wants them.

1:21:14.916 --> 1:21:16.292
After he and Chloe broke up,

1:21:16.376 --> 1:21:19.629
he set her up with this
big new job back in Chicago.

1:21:19.712 --> 1:21:20.713
Like it was nothing.

1:21:23.675 --> 1:21:25.760
So he got her a job, that's...

1:21:25.844 --> 1:21:26.678
That's nice.

1:21:31.015 --> 1:21:31.850
So...

1:21:34.769 --> 1:21:36.020
I'm here with someone.

1:21:36.938 --> 1:21:38.189
I'm very happy for you.

1:21:38.273 --> 1:21:40.525
I'm sure you are, I can tell.

1:21:40.608 --> 1:21:42.360
He's the reason I stayed in Athens.

1:21:44.779 --> 1:21:45.697
He is the reason?

1:21:48.491 --> 1:21:50.535
Just pure, innocent, romantic.

1:21:51.411 --> 1:21:53.079
Just love at first sight, right?

1:21:54.706 --> 1:21:55.582
It was, actually.

1:21:57.542 --> 1:21:59.544
So you were not picturing

1:21:59.627 --> 1:22:01.713
one of my biggest clients calling to ask me

1:22:01.796 --> 1:22:04.340
why their new hire had not shown up

1:22:04.424 --> 1:22:05.842
at her first day at work?

1:22:05.925 --> 1:22:08.136
I didn't wanna take a job
that you had arranged for me.

1:22:08.219 --> 1:22:09.053
Since when?

1:22:09.137 --> 1:22:10.305
What's that...

1:22:10.388 --> 1:22:11.806
I don't wanna be controlled by you.

1:22:11.890 --> 1:22:14.309
Stop doing that, I fucking
hate when you do that.

1:22:14.392 --> 1:22:15.351
Oh.

1:22:15.435 --> 1:22:16.603
Should you be drinking?

1:22:18.062 --> 1:22:20.440
My drinking is none of your
fucking business, Christos.

1:22:20.523 --> 1:22:21.399
We're finished.

1:22:22.484 --> 1:22:24.402
You need to stop embarrassing yourself.

1:22:25.904 --> 1:22:27.989
I'm embarrassing myself?

1:22:28.072 --> 1:22:28.907
Really?

1:22:28.990 --> 1:22:31.242
Embarrassing myself?

1:22:31.326 --> 1:22:32.410
Did you just say this?

1:22:34.370 --> 1:22:35.371
Look at you.

1:22:38.750 --> 1:22:40.877
Enjoy your night, Chloe.

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:41.795
Fuck you.

1:22:44.339 --> 1:22:47.258
Talk to me, bro, you look
like you're gonna kill someone.

1:22:51.095 --> 1:22:53.598
You're desperate to
blow this thing up, huh?

1:22:53.681 --> 1:22:54.766
'cause it's still good?

1:22:56.684 --> 1:22:58.728
And you take good things
and you turn them into shit.

1:22:58.812 --> 1:23:00.396
I've seen you do this.

1:23:01.648 --> 1:23:04.859
She loves you, and she makes you happy.

1:23:06.528 --> 1:23:07.987
And you fucking deserve this.

1:23:11.866 --> 1:23:13.827
Come on, say it. Say.

1:23:13.910 --> 1:23:17.956
Do you deserve it or not?

1:23:18.039 --> 1:23:19.249
Do you deserve it or not?

1:23:19.332 --> 1:23:20.458
I deserve it.

1:23:20.542 --> 1:23:22.252
Yes, you fucking deserve it.

1:23:22.335 --> 1:23:25.088
And you'd better fight for it and keep it.

1:23:25.171 --> 1:23:26.214
'cause it's the best fucking thing

1:23:26.297 --> 1:23:27.590
that ever happened to you.

1:23:28.967 --> 1:23:30.927
You either sort your shit out

1:23:31.010 --> 1:23:33.429
and decide you're worth
something to someone

1:23:34.889 --> 1:23:37.684
or you die sad and alone
and fucking perverted.

1:23:52.073 --> 1:23:53.449
Dammit!

1:24:29.819 --> 1:24:30.945
Come on.

1:24:31.029 --> 1:24:31.863
Come on.

1:24:31.946 --> 1:24:32.989
Ooh!

1:24:33.072 --> 1:24:34.449
That was fucking great.

1:24:34.532 --> 1:24:36.367
Can we give it up for
this lovely woman, please?

1:24:37.619 --> 1:24:38.995
Yes!

1:24:39.078 --> 1:24:41.831
What a lovely woman and this lovely couple,

1:24:41.915 --> 1:24:43.750
these two people...

1:24:45.251 --> 1:24:46.211
- What's your name?
- Loukas, Loukas.

1:24:46.294 --> 1:24:48.838
Ah, Loukas, what a man.

1:24:48.922 --> 1:24:49.756
So nice.

1:24:49.839 --> 1:24:51.508
Eleni is the name.

1:24:51.591 --> 1:24:54.052
Okay, good, are you having fun tonight?

1:24:54.135 --> 1:24:55.053
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1:24:55.136 --> 1:24:56.596
Do you trust each other?

1:24:56.679 --> 1:24:58.306
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's nice.

1:24:59.474 --> 1:25:01.142
Did you ask each other before you got here,

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:03.144
how many people you slept with?

1:25:03.228 --> 1:25:06.272
Whose dick she sucked
or anything like that...

1:25:06.356 --> 1:25:07.273
- Come on, buddy.
- Don't worry, Argyris.

1:25:07.357 --> 1:25:08.191
I got it.

1:25:08.274 --> 1:25:09.150
I'm so sorry, Loukas.

1:25:09.234 --> 1:25:10.443
I'm sorry, hold on, please.

1:25:10.527 --> 1:25:14.405
The point is the past is the past,

1:25:14.489 --> 1:25:17.951
and it's about the future, right?

1:25:18.034 --> 1:25:19.369
Right, Christos?

1:25:19.452 --> 1:25:20.537
Hey.

1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:22.247
It's somebody else's party, you know?

1:25:23.414 --> 1:25:25.250
Anyway, so it's not about the past.

1:25:25.333 --> 1:25:26.417
It's about the future.

1:25:27.877 --> 1:25:30.296
And when you meet someone
that you wanna die with,

1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:32.382
that's the person you gotta hang on to.

1:25:32.465 --> 1:25:33.883
And I don't wanna die alone,

1:25:33.967 --> 1:25:35.844
I wanna die with you, Chloe Gains.

1:25:36.970 --> 1:25:38.054
Okay?

1:25:38.138 --> 1:25:41.057
So, do you wanna die with me?

1:25:41.141 --> 1:25:42.350
Do you wanna...

1:25:42.433 --> 1:25:44.102
Hey, Chloe, look at me.

1:25:46.354 --> 1:25:47.522
You wanna be my future?

1:25:48.898 --> 1:25:51.818
- Mickey, stop.
- Would you be my wife?

1:25:51.901 --> 1:25:52.735
Come on.

1:25:53.903 --> 1:25:55.405
Come on.

1:25:55.488 --> 1:25:56.739
- Come on. No, no.
- Hey.

1:25:56.823 --> 1:25:59.117
- Please, come on.
- Hey.

1:26:00.493 --> 1:26:01.327
Fuck.

1:26:18.303 --> 1:26:21.139
So we just don't have a sink now?

1:26:21.222 --> 1:26:22.640
What?

1:26:22.724 --> 1:26:24.851
We don't have a sink now.

1:26:27.312 --> 1:26:29.939
I called the guy, he was
supposed to come yesterday.

1:26:30.023 --> 1:26:31.441
Baby, you have to call a professional.

1:26:31.524 --> 1:26:33.943
He is. He's a fucking
plumber, okay? It's fine.

1:26:34.027 --> 1:26:34.861
- He's gonna come today.
- It's been like this

1:26:34.944 --> 1:26:35.778
for three days.

1:26:35.862 --> 1:26:37.030
Don't start fucking with it

1:26:37.113 --> 1:26:38.239
unless you know what you're doing.

1:26:38.323 --> 1:26:40.742
I told you, just call someone, please.

1:26:40.825 --> 1:26:42.118
Calm down.

1:26:42.202 --> 1:26:43.244
- It's a fucking sink.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

1:26:43.328 --> 1:26:44.412
- The place is like-
- Relax.

1:26:44.496 --> 1:26:46.581
Don't tell me to fucking relax, Mickey.

1:26:46.664 --> 1:26:47.790
Hector arrives on Monday.

1:26:47.874 --> 1:26:49.083
- The place is in shit.
- So what?

1:26:49.167 --> 1:26:50.877
We're not gonna have to take him
into the fucking kitchen, okay?

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.420
He can go to his room.

1:26:52.504 --> 1:26:53.838
Oh, my God it's like living

1:26:53.922 --> 1:26:55.089
- with a fucking teenager.
- We'll go to the fucking park

1:26:55.173 --> 1:26:56.591
it's not a big deal.

1:26:56.674 --> 1:26:58.343
No, I will have to fix
it, like everything else.

1:27:18.363 --> 1:27:19.447
I'm sorry.

1:27:21.616 --> 1:27:23.368
I didn't mean to get so upset.

1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:31.417
I think I'm just scared.

1:27:36.673 --> 1:27:37.590
I'm scared.

1:27:40.135 --> 1:27:41.469
Well, I've had an idea.

1:27:44.055 --> 1:27:45.431
- Was it-
- I bought you this.

1:27:47.392 --> 1:27:49.853
It's a book of songs in Greek.

1:27:49.936 --> 1:27:53.481
But I thought we could learn a kid song.

1:27:55.359 --> 1:27:58.570
- And then we could get him to sing.
- Yeah?

1:28:00.071 --> 1:28:01.906
There's like one that's really famous.

1:28:03.408 --> 1:28:04.242
Here.

1:28:06.786 --> 1:28:07.620
Okay?

1:28:10.373 --> 1:28:11.249
Here, here.

1:28:14.043 --> 1:28:16.588
Okay.

1:28:27.724 --> 1:28:29.142
Yeah!

1:28:29.225 --> 1:28:30.518
- So...
- So...

1:28:30.602 --> 1:28:31.936
It's...

1:28:51.289 --> 1:28:56.294
So it's like, I had a love
and my love was like a cloud.

1:28:57.837 --> 1:29:00.173
- That sounds true.
- It's Greek.

1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:03.843
Okay, you play, you play.

1:29:03.927 --> 1:29:05.220
- Okay, so-
- Ready?

1:29:05.303 --> 1:29:06.513
What's this next part?

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:08.848
And then we do the chorus, is...

1:29:17.857 --> 1:29:19.400
I'm gonna get us a drink.

1:29:21.319 --> 1:29:22.654
You're so good.

1:30:04.863 --> 1:30:05.780
What a dummy!

1:30:10.118 --> 1:30:11.369
It's perfect.

1:30:12.620 --> 1:30:14.164
Here.

1:30:14.247 --> 1:30:16.082
Oh my God, are you serious?

1:30:16.166 --> 1:30:17.500
Yeah, why not?

1:30:19.502 --> 1:30:20.336
Yeah!

1:30:29.721 --> 1:30:31.556
There she is.

1:30:31.639 --> 1:30:34.309
My favorite person in the world!

1:30:35.977 --> 1:30:36.811
Yeah!

1:30:56.706 --> 1:30:57.957
You know what I wanna do?

1:30:58.041 --> 1:30:59.667
What do you wanna do?

1:30:59.751 --> 1:31:01.377
Can we go dance?

1:31:01.461 --> 1:31:03.546
We haven't been dancing in so long.

1:31:27.445 --> 1:31:28.530
This is pretty.

1:31:28.613 --> 1:31:29.447
Uh-huh.

1:31:30.990 --> 1:31:33.451
- It's nice.
- It's Christmas.

1:31:50.135 --> 1:31:50.969
Come on.

1:31:56.474 --> 1:31:57.517
Strict faces.

1:31:57.600 --> 1:31:59.811
- Don't say nothing.
- Okay.

1:31:59.894 --> 1:32:00.728
Hi.

1:32:04.691 --> 1:32:05.942
- Hi.

1:32:07.277 --> 1:32:09.195
- Welcome.
- Hi, hi, hi.

1:32:11.156 --> 1:32:13.367
Merry Christmas!

1:32:15.827 --> 1:32:16.703
Have fun.

1:32:16.786 --> 1:32:18.079
Thank you. Thank you.

1:32:20.665 --> 1:32:21.749
Wow, this is crazy.

1:32:21.833 --> 1:32:23.042
Hey.

1:32:23.126 --> 1:32:24.294
Hi.

1:32:24.377 --> 1:32:26.588
Can we get four shots of tequila?

1:32:26.671 --> 1:32:27.630
Shots of tequila.

1:32:27.714 --> 1:32:29.716
- Six of them.
- Six shots of tequila.

1:32:29.799 --> 1:32:31.509
Six, baby.

1:32:31.593 --> 1:32:32.719
- Sure?
- Yes.

1:32:32.802 --> 1:32:33.720
Alright, okay.

1:32:33.803 --> 1:32:35.263
It's our final weekend.

1:32:35.346 --> 1:32:38.391
Final weekend before being parents.

1:32:40.310 --> 1:32:41.436
Oh yeah.

1:32:41.519 --> 1:32:42.729
All right.

1:32:42.812 --> 1:32:44.522
- Okay, to whatever saints
- Oh my God.

1:32:44.606 --> 1:32:46.065
The last weekend.

1:32:49.194 --> 1:32:50.487
Fuck.

1:32:50.570 --> 1:32:51.988
Can I have a gin and tonic?

1:32:52.071 --> 1:32:55.074
Oh man, I could have been on
that goddam floor right now.

1:32:55.158 --> 1:32:56.618
I could have done the whole game

1:32:56.701 --> 1:32:59.245
and the thousands of
people, and the fucking...

1:33:00.371 --> 1:33:01.915
Can you get drugs?

1:33:01.998 --> 1:33:03.416
- Drugs?
- Can you get drugs?

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:05.043
- What do you mean drugs?
- Let's get some drugs.

1:33:05.126 --> 1:33:06.461
You don't do drugs.

1:33:06.544 --> 1:33:08.797
Yeah, but I wanna do some drugs now.

1:33:08.880 --> 1:33:09.964
What drugs?

1:33:10.048 --> 1:33:11.424
Just get some drugs.

1:33:11.508 --> 1:33:13.968
You can get some drugs
here, don't you know people?

1:33:14.052 --> 1:33:15.595
- Come on, get some-
- Yeah, I know people.

1:33:15.678 --> 1:33:17.639
Get some drugs. Get some drugs.

1:33:17.722 --> 1:33:18.640
Okay.

1:33:18.723 --> 1:33:20.433
Okay. I'll wait here.

1:33:20.517 --> 1:33:21.518
I'll wait here.

1:33:21.601 --> 1:33:23.353
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Okay, bye.

1:33:23.436 --> 1:33:25.522
- Stay right here.
- I'm here, I'm here.

1:33:27.690 --> 1:33:28.942
I don't...

1:33:29.025 --> 1:33:31.736
Yeah, but I don't know. Cocaine?

1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:32.904
Whatever you have.

1:33:34.739 --> 1:33:36.032
No, a gram?

1:33:36.115 --> 1:33:38.117
No, no, no, I need like...

1:33:38.201 --> 1:33:40.161
Never mind, never mind, never mind.

1:33:40.245 --> 1:33:41.162
Hey.

1:33:41.246 --> 1:33:42.747
Come outside.

1:33:42.831 --> 1:33:43.915
Where did you get it?

1:33:43.998 --> 1:33:45.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:33:45.583 --> 1:33:46.417
Come on.

1:33:46.501 --> 1:33:47.669
Where did you get the drugs?

1:33:47.752 --> 1:33:49.170
It doesn't matter. I got it from somewhere.

1:33:49.254 --> 1:33:50.171
- What are we doing?
- Come on, put it...

1:33:50.255 --> 1:33:52.006
- Little bit.
- How much?

1:33:52.090 --> 1:33:53.133
All of it, just fucking...

1:33:53.216 --> 1:33:54.717
No, I may need some for later.

1:33:54.801 --> 1:33:56.678
That's good, that's good.

1:33:56.761 --> 1:33:59.222
Oh my God, why have I
never done this before?

1:33:59.305 --> 1:34:00.348
You're gonna do the
one in the middle, okay?

1:34:00.431 --> 1:34:01.516
- Okay.
- It's a big one.

1:34:01.599 --> 1:34:02.725
- You're sure?
- I don't know.

1:34:02.809 --> 1:34:03.852
I've never done it before.

1:34:03.935 --> 1:34:06.187
- Okay.
- Okay. So just one...

1:34:06.271 --> 1:34:07.522
Okay.

1:34:07.605 --> 1:34:08.857
Go.

1:34:08.940 --> 1:34:11.526
- Okay, there you go.
- Fuck!

1:34:11.609 --> 1:34:12.527
You okay.

1:34:13.361 --> 1:34:14.195
Wow.

1:34:16.281 --> 1:34:17.448
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:34:17.532 --> 1:34:18.449
You want another one.
All right, that's good.

1:34:18.533 --> 1:34:19.367
Oh fuck!

1:34:20.451 --> 1:34:21.578
Oh my God.

1:34:21.661 --> 1:34:23.872

1:34:23.955 --> 1:34:25.415
Okay, let's go.

1:34:25.498 --> 1:34:30.503
Fuck.

1:34:44.100 --> 1:34:46.561
You're like a snowflake.

1:34:46.644 --> 1:34:48.229
What?

1:34:48.313 --> 1:34:51.316
You're like, white as a snowflake.

1:34:53.485 --> 1:34:55.820
Do you still find me sexy?

1:34:56.863 --> 1:34:57.697
Do you?

1:34:59.073 --> 1:35:01.910
You are the sexiest woman I know.

1:35:03.203 --> 1:35:04.037
You are.

1:35:26.434 --> 1:35:27.560
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1:35:27.644 --> 1:35:28.853
What's your name?

1:35:28.937 --> 1:35:30.480
Caterina. Yours?

1:35:30.563 --> 1:35:32.690
I'm Mickey, nice to meet you.

1:35:32.774 --> 1:35:34.275
- Hi, Mickey.
- Come on.

1:35:34.359 --> 1:35:37.070
It was really nice to meet you.

1:35:37.153 --> 1:35:38.655
What are you doing?

1:35:38.738 --> 1:35:40.865
Hey, you were dancing with the guy.

1:35:40.949 --> 1:35:42.116
What was I supposed to do?

1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:43.159
One second.

1:35:44.118 --> 1:35:46.120
Don't worry about him.

1:35:47.038 --> 1:35:48.039
It's okay.

1:35:50.875 --> 1:35:52.335
What's going on?

1:35:52.418 --> 1:35:53.670
Come on, piss off.

1:35:53.753 --> 1:35:55.421
Guys, don't fight. Don't fight.

1:35:55.505 --> 1:35:56.339
Hey, hey.

1:35:56.422 --> 1:35:57.298
What?

1:36:00.885 --> 1:36:02.053
You're a.

1:36:02.137 --> 1:36:03.263
That's what you are.

1:36:03.346 --> 1:36:07.809
You're a.

1:36:09.727 --> 1:36:11.646
Hold on, wait a second.

1:36:13.439 --> 1:36:14.566
Okay, okay.

1:36:14.649 --> 1:36:16.651
Okay, give me a second.

1:36:16.734 --> 1:36:18.153
I have the leather jacket.

1:36:18.236 --> 1:36:19.320
It's Christmas.

1:36:19.404 --> 1:36:20.488
It's fucking Christmas.

1:36:20.572 --> 1:36:23.074
No wait, he didn't do anything!

1:36:23.158 --> 1:36:24.492
Mickey!

1:36:24.576 --> 1:36:27.036
He didn't do anything!

1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:28.371
Okay,

1:36:28.454 --> 1:36:31.833
and now I'm gonna have a
cigarette because I can,

1:36:31.916 --> 1:36:33.126
because it's Greek.

1:36:33.209 --> 1:36:34.043
Oh, let's go.

1:36:34.127 --> 1:36:35.211
Let's go. Let's go.

1:36:35.295 --> 1:36:36.629
Don't! Let's go.

1:36:48.725 --> 1:36:49.767
- Oh shit.
- Oh fuck.

1:36:56.441 --> 1:36:57.275
Oh my God!

1:36:58.276 --> 1:37:00.195
We should stop and have sex.

1:37:00.278 --> 1:37:01.654
I wanna have sex with you.

1:37:01.738 --> 1:37:03.823
- Really?
- I wanna have sex right now.

1:37:03.907 --> 1:37:05.909
I want you to fuck me.

1:37:05.992 --> 1:37:06.826
I'll fuck you.

1:37:08.536 --> 1:37:10.205
Come on, let's stop somewhere.

1:37:10.288 --> 1:37:11.789
Let's fuck somewhere.

1:37:37.023 --> 1:37:37.857
Wait, wait.

1:37:37.941 --> 1:37:39.484
Oh gosh, my heels.

1:37:41.444 --> 1:37:43.363
I got you, I got you.

1:37:44.864 --> 1:37:46.241
Fuck, this way.

1:37:46.324 --> 1:37:47.200
This way.

1:38:07.554 --> 1:38:08.388
Fuck.

1:38:13.309 --> 1:38:14.144
Come on.

1:38:20.525 --> 1:38:21.359
Hey.

1:38:23.695 --> 1:38:25.238
Hey, what's wrong?

1:38:25.321 --> 1:38:26.156
What's wrong?

1:38:26.239 --> 1:38:27.532
I'm so sorry.

1:38:27.615 --> 1:38:28.449
What?

1:38:31.286 --> 1:38:32.745
What's going on?

1:38:32.829 --> 1:38:34.497
I love you.

1:38:34.581 --> 1:38:37.041
I love you so, so much.

1:38:37.125 --> 1:38:39.002
I love you too.

1:38:39.085 --> 1:38:40.336
I love you too.

1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:43.798
I have to tell you something.

1:38:43.882 --> 1:38:46.342
I have to tell you something.

1:38:49.596 --> 1:38:53.266
I was pregnant and I'm
not pregnant anymore.

1:38:59.981 --> 1:39:02.484
I had an abortion and it...

1:39:02.567 --> 1:39:04.277
I didn't tell you.

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:05.403
I'm so sorry.

1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:11.826
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

1:39:11.910 --> 1:39:14.162
I didn't know you and I was not sure.

1:39:14.245 --> 1:39:16.539
- It's okay.
- I thought you wouldn't want-

1:39:16.623 --> 1:39:17.749
- It's okay.

1:39:17.832 --> 1:39:18.708
It's okay.

1:39:18.791 --> 1:39:20.835
What do you mean it's okay?

1:39:20.919 --> 1:39:22.086
Come on.

1:39:22.170 --> 1:39:24.631
I don't understand why you're not upset.

1:39:24.714 --> 1:39:25.965
You can be mad.

1:39:26.966 --> 1:39:29.677
- I'm not mad.
- Why? Why not?

1:39:29.761 --> 1:39:32.180
Because it doesn't fucking matter.

1:39:32.263 --> 1:39:33.515
I mean we just...

1:39:33.598 --> 1:39:34.599
What do you mean?

1:39:35.683 --> 1:39:37.977
We used each other and it's okay.

1:39:38.937 --> 1:39:40.480
Do you think I used you?

1:39:40.563 --> 1:39:42.732
Listen, what I'm saying is,

1:39:42.816 --> 1:39:47.570
you were coming out of your
shit with Christos and I...

1:39:47.654 --> 1:39:50.031
- This has nothing to do with-
- And we had a crazy weekend

1:39:50.114 --> 1:39:52.242
and it was fucking amazing and then...

1:39:52.325 --> 1:39:54.452
You know, but like...

1:39:54.536 --> 1:39:56.579
It doesn't matter because
I'm here and I love you

1:39:56.663 --> 1:39:58.039
and I really mean that.

1:39:58.122 --> 1:40:01.084
Have you no fucking
idea what I've been doing

1:40:01.167 --> 1:40:04.963
to try and fucking keep us
together since we got together

1:40:05.046 --> 1:40:05.880
and you're telling me that you think-

1:40:05.964 --> 1:40:07.632
- I know. I know. I
know. Please, be quiet.

1:40:10.218 --> 1:40:11.803
- Shit.
- Let's go.

1:40:12.637 --> 1:40:14.013
Let's go.

1:40:14.097 --> 1:40:16.975
Go, go, just go, let's go.

1:40:17.058 --> 1:40:18.601
Let's go.

1:40:18.685 --> 1:40:19.519
Come on.

1:40:23.565 --> 1:40:24.399
Fuck.

1:40:25.483 --> 1:40:27.068
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:40:28.319 --> 1:40:29.154
- Wait.
- What?

1:40:30.405 --> 1:40:31.573
What happened?

1:40:31.656 --> 1:40:33.408
What happened to us?

1:40:38.246 --> 1:40:40.498
Remember the night we were on the beach?

1:40:40.582 --> 1:40:42.167
I love that fucking night.

1:40:42.250 --> 1:40:46.004
Yeah, and we were naked
and everything was great.

1:40:46.087 --> 1:40:47.922
Yeah, we got arrested.

1:40:48.006 --> 1:40:48.923
I have an idea.

1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:52.135
Let's go to the beach.

1:40:52.218 --> 1:40:53.720
Come on, let's go to the beach.

1:40:54.846 --> 1:40:55.805
Are you fucking...

1:40:57.724 --> 1:40:58.600
- Is that what you want?
- Oh my God.

1:40:58.683 --> 1:40:59.684
You wanna go to the beach?

1:40:59.767 --> 1:41:01.269
Let's go to the beach.

1:41:01.352 --> 1:41:03.688
Fine. Let's go to the fucking beach.

1:41:03.771 --> 1:41:05.523
- Let's go to the beach.
- Let's go to the fucking beach.

1:41:05.607 --> 1:41:06.774
Oh my God.

1:41:06.858 --> 1:41:09.319
You wanna go to the fucking beach?

1:41:09.402 --> 1:41:10.612
Come on, let's go.

1:41:10.695 --> 1:41:12.489
Come on. Come on.

1:41:12.572 --> 1:41:14.073
Let's go to the fucking beach.

1:41:20.872 --> 1:41:22.707
Let's go to the beach.

1:41:33.718 --> 1:41:35.178
Yeah!

1:41:35.261 --> 1:41:37.388
Fuck, I love you so much.

1:41:52.153 --> 1:41:53.321
I love you.

1:41:53.404 --> 1:41:54.280
I love you. I love you.

1:41:54.364 --> 1:41:56.533
I really, really love you.

1:41:56.616 --> 1:41:57.450
Oh fuck!

1:42:04.833 --> 1:42:06.835
This is fucking amazing.

1:42:09.254 --> 1:42:10.296
Hi.

1:42:11.548 --> 1:42:12.382
No, no, no, no.

1:42:12.465 --> 1:42:14.801
You wanna come to the beach?

1:42:19.264 --> 1:42:21.099
- Go, go, go, go.
- Fuck!

1:42:23.893 --> 1:42:24.727
Oh, great!

1:42:29.983 --> 1:42:32.777
- Whoo!
- Oh, we're gonna die.

1:42:32.861 --> 1:42:34.320
We're going to the beach.

1:42:34.404 --> 1:42:38.366
- We're going to the beach!
- We're going to the beach!

1:42:51.421 --> 1:42:52.922
There's two of them, I've got to pull over.

1:42:53.006 --> 1:42:53.882
No, no, no.

1:42:53.965 --> 1:42:55.592
Come on, I've gotta pull over.

1:42:55.675 --> 1:42:56.509
No!

1:42:56.593 --> 1:42:58.094
Okay.

1:42:58.178 --> 1:42:59.387
Stop the bike.

1:42:59.471 --> 1:43:00.930
- Fuck you!
- We're going to the beach.

1:43:01.014 --> 1:43:02.432
- We're going to the beach.
- We're going to the beach.

1:43:02.515 --> 1:43:04.309
Okay, okay, okay.

1:43:04.392 --> 1:43:05.310
Fuck you.

1:43:18.448 --> 1:43:19.282
Okay.

1:43:20.742 --> 1:43:21.993
No, no, no, no.

1:43:23.578 --> 1:43:24.412
Chloe!

1:43:26.998 --> 1:43:27.832
Chloe!

1:43:51.815 --> 1:43:52.649
Ow!

1:44:09.624 --> 1:44:11.209
Actual bodily harm.

1:44:13.169 --> 1:44:14.963
Assault and affray.

1:44:16.548 --> 1:44:19.050
Driving under the influence.

1:44:20.927 --> 1:44:22.637
Reckless endangerment.

1:44:24.722 --> 1:44:26.307
Evading an officer.

1:44:28.184 --> 1:44:30.061
Indecent exposure.

1:44:31.521 --> 1:44:33.148
That's a lot of charges.

1:44:33.231 --> 1:44:34.774
Can you tell us what's gonna happen?

1:44:34.858 --> 1:44:36.317
What happens now?

1:44:36.401 --> 1:44:38.319
Depends on what the judge says on Monday.

1:44:38.403 --> 1:44:39.946
- What?
- Wait, what do you mean?

1:44:40.029 --> 1:44:41.156
We can't do Monday.

1:44:41.239 --> 1:44:42.282
Sir, we can't do Monday.

1:44:42.365 --> 1:44:44.159
We have a legal thing. My son.

1:44:44.242 --> 1:44:46.327
We can't stay here until Monday.

1:44:46.411 --> 1:44:48.329
We can give the bail money or something.

1:44:48.413 --> 1:44:49.664
It doesn't matter but we can't do Monday.

1:44:49.747 --> 1:44:50.790
No.

1:44:50.874 --> 1:44:53.084
- We can come back.
- Fuck!

1:44:58.256 --> 1:45:01.050
- Mickey!
- It's gonna be alright.

1:45:07.683 --> 1:45:09.560
Here, have a cigarette.

1:45:13.354 --> 1:45:14.522
Yes, please.

1:45:20.945 --> 1:45:23.448
It's really kind, I appreciate it.

1:45:23.699 --> 1:45:26.618
I don't understand
English, but please be calm.

1:45:26.702 --> 1:45:30.330
Everything will be over soon.

1:45:31.956 --> 1:45:33.583
I don't understand.

1:45:35.418 --> 1:45:36.252
Thank you.

1:46:17.711 --> 1:46:20.797
Wakey-wakey girls, move it!

1:46:38.398 --> 1:46:39.983
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:46:40.859 --> 1:46:42.318
I brought you some clothes.

1:46:44.571 --> 1:46:45.822
Oh, thank you.

1:46:45.905 --> 1:46:47.448
Put them on.

1:46:47.532 --> 1:46:49.242
Wash your face, you'll feel better.

1:46:50.368 --> 1:46:51.452
Thank you.

1:46:51.536 --> 1:46:52.996
You will be fine.

1:46:54.372 --> 1:46:55.206
Okay.

1:46:57.125 --> 1:46:57.959
Thanks.

1:47:00.795 --> 1:47:01.921
Excuse me.

1:47:20.983 --> 1:47:23.819
The court finds the
defendant guilty as charged

1:47:23.902 --> 1:47:29.199
and passes a six month sentence,
suspended for three years

1:47:29.283 --> 1:47:33.453
as well as a €600 fine.

1:47:33.661 --> 1:47:35.038
It's okay.

1:47:35.121 --> 1:47:38.333
It's six months, suspended
for three years and 600 Euros.

1:47:40.418 --> 1:47:41.252
Thank you.

1:47:51.346 --> 1:47:52.180
Thank you so much.

1:47:52.263 --> 1:47:53.848
No, it's okay.

1:47:53.932 --> 1:47:55.558
Where's Mickey? Where's my boyfriend?

1:47:55.642 --> 1:47:57.018
Do you know what happened with him?

1:47:57.101 --> 1:47:59.229
I think that his case was dismissed.

1:48:00.730 --> 1:48:01.815
Oh.

1:48:01.898 --> 1:48:03.441
Okay.

1:48:03.525 --> 1:48:05.735
Look, how do I get these...

1:48:05.819 --> 1:48:07.153
Don't worry about the clothes.

1:48:07.237 --> 1:48:08.071
It's okay.

1:48:09.113 --> 1:48:10.490
Thank you.

1:48:10.573 --> 1:48:11.866
I really appreciate it.

1:48:11.950 --> 1:48:13.910
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

1:48:13.993 --> 1:48:15.537
Bye.

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:16.454
Bye.

1:48:43.106 --> 1:48:45.400
Oh my God. Come here.

1:48:45.483 --> 1:48:46.568
What are you doing here?

1:48:47.819 --> 1:48:50.113
I thought you were getting out at 12.

1:48:53.116 --> 1:48:55.118
How are you here?

1:48:55.201 --> 1:48:56.244
I got here on Saturday.

1:48:56.327 --> 1:48:57.954
Look at me. Hey.

1:48:58.037 --> 1:48:59.998
What do you mean you got here on Saturday?

1:49:00.081 --> 1:49:01.708
I got out. I got out early.

1:49:01.791 --> 1:49:03.084
Well, obviously you got out early.

1:49:03.168 --> 1:49:05.879
How did you get out
early? Stop touching me.

1:49:05.962 --> 1:49:07.172
How did you get out?

1:49:08.882 --> 1:49:09.716
I got out.

1:49:10.842 --> 1:49:12.302
I made some phone calls.

1:49:12.385 --> 1:49:16.848
I tried to call somebody,
I called Argyris and he...

1:49:17.974 --> 1:49:19.934
Argyris got you out?

1:49:20.018 --> 1:49:22.353
He hooked me up with someone
and I tried to get out

1:49:22.437 --> 1:49:23.771
and I tried to get you out.

1:49:23.855 --> 1:49:25.273
Who? Who did he hook you up with?

1:49:25.356 --> 1:49:26.608
It doesn't matter.

1:49:26.691 --> 1:49:29.861
Who did he hook you up with, Mickey?

1:49:31.613 --> 1:49:33.198
Who did he hook you up with?

1:49:34.491 --> 1:49:35.533
He called Christos.

1:49:39.078 --> 1:49:41.789
- It's fine.
- You called Christos?

1:49:41.873 --> 1:49:46.878
And Christos got you out
and you left me there?

1:49:48.046 --> 1:49:49.339
I didn't leave you there, hold on.

1:49:49.422 --> 1:49:50.298
- You left me there.
- I didn't leave you there.

1:49:50.381 --> 1:49:51.466
I was gonna come back for you-

1:49:51.549 --> 1:49:54.052
- For three fucking
days you left me there.

1:49:54.135 --> 1:49:55.553
Listen to me.

1:49:55.637 --> 1:49:58.097
I talked to him, I asked
him if he can get you out,

1:49:58.181 --> 1:50:00.141
ask the DA or whatever and he said...

1:50:00.225 --> 1:50:02.977
Any fucking idea what
you have fucking done?

1:50:03.061 --> 1:50:03.895
Calm down. Listen to me.

1:50:03.978 --> 1:50:05.647
No, I won't fucking calm down.

1:50:05.730 --> 1:50:07.273
You called fucking Christos...

1:50:07.357 --> 1:50:08.942
- Yes I did.
- And you left me

1:50:09.025 --> 1:50:10.819
- in fucking prison.
- I didn't wanna leave you.

1:50:10.902 --> 1:50:12.320
I didn't wanna leave you, listen to me.

1:50:12.403 --> 1:50:16.866
For the fucking weekend
while you fucking sit here.

1:50:17.408 --> 1:50:18.243
God, fuck you.

1:50:19.577 --> 1:50:22.747
Oh my God, what am I fucking doing?

1:50:22.831 --> 1:50:24.040
Fuck me?

1:50:24.123 --> 1:50:25.333
Fuck me?

1:50:25.416 --> 1:50:26.918
Did I get us in jail?

1:50:28.378 --> 1:50:30.088
Did I fucking hit a cop?

1:50:30.171 --> 1:50:33.424
Did I tell me to take
my fucking clothes off?

1:50:33.508 --> 1:50:34.717
Did I wanna run around fucking naked?

1:50:34.801 --> 1:50:36.511
You dumb fucking thing!

1:50:36.594 --> 1:50:38.847
Is that me? Did I wanna fuck with you?

1:50:38.930 --> 1:50:40.265
Or was that you?

1:50:45.603 --> 1:50:47.480
You hit a fucking cop.

1:50:47.564 --> 1:50:50.358
I tried to get you out, he
couldn't fucking get you out.

1:50:50.441 --> 1:50:52.318
I had to come here for fucking Hector

1:50:52.402 --> 1:50:53.570
'cause I didn't know when the fuck

1:50:53.653 --> 1:50:55.363
we were gonna get out and here we are.
