we're even having

43:24.688 --> 43:26.606
this conversation, Monk.

43:26.606 --> 43:29.109
The man was bungee jumping.

43:29.109 --> 43:31.736
He voluntarily jumped
off of a bridge.

43:31.736 --> 43:33.321
I know.

43:33.321 --> 43:35.448
You just accused Rick Eden
of orchestrating his murder.

43:35.448 --> 43:37.033
Why?

43:37.033 --> 43:38.993
Because he couldn't recognize
one of his delivery drivers?

43:38.993 --> 43:41.162
How did he know Lucas Kubrick
was a delivery driver?

43:41.162 --> 43:43.039
I didn't tell him.
- Well, it's a pretty safe bet.

43:43.039 --> 43:44.582
Most of his employees are.

43:44.582 --> 43:47.460
Actually, it's less than 30%.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.587
OK, well, the man misspoke.

43:49.587 --> 43:50.797
Slip of the tongue.

43:50.797 --> 43:52.424
Plus, there's the motive.

43:52.424 --> 43:56.219
Then, there's his choice
of reading material.

43:56.219 --> 43:57.554
It's Griffin.

43:57.554 --> 43:59.764
All right, well, the guy
was doing some research.

43:59.764 --> 44:02.726
He was curious.
Doesn't mean anything.

44:04.853 --> 44:07.689
"The Death of Socrates."

44:07.689 --> 44:09.607
Is that the original?

44:09.607 --> 44:11.192
I'm sure it is.

44:14.029 --> 44:16.489
OK, Monk, how about this?

44:16.489 --> 44:20.660
We call the new chief
of detectives, Captain Rudner.

44:20.660 --> 44:22.996
She's good--
almost as good as I was.

44:22.996 --> 44:27.208

her and see what she says, OK?

44:40.055 --> 44:42.849
I drop whatever the hell I'm
doing, and I make it happen.

44:42.849 --> 44:44.517

44:44.517 --> 44:46.061
Good, now prove it.

44:46.061 --> 44:47.854

44:47.854 --> 44:49.564

private sector booty.

44:49.564 --> 44:51.024
Will do. Yes, ma'am.

44:51.024 --> 44:52.400
And when Leland
says he's bringing

44:52.400 --> 44:56.780
his friend, Adrian Monk,
we roll out the red carpet.

44:56.780 --> 44:59.199

Oh, visitor.

45:03.036 --> 45:04.746

45:04.746 --> 45:06.206

That's because we

Whenever you're ready.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.953
We've got the Vinton Creek
Bridge the day of.

45:44.953 --> 45:46.621
We tracked down 14 witnesses.

45:46.621 --> 45:48.415
Eight of them were recording,
so we pretty much

45:48.415 --> 45:49.582
have the whole scene.

45:49.582 --> 45:50.917
Oh, there's Molly.

45:50.917 --> 45:53.753
As you can see,
Griffin arrives at 2:12.

45:53.753 --> 45:55.171
He's already
wearing the harness,

45:55.171 --> 45:56.965
and he's got
the bungee cord with him,

45:56.965 --> 45:58.008

the whole time.

45:58.008 --> 45:59.426
No one else touches it.

45:59.426 --> 46:00.760
That's our guy.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.303
That's Kubrick.

46:02.303 --> 46:03.555
I've been watching
this all morning.

46:03.555 --> 46:05.265
Kubrick and Griffin
don't interact at all.

46:05.265 --> 46:06.516
They don't talk.

46:06.516 --> 46:07.934
They're never within
four feet of each other.

I'd still like
to talk to him.

46:09.811 --> 46:11.646
Unfortunately,
that door has been closed.

46:11.646 --> 46:13.023
He lawyered up this morning.

46:13.023 --> 46:14.315
What does that tell you?

46:14.315 --> 46:15.942
Tells me he doesn't
like talking to cops.

considering his pedigree.

46:24.784 --> 46:26.745
and he did a two-year
jolt in Salinas.

46:26.745 --> 46:28.621
Which explains
why Rick Eden hired him.

46:28.621 --> 46:30.790
He was looking for an employee
with a criminal record.

46:30.790 --> 46:32.500
Hired him for what?

46:32.500 --> 46:35.712
You saw the tape.
He didn't do anything.

46:54.606 --> 46:56.900
Until yesterday, it was
four Millennium Falcons.

Now, it is
the Vinton Creek Bridge.

47:00.362 --> 47:01.738
This is Griffin.

47:01.738 --> 47:04.157
Here's the bungee cord.

47:04.157 --> 47:08.286
Now, Griffin is
jumping off the bridge.

47:09.788 --> 47:12.582
He was planning to stop
right there, right?

47:12.582 --> 47:16.086
But we know that Griffin
measured the cord himself,

47:16.086 --> 47:19.172
so it wasn't the cord.

47:19.172 --> 47:23.134
So what's the only other
possible explanation?

47:25.053 --> 47:27.972
Someone lowered the bridge.

47:27.972 --> 47:29.349
Oh, no.

47:29.349 --> 47:31.017
Yeah, all he had to do
was replace these four
