WEBVTT

00:15.098 --> 00:17.225
No... No!

00:17.308 --> 00:19.853
No! Listen, you still have one last chance

00:19.936 --> 00:21.855
before you do something irredeemable.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.481
Like any other akumatized villain,

00:23.565 --> 00:24.899
once you transform back,

00:24.983 --> 00:26.943
you'll forget everything you've seen,

00:27.027 --> 00:29.696
including the things
you wrote in that notebook.

00:29.779 --> 00:33.116
So, don't read it
and everything will be okay.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.163
Huh?

00:40.832 --> 00:43.376
No! No! Don't read it!

00:56.681 --> 00:59.309
This is the end.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.706
Booya! My guard captures your general!

02:05.166 --> 02:06.793
Empress in check.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.087
You're about to lose again, mini me!

02:09.921 --> 02:12.799
Come on! It's like you know my every move

02:12.882 --> 02:14.926
- ahead of time!
- Of course I do.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.928
I'm who you'll be in a few years.

02:17.011 --> 02:20.014
I know what you're about to do
because I've done it before.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.267
And I'm both of you but older.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.978
I've gone through everything
you're going through,

02:25.061 --> 02:27.105
which means I know how angry

02:27.188 --> 02:29.190
this defeat is gonna make you.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.692
Check mate, girls!

02:30.775 --> 02:32.694
Come on!

02:32.777 --> 02:35.864
We're now at Alex age 15: zero wins,

02:35.947 --> 02:38.533
Alex age 25: zero wins,

02:38.616 --> 02:42.787
and Alex age 70: 12,123 wins!

02:42.871 --> 02:45.915
Playing with you is no fun, Granny me!

02:45.999 --> 02:49.252
Really? 'Cause I love playing with you!

02:49.335 --> 02:50.879
One day, I'll look into the future

02:50.962 --> 02:53.214
to watch your moves,
then I'll be the winner.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.549
You'll be cheating!

02:54.632 --> 02:56.009
You don't mess with the timeline

02:56.092 --> 02:57.135
just for fun, mini me.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.803
Interfering with events...

02:58.887 --> 03:01.472
Can have serious consequences.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.641
That's right. When you're trying
to solve a problem,

03:03.725 --> 03:06.311
don't go and cause more problems.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.938
So, who's up for another round?

03:11.107 --> 03:13.693
Huh?
Looks like there won't be time.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.029
Yup, it just started.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.072
What just started? What's happening?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.782
The end, mini me.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.409
The end of time.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.120
What? What in the hop is going on?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.664
Don't worry, if we managed
to get out of this,

03:26.748 --> 03:28.249
you will too.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.376
And what am I supposed to do exactly?

03:30.460 --> 03:33.338
If we told you, we'd be cheating.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.096
A little heads up would have been nice!

03:42.180 --> 03:44.724
Okay, think, Alex. Think.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.310
Okay, they must have disappeared

03:47.393 --> 03:49.062
because something was changed
in the course

03:49.145 --> 03:51.231
of history, something
that makes me not exist

03:51.314 --> 03:52.649
in the near future.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.651
So, the beginning is still the same.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.237
Marinette receives
the Miraculous of the Ladybug,

03:57.320 --> 03:59.697
Adrien gets the Miraculous of the Cat,

04:00.865 --> 04:03.743
and becomes Cat Noir
while she becomes Ladybug.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.247
That same day, they meet,

04:07.330 --> 04:08.665
but Marinette can't bring herself

04:08.748 --> 04:10.208
to tell Adrien she loves him.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.464
And anyway, Adrien
is smitten with Ladybug.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.633
They fight Monarch,

04:19.175 --> 04:21.344
the bearer of
the Miraculous of the Butterfly,

04:22.178 --> 04:23.638
but what they don't know is that...

04:23.721 --> 04:25.223
Dark wings, fall.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.018
Behind the supervillain's mask

04:29.102 --> 04:31.688
is actually Gabriel Agreste,
Adrien's father,

04:31.771 --> 04:34.148
and he wants to get his hands on
the Miraculous to make a wish.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.693
Time passes, a long time.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.153
Ah! Marinette and Adrien kiss!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.114
Finally! Gee!

04:41.197 --> 04:43.866
But they still have no idea that
they're Ladybug and Cat Noir,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.077
and then Gabriel Agreste
is sending his son

04:46.160 --> 04:47.829
to London to protect him

04:47.912 --> 04:50.540
right before he akumatizes
the whole world to defeat

04:50.623 --> 04:52.250
Ladybug and Cat Noir.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.876
Mrs. Tsurugi, his ally,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.753
has done the same
with her daughter, Kagami.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.505
Nothing's changed.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.050
This is when Ladybug gets proof
that Gabriel Agreste

05:01.134 --> 05:03.553
is Monarch, that hasn't changed either.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.805
Next, Bugnoire defeats Monarch

05:05.888 --> 05:07.849
and takes down the Miraculous
of the Butterfly.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.644
Ultimate blunder!

05:12.895 --> 05:14.689
Come on, faster!

05:14.772 --> 05:17.275
Where is it? That's how it happened

05:17.358 --> 05:20.611
and how it's still happening,
so far nothing's wrong.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.906
Gabriel makes his wish,
history's still on course.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.076
What's going on?
Why is there nothing?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.953
There's nothing left! Nothing at all!

05:29.037 --> 05:31.039
Hey! What?

05:31.664 --> 05:34.542
I scrolled too fast.
I must have missed something.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.927
Okay, we have a huge problem.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.781
<i>We have a live report</i>
<i>from Clara Contard</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:07.075
<i>who is flying in our helicopter</i>
<i>above Paris.</i>

06:07.158 --> 06:08.659
<i>Can you confirm everything's over?</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:10.161
<i>Yes, Nadja, we just saw</i>

06:10.244 --> 06:12.288
<i>Ladybug's magic ladybugs fly by.</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:14.040
<i>All the damage has been repaired.</i>

06:14.123 --> 06:16.209
<i>This nightmare is finally over.</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:18.044
<i>That's excellent news,</i>
<i>bound to make</i>

06:18.127 --> 06:19.712
<i>the people of Paris and,</i>
<i>I'm sure, the world</i>

06:19.796 --> 06:20.963
<i>feel better.</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:22.548
<i>Stay with us, we'll be back</i>

06:22.632 --> 06:23.841
<i>after a quick news recap.</i>

06:26.260 --> 06:28.388
<i>Hello and welcome if you're tuning in now.</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:30.306
<i>Today's main event is, of course,</i>

06:30.390 --> 06:31.974
<i>the unprecedented chaos</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:34.394
<i>our entire world was just plunged into.</i>

06:34.477 --> 06:37.021
<i>We still don't know</i>
<i>how any of this was possible,</i>

06:37.105 --> 06:39.065
<i>but it turns out supervillain Monarch</i>

06:39.148 --> 06:40.691
<i>had successfully akumatized</i>

06:40.775 --> 06:42.819
<i>every single Alliance ring owner.</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:44.904
<i>If you meant</i>
<i>what you said earlier,</i>

06:44.987 --> 06:46.739
<i>then we both want the same thing.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:48.658
<i>We want Adrien to be happy.</i>

06:48.741 --> 06:50.701
<i>Billions of people</i>
<i>were Miraculized.</i>

06:50.785 --> 06:53.204
<i>That's nearly the entire world population</i>

06:53.287 --> 06:54.997
<i>appointed evil super powers</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:57.333
<i>in order to capture Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:59.752
<i>Power of any nature</i>
<i>should only be used</i>

06:59.836 --> 07:02.296
<i>for the greater good,</i>
<i>but we can think and work out</i>

07:02.380 --> 07:05.049
<i>a solution on our own human scale,</i>

07:05.133 --> 07:08.094
<i>even though it won't be</i>
<i>as perfect as we want it to be.</i>

07:09.804 --> 07:11.556
<i>Spots and claws, away!</i>

07:12.140 --> 07:14.392
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>Ladybug saved not only Paris</i>

07:14.475 --> 07:16.144
<i>but the whole world too.</i>

07:16.853 --> 07:19.021
Marinette, make sure
that Adrien never knows

07:19.105 --> 07:20.606
about the villain that I was

07:20.690 --> 07:22.442
but instead that he remembers the times

07:22.525 --> 07:23.818
I tried to be a good father.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.987
<i>This time, more than ever, Ladybug,</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:27.071
<i>we thank you.</i>

07:28.364 --> 07:29.991
So, it's over?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.159
Yes.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.119
<i>Over</i> over?

07:33.202 --> 07:34.871
Over over.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.289
But Adrien...

07:36.372 --> 07:38.166
cannot find out.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.503
You're blinded by love, Marinette,

07:42.587 --> 07:44.714
but if this is your wish...

07:44.797 --> 07:46.716
I'll honor it.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.135
There's still one last problem.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.761
Your mother, Kagami.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.180
<i>She was Monarch's accomplice.</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:55.141
She put the world in danger.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.768
Normally, I should bring her to justice,

07:57.852 --> 07:59.896
but I don't want to make you suffer.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.815
If she has nothing else to lose anymore,

08:02.899 --> 08:04.650
she could admit everything

08:04.734 --> 08:07.195
and reveal that Gabriel Agreste
was Monarch.

08:07.278 --> 08:10.156
And Adrien would find out
about his father.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.993
Adrien changed when he tried
to confront his father,

08:14.076 --> 08:16.537
and I've changed since I met you.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.790
Everyone can change. My mother as well.

08:19.874 --> 08:20.917
I'll talk to her.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.919
You sure?

08:23.002 --> 08:24.754
Let me at least try.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.656
Catacl...

09:03.960 --> 09:05.127
Ladybug?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.384
My father's not here?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.430
Why aren't you saying anything?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.349
Your father...

09:21.519 --> 09:23.813
Your father was...

09:25.064 --> 09:26.566
was...

09:28.693 --> 09:29.860
a hero.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.113
Your father was a hero.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.830
The truth is...

09:40.913 --> 09:42.873
Monarch was forcing your father

09:42.957 --> 09:45.710
and Mrs. Tsurugi to work for him.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.878
He forced them to design
the alliance rings

09:47.962 --> 09:49.630
in order to turn the entire world

09:49.714 --> 09:52.216
against me and Cat Noir.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.676
If they said no.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.886
Monarch threatened to go after you

09:55.970 --> 09:57.096
and Kagami.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.015
I saw your ladybugs fly by,

09:59.098 --> 10:00.808
which means you defeated Monarch.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.518
I did face him.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.562
In your home. He...

10:04.645 --> 10:07.440
He had taken Nathalie
and your father hostage,

10:07.523 --> 10:09.900
and I fought as hard as I could,

10:09.984 --> 10:12.236
but... he was too mighty,

10:12.320 --> 10:16.198
and Monarch had too many powers,
too many Miraculous.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.242
He severely injured me.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.828
I couldn't stop him from taking
the Miraculous of the Ladybug

10:20.911 --> 10:22.121
and the Black Cat.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.708
Monarch was about to make a wish
and that's...

10:25.791 --> 10:27.418
when your father...

10:28.628 --> 10:30.713
That's when your father became a hero.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.008
At the last minute,
your father pounced on Monarch,

10:34.091 --> 10:37.678
seized the Miraculous,
and made a wish in his place.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.139
He saved Nathalie's life and mine

10:40.222 --> 10:42.433
in exchange for Monarch's life

10:42.516 --> 10:44.435
and his own.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.526
Why didn't you save him?
Even if something had happened

10:52.610 --> 10:54.236
to him, aren't your magic ladybugs

10:54.320 --> 10:55.863
supposed to repair everything?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.990
This is impossible! You have to be wrong!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.826
I swear I tried everything.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.956
If he hadn't locked me in here,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.417
I could've saved him.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.170
Believe me, there's nothing
you could have done.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.923
Dad...

11:14.507 --> 11:16.175
That's why your father had sent you

11:16.258 --> 11:18.386
and Kagami here to London,

11:18.469 --> 11:19.762
to protect you.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.724
I'm so sorry.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.852
There was no good way
of telling you all of this.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.438
But I wanted to be the one to say it

11:29.522 --> 11:31.899
before you found out some other way.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.317
I'm...

11:33.401 --> 11:34.652
I'm so...

11:34.735 --> 11:36.904
so sorry, Adrien.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.572
- I...
- Thank you, Ladybug.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.908
Surely, you have
many other things to deal with.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.245
Yes.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.975
<i>Ladybug, can you</i>
<i>explain what really happened?</i>

12:06.058 --> 12:08.686
<i>The fight took</i>
<i>place at Gabriel Agreste...</i>

12:08.769 --> 12:10.771
<i>Is there a</i>
<i>connection between Mr. Agreste</i>

12:10.855 --> 12:12.481
<i>- and Monarch?</i>
- <i>The man who went</i>

12:12.565 --> 12:15.651
<i>by Hawk Moth, Shadow Moth,</i>
<i>and lastly Monarch,</i>

12:16.193 --> 12:18.487
<i>had forced Mr. Gabriel Agreste</i>
<i>and Mrs. Tsurugi</i>

12:19.029 --> 12:21.365
<i>to design the Alliance rings.</i>

12:21.449 --> 12:23.826
<i>He planned to Miraculize the entire world</i>

12:23.909 --> 12:25.411
<i>in order to seize the Miraculous</i>

12:25.494 --> 12:27.788
<i>of the Ladybug and the Black Cat.</i>

12:27.872 --> 12:30.207
But why was he after
your Miraculous?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.084
- Haven't got a clue.
- Ladybug,

12:32.168 --> 12:34.587
you defeated Monarch,
which means you uncovered

12:34.670 --> 12:36.839
who he was beneath the mask, right?

12:36.922 --> 12:40.801
No. We'll never know
about his secret identity,

12:40.885 --> 12:44.346
but thanks to Gabriel Agreste's
heroic sacrifice,

12:44.430 --> 12:46.390
<i>we're finally free from Monarch.</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:48.768
<i>Is it true you</i>
<i>couldn't reclaim the Miraculous</i>

12:48.851 --> 12:50.144
<i>of the Butterfly?</i>

12:50.227 --> 12:51.771
Yes, but...

12:51.854 --> 12:53.397
<i>Did you lose because you had</i>

12:53.481 --> 12:54.523
<i>to face Monarch alone?</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:55.816
I'm sorry, there's nothing more

12:55.900 --> 12:57.735
I can say. Bug out.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.820
Ladybug!

14:45.217 --> 14:46.218
Bug out.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.900
I did the right thing, didn't I?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.568
About what?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.403
Lying to Adrien.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.656
I couldn't tell him
that his father was Monarch.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.325
I had no choice.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.701
You understand, right?

15:10.784 --> 15:12.244
Well...

15:12.912 --> 15:15.748
None of us is
the Kwami of Truth, Marinette.

15:15.831 --> 15:19.460
So, I'm not sure we can answer
your question truthfully.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.712
I lied to Adrien,

15:21.795 --> 15:24.173
and Alya, and the whole world.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.758
I know it was for a good cause,

15:25.841 --> 15:28.677
but I can't help
but feel terrible about it.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.430
Stop thinking and get some rest.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.390
You probably need it.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.687
And you will need it.

15:52.868 --> 15:53.953
What's happening?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.624
Tikki! Plagg!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.584
Someone's making a wish,
but how can anyone

16:00.668 --> 16:02.586
do that without the Miracu...

16:02.670 --> 16:04.296
Cat Noir's ring?

16:04.380 --> 16:05.589
My earrings!

16:08.717 --> 16:09.718
Over here!

16:12.930 --> 16:14.223
Someone's made a wish!

16:14.306 --> 16:15.307
And not just any wish.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.892
This one will reshape the universe

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
in a way no one's ever seen before.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.688
Uh, why are they all black?

16:20.771 --> 16:23.399
It's like we're at the movies
and the film has ended.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.775
There's nothing more to see.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.485
The end of our universe?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.821
That's a bit dramatic, but yeah.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.240
We'll figure something out
to fix this, don't worry.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.783
But first...

16:32.866 --> 16:34.493
What am I supposed to do with this?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.537
Time travel is always a complex matter.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.330
With this, we'll always know it's you,

16:38.414 --> 16:40.040
present-time Marinette.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.875
I came and grabbed you
at the very last second

16:41.959 --> 16:43.168
of the timeline I had access to.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.462
Good thing a second here in the Burrow

16:45.546 --> 16:47.506
- lasts for a while.
- Which gives us time

16:47.589 --> 16:49.925
to figure out what went wrong earlier.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.552
Yeah, well,

16:51.635 --> 16:53.387
as long as there's a portal left.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.264
But I don't have my earrings,
I won't be any help

16:55.347 --> 16:56.682
without my Miraculous.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.726
You don't have your earrings now,

16:58.809 --> 17:00.352
but you did once.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.895
Of course!

17:01.979 --> 17:03.647
You can't access the future anymore,

17:03.731 --> 17:05.691
but you can still go back in time.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.609
Nailed it! Except...

17:07.693 --> 17:09.987
Don't mess with the timeline
just for fun, mini me.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.363
Interfering with events...

17:11.447 --> 17:13.949
Can have serious consequences.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.909
We've got to be very careful not to mess

17:15.993 --> 17:17.411
with the course of history.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.830
You sound just like adult you.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.457
Ha! No kidding.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.210
I know! There was this one single time

17:25.294 --> 17:27.254
when I renounced my Miraculous.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.382
Nothing will change if I take it
from that specific moment.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.092
I'm listening. Tell me where

17:32.176 --> 17:33.177
and when.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.807
If Cat Noir can't capture the Akumas,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.642
then just find another Ladybug,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.145
I told you I'm not cut out to be Ladybug.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.773
I'm sorry, Tikki.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.525
No, don't do that!

17:48.609 --> 17:49.610
Tikki?

17:58.577 --> 18:00.746
I'm really sorry, Tikki.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.832
Marinette!

18:03.916 --> 18:06.335
- Breakfast is ready!
- Coming.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.046
Did you see how that new superhero

18:09.129 --> 18:10.881
fought against the stone monster?

18:10.964 --> 18:12.216
Oh, that was something!

18:12.299 --> 18:13.509
What's her name again?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.177
Ladybug.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.304
You look so gloomy, Marinette.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.931
Did supervillain Hawk Moth

18:19.014 --> 18:21.558
- scare you?
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.978
I'm sure that young Ladybug
will fix everything.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.688
Yeah, sure, Dad.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.528
Whoa, I feel like that was,
like, ten years ago.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.535
Marinette? But... When are we?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.328
We're at a point in time where someone

18:41.411 --> 18:42.913
stole my Miraculous.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.666
We need to figure out who, when, and how.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.292
Then I'll bring you back to the Marinette

18:47.376 --> 18:50.170
that you just met. That is, if I succeed.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.548
I'm sure you will succeed.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.968
I hope you're right. Tikki...

18:57.386 --> 18:59.346
Spots on!

18:59.429 --> 19:00.430
Yeah!

19:15.237 --> 19:18.073
Ah! Isn't this a bit... flashy?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.950
Not at all, I love it!

19:20.033 --> 19:22.411
Let's check the timeline
once again, Chronobug.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.545
- There!
- Where? I didn't see anything.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.380
Go back a bit! Slowly...

19:33.463 --> 19:34.715
Stop!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.635
There!

19:38.719 --> 19:39.720
Look!

19:42.973 --> 19:44.933
Is that a ghost?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.477
There's no such thing as ghosts.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.287
Okay, stop. We've seen enough.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.414
Go back some more,
right before the ghost shows up.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.878
Shall we?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.546
No, you stay here.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.757
What if the ghost
managed to seize my Miraculous

20:58.840 --> 21:01.927
and yours? Then things
would really be over.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.679
We can stay in contact.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.764
All right, good luck, Chronobug.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.982
<i>Watch out! Here they come!</i>

21:30.247 --> 21:31.248
Ah!

21:36.795 --> 21:37.796
Hm?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.677
Ugh! There's nothing I can do

21:43.760 --> 21:45.345
against a ghost!

21:45.429 --> 21:47.347
<i>- You faced</i>

21:47.431 --> 21:48.724
<i>a similar villain before.</i>

21:48.807 --> 21:49.808
Troublemaker!

21:51.601 --> 21:53.020
Lucky charm!

21:55.605 --> 21:57.941
How am I supposed to catch a ghost

21:58.025 --> 21:59.192
with a calendar?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.319
<i>Maybe the villain's allergic</i>

22:00.402 --> 22:01.570
<i>to dates?</i>

22:01.653 --> 22:03.113
No! No! No!

22:03.739 --> 22:04.740
Ah!

22:20.422 --> 22:21.757
A butterfly?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.258
Bunnyx!

22:23.342 --> 22:25.719
The ghost must be an akumatized villain!

22:25.802 --> 22:27.596
<i>Created by someone who got their hands</i>

22:27.679 --> 22:29.389
<i>on the Butterfly Miraculous.</i>

22:30.098 --> 22:32.893
And someone who knows who I really am!

22:34.770 --> 22:35.771
The wish!

22:39.566 --> 22:41.985
- Let's go back.
- It's pointless.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.528
We can chase that villain all we want,

22:43.612 --> 22:44.863
but we'll never catch up to them.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.990
We can't even touch them!

22:47.074 --> 22:48.784
So... what?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.202
Is this the end?

22:52.245 --> 22:54.373
No. Nothing's over

22:54.456 --> 22:57.459
till we've tried everything.
We may not be able to find them,

22:57.542 --> 22:59.544
but there must be a way to stop them

22:59.628 --> 23:01.421
from finding me.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.507
- What do you mean?
- The reason why

23:03.590 --> 23:05.133
this akumatized villain was able

23:05.217 --> 23:07.052
to steal the Miraculous from me

23:07.135 --> 23:09.846
was because they knew my secret identity,

23:09.930 --> 23:13.392
but if we can stop them
from finding out who I am...

23:13.475 --> 23:16.144
Then they'll have no way of attacking you!

23:16.228 --> 23:18.230
- Precisely.
- Now we just have to figure out

23:18.313 --> 23:20.065
how your secret was uncovered.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.818
I can only think
of one possible moment.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.362
During my final battle against Monarch.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.782
You mean when
Gabriel Agreste became a hero?

23:30.158 --> 23:31.868
Sorry, that wasn't funny.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.498
Wait! Hold on!

23:37.958 --> 23:39.709
I could retrieve the Miraculous
of the Butterfly

23:39.793 --> 23:41.586
and everything would be back to normal.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.214
I'm not gonna lie.
It was an ultimate blunder

23:44.297 --> 23:47.008
and it's gonna haunt you for
a long time, but it's too late.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.636
If you did that now, you'd
change the course of history,

23:49.719 --> 23:51.555
- and like adult me would say
- When you're trying

23:51.638 --> 23:54.599
to solve a problem, don't go
and cause more problems.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.978
You're right, you and other you.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.813
Let's stick to figuring out who discovered

23:59.896 --> 24:01.064
Marinette is Ladybug.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.488
- Nooroo, bring me...
- Stop!

24:08.572 --> 24:09.906
Go back just a little.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.366
Careful.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.451
There!

24:22.169 --> 24:24.129
Maybe they're the one
who took the Miraculous

24:24.212 --> 24:26.506
of the Butterfly. Go back some more.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.060
That's how they found out who I am.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.145
Veno...

24:41.813 --> 24:43.607
If you meant what you said earlier,

24:43.690 --> 24:45.567
then we both want the same thing.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.986
We want Adrien to be happy.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.197
There's no such thing as a perfect wish.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.282
Every time the power is used
for personal gain,

24:52.365 --> 24:54.326
it causes disasters.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.911
Power of any nature should only

24:55.994 --> 24:57.913
be used for the greater good,

24:57.996 --> 25:00.248
but we can think and work
out a solution on our own

25:00.332 --> 25:01.958
human scale,

25:02.042 --> 25:04.336
even though it won't be as perfect

25:04.419 --> 25:05.587
as we want it to be.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.757
Spots and claws away.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.430
Let it roll. I need to figure out

25:15.514 --> 25:16.848
what they want.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.060
- This is impossible!
- Marinette, don't trust him.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.353
Venom!

25:27.108 --> 25:29.861
I already have my solution, Marinette.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.071
Gimmi,

25:31.154 --> 25:33.406
reveal yourself!

25:35.492 --> 25:38.995
I am Gimmi, the Kwami of Reality.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.168
Gabriel, no! Don't do this!

25:45.252 --> 25:48.463
Marinette, make sure
that Adrien never knows

25:48.547 --> 25:50.507
about the villain that I was, but instead

25:51.258 --> 25:53.927
that he remembers the times
I tried to be a good father.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.890
What do you wish for?

25:58.974 --> 26:00.016
Read my heart.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.310
What do you sacrifice?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.895
Read my soul.

26:04.437 --> 26:06.773
So be I.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.502
What did Gabriele Agreste wish for?

27:10.253 --> 27:13.048
He gave up his life.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.341
In return for Nathalie's,

27:14.424 --> 27:16.551
knowing she was gravely ill.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.553
He did that?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.347
Tikki, Plagg, unify!

27:22.265 --> 27:23.767
I'm not here to fight.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.227
I was expecting to find Gabriel here.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.771
Not you.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.814
I should have stopped him.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.232
Years ago.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.070
I'm not like him, Marinette.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.533
I tried to save him.

27:40.617 --> 27:44.037
I tried to reason with him
for Adrien's sake.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.456
Surely, we could have worked out
a solution together,

27:46.539 --> 27:49.459
and now Adrien no longer has a father,

27:49.542 --> 27:51.461
all because of me.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.047
Adrien is all alone, all because of me!

27:54.130 --> 27:56.007
What did you want to do?

27:57.842 --> 28:01.346
The wish, I should have made
the wish for Adrien.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.848
And what would you have sacrificed?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.267
Myself.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.981
By rekindling what was
still good in Gabriel Agreste,

28:12.065 --> 28:13.775
you saved us all.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.986
Besides, Adrien isn't all alone.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.154
He has you.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.701
And you too.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.550
The Kwamis, where are the Kwamis?

28:38.633 --> 28:39.634
Follow me.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.395
Wow, like we need another supervillain.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.897
They're not another supervillain.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.733
Huh? How do you know?

28:54.816 --> 28:57.360
Because they wrote everything
down in a notebook.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.404
- And?
- If they were just

28:59.487 --> 29:01.114
any akumatized villain,

29:01.197 --> 29:03.116
they'd only need to tell what they saw

29:03.199 --> 29:04.826
to the new Hawk Moth,

29:04.909 --> 29:06.703
who would then send
a new akumatized villain

29:06.786 --> 29:08.455
after me to steal the Miraculous.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.914
- Makes sense.
- But they had

29:09.998 --> 29:12.000
to write everything down

29:12.083 --> 29:13.877
because they knew
that they wouldn't remember

29:13.960 --> 29:15.879
once they transformed back,

29:15.962 --> 29:19.048
so they needed to keep a record
of what they saw

29:19.132 --> 29:21.426
because they're operating all alone

29:21.509 --> 29:24.304
without having anyone
to share information with.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.681
Are you saying that...

29:26.765 --> 29:29.142
The superspy and the superghost

29:29.225 --> 29:30.477
are the same person,

29:30.560 --> 29:31.686
the person who retrieved

29:31.770 --> 29:33.605
the Miraculous of the Butterfly.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.273
They gave themselves the power

29:35.356 --> 29:36.858
to uncover your secret,

29:36.941 --> 29:38.568
and then another power

29:38.651 --> 29:40.445
that allowed them to steal
the Miraculous from you.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.530
- Exactly!
- Wow.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.491
And you figured this out just by seeing

29:44.574 --> 29:46.451
the notebook, Detective Bug?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.369
Elementary, my dear Bunnyx.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.330
Now, go back in time to right before

29:50.413 --> 29:53.041
I detransform in front of Gabriel Agreste.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.084
We are gonna stop them from finding out

29:55.168 --> 29:57.086
I'm Ladybug.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.171
Veno...

30:00.340 --> 30:02.467
If you meant what you said earlier,

30:02.550 --> 30:04.093
then we both want the same thing.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.762
We want Adrien to be happy.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.973
There's no such thing as a perfect wish.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.975
Every time the power is used
for personal gain,

30:11.059 --> 30:13.144
it causes disasters.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.648
Power of any nature should only
be used for the greater good,

30:16.731 --> 30:18.525
but we can think and work out
a solution on our own

30:19.192 --> 30:20.735
human scale,

30:20.819 --> 30:23.446
even though it won't be as perfect

30:23.530 --> 30:24.906
as we want it to be.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.954
- They got away.
- Maybe, but this time

30:31.037 --> 30:33.039
they did not find out that you're Ladybug.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.458
Except the future isn't back,

30:35.542 --> 30:38.753
which means they'll somehow
figure it out another time.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.588
Let's check where you went next.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.097
The Kwamis, where are the Kwamis?

30:49.180 --> 30:50.390
Follow me.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.401
Ladybug! Ladybug!

31:01.484 --> 31:03.069
She's come to save us all!

31:03.152 --> 31:04.279
Or not.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.530
She's not alone.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.906
It's all over, friends.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.324
You can stop being afraid.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.493
Nathalie is on our side.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.497
What is this?

31:14.581 --> 31:15.790
Mrs. Tsurugi wanted Adrien

31:15.874 --> 31:17.375
and her daughter to be spared

31:17.458 --> 31:19.127
from Monarch's final plan.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.629
That's why they were sent to London.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.008
Mrs. Tsurugi was
Gabriel Agreste's accomplice?

31:25.091 --> 31:26.551
Yes, all along.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.015
Do you know how to set them free?

31:38.229 --> 31:40.523
Ladybug, I'm so happy...

31:41.190 --> 31:42.942
Stop! Turn around.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.946
- There they are!
- They're expecting me

31:47.030 --> 31:48.990
to show up again like I did in the crypt.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.742
We've gotta find the right moment.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.001
Miraculous Bugnoire!

32:10.553 --> 32:12.430
Dad! Dad, do you hear me?

32:12.972 --> 32:15.016
Dad! Dad!

32:15.099 --> 32:16.184
Get me out of here!

32:19.354 --> 32:21.648
We need to figure out
what we're gonna tell Adrien.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.650
Bunnyx, this is the moment.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.027
Are you sure it's the right moment?

32:26.110 --> 32:28.947
It is if we don't want them
to find out I'm Marinette.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.741
Believe me, I remember
what I'm gonna say next,

32:31.824 --> 32:34.494
and it'll be too late after that.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.372
Did Adrien know that you were...
supervillains?

32:38.414 --> 32:39.999
And that his mother was still...

32:40.083 --> 32:42.752
No, of course not. And you?

32:42.835 --> 32:44.379
Did you tell him you're Ladybug?

32:44.462 --> 32:46.422
No! Of course not! Never!

32:46.506 --> 32:48.716
I did hope I'd be able to tell him

32:48.800 --> 32:50.843
once Monarch had been defeated, but...

32:50.927 --> 32:52.804
the way things have turned out.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.808
Until I've gotten the Miraculous
of the Butterfly back,

32:56.891 --> 32:59.143
I can't tell him the truth
about his father.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.396
Marinette can't tell him something

33:01.479 --> 33:04.107
only Ladybug is supposed to know.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.901
Stop! Let's go back in time

33:06.985 --> 33:08.736
and catch them before they know that.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.531
Did Adrien know that you were...
supervillains?

33:12.448 --> 33:13.950
And that his mother was still...

33:14.033 --> 33:16.577
No, of course not. And you?

33:16.661 --> 33:18.413
Did you tell him you're Ladybug?

33:18.496 --> 33:20.748
No! Of course not! Never!

33:20.832 --> 33:22.542
I did hope I'd be able to tell him

33:22.625 --> 33:24.210
once Monarch had been defeated,

33:24.293 --> 33:26.963
but the way things have turned out...

33:28.006 --> 33:31.009
Until I've gotten the Miraculous
of the Butterfly back,

33:31.092 --> 33:33.636
I can't tell him the truth
about his father.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.472
Marinette can't tell him
something only Ladybug

33:36.556 --> 33:37.557
is supposed to know.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.149
It's too late!
They figured out that Marinette

33:46.232 --> 33:48.359
- is Ladybug.
- Let's try once again.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.905
Mrs. Tsurugi was
Gabriel Agreste's accomplice?

33:52.989 --> 33:54.365
Yes, all along.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.621
We got 'em!

34:00.705 --> 34:03.082
Nice little time-traveling
gadget you've got.

34:03.166 --> 34:06.586
Too bad it'll stop working soon
and you'll have to hang with us.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.300
No!

34:19.182 --> 34:21.225
Mrs. Tsurugi wanted Adrien
and her daughter

34:21.309 --> 34:23.895
to be spared from Monarch's final plan.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.147
That's why they were sent to London.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.443


34:38.242 --> 34:40.411
So, they weren't an akumatized villain?

34:40.495 --> 34:43.539
They were, it's just that
the Akuma must be somewhere else.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.291
How about in their notebook?

34:47.335 --> 34:49.212
We've gotta give it another try

34:49.295 --> 34:52.173
and hope that he carried
the akumatized object around.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.257
He or she.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.595
We can do this,
we just need to figure out when

34:57.678 --> 34:59.764
and where they'll reappear next.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.100
It'd make sense for them to
be heading to London after this.

35:02.683 --> 35:03.893
Should we follow them?

35:03.976 --> 35:05.353
Huh?

35:05.978 --> 35:07.897
It's time to tell the truth.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.899
If you do that,
you'll go to jail.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.734
Isn't the truth worth it?

35:11.818 --> 35:15.113
If you tell the truth,
Adrien will have no one left.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.781
He'll have lost his mom,

35:16.864 --> 35:18.825
his dad, you...

35:18.908 --> 35:20.827
He will have you.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.286
It's not the same.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.871
He needs a mother.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.915
I'm not his mother.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.292
You're the closest thing
to a mother he's got.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.628
That's why Gabriel Agreste
sacrificed himself.

35:30.711 --> 35:33.214
It's what finally made him a good father

35:33.297 --> 35:36.884
to Adrien, and that's
what Adrien should remember.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.429
Don't you want to tell Adrien
that his father was Monarch?

35:40.513 --> 35:42.807
The only thing I can fix

35:42.890 --> 35:45.560
is the way Adrien
will remember his father.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.020
But that would be lying to him.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.231
The truth would hurt him so much more,

35:50.314 --> 35:51.357
and for what?

35:51.941 --> 35:53.442
Nothing will repair what happened.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.363
I won't be lying to Adrien.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.158
I'll just tell him half of the truth,

36:00.241 --> 36:01.868
that his father sacrificed himself

36:01.951 --> 36:03.786
so you'd be cured

36:03.870 --> 36:06.956
and there'd be someone left
to take care of him.

36:07.039 --> 36:10.168
This is the truth Adrien needs to know.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.420
We're not supposed to know this.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.005
Ladybug knows.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.465
Ladybug holds the truth.

36:16.549 --> 36:20.344
The whole will know
only what Ladybug will tell it.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.930
Her words will be the truth.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.017
We've got to save the future, Chronobug,

36:26.100 --> 36:27.727
and that's why we need to track down

36:27.810 --> 36:29.812
that mysterious supervillain again.

36:29.896 --> 36:32.064
Right.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.900
Sorry, Bunnyx. You're right.

36:33.983 --> 36:34.984
Where to?

36:35.067 --> 36:36.277
We're going to London

36:36.360 --> 36:38.070
an hour after what we just saw.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.674
Where are they hiding now?

37:09.435 --> 37:10.811
They're here.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.480
Huh? I don't see anything?

37:12.563 --> 37:14.649
The light! When I enter the building,

37:14.732 --> 37:16.234
the light is already on,

37:16.859 --> 37:18.778
which means someone's been here already

37:18.861 --> 37:20.738
a few seconds before me.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.157
They're here, Bunnyx.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.326
They were always here.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.686
<i>All the damage</i>
<i>has been repaired.</i>

37:51.769 --> 37:53.896
<i>This nightmare is finally over.</i>

37:53.980 --> 37:55.314
<i>That's excellent news,</i>

37:55.398 --> 37:56.774
<i>bound to make the people of Paris</i>

37:56.857 --> 37:58.401
<i>and I'm sure the world feel better.</i>

37:58.484 --> 38:00.653
<i>- Stay with us, we'll be back</i>

38:00.736 --> 38:02.196
<i>after a quick news recap.</i>

38:03.155 --> 38:04.156
Cataclysm.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.123
Hm...

38:12.206 --> 38:14.417
<i>We still don't know</i>
<i>how any of this was possible,</i>

38:14.500 --> 38:16.085
<i>but it turns out supervillain Monarch</i>

38:16.168 --> 38:18.337
<i>had successfully akumatized</i>
<i>every single...</i>

38:18.421 --> 38:20.131
How could I have missed this?

38:20.214 --> 38:22.008
You had other things to think about.

38:22.591 --> 38:25.052
<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>Ladybug saved not only Paris</i>

38:25.136 --> 38:27.054
<i>but the whole world too.</i>

38:27.138 --> 38:28.723
<i>This time, more than ever, Ladybug,</i>

38:28.806 --> 38:29.807
<i>we thank you.</i>

38:30.558 --> 38:31.851
So, it's over?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.020
Yes.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.187
Over over?

38:35.771 --> 38:37.898
This time it's over, superspy,

38:37.982 --> 38:39.942
superghost, or should I say

38:40.026 --> 38:41.277
new Hawk Moth?

38:44.947 --> 38:46.198
Ah!

38:51.787 --> 38:52.955
Ah!

38:59.837 --> 39:00.838
Ya!

39:14.018 --> 39:16.103
You're blinded by love, Marinette,

39:16.187 --> 39:19.273
but if this is your wish, I'll honor it.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.359
Lucky charm!

39:25.488 --> 39:26.739
You're not leaving just yet!

39:34.663 --> 39:36.374
I don't believe this.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.793
They can't just escape again!

39:38.876 --> 39:42.338
Technically speaking,
we could go on like this forever,

39:42.421 --> 39:44.090
but you gotta know
when to stop before it gets

39:44.173 --> 39:45.508
too repetitive, don't you think?

39:48.386 --> 39:49.512
Hand sanitizer?

39:49.595 --> 39:51.305
Oh, yeah, I'm all for hygiene.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.557
"Always wash your hands
before the world ends."

39:56.644 --> 39:59.814
Seriously though, we're toast, right?

39:59.897 --> 40:02.775
Oh, no, not if I find the tools we need.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.407
Hm...

40:11.158 --> 40:15.079
So, this is the ultimate weapon
that's gonna save the universe?

40:16.288 --> 40:18.332
I sure hope so.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.252
Hm!

40:35.474 --> 40:36.475
Agh!

40:36.851 --> 40:38.686
"Mrs. Tsurugi wanted Adrien

40:38.769 --> 40:41.689
"and her daughter to be spared
from Monarch's final plan.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.774
"That's why they were sent to London."

40:46.110 --> 40:48.112
"Marinette Dupain-Cheng

40:48.195 --> 40:49.488
"is Ladybug."

40:52.199 --> 40:53.534
The alcohol in the gel

40:53.617 --> 40:55.202
is dissolving the ink's pigment.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.788
Your forgery is top notch. Good job!

40:57.872 --> 40:59.415
And now, open a portal for me

40:59.498 --> 41:01.208
just before they realize
I took the notebook.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.127
They can never know what happened.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.553
Looking for this?

41:15.556 --> 41:17.391
Missed me! Missed me!

41:17.475 --> 41:18.767
Missed me again.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.687
You're nothing like the former Hawk Moth,

41:22.354 --> 41:24.648
much more clever, clever enough

41:24.732 --> 41:26.692
to not be wearing the Butterfly
Miraculous like that.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.028
But not clever enough.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.406
Wherever or whenever you go,
I'll be there,

41:32.490 --> 41:33.741
standing in your way,

41:33.824 --> 41:35.493
and I can promise you this,

41:35.576 --> 41:37.620
I will figure out who you are,

41:37.703 --> 41:39.830
and I'll take
the Butterfly Miraculous back.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.168
Ah!

41:50.633 --> 41:53.385
Now it's the end for real.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.685
No! No! No!

42:01.769 --> 42:03.437
Listen, you still have one last chance

42:03.521 --> 42:05.105
before you do something irredeemable,

42:05.189 --> 42:08.234
so don't read it
and everything will be okay.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.826
No! No! No!

42:17.910 --> 42:19.411
Don't read it!

42:20.454 --> 42:22.206
Hm... Huh?

42:22.289 --> 42:24.959
Gabriel Agreste is Ladybug?

42:25.042 --> 42:26.293
That's not possible.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.878
Gabriel Agreste is dead.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.547
Gabriel Agreste cannot be Ladybug.

42:30.172 --> 42:32.841
Why did I write that?
Did something go wrong

42:32.925 --> 42:34.218
with my plan?

42:34.760 --> 42:36.220
No! No!

42:36.303 --> 42:37.304
No!

42:42.601 --> 42:44.603
It didn't work! It didn't work!

42:55.197 --> 42:56.323
Huh?

43:01.954 --> 43:03.664
They gave up.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.750
They finally realized
there's no beating you!

43:09.461 --> 43:10.838
Not bad, mini me.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.881
And well done, mini bug.

43:12.965 --> 43:16.427
Come on, you know that's not
what we say at the end.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.554
Pound it!

43:18.637 --> 43:19.638
Good.

43:21.390 --> 43:24.268
- Bunnyx, what are we gonna do?
- About what?

43:24.351 --> 43:26.645
With this new Hawk Moth,
it might be too risky

43:26.729 --> 43:28.355
if you come back to the present.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.107
Oh, no, does this mean

43:30.190 --> 43:32.067
that I have to keep exploring time?

43:32.151 --> 43:33.360
Riding dinosaurs?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.779
Witnessing humans walking on Mars.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.032
What a shame!

43:38.115 --> 43:39.283
Now go!

43:50.628 --> 43:52.630
Say, Bunnyxs,

43:53.213 --> 43:54.923
I know you can't tell me about the future

43:55.007 --> 43:57.134
so we don't mess up the course
of history and all,

43:57.217 --> 43:59.345
but can you at least tell me

43:59.428 --> 44:01.472
if I was right to hide the truth
from Adrien

44:01.555 --> 44:04.391
about his father in order to protect him?

44:04.475 --> 44:07.102
Lying to him or telling him the truth

44:07.186 --> 44:09.855
will lead to very different consequences

44:09.938 --> 44:12.775
with their share of happy and sad moments.

44:12.858 --> 44:15.361
The important thing about
the choices you make in life

44:15.444 --> 44:17.112
is how you own up to them.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.822
I'm sure you'll rock.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.577
Are you saying that

44:23.661 --> 44:26.080
'cause you saw it in the future?

44:26.163 --> 44:28.248
No, because the ultimate weapon

44:28.332 --> 44:30.876
that saved the universe wasn't this thing.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.753
It was what's in there.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.096
Miraculous Chronobug!

45:06.870 --> 45:09.081
Alya... yes.

45:09.623 --> 45:11.792
Alya would be a great superhero.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.343
Ah! Did it work?

45:21.427 --> 45:23.137
Yes! It worked!

45:25.764 --> 45:26.765
It worked!

45:26.849 --> 45:28.684
Obviously something major

45:28.767 --> 45:31.061
but I feel like
we're missing some information

45:31.145 --> 45:33.689
and I can't make sense of it all.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.691
I know.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.080
What are you doing, Marinette?

45:50.164 --> 45:51.874
I'm transforming the Miraculous.

45:51.957 --> 45:53.375
First to make them prettier,

45:53.459 --> 45:56.044
but mostly to add a few new features.

45:56.128 --> 45:58.297
- We've got to be ready?
- We?

45:58.380 --> 46:00.424
The new Hawk Moth is even more fearsome

46:00.507 --> 46:02.384
than the former one, but this time

46:02.468 --> 46:04.511
they'll have to face an entire team.

46:04.595 --> 46:06.221
Does this mean...

46:06.305 --> 46:08.515
I'm gonna return you all to your holders

46:08.599 --> 46:10.934
and this time you'll stay with them.

46:13.312 --> 46:16.565
But I thought it was dangerous
to leave us with our holders.

46:16.648 --> 46:20.402
I was wrong, the real danger is
having you all here together.

46:20.486 --> 46:24.156
Spreading the power
will make us stronger together.

46:24.239 --> 46:27.159
But I'm gonna miss you,
I love you all so much.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.245
We love you too, Guardian!

46:30.329 --> 46:33.165
So many feelings and emotions.

46:33.248 --> 46:34.750
It's nauseating.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.168
- Here Plagg.
- Hm?

46:36.251 --> 46:37.920
I'm done with this one.

46:38.003 --> 46:40.172
You can go see your Cat Noir.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.882
Gladly, Ladybug.

46:41.965 --> 46:43.801
Things are way too sappy in here

46:43.884 --> 46:45.344
for my taste.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.180
Hm?

47:06.740 --> 47:08.283
Well done, M'Lady.

47:09.243 --> 47:12.371
We've... I mean you have...

47:12.913 --> 47:15.332
I mean Gabriel Agreste has...

47:25.133 --> 47:26.677
How did it go?

47:27.344 --> 47:29.221
It's...

47:29.304 --> 47:30.514
complicated.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.060
Cat Noir...

47:37.187 --> 47:39.606
do you know what it's like to go so far,

47:39.690 --> 47:41.275
almost too far,

47:41.358 --> 47:43.986
in order to protect someone you love?

47:44.069 --> 47:47.781
You mean like sacrificing oneself?

47:47.865 --> 47:50.117
More like, say,

47:50.951 --> 47:54.162
keeping a huge secret,

47:54.246 --> 47:57.499
a secret so heavy

47:57.583 --> 47:59.626
that you really wanna share it
right this minute

47:59.710 --> 48:01.461
because it's too much
and you feel like crying

48:01.545 --> 48:04.006
and you just need someone to comfort you?

48:04.590 --> 48:07.551
Yes, I'm familiar.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.056
I should have been there!

48:13.140 --> 48:14.725
I'm so sorry!

48:14.808 --> 48:16.768
No, I'm the one who's sorry,

48:16.852 --> 48:18.687
and I can't even tell you about it.

48:18.770 --> 48:20.397
It doesn't matter,
all that matters

48:20.480 --> 48:22.190
is that Monarch was defeated.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.860
But I let go of the Butterfly Miraculous.

48:24.943 --> 48:26.570
We'll get it back again,

48:26.653 --> 48:28.196
you and me,

48:28.280 --> 48:29.531
like old times.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.496
Like old times.

49:02.314 --> 49:03.565
Nooroo,

49:03.649 --> 49:05.317
dark wings rise.

49:10.113 --> 49:14.159
<i>So, you really think</i>
<i>you can outsmart me?</i>

49:14.242 --> 49:15.827
<i>Huh, Ladybug?</i>

49:15.911 --> 49:19.331
<i>We'll see who finds who first.</i>
