00:47.791 --> 00:49.791

00:49.958 --> 00:52.083

to guide you.</i>

00:55.791 --> 00:57.125
<i>And so will I.</i>

02:15.416 --> 02:19.541
My friends, the time of
my family's growth is upon us.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.999
This home we share
is the fulfillment

02:23.000 --> 02:24.500
of my father's vision.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.749
How wonderful is it
that Nala and I

02:26.750 --> 02:28.666
get to continue his dream

02:28.833 --> 02:31.415
and make even greater
the Circle of Life?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.875
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

03:18.791 --> 03:20.458
Simba...

03:21.208 --> 03:22.583
I'm here.

03:23.958 --> 03:25.250
I'm here.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.791
Security detail
has arrived!

03:40.958 --> 03:43.458
One gentle reminder:
we are not food.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.625
No, no, no, no, no.
We are just two guys

03:45.791 --> 03:48.083
walking to work through
a pride of hungry lions.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.958
Which is perfectly
normal. I'm not terrified.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.790
Security detail
reporting for duty,

03:53.791 --> 03:55.500
Your Grace, Your Highness...

03:55.666 --> 03:58.083
Ruler of all
four-legged creatures.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.458
And that one
three-legged zebra.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.875
Oh, right, Ron.
That was tragic.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.333
- It was an eat-and-Ron.
- Yeah.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.415
Ron has three legs.
That's still one more than me.

04:06.416 --> 04:07.624
- Well, are those arms or legs?
-  Guys.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.707
I don't know.
I think they're paws.

04:08.708 --> 04:09.790
Guys.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.416
- I consider all those legs.
- Guys! This is serious.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.500
I need you to stay with Kiara
until I get back.

04:14.666 --> 04:17.415
Are you saying
that your security detail

04:17.416 --> 04:20.291
has been called on
to do babysitting?

04:20.458 --> 04:21.874
Pumbaa, we should
really discuss this

04:21.875 --> 04:23.375
because I don't really love...

04:23.541 --> 04:26.000
Guys, I promised her
everything would be okay.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.291
Well, that's one way
to parent.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.500
She's gonna
have to grow up sometime.

04:28.666 --> 04:29.665
What else did you tell her,

04:29.666 --> 04:31.250
that she could be
whatever she wants to be?

04:31.416 --> 04:32.458
That life is fair?

04:32.625 --> 04:34.916
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

04:35.083 --> 04:38.125
Don't scare Kiara.
And most of all, no stories.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.749
- No stories?
- Wait a second.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.832
I know where your head goes.

04:40.833 --> 04:42.458
I grew up with you two.
Promise me.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.999
Okay. You know what,
you know what, you know what?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.416
Fine. No stories.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.958
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.165
No. Pssh.
We'll tell a story anyway.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.415
Okay, we'll tell
him that we're not gonna

04:50.416 --> 04:51.499
tell a story and then
we're gonna tell a story.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.791
- He can't stop us.
- Are you guys serious?

04:52.958 --> 04:54.500
I'm clearly within earshot.

04:54.666 --> 04:55.791
Dad.

04:58.708 --> 05:00.333
Hey, little one.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.166
Dad, the storm's coming,
and I'm scared.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.833
I wanna go with you and Mom.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.541
- Don't be scared, my love.
- Mmm.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.750
Timon and Pumbaa
will watch you while I'm gone.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.375
Be brave now, Kiara.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.000
Be brave.

05:18.458 --> 05:21.082
Okay!
We've prepared a story.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.625
<i>Scar looked at us.</i>

05:24.791 --> 05:26.875
<i>He knew it was
the end of the line.</i>

05:27.041 --> 05:28.875
<i>I could smell the fear.</i>

05:29.041 --> 05:31.166
<i>That was actually me,
but yes.</i>

05:48.833 --> 05:50.791
<i>So you two
defeated Scar?</i>

05:50.958 --> 05:52.041
And then you ate him?

05:52.208 --> 05:54.208
Honestly, one of the best
meals I ever had.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.291
My dad told me
he defeated Scar.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.832
Well, okay. But your dad,

05:57.833 --> 05:59.416
as we all know,
is a pathological liar.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.666
He's always lyin'. Get it?

06:05.291 --> 06:07.333
I'm scared.
I want Mom and Dad.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.625
Look, look, look
look, look.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.416
Don't be scared, Kiara.

06:10.583 --> 06:14.000
How about we sing you a song?
And, a-one...

06:14.166 --> 06:16.666
Pumbaa, no, it is
way too early for the song.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.832
It worked on Simba.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.291
He thought he had
murdered his own father.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.291
He was singin' and dancin'
around in seconds.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.874
I can't just
turn it on like that.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.416
I have to be in the moment.

06:24.583 --> 06:25.791
He sang that song
for six years straight.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.375
Well, who didn't?

06:27.541 --> 06:28.665
Look!

06:28.666 --> 06:29.874
- No!
- It's Ron,

06:29.875 --> 06:31.957
the three-legged zebra.
Run for your lives!

06:31.958 --> 06:33.333
He heard what we've been
sayin' about him.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.291
We're sorry, Ron. They were
jokes. They were just jokes!

06:36.666 --> 06:37.916
It's Rafiki.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.915
Rafiki! Rafiki!

06:42.250 --> 06:44.833
Little one,
there's no reason to cry.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
My parents...

06:46.541 --> 06:47.540
they're gone.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.208
Hey. Look out there, <i>mdogo.</i>

06:50.708 --> 06:53.250
You see those baobab trees
blowing in the wind?

06:53.750 --> 06:58.041
The roots of those trees are
very strong, like your family.

06:58.208 --> 07:00.083
And, just as they did for you,

07:00.250 --> 07:03.750
your parents have gone to the
ceremonial birthing grounds.

07:03.916 --> 07:06.915
And when they return,
the Circle of Life

07:06.916 --> 07:10.041
will bring a blessing
to you, Kiara,

07:10.208 --> 07:12.540
that you will never forget.

07:12.541 --> 07:13.624
Man, he's good.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.458
He's such
a visual storyteller.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.708
Yet it makes sense
that he lives alone.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.749
I just want the storm to pass,

07:20.750 --> 07:22.999
and then I promise
to be brave.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.708
I'll tell you a secret.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.250
When your father Simba
was your age,

07:28.416 --> 07:30.249
he was afraid of the thunder

07:30.250 --> 07:32.250
and would hide
behind the king.

07:32.416 --> 07:33.625
When did he stop hiding?

07:33.791 --> 07:35.875
One day, during a big storm,

07:36.041 --> 07:38.790
your grandfather Mufasa
took your father

07:38.791 --> 07:41.166
to the very top of Pride Rock,

07:41.333 --> 07:42.833
told him to stand with him

07:43.000 --> 07:44.875
and howl into the wind.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.833
And Simba slowly stepped out
with the king.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.333
And together,
they roared into the night.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.166
But I'm not brave like my dad.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.665
And I could never be
like Mufasa.

07:57.666 --> 08:00.458
Is that so?

08:01.375 --> 08:04.166
Then maybe it's time
I tell you a story.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.458
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

08:07.750 --> 08:11.125
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

08:11.583 --> 08:15.125
A lion who would change
our lives forever.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.833
A story! So glad
I brought some crickets.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.708
But go easy. We're in a cave.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.500
This story
begins far beyond

08:22.666 --> 08:24.500
the mountains and the shadows.

08:24.666 --> 08:26.458
On the other side
of the light.

08:26.625 --> 08:30.875
In this place, everything
was dying of thirst

08:31.041 --> 08:33.289
as 20 full moons
had passed without

08:33.291 --> 08:35.541
a single drop of water.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.457
But when the skies
finally opened,

08:39.207 --> 08:41.875
destiny would reign.

09:10.625 --> 09:11.625
Mufasa.

09:12.666 --> 09:15.208
Mufasa! Come see.

09:21.041 --> 09:23.833
Mom, what is that light
way out there?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.666
Oh, that's very special.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.458
Beyond the horizon,

09:28.625 --> 09:31.750
beyond the last cloud
in the sky,

09:31.916 --> 09:34.708
that's a place we call <i>Milele.</i>

09:34.875 --> 09:35.916
<i>Milele?</i>

09:36.083 --> 09:38.375
Hmm. It means, "forever."

09:39.291 --> 09:41.625
Imagine
a kingdom full of life,

09:42.458 --> 09:44.416
water and food,

09:44.583 --> 09:48.375
grass and sky
as far as the eye can see.

09:48.541 --> 09:49.666
Will we ever go there?

09:49.833 --> 09:51.291
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.458
That's exactly
where we're headed.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.625
But we can also
be there right now.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.708
We can close our eyes.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.166
Let our dreams take us.

Rain. Rain!

12:19.083 --> 12:21.207
Oh, finally we have rain!

12:24.541 --> 12:27.790
Dad, race you to the light!

12:27.791 --> 12:29.041
You're too fast.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.791
I've never beaten you.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.708
Nobody has ever beaten you.

12:33.541 --> 12:34.541
I know!

12:35.125 --> 12:39.040
Mufasa!
Fastest cub in the world.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.416
Thank you.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.166
Mufasa...

13:13.291 --> 13:14.290
that's enough.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.000
Mufasa, come back now.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.250
Mufasa, stay there!
I'm coming, son.

13:40.666 --> 13:42.458
-  Father!
- Mufasa!

13:49.250 --> 13:50.250
Mufasa?

13:51.208 --> 13:52.875
I'll catch you on the turn.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.458
Find my voice.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.250
Find my voice!

13:56.416 --> 13:57.583
Mom!

14:06.875 --> 14:10.208
Mufasa, the cliff is too high,
but you can cross at the dam.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.583
Come on, Mufasa,
you can do this.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.291
Find your mother's voice.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.291
Listen
to your father, Mufasa!

14:16.458 --> 14:17.791
Listen to us!

14:20.833 --> 14:21.875
Afia, he's there.

14:22.541 --> 14:24.166
-  Mom!
-  He's there!

14:24.625 --> 14:26.125
-  Mother!
- Mufasa!

14:28.750 --> 14:30.958
Find your footing
one step at a time.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.457
-  I can't.
- You can do this.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.708
I'm right here.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.166
Mufasa!

15:41.916 --> 15:43.791
Mom?

15:44.416 --> 15:45.416
Dad?

15:46.500 --> 15:47.583
Can you hear me?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.375
Is anyone out there?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Mom?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.083
Please.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.750
I'm scared.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.625
I'm scared.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.541
<i>The floodwaters
joined a distant river,</i>

16:10.708 --> 16:14.458
<i>carried Mufasa far
from his mother and father.</i>

16:14.625 --> 16:16.750
<i>Beyond all that he knew.</i>

16:44.291 --> 16:46.207
Hello.

16:46.208 --> 16:49.166
I'm Taka, son of Obasi.
What's your name?

16:49.333 --> 16:50.458
Mufasa.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.333
I'm not allowed
to talk to Outsiders,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.208
but I have a secret...

16:54.375 --> 16:56.375
...and I really
want to tell you.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.375
- What's the secret?
-  I'll get in trouble.

16:58.541 --> 16:59.541
Please, just tell me.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.333
Uh... I don't know.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.541
Just tell me!

17:02.708 --> 17:04.874
Okay.
You're about to be eaten.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.250
I hate secrets!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.540
- Swim!
- But I can't!

17:12.708 --> 17:14.333
- You have to swim.
- I don't know how!

17:14.583 --> 17:17.583
All right. Chin up, then walk
underwater really fast.

17:17.750 --> 17:18.958
I can't!

17:19.125 --> 17:21.583
Come on, Mufasa. Faster!

17:23.290 --> 17:25.290
Help me, Taka! Help me!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.375
I told you to wait for me.

17:40.541 --> 17:41.833
It's not my fault, Mum.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.500
I came down for a drink
and saw him floating by.

17:44.666 --> 17:46.625
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

17:46.791 --> 17:48.499
You're lucky
those crocs were young

17:48.500 --> 17:50.291
and afraid to fight. Let's go!

17:50.458 --> 17:51.958
We can't just leave him here.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.875
Rules are rules, Taka.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.375
Obasi will never accept
a stray.

17:56.541 --> 18:00.291
I'm not a stray.
I'm just... lost.

18:00.458 --> 18:01.458
See?

18:02.375 --> 18:03.875
He's just lost.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.291
There was a...
a flood.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.083
My parents,
they tried to save me.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.666
Do you know which way is home?

18:15.458 --> 18:16.541
Home?

18:16.791 --> 18:19.666
To be lost
is to learn the way.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.750
Call me Eshe.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.000
I'm tired, Eshe.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.124
Come on, it's this way.

18:42.750 --> 18:43.958
Come on, Mufasa.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.958
Is this <i>Milele?</i>

18:55.833 --> 18:57.166
No, my love.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.083
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.583
The all-important nap
of kings,

19:07.750 --> 19:10.375
only to be awoken
by the disgusting,

19:10.541 --> 19:13.125
hideous, revolting stench
of a stray.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.416
When we come upon an Outsider,

19:14.583 --> 19:16.958
tell me, what do we do?

19:17.125 --> 19:18.875
Obasi, I know.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.041
Eat it.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.958
But I found him, Dad.
I saved his life.

19:23.125 --> 19:26.666
Taka, we do not associate
with Outsiders.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.666
The only true bond is blood.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.750
I've heard stories of lions
twice our size.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.500
These Outsiders

19:34.666 --> 19:37.041
will devour everything
in their path.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.708
Does he look like he's going
to devour you?

19:40.875 --> 19:43.791
Whoa, that smell
is disgusting.

19:43.958 --> 19:46.125
I'm not even sure I could eat
this <i>kibeti!</i>

19:46.291 --> 19:48.208
I'm not a <i>kibeti.</i>
I'm a Mufasa.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.374
Do you even know
what "Mufasa" means?

19:50.375 --> 19:51.833
-  No.
- It means, "king."

19:52.291 --> 19:53.416
And that's me.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.000
You better start running,
little Mufasa,

19:56.166 --> 19:57.166
for your life.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.375
If I run,
you'll never catch me.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.000
I'm the fastest cub
that ever lived.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.207
My father told me so.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.916
Ooh, Taka,
you have a challenge.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.625
They will race
to the dead tree and back.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.750
And when the prince
defeats him,

20:09.916 --> 20:12.375
I will finish him in one bite.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.500
What if Mufasa wins?

20:14.708 --> 20:17.958
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.333
He stays with me.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.291
You have my word.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.833
Let the race begin!

20:26.541 --> 20:28.583
Ooh, clumsy little stray.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.166
Run, Mufasa!

20:30.625 --> 20:31.916
You did not have to do that.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.916
Taka
is the future king.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.000
He has to win
his first challenge.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.375
No, Obasi. To be a true king,
he must earn it.

20:39.541 --> 20:41.041
Don't take that away from him.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.416
Better hurry.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.541
I have one more secret,
Mufasa.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.166
I always wanted a brother.

22:26.041 --> 22:27.958
- Cheater!
- Obasi!

22:28.125 --> 22:31.000
You will keep him
with the females.

22:31.166 --> 22:36.500
Taka, how could you lose
to a stray?

22:37.416 --> 22:38.583
Well done, Taka.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.541
Well done.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.791
I thought you said
you were fast.

22:42.958 --> 22:44.040
I had to let you win.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.124
Well, I did just go days

22:45.125 --> 22:46.207
with no sleep
while riding the waves of...

22:46.208 --> 22:48.832

Elephant stampede!

26:27.083 --> 26:29.291
Chigaru jumped,
like, 20 feet.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.625
Oh, that's a new record.

26:30.791 --> 26:32.916
Obasi,
they did it again.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.916
Your sons are nothing
but trouble.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.083
That one is not my son.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.166
They're heathens,
the both of them.

26:39.333 --> 26:42.541
This stray is forbidden
to be near the Shade Tree.

26:42.708 --> 26:43.958
Mufasa and I were
just playing.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.625
You two will
never be brothers.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.166
Now go back to the females

26:48.333 --> 26:51.041
and stay away from my son.

26:52.583 --> 26:55.000
Oh, your mother,
she adopts every lizard,

26:55.166 --> 26:57.500
speaks to passing
grasshoppers.

26:57.666 --> 26:58.666
I want to go with him.

26:58.833 --> 27:00.458
You want to be
with the females?

27:00.625 --> 27:02.208
You belong with the males.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.166
He gets to hunt with Mother.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.916
One day, he will betray you.

27:07.916 --> 27:09.666
That is what strays do.

27:09.833 --> 27:11.250
Mufasa would never betray me.

27:11.416 --> 27:12.708
Hey, hey.

27:12.875 --> 27:15.625
This will all be yours,
my son.

27:15.791 --> 27:18.125
You will be king.

27:18.291 --> 27:19.541
So pay attention.

27:20.416 --> 27:23.083
Study every move I make.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.083
Sleeping again.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.333
That is what males do.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.666
We protect the pride
as we nap.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.083
That's...

27:32.250 --> 27:34.041
Well, that's power.

27:37.875 --> 27:39.375
Power?

27:54.416 --> 27:55.583
Why are we stopping?

27:55.750 --> 27:57.416
Close your eyes.

27:57.916 --> 27:59.875
And tell me what you hear.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.750
What you feel.

28:07.541 --> 28:10.083
There's
a herd of antelope

28:10.291 --> 28:12.666
heading across
the dry lakebed.

28:12.833 --> 28:15.541
About half a day from here?

28:15.750 --> 28:17.791
And how do you know
they're not gazelles?

28:18.958 --> 28:21.041
Their steps
are too heavy.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.541
- Moving way too slow.
-  What else?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.125
Come on. You can do it.

28:26.291 --> 28:32.000
When the wind
hits their horns, it moves up

28:32.166 --> 28:36.041
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.708
Very good.

28:43.791 --> 28:46.125
What is it, Mufasa?
What's wrong?

28:46.291 --> 28:48.125
Sometimes I get a scent.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.666
It's barely a trace
on the wind.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.416
And it smells like home.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Then it's gone.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.958
Mufasa, your parents
are still out there.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.166
We can keep looking.

29:02.333 --> 29:03.541
I lost them, Eshe.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.833
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.875
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

29:09.041 --> 29:11.250
Obasi will never accept me.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.916
I'll never be his blood.
His family.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.291
But you are my family.

29:15.458 --> 29:18.541
And if Obasi could see
how gifted you are...

29:18.708 --> 29:21.583
Well, maybe I like being
a stray, you know.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.291
No rules, no responsibility.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.958
I'm the lucky one,
Eshe.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.500
What do you mean, Mufasa?

29:27.666 --> 29:29.666
I never have to be like Taka.

29:30.541 --> 29:32.291
I never have to be king.

29:45.458 --> 29:47.625
Did he say, "no rules
and no responsibility"?

29:47.791 --> 29:50.125
An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.666
Which means he smells like me.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.083
Which is not good.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.125
Well, either way, I think that
means that he's one of us.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.000
-  This is it.
- It's our time!

29:58.166 --> 29:59.165
This is our moment.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.291

and a-two and a-one, two...

Don't go there.

30:14.333 --> 30:15.749
All right, all right,
Rafiki's right.

30:15.750 --> 30:16.833
We'll get letters from legal.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.708
Those vultures will take
everything we have.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.625
Which, technically,
is nothing.

30:20.791 --> 30:22.000
Look at us.
We're naked animals.

30:22.166 --> 30:23.458
No wonder I'm always freezing.

30:23.625 --> 30:24.624
They want this!

30:24.625 --> 30:25.708
Come on, Pumbaa.

30:25.833 --> 30:26.833
Let's bring it home.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.291

30:28.458 --> 30:29.458

30:29.916 --> 30:31.833
Kiara's a music snob.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.916
Rafiki, keep going.

30:36.166 --> 30:37.499
<i>Later that day,</i>

30:37.500 --> 30:41.375
<i>Eshe was teaching Mufasa
how to hunt in pairs.</i>

30:41.625 --> 30:45.541
<i>But, as Taka was
secretly watching,</i>

30:45.708 --> 30:48.125
<i>something terrible
was hunting them.</i>

31:43.541 --> 31:44.625
Mufasa, run!

31:46.958 --> 31:48.000
Eshe!

31:48.791 --> 31:49.791
Mother.

31:51.041 --> 31:52.041
Mother!

31:53.250 --> 31:54.250
Eshe!

32:10.208 --> 32:11.375
Keep moving, Mufasa.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.166
They go for the neck!

32:32.541 --> 32:34.000
It's okay, Mufasa.

32:34.791 --> 32:37.250
It's okay.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.833
It's okay.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.500
That was very brave of you,
Mufasa.

32:41.666 --> 32:42.666
Thank you.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.291
Eshe...

32:51.458 --> 32:52.833
What has happened?

32:53.833 --> 32:56.291
Are you hurt?

32:57.500 --> 33:00.458
They were huge.
White as ghosts.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.125
Like nothing I've seen before.

33:04.375 --> 33:05.791
Oh, Obasi.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.625
Had Mufasa
not been there, I...

33:14.583 --> 33:15.583
Taka.

33:25.291 --> 33:29.291
I owe you
a great debt, Mufasa.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.791
We need to prepare.

33:31.958 --> 33:34.541
They're downwind
less than a day away.

33:35.833 --> 33:36.833
No.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.875
You couldn't possibly
know this.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.291
Send a scout and you'll see...

33:42.000 --> 33:43.708
they'll be coming for us.

33:44.916 --> 33:45.916
Chigaru.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.458
Father, please,
let me explain.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.458
No. Not now.

33:54.541 --> 33:55.958
Taka, come.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.208
Where is my son?

34:18.375 --> 34:20.291
There was a young lion,
Majesty.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.666
He fought Shaju.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.833
And yet you came back.

34:27.125 --> 34:28.833
You survived.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.083
I was badly hurt. I promise,
Majesty. This is the truth.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.456
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.915
The truth is standing
behind you.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.666
- There were others, Majesty.
- No, no, no.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.625
But only one left blood
on his mane.

34:46.791 --> 34:49.208
Which means
he left Shaju to die.

34:49.375 --> 34:50.666
Saved himself.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.708
This young lion,
was he their king?

34:53.875 --> 34:55.333
His blood is common. Ordinary.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.500
Answer me!

34:57.083 --> 34:59.708
Was he their king?

34:59.875 --> 35:04.375
No, Kiros,
you are the only king.

35:04.541 --> 35:07.583
An ordinary lion?

35:07.750 --> 35:10.583
And you left my son to die?

35:10.750 --> 35:12.625
I was injured.
There was no choice.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.833
Please, Majesty,
you have to believe me.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.083
There's no reason to fear me.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.708
I would never harm
one of my own.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.000
Thank you, Majesty.

35:22.833 --> 35:24.750
I'll leave that pleasure

35:24.916 --> 35:25.916
to them.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.541
Majesty! No. Kiros!

35:30.333 --> 35:31.333
Kiros!

35:41.500 --> 35:43.457
<i>No one
can ever know you ran.</i>

35:43.458 --> 35:45.250
<i>That you ran from your mother.</i>

35:46.125 --> 35:48.458
It never happened, Taka.
Do you understand?

35:48.625 --> 35:50.708
But I didn't know. I was
just... I was just scared.

35:51.208 --> 35:54.833
It doesn't matter.
We must protect the bloodline.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.083
Protect it with a lie?
Father, that's deceitful.

35:58.250 --> 36:02.416
Deceit is a tool
of a great king.

36:03.958 --> 36:04.958
Taka...

36:05.875 --> 36:08.875
it's what kings must do.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.666
But I'm not a king.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.416
I'm just your son.

36:12.875 --> 36:13.875
Obasi!

36:14.875 --> 36:16.125
Chigaru.

36:16.291 --> 36:17.291
Obasi!

36:17.875 --> 36:21.625
Chigaru, I'm here.
What did you see?

36:21.791 --> 36:23.291
They're coming
this way, Obasi.

36:23.458 --> 36:25.375
Two lions
for every one of ours.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.208
Each one bigger than the next,

36:27.375 --> 36:31.333
but none as mighty as Kiros,
their terrifying king.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.291
Outsiders.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.750
The stories were all true.

36:36.708 --> 36:39.000
I must protect
the bloodline, Eshe.

36:39.166 --> 36:41.041
The future of this pride.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.041
Taka, you are that future.

36:44.208 --> 36:46.041
Future? Dad, what do you mean?

36:46.875 --> 36:48.250
I'm sending you away.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.333
Far from here.

36:51.166 --> 36:55.291
You will leave and start a new
life, a new beginning.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.625
I need you to go with him,
Mufasa,

36:57.791 --> 36:59.416
to pledge your loyalty.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.958
They'll arrive
with the sunrise.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.083
Where will we go, Eshe?

37:12.250 --> 37:13.708
Without you, I have no home.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.958
Mufasa, you and Taka together.
That...

37:17.916 --> 37:19.000
- That is home.
- Eshe...

37:19.166 --> 37:20.833
Mufasa, look out there.

37:21.458 --> 37:22.583
Beyond the light...

37:22.750 --> 37:24.041
You know what I see?

37:24.208 --> 37:26.582
I see the place your mother
told you about,

37:26.583 --> 37:28.833
a place beyond
the river's end.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.749
Across the deepest canyon

37:30.750 --> 37:32.291
on the other side
of the mountains,

37:32.458 --> 37:34.875
a place beyond
the horizon itself.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.208
A pride land so green,

37:37.750 --> 37:40.208
so perfect

37:40.708 --> 37:43.416
that to see it is to see

37:43.583 --> 37:44.750
<i>Milele.</i>

37:44.916 --> 37:47.500
Yes. Forever.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.540
My parents spoke
of <i>Milele</i> often.

37:49.541 --> 37:51.750
My mother told me
it was where we were going.

37:51.916 --> 37:53.416
And don't you see, Mufasa?

37:53.583 --> 37:54.708
You must keep going.

37:54.875 --> 37:57.125
You must continue your journey
toward the light.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.125
Please, Eshe.
I can't lose you.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.916
You have my love
always, Mufasa.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.958
But your family is still out
there, waiting for you.

38:06.125 --> 38:07.666
I can feel their presence.

38:07.833 --> 38:09.500
And I know you can, too.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.500
Go.

38:12.125 --> 38:15.250
Go, Mufasa.
Find your way home.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.750
Mother, please forgive me.
I beg you.

38:26.916 --> 38:29.125
There's no need, my love.

38:29.291 --> 38:32.166
Taka, your moment of courage
will come.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.250
Now both of you go.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.250
Go and find your place

38:45.666 --> 38:47.250
in the Circle of Life.

39:05.083 --> 39:08.000
They left their family
never to see them again?

39:08.166 --> 39:09.333
This story is killing me.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.041
It's toying with my emotions.

39:11.208 --> 39:12.666
And here
is the worst part.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.541
- What's that?
- I'm out of crickets.

39:14.708 --> 39:15.958
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

39:16.125 --> 39:17.666
I need a bathroom break
before the second act.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.291
Everyone wait for me.

39:24.541 --> 39:25.541
I am back.

39:25.708 --> 39:26.915
Pumbaa, did you wash
your hooves?

39:26.916 --> 39:27.999
Mm-hmm.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.250
- Pumbaa?
- I did. I did.

39:29.416 --> 39:30.666
-  Pumbaa?
- I'm just gonna walk

39:30.833 --> 39:32.416
- on them again right after.
- Pumbaa?

39:34.583 --> 39:37.000
Rafiki,
did the Outsiders come?

39:37.166 --> 39:38.166
Yes.

39:38.333 --> 39:41.083
And as the hunters led Kiros
into the Valley of Kings,

39:41.333 --> 39:44.625
<i>Obasi and Eshe
stood their ground.</i>

39:57.250 --> 40:00.416
Which one of you is king?

40:00.583 --> 40:03.541
You have no reason
to challenge me.

40:03.708 --> 40:08.208
Does this look
like a challenge, King?

40:08.458 --> 40:11.041
There are rules among lions.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.375
Not anymore.

40:13.208 --> 40:16.041
While you ruled this pride,
I've built my army.

40:16.708 --> 40:18.041
Yours is the last pride

40:18.208 --> 40:21.166
in the Valley of Kings,
which means

40:21.333 --> 40:25.208
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

40:25.375 --> 40:27.041
There will be one ruler.

40:27.208 --> 40:29.833

42:46.000 --> 42:48.541
We have to move.
They'll be tracking us.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.583
- Taka!
-  What if you're wrong?

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
What if they're okay?

42:52.125 --> 42:54.416
They live in you now.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.416
Follow me, brother.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.458
We have to move...

42:59.375 --> 43:00.583
together.

43:25.291 --> 43:26.791
Run, Mufasa.

43:27.708 --> 43:29.500
Run!

43:30.750 --> 43:31.750
Hunters.

43:31.916 --> 43:33.916
-  What's the plan?
-  Uh...

43:34.291 --> 43:36.541
Run! Very fast!

43:42.083 --> 43:43.541
This way!

43:58.166 --> 43:59.416
Back to the trees.

43:59.583 --> 44:01.250
We're trapped.
We have to swim.

44:01.416 --> 44:02.833
No, we have to fight.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.458
If we fight, we die.

44:04.625 --> 44:06.000
But if we swim, we drown.

44:06.166 --> 44:08.250
Okay, I didn't
want to do this,

44:08.416 --> 44:10.500
- but I command you to swim!
- You what?

44:10.666 --> 44:13.291
You pledged your loyalty.
I command you to swim.

44:13.458 --> 44:15.958
Taka, this is not the time
for jokes.

44:30.541 --> 44:33.083
Which one of you
killed my son?

44:33.250 --> 44:34.832
I did.
This lion with me is nothing

44:34.833 --> 44:36.415
but a stray. Let him go.

44:36.416 --> 44:38.208
Kiros, the other is no stray.

44:38.375 --> 44:40.125
He holds the blood
of the pride.

44:41.666 --> 44:44.208
The last blood
of the king? Hmm.

44:45.458 --> 44:48.207
Blood for blood.

45:04.666 --> 45:05.958
They're coming!

45:06.583 --> 45:07.708
What do we do?

45:07.875 --> 45:09.166
We find the advantage?

45:09.333 --> 45:10.374
What advantage?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.916
We're on a rock
in the middle of the water!

45:13.750 --> 45:16.416
Taka, this is it.
We go for the king.

45:25.916 --> 45:27.083
Mufasa, I'm ready.

45:27.875 --> 45:29.416
Just one last thing.

45:29.583 --> 45:30.625
- What?
- Chin up!

45:31.625 --> 45:33.333
Taka!

45:33.583 --> 45:36.249
This was a bad idea.

45:45.041 --> 45:46.374
Mufasa!

45:46.375 --> 45:47.624
Mufasa!

45:55.208 --> 45:56.415
-  Mufasa...
- Yeah!

45:56.416 --> 45:57.499
- We're alive.
- Ah!

45:57.500 --> 45:59.791
I did it. I saved us.

46:02.625 --> 46:04.083
You were saying?

46:32.291 --> 46:34.333
Okay. Okay.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.208
No... No more water.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.416
Tell me you can track them
down river.

46:38.583 --> 46:40.833
We can track them anywhere.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.583
They can run,
but they can't hide.

46:44.958 --> 46:47.291
So just to be clear,
we're not in this story?

46:47.458 --> 46:48.749
It feels a little bit like

46:48.750 --> 46:50.750
Kiros is stealing
my thunder here.

46:50.916 --> 46:52.916
Yeah. You know,
I don't feel seen.

46:53.166 --> 46:54.707
No. There's a lotta stories
with all of us.

46:54.708 --> 46:55.790
Tell one of those!

46:55.791 --> 46:57.625
Can I make
one small suggestion?

46:57.791 --> 47:00.375
Less childhood trauma,
more meerkat.

47:00.541 --> 47:03.250
Rafiki, I know
who Taka's gonna be.

47:03.416 --> 47:06.000
Oh. Me too. It's so obvious.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.833
But maybe, just so we're on
the same page, tell me?

47:08.000 --> 47:09.708
- Is it Simba? Is it me?
- Pumbaa.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.666
Oh, wait. Am I Obasi?

47:11.833 --> 47:12.832
That makes no sense.

47:12.833 --> 47:14.041
But seriously,
I have one question.

47:15.708 --> 47:17.125
Am I Taka?

47:17.541 --> 47:20.875
♪ I did
it again, I did it again ♪

47:21.250 --> 47:24.915
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your hide. Again!

47:24.916 --> 47:27.499
As much as
it kills you to say it,

47:27.500 --> 47:29.125
let's hear a little,
"Thank you, Taka."

47:29.291 --> 47:31.415
You want me
to thank you

47:31.416 --> 47:33.083
for pushing me
off a waterfall?

47:33.250 --> 47:35.582
Yes, and you're welcome.

47:35.583 --> 47:36.832
Look, it's not my fault

47:36.833 --> 47:38.249
crocodiles are simply
attracted to you.

47:38.250 --> 47:40.499
Don't...
Don't say that.

47:43.708 --> 47:46.708
♪ I did
it again, I did it...

47:48.125 --> 47:49.416
Mufasa.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.833
Is it them?
Is it the Outsiders?

47:52.000 --> 47:53.875
No.
She's right there.

47:54.041 --> 47:55.166
"She"?

47:57.625 --> 47:59.291
There's no place to run.

47:59.458 --> 48:00.875
We have your scent.

48:01.166 --> 48:02.207
My scent?

48:02.208 --> 48:04.708
I've been stalking
you two all night.

48:05.166 --> 48:06.708
That's not possible.

48:06.875 --> 48:08.333
Then
why did I circle you

48:08.500 --> 48:09.750
three times in this wood

48:09.916 --> 48:12.125
while you two were
chasing each other's tails?

48:31.625 --> 48:33.250
Uh... That's embarrassing.

48:33.791 --> 48:37.166
Yeah, well, I, uh,
meant to do that, so...

48:37.333 --> 48:39.250
Still think I'm afraid?

48:41.833 --> 48:42.999
Why are you
following us?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.415
I was hoping to find my pride.

48:44.416 --> 48:45.499
What happened to them?

48:45.500 --> 48:46.583
The Outsiders
happened.

48:47.041 --> 48:48.124
A few of us got away,

48:48.125 --> 48:50.833
but you're the only
other lions I've seen.

48:52.083 --> 48:53.083
You two better keep moving.

48:53.250 --> 48:54.500
Wait! Please.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.916
Um... My name is Taka.

48:58.083 --> 48:59.791
Son of Obasi.

48:59.958 --> 49:01.625
I know what it's like
to lose everything.

49:01.791 --> 49:03.041
Come with us. We can help you.

49:03.208 --> 49:04.791
I don't need any help.

49:04.958 --> 49:07.083
But you don't have anyone.

49:07.250 --> 49:09.875
She does indeed have someone.
Thank you very much.

49:10.041 --> 49:12.250
That's Zazu. Don't eat him.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.875
You heard her. Do not eat me.

49:14.041 --> 49:16.833
As a recent addition
to the King's Royal Guard,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.791
I must kindly ask you both
to move on.

49:19.958 --> 49:21.708
Thank you for stopping by.

49:21.875 --> 49:23.916
Your king hired a bird
to protect you?

49:24.208 --> 49:25.791
How high can you fly?

49:26.000 --> 49:28.625
- Mmm.
- Look, I needed a scout.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.375
Zazu was the last option.

49:30.541 --> 49:32.083
Well, next to last.

49:32.250 --> 49:34.083
Between Albert the Iguana
and I,

49:34.250 --> 49:37.833
His Majesty decided
on the underling with wings.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.791
And thus, I became the
lead scout for the princess.

49:40.958 --> 49:42.499
It's my third day,
going swimmingly,

49:42.500 --> 49:43.750
if I may say so myself.

49:43.916 --> 49:45.208
Sarabi, you can
say so as well.

49:45.375 --> 49:46.958
How far do you think
you'll get with a bird?

49:47.125 --> 49:49.082
How far do you two geniuses
think you'll get

49:49.083 --> 49:51.000
stumbling around,
running into each other?

49:51.166 --> 49:53.083
All the way to <i>Milele.</i>

49:53.250 --> 49:55.041
<i>- Milele</i> is nothing but a myth.
- It's not a myth.

49:55.208 --> 49:57.290
Circle of Life
and fairy tale herds.

49:57.291 --> 49:58.374
- You're chasing something...
- Honestly.

49:58.375 --> 49:59.457
- ...that doesn't exist.
- As If.

49:59.458 --> 50:02.000
I don't know that <i>Milele</i>
exists, but right now,

50:02.166 --> 50:03.333
it's the only hope we have.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.333
We don't need hope.
We need food.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.957
Um...
Good job, brother.

50:09.958 --> 50:11.915
Oh, real nice.

50:11.916 --> 50:14.333
There's trouble in the trees.
My first real trouble,

50:14.500 --> 50:15.999
and I am going to pass.
Not going.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.500
I am staying right here,
thank you.

50:17.666 --> 50:20.875
Come on, Sarabi. Looks like
there's dinner headed our way.

50:21.416 --> 50:23.125
Sarabi, if I may.

50:23.583 --> 50:26.375
He makes a valid point,
Your Highness.

50:26.666 --> 50:28.499
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion,

50:28.500 --> 50:30.458
he wants to eat me,
so I am slightly torn.

50:33.750 --> 50:35.915
I think that went quite well,
all things considered.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.500
<i>And now, Kiara,
this is where I come in.</i>

50:58.500 --> 50:59.500
Rafiki.

51:00.041 --> 51:02.708
Order! We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.874
Tonight, a cheetah
came into our trees

51:04.875 --> 51:06.333
for the third night in a row.

51:06.500 --> 51:07.833
Almost took one of our own.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
It was Rafiki's fault.

51:09.291 --> 51:11.250
He summoned the beast
with his dreams.

51:11.416 --> 51:12.665
Rafiki
and his visions

51:12.666 --> 51:14.791
must be banished
once and for all.

51:14.958 --> 51:16.125
Rafiki tried to warn you.

51:16.291 --> 51:17.957
His dreams
conjure our enemies.

51:17.958 --> 51:20.000
He talks to the spirits,
summons the devil.

51:20.166 --> 51:21.165
What are you talking about?

51:21.166 --> 51:22.291
He's
done it before.

51:22.458 --> 51:24.416
His brother was chased
from these very trees,

51:24.583 --> 51:25.708
never to be seen again.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.083
Rafiki was just a child.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.749
A child born with a leg that
does not work.

51:29.750 --> 51:30.833
Yet somehow, he survived?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.458
It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

51:33.625 --> 51:35.958
Who healed you, Inaki,
when you were sick.

51:36.125 --> 51:39.208
He speaks to the insects,
converses with the moon.

51:39.375 --> 51:40.832
Zala, you know
what will happen

51:40.833 --> 51:42.333
if you send him
down from the trees.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.291
He is <i>amelaaniwa!</i>

51:44.458 --> 51:45.458
A curse to us all.

51:45.625 --> 51:46.624
That's not true.

51:46.625 --> 51:47.707
He doesn't
belong here.

51:47.708 --> 51:50.666
All in favor of banishment,
cover one eye.

51:51.250 --> 51:52.416
How can you
trust him?

51:52.583 --> 51:54.375
Don't trust him,
and I don't trust his magic!

51:54.541 --> 51:55.541
He doesn't
belong here.

51:55.666 --> 51:57.416
He's not a baboon.
And he never will be.

51:57.583 --> 51:59.000
He's not one of us.

51:59.166 --> 52:01.125
And so, it is time.

52:01.291 --> 52:02.583
No, wait.

52:03.208 --> 52:04.625
Where will you go?

52:04.791 --> 52:07.208
Where I should have gone
long ago.

52:07.375 --> 52:09.416
To find all that was lost.

52:10.083 --> 52:11.166
My family.

52:11.333 --> 52:13.458
You can't survive on your own.

52:13.625 --> 52:14.958
Nobody can.

52:15.125 --> 52:17.500
And yet, here we are.

52:19.458 --> 52:20.750
Oh, Rafiki.

52:20.916 --> 52:25.375
The eye never forgets
what the heart has seen.

52:45.708 --> 52:47.000
It's all right.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Hmm. <i>Jamaa.</i>

53:15.333 --> 53:16.333
Hmm.

53:20.750 --> 53:24.083
You can try to run, but I'm
afraid you won't get very far.

53:24.250 --> 53:26.041
And why would I run from you?

53:26.791 --> 53:28.750
Because we're lions.

53:28.916 --> 53:31.625
As in... [roaring] lions!

53:31.791 --> 53:34.249
A flea
can trouble a lion

53:34.250 --> 53:36.125
more than a lion
can trouble a flea.

53:36.291 --> 53:38.958
I don't think you understand
what's about to happen.

53:39.125 --> 53:40.625
There's no place
for you to go.

53:40.791 --> 53:42.583
I am going forward.

53:42.750 --> 53:44.166
I seriously doubt that.

53:44.333 --> 53:48.125
It is easy to doubt everything
when you know nothing.

53:48.291 --> 53:50.375
Can we get on
with this, please?

53:50.541 --> 53:53.833
If you take my life,
you will never find <i>Milele.</i>

53:54.000 --> 53:55.750
Wait, did you say <i>Milele?</i>

53:55.916 --> 53:58.750
That is where I'm going.
Toward the light.

53:58.916 --> 54:02.541
I have been there many times
in my dreams.

54:02.708 --> 54:04.708
My brother waits for me there.

54:04.875 --> 54:06.208
I've seen the tree.

54:06.375 --> 54:08.375
Can picture it. The two of us,

54:08.541 --> 54:10.041
together again.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.541
And why would anyone trust
a baboon's dream?

54:12.708 --> 54:14.958
Sometimes, a dream
is all you have.

54:15.125 --> 54:17.500
The only truth
that lives in you.

54:17.666 --> 54:20.125
Like the memory
of a great king.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.708
How did you know?

54:21.875 --> 54:25.166
Okay. Help us get to <i>Milele,</i>
and we will let you live.

54:25.333 --> 54:26.916
- Do we have a deal?
- No.

54:27.083 --> 54:28.250
What? Why?

54:28.416 --> 54:31.416
Rafiki will let you live.

54:31.583 --> 54:33.708
I've had enough of this!

54:33.875 --> 54:35.541
Taka, do not eat him.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.290
Wonderful.
Another misfit stray

54:37.291 --> 54:38.666
we're not supposed to eat.

54:38.833 --> 54:41.416
So, you expect us
to follow this baboon

54:41.583 --> 54:44.541
to a place nobody
has ever seen?

54:44.666 --> 54:47.166
- I'll be better off alone.
<i>- Hhe ntombazane.</i>

54:47.333 --> 54:49.750
A single stick may smoke,

54:49.916 --> 54:51.791
but it will never burn.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.458
Okay, now that
there's five of us,

54:56.625 --> 54:57.624
why don't we all go around

54:57.625 --> 54:59.208
and say a fun fact
about ourselves?

54:59.375 --> 55:00.375
I'll go first.

55:00.541 --> 55:03.500
I once had
a crush on a flamingo.

55:03.666 --> 55:05.666
I've never
said that out loud.

55:06.250 --> 55:07.291
And they're walking away.

55:07.458 --> 55:09.250
Yeah, places to go,
kingdoms to see.

55:09.416 --> 55:10.875
We're busy. Let's hustle.

55:20.958 --> 55:23.416
Wait, wait, wait. Now you're
the star of this thing?

55:23.583 --> 55:26.166
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

55:26.333 --> 55:28.625
All of a sudden, there's
a lotta Rafiki in this story.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.665
You even gave yourself
a long-lost brother.

55:30.666 --> 55:31.749
- Yeah.
-  What's next?

55:31.750 --> 55:32.832
A funny catchphrase?

55:32.833 --> 55:34.791
You gonna be fartin'
next? 'Cause that's my thing.

55:34.958 --> 55:37.333
You cannot tell the story
of Mufasa

55:37.500 --> 55:39.958
without the story of Rafiki.

55:40.125 --> 55:41.499
Oh, now he's even
talkin' about himself

55:41.500 --> 55:42.582
in the third person.

55:42.583 --> 55:43.916
Pretty soon, he'll have
his own fragrance.

55:44.083 --> 55:46.458
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

55:46.625 --> 55:48.166
It's called
"Pumbaa by Pumbaa,"

55:48.333 --> 55:50.833
and from what I hear,
it's pretty gross.

55:51.458 --> 55:52.958
Mom? Dad?

55:53.375 --> 55:55.750
If you can hear me, come home.

55:56.708 --> 55:57.875
Please.

55:58.291 --> 55:59.541
Come home.

56:07.291 --> 56:08.291
Mother?

56:10.666 --> 56:11.666
Mother?

56:15.708 --> 56:17.166
<i>Milele.</i>

56:17.500 --> 56:19.332
Mother!

56:37.208 --> 56:38.833
- Rafiki.
-  <i>Ayi suka.</i>

56:39.000 --> 56:40.666
- What are you doing?
- I am fishing.

56:40.833 --> 56:43.291
You're sitting on
a rock with your eyes closed.

56:43.458 --> 56:46.708
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

56:46.875 --> 56:49.250
Why am I talking to a baboon?

56:49.416 --> 56:53.166
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

56:53.333 --> 56:56.041
No offense,
but a monkey is a monkey.

56:56.208 --> 56:57.625
And a stray
is a stray.

56:57.791 --> 56:58.791
What's that supposed to mean?

56:58.916 --> 57:01.041
It means
we are very much the same.

57:01.208 --> 57:02.541
<i>Siyafana.</i>

57:02.708 --> 57:04.250
We are nothing alike.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.750
Take a good look. I am a lion.

57:07.916 --> 57:09.624
A lion
who fears water,

57:09.625 --> 57:11.291
fears his own reflection.

57:11.791 --> 57:13.499
Who can't sleep
because of what he sees

57:13.500 --> 57:15.250
when he closes his eyes.

57:15.416 --> 57:16.416
Huh?

57:16.583 --> 57:19.458
You are afraid
of your dreams, Mufasa.

57:19.625 --> 57:21.625
Afraid of what
you see in them.

57:21.791 --> 57:24.208
I see my parents.

57:24.916 --> 57:26.958
I feel them everywhere.

57:27.125 --> 57:28.916
Of course
you do, Mufasa.

57:29.708 --> 57:32.125
You will feel them forever.

57:32.541 --> 57:35.458
My mother, I hear her voice.

57:35.916 --> 57:39.625
She tells me that we are
on a journey to <i>Milele,</i>

57:39.833 --> 57:43.000
but I feel so lost
without her.

57:43.166 --> 57:46.625
Your journey
is not a dream, Mufasa.

57:46.791 --> 57:48.583
Your mother is guiding you,

57:48.875 --> 57:52.250
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

57:55.333 --> 58:00.249
<i>Ah... Ni heshima
kukutana nawe, binamu.</i>

58:00.250 --> 58:04.208
<i>Nenda kwa amani.
Ah...</i>

58:05.083 --> 58:06.250
What are you doing?

58:06.791 --> 58:07.791
We're starving.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.333
'Twas not its time.

58:09.583 --> 58:13.208
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.541
<i>Iketle Rafiki.
Iketle mosimane.</i>

58:23.583 --> 58:24.708
I have a report.

58:25.333 --> 58:26.458
It's morning.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.791
End of report.

58:36.541 --> 58:39.208
The earth divided
is now a choice.

58:39.416 --> 58:40.958
Around or down?

58:41.125 --> 58:43.250
The decision is yours.

58:46.125 --> 58:47.291
Mmm.

58:47.416 --> 58:50.208
Look out there,
beyond the light.

58:51.208 --> 58:53.791
Across the deepest canyon.

58:55.166 --> 58:57.208
"Across the deepest canyon."

58:57.916 --> 58:58.916
We should go down.

58:59.083 --> 59:01.500
Why? Because of some
fairy tale?

59:01.666 --> 59:03.041
The rocks
will hide our tracks.

59:03.208 --> 59:04.666
It's safer to go around.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.250
I picked up their scents.

59:06.416 --> 59:08.916
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

59:09.083 --> 59:10.166
I am a mandrill.

59:10.333 --> 59:11.708
This is a waste of time.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.291
Close your eyes.

59:13.833 --> 59:14.833
What?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.708
Tell me what you see.
What you feel.

59:17.875 --> 59:19.250
There's nothing on the wind.

59:19.416 --> 59:20.540
No, they're moving

59:20.541 --> 59:21.875
- through the bush willow.
- They, who?

59:22.041 --> 59:24.875
The females, out front.
Come on.

59:25.083 --> 59:27.125
Clear your thoughts.
Concentrate.

59:27.291 --> 59:29.333
I am concentrating.

59:41.083 --> 59:42.250
He's right.

59:43.958 --> 59:45.291
We have to go down.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.291
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

59:47.458 --> 59:49.416
<i>Ah! Uyabona mfana.</i>

59:49.625 --> 59:52.708
Now the many sticks
will make fire as one.

59:53.125 --> 59:55.791
Come on. We have places to go.

59:55.958 --> 59:58.208
And kingdoms to see.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.290
And kingdoms to see!

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.250

Kiros. They are not alone.

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.958
They've collected a lioness.

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.416
And a monkey.

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:05.541
Mufasa.

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:07.624
Mufasa.
You have to help me.

01:03:07.625 --> 01:03:08.708
Help you how?

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.166
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:12.416
She is the light
my mother spoke of.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:14.083
- What?
- She's special.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:16.750
The most amazing female
I've ever met in my life.

01:03:16.916 --> 01:03:18.165
I don't know
what to say to her.

01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:20.000
You've spent your life
with females.

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:22.041
Please, tell me what to say.

01:03:22.208 --> 01:03:24.416
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:25.750
No, Mufasa.

01:03:25.916 --> 01:03:26.915
You don't
understand.

01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.375
Myself isn't good enough.

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.916
You...

01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:32.250
just know things.

01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:34.708
Fine. Fine.

01:03:35.208 --> 01:03:37.791
Keep it simple.
Ask her a question.

01:03:37.958 --> 01:03:40.750
Right. A question.
This... This is good.

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:44.541
Yeah, try to be confident.
Disinterested.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:46.208
But I'm very interested.

01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:49.625
- Tell her about the flowers.
- What flowers?

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:53.250
The valley she comes from.
There's flowers everywhere.

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.375
They're called duck flowers.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.166
Long stems.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.500
It's absolutely beautiful.

01:04:00.208 --> 01:04:01.208
How do you know that?

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:04.416
When she passes,
I can smell them on her fur.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:05.875
Okay.

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.583
Flowers. Disinterested.

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:10.082
- Flowers. And disinterested.
- And here's the most

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:11.500
- important thing, okay?
-  Flowers.

01:04:11.666 --> 01:04:12.833
- And disinterested.
- Listen...

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.665
- Flowers and disinterested.
- ...when she speaks.

01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:15.874
Males have trouble
with that one.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:16.957
Flowers...

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:19.541
Sorry.
What did you say?

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:22.458
Really?

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:24.791
I heard you, brother.

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:27.166
I'm gonna make you proud.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.833
It's very hot,
isn't it?

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.291
Yep.

01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:46.750
I...
I love listening.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.041
Okay.

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:50.124
- I'm listening right now.
- To what?

01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:51.207
What you just said.

01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.290
You're the one that's talking.

01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:53.375
I am.

01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:56.166
- You smell like a duck.
- What?

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.332
Flower.

01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:59.791
Uh... A duck flower.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:02.082
How do you know
about those flowers?

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:03.374
I, uh...

01:05:03.375 --> 01:05:05.291
Well, I inhaled you
with my nose.

01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:06.958
I can smell them.

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:09.750
That's amazing.

01:05:09.916 --> 01:05:11.958
Our valley was
full of those flowers,

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:15.040
thousands of them
as far as the eye could see.

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:18.375
It was... It was the most
beautiful place, Taka.

01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:21.041
Did he just say
she smells like a duck?

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.708
And you call me a baboon?

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:40.208
They shouldn't be here.

01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.041
The migration patterns
are broken.

01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.666
- I... I don't understand...
- Outsiders!

01:05:43.833 --> 01:05:46.291
This is not a drill!
Just to be clear,

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.291
I never signed up for this.

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.958
It's okay. We're safe.

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.500
They're on the other side.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:56.291
Nope!

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:57.916
They can just jump across!

01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.541
We are trapped!

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:00.833
What do we do?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.375
The elephants
will fight with us.

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:03.541
And why would they do that?

01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:06.125
Because I'm going to ask them.

01:06:06.291 --> 01:06:07.666
Got a better idea?

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:10.666
Yes,
Mr. Ask-Questions-First.

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:11.875
Get ready to run.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:13.415
Uh...

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:14.833
Where is she going?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.750
Hello? Listen to me, please.
We need your help.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.290
Can you talk with me?

01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:20.707
We need your help. Please.

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:23.583
They're coming!

01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:26.583
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait!

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:29.250
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait. Wait!
Where is she going?

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.166
She's going for the hive!

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:36.833
Like I said, get ready to run!

01:06:48.833 --> 01:06:50.041
Run!

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:52.125
Get to the trees!

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:56.083
Why am I running?

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:25.083
Uh, Your Highness,
hold on!

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.833
Zazu!

01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:37.749
Sarabi!

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.166
Stand your ground!

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:54.915
Do not retreat!

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.583
I got you.

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:16.207
I got you.

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:19.291
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:29.415
That's right.
Run along, little kitty cats.

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:34.207
Thank you, my friend.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.707
Ah!

01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:53.332
Over here.

01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:01.250
Ah...

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.207
Mmm...

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:10.666
<i>Vuta Pumzi.</i> Sarabi.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:19.041
Alive. She's alive!

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:26.000
Why are you all looking at me?

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:28.332
You were thrown from the tree.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.666
He saved your life.

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:33.750
- Who?
- Taka.

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.332
-  Uh...
- Taka saved you.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.375
Isn't that right, brother?

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.415
You saved me?

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:46.750
Uh... Well, I...
I had to do something.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.082
Thank you.

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:50.707
We're lucky.

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:53.125
Those bees
almost killed us all.

01:09:53.291 --> 01:09:54.875
Those bees saved our lives.

01:09:55.041 --> 01:09:56.458
- Oh, Mufasa.
-  Really?

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.291
Because, uh, it felt like
an elephant stampede.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:00.540
We're alive, aren't we?

01:10:00.541 --> 01:10:01.708
The elephants
would have fought with us.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:02.916
We're lions.

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:04.333
Nobody will fight with us.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.666
Not out here.

Rafiki, who...

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.875
Who are the Outsiders?

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:45.166
Well, the Outsiders come
from many prides.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.957
But, when they are born,
they are hated

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.833
because they are different
from their tribe.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.375
Like you and your tribe?

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:54.125
Yes, just like me.

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:56.458
- But, Rafiki?
- Yes?

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.541
Why do they wanna
hurt everybody?

01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:02.666
Sometimes, when the people
most like you don't love you,

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:06.041
it is a hurt that can cause
the greatest pain.

01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:07.708
And this pain

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:11.250
can lead you
to hate everything.

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:14.000
I'm glad that didn't happen
to you, Rafiki.

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:16.708
Yes, my child. I'm glad too.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.333
Um, hi. We're here, too.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.250
Yeah, why are you leavin' us
outside this story

01:11:21.416 --> 01:11:24.040
when I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outsiders.

01:11:24.041 --> 01:11:25.124
- Come on!
-  Yeah,

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:26.250
we've always
been misunderstood.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.833
I contain multitudes.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:36.250
There are many ways to <i>Milele.</i>

01:11:37.125 --> 01:11:39.332
But this will be ours.

01:11:47.541 --> 01:11:50.166
<i>Go. Go, Mufasa.</i>

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:52.416
<i>Find your forever.</i>

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:55.375
<i>I got you.</i>

01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:57.708
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:02.541
Mmm.

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:08.208
<i>Iketle Rafiki.

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:10.875
Mmm...

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.083
Hey, Rafiki?

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:21.000
What are you doing?

01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:24.625
I am confirming
my vision, Mufasa.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:29.665
Can I ask you
something, Rafiki?

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:30.749
Hmm?

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.125
How many of your visions
have come true?

01:12:33.666 --> 01:12:36.166
- So far, none.
- None?

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:39.416
But it's not what I see.
It's what I feel.

01:12:39.708 --> 01:12:41.291
But how do you...

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.416
How do you know when
you should follow a feeling?

01:12:44.875 --> 01:12:46.750
<i>Milele</i> exists.

01:12:47.125 --> 01:12:49.583
I feel it in here.

01:12:49.916 --> 01:12:51.250
The question is,

01:12:51.416 --> 01:12:53.791
what do you feel, Mufasa,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.416
in there?

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.000
The weather's shifted.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:18.833
There's not enough fresh snow.

01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:21.415
Hey, if the Outsiders
find our tracks,

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:23.458
they'll follow them to <i>Milele.</i>

01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:26.165
Zazu, only you can
help us now.

01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:28.125
Oh. Are you quite sure
about that?

01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:29.333
No, I was actually thinking

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.083
that Rafiki looks pretty
handy, and with the stick...

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:32.625
Zazu, you can use your wings

01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:34.458
to cover our tracks
as we head up the mountain

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:36.000
without leaving a trace.

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:38.082
Hey, you can do this.

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.083
Oh, hmm. Yeah.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.375
Yes, sir. You're right.
I've got this.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:48.458
Okay. It's just me against
a frozen mountain.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.290
You know, one hornbill charged
with saving the future...

01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:53.208
Whoa! Mummy!

01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:57.375
Oh, man alive,
that's cold.

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.916
Now what's happening?

01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:15.125
We can't keep stopping.

01:14:15.291 --> 01:14:17.666
Somehow, they have
covered their tracks.

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:19.250
In the snow?

01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:21.041
It's not possible.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.375
Majesty, they could be
anywhere on this mountain...

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:24.583
Then find them!

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:25.791
Now.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.208
I have a report.

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:39.166
The Outsiders
are completely lost.

01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.416
Well played, Mufasa.

01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:41.750
Great job, Zazu.

01:14:41.916 --> 01:14:42.916
And as per usual.

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:44.333
I knew
you could do it.

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.750
We did it. We did it.

01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.291
No, you did it.

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:51.208
Great thinking, Mufasa.

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:52.707
Oh, we're all
rubbing off on each other.

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:53.916
Perfectly normal thing to do.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:55.791
Who wants to rub against Zazu?

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.500
No one. I'm leaving now.

01:14:57.666 --> 01:14:59.500
I'll scout ahead.

01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:09.750
Ah.

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:15.333
I got you, Rafiki.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.708
- Hey.
- I got you.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.125
<i>Ho monate,</i> Mufasa.

01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:19.500
Yeah, I got you.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:25.583
Mufasa...

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:28.416
"I got you."

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:45.291
Hidden in the shadows,
downwind, light of foot.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.958
Interesting hunting style,
Mufasa.

01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:49.624
We have to eat something

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:51.375
before we take on
that descent.

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:53.666
Unfortunately, there's
nothing to hunt up here.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:55.000
See under that rock?

01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:57.624
There's a civet
about to leave his den.

01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.415
Of course
you can smell

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:00.791
a civet hidden in the snow.

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:04.040
You, the lion
who can do anything.

01:16:04.041 --> 01:16:05.958
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:08.750
It means I see you, Mufasa.

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:10.833
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.333
Now, that part, I believe.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.625
Because, smart as you are,

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:17.583
you have a way of seeing
everything but yourself.

01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:19.125
What is this?

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.958
What is this, Sarabi?

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:22.790
There is a civet in the snow

01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:24.416
right where you said
it would be.

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:26.500
And you smelled the Outsiders
on the wind,

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:28.958
which means you're the one who
smelled the flowers on my fur.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:30.125
It was a lucky guess.

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:32.500
You can smell the exact flower
from my valley.

01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:34.541
No,
that's not possible.

01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:36.083
You saved me.

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:38.708
Held me, covered me in the
stampede, comforted me.

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:39.875
No, it was Taka.

01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:42.000
"I got you.
I got you, Sarabi."

01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:44.291
- I'm here to protect him.
- That was you.

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:46.457
I was lost in the water,
and he found me.

01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:47.541
My brother saved me.

01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:49.208
Ah, I sensed it
from the beginning.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.332
His blood is the blood
of the king.

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:52.415
Mufasa.

01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:54.333
- That is his destiny.
- No!

01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:56.708
His destiny was to save you.

01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:02.249

<i>Deceit is a tool

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:10.500
There wasn't much
to eat on this mountain

01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:12.166
until now.

01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:16.666
Tell me, how did you cover
your tracks in the snow?

01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:18.291
A bird helped us.

01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:21.208
Lions getting help
from a bird?

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:24.083
Just as I will help you.

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:25.833
You will help us?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.833
You think we need help
from a wounded coward?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.375
I may hold the blood
of a king,

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:38.416
but it was Mufasa
who killed your son.

01:22:38.916 --> 01:22:41.000
It was Mufasa

01:22:41.166 --> 01:22:43.083
who trapped you up here,

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.125
outsmarted you at every turn.

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:50.333
Now I will lead you to him
and to <i>Milele.</i>

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.541
<i>Milele!</i>

01:22:52.708 --> 01:22:57.291
<i>Milele</i> is nothing but a dream,
a vision sold to cubs.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.375
Ah. Well,
tell that to the monkey.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.125
He leads them to it.

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:03.708
Look at you.

01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:07.083
A pack of starving wolves

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:09.375
clinging to the side
of a mountain.

01:23:09.541 --> 01:23:11.166
No tracks to follow.

01:23:11.333 --> 01:23:15.875
Only one chance at revenge.

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:18.041
Me!

01:23:19.666 --> 01:23:20.833
Revenge...

01:23:22.916 --> 01:23:24.875
What about your father?

01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:27.500
Because of Mufasa,

01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:29.916
I have no father.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.791
He did this.

01:23:35.166 --> 01:23:36.291
Yes.

01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:38.083
You lost a father,

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.583
and I, a son.

01:23:41.125 --> 01:23:43.666
Taka, will you join us?

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:48.416
Together, we can both
have our revenge.

01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:52.958
It will be my pleasure...

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:56.375
King.

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:21.416
Taka!

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:24.083
Taka, where have you been?

01:24:25.291 --> 01:24:26.291
Hunting.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:28.166
I couldn't find anything,

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:30.458
but I was never
as good as you.

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.666
Or my mother.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:36.124
There's something I need
to tell you.

01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.208
No.

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:40.083
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.375
I need to thank you.

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:45.458
You kept your word
to Eshe and Obasi.

01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:47.708
- Taka...
- You saved me, Mufasa.

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:49.541
And I...

01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:54.875
will never forget
what you've done, my brother.

01:24:57.291 --> 01:25:00.290
Oh, guys!
I have found a way down

01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:02.125
just beyond those near peaks.

01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:05.000
Was it something I said?

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:16.833
Hey, Rafiki?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.708
Yes.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:21.375
We are nearing
destiny, Mufasa.

01:25:21.541 --> 01:25:24.250
And so, the earth must shake.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:46.374
Okay, now I am
100 million percent sure

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:47.457
who Taka is.

01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:48.541
Just be honest. Is it me?

01:25:48.666 --> 01:25:51.125
In case you missed it,
we're not featured in this.

01:25:51.291 --> 01:25:52.750
I think the civet has more
screen time.

01:25:52.916 --> 01:25:54.332
Hey, maybe they'll put us
in the play.

01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:55.875
No, no, please don't
mention the play again.

01:25:56.041 --> 01:25:57.624
I went to see it.
I'm nothing

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:58.750
but a giant sock puppet.

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:00.208
You went to see it?
You didn't bring me?

01:26:00.375 --> 01:26:03.250
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi
are in love?

01:26:03.416 --> 01:26:05.208
Love?

01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:06.665
That sounds gross
and not something like

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.541
I constantly
think about and really want.

01:26:08.708 --> 01:26:10.250
What is Taka gonna do to them?

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:13.666
Little one,
Taka's heart was broken.

01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:16.708
And now his trap was set.

01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.541
Mufasa. Do you see?

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.458
I don't believe it.

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.708
The other side
of the light.

01:26:39.375 --> 01:26:40.375
Home.

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:43.041
<i>Milele.</i>

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:34.541
I can't believe it.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:38.958
We found it. We found <i>Milele.</i>

01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:40.125
Yes.

01:27:40.916 --> 01:27:45.416
You found it, brother.
You always do.

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:26.291
Rafiki.

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:30.958
This is the tree
from your visions.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.375
I have seen this tree
many times,

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:38.833
and, in each vision,
there was always a brother

01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:40.958
standing right here.

01:28:41.125 --> 01:28:42.666
But there's
no one here, Rafiki,

01:28:42.833 --> 01:28:45.625
and you came here
to find your twin.

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:48.708
He was taken from me long ago.

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:51.875
What I saw in my dreams
was a brother.

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:54.083
Standing right here.

01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:56.958
A friend, family.

01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.833
What I saw was you.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.500
The unseeable.

01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:03.125
I saw Mufasa.

01:29:03.291 --> 01:29:04.291
Me?

01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:06.291
Yes, you.

01:29:06.458 --> 01:29:08.041
My brother.

01:29:14.125 --> 01:29:15.166
Mufasa.

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:16.750
How do you know who I am?

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:18.707
We know the Outsiders
are hunting you,

01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:20.708
and we fear
you'll bring danger.

01:29:20.875 --> 01:29:22.875
No. No. We covered our tracks.

01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.250
I promise you
<i>Milele</i> is a safe place,

01:29:25.416 --> 01:29:28.040
and I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:34.000
Do not run.

01:29:34.166 --> 01:29:36.208
You have nothing to fear.

01:29:36.375 --> 01:29:38.166
We are not here for you.

01:29:38.625 --> 01:29:41.708
We have come for Mufasa.

01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:44.166
Oh, no, no.
How did they get here?

01:29:45.166 --> 01:29:47.416
Do not let him divide us.

01:29:52.875 --> 01:29:56.000
It's no use, Mufasa.
The Circle...

01:29:57.708 --> 01:29:59.833
The Circle is broken.

01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:01.124
No!

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:02.666
Mufasa, what are you doing?

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:04.999
I'm going to fight,
and I'm going to show them

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.166
that they can fight, too.

01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:08.707
Rafiki, when you hear
my signal,

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:09.791
help me call them together.

01:30:09.916 --> 01:30:11.208
Yes, my brother.

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:15.041
There are
other lions here.

01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:16.333
Find them.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.583
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.666
Mufasa, you're not alone.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.291
It's my turn to go
ask questions first.

01:30:37.958 --> 01:30:41.541
This is where the hunt ends,
Mufasa.

01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:44.125
Thanks to your brother.

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:46.666
He left a trail of scars
for us to follow.

01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:48.875
He made a deal
to save himself.

01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:51.791
- Gave us this kingdom.
- Tell me he's lying.

01:30:51.958 --> 01:30:53.500
Asked us to kill the stray.

01:30:53.666 --> 01:30:54.833
Taka, please!

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.041
I'm the son of a king.

01:30:57.625 --> 01:30:59.625
But Sarabi chose you.

01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:01.166
Just like Mother.

01:31:01.333 --> 01:31:03.583
Just like my own father.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.958
I saved you
and you betrayed me!

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:08.583
What have you done?

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:10.416
I'm your brother,
fight with me!

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:13.208
You stole my destiny.

01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:15.000
Now this is yours.

01:31:16.791 --> 01:31:18.666
He's one of us now.

01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:21.000
My son's name...

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:23.291
was Shaju.

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:25.833
Shaju!

01:31:26.375 --> 01:31:28.416
All of this
should have been his.

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:33.083
And now I will rule it
without mercy.

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.833
This one is mine.

01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.875
Please. We can't wage
this battle alone.

01:32:31.041 --> 01:32:32.291
There's nothing we can do.

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:34.625
They've chased us
from our pride lands before.

01:32:34.791 --> 01:32:36.708
- They're too strong.
- Fight with us.

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:39.375
Fight for your young.
For your future.

01:32:39.541 --> 01:32:42.166
What future?
They've taken all we have.

01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:44.375
And they will always
take more.

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:12.125
I am Mufasa,
a stray with no pride,

01:33:12.291 --> 01:33:14.125
and yet I stand before you.

01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:15.333
Head unbowed.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.708
I know you're afraid,
but trust me.

01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:20.332
Nothing will change
if we remain isolated

01:33:20.333 --> 01:33:21.875
to our own tribes

01:33:22.041 --> 01:33:24.666
without concern
for the fate of others.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:26.625
But why should
we stand with you?

01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:28.541
This is your fight.

01:33:28.833 --> 01:33:31.625
Today, they are here for us
lions, but I assure you,

01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:34.708
as you let them walk among you
in search of us now,

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:37.583
they are plotting to come
for you tomorrow.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.791
One lion's hope cannot change
the fate of <i>Milele.</i>

01:33:40.958 --> 01:33:43.457
There is no lion as large
as an elephant,

01:33:43.458 --> 01:33:44.916
as strong as an oxen,

01:33:45.083 --> 01:33:47.541
fast as a cheetah
or tall as a giraffe,

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:50.125
who can soar and scout
as wide and far

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:52.208
as the cranes
and hawks in the sky.

01:33:52.416 --> 01:33:54.416
So, can't you see...

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:57.416
Every being has a place
in the Circle of Life.

01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:59.375
My breath is your breath.

01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:01.500
Your fight is my fight.

01:34:01.666 --> 01:34:05.041
I will not bend to evil,
and neither should you.

01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:07.541
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:11.208
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:11.375 --> 01:34:14.416
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:14.541 --> 01:34:16.208
Mufasa is right.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.041
<i>Milele</i> is home.

01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:22.332
We must stand with Mufasa!

01:34:22.333 --> 01:34:25.000
<i>Nants
ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:29.290
Together we shall stand strong
for <i>Milele!</i>

01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:32.165
<i>Nants
ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.790
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

01:34:36.666 --> 01:34:38.833
Here comes the lion!

01:34:47.375 --> 01:34:49.541
From this moment on,

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:54.333
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

01:34:54.583 --> 01:34:55.958
You'll have to take it.

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:22.875
Bye-bye.

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:32.499
You've messed
with the wrong hornbill!

01:35:34.833 --> 01:35:36.875
Lunch is served.

01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:40.708
Stand down! I am highly
trained and occasionally a...

01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:45.125
This is so embarrassing.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.500
I do have wings, you know.

01:36:07.083 --> 01:36:08.291
Taka!

01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:12.207
Taka, please. Please!

01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:18.583
Mufasa.

01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:20.958
Mufasa.

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:18.708
You dare

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:21.791
to challenge me?

01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:25.166
You took my son.

01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:27.791
<i>My future.</i>

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:32.291
<i>Taka... Taka, your
moment of courage will come.</i>

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.833
Blood for blood.

01:37:47.166 --> 01:37:49.416
Please. Don't kill him.

01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:51.250
I didn't kill him.

01:37:51.416 --> 01:37:52.750
You did.

01:38:21.916 --> 01:38:23.458
They're coming.

01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:28.166
The last lions.

01:38:28.333 --> 01:38:30.041
Time for their extinction,

01:38:30.208 --> 01:38:32.458
and we'll start
with the youngest.

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:45.083
The earth will shake.

01:38:48.708 --> 01:38:50.541
Attack!

01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:25.625
Mufasa.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:39:59.250
<i>Close your eyes</i>

01:39:59.416 --> 01:40:01.625
<i>and tell me what you hear.</i>

01:40:01.791 --> 01:40:03.791
<i>What you feel.</i>

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.041
Mufasa!

01:42:08.333 --> 01:42:10.333
He defeated the Outsiders.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.874
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

01:42:11.875 --> 01:42:13.207
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:19.625
Is that him?
Our king?

01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:27.375
Your Highness.

01:42:28.875 --> 01:42:29.874
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

01:42:29.875 --> 01:42:31.083
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

01:42:31.875 --> 01:42:33.166
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

01:42:38.875 --> 01:42:40.375
- My king.
- Your Highness.

01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:42.166
- Your Majesty.
- My king.

01:42:42.333 --> 01:42:43.500
Defeated Kiros!

01:42:46.916 --> 01:42:48.875
- My king.
- King?

01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:51.750
No, no, I'm not king.

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:53.041
Raise your heads.

01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:55.833
No. I'm just... No, no!
No more kings.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.333
We are all one. Please.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.625
Please. Raise your heads.

01:43:00.875 --> 01:43:02.833
But, Mufasa,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.958
you have
brought them together.

01:43:05.458 --> 01:43:07.457
You helped them see
in themselves

01:43:07.458 --> 01:43:09.500
what they considered
unseeable.

01:43:10.166 --> 01:43:12.625
Nothing is more kingly.

01:43:12.833 --> 01:43:14.875
No, Rafiki.

01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:18.125
I'm not king.
I'm not royal blood.

01:43:18.291 --> 01:43:20.083
Don't you see, my brother?

01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:23.000
It is not what you were,

01:43:23.208 --> 01:43:27.416
it is what you have become.

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:31.041
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.375
My brother,

01:43:39.833 --> 01:43:42.791
something beautiful
awaits you.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.458
Is this real?

01:43:59.916 --> 01:44:01.125
But it can't be.

01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:05.250
It can't be.

01:44:26.250 --> 01:44:28.625
Oh, Mufasa.

01:44:29.375 --> 01:44:31.041
But how can it be?

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.916
I had a son named Mufasa.

01:44:35.125 --> 01:44:37.916
Taken from me
by a great flood.

01:44:38.416 --> 01:44:39.416
Mother?

01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:43.250
I never stopped hoping.

01:44:43.416 --> 01:44:45.166
Believing.

01:44:45.333 --> 01:44:47.000
My son.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.541
I've dreamt of this moment.

01:44:54.291 --> 01:44:56.000
And now it's come true.

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.958
Oh, Mufasa.

01:45:03.083 --> 01:45:04.375
But Father?

01:45:06.375 --> 01:45:07.499
Where's Father?

01:45:14.083 --> 01:45:16.041
He lives in you now.

01:45:16.958 --> 01:45:19.916
He lives in you.

01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:28.916
I always dreamed
we'd be together again.

01:45:30.166 --> 01:45:34.125
And I knew it would be
in <i>Milele.</i>

01:45:36.166 --> 01:45:37.291
My son.

01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:39.666
Mufasa.

01:45:46.625 --> 01:45:49.750
Mufasa, please forgive me.

01:45:50.541 --> 01:45:53.333
You must banish him, Sire.

01:45:55.166 --> 01:45:57.041
As long as I am king,

01:45:57.208 --> 01:45:59.666
my brother will have
a place here.

01:46:01.416 --> 01:46:03.916
Brother, I am so...

01:46:04.083 --> 01:46:05.916
But I won't ever

01:46:06.541 --> 01:46:08.208
say your name again.

01:46:09.583 --> 01:46:10.833
I can't.

01:46:12.083 --> 01:46:13.291
I won't.

01:46:14.125 --> 01:46:15.958
Then call me Scar.

01:46:16.583 --> 01:46:19.833
So I will never forget
what I have done.

01:46:20.625 --> 01:46:21.916
Scar.

01:46:22.916 --> 01:46:24.625
Your Majesty.

01:46:34.125 --> 01:46:35.583
Welcome home.

01:46:42.875 --> 01:46:44.333
Your Majesty.

01:46:52.291 --> 01:46:53.875
So, Mufasa,

01:46:54.041 --> 01:46:56.790
I see your family
has been awaiting you

01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:59.208
in <i>Milele</i> after all.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.958
Yes, Rafiki.

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.583
Yes, they were.

01:47:11.583 --> 01:47:14.458
It is your time, Mufasa.

01:47:15.625 --> 01:47:18.041
Rafiki, I wish
I could see him.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.500
I wish I could meet
my grandfather.

01:47:20.666 --> 01:47:23.208
As Mufasa once told
your father,

01:47:23.375 --> 01:47:25.458
look into the heavens, Kiara.

01:47:25.625 --> 01:47:29.208
The great kings of the past
will always be there

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.249
waiting for you.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:13.833
Mmm...

01:49:19.125 --> 01:49:21.165
I don't want him
to go, Rafiki.

01:49:21.166 --> 01:49:22.708
I don't want it to end.

01:49:23.291 --> 01:49:25.208
Don't you see, Kiara?

01:49:25.583 --> 01:49:28.291
Mufasa lives in you.

01:49:29.166 --> 01:49:31.541
He lives in you.

01:49:33.791 --> 01:49:35.708
Dad!

01:49:37.083 --> 01:49:39.291
- Rafiki.
- It was unbelievable.

01:49:39.458 --> 01:49:41.333
- It was perfect.
- You could not improve on it.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.041
That said, I do have notes.

01:49:43.208 --> 01:49:45.666
Some suggestions. Take 'em
or leave 'em. But take 'em.

01:49:47.208 --> 01:49:48.915
-  Dad!
-  Kiara!

01:49:51.083 --> 01:49:53.208
Kiara.

01:49:53.375 --> 01:49:54.375
Dad.

01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:56.208
Where's Mom?

01:49:56.375 --> 01:49:59.000
Well, love, there's
something you need to know.

01:49:59.166 --> 01:50:01.375
What? Did something
happen to Mom?

01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:03.833
Baby, I'm right here,
and I'm fine.

01:50:04.041 --> 01:50:05.625
Where were you?

01:50:05.791 --> 01:50:06.791
Kiara,

01:50:06.958 --> 01:50:08.958
this is your new brother.

01:50:09.125 --> 01:50:10.208
Brother?

01:50:10.375 --> 01:50:11.625
I have a brother?

01:50:12.583 --> 01:50:16.000
Hi there. I'm Kiara.
I will take care of you.

01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:18.250
Forever.

01:50:19.041 --> 01:50:20.333
Little one,

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.250
let me tell you a story.

01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:25.500
A story of a great king.
