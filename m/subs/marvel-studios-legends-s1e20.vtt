00:31.698 --> 00:32.949
You're a Valkyrie.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.040
I thought the Valkyrie
had all died gruesome deaths.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.542
Choose your next words wisely.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.672
Are you a fighter or are you food?

00:47.797 --> 00:49.049
I'm just passing through.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
It is food.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.218
(GROANS)

00:59.642 --> 01:00.685
He's mine.

01:00.935 --> 01:01.936
More food.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.322
Thank you.

01:13.823 --> 01:14.866
(GROANS)

01:17.577 --> 01:21.998
Whenever we get to talkin' about
Scrapper 142, what do I always say?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.417
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

01:24.501 --> 01:25.543
Trash.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.589
Were you waiting to just call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."

01:29.881 --> 01:30.965
Booze hag.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
That's the one that put me in here.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.179
Scrapper 142. Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.347
Asgardian?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.184
THOR: <i>The Valkyrie are legend.</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:43.978
<i>Elite warriors of Asgard,</i>
<i>sworn to defend the throne.</i>

01:44.646 --> 01:47.482
I'll listen to you till this is empty.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.818
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.278
We need to get back there.
I need your help. Wow.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.616
I'm not getting dragged into
another of Odin's family squabbles.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.618
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your sister.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.996
<i>Look, I already faced her once</i>
<i>back when I believed in the throne,</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:03.665
<i>and it cost me everything.</i>

02:03.748 --> 02:07.043
THOR: <i>But this isn't about the crown.</i>
<i>This is about the people.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:09.671
<i>And they're dying.</i>
<i>And they're your people, too.</i>

02:10.338 --> 02:11.673
If I'm gonna die,

02:11.756 --> 02:15.343
it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.428
Here we go.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.182
Don't die.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.193
Go! Go, now!

02:33.736 --> 02:34.779
HELA: No!

02:35.572 --> 02:36.614
No.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.665
THOR: We're fulfilling the prophecy.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.584
I hate this prophecy.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.252
So do I, but we have no choice.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.218
Your throne.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.639
Where to?

03:04.934 --> 03:06.102
THANOS: <i>Dread it,</i>

03:06.603 --> 03:07.979
<i>run from it,</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:10.899
<i>destiny arrives all the same.</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:13.943
And now, it's here.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.446
Or should I say,

03:17.864 --> 03:19.949
-I am...
-No!

03:20.950 --> 03:23.077
ROCKET: <i>Kind of a step down</i>
<i>from the golden palaces</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:25.288
<i>and the magic hammers and whatnot.</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:26.998
Have a little compassion, pal.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.083
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.877
They're probably
happy to have a home.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.545
You shouldn't have come.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.505
Ah!

03:34.672 --> 03:35.673
Valkyrie!

03:36.382 --> 03:37.467
We need your help.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.970
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Avengers,

03:43.181 --> 03:44.307
assemble!

03:44.682 --> 03:46.100
(ALL YELLING)

03:56.569 --> 03:58.404
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

03:58.988 --> 04:01.908
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

04:10.625 --> 04:12.043
When can we expect you back?

04:14.003 --> 04:16.005
Um, about that...

04:16.506 --> 04:18.633
Thor, your people need a king.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.426
No, they already have one.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.886
(LAUGHS)

04:23.137 --> 04:24.347
That's funny.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.895
Are you being serious?

04:31.229 --> 04:32.563
You're a leader.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.399
That's who you are.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.529
You know, I'd make a lot of changes
around here.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.282
I'm counting on it, Your Majesty.
