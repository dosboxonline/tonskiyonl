WEBVTT

00:47.001 --> 00:48.001
Do it!

00:51.321 --> 00:52.521
You got him! You got him!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.921
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

01:10.081 --> 01:11.721
I can't stop that.

01:12.041 --> 01:13.681
Get out of here, you useless tit.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.801
<i>When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.</i>

01:16.961 --> 01:18.201
Can you stop it?

01:18.401 --> 01:21.721
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

01:21.921 --> 01:23.481
No.

01:31.121 --> 01:32.881
Let me have a look at him.

01:33.241 --> 01:34.721
He's fine. He's fine.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.241
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.001
I'll give you one more round.

01:40.721 --> 01:44.081
- Seconds out. Let's go.
- What do we do? Tell me what to do.

01:45.001 --> 01:46.241
You let him hit you.

01:49.921 --> 01:51.801
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

01:53.121 --> 01:55.841
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

01:56.601 --> 01:58.601
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

01:58.801 --> 02:01.521
<i>or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.</i>

02:02.521 --> 02:04.081
- Come on!
- Break. Break.

02:04.241 --> 02:06.921
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

02:07.081 --> 02:09.360
<i>down in the different layers of meat...</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:11.441
<i>and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

02:21.361 --> 02:23.241
- That's it! Come on!
- What are you doing?

02:28.601 --> 02:29.601
Knock him out, Willie!

02:33.081 --> 02:34.641
Get on him!

02:38.361 --> 02:40.081
<i>People love violence.</i>

02:41.001 --> 02:43.641
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

02:43.801 --> 02:46.081
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

02:46.241 --> 02:48.601
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

02:49.121 --> 02:51.281
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

02:51.801 --> 02:53.281
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:56.761
<i>and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

03:00.721 --> 03:02.161
I'll warm up the car.

03:02.321 --> 03:03.721
Mr. Dunn?

03:04.601 --> 03:05.921
I owe you money?

03:06.081 --> 03:07.321
No, sir.

03:07.481 --> 03:09.001
I know your mama?

03:09.241 --> 03:11.321
Don't rightly know, sir.

03:11.481 --> 03:13.961
- Then what is it you want?
- I was on the undercard.

03:14.121 --> 03:16.721
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

03:16.881 --> 03:19.441
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

03:19.961 --> 03:22.001
- Did you happen to see it?
- Nope.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.601
I did pretty good.

03:23.761 --> 03:26.241
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

03:26.441 --> 03:28.161
I don't train girls.

03:28.361 --> 03:31.801
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

03:32.481 --> 03:35.841
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

03:48.881 --> 03:50.881
It's a mistake.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.201
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

03:58.801 --> 04:00.881
Just push, will you?

04:01.641 --> 04:04.681
- What did Hogan want?
- Offered us a title shot.

04:05.401 --> 04:06.721
About time.

04:06.881 --> 04:08.841
I turned him down flat.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.441
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

04:16.401 --> 04:19.880
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

04:20.281 --> 04:22.481
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

04:22.641 --> 04:24.641
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

04:25.321 --> 04:28.641
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

04:29.401 --> 04:31.481
Whatever you say, Frankie.

04:32.921 --> 04:36.481
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

04:36.841 --> 04:39.761
<i>that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

04:41.401 --> 04:43.001
<i>Sometimes...</i>

04:43.201 --> 04:46.921
<i>best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

04:55.641 --> 04:58.361
Well, do your best, Lord...

04:58.881 --> 05:00.721
protect Katy.

05:01.481 --> 05:03.401
Annie too.

05:04.281 --> 05:05.841
Other than that...

05:06.281 --> 05:10.001
you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

05:10.441 --> 05:15.041
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

05:31.121 --> 05:33.641
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.441
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

05:37.601 --> 05:39.041
What's confusing you this week?

05:39.241 --> 05:41.681
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.121
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

05:45.281 --> 05:49.761
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

05:50.481 --> 05:54.161
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

05:54.841 --> 05:57.081
The only reason you come to Mass
every day is to wind me up.

05:57.241 --> 05:59.321
- It won't happen this morning.
- I'm confused.

05:59.481 --> 06:00.801
- No, you aren't.
- Yes, I am.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.161
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

06:04.321 --> 06:05.801
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

06:05.961 --> 06:08.801
- What about the Holy Ghost?
- He's an expression of God's love.

06:08.961 --> 06:11.561
- And Jesus?
- Son of God. Don't play stupid.

06:11.761 --> 06:14.081
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

06:14.241 --> 06:16.641
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

06:23.001 --> 06:24.961
- Did you write your daughter?
- Absolutely.

06:25.161 --> 06:26.681
Now you're lying to a priest.

06:26.921 --> 06:30.441
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

06:40.601 --> 06:45.001
<i>Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

06:45.641 --> 06:49.001
<i>"Frankie would say," Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...</i>

06:49.161 --> 06:52.321
<i>and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating."</i>

07:00.401 --> 07:04.121
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

07:05.481 --> 07:09.001
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

07:09.161 --> 07:11.041
out of Broward County, Texas!

07:13.481 --> 07:16.561
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

07:17.961 --> 07:22.441
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

07:23.081 --> 07:26.641
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

07:28.721 --> 07:32.681
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

07:34.881 --> 07:39.601
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

07:41.601 --> 07:43.001
Well, that's nice to hear.

07:43.801 --> 07:47.761
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

07:47.921 --> 07:51.561
but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

07:51.721 --> 07:53.401
niggers or not.

07:53.601 --> 07:56.201
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

07:56.401 --> 07:58.641
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

07:58.841 --> 08:01.001
<i>but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

08:01.161 --> 08:05.201
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

08:07.201 --> 08:10.361
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

08:10.561 --> 08:12.241
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

08:12.401 --> 08:16.521
to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

08:16.681 --> 08:19.321
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.321
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

08:22.481 --> 08:24.801
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

08:25.281 --> 08:26.921
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

08:27.121 --> 08:29.121
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

08:29.921 --> 08:32.160
- Shawrelle.
- I will.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.520
Leave him alone.

08:35.481 --> 08:38.001
Danger, you go on back to training.

08:39.121 --> 08:40.881
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

08:43.001 --> 08:44.001
Ow!

08:44.160 --> 08:46.441
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

08:47.441 --> 08:49.681
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

08:49.921 --> 08:52.161
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

08:52.321 --> 08:54.001
Give his mama back her tights.

08:54.161 --> 08:57.961
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

08:58.321 --> 09:01.161
<i>but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

09:01.601 --> 09:05.561
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

09:05.721 --> 09:09.001
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

09:09.521 --> 09:11.761
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

09:12.521 --> 09:16.361
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

09:16.521 --> 09:19.601
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

09:19.761 --> 09:21.361
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.401
Well, he's hurting me.

09:23.561 --> 09:27.761
Breaking my heart, watching him punch the
air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

09:28.481 --> 09:31.401
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

09:31.601 --> 09:35.201
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

09:35.361 --> 09:37.161
It smells better, Frankie.

09:37.561 --> 09:39.881
Bleach smells like bleach.

09:49.201 --> 09:52.121
- Hey, Scrap.
- Hey, Mr. Willie.

09:54.401 --> 09:56.401
Hey, nice fight last night.

10:01.121 --> 10:02.521
Nice fight.

10:05.921 --> 10:07.521
- Big Willie.
- Hey, Sally.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.281
- Nice fight.
- Thanks, man.

10:12.441 --> 10:14.121
People are talking.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.801
What the hell kind of language is that?

10:33.361 --> 10:34.761
What do you want?

10:35.241 --> 10:38.241
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

10:38.401 --> 10:40.121
not talking to another manager.

10:41.761 --> 10:43.641
Not talking to another manager?

10:43.841 --> 10:45.441
And not just any manager.

10:47.121 --> 10:48.241
Mickey Mack.

10:49.641 --> 10:54.361
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

10:54.641 --> 10:56.961
Not a word. Neither one of them.

10:58.281 --> 11:00.201
I'm trying to read here.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.641
Well, if you think that's more important.

11:05.001 --> 11:06.481
Who's your new girl?

11:07.961 --> 11:09.401
What?

11:20.441 --> 11:22.001
Jesus Christ.

11:22.161 --> 11:23.481
Better hurry up.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.481
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.681
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

11:37.841 --> 11:39.441
Thought you might change your mind.

11:40.081 --> 11:43.681
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

11:43.841 --> 11:46.361
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

11:46.521 --> 11:50.121
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

11:50.321 --> 11:53.001
- Willie, you ready to work?
- Anytime.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.121
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

11:56.961 --> 11:58.441
No.

11:58.601 --> 12:00.521
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.841
<i>She came from southwestern Missouri...</i>

12:05.041 --> 12:09.041
<i>the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

12:09.441 --> 12:14.241
<i>set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

12:14.441 --> 12:18.521
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.</i>

12:32.641 --> 12:33.841
It's for my dog.

12:34.081 --> 12:39.561
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

12:58.041 --> 12:59.321
Working the bag, boss.

12:59.481 --> 13:03.681
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

13:17.641 --> 13:19.641
Give her her money back.

13:20.721 --> 13:22.281
You sure?

13:22.921 --> 13:25.441
- How much did she pay?
- Six months.

13:26.801 --> 13:28.961
- Jesus Christ.
- No, I'll give it back.

13:29.121 --> 13:31.561
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

13:31.721 --> 13:34.361
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

13:34.521 --> 13:36.801
just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

13:36.961 --> 13:39.561
- But just don't encourage her, understand?
- Okay.

13:40.041 --> 13:43.561
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

13:48.521 --> 13:50.281
Looks like a bottle of water.

13:51.241 --> 13:52.761
He paid his dues?

13:53.481 --> 13:57.481
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

13:58.041 --> 14:00.521
Get out of my office.

14:10.281 --> 14:11.481
Fuck me.

14:57.361 --> 14:59.201
Can't think of it as a bag.

15:04.161 --> 15:06.881
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.161
Appreciate any help I can get.

15:11.721 --> 15:14.641
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

15:14.801 --> 15:16.081
And he's constantly moving.

15:16.241 --> 15:20.721
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

15:20.881 --> 15:25.441
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

15:25.601 --> 15:28.921
he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

15:29.121 --> 15:30.641
So you watch him real carefully.

15:30.801 --> 15:33.121
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

15:33.281 --> 15:37.041
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

15:37.201 --> 15:41.961
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

15:42.681 --> 15:45.321
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

15:46.401 --> 15:49.401
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

15:49.601 --> 15:51.241
- Good, good, good.
- Like that?

15:51.401 --> 15:53.841
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.441
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

15:59.441 --> 16:01.441
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

16:01.801 --> 16:05.401
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.361
You do have a speed bag.

16:21.441 --> 16:24.001
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

16:24.161 --> 16:25.801
All right, you go on home now.

16:25.961 --> 16:28.801
- I'll walk out with you?
- No, I am home.

16:28.961 --> 16:31.161
- Wanna see?
- Yeah.

16:40.121 --> 16:41.481
It's nice.

16:44.321 --> 16:46.481
Would it bother you much
if I worked a little longer?

16:47.521 --> 16:51.041
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

16:53.561 --> 16:55.041
Thank you.

17:10.881 --> 17:12.921
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

17:13.521 --> 17:16.721
<i>it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

17:17.201 --> 17:22.161
<i>beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

17:33.041 --> 17:38.161
<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

17:47.361 --> 17:49.881
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

17:50.241 --> 17:51.881
Hey, that's it. That's it.

17:52.721 --> 17:53.961
Hands up.

17:55.201 --> 17:56.961
Jab, jab, jab.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.401
Hey, Flip.

18:13.241 --> 18:14.721
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

18:14.881 --> 18:17.481
I think I found somebody you can beat.

18:20.441 --> 18:22.721
I don't fights women.

18:23.441 --> 18:26.241
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

18:26.401 --> 18:29.041
Because she...
Like, you, you could fight to him...

18:29.201 --> 18:30.881
and then you could kiss to him.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.721
Then you fight to him one more time.

18:33.081 --> 18:35.601
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

18:35.921 --> 18:38.201
- It's like poetry.
- You been reading and shit.

18:38.361 --> 18:40.921
- Thanks, bro.
- That's a girl, man?

18:41.161 --> 18:45.561
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

18:45.721 --> 18:48.401
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.201
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

18:50.361 --> 18:53.281
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

18:57.921 --> 19:02.201
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

19:11.241 --> 19:14.081
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

19:15.441 --> 19:19.521
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

19:19.681 --> 19:22.681
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

19:23.401 --> 19:25.561
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

19:26.801 --> 19:28.121
Some titties right there, man.

19:29.881 --> 19:33.201
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

19:33.361 --> 19:34.881
Punk.

19:36.161 --> 19:38.961
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

19:41.961 --> 19:44.481
- I'll give you a rubdown.
- Oh, I can't, Frankie.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.681
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

19:47.921 --> 19:51.001
- Something wrong with Gracie's car?
- She hates that car.

19:51.161 --> 19:54.481
Wants the old one back, but the
dealer said he's already got a buyer.

19:54.681 --> 19:56.321
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

19:57.561 --> 19:59.161
I'd appreciate that.

19:59.321 --> 20:00.681
Okay.

20:00.841 --> 20:03.641
- Thanks.
- See you later.

20:11.881 --> 20:14.841
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

20:16.001 --> 20:17.801
You ever do any work around here?

20:18.641 --> 20:21.281
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.601
Little girl seems to be coming along.

20:28.041 --> 20:31.761
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

20:32.961 --> 20:36.721
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

20:38.881 --> 20:42.001
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

20:43.281 --> 20:44.921
I wonder how the hell she got that.

20:45.081 --> 20:46.641
I wonder.

20:56.641 --> 20:58.641
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

20:58.801 --> 21:01.361
- This bag?
- Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

21:01.521 --> 21:04.361
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

21:04.521 --> 21:06.081
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

21:06.241 --> 21:08.241
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:08.401 --> 21:11.561
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

21:11.721 --> 21:15.081
- I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
- Yeah.

21:15.601 --> 21:18.881
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.401
I understand.

21:21.641 --> 21:22.681
Yeah.

21:25.681 --> 21:27.441
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

21:28.001 --> 21:30.601
- Can I give you some advice?
- I'd appreciate that.

21:31.121 --> 21:33.681
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

21:33.841 --> 21:35.921
that's gonna wanna train a girl.

21:36.081 --> 21:38.281
It's the latest freak show out there.

21:38.441 --> 21:40.841
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

21:41.001 --> 21:42.681
because you're too old.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.361
I don't feel that old.

21:45.521 --> 21:49.081
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

21:49.881 --> 21:52.721
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

21:53.801 --> 21:55.001
How old are you?

21:55.801 --> 21:59.041
- Thirty-one until my next birthday.
- Oh, well, there you go.

21:59.201 --> 22:00.761
Thirty-one.

22:01.401 --> 22:04.641
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

22:04.801 --> 22:06.721
Already been working it
for three years.

22:07.081 --> 22:10.601
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

22:10.921 --> 22:12.601
Never had any, boss.

22:13.721 --> 22:16.001
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

22:16.161 --> 22:18.321
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

22:18.721 --> 22:21.481
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

22:21.721 --> 22:23.241
Yeah.

22:24.001 --> 22:27.521
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

22:31.001 --> 22:33.441
- You're not gonna cry now, are you?
- No, sir.

22:34.481 --> 22:35.561
Yeah.

22:37.761 --> 22:39.241
Here.

22:40.841 --> 22:42.841
- Keep the goddamn thing.
- No, you need it.

22:43.001 --> 22:44.801
No, take the bag.

22:45.681 --> 22:48.121
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

22:48.281 --> 22:52.681
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

22:52.841 --> 22:55.521
- I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
- Yeah.

22:56.361 --> 22:58.081
Just don't lose it.

23:06.681 --> 23:08.241
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

23:08.401 --> 23:11.201
your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

23:11.361 --> 23:13.121
but if I don't see 40 percent...

23:14.921 --> 23:18.801
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.601
- Hey, Willie.
- Hey, Frankie.

23:30.761 --> 23:32.361
Something wrong?

23:32.561 --> 23:36.401
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

23:36.561 --> 23:39.921
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

23:40.121 --> 23:42.961
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

23:43.161 --> 23:44.961
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

23:45.161 --> 23:49.361
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

23:49.521 --> 23:51.361
Gracie cried when she saw it.

23:51.561 --> 23:53.241
Really?

23:54.161 --> 23:56.321
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

23:56.481 --> 24:00.521
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.521
Everything but the split.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.561
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

24:06.841 --> 24:08.081
What?

24:11.601 --> 24:14.761
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

24:14.921 --> 24:19.161
It ain't that, it's...
It's like you said, I got one shot.

24:19.761 --> 24:22.281
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

24:23.041 --> 24:26.241
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

24:27.201 --> 24:30.041
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

24:30.201 --> 24:33.601
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

24:34.201 --> 24:37.641
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

24:37.841 --> 24:39.081
Only way he'd do it.

24:40.001 --> 24:43.801
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

24:43.961 --> 24:45.441
I wish it could've been with me.

24:47.281 --> 24:51.281
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.281
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

25:02.881 --> 25:05.801
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

25:16.801 --> 25:21.441
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

25:21.601 --> 25:25.921
to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

25:26.081 --> 25:28.801
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

25:30.081 --> 25:32.961
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

25:33.721 --> 25:37.681
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.521
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

25:46.841 --> 25:50.921
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

25:55.921 --> 26:02.201
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

26:09.441 --> 26:11.521
I heard about Willie.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.881
That's cold. That's dead cold.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.041
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.121
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.801
Mm-hmm. Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

26:25.201 --> 26:27.041
Well, I've got the gym.

26:27.241 --> 26:29.641
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

26:29.801 --> 26:31.201
Uh-huh.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.281
Willie tell you why?

26:33.441 --> 26:36.361
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

26:36.521 --> 26:39.841
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.721
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

26:42.921 --> 26:44.881
How's that for not believing in him?

26:45.041 --> 26:48.401
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

26:48.561 --> 26:50.721
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

26:50.881 --> 26:54.121
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

26:54.281 --> 26:57.201
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

26:57.361 --> 26:58.721
Not protect him?

26:58.881 --> 27:01.241
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

27:01.441 --> 27:04.921
- Yeah.
- Well, now it makes sense.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.681
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

27:08.841 --> 27:11.081
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

27:11.681 --> 27:14.561
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

27:14.721 --> 27:18.201
banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

27:18.681 --> 27:20.481
I had my shot.

27:20.641 --> 27:23.281
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

27:23.441 --> 27:24.641
Yeah, well, I remember.

27:24.841 --> 27:28.601
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

27:28.801 --> 27:31.961
- cleaning up other people's spit.
- Yeah, right.

27:32.761 --> 27:36.281
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

27:37.241 --> 27:38.441
It's Gaelic.

27:38.641 --> 27:41.801
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.761
How do you say that in Gaelic?

28:51.481 --> 28:54.281
Oops. Sorry.

29:01.401 --> 29:02.881
Thanks.

29:03.201 --> 29:07.281
<i>The action continues as the
champ is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

29:07.481 --> 29:09.481
<i>and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

29:09.641 --> 29:12.321
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....</i>

29:13.041 --> 29:15.961
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

29:16.641 --> 29:19.481
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

29:21.521 --> 29:23.401
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

29:23.561 --> 29:26.921
<i>you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

29:28.081 --> 29:31.561
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

29:31.721 --> 29:35.721
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

29:35.881 --> 29:37.321
<i>you step into it.</i>

29:38.681 --> 29:40.361
<i>But Big Willie comes back.</i>

29:40.521 --> 29:42.841
<i>Oh, my God, he hits the champ
with a right hand.</i>

29:43.001 --> 29:45.401
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

29:45.601 --> 29:47.921
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

29:48.081 --> 29:51.441
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

29:51.601 --> 29:55.281
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

29:55.441 --> 29:58.361
<i>but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

30:00.281 --> 30:03.441
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

30:18.681 --> 30:20.361
Want a cheeseburger?

30:20.521 --> 30:22.321
- You bought me a cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

30:22.481 --> 30:24.561
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

30:24.721 --> 30:27.761
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

30:27.921 --> 30:31.001
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

30:32.281 --> 30:36.121
- You watch the fight?
- Yeah, I watched it.

30:36.481 --> 30:38.601
Willie did good.

30:39.681 --> 30:41.321
That's what you've got to say?

30:41.481 --> 30:44.121
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

30:45.121 --> 30:49.481
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.401
You watch it?

30:51.641 --> 30:53.761
Yeah, I got HBO.

30:54.721 --> 30:57.081
Now, how can you afford HBO?

30:57.241 --> 31:01.081
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

31:01.241 --> 31:03.801
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

31:03.961 --> 31:06.121
at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

31:07.001 --> 31:09.001
- That true?
- Yeah.

31:09.161 --> 31:12.841
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.361
Don't you remember nothing?

31:14.521 --> 31:18.961
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

31:19.121 --> 31:23.001
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

31:23.201 --> 31:26.681
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.361
I had to walk back two miles.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.681
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

31:36.041 --> 31:38.041
What the hell's that?

31:38.361 --> 31:40.521
It's her birthday.

32:02.401 --> 32:05.881
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

32:06.761 --> 32:08.881
So it's your birthday, huh?

32:09.081 --> 32:11.321
How old does that make you?

32:11.761 --> 32:14.361
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

32:14.561 --> 32:18.121
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

32:18.281 --> 32:20.241
which is what I been doing since 13.

32:20.441 --> 32:25.441
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

32:25.641 --> 32:28.361
which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

32:28.561 --> 32:30.761
I now realize may be God's simple truth.

32:30.921 --> 32:33.041
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

32:33.201 --> 32:36.801
my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

32:36.961 --> 32:39.561
my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

32:40.281 --> 32:43.001
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

32:43.201 --> 32:47.601
find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

32:48.041 --> 32:51.561
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.721
If I'm too old for this,
then I got nothing.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.401
That enough truth to suit you?

32:59.561 --> 33:00.881
This your speed bag?

33:01.041 --> 33:04.041
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

33:06.361 --> 33:09.521
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.841
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

33:13.001 --> 33:14.641
No, sorry.

33:14.801 --> 33:17.281
- You're in a position to negotiate?
- Yes, sir.

33:17.481 --> 33:21.481
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.721
I seen you looking at me.

33:24.881 --> 33:27.801
- Yeah, out of pity.
- Don't you say that.

33:27.961 --> 33:30.841
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

33:31.481 --> 33:32.761
I want a trainer.

33:33.481 --> 33:36.801
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

33:41.121 --> 33:44.321
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

33:46.681 --> 33:48.801
Stop, stop, stop.

33:48.961 --> 33:53.001
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

33:56.681 --> 33:58.321
Okay.

33:58.681 --> 34:00.081
If I'm gonna take you on...

34:00.241 --> 34:03.761
- You won't never regret it.
- Look, just listen to me.

34:03.921 --> 34:06.761
- If I take you on...
- I promise I'll work so hard.

34:06.921 --> 34:09.360
God, this is a mistake already.

34:09.521 --> 34:11.161
Mm-mm.

34:11.321 --> 34:12.920
I'm listening, boss.

34:13.841 --> 34:18.360
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

34:18.801 --> 34:22.521
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

34:22.960 --> 34:25.841
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

34:26.001 --> 34:27.201
That's all I ask.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.880
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

34:30.641 --> 34:32.681
- Alrighty.
- We got a deal.

34:33.081 --> 34:35.001
No, not quite.

34:35.161 --> 34:37.121
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

34:37.281 --> 34:40.001
then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.761
- I hate to argue with you, but...
- Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

34:43.920 --> 34:47.721
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.801
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.201
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.880
It's the only way I'll do it.

35:04.161 --> 35:05.321
All right.

35:06.441 --> 35:11.401
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

35:11.561 --> 35:14.921
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

35:15.081 --> 35:17.241
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

35:17.401 --> 35:20.241
So here's what you do.

35:20.481 --> 35:22.881
You get yourself...
Bend your knees a little bit.

35:23.401 --> 35:26.921
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

35:29.281 --> 35:32.201
- Move them how, boss?
- Just... Go... Hit the bag.

35:34.041 --> 35:35.841
- Stop.
- What'd I do wrong?

35:36.001 --> 35:38.201
Okay, you did two things wrong.

35:38.361 --> 35:41.681
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

35:42.201 --> 35:46.041
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

35:46.201 --> 35:50.121
it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.961
You can count with me if you want.

35:52.121 --> 35:54.961
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

35:55.121 --> 35:57.121
- Can you show me that again?
- I just...

35:57.281 --> 35:59.281
Just say "one," please.

35:59.441 --> 36:00.961
- One.
- Okay.

36:01.121 --> 36:02.961
- One. Okay.
- One.

36:03.121 --> 36:06.281
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

36:06.481 --> 36:11.121
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

36:11.561 --> 36:16.481
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

36:16.641 --> 36:22.041
Then I come over, and I shift to my left
foot, and I hit it with my right hand.

36:22.201 --> 36:24.761
And ice pick maneuver again.

36:24.961 --> 36:28.001
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

36:29.561 --> 36:32.321
Don't watch anything but my feet.

36:43.761 --> 36:47.241
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

37:17.361 --> 37:21.201
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

37:29.601 --> 37:33.281
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

37:33.441 --> 37:34.921
Rest when you're dead.

37:35.081 --> 37:36.761
Come here.

37:41.281 --> 37:43.921
<i>You canâ€™t just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

37:44.121 --> 37:47.201
<i>you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

37:51.201 --> 37:53.521
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

37:53.681 --> 37:57.761
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

37:57.921 --> 37:59.161
Move your feet.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.321
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

38:16.081 --> 38:19.601
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

38:19.761 --> 38:23.481
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

38:27.841 --> 38:30.601
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

38:32.281 --> 38:35.121
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

38:41.361 --> 38:45.641
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

38:46.201 --> 38:48.481
<i>Then you gotta show them
all over again.</i>

38:48.641 --> 38:50.801
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

38:50.961 --> 38:53.961
<i>till they think they were born that way.</i>

38:55.721 --> 38:56.961
Shift.

38:57.121 --> 38:59.041
Shift away.

39:00.081 --> 39:03.281
Okay. That's enough for today.

39:03.441 --> 39:06.841
Good work. Good girl.

39:08.161 --> 39:10.801
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

39:33.321 --> 39:36.801
Hey. Hey, come here.

39:39.601 --> 39:40.841
You're not breathing.

39:42.481 --> 39:44.201
Hate to disagree with you.

39:44.801 --> 39:47.641
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

39:47.801 --> 39:51.241
- Now, stop doing that.
- Okay.

39:51.401 --> 39:53.681
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

39:54.241 --> 39:57.801
- I mean, for a girl.
- I don't train girls.

40:00.561 --> 40:02.761
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

40:02.921 --> 40:06.441
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

40:06.641 --> 40:09.681
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

40:16.521 --> 40:19.321
- Got any family, boss?
- What?

40:21.881 --> 40:25.241
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

40:26.241 --> 40:27.481
No.

40:29.201 --> 40:31.521
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

40:32.321 --> 40:33.561
That's family.

40:34.321 --> 40:36.401
We're not exactly close.

40:36.881 --> 40:38.321
How much she weigh?

40:39.561 --> 40:40.921
What?

40:41.081 --> 40:44.241
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

40:46.561 --> 40:48.241
Yeah.

40:48.481 --> 40:50.601
Not very big.

40:50.881 --> 40:54.881
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

41:00.921 --> 41:04.441
So, what do you think?

41:04.601 --> 41:06.521
I ready for a fight?

41:12.281 --> 41:14.121
Hey, Sally.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.241
Come here for a minute, will you?

41:19.121 --> 41:21.961
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

41:22.561 --> 41:25.961
- Can I see you a minute?
- Sally here's a real good manager.

41:26.121 --> 41:30.081
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

41:30.241 --> 41:32.201
I'm looking for a good one.

41:32.641 --> 41:35.561
Well, see, there you go.

41:38.281 --> 41:40.081
Nice working with you, girlie.

41:44.041 --> 41:46.321
- What'd you want?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

41:46.481 --> 41:50.641
I ain't lying, I've been watching
you work. You got a hell of a left.

41:51.001 --> 41:52.401
Thank you.

41:54.321 --> 41:58.001
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

42:00.161 --> 42:03.321
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

42:03.481 --> 42:06.001
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

42:18.201 --> 42:19.721
Break.

42:21.001 --> 42:24.081
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

42:24.281 --> 42:26.961
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

42:27.121 --> 42:30.441
- I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
- You're wearing her down.

42:32.121 --> 42:33.921
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

42:35.441 --> 42:37.521
- Come on.
- Do it.

42:38.201 --> 42:40.241
Come on, let's do this!

42:44.361 --> 42:45.681
That's it!

42:53.321 --> 42:54.721
Nice night, eh?

42:55.121 --> 42:57.841
Jesus Christ.

42:58.001 --> 42:59.881
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

43:00.201 --> 43:01.841
Hell of a fighter.

43:02.001 --> 43:04.041
11-0.

43:04.201 --> 43:06.201
Your left. Keep your left up.

43:10.961 --> 43:13.041
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

43:13.241 --> 43:16.401
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

43:16.561 --> 43:18.081
Yeah.

43:18.401 --> 43:20.241
Your left, damn it.

43:21.161 --> 43:25.841
Wouldn't have been my choice for her
first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

43:26.001 --> 43:28.761
- He must think she can take her.
- Jesus H.

43:28.921 --> 43:31.521
Your left. Keep your left up.

43:31.961 --> 43:34.961
You think she can hear you
from back here?

43:42.001 --> 43:45.761
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

43:45.921 --> 43:47.921
Might even help him.

43:48.081 --> 43:50.001
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

43:50.161 --> 43:54.761
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

43:55.001 --> 43:57.361
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

43:57.521 --> 43:58.921
Hey, what do I know?

43:59.121 --> 44:01.841
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

44:02.041 --> 44:04.601
Mother of God.

44:05.961 --> 44:06.961
Okay, break.

44:07.121 --> 44:09.481
Hey. Come here, come here.

44:09.641 --> 44:11.081
Hey. Get over here.

44:11.241 --> 44:14.081
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

44:14.241 --> 44:16.961
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

44:17.121 --> 44:20.561
You're doing a hell of a job. Is this
the way you advise your lightweight?

44:21.041 --> 44:22.641
Dunn.

44:22.801 --> 44:25.281
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking. What are you doing?

44:25.481 --> 44:27.401
- Is this your fighter?
- It's my fighter.

44:28.721 --> 44:30.961
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

44:31.121 --> 44:34.281
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

44:34.441 --> 44:38.801
- Somebody tell me what's going on.
- I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

44:38.961 --> 44:41.441
You telling me this is your fighter?

44:43.641 --> 44:46.001
Yeah, this is my fighter.

44:46.161 --> 44:47.881
Then you got 10 seconds.

44:48.161 --> 44:51.321
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.561
- Well, let it drop.
- That'd be a lot easier.

44:53.761 --> 44:54.921
She thinks she knows you.

44:55.081 --> 44:58.121
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

44:58.281 --> 45:01.521
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

45:01.681 --> 45:04.681
- When she cocks that right hand... You hear?
- I hear you, boss.

45:04.841 --> 45:07.841
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

45:08.001 --> 45:09.361
- Got one?
- Got it right here.

45:09.641 --> 45:12.321
- Okay.
- Fight, or I'm calling it.

45:12.481 --> 45:15.481
- Go give it to her.
<i>- The body knows what fighters don't.</i>

45:15.641 --> 45:16.841
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

45:17.521 --> 45:19.841
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

45:20.001 --> 45:23.201
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

45:23.361 --> 45:27.521
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing."</i>

45:27.681 --> 45:29.521
Neutral corner.

45:31.041 --> 45:32.881
- See the way she did that?
- Yeah.

45:33.041 --> 45:36.041
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

45:36.201 --> 45:41.841
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses."</i>

45:42.001 --> 45:44.201
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

45:44.361 --> 45:48.081
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

45:48.241 --> 45:50.201
Thanks, boss.

45:50.601 --> 45:52.921
You.... You forgot the rule.

45:53.081 --> 45:55.561
- Now, what is the rule?
- Keep my left up?

45:55.721 --> 45:58.681
It's to protect yourself at all times.

45:59.241 --> 46:00.801
Now, what is the rule?

46:00.961 --> 46:04.321
- Protect myself at all times.
- Good, good.

46:04.481 --> 46:06.721
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

46:08.321 --> 46:09.561
It wasn't.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.201
It's okay.

46:12.921 --> 46:16.761
- I'll work on my left, boss.
- Drink your water.

46:17.841 --> 46:19.521
Other than that, how'd I do?

46:19.961 --> 46:22.841
Fine. You did fine.

46:23.801 --> 46:25.321
You gonna leave me again?

46:27.521 --> 46:29.161
Never.

46:29.321 --> 46:33.721
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

46:34.281 --> 46:36.881
- Sure.
- Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

46:37.041 --> 46:40.761
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

46:43.241 --> 46:46.281
- I want you to take the weekend off.
- It's only Thursday.

46:47.481 --> 46:51.121
- You gonna argue with me?
- Know better than to do that, boss.

46:51.721 --> 46:53.521
Well, good.

46:53.681 --> 46:56.361
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

46:56.841 --> 47:00.241
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

47:00.401 --> 47:04.681
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

47:06.281 --> 47:10.121
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

47:10.281 --> 47:13.281
<i>even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

47:13.481 --> 47:18.321
<i>if you can beat that last bit out of
them, then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

47:18.481 --> 47:21.761
- Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
- You sure did, boss.

47:22.401 --> 47:23.641
That was last night.

47:23.801 --> 47:26.641
You said not to argue with you.

47:38.041 --> 47:40.761
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

47:40.921 --> 47:42.881
You want my advice?

47:43.041 --> 47:44.481
What?

47:45.441 --> 47:46.961
Where are your shoes?

47:48.281 --> 47:50.321
I'm airing out my feet.

47:52.041 --> 47:53.921
You got big holes in your socks.

47:54.961 --> 47:56.961
Oh, they're not that big.

47:58.721 --> 48:01.001
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

48:02.641 --> 48:04.361
These are my sleeping socks.

48:05.681 --> 48:08.361
My feet like a little air at night.

48:08.921 --> 48:11.201
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

48:11.361 --> 48:14.361
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

48:16.641 --> 48:22.201
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

48:22.521 --> 48:24.201
Please?

48:26.521 --> 48:30.361
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

48:30.561 --> 48:32.521
Might find its way to the track.

48:49.001 --> 48:52.241
It's over. It's over.

49:07.081 --> 49:09.761
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

49:21.201 --> 49:22.641
I got the breathing thing down.

49:22.801 --> 49:26.401
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

49:26.561 --> 49:30.121
- Thought that was the point.
- The point is to get good.

49:30.721 --> 49:33.321
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

49:33.481 --> 49:35.681
How am I gonna get you fights?

49:37.441 --> 49:39.761
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

49:39.961 --> 49:42.601
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

49:43.121 --> 49:45.361
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

49:45.521 --> 49:48.761
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

49:52.681 --> 49:55.001
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

49:56.361 --> 49:58.281
<i>just to let her know who was boss.</i>

50:02.321 --> 50:05.321
Three, four, five...

50:05.481 --> 50:07.641
six, seven....

50:07.801 --> 50:09.401
Sorry, boss.

50:09.561 --> 50:11.641
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

50:20.521 --> 50:23.801
All right, let's do it.

50:24.921 --> 50:28.921
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

50:43.681 --> 50:45.521
Get up!

50:46.001 --> 50:47.361
To your corner.

50:47.521 --> 50:50.681
- Three, four, five...
- Get up.

50:50.841 --> 50:53.081
- six, seven...
- Get up.

50:53.241 --> 50:56.321
- eight, nine, ten. It's over.
- You can do this.

50:57.641 --> 51:02.041
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

51:02.201 --> 51:06.361
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

51:10.361 --> 51:13.441
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

51:13.641 --> 51:17.681
<i>sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

51:29.681 --> 51:32.161
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

51:32.321 --> 51:35.441
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

51:35.601 --> 51:36.681
<i>He took a chance.</i>

51:39.881 --> 51:41.201
Box.

51:45.521 --> 51:48.041
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

51:48.201 --> 51:51.081
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

52:03.921 --> 52:05.361
Watch the right!

52:07.721 --> 52:09.921
Watch it. Watch it.

52:16.801 --> 52:20.681
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

52:29.281 --> 52:31.761
Damn, damn, damn.

52:34.201 --> 52:35.681
Give us two seconds, will you?

52:35.841 --> 52:37.601
- Okay.
- Just two seconds.

52:38.361 --> 52:40.641
- Your nose is broke.
- Oh, damn.

52:40.801 --> 52:42.561
- Fix it.
- I can't, I can't.

52:42.721 --> 52:45.241
- You can fix it.
- I can't. I've gotta call it.

52:45.441 --> 52:47.281
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

52:47.681 --> 52:50.521
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

52:50.681 --> 52:52.241
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

52:52.401 --> 52:55.641
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

52:57.121 --> 52:58.961
Bite down on this.

53:17.161 --> 53:20.241
- Inhale.
- What?

53:20.681 --> 53:22.361
Breathe in.

53:33.641 --> 53:36.361
- Okay, huh?
- Yeah, it's okay.

53:36.601 --> 53:39.681
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

53:39.841 --> 53:42.041
and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

53:42.201 --> 53:44.361
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

53:44.521 --> 53:46.281
Now get going.

53:59.041 --> 54:00.881
Go to your corner.

54:02.041 --> 54:04.801
Three, four, five...

54:04.961 --> 54:08.681
- Come on, breathe. Breathe.
- six, seven, eight...

54:08.841 --> 54:10.281
nine, ten.

54:14.361 --> 54:15.841
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

54:21.401 --> 54:23.121
- All right!
- Yeah!

54:25.001 --> 54:26.401
Right.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.361
What you reading?

54:33.281 --> 54:34.521
What's she saying?

54:35.121 --> 54:37.401
Wants to know what you're reading.

54:37.641 --> 54:40.481
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

54:41.401 --> 54:43.361
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

54:43.561 --> 54:46.161
Show her what a treat that is.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.721
When the hell they gonna get to her?

54:48.881 --> 54:51.121
I'm okay, Frankie.

54:51.881 --> 54:54.841
- What'd you learn tonight?
- Always protect myself.

54:55.001 --> 54:58.081
- What's the rule?
- Always protect myself.

54:58.281 --> 55:00.161
- Margaret Fitzgerald?
- Here.

55:04.681 --> 55:06.641
I'll be right here.

55:18.601 --> 55:21.081
- How you doing?
- Me?

55:21.241 --> 55:23.201
- Yeah, you.
- I'm not the one who's hurt.

55:28.081 --> 55:29.881
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

55:30.641 --> 55:32.921
Why are you telling me that?

55:35.121 --> 55:36.481
No reason.

55:36.641 --> 55:40.801
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

55:41.121 --> 55:45.641
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

55:45.801 --> 55:49.201
- Did you write your daughter?
- Every week.

55:50.721 --> 55:53.721
I've no idea why you come to church.

56:24.921 --> 56:29.641
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

56:32.201 --> 56:34.801
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

56:35.001 --> 56:37.361
<i>for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

56:39.281 --> 56:41.081
<i>Billie "The Blue Bear."</i>

56:41.241 --> 56:44.361
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

56:44.521 --> 56:48.761
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

57:07.201 --> 57:08.601
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

57:08.761 --> 57:11.401
<i>that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

57:12.321 --> 57:14.521
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

57:17.441 --> 57:20.401
<i>He turned it down
without even telling her.</i>

57:20.561 --> 57:22.881
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

57:23.041 --> 57:26.321
<i>- a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.</i>
- Hello?

57:27.121 --> 57:29.121
Not interested.

57:31.961 --> 57:34.561
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

57:36.721 --> 57:39.001
That's a lot of money, boss.

57:39.161 --> 57:42.641
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

57:42.801 --> 57:44.521
It's a title match, right?

57:44.681 --> 57:47.681
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

57:47.841 --> 57:51.201
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

57:51.961 --> 57:54.561
Might still be a good fight.

57:54.721 --> 57:58.281
Yeah, I just... I just brought you up
to welterweight.

57:58.441 --> 58:01.921
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

58:02.081 --> 58:05.041
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

58:05.881 --> 58:09.041
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

58:10.121 --> 58:13.041
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

58:13.201 --> 58:15.761
I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

58:19.081 --> 58:22.641
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

58:52.641 --> 58:54.481
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

58:55.521 --> 58:57.321
I made us a reservation.

58:58.681 --> 59:01.121
You might wanna shower.

59:22.441 --> 59:26.641
Here you go.

59:27.161 --> 59:28.881
What's this?

59:29.041 --> 59:32.321
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

59:32.881 --> 59:34.321
Go on and blow.

59:39.201 --> 59:40.961
Thank you.

59:45.041 --> 59:47.561
Thirty-three ain't so old.

59:48.321 --> 59:51.121
I was still fighting at 39.

59:52.441 --> 59:54.961
Fought for 23 years.

59:58.721 --> 01:00:00.401
How's it going, Scrap?

01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:02.241
Doing good, Mickey.

01:00:03.281 --> 01:00:05.081
Doing good.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:09.041
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

01:00:14.521 --> 01:00:16.801
You two not speaking?

01:00:17.241 --> 01:00:19.441
Don't hardly know him.

01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:28.601
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:32.241
He was picking up cut work.

01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:36.881
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

01:00:38.241 --> 01:00:40.241
Good man to have in your corner.

01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:43.121
Yes, he is.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.881
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

01:00:48.641 --> 01:00:52.121
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:56.121
and it was just Frankie and me.

01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:00.841
I was taking a hellacious beating.

01:01:02.281 --> 01:01:05.641
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:09.241
Nobody tells you what that number is.

01:01:10.161 --> 01:01:12.841
Mine was 109.

01:01:13.481 --> 01:01:15.721
I just didn't want to admit it.

01:01:17.481 --> 01:01:19.801
Fourth round, this...

01:01:20.521 --> 01:01:22.001
cut opens up.

01:01:22.441 --> 01:01:25.241
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:31.121
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.481
Blood was what I was there for.

01:01:34.321 --> 01:01:37.921
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:40.481
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

01:01:40.681 --> 01:01:44.001
but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.161
Round after round...

01:01:47.521 --> 01:01:49.801
he's arguing with me.

01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:55.281
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

01:01:56.201 --> 01:01:58.681
I go 15 rounds...

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.081
lose by decision.

01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:04.121
Next morning, I lose the eye.

01:02:06.601 --> 01:02:10.161
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

01:02:11.081 --> 01:02:15.161
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

01:02:16.001 --> 01:02:17.801
Somehow...

01:02:18.761 --> 01:02:21.441
Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:24.641
should've saved my eye.

01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:30.961
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:34.721
I wanted to go to 110.

01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:37.361
Thing is...

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:39.801
if you wanna get to the title...

01:02:41.121 --> 01:02:43.801
maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:51.161
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

01:02:54.321 --> 01:02:56.561
You go on, eat your cupcake.

01:02:56.761 --> 01:02:59.441
No, I got it.

01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:06.401
<i>It's the rule.</i>

01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:08.961
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:12.401
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:17.601
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

01:03:21.921 --> 01:03:23.881
Mr. Mickey Mack?

01:03:24.081 --> 01:03:26.401
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

01:03:26.681 --> 01:03:32.441
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:35.961
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:39.881
so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

01:03:41.921 --> 01:03:44.281
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:52.201
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:29.241
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:31.641
<i>"Return to sender."</i>

01:05:01.161 --> 01:05:03.721
I'll make you some coffee.

01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:07.321
What are you doing with your money?

01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:10.041
- Saving it.
- Good girl.

01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:15.241
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:16.761
Cash, no mortgage.

01:05:16.921 --> 01:05:19.521
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:25.841
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

01:05:26.001 --> 01:05:28.641
but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

01:05:28.801 --> 01:05:32.081
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:33.881
You understand?

01:05:34.201 --> 01:05:38.001
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

01:05:38.161 --> 01:05:40.161
Okay, soon as I get the money.

01:05:40.321 --> 01:05:44.401
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm
just trying to keep you from doing the same.

01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:46.481
I know, boss.

01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:50.241
- I'm not gonna live forever.
- What is it?

01:05:50.401 --> 01:05:53.081
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

01:05:53.361 --> 01:05:56.601
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to... Hey.

01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:59.441
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

01:05:59.601 --> 01:06:02.281
- Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:06.841
You're welcome, darling. Here, just...
Here, let me put this in the machine.

01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:09.041
What machine?

01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:11.241
Don't have a TV, huh?

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.161
No.

01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:15.601
Yeah!

01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:18.761
All right. Okay.

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:27.361
- Ten minutes, love.
- Thank you.

01:06:27.681 --> 01:06:29.121
Man says he loves me.

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:31.361
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:33.801
First since my daddy.

01:06:34.401 --> 01:06:36.081
I win, you think he'll propose?

01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:38.601
You win, I'll propose.

01:06:42.401 --> 01:06:44.321
Look, I got you a gift here.

01:06:49.521 --> 01:06:51.361
I think they gave you somebody else's.

01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:53.481
No, no, this is it.

01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:56.001
What's it mean?

01:06:56.161 --> 01:07:00.001
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

01:07:00.961 --> 01:07:04.641
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, I thought so.

01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:06.641
- Yeah.
- Real silk thread.

01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:14.601
From the United
States of America, the challenger...

01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:18.081
Maggie Fitzgerald.

01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:21.961
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>
Did you see what was on her robe?

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.401
<i>- Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
- Mo cuishle.</i>

01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.481
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

01:07:30.641 --> 01:07:34.321
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:36.681
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

01:07:36.841 --> 01:07:39.841
<i>they couldn't tell you who else
fought that night.</i>

01:07:46.321 --> 01:07:47.641
Box.

01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.721
- Come on!
<i>- Mo cuishle</i>!

01:08:10.401 --> 01:08:14.561
<i>Mo cuishle</i>! <i>Mo cuishle</i>! <i>Mo cuishle</i>!

01:08:15.761 --> 01:08:17.401
<i>Mo cuishle</i>!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.801
<i>Mo cuishle</i>!

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.680
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:35.201
She's tough.

01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:39.321
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.961
- You know why that is?
- Why?

01:08:42.441 --> 01:08:44.321
She's a better fighter than you are,
that's why.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.600
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

01:08:48.761 --> 01:08:50.961
what are you gonna do about it?

01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:00.121
Get in there.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.121
Box.

01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:21.520
Three, four, five, six...

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.761
seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.121
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:09:38.281 --> 01:09:41.600
<i>- Mo cuishle!
- Mo cuishle!</i>

01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:50.961
I could ask someone, you know?

01:09:51.481 --> 01:09:52.841
Good.

01:09:53.001 --> 01:09:55.041
You find out, you let me know.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.041
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.801
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:12.801
<i>It was always</i> mo cuishle.

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.361
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

01:10:15.521 --> 01:10:17.841
<i>or people who wanna be.</i>

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:20.761
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

01:10:21.601 --> 01:10:24.681
<i>Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:45.041
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:10:56.121 --> 01:10:59.321
<i>After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.</i>

01:11:01.681 --> 01:11:03.561
What's the split?

01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:06.561
- Sixty-forty.
- Good.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:10.681
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:12.561
That little girl?

01:11:13.001 --> 01:11:16.321
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:20.281
that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

01:11:20.441 --> 01:11:23.521
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

01:11:23.721 --> 01:11:26.281
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:32.401
There you go.

01:11:35.681 --> 01:11:39.481
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

01:11:40.281 --> 01:11:41.961
How's that girl doing?

01:11:42.161 --> 01:11:45.281
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

01:11:45.441 --> 01:11:47.401
She be all right?

01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:51.441
- And if she isn't?
- Maybe I should send her something.

01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:55.801
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

01:12:00.801 --> 01:12:02.561
Boss?

01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:04.641
That little house we talked about?

01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:06.441
I bought it.

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:09.481
Well, smart girl.

01:12:10.121 --> 01:12:13.961
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:16.241
No mortgage, just like you said.

01:12:18.481 --> 01:12:20.601
You're a good daughter.

01:12:21.241 --> 01:12:23.321
She don't know about it yet.

01:12:23.481 --> 01:12:27.001
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

01:12:27.201 --> 01:12:29.161
I know she wants to meet you.

01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:34.321
Yeah, we could do that.

01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:54.561
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:56.921
Mary M.'s here.

01:13:14.001 --> 01:13:18.041
- This is the Johnsons' old house.
- Not anymore.

01:13:21.761 --> 01:13:25.561
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

01:13:25.761 --> 01:13:29.561
- Mary M., you bought this for me?
- Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

01:13:29.721 --> 01:13:31.401
Darling....

01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:33.921
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:36.401
They'll be here before you move in.

01:13:37.641 --> 01:13:40.041
- How much money did this cost you?
- Never mind that.

01:13:40.201 --> 01:13:42.881
- You shouldn't have done this.
- You need a decent place.

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:46.401
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:50.961
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:55.001
- Mama, no, they ain't.
- They are. You're fine, you're working...

01:13:55.161 --> 01:13:57.041
but I can't live without my welfare.

01:13:57.201 --> 01:13:58.881
Mama, I'll send you money.

01:13:59.121 --> 01:14:02.401
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

01:14:02.561 --> 01:14:06.241
- How am I supposed to get my medicine?
- I'll send you more money.

01:14:06.561 --> 01:14:08.841
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

01:14:09.001 --> 01:14:10.241
He's getting out, you know.

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:13.441
Why didn't you just give me the money?

01:14:14.481 --> 01:14:17.081
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:22.841
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:25.161
You want the money, sell it.

01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:33.361
I don't...

01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:41.761
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

01:14:41.961 --> 01:14:44.361
but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:48.081
- That's true, Mama.
- I'll try and keep the house.

01:14:48.561 --> 01:14:50.921
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

01:14:51.081 --> 01:14:52.961
I'll send you some more money.

01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:04.401
That man hitting you?

01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:08.081
It's from the fight.

01:15:08.481 --> 01:15:10.001
I'm a fighter, Mama.

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:12.841
Find a man, Mary M.

01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:14.681
Live proper.

01:15:14.841 --> 01:15:17.841
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:21.121
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.601
Hi.

01:16:44.681 --> 01:16:47.041
You ever own a dog?

01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:48.721
Nope.

01:16:48.921 --> 01:16:53.481
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

01:16:55.521 --> 01:16:59.921
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:01.761
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

01:17:01.921 --> 01:17:05.561
he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:08.681
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:12.681
watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

01:17:13.201 --> 01:17:16.921
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:21.881
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

01:17:22.081 --> 01:17:26.441
and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

01:17:27.241 --> 01:17:30.681
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:33.481
the shovel in the back of the truck.

01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:41.241
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

01:17:50.201 --> 01:17:52.721
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

01:17:55.961 --> 01:17:57.841
Well, you've got me.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:04.481
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

01:18:12.481 --> 01:18:16.401
Hey, can we stop just up here?

01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:18.481
Yeah.

01:18:19.001 --> 01:18:21.961
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

01:18:22.121 --> 01:18:25.041
None of that canned-filling crap.

01:18:34.801 --> 01:18:36.521
Mmm.

01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:42.321
Now I can die and go to heaven.

01:18:47.201 --> 01:18:49.161
I used to come here with Daddy.

01:18:50.321 --> 01:18:52.881
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

01:18:53.041 --> 01:18:55.521
I got a little bit of savings.

01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:05.121
That's fine, fine, thanks.

01:19:09.841 --> 01:19:11.921
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

01:19:12.721 --> 01:19:15.001
Looks like another bottle of water.

01:19:15.161 --> 01:19:17.521
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

01:19:17.881 --> 01:19:20.721
Watch you suffer
over the nickel slots? Uh-uh.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:22.641
My heart can't take
that kind of pounding.

01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:26.401
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:28.601
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

01:19:28.761 --> 01:19:30.561
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:32.361
Well, I could use a good second.

01:19:32.521 --> 01:19:34.281
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:36.561
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:41.161
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

01:19:41.321 --> 01:19:45.081
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

01:19:45.241 --> 01:19:47.241
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:50.881
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

01:19:52.441 --> 01:19:54.081
Somebody with young hands.

01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:57.361
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

01:19:59.121 --> 01:20:01.001
I leave this place for one day...

01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:04.001
got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

01:20:04.201 --> 01:20:06.041
Kind of like it looks right now.

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.601
Oh, go to hell.

01:20:09.441 --> 01:20:12.521
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:14.481
Will do.

01:20:18.561 --> 01:20:20.521
- Hey, Mr. Scrap.
- Mm-hm.

01:20:20.721 --> 01:20:24.001
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

01:20:24.161 --> 01:20:26.401
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

01:20:26.601 --> 01:20:28.361
Okay.

01:20:30.641 --> 01:20:34.721
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

01:20:34.881 --> 01:20:36.961
I've been thinking on it.

01:20:37.121 --> 01:20:38.881
Can't figure it out.

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.681
Why don't I show you, Danger.

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:44.241
- You could do that? You could show me?
- I think so. I think so.

01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:49.441
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:55.721
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

01:20:55.921 --> 01:20:58.841
- We're flying?
- Would you rather drive?

01:21:00.161 --> 01:21:01.921
You're asking me?

01:21:02.481 --> 01:21:05.321
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.241
So I finally get to decide something?

01:21:08.401 --> 01:21:09.841
That's what I'm saying.

01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:11.601
Fine.

01:21:11.761 --> 01:21:13.521
Fly there, drive back.

01:21:13.961 --> 01:21:17.521
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

01:21:17.841 --> 01:21:19.481
You said it was up to me.

01:21:29.601 --> 01:21:31.841
Give them hell there, Danger.

01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:35.081
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

01:21:39.401 --> 01:21:42.201
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

01:21:44.201 --> 01:21:45.961
Jesus.

01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:48.841
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:21:49.281 --> 01:21:51.401
Oh, God!

01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:57.121
Dumb-ass.

01:21:57.561 --> 01:21:59.961
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:01.561
Come on. Defense!

01:22:02.201 --> 01:22:04.481
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:07.201
drinking Mai tais...

01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:09.561
looking at naked women.

01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:13.001
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

01:22:15.761 --> 01:22:17.601
Danger, get out of there!

01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:26.841
Fight back! Come on!

01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:29.641
- There you go, Danger, there you go!
- Good job, man.

01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:31.841
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

01:22:32.001 --> 01:22:33.241
Come on.

01:22:42.441 --> 01:22:43.881
Hey, come on now, Flip.

01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:46.201
- What you doing? Let him go.
- All right. Okay.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:48.721
I got you. Come on, come on.

01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:51.841
It's all right.

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:54.841
We don't need no corner trainer.

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:56.401
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

01:22:56.561 --> 01:22:58.441
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

01:22:58.601 --> 01:23:00.761
You my man. You rock.

01:23:00.961 --> 01:23:02.881
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

01:23:03.041 --> 01:23:05.801
You ain't even fight good yet.

01:23:05.961 --> 01:23:07.921
Anybody can lose one fight.

01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:10.521
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:12.361
You'll be champion of the world.

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.801
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

01:23:15.801 --> 01:23:17.481
I should have knowed.

01:23:17.641 --> 01:23:19.161
Come on.
We don't need to be talking.

01:23:19.321 --> 01:23:20.321
Let me help you.

01:23:20.521 --> 01:23:23.921
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:25.961
All right.

01:23:27.441 --> 01:23:30.921
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

01:23:32.361 --> 01:23:35.121
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:38.081
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:40.361
Come on, now.

01:23:40.521 --> 01:23:44.481
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

01:23:45.081 --> 01:23:48.641
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

01:23:56.441 --> 01:23:59.601
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

01:24:00.721 --> 01:24:02.001
Keep going, man.

01:24:02.161 --> 01:24:03.881
All right, man.

01:24:11.241 --> 01:24:12.721
He ain't so tough.

01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:15.001
One hundred and ten.

01:24:19.881 --> 01:24:21.561
Get a job, punk.

01:24:53.041 --> 01:24:56.001
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

01:24:57.001 --> 01:24:59.081
I got you some pipers.

01:25:12.761 --> 01:25:16.641
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:21.081
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:25:29.921 --> 01:25:31.401
All right, now!

01:26:21.241 --> 01:26:23.641
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

01:26:23.801 --> 01:26:25.961
until they turn blue and fall off.

01:26:42.081 --> 01:26:45.481
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:47.841
presentation of the evening.

01:26:48.001 --> 01:26:52.601
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:54.841
in the red corner.

01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:56.641
In the blue corner...

01:26:56.801 --> 01:27:01.161
the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:04.201
Billie "The Blue Bear."

01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:09.161
Sweet Jesus.

01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:27.121
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing
The Blue Bear around the ring.</i>

01:27:27.281 --> 01:27:28.321
<i>She's coming on strong.</i>

01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:34.201
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:36.561
<i>- And a right hook stuns the champ.</i>
- All right.

01:27:38.601 --> 01:27:39.881
Break it up!

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:44.801
Break it! Break it!

01:27:50.921 --> 01:27:53.721
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

01:27:55.921 --> 01:27:57.201
Go fight.

01:28:05.161 --> 01:28:07.001
You motherfucker.

01:28:15.161 --> 01:28:17.601
Come on. What the fuck?

01:28:17.761 --> 01:28:20.521
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

01:28:20.681 --> 01:28:22.921
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

01:28:24.601 --> 01:28:26.121
<i>comes back, hits Fitzgerald....</i>

01:28:26.281 --> 01:28:27.721
Ref, open your eyes, you....

01:28:45.761 --> 01:28:46.961
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:49.441
<i>the first round is in the books
on this championship match.</i>

01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:55.401
- Hold onto that.
- There you go.

01:29:00.161 --> 01:29:02.521
- Looking good.
- You pull that crap one more time...

01:29:02.681 --> 01:29:04.481
you're disqualified.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:14.321
It's gonna be all right.

01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:16.201
Got no doubt, boss.

01:29:19.081 --> 01:29:21.641
Okay, just watch yourself.

01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:23.201
Stay away from this dame.

01:29:35.681 --> 01:29:38.401
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:42.721
- Four, five, six...
- Stay down, you bitch.

01:29:42.881 --> 01:29:46.321
seven, eight, nine.

01:29:59.281 --> 01:30:00.681
Yeah, yeah!

01:30:02.361 --> 01:30:03.881
Break it! Break it!

01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:14.641
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....</i>

01:30:28.401 --> 01:30:30.121
Yes! Come on!

01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:31.841
I got it! I got it.

01:30:38.561 --> 01:30:40.001
Eyes are blurring, boss.

01:30:40.161 --> 01:30:42.921
- How many eyes you need to finish this?
- One's enough.

01:30:46.361 --> 01:30:48.001
- Good.
- Now...

01:30:48.161 --> 01:30:49.721
what do I do about the Bear?

01:30:49.881 --> 01:30:52.801
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:56.601
- I been doing that. She's made of steel.
- I don't want you to go to the liver.

01:30:56.761 --> 01:30:59.681
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

01:30:59.841 --> 01:31:02.921
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

01:31:03.081 --> 01:31:05.161
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

01:31:05.521 --> 01:31:08.321
- What about the ref?
- Keep between the ref and the Bear...

01:31:08.481 --> 01:31:10.281
and everything will just be fine.

01:31:12.441 --> 01:31:14.281
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

01:31:14.441 --> 01:31:16.041
You keep it up.

01:31:29.601 --> 01:31:30.961
Oh, yeah!

01:31:41.961 --> 01:31:43.641
Break, break!

01:31:50.481 --> 01:31:54.121
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

01:32:23.921 --> 01:32:25.361
Doctor.

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:41.361
Come on.

01:32:41.761 --> 01:32:43.281
Breathe.

01:32:43.441 --> 01:32:46.041
That's it. Breathe.

01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:48.121
Good.

01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:49.841
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:51.841
Breathe.

01:32:52.521 --> 01:32:54.041
Good.

01:32:54.441 --> 01:32:55.841
That's it.

01:32:57.161 --> 01:32:58.401
Breathe.

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.681
How you feeling, darling?

01:33:57.241 --> 01:33:59.481
Growing a beard, boss?

01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:03.161
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

01:34:05.121 --> 01:34:07.361
Can't say it does.

01:34:34.761 --> 01:34:37.161
Does it...? Does it hurt much?

01:34:38.961 --> 01:34:41.161
Don't hurt at all.

01:34:43.081 --> 01:34:44.681
Well, that's good.

01:34:50.321 --> 01:34:52.001
Where's Frankie?

01:34:54.081 --> 01:34:55.481
Well, he's....

01:34:55.641 --> 01:34:58.081
He's out there talking to the doctors.

01:34:58.241 --> 01:35:01.321
Probably telling them how to do their job.

01:35:03.601 --> 01:35:07.961
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

01:35:11.161 --> 01:35:15.881
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

01:35:19.521 --> 01:35:23.161
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

01:35:28.121 --> 01:35:32.041
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.441
Did you see the fight?

01:35:45.041 --> 01:35:46.721
Of course I did.

01:35:47.761 --> 01:35:49.721
You had her cold, Maggie.

01:35:51.281 --> 01:35:54.321
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

01:35:58.161 --> 01:36:00.361
I shouldn't have turned.

01:36:07.321 --> 01:36:09.201
Always protect myself.

01:36:09.361 --> 01:36:12.481
How many times he tell me that?

01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:15.081
Yeah...

01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:18.321
he does like to repeat himself.

01:36:22.081 --> 01:36:25.401
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

01:36:29.481 --> 01:36:30.921
No.

01:36:31.641 --> 01:36:33.921
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:55.601
Damnedest thing.

01:36:59.441 --> 01:37:01.241
So, what's the plan?

01:37:02.121 --> 01:37:05.401
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:07.321
It's your fault.

01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:10.961
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

01:37:11.121 --> 01:37:13.081
You kept after me until I trained her.

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.481
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

01:37:17.521 --> 01:37:19.961
Everything kept telling me not to.

01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:21.921
Everything but you.

01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:34.041
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:36.161
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:39.321
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

01:37:40.161 --> 01:37:42.441
As soon as you're able to be moved...

01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:46.361
we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:51.201
You just rest there, I'll....

01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:54.641
I'm on it.

01:38:03.681 --> 01:38:06.081
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

01:38:06.281 --> 01:38:09.081
<i>looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

01:38:09.241 --> 01:38:13.321
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

01:38:13.641 --> 01:38:15.601
<i>said there was nothing to be done.</i>

01:38:16.161 --> 01:38:19.361
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:27.161
They got nurses for that, you know.

01:38:28.561 --> 01:38:30.881
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:47.321
<i>She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.</i>

01:38:58.361 --> 01:38:59.961
Thank you.

01:39:09.921 --> 01:39:13.241
<i>They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.</i>

01:39:24.641 --> 01:39:27.521
Fly there, drive back.

01:39:33.841 --> 01:39:37.321
<i>The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.</i>

01:39:37.761 --> 01:39:39.601
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

01:39:39.761 --> 01:39:41.881
<i>She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't.</i>

01:39:43.121 --> 01:39:47.121
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

01:39:52.281 --> 01:39:54.641
One, two, three, up.

01:39:57.001 --> 01:39:59.321
<i>Since she couldn't breathe on her own...</i>

01:39:59.521 --> 01:40:02.121
<i>her respirators were always on.</i>

01:40:03.401 --> 01:40:07.241
<i>Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.</i>

01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:36.801
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:40.601
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

01:40:41.561 --> 01:40:42.841
Sure.

01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:45.641
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

01:40:45.801 --> 01:40:49.801
<i>Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.</i>

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:53.361
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:00.121
You don't have to hang around all day.

01:41:01.441 --> 01:41:02.961
Oh....

01:41:03.921 --> 01:41:06.921
I like it here. I don't mind.

01:41:07.641 --> 01:41:11.601
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

01:41:14.481 --> 01:41:17.441
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

01:41:17.841 --> 01:41:19.641
Well, it's no burden.

01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:22.001
Here.

01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:25.321
Read this.

01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:36.561
Okay, okay, that's enough.

01:41:37.041 --> 01:41:38.521
That's terrible.

01:41:41.001 --> 01:41:44.041
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

01:41:46.921 --> 01:41:48.401
It says:

01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:52.121
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

01:41:52.281 --> 01:41:56.841
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

01:41:57.761 --> 01:42:02.121
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

01:42:02.761 --> 01:42:07.441
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

01:42:09.801 --> 01:42:11.201
Not bad, huh?

01:42:15.681 --> 01:42:17.881
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

01:42:18.561 --> 01:42:20.401
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:25.481
You know, when you quit all this.

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:29.121
You mean boxing?

01:42:29.641 --> 01:42:32.281
No, I'll never quit.

01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:35.801
I like the stink too much, I guess.

01:42:41.681 --> 01:42:44.201
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

01:42:44.361 --> 01:42:46.761
with your books and lemon pie.

01:42:48.921 --> 01:42:51.801
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

01:42:53.841 --> 01:42:56.121
I could learn how to bake.

01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:01.601
Well, then, I'll....

01:43:01.761 --> 01:43:03.921
Maybe I'll start looking then.

01:43:25.681 --> 01:43:27.161
Yeah.

01:43:29.921 --> 01:43:32.361
- Go ahead.
- All right. Okay, sounds good.

01:43:36.241 --> 01:43:38.641
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:40.081
Where's my little girl?

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:43.121
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

01:43:43.281 --> 01:43:46.041
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

01:43:46.201 --> 01:43:49.681
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

01:43:49.841 --> 01:43:52.601
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

01:43:52.761 --> 01:43:54.201
There's some rides you missed.

01:43:54.361 --> 01:43:57.041
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

01:43:57.201 --> 01:43:59.441
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:01.801
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

01:44:01.961 --> 01:44:03.641
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

01:44:03.801 --> 01:44:06.761
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

01:44:08.281 --> 01:44:09.521
Margaret Fitzgerald?

01:44:09.961 --> 01:44:11.681
Right down here, 301.

01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:13.681
- Come on, Mama.
- Let's go.

01:44:20.201 --> 01:44:22.281
And I saw myself breathing.

01:44:22.441 --> 01:44:24.321
Like, my body was going up and down.

01:44:24.481 --> 01:44:27.321
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

01:44:30.761 --> 01:44:33.641
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

01:44:47.761 --> 01:44:49.081
It's just a....

01:44:50.081 --> 01:44:52.201
It's just some kind of legal thing.

01:44:52.441 --> 01:44:53.721
What is it?

01:44:53.881 --> 01:44:55.921
How we all doing here?

01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:58.641
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

01:44:58.801 --> 01:45:02.961
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money to
be here to make sure this is done proper.

01:45:03.161 --> 01:45:05.761
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

01:45:05.921 --> 01:45:07.521
Hey, old man...

01:45:07.681 --> 01:45:09.161
you part of our family?

01:45:10.121 --> 01:45:11.761
Stay the hell out of this.

01:45:13.361 --> 01:45:15.121
Read it to me, Mama.

01:45:15.281 --> 01:45:18.841
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

01:45:19.601 --> 01:45:21.121
Mama, you don't have to worry.

01:45:21.961 --> 01:45:25.401
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

01:45:25.801 --> 01:45:27.921
But what if they don't, Mary M?

01:45:28.081 --> 01:45:30.921
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

01:45:31.081 --> 01:45:34.241
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

01:45:34.441 --> 01:45:36.241
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:40.041
- Nothing.
- Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

01:45:40.201 --> 01:45:44.081
- Then I'll just read it to her later on...
- With respect, this ain't your business.

01:45:45.601 --> 01:45:47.961
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

01:45:54.241 --> 01:45:56.601
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

01:45:58.201 --> 01:46:00.001
You sign that paper...

01:46:00.361 --> 01:46:02.481
it'll take care of your family...

01:46:02.801 --> 01:46:05.001
the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

01:46:07.001 --> 01:46:08.521
Uh....

01:46:09.801 --> 01:46:11.801
How do you make your mark?

01:46:14.321 --> 01:46:15.521
Can you hold a pen?

01:46:15.681 --> 01:46:18.041
- She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.
- Huh?

01:46:18.201 --> 01:46:20.321
You gotta put it in her mouth.

01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:23.401
Here you go, honey.

01:46:26.521 --> 01:46:28.601
Did you see the fight, Mama?

01:46:28.841 --> 01:46:31.041
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

01:46:32.521 --> 01:46:34.201
I did pretty good.

01:46:34.361 --> 01:46:36.201
You lost, Mary M.

01:46:37.161 --> 01:46:40.881
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

01:46:42.481 --> 01:46:45.201
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

01:46:45.641 --> 01:46:47.201
There you go.

01:46:56.561 --> 01:46:58.441
What happened to you?

01:46:58.761 --> 01:47:00.481
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

01:47:02.321 --> 01:47:05.721
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

01:47:07.561 --> 01:47:10.881
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

01:47:11.081 --> 01:47:14.321
you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

01:47:17.161 --> 01:47:19.561
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

01:47:19.721 --> 01:47:22.961
from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

01:47:25.081 --> 01:47:28.321
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

01:48:09.601 --> 01:48:13.801
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

01:48:27.321 --> 01:48:29.481
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

01:48:32.401 --> 01:48:33.961
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

01:49:50.961 --> 01:49:53.841
They took my leg, boss.

01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:01.201
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

01:50:02.041 --> 01:50:05.401
I always hear your voice, boss.

01:50:37.201 --> 01:50:38.721
You need anything?

01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:45.121
I need to know what "<i>mo cuishle</i>" means.

01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:48.641
But you didn't win.

01:50:49.281 --> 01:50:51.161
I don't have to tell you.

01:50:54.921 --> 01:50:57.441
You're the meanest man I ever met.

01:50:57.601 --> 01:50:59.961
No wonder no one loves you.

01:51:03.521 --> 01:51:05.921
You remind me of my daddy.

01:51:08.641 --> 01:51:10.601
Well, he must have been...

01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:14.401
a very intelligent, handsome man.

01:51:18.241 --> 01:51:21.401
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

01:51:23.321 --> 01:51:24.721
No, I was...

01:51:26.241 --> 01:51:29.161
looking at this catalog
from City College.

01:51:31.441 --> 01:51:33.801
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

01:51:34.201 --> 01:51:37.641
maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:41.401
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

01:51:46.521 --> 01:51:48.881
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:52.841
Sure.

01:51:54.201 --> 01:51:56.241
Anything you want.

01:51:57.921 --> 01:52:00.881
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

01:52:13.761 --> 01:52:16.241
Don't even think about that.

01:52:20.121 --> 01:52:22.521
I can't be like this, Frankie.

01:52:25.801 --> 01:52:27.561
Not after what I done.

01:52:27.721 --> 01:52:29.721
I seen the world.

01:52:32.801 --> 01:52:35.001
People chanted my name.

01:52:36.001 --> 01:52:37.161
Well...

01:52:39.081 --> 01:52:42.601
not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

01:52:45.601 --> 01:52:48.081
But they were chanting for me.

01:52:51.601 --> 01:52:54.001
I was in magazines.

01:52:57.721 --> 01:53:00.521
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

01:53:04.921 --> 01:53:08.601
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

01:53:12.041 --> 01:53:15.641
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

01:53:18.961 --> 01:53:21.361
and I'd fight my way out.

01:53:26.281 --> 01:53:29.241
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:33.841
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

01:53:36.761 --> 01:53:38.201
I got what I needed.

01:53:42.161 --> 01:53:44.681
I got it all.

01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:51.241
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

01:53:56.281 --> 01:54:01.321
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

01:54:06.281 --> 01:54:08.521
I can't.

01:54:09.241 --> 01:54:11.321
Please.

01:54:13.361 --> 01:54:15.841
Please, don't ask me.

01:54:18.001 --> 01:54:20.081
I'm asking.

01:54:23.641 --> 01:54:25.521
I can't.

01:55:09.401 --> 01:55:11.401
Hello?

01:55:16.601 --> 01:55:18.881
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

01:55:19.041 --> 01:55:22.041
<i>Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

01:55:22.601 --> 01:55:24.761
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

01:55:31.881 --> 01:55:34.721
Stop. Stop.

01:55:38.201 --> 01:55:40.801
Look at me. Look at me.

01:55:55.121 --> 01:55:58.921
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

01:55:59.321 --> 01:56:03.721
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

01:56:04.001 --> 01:56:06.161
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:09.561
<i>padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

01:56:27.881 --> 01:56:30.201
You can't do it, you know that.

01:56:32.041 --> 01:56:34.001
I do, Father.

01:56:34.961 --> 01:56:36.961
But you don't know how thick she is...

01:56:37.121 --> 01:56:39.641
how hard it was to train her.

01:56:40.081 --> 01:56:43.961
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

01:56:44.121 --> 01:56:49.601
and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

01:56:50.321 --> 01:56:52.521
How she fought for the title, I....

01:56:52.681 --> 01:56:54.241
It wasn't by anything....

01:56:54.401 --> 01:56:57.441
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:08.801
But now she wants to die...

01:57:08.961 --> 01:57:11.161
and I just wanna keep her with me.

01:57:15.481 --> 01:57:19.761
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

01:57:20.201 --> 01:57:23.081
It's committing a sin by doing it.

01:57:23.241 --> 01:57:26.681
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

01:57:27.081 --> 01:57:30.081
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:34.281
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

01:57:34.441 --> 01:57:36.361
You leave her with God.

01:57:37.001 --> 01:57:40.601
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

01:57:40.761 --> 01:57:44.721
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

01:57:44.961 --> 01:57:46.961
The only person comes
to church that much...

01:57:47.121 --> 01:57:48.801
is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:51.321
Whatever sins you're carrying...

01:57:51.841 --> 01:57:54.281
they're nothing compared to this.

01:57:54.681 --> 01:57:58.841
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

01:57:59.001 --> 01:58:02.041
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

01:58:05.561 --> 01:58:07.801
Somewhere so deep...

01:58:09.601 --> 01:58:12.041
you'll never find yourself again.

01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:20.641
I think I did it already.

01:58:42.561 --> 01:58:45.881
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

01:59:51.081 --> 01:59:53.721
I went to see Maggie this morning.

01:59:55.481 --> 01:59:57.481
You must have been somewhere else.

01:59:58.681 --> 02:00:00.481
Yeah.

02:00:04.321 --> 02:00:06.441
You got a fight I don't know about?

02:00:11.841 --> 02:00:14.121
It wasn't your fault.

02:00:14.561 --> 02:00:16.681
I was wrong to say that.

02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:18.881
You're damn right.

02:00:20.321 --> 02:00:21.641
I found you a fighter...

02:00:21.801 --> 02:00:25.361
and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

02:00:27.921 --> 02:00:29.361
I killed her.

02:00:29.521 --> 02:00:31.401
Don't say that.

02:00:31.801 --> 02:00:34.361
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

02:00:34.521 --> 02:00:37.681
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

02:00:37.881 --> 02:00:41.281
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

02:00:41.441 --> 02:00:42.721
You did that.

02:00:44.921 --> 02:00:47.441
People die every day, Frankie.

02:00:47.641 --> 02:00:49.521
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

02:00:49.841 --> 02:00:51.761
And you know what
their last thought is?

02:00:51.921 --> 02:00:54.401
"I never got my shot."

02:00:54.881 --> 02:00:57.201
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

02:00:58.441 --> 02:01:02.161
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

02:01:03.001 --> 02:01:05.401
"I think I did all right."

02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:15.561
I know I could rest with that.

02:01:18.241 --> 02:01:19.281
Yeah.

02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:21.721
Yeah.

02:01:32.761 --> 02:01:34.441
Yeah.

02:02:12.721 --> 02:02:14.121
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

02:02:14.281 --> 02:02:15.801
Yeah.

02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:44.321
All right.

02:02:48.481 --> 02:02:51.001
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

02:02:51.841 --> 02:02:54.121
then you're gonna go to sleep.

02:02:58.841 --> 02:03:01.561
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll...

02:03:02.681 --> 02:03:04.281
stay asleep.

02:03:09.601 --> 02:03:11.361
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

02:03:12.921 --> 02:03:16.521
means "my darling, my blood."

02:04:24.601 --> 02:04:27.441
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

02:04:27.761 --> 02:04:32.001
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

02:04:32.361 --> 02:04:35.241
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

02:05:25.081 --> 02:05:26.761
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

02:05:27.361 --> 02:05:30.641
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

02:05:49.201 --> 02:05:51.481
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

02:05:51.761 --> 02:05:55.441
<i>Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.</i>

02:06:15.041 --> 02:06:18.481
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

02:06:21.041 --> 02:06:24.081
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

02:06:25.161 --> 02:06:26.841
What was that, Danger?

02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:31.041
Anybody can lose one fight.

02:06:32.281 --> 02:06:34.081
That's the truth.

02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:37.521
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

02:06:39.481 --> 02:06:41.921
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

02:07:00.761 --> 02:07:03.921
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

02:07:18.681 --> 02:07:22.841
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

02:07:23.201 --> 02:07:25.721
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

02:07:25.881 --> 02:07:28.921
<i>and ask you one more time
to forgive him.</i>

02:07:29.081 --> 02:07:32.481
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

02:07:32.641 --> 02:07:36.041
<i>I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.</i>

02:07:36.521 --> 02:07:39.641
<i>A place set in the cedars and oak trees.</i>

02:07:39.961 --> 02:07:43.161
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

02:07:43.321 --> 02:07:46.921
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>

02:07:47.441 --> 02:07:49.441
<i>No matter where he is...</i>

02:07:49.961 --> 02:07:54.681
<i>I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.</i>
