01:51.265 --> 01:53.318
I do not wish to comment on the work...

01:53.649 --> 01:57.545
If it does not speak for itself, it is a failure.

01:58.150 --> 02:02.366
I wanted to tell a story that could easily be understood by anyone.

02:01.831 --> 02:05.291
A story so simple even a child could understand it.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.515
The truth was too strange to tell any other way.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.047
I was not born for an age like this.

02:14.048 --> 02:15.048
I'm in.

02:16.955 --> 02:19.373
The world is being invaded by monsters...

02:19.374 --> 02:21.491
but I suppose you don't want to hear about that.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.424
I could be writing romantic novels...

02:24.668 --> 02:28.204
novels people actually want to read,
and maybe in a different age I would.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.865
But if I tell the story of the monsters
through talking farm animals...

02:32.866 --> 02:35.965
maybe then you will listen,
then you will understand.

02:35.966 --> 02:41.255
The future is at stake so,
please read carefully, between the lines.

02:48.528 --> 02:53.393
Mr. Chairman, from Manor Farm,
had locked the hen houses for the night,

02:56.923 --> 02:59.268
Hitler and Goebbels are both there...

02:59.269 --> 03:01.912
next thing you know,
we're strapped onto Hitler’s plane...

03:01.913 --> 03:06.643
to Richtoffen. The fastest and
most powerful plane in all of Germany.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.613
On the flight, Goebbels is reading the papers,

03:09.976 --> 03:14.767
while Hitler, ah.. Hitler...

03:14.804 --> 03:17.825
studies a map of Europe,

03:17.826 --> 03:19.333
and I couldn't help but think...

03:19.334 --> 03:24.737
if this plane should crash,
the whole history of Europe would be changed.

03:29.994 --> 03:33.206
Well... thank you young man
for that...

03:36.254 --> 03:39.590
But the Germans have their own
unrest to worry about.

03:39.591 --> 03:41.592
The Reichstag file is not unrest...

03:41.593 --> 03:43.702
It was a tactic.

03:43.703 --> 03:48.709
The Nazis now have an excuse
to end all opposition.

03:48.710 --> 03:50.479
But how can you be so certain?

03:50.883 --> 03:52.371
Goebbels told me.

03:52.372 --> 03:57.573
War begins in the minds of men.

03:57.574 --> 04:01.438
Goebbels believes the Reich will be here for a thousand years,

04:01.439 --> 04:05.778
which means that they will most certainly
expand to the east into Poland.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.778
The next great war gentlemen,
has already begun.

04:09.779 --> 04:12.079
Herr Hitler will soon learn,

04:12.080 --> 04:15.221
that there's a great deal of difference
between holding a rally...

04:15.222 --> 04:18.980
and running a country.

04:18.981 --> 04:26.414
I see Mr. Jones, has told you
we are at war.

04:30.492 --> 04:33.539
Sorry to interrupt, ah,
there's a call from Moscow.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.536
Who is it?

04:34.537 --> 04:36.812
It's for Mr. Jones.

04:38.808 --> 04:40.884
If you'll excuse me a moment gentlemen.

05:02.259 --> 05:03.777
Do you know who it was?

05:05.422 --> 05:07.561
They were speaking Russian.

05:36.188 --> 05:37.785
You must go home.

05:38.734 --> 05:40.603
If you have a home, don't you?

05:40.741 --> 05:42.164
This is my home.

05:47.766 --> 05:51.073
I never got to make my main strategic point,
which is...

05:51.073 --> 05:54.575
to resist Hitler, we will need
an alliance with Stalin.

05:54.428 --> 05:57.342
A man who performs miracles.

06:00.009 --> 06:02.432
Miss Stevenson, do you know how
much the Rouble is worth?

06:02.674 --> 06:03.837
Not very much.

06:03.838 --> 06:05.768
Global economic collapse.

06:05.769 --> 06:08.280
Meanwhile the Soviets are
having a spending spree.

06:08.741 --> 06:09.908
How?

06:17.828 --> 06:21.011
What's the matter?
Why have you poured me a cup of Tea?

06:23.572 --> 06:24.988
I was wrong.

06:26.022 --> 06:27.861
About your position.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.406
The cuts are deeper than expected.
There's...

06:31.407 --> 06:33.486
simply no money.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.233
I'm so sorry.

06:44.345 --> 06:46.681
He's waiting to see you
before you go.

07:21.965 --> 07:23.939
My boy...

07:28.435 --> 07:31.085
This depression, the casualties...

07:31.236 --> 07:32.980
It's like another great war.

07:34.171 --> 07:35.775
Goodbye sir.

07:37.322 --> 07:38.921
It was an honour to serve you.

07:38.922 --> 07:43.002
I couldn't have asked for a more
brilliant foreign advisor.

07:43.003 --> 07:44.186
Sir, you...

07:44.187 --> 07:48.728
you are surrounded by men
with decades of experience. But...

07:48.729 --> 07:54.018
it is me you need sir.
I'm the only one who tells you the truth.

07:54.019 --> 07:59.262
No-one else seems to understand
the gravity of the situation, sir.

07:59.263 --> 08:03.716
I took the liberty of writing you
a letter of recommendation.

08:10.634 --> 08:11.976
Thank you sir.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.267
Ah, this is for you.

08:16.268 --> 08:18.193
It's not finished, yet.

08:18.194 --> 08:20.911
It's my report on the Soviet question.

08:20.912 --> 08:22.516
And what's your answer?

08:22.517 --> 08:26.085
I don't have one.
Stalin isn't returning my calls.

08:28.348 --> 08:31.184
You could still send me to Moscow.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.414
Ask him where the money is coming from.

08:34.975 --> 08:39.246
But what happens after... your
conversation with Stalin?

08:40.879 --> 08:43.919
Ah, I will go back to Wales.

08:45.284 --> 08:48.282
Teach in my father's school in Barry...

08:48.283 --> 08:50.587
get married and settle down.

08:52.419 --> 08:57.791
And then, one day after a
long and comfortable life...

08:57.792 --> 08:59.678
I will wake up screaming.

09:00.477 --> 09:03.108
I've woken up screaming in Barry myself.

09:13.413 --> 09:17.481
I'm sure you've woken up most
people with your screaming in Barry.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.873
Everything takes time Mr. Jones.

09:56.248 --> 09:59.253
Why are you in such a hurry
to visit Moscow?

09:59.594 --> 10:02.963
I... I hear Moscow is beautiful
this time of year.

10:02.964 --> 10:05.048
Yes, much.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.458
And, you want a press card?

10:12.556 --> 10:13.552
What's this?

10:13.553 --> 10:14.664
My article.

10:14.665 --> 10:17.037
We really need a, a letter from an editor....

10:17.038 --> 10:20.488
a three page description of
what you will write about Russia,

10:20.595 --> 10:24.571
copies of all the articles you have written
and the address of your publisher.

10:24.572 --> 10:28.039
I don't have an editor
or a publisher. I'm a stringer.

10:28.507 --> 10:29.786
Freelance.

10:28.507 --> 10:30.977
Who will be paying for your keep?

10:31.560 --> 10:32.335
Myself.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.323
You are not a Journalist.
You want to be a Journalist.

10:42.782 --> 10:45.404
Ah..

10:45.686 --> 10:49.587
I... have interviewed Hitler...

10:50.418 --> 10:53.170
I plan to interview Stalin.

10:53.953 --> 10:56.612
You're funny Mr. Jones.

11:14.833 --> 11:18.937
Moscow 71795.

11:18.938 --> 11:22.664
Moscow 71795.

12:12.155 --> 12:13.285
Mr.Klebb?

12:13.852 --> 12:15.438
Yes?
- Telephone please.

12:15.439 --> 12:17.195
OK. Sorry.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.709
Paul! This is Gareth Jones. In London.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.787
Listen, I'm on my way to Moscow.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.018
Gareth, I've been trying to reach you.

12:29.019 --> 12:30.211
So you're coming here?

12:30.212 --> 12:34.791
Paul I need your help again,
this time arranging an interview with Stalin.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.163
Please, tell me you know a way.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.784
Go to Walter Duranty at the New York Times.

12:38.785 --> 12:40.117
He has influence I'm...

12:40.118 --> 12:43.217
Here, I am now persona non grata.

12:44.999 --> 12:48.686
Listen, I really need to talk to you,
I found something big.

12:48.687 --> 12:50.278
You can crack the story wide open.

12:50.279 --> 12:52.157
It's worse than we thought before.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.672
Paul?

12:55.897 --> 12:57.784
Paul?

13:20.525 --> 13:22.969
Your Visa application has been approved.

13:22.970 --> 13:27.248
And, we have made arrangements for you
to be boarded at the Metroplataz.

13:27.249 --> 13:28.889
The Metropol.

13:29.568 --> 13:37.544
I was going to find an old hotel near the train
station but this is much more preferable.

13:37.545 --> 13:40.962
You register with the
British Embassy when you arrive.

13:40.963 --> 13:43.666
And then you register
with the Soviet State Office.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.101
Failure to register forfeits your Visa.

13:47.102 --> 13:49.231
Is it understood Mr. Jones?

13:57.503 --> 14:01.908
I would love to see more of your
beautiful country other than just Moscow.

14:02.293 --> 14:05.339
Right after you interview Stalin.

14:06.155 --> 14:08.936
Good luck Mr. Jones.

15:01.733 --> 15:06.257
New building. There was a lovely room here.

15:06.258 --> 15:09.839
The Soviets have built more in five years
than our government can manage in ten.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.289
You ought to visit factories...
British engineers here...

15:15.290 --> 15:17.028
there's Vickers, you should talk to him.

15:17.029 --> 15:18.423
I'll do that.

15:17.656 --> 15:21.167
Where are they hosting you? In the Metropol?
- Yes.

15:21.207 --> 15:22.965
How are things in London?

15:23.849 --> 15:27.041
Lloyd George and MacDonald
solve the economic crises yet?

15:28.306 --> 15:30.597
They have their best minds on the case.

15:30.598 --> 15:34.577
Ah ha... and their best minds got us into this mess. Huh?

15:37.327 --> 15:41.655
What have you heard from the Kremlin about Hitler?

15:43.799 --> 15:46.376
Did Lloyd George tell you
to ask me that?

15:46.377 --> 15:48.950
Hmm? Hitler make him nervous?

15:49.655 --> 15:50.690
I'm afraid not.

15:54.015 --> 15:57.041
Forgive me, we're putting the papers

16:01.065 --> 16:02.870
I read your article.

16:04.306 --> 16:07.320
You think Hitler really believes the things he said?

16:07.067 --> 16:10.731
Lots of people say that he's deranged.

16:10.995 --> 16:12.855
What is deranged?

16:12.856 --> 16:15.252
In a deranged world, hmm?

16:15.253 --> 16:18.927
There's talk in London we're headed to war.

16:19.268 --> 16:21.596
Britain can't support another war.

16:21.696 --> 16:23.252
Can the Soviets?

16:23.670 --> 16:27.920
British engineers, new factories.
How is Stalin paying for it all?

16:27.921 --> 16:29.716
Money I suppose.

16:31.109 --> 16:33.468
They've not paid for it in Roubles.

16:33.469 --> 16:34.185
Mr. Duranty.

16:34.186 --> 16:37.206
You know how rich this country is. How vast.

16:37.912 --> 16:41.231
Out of nothing but wheat fields.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.283
Grain is Stalin’s gold.

16:45.909 --> 16:48.319
That's a lot of grain.

16:48.863 --> 16:51.221
In a five year plan, that's
more than double in their output.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.925
Why are you really here, Mr. Jones?

17:13.108 --> 17:17.727
I need your help arranging an interview with Stalin.

17:19.315 --> 17:20.209
Mmm.

17:21.657 --> 17:23.724
Are you 27, 28?

17:24.127 --> 17:25.565
Does it matter?

17:25.566 --> 17:29.964
Have you become so accustomed to
weekends in the country with Lloyd George that...

17:29.965 --> 17:33.249
you think you can take tea with just any head of state?

17:34.829 --> 17:38.633
I have no expectations.
I just have questions.

17:39.251 --> 17:41.961
The numbers just don't add up.
The Kremlin is broke, so...

17:41.962 --> 17:45.520
how are the Soviets suddenly on a spending spree?
Who is providing the finance?

17:47.412 --> 17:52.070
Forgive me. The fact that I have more
questions than answers for you makes me nervous.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.059
hmm.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.698
Who got you on the plane with Hitler?

18:01.597 --> 18:03.112
I had help.

18:04.568 --> 18:05.966
From a journalist.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.992
It was Paul Klebb who helped me get on Hitler's plane.

18:20.993 --> 18:23.618
He tipped me off where he would be and when.

18:30.020 --> 18:32.310
Actually I... I have to go, ahh...

18:32.311 --> 18:35.697
He's staying in the Metropol I'm...
hoping to catch him this evening.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.862
This is good. More of this.

18:43.096 --> 18:44.917
She's my star.

18:46.366 --> 18:47.871
I depend on her.

18:59.427 --> 19:01.067
Paul Klebb is dead.

19:03.241 --> 19:05.448
A robbery three days ago.

19:06.119 --> 19:07.504
You didn't know?

19:11.346 --> 19:12.502
No.

19:13.552 --> 19:14.436
Hmm.

19:19.498 --> 19:20.842
Did you know him well?

19:22.470 --> 19:25.065
We met in Berlin ah...

19:25.066 --> 19:28.619
He was a friend.

19:32.231 --> 19:33.939
Where did it.. where did it happen?

19:35.159 --> 19:37.342
Outside the Metropol.

19:40.531 --> 19:44.256
Having some people over this evening.
Journalists mostly. Care to join?

19:47.539 --> 19:51.240
Ahh.. yes, yes of course.

19:53.448 --> 19:54.876
Ahh thank you.

21:04.017 --> 21:05.246
Welcome.

21:06.610 --> 21:07.875
Mr. Jones?

21:15.261 --> 21:17.401
You are staying tonight.

21:17.752 --> 21:20.654
Ahh.. no, I'm here for one week.

21:21.276 --> 21:22.794
I was told tonight.

21:23.708 --> 21:28.851
My, my Visa is for one week, ah..
It says so on the stamp.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.860
We're full that many nights.

21:32.059 --> 21:34.741
Metropol is holding a conference.

21:37.708 --> 21:41.564
Ah.. do you know another hotel nearby?

21:41.799 --> 21:46.611
I'm afraid you're only authorised to stay here.
Only for tonight.

21:50.173 --> 21:52.924
Ah.. right then. Tonight.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.866
Hey, what's going down here?

22:25.033 --> 22:27.449
Oh, the hotel is on high alert.

22:28.324 --> 22:29.783
There was a robbery.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.116
Cushny's very worried.
There's top security round here.

22:34.408 --> 22:35.699
Where you from?

22:35.949 --> 22:36.991
Wales.

22:37.283 --> 22:38.783
Are you here for the Western Mail?

22:39.033 --> 22:40.491
Stringer.

22:40.949 --> 22:42.991
Eugene Lyons, United Press.

22:43.241 --> 22:44.324
Yes, I know.

22:44.491 --> 22:45.533
Gareth Jones.

22:45.699 --> 22:49.741
I enjoyed your articles on the
construction of the electrical grid.

22:49.949 --> 22:52.449
You must know Metro Vickers finest...

22:52.783 --> 22:56.991
- L.C. Thornton, John Cushny - How do you do.
- Hello.

22:57.408 --> 23:01.241
Is Metro Vickers holding a conference
in the hotel this week?

23:01.824 --> 23:02.908
No.

23:03.199 --> 23:04.616
Who gave you that idea?

23:04.824 --> 23:07.492
Come on, I look like I could use a drink!

23:07.784 --> 23:11.825
Why do you look so familiar?
Doesn't he look familiar, Lyons.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.034
You're that Welsh chappie that
interviewed Hitler!

23:15.284 --> 23:17.450
You're definitely coming with us.

23:17.617 --> 23:22.159
Everybody comes to Duranty's,
the best party's in Moscow.

23:29.919 --> 23:32.996
Oh hey, I see you guys have
got started without us...

23:32.997 --> 23:35.078
the party's already in full swing.

24:05.867 --> 24:11.492
He told me he was persona non grata
with the regime. Do you know why?

24:14.325 --> 24:16.450
Did you know what he was working on?

24:16.700 --> 24:19.200
There's not much else to do here is there?

24:19.450 --> 24:21.950
When you're not allowed to leave Moscow.

24:22.117 --> 24:25.575
And what kind of reporting
can you do confines you?

24:26.575 --> 24:30.409
Wait... journalists are confined to Moscow?

24:30.575 --> 24:32.325
For protection?

24:33.409 --> 24:35.034
Yeah, that's right!

24:35.492 --> 24:38.493
What are they... are they paranoid about spies?

24:39.535 --> 24:43.785
Have you ever read Edgar Alan Poe's
The Mask of the Red Death?

24:47.410 --> 24:51.118
The Mask of the Red Death.
Have you read it? - No.

24:51.535 --> 24:54.035
Get a copy before they ban it.

24:56.201 --> 24:57.910
Do you know...

24:58.826 --> 25:01.535
Do you know where the money is coming from?

25:01.868 --> 25:05.493
Duranty said grain is Stalin's gold.

25:05.701 --> 25:09.701
Grain is Stalin's gold?
Duranty actually said that?

25:10.701 --> 25:12.743
That's a hell of a line!

25:12.993 --> 25:17.410
Ask him why he never bothered to use it in print.
Muggeridge, Barnes, come over here!

25:17.576 --> 25:19.993
Lloyd George wants an interview!

25:20.243 --> 25:21.451
Malcolm Muggeridge.

25:21.618 --> 25:23.243
- Let's dance!
- Gareth Jones.

25:31.410 --> 25:33.701
Have you met Bonnie?

25:36.368 --> 25:38.201
So you inject it yourself?

25:38.700 --> 25:40.785
Just like a nurse would?

25:41.410 --> 25:43.493
You wanna try some?

25:44.160 --> 25:45.368
What's it like?

25:49.410 --> 25:50.993
It's like...

25:53.910 --> 25:55.785
being in the arms of God.

25:58.826 --> 26:01.535
"The Light Whose Name is Splendour.”

26:02.160 --> 26:03.576
What'd you say, honey?

26:03.826 --> 26:05.535
Oh, it's ah...

26:05.826 --> 26:08.035
It's an old Welsh poem.

26:08.244 --> 26:10.077
"Battle of the Trees”.

26:10.286 --> 26:11.494
Yes!

26:12.952 --> 26:14.786
It's like poetry!

26:20.744 --> 26:24.369
- Are you sure?
- No, no, I'm... thank you.

26:26.661 --> 26:28.286
Why don't you give it to me then.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.911
- O no, ah...
- You won't hurt me.

26:29.994 --> 26:34.202
- You just have to be gentle.
- O no, that's quite alright.

27:59.995 --> 28:01.787
Leaving so soon?

28:05.787 --> 28:07.370
Mr. Duranty...

28:08.745 --> 28:10.245
Mr. Jones...

28:11.412 --> 28:13.620
Did you enjoy yourself?

28:16.328 --> 28:20.495
I can honestly say that I've,
never seen anything quite like it.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.203
Is Bonnie alright, not quite to your taste?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.453
Pardon me?

28:26.620 --> 28:30.787
Perhaps, perhaps you would prefer... her?

28:33.912 --> 28:35.328
I came...

28:36.078 --> 28:37.912
Sorry, thank you.

28:39.578 --> 28:42.245
I came here to work, Mr. Duranty.

28:44.328 --> 28:46.120
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

28:47.745 --> 28:50.453
You can do whatever you like here.

28:54.495 --> 29:00.828
It's ah... curious, that the Kremlin
confines journalists to Moscow.

29:02.578 --> 29:04.078
Thank you.

29:06.203 --> 29:07.620
You don't drink.

29:07.870 --> 29:10.454
You don't appreciate the
gorgeous girls at my party,

29:10.954 --> 29:15.246
You are rather dull, Mr. Jones.

29:17.871 --> 29:20.496
There are other things in life,
I suppose.

29:21.579 --> 29:22.996
Such as?

29:25.028 --> 29:26.249
Well, ah...

29:27.246 --> 29:33.746
I'm standing opposite a completely naked Pulitzer Prize Winner.
My life can.. can't be the boring can it!

29:36.621 --> 29:38.996
Come here. I'm gonna show you..

29:41.663 --> 29:43.288
My son...

29:45.953 --> 29:48.246
refuses to learn English,

29:50.828 --> 29:52.538
proud Russian.

29:57.496 --> 29:58.913
Alright...

29:59.454 --> 30:03.079
Goodnight, Mr. Jones,
get home safely.

30:06.121 --> 30:08.329
Goodnight, Mr. Duranty.

30:19.913 --> 30:21.121
Hey.

30:21.829 --> 30:23.538
Were you at Duranty's?

30:23.871 --> 30:25.079
Yes.

30:26.454 --> 30:32.079
Do you mind running this upstairs and leaving this on his desk?
It's like the opium den up there isn't it.

30:35.078 --> 30:36.371
Hey!

30:37.038 --> 30:39.454
His office is third door to the left.

30:41.664 --> 30:45.455
- I couldn't help myself. I took a quick look at your article.
- Did you...?

30:45.705 --> 30:47.372
- But...
- Shh...

30:54.997 --> 30:56.497
Who is that?

30:57.164 --> 30:59.289
That's my 'big brother'.

31:02.122 --> 31:04.455
I thought it was well written.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.122
Thank you.

31:07.872 --> 31:12.164
I'm interested in your reporting on
Stalin’s new tanks and plane factories.

31:12.330 --> 31:16.372
It's the Americans.
Duranty's trying to lure them here.

31:16.789 --> 31:19.164
So Duranty's playing peacemaker?

31:19.414 --> 31:22.747
The Revolution won't succeed
without foreign investment.

31:23.039 --> 31:26.122
- The British Government is here.
- That's not enough.

31:26.289 --> 31:28.414
The Americans need to see
they can make money here.

31:28.789 --> 31:31.872
Washington's boycott
will finally be over.

31:32.622 --> 31:36.080
And the Revolution
will be well on its way again.

31:36.789 --> 31:39.247
What other choice do we have?

31:39.872 --> 31:43.205
I just didn't think that
Duranty had an agenda.

31:43.705 --> 31:47.872
Or that he was advising
the President of the United States.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.580
Did you know, Paul Klebb?

32:00.247 --> 32:02.205
Everyone knew Paul.

32:02.497 --> 32:05.747
Do you happen to know
what he was working on?

32:12.540 --> 32:15.331
Here's my door, goodnight.

32:15.581 --> 32:16.623
Ada!

32:16.831 --> 32:17.998
It's my first night.

32:18.331 --> 32:20.955
Care to join me in a bowl of borscht?

32:21.040 --> 32:21.874
No.

32:24.123 --> 32:25.665
Good luck in Moscow.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.081
Good morning.

32:45.623 --> 32:47.373
May I come in?

32:47.831 --> 32:49.623
I'm on deadline.

32:50.415 --> 32:52.623
What are you working on?

32:53.081 --> 32:54.956
I'm researching a story on

32:55.165 --> 32:58.373
agricultural output collectivisation
of former agrarian systems.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.748
That sounds fascinating!

33:00.331 --> 33:02.415
What are your sources?

33:15.373 --> 33:17.331
I don't have much time for...

33:17.748 --> 33:19.290
Is there something I can help you with?

33:21.873 --> 33:24.373
My sources tell me you're foreign affairs
advisor to Lloyd George.

33:24.498 --> 33:26.415
- Is that not the case anymore?
- I am.

33:28.748 --> 33:30.040
You've been checking up on me!

33:30.123 --> 33:33.080
Look. I really need to get back to my work.
I've got a thing about deadlines!

33:33.205 --> 33:34.790
What do you want?

33:35.915 --> 33:38.706
The story no-one is talking about.

33:39.456 --> 33:42.456
I can see for myself numbers,
they don't add up..

33:42.748 --> 33:44.832
There is a story here.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.916
I think, Paul was on to it.

34:06.832 --> 34:08.998
Don't say anything, just listen.

34:16.041 --> 34:19.831
Paul was working on a story that,
he was afraid to talk about.

34:20.456 --> 34:22.706
I spoke to Paul the day he was murdered.

34:22.956 --> 34:25.623
He sounded like he needed to talk.

34:25.998 --> 34:28.248
Do you have any idea what?

34:29.873 --> 34:31.831
He was so stubborn.

34:32.998 --> 34:34.831
Paul, the Apostle.

34:37.706 --> 34:38.916
I saw him.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.416
Before Bert sent him packing.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.291
(And then he got a bullet in him.)

34:46.916 --> 34:49.748
And you don't think it was a robbery.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.291
What was Paul working on?

34:55.416 --> 34:58.416
Come on tell me?
What was Paul working on?

35:02.499 --> 35:04.082
The Ukraine.

35:06.499 --> 35:08.207
Stalin's Gold...

35:12.832 --> 35:15.917
And journalists aren't allowed in Ukraine.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.583
That's where he was headed
the day he was shot.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.000
You're not Paul.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.667
Go home, Gareth.

36:51.043 --> 36:55.751
<i>Mr. Jones, my
former foreign advisor...</i>

37:28.543 --> 37:32.168
- Can I use your typewriter?
- Why?

37:32.793 --> 37:34.793
I left mine at home.

37:55.084 --> 37:56.626
You write poetry?

37:57.293 --> 38:01.834
- Do you always go where you're not wanted?
- Read me one of your poems!

38:04.084 --> 38:06.376
My mother used to read me poetry.

38:06.543 --> 38:08.501
Welsh poems mostly.

38:09.876 --> 38:12.459
"I know the light whose name is splendour,

38:12.626 --> 38:18.044
and the number of the ruling lights,
that scatter rays of fire high above the deep.”

38:19.919 --> 38:22.460
It's ah.. "Battle of the Trees”.

38:25.294 --> 38:26.294
You've got five minutes.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.710
I only need one.

38:36.169 --> 38:41.294
<i>Mr. Jones,
my valued, foreign advisor...</i>

39:12.044 --> 39:15.002
<i>I am going to Ukraine.</i>

39:36.335 --> 39:38.169
- Eat! Eat!
- Thank you.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.794
- Caviar?
- No, thank you.

39:41.085 --> 39:43.419
- Wine?
- I don't drink.

39:45.419 --> 39:47.961
Thank you for seeing me at such short notice.

39:48.211 --> 39:53.253
Nonsense! Lloyd George's foreign advisor
is Moscow’s honour to receive you!

39:53.795 --> 39:55.086
But...

39:55.545 --> 39:58.878
it is very odd,
if you don't mind me saying so,

39:59.461 --> 40:02.545
that you have requested a press visa,

40:02.920 --> 40:04.336
not a diplomatic one.

40:04.628 --> 40:08.545
Why would Lloyd George's foreign advisor
come to Moscow as a journalist?

40:11.128 --> 40:12.128
What, what's this?

40:12.295 --> 40:15.586
A letter of introduction from
my employer, Lloyd George.

40:17.753 --> 40:21.586
Relations between our two countries
has finally normalized.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.753
We have our best engineers here,
Metro Vickers helping you power your factories.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.253
I hope I can speak freely,
friend to friend.

40:27.420 --> 40:28.670
Sure.

40:32.045 --> 40:34.711
It was Lloyd George who
arranged that interview with Hitler,

40:34.878 --> 40:37.753
and it confirmed our worse fears.

40:38.273 --> 40:44.503
I ah.. I came as a journalist so as not to attract
attention from the Germans.

40:45.378 --> 40:53.545
There is... concern in London that... the Soviet Union
would not be able to defend itself should Hitler attack.

40:53.795 --> 40:55.045
Attack?

40:55.586 --> 40:58.670
You read the same papers we do.
You have your agents in Germany.

40:58.836 --> 41:01.795
They're all hearing the same thing, are they not?

41:02.003 --> 41:05.670
If we are to contain Hitler,
we must open two fronts.

41:07.253 --> 41:09.295
Can you hold the Eastern Front?

41:12.878 --> 41:14.378
Mr. Jones...

41:15.003 --> 41:17.586
Metro Vickers may be qualified
to build up our factories,

41:17.753 --> 41:22.129
but they are nothing compared to
the engineers, Soviet engineers.

41:22.754 --> 41:26.879
We have building new planes
and tanks in Kharkov.

41:27.046 --> 41:29.004
- Stalin...
- In Ukraine?

41:29.504 --> 41:31.087
- What?
- In Ukraine?

41:31.254 --> 41:33.462
Yes, Yes, in Ukraine.

41:38.212 --> 41:39.587
In fact!

41:41.504 --> 41:46.754
Mr. Jones, why don't you see for yourself!
I would be happy to arrange a trip for you,

41:47.379 --> 41:53.296
to see just how prepared we are..
for an attack from the Germans!

41:53.879 --> 41:55.629
or the British.

41:57.962 --> 42:00.171
Paul gave me this before he left.

42:00.337 --> 42:02.837
All the information is there,
where he was going.

42:04.254 --> 42:06.587
Wanted me to have it
in case he never made it back.

42:38.254 --> 42:40.004
Want some tea?

42:47.504 --> 42:49.630
How goes the agenda now?

42:52.547 --> 42:54.713
I don't have an agenda.

42:55.547 --> 42:58.213
Unless you call truth, an agenda.

42:58.463 --> 43:00.505
Yes, but whose truth?

43:01.588 --> 43:06.213
- The truth. There is only one kind.
- You're so naive.

43:06.630 --> 43:11.588
Journalism is the noblest profession,
you follow the facts, wherever it leads.

43:12.088 --> 43:13.338
You don't take sides.

43:16.130 --> 43:18.130
My father is in the Foreign Service.

43:18.297 --> 43:22.505
I grew up mostly in Berlin. There's no place
like it, the freedom of art and music and culture

43:22.672 --> 43:27.505
and Nazis destroying everything.
So quickly. And I'm afraid for...

43:29.713 --> 43:30.838
I'm...

43:31.088 --> 43:32.672
I'm afraid for my friends..

43:33.463 --> 43:36.713
They're arresting everyone in the Communist Party.
We have to succeed. We don't have a choice.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.880
You sound like you work for Stalin.

43:39.047 --> 43:42.880
I don't work for Stalin. I believe
in a movement that's bigger than one person.

43:43.213 --> 43:45.255
What if you're wrong?

43:46.213 --> 43:48.880
That's just not another option, is it?

43:49.922 --> 43:53.797
Look there are cycles of history
just like thee are cycles of nature.

43:54.130 --> 43:58.047
There's been nothing but war and depression,
and now... is a chance to rebuild...

43:58.213 --> 44:02.630
their fight for the future, a future for the people,
the weak, the workers - and that's what the Soviets are doing.

44:02.797 --> 44:07.297
Do you believe in the state that put
four bullets in your friend's back?

44:07.672 --> 44:08.922
No...

44:09.463 --> 44:12.755
I believe that this movement
is bigger than any of us.

44:12.922 --> 44:16.838
Paul Klebb was a human sacrifice...
Do you hear yourself?

44:44.631 --> 44:45.839
Tea?

44:53.006 --> 44:55.506
I'll go make us some more tea.

45:03.631 --> 45:07.381
The most magnificent
musical instrument ever invented.

45:07.589 --> 45:09.173
It's so odd.

45:11.839 --> 45:15.048
- Oh, wait...
- That's it...

45:15.756 --> 45:18.548
- And that's the song?
- Yes, that's the song, yeah.

45:18.714 --> 45:21.298
The only song I can play.

45:22.214 --> 45:25.381
My mother didn't bring much back
but this is what she....

45:25.548 --> 45:27.631
Did she teach English in Ukraine?

45:27.839 --> 45:31.339
- Stalino?
- It was Hughesovka back then.

45:32.506 --> 45:33.881
In fact...

45:34.714 --> 45:37.631
Klebb's map takes me,
to where she once lived.

45:37.798 --> 45:40.464
My mother died when I was eleven.

45:43.006 --> 45:44.631
In her sleep.

45:46.298 --> 45:48.631
I think she killed herself.

45:52.257 --> 45:56.632
- If you met my father, you'd understand why.
- Your father still stationed in Berlin?

45:56.840 --> 45:58.132
That town.

45:59.632 --> 46:01.840
That's where I met Paul.

46:06.590 --> 46:08.507
Come with me, Ada.

46:08.965 --> 46:11.382
Come and see where my mother lived.

46:11.632 --> 46:14.424
And find the fondness in your heart.

47:43.050 --> 47:44.050
Ada...

47:48.050 --> 47:49.425
No, don't go.

47:58.050 --> 47:59.591
No, just go.

48:02.175 --> 48:03.175
Go now.

48:57.801 --> 48:59.634
We're in Ukraine.

49:03.134 --> 49:04.384
Oh yeah.

49:05.176 --> 49:07.092
How did you know that?

49:08.259 --> 49:11.009
My mother spent some time here

51:14.010 --> 51:16.510
I ah... I just, ah...

53:06.344 --> 53:09.803
<i>There, comrade is the
answer to all our problems.</i>

53:10.011 --> 53:13.469
<i>It is summed up in a single word... man.</i>

53:16.553 --> 53:19.303
<i>Man is the only real enemy we have.</i>

53:20.386 --> 53:22.553
<i>Remove man from the scene,</i>

53:22.803 --> 53:27.012
<i>and the root cause of hunger,
and rule of work is abolished forever.</i>

01:20:38.238 --> 01:20:40.738
<i>Somehow it seemed as though
the farm had grown richer</i>

01:20:40.903 --> 01:20:43.572
<i>without making the animals themselves any richer -</i>

01:20:45.654 --> 01:20:49.072
<i>except of course... the pigs and dogs.</i>

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:51.904
<i>All animals are equal,</i>

01:20:54.654 --> 01:20:57.779
<i>but some animals are more equal than others.</i>

01:22:06.529 --> 01:22:07.904
- Six engineers.
- Six?

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:27.990
Are you aware that
London might see this as an act of war?

01:22:28.405 --> 01:22:30.655
- What about Washington!
- We don't want any questions.

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.365
What do you mean?! No questions?

01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:23.365
Mr. Cushny?

01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:02.116
Mr. Jones...

01:24:02.741 --> 01:24:07.449
I'm surprised, Lloyd George
would risk his foreign advisor.

01:24:08.824 --> 01:24:10.366
He didn't.

01:24:11.615 --> 01:24:12.824
No?

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:16.615
Are you saying,
we should release you?

01:24:17.324 --> 01:24:21.031
What about the engineers?
Should we release them too?

01:24:22.074 --> 01:24:23.824
This is what we'll do:

01:24:24.074 --> 01:24:28.574
We will send you back to Lloyd George,
but we will keep the other spies.

01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:33.574
And when Lloyd George's foreign advisor
returns to England and tells the truth

01:24:33.781 --> 01:24:35.531
about what he saw,

01:24:35.866 --> 01:24:38.074
your engineers will live.

01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:42.281
Mr. Jones...

01:24:44.491 --> 01:24:47.656
Did you enjoy your trip to the country-side?

01:24:57.366 --> 01:24:58.531
Good.

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:02.491
You saw the happy
and proud farmers?

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:06.699
The remarkable efficiency of
our collective farms?

01:25:09.031 --> 01:25:13.199
And any rumours of a famine, are
just that, simply rumours.

01:25:13.366 --> 01:25:15.116
What are they?

01:25:18.782 --> 01:25:20.575
- Rumours.
- And...?

01:25:24.532 --> 01:25:26.492
There is no famine.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.532
And repeat!

01:25:31.157 --> 01:25:33.657
There is no famine.

01:25:36.907 --> 01:25:37.907
Good.

01:25:39.992 --> 01:25:41.657
As you know...

01:25:42.117 --> 01:25:45.950
There are those that would
like to see, our revolution fail.

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:47.782
But we won't let that happen.

01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.407
Will we Mr. Jones?

01:25:53.075 --> 01:25:54.950
- No.
- I've arranged your passage home.

01:25:55.325 --> 01:25:57.492
We have your suitcase here for you.

01:26:43.575 --> 01:26:45.075
Mr. Jones...

01:26:47.701 --> 01:26:50.783
I'll have you know,
I convinced them to let you go.

01:26:52.826 --> 01:26:55.826
You don't deserve to be in a prison,
for your bravery.

01:26:55.993 --> 01:26:58.158
You knew, Mr. Duranty.

01:26:58.908 --> 01:27:00.408
You what?

01:27:04.493 --> 01:27:06.493
How much is Stalin paying you?

01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:12.868
What's keeping you here,
lying for them?

01:27:14.951 --> 01:27:21.618
You wouldn't know, the first thing about how
difficult it is to report for Moscow today, would you?

01:27:21.993 --> 01:27:25.576
Of course not,
you're just a child.

01:27:29.158 --> 01:27:33.826
It is not the job of a journalist to say:
"How dare you sir”.

01:27:36.033 --> 01:27:41.783
You actually thought, you could interview Stalin
and make some kind of difference didn't you?

01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:45.201
A souvenir from my trip.

01:27:45.993 --> 01:27:50.283
- Tree bark... It's all the people have left to eat.
- Alright...

01:27:53.076 --> 01:27:54.908
You can put it next to your Pulitzer.

01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:03.201
My dear Mr. Jones...

01:28:04.408 --> 01:28:07.326
There comes a time in every man's life,

01:28:07.618 --> 01:28:10.783
when he must choose a course...
greater than himself,

01:28:10.908 --> 01:28:14.493
than all his miserable little ambitions
put together.

01:28:14.826 --> 01:28:16.908
Perhaps someday you will.

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:20.119
It's a shame!
You would have made a fine journalist.

01:28:47.034 --> 01:28:50.784
Well, I guess now, the censors
are gonna be really busy!

01:28:51.577 --> 01:28:54.118
Just wait.... a few days.

01:28:58.994 --> 01:29:00.202
Ada!

01:29:59.703 --> 01:30:01.660
There he is. Jones!

01:30:05.995 --> 01:30:09.910
You look great. Good to see you!
I want you to meet my newest published author.

01:30:10.535 --> 01:30:12.745
- What do I call you now?
- Eric Blair.

01:30:12.953 --> 01:30:13.870
Gareth Jones.

01:30:14.035 --> 01:30:16.910
You won't find Blair on the bookshelf.

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.328
You have to look for "Orwell”.

01:30:19.495 --> 01:30:20.620
George Orwell.

01:30:20.785 --> 01:30:22.578
After the river.

01:30:26.328 --> 01:30:27.828
Thank you.

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:36.828
- I think Mr. Jones needs a drink.
- He doesn't drink.

01:30:39.078 --> 01:30:42.035
I think you're my only client, who doesn't.

01:30:42.244 --> 01:30:44.120
Then he might actually get some work done.

01:30:44.495 --> 01:30:46.245
One of us must.

01:30:47.578 --> 01:30:50.453
- We're not a charity Leonard.
- Nonsense!

01:30:51.035 --> 01:30:53.828
"Down and Out in Paris and London”
will be a sensation.

01:30:54.078 --> 01:30:57.285
Leonard tells me, you're working
on a book about the Soviet Union.

01:30:59.264 --> 01:31:04.120
Oh, I've... I've been using that line for some time I'm afraid.

01:31:11.535 --> 01:31:15.870
I... I do have a story...

01:31:17.535 --> 01:31:22.161
but if I tell it, six innocent men will die.

01:31:22.329 --> 01:31:24.911
- What men?
- The British engineers.

01:31:28.829 --> 01:31:32.036
But if I write the story,

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:35.371
millions of lives may be saved.

01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:37.954
I think, ah...

01:31:38.496 --> 01:31:40.286
you speak the truth.

01:31:40.454 --> 01:31:47.496
Regardless of the consequences it is...
your duty and... it is our right to... to hear you.

01:31:48.911 --> 01:31:50.161
It's just common sense isn't it?

01:31:50.411 --> 01:31:53.204
The six British citizens
whom I believe are innocent,

01:31:53.371 --> 01:31:55.871
are being held as
bargaining chips by Moscow.

01:31:56.286 --> 01:31:58.996
If we in the West, fold to this blackmail,

01:31:59.246 --> 01:32:03.286
we are, potentially allowing
unprecedented catastrophe.

01:32:06.579 --> 01:32:10.786
The Soviet Union is not the
worker's paradise that was promised.

01:32:11.871 --> 01:32:16.204
It is not the 'Great Experiment'
you read about in the press.

01:32:17.204 --> 01:32:20.871
Stalin has no stunning new achievement.

01:32:21.871 --> 01:32:27.454
Unless you consider, killing millions
of innocent people an achievement.

01:32:28.871 --> 01:32:30.661
Make no mistake.

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:35.746
If we let him get away
with this man made famine,

01:32:37.079 --> 01:32:39.246
there will be others like him...

01:32:43.996 --> 01:32:45.621
Thank you very much.

01:33:10.997 --> 01:33:12.705
Quite a story.

01:33:16.622 --> 01:33:19.287
Maybe The Soviets are
doing the best they can,

01:33:20.162 --> 01:33:22.497
making the best decisions they can...

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.122
given the circumstances.

01:33:26.497 --> 01:33:28.497
What about their free schools?

01:33:28.662 --> 01:33:30.662
Free hospitals?

01:33:31.787 --> 01:33:33.622
Yes, but at what cost?

01:33:36.455 --> 01:33:40.455
A more egalitarian study does exist,
it's just not perfect, we..

01:33:40.622 --> 01:33:43.580
We can't expect it to be,
experiments take time to gel.

01:33:43.747 --> 01:33:45.662
An egalitarian society...

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:50.662
It's the same system of
exploitation that exists here,

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.122
only it's worse.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.537
Unimaginably worse.

01:33:57.247 --> 01:33:59.455
- I know what I saw.
- Of course you do...

01:34:01.162 --> 01:34:03.747
Of course you do, but...

01:34:04.287 --> 01:34:07.205
But one has to put it in the proper context.

01:34:07.455 --> 01:34:08.662
Listen to me.

01:34:09.372 --> 01:34:12.162
Stalin is not the man, who you think he is.

01:34:18.622 --> 01:34:21.162
Are you saying, there's no hope?

01:34:38.373 --> 01:34:41.623
Why didn't the New York Times
break the famine story?

01:34:41.873 --> 01:34:48.623
Consider the source: Lloyd George's aid comes out with this
now in the middle of all this business with the British engineers.

01:34:49.373 --> 01:34:51.038
What are you hearing?

01:34:51.331 --> 01:34:54.498
It's all over-blown, hysteria.

01:34:55.998 --> 01:35:00.748
- What does London want. Another war?
- You'll get to the bottom of this?

01:35:01.038 --> 01:35:04.038
- Of course.
- We need it tomorrow.

01:35:31.373 --> 01:35:33.248
<i>Just as that moment,</i>

01:35:33.498 --> 01:35:34.956
<i>as though at a signal,</i>

01:35:35.248 --> 01:35:37.748
<i>all the sheep burst out,
in tremendous bleating,</i>

01:35:37.956 --> 01:35:40.956
<i>"Four legs good, two legs better!”</i>

01:35:42.123 --> 01:35:45.331
<i>Went on for five minutes without stopping.</i>

01:35:45.581 --> 01:35:48.081
<i>By the time the sheep has quieted down,</i>

01:35:48.331 --> 01:35:51.498
<i>the chance to utter any protest passed,</i>

01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:55.582
<i>for the pigs had marched
back into the farmhouse...</i>

01:35:59.539 --> 01:36:02.414
- Mr. Duranty's waiting for me.

01:36:30.789 --> 01:36:35.039
He knows, if you ever decide to leave,
they won't let you take them with you.

01:36:35.374 --> 01:36:38.207
They'll hold them here.
As ransom.

01:36:38.414 --> 01:36:41.789
Along with anything else,
The Kremlin has on you.

01:36:42.749 --> 01:36:45.207
I thought you wanted a raise.

01:36:48.874 --> 01:36:53.289
- What will you do when the offers come forward?
- There aren't going to be others.

01:36:55.207 --> 01:37:01.457
You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
What's being done here, will transform mankind.

01:37:02.124 --> 01:37:04.957
Darling, bring that chair, right here.

01:37:07.999 --> 01:37:09.039
Come on.

01:37:09.207 --> 01:37:13.539
Aren't you the least bit concerned,
what they'll do to Mr. Jones?

01:37:14.374 --> 01:37:16.082
They start believing him?

01:37:16.374 --> 01:37:19.457
Fetch that chair, bring it right over here.
Put it right down here.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:25.915
A bit closer.

01:37:37.833 --> 01:37:40.083
In all my time in Moscow...

01:37:41.958 --> 01:37:47.708
I have never heard a tale as
preposterous as that of Mr. Jones.

01:37:49.875 --> 01:37:52.375
Go on, type!

01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:11.625
Certainly, conditions are not ideal, in the Soviet Union,

01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:14.665
There are still great challenges,

01:38:15.708 --> 01:38:20.000
but Stalin continues his march
toward modernity.

01:38:22.208 --> 01:38:24.250
March towards modernity.

01:38:29.915 --> 01:38:31.915
You can protect him.

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.665
Right.

01:38:37.083 --> 01:38:40.750
An exaggeration, of the now notorious...

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.790
Gareth Jones, do not portray...

01:38:45.833 --> 01:38:50.083
the real modern Russia where Stalin is admired...

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:53.708
and loved.

01:38:58.501 --> 01:38:59.666
Signed:

01:38:59.834 --> 01:39:01.376
Ada Brooks.

01:39:21.666 --> 01:39:22.959
Yeah.

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:25.584
Your passage to the future.

01:39:28.876 --> 01:39:31.916
It's an old friend in New York, it's an editor.

01:39:35.501 --> 01:39:38.501
The only monsters they have, are bankers.

01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:13.251
You have a choice, Ada?

01:40:17.291 --> 01:40:19.084
Think of Paul.

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:36.960
I received an urgent phone call
this morning from Mr. Litvinov,

01:40:37.127 --> 01:40:39.627
Commissar for Foreign Affairs.

01:40:40.085 --> 01:40:45.210
He told me some disturbing things
about your unauthorised trip.

01:40:46.127 --> 01:40:47.792
I assured Mr. Litvinov,

01:40:48.252 --> 01:40:53.252
that you will retract your statement to the press,
and clear up this matter immediately.

01:40:53.417 --> 01:40:57.710
- Or they will shoot our engineers?
- That matter does not concern you.

01:40:57.877 --> 01:41:01.210
They are holding them hostage sir.
Blackmailing us from speaking out.

01:41:01.377 --> 01:41:06.252
- You broke serious laws in a foreign country!
- You wanted to know the truth as much as I did!

01:41:06.417 --> 01:41:10.252
You were released weeks ago from my employ.
You no longer work for me,

01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:13.917
or His Majesty's Government.
If you had any sense, you would do as I ask!

01:41:14.085 --> 01:41:18.877
Have you seen so many wars that the
murder of innocent people means nothing to you??

01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:24.085
How can I retract... the empty villages?

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:27.752
The orphaned children plagued by hunger?

01:41:27.917 --> 01:41:29.960
We can still do something sir....

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:31.627
- We can still help.
- Mr. Jones.

01:41:31.792 --> 01:41:36.210
- We cannot let Stalin get away with this!
- What do you expect me to do, exactly!?

01:41:36.377 --> 01:41:41.460
Break off all ties, when our economy
is already on its knees?

01:41:44.085 --> 01:41:46.167
You betrayed my trust,

01:41:47.585 --> 01:41:49.877
you betrayed your country.

01:41:50.585 --> 01:41:55.917
You will retract your statement publicly.
Without delay!

01:41:56.961 --> 01:41:59.043
You've gone too far.

01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:12.961
I... I will not be silenced sir.

01:42:18.586 --> 01:42:20.628
They're saying, you lied..

01:42:20.961 --> 01:42:22.253
They're all saying...

01:42:22.461 --> 01:42:25.586
<i>Diplomatic crisis has erupted between the East and the West.</i>

01:42:25.753 --> 01:42:29.961
<i>The latest accusation comes from
a young man by the name of Gareth Jones.</i>

01:42:30.128 --> 01:42:34.878
<i>It should be noted, that Mr. Jones is
the foreign advisor to David Lloyd George.</i>

01:42:35.043 --> 01:42:39.961
<i>The claim from Lloyd George's secretary,
is that a famine plagues The Soviet Union.</i>

01:42:40.128 --> 01:42:42.086
<i>I spoke to various experts myself,</i>

01:42:42.253 --> 01:42:46.211
<i>and can confirm, the conditions
remain difficult during the five year plan...</i>

01:42:46.336 --> 01:42:49.127
<i>- My god.
-... but my readers will be reassured:</i>

01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:52.253
<i>that the famine story,
is entirely false.</i>

01:42:52.418 --> 01:42:54.086
New York Times.

01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:58.418
Duranty debunks our dear Mr. Jones.

01:42:58.586 --> 01:43:02.128
It's a shame, he hasn't mentioned
he's Lloyd George's Secretary.

01:43:36.879 --> 01:43:38.212
Gareth.

01:44:06.587 --> 01:44:09.379
You were cleverer than all of us.

01:44:09.879 --> 01:44:12.212
Last place I thought you'd end up.

01:44:13.294 --> 01:44:15.044
Thought you'd be
Prime Minister by now.

01:44:15.212 --> 01:44:18.462
We've already had one Welsh Prime Minister this century.

01:44:18.794 --> 01:44:21.254
Mustn’t be greedy.

01:44:22.878 --> 01:44:25.379
I am happy to have you here, I am...

01:44:25.754 --> 01:44:29.044
Look I promised the publishers to keep you away
from foreign affairs and politics...

01:44:29.212 --> 01:44:31.419
But that does leave things like... culture.

01:44:31.587 --> 01:44:34.837
Bryn! Gareth Jones, remember him?
He's back! The legend returns!

01:44:35.004 --> 01:44:36.462
- Hold on, culture?
- Yes!

01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:40.212
Anything to help people to forget the terrible state we're in.
Morning.

01:44:40.879 --> 01:44:43.212
I've got you in with me. Hope that's ok?

01:44:43.544 --> 01:44:47.004
And we shall be as snug as...
Good morning! Good morning! Good morning!

01:44:51.462 --> 01:44:55.544
<i>This just in from Moscow:
The Soviet Union will release the remaining British Engineers and...</i>

01:44:57.212 --> 01:45:00.630
<i>- No, no.
- may be able to return home as early as next week.</i>

01:45:00.795 --> 01:45:04.255
<i>Kremlin officials in Washington today, have much to celebrate:</i>

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:07.755
<i>After a series of negotiations with the Whitehouse,</i>

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.380
<i>the United States has officially recognized The Soviet Union...</i>

01:45:16.588 --> 01:45:18.545
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:45:18.795 --> 01:45:23.963
<i>American business leaders have long welcomed this move,
as a way to expand trade.</i>

01:45:24.130 --> 01:45:28.796
<i>With the man credited for
convincing President Roosevelt, is Walter Duranty,</i>

01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:32.920
<i>better known to his readers as
"Our Man In Moscow".</i>

01:45:34.129 --> 01:45:37.213
<i>The creatures outside looked from pig to man,</i>

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:39.295
<i>and from man to pig,</i>

01:45:39.463 --> 01:45:41.463
<i>and from pig to man again;</i>

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:46.755
<i>but already, it was impossible to say, which was which.</i>

01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:10.088
That's Gareth Jones.

01:46:10.255 --> 01:46:11.920
The man whose mad.

01:46:21.795 --> 01:46:23.505
Run! Run!

01:47:00.256 --> 01:47:01.589
Gareth!

01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:04.256
Are you alright?

01:47:05.339 --> 01:47:08.796
Those church ladies
refusing to talk to you are they?

01:47:11.881 --> 01:47:13.296
No rush.

01:47:16.506 --> 01:47:19.756
You planning on
submitting your article soon?

01:47:21.921 --> 01:47:22.921
He's here!

01:47:23.671 --> 01:47:25.046
Blimey!

01:47:25.296 --> 01:47:26.631
Who's here?

01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:28.256
Hearst.

01:47:29.671 --> 01:47:31.296
William Randolph Hearst.

01:47:31.506 --> 01:47:34.171
He summers near ... St. Donats.

01:47:36.089 --> 01:47:38.546
You've been away a long time.

01:47:40.171 --> 01:47:41.214
Of course.

01:47:42.089 --> 01:47:45.381
Of course! Hearst bought St. Donats.

01:47:45.546 --> 01:47:46.671
Where do you think you're going?

01:47:46.839 --> 01:47:49.006
- I've got to talk to him.
- Not a word!

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.464
Gareth!

01:47:51.421 --> 01:47:52.506
Gareth wait!

01:47:52.756 --> 01:47:54.089
Gareth!

01:47:54.756 --> 01:47:56.421
Gareth, wait!

01:47:57.381 --> 01:47:59.214
Every summer we try
to get an interview with Hearst...

01:47:59.381 --> 01:48:02.047
and every summer we get denied.
Not this summer.

01:48:02.215 --> 01:48:06.132
I'm the assistant editor now!
I have to play my cards carefully, do you understand?

01:48:08.007 --> 01:48:09.007
Fine.

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:12.090
- I'll interview him.
- Are you mad?

01:48:13.965 --> 01:48:16.340
I can't have you going to St. Donats.

01:48:16.757 --> 01:48:19.340
You've gabled with your career.
You're not gambling with mine.

01:48:49.715 --> 01:48:50.922
Can I help you?

01:48:51.090 --> 01:48:52.757
I work for the Western Mail.

01:48:52.882 --> 01:48:54.922
Well, as you can see, we're rather busy.

01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:56.757
I just returned from Moscow...

01:48:56.922 --> 01:49:00.047
I have a story that will run
on the front of Mr. Hearst's newspapers.

01:49:00.297 --> 01:49:03.297
I suggest you talk to his newspapers then.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.672
Didn't you say,
you write for the Western Mail?

01:49:06.922 --> 01:49:10.632
Why would you give your story
to Mr. Hearst, a competitor?

01:49:10.965 --> 01:49:13.882
Mr. Hearst's papers
have more lawyers.

01:49:14.672 --> 01:49:16.507
I'm afraid you're trespassing.

01:49:16.757 --> 01:49:18.465
I must ask you to leave.

01:49:18.672 --> 01:49:21.340
If you'll just give me one minute, I...

01:49:22.922 --> 01:49:24.132
Thank you! Thank you!

01:49:24.297 --> 01:49:26.047
I have my bike.

01:49:59.091 --> 01:50:02.633
- I, I let myself in through the... kitchen..
- Eres!

01:50:02.798 --> 01:50:05.923
Mr. Hearst, believe me,
I have something you want to hear.

01:50:09.048 --> 01:50:10.173
Peter!

01:50:10.548 --> 01:50:14.716
I have a story of Pulitzer making
a terrible mistake Mr. Hearst.

01:50:14.798 --> 01:50:16.048
Let him be!

01:50:17.007 --> 01:50:18.298
You have thirty seconds.

01:50:18.841 --> 01:50:21.091
I just returned from Moscow.

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:25.132
I took a train south and saw empty village after empty village.

01:50:25.257 --> 01:50:29.173
- I have a famine story.
- I saw it with my own eyes, Mr. Hearst.

01:50:29.716 --> 01:50:36.173
The world has just lost one of its best reporters,
a man who I know you tried to hire.

01:50:38.383 --> 01:50:40.591
Chased Klebb for years...

01:50:42.466 --> 01:50:45.716
- Do you think, they killed him?
- You thought so too.

01:50:47.298 --> 01:50:48.423
Why did they want Paul dead?

01:50:48.716 --> 01:50:54.216
- The same reason they're discrediting me.
- You're certain it was the famine story got him killed?

01:50:54.633 --> 01:50:58.133
A journalist who worked with him confirmed it.

01:51:03.342 --> 01:51:06.384
Well, if I commission an article from you...

01:51:07.967 --> 01:51:13.549
it will be your word against Duranty's Pulitzer.

01:51:22.217 --> 01:51:23.424
Yes.

01:51:27.509 --> 01:51:29.842
Famine in The Soviet Union!

01:52:05.134 --> 01:52:08.342
<i>Dear Gareth,
I am home, in Berlin...</i>

01:52:10.217 --> 01:52:12.717
<i>How quickly things fall apart.</i>

01:52:17.092 --> 01:52:23.049
<i>I'm writing for Berliner Tageblatt again,
at the moment. Until they shut us down.</i>

01:52:23.592 --> 01:52:25.759
<i>I read your article.</i>

01:52:26.924 --> 01:52:28.799
<i>You were right:</i>

01:52:29.092 --> 01:52:31.424
<i>There is only one truth.</i>

01:52:34.175 --> 01:52:36.385
<i>Congratulations, Gareth.</i>

01:52:37.093 --> 01:52:39.343
<i>Paul would be so proud.</i>

01:52:42.050 --> 01:52:44.175
<i>Wherever you're off to next,</i>

01:52:44.593 --> 01:52:47.050
<i>make sure to pack a good bag.</i>

01:53:02.218 --> 01:53:03.260
<i>For days at a time,</i>

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:07.175
<i>the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangles.</i>

01:53:07.343 --> 01:53:10.550
<i>Starvation seems to stare them in the face.</i>

01:53:10.843 --> 01:53:15.300
<i>It was likely necessary to
conceal this fact from the outside world.</i>

01:53:16.218 --> 01:53:19.010
<i>Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill,</i>

01:53:19.175 --> 01:53:24.550
<i>the human beings were inventing fresh lies, about animal farm.</i>
