00:44.294 --> 00:45.659
Tina, baby.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.046
You are so beautiful.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.672
I know who you are.
You're with the demons.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.714
And I detest spies.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.143
Take her to the guesthouse!

01:58.327 --> 01:59.442
Enjoy your stay!

01:59.745 --> 02:01.110
Scumbag!

02:01.538 --> 02:03.028
Tuck her in, boys!

02:22.684 --> 02:24.925
Announcer: It's time for
what's cooking tonight?

02:25.103 --> 02:27.389
And here are your hosts,
Melbourne's favorite chefs,

02:27.564 --> 02:28.849
baggio and Jackie!

02:29.024 --> 02:30.889
Thank you. Thank you.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.026
Tonight we combine
the culinary arts

02:35.197 --> 02:37.404
of the east and the west.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.065
Ooh! Easy there, Jackie.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.742
Baggio: First, knead the dough.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.825
It's like giving your true love

02:45.999 --> 02:48.206
a sensuous massage.

02:48.627 --> 02:52.586
Then stretch the dough
and give it a twist.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.005
Crowd: Ohh!

02:56.176 --> 02:58.633
Ladies, if you want,
after the show,

02:58.804 --> 03:01.216
Jackie will do the same
to your hair.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.925
- Ah.
- Ohh.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.925
Baggio: Now pull the dough

03:07.104 --> 03:10.392
into fine spaghetti noodles.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.394
The alchemist works his magic,

03:13.527 --> 03:15.563
and before your very eyes,

03:15.737 --> 03:17.853
a lump of dough is transformed

03:18.031 --> 03:20.818
into delicious pasta!

04:06.455 --> 04:08.571
For this bitch you betray me?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.489
I1... 1 just...

04:10.667 --> 04:11.907
How much did they pay you?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.500
Nothing. I was drunk.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.332
I didn't know she was a demon.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.454
Some punk stole my coke

04:18.591 --> 04:20.673
because you couldn't
control yourself?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.960
I'll get it back. I swear.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.719
Oh! No!

04:28.226 --> 04:30.512
Boss, the demons are here!

04:48.288 --> 04:50.370
I hear you have something
that belongs to me.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.615
I don't think so!

04:53.919 --> 04:54.919
Slut.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.955
You set me up.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.423
Careful!

05:06.807 --> 05:09.765
I'm really good
at cutting things off.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.852
Excuse me.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.603
I thought we're here
to do some business.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.600
Put 'em away.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.940
Okay...

05:20.237 --> 05:22.068
Mr. Giancarlo,

05:22.280 --> 05:23.895
let's deal, huh?

05:28.620 --> 05:31.953
Here's half a million.
You give me back what's mine,

05:32.123 --> 05:34.580
I'll let you walk away,
no questions asked.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.787
Half a million, huh?

05:37.087 --> 05:38.452
How much do you want?

05:39.548 --> 05:40.663
Giancarlo: All of it.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.046
Ah-ah-ah...

05:45.220 --> 05:47.882
All of it, 10 million.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.094
What's the world coming to
when a businessman has to pay

05:52.269 --> 05:53.634
to buy back his own stuff?!

05:53.979 --> 05:56.846
Your stuff, huh?
Only stuff I got is mine!

05:57.148 --> 05:59.264
You want it? You pay the price.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.895
You call on me
when you're ready to deal.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.488
You bitch!

06:06.366 --> 06:07.366
Go to hell!

06:07.617 --> 06:08.617
You first!

06:32.684 --> 06:34.470
Demon: Come on.
Let's get out of here!

06:44.112 --> 06:45.352
Who the hell...

06:47.532 --> 06:48.532
Get them!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.244
Hurry up!

07:18.521 --> 07:19.931
Richard, hurry!

07:28.531 --> 07:29.236
Richard!

07:29.407 --> 07:30.407
Go!

07:32.118 --> 07:34.154
Thug: Get your ass...

07:35.497 --> 07:36.532
Out of my way.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.540
Go, go, go!

07:39.584 --> 07:41.290
- What's this?
- Girl and guy dropped it.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.122
- Where's the tape?
- The girl took it.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.627
Well, get her!

07:48.843 --> 07:50.049
Get her!

07:52.138 --> 07:53.719
- I want that tape!
- Right.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.471
And I want this place spotless.

07:55.850 --> 07:56.850
Let's go.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.392
Move aside!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.186
What the...

08:13.451 --> 08:15.066
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.135
Ah! Look out!

08:47.777 --> 08:49.187
Why are they after you?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.940
I don't know. I didn't do
anything to them.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.075
Thug: There she is!

09:01.249 --> 09:02.249
Oh.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.206
You ok?

09:04.711 --> 09:05.996
- Huh?
- Empty.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.002
Huh? Oh.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.300
Now it's empty!

09:22.187 --> 09:23.187
Oh!

09:59.099 --> 10:00.099
Go.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.552
Keep looking! Over there!

10:06.189 --> 10:07.189
Oh!

10:10.485 --> 10:11.485
What?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.031
Sorry.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.865
- Oh!
- Aah!

10:34.425 --> 10:35.425
Whoa. You're fast.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.383
- There they are!
- Let's go! Come on.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.517
Climb! Go up!

10:46.688 --> 10:47.688
Quick! Let's...

10:54.070 --> 10:55.901
- How'd you...
- Let's go, let's go.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.322
How did he do that?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.613
Why can't I get through?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.615
This time, you go your way,
I go my way, okay?

11:08.793 --> 11:09.793
Okay.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.649
Which way are you going?
= I'm going that way.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.708
Bye-bye!

11:24.601 --> 11:25.601
Hey!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.392
I don't even know her!

11:28.855 --> 11:29.935
You understand?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.395
Huh?

11:57.759 --> 11:59.169
Thank you, thank you.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.209
Ice cream!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.683
Please let me hide here.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.856
Shh.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.107
Shh.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.232
Go on, look around.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.527
Have you seen a Chinese guy?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.028
Yeah... me!

12:21.199 --> 12:23.281
Not you. Another Chinese guy.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.243
Ok. Right here!

12:27.413 --> 12:28.413
Hey...

12:29.332 --> 12:30.947
He's here!

12:35.046 --> 12:36.627
Why did you do that?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.638
I thought you were playing.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.878
Would you like some ice cream?

12:44.389 --> 12:45.720
I now pronounce you

12:45.890 --> 12:47.551

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

14:23.571 --> 14:24.936
Whoa! Hey!

14:41.547 --> 14:42.707
This way!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.396

15:02.026 --> 15:04.392
Don't worry. I know that guy.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.106
Sorry. Sorry.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.369

15:57.707 --> 15:59.072
Yes. How about you?

15:59.584 --> 16:02.121
I'm fine, but my poor car.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.077
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.711
Oh, it's ok.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.790
Thanks for coming to my rescue.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.625
You're welcome.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.515
By the way...

16:17.727 --> 16:18.727

16:20.855 --> 16:21.855
Jac...

16:22.315 --> 16:23.896
I know you.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.397
You do that cooking show.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.725
- Yes.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.732
You're a nice guy.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.029
Huh. I'm nice guy.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.617
Oh, be sure to watch me

16:36.787 --> 16:38.152

16:38.748 --> 16:40.739
Big story? I seen it.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.118
Bye!

16:42.376 --> 16:43.376
Bye!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.082
Man on machine:
It's Jeremy from channel 13.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.525
Well, where's your
exclusive? Call me.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.845
Woman on machine:
Hi, it's Annie at global.

17:16.868 --> 17:17.983
Heard you got a hot story.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.950
We can definitely do better
than those cheap bastards at 13.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.959
- Hi.
- Hi, lakeisha.

17:27.128 --> 17:27.959
- Grandpa!

17:28.130 --> 17:30.872
Hi, Sonny. Hi, Nancy.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.550

17:35.513 --> 17:36.513
How are you?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.092
I'm still kicking.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.922
Jackie: Open the door, please!

17:41.352 --> 17:42.011
Hi.

17:42.186 --> 17:42.891
Baggio: Hey, Jackie.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.062
Hi, everybody.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.265

17:45.439 --> 17:47.771
Hi, Sonny and Nancy. Whoo!

17:50.736 --> 17:52.692
Hey, Jackie,
you're looking sharp, man.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.521
Sharp? I'm lucky to be here.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.359
Why?

17:56.534 --> 17:57.534
I was shopping,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.103
and I was shot at
by the gangsters.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.245
Oh, my god.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.608
Jackie: They were
chasing a woman.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.495
They thought she was with me.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.533
Was anybody hurt?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.126
No. My poor car
is full of holes.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.580
Where'd this happen, downtown?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.292
- It did.
- Who was this woman?

18:12.466 --> 18:13.797
Her name's Diana.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.833
Oh, she said to watch
the big story tonight.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.343
You know,
I should take this down

18:17.513 --> 18:18.923
soi can file a report.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.514
Put that away. You're off duty.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.220
I don't want to talk
about it now.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.225
For this bitch you betray me?

18:28.774 --> 18:30.856
This is so cool!

18:31.485 --> 18:33.942
I wanna watch the cartoons.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.562
Hey!

18:36.741 --> 18:39.574
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Sonny's pushing me!

18:39.744 --> 18:44.534
Ah, come on! Be nice to
your little sister, don't fight.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.948
Come on, we'll go and watch
Jackie cook dinner.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.954
- Yeah!
- Yes?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.914
Announcer:
On what's cooking tonight

18:51.172 --> 18:52.503
oh, my god.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.544
Baggio: First, knead the dough.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.221
It's like giving your true love

19:02.391 --> 19:04.552
a sensuous massage.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.019
Then...

19:15.863 --> 19:16.863
Who is it?

19:17.823 --> 19:18.938
It's Richard.

19:30.961 --> 19:31.961
Richard?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.672
Sorry. I...

19:44.433 --> 19:47.015
Baggio: Now pull the dough
into fine spaghetti...

19:47.186 --> 19:49.302
Hold it. This ain't the tape.

19:51.982 --> 19:52.982
Where's the tape?

19:53.109 --> 19:54.109
I don't know.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.357
Maybe this will
refresh your memory.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.614
Wait! Wait.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.865
It's-it's with that guy.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.036
What guy?

20:05.496 --> 20:06.827
The guy who saved me.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.077
Let's go!

20:24.181 --> 20:25.762
Don't do that again, bitch!

20:32.064 --> 20:33.725
Don't try anything stupid.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.314
Whatever you say.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.111
Sorry.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.110
Sorry? You trying to
get a cheap thrill?

20:40.281 --> 20:40.940
What?

20:41.115 --> 20:42.426
Don't stand there
acting innocent.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.860
Did you get a good feel?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.695
Hey! That's ok. You can go.

20:46.537 --> 20:47.242
Move it.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.448
Don't push me!

20:48.998 --> 20:50.659
That guy's trying to cop a feel.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.916
Hurry it up!

20:51.959 --> 20:53.165
What's the hurry?

20:53.627 --> 20:54.627
You men are all the same.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.955
You can't wait, can you?

20:56.338 --> 20:58.420
Can't wait to see
what you've paid for.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.751
No worries, mate.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.260
Oh, what's this?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.843
A gun? Ooh! Kinky!

21:10.060 --> 21:11.266
Out of my way!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.278
Man: You idiot!

21:33.375 --> 21:34.535
Come on. Get up.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.425
Come on, this way.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.766
They've gone.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.893
- Where's the phone?
- Over there.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.742
Lakeisha: I can't wait to see
what's on the big story tonight.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.127
What do you think of
Jackie's new recipes?

22:24.593 --> 22:26.504
Mmm. Delicious.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.429
Hey, you never say that
about my cooking.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.675
Dad, I've been eating your
cooking for 30 years, okay?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.885
My marriage
only lasted five. Hmm?

22:36.272 --> 22:39.230
So you think in a marriage, food
is more important than love?

22:39.525 --> 22:40.935
Well, that's the way it is.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.977
If he had taken my advice
and become a chef,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.778
she wouldn't have left him.

22:49.118 --> 22:54.704
Grandpa, you always say
being a chef is the best.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.290
Yeah, and that being a cop
is too dangerous.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.577
And the kitchen is a safe place.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.789
That's right. That's why
Jackie's not a cop.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.260
That's true.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.259
Jackie's dad and I
were best friends.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.045
We owned a restaurant together.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.765
And before he died, I promised
I would take care of Jackie

23:14.935 --> 23:16.345
and keep him out of danger.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.145
So, as long as I'm around,
Jackie's going to be a chef,

23:20.316 --> 23:21.316
not a cop.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.932
Well, that's too bad
you and Jackie's dad

23:24.111 --> 23:25.521
didn't bother asking him.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.481
And it's too bad that my own son
doesn't listen to me

23:29.658 --> 23:31.273
the way Jackie does.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.989
I think I go get dessert.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.744
Dad? Can I be anything
I want to when I grow up?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.040
We'll talk about that
when you get older.

23:48.218 --> 23:48.877
Newscaster: Tomorrow,

23:49.053 --> 23:51.385
more sunshine and slightly
warmer temperatures.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.598
Strange. The big story
is not on tonight.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.425
So where's your mystery woman?

23:58.062 --> 23:58.801
I don't know.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.421
What are you doing
tomorrow morning?

24:00.689 --> 24:02.554
I'm taking a load
of videos to the show.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.515
Why, what do you want?

24:04.985 --> 24:06.441
Can you take me to the airport?

24:07.488 --> 24:08.488
Oh, come on.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.401
Okay. Have I ever
turned you down?

24:11.700 --> 24:12.700
Thank you.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.446
Sonny, Nancy!
Come on. We're going!

24:16.038 --> 24:17.653
Sonny, we're leaving! Come on!

24:22.211 --> 24:23.331
C'mon, Sonny! We're leaving!

24:35.808 --> 24:36.888
He's dead.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.386
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

24:41.647 --> 24:43.603
Oh, I'm gonna kill that bastard!

24:44.650 --> 24:46.686
He's gonna pay for this.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.437
Murdered grank,

24:51.615 --> 24:52.855
Tina's missing.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.523
Giancarlo, you're a dead man.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.614
I'll teach you
to screw with the demons.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.453
Mm-hmm.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.579
I'm gonna shove these
up Giancarlo's ass.

25:04.795 --> 25:05.875
I'm gonna kill them all!

25:06.046 --> 25:06.831
Shut up!

25:07.006 --> 25:08.462
Or you'll get us all killed.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.632
Bitch.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.085
Look at you.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.672
Who do you wanna kill,
me or Giancarlo?

25:14.722 --> 25:16.508
I want him dead,
we all want him dead.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.798
But we've gotta find a way
to get to him.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.549
Then we wait for
the right moment

25:20.728 --> 25:22.810
and then we kill the bastard!

25:28.569 --> 25:29.684
How long is she staying?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.021
I don't know.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.857
If she likes it,
she may stay longer.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.563
Are you going to marry her?

25:35.617 --> 25:36.617
Maybe.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.908
Well, do you love her?

25:39.288 --> 25:40.288
Of course.

25:40.789 --> 25:41.869
How do you feel about me?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.042
I like you.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.246
We've been together a long time.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.206
How come you never
asked me out on a date?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.172
We work together,
we eat together.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.502
That's enough.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.218
What's wrong with you?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.216
You know what's wrong.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.891
I do?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.053
Miki.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.976
- What?
- Jackie!

26:06.190 --> 26:07.190
Miki!

26:11.403 --> 26:14.315
This is my assistant, lakeisha.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.449
Nice to meet you.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.818
Hl there.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.033
You speak mandarin? Great!

26:20.704 --> 26:21.704
What'd you say?

26:21.747 --> 26:22.747
Huh?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.408
She only
speaks a little. Let's go.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.328
I'm so excited.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.630
Lakeisha on P.A.:
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:33.801 --> 26:35.632
please put your hands together

26:35.844 --> 26:38.551
for everyone's favorite
culinary cut-ups,

26:38.722 --> 26:41.555
baggio and Jackie!

26:45.437 --> 26:48.224
Welcome to the 10th annual

26:48.398 --> 26:51.140
"feed the hungry" benefit.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.230
Thank you for opening
your hearts...

26:54.822 --> 26:55.822
And your wallets...

26:58.117 --> 26:59.527
To help the needy.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.614
You eat today so that
they can eat tomorrow.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.073
Baggio: Mmm. Jackie,
I smell money out there.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.116
After the show, stop by

27:09.294 --> 27:11.580
and purchase your
personally autographed

27:11.755 --> 27:14.462
cooking with baggio
and Jackie video.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.249
And, of course,
all of our proceeds

27:17.427 --> 27:20.294
go directly
to "feed the hungry."

27:26.645 --> 27:27.645
Anybody hungry?

27:29.982 --> 27:30.982
You.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.683
Baggio: Sit. Relax.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.111
Open wide!

27:41.326 --> 27:42.862
Ah! Over here, Jackie.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.036
Here we go.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.621
It's really good!

27:52.754 --> 27:55.166
Ah, Jackie. Miki.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.714
Careful.
Don't get egg on your face.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.597
Ah. Up here, Jackie.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.480
Incoming!

28:22.784 --> 28:23.864
Me! Me!

28:40.135 --> 28:41.466
Uh, you want more?

28:57.653 --> 28:59.109
- Go, go, go.
- Huh?

28:59.571 --> 29:00.401
Trouble's coming.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.607
What? What trouble?

29:02.115 --> 29:03.776
Go. Quick. Go.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.818
Gentlemen,
please take your seat.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.075
You'll get your turn.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.329
Stop it!

29:11.500 --> 29:13.286
Call security.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.041
Quick, stop it.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.212
Call the police!

29:19.716 --> 29:20.876
Where's the tape?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.671
- What tape?
- The video!

29:24.388 --> 29:25.388
Oh, video?

29:25.514 --> 29:26.799
Over there, for sale.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.807
Oh, my god. What should we do?

29:30.978 --> 29:33.310
Call an ambulance.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.065
Uh, free!

29:44.074 --> 29:46.781
There are too many
innocent people down there.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.920
There he goes! After him!

30:11.518 --> 30:12.633
This way!

30:30.287 --> 30:31.823
Hurry! He's up there!

30:35.876 --> 30:37.537
Hey, move it!

30:58.106 --> 30:59.516
Look out!

30:59.691 --> 31:00.771
Move it!

31:08.158 --> 31:09.398
Hey!

31:25.425 --> 31:26.425
Hey!

31:26.927 --> 31:29.964
Whoa, whoa! Oh, no, whoa!

31:35.352 --> 31:36.512
Jackie!

31:43.944 --> 31:44.944
Oh!

32:11.430 --> 32:12.761
Excuse me!

32:19.729 --> 32:20.729
- Miki!
- Huh?

32:20.814 --> 32:21.929
Lift up!

32:25.777 --> 32:27.062
Oh! Look out!

32:27.237 --> 32:28.237
Hey!

32:30.198 --> 32:31.483
- Yaah!
- Oh!

32:38.498 --> 32:39.704
Hurry!

32:48.175 --> 32:49.735
They're catching up!

32:56.475 --> 32:57.675
Take this.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.757
Jackie, help!

34:38.451 --> 34:39.451
Miki!

35:37.636 --> 35:39.342
Jackie, help!

35:45.935 --> 35:46.935
Jackie: Miki!

36:13.213 --> 36:14.498
No!

37:06.850 --> 37:08.340
What do you want with that guy?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.634
Videotape.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.145
Wait!

37:54.939 --> 37:57.021
Thief! I'm gonna
split your skull.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.558
Wait. I can explain.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.560
You can explain it to the cops.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.238
I'm not a thief!

38:05.533 --> 38:07.444
I'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

38:07.869 --> 38:08.869
Uh-huh.

38:08.995 --> 38:10.110
I got it right here.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.739
It's okay
if your suitcase is lost.

38:26.763 --> 38:27.798
As long as you're okay.

38:30.183 --> 38:31.263
You're still shaking.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.163
I thought
we were going to die back there.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.427
Why are they so angry with you?

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
What did you do?

38:36.898 --> 38:38.498
I didn't do anything!

38:38.775 --> 38:40.561
It's just one big
misunderstanding.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.734
Diana: Enough, you psycho!

38:46.324 --> 38:48.610
Stop! Stop!
You're trashing my place!

38:48.952 --> 38:51.318
It's not my fault.
She's doing the trashing.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.407
And now I'm going
to trash your butt!

38:53.581 --> 38:54.581
Wait!

38:54.624 --> 38:56.034
Ow! Ow!

38:56.835 --> 38:57.835
Stop it!

38:59.504 --> 39:01.916
Look at my place!
How could you do this to me

39:02.090 --> 39:03.205
after I saved your life?

39:03.550 --> 39:04.915
I'm sorry.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.252
Look, I dropped a videotape
in your car yesterday,

39:08.429 --> 39:10.135
and I have to get it back.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.839
That must be the video
the gangsters wanted.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.829
You didn't give it
to them, did you?

39:14.853 --> 39:15.683
No!

39:15.854 --> 39:17.685
Good. Just give it to me.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.231
I don't have it.

39:19.399 --> 39:20.639
- What?
- What?

39:20.817 --> 39:22.682
You have to, because
when I got home,

39:22.861 --> 39:24.726
I had one of your stupid
cooking videos.

39:24.904 --> 39:25.984
Stupid?

39:27.282 --> 39:29.694
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.400
Please.

39:31.578 --> 39:33.364
I've got to have that tape.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.865
I'll do anything.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.371
I'll bet you will.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.249
What do you mean, do anything?

39:40.753 --> 39:42.273
Not what you think.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.420
If I had the tape,
I would give it to you.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.084
You should go to the police.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.337
I'd be happy to take her.

39:50.138 --> 39:50.877
Please just go.

39:51.055 --> 39:51.714
You don't understand...

39:51.890 --> 39:53.596
I understand. I know.

39:53.683 --> 39:54.763
My vase?

39:54.976 --> 39:56.386
Oh. Sorry.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.267
It's ok. I can fix it.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.269
Jackie, if you could
just help me.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.930
You're my last hope...

40:07.488 --> 40:09.729
This happens often?

40:10.366 --> 40:11.846
Only occasionally.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.949
Occasionally?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.807
She's gone out of our lives.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.106
They're coming.
They're gonna kill me.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.370
What?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.223
You're right.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.927
Is there another way out?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.101
Yes. Follow me.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.732
Jackie: Every time
I see you, trouble.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.568
This way.

40:50.823 --> 40:51.562
Lakeisha: Wait.

40:51.741 --> 40:52.741
Be careful.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.536
Diana: Wait.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.536
Wait for me.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.520
That's the way out?

41:03.169 --> 41:04.169
Yes.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.993
Don't worry.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.121
I'll go first.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.664
This is the other way out?

41:09.842 --> 41:11.082
Yeah. Are you scared?

41:11.260 --> 41:12.545
No.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.720
Sorry.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.930
- Go.
- Diana: I'll go. Ok.

41:43.793 --> 41:44.793
Shit!

41:47.797 --> 41:49.662
- Shit. Shit.
- Ow!

41:50.341 --> 41:52.798
- Ow. What?!
- Nothing, nothing.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.584
Okay.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.382
Shit, shit...

42:05.606 --> 42:07.142
- Need any help?
- No.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.690
- Okay. See you later.
- Okay.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.543
Hey.

42:34.302 --> 42:35.417
Why did you stop?

42:35.595 --> 42:37.085
I'm afraid of heights!

42:37.346 --> 42:40.759
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- I just found out!

42:41.893 --> 42:43.178
Come on!

42:44.479 --> 42:45.514
Listen.

42:46.314 --> 42:47.554
Look straight.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.347
Now what?

42:49.734 --> 42:50.734
Close your eyes.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.183
Now what?

42:52.779 --> 42:53.779
Ay-yow!

42:56.449 --> 42:57.859
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

42:58.034 --> 42:59.365
Well done!

43:03.748 --> 43:04.988
Hold still.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.702
Hey! That's the guy
that's got the tape.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.408
Come on.

43:50.586 --> 43:51.951
Miki!

43:52.505 --> 43:54.587
I can't believe
this is happening.

43:54.757 --> 43:58.170
Miki, are you okay?

44:03.182 --> 44:05.514
I'll arrange a safe house
for you all to stay in.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.683
You mean like a jail?

44:08.020 --> 44:09.020
No, thanks.

44:09.272 --> 44:11.058
Jackie, I know you can
take care of yourself,

44:11.232 --> 44:12.251
but what about the other 3?

44:12.275 --> 44:13.481
Hey, I'm sticking with Jackie

44:13.651 --> 44:15.391
until I get my tape back.

44:15.570 --> 44:16.980
Where are you going
to stay, Jackie?

44:17.613 --> 44:18.613
Anywhere...

44:18.698 --> 44:19.938
Like lakeisha's place.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.651
What? My place?

44:22.201 --> 44:23.361
Any problem with that?

44:23.536 --> 44:25.322
No, no. No problem.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.861
You know, you're all welcome.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.495
It'll be like a party.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.623
See? No problem.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.746
Jackie, be careful.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.418
Giancarlo: Well, gentlemen,
you asked for a meeting.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.633
We've lost a lot of business.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.799
There's no product to sell.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.305
How can I keep my men
if 1 can't pay them?

44:47.310 --> 44:49.551
People don't respect us anymore.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.600
The vietnamese are moving in
on our territory.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.399
Man: Damn it, Giancarlo,

44:54.525 --> 44:55.731
you've got to do something.

44:56.152 --> 44:57.983
Soon, we'll have nothing left.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.486
Gentlemen, thank you
for your concerns,

45:01.657 --> 45:05.024
but I assure you business
will continue as usual.

45:07.580 --> 45:08.580
You may go.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.921
Keeps his house so clean
you can't even fart.

45:32.605 --> 45:33.999
I'm sorry, boss.
We didn't get the tape,

45:34.023 --> 45:35.388
and 4 of our guys got blown up.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.566
What?

45:36.651 --> 45:38.061
Either I get the tape,

45:38.236 --> 45:39.942
or you'll never be seen again!

45:40.863 --> 45:43.400
Excuse me, boss.
There's a phone call for you.

45:46.911 --> 45:47.650
Yeah?

45:47.828 --> 45:49.681
I've got
your cocaine and the tape.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.934
3 P.M. tomorrow, at the golden
gardens construction site.

45:51.958 --> 45:52.958
Oh?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
The price is doubled.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.704
Thank you very much.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.011
Oh, let me do that.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.599
Oh, thank you.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.194
What did I do wrong?

46:25.950 --> 46:27.861
How did things get like this?

46:34.083 --> 46:35.869
I need to cheer up.
Don't let Jackie worry.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.706
Ah, yeah. Don't move.
Let me move.

46:41.382 --> 46:43.464
Yes, yes. Oh, that feels good.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.875
Ahh. Oh, yes. Ohh.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.009
Jackie.

46:56.814 --> 46:57.814
What is it?

46:58.357 --> 46:59.877
What are you doing?

47:00.943 --> 47:02.303
Washing dishes.

47:02.445 --> 47:04.231
I need to buy something.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.613
Now?

47:08.284 --> 47:11.617
It's been crazy since I landed.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.406
I lost my luggage.

47:13.998 --> 47:15.363
I need underwear.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.958
It's late.
All the shops are closed.

47:20.755 --> 47:21.835
What is she saying?

47:22.006 --> 47:24.713
Oh. She just wants
to buy some clothes.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.177
Not a problem.

47:30.348 --> 47:32.964
She's a bit smaller
than me, but, uh..

47:33.351 --> 47:35.592
Oh, I've got something that
should fit her just fine.

47:36.687 --> 47:37.392
She said...

47:37.563 --> 47:39.849
That I had small breasts.

47:42.777 --> 47:46.816
She didn't say you were small,
just that you have similar bodies.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.397
I heard her say "small".

47:50.076 --> 47:54.285
My english is poor, but
I understand the word "small".

47:54.455 --> 47:56.195
Hers are small, too.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.932
She did say "small"...

48:00.086 --> 48:01.872
But she didn't mean small.

48:03.672 --> 48:04.952
What are you guys talking about?

48:05.257 --> 48:06.257
Oh.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.670
Oh, she said, "thank you
for your generosity."

48:09.178 --> 48:10.759
Oh. Come with me.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.472
Don't be shy.

48:19.814 --> 48:20.599
Think.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.604
Did you go anywhere
else yesterday?

48:23.275 --> 48:24.515
No!

48:38.082 --> 48:41.415
Lakeisha and I are just friends.

48:42.503 --> 48:43.503
Don't be jealous.

48:43.921 --> 48:47.880
I'm not.
But you looked intimate...

48:48.050 --> 48:49.836
L.so I misunderstood.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.509
So should I be mean to her?

48:53.013 --> 48:55.629
Of course not.

49:00.771 --> 49:04.730
Traveling so far, I just
don't want to be disappointed.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.003
You definitely won't.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.088
Really?

49:08.112 --> 49:10.048
No problem.
The weather here is beautiful.

49:10.072 --> 49:10.811
What?

49:10.990 --> 49:12.509
Didn't you come with no clothes?

49:12.533 --> 49:14.148
Oh, stop.

49:38.726 --> 49:39.465
Who are you?

49:39.685 --> 49:40.765
Where's the tape?

49:40.936 --> 49:43.018
Oh, my god. You want
the tape, too?

49:43.397 --> 49:45.012
If you find it, please take it!

49:45.316 --> 49:46.351
Find it!

49:48.652 --> 49:50.563
Just don't hurt anyone.

50:07.254 --> 50:08.254
What happened?

50:10.549 --> 50:11.914
- Man: Cops!
- Huh?

50:13.260 --> 50:13.999
What's the matter with you?

50:14.178 --> 50:15.884
- Bathroom.
- Just hold it.

50:15.971 --> 50:16.971
Ok.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.299
Don't try anything funny now.

50:18.390 --> 50:19.846
I won't, I won't, I won't.

50:20.017 --> 50:20.847
Cops!

50:21.018 --> 50:22.303
Come on, let's go.

50:23.771 --> 50:24.510
Take her!

50:24.730 --> 50:26.345
Miki: Jackie! Jackie!

50:29.777 --> 50:31.688
The phone is gonna ring
in 12 hours.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.102
Be ready to trade.

50:59.139 --> 51:00.139
What happened?

51:00.349 --> 51:01.464
They took miki.

51:16.991 --> 51:19.232
All units, this is
captain Morrison.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.324
Don't anyone make a move
without my order.

51:23.747 --> 51:26.955
Listen up. Stay out of sight
until the hostage is safe.

51:27.376 --> 51:28.376
Ami clear?

51:35.593 --> 51:36.593
Hello?

51:37.720 --> 51:39.460
Trace that call.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.097
Where are you?

51:41.223 --> 51:43.339
I'm in Chinatown.
I'm ready to trade.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.386
Victoria market.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.271
Unit 4, go to Victoria market.

51:51.483 --> 51:52.814
Can you see Melbourne central?

51:53.485 --> 51:54.485
Yes I can.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.439
Morrison: C'mon.
He's on the move.

52:09.043 --> 52:10.374
There he is.

52:43.619 --> 52:45.951
Officer: This is unit 4.
We're at Victoria market.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.831
- Check that out.
- You got it.

52:53.128 --> 52:54.368
I'm at Melbourne central.

52:57.925 --> 52:58.925
St. kilda beach.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.299
You see the tram stop?

53:02.137 --> 53:03.798
Unit 1. St. kilda beach.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.095
Hop on the St. kilda beach tram.

53:16.735 --> 53:17.770
I'm on the tram.

53:17.945 --> 53:21.028
Any tricks, and we'll
kill your girlfriend.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.483
No, no, no. No tricks.

53:22.950 --> 53:23.950
Don't hurt her.

53:31.792 --> 53:32.792
Hello?

53:37.631 --> 53:38.962
Get off the tram now.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.706
What about St. kilda beach?

53:40.968 --> 53:42.378
Do as I say. Get off.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.509
Unit 2, exhibition centre. Copy?

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
Copy.

53:56.150 --> 53:57.640
They're playing with us.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.689
All units, focus in on Jackie.

54:02.656 --> 54:05.523
I warned you. I'm in charge.
Now back off.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.987
Can't you see?
They're running us around.

54:15.210 --> 54:17.246
All units focus in on Jackie.

54:47.242 --> 54:48.448
Remember...

54:48.619 --> 54:49.779
Behave yourself.

54:59.004 --> 55:00.335
Hey, watch it!

55:07.429 --> 55:09.420
Say hello to your boyfriend.

55:12.601 --> 55:14.717
Jackie! Jackie!

55:20.275 --> 55:21.435
Jackie!

55:21.902 --> 55:22.902
Miki.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.275
Take it easy.

55:29.618 --> 55:30.653
Hostage spotted...

55:30.828 --> 55:31.863
North side.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.744
All agents converge on Jackie.

55:35.749 --> 55:36.989
Not so close.

55:48.095 --> 55:49.676
Get back. You're too close.

55:59.481 --> 56:00.481
Cops.

56:00.983 --> 56:01.983
Damn.

56:02.526 --> 56:03.811
No! No! Jackie!

56:07.739 --> 56:08.854
Hey, stop it!

56:10.659 --> 56:11.865
Hey!

56:40.022 --> 56:41.478
Hey!

56:43.025 --> 56:44.231
Whoa!

56:53.035 --> 56:54.035
Here!

57:00.292 --> 57:02.328
Come on! - Jackie, help!

57:03.837 --> 57:04.576
Jackie!

57:04.630 --> 57:05.961
Help!

57:09.176 --> 57:10.507
Move it!

57:33.659 --> 57:34.865
Damn it!

57:39.539 --> 57:40.324
Where are they?

57:40.499 --> 57:41.614
It's over!

57:41.833 --> 57:43.289
Stop following me!

57:45.754 --> 57:46.754
Let's go.

57:54.596 --> 57:56.803
Jackie! Jackie, look,
I'm sorry, ok?

57:57.766 --> 57:59.302
You promised me she'd be safe.

57:59.518 --> 58:01.133
Damn, I didn't think
they'd be so smart.

58:01.353 --> 58:03.639
- No. You're stupid!
- Stupid?

58:04.272 --> 58:05.272
They saw your agents!

58:05.315 --> 58:06.315
What?

58:06.441 --> 58:07.441
Look.

58:08.068 --> 58:09.068
Look.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.111
Look.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.185
It's stupid!

58:12.364 --> 58:13.444
Those vests are regulation!

58:13.615 --> 58:15.401
I won't jeopardize
the safety of my men!

58:15.701 --> 58:17.532
Their safety? What about miki?

58:17.703 --> 58:19.739
I told you, but you
never listened to me!

58:20.288 --> 58:21.949
Damn you! How can I
get miki back?

58:22.124 --> 58:23.580
They were following my orders!

58:24.084 --> 58:25.884
- Your stupid orders!
- Jackie, cool down, ok?

58:25.919 --> 58:27.659
I promise we'll get miki back.

58:27.838 --> 58:30.500
I'll get her back.
You just stay out of my way.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.116
If you interfere
in police business,

58:32.300 --> 58:33.460
I'll have you arrested.

58:33.802 --> 58:34.917
Arrest me? Go ahead!

58:36.471 --> 58:37.711
Go ahead!

58:43.770 --> 58:44.770
Jackie.

58:44.896 --> 58:45.896
Jackie!

58:50.444 --> 58:52.059
Jackie, don't worry.

58:52.571 --> 58:54.778
They'll call.
They need that tape.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.563
What if they don't call?

59:00.787 --> 59:01.902
Yeah?

59:12.799 --> 59:13.799
You!

59:15.343 --> 59:16.343
Diana: Hey!

59:25.479 --> 59:26.889
Diana: Stop!

59:52.339 --> 59:53.954
What are you
looking at, fat boy?

59:58.970 --> 59:59.970
Somebody need help?

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.219
Yeah, you!

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.177
What happened?

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.765
Huh? I'm too nosy.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.306
- Are you all right?
- No!

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.693
Wait. I don't care
what you do to me,

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:21.867
just let her go!

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.619
Let's keep him until we're sure
this is the right tape.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.003
It's the right tape. Let her go.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.001
If you're jerking us around,

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.420
you and your girlfriend
are in trouble.

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.418
I'm gonna check the tape.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.547
And if it's not
the right tape, you're dead!

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:48.391
Matt, take the tape.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.660
Not my business.
Not my business.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.674
Watch the knife.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.629
Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.441
Where's my girlfriend?

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.916
Where is she?

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.547
Say it!

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.795
At the golden gardens
construction site.

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:51.618
Jackie.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:52.655
Let me go!

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.989
Tell me what happened!

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.953
Just let me go!

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.418
Let him go.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.292
Let him go!

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.264
I'm innocent. I
didn't do nothing.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:20.099
Police brutality.
You're all my witnesses.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:22.013
Hit me. Go ahead. Go on, hit me.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.807
My pleasure.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:30.863
Did you see that? He hit me!

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.616
- He hit me!
- And your mother too!

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.613
Diana: Oh, there's Jackie.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.243
Stop. Stop!

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.200
Clean up this mess.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.130
You two stay here.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:56.308
- Wait.
- 1 think that...

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.845
What... what we...

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.104
Don't touch me.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.941
Touch her again...

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:17.902
And I cut "em off.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.737
Where's my girlfriend?!

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:08.711
Wait! You demon!

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.757
Giancarlo's men! Run!

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.413
Quick! Over here!

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:50.976
You're a pretty one.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.449
Where's my cocaine?

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:07.030
You'll have to speak up.
I can't hear you.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.918
I used it to powder my nose.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:16.252
Hah! Let me see if
I can communicate

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.587
a little more effectively, then.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.716
Where's the tape?
And where's my cocaine?

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.380
I don't have the tape!

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:27.350
No tape? Well, then,
where's my cocaine?

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.683
No! Stop!

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.108
What happens to us
if 1 tell you?

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.737
You're free to go.

01:08:47.206 --> 01:08:49.287
Oh, you have my word.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.411
The two crates...

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.493
In that room.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.482
We found it!

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:14.899
All of it.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.062
She's all yours, boys.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.524
Go! Save yourself!

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:26.703
Run!

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:49.267
What happened?

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.433
The girl, she got away.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:52.844
Who cares?

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.887
Boss, the Chinese cook,

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:56.396
he's upstairs.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.979
The Chinese cook?

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.113
So who are you?

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.194
I-1-I'm miki.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.614
Jackie's my boyfriend.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.820
Oh, Jackie.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.534
Well, how about that?

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:15.037
I must be living right.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.169
Take her!

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.250
Put that in the car.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:29.505
Stand over there.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.265
You're gonna get us killed.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.223
Lakeisha, you're
my star witness.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.152
I'll get help.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.067
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.989
Don't hit me! Don't!

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:22.983
That way!

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:25.478
Grab one!

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.742
Jackie!

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.046
- Jackie!
- Jackie!

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.287
Throw her over.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:48.587
- No!
- No!

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.998
No! Don't!

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.167
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:54.669
You heard the man. He said no.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:55.882
Put her down.

01:13:57.808 --> 01:13:58.808
Jackie.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.470
Finally we meet.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.511
Try not to get
any dirt on my car.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.274
Go!

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:16.983
Hey!

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:17.991
Daddy!

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.242
My dear, hmm?

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:20.236
Hey, Sonny!

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:21.529
Daddy!

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:23.697
Hey, what's so
interesting on TV?

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.095
What's the world coming to
when a businessman

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.619
has to pay to buy back
his own stuff?!

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:30.462
Your stuff, huh?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.965
Hey, hey, hey. Where'd
you get the tape?

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:35.676
At grandpa's house.
Uncle Jackie brought it.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.477
Hello, this is Romeo.

01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:49.356
What? How bad are they hurt?

01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.112
I'm on my way.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.291
What happened?

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.659
Jackie and the two girls were
captured by Giancarlo.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:11.212
Now, if you wanna save
them, you'd better hurry.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:14.335
Thanks.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.562
Romedo.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:35.854
Remember. It's my exclusive.

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.658
This is all the information
we have on Giancarlo.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.668
Great. Thanks. I owe you one.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.250
Yeah, I won't forget.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.059
I can't even sit?

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:12.432
Look at you.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.851
The boss is very meticulous
about his home.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:16.519
Hand over the tape.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:18.066
I don't have it!

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:19.532
Hey!

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:25.869
Leave him alone.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.584
It's at my friend's.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.748
So? Call him.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.691
Come on, Romeo.
Answer the phone.

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:01.818
Where are you?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.536
Hl. It's Jackie.

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.579
Remember the tape I gave you?

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:15.786
You ever seen it? Good.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.213
Can you bring it to me?

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.215
Address?

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:22.387
What's the address?

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.712
Anybody knows the address?

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.015
They won't tell me.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.055
I'll come get it. Yes.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.807
See you later.
Don't go anywhere.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.147
I'll be there soon. Okay.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.062
He found the tape.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:40.102
But I have to go get it, okay?

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.649
See you soon.

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:52.991
Jackie!

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:55.167
Jackie!

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.329
Giancarlo:
Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.838
No! Stop!

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.546
Miki!

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.099
You like to play games?

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:20.278
Fine.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.611
Let's play one of mine.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.367
The judge is looking
at the tape right now.

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.952
You're too emotionally involved.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.451
We're really close to
breaking this wide open.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.867
I don't want a loose Cannon
jeopardizing the case.

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.794
So I'm here to make sure
there are no more screw-ups.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.501
Now, I want you to cool down.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.095
Mm-hmm.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.606
Well, here's your chance.

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:05.021
Show me what you got.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.657
Aw, real sweet punch.

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:10.234
Almost got me.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.223
What am I paying you idiots for?

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.263
He almost got me that time!

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.227
Don't mind the ropes.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.693
Take your best shot.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:06.507
Don't spit in my house.

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.909
No, no, no, no, no! Don't pull!

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.996
No, no, no, no, no. Pull! Pull!

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:51.335
Miki: Jackie!

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.515
Useless!

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:58.394
Idiot!

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.063
- Boss!
- What?

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.308
Luigi and the others,
they're here.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:06.767
Forget the damn tape.

01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.435
Take him to the guesthouse!

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.688
- Out of the way!
- Yes, boss.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.067
Luigi.

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.373
They might as well
give us condoms.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:55.365
Take the girls over there.

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.026
I'll look after this one.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:13.209
Lakeisha: Look out!

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:28.981
Get in! Get in! Get in!

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.355
Quick, quick, quickly!

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.787
Jackie!

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.631
Get out!

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:47.700
Remember, stay cool.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:52.044
What do you want?

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.161
We want to see Giancarlo.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.001
Well, maybe he doesn't
want to see you.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.007
Giancarlo: Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:02.044
That kind of rudeness
simply will not be tolerated.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.676
You wish to see me?

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.599
Captain Morrison, nea.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:10.264
This is Romeo baggio.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:11.686
Where's Jackie?

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:14.727
If you've done anything to him...

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.647
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:21.313
- Is your name Jackie?
- No.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:22.947
- You Jackie?
- No.

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:24.574
- You? You?
- No!

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:28.699
I know you.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:30.614
You're the city's
biggest drug lords.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.708
Well, what exactly
are you gonna do about it?

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:36.412
You have any evidence? No?

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:38.257
Then you can leave.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:40.757
Jackie! Jackie!

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.423
Hold it! Hold it!

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.339
I told you to cool it!

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.469
You know the law.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.264
I could shoot you
like a dog for trespassing.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.191
Relax.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:25:59.893
Let's get out of here.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.070
Come on. Let's go.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:06.780
Can you believe those two?
That romeoqo's got big brass ones.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.278
Or he'll find them hung
on his Christmas tree.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:18.662
What's that doing here?

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:31.216
Hey! It's Jackie!

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:32.851
Yeah, I know it's Jackie.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:34.647
He's okay.

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:42.715
Jackie.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.425
Giancarlo.

01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:06.655
Hey!

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:09.651
Do something!

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:08.770
All right, Jackie!

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:09.982
Who?

01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.481
Sorry, captain.

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:14.775
Who is that guy, anyway?

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.692
Did you see anything?

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:21.316
No, captain,
I didn't see anything.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:22.860
Right.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:25.320
You, uh, boys see anything?

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:26.742
All: No, sir.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:45.261
Captain, we got the evidence to
put Giancarlo away for good.

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:47.725
Take him away.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.933
Jackie, we got here
as soon as we could.

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:57.527
- Really, we did.
- Yeah, right.

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:58.857
Honest!

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.742
Shut up. I'm lucky to be here.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:14.749
I was shopping, and I was
shot by the gangsters.

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:16.208
Lakeisha: Oh, my god!

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:21.004
Who's the dialogue?

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:21.884
You.

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:23.340
My dialogue?

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:27.882
Aah!

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:32.895
Now I'm nervous.

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:37.392
When I speak english,
I'm nervous!

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:38.570
Aah!

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:42.189
Shut up. I'm...

01:33:42.408 --> 01:33:43.773
Aah!

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:47.618
Shut up. I'm lucky to be here.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:48.995
What do you smile for?

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.913
Just happy, ah.

01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:52.324
Ok.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:07.975
Ah!
