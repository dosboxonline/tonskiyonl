02:11.523 --> 02:12.721
Where are they?

02:16.315 --> 02:19.513
They're probably just running late.
They'll be here.

02:22.856 --> 02:24.231
I see them!

02:26.398 --> 02:27.429
Daddy!

02:32.731 --> 02:34.440
How are you, sweetie?

02:34.648 --> 02:36.138
Good to see you.

02:39.815 --> 02:41.471
- Hi there.
- How are you?

02:44.690 --> 02:46.648
- He's cute. Great!
- Thanks.

02:48.023 --> 02:48.856
We got to go.

02:49.315 --> 02:51.981
- We should go.
- I have my number.

02:52.981 --> 02:56.846
I won't be in Chicago for a few days.
I'm going to the Cape...

02:57.106 --> 03:00.023
Same B & B as last year?
I have the number.

03:01.231 --> 03:02.471
Say bye to your mom.

03:02.731 --> 03:04.138
- Give me a kiss.
- Bye, Mom.

03:04.398 --> 03:05.856
I love you.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.096
Call me. Anytime.

03:11.356 --> 03:13.065
- Bye.
- Love you.

03:23.398 --> 03:24.721
Bye, Mom.

04:04.648 --> 04:06.721
Sorry to be so late, ladies.

04:10.106 --> 04:13.523
FinanciaI consultant.
Recently divorced.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.803
Did you notice the way
he ate his pancakes?

04:21.231 --> 04:23.273
He took his time on every bite.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.596
Get a grip.

04:25.856 --> 04:29.898
You know what they say about
tall, lanky men, don't you?

04:30.190 --> 04:31.565
They have enormous feet.

04:32.856 --> 04:33.856
Morning.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.888
I happen to know he's going
to the theater today, a matinee.

04:38.356 --> 04:40.315
I think I'll take the harbor tour.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.596
"Dear Catherine:

06:04.856 --> 06:07.690
I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
in so long.

06:08.065 --> 06:10.190
I feel I've been lost...

06:10.440 --> 06:13.138
...no bearings, no compass.

06:13.398 --> 06:17.440
I kept crashing into things, a little
crazy, I guess.

06:18.773 --> 06:21.523
I've never been lost before.

06:21.856 --> 06:24.013
You were my true north.

06:25.315 --> 06:28.929
I could always steer for home
when you were my home.

06:29.565 --> 06:32.929
Forgive me for being so angry
when you left.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.856
I still think
some mistake's been made...

06:36.106 --> 06:38.856
...and I'm waiting for God
to take it back.

06:42.523 --> 06:44.481
But I'm doing better now.

06:44.731 --> 06:46.606
The work helps me.

06:47.731 --> 06:50.481
Most of all, you help me.

06:51.856 --> 06:54.856
You came into my dream last night
with that smile...

06:55.106 --> 06:57.481
...that always held me
like a lover...

06:57.731 --> 06:59.888
...rocked me like a child.

07:01.898 --> 07:03.971
All I remember from the dream...

07:04.231 --> 07:06.054
...is a feeling of peace.

07:12.106 --> 07:13.815
I woke up with that feeling...

07:14.065 --> 07:17.179
...and tried to keep it alive
as long as I could.

07:17.898 --> 07:21.804
I'm writing to tell you that
I'm on a journey toward that peace.

07:22.565 --> 07:26.179
And to tell you I'm sorry
about so many things.

07:28.065 --> 07:31.148
I'm sorry I didn't take
better care of you...

07:31.398 --> 07:35.606
...so you never spent a minute
being cold or scared or sick. "

07:41.398 --> 07:43.971
"I'm sorry I didn't
try harder to find the words...

07:44.231 --> 07:45.971
...to tell you what I was feeling.

07:46.231 --> 07:48.471
I'm sorry I never fixed
the screen door.

07:48.731 --> 07:49.971
I fixed it now.

07:50.231 --> 07:52.106
I'm sorry I ever fought with you.

07:54.773 --> 07:57.148
I'm sorry I didn't apologize more.

07:57.398 --> 07:58.856
I was too proud.

07:59.106 --> 08:01.565
I'm sorry I didn't
bring you more compliments...

08:01.815 --> 08:05.096
...on everything you wore and
every way you fixed your hair.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.929
I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you
with so much strength...

08:08.190 --> 08:10.481
...that even God
couldn't pull you away. "

08:10.731 --> 08:12.721
Signed, "All my love, G. "

08:14.773 --> 08:16.346
That is so sad.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.846
It's not that. It's just...

08:19.606 --> 08:20.440
...so honest.

08:21.273 --> 08:24.273
This could be hundreds of years old.

08:24.523 --> 08:26.429
It's typed, Alva.

08:31.565 --> 08:32.596
Pretty good.

08:32.856 --> 08:34.596
Meaning you wish you'd written it.

08:34.856 --> 08:36.815
I'd have e-mailed her.

08:37.190 --> 08:39.096
Anyway, I know what you wish.

08:39.356 --> 08:41.763
You wish it had been addressed
"Dear Theresa. "

08:42.856 --> 08:44.929
Come on now, Charlie...

08:45.190 --> 08:47.971
...any girI would want
to be loved like that.

08:48.231 --> 08:50.523
To be somebody's "true north"?

08:50.773 --> 08:52.263
Are you kidding?

08:54.231 --> 08:55.971
Lonely women, particularly?

08:56.231 --> 08:57.690
Is that how you see me?

08:57.940 --> 09:00.804
Did you talk to anybody on your trip?
Tell any jokes?

09:01.856 --> 09:02.971
I had a good time.

09:03.231 --> 09:04.315
Really?

09:04.565 --> 09:05.596
Came back a day early.

09:07.023 --> 09:08.846
I happen to like my job.

09:09.523 --> 09:12.190
You're in deniaI.
You should be writing.

09:12.898 --> 09:14.971
You better hope I stick to research.

09:15.231 --> 09:16.888
I don't think you can
do your column without me.

09:17.231 --> 09:21.804
Ever notice that most people here refer
to me as Mr. Toschi, out of respect?

09:22.065 --> 09:24.440
I knew you before
your teeth were capped.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.929
I knew you when your step was swift
and your heart was high.

09:29.190 --> 09:33.315
Al Giddons, "Lakefront Winter. "
Harcourt-Brace, 1948.

09:34.398 --> 09:36.023
Thought I made that up.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.888
Hey, Jase! How are you?

10:02.273 --> 10:04.065
Hi, Lina.

10:04.356 --> 10:06.148
No, sorry.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.690
I just was expecting him to call.

10:09.856 --> 10:12.721
No, I'm not worried. I just miss him.

10:12.981 --> 10:14.554
I know.

10:16.648 --> 10:17.763
What?

10:19.356 --> 10:21.513
No, I just got it. Why?

10:25.023 --> 10:26.054
What?

10:32.273 --> 10:34.429
I can't believe he did this.

10:34.648 --> 10:36.304
I can't believe it!

10:36.606 --> 10:39.554
- Why are you so annoyed?
- It's wrong to print it.

10:39.815 --> 10:43.565
It's private.
It's somebody's intimate thoughts.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.596
It's not your letter!

10:45.856 --> 10:48.638
I know it's not my letter.
I found it.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.356
Is this personaI?
Is that why you're pissed off?

10:51.856 --> 10:54.523
I'm not pissed off! I'm just...

10:55.481 --> 10:57.356
...a little pissed off.

11:19.481 --> 11:22.648
You had your chance
at the Christmas party.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.356
Morning, doll.

11:27.481 --> 11:28.481
Look at this.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.596
Letters to the paper about
the message in the bottle.

11:32.856 --> 11:33.721
What?

11:33.981 --> 11:36.356
And two more boxes.
Take those to research.

11:36.606 --> 11:39.096
I found him in the mailroom.
Nice ass.

11:39.356 --> 11:41.429
Charlie wants us to drop everything.

11:41.690 --> 11:43.429
And do what?
Answer all of them?

11:43.690 --> 11:46.096
Go through them and
count the pros and cons.

11:46.356 --> 11:47.763
Get rid of the nutso letters.

11:48.023 --> 11:51.690
Then we'll do excerpts. The paper
wants us to milk it. This is big.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.815
Bigger than
the low-fat muffin scandaI.

11:54.065 --> 11:56.106
Bigger than
the mayor and the teacher.

11:56.356 --> 11:57.731
It's amazing.

11:58.606 --> 12:00.481
"Your column sucks the big one. "

12:00.940 --> 12:02.106
- Negative, I think.
- Listen.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.815
"If only more men would have
the sensitivity...

12:05.065 --> 12:07.638
...to talk about how they feeI,
instead of...

12:07.898 --> 12:09.971
...hiding behind
the Sports ChanneI-"

12:10.231 --> 12:12.440
"My niece sent it to me.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.815
It might be from the same person.

12:15.065 --> 12:17.106
So I'm enclosing it here. "

12:19.315 --> 12:20.148
What?

12:21.731 --> 12:22.898
What?

12:24.023 --> 12:25.023
"Dear Catherine. "

12:25.481 --> 12:27.971
No. Are you kidding? Really?

12:28.231 --> 12:30.304
Out loud. Read it out loud.

12:33.231 --> 12:36.898
"Dear Catherine:
There isn't an hour without you in it.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.179
I mend the boats, test them...

12:39.440 --> 12:42.690
...and all the while
the memories come in like the tide.

12:43.981 --> 12:46.054
I thought today
of when we were young...

12:46.315 --> 12:49.096
...and you left our world
for a bigger world.

12:49.356 --> 12:52.356
I was a lot more scared
than I would admit.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.388
I fought my fear...

12:54.648 --> 12:57.398
...by telling myself
you'd come back someday...

12:57.648 --> 13:01.596
...and trying to think of the first
thing I'd say when I saw you again.

13:01.856 --> 13:05.054
I must have tried out
100 possibilities.

13:05.648 --> 13:07.638
What did I finally say?

13:07.898 --> 13:09.096
Not much.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.606
My mouth wouldn't work,
except to kiss you.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.815
When you said, 'I'm here to stay'...

13:16.065 --> 13:17.773
...that said it all.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.388
Well, I'm doing it again.

13:22.856 --> 13:26.304
I keep imagining what I'd say to you
if somehow you came back. "

13:27.815 --> 13:30.429
Bob. It's Theresa at the Tribune.

13:30.898 --> 13:32.773
I know, it's been a while.

13:33.023 --> 13:34.679
I've got something for you.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.138
It's two traces.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.263
A sheet of stationery
has an imprint on it.

13:39.523 --> 13:41.981
Also,
where do I go for a typewriter trace?

13:42.315 --> 13:43.940
The typewriter you're looking for...

13:44.190 --> 13:46.721
...is an Olympic Herzfogen 980.

13:47.023 --> 13:48.648
German. And old.

13:48.898 --> 13:51.648
Would it have been sold commercially...

13:51.898 --> 13:53.606
...in the last 30 years?

13:53.856 --> 13:55.481
Well, it's been re-keyed.

13:55.731 --> 13:59.096
People who like manuals
buy these reconditioned.

13:59.356 --> 14:02.690
This letter was probably typed
within the last 5 years.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.398
So he's out there.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.315
And he could be young.

14:06.898 --> 14:07.763
You'll like this.

14:08.023 --> 14:10.513
Remember the report I did?
Cork came back.

14:10.773 --> 14:13.856
It's been in the water
approximately two years.

14:14.106 --> 14:15.648
That's it? Two years?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.356
Thank you.

14:18.648 --> 14:19.679
Don't look at me.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.179
Aqua glass.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.471
Eighty-nine...

14:22.773 --> 14:24.648
...looks like an "A. "

14:25.231 --> 14:26.773
I'm sending you Polaroids.

14:37.648 --> 14:39.388
That sounds great.

14:40.231 --> 14:42.221
You like the baby, then?

14:43.440 --> 14:44.846
You're always so busy.

14:45.106 --> 14:47.481
I never get a chance to talk to you.

14:48.023 --> 14:49.596
- Hang up!
- Hang on one second.

14:50.481 --> 14:54.471
Remember the message
on the restaurant wall in Virginia?

14:54.731 --> 14:56.971
The stationery, the logo
and the typewriter are there.

14:57.231 --> 15:00.096
Hit line five.
She's waiting for you.

15:00.356 --> 15:02.888
- I never get to talk to him.
- Call him back.

15:03.315 --> 15:04.346
Can she fax it?

15:04.606 --> 15:07.304
Fax it? It's Virginia.
Ellie's House of Crabs.

15:07.565 --> 15:09.304
How do I know if
she has a fax machine?

15:09.565 --> 15:10.846
Have her fax it.

15:11.523 --> 15:12.721
Fine.

15:14.190 --> 15:16.940
Right. Tell me about Bunker Hill.

15:23.815 --> 15:25.971
"To all the ships at sea
and all the ports of call.

15:26.231 --> 15:29.731
To my family and to all
friends and strangers. "

15:29.981 --> 15:31.940
- No "Dear Catherine"?
- Not this time.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.315
The stationery
and typewriter check out.

15:34.565 --> 15:38.398
We think maybe this is
the first one or the finaI one.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.606
"This is a message and a prayer.

15:41.856 --> 15:44.856
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

15:45.106 --> 15:47.971
I already had what
everyone is searching for...

15:48.231 --> 15:49.940
...and few ever find:

15:50.190 --> 15:53.388
The one person in the world
who I was born to love forever.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.773
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

15:56.065 --> 15:57.606
...and the blue Atlantic mystery. "

15:57.856 --> 15:59.596
Outer Banks.
That's North Carolina.

15:59.940 --> 16:02.856
Right. But it's about a dozen towns.

16:03.106 --> 16:06.471
Only four support a boat-building
and restoring company.

16:06.731 --> 16:07.648
Then we got him.

16:07.898 --> 16:10.929
We've got stringers there,
and a sister paper in Wilmington.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.888
I bet we find this guy
before the week's out.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.096
Any bets, girls?

16:19.690 --> 16:20.606
What?

16:20.856 --> 16:21.690
I want to go.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.263
She wants to do it.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.346
You find this guy, then what?

16:25.606 --> 16:28.096
I don't know. I'm not sure.
But I want to go.

16:28.398 --> 16:30.856
Can't spare you. Need you here.

16:32.356 --> 16:36.763
You're the one that sent me to India
for the column on smokestacks.

16:37.023 --> 16:40.273
You sent her to Texas for 3 days,
talking to Marines.

16:40.523 --> 16:41.846
That was different.

16:42.106 --> 16:44.096
Why do you have to
do this personally?

16:44.356 --> 16:46.481
What do you mean?
I'm intrigued, so what?

16:46.731 --> 16:47.596
Intrigued?

16:47.856 --> 16:49.679
What if he's covered in tattoos...

16:49.940 --> 16:52.013
...and has four serious convictions?

16:52.565 --> 16:53.565
Tell her.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.148
I'm only afraid that...

16:57.398 --> 16:59.523
...your expectations are too high.

16:59.773 --> 17:01.981
I don't have any. This is research.

17:02.523 --> 17:06.137
You're thinking Heathcliff.
You're thinking Hamlet.

17:06.397 --> 17:08.721
This guy is probably Captain Ahab.

17:09.272 --> 17:11.397
Are you saying that I can't go?

17:14.731 --> 17:16.772
It's called a risk, Charlie, right?

17:17.022 --> 17:19.481
Something you've been
telling me for two years.

17:19.731 --> 17:21.272
"Take a risk. "

17:21.522 --> 17:22.981
Remember when you asked
me to call...

17:23.231 --> 17:25.981
...all the stationery stores
in the Outer Banks area?

17:26.231 --> 17:29.346
- I've got other names for you.
- I got it.

17:29.606 --> 17:31.648
What? You got what?

17:31.898 --> 17:33.471
I called one in Morehead City.

17:33.731 --> 17:36.106
They remembered
the little sailboat logo.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.856
They said it was designed
by the customers.

17:41.690 --> 17:42.690
It's them.

17:43.231 --> 17:44.346
Don't tell Charlie.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.846
He'll try and make you
do this over the phone.

17:47.106 --> 17:48.388
You got him, Theresa.

17:49.023 --> 17:51.013
Now go knock on his door.

19:18.981 --> 19:19.846
Ma'am?

19:22.981 --> 19:24.440
Can I help you?

19:26.565 --> 19:30.179
Sorry, I just admire these
older homes.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.929
You're in reaI estate?

19:33.773 --> 19:34.606
No.

19:37.106 --> 19:39.721
Could I take
a photograph of the house...

19:39.981 --> 19:40.898
...for a publication?

19:41.148 --> 19:42.523
Jehovah's Witness?

19:44.481 --> 19:46.888
Photograph.
Well, I never thought of that.

19:48.023 --> 19:49.648
Can't say yes or no.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.179
And why's that?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.763
That's my son's place.

19:54.231 --> 19:55.888
I live back down...

19:56.148 --> 19:57.179
...thataway.

19:57.523 --> 19:59.648
So you're going to have to ask him.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.096
He'll be kicking around the harbor.
Garret Blake.

20:04.106 --> 20:05.648
Never wears a hat.

20:06.398 --> 20:08.440
Great. Thank you.

20:09.523 --> 20:10.804
Is it Playboy?

20:12.648 --> 20:14.304
I always admired your covers.

20:14.690 --> 20:16.513
Never bought the magazine, though.

20:20.398 --> 20:22.304
Well, there's always tomorrow.

20:53.523 --> 20:54.440
Great day, isn't it?

20:54.690 --> 20:56.898
It's a beauty.
Wish I was out on the water.

20:57.148 --> 20:58.523
Yeah, I bet.

21:02.190 --> 21:03.763
Great boat.
Are you restoring it?

21:04.023 --> 21:05.679
Yeah, doing the best I can.

21:07.898 --> 21:09.888
Do you restore boats for a living?

21:10.148 --> 21:12.440
No, I'm just a weekend warrior.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.148
You got a boat that
needs some work done?

21:15.398 --> 21:16.231
Actually-

21:16.481 --> 21:19.981
I got a man here in town.
He's got a shop.

21:21.231 --> 21:22.888
He's working on the schooner there.

21:23.106 --> 21:25.971
The 40-footer.
Sweet lines on that boat.

21:26.231 --> 21:28.138
You can't beat the old woodies.

21:28.356 --> 21:29.190
Great, thank you.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.679
- You bet. You have a nice day.
- You too.

21:58.898 --> 22:02.315
I love the older, the wooden boats.

22:02.773 --> 22:06.304
It must be a 40-footer?
A schooner, right?

22:06.565 --> 22:08.106
It's an Alden Schooner.

22:09.106 --> 22:11.481
1922, out of Maine.

22:14.648 --> 22:15.513
Is she yours?

22:17.398 --> 22:18.398
Nope.

22:18.731 --> 22:20.940
Just putting her back in shape.

22:22.565 --> 22:23.429
Sweet lines.

22:27.898 --> 22:29.471
You want to step aboard?

22:32.773 --> 22:35.304
There's some wet spots.

22:47.231 --> 22:48.263
She's a beauty.

22:50.398 --> 22:51.773
Was she in bad shape?

22:52.481 --> 22:53.565
Neglected.

22:54.106 --> 22:54.940
Unappreciated.

22:56.481 --> 22:57.513
I know how she feels.

22:59.231 --> 23:00.065
Doubt it.

23:03.106 --> 23:03.940
You a tourist?

23:04.440 --> 23:07.388
I'm just getting acquainted
with the place, the people.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.679
I'm Theresa...

23:10.940 --> 23:11.856
...Osborne.

23:13.773 --> 23:14.721
Garret Blake.

23:15.356 --> 23:17.346
You sound like up north.

23:17.731 --> 23:18.929
Do I?

23:19.815 --> 23:20.763
Chicago.

23:21.023 --> 23:22.138
I'm in research.

23:23.898 --> 23:24.929
On what?

23:26.690 --> 23:29.388
Just about everything.
For a newspaper.

23:30.856 --> 23:34.471
Is there anywhere I can do
some sailing while I'm here?

23:35.023 --> 23:37.065
You could rent
a boat on the other side.

23:37.315 --> 23:40.013
Oh, no, I mean,
I'm not experienced...

23:40.273 --> 23:41.138
...at all.

23:42.190 --> 23:44.148
I'd like to be. I just...

23:44.856 --> 23:47.315
I'm from the Prairie State, so...

23:49.648 --> 23:51.690
I'm a dodo in the water.

23:55.690 --> 23:58.690
Sorry to have interrupted your work.
Thank you.

24:02.731 --> 24:04.971
I'm taking her out tomorrow morning.

24:05.231 --> 24:08.013
Test saiI.
Round the point and back.

24:08.523 --> 24:09.763
Just about an hour.

24:11.273 --> 24:12.648
Do you want to come along?

24:15.898 --> 24:17.013
That'd be nice.

24:17.273 --> 24:18.648
About seven.

24:18.898 --> 24:19.929
Great!

24:21.356 --> 24:23.065
If you come earlier...

24:23.315 --> 24:24.888
...I'll be in that diner over there.

24:25.148 --> 24:26.554
Earlier than seven?

24:28.065 --> 24:30.304
Great. I'll see you here.

24:31.356 --> 24:32.523
Or at the...

24:32.773 --> 24:33.690
...at the diner.

25:06.273 --> 25:08.971
- Hi, Chet. How you doing?
- All righty.

25:09.190 --> 25:13.981
Jesus, Chet! You always have
the same people in here every day.

25:16.773 --> 25:19.263
All the tourists go
to the Pancake Palace.

25:19.523 --> 25:20.929
Let them!

25:22.815 --> 25:25.679
And what do you got?
The same fishermen.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.304
A would-be carpenter.

25:27.648 --> 25:30.398
And a nearsighted mechanic.

25:30.648 --> 25:33.221
And a thief who wants
to be a shipwright.

25:34.481 --> 25:36.471
Now don't start any shit, Johnny.

25:36.731 --> 25:40.565
A thief is somebody who keeps
property belongs to somebody else.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.606
Am I right?

25:41.856 --> 25:45.440
You ain't right if the courts say
you ain't right, right?

25:46.731 --> 25:48.013
Loudmouth asshole.

25:48.565 --> 25:49.596
What'd you say?

25:51.398 --> 25:53.773
How'd you know I was talking
to you, Johnny?

25:54.481 --> 25:56.773
I'm calling Pete right now.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.638
You two bust up this place again
and charges will be pressed...

26:00.898 --> 26:03.190
...arrests will be made,
and I ain't bluffing!

26:03.606 --> 26:06.721
Man who's a thief
deserves to be in jaiI.

26:07.690 --> 26:10.888
I never took a damn thing from you
or anybody in this town.

26:11.148 --> 26:14.013
- I say different.
- You're a liar, Johnny.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.596
Don't ever call me a liar!

26:15.856 --> 26:17.846
Come on, grab hold of him!

26:24.815 --> 26:26.471
Will you guys get ahold of them?

26:26.731 --> 26:27.929
Will you separate them?

26:30.398 --> 26:32.273
Garret, come here.
Now get off him.

26:33.106 --> 26:33.940
Get over here!

26:38.023 --> 26:39.138
Now leave it alone.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.106
Just walk away for once.

26:42.565 --> 26:43.940
He ain't worth it.

26:45.648 --> 26:46.513
Go on.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.606
Didn't you see what he-?

26:50.565 --> 26:51.648
Come on, easy.

26:51.898 --> 26:53.304
- Settle down, John.
- Go ahead, Garret.

26:53.565 --> 26:55.638
- He ain't worth it.
- Let me go!

26:56.190 --> 26:57.273
It's all over.

27:23.856 --> 27:25.429
Thought you wouldn't come.

27:26.315 --> 27:28.638
I came to say I'm not coming.

27:31.106 --> 27:34.106
I didn't want to not show,
because I hate people like that.

27:35.023 --> 27:36.763
I'm sorry you saw that.

27:37.565 --> 27:38.679
Does that happen a lot here?

27:38.940 --> 27:41.346
I mean, instead of bowling or...

27:46.981 --> 27:48.523
Maybe I'll see you around.

27:48.773 --> 27:51.148
I'm still going to
run her out for a test.

27:53.690 --> 27:55.148
Just a short saiI.

27:55.690 --> 27:58.523
I don't know, you know.
What if you got mad at me?

27:59.065 --> 28:00.554
It's a small boat.

28:01.106 --> 28:03.429
I don't like fighting, Theresa.

28:04.856 --> 28:05.856
Bowling, either.

28:08.731 --> 28:10.356
Before you go, would you...

28:10.606 --> 28:12.731
...untie that, toss it in?

28:14.065 --> 28:15.096
Appreciate it.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.273
Thanks.

28:57.356 --> 28:58.763
Where am I not in your way?

28:59.648 --> 29:01.138
I'll get around you.

29:13.398 --> 29:15.356
Should I just jump over?

29:16.565 --> 29:18.054
I'm sorry, I...

29:19.231 --> 29:21.304
...I used to be better with people.

29:23.398 --> 29:25.023
So you used to be charming?

29:27.023 --> 29:28.565
Sorry I missed that.

29:54.648 --> 29:56.523
Who is that man in the diner?

29:58.273 --> 29:59.648
It's an old thing.

30:00.356 --> 30:02.315
I don't want to pry.

30:02.731 --> 30:04.054
How old?

30:08.440 --> 30:11.221
So this is what you do?
Research?

30:13.065 --> 30:15.440
No, actually,
it's called conversation.

30:17.773 --> 30:20.346
I might be able to help you.
I have a degree.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.429
So you stole his girlfriend
in the eighth grade?

30:27.190 --> 30:28.304
No.

30:29.606 --> 30:31.013
I married his sister.

30:34.523 --> 30:35.721
So, your turn.

30:35.981 --> 30:36.846
Right?

30:38.940 --> 30:40.398
Still married?

30:43.231 --> 30:44.096
You?

30:46.773 --> 30:47.888
I have a son.

30:48.898 --> 30:50.065
A great son.

30:51.731 --> 30:52.565
Date much?

30:55.398 --> 30:56.231
You?

30:58.356 --> 31:00.013
You're getting the hang of this.

31:00.398 --> 31:01.773
Watch your head with the boom.

31:45.398 --> 31:47.440
Do you hear from your mama?

31:49.440 --> 31:50.846
Got a letter.

31:52.273 --> 31:53.731
Still doesn't like you.

31:56.190 --> 31:57.731
No fooling.

32:05.273 --> 32:07.804
Looks a little small for you.

32:08.273 --> 32:09.388
What?

32:09.898 --> 32:10.815
The jacket.

32:11.106 --> 32:12.273
What jack-

32:15.106 --> 32:16.429
- It's hers.
- Whose?

32:17.481 --> 32:19.138
Woman from today.

32:19.565 --> 32:21.304
She left it on board.

32:22.731 --> 32:25.221
Well, did you tell her?
Did you call her?

32:25.606 --> 32:26.606
No.

32:26.856 --> 32:30.356
I thought maybe you'd drop it off
for me in town at the hoteI.

32:31.815 --> 32:34.023
I'm not going to do it.
Take her the jacket.

32:36.398 --> 32:38.138
You don't want to see her again?

32:40.065 --> 32:40.898
Maybe.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.388
So?

32:44.148 --> 32:46.679
So, Dad, it's not an easy thing.

32:49.690 --> 32:51.231
You be her.

32:51.815 --> 32:52.846
I'll be you.

32:54.023 --> 32:55.429
Here's your jacket.

32:59.606 --> 33:01.179
Jackets like that...

33:01.565 --> 33:04.138
...don't come along
every week, you know.

33:15.690 --> 33:16.856
One second.

33:25.606 --> 33:26.440
You forgot this.

33:26.690 --> 33:28.013
Thank you.

33:28.731 --> 33:30.888
I stayed in.
I didn't even notice.

33:31.606 --> 33:32.721
Thanks.

33:34.773 --> 33:36.179
You want to come in?

33:44.106 --> 33:45.429
Nice place.

33:46.856 --> 33:49.179
It's Victorian, 1911.

33:49.606 --> 33:52.096
Made into an inn in 1944.

33:52.815 --> 33:53.648
But...

33:53.981 --> 33:55.856
...you probably knew all that stuff.

33:57.606 --> 33:59.346
I've never been in here.

34:00.023 --> 34:00.856
Oh, well.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.096
Why would you be in here?
You're from here.

34:04.356 --> 34:06.263
This is your hometown.

34:10.065 --> 34:12.106
I had a really good time today.

34:14.148 --> 34:15.013
The boat did well.

34:15.523 --> 34:17.846
We didn't have to baiI or anything.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.263
Thanks for bringing the jacket.

34:26.523 --> 34:27.898
You're welcome.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.940
I just said thank you
about eight times...

34:32.190 --> 34:35.023
...because I have no idea
what to say.

34:35.648 --> 34:39.554
I wonder why you're here, because
you don't know what to say either.

34:39.815 --> 34:41.096
I'm wondering that too.

34:50.106 --> 34:51.346
You eat meat?

34:53.481 --> 34:54.648
Eat red meat?

34:55.356 --> 34:56.846
Sometimes.

34:57.481 --> 34:59.971
I make a perfect steak.

35:01.273 --> 35:03.231
It's the best thing I do.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.721
- You're bragging.
- I know.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.398
But it's true.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.471
Well, that's very interesting.
Thanks for telling me.

35:18.773 --> 35:20.231
I'd like to make you one...

35:20.648 --> 35:21.846
...tomorrow night.

35:22.106 --> 35:23.304
You would?

35:28.106 --> 35:32.179
You know, on the boat today...

35:32.440 --> 35:34.346
...I had a good time too.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.763
What time?

35:44.315 --> 35:45.856
Six.

35:47.065 --> 35:49.190
It's 18 Foster Lane.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.596
I know.

35:51.690 --> 35:52.638
You do?

35:54.148 --> 35:55.523
I know...

35:55.773 --> 35:57.846
...it's got to be on the water.
Right?

35:58.981 --> 36:01.554
Right. Everything's on the water.

36:03.606 --> 36:05.513
- Night.
- See you.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.273
You found it.

36:37.106 --> 36:38.304
Come in.

36:38.856 --> 36:40.929
I didn't know you were so close.

36:41.273 --> 36:42.648
You walked!

36:44.106 --> 36:45.304
I hope you like red.

36:45.773 --> 36:47.929
I do. I already have one opened.

36:51.023 --> 36:52.263
You need some help?

36:52.523 --> 36:53.356
No.

36:53.648 --> 36:54.648
Just...

36:54.898 --> 36:56.606
...make yourself welcome.

36:57.523 --> 37:00.388
- Can I pour you a glass?
- Yeah, please.

37:05.773 --> 37:07.346
What a great house!

37:08.940 --> 37:10.398
The light in here...

37:24.481 --> 37:26.804
I love this boat painting.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.565
It's incredible.
You can hear it, almost.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.013
The wind.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.179
Is it a locaI artist?

37:34.981 --> 37:36.606
It's my wife, Catherine.

37:38.148 --> 37:40.304
She died two years ago.

37:44.356 --> 37:45.731
I'm sorry.

38:17.106 --> 38:18.221
Do you paint also?

38:27.523 --> 38:30.356
My dad died when I was in college.

38:30.648 --> 38:33.763
I remember my mom kept
one of his shirts...

38:34.023 --> 38:37.106
...on the back of a chair
in my parents' bedroom.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.929
And she probably
left it there for...

38:42.273 --> 38:44.513
Maybe it's still there,
I don't know.

39:24.023 --> 39:26.398
Look, I was nervous...

39:26.648 --> 39:29.429
...so I drank too much wine.

39:29.773 --> 39:33.679
But listen, there's something
that I should tell you.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.846
I was nervous too.

39:38.565 --> 39:39.565
I just...

39:43.481 --> 39:44.565
What?

39:50.523 --> 39:51.638
I didn't...

39:53.856 --> 39:55.596
I don't do this.

39:55.898 --> 39:56.981
Thank God.

39:57.231 --> 39:58.856
I don't do this either.

39:59.106 --> 40:00.429
I'm not good at this.

40:05.690 --> 40:08.690
For two people that don't do it,
we do it pretty well.

40:15.273 --> 40:17.888
Does it feeI cold enough for a fire?

40:25.065 --> 40:27.554
I thought we were still in love.

40:28.898 --> 40:31.221
But maybe I didn't even
think about it...

40:31.481 --> 40:35.315
...because I had my son,
my work, my husband.

40:35.981 --> 40:38.440
I was on my way to becoming a writer.

40:38.815 --> 40:40.554
And David and I...

40:40.815 --> 40:44.065
...were even talking about
having a second child.

40:45.065 --> 40:46.773
Can you believe that?

40:48.690 --> 40:50.763
Then one day I was just
driving along...

40:53.315 --> 40:54.554
...and I saw them.

40:56.523 --> 40:58.398
David and this woman...

40:59.981 --> 41:01.690
...walking into the park.

41:05.065 --> 41:08.148
And it was just a glimpse.
It was a second.

41:08.398 --> 41:09.940
And I knew.

41:12.315 --> 41:16.221
I sat there in my car. I didn't
shut off the engine. I just sat...

41:16.481 --> 41:18.221
...for an hour and a half.

41:21.273 --> 41:23.346
You're faced with the impossible...

41:23.606 --> 41:25.398
...and it takes an hour and a half.

41:34.315 --> 41:36.554
It was going on almost a year.

41:44.856 --> 41:47.388
I can't believe I just
told you all that.

41:48.898 --> 41:52.231
I mean, this stuff
happens to everybody, right?

41:54.773 --> 41:57.148
But it happened to you, Theresa.

42:00.898 --> 42:02.356
And I'm sorry.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.721
That kind of stuff
happen in St. Claire?

42:11.773 --> 42:14.440
Everything happens in St. Claire...

42:15.981 --> 42:17.263
...eventually.

42:25.148 --> 42:28.148
Tell me about Catherine.

42:33.023 --> 42:34.106
Well...

42:36.523 --> 42:38.481
...we grew up together.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.731
She was kind of...

42:45.731 --> 42:49.263
People were drawn to her
by her smile...

42:49.690 --> 42:51.013
...her enthusiasm.

42:54.481 --> 42:57.398
She could brighten up
a whole room...

42:57.690 --> 42:59.179
...whole town.

43:03.273 --> 43:05.888
I called her Saint Catherine.

43:11.231 --> 43:12.606
How did she die?

43:17.190 --> 43:18.429
She was ill.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.388
She was fragile.

43:23.940 --> 43:24.940
I'm sorry.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.231
It's all right.

43:30.606 --> 43:31.471
It's okay.

43:33.398 --> 43:34.940
Have you lived here
your whole life?

43:35.190 --> 43:36.138
Not yet.

43:39.273 --> 43:40.440
This place...

43:41.648 --> 43:44.023
...used to be all dirt roads
and marsh grass.

43:44.273 --> 43:45.190
Really?

43:45.856 --> 43:47.231
My mom hated it here.

43:47.481 --> 43:50.481
She took me away to Virginia
when I was ten.

43:50.773 --> 43:52.846
But I came back when I was 16...

43:54.565 --> 43:56.023
...and never left.

43:56.690 --> 43:59.096
I missed it.
I missed the smell of it...

43:59.356 --> 44:01.096
...working on the water...

44:01.940 --> 44:03.315
...missed my dad.

44:05.940 --> 44:07.054
The quiet.

44:09.315 --> 44:10.638
The wind.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.356
The wind?
You call that wind?

44:13.815 --> 44:14.929
The wind...

44:15.440 --> 44:17.565
...in Chicago in the wintertime...

44:18.690 --> 44:21.804
...you walk with your back to it
or it cuts your face.

44:22.065 --> 44:23.096
Takes your breath away.

44:27.606 --> 44:29.648
We got the oldest oak tree...

44:29.940 --> 44:31.315
...in both Carolinas.

44:32.023 --> 44:34.398
You try and top that.

45:42.106 --> 45:44.096
I just want to be close.

46:19.065 --> 46:20.440
Watch the dust.

46:24.815 --> 46:26.523
She took a look at my plans...

46:26.773 --> 46:28.596
...and never said a word.

46:29.731 --> 46:32.513
A week later she had it on canvas.

46:33.106 --> 46:35.429
This was going to be the first.

46:37.940 --> 46:40.513
Designing and building
my own boats...

46:41.315 --> 46:42.804
...that was the plan.

46:44.565 --> 46:46.940
This was going to be
my signature boat...

46:47.190 --> 46:48.815
...the one we'd never sell.

46:51.148 --> 46:52.773
And when will you finish it?

46:57.148 --> 46:59.606
I haven't touched it in two years.

47:01.481 --> 47:02.648
Someday.

47:03.106 --> 47:04.138
Right.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.471
Someday.

47:08.315 --> 47:10.138
And you'll take me out
on that boat?

47:10.398 --> 47:13.679
Around the point, where the wind
will scare me to death?

47:18.481 --> 47:20.304
There will be no wind tonight.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.263
And you know that?

47:26.648 --> 47:28.523
I'm the son of a fisherman.

47:28.940 --> 47:30.731
You watch the Weather ChanneI.

47:31.981 --> 47:34.054
Will you saiI with me tonight?

47:39.106 --> 47:41.013
I go back in a few days.

47:41.981 --> 47:45.346
And I can't change that,
because my son's coming home.

47:45.940 --> 47:49.273
I don't know if this makes sense.
Maybe-

48:01.231 --> 48:03.190
Well, that's a mistake...

48:04.815 --> 48:06.971
...letting her taste your coffee.

48:07.356 --> 48:09.148
Well, she liked it last night.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.263
She was just being polite.

48:11.898 --> 48:14.273
Nobody likes it, take my word.

48:14.940 --> 48:15.888
Be good.

48:19.356 --> 48:20.356
Oh, Lord.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.815
Now what?

48:26.815 --> 48:27.929
Go easy.

48:36.523 --> 48:37.763
Hold it right there.

48:38.023 --> 48:38.940
You stay out of our way!

48:39.190 --> 48:40.565
You're not welcome here, Johnny.

48:40.815 --> 48:42.221
You better stay out of our way!
Both of you!

48:42.481 --> 48:44.221
Guess the courts
turned you down again?

48:44.523 --> 48:46.315
- It's not your business.
- It's settled.

48:46.565 --> 48:48.638
No, we just want the paintings.

48:48.898 --> 48:50.304
They were part of our life here, Marta.

48:50.565 --> 48:52.804
The only one who sees them is you.

48:53.231 --> 48:54.773
People should see them.

48:55.565 --> 48:56.763
Please, Garret.

48:57.315 --> 48:59.106
It's all you left us of her.

49:00.731 --> 49:03.565
That's the first time you
called me her killer, Hank...

49:03.815 --> 49:04.815
...at least to my face.

49:05.065 --> 49:06.388
Nobody killed her.

49:06.648 --> 49:09.596
He left her alone when
she was sick and weak.

49:09.856 --> 49:12.179
- She wanted to come home to us!
- This was her home!

49:12.440 --> 49:13.606
Now he's killing her mother.

49:13.856 --> 49:15.898
I hear her heart break
every goddamn day.

49:16.148 --> 49:17.690
I gave you everything of hers.

49:17.940 --> 49:20.013
The paintings!
You got yourself another woman.

49:20.273 --> 49:22.971
- What the hell do you care?
- You son of a bitch.

49:23.231 --> 49:24.690
Just stay out of this.

49:24.940 --> 49:26.106
Step aside!

49:30.148 --> 49:31.263
She painted them here.

49:31.773 --> 49:32.856
She hung them here.

49:33.690 --> 49:36.606
She was the last to touch them!
That's how it'll stay!

49:38.940 --> 49:41.096
This is what you want, isn't it?

49:41.606 --> 49:43.648
If I cut it up
you can all have a piece.

49:43.898 --> 49:45.179
You can all have a piece of her!

49:45.731 --> 49:47.054
Just set it down, Dad.

49:47.315 --> 49:49.106
Step aside!

49:52.106 --> 49:53.429
My God...

49:54.356 --> 49:56.596
...is this what she is to you?

49:58.690 --> 50:01.804
Something to fight over, pull apart?
Look at you.

50:02.231 --> 50:04.523
All three of you
have blood in your eyes.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.221
Is that for Catherine?

50:06.690 --> 50:10.898
Or is that so you can walk around and
beat your chest like a bunch of apes?

50:11.148 --> 50:12.638
Goddamn it, you're outside of this.

50:12.898 --> 50:14.440
Well, I loved her too.

50:14.773 --> 50:16.981
And I want something
to remember her by.

50:17.231 --> 50:18.888
Piece of this will do.

50:25.065 --> 50:26.231
She'd hate this!

50:26.648 --> 50:27.846
She'd hate it, Hank.

50:28.106 --> 50:29.513
Dodge is right.
She'd hate this...

50:29.773 --> 50:31.231
...worse than dying!

50:52.023 --> 50:53.221
Crazy people.

50:55.190 --> 50:57.398
They're only half the war.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.221
You saw them.
You heard what they said.

51:03.731 --> 51:06.429
But you carry your half around
pretty good too.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.815
Are you okay with this?

53:46.981 --> 53:48.304
UntiI you...

53:53.440 --> 53:57.429
...I didn't even think about
being close to anybody else.

53:58.398 --> 53:59.773
Sometimes...

54:06.940 --> 54:08.815
...I still feeI her. She's...

54:09.648 --> 54:10.846
...here.

54:12.356 --> 54:14.815
And I don't want to
cheat you, Theresa.

55:16.190 --> 55:18.065
You're going to eat
that whole bag?

55:18.315 --> 55:20.190
Why do you have
two bags of marshmallows?

55:20.606 --> 55:21.773
Ammo.

56:02.148 --> 56:03.523
Wait.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.263
It's so great here.

56:33.273 --> 56:34.513
It was so nice outside.

56:34.773 --> 56:37.856
I decided to set the table out there.
Is that okay?

56:39.815 --> 56:42.106
You said to come in, right?

56:43.148 --> 56:44.263
I know.

56:45.523 --> 56:47.981
We can eat
in the kitchen if you want.

56:48.231 --> 56:52.638
And I got angeI food cake,
so I hope your dad likes cake.

57:01.106 --> 57:03.013
I was going to put that back.

57:06.856 --> 57:10.106
Look, I just didn't know
where the boundaries were.

57:16.273 --> 57:18.804
I didn't know where
the boundaries were either.

57:19.815 --> 57:21.971
Let me get this out of the way.
I'm sorry.

57:22.231 --> 57:23.179
I really-

57:26.106 --> 57:26.971
Let me get it.

57:27.231 --> 57:28.773
Let me clean it up, okay?

57:31.065 --> 57:32.940
- I'll get a rag. I can do it.
- I'll get it.

57:33.190 --> 57:34.304
I said, I'll get it!

57:38.356 --> 57:40.429
Just give me a minute.

58:02.523 --> 58:03.846
So you're the jacket.

58:05.523 --> 58:06.606
Yeah, that's me.

58:06.856 --> 58:09.471
You were looking around here
a couple days ago.

58:09.731 --> 58:11.054
Find what you wanted?

58:12.481 --> 58:13.596
I don't know.

58:14.856 --> 58:16.398
I'm Theresa.

58:18.440 --> 58:19.606
Dodge.

58:20.565 --> 58:21.846
Like the pickup.

58:22.856 --> 58:25.721
He said you were pretty.
He should've said beautifuI.

58:26.356 --> 58:28.179
Why didn't he inherit that charm?

58:29.273 --> 58:31.731
You had a fight.
That's a good sign.

58:32.565 --> 58:33.846
I made a mistake.

58:35.856 --> 58:38.471
I moved something
out of its place.

58:40.856 --> 58:42.898
Don't pay that any mind.

58:43.356 --> 58:44.596
He's still not right about it.

58:44.940 --> 58:47.856
It's like a truck hit him.
Swear to God.

58:51.690 --> 58:55.554
Clams, better here than anywhere.
Come on inside.

58:56.648 --> 58:58.356
It's pretty crowded in there.

59:00.856 --> 59:02.429
You want to take a walk?

59:08.398 --> 59:09.773
He won't tell you much.

59:10.023 --> 59:12.638
The man talks
about as much as a fish.

59:13.231 --> 59:14.315
Anyway...

59:14.565 --> 59:17.231
...wasn't good
right from the beginning.

59:18.023 --> 59:20.638
Her family thought
that she would be the one...

59:20.898 --> 59:24.179
...to bust out of here
and just shake the world.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.398
Garret was too much like them.

59:26.648 --> 59:29.731
They thought, anyway,
that he would be...

59:31.273 --> 59:34.221
...an anchor around her,
keep her life small.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.054
How did she die?

59:39.356 --> 59:42.554
Pregnancy just took
the stuffing right out of her.

59:44.481 --> 59:47.481
Keeled over at her parents' house
and they kept her there.

59:47.731 --> 59:51.513
So Garret went over
and kicked the door down.

59:51.773 --> 59:53.429
Carried her out.

59:53.773 --> 59:55.263
She was glad too.

59:56.856 --> 01:00:00.471
He took care of her
the best he could...

01:00:01.523 --> 01:00:03.929
...for about a month, I guess.
And then...

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.481
Well, she just...

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:08.054
...gave out.

01:00:15.606 --> 01:00:18.554
Now you know why Garret
don't talk much.

01:00:19.898 --> 01:00:22.106
Because his old man never shuts up.

01:00:22.356 --> 01:00:24.065
Can we eat now?

01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:33.190
You ought to
knock down some walls.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.231
It's getting too crowded in there.

01:00:35.815 --> 01:00:37.138
Can't afford it.

01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:39.023
Do the work ourselves.

01:00:39.273 --> 01:00:41.513
Just end up looking like a boat.

01:00:41.773 --> 01:00:43.013
Add a deck.

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:44.471
A couple of rooms.

01:00:44.731 --> 01:00:47.731
Why? You thinking about moving in?

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.388
Not in a million years.
You'd like that though, wouldn't you?

01:00:54.648 --> 01:00:55.763
Keep your eye on me.

01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:58.346
He's afraid I'm going to
go back to my old habit.

01:00:58.606 --> 01:00:59.929
Anybody want any cake?

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:01.565
I used to drink like a fish.

01:01:01.815 --> 01:01:04.138
It ruined my health.
It's no deep, dark secret.

01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:07.263
Well, it's no citizen award
either.

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:09.565
Two beers a day, that's my limit.

01:01:09.815 --> 01:01:11.554
Change the subject?

01:01:17.231 --> 01:01:19.981
The subject is change.
People change.

01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:23.148
Even you.
That is the subject.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.440
Good dinner.

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:30.898
You were the best thing about it.

01:01:31.148 --> 01:01:35.471
If I was about 150 years younger,
you'd be in trouble, young lady.

01:01:37.606 --> 01:01:38.888
Where you going?

01:01:40.273 --> 01:01:42.565
Taking my dessert on the beach.

01:01:42.815 --> 01:01:44.013
Thanks.

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.315
He likes me.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.888
Well, he's a...

01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:56.606
...good man.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:01.471
He said you were a pain in the ass.

01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:07.440
Kidding. That was me.

01:02:09.773 --> 01:02:11.263
Well, he's right.

01:02:13.606 --> 01:02:15.929
You are the best thing
about this dinner.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.096
And this day...

01:02:21.106 --> 01:02:23.315
...and this year.

01:02:27.981 --> 01:02:29.888
I wish it was simpler.

01:02:31.606 --> 01:02:33.315
I wish it was easier.

01:02:36.523 --> 01:02:38.096
And I'm sorry.

01:03:25.106 --> 01:03:27.231
Well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...

01:03:27.481 --> 01:03:29.106
...will we call each other?

01:03:29.898 --> 01:03:30.929
Well...

01:03:31.565 --> 01:03:33.388
...look, I was kind of...

01:03:33.648 --> 01:03:35.221
...hoping for flowers.

01:03:43.065 --> 01:03:44.773
I could live here.

01:03:47.981 --> 01:03:49.523
I didn't say that to scare you.

01:03:49.773 --> 01:03:52.013
I scared you, didn't I?

01:03:57.273 --> 01:03:59.315
So will you come and visit me?

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:01.179
You mean inland?

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.346
I don't go inland.

01:04:04.856 --> 01:04:05.971
We have a lake.

01:04:06.898 --> 01:04:08.554
A big lake.

01:04:09.106 --> 01:04:12.440
Okay. I'll just go back to
my work and my son and...

01:04:14.273 --> 01:04:16.429
...you'll just forget about me, right?

01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:19.606
Every day.

01:04:24.606 --> 01:04:26.513
I've got your number, sailor.

01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:29.096
And you've got mine. So...

01:04:42.273 --> 01:04:43.304
Bye.

01:06:12.773 --> 01:06:14.846
- And then what happened?
- Later, later.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.346
The wanderer returns.
How are you?

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.013
Yeah? So, solve your mystery?

01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:23.638
There was no mystery.

01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:25.888
He lost his wife, Catherine.

01:06:26.523 --> 01:06:27.898
She was an artist.

01:06:28.148 --> 01:06:30.554
And dead but not forgotten.

01:06:30.815 --> 01:06:33.815
Right. So that's it,
end of story?

01:06:34.106 --> 01:06:36.596
Basically, yeah.
There's no story.

01:06:37.106 --> 01:06:39.679
Kind of like-
Was it me that said that?

01:06:40.815 --> 01:06:41.846
So!

01:06:42.106 --> 01:06:44.263
Toodle-loo, on your way.
That's enough.

01:06:46.898 --> 01:06:47.898
Any regrets?

01:06:49.356 --> 01:06:50.190
Zip.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.013
No? Good.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.065
So, what was she like?

01:07:01.606 --> 01:07:04.888
She's beautifuI and wispy and...

01:07:05.148 --> 01:07:07.023
...a great artist.

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:09.023
And she's everywhere.

01:07:09.273 --> 01:07:10.731
She's in his house.

01:07:10.981 --> 01:07:13.221
She's in the shop.

01:07:13.898 --> 01:07:14.929
The whole town knew her.

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:16.648
Is he still in love with her?

01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:19.315
She isn't gone.

01:08:01.398 --> 01:08:04.096
That's for you.
And that's very interesting.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:24.595
Research. This is Theresa.

01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:28.220
It's me.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:31.138
Garret.

01:08:31.814 --> 01:08:32.981
I know.

01:08:34.898 --> 01:08:36.804
Sorry, I've been...

01:08:37.648 --> 01:08:39.606
I'm finishing the boat.

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:41.888
My boat.

01:08:43.273 --> 01:08:45.064
Ijust wanted to tell you.

01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:47.304
How are you?

01:08:49.564 --> 01:08:51.720
It's been a quiet few weeks.

01:08:55.314 --> 01:08:56.638
I didn't know...

01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.304
...what to say.

01:08:59.814 --> 01:09:01.388
I still don't.

01:09:02.273 --> 01:09:03.763
Need some help?

01:09:04.981 --> 01:09:07.470
I was counting on it.

01:09:09.773 --> 01:09:10.856
Question:

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:14.470
Were we just a casual thing
or something else?

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:17.148
Possibly a beginning?

01:09:17.398 --> 01:09:19.554
Just answers, no pressure.

01:09:23.898 --> 01:09:26.595
Just a playboy?
Nail those tourist women.

01:09:26.856 --> 01:09:28.138
I've only...

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:31.845
...cared about two women
in my whole life.

01:09:32.314 --> 01:09:33.689
Catherine and...?

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:35.814
Some city girl.

01:09:36.231 --> 01:09:37.554
Big mouth.

01:09:37.814 --> 01:09:39.095
Pushy.

01:09:40.981 --> 01:09:42.148
Thanks.

01:09:43.398 --> 01:09:45.773
You just called
to tell me about the boat?

01:09:47.814 --> 01:09:48.845
I miss you.

01:09:50.773 --> 01:09:52.679
I miss all of it.

01:09:57.398 --> 01:09:59.690
Why don't you come see me, Garret?

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:04.231
It's just a visit.
It's not a promise.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.398
Is that enough?

01:10:08.565 --> 01:10:11.231
Listen, you think I'm betting on us,
but I'm not.

01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:13.638
I'm just as scared as you are.

01:10:14.648 --> 01:10:16.606
And I miss you too.

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:20.940
Okay. When?

01:10:22.065 --> 01:10:24.596
When should I come?

01:10:26.065 --> 01:10:27.638
Yesterday.

01:10:28.773 --> 01:10:30.763
You're not coming by boat,
are you?

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:34.179
Jet Ski? Windsurfer?

01:10:44.898 --> 01:10:46.356
So behave yourself.

01:10:47.231 --> 01:10:48.231
You got your ticket?

01:10:50.565 --> 01:10:52.554
Of course I have my ticket.

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.648
Got my name on all my clothes.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.315
And I got a quarter for a phone call.

01:10:57.773 --> 01:10:59.731
You got a gift for that kid of hers?

01:11:00.773 --> 01:11:02.981
Get one at the airplane gift shop.

01:11:03.773 --> 01:11:06.804
Don't get into any fights
or anything.

01:11:07.481 --> 01:11:08.429
There it comes.

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.638
Right on time,
just like your old man.

01:11:10.898 --> 01:11:12.221
Don't throw your back out.

01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:14.304
Take your pills.

01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:19.721
By my count, there should be 2 beers
left in the fridge when I get back.

01:11:20.606 --> 01:11:23.221
That's a sorry occupation,
counting other people's beers.

01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:26.148
If you get Kenny or
any tourist kids to score you beer...

01:11:26.398 --> 01:11:27.565
...I'll hear about it.

01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:29.971
I got two counties covered.

01:11:33.648 --> 01:11:35.804
That lady sure got you gut-hooked.

01:11:37.773 --> 01:11:39.263
How'd you get to be so mean?

01:11:40.315 --> 01:11:41.481
See you in a week.

01:11:43.648 --> 01:11:45.940
The hell you say!

01:11:46.773 --> 01:11:49.346
Not with your
plane ticket on the seat here!

01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:01.263
Good dog.

01:12:26.648 --> 01:12:28.356
I think he's here, Mom.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.721
You're kind of nervous.

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:38.065
Really?

01:12:38.315 --> 01:12:39.773
I look great though, right?

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.231
Okay, is what I meant.

01:12:49.606 --> 01:12:51.231
You made it.

01:12:53.065 --> 01:12:54.013
Come in.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.523
I think he's disappointed that
you don't have a captain's hat on.

01:13:07.106 --> 01:13:09.315
That's what he was expecting.
Right?

01:13:09.565 --> 01:13:10.940
Come on in.

01:13:19.106 --> 01:13:22.606
I don't know if it suits
a boy your age, but...

01:13:22.856 --> 01:13:23.721
It's great.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.763
Thanks.

01:13:26.606 --> 01:13:27.888
Sweet, Garret.

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.065
He's into this mayhem thing.

01:13:36.315 --> 01:13:38.106
I think it's a male deaI.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.148
Garret, thank you.

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.773
She hates chocolates.

01:13:47.106 --> 01:13:48.481
It's really weird.

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:49.596
True?

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.606
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:57.440
Excuse me.

01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:04.690
Thank you.
That's what I really wanted.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.596
You got to be beat, no?

01:14:20.148 --> 01:14:21.315
I hope this is okay.

01:14:21.565 --> 01:14:23.388
This is fine.

01:14:23.648 --> 01:14:25.804
I mean, this is perfect.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.596
Tomorrow night, Jason will be at
a friend's house. So...

01:14:32.398 --> 01:14:34.554
Meaning what?

01:14:35.815 --> 01:14:37.096
Shut up.

01:14:38.648 --> 01:14:41.315
- I know this isn't very romantic.
- What?

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:42.679
This is my life.

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.731
No, this is...

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.554
...nice.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.981
It's nice.

01:14:48.231 --> 01:14:50.388
I just want you to know me.

01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:53.815
Just the day-to-day, regular me.

01:14:56.106 --> 01:14:57.846
You think you know me?

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:20.013
What?

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:21.606
What?

01:15:24.023 --> 01:15:25.346
He's not coming.

01:15:28.773 --> 01:15:30.398
But I've come so far.

01:15:37.356 --> 01:15:39.513
I don't even know.

01:15:43.648 --> 01:15:45.304
I'm glad you're here.

01:15:46.856 --> 01:15:48.731
I'm glad I'm here too.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.554
We're almost there.

01:16:22.606 --> 01:16:24.096
Wait. Is that him?

01:16:24.648 --> 01:16:25.679
That's him.

01:16:28.565 --> 01:16:30.388
Oh, my God.
Don't say a word.

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:31.856
Hey, buddy!

01:16:32.106 --> 01:16:33.106
What are you doing here?

01:16:35.273 --> 01:16:36.648
Train's pretty cooI.

01:16:36.898 --> 01:16:38.273
Can I use the computer?

01:16:42.148 --> 01:16:43.690
Jason wanted to surprise you.

01:16:44.606 --> 01:16:46.013
- Hope it's okay.
- It's fine.

01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:49.356
It's only for a minute, then
we'll hop back on that train.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.096
He's scared of it, Mom.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.648
I'm not scared of it.

01:16:57.815 --> 01:16:59.721
Annie. Garret.

01:17:02.148 --> 01:17:04.679
This is where I work.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.981
It was nice meeting you.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.273
Well, now I can
picture you on the job.

01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:30.106
So that's him. That's Ahab?

01:17:30.481 --> 01:17:32.388
That's him.
He's no Captain Ahab.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.273
Smile at him. Be friendly.

01:17:36.148 --> 01:17:37.888
- Friendly people.
- I know.

01:17:38.148 --> 01:17:40.138
He's smiling at her.
That's sweet.

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.096
Oh, behave!

01:17:43.315 --> 01:17:46.929
You're so negative, Charlie.
Don't you want her to be happy?

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:50.888
She'll smell of haddock
for the rest of her life.

01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:53.856
I don't know what I was expecting.

01:17:54.106 --> 01:17:55.981
I mean, I didn't realize...

01:17:56.315 --> 01:17:57.513
...everybody's close.

01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:01.440
Theresa, this came as
a big surprise to me...

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:05.356
...but apparently it is the poodle
that is the number one dog.

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.106
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:18:08.565 --> 01:18:11.023
- Hi, Lina.
- Hi, Jason.

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:15.471
Jason is taking Garret
into town sailing now.

01:18:15.731 --> 01:18:16.679
Really? So soon?

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.815
If he doesn't get lost first.

01:18:19.231 --> 01:18:21.023
I know there's a lake
around here somewhere.

01:18:21.273 --> 01:18:22.388
He senses that.

01:18:22.648 --> 01:18:25.565
Sensitive. If you
get into any trouble at all...

01:18:25.815 --> 01:18:28.763
...certainly give me-
the paper-a call.

01:18:30.356 --> 01:18:32.481
- You want to steer?
- Sure.

01:18:32.731 --> 01:18:34.013
You're the captain.

01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:37.096
You got to keep us going straight.

01:18:37.523 --> 01:18:39.013
Straight ahead.

01:18:49.627 --> 01:18:50.627
Here you go.

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:53.335
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:18:55.627 --> 01:18:57.252
The gang.
Hi, Lenny.

01:18:57.794 --> 01:18:59.533
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun.

01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:02.450
- Say bye to your mom.
- See you!

01:19:33.377 --> 01:19:35.450
I'm not used to having you here.

01:19:39.085 --> 01:19:41.127
It's okay, Garret.

01:19:43.627 --> 01:19:45.169
It's nice...

01:19:46.169 --> 01:19:48.294
...being among your things.

01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:53.252
Well, is it what you expected?

01:19:55.835 --> 01:19:57.294
It's comforting.

01:20:18.044 --> 01:20:20.669
You're making me self-conscious.

01:20:22.627 --> 01:20:24.283
What are you looking at?

01:20:25.127 --> 01:20:26.950
Theresa in her home.

01:20:31.585 --> 01:20:33.544
The regular everyday...

01:20:34.335 --> 01:20:35.710
...Theresa.

01:20:53.252 --> 01:20:54.450
Wait.

01:20:56.127 --> 01:20:57.460
I really...

01:20:57.710 --> 01:20:59.867
...wanted to make this right.

01:21:01.252 --> 01:21:05.085
I just wanted to straighten up
my room and light a candle and...

01:21:08.044 --> 01:21:10.033
And I need to take a shower.

01:21:17.835 --> 01:21:19.419
Garret, wait.

01:23:02.002 --> 01:23:05.033
One, two, three...

01:23:05.294 --> 01:23:08.169
...four, five, six.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.002
- That was a goodie.
- So scared.

01:23:12.252 --> 01:23:13.835
I'm so scared.

01:23:14.085 --> 01:23:15.669
That was big.

01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:21.575
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.

01:23:24.794 --> 01:23:26.294
Wait. Just...

01:25:14.585 --> 01:25:16.658
You're not going to believe what-

01:25:22.377 --> 01:25:24.533
Oh, God. Garret.

01:25:24.877 --> 01:25:26.752
Where did you get this?

01:25:30.794 --> 01:25:31.877
I found it.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:33.919
What do you mean, you found it?

01:25:34.169 --> 01:25:35.992
I found it on the shore.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.877
Garret, wait.

01:25:39.627 --> 01:25:41.585
It came to me.

01:25:42.044 --> 01:25:43.752
You have to trust me.

01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:45.075
Trust you?

01:25:45.794 --> 01:25:49.742
I just had to meet the person
that wrote it. I had to meet you.

01:25:50.085 --> 01:25:52.460
- I was going to tell you before.
- How could you find me?

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:57.252
Because I tracked all of the messages
and there were clues-

01:25:57.752 --> 01:25:59.627
All of the messages?

01:26:01.877 --> 01:26:04.992
They've all been found and people
saw it in the column and they wrote.

01:26:05.252 --> 01:26:07.825
I swear to God, I was
going to tell you, Garret.

01:26:08.085 --> 01:26:09.033
Garret, wait.

01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:10.794
I got to get out of here.

01:26:16.044 --> 01:26:17.075
Garret, wait!

01:26:17.335 --> 01:26:19.075
Why did you do this?

01:26:20.002 --> 01:26:21.252
Why?!

01:26:23.335 --> 01:26:25.127
Were you curious?

01:26:26.252 --> 01:26:29.335
- It's goddamn research!
- No, I'm falling in love with you!

01:26:29.585 --> 01:26:32.335
First in the letters
and then when I met you!

01:26:32.585 --> 01:26:34.575
And I'm sorry! I was afraid!

01:26:34.835 --> 01:26:37.627
I was afraid if I told you
that I would push you away!

01:26:37.877 --> 01:26:39.533
Just like I'm doing now.

01:26:41.252 --> 01:26:42.252
Wait!

01:26:42.502 --> 01:26:43.835
No matter what you think of me...

01:26:44.085 --> 01:26:45.825
...and no matter what happens now,
I want you to know...

01:26:46.085 --> 01:26:47.419
...how much I care for you.

01:26:48.210 --> 01:26:50.033
And it shouldn't matter...

01:26:50.294 --> 01:26:52.783
...what brought us together, Garret.

01:26:53.252 --> 01:26:56.044
I sent those letters into the sea
to her. Not to you!

01:26:56.502 --> 01:26:58.002
Not to all your friends at work!

01:26:58.252 --> 01:26:59.252
I know.

01:26:59.502 --> 01:27:01.460
They all knew about me, didn't they?

01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:03.710
All about Catherine?

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.575
My life was changed
by those three letters.

01:27:07.835 --> 01:27:09.908
- I didn't want it printed in the paper.
- Two letters.

01:27:10.169 --> 01:27:13.085
- You've got to believe me.
- I sent two letters to Catherine.

01:27:15.419 --> 01:27:16.502
What?

01:27:17.127 --> 01:27:19.960
I have all of the letters.
I have all three.

01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:24.252
Where's the third letter?

01:27:25.835 --> 01:27:27.544
Is it in that drawer?

01:27:36.544 --> 01:27:37.877
Catherine?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.033
To all the ships at sea...

01:28:06.335 --> 01:28:08.460
...and all the ports of call.

01:28:08.710 --> 01:28:10.085
To my family...

01:28:10.335 --> 01:28:12.627
...and to all friends and strangers.

01:28:13.294 --> 01:28:16.377
This is a message and a prayer.

01:28:17.085 --> 01:28:20.783
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

01:28:22.585 --> 01:28:25.127
I already had what everyone
is searching for...

01:28:25.377 --> 01:28:27.117
...and few ever find:

01:28:27.794 --> 01:28:29.669
The one person in the world...

01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:32.492
...who I was born to love forever.

01:28:33.127 --> 01:28:36.908
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

01:28:37.169 --> 01:28:39.408
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.

01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:44.335
A person rich in simple treasures...

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:47.585
...self-made, self-taught.

01:28:49.335 --> 01:28:52.085
A harbor where I am forever home.

01:28:52.335 --> 01:28:55.169
And no wind or trouble...

01:28:55.627 --> 01:28:59.627
...or even a little death
can knock down this house.

01:29:02.252 --> 01:29:07.377
The prayer is that everyone in the
world can know this kind of love...

01:29:07.585 --> 01:29:09.742
...and be healed by it.

01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:14.950
If my prayer is heard, then there
will be an erasing of all guilt...

01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:17.252
...and all regret...

01:29:17.544 --> 01:29:20.252
...and an end to all anger.

01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:22.669
Please, God.

01:29:23.627 --> 01:29:24.908
Amen.

01:29:36.085 --> 01:29:38.294
I never knew what she wrote.

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:42.460
She...

01:29:43.085 --> 01:29:45.242
...never came back from that day.

01:29:48.127 --> 01:29:51.127
I dried her.
I tried to keep her warm.

01:29:52.127 --> 01:29:54.117
Took her to the hospitaI.

01:29:55.294 --> 01:29:56.794
She never...

01:30:01.294 --> 01:30:03.835
She died three days later.

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:09.033
I keep thinking if she hadn't
gone out that day-

01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:10.877
Garret, she knew.

01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:15.794
She said it.

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:20.960
"Not even a little death can
knock down this house. " She knew.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.460
I want to...

01:30:28.794 --> 01:30:30.335
...keep this.

01:31:41.377 --> 01:31:44.377
I'm sorry.
Would you rather be alone?

01:31:51.127 --> 01:31:52.710
Has he called?

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:57.835
I left him a message, though.

01:31:59.919 --> 01:32:01.742
I said I was sorry.

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.950
And I asked him to call.

01:32:06.544 --> 01:32:08.419
Well, then, he will.

01:32:11.335 --> 01:32:13.158
Lina, do you remember...

01:32:14.085 --> 01:32:16.627
...what I was always complaining about?

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:19.950
All those times you let me cry
on your shoulder about David.

01:32:20.210 --> 01:32:21.460
Remember?

01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:25.242
Honesty. Trust.

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:31.794
I was so scared.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.710
I don't...

01:32:35.794 --> 01:32:38.710
I was falling in love
with Garret and I...

01:32:40.335 --> 01:32:42.044
Half of my mind was saying,
"Tell him"...

01:32:42.294 --> 01:32:44.335
...and the other half was saying...

01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:49.585
..."Just wait. He's not
going to understand.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.075
Wait till the right moment.

01:32:51.335 --> 01:32:54.044
Just wait till you have the
right words. " You know?

01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:57.585
And I blew it. I just...

01:32:57.835 --> 01:33:00.544
...killed it by being what I hate:

01:33:00.794 --> 01:33:01.794
A liar.

01:33:02.044 --> 01:33:03.627
You're not a liar.

01:33:04.752 --> 01:33:06.658
But to him I am.

01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:11.783
And I don't think he's ever
going to be able to trust me now.

01:33:12.294 --> 01:33:14.867
Don't you understand we all
have our own little lies...

01:33:15.127 --> 01:33:17.835
...and our little unspoken truths?

01:33:18.085 --> 01:33:22.033
And you just have to have a little
faith that he'll understand that.

01:33:24.210 --> 01:33:25.710
I don't know.

01:33:27.794 --> 01:33:29.783
I don't know if he can.

01:33:32.419 --> 01:33:37.127
I saw his pain. He was holding her
letter and he was reading it.

01:33:37.419 --> 01:33:39.210
And there was just...

01:33:40.919 --> 01:33:43.294
...so much pain and...

01:33:44.294 --> 01:33:47.085
He has so much love for her,
you know?

01:33:50.085 --> 01:33:51.367
I don't know.

01:35:24.002 --> 01:35:27.867
You said if I was ever thinking about
writing a piece for the paper...

01:35:29.252 --> 01:35:30.200
No kidding.

01:35:33.419 --> 01:35:34.919
Is he in here?

01:35:35.377 --> 01:35:36.460
No.

01:35:37.335 --> 01:35:38.752
Other stories.

01:35:39.002 --> 01:35:40.502
Good stories.

01:35:41.044 --> 01:35:42.700
It's about time.

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.283
People get hurt, they shut down.

01:35:48.002 --> 01:35:49.825
Till the pain goes away?

01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:52.450
I don't know.

01:35:53.169 --> 01:35:57.169
Maybe you just learn to take it in
like everything else.

01:35:58.544 --> 01:36:01.544
Kind of like a few pieces of cork
in a great glass of wine.

01:36:01.794 --> 01:36:03.533
You don't want to miss the wine.

01:36:04.794 --> 01:36:06.867
Is that in here?

01:36:07.127 --> 01:36:09.252
The cork in the wine thing?

01:36:10.252 --> 01:36:11.085
No.

01:36:11.335 --> 01:36:13.460
Good. I hate it.

01:36:20.002 --> 01:36:23.585
It may be that most of us
write our own life story...

01:36:23.835 --> 01:36:25.908
...making it up as we go along.

01:36:26.835 --> 01:36:31.002
But others seem to have lives
that are already shaped and planned...

01:36:31.627 --> 01:36:33.335
...inescapable...

01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:36.033
...perfect as a circle.

01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:42.044
Open it.

01:38:43.294 --> 01:38:44.710
Slowly.

01:38:50.044 --> 01:38:52.033
- This is exciting.
- It is.

01:38:58.169 --> 01:38:59.908
Front page of the section!
Great!

01:39:00.835 --> 01:39:01.752
Thanks, bud.

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:03.200
Can I cut it out?

01:39:03.710 --> 01:39:04.658
Sure.

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.450
- Is this okay?
- That is great.

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:10.752
That's perfect. Thank you.

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:19.502
Here's your maiI, ma'am.

01:39:19.752 --> 01:39:20.585
Thank you.

01:39:20.835 --> 01:39:21.752
Sure.

01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:55.752
Nice.

01:39:56.377 --> 01:39:58.419
I love what you've done here.

01:39:59.419 --> 01:40:01.492
- Very minimalist.
- Very nice of you to stop by, sir.

01:40:01.752 --> 01:40:05.960
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift
for your new phone booth office.

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:07.867
- Can I hang it?
- That is so sweet.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.627
I know.

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.669
You'll never guess who it is.

01:40:23.752 --> 01:40:25.169
You seem happy.

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:27.460
Is anything all right?

01:40:31.377 --> 01:40:32.835
Ahab.

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:35.575
May I?

01:40:39.794 --> 01:40:42.908
If you decide to go do something
wild and ridiculous...

01:40:43.169 --> 01:40:44.960
...it'll only prove one thing.

01:40:45.210 --> 01:40:46.835
And what's that?

01:40:48.794 --> 01:40:51.992
He's one lucky old son of the sea.

01:40:57.627 --> 01:40:59.950
That's a Charlie Toschi quote.

01:41:16.627 --> 01:41:20.294
You know, somebody's going to think
you're drying your skivvies up there.

01:41:24.544 --> 01:41:26.002
You look nice.

01:41:26.252 --> 01:41:28.242
Yeah, well, it hurts.

01:41:56.627 --> 01:41:58.669
She's beautifuI, Garret.

01:41:59.877 --> 01:42:01.294
Thanks, Marta.

01:42:03.294 --> 01:42:04.835
Go get them!

01:42:10.627 --> 01:42:11.825
Nice job, Garret.

01:42:40.794 --> 01:42:42.252
To Catherine.

01:42:42.502 --> 01:42:43.669
To Catherine.

01:42:44.877 --> 01:42:45.960
Wish to God...

01:42:50.002 --> 01:42:51.992
Wish to God she was here today.

01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:58.960
Every day.

01:44:42.127 --> 01:44:44.335
My dad said you were there.

01:44:44.752 --> 01:44:46.252
Wish I'd have known.

01:44:47.627 --> 01:44:50.117
A surprise. Dumb idea.

01:44:50.377 --> 01:44:51.710
No, it's...

01:44:52.627 --> 01:44:54.283
It's great to see you.

01:44:56.794 --> 01:44:59.002
- Glad you came.
- Me too.

01:45:00.127 --> 01:45:02.835
I saw the boat. It's beautifuI.

01:45:03.085 --> 01:45:04.460
It's great.

01:45:05.419 --> 01:45:07.075
I'm happy for you.

01:45:07.794 --> 01:45:09.669
You want to come inside?

01:45:30.794 --> 01:45:32.252
I'm sorry.

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:35.919
What I said must've hurt you.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.877
I just heard what
you couldn't tell me.

01:45:45.835 --> 01:45:48.044
Or maybe what I couldn't hear.

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.617
And I understand now.

01:45:51.794 --> 01:45:54.335
I think it's so beautifuI
the way you love her.

01:45:54.585 --> 01:45:56.658
No, you don't have to say anything.

01:45:57.252 --> 01:45:59.960
It's what made me want to find you.

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.710
Then stay with me.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.158
Come inside.

01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:10.252
Just stay as long as you want.

01:46:10.502 --> 01:46:14.200
I thought about it. I thought about
a lot of things sitting out here.

01:46:15.252 --> 01:46:16.419
And I can't stay.

01:46:16.752 --> 01:46:17.835
Why?

01:46:18.085 --> 01:46:19.825
Because if you can,
you'll come to me...

01:46:20.085 --> 01:46:23.752
...when it's right.
And if it's not right, it's okay.

01:46:24.877 --> 01:46:26.533
Because I wouldn't...

01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:28.960
...regret one minute.

01:46:30.335 --> 01:46:31.335
Not one.

01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:35.919
Bye.

01:46:46.002 --> 01:46:47.992
I don't want to lose you.

01:46:51.127 --> 01:46:52.502
Then don't.

01:47:10.252 --> 01:47:13.085
Why do you always sit
in the same place?

01:47:13.335 --> 01:47:14.877
What the hell you care where I sit?

01:47:15.127 --> 01:47:18.877
I'm curious. You started
sitting here 10, 11 years ago.

01:47:19.127 --> 01:47:20.158
For chrissake!

01:47:20.419 --> 01:47:22.294
You used to sit over there.

01:47:39.044 --> 01:47:41.117
Get the boy a cup of coffee.

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.544
You look like hell.

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.294
I'm okay.

01:47:54.294 --> 01:47:56.002
Catch up to her?

01:48:00.710 --> 01:48:01.960
You let her go.

01:48:03.335 --> 01:48:04.919
I don't want to talk about it.

01:48:05.169 --> 01:48:06.544
- Listen, I was-
- Go away.

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.669
She made up her mind.

01:48:16.085 --> 01:48:18.158
- The hell you want?
- Persistence.

01:48:18.419 --> 01:48:21.252
Get crazy. Go nuts.
A fight, for chrissake.

01:48:21.544 --> 01:48:23.252
You spent one afternoon with her.

01:48:24.502 --> 01:48:26.658
You don't even know who she is.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.794
What's...?

01:48:30.044 --> 01:48:31.544
Chicago.

01:48:32.044 --> 01:48:34.169
Three minutes. Get on the phone.

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:40.002
It's your last chance.

01:48:50.419 --> 01:48:52.294
Of course she walked away.

01:48:52.627 --> 01:48:54.085
She ain't stupid.

01:48:56.044 --> 01:48:57.544
Think she wants to try
to come between you and-

01:48:57.794 --> 01:49:00.283
- I don't have it all figured out.
- Who the hell does?

01:49:00.544 --> 01:49:03.627
Think it's easy for me to see
another woman in your house?

01:49:03.877 --> 01:49:05.377
Well, it ain't easy.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.700
I'll tell you one thing...

01:49:08.002 --> 01:49:10.210
...I'd give a million bucks
to see you grab her...

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:11.960
...and figure it out as you go along.

01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:13.044
Just drop it!

01:49:13.252 --> 01:49:14.585
- Drop it?
- Yeah. Drop it!

01:49:14.835 --> 01:49:16.002
Just...

01:49:19.335 --> 01:49:20.710
...forget about it.

01:49:21.585 --> 01:49:22.617
I can't!

01:49:27.502 --> 01:49:28.877
I can't forget about it.

01:49:30.252 --> 01:49:31.752
Why the hell not?

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.950
Because you're my boy.

01:49:37.627 --> 01:49:39.585
- It's not your business.
- What?

01:49:39.835 --> 01:49:42.585
I said it's not your business!

01:49:43.502 --> 01:49:44.960
Turn around.

01:49:46.419 --> 01:49:47.960
Turn around.

01:49:49.377 --> 01:49:51.002
Make a fist.

01:49:51.252 --> 01:49:52.710
Make it!

01:49:53.377 --> 01:49:54.877
Now you hit me!

01:49:55.127 --> 01:49:57.617
Hit me in the face,
you son of a bitch.

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:02.210
Not my business?

01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:04.783
My son is not my business?

01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:07.658
What the hell else have I got...

01:50:09.419 --> 01:50:10.960
...that's close to me?

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.460
Who else ever...

01:50:14.627 --> 01:50:16.252
...stuck up for me?

01:50:16.502 --> 01:50:18.377
Think I don't know your pain?
I do.

01:50:19.294 --> 01:50:22.825
Some of it I put there.
Think I can forget that?

01:50:25.252 --> 01:50:27.710
When she went to New York,
you could've gone with her...

01:50:27.919 --> 01:50:30.544
...and here I was, sick,
drunk, flat on my ass...

01:50:30.794 --> 01:50:32.450
...bringing you down.

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.325
Maybe the two of you,
it could've been different somehow.

01:50:41.085 --> 01:50:43.127
I didn't stay for you.

01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:46.085
This is who I am.

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:49.002
This place.
This is where I belong.

01:50:50.044 --> 01:50:52.877
She came back because she found out
she belonged here too.

01:50:53.127 --> 01:50:55.367
She chose for herself.

01:50:57.877 --> 01:50:59.950
God, I loved her for that.

01:51:02.085 --> 01:51:03.794
So did I.

01:51:05.627 --> 01:51:08.117
Now you choose. Choose...

01:51:08.377 --> 01:51:11.960
...between yesterday and tomorrow.
Pick one.

01:51:13.085 --> 01:51:14.460
Stick with it.

01:51:15.085 --> 01:51:16.825
And I will shut up...

01:51:17.419 --> 01:51:19.294
...and leave you alone.

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.960
"So you'll always know where you are...

01:51:55.335 --> 01:51:57.242
...and where home is.

01:51:59.419 --> 01:52:01.127
Love, Theresa. "

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.617
You heading for blue water?

01:53:05.627 --> 01:53:06.710
Yes, sir.

01:53:08.127 --> 01:53:10.252
Well, you know what you're doing.

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:13.700
Got it all figured out.

01:54:22.502 --> 01:54:23.419
Hey, bud.

01:54:24.335 --> 01:54:25.533
Time to get up.

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:29.835
Another day.

01:58:25.877 --> 01:58:29.075
They call him the Mayor of 43rd.

01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:33.033
He's so sweet. He knows everyone.
Helps people.

01:58:33.627 --> 01:58:36.710
The point is, it's his
70th birthday.

01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:40.544
Theresa, there's a phone call
for you.

01:58:40.794 --> 01:58:41.992
Can you take a message?

01:58:42.294 --> 01:58:43.460
It's urgent.

01:58:45.835 --> 01:58:47.210
Excuse me.

01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:49.117
You better take it in my office.

01:58:49.377 --> 01:58:50.877
Is it Jase?

01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:58.002
Hey, girl.

01:59:00.835 --> 01:59:02.492
I better...

01:59:03.502 --> 01:59:07.367
...get this said
while I can still talk.

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:12.158
There was a boat, Theresa,
offshore in trouble.

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:14.252
A family, there was three of them.

01:59:14.502 --> 01:59:16.127
Garret tried...

01:59:17.252 --> 01:59:19.960
Well, he tried to help, and...

01:59:21.627 --> 01:59:24.419
It's bad. He went down.

01:59:26.502 --> 01:59:27.835
What do you mean?

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:29.502
He went in after them.

01:59:29.752 --> 01:59:33.502
He got two of them.
But he went down, Theresa.

01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:36.617
I am so sorry.

01:59:39.502 --> 01:59:41.460
That's all I got now.

01:59:43.335 --> 01:59:44.669
Bye.

01:59:50.044 --> 01:59:51.835
Oh, my God.

02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.835
Hard times.

02:01:59.210 --> 02:02:00.710
Come on in.

02:02:08.794 --> 02:02:10.533
I found it on the boat.

02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:12.867
It was in his slicker.

02:02:36.794 --> 02:02:38.335
Dear Catherine:

02:02:38.877 --> 02:02:40.669
My life began when I found you...

02:02:40.919 --> 02:02:43.950
...and I thought it had ended
when I failed to save you.

02:02:44.419 --> 02:02:48.669
I thought that hanging on to your
memory was keeping us both alive.

02:02:48.919 --> 02:02:50.294
But I was wrong.

02:02:50.710 --> 02:02:52.585
A woman named Theresa
showed me that...

02:02:52.835 --> 02:02:55.242
...if I was brave enough to
open my heart...

02:02:55.502 --> 02:02:58.700
...I could love again,
no matter how terrible my grief.

02:02:59.044 --> 02:03:02.127
She made me realize
I was only half-alive.

02:03:02.377 --> 02:03:04.585
It scared me and it hurt.

02:03:04.835 --> 02:03:09.544
I didn't know how much I needed her
till the night she flew away.

02:03:10.877 --> 02:03:14.960
When that airplane took off, I felt
something inside me tear away.

02:03:15.294 --> 02:03:16.460
And I knew.

02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:18.210
I should have stopped her.

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.533
I should've follo wed her home.

02:03:21.044 --> 02:03:23.710
And now tomorrow, I'm going to sail
to the windy point...

02:03:24.002 --> 02:03:26.325
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.

02:03:27.377 --> 02:03:29.335
Then I'm going to go to this woman...

02:03:29.585 --> 02:03:31.992
...and see if I can win her heart.

02:04:43.377 --> 02:04:45.367
If I can, I know you'll bless me.

02:04:45.627 --> 02:04:47.127
And bless us all.

02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.075
If I can't...

02:04:49.335 --> 02:04:52.085
...then I'm still blessed because
I've had the privilege of loving...

02:04:52.335 --> 02:04:54.044
...twice in my life.

02:04:54.502 --> 02:04:55.877
She gave me that.

02:04:56.127 --> 02:04:59.627
And if I tell you I love her
as much as I loved you...

02:04:59.919 --> 02:05:01.992
...then you'll know the whole story.

02:05:04.169 --> 02:05:06.242
Rest in peace, my love.

02:05:06.502 --> 02:05:07.533
Garret.

02:05:36.502 --> 02:05:39.502
If some lives form a perfect circle...

02:05:40.210 --> 02:05:45.335
...others take shape in ways we cannot
predict or always understand.

02:05:46.335 --> 02:05:49.294
Loss has been a part of myjourney.

02:05:49.710 --> 02:05:53.044
But it has also shown me
what is precious.

02:05:53.669 --> 02:05:58.044
So has a love for which
I can only be grateful.
