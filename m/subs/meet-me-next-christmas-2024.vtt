02:01.125 --> 02:03.041
I'm on four standby lists.

02:11.541 --> 02:14.208
There's not gonna be any traffic
on Route 9 tomorrow, so,

02:14.208 --> 02:16.875
we'll be able to open our gifts at home
right before the parade.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.000
No, no, no. I insist.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.791

03:05.750 --> 03:09.041

It'll work.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.000
Merry Christmas to me.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.291
Did I say that out loud?

04:12.291 --> 04:13.916
You did.

04:13.916 --> 04:16.250
Sorry, you know what,
I said the same thing 20 minutes ago.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.500
It's not exactly
an ideal Christmas Eve, right?

04:18.500 --> 04:21.083
- No. Uh...
- Somebody sitting there?

04:21.083 --> 04:22.083
No, go for it.

brings the money out at the end.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.166
- Whoa, okay.

04:35.166 --> 04:39.333
I didn't know I'd meet Jimmy Stewart
here at the, uh, airport lounge.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.875
- Not quite, but, um...

04:41.875 --> 04:43.000
I'm James.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.833

- No, I'm a Layla.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.375

He must have dropped one inside my bag.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.291
I don't see him, though.

06:02.833 --> 06:06.125

This is definitely not where I expected
to spend my Christmas.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.250

06:24.250 --> 06:25.416
I should be at my sister's

but hypothetically,

07:50.125 --> 07:53.500
if two people met
and had the kind of connection we had,

07:54.166 --> 07:56.666
we'd probably think
they're meant to be together, right?

- Not.

08:08.416 --> 08:09.333
No.

Uh, I'm not trying to uncommit.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.291

08:24.083 --> 08:26.541
- You just put me on to Pentatonix, right?
- Yeah.

08:26.541 --> 08:30.583
On Christmas Eve... What if we meet
next Christmas at their concert?

08:32.250 --> 08:35.833
But only if, for some unimaginable,

08:35.833 --> 08:39.875
unforeseen, and probably unlikely reason,
you end up single.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.958

<i>♪ Don't feel like putting up the tree... ♪</i>

10:53.833 --> 10:57.666
I just don't understand.
I mean, he was so romantic.

10:57.666 --> 10:58.625
He...

10:59.125 --> 11:02.000
He made a birthday dinner
with all my favorite foods.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.583
You mean the one where he put peanuts
that he knows you're allergic to

11:06.583 --> 11:08.083
in the pad thai?

11:08.083 --> 11:09.416
That birthday dinner?

11:09.416 --> 11:11.958
Girl, he had you looking
like a beached blowfish.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.333
He's a doctor.
How did he forget your allergy?

11:14.916 --> 11:16.041
I don't know.

11:16.041 --> 11:19.166
What type of guy cheats on you
right before Christmas?

11:19.166 --> 11:20.708
The type of guy who kills your fish.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.041
- That was an accident.
- Was it, though? Was it, though?

11:24.041 --> 11:25.625
You know, I'm sorry.

11:25.625 --> 11:28.083
I refuse to believe
I was dating a fish murderer.

11:30.625 --> 11:31.916
It's just...

11:32.916 --> 11:35.041
- I always like to believe in fate.
- Mm-hm.

11:35.625 --> 11:39.625
- But I'm really struggling with this one.
Okay. Okay.

11:39.625 --> 11:43.041
Listen, maybe it's because I have
half a bottle of Pinot in me, but

11:43.041 --> 11:44.833
I'm gonna give you some tough love.

11:44.833 --> 11:47.666
- Mm.
- Tanner is a classic Layla pick.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.958
Smart, impressive, driven.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.083
A surgeon with a six-pack.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.166
Mm. Eight.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.041
- Ah! Oh.
- During the summer.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.125
But while all that stuff is cool,

11:58.125 --> 12:00.833
I feel like you might have overlooked
what's important.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.541
- Like free medical advice?
- Mm.

12:03.541 --> 12:06.000
That was some value-added, but no.

12:06.541 --> 12:09.541
Is he kind? Like, what are his priorities?

12:09.541 --> 12:12.250
Does he have your back?
Is he your ride or die?

12:12.250 --> 12:13.833
You know what? You're right.

12:14.416 --> 12:18.291
Tanner fell flat,
but my person will be all that.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.750
- Mm.
- That's it.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.458
- Oh, but you know what?

12:22.458 --> 12:26.333
I can't believe I gave up
on the cutest meet-cute for that idiot.

12:26.333 --> 12:29.541
- Right? Airport James!

12:29.541 --> 12:32.500
- Airport James.
- Where is that guy?

12:33.083 --> 12:34.750
No idea.

12:35.541 --> 12:38.416
You know, we made that promise
not to look each other up, right?

12:38.416 --> 12:41.583
I'm looking him up right now.
He's from Philly, right?

12:41.583 --> 12:43.041
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.166
- Oh, damn.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.750
- Any of these guys look familiar?
- Mm-mm.

12:49.541 --> 12:50.625
All right then.

12:50.625 --> 12:54.291
Ooh! I'm gonna bookmark you for later. Hi.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.458
- Oh my God.
- Hm?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.833
- Wait.

12:57.833 --> 13:00.041
We said we were gonna
leave it up to the universe,

13:00.541 --> 13:03.416
but we did make a promise
that if we were both single,

13:04.666 --> 13:08.583
we would meet at the Pentatonix concert!
Wait, wait, wait, it all makes sense!

13:10.375 --> 13:13.125
This is how epic love stories start.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.791
This is why I got cheated on
three days before Christmas.

13:15.791 --> 13:18.958
This is why you always get
Pentatonix tickets every year.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.000
- Except this year.
- What?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.833
God, Tanner wanted
to go see Macklemore instead!

13:24.958 --> 13:27.833
- And that wasn't a red flag?
- I know!

13:27.833 --> 13:31.791
Girl-- Okay, how do you usually get
your Pentatonix tickets?

13:31.791 --> 13:33.041
Um...

13:33.041 --> 13:35.541
I go to the, uh-- The Rockefeller website.

13:35.541 --> 13:37.541
- Okay. Rockefeller website.
- Mm...

13:39.750 --> 13:41.708
- Oh no!

13:41.708 --> 13:43.916
- No...
- Okay. Yeah, I know this sucks.

13:43.916 --> 13:46.250
But you know, it's been a year.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.791
He might be married
with a pregnant wife right now.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.083
Shut up.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.291
Would a man with a pregnant wife

13:56.291 --> 13:58.583
be buying a Pentatonix ticket
so he could be with me?

13:58.583 --> 13:59.875
- Girl--

13:59.875 --> 14:01.583
This is him. That is James!

14:01.583 --> 14:04.625
Oh my God! Wow!
Girl, you weren't kidding, he is fine.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.500
Roxy, the universe has spoken.

14:07.208 --> 14:10.458
Okay, what are the odds
that he would be buying a ticket

14:10.458 --> 14:13.166
at the exact same time
that they took this photo,

14:13.166 --> 14:16.291
and I, in turn, would see
this photo right here on the website?

14:16.291 --> 14:17.375
- Oh my God.
- Hm?

14:17.375 --> 14:20.666
A higher power,
or Father Christmas, or someone

14:20.666 --> 14:23.291
wants to make sure
that I am gonna be there.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.625
You try at Live Nation.
I'm calling American Express.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.208
We are getting you these tickets!

14:33.458 --> 14:38.416
I just offered the full 2,500
you said you had to this woman on OfferUp,

14:38.416 --> 14:40.916
and she told me to go screw myself.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.625
How much is she asking for?

14:42.625 --> 14:44.083
- Four.
- Hm.

14:44.958 --> 14:48.791
Girl, I'm sorry. I can't cover the extra.
But you know, I'm B and B.

14:48.791 --> 14:50.791
Yeah, broke and bougie.

14:51.583 --> 14:55.000
What am I gonna do? Huh?
I mean, James is going to show up.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.791
He's gonna expect this magical moment,
and I'm not gonna be there.

15:02.416 --> 15:03.708
Wait. Wait.

15:03.708 --> 15:07.000
Wait, wait, wait! I can't believe
I didn't think about this sooner!

15:07.000 --> 15:08.750
- What?
- Impromptu!

15:08.750 --> 15:09.708
Imprompt-who?

15:09.708 --> 15:12.166
It's a personal concierge service.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.708
They can get you
anything you can think of.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.625
The owner of the gallery where I work
had me call them

15:17.625 --> 15:19.833
to get this bottle of wine
for her husband's birthday

15:19.833 --> 15:21.500
that no one had.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.583
Yes! Yes. Yeah, take me to them.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.958
- And that we just drank.
- Oh no.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.416
So it looks like I'll have
to call them back anyway.

15:29.416 --> 15:31.000
- Hey!
- Hey!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.541
But, Layla, they're not cheap.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.041
- I don't care.
- Oh!

15:34.708 --> 15:36.166
- Okay.
- James might be my person.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.458
We will call them
first thing in the morning!

15:38.458 --> 15:40.666
We are going to get you this ticket!

15:40.666 --> 15:43.833
- These people are miracle workers.
- Mm-hm.

15:43.833 --> 15:44.916
They are.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.166
Good morning, everyone! Sorry I'm late.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.250
But this is how I do Christmas.

16:10.250 --> 16:15.166
Plus, I had to wait for my fudge to set.
It's a new recipe, and it's fire.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.750
Everything on the top is gluten-free,
yes, for those who care.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.750
You know what doesn't say Merry Christmas?

16:20.750 --> 16:21.875
A colitis flare-up.

16:21.875 --> 16:22.875
- True!
- Mm-hm.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.500
All right, everyone.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.708
Work is now.

16:25.708 --> 16:29.041
Save the goodies for break time.
Teddy, we need to talk.

16:29.041 --> 16:31.666
Boss lady, I didn't forget about you.

16:31.666 --> 16:34.666
Now, I know this may be
a weird Christmas present,

16:34.666 --> 16:37.833
but it's your favorite, cioppino.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.833
Oh, Teddy, I love all of your--

16:41.458 --> 16:44.291
Wait, I don't want to talk about cioppino.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.208
We need to talk about your job.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.791
Okay, so, there's a woman in your office.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.083
Her name is Layla.
She's your client for today.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.541
Have we ever had a client
come into the office before?

16:54.541 --> 16:58.625
No. I've also never had a client
send me three emails before 5:00 a.m.

16:58.625 --> 17:01.291
and beat me to the office
two days before Christmas.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.416
So why she gotta be--

17:02.416 --> 17:06.333
Apparently, she desperately needs a ticket
to the Pentatonix show tomorrow night.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.083
Oh, I love Pentatonix.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.833
Teddy, focus, because I don't have time
to sugarcoat this.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.541
Your client reviews suck.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.333
I-- I mean,

17:17.166 --> 17:20.000
I like to say
that there's room for improvement.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.458
I'm gonna level with you.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.458
- Oh boy.
- You're talented.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.500
Your cioppino is a triumph,

17:25.500 --> 17:28.500
but being a concierge
is not your strong suit.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.583
Right.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.541
Your probationary period is about to end,

17:31.541 --> 17:34.583
and I need to decide
whether we're going to keep you on.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.958
Come on, Louise,
you know how much I need this job.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.458
I know. Uh--

17:38.958 --> 17:40.833
That's why I'm giving you this assignment.

17:40.833 --> 17:43.416
Get the woman her ticket,
and get a good review,

17:43.416 --> 17:45.583
and give me a reason to keep you employed.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.625
Got you.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.416
Got you.

17:57.916 --> 17:58.916
Layla?

17:59.791 --> 18:02.875
Hey, can I, uh, get you a coffee
or hot chocolate or something?

18:03.791 --> 18:04.916
Wow, uh...

18:04.916 --> 18:07.916
I've never been offered hot chocolate
in a professional setting before.

18:07.916 --> 18:09.500
I'll pass, but thank you.

18:15.416 --> 18:17.250
What? Is there something in my hair?

18:17.250 --> 18:19.083
I got it. Lincoln High.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.958
Me? Oh, no. No.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.291
- Wilson Elementary?
- No.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.375
I never forget a face.
Just give me a minute.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.041
Okay, I-- I don't really have a minute.

18:30.041 --> 18:31.541
I really need to get this ticket.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.833
So do you know
when I'm gonna meet my concierge?

18:35.083 --> 18:37.041
That's me. I'm Teddy.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.791
Your fully licensed,
well, we're not really licensed,

18:40.791 --> 18:43.125
but, um, your fully trained concierge.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.333
Oh. Oh. Okay. You know, I am so sorry, I...

18:46.333 --> 18:49.458
You're not in a suit
like everyone else here.

18:49.458 --> 18:51.250
Yeah, well, that's, um...

18:51.250 --> 18:53.916
It's not technically required, you know...

18:53.916 --> 18:56.625
Just really strongly encouraged.

18:59.708 --> 19:01.916
Let's get you this ticket, right?

19:01.916 --> 19:04.541
- Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. Um...

19:04.541 --> 19:06.625
You know, I am kind of freaking out

19:06.625 --> 19:09.833
because I have tried everything,
and nothing's working.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.750
I don't really know the that city well,
and we have about, what? Mm...

19:12.750 --> 19:14.000
Oh God, 35 hours.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.916
Minus the two it'll take me to get ready,
so that's about 32.5.

19:16.916 --> 19:18.000
More or less.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.916
Right.

19:20.916 --> 19:25.000
Got it. Thank you very much
for that extremely specific timeline,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.375
but lucky for you,
it'll only take a few minutes.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.708
- Let me hop on Live Nation real quick.
- Oh, I already jumped on Live Nation.

19:30.708 --> 19:34.500
And Ticketmaster,
TickPick, StubHub, and OfferUp.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.708
I'm waiting to hear back
from some people on Craigslist,

19:36.708 --> 19:39.125
and apparently,
someone's offering one up as a--

19:39.916 --> 19:41.750
as a tip on OnlyFans, but I won't do that.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.791
- OnlyFans?
- They asked for pictures of my feet.

19:44.791 --> 19:48.041
- So I signed out and cleared the history.
Oh. Mm-mm.

19:48.041 --> 19:51.000
But I am very sure that Impromptu has

19:51.541 --> 19:54.458
lots of connections
to other ticket brokers and stuff, right?

19:54.458 --> 19:56.250
Yes. Absolutely. We do.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.708
Uh, as a matter of fact,

19:57.708 --> 20:00.416
we have our own database
of available tickets to concerts.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.750
So, if, uh, you just give me one second,

20:02.750 --> 20:06.291
you know, you just stop talking,
you little chatty Patty, um...

20:15.000 --> 20:18.041
What's that sound?
It kind of sounds like a "no" sound.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.875
That's because it is a "no" sound.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.250
Okay, listen, Teddy.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.208
Look, I really, really need this ticket.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.416
Don't panic. Um, I actually know a guy.

20:27.416 --> 20:30.125
He's not in the database,
but he has tickets to everything.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.833
- All right, let's call him.
- Um, no, I--

20:32.833 --> 20:35.708
Well, you can't just call him.
He's old-school.

20:35.708 --> 20:38.541
He doesn't even have a phone.
You gotta just show up at his kiosk.

20:38.541 --> 20:42.916
Now that I think about it, I gotta hustle.
He closes early around the holidays.

20:42.916 --> 20:44.708
- So...
- Great, fine. Let's go.

20:45.416 --> 20:48.375
"Let's go"? No, no, no. That's no.

20:48.375 --> 20:51.500
Um, I can just pick up the ticket for you,
and I can deliver it.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.250
- That's part of the service.
- Okay, listen.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.916
My entire romantic future
might hinge on this ticket.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.333
I'll stay with you every step of the way.

21:00.833 --> 21:01.666
You--

21:03.583 --> 21:04.916
After you.

21:06.541 --> 21:07.416
Damn.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.500
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

21:11.500 --> 21:12.875
Yes, yes, yes!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.708
I got it.
New Year's last year, Times Square.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.625
Nope.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.958
New Year's, ex-boyfriend, house party.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.750
Damn, I thought that was you.

21:28.541 --> 21:30.250
It's right up here.
Okay.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.916
Told you I got you.
I know where to get this ticket.

21:32.916 --> 21:36.333
Wait, one of the guys hit me up
from Craigslist. He has a ticket.

21:36.833 --> 21:40.125
- What guy?
- Uh, some guy from Davey's Tickets.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.416
"Davey's Tickets"?

21:41.416 --> 21:43.875
I ain't never heard of them.
That can't be legit.

21:43.875 --> 21:47.041
Okay, so we're headed to a kiosk
that doesn't have a phone,

21:47.041 --> 21:48.708
but my guy doesn't sound legit?

21:48.708 --> 21:49.833
Um...

21:49.833 --> 21:54.333
This is my job. I've worked with almost
every licensed ticket broker in the city.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.625
If I haven't heard of them,
then it has to be a scam.

21:56.625 --> 21:59.333
Plus, my guy's kiosk is right...

22:00.291 --> 22:01.125
there?

22:01.750 --> 22:04.791
Oh! So I guess he ran out on the lease.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.416
I don't think so. Let me just--

22:07.416 --> 22:10.500
Okay, so the guy from Davey's Tickets
said he can meet us in the Village.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.541
- Aren't we close?
- Yeah, we're close, but don't even--

22:13.541 --> 22:16.541
Okay, we don't have very many options, so...

22:16.541 --> 22:20.291
Unless you went to school with Scott
from Pentatonix and forgot to tell me.

22:20.291 --> 22:23.375
Um, I am a professional concierge.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.875
Okay? I got plenty of channels.
Just give me a sec.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.666
Mm-hm. I'm sure you do.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.625
Right now we're gonna try my channel.

22:32.625 --> 22:34.958
Desperate times, desperate measures.

22:37.708 --> 22:39.125
Okay.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.125
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.708
- Thank you.
- Hey, how did we sound at the parade?

22:44.708 --> 22:46.708
- Um, great, fantastic.

22:46.708 --> 22:51.416
- You weren't even watching, were you?
- I was not, but I'm sure you were great.

22:51.416 --> 22:54.416
Oh, Becca, very important.
My aunt is coming into town.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.958
She's gonna bring four friends.
We need to put them on the list.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.041
Well, four of my other aunts.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.000
Oh, that reminds me.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.958
I wanna bring my best friend,
and she's a part of Bunk Whippoorwill.

23:02.958 --> 23:05.208
I feel like I should invite the group
because I'm what?

23:05.208 --> 23:06.416
<i>♪ Thoughtful! ♪</i>

23:06.416 --> 23:07.916
Oh, Jesus.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.791
That would be like, what?
Twenty-three tickets?

23:10.791 --> 23:12.250
Oh. Oh, no.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.416
No, no.

23:13.416 --> 23:15.875
You guys used up
your friends and family tickets weeks ago.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.791
- There's none left.
- Okay, print more.

23:17.791 --> 23:20.666
So, that's not how it works.
Ever take an economics class?

23:22.916 --> 23:26.458
- Becca, I'm a pop star.
- Right. Well, this list is very closed.

23:26.458 --> 23:29.750
Okay, no, that's not gonna work.
I had to put my facialist on the list.

23:29.750 --> 23:32.041
- You have a facialist?
- Your face is gorge.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.708
I know.
That's why I can't have her mad at me.

23:34.708 --> 23:35.958
Oh, got it.

23:35.958 --> 23:38.333
I literally don't know
what else to tell you.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.375
We have no tickets left.
The show's sold out. That's it.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.791
Okay, "famous."

23:42.791 --> 23:45.500
- That's what I was gonna say.
-"Sold out."

23:45.500 --> 23:47.583
- Life is so surreal!
- That's crazy.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.000
So, this is
where he wants you to meet him?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.333
A dive bar at 9:30 in the morning.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, this is definitely legit.

24:26.916 --> 24:29.000
Okay, you know what, Teddy?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.666
When I was a teenager,

24:30.666 --> 24:34.125
I got NSYNC tickets from a guy
in an abandoned Quiznos.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.916
Was it weird? It was.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.250
Were the tickets legit? They were.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.583
And did I go to the concert,

24:39.583 --> 24:42.041
and did JC wink at me
during "Bye Bye Bye"?

24:42.041 --> 24:42.958
He sure did.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.833
The point is,
sometimes you gotta take risks.

24:54.416 --> 24:55.625
Do you think that's Davey?

24:55.625 --> 24:58.166
There is literally nobody else here.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.458
You must be Layla.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.041
I am. I am.

25:05.791 --> 25:08.500
- How professional of you to notice.
- Wow.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.875
I know what you're thinking.
Sketchy scalper in a creepy dive bar.

25:12.875 --> 25:15.583
But I've got
a perfectly good explanation for this.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.875
- I'm an alcoholic.
- Okay. All right.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.250
No, I'm just kidding.
This is a great place to meet clients.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.791
It's never crowded, so...

25:24.708 --> 25:26.375
- That was a joke.
- Yeah.

25:26.375 --> 25:29.625
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
there's a Starbucks down the block.

25:29.625 --> 25:33.708
Um, sorry, am I getting
professional advice from a college intern?

25:34.916 --> 25:38.125
- I'm not a college intern.
- Sorry, your outfit says otherwise.

25:39.791 --> 25:43.750
How did you get a ticket?
I couldn't seem to find one anywhere.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.625
- Well, it was tough, but it's my job.
Mm.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.125
I'm not gonna lie.

25:48.125 --> 25:53.000
I had a few people outbid you, but man,
I really fell in love with your story.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.083
Oh!

25:54.083 --> 25:57.208
A kismet Christmas Eve meeting
in an airport.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.291
It's adorable.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.666
How much did you tell this guy?

26:00.666 --> 26:05.125
It just came up when we were texting.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

26:05.125 --> 26:08.250
Thank you so much for picking me.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.333
You're really saving my Christmas.

26:10.958 --> 26:14.000
- Ah. That's all the payment that I need.
Oh!

26:14.000 --> 26:16.375
That and the $800 we agreed upon.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.083
Uh, wait. You said eight?

26:18.083 --> 26:19.583
I thought you said five.

26:20.416 --> 26:21.541
Wait. Uh...

26:21.541 --> 26:22.666
I only have five.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.583
You're walking around
with this much money?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.416
You clearly are not
from around here, are you?

26:26.416 --> 26:28.333
No, the stakes are high, buddy.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.541
Are you-- Mm.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.375
- Had to be prepared for anything.
- Okay.

26:32.375 --> 26:34.583
I hope you're prepared to pay eight.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.166
I was offered 12...

26:37.166 --> 26:39.500
You know, maybe I was texting
with a different Layla.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.958
No, it was this Layla.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.791
I really need these tickets.

26:44.416 --> 26:45.541
Seven.

26:46.291 --> 26:49.416
Don't haggle.
You only have five.

26:49.416 --> 26:51.541
Um-- Mm--

26:51.541 --> 26:54.375
- You know what? I have my card!
- Oh--

26:54.375 --> 26:57.458
Mm. No, sorry, gross.
The credit card fees, they...

26:57.458 --> 26:59.125
- They ruin my profits.
Okay.

26:59.708 --> 27:00.916
- Well, okay...
- Uh...

27:02.875 --> 27:04.791
Layla. Lay-- you...

27:04.791 --> 27:07.208
- Do not give that to him.
- It's worth about 150.

27:07.833 --> 27:10.208
- Layla, do not give that to him.
- I'll take it.

27:11.708 --> 27:13.375
Okay, and, uh...

27:14.416 --> 27:17.166
Sending the tickets to you. Done!

27:17.166 --> 27:18.458
Got it!

27:18.458 --> 27:22.000
Well, your fairy tale begins now.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.833
Oh.
- Enjoy the show tomorrow night.

27:23.833 --> 27:27.958
- This James is a really, really lucky guy.
- Um, who's James?

27:28.458 --> 27:31.666
The guy from the airport
that she's meeting at the show tomorrow.

27:31.666 --> 27:34.041
Am I the only person
that's never heard this story?

27:34.041 --> 27:36.083
- Happy holidays, you two.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.750
And you thought he wasn't legit.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.791
- This ticket is from last year. Hey!
- What?

27:40.791 --> 27:42.291
Hey! Uh-uh! Nope. Nope!

27:42.291 --> 27:44.333
- Uh-uh! Give it.
- I thought we were friends!

27:46.791 --> 27:47.833
- God!
I'm sorry.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.750
My eyes!

27:48.750 --> 27:50.500
I'm sorry! Davey!

27:53.166 --> 27:55.166
What do you think about my hips in this?

27:55.166 --> 27:56.333
Do you want the truth?

27:56.333 --> 27:58.458
- They're okay.
- Sign those posters.

27:58.458 --> 27:59.625
Shoot.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.791
Okay. So after this,

28:02.791 --> 28:05.125
you're gonna be on <i>The Today Show</i>
for a performance,

28:05.125 --> 28:07.375
then you'll do SiriusXM for about an hour,

28:07.375 --> 28:10.458
then a journalist is gonna meet you
in the hotel room for a little interview,

28:10.458 --> 28:11.541
and then you're done.

28:11.541 --> 28:14.583
So, I guess I'm not seeing
a Broadway show tonight.

28:14.583 --> 28:17.000
Look, guys, I know this is a lot of work,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.708
but after the holidays,
we're gonna have a ton of downtime.

28:19.708 --> 28:20.958
- Wait, really?
No.

28:21.458 --> 28:22.833
- No.
- Yes.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.375
- Oh God, Teddy.

28:24.375 --> 28:26.291
- What happened? Wait.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.083
- Who's Teddy?
Oh, sorry.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.000
No, it's nothing.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.500
He's this concierge

28:31.500 --> 28:33.791
who keeps blowing up
the DMs on your account.

28:33.791 --> 28:35.166
Normally, I wouldn't engage,

28:35.166 --> 28:37.875
but he just got pepper-sprayed
trying to get a ticket for a fan.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.125
- Oh no.
- What? Let me see that.

28:40.916 --> 28:44.875
- Oh, this guy's a real oversharer.
He really wants that ticket.

28:44.875 --> 28:48.166
He keeps saying his client's
romantic future is on the line.

28:48.166 --> 28:51.833
Wow. I just want to point out
that my dewey face was on the line.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.125
There could be
a potential love story happening.

He seemed so sweet.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.958

was clearly a con artist?

30:10.958 --> 30:14.125
Look, people don't do stuff like that

30:14.125 --> 30:15.208

30:23.750 --> 30:26.083
before they actually find
what they're looking for.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.291
- Hm.
- You gotta let me go through my process.

30:28.291 --> 30:31.833
And where are we in your process?

30:33.041 --> 30:34.416
Making headway.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.583
I actually have a line on a client
who has Pentatonix tickets.

30:38.583 --> 30:39.625

30:44.875 --> 30:48.916
If it's really that important to you,
why don't you just DM the guy?

30:48.916 --> 30:50.708
Tell him you can't get a ticket.

30:50.708 --> 30:52.041
When James and I met,

30:53.333 --> 30:54.625
it was like magic.

30:55.791 --> 30:59.416
Except it was just the wrong place
and the wrong time.

30:59.416 --> 31:02.416
So we decided
if we were truly meant to be,

31:03.250 --> 31:04.958
fate would bring us back together,

31:05.750 --> 31:09.500
which is why I need
these tickets to this concert.

31:10.541 --> 31:13.750
I might be in the middle
of the cutest meet-cute of all time.

31:13.750 --> 31:14.875
All right?

31:14.875 --> 31:17.458
- James might be my person.

31:17.458 --> 31:21.250
So you actually believe
that every person has a person?

31:21.250 --> 31:23.458
Yeah, don't you?

31:23.458 --> 31:24.583
No.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.541
No, I don't.

31:25.541 --> 31:27.250
Okay.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.458
All right. Listen to that.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.708
You hear this song?

31:30.708 --> 31:34.875
That is the song that I played to James
to introduce him to Pentatonix.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.666
All right? It's a sign.

31:36.666 --> 31:39.791
Or it's a Christmas Spotify playlist.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.583
No, it's fate.

what the universe is saying to you,

31:46.666 --> 31:50.625
but I know that I'm responsible for making
this love connection happen, so...

31:52.291 --> 31:53.583
Hm. Good news.

31:54.250 --> 31:57.416
The client just got back to me.
He wants to meet up about the ticket.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.125
Okay. Well, what are we doing? Let's go.

32:02.708 --> 32:06.291
<i>♪ This Christmas ♪</i>

32:06.291 --> 32:08.375
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

32:08.375 --> 32:12.000
<i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>

32:12.000 --> 32:13.250
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

32:13.250 --> 32:14.791
Thank you, sir.
- My pleasure.

32:15.291 --> 32:18.666
<i>♪ Ooh, do-do-do-do ♪</i>

32:20.583 --> 32:21.708
- Wow.
- Whoa.

32:26.666 --> 32:27.625
Teddy.

32:28.791 --> 32:31.125
I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.541
Yeah, I don't think we're even
in Manhattan anymore.

32:33.541 --> 32:36.791
Oh! Whoa! Look at this ceiling!

32:38.541 --> 32:40.166
Look at the ceilings!

32:40.166 --> 32:41.958
You must be Teddy and Layla.

32:42.666 --> 32:43.500
Yeah.

32:45.708 --> 32:46.750
Whoa.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.250
Is something wrong?

32:51.250 --> 32:54.416
Um, no. No, um...

32:56.041 --> 32:56.958
I think...

33:02.666 --> 33:03.666
Yeah, uh...

33:08.583 --> 33:10.833
You're here for one
of my Pentatonix tickets.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.583
Uh, actually...

33:14.458 --> 33:16.291
I need

33:17.500 --> 33:19.000
one of your Pentatonix tickets.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.458
Well, here's the thing.

33:20.958 --> 33:23.375
We really love Pentatonix.

33:23.375 --> 33:24.291
Oh, yeah.

33:24.291 --> 33:26.750
Their voices speak to us.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.083
- Deeply.
- So deep.

33:30.083 --> 33:31.583
So very deep.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.083
Uh...

33:36.083 --> 33:37.541
- Yeah...

33:37.541 --> 33:39.000
Um, you love the band.

33:39.916 --> 33:43.791
Yes, and we were told
that you may have a ticket

33:43.791 --> 33:46.708
that you <i>might</i> want to sell to us.

33:46.708 --> 33:47.625
All right.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.333
You two negotiate.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.458
And you follow me.

33:53.875 --> 33:54.791
Come along.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.208
- Layla.
- I need those tickets.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.333
Layla!

33:59.041 --> 34:00.083
- There you are.
- Hi.

34:04.583 --> 34:06.916
- Now, I have to power shop.
- Hm.

34:06.916 --> 34:10.041
The designer's assistants
will be back for this rack in an hour.

34:10.041 --> 34:14.500
I would appreciate a woman's opinion,
so have a look.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.500
Designers?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.041
Yes.

34:17.041 --> 34:20.833
Like this one from LaQuan Smith.
Original, never worn.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.416
- Oh. Wow.

34:22.416 --> 34:23.750
- He dresses everyone.
- Mm.

34:24.291 --> 34:26.041
Beyoncé, Rihanna, Serena.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.708
- Must cost a fortune.
- Hm. Yes.

34:28.708 --> 34:32.958
Javi goes overboard at Christmastime,
especially as it's our anniversary.

34:33.458 --> 34:36.916
Christmas is such a romantic
and magical time.

34:36.916 --> 34:37.916
Ooh.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.500
Hello.

34:40.958 --> 34:41.833
Oh.

34:41.833 --> 34:42.916
Yeah.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.666
<i>Hermano.</i>

34:46.708 --> 34:48.166
Let's talk on the patio.

34:50.208 --> 34:53.000
I think better amidst the clouds
high above the city below.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.041
Exactly how high above the city are we?

34:56.041 --> 34:58.375
Eighty-six glorious stories.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.416
- Oh.
- I know.

34:59.416 --> 35:04.166
I make all my meaningful decisions here,
and giving up a Pentatonix ticket...

35:04.916 --> 35:08.500
Well, that could be
quite meaningful for us both.

35:08.500 --> 35:12.416
I know I'm going
to hate myself for this, but yes.

35:12.416 --> 35:13.541
Come, Teddy.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.958
- Okay.

35:25.958 --> 35:29.000
- Ooh.
- Oh wow, that's a keeper.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.166
Ooh-la-la. Hm!

35:32.625 --> 35:33.625
So,

35:34.333 --> 35:38.333
why does somebody need only one ticket
to a concert on Christmas Eve?

35:38.333 --> 35:41.041
Well, uh, let's just say

35:41.041 --> 35:44.333
it starts with my boyfriend
cheating on me before the holidays,

35:44.833 --> 35:48.958
and hopefully, ends with me meeting
the man of my dreams at a Pentatonix show.

35:48.958 --> 35:50.541
That is horrible.

35:50.541 --> 35:53.541
I mean, everybody knows
you wait until January to break up.

35:53.541 --> 35:55.208
- Mm-hm.
- And I so hate cheaters.

35:55.208 --> 35:56.458
Heh. Right?

35:57.333 --> 35:59.000
You may not believe this,

35:59.000 --> 36:02.375
but I'd be with Javi
even if he had nothing.

36:02.375 --> 36:06.375
Totally true because I was with him
when he had nothing.

36:06.916 --> 36:07.791
My point,

36:08.291 --> 36:10.250
money and things are fun,

36:10.250 --> 36:14.291
but finding the person
who values your heart

36:14.291 --> 36:16.416
as much as they value their own,

36:16.416 --> 36:19.458
that's the real key
to a loving relationship.

36:19.458 --> 36:24.208
But to find that, you have to determine
which values are truly important to you.

36:24.208 --> 36:27.916
- Seem to be hearing that a lot these days.
- You're missing something.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.458
This.

36:30.458 --> 36:33.291
No. No, I can't, um...

36:33.291 --> 36:36.375
You know, I'm more
of a Nordstrom Rack kind of girl.

36:36.375 --> 36:38.875
I don't even see myself
in a situation where I'd wear that.

36:39.791 --> 36:42.541
Aren't you planning to meet
the man of your dreams tomorrow night?

36:42.541 --> 36:47.166
Layla, Javier said we can have the ticket.
We gotta do something for him first, so...

36:47.166 --> 36:50.625
- It's time-sensitive. We gotta go.
- Okay, okay. Okay, uh...

36:51.125 --> 36:52.166
Here.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.958
- I can't.

36:53.958 --> 36:55.583
I insist.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.250
It's in your size.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.166
Think of it as a sign from the universe.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.291
Thank you.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.708
Okay.
- Ooh.

37:06.875 --> 37:07.708
Okay...

37:08.208 --> 37:09.083
Let's go.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.750
And if it doesn't work out
with that Pentatonix guy,

37:13.750 --> 37:16.750
that Teddy... quite adorable.

37:16.750 --> 37:17.666
Quite.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.708
Quite.
- Quite.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.666
Quite.
- Quite.

37:21.666 --> 37:22.583
Yes.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.000
Kind of uncomfortable?

37:24.000 --> 37:28.583
Okay, so it was a little intense
but also kind of sweet.

37:28.583 --> 37:29.666
- I mean...
- Well...

37:29.666 --> 37:32.666
Have you ever looked
at someone like that? Like, I don't know...

37:32.666 --> 37:37.791
Just like you're in a magic bubble,
like the whole world just disappears.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.333
I've never shared a look with anybody

37:40.333 --> 37:42.250
that made the five feet
around me disappear,

37:42.250 --> 37:43.958
let alone the whole world.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.875
If you're trying to get this ticket
that I risked my life for--

37:46.875 --> 37:48.083
Okay.

37:48.083 --> 37:51.083
I am sorry about the pepper spray.

37:51.083 --> 37:55.125
The pepper-- I'm not even ta--
You know what? We gotta keep moving.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.833
- Okay?
- All right. Okay, so how does this work?

37:57.833 --> 38:01.583
Well, apparently, we get the extra ticket
that he has for his mom

38:01.583 --> 38:04.833
if we can get him the one thing
he wants more than tickets to the concert.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.916
That wouldn't happen to be
for a Macklemore concert, right?

38:07.916 --> 38:11.666
- Because I do have those tickets.
- No, it's not a Macklemore concert.

38:12.166 --> 38:15.458
He wants us to get this Chanel purse.
I don't know.

38:15.458 --> 38:17.541
He's gonna pay for it.
We just gotta go pick it up.

38:17.541 --> 38:20.416
Okay, so basically,
we just have to run an errand?

38:20.416 --> 38:22.125
- Yeah,
- Okay, Teddy.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.541
You got skills.

38:24.583 --> 38:25.541
Guess I do.

38:27.875 --> 38:28.958
Okay.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.250
I got it.
Okay.

38:31.250 --> 38:34.875
Summer camp.
Okay, uh... Camp Carmel.

38:34.875 --> 38:37.708
Dang. I went to Camp Greenwood.

38:37.708 --> 38:40.708
Oh gosh, I am so hungry right now.
I'm starved.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.166
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

38:42.166 --> 38:46.333
You just had three bags of potato chips
and a warm pretzel at the bar.

38:46.333 --> 38:47.666
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

38:49.416 --> 38:50.333
Here.

38:51.791 --> 38:56.208
You just keep snacks in your coat?
My goodness, that is adorable.

38:56.791 --> 39:00.416
- I always keep some trail mix on me.
- Hold up. Are there peanuts in here?

39:00.416 --> 39:03.250
- Oh gosh, I'm severely allergic.

39:03.833 --> 39:05.833
No, you good. I made that myself.

39:06.333 --> 39:07.250
Okay.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.791
Man, what you doing?

39:13.833 --> 39:16.000
Wow. You know what? This is incredible.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.166
What's in this?

39:17.166 --> 39:22.333
Dry out my cranberries, add some cardamom,
and my personal favorite,

39:23.208 --> 39:25.291
crunchy quinoa, instead of peanuts.

39:25.291 --> 39:27.916
Um, okay, secret chef.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.875
Trust me. Trust me,
he's got granola skills.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.208
Yeah, have at it.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.125
Come on.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.750
- Terrible mime.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.958
A mime is a terrible thing to waste.

39:46.166 --> 39:49.625
- Twenty-nine hours to the concert.
- Right. Okay, what purse are we getting?

39:49.625 --> 39:53.083
Um, is it one of those quilted ones
with the chain? I really love those.

39:53.083 --> 39:55.708
- No, he said to get the Sugar Plum.
- Oh.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.291
You know that one?

39:57.291 --> 40:00.250
Mm. It just sounds special.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.041
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

40:02.041 --> 40:03.125
Look at this guy.

40:04.166 --> 40:05.708
Sir, do you have an appointment?

40:05.708 --> 40:08.833
For the store? No, we're here
to get a Sugar Plum, in and out.

40:08.833 --> 40:10.416
Sir.

40:11.291 --> 40:14.125
The Sugar Plum
is our limited-edition holiday release.

40:14.125 --> 40:18.625
If you don't have an appointment,
we kindly ask that you wait in line.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.166
Oh.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.666
I guess the Sugar Plum really is special.

40:24.166 --> 40:25.500
Well, buckle up.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.916
We'll get to know each other very well.

40:27.916 --> 40:29.666
- Okay.
- Thanks.

40:29.666 --> 40:33.250
So that's what you meant
by risking your life for my ticket?

40:33.250 --> 40:34.625
- Yes.
- Heights?

40:34.625 --> 40:36.666
Oh, that's so basic.

40:36.666 --> 40:38.458
- Basic?
- Yeah.

40:38.458 --> 40:41.000
I thought you were gonna say
something like, I don't know...

40:41.000 --> 40:42.041
something exotic,

40:42.041 --> 40:45.416
like jungle cats or tailored suits.

40:45.416 --> 40:49.000
Okay. Okay, Layla, I get it.
You want me to wear a suit.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.125
Fine.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.500
Gosh, well, let me ask you something.

40:53.125 --> 40:55.625
Why aren't you spending the holiday
with your family?

40:55.625 --> 40:56.541
Eh...

40:56.541 --> 40:58.833
My parents aren't really
into the holidays like that.

40:58.833 --> 40:59.750
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.875
My grandma was the one
that made Christmas Christmas,

41:01.875 --> 41:03.916
and she's not around anymore.

41:03.916 --> 41:05.000
Sorry.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.458
Yeah, me too.

41:07.416 --> 41:11.125
But I still celebrate in a big way.
It's just with my boyfriend.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.916
But you don't have a boyfriend.

41:13.916 --> 41:16.000
Which is exactly why I need this ticket.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.916
Good morning. Right this way.

41:20.750 --> 41:21.791
Welcome.

41:38.791 --> 41:39.958
It's Paris.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.541
Oh, I guess it is.
No, no, no.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.208
No, you don't understand.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.875
This is another sign.

41:45.875 --> 41:48.791
James and I talked about this.
It's our bucket list city.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.000
Does this come in two colors?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.791
Oh wow, we're getting so close.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.416
- I can't believe this is gonna work.
Wow.

41:55.416 --> 41:57.458
You must be new here.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.750
That's the only thing that explains
the way you're talking to me,

42:00.750 --> 42:05.500
and the fact that you think
that last year's lipstick color suits you.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.041
I'm so sorry, ma'am,

42:07.041 --> 42:10.541
but I've worked here for two years,
and this is store policy.

42:10.541 --> 42:13.875
So you're gonna have to wait in line
like the rest of our guests.

42:14.750 --> 42:18.041
- May I speak to a store manager, please?
- Excuse me, one second.

42:18.041 --> 42:20.458
Or literally anyone
that actually gives a--

42:20.458 --> 42:22.250
Hey. Hi. Hi.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.500
Hey, it's, um... Excuse me.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.833
It's the holiday season.
Why don't you give her a break?

42:27.833 --> 42:32.666
I'm sorry,
I don't take advice from youth pastors.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.125
What's wrong with khakis and a button-up?

42:36.125 --> 42:37.250
Would you like a list?

42:38.458 --> 42:41.375
- Oh, wow, you're rude.
- Ah--

42:41.375 --> 42:45.875
You know God loves those
who are polite and patient.

42:45.875 --> 42:47.416
So how about you get back in line?

42:47.416 --> 42:48.708
Oh--

42:48.708 --> 42:49.833
Line.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.875
- But--
- Line. Line.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.208
There's a line.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.833
Could you believe her?
- Thank you so much.

43:03.833 --> 43:04.750
For what?

43:04.750 --> 43:07.291
You were literally just doing a job,

43:07.791 --> 43:10.083
and she clearly
didn't take her pills this morning.

43:10.083 --> 43:11.375
Or she took all of them.

43:11.375 --> 43:12.625
My money's on all.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.166
Yeah, probably.
- Yeah.

43:15.041 --> 43:16.083
Well, thank you.

43:16.083 --> 43:18.833
Is there anything I can do for you?

43:18.833 --> 43:22.875
Uh, no, I'm just waiting in line
for a Sugar Plum like everyone else.

43:22.875 --> 43:24.041
Okay.

43:24.041 --> 43:27.250
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can help you with.

43:27.250 --> 43:28.291
Yes.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
She crazy.

43:36.666 --> 43:38.875
She crazy. She was nice, though.

43:39.666 --> 43:40.666
- Nice?
- Yeah.

43:40.666 --> 43:42.708
Mm. She was nice on you.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.541
What you saying?

43:44.541 --> 43:47.166
Teddy, you didn't see
the eye she was giving you?

43:47.166 --> 43:49.791
Come on. She was holding your elbow.

43:49.791 --> 43:51.750
Okay, she touched my elbow.

43:51.750 --> 43:54.958
A woman like that?
That works in the Chanel store? No way.

43:54.958 --> 43:58.750
Okay. Look, you need to go over to her
and get her number.

43:58.750 --> 44:01.125
I'm not going over just to get shut down.
You crazy.

44:01.125 --> 44:02.291
- Teddy!
- No.

44:02.291 --> 44:03.708
You are a total catch.

44:03.708 --> 44:06.458
- Your granola and your chivalry.

44:06.458 --> 44:09.208
- Okay.
Just gotta take a risk.

44:09.208 --> 44:11.000
Not really a risk type of guy.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.625
Well, you should be.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.250
Look, Teddy.

44:16.958 --> 44:19.458
Sometimes, a woman just wants
a man to just walk up to her

44:19.458 --> 44:21.958
and give her that look that says,

44:21.958 --> 44:24.708
"I know you are
ridiculously out of my league,

44:24.708 --> 44:29.083
but you're just too amazing
to not give a shot."

44:33.333 --> 44:34.500
That's the look.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.416
- Oh.

44:35.416 --> 44:37.541
What? Use it. Okay, just get over there.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.833
- I'm not-- No...
- Get her number. Do it.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.291
- Okay.
- Thank you.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.833
- Man...

44:49.791 --> 44:50.625
Oh.

44:52.041 --> 44:55.666
Um, excuse me, sir,
I think you dropped your phone.

44:56.583 --> 44:58.333
Oh, thank you.

44:58.333 --> 45:01.750
Ah, after I buy this purse,
there's no money for a new phone.

45:01.750 --> 45:03.458
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Yeah.

45:03.458 --> 45:06.125
It's for my mom. She was really sick.

45:06.125 --> 45:09.041
- Timmy, we don't need to--
- She was.

45:09.541 --> 45:10.875
It was really scary.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.625
- Oh.

45:12.625 --> 45:14.750
Uh, sorry, but, uh...

45:14.750 --> 45:16.791
Well, we almost lost her.

45:17.583 --> 45:21.791
And you realize
the next moment's not promised.

45:22.583 --> 45:26.125
So, I'm going to give her
everything I can while I can.

45:27.083 --> 45:30.208
Well, it's, uh, quite a blessing
that you can get that for her.

45:30.208 --> 45:33.583
You better move up.
Don't want you to lose your place.

45:35.375 --> 45:37.833
- Uh, merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you too.

45:45.875 --> 45:47.000
I got news.

45:47.958 --> 45:50.916
Apparently,
there’s only one Sugar Plum left,

45:50.916 --> 45:53.416
and Michaela is going to sneak it for us.

45:54.666 --> 45:55.708
Yes...

45:56.791 --> 45:58.000
I can't take it.

45:58.583 --> 45:59.500
Hm?

46:00.083 --> 46:03.833
- Someone else deserves it more than me.
- What? Who?

46:04.916 --> 46:06.708
There's a guy back there with his son.

46:08.291 --> 46:12.541
So? We need that purse.
We need it for the ticket.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.708
It's my job, Layla.

46:15.416 --> 46:16.625
It's your person.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.583
It's everything
we've been talking about all day.

46:21.958 --> 46:25.708
- You gotta be kidding me. Are you serious?
- Here are your gloves, sir.

46:25.708 --> 46:28.208
- Um, Michaela-- No, I'm...
- Thank you. Are you--?

46:28.208 --> 46:30.125
- I'm sorry, Michaela.
Mm-mm.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.625
I really appreciate it.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.250
- But this belongs to someone else.
Oh.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.583
No, no, no, these are gloves.

46:37.583 --> 46:40.625
We're all sold out of Sugar Plums,
other than the display.

46:40.625 --> 46:42.791
What? Sold out?

46:42.791 --> 46:44.666
That display is mine!

47:07.500 --> 47:08.875
- Come on, chin up.

47:09.375 --> 47:10.875
Still got 29 hours.

47:13.583 --> 47:15.625
Guys! Teddy got the purse!

47:15.625 --> 47:17.833
Oh, no way!
Oh.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.916
But Layla decided to give it to some guy.

47:20.916 --> 47:22.750
What? Lame, Layla.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.333
More like lame-la, am I right?

47:24.333 --> 47:25.666
Nice.
- Thanks.

47:25.666 --> 47:29.375
He said he needed it for his wife
because they have a beautiful love story.

47:29.375 --> 47:31.583
- Oh, okay. I mean, that's sweet.
- Oh. Mm.

47:31.583 --> 47:36.500
Now he's just sending multiple messages
about how sweet and selfless Layla is.

47:37.958 --> 47:39.125
Wait.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.333
Guys.

47:40.333 --> 47:43.416
- You don't think...?
- That Teddy has a crush on Layla.

47:43.416 --> 47:45.000
Yeah!
He so does.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.208
That changes everything.

47:46.208 --> 47:51.125
No, I know. We've been on Team Lames
when we could have been on Team Tayla.

47:51.125 --> 47:55.708
Exactly! If she's meant to be with Teddy,
she can't spend Christmas Eve with James.

47:55.708 --> 47:57.000
Or you know what?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.666
I kind of feel like
after such a brutal breakup,

47:59.666 --> 48:01.708
she should really
take some time for herself,

48:01.708 --> 48:03.958
to kind of connect with herself and heal.

48:03.958 --> 48:07.541
- I read this book by Brené Brown once...
- Scott, please.

48:07.541 --> 48:10.750
I'll read one quote. I wanna get it right.
I'll pull it up quick.

48:10.750 --> 48:12.541
I'm gonna go.

48:12.541 --> 48:14.583
Basically she talks about...

48:14.583 --> 48:16.583
Have you seen the view from the balcony?

48:16.583 --> 48:19.458
Here. Quick, quick.
- Oh my God.

48:19.458 --> 48:21.791
Oh. That's okay. I'll tell y'all later.

48:24.916 --> 48:27.208
<i>Girl, I can't believe
you gave up the purse.</i>

48:27.208 --> 48:31.041
<i>Why did you do that?
That bag was the key to your love story.</i>

48:31.041 --> 48:32.750
Okay. Roxy, you don't understand.

48:32.750 --> 48:34.958
You had to hear this kid
and his dad's story.

48:34.958 --> 48:38.625
<i>I'd still have kept the purse.
That's the difference between you and me.</i>

48:39.125 --> 48:41.750
<i>I'm going to keep doing
what I can on my end.</i>

48:42.375 --> 48:44.666
<i>We're getting you to that show. Bye.</i>

48:45.250 --> 48:46.250
Okay, bye.

48:47.208 --> 48:50.791
You know, if I get a vote,
I'd have to say I'm Team Roxy on this one.

48:50.791 --> 48:52.458
You and Roxy are not allowed to be

48:52.458 --> 48:54.708
more upset than me
about not having this ticket.

48:54.708 --> 48:56.958
My actual job is on the line, so...

48:58.166 --> 48:59.958
I know, and I'm sorry.

48:59.958 --> 49:03.291
If you would've heard their story,
then you would understand.

49:04.625 --> 49:07.833
Must have been a special story
for you to give up on your dream guy.

49:07.833 --> 49:11.500
Yeah, well... I'm starting to wonder
if it's all even worth it.

49:12.333 --> 49:13.500
Excuse me?

49:14.916 --> 49:18.125
We have gone all around town
trying to get this ticket.

49:18.125 --> 49:19.791
All we run into is disappointment.

49:19.791 --> 49:23.916
Maybe the universe is trying to tell me
it doesn't want me to be at the concert.

49:24.416 --> 49:25.583
What?

49:25.583 --> 49:27.791
I will give you
a crazy good review, I promise.

49:27.791 --> 49:30.333
Oh! What about your person?

49:30.333 --> 49:32.166
I don't know.

49:32.166 --> 49:36.000
If James and I were truly meant to be,
would it really be this hard?

49:36.500 --> 49:37.333
Are you--?

49:37.958 --> 49:42.875
I don't know. Maybe the universe is trying
to test you to see if you really want it.

49:43.375 --> 49:46.208
What I do know
is that we're not stopping, okay?

49:46.208 --> 49:48.291
Hm.

49:48.291 --> 49:49.541
Wait, wait, wait.

49:51.458 --> 49:52.958
Flight attendants.

49:52.958 --> 49:55.291
You met James in an airport,

49:55.291 --> 49:57.666
and now we're randomly
seeing flight attendants?

49:58.166 --> 49:59.375
It's a sign, Layla.

50:00.625 --> 50:03.541
It's also a stretch, even for me.

50:03.541 --> 50:06.541
- Come on.
- But I do like where your head is at.

50:08.166 --> 50:09.458
We need more of that.

50:10.833 --> 50:13.333
More what? Flight attendants?

50:13.333 --> 50:14.291
No.

50:14.791 --> 50:15.875
Change of headspace.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.041
This is definitely a change of headspace.

50:21.458 --> 50:22.875
Pretty lights.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.208
Pretty...

50:26.250 --> 50:27.083
park.

50:28.500 --> 50:31.333
- Okay. Where we going?
Harlem. Roxy's.

50:31.333 --> 50:34.416
- This is just a fun way to get there.
Okay.

50:34.416 --> 50:36.583
- Wait a minute.

50:36.583 --> 50:37.666
You hear that?

50:38.333 --> 50:39.208
What?

50:39.708 --> 50:40.708
The subtle beat.

50:41.458 --> 50:43.750
It sounds like
my favorite Pentatonix song.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.291
Stop it.

50:46.291 --> 50:48.000
Wait, you're a fan?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.541
What, you think you're the only person
up on Pentatonix?

50:50.541 --> 50:51.875
Come on.

50:51.875 --> 50:55.666
Teddy, I mean,
this whole time, you never really said,

50:55.666 --> 50:58.875
"Hello, Layla. Guess what?
I'm a Pentatonix fan too."

50:58.875 --> 51:01.500
You are so full of surprises.

51:02.083 --> 51:03.958
- Gotta keep you on your toes.
- Hm.

51:03.958 --> 51:05.000
Check this out.

51:11.166 --> 51:12.333
It's my favorite.

51:12.333 --> 51:13.791
It's my favorite too.

51:13.791 --> 51:15.541
- You know how to do it?
- Yeah, you?

51:15.541 --> 51:16.791
Okay. Okay.

51:16.791 --> 51:19.500
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ♪</i>

51:19.500 --> 51:22.166

- That time--
- Are you serious?

51:25.208 --> 51:27.750
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- You are so dangerous.

51:27.750 --> 51:29.250

52:06.750 --> 52:09.000
- Mm. Oh. Okay, okay.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.750
You guys,
I think we've had enough wine.

52:11.750 --> 52:14.333
It's time to start figuring out
how to get this ticket.

52:14.333 --> 52:17.958
- Teddy!
- Girl, you can never have enough wine.

52:17.958 --> 52:20.333
- And leave that man alone.
- Girl, why?

52:21.166 --> 52:24.250
- How long does it take to make a sandwich?
- Forget the sandwich.

52:24.250 --> 52:28.916
Teddy has found pots and spices
I never knew I had or what to do with.

52:28.916 --> 52:30.333
We are about to feast.

52:31.291 --> 52:35.000
So, I figured some nourishment
would get our brains going.

52:36.166 --> 52:38.708
So I got meat, and I got vegan.

52:39.458 --> 52:40.875
And you got some arms.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.500
Got a little hot in there.

52:45.291 --> 52:46.500
Kind of hot in here.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.125
I was just looking at the meat.

52:51.125 --> 52:52.458
Mm-hm.

52:52.458 --> 52:54.333
- On the plate.
- Right.

53:01.458 --> 53:04.208
Boy, you got skills.

53:04.208 --> 53:07.291
Oh...
- Layla, does he have skills?

53:08.291 --> 53:10.208
- Um... Teddy.

53:10.875 --> 53:15.416
Apologies to my mama,
but this was the best meal ever.

53:15.416 --> 53:18.666
Thanks.
Well, I used to work at Alinea, so...

53:18.666 --> 53:20.916
- Shut up! Alinea?
- Mm-hm.

53:20.916 --> 53:22.250
Michelin star-rated Alinea?

53:23.375 --> 53:24.625
Layla, we were just there.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.333
Yeah, my birthday. Last spring.

53:27.333 --> 53:29.166
It was incredible.

53:29.166 --> 53:30.583
Uh, the sea bass...

53:30.583 --> 53:32.916
Wait a minute,
I was still there last spring.

53:32.916 --> 53:35.083
I probably cooked you that sea bass.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.250
Okay, Teddy, you have a gift.

53:37.916 --> 53:40.500
- Hm.
- Why aren't you still cooking?

53:41.750 --> 53:45.208
Well, um, life happens.

53:45.208 --> 53:47.291
You know, um, my mom got sick.

53:47.916 --> 53:50.166
They needed me
to come back home and help, so...

53:50.708 --> 53:53.291
Chef jobs aren't typically flexible, so...

53:54.291 --> 53:55.166
Concierge.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.541
You are a good son, Teddy,

53:58.208 --> 54:00.208
but you not cooking
is a culinary travesty.

54:00.208 --> 54:04.666
Thank you, but the concierge
in me knows it's gonna take more than fate

54:04.666 --> 54:07.291
to get this very deserving woman
her tickets, so...

54:12.958 --> 54:14.041
Or maybe not.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.375
My cousin said
he has two Pentatonix tickets.

54:18.375 --> 54:21.833
All we gotta do is pick 'em up.
They're at my mom's house in Brooklyn.

54:21.833 --> 54:22.958
Ah--

54:42.791 --> 54:45.458
Ooh, took you long enough.
Uh, we don't have much time.

54:45.458 --> 54:47.791
What? How much time could it take...

54:48.458 --> 54:49.291
to get a ticket?

54:49.875 --> 54:51.125
Uh, it's...

54:51.833 --> 54:53.791
It's a bit more complicated.

54:55.416 --> 54:56.333
Complicated?

54:56.333 --> 54:59.500
I'll explain. Just pay attention
and follow my lead, okay? Come on.

54:59.500 --> 55:03.416
Jordy, let him get in the house
before you start barking orders.

55:03.416 --> 55:06.125
Jordy, what complications?

55:06.125 --> 55:08.208
Teddy, it's about time you got home.

55:08.208 --> 55:10.791
I need you to get these <i>brûlées</i> done,

55:10.791 --> 55:14.208
so I can finish my gift giveaways
for my friends and neighbors.

55:14.208 --> 55:16.500
Um, excuse me. Who's barking orders?

55:16.500 --> 55:18.000
I'm his mother. I can bark what--

55:18.000 --> 55:20.083
- I'm sorry, they do this all the time--
- Ooh!

55:20.083 --> 55:21.041
It's okay.

55:21.041 --> 55:22.000
Teddy.

55:22.875 --> 55:24.208
Who's this?

55:24.208 --> 55:27.083
This is Layla. She-- Oh no, no, no.

55:27.083 --> 55:29.958
I can see the look.
She's one of my clients.

55:29.958 --> 55:33.125
She was just expecting a <i>ticket</i>
when we walked in the door.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.625
- Breathe. I will make this happen.
- Don't you tell me--

55:35.625 --> 55:37.083
We have a guest.

55:38.125 --> 55:41.333
- Pleasure to meet you, Layla.
- It's a pleasure to meet you too...

55:41.333 --> 55:43.791
- Auntie, I need to get them to--
Jordy.

55:43.791 --> 55:48.041
Whatever scheme you have can wait
until after proper introductions.

55:48.041 --> 55:49.958
Scheme. I'm so sorry.

55:49.958 --> 55:52.458
Layla, this is Teddy's cousin, Jordy.

55:52.458 --> 55:53.625
Hi.

55:53.625 --> 55:56.875
Hello! Okay, so now
that we all know each other,

55:56.875 --> 56:00.416
can I please put them to work,
so they rehearse and win these tickets?

56:00.416 --> 56:01.416
- Rehearse?
- Rehearse?

56:06.583 --> 56:10.291
You expect me to lip-sync and dance
at the Snow Ball?

56:10.291 --> 56:11.625
What's the Snow Ball?

56:11.625 --> 56:15.125
The lip-sync battle
to end all lip-sync battles,

56:15.125 --> 56:18.708
and this year,
the winners get Pentatonix tickets.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.750
Sounds like fun!

56:20.416 --> 56:21.250
For who?

56:21.833 --> 56:23.708
Layla, you do not understand.

56:23.708 --> 56:25.958
Okay, he wants us to compete.

56:25.958 --> 56:29.125
And these people go hard
and take it way too serious.

56:29.125 --> 56:31.625
- Teddy tends to exaggerate.
- I t--

56:32.375 --> 56:33.833
Okay. Okay.

56:34.458 --> 56:38.541
Last year's runner-up slashed
the winner's tires in a fit of rage.

56:38.541 --> 56:41.041
- Because he came in second place?
- Yes.

56:41.041 --> 56:43.750
- Well, I hope they banned him.
Yes!

56:43.750 --> 56:46.041
For a year. But I was robbed, okay?

56:46.041 --> 56:47.500
Wait, it was you?

56:47.500 --> 56:49.875
And it was only <i>one</i> tire.

56:49.875 --> 56:52.583
I can be a bit... competitive.

56:53.583 --> 56:58.500
But that is what is going to help you
win these tickets, understand?

56:58.500 --> 57:01.916
- This is not going to be a cakewalk.

57:01.916 --> 57:05.000
This is the Snow Ball.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.791
It is an institution.

57:06.791 --> 57:10.166
The competition
are not Housewives of Canarsie.

57:10.166 --> 57:12.708
These are understudies
from <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>

57:12.708 --> 57:15.166
and runners-up from <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

57:15.166 --> 57:18.291
OMG. Okay, drag queens really bring it.

57:18.291 --> 57:21.875
Hey, guys, did I mention
that I really don't want to do this?

57:21.875 --> 57:23.500
And my crippling stage fright?

57:23.500 --> 57:24.833
Teddy, don't even play.

57:24.833 --> 57:27.416
He was Little Mister Wildwood
for two years straight.

57:27.416 --> 57:29.375
- Little Mister... what?

57:29.375 --> 57:31.166
- Mm-hm.
Wait, wait, wait.

57:32.250 --> 57:35.708
- You were in pageants?
- Oh my God, we are not talking about this.

57:35.708 --> 57:37.208
I was six years old!

57:37.208 --> 57:39.458
All right, at some point,
we're gonna talk about this.

57:39.458 --> 57:40.833
Okay, listen!

57:41.666 --> 57:47.208
I am going to need you to give me
your mind, body, and soul

57:47.208 --> 57:49.541
for the next 12 hours.

57:49.541 --> 57:51.916
Twelve hours? Come on, Jordy!

57:51.916 --> 57:53.875
Okay, yeah, that is kind of long, right?

57:53.875 --> 57:55.958
- Fourteen hours!
- Fourteen?

57:55.958 --> 57:58.666
If you do, you <i>might</i>

57:59.500 --> 58:01.916
have a shot at winning those tickets.

58:01.916 --> 58:06.458
Now, prepare to sass and sparkle!

58:06.458 --> 58:07.375
Mm-hm!

58:09.166 --> 58:12.625
Let's test your ability.
Five, six, seven, eight!

58:12.625 --> 58:15.791
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and eight.

58:15.791 --> 58:18.791
One and two and three and four,
five, six, your turn!

58:18.791 --> 58:21.958
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and eight.

58:21.958 --> 58:25.041
One and two and three and four,
next up! Let's go!

58:25.041 --> 58:28.166
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and eight.

58:28.166 --> 58:31.625
One and two and three and four,
that's not right! It goes like this!

58:31.625 --> 58:35.750
This! This! This! This! This!
This! This! This! This! This!

58:35.750 --> 58:37.208
That's how you do it!

58:37.208 --> 58:41.541
All right, we need some type of spectacle
to really set things off in there.

58:41.541 --> 58:43.791
So I was thinking
we could do this lift, okay?

58:43.791 --> 58:45.208
I'm gonna tell you how to do it.

58:45.208 --> 58:46.333
- Okay.
- So come on.

58:46.333 --> 58:49.583
- All right.
- Stand there. Put your hands on her waist.

58:49.583 --> 58:51.000
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.250
So, um... you.

58:53.250 --> 58:56.625
You are going
to put your hands on her waist.

58:56.625 --> 58:59.791
So you want to pli-- Hands on her waist!

58:59.791 --> 59:02.041
Hand. The whole time.
Leave them there!

59:02.041 --> 59:03.875
The whole time.
Do not move!

59:03.875 --> 59:06.333
The whole time? We hear.
Yes! Yes.

59:06.333 --> 59:09.083
Now take your hands and grab his wrist.

59:09.083 --> 59:11.208
- Okay.
- That's gonna help support you, okay?

59:11.208 --> 59:13.708
This is what you need to do.
So you're gonna plié.

59:13.708 --> 59:16.416
Plié down, right? Just like this.

59:17.625 --> 59:19.083
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.958
So you are-- That's too much.

59:20.958 --> 59:23.166
The butt. No, keep the butt in.

59:23.166 --> 59:25.500
- Down! Shoulder! Up!
- I got it!

59:25.500 --> 59:26.833
Down, shoulder, up!

59:26.833 --> 59:28.250
- I got it.
- Where's the girl?

59:28.250 --> 59:30.166
Where's the girl? Where's the girl?

59:30.166 --> 59:33.291
How you gonna go down, shoulder, up
if you don't have her on your shoulder?

59:33.291 --> 59:34.458
That's not what I was doing.

59:34.458 --> 59:38.041
Teddy... We've done this many times.
Go ahead, grab my hand, like you know.

59:38.041 --> 59:42.375
Okay, here we go. So we're gonna
turn, turn, turn, boom, grab my leg.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.333
Boop!

59:43.333 --> 59:47.291
Five, six, seven, eight.
One and two and three and four-- Oh!

59:47.291 --> 59:48.500
- Teddy!
- Wha--!

59:49.541 --> 59:51.416
Five, six, seven, eight.

59:51.416 --> 59:52.791
One, two, three.

59:52.791 --> 59:53.708
Oh!

59:53.708 --> 59:54.666
Shoot.

59:54.666 --> 59:55.750
- Oh, Teddy.

59:59.208 --> 01:00:01.875
Yes! Dip! Dip! Yes!

01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:04.083
We did it.

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:05.375
Teddy Wilkins.

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:07.625
Mom.
- My crème brûlées?

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.083
Do you think we'll get
another rehearsal in?

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:13.875
Yeah, it shouldn't take that long.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:28.541
Sriracha.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.875
And crème brûlées?

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:31.500
- No.
- No.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.125
No, you.

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:35.791
At the airport lounge.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.541
You put Sriracha on my quiche.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:41.916
You dropped one of these in my purse.

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.291
You see? I told you I never forget a face.

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:53.083
Especially a pretty one.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:58.041
- Just saying.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:59.666
I guess you were right.

01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:02.125
I guess I was.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:07.625
Let me get started with this,
so that we can get back to rehearsing.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.541
I wish I could help.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.125
Oh, you can.

01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:12.583
No.

01:01:13.083 --> 01:01:14.875
I'm a disaster in the kitchen.

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:16.791
Well, that's nonsense.

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:18.250

You really need
to open your own restaurant,

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:27.583
so I can become a regular.

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:29.291
- I am not opening a restaurant.

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:31.666
You know how many new restaurants
open and close in a year?

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:32.958
Not yours.

01:02:34.875 --> 01:02:36.291
Thanks for that, but, uh,

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:39.541
I don't have the same confidence
in the universe as you do.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:43.333
Mm, fine. You don't have to have
the same confidence in the universe, but

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.291
maybe that kind of confidence in yourself.

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:48.500
Is that how you motivate your students?

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.625
Yes, and sometimes their parents.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:53.666
They feel that
they don't have a shot at college.

01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:56.750
So whether it's money, circumstance,

01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:00.416
fear, it leaves
too many reluctant to dream.

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.875
Preach, child.

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:03.250
Oh, Mom.

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:06.791
Teddy, I'm not sick anymore.

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:12.541
I love having you here,
but I don't need you here.

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:18.000
It's time that you stop worrying about me
and get back to your life.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.291
Um, eating crème brûlée
and having heart-to-hearts

01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:23.166
is not getting you that ticket.
Let's get back at it. Come on.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.041
Okay, well...
- Yeah. Uh-uh!

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:28.083
One more bite.
- Less sass, more sparkle.

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:29.833
I'm going.
- Let's go. Come on.

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:45.750
What are you waiting on?

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:51.000
I know it sounds crazy,
but she just looks so peaceful, don't she?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.458
She won't be peaceful
if she doesn't get these tickets.

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:55.541
No, no!
Wakey-wakey!

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:02.166
Hi, baby.

01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:04.333
I'm sorry, was I drooling or something?

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.750
No...
- Did I snore too loud?

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.375
It's just that we have
a show to prepare for

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:11.583
and no time to waste
if we want to make you beautiful.

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:15.333
- Jordy, this girl is already beautiful.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:18.791
Snow Ball beautiful
ain't early morning beautiful.

01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:20.958
Honey, meet your glam squad.

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:25.541

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:38.125
Ooh, girl, the competition looks steep.

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:40.833
Oh, uh, hey!

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:43.125
- Let me get one of these.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah! No.

01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:45.333
Okay, you could've just asked.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:49.416
I know that catering company.
I can guarantee you this has nuts in it.

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:51.208
- Oh.
- Thank you.

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:53.208
Stabbing you in the heart with an EpiPen

01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:56.958
is not something I wanna add to the list
of insane things we've done together.

01:05:56.958 --> 01:06:00.625
Oh wow, but that's not
where you stick an EpiPen.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.250
But thank you for remembering.

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:07.000
- Merry Christmas, baby girl.
- Oh, mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.541

of your effervescence to win this contest.

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:20.791
You've been Snow Ball-blackballed.

01:06:20.791 --> 01:06:21.958
I made fliers.

01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:25.625
Ooh, that is a terrible picture of me.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.416
I know.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:31.958
Well, Alan, despite your little attempts
to dull my shine,

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:36.208
you can't crush my Christmas spirit
because today I'm here as a coach.

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:37.416
Ha!

01:06:37.416 --> 01:06:38.958
Who are you coaching?

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:40.541
Layla and Teddy.

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:43.708
They are one of the hottest new teams
from the Gowanus circuit.

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:48.458
More like the "go on back home" circuit,
but good luck.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
- Let's go get you ready.
Mm-hm.

01:07:12.541 --> 01:07:15.333
Yeah. You know what we got
that they don't got?

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:16.250
What?

01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:18.458
A former Little Mister Wildwood.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:22.625
That was in front of 25 parents
in the rec center.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:24.541
These people are expecting a show.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.916
Well, let's give them a show.

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:28.958
- All right, you're up. Listen.

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:31.166
You don't have coordination,
rhythm, or raw talent.

01:07:31.166 --> 01:07:32.916
So if you're gonna get these tickets,

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:34.916
you have to sass
and sparkle your butts off.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.333
Sass and sparkle.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:40.458
That was definitely steamy,
don't you think?

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:41.916
- Round of applause!
- Well...

01:07:41.916 --> 01:07:45.625
Wait, Teddy, your phone.
No falling phones to ruin my choreography.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:46.791
- Got you.
Mm-hm.

01:07:47.291 --> 01:07:48.333
Come on, cuz.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.916
- Y'all do this right.
- Let's do this.

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.166
Sass and sparkle...

01:07:54.166 --> 01:07:58.166

- Go. Go, go, go.

01:10:35.208 --> 01:10:36.750
All right.

01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:39.750
Oh, that way.

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:42.708
Weren't they great, everyone?

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:45.791
My God.

01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:49.458
That was so...

01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:52.625
That was-- That was so...

01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:54.166
- Incredi--
Okay!

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:58.833
So, a lot of those moves weren't mine,
and I'll be mad about that later,

01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:01.208
but that kiss was brilliant.

01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:03.083
Oh my God, you sold it!

01:11:03.083 --> 01:11:05.500
Listen, the Snow Ball has never seen
that kind of heat,

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.375
and if I didn't know better,
I'd say y'all was really in love.

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:10.583
- Okay?
- That's facts! Y'all really sold it.

01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:12.791
Yeah, that was...

01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:15.750
Uh, yeah. We really, um, sold it, right?

01:11:16.333 --> 01:11:18.541
I mean, yeah.
I mean, anything for the act, right?

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.541
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:11:21.291 --> 01:11:25.708
All right, everyone. It's prize time!

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:30.333
As always, our winners have been selected

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:33.541
based on my expert assessment
of their performance

01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:35.833
and the crowd's response.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.958
So, without further <i>adieu,</i>

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:41.166
will our top three performers
please join me on stage?

01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.958
In no particular order,

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:46.166
- Patrice and Tyler!

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:50.791
- Priyanka!

01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:53.500
And Layla and Teddy!

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.500
Oh my God!

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.000
Slap me on the behind and call me Rudolph!
Because this is a Christmas miracle!

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.916
- Girl, get up there! Go on!
Hello? Guys?

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.458
Layla and Teddy?

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:06.250
Don't be shy, you two! Layla and Teddy!

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:09.916
So, in third place,

01:12:09.916 --> 01:12:14.708
you may recognize them
from <i>In the Heights</i>, the regional tour.

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:16.750
Patrice and Tyler!

01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:22.125
Well done. Well done. Here you go.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:26.083
Oh!

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:27.875
And in second place,

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:30.250
our dark horse from Gowanus,

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:33.125
- Layla and Teddy!

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:39.958
Wow. I didn't know you had it in ya.
Well done, good stuff.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:43.416
Which means that the winner
of this year's Snow Ball is...

01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:45.625
Slay her name, Priyanka!

01:12:47.916 --> 01:12:50.291
This is my moment. Get away. Get away.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:55.666
- Yes!
Darling, you did it!

01:12:55.666 --> 01:12:59.333
- I love Christmas!

01:13:00.166 --> 01:13:03.416
Thank you! Thank you! Yeah!

01:13:04.208 --> 01:13:05.041
Guys, look.

01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.875
<i>In second place,</i>

01:13:06.875 --> 01:13:10.041
<i>the dark horse from Gowanus,
Layla and Teddy!</i>

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.833
- I can't believe they lost.
- Uh, I can.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:14.291
Did you see Priyanka?

01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:16.375
Now that was a slay... bell.

01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:18.458
Nice.
- Thank you.

01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:20.375
That was intense.

01:13:20.375 --> 01:13:23.666
So that's it, you guys.
Their last chance of getting a ticket.

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:27.750
I mean, yeah, tickets are sold out.
We don't have any more backstage passes.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.041
Maybe it's for the best.

01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:31.875
Clearly there's something going on
between those two.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:34.666
I just can't believe
she's never going to see James again.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.833
I thought you were Team Tayla.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:40.625
I don't know. I don't know how I feel.
This is a very confusing situation.

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:43.083
No, I agree.
I'm actually glad we don't have a ticket.

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:44.833
We would not know what to do with it.

01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:48.000

One of the industry comps canceled.
I put it in my morning email blast.

01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:58.208
- Uh-- Uh-- Oh!
- Oh!

01:13:58.208 --> 01:14:00.208

Okay, okay, okay. Guys, chill. Okay?

01:14:02.416 --> 01:14:04.750
So we can give Layla a ticket.

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.125
- Yes.
Great!

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.000
We can, but we shouldn't.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.625
Not because my five aunts are out
in the freezing cold looking for tickets,

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:14.208
but because I just don't think
it's a good idea to interfere.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:18.750
I agree. I think she should be with Teddy,
and James is just a distraction.

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.250
- But do we know that?
- Guys, guys, guys!

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.458
- This isn't our decision to make.

01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:27.666
Maybe she's supposed to be with James.
Maybe with Teddy.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:31.333
Point is, Layla has to decide.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.291
- Mm.

01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:35.291
- Fine.
- That's boring, but okay.

01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:38.791

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:03.958
Right.

01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:09.750
Because I was...

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.000
Okay, y'all should not feel bad.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.750
I know you didn't win the ticket,
but coming in second, with this crowd?

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.125
I still can't believe it.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:22.166
Hm! Honestly, based on your performance,
neither can I.

01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:26.916
But... you did sass and sparkle.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.541
Now, I believe that this gift certificate
to a spa weekend in the Catskills

01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:32.791
belongs to me.

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:33.750

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:35.750
Come on, girl,
second place makes me thirsty.

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:42.333
So, just me, or was there...?

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:44.208
Something that...

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.708
Kind of...

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.125
Happened?

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:48.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.291
- Up there.
Yeah.

01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:54.708
Um...

01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:58.250
'Cause, I mean--

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.958
Whatever this is, it's gonna have to wait.
You got a ticket.

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:02.500
- A ticket?
Yeah.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.583
- To Pentatonix. They sent us a ticket.

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:06.541
They-- How?

01:16:06.541 --> 01:16:09.833
They sent a text to your phone!
You need to get ready.

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:12.791
Uh, but he-- I mean...

01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:15.041
We were just thinking...

01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:17.291
That we should talk.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:20.125
Talk after this woman
goes to meet the love of her life.

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:22.416
Honey, I feel love's magic.

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:25.375
You have made me a believer.

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.625
Go and get her dressed
and get her to that theater. Okay?

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:28.916
Come on.

01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:30.541
Uh, you too, move.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:32.000
Wait. Why I gotta go?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.916
Well, in order to get Layla her ticket,

01:16:33.916 --> 01:16:36.916
Pentatonix said that you had to agree
to play Santa in the performance.

01:16:36.916 --> 01:16:38.000
- Wait, what?
Why?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.041
I don't know.
Maybe their regular guy's sick.

01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:43.791
- Who cares? Just go! Come on!
- I don't see-- There's nowhere on here--

01:16:44.916 --> 01:16:47.291
- Okay.
- Wait. What if I'm rushing into things?

01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:49.458
Girl, you are gonna meet
the man of your dreams,

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:50.625
and you're in shock.

01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:53.208
But you got the Pentatonix tickets!

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.708
Airport James, here you come.

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.541
Jordy. I can't! I can't!
I have stage fright.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.458
Fool, you just danced onstage.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.458
Yeah, but Santa has lines of dialogue.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:15.166
"Ho-ho-ho" isn't dialogue, it's a noise.
I know you know how to make a noise!

01:17:15.166 --> 01:17:19.375
- Yeah, but my belly isn't even jolly--
- Teddy! Your client is counting on you.

01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:23.416
Do your job, get to this theater,
and be a good Santa.

01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:26.000
Don't you go messing up
this lovely woman's happily ever after.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.166
Now go!

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.625
- Don't be grabbing--
- Go!

01:17:32.458 --> 01:17:35.666
Girl, you know I am not
into magic romance-type stuff.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:38.708
But this is some magic romance-type stuff.

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:42.291
You gonna tell me
why you acting so uncertain?

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:43.958
I'm not acting uncertain.

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:45.833
I'm just not...

01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:47.958
sure.

01:17:47.958 --> 01:17:51.875
Not sure, uncertain.
Do you need me to get you a dictionary?

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:56.416
Oh, it's an email from Impromptu.
They're asking for a review.

01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:57.708
I have to do this.

01:17:57.708 --> 01:18:00.375
- No, Teddy's job is on the line.
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:01.875
I type. You contour.

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:03.458
Go ahead.

01:18:05.416 --> 01:18:08.875
"Did you find your concierge courteous?"
Yes.

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:11.625
Teddy was very professional
and accommodating.

01:18:11.625 --> 01:18:14.708
And he was also really sweet.

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:17.958
He taught me how to make crème brûlée,
and you know that I can't cook.

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:20.750
You cannot,
and I don't see how that's relevant.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:22.333
- Can you focus, please?
- Okay.

01:18:22.916 --> 01:18:25.875
"Would you recommend this concierge
to a friend or colleague?"

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:28.500
Well, he pulled some wild cards.

01:18:29.166 --> 01:18:30.208
Like the Snow Ball.

01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:33.625
I mean, I don't think
I know anyone else in this world

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.166
who ever would've made that happen.

01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:38.875
I mean, I don't think
it's in a concierge's job description

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.958
to be a semi-professional dancer.

01:18:42.416 --> 01:18:43.875
And pretty good kisser.

01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:49.500
Well, this is a yes or no question,
so I'm gonna say yes.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.958
Oh!

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.916
- Oh, man!

01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:21.875
This day just gets better and--

01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:24.125
Oh! No!

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.541
Come on!

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:31.666
This was not in the job description.

01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:52.791
Hi, I'm Teddy, man.
I'm here to play Santa.

01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:55.625
Nice try, bud. They got a Santa.

01:19:55.625 --> 01:19:57.000
But I got a text though.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.458
Tito, I got this.

01:19:58.458 --> 01:19:59.750
- Teddy?
- Yeah.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.125
Right this way.

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:09.625
This way.

01:20:10.708 --> 01:20:13.083
All right, not really sure
what they have planned.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:16.125
- Oh my God, is that Kirstin?
Uh, yep, that would be her.

01:20:16.125 --> 01:20:18.375
And Mitch!
Mm-hm. Her and him.

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:20.250
- It's Kevin!
Yeah.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:23.041
- Oh, snap! There goes Matt.
- Yeah, well aware.

01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:25.208
Oh my God, this is too much.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:26.625
Where's Scott?

01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:28.750
Who's asking?
- Oh!

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:32.666
I'm just kidding.
You guys, Santa Claus has arrived.

01:20:32.666 --> 01:20:34.291
Oh, hey!
Oh, Santa!

01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:36.291
- Hey.
- I can't believe this, man.

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.208
Oh, wow.

01:20:37.208 --> 01:20:41.208
Oh, what happened here, Santa?
You been tussling with an angry reindeer?

01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:44.541
Whoa!

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:47.250
Ha, ha!

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:49.291
Reindeer 'cause I'm Santa!

01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:52.250
It's not that funny.

01:20:53.583 --> 01:20:55.708
- They're just messing with you.

01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:57.791
It was absolutely not funny.

01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:01.333
<i>♪ Not funny at all ♪</i>

01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:02.916
They do this constantly.

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:05.583
Okay, I get it.

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:06.791
That kiss.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.083
It happened. But Airport James.

01:21:10.708 --> 01:21:13.458
Successful, attractive,

01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:15.000
probably wealthy,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.250
and Teddy is... sweet.

01:21:18.041 --> 01:21:19.750
Teddy is more than just that.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.250
Okay, okay, he can cook.

01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.791
He's kind and considerate and smart.

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:30.541
And his family is hilarious,
and they're just so full of love.

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:33.416
And his mom is adorable.

01:21:33.416 --> 01:21:36.875
Uh, when I left,
she hugged me like I was her own.

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.583
And I guess when Teddy kissed you...

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.750
The world just melted away.

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:49.333
Oh my God.

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:52.333
I am head over heels for Teddy.

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.916
The universe
hasn't been leading me to James.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.208
All the signs are pointing to Teddy.

01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:01.458
Here's the thing.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:04.250
- We know you're not Santa. Reggie's Santa.
- Hi, Reggie!

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.250
What's up, Reggie.
Looking good.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:10.666
Honestly, we needed an excuse
to get you here because we need to know.

01:22:10.666 --> 01:22:12.041
Do you like Layla?

01:22:12.958 --> 01:22:14.791
- Come on.
- Wait. How did y'all--

01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:18.375
Oh, we're in it. We've been following
the whole thing... [chuckles] ...very closely.

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:20.791
Oh yeah, you sounded like 710 DMs.

01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:23.375
We're not just reading the text,
we're reading the subtext.

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:26.416
Yeah, and call us Sherlock Holmes.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.375
And the emojis?
You couldn't have been more obvious.

01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:33.833
So we have to know.
Do you have feelings for this girl?

01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:36.750
Because if you do, she shouldn't be
out there with another guy tonight.

01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.833
- Let's go. Come on.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.958
Roxy, tell me I'm not crazy
going after Teddy.

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:47.291
Oh, girl, you crazy.

01:22:47.291 --> 01:22:49.750
But you're crazy in love.

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:52.833

So you're sure this is
how you want to do this?

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:21.625
Absolutely.

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:24.083
She loves grand gestures,
so I gotta go big.

01:25:24.083 --> 01:25:26.958
Well, Santa's basically a cameo
during "Here Comes Santa Claus."

01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:30.333
You're just gonna slide down the chimney
and throw out a couple "Ho-Ho-Ho's."

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.625
- It's not that complicated.
- Cool.

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:34.625
And Reggie's cool with this?

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:37.583
I'm pretty sure Reggie's been drunk
since three o'clock this afternoon.

01:25:37.583 --> 01:25:38.833
Trust me, he's fine.

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:42.375
Luckily, wardrobe had a backup costume,
because yours was soaked,

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:45.458
and you do not want to wear his.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:47.916
You need a beard.

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:57.583
By the way, um,
I'm also looking for this guy named Teddy.

01:25:57.583 --> 01:26:00.208
Uh, he's supposed to play Santa.
Uh, great smile.

01:26:00.208 --> 01:26:02.666
You don't notice at first,
then you look again, you're like,

01:26:02.666 --> 01:26:04.541
"Wow. You're really hot."

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:07.000
You think I can find him faster backstage?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.458
Sure, if you're...

01:26:08.458 --> 01:26:10.541
- Great, thanks.
- Actually allowed backstage!

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:13.375
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:14.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:15.625
James.

01:26:16.208 --> 01:26:17.541
Wow, okay, you're here.

01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:20.250
Okay, listen, you're not gonna
wanna hear what I have to say,

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:22.541
but I'm just gonna say it, okay?

01:26:22.541 --> 01:26:24.833
I'm sorry. I'm in love. But not with you.

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:27.000
I thought I was with you,
but it's with someone else,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.333
someone who is amazing.

01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:29.958
Not to say that you aren't.

01:26:29.958 --> 01:26:33.083
Believe me, I have spent days
imagining that you are amazing.

01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:35.166
But I know that Teddy is.

01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:37.041
That's the guy, Teddy.

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:40.416
And, um, I need to find him
and tell him how I feel.

01:26:40.416 --> 01:26:44.416

01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:27.208
He's calling me up.

01:33:27.208 --> 01:33:32.208
I'm all about love, but he's not my boss.
Your ticket works, but in the front.

01:33:32.208 --> 01:33:33.791
- I'd run.
I'm not gonna lie.

01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.833
I kind of thought you were crazy
when I heard

01:33:35.833 --> 01:33:40.666
that you were chasing after this guy
after knowing him for two to three hours,

01:33:40.666 --> 01:33:43.000
but I've only known you
for about a day and a half,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.583
and I'd chase you... for a lifetime

01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:50.291
if that meant that I could have you.
If you at all feel...

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.791
like how I feel,
I want to invite you up here with me

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:57.625
and your favorite
musical group of all time.

01:34:01.875 --> 01:34:04.041
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:06.208
- But I have to go in.
- Not until intermission.

01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.625
- Sure.
- Mm-hm.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.750

- I'm sorry!

01:34:14.666 --> 01:34:17.333

01:34:17.333 --> 01:34:18.583
Layla?

01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:21.875

01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:31.833

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:49.916

01:34:49.916 --> 01:34:53.208
the most amazing,
beautiful, considerate person,

01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:55.625
you're making me reconsider everything,

01:34:55.625 --> 01:35:00.208
from opening up my restaurant to...
finally trusting in the universe?

01:35:00.208 --> 01:35:02.250
I'm reconsidering everything too.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.875

01:35:06.791 --> 01:35:08.333

01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:09.375
Wow.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.083
I guess that kiss
really did mean something.

01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:16.333
I guess so.

01:35:17.375 --> 01:35:19.875
Hi, I'm sorry to interject,

01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:21.583
but after all of this,

01:35:21.583 --> 01:35:24.333
I feel like
we need more than "I guess so."

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:27.791
Yeah, I'm thinking you're gonna
have to be, I don't know, certain?

01:35:27.791 --> 01:35:30.791
Yeah, we're way too invested
for any doubt.

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.458
Mm-hm.

01:35:33.125 --> 01:35:35.916
When we had that kiss,

01:35:37.416 --> 01:35:38.875
did the world melt away for you?

01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:40.500
Not the world.

01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:42.333
My whole universe.
