00:44.629 --> 00:46.839
It is the League of Villains!

01:00.311 --> 01:01.604
Damn it!

01:03.231 --> 01:05.524
--That's hard!
--I'm going closer!

01:18.955 --> 01:20.748
Deadbolt!

01:23.292 --> 01:24.627
Sorry!

01:27.672 --> 01:28.923
Dabi!

01:35.721 --> 01:37.807
Whoopsie-daisy.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.559
You're too persistent!

01:46.107 --> 01:48.484
Bastards... What are you up to--

01:48.693 --> 01:50.903
Don't ask pointless questions.

01:52.697 --> 01:54.490
Why are the heroes here?

01:54.699 --> 01:56.617
The information was leaked...

01:56.826 --> 01:58.953
Leaked? From where...?

01:59.161 --> 02:01.205
Who knows...

02:01.747 --> 02:04.208
They got past the pursuit team. Now--

02:04.417 --> 02:06.335
You don't have to spell it out.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.963
Leave it to me.

02:09.170 --> 02:09.964
Endeavor!

02:10.172 --> 02:12.758
The one who's moved up to number one, huh?

02:12.967 --> 02:14.302
It's so late.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.679
You're working hard!

02:16.887 --> 02:18.889
Jetburn!

02:22.977 --> 02:24.353
Hey, hey, hey!

02:24.562 --> 02:28.024
I'll run you over, Endeavor!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.610
Mister, get back.

02:40.286 --> 02:45.166

02:47.626 --> 02:49.795
Damn it, is this it?

02:50.171 --> 02:52.006
Endeavor...

03:10.232 --> 03:11.984
You were here?

03:12.193 --> 03:15.196
Why didn't you give us a hand, Hawks?

03:15.404 --> 03:19.408
I just got here, Endeavor.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.244
What about the League guys?

03:22.453 --> 03:25.289
They were all doubles
made with Twice's Quirk.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.085
What's this?

03:29.293 --> 03:32.046
A life-support system...?

03:32.254 --> 03:35.466
To transport a new type of Nomu or something?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.510
What did you say?!

03:37.718 --> 03:42.598
What in the world are Shigaraki
and the others transporting...?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.568
I was getting tired of waiting, Nine.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.530
It was worth the wait.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.827
The experiment was a success.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.219
The world has become a superhuman society,

04:20.428 --> 04:23.722
and about 80% of the world's population
now has some kind of special trait.

I, Izuku Midoriya, was Quirkless,

04:25.516 --> 04:28.269
I, Izuku Midoriya, was Quirkless,

04:28.477 --> 04:33.274
but then I had a fateful meeting with All Might,

04:33.482 --> 04:36.652
and he transferred the Quirk,
One For All, to me.

And then, I enrolled in the
hero course at U.A. High School,

And then, I enrolled in the
hero course at U.A. High School,

04:42.366 --> 04:46.245
the prestigious school
that has produced many heroes...

04:46.454 --> 04:50.749
I continue to run toward my dream.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.209
That's right,

04:52.418 --> 04:57.840
this is the story of how
I became the greatest hero.

05:12.605 --> 05:15.941
Hey, girls! Come hang out with us!

05:16.150 --> 05:17.443
--Yeah, yeah!
--No, thanks.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.528
Don't say tha--

05:20.821 --> 05:23.199
--What the heck?!
--I-It won't come off!

said his battery's gone bad again.

The villains are gaining power because of that.

Are you saying that in order
to go up against them,

09:07.548 --> 09:10.968
it is imperative that we train
the next generation of heroes?

I'm sure they're probably especially bad,
even for U.A. students.

mean facing huge disasters by yourself

14:46.887 --> 14:50.140
Class Reps, don't you think
we've taken on too many small jobs?

14:50.348 --> 14:53.435
We shouldn't treat small
and large jobs differently.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.689
Even if we're working as heroes,
we're still students.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.735
We must do them faithfully and
earn the trust of the people of the island.

15:01.943 --> 15:07.616
Excuse me! There's someone here who
hasn't done any hero work since we got here.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.410
I've been staying in the office on purpose!

15:10.619 --> 15:15.373
What're you gonna do if a villain
comes out while you jerks are out, huh?!

15:15.582 --> 15:18.418
There aren't any villains on this island.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.588
Excuse us.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.173
Mr. Mayor!

15:23.381 --> 15:27.469
Thanks for carrying Granny
to the hospital earlier.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.471
Thanks for fixing my bike.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.806
And our battery!

15:31.014 --> 15:32.766
And for keeping the beach safe!

15:32.974 --> 15:34.726
Here's some fresh fish!

15:35.852 --> 15:39.272
It's not meant to replace our gratitude,
but please eat it if you'd like.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.025
Let's eat!

15:42.234 --> 15:44.694
You people! Show some restraint!

15:45.946 --> 15:47.823
Thank you for going to all this trouble.

15:48.031 --> 15:52.244
Oh no, it's really been
a big help having you all here.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.704
We're counting on you from now on, too.

15:56.540 --> 16:00.127
--Of course!
--We will do our very best to carry out our duty!

16:01.128 --> 16:03.088
Thanks for the food!

16:04.339 --> 16:06.174
That was delicious!

16:06.383 --> 16:08.510
I can feel the kindness of people in my body.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.097
It's moments like these
that make me glad I became a hero.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.765
Yeah.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.143
Kacchan of the Bakugos!

16:16.351 --> 16:18.019
We're gonna take baths and go to sleep.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.814
So we're counting on you for the night watch!

16:21.022 --> 16:22.065
Why?!

16:22.274 --> 16:25.277
Because you didn't do anything all day.

16:33.034 --> 16:37.539
1,365... 1,366...

16:37.747 --> 16:41.001
--1,367... 1,368...

16:41.001 --> 16:43.211
--I will tell you the truth.
--1,367... 1,368...

16:45.380 --> 16:49.467
My Quirk is the power to transfer power...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.678
One For All!

16:51.887 --> 16:53.597
One person cultivates the power

16:53.805 --> 16:58.476
and passes it on to another person,
who also cultivates it and passes it on.

16:59.394 --> 17:04.232
It is the crystallization of power that spins
together the voices of those who need help

17:04.441 --> 17:06.734
and the hearts of the brave.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.906
And next, it is your turn.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.327
Now that you have inherited One For All,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.246
you may one day have
to fight against this great evil...

17:21.290 --> 17:24.211
Next, it's your turn.

17:30.717 --> 17:36.473
Right now, I can only use
One For All at 20% at the most.

17:37.432 --> 17:43.063
I need to work harder and harder
so I can make this Quirk my own.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.154
Kacchan!

17:51.363 --> 17:52.864
--Oh, thanks for going on patrol.

17:52.864 --> 17:56.952
--Looks like you've grown a bit with your One For All.
--Oh, thanks for going on patrol.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.038
We can't talk about that here...!

18:00.247 --> 18:02.082
I'm impatient.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.960
I-I know that better than anybody.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.587
I've known you since we were kids.

18:08.797 --> 18:12.634
Then hurry up and make your Quirk your own

18:12.842 --> 18:14.928
and fight me!

18:18.056 --> 18:20.225
I'll prove to you

18:20.433 --> 18:23.728
that I'm the one who will become number one.

18:26.273 --> 18:30.944
Yeah, I'll definitely make
my Quirk my own and show you.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.532
In order to become the greatest hero...

18:35.740 --> 18:38.868
And I'll be better than the greatest.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.252
Um...

18:48.086 --> 18:50.422
You're from this afternoon...

18:50.630 --> 18:53.591
A-A villain's...

18:53.800 --> 18:54.843
...come out!

18:55.051 --> 18:56.052
A villain?!

18:56.261 --> 18:58.305
Tell me more!

18:58.471 --> 19:01.474
"Heroes Public Safety Commission"

19:01.975 --> 19:06.688
There have been continuous acts of
violence against heroes since last week.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.982
All the victims were knocked unconscious...

19:09.190 --> 19:12.068
...and they all lost their Quirks.

19:12.277 --> 19:15.530
Shigaraki and his group have acquired
a Quirk-erasing needle manufactured illegally

19:15.739 --> 19:18.450
by a designated villain group.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.412
Do we have reports of them
succeeding in their mass production?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.289
No, we do not.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.874
Then investigate.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.334
Continue your secret inves--

19:27.542 --> 19:31.004
Have you thought about the possibility
that their Quirks were stolen?

19:31.212 --> 19:32.589
What?

19:32.797 --> 19:34.758
The victims were heroes,

19:34.966 --> 19:38.720
so the Quirks that were lost
were naturally all useful ones.

19:38.928 --> 19:46.019
If the suspect has a Quirk
that can steal Quirks like All For One...

19:47.187 --> 19:48.938
That's...

19:49.147 --> 19:52.108
Well, either way, it's related to Shigaraki.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.736
I'll try investigating both possibilities.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.282
So, where'd the cargo end up?

19:59.491 --> 20:02.285
The heroes didn't collect it, right?

20:02.494 --> 20:05.330
Yeah, that's been confirmed.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.501
What was the cargo, anyway?

20:09.709 --> 20:14.506
According to Doctor,
there's no need for us to know.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.924
What the hell?

20:16.132 --> 20:18.551
He just makes us do the transporting,
but he won't tell us anything?

20:18.760 --> 20:21.179
Doesn't it make you even more curious?

20:21.388 --> 20:24.015
Anyway, forget about it. Got it?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.141
Roger!

20:25.350 --> 20:26.935
No way!

20:28.645 --> 20:30.772
Tomura Shigaraki.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.441
Do not touch that.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.027
Forget about it.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.320
Doctor...

20:42.700 --> 20:45.703
"Kyushu Region"

20:48.706 --> 20:51.626
You said the next time you could
come home was in ten days, right?

20:51.835 --> 20:54.254
Daddy, do your best at work.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.965
You don't have to worry about us!

20:57.173 --> 21:00.510
I'll take good care of Katsuma.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.680
Thanks, Mahoro, Katsuma.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.391
I'll bring back as many souvenirs as--

21:16.234 --> 21:18.862
I've finally found it...

21:19.946 --> 21:21.865
F-Found what...?

21:22.824 --> 21:25.660
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.705
But I'll take your Quirk.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.665
We finally got it, huh?

22:12.874 --> 22:16.586
With this, we can make it a reality...

22:16.794 --> 22:19.047
The new world...

22:19.255 --> 22:21.716
...that we desire.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.596
Nine?!

22:28.306 --> 22:30.099
Wh-Why?

22:30.308 --> 22:31.601
Why...?

22:32.894 --> 22:35.897
It doesn't work on type B blood...

22:36.105 --> 22:37.065
What?

22:37.273 --> 22:40.235
After coming this far,
we're back to square one? Damn it!

22:40.443 --> 22:42.779
No, there's still a way.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.533
Daddy, do your best at work.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.535
--You don't have to worry about us!

22:48.535 --> 22:50.161
--I see...
--You don't have to worry about us!

22:50.370 --> 22:52.413
Quirks...

22:52.622 --> 22:54.707
...are hereditary...

22:57.043 --> 22:59.420
Why are you here, too, damn Deku?!

22:59.629 --> 23:01.923
Why? Because if there really is a villain--

23:02.131 --> 23:04.551
I'll be fine by myself!

23:04.759 --> 23:07.053
Hey, where'd you see the villain?!

23:07.262 --> 23:09.430
I-Inside those castle ruins!

23:09.639 --> 23:11.391
Tell me that first!

23:11.599 --> 23:14.686
Mahoro...!

23:18.982 --> 23:20.692
Over there!

23:22.485 --> 23:24.279
Go hide.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.822
Katsuma!

23:27.282 --> 23:30.285
Stun Grenade!

23:34.163 --> 23:35.415
This guy's...

23:37.166 --> 23:38.543
Kacchan!

23:42.130 --> 23:43.965
Huh?

23:51.222 --> 23:52.515
Ouch!

23:53.433 --> 23:54.976
The villain...

23:55.184 --> 23:57.645
Ow, ow... Jeez!

23:57.854 --> 24:00.023
At least get a little scared!

24:00.231 --> 24:02.692
Th-That girl...

24:02.900 --> 24:06.279
You're the one who made that villain illusion?

24:06.279 --> 24:06.404
Gulp
You're the one who made that villain illusion?

24:06.404 --> 24:07.030
"gulp"

24:07.530 --> 24:10.199
Huh? How did you know it was an illusion?

24:10.408 --> 24:11.618
It's obvious!

24:11.826 --> 24:14.078
There's no shadow!

24:14.287 --> 24:15.955
Hey, damn kid,

24:16.164 --> 24:20.126
are you having fun taunting heroes?! Well?!

24:22.754 --> 24:27.425
I'm completely different
from your everyday heroes.

24:27.634 --> 24:32.180
I'm the one who'll be better than
All Might and take the number one spot,

24:32.388 --> 24:34.682
Katsuki Bakugo!

24:34.682 --> 24:34.849
"angry" "angry" "angry"
Katsuki Bakugo!

24:34.849 --> 24:35.058
"angry" "angry" "angry"

24:35.058 --> 24:39.812
"angry" "angry" "angry"
You picked the wrong person to taunt!

24:39.812 --> 24:40.021
"angry" "angry" "angry"

24:40.021 --> 24:42.106
"angry" "angry" "angry"
D-Don't scold my big sister.

24:42.106 --> 24:42.315
"angry" "angry" "angry"

24:42.315 --> 24:43.608
"angry" "angry" "angry"
Huh?!

24:43.608 --> 24:43.858
Huh?!

24:44.067 --> 24:46.486
Are you her accomplice? Then--

24:46.694 --> 24:48.279
You're going overboard, Kacchan!

24:48.488 --> 24:50.698
Let go, damn Deku!

24:50.907 --> 24:52.533
We should just be glad
it was kids playing tricks.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.285
--Katsuma!
--That's the kind of attitude that
makes kids these days act impudent!

24:54.285 --> 24:56.704
--That's the kind of attitude that
makes kids these days act impudent!

24:56.913 --> 24:58.039
--Wait, damn it!

24:58.039 --> 24:59.624
--I told you to stop!
--Wait, damn it!

24:59.624 --> 25:03.878
--I told you to stop!
--Don't give me orders!

25:08.091 --> 25:11.594
Wh-What's up with that Bakugo guy anyway?

25:11.803 --> 25:14.722
Become the number one hero?

25:14.931 --> 25:18.351
Isn't he confusing it with the
ranking of heroes who look like villains?

25:20.019 --> 25:23.398
He... came to save us.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.654
Katsuma, do you want to be a hero that badly?

25:33.116 --> 25:36.327
I'm against it. It's dangerous.

25:36.536 --> 25:40.998
Besides, I know of someone
even cooler than a hero.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.751
Who?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.712
Daddy.

25:46.254 --> 25:51.092
He's always thinking of us and protecting us.

25:52.051 --> 25:56.055
I want you to be as cool as that.

26:02.937 --> 26:06.357
Among the victims, there's
another one who's lost his Quirk.

26:06.566 --> 26:10.361
But this time, he isn't a hero...

26:10.570 --> 26:15.116
On top of that, everything that can be
used to identify him has been stolen.

26:15.324 --> 26:19.912
The suspect doesn't want anyone
to know what Quirk he stole...?

26:20.121 --> 26:22.457
Why does he need to hide it?

26:26.669 --> 26:29.672
Hello, this is the U.A. Hero Agency.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.508
Your travel bag has gone missing?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.761
Okay, we'll send someone right away.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.305
At the shopping arcade,
a tourist said she lost her luggage--

26:37.513 --> 26:39.182
I'll go, I'll go!

26:39.390 --> 26:41.267
Aoyama, come with me!

26:41.476 --> 26:42.435
Oui.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.437
Another lost item?

26:44.645 --> 26:45.521
People should at least try to--

26:45.730 --> 26:49.692
The client sounded really cute on the phone.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.862
I can't leave someone in trouble alone!

26:53.070 --> 26:56.532
Shoji is asking for more support on the beach.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.117
Then, I'll go.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.161
I will go on a regular patrol.

27:00.369 --> 27:04.499
I'll go out, too, to help
with the fields at the Nijimas.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.629
I'm off!

27:13.299 --> 27:15.468
Katsuma...?

27:15.676 --> 27:17.053
Is something the matter?

27:17.261 --> 27:19.222
U-Um...

27:19.430 --> 27:22.433
S-Sorry about yesterday...

27:24.519 --> 27:28.064
You're so well-mannered!
You came to apologize?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.358
It's okay, I'm not mad.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.530
Will you tell the other hero I'm sorry, too?

27:35.738 --> 27:37.949
Sure, I'll tell him.

27:38.157 --> 27:42.870
But Katsuma, why did you do that yesterday?

27:43.079 --> 27:46.541
My big sister hates heroes.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.669
Yesterday, too, she said that
even if I said there were villains,

27:49.877 --> 27:53.631
the heroes would be scared
and wouldn't come save me,

27:53.840 --> 27:56.133
so that's why I...

27:57.051 --> 27:58.511
You believed in us.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.138
Huh?

28:01.347 --> 28:05.142
You believed that we would go save you, right?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.395
That's why you came to get us.

28:09.397 --> 28:12.066
Yeah.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.526
That pin--

28:13.734 --> 28:15.820
It's the Ninja Hero: Edge Shot, right?

28:16.028 --> 28:16.988
Yup!

28:17.196 --> 28:19.824
Do you want to be a hero, too, Katsuma?

28:22.285 --> 28:25.663
My Quirk isn't good for being a hero...

28:25.872 --> 28:29.792
Besides... Mahoro says it's dangerous...

28:30.585 --> 28:34.463
You're part of that famous
U.A.'s hero course, but you're useless.

28:34.672 --> 28:42.054
I see, it's not that Mahoro hates heroes,
it's that she's worried about Katsuma.

28:42.263 --> 28:45.266
Izuku, I can't take this anymore.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.143
You keep getting hurt.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.688
My heart can't take it...

28:55.735 --> 28:57.987
Hey, Katsuma.

28:58.195 --> 29:01.657
What kind of hero do you want to be?

29:03.492 --> 29:07.455
I want to be a strong hero
who can beat up evil villains.

29:07.663 --> 29:14.962
Really? I want to be a hero
who can save people in trouble.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.467
Save people in trouble...?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.135
Yeah.

29:21.344 --> 29:25.264
You want to be a hero who can
defeat the enemy to save people.

29:25.473 --> 29:29.560
I want to defeat the enemy,
so I can save people.

29:29.769 --> 29:33.356
The order is different,
but what we're aiming for is the same--

29:33.564 --> 29:36.484
I think we both want to be the greatest hero.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.071
That's why...

29:40.279 --> 29:42.239
...let's both do our best.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.577
Yeah.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.832
Oh, but we should try not
to worry our families too much.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.501
Yeah!

29:56.712 --> 30:00.132
Little Katsuma really loves heroes, doesn't he?

30:00.341 --> 30:01.300
Here, take this.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.929
Thank you very much, Mrs. Suzumura.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.014
Please be kind to him.

30:08.224 --> 30:12.395
He lost his mother when he was very young.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.773
His father works away from home all year,

30:15.982 --> 30:19.652
so he and his older sister,
Mahoro, live on their own.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.197
Of course, those of us in
the neighborhood look after them.

30:23.406 --> 30:28.744
But it's lonely to not have
parents around at that age.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.084
Mahoro!

30:36.919 --> 30:38.546
Where did you go, Katsuma?

30:38.754 --> 30:40.840
To see Mister Deku.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.051
I went to say sorry for
what happened yesterday.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.095
Why?

30:46.303 --> 30:49.348
I love Daddy.

30:50.349 --> 30:54.228
I want to be someone as cool as Daddy.

30:54.437 --> 30:55.771
But...

30:56.564 --> 30:57.940
But--

30:59.108 --> 31:00.484
Wh-What is it?!

31:03.279 --> 31:04.447
The breakwater...

31:04.655 --> 31:06.073
Why's the ferry coming this way...?

31:06.282 --> 31:08.034
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:13.456 --> 31:15.708
What... What's going on?

31:17.585 --> 31:21.047
Chimera, Mummy,
I don't want to be interrupted.

31:21.255 --> 31:22.590
You two are in charge of diversions.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.050
How should we do it?

31:24.258 --> 31:25.676
However you want.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.053
Roger.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.095
Slice.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.930
I know.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.317
V-Villains...

31:41.525 --> 31:42.735
Those are definitely villains.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.321
Mahoro, tell the heroes!

31:45.529 --> 31:47.031
But they're still students...

31:47.239 --> 31:49.450
Mister Deku would help us!

31:49.658 --> 31:51.410
I'm sure of it!

31:51.869 --> 31:53.954
I finished working the fields.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.498
Welcome back, Midoriya.

31:55.706 --> 31:57.333
Good work!

32:00.669 --> 32:02.797
What? If it's a lame job--

32:03.005 --> 32:04.799
Villains appeared at the fishing harbor!

32:05.007 --> 32:06.008
That voice...

32:06.217 --> 32:08.094
You're that damn kid
from yesterday, aren't you?

32:08.302 --> 32:10.221
--Don't think you can keep tricking us--

32:10.221 --> 32:11.388
--I'm not lying!
--Don't think you can keep tricking us--

32:11.597 --> 32:12.598
--I'm telling the truth, Bakugo!

32:12.598 --> 32:13.766
--Hello? It's Deku!
--I'm telling the truth, Bakugo!

32:13.974 --> 32:15.810
--Bastard.
--At the fishing harbor, vi--

32:18.687 --> 32:20.356
What did Mahoro say?

32:20.898 --> 32:23.526
"Nabu island"
"Base Transceiver Station"

32:23.734 --> 32:26.904
Communications have been cut off.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.531
Next...

32:29.573 --> 32:31.659
I hope she was worried over nothing...

32:31.867 --> 32:33.994
Anyway, I'll go to the fishing harbor.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.793
Thank you so, so much!

32:41.001 --> 32:42.586
Isn't it great, Maakun?

32:42.795 --> 32:44.505
Yeah, Miitan.

32:44.713 --> 32:49.552
What the heck? She had a boyfriend!
Damn that Ashido...

32:51.345 --> 32:52.513
What was that?!

32:55.432 --> 32:57.726
Heroes, it's a v-villain!

33:01.105 --> 33:02.606
It's seriously a villain!

33:02.815 --> 33:04.066
That's too sudden!

33:04.275 --> 33:05.901
W-We need to do something!

33:06.110 --> 33:08.362
Aoyama, use your bellybutton beam!

33:08.571 --> 33:10.406
It's called "Navel Laser"!

33:14.910 --> 33:19.623
Oh? Three heroes in the middle of nowhere?

33:29.049 --> 33:31.010
He just made more...!

33:34.221 --> 33:37.057
Hagakure, did you contact the office?

33:37.266 --> 33:38.976
I can't reach them!

33:39.185 --> 33:39.226
I don't have any signal!

33:39.226 --> 33:40.394
"No Service"
I don't have any signal!

33:40.394 --> 33:40.436
"No Service"

33:40.603 --> 33:41.520
No way!

33:41.729 --> 33:45.357
If I keep shooting, my stomach will...

33:45.566 --> 33:46.567
Damn it!

33:46.775 --> 33:48.694
What should we do?!

33:50.779 --> 33:52.489
Froppy, Tentacole!

33:52.698 --> 33:54.283
Evacuating everyone is our first priority!

33:54.491 --> 33:55.659
Got it!

33:56.785 --> 33:58.913
Get away from here, quickly.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.998
Twirling Tail Dance!

34:03.667 --> 34:04.793
What are you after?

34:05.002 --> 34:06.462
Why are you doing this?!

34:06.670 --> 34:09.172
You're young for a hero.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.512
--Tokoyami!
--Sorry I'm late!

34:15.721 --> 34:16.722
Dark Shadow!

34:16.931 --> 34:18.306
Got it!

34:23.938 --> 34:25.563
We can't use our smartphones.

34:25.773 --> 34:27.190
Go back to the office and get help!

34:27.399 --> 34:28.275
But--

34:28.484 --> 34:30.735
I'll hold things here!

34:33.572 --> 34:35.991
Huh? My phone has no signal!

34:36.199 --> 34:36.992
You're right.

34:37.201 --> 34:38.869
--Mine, too.
--And mine.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.329
What's going on?

34:40.536 --> 34:42.081
Don't tell me...

34:42.289 --> 34:44.750
This is bad! Th-There's a villain!

34:44.958 --> 34:46.001
A villain?!

34:46.210 --> 34:48.003
He's going wild at the shopping arcade!

34:48.212 --> 34:50.255
There are heroes fighting him, but--

34:50.464 --> 34:51.297
Reporting in!

34:51.507 --> 34:53.007
A villain has appeared at the beach!

34:53.217 --> 34:55.552
--What?!
--Ojiro and the others are fighting a defensive battle.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.719
They're asking for help!

34:56.929 --> 34:59.682
--Iida!
--There's no time to hesitate.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.684
Everyone here, split up into two groups

35:01.892 --> 35:03.519
and deal with the villains!

35:03.727 --> 35:06.063
Bakugo, Kirishima, and Kaminari,

35:06.272 --> 35:08.649
intercept the villain at the shopping arcade!

35:08.857 --> 35:11.068
Yaoyorozu, Jiro, and Ashido,

35:11.277 --> 35:14.029
work on relief and evacuation of
the islanders in the shopping arcade!

35:14.238 --> 35:17.283
Todoroki, Sato, Sero, and Tokoyami,

35:17.491 --> 35:19.243
come with me to the beach!

35:19.451 --> 35:20.703
Uraraka and Koda,

35:20.911 --> 35:23.580
you're on relief and evacuation
of the people at the beach!

35:23.789 --> 35:25.624
We're in a race against time.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.460
We're the only heroes on this island.

35:28.669 --> 35:31.964
And we're the only ones who
can save the people on this island!

35:32.172 --> 35:36.468
U.A. High School hero course
Class 1-A, heading out!

35:37.594 --> 35:39.305
The fishing harbor!

35:39.513 --> 35:41.724
I need to tell everyone...

35:41.932 --> 35:43.475
No signal...?

35:45.769 --> 35:47.604
Villains have come to this island.

35:47.813 --> 35:51.942
The others are probably also aware of
the situation and are dealing with them.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.446
Then right now,
I should confirm Mahoro's safety.

35:55.946 --> 35:58.073
Mahoro lives...

35:58.282 --> 36:01.618
...those of us in the
neighborhood look after them.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.038
...near Mrs. Suzumura!

36:13.839 --> 36:17.176
M-My stomach is at its limit...

36:17.384 --> 36:20.554
My scalp is at its limit, too...

36:21.430 --> 36:23.640
Mineta! Aoyama!

36:27.061 --> 36:30.022
You're struggling too much against small fry,

36:30.230 --> 36:31.482
you extras!

36:31.690 --> 36:33.859
Bakugo!

36:34.068 --> 36:35.486
Hey!

36:35.694 --> 36:38.447
Red Riot is on the scene!

36:40.366 --> 36:42.576
Chargebolt is also on the scene!

36:42.785 --> 36:44.036
You two!

36:44.244 --> 36:45.746
Friends, huh?

36:46.330 --> 36:47.164
Everyone!

36:47.373 --> 36:48.957
Yao-momo, everyone!

36:49.166 --> 36:52.002
We'll evacuate the people of
the island and provide first-aid relief.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.045
Right!

36:53.253 --> 36:55.714
Armor-Piercing Shot: Auto-Cannon!

37:00.803 --> 37:02.429
Oh, no!

37:02.638 --> 37:03.806
Sorry!

37:04.014 --> 37:05.391
Bakugo!

37:05.599 --> 37:06.725
Damn it!

37:08.435 --> 37:10.270
What the hell?!

37:10.479 --> 37:14.608
Objects wrapped in my bandages
will move according to my will.

37:14.817 --> 37:19.196
It does not work on living things,
but the materials you have on your body...

37:19.405 --> 37:23.450
Your armor and clothes are all mine to control.

37:26.203 --> 37:27.329
Bakugo!

37:31.458 --> 37:34.378
Fight amongst yourselves!

37:41.009 --> 37:41.927
Ojiro!

37:42.136 --> 37:43.679
Octoblow!

37:45.722 --> 37:50.352
With that appearance,
you must've been bullied a lot.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.188
Did you ever resent your parents for it?!

37:53.397 --> 37:54.815
Huh?

37:59.695 --> 38:02.489
--Shoji!
--Leave this place to us!

38:02.698 --> 38:04.575
Take care of Ojiro!

38:05.951 --> 38:09.121
--Now!
--Tokoyami, Sato!

38:09.329 --> 38:11.540
Sugar Rush!

38:11.748 --> 38:13.750
Don't push your luck!

38:20.174 --> 38:21.675
Sato!

38:22.176 --> 38:23.469
Hey, hey,

38:23.677 --> 38:27.806
even if you're all kids,
there are too many heroes here.

38:29.516 --> 38:32.436
Mahoro, we need to tell
the heroes about the villains!

38:32.644 --> 38:34.980
My cell phone doesn't work,
so I can't do anything about that.

38:35.189 --> 38:38.442
Let's go home first and
let the people in the village--

38:46.492 --> 38:47.951
Our house...

38:50.204 --> 38:52.456
Found you.

38:52.664 --> 38:56.543
Cell activation of type B blood...

38:56.752 --> 39:00.339
Boy, I'm going to steal your Quirk.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.092
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

39:04.301 --> 39:06.553
D-Don't come any closer!

39:08.931 --> 39:12.768
I... I-I said don't come closer!

39:13.810 --> 39:16.438
I know it's just an illusion.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.734
Mahoro...

39:25.906 --> 39:27.491
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

39:29.785 --> 39:32.037
A super power Quirk...

39:33.038 --> 39:36.041
--Are you okay? Can you run?
--Yeah.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.626
Hurry up and get away from here.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.211
Okay!

39:44.132 --> 39:45.717
Stop!

39:46.635 --> 39:49.513
Why are you targeting those kids?!

39:49.721 --> 39:50.597
Move.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.724
No way I'm moving.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.811
If you're going to get
in the way, then I'll kill you.

39:58.689 --> 39:59.773
An invisible wall?!

39:59.982 --> 40:01.358
A wall made of air?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.282
He fired from his nails?

40:08.490 --> 40:11.868
Two Quirks that aren't related at all...

40:12.077 --> 40:13.954
That's almost exactly like...

40:15.956 --> 40:17.791
...All For One...

40:20.544 --> 40:21.962
Stop, Bakugo!

40:24.214 --> 40:26.216
He's being completely controlled...

40:26.425 --> 40:28.176
What should we do, Kirishima?

40:28.385 --> 40:29.720
You're asking me?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.638
Shoot!

40:31.847 --> 40:33.348
Damn it...

40:33.557 --> 40:34.808
Choose.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.936
Become my puppets...

40:38.145 --> 40:40.772
...or be defeated by your friend...

40:42.065 --> 40:45.611
Stop screwing around!

40:47.654 --> 40:48.947
What?!

40:51.283 --> 40:55.120
Don't underestimate me, mummy bastard!

40:56.121 --> 40:58.915
He sacrificed it on his own...

41:13.764 --> 41:16.058
I stocked up a lot, you know.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.895
Maximum blast...

41:20.103 --> 41:22.814
Die...!

41:30.989 --> 41:32.574
Yeah, good job, Bakugo!

41:32.783 --> 41:35.952
He kept the damage to
the buildings to a minimum, too.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.996
--Everyone!
--Where's the villain?

41:38.205 --> 41:40.666
What? I beat him easily.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.292
What about the islanders?

41:42.501 --> 41:44.920
We've evacuated them all
to the west district.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.547
Where are you going, Bakugo?!

41:47.756 --> 41:50.258
I'll leave the rescuing to you guys!

41:50.467 --> 41:52.844
I'm gonna go crush the other villains!

42:01.228 --> 42:03.772
Damn it, he's holding us down with power.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.857
Iida, what can we do?

42:06.066 --> 42:09.319
Right now, we should only think
about how we can hold this guy here

42:09.528 --> 42:11.446
until the islanders finish evacuating.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.117
Black Abyss!

42:16.159 --> 42:18.620
Reciproburst!

42:24.251 --> 42:26.962
Not putting up much of a fight, heroes!

42:30.340 --> 42:31.550
Wh--?!

42:38.223 --> 42:40.308
At this rate...

42:40.517 --> 42:42.310
Delaware Smash...

42:42.519 --> 42:44.563
...Air Force!

42:48.233 --> 42:50.277
Stone-like blasts of air...

42:50.485 --> 42:52.946
That's an interesting way of using it.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.741
I can't let that guy get close
to Katsuma and Mahoro.

42:55.949 --> 42:58.201
I'll continue to keep him in check like this...

43:03.665 --> 43:05.542
This time it was a gust of wind!

43:05.751 --> 43:07.878
Just how many Quirks does he have?

43:08.962 --> 43:11.298
If the opponent is an unknown, then rather
than take the wait-and-see approach,

43:11.506 --> 43:13.091
I should attack first.

43:15.010 --> 43:19.973
One For All: Full Cowling... 20%!

43:22.225 --> 43:24.936
His power increased...!

43:26.146 --> 43:28.982
With the most power I can use right now...

43:29.191 --> 43:33.403
St. Louis Smash!

43:38.784 --> 43:41.912
Twenty percent... isn't enough?!

43:42.120 --> 43:45.791
This power... this Quirk...

43:45.999 --> 43:49.336
...is worth stealing...

43:49.544 --> 43:53.590
S-Steal? He said "steal"...

43:53.799 --> 43:57.427
He has the same
Quirk as All For One after all...

43:57.636 --> 44:00.722
One For All will be stolen...!

44:07.854 --> 44:09.105
I can't steal it.

44:09.314 --> 44:13.652
No, I don't have enough
free spaces to steal them all...

44:13.860 --> 44:19.783
This kid has the potential
to have more than one Quirk...

44:19.991 --> 44:24.079
Move, body! Move, move!

44:24.287 --> 44:26.790
His very existence is a threat.

44:26.998 --> 44:30.544
Then, I will simply eliminate him...

44:32.921 --> 44:35.757
I was pushed back by a wall of air?

44:35.966 --> 44:37.551
Mister Deku...?

44:39.135 --> 44:40.929
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

44:41.137 --> 44:42.806
R-Run away...

44:43.014 --> 44:43.807
But...

44:44.015 --> 44:45.809
It's fine, just hurry!

44:46.017 --> 44:50.188
He's after... you tw--

44:53.149 --> 44:54.818
Mister Deku!

45:00.198 --> 45:01.366
Hurry...

45:01.575 --> 45:03.201
Go...!

45:07.122 --> 45:10.625
No... No...

45:10.834 --> 45:13.628
No...!

45:16.715 --> 45:18.675
What is that?

45:18.884 --> 45:21.344
Deku...?

45:21.553 --> 45:23.513
Someone, please...

45:23.722 --> 45:27.517
Protect Deku...!

45:31.980 --> 45:33.857
An exploding Quirk...

45:34.065 --> 45:36.526
Found you, damn villain!

45:36.735 --> 45:38.695
Kacchan!

45:38.904 --> 45:39.905
That's...

45:40.113 --> 45:41.114
Bakugo?!

45:41.323 --> 45:43.658
Kids, look closely!

45:43.867 --> 45:47.078
At the strength of the man who'll become...

45:47.287 --> 45:49.289
...the number one hero!

45:50.457 --> 45:51.917
Got you!

45:59.507 --> 46:01.426
Kacchan!

46:02.552 --> 46:05.722
D-Damn it...

46:05.931 --> 46:09.309
Kacchan, the villain has multiple Quirks.

46:09.517 --> 46:11.269
He steals them!

46:11.478 --> 46:14.731
Damn, like All For One, huh?

46:14.940 --> 46:19.027
Then I've got even more reason to crush him!

46:19.736 --> 46:21.863
If I've seen it once...

46:27.118 --> 46:30.413
...it's not gonna work on me again!

46:39.172 --> 46:42.801
It's got my ribs...!

46:46.054 --> 46:47.347
Move...

46:47.555 --> 46:49.057
Move...!

46:49.265 --> 46:51.643
You just won't stop barking.

46:51.851 --> 46:54.521
The same goes for you!

46:57.649 --> 46:58.817
Damn Deku!

47:04.155 --> 47:06.032
Detroit...

47:06.241 --> 47:07.742
...Sma--

47:15.542 --> 47:18.128
Wh-What's happening...?!

47:18.878 --> 47:20.463
What is that?

47:20.672 --> 47:22.757
The electricity...

47:28.346 --> 47:30.015
Now...

47:34.686 --> 47:38.356
I won't... let you go...

47:38.565 --> 47:42.902
Th-The fight... isn't over yet...

47:43.111 --> 47:44.654
Mister Deku...!

47:44.863 --> 47:46.406
Bakugo!

47:48.742 --> 47:51.995
Heroes really are...

47:59.627 --> 48:02.255
I-Is he in pain?

48:02.464 --> 48:04.090
Why?

48:04.299 --> 48:05.967
Nine!

48:06.176 --> 48:07.761
Get a hold of yourself, Nine.

48:07.969 --> 48:10.221
Th-The boy...

48:10.430 --> 48:12.098
I understand.

48:13.558 --> 48:15.560
Don't struggle.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.690
Don't worry, we're friends.

48:20.899 --> 48:23.568
Now, while they're distracted!

48:23.777 --> 48:25.737
--Tsu!
--Ribbit!

48:32.035 --> 48:33.119
Follow them!

48:33.328 --> 48:37.165
Get that boy no matter what it takes!

48:37.373 --> 48:38.416
Nine,

48:38.625 --> 48:40.794
they can't leave this island.

48:41.002 --> 48:43.630
You should let your body heal right now.

48:46.716 --> 48:49.052
That's it?

48:49.260 --> 48:52.263
You barely escaped with your lives, huh, kids?

48:54.224 --> 48:55.809
He's running away?

48:56.017 --> 48:58.645
It's probably more accurate
to say he's letting us go.

48:58.853 --> 49:00.396
--Damn it.
--Don't go!

49:00.605 --> 49:02.273
It might be a trap.

49:02.482 --> 49:05.485
He's someone we couldn't bring
down even with this many people.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.237
It's dangerous to go after him alone.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.238
But--

49:08.446 --> 49:11.116
We need to check to make sure
the islanders are safe right now.

49:11.324 --> 49:13.451
That's a hero's job, too.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.682
You two are using too much of your Quirks...

49:35.890 --> 49:38.268
We don't know when the villains will be back.

49:38.476 --> 49:41.771
If I don't work too hard here,
then when will I--yay!

49:41.980 --> 49:44.232
You're already in your "yay" mode.

49:46.943 --> 49:48.903
--Here you go.
--Thanks.

49:49.112 --> 49:50.613
It's hot, so be careful.

49:50.822 --> 49:52.448
Please take only one per person!

49:52.657 --> 49:54.784
There's enough for everyone.

49:58.621 --> 50:00.582
What happened to the villains?

50:00.790 --> 50:02.208
Please do not worry.

50:02.417 --> 50:05.128
We will definitely protect you all.

50:07.714 --> 50:10.341
It's a good thing this island
has a lot of ingredients.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.427
What happened to the villain we caught?

50:12.635 --> 50:16.514
Oh, he's been locked up in
the boiler room in the basement.

50:16.723 --> 50:20.518
Apparently, he's not saying anything
no matter how much he's interrogated.

50:23.188 --> 50:26.232
Todoroki, how are Deku and Bakugo?

50:26.441 --> 50:28.401
They haven't regained consciousness yet.

50:28.610 --> 50:32.405
The doctor from the clinic
is treating them, but...

50:36.451 --> 50:37.702
Thank you for your hard work.

50:37.911 --> 50:43.708
Sorry, all our Quirks can do
is to close up their wounds.

50:43.917 --> 50:46.044
We can't do anything about their broken bones.

50:46.252 --> 50:49.005
They'd have to be taken to a hospital
on the main island for more than this.

50:51.633 --> 50:53.843
Let me help.

50:54.052 --> 50:55.386
Katsuma?

50:55.595 --> 50:59.098
Katsuma's Quirk looks like
it's the activation of cells.

50:59.307 --> 51:01.893
We don't know if he can heal
their injuries or not, though...

51:02.101 --> 51:05.563
They got hurt protecting us.

51:05.772 --> 51:07.357
That's why...

51:08.149 --> 51:10.401
I'd like to ask for
your help, too, Little Katsu.

51:10.610 --> 51:12.195
Okay!

51:13.863 --> 51:15.323
I need to save them!

51:16.491 --> 51:20.328
No, I will save them!

51:26.584 --> 51:28.044
How's Nine doing?

51:28.253 --> 51:29.212
He's fine.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.465
He should wake up in a few hours.

51:32.966 --> 51:33.841
Where's Mummy?

51:34.050 --> 51:35.635
He's not here?

51:36.344 --> 51:38.137
Don't tell me the heroes got him?!

51:38.346 --> 51:40.431
Of course not.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.018
Even if that was the case,
our plan will still continue.

51:44.227 --> 51:47.188
It definitely... definitely will.

51:58.950 --> 52:02.704
Why are you saving me?

52:02.912 --> 52:05.164
Come with me.

52:06.499 --> 52:12.880
We will destroy the society where
you were called a monster and a villain.

52:14.299 --> 52:17.552
A world where only the powerful rule...

52:17.760 --> 52:19.679
That's what we'll make.

52:30.106 --> 52:32.483
Join the League of Villains?

52:32.692 --> 52:33.818
Strictly speaking,

52:34.027 --> 52:37.447
I will donate my body to the
League's Quirk-enhancing experiment.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.490
Are you planning on using them?

52:39.699 --> 52:41.743
It's too dangerous.

52:45.621 --> 52:50.626
We need an even greater power.

52:52.712 --> 52:55.590
We bet everything on you.

52:55.798 --> 52:57.800
Don't die on us...

53:04.474 --> 53:08.603
You're compatible with
All For One's Quirk factor.

53:08.811 --> 53:15.818
You've become a being who can
steal eight Quirks and use nine.

53:18.154 --> 53:20.323
The experiment was a success.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.742
With this, our plan is--

53:22.950 --> 53:26.245
But the side effects have also gotten worse.

53:26.454 --> 53:28.081
If I use the Quirks too much,

53:28.289 --> 53:30.958
my body's cellular tissues get destroyed.

53:31.167 --> 53:31.959
That's...

53:32.168 --> 53:35.296
Then there was no point in getting the surgery!

53:35.505 --> 53:39.175
I'll steal a cell activation Quirk.

53:40.009 --> 53:42.637
And then...

53:42.845 --> 53:46.015
...the world we desire...

53:55.233 --> 53:57.443
Katsuma, you should sleep a little...

53:57.652 --> 53:59.445
No, I can keep going.

53:59.654 --> 54:02.031
--But...
--I can do it.

54:02.865 --> 54:04.826
I'm not gonna give up.

54:07.245 --> 54:09.539
A hero doesn't give up...!

54:16.712 --> 54:18.089
Mister Deku!

54:18.756 --> 54:20.174
Bakugo!

54:21.426 --> 54:23.428
First, here's a report on the current situation.

54:23.636 --> 54:25.721
The communications and
electricity grids have been destroyed

54:25.930 --> 54:27.849
and we cannot call for help...

54:28.057 --> 54:32.979
Earlier, I created a drone that
could transmit an S.0.S. message

54:33.187 --> 54:35.857
and sent it toward the main island.

54:36.065 --> 54:38.151
It will take at least six hours to land there.

54:38.359 --> 54:41.571
And then it will take even
more time for help to arrive.

54:41.779 --> 54:45.116
I don't think the villains
will wait that long...

54:45.324 --> 54:50.496
Right now, our highest priority must be
to protect the people of the island...

54:50.705 --> 54:55.334
--How?
--The villain was able to beat up Midoriya and Bakugo so much that they passed out!

54:55.543 --> 54:58.629
The one we fought was also extremely skilled.

54:58.838 --> 55:00.173
Even if we're going to fight,

55:00.381 --> 55:03.384
Yao-momo and Kaminari have both
used up a lot of their Quirks already...

55:03.593 --> 55:04.760
Yay.

55:04.969 --> 55:08.306
Of just the ones we know of,
there are still three villains left.

55:08.514 --> 55:11.184
If they all attack at once,
we won't stand a chance.

55:11.392 --> 55:14.145
At least, if we knew
what the villains were after...

55:14.353 --> 55:18.024
Yeah, then we could come up with a plan.

55:19.150 --> 55:21.235
I'm going to steal your Quirk.

55:27.366 --> 55:28.451
Katsuma--

55:28.659 --> 55:31.954
The villains are after me.

55:32.163 --> 55:33.164
What did you say?

55:33.372 --> 55:36.042
He said that he would steal my Quirk.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.835
Quirk hijacking?

55:38.044 --> 55:40.338
It's just like All For One, huh?

55:40.546 --> 55:42.632
But we know what the villains are after.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.425
We can just take this boy and run away--

55:44.634 --> 55:46.552
It's not going to be that easy.

55:46.761 --> 55:48.012
We're up against villains here.

55:48.221 --> 55:52.517
They could threaten to kill the islanders
if we don't give them the boy.

55:52.725 --> 55:55.102
Then what should we do...?

55:58.731 --> 56:01.526
Give me to the villains!

56:01.734 --> 56:04.695
--What?
--He said he wouldn't kill me.

56:04.904 --> 56:07.365
It's fine if I lose my Quirk.

56:07.573 --> 56:10.034
If that will save everyone on the island...

56:10.243 --> 56:12.119
We can't do that!

56:13.996 --> 56:14.872
Deku?

56:15.081 --> 56:17.625
Midoriya, are you okay now?

56:18.834 --> 56:21.629
Thanks to Katsuma's Quirk.

56:21.837 --> 56:25.007
My Quirk isn't good for being a hero...

56:26.467 --> 56:28.261
Cell activation...

56:28.469 --> 56:30.513
Accelerated cell regeneration...

56:30.721 --> 56:32.974
And even enhanced performance...

56:33.182 --> 56:35.643
Thanks to that,
I've already recovered this much!

56:35.851 --> 56:38.646
It's an amazing Quirk, Katsuma.

56:38.854 --> 56:40.565
Thanks.

56:41.190 --> 56:43.526
Mister Deku...

56:43.734 --> 56:46.779
We won't let anything scary happen to you.

56:46.988 --> 56:49.824
That's what we're here for!

56:51.617 --> 56:56.205
So, we just have to kill
those damn villains, right?

56:56.414 --> 56:58.040
Bakugo!

57:01.168 --> 57:04.755
Save people to win and win to save people.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.342
If you both recognize each other

57:08.551 --> 57:11.137
and can focus on making each other stronger...

57:12.471 --> 57:15.474
...then you can become the greatest heroes.

57:20.229 --> 57:23.608
We will definitely protect you two.

57:23.816 --> 57:25.901
We'll crush those villains.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.154
We'll also definitely
save the people of the island!

57:28.362 --> 57:30.573
We'll definitely win!

57:30.781 --> 57:33.659
Bakugo, Midoriya, I'm on board, too.

57:33.868 --> 57:37.705
I want to protect the people of the island, too.

57:37.913 --> 57:38.706
Let's fight!

57:38.914 --> 57:40.708
If you insist.

57:40.916 --> 57:44.211
If I don't fix the tractor at
Mr. Matsuda's, I'll be stuck at yay.

57:44.420 --> 57:49.050
Me, too. I want Granny Sato to live a long life.

57:49.258 --> 57:50.343
Count me in, too!

57:50.551 --> 57:51.344
And me.

57:51.552 --> 57:53.137
--Me, too.
--Of course!

57:53.346 --> 57:54.889
--Me, too!
--Yeah.

57:55.097 --> 57:56.849
--Me, too!
--Ribbit!

57:57.058 --> 57:58.809
All right, let's do this!

57:59.018 --> 58:00.394
Yeah, let's do it.

58:00.603 --> 58:01.896
That's all we can do.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.981
Because we're heroes!

58:04.190 --> 58:06.567
We'll overcome the impossible.

58:06.776 --> 58:08.861
It's something we always say, right?

58:09.070 --> 58:10.738
Go beyond!

58:10.946 --> 58:13.491
Plus Ultra!

58:16.827 --> 58:18.704
Midoriya, what's the plan?

58:18.913 --> 58:21.165
We know there are at least
three villains still out there.

58:21.374 --> 58:24.126
We'll use the castle ruins with
a sheer cliff behind us as our base

58:24.335 --> 58:27.296
and leave the enemy only
a single route to reach us.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.174
Then, split up the villains
with a preemptive strike.

58:30.383 --> 58:32.176
Using the terrain in each area...

58:32.385 --> 58:34.261
...we'll beat them into the ground!

58:34.470 --> 58:38.057
We'll have the people of the island
evacuate into a cave in the cliff.

58:38.265 --> 58:41.185
Katsuma and Mahoro will be guarded by us.

58:41.394 --> 58:44.105
We also should secure an escape route
to use if it comes down to it.

58:44.313 --> 58:46.899
How will we deal with
the one with multiple Quirks?

58:47.108 --> 58:49.026
When Kacchan and I fought him,

58:49.235 --> 58:51.654
he suddenly looked like he was in pain.

58:51.862 --> 58:55.866
It's probably too hard on his body
for him to use the Quirks a lot.

58:56.075 --> 58:59.912
That's why he's trying to steal
Katsuma's cell activation Quirk.

59:00.121 --> 59:02.915
I see, so we'll exhaust him.

59:03.124 --> 59:07.169
We'll attack the villain in waves
and make him use his Quirks.

59:07.378 --> 59:08.629
Since he can steal Quirks,

59:08.838 --> 59:11.549
we'll do this in a way
that avoids close combat if possible.

59:11.757 --> 59:15.594
If that lets us defeat
the villain, that's great.

59:15.803 --> 59:18.055
But even if we can't,
if we can just last until help comes...

59:18.264 --> 59:20.015
...then we can protect everyone.

59:20.224 --> 59:21.559
No.

59:21.767 --> 59:24.270
We'll definitely win.

59:28.399 --> 59:29.400
Nine.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.736
The target is at the top of the castle mountain.

59:31.944 --> 59:32.820
The heroes are, too.

59:33.028 --> 59:35.322
What, a siege?

59:37.575 --> 59:39.660
Let's head toward our goal.

59:39.869 --> 59:41.537
One who will become king

59:41.746 --> 59:43.789
doesn't need to rely on cheap tricks.

59:53.966 --> 59:55.885
They're here. Three of them.

59:56.635 --> 59:58.471
They're walking together
on the route we predicted.

59:59.305 --> 01:00:02.683
We're counting on you, Yaoyorozu, Aoyama.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:06.187
Twenty seconds until
the villains reach the spot...

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:09.648
Aoyama, Navel Laser at max output!

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:12.485
Energy charge...!

01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:17.740
Five, four, three, two, one!

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:20.618
Can't Stop Twinkling...

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.704
...Supernova!

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.878
Plus Ultra!

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.301
They've split up!

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:43.432
Using the last of my lipids, I made these!

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:46.352
My final attack!

01:00:49.772 --> 01:00:51.315
Where are they aimin--

01:00:51.524 --> 01:00:53.067
What?!

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.367
Phase one, finished...

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.869
S-Some leaked out...

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.247
We've succeeded in splitting them up!

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:07.289
All right!

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.667
The villains are being
lured to the arranged spots!

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.254
So far, everything's going according to plan.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.506
We will definitely protect everyone!

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.388
Tape Shot...

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.348
...Trident!

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.642
Release!

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.148
Uraraka!

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:36.485
That was close!

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.154
Sero!

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.580
Make the villain...

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.665
...use his Quirks!

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:52.835
Shoot away!

01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:02.177
They split us up, huh?

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:09.018
I messed up!

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.187
That was close!

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:18.193
Ashido, leave the rest to me.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.487
This is my world.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.532
Cheeky boy.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:32.666
Damn... They split us up discreetly, huh?

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.680
--All right!
--All according to plan.

01:02:46.889 --> 01:02:48.098
No.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.857
Hey, that was cold.

01:02:57.066 --> 01:02:58.776
We meet again.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.569
Stop that.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.655
Today...

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.492
...I'm serious.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.160
We're different today, too!

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:11.330
Now that all the islanders
are evacuated, we can go all out...

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.290
...to stop you.

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:16.126
Recipro Turbo!

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:18.879
Let's end this in ten minutes!

01:03:19.088 --> 01:03:20.839
--Yeah! --Right!
--Ribbit!

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.136
Just what I wanted.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:31.392
Damn it, we couldn't even slow him down!

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.436
What about this?

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:01.088
It's almost time for our real attack!

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.465
--Y-Yeah!
--Sero! Uraraka!

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:04.550
Mineta!

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.802
I'm ready!

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:09.763
We're counting on you, Uraraka!

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:19.732
Plus...

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:23.277
...Ultra!

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:38.000
Go, Mineta!

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:42.504
Super Grape Rush!

01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:45.966
Take that, and that,
and that, and that, and that!

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:50.054
And that, and that,
and that, and that, and that!

01:04:52.014 --> 01:04:54.141
This was our real attack!

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:57.478
--All right!
--W-We did it...

01:04:58.771 --> 01:04:59.938
Are you all right?!

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.648
Serves you right...

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.817
We've sealed you away...

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:14.244
He defended against the real attack!

01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:16.914
The villain's approaching
Uraraka and the others!

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.343
In that case...

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:33.639
Aoyama!

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.849
Yao-momo!

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:37.476
While you have the chance...

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.228
Prepare yourselves--

01:05:40.771 --> 01:05:42.314
It's no use.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.319
Playtime's over.

01:05:58.372 --> 01:06:00.457
You were still alive?

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:05.254
If you're gonna sleep-talk, then sleep and die!

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.132
Bakugo's joined the battle!

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:11.343
--Midoriya?
--Take care of Katsuma and Mahoro!

01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:13.762
--Mister Deku!
--Deku!

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.099
We'll defend this place till the end!

01:06:17.558 --> 01:06:19.601
Take this!

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.689
If I can't protect them here,

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.525
then there's no point in trying to be a hero!

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:31.613
St. Louis Smash!

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:36.160
It doesn't have to be at full power.

01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:39.288
Just think about how
to make him use his Quirks!

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.922
X-Catapult!

01:06:58.182 --> 01:07:00.309
Not bad...

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.352
After this...

01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.646
...we'll kill you!

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:13.155
What do you mean, "This is my world"?

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.365
Say something more energetic!

01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:18.118
Is that all you've got?

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.206
She's made more moves.

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:26.084
I just need an opening for an instant!

01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:28.003
How pathetic.

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.343
Black Abyss: Sabbath!

01:07:36.345 --> 01:07:39.139
--Now!
--Acid Shot!

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.559
We'll decide this all at once!

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.271
How dare you...

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:56.698
Ashido!

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:05.123
You little...!

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.670
Th... This is...

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.926
I won't let you get in Nine's way!

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.455
Tokoyami?

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:47.249
Dark Shadow...

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.044
Pay attention to what's in front of you!

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.671
I know!

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.051
It's no use!

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:01.095
Red Gauntlet!

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:02.723
That itches.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:23.702
I told you brats that it was no use!

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.372
M-My body's...?!

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:30.792
There was a reason why we
repeated the same boring moves.

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:34.462
On my legs and Kirishima's hands,

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:38.216
we smeared a toxic mucus made by Asui.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.218
You mean, "Tsu."

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:43.305
Resign yourself, old man!

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:46.099
Acting so insolent...

01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:50.437
I'll show you...

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:54.274
...why I'm called a monster!

01:09:58.653 --> 01:10:00.280
He's gotten bigger?!

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:03.075
That form makes him look like Amajiki!

01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:14.169
--Damn!
--Asui!

01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:15.504
Ribbit!

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.105
That's where lida and the others are...

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.399
Are they having a hard time?
We should go--

01:10:35.607 --> 01:10:36.733
You can't!

01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:40.695
Our job is to protect Katsuma and Mahoro.

01:10:42.072 --> 01:10:43.240
Mister Deku...

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:45.075
Bakugo...

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:57.838
I won't let you!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.218
Sero!

01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.223
I'll touch him and make him float!

01:11:12.853 --> 01:11:14.479
Uraraka!

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:17.691
Not... yet...

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.693
Bastard...

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.322
How could you?!

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:39.796
We're getting pushed back.

01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:42.757
At this rate, Katsuma and Mahoro...

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:45.969
Damn it...

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.027
Th-This is...

01:12:07.616 --> 01:12:10.494
There it is! His time limit!

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:20.879
That's some crazy power!

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:23.965
We can't even get close to him.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.469
My Recipro will be done soon.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.888
Make an opening for me.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.681
Get me close to him.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.642
And then?

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.644
I have an idea.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.021
All right.

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:40.273
This will be our last attack!

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:56.081
Iida, distract him with your Recipro Turbo!

01:13:11.263 --> 01:13:13.890
Doesn't this remind you of Camino?

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.100
Yeah.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:19.062
Whatever attack comes,
I'll take it and get you close to him for sure!

01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:20.522
Yeah!

01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:28.738
Unbreakable!

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:42.711
Kirishima!

01:13:47.966 --> 01:13:49.301
Go...

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:56.850
Increase the temperature in
your body to its maximum limit.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.229
What I could do with my flames...

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.231
...I'll do with my ice now!

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:13.533
Todoroki!

01:14:17.996 --> 01:14:20.832
Go down, as low as possible!

01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:26.171
Ribbit!

01:14:30.842 --> 01:14:33.261
Freeze!

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:55.325
Hibernate for a while...

01:14:56.785 --> 01:15:03.375
W-We've... done... our duty...

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:08.213
Midoriya... Bakugo...

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:18.556
Kacchan, let's attack in waves!

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:20.308
Don't give me orders!

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:25.188
I-If only I could get
the cell activation Quirk...

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.566
Let's get a sure hit in here!

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:33.488
...then I wouldn't have to conserve anything!

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.142
Mister Deku...

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.018
Bakugo...

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:09.816
--Mister Deku!
--Bakugo!

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:16.781
Activation of cells?

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.866
Yes.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:22.454
But I can only activate
the cells of type A blood.

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:25.623
It's not a Quirk that can really help anyone...

01:16:25.832 --> 01:16:28.042
Mr. Shimano, do you have any family?

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:32.255
I'm from Nabu Island,
and my daughter and son still live there...

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:34.257
That's pretty far,

01:16:34.466 --> 01:16:34.924
but Nabu Island is within
the culprit's range of progression.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.801
"Nabu Island"
but Nabu Island is within
the culprit's range of progression.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:37.260
"Nabu Island"

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:40.180
Excuse me.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:42.432
What is it?

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.895
A fishing boat sailing near
Kyushu received an S.0.S. message.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:50.148
Villains have attacked Nabu Island,
and they request help immediately.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.359
That's the suspect in the Quirk-loss crimes!

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:56.446
--What did you say?
--Send a rescue team to Nabu Island immediately!

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:59.073
Oh, and contact U.A. High School.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:01.409
U.A.? Why?

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:06.456
For the practical hero work recommendation
project sponsored by the commission,

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:12.045
the ones stationed at Nabu Island are
U.A. High School's hero course Class 1-A.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.966
Shoji, take Katsuma and Mahoro
and get out of here.

01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:18.593
Please.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.096
All right!

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:24.766
We'll definitely hold him back.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.392
Yeah.

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:31.439
Found you...

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:40.448
Heartbeat Distortion!

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.910
Twirling Tail Dance!

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:48.665
Ojiro!

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.844
I need to get to the escape route...

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:12.313
G-Get away...!

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:13.857
Run!

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.823
Both of you, run!

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:23.616
Hurry!

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:25.368
Go!

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.554
Katsuma, run away!

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:45.763
M-Mahoro?

01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:47.640
It's fine, just run away!

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.225
Don't come any closer!

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:51.853
Don't lay a hand on my little brother!

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.481
I said, don't come any closer!

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.943
Mahoro!

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:06.743
I-If you don't want her to die,

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.786
then come here.

01:19:08.995 --> 01:19:12.123
No, run away...

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:15.126
Run away!

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:18.546
Help me...

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:22.258
...turn my desire into reality...

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:25.219
Run... away...

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.972
Katsuma...

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.188
No!

01:19:35.396 --> 01:19:36.522
I will protect you!

01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:40.318
I will protect you, Mahoro!

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:50.286
Smash!

01:19:57.919 --> 01:19:59.337
Sorry I'm late!

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:01.130
Mister Deku...

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.925
You did a good job, Katsuma.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:05.969
You were amazing!

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:12.058
Bakugo... You're alive...

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:14.060
I told you, didn't I?

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:16.437
I'm the man who'll be even better than All Might

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:20.024
and become the number one hero.

01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:25.863
Run away with Mahoro!

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:27.365
Okay!

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.492
Mahoro!

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:40.044
How did you avoid my lightning...?!

01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:43.131
You used that on us already!

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:45.967
That's why

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.971
we used a useless idiot as a lightning rod.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.182
I-Isn't that a bit much?

01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:04.277
Smash!

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:06.988
Die!

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:14.328
Over here!

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:24.213
Th...

01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:27.341
This can't end!

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.095
It can't be the end!

01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:42.774
Like I'd let it end like this!

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:02.376
A tornado!

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.797
Damn, he really can change the weather...

01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:11.260
What should we do?

01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:13.137
Katsuma and Mahoro are still here...

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:17.016
On top of that, everyone who's
evacuated could be in danger, too!

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:22.605
Is he planning on destroying this whole island?

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.985
We definitely have to stop him!

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:33.741
One For All...

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:37.537
...100%!

01:22:37.745 --> 01:22:42.583
I'll blow that away with everything I've got!

01:22:43.209 --> 01:22:45.253
Detroit...

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.047
...Smash!

01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:50.675
Howitzer...

01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:53.678
...Impact!

01:22:58.099 --> 01:22:59.725
Mister Deku!

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.628
Mahoro!

01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:38.181
The entrance!

01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:43.978
--Sato!
--I can hold this. Get everyone further inside!

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:57.533
E-Even at 100%... it wasn't enough...

01:23:57.742 --> 01:23:59.994
D-Damn it...

01:24:00.203 --> 01:24:04.540
Even though I lowered myself to fight with Deku...

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:06.167
It's no use.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:09.503
You will not be able to live
with that level of power.

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:13.007
Not in the new world I will create.

01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:15.218
New world...?

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.512
Those who have power--

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:23.893
The strong will rule
over the weak in my utopia.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.103
That crap...

01:24:27.438 --> 01:24:30.733
It won't matter if someone
is a villain or a hero.

01:24:30.942 --> 01:24:34.487
Everything is equal before power...

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:36.280
That...

01:24:36.489 --> 01:24:40.826
...is what a true superhuman society should be.

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:46.916
With such a selfish assumption...

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:49.877
You're crazy...!

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.967
Are you getting in the way of the new world?

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:58.803
Then you should just disappear.

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:01.097
Think...

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.516
What would All Might do...?!

01:25:04.392 --> 01:25:08.854
L-Like I'd let it end here!

01:25:09.063 --> 01:25:12.608
Think... Think...

01:25:13.359 --> 01:25:15.778
I don't want to lose!

01:25:15.987 --> 01:25:17.863
Think...

01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:20.866
Mister Deku!

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:22.868
Bakugo!

01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:25.371
Mister Deku!

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:29.333
Don't lose!

01:25:30.543 --> 01:25:32.753
So that's where you were.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.508
Kacchan...

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.887
There's just one way...

01:25:42.096 --> 01:25:45.391
There's just one way we can do this...!

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.403
My Quirk was passed
on to me like a sacred torch.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:00.364
The power to transfer power...

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:10.207
K-Kacchan...

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:16.130
A hero has a lot to protect.

01:26:16.339 --> 01:26:20.009
That's why I won't lose!

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:23.346
Deku...

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.348
A hero...

01:26:25.556 --> 01:26:30.186
...can always break out of a tough spot!

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.941
A way we can protect...

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.029
A way we can win...

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:45.993
There's just one way...

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.554
What...?

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:12.603
If you do this,
will you still be able to use it?

01:27:12.812 --> 01:27:14.647
I don't know...

01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:16.524
But...

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:22.905
All Might still protected us with
the embers after he transferred it to me.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:26.158
What did you do?!

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:30.913
With two... One For Alls...

01:27:32.832 --> 01:27:34.792
...we'll save everyone!

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:38.838
...we'll win!

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:50.850
You two should already be dead...!

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:06.323
This is the end for your dream then, too, huh?

01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:10.870
It's fine. This is the only way.

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:13.956
Besides, I'm sure All Might

01:28:14.165 --> 01:28:17.084
would say that it's fine if it's you.

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:21.881
If it's you, who shared our secret...

01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:24.592
...who admired the same person as me...

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.385
If it's you...

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:31.765
All Might really is cool, isn't he?

01:28:33.017 --> 01:28:36.187
He's such a cool hero...

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:42.818
No matter what crisis is
in front of him, in the end...

01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:46.405
...he always wins!

01:28:46.614 --> 01:28:50.242
No matter what trouble they're in, he always...

01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:53.954
...saves everyone with a smile!

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:59.126
Don't make me laugh!

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:02.588
Detroit...

01:29:02.796 --> 01:29:08.093
...Smash!

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.459
Wh-What is this...?

01:29:40.668 --> 01:29:43.629
What is that power...?

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.345
Don't block...

01:29:51.554 --> 01:29:53.055
...my path!

01:29:54.473 --> 01:29:55.724
Kacchan, let's go!

01:29:55.933 --> 01:29:56.934
Huh?

01:29:57.142 --> 01:30:00.354
Don't give me orders!

01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:03.065
Don't get in my way!

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:46.335
This is...

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.796
...the last...

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:52.007
...that I'll produce...

01:31:52.216 --> 01:31:54.593
The last...

01:31:54.802 --> 01:32:00.683
...Smash!

01:32:20.285 --> 01:32:22.621
Goodbye...

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:26.208
...One For All...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.293
Thank you...

01:32:36.844 --> 01:32:38.804
Are you alive, Tokoyami?

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:44.393
Hawks... Why...?

01:32:45.853 --> 01:32:48.188
We came first to save you guys...

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:50.482
Me, and one other guy.

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:58.282
A-All Might...

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:02.411
Young Midoriya, sorry I'm late...

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:05.664
Wh-What about Kacchan...?

01:33:06.457 --> 01:33:10.836
You always worry about other people first...

01:33:11.044 --> 01:33:12.755
He's beat up, but he's fine.

01:33:12.963 --> 01:33:14.548
He'll live.

01:33:14.757 --> 01:33:16.800
I'm glad...

01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:21.346
I made him do something crazy...

01:33:21.555 --> 01:33:23.599
Young Bakugo?

01:33:25.768 --> 01:33:29.480
All Might...

01:33:29.688 --> 01:33:33.150
I-1 transferred it...

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:37.279
One For All... to Kacchan...

01:33:37.488 --> 01:33:39.698
One For All?!

01:33:39.907 --> 01:33:43.368
If we didn't use two One For Alls,

01:33:43.577 --> 01:33:48.207
then we couldn't save
the people of the island...

01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:51.627
We couldn't have defeated the villain...

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:55.839
That's why... I don't regret it...

01:33:56.048 --> 01:33:58.425
But, I'm sorry...

01:33:58.634 --> 01:34:02.304
Even though you chose me
as your successor...

01:34:02.513 --> 01:34:05.849
Even though you said I could become a hero...

01:34:07.476 --> 01:34:12.147
But I wanted to protect
everyone no matter what...!

01:34:13.524 --> 01:34:15.984
Young Midoriya...

01:34:16.193 --> 01:34:20.072
I'm sorry, All Might...

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.949
I'm sorry...

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:25.619
But I...

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:40.050
Young Midoriya, I don't regret
giving you One For All one bit...

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:43.887
You used it correctly...

01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:46.932
The hearts of the brave
that have been spun together...

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.143
The power that is the crystallization of that...

01:35:04.658 --> 01:35:06.869
One For All...

01:35:08.996 --> 01:35:14.459
Before the transfer finished,
because Young Bakugo lost consciousness...

01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:18.463
No, that's not it.

01:35:18.672 --> 01:35:21.383
For the one who risked his life to protect

01:35:21.592 --> 01:35:24.970
and the one who risked his life to win...

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:28.682
...One For All gave them a miracle...

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:37.983
Master... All the predecessors...

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:44.531
Thank you very much...

01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:37.709
What are you planning...

01:36:37.918 --> 01:36:39.544
...Tomura Shigaraki?

01:36:45.676 --> 01:36:48.804
You were alive, as I thought.

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:51.139
Shigaraki...

01:36:51.348 --> 01:36:54.059
Did you have a good life?

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:57.437
It's only begun... It's only...

01:36:57.646 --> 01:37:01.900
Don't worry. I'll take over your dream.

01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:06.738
There only needs to be one ruler...

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:11.785
That's right... only one...

01:37:13.662 --> 01:37:15.414
Good night, Nine...

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.418
Good work.

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:27.050
Ow...!

01:37:27.259 --> 01:37:29.136
What the hell happened?!

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:31.722
Kiss...!

01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:33.598
"Undergoing Treatment"

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:37.728
"Undergoing Treatment"
Kacchan doesn't remember anything
about the transfer of One For All,

01:37:37.728 --> 01:37:38.645
Kacchan doesn't remember anything
about the transfer of One For All,

01:37:38.854 --> 01:37:42.733
and even now, One For All lives inside me.

01:37:42.733 --> 01:37:42.858
"Nabu Port Terminal"
and even now, One For All lives inside me.

01:37:42.858 --> 01:37:44.693
"Nabu Port Terminal"

01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:46.445
Daddy!

01:37:46.653 --> 01:37:49.114
Mahoro! Katsuma!

01:37:50.449 --> 01:37:56.038
Later, Katsuma and Mahoro were
able to reunite with their father.

01:37:57.748 --> 01:38:01.668
For this incident, we were able
to protect everyone on the island,

01:38:01.877 --> 01:38:04.838
but there was a lot of damage.

01:38:05.047 --> 01:38:09.885
The Heroes Public Safety Commission
immediately suspended the program,

01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:12.596
but we stayed on the island
until we were scheduled to leave

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:15.682
to help with recovery efforts.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:21.313
And then, the last day
of the program arrived...

01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:24.524
Shouldn't we say something before we leave?

01:38:24.733 --> 01:38:25.776
Right?

01:38:25.984 --> 01:38:28.528
We shouldn't get in the way of their rebuilding.

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:30.906
Well, I guess leaving without a word...

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:32.491
...is also pretty hero-like.

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:33.992
Yes.

01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:38.205
It's time to say goodbye to this island, huh?

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:40.499
Good riddance.

01:38:53.637 --> 01:38:57.057
You don't need to say bye to those kids?

01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:00.018
There are things I wanted to tell them,

01:39:00.227 --> 01:39:01.478
but it's fine...

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:04.564
I'm sure they already know what they are.

01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:06.233
Hey!

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:08.276
Hey!

01:39:08.485 --> 01:39:10.153
Mister Deku!

01:39:10.362 --> 01:39:11.988
Bakugo!

01:39:12.197 --> 01:39:14.324
Everyone!

01:39:14.533 --> 01:39:17.327
Thanks for protecting everyone...

01:39:17.536 --> 01:39:20.247
...on the island!

01:39:21.206 --> 01:39:25.627
Mister Deku, I'll get stronger!

01:39:25.836 --> 01:39:30.507
Strong enough to protect Daddy and Mahoro!

01:39:32.968 --> 01:39:39.975
And then, I'll become
a cool hero like you and Bakugo!

01:39:41.268 --> 01:39:45.522
Don't forget that, damn kid.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.816
Katsuma!

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:49.401
You...

01:39:49.609 --> 01:39:52.946
You can become a hero!

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:58.285
I'll be waiting for you at U.A.!

01:40:33.695 --> 01:40:37.657
Come, the time for beginnings is at hand

01:40:37.866 --> 01:40:43.079
It's goodbye to those tear-filled nights

01:40:43.288 --> 01:40:51.755
One banner for the world
that's raised My Gloria anew

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:58.136
Start walking and,
in time, a wind will surely arise

01:40:58.345 --> 01:41:03.808
Banner aflutter, let's advance

01:41:04.017 --> 01:41:06.853
Come, it's nice to meet you

01:41:07.062 --> 01:41:09.940
This story that's awakened

01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:13.360
No more hesitation

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.445
Start walking

01:41:15.654 --> 01:41:18.865
This story of a dawning

01:41:19.074 --> 01:41:23.954
Even farther beyond

01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:33.880
Walking blind and dazzled

01:41:34.089 --> 01:41:39.302
The countless banners at
the end of a headlong plunge

01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:42.430
Not a single one like another

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:47.727
Yet each a banner raised with pride

01:41:47.936 --> 01:41:51.481
Neither ingratiating nor playful

01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:59.948
We're simply travelers going to the same place

01:42:00.156 --> 01:42:02.993
Hey, start building

01:42:03.201 --> 01:42:06.162
This glory we fell in love with

01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:09.499
Let us go together

01:42:09.708 --> 01:42:14.963
Walking side by side, in accord, to this parade

01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:18.800
Even farther beyond

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:37.068
Though morning may birth shadows

01:42:37.277 --> 01:42:39.195
And hope may grow ill

01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:42.991
Just keep your faith in the here and now

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:47.078
In the resolve that shines in each of us

01:42:47.287 --> 01:42:52.500
March for our cause

01:42:54.336 --> 01:42:57.088
Hey, start building

01:42:57.297 --> 01:43:00.342
This story of freedom

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:03.511
No more hesitation

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.933
Be wrong with one another
to this parade of the dawning

01:43:09.142 --> 01:43:12.187
Let us go together

01:43:12.395 --> 01:43:17.484
'Til the day the world ends

01:43:17.692 --> 01:43:20.779
Let us keep raising the banner

01:43:20.987 --> 01:43:26.201
Light up one another, transcending even destiny

01:43:26.409 --> 01:43:31.081
Even farther beyond

01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:39.839
Us to the beyond

01:43:43.885 --> 01:43:48.681
All the way beyond
