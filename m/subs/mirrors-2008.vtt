01:50.310 --> 01:51.800
Oh, fuck!

02:37.690 --> 02:39.555
I wasn't trying to escape.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.007
No, please.
Don't.

02:51.571 --> 02:55.007
Oh, God. I don't want to die.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.204
Yeah. Yeah, I'll make you clean.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.386
I'm sorry.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.222
I didn't mean to...

06:52.478 --> 06:53.809
Hey, sis.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.007
What time is it?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.743
Just after 8:00.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.110
You want me to make coffee?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.779
No, I gotta go. I'll call you later.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.279
You sure there's nothing I can do?

07:04.357 --> 07:07.918
Angie, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go back to sleep.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.502
<i>All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

07:57.543 --> 07:58.874
Ben Carson.

07:58.945 --> 08:03.143
Lorenzo Sapelli. I've been waiting for you.
Come on in.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.205
Thanks.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.390
How long you been working here?

08:12.458 --> 08:16.258
All together? Fifteen years.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.562
You were here for the fire?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.031
Devastating.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.503
Entire building up in flames.

08:36.414 --> 08:39.111
It has been five years since the fire.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.916
They're still in a legal battle
with the insurance companies.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.447
Even cleaning up this mess is impossible.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.689
I've given up faith about reopening,
and besides,

08:49.762 --> 08:53.664
who'd ever want to shop here
after everything that's happened?

08:54.567 --> 08:57.536
You know, the Meredith family
acquired this building

08:57.603 --> 09:01.198
after St. Matthew's Hospital
closed in 1952.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.605
It was the very first Mayflower
to open on the East Coast.

09:07.513 --> 09:11.973
Yeah, the company wants us to patrol
the premises every couple of hours,

09:12.051 --> 09:15.885
but I do my rounds every three.
That's more than enough.

09:15.955 --> 09:20.790
Anyway, you'll see, not too much
going on. It's pretty calm around here.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.757
Well, there you go.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.231
Perfume and cosmetics department,
what's left of it anyway.

09:35.308 --> 09:40.371
Thank God you didn't show up any later.
This place gives me the creeps at night.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.004
No electricity.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.677
All these mirrors.

09:45.551 --> 09:48.987
- Best to keep your eyes away from them.
- You polish them?

09:49.288 --> 09:52.189
- I'm sorry?
- The mirrors, they're so clean.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.318
No, that's Gary. Gary Lewis.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.828
Fellow who was working here before you.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.365
He was completely obsessed
with these damn mirrors.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.833
Spent the entire night cleaning them.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.639
How long has it been
since you left the NYPD?

10:10.142 --> 10:11.973
About a year.

10:12.044 --> 10:16.674
I know it's none of my business,
but why did you resign from the force?

10:17.617 --> 10:20.552
You used to be a detective,
is that correct?

10:21.087 --> 10:22.247
Yeah.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.583
I'm sorry.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.955
I always been too curious.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.550
It's all right.

10:36.869 --> 10:40.498
There was a pretty big team
working here before the fire.

10:40.573 --> 10:44.703
You know, when you stop to think,
of all the department stores in New York,

10:44.777 --> 10:48.213
this one was the most beautiful,
most luxurious.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.208
I mean, it breaks your heart, it really does.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.748
Well, here you go.

10:55.421 --> 10:58.117
This is where you'll be spending
most of your time.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.023
At least you got electricity in here.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.527
It's warm. It's nice.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.029
You've even got a TV.

11:18.811 --> 11:22.474
<i>I opened up the trunk,</i>
<i>which he so called hid the pictures.</i>

11:22.548 --> 11:25.415
<i>I grabbed the goody bag,</i>
<i>walked to the backyard,</i>

11:25.484 --> 11:29.545
<i>opened up the barbecue grill,</i>
<i>I grabbed the lighter fluid,</i>

11:29.622 --> 11:31.351
Waiting to Exhale.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.856
Hello?

11:35.061 --> 11:36.085
Hello.

11:36.162 --> 11:39.131
- Hey, Rosa, how are you doing?
- I'm fine. Let me help you.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.563
Thanks.

11:41.734 --> 11:42.860
Where are the kids?

11:42.935 --> 11:45.529
Upstairs with <i>Se√±or</i> Ben.

11:47.606 --> 11:48.834
Thanks.

11:48.908 --> 11:52.537
So everybody at my school
thinks this boy named Eamon,

11:52.611 --> 11:57.105
which is, like, one of my best friends,
which is a boy, likes me.

11:57.183 --> 12:01.677
And this girl named Christiana,
who liked him, is just now gossiping.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.119
You want me to talk to Mrs. Ward?

12:03.189 --> 12:07.888
She'll make them want to wrap me up
in toilet paper for Halloween.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.757
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.024
Look, Mommy. Look what Daddy got me.

12:12.098 --> 12:15.192
It looks great. You'll have to show me
how it works later, okay?

12:15.267 --> 12:17.531
It's so fast, Mommy.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.764
Ben? Can I talk to you?

12:20.639 --> 12:23.767
Yeah. Okay, you two.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.141
You need to finish your homework.
You need to get ready for your bath.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.702
Come on. No fooling around, let's go.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.805
Okay, let's go, Michael.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.477
Hey. Come here.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.248
Happy, happy birthday.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.119
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.871
- What is this?
- What?

12:56.942 --> 12:59.410
I've asked you
not to drop by without calling.

12:59.478 --> 13:00.843
You won't answer my calls.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.346
Please, Ben,
I don't want to argue with you.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.815
I don't want to argue, either. If you're not
gonna answer my calls, what...

13:09.054 --> 13:10.646
I haven't had a drink
for over three months,

13:10.723 --> 13:12.987
but since you won't answer your calls,
how would you know?

13:13.058 --> 13:14.650
I don't want to know.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.758
What I want is for you
to respect my needs.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.423
Amy, I'm doing everything I can
to respect your needs.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.557
I haven't had a drink.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.000
I got a new job to hold me over
till I'm reinstated.

13:24.069 --> 13:27.596
I'm doing everything I can
to get back on my feet again.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.439
What?

13:32.545 --> 13:34.376
You don't think people can change?

13:34.446 --> 13:37.973
We're not talking about people.
We're talking about you.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.041
Amy, I killed a man.

13:40.619 --> 13:42.814
You don't just get over that.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.856
I needed time. I needed you.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.824
- I was right here.
- Yeah.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.359
Judging me like everybody else.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.588
How dare you say that to me?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.131
I was the only one at the precinct
who defended you.

13:53.199 --> 13:56.464
How many times did I chase reporters
off our front lawn?

13:56.535 --> 13:59.060
How can you say that to me?

13:59.138 --> 14:00.332
I've always been in your corner!

14:00.406 --> 14:02.306
I've been the only one
who believed in you!

14:02.374 --> 14:04.205
You're fucking unbelievable!

14:04.276 --> 14:06.244
Please, I didn't come here to fight.

14:06.312 --> 14:09.611
Look, I'm sorry that I came over
without calling.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.946
I just wanted to see them.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.246
But we have to set up some rules.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.254
What fucking rules?

14:16.322 --> 14:18.882
Come on, Amy,
just tell me what rules I need to follow

14:18.958 --> 14:21.552
so I can see my son on his birthday!

14:22.294 --> 14:23.818
Look at yourself.

14:25.264 --> 14:28.028
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

14:28.100 --> 14:32.196
I don't know how you're going to be
from one moment to the next.

14:32.271 --> 14:36.833
When I get around you, I get nervous.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.935
Because I am so scared
that I am losing you.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.772
And I screw everything up.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.946
- I've missed you so much.
- I miss you, too.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.721
Amy, we deserve another chance.

14:51.790 --> 14:56.523
I know how much I love you, and I know
somewhere inside there, you love me, too.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.191
Please.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.233
Please.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.209
I can't do this.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.581
I can't do this, Ben.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.716
Fuck.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.501
Holy shit.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.952
What the hell?

20:49.281 --> 20:50.407
Fuck!

20:51.550 --> 20:52.847
Man.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.587
What the...

21:48.373 --> 21:50.739
- You should stop taking those pills.
- Jesus!

21:53.578 --> 21:55.637
How are you doing today?

21:56.648 --> 22:00.812
I'm fine. I feel a lot better.
I'm leaving in a couple of minutes.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.045
Are you sure you're all right?

22:04.122 --> 22:05.316
Please, not you.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.518
Okay. I'm just saying,
you can talk to me if you want.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.458
I'm your little sister.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.854
It's that new job, isn't it?

22:13.932 --> 22:16.560
Yeah, well, I need that new job.

22:16.635 --> 22:20.731
I can't take care of Amy and the kids
and myself on my pension.

22:20.806 --> 22:24.105
I'm not gonna sleep on your couch
for the rest of my life.

22:24.176 --> 22:28.840
Okay, well, maybe you get a daytime job,
a regular job.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.677
It's not that simple.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.582
Well, you should think about it.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.133
Ben! What happened?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.598
Just leave me alone.
Please, just leave me alone!

22:52.671 --> 22:54.764
Angie, get out of here! Now!

23:21.666 --> 23:23.759
What is happening to you, Ben?

23:24.369 --> 23:26.667
Pull yourself together.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.071
Help!

26:24.249 --> 26:27.480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...

26:27.552 --> 26:28.917
No!

27:33.918 --> 27:35.317
"Gary Lewis."

28:47.592 --> 28:48.820
Esseker.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.718
Esseker.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.346
Hello?

30:20.618 --> 30:21.949
Hello?

30:24.155 --> 30:26.123
Where are you?

30:26.191 --> 30:29.524
I want to help you,
but I need to know where you are!

30:29.594 --> 30:30.959
Damn it!

30:36.267 --> 30:37.632
I'm coming!

31:04.162 --> 31:05.493
Anybody here?

31:08.132 --> 31:09.724
Is anybody in here?

32:01.386 --> 32:03.286
Fuck this place.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.770
Mom! Mom! Mom!

33:26.838 --> 33:29.398
- Mom! Mom!
- Michael?

33:29.474 --> 33:32.136
Are you okay? What's happening?

33:32.210 --> 33:34.735
Michael. What's the matter, sweetie?

33:35.446 --> 33:37.607
- There's a lady screaming.
- Where?

33:37.682 --> 33:41.174
- There, in the mirror.
- In the mirror?

33:41.552 --> 33:43.782
I don't see anybody
but you and I in the mirror.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.153
- You just had a nightmare, sweetie.
- Okay.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.522
Sometimes they can feel really real,
but they're not, all right?

33:48.593 --> 33:50.686
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go back to sleep.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.390
Come on. In you go.

33:53.464 --> 33:56.262
I'm right around the corner, all right?

33:56.334 --> 33:59.132
- Love you.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.708
- Can you leave the door open?
- Sure, sweetheart.

34:04.776 --> 34:08.007
- But you go back to sleep, okay?
- All right, Mom.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.842
<i>... not clear how it happened.</i>

34:09.914 --> 34:13.371
<i>The 42-year-old is expected to go</i>
<i>on trial this month for allegedly</i>

34:13.451 --> 34:16.351
<i>sexually assaulting a former co-worker</i>
<i>in her apartment</i>

34:16.420 --> 34:19.857
<i>for 13 hours on Halloween night in 2005.</i>

34:19.924 --> 34:23.951
<i>Braunstein's lawyer says his client</i>
<i>was mentally ill at the time.</i>

34:24.195 --> 34:27.824
<i>The Feds say they'll seek the death</i>
<i>penalty against a former mob boss</i>

34:27.899 --> 34:30.129
<i>accused of ordering a hit on a rival.</i>

34:30.201 --> 34:32.192
<i>The trial of Vincent "Vinny Gorgeous"...</i>

34:54.592 --> 34:57.152
I swear to you,
I could feel my flesh burning.

34:57.228 --> 35:00.425
I couldn't breathe.
It was like my lungs were full of smoke.

35:00.498 --> 35:04.264
It was like a nightmare, but I was awake.
I know I was awake.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.972
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?
- I don't know what to think.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.065
I think you're just going through
a hard time in your life.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.303
You're under a lot of stress.

35:13.377 --> 35:16.869
You've been having those nightmares
since the shooting.

35:20.384 --> 35:23.717
- You know it wasn't your fault.
- They're everywhere.

35:24.589 --> 35:28.047
- What are you talking about?
- The fucking mirrors, they are everywhere,

35:28.126 --> 35:29.923
in the department store,
on the corner of every street,

35:29.994 --> 35:32.895
in the window of every building
in this city.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.454
I feel...

35:36.033 --> 35:40.367
I feel like I'm not the one
looking into the mirrors

35:40.438 --> 35:42.770
but they're looking back at me.

35:44.408 --> 35:47.935
There's no one looking back at you
through the mirrors.

35:49.013 --> 35:53.143
You're obviously... You're still conflicted
about what happened.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.347
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

35:58.556 --> 36:00.615
A professional, someone...

36:03.661 --> 36:06.789
Mirrors are just glass and silver, Ben.
That's it.

36:06.864 --> 36:08.855
There's nothing behind them.

36:11.235 --> 36:14.068
Will you please go get some sleep, okay?

36:15.139 --> 36:16.606
I love you.

36:31.289 --> 36:32.620
Coming!

36:35.993 --> 36:37.324
Hold on!

36:45.269 --> 36:47.464
- Mr. Carson?
- Yeah.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.870
You want to sign here, please?

36:55.079 --> 36:57.445
- You have a good day, sir.
- Thanks.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.223
Holy shit.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.987
Lorenzo, I need to talk to you.

38:21.065 --> 38:24.967
I just had the craziest day here.
Your ex-colleagues came to pay us a visit.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.094
What are you talking about?

38:26.170 --> 38:28.638
Well, you know Gary, the guy
who was working here before you?

38:28.706 --> 38:29.764
Yeah.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.003
Cops found him dead
in a subway station in Harlem.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.638
I never liked him too much, but,
poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.375
Did they happen to tell you
the cause of death?

38:38.449 --> 38:40.314
- What?
- Did they tell you how he died?

38:40.384 --> 38:42.215
No, no, they wouldn't tell me.

38:42.286 --> 38:45.187
Mrs. Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
I got to go.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.486
By the way,
about that leak in the basement.

38:47.558 --> 38:51.858
They're sending someone over
to work on that, beginning of next week.

39:20.558 --> 39:24.722
We have a white male, 50 years of age,
name unknown.

39:25.563 --> 39:28.031
Following the completion
of the external examination,

39:28.099 --> 39:30.659
the body was washed and lightly dried.

39:30.735 --> 39:34.501
A Y-incision was made
from the bilateral clavicular joints

39:34.572 --> 39:36.699
to the xiphoid process.

39:36.774 --> 39:39.299
- The tissue was waterlogged...
- Amy.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.639
Yes, what is it?

39:40.711 --> 39:44.203
There's someone in the lobby for you.
It sounds urgent.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.019
Ben.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.422
What's happening?
What are you doing here?

39:55.493 --> 39:58.326
Thanks for seeing me.
Look, I need to ask you a favor.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.024
- I'm in the middle of work.
- I know. Twenty minutes.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.293
Yesterday morning you picked up a body.

40:03.367 --> 40:06.427
Gary Lewis.
I just need to take a look at him.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.201
- Who is he?
- He was a night watchman

40:08.272 --> 40:10.570
at the Mayflower. I replaced him.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.108
How do you have his driver's license?

40:12.176 --> 40:16.169
I found his wallet in the department store.
Look, I just need to know how he died.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.949
Why do you need to know how he died?

40:19.016 --> 40:21.780
Ben, you've been suspended. You're not
supposed to be doing any investigations.

40:21.852 --> 40:23.911
Amy, please, just listen to me.
This is serious.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.889
There are some very strange things
happening over at the Mayflower.

40:26.957 --> 40:29.084
I can't explain, but it's...

40:30.227 --> 40:33.196
This guy Gary Lewis sent me a package
right before he died.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.232
Thing is, I never met him before.

40:35.299 --> 40:38.462
Inside the package were all these articles
on the Mayflower, on the fire.

40:38.536 --> 40:42.165
It was like he was trying to tell me
something or warn me about something.

40:42.239 --> 40:44.434
I need to figure this out. Please.

40:44.508 --> 40:48.171
Gary Lewis, Gary Lewis. There he is, B-16.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.041
He slashed his throat.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.447
There you go, there's your answer.
Your man committed suicide.

40:53.517 --> 40:58.147
And you get a lot of suicide cases
with people that slash their own throats?

40:59.056 --> 41:02.048
I didn't think so. Excuse me.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.425
All I know is,
the police are still investigating this one.

41:05.496 --> 41:06.793
That's why we still have the body.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.389
What did he use to cut his throat?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.298
A piece of mirror.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.467
He probably broke the mirror into pieces

41:14.538 --> 41:17.200
so he'd have something
to cut himself with.

41:17.274 --> 41:19.105
Seven years bad luck.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.637
Esseker.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.544
Are you okay, Ben?

41:25.249 --> 41:26.580
I'm fine.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.521
I'm sorry, excuse me.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.659
I need to see his file.

41:36.727 --> 41:38.592
- What?
- I need his file.

41:38.662 --> 41:39.686
- Ben.
- What's the problem?

41:39.763 --> 41:40.821
I just need to see his file.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.729
Calm down. You're not even
supposed to be down here,

41:42.800 --> 41:45.064
and now you want to
look at somebody's file?

41:45.135 --> 41:46.966
Look, I'll be off then.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.267
Amy, you know where to find me
if you need me.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.968
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

41:57.214 --> 42:01.048
- I want you to leave now. I'm serious, Ben.
- Amy, I'm sorry.

42:01.452 --> 42:04.216
I can't leave here until I see that file.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.781
It's important, please.

42:08.158 --> 42:09.455
Please.

42:37.621 --> 42:40.784
Amy, come here and look at this picture.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.986
Look at the piece of mirror
that Gary Lewis is holding.

42:47.064 --> 42:51.125
And look at it up here
in its reflected image in the other mirror.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.033
It's full of blood.

42:54.104 --> 42:58.063
Yet in reality, it's perfectly clean.
Not a single drop, not a single drop on it.

42:58.142 --> 43:00.576
So what? It's probably the angle
from which the photograph was taken.

43:00.644 --> 43:02.669
What are you trying to prove?

43:02.746 --> 43:05.579
What if the mirrors are showing us
something that's not really happening?

43:05.649 --> 43:08.311
- What are you talking about?
- No, just listen to me.

43:08.385 --> 43:13.186
What if the mirrors are reflecting
something that's beyond our reality?

43:13.257 --> 43:15.851
What if the mirrors can actually make us
do things that we don't want to do?

43:15.926 --> 43:17.621
Like making Gary Lewis
slit his own throat.

43:17.695 --> 43:21.529
Ben, listen to yourself.
You can't talk like that around here.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.760
Don't you want to get reinstated?

43:23.834 --> 43:27.668
Amy, I'm seeing things in the mirrors
at work, bad things,

43:27.738 --> 43:29.968
to the point where I can feel
what they're showing me.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.840
Ben, you're driving me fucking crazy!
I don't have time for this.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.037
What's wrong with you?

43:35.112 --> 43:39.014
Do you think I'm making this up?
Do you think I'm fucking lying?

43:41.485 --> 43:44.818
What medication are you taking
to stop drinking?

44:01.438 --> 44:03.303
That's a strong drug.

44:03.874 --> 44:08.402
It has a lot of serious side effects.
How many pills are you taking a day?

44:11.915 --> 44:14.281
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

44:15.052 --> 44:16.485
You're right.

44:17.755 --> 44:19.780
Thanks for trying to help.

46:27.985 --> 46:30.078
...night at this bar.
It's a couple of blocks from here.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.315
- All right. Where's the body?
- Calm down.

46:32.389 --> 46:35.051
- I can't. How am I gonna calm down?
- Let the detective by. Step over here.

46:35.125 --> 46:38.026
And there's a guy been living with her
at her place. There's a guy.

46:38.095 --> 46:41.656
All right. You say she works at this bar?
At night?

46:41.732 --> 46:43.723
Yeah, she works nights. She goes nights.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.133
She comes home late.
I don't see her come home.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.727
She probably closes the bar, right?

46:47.805 --> 46:51.366
Yeah. 'Cause she sleeps during the day,
like early morning hours.

46:51.441 --> 46:52.806
All right.

47:18.535 --> 47:23.131
I saw blood falling from the ceiling.
Then she call me.

47:23.207 --> 47:26.574
I want you to ask her,
did she hear any noises, any sounds?

47:26.643 --> 47:27.837
- What's going on?
- One second.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.607
It's all right, I live in apartment eight.
I used to be a cop.

47:30.681 --> 47:33.241
- Just tell me what's going on.
- Just a second.

47:33.317 --> 47:36.377
I want to talk to the lead detective!
Angela!

47:36.453 --> 47:39.479
- Who is the lead detective?
- Ben.

47:39.890 --> 47:42.654
Larry, what the hell are you doing here?

47:43.393 --> 47:46.954
- Larry, just tell me what's going on.
- Ben, it's not good.

47:47.030 --> 47:48.657
Where's Angie?

47:50.434 --> 47:53.528
Where the fuck is my sister?
Tell them to let go of me!

47:53.604 --> 47:56.004
- I can't do that, Ben!
- God damn it!

48:39.616 --> 48:42.449
<i>The water has obliterated</i>
<i>most of the marks.</i>

48:42.719 --> 48:45.552
No sign of struggle or forced entry.

48:46.056 --> 48:49.457
And the front door was locked,
which means that

48:49.526 --> 48:51.619
the person who did this
either had keys to the apartment

48:51.695 --> 48:53.925
or it was someone that she knew.

48:53.997 --> 48:56.693
He would've never laid a finger on her.

48:57.467 --> 49:01.164
You know, when their father died,
Ben took care of Angela.

49:03.607 --> 49:04.665
She meant the world to him.

49:04.741 --> 49:08.700
Listen, so far, his statement is pretty
consistent with the facts, you know?

49:08.779 --> 49:11.771
We checked it out.
He showed up to work at 7:00 p.m.

49:11.848 --> 49:13.076
And the downstairs neighbors said

49:13.150 --> 49:16.347
they began to notice the water leakage
at around 10:00.

49:16.420 --> 49:19.480
The only strange thing,
and this could just be a coincidence,

49:19.556 --> 49:23.492
is that Ben told the daytime
security guard, Lorenzo Sapelli,

49:23.560 --> 49:26.324
that he was planning on quitting the job.

49:26.396 --> 49:31.060
Like he was moving away someplace.
He mention anything like that to you?

49:31.134 --> 49:32.294
No.

49:33.637 --> 49:36.970
Lately, communication hasn't been
our strong point.

49:37.574 --> 49:38.802
What are you gonna do with him?

49:38.875 --> 49:40.866
I figure we'll let him go.
We got no reason to keep him here.

49:40.944 --> 49:42.275
Larry.

49:55.125 --> 49:56.786
I'm so sorry.

49:58.362 --> 49:59.886
Ben?

49:59.963 --> 50:02.898
Why don't you come home
and spend some days with the kids?

50:02.966 --> 50:04.490
I can't.

50:05.302 --> 50:08.271
I don't want to put our children in danger.

50:09.306 --> 50:11.866
She asked me to quit, but I wouldn't.

50:13.176 --> 50:17.044
- They came after her.
- What are you talking about?

50:19.916 --> 50:22.612
I've got some things I need to take care of.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.814
- Wait, Ben. Please.
- Amy. Amy, let me go.

50:25.889 --> 50:27.379
I don't want you
to get in any more trouble.

50:27.457 --> 50:30.984
- Please stay out of it.
- I know who did this.

50:31.061 --> 50:34.622
Well, in that case,
you've got to tell Larry everything.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.191
He'll never believe me.

50:40.904 --> 50:42.565
Neither will you.

52:04.721 --> 52:06.746
What do you want?

52:06.823 --> 52:08.688
Please, just tell me.

52:09.392 --> 52:11.622
What do you want from me?

52:16.533 --> 52:19.001
What do you want from me?

52:39.523 --> 52:41.548
"Esseker."

52:46.363 --> 52:50.060
Hey. I need you to run a name for me.
Esseker.

52:50.133 --> 52:55.002
Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo,
Kilo, Echo, Romeo.

52:55.071 --> 52:58.563
<i>- Did you check online?</i>
- I've already done that.

52:58.642 --> 53:01.202
Nothing. IRS and DMV.

53:01.278 --> 53:03.143
<i>- Where?</i>
- Try New York.

53:03.213 --> 53:04.840
<i>- When?</i>
- Last five or six years.

53:04.915 --> 53:06.246
<i>Okay, Ben.</i>

53:06.316 --> 53:08.841
Thanks.
Get back to me as soon as you can.

53:10.654 --> 53:13.521
"Mayflower burns, 48 presumed dead."

53:15.725 --> 53:18.523
"Berry confesses to
deadly Mayflower fire."

53:23.867 --> 53:25.801
"Watchman arrested."

53:27.938 --> 53:31.738
"Woman, three children murdered."
Come on, Ben, connect the dots.

53:31.808 --> 53:34.072
"Mr. Berry maintains that
the mirrors in the store are the ones

53:34.144 --> 53:37.307
"that brutally killed his wife
and three children."

53:41.651 --> 53:44.381
"Mirrors are guilty. Mirrors are guilty."

53:45.088 --> 53:47.579
- Yeah. What did you get?
<i>- Hey.</i>

53:47.657 --> 53:50.490
<i>Look, I didn't find anything</i>
<i>under that name.</i>

53:50.560 --> 53:53.154
Shit! Shit.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.790
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to look outside New York?</i>

53:55.865 --> 53:58.459
No. Hold on. Hold on.

54:02.372 --> 54:05.933
I want you to run another name for me.
Berry, Terrence Berry.

54:06.009 --> 54:08.477
<i>Terrence Berry.</i>

54:09.412 --> 54:10.640
<i>Wait one sec.</i>

54:13.917 --> 54:17.375
<i>- I think I got him. You still there?</i>
- Yeah.

54:18.188 --> 54:21.646
<i>- Your guy murdered his whole family.</i>
- I already know that.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.124
<i>He's dead.</i>

54:24.661 --> 54:25.992
Damn it.

54:27.731 --> 54:30.564
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

54:33.503 --> 54:36.802
You know, Mr. Carson, when one
starts to perceive one's own reflection

54:36.873 --> 54:38.738
as a completely separate being,

54:38.808 --> 54:42.005
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

54:42.078 --> 54:45.775
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

54:45.849 --> 54:49.148
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

54:49.219 --> 54:51.050
can split the personality in two.

54:51.121 --> 54:54.420
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

54:54.491 --> 54:58.086
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

54:58.161 --> 55:02.564
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

55:02.632 --> 55:06.898
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

55:11.741 --> 55:14.403
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

55:17.714 --> 55:19.579
You'll see they speak for themselves.

55:23.887 --> 55:25.821
<i>Why did you set</i>
<i>the department store on fire?</i>

55:25.889 --> 55:29.052
<i>In order to destroy the mirrors.</i>

55:30.994 --> 55:34.555
<i>Only fire can destroy mirrors,</i>
<i>isn't that right, Doctor?</i>

55:35.665 --> 55:40.159
<i>What made you think you absolutely</i>
<i>had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?</i>

55:43.807 --> 55:48.744
<i>They killed my Helen</i>
<i>and my three children.</i>

55:49.512 --> 55:50.911
<i>For what reason?</i>

55:50.980 --> 55:52.379
<i>Why would mirrors</i>
<i>want to kill your family?</i>

55:52.449 --> 55:55.145
<i>- Because I didn't...</i>
<i>- Didn't do what?</i>

55:57.587 --> 55:59.316
<i>They asked me to find Esseker.</i>

55:59.389 --> 56:00.413
Oh, my God.

56:00.490 --> 56:02.287
<i>We all are looking for Esseker.</i>

56:02.359 --> 56:04.054
Amy.

56:04.127 --> 56:06.186
Excuse me, I have to go.

56:07.530 --> 56:12.160
<i>Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.</i>
<i>Who is Esseker?</i>

56:12.235 --> 56:14.897
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

56:15.939 --> 56:18.601
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

56:20.243 --> 56:21.540
<i>I don't know.</i>

56:29.853 --> 56:31.980
Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

56:32.655 --> 56:37.524
Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

57:10.794 --> 57:13.558
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

57:13.630 --> 57:15.894
Good. I'll be right back.

57:27.510 --> 57:28.534
Dad...

57:28.611 --> 57:32.240
Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

57:54.771 --> 57:56.864
Daddy, what are you doing?

57:59.742 --> 58:02.040
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

58:02.111 --> 58:05.012
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

58:21.464 --> 58:23.557
Rosa, what's happening?

58:23.867 --> 58:27.064
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

58:27.604 --> 58:28.696
What the hell are you doing?

58:28.771 --> 58:30.966
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.406
Get out of the house, right now!

58:33.510 --> 58:36.570
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

58:36.646 --> 58:38.136
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

58:38.214 --> 58:40.182
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

58:40.250 --> 58:42.616
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

58:42.685 --> 58:45.677
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

58:45.755 --> 58:47.052
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

58:47.123 --> 58:51.059
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

58:51.127 --> 58:53.061
What's wrong with you?

58:54.264 --> 58:56.357
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

58:56.432 --> 59:00.027
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

59:00.103 --> 59:03.095
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

59:03.172 --> 59:06.005
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

59:06.075 --> 59:09.841
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

59:09.913 --> 59:13.940
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

59:14.017 --> 59:16.884
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

59:16.953 --> 59:19.888
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

59:20.123 --> 59:22.353
I want to show you something.

59:25.161 --> 59:26.753
- Ben, let go of me!
- You don't want to believe me?

59:26.829 --> 59:27.853
Fine, I'll show you.

59:27.931 --> 59:30.422
- What are you doing?
- I'll show you!

59:32.035 --> 59:33.525
Are you crazy?

59:35.838 --> 59:37.999
- Have you gone completely mad?
- Just wait, you'll see.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.939
- See what?
- You'll see.

59:40.577 --> 59:43.569
See what, Ben?
What am I supposed to see?

59:51.588 --> 59:53.351
It's not happening.

59:54.390 --> 59:56.187
It's not happening.

59:56.392 --> 59:59.190
Amy, I swear to you, at the Mayflower...

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.130
I am not lying.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:23.043
Ben. Let's go back inside, okay?

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.420
Put the gun away.

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:33.962
Listen to me, baby. I want to help you.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.057
Tell the kids I'm sorry.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.360
Ben!

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:10.523
No!

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.885
Jesus Christ.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.074
Larry, it's me. I need your help again.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:58.712
I'm trying to locate the patient-employee
manifest for St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.050
<i>Where is it?</i>

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.317
Where was it? They closed it down.

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:04.586
But it was in New York.
It's where the Mayflower used to be.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.753
<i>The Mayflower? The department store?</i>

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:09.127
Do you have any idea where
they would store records for a hospital

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:11.393
that's been closed for over 50 years?

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.935
<i>No, I don't. But I can send someone</i>
<i>to city hall to check it out.</i>

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:17.939
<i>If it's a public hospital, there'd be a record</i>
<i>of it. Tell me exactly what you need.</i>

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:21.636
Same thing. I'm looking for a patient
or an employee with the name Esseker.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:26.307
<i>All right, I'm on it. Give me a couple hours,</i>
<i>and, Ben, keep your head down.</i>

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:50.229
Hey.

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.774
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.602
It's Anna Esseker.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.544
I didn't really know what you wanted,
so I got all the medical files.

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:03.676
This is perfect, Larry. This is perfect.

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:06.620
What happened?
Did you get in an accident?

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.884
Anna Esseker's file,
did you have to go to city hall for it?

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.357
No, I didn't have to go anywhere.

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:13.395
All the files in that place were in storage
with the cold-case evidence.

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.622
Why, because of the fire?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:18.360
No, it's before the fire.
It's a totally different case.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.696
Anna was a patient at St. Matthew's.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.398
She was in the psych ward
run by a Dr. Kane.

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:26.600
Now get this,
she was only 12 years old when she died.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:27.664
What?

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:31.702
When the nurses went on their rounds
first thing in the morning, October 6, 1952,

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.773
they discovered that all the patients
had left their rooms during the night,

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:36.841
and they'd all gathered in the main hall.

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.513
Ben, they were all dead, including the girl.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:43.080
Apparently, they killed each other.
I mean, it was a slaughterhouse.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.525
That's when they closed the place down.
Who knows what really happened?

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.960
- What about the doctor? Kane?
- Well, they arrested him.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.895
They found him dead
first day of the hearing.

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:53.423
He slashed his wrists
with a piece of the cell mirror.

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:57.365
- Thanks for your help.
- Good luck.

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:04.840
Damn it!

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.014
Jesus.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:00.895
"October 6, 1952."

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:08.901
"Anna Esseker is diagnosed with
severe schizophrenia,

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:13.278
"leading to withdrawal from reality,
delusional and violent behavior."

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:26.754
"Pennsylvania, August 1951."

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.948
They don't match.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:53.314
Anna Esseker was discharged
from St. Matthew's Hospital October 4.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.550
Two days before the massacre.

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:20.043
She's alive, isn't she?

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.997
You almost done, sweetie? Okay.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:42.504
Why is Daddy acting so scared?
It's not normal.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.871
He's way older than me.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:51.004
And I'm not acting scared, but he is.

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:56.911
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Michael? What are you doing?

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.181
Nothing.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.685
- Okay, well, we gotta get going, all right?
- Okay.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.283
- Amy? Amy, what's wrong?
<i>- Ben.</i>

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:42.194
You have to come
to the house right now.

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:43.856
I'm so scared.

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.833
<i>- Amy, what's wrong?</i>
- I'm so scared.

01:11:46.902 --> 01:11:50.133
- Amy, just tell me what happened.
<i>- There's something in the house.</i>

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:54.335
- Something in the mirrors.
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.467
God damn it!

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:04.146
Come on.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:13:00.502
- Dad? When are you coming back home?
- Really soon, sweetheart. Come here.

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:06.508
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.140
I gotta go.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.447
I'm afraid to stay here.

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:12.487
There's gonna be windows and mirrors
wherever you go.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.988
Anything that causes a reflection
right now is dangerous.

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:17.082
At least inside the house
we've covered everything.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.320
It's the safest place to be.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.355
Amy, I'm so sorry.

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:24.955
No. It's not your fault.
I should've believed you.

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.033
Come here.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:35.000
Ben, you do whatever it takes to end this.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:38.612
- You hear me?
- I will.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.413
I'll be right back.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.624
Jesus.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.194
Yes, sir?

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:46.764
Excuse me. Is this the Esseker farm?

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:49.538
- What is it, Jimmy?
- I don't know, Ma.

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:54.276
- What can I do for you, sir?
- I'm looking for Anna. Anna Esseker.

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:57.611
There's a man looking for...
You said Anna?

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.313
Yes, Anna Esseker.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.322
An Anna Esseker, Ma.

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:06.925
Look, I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong place.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.761
What is it you want with Anna Esseker?

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:20.506
I'm doing a research paper
on schizophrenia.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.170
I became familiar with
Anna Esseker's case.

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.577
I just wanted to ask her some questions.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:30.781
Go tell Grandpa there's a man here
who's asking about his sister.

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.046
Okay.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:34.155
Thank you.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.519
Grandpa?

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:39.354
You know, up to this day,

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.829
visions of Anna's fits
still haunt me at night.

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:49.202
I helped my father fix up this part
of the basement especially for her.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.308
Her fits were too violent.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:56.276
<i>My mother couldn't</i>
<i>take her screams anymore.</i>

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:09.947
We had every priest, doctor, healer,
coming in from all over the county,

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.993
but no one could help her.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:32.378
So finally, a Dr. Kane from New York
answered my parents' cries for help.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:38.519
He rejected the idea of demonic
possession, said he didn't believe in it.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:43.217
He was convinced Anna suffered from
a rare form of personality disorder

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:46.759
and mirrors could help her.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:51.155
He wanted Anna under his care,
at St. Matthew's.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.327
My parents were very poor,

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:57.804
but he agreed to cover all the costs
of the hospital.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.433
Where did she go after the hospital?

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:01.908
Don't you know?

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.605
She died there
with all of Kane's other patients.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.114
Mr. Esseker, I read the file.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.912
Anna left the hospital
two days before the massacre.

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:13.477
Dr. Kane altered the documents
so she could disappear.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.148
Where did you get that document?

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:20.683
I need you to tell me where she went
after St. Matthew's.

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.762
She came back
and stayed with us for a while.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:28.098
What do you mean for a while?
What happened? Why did she leave?

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.934
- I don't want to talk about that.
- Why did she leave?

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.171
Because strange things
started to happen in the house.

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:36.267
With Anna?

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.802
No, no, not with Anna anymore.
No, she was totally cured.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:45.377
Strange things started to happen
with the mirrors, didn't they?

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:48.753
Mr. Esseker, I need to know where Anna
is now. It's a matter of life and death.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.156
Do not make me threaten you.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:56.220
We sent her somewhere
where mirrors are forbidden.

01:18:57.299 --> 01:19:01.167
- Where the mirrors couldn't find her.
- Where? Where?

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:05.704
St. Augustine's Monastery,
on the road to Reedfield.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.998
How can I help you?

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.963
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sister,

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:17.307
but I've come to speak with a member
of your community. Anna Esseker.

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.771
Is she expecting you?

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.345
No, not really.

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:24.283
If you're not listed, I cannot help you, sir.

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:28.448
Can you at least tell her
that I've come from New York

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:30.548
to speak with her?

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.890
I work with Dr. Kane
from St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.958
It's very important, please.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:47.103
St. Matthew's closed down in 1952.
Who are you?

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.336
My name is Benjamin Carson.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:53.578
I work as a night watchman
on Sixth Avenue in New York City

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:56.947
in the building that used to be
St. Matthew's Hospital.

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.578
What is it you want, Mr. Carson?

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:01.853
My family is in danger,

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:04.551
and what's threatening them
is asking for you.

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:08.824
I came all this way to ask you

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.127
why the mirrors that were left over
from St. Matthew's Hospital

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:13.463
are so desperate to find you.

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:16.498
Please, Miss Esseker.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.901
If you don't help me,

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.306
I'm gonna lose the most important thing
to me in this world,

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.071
and that's my family.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.649
Sit down, Mr. Carson.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:40.695
The mirrors are merely windows
on our world.

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.830
It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.836
but of what is imprisoned inside them.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.997
What is imprisoned inside them?

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:55.901
At the time that I was at St. Matthew's,

01:21:56.912 --> 01:22:00.507
<i>Dr. Kane's therapy</i>
<i>for personality disorders</i>

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:05.451
<i>consisted of locking the patient up</i>
<i>in a mirrored room</i>

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:11.686
<i>for several days on end,</i>
<i>forcing them to confront their own image.</i>

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:17.160
<i>Dr. Kane was wrong about his theory.</i>

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:21.363
<i>There is no cure for schizophrenia,</i>
<i>Mr. Carson.</i>

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.906
It was something else.

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:33.639
<i>And whatever it was,</i>
<i>it left me and entered the mirrors.</i>

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:36.916
Since that day,

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:40.580
it has been collecting
the souls of the people it kills.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.784
I'm sorry,

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:47.191
but if I agree to go with you
and return back to that place,

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:48.991
I will make it possible for the demon

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:51.931
to cross the threshold
back into the real world.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.558
Do you understand
what that means for my family?

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:57.764
You can't do this.
You need to come back with me.

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:01.575
I'm going to pray for you and your family.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:05.204
That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson.
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.476
God bless you.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:14.917
Gary Lewis, Terrence Berry and many
other men have died trying to find you.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:17.185
And because they failed,
their families died, too.

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:19.886
Two days ago my sister was murdered.

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:23.554
My family will be next
if you don't help me.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.364
Please.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:28.664
Please. Wait, wait.

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:33.706
This is my family.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.675
This is my wife Amy

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.508
and my daughter Daisy
and my son Michael.

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.009
They're beautiful.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.509
They're innocent.
They've never hurt anybody.

01:23:46.621 --> 01:23:48.054
Please.

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:49.880
Take the photo.

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:53.122
Just take the photo.

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.660
Look at them.

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.141
I'm sorry.

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:13.113
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:15.178
They're just kids!

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.687
- Hello?
<i>- Amy.</i>

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:57.350
- Ben, where are you?
<i>- At the monastery.</i>

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.657
- Did you find her?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:01.752
Yeah? Did you talk to...

01:25:02.397 --> 01:25:04.524
<i>- Amy?</i>
- Michael?

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:07.600
Michael?

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.997
<i>Ben, hold on, Michael's gone.</i>

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.333
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.806
I fell asleep with the kids on the bed
and now I don't know where he is.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:14.933
<i>Michael?</i>

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.408
Amy, what's going on?
Is everything all right?

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:18.937
Oh, fuck.

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.239
Amy, what's going on?
Have you got Michael?

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:23.912
Oh, my God.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.414
Ben, there's water everywhere.

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:29.445
Oh, my God.

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:33.254
<i>You've got to be careful of the water.</i>
<i>It creates reflections.</i>

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:36.292
Someone is in the house.

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:38.059
Someone scraped all the mirrors!

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.725
Amy, where is Michael?

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.463
I don't know. I don't know where he is.
I don't see him anywhere.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.368
<i>Amy, listen to me,</i>
<i>you've gotta stay away from the water.</i>

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:47.169
<i>Get the kids</i>
<i>and stay away from the water!</i>

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.735
- Michael?
<i>- Amy?</i>

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.109
Amy? Shit!

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.689
Which room is she in? Which one?

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:10.625
My family is not dying tonight.
You are coming with me.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.674
Michael?

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.628
Daisy?

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:51.365
Daisy, come here.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.944
Come here, Daisy.

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.347
Mom?

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:17.330
Come here, sweetheart.

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.918
What are you doing in there?

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:43.187
Everything's going to be all right.

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:58.963
No!

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:04.777
No! No!

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.006
Daisy!

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.142
Come here! Get down!
Get down, right now!

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:14.154
Get down, sweetie. Get down.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:17.714
Oh, my God! Stay right there.
Don't move, baby! Don't move!

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:20.226
- Mom, why did you do that to me?
- It wasn't me, sweetheart.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:22.229
You know I would never hurt you.
You know that.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:24.629
Here. Hold this. Hold it tight.

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.091
Okay?

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:33.338
Here, get down, sweetie.
Let me see. Let me see.

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.473
Let me see, sweetie. It's gonna be okay.

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:40.605
All right? I know it hurts. Stay right there.

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:46.120
All right. Give me your hand.
I need you to hold it really tight, okay?

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.712
Just flat and tight, just like that. Okay.

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:52.089
Now, I need you to listen to me,
okay, baby?

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.060
- You have to be very brave.
- Okay.

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.925
I need you to stay here
no matter what happens.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:59.558
No matter what you hear. Do not move
from this closet until I come back.

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.101
- You understand me, right?
- Yes.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.967
Okay. Okay.

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:06.165
Do not move. I love you.

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:08.734
Don't move.

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:37.835
Michael?

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.887
Michael?

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.392
Where are you?

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.093
Michael?

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:24.279
Michael!

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:27.080
Michael, what are you doing?

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:35.423
Don't be scared, Mommy.
He just wants to play with us.

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:39.163
Michael, I want you to drop that knife,
right now.

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.757
Do you hear me?

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:46.068
You know very well you're not allowed
to play with knives. Don't you?

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:49.370
Come on.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.709
That's a good boy.

01:30:55.082 --> 01:30:57.175
Give me the knife, Michael.

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.753
Michael! Michael!

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:04.223
Michael?

01:31:12.266 --> 01:31:13.528
Michael!

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:16.033
Michael!

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.173
Michael?

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.301
Michael.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.011
Michael?

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:30.511
Why are you hiding from me, sweetheart?

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:43.653
Michael?

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:39.018
You okay? Come on.

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:28.501
It's waiting for me downstairs.

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:42.078
Bring me inside. From now on,
I have to keep my eyes closed.

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.681
Step up. You're in the room.

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.915
Strap me in.

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:59.627
I spent the darkest days of my life
in this room.

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:04.193
Are you sure there's no other way?

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:06.865
This is for your family, Mr. Carson.

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:09.903
For your family.

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.390
Michael?

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.867
Michael? Michael, look at me.

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:17.172
Michael! No, Michael!

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:21.637
No! Give him back to me! Give him back!

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:24.941
No!

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.684
No! Get out!

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:30.724
Come on, Michael!

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.156
No!

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:33.887
Please. Please.

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:37.695
You must go now.

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.198
Thank you.

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:41.431
No!

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:46.970
Why?

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.669
Give him back, please!

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:27.680
Give him back! Give him back!

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:29.776
Michael!

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:35.121
No! No!

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.536
Michael?

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:02.445
Oh, my baby!

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.440
Come on.

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:34.109
One, two, three...

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:43.216
...five, six...

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.793
Thank God!

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.201
Thank you. I love you!

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:09.374
Anna?

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:39.209
Anna?

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:23.181
Come out, you bitch!

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:36.576
Oh, my God.

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:40.281
Oh, my baby.

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.385
I love you both.

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:56.162
I love you, guys.
