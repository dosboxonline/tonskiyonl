00:28.653 --> 00:30.447
I have a plan! I have a plan!

00:30.530 --> 00:33.825
Cease your yammering and relieve us
from this irksome confinement.

00:33.908 --> 00:37.328
Yeah, I'll have to agree with
the walking thesaurus on that one.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.748
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.666
It's just a metaphor, dude.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.794
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.421
Nothing goes over my head.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.674
My reflexes are too fast.
I would catch it.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.474
You're Drax.
The Destroyer.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.520
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

01:03.354 --> 01:04.898
and my daughter, Kamaria.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.945
He killed my family.
I shall kill one of his in return.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.614
Ah!

01:12.697 --> 01:14.282
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:14.365 --> 01:16.242
If killing Ronan is truly
your sole purpose,

01:16.326 --> 01:18.536
I don't think this is
the best way to go about it.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.877
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

01:33.343 --> 01:35.053
Spare me your foul gaze, woman!

01:35.887 --> 01:36.888
Why is this one here?

01:37.514 --> 01:40.642
We promised him he could stay
by your side until he kills your boss.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.478
What's this crap?

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
This is the history of my life.

01:45.772 --> 01:50.777
At last!
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.195
You called Ronan?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.426
I don't recall killing your family.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.433
I doubt
I'll remember killing you, either.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.938
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.191
I am Groot.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.610
Save them? How?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.963
Finger to the throat means death.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.217
Metaphor.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.594
Yeah, sorta.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.856
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.859
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.822
Showtime, A-holes!

03:18.531 --> 03:21.117
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.411
I must cut through it from the inside.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.413
Huh? No!

03:39.802 --> 03:43.431
Yes! I have single-handedly...
vanquished the beast!

03:48.686 --> 03:49.938
Die, spaceship!

03:50.813 --> 03:52.899
Someone destroyed all our ships!

04:00.031 --> 04:03.201
Those pools remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter

04:03.284 --> 04:05.536
to the Forgotten Lakes of my homeworld.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.039
She was like you.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.958
Disgusting?

04:11.042 --> 04:12.168
Innocent.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.342
All any of you do is yell at each other.
You are not friends.

04:19.425 --> 04:23.096
You're right. We're family.
We leave no one behind.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.268
Except maybe you.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.644
Oh, my God.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.275
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

04:36.025 --> 04:39.445
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.407
This... This is a man.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.868
A handsome, muscular man.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.203
I'm muscular.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.290
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.919
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.673
To bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life.

04:59.757 --> 05:03.886
He used to kill people
planet by planet, massacre by massacre.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.471
Including my own.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.476
Today he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.648
Thanos!

05:37.003 --> 05:41.174
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

05:41.799 --> 05:45.303
It is pleasing to once again
have friends.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.899
Dude. How long have you been
standing there?

05:57.982 --> 05:58.983
An hour.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.651
An hour?

06:01.402 --> 06:02.487
Are you serious?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.989
I have mastered the ability

06:05.073 --> 06:08.117
of standing so incredibly still...

06:08.951 --> 06:11.120
that I become invisible to the eye.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.414
Watch.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.503
You're eating a zarg-nut.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.799
But my movement... was so slow...
