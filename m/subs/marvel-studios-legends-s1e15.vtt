(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:27.569 --> 00:29.654
CHRISTINE: <i>You should be</i>
<i>my neurosurgeon on call.</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:31.114
You could make such a difference.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.949
-I can't work in your butcher shop.
-Hey.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.826
Look, I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.454
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.748
My work is gonna save thousands
for years to come.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.417
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.711
Yeah, you're right.
In ER, we're only saving lives.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.756
There's no fame,
there's no CNN interviews.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.889
CHRISTINE: <i>I have a very strict rule</i>
<i>against dating colleagues.</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:58.308
-DR. STRANGE: <i>Really?</i>
<i>-I call it the "Strange Policy."</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:01.311
DR. STRANGE: <i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>I'm glad something's named after me.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:04.355
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.316
Come with me.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.359
Another speaking engagement?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.611
So romantic.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.699
DR. STRANGE: <i>You used to love</i>
<i>coming to those things with me.</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:17.410
<i>-We had fun together.</i>
-CHRISTINE: (LAUGHS)<i> No! You had fun.</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:19.662
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.999
DR. STRANGE: <i>Not only about me.</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:25.335
CHRISTINE: <i>Stephen.</i>
<i>Everything is about you.</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:32.592
DR. STRANGE: <i>Billy.</i>

01:32.675 --> 01:34.427
<i>-What have you got for me?</i>
-(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:34.511 --> 01:36.304
BILLY: <i>I've got a 35-year-old</i>
<i>Air Force Colonel...</i>

01:36.387 --> 01:37.806
<i>Mid-thoracic burst fracture.</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:39.099
Yeah, well, I could help...

01:39.182 --> 01:40.558
but so could 50 other people.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.018
Find me something worth my time.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.269
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:45.730 --> 01:46.731
WOMAN: <i>Here we go.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:48.399
One twenty...

01:50.777 --> 01:51.903
It's gonna be okay.

01:52.904 --> 01:53.905
(PANTING)

01:54.447 --> 01:55.990
What did they do?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.159
No one could have done better.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.870
I could've done better.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.414
CHRISTINE: <i>Some things</i>
<i>just can't be fixed.</i>

02:03.498 --> 02:06.668
DR. STRANGE: <i>Life without my work...</i>
CHRISTINE: <i>Is still life.</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.002
<i>This isn't the end.</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.713
There are other things
that can give your life meaning.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.382
Like what? Like you?

02:16.010 --> 02:17.387
<i>All I need is possible.</i>

02:17.637 --> 02:18.638
(GRUNTING)

02:18.805 --> 02:19.931
(GROANS)

02:20.932 --> 02:23.143
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.148
BARON: <i>Forget everything</i>
<i>you think you know.</i>

02:28.231 --> 02:29.232
Right.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.110
ANCIENT ONE: <i>What if I told you</i>
<i>that your own body could be convinced</i>

02:32.193 --> 02:35.363
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

02:37.490 --> 02:38.741
DR. STRANGE: <i>Teach me.</i>

02:40.118 --> 02:42.579
-(ALL GRUNTING)
-ANCIENT ONE: <i>We harness energy</i>

02:43.413 --> 02:46.833
<i>drawn from other dimensions to make magic.</i>

02:50.086 --> 02:52.338
<i>The language of the mystic arts...</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:54.132
<i>is as old as civilization.</i>

02:57.927 --> 03:00.513
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.931
<i>He feeds off it.</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:07.562
<i>You defended the New York Sanctum</i>
<i>from attack.</i>

03:07.645 --> 03:09.606
With its master gone, it needs another.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.692
Christine!

03:15.361 --> 03:17.447
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.366
For all of it. You were right.

03:20.450 --> 03:24.204
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.705
CHRISTINE: <i>What the hell is happening?</i>

03:25.788 --> 03:27.540
KAECILIUS: <i>The world is not</i>
<i>what it ought to be.</i>

03:27.624 --> 03:29.083
Humanity longs for the eternal...

03:29.334 --> 03:30.877
(GRUNTS)

03:30.960 --> 03:33.046
DR. STRANGE: <i>You think</i>
<i>this is where you die.</i>

03:33.129 --> 03:34.339
WOMAN: Her pupils have dilated!

03:34.422 --> 03:36.507
ANCIENT ONE: <i>Death</i>
<i>is what gives life meaning.</i>

03:37.133 --> 03:39.010
To know your days are numbered.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.012
DR. STRANGE: <i>I'm not ready.</i>

03:41.638 --> 03:43.014
It's not about you.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.309
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.602
That it could be a beginning.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.938
CHRISTINE: <i>There are other ways</i>
<i>to save lives.</i>

03:54.859 --> 03:57.278
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.909
This is time.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.993
Dormammu...

04:04.202 --> 04:05.954
Dormammu... Dormammu...

04:06.037 --> 04:07.830
Dormammu... Dormammu...

04:07.914 --> 04:09.249
Set me free!

04:09.916 --> 04:11.751
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.003
<i>And I'll break the loop.</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:15.546
(SCREAMING)

04:17.006 --> 04:18.967
WONG: <i>You might have a gift</i>
<i>for the mystic arts,</i>

04:19.050 --> 04:21.177
<i>but you still have much to learn.</i>

04:22.512 --> 04:24.847
Word of The Ancient One's death
will spread.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.725
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.352
We must be ready.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.436
We'll be ready.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.275
BANNER: <i>Thanos is coming.</i>

04:35.942 --> 04:36.943
He's coming.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.697
BANNER: <i>If he gets his hands</i>
<i>on all six stones...</i>

04:40.780 --> 04:43.908
He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.206
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

04:50.290 --> 04:53.042
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

04:53.251 --> 04:56.963
EBONY MAW: <i>You are about to die</i>
<i>at the hands of the Children of Thanos.</i>

04:57.046 --> 04:59.299
You're trespassing in this city
and on this planet.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.466
(ROARS)

05:02.552 --> 05:05.596
Dr. Banner, if the rest of
your green friend won't be joining us...

05:05.680 --> 05:06.681
(EXCLAIMS)

05:06.806 --> 05:08.433
<i>Gotta get that stone outta here, now.</i>

05:08.516 --> 05:09.642
It stays with me.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.062
(GRUNTS)

05:13.730 --> 05:14.731
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

05:14.814 --> 05:16.691
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.776
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.237
Give me the stone.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.658
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.368
(SHRIEKS)

05:27.452 --> 05:30.121
STARK: <i>You saw what they did,</i>
<i>what they can do.</i>

05:30.204 --> 05:31.914
<i>So I say we take the fight to him.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:34.500
DR. STRANGE: <i>We go to him.</i>
<i>But you have to understand...</i>

05:34.709 --> 05:37.378
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.799
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.136
Nice. Good, moral compass.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.560
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.145
How many did you see?

05:54.228 --> 05:56.022
14,000,605.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.148
(CHANTING)

05:57.273 --> 05:58.649
STARK: <i>How many did we win?</i>

05:59.233 --> 06:00.234
One.

06:00.943 --> 06:01.944
(GRUNTS)

06:08.493 --> 06:09.702
(STRAINING)

06:10.203 --> 06:12.997
Our oath to protect the Time Stone
cannot change.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.583
<i>This stone may be the best chance</i>
<i>we have against Thanos.</i>

06:15.666 --> 06:18.711
Yeah, so conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.805
DR. STRANGE: Spare his life...

06:29.972 --> 06:31.724
and I will give you the stone.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.356
Why would you do that?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.817
There was no other way.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.346
STARK: <i>You said one out of 14 million,</i>
<i>we win, yeah?</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:12.765
Tell me this is it.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.309
DR. STRANGE: <i>If I tell you what happens,</i>

07:15.393 --> 07:16.436
<i>it won't happen.</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:21.023
You better be right.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.442
