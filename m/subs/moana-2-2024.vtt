[Moana] Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Listen to me!

37:45.041 --> 37:47.458
We are on a sacred voyage!

37:47.625 --> 37:48.958
You will release us.

Wait. Wait!

- Ow, ow, ow!

38:04.416 --> 38:06.375
Whoa. What are you doing?

38:10.958 --> 38:12.041
[grunts]

38:12.208 --> 38:14.041
[slurring] What is happening?

38:24.625 --> 38:26.416
Uh... That is...

38:26.583 --> 38:27.583
[clears throat]

38:27.750 --> 38:28.791
Fanfic.

38:28.958 --> 38:32.083
You dolt. They're asking
if you drew it,

38:32.250 --> 38:35.791
'cause they want you
to translate that picture.

38:36.166 --> 38:37.166
Oh!

38:38.916 --> 38:39.958
Oh.

38:40.708 --> 38:43.791
Oh. Your home island

38:46.083 --> 38:48.541
is in the same sea
as Motufetū.

38:50.041 --> 38:52.250
And when Nalo
divided the ocean

38:52.416 --> 38:54.458
to weaken the people
of the sea,

38:55.083 --> 38:58.916
your ancestors were
disconnected from their home.

39:00.458 --> 39:03.583
But you thought you'd finally
found the way back

39:03.750 --> 39:05.625
when you ran
into this giant clam.

39:06.958 --> 39:12.041
And now, you're worried
you'll stay separated forever.

39:14.125 --> 39:15.416
This whole time,

39:16.125 --> 39:19.041
they've just been trying
to get home.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.208
[♪ somber music playing]

39:21.500 --> 39:25.791
But if we help you
defeat the clam,

39:26.166 --> 39:28.041
you'll help us reach Motufetū.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.583
Together.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.791
Hello? We're still jelly!

39:34.958 --> 39:36.875
How're we gonna beat that?

39:37.041 --> 39:39.791
Floppy can't even
wiggle a finger.

39:39.958 --> 39:42.708
Well, our muscles
are full of neurotoxin, so...

39:42.875 --> 39:44.666
Wait. Wait. Hang on.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.875
A clam is basically
one giant muscle.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.583
So, we get close enough
with that stuff,

39:48.750 --> 39:49.750
shoot it in the ganglion,

39:49.916 --> 39:52.583
it's goodnight clam,
hello Motufetū.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.625

Do you think that'll work?

39:56.250 --> 39:57.333

40:00.666 --> 40:03.333
Oh. You want us to do it.

40:03.500 --> 40:04.500
[groans]

40:04.666 --> 40:07.125
It'd be easier
if we're not jelly.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.166
Ooh. Don't worry.
They can fix that.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.666

40:40.458 --> 40:42.458
It just went right over
the top of us, didn't it?

40:42.625 --> 40:45.541
Okay, where do we get
the toxin for the clam?

40:52.916 --> 40:53.958

41:13.958 --> 41:15.375
[grunts softly] What?

41:16.291 --> 41:19.333
[grunting] We made a deal.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.500
We take out the clam,

41:20.666 --> 41:24.166
and then you're helping us
get to Motufetū.

it's a warriors' salute,

to show us respect.

41:43.875 --> 41:45.083
[clacking in unison]

the ganglion

42:02.208 --> 42:03.958
if we don't know
what it looks like?

42:04.125 --> 42:05.875
[Loto] I think
we're gonna know

42:06.041 --> 42:08.125
what a ganglion looks like
when we see it.

42:11.375 --> 42:12.375
[Loto] Yeah.

So, I just...

[distant thunder rumbles]

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.791
Nalo wants to end our story.

01:07:28.375 --> 01:07:30.250
But we're not
letting that happen.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:31.875
We just have to outsmart him,

01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:34.500
find some new tricks
he's never seen before.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:38.208
Well, I have been
working on some ideas.

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:40.583
Also, we do have a demigod.

01:07:41.041 --> 01:07:42.625
Sure, he's a little scruffy,

01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:44.375
but, you know,
better than nothing.

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:45.791
I think you look great.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:49.416
Okay. We sail to the heart
of Nalo's storm.

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:54.041
Once I raise the island,
you all have to get to it.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:07:58.166
It'll be harder than anything
we've faced before.

01:07:58.333 --> 01:07:59.458
So, if anyone wants to...

01:08:03.375 --> 01:08:08.541
I spent my whole life
learning our people's stories.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.083
Because of you,
I get to live one.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:16.916
All right, then.

01:08:18.083 --> 01:08:19.458
Let's break a curse.

01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:24.291
[Maui] Yeah.

01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:25.875
[exhales] Been a while

01:08:26.041 --> 01:08:27.791

an island from the sea.

01:08:29.208 --> 01:08:30.625
I know I have to bend
at the knees.

01:08:31.458 --> 01:08:32.666
I have great posture.

01:08:32.833 --> 01:08:34.541

01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:44.041
[chuckles] That's beautiful.

01:08:44.208 --> 01:08:45.541
[Moana] Okay, we do this,

01:08:46.125 --> 01:08:47.208

[Moni] Um, that's a big wave.

01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:31.791
We can go around it.

01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:33.333
Everyone,

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.250
Be ready to switch it up.

You, smart-stuff,

01:09:38.208 --> 01:09:39.750
you might wanna
