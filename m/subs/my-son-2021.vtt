[alarm continues]

01:49.859 --> 01:52.445
[automated female voice]
Please cross
the bridge and turn left,

01:52.487 --> 01:55.573
and continue to follow
the road for 42 miles.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.236
Please turn right
and continue for six miles.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.816
Please turn right.
You have reached
your destination.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.703
All right. How you doing?
I’m Edmond Murray.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.789
Hi. Can I see your ID, please?

03:25.830 --> 03:26.915
Of course.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.586
[police radio chatter]

03:33.088 --> 03:34.297
Here you go.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.926
Mr. Murray’s just arrived.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.719
[officer] Copy that.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.763
Good morning.
My name’s Officer Birch.
How you doing?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.807
I’m the initial
investigating officer.
Uh-huh.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.684
Ms. Richmond is waiting for you
over by the water.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.395
I’m Ethan’s dad.
I know that, Mr. Murray.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.772
I’m afraid that
I cannot comment any
further on the case.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.732
Inspector Roy will be
down here later on.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.442
He’ll be able
to fill you in
on any questions.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.236
Okay.
Ms. Richmond is
just down by the water,

03:56.277 --> 03:59.280
if you follow the path
over to the right.
Okay. Thank you.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.907
[exhales]

04:16.673 --> 04:17.882
Joan!

04:21.219 --> 04:23.471
Fuck. Joan!

04:36.151 --> 04:38.069
[Joan sobbing]

04:43.199 --> 04:44.826
What are they
doing out there?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.454
They’re looking for him.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.873
They think
he’s in the water?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.417
I don’t know.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.002
[sobbing]

04:56.463 --> 04:57.839
I don’t know.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.890
What the fuck happened?

05:06.931 --> 05:08.767
I don’t know.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.355
[police radio chatter]

05:14.647 --> 05:16.524
That’s where
he was sleeping.

05:27.869 --> 05:31.373
You all right?
I can’t go back there.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.972
Can I go in there?
No, sorry.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.140
Fuck.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.402
I’ve rented this place.
I’m going to stay here.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.529
Okay, I’ll stay
somewhere near.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.490
Good.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.958
Would you be able
to do something for me?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.460
Mm-hmm.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.130
I need you to go back
to the house.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.469
Ethan drew me a picture

07:07.510 --> 07:09.804
the day before he left and...

07:12.432 --> 07:14.142
I can’t stop
thinking about it.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.775
Thanks.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.902
Do we know anything
about the people
that run that camp?

07:23.943 --> 07:26.821
No, they said
they’ve questioned everyone.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.949
Did you meet them?
Before you sent him?

07:31.910 --> 07:35.372
Yeah, I mean...
They seemed really lovely.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.124
The woman was really lovely.
I don’t...
Uh-huh.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.419
I...
I’m sure they were fine.
I’m sure they were fine.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.674
I never would have sent him
there if I thought that
there was anything wrong. Ever!

07:45.715 --> 07:48.968
I know, I know.
You’re a good mum.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.136
I know.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.222
[phone ringing]

07:56.017 --> 07:57.060
Hi.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.854
Are you okay?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.148
-[man] Yeah.
-Yeah?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.609
-It was fine.
-What did they want to know?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.820
Well, they just had
some questions.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.613
What sort of stuff?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.949
My relationship with Ethan.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.033
Why?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.832
No. Are you on your way back?
Can you come back?

08:19.374 --> 08:20.750
Okay, all right.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.877
-Bye. I love you.
-Love you. Bye.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.839
Is that your man?
Yeah.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.049
Was it his idea
to send him to the camp?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.884
Oh, fucking hell.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.638
Yeah, sure,
it was his idea.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.768
He’s my son. Okay?

08:38.810 --> 08:41.980
It was my choice.
I wish he hadn’t gone.

08:42.022 --> 08:46.067
So do I.
I didn’t want him to go
in the first place, but...

08:47.235 --> 08:49.696
kids his age,
they’re doing stuff like that.

08:49.738 --> 08:53.783
And Ethan’s not... He’s...

08:54.909 --> 08:58.038
He’s different, and he...

08:59.998 --> 09:01.750
he didn’t want to go.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.170
And I knew
he didn’t want to go.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.050
He seemed okay,
before he went?

09:10.091 --> 09:14.262
I just...
I just needed a...

09:17.265 --> 09:18.308
I’m sorry.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.060
[sniffles]

09:20.101 --> 09:21.519
Was it...

09:21.561 --> 09:23.605
He’s been having
a hard time.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.024
Okay?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.908
[dog barking]

09:46.336 --> 09:47.712
[man] All right?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.924
Get them ready to go.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.176
Inspector, this is Eddy,
Ethan’s dad.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.929
All right, Mr. Murray.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.056
I’m Inspector Roy.
Inspector.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.600
I’m running
the investigation
with my team here.

10:01.976 --> 10:06.147
Mr. Murray, I’d like you
to come into my office
this afternoon at 3:00, please.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.107
Of course, 3:00.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.150
The details
are on the card.

10:09.192 --> 10:13.238
And my personal mobile number
is on the back,
should you need it.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.118
Miss, are you sure
you want to take part in this?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.202
Yeah.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.164
Yesterday, you seemed--
No.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.001
You sure? I’m here.
I can take over.
No, I want to do it.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.294
Very good.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.046
If you’ll just listen
to the instructions

10:30.088 --> 10:32.465
and then I’ll tell you
where to stand.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.009
Okay. Thank you.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.844
[Roy]
Attention, please, everyone!

10:37.178 --> 10:40.015
This morning,
we’re going to search
this entire slope.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.934
I want you to move
through the bracken together.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.686
You keep two meters apart.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.187
If you find anything,

10:46.229 --> 10:49.024
you raise your hand
and you shout, "Here!"

10:49.065 --> 10:52.777
It’s very important
that you touch nothing.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.112
Understood?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.321
All right.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.201
Thank you all for coming.
Take your positions, please.

11:00.243 --> 11:03.496
Where do you want us?
You can stand here,
at the end of this line.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.914
[Edmond] Thank you.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.666
Two meters, two meters.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.127
[dogs barking]

11:16.176 --> 11:19.304
Kennis!
Let’s go!

11:23.391 --> 11:25.685
[all] Ethan! Ethan!

11:25.727 --> 11:28.355
-Ethan!
-[dogs barking]

11:30.273 --> 11:33.193
Ethan! Ethan!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.279
Ethan! Ethan!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.499
Ethan!

11:54.172 --> 11:55.507
Ethan!

11:57.842 --> 11:59.094
Ethan!

12:22.867 --> 12:24.494
[Joan] Ethan!

12:35.338 --> 12:37.090
[door opens]

12:38.800 --> 12:41.052
[police radio chatter]

12:46.808 --> 12:49.102
Who’s she?
[officer] Inspector Roy
can tell you.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.562
Please, come with me.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.693
[Edmond]
How you doing?
Mr. Murray. Please.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.487
Is there any news?
Nothing, as yet.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.282
How are you coping?

13:06.161 --> 13:09.122
I’ve--
I’ve known better days,
you know?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.586
Allow me to tell you
where we are.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.130
The alert plan
has been triggered

13:17.172 --> 13:19.466
since
yesterday morning.
Good.

13:19.507 --> 13:24.179
We continue to interview
everybody who has come
into contact with your son.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.140
Now, the supervising
staff at the camp,

13:27.182 --> 13:31.686
they tell me that they would do
regular checks of the tents
and the pods,

13:31.728 --> 13:35.690
to make sure that the children
were asleep and all was well.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.985
The last check took place
at 1:00 in the morning.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.528
And he was in there?

13:40.570 --> 13:43.990
He was in there.
At that point,
everything was fine.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.870
When I looked at his cabin,

13:48.912 --> 13:52.374
I could see his clothes
were still in there,
his bag was still in there.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.417
His little snacks
were still in there.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.795
Now, Mr. Murray,

13:56.836 --> 14:00.048
I have to tell you
that we’re investigating
every hypothesis,

14:00.090 --> 14:02.175
including kidnapping.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.013
Now, allow me to ask you
a number of questions.

14:07.055 --> 14:12.185
You may find some of
these questions unsettling,
intimate. May I?

14:12.227 --> 14:14.729
No, don’t worry.
You can ask me
whatever you want.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.525
First of all, I understand
that you’ve been traveling
a great deal.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.654
You’ve been in Libya,
Saudi Arabia, Iraq.
Why is that?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.197
My work’s international.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.199
I’ve been working abroad
for the last ten years,

14:26.241 --> 14:28.076
um, give or take.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.330
I work in the oil fields,
and I go wherever they send me.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.583
Would you say your business,
your work was dangerous?

14:35.625 --> 14:37.419
The work, in itself,
is not dangerous.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.171
You can sometimes
be in places
where you are in danger.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.049
And I am constantly aware,
when I’m in certain places,

14:43.091 --> 14:44.551
that I need to watch my back.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.554
Have any of these things
affected you, Mr. Murray?

14:47.595 --> 14:49.556
Ah... [exhales]

14:49.597 --> 14:52.142
A subordinate of mine
was taken hostage.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.561
We went through a whole fiasco
trying to get him back.

14:54.602 --> 14:59.566
It was a fucking mess.
And we ended up paying
the hostage ransom.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.943
[officer] Sir...

15:03.695 --> 15:06.156
[speaking Gaelic]

15:06.197 --> 15:11.286
Oh, come on.
If you’ve got something to say,
you can say it in English.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.205
I’d like to ask you
for your mobile phone.

15:14.247 --> 15:18.668
We need it for the purposes
of the investigation,
to retrieve the contacts.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.592
It’s procedure.
I’m not supposed
to give my phone out.

15:27.052 --> 15:31.598
I’m sure you can appreciate
the importance of this,
at this point in time.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.224
I completely can.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.729
The nature of my work means
there’s sensitive material
on here.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.608
You just need
my contacts?
Yes.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.238
Thank you.

15:50.533 --> 15:54.371
It would be fair to say
that most of the countries
where you work

15:54.412 --> 15:58.375
would be unsuitable
to take a child to, yes?
Most of them, yes.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.877
The hours that I work,
and the far-flung places
I end up in,

16:00.919 --> 16:04.172
even if they aren’t insecure,
aren’t suitable
for taking a child.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.466
I can’t take him
all over the world.
He’s got to be in school.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.802
He’s got to have his friends,
got to have some stability.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.513
He’s got to have
a house, a family.
And I can’t offer him that.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.308
When did you last see your son?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.530
I saw him at Christmas time.
I saw him...

16:29.739 --> 16:32.325
I saw him on Skype
at Christmas time.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.453
He seemed fine.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.546
[Roy]
Do you have a good relationship
with your ex-wife?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.548
[Edmond] It’s not--
It’s not bad.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.218
It’s not her fault we split up.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.724
[Roy] Is there any antagonism?

17:01.312 --> 17:02.814
[Edmond] From me, none.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.039
[Roy]
Do you have any contact
with her new partner?

17:19.080 --> 17:23.335
[Edmond] I’ve seen him on Skype
a few times. He seems fine.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.588
Have you security checked him?

17:26.629 --> 17:29.049
Because isn’t it well known
that nine times out of ten,

17:29.090 --> 17:33.428
it’s someone you know,
someone in your family?

17:35.096 --> 17:39.559
[Roy] This is the case,
which is why it’s part
of our primary investigation.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.522
And you? Is there someone new
in your life?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.941
[Edmond] Yes.
Yes, I have a partner.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.153
I’ve been seeing her
for five years.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.288
[Roy] Two years ago,
your wife told you that
your son was unwell.

18:00.330 --> 18:05.085
[Edmond] I came back
and we went away together
for a month.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.628
We had a cracking time.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.838
We went all over North America.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.758
And...

18:13.301 --> 18:14.636
[sighs]

18:15.929 --> 18:17.514
And then I went back to work.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.935
Do you have reason to believe

18:21.976 --> 18:24.646
that it’s because of what I do
that Ethan has been taken?

18:27.649 --> 18:33.613
I have reason to believe
that somebody made a decision

18:33.655 --> 18:37.492
to choose your son
and not the other child.

18:40.328 --> 18:45.625
That’s why I’m asking you
these questions,
Mr. Murray. Why Ethan?

18:45.667 --> 18:48.753
Why him? Why not the other boy?

18:49.921 --> 18:53.341
Unfortunately, all you can do
at this point in time is wait.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.677
Wait for us to contact you.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.389
[knocks]

19:45.060 --> 19:47.937
[door unlocking]

19:50.065 --> 19:52.525
How you doing?
[man] Edmond.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.028
Nice to see you.
Come in.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.446
All right. Thank you.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.699
[chattering on TV]

19:59.741 --> 20:02.702
Joan? Where’s Joan?
Ah...

20:02.744 --> 20:05.330
She... She’s resting.
Sit down.
You want a whiskey?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.457
Aye. Sure, thank you.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.710
Brutal weather outside, eh?
[TV turns off]

20:10.752 --> 20:13.630
Uh-huh.
Apparently,
it’s going to be...

20:14.798 --> 20:16.925
It’s going to be
an early winter, apparently.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.970
I mean, that’s what, you know,
the locals are saying.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.681
All the old people.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.518
But no one fucking believes them
anymore, do they?

20:26.559 --> 20:30.522
They just believe the...
the fucking Internet.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.691
Slainte.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.571
Joan’s just...

20:40.532 --> 20:42.409
She really broke down tonight.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.786
You know, I just think it
really fucking...

20:44.828 --> 20:47.080
really hit her.
I know. Fair enough.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.416
So I’ve just given her
a little something
to help her sleep.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.543
So hopefully
she’ll get a full night,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.294
so I’m not gonna--
What did you give her?

20:54.087 --> 20:56.381
Fuck. I don’t know
the name of it. Um...

20:56.423 --> 20:57.841
[clears throat]

20:57.882 --> 21:01.761
I... I struggle
with sleep occasionally

21:01.803 --> 21:04.180
and I got a prescription
fucking ages ago but...

21:04.222 --> 21:06.558
How long has
she been asleep for,
with that?

21:07.142 --> 21:09.019
Um...

21:11.062 --> 21:13.106
About an hour and a half ago,
something like that.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.359
But I don’t think--
I don’t think
I should wake her up, really.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.652
She needs the rest.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.654
Nothing to worry about.
Okay.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.323
Yeah.
It’s not a regular thing.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.577
In the circumstances--
All right, man.
All right. Yep.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.833
So what are you...

21:31.875 --> 21:34.794
What’s going to happen
with your work?
What are you going to do?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.464
Ah, work can wait.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.467
It’s easy for me, really,
’cause I work for myself.
I set up a business.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.635
I’ve got this
construction company and...

21:42.677 --> 21:46.056
I mean, it’s, you know,
small but I’ve had it
for about 15 years.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.474
I started in my early 20s.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.268
Based here?
International?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.687
No. No, I’m not like you. No.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.815
No, I... I want to stay here.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.777
Local, really.
It’s small, you know.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.529
I started it myself.
It was a grind, believe me.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.740
But now I’ve recruited
enough people

22:03.782 --> 22:06.117
that it just kind of
runs itself, which is great.

22:06.159 --> 22:10.622
So I can now
essentially just be here,
be there for Joan and...

22:11.498 --> 22:13.625
Nothing more important
than that, eh?

22:14.876 --> 22:17.003
She’s fucking amazing, man.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.256
Have you heard anything?
Has anybody called or...

22:20.298 --> 22:21.508
Today?
Uh-huh.

22:21.549 --> 22:25.303
What about?
The searches? No, no.

22:25.345 --> 22:29.641
To be honest with you,
my focus is really on her,
you know.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.559
I’m just focusing on her.

22:31.601 --> 22:35.689
No. I’m actually just
going to switch my phone off
for a bit.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.816
Is that a good idea?

22:38.775 --> 22:41.444
Well, you’re here.
You’ve got your phone on, no?

22:41.486 --> 22:43.947
I just wanted
to have a conversation--

22:43.988 --> 22:45.407
Yeah. No, no.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.828
I just don’t
want to be disturbed.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.293
So where are you
going to stay?
Joan said you

22:57.335 --> 22:59.295
don’t really have anywhere
around here anymore.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.758
Don’t worry about me, Frank.
I’ll be fine.
I’ll find something.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.137
Why don’t you stay at Joan’s?
I mean, it’s technically your--
your place, as well.

23:07.178 --> 23:10.015
Aye. Well, if you’re not
going to be there...

23:10.056 --> 23:13.393
Listen, I understand
that you and Joan
might need some space.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.770
No, look, it’s--
Time together.
I can-- I can escape.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.149
My parents-- I inherited
this little shack in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

23:19.190 --> 23:23.611
I can go and, you know,
get out of the way.

23:24.738 --> 23:26.656
I’m selling it, actually.

23:26.698 --> 23:30.493
Because, following
in your footsteps, I found
this unbelievable bit of land,

23:30.535 --> 23:32.495
and now we’re going to
build a house,

23:32.537 --> 23:33.955
and it’s just so beautiful.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.541
Joan loves it.
The light is amazing.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.960
Actually, can I--
can I show you something?

23:39.961 --> 23:43.673
Here, come into the kitchen.
Come on.

23:43.715 --> 23:48.011
So these got delivered
today, actually.
I was just looking over them.

23:48.053 --> 23:51.306
So, I’ve been working
with this architect.
He works in my company.

23:51.348 --> 23:55.268
So he’s designing it with me,
and Joan also.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.562
So this is the outside
of the house.
The sea is here.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.648
And we’ve got
all the light here.
It’s beautiful. Glass here.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.400
Actually, I think
I want a bit more.

24:02.442 --> 24:05.445
But then this is the top floor.
We’ve got our bedroom here.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.573
Lots of light for Joan.
It’s going to be unbelievable.

24:08.615 --> 24:13.620
And then down here
is the basement. Just don’t
really know what to do with it.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.247
Maybe...
Maybe a games room or...

24:16.289 --> 24:19.918
Be careful. What do you think?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.212
Are you actually
fucking kidding me?

24:24.172 --> 24:25.340
Um...

24:25.965 --> 24:27.801
Where’s Ethan’s room?

24:29.094 --> 24:30.261
Okay...

24:31.554 --> 24:33.014
Are you putting him
in the basement?

24:33.056 --> 24:34.808
No, we’re not putting him
in the basement.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.851
I can see that
you’re angry and upset--
Joan!

24:36.893 --> 24:38.520
Hey, hey, hey!
She’s asleep.
No.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.230
She’s asleep.
I need to talk to her.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.481
Hey.
I need to talk to her.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.982
Why? She’s asleep.

24:43.024 --> 24:45.068
’Cause my
fucking son’s missing.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.905
Yeah, I’m aware of that.
I’m aware that
your son’s missing.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.866
He’s also my son.
I love him very much.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.160
Don’t.
Fucking don’t.
Don’t what?

24:54.202 --> 24:56.621
Don’t tell me
he’s your son, as well.
Well, let’s be honest.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.958
He’s been... He’s been
more my son than he has yours
the last year, hasn’t he?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.502
You’re a very fucking weird man!
What have you done with my son?

25:02.544 --> 25:05.213
I’ve done nothing with your son.
What the fuck
have you done with my son?

25:05.255 --> 25:07.549
I love your son!
What the fuck
have you done?

25:16.933 --> 25:21.021
[Edmond] Inspector Roy,
you need to come over here.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.023
I’m at Joan’s
rented accommodation.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.359
I’m here with her partner,
Frank. He’s unconscious.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.403
He’s been high as a kite.
He’s given her drugs.

25:28.445 --> 25:30.488
And he knows something.
He fucking knows something.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.658
Please call me back
at this number
as soon as you can.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.628
-Get the fuck off!
-Get in the van!
Get in the van!

25:45.670 --> 25:49.049
Please, you’re making a mistake!
You’re making a big mistake!

25:49.090 --> 25:51.968
Hey, there’s a picture
in the bag.
Just give it to Joan!

25:52.010 --> 25:54.679
Just get in the van!
You’re making a mistake!

25:55.972 --> 25:57.807
What?
Section 1 of
the Criminal Justice Act...

25:57.849 --> 26:00.268
You don’t understand.
The man has taken my son.

26:00.310 --> 26:03.355
Or he’s done something
to my son, or he fucking knows
something about my son.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.647
You’ve gotta go back there!

26:04.689 --> 26:06.149
You take me to fucking jail,

26:06.191 --> 26:07.776
and you’re taking him
to the hospital?

26:07.817 --> 26:09.444
Do you understand?

26:09.486 --> 26:11.446
You’re having a fucking laugh!

26:11.488 --> 26:15.742
...informed of your arrest
and you’ll have access
to a solicitor.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.660
These rights...
Fuck!

26:17.702 --> 26:20.914
...will be explained to you
further once we arrive
at the police station.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.668
I suggest you make
yourself comfortable,
Mr. Murray.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.878
I don’t care
how fucking badly he is hurt.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.298
The minute he wakes up,
you need to ask him
what he’s done with my son.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.223
You’re not going
to say anything?

26:38.723 --> 26:39.974
Nothing?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.937
My son’s missing!

26:46.314 --> 26:48.817
My son’s missing!

26:54.155 --> 26:55.699
Fuck.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.981
That’s my wallet.

27:29.190 --> 27:32.402
That’s...
They’re actually Joan’s keys.

27:32.444 --> 27:35.238
That’s Frank’s phone.
That’s my phone.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.990
You want to put that
somewhere else?

27:37.032 --> 27:38.908
Put it in there, please.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.952
That could be evidence.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.374
Make yourself at home.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.963
[rain pattering]

28:03.308 --> 28:04.726
All right.

28:11.524 --> 28:15.445
Obviously, you’ll be held
in custody until the morning.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.198
I’ll come back then
and we’ll see
what’s to happen to you.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.866
I’m really sorry
about everything that happened.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.368
But have you spoken to him yet?

28:21.409 --> 28:22.869
I have to impress upon you,
Mr. Murray,

28:22.911 --> 28:25.205
you’re wasting our time now.

28:25.246 --> 28:28.124
Every hour is critical,
and you’re wasting our time.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.085
There’s something
not right about that guy.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.878
The day after my wee boy’s
gone missing,

28:31.920 --> 28:33.630
he’s showing me
blueprints of some house

28:33.672 --> 28:37.175
that he wants to move into
with my wife-- my-- my ex-wife.

28:37.217 --> 28:41.221
And he doesn’t have a room
in that house for my son.

28:41.262 --> 28:45.058
Either he knows something
or he’s criminally
a fucking prick.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.560
Please, Joan’s taking Valium
and going to sleep.

28:47.602 --> 28:49.312
I have known that woman.

28:49.354 --> 28:52.190
She’s a good mother
and she would not take anything

28:52.232 --> 28:54.067
that would stop her
answering that phone.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.319
She would be up checking
that phone every 15 minutes.

28:56.361 --> 28:59.989
So I am really sorry.
I apologize.
I’m not going to talk anymore.

29:00.031 --> 29:04.285
But please,
just treat him seriously.

29:04.327 --> 29:09.332
You’re not stable right now.
I’m telling you straight.

29:09.374 --> 29:13.795
You’re in no position
to tell me how to
conduct this investigation.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.132
I’ll see you.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.634
[pounds on door]

29:19.676 --> 29:21.469
[door opens]

29:21.511 --> 29:23.304
It’s my wee boy...

29:23.346 --> 29:25.098
[door closes]

29:31.604 --> 29:34.274
[Roy] Mr. Gilchrist
is still in hospital.

29:34.315 --> 29:37.944
He has two fractured ribs.
He has a dislocated hip.

29:37.986 --> 29:41.281
Nonetheless, he’s decided not
to press charges against you.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.659
[scoffs]
Were you able to talk to him?

29:44.701 --> 29:47.495
I’ve communicated with him.
I have taken a similar position.

29:47.537 --> 29:50.915
I’m not going to take
this any further, Mr. Murray.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.626
One of my colleagues
has retrieved your car.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.253
It’s at the station here.

29:55.295 --> 29:58.256
You’re letting me go?
You’re no longer in custody.

29:59.966 --> 30:03.261
You don’t think it’s weird
that he’s not
going to press charges?

30:03.303 --> 30:08.308
Mr. Murray,
I’ll explain something
very significant to you,

30:08.350 --> 30:11.144
to help you clear
your mind of all of this.

30:11.186 --> 30:14.856
One month ago, your wife
suffered a miscarriage.

30:16.733 --> 30:19.486
What?
Yes.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.614
I’m telling you this,
so that you can understand
the situation,

30:22.655 --> 30:28.620
the predicament of both
Ms. Richmond
and Frank Gilchrist.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.456
Now,
this was a very difficult thing
for her to deal with.

30:31.498 --> 30:35.877
In fact, this is the reason
that she decided to send
your son to the camp.

30:35.919 --> 30:41.591
So that she could get some calm,
some peace, to deal with this.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.761
It was nothing to do
with Mr. Gilchrist.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.137
Is she all right?

30:46.179 --> 30:49.933
In these circumstances, no.

30:51.267 --> 30:54.479
And I understand that this
is a very difficult period
for you.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.774
I’d like to offer you
psychological support.

30:57.816 --> 30:59.359
You need to go home.

31:00.402 --> 31:02.445
You need to clear your head
of this,

31:02.487 --> 31:05.323
to allow us to go
on with the investigation.

31:06.825 --> 31:08.284
No, I’m fine.

31:08.326 --> 31:10.537
I won’t be any more problem
to you, I promise.

31:10.578 --> 31:13.248
Thank you.
Thank you
for your patience.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.417
[door opens]

31:16.584 --> 31:18.169
[door closes]

31:58.626 --> 32:00.295
[line ringing]

32:01.588 --> 32:04.883
[woman] Hi, this is Leah.
Leave me a message.
Thank you.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.219
[Edmond]
Leah, it’s Edmond. Um...

32:09.929 --> 32:14.225
I’m here.
I’m sorry I’ve not
checked in earlier.

32:14.267 --> 32:16.895
I got in a bit of trouble
with the police last night.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.980
I’m fine. I’m absolutely fine.

32:21.483 --> 32:23.693
And we haven’t heard
anything about...

32:25.362 --> 32:27.614
what’s happened to Ethan yet.

32:30.325 --> 32:33.078
Could you tell the company
I’m really sorry
I haven’t checked in?

32:33.119 --> 32:36.498
Can you do that for me?
Tell them I’m okay
and I’ll be in touch soon.

32:37.582 --> 32:38.708
Um...

32:39.626 --> 32:40.669
I love you.

32:47.217 --> 32:50.178
If you get this call,
just please call me back, okay?

33:19.124 --> 33:22.335
Joan! Joan?

34:06.212 --> 34:07.422
Joan.

34:08.173 --> 34:09.758
[gasps]

34:12.177 --> 34:13.345
You okay?

34:13.386 --> 34:15.055
Have they found him?

34:15.096 --> 34:17.390
No. Not yet.

34:21.895 --> 34:23.271
Joan.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.400
I’m really sorry
for what happened to you.

34:29.694 --> 34:31.112
What do you mean?

34:32.781 --> 34:34.532
About your wee baby.

34:36.284 --> 34:38.995
I’m very sorry.
Who told you that?

34:39.037 --> 34:41.289
Inspector Roy.
He was trying to--

34:41.331 --> 34:45.335
Well, he’s got no fucking right
to tell you that.

34:45.377 --> 34:48.922
I know you guys were going
through a very difficult time,
even before this.

34:48.963 --> 34:50.215
Fuck off.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.553
Was it hard for Ethan?

34:56.304 --> 34:58.139
’Cause he said that you...

34:58.890 --> 34:59.974
I...

35:00.016 --> 35:02.227
You needed peace and...

35:08.191 --> 35:10.318
I mean,
this is bad enough,
as it is.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.654
I don’t know what
you’re trying to do to me.

35:12.696 --> 35:15.365
I’m not trying to do anything.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.575
He didn’t...

35:19.494 --> 35:21.496
He didn’t want me
to have a baby.

35:23.331 --> 35:26.626
Ethan?
No, of course he didn’t.

35:29.421 --> 35:31.506
Does that make you happy?
That he hated it?

35:31.548 --> 35:32.716
No.

35:33.675 --> 35:36.136
’Cause he fucking hated
the idea.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.055
He hated that
Frank had moved in.

35:39.097 --> 35:44.060
And he hated the fact
that you weren’t here anymore.

35:44.102 --> 35:48.189
And the only person he
could talk to about it was me,
because you weren’t here.

35:48.231 --> 35:51.651
So I had to deal with our son
being upset about something

35:51.693 --> 35:53.695
that I was really happy about.

35:56.364 --> 35:58.366
I’m really sorry about that.

36:01.161 --> 36:02.704
Where were you last night?

36:05.457 --> 36:09.044
I was in the police station.
They just let me out.

36:09.085 --> 36:11.755
They said Frank’s not going
to press any charges.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.217
He fucking should.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.678
Did he give you
Valium last night?

36:21.765 --> 36:22.891
Yeah.

36:24.184 --> 36:27.228
I’ve never known you
to take a pill in your life.

36:28.521 --> 36:30.565
Well, you don’t know me anymore.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.110
Okay.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.363
I thought you were
going to say
you were sorry.

36:36.404 --> 36:38.156
That’s what I thought
you were going to say.

36:38.198 --> 36:41.534
I thought you were going to say
sorry for beating the shit

36:41.576 --> 36:43.328
out of my boyfriend.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.580
You know, he never even
mentioned Ethan.

36:45.622 --> 36:48.625
He’s all excited about
his blueprints for his new house
that’s he’s building.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.877
Yeah, we were
really excited about that!

36:50.919 --> 36:53.213
We were really excited
about that.
Ethan was excited about that.

36:53.254 --> 36:56.216
And we all talked about it
together, as a family.
Me, him and Frank.

36:56.257 --> 37:00.470
We all sat down and we
discussed it. That’s what we do.
That’s my family.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.639
And you’d know that
if you asked about him,

37:02.681 --> 37:04.641
if you asked
your son about him.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.059
But you don’t, do you?

37:06.101 --> 37:07.394
Because you never fucking call

37:07.435 --> 37:09.229
and you never
fucking do anything.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.898
You sent a present
on his seventh birthday.

37:11.940 --> 37:15.527
He doesn’t even get the chance
to talk to his dad.

37:15.568 --> 37:21.199
Have you even thought about
what this all means?

37:21.241 --> 37:22.826
That your son’s missing?

37:22.867 --> 37:24.911
All I’ve been thinking about
this whole time

37:24.953 --> 37:27.414
is that I’m a bad mother,
that I’ve done something wrong.

37:27.455 --> 37:31.501
Have you even thought
for a fucking second
what sort of father you are?

37:31.543 --> 37:35.296
What sort of father
you’ve been to your son?

37:35.338 --> 37:37.132
I know, I know.
I know I’m a bad dad.

37:37.173 --> 37:40.802
I know I’m never here.
I know he can’t rely on me.

37:43.304 --> 37:46.224
But it’s not my fault
he’s gone missing, darling.

37:46.266 --> 37:49.310
[sobbing]

37:51.104 --> 37:53.314
I just...
Hey, hey!

37:53.356 --> 37:55.442
Stop and think
for a minute.

37:55.483 --> 37:59.320
Just think of what
we need you to do.

38:00.155 --> 38:02.073
Frank is not...

38:02.115 --> 38:07.537
He’s a beautiful,
strong, amazing man
who loves your son.

38:09.497 --> 38:11.332
I don’t believe that.

38:22.677 --> 38:23.928
Right.

38:46.534 --> 38:48.078
[knocking on door]

39:14.729 --> 39:17.941
Why do you think
that my phone is being tapped?

39:17.982 --> 39:22.529
Listen. At 2:00 this afternoon,
I got a call from Glasgow.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.073
They asked me
to come off this case.

39:26.616 --> 39:30.954
I said, "Why? Why should I
drop this file? Why?

39:30.995 --> 39:36.668
You must send me
a written explanation
why I should drop this file."

39:36.710 --> 39:40.797
And they yell at me,
shout at me. And I hung up.

39:40.839 --> 39:45.343
At 2:17, I get a call,
this time from London.

39:45.385 --> 39:47.554
From Sir Patrick Nelson.

39:47.595 --> 39:52.058
This man,
he’s higher up than anybody
in the police force in Scotland.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.061
And he tells me this case
will be handled from London.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.063
This time,
I get a chance to say nothing.

39:57.105 --> 40:02.027
He tells me that this is
in everyone’s best interests.

40:02.068 --> 40:03.653
And that’s it.

40:03.695 --> 40:08.533
At 3:00, I tell my team
we’re no longer involved.
And I leave.

40:08.575 --> 40:14.122
I didn’t have much faith
in a kidnapping related to
your work in the oil industry.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.915
I could be wrong.

40:15.957 --> 40:19.210
London must have some
information that I don’t have.

40:19.878 --> 40:21.629
But I’ll tell you this.

40:22.797 --> 40:28.094
You’re on your own.
Basically, you’re on your own,
Mr. Murray.

40:28.136 --> 40:31.514
I can’t stay.
Don’t use your phone.

40:32.098 --> 40:33.183
Thank you.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.687
[exhales]

41:32.450 --> 41:34.202
Come on, darling. Pick up.

41:37.997 --> 41:40.875
-[Leah] Hello?
-Leah?

41:43.712 --> 41:45.714
-Can you hear me?
-What’s this number?

41:45.755 --> 41:47.424
What’s this number
you’re phoning on?

41:47.465 --> 41:48.925
It’s not my phone.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.511
Listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

41:51.553 --> 41:54.389
No, you listen to me.
Do you have any idea
what’s been going on here?

41:54.431 --> 41:57.684
Do you know the cops came
into the office? They turned
the whole place upside down.

41:57.726 --> 42:01.396
They’ve got the computers.
They’ve got the hard drives.
They’ve got everything, Edmond.

42:01.438 --> 42:04.149
-Do you understand
what this means?
-What?

42:04.190 --> 42:07.777
They’ve got all the files.
I mean, they’ve got
the Iraq files.

42:07.819 --> 42:09.487
I mean, Jesus!

42:09.529 --> 42:12.824
Has anybody mentioned my name?
Has anybody been looking for me?

42:13.867 --> 42:16.703
Listen to me.
Listen to me, Edmond, okay?

42:16.745 --> 42:20.206
I’ve gotta tell you this.
Don’t call me again.
Do you understand?

42:20.248 --> 42:22.709
-Leah...
-Do you understand?
I’m sorry.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.294
[call disconnects]

42:53.615 --> 42:56.493
-[Joan on video]
Can I take it off?
-[Frank] Yeah, sure.

42:56.534 --> 42:59.371
-[Joan] Oh, my God!
-Joan.

43:00.372 --> 43:02.832
That is not what
I was expecting at all.

43:04.250 --> 43:06.836
[Frank] What do you think?
It’s amazing, eh?

43:06.878 --> 43:12.217
-[Joan] It’s amazing.
-[Frank] I know!
We can build a house along here.

43:12.258 --> 43:16.012
I was thinking
this is where, you know,
if you wanted to...

43:17.013 --> 43:20.725
we could, you know,
start a family.

43:20.767 --> 43:22.185
Yeah.

43:24.104 --> 43:28.191
Yeah! I want to, yeah.

43:28.233 --> 43:31.486
-[Frank] Well, I love you
very much.
-[Joan] I love you.

43:31.528 --> 43:33.697
You clever, clever man.

43:41.705 --> 43:42.914
[people cheer]

43:42.956 --> 43:45.667
Ready? Make a wish!

43:45.709 --> 43:48.712
Three, two, one! Come on!

43:48.753 --> 43:52.757
[children giggling, chattering]

43:52.799 --> 43:55.844
[boy] One more, one more,
one more. Come on,
come on, come on!

43:55.885 --> 43:57.929
Come on, come on!
Don’t leave me hanging!

43:57.971 --> 44:00.598
-[Ethan blows]
-[Joan and Frank] Yay!

44:00.640 --> 44:04.811
[clapping, cheering]

44:04.853 --> 44:06.104
[Joan] Do you like it?

44:09.399 --> 44:10.984
[Edmond laughs]

44:12.360 --> 44:15.697
[Joan] Okay, okay.
Let’s open the big one now.

44:15.739 --> 44:16.990
This is the one.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.242
This is from Daddy,

44:19.284 --> 44:21.703
who wishes he could be here,
but he can’t be here today.

44:21.745 --> 44:23.705
This is from Dad.

44:27.876 --> 44:30.086
[wrapping paper tearing]

44:34.299 --> 44:37.510
-[Joan] Oh, my God.
-[Frank] Oh, my goodness.

44:37.552 --> 44:41.222
[Joan] What’s that?
It’s a helicopter.

44:41.264 --> 44:44.768
Isn’t that amazing? Yeah?

44:44.809 --> 44:48.855
[Frank] Ethan, how do you like
your present from your dad?

44:48.897 --> 44:52.859
Yeah? Good present? All right!

44:54.194 --> 44:56.404
You’re doing really good.

44:57.072 --> 44:59.032
You’re a good mum.

44:59.074 --> 45:00.867
You are a good mother.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.827
[sobbing]

45:02.869 --> 45:04.371
[Joan] A rocket!

45:04.412 --> 45:06.706
[Frank] Whoa!

45:06.748 --> 45:10.001
[children playing]

45:12.754 --> 45:15.006
Oh, my God!

45:15.048 --> 45:17.384
-[Edmond laughs]
-[Joan squeals]

45:17.884 --> 45:19.511
You got that?

45:19.552 --> 45:22.889
[Frank] Ethan! You having fun?
Are you happy?

45:22.931 --> 45:24.808
You having a good birthday?

45:33.608 --> 45:39.072
Look, Ethan! Look!
What do you think?
It’s pretty cool, eh?

45:40.281 --> 45:42.367
You’re going to be hanging out
with that guy.

45:42.409 --> 45:46.287
Hey? Look at that!

45:47.497 --> 45:49.958
Hi, guys! How you doing?

45:50.000 --> 45:51.459
Yeah, sure.

45:52.460 --> 45:54.963
You want to say goodbye
to your pal?

45:56.297 --> 45:57.924
See ya!

45:59.342 --> 46:01.678
[woman] Are you all ready
for this, junior astronauts?

46:01.720 --> 46:03.888
- Yeah!
-[woman] That’s what I like
to hear!

46:03.930 --> 46:06.599
Okay, so,
just to let you know,
Mums and Dads,

46:06.641 --> 46:09.853
before you head off,
we’ve got loads of busy days--

46:18.319 --> 46:22.657
[Joan] Love you.
You’ll be all right, okay?

46:23.658 --> 46:26.953
Just try and enjoy it.
You’ll have a great time.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.789
[woman] Say bye-bye to them,
Mums and Dads.

46:29.831 --> 46:31.958
[Joan] I love you, darling.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.712
[Frank] Bye, Ethan buddy!
Have fun!

46:35.754 --> 46:37.422
[Joan laughs]

46:38.256 --> 46:39.966
[Frank] Bye, Ethan!

46:48.558 --> 46:50.769
There we go.

46:50.810 --> 46:54.397
[Joan] The first--
The first time
he’s slept away from home.

46:54.439 --> 46:58.026
-Bye, darling! Love you!
-[Frank] Bye, Ethan!

47:04.657 --> 47:08.578
[Frank] Come on,
give us a wave. Bye, bud!

47:46.366 --> 47:48.159
[Frank] Go on, Ethan!

47:56.042 --> 47:58.795
[Joan] Go, go, go!
Come over here.

47:58.837 --> 48:00.380
Go, go, go!

48:01.339 --> 48:03.258
-Who wants a balloon?
-[boy] Me!

48:12.392 --> 48:13.977
[Joan] They’re all tangled up.

48:35.540 --> 48:38.501
[woman] They’re going to be
well-fed. They’re--

48:41.796 --> 48:43.631
[Frank] Astronomy camp--

48:44.215 --> 48:45.467
Have fun!

49:27.884 --> 49:30.345
[muttering]

49:37.686 --> 49:39.979
[line ringing]

49:40.021 --> 49:41.564
[Joan] Hi, are you okay?

49:44.025 --> 49:45.068
Frank?

49:45.860 --> 49:50.115
Hey, Joan.
It’s not Frank. It’s me.

49:52.033 --> 49:54.828
-Why are you calling me
on Frank’s phone?
-I took it off him last night.

49:54.869 --> 49:56.996
The police thought it was mine,
so they gave it back to me.

49:57.038 --> 50:00.083
Please, before you get angry
with me, can you listen to me?

50:00.125 --> 50:02.585
Can I come over? I’ll give you--

50:02.627 --> 50:03.712
Why?

50:06.214 --> 50:08.174
I think I’ve found something.

50:13.221 --> 50:16.141
[Frank] You’re going to be
hanging out with that guy, eh?

50:16.182 --> 50:18.101
[Joan] Isn’t that amazing?

50:19.227 --> 50:20.687
[Frank] Want to say goodbye
to your pal?

50:20.729 --> 50:22.814
I can’t watch this.
Why are we watching this?

50:22.856 --> 50:24.232
[Frank] See ya!

50:26.526 --> 50:28.653
Just have a look at this.

50:30.739 --> 50:32.157
The same car?

50:33.116 --> 50:35.201
Two different places,
two different times,

50:35.243 --> 50:36.786
and the common factor
being our son.

50:36.828 --> 50:38.955
Well, the common factor’s
not our son.

50:38.997 --> 50:41.875
The common factor is that
he was at a birthday party
with all his friends,

50:41.916 --> 50:45.503
and then he went
to adventure camp
with all his friends.

50:45.545 --> 50:48.673
So that’s... It’s probably
just one of the parents’ cars.

50:48.715 --> 50:51.801
That’s fine, that’s fine.
Worst-case scenario,
I’ll turn up at his mate’s house

50:51.843 --> 50:54.721
and I’ll get
a sympathetic cup of tea
with some innocent dad.

50:56.181 --> 50:58.224
I think you need
to call your brother.

50:59.184 --> 51:00.810
Oh, fuck...

51:00.852 --> 51:03.188
Call your brother.
He still works in insurance.

51:03.229 --> 51:06.691
He’ll be able to get
the license plate. He’ll be able
to get the home address.

51:06.733 --> 51:08.610
Yeah, illegally.

51:08.651 --> 51:11.446
I still think... I still think
we should call the police.
I can’t--

51:11.488 --> 51:13.907
I told you before--
I know! I can’t...

51:13.948 --> 51:18.244
We are on our own.
Darling, we are all
that Ethan’s got.

51:18.286 --> 51:20.580
Those were Inspector Roy’s
last words to me.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.503
Call your brother. Now.

51:28.463 --> 51:31.132
They might have
already moved him.
Fine, fine!

51:37.305 --> 51:38.640
Go, go, go.

51:40.684 --> 51:44.813
Rob, Hi. No, I’m sorry.
I’m sorry it’s so early.

51:44.854 --> 51:48.441
Yeah, I know.
No. Nothing yet, no. Um...

51:48.483 --> 51:52.570
Look, I need you to do something
for me, if you can.

51:55.865 --> 51:58.910
I don’t know,
it looks like a house
or a building or something.

51:58.952 --> 52:02.747
It’s in the middle
of nowhere.
It’s not that far away.

52:02.789 --> 52:06.960
If I take the long road,
I can come around
on it from behind.

52:07.002 --> 52:10.797
All right, look,
William O’Connor.
Have you ever heard that name?

52:12.841 --> 52:14.300
No. I don’t know.

52:14.342 --> 52:15.844
All right, fuck it.

52:16.720 --> 52:19.222
Fuck it. All right,
I’ll come with you.

52:19.264 --> 52:21.599
No, no, no, no. No!
You have to let me go.

52:21.641 --> 52:23.309
No, I can’t
just stay here.

52:23.351 --> 52:24.728
If something happens to me,

52:24.769 --> 52:27.022
he’s going to need
one of us. Okay?

52:27.063 --> 52:29.858
Just think before you
do anything, okay?
Don’t do anything stupid.

52:29.899 --> 52:31.985
Uh-huh.
All right?

52:32.027 --> 52:34.863
And if you’re not back
by midday, then
I’m calling the police.

52:34.904 --> 52:36.614
That’s it! Okay?
That’s it, Eddy!

52:37.949 --> 52:39.701
Call Inspector Roy.

52:41.703 --> 52:44.497
All right.
I’ve got Frank’s phone.

53:21.868 --> 53:27.707
Maybe, maybe, maybe,
you might see a shooting star
or a comet or something.

53:27.749 --> 53:32.796
[Frank] Wow! Your mum has done
amazing research into this camp.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.758
I think I just saw
a little smile.

53:41.429 --> 53:45.308
[automated female voice]
You will reach
your destination in 300 yards.

53:55.610 --> 53:59.447
You will reach
your destination in 200 yards.

54:19.968 --> 54:23.930
You will reach
your destination in 100 yards.

54:30.812 --> 54:33.064
You have reached
your destination.

54:38.445 --> 54:39.904
Turn around.

54:42.157 --> 54:43.658
Turn around.

55:47.472 --> 55:50.058
[breathing heavily]

57:03.423 --> 57:05.467
[door creaks]

58:21.876 --> 58:24.087

[thudding]

59:11.426 --> 59:13.011
[metal clanking]

59:36.951 --> 59:42.916
[William] It’s too
dangerous now. I need to wait.
I’ll leave in 20, I think.

59:43.500 --> 59:44.751
Okay.

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:04.813
[hammering]

1:00:08.525 --> 1:00:09.567

1:00:09.609 --> 1:00:11.736
[body thuds]

1:00:43.059 --> 1:00:45.270
[Edmond] Look at me. Look up.

1:00:46.021 --> 1:00:48.106
What the...
Look at me. Look at me.

1:00:48.148 --> 1:00:50.984
Do you know who I am?
No.

1:00:51.026 --> 1:00:53.236
Do you know why I’m here?
No.

1:00:53.695 --> 1:00:55.363
I know who you are.

1:00:55.405 --> 1:00:58.283
What are you
talking about?
I’ve got pictures of you.

1:00:58.324 --> 1:01:00.243
I got pictures
of your car.
My car?

1:01:00.285 --> 1:01:01.995
Outside the Lockey Camp.
What?

1:01:02.037 --> 1:01:03.663
Outside the climbing center
in Crianlarich

1:01:03.705 --> 1:01:05.331
for two weeks
following my son.

1:01:05.373 --> 1:01:06.541
Do you know who I am?

1:01:06.583 --> 1:01:07.667
You’re fucking mental, man.

1:01:07.709 --> 1:01:09.044
Do you know why I’m here?

1:01:09.085 --> 1:01:10.337
You’re making
a mistake here, man!

1:01:10.378 --> 1:01:11.629
This is fucking nothing--

1:01:11.671 --> 1:01:13.673
Tell me what I want to know!

1:01:13.715 --> 1:01:15.884
I don’t know
what you’re fucking
talking about, man.

1:01:15.925 --> 1:01:17.886
Tell me
what I want to know!
What about?

1:01:17.927 --> 1:01:19.929
Where’s my fucking son?

1:01:19.971 --> 1:01:21.306
You’ve made a mistake, man!

1:01:21.348 --> 1:01:22.849
Just fucking untie me
and let me--

1:01:22.891 --> 1:01:24.559
Tell me where
my fucking son is!

1:01:24.601 --> 1:01:28.521
Or I will drive this
up through your mouth,
up through your brain,

1:01:28.563 --> 1:01:31.232
and outta the top
of your fucking head.
Do you understand?

1:01:31.274 --> 1:01:33.777
I don’t fucking know!
You fuck!

1:01:34.569 --> 1:01:36.321
What are you
fucking doing, man?

1:01:36.363 --> 1:01:38.865
Don’t fucking do that, man!
You’ve made a mistake.

1:01:38.907 --> 1:01:43.161
Untie me, let me go,
and I’ll say fuck all
about this, mate, all right?

1:01:45.163 --> 1:01:47.082
Man, what are you
fucking doing?

1:01:48.416 --> 1:01:52.212
Man, don’t fucking do that, man!
I don’t fucking know!

1:01:52.253 --> 1:01:54.547
Tell me where my wee boy is.
I don’t fucking know!

1:01:54.589 --> 1:01:57.384
Fucking tell me where
my wee boy is.
I don’t fucking know.

1:01:57.425 --> 1:02:00.095
[whimpering]

1:02:00.136 --> 1:02:01.888
You going to tell me
where my wee boy is?

1:02:01.930 --> 1:02:04.140
I don’t fucking know...

1:02:07.936 --> 1:02:10.146
What the fuck!
Where’s my fucking son?

1:02:10.188 --> 1:02:13.566
I don’t fucking know, man!
I don’t fucking-- No, man!

1:02:13.608 --> 1:02:16.403
You take my fucking son?
Don’t fucking do that!

1:02:16.444 --> 1:02:19.072
I’m going to burn
your fucking feet off.
No, don’t do that!

1:02:19.114 --> 1:02:20.532
Tell me right now!
I don’t fucking know.

1:02:20.573 --> 1:02:22.617
Where the fuck is my son?
I don’t know.

1:02:22.659 --> 1:02:24.411
Where’s my fucking son?

1:02:24.452 --> 1:02:27.414
[screaming]

1:02:27.455 --> 1:02:30.875
You going to tell me?
Okay, okay, okay!

1:02:36.131 --> 1:02:37.549
Tell me where he is.

1:02:37.590 --> 1:02:39.467
He... He...

1:02:39.509 --> 1:02:41.761
[stammering]

1:02:41.803 --> 1:02:44.097
What? Fucking speak!

1:02:44.139 --> 1:02:45.932
Dunmore Lodge.
Where?

1:02:45.974 --> 1:02:47.767
Dunmore Lodge.
We take ’em there.

1:02:47.809 --> 1:02:50.103
We drop them there
and they come
and pick them up later.

1:02:50.145 --> 1:02:51.813
Who?
I don’t fucking know.

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:55.275
Who?
I fucking swear!
I swear!

1:02:55.316 --> 1:02:58.403
I don’t fucking know that,
man! I swear...

1:02:58.445 --> 1:03:00.280
I don’t fucking touch them, man.

1:03:00.321 --> 1:03:02.907
I’m not like them!
I’m not fucking like them.

1:03:02.949 --> 1:03:07.829
I’m not like that. I just
deliver them. I drop them off
and that’s fucking it.

1:03:09.164 --> 1:03:13.001
You don’t touch them?
Never, man. Never.

1:03:17.922 --> 1:03:19.382
Who touches them?

1:03:21.509 --> 1:03:22.927
Who touches them?

1:03:22.969 --> 1:03:25.555
I don’t know, man.
I just... I take photos.

1:03:25.597 --> 1:03:26.806
Fucking...

1:03:26.848 --> 1:03:29.059
I take photos
outside the schools.

1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:31.561
And then...
And then they pick them.

1:03:33.104 --> 1:03:34.856
I’m sorry, man.

1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:41.488
Don’t fucking hell, man! No!

1:03:58.546 --> 1:04:00.965

1:10:21.137 --> 1:10:22.764
[man 1] He should be here.

1:10:24.182 --> 1:10:25.767
[man 2] Huh?

1:10:25.809 --> 1:10:28.269
[man 1] He should’ve been here
at least 15 minutes ago!

1:10:28.311 --> 1:10:29.979
[man 2] Call him again, then.

1:10:32.315 --> 1:10:35.443
[grunting continues]

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.620
[man 1] William,
where the fuck are you?
You’re late!

1:10:45.662 --> 1:10:47.080
[foosball table rattling]

1:10:47.122 --> 1:10:48.790
[man 2] Come on. Spit it out.

1:10:48.832 --> 1:10:50.792
Get in. Get in.

1:10:53.628 --> 1:10:55.338
He’s still not
picking up.

1:10:55.380 --> 1:10:57.924
-[man 2] Shit!
-[man 1] I don’t like this.

1:10:57.966 --> 1:11:00.593
[man 3] There’s cops everywhere.
They put roadblocks everywhere.

1:11:00.635 --> 1:11:04.639
The whole area’s swarming
with cops. Maybe he got nicked.

1:11:05.890 --> 1:11:08.977
Forget the girl.
Let’s take what we have
and get outta here.

1:11:09.978 --> 1:11:11.980
[man 2] They really wanted
the girl, though.

1:11:14.691 --> 1:11:15.775
Okay.

1:11:17.110 --> 1:11:19.863
We’re not staying here.
Let’s go.

1:11:20.989 --> 1:11:23.992
-Let’s go!
-[man 2] Hurry up!

1:11:36.129 --> 1:11:37.339
Fuck.

1:11:50.435 --> 1:11:51.895
[man 2] Fuck it!

1:11:52.979 --> 1:11:58.318
[man 1]
Steven! It’s fucking flat.
When did that happen?

1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:00.737
[Steven] It must have
been done on the road,
when we drove here.

1:12:00.779 --> 1:12:04.824
Probably a nail or a screw.
Those can make it
deflate slowly.

1:12:04.866 --> 1:12:06.993
It takes me five minutes
to put the spare on.

1:12:07.035 --> 1:12:10.705
Take the kid back inside.
I’ll call you when I’m finished.

1:12:33.395 --> 1:12:36.106

Give me your fucking keys.

Here we go!

[phone chimes]

1:15:25.275 --> 1:15:29.195
Inspector Roy, it’s
Joan Richmond. Can you call me
as soon as you get this?

1:15:33.867 --> 1:15:36.911
Steven! Are you there?

1:15:45.086 --> 1:15:46.588
Are you there?

1:15:49.174 --> 1:15:50.633
Steven!

1:15:51.676 --> 1:15:53.887

Have you seen Steven?
He’s not downstairs?

1:16:29.464 --> 1:16:30.924
Have you got the car keys?

1:16:30.965 --> 1:16:33.593
No, Steven has them.
Where the fuck is he?

1:16:33.635 --> 1:16:34.928
Call him!

1:16:43.144 --> 1:16:45.021
[phone rings]

Shh, shh, shh...

[man 2] Steven,
where the hell are you?

1:16:57.617 --> 1:16:59.285
We’re looking all over for you.

1:17:06.334 --> 1:17:11.798
[Edmond] Listen to me.
That wee boy that you’ve got
is my son.

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:13.633
The police are on their way.

1:17:13.675 --> 1:17:16.845
You have to leave the little boy
where he is and just run away.

1:17:16.886 --> 1:17:18.346
It’s your only shot, pal.

1:17:20.682 --> 1:17:23.018
[man 1] You listen to me, prick.

1:17:24.728 --> 1:17:26.938
I’m coming for you.

1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:30.817
[breathing heavily]

1:17:30.859 --> 1:17:32.652
Stay with the boy.

1:17:32.694 --> 1:17:36.489
What if the cops come?
Bullshit!
Do what I told you.

1:17:36.531 --> 1:17:37.907
Fuck!

Hey, Ethan!

1:21:54.956 --> 1:21:56.833
Ethan, can you wake up, pal?

1:21:56.875 --> 1:21:59.544
Can you wake-- Can you wake up?

1:22:05.383 --> 1:22:08.303
[laughing] You stay asleep.

1:22:49.177 --> 1:22:50.887

1:23:21.876 --> 1:23:22.919
[Joan screams]

1:23:22.961 --> 1:23:24.379
You okay?
Yeah.

1:23:35.015 --> 1:23:36.307
[bullets ricocheting]

1:23:36.349 --> 1:23:38.518
[window shatters]
[groans]

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:39.811
Fuck!

1:23:43.648 --> 1:23:45.984
[groans] Fuck!

1:23:46.026 --> 1:23:48.236
[groaning]

1:23:53.241 --> 1:23:55.243
Is he still following us?

1:23:55.994 --> 1:23:57.412
I can’t see.

1:24:06.004 --> 1:24:07.297
[Edmond] Joan...

1:24:09.924 --> 1:24:10.967
Joan!

1:24:11.009 --> 1:24:12.469
Eddy?

1:24:13.428 --> 1:24:16.598
Eddy!
[screams] Eddy!

1:24:32.030 --> 1:24:34.616
[alarm chiming]

1:24:42.082 --> 1:24:43.458
Eddy?

1:24:48.588 --> 1:24:49.631
Eddy?

1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:52.884
Eddy!

1:24:53.802 --> 1:24:55.220
Eddy!

1:25:15.532 --> 1:25:17.701
[footsteps approaching]

1:25:19.244 --> 1:25:23.957
It’s all right! It’s all right!
It’s me. You’re safe,
you’re safe.

1:25:23.998 --> 1:25:26.251
Oh, geez! The boy...

1:25:26.292 --> 1:25:29.129
The boy is all right.
It’s all right.

1:25:29.170 --> 1:25:31.506
[sobbing]

1:25:53.445 --> 1:25:55.613
[drone buzzing]

1:26:02.620 --> 1:26:04.789
There you go. Just be
real gentle and take it over

1:26:04.831 --> 1:26:06.833
to the left, like that.
Oh, you see it bob like that?

1:26:06.875 --> 1:26:08.918
-[Joan] You want a go?
-[Edmond] Yeah, you want a go?

1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:12.172
-[Ethan] Yeah, sure.
-[Edmond] You want to try it?
Okay.

1:26:12.213 --> 1:26:14.132
Here we go.

1:26:14.174 --> 1:26:17.093
Right. Here we go,
the vital moment,
the transference of power.

1:26:17.135 --> 1:26:18.887
Get your fingers on it.
Ready?

1:26:18.928 --> 1:26:21.431
Get your fingers on it!
There, you’ve got it, wee man.

1:26:21.473 --> 1:26:23.016
It’s all yours.

1:26:23.058 --> 1:26:24.934
Well done, Ethan.

1:26:24.976 --> 1:26:26.394
Well done, pal.

1:26:27.395 --> 1:26:29.939
Is it good? [laughs]

1:26:29.981 --> 1:26:33.485
Don’t bring it
too close towards you.
I want to keep my hair.

1:26:34.152 --> 1:26:35.695
You cheeky thing...

1:26:37.655 --> 1:26:39.032
Whoa!

1:26:39.074 --> 1:26:40.950
[all laughing]

1:26:43.244 --> 1:26:45.372
So good, wee man. So good.

1:26:45.413 --> 1:26:48.500
I’m going to leave this to you,
’cause you seem to know
what you’re doing.

1:26:48.541 --> 1:26:50.543
You do!
Kinda. [laughs]

1:26:50.585 --> 1:26:52.587
It’s making me scared.

1:26:53.463 --> 1:26:55.548
Don’t drop it on our heads!

1:26:57.258 --> 1:26:59.636
Whoa! [laughing]

1:27:01.304 --> 1:27:02.764
Wow!
Wow!

1:27:02.806 --> 1:27:05.141
You’ll be a pilot for the MOD
before you know it.

1:27:05.183 --> 1:27:06.768
[Roy] Mr. Murray!

1:27:11.606 --> 1:27:12.857
[Edmond] Hey, pal...

1:27:14.609 --> 1:27:16.569
I’m going to need to get going.

1:27:16.611 --> 1:27:19.906
Should we land it
and say a proper bye-bye?

1:27:21.950 --> 1:27:23.702
Okay, all right.

1:27:31.292 --> 1:27:32.502
I love you, pal.

1:27:32.544 --> 1:27:34.671
When are you coming back?

1:27:36.256 --> 1:27:37.590
Um...

1:27:40.135 --> 1:27:42.762
I might be
a wee while.
Okay.

1:27:44.347 --> 1:27:45.974
But I am going to come back.

1:27:47.642 --> 1:27:49.477
I’ll come back
and be here, okay?

1:27:49.519 --> 1:27:50.854
[Ethan] Okay.

1:27:57.986 --> 1:27:59.654
[drone buzzing]

1:27:59.696 --> 1:28:00.864
Okay.

1:28:03.366 --> 1:28:05.452
See ya, Joan.
See ya.

1:28:10.957 --> 1:28:12.792
[drone buzzing]

1:28:14.878 --> 1:28:16.671
[laughing]

1:28:31.519 --> 1:28:33.438
You okay?
Yeah.

1:28:35.899 --> 1:28:37.817
Whoa! [laughs]

1:29:07.263 --> 1:29:11.101
The dismantling of the network
is accelerating, you know.

1:29:12.477 --> 1:29:15.772
I believe that there
will be more arrests.

1:29:16.648 --> 1:29:19.609
It’ll be a big list.
What a shame.

1:29:21.778 --> 1:29:24.030
But it could be
good for you.
You think?

1:29:24.072 --> 1:29:28.993
Yes. The judge will probably
take this into account.

1:29:30.036 --> 1:29:31.955
Aye, hopefully.

1:30:04.404 --> 1:30:07.949
[breathes deeply]
