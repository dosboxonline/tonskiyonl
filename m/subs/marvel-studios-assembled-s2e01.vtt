(JANET BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:15.473 --> 00:18.727
We always loved doing
the unexpected with Scott Lang.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.270
(THUDS)

00:20.353 --> 00:23.732
FEIGE: He is arguably the character
that is the most underestimated.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.693
STEPHEN BROUSSARD:
I think back to making the first film,

00:26.776 --> 00:29.529
which was one of the titles
that, when we announced,

00:29.612 --> 00:31.990
people kind of looked at us strangely,
like, "Really, Ant-Man?

00:32.073 --> 00:34.325
"You're going to make a movie about that?
Are you kidding?"

00:34.701 --> 00:35.869
PEYTON REED: We had no idea.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.163
"Is Ant-Man going to work?
Are people going to come see it?"

00:38.246 --> 00:42.459
We were fortunate that I think audiences
really latched on to Scott Lang,

00:42.959 --> 00:45.378
and I think they did
for the same reasons I did.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.838
Daddy!

00:46.921 --> 00:48.131
You can't just show up.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.966
SCOTT: I wanna to be a part of her life.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.968
He is not a super scientist
or a billionaire.

00:52.052 --> 00:56.264
He's just a regular guy
who sort of happened upon this suit

00:56.347 --> 01:01.227
and this technology and got sucked
into this insane Marvel Universe.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.773
When we first started with Ant-Man,
we were a palate cleanser.

01:04.856 --> 01:08.735
Because we were always coming after
the kind of finale-big

01:08.943 --> 01:12.739
Marvel story, the Avengers story
that was ripping people's hearts out.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.033
And ours were light and they were fun
and they were sweet.

01:15.158 --> 01:19.120
But at one point, Ant-Man became the key
to saving a literal universe...

01:19.204 --> 01:21.247
What if we could enter the Quantum Realm?

01:21.331 --> 01:22.874
FEIGE: ...in Avengers: Endgame.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.251
And that is not something
I think people would have predicted

01:25.335 --> 01:27.045
after his first appearance.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.880
So carrying that tradition, we thought,

01:28.963 --> 01:30.465
"What do we do with
another Ant-Man movie?"

01:30.548 --> 01:33.593
And that's really when we hit upon,
"Let's use this film

01:33.676 --> 01:35.261
"to kick off Phase Five."

01:35.345 --> 01:37.180
The film that kicks off Phase Five

01:37.263 --> 01:39.432
-is Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
-(ALL CHEERING)

01:39.516 --> 01:42.018
PAUL RUDD: One of the things
that was really exciting was

01:42.102 --> 01:44.312
knowing that what we were doing

01:44.395 --> 01:46.815
was probably going
to surprise some people.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.777
Like, "Wow. I can't believe
this is an Ant-Man movie."

SCOTT: "Word of advice.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.971
"Look out for the little guy."

02:23.059 --> 02:24.686
RUDD: Ready? Kang walks in.

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
Ready.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.355
So you see him.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.566
And then... And then, I blow it up.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.068
REED: Camera is not going to see
Kang at all before.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.319
But we're gonna see Paul,

02:33.403 --> 02:35.613
we're gonna see Scott's expression
not knowing what it is.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.698
-He pushes her in.
-Oh.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.032
Then he gets blasted away.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.826
Then we reveal Kang.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.744
Oh!

02:41.828 --> 02:45.123
REED: I always knew it would be great
to build to a movie like this.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.833
(CREATURES CHITTERING)

02:48.126 --> 02:51.963
As a kid, I was a big Fantastic Four fan
and Avengers fan,

02:52.088 --> 02:53.256
and I remember stories

02:53.339 --> 02:55.675
where Doctor Doom would shrink down
and you'd realize,

02:55.758 --> 02:57.886
"Oh, there are whole civilizations
deep down there."

02:57.969 --> 03:00.180
They're worlds within worlds,
and it's populated.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.308
And wouldn't it be great to be able
to get to that at some point?

03:03.516 --> 03:06.644
From that were the early seeds
for what Quantumania could be.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.021
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:08.104 --> 03:11.149
BROUSSARD: This was all sort of
established in the second film...

03:11.274 --> 03:12.275
Mom?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.652
BROUSSARD: ...where Janet is rescued
from the Quantum Realm.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.656
We hint at what
the Quantum Realm could be,

03:18.740 --> 03:22.744
we hint that there's maybe more
than just a lifeless void down there.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.914
There's even some Easter eggs
if you go back and slow down

03:25.997 --> 03:29.959
the second film, where you see
what looks like subatomic cities.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.756
It's me.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.926
BROUSSARD: And she's wearing clothes,
that, "Where did these clothes come from?"

03:38.009 --> 03:39.385
Somewhere in the back of our mind,

03:39.469 --> 03:42.472
we knew if we ever were
lucky enough to get to a Part 3,

03:42.555 --> 03:43.598
the seeds for that idea,

03:43.681 --> 03:47.936
the seeds for going from
small San Francisco crime movies

03:48.019 --> 03:53.066
to a sci-fi epic that has more in common
with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars,

03:53.149 --> 03:55.151
that was the starting place
for Quantumania.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.447
But we were very conscious of
this film feeling like its own thing.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.574
And we spent a year concepting this film.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.703
It's the longest run of concept time
that I've ever had on a film at Marvel.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.957
REED: The way this hood is hanging over,
that's pretty cool there.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.585
Because you can just barely see the eyes,
so that then when there's the reveal...

04:12.961 --> 04:14.254
Before we release...

04:14.337 --> 04:16.339
One of my big influences on this
was just going through

04:16.422 --> 04:20.468
old '60s and '70s and '80s
science fiction paperbacks

04:20.551 --> 04:22.095
and looking at the covers.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.681
And they were all about just
creating these whacked-out worlds.

04:24.764 --> 04:29.352
But also, I think you can't do a movie
like this without looking at Moebius.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.229
Things like Flash Gordon.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.023
So literally,
we had everything on the table.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.483
The best thing about

04:37.443 --> 04:38.569
doing a sequel

04:39.112 --> 04:42.282
is the opportunity to work
with the people you worked with before.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.449
So there's a familiarity.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.578
You don't have to go in like strangers
and kind of feel your way out.

04:47.662 --> 04:51.082
When you're lucky enough to get to tell
a third film in your series,

04:51.165 --> 04:54.711
it means that you've been together
with some of these cast members for years,

04:54.794 --> 04:58.631
and with that comes a lot of trust
about the kind of story you're telling.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.385
It's anchored by these amazing actors,

05:02.510 --> 05:05.555
you know, and the choices we made
going back to that first film.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.725
And you look at actors
like Evangeline Lilly, Paul Rudd,

05:08.808 --> 05:12.562
Michael Douglas, and Michelle Pfeiffer,
who joined in the second film.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.397
These are heavyweight talents.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.650
These are absolute world-class actors,

05:17.734 --> 05:20.570
which help sell the craziness
of this world.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.159
We'll see about that.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.411
RUDD: Scott Lang,
he's had a lot to digest.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.206
We start this film.
The events of Endgame have happened.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.669
And now, I think that,
for the first time in many years,

05:36.794 --> 05:41.257
Scott is able to take a breath
and kind of sit back

05:41.341 --> 05:43.217
and spend some time with his daughter

05:43.301 --> 05:48.097
and enjoy just being present
in his own life.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.893
But that doesn't last that long,
that peace.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.686

05:56.522 --> 05:57.815
(SCOTT BREATHING HEAVILY)

06:00.068 --> 06:02.028
JEFF LOVENESS:
Scott is just a dad who realizes

06:02.111 --> 06:04.364
that he's accidentally
brought his daughter

06:04.447 --> 06:05.907
into this world with him now.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.576
And now he sees, like,
"Oh, man, I can't really play this

06:08.659 --> 06:09.994
"as loose as I usually do.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.871
"I got to keep my daughter safe."

06:12.038 --> 06:15.750
And so I really tried
to lean into the likeability

06:15.833 --> 06:17.960
and the everyman charm of Paul Rudd.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.506
On top of that, he can deliver any joke
and make it ten times better

06:21.589 --> 06:22.632
just by saying it.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.758
CASSIE: Hmm.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.927
It's like we're camping.
We love camping.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.304
CASSIE: We've never been camping.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.473
But we've always
talked about it.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.770
He is just endlessly coming up
with different ways to come at a scene.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.814
You know, we work very hard
on the screenplay and,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.732
and get it where we want it,
and we shoot that.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.694
But we always mix it up
and, you know, nine times out of ten,

06:43.778 --> 06:47.865
Paul's going to figure out a better,
funnier way to tell that story.

to play Evangeline Lilly

07:02.296 --> 07:04.632
as, like, the straight-edge, high status,

07:04.715 --> 07:07.218

07:07.343 --> 07:09.846
She really surprised me with her
just dead-on deliveries.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.098
She's been, uh,
really great in this movie.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.684
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

07:14.767 --> 07:17.979
(CHUCKLES) No. No anything.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.816
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.
If you want.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.861
I'll be honest and tell you
it's been really difficult.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.988
Because I...

07:27.071 --> 07:30.116
Every time I revisit Hope,
every time I come back for a new film,

07:30.199 --> 07:33.453
I realize I have to reinvent her,

07:33.536 --> 07:35.621
I have to figure out who she is now,

07:35.746 --> 07:37.915
what that looks like and how to make sure

07:37.999 --> 07:40.126
that it doesn't look like
a completely different person,

07:40.209 --> 07:42.420
like that there's a through line
that you still see Hope

07:42.503 --> 07:43.504
and you feel her.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.382
REED: I think maybe a little bit
of a drift in, right?

07:46.507 --> 07:48.926
-There's a whole thing I can see.
-REED: Yeah, there's a force field

07:49.010 --> 07:50.678
that goes all the way
around this thing, right?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.305
-Okay.
-So taking that in,

07:52.388 --> 07:54.307
a little bit of a, a move in,

07:54.390 --> 07:56.517
and then I'll cue you for, um...

07:56.601 --> 07:59.520
You've got to do something.
That's where you dig for the thing.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.856
I used to jokingly talk
about the first film,

08:01.939 --> 08:06.068
like she was just always in a bad mood
and kind of had attitude.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.280
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.991
LILLY: But by the second film already,
I felt like I had to drop that,

08:12.074 --> 08:14.035
because she was in a much better place.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.330
So, each film, I'm like,
"Wait, who is she and how do I play that?

08:17.413 --> 08:19.207
"And how do I make sure
that it's still Hope?"

08:19.290 --> 08:21.876
And it's been a challenge,
but a challenge that I welcome.

LILLY: In Ant-Man and the Wasp,

08:29.842 --> 08:31.969
Hope brought her mother back
from the Quantum Realm,

08:32.053 --> 08:33.763
and was very, very excited.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.474
I think she might have had
little girl fantasies

08:36.557 --> 08:37.975
about what that reunion would be like.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.977
Mommy and I will
tell each other everything.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.312
We'll be best of friends.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.897
I missed you so much.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.858
I missed you too, jellybean.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.111
What we don't see
between the last film and this one

08:49.195 --> 08:54.075
is that she wasn't so open.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.827
She wasn't so intimate.
She wasn't so vulnerable.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.376
(ALL PANTING)

09:04.710 --> 09:09.215
There was a closed-off part of her
that Hope couldn't reach

09:09.298 --> 09:10.633
and it hurts.

09:10.716 --> 09:16.472

-Mm-hmm.
-Why didn't you ask me about it?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.065
I tried, Mom.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.483
A lot.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.110
You never wanted
to talk about it.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.906
Michelle and I were really passionate
about that part of the story.

09:33.990 --> 09:38.452
And we spent a lot of time
making that really honest.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.121
We didn't want it glossed over.

09:40.204 --> 09:44.041
We didn't want their tension to be cute.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.169
You said there was nothing
down here.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.504
Why didn't you tell us about this?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.256
I will explain everything,
but right now...

09:50.339 --> 09:52.383
-I need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

09:53.467 --> 09:57.138

about the movie

LOVENESS: This is that movie
with a legendary movie star,

10:21.370 --> 10:25.499
and it's her past coming back
to destroy her family.

10:25.708 --> 10:32.423
And Michelle brought so much
pathos and guilt to this character.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.760
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.637
What did you do?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.889
(PANTING)

10:40.681 --> 10:44.310
MICHELLE PFEIFFER: This is the first film
where I think we really get to know Janet.

10:44.810 --> 10:49.690
I do think she struggles
with feeling like an outsider.

10:52.193 --> 10:56.364
It's interesting. On the previous film,
I just wasn't there for that long.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.157
REED: And, cut! Yeah. Great.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.035
PFEIFFER: I think
I sort of maybe left the last one

11:01.118 --> 11:03.204
feeling still a little bit of an outsider,

11:03.746 --> 11:05.289
because my visit was so brief.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.374
(GASPS)

11:10.086 --> 11:11.295
Let's go home.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
But this one, we were really in
the trenches together

11:13.589 --> 11:14.882
for a very long time.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.718
I even said to Michael one day,
I turned to him and I said,

11:17.802 --> 11:22.640
"I'm just so happy
that I got to know you on this film."

11:23.265 --> 11:25.476
It's watching and learning
from each other.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.812
And, you know, Michael is hysterical,

11:27.895 --> 11:29.563
no matter what you give him to say.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.190
I love ants.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.151
I (BLEEP) love ants.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.656
DOUGLAS: There's just a fun factor to it,

11:38.739 --> 11:42.159
to get into this other world,
you know, the Quantum Realm.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.121
And "anything goes" is a trip.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.459
What I discovered
about Michael Douglas in these movies

11:50.543 --> 11:51.794
is how funny he is.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.462
You read my book?

11:54.255 --> 11:57.216
Every goddamn word.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.095
I think the general audience
thinks of Michael

12:01.220 --> 12:03.305
in, you know, sexy thrillers,

12:03.389 --> 12:06.934
and his great commanding voice,
and he's an incredible dramatic actor.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.562
But his comedic chops are fantastic.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.397
She had some questions, okay?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.858
I can't help if people
are inspired by me.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.110
He really is Hollywood royalty.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.447
So to get him as Hank Pym
in that first movie was exciting.

12:19.989 --> 12:24.118
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.786
What does that mean?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.079
(WARBLES)

12:27.163 --> 12:29.165
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.918
REED: And to build this character of Hank,
who is a mentor character to Scott.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.920
But he's kind of a bent mentor, right?

12:35.546 --> 12:38.924
Hank, I'm a thief.
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.553
There's some
morally gray areas, uh, about Hank,

12:42.636 --> 12:44.680
and he can be a bit of a curmudgeon.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.683
But I love Michael's energy
in a big way in this movie.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.685
I would've just broken you out
with ants.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.271
All right, you know what? Family meeting.
Can we have a family meeting?

12:52.354 --> 12:53.355
Isn't that what we're doing?

12:53.522 --> 12:54.523
Yeah, I mean about this.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.692
About everybody
being so fine with this.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.953
We had discussions about who
the villain of this movie was going to be,

13:08.037 --> 13:13.501
and we loved the idea of pitting Ant-Man
against a major Marvel villain.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.211
You're an interesting man...

13:19.006 --> 13:20.508
Scott Lang.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.218
Kang the Conqueror came to mind

13:22.343 --> 13:25.304

since I was a kid, in the comics.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.764
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

13:32.686 --> 13:34.772
That excited us, to take the Avenger

13:34.855 --> 13:37.733
who might be perceived
as certainly the tiniest Avenger,

13:37.817 --> 13:41.904
and putting him up against this
powerful, powerful multiversal villain.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.286
KANG: You're an Avenger?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.291
Have I killed you before?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.755
They all blur together
after a while.

14:00.506 --> 14:06.220
Audiences have seen a version
of this character in the series Loki.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.349
This is wild. (CHUCKLES)

14:14.812 --> 14:15.938
He Who Remains.

It's a very different character.
It's just a variation.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.404
LOVENESS: He Who Remains
is kind of squirrelly guy

14:23.487 --> 14:25.322
who hides away at the end of time,

14:25.447 --> 14:27.241
and this is the guy he's afraid of.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.121
This is Kang the Conqueror.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.713
This is the version that every other
version of him is terrified of,

14:40.796 --> 14:44.800
so terrified that they had to ambush him
and banish him down to the Quantum Realm.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.817
I can take any universe I want.

15:04.069 --> 15:09.116
The Ant-Man franchise, within the MCU,
has a very clear ethos

15:09.199 --> 15:11.911
has a very clear rhythm to it.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.208
I had the benefit of stepping into

REED: The Marvel movies, I think,
are at their best when you have a villain

15:42.608 --> 15:45.194
that is a really compelling character.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.614
A villain who has a very clear agenda...

15:48.697 --> 15:50.115
Just be glad I need you.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.076

15:52.159 --> 15:56.372
that you kind of relate
to their point of view despite yourself.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.375

to really, really embody that.

KATY O'BRIAN: When it came to the costume,

16:13.597 --> 16:16.266
Kang is very much
this futuristic character.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.728
He's very foreign in a lot of ways
to our culture and to our world.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.899
So he has a very different,
very sleek, futuristic appeal.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.860
That's what conquerors do.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.155
They burn the broken world.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.368
And they make a new one.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.203
It's always a challenge
when you're bringing

16:36.286 --> 16:39.331
a Marvel Comics character
from a two-dimensional page

16:39.415 --> 16:42.334
into a living, breathing person
in a movie.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.004
Because a lot of those designs,
almost all of them were,

16:45.087 --> 16:46.880
you know, originated in the '60s.

16:46.964 --> 16:50.092
But we looked at all the panels
and we really embraced these things,

16:50.175 --> 16:54.471
and how can we do the sort of
21st-century version of that thing?

16:54.930 --> 16:59.435

and, and making them feel real.

SAMMY SHELDON DIFFER:
This was probably

17:05.691 --> 17:07.651
the most difficult costume
on the film to make.

17:07.776 --> 17:13.157
The concept was drawn in a way that
you couldn't tell what the fabric was,

17:13.240 --> 17:16.827
whether it's hard or soft,
so we had to experiment.

17:16.910 --> 17:22.124
I think this is the third version
of how we solved the problem.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.335
IVO COVENEY: What Peyton was really
keen on was the lines of this...

17:25.419 --> 17:26.712
It was this line.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.130
-Yeah.
-Comic book accurate.

17:28.213 --> 17:32.342
So he wanted the size of that collar.
He wanted these lines flowing down.

17:32.426 --> 17:36.055
And although we had that, they had to be
broken up to allow for more movement.

17:38.974 --> 17:44.188
Starting out, they brought the costume
completely into the trailer.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.483
And I did take a moment.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.654
And then once I put it on,
I went, "Mmm, this is it."

17:52.738 --> 17:57.534
You know, like, there are very few moments
in my life where you go, "This is it."

There's mysticism about it, you know.
It's iconic.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.179
I think one of the hardest
things in this film

18:17.262 --> 18:19.348
from a design point of view
was to find that balance

18:19.431 --> 18:21.975
of a certain amount
of familiarity about things,

18:22.059 --> 18:25.020
but not be exactly what you think it is.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.357
One of the things that I looked at
quite early on were

18:28.482 --> 18:31.527
natural photography
and electron microscopy

18:31.610 --> 18:33.654
and just trying to find colors
and textures

18:33.737 --> 18:36.740
to help take it from
it just being this sort of

18:36.824 --> 18:38.826
hard surface, technological world

18:38.909 --> 18:41.453
to having this slightly more
organic feeling to it.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.831
And that's quite a tricky thing,
to strike that balance.

18:44.414 --> 18:47.126
I just started with some
initial sort of sketches,

18:47.209 --> 18:50.420
put together a bunch of reference boards
and materials for Peyton,

18:50.504 --> 18:52.422

in 3D, all around you on the stage.

otherworldly characters,

20:05.913 --> 20:08.749

on this film is inventing every look

20:40.614 --> 20:42.157
and every idea from the ground up.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.077
And at every angle, we've asked ourselves,

'What's the Quantum Realm version of this?

O'SULLIVAN: We were getting
some very unusual designs.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.907
This guy is Pixel Man,
he was a great favorite.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.784
The idea of him is that he looks like

21:25.867 --> 21:28.620
a collection of pixels
floating in the space

21:28.704 --> 21:31.581
that are kind of concentrated
and become the body of a human.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.002
We had a lovely guy called Kintsugi Man.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.465
This lovely gentleman here
actually was one of our stuntmen.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.051
So we knew he was going
to have to perform stunts.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.679
So I wanted a fairly robust makeup.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.349
I mean, obviously, he couldn't have
anything as delicate as those.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.185
We completely covered him,
and he had prosthetic pieces.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.896
You can see these are all built up

21:54.980 --> 21:57.316
to give him this sort of
slightly broken look.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.360
We also had a lovely chap
we called Ribbon Man,

22:00.444 --> 22:03.405
because I wanted it
to look like his face was unraveling.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.742
So we drew, like,
a bandaged effect on his face.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.577
And then we had these ribbons coming off,

22:08.660 --> 22:11.371
but we had the inside
of the ribbon dark blue,

22:11.455 --> 22:13.081
which, if you looked
at the back of his skull,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.000
looked like it was the inside of his head.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.420
Some of the things you really couldn't
physically make them.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.131
To actually sculpt them
with your hands would be very difficult.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.259
So I just exploited 3D printing
like crazy.

22:24.885 --> 22:30.223
That was the first for me, to actually
do a 3D-printed mold and produce pieces

22:30.307 --> 22:33.393
that were to merge with the skin.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.979
There are moments when you are
reading the script, and you go,

22:36.063 --> 22:39.524
"I just struggle to understand
what that is as a concept."

22:40.359 --> 22:43.487
And then you kind of get into it
and you start spitballing ideas,

22:43.570 --> 22:45.155
and artworking up stuff.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.866
And then it tends to have
a life of its own.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.162
Good example of that would be
the controls for Krylar's yacht.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.246
(SQUELCHING)

22:53.497 --> 22:55.749
Where are the controls?

22:55.832 --> 22:56.875
Those are the controls.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.126
(SQUELCHING)

22:58.502 --> 22:59.544
What the hell?

23:03.548 --> 23:05.967
O'SULLIVAN: Initially,
it was called a dielectric gel,

23:06.510 --> 23:10.222
and it's used for waterproofing
electrical components.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.933
It's a very sticky, mucusy jelly,

23:13.016 --> 23:15.560
and it's not really of any use to us.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.938
But I started mixing it
with another material,

23:18.021 --> 23:22.025
and I was able to harden it
and change the properties of it

23:22.109 --> 23:24.277
to make it much more useful
as a prosthetic.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.613
REED: And let's start that up!

23:26.696 --> 23:28.949
HTAY: Sometimes you just have to
take a risk and experiment,

23:29.032 --> 23:30.867
and I think we got
a great physical result.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.121
And I've got to say, Michael Douglas
was an absolute professional.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.461
-Hello.
-Whoa!

23:41.628 --> 23:42.629
VEB: Hi. (CHUCKLES) Hi.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.089
Did you drink the ooze?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.426
-Why can I understand you?
-VEB: Oh.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.593
Great. That's the ooze.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.887
Hey, everybody, It worked!
Ooze worked!

23:50.971 --> 23:52.305
(ALL CHEERING)

23:52.389 --> 23:57.060
Veb, he's just this blob
with these weird, creepy arms.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.146
Hi. I am Veb. You just drank me.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.230
I did... What?

24:00.355 --> 24:02.566
This is amazing, because it's so weird.

24:02.691 --> 24:06.153
We knew we needed someone to inhabit it
in ways where would come to life,

24:06.236 --> 24:07.821
even though it's a fully CG character.

24:07.904 --> 24:11.324
You wanted to feel personality
and feel the performance of that.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.286
VEB: I have holes.

24:14.369 --> 24:18.540
BROUSSARD: Very early on, we hit upon
the idea of inviting David Dastmalchian

24:18.623 --> 24:20.333
back to the Ant-Man franchise

24:20.417 --> 24:23.545
to play a completely different character
than he had played

24:23.628 --> 24:25.046
in the first two films.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.382
Oh, that's Kurt.
He was at Folsom for five years.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.842
He's a wizard on that laptop.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.095
-Nice meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.223
When Peyton told me about the role,
I'd never done anything like this before.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.642
What would this look like?
How would they involve me?

24:37.726 --> 24:41.062
Was I just going to get to go to a booth
at some point and give my voice?

24:41.146 --> 24:43.106
To me, what I wanted

24:43.190 --> 24:47.694
was the opportunity to, like,
be there on set.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.029
A big hole.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.530
How many holes do you have?

24:51.114 --> 24:52.532
I'm sorry.
Is that a personal question?

24:52.616 --> 24:53.909
I don't have any holes.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.412
DASTMALCHIAN: When I stepped foot
for the very first time

24:57.496 --> 25:00.040
on the set of the Quantum Realm,

25:00.165 --> 25:05.545
it was like all my childhood dreams
of making movies coming to life.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.049
There was so much practical
set building happening there,

25:09.132 --> 25:11.635
and then all the magnificent imagination.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.137
We got to make sort of like
a Marvel Wizard of Oz

25:14.221 --> 25:18.350
which I felt was, like,
"What an insane opportunity."

25:18.934 --> 25:20.227
You can read minds?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.563
Yeah, and I really wish
I couldn't.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.399
Everyone is disgusting.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.484
(ELECTRICAL RINGING)

25:27.567 --> 25:29.986
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

25:30.070 --> 25:34.491
LOVENESS: I had so much fun because I got
to write a corner of the Marvel Universe

25:35.075 --> 25:36.868
that basically felt like fresh territory.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.038
REED: You guys will take off your hoods...
You let go of him,

25:40.121 --> 25:42.958
take off your hoods,
and reveal that you're fuzzy,

25:43.041 --> 25:44.459
cute little owl creatures.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.254
LOVENESS: We got to populate it
with so many creatures,

25:47.337 --> 25:51.049
and they built subcultures
and they built languages.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.552
-(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)
-(GRUNTS)

25:53.635 --> 25:54.886
LOVENESS: It's just incredible.

25:54.970 --> 25:58.598
Every second you see on camera
had so much thought behind it,

25:58.848 --> 26:01.434
whereas I'm sitting here on camera
and I was like, "Well, you know,

26:01.518 --> 26:03.019
"there's a broccoli guy, He's drunk.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.688
"He speaks the broccoli language."

26:05.814 --> 26:07.774
So, what's your story then?

26:08.316 --> 26:09.609
JANET: Move.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.653
It's time. Follow me.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.115
LOVENESS: We just tried
to make this as heightened

26:15.198 --> 26:18.076
and as colorful
and as vibrant as possible.

26:18.159 --> 26:21.413
At the same time, you had no rules,
but you also had to make your own rules.

26:21.496 --> 26:25.166
And luckily, those rules could be,
you know, whatever you wanted them to be.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.376

26:31.339 --> 26:32.841

-Yes! Yes!

26:32.924 --> 26:34.676
MAN: All right, and back it up.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.305
-What do we do with our hands?
-MAN: Back it up.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.723
-Superhero stuff.
-Superhero stuff.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.600
Oh, look at that! She's a natural.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.643
One of our philosophies
that we've always applied

26:43.727 --> 26:46.855
is to just go back to character
and to root it in character.

26:46.980 --> 26:51.943
And the science fiction
and the world building is fun.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.486
Dad!

26:54.529 --> 26:56.072
(MUSIC PLAYING)

26:57.782 --> 26:59.367
But, ultimately, it's window dressing

26:59.451 --> 27:02.454
to this story about a father
and his daughter reconnecting.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.831
(GRUNTS) Dad! (PANTING)

27:05.415 --> 27:09.586
RUDD: As far as having Kathryn
now play Cassie as a young adult,

27:09.669 --> 27:11.671
it was great because it's life.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.215
It's much different dealing
with a 6-year-old...

27:14.299 --> 27:17.552
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.972
RUDD: ...than it is somebody who's 18.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.849
SCOTT: Cassie. What happened?

27:23.767 --> 27:24.976
Jail stuff.

27:25.060 --> 27:29.481
And so, I think the thing that was fun
was watching Kathryn

27:29.564 --> 27:32.025
kind of take on Cassie

27:32.651 --> 27:37.697
and play a character who wants to find
her own way, discover who she is,

27:37.781 --> 27:41.076
and maybe butt heads
with her dad a little bit.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.662
-(SCOTT GRUNTS)
-Okay. I have a suit.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.538
Yeah, I noticed.

27:46.623 --> 27:50.293
Oh, man. When I read the script
for the first time,

27:50.377 --> 27:53.546
the thing I was the most stoked on
was Cassie's character.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.006
(GRUNTS)

27:57.217 --> 27:58.677
REED: Yeah. One more.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.762
-MAN: Look there.
-Okay.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.889
For about, I don't know,

28:03.473 --> 28:06.101
(STAMMERS) five years now,

28:06.184 --> 28:11.648
I've been pestering Marvel Studios
about their female characters.

28:11.731 --> 28:15.318
Saying, like, "We're all very competent.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.237
"We're all very kickass.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.531
"We're all very serious,

28:20.115 --> 28:22.534
"very responsible women who make sure

28:22.617 --> 28:25.870
"that we keep the boys in line
and we do everything perfectly.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.124
"And when I look around
at the women in my life,

28:29.207 --> 28:32.252
"there are so many
other colors to the female

28:32.335 --> 28:34.754
"that I would like to see in your movies."

28:34.838 --> 28:38.425
And then I read the script
and Cassie is just...

28:38.550 --> 28:41.928
She's like, zany and brazen

28:42.011 --> 28:48.184
and kind of, like, irresponsible
in a fantastically, um, pure way.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.936
-And Kathryn killed it.

It worked!

Look at me.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.954
I'm such a dick.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.248
It's never too late
to stop being a dick.

29:10.331 --> 29:11.374
Okay?

29:11.458 --> 29:15.170
REED: Audiences who have a relationship
with young Cassie,

29:15.253 --> 29:18.006
Abby Ryder Fortson, who played her
in the first two Ant-Man movies.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.300
I feel like they want to know

29:20.383 --> 29:22.886
that the daughter of Scott Lang
grows up to be funny.

29:22.969 --> 29:26.931
And grows up to be a bright, optimistic
person in the way that Scott Lang is.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.185
That was really, really
crucial for this movie.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.938
And I'd seen Kathryn in a screen test
that she had done for another Marvel role.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.858
-Director Fury sent you.
-Wow. Who?

29:36.941 --> 29:38.359

29:38.693 --> 29:39.861
-Oh. Oh.
-BARTON: Fury.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.321
You mean Mr. Good Eye.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.697
-No.
-BARTON: Yeah, he loved you.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.283
Like I said,
I was on a rooftop at Third...

29:45.366 --> 29:47.160
There's more cookies. Oh, my God.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.913
It's like, wow, she has this brightness
to her. She's funny.

29:50.538 --> 29:53.500
She has this youthful optimism about her.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.751
And she has the physicality.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.212
She's an athlete.
So I really wanted someone

29:57.295 --> 30:00.924
who could do all the physical demands
that that role required.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.842
And Kathryn was just terrific.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.094
For a lot of the movie,
our heroes are split up.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.388
And Scott and Cassie
are on one side of the story.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.767
So I needed someone
who could really, really hang with Scott

30:10.850 --> 30:12.936
because it was important
for the dynamic of the movie.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.314
So I needed an actor
in the role to play Cassie

30:16.397 --> 30:18.900
who could really spar with Paul Rudd.

30:19.359 --> 30:20.860

And Peyton was like,
"Okay, now do one for fun."

31:03.653 --> 31:06.364
And I was like, "Okay."
So I started improvising.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.408
(LAUGHING) And I did,
like, whatever I wanted.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.910
And then afterwards, Paul was like,
"You've got to do that."

31:10.994 --> 31:13.079
He's like, "You don't want
to finish this movie

31:13.162 --> 31:15.206
"and feel like you held anything back."

31:15.290 --> 31:18.459
He's like, "'Cause that's the worst thing.
And the truth is, You just have to kind of

31:18.543 --> 31:20.712
"throw it all down, do everything you got

31:20.795 --> 31:22.338
"and just make sure you didn't hold back."

31:22.505 --> 31:24.549

from the comic book.

32:24.150 --> 32:27.654
I think if you were doing one,
from a sewing perspective,

32:27.737 --> 32:30.406
it's probably about two weeks' sewing,
but that doesn't include

32:30.490 --> 32:33.576
the backpack and the helmets,
all their extra bits and pieces.

32:33.660 --> 32:38.039
Even though we had a long time to prep,
there was a change in the concept

32:38.122 --> 32:40.750
of what the suits were during prep.

32:40.833 --> 32:44.253
So originally they were meant
to be Quantum Realm suits,

32:44.337 --> 32:46.047
and then that changed.

32:46.130 --> 32:50.134
We almost had to start again,
so they became less of a kind of team,

32:50.218 --> 32:52.011
and slightly more individual.

32:52.261 --> 32:53.930
(ENGINE WHIRRING)

32:56.474 --> 32:59.560
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

33:02.563 --> 33:03.690
REED: For this movie,

33:03.773 --> 33:06.567
we needed a character
who sort of had this backstory with Janet

33:06.651 --> 33:09.988
and it was a role that needed
someone who had a real presence.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.865
Um... And we thought of Bill Murray.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.912
Janet Van Dyne?

33:17.996 --> 33:19.831
I thought you were dead.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.375
Been a long time, Krylar.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.878
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.964
I fought like hell
against that.

33:28.047 --> 33:31.342
I was intrigued by the idea
of putting Bill Murray in a Marvel movie.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.721
I was obviously a fan of his movies
growing up in the '80s

33:34.804 --> 33:36.764
and watching him on Saturday Night Live.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.434
But I also knew that,
pre-Saturday Night Live,

33:39.517 --> 33:44.772
Bill Murray had played the Human Torch
in the Fantastic Four radio show in 1975,

33:44.856 --> 33:46.107
and I listened to that as a kid.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.275
So we talked about that.

33:47.358 --> 33:52.030
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

33:52.280 --> 33:54.240
LOVENESS: Bill came on set
the first couple weeks.

33:54.323 --> 33:57.910
He was giving just these micro notes
on joke construction.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.913
"Switch that word with that word
and maybe take a pause right there."

34:00.997 --> 34:03.791
And you're like, "Bill Murray
knows what he's talking about."

34:04.667 --> 34:06.961
We never wanted anyone
to guess who he was playing.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.214
The Internet is full of all these rumors,
and no one knows who is going to be.

34:10.298 --> 34:13.593
We chose someone
they would literally never guess.

34:16.596 --> 34:20.516
We tried to find the deepest cut
Marvel character we could

34:20.600 --> 34:24.520
and we found this random character
from a random Hulk comic book

34:24.604 --> 34:27.065
in the Quantum Realm called Lord Krylar.

34:27.857 --> 34:28.983
(SCREAMS)

34:29.776 --> 34:32.445
For the costume, you know,
I talked with Stephen and Peyton

34:32.528 --> 34:34.989
about, "Who is he?
Do you want him more military?

34:35.073 --> 34:36.699
"Do you want him more civilian?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.577
"Can we get away with a suit,
or do you want him more bizarre?"

34:39.660 --> 34:43.247
And I think that, um, vis dev
went through a whole load of things

34:43.456 --> 34:46.626
of it being very, very like, Quantum
and weird and fashiony

34:46.709 --> 34:49.629
and strange textures and stuff,

34:49.754 --> 34:52.548
and that became too theatrical.

34:52.632 --> 34:56.344
So we came up with this blue
and cream and gold combo. (CHUCKLES)

34:57.011 --> 34:59.597
Uh, and just tried to have
a bit of fun with it

34:59.680 --> 35:03.142
rather than, um, getting into too many
kind of crazy patterns and stuff.

35:03.226 --> 35:06.062
Bill brings a lot to the table,
and what you don't want to do is

35:06.145 --> 35:09.232
swamp that with
a confusing, complicated look.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.943
In the end, we pulled it all back
and we get one of these guys

35:12.026 --> 35:14.570
that's in the French Riviera,
that has their yacht,

35:14.654 --> 35:17.949
and just added little Quantum elements
like weird bits of beading,

35:18.032 --> 35:19.909
and strange lines running across the body.

35:19.992 --> 35:24.789
So there's some continuity of shapes with
Will's designs for all the environments.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.250
When Peyton came to me in the first place

35:27.333 --> 35:29.627
and we started talking
about this whole project

35:30.169 --> 35:35.258
and the idea of the Quantum Realm
being this vast worlds within worlds,

35:35.341 --> 35:37.552
he wanted it to feel like it was huge.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.224
I'm really happy with
how Janet's homestead turned out,

35:43.307 --> 35:46.394
because it's very much
in my initial sketches

35:46.477 --> 35:49.647
and playing with ideas to Peyton,
this idea of subatomic particles

35:49.730 --> 35:53.401
and that maybe the abode that she lived in
was such a tiny particle,

35:53.484 --> 35:59.949
and it crashed down through various Quanta
and landed on a plain and had died,

36:00.032 --> 36:02.201
and its energy had dissipated over time.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.829
And that became this kind of
cave-like structure.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.123
That was realized in quite a nice way.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.545
This is the exterior of Janet's homestead,

36:12.628 --> 36:14.672
and what we wanted to do here,
we were talking about

36:14.755 --> 36:17.800
from early on, was almost
to have it like a prairie land,

36:17.884 --> 36:21.762
like an old Western, like an old-timer
who was seeing out their days.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.015
And this set was meant
to echo that, really,

36:24.098 --> 36:26.976
the idea of some weird
Quantum prairie land

36:27.059 --> 36:28.811
with these strange Quantum plants,

36:28.895 --> 36:31.981
and this would be developed by VFX

36:32.064 --> 36:35.151
and extended into
much bigger, greater rolling plains.

36:42.825 --> 36:46.370
These rock walls, again,
with the idea of Quantum energy down here,

36:46.495 --> 36:49.665
that somehow the Quantum energy
had solidified and created these patterns.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.126
And again, when we pull out
into the wider shots,

36:52.210 --> 36:55.880
we're going to have these patterns
running through the landscape,

36:55.963 --> 36:57.798
as well as the actual crops.

36:57.965 --> 37:00.051
(CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING)

37:08.768 --> 37:11.646
Something again that was strongly pushed
throughout this whole show

37:11.729 --> 37:13.898
is trying to create
really interesting compositions.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.026
This idea of the sphere
and concentric spheres,

37:17.443 --> 37:18.736
and here we have Janet's homestead,

37:18.819 --> 37:21.614
which is a series
of concentric spheres in itself.

37:21.697 --> 37:27.203
And in many ways, this room is
a precursor to Kang's Celestium as well.

37:27.286 --> 37:31.624
Those little design ideas
that were developed out from this idea

37:31.707 --> 37:33.084
into the Celestium itself.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.920
MAJORS: Whoa!

37:36.504 --> 37:38.714
We are on the Richard Attenborough
Stage at Pinewood,

37:38.798 --> 37:42.510
and this is Kang's Celestium
with his Time Sphere.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.846
It's something that I really wanted
to keep as part of Kang's language,

37:45.930 --> 37:48.599
was this circular or spherical motif.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.143
I looked at a lot of Japanese Kintsugi

37:51.227 --> 37:53.938
in the way that you have
those sort of cracks through rocks,

37:54.021 --> 37:57.024
and you can seal it up
and re-perfect things.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.153
Which is kind of what Kang is doing,
destroying stuff and then rebuilding it

38:01.237 --> 38:02.738
in a fashion that he sees fit.

38:05.866 --> 38:08.661
I built an empire
down here, Janet.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.707
And I'm taking it with me.

38:13.666 --> 38:17.295
HTAY: Again, I really wanted to create
very kind of graphic moments

38:17.378 --> 38:20.756
in terms of composition
and try to give Bill Pope, our DP,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.926
an environment in which
we could actually frame up Kang

38:24.010 --> 38:26.595
and it almost looked like panels
from comic book or graphic novel.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.657
a sort of barbarian type
warrior character for this movie.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.785
That felt like something
that we really hadn't seen so much.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.204
You see a little in Thor,
you know, with Valkyrie,

38:52.330 --> 38:54.665
but somebody who really felt like

38:54.749 --> 38:57.918
straight out of a Robert E. Howard,
you know, pulp novel.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.421
I had worked with Katy O'Brian
on The Mandalorian

39:00.504 --> 39:01.797
and I thought she was terrific.

39:01.881 --> 39:05.468
She's a bodybuilder and a fighter,
and for real.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.761
(THUDS)

39:06.844 --> 39:10.514
She's got great presence,
and we needed someone that was strong

39:10.598 --> 39:14.852
and could embody that aspect of a leader,
but also the wisdom of a leader.

39:14.935 --> 39:18.230
And Katy makes great impact in that role.

39:18.814 --> 39:22.610
With Jentorra, I really liked the idea
that it was a revolutionary.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.862
It was something different.
It was someone who was

39:24.945 --> 39:26.072
fighting for the greater good,

39:26.155 --> 39:29.283
as opposed to maybe
suppressing the greater good.

39:32.661 --> 39:36.749
I want people to see, you know,
a strong female role in a positive light.

39:36.832 --> 39:39.335
Because this is like
a dream role in a lot of ways. (CHUCKLES)

39:43.339 --> 39:44.340
How?

39:44.423 --> 39:49.011
When it came to the costume, I was
so glad that Sammy, the costume designer,

39:49.095 --> 39:51.597
called me and she was like,
"Hey, have you seen the costume yet?

39:51.722 --> 39:53.891
"Have you seen what we're pitching?"
And I'm like, "No."

39:53.974 --> 39:56.227
She's like, "Okay, I thought
you might want to know

39:57.311 --> 39:58.479
"you're pretty exposed."

39:58.562 --> 40:01.190
And I was like,
"Okay, I'll go to the gym. Thank you."

40:02.274 --> 40:05.027
Jentorra, we were looking
more at a kind of

40:05.111 --> 40:08.197
growth, bone architecture.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.449
And seeing what we could do
with her armor,

40:10.533 --> 40:14.829
to make it more like she's found
a skeleton of a tiny creature

40:14.912 --> 40:16.247
and used that.

40:16.330 --> 40:21.127
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

to the world,

of the world, of the Earth,

of the Quantum Realm.

So, the blue color that we have
kind of meshes in with

40:32.638 --> 40:34.598
things that you might find
in our environment.

40:35.808 --> 40:39.145
Once we added the hair,
makeup, everything, it just clicks.

BROUSSARD: M.O.D.O.K.
was always a character

40:58.539 --> 41:00.624
that we wanted to get into the MCU

41:00.708 --> 41:02.168
somehow, somewhere.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.713
A mechanized organism designed only
for killing.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.382
Now I get it. It's an acronym.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.635
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.556
BROUSSARD: Such an odd design,
a little bit off-putting,

41:15.723 --> 41:17.391
but really great and memorable.

a henchman in this movie?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.609
And we talked about
all these things.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.153
And M.O.D.O.K., if there's ever a context

41:29.278 --> 41:31.864
for M.O.D.O.K. to succeed
in live action in the MCU,

41:31.947 --> 41:33.199
it feels like the Quantum Realm.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.075
And it hit me

41:35.910 --> 41:38.913
like the loudest bell I've ever heard.
Like, "Wait a second."

41:39.622 --> 41:44.335
"What if we have Darren Cross
become M.O.D.O.K.?"

41:44.418 --> 41:45.419
Hi, Hank.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.770
at the end in his super suit.

And I was like, "Okay, great."

Then we went back for reshoots
and nobody told me anything.

and this is, you know, uh...

42:13.739 --> 42:18.035
Darren becomes like
a tiny little ball of red goo.

I was like,
"Oh, can't really come back from that."

42:21.497 --> 42:23.457
And then there was another iteration

42:23.541 --> 42:28.045
where he just sort of shrinks infinitely
into a little dot.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.592
And I said, "Okay,
that's survivable in this world."

been hurt very bad.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.763
He would've been disfigured
by this accident.

You think you're so smart.

43:52.129 --> 43:55.299
Scott Lang, the man
who took everything from me.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.843
Who stole my whole life.

43:57.926 --> 44:02.348
STOLL: And the filming technique
they were using...

44:02.431 --> 44:05.643
It could go one way,
It could be like a real pain,

44:05.726 --> 44:08.729
with dots on your face
and you have this camera

44:08.896 --> 44:10.731
and you don't know
what you're going to look like

44:10.856 --> 44:14.443
and it was so incredibly satisfying.

44:14.526 --> 44:19.281
It's, in some ways,
I feel like the ideal way to act.

44:19.365 --> 44:23.077
Because you're not waiting
for any technology,

44:23.160 --> 44:26.914
even though the whole performance
is so based on technology.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.749
You're not waiting for lights, for camera.

44:28.832 --> 44:30.042
You're not waiting for sound.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.044
You're not waiting
for hair and makeup even.

44:33.087 --> 44:37.800
You know, you're just...
It was just me and the rest of the cast

44:37.883 --> 44:40.052
in this open space.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.721
It felt like a really cool play rehearsal,

44:42.805 --> 44:45.974
except that all this rehearsal
is being captured

44:46.183 --> 44:50.104
as data that can be turned
into this performance.

44:51.230 --> 44:54.274
You always were
a brother to me.

44:56.735 --> 44:57.736
I was?

45:05.494 --> 45:06.829
I was.

45:06.912 --> 45:08.914
And at least I died

45:10.207 --> 45:11.417
an Avenger.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.088
Yeah.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.674
-You did.
-Yeah. No, it's...

45:18.757 --> 45:20.259
-You're in.
-(DARREN SIGHS IN RELIEF)

45:21.719 --> 45:24.346
We really liked making an Ant-Man film

45:24.430 --> 45:28.016
as important, as integral
to the MCU going forward

45:28.100 --> 45:29.601
as any other film.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.605
REED: I think that's an important beat.
As you step out of that thing

45:33.689 --> 45:35.441
and land here, that looking to her,

45:35.524 --> 45:38.360
you know, taking your time with that
before you then turn to this...

45:38.444 --> 45:39.820
-I do?
-REED: Yeah.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.739
BROUSSARD: It's teeing up
Kang in a very big way.

45:41.822 --> 45:47.077
It's teeing up the future of this
very fearsome, very formidable foe

45:47.161 --> 45:48.454
within the MCU.

45:50.998 --> 45:54.042
It's going to help show us
where the MCU is going next.

45:56.378 --> 46:01.467
But I love that we're getting to make
a trilogy out of Ant-Man. (CHUCKLES)

46:01.925 --> 46:02.968
And, shrink!

46:06.597 --> 46:08.766
Yeah, back to one.
Let's try one more right away, guys.

46:08.849 --> 46:09.850
That's great.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.895
BROUSSARD: The fact that
not only he gets a trilogy,

46:13.228 --> 46:15.189
but that Peyton will have
directed all three films,

46:15.272 --> 46:19.109
that Peyton has seen the trilogy home
is so exciting to me.

46:20.652 --> 46:24.782
PFEIFFER: I've loved working with Peyton.
I feel lucky

46:24.865 --> 46:27.451
that I've had someone like him

46:27.534 --> 46:30.537
to kind of guide me.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.581
(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

REED: Shockwave that comes out
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

46:39.213 --> 46:41.507
and just take you out of frame there.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.510
We'll do a separate shot of a second thing
which is like... (GRUNTS)

46:44.593 --> 46:46.386
Coming from that port.

46:47.262 --> 46:50.682
PFEIFFER: To be able to do
the kind of superhero action

46:50.766 --> 46:53.143
and the heart and the humor...

46:53.769 --> 46:55.103
He just gets it.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.731
This is, uh, a day one of, uh, Ant-Man.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.320
I want to thank you all for being here.

47:03.403 --> 47:06.114
I'm so psyched about this movie.
We're going to have a great shoot.

47:06.198 --> 47:08.826
I know a lot of you have been waiting
a very long time to shoot.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.369
And today's the day. Let's do it.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.995
-Thank you so much.
-MAN: Yeah!

47:12.079 --> 47:13.872
(EXHILARATING MUSIC PLAYING)

47:15.666 --> 47:16.750
(ANT-MAN GRUNTS)

47:16.834 --> 47:18.836
REED: I grew up with Superman: The Movie

47:18.919 --> 47:21.380
and Star Wars and Raiders
and all those things.

47:21.463 --> 47:23.966
And I'd always
wanted to do a movie like that.

47:24.049 --> 47:26.009
So, for me, it was really gratifying

47:26.093 --> 47:29.847
because we were able to just paint
on this really large canvas.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.765
-Okay.
-Boom! So you know what to do.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.518
RUDD: Scott Lang has been
really important in my life,

47:34.601 --> 47:37.521
and it really has been
an amazing group of people

47:37.604 --> 47:40.566
I've gotten to spend
a good chunk of time with.

47:40.649 --> 47:44.111
Even in Civil War, I think I had
that scene where we're on the tarmac

47:44.194 --> 47:46.947
and I'm meeting Captain America
for the first time,

47:47.030 --> 47:48.490
and some of the other Avengers.

47:48.574 --> 47:49.950
The whole thing was surreal,

47:50.033 --> 47:52.286
and I felt a little bit like
the character that I was playing.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.704
I still feel that.

47:53.787 --> 47:56.248
I can't believe I'm, I'm on this team.

47:56.832 --> 47:58.542
I've treasured it. I really have.

48:07.050 --> 48:09.052
I know before we ever started
shooting this thing,

48:09.136 --> 48:11.013
I'd tell people, you know, I'm going to...

48:11.096 --> 48:12.890
"What are you working on?"
I'd say, "Ant-Man"

48:13.056 --> 48:14.433
"Ant-Man? What's Ant-Man?"

48:14.558 --> 48:16.351
"It's a Marvel movie."

48:17.394 --> 48:20.647
"Ant-Man?" Because not many people
know the character.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.358
And they'd say, "What are your powers?"

48:23.442 --> 48:24.985
I'd say, "Well, I can shrink."

48:25.694 --> 48:27.279
They'd say, "Okay."

48:27.362 --> 48:30.157
"But I can also talk to ants."
