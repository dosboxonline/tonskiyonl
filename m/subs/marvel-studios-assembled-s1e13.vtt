WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:08.550
I'd been trying to get my dirty,
little fingers into Marvel for years,

00:08.675 --> 00:12.137
<i>so I go in, I meet with Brad Winderbaum</i>
<i>for the</i> Black Widow <i>movie.</i>

00:12.220 --> 00:17.767
<i>I loved She-Hulk so much even then,</i>
<i>that I put her into my</i> Black Widow <i>pitch.</i>

00:17.851 --> 00:19.352
<i>At one point, he even said like,</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:23.023
"Kinda feels like you're pitching
a She-Hulk story with Black Widow in it,"

00:23.106 --> 00:24.274
and I said, "Guilty."

00:24.399 --> 00:27.986
<i>So, when I didn't get that job,</i>
<i>my parting shot to them was,</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:31.823
"If you ever do do She-Hulk,
you better call me, because if you don't,

00:31.906 --> 00:33.825
"I'll burn this building to the ground."

00:33.908 --> 00:36.411
<i>Kevin makes the announcement</i>
<i>that they're gonna do</i> She-Hulk

00:36.494 --> 00:38.580
as a series and I'm furious,

00:38.663 --> 00:40.206
because I look at my phone, I'm like,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.417
"I don't have any missed calls
from Marvel Studios.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.918
"I told them what would happen."

00:44.002 --> 00:46.963
<i>And my fianc√© was, of course, like,</i>
<i>"Chill out, dude."</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:49.257
<i>And then literally the next day,</i>
<i>I got a call,</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:51.885
you know, from Marvel to see
if I wanted to pitch on She-Hulk

00:51.968 --> 00:53.094
and of course I was like,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.638
"I think I heard something
about an announcement?"

01:04.773 --> 01:08.276
I was actually a huge fan
of She-Hulk as a kid.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.070
<i>She was, kind of, in my mind,</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:14.407
<i>the only really badass female superhero</i>
<i>who had her own comic books.</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:19.329
WENDY JACOBSON: <i>In her actual pitch</i>
<i>to get hired,</i>

01:19.454 --> 01:21.039
Kat had a picture of her

01:21.122 --> 01:22.791
as a "scrawny teenager,"

01:22.874 --> 01:24.876
<i>you know, reading the She-Hulk comic.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:26.753
<i>She used to go every week and get it,</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:29.422
and it was this exciting,
formative thing.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.175
COIRO: <i>It was right as everything</i>
<i>was going down with the pandemic,</i>

01:32.258 --> 01:36.096
I had my first meeting, and it was,
kind of, you know, horrible for the world,

01:36.179 --> 01:39.265
but great timing,
because my husband, Rhys,

01:39.349 --> 01:41.059
<i>actually owned all the old comics,</i>

01:41.142 --> 01:44.521
<i>and we went to his mom's basement</i>
<i>and pulled them up,</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:48.233
<i>and I got to, kind of, go back through</i>
<i>all these comics that I'd loved,</i>

01:48.316 --> 01:51.611
and really remember
what was so exciting about She-Hulk.

01:51.694 --> 01:55.323
<i>And what was so exciting about her</i>
<i>is that she broke the fourth wall,</i>

01:55.406 --> 02:00.161
<i>and she was so irreverent,</i>
<i>and she was so big, and strong, and bold,</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:04.541
and so many of the things that
she did are, kind of, groundbreaking.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.423
ANU VALIA: <i>What I love about Jen's</i>
<i>story is, she's this young woman</i>

02:12.507 --> 02:15.009
who spent so much time working,

02:15.176 --> 02:18.680
and hasn't really had the chance
to grow her life romantically,

02:18.763 --> 02:20.390
<i>to spend time with her friends,</i>

02:20.473 --> 02:25.061
<i>to just, like, live a fun life</i>
<i>as a young adult woman, and then,</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:27.313
<i>this huge thing happens to her</i>
<i>and it's like,</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:30.984
<i>how do you, sort of,</i>
<i>navigate just your everyday life,</i>

02:31.067 --> 02:33.611
<i>trying to be good at your job,</i>
<i>trying to be a good friend,</i>

02:33.736 --> 02:37.615
trying to figure out, sort of,
what you want as a person,

02:37.699 --> 02:40.076
and then as a Hulk.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.371
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna be a superhero.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.415
(CHUCKLES)

02:45.748 --> 02:47.500
BANNER: What else ya gonna do as a Hulk?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.296
Return to my career.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.007
What I love most about Jen,
Jen/She-Hulk

02:54.465 --> 02:56.176
<i>is just her contradiction.</i>

02:56.259 --> 03:02.807
<i>She's just so completely fixated on work,</i>
<i>and yet she also has this huge heart,</i>

03:02.891 --> 03:05.393
<i>and just wants to fall in love,</i>
<i>and all of that.</i>

03:05.476 --> 03:07.979
<i>And also that she, in one sense,</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:11.566
<i>loves being She-Hulk</i>
<i>and at the same time resents it.</i>

03:11.649 --> 03:15.904
She's kind of
directly in that contradiction.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.324
We just started a superhuman law division,

03:19.407 --> 03:22.702
and I want you, well, the She-Hulk,
to be the face of it.

03:22.785 --> 03:23.786
Oh.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.164
JACOBSON: <i>There was conversation</i>
<i>even in the methodology</i>

03:26.247 --> 03:27.457
<i>about how we shoot this.</i>

03:27.582 --> 03:28.875
<i>At one point, we talked about,</i>

03:28.958 --> 03:31.920
are we gonna go old school
and do it like Bill Bixby,

03:32.003 --> 03:33.671
and, and Lou Ferrigno, and find

03:33.755 --> 03:36.174
you know, a great actor
who's of a certain height,

03:36.257 --> 03:39.677
and then have a bodybuilder
playing She-Hulk.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.554
<i>There were so many</i>
<i>different discussions,</i>

03:41.679 --> 03:44.515
<i>we went down so many different paths,</i>
<i>and at the end of the day,</i>

03:44.599 --> 03:48.061
<i>it really landed with, "We need to find</i>
<i>the best actor for this job</i>

03:48.144 --> 03:51.231
<i>"who's gonna bring the most to the role,"</i>
<i>because ultimately,</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:55.902
<i>she's going to be a six-foot-seven,</i>
<i>green computer-generated image,</i>

03:55.985 --> 03:59.239
<i>and we all need to feel like</i>
<i>this is a real human being,</i>

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
<i>and buy what she's selling.</i>

04:01.866 --> 04:04.911
These dodos never had to deal
with this on the first day of the job.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.996
I hope they die in a fire.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.291
Not really, they can die of old age,
but like, tomorrow.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.379
GAO: <i>I always thought of this</i>
<i>as a comedic role,</i>

04:14.462 --> 04:17.173
and so I always thought like
we need a very comedic actress.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.425
You know, has to be a very,
very comedic person,

04:19.509 --> 04:22.345
who has a ton of comedy experience,

04:22.428 --> 04:25.223
<i>but when we cast Tatiana, it was like,</i>

04:25.306 --> 04:29.018
<i>she made me change the way</i>
<i>I think about this character.</i>

04:29.227 --> 04:31.938
<i>Like, she turned Jennifer Walters</i>
<i>and She-Hulk into a real person.</i>

04:32.021 --> 04:35.149
I'm a Hulk.
Why don't I just smash our way in?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.818
Because they have weapons, Jennifer.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.029
(WHISPERS) Yeah, well, good thing
She-Hulk is indestructible, Matthew.

04:40.154 --> 04:43.533
Not only am I, like, stepping into, like,
being a superhero for the first time,

04:43.616 --> 04:46.286
but I'm also, like getting to do
a flat-out comedy,

04:46.369 --> 04:47.912
<i>which is just so exciting.</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:51.124
<i>And like with, you know,</i>
<i>writing like Jessica's,</i>

04:51.207 --> 04:55.461
<i>it's just so easy, and all of our</i>
<i>day players are like amazing,</i>

04:55.545 --> 04:58.840
<i>all of the guest stars, like,</i>
<i>it's just an incredible group of people,</i>

04:58.923 --> 05:04.178
<i>so it just feels really,</i>
<i>for the first time, like, total play, um,</i>

05:04.262 --> 05:06.889
which I've experienced in little doses,

05:06.973 --> 05:09.392
but this feels like
totally a different world.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.979
Who are the two least likely people
to play Hulk?

05:13.187 --> 05:16.190
She's actually hysterical.

05:16.274 --> 05:20.611
-Well, I disagree, but I'm having fun.
-You're really funny.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.741
-You can do comedy really well.
-This guy's the fun one.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.576
I... I have never had the chance.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.246
I know, isn't it...
Don't you feel like, as a serious actor,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.874
<i>you get stuck doing serious things,</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:35.501
<i>-when all you really wanna do is comedy?</i>
-MASLANY: <i>Yeah.</i>

05:35.710 --> 05:38.379
-What?
-Don't make me angry.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.840
You wouldn't like as me...

05:41.007 --> 05:42.759
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:46.429 --> 05:48.389
SHANNON JUSTISON: <i>For She-Hulk</i>
<i>we were really keen</i>

05:48.514 --> 05:50.099
<i>on it being Tatiana's performance.</i>

05:50.183 --> 05:52.477
Our whole goal was to
not keyframe her face.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.937
<i>She's amazing.</i>
<i>You want all that performance.</i>

05:55.063 --> 05:58.149
<i>And, so, she was wearing</i>
<i>of course the full mo-cap suit</i>

05:58.232 --> 06:00.485
<i>which gets her physical,</i>
<i>her body performance,</i>

06:00.568 --> 06:03.738
<i>and then she had what we call an HMC</i>
<i>or a head mounted camera on.</i>

06:03.821 --> 06:05.907
<i>And it's recording all those little dots</i>

06:05.990 --> 06:10.411
and then those dots are then piped into
a system that can then read that in

06:10.536 --> 06:12.955
and translate that into facial motion.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.833
MAN: Scrunch your face left.
Scrunch your face right.

06:15.917 --> 06:20.046
Blink. Blink right. Blink left. Good.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.215
JUSTISON: <i>So the gold standard</i>
<i>for motion capture</i>

06:22.298 --> 06:23.883
<i>is what we call optical capture,</i>

06:23.966 --> 06:26.844
that's what you would probably recognize
as having the little like,

06:26.928 --> 06:28.429
what looks like ping-pong balls,

06:28.513 --> 06:32.100
<i>what we call retro reflective markers</i>
<i>all over at certain points on the body.</i>

06:32.183 --> 06:35.228
<i>It also requires about 50 cameras</i>
<i>set up in a volume,</i>

06:35.311 --> 06:38.314
<i>and those all have to be perfectly set up</i>
<i>and then calibrated,</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:40.983
obviously there's a big up time
with hanging all those cameras,

06:41.067 --> 06:43.361
and then any scenes
where there's a lot of crowds,

06:43.444 --> 06:45.947
<i>she's sitting at her desk,</i>
<i>suddenly her legs are blocked,</i>

06:46.030 --> 06:47.490
<i>we can't see her pelvis anymore.</i>

06:47.573 --> 06:50.618
<i>That's when we would use an inertial suit.</i>

06:50.743 --> 06:55.164
<i>Inertial suits, they rely on little</i>
<i>sensors that are built into the suit,</i>

06:55.331 --> 06:57.917
that also is just on a signal.

06:58.334 --> 07:02.463
So there's a little station that we set up
and it talks to all of the sensors.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.257
The only tricky thing with that,

07:04.340 --> 07:06.551
it's not as precise
as the optical capture.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.886
<i>So the inertial</i>
<i>tended to go with us on location,</i>

07:08.970 --> 07:10.680
<i>for quick setup and tear down,</i>

07:10.763 --> 07:14.308
<i>optical any time we were in a big set,</i>
<i>we were gonna be there for a few days.</i>

07:14.392 --> 07:16.561
We did everything. We did mo-cap,

07:16.644 --> 07:17.770
<i>we did facial capture,</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:20.356
<i>we did Tatiana doing all the takes</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:23.484
<i>as well as doing a stunt double</i>
<i>doing the takes as well as</i>

07:23.568 --> 07:27.071
<i>animation trying to track</i>
<i>the motion capture.</i>

07:27.155 --> 07:29.323
<i>Tatiana has her frame,</i>

07:29.407 --> 07:31.784
and it's quite different
to what She-Hulk is,

07:31.868 --> 07:34.370
so Tatiana doing this is one thing.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.539
When you have She-Hulk, it feels this!

07:36.622 --> 07:39.709
And people don't talk this way!
But that's how it translates

07:39.792 --> 07:43.004
when you are the height that she is
and the size that she is.

07:43.087 --> 07:47.884
<i>So we had to do a lot of,</i>
<i>maybe, taming</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:51.429
<i>the straight translation from what</i>
<i>Tatiana did to She-Hulk,</i>

07:51.512 --> 07:54.182
<i>so that it would feel within character,</i>

07:54.265 --> 07:56.309
and it didn't become a caricature.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.187
JUSTISON: <i>Someone like She-Hulk</i>
<i>is very time intensive.</i>

07:59.353 --> 08:03.483
<i>She also has additional complications</i>
<i>in that she's got long-flowing hair,</i>

08:03.566 --> 08:07.069
so she's automatically more difficult
than other characters.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.198
She also has 25 costumes,
which is unheard of.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.409
<i>We only started from a core</i>
<i>from the wardrobe department</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:15.870
<i>and then we would kinda</i>
<i>take it from there.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:20.625
<i>For the show, we also had an actress,</i>
<i>Malia, who was 6'7,</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:23.920
<i>and so she would wear</i>
<i>a practical version of the costume</i>

08:24.003 --> 08:26.631
<i>and that was really valuable reference</i>
<i>for us in visual effects.</i>

08:26.714 --> 08:29.217
That was one of the funnest things
about this character,

08:29.342 --> 08:33.095
was getting to do both versions
of these costumes,

08:33.179 --> 08:38.935
<i>what they look like on Tatiana, as Jen,</i>
<i>and then as She-Hulk.</i>

08:39.060 --> 08:41.562
We actually had a body form made,

08:41.646 --> 08:45.066
based off of what She-Hulk's
measurements would have been,

08:45.149 --> 08:47.485
and we had that as a reference

08:47.568 --> 08:50.279
<i>when we were making those costumes,</i>
<i>so that we could see,</i>

08:50.363 --> 08:53.866
<i>like the aftermath of the suit</i>
<i>after she has her transformation.</i>

08:53.991 --> 08:59.455
We studied a lot of different
transformations on camera.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.499
There's so many different ways to do it.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.043
<i>And the truth is,</i>
<i>with Jennifer turning into She-Hulk,</i>

09:04.126 --> 09:07.338
<i>it's meant to be this very seamless,</i>
<i>natural, easy thing.</i>

09:07.421 --> 09:10.675
Yeah. All the way down, small, impish.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.803
One of the things that we really
responded to in visual effects

09:13.886 --> 09:16.097
was pulling up this reference material.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.892
<i>There was a time lapse video</i>
<i>of a strawberry ripening,</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:22.895
<i>and that was kind of,</i>
<i>the biggest inspiration.</i>

09:22.979 --> 09:25.815
-See?
-No, I'm doing this.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.401
Okay, this is completely new territory.

09:30.695 --> 09:36.158
We are in studio.
We're doing the scenes where,

09:36.242 --> 09:39.495
Jen has been cousin-napped by Bruce,

09:39.579 --> 09:42.206
<i>and taken back to his beach lab,</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:45.918
<i>and she is undergoing,</i>
<i>like, Hulk training.</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:48.462
Oh, my God, Bruce, what the hell?

09:48.546 --> 09:51.215
It kind of feels like if
I don't transform, I'm gonna die!

09:51.299 --> 09:53.009
Learning to be a Hulk,

09:53.092 --> 09:56.596
how to eat like a Hulk,
how to dress as a Hulk,

09:56.804 --> 10:00.016
how to control her transformations,

10:00.099 --> 10:04.562
but what's so cool about it is that
she's pretty great at controlling them.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.355
Far better than Bruce is.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.649
The triggers are anger and fear.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.443
Oh. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

10:10.526 --> 10:13.863
Those are, like, the baseline
of any woman just existing.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.700
A lot comes more easily to her
than it did for him.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.745
<i>It's a little frustrating,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

10:20.828 --> 10:22.830
Guess we could just...

10:23.372 --> 10:24.582
skip all that then.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.585
<i>You know, he wants to be her mentor.</i>

10:27.877 --> 10:29.629
<i>I mean, there is no other person</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:31.964
<i>in the universe who's sort of,</i>

10:32.048 --> 10:33.799
<i>gone through what he's gone through,</i>

10:33.883 --> 10:36.594
and so I think he's so excited

10:36.677 --> 10:40.473
to have this other person
to lay all this on, and...

10:40.556 --> 10:42.516
But she's so far ahead of him.

10:42.642 --> 10:48.022
-Fine. Teach me how to Hulk.
-Yes! I mean, okay.

10:51.984 --> 10:56.322
Mark's amazing.
He's so, playful, and, like, open,

10:56.405 --> 10:59.200
'cause I imagine it must be a weird thing

10:59.283 --> 11:01.994
to be taking this character
that you've known for years,

11:02.078 --> 11:05.498
that you've explored in certain contexts,

11:05.581 --> 11:08.709
but then to take him out of that context,
and put him in, like,

11:08.793 --> 11:11.504
<i>this very different tone</i>
<i>in this very different world.</i>

11:11.587 --> 11:13.506
<i>It's just really fun to see him, like,</i>

11:13.589 --> 11:15.758
<i>explore that character</i>
<i>in a totally different way.</i>

11:15.883 --> 11:17.426
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

11:17.510 --> 11:19.845
RUFFALO: <i>I've been doing this</i>
<i>for almost 10 years now,</i>

11:19.929 --> 11:23.349
<i>and I think we've done a really good job</i>
<i>of switching it up,</i>

11:23.432 --> 11:28.270
<i>and taking the characters, both Banner</i>
<i>and Hulk to a lot of different places.</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:31.899
<i>So, it's definitely</i>
<i>kept it interesting for me,</i>

11:31.982 --> 11:36.320
and this is a whole other, like...
Really playing long scenes,

11:36.404 --> 11:39.490
and playing with another person,

11:39.573 --> 11:42.451
who is in motion capture,
I haven't really gotten to do.

11:42.576 --> 11:48.165
There's that one time that I was stuck as
the other guy for over two years.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.711
-That was on another planet.
-No, I can't be this for two years.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.131
No, I was in space! I said one time!

11:55.214 --> 11:59.176
Whoa. You have so much to learn
about living as a Hulk.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.013
I think Jessica and all the writers
just nailed it,

12:03.097 --> 12:08.394
in terms of it's so specific.
It's such a, like, sibling relationship.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.895
-Smug-Hulk.
-Smart-Hulk.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.440
Well, it's pretty smug
to call yourself smart.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.358
Yeah, I didn't come up with it.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.820
There's very little listening happening
and a lot of explaining. (LAUGHS)

12:17.903 --> 12:20.281
And a lot of telling the other what's up.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.869
-Come on, Bruce! Let me out.
-Put the helmet back on!

12:24.994 --> 12:28.038
MASLANY: <i>It feels really innate,</i>
<i>and it was, kind of,</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:31.125
<i>a natural place for Mark and I to go,</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

12:31.208 --> 12:34.253
-Are you wearing fake eyelashes?
-No, what are we talking about?

12:34.378 --> 12:35.421
This is totally natural.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.632
-It's been amazingly fun.
-It's been so much fun. It's...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.885
-It's been a great time.
-The dumbest time.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.553
-It's dumb fun.
-It's dumb, yeah.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.054
Which is the best kind of fun.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.390
No, the hard time during the good time.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.769
-There's a good time during a hard time.
-There's a good time during hard time.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.854
-Darn it, I had it right the first time.
-Okay.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.609
JASON TAMEZ: <i>The art department</i>
<i>designed these fabulous sets.</i>

12:56.692 --> 13:00.070
It put us on the beach,
and we created the exterior

13:00.196 --> 13:03.491
<i>on a back lot pad</i>
<i>against blue screen here.</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:07.411
<i>Built the tiki bar, and part of his</i>

this fight between Hulk and She-Hulk.

-Lunkhead!
-Dummy!

RUFFALO: <i>We got to do all our own stunts.</i>

13:16.796 --> 13:18.297
I mean, we got to do

13:18.464 --> 13:20.674
-our big stunt fight scene together.
-Yeah.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.093
-(SCREAMS)
-(GRUNTS)

13:23.219 --> 13:27.014
We did these drills where they were,
like, competing throwing boulders,

13:27.097 --> 13:28.307
and she's winning,

13:28.390 --> 13:30.851
and it was one of my
favorite moments of the whole shoot

13:30.935 --> 13:33.354
<i>where they just, kind of,</i>
<i>went crazy and let loose.</i>

13:33.437 --> 13:35.898
My bar!

13:36.023 --> 13:37.608
MASLANY: <i>What else?</i>
<i>We did ground-pounding.</i>

13:37.691 --> 13:42.279
-We did Hulk-leaping, we did some pushes.
-You shoved me.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.949
-We did coconut...
-We did coconut time.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.786
<i>Oh, yeah, and I nailed you</i>
<i>in the face every time.</i>

13:48.869 --> 13:52.957
Ten guys all missed me and the only one
that was our dead ringer was her,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.166
<i>every single time.</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:57.044
(GROANS AND GRUNTS)

13:57.211 --> 13:58.546
MAN: Action!

13:58.671 --> 14:01.340
Jen, people wanna know
everything about you.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.468
You're a public figure now.
And I'm famous adjacent. Yes!

14:04.552 --> 14:06.679
One of the first people
I thought of for this

14:06.762 --> 14:08.806
after Tatiana was cast was Ginger.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.559
<i>And they're about the same age,</i>
<i>and that was important to me,</i>

14:11.684 --> 14:14.812
<i>that they be peers, and be real friends.</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:18.649
<i>They're not just work friends,</i>
<i>they are people who relate on every level.</i>

14:18.816 --> 14:20.401
Thinking you're gonna be an Avenger.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.696
Gettin' Captain America. Making sure
he's done the deed before

14:23.779 --> 14:25.698
-so he knows how to help you.
-Bye. Bye.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.658
This was the one role, actually,

14:27.741 --> 14:29.702
that we did setup chemistry tests for,

14:29.785 --> 14:32.371
<i>because their relationship, you know,</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:35.457
<i>is like one of the core dramatic things</i>
<i>that the show is riding on.</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:37.376
<i>If you don't believe their friendship,</i>

14:37.459 --> 14:39.253
<i>then nothing else is really gonna work.</i>

14:39.336 --> 14:40.963
-We did a scene where...
-Yes!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.339
-This is the gala scene.
-Yeah.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.341
<i>And me and Ginger walked in...</i>

14:44.425 --> 14:46.719
GINGER GONZAGA: <i>To cool music,</i>
<i>like, we chose the song.</i>

14:46.802 --> 14:48.971
-MASLANY: <i>We did a whole thing.</i>
<i>-We were serving it.</i>

14:49.054 --> 14:51.891
MASLANY: <i>Then Kat, in the notes she gave</i>
<i>after the take, was like,</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:55.060
"Could you guys just do it, like, cool?

14:55.144 --> 14:57.855
-"You know, make it look cool?"
-Yeah, and we died, because

14:58.063 --> 14:59.773
we had been serving our best cool,

14:59.857 --> 15:04.111
<i>and we thought we had been freakin' cool,</i>

15:04.194 --> 15:06.655
so I literally
didn't know what I could give.

15:11.452 --> 15:15.956
Ginger's brain works faster
than anybody's brain on the planet,

15:16.040 --> 15:17.917
especially mine.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.502
She's just, like,
the sharpest person I've ever met.

15:20.586 --> 15:25.549
<i>She can improvise so, like,</i>
<i>seamlessly, effortlessly.</i>

15:25.633 --> 15:27.343
<i>She's just, like, always in flow.</i>

15:27.426 --> 15:30.471
If things go bad, we're gonna have
five people for Mahjong!

15:30.554 --> 15:32.181
-Yes!
-What's that?

15:32.306 --> 15:35.017
It's a tile game, we'll have to go
and get the Chinese tiles...

15:35.100 --> 15:36.477
That sounds like more my style.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.854
I would rather that
than five guys at the same time.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.689
Then add it to your profile, girl.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.317
I'm lucky that they support me

15:43.525 --> 15:46.779
and I get a lot of freedom to play around
and use my brain.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.657
Improvising's my favorite thing to do.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.159
So, I'm like so grateful
that they let me "go rogue."

15:52.242 --> 15:54.995
That's the guy who says,
"You don't need to wear any make up".

15:55.079 --> 15:57.414
That guy was born
wearing that pinkie ring.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.584
That guy was wearing sunglasses inside.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.086
Teal ones that matched

16:02.169 --> 16:04.213
-the color of his shirt.
-Yeah.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.048
-I need a favor.
-Okay.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.009
Will you stand in line with me
waiting for a sneaker drop?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.886
The Iron Man Threes are comin' out,

16:10.970 --> 16:12.846
and they're limited
to one pair per customer.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.390
Why do you need two pairs?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.058
One to rock and one to stock.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.269
GONZAGA: <i>I love the Pug-Nikki dynamic.</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:23.899
Pug is just so sincere, just as Josh is
in life, and, like, really amped.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.236
<i>And he is just there to be a ride or die</i>
<i>for his two gal pals.</i>

16:27.319 --> 16:30.155
That was everything
that I wanted it to be.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.783
It's a crazy feeling knowing
that you're working at Marvel,

16:32.866 --> 16:35.703
and you're working, and you're getting to
bring characters to life

16:35.786 --> 16:37.413
<i>that are in comic canon.</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:41.333
Bringing Pug to the screen, and just,
kind of, gettin' to see what this world

16:41.417 --> 16:44.628
looks like in this MCU law world,

16:44.753 --> 16:46.797
I'm pretty stoked to be a part of it, bro.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.801
<i>I think I chose the right law firm.</i>
<i>I'm a lucky cat that they chose me back.</i>

16:50.884 --> 16:52.386
I made you guys a welcome basket.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.887
-Oh!
-(CHUCKLES)

16:53.971 --> 16:56.015
It's got some office supplies
to get you started,

16:56.098 --> 17:00.686
snacks, and a map to
the best bathroom for pooping.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.062
Thank you.

17:02.187 --> 17:06.650
I think it's important to, sort of,
capture the workplace dynamics.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.570
So, you know we have this beautiful place
that she works in,

17:09.653 --> 17:10.946
and it can be intimidating.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.991
But like, at the heart of it,
what are sort of the same

17:14.074 --> 17:17.369
workplace dynamics that people
are used to, which is there's the boss

17:17.453 --> 17:20.414
<i>who you're trying to impress</i>
<i>but you also, like,</i>

17:20.497 --> 17:23.375
<i>can't really read them.</i>
<i>And they know that.</i>

17:23.459 --> 17:26.170
<i>There's like the friends you work with,</i>
<i>and you're navigating</i>

17:26.253 --> 17:29.214
<i>the friendship relationship,</i>
<i>even though that person works for you.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:31.759
<i>There's the co-worker that</i>
<i>you wanna be friends with</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:33.927
<i>but is cool and you don't know</i>
<i>when you're in.</i>

17:34.011 --> 17:35.054
There's a lot going on.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.849
(SIGHS) How does she always look
so impeccable? Where does she shop?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.517
Somewhere with valet parking.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.605
REN√âE GOLDSBERRY: <i>Mallory Book is the face</i>
<i>that never lost a case,</i>

17:44.730 --> 17:48.317
which is a daunting thing to play.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.736
<i>Most importantly,</i>
<i>she's really good at her job.</i>

17:50.819 --> 17:54.323
<i>I think of her as a superhero</i>
<i>in the court.</i>

17:54.823 --> 17:56.366
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.119
As you will see,
there are no issues of fact here

17:59.203 --> 18:01.288
that would require proceeding to trial.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.248
When I found out she was playing Mallory,

18:03.332 --> 18:05.167
I was like, losing my mind,
I was so excited.

18:05.292 --> 18:08.128
<i>And then when I got to</i>
<i>actually work with her,</i>

18:08.212 --> 18:11.548
<i>and see the nuance that</i>
<i>she brings to Mallory, you know,</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:15.636
<i>Mallory is written as this, sort of, like,</i>
<i>icy, untouchable person.</i>

18:15.719 --> 18:21.266
But Ren√©e just, like, so smartly ties in
these beautiful human moments.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.394
As you can see in the "About me" section,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.355
my client wrote, and I quote,

18:26.438 --> 18:29.733
"Mean, green and straight poured
into these jeans."

18:29.900 --> 18:30.901
Ew.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.616
I'm serious and I'm pissed.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.578
GAO: <i>In the comics, you know,</i>
<i>Titania is another super-powered woman,</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:43.497
<i>but not as powerful as She-Hulk.</i>

18:43.580 --> 18:47.042
<i>And she's just laser-focused on</i>
<i>taking down She-Hulk out of,</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:49.378
<i>you know,</i>
<i>the implication is out of jealousy.</i>

18:49.503 --> 18:53.340
We wanted to give her a little bit more
complexity but also modernize her.

18:53.507 --> 18:57.886
<i>And if there was a female</i>
<i>super-powered villain today,</i>

18:57.970 --> 18:59.638
<i>for sure she would be on social media.</i>

18:59.763 --> 19:01.473
Could you take a photo of us?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.100
-Oh, my god, yes.
-No.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.519
Back up a little bit.
Just give me some space.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.729
And the great thing about Jameela is

19:07.813 --> 19:11.900
she understands
that type of personality to a tee.

19:11.984 --> 19:16.029
Try telling that to the thousands of
testimonials from my fans

19:16.113 --> 19:18.073
who have had amazing results

19:18.157 --> 19:21.743

of She-Hulk foot exfoliants,

I have a free sample of,

19:23.787 --> 19:25.581

JAMEELA JAMIL: <i>I thought I was</i>
<i>going to be playing someone</i>

19:34.214 --> 19:37.009
who poisons people,
because those were the sides that I read.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.719
They don't tell you
anything at Marvel.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.554
'Cause they're very,
very secretive.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.390
Uh, and so I didn't know
I would be doing any stunts,

19:43.473 --> 19:45.225
until I'd already signed the contract.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.270
And so I get to Atlanta thinking
I'm gonna have a very chill time.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.898
And they were like,
"Welcome to six months of stunts."

19:53.775 --> 19:59.323
I'm so strong now. This is, like, 45 tons,
that I'm actually lifting right now.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.451
And it's just, like, so easy...
Easy for me.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.411
I was really afraid.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.538
Because she had called me and she'd said,

20:06.622 --> 20:08.332
"I've never worked out a day in my life.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.585
"I've never done a fight
a day in my life." And I was just like,

20:11.668 --> 20:13.170
"Oh, no. What's gonna happen?"

20:13.253 --> 20:16.757
<i>And then when she showed up,</i>
<i>she was so flexible. I was like,</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:19.468
<i>"Okay, we can work with that.</i>
<i>Let's have you do some kicks."</i>

20:19.551 --> 20:21.970
She likes spinning. I was like,
"Your character spins.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.933
<i>"You know you do a kick</i>
<i>and you spin into another fight."</i>

20:26.099 --> 20:28.644
She's all about the hair and the makeup
and the clothes.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.479
But still. She came to win.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.398
You see that?
That was five months of training.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.859
So, you are welcome.

VALIA: <i>The wedding episode came from</i>
<i>the beautiful mind of Jessica Gao.</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:42.407
It was very much based on her life.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.618
Couples massage in ten minutes.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.871
Jen. I was gonna book you one,
and then I was like,

20:48.163 --> 20:51.166
"Wait, Lulu, what are you thinking?
Jen isn't in a couple."

20:51.291 --> 20:52.793
You know, it's your classic.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.672
<i>You gotta go back home to your</i>
<i>old childhood friend's wedding.</i>

20:56.797 --> 20:59.299
<i>And they're kind of a nightmare person.</i>

20:59.383 --> 21:01.551
I don't want you to be a Hulk
at my wedding.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.470
Let me have my day, Jen.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.307
Lulu is played by Patti Harrison,
who's a star.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.185
Hi. Hi, Jen. Hi!

21:10.269 --> 21:13.981
HARRISON: <i>Lulu is a high school</i>
<i>friend of Jen's.</i>

21:14.106 --> 21:19.152
I definitely went to high school
with girls like that.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.406
And they exist.
And they have every right to exist.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.159
But, that doesn't mean that

21:26.243 --> 21:29.037
<i>they don't make existence harder</i>
<i>for everyone else around.</i>

21:29.162 --> 21:31.540
How could you do this to me
on my wedding day?

21:31.623 --> 21:32.749
Now everything's ruined!

21:32.833 --> 21:35.127
I always thought
if I would meet her in real life,

21:35.210 --> 21:37.504
I'd be like, too intimidated to talk.
And I was.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.591
<i>But, I got all, like,</i>
<i>the fangirling out early</i>

21:41.675 --> 21:45.220
<i>and, just, like,</i>
<i>have loved working with her.</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:49.099
Tatiana is a real-life monster.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.811
She's one of the most toxic people
I've ever worked with in my life.

21:53.145 --> 21:58.025
Um... I love her to death
and I would kill for her.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.860
And I would kill anyone she told me to.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.779
She-Hulk is at my wedding?

22:03.613 --> 22:06.116
I love you.

22:07.117 --> 22:10.412
-Show me your Matcher profile. Jennifer!
-No.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.997
I think we can all agree that

22:12.080 --> 22:15.667
the one thing that the MCU
has been missing is S-E-X.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.587
<i>Why does no one have</i>
<i>a love life in the MCU?</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.005
<i>People have love lives.</i>

22:20.088 --> 22:24.509
So, I was very excited to be able to
have that on our show

22:24.593 --> 22:27.095
because that is such a huge part
of everybody's lives.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.891
<i>And here's the thing, like dating</i>
<i>in your 30s, already awful. The worst.</i>

22:30.974 --> 22:33.143
<i>But then you throw all of this stuff</i>
<i>on top of it,</i>

22:33.226 --> 22:35.062
she's gonna have the worst time of it.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.606
That was a test
to make sure you're listening.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.983
I like doing little tests on first dates.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.611
Jen can be quite tightly wound,

22:42.694 --> 22:46.406
and sort of so fixated on work
as her only defining feature that,

22:46.490 --> 22:51.203
<i>Nikki consistently reminds her that</i>
<i>there is a life outside of her job.</i>

22:51.286 --> 22:56.541
<i>And also to, like, embrace</i>
<i>the She-Hulkness of herself.</i>

22:57.292 --> 22:58.585
I'm not proud of this.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.172
So she creates a profile and
she instantly gets all of these matches

23:02.255 --> 23:05.175
and sets up all of these dates
and she goes on a speed-dating round.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.844
Is there anything worse
than dating in your 30s?

23:07.969 --> 23:13.475
If you wanna make partner, the best
thing to do is bill a lot of hours.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.227
That's what my protagonist did.

23:15.310 --> 23:19.564
I have to admit,
I was a fan before we matched.

23:20.148 --> 23:25.070
Todd is a billionaire, playboy,

23:25.153 --> 23:27.197
philanthropist douchebag.

23:27.280 --> 23:31.034
I love Wakanda. You know,
I actually, studied abroad there.

23:31.159 --> 23:34.621
<i>He meets She-Hulk on a date.</i>
<i>He's a total creep.</i>

23:34.746 --> 23:38.417
God, you're just so powerful.
What a specimen.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.837
<i>And then he just starts popping up</i>
<i>in all of these places.</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:47.509
It's very obvious that he wants more
than anything to sleep with She-Hulk.

23:48.343 --> 23:53.306
But then it becomes a little bit
more apparent that there's a much

23:53.765 --> 23:56.726
<i>seedier reason for that.</i>
<i>And that's to get her blood.</i>

Here's the thing, Jen.
I didn't just get handed my powers.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.161
I had to earn them.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.664

<i>to play the villain.</i>

24:17.747 --> 24:20.208

24:20.292 --> 24:23.378
I would like to introduce
our very special guest speaker.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.505
He cost a ton, so you'd better cheer.

TIM ROTH: <i>They asked me</i>
<i>to come back and do this,</i>

24:41.771 --> 24:43.315
<i>I said, "That sounds like fun."</i>

24:43.440 --> 24:47.611
<i>And they came up with this notion</i>
<i>of the character which,</i>

24:47.777 --> 24:52.032
it's a fine line between embarrassing
and pretentious, and villainous.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.034
When it says gang, it's not literal gang.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.661
Just make sure you make
that clear to the parole board.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.787
Yeah, no, I will.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.707
Tim is a character.
He is a total character.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.335
Excuse me, Jen, babe,
sweetheart, doll face.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.878
MASLANY: <i>He was very playful.</i>

25:04.961 --> 25:08.632
<i>And so I think to come into this show</i>
<i>where now it's like a comedy,</i>

25:08.715 --> 25:10.926
it was like a fun thing
to see him navigate.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.220
I'm actually appalling myself
with this tone.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.431
On the page, he was much more likeable

25:16.515 --> 25:18.099
and straightforward

25:18.433 --> 25:21.895
<i>And Tim brought these layers where</i>
<i>you don't know if she should trust him,</i>

25:21.978 --> 25:24.898
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>he still deserves justice.</i>

25:24.981 --> 25:27.943
<i>And I think it makes her character</i>
<i>very sympathetic</i>

25:28.026 --> 25:29.444
because she is like,

25:29.528 --> 25:32.364
"I don't really wanna do this.
This guy tried to kill my cousin.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.324
"But what happened to him was wrong."

25:34.407 --> 25:36.826
And to me, that really hearkened back
to the comics,

25:36.910 --> 25:41.164
<i>to, like, the Jen Walters who will fight</i>
<i>for what is right, no matter what.</i>

25:41.248 --> 25:44.918
Yes, Emil Blonsky is a polarizing figure.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.338
But he has served adequate prison time.

25:48.505 --> 25:52.342
And he has demonstrated that
he has been rehabilitated.

25:52.425 --> 25:56.346
He deserves a future as a free man
and a productive citizen.

26:00.183 --> 26:04.688

This is Emil Blonsky's camp.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.754
We are breaking down
some of the relationships

26:29.838 --> 26:32.549
that are kind of clogging us up
as individuals.

26:32.632 --> 26:36.970
And, you know, doing the work.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.847
We just tryin' to be good people.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.683
We just have different perspective

Man Bull and El √Åguila have been spending
a lot of time together.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.233
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
-And that's great.

26:50.900 --> 26:54.863
But I'm feeling like maybe
it's not healthy.

26:55.572 --> 26:59.284
We're shooting a very atypically
long scene here, which is really fun.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.494
<i>I think usually when you think</i>
<i>of television scenes,</i>

27:01.578 --> 27:04.289
<i>you don't get to really sit and do</i>
<i>some proper scene work.</i>

27:04.372 --> 27:08.835
<i>But this is like a 16 page scene</i>
<i>where we really see, She-Hulk, Jen,</i>

27:08.918 --> 27:14.090
really kind of, open herself up,
share her vulnerabilities,

27:14.174 --> 27:16.760
share her disappointments, and her fears.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.554
And I think it's a really
beautiful opportunity

27:19.638 --> 27:22.140
to connect with who Jen really is.

27:22.223 --> 27:26.186
Everyone legitimately does pay attention
when I'm this.

27:26.269 --> 27:30.357
Like, guys, my colleagues, my boss.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.111
But it does feel like cheating,
in a way,

27:35.528 --> 27:39.366
because I wonder if those people

27:39.449 --> 27:43.078
would like me without all of this.

JENNIFER BOOTH: <i>It epitomizes</i>
<i>these dual sides of our lives, you know?</i>

27:47.666 --> 27:51.044
I think we all wanna be She-Hulk
but we really relate to being Jen Walters.

27:51.127 --> 27:56.049
Maybe you can stop using She-Hulk
as a protective shield

27:56.132 --> 28:00.762
and trust us with Jen.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.934
She's a super-powered being
but you really get into the intricacies

28:06.017 --> 28:08.311
of, like, what she's
dealing with emotionally.

28:09.646 --> 28:13.066
-Yeah!
-Great job.

But that will ruin our case.

suddenly, there was a DJ booth up on,

31:59.542 --> 32:05.840
Madisynn with two Ns, one Y,
but it's not where you think.

32:06.424 --> 32:12.805
Yeah, I feel like I've been preparing for
this role for a long time in my real life.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.391
(CHUCKLES) Is that too personal?

32:15.558 --> 32:19.604
<i>Madisynn's, like, a superhero</i>
<i>of the real world,</i>

32:19.687 --> 32:22.148
<i>who speaks for all of us.</i>

32:22.231 --> 32:24.192
She's present, she lives in the moment.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.653
And I think we can all take a lesson
from her book.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.821
I kinda like browned out and...

32:29.280 --> 32:30.782
Now I'm here.

32:30.907 --> 32:31.991
(RINGS BELL)

32:32.116 --> 32:33.952
WONG: <i>We just had a lot of fun there.</i>

32:34.494 --> 32:36.412
Case closed!

32:36.537 --> 32:42.502
The Madisynn-Wong combination,
goes quite well, really.

32:42.585 --> 32:45.630
He's kind of like sort of just...

32:45.713 --> 32:49.467
He's kind of got this puppy dog, really,
that he can't really do anything about.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.095
-Okay, Wongers, can we get fro-yo?
-No.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.515
We could talk about <i>The Sopranos.</i>

32:55.598 --> 32:56.641
Fine.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.935
No more spoilers.

33:00.687 --> 33:05.191
GOLDSBERRY: <i>The fun of the show</i>
<i>is to combine this legal world</i>

33:05.274 --> 33:11.364
and all of the possibilities
around superhero weirdness.

33:11.447 --> 33:15.576
<i>I mean, what could happen</i>
<i>when you think of the legal ramifications</i>

33:15.660 --> 33:17.620
<i>of some really amazing, awesome powers?</i>

33:17.704 --> 33:20.748
That's what so wonderful
about the Mr. Immortal episode.

33:23.459 --> 33:24.919
DAVID PASQUESI: <i>I'm Mr. Immortal.</i>

33:25.003 --> 33:28.965
I am able to regenerate after death.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.803
Unfortunately,
I don't have any other strengths.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.764
<i>I'm not strong or fast,</i>
<i>or necessarily very bright</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:39.726
<i>but I can come back after I die.</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:43.521
I really do not care
for conflict in any way.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.649
As soon as things get comfortable,
I just exit.

33:46.733 --> 33:50.653
Are you saying that instead
of having a conversation with your wife,

33:51.279 --> 33:53.364
you kill yourself to get out
of the relationship?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.907
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't kill myself.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.910
I'm immortal, so I can't die.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.372
Mallory and I clearly side with the women,

34:01.456 --> 34:02.832
<i>but we have to represent him.</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:06.836
<i>And we had a lot of, lot of really funny,</i>
<i>local Atlanta-based guest stars.</i>

34:06.919 --> 34:11.215
I spent $10,000
on a New Orleans jazz funeral.

34:11.424 --> 34:16.220
The way that the three of them really work
together is very funny to watch.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.514
<i>They really have fallen into a groove.</i>

34:21.392 --> 34:23.686
You're gonna have to pay.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.521
Why are you smiling?

34:26.355 --> 34:27.356
It's kinda fun.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.650
Another character that we had,

34:29.734 --> 34:33.404
<i>that was so well portrayed</i>
<i>and such a great surprise, was Runa.</i>

34:33.654 --> 34:36.365
COIRO: <i>We were auditioning, like,</i>
<i>young, beautiful women.</i>

34:36.449 --> 34:38.367
<i>We really could not find somebody.</i>

34:38.451 --> 34:43.748
And I had this crazy dream that
Taika and Jon Favreau were like,

34:43.831 --> 34:47.668
"Kat, you need to play this role.
We've both been in the movies.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.378
"You need to play the shapeshifter."

34:49.462 --> 34:51.089
And I woke up and I was like,

34:52.173 --> 34:55.176
"No, I definitely don't wanna play
the shapeshifter.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.262
"But maybe,
the takeaway is I want someone old."

34:59.055 --> 35:02.433
And I'm not old but I'm older
than the girls we were auditioning.

35:02.517 --> 35:06.896
Thank you so much. Thanks for the dream.
It's now my dream.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.231
JACOBSON: <i>We auditioned Peg O'Keef.</i>

35:08.356 --> 35:10.108
We were like, "This is the woman for us."

35:10.233 --> 35:12.860
Let that be a warning.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.864
I am, like, the ultimate entitled brat.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.785
However, I'm, I don't know,
3,000 years old.

35:21.077 --> 35:24.330
I know I don't look a day over 2,999,

35:24.831 --> 35:31.045
but for Runa, she has developed
a delicious appetite

35:31.546 --> 35:33.840
<i>for creating trouble everywhere she goes.</i>

35:33.965 --> 35:36.759
<i>I'm not really Megan.</i>

35:40.012 --> 35:43.891
GAO: <i>You watch all these movies in</i>
<i>the MCU and everybody has awesome suits.</i>

35:43.975 --> 35:46.769
You know, we just imagined like,
if we, a normal person,

35:46.853 --> 35:50.606
became a super hero one day, like,
would we even know who to ask?

35:50.690 --> 35:52.984
It's not like you can just Yelp,
"Superhero clothes".

35:53.109 --> 35:54.861
<i>Who makes the stuff? Where do they shop?</i>

35:54.944 --> 35:58.531
My client list is very exclusive
because my work is impeccable.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.158
And I'm very discreet.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.660
Just ask any one of the Avengers.

36:02.743 --> 36:06.164
When I first got the job,
I got to tour the warehouse.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.543
There's a Marvel warehouse in
an undisclosed location.

36:10.918 --> 36:15.756
And I got to tour it,
and I saw all of the incredible tailors

36:15.840 --> 36:19.594
and designers making the actual costumes,
and so I learned a lot.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.680
<i>There's a lot of precision,</i>
<i>there's a lot of artistry.</i>

36:22.763 --> 36:25.016
<i>So, it just informed my character.</i>

36:25.099 --> 36:28.853
Tinsley, order extra bolts
of the stretch wool.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.731
We're going to need a lot.

36:33.441 --> 36:38.112
<i>I also kind of went back into the archives</i>
<i>and got a little crazy about Basquiat.</i>

36:38.321 --> 36:43.492
What I liked was the madness of his art
and also the way that he looked.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.619
It was so specific.

36:44.911 --> 36:49.624
<i>And then I also went down</i>
<i>a rabbit hole of, like, black hairstyles.</i>

36:49.707 --> 36:52.376
'Cause I felt like,
"Ah, what's Luke doing?"

36:52.585 --> 36:56.339
He's like halfway in the past
and he's, you know, in the future.

36:56.505 --> 37:00.676
-JEN: Oh, I like it!
-Of course you do, because I'm a genius.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.845
And I landed at an eighties mullet.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.806
I don't know who told you
that you could pull off this color,

37:05.890 --> 37:08.851
but you should go back to them
and shoot them.

37:09.435 --> 37:12.313
GAO: <i>Now, in the post</i> Endgame <i>world,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

37:12.438 --> 37:15.149
<i>there are just more and more</i>
<i>and more superhumans</i>

37:15.274 --> 37:18.361
and there's gotta be one spoiled rich kid
who's gonna want that,

37:18.444 --> 37:22.448
and then use their parents' money to fund,
forcing this to happen.

37:22.531 --> 37:28.913
The store might be closed,
but you forgot about the Guard Frog.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.999
When I put that suit on,
it was like, "Wow."

37:32.375 --> 37:34.001
<i>I look in the mirror, and I'm like,</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:36.837
<i>"I can't believe that I'm in a super-suit</i>
<i>right now. This is insane."</i>

37:36.921 --> 37:40.466
There's no shame in retreat.
Live to leap another day.

37:40.549 --> 37:44.011
Time to ribbit and rip it.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.013
That's, like, three catchphrases.
Pick a lane, man.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.348
Whoo!

37:50.059 --> 37:54.313
You know, Kat sent me a picture
the night before of, like, my throne,

37:54.397 --> 37:56.607
and she was just kind of like, you know,

37:56.691 --> 38:00.152
"Hey, just letting you know,
this is kind of what we're lookin' at

38:00.236 --> 38:02.196
"for your lair."

38:02.655 --> 38:06.117
<i>Even then I was just like,</i>
<i>"What? This was made for me?"</i>

38:06.367 --> 38:08.452
<i>And then I show up that day</i>

38:08.536 --> 38:11.038
and me and Griffin are kinda
walking in at the same time,

38:11.122 --> 38:13.833
and he was like,
"Brandon, look behind you."

38:13.916 --> 38:16.794
<i>I turn around</i>
<i>and it's my character on the wall,</i>

38:16.877 --> 38:18.296
bouncin' around and all that,

38:18.379 --> 38:20.131
and I said
"You've got to be kidding me."

38:20.256 --> 38:23.009
Guys, how do we feel about
the name Leap Squad?

38:24.051 --> 38:26.012
You know, like, "Leap Squad!"

38:26.137 --> 38:30.850
We had scouted this used auto part place.

38:30.933 --> 38:35.604
And we had this very dark,
stereotypical villain's lair.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.149
And Kevin Feige actually looked at it
and said,

38:38.232 --> 38:40.943
<i>"It's cool but it feels like</i>
<i>it needs another layer."</i>

38:41.027 --> 38:44.989
<i>And when he said that, we kind of</i>
<i>went crazy with this frog theme.</i>

38:46.073 --> 38:47.950
ELENA: <i>'Cause you think</i>
<i>about poisonous frogs.</i>

38:48.117 --> 38:52.496
<i>They are all colorful like a,</i>
<i>you know, strong yellow or blue.</i>

38:52.580 --> 38:56.500
So that was kind of an inspiration
for that environment.

38:58.544 --> 39:00.755
I can't believe this dodo has henchmen.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.216
Actually, I can.
I bet these goons work for his dad.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.970
We were in the writers' room
and breaking the show.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.639
You know, we really thought
a lot of the magic of the show,

39:10.723 --> 39:14.727
aside from living in Jen's world,
would be tying it to the larger MCU

39:14.810 --> 39:17.355
<i>with all of these different</i>
<i>kind of court cases.</i>

39:17.438 --> 39:21.484
And I think we, we put Daredevil
on kind of, like, a wishlist,

39:21.567 --> 39:25.112
<i>'cause we were all fans of Charlie's</i>
<i>and of the original show.</i>

39:25.196 --> 39:27.281
GAO: <i>The approach</i>
<i>with bringing him in was,</i>

39:27.365 --> 39:29.325
<i>"Okay, well, he's a lawyer, so, obviously,</i>

39:29.408 --> 39:32.244
<i>"you want to see the two of them</i>
<i>go head-to-head in the courtroom."</i>

39:32.328 --> 39:33.454
But also, you know,

39:33.537 --> 39:38.376
he's the guy who's doing what Jen Walters
is pushing up against,

39:38.459 --> 39:41.754
<i>which is to be a superhero and a lawyer</i>
<i>at the exact same time.</i>

39:41.879 --> 39:45.132
<i>And we wanted to make him, you know,</i>
<i>in keeping with the tone of the series,</i>

39:45.216 --> 39:48.010
<i>a little bit lighter,</i>
<i>a little bit funnier, and also,</i>

39:48.094 --> 39:49.929
who doesn't want to hook up
with Daredevil?

39:50.012 --> 39:51.972
We're all feeling this, right,
it's not just me?

39:53.099 --> 39:56.727
I was doing some theater
on Broadway with Tom Hiddleston.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.397
And, of course, Kevin and Tom
know each other very well,

39:59.480 --> 40:03.442
and Kevin came to see the play and I said
hello afterwards and shook his hand.

40:03.526 --> 40:07.988
<i>But there was no conversation whatsoever</i>
<i>about coming back or anything like that.</i>

40:08.072 --> 40:09.865
<i>And then it was on July 10,</i>

40:09.949 --> 40:13.202
<i>I was in the garden at home and</i>
<i>playing with the kids and the phone rang.</i>

40:13.369 --> 40:15.371
And it was Kevin Feige. And I was...

40:15.454 --> 40:16.789
I thought it was a prank.

40:16.956 --> 40:21.168
<i>And, you know, Kevin said that they had</i>
<i>some plans for me and wanted me to,</i>

40:21.252 --> 40:24.255
potentially do a couple of things.
He just wanted to check and see

40:24.380 --> 40:27.550
if I was interested and willing
to come back and be part of

40:28.259 --> 40:32.012
the MCU, which was,
not a hard question to answer.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.348
So, are you, like, a superhero?

40:34.849 --> 40:37.893
Like the Gold Devil?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.396
I'm Daredevil.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.693
Charlie had to inform me that
the character could not, in fact, see.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.862
That is not true. That's not true.

40:47.987 --> 40:53.826
There's a joke we have, we've always had,
which is that "It's very easy to forget."

40:53.909 --> 40:57.246
<i>Because Matt Murdock is so capable,</i>

40:57.329 --> 41:01.083
<i>and that his visual impairment doesn't</i>
<i>actually inhibit him in any way,</i>

41:01.208 --> 41:04.503
you always have to be reminded that
there are certain things...

41:04.587 --> 41:07.423
You can't actually really look at things
in the same way.

41:07.506 --> 41:10.509
But, like, it can sound really
condescending when I'm like,

41:10.593 --> 41:13.262
-"Yeah, he's blind, by the way."
-He's not condescending at all.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.306
One of the first things we had,
it was scripted,

41:15.389 --> 41:16.932
they look at each other and I said,

41:17.016 --> 41:19.351
"Oh, this is the moment
where they look at each other."

41:19.435 --> 41:23.355
And he so politely, he said,
"How do... Well, I, I don't...

41:23.439 --> 41:24.732
"He's blind."

41:24.815 --> 41:27.651
Remind me how many times you've taken out
a warehouse full of goons.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.820
Remind me again
who has the superpowers here?

41:30.529 --> 41:32.114
I'm pointing at myself.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.075
Yeah, I know.
I have echo location, remember?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.411
It'd been so long since
I played the character that

41:37.495 --> 41:38.579
it was a little bit like

41:38.662 --> 41:42.249
"God, I hope
I still remember who this guy is,

41:42.333 --> 41:43.834
"if I can still find the feelings."

41:43.918 --> 41:46.003
<i>The suit helped that,</i>
<i>I put that on, I was like,</i>

41:46.086 --> 41:47.087
<i>"I remember this."</i>

41:47.213 --> 41:50.799
It was really, really fun seeing
Daredevil in his suit.

41:50.883 --> 41:54.637
<i>On the day Charlie came out in the suit,</i>
<i>but he didn't have the cowl on yet</i>

41:54.720 --> 41:57.806
and he gets to his mark and
he's in position and everybody's ready,

41:57.890 --> 42:01.310
<i>and the very last thing he did</i>
<i>was finally put the cowl on.</i>

42:01.393 --> 42:03.312
I love this sound.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.898
And as soon as that cowl was on his head,

42:05.981 --> 42:07.942
<i>all of the extras,</i>
<i>we had a big crowd,</i>

42:08.025 --> 42:10.110
<i>and all of them</i>
<i>started applauding and cheering,</i>

42:10.194 --> 42:11.445
and it was just so cool.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.739
I feel like I've actually
come out of retirement.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.993
They asked me to come to Los Angeles
to have a suit fitting.

42:18.285 --> 42:21.330
And I assumed it was just
to see if the old one still fit.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.332
Make sure I haven't put
on too much weight.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.584
And, so I flew in.
I went to the costume department

42:25.668 --> 42:29.255
<i>and on the wall, there was a graphic</i>
<i>of a superhero suit.</i>

42:29.338 --> 42:32.341
Initially I was like, "Is tha..."
I couldn't figure out who it was.

42:32.424 --> 42:34.385
I realized it was the new Daredevil suit,

42:34.468 --> 42:37.471
<i>and they'd incorporated</i>
<i>the gold or the yellow</i>

42:37.555 --> 42:39.682
<i>from some of the earlier Daredevil comics.</i>

42:39.807 --> 42:43.352
It feels like this is the first step
in an evolution of this suit

42:43.435 --> 42:45.646
<i>which is why it has</i>
<i>the gold panels in there.</i>

42:45.729 --> 42:50.651
<i>It's almost meant to feel a little bit</i>
<i>like a primer part of the suit.</i>

42:50.734 --> 42:54.280
<i>And it's really fun</i>
<i>seeing Charlie in that suit.</i>

42:54.780 --> 42:57.533
-Think I'm gonna wear it home.
-Okay. See you later.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.369
You need to back off.

43:00.494 --> 43:01.579
And waste this outfit?

43:01.662 --> 43:03.122
The suits are amazing.

43:03.205 --> 43:06.208
And I'm so excited, personally,
about her suit

43:06.292 --> 43:08.586
<i>because it was something that,</i>

43:08.669 --> 43:12.089
<i>you know, we as a team really developed</i>
<i>and really talked about.</i>

43:12.214 --> 43:15.217
We look at who, you know,
she was in the comics

43:15.301 --> 43:16.802
when she was in the suit,

43:17.094 --> 43:22.933
<i>what elements of that suit were important</i>
<i>to everybody and especially color palette.</i>

43:23.017 --> 43:26.186
<i>And so, all of us together</i>
<i>trying to figure out</i>

43:26.312 --> 43:29.148
<i>what is gonna be</i>
<i>the best look for Tatiana.</i>

43:29.273 --> 43:33.569
One of the things we wanted to accomplish
with her suit was have it be powerful,

43:33.652 --> 43:37.698
<i>you know, not be male-gazey</i>
<i>and all hypersexual.</i>

43:37.781 --> 43:41.285
But also be free and show her body off.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.747
She-Hulk smash.

43:44.913 --> 43:48.542
It's cool to take a character
who isn't slick and isn't cool

43:48.626 --> 43:53.589
and isn't confident physically
or any of that and put her in this suit

43:53.672 --> 43:55.591
<i>that feels very confident.</i>

43:55.674 --> 44:00.429
And it does change me and it does
feel like I can feel Jen's excitement.

44:00.846 --> 44:03.307
And like her, kind of,
wonder at getting to be...

44:03.390 --> 44:05.184
Like, I, I'm going, like,

44:05.267 --> 44:08.520
"Oh, my God, I get to be a superhero
the same way that I think she is."

GAO: <i>We really, really,</i>
<i>really struggled with the finale.</i>

44:17.154 --> 44:20.699
We started off doing a lot of versions
of the finale that were much more

44:20.783 --> 44:23.827
just like straight and very,
very Marvel movie, you know,

44:23.911 --> 44:26.664
<i>and it just never felt right for us</i>
<i>to just end in, like,</i>

44:26.747 --> 44:31.168
a big set piece fight and you know,
and take out the bad guy

44:31.251 --> 44:35.047
and it just always felt like,
"Oh, it's a different show now."

44:35.130 --> 44:37.925
And Kevin was the first to kind of
pinpoint that. He was like,

44:38.008 --> 44:39.426
<i>"This isn't a Marvel movie.</i>

44:39.510 --> 44:41.887
<i>"Why are you trying to make it end</i>
<i>like a Marvel movie?</i>

44:41.970 --> 44:43.389
<i>"That's not what the show is."</i>

44:43.472 --> 44:47.101
<i>And it was just really, really wonderful</i>
<i>and freeing for him to say that.</i>

44:47.267 --> 44:49.478
This is not gonna work, right?

the Marvel Cinematic Universe

46:31.330 --> 46:32.998

46:34.583 --> 46:40.255
There's a lot of ways that the show
kinda busts through to the viewer,

46:40.380 --> 46:45.677
<i>the same way that She-Hulk in the comics</i>
<i>spoke to the writer and the illustrator.</i>

46:45.761 --> 46:48.013

47:05.781 --> 47:09.159
Wow, She-Hulk. Welcome to Marvel Studios.
How can we help you?

47:09.243 --> 47:10.327

47:10.410 --> 47:13.288

47:13.372 --> 47:14.706
<i>the inner sanctum of Kevin</i>

47:14.832 --> 47:17.709

47:19.670 --> 47:22.714

47:41.650 --> 47:46.655
Yeah. Why would I expect
a giant AI brain and not a man?

47:46.738 --> 47:49.408
It's so nuts. It's so absurd.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.995

GAO: <i>In the script, I specified that</i>
<i>when you meet the AI K.E.V.I.N,</i>

48:27.237 --> 48:31.283
that it was just wearing
a classic Kevin Feige black baseball hat.

48:31.408 --> 48:34.494
<i>VisDev was doing different</i>
<i>concept drawings of Kevin</i>

48:34.578 --> 48:37.122
<i>and he always had</i>
<i>a little black baseball hat.</i>

48:37.205 --> 48:40.834
<i>And then when Kevin saw it,</i>
<i>the real Kevin, he was like,</i>

48:40.918 --> 48:43.754
<i>"That doesn't make any sense.</i>
<i>Why would a machine make a hat?"</i>

48:43.837 --> 48:45.672
I was like, "You have a problem with that?

"That's where you
draw the line with logic?

<i>I leave that debate up to the Internet.</i>

48:56.892 --> 49:00.228

<i>built into the machine</i>
<i>so that it is part of the machine,</i>

49:03.482 --> 49:04.900
<i>but it still looks like a hat.</i>
