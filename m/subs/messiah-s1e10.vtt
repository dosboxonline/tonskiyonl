00:14.556 --> 00:15.974
[horn beeps]

00:59.184 --> 01:00.685
[in Arabic] Careful... put it down there.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.064
Good boys. Did anyone follow you?

01:06.316 --> 01:07.150
Stop! Hands up!

01:16.743 --> 01:17.786
[Aviram] Stop!

01:23.208 --> 01:25.126

-[grunts]

01:33.384 --> 01:34.844
[muffled whimpering]

01:44.270 --> 01:45.522
Well...

01:45.605 --> 01:47.357
"baker boy"...

01:49.609 --> 01:52.237
Everyone who meets me...

01:54.489 --> 01:55.657
-talks.
-[glass breaks]

02:00.495 --> 02:01.871
Do you know why?

02:04.415 --> 02:05.291
I am...

02:06.376 --> 02:09.587
prepared to go the extra mile.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.048
[boy gulps]

02:12.924 --> 02:14.425
The sensible ones...

02:15.051 --> 02:16.302
they talk right away.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.346
But the stupid ones...

02:21.182 --> 02:22.308
they suffer...

02:23.726 --> 02:24.811
for nothing.

02:27.313 --> 02:28.148
Now...

02:28.982 --> 02:29.816
[gasping]

02:29.899 --> 02:31.943
are you going to be sensible...

02:32.026 --> 02:33.778
-[whirring]
-or stupid?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.698
[crying]

02:37.365 --> 02:38.992
Please... please...

02:39.534 --> 02:42.996
-I'm not the one you beg to.
-I'll talk!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.999
[panicked breathing]

02:49.711 --> 02:50.545
[yelps]

02:50.628 --> 02:51.921
Relax, man! Relax...

02:54.716 --> 02:56.134
Take it easy.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.803
[boy talking]

03:03.099 --> 03:05.101
[Alon talking]

03:06.311 --> 03:07.478
[footstep]

03:08.688 --> 03:09.731
Well?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.323
Spit it out.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.742
[Alon sighs]

03:25.038 --> 03:27.248
His name is Rashid Khalid Al Nuaimi.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.420
His father is Nuaimi.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.384
Avi...

04:13.753 --> 04:15.797
[in English] The guns are not necessary.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.508
[Aviram, in English] I know.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.052
You're welcome.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.642
Yes, take a good last look.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.355
You will be forgotten in a week.
They won't remember a thing about you.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.899
America,

04:35.400 --> 04:37.235
it's like a silly schoolgirl.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.572
But you know that already, don't you?

04:58.715 --> 04:59.549
[woman screams]

04:59.632 --> 05:01.634
[sirens wailing]

05:02.760 --> 05:03.678
[shouting]

05:05.972 --> 05:07.724
[radio chatter]

05:25.908 --> 05:27.368
[baby crying]

05:42.050 --> 05:45.636
[Felix] She's still seizing.
Anna, listen, just get in the cab.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.430
-What hospital?
-[woman] Providence, on 12th.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.015
Providence, on 12th.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.482
[Eva] Switch to that lower camera.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.410
Can you zoom in?

06:14.791 --> 06:15.792
Fuck.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.419
Get close on that number plate.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.301
Fucking idiot.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.313
[distant sirens wailing]

07:23.067 --> 07:25.111
[Eva] <i>So why wasn't the FBI at the church?</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:28.614
I told you. Order came
from the head office for us to stand down.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.033
-We were taken off the detail.
-So you didn't think to check?

07:31.117 --> 07:31.951
[scoffs]

07:32.034 --> 07:34.829
We got a ping on that E-ZPass,
for the license plate.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.080
Where?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.959
Uh... I-95 turnpike, entering Delaware.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.836
Delaware.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.296
I need a map.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.679
There's another ping.
Uh, Memorial Highway One, headed south.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.723
What airfields are out here?

07:53.806 --> 07:56.392
Uh, Dover, Georgetown,
Wilmington are all north.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.519
-No, smaller.
-There's Chorman airfield,

07:58.603 --> 07:59.896
but that's government.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.272
When was that ping?

08:01.355 --> 08:02.940
It's two hours ago.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.820
Access the State Department server,
and get all flight clearances

08:07.904 --> 08:10.781
for Chorman airfield this evening,
including diplomatic planes.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.742
I want tail numbers and flight plans.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.910
Okay, what's your thinking?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.370
I don't have time to explain it,
just do it.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.499
Do it.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.501
Yes, ma'am.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.004
[ringing tone]

08:28.299 --> 08:29.842
[phone chiming]

08:43.689 --> 08:44.607
Damn it.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.321
There's only one flight out of Chorman.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.489
Just took off.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.533
Where's it headed?

08:53.616 --> 08:56.160
Says its flight plan's classified...

08:56.244 --> 08:57.453
So's the tail number.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.330
Asshole.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.253
-[agent] Where are you going?
-Flight's just gone international.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.338
Need-to-know basis.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.806
[bells jangling]

09:20.268 --> 09:22.019
[bleating]

09:25.815 --> 09:28.234
[speaking Arabic]

09:36.033 --> 09:38.077
Go... Get in there...

09:38.160 --> 09:40.329
Come on! You're making me late!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.081
Get in! Go on!

10:04.770 --> 10:10.735
[woman, in French] <i>Italy is just across</i>
<i>the Mediterranean from Algeria.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:13.946
<i>Malik, there you are.</i>

10:14.655 --> 10:16.699
Yes. And I'm sorry I was late.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.118
I was bringing the goats in
to be milked, and one got away.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.745
<i>That's okay.</i>

10:20.828 --> 10:22.163
But that's not the worst part...

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
This goat, he was taken by a lion!

10:25.082 --> 10:26.542
[laughter]

10:26.626 --> 10:28.377
<i>A lion? Really?</i>

10:29.086 --> 10:33.341
[in Arabic] There are no lions here.
Malik is always telling stories.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.135
There was a lion,
the most ferocious one I've seen.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.138
[in French] But don't worry, Mademoiselle,
I had my stick...

10:39.221 --> 10:41.682
and chased him away,
and saved my goat.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.312
[in Arabic] Last week, he saw a spaceship.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.189
[laughter]

10:49.023 --> 10:50.608
[machines beeping]

11:02.953 --> 11:04.163
[Anna gasps]

11:04.246 --> 11:05.623
Sweetheart.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.042
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.462
You had us so worried.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.673
Mom.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.050
[Felix] Rebecca.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.222
We need the nurse. Get the nurse.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.598
[call bell rings]

11:24.684 --> 11:28.854
-What do you... remember?
-Let her be a moment, Felix.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.399
I was dreamin'.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.069
It was terrible.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.447
I was standin' in front of everyone.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.283
-That wasn't a dream, honey.
-[Anna] It's okay, sweetheart.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.704
-What made you go out there?
-This can wait.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.497
He left.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.833
[Felix] You saw him leave?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.920
-Where'd he go?
-Is that all you can think about?

11:53.003 --> 11:56.674
-I just need to know.
-Your daughter almost died, Felix.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
Where's your goddamn perspective?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.518
He's gone, Dad.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.648
I don't know where,
but I don't think he's comin' back.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.585
[speaking quietly]

13:04.909 --> 13:05.826
Thank you.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.290
It's only water,
but feel free to turn it into wine.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.170
I'm glad we're having
this time together, Aviram.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.256
We'll have plenty of time together,
you and me.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.843
When we land, they are going to put us
in a very deep, dark cell,

13:22.927 --> 13:26.305
and throw away the key, and there will be
no guard to convince to let you out.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.684
From now on, my job...

13:32.311 --> 13:33.229
is you.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.982
Yes.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.026
It is.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.597
[crowd cheering]

14:19.191 --> 14:20.943
[man, in Arabic] Hey... Stay awake!

14:26.115 --> 14:27.324
Stay awake. Stay awake.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.523
[reporter speaking Arabic]

14:59.607 --> 15:01.358
[Arabic commentary continues]

15:05.195 --> 15:07.281
-[Eva] Is this stream live?
-[Bailey] Yes.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.866
Who's claiming responsibility?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.701
No one yet.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.997
Qamar was there. Is he okay?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.459
No word from him yet.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.216
I should have been there.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.344
Yes, you should have.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.347
I've been telling you to stay on this.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.850
-This should never have happened.
-You're right.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.812
I'm sorry.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.234
Where's Golshiri?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.281
-Eva.
-We need to talk.

15:50.532 --> 15:54.578
The car that took Golshiri, we traced it
to a government airfield in Delaware.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.665
-Government?
-Details of the flight are classified,

15:57.748 --> 15:59.750
but I'm guessing
you know nothing about this.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.711
-Of course not.
-No prizes for guessing who does.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.719
This goes to air in 20 minutes.
You need to cut your VO.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.973
It's written,
I just need to read it. Relax.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.057
[man] <i>...West Bank.</i>

16:15.140 --> 16:16.934
<i>Ah, we're hearing that people are injured,</i>

16:17.017 --> 16:19.061
<i>and unfortunately,</i>
<i>we do not have any numbers.</i>

16:19.144 --> 16:21.647
That shot of the stretcher with the kid,
put that in the bin.

<i>...Hassan speak.</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:25.734

<i>But Palestinian authorities have been...</i>

<i>...terrorist attack...</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:40.374
<i>We will be crossing live</i>
<i>to our correspondents in Israel...</i>

16:40.457 --> 16:42.376
-[sighs]
<i>-We are starting to get ...</i>

16:43.961 --> 16:46.380
[Bailey] <i>Your department</i>
<i>gave clearance for that plane to land.</i>

16:46.463 --> 16:47.756
We need to know where it's going.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.842
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>
<i>Arrest him when he lands?</i>

16:49.925 --> 16:51.844
It's over. The deal is done.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.013
We need to know where
in Israel it's landing.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.806
We need the tail number
and the flight plans.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.810
Do I need to wake the president, Danny?

17:07.651 --> 17:09.361
It's approaching Spanish airspace.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.656
-Keep a lock on that.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:13.449 --> 17:17.327
-Why can't we force the plane to land?
-[Bailey] Diplomatic jet. It's sovereign.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.787
He was taken against his will.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.123
We're sending him back into that.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.292
It's all connected.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.711
It all goes back to him.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.845
We wait till he lands.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.013
And then what?

17:39.808 --> 17:41.226
You create an opportunity.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.565
I'll scramble a team.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.075
The fuck you're looking at?

17:57.951 --> 18:01.038
We never finished our conversation
about Megiddo.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.709
Don't you want to get it off your chest?

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
Secrets are so heavy to carry around.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.849
God knows your secrets.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.227
And loves you anyway.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.480
Sin.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.151
Sin is just a failure
to choose goodness, that's all.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.071
Goodness is a choice.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.330
Every moment is an opportunity
to make a choice.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.167
The choice to think a good thought,
to think a bad thought,

18:47.251 --> 18:49.378
to act on it, to let it pass.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.968
That is God's great blessing.

18:56.593 --> 19:00.472
That in every moment,
we can create ourselves again.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.350
Aviram.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.602
Make a choice.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.108
Isn't that convenient, huh?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.904
We can all be forgiven
and start fresh again.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.367
People have been hating and killing
since we came down from the trees.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.911
If there's a God,
he should be ashamed of himself.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.707
"Made in the likeness of Him."

19:30.210 --> 19:32.921
[in Hebrew] You're unredeemable.
That's what you think.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.343
So you project your shame onto God.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.681
[in English]
Why don't you shut the fuck up now?

19:43.599 --> 19:48.103
[in Hebrew] Our sins have a way
of punishing us when we ignore them.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.357
That boy.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.863
He'll be the last thing
you see before you die.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.674
[Miriam] This better be worth it.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.801
You'll need to be nicer than that.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.097
Can we cut the bullshit?
It's late and I've got a story to update.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.851
This is gonna blow your story
off the front page.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.730
I don't work in print,
but I'll forgive the analogy.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.608
Oh, you're gonna be thanking me,
not just forgiving me.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.694
His real name is Payam Golshiri.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.905
Whose real name?

20:40.572 --> 20:41.949
Your messiah.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.746
There's enough in there
to get you started.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.539
You got a busy night ahead of you.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.124
Why are you doing this?

20:54.628 --> 20:55.587
I owe you.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.675
What's the real reason?

21:00.842 --> 21:03.136
Run with it. You'll see.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.167
[beeping]

21:39.131 --> 21:42.551
[PA] <i>Calling the flight deck. Emergency.</i>
<i>Fasten your seat belts.</i>

21:44.428 --> 21:46.096
[alarms wailing]

22:09.036 --> 22:10.412
[gasping]

22:12.539 --> 22:13.665
[Rashid] Please!

22:17.336 --> 22:18.670
Please.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.672
Please. I'm sorry.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.342
What are you sorry for?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.427
For everything.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.221
[Aviram] Everything?

22:28.305 --> 22:29.723
You're sorry for everything?

22:30.807 --> 22:33.477
You're sorry
for all the wrong in the world?

22:34.936 --> 22:36.188
No... no.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.439
I'm sorry for what I...

22:39.274 --> 22:40.901
I don't care what you did.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.742
I care who you are.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.453
[Rashid] I told you my name.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.623
[Aviram] Yes.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.541
I know your father.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.504
He's had a lot to do with my life.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.464
He shaped me.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.716
He gave me my conviction.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.762
He's had more influence over me
than any other person.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.598
He's killed many people...

23:13.141 --> 23:14.684
and boasted about it.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.938
Including...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.232
my mother.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.608
[Rashid gasping]

23:36.832 --> 23:38.417
[Aviram] You weren't even born...

23:40.085 --> 23:42.254
but you've inherited his sin.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.217
[Rashid] No, no! Please!

23:47.968 --> 23:49.469
<i>I'm only 14!</i>

23:50.095 --> 23:51.721
My mother doesn't even know where I am.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.807
Please! Her heart will be broken!

23:54.933 --> 23:56.852
I bear witness that there is
no God but Allah...

23:56.935 --> 23:59.271
<i>and Muhammad is his messenger!</i>

23:59.354 --> 24:02.065
[Rashid continues praying]

24:05.735 --> 24:06.778
[in Hebrew ]I'm sorry.

24:14.244 --> 24:18.081
There's four passengers, one's Golshiri,
so we'll at least need a team of six.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.000
-We've lost it.
-What?

24:20.083 --> 24:21.042
The plane.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.211
What do you mean?

24:23.962 --> 24:26.840
Just dropped off. No signal. It was
right there and then it disappeared.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.758
What are you saying?
They're flying under radar?

24:28.842 --> 24:31.428
That type of plane can't fly
at those low altitudes.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.224
So what, then?

24:50.030 --> 24:51.406
[phone buzzing]

25:00.415 --> 25:01.249
Yes.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.756
Thank you.

25:11.968 --> 25:12.969
[door closes]

25:14.304 --> 25:16.306
[breathing heavily]

25:30.195 --> 25:31.279
[sighs]

26:02.352 --> 26:03.270
Sweetie?

26:05.730 --> 26:06.565
Rae.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.027
Raeah. Honey?

26:12.737 --> 26:13.572
Raeah.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.117
Jonah!

26:20.203 --> 26:22.747
[Miriam] <i>It's being called</i>
<i>the hoax of the century,</i>

26:22.831 --> 26:24.291
<i>or maybe the millennium.</i>

26:24.374 --> 26:26.543
<i>The man they call the Messiah is mortal.</i>

26:27.460 --> 26:30.880
<i>He was born Payam Golshiri,</i>
<i>an Iranian national,</i>

26:30.964 --> 26:34.718
<i>orphaned at an early age</i>
<i>during the Kuwaiti crisis of 1991.</i>

26:35.302 --> 26:39.180
<i>He and his brother Adar were raised</i>
<i>by their uncle, a street performer,</i>

26:39.264 --> 26:41.850
<i>who apparently taught them</i>
<i>the art of illusion.</i>

26:41.933 --> 26:47.105
<i>It seems Golshiri also has suffered from</i>
<i>psychological issues throughout his life,</i>

26:47.188 --> 26:50.567
<i>being committed to a mental institution</i>
<i>during his 20s.</i>

26:50.650 --> 26:52.944
<i>This startling news</i>
<i>came to light this morning</i>

26:53.028 --> 26:56.197
<i>from a document leaked</i>
<i>by undisclosed sources in the White House</i>

26:56.281 --> 27:01.244
<i>that reveals Golshiri has been</i>
<i>under investigation by the CIA</i>

27:01.328 --> 27:02.787
<i>for the past several weeks.</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:06.541
<i>The exhaustive report also mentions</i>
<i>concerning links</i>

27:06.625 --> 27:09.586
<i>to radical thinker</i>
<i>and dissident Oscar Wallace,</i>

27:09.669 --> 27:15.050
<i>an outspoken opponent of capitalism</i>
<i>and proponent of civil disobedience,</i>

27:15.133 --> 27:19.721

27:20.263 --> 27:23.183
<i>As of this morning,</i>
<i>Golshiri cannot be located.</i>

27:23.266 --> 27:27.312
<i>He was residing in a Washington DC</i>
<i>luxury hotel until last evening,</i>

27:27.395 --> 27:30.899

[Rebecca] Dad.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.163
-Reverend, please, just one question!
-[clamoring]

27:45.997 --> 27:47.415
-Excuse me.
-Reverend!

27:47.499 --> 27:49.334
-[Felix] Excuse me, please.
-[woman] Reverend!

27:49.417 --> 27:51.628
-Excuse me.
-[man] Will you go back to Texas?

27:51.711 --> 27:52.962
-Excuse me.
-Tell us something!

27:53.046 --> 27:54.506
That's his real name.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.719
[chiming]

28:10.939 --> 28:11.856
Daddy.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.526
Yes. We saw.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.028
Course not.

28:19.864 --> 28:24.119
[woman, in Arabic] <i>His brother,</i>
<i>Adar Golshiri, confirmed the report...</i>

[Adar, in Farsi]
<i>You know I'm doing a trick... </i>

<i>At</i> <i>worst, you're entertained...</i>

28:37.132 --> 28:39.759

-Baby?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.407
Rae?

29:04.701 --> 29:05.827
[sobs]

29:08.121 --> 29:09.080
Baby?

29:09.706 --> 29:10.832
[sobbing]

29:33.438 --> 29:35.231
-What do you want?
-An explanation.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.318
Here's my explanation. I outrank you.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.403
You don't have any jurisdiction over me.

29:40.487 --> 29:44.365
-Really? I'll bury you in a second.
-You just burned a whole operation.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.950
And I saved my president.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.869
That information was classified.

29:50.079 --> 29:50.914
Look.

29:51.581 --> 29:52.499
I know you.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.459
I know who you are.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.586
I know who your father was.

29:57.045 --> 29:59.172
That holds no currency here anymore.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.633
-He has nothing to do with this.
-That's right.

30:02.091 --> 30:05.345
Your job is
to give the administration information.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.096
Our job is to do stuff with it.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.140
You brought down a diplomatic plane.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.353
That's a very serious accusation.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.440
I'd watch what I was saying,
if I were you.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.542

36:14.881 --> 36:16.507
[Malik, in Arabic] Here... drink.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.596
How did he do it?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.060
Who are you?

36:29.312 --> 36:30.188
Malik.

36:31.105 --> 36:32.315
You were dead.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.196
What?

36:38.279 --> 36:40.448
You were dead. He raised you.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.575
The man...

36:43.659 --> 36:44.577
...he is magic.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.165
He put his hand on your heart
and you began to breathe.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.000
What are you talking about?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.419
You and that other man there...

36:54.879 --> 36:56.464
[coughing]

37:00.426 --> 37:01.719
You were both dead.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.596
Your skin was gray.

37:03.679 --> 37:06.724
You had flies crawling in your mouth...
and then he touched you

37:06.807 --> 37:08.100
and you came back.
