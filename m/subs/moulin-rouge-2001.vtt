01:26.712 --> 01:30.381
[SINGING]
There was a boy

01:34.553 --> 01:41.017
A very strange enchanted boy

01:43.729 --> 01:50.359
They say he wandered very far

01:50.527 --> 01:54.238
Very far

01:54.907 --> 01:59.744
Over land and sea

02:00.412 --> 02:03.748
MAN:
Don't be fooled! Evil!

02:04.416 --> 02:06.751
TOULOUSE:
A little shy

02:07.085 --> 02:09.753
Turn away from this village of sin!

02:10.088 --> 02:13.090
TOULOUSE:
And sad of eye

02:13.425 --> 02:17.094
But very wise

02:18.263 --> 02:22.058
Was he

02:22.226 --> 02:26.938
And then one day

02:30.275 --> 02:32.068
A magic day

02:32.236 --> 02:37.573
He passed my way

02:38.784 --> 02:45.706
And while we spoke of many things

02:45.874 --> 02:50.253
Fools and kings

02:50.420 --> 02:57.426
This he said to me

03:00.097 --> 03:04.851
The greatest thing

03:05.018 --> 03:10.273
You'll ever learn

03:10.440 --> 03:15.570
Is just to love

03:17.281 --> 03:20.616
And be loved

03:20.784 --> 03:27.123
In return

03:27.416 --> 03:29.417
CHRISTIAN:
The Moulin Rouge.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.256
A nightclub...

03:38.427 --> 03:41.262
...a dance hall and a bordello...

03:42.931 --> 03:45.600
...ruled over by Harold Zidler.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.145
A kingdom of nighttime pleasures...

03:50.689 --> 03:52.773
...where the rich and powerful
played with...

03:52.941 --> 03:56.652
...the young and beautiful creatures
of the underworld.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.949
The most beautiful of all these...

04:02.284 --> 04:04.452
...was the woman who I loved.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.079
Satine.

04:07.247 --> 04:12.335
A courtesan, she sold her love to men.

04:12.502 --> 04:16.255
They called her
"The Sparkling Diamond."

04:16.423 --> 04:18.466
And she was the star...

04:19.635 --> 04:21.802
...of the Moulin Rouge.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.362
The woman I loved...

04:39.529 --> 04:41.781
...is...

04:45.077 --> 04:47.328
...dead.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.084
I first came to Paris...

04:53.251 --> 04:57.213
...one year ago.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.552
lt was  1 899, the Summer of Love.

05:03.720 --> 05:08.766
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge,
Harold Zidler or Satine.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.520
The world had been swept up in
a Bohemian revolution, and l had...

05:12.688 --> 05:15.398
...travelled from London to be a part of it.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.694
On the hill near Paris
was the village of Montmartre.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.696
It was not,
as my father said--

05:21.863 --> 05:23.280
A village of sin.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.742
--but the center of
the Bohemian world.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.078
Musicians, painters, writers.

05:29.246 --> 05:33.541
They were known as
the Children of the Revolution.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.503
Yes. I had come to live a penniless
existence. I had come to...

05:37.713 --> 05:40.256
...write about truth, beauty,
freedom...

05:40.424 --> 05:43.718
...and that which l believed in
above all things: love.

05:43.885 --> 05:48.055
Always this ridiculous obsession
with love!

05:48.432 --> 05:50.266
There was only one problem.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.893
I'd never been in love.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.731
Luckily, right at that moment, an unconscious
Argentinean fell through my roof.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.691
[YELLS]

05:59.609 --> 06:02.445
He was joined by a dwarf
dressed as a nun.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.281
How do you do?

06:05.490 --> 06:10.327
My name is Henri Marie Raymond
Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.206
I'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs
rehearsing a play.

06:14.875 --> 06:19.795
A play. Something very modern called
Spectacular Spectacular.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.213
It's set in Switzerland.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.508
Unfortunately, he unconscious Argentinean
suffered from narcolepsy.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.510
TOULOUSE: Perfectly fine
one moment, then suddenly:

06:26.678 --> 06:27.678
[IMITATES SNORING]

06:27.846 --> 06:30.806
...unconscious the next. Ha, ha.
AUDREY: How is he?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.976
Wonderful. The narcoleptic Argentinean
is unconscious.

06:34.144 --> 06:38.147
Therefore the scenario will not be finished
to present to the financier tomorrow.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.735
I still have to finish the music.
We just find someone to read the part.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.155
Where in heaven's name are we going
to find someone to read the role...

06:46.323 --> 06:48.407
...of the young, sensitive
Swiss poet goatherder?

06:48.575 --> 06:52.995
Before I knew it, I was upstairs, standing in
for the unconscious Argentinean.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.873
TOULOUSE [SINGING]:
The hills animate

06:56.041 --> 07:02.213
With the euphonious symphonies
Of descant

07:02.380 --> 07:05.424
Oh, stop!
Stop that insufferable droning!

07:05.634 --> 07:07.426
It's drowning out my words!

07:07.594 --> 07:09.804
Can we just stick
to a little decorative piano?

07:09.971 --> 07:13.265
There seemed to be artistic differences
over Audrey's lyrics to Satie's song.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.518
Don't think a nun would say that
about a hill.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.230
What if he sings, "The hills are vital
intoning the descant"?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.316
"The hills quake and shake--"
No, no, no. "The hills--"

07:22.484 --> 07:26.320
"The hills are incarnate
with symphonic melodies"!

07:28.031 --> 07:29.824
No.
"The hills--" "The hills--"

07:29.991 --> 07:32.284
"The hills--"
"The hills--"

07:32.452 --> 07:35.162
[CHATTERING]

07:39.376 --> 07:42.128
[SINGING]
The hills

07:42.295 --> 07:45.047
Are alive

07:45.215 --> 07:47.883
With the sound of

07:48.051 --> 07:51.387
Music

07:59.062 --> 08:02.857
"The hills are alive with
the sound of music." I love it!

08:03.608 --> 08:05.609
The hills are alive....
With the sound....

08:05.777 --> 08:08.654
[SINGING]
Of music.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.906
It fits perfectly!

08:11.199 --> 08:14.118
With songs they have sung

08:14.286 --> 08:18.914
For a thousand years

08:20.000 --> 08:22.585
[GASPING]

08:22.752 --> 08:24.628
Incandiferous!

08:24.796 --> 08:28.299
Audrey, you should write the show together.
I beg your pardon?

08:28.466 --> 08:31.302
But Toulouse's suggestion that
Audrey and I write together...

08:31.469 --> 08:33.929
...was not what Audrey wanted to hear.
Goodbye!

08:34.764 --> 08:37.390
Here's to your first job in Paris.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.894
Toulouse, Zidler will never agree.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.980
No offense, but have you ever
written anything like this before?

08:43.148 --> 08:46.150
No.
Ah! The boy has talent!

08:46.776 --> 08:48.736
I like him.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.071
Nothing funny. I just like talent.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.867
"The hills are alive
with the sound of music."

08:55.035 --> 08:57.244
With Christian, we can write...

08:57.412 --> 09:00.539
...the truly Bohemian revolutionary show
we always dreamt of.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.208
How will we convince Zidler?

09:02.375 --> 09:03.834
Toulouse had a plan.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.127
Satine.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.838
They would dress me
in the Argentinian's best suit...

09:08.006 --> 09:10.174
...and pass me off
as a famous English writer.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.220
Once Satine heard my poetry, she'd be
astounded and insist to Zidler that...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.055
...I write Spectacular Spectacular.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.058
The only problem was
I kept hearing my father's voice:

09:19.226 --> 09:24.188
You'll end up wasting your life at
the Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer!

09:24.356 --> 09:27.107
I can't write the show for the Moulin Rouge!
Why not?

09:27.275 --> 09:30.236
I don't even know if I am
a true Bohemian revolutionary.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.363
Do you believe in beauty?
Yes.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.031
Freedom?
Yes, of course.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.407
Truth?
Yes.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.076
Love?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.203
Love? Love?

09:39.371 --> 09:41.747
Above all things,
I believe in love.

09:41.957 --> 09:45.292
Love is like oxygen.
Love is a many-splendored thing.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.171
Love lifts us up where we belong.
All you need is love!

09:50.048 --> 09:54.343
See, you can't fool us. You're the voice of
the Children of the Revolution.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.637
We can't be fooled!

09:56.805 --> 10:00.683
Let's drink to the new writer of the world's
first Bohemian revolutionary show!

10:00.850 --> 10:02.643
It was the perfect plan.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.398
I was to audition for Satine
and I would taste my first glass of absinthe.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.525
VOICE [SINGING]:

The conversion of the Moulin Rouge

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.228
This ending is silly.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:59.648
Why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer?

Don't like the ending, my dear Duke?

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:58.290
DUKE:
Why would the courtesan choose...

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:01.793
...a penniless sitar player
over the maharajah...

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:07.132
...who is offering a lifetime of
security? That's real love.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.635
Once the sitar player
has satisfied his lust...

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.221
...he will leave the courtesan
with nothing.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:17.392
I suggest that in the end,
the courtesan choose the maharajah.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.519
But, but.... Sorry.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.357
Sorry, but that ending does not uphold
the Bohemian ideals of...

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.485
...truth, beauty, freedom--

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.071
I don't care about
your ridiculous dogma!

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.574
Why shouldn't the courtesan
choose the maharajah?

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:34.993
Because she doesn't love you!

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.084

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.713

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.819
This ending will be rewritten...

...with the courtesan choosing
the maharajah...

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:17.369
...and without the lovers' secret song.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:24.209
It will be rehearsed in the morning,
ready for the opening tomorrow night.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:27.796

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:35.011
The poor Duke is
being treated appallingly.

These silly writers let their
imaginations run away with them.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.441
Why don't you and I...

...have a little supper?

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.116
Then afterwards...

01:14:57.285 --> 01:15:01.913
...we can let Monsieur Zidler know
how we would prefer the story to end.

You promised.

You promised me
you wouldn't be jealous.

Jealousy! Anger! Betrayal!

01:19:59.879 --> 01:20:02.881
