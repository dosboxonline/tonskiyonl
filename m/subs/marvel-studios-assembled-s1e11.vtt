00:02.419 --> 00:04.671
KAMALA: (DRAMATICALLY)
<i>In times of uncertainty.</i>

00:04.754 --> 00:06.965
BRUNO: <i>Fear.</i>
KAMALA: <i>Darkness.</i>

00:07.048 --> 00:09.009
BRUNO: <i>The world needs a little light.</i>

00:09.634 --> 00:12.679
KAMALA: <i>Some heroes are born.</i>
BRUNO: <i>And others are emboldened.</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:15.473
KAMALA: <i>This is the story of...</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:17.183
BRUNO: <i>Ms. Marvel.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:20.020
KAMALA: <i>And Bruno.</i>
BRUNO: <i>Wait, what?</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:21.938
KAMALA: <i>Huh?</i>
BRUNO: <i>Ms. Marvel and Bruno?</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:24.566
KAMALA: <i>Yeah. I mean,</i>
<i>who helped design the suit?</i>

00:24.649 --> 00:26.818
<i>Who cheered me on</i>
<i>in that training montage?</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:29.988
<i>Who crafted that epic booby-trap</i>
<i>in the finale?</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:31.906
BRUNO: <i>Bruno.</i>
KAMALA: <i>That's right.</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:33.033
(WHISPERS LOUDLY) <i>Bruno.</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:35.618
<i>Now, don't you think it's time</i>
<i>the sidekicks get a little love?</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.163
BRUNO: <i>Okay, but then, what about Nakia?</i>
KAMALA: <i>Sure.</i>

00:38.246 --> 00:42.709
KAMALA: Assembled: The Making of
Ms. Marvel and Bruno and Nakia.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.378
BRUNO: <i>What about Aamir?</i>
KAMALA: <i>Yeah, yeah, Aamir too.</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:46.963
KAMALA: <i>And Zoe.</i>
BRUNO: <i>Muneeba.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:48.757
KAMALA: <i>Yusuf.</i>
BRUNO: <i>What about Auntie Ruby?</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:49.924
KAMALA: <i>The gyro guy.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:52.469
-BRUNO: <i>You know I can't say no to a gyro.</i>
-(KAMALA CHUCKLES)

00:52.552 --> 00:54.888
KAMALA: <i>Kamran?</i>
BRUNO: <i>Ugh, not Kamran.</i>

00:55.388 --> 00:58.141
KAMALA: <i>What, you're fine</i>
<i>with the gyro guy, but not Kamran?</i>

00:58.224 --> 00:59.559
BRUNO: <i>All right, all right.</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:04.355
KAMALA: So, it's Assembled:
The Making of Ms. Marvel and Bruno

01:04.439 --> 01:07.025
and Nakia and Aamir and Zoe
and Muneeba and Yusuf

01:07.108 --> 01:09.694
and the Gyro Guy
and Auntie Ruby and Kamran.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.322
BRUNO: <i>Should we throw in Sana</i>
<i>and the directors</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:13.948
<i>and producers and writers and...</i>

01:14.032 --> 01:15.283
KAMALA: <i>Let's just start the show.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:26.920
FEIGE: <i>Ms. Marvel's</i>
<i>one of the newer characters</i>

01:27.003 --> 01:29.255
<i>that had been brought</i>
<i>into Marvel Publishing.</i>

01:29.672 --> 01:31.758
Marvel's been around for 80-plus years

01:31.841 --> 01:35.261
and most of the heroes we know
have been around for 50-plus years.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.765
<i>So when there are new characters</i>
<i>that come in, it's pretty momentous.</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:42.769
The idea of Kamala Khan
came around 2012-2013.

01:43.853 --> 01:47.065
And I developed that
with G. Willow Wilson.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.110
<i>The entire point of it was</i>
<i>to be able to create a character</i>

01:50.193 --> 01:54.656
<i>that not even just like looked like me</i>
<i>but really was for a fan like me.</i>

01:54.989 --> 01:57.534
<i>You know, I connected to comics</i>
<i>'cause of the X-Men</i>

01:57.617 --> 01:59.410
and the X-Men were very diverse

01:59.494 --> 02:02.330
and, um, it wasn't about brown skin
and white skin.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.125
It was about blue skin,
(CHUCKLES) you know.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.086
It was a different kind of story
but it still told the minority story.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.463
<i>And so, when we had this opportunity</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:14.092
<i>to create a story about a young</i>
<i>Muslim girl, or young South Asian girl,</i>

02:14.175 --> 02:17.011
it was really new and then it wasn't.

02:17.095 --> 02:20.140
Because it was the principles of
what Marvel had always stood for,

02:20.223 --> 02:24.310
<i>which was, creating a character that,</i>
<i>yes, was powerful and fantastic,</i>

02:24.394 --> 02:26.146
<i>but really just like you and me.</i>

02:26.479 --> 02:28.231
(GRUNTING)

02:29.607 --> 02:32.360
I was a fan of the comic books
since the day they came out years ago.

02:32.443 --> 02:35.071
I remember going out
and buying every single variant cover.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.447
<i>It was a watershed moment,</i>

02:36.531 --> 02:38.741
when I could finally see myself
represented in comic books.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.285
That's why I was so drawn to Kamala.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.496
<i>Beyond being a nerd,</i>
<i>beyond being a young girl of color,</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:45.874
<i>she's a teenager and she's going through</i>

02:45.957 --> 02:48.376
all those awkward, ugh, dreadful,
cringeworthy moments.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.671
<i>So, she's just such a relatable character</i>
<i>to anybody reading it.</i>

02:52.380 --> 02:56.801
We always said that
the show needed to be able to exist

02:56.885 --> 02:59.053
without Kamala having superpowers.

02:59.137 --> 03:03.183
<i>We're really focused on building</i>
<i>the stakes of Kamala's personal life.</i>

03:03.266 --> 03:05.560
<i>The stakes of her friendships,</i>
<i>of her family,</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:08.771
and the things that she wants
before she ever gets powers.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.065
Yo, all these spices.

03:11.399 --> 03:14.527
AMANAT: <i>Bilall and Adil are our</i>
<i>episode one and six directors.</i>

03:14.611 --> 03:16.112
Ms. Marvel!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.488
ALL: For life!

03:17.614 --> 03:19.824
They're kicking it off
and they really have brought

03:20.533 --> 03:24.329
an interesting visual style
that is very distinct from the other shows

03:24.412 --> 03:28.333
<i>that also really complements</i>
<i>what the comics are all about.</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:32.253
<i>The stylization is slightly heightened,</i>
<i>the colors are slightly heightened.</i>

03:32.337 --> 03:36.174
<i>As Iman actually said one day on set,</i>
<i>she's like, "I'm living in a comic book."</i>

03:36.799 --> 03:38.051
This was so fun.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.719
When we talked to our agents, we said,

03:39.802 --> 03:43.723
"Hey, yo, is there any... You know,
we're gonna do a Muslim superhero.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.101
For Marvel maybe, yo." And they said,
"Hey, actually, they're doing it."

03:47.185 --> 03:49.520
And that... Right away, we thought...
(GASPS)

03:49.938 --> 03:52.065
-Holy...
-Holy bleep.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.691
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:53.775 --> 03:55.902
That we gotta...
We gotta be part of this.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.279
FALLAH: <i>It was not only that</i>
<i>the comic book was so good,</i>

03:58.363 --> 03:59.781
<i>it just felt so personal to us.</i>

04:00.031 --> 04:04.702
<i>Uh, just relating to the character</i>
<i>of Kamala being between those two worlds,</i>

04:04.786 --> 04:07.080
<i>between the Western world</i>
<i>and the traditional world.</i>

04:07.163 --> 04:08.539
<i>We grew up like that.</i>

04:08.623 --> 04:12.627
<i>And her being a big fan</i>
<i>of all the superheroes,</i>

04:12.710 --> 04:16.923
it reminded of us looking at Hollywood
and looking at the big directors like,

04:17.048 --> 04:19.509
"One day we will be a part of that."

04:19.592 --> 04:21.552
FALLAH: We're living the dream, man.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.429
-Lot of emotion.
-Lot of emotion.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.516
Movie history right there.
In front of our eyes.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.901
I think you're just like, you know,
still kinda whirling from that excitement.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.904
<i>Meera and Sharmeen,</i>
<i>our other two directors...</i>

04:40.029 --> 04:42.282
-That was fun. That was fun.
-WOMAN: Who do you want me to follow then?

04:42.365 --> 04:47.662
...really are fans of the comics as well
and understand what it needs to be,

04:47.745 --> 04:50.498
<i>but also are coming</i>
<i>from their own experience</i>

04:50.581 --> 04:53.543
<i>of being South Asian women</i>
<i>and from two different perspectives.</i>

04:53.626 --> 04:56.004
<i>Sharmeen's Pakistani</i>
<i>and Meera is Indian-American</i>

04:56.087 --> 04:57.171
<i>and she grew up in Jersey.</i>

04:57.255 --> 04:58.840
What came before this was meeting Kamran

04:58.923 --> 05:00.758
and what comes after this
is hanging out with him.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.469
-So you can't dip too low, you know?
-Yeah.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.681
It's just how you feel about things
even though you feel overwhelmed.

05:06.764 --> 05:08.391
It's still all very exciting.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.020
I had been a fan of the comics
since they came out,

05:12.103 --> 05:15.523
namely 'cause a friend of mine
had gifted it to me and she was like,

05:15.606 --> 05:17.400
this girl is like you.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.237
<i>I mean, I grew up in Jersey,</i>
<i>I'm a kid of South Asian immigrants</i>

05:21.321 --> 05:22.572
<i>and I was kinda blown away.</i>

05:22.655 --> 05:24.949
<i>I hadn't really read any piece</i>
<i>of pop culture</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:29.078
that so completely reflected
my childhood experiences.

05:29.245 --> 05:35.585
You are the new, big,
great superhero called...

05:36.294 --> 05:37.545
Called what?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.005
Still thinking about it.

05:39.088 --> 05:43.009
Ms. Marvel matters
because she is a superhero

05:43.092 --> 05:46.888
for so many people
beyond the Marvel fandom.

05:47.597 --> 05:52.727
<i>She represents something</i>
<i>that we've never seen on screen before.</i>

05:52.977 --> 05:55.813
<i>A brown Muslim female superhero.</i>

05:56.230 --> 05:59.609
And when young girls
around the world watch her,

05:59.692 --> 06:04.822
they will see a reflection of themselves
on screen that they've never seen before.

06:04.947 --> 06:10.703
We may not know who this girl is,
or understand her motivations,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.999
but we owe it to her as much as anyone,

06:15.458 --> 06:19.253
to let her show us in her own time.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.964
SHARMEEN: <i>And so,</i>
<i>as a Pakistani filmmaker,</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:25.718
<i>it is a dream to be able</i>
<i>to bring Ms. Marvel to life.</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:29.889
VELLANI: <i>The way it happened is,</i>
<i>I was like,</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:31.265
it was on the last day of school,

06:31.349 --> 06:34.143
so I literally got cast
on the last day of high school,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.646
and, um,
I'm hanging out with my friends

06:36.729 --> 06:38.147
<i>and casting director called.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:40.525
She's like,
"We need you on a call right..."

06:40.608 --> 06:42.443
I'm like, "I can't, I'm busy."

06:42.819 --> 06:45.363
<i>And then, she's like,</i>
<i>"I just sent you the link. Get on."</i>

06:45.446 --> 06:47.824
<i>And, I download the app,</i>
<i>I get on it, I open my phone,</i>

06:47.907 --> 06:51.577
<i>it's Kevin Feige's face. All the producers</i>
<i>and the directors on the call.</i>

06:51.661 --> 06:54.664
My friends are watching me from the car,
they don't know anything.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.667
I'm roaming around her driveway
and then Kevin's like, saying,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.461
"It was unanimous," like,
"We want you to be Ms. Marvel."

07:00.545 --> 07:03.172
And I was like, "'Kay."

07:03.256 --> 07:05.007
-Yeah.
-EL ARBI: Hey, Iman, how do you feel?

07:05.091 --> 07:08.219
-Really cool. I'm a superhero.
-Yeah? Yeah. That's supercool.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.014
BERGER: <i>Iman is Kamala Khan.</i>
<i>She was absolutely meant to play her.</i>

07:12.098 --> 07:13.808
<i>And we saw that a year and a half ago,</i>

07:13.891 --> 07:17.186
<i>the first time we brought her</i>
<i>to LA for that screen test.</i>

07:17.311 --> 07:20.857
I mean, it was just so clear she knew
who this character was to her core

07:21.107 --> 07:23.818
<i>and she embodied that completely.</i>

07:24.318 --> 07:29.490
Look at us, just a couple of superheroes
teaming up. Solving puzzles.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.995
You know, we kinda forget where
the character in the comic ends

07:34.078 --> 07:35.913
<i>and Iman starts, at this point.</i>

07:35.997 --> 07:36.998
MAN: Yeah.

07:37.081 --> 07:41.294
You know, the parallels between me
and Kamala are like, like this now.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.129
We're like... We are so much alike,

07:43.212 --> 07:44.964
and I have so much love
for the character,

07:45.047 --> 07:46.591
<i>which is why I auditioned for it.</i>

07:46.674 --> 07:50.052
<i>Like, I didn't wanna be an actor,</i>
<i>but, because it was Ms. Marvel</i>

07:50.136 --> 07:53.139
<i>and I loved her comics for years,</i>
<i>it was like, I had no choice.</i>

07:53.222 --> 07:55.391
<i>I would like...</i>
<i>I know my ten-year-old self</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:57.435
<i>would hate me if I didn't audition.</i>

07:57.518 --> 08:00.146
It's so cool. (CHUCKLES)

08:00.605 --> 08:02.315
-(ROARS)
-Powers.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.234
-You're gonna get activated.
-Her powers just got introduced.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.195
And Bruno doesn't know what's going on.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.362
Neither does Kamala.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.780
So we just dance.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.033
DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, go.

08:12.116 --> 08:15.119
VELLANI: <i>My first day was</i>
<i>in full Captain Marvel costume.</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:17.371
<i>Like, the original one.</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:19.999
<i>The one that</i>
<i>Brie Larson's stunt double wore.</i>

08:20.082 --> 08:22.627
You know, the first thing you film
in a superhero costume,

08:22.752 --> 08:24.754
that's pretty insane.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.799
MAN: Iman, what do you think so far?

08:28.883 --> 08:32.428
It's the greatest day of my life.
This is so cool. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

08:33.137 --> 08:35.139
I don't know. I'm very happy.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.644
And in a bit we're gonna be
in the full helmet of my costume

08:39.727 --> 08:42.897
and then I won't be able to smile
so I'm getting it out right now.

08:42.980 --> 08:46.692
VELLANI: <i>Kamala Khan is this passionate,</i>
<i>creative, high school kid</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:50.363
<i>who just wants to find simplicity</i>
<i>in her life through, you know,</i>

08:50.446 --> 08:52.406
<i>this fantastical world of the Avengers.</i>

08:52.490 --> 08:56.244
She represents everything about
nerd culture that there is, you know.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.498
When she gets powers for the first time
or when she meets Avengers,

09:00.581 --> 09:03.334
<i>it's like, you root for her</i>
<i>because you see that excitement</i>

09:03.417 --> 09:05.878
<i>and that fascination in her eyes</i>
<i>and it's...</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:09.006
<i>It just makes you so happy</i>
<i>and you wanna follow her story.</i>

09:09.298 --> 09:11.300
<i>She is a fan just like us.</i>

09:11.509 --> 09:12.635
I got this, right?

09:15.846 --> 09:16.847
Totally.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.439
We're at Circle Q. It's my humble abode.
It's where I work.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.400
<i>And tonight we're shooting</i>
<i>a bunch of stuff</i>

09:27.483 --> 09:31.529
<i>with Rish and Iman and all of them</i>
<i>coming back from the party.</i>

09:31.612 --> 09:34.365
-I'll be driving the Porsche from now on.
-No.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.992
I did it. That was great.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.827
LINTZ: <i>Iman and I have been through</i>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.955
<i>over a month and a half of rehearsals</i>
<i>prior to filming.</i>

09:41.038 --> 09:42.999
-(MIMICKING HULK) I'm Bruce Banner.
-Hulk smash.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.917
Hulk smash, Hulk smash.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.712
<i>I knew it was gonna be great, because</i>

09:47.795 --> 09:50.339
<i>right from the start,</i>
<i>we had such a great bond</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:52.633
<i>and chemistry and just getting to know her</i>

09:52.717 --> 09:54.802
<i>and become really good friends with her</i>
<i>has been amazing.</i>

09:54.885 --> 09:57.722
Kamala and Bruno's relationship
is a classic

09:57.805 --> 09:59.807
friendship since you were a kid.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.642
<i>When I think about that friendship,</i>

10:01.726 --> 10:04.979
<i>it's the kind of friendship that most</i>
<i>people aspire to have in their lifetimes.</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:06.564
Ms. Marvel.

10:07.815 --> 10:08.899
Ms. Marvel.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.776
No, I have the mask though.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.486
But I am her.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.405
We're all so similar to our characters

10:14.488 --> 10:19.035
that it feels like the dynamic that Nakia,
Bruno and Kamala have.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.287
I don't think I'm as stiff as Matt.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.205
-You know, this is how he moves.
-I'm loose now. I'm loose.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.498
I had a day of practice, you know?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.375
Yeah. Come on, man.
You might be just as stiff.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.585
See?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.546
And you're gonna be carried in.
Don't get a big head.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.090
FLETCHER: <i>Matt and I are poking</i>
<i>at each other all the time.</i>

10:33.174 --> 10:34.550
<i>And Iman and I are really close.</i>

10:34.634 --> 10:37.887
(CHUCKLING) <i>I'm like, "Bruno.</i>
<i>It's really, really fun."</i>

10:37.970 --> 10:40.306
Nakia. I'm so excited to introduce
to the screen as well.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.559
<i>She's a hijabi.</i>
<i>She's also Muslim-American like Kamala is</i>

10:43.768 --> 10:46.062
<i>and they have different relationships</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:48.731
to their families, to their friends,
to their communities.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.525
And yet, the core of who they are
is what bonds them together.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.279
FLETCHER: <i>She breaks a lot of</i>
<i>the stereotypes for hijabi girls,</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
which, I loved immediately
about the character.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.159
-We are campaigning.
-Loving it. Campaigning.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.662
-For Nakia. Vote for Nakia.
-Please, y'all.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.665
-Vote me into the mosque.
-(CHUCKLING)

11:06.582 --> 11:09.543
I think that what's so amazing
about this series

11:09.627 --> 11:15.424
is that everybody will be able
to see themselves in somebody in the show.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.636
<i>Everybody is going to be able to connect</i>
<i>to every character.</i>

11:18.719 --> 11:20.012
<i>That's so incredible.</i>

11:20.096 --> 11:21.514
We're actually getting our own
spin-off show.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.350
SHAIKH: Yeah, we are.
It's called Brun-Aamir.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.519
(ALL LAUGHING)

11:26.602 --> 11:31.899
We have built this, like... This family.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.401
FLETCHER: Hey, fun.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.363
LINTZ: Nice picture, nice picture.
Yeah. We're all love.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.157
-FLETCHER: That was such an aggressive...
-Yeah! Yeah, we all.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.242
Yeah!

11:41.367 --> 11:44.954
You know, I'm the millennial of the group,
and they're all Gen Z.

11:45.121 --> 11:51.877
Fifty cents a bag? That's a deal.
Only in Jersey. Only in Jersey.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.004
<i>They make jokes</i>
<i>that I don't understand,</i>

11:54.088 --> 11:56.048
<i>that I need them to brief me on,</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:59.593
or send me that TikTok,
so that I'm in on the joke or whatever.

12:00.219 --> 12:04.140
<i>I kinda feel like sometimes</i>
<i>I'm forcing myself to</i>

12:04.473 --> 12:06.183
<i>be as young or cool as them.</i>

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
So, I'm just like,
let me take a couple of steps back

12:08.477 --> 12:10.396
and let them enjoy their time.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.316
And then I'll come back in
when they miss me.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.361
What the heck?
She just said I was 40 years old.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
That's rude.

12:20.948 --> 12:21.949
Is it the beard?

12:22.783 --> 12:23.784
Yeah.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.745
It sounds cheesy.
A lot of people will be like,

12:25.828 --> 12:29.123
"Yeah, these people are my family,"
but I have never meant that more.

12:29.206 --> 12:33.919
<i>With COVID and having to be in a bubble,</i>
<i>it really was such a bonding experience.</i>

12:35.629 --> 12:39.175
Fun fact. We basically all live
in the same apartment building.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.595
LINTZ: <i>It's like a college dorm.</i>
<i>And we describe it like a college dorm</i>

12:42.678 --> 12:44.972
'cause we're all so close
and we hang out every weekend.

12:45.055 --> 12:47.808
VELLANI: <i>Right down the hallway,</i>
<i>I've got Saagar who plays my brother.</i>

12:47.892 --> 12:51.020
Right underneath me is Laurel,
who plays Zoe...

12:51.103 --> 12:53.105
MARSDEN: <i>I cannot be more thankful</i>

12:53.355 --> 12:55.357
that we all came together
on such an amazing project.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.567
(ALL LAUGH)

13:03.032 --> 13:05.868
Initially, I was very nervous,
and even now, you know,

13:05.951 --> 13:10.122
I keep wanting that confirmation
and the reassurance from my director,

13:10.206 --> 13:12.082
<i>from the cameraman,</i>
<i>from my co-stars, you know.</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:14.210
<i>And I keep saying, "Was that all right?</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:16.253
<i>So they keep asking,</i>
<i>"Why do you keep asking?"</i>

13:16.337 --> 13:18.756
And I say, "Because I come
from a different part of the world,

13:18.839 --> 13:21.008
"and even though
I've been acting for 30 years,

13:21.091 --> 13:23.219
"and over there,
this is the first time I'm doing it here."

13:23.302 --> 13:24.970
You are brave, my son.

13:27.014 --> 13:31.852
Because you have chosen family. <i>Mashallah.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:41.028
And the man who chooses family
is never alone.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.198
It's fantastic, because I get to be
a part of something

13:44.824 --> 13:50.037
that unwinds on a scale hitherto something
that I have never been a part of.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.874
Wait, wait.
The best is yet to come. Ta-da!

13:54.124 --> 13:57.419
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)

13:57.837 --> 14:01.966
Yusuf, Muneeba have this lovely dynamic.

14:02.049 --> 14:06.762
And he's always softer with Kamala.
Muneeba is harder with Kamala.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.138
<i>But I think it's one of those things</i>

14:08.222 --> 14:10.224
<i>where, you know,</i>
<i>you get those teachers who say,</i>

14:10.307 --> 14:13.477
<i>"I was tough on you</i>
<i>because I knew you could be really good."</i>

14:13.561 --> 14:16.355
<i>And Muneeba knows this kid's potential.</i>

14:16.438 --> 14:18.607
<i>She knows there's something special there.</i>

14:18.899 --> 14:22.361
<i>And she still wants to protect her</i>
<i>from all that.</i>

14:22.444 --> 14:25.406
You know, if you come
to that part of the world ever,

14:25.489 --> 14:30.369
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, or wherever.
We were all one country at one point.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.956
<i>It's that mayhem, that craziness,</i>

14:34.081 --> 14:37.167
<i>lots of food, lots of laughter,</i>
<i>lots of fighting.</i>

14:38.252 --> 14:41.589
It's in my blood. (CHUCKLES)
I don't even have to incorporate it.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.757
It's just there. It's there.

14:43.841 --> 14:49.555
So you want to go to a party, at night?
Is this a joke?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
You do trust me, right?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.434
No. I don't trust you.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.978
-Of course she does.
-No, I don't trust her.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.563
She does.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.442
DIRECTOR: And three, two, one, go!

15:01.567 --> 15:04.695
VELLANI: <i>This is our</i>
<i>first introduction to Kamran.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:07.281
<i>It was freezing. I mean,</i>
<i>they'd done everything possible</i>

15:07.364 --> 15:08.741
to make me comfortable.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.535
The pool is heated,
and it feels like a hot tub,

15:11.619 --> 15:13.913
and there is also a hot tub,
in case I needed it,

15:13.996 --> 15:16.415
<i>which I didn't,</i>
<i>'cause the pool was so hot.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:18.417
They're going again.
Go away. You're going again.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.543
LINTZ: Why?

15:20.377 --> 15:22.296
-They're what you call...
-Hey, this guy's the man.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.715
-This guy is the man. We gotta go, though.
-Don't. There they go. Run off.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.678
VELLANI: <i>Kamala is like... She's kind of</i>
<i>been alone for a lot of high school.</i>

15:29.762 --> 15:31.221
<i>She's been around a lot of people,</i>

15:31.305 --> 15:34.141
<i>but there's never been someone</i>
<i>who fully understands her,</i>

15:34.224 --> 15:36.060
<i>or, you know, what she goes through,</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:39.855
<i>and there's always been that little,</i>
<i>like, sense of loneliness,</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:41.607
<i>and a chip on her shoulder, 'cause like,</i>

15:41.690 --> 15:45.319
<i>"Oh, I'm Brown. I have to, you know,</i>
<i>act differently in school</i>

15:45.402 --> 15:47.613
<i>"when I'm not around Brown people."</i>

15:48.030 --> 15:50.324
<i>And so, enter Kamran.</i>

15:51.116 --> 15:55.245
This charismatic, attractive...
Don't tell Rish I said that...

15:55.371 --> 16:00.292
(CHUCKLES) ...guy who just lets Kamala,
you know, be loose.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.919
BOTH: <i>Mashallah.</i>

16:02.127 --> 16:04.129
-What does that mean?
-Damn!

16:12.513 --> 16:14.932
I am in the Red Dagger lair

16:15.182 --> 16:19.436
which is the secret hideout
of the Order of Red Daggers,

16:19.603 --> 16:24.233
<i>and this is where Waleed,</i>
<i>and Kareem, the Red Dagger,</i>

16:24.316 --> 16:29.363
<i>are meeting with Iman</i>
<i>and talking to her about her powers,</i>

16:29.446 --> 16:30.864
and connecting the dots for her.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.368
For hundreds of years, that scarf
has protected the identity of warriors

16:34.451 --> 16:36.662
willing to put on the mantle
of The Red Dagger.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.958
<i>You access The Red Dagger lair</i>
<i>through this Chinese restaurant,</i>

16:41.041 --> 16:44.169
<i>and its kitchen, and the walk down,</i>
<i>and then the reveal</i>

16:44.503 --> 16:46.839
<i>that takes place once you walk in.</i>

16:46.922 --> 16:49.133
It's really something very special,

16:49.216 --> 16:52.678
and when Iman and Aramis
walk through it for the first time,

16:52.761 --> 16:57.349
they had this moment where it really
does look like a secret lair.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.059
RED DAGGER: Roll with the Red Dagger.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.603
That's the way to open your eyes.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.857
KAMALA: Red Dagger.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.652
KNIGHT: <i>In the script, it says, you know,</i>
<i>Kareem, he pushes back the oven,</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:11.697
<i>and it goes back,</i>
<i>and it's a trap wall and whatever.</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:15.159
<i>When we went to rehearse, they didn't</i>
<i>tell us at all what the set was all about.</i>

17:15.909 --> 17:17.411
<i>So when I got there, I expected, you know,</i>

17:17.494 --> 17:19.246
<i>I'd push the oven</i>
<i>and it'll go a couple feet.</i>

17:19.329 --> 17:21.081
<i>We'll stop. We'll move to the next set.</i>

17:21.165 --> 17:24.168
But it ended up being
a fully practical set.

17:24.251 --> 17:28.047
So, we push on this oven,
and it opens this trap wall

17:28.130 --> 17:33.177
<i>that goes back 15, 20 feet into this</i>
<i>huge, grand, blue walkway.</i>

17:33.260 --> 17:36.638
I mean, in the middle of rehearsal,
me and Iman literally stopped,

17:36.722 --> 17:40.142
and we're just like, "What the hell?"
Like kids in a candy shop.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.727
(SOFTLY) That is the coolest thing ever.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.229
It was not hard to feel
like a Red Dagger that day.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.650
(GRUNTING)

17:48.859 --> 17:53.864
You know, Kamala came looking for answers,
and she ends up finding this 17-year-old,

17:53.947 --> 17:57.534
and in the script,
it's with his sexy hair.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.204
So, that tells you everything.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.123
Aramis really threw himself
into this role.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.709
<i>He put the Red Dagger costume on,</i>
<i>and he was in.</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:08.295
<i>And also, you know, he happens to be</i>
<i>very talented at martial arts,</i>

18:08.378 --> 18:09.671
<i>so that was very helpful.</i>

18:10.255 --> 18:12.508
Yeah, I was trained in Wushu
for like five years.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.219
The show I was on before this
was like a martial arts show.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.096
<i>It was perfect for Red Dagger.</i>

18:18.055 --> 18:21.100
VELLANI: <i>We gotta do lot of our</i>
<i>stunts together, which is so great,</i>

18:21.183 --> 18:23.602
<i>because a lot of the times, you know,</i>

18:23.685 --> 18:26.271
I'm like doing stunts
with the actor's stunt double,

18:26.355 --> 18:29.608
or you know, other actors are doing
with my stunt double.

18:29.691 --> 18:33.070
We can't really have those action moments
together all the time.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.240
<i>But, for the most part, Aramis</i>
<i>and I have been doing our stunts together,</i>

18:36.323 --> 18:38.700
<i>and it just adds to the dynamic.</i>

18:39.993 --> 18:42.579
AMANAT: <i>Kamala's got a lot of</i>
<i>love interests, you know?</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:44.998
So, we wanted to make sure
that when she met another boy,

18:45.082 --> 18:48.752
it wasn't going to be just about that.
It was about her meeting someone

18:48.919 --> 18:50.921
<i>who works really hard</i>
<i>to be good at what he does.</i>

18:51.004 --> 18:54.174
<i>He doesn't have the powers that she does.</i>
<i>He trained really hard.</i>

18:55.134 --> 18:58.971
And to show her that there are other,
you know, brown heroes like her.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.598
<i>And, that she can do it,</i>
<i>and do it in her own way,</i>

19:01.682 --> 19:05.144
<i>and it doesn't have to look like</i>
<i>what the Avengers look like.</i>

19:05.727 --> 19:07.104
Our function is simple.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.274
To protect our people
from the threats of the unseen.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.360
KNIGHT: <i>Having a character like Waleed</i>
<i>to be able to fall back on,</i>

19:13.443 --> 19:16.405
and to be able to create
that relationship with Farhan,

19:16.488 --> 19:19.783
who is an amazing guy, by the way,
amazing actor, has been great.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.870
<i>Just being in his presence</i>
<i>was actually amazing.</i>

19:22.953 --> 19:27.040
He's a producer, director, actor in India,

19:27.124 --> 19:30.752
and it's just been fabulous to work
with him on this project.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.173
I used to watch his movies
when I was a kid, with my parents.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.801
They were like the few Bollywood movies
I actually enjoyed watching.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.554
So, it's pretty crazy.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.933
Your humanity links you to
the matter of this world.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.643
It makes your abilities unique.

19:48.937 --> 19:53.775
Kamala is made aware of certain powers
that she possesses,

19:53.859 --> 19:57.779
is made aware of the power
of an individual, so to speak,

19:57.863 --> 20:00.824
<i>and how it takes one person really</i>
<i>to change the course of destiny.</i>

20:01.033 --> 20:02.701
<i>That's something</i>
<i>she learns from Waleed.</i>

20:02.784 --> 20:07.289
So it's a mentor-like character
to Kamala.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.666
And yeah, that's what I'm doing here.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.294
Apart from some really kick-ass action.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.762
BUCHA: <i>It's so fun playing a mean girl.</i>
<i>It's just the best thing.</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:23.472
The consequence of that

20:23.555 --> 20:26.808
is that I've become really a nice person
in my real life,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.435
<i>because I get it all out on set,</i>

20:28.518 --> 20:32.648
<i>and there's a lot of, sort of,</i>
<i>grunting, and roaring,</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:35.609
and all of that anger

in the hotel room.

<i>And then they gave me</i>
<i>a bunch of little buildings, like, toys.</i>

23:46.383 --> 23:49.594
So I had to sit there in quarantine
and I would like, take my camera,

32:08.051 --> 32:10.261
jingling noises, as they move along
down the street.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.430
There's always these chains I hear
at the bottom.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.015
You can see down here.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.102
You know, that's kind of a feature.

32:23.691 --> 32:27.153
AKHTAR: <i>I must admit</i>
<i>that when I was first told</i>

32:27.236 --> 32:30.490
that Karachi is being recreated
in Bangkok,

32:30.657 --> 32:34.494
there was a little question mark
that was hanging over my head

32:34.577 --> 32:36.537
as to how is this gonna happen.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.958
<i>And from the moment</i>
<i>that we walked on to the set,</i>

32:40.124 --> 32:42.835
<i>I mean, it just feels...</i>
<i>I mean, it feels like you're there.</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.629
It's absolutely fantastic.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.385
GLASS: <i>With Jersey City and Karachi,</i>

32:50.551 --> 32:53.346
you know, we're kind of enhancing it.
We're turning up the volume a little bit

32:53.429 --> 32:55.431
<i>with color and certain things.</i>

32:55.640 --> 32:59.435
Local-owned. Local blood, sweat and tears
is what brings out the flavor.

33:00.019 --> 33:03.189
You're not gonna see Najaf selling out.
I haven't changed my menu in 14 years.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.566
GLASS: <i>There's all kinds of layers to this</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:07.360
<i>that we've been going through</i>

33:07.443 --> 33:09.779
<i>to create Kamala's world.</i>

33:10.029 --> 33:13.116
(WHISPERING) We're doing this.
There's Kamala.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.411
GLASS: <i>Even bedsheets, would she really</i>
<i>have those kind of bedsheets?</i>

33:16.494 --> 33:18.079
<i>Would she have these curtains in her room?</i>

33:18.162 --> 33:19.747
Will the curtains be from her mother?

33:19.872 --> 33:22.542
'Cause her mother probably told her,
"Here's your curtains,"

33:22.667 --> 33:24.502
you know, versus her picking them.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.673
<i>But there's certain things in her room</i>
<i>that she'd get the choice of picking.</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:33.052
<i>And it really shows her personality</i>
<i>and she's a huge fan of the Avengers.</i>

33:33.594 --> 33:37.682
The world of Kamala is this actually,
grounded world of Jersey.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.309
So, although
it is a comic book adaptation

33:40.393 --> 33:42.520
and you have really the humor
and the comic book style

33:42.603 --> 33:43.604
and you're in her world,

33:43.688 --> 33:47.150
<i>we wanted to have a sort of,</i>
<i>grounded physicality</i>

33:47.233 --> 33:50.361
<i>that you really feel you're there</i>
<i>on the streets with her</i>

33:50.528 --> 33:54.657
<i>so that it gives a big contrast</i>
<i>once the super powers kicks in</i>

33:54.741 --> 33:58.244
<i>and once, you know, the MCU kicks in,</i>
<i>you have this difference.</i>

33:58.327 --> 34:03.207
And this is also a way of making
our show very distinct

34:03.291 --> 34:05.918
<i>from the other superhero movies</i>
<i>or TV shows.</i>

34:11.174 --> 34:13.134
The amount of detail they put in
to all these sets.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.970
The amount of stuff they built.
Like, they built a whole Circle Q.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.306
<i>They built literally the Khan house.</i>

34:18.389 --> 34:21.267
<i>They built part of Coles Academic High.</i>
<i>They built so much.</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:22.435
I don't know what to say.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.770
(SCOFFS)

34:24.437 --> 34:25.646
(CHUCKLES) You say yes.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.982
And then you give me a fist bump.

34:34.363 --> 34:36.449
I kept thinking this is
the weirdest high school

34:36.532 --> 34:38.451
that I've ever seen
or I've ever created. (CHUCKLES)

34:38.534 --> 34:40.453
'Cause I've done
a couple of high schools before

34:40.953 --> 34:44.123
<i>and this one's like, definitely unique</i>
<i>with the color palette.</i>

34:44.207 --> 34:47.335
EL ARBI: <i>We love colors, you know.</i>
<i>Everything's very, very colorful.</i>

34:47.418 --> 34:50.963
So they came up with the idea of having
the high school pink.

34:51.589 --> 34:53.841
-Let's go for it. Let's go <i>loco.</i>
-Everything pink?

34:53.966 --> 34:55.927
EL ARBI: <i>They were like, "All pink."</i>

34:56.010 --> 34:57.512
<i>And the lockers' really blue</i>

34:57.595 --> 34:59.097
-and that's gotta pop.
-And green floors.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.390
GLASS: <i>That's pulled from</i>
<i>the actual comic.</i>

35:01.474 --> 35:04.227
The comic has pink walls
and this, kind of, pale blue.

35:04.352 --> 35:08.231
EL ARBI: <i>Sana was the first one to say,</i>
<i>"This is great, I really like the colors."</i>

35:08.314 --> 35:10.691
<i>And we were like</i>
<i>this is visually the best thing</i>

35:10.775 --> 35:12.568
BOTH: "We've ever done in our lives."

35:12.652 --> 35:14.445
EL ARBI: We already have
a great first take

35:14.612 --> 35:18.074
and now we're seeing
if we can maybe get it even better.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.202
The palette of it is in Kamala's world.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.954
<i>If you look at her room,</i>

35:23.037 --> 35:25.665
<i>you look at the dusty room</i>
<i>in her grandmother's house,</i>

35:25.790 --> 35:27.834
<i>it has the same color</i>
<i>as the high school, actually.</i>

35:27.917 --> 35:32.922
<i>I feel like that's a thread</i>
<i>that goes through. It's part of her world.</i>

35:34.132 --> 35:37.176
Camelia, glad you're not bruising
from that dodgeball incident.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.555
BHASIN: <i>I never went to high school</i>
<i>in the US,</i>

35:40.638 --> 35:42.140
so, for me, that was really challenging,

35:42.223 --> 35:44.475
trying to understand
the American high school experience.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.521
<i>I didn't want to fall into</i>
<i>any of those '90s tropes</i>

35:48.604 --> 35:51.607
<i>of what high school kids</i>
<i>are expected to be</i>

35:51.691 --> 35:53.651
<i>and I wanted them to be</i>

35:54.026 --> 35:56.779
sort of, more encompassing
of the world around them.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.448
<i>You wanna be true culturally</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:02.910
<i>to what you're saying</i>
<i>about the culture on both sides,</i>

36:02.994 --> 36:06.789
<i>Pakistani street culture</i>
<i>as well as American school culture.</i>

36:06.914 --> 36:08.583
I like your necklace.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.959
KAMALA: Thanks.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.211
It's actually my name in Arabic.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.174
There are just so many tones and shades
to this whole show

36:16.257 --> 36:18.551
and that's really, to me,
been the fun of it.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.304
You're a girl divided. Right?

36:21.679 --> 36:23.139
"Is she there or is she there?"
"Where's Kamala?"

36:23.222 --> 36:25.141
No one knows. No one knows.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.102
And I know, I know fantasy is fun.

36:28.561 --> 36:32.523
But right now, we gotta
pull it together and join reality.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.819
(CLASSICAL INDIAN MUSIC PLAYING)

36:41.324 --> 36:43.701
SCHROFF: <i>It's our son's wedding,</i>
<i>and as is</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:47.580
with all big fat Indian weddings,
they really do live up to that name.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.585
We don't have small weddings.
That's not what we're known for.

36:52.877 --> 36:57.381
So it just felt very specific
to the culture and felt really right.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.507
It's so much fun.

36:58.591 --> 37:05.306
<i>This idea of the specific New Jersey</i>
<i>middle-class Bollywood wedding.</i>

37:05.389 --> 37:06.849
What's the actual point of this?

37:07.183 --> 37:09.977
Oh, uh, well, it brings
fortitude to your marriage

37:10.061 --> 37:12.313
so that every time you clash
you become closer.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.689
-Is that actually true?
-Who knows?

37:13.773 --> 37:17.401
BHASIN: <i>And you want people</i>
<i>to be able to breathe and have some fun.</i>

37:17.485 --> 37:19.528
It's super comfortable
trying to dance in this.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.448
<i>Like, it's pants and not a skirt,</i>
<i>which is shocking.</i>

37:22.531 --> 37:25.534
I definitely feel fancy.
I definitely feel like I'm at my wedding.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.994
<i>I wore one of these.</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:31.374
LINTZ: <i>It really immerses you</i>
<i>in the world of Aamir's wedding</i>

37:31.499 --> 37:32.833
and it really helps.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.712
MENON: <i>Story-wise, it was really important</i>
<i>that this dance was about Kamala</i>

37:36.796 --> 37:39.006
and her family and friends
coming together,

37:39.090 --> 37:43.177
<i>and her feeling close with these people</i>
<i>and this community that she loves.</i>

37:43.427 --> 37:45.096
(SINGING) <i>Na, na, na, na, na, na</i>

37:45.388 --> 37:47.598
Click. (VOCALIZES)

37:48.224 --> 37:51.269
SCHROFF: <i>Many, many people learn</i>
<i>many different dances.</i>

37:51.477 --> 37:53.813
<i>The last big fat Indian wedding I went to,</i>
<i>there was</i>

37:53.938 --> 37:56.732
seven to ten dances by...

37:56.899 --> 38:00.444
<i>You know, the bridesmaids will do one</i>
<i>and the parents will do one.</i>

38:00.528 --> 38:02.363
<i>I want to get my steps right.</i>

38:02.446 --> 38:04.740
So even if it doesn't have the finesse
that you do...

38:05.199 --> 38:08.327
then I will play with my expression.
Because I need to flirt with her.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.162
-But, exactly.
-I want that.

38:10.329 --> 38:14.458
We always wanted to make it feel very real
and very authentic

38:14.542 --> 38:17.044
<i>and at the same time have really fun</i>
<i>and good steps.</i>

38:17.128 --> 38:20.840
<i>But the fun thing about weddings</i>
<i>is when the family really gets involved.</i>

38:20.923 --> 38:23.801
I've been a dancer in my youth.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.011
(CHUCKLES)

38:25.094 --> 38:30.224
So I've done eight to ten years
of classical Indian dance.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.978
I have done a full-on Bollywood dance
in a Bollywood movie before.

38:34.061 --> 38:37.064
Drop it down, left leg.
Drop it down, right leg.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.650
KAPUR: <i>I'm from the land</i>
<i>where this stuff happens</i>

38:39.734 --> 38:42.695
and I'm embarrassed and ashamed to say,
no, I've never.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.780
<i>But, my characters that I've played,</i>

38:44.864 --> 38:47.450
<i>I've never had to do it.</i>
<i>Occasionally, once in a while.</i>

38:47.533 --> 38:50.286
But they've made it really easy for me
because they must have said,

38:50.369 --> 38:53.122
"Let's not waste production time
trying to teach this man."

38:53.205 --> 38:54.665
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.918
To me, it's such an opportunity to share

38:58.085 --> 39:02.882
such a significant part of a culture
that I certainly grew up around.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.593
Somehow they have more
and more energy every take.

39:05.676 --> 39:09.430
I don't know. I think that's what dancing
does to people.

39:09.513 --> 39:13.434
It makes them joyous
and that's what we're feeling.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.644
When I heard about dance rehearsals,

39:15.728 --> 39:17.980
I had no idea
that I would be a part of it.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.649
<i>Then, of course, you know, I get the call.</i>

39:20.900 --> 39:23.444
<i>I come in, I'm like</i>
<i>I'll probably just be in the background.</i>

39:23.569 --> 39:25.821
<i>I'm in the front. So, you know...</i>

39:25.905 --> 39:26.947
We're gonna feature you.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.033
Just 'cause you didn't think
you would be in it.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.117
Featuring Bruno.

39:30.201 --> 39:34.580
<i>The person who is possibly</i>
<i>the worst dancer you will ever see.</i>

39:36.290 --> 39:38.584
<i>I feel exhilarated.</i>
<i>That was a good first take.</i>

39:38.667 --> 39:40.336
FLETCHER: That was a lot of energy
just now.

39:40.419 --> 39:42.296
LINTZ: It was. I didn't know we were
gonna go all the way through with it.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.966
Started with high energy,
some things went wrong.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.762
-But that's why we're doing another take.
-LINTZ: Nothing went wrong.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.514
I think I almost bumped into
three people, but it's fine.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.393
SPRINGER: <i>Saagar and I go back.</i>
<i>We have been friends for years</i>

39:55.518 --> 39:57.812
and it was easy to have chemistry.

39:57.895 --> 40:01.148
<i>And he's also a great guy.</i>
<i>So, he's fun to play with.</i>

40:01.232 --> 40:03.901
Tyesha was modest,
but Travina was twerking at the end there.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.112
Yeah, I was, yeah.
Travina will give you a little...

40:06.195 --> 40:07.238
Whoo-hoo.

40:07.405 --> 40:11.992
Watching the dancing has been really cool
and seeing the decorations for the wedding

40:12.076 --> 40:14.537
<i>because there's been so much build-up</i>
<i>to the wedding</i>

40:14.662 --> 40:18.374
and seeing what it is and going through it
and now the fight scenes, it's...

40:20.876 --> 40:25.047
There was two components to what we had
to prepare for with that wedding sequence.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.258
One was the big Bollywood dance number,

40:27.425 --> 40:30.052
<i>but in addition to that,</i>
<i>we also had to prepare for, you know,</i>

40:30.136 --> 40:33.347
<i>the climactic fight sequences</i>
<i>between Kamala and the villains.</i>

40:33.597 --> 40:35.808
<i>And so both of those things</i>
<i>are happening back-to-back</i>

40:35.891 --> 40:37.476
<i>within the course of this wedding.</i>

40:37.601 --> 40:41.939
So, yeah, our time spent
in shooting out that set

40:42.022 --> 40:45.609
and that whole sequence
had our attention in two different places,

40:45.693 --> 40:46.694
dancing and fighting,

40:46.777 --> 40:48.362
which I think is pretty awesome.
(CHUCKLES)

40:54.160 --> 40:55.828
-MAN: Oh, sorry.
-I didn't know we were doing presents.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.954
(LAUGHS)

40:57.037 --> 40:58.622
-I was like, where'd that come from?
-MAN: So sorry. Sorry.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.668
MENON: <i>Dancing and choreography</i>
<i>and stunt choreography,</i>

41:03.002 --> 41:04.837
<i>it's a little bit of the same</i>
<i>kind of beast.</i>

41:04.920 --> 41:07.047
<i>You have to do a lot of planning</i>
<i>that goes into it.</i>

41:07.131 --> 41:10.342
<i>You have to know the exact steps</i>
<i>and the exact placement of people</i>

41:10.426 --> 41:12.928
<i>so you know what angles</i>
<i>to be shooting it out from</i>

41:13.012 --> 41:16.182
and it just requires
the same amount of rigorous preparation.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.312
That was fun.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.444
The great thing about this show
is that we've been able to build

41:28.527 --> 41:30.779
a lot of sets or be on location
a lot of the times.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.282
<i>So, everything is very real.</i>

41:34.783 --> 41:40.873
Behind me is AvengerCon,
which is really the first MCU comics...

41:40.956 --> 41:43.918
Actually I can't say "comics convention."
Fan convention.

41:44.001 --> 41:47.963
The first MCU fan convention
that really has ever existed.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.634
<i>It's at the home of Captain America,</i>
<i>Camp Lehigh.</i>

41:51.717 --> 41:56.096
Which by the way, guys, is in New Jersey,
which the writers' room discovered.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.600
So very convenient for us, Jersey heroes.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.560
We're trying to stay professional
but it's really hard

42:01.644 --> 42:03.062
when you have all this fun stuff
around you.

42:03.145 --> 42:04.188
It's so fun.

42:04.271 --> 42:08.275
<i>What we tried to do is pay homage</i>
<i>to the conventions that exist</i>

42:08.359 --> 42:09.777
<i>but put an MCU spin on it.</i>

42:09.860 --> 42:10.903
Real rubble.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.572
Yeah. Really of the Battle of New York.

42:13.739 --> 42:17.701
Iman has never seen the set of AvengerCon
so this is gonna be the first time

42:17.785 --> 42:20.412
that she'll witness it and yeah,

42:20.496 --> 42:23.165
it's gonna be pretty dope
to see her reaction.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.125
-Welcome!
-Hi!

42:25.209 --> 42:26.669
-How you doing?
-Good.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.837
-Hey, hey, hey. Well...
-I'm ready.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.173
I'll lead the way here. Come, come.

42:32.383 --> 42:37.429
Here, you can see a glimpse already
and... ta-da!

42:39.139 --> 42:40.558
It looks so good!

42:55.155 --> 42:58.117
The very first time we came here,
we actually had a meeting.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.703
<i>For the first half an hour,</i>
<i>there was no meeting,</i>

43:00.828 --> 43:03.539
It was just me and him running everywhere.

43:03.622 --> 43:04.915
-Like kids.
-Yeah.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.625
So much detail, so much fun.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.751
This is insane.

43:08.043 --> 43:11.005
I've never seen so much detail
put into a set like this.

43:11.088 --> 43:12.464
We're gonna take so many pictures...

43:12.548 --> 43:16.969
And I've been on a lot of sets
and it's like, just, this is outstanding!

43:17.386 --> 43:20.055
You wanna show every detail
but that's why you're here

43:20.139 --> 43:22.933
so that if it doesn't make it
in the final cut,

43:23.017 --> 43:26.645
still can show you the huge,
huge lollipop we got here.

43:26.812 --> 43:31.150
EL ARBI: It's amazing, if we wanna put
the camera anywhere, we can.

43:33.902 --> 43:36.488
This is the place
where you have an exhibition

43:36.572 --> 43:38.699
of everything that the Hulk smashed.

43:38.991 --> 43:42.036
From the Battle of New York in 2012.

43:42.119 --> 43:46.540
It's $3,500, but it's smashed
by the Hulk himself so...

43:46.624 --> 43:48.292
So it's really worth it, you know.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.794
A violin for $5,000. Hulk did this.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.590
I'm looking for a fist, you know,
the big Hulk fist, so I can start just...

43:54.673 --> 43:55.924
Maybe use it in a scene.

43:57.509 --> 44:00.846
Here you can eat some Asgardian food,
I would assume.

44:00.929 --> 44:04.224
Something like the Bifrost macaroni,
as you can see here.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.977
-FALLAH: Yeah, son.
-(LAUGHING)

44:07.061 --> 44:08.270
I'm feeling like a kid again.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.772
I know! I am a kid!

44:09.938 --> 44:12.941
As you can see, you have
a giant Ant-Man head over there.

44:13.776 --> 44:18.238
You have the water and people can sit
on the hands and take pictures here.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.282
Adil's chilling in the Ant-Man hand.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.828
VELLANI: <i>After Kamala finally</i>
<i>activates her powers,</i>

44:25.537 --> 44:30.292
this giant head is gonna end up
on poor Zoe's face.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.503
Well, not necessarily.
You save her, don't you?

44:32.586 --> 44:35.005
I save her, but I also cause the damage.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.384
-Her first heroic act is making sure...
-My first heroic act.

44:38.467 --> 44:41.762
this giant Ant-Man head
doesn't fall on a classmate.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.808
VELLANI: <i>It's gonna be really epic.</i>
<i>It's gonna roll everywhere</i>

44:45.891 --> 44:48.060
<i>all over the place</i>
<i>and there's gonna be harnesses involved.</i>

44:50.270 --> 44:51.772
<i>People just smash into things...</i>

44:51.855 --> 44:53.941
-LINTZ: <i>Crazy stuff is happening.</i>
<i>-...and everything going everywhere.</i>

44:57.194 --> 44:58.195
LINTZ: <i>Explosions!</i>

44:58.278 --> 45:01.907
I could have won the cosplay contest.
But I did that.

45:02.032 --> 45:03.117
Please don't tell anyone.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.411
Stop, okay? I'd never tell anyone.

45:06.912 --> 45:07.913
Never ever?

45:08.122 --> 45:09.123
Never ever ever.

45:15.629 --> 45:16.630
Plot twist!

45:16.714 --> 45:17.715
VELLANI: Plot twist.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.468
AMANAT: <i>The great thing</i>
<i>about Marvel Studios is that</i>

45:21.552 --> 45:24.179
<i>they're not gonna apologize for the fact</i>
<i>that Marvel Comics costumes</i>

45:24.263 --> 45:27.516
<i>are kinda over the top and wild</i>
<i>and colorful and they kinda lean into it.</i>

45:27.599 --> 45:30.477
When we were doing
the cosplay costume, it was super fun

45:30.602 --> 45:32.646
because Kevin's like,
"Yeah, just make it look messier,

45:32.730 --> 45:33.814
"just make it look crazier."

45:33.897 --> 45:35.899
<i>And so we just pushed it</i>
<i>as much as we could</i>

45:35.983 --> 45:38.736
<i>'cause it's something</i>
<i>that Bruno and Kamala put together</i>

45:38.861 --> 45:40.863
<i>and it's not perfect</i>
<i>and it's a little bright</i>

45:40.946 --> 45:43.282
<i>and a little gaudy.</i>
<i>And even just like her helmet</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:46.827
is so wild and crazy,
but just super nerdy.

45:47.411 --> 45:48.787
BRUNO: Are you sure we can keep that on?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.289
What, it's an homage.

45:50.372 --> 45:55.753
BHASIN: <i>We created a Kamala who was</i>
<i>a sort of perfect storm of an artist</i>

45:55.836 --> 45:58.046
<i>but kind of a nerdy character</i>

45:58.130 --> 46:01.258
but also a superfan but also someone

46:01.341 --> 46:03.969
who was kind of effortless
and cool in her own way.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.138
Is that what superheroes wear these days?

46:08.140 --> 46:12.352
Well, I got my handy-dandy mask
that Bruno made for me

46:12.728 --> 46:18.442
because this protects me and covers
my face enough for no one to recognize me.

46:19.568 --> 46:20.569
Um...

46:20.652 --> 46:22.905
And we're wearing our AvengerCon shirt.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.407
Even though I got in trouble for going,

46:25.491 --> 46:28.118
Kamala still managed to get the shirt.
So that's a win for me.

46:28.452 --> 46:31.580
BHASIN: <i>She really, over the course</i>
<i>of this six-episode arc,</i>

46:31.705 --> 46:35.918
<i>finds herself and becomes</i>
<i>someone to be looked up to,</i>

46:36.001 --> 46:37.211
<i>you know, on her own standing.</i>

46:37.669 --> 46:40.714
<i>And the idea with her costume</i>

46:40.839 --> 46:44.885
was very much that there were elements
borrowed from the Marvel Universe.

46:45.344 --> 46:49.264
Um, this idea that she was a fan
of Captain Marvel

46:49.348 --> 46:51.475
<i>and that she wanted to emulate things</i>

46:51.683 --> 46:53.977
<i>that were beautiful</i>
<i>about the Marvel Universe,</i>

46:54.061 --> 46:59.066
<i>but she also brought this wealth</i>
<i>of her own culture to it.</i>

46:59.399 --> 47:01.443
Today is a historical day
because it's the first time

47:01.527 --> 47:06.031
we're gonna see the fully-finished costume
of Ms. Marvel on screen.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.451
WOMAN: Is that Ms. Marvel? Ms. Marvel?

47:09.535 --> 47:11.078
I can breathe in this.

47:11.286 --> 47:13.372
-MAN: That's what you need.
-That's all I need.

47:13.497 --> 47:15.833
It's the first time we're seeing it
on camera with people.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.584
Normally, it's like in my trailer

47:17.709 --> 47:19.586
and they're like,
"Oh, the lighting sucks."

47:21.129 --> 47:25.592
But this is it and I'm very happy. Yeah.
Now we hide it from the world.

47:25.717 --> 47:29.429
BHASIN: <i>The super suit</i>
<i>was the most challenging</i>

47:29.513 --> 47:31.348
<i>and also the most exciting thing.</i>

47:31.515 --> 47:33.183
<i>Because of the situation with COVID</i>

47:33.267 --> 47:36.103
<i>and because of the situation</i>
<i>that we were working under,</i>

47:36.186 --> 47:39.648
we decided that we were gonna
build the suit ourselves

47:40.065 --> 47:43.360
in-house, in our little,
tiny costume shop in Atlanta.

47:43.569 --> 47:47.155
<i>And it was a first time for all of us,</i>
<i>building a super suit.</i>

47:47.281 --> 47:50.576
<i>Of course, we had the blueprint</i>
<i>of the comic book.</i>

47:50.701 --> 47:54.705
<i>We did refer to that a lot.</i>
<i>But it seems like what we landed on</i>

47:54.788 --> 47:59.251
<i>was a sort of hybrid of what's</i>
<i>in the comic</i>

47:59.501 --> 48:03.338
<i>and also what Kamala brought to it herself</i>

48:03.422 --> 48:06.383
and what I brought to it
and what my crew brought to it.

48:06.466 --> 48:09.052
<i>And it has to perform</i>
<i>many, many different tasks.</i>

48:09.136 --> 48:12.347
<i>You know, it has to be</i>
<i>a Marvel super suit,</i>

48:12.431 --> 48:14.516
<i>a Pakistani super suit.</i>

48:14.850 --> 48:18.854
<i>A comfortable super suit,</i>
<i>a made in-house super suit.</i>

48:18.937 --> 48:25.694
Have Islamic elements, Marvel elements,
color elements from Captain Marvel.

48:25.777 --> 48:29.448
<i>But it was a beautiful challenge</i>
<i>and I think...</i>

48:29.531 --> 48:31.283
I hope that we rose to it.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.495
The super suit. It's insane.
It's very surreal. I was like...

48:35.996 --> 48:39.666
I was literally crying last night because
I didn't know how to prep for this.

48:40.042 --> 48:44.713
So I just didn't. But I don't think
anyone can prep for this.

48:45.047 --> 48:48.342
<i>You know, I dressed up as Ms. Marvel</i>
<i>three years ago for Halloween</i>

48:48.425 --> 48:50.552
<i>and I was like looking at those pictures.</i>

48:51.595 --> 48:54.014
It's insane, the difference.

48:54.431 --> 48:58.393
First of all, I thrifted that whole thing
and got my grandma to help me

48:58.477 --> 49:01.521
sew the lightning bolt on
and it was like a whole moment

49:01.605 --> 49:05.776
and then, now I'm wearing it
in a freaking Marvel Universe

49:06.276 --> 49:12.032
which is... I can't even put it into words
how cool this is.

49:12.616 --> 49:15.619
It's very... My heart is very full.

49:20.123 --> 49:22.125
AMANAT: <i>In a lot of ways, this is really</i>

49:22.209 --> 49:25.921
<i>the essence of the Kamala Khan</i>
<i>origin story from the comics</i>

49:26.004 --> 49:29.508
<i>but it's also very, very different.</i>
<i>It's a true adaptation in every way.</i>

49:29.633 --> 49:32.260
<i>The thing I gravitated towards the most</i>

49:32.344 --> 49:34.012
was this idea of family lineage

49:34.137 --> 49:37.599
<i>and the power that is passed on</i>
<i>from one to the other.</i>

49:37.683 --> 49:40.352
I can't do stars, <i>Nani,</i>
but I can do circles, okay?

49:42.020 --> 49:47.317
VELLANI: <i>Basically, Kamala has the ability</i>
<i>to manifest hard light or Noor.</i>

49:47.401 --> 49:50.821
<i>And she uses it to make platforms</i>
<i>and you know,</i>

49:50.904 --> 49:52.656
<i>she can embiggen her fists.</i>

49:52.864 --> 49:56.576
So we got that going for us.
It's very different from the comics.

49:57.452 --> 49:59.705
<i>In the comics,</i>
<i>Kamala could like shapeshift</i>

49:59.788 --> 50:03.709
<i>and just grow in size</i>
<i>and also get really small.</i>

50:04.710 --> 50:06.128
I think there was a conscious effort

50:06.211 --> 50:11.800
to not have her feel like Mr. Fantastic
or Elastigirl.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.803
<i>There were some early concepts</i>
<i>before I got on that had this idea</i>

50:14.886 --> 50:18.849
<i>that she could manifest armor</i>
<i>or parts of her body</i>

50:18.932 --> 50:20.142
<i>in this protective element.</i>

50:20.225 --> 50:22.227
<i>And so I saw this as an opportunity.</i>
<i>I mean, how often</i>

50:22.310 --> 50:25.564
do you get to come into the MCU
and make up a power from scratch,

50:25.731 --> 50:28.150
which is to me, the most exciting,

50:28.233 --> 50:29.860
the most fun thing you could do.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.697
<i>So, you know, I love this idea</i>
<i>that she was able to manipulate</i>

50:33.780 --> 50:35.449
<i>this energy from another source.</i>

50:35.615 --> 50:36.908
<i>You know, Sana described it as,</i>

50:36.992 --> 50:40.120
<i>imagine it if you were like to look</i>
<i>at a lens flare and you trap that,</i>

50:40.412 --> 50:43.582
<i>you harden a lens flare that you see</i>
<i>with your eye or through optics.</i>

50:43.915 --> 50:45.876
<i>That was an interesting way</i>
<i>of describing it.</i>

50:46.001 --> 50:49.171
<i>So I then started building ways</i>

50:49.254 --> 50:51.089
of making what she's building,

50:51.590 --> 50:54.468
<i>this energy that she can create</i>
<i>or channel through herself</i>

50:54.551 --> 50:57.888
<i>manifest in our dimension</i>
<i>as these objects.</i>

50:58.305 --> 50:59.556
Wow, that's...

51:00.599 --> 51:01.600
amazing.

51:02.642 --> 51:03.810
How does it feel?

51:05.979 --> 51:07.314
Like an idea come to life.

51:07.647 --> 51:11.443
RAHHALI: <i>Platforms allowed her to get</i>
<i>to places that you wouldn't be able to.</i>

51:11.526 --> 51:13.945
<i>Like she can't fly but she can certainly</i>
<i>run off a building</i>

51:14.029 --> 51:16.490
<i>and continue running across it</i>
<i>to another building</i>

51:16.573 --> 51:18.366
<i>or get down to the street level.</i>

51:18.533 --> 51:22.079
<i>She can create walls or shields</i>

51:22.162 --> 51:25.373
and eventually she's able to do things
like her embiggened fists,

51:25.457 --> 51:28.668
which are complete... I wanted to pay
an homage to the comics there.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.008
Episode six is the last act,

51:35.092 --> 51:38.428
so it's basically
the third act of a movie.

51:38.512 --> 51:41.014
<i>It's gonna have action</i>
<i>and passion and drama</i>

51:41.098 --> 51:42.808
<i>and it's gonna go, you know, to a buildup,</i>

51:42.891 --> 51:44.643
<i>it's gonna go crescendo,</i>
<i>crescendo, crescendo,</i>

51:44.726 --> 51:46.603
you'll be on the edge of your seat
and then...

51:46.686 --> 51:47.687
BOTH: Boom!

51:49.981 --> 51:53.110
So, today we're gonna do
like a super cool explosion stunt

51:53.360 --> 51:57.322
with our actors in real life,
where we're gonna duck behind the corner

51:57.447 --> 52:00.200
and then there's gonna be a explosion.

52:00.450 --> 52:03.286
So hopefully, it all pans out
'cause can only do it once.

52:03.411 --> 52:05.080
-(CHUCKLES)
-Yeah!

52:07.415 --> 52:08.458
MAN: Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

52:08.542 --> 52:10.335
Nice, nice, nice!

52:11.795 --> 52:12.838
Any questions?

52:14.131 --> 52:15.298
Why is hero spelled wrong?

52:15.382 --> 52:17.342
LINTZ: <i>Aamir sneaks in on the plan</i>

52:17.926 --> 52:19.427
and scares everybody to death.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.931
And now, Aamir's a part
of the great Kamala Khan plan.

52:23.014 --> 52:26.226
That's what I do, you know.
I just kinda swoop in

52:26.393 --> 52:29.813
and take control.
Or at least, I think I'm taking control.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.315
-But really I have nothing under control.
-WOMAN: Stop lying.

52:32.399 --> 52:33.567
(LAUGHS)

52:33.650 --> 52:34.860
That's exactly what happens to Aamir.

52:34.943 --> 52:36.695
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, it's okay
'cause it's just in his head.

52:36.778 --> 52:39.364
You know, as long as he's
happy and confident in himself,

52:39.447 --> 52:40.907
you know... We've got that.

52:40.991 --> 52:42.868
Yeah. I'm always happy and confident
in myself, you know.

52:42.951 --> 52:46.746
Yeah. So this plan is getting unfolded,
as you see, there's a chalkboard.

52:47.205 --> 52:49.958
We're supposed to stop Damage Control
with softballs?

52:50.083 --> 52:53.211
No. We are going to stall Damage Control
with softballs.

52:53.753 --> 52:57.340
The real plan is (WHISPERS) Zoe.

52:57.549 --> 53:03.013
LINTZ: <i>We got all sorts of gadgets</i>
<i>and traps and Zuzu system.</i>

53:03.138 --> 53:04.723
<i>The Zuzu system's here.</i>

53:04.806 --> 53:07.142
And also, I got my brain.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.729
Okay. Actually, I think it's more
Bruno's brain but it's okay.

53:11.062 --> 53:12.105
You got my beard.

53:12.981 --> 53:14.024
Let's move on!

53:17.444 --> 53:18.653
You're doing your own stunt.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.113
VELLANI: I know. I'm so excited.

53:21.281 --> 53:24.117
It was built up in our heads
for a long time

53:24.201 --> 53:27.537
so I think, all of us were like, "God,
I hope it meets our expectations,"

53:27.954 --> 53:30.165
<i>and it not only met them,</i>
<i>but surpassed them.</i>

53:30.248 --> 53:32.792
MARSDEN: <i>I certainly could not grasp</i>

53:32.876 --> 53:34.878
the scale of a project like this.

53:34.961 --> 53:38.340
<i>It is truly astounding</i>
<i>what they are able to do.</i>

53:38.423 --> 53:40.675
And obviously
seeing it in person is even cooler.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.801
DIRECTOR: Action!

53:42.594 --> 53:47.349
Just like cuts. So, we go from
"it's working" to smack on the ground.

53:47.432 --> 53:48.433
It's working.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.565
And we're following the storyboards.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.446
This is the finale of episode six.

54:02.239 --> 54:05.075
<i>So there's a lot that happens</i>
<i>between Kamran and Kamala.</i>

54:06.701 --> 54:09.871
She slowly starts to find her way
a bit more

54:09.955 --> 54:13.083
and she slowly starts
to control those powers.

54:15.043 --> 54:18.463
SHAH: <i>With Kamran, it's overwhelming</i>
<i>and it's spilling out of him</i>

54:18.546 --> 54:23.551
<i>and it's kind of like a raging river</i>
<i>to the point where,</i>

54:23.718 --> 54:25.428
you know, he goes nuclear and he pulses

54:25.512 --> 54:28.139
and he's hurting people
he doesn't even want to hurt.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.893
<i>We're building up the scene where</i>

54:31.977 --> 54:35.563
the SWAT team kinda storm in
and they take a shot at Kamran

54:35.814 --> 54:39.025
and that's why this wall over here
that you see is blown up.

54:40.277 --> 54:43.321
And then, this is just the scene
we've just shot is moments after that

54:43.405 --> 54:46.449
when Kamala's basically
just looking at Kamran

54:46.533 --> 54:48.785
and begging him not to do
what he's about to do.

54:48.910 --> 54:53.665
<i>And that's when he kind of just says,</i>
<i>"Screw this," and steps back out</i>

54:53.748 --> 54:58.420
<i>into the line of fire and really uses</i>
<i>his powers in full force</i>

54:58.503 --> 55:01.840
and all the lockers come flying off
and it was awesome.

55:01.923 --> 55:05.302
The stunt team just did an incredible job
of somehow not getting crushed.

55:06.469 --> 55:08.388
SHAH: I lost my balance.
(LAUGHS)

55:08.471 --> 55:10.932
Oh, no! They're gonna have to die again.

55:13.768 --> 55:17.314
WOMAN: Fire! One, two, three! Freeze!

55:17.814 --> 55:20.650
We are here now,
in the exterior of the high school,

55:21.151 --> 55:24.696
where you have
the epic finale ending of episode six.

55:24.988 --> 55:29.284
<i>We have the characters of Kamran</i>
<i>and Kamala and all the kids,</i>

55:29.367 --> 55:31.453
they are outside and it's like,
basically a stand-off.

55:31.536 --> 55:32.620
Fire!

55:36.041 --> 55:38.877
FALLAH: <i>Lot of superpower,</i>
<i>lot of coolnessness.</i>

55:38.960 --> 55:42.881
I think it's also the real moment
Kamala Khan becomes Ms. Marvel.

55:42.964 --> 55:45.633
<i>She becomes embiggened</i>
<i>and we see her in the full form</i>

55:45.717 --> 55:48.887
<i>and we see the real deal,</i>
<i>what she really is.</i>

55:49.304 --> 55:51.598
AMANAT: <i>She effectively,</i>
<i>you know, armors up.</i>

55:53.058 --> 55:54.684
All this hard light
that you've been seeing

55:54.768 --> 55:56.853
pockets of throughout the entire show,

55:56.936 --> 56:00.023
encases her entire body
and she becomes even bigger.

56:00.106 --> 56:01.816
<i>Bigger than she can ever imagine.</i>

56:01.941 --> 56:03.109
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

56:04.361 --> 56:07.614
This was a big stunt,
some practical effects,

56:07.697 --> 56:12.118
and story-wise, it is when Kamala,
first time is gonna be embiggened.

56:12.577 --> 56:15.997
<i>She jumps and crashes</i>
<i>to take out that sonar gun</i>

56:16.122 --> 56:19.959
and her impact causes the cars
to fly away.

56:20.043 --> 56:22.170
It's a memorable hero moment.

56:25.507 --> 56:26.508
ALL: Whoa!

56:26.591 --> 56:27.634
Yeah!

56:31.930 --> 56:34.766
AMANAT: <i>This world has a way</i>
<i>of making people feel small</i>

56:35.100 --> 56:39.020
and so it's on Kamala
to take up more space

56:39.104 --> 56:41.731
<i>and to really bring out more</i>
<i>and more of herself</i>

56:41.815 --> 56:45.485
<i>and that's really why we decided to have</i>
<i>this moment at the end of six.</i>

56:45.568 --> 56:48.530
VELLANI: <i>You know, it's this giant</i>
<i>culminating thing where we get to see</i>

56:48.696 --> 56:50.740
<i>all of our Jersey City characters.</i>

56:50.907 --> 56:54.619
<i>Everyone from the gyro stand guy</i>
<i>to people at school.</i>

56:54.702 --> 56:58.289
Everybody comes together
and it's a really empowering moment.

56:59.958 --> 57:01.835
(SCREAMING)

57:04.921 --> 57:06.047
(GRUNTING)

57:06.131 --> 57:07.173
Kamran.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.300
(KAMRAN GROANS)

57:11.803 --> 57:13.388
VELLANI: <i>Kamala and Kamran get trapped</i>

57:13.471 --> 57:17.725
in this giant dome bubble thing
of light power

57:18.017 --> 57:20.395
and they have
this whole conversation about how,

57:20.603 --> 57:23.064
you know, you're allowed
to be more than one thing

57:23.148 --> 57:26.609
because there's...
Every minority deals with this thing.

57:26.693 --> 57:30.029
Where like, for example,
if I go to Pakistan, I'm too Canadian,

57:30.113 --> 57:32.073
if I go to Canada, I'm too Pakistani.

57:32.282 --> 57:36.077
But you're allowed to have
this in-between and be both.

57:36.161 --> 57:38.037
<i>Kamran's part</i> Djinn <i>and part human.</i>

57:38.121 --> 57:39.998
<i>Kamala's part</i> Djinn <i>and part human.</i>

57:40.248 --> 57:44.502
<i>And they're together just finding</i>
<i>this happy in-between.</i>

57:45.086 --> 57:47.672
What am I supposed to do now?
How can I be normal?

57:49.090 --> 57:50.508
There is no normal.

57:52.218 --> 57:55.388
There's just us and what we do
with what we've been given.

57:55.972 --> 57:57.182
I'll buy you time.

58:01.269 --> 58:04.647
AMANAT: <i>I just feel very, very lucky</i>
<i>that I get to be here,</i>

58:04.772 --> 58:06.983
<i>that people fell in love with Kamala,</i>

58:07.066 --> 58:09.068
that they understand
what she stands for.

58:09.152 --> 58:12.864
<i>I just hope that people know that we have</i>
<i>put our blood, sweat, and tears</i>

58:12.947 --> 58:15.450
in one of the most chaotic times
in human history

58:15.909 --> 58:18.870
<i>to tell a story that is really meaningful</i>
<i>to a lot of people</i>

58:18.953 --> 58:20.580
<i>and that's really important.</i>

58:22.624 --> 58:23.666
And we meant it.

58:32.133 --> 58:35.470
I've been thinking a lot
about the beginning of the comic

58:35.845 --> 58:39.349
<i>and issue number one</i>
<i>and the pitch of this story</i>

58:39.474 --> 58:42.769
and then to be here in Thailand
and looking all around me

58:42.852 --> 58:45.855
<i>and all of the people</i>
<i>who have brought this story to life</i>

58:45.939 --> 58:49.108
<i>who I didn't know a year ago,</i>
<i>five years ago,</i>

58:49.192 --> 58:51.986
<i>and certainly not seven years ago</i>
<i>when we put this story together</i>

58:52.070 --> 58:54.531
and put this character together.
It's really momentous.

58:54.822 --> 58:56.824
We all just tried to get in the last shot.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.536
BERGER: <i>They cut us out.</i>
MENON: <i>We weren't very successful.</i>

58:59.702 --> 59:02.622
Everyone's so committed
to being a part of this

59:02.705 --> 59:06.209
and everyone realizes
how special of a project that this is

59:06.543 --> 59:08.169
<i>and honors that every day.</i>

59:08.586 --> 59:10.672
OBAID-CHINOY: <i>Years from now,</i>
<i>I'll look back at this</i>

59:10.755 --> 59:13.424
and know that we did something
that mattered,

59:13.591 --> 59:17.220
<i>that was important, and it was</i>
<i>the right time to tell this story.</i>

59:17.554 --> 59:20.932
<i>And that in doing so, we will, hopefully,</i>

59:21.099 --> 59:24.644
enable many, many young women
around the world

59:24.727 --> 59:27.438
<i>to become superheroes</i>
<i>in their own communities.</i>

59:28.439 --> 59:31.401
BERGER: <i>We're entering</i>
<i>a new point of the MCU</i>

59:31.484 --> 59:35.321
and I think audiences are really ready
to see different kinds of superheroes.

59:35.738 --> 59:39.117
<i>We're at a point where there are</i>
<i>such huge fans of the movies.</i>

59:39.534 --> 59:42.120
<i>What could be more fun than seeing a girl</i>

59:42.203 --> 59:45.957
<i>who's a huge fan of the same exact people</i>
<i>as we are join their ranks?</i>

59:47.792 --> 59:49.544
It's very interesting to see the parallel

59:49.627 --> 59:53.172
between the character of Kamala Khan
and Iman Vellani herself

59:53.256 --> 59:57.427
because Kamala Khan is this girl who never
would expect that she would be part of,

59:57.510 --> 59:59.721
<i>the superheroes, of the Avengers.</i>

59:59.804 --> 1:00:02.473
<i>She's a big fan of Captain Marvel</i>
<i>and the other Avengers.</i>

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:05.977
<i>But you know, she's just like</i>
<i>a normal Brown girl of Jersey</i>

1:00:06.060 --> 1:00:07.729
<i>who never believes</i>
<i>she's gonna be part of that.</i>

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:10.898
<i>In the same way,</i>
<i>Iman's story is that story.</i>

1:00:10.982 --> 1:00:16.070
<i>It is a girl that grew up like all of us</i>
<i>with the Marvel movies, Marvel Universe.</i>

1:00:16.988 --> 1:00:19.032
I'm in tears. This is so good!

1:00:19.115 --> 1:00:21.326
<i>She never believed to be</i>
<i>be part of that universe.</i>

1:00:21.409 --> 1:00:23.745
She never believed
she would be part of all these actors

1:00:23.828 --> 1:00:25.413
and being herself a superhero.

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:30.293
So that is like a kind of
meta storytelling that we're doing.

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:34.172
<i>We're telling the story of Kamala Khan,</i>
<i>and also telling the story of Iman</i>

1:00:34.255 --> 1:00:37.800
<i>and I think you'll all feel that through</i>
<i>the way that she portrays that character.</i>

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:41.346
Feels like it's destined.
It was her destiny. Unbelievable.

1:00:41.512 --> 1:00:43.931
You sure are,

1:00:44.015 --> 1:00:45.850
always have been
our own little...

1:00:48.269 --> 1:00:49.312
Ms. Marvel.

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:56.527
I'm a superhero now. So, that's normal.

1:00:58.279 --> 1:01:00.990
I'll go grab coffee
with Spider-Man tomorrow.

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:04.369
Maybe, you know,
catch a movie with Iron Man.

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:06.579
It can happen.

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:14.754
WOMAN: How do you feel? You okay?

1:01:14.962 --> 1:01:15.963
VELLANI: Just like a chair!

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:17.131
-Yeah.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

1:01:20.343 --> 1:01:23.179
We completely blanked on our dance moves.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:28.434
This is aunties' chance
to hang with the cool kids.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:33.981
(LAUGHS)

1:01:39.862 --> 1:01:43.116
I haven't caused total destruction yet.
So that's good.

1:01:43.241 --> 1:01:45.034
-I have but on accident.
-Yeah.

1:01:45.868 --> 1:01:48.621
We have actually gone through this
like 20-plus times

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:50.456
and it's just more
and more fun every time.

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:54.168
<i>Like, I could watch this forever.</i>
<i>It's really fun.</i>

1:01:57.088 --> 1:01:58.715
Done, man. I'm going pro.
