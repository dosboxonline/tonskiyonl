01:00.511 --> 01:02.220
How we doing, Richard?

01:02.304 --> 01:03.638
We should pass
over the English coast

01:03.722 --> 01:05.223
15 minutes
ahead of time, sir.

01:05.474 --> 01:08.560
Well, with this
load on our back,
that's good going.

01:08.644 --> 01:10.687
Just trust the RAF, sir.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.392
What the hell is that?

01:49.518 --> 01:50.977
The shuttle ignition.

02:06.035 --> 02:07.785
Disappeared?

02:07.911 --> 02:09.704
And what happened
to the Moonraker?

02:12.541 --> 02:14.208
Good God.

02:16.128 --> 02:19.088
Yes, yes, of course, Minister.
Right away.

02:25.804 --> 02:29.599
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?

02:29.683 --> 02:30.975
He's on his last leg, sir.

02:38.734 --> 02:42.403
Any higher, Mr. Bond,
my ears will pop.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.619
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.746
You're so right, Mr. Bond.

03:00.341 --> 03:01.925
This is where we
leave you, Mr. Bond.

03:02.009 --> 03:04.260
A little premature, isn't it?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.934
Enjoy your flight.

06:14.702 --> 06:19.414
<i>Where are you?</i>

06:19.498 --> 06:23.543
<i>Why do you hide?</i>

06:24.628 --> 06:28.047
<i>Where is that moonlight trail</i>

06:28.132 --> 06:32.051
<i>That leads to your side?</i>

06:32.219 --> 06:37.807
<i>Just like the Moonraker goes</i>

06:38.142 --> 06:43.229
<i>In search of his dream of gold</i>

06:43.898 --> 06:48.151
<i>I search for love</i>

06:48.360 --> 06:53.114
<i>For someone to have and hold</i>

06:53.490 --> 06:56.993
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

06:57.828 --> 07:03.166
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

07:03.500 --> 07:06.836
<i>Felt your touch</i>

07:07.880 --> 07:12.842
<i>And it always seems</i>

07:13.010 --> 07:24.395
<i>You love me</i>

07:34.448 --> 07:38.409
<i>Where are you?</i>

07:39.536 --> 07:43.623
<i>When will we meet?</i>

07:44.625 --> 07:47.794
<i>Take my unfinished life</i>

07:47.878 --> 07:51.756
<i>And make it complete</i>

07:51.882 --> 07:57.514
<i>Just like the Moonraker knows</i>

07:57.723 --> 08:02.602
<i>His dream will
come true someday</i>

08:03.396 --> 08:07.524
<i>I know that you</i>

08:07.608 --> 08:12.362
<i>Are only a kiss away</i>

08:12.446 --> 08:16.992
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

08:17.076 --> 08:22.122
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

08:22.748 --> 08:26.334
<i>Felt your touch</i>

08:27.128 --> 08:32.006
<i>And it always seems</i>

08:32.091 --> 08:44.269
<i>You love me</i>

08:59.160 --> 09:00.452
Good morning, Moneypenny.

09:00.578 --> 09:01.870
James.

09:01.954 --> 09:03.371
But why are you so late?

09:03.456 --> 09:05.665
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.

09:06.834 --> 09:07.876
Who's in there?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.586
Q and the Minister
of Defense.

09:10.212 --> 09:11.880
You don't believe me,
do you?

09:11.964 --> 09:13.423
And you should
go right in.

09:13.507 --> 09:15.133
Yes, Moneypenny.

09:18.637 --> 09:21.014
007. At last.

09:21.098 --> 09:22.432
Good morning, sir.

09:22.516 --> 09:25.101
I think you know
Frederick Gray,
Minister of Defense.

09:25.186 --> 09:26.853
Commander.
Minister. Q.

09:26.937 --> 09:28.480
007.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.068
Moonraker?

09:33.152 --> 09:35.070
What do you know
about Moonraker?

09:35.196 --> 09:37.072
What I read
in the newspaper, sir.

09:37.156 --> 09:39.157
Then you'll know
that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,

09:39.241 --> 09:40.241
was being flown over here

09:40.326 --> 09:42.744
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.

09:42.828 --> 09:44.996
Yes, which crashed
somewhere in the Yukon,

09:45.081 --> 09:47.290
aircraft and shuttle
totally destroyed,
correct?

09:47.374 --> 09:48.583
That's the official version.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.377
The truth is rather
more disturbing, 007.

09:51.462 --> 09:53.088
Look at this.

09:59.512 --> 10:01.054
Now, that's
the scene of the crash.

10:01.138 --> 10:03.556
Wreckage strewn
over a large area.

10:03.808 --> 10:05.558
That's all that's
left of the fuselage.

10:05.643 --> 10:07.560
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,

10:07.645 --> 10:10.146
but there's no sign
of Moonraker, not a trace.

10:10.231 --> 10:12.732
Are you suggesting
the shuttle was
hijacked in midair?

10:12.817 --> 10:15.026
That's for you
to find out, 007.

10:15.111 --> 10:17.570
The shuttles are
built in California
by Drax Industries.

10:17.655 --> 10:22.534
Yes. We were responsible
for the safety of that
shuttle, Commander.

10:22.618 --> 10:25.787
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.

10:25.871 --> 10:27.705
I can imagine.

10:27.873 --> 10:30.291
Then, California must
be the place to start.
I agree.

10:30.376 --> 10:32.794
Don't make any mistakes, 007.

10:32.878 --> 10:34.546
The situation is critical.

10:34.713 --> 10:36.381
We've got to
find that shuttle.

10:36.465 --> 10:37.882
Yes, sir.

10:38.634 --> 10:40.135
If that's all,
gentlemen...

10:40.219 --> 10:42.011
Ah, just a minute, 007.

10:42.471 --> 10:44.139
I've got something
for you.

10:46.559 --> 10:49.853
Roll up your
right sleeve, will you?

10:49.937 --> 10:52.856
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.

10:52.940 --> 10:54.899
Strap it on your wrist.

10:59.155 --> 11:02.532
It's activated
by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.950
Like this?

11:06.328 --> 11:08.830
Oh, thank you, 007.

11:08.914 --> 11:11.332
Be careful, will you?
Yes, Q.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.544
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,

11:14.628 --> 11:18.840
five red-tipped,
cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.

11:18.924 --> 11:20.258
Very novel, Q.

11:20.342 --> 11:22.677
You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.

11:22.761 --> 11:23.761
Good morning, gentlemen.

11:36.817 --> 11:39.110
Welcome to California,
Mr. Bond.

11:39.486 --> 11:41.321
I like it already.

11:51.957 --> 11:54.292
My name is Corinne Dufour.

11:54.376 --> 11:57.045
Oh, and you're going to be
showing me around, are you,
Corinne?

11:57.129 --> 12:01.382
No. I'm just a humble pilot
in the service of
the Drax Corporation.

12:11.727 --> 12:13.686
This is the Drax estate now.

12:13.771 --> 12:16.397
Everything you see
belongs to Mr. Drax.

12:17.775 --> 12:19.067
Owns a lot, doesn't he?

12:19.151 --> 12:21.027
What he doesn't own,
he doesn't want.

12:26.158 --> 12:28.826
We're approaching
the main complex now.

12:30.996 --> 12:32.747
That's where
the Moonraker shuttle
is made?

12:32.831 --> 12:35.750
That's right,
workshops, hangars,

12:35.834 --> 12:39.963
design and
experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.

12:40.047 --> 12:41.506
Very impressive.

12:51.934 --> 12:55.855
I'd heard that
Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.

12:55.982 --> 12:57.691
Now, I can believe it.

12:59.026 --> 13:00.026
Good Lord.

13:08.244 --> 13:09.828
The Drax residence.

13:09.912 --> 13:12.038
Every stone
brought from France.

13:13.874 --> 13:15.125
Cute, isn't it?

13:15.209 --> 13:16.584
Magnificent.

13:16.877 --> 13:18.628
Why didn't he buy
the Eiffel Tower as well?

13:18.713 --> 13:22.340
He did, but the French
government refused him
an export permit.

13:39.775 --> 13:40.900
Look there.

13:40.985 --> 13:42.861
Those are
the astronaut trainees.

13:42.945 --> 13:44.904
Mr. Drax is
financing the entire

13:44.989 --> 13:46.906
training program
out of his own pocket.

13:48.576 --> 13:51.703
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.

14:11.223 --> 14:15.268
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond
in the drawing room,
Miss Dufour.

14:15.353 --> 14:16.519
Thank you, Cavendish.

14:16.604 --> 14:18.229
This way, please, sir.

14:56.977 --> 14:59.312
Mr. Bond, sir.

15:02.733 --> 15:03.900
Mr. Bond.

15:03.984 --> 15:05.110
Mr. Drax.

15:05.861 --> 15:09.489
Allow me to present,
before they leave us,
Countess Lubinski,

15:09.573 --> 15:12.534
Lady Victoria Devon,
Mr. Bond.

15:13.035 --> 15:15.078
How do you do?

15:17.164 --> 15:21.376
Well, my dear fellow,
your reputation
precedes you, of course.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.253
I'm honored that
your government
should send you

15:23.337 --> 15:25.004
on so delicate a mission.

15:25.923 --> 15:27.340
Delicate, Mr. Drax?

15:27.425 --> 15:31.386
Well, to apologize
in person for the loss
of my space shuttle.

15:32.847 --> 15:36.307
How would Oscar Wilde
have put it?

15:36.392 --> 15:40.603
"To lose one aircraft
may be regarded
as a misfortune,

15:41.772 --> 15:44.691
"to lose two seems
like carelessness. "

15:48.154 --> 15:52.198
Well, an apology will be made
to the American government,
Mr. Drax,

15:52.283 --> 15:54.868
when we've discovered
why there was no trace
of the Moonraker

15:54.952 --> 15:56.411
in that wreckage.

15:56.495 --> 15:59.706
And your loyalty
commands respect, Mr. Bond.

16:01.959 --> 16:04.711
You have arrived
at a propitious moment,

16:04.795 --> 16:08.131
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution

16:08.215 --> 16:11.050
to Western civilization.

16:11.135 --> 16:12.886
Afternoon tea.

16:13.721 --> 16:16.055
May I press you to
a cucumber sandwich?

16:16.223 --> 16:18.516
Thank you, no,
nothing at all.

16:18.601 --> 16:21.436
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.147
No. I own a number
of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

16:24.231 --> 16:25.982
producing components.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.401
The conquest of space
represents an investment

16:28.486 --> 16:31.654
in the future of the entire
human race, Mr. Bond.

16:32.448 --> 16:34.032
It is, therefore,
logical to seek out

16:34.116 --> 16:36.826
the best that each
nation has to offer.

16:38.037 --> 16:40.872
Are you referring
to people or skills?

16:41.790 --> 16:44.626
Both, Mr. Bond.

16:53.427 --> 16:55.136
Am I too soon?

16:55.221 --> 16:57.055
Not at all.

16:57.264 --> 17:00.600
I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.

17:00.684 --> 17:01.893
Miss Dufour will escort you

17:01.977 --> 17:04.354
to Dr. Goodhead
who will show you around.

17:04.438 --> 17:06.564
Ask anything you like.

17:06.648 --> 17:08.316
Thank you for being
so cooperative.

17:08.442 --> 17:10.151
A pleasure.

17:20.412 --> 17:23.289
Look after Mr. Bond.

17:23.415 --> 17:26.291
See that some harm
comes to him.

17:30.047 --> 17:32.590
You'll find Dr. Goodhead
first on the right.

17:32.675 --> 17:34.676
Oh. Thank you for the ride.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.886
Call on me
if you need anything.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.330
Good afternoon.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.540
Can I help you?

18:03.624 --> 18:05.959
Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.711
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.504
You just found her.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.424
A woman.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.303
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.346
James, to my friends.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.849
Holly Goodhead.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.893
Are you training
to be an astronaut?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.146
I'm fully trained.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.274
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.945
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd
better get started.

18:34.030 --> 18:38.241
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle,
do you?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.667
This is it,
the Moonraker.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.170
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

18:50.254 --> 18:52.464
Orbiting the Earth
and reentering
the atmosphere to land

18:52.548 --> 18:54.924
like any conventional
aircraft.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.142
This is
the centrifuge training.

19:04.226 --> 19:08.855
It simulates
the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.905
The speed is controlled by
the instructor from up there.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.074
Why not try it?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.577
Why not?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.585
Strap yourself in firmly.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.630
Yes, Doctor.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.800
Now your arms.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.344
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.720
I see.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.897
How fast does it go?

19:52.108 --> 19:55.193
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.029
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.116
Most people
pass out at seven.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.702
You make a great saleswoman.

20:03.786 --> 20:07.831
You don't have to worry.
This is what we call
a "Chicken Switch. "

20:07.915 --> 20:09.999
You just keep your
finger on that button,

20:10.084 --> 20:12.544
the moment the pressure
gets too much for you,
release the button

20:12.628 --> 20:14.087
and the power's cut off.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.213
Just like that?

20:16.424 --> 20:17.882
Come on, Mr. Bond.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.093
A 70-year-old
can take 3 Gs.

20:20.594 --> 20:24.597
Well, the trouble is
there is never a 70-year-old
around when you need one.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.230
You want me?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.982
Mr. Drax says
to telephone him.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.067
All right,
I'll call him
from my office.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.987
You go ahead.
I'll be right back.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.532
The instructor will
supervise the session.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.534
Enjoy yourself.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.545
Yes. We're taking
good care of him.

23:25.156 --> 23:28.867
I don't know what
could've happened.

23:28.951 --> 23:32.037
Something must've
gone wrong with
the controls.

23:46.761 --> 23:48.720
Let me help you.

24:20.127 --> 24:24.381
My mother gave me
a list of things
not to do on a first date.

24:24.465 --> 24:26.216
Maybe you won't need it.

24:26.384 --> 24:28.051
That's not what I came for.

24:28.135 --> 24:31.221
No. What do you want then?

24:33.808 --> 24:38.520
Would your feelings
be shattered if I were
to say information?

24:38.604 --> 24:40.647
Why should I
tell you anything?

24:40.773 --> 24:42.857
Why, indeed?

24:48.197 --> 24:50.782
You presume
a great deal, Mr. Bond.

25:07.258 --> 25:10.343
What goes on here
besides the manufacture
of Moonraker?

25:10.428 --> 25:13.054
And the astronaut
training program?

25:13.139 --> 25:14.931
There are
other laboratories,

25:15.016 --> 25:17.475
but not much is
happening now.

25:17.768 --> 25:19.602
No?

25:19.687 --> 25:22.188
They were working
on something very secret,

25:22.314 --> 25:24.816
but everything's been moved.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.818
Where to?

25:29.155 --> 25:31.656
I don't know.

25:36.871 --> 25:40.749
What about that
list of your mother's?

25:40.833 --> 25:43.460
I never learned to read.

26:41.519 --> 26:44.104
What are you doing?

26:44.188 --> 26:47.732
You whetted my appetite
for information.

26:47.817 --> 26:51.236
Is there a safe
in here? Thank you.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.448
James, no.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.368
That's amazing.

27:42.121 --> 27:43.705
There you are, you see?

27:43.789 --> 27:45.582
You have a heart of gold.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.584
Eighteen karat.

28:24.582 --> 28:25.540
You must go.

28:25.625 --> 28:28.668
Well, you go first.
I'll turn off the lights.

28:33.758 --> 28:35.675
Thank you.

28:43.309 --> 28:44.351
Take care of yourself.

28:44.435 --> 28:45.894
And you.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.910
Ah, my dear Bond.

30:25.995 --> 30:31.041
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.460
Ladies.
I'll see you at lunch.

30:36.422 --> 30:39.174
A pity you leave us.
Such good sport.

30:40.426 --> 30:41.760
Unless you're a pheasant.

30:41.844 --> 30:46.348
Really,
Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.

30:46.432 --> 30:48.808
I only stopped to thank you
for your hospitality.

30:48.893 --> 30:52.395
Fraser will get you
to the airport
in plenty of time.

30:54.273 --> 30:56.191
Come now.

31:14.794 --> 31:16.544
I doubt if I'm
in your class.

31:16.629 --> 31:18.463
Oh, you're too modest,
Mr. Bond.

31:26.806 --> 31:28.640
Over there.

31:36.273 --> 31:38.191
You missed, Mr. Bond.

31:40.694 --> 31:41.986
Did I?

31:43.948 --> 31:47.659
As you said,
such good sport.

32:11.016 --> 32:13.935
You called for me,
Mr. Drax.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.146
You were with Bond
last night in my study.

32:16.230 --> 32:17.230
No, I...

32:17.314 --> 32:19.441
You showed him the safe.
I didn't.

32:19.525 --> 32:21.025
I'm terminating
your employment.

32:21.110 --> 32:22.944
You will leave immediately.

33:54.622 --> 33:55.997
Franco, I'll call you
to tell you where to meet me.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.730
Could I interest
you in something?

34:20.815 --> 34:23.608
Why, I'm tempted to
say yes immediately.

34:23.693 --> 34:26.235
But I think maybe
I'd better have
a look around.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.822
Please. Go anywhere
you wish.

35:12.074 --> 35:15.368
<i>And in 1955,
the Venini Museum
and Glass Works</i>

35:15.453 --> 35:17.287
<i>was taken over by
Drax Industries.</i>

35:18.080 --> 35:19.414
And here,
ladies and gentlemen,

35:19.540 --> 35:20.915
we have some of
the rarest examples

35:21.000 --> 35:22.500
of the glassblower's art.

35:22.585 --> 35:26.212
As you know,
everything was done
absolutely by hand.

35:26.881 --> 35:29.132
Here is a vase done
by Lorenzo Graziati,

35:29.216 --> 35:31.885
sometime between
1850 and 1860.

35:32.053 --> 35:34.721
If you'd like to
follow me over here.

35:37.141 --> 35:41.144
This exquisite
bowl was fashioned
about 1520,

35:41.228 --> 35:43.438
over 450 years ago.

35:43.522 --> 35:44.773
If it ever came
on the market,

35:44.899 --> 35:46.191
it would certainly
fetch a price

35:46.275 --> 35:49.486
in excess of one million
American dollars.

35:49.862 --> 35:51.821
But if any of you
are thinking of taking it...

35:54.533 --> 35:57.327
Now, we have here
a very early 17th century dish

35:57.411 --> 35:59.079
with an aquamarine medallion.

35:59.163 --> 36:02.999
Over here, we have
something very,
very interesting.

36:03.668 --> 36:05.460
This glass-handled sword,

36:05.544 --> 36:09.047
the only one of its kind
in the world,

36:09.131 --> 36:12.842
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century

36:12.927 --> 36:14.135
and is the work of Bruno...

36:47.461 --> 36:49.421
14th century.

36:53.300 --> 36:55.343
Dr. Goodhead.

36:55.428 --> 36:58.930
I can only hope
your presence here
is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.

36:59.014 --> 37:00.849
I dislike being spied on.

37:00.933 --> 37:02.934
Well, don't we all?

37:03.769 --> 37:05.729
You're staying
at the Danieli,
aren't you?

37:05.813 --> 37:07.564
Yes. How did you know?

37:07.648 --> 37:09.733
Well, I like to
keep abreast of things.

37:11.110 --> 37:14.404
May I ask what
you're doing in Venice?

37:14.488 --> 37:17.949
I'm addressing a seminar
of the European
Space Commission.

37:18.033 --> 37:19.993
My, heavy stuff.

37:20.077 --> 37:22.203
But there again,
I keep forgetting
that you are

37:22.288 --> 37:24.998
more than just
a very beautiful woman.

37:25.833 --> 37:29.252
If you're trying
to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.

37:29.336 --> 37:31.254
I have more important
things on my mind.

37:31.338 --> 37:33.423
Ah, that's what I'd like
to talk to you about.

37:33.507 --> 37:34.674
Dinner this evening?

37:34.759 --> 37:36.134
This evening I'm
giving my address.

37:37.011 --> 37:38.094
Well, then, can you
think of reason

37:38.179 --> 37:40.013
why we don't have
a drink afterwards?

37:40.931 --> 37:43.683
Not immediately.
But I'm sure I shall.

37:48.063 --> 37:49.397
Franco.

49:03.744 --> 49:05.537
Play it again, Sam.

49:37.445 --> 49:38.904
What the hell
are you doing here?

49:39.030 --> 49:40.489
Convalescing.

49:40.573 --> 49:43.283
Your friend Cha
just tried to kill me.

49:44.452 --> 49:46.119
And you think
I had something
to do with it?

49:46.204 --> 49:48.872
Well, the thought
had flashed across my mind.

49:51.042 --> 49:53.168
What's Drax up to
in that laboratory?

49:53.920 --> 49:56.087
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

49:57.882 --> 49:59.758
You leaving me
your telephone number?

49:59.926 --> 50:01.843
I don't see the point.

50:03.804 --> 50:05.889
Ah, now I do.

50:08.017 --> 50:10.602
Not what I want to
get stuck with tonight.

50:13.022 --> 50:16.358
James, why don't you
pour yourself a drink, huh?

50:16.442 --> 50:18.026
Thank you.

50:21.447 --> 50:23.448
Daily diary.

50:28.955 --> 50:31.289
Fairly deadly diary.

50:32.833 --> 50:34.376
Bollinger.

50:34.460 --> 50:36.336
If it's '69,
you were expecting me.

50:56.274 --> 50:58.608
Trifle overpowering,
your scent.

51:08.327 --> 51:10.954
Standard CIA equipment.

51:11.038 --> 51:13.832
And the CIA placed you
with Drax, correct?

51:13.916 --> 51:15.166
Very astute of you, James.

51:15.334 --> 51:16.585
Oh, not really.

51:16.669 --> 51:18.670
I have friends
in low places.

51:18.754 --> 51:22.507
Could this possibly
be the moment for us
to pool our resources?

51:23.676 --> 51:26.011
It could have
its compensations.

51:40.026 --> 51:42.861
Where are you planning
on going from here?

51:42.945 --> 51:45.697
I'm not planning
on going anywhere.

51:47.825 --> 51:50.285
Oh, I suppose
you're right, Holly.

51:50.411 --> 51:52.871
We would be better
off working together.

51:52.955 --> 51:54.039
Detente?

51:54.123 --> 51:55.540
Agreed.

51:56.083 --> 51:57.417
Understanding?

51:58.044 --> 51:59.377
Possibly.

52:00.004 --> 52:02.005
Cooperation?

52:02.089 --> 52:03.506
Maybe.

52:03.883 --> 52:05.008
Trust?

52:05.301 --> 52:06.384
Out of the question.

52:40.169 --> 52:43.755
Send the night porter up
for my bags immediately,
please.

52:50.346 --> 52:51.846
I hope you know what
you're doing, Bond.

52:51.931 --> 52:53.932
I've played bridge
with this fellow Drax.

52:54.558 --> 52:56.851
007 doesn't usually
push the panic button

52:56.936 --> 52:58.186
unless it's
something serious.

52:58.270 --> 52:59.604
I should hope not.
Good morning, Inspector.

52:59.647 --> 53:01.272
Good morning.
I see you've
covered everything

53:01.357 --> 53:02.357
with our Italian friends.

53:02.441 --> 53:03.650
Yes, sir.

53:16.374 --> 53:18.250
Is this it?
Yes, sir.

53:22.255 --> 53:23.588
Gas masks?

53:23.673 --> 53:26.717
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.

54:01.169 --> 54:03.920
Frederick Gray.
What a surprise.

54:04.005 --> 54:07.507
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.

54:09.093 --> 54:11.261
You must excuse me, gentlemen,
not being English,

54:11.345 --> 54:15.432
I sometimes find
your sense of humor
rather difficult to follow.

54:19.687 --> 54:23.523
On behalf of
the British government,
I apologize.

54:25.902 --> 54:28.779
I think you owe us
an explanation, 007.

54:29.864 --> 54:33.074
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

54:33.159 --> 54:35.452
Your man should be
taken off the assignment.

54:35.536 --> 54:37.579
I'll see you
at the consulate.

54:38.498 --> 54:40.749
I'll have to do
what he says.

54:40.833 --> 54:43.001
Well, before you
do that, sir,

54:43.085 --> 54:45.420
have Q do
an analysis of this.

54:46.923 --> 54:48.715
I took it from
the laboratory.

54:48.800 --> 54:51.343
Tell him to exercise
extreme caution.

54:51.552 --> 54:53.303
It is lethal.

54:53.721 --> 54:55.972
So, there was a laboratory.

54:58.059 --> 55:01.061
You better take two weeks
leave of absence, 007.

55:02.230 --> 55:04.523
Do have any thoughts
about where you might go?

55:04.607 --> 55:08.693
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.

55:08.778 --> 55:11.655
I think I can recall
your mentioning it.

55:11.739 --> 55:16.535
007, no slipups
or we're both in trouble.

55:23.167 --> 55:26.086
Yes, a minor crisis
has been averted.

55:26.170 --> 55:28.630
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise

55:28.714 --> 55:31.883
is to be rerouted
as from today.

55:31.968 --> 55:34.803
Now, regarding
a replacement for Cha,

55:34.887 --> 55:38.014
do you have someone in mind?

55:38.099 --> 55:40.433
Oh, yes, well,
if you can get him,
of course.

55:40.977 --> 55:44.354
<i>Flight BA 128
to Rio de Janeiro</i>

55:44.438 --> 55:47.399
<i>now boarding,
gate number seven.</i>

56:20.641 --> 56:22.684
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.

57:04.852 --> 57:06.645
The President Suite.

57:07.188 --> 57:08.647
Really?

57:09.065 --> 57:10.982
Well, don't bother
showing me the rest.

57:11.067 --> 57:12.859
If I get lost,
I'll take a cab.

57:30.878 --> 57:32.504
Do you come
with the suite?

57:32.588 --> 57:34.422
It depends
who's renting it.

57:34.715 --> 57:37.384
Vodka martini?
Shaken not stirred.

57:39.387 --> 57:41.721
Why were you
following me
from the airport?

57:41.806 --> 57:43.431
I was trying to meet you.

57:43.557 --> 57:45.183
My name is Manuela.

57:45.267 --> 57:47.227
I work for Station VH.

57:47.395 --> 57:49.354
We have been
asked to assist you.

57:49.438 --> 57:51.815
M thinks of everything.

57:51.899 --> 57:55.276
Tell me, Manuela,
do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?

57:55.403 --> 58:00.115
C and W?
Yes, Carlos
and Wilmsberg.

58:00.199 --> 58:02.325
They are very big
importers in Rio.

58:02.410 --> 58:05.330
A subsidiary of
the Drax Group, I believe.

58:05.415 --> 58:08.500
They have a warehouse
on Carioca Avenue.

58:08.584 --> 58:10.711
I'd like to pay it
a discreet visit tonight.

58:10.795 --> 58:15.257
Tonight? I think you may
find that a little difficult.

58:15.341 --> 58:19.886
Difficult or not,
it's something we have to do.

58:19.971 --> 58:22.347
And meanwhile,

58:22.432 --> 58:27.102
how do you kill
five hours in Rio
if you don't samba?

58:53.129 --> 58:55.047
There's the warehouse.

58:55.173 --> 58:57.090
And not a soul about.

58:57.175 --> 58:58.550
I think there's
a way around the back.

58:58.634 --> 59:00.302
Good thinking.

59:34.212 --> 59:35.670
This is it.

59:36.672 --> 59:39.800
Don't talk to
any strange men.
I'll be back.

01:02:32.223 --> 01:02:33.765
Are you all right?

01:02:33.849 --> 01:02:36.476
Yes, but I'd rather
dance with you.

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.771
I did tell you
not to talk to
any strange men.

01:02:41.274 --> 01:02:42.941
Did you find
anything in there?

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.360
Only this.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.154
"Drax Air Freight. "

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:49.698
Do you know which airport
they operate from?

01:02:49.782 --> 01:02:51.116
Yes. San Pietro.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.867
Do you want me
to take you there?

01:02:53.244 --> 01:02:55.954
No, I think
you need some rest.

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.789
Come on.
I'll drop you off.
Okay.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:29.883
Haven't we met
before somewhere?

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:33.512
The face is familiar,
as is the manner.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:37.391
It's become distinctly
chilly since Venice.

01:04:37.475 --> 01:04:39.726
Well, that was before
you walked out on me.

01:04:39.811 --> 01:04:42.354
Yes, nearly tripping over
your suitcase on the way
through the door.

01:04:42.438 --> 01:04:43.730
So?

01:04:43.815 --> 01:04:47.734
So why waste time
working against each other?

01:04:47.819 --> 01:04:50.612
I've checked Drax's
warehouse in town.

01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:52.114
It's empty.

01:04:52.198 --> 01:04:53.615
That's no surprise.
Since I've been here,

01:04:53.699 --> 01:04:56.076
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.702
Yes. He's moving out.

01:04:58.162 --> 01:04:59.788
Where to?

01:05:00.748 --> 01:05:02.582
That's what we're
going to find out,

01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:05.001
now that we're
working together.

01:05:09.882 --> 01:05:12.217
I still don't know
if I trust you.

01:05:12.718 --> 01:05:15.095
I don't know
if I trust you either.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:19.224
That's what makes it
more exciting, doesn't it?

01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:53.258
What's wrong?

01:05:53.843 --> 01:05:55.093
I don't know.

01:05:55.178 --> 01:05:58.054
But I'm sure we're
better off out than in.

01:05:58.973 --> 01:06:00.724
Bring that chain.

01:06:27.752 --> 01:06:29.085
Hang on, James.

01:06:29.962 --> 01:06:32.088
The thought had
occurred to me.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.171
I might have guessed.

01:07:13.256 --> 01:07:14.339
Do you know him?

01:07:14.423 --> 01:07:15.715
Not socially.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.301
His name's Jaws.
He kills people.

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:31.209
Here, give me the chain.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.139
Come on. Hang on to me.

01:09:21.803 --> 01:09:23.095
Jump.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:30.912
Have you broken something?

01:10:30.997 --> 01:10:32.581
Only my tailor's heart.

01:10:37.503 --> 01:10:39.212
What was that for?

01:10:39.338 --> 01:10:41.089
For saving my life.

01:10:41.174 --> 01:10:43.425
Remind me to do it
more often.

01:10:56.022 --> 01:10:58.857
Oh, thank you,
but we're in great shape.

01:12:08.928 --> 01:12:10.929
Sorry about that.

01:14:06.214 --> 01:14:09.299
James! You look
as though you've just
fallen off a mountain.

01:14:09.384 --> 01:14:11.760
Well, it's funny
you should say that,
Moneypenny.

01:14:11.844 --> 01:14:15.597
As a matter of fact,
I was in a cable car and...

01:14:15.682 --> 01:14:17.140
Never mind.

01:14:17.225 --> 01:14:18.517
The other courtyard.

01:14:21.479 --> 01:14:23.647
Ah, there you are, 007.

01:14:23.773 --> 01:14:25.941
Balls, Q?

01:14:26.025 --> 01:14:27.901
Bolas, 007.

01:14:41.124 --> 01:14:44.501
Good. Have that ready
for Army Day.
Yes, sir.

01:14:44.585 --> 01:14:45.585
Where's M?

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:47.087
He's in the office
over there.

01:14:58.725 --> 01:15:00.475
This way.

01:15:02.395 --> 01:15:03.520
Good morning, 007.

01:15:03.646 --> 01:15:04.813
Good morning, sir.

01:15:04.897 --> 01:15:06.982
You're just in time.
Sit down.

01:15:07.483 --> 01:15:09.276
Thank you, sir.

01:15:10.737 --> 01:15:11.862
Q's come up
with something.

01:15:12.113 --> 01:15:13.113
Splendid.

01:15:13.197 --> 01:15:15.198
Any news of Dr. Goodhead?

01:15:15.324 --> 01:15:17.325
Afraid not. Right, Q.

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:19.453
Well, it's a breakdown
on that phial of liquid

01:15:19.537 --> 01:15:21.329
you picked up in Venice.

01:15:21.414 --> 01:15:24.249
You know, you seem
to be right, 007.
Thank you.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:25.876
It's a highly toxic nerve gas

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.336
that appears to have
no effect on animals.

01:15:29.255 --> 01:15:30.297
May I see the formula?

01:15:39.932 --> 01:15:42.559
It's a chemical
formula of a plant.

01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:46.938
<i>Orchideae anegra.</i>

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.857
A very rare orchid indeed.

01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:51.234
Yes. It was thought
to be extinct.

01:15:51.319 --> 01:15:53.028
Until a missionary
brought one back

01:15:53.112 --> 01:15:55.072
from the upper reaches
of the Amazoco.

01:15:55.448 --> 01:15:56.448
Well, actually
he brought it back

01:15:56.532 --> 01:15:58.408
from the area of
the River Tapirape.

01:15:58.493 --> 01:16:00.202
Well done, James.

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:02.412
You better get
up there and fast.

01:16:02.497 --> 01:16:04.456
And I've got something
to get him there,

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.417
if 007 can be trusted
to look after it.

01:24:12.365 --> 01:24:15.325
Mr. Bond, you defy
all my attempts

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:18.078
to plan an amusing
death for you.

01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:20.539
You're not a sportsman,
Mr. Bond.

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:23.709
Why did you break off
the encounter with
my pet python?

01:24:23.793 --> 01:24:26.336
I discovered
he had a crush on me.

01:24:27.171 --> 01:24:28.463
Jaws.

01:24:39.017 --> 01:24:41.560
<i>Moonraker One on
preset launch program,</i>

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.520
<i>minus two minutes.</i>

01:24:43.605 --> 01:24:45.606
<i>Retract crew access arm.</i>

01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:48.025
<i>CAA retracted.</i>

<i>Transfer orbiter power.</i>

01:24:50.194 --> 01:24:52.029
<i>Internal power

<i>Activate hydraulics.</i>

01:24:54.282 --> 01:24:56.074
<i>Hydraulics activated.</i>

<i>Helium flight

01:25:10.506 --> 01:25:13.634
What exactly are
you up to here, Drax?

01:25:13.718 --> 01:25:15.344
And why the orchids?

01:25:15.428 --> 01:25:17.638
The curse of a civilization.

01:25:17.722 --> 01:25:20.641
It was neither
war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race

01:25:20.725 --> 01:25:24.144
who built the great
city lying around us.

01:25:24.395 --> 01:25:27.564
It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:32.194
Because long-term
exposure to its pollen
caused sterility.

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:34.571
Correct, Mr. Bond.

01:25:34.656 --> 01:25:38.408
As you discovered,
I have improved
upon sterility.

01:25:39.369 --> 01:25:42.079
Those same seeds
now yield death.

01:25:43.206 --> 01:25:45.415
Not, of course,
to animals or plant life.

01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:47.834
One must preserve
the balance of nature.

01:25:47.919 --> 01:25:50.545
Moonraker launch program
now commencing.

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.130
<i>Minus 20 seconds.</i>

01:26:09.148 --> 01:26:11.441

<i>Moonraker Three,

Moonraker Five,

Minus ten...

01:27:01.325 --> 01:27:03.744
Drax, one more thing.

01:27:03.953 --> 01:27:06.413
You delivered a shuttle
to the U.S. government,

01:27:06.497 --> 01:27:09.291
then you hijacked it. Why?

01:27:10.752 --> 01:27:13.128
Because I needed it.

01:27:13.212 --> 01:27:17.507
One of my own Moonrakers
developed a fault
during assembly.

01:27:17.967 --> 01:27:21.136
Now, you have
distracted me enough.

01:27:21.512 --> 01:27:25.599
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be
cold after his swim.

01:27:25.683 --> 01:27:28.435
Place him where he can
be assured of warmth.

01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:29.853
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:27:29.937 --> 01:27:32.105

01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:06.056
Thank God,
you're safe.

01:28:06.599 --> 01:28:10.060
<i>Moonraker Five,

Even in death,

When this rocket
lifts off,

01:28:39.801 --> 01:28:42.970
I shall be leaving you
in your own private
crematorium.

01:28:43.471 --> 01:28:47.933
Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead,
I bid you farewell.

01:28:49.102 --> 01:28:51.186

01:29:41.738 --> 01:29:44.156
<i>four, three, two...

01:29:47.827 --> 01:29:49.161
Straight on.

<i>Moonraker Six,

01:30:34.374 --> 01:30:35.707
<i>Confirm.</i>

01:30:36.417 --> 01:30:39.127
<i>We have separation.</i>

01:30:42.507 --> 01:30:44.925
<i>Thrust 6.8 million pounds.</i>

01:31:03.236 --> 01:31:05.320
We're going the wrong way.

<i>three, two, one, go.</i>

01:32:04.338 --> 01:32:07.883
It's all right. We're on
a prearranged flight program.

01:32:58.351 --> 01:33:00.435
That's Drax in
Moonraker Five.

01:33:14.494 --> 01:33:15.786
What about the others?

01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:17.371
I don't know. Let's see.

01:33:21.543 --> 01:33:23.961
We're all on
parallel courses.

01:33:24.045 --> 01:33:26.880
So, we must be headed
for a rendezvous in orbit.

01:34:14.637 --> 01:34:16.847
Let's see what cargo we have.

01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:28.609
The animals
went in two by two.

01:34:28.735 --> 01:34:30.861
What do you mean by that?

01:34:30.945 --> 01:34:33.363
Noah's Ark.
This operation.

01:35:03.144 --> 01:35:04.770
We're converging.

01:35:10.485 --> 01:35:11.818
Control rockets?

01:35:12.153 --> 01:35:13.528
Yes, we're slowing down.

01:35:19.619 --> 01:35:20.994
What's that?

01:35:55.029 --> 01:35:57.656
There's no image
on the radar scanner.

01:36:09.877 --> 01:36:11.795
An entire city in space

01:36:14.424 --> 01:36:17.092
and still nothing
on the radar scanner.

01:36:17.552 --> 01:36:19.970
So nobody on Earth
knows it's there.

01:36:20.054 --> 01:36:21.430
Right.

01:36:22.598 --> 01:36:25.225
Drax must have
a radar-jamming system.

01:36:27.812 --> 01:36:30.981
<i>All Moonrakers
prepare to initiate
docking procedures</i>

01:36:31.065 --> 01:36:33.233
<i>and continue radio silence.</i>

01:36:58.676 --> 01:37:01.011
<i>Moonraker Six,
you are now in manual.</i>

01:37:01.637 --> 01:37:04.014
<i>Initiate docking sequence.</i>

01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:21.198
<i>All shuttles now docked.</i>

01:37:21.324 --> 01:37:23.533
<i>Execute station
activation procedure.</i>

01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:58.255
Gravity, normal conditions.

01:38:58.339 --> 01:39:00.048
Life-support system, nominal.

01:39:02.844 --> 01:39:06.638
<i>Moonraker Six technicians,
commence operational sequence.</i>

01:39:06.973 --> 01:39:08.432
<i>Sequence four initiated.</i>

01:39:08.558 --> 01:39:10.017
<i>Check airlock seals.</i>

01:39:10.101 --> 01:39:12.060
<i>ALS secure.</i>

01:39:19.194 --> 01:39:25.908
<i>All personnel to
Command satellite.</i>

01:39:28.953 --> 01:39:32.164
<i>All crews to M5 segment.</i>

01:39:32.248 --> 01:39:35.959
<i>Moonraker Six
technicians to M2 segment.</i>

01:39:36.044 --> 01:39:39.338
<i>Moonraker One and Three
to M1 segment.</i>

01:39:39.422 --> 01:39:44.009
<i>Moonraker Four and Five
to M4 segment.</i>

01:39:44.093 --> 01:39:47.179
<i>Moonraker Two
to M5 segment.</i>

01:39:48.139 --> 01:39:52.434
<i>Units four and seven,
man console as planned.</i>

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:57.689
<i>Units one,
three, five and six,
assume pre-assigned stations.</i>

01:39:57.774 --> 01:39:58.899
<i>Pressure on-line?</i>

01:39:58.983 --> 01:40:00.067
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:40:00.151 --> 01:40:01.151
<i>Life support?</i>

01:40:01.236 --> 01:40:02.444
<i>Normal.</i>

01:40:06.783 --> 01:40:08.784
Those are the globes
I saw in Venice

01:40:08.868 --> 01:40:10.953
with the nerve gas
phials inside.

01:40:15.667 --> 01:40:18.085
First there was a dream.

01:40:18.878 --> 01:40:21.296
Now there is reality.

01:40:21.464 --> 01:40:25.384
Here in the untainted
cradle of the heavens

01:40:25.468 --> 01:40:28.554
will be created
a new super-race,

01:40:28.638 --> 01:40:33.308
a race of perfect
physical specimens.

01:40:33.393 --> 01:40:38.397
You have been selected
as its progenitors,
like gods.

01:40:38.481 --> 01:40:43.443
Your offspring
will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.

01:40:43.528 --> 01:40:48.198
You have all served
in humble capacities
in my terrestrial empire.

01:40:48.283 --> 01:40:50.409
Your seed, like yourselves,

01:40:50.493 --> 01:40:53.120
will pay deference
to the ultimate dynasty

01:40:53.204 --> 01:40:56.164
which I alone have created.

01:40:56.541 --> 01:41:01.378
From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up

01:41:01.504 --> 01:41:07.009
and know that there is
law and order in the heavens.

01:41:09.554 --> 01:41:12.389
<i>All units,
start Operation Orchid.</i>

01:41:17.312 --> 01:41:20.314
If we were
visible from Earth,
they'd investigate.

01:41:20.398 --> 01:41:23.317
Where do you suppose
that radar-jamming system is?

01:41:23.401 --> 01:41:27.321
We didn't pass
anything on the way here,
so let's try this way.

01:41:28.948 --> 01:41:31.658
<i>Station two,
check coordinates,
mode four.</i>

01:41:33.244 --> 01:41:36.788
<i>Initiate globe launch
timing sequence.</i>

01:41:36.873 --> 01:41:39.166
Orbital communicator,
level 10.

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:40.792
Zero gravity.

01:42:05.151 --> 01:42:07.736
This is it,
the radar-jamming system.

01:42:10.698 --> 01:42:13.241
<i>Coordinate
conversion program.</i>

01:42:13.576 --> 01:42:15.494
<i>Check.</i>

01:42:15.578 --> 01:42:17.245
<i>Side lobe gain.</i>

01:42:17.914 --> 01:42:19.081
<i>Check.</i>

01:42:19.165 --> 01:42:20.832
<i>Spectral response.</i>

01:42:21.084 --> 01:42:22.417
<i>Check.</i>

01:42:23.044 --> 01:42:25.420
<i>Spin stabilizer
correction factor.</i>

01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:28.006
<i>Okay.</i>

01:42:28.091 --> 01:42:30.425
<i>Gigahertz
reflector efficiency.</i>

01:42:32.845 --> 01:42:34.596
<i>Solar photon screen.</i>

01:42:56.244 --> 01:42:58.537
Where did you learn
to fight like that?
NASA?

01:42:58.621 --> 01:42:59.996
No, Vassar.

01:43:10.967 --> 01:43:11.967
Switched off?

01:43:12.051 --> 01:43:13.093
Permanently.

01:43:13.177 --> 01:43:14.177
Now we can be
spotted from Earth.

01:43:18.643 --> 01:43:20.644
This doesn't
look good at all.

01:43:20.770 --> 01:43:22.730
It's over 200
meters in diameter.

01:43:22.814 --> 01:43:25.232
Yes, yes.

01:43:25.316 --> 01:43:28.527
Will you please listen,
General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.

01:43:28.611 --> 01:43:30.738
Neither did we,
Colonel Scott.

01:43:30.822 --> 01:43:33.323
So what are you suggesting?

01:43:33.783 --> 01:43:35.242
We've taken action already.

01:43:35.326 --> 01:43:37.161
We're sending up
a vehicle to intercept.

01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:41.248
Very well, but if we
don't hear from you
in the next 12 hours

01:43:41.332 --> 01:43:44.877
we take action ourselves
and hold you responsible
for the consequences.

01:43:46.504 --> 01:43:49.047
We'll be in touch,
General.

01:43:49.132 --> 01:43:50.549
Sorry to have woken you.

01:43:50.633 --> 01:43:52.092
I was already awake.

01:43:53.261 --> 01:43:57.556
How can I sleep?
Nothing but problems.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.559
Problems, problems.

01:44:01.770 --> 01:44:04.104
<i>Marine
astronauts to launch pad.</i>

01:44:12.238 --> 01:44:14.823
Launch
pre-program complete, sir.

01:44:15.366 --> 01:44:17.993
Launch globe number one.

01:45:13.091 --> 01:45:15.801
T. D. R.S.S.
reports a launch, sir.

01:45:15.927 --> 01:45:18.720
Continental U.S.A.
Vandenberg.

01:45:21.933 --> 01:45:23.934
There are no
launches scheduled.

01:45:24.686 --> 01:45:26.645
Check radar-jamming system.

01:45:29.232 --> 01:45:30.232
Well?

01:45:30.316 --> 01:45:33.527
Jamming power supply
and backup have failed, sir.

01:45:33.611 --> 01:45:35.153
Investigate immediately.

01:45:35.238 --> 01:45:37.114
Investigate
number 28, immediately.

01:45:39.409 --> 01:45:41.785
James Bond.

01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:47.124
You appear with
the tedious inevitability
of an unloved season.

01:45:47.208 --> 01:45:50.002
I didn't think
there were any
seasons in space.

01:45:50.086 --> 01:45:53.547
As far as you're concerned,
only winter.

01:45:53.631 --> 01:45:56.633
And the treacherous
Dr. Goodhead.

01:45:56.718 --> 01:46:01.096
Despite your efforts,
my finely wrought dream
approaches its fulfillment.

01:46:01.556 --> 01:46:06.226
Your dream, whatever
sort of nightmare it is,
hasn't a chance, Drax.

01:46:06.311 --> 01:46:09.438
You think not?
We shall see.

01:46:09.522 --> 01:46:12.024
We're coming up to
second launch position.

01:46:12.108 --> 01:46:14.067
Launch globe number two.

01:46:25.455 --> 01:46:29.791
No doubt you have
realized the splendor
of my conception.

01:46:29.876 --> 01:46:33.420
First, a necklace of
death about the Earth.

01:46:33.504 --> 01:46:39.468
50 globes,
each releasing its nerve gas
over a designated area,

01:46:39.552 --> 01:46:43.597
each capable of
killing 100 million people.

01:46:43.681 --> 01:46:49.394
And the human race
as you know it
will cease to exist.

01:46:49.562 --> 01:46:54.107
Then a rebirth,
a new world.

01:46:54.192 --> 01:46:56.902
U.S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:00.530
Activate laser.

01:47:01.032 --> 01:47:02.741
Prepare to
destroy spacecraft.

01:47:16.881 --> 01:47:18.966
You see, my dear Bond,
we're well able

01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:21.426
to protect ourselves
against all enemies.

01:47:24.305 --> 01:47:29.059
Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.

01:47:29.268 --> 01:47:34.314
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.

01:47:40.947 --> 01:47:42.489
And you, Dr. Goodhead.

01:47:42.573 --> 01:47:45.283
Your desire to be
America's first
woman in space

01:47:45.368 --> 01:47:47.327
will shortly be fulfilled.

01:47:47.412 --> 01:47:50.038
Leaving you on
your flying stud farm,

01:47:50.164 --> 01:47:52.833
conceiving your
new master race?

01:47:52.917 --> 01:47:55.127
If you like, yes.

01:47:55.211 --> 01:47:57.087
And of course,
anyone not measuring up

01:47:57.171 --> 01:47:59.798
to your standards of
physical perfection

01:48:00.675 --> 01:48:02.592
will be exterminated.

01:48:03.886 --> 01:48:05.762
Certainly.

01:48:06.973 --> 01:48:09.850
Interesting.

01:48:09.934 --> 01:48:11.309
Most interesting.

01:48:11.394 --> 01:48:14.438
Jaws, expel them.

01:48:20.613 --> 01:48:22.614
Jaws! You obey me!

01:48:28.955 --> 01:48:30.289
Expel them!

01:48:43.178 --> 01:48:44.511
Hold them!

01:48:47.932 --> 01:48:50.976
Sir, U.S. spacecraft,
three minutes to intercept.

01:48:51.686 --> 01:48:53.479
Stand by to laser it.

01:49:02.614 --> 01:49:04.198
<i>Initiate firing sequence.</i>

01:49:04.324 --> 01:49:05.991
<i>Initiating.</i>

01:49:06.242 --> 01:49:10.454
<i>U.S.
spacecraft in laser range,
25.5 and closing.</i>

01:49:10.914 --> 01:49:13.415
<i>Range 15.</i>

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:14.833
<i>Range 10.</i>

01:49:19.714 --> 01:49:24.176
<i>Prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two...</i>

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.367
It's stopped rotating.

01:50:25.572 --> 01:50:27.531
Open the cargo doors.

01:50:33.663 --> 01:50:36.665
Number one platoon, EVA.

01:50:36.749 --> 01:50:38.750
<i>Number one platoon, EVA.</i>

01:51:36.643 --> 01:51:37.768
Let's try docking.

01:52:13.596 --> 01:52:16.473
Colonel Scott will
take the first landing!

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.685
Intruders
have docked at satellite
seven, sir.

01:52:19.769 --> 01:52:23.355
Double the guard
at every entrance
in this satellite.

01:52:23.481 --> 01:52:26.233
Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.

01:52:26.359 --> 01:52:29.695
Number three globe
ready for launching, sir.
Proceed!

01:52:40.331 --> 01:52:42.541
<i>Group One, attack enemy.</i>

01:52:42.625 --> 01:52:44.376
<i>All units shoot to kill.</i>

01:52:52.385 --> 01:52:54.219
Colonel Scott,
don't shoot.
Hold your fire.

01:52:54.887 --> 01:52:56.972
<i>Corridor five penetrated.</i>

01:52:57.056 --> 01:52:59.975
<i>Intruders advancing on
Command satellite.</i>

01:53:00.059 --> 01:53:02.436
<i>Maintenance crew needed,
section three.</i>

01:54:09.339 --> 01:54:10.756
At least I shall
have the pleasure

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.883
of putting you
out of my misery.

01:54:16.596 --> 01:54:18.347
Desolated, Mr. Bond?

01:54:22.685 --> 01:54:24.561
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.

01:54:26.815 --> 01:54:28.107
Allow me.

01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.611
Take a giant
step for mankind.

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.337
Where's Drax?

01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:52.047
Oh, he had to fly.

01:54:52.674 --> 01:54:53.715
How's Scott doing?

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:54.967
He's got control
of the Command satellite.

01:54:55.051 --> 01:54:57.386
We put the launching gear
for the globes out of action.

01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:00.848
When the station breaks up,
they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.

01:55:00.932 --> 01:55:02.975
But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.

01:55:03.059 --> 01:55:05.394
Those three
must be destroyed.

01:55:17.449 --> 01:55:18.699
Come on!

01:55:26.332 --> 01:55:27.875
Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.

01:55:27.959 --> 01:55:30.002
Your mission is completed.

01:55:30.086 --> 01:55:32.754
Sergeant, round up your men,
get them back to the shuttle.
Fast!

01:55:32.839 --> 01:55:33.964
Back to the shuttle,
everybody!

01:55:34.048 --> 01:55:35.132
On the double!

01:56:00.867 --> 01:56:02.284
Moonraker Five,
that's the answer.

01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:03.827
Drax's shuttle is
armed with a laser.

01:56:03.912 --> 01:56:06.371
We can track those globes
and destroy them.

01:56:08.958 --> 01:56:11.960
It's hopeless, sir.
The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.

01:56:12.045 --> 01:56:13.795
All right, let's go.

01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:04.012
Docking release
system is jammed.

01:57:31.874 --> 01:57:35.711
Release the door lock.
I'll see if I can
operate it manually.

01:57:35.795 --> 01:57:37.379
It's jammed too.

01:57:52.604 --> 01:57:54.396
Well, here's to us.

01:58:10.455 --> 01:58:14.207
Jaws, we can't disengage.
The docking release
system is jammed.

01:58:14.292 --> 01:58:16.251
Can you help us?

01:58:40.779 --> 01:58:42.154
We're free.

01:58:57.796 --> 01:58:59.004
Don't worry,
they'll make it.

01:58:59.089 --> 01:59:00.923
It's only 100 miles to Earth.

01:59:01.675 --> 01:59:03.258
Let's get a read-out
on those globes.

01:59:25.365 --> 01:59:26.573
I have the three globes
on the screen.

01:59:26.658 --> 01:59:28.909
We should have
a visual in a minute.

01:59:38.628 --> 01:59:40.045
There it is.

01:59:43.133 --> 01:59:47.803
The laser's on automatic.
Code 945 set.

02:00:03.319 --> 02:00:05.112
One down, two to go.

02:00:08.908 --> 02:00:10.993
Number two straight ahead.

02:00:18.334 --> 02:00:19.293
What is it?

02:00:19.377 --> 02:00:21.628
We're skipping on
the Earth's atmosphere.

02:00:21.713 --> 02:00:23.005
In range.

02:00:32.682 --> 02:00:35.017
We should see
the last one soon.

02:00:36.269 --> 02:00:38.645
There it is.

02:00:47.322 --> 02:00:49.281
It's getting hot.
It can't be helped.

02:00:49.365 --> 02:00:51.116
I'm coming in
at a steeper angle
than I should

02:00:51.201 --> 02:00:53.118
in order to catch
that last globe.

02:01:00.627 --> 02:01:03.045
I can't hold this
course much longer.

02:01:03.171 --> 02:01:05.589
We'll break up
at 200,000 feet.

02:01:05.673 --> 02:01:07.382
Just a few seconds more.

02:01:17.685 --> 02:01:19.895
Automatic firing
system negative.

02:01:20.355 --> 02:01:22.606
Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.

02:01:37.413 --> 02:01:39.498
Controls aren't responding.

02:01:42.585 --> 02:01:44.253
The wings are
beginning to glow.

02:01:44.462 --> 02:01:46.213
Just hold her steady.

02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:49.758
Steady.

02:02:04.357 --> 02:02:06.441
It's entering
Earth's atmosphere!

02:02:07.318 --> 02:02:09.444
James, this is
our last chance.

02:02:12.198 --> 02:02:13.407
Steady.

02:02:32.635 --> 02:02:33.927
Colonel Scott
reports picking up

02:02:34.012 --> 02:02:35.637
two survivors from
the space station,

02:02:36.055 --> 02:02:38.181
a tall man and
a short blonde woman.

02:02:38.266 --> 02:02:40.976
Right. Okay.

02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.645
Dr. Goodhead reported
their position 20 minutes ago.

02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:46.815
They're just coming into
range of our tracking ship
in the Pacific Ocean.

02:02:46.941 --> 02:02:48.400
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes

02:02:48.484 --> 02:02:50.152
from the remote
onboard TV monitors.

02:02:54.073 --> 02:02:56.074
<i>Houston calling Dr. Goodhead.</i>

02:02:56.159 --> 02:02:58.785
<i>Houston calling.
Confirm your position.</i>

02:03:04.667 --> 02:03:08.128
As this is the first
joint venture between
our two countries,

02:03:08.212 --> 02:03:09.546
I'm having it
patched directly

02:03:09.631 --> 02:03:11.798
to the White House
and Buckingham Palace.

02:03:11.883 --> 02:03:14.843
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.

02:03:14.928 --> 02:03:16.011
We have audiovisual.

02:03:16.095 --> 02:03:17.262
Ah, at last.

02:03:27.525 --> 02:03:29.360
007.

02:03:29.527 --> 02:03:31.362
My God, what's Bond doing?

02:03:31.446 --> 02:03:34.073
I think he's attempting
re-entry, sir.

02:03:47.295 --> 02:03:48.545
James?

02:03:48.630 --> 02:03:50.297
I think it may be
time to go home.

02:03:51.049 --> 02:03:54.218
Take me round the world
one more time.

02:03:54.302 --> 02:03:55.552
Why not?

02:04:03.728 --> 02:04:06.438
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:04:07.691 --> 02:04:10.734
<i>Why do you hide?</i>

02:04:11.653 --> 02:04:14.321
<i>Where is that moonlight trail</i>

02:04:14.406 --> 02:04:17.032
<i>That leads to your side?</i>

02:04:17.117 --> 02:04:21.996
<i>Just like the Moonraker goes</i>

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.375
<i>In search of his dream of gold</i>

02:04:26.501 --> 02:04:30.045
<i>I search for love</i>

02:04:30.255 --> 02:04:34.091
<i>For someone to have and hold</i>

02:04:34.175 --> 02:04:37.678
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

02:04:37.929 --> 02:04:42.099
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

02:04:42.434 --> 02:04:45.060
<i>Felt your touch</i>

02:04:45.854 --> 02:04:50.024
<i>And it always seems</i>

02:04:50.108 --> 02:04:59.408
<i>You love me</i>

02:05:07.125 --> 02:05:10.502
<i>Where are you?</i>

02:05:11.046 --> 02:05:14.840
<i>When will we meet?</i>

02:05:15.091 --> 02:05:17.718
<i>Take my unfinished life</i>

02:05:17.802 --> 02:05:20.471
<i>And make it complete</i>

02:05:20.555 --> 02:05:25.392
<i>Just like the Moonraker knows</i>

02:05:25.518 --> 02:05:29.396
<i>His dream will
come true someday</i>

02:05:30.148 --> 02:05:33.442
<i>I know that you</i>

02:05:33.526 --> 02:05:37.237
<i>Are only a kiss away</i>

02:05:37.322 --> 02:05:41.075
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

02:05:41.159 --> 02:05:44.828
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

02:05:45.747 --> 02:05:49.166
<i>Felt your touch</i>

02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:53.045
<i>And it always seems</i>

02:05:54.305 --> 02:06:00.172
