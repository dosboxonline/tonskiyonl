(UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:30.238 --> 00:31.781
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

00:32.532 --> 00:35.535
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.495
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

00:37.579 --> 00:39.706
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.292
Thanks.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.714
I read all about your accident.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.884
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.595
So you're saying that the Hulk
saved my life?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.222
Bruce.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.932
BANNER: Saved it for what?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.185
I guess we'll find out.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.230
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.857
That's my secret, Captain.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.067
I'm always angry.

I am a god,
and I will not be bullied by... (YELPS)

01:19.913 --> 01:21.081
Puny god.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.874
Hey, big guy.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.209
(GROWLS)

01:25.335 --> 01:26.586
Sun's getting real low.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.635
ROMANOFF: The lullaby
worked better than ever.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.762
BANNER: Just wasn't expecting
a code green.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.098
ROMANOFF: How long before you trust me?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.641
It's not you I don't trust.

01:40.683 --> 01:41.935
(GRUNTS)

01:42.185 --> 01:45.897
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.194
Where in the world
am I not a threat?

01:51.277 --> 01:53.822
-You're not a threat to me.
-BANNER: Are you sure?

01:55.615 --> 01:56.616
(RUMBLING)

01:56.699 --> 01:57.700
We gotta move.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.452
You're not gonna turn green?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.746
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.206
I adore you.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.000
(ROMANOFF GRUNTS)

ROMANOFF: (OVER PA)
Hey, big guy. We did it.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.983
The job is finished.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.818
We can't track you in stealth mode.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.572
So help me out. I need you...

02:39.325 --> 02:41.411
FURY: Probably jumped out
and swam to Fiji.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.872
He'll send a postcard.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.665
"Wish you were here."

02:45.957 --> 02:47.584
What have you brought today? Tell me.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.668
A contender.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.713
(ROARING)

02:53.715 --> 02:55.800
-Yes!
-(ROARS)

02:55.884 --> 02:58.720
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you.

THOR: If you help me get back to Asgard,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.444
I can help you get back to Earth.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.570
Earth hate Hulk.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.696
THOR: Earth loves Hulk.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.656
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.117
-Friend stay.
-No, no, no!

03:21.576 --> 03:23.578
ROMANOFF: Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.455
We can't track you in stealth mode.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.708
HULK: No, Banner!

03:41.304 --> 03:42.805
THOR: Banner, listen.
BANNER: What?

03:42.889 --> 03:45.183
THOR: Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.143
-BANNER: I've been Hulk for two years?
-(ROARS)

03:47.227 --> 03:48.228
THOR: I'm afraid so.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.521
The whole thing
is totally different this time.

03:50.605 --> 03:54.150
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.862
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.948
No Banner. Only Hulk.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.950
THOR: I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.076
Thank you.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.245
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
What do you say?

04:07.163 --> 04:10.041
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.376
Talk about an adventure.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.132
Go back!

Everything's gonna be all right now.

BANNER: If he gets his hands
on all six Stones, Tony...

05:06.389 --> 05:09.600
DR. STRANGE: He could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.935
One to go.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.103
Tell me his name again.

Thanos.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.528
Hulk! What are you doing to me?

No!

05:27.910 --> 05:29.495
What do you mean, "no"?

SMART HULK: Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.463
Except it was worse for me...
'cause I lost twice.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.759
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...
and then, we all lost.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.093
No one blamed you, Bruce.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.178
I did.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.181
For years, I've been treating the Hulk
like he's some kind of disease...

05:48.264 --> 05:49.432
something to get rid of.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.894
But then, I start looking at him
as the cure.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.772
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.191
I put the brains and the brawn together...

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
and now, look at me.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.361
Best of both worlds.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.614
ROGERS: All right. We have a plan.

06:05.406 --> 06:09.619
Six stones, three teams, one shot.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.804
We have to make it worth it.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.058
ROCKET: All right. The glove's ready.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.852
Question is,
who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

06:34.936 --> 06:35.978
It's gotta be me.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.564
The radiation's mostly gamma.

06:38.898 --> 06:43.861
It's like... I was made for this.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.324

I think it worked.

SMART HULK: Once we're done
with the stones...

07:03.714 --> 07:07.343
we can return each one to its own timeline
at the moment it was taken.

07:07.718 --> 07:14.642
So, chronologically... in that reality...
it never left.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.187
ANCIENT ONE: Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.859
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.445
We will. I will. I promise.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.322
ANCIENT ONE: I'm counting on you, Bruce.
