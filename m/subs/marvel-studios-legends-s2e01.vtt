00:28.528 --> 00:31.239
How about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

00:31.906 --> 00:32.991
Who the hell are you?

00:33.658 --> 00:34.659
I'm Ant-Man.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.495
-"Ant-Man"?
-What? You haven't heard of me?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.081
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

00:40.957 --> 00:41.958
Located the breach.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.835
-Bringing him in.
-ANT-MAN: Sorry about this!

some sort of shrinking tech.

ANT-MAN: Sorry!

00:56.973 --> 01:00.226
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.441
SCOTT: <i>I'm not going back.</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:08.693
I got a daughter to take care of.

-Mommy?
-MAGGIE: Hmm.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.489
Is Daddy a bad man?

01:13.281 --> 01:16.201
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.870
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

01:18.953 --> 01:21.289
I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

01:21.831 --> 01:22.832
I'm gonna be fine.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.889
No way.

-No, no, no. Wait!
-No!

01:40.308 --> 01:41.309
Daddy!

01:41.893 --> 01:43.061
You can't just show up.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.646
I wanna be a part of her life.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.981
MAGGIE: <i>Get a job, pay child support.</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:49.192
<i>And then we will talk about visitation.</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:51.945

01:59.619 --> 02:00.703
There's nothing here.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.831
It's an old motorcycle suit.

What do you want me to do?

02:26.771 --> 02:29.190
I want you to break into a place
and steal some stuff.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.486
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.739

Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos

02:42.078 --> 02:43.079
The ants.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.748
-They're not listening to me.
-Think of Cassie.

I'm not sure.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.766
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!

04:26.891 --> 04:28.685
Why can't you leave my daddy alone?

04:28.768 --> 04:32.438
Your school has rules, right?
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.359
Your daddy went to Germany

Five years ago...
