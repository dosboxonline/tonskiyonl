13:59.217 --> 14:01.690
Of course, I know your father.

14:11.437 --> 14:12.909
Avner.

14:14.482 --> 14:17.724
- It's been...
- Two years since I worked for you.

14:17.819 --> 14:20.667
I remember. Please, sit down.

14:21.698 --> 14:23.253
Harari.

14:23.783 --> 14:25.588
General Nadav.

14:25.993 --> 14:27.966
And General Yariv.

14:28.454 --> 14:30.695
How are you? How is your father?

14:30.790 --> 14:32.846
He's fine. Thank you.

14:34.544 --> 14:37.619
Coffee? It's wonderful to see you again.

14:37.714 --> 14:39.102
Sit.

14:41.884 --> 14:44.000
The chief of the Mossad, two generals...

14:44.095 --> 14:47.152
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

14:49.517 --> 14:51.466
This is something new.

14:51.561 --> 14:54.325
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

14:56.607 --> 15:00.165
We want to ask you.
Will you undertake a mission?

15:00.611 --> 15:03.770
An important mission.
You will have to leave the country...

15:03.865 --> 15:06.147
and your family, maybe for years.

15:06.242 --> 15:09.150
- And it is dangerous.
- You can't talk about it to anyone.

15:09.245 --> 15:11.176
Not even your wife.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.183
Now you should say something.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.311
Do you have any questions?

15:23.134 --> 15:26.775
So, this isn't about guarding
tourists on El Al jets?

15:29.140 --> 15:30.862
No questions?

15:31.058 --> 15:33.823
Did we mention how dangerous it is?

15:34.103 --> 15:36.826
You know, my sister died on Tuesday.

15:36.939 --> 15:39.430
- No, I didn't know that.
- Cancer.

15:39.525 --> 15:41.933
I couldn't go to
the athletes' funerals...

15:42.028 --> 15:43.833
because she died.

15:45.198 --> 15:48.254
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

15:49.494 --> 15:51.341
Family matters.

15:55.541 --> 15:59.075
- Your wife is pregnant.
- Yes, seven months.

15:59.170 --> 16:00.683
Mazel tov.

16:01.214 --> 16:03.454
You were one of my favorite bodyguards.

16:03.549 --> 16:06.564
You know, I like neat, durable men.

16:06.844 --> 16:09.901
You liked having the son
of a hero around.

16:11.390 --> 16:14.215
Truth be told,
you don't look much like your father.

16:14.310 --> 16:15.740
No?

16:17.563 --> 16:20.203
Your mother is who you resemble.

16:38.793 --> 16:40.723
Tomorrow morning.

16:40.962 --> 16:43.643
If you can't decide in one day...

16:44.215 --> 16:46.104
you can't decide.

16:55.768 --> 16:57.133
Her sister died.

16:57.228 --> 16:59.802
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

16:59.897 --> 17:01.554
because some people are angry at her...

17:01.649 --> 17:04.580
for not negotiating with the terrorists.

17:12.076 --> 17:13.523
She didn't go to the funerals...

17:13.618 --> 17:15.859
because she didn't want to be booed.

17:15.954 --> 17:18.279
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

17:18.374 --> 17:19.739
You'll say yes.

17:19.834 --> 17:23.348
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

17:24.755 --> 17:27.561

17:48.779 --> 17:52.879

you have to stop having sex?

17:54.952 --> 17:56.466
Labor.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.274
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

18:14.847 --> 18:16.361
Will you?

18:18.643 --> 18:21.133
Whatever they want,
make sure they give you a raise.

18:21.228 --> 18:23.553
I need things for the baby.

18:23.648 --> 18:26.162
I can't live with refusing this.

18:27.818 --> 18:30.833
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

18:31.155 --> 18:33.771
- She abandoned you on that kibbutz.
- She didn't abandon me.

18:33.866 --> 18:35.273
My father was missing.

18:35.368 --> 18:37.692
He was in prison, she was overwhelmed.

18:37.787 --> 18:40.653
- Oh, yes.
- She did what anybody would do.

18:40.748 --> 18:44.347
Yeah, so she took you to the
kibbutz and abandoned you.

18:44.919 --> 18:47.725
Now you think Israel is your mother.

18:54.387 --> 18:56.025
So listen.

18:56.889 --> 19:00.196
I'm going to go along with this,
until I don't.

19:01.268 --> 19:04.492
- Do you understand me?
- I love you.

19:07.566 --> 19:10.039
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

19:15.908 --> 19:20.341
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

19:21.205 --> 19:24.196
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits, or pensions...

19:24.291 --> 19:26.991
or legal aid or medical assistance.

19:27.086 --> 19:30.143
It's a contract that
there is no contract.

19:30.589 --> 19:32.496
- Do I get a copy?
- You don't.

19:32.591 --> 19:35.231
Your pension contribution refund.

19:35.553 --> 19:37.627
You're now officially unofficial.

19:37.722 --> 19:39.986
Unemployed and uninsured.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.798
You'll open two accounts...

19:42.893 --> 19:45.176
at the Union de
Banques Suisse in Geneva...

19:45.271 --> 19:46.719
on Rue du Commerce.

19:46.814 --> 19:50.348
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

19:50.443 --> 19:52.600
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

19:52.695 --> 19:54.352
when you get what accumulates.

19:54.447 --> 19:57.271
Also, for each of your men,
you open an account for his salary.

19:57.366 --> 20:01.359
- How many men do I have for this...
- In the operational funds box...

20:01.454 --> 20:05.553
we will deposit 250,000
American dollars.

20:05.791 --> 20:08.574
You take it out, we put more in.

20:08.669 --> 20:11.077
I want receipts.

20:11.172 --> 20:13.162
You are not working for
the Baron Rothschild.

20:13.257 --> 20:15.539
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

20:15.634 --> 20:19.126
I'm an old Galicianer from
a mud hut in the Ukraine.

20:19.221 --> 20:21.796
And I don't trust Yekke
putzes let loose in Europe...

20:21.891 --> 20:24.048
with unlimited operational expenses.

20:24.143 --> 20:26.550
I was born in Israel. I'm not a Yekke.

20:26.645 --> 20:29.619
- Where is your grandpa from?
- Frankfurt.

20:29.815 --> 20:31.597
You're a Yekke.

20:31.692 --> 20:36.018
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

20:36.113 --> 20:39.730
Also, we leave messages in the
box with the operational funds.

20:39.825 --> 20:41.798
You can leave messages for us.

20:42.620 --> 20:46.636
- But there shouldn't be messages.
- I don't care about that.

20:46.957 --> 20:50.950
- Bring me receipts, you got me?
- I got you.

20:51.045 --> 20:55.144
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying for it.

20:58.552 --> 21:00.418
We have 11 Palestinian names.

21:00.513 --> 21:02.545

21:02.640 --> 21:05.423
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

21:05.518 --> 21:06.757
They're all in Europe now.

21:06.852 --> 21:08.300
You'll stay there as long as it takes.

21:08.395 --> 21:11.470
Europe only, not the Arab countries.
That's for us, not you.

21:11.565 --> 21:13.723
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

21:13.818 --> 21:15.540
Who needs it?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.876
You'll have no contact with us.

21:18.989 --> 21:21.439
You're not going to
give me any information?

21:21.534 --> 21:23.941
We deposit money from a
fund that doesn't exist...

21:24.036 --> 21:27.111
into a box we don't know about,
in a bank we never set foot in.

21:27.206 --> 21:29.739
We can't help you because we
never heard of you before.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.490
You'll do what the terrorists do.

21:31.585 --> 21:35.184
You think they report back to home base?
They don't.

21:35.506 --> 21:37.395
We want them dead.

21:37.925 --> 21:40.374
Nothing better than eating
something sweet by the sea.

21:40.469 --> 21:42.334
You can ask questions now.

21:42.429 --> 21:44.628
- Am I alone?
- Four others.

21:44.723 --> 21:47.548
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

21:47.643 --> 21:48.924

21:49.019 --> 21:50.134
accidentally drop your fake passport...

21:50.229 --> 21:53.369
next to the dead body.
You're the team leader.

21:55.693 --> 21:58.601
- Who kills the targets?
- You do. Who else?

21:58.696 --> 22:01.145
Use guns if you have to,
but the bombs are preferable.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.272
One of your guys knows how to make them.

22:03.367 --> 22:06.650
We want everyone to read in Le Monde
some famous Arab terrorist is dead.

22:06.745 --> 22:08.319
Who knows who blew him up?

22:08.414 --> 22:11.072
- Why me?
- So what's wrong with you?

22:11.167 --> 22:14.056
I'm not an experienced field operative.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.560
- So I'm not known.
- Not even I know you now.

22:17.756 --> 22:19.955
And also, I lived in Frankfurt
when I was a kid...

22:20.050 --> 22:22.333
so I'm a Yekke Jew who knows
his way around Europe.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.669
That's a good reason.
Here's one more. You're ordinary.

22:25.764 --> 22:27.755
You aren't a sabra Charles Bronson.

22:27.850 --> 22:29.548
- I am a sabra.
- I know.

22:29.643 --> 22:32.009
I know so much about you.
You're a nice sabra...

22:32.104 --> 22:35.137
with a dog and a baby on the way.
You won't shoot Spanish bellhops.

22:35.232 --> 22:37.181
No bellhops. No civilians.

22:37.276 --> 22:39.600
That kind of trouble we can't afford.

22:39.695 --> 22:42.061
The hard thing will not be finding them.

22:42.156 --> 22:44.188
Some of them, anyway,
are not so carefully hidden.

22:44.283 --> 22:46.690
The hard thing will be not
punishing yourselves...

22:46.785 --> 22:49.110

- You want the last piece of baklava?
- No.

Munich for the struggle...

43:44.709 --> 43:46.949
and the Germans said yes, instantly.

43:47.044 --> 43:50.244

Are you going to visit your father?

56:04.948 --> 56:07.106
Why is this taking so long?

56:07.201 --> 56:09.006
It isn't fast.

56:09.453 --> 56:12.051
We have the best hospitals in the world.

56:12.998 --> 56:17.014
When you were born, your father
was elsewhere. I was alone.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.850
He was in prison.

56:22.132 --> 56:24.146
Should you be here?

56:24.259 --> 56:26.273
Aren't you on duty?

56:26.595 --> 56:29.443
What are you going to do? Turn me in?

56:30.933 --> 56:32.571
How is he?

56:33.143 --> 56:35.300
I don't visit your father so much.

56:35.395 --> 56:37.928
Wilma lets him yell at her all the time.

56:38.023 --> 56:39.995
She depresses me.

56:45.197 --> 56:46.919
How are you?

56:47.950 --> 56:51.006
I'm managing. Don't worry about me.

56:55.082 --> 56:57.721
I'm proud of what you are doing.

56:58.001 --> 57:00.516
You don't know what I'm doing.

57:10.347 --> 57:14.655
I look at you and I know
everything I need to know.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.368
AVNER: She is frighteningly ugly.

57:19.856 --> 57:21.954
She takes after you.

57:22.693 --> 57:25.100
I want you to move, for a time.

57:25.195 --> 57:27.644
I've arranged a place
for us in Brooklyn.

57:27.739 --> 57:29.938
I can't come back to Israel.
I don't know how long for...

57:30.033 --> 57:31.148
New York?

57:31.243 --> 57:34.318
- I can see more of you this way.
- New York City?

57:34.413 --> 57:35.718
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

57:36.915 --> 57:40.598
But I have my family here,
and your parents.

57:41.378 --> 57:44.203
You want my parents to help raise her?

57:44.298 --> 57:46.604
Look what they did to me.

57:47.509 --> 57:50.858
Don't you want your daughter
to be an Israeli, Avner?

57:52.055 --> 57:54.463
She'll always be an Israeli.

57:54.558 --> 57:57.466
Not in Brooklyn.
She'll just be another homeless Jew.

57:57.561 --> 57:59.968
I can't do what
I'm doing if I can't see you.

58:00.063 --> 58:02.077
What are you doing?

58:03.567 --> 58:06.707
Don't do it then, Avner.
This is our home.

58:06.987 --> 58:09.627
You're the only home I ever had.

58:10.198 --> 58:11.587
What?

58:12.993 --> 58:14.608
This is so corny.

58:14.703 --> 58:17.069
- It wasn't easy for me to say that.
- I bet.

58:17.164 --> 58:19.321
Don't laugh at me then.

58:19.416 --> 58:22.157
Why did I have to marry
a sentimentalist?

58:22.252 --> 58:24.433
You're ruining my life.

58:24.546 --> 58:26.852
Your mother's teasing me.

58:39.895 --> 58:42.576
Look at the waistline bulge on that guy.

58:42.731 --> 58:45.663
Look at that.
Think he might be armed, eh?

58:45.859 --> 58:47.915
As are the Russians.

58:48.445 --> 58:50.519
It's definitely him.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.753
Hussein Abad al-Chir.

58:52.949 --> 58:55.839
His room is next to Israeli newlyweds.

58:56.161 --> 58:58.485
They married in Cyprus
because she's not Jewish.

58:58.580 --> 58:59.987
A mixed marriage.

59:00.082 --> 59:01.530
A shande for the goyim.

59:01.625 --> 59:04.223
Yeah, okay.
But let's try not to blow them up.

59:04.461 --> 59:07.244
The KGB brings him home
every night after dark.

59:07.339 --> 59:09.788
He turns on the light, gets undressed...

59:09.883 --> 59:13.649
turns off the light,
gets into bed, we blow up the bed.

59:15.055 --> 59:18.547
I knew a field agent who got
too scared to sleep in his bed.

59:18.642 --> 59:22.199
So every night he slept
on the floor of his closet.

59:22.813 --> 59:24.910
He still does, every night.

59:25.399 --> 59:26.847
Sleeps in closets.

59:26.942 --> 59:29.975
Now if al-Chir sleeps in his closet,
we're in trouble.

59:30.070 --> 59:33.919
But if he gets in the bed,
his weight arms the device...

59:34.199 --> 59:36.422
it closes the circuit.

59:36.993 --> 59:39.717
Then we hit the remote.

59:46.878 --> 59:48.350
Okay.

59:48.672 --> 59:50.769
Okay, we're good. We're good, let's go.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

01:00:01.017 --> 01:00:03.824
I've checked into the room next door.

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:07.786
- Why?
- There are balconies.

01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:09.681
When he gets into bed...

01:00:09.776 --> 01:00:13.000
I give the signal by
switching off the light.

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:16.628
And if the bomb's too powerful
and you're in the next room?

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.066
Well, that won't happen.

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:20.674
Right?

01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:22.342

01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:24.636
- Robert?
- Robert?

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:27.347
It won't. No.

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:29.433
Okay.

01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:32.311

01:00:34.217 --> 01:00:35.981

- No.

will take care of it.

You can't send the army.
We won't allow it.

You won't allow it?

Our source doesn't know we're Mossad.

You aren't Mossad.

01:10:09.459 --> 01:10:12.158

our source will cut us off.

Why don't you and I go for a
walk and talk about this, alone?

- We're good at this.

this is our job.

juvenile sort of way.

Eventually the Arab states
will rise against Israel.

01:31:36.328 --> 01:31:40.260
They don't like Palestinians,
but they hate the Jews more.

01:31:40.665 --> 01:31:42.822
It won't be like 1967.

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:46.743
The rest of the world will see by
then what the Israelis do to us.

01:31:46.838 --> 01:31:50.979
They won't help when Egypt
and Syria attack. Even Jordan.

01:31:51.384 --> 01:31:53.774
Israel will cease to exist.

01:31:57.265 --> 01:31:58.570
What?

01:31:59.392 --> 01:32:03.742
This is a dream. You can't take back
a country you never had.

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.637
- You sound like a Jew.
- Fuck you.

01:32:05.732 --> 01:32:08.765
I'm the voice inside your head
telling you what you already know.

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.416
You people have nothing to bargain with.

01:32:11.696 --> 01:32:13.270
You'll never get the land back.

01:32:13.365 --> 01:32:17.023
You'll all die old men in refugee
camps waiting for Palestine.

We have a lot of children.
They'll have children.

01:32:19.746 --> 01:32:21.194
So we can wait forever.

01:32:21.289 --> 01:32:24.864
And if we need to, we can make
the whole planet unsafe for Jews.

01:32:24.959 --> 01:32:27.075
You kill Jews and the world
feels bad for them...

01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:29.536
- and thinks you are animals.
- Yes.

01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:32.706
But then the world will see how
they've made us into animals.

01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:37.109
They'll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages.

01:32:37.806 --> 01:32:41.905
You are Arabs.
There are lots of places for Arabs.

01:32:43.311 --> 01:32:45.617
You're a Jew sympathizer.

01:32:46.481 --> 01:32:49.621
All you Germans,
you're too soft on Israel.

01:32:49.984 --> 01:32:53.393
Well, you give us money,
but you feel guilty about Hitler.

01:32:53.488 --> 01:32:56.128
And the Jews exploit that guilt.

01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:59.172
My father didn't gas any Jews.

01:33:02.789 --> 01:33:05.971
- Tell me something, Ali.
- What?

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.475
Do you really miss your
father's olive trees?

01:33:11.005 --> 01:33:15.439

to get back all that... that nothing?

want for your children?

It absolutely is.

It will take a hundred years,
but we'll win.

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:32.914
How long did it take the Jews
to get their own country?

01:33:33.236 --> 01:33:36.186
How long did it take the Germans
to make Germany?

01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:38.104

is not to have a home.

don't get it.

- Is he alone?

- How do we know if he's alone?
- Just flip the switch. Do it.

- I don't understand it.
- What's wrong?

01:37:12.789 --> 01:37:14.886

if I could build bombs instead.

- He's here for eye treatment.
- Salameh. You saw him?

- You followed him?
- Yes.

01:43:18.612 --> 01:43:20.770
- Wearing sunglasses in the rain.
- Why didn't you shoot him?

01:43:20.865 --> 01:43:22.271
There were bodyguards. Civilians.

01:43:22.366 --> 01:43:23.522
- Were they armed?
- Yes.

01:43:23.617 --> 01:43:26.025
Well then, they're not civilians.
I'd have done it...

01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.985
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.446
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

01:43:30.541 --> 01:43:32.239
Maybe that's why we never let you do it.

01:43:32.334 --> 01:43:34.533
- We only go after our targets.
- Since when?

we worried about that now?

It's counterproductive.

the laws of the state of Israel...

are dressed in expensive suits...

It's just we've brought our war
to Copenhagen and Kensington...

02:06:04.227 --> 02:06:06.217
One day I'm going to wake up,
I'm going to kill...

02:06:06.312 --> 02:06:09.619
I'm going to go back to bed,
I'm not going to feel anything at all.

02:06:11.401 --> 02:06:15.727
Hey, Hans? You know there's a rule
in the book against blind drunks.

02:06:15.822 --> 02:06:17.729
Why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

02:06:17.824 --> 02:06:21.423
I mean, there's enough food
here to feed Bangladesh.

02:06:24.122 --> 02:06:28.096
I keep seeing that Dutch woman,
you know, sprawled out like that.

02:06:31.254 --> 02:06:34.370
It's not that I wish
we hadn't killed her.

02:06:34.465 --> 02:06:37.564
I wish I had let you
close up her housecoat.

02:06:37.844 --> 02:06:41.693
Yeah, but you weren't yourself.

I went to Hans' flat above
the antique shop...

02:07:09.083 --> 02:07:12.348
just to check up on him
because he was so...

02:07:13.045 --> 02:07:15.870
Anyway, he's gone somewhere,
and I waited all night...

02:07:15.965 --> 02:07:17.896
and he's not come back.

It will be beautiful.

02:12:44.418 --> 02:12:48.184
LOUIS: Ali Hassan Salameh is
in Tarifa on the Spanish coast.

02:12:48.964 --> 02:12:52.873
He's at a compound guarded
by all the predictable trouble.

02:12:52.968 --> 02:12:56.025
Bomb makers often die accidental deaths.

02:12:58.098 --> 02:13:00.696
In Athens you shot a KGB agent.

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:06.119
Many people must want to kill you,
Monsieur Storsch.

02:13:06.232 --> 02:13:09.831
But why would I do that?
You pay better than anyone.

02:13:15.074 --> 02:13:17.880
It's dangerous going after Salameh.

02:13:18.869 --> 02:13:21.050
But he planned the Munich massacre.

02:13:24.875 --> 02:13:28.891
Eliminate him, and they'll let you
go home. Don't you think?

02:13:32.091 --> 02:13:34.063
Yes, Louis. I do.

02:13:37.763 --> 02:13:40.903
You could have a kitchen
like that someday.

02:13:43.727 --> 02:13:47.827
It costs dearly, but home always does.

Can you tell how many?

02:15:09.188 --> 02:15:10.868
That's him.

02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:17.583
Are you sure it's him, Avner?

02:15:18.948 --> 02:15:21.003
You have to be sure.

- Hop in.

I'm Amos. This is Avi. Shin Bet.

We're not supposed
to know who you are...

02:16:41.362 --> 02:16:42.561
because we're not officers.

02:16:42.656 --> 02:16:45.713
We're just shit
and no one tells us shit.

02:16:47.201 --> 02:16:50.134
We've heard about what you've done.

02:16:51.832 --> 02:16:54.388
We want to say it's an honor
to meet you.

02:16:59.298 --> 02:17:01.687
It's an honor for me, too.

02:17:10.808 --> 02:17:13.133
I have no problems with
anything you guys did...

02:17:13.227 --> 02:17:16.369
except the woman
on the houseboat in Hoorn.

02:17:16.690 --> 02:17:18.388
Steve's told us about her.

02:17:18.484 --> 02:17:19.682
We took a leave of absence...

02:17:19.777 --> 02:17:21.058
and killed her off the company clock.

02:17:21.153 --> 02:17:22.226
Don't be an idiot.

02:17:22.321 --> 02:17:25.669
Otherwise, as I said, we have no
problems with the job you did.

02:17:26.325 --> 02:17:28.398
Except three of my men died.

02:17:28.494 --> 02:17:29.566
According to your colleague...

02:17:29.661 --> 02:17:31.777
I should say, emphatically,
according to your colleague...

02:17:31.871 --> 02:17:33.404
not in any way your fault.

02:17:33.499 --> 02:17:34.655

He says this French group...
Louis was his name?

They sold the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

02:17:47.763 --> 02:17:49.777
They helped kill your men.

02:17:50.766 --> 02:17:53.007
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

They won't work with you.

- It's about loyalty.
- You're an Israeli officer.

That's your only loyalty! That's it!

Listen, the Prime Minister is
proud of you and your men.

She wishes she could tell you herself,
but she can't.

Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

- Yes.

Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

02:19:22.107 --> 02:19:25.414
Tell me the names and
numbers of your sources.

and I might.

You can't. I don't work for you.

I don't exist.

02:19:41.543 --> 02:19:44.767
- You look terrible.
- I'm not good right now.

You don't need to tell me anything.
It's taken a lot from you.

- I'm alive, right?
- And the rest sorts itself out.

I'm not a fool, Avner.
I never said you were a fool.

02:20:20.499 --> 02:20:22.948
I never talked to you about it.

02:20:23.043 --> 02:20:26.308
- I knew.
- You knew? So what was there to say?

02:20:27.464 --> 02:20:30.080
I didn't die, because I came here.

02:20:30.175 --> 02:20:33.584
When I arrived, I walked up to
the top of a hill in Jerusalem...

02:20:33.679 --> 02:20:36.795
and prayed for a child.

02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:39.882
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

02:20:39.977 --> 02:20:43.534
And I could feel every one
of them praying with me.

02:20:46.775 --> 02:20:49.164

What you did, you did for us.

02:20:52.656 --> 02:20:55.772
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

02:20:55.867 --> 02:20:59.383
Every one of the ones who died,
died wanting this.

02:21:00.706 --> 02:21:04.406
We had to take it,
because no one will ever give it to us.

02:21:04.501 --> 02:21:08.017
A place to be a Jew among Jews,
subject to no one.

02:21:09.881 --> 02:21:12.605
I thank God for hearing my prayer.

Do you want me to tell you what I did?

02:21:22.602 --> 02:21:23.949
No.

We have a place on Earth.

02:21:36.867 --> 02:21:38.422
At last.

02:21:48.003 --> 02:21:50.392
- What's this?
- Baklava.

02:21:50.964 --> 02:21:54.164
From Rehovot? The only edible
baklava is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

02:21:54.259 --> 02:21:56.458
Eat it on the plane. You're too thin.

02:21:56.553 --> 02:21:58.901
I hope it gives you a bellyache.

Listen, forget it.

02:22:01.433 --> 02:22:04.132
You go see your wife, your child,
rest for a few more months.

02:22:04.227 --> 02:22:05.926
Then we're gonna
put you back in the field.

02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:07.761
Not Europe. Probably Latin America.

02:22:07.856 --> 02:22:11.372
You think it over. Rest, Avner.
Then you come back.

Real cheese.
The kind you can't find in America.

- Do I know you, sir?

Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt my father.

that everyone we killed...

02:33:31.247 --> 02:33:32.737
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

02:33:32.832 --> 02:33:34.864
And Zwaiter,
your harmless little writer in Rome?

02:33:34.959 --> 02:33:38.242
He was behind the bomb on
El Al flight 76 in 1968.

02:33:38.337 --> 02:33:40.119
He was working on
another bomb last August.

02:33:40.214 --> 02:33:41.287
I could go on and on with this.

02:33:41.382 --> 02:33:43.915
According to evidence nobody has seen.

02:33:44.010 --> 02:33:46.834
If these people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

02:33:46.929 --> 02:33:48.735
Like Eichmann.

02:33:48.931 --> 02:33:50.755
If these guys live, Israelis die.

02:33:50.850 --> 02:33:55.116
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

02:34:04.447 --> 02:34:06.688
You did well, but you're unhappy.

02:34:06.783 --> 02:34:09.464
- I killed seven men.
- Not Salameh.

02:34:09.994 --> 02:34:11.758
We'll get him, of course.

02:34:14.707 --> 02:34:16.971
You think you were the only team?

02:34:17.335 --> 02:34:20.326
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

02:34:20.421 --> 02:34:22.519
Does that assuage your guilt?

02:34:23.466 --> 02:34:25.647
Did we accomplish anything at all?

02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:28.501
Every man we killed has
been replaced by worse.

02:34:28.596 --> 02:34:31.587
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

02:34:31.682 --> 02:34:34.090
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

02:34:34.185 --> 02:34:35.550
or the Palestinian leadership?

02:34:35.645 --> 02:34:37.301
You tell me what we've done.

02:34:37.396 --> 02:34:39.095
You killed them for the
sake of a country...

02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:40.745
you now choose to abandon.

02:34:41.943 --> 02:34:45.810
The country your mother and father built,
that you were born into.

02:34:45.905 --> 02:34:48.920
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

02:34:50.451 --> 02:34:53.568
There's no peace at the end of this,
no matter what you believe.

02:34:53.663 --> 02:34:56.946
- You know this is true.
- Here's what I know.

02:34:57.041 --> 02:34:59.032
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

02:34:59.127 --> 02:35:02.642
You're a sabra.
Your wife and daughter are sabras.

02:35:03.256 --> 02:35:05.770
What I came to say is this...

02:35:06.676 --> 02:35:08.314
come home.

02:35:22.316 --> 02:35:24.581
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

02:35:26.112 --> 02:35:28.144
Come on.
You're a Jew, you're a stranger.

02:35:28.239 --> 02:35:30.813
It's written someplace or
other that I'm meant to...

02:35:30.908 --> 02:35:33.923
ask you to come and break bread with me.

02:35:34.203 --> 02:35:39.053
So break bread with me, Ephraim.

02:35:42.753 --> 02:35:44.100
No.
