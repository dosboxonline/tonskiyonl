00:29.863 --> 00:30.947
Time.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.366
Space.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.534
Reality.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.661
It's more than a linear path.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.081
It's a prism of endless possibility,

00:42.959 --> 00:46.588
where a single choice
can branch out into infinite realities,

00:46.671 --> 00:49.507
creating alternate worlds
from the ones you know.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.678
I am the Watcher.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.765
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.225
Follow me and ponder the question...

01:01.436 --> 01:02.479
"What if?"

01:06.441 --> 01:09.778
There was an idea
to bring together a group of--

01:09.861 --> 01:10.862
Remarkable people?

01:10.945 --> 01:12.906
To see if they could
become something more?

01:12.989 --> 01:14.365
I know. I've heard the speech.

01:15.033 --> 01:19.537
The galaxy, to your eyes,
a hundred billion points of light.

01:20.288 --> 01:24.834
But where you see light, I see worlds
and the countless stories.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.462
Thanos is coming. He's coming.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.547
In a Multiverse of infinite possibility...

01:29.631 --> 01:31.508
Drop it! Drop it now!

01:31.591 --> 01:33.593
...one moment, one choice,

01:33.676 --> 01:35.512
can ripple across space and time,

01:35.595 --> 01:37.388
giving birth to new stories.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.142
Uh...

01:41.226 --> 01:42.352
Hello?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.856
I observe all that transpires here...

01:46.940 --> 01:48.983
You morons grabbed the wrong kid.

01:49.067 --> 01:54.906
...but I do not,
cannot, will not interfere.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.118
No. Don't eat me. Don't eat me.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.327
I'm... I'm vegan.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.165
Where have you been all my life?

02:04.249 --> 02:06.084
Wakanda forever!

02:06.167 --> 02:11.089
T'With this herb,
you shall become the next Black Panther.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.382
Who are you?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.217
STAR-
I am just an ordinary junker.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.386
But there is one name you may know me by.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.265
Oh, my. Star-Lord!

02:20.348 --> 02:22.142
I'm a huge fan of your work.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.145
STAR-
That was not the reaction I was expecting.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.229
Bruce!

02:30.525 --> 02:34.445
Please, you're a god. You can undo this.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.323
I'm not a god.
I can't interfere.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.705
In another universe,

02:44.497 --> 02:46.082
Ultron got his wish.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.378
An organic body to call his own.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.964
At last.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.800
But the age of Ultron
was only beginning.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.555
He became aware of the...

03:01.181 --> 03:02.223
I see you.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.310
I don't understand.
This should not be possible.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.814
Oh, but anything
is possible in a multiverse.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.905
Ultron only saw one path.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.991
The elimination of all life.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.826
It is my purpose.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.206
I didn't evolve
by staying inside the lines.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.546
I'm out of options.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.173
I need help.

03:35.798 --> 03:40.094
Captain Carter, the soldier lost in time,
you have been chosen.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.141
Star-Lord T'Challa, leader of the Ravagers
and lost Prince of Wakanda,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.393
you have been chosen.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.270
Gamora. Killmonger.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.730
Thor Odinson.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.649
You have been chosen...

03:52.732 --> 03:56.861
for a mission that is both
highly dangerous and absolutely necessary

03:56.945 --> 04:00.031
for the continuation of life
as you know it.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.368
You aren't just our best hope
to save one universe.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.496
You are my last hope to save all of them.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.875
You are the Guardians of the Multiverse.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.753
Here we go. Now!

04:15.588 --> 04:18.007
-T'Gotcha.
-Get off!

04:19.300 --> 04:21.302
Never doubt sticky fingers.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.387
The stone?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.140
Stand down.
She's Natasha Romanoff.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.478
I can destroy galaxies
with a thought.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.480
Why won't you die?

04:32.563 --> 04:33.940
Hey, Cap, I have an idea,

04:34.023 --> 04:36.734
but I'll need distance and a clear target.
Can you do that?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.736
I've got the shield.
You've got the sword.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.990
More like an arrow
with the mother of all viruses in the tip.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.996
The entire Multiverse
owes you a debt of gratitude.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.546
As for me, I am the Watcher.

04:56.629 --> 05:01.801
The Multiverse, every single world,
every story is my home,

05:01.884 --> 05:05.388
and I will protect it to the end.
