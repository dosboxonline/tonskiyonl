WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.503
<i>Coexistence is messy.</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:06.047
<i>Thus, my love for education,</i>

00:06.548 --> 00:08.008
<i>for my X-Men.</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:11.511
<i>Their heroism teaches a lesson
we mustn't forget.</i>

00:12.387 --> 00:14.973
<i>That the universe is very old,</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:17.892
<i>and all of us, very young.</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:20.395
<i>Born of ancient stardust,</i>

00:20.895 --> 00:23.356
<i>and all children of the atom.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.913
<i>When Disney+ first
came about, I had a great opportunity</i>

00:38.913 --> 00:41.166
to go into Kevin's office

00:41.166 --> 00:46.421
and pitch every wild animated idea
I could think of.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.382
And the first words out of my mouth were,

00:49.382 --> 00:52.177
"Revival of the original
<i>X-Men: The Animated Series."</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:58.808
<i>It was, by far, the most influential show
on me as a kid.</i>

00:58.808 --> 01:02.145
<i>It holds
such a special place in everyone's heart.</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:06.983
It has made animation fans
of so many people, myself included.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
<i>I remember when
Pizza Hut was doing the promo</i>

01:09.694 --> 01:12.238
for "Night of the Sentinels I and II"
on VHS.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.406
I wore that thing out.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.033
<i>That was my introduction to the show,</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.535
<i>and that's where my love
of the characters came from.</i>

01:17.535 --> 01:21.748
It was groundbreaking, and I loved
looking forward to watching it.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.918
<i>X-Men,</i> more than anything,
is my favorite allegory.

01:24.918 --> 01:29.255
The X-Men have always treated
being different in a realistic way,

01:29.255 --> 01:31.841
<i>like how would the world
actually react to that?</i>

01:32.634 --> 01:34.469
<i>The X-Men feel grounded,</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:38.264
they're ground level,
they deal with being persecuted,

01:38.264 --> 01:40.683
trying to go out
and help people that hate you.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.310
It weighs on you a lot,

01:42.310 --> 01:45.438
<i>and we get a chance
to be in those moments with them,</i>

01:45.980 --> 01:48.108
<i>and how that affects their relationships,</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:50.860
<i>I think it's all great allegory
for our world now.</i>

01:51.361 --> 01:53.321
<i>It was a show
that was for kids,</i>

01:53.321 --> 01:55.532
<i>but it didn't talk down to the audience.</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:58.118
I think this is a strength
of the comic book,

01:58.118 --> 01:59.744
as well as the animated series,

01:59.744 --> 02:02.038
<i>and you can go all the way back
to the earliest comics</i>

02:02.038 --> 02:03.331
<i>written by Stan Lee,</i>

02:03.331 --> 02:08.461
<i>to see that the X-Men
made people's feelings of isolation,</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:12.298
of trauma in their own lives, feel seen,
and it certainly made me feel seen.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.467
I thought you wanted to be cured.

02:14.467 --> 02:18.680
That's what I thought, too, Doc,
but there ain't no cure for who you are.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.141
<i>I loved being able
to see these characters</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:25.937
who really, in one way or another,
saved us as kids.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.690
Whether they became our friends
because we were lonely kids,

02:28.690 --> 02:31.067
or they taught us,
or they were just the fun heroes

02:31.067 --> 02:32.777
that we got to check in on on Saturday.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.864
Okay, hairball, let's talk.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.450
What I really respected about <i>X-Men</i>
was that it said,

02:39.450 --> 02:43.288
<i>"Life is hard, and it's gonna be hard,
but you can do it together,</i>

02:43.288 --> 02:45.290
<i>"you can have a team,
you can find your family,</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:47.458
"and you can actually make a difference."

02:47.458 --> 02:49.419
So often in our history,

02:49.419 --> 02:53.756
unhappy, misguided people
have created scapegoats,

02:53.756 --> 02:57.427
blaming those that are different
for the problems in their own lives.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.763
It is an evil in men's hearts
that must be fought.

03:02.599 --> 03:06.561
The original pitch
was about reviving the series,

03:06.561 --> 03:09.105
not about rebooting it,
not about remaking it.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.024
<i>A lot of people will say,</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:12.567
<i>"It's</i> X-Men: The Animated Series.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.361
<i>"They're continuing on
with one of my favorite shows,</i>

03:15.361 --> 03:18.656
"the show that I grew up on,
the show that I'm introducing my kids to.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.992
"What are they gonna do with it?
Where will they go?"

03:20.992 --> 03:23.036
And we're those same people.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.206
<i>Like, everyone making this show
is that fan going,</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:27.332
<i>"Where do we want to go?</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:29.167
<i>"If the series had never stopped,</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:33.171
<i>"if it had continued on,
what other stories would the show tell?"</i>

03:33.171 --> 03:35.632
I know you cannot bear to see him go,

03:36.257 --> 03:38.468
but it is the only way.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.928
Can he ever come back?

03:39.928 --> 03:43.056
From the jump,
it's like that direct continuation,

03:43.056 --> 03:46.392
<i>that direct lining up with the stories
that they were telling in the '90s,</i>

03:46.392 --> 03:50.521
<i>and seeing where that can take us,
referencing the comic's lore since then,</i>

03:50.521 --> 03:54.359
<i>but really tapping into
this nostalgia factor of that series.</i>

03:54.359 --> 03:55.568
Heads up!

03:57.779 --> 04:00.490
<i>So much of
the conversation was about</i>

04:00.490 --> 04:02.784
<i>not just paying homage
to the original style,</i>

04:03.284 --> 04:06.579
but emulating people's memories
of the original style.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.165
Oh, my stars and garters.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.291
We must warn the team.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.378
<i>And so,
we have Larry Houston, the director,</i>

04:13.378 --> 04:15.713
<i>who's coming back
as a consulting producer for us,</i>

04:15.713 --> 04:19.759
as well as the Lewalds, who were
the original showrunners on the series.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.929
<i>Disney+ began to run</i>
X-Men: The Animated Series,

04:22.929 --> 04:24.514
I want to say in 2019,

04:24.514 --> 04:28.393
<i>and we were amazed
at the fan response to that,</i>

04:28.393 --> 04:31.312
but we had not heard that something
was going to happen

04:31.312 --> 04:33.481
until it really started happening.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.150
Yeah, they were playing everything
close to the vest,

04:36.150 --> 04:38.152
and then we got the phone call
and they said,

04:38.152 --> 04:39.696
<i>"Well, it's happening.</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:43.741
<i>"We've got a huge staff of excited young,
you know, creative people.</i>

04:43.741 --> 04:47.578
<i>"Do you two and your friend Larry Houston
want to be involved as consultants?"</i>

04:47.578 --> 04:50.540
I could not believe
that I was hearing what I was hearing,

04:50.540 --> 04:53.334
you know, that truly,
calling it <i>X-Men '97,</i>

04:53.334 --> 04:56.296
because they're picking up
where the original series wrapped,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.464
<i>amazing and exciting.</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:01.843
Trask would rather humans and mutants
go to war than work together.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.387
We all win when men like him fail.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.638
You sound like Charles.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.807
He would have been proud today.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.603
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
But to be honest, it was a team effort.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.899
I remember when we first called them

05:16.899 --> 05:18.901
to let them know
that we were doing the series,

05:18.901 --> 05:23.239
they told us a story about
having to make the same call to Stan Lee

05:23.239 --> 05:25.033
when they did the original series.

05:25.575 --> 05:30.330
<i>And just like Stan told them,
they told us that they have our back</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:31.706
and to make them proud.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.043
I know I've been hard-headed lately,
it's just...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.795
I didn't know how the X-Men
could go on without the Professor.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.464
Thought it was on me.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.967
But his dream doesn't need me.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.635
It has all of you.

05:46.637 --> 05:52.643
My superhero world started with mythology,
Greek mythology, Egyptology.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.355
The literature I read,
basically all fantasy.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.316
Then I discovered comics.
I cannot remember exactly when,

05:58.316 --> 06:01.778
<i>but my first comic was</i> Iron Man,

06:03.321 --> 06:06.908
<i>and then I got</i> X-Men,
Spider-Man, <i>all of them.</i>

06:06.908 --> 06:10.745
I started reading them like crazy,
and as an only child,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.248
I was the ultimate mutant.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.960
I went to school
in Hofstra in Long Island,

06:17.960 --> 06:19.420
and I became...

06:20.671 --> 06:22.215
a very successful toy inventor.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.634
And the first toy

06:25.718 --> 06:28.679
that I wanted to turn into a show
was <i>X-Men,</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:29.806
and I felt...

06:30.723 --> 06:32.558
if I take something that exciting,

06:32.558 --> 06:35.228
kids wouldn't feel
that they're the only one like them.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.729
<i>So I'm pitching</i> X-Men,

06:36.729 --> 06:39.482
<i>and Stan Lee is with me
in many of these meetings,</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:40.942
and no one got it.

06:40.942 --> 06:45.696
<i>They tried all during the '80s
to get</i> X-Men <i>on television,</i>

06:45.696 --> 06:49.158
and nobody in Hollywood
thought it would be successful.

06:49.158 --> 06:53.996
"Oh, superheroes, you can't make
a successful TV show around them."

06:54.497 --> 06:56.916
So it was this non-starter.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.044
Sounds like just another day
that ends in "y" when you put it that way.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.673
Precisely. And we face it
as we always have.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.258
As a family.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.389
When we were at Marvel Productions
in the mid-'80s,

07:11.389 --> 07:13.391
I had two supervisors.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.561
One was Stan Lee,
the other one was Margaret Loesch.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.064
<i>Margaret Loesch always believed
in the concept of</i> The X-Men.

07:20.648 --> 07:25.903
<i>So fast forward about six years,
she became the CEO of Fox Kids Network.</i>

07:26.404 --> 07:28.322
She had the power to greenlit stuff now.

07:28.322 --> 07:32.952
So she called up me, Will Meugniot,
Eric, Julia, and some others,

07:32.952 --> 07:36.497
said, "Okay, we're gonna do <i>The X-Men.</i>
Gonna put it on the air."

07:36.998 --> 07:39.417
And she's like
the secret superhero nobody knows about.

07:39.417 --> 07:43.045
Do you hear that applause?
They love you, guys.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.591
Stick with me and you, X-Men,
will be stars.

07:46.591 --> 07:50.553
The folks above her didn't believe
<i>X-Men</i> was gonna do anything.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
And it was, "Okay, we'll give you
13 episodes, but that's it.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.641
"And if this fails, you're out of a job."

07:55.641 --> 07:57.435
She goes, "Okay, I'll take that risk."

07:57.935 --> 08:00.730
You were hired to do 13 episodes,
one season,

08:00.730 --> 08:02.648
and I got to be a writer on that season.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.151
But after 13 episodes,
we were all let go.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.488
The entire creative staff
was let go in July, August,

08:08.488 --> 08:09.864
when we'd finished our work.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.159
And then in January, it premiered,
and suddenly it was this number one hit.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.161
If ratings don't go up with every show,

08:15.161 --> 08:19.916
I'll cancel the series
and its performers permanently.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.417
Control room!

08:22.001 --> 08:25.087
It's showtime!

08:25.588 --> 08:28.090
So we were working in other places,
and we had the call saying,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.927
"Um... We really want you to come back
for another season."

08:30.927 --> 08:33.054
And about half of us could.
Some of them couldn't.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.014
They came back as quick as they could.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.226
The ratings are going through the roof!

08:38.226 --> 08:41.604
<i>At the time, we were not aware
of how popular the show was.</i>

08:41.604 --> 08:43.856
<i>There was no Internet, you know,
none of that stuff.</i>

08:43.856 --> 08:45.858
<i>We just had ratings. That's all we had.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:50.279
And so, the first season was actually
the most important season for us,

08:50.780 --> 08:55.034
<i>because we had to get the highest ratings
to keep the show on the air.</i>

08:55.576 --> 08:57.578
<i>And so, we were lucky
to get that second season.</i>

08:57.578 --> 08:59.622
<i>But, you know,
we were hanging on like a cat,</i>

08:59.622 --> 09:01.332
you know that picture
with the cat hanging on,

09:01.332 --> 09:02.917
we were like that because we had no idea.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.003
<i>We were not aware
of what's going on out in the world</i>

09:06.003 --> 09:08.756
<i>with folks watching this
and falling in love with it,</i>

09:08.756 --> 09:13.594
until Julia asked a friend of ours there,
Charlotte Fullerton, about,

09:13.594 --> 09:17.014
"Do you get any fan mail on this show?
Is it doing okay?"

09:17.014 --> 09:18.599
I happened to show up at Fox Studios

09:18.599 --> 09:21.435
and asked her,
you know, "What's the feedback?"

09:21.435 --> 09:24.230
Because, again, the ratings
we knew were amazing,

09:24.230 --> 09:25.982
but, "Are you getting any response?"

09:25.982 --> 09:27.483
And she took me into a hallway,

09:27.483 --> 09:33.281
and those big, milky USPS mail cartons
that you see mailmen carry,

09:33.781 --> 09:35.616
there was one on the ground,
and it was full,

09:35.616 --> 09:37.076
and it was stacked and it was full.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.787
- With fan mail.
- Stacked all down the hall and back.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.871
Floor to ceiling, stacked.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.541
And she goes, "Every one of those,
it's the kid for <i>X-Men."</i>

09:43.541 --> 09:46.210
<i>Parents loved it.
Parents sent thank-yous.</i>

09:46.210 --> 09:48.212
<i>"My child's life changed.</i>

09:48.212 --> 09:50.089
"He realized he's not alone.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.882
"There are others like him."

09:51.882 --> 09:53.801
And I used to go talk to...

09:54.427 --> 09:57.513
For promotional purposes,
I said, "We are all like that."

09:57.513 --> 10:01.475
And I think the best evidence of it
was <i>X-Men.</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:12.737
Back in the '90s, it's either <i>Scooby-Doo</i>
or <i>Super Friends,</i> that was the standard.

10:12.737 --> 10:16.324
<i>So, we wanted to make sure that when kids
saw "Night of the Sentinels I and II,"</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:19.035
<i>they could tell this is not the usual
show that they're used to.</i>

10:19.035 --> 10:21.287
<i>This is different.
This is going to stand out.</i>

10:21.287 --> 10:22.747
Did you see what she did?

10:23.247 --> 10:25.583
Yes, Rogue has a way with men.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.585
What we were doing is like,

10:27.585 --> 10:30.212
"You're going to kill a character off
in the first episode.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.256
<i>"You got a girl being chased by a robot."</i>

10:32.256 --> 10:35.509
<i>Stand aside. I must apprehend that mutant.</i>

10:35.509 --> 10:38.179
We did that deliberately
so that people would,

10:38.179 --> 10:40.389
"Wow, what's this?
What's going to happen next?"

10:40.389 --> 10:45.353
<i>We wanted to pull them into the show
and make it a must-see show every week.</i>

10:45.353 --> 10:47.772
Life don't get much better than this.

10:47.772 --> 10:52.777
<i>We all knew that there's something
in our stories that is like a mission,</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:58.157
and you feel it, so that you just
cannot wait to get to the next chapter.

10:58.157 --> 11:03.245
I still remember rushing home
after school to watch each new episode,

11:03.245 --> 11:08.042
and I think it was the first serialized
piece of entertainment I had ever watched.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.837
<i>It was the first time I remember
there being, like, cliffhangers</i>

11:11.837 --> 11:13.464
<i>at the end of every episode,</i>

11:13.464 --> 11:17.510
<i>and that amazing feeling you had
when anything was a "to be continued"</i>

11:17.510 --> 11:19.929
<i>happened every single day on that show.</i>

11:20.721 --> 11:22.306
<i>It was my gateway into comics.</i>

11:22.306 --> 11:24.100
I'd watch that original series

11:24.100 --> 11:26.227
and then immediately want to go
to the comic store

11:26.227 --> 11:28.646
and see what was going on,
not just with <i>X-Men,</i>

11:28.646 --> 11:30.940
<i>but every comic book on the shelf.</i>

11:30.940 --> 11:33.359
<i>And as I became a filmmaker</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:35.736
and started meeting
with writers and directors,

11:35.736 --> 11:40.449
so often you would hear that show come up
as a seminal work in their lives,

11:40.449 --> 11:45.246
<i>and you could see that the love of comics
for people that grew up in the '90s</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:48.416
was in large part
due to that series in particular.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.669
We have accomplished
a great victory this day.

11:54.463 --> 11:59.009
I think the '90s aesthetic
is something that is so intrinsically tied

11:59.009 --> 12:02.555
to those designs that they used,
but also how that show feels.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.098
<i>It just feels of that era.</i>

12:04.098 --> 12:06.559
<i>We're looking to do
the same things that they were.</i>

12:06.559 --> 12:08.352
Yo, Cyclops. Hit me.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.023
<i>Using the proportions
of those really muscular,</i>

12:13.023 --> 12:17.945
<i>you know, iconic characters, not diverging
from the really comic-accurate look.</i>

12:17.945 --> 12:20.197
<i>You know, the Jim Lee stuff
was their North Star</i>

12:20.197 --> 12:22.032
<i>in designing that series,</i>

12:22.032 --> 12:25.453
and I think we're trying to use that
as our North Star as well.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.039
<i>The comics designs
obviously had much more detail</i>

12:29.039 --> 12:31.333
<i>and much more evocative line work.</i>

12:31.333 --> 12:33.210
It's the tangibility of the world.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.255
I mean, it felt like comic pages
were moving.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.925
<i>The high contrast, black shadows,
I mean, they went for it.</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:41.469
<i>It just gave it more life.</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:43.471
They didn't streamline any of the designs.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.431
<i>Like, look at Storm's hair.</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:46.599
You know, it's crazy.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.101
There's many little wisps,
but they're tracking all that,

12:49.101 --> 12:50.603
<i>and that's what made it so unique.</i>

12:50.603 --> 12:52.104
I love that aesthetic.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.982
<i>It fills me with
an immense sense of nostalgia,</i>

12:54.982 --> 12:57.401
<i>and it feels like a celebration to me.</i>

12:57.401 --> 12:59.487
What a kick! Can we do it again?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.451
<i>Animation has
just come leaps and bounds,</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:08.662
<i>not only with the technology,
but also with the styles.</i>

13:08.662 --> 13:12.625
Not just animation style,
whether it's 2D or CG,

13:12.625 --> 13:16.337
but also in how animation
is approached with directing.

13:16.337 --> 13:21.217
Emi and Chase are the episodic directors,
which means they did every other episode.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.762
<i>Jake set up the directing style
with the first episode,</i>

13:24.762 --> 13:26.180
<i>and then they followed suit.</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:28.766
<i>For me, it was a discussion
of, where do we go tonally?</i>

13:28.766 --> 13:31.352
Because there are things
in the original series

13:31.352 --> 13:33.979
that you might see as cheesy,
but actually aren't.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.064
Maybe that was a budget.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.400
I mean, you watch it now, and you can see
recycled animation, and you can tell,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.237
"They just didn't have the means
to go back in with retakes."

13:41.237 --> 13:43.531
And we've actually spoken with Larry
about that since.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.326
You know, I only had so much time,
so it was like, I had to get it done.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.580
<i>Now that we have that ability,
and we can put that budget behind it,</i>

13:51.580 --> 13:55.000
how do we then go,
"Okay, so then what is this show?"

13:55.000 --> 13:58.087
<i>Because is it just the visuals?
Is it just the storytelling?</i>

13:58.587 --> 14:01.215
And I think what we all
ended up deciding on,

14:01.215 --> 14:05.094
I just want the audience to feel
the same way we felt watching it as kids.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.763
Rogue always come to Gambit's rescue.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.890
I've always wanted to make content

14:09.890 --> 14:12.977
that was as potent
as the stuff that inspired me,

14:12.977 --> 14:16.480
<i>because we all stand on the shoulders
of the people prior to us, right?</i>

14:16.480 --> 14:20.860
Never thought to ask the Professor
to show me how he did what he did so well.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.695
Some lessons are taught, Scott.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.738
Others are learned.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.365
<i>We're all huge</i> X-Men <i>fans,</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:28.993
<i>and we wanted to see them elevated.</i>

14:28.993 --> 14:30.536
<i>And it forces us to be creative.</i>

14:31.036 --> 14:35.499
<i>It forces us to figure out, "Okay,
what's the clearest way to say this?"</i>

14:35.499 --> 14:38.961
What's the most impactful thing
that we can do here,

14:38.961 --> 14:41.088
<i>especially when it comes to action?</i>

14:41.088 --> 14:44.049
<i>Because we would like to embellish
on all of that stuff.</i>

14:44.049 --> 14:48.596
<i>How can we make every little piece
of action on screen as potent as possible?</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:50.389
<i>Animation is being
pushed so much.</i>

14:50.389 --> 14:51.849
<i>The bar is being raised so high.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:55.185
So how do we still stay relevant
and stay on that bar,

14:55.185 --> 14:57.271
but keep that nostalgic feel?

14:57.271 --> 14:59.481
Man, talk about simpler times.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.566
It's unreal.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.776
We should probably find a way out of here.

15:02.776 --> 15:03.986
What's the rush?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.071
These levels are taking me back.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.533
<i>We're set in '97.
We are essentially a period piece.</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:12.536
What was being done in cinema
between '96 and '98?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.496
How was live action being shot?

15:14.496 --> 15:15.873
How were things being animated?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.291
<i>What was TV animation doing?</i>

15:17.791 --> 15:19.335
<i>What lenses were being used?</i>

15:19.335 --> 15:21.170
<i>What was considered cinematic at the time?</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:23.380
<i>What was considered groundbreaking
at the time?</i>

15:23.380 --> 15:26.008
It's great to have those '90s tropes
in our back pocket,

15:26.008 --> 15:31.096
<i>because that is just a fundamental,
tactile feel in the DNA of the OG show.</i>

15:31.096 --> 15:35.017
While the idea of cell-drawn animation
with flat backgrounds

15:35.017 --> 15:37.770
kept you to a very flat frame,

15:37.770 --> 15:41.315
we are honoring that
almost 80% of the time.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.486
<i>But one thing that makes it</i> X-Men '97
<i>and not</i> X-Men: The Animated Series

15:45.486 --> 15:49.990
<i>is that we are blowing past that at times
for emotional effect.</i>

15:49.990 --> 15:54.954
<i>So big crescendo moments
in battles and in fight scenes,</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:57.039
<i>and even in some
of our bigger emotional scenes,</i>

15:57.039 --> 16:01.126
<i>push past that flat plane
into a more three-dimensional space.</i>

16:01.126 --> 16:04.463
<i>And that's something
that our studio partner, Studio Mir,</i>

16:04.463 --> 16:07.424
<i>who produce a lot of anime,
really allows us to do effectively.</i>

16:07.424 --> 16:10.886
What was done at the time
was the top of that animation scale,

16:10.886 --> 16:13.555
<i>was the top of the action
and what was available</i>

16:13.555 --> 16:15.182
<i>and what could be done at the time.</i>

16:15.182 --> 16:18.560
<i>And our responsibility now
is to do the same, to do the top.</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:20.354
<i>Like, that's how high the bar is.</i>

16:20.354 --> 16:23.649
<i>We were able to look at
the footage in this thing called DI.</i>

16:23.649 --> 16:27.319
It's a really cool post process
where we get to throw a filter on it.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.740
<i>We were thinking about a film filter
to make it look closer to '90s film.</i>

16:31.740 --> 16:33.784
<i>So you get a little bit of that jitter</i>

16:33.784 --> 16:36.036
<i>that you would have
from the film processing.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:41.041
<i>You get noise grain, film processing
makes the blacks pop out even harder.</i>

16:41.041 --> 16:43.085
I'm cool with rack focusing a bit more

16:43.085 --> 16:46.422
just to go a little more cinematic,
lean into the era of it all.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.299
And we also have to put it
to widescreen format, right?

16:49.299 --> 16:51.719
So we got to make it more cinematic.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.095
Look-y ahead.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.681
Ki-yay!

16:55.681 --> 16:59.351
They be busy doing a bit of renovating
since Gambit's last visit.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.187
<i>We wanted to make sure
we were honoring the Lewalds and Larry,</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:05.274
<i>and the work that they had set down,
that it was never going to be about,</i>

17:05.274 --> 17:07.860
"Well, that was cheesy,
so how cheesy can we go?"

17:07.860 --> 17:12.448
More like, "No, you guys were actually
building something incredibly beautiful.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.868
"Look at how much it affected
a whole generation of people."

17:15.868 --> 17:18.871
And to carry that torch
is not only a lot of responsibility,

17:18.871 --> 17:20.497
but we're actually excited for that.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.875
I can't wait. I want to bring honor
to these characters.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.586
Well, if being an X-Man
teaches anything, Ms. Tilby,

17:25.586 --> 17:27.713
it's to expect the unexpected.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.054
One of the most important aspects
to the series is the music.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.060
When you hear that rendition
of the opening title,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.855
what's amazing is not that it sounds new,

17:45.981 --> 17:49.193
<i>but that it sounds
like it really celebrates</i>

17:49.193 --> 17:52.780
<i>and props up what was beautiful
about that original music.</i>

17:53.447 --> 17:56.575
In terms of ID'ing a show,
I mean, it's so important.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.369
I mean, I grew up in the '60s
and there's a lot of shows

17:59.369 --> 18:01.455
that all you had to do
is hear two or three notes

18:01.455 --> 18:02.539
and you know what it is.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.541
And so we knew that for <i>The X-Men,</i>

18:04.541 --> 18:08.128
we need to have something that was
very distinctive and strong and driving.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.092
<i>Back in the '90s, I was given like,
I think, what, a weekend,</i>

18:13.092 --> 18:15.719
<i>like two or three days to draw the intro.</i>

18:15.719 --> 18:17.638
<i>And the intro is going
to be about a minute,</i>

18:17.638 --> 18:19.389
a minute and four seconds.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.641
I drew two minutes.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.726
<i>I just let the fanboy roll out of my head.</i>

18:22.726 --> 18:25.938
<i>I just started drawing images
and just let stuff pour out.</i>

18:25.938 --> 18:27.689
<i>And once I got it done and finished,</i>

18:27.689 --> 18:29.858
then we went back
and just took the two minutes

18:29.858 --> 18:33.946
and culled it down to just one minute,
the one what everybody knows right now.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.991
<i>My storyboard was actually done
before the music.</i>

18:38.575 --> 18:42.079
<i>And so, once we got that done,
the next part was trying to get the music</i>

18:42.621 --> 18:45.082
<i>that was driving
to try and match the high pace.</i>

18:45.082 --> 18:46.708
<i>And if my memory serves me right,</i>

18:46.708 --> 18:49.962
<i>I think it was, like, maybe
the 13th version of the music</i>

18:49.962 --> 18:51.421
<i>until we said, "Yeah, that's it."</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:54.550
Because the first 12 was like, no.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.010
<i>It didn't have the punch.
It didn't have the excitement.</i>

18:57.010 --> 19:00.222
And so, it took time
and then it magically merged together

19:00.222 --> 19:01.849
and everything worked out just fine.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.780
<i>The OG show
leaned into the prejudice.</i>

19:16.780 --> 19:19.283
It didn't shy away from it,
but it also didn't dumb it down

19:19.283 --> 19:20.868
or treat the audience like a kid.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.953
It just told stories.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.582
It told the stories
and it had a greater story to tell.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.960
<i>For us to be a successor,
we got to carry that DNA in.</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:32.296
Your heart may beat for me,

19:32.796 --> 19:34.381
but I can't feel it.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.428
You light up everything you touch,

19:40.095 --> 19:41.305
but never me.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.978
Every story we tell in the show
is born out of a human drive,

19:47.978 --> 19:52.524
<i>out of the characters showing the writers
where to take them.</i>

19:52.524 --> 19:54.526
<i>They're following those relationships.</i>

19:54.526 --> 19:57.487
<i>And it's really about driving
at the human heart.</i>

20:00.782 --> 20:03.452
<i>The world around these characters
might be chaos,</i>

20:03.452 --> 20:06.997
<i>but their humanity, their soul,
their internal feelings</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:09.750
and love for one another
is what's going to see them through.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.585
Right now, we have to be strong.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.669
For the team.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.714
For every mutant still out there
who's watching these images.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.382
They need hope.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.968
It's what the Professor would do.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.303
Then let's go remind the world

20:21.303 --> 20:24.056
that times like these
are when dreaming matters most.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.145
Our number one priority was to bring on

20:30.145 --> 20:34.399
as many of the original cast members
as we possibly could.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.611
<i>Back then,
we wanted to elevate the storytelling.</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:39.571
So one of the things that we did

20:39.571 --> 20:42.449
<i>was we auditioned people
who did stage plays</i>

20:42.449 --> 20:44.243
as opposed to voice actors

20:44.243 --> 20:47.162
who work just in, you know,
Saturday morning cartoon media,

20:47.162 --> 20:48.622
<i>because we wanted to get actors</i>

20:48.622 --> 20:52.251
<i>who have a range of inflections
in how they act,</i>

20:52.251 --> 20:54.628
and they didn't sound
like everybody else out there.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.798
I think it helped add to the character
and quality of the show

20:57.798 --> 20:59.883
<i>because they brought
the characters to life.</i>

20:59.883 --> 21:02.594
Don't you ever get tired
of listening to yourself?

21:02.594 --> 21:05.222
Not when I'm talking about you, <i>chère.</i>

21:12.354 --> 21:13.438
I had no clue

21:13.438 --> 21:15.983
about the X-Men at the time.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.653
I had never heard of the X-Men.
I don't think any of us had,

21:19.653 --> 21:20.988
except George Buza.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.074
They didn't tell us the title of the show
that we were going to read for.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.536
They said, "Project X."
And I'm reading and I'm reading.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.871
And I said, "This is <i>X-Men."</i>

21:29.871 --> 21:33.583
So strange, and yet so familiar.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.420
I used to buy a lot of comic books
when I was a kid.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.257
<i>And I remember
when the first</i> X-Men <i>comic book came out.</i>

21:40.757 --> 21:42.384
<i>And I saw it on the newsstand.</i>

21:42.884 --> 21:44.261
<i>And I do remember reading it.</i>

21:44.761 --> 21:48.056
And I knew right off the bat
that I was auditioning for <i>X-Men.</i>

21:48.056 --> 21:50.809
It appears to be a deliberate trail.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.228
I might as well have
gone and auditioned for <i>Star Wars.</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:54.521
<i>To be a part of that,</i>

21:55.188 --> 21:58.191
at that stage of my career,
was a real high point.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.610
You are a work of art.

22:03.572 --> 22:07.743
The majority of us
had done quite a bit of theater

22:07.743 --> 22:09.328
coming into the '90s.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.913
<i>I was a serious actor, you know.</i>

22:11.913 --> 22:14.499
I did movies, television, theater,

22:15.042 --> 22:16.710
a radio drama.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.837
I was not doing voiceovers,
I was a singer.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.839
I was doing jingles my whole life

22:20.839 --> 22:23.091
in the city of Toronto
and flying to New York,

22:23.091 --> 22:24.760
flying to Chicago, whatever, to sing.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.262
My background is very much

22:27.262 --> 22:28.597
the theater.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.599
<i>I'd done
a couple of voice things</i>

22:30.599 --> 22:31.850
<i>for commercials and stuff.</i>

22:31.850 --> 22:35.896
But my very first animated audition ever

22:35.896 --> 22:37.022
was this character.

22:37.022 --> 22:41.026
<i>My agent at the time
was here in Toronto, said,</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:43.528
<i>"Lenore, I want you to go in
for this new series.</i>

22:43.528 --> 22:48.992
<i>"They're looking for a sexy, husky voice
with a Southern accent."</i>

22:48.992 --> 22:52.829
And I'd played a lot of Southerners
in movies and television by that time.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.207
But I didn't go to the first auditions.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.751
I just wasn't that interested.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.712
You've given us a place
where we belong, Professor.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.007
Just takes us hard-headed ones
longer to realize it.

23:04.007 --> 23:07.052
So then, a few months go by
and they had callbacks.

23:07.052 --> 23:12.891
And she said, "Lenore, they haven't found
the right actress yet for this part

23:12.891 --> 23:14.142
"because it's you.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.686
"So get your ass in gear and go."

23:16.686 --> 23:18.105
So I did.

23:18.688 --> 23:22.150
And I walked into the studio,
put the headphones on.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.985
The producers were in LA.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.946
<i>I took a look at the picture
of the character,</i>

23:25.946 --> 23:27.864
<i>I was like, "Yeah, hell yeah,
I can do that."</i>

23:27.864 --> 23:31.493
And then I just opened up my mouth
and basically said,

23:32.077 --> 23:33.995
"You know, my daddy'd like to kill himself

23:33.995 --> 23:36.289
"when he found out I was a mutant."

23:36.289 --> 23:37.499
You know?

23:37.499 --> 23:40.794
And I heard all these screams
and yells and everything.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.422
They're like, "Don't let her
leave the building.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.881
"That's her. That's Rogue."

23:44.881 --> 23:47.634
This is going to be more satisfying
than I thought.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.512
<i>Once we heard the audition,
we said, "Okay, that's it. We got it."</i>

23:50.512 --> 23:52.514
It was the same with Wolverine.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.266
This one's mine.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.185
<i>I went in and they showed me
a picture of him.</i>

23:57.185 --> 23:59.813
They explained who he was and stuff,
that he was Canadian.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.939
I said, "That's good."

24:00.939 --> 24:04.609
The first line was like, "All right,
you egg-sucking piece of gutter trash.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.737
"You always did like picking
on people shorter than you.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.990
"Well, I'm shorter. Pick on me."

24:11.324 --> 24:13.952
They just went, "Oh, gosh,
give him some more lines."

24:14.453 --> 24:17.372
So, it just happened like that.
It was like it was meant to be.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.250
Just call me Wolverine.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.211
Wolverine.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.005
So impulsive.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.049
I identified with Hank right off the bat.

24:28.049 --> 24:31.428
<i>When I was a kid in school, I got bullied.</i>

24:31.428 --> 24:33.263
<i>I was a big kid. I was overweight.</i>

24:33.263 --> 24:35.765
<i>I got into quite a few beefs
on the schoolyard,</i>

24:36.266 --> 24:39.352
<i>and it was there that I learned
that even though I'm big,</i>

24:39.352 --> 24:43.857
<i>if you retaliate,
you will be the one who they blame.</i>

24:44.483 --> 24:46.318
<i>So think before you act</i>

24:46.318 --> 24:49.070
and try and defuse a situation
and walk away.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.822
And this is what Hank does.

24:50.822 --> 24:55.160
They must see that we are not a threat
to mankind, but are a part of it.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.914
<i>He won't resort
to his abilities, his superpowers</i>

24:59.414 --> 25:01.917
<i>unless there's absolutely
no other recourse.</i>

25:01.917 --> 25:05.170
<i>He will try and talk
and reason his way out of a situation</i>

25:05.170 --> 25:06.838
<i>before he will use violence.</i>

25:07.297 --> 25:08.423
But then when he does,

25:08.965 --> 25:09.966
watch out.

25:13.303 --> 25:17.724
I summon the full power of the storm!

25:17.724 --> 25:22.687
<i>I had gotten this audition
for my very first animation,</i>

25:22.687 --> 25:24.564
and I was out in Stratford,

25:25.065 --> 25:26.858
and I was doing Shakespeare.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.279
And I really only had one day
that I could come into the city.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.198
<i>Everything was very rushed.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:37.327
<i>And so, I'm looking
to hold on to why I'm there</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:40.580
<i>and what can I possibly
bring to this audition?</i>

25:40.580 --> 25:42.624
And then they said that she was a queen.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.502
And I went, "Okay,
I don't know a whole lot about her,

25:46.002 --> 25:47.087
"but I can do queen."

25:47.087 --> 25:49.381
I must keep my emotions in check,

25:49.923 --> 25:52.676
lest my powers rage out of control.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.471
<i>She played right
into my very natural strengths.</i>

25:56.471 --> 25:58.098
I've never been a subtle actress.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.393
You know, I do it big.
Go big or go home.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.771
I am free!

26:08.358 --> 26:09.651
I'm fond of the Nightcrawler.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.779
Our time together meant a great deal
to both of us.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.364
<i>I just remember they called me in,</i>

26:14.364 --> 26:17.534
and there was this moment of...

26:18.618 --> 26:20.328
landing in the part.

26:20.328 --> 26:24.165
And he was both passionate,
but yet spiritual.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.626
<i>There's something gentle about him,
but also fierce.</i>

26:26.626 --> 26:29.796
<i>I remember finishing the read,
and there was this pause.</i>

26:30.297 --> 26:33.883
And I looked over into the booth
at Dan Hennessey, who was the director,

26:33.883 --> 26:35.802
and he paused, and looked at me,
and he goes,

26:36.720 --> 26:38.388
"He's a very passionate guy, isn't he?"

26:38.888 --> 26:40.390
And I was like, "Yeah.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.018
"Do you want to do it again?" "Sure."

26:43.018 --> 26:46.062
And so that was
my very first animated audition.

26:46.062 --> 26:49.649
<i>And there was something about the script,
the complexity of the character,</i>

26:49.649 --> 26:51.776
<i>which just brought it out of me.</i>

26:51.776 --> 26:53.236
I am overwhelmed.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.905
You X-Men
are experienced with such things.

26:55.905 --> 26:57.782
You've come
to the right place, honey.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.079
<i>When we first started the series,</i>

27:03.079 --> 27:08.251
we recorded together possibly six
of us in the studio at a time.

27:08.251 --> 27:12.589
What they found is there was
too much spill happening between mics,

27:13.423 --> 27:16.468
not to mention that we could barely
get the scenes done

27:16.468 --> 27:18.094
because we were laughing so hard.

27:19.012 --> 27:24.142
Not at the script, just at the goofs
in the room that were so talented.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.270
He better be more careful with his mouth.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.731
You better stop worrying about my mouth,

27:30.273 --> 27:32.442
and start worrying about these.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.280
I mean, I just remember my first day
in the studio, there was Cal Dodd,

27:37.280 --> 27:40.033
<i>there was Lenore Zann,
and it was pretty wild.</i>

27:40.033 --> 27:41.493
I saw Cal Dodd

27:42.535 --> 27:44.996
hunch his shoulders up and make fists,

27:44.996 --> 27:47.499
and then suddenly his name dropped
into the voice and said,

27:47.499 --> 27:49.709
"Listen here, bub."
And I was like, "Oh, okay."

27:49.709 --> 27:53.421
<i>It really taught me
that doing animated voices</i>

27:53.421 --> 27:56.049
<i>is not just standing
in front of a mic not moving.</i>

27:56.049 --> 27:58.718
<i>There's actually, like,
full body expression involved.</i>

27:58.718 --> 28:01.304
You cannot conceive, nor can I,

28:01.304 --> 28:04.391
the appalling strangeness
of the mercy of God.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.643
You were pulling punches
on the dock today.

28:07.519 --> 28:11.147
When we go up there,
if you want to end it, and end it fast,

28:11.690 --> 28:13.817
hit, and hit to kill.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.861
I just interrupt everybody
because I'm Wolverine.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.447
<i>Rogue would be in the middle of something
really important,</i>

28:19.447 --> 28:22.617
and I'll say,
"Are you just about finished?

28:23.785 --> 28:26.204
"There are other people here
that have to talk, too."

28:26.204 --> 28:27.997
Stuff the philosophy.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.709
Let's go kick his butt.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.919
At one point, they were turning off
my microphone.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.880
I said, "Don't you do that.
Leave that on, because this'll be good."

28:35.880 --> 28:38.800
I go where I wanna go.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.301
<i>It was magical.</i>

28:40.301 --> 28:44.764
It was a really magical chemistry
that we all had.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.434
<i>Eventually, they split us up,</i>

28:47.434 --> 28:51.020
and yet we would all use the same studio,
so we'd see each other coming and going.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.314
<i>Everybody else had different jobs.</i>

28:53.314 --> 28:56.025
<i>Very few people do strictly voice.</i>

28:56.025 --> 28:58.361
At the time we were doing
the first couple of seasons,

28:58.361 --> 29:01.406
I was on another series
just around the corner from the here,

29:01.406 --> 29:04.409
<i>on</i> Maniac Mansion,
<i>which was a George Lucas thing.</i>

29:04.409 --> 29:08.246
I was doing Shakespeare
when I auditioned for this.

29:08.246 --> 29:11.791
For the whole first season,
I was in Stratford.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.586
<i>I had shows every night.</i>

29:14.586 --> 29:16.337
Monday was our dark day,

29:16.337 --> 29:20.467
<i>and so, every Monday,
I got in my car bright and early</i>

29:20.467 --> 29:23.303
<i>and came down and recorded</i> X-Men.

29:23.803 --> 29:27.849
Rise, fog,
and divert your enemy from her path.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.352
Storm, your master, commands.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.773
Back then, I was doing <i>Kung Fu</i>
with David Carradine,

29:34.773 --> 29:36.775
and it was a two-hander, more or less,

29:36.775 --> 29:40.153
so I was working 12, 14-hour days on that,

29:40.153 --> 29:43.740
and I would do <i>The X-Men</i>
literally on my lunch hour

29:43.740 --> 29:47.327
or in a break that I had that was
like lunch throughout the day.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.620
Relax, Cyclops.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.290
All work and no play
make Jacques a dull boy.

29:52.290 --> 29:56.795
<i>I'd have to drive from
the studio down to do</i> The X-Men,

29:56.795 --> 30:01.174
but not knowing
that it was actually becoming a hit.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.810
<i>I think it was just the word of mouth,</i>

30:11.810 --> 30:15.688
and we just heard gradually
that people were watching it

30:15.688 --> 30:21.277
and fans that normally might not be
into that type of animation

30:21.277 --> 30:24.280
and that storyline are talking about it.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.491
You don't know what you've done.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.701
You ain't seen nothing yet.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.621
<i>You know,
the characters are now iconic,</i>

30:31.621 --> 30:34.457
<i>but at the time, they were just, you know,</i>

30:34.457 --> 30:37.836
<i>these fascinating, complex characters</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:40.797
with some really interesting dialogue,

30:41.381 --> 30:42.882
dialogue with depth

30:42.882 --> 30:47.136
that you wouldn't expect
from a weekly cartoon.

30:47.136 --> 30:52.809
The Phoenix was a mythical bird
that was consumed by fire,

30:52.809 --> 30:56.771
but always rose again from the ashes.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.399
Perhaps that's what
the Phoenix represents.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.277
Hope, which never dies.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.778
When it was over after five years,

31:03.778 --> 31:05.989
I was like, I didn't know
what to do with myself.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.741
No more going to the studio to do him.

31:09.450 --> 31:12.328
Does he just fall off
the face of the earth? What's going on?

31:12.328 --> 31:13.746
I really missed him because

31:14.497 --> 31:15.874
he's me.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.293
This busted mug
ain't changed in a hundred years,

31:18.293 --> 31:19.419
and you know it.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.796
So it was so great to get back in him.

31:22.338 --> 31:27.302
Well, Magneto ain't gonna change his mind
just because we say "please."

31:27.886 --> 31:30.179
The man just declared war
on the whole planet.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.599
His day ends one way.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.561
We were all gung-ho.
There's no question about it.

31:36.561 --> 31:40.231
I don't think there's a single person
that said, "I don't know.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.900
"Why would we want to do this?"

31:41.900 --> 31:44.152
<i>We went, "Oh, yes, absolutely. Let's go."</i>

31:44.152 --> 31:46.446
It's been too long, my friend.

31:46.446 --> 31:50.366
You know, what's really cool
is that it's the same studio

31:50.366 --> 31:55.121
<i>that we recorded</i> The X-Men <i>in,
in the '90s.</i>

31:55.705 --> 32:00.376
I am Storm, mistress of the elements.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.212
<i>I value it
in a completely different way.</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:07.258
<i>And the time that I spend in the studio,</i>

32:07.258 --> 32:10.887
I appreciate and love it so much more.

32:10.887 --> 32:14.974
Surrender the boy or face my fury.

32:14.974 --> 32:18.811
I love this stuff.
I love this character. I love this show.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.897
Let them thunder,

32:21.731 --> 32:24.567
for I am lightning!

32:24.567 --> 32:26.361
I did go back and revisit the show

32:26.361 --> 32:29.739
because I wanted to, you know,
make sure that I was going to be true

32:29.739 --> 32:31.783
<i>to the character
that was created years ago.</i>

32:31.783 --> 32:35.119
I just remember it just literally
all came flooding back to me.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.580
None of you were there
the day Genosha fell.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.333
Who dies next, Professor?

32:40.333 --> 32:42.627
Jean? Been there, done that.

32:42.627 --> 32:46.172
<i>I watched a couple of the episodes,
like "A Rogue's Tale,"</i>

32:47.215 --> 32:50.718
<i>you know, and my voice
is naturally there anyway.</i>

32:50.718 --> 32:53.388
And so it just came back really quickly.

32:53.388 --> 32:57.392
<i>And then when I walked in the studio
the very first time,</i>

32:57.934 --> 33:02.230
<i>I was a little nervous 'cause I was like,
"Oh, my God. Do I still have it?"</i>

33:02.814 --> 33:06.693
And within two seconds, really,
of opening up my mouth

33:06.693 --> 33:08.653
and saying the first couple of lines,

33:08.653 --> 33:10.905
I was like, "Yeah."

33:10.905 --> 33:16.577
It's like a well-worn leather jacket
that you just slip in and away you go.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.789
You went slower
than snails in maple syrup.

33:19.789 --> 33:23.710
I reckon we nab him now
before our mystery boys move him again.

33:23.710 --> 33:28.089
It's so funny how my lines
stick in my head.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.717
Some of the best lines
that I've had, you know, like,

33:31.217 --> 33:33.428
"You look about as nervous
as a long-tailed cat

33:33.428 --> 33:34.971
"in a room full of rocking chairs."

33:34.971 --> 33:37.223
And yet, here you are,

33:37.724 --> 33:40.435
dragged in like a kitty cat's prize.

33:42.937 --> 33:45.023
Cable?
- Huh

33:45.023 --> 33:47.817
Chris Potter, who played Gambit
in the original series...

33:47.817 --> 33:49.861
Everyone can relax.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.822
Gambit has returned.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.492
...is actually voicing the role of Cable,
who's a massive part of the season.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.494
I know all I need to know.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.705
That machine killed my mother.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.833
We need to make sure
he doesn't do the same to anyone else.

34:03.833 --> 34:07.086
A couple centuries late
on the overprotective dad bit, huh?

34:07.086 --> 34:08.296
Both of you, stop it!

34:08.296 --> 34:11.758
I'm going to miss Gambit,
but I'm loving doing Cable.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.927
I'm so excited
about where we're headed with this.

34:15.803 --> 34:18.765
Am I going to war or a circus?

34:18.765 --> 34:21.184
What'd you expect? Black leather?

34:21.684 --> 34:23.686
<i>There's also
a lot of great newcomers</i>

34:23.686 --> 34:25.605
<i>who are bringing new characters to life</i>

34:25.605 --> 34:29.025
and who are giving us new takes
on the characters from the original show.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.694
The name's Gambit. Remember it.

34:31.694 --> 34:32.779
For this show,

34:32.779 --> 34:38.451
I got a weird laundry list
of just characters, all with fake names.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.995
I think Gambit
was, like, Johnny or something.

34:40.995 --> 34:44.248
<i>And the reference
was Chris Potter as Gambit.</i>

34:44.248 --> 34:45.666
And I was like, "Hold on."

34:45.666 --> 34:48.127
Then I looked through all the female
and male reference.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.296
I was like, "Okay, this is <i>X-Men."</i>

34:50.296 --> 34:52.632
So I kind of freaked out a lot.

34:52.632 --> 34:58.471
<i>And I made the probably very, very, very
dumb decision to only audition for Gambit</i>

34:58.471 --> 35:03.392
because there was no prehistory
with doing, really, a Cajun accent.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.186
I mean, I would do an impression of him

35:05.186 --> 35:07.313
between me and one of my friends
in high school.

35:07.313 --> 35:10.274
"Are you an assassin or a thief?"
we used to say, like <i>"mon ami."</i>

35:10.274 --> 35:14.529
You stopped the bad guys,
saved the kid, got home safe.

35:14.529 --> 35:17.156
These beignets needed me
more than you did, <i>mon ami.</i>

35:17.156 --> 35:19.951
You know, I took French because of Gambit.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.787
And this is probably
the lamest thing I could say.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.664
But we were allowed to choose names.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.624
And so I chose Remy, of course.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.417
But then I would sign it Remy LeBeau.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.419
And my teacher thought that was so cute.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.088
She was like, "Remy the handsome."

35:32.088 --> 35:34.507
And I was like,
"Yeah, that's what I meant."

35:34.507 --> 35:35.842
Not "I want to be Gambit."

35:35.842 --> 35:38.344
I can't believe I get to say this.
I'm so excited.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.430
<i>Mon ami,</i> maybe Gambit
should have played less rough with you

35:41.430 --> 35:43.141
in the Danger Room, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

35:43.141 --> 35:45.226
But the cards, they're wild.

35:46.811 --> 35:52.316
Would we be here helping the survivors
if we cared about staying alive?

35:52.859 --> 35:54.569
We care about others.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.529
As do most, I believe.

35:56.529 --> 35:59.657
I got a email asking
if I could audition for Charles.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.827
And I was over the moon, obviously,

36:02.827 --> 36:05.830
because I was a big fan of the show
from the early years.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.123
I'm a mutant.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.750
Telepathy. Mind reader.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.836
Likely can control them, too.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.962
Bend their will.

36:13.462 --> 36:17.133
I remember the first recording.
I was doing a few takes.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.552
And then I just had to stop for a second

36:19.552 --> 36:22.889
and look at, you know, the writers

36:22.889 --> 36:25.224
and the producers,
and casting director, and director.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.434
And I just said,

36:26.434 --> 36:29.020
"I can't tell you how tickled I am
to be a part of this,"

36:29.020 --> 36:32.440
because when I say this show was
the reason why I got into voice acting,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.151
<i>it was also the reason
why I got into acting in general.</i>

36:35.151 --> 36:38.321
I mean, this show was so important to me
growing up as a kid.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.199
<i>Just the fact that it's gone
full circle now, 30 years later.</i>

36:41.199 --> 36:45.995
<i>Now I'm a grown man
and I get to share this beautiful story</i>

36:45.995 --> 36:49.373
<i>with my nieces and nephews
who are about that same age.</i>

36:49.373 --> 36:50.708
It just blows my mind.

36:50.708 --> 36:54.003
And I'm so, so grateful
to be a part of this.

36:54.003 --> 36:59.467
Help the world see, by being different,
we all share something.

37:00.718 --> 37:01.969
You're him!

37:02.470 --> 37:04.639
- You're...
- Magneto.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.766
<i>I didn't grow up with the original show</i>

37:06.766 --> 37:09.477
in the way that a lot
of my contemporaries did.

37:09.977 --> 37:13.940
So for Magneto,
the team gave me a list of episodes.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.276
<i>They're like, "Here's the list
of the ones that your character is in</i>

37:18.027 --> 37:21.239
"that you should go to first
just for reference."

37:21.239 --> 37:24.825
So I went back and then watched
as much of it as I could

37:24.825 --> 37:27.662
<i>to get a good feel of both the show
and the characters.</i>

37:27.662 --> 37:29.622
<i>So I knew the context of it.</i>

37:29.622 --> 37:30.748
<i>Then looking up David,</i>

37:30.748 --> 37:34.085
<i>who voiced it in the original series,
and going, "He was English-Canadian</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:35.670
"and also had a theater background."

37:35.670 --> 37:37.713
His background and training
wasn't different.

37:37.713 --> 37:40.424
And his voice was
in the same sort of tenor as mine.

37:40.424 --> 37:45.304
So I went, "Oh, I think I can actually
probably come close to what he was."

37:45.304 --> 37:50.643
My intentions here
were not to cause drama or discord.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.603
Okay, prove it.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.690
Let Jean scan your mind,
see your real plans.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.150
- Scott, no.
- What?

37:58.651 --> 38:00.987
Even if I sensed
Magneto's intentions were sincere,

38:00.987 --> 38:04.156
that's today, this hour, this minute.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.909
I was familiar with the original show

38:06.909 --> 38:09.453
because the '90s rocked
and it was super fun.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.539
Like most of us workaday voice actors,

38:11.539 --> 38:13.541
the way this started for me
was an audition.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.794
<i>They send the copy and you read it
and you go, "Oh, my God, I love this.</i>

38:16.794 --> 38:18.254
<i>"I really would love to do this."</i>

38:18.254 --> 38:19.755
<i>Then you throw your heart into it.</i>

38:19.755 --> 38:22.967
And if you're lucky, you happen to fit
the recipe they're making.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.427
It's like you said, Scott.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.929
What have we been fighting for
all these years

38:26.929 --> 38:30.016
if not the chance
to finally live our lives?

38:30.016 --> 38:31.475
The team will be fine.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.978
Our son will need us more.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.814
Deep down, you know that.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.860
I am so enjoying living in this character

38:40.860 --> 38:44.155
who has all this complexity
and all these things going on

38:44.155 --> 38:48.200
in the face of giant robots,
and horrible villains,

38:48.200 --> 38:50.786
<i>and what's going on
inside the X-Men this season,</i>

38:50.786 --> 38:51.996
<i>which is pretty intense.</i>

38:52.496 --> 38:55.666
Beast's tests won't change the fact
that I'm Nathan's mother.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.502
I know. No one is saying that.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.171
Just...

39:00.880 --> 39:02.423
With the Professor and Storm gone,

39:02.423 --> 39:04.050
and Magneto here,

39:04.050 --> 39:05.676
it's been a lot for everyone.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.180
I didn't grow up with the show,
so I wasn't familiar with the characters

39:09.180 --> 39:11.140
as much as the other kid next door.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.309
Rogue, the Professor entrusted us

39:13.309 --> 39:16.020
with his dream
of mutant-human coexistence.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.605
We have to stay vigilant,

39:17.605 --> 39:19.398
no matter how good things seem out there.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.234
<i>I auditioned
for Scott Summers, Cyclops.</i>

39:22.234 --> 39:24.653
<i>They were looking for
a strict, strict voice match.</i>

39:24.653 --> 39:27.239
Name's Cyclops. Definitely the good guy.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.033
Did an okay job at it.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.995
But Meredith Layne, the casting director
and voice director on this project,

39:32.995 --> 39:35.706
knew that I could do better
and gave me a callback

39:35.706 --> 39:39.377
with, I think, the subtext of,
"Ray, take this one seriously."

39:39.377 --> 39:40.836
So I took it really seriously.

39:40.836 --> 39:44.507
<i>I started to figure out
who this character was, researched clips.</i>

39:44.507 --> 39:46.675
<i>And Norm Spencer's Cyclops</i>

39:46.675 --> 39:50.096
<i>is something that I was not
super familiar with coming into it.</i>

39:50.096 --> 39:52.223
<i>But once I started watching
the original series</i>

39:52.223 --> 39:56.811
and especially two long-form interviews
with Norm on the show,

39:56.811 --> 39:58.938
I listened to them,
absolutely devoured them

39:58.938 --> 40:00.272
and fell in love with the guy.

40:00.272 --> 40:03.776
I do think that it's just such a tragedy
that we lost him

40:03.776 --> 40:06.070
right before this show
was even getting made.

40:06.070 --> 40:10.574
I think that he would've absolutely loved
the chance to be with his friends

40:11.117 --> 40:12.201
one last time.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.870
And I dedicate this performance to him.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.499
Different generations
have their own view of Cyclops,

40:18.499 --> 40:20.918
have their own ideas
about what he should be.

40:20.918 --> 40:24.630
And I just hope that I'm able to please
as many of those people as possible.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.799
To me, my X-Men.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.890
The X-Men
<i>is a story about mutants.</i>

40:34.890 --> 40:36.809
<i>It's a story about outsiders.</i>

40:36.809 --> 40:40.187
<i>It's a story about people protecting
a world that fears and hates them.</i>

40:40.187 --> 40:43.107
But these mutants, these <i>Homo superiors</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:45.985
that have evolved past <i>Homo sapiens</i>
are human.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.154
<i>They're human in their hearts,
in their souls.</i>

40:48.154 --> 40:50.364
<i>They fall in love. They feel envy.</i>

40:50.364 --> 40:51.991
<i>They feel remorse.</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:53.576
<i>They feel affection.</i>

40:53.576 --> 40:56.579
It's actually an incredibly
emotional story between characters

40:56.579 --> 40:59.540
that make a lot of sparks
when they collide into each other.

40:59.540 --> 41:04.545
<i>And that's not just in these amazing
splash page action scenes,</i>

41:04.545 --> 41:08.799
<i>but also in the human drama
behind each one of their relationships.</i>

41:09.383 --> 41:10.551
You hurt me.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.802
As you did me.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.680
Countless times.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.890
Both of us.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.851
But we never abandoned each other.

41:19.351 --> 41:20.728
I loved the scripts.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.772
You could look at them
from so many different levels.

41:24.315 --> 41:29.069
And I've always been really interested
in mythology ever since I was a kid.

41:29.069 --> 41:33.407
So, for me, I looked at them as archetypes

41:33.407 --> 41:37.286
<i>and almost like the Greek
or Roman gods and goddesses.</i>

41:40.206 --> 41:42.625
Your parents don't know, do they?

41:45.920 --> 41:48.047
Some sort of solar energy.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.423
Still figuring it out.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.967
Makes me strong, though. Really strong.

41:51.967 --> 41:55.262
Whenever I do this,
it just reminds me that I'm different.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.014
That I'm lying to them.

41:57.806 --> 41:59.266
Be an X-Man, Jubilee?

42:00.184 --> 42:01.602
I don't even want to be myself.

42:01.602 --> 42:05.272
The writing that we had for five years
was unbelievable.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.566
And it's just continuing.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.859
We...

42:09.693 --> 42:11.028
had a dream.

42:13.155 --> 42:14.281
Charles.

42:14.281 --> 42:18.369
Yes. A dream that made us a family.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.414
And like that dream,
any family worth having...

42:22.414 --> 42:23.999
Is worth fighting for.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.128
What was interesting, you know,
I think for all of us

42:28.128 --> 42:30.631
<i>who are grateful
to be invited back to the show</i>

42:31.131 --> 42:34.510
<i>is we want to see where it goes now,</i>

42:34.510 --> 42:38.222
<i>because 30 years later
there are different concerns,</i>

42:38.847 --> 42:41.016
<i>different aspects to society</i>

42:41.016 --> 42:44.144
<i>that hopefully will be incorporated
into the show.</i>

42:44.144 --> 42:50.234
And we'll see how the X-Men
deal with everything that is of today,

42:50.943 --> 42:55.322
because that will bring in new fans
as well as the old ones.

42:55.322 --> 42:59.785
<i>Those themes of loss
and alienation and love and heartbreak,</i>

42:59.785 --> 43:02.204
those are all themes that can be addressed

43:02.204 --> 43:05.416
and can be understood
by literally anyone of any age.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.463
<i>And I think we go infinitely darker
and more realistic</i>

43:11.463 --> 43:16.135
<i>and more humanistic in our approach
with this iteration than ever before.</i>

43:16.135 --> 43:18.887
Everything around us
would not have been possible

43:18.887 --> 43:20.931
without the work of the X-Men.

43:20.931 --> 43:25.894
The general trajectory of this was
unlike any other show that I've worked on.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.479
<i>At the very, very beginning,</i>

43:27.479 --> 43:31.483
<i>we were going for strict 100%,
as if nothing changed.</i>

43:31.483 --> 43:34.236
<i>This is the exact same cast
sounding the exact same way.</i>

43:34.236 --> 43:36.030
Defend your master!

43:36.030 --> 43:37.156
Kid, get down!

43:37.156 --> 43:38.907
Erik!

43:38.907 --> 43:41.160
<i>And I think what we learned
going forward was</i>

43:41.160 --> 43:43.621
that type and style of delivery and acting

43:43.621 --> 43:46.498
that was more prevalent
in animated series of the '90s

43:46.498 --> 43:49.376
<i>just didn't quite hit right
with audiences today.</i>

43:49.376 --> 43:52.671
<i>It sounded a little bit like
we were trying to emulate a time capsule</i>

43:52.671 --> 43:54.173
<i>of a time that has passed.</i>

43:54.173 --> 43:57.051
And I think they made the right choice
to start dialing it back

43:57.051 --> 44:01.972
and put it more in a 2020s sensibility
of acting style.

44:01.972 --> 44:05.100
It was the most care and thought

44:05.100 --> 44:08.520
that I've seen put into any other project
that I've ever worked on.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.774
All this change?
It's all the same.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.443
Let us do what we do.

44:14.860 --> 44:19.323
Believe not in a dream or our gifts,

44:19.323 --> 44:20.908
but in each other.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.285
<i>It's a spiritual successor, right?</i>

44:23.285 --> 44:26.830
<i>So, having that wonderful perspective
of being a fan,</i>

44:27.331 --> 44:29.667
<i>knowing source material
and being able to go,</i>

44:30.459 --> 44:31.669
<i>"That feels right to me.</i>

44:32.294 --> 44:34.213
"That might feel right
to the audience." Or...

44:34.213 --> 44:36.382
You know, "The script is saying this.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.342
"I'm feeling like
this is honoring the script.

44:38.342 --> 44:41.011
"The script is honoring the comic."
This is all going together.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.972
There is a lot of pressure,
but when you love what you do

44:43.972 --> 44:46.725
and when you have a love
for the IP and the source material,

44:46.725 --> 44:48.477
it quiets all the other voices.

44:48.477 --> 44:50.229
Odds may be bad,

44:50.813 --> 44:53.857
but the cards
are always in the X-Men's favor.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.362
<i>Back in the '90s,</i>

44:58.362 --> 45:00.489
<i>when the writers were brought in
to work on the show,</i>

45:00.489 --> 45:02.491
they knew nothing about the X-Men.

45:02.491 --> 45:03.742
And I knew too much.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.954
So it was a great balance

45:06.954 --> 45:09.707
<i>because they knew
how to write great character dramas.</i>

45:09.707 --> 45:13.627
<i>And I knew all about who liked this one,
who didn't like this one,</i>

45:13.627 --> 45:16.046
<i>who hated who,
who's a brother, sister, all that stuff.</i>

45:16.046 --> 45:18.257
And I could just pour that out
for them to read.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.843
They also got
the Marvel handbook back then.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.136
So, all together,

45:22.136 --> 45:24.972
we were able to put together
some great stories

45:24.972 --> 45:29.768
<i>that felt like we kept the heart
of what fans would love.</i>

45:29.768 --> 45:33.772
<i>And then, also regular people
could just dive into the mythology</i>

45:33.772 --> 45:34.982
and enjoy the shows.

45:34.982 --> 45:39.570
As Archimedes said when he discovered
the principle of displacement,

45:40.487 --> 45:41.488
"Eureka."

45:42.114 --> 45:43.615
We've worked on other action shows

45:43.615 --> 45:46.076
and it tended to be
more about the plot and the action.

45:46.076 --> 45:48.036
And we started every episode

45:48.036 --> 45:51.623
as we started to think
about writing it about whose story is this

45:51.623 --> 45:53.792
<i>and how can we best reveal character?</i>

45:53.792 --> 45:58.297
<i>How can we make the deepest,
most intense Storm story or Rogue story?</i>

45:58.297 --> 46:01.300
We started thinking of them
as adult human beings

46:01.842 --> 46:04.595
<i>and then thought about them as people
that had superpowers.</i>

46:04.595 --> 46:08.682
I have been dedicated to the X-Men
since I was a teenager,

46:08.682 --> 46:11.810
never allowing myself
a life beyond my work.

46:11.810 --> 46:14.021
<i>And if you look
at each individual X-Men</i>

46:14.021 --> 46:16.273
<i>on the core team on</i>
X-Men: The Animated Series,

46:16.273 --> 46:20.736
each one of them was like the best
at that crazy, amazing superpower

46:20.736 --> 46:22.112
that they each had.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.282
But it was also the thing
that was their deepest sadness.

46:25.282 --> 46:27.659
<i>Rogue has got crazy powers,</i>

46:27.659 --> 46:30.579
<i>but if you swapped her powers
with Wolverine, she could've been happy</i>

46:30.579 --> 46:31.955
<i>because she could touch people.</i>

46:31.955 --> 46:34.374
<i>No need to pull out her claws
unless she chose to.</i>

46:34.374 --> 46:36.168
Rogue's story would have been different.

46:36.168 --> 46:39.463
And if Wolverine couldn't touch people,
fine, he'll go live in the woods.

46:40.255 --> 46:42.591
There's no place like home.

46:42.591 --> 46:45.052
<i>Cyclops,
you can't look him in the eyes.</i>

46:45.052 --> 46:48.347
<i>Here is this upright guy
who just wants to do the right thing,</i>

46:48.347 --> 46:50.724
<i>and he's got the shield between him
and the whole world.</i>

46:50.724 --> 46:53.519
So each one of them, the thing
that you go, "That's so cool,"

46:53.519 --> 46:56.688
is the thing that's the saddest,
most haunting moment for each of them.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.233
Some say they're freaks,

46:59.233 --> 47:00.776
some call them monsters,

47:00.776 --> 47:05.113
but all over the planet,
they are known as mutants.

47:05.113 --> 47:08.617
We only found out,
really, how successful the show was

47:08.617 --> 47:12.204
maybe, like, two years ago,
three years ago,

47:12.788 --> 47:17.251
<i>when we were asked to come
on a few Comic-Con tours.</i>

47:17.251 --> 47:20.504
<i>I was at the airport flying down
to one of the Comic-Cons,</i>

47:20.504 --> 47:25.008
and you have to clear Customs
in Canada to go to the States.

47:25.008 --> 47:28.804
So the American border guard asked me,
"Where are you going?"

47:28.804 --> 47:30.347
I told him the city I was going to.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.224
He says,
"What's your business down there?"

47:32.224 --> 47:33.684
I said, "I'm going to Comic-Con."

47:33.684 --> 47:34.893
He goes, "Comic-Con?"

47:34.893 --> 47:38.730
<i>I said, "Yeah, I'm one of the guests.
I'm one of the X-Men."</i>

47:38.730 --> 47:42.192
And he starts singing
the theme song.

47:42.192 --> 47:44.361
<i>And I told him, "Well, I played Beast."</i>

47:44.361 --> 47:45.612
<i>And he was all excited.</i>

47:45.612 --> 47:48.031
Blue blushes, too, my dear.

47:48.031 --> 47:50.492
It was a homecoming of sorts
for all of us,

47:50.492 --> 47:54.621
and great to see each other
after literally 25 years.

47:54.621 --> 47:57.708
It's just a bonding, big-time, all of us.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.543
Like, we went to Wales, for God's sakes.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.211
This is super.

48:01.211 --> 48:04.840
<i>What makes it all is the happiness
that you see on these people's faces.</i>

48:04.840 --> 48:08.594
<i>When we got to LA,
I did the one in LA, holy moly.</i>

48:08.594 --> 48:10.762
That was when we found out

48:10.762 --> 48:14.892
<i>how much it had changed
so many people's lives.</i>

48:14.892 --> 48:18.770
<i>I went into the green room
in Los Angeles for that event,</i>

48:18.770 --> 48:21.356
<i>not knowing what audience was out there.</i>

48:21.857 --> 48:25.736
And then they called us up onto a stage,
announced us,

48:25.736 --> 48:30.616
and literally stepped out from behind
the green room in a curtain onto a stage.

48:31.283 --> 48:34.244
And there were, to me, what appeared to be

48:35.120 --> 48:38.248
a few thousand people
in this convention center,

48:38.248 --> 48:39.750
jammed, standing.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.336
It was overwhelming to me.

48:44.379 --> 48:47.090
<i>I've had people come up
and saying that I made their childhood.</i>

48:47.090 --> 48:51.178
It was like the most enjoyable time
that they could go watch Saturday morning.

48:51.178 --> 48:55.349
<i>I've had people come and talk
about how Rogue's character,</i>

48:55.349 --> 48:57.309
<i>or Gambit's character,
or Wolverine's character,</i>

48:57.309 --> 48:58.894
<i>specifically helped them</i>

48:58.894 --> 49:01.647
<i>in certain situations
when they were growing up as a kid.</i>

49:01.647 --> 49:04.524
You know, kids that were maybe short
or being bullied,

49:04.524 --> 49:08.111
<i>that when they saw Wolverine
and how he didn't take much from anybody,</i>

49:08.111 --> 49:10.072
<i>the kids saw that as something</i>

49:10.072 --> 49:12.532
that they could incorporate
into their confidence.

49:12.532 --> 49:14.743
I don't hide from anybody, kid.

49:14.743 --> 49:16.536
I'm fighting my own battle right now.

49:16.536 --> 49:19.665
People just come up and say, like,
"You made my childhood.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.708
"Thank you so much.
I can't thank you enough."

49:21.708 --> 49:23.168
What a wonderful thing to say.

49:23.168 --> 49:25.379
<i>We thought we were making
a piece of entertainment.</i>

49:25.379 --> 49:29.716
<i>Even though it was very topical
and very meaningful to the times,</i>

49:29.716 --> 49:32.260
we didn't think
that we were actually affecting people

49:32.260 --> 49:33.971
<i>in that much of an emotional way.</i>

49:33.971 --> 49:37.766
We're Canadian.
Most of the time, we're humble,

49:37.766 --> 49:41.687
and we were just gobsmacked, blown away

49:41.687 --> 49:45.732
by the fact that our work could have had
that effect on so many people.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.567
<i>And we still are to this day.</i>

49:47.567 --> 49:51.238
<i>We love meeting our fans
and it really means a lot to us.</i>

49:52.030 --> 49:54.992
Always thanking the fans
for supporting the show

49:54.992 --> 49:56.827
and supporting...

49:57.577 --> 49:59.454
this fanboy to get that on the air

49:59.454 --> 50:04.042
<i>so I can show everyone that
you can do something more sophisticated</i>

50:04.793 --> 50:07.087
<i>than what was being done back in the '90s.</i>

50:07.087 --> 50:09.506
<i>Like, don't write down to kids,
write up to kids.</i>

50:09.506 --> 50:11.925
<i>They're going to see the explosions
and laser beams</i>

50:11.925 --> 50:13.093
<i>and all that kind of stuff.</i>

50:13.093 --> 50:16.930
But as they saw it in reruns,
they catch more of the adult subtext,

50:16.930 --> 50:19.558
what we were trying to put out there,
and it worked.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.101
Why do you hate us?

50:21.101 --> 50:22.811
What did we ever do to you?

50:23.395 --> 50:25.897
You were born.

50:25.897 --> 50:26.982
Take her away.

50:27.941 --> 50:30.819
You wouldn't be so brave
if my hands weren't tied.

50:30.819 --> 50:34.156
<i>For me, the original series
was definitive X-Men.</i>

50:34.156 --> 50:38.952
And to some degree, I just would love
if this became, for other kids

50:38.952 --> 50:40.746
and other adults and other teens,

50:40.746 --> 50:44.041
a place that they see themselves
and their X-Men.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.669
<i>'Cause every generation
has their own version of a superhero,</i>

50:47.669 --> 50:50.547
and there's so many young kids
that don't know <i>X-Men</i> the way I did.

50:50.547 --> 50:53.008
And to get to see it in this form,

50:53.008 --> 50:55.010
I'm hoping excites them
the way it excited me.

50:55.010 --> 50:58.263
You no longer need to live in darkness.

50:58.263 --> 51:00.682
You are outcasts no more.

51:01.183 --> 51:04.019
<i>There's sometimes a tendency
with children's programming</i>

51:04.019 --> 51:08.356
to imagine an idealized version
of a kid's life

51:08.356 --> 51:10.692
that is insulated
from the trauma of the world.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.943
We know that's not the case.

51:11.943 --> 51:14.571
It wasn't the case in the '90s
when I was watching it,

51:14.571 --> 51:16.448
and it's certainly not the case today

51:16.448 --> 51:18.825
with everyone's access
to the Internet and social media.

51:19.409 --> 51:20.869
<i>Kids see the world around them.</i>

51:20.869 --> 51:22.537
<i>They see the racism in our world.</i>

51:23.121 --> 51:25.457
<i>They see environmental calamities
in our world.</i>

51:25.457 --> 51:26.625
<i>They see social unrest.</i>

51:26.625 --> 51:29.044
<i>And I think that the show
is a place for kids</i>

51:29.044 --> 51:30.796
<i>to find an outlet for that emotion,</i>

51:30.796 --> 51:33.173
to make them feel like
they're not isolated and alone

51:33.173 --> 51:34.466
to deal with these anxieties,

51:34.466 --> 51:36.802
that this is something that we all share

51:36.802 --> 51:39.930
and that, like the X-Men,
can all persevere above together.

51:39.930 --> 51:42.641
<i>The strongest thing
to superhero stories,</i>

51:42.641 --> 51:45.185
<i>whether it's sci-fi stories,
whether it's horror stories,</i>

51:45.185 --> 51:48.814
is that what they do is they allow us
to look at the human stories

51:48.814 --> 51:53.193
and look at the difficult parts of it
and not make people feel targeted.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.112
Because it's not about
this particular group.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.114
<i>It's about superheroes. It's about aliens.</i>

51:57.114 --> 51:58.907
<i>It's about supernatural, whatever.</i>

51:58.907 --> 52:00.951
<i>So we can address a lot of these things</i>

52:00.951 --> 52:04.579
in a way that is not necessarily
making somebody feel

52:04.579 --> 52:07.124
like you're antagonizing them
or criticizing them.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.876
You can do it in a way
that makes people watch it and go, like,

52:09.876 --> 52:12.546
"Oh, they're dealing with the stuff
I was dealing with."

52:12.546 --> 52:14.214
Or hopefully, alternatively,

52:14.214 --> 52:16.883
"Oh, well, that kinda looks like
the way I behave,

52:16.883 --> 52:19.177
"and that might not be the best way
to treat people."

52:19.177 --> 52:23.515
Indeed, the odds remain reckless,
but if we all work in perfect unison,

52:23.515 --> 52:26.017
we may just spare our world
a dinosaur's fate.

52:26.017 --> 52:29.771
I think these stories are beautiful places
for kids and adults to come together

52:29.771 --> 52:32.566
and deal with the things of life, right?

52:32.566 --> 52:35.485
<i>Even if they're fantastical stories,
they're still human themes.</i>

52:35.485 --> 52:38.864
What are demons,
but reflections of our fears and shame?

52:38.864 --> 52:42.534
We need heroes
more than we've ever needed heroes.

52:42.534 --> 52:45.829
And I think this is the time
where we're going to have to dig deep

52:46.329 --> 52:51.626
and find our inner hero, our own personal,
the hero that we carry around inside,

52:51.626 --> 52:56.006
and the need to do right for ourselves,

52:56.506 --> 52:59.467
<i>for each other, for the planet.</i>

52:59.467 --> 53:00.969
That is universal.

53:00.969 --> 53:03.346
That is a universal message.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.432
<i>And it goes throughout history,</i>

53:05.432 --> 53:11.062
<i>because throughout history, obviously,
there have been problems with countries,</i>

53:11.062 --> 53:15.066
<i>nationalities, races, genders,</i>

53:15.066 --> 53:17.319
<i>you know, people trying to make a duality</i>

53:17.319 --> 53:19.821
when really we need
to be working together.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.866
My past is too littered with error.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.076
Mine was, too, remember?

53:25.577 --> 53:28.496
But the X-Men still took me in.

53:28.496 --> 53:32.542
The thing is,
I didn't go about demanding their trust.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.627
I earned it.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.128
<i>It's a show
about tolerance.</i>

53:35.128 --> 53:38.048
<i>The way you can open up a dialogue
to talk to somebody,</i>

53:38.048 --> 53:39.341
<i>to be able to hear them,</i>

53:39.341 --> 53:42.928
not to say you necessarily
agree with them, right?

53:42.928 --> 53:45.513
But to hear them,
to understand how they are as a person,

53:45.513 --> 53:48.475
to be able to communicate to them
the way they need it,

53:49.226 --> 53:51.311
<i>to potentially have them hear your side.</i>

53:51.311 --> 53:54.898
Charles Xavier entrusted me
with his dream,

53:55.440 --> 54:00.278
and it does not ask you to love
or embrace my kind as your own,

54:00.820 --> 54:04.532
but merely to accept
that this is a shared world

54:04.532 --> 54:05.992
with a common future,

54:06.576 --> 54:11.498
<i>and that my kind, like yours,
have the right to live in it.</i>

54:12.832 --> 54:15.961
<i>I love the fact that</i> X-Men
<i>does represent tolerance,</i>

54:16.461 --> 54:19.005
<i>intolerance, prejudice, found family,</i>

54:19.005 --> 54:21.800
<i>tribe, self-acceptance,
you know, in its IP.</i>

54:21.800 --> 54:24.302
<i>And the fact that we don't shy away
from that in this show,</i>

54:24.302 --> 54:27.973
which I think has been beautifully done
from day one,

54:27.973 --> 54:29.975
that's what I hope people
take away from it.

54:29.975 --> 54:31.184
Stand down, team.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.311
We can't give up.

54:35.397 --> 54:36.439
No, Rogue.

54:37.983 --> 54:41.278
We're gonna do what we've been telling
humanity to do for years.

54:41.278 --> 54:43.071
Stop fighting the future.

54:43.071 --> 54:44.281
And embrace it.

55:23.236 --> 55:25.947
And then I think it's...

55:31.536 --> 55:33.330
- Something like that.
