WEBVTT

02:47.061 --> 02:50.221
Farewell, Pinky.

02:55.597 --> 02:57.629
The potatoes!

03:01.894 --> 03:03.991
Potatoes?

03:03.992 --> 03:05.990
Potatoes...

03:05.991 --> 03:07.389
Pinky...

03:07.390 --> 03:09.197
Pinky, what do you mean?

03:10.564 --> 03:12.131
Oh...

03:13.192 --> 03:15.197
Oh, Pinky.

03:41.127 --> 03:43.395
Be free, Sylvia.

03:45.994 --> 03:47.331
Don't worry.

03:47.332 --> 03:48.730
I'll be OK.

03:48.731 --> 03:51.831
I wasn't always this alone.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.758
My childhood
was full of people.

03:55.432 --> 03:57.098
Hmm...

03:58.266 --> 04:01.294
Dad used to say that childhood
was like being drunk.

04:01.295 --> 04:05.491
Everyone remembers
what you did, except you.

04:05.492 --> 04:08.323
But my childhood
was sobering, Sylvia.

04:08.324 --> 04:10.356
I remember everything,

04:10.357 --> 04:13.557
right from the start.

04:13.558 --> 04:16.828
I'd always liked
feeling caged in,

04:16.829 --> 04:20.098
snug, and protected.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.564
It was a shock
to be born premature.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.928
I wasn't fully baked,

04:25.929 --> 04:29.131
and looked like a baby rabbit.

04:29.999 --> 04:33.422
I was named
Grace Prudence Pudel.

04:33.423 --> 04:36.764
My twin brother, Gilbert.

04:36.765 --> 04:39.157
The nurse said
we had two souls,

04:39.158 --> 04:41.497
but one heart.

04:41.498 --> 04:44.195
Mmm. I liked that.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.530
Our birth was
very strenuous for Mum,

04:47.531 --> 04:50.530
and she died.

04:50.531 --> 04:52.564
We left her womb

04:52.565 --> 04:55.263
and she entered her tomb.

04:56.359 --> 04:57.830
Mother snails do the same

04:57.831 --> 05:00.065
after they've had their babies.

05:00.831 --> 05:02.527
Don't they, Sylvia?

05:06.500 --> 05:08.096
As I grew older,

05:08.097 --> 05:10.630
I suffered a smorgasbord
of afflictions.

05:12.229 --> 05:16.129
I was always back in hospital
for something.

05:16.130 --> 05:18.590
The doctor said
I was like a china doll

05:18.591 --> 05:21.263
you could shatter
with just a stare.

05:22.331 --> 05:26.257
Eventually, they needed to
fix my floppy lip.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.461
Things went bad.

05:39.664 --> 05:41.663
I lost so much blood,

05:41.664 --> 05:43.865
I needed a transfusion.

05:43.866 --> 05:47.665
The doctor asked Gilbert
if he'd give me his.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.288
Huh?

05:53.694 --> 05:55.527
Oh.

05:58.862 --> 06:00.329
He said yes,

06:00.330 --> 06:04.455
even though he thought
he'd have to die to save me.

06:04.456 --> 06:06.628
How long before I die?

06:07.799 --> 06:10.159
They quickly explained
he wouldn't die.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.155
His body would make new blood.

06:12.156 --> 06:14.359
Oh.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.860
He became everyone's hero
that night.

06:16.861 --> 06:19.164
Especially mine.

06:19.863 --> 06:21.227
To cheer me up,

06:21.228 --> 06:24.327
Dad gave me
Mum's old jewellery box.

06:24.328 --> 06:27.428
Ooh!

06:32.030 --> 06:34.431
Inside, it had
her snail collection,

06:34.432 --> 06:36.763
and her ring.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.763
She'd loved snails as well,

06:38.764 --> 06:41.228
and had been a malacologist.

06:41.229 --> 06:43.761
I thought Gilbert
should have the ring.

06:43.762 --> 06:45.230
Ooh.

06:45.231 --> 06:48.593
I'm going to wear this
till the day I die, Gracie.

07:14.963 --> 07:16.956
Despite my woes, Sylvia,

07:16.957 --> 07:21.822
I believed in glasses half-full
and silver linings.

07:21.823 --> 07:25.061
Gilbert's glass
was half-empty, though.

07:25.062 --> 07:28.032
I remember
how he was often sad.

07:28.033 --> 07:31.495
It seemed like he had a secret
he wanted to tell.

07:31.496 --> 07:36.564
He was like Holden Caulfield,
James Dean and Charlie Brown

07:36.565 --> 07:38.522
all rolled into one.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.397
He saw people as a threat.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.930
At school, he was always
my warrior, my defender.

07:45.931 --> 07:48.422
Rabbit face, rabbit face,

07:48.423 --> 07:50.727
rabbit face, rabbit face.

07:52.897 --> 07:54.422
Give me that.

08:03.664 --> 08:05.396
Hey, morons.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.462
Hmm?

08:34.333 --> 08:35.893
Agh!

08:49.795 --> 08:51.930
...able to breed
a chicken with a giraffe.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.261
He said that
he's able to lay eggs,

08:53.262 --> 08:54.895
but has a really long pecker.

08:54.896 --> 08:57.488
Our home was our sanctuary,

08:57.489 --> 08:59.460
a place where we felt safe

08:59.461 --> 09:03.860
to read our books
and watch our favourite shows.

09:07.227 --> 09:10.557
I loved my bedroom.

09:10.558 --> 09:15.964
It's where
everything was just so.

09:15.965 --> 09:18.861
Right angles brought me
enormous comfort,

09:18.862 --> 09:21.395
as did my snails, Sylvia.

09:22.633 --> 09:25.224
They were my friends,

09:25.225 --> 09:28.291
so I made more of them.

09:28.292 --> 09:30.825
I knew they'd never leave me,

09:30.826 --> 09:32.593
hurt me.

09:33.630 --> 09:35.197
Or die.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.529
I didn't like people dying.

09:41.864 --> 09:44.157
I wanted to save people.

09:44.158 --> 09:46.230
Save the homeless.

09:47.194 --> 09:49.729
My favourite was James.

09:53.229 --> 09:56.095
One Christmas,
I covered him in decorations

09:56.096 --> 09:58.527
so he could feel
some Christmas cheer.

09:59.764 --> 10:02.461
He loved his tea.

10:03.634 --> 10:05.990
Huh?

10:05.991 --> 10:07.663
Ah! Ah.

10:07.664 --> 10:09.426
Ah...

10:09.427 --> 10:14.098
Good on ya, little possum.
Good on ya.

10:15.326 --> 10:16.964
He was once a magistrate,

10:16.965 --> 10:19.729
but was defrocked
for masturbating in court.

10:21.895 --> 10:23.528
Back then,

10:23.529 --> 10:26.192
I thought masturbation meant
chewing your food thoroughly.

10:27.664 --> 10:28.930
He once told me that

10:28.931 --> 10:32.263
masturbation
was the thief of time.

10:32.995 --> 10:35.098
- Ooh!
- Huh?

10:37.900 --> 10:40.528
James gave me
my first real snail.

10:40.529 --> 10:41.761
Ah!

10:41.762 --> 10:43.659
Your mum, Sylvia.

10:45.164 --> 10:48.092
He told me to put her
in a big jar

10:48.093 --> 10:51.524
and feed her Vegemite.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.161
While I was busy
trying to save the world,

10:54.162 --> 10:56.497
Gilbert wanted to
break free from it.

10:57.994 --> 11:00.026
Free others.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.462
Huh?

11:03.696 --> 11:05.294
Ugh!

11:05.295 --> 11:09.230
Once, he let our neighbour's
cockatoo escape.

11:14.294 --> 11:16.328
Fly, Mildred!
Come on, fly!

11:21.663 --> 11:23.296
Bye, Mildred!

11:23.297 --> 11:26.527
Gilbert said Mildred
never seemed so happy.

11:30.867 --> 11:33.597
If he wasn't
letting animals free,

11:33.598 --> 11:35.494
he was rescuing them.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.263
He didn't
care about the dangers.

11:42.931 --> 11:44.758
I'll save it, Gracie!

11:49.633 --> 11:51.494
- Gilbert!
- Ah!

11:57.599 --> 11:59.423
Come on, fella!

11:59.424 --> 12:01.990
Agh!

12:11.391 --> 12:13.527
Over here, Gracie!

12:17.065 --> 12:19.894
Gilbert loved animals
so much

12:19.895 --> 12:22.593
he became a vegetarian.

12:27.792 --> 12:31.362
Aww!
Now she's got a boyfriend.

12:35.998 --> 12:38.527
Look, Gracie,
they're hugging.

12:40.763 --> 12:42.725
Ugh...

12:44.996 --> 12:47.096
Eggs, wow!

12:47.097 --> 12:49.591
We'd created
our own little family.

12:49.592 --> 12:52.626
They hatched, Gracie!
Babies!

12:54.033 --> 12:58.128
You became
my favourite, Sylvia.

12:58.129 --> 13:02.228
Your swirl went opposite
to the others.

13:02.229 --> 13:06.527
Gilbert named you after
Mum's favourite author.

13:10.496 --> 13:14.092
But the thing that
made Gilbert really unique

13:14.093 --> 13:17.692
was his love of fire.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.758
He wanted to eat it.

13:25.461 --> 13:29.428
He'd spend hours
playing with fire.

13:53.729 --> 13:58.296
I remember how he always
smelt like burnt matches.

13:59.459 --> 14:02.831
At school, the girls swooned.

14:02.832 --> 14:05.892
He was the flame,
they were the moths.

14:07.330 --> 14:11.359
But he was more interested
in reading, and magic.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.360
I think he just wanted
to disappear.

14:14.361 --> 14:18.329
And spend all his pocket money
at Bert's.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.359
Bert was the type of person

14:26.360 --> 14:29.790
parents told you to avoid,
Sylvia.

14:29.791 --> 14:33.494
Someone who might offer you
boiled lollies.

14:33.495 --> 14:35.461
Ooh.

14:36.527 --> 14:39.494
Bert seemed
anything but magical.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.193
Gilbert's dream was

14:49.194 --> 14:51.194
to be a street performer
in Paris.

15:03.097 --> 15:04.857
Look, Gracie!

15:06.491 --> 15:08.659
He was always practising.

15:11.399 --> 15:13.032
Oh, shit!

15:14.362 --> 15:17.028
Ow, ow, ow!

15:17.029 --> 15:19.395
And often burnt himself.

15:22.527 --> 15:24.765
We got little scars
from the sparks.

15:24.766 --> 15:27.257
And when we
put our arms together,

15:27.258 --> 15:30.357
they formed a face.

15:30.358 --> 15:31.930
Oh, look, Gracie!

15:31.931 --> 15:35.290
It felt great
when we did this.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.824
Our feelings aligned.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.794
A lot of twins
say this, Sylvia,

15:41.795 --> 15:44.092
and it's true.

15:44.093 --> 15:46.192
I felt his emotions,

15:46.193 --> 15:50.256
his happiness
and his sadness.

15:50.257 --> 15:51.556
Which seemed to be

15:51.557 --> 15:54.657
the fourth member
of our family.

15:54.658 --> 15:57.622
Mum's death had left a hole.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.061
Dad had tried to fill the void,

16:00.062 --> 16:03.461
but... he had his own problems.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.656
Dad was French,

16:06.657 --> 16:11.531
and had once been
an animator in Paris.

16:11.532 --> 16:13.323
He made stop-motion films

16:13.324 --> 16:15.458
with an old Bolex camera.

16:18.128 --> 16:20.692
He showed them to us
sometimes.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.597
To pay for his art form,

16:30.598 --> 16:32.563
he busked on the streets.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.557
Bonjour, messieurs dames,

16:37.558 --> 16:39.465
Je suis
l'incroyable Percy Pudel.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.690
Mum met him on a holiday

16:40.691 --> 16:43.164
she'd won in
the Woman's Weekly magazine.

16:45.465 --> 16:47.461
Hep-ah!

16:50.492 --> 16:52.531
Oh!

16:52.532 --> 16:54.626
Et voila, messieurs dames.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.290
Ohh...

17:00.430 --> 17:02.391
Wow!

17:02.392 --> 17:04.425
Bonjour,
mademoiselle d'escargot.

17:10.632 --> 17:13.397
Ooh! Ooh, la, la!

17:16.359 --> 17:17.591
They fell in love,

17:17.592 --> 17:20.126
and he followed her
back to Australia.

17:24.462 --> 17:28.032
Bonjour! Je suis
l'incroyable Percy Pudel.

17:28.961 --> 17:30.560
Wanker!

17:31.900 --> 17:33.730
Hey, w... Watch out!

17:33.731 --> 17:35.759
Agh!

17:44.395 --> 17:45.965
Mum had only just
got pregnant

17:45.966 --> 17:49.724
when his career was cut short
by a drunk driver.

17:49.725 --> 17:54.431
He never juggled again,
and became a paraplegic.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.464
Then, slowly,

17:56.465 --> 17:57.929
an alcoholic,

17:57.930 --> 18:00.890
just like the guy
who'd hit him.

18:01.866 --> 18:04.763
Money had
always been a problem.

18:04.764 --> 18:07.264
Much worse since his accident.

18:07.265 --> 18:11.626
His pension barely paid
for his wheelchair batteries.

18:13.731 --> 18:14.997
Winning Scratchies

18:14.998 --> 18:18.125
was the only thing
that brought him hope.

18:18.126 --> 18:20.792
We found them everywhere.

18:22.456 --> 18:24.324
To make matters worse,

18:24.325 --> 18:26.758
he developed sleep apnoea.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.329
Huh?

18:34.395 --> 18:36.563
We'd have to clap
to wake him up.

18:53.095 --> 18:54.590
Despite our hardships,

18:54.591 --> 18:58.928
our little family unit
was strong.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.695
And there was plenty of joy.

19:01.696 --> 19:03.065
Ready!

19:10.100 --> 19:14.428
Our happiest day was
when we went on the Big Dipper.

19:17.434 --> 19:19.098
It was scary.

19:20.131 --> 19:23.065
Scary because it was
100 years old.

19:24.292 --> 19:25.762
Wah!

19:25.763 --> 19:27.761
Dad felt alive,

19:27.762 --> 19:29.491
escaped his body.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.056
When he died,

19:38.057 --> 19:42.065
he said he wanted his ashes
sprinkled off the Big Dipper.

19:43.198 --> 19:45.559
The day got even better
on the way home

19:45.560 --> 19:49.024
when Gilbert found a Scratchie
on the ground.

19:49.025 --> 19:50.890
We won $20!

19:52.227 --> 19:53.596
So Dad bought 20 more.

19:55.357 --> 19:58.195
Too bad, Dad.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.431
He hated we had to
look after him.

20:03.627 --> 20:08.457
I suppose his cage
was his body.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.322
His glass wasn't full or empty.

20:11.323 --> 20:13.296
Just... a glass.

20:15.135 --> 20:18.692
Knitting and black jelly beans
were his other addictions.

20:19.692 --> 20:21.956
He was the one
who knitted my snail hat

20:21.957 --> 20:25.528
and made the eyeballs out of
his old juggling balls.

20:26.757 --> 20:29.062
The jelly beans
made his tongue all black,

20:29.063 --> 20:30.596
and his breath...

20:30.597 --> 20:32.531
...aniseedy.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.656
Watch, Gracie.

20:33.657 --> 20:34.930
We arranged them
on his head

20:34.931 --> 20:37.258
while he pretended
to be asleep.

20:37.259 --> 20:39.197
He let us do stuff like that.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.125
We were free to
do what we wanted, Sylvia.

20:47.126 --> 20:48.628
Ah!

20:50.231 --> 20:54.096
He said childhood
was life's best season.

20:54.097 --> 20:57.588
It never lasts,
but everyone deserves one.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.355
Oh, mon fils!

21:00.356 --> 21:02.056
Bravo, Gilbert!

21:02.057 --> 21:06.257
He was so proud Gilbert
wanted to be a performer,

21:06.258 --> 21:08.224
follow in his footsteps.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.464
Ah... Ohh!

21:10.465 --> 21:13.461
Bravo!

21:13.462 --> 21:16.455
That night, we got out
mum's jewellery box

21:16.456 --> 21:18.796
and sang our heads off.

21:18.797 --> 21:20.829
# ...gentille alouette

21:20.830 --> 21:23.962
♪ Alouette, je te plumerai

21:23.963 --> 21:26.861
♪ Je te plumerai la tete... ♪

21:26.862 --> 21:28.830
♪ Je te plumerai la tete

21:28.831 --> 21:30.696
# Et la tete!
Et la tete!

21:30.697 --> 21:32.728
♪ Alouette!
Alouette!

21:32.729 --> 21:34.894
♪ O-o-o-oh... ♪

21:38.561 --> 21:40.931
Hah. Good one, Dad.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.723
Later, dad got out
his old Bolex camera

21:43.724 --> 21:46.857
and gave me some tips
on how to animate.

21:50.792 --> 21:54.330
I wanted to become an animator,
just like him.

21:56.725 --> 21:59.864
To top the day off,
we had a competition

21:59.865 --> 22:02.728
to see who could create
the best hairdo.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.461
I won.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.256
I remember
the stillness that night...

22:14.591 --> 22:17.564
...the wonderful memories
of that day,

22:17.565 --> 22:19.461
fresh in our heads.

22:21.326 --> 22:24.857
A day so precious...

22:26.325 --> 22:27.923
...but fleeting.

22:39.222 --> 22:40.527
Huh?

22:53.931 --> 22:55.923
Despite our clapping...

22:56.764 --> 22:58.629
...this time,

22:58.630 --> 23:00.863
Dad never woke.

23:11.834 --> 23:14.393
We couldn't afford
a proper funeral,

23:14.394 --> 23:17.756
so Dad was cremated
by the government,

23:17.757 --> 23:22.162
his ashes given to us
in a cardboard box.

23:22.163 --> 23:25.960
I sprinkled him
into his jellybean jar.

23:25.961 --> 23:27.890
He would have liked that.

23:37.164 --> 23:39.524
Child services came
to take us away.

23:39.525 --> 23:42.857
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.960
And we were to be
sent to foster homes

23:45.961 --> 23:48.098
in separate states.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.227
We had no relatives,

23:52.228 --> 23:54.895
and no-one wanted to
adopt twins,

23:54.896 --> 23:57.923
especially weird ones like us.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.529
Look after it, Gilbert.

24:16.834 --> 24:20.128
Hurry up.
Say your goodbyes.

24:20.129 --> 24:22.458
Bye, Gracie.

24:22.459 --> 24:26.032
Bye, Gilbert.

24:30.001 --> 24:33.428
That was the last time
I saw my brother.

24:33.429 --> 24:37.494
The last time I smelled
his scent of burnt matches.

24:43.299 --> 24:46.498
We never got to sprinkle Dad
off the Big Dipper.

24:54.933 --> 24:57.192
Our lives were
turned upside down

24:57.193 --> 25:00.359
and back to front, Sylvia.

25:00.360 --> 25:03.594
We had no choice
but to move onwards.

25:03.595 --> 25:05.331
Upwards.

25:05.332 --> 25:06.692
Sidewards.

25:10.695 --> 25:14.998
I was sent to live with
a childless couple in Canberra,

25:14.999 --> 25:18.560
which had won safest city
three years in a row.

25:20.033 --> 25:23.065
Some people
even wore helmets driving.

25:29.234 --> 25:33.065
Back then, Canberra wasn't
the exciting place it is today.

25:35.629 --> 25:40.263
I suppose 'settled' is
the wrong word for how I felt.

25:41.131 --> 25:44.164
'Traumatised'
was more accurate.

25:46.165 --> 25:49.263
The separation from Gilbert
made me anxious.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.324
But you and your siblings,
Sylvia,

25:53.325 --> 25:55.560
you brought me some comfort.

25:58.829 --> 26:00.496
Lovely.

26:01.658 --> 26:05.125
My new foster parents,
Ian and Narelle,

26:05.126 --> 26:08.630
were... pleasant enough.

26:08.631 --> 26:09.931
They were accountants

26:09.932 --> 26:12.362
for a company that made
traffic lights.

26:13.831 --> 26:15.127
They were well-meaning,

26:15.128 --> 26:17.059
and addicted to
self-help books.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.697
Hm?

26:19.698 --> 26:22.493
- Good morning!
- Hey!

26:22.494 --> 26:25.596
They believed
a good dose of self-esteem

26:25.597 --> 26:28.361
cured everything.

26:28.362 --> 26:31.657
Every week, they'd make me
a new certificate.

26:31.658 --> 26:35.098
Our little baby.
Oh, we're so proud!

26:35.897 --> 26:37.761
Now, watch this.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.097
My finger work!

26:39.098 --> 26:41.758
On the weekends,
they'd play netball.

26:43.132 --> 26:45.393
Gracie, can you
get the ball for us?

26:45.394 --> 26:47.626
They tried to get me
to play as well.

26:50.127 --> 26:51.758
Here we go.

26:54.026 --> 26:55.090
Catch it!

26:55.091 --> 26:56.463
Oof!

26:56.464 --> 26:57.692
Oh, no!

26:59.033 --> 27:01.195
Ian!
What's happened to her?

27:01.196 --> 27:03.530
-You're right, babe.
-Babe?

27:03.531 --> 27:05.228
She's going blue!

27:05.229 --> 27:06.558
Sometimes I faked
asthma attacks.

27:06.559 --> 27:09.159
Hey, Narelle,
better get the puffer!

27:09.160 --> 27:10.831
I felt bad telling lies,

27:10.832 --> 27:13.423
but sport was
one of my allergies.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.192
You alright, babe?

27:15.193 --> 27:17.461
Breathe, pumpkin, breathe!

27:25.197 --> 27:28.725
Their favourite colour
was beige.

27:31.033 --> 27:34.227
They even had guinea pigs
that were beige.

27:34.228 --> 27:37.329
OK,
we're off now, pumpkin.

27:37.996 --> 27:40.230
- See you later.
- Bye.

27:41.364 --> 27:43.927
On Saturdays,
they went to key parties.

27:43.928 --> 27:45.128
Ready, love?

27:45.129 --> 27:47.197
I'm looking forward
to tonight, babe.

27:49.164 --> 27:51.392
They were swingers,
Sylvia.

27:51.393 --> 27:53.597
Darryl!

27:59.531 --> 28:00.657
Back then,

28:00.658 --> 28:03.890
I thought swinging
meant something else.

28:06.527 --> 28:09.193
My new school
was predictably bad.

28:09.194 --> 28:10.762
-Grace Pudel!
- Huh?

28:10.763 --> 28:12.593
Stop daydreaming.

28:16.130 --> 28:18.230
I tried to make friends.

28:19.562 --> 28:23.661
But Gilbert wasn't there
to break their fingers.

28:23.662 --> 28:25.663
So... Hmm...

28:25.664 --> 28:27.657
I absorbed the abuse,

28:27.658 --> 28:32.291
came home, and played with
my clay friends.

28:32.292 --> 28:35.126
I missed Gilbert like crazy.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.658
We wrote each other letters,

28:36.659 --> 28:40.428
and I saved every cent I could
to go see him.

28:42.025 --> 28:45.057
He'd been sent to live with
a family of fruit farmers

28:45.058 --> 28:46.725
near Perth.

28:48.264 --> 28:50.926
I definitely got
the better family, Sylvia.

28:50.927 --> 28:53.791
He HATED his.

28:55.128 --> 28:56.723
Dear Gracie,

28:56.724 --> 29:00.292
my new parents, Ruth and Owen,
are strange,

29:00.293 --> 29:02.693
and do a weird sort of praying.

29:11.561 --> 29:14.089
They make me pray
four times a day.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.230
They said the more I pray,

29:17.231 --> 29:19.923
the more the pain of
Dad's death will disappear.

29:21.432 --> 29:25.756
They're really old-fashioned,
and don't even have a phone.

29:25.757 --> 29:29.657
We all have to have magnets
taped to us.

29:29.658 --> 29:32.489
They reckon it keeps
our auras balanced,

29:32.490 --> 29:34.758
protects us from the devil.

29:36.494 --> 29:40.230
Ruth is obsessed
with her poor budgies.

29:41.397 --> 29:44.692
I reckon she loves them
more than her own kids.

29:48.257 --> 29:50.032
Worship thy apple!

29:50.033 --> 29:53.560
They've built
their own church and school.

29:55.065 --> 29:58.124
Owen is the minister.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.092
Cleanse thy soul!

30:04.726 --> 30:09.461
Cast out thy demons,
and worship thy fruit!

30:13.158 --> 30:14.824
Hm?

30:18.261 --> 30:19.994
He's got
stomach ulcers,

30:19.995 --> 30:22.032
which he blames on the devil.

30:30.559 --> 30:33.395
My new brothers
are all morons.

30:35.096 --> 30:37.956
One of them is always staring.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.494
Worship the baby Jesus!

30:48.563 --> 30:52.161
I have to work in
the orchard after school.

30:52.162 --> 30:55.428
The brothers
get the better jobs.

30:57.430 --> 31:00.527
Ruth said if I'm going to be
a good orchardman,

31:00.528 --> 31:04.428
I'd have to start at the bottom
and work my way up.

31:06.227 --> 31:08.428
I'd rather eat glass.

31:10.729 --> 31:11.791
Hmph!

31:12.729 --> 31:13.789
Ugh!

31:13.790 --> 31:16.160
Anyway,
they can all get stuffed,

31:16.161 --> 31:18.157
'cause as soon as
I'm old enough,

31:18.158 --> 31:19.422
and got money,

31:19.423 --> 31:21.327
I'm coming to get you.

31:21.328 --> 31:24.692
I'll walk across
that big, burning desert.

31:25.897 --> 31:27.356
We'll escape to Paris.

31:27.357 --> 31:29.326
I'll become a fire eater.

31:30.999 --> 31:33.890
And you'll become
an amazing animator!

31:42.094 --> 31:44.728
It'll be great.

31:59.428 --> 32:01.731
Gilbert's letters
gave me hope,

32:01.732 --> 32:04.492
so I tried to get on with life,

32:04.493 --> 32:07.927
squashing my sorrows
down into my shoes

32:07.928 --> 32:10.431
as the years dragged on.

32:10.432 --> 32:11.723
To pass time,

32:11.724 --> 32:14.760
I began volunteering
at the local library.

32:16.166 --> 32:20.728
One of my jobs was to erase
rude drawings done by boys.

32:20.729 --> 32:22.456
Ugh...

32:22.457 --> 32:25.190
That's when I first met Pinky.

32:27.428 --> 32:31.260
I saw her returning books
into a rubbish bin.

32:31.261 --> 32:33.689
She thought it was
the return chute.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.527
And had been doing it
for months.

32:37.194 --> 32:39.660
- Excuse me?
- Hm?

32:39.661 --> 32:40.690
Um...

32:40.691 --> 32:43.726
She was mortified
when I explained.

32:43.727 --> 32:45.094
Ah, poo.

32:45.095 --> 32:47.564
Don't worry,
I won't turn you in.

32:47.565 --> 32:49.861
Oh, thank you, dear.

32:49.862 --> 32:52.223
Bless your cotton socks.

32:52.224 --> 32:53.958
What's your name?

32:53.959 --> 32:55.958
Grace Pudel.

32:55.959 --> 32:58.397
Uh, I'm Pinky.

32:58.398 --> 32:59.892
Just Pinky.

32:59.893 --> 33:01.727
Like Cher.

33:01.728 --> 33:04.189
Or Liberace.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.155
Or Prince.

33:06.156 --> 33:08.759
Casanova!

33:08.760 --> 33:10.428
Popeye.

33:11.395 --> 33:13.556
People call me Pinky
'cause of this.

33:13.557 --> 33:16.423
Lost it dancing
in Barcelona.

33:22.093 --> 33:23.791
Agh!

33:27.494 --> 33:30.155
Why are you dressed
like an ant?

33:30.156 --> 33:32.157
Oh, um...

33:33.498 --> 33:35.331
No, I'm a snail.

33:35.332 --> 33:37.297
Oh!

33:37.298 --> 33:39.193
Funny.

33:39.194 --> 33:41.396
I used to think I was a pigeon.

33:43.656 --> 33:45.856
She was
a true eccentric,

33:45.857 --> 33:49.725
and smelt like ginger
and second-hand shops.

33:53.057 --> 33:54.593
Dickhead!

33:55.693 --> 33:57.789
She clothed herself
in corduroy,

33:57.790 --> 34:01.360
And her face had more wrinkles
than her jacket.

34:01.361 --> 34:03.190
It was hard to know
where the fabric ended

34:03.191 --> 34:05.224
and her skin began.

34:05.225 --> 34:07.159
Apart from you, Sylvia,

34:07.160 --> 34:09.528
she was my first real friend.

34:10.697 --> 34:13.024
My only real friend.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.493
She'd lived an amazing life.

34:17.494 --> 34:20.197
I thought one day I might
make a film about her.

34:21.262 --> 34:23.263
She'd seen the Northern Lights.

34:24.425 --> 34:26.397
Floated in the Dead Sea.

34:30.726 --> 34:33.924
Been an exotic dancer
in a schnitzel bar.

34:33.925 --> 34:35.296
Ha!

34:40.965 --> 34:42.999
Won a bee-beard contest.

34:43.699 --> 34:45.798
Hee! My turn.

34:45.799 --> 34:48.560
Bathed with
a snow monkey.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.857
Made love to John Denver...

34:53.863 --> 34:55.029
In a helicopter.

34:55.030 --> 34:58.230
Take me home,
country road!

35:00.995 --> 35:02.659
And once...

35:03.594 --> 35:05.624
...played ping pong
with Fidel Castro.

35:10.327 --> 35:11.525
She'd never been sick.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.358
Her secret to longevity
were coffee enemas

35:14.359 --> 35:16.864
and a daily shot
of ginger wine.

35:19.426 --> 35:22.058
She'd outlived
two husbands.

35:22.059 --> 35:23.724
The first, Hector,

35:23.725 --> 35:26.597
had died just a week
after they got married.

35:26.598 --> 35:28.423
Careful, sweetie.

35:28.424 --> 35:29.698
Agh!

35:31.531 --> 35:33.065
Bugger.

35:37.892 --> 35:41.824
Her second husband, Bill,
had been a postman.

35:43.098 --> 35:45.662
Who wrote love notes
on her mail.

35:47.423 --> 35:48.992
Roses are red,

35:48.993 --> 35:50.762
Violets are camp,

35:50.763 --> 35:52.365
I'll be your letter,

35:52.366 --> 35:54.630
You be my stamp.

35:54.631 --> 35:56.356
You are the clouds,

35:56.357 --> 35:58.696
And I am the skies,

35:58.697 --> 36:01.257
Let me shipwreck meself

36:01.258 --> 36:03.056
Between your thighs.

36:03.057 --> 36:04.497
Smile.

36:07.627 --> 36:10.692
Ready for my close-up,
Mr DeMille.

36:12.860 --> 36:15.823
They'd just begun
a trek across Australia...

36:15.824 --> 36:17.994
Just a little
to your left, sweetheart.

36:17.995 --> 36:19.622
...when nature struck.

36:19.623 --> 36:22.192
Oh! Oh! Oh!

36:23.357 --> 36:25.023
No!

36:27.091 --> 36:28.728
Bugger.

36:37.392 --> 36:39.391
Careful, kiddies.

36:39.392 --> 36:41.630
She was a real survivor,

36:41.631 --> 36:43.791
and had so many jobs.

36:44.927 --> 36:46.296
Dickhead!

36:47.259 --> 36:48.128
Dickhead!

36:48.129 --> 36:50.292
But they never
lasted long.

36:50.293 --> 36:52.696
You're fired.

36:52.697 --> 36:54.757
On her 80th birthday,

36:54.758 --> 36:58.956
she'd got a job
promoting pineapple chunks.

36:59.993 --> 37:01.591
Oh! Oh!

37:01.592 --> 37:04.758
Gosh, she had
a great sense of humour.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.122
She drove her dead husband's
postal truck

37:09.123 --> 37:12.063
and once told me she wanted to
die peacefully in her sleep

37:12.064 --> 37:14.822
like her cousin
who was a bus driver.

37:14.823 --> 37:18.930
Not screaming in horror
like his passengers.

37:18.931 --> 37:20.829
I'm not sure
whether she was joking.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.999
It was hard to know with her.

37:24.963 --> 37:28.032
Her house was fabulous.

37:30.801 --> 37:32.729
It smelt like popcorn
and mothballs.

37:38.561 --> 37:41.428
She had an enormous
trophy collection,

37:41.429 --> 37:44.722
which I soon discovered
were other people's trophies

37:44.723 --> 37:46.923
she'd found
at second-hand stores.

37:51.999 --> 37:54.895
There were Post-it notes
everywhere.

37:54.896 --> 37:57.263
She had a dreadful memory.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.390
She was terrified
of Alzheimer's

38:01.391 --> 38:03.689
and had taken up tap dancing.

38:03.690 --> 38:05.890
She'd read it
staved off dementia.

38:09.865 --> 38:11.260
She didn't believe in banks,

38:11.261 --> 38:13.790
and put her savings
in an old tin.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.422
She said she kept her secrets
in there as well.

38:17.423 --> 38:18.656
You know, Gracie,

38:18.657 --> 38:22.131
biscuit tins
rarely contain biscuits.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.822
I'd never seen
her mysterious tin.

38:25.823 --> 38:28.655
She was always hiding it
in different places,

38:28.656 --> 38:31.791
and often
couldn't remember where.

38:33.032 --> 38:36.360
Her home was also
full of seedlings,

38:36.361 --> 38:41.897
which she later confessed
were marijuana.

38:41.898 --> 38:45.355
She loved to bake
ginger hash-people,

38:45.356 --> 38:47.456
because, she said,

38:47.457 --> 38:49.890
they relieved her arthritis.

38:50.601 --> 38:52.723
She also enjoyed gardening,

38:52.724 --> 38:55.456
especially when
she felt a bit miserable.

38:55.457 --> 38:57.790
She called it her Pity-Pit.

38:57.791 --> 39:02.356
She wanted her ashes
sprinkled in her Pity-Pit,

39:02.357 --> 39:04.498
be returned to nature,

39:04.499 --> 39:07.032
fertilise her veggies.

39:08.162 --> 39:11.197
Gardening fixes everything.

39:17.867 --> 39:19.697
She also
enjoyed mini-golf,

39:19.698 --> 39:22.296
and had built her own course.

39:33.799 --> 39:37.329
Ha-ha! Hole in one!

39:37.330 --> 39:40.522
But the thing that
made Pinky truly remarkable

39:40.523 --> 39:42.356
was what she did every Monday.

39:42.357 --> 39:43.626
There, there.

39:43.627 --> 39:47.898
She'd visit the lonely,
and hold their hands.

39:47.899 --> 39:50.827
She said the thing
the elderly craved most

39:50.828 --> 39:52.690
was human touch.

39:52.691 --> 39:56.063
She'd sit with them calmly,
in silence.

39:56.064 --> 40:00.098
Something so simple,
yet so comforting.

40:00.929 --> 40:02.561
- Hm?
- Ah!

40:02.562 --> 40:06.131
An occasional ginger
hash-person helped as well.

40:10.795 --> 40:15.164
Pinky told me she'd never got
to hold her own parents' hands.

40:15.864 --> 40:17.961
She never said why.

40:17.962 --> 40:22.190
Her childhood was off-limits.

40:22.191 --> 40:24.329
Woo-hoo!

40:25.191 --> 40:26.459
You know,

40:26.460 --> 40:29.730
life isn't about
looking backwards, Gracie.

40:29.731 --> 40:33.230
It's about living forwards.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.963
She was the jewel
in the Canberra junk heap.

40:36.964 --> 40:39.795
She'd crammed so much
into her life,

40:39.796 --> 40:42.389
and I'd crammed nothing.

40:44.792 --> 40:47.795
Pinky's friendship
helped ease my sadness,

40:47.796 --> 40:50.161
my feelings of loss.

40:50.162 --> 40:54.465
I suppose SHE was
the medicine I needed,

40:54.466 --> 40:57.189
a vitamin for hope.

40:59.368 --> 41:00.730
Bugger.

41:00.731 --> 41:03.230
Better luck next time, Gracie.

41:05.934 --> 41:09.131
The years
fluttered past, Sylvia.

41:12.434 --> 41:14.129
Apart from Pinky,

41:14.130 --> 41:16.059
letters from Gilbert
were the only things

41:16.060 --> 41:18.428
that confirmed I existed.

41:29.799 --> 41:32.560
I missed Gilbert like crazy.

41:58.164 --> 42:00.158
Ian and Narelle
were still obsessed

42:00.159 --> 42:01.831
about my mental health,

42:01.832 --> 42:03.591
and sent me
to self-help classes.

42:03.592 --> 42:06.393
Which was supposed to
raise my endorphins,

42:06.394 --> 42:10.464
balance my chakra,
and cleanse my third eye.

42:10.465 --> 42:13.727
Ready, set, go!

42:13.728 --> 42:15.627
Ha! Ha!

42:15.628 --> 42:21.495
Ha! Ha! Ha!

42:21.496 --> 42:27.363
Ha! Ha! Ha!

42:27.364 --> 42:29.465
Ha! Ha!

42:29.466 --> 42:30.695
- Ooh.
-Ha!

42:30.696 --> 42:33.227
- Ha!
- Hm.

42:33.228 --> 42:35.660
Ah! Oh, Craig!

42:35.661 --> 42:39.631
- Mm! Heal me! Heal me!
-I'll heal you, Vicky.

42:39.632 --> 42:41.594
- I'll heal you.
- Oh, Craig!

42:42.899 --> 42:46.495
-  Oh, Craig!
-Oh, Vic.

42:47.560 --> 42:51.098
Part of me died
in those classes, Sylvia.

43:04.695 --> 43:09.664
Self-help was just
a shallow, quick fix.

43:09.665 --> 43:12.230
None of it actually worked.

43:12.231 --> 43:16.197
I just wanted the earth to stop
so I could get off.

43:17.900 --> 43:21.428
Puberty arrived,
and brought its gifts.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.791
I'd have loved a boyfriend.

43:31.996 --> 43:33.194
It didn't help matters

43:33.195 --> 43:35.626
when Pinky convinced me
to get a perm.

44:03.963 --> 44:05.528
Nice hairdo.

44:07.024 --> 44:08.659
Ha-ha!

44:14.024 --> 44:16.329
Dickhead!

44:17.062 --> 44:18.892
There, there, love.

44:18.893 --> 44:20.729
Ignore him.

44:20.730 --> 44:22.796
I think we look fabulous.

44:22.797 --> 44:24.864
Thank God for Pinky.

44:24.865 --> 44:27.424
She became
my real foster parent.

44:27.425 --> 44:29.324
Especially as
Ian and Narelle

44:29.325 --> 44:31.457
weren't around much anymore.

44:31.458 --> 44:33.491
They'd discovered nude cruises,

44:33.492 --> 44:35.324
and were gone for weeks
at a time.

44:35.325 --> 44:37.660
- Whee!
- Good morning.

44:37.661 --> 44:39.659
Oh, hi!

44:46.331 --> 44:49.363
I still grieved
the loss of my family,

44:49.364 --> 44:55.197
and continued filling the void
with more and more snails.

44:57.766 --> 44:59.860
If I saw something snail-y,

44:59.861 --> 45:02.930
it HAD to be mine.

45:02.931 --> 45:06.359
My obsession
had blossomed, Sylvia.

45:06.360 --> 45:10.258
My room had become
a snail... shrine.

45:10.259 --> 45:14.197
I'd become a snail hoarder.

45:19.832 --> 45:22.890
Oh, I missed Gilbert so much.

45:24.229 --> 45:26.861
His letters still gave me hope,

45:26.862 --> 45:29.722
but he began to worry me.

45:29.723 --> 45:31.890
I felt he wasn't
telling me everything.

45:32.897 --> 45:34.528
Dear Gracie,

45:34.529 --> 45:38.457
life at the Garden of Eden is
certainly no Garden of Eden.

45:38.458 --> 45:41.426
Gilbert!
Get back to work!

45:41.427 --> 45:44.795
Ruth seems to
have it in for me,

45:44.796 --> 45:46.696
but I don't give a stuff.

45:46.697 --> 45:49.090
- Sorry, Ruth.
- Ugh!

45:49.091 --> 45:54.362
Oh, and she hates that
I call her Ruth instead of Mum.

45:54.363 --> 45:57.461
And she hates that I won't
let Owen shave my head.

45:58.694 --> 46:01.759
They make me work really hard
for lousy money.

46:04.130 --> 46:05.956
There's no-one here to talk to.

46:08.095 --> 46:09.527
I try to be friendly,

46:09.528 --> 46:12.827
but their weirdo religion
has them all brainwashed.

46:14.262 --> 46:16.824
The brothers
really hate me.

46:17.765 --> 46:19.528
Poofter.

46:33.065 --> 46:35.456
Owen forces me
to read the Bible,

46:35.457 --> 46:37.389
and Ruth...

46:37.390 --> 46:39.059
...forces me to eat meat.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.924
Hello, piggies.

46:47.226 --> 46:48.559
Eat it!

46:48.560 --> 46:51.296
She's barred me
from playing with fire.

46:51.297 --> 46:56.094
She's bonkers, and thinks
magic is the devil's vice.

46:56.095 --> 46:57.493
And she's always
trying to stick

46:57.494 --> 47:01.256
more and more magnets
on me to fix my aura.

47:01.257 --> 47:03.065
But I don't care.

47:04.595 --> 47:07.861
I hide behind the church
to practice my stuff,

47:07.862 --> 47:09.894
with one of the brothers,

47:09.895 --> 47:12.461
who... seems to like me.

47:13.496 --> 47:17.626
Ruth reckons Lucifer's
trying to invade my soul.

47:19.360 --> 47:21.422
So they tried to baptise me,

47:21.423 --> 47:23.461
to get the devil out!

47:37.334 --> 47:38.993
Dunk thee,

47:38.994 --> 47:42.089
and cleanse thy demons!

47:42.090 --> 47:43.593
Ugh!

47:44.593 --> 47:47.098
I pretended
I was possessed.

47:47.099 --> 47:50.089
I hid some of Owen's
antacid tablets in my pockets.

47:51.094 --> 47:53.161
-  Oh, my!
- Ooh...

47:53.162 --> 47:55.056
It was hilarious.

47:57.862 --> 47:59.495
Ben loved it.

48:06.461 --> 48:09.093
Ruth is always
trying to control me.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.431
She even tried drugging me.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.725
Eat it.

48:20.663 --> 48:21.956
Hmm.

48:35.060 --> 48:36.791
But I'm not dumb.

48:38.556 --> 48:41.428
I hid the pills in my cheeks.

48:43.362 --> 48:46.722
Ruth says,
Jesus's love isn't free.

48:46.723 --> 48:49.531
So, what money
we do earn, Gracie,

48:49.532 --> 48:51.356
goes back to Jesus.

48:51.357 --> 48:53.124
Pennies for Jesus.

48:53.125 --> 48:55.758
Pennies for Jesus.

49:01.230 --> 49:05.157
Pennies for Jesus.
Pennies for Jesus.

49:05.158 --> 49:07.230
That's a good boy.

49:09.399 --> 49:10.825
Huh?

49:16.699 --> 49:19.890
Gilbert!

49:21.795 --> 49:25.626
And Jesus then
gives his money back to Owen.

49:27.129 --> 49:29.960
Thank you, Jesus.

49:29.961 --> 49:31.824
And his vices.

49:33.825 --> 49:38.155
Oh, Owen, how are you?
The usual?

49:44.194 --> 49:45.956
Have a good night.

49:50.067 --> 49:53.563
Pennies for Jesus,
and whiskey for Owen.

49:53.564 --> 49:55.696
Hm!

50:04.432 --> 50:06.292
Ah!

50:06.293 --> 50:08.431
They're such hypocrites!

50:09.599 --> 50:11.291
But I made them pay for it.

50:11.292 --> 50:14.422
Run free, guys. Come on! Run!

50:21.401 --> 50:23.529
I hate it here.

50:23.530 --> 50:25.356
No!

50:25.357 --> 50:27.693
- My budgies!
- Heh.

50:28.565 --> 50:30.593
And I hate her.

50:31.863 --> 50:33.891
She punished me.

50:33.892 --> 50:35.560
Big time.

50:43.458 --> 50:45.626
Hold him tight.

50:47.767 --> 50:51.425
Sinners must be punished,
Gilbert.

50:51.426 --> 50:54.355
Leviticus 24 -
an eye for an eye,

50:54.356 --> 50:56.531
a tooth for a tooth.

50:59.327 --> 51:02.758
Burn thy
wicked box of pleasures!

51:02.759 --> 51:06.858
She punished
me, but it didn't bother me.

51:06.859 --> 51:08.263
I'm fine.

51:10.128 --> 51:12.791
Anyway, I'd better go.

51:14.067 --> 51:16.559
I'm saving my money,
and I'll be escaping soon

51:16.560 --> 51:19.263
and crossing that desert
to come and get to you.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.560
Hang in there, Gracie.

51:35.896 --> 51:37.725
Everything is OK.

51:39.533 --> 51:41.331
See you soon.

51:41.332 --> 51:42.860
Hopefully.

51:42.861 --> 51:45.725
Love, Gilbert.

51:55.901 --> 51:59.230
Puberty finally finished
its cruelty, Sylvia.

52:00.294 --> 52:03.065
The season of our teens ended.

52:04.194 --> 52:05.557
Oh, bubbles!

52:05.558 --> 52:07.495
But life got even lonelier

52:07.496 --> 52:11.692
when Ian and Narelle retired
to a nudist colony in Sweden.

52:12.967 --> 52:15.359
It's a shame
we never really connected.

52:15.360 --> 52:18.058
What family
we did have, though,

52:18.059 --> 52:20.291
was now gone.

52:20.292 --> 52:22.131
Is that your foot?

52:25.833 --> 52:28.092
Despite my woes, Sylvia,

52:28.093 --> 52:30.124
I tried to be optimistic,

52:30.125 --> 52:32.032
be more social.

52:34.627 --> 52:37.355
I remember how there
were intriguing people

52:37.356 --> 52:39.032
at the library.

52:40.525 --> 52:43.692
But they lived vicariously.

52:45.527 --> 52:48.923
A boyfriend
seemed a work of fiction.

52:50.427 --> 52:54.758
I felt invisible,
began to fade.

53:01.461 --> 53:04.728
Pinky was the only colour
in my life,

53:04.729 --> 53:06.331
still effervescent.

53:07.423 --> 53:08.732
Her hand-holding idea

53:08.733 --> 53:11.030
had become
a fully-fledged charity.

53:11.031 --> 53:13.156
She'd even engaged
the long-term unemployed

53:13.157 --> 53:14.725
to help out.

53:16.393 --> 53:19.365
We went from home to home...

53:19.366 --> 53:21.098
...hand to hand.

53:30.726 --> 53:33.323
I think, over time,
the loss of my family

53:33.324 --> 53:36.329
had somehow... frozen me.

53:40.692 --> 53:42.828
I thought it was safer
to just...

53:42.829 --> 53:45.362
live in a pretend world.

53:46.527 --> 53:48.522
Oh, Dad would have been
disappointed

53:48.523 --> 53:51.032
I'd resorted to trashy novels.

53:51.934 --> 53:55.522
It was now just me,
some sexy pirates,

53:55.523 --> 53:57.795
and a few frisky guinea pigs

53:57.796 --> 54:00.426
who mocked my virginity.

54:00.427 --> 54:03.829
The stereotype
was now complete, Sylvia.

54:03.830 --> 54:06.327
I'd become an unloved recluse.

54:06.328 --> 54:09.389
And the guinea pig hair
that coated me,

54:09.390 --> 54:11.494
a lonely person's glitter.

54:17.425 --> 54:19.362
As my boredom worsened...

54:20.692 --> 54:24.124
...I found myself
having new urges.

54:26.262 --> 54:29.923
I added kleptomania
to my list of hobbies.

54:31.164 --> 54:35.129
Buying, hoarding,
and now stealing

54:35.130 --> 54:38.422
became a cheap thrill
and distraction

54:38.423 --> 54:40.692
from my mundane world...

54:42.032 --> 54:45.696
...which slowly
began to collapse.

54:50.195 --> 54:53.857
I lost three guinea pigs
that night.

54:56.692 --> 54:59.065
I cremated them
in the backyard...

55:00.000 --> 55:02.395
...and put their ashes
in little jars.

55:02.396 --> 55:05.999
It looked like I was starting
a guinea pig spice rack.

55:10.164 --> 55:13.722
My life had become
truly pathetic.

55:13.723 --> 55:16.791
And things had gotten
out of control.

55:18.162 --> 55:21.030
I held my own hand patiently,

55:21.031 --> 55:24.159
waiting for Gilbert to
come and rescue me,

55:24.160 --> 55:26.360
while I continued to withdraw

55:26.361 --> 55:29.923
into the safety of
my snail fortress...

55:30.631 --> 55:32.297
...lonely,

55:32.298 --> 55:33.728
loveless,

55:33.729 --> 55:35.956
and imprisoned.

55:45.363 --> 55:48.464
But just as I was considering
joining a nunnery...

55:49.797 --> 55:51.491
...from the mess of my life

55:51.492 --> 55:54.329
came one of those
silver linings.

56:01.797 --> 56:03.890
His name was Ken.

56:06.462 --> 56:10.331
And he was obsessed
with his leaf blower.

56:13.698 --> 56:14.864
There he stood,

56:14.865 --> 56:18.164
more delicious
than a Chicko Roll.

56:24.191 --> 56:25.999
Well, hi.

56:28.062 --> 56:30.890
Could I, uh, maybe, uh...

56:30.891 --> 56:34.062
He wanted to know
if he could blow my leaves.

56:34.063 --> 56:36.629
His presence gave me
hot flushes

56:36.630 --> 56:38.763
and sweaty knickers.

56:38.764 --> 56:41.630
It was love at first sight.

56:41.631 --> 56:45.255
He was a Canberra Adonis.

56:45.256 --> 56:47.131
A Cadonis.

56:52.832 --> 56:55.326
He was
a microwave oven repairman

56:55.327 --> 56:57.860
and told me that
he was extremely shallow

56:57.861 --> 57:00.023
and one-dimensional.

57:00.024 --> 57:03.796
He said if he was an onion
and you peeled back the layers,

57:03.797 --> 57:06.131
you'd just find more onion.

57:07.128 --> 57:08.798
He had hobbies like me,

57:08.799 --> 57:12.756
and enjoyed
repairing broken bowls.

57:12.757 --> 57:15.593
It was a Japanese art form
called kintsugi,

57:15.594 --> 57:20.126
based on the philosophy that,
just like the soul,

57:20.127 --> 57:22.489
all things can be repaired,

57:22.490 --> 57:25.230
and our cracks celebrated.

57:26.164 --> 57:27.831
Ken said that
I was a broken bowl

57:27.832 --> 57:30.322
and that he'd help repair
my wounds,

57:30.323 --> 57:32.560
fill up my cracks.

57:34.901 --> 57:38.394
He was so thoughtful
and community-minded

57:38.395 --> 57:41.595
he volunteered as
a lifeguard at the local pool.

57:41.596 --> 57:43.396
Mmm...

57:43.397 --> 57:45.131
Hello.

57:46.425 --> 57:48.593
He adored me,

57:48.594 --> 57:52.494
and even built a milkshake
station in my kitchen.

58:05.230 --> 58:07.696
We dated for a month,
and then...

58:07.697 --> 58:08.927
What do you reckon?

58:15.498 --> 58:17.098
Ooh!

58:20.296 --> 58:23.098
He said
he really did love me.

58:23.797 --> 58:25.660
Loved my quirks.

58:27.329 --> 58:30.327
We celebrated
with another milkshake.

58:30.328 --> 58:32.458
He said he'd make me
something special.

58:32.459 --> 58:36.157
Spoonful of that.
Hmm, cinnamon!

58:36.158 --> 58:37.891
- No!
- What?

58:37.892 --> 58:39.230
Oh! I...

58:40.394 --> 58:43.429
- That's my guinea pig.
- Oh!

58:43.430 --> 58:45.392
A normal person would
have thought I was bonkers,

58:45.393 --> 58:47.057
keeping those
guinea pigs' ashes.

58:48.225 --> 58:50.263
But he didn't.

58:51.798 --> 58:54.225
He loved all of me,

58:54.226 --> 58:57.098
even my bum and wobbly bits.

59:01.360 --> 59:04.495
Yeah. Nice. Oh, yeah!

59:04.496 --> 59:05.891
Oh!

59:05.892 --> 59:07.398
Yeah!

59:07.399 --> 59:08.563
Nice, Gracie.

59:08.564 --> 59:09.524
He moved in,

59:09.525 --> 59:12.164
and I finally lost
my virginity.

59:13.900 --> 59:16.362
We were desperate
to get pregnant.

59:17.097 --> 59:20.064
But Ken was told
he was sterile,

59:20.065 --> 59:22.927
from all those microwave ovens
he'd repaired.

59:22.928 --> 59:24.961
Rotten luck.

59:24.962 --> 59:27.262
But I wasn't too disappointed.

59:27.263 --> 59:30.629
I had more than I could ever
wish for, Sylvia.

59:30.630 --> 59:32.158
I had a Cadonis,

59:32.159 --> 59:34.257
a herd of guinea pigs,

59:34.258 --> 59:36.828
and a horde of snails.

59:36.829 --> 59:38.593
Say cheese, Gracie!

59:39.864 --> 59:41.830
We set a wedding date,

59:41.831 --> 59:43.858
and sent Gilbert the good news.

59:43.859 --> 59:45.362
Huh?

59:46.060 --> 59:48.059
Oh... Wow!

59:48.060 --> 59:50.560
Hey, Ben, guess what?

59:54.497 --> 59:58.096
Ken gave him money
for an airfare to Canberra.

59:58.097 --> 01:00:01.226
I asked Gilbert to walk me
down the aisle.

01:00:01.227 --> 01:00:04.758
Pinky would be the flower girl.

01:00:07.163 --> 01:00:09.994
We'd finally be a family again.

01:00:09.995 --> 01:00:12.527
Finally sprinkle Dad's ashes.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.996
My glass was now brimming,

01:00:16.997 --> 01:00:19.593
and there were
silver linings galore.

01:00:20.832 --> 01:00:23.026
Gilbert would live with us.

01:00:23.027 --> 01:00:25.560
He'd be here tomorrow!

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:35.659
I'd never felt so happy,
so optimistic.

01:01:02.896 --> 01:01:04.596
Delivery.

01:01:04.597 --> 01:01:06.428
I'll get it.

01:01:16.466 --> 01:01:18.290
Ooh!

01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:21.329
Oh, for you, dear.

01:01:25.028 --> 01:01:26.629
Dear Grace,

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:28.356
this is Ruth,

01:01:28.357 --> 01:01:30.356
Gilbert's foster mother.

01:01:30.357 --> 01:01:32.195
It saddens me to tell you

01:01:32.196 --> 01:01:35.122
that Gilbert has died
in an horrific fire.

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:39.095
Our church burnt down,

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:43.197
and he was unable
to escape the flames.

01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:51.090
Last week, I found Gilbert
and my son Ben...

01:01:51.091 --> 01:01:53.131
fornicating.

01:01:58.762 --> 01:02:00.231
Lucifer!

01:02:00.232 --> 01:02:02.494
I'm sure you will agree
our only course of action

01:02:02.495 --> 01:02:06.993
was to purge and correct
their homosexual sickness

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:08.423
in the correct fashion,

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:11.256
as instructed by... the Lord...

01:02:11.257 --> 01:02:13.296
...our saviour.

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.590
This was not a simple task.

01:02:16.591 --> 01:02:20.393
We could not just
pray the gay away.

01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:23.960
So the only solution
was a dual expulsion

01:02:23.961 --> 01:02:26.458
to cast the demons out,

01:02:26.459 --> 01:02:28.828
eject the devil
from their souls,

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:31.290
and correct their auras.

01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:34.190
Out, out, evilness!

01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:36.189
Out, out, Satan!

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.857
Saaa!

01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:43.926
The time has come!

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.761
Purge their souls!

01:02:48.697 --> 01:02:50.890
Cleanse their sickness.

01:02:53.763 --> 01:02:56.263
Gay, away!

01:02:56.929 --> 01:02:59.322
Out, gayness!

01:02:59.323 --> 01:03:01.498
Purge their souls!

01:03:01.499 --> 01:03:04.296
Out, out, Lucifer!

01:03:05.468 --> 01:03:07.894
Cast out thy demons,

01:03:07.895 --> 01:03:10.560
and shock the gay away!

01:03:16.764 --> 01:03:19.626
Ahhhhh!

01:03:33.764 --> 01:03:35.527
Enough.

01:03:37.128 --> 01:03:39.494
Excellent, excellent.

01:03:39.495 --> 01:03:44.323
I am glad to say,
for my son, this was a success.

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:45.957
But for your brother...

01:03:45.958 --> 01:03:47.027
Agh!

01:03:47.028 --> 01:03:49.524
...the devil would not vacate.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:53.726
And being
so full of Satan, well,

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:57.092
Agh!

01:03:57.093 --> 01:03:59.927
...he assaulted me.

01:03:59.928 --> 01:04:03.494
Lucifer!

01:04:12.191 --> 01:04:13.923
Get him.

01:04:16.193 --> 01:04:18.264
Look, an angel.

01:04:18.265 --> 01:04:19.857
Huh?

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.726
Liar!

01:04:29.258 --> 01:04:30.956
You Judas!

01:04:32.097 --> 01:04:34.322
He's escaping! Catch him.

01:04:47.725 --> 01:04:49.893
He then raced
to our church

01:04:49.894 --> 01:04:51.791
and set it alight!

01:05:20.191 --> 01:05:21.893
No!

01:05:21.894 --> 01:05:23.659
Gilbert, stop!

01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:35.965
He then sacrificed himself,

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:39.390
as penance for his sins.

01:05:39.391 --> 01:05:41.391
We tried to rescue him,

01:05:41.392 --> 01:05:44.598
but the inferno
was too intense.

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:47.365
The good Lord took his soul.

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:52.131
Let me out!

01:05:53.768 --> 01:05:57.189
And Lucifer
lost the battle.

01:06:13.329 --> 01:06:16.622
Now cleansed,
and with the baby Jesus.

01:06:16.623 --> 01:06:18.526
We had a memorial
for him,

01:06:18.527 --> 01:06:21.291
and are confident he is now
in a happier place,

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:24.527
with God and the baby Jesus.

01:06:29.025 --> 01:06:32.423
Please find enclosed a vessel
of your brother's ashes.

01:06:32.424 --> 01:06:34.759
I think it best you have them.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:39.389
Once again, I am sorry to be
the bearer of such tragic news.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.261
Gilbert was a good soul,

01:06:41.262 --> 01:06:46.225
who, sadly, fell
to repugnant persuasions.

01:06:46.226 --> 01:06:48.464
We will always pray for him,

01:06:48.465 --> 01:06:49.997
as well as you.

01:06:49.998 --> 01:06:53.824
Our deepest sympathies,
Ruth and Owen Appleby.

01:07:04.959 --> 01:07:08.530
Losing a twin
is like losing an eye, Sylvia.

01:07:09.891 --> 01:07:13.758
You never see the world
quite the same way again.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.459
Grief is a nothingness,

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.489
leaves a metallic taste
in your mouth,

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.131
places stones in your stomach.

01:07:26.995 --> 01:07:28.857
Tears don't flow.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:31.197
They're too scared.

01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:35.158
I no longer believed
in silver linings

01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:37.422
or glasses half-full.

01:07:37.423 --> 01:07:39.659
My glass was shattered.

01:07:40.392 --> 01:07:42.396
I'd lost my mother,

01:07:42.397 --> 01:07:44.122
father,

01:07:44.123 --> 01:07:45.725
brother.

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:56.959
Luckily, I had Pinky.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.289
Hey, Gracie.

01:07:58.290 --> 01:07:59.930
And Ken.

01:07:59.931 --> 01:08:03.758
His spoonfuls of love
kept me going.

01:08:06.533 --> 01:08:08.723
But, weirdly,

01:08:08.724 --> 01:08:12.755
my snails seemed like
my real family.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:16.290
Real ones horde together
when threatened.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.725
Survival in numbers.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:26.165
I was emotionally attached
to every single one of them.

01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:30.857
That's why I couldn't ever,
ever throw any of you away.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.056
So I kept buying,

01:08:35.057 --> 01:08:36.992
adding,

01:08:36.993 --> 01:08:38.890
and stealing.

01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:50.564
Eventually...

01:08:50.565 --> 01:08:52.422
Excuse me, madam.

01:08:52.423 --> 01:08:54.531
I got caught.

01:08:54.532 --> 01:08:57.197
The shame was crushing.

01:08:59.964 --> 01:09:02.329
And there were consequences.

01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:09.363
Oh, Gracie.

01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:19.463
And then...

01:09:20.763 --> 01:09:23.098
...things got even worse.

01:09:24.325 --> 01:09:26.089
Love can be blind.

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.129
Huh?

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:32.263
It can hide
darkness and horror.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.728
It seemed Ken's onion
did have layers.

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:42.692
He didn't love ME.

01:09:43.665 --> 01:09:45.957
He loved my FAT!

01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.890
He had some sort of... fetish.

01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:58.765
He didn't want to fix my bowl.

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:01.431
He wanted to fill it,
and fill it,

01:10:01.432 --> 01:10:03.362
and fill it...

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:05.923
...with lard.

01:10:05.924 --> 01:10:09.456
It was one thing for me to
create a cage for myself.

01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:10.956
Bit of duck, for luck.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:14.322
It was another for
someone else to imprison me.

01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:15.491
Nice, Gracie.

01:10:15.492 --> 01:10:18.324
I knew he admired
my... largeness.

01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:19.828
But this was something more.

01:10:19.829 --> 01:10:22.162
Oh, yeah! Nice.

01:10:22.163 --> 01:10:26.696
He said he'd love me more,
the bigger I got,

01:10:26.697 --> 01:10:29.191
and now I knew why.

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:32.158
What an idiot I was.

01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:34.329
But not for much longer.

01:10:48.567 --> 01:10:50.263
Oh!

01:11:03.533 --> 01:11:05.122
Sorry, Gracie.

01:11:23.935 --> 01:11:27.664
Pinky moved in
and tended to my wounds.

01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:29.996
I'd read that snails hibernate

01:11:29.997 --> 01:11:32.861
when they needed
to repair themselves.

01:11:32.862 --> 01:11:35.191
I slept for a week,

01:11:35.192 --> 01:11:37.494
and wrestled my demons.

01:11:55.158 --> 01:11:57.330
Uhhhh!

01:12:00.796 --> 01:12:02.895
I loathed myself.

01:12:02.896 --> 01:12:06.224
My hoarding had caused this.

01:12:06.225 --> 01:12:07.930
It had kept me poor,

01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:12.729
and being poor
had kept me from Gilbert.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.264
The money I'd wasted

01:12:14.265 --> 01:12:18.629
could have bought a dozen plane
tickets to see him, Sylvia.

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:21.329
Now, he was dead.

01:12:29.698 --> 01:12:31.428
Gracie.

01:12:35.193 --> 01:12:36.527
Got your lunch.

01:12:38.162 --> 01:12:40.824
Pinky put me on a strict diet.

01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:44.890
And life became
slightly bearable.

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:48.657
As I slowly emerged
from my darkness,

01:12:48.658 --> 01:12:52.428
I began to notice
how much Pinky had aged.

01:12:54.933 --> 01:12:56.963
I'll never forget
the day I discovered

01:12:56.964 --> 01:12:59.423
she had the beginnings
of dementia,

01:12:59.424 --> 01:13:01.063
when I found her attempting

01:13:01.064 --> 01:13:05.164
what she thought
was a jigsaw of a rooster.

01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:09.329
That was just
a few months ago, Sylvia.

01:13:11.032 --> 01:13:13.994
She was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's,

01:13:13.995 --> 01:13:16.455
and went downhill quickly.

01:13:16.456 --> 01:13:18.522
Pinky, what are you doing?

01:13:18.523 --> 01:13:21.396
I'm looking for something.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.527
What?

01:13:25.962 --> 01:13:27.626
I don't know.

01:13:28.498 --> 01:13:29.999
Hmm...

01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:34.192
Roles reversed.

01:13:34.193 --> 01:13:37.164
It was my turn to care for her.

01:13:39.459 --> 01:13:43.296
Ah, my medicine.

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:48.459
One day, she decided
not to get out of bed.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:52.056
Did I tell you that thing
I can't remember?

01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:55.992
That thing I was looking for
but don't know what it is?

01:13:55.993 --> 01:13:59.223
Oh, stupid brain.

01:13:59.224 --> 01:14:01.161
Stupid disease.

01:14:01.162 --> 01:14:03.993
What's the name
of that German guy

01:14:03.994 --> 01:14:05.927
whose disease I got?

01:14:05.928 --> 01:14:08.861
Uh... Guggenheimers?

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:11.794
Yeah, Guggenheimers.

01:14:11.795 --> 01:14:13.827
Relax, Pinky.

01:14:13.828 --> 01:14:15.428
It doesn't matter.

01:14:16.499 --> 01:14:18.191
Oh, Gracie.

01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:21.395
Such a marvellous friend.

01:14:50.698 --> 01:14:53.693
Farewell, Pinky.

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:01.662
The potatoes!

01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:08.288
Potatoes?

01:15:08.289 --> 01:15:10.627
Potatoes...

01:15:10.628 --> 01:15:11.960
Pinky...

01:15:11.961 --> 01:15:14.197
Pinky, what do you mean?

01:15:15.465 --> 01:15:17.164
Oh...

01:15:17.994 --> 01:15:20.197
Oh, Pinky.

01:15:50.797 --> 01:15:53.329
Farewell, Pinky.

01:16:17.929 --> 01:16:20.362
Be free, Sylvia.

01:16:42.095 --> 01:16:45.794
Potatoes? Potatoes?

01:16:45.795 --> 01:16:48.494
Sylvia... Ugh.

01:16:48.495 --> 01:16:51.494
Maybe that's what she
wanted her last meal to be?

01:16:54.465 --> 01:16:56.827
Goddamn life!

01:16:56.828 --> 01:16:59.330
Ugh! Goddamn life.

01:16:59.331 --> 01:17:00.829
Such a...

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:04.429
Such a stupid, stupid puzzle!

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:06.089
Damn it!

01:17:10.127 --> 01:17:11.960
I'm so alone.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.626
So... So alone.

01:17:26.495 --> 01:17:29.027
Rabbit face, rabbit face,

01:17:29.028 --> 01:17:31.157
rabbit face, rabbit face...

01:17:31.158 --> 01:17:32.459
Nice, Gracie.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.195
-Grace Pudel!
-Nice Hairdo!

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:36.861
Come on, you two. Let's go.

01:17:36.862 --> 01:17:38.894
I hate it here.

01:17:38.895 --> 01:17:40.724
I'll be escaping soon,

01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:42.490
and crossing the desert
to come and get to you.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.262
It saddens me to tell you

01:17:44.263 --> 01:17:47.260
that Gilbert has died
in an horrific fire...

01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:49.758
...fire, fire, fire, fire...

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.428
The potatoes!

01:18:12.928 --> 01:18:15.263
The p... The potatoes!

01:18:37.325 --> 01:18:39.197
Dear Grace,

01:18:39.198 --> 01:18:44.160
if you're reading this,
then I'm as dead as a doughnut,

01:18:44.161 --> 01:18:46.996
and you've found my biscuit tin

01:18:46.997 --> 01:18:51.060
and some things
I want you to have.

01:18:51.061 --> 01:18:53.591
You've been asleep for days,

01:18:53.592 --> 01:18:56.928
and I need to tell you
important stuff

01:18:56.929 --> 01:18:59.626
before my brain fully rots.

01:19:01.294 --> 01:19:05.027
Oh, old age is such a bastard.

01:19:05.028 --> 01:19:07.657
Creeps up without you knowing.

01:19:07.658 --> 01:19:11.230
One day, you sink your teeth
into an apple...

01:19:12.863 --> 01:19:14.725
...and they stay.

01:19:16.266 --> 01:19:19.798
You go to straighten
the wrinkles in your pantyhose,

01:19:19.799 --> 01:19:23.429
and then realise
you're not wearing any.

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.959
Oh.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.255
Anyway, I digress.

01:19:28.256 --> 01:19:30.428
My secrets.

01:19:31.128 --> 01:19:33.995
Firstly, I'm an orphan,

01:19:33.996 --> 01:19:36.762
and was raised in an orphanage,

01:19:36.763 --> 01:19:39.356
after the Great War.

01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:41.525
It was a terrible place,

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:45.296
where I was kept in a crib
day and night.

01:19:46.029 --> 01:19:49.058
Never held or hugged.

01:19:49.059 --> 01:19:51.159
The only contact,

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.261
the little boy next to me.

01:19:54.262 --> 01:19:59.191
No, I won't tell you
the horrors I remember,

01:19:59.192 --> 01:20:00.623
but do want to tell you

01:20:00.624 --> 01:20:04.594
what it's like
to feel imprisoned,

01:20:04.595 --> 01:20:06.389
caged.

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:09.795
It was simply dreadful.

01:20:09.796 --> 01:20:12.556
But, in the years since,

01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:16.491
I've learnt that
the worst cages

01:20:16.492 --> 01:20:21.361
are the ones we create
for ourselves.

01:20:21.362 --> 01:20:25.659
You have created a cage
for yourself, Gracie.

01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:30.590
Your cage
has never been locked...

01:20:30.591 --> 01:20:33.824
...but your fears
have kept you trapped.

01:20:37.392 --> 01:20:40.461
Get rid of those snails!

01:20:41.259 --> 01:20:44.226
Set yourself free.

01:20:44.227 --> 01:20:47.327
You got rid of that creepy ken.

01:20:47.328 --> 01:20:51.794
Now it's time for you
to shed your shell.

01:20:51.795 --> 01:20:53.923
Purge your hoard.

01:20:55.796 --> 01:20:57.494
Start anew.

01:20:58.326 --> 01:21:02.059
A bit of self-pity's OK,

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.395
but it's time to move on.

01:21:05.434 --> 01:21:07.793
There'll be pain,

01:21:07.794 --> 01:21:10.060
but that's life.

01:21:10.061 --> 01:21:13.155
You have to face it head-on.

01:21:13.156 --> 01:21:15.065
Be brave.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.894
Anyway, I want to
thank you, Gracie.

01:22:08.895 --> 01:22:11.260
You've been terrific.

01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:15.731
Not long now
till my number's up.

01:22:15.732 --> 01:22:19.225
It's time to close my curtains.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:21.960
For the first time in my life,

01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:25.126
I feel older than I look.

01:22:25.127 --> 01:22:27.659
And I look like a testicle.

01:22:28.766 --> 01:22:31.159
Life's a beautiful tapestry

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.357
that needs to be experienced.

01:22:35.358 --> 01:22:39.326
It's small pleasures savoured,

01:22:39.327 --> 01:22:44.164
like smoking a cigar
in the rain.

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:50.725
Or wearing a jumper
straight from the dryer.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.357
Enough rambling.

01:22:53.358 --> 01:22:58.091
Time for both of us to let go.

01:22:58.092 --> 01:23:00.228
Like I've said,

01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:04.698
life can only be understood
backwards,

01:23:04.699 --> 01:23:08.997
but we have to
live it forwards.

01:23:08.998 --> 01:23:13.059
Snails never go back
over their trails,

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.164
always moving forwards.

01:23:16.165 --> 01:23:20.224
Time for you to leave
some glittering snail trails

01:23:20.225 --> 01:23:22.428
all over the world.

01:23:23.534 --> 01:23:25.826
And remember, never...

01:23:25.827 --> 01:23:28.626
never go back.

01:23:35.527 --> 01:23:39.591
All rise.
Order in the court.

01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:43.992
Miss Pudel,
your crime is serious.

01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:45.360
Theft is theft,

01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:48.627
whether it be a diamond
or a cucumber.

01:23:48.628 --> 01:23:50.897
And if you forgive the fox
for stealing your chickens,

01:23:50.898 --> 01:23:53.428
well, then,
he'll steal your sheep.

01:23:56.225 --> 01:23:57.857
However...

01:23:59.062 --> 01:24:00.524
I can tell from your face

01:24:00.525 --> 01:24:03.098
that you are full of
shame and regret.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.357
And true regret
is punishment enough.

01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:10.197
I know you are a kind person.

01:24:10.198 --> 01:24:13.357
As, many years ago, a little
girl showed me kindness

01:24:13.358 --> 01:24:15.924
when I was at my lowest ebb.

01:24:15.925 --> 01:24:17.696
Ah! Ah...

01:24:17.697 --> 01:24:19.390
Ah.

01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:21.892
Good on ya, little possum.

01:24:21.893 --> 01:24:23.063
Good on ya.

01:24:23.064 --> 01:24:25.358
That little girl gave me hope
and courage

01:24:25.359 --> 01:24:27.796
to start again,
and escape my...

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:30.198
...my vices.

01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:31.426
Oh!

01:24:31.427 --> 01:24:34.458
You may have light fingers,
Miss Pudel,

01:24:34.459 --> 01:24:36.796
but I know you have
a heart of gold,

01:24:36.797 --> 01:24:39.492
and have done many good deeds.

01:24:39.493 --> 01:24:44.322
I therefore release you
from your charges.

01:24:44.323 --> 01:24:46.696
Case dismissed.

01:24:46.697 --> 01:24:49.032
Ah!

01:25:08.527 --> 01:25:11.664
Life had bashed me
round a bit,

01:25:11.665 --> 01:25:15.023
but the roses smelt better.

01:25:15.024 --> 01:25:19.725
And I finally started to become
the person I'd always wanted.

01:25:21.865 --> 01:25:23.761
I made a film about my life.

01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:45.758
It wasn't very good.

01:25:46.567 --> 01:25:48.692
But a few people came.

01:25:48.693 --> 01:25:51.795
I even had a question
and answer session afterwards.

01:25:51.796 --> 01:25:55.024
Any... Any questions?

01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:59.188
Mm-mm.

01:25:59.189 --> 01:26:01.296
Mmm...

01:26:04.298 --> 01:26:06.256
Oh, well.

01:26:06.257 --> 01:26:08.131
Thanks for coming.

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.164
Yes.

01:26:13.094 --> 01:26:14.659
I've got one.

01:26:17.633 --> 01:26:21.362
Do you believe in magic?

01:26:33.663 --> 01:26:35.398
Gilbert?

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:38.857
Yes, it's me.

01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:42.890
I... I walked across
that desert.

01:27:42.927 --> 01:27:46.065
It took me a while
to believe Gilbert was alive...

01:27:53.492 --> 01:27:55.461
...how he'd
escaped the fire...

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:02.726
...and how his ashes
were nothing more than...

01:28:02.727 --> 01:28:04.362
ashes.

01:28:05.734 --> 01:28:09.263
His urn
now found a new purpose.

01:28:12.459 --> 01:28:15.928
The cycle of life continued.

01:28:15.929 --> 01:28:19.329
And your job was done, Sylvia.

01:28:21.066 --> 01:28:25.230
We were all
finally free of our cages.

01:28:29.365 --> 01:28:32.824
And even though our family
had shrunk a little...

01:28:34.865 --> 01:28:37.197
...we were together again...

01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:47.329
...with only one thing
left to release.

01:28:55.099 --> 01:28:58.296
Gilbert still smelt
like burnt matches.

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:03.530
The setting sun
tingled our skin,

01:29:03.531 --> 01:29:05.560
our two souls...

01:29:06.864 --> 01:29:09.527
...and our single heart.
