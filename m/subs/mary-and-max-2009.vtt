02:43.208 --> 02:46.999
Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour
of muddy puddles.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.540
Her birthmark, the colour of poo.

02:53.625 --> 02:57.374
(Dogs whimper)

03:01.500 --> 03:03.749
(Dogs bark)

03:03.833 --> 03:08.374
lt was Saturday afternoon
and she was bored.

03:08.375 --> 03:12.540
Mary wished she had a friend
to play piggybacks with.

03:15.041 --> 03:17.999
(Dogs whimper)

03:19.791 --> 03:22.415
(Birdsong)

03:24.958 --> 03:29.624
Mary's mood ring, which she'd found
in a cereal box, was grey

03:29.708 --> 03:31.999
which, according to the chart,

03:32.000 --> 03:39.207
meant she was either pensive,
unconsciously ambitious or hungry.

03:39.250 --> 03:43.374
Her only friends were 'The Noblets'
from her favourite cartoon.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.832
They weren't the real ones
you bought in the shops

03:46.833 --> 03:51.249
but fake ones she had to make herself
from shells, gumnuts, pompoms

03:51.250 --> 03:56.374
and the chicken bones salvaged
from Friday night's takeaway.

03:56.375 --> 04:00.540
She had to make all her own toys,
and her favourites were Shrinkies -

04:00.541 --> 04:04.915
potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.749
(Machine squeaks and squelches)

04:08.791 --> 04:12.082
Mary's father, Noel Norman Dinkle,

04:12.083 --> 04:15.499
worked in a factory,
attaching the strings to tea bags.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.124
(Conveyor squeaks)

04:17.125 --> 04:19.540
At show and tell, she told the class

04:19.541 --> 04:24.874
he could get as many free tea bags
as he wanted.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.790
Her favourite tea bag was Earl Grey.

04:28.791 --> 04:33.124
She loved saying 'Earl Grey'

04:33.125 --> 04:38.499
and would like one day to marry
someone called Earl Grey.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.124
(Bagpipes play 'Scotland The Brave')

04:40.166 --> 04:42.124
They would live
in a castle in Scotland,

04:42.208 --> 04:44.790
have 9 babies, 2 ducks...
(Ducks quack)

04:44.791 --> 04:46.665
..and a dog called Kevin.

04:46.666 --> 04:49.165
(Dog whimpers)

04:49.166 --> 04:52.999
Noel's hobby was to sit in his shed
and drink Baileys lrish Cream

04:53.000 --> 04:58.249
and stuff birds he'd found
on the side of the freeway.

04:58.250 --> 05:05.124
Mary wished he'd spend more time
with her and less with his dead friends.

05:05.125 --> 05:08.957
She also wished she had
some brothers and sisters.

05:08.958 --> 05:12.540
Her mother had told her
she was 'an accident'.

05:12.583 --> 05:16.540
How could someone be an accident?

05:16.541 --> 05:20.749
Grandpoppy Ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate

05:20.750 --> 05:24.249
and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer.

05:26.250 --> 05:29.540
Grandpoppy Ralph
had smelt like pickled onions

05:29.541 --> 05:34.832
and had been a member
of the Frankston lce Breakers for 51 years.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.957
Aaagh! Aaaaaghhh!
(Water splashes)

05:36.958 --> 05:40.249
They swam in winter to feel alive.

05:40.250 --> 05:46.540
Grandpoppy Ralph had said
it made his nipples erect.

05:46.541 --> 05:49.249
He had died the year before, aged 74,

05:49.250 --> 05:54.790
and his best mate, Ken,
had recited a poem in his honour.

05:54.791 --> 05:58.290
(Ken): Born in a barn
in the hills of Boronia,

05:58.291 --> 06:00.124
Ralph lived a long life,

06:00.125 --> 06:03.790
then died of pneumonia.

06:03.791 --> 06:04.790
Mary missed him

06:04.833 --> 06:09.540
and often wondered
why he had drunk ammonia.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.540
A lot of things puzzled Mary

06:12.541 --> 06:16.957
especially her mother,
Vera Lorraine Dinkle.

06:17.791 --> 06:22.082
To Mary, Vera always seemed wobbly.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.082
(Radio) : A pretty vicious ball.
And he's out!

06:25.333 --> 06:29.332
Vera liked listening to the cricket
while baking

06:29.416 --> 06:33.540
and her main ingredient
was always sherry.

06:33.541 --> 06:36.749
(Radio) : 3/44. And Thompson 2/1 5...

06:36.750 --> 06:39.749
She told Mary it was a type of tea
for grown-ups

06:39.750 --> 06:42.749
that needed constant testing.

06:42.750 --> 06:46.624
(Radio) : Just out of the reach
of the lead. 6/96 England.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.665
(Door slams)

06:49.000 --> 06:50.999
(Dishwasher starts)

06:51.583 --> 06:56.249
Mary thought her mother tested
the sherry...(she farts)...way too much.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.707
(Snores)

06:58.791 --> 07:04.540
Mary also couldn't understand
why Vera was always 'borrowing'.

07:04.541 --> 07:09.665
Yesterday, she borrowed
some fish fingers from Aisle 6.

07:09.666 --> 07:13.957
She told Mary she put things
up her dress to save on plastic bags.

07:16.916 --> 07:21.415
Vera was indeed a complicated soul.

07:22.666 --> 07:25.665
(Thunder, rain pattering)

07:31.791 --> 07:33.707
(Knock at door)
(Mary): Oooh!

07:33.875 --> 07:35.207
Mary stopped daydreaming

07:35.250 --> 07:38.082
and went and fetched
her pet rooster from the rain.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.249
(Door squeaks)

07:41.166 --> 07:44.582
Her father had found the rooster
on the side of the freeway

07:44.583 --> 07:48.790
after it had fallen off the back
of a slaughter truck.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.915
She named him Ethel.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.624
(TV plays 'The Noblets' theme music )

07:54.750 --> 07:59.082
lt was time to watch 'The Noblets'.
She adored 'The Noblets'

07:59.166 --> 08:03.165
because everyone was brown,
lived in a teapot

08:03.208 --> 08:06.957
and had oodles of friends.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.832
There was nothing nicer,
Mary thought to herself,

08:09.833 --> 08:12.540
than the smell of a wet rooster...
(She sniffs)

08:12.541 --> 08:14.415
..the sound of rain on the roof

08:14.458 --> 08:18.915
and the taste of sweetened
condensed milk straight from the can

08:18.916 --> 08:23.207
while watching your favourite cartoon.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.915
(She swallows)

08:29.000 --> 08:32.664

09:05.666 --> 09:08.332
(TV plays 'The Noblets' theme music)

09:08.375 --> 09:13.124
Meanwhile, a man called Max Horowitz
also watched 'The Noblets' .

09:16.000 --> 09:20.457
Max's small television
had picture but no sound.

09:20.458 --> 09:25.165
His big television, sound but no picture.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.582
He was 44 and liked 'The Noblets'

09:27.583 --> 09:31.457
as they lived in a delineated
and articulated social structure

09:31.458 --> 09:34.832
with constant adherent conformity

09:34.833 --> 09:38.790
and also because they had
oodles of friends.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.915
Max had trouble sleeping

09:42.958 --> 09:49.249
and had spent the night watching television
and catching fish food.

09:49.291 --> 09:53.957
He noted to himself it was the sixth fly
he'd caught this evening.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.124
(Clock chimes)

09:58.166 --> 10:01.707
He wondered if he should go to bed
and count sheep

10:01.708 --> 10:05.499
or have one more chocolate hotdog.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.957
He thought he'd try both
but it didn't work.

10:09.958 --> 10:16.457
lt had been 6 hours and 1 2 minutes
since Henry Vlll had passed away.

10:16.458 --> 10:19.874
And Henry's death
had thrown Max's life into disarray.

(Mournful Russian folk music)

10:21.000 --> 10:22.999
(Mournful Russian folk music)
lt had become asymmetrical

10:23.000 --> 10:26.749
and the sooner
he got a new fish, the better.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.624
(Toilet flushes)

10:29.666 --> 10:33.582
Tomorrow he would go to the pet store
and get another Henry -

10:33.583 --> 10:35.499
Henry lX.

10:37.458 --> 10:39.332

10:51.791 --> 10:54.665
(Man): Next.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.082
lt was shopping day

10:56.083 --> 11:03.207
and Mary sat patiently while her mother
(erm...) 'borrowed' some envelopes.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.999
To fill in time, she scanned the room

11:06.000 --> 11:08.999
and counted how many things
were brown.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.457
There was sticky tape, rubber bands

11:11.458 --> 11:16.040
and a phone book with a picture
of a lady standing in a brown lake

11:16.041 --> 11:18.207
with her hand on fire.

11:19.291 --> 11:25.040
People had weird names in America,
Mary Daisy Dinkle thought to herself.

11:25.041 --> 11:29.999
Funny-sounding people
called Rockefeller and Finkelstein.

11:30.041 --> 11:33.415
She wondered what they looked like,
how old they were

11:33.416 --> 11:39.332
and if they were married, wore glasses
or had found babies in their beer.

11:39.375 --> 11:42.624
(Baby gurgles) Maybe in the USA
they found babies elsewhere.

11:42.625 --> 11:45.332
(Mary): Hmm...
They drank a lot of cola.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.874
Maybe they found them in cans.
(Baby gurgles)

11:48.875 --> 11:51.707
But, no, they wouldn't fit
through the hole.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.124
(Disappointed gurgle)

11:53.125 --> 11:56.249
(Lightbulb tings)
Mary had an idea.

11:56.250 --> 12:02.374
She would write to one of the Americans
and ask where babies came from.

12:02.416 --> 12:06.332
She chose a Mr M Horowitz.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.874
(She inhales, then coughs)

12:10.875 --> 12:13.999
(Tense, dramatic orchestra)

12:15.000 --> 12:18.374
(Postmaster) : Aarrgh. Mrs Dinkle!

12:18.375 --> 12:22.915
Come back here, Vera Dinkle!
You come back here!

12:23.375 --> 12:24.665
Aaarghhhh!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.915
(Mary): Dear Mr M Horowitz,

12:28.916 --> 12:32.957
my name is Mary Daisy Dinkle

12:32.958 --> 12:38.957
and l am 8 years old,
3 months and 9 days.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.582
My favourite colour is brown

12:41.583 --> 12:45.665
and my favourite food
is sweetened condensed milk

12:45.666 --> 12:49.332
followed closely by chocolate.

12:49.333 --> 12:54.332
l have a rooster called Ethel
that looks like this.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.124
He doesn't lay eggs but will one day.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.582
(Pop!)

12:58.625 --> 13:02.082
My mother likes smoking,
cricket and sherry

13:02.083 --> 13:07.624
and my father likes playing in his shed
with dead birds.

13:07.708 --> 13:10.457
Where do babies come from
in America?

13:10.458 --> 13:12.582
Do they come from cola cans?

13:12.583 --> 13:17.165
ln Australia
they are found in beer glasses.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.790
Here is a drawing of me.

13:18.791 --> 13:22.165
l can't draw ears proper
but l'm good at teeth.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.707
lt would be great if you could write back
and be my friend.

13:27.708 --> 13:31.749
Yours 'sincerealy', Mary Daisy Dinkle.

13:32.833 --> 13:38.165
PS. l hope you like the chocolate bar
l'm also sending.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.957
lt's called a Cherry Ripe.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.874
(Dogs bark and rooster crows)

13:52.833 --> 13:54.832
(She strains)

13:54.875 --> 13:57.374
Goodbye, letter. Don't forget to write.

14:00.250 --> 14:03.749
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

14:11.333 --> 14:13.707
(Max wheezes)

14:22.875 --> 14:24.624
(Lift bell dings)

14:29.750 --> 14:32.040
(Narrator): Max hated Thursdays -

14:32.041 --> 14:36.124
the day of his weekly
Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.665
And tonight he'd felt
especially unsettled

14:39.666 --> 14:44.290
because he'd eaten two chocolate
hotdogs on his way there.

14:44.291 --> 14:45.540
(Teacher) : OK, class...

14:45.541 --> 14:49.124
Eating chocolate was breaking the rules.

14:49.166 --> 14:52.124
He'd found the night
even more unbearable

14:52.125 --> 14:55.040
because of Marjorie Butterworth's
strange glances.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.749
(Teacher) : Class dismissed.

14:56.791 --> 15:02.540
Max had trouble understanding
non-verbal signals.

15:02.541 --> 15:06.374
Flirting was as foreign to him
as jogging.

15:06.958 --> 15:09.124
(Lift bell dings repeatedly)

15:11.958 --> 15:15.790
Max found most people very confusing.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.749
But little did Max realise

15:18.750 --> 15:23.374
his night was about to become
even more confusing and cryptic.

15:25.833 --> 15:28.374
(Max) : Hmm.

15:30.875 --> 15:38.749
He read Mary's letter four times
and then did what he normally did

15:38.791 --> 15:42.374
whenever confronted
with something new and stressful.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.374
(Mutters anxiously)

15:47.458 --> 15:50.457
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

15:52.875 --> 15:59.499
Max's fragile existence
had once again become unsettled.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.415
And after staring out of the window
for 1 8 hours

16:03.416 --> 16:05.582
he finally made a decision.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.582
(Takes a deep breath)

16:12.833 --> 16:16.832
('Typewriter music' plays quickly
in time with Max's typing)

16:27.500 --> 16:30.249
(Max): Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

16:30.250 --> 16:34.624
thank you for the letter,
which l opened and read at 9.1 7pm

16:34.625 --> 16:39.624
after my Overeaters Anonymous class.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.540
l am trying to lose weight

16:41.541 --> 16:44.957
because my psychiatrist,
Dr Bernard Hazelhof,

16:44.958 --> 16:48.624
says a healthy body
equals a healthy mind.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.749
Ooooh!

16:50.750 --> 16:54.749
He says my mind is not that healthy.

16:54.791 --> 17:00.290
Your drawing is an interesting
visual portrayal of yourself.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.332
l have never met anyone from Australia.

17:03.333 --> 17:06.415
Firstly, l will answer your question.

17:09.333 --> 17:14.624
Unfortunately, in America,
babies are not found in cola cans.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.457
l asked my mother when l was four

17:17.458 --> 17:22.874
and she said they came from eggs
laid by rabbis.

17:22.915 --> 17:26.415
lf you aren't Jewish,
they're laid by Catholic nuns.

17:26.415 --> 17:31.415
lf you're an atheist,
they're laid by dirty, lonely prostitutes.

17:31.416 --> 17:35.415
So this is where babies come from
in America.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.832
l share my home with a fish,

17:37.833 --> 17:43.665
some snails, whom l have named
after famous scientists...

17:43.666 --> 17:48.290
(Bird squawks)
..a parakeet called Mr Biscuit

17:48.333 --> 17:51.207
and, finally, a cat called Hal.

17:51.208 --> 17:57.915
'Hal' is an abbreviation for halitosis,
from which he suffers.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.457
He followed me home
after a gang of children

18:00.458 --> 18:02.582
shot his eye out with a beebee gun.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.832
(Miaows meekly)

18:03.833 --> 18:06.582
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

18:06.583 --> 18:10.790
When l was born, my father
left my mother and me on a kibbutz.

18:10.791 --> 18:14.207
She shot herself with my uncle's gun
when l was six.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.207
(Gunshot)

18:16.208 --> 18:18.040
Do you like chocolate hotdogs?

18:18.083 --> 18:23.207
l invented the recipe for them
and can send it to you.

18:23.208 --> 18:29.624
When l was young, l invented
an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.832
My psychiatrist says
l don't need him anymore

18:32.833 --> 18:36.665
so he just sits in the corner and reads.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.874
(Traffic noise)

18:40.875 --> 18:46.832
Last week l picked up
1 28 cigarette butts.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.957
People are always littering in New York.

18:49.958 --> 18:54.707
l do not understand
why people break laws.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.957
Butts are bad
because they wash out to sea

18:57.958 --> 19:03.290
and fish smoke them
and become nicotine dependent.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.874
l am just joking because, of course,

19:06.875 --> 19:11.915
it is impossible for a cigarette
to remain lit underwater.

19:11.916 --> 19:16.624
Also, fish do not have pockets
to keep cigarette lighters in.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.540
(Max farts)

19:21.583 --> 19:23.790
l am 44 years old

19:23.791 --> 19:27.457
and have 8 tracksuits
the same colour and size.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.790
(Scales rattle)

19:30.791 --> 19:33.207
l weigh 352 lb...

19:33.208 --> 19:35.290
Ooooh!

19:35.291 --> 19:37.957
..and am as tall as a 6-foot tree.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.540
(TV): Welcome to the New York Lottery!

19:40.541 --> 19:42.290
l enjoy entering the lottery

19:42.333 --> 19:46.082
and have chosen the same numbers
for 9 years.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.165
Those numbers are 3...
(TV): 1 .

19:49.166 --> 19:51.249
5...
(TV): 4.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.290
6...
(TV): 25.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.957
9...
(TV): 2.

19:54.958 --> 19:56.499
1 1 ...
(TV): 7.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.790
And 1 2.
(TV): 8.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.915
(Applause on TV, Max sighs)

20:00.958 --> 20:03.165
Are you a winner?

20:03.166 --> 20:04.957
Or a loser?

20:04.958 --> 20:08.290
l have had many different jobs
during my life.

20:08.291 --> 20:14.290
My first job was collecting
subway tokens in the subway.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.790
My second job was at Yiddel's
Gourmet Kosher Supplies

20:17.791 --> 20:22.540
where l worked at the machine
that made pre-packaged noodle kugels.

20:22.541 --> 20:26.290
l was born Jewish
and used to believe in God

20:26.291 --> 20:27.957
but l've since read many books

20:27.958 --> 20:32.540
that have proven God
is just a figment of my imagination.

20:32.541 --> 20:36.457
People like to believe in God because
it answers complicated questions

20:36.458 --> 20:40.040
like where did the universe come from,

20:40.041 --> 20:41.290
do worms go to heaven...

20:41.291 --> 20:42.874
do worms go to heaven...
(Squish)

20:42.875 --> 20:46.040
..and why do old ladies have blue hair?

20:46.083 --> 20:47.957
Even though l'm an atheist,

20:47.958 --> 20:52.499
l still wear my yarmulke
as it keeps my brain warm.

20:52.500 --> 20:58.957
My third job was for a company
that printed logos on novelty items.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.374
l worked at the frisbee printing machine.
(Machine creaks and squelches)

21:02.458 --> 21:07.957
A frisbee is a circular plastic disc
that people throw at each other.

21:07.958 --> 21:09.790
lt is like a boomerang

21:10.541 --> 21:13.832
but it does not come back.

21:14.958 --> 21:18.874
My fourth job was when
l was called up for jury duty.

21:18.875 --> 21:24.540
l didn't get paid much
but got free cookies and coffee.

21:24.541 --> 21:28.165
Jurors are outstanding members
of the community

21:28.208 --> 21:31.040
who haven't murdered anybody.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.749
l made it to the short list

21:32.750 --> 21:36.290
for a trial where a man
killed all his friends

21:36.333 --> 21:39.415
at his own surprise birthday party.

21:39.416 --> 21:43.249
Unfortunately, l didn't get selected
because they found out

21:43.250 --> 21:45.790
l'd been a mental patient at one point.

21:45.791 --> 21:47.040
(Pop!)

21:47.041 --> 21:49.790
Have you ever been hang gliding?

21:49.791 --> 21:53.457
My fifth job was as a garbage collector.

21:53.458 --> 21:58.290
l got to clean up after litterbugs
and didn't have to talk to anybody.

21:58.291 --> 22:02.040
Sometimes l used to pretend
l was an intergalactical robot.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.124
(Makes robotic sounds)

22:13.500 --> 22:16.290
(Operator): This is 91 1 .
¤our call has been placed in a queue.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.457
One time the police took me in
for questioning

22:19.458 --> 22:23.165
but let me go when they decided
l wasn't a threat to anybody

22:23.166 --> 22:25.249
except myself.

22:25.250 --> 22:27.499
(Loud military brass band)

22:27.500 --> 22:33.290
The sixth job l had
was for the United States Army

22:33.291 --> 22:36.957
in the stationery supply department. (Sighs)

22:37.000 --> 22:38.957
Because l am good with numbers

22:38.958 --> 22:43.290
l had to work out how many
ballpoint pens the Army needed.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.582
One day they did a security check

22:45.583 --> 22:49.540
and asked whether l was a member
of any radical groups.

22:49.541 --> 22:53.999
l told them l was a member of
the New York Science Fiction Fan Club.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.082
They said this didn't count
but dismissed me anyway.

22:59.083 --> 23:04.540
Fortunately, l did not remember
to tell them l was once a communist.

23:04.541 --> 23:07.040
Have you ever been a communist?

23:07.875 --> 23:12.415
Have you ever been attacked by a crow
or similar large bird?

23:12.416 --> 23:15.290
When l was 9, a crow attacked me
on my way to school.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.749
(Max gasps, crow caws)

23:20.541 --> 23:24.040
l had to have three stitches

23:24.041 --> 23:28.374
and in spring l now wear a helmet
with eyes l have painted on.

23:28.416 --> 23:31.332
People laugh at me
when l wear my helmet.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.665
(Man laughs)
l'm not sure why.

23:33.666 --> 23:38.457
People often confuse me
but l try not to let them worry me.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.957
(Traffic noise)

23:41.041 --> 23:44.457
New York is a very busy
and noisy place.

23:44.458 --> 23:47.040
l would prefer to live
somewhere much quieter

23:47.041 --> 23:49.499
like the moon.

23:49.541 --> 23:55.749
l don't like crowds, bright lights,
sudden noises or strong smells.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.582
New York has all these

23:58.583 --> 24:00.374
especially the smells.

24:00.375 --> 24:01.665
(Max inhales)

24:01.666 --> 24:05.332
l often wear nose and ear plugs
when l go outside.

24:05.333 --> 24:08.665
lt helps keep me calm.

24:08.666 --> 24:14.374
l find humans interesting
but l have trouble understanding them.

24:14.416 --> 24:19.499
l think, however,
l will understand and trust you.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.874
You appear very happy and l think
you would smell like a shrimp

24:25.875 --> 24:29.290
as l know Australia
has a lot of shrimps.

24:31.333 --> 24:33.082
Can you speed-read?

24:33.125 --> 24:36.499
l have taught myself to read
two pages at once -

24:36.500 --> 24:39.790
one eyeball per page.

24:39.791 --> 24:41.124
l have to go now

24:41.125 --> 24:44.207
even though l have not told you
about my 7th job,

24:44.208 --> 24:47.082
in a condom factory.

24:47.125 --> 24:48.832
Write back soon.

24:48.833 --> 24:55.540
Your American friend,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

24:55.541 --> 25:00.499
PS. Please find enclosed
a photo from one of those booths.

25:00.500 --> 25:04.457
PPS. Thank you for the Cherry Ripe

25:04.458 --> 25:07.999
and l am glad you like chocolate
as much as l do.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.957
l have never eaten
sweetened condensed milk

25:10.958 --> 25:14.207
but l will try some this week.

25:14.208 --> 25:18.999
PPPS. l have never used a condom.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.124
Gey gezunterheyt.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.749
(Narrator): Max hoped
Mary would write again.

25:26.750 --> 25:29.790
He'd always wanted a friend.

25:29.791 --> 25:36.749
A friend that wasn't invisible,
a pet or rubber figurine.

25:36.750 --> 25:41.749
He counted the stars and wondered
how many days, hours, minutes

25:41.750 --> 25:46.457
it would take his letter
to reach Australia.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.249
(Frantic orchestral music)

25:51.250 --> 25:53.665
Vera was not impressed...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.749
Aaaarrgh!

25:57.750 --> 26:01.207
..not impressed at all.

26:01.208 --> 26:07.207
This nutcase would not be
her daughter's penfriend, she thought.

26:07.250 --> 26:10.207
There was enough ugliness in the world.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.957
Mary would be home from school
in an hour -

26:12.958 --> 26:17.915
enough time for another cup of tea
and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves

26:17.916 --> 26:22.332
and dissolve the memory of Max's letter
from her pickled mind.

26:22.375 --> 26:27.124
(Radio) : Yeah, he's out.
Unbelievable. 1 4. England 7/1 50.

26:29.958 --> 26:33.082
(Truck whines and rumbles)

26:45.458 --> 26:49.374
(Dark, menacing music)

26:58.000 --> 27:01.249
(Vera shouts) : Stop! Wait!

27:01.250 --> 27:06.249
Hey. fellas, you got room
for one more bag?

27:06.250 --> 27:09.999
Sure, Mrs Dinkle. Hop in! (Laughs)

27:10.000 --> 27:12.124
(Garbage man 2) : Good one. Kevin!

27:12.625 --> 27:14.999
Aaaarghhh!

27:15.000 --> 27:17.457
(Thud! Men laugh)

27:19.458 --> 27:22.707
(Garbage man): Come on, Vera.
We've got some other bags to pick up!

27:27.250 --> 27:29.915
(Rippling piano and strings)

27:29.916 --> 27:33.499
Ooh. Hmm.

27:37.958 --> 27:40.374
Mary, is that all the rubbish?

27:40.375 --> 27:42.374
Yep!

27:42.375 --> 27:45.040
(Garbage man): See ya, Toots!

27:45.041 --> 27:47.457
(Vera): Sweet baby Jesus.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.749
(Thud!) Ooooah!

27:59.750 --> 28:01.624
(Rippling piano and strings)

28:01.625 --> 28:06.749
Even though Max's letter smelt
like fish heads and orange peel,

28:06.833 --> 28:10.957
Mary drank his words
like a bowl of alphabet soup

28:10.958 --> 28:13.249
and hadn't been this excited

28:13.250 --> 28:18.707
since Grandpoppy Ralph
had found a coin up her nose.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.374
She wrote back immediately

28:20.375 --> 28:24.957
on some butchers' paper
she'd stolen from some chops.

28:24.958 --> 28:29.082
(Mary): Dear Max,
l'm so excited you've wroted back.

28:29.083 --> 28:33.124
l don't think my parents like you
so from now on

28:33.125 --> 28:36.415
send stuff to my neighbour Len Hislop

28:36.416 --> 28:41.582
at 26 Lamington Drive,
Mt Waverley.

28:41.666 --> 28:44.582
He's old with no legs.

28:44.583 --> 28:47.374
They got chew'd'ed off
in World War ll

28:47.375 --> 28:51.332
when some Japanese peoples
kept him in a cage above piranhas.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.332
(Screams)

28:53.333 --> 28:56.749
Piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.

28:58.458 --> 29:03.832
He's scared of outside,
which is a disease called homophobia.

29:03.833 --> 29:06.249
(Magpie warbles, Len gasps)

29:06.250 --> 29:09.874
He's started giving me 50 cents a week
to get his mail.

29:09.875 --> 29:10.999
(Bagpipes play 'Scotland The Brave')

29:11.041 --> 29:17.957
l'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland
and marry a man called Earl Grey.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.499
Do you get 'The Noblets' in America?

29:20.500 --> 29:24.499
Well, my favourite Noblet
is Vanity Noblet.

29:24.500 --> 29:30.374
He wants to be everyone's friend,
even the boys'!

29:30.375 --> 29:34.040
ln your letter, you said
you had no friends. (Munching)

29:34.083 --> 29:36.415
Well, neither do l.

29:36.416 --> 29:39.165
A-ha!

29:39.208 --> 29:43.207
Yesterday at school, Bernie Clifford
weed on my spam sandwich

29:43.291 --> 29:47.457
and called me 'poo face'
'cos of my birthmark.

29:47.458 --> 29:50.624
l wish l could peel it off like a bandaid.

29:50.625 --> 29:53.957
He also laughed
'cos l had no buttons.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.124
Ethel pecked them off

29:56.125 --> 30:00.707
and Mum couldn't thread a needle
'cos she'd been testing the sherry

30:00.708 --> 30:02.207
so she used pegs instead.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.499
(Lonely cello solo)

30:05.500 --> 30:12.082
When l got home, l climbed into
my secret place till dinner time.

30:12.125 --> 30:14.957
The other kids also laugh at my haircut.

30:14.958 --> 30:17.749
Dad has to cut my hair
because mum says

30:17.750 --> 30:20.874
real hairdressers
sell your hair to Chinamen

30:20.875 --> 30:22.457
who stuff mattresses.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.957
(Shears chomp)

30:24.958 --> 30:28.957
My teacher, Mrs Pendergast,
says l should smile more.

30:28.958 --> 30:33.957
l told my mum
and so she drawed a big smile on me.

30:36.958 --> 30:39.957
l don't think Mrs Pendergast
likes me anymore.

30:39.958 --> 30:42.582
(Mary groans, children laugh)

30:42.583 --> 30:45.499
(Lonely cello and piano)

30:45.500 --> 30:50.332
l better go now.
My tears are smudgling my words.

30:50.333 --> 30:55.957
Your friend in Australia,
Mary Daisy Dinkle. (Sniffs)

30:55.958 --> 31:03.207
PS. Have you ever been teased?
Can you help me?

31:03.208 --> 31:09.749
PSS. l've never been hang gliding
before or been a 'commune-ist'

31:09.750 --> 31:14.957
but would love a frisbee
and your recipe for chocolate hotdogs.

31:14.958 --> 31:22.124
PSSS. l'm sending you some
Australian chocolate, a pompom l made

31:22.125 --> 31:26.707
and a cake called a lamington,
which l was meant to eat for lunch.

31:31.708 --> 31:34.707
(Lonely cello and piano)

31:44.958 --> 31:47.457
(Fly buzzes)

31:48.458 --> 31:52.332
(Sad clarinet and orchestra)

31:52.333 --> 31:54.332
(Max): Have you ever been teased?

31:56.208 --> 31:58.582
Ooooooooooaaaahhhh!

31:58.666 --> 32:00.665
(Narrator): Mary's letter
triggered memories

32:00.666 --> 32:04.374
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.

32:04.375 --> 32:08.790
(Bullies): We've got him cornered now.
Hey. Jew-boy, you're gonna pay...

32:09.458 --> 32:14.290
(Punching and groaning)
Take this, Jew-boy, Jew-boy, Jew-boy.

32:15.291 --> 32:16.957
(Max moans)

32:16.958 --> 32:21.207
And as usual,
he coped in the only way he knew.

32:21.708 --> 32:25.082
(Max moans gently)

32:31.208 --> 32:33.790
And 36 chocolate hotdogs later...

32:33.791 --> 32:34.957
(Max burps)

32:35.500 --> 32:39.040
..and after only two hours sleep,

32:39.083 --> 32:46.332
Max's meltdown faded away
and an idea popped into his brain.

32:46.333 --> 32:48.415
(Ting!)

32:48.416 --> 32:51.415
(Max): Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

32:51.416 --> 32:57.374
thank you for your letter, chocolate bar,
lamington and pompom.

32:57.416 --> 33:01.790
The chocolate got crushed, so l blended
the bits with milk and icecream

33:01.833 --> 33:04.499
and now l am drinking it right now.

33:04.958 --> 33:07.499
(Slurps)

33:07.541 --> 33:11.915
After much thought, l think
l have a solution to your teasing.

33:11.916 --> 33:14.082
Tell Bernie Clifford
your birthmark is made of chocolate,

33:16.916 --> 33:19.040
which means when you get to heaven

33:19.041 --> 33:22.707
you will be in charge
of all the chocolate.

33:22.708 --> 33:26.499
This of course is a lie -
l do not like lies -

33:26.500 --> 33:30.415
but in this case
l think it will be of benefit.

33:30.458 --> 33:34.374
l wish l could be in charge
of all the chocolate

33:34.375 --> 33:39.082
but, of course, l cannot
because of my atheism. (Pop!)

33:41.166 --> 33:43.915
My neighbour lvy is also an atheist.
(Water bubbles)

33:43.958 --> 33:50.415
She doesn't talk much but makes me
very good soup on Sunday nights.

33:50.416 --> 33:52.457
She is partly blind

33:52.458 --> 33:57.165
and sometimes l find her hair
in my soup. Eeugh!

33:57.166 --> 34:04.665
l do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof
says this would be (farts) impolite.

34:04.666 --> 34:08.331
Here is a list of what l eat
on the other nights.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.706
Mondays - Glicks Potato Knish,

34:10.708 --> 34:13.831
Tuesdays - Yiddels Noodle Kugel,

34:13.833 --> 34:17.206
Wednesdays -
Captain Salty's Fishstix,

34:17.208 --> 34:19.956
Thursdays - Yentls Cheezy Blintz

34:19.958 --> 34:23.415
and Fridays - chicken nuggets.

34:23.458 --> 34:26.998
On Saturday nights
l create my own recipes.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.540
Last week l invented
canned spaghetti hamburgers.

34:31.541 --> 34:34.956
Recipes are like
mathematical equations.

34:34.958 --> 34:41.915
Dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should
never weigh more than your refrigerator

34:41.916 --> 34:46.831
and to never eat
anything bigger than your head.

34:46.833 --> 34:50.790
l once ate a watermelon
bigger than my head

34:50.875 --> 34:53.831
but not all at once.

34:53.875 --> 34:57.707
Do you have
any weight loss suggestions?

34:57.708 --> 35:00.832
My Overeaters Anonymous meetings
don't seem to be working

35:00.833 --> 35:03.957
and just make me tense.

35:03.958 --> 35:05.999
(Groans anxiously)

35:06.000 --> 35:08.749
(Slurps loudly)

35:10.458 --> 35:13.790
lt would be good
if there was a 'Fat Fairy' .

35:13.791 --> 35:15.540
(Snores)

35:15.583 --> 35:20.249
She would be a bit like the Tooth Fairy
but would suck out your fat.

35:23.958 --> 35:25.165
(Water bubbling)

35:25.166 --> 35:30.999
lvy says she is only a 'little bit' blind
but l think she is very blind.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.874
She should get a cane
like other vision-impaired people.

35:35.791 --> 35:38.374
She could make the end pointy
(Ching!)

35:38.375 --> 35:40.915
and collect rubbish at the same time.

35:42.291 --> 35:46.207
l think l will write a letter to the Mayor
and suggest this.

35:46.208 --> 35:49.915
He will be very impressed.

35:49.916 --> 35:55.249
lvy says she doesn't need a cane
because she has a good sense of smell.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.124
(lvy sniffs)

35:57.125 --> 36:02.415
She says she could find me
with her eyes stapled shut.

36:02.416 --> 36:06.915
She says l smell like liquorice
and old books.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.249
(Crash!)

36:10.875 --> 36:16.374
l think she smells like cough medicine
and urine.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.332
l have never told her this

36:18.333 --> 36:23.832
as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
this would also be impolite.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.790
(Lift bell dings, lift doors clank shut)

36:27.958 --> 36:30.499
People often think
l am tactless and rude.

36:30.916 --> 36:33.832
(Farts)

36:33.833 --> 36:40.165
l cannot understand
how being honest can be...improper.

36:40.208 --> 36:45.957
Maybe this is why
l don't have any friends

36:45.958 --> 36:47.832
of course except for you.

36:48.916 --> 36:52.207
A real friend has been
one of my three goals in life.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.207
(Bubbles pop, satisfied groan)

36:54.208 --> 37:00.624
The other two are to own every Noblet
and a lifetime supply of chocolate.

37:02.708 --> 37:07.207
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
it is good to have goals

37:07.208 --> 37:12.332
but not stupid ones like mine.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.707
l have now run out of things to tell you.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.915
Please, write soon.

37:19.916 --> 37:25.957
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

37:25.958 --> 37:30.374
PS. Do not worry about not smiling.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.957
My mouth hardly ever smiles

37:32.958 --> 37:37.749
but it does not mean
l am not smiling inside my brain.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.749
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

37:39.750 --> 37:44.165
PPS. Please find enclosed a frisbee,

37:44.166 --> 37:47.499
some Chocolate Pop Rocks,
which you should eat with cola,

37:47.500 --> 37:53.540
and an illustration of a turtle
from one of my National Geographics.

37:53.583 --> 37:59.124
PPPS. Did you know that turtles
can breathe through their anuses?

38:01.416 --> 38:03.415
(Quirky strings)

38:03.458 --> 38:05.332
Dear Max,

38:05.333 --> 38:07.374
when l told Bernie Clifford

38:07.375 --> 38:11.290
l'll be in charge of all the chocolate
in heaven and he wouldn't get any,

38:11.291 --> 38:12.749
he cried.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.415
(Wails)

38:14.416 --> 38:19.957
l also hide'd some dog's poo
in his bit of the sandpit.

38:19.958 --> 38:24.249
Your advice was great
and l've got a job delivering pamphlets

38:24.333 --> 38:27.540
so l can save to come and see you.

38:27.541 --> 38:29.665
l am sad to hear you are fat.

38:29.666 --> 38:34.082
Mum says l am fat too
and l'm growing up to be a heifer,

38:34.083 --> 38:37.957
which l think is a type of cow.

38:37.958 --> 38:42.415
Maybe you should only eat things
beginning with the letter of each day.

38:42.458 --> 38:44.957
On Mondays you could only eat

38:44.958 --> 38:50.707
milkshakes, marshmallows
and...mustard.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.332
Oooh!

38:52.333 --> 38:55.957
(High rippling piano, pizzicato strings)

38:55.958 --> 39:00.624
For my birthday, my Mum baked a cake
and Dad gave me a camera.

39:00.625 --> 39:02.207
(Camera clicks)

39:02.291 --> 39:05.249
l hope you like the photos l sent.

39:05.250 --> 39:08.707
The first one is of Ethel,
who ate some tinsel.

39:08.708 --> 39:11.332
The next one is one of myself

39:11.333 --> 39:16.499
after l ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks
with the cola, like you said.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.540
Next is Len.

39:18.541 --> 39:25.040
He's still trying hard not to be afraid of outside
and conquer his homophobia.

39:25.125 --> 39:28.499
(Len screams, dog barks, pole clangs)

39:28.500 --> 39:32.207
The next one is of dad in his shed,

39:32.208 --> 39:35.499
and then one of the times
l covered mum

39:35.500 --> 39:39.624
while she was asleep in her stickers
that help her stop smoking.

39:39.625 --> 39:43.999
Next, when l got my slinky
caught in my hair.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.957
Then one of the times
Sonny digged up his wife, Cher.

39:48.958 --> 39:55.749
And, finally, a photo of my other neighbour
Damian Popodopolous.

39:55.791 --> 39:59.957
He's a Greek and smells like
lemon dishwashing liquid

39:59.958 --> 40:05.374
and his skin is smooth,
like the back of a spoon.

40:05.375 --> 40:11.582
Mum says he's a wog and has a stutter
and can't even say his own surname.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.332
(He stutters)

40:13.333 --> 40:16.874
She says you have to hit him
on the back of the head

40:16.875 --> 40:18.249
to get his words out.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.207
P-P-P-P...Popodopolous.

40:20.250 --> 40:24.582
l wish he was my boyfriend
and we can be in love and do sexing

40:24.583 --> 40:27.457
like Katherine Ramsay told me
behind the bike shed.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.749
She said it's when two people go 'nuddy'

40:30.750 --> 40:33.332
and rub on each other to make babies.
(Squeaking)

40:34.333 --> 40:39.082
l told her she's a liar
and would go to hell and burn like toast

40:39.083 --> 40:41.957
'cos babies really come
from beer glasses

40:41.958 --> 40:46.332
and eggs laid by rabbits
and nuns and 'prosti-tubes'.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.415
She said ladies get knocked up

40:48.416 --> 40:51.582
and bake babies in their stomachs
for 2 years

40:51.583 --> 40:55.374
till they spurt out their 'vag-eye-ners'
with blood and tinned spaghetti.

40:56.583 --> 40:59.832
Have you got a girlfriend, Max,
or some wives?

40:59.833 --> 41:02.332
Have you done sexing?

41:02.333 --> 41:03.749
Valentine's Day is soon

41:03.750 --> 41:08.874
and l want to give Damian a present
so he can love me.

41:08.958 --> 41:12.040
Can you explain love
and how l can be 'lover'd'?

41:12.041 --> 41:14.332
(Max screams)

41:14.333 --> 41:17.957
(Narrator): Once again, Mary's letter
had triggered an anxiety attack.

41:17.958 --> 41:19.415
(Heartbeat)

41:19.416 --> 41:21.582
Max knew nothing about love.

41:21.583 --> 41:25.540
lt was as foreign to him as scuba diving

41:25.541 --> 41:29.665
and he'd had an appalling history
of getting it all wrong.

41:30.541 --> 41:32.165
One Valentine's Day

41:32.166 --> 41:37.457
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift
he was sure was appropriate.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.749
(Zelda screams)

41:43.250 --> 41:47.165
The only companion (swallows)
that had ever warmed Max's bed

41:47.208 --> 41:49.332
was his hot water bottle.

41:50.958 --> 41:52.082
Romance and love

41:52.083 --> 41:55.374
was a mysterious language
he'd given up on.

41:56.083 --> 41:59.290
lf only Mary had asked
how a toaster works

41:59.291 --> 42:02.832
or asked for an explanation
of the Chaos theory.

42:02.875 --> 42:07.374
lf only there was
a mathematical equation for love.

42:08.958 --> 42:12.790
He kept eating and thinking.

42:17.750 --> 42:20.749
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

42:23.541 --> 42:26.749
(Kissing)

42:27.750 --> 42:33.790
But love was not like Max's Rubik's Cube.
lt could not be solved.

42:33.791 --> 42:37.374
No matter how he analysed it,
the results were negative.

42:37.791 --> 42:39.624
Beat it, creep!

42:39.666 --> 42:43.040
He felt love but couldn't articulate it.

42:43.041 --> 42:47.457
lts logic was as foreign to him as...
as a salad sandwich.

42:49.708 --> 42:51.957
The stars made more sense.

42:56.791 --> 42:59.124
(Sirens wail)

42:59.125 --> 43:02.374
(Radio) : 1 2, have you responded
to the call? Over.

43:02.375 --> 43:05.790
The anxiety and stress were too much.

43:05.791 --> 43:11.915
The inscrutability of love finally won,
and Max's brain gave in.

43:21.083 --> 43:24.624
He was diagnosed
with severe depression and obesity

43:24.625 --> 43:30.165
and spent the next 8 months
institutionalised and bedridden.

43:30.291 --> 43:33.540
They marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs

43:33.541 --> 43:37.249
and performed
the usual 'therapeutic' procedures.

43:37.291 --> 43:40.249
(Electricity buzzes, Max gurgles)

43:42.666 --> 43:46.249
Meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.999
(Lonely cello and piano)

43:48.000 --> 43:51.124
Maybe Max's typewriter
had run out of ink.

43:51.416 --> 43:54.999
Maybe America had run out of ink.

43:55.583 --> 43:57.999
Maybe his pets had eaten him.

43:59.250 --> 44:01.665
Maybe it was her.

44:01.708 --> 44:06.290
Was she too demanding,
too boring, too...ugly?

44:08.291 --> 44:11.332
(Lonely cello and piano)

44:14.416 --> 44:18.415
Filled with anger, confusion
and self-loathing,

44:18.458 --> 44:23.332
Mary tried to erase
the memory of her friend forever.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.999
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

44:40.875 --> 44:42.999
(Toilet flushes)

44:52.541 --> 44:54.415
(Knock at door)

44:57.708 --> 45:00.457
(Knocking gets louder)

45:03.291 --> 45:04.707
(Groaning)

45:06.875 --> 45:09.249
(Cat miaows meekly)

45:12.666 --> 45:13.957
Max had recovered.

45:13.958 --> 45:18.874
And life was balanced, safe
and symmetrical once again.

45:21.625 --> 45:26.124
But Mary still lingered in his mind.
(Sighs)

45:26.166 --> 45:28.957
Half of him wanted to write to her immediately.

45:28.958 --> 45:33.457
The other half didn't want to end up
a mental patient again.

45:33.458 --> 45:38.540
At least there was always Mr Ravioli
to be friends with.

45:38.541 --> 45:41.582
He was a much safer option.

45:42.583 --> 45:46.540
He wondered what Mary was doing
right now.

45:47.458 --> 45:50.207
But she was far from content

45:50.208 --> 45:56.332
and struggled on by herself,
saving her money for a rainy day.

45:58.333 --> 46:01.290
(Soprano, twinkling piano)

46:03.833 --> 46:06.040
Life went on as usual for Max

46:06.041 --> 46:09.957
and even though he opted
for order and stability,

46:09.958 --> 46:13.415
misfortune was never far away.

46:14.208 --> 46:17.082
(Spluttering and cracking)

46:18.833 --> 46:20.457
(Loud rushing noise)

46:20.458 --> 46:23.165
(Silence)

46:23.166 --> 46:24.957
(Loud rushing noise)

46:24.958 --> 46:27.207
(Silence)

46:27.250 --> 46:28.832
(Loud rushing noise)

46:28.833 --> 46:30.957
(Silence)

46:36.875 --> 46:39.165
(Loud crash)

46:42.708 --> 46:46.707
Luckily, his manslaughter charges
were dismissed (Gavel taps)

46:46.708 --> 46:49.665
because he was labelled
mentally deficient

46:49.666 --> 46:53.874
and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist...

46:53.875 --> 46:55.040
Oop.

46:55.083 --> 46:56.707
..unlike most people.

46:58.500 --> 47:02.082
From then on,
Max cooled himself differently

47:02.083 --> 47:04.624
and things went back to normal

47:04.625 --> 47:10.582
until after his 48th birthday,
when his numbers finally came up.

47:10.583 --> 47:12.957
(TV announcer): Welcome
to the New York Lottery

47:12.958 --> 47:15.165
and these are tonight's
winning numbers -

47:15.166 --> 47:18.457
3, 5,

47:18.458 --> 47:24.457
6, 9,

47:24.458 --> 47:30.457
1 1 and 1 2!

47:30.875 --> 47:34.165
(Joyous choral and orchestral music)

48:08.458 --> 48:10.457
(Light pings off, door slams closed)

48:12.083 --> 48:14.040
Max was sensible
with his sudden wealth

48:14.041 --> 48:17.332
and had bought a lifetime supply
of chocolate

48:17.333 --> 48:20.415
and the complete Noblet collection.

48:20.416 --> 48:22.874
(TV plays 'The Noblets' theme music)

48:24.625 --> 48:28.082
Two of his life goals had come true.

48:28.125 --> 48:31.082
But he still had a lot of money

48:31.083 --> 48:33.540
so decided to give it to lvy...

48:33.541 --> 48:34.832
(Cash register chings)

48:34.916 --> 48:38.124
..who was also very sensible...

48:39.875 --> 48:43.082
(Comical '60s-style' music)

48:44.500 --> 48:47.582
(Bones crack, she groans)

48:47.583 --> 48:50.624
(Drill whines, hammering)

48:55.083 --> 48:57.457
(Satisfied farting sounds)

49:06.208 --> 49:08.915
(Engines backfire and splutter)

49:11.791 --> 49:15.874
..until her own numbers came up.

49:24.375 --> 49:28.374
lvy willed everything
to the local cat shelter,

49:28.375 --> 49:33.540
whose owner relocated
her kind donation to his bank account,

49:33.541 --> 49:39.999
his wife's new breasts, a Ferrari
and enough fuel to get to Mexico.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.999
(Engine revs)

49:43.000 --> 49:44.874
(Musical horn)

49:47.875 --> 49:51.874
Despite achieving all his life's goals,

49:51.875 --> 49:56.332
Max still felt incomplete.
(Sighs)

49:56.333 --> 49:59.915
Mr Ravioli just wasn't
cutting the mustard anymore

49:59.916 --> 50:05.082
and seemed more interested
in his self-help books.

50:05.166 --> 50:08.582
Mary had given Max
a taste of real friendship

50:08.583 --> 50:12.082
and there was just no comparison.

50:12.750 --> 50:14.915
She missed him too

50:14.916 --> 50:17.874
but no longer saved to see him.
(Aah!)

50:19.000 --> 50:22.957
(Coin clinks) She now saved
for a different reason.

50:25.125 --> 50:28.624
(Quiet, jazzy Russian folk music)

50:32.875 --> 50:38.540
One day Mr Ravioli got up,
left and never came back.

50:39.916 --> 50:41.790
(Whistling, thud!)
(Hisses)

50:42.500 --> 50:45.957
Max sought Dr Hazelhof's advice.

50:45.958 --> 50:47.374
(Speaks incoherently)

50:47.416 --> 50:52.499
He told Max that true friendship
is seen through the heart,

50:52.500 --> 50:54.499
not through the eyes,

50:54.500 --> 51:02.499
and that it was time he wrote to Mary
to reveal his true self, warts and all.

51:02.541 --> 51:05.540
Max understood.
(Sighs)

51:09.666 --> 51:14.290
(City sounds of roadworks
and pigeons)

51:22.958 --> 51:25.790
(Max): Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

51:25.791 --> 51:28.415
there is something l have to tell you

51:28.458 --> 51:32.374
which will explain
why l have not written.

51:32.375 --> 51:38.957
Each time l received one of your letters,
l had a severe anxiety attack.

51:38.958 --> 51:43.624
This is because recently,
while l was in a mental institution,

51:43.625 --> 51:50.540
they diagnosed that l have a new thing
called Asperger's syndrome,

51:50.541 --> 51:57.915
which is a neurobiological,
pervasive, developmental disability.

51:57.916 --> 52:01.624
l prefer 'Aspie' for short.

52:01.625 --> 52:05.582
l will now list some of the traits
of an Aspie.

52:05.583 --> 52:07.499
(Camera clicks)

52:08.083 --> 52:13.040
No.1 - l find the world
very confusing and chaotic

52:13.041 --> 52:18.415
because my mind
is very literal and logical.

52:18.416 --> 52:21.665
(Train rattles)

52:21.708 --> 52:28.124
2 - l have trouble understanding
the expressions on people's faces.

52:28.166 --> 52:36.582
When l was younger, l made a book
to help me when l was confused.

52:37.916 --> 52:39.374
(Slap!)

52:39.375 --> 52:42.915
l still have trouble with some people.

52:42.958 --> 52:46.249
lvy was hard to understand
because of her wrinkles

52:46.250 --> 52:49.874
and because her eyebrows weren't real.

52:51.041 --> 52:53.540
3 - l have bad handwriting,

52:53.541 --> 52:56.540
am hypersensitive...
(Phone rings, Max gasps)

52:56.541 --> 52:59.249
..clumsy

52:59.291 --> 53:02.832
and can get very concerned.
(Anxious murmuring)

53:06.333 --> 53:14.124
4 - l like solving problems.
lvy said this is a good thing.

53:14.250 --> 53:15.915
(Camera clicks)

53:16.708 --> 53:21.999
And finally No.5 -
l have trouble expressing my emotions.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.249
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
my brain is defective

53:27.250 --> 53:32.957
but one day there will be a cure
for my disability.

53:32.958 --> 53:35.457
l do not like it when he says this.

53:35.458 --> 53:40.540
l do not feel disabled, defective
or l need to be cured.

53:40.541 --> 53:43.582
l like being an Aspie.

53:43.666 --> 53:47.957
lt would be like trying to change
the colour of my eyes.

53:49.708 --> 53:53.832
There is one thing
l wish l could change, however.

53:53.833 --> 53:55.540
(Toilet flushes)

53:55.541 --> 53:58.165
l wish l could cry properly.

53:58.166 --> 54:00.665
(He groans softly)

54:00.666 --> 54:06.040
l squeeze and squeeze
but nothing...(he groans)...comes out.

54:06.041 --> 54:09.540
l cry when l cut onions
but this does not count.

54:09.541 --> 54:12.457
Anyway, do you like the word
'cumquat'?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.582
lt is a type of fruit.

54:14.583 --> 54:17.457
Do you have
a favourite-sounding word?

54:17.500 --> 54:21.415
My top 5 are ointment, bumblebee,

54:21.416 --> 54:24.790
Vladivostok, banana

54:24.791 --> 54:26.790
and testicle.

54:28.541 --> 54:32.665
l have also invented some new words -

54:32.708 --> 54:40.165
'confuzzled', which is being confused
and puzzled at the same time,

54:40.208 --> 54:45.040
'snirt', which is a cross between
snow and dirt,

54:45.041 --> 54:47.540
and 'smushables' ...
(Grumbles)

54:47.541 --> 54:53.165
..which are squashed groceries
you find at the bottom of the bag.

54:53.208 --> 54:57.207
l have sent a letter
to the Oxford Dictionary people

54:57.208 --> 55:00.665
asking them to include my words

55:00.666 --> 55:03.999
but l have not heard back.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.499
lt is now time for me to go
to my Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

55:08.500 --> 55:12.082
There is a woman there
called Marjorie Buttersworth

55:12.083 --> 55:14.582
who confuzzles me.

55:14.625 --> 55:18.665
She kisses me without my permission

55:18.666 --> 55:25.582
so tonight l have decided to rub onions
under my armpits to repel her.

55:25.666 --> 55:30.707
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

55:35.166 --> 55:37.624
PS. Please find enclosed

55:37.625 --> 55:41.582
some chocolate-covered ants
l found at the deli.

55:42.791 --> 55:46.957
PPS. Not much has happened
since l last wrote

55:46.958 --> 55:53.582
except for my manslaughter charges,
lotto win and lvy's death.

55:56.958 --> 56:00.374
(Narrator): Mary was thrilled
Max had finally written

56:00.375 --> 56:03.165
and suddenly had a fabulous idea.

56:03.166 --> 56:05.165
A-ha! (Ting!)

56:09.958 --> 56:13.457
(Rippling piano and strings)

56:23.958 --> 56:25.957
(Lawnmower drones,
cat miaows)

56:29.416 --> 56:32.499
(Mary cries)

56:38.875 --> 56:42.832
Mary and Max's friendship
was resuscitated

56:42.875 --> 56:48.082
and her tears were the best gift
he'd ever received.

56:48.083 --> 56:52.457
lnside Max's head
his brain was smiling.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.624
Loaded up with bizarre forms
of chocolate,

56:56.625 --> 57:01.165
their letters flew thick and fast
between the continents.

57:01.166 --> 57:04.582
Max learnt to read Mary's letters
with caution

57:04.583 --> 57:08.707
and at the slightest tingle of tension,
he would stop,

57:08.750 --> 57:12.582
take his medication
and soothe his nerves.

57:12.625 --> 57:18.624
Each letter he would iron, laminate
and file in a special place,

57:18.625 --> 57:21.874
which also soothed his nerves.

57:26.208 --> 57:30.790
He enjoyed answering her questions
and solving her puzzles like -

57:30.875 --> 57:33.749
Do sheep shrink when it rains?

57:33.750 --> 57:37.832
Why do old men
wear their pants so high?

57:37.833 --> 57:43.165
Do gooses get goosebumps
and why is bellybutton lint blue?

57:43.166 --> 57:44.915
Are there Noblets in heaven?

57:44.916 --> 57:49.707
And if a taxi goes backwards,
does the driver owe you money?

57:49.708 --> 57:55.707
ln turn, Mary simply enjoyed
hearing about Max's fascinating life -

57:55.708 --> 57:58.207
how many people
he'd counted littering...

58:00.125 --> 58:03.582
(Whoosh! Thud!)

58:03.625 --> 58:05.957
..how the latest Henry had died...

58:05.958 --> 58:08.957
(Electric whisk whirrs in water)

58:13.208 --> 58:15.499
(Toaster crackles)

58:15.500 --> 58:18.832
..and new recipes he'd invented
for chicken.

58:22.375 --> 58:24.457
Each nourished the other

58:24.458 --> 58:27.374
and, as Mary grew taller,

58:27.375 --> 58:29.415
Max grew wider -

58:29.416 --> 58:35.249
their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on Mary's Noblets.

58:39.500 --> 58:42.457
Although Max found solace in Mary,

58:42.458 --> 58:45.874
he still found the rest of the world bewildering.

58:45.875 --> 58:47.707
And he couldn't understand

58:47.708 --> 58:50.790
why he was seen as the odd one

58:50.791 --> 58:53.832
while everyone else
was considered normal.

58:55.666 --> 58:59.249
Humans were endlessly illogical.

58:59.250 --> 59:04.665
Why did they throw out food when
there were children starving in lndia?

59:04.666 --> 59:09.499
Why did they clear the rainforests
when they needed the oxygen?

59:09.500 --> 59:16.332
And why did they create bus timetables
when they never ran on time?

59:16.333 --> 59:23.124
He agreed with his favourite physicist
that there are only two things infinite -

59:23.166 --> 59:27.207
the universe and man's stupidity.

59:27.208 --> 59:28.790
(Bicycle bell rings)

59:28.791 --> 59:34.665
And for Mary, even though
Max filled her with confidence...

59:34.666 --> 59:35.665
Bullseye!

59:35.666 --> 59:39.290
..her world was far from perfect.

59:39.291 --> 59:42.915
The grip of love had her by the throat.

59:48.166 --> 59:50.040
(Giggles nervously)

59:52.916 --> 59:55.915
(Sad rippling piano and brass)

59:55.916 --> 59:58.332
(Screams)

59:58.333 --> 01:00:00.707
(Thunder, rain pattering)

01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:08.999
At 4.59pm, on the 8th of the 8th, 1 988...

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.999
(Whistle blows)

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:15.832
..Noel Norman Dinkle
attached his last string

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:22.165
and, after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags, he retired.

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:27.332
To celebrate, Noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:31.165
and taking up metal detecting instead.

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:34.957
But, sadly, it was not a hobby
he had for long.

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:41.207
(Loud rumbling)

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:49.457
(Metal detector beeps)

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:53.790
(Melancholy cello and piano)

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:03.707
(Mary sobs quietly)

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:15.749
ln his will, Noel had left Mary
some money

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:20.832
so she decided to go to university
and study disorders of the mind,

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:24.832
yearning to learn more about her friend.

01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:30.957
Mary was as popular at university
as she was at school.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:34.415
Damian went there too,
aching to be a Thespian.

01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:37.415
Hi there, M-M-Mary.

01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:41.165
Hi...hello!

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:50.499
(They laugh)

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.332
(Damian) : That was damn f-f-funny!

01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:55.332
(She sobs)

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.624
(Rippling piano and strings)

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:30.082
Hey, Damian,
your mum's roses look fab!

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:32.665
Oh, th-th-th-thanks, Mary.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.207
Um. M-Mary,
can l tell you something?

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:37.124
Sure, babe!

01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:42.374
Um, um, you've got d-d-d-d-dog's poo
on your shoe.

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:46.374
(Mary sobs)

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.540
(Mary): Dear Max,

01:02:56.541 --> 01:02:58.540
l have been such an idiot.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:01.040
l've wasted all my money
on something pointless

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:03.040
when l should have been saving
to see you.

01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:08.165
l know love upsets you
so l won't go on about it.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:12.707
All l want to say is that love
is obviously not for me.

01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:17.124
l hope you are well and enjoy
the chocolate cigarettes l've enclosed.

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:18.582
Love Mary.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.874
(Swallows loudly)

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.957
Oh, you should be ashamed!

01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:38.374
- Come on, baby. Let's go.
- Oh, Mum...

01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:41.665
l told you never to talk to strangers.

01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:45.124
(Ting!)

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:50.499
(Dogs howl distantly,
Vera hums a tune)

01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:55.915
(Narrator): Noel's sudden death
had filled Vera with remorse and guilt

01:03:55.916 --> 01:04:00.457
and she coped
in the only way she knew.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:09.124
(Vera hums a sad tune)

01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:25.999
(Bottle smashes)

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:30.124
(Vera drinks)

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:35.707
(She coughs repeatedly and retches)

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:51.832
(Quiet, foreboding music)

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:34.957
('Zorba the Greek' plays softly)

01:05:36.291 --> 01:05:37.957
(Mary): Dear Max,

01:05:37.958 --> 01:05:41.582
our wedding day was everything
l have ever dreamt,

01:05:41.583 --> 01:05:44.624
making up for the terrible year l've had.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.832
" "

01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:49.707
Although all the guests
were Damian's family and friends,

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.832
l felt very welcome.

01:05:55.458 --> 01:06:00.207
Damian is so perfect.
He even made my wedding dress.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.582
And for our honeymoon

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:05.082
he took me to Mykonos -
his favourite island in Greece.

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:06.915
l got to ride a donkey

01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:10.582
and found the perfect gift for Len.

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:14.707
Poor Len, he's still struggling
with his agoraphobia.

01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:15.957
(Horn beeps)

01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:18.582
Aaaaahhhh!

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:21.749
(Tyres screech, car crashes)

01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:25.582
Damian and l are so similar.

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:29.832
He even has his own penfriend,
who lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:32.665
(She giggles)

01:06:33.583 --> 01:06:35.624
(Damian): Mary...M-M-M-Mary.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.582
(Damian): Mary...M-M-M-Mary.
(Bed squeaks)

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:40.332
(Mary) : Ohhh.

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:45.874
Mary was bursting with self-esteem

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.874
and her confidence
was almost unbearable.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.874
(She purrs seductively)

01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:53.582
At university, she shone

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:58.957
and took it upon herself
to cure the world of mental illness.

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:05.332
(Rippling piano and strings)

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:08.915
She did her thesis
on Asperger's syndrome

01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:12.957
and used Max as her case study.

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.749
Her professors
were thoroughly impressed

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:19.624
and her writing praised far and wide.

01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:23.290
Soon, publishers queued
to print her unique insight

01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:30.915
and by her 25th birthday, thousands
of copies were ready to be shipped.

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.749
(Mary): Dear Max,

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.374
l am very proud to give you

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:37.915
the very first copy of my book
about your disability

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:42.374
and the hopes that we have
to one day cure it.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.290
Even more exciting

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:50.082
is that l am finally coming to meet
and celebrate with you in one week's time.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.415
l'm also going to give you
half the royalties.

01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:56.915
Your loving friend, Mary.

01:07:56.916 --> 01:08:01.457
PS. Please find enclosed
some chocolate-coated Swiss almonds.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:10.915
(Narrator): Max didn't take the news
very well -

01:08:10.916 --> 01:08:13.915
not very well at all.

01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:16.790
(Max): Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:22.124
l cannot express myself
very clearly at this moment

01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:28.540
and so l will list my emotions
in the order they feel most intense -

01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:36.082
hurt, confuzzledness, betrayal, discomfort,
distress and wheeziness.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:39.457
This last one is not really an emotion

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:42.124
but l thought you should know about it anyway.

01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:54.165
(Max's heart beats loudly)

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:56.832
(He roars)

01:09:13.957 --> 01:09:18.999
With her suitcase packed for New York,
Mary said goodbye to Damian.

01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:26.832
She hadn't been this excited since
she'd found a Noblet in the gutter.

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:31.207
But her excitement
suddenly dribbled away

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:33.832
like a chocolate in the sun.

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:41.374
(Soprano sings sadly,
thunder rumbles)

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:15.957
(Singing intensifies)

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:21.874
(Violent shredding noises)

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:50.165
Mary slowly sank
into a puddle of depression, self-loathing

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:52.540
and cooking sherry.

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:58.207
The only colour left in her life
was her beloved Damian,

01:10:58.208 --> 01:11:04.207
only an arm's length away
but as distant as the moon.

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:07.290
(TV plays 'The Noblets' theme music)

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:14.749
She lost interest in the world
and it lost interest in her

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:19.832
as a horrible apparition began to haunt.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:24.082
She started to spend her nights
making pompoms

01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:27.624
and eating two-minute noodles.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:37.790
(Mournful cello solo)

01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:01.374
(Max wheezes)

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.540
(Funky jazz organ)

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:33.999
Each day, with strength and shame,

01:12:34.041 --> 01:12:38.249
Mary trudged to the letterbox in hope,

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:43.499
only to swivel, shrivel
and slink back inside.

01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:46.540
(Swing brass)

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:20.457
(Rooster clucks and crows)

01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:22.415
(Mary gasps, crashes off couch)

01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:28.415
(Swing brass)

01:13:37.541 --> 01:13:39.540
(Damian) : My dearest Mary,

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:42.957
by the time you read this,
l will be on a plane to New Zealand

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:45.290
to begin a new life.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:49.415
You probably haven't even noticed
l'd packed my bags.

01:13:49.416 --> 01:13:54.040
I have fallen in love
with my penfriend, Desmond,

01:13:54.041 --> 01:13:56.707
and I'm going to live
on his sheep farm.

01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:59.165
(Sheep baa)

01:13:59.166 --> 01:14:02.832
lt's been hard to watch you become
a remnant of the person I once loved.

01:14:02.833 --> 01:14:05.749
Your research into m-m-mental illness
has been admirable

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:11.040
but your i-idealistic pursuit to remedy it
has been misguided.

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:14.332
Mary, you have to realise y-you are not
a magic beauty cream

01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:18.832
you can smooth on the world
to rid it of its wrinkles.

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:20.707
l love you, Mary,

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:23.957
but l love Desmond more.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:27.332
l hope one day your heart will heal
and we can be friends.

01:14:27.333 --> 01:14:30.499
Yours compassionately,
Damian.

01:14:37.166 --> 01:14:40.832
(Sad piano solo)

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.540
(Distant sirens)

01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:56.207
(Max): Aaaarghh!

01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:58.415
Dear Mayor Ridiculani,

01:14:58.416 --> 01:15:06.665
on Monday l counted 27 people
illegally dropping cigarette butts.

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:09.332
l would like to recommend
the fine be increased

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:14.540
to a minimum of $1 million
as a stronger deterrent

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:17.957
and would be happy...

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:36.457
(Max groans)

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.832
(Warning bell rings)

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:54.832
Thank you.

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:10.874
(He inhales)

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.332
(Max gasps)

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:27.457
(Ominous music)

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:28.999
(Max yells)

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:39.957
Sorry.

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:47.040
(Distant city noises)

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:02.124
Dear Mary,

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:06.582
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

01:17:06.583 --> 01:17:09.874
as a sign that l forgive you.

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:14.624
When l received your book,
the emotions inside...

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:36.124
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:16.124
(Narrator): On the way home,
Max sat to count the stars.

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.790
He felt complete -

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:21.957
the world was back in balance.

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:30.499
(Jazzy Russian folk music)

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:40.749
(Lonely cello solo)

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.665
(Rooster snores)

01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:02.957
(Fly buzzes, rooster snores)

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.082
(Thunder rumbles, rain patters)

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.415
(Mystical rippling music)

01:19:43.666 --> 01:19:49.165
(Mary sings)
" When l was just a little girl

01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:55.165
" l asked my mother, what will l be?

01:19:56.291 --> 01:20:02.665
" Will l be pretty, will l be rich?

01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:07.040
" Here's what she said to me...

01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:12.999
" Que sera sera

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.665
" Whatever will be will be

01:20:18.666 --> 01:20:23.790
" The future's not ours to see

01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:28.540
" Que sera sera

01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:43.374
(Discordant instrumental interlude)

01:20:54.625 --> 01:20:59.290
" Que sera sera

01:20:59.291 --> 01:21:05.249
" Whatever will be will be

01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:10.499
" The future's not ours to see

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:26.415
" Que sera sera "

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.165
(Knock at door)

01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:38.165
(Knocking continues)

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.957
(Dogs bark)

01:21:48.708 --> 01:21:50.124
(Len): Ah!

01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:54.290
(Narrator): Len had saved the day
and after 45 years

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:59.165
he finally conquered his agoraphobia.

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.707
(Driver): Moron!

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:06.165
(Len laughs triumphantly)

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:16.124
(Max): Dear Mary,

01:22:16.125 --> 01:22:20.957
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:24.999
as a sign that l forgive you.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.957
When l received your book,
the emotions inside my brain

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:34.040
felt like they were in a tumble dryer,
smashing into each other.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:39.707
The hurt felt like when l accidentally
stapled my lips together.

01:22:39.708 --> 01:22:41.415
Ow!

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:46.999
The reason l forgive you
is because you are not perfect.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.999
You are imperfect, and so am l.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.999
All humans are imperfect,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.415
even the man outside my apartment
who litters.

01:22:58.458 --> 01:23:04.915
When l was young,
l wanted to be anybody but myself.

01:23:04.958 --> 01:23:08.957
Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
if l was on a desert island

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:12.665
then l would have to get used
to my own company -

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:15.915
just me and the coconuts.

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:22.540
He said l would have to accept myself,
my warts and all,

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:25.540
and that we don't get to choose
our warts.

01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:29.207
They are a part of us
and we have to live with them.

01:23:31.041 --> 01:23:35.207
We can, however, choose our friends

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:40.540
and l am glad l have chosen you.

01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:43.707
Dr Bernard Hazelhof also said

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:48.249
that everyone's lives
are like a very long sidewalk.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:52.957
Some are well paved.
Others, like mine,

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:58.540
have cracks, banana skins
and cigarette butts.

01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:05.540
Your sidewalk is like mine
but probably not as many cracks.

01:24:05.583 --> 01:24:09.582
Hopefully, one day
our sidewalks will meet

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:13.249
and we can share
a can of condensed milk.

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:17.040
(She slurps)

01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:23.332
You are my best friend.
You are my only friend.

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:28.790
Your American penpal,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:35.040
PS. l have recently found the perfect job
with a survey company.

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:39.874
All l have to do is eat things
and tick boxes.

Hello?

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.957
Max, it's us!

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.249
We're here!

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:33.249
Oh, Max?

(Alto singing serenely with woodwind)

01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:44.374
(Narrator): Max had died peacefully
that morning

01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:48.540
after finishing his final can
of condensed milk.
