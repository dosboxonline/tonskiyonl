D'oh!

25:11.301 --> 25:13.554
Puzzle line?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.723
Puzzle line.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.226
Now, I've traveled 10, 000 miles
in the past 24 hours,

25:19.309 --> 25:20.894

25:22.146 --> 25:26.817
but I believe neither one of you

25:30.320 --> 25:31.822
Before Mercury went operational,

25:31.905 --> 25:33.449
we ran a standard validation protocol.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.909
The works.
Double sets of paired Cray supercomputers,

25:35.993 --> 25:37.578

25:37.661 --> 25:39.872
chewing at Mercury 24 hours a day.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.582
Mercury came out unbent.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.293
Awesome, sir.
It was finally a code that couldn't be broken.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.964
But there was one last thing to check out.
The geek factor.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.176
DEAN: Human beings
will fool you sometimes.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.552
We thought it important…

25:53.635 --> 25:55.429
We slipped a message
at the back of a puzzle magazine,

25:55.512 --> 25:58.098
in one of those egghead word games.
We dared amateurs to crack it.

25:58.182 --> 26:01.059
— We were sure nobody would ever call.
— But somebody did.

26:03.979 --> 26:08.275
His name is Simon Lynch.
He lives in Chicago. He is nine years old.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.862
And he has deciphered a message
written in the most sophisticated code

26:11.945 --> 26:14.156
the world has ever known

26:14.239 --> 26:16.825
in a geek's puzzle magazine.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.787
I don't recall ever authorizing

26:19.870 --> 26:22.790
anyone to put any message

26:22.873 --> 26:24.708
into any magazine!

26:25.751 --> 26:27.878
That couldn't just happen.
A kid couldn't just pop it open.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.923
Not only is he nine years old,

26:31.006 --> 26:34.134
he is handicapped. He is autistic.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.595
Yes, that explains it.

26:36.678 --> 26:41.225
So our $2 billion code is an open book
to people of diminished capacity?

26:41.308 --> 26:42.518
No, sir.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.145
Autism isn't synonymous
with diminished capacity.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.398
Autistic people are… They're shut off.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.485
But it's not unusual
for an autistic person to be a savant.

26:51.568 --> 26:52.945
Oh, a savant!

26:53.028 --> 26:54.613
He may not be able to
actually decipher the code.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.324
— It might just appear to him.
— Right. He didn't calculate anything.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.119
He just saw it.
Like those stupid pictures at the mall.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.996
You stare at them. All of a sudden
you're looking at the Statue of Liberty.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.039
DEAN: Exactly.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.084
This is not a stupid picture at the mall.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.670
This is national security.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.633
Looking at the best case scenario,

27:15.259 --> 27:17.094
let's suppose the boy is unique

27:17.177 --> 27:20.138
and he doesn't understand
what he's just done.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.015
Does that solve my problem?

27:22.099 --> 27:23.684
Answer: No!

27:23.767 --> 27:26.937
Analysis:
All we need now is for someone else

27:27.020 --> 27:29.523
who understands his capability
to come along,

27:29.606 --> 27:32.734
and my problems are increased exponentially.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.613
Then maybe we should talk to the kid.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.866
— And…
— No.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.785
No. No.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.875
There must be nothing
that connects the boy to this office.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:03.677
There are guys like that.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.013
Yes, I know,
but I don't happen to be one of them.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.516
Listen to me. Look at me!

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.601
This is not about me.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:14.938
It's about that little boy.
And he needs some help.

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:18.066
As far as I can tell,
you are a decent, caring person.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:22.028
I promise you we will be out of your life
as soon as possible. Okay?

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:25.824
Look, if for some reason
there is an emergency…

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.576
Oh, you mean a different emergency.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:28.952
Yes, a different emergency.

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:30.829
Do not call the police, okay?

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.248
You call this guy. He's with the FBI.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.709
I call the FBI, not the police?

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.712
Right. The police can't protect Simon.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:39.796
Right.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.006
Look.

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:45.343
Simon is only in danger
if they know where he is.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.220
They don't know where he is,
so he's not in danger,

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:49.473
so you're not in danger. All right?

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:53.727
Right. Unless there's an emergency.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.896
(CHUCKLES)

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:00.150
It's good to see you're keeping
your sense of humor about this.

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:01.401
Yeah.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:06.573
I promise you I will be back in this apartment
at 2: 00 tomorrow afternoon.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.494
And I don't know how yet,
but I will make this up to you.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:12.370
Okay?

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:13.830
Thank you.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.373
Take care.

01:28:27.928 --> 01:28:29.846
I don't know if it qualifies as a plan.

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.974
I'm gonna fly there and show him Leo's letter.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:35.185
Here's the bad news.

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:39.356
You gotta get Simon into
the Witness Protection Program right away.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:42.234
Art, I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.195
How do you expect me
to authorize a move like that?

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.490
Lie, cheat. I don't give a shit.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:50.450
You don't do it, that kid's as good as dead.

01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:53.954
Has it occurred to you that
maybe Kudrow would shoot you on sight?

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:56.248
Yeah, that has occurred to me.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:29:00.627
If that happens,
you know what to do with these.

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:03.797
Hope I see you later.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:13.723
Sandy.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.225
So glad you could make it.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.644
Heard Ted had back surgery.
Did you have anything to do with that?

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:18.728

01:29:18.812 --> 01:29:19.896
Excuse me.

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:29.072
Can I help you?

01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:31.741
Excuse me.

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.368
Nick, my good friend.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.330
I want you to know that
your Mercury thing is a goddamn triumph.

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:39.624
— I mean that.
— I appreciate that, Senator.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.543
A feather in your cap.

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.837
The Oversight Committee
is singing your praises.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.964
You're getting a reputation
as the «can do» guy.

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.091
Thank you. I do appreciate that.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:50.093
— There's a guy outside.
— Who?

01:29:50.176 --> 01:29:51.887
Says he's with the Bureau.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.723
Would you excuse me one moment, please?

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:58.852
If he wasn't Bureau,
I wouldn't have bothered you.

01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:01.438
I would've lost him, but I didn't know, sir.

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:04.190
No, Ted, you used good judgment.
I'd like to see him.

01:30:04.274 --> 01:30:06.109
He's not very presentable.

01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:09.904
Bring him in the back way.
Take him to the wine cellar. I'll be down.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:16.119
Nick, I can't believe you look so good
for someone so old!

01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:17.203
How do you do that?

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:19.706
Drugs, my dear. Massive doses of drugs.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.544
KUDROW: Please don't handle the wine,
Mr. Jeffries.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:28.715
Yes, I've read your file.

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:32.469
A deeply troubled FBI agent
with a lousy record

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.679
kidnaps a nine-year-old boy.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:37.223
Nice goin'.

01:30:37.891 --> 01:30:41.686
You come to my home in the middle
of a social function carrying a gun

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:45.482
to confront me
with this fabricated unsigned accusation

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:47.400
allegedly written by Leo Pedranski

01:30:47.484 --> 01:30:51.071
who was killed the day before yesterday
by you, for all I know.

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:54.699
What do you want from me?
I'd like to get back to my guests.

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:59.788
Unsigned accusation
was typed on carbon paper.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.915
Who uses that anymore?

01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:05.335
The late Leo Pedranski's fingerprints
were all over it.

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:09.673
The Pomerello's a little corky.

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:13.051
I'm sure the Senate Oversight Committee
won't have any problem

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:15.053
connecting you to the murder.

01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:19.933
But you haven't given the carbon
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:22.560
If you had, you wouldn't be here right now.

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:25.855
You've got your precious carbon
tucked away

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:28.358
guaranteeing your safety, etcetera, etcetera

01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:30.944
so you can come here and demand what?

01:31:31.111 --> 01:31:33.488
Untold millions in unmarked bills?

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:35.407
I asked you not to handle the wine, please.

got your priorities in order.

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:45.083
That's better.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.545
You're not worried
about murdering a nine-year-old boy,

01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:50.088
but you're worried about this fucking wine?

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.840
(GLASS SHATTERING)

Here's the deal.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.387
I don't give the Senate Oversight Committee
the carbon.

01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:00.890
They don't waste three years with
their investigation, wailing and moaning,

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:03.601
«How could this happen in America?»

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:06.813
while you have one of your spooks
whack Simon Lynch.

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:08.231
Or?

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:11.901
Or you do the only thing
that'll guarantee Simon Lynch his safety.

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:16.030
You or one of your superiors
or the president of the United States,

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:18.074
I don't give a fuck who,

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.910
but someone is gonna go
on national television and tell America

01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:23.246
that your billion dollar uncrackable code

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:26.166
has been cracked by
a nine-year-old autistic boy.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.294
Then you get your carbon back.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:36.843
You know what I think, Mr. Jeffries?

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:42.390
I think you've seen too many of those
four-wheel drive commercials on TV.

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:43.808

The ones where you get to drive fast
and be a renegade.

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:50.440
Let's talk about the real world

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:54.694
where you're not some wonderful
lone wolf hero, but you're part of a team.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:58.990
And you play your position
because that's what America is.

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.367
It's one big team.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:06.623
This might be difficult for you to grasp,
but I am a patriot.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.252
And a patriot is one
who makes the right moral choice.

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:15.090
Sometimes it takes a strong man
to make that choice.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:20.595
One boy who cannot survive on his own,
one of nature's mistakes,

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:24.140
weighed against the lives
of thousands of our people.

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:26.643
Think about it. You worked undercover.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:30.563
How many of our agents will be put
in harm's way if this code is compromised?

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:32.440
Members of your team.

SIMON: Up.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:05.088
That's where we're goin', Simon.

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:09.342
Come on.

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:15.348
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.442
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:40.081
STACEY: Is that you, Art?

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:46.212
I'm a United States marshal
with the Witness Protection Program.

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:48.339
How do you do?

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:51.384
Good.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.473
You must be Simon.

01:38:57.557 --> 01:38:59.350
PETER: Chopper on approach, sir.

01:39:02.145 --> 01:39:03.354
Why don't you come with me, son?

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:04.439
No!

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:06.232
He doesn't like to be touched by strangers.

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:07.650
I'll take him.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:12.321
Come on, Simon. Let's go see the helicopter.

01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:16.868
I thought Art was supposed to meet us here.

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:18.369
There's been a change in plans.

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:21.998
But I want to assure you that your country
owes you the greatest debt of gratitude.

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.959
PETER: Chopper coming in!
Don't have much time!

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:31.674
For the safety of the boy, you should
go home now and forget you were here.

01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:37.680
Okay, Simon,
you're gonna go for a ride in the helicopter.

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:39.765
Goodbye, Simon.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.227
You can go with him.

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.084
Tommy.

01:40:07.168 --> 01:40:09.378
LOMAX: <i>They're on the helipad,
and the chopper's coming in.</i>

01:40:09.462 --> 01:40:11.505
<i>You have a green light. Go, go, go, go!</i>

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:13.549
— It's a go. Let's move.
— Go, go!

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.930
Hold them back!

01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:24.644
(GROANING)

01:40:26.395 --> 01:40:27.897
Stay down! Stay down!

01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:41.619
No! No!

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:43.287
(GUNS FIRING)

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.101

01:42:15.838 --> 01:42:17.214
(GASPS)

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:20.426
Get up. Get up, get up.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.470
That's right.

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:51.874
Tommy, no! Hold 'em back!

01:42:51.957 --> 01:42:53.834
TOMMY: Hold your fire! Keep 'em back now!

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:56.462
(SIMON SCREAMING)

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:35.334
Where's the team leader?

01:43:35.418 --> 01:43:36.752
Right here, Agent Jeffries.

01:43:36.836 --> 01:43:40.256
It's Kudrow's piece.
I got a nine-millimeter on the sidewalk.

01:43:40.339 --> 01:43:41.966
I'll take care of it.

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.549
TEACHER: Let's see what you got.

01:44:23.883 --> 01:44:25.259
I want you to say «bug. "

01:44:25.342 --> 01:44:26.385
GIRL: Bug.

01:44:26.469 --> 01:44:28.971
— Can you look at me?
— Mmm-hmm.

01:44:29.054 --> 01:44:30.765
— Bug.
— Bug.

01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:33.517
That's very good. I like that very much.

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:42.693
Can I help you?

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:45.780
I'm Art Jeffries, a friend of Simon Lynch.

01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:49.784
Yes, I know.
His foster parents told me all about you.

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:52.661
How's he doing?

01:44:52.745 --> 01:44:54.079
He's fine.

01:44:54.747 --> 01:44:56.749
He's adjusted very well.

01:44:58.751 --> 01:45:00.544
Do you want to say hello?

01:45:00.628 --> 01:45:02.755
He probably wouldn't remember me.

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.340
I was told

01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:07.593
not to expect too much.

01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:09.595
I brought him some puzzles.

01:45:09.929 --> 01:45:11.597
He likes puzzles.

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:13.849
Do you think
you could give these to him, please?

01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:18.521
Sure, but I think it would be better for Simon
if you did.

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:21.065
It's okay. Come on.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:23.609
Thank you.

01:45:33.786 --> 01:45:35.120
Hey, Simon.

01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:37.831
How you doin', partner?

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.671
I brought you some new puzzles.

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:46.382
You might like those.

01:45:51.136 --> 01:45:53.013
Hey, Simon, look at me.

01:45:55.558 --> 01:45:57.226
Look at me, Simon.

01:45:57.309 --> 01:45:58.936
Look in my eyes.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.313
Look in my eyes.

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:07.653
It's me, Art.
