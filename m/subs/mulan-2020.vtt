WEBVTT

00:39.831 --> 00:41.416
There have been many tales

00:41.500 --> 00:43.335
of the great warrior, Mulan.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.675
But, ancestors,
this one is mine.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.386
Here she is.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.013
A young shoot, all green...

00:55.848 --> 00:58.058
unaware of the blade.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.062
If you had such a daughter...

01:02.229 --> 01:06.191
her chi, the boundless energy
of life itself...

01:06.358 --> 01:08.986
speaking through
her every motion...

01:09.152 --> 01:13.198
could you tell her that
only a son could wield chi?

01:14.658 --> 01:19.496
That a daughter would risk
shame, dishonor, exile?

01:21.874 --> 01:25.502
Ancestors, I could not.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.196
This way.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.616
That's the last one.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
Gently.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.787
Mulan! Forget the chicken!

02:01.914 --> 02:02.998
It will come back!

02:08.754 --> 02:10.047
No!

02:13.592 --> 02:16.678
Tell me your sister
is not the cause of this.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.974
Mulan!

02:21.058 --> 02:23.018
Take control of yourself!

02:49.545 --> 02:52.214
Mulan!
Listen very carefully.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
No!

03:27.749 --> 03:31.211
Mulan, what happened
when you fell off the roof?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.131
It was like you were a bird.

03:34.298 --> 03:35.799
Don't panic.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.093
There's a spider
crawling in your hair.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.512
You know I'm afraid of spiders.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.265
This is not one of
your tricks, is it, Mulan?

03:43.348 --> 03:46.852
Don't worry,
if you hold very still...

03:47.019 --> 03:49.146
I will squash it.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.857
It is because I'm trying
to protect Mulan

03:51.940 --> 03:52.941
that I say this.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.026
Mulan is young.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.153
She is still learning
how to control herself.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.864
You make excuses for her.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.535
You forget, Mulan is
a daughter, not a son.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.788
A daughter brings honor
through marriage.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.334
Any man would be fortunate to
marry either of our daughters.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.627
Including Mulan.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.671
I ask you, what man will want
to marry a girl

04:14.755 --> 04:16.882
who flits around rooftops,
chasing chickens?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.347
Xiu gives me no trouble.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.184
The matchmaker will find
a good husband for her.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.395
It is Mulan I worry about.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.732
They'll call her a witch.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.195
It's time you talked to her.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.490
Do you know why the phoenix

05:05.514 --> 05:07.474
sits at the entrance
of our shrine?

05:10.143 --> 05:13.522
She is the emissary
for our ancestors.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.148
But I broke her.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.946
Some say the phoenix
is consumed by flame...

05:21.446 --> 05:23.198
and emerges again.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.869
I think she can survive
a broken wing.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.956
Your chi is strong, Mulan.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.044
But chi is for warriors...

05:36.211 --> 05:38.297
not daughters.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.341
Soon, you'll be a young woman...

05:42.301 --> 05:44.386
and it is time for you...

05:46.054 --> 05:47.556
to hide your gift away.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.600
To...

05:50.601 --> 05:53.145
To silence its voice.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.441
I say this to protect you.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.028
That is my job.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.658
Your job is to bring honor
to the family.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.037
Do you think you can do that?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.272
Rourans? It can't be.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.317
Close the gates!

08:15.621 --> 08:16.622
Take out the leader!

09:02.459 --> 09:04.044
He's way too strong!

09:12.010 --> 09:13.595
You. You'll do.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.123
Your Majesty...

09:41.290 --> 09:44.126
six of our northern garrisons
along the Silk Road...

09:44.293 --> 09:46.628
have fallen
in a coordinated attack.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.173
All trade has been disrupted.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.049
If we allow this to continue,

09:51.133 --> 09:53.177
it could be
the end of the kingdom.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.761
And my citizens?

09:56.471 --> 09:57.556
Slaughtered.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.518
This soldier
is the only survivor.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.980
I fear more attacks will follow.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.316
Who is responsible?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.863
Rourans, Your Majesty.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.241
Their leader calls himself
Böri Khan.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.868
I killed Böri Khan.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.077
It is his son.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.038
He has united the tribes

10:21.121 --> 10:22.998
and resurrected the Rouran army.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.667
If I may, Your Imperial Majesty.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.381
You may speak.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.929
Böri Khan
fights alongside a woman.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.264
Her chi is beyond imagining.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.767
There is no place
for witches in this kingdom.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.645
It is forbidden
to use the power of chi

10:44.728 --> 10:46.188
in destructive ways.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.731
And yet, it is her skill

10:47.814 --> 10:49.816
that leads the Rouran army
to victory.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.778
She has trained an elite force
of shadow warriors

10:52.861 --> 10:54.154
to assist Böri Khan.

10:54.238 --> 10:57.449
We're not afraid of dark magic.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.953
We'll destroy this Rouran army
and their witch.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.456
Here's my decree.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.709
We'll build a mighty army.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.796
Every family
will supply one man.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.092
We'll protect
our beloved people...

11:15.259 --> 11:17.469
and crush these murderers.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.974
Deploy the Imperial Army.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.311
The dynasty
will not be threatened.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.894
So, you have news.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.813
The emperor sends his army

12:09.897 --> 12:11.315
to defend the Silk Road.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.399
Good.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.984
We will crush every garrison

12:14.067 --> 12:16.486
until the Imperial Army
is on its knees.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.488
And then...

12:19.573 --> 12:22.534
the Imperial City
will be laid bare.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.621
The emperor
will be mine to kill.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.248
You have proved useful, witch.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.833
Not witch.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.794
Warrior.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.966
I could tear you to pieces
before you blink.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.551
But you won't.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.181
Remember what you want...

12:45.224 --> 12:48.393
a place where your powers
will not be vilified.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.605
A place where you are accepted
for who you are.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.192
You won't get what you want
without me.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.991
When I found you
on a desert steppe

13:03.075 --> 13:04.576
wandering alone...

13:04.743 --> 13:06.203
you were exiled.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.163
A scorned dog.

13:09.039 --> 13:13.585
When I sit on the throne,
that dog will have a home.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.049
We will finish what we started.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.635
And you will see to it

13:21.718 --> 13:24.972
that nothing and no one
stands in my way.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.127
Black Wind and I rode alongside

13:55.210 --> 13:56.962
two rabbits
running side by side.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.506
I think one was a male,
one was a female.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.425
But you know,
you can't really tell

14:01.508 --> 14:03.051
when they're running that fast.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.263
When I go riding tomorrow,
I will try to find them again.

14:06.430 --> 14:07.574
Maybe they'll still be there.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.516
We have excellent news.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.269
The matchmaker has found you
an auspicious match.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.024
Yes, Mulan, it is decided.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.654
Come and sit down.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.456
It is what is best
for our family.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.759
Yes.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.847
It is best.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.893
I will bring honor to us all.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.226
I'm truly blessed
to be in the presence

15:57.291 --> 15:59.126
of such enchanting women.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.629
I have no doubt today will be
a momentous day for the Hua...

16:02.713 --> 16:05.507
Never mind that.
We must be on time.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.050
I'm starving.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.844
I already told you,
you cannot eat.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.053
It will ruin your makeup.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.182
The fiercest winter storm
could not destroy this makeup.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.019
Xiu, look at my face.
What am I feeling?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.812
I have no idea.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.314
Exactly.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.067
This is my sad face.
This is my curious face.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
And now I'm confused.

16:29.698 --> 16:30.949
Quiet.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.119
Composed.

16:35.746 --> 16:36.997
Graceful.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.917
Elegant.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.212
Poised.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.589
Polite.

16:47.591 --> 16:50.385
These are the qualities...

16:50.552 --> 16:53.430
we see in a good wife.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.267
These are the qualities...

16:58.352 --> 17:01.146
we see in Mulan.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.984
When a wife
serves her husband...

17:08.153 --> 17:10.989
she must be silent.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.410
She must be...

17:16.078 --> 17:17.329
invisible.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.707
She must be...

17:22.125 --> 17:23.544
Is something wrong?

17:24.503 --> 17:27.464
No, Madam Matchmaker.
Thank you.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.636
It's ideal for the teapot...

17:34.805 --> 17:38.684
to remain
in the center of the table.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.644
Yes, I understand.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.816
But I think the teapot
should remain where it is.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.026
Move the teapot.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.236
Girl!

18:39.369 --> 18:41.830
Dishonor to the Hua family.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.460
They have failed
to raise a good daughter.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.657
Citizens!

19:18.575 --> 19:22.829
Citizens, we are under attack
from Northern Invaders.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.542
Our land is at war.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.503
By edict
of His Imperial Majesty,

19:29.586 --> 19:31.129
the Son of Heaven...

19:31.755 --> 19:35.926
every family must contribute
one man to fight.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.388
One man from every house.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.724
Wáng family.

19:46.562 --> 19:47.688
Chin family.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.233
Dù family.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.403
Hua family.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.538
I am Hua Zhou.

20:05.122 --> 20:06.415
I served the Imperial Army

20:06.498 --> 20:09.042
in the last battle
against the Northern Invaders.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.421
Have you no son
old enough to fight?

20:14.882 --> 20:16.842
I am blessed with two daughters.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.136
I will fight.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.560
No.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.353
You will
only humiliate him further.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.022
Are you all right?
Can I help you?

20:30.105 --> 20:31.106
No.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.660
Liu family.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.123
Wei family.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.000
You're a war hero.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.631
You've already made
many great sacrifices.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.049
Are you suggesting...

20:58.926 --> 21:03.472
our family not comply
with the Imperial edict?

21:03.639 --> 21:05.098
But how can you fight...

21:08.644 --> 21:10.103
I am the father.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.189
It is my place to bring honor

21:12.272 --> 21:14.149
to our family
on the battlefield.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.943
You are the daughter!

21:18.195 --> 21:20.072
Learn your place.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.666
We must be strong.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.460
This time, he will not return.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.707
It's beautiful.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.375
Beautiful tool...

22:56.585 --> 22:58.253
for terrible work.

23:04.676 --> 23:05.677
The phoenix.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.474
You remember?

23:15.979 --> 23:18.607
She has followed me
into battle before,

23:18.690 --> 23:20.651
and she will follow me now.

23:25.113 --> 23:29.701
And she will tell our
ancestors I've been loyal...

23:30.369 --> 23:31.912
brave, and true.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.416
I wish I was as brave as you.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.544
There is no courage
without fear.

23:39.253 --> 23:40.295
But, Father...

23:40.379 --> 23:42.756
You must be courageous, Mulan.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.050
For your mother

23:46.218 --> 23:47.302
and your sister.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.850
For me.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.699
It is my duty to fight.

24:09.575 --> 24:12.035
My honor to sacrifice
for the emperor.

24:13.370 --> 24:16.290
If I were your son,
you wouldn't have to.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.756
I would change nothing
about my life.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.096
We should all get some rest.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.937
I'm leaving in the morning.

25:12.137 --> 25:16.558
"Loyal, brave, and true."

26:06.108 --> 26:07.150
My sword.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.570
My armor! It's gone!

26:10.612 --> 26:12.030
Who would do such a thing?

26:13.240 --> 26:15.033
The conscription scroll.

26:18.829 --> 26:19.913
It was Mulan.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.874
You must stop her.

26:21.957 --> 26:23.709
The Northern Invaders
will kill her!

26:23.792 --> 26:26.086
If I expose her lie,
our own people will kill her.

26:34.011 --> 26:37.222
Ancestors, honored phoenix...

26:38.265 --> 26:41.226
ancestral guardian,
I beseech you...

26:42.686 --> 26:44.938
watch over my daughter, Mulan.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.362
She has made a terrible mistake.

26:59.953 --> 27:03.582
I taught her too late
to know her place.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.418
I indulged her.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.922
She is innocent of the world.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.174
Of men.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.385
And the evils of war.

27:17.638 --> 27:21.016
And now she's in great danger.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.980
Please, honored phoenix...

27:28.398 --> 27:29.775
protect her.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.871
Our last apple.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.627
You need it more than I do.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.588
We should be there by now.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.050
Do you think we are lost?

28:39.136 --> 28:40.721
The phoenix.

29:03.493 --> 29:07.372
There were men gathering
from all over the kingdom.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.626
An alien
and savage tribe to her.

29:12.503 --> 29:17.966
To hide amongst them, she knew
she must become one of them.

29:24.473 --> 29:25.891
I'm Cricket.

29:26.558 --> 29:29.394
My mother says I was born
under an auspicious moon.

29:31.772 --> 29:34.483
That is why my mother says
I'm a good luck charm.

29:42.574 --> 29:45.744
Need a hand, little man?

29:48.997 --> 29:50.123
Insult me again,

29:50.207 --> 29:51.647
and you'll taste
the tip of my blade.

29:52.376 --> 29:54.044
- Lower your sword.
- Or what?

30:01.760 --> 30:03.220
I'm your commanding officer.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.056
Fighting will not be
tolerated. Am I clear?

30:06.139 --> 30:07.391
Yes, Commander.

30:08.392 --> 30:10.769
With your voice, soldier.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.021
Yes, Commander.

30:20.821 --> 30:22.197
What is your name?

30:24.032 --> 30:25.409
Hua Jun, Commander.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.786
Is this your family sword?

30:29.288 --> 30:31.498
It belongs to my father,
Hua Zhou.

30:36.503 --> 30:37.838
Fall in line.

30:58.859 --> 30:59.860
Sorry, Ling!

31:00.027 --> 31:01.904
Yao, give it back!
It's not funny!

31:04.823 --> 31:06.074
Po, catch!

31:09.703 --> 31:11.330
I told you to line up
for showers.

31:11.872 --> 31:13.665
- Showers?
- Showers.

31:13.749 --> 31:15.167
You lot stink.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.376
And I need a volunteer

31:16.460 --> 31:17.580
- for night guard duty.
- Me!

31:18.337 --> 31:21.465
I mean, I volunteer, sir.

33:20.792 --> 33:21.793
Stealing.

33:22.294 --> 33:24.630
Penalty, death.

33:25.172 --> 33:29.176
Desertion. Penalty, death.

33:29.718 --> 33:31.053
Bring women into camp

33:31.136 --> 33:33.764
or consorting with women
in any way.

33:33.931 --> 33:37.184
Penalty, death.

33:37.267 --> 33:40.771
Dishonesty.
Penalty...

33:44.107 --> 33:47.236
expulsion, disgrace.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.905
Disgrace for you,
disgrace for your family...

33:50.322 --> 33:55.035
disgrace for your village,
disgrace for your country.

33:55.619 --> 33:57.329
We're going to make men

33:57.412 --> 33:59.748
out of every single one of you.

34:31.905 --> 34:32.906
Fire!

34:36.743 --> 34:39.037
Only the strongest
will reach the summit.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.291
It will take
everything you have.

34:46.712 --> 34:47.963
Straighten out those arms.

34:49.298 --> 34:50.674
Keep them up. Shoulder level.

34:52.885 --> 34:54.386
Keep your mind strong.

34:55.637 --> 34:57.848
Don't stop.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.143
Is he crying?

35:16.408 --> 35:17.534
Fire!

35:20.662 --> 35:21.663
Fire!

35:31.298 --> 35:32.966
Give that back!

36:31.316 --> 36:33.026
Longwei!

36:33.110 --> 36:34.470
Report to the barracks
immediately.

36:35.904 --> 36:36.905
Immediately.

36:39.032 --> 36:43.078
Dishonesty.
Penalty, expulsion.

36:44.913 --> 36:46.248
Disgrace.

36:52.546 --> 36:54.131
We were matched 28 days ago.

36:54.965 --> 36:56.633
Her name is Li Li.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.095
Her skin is white as milk.

37:00.262 --> 37:03.390
Her fingers like the tender
white roots of a green onion.

37:03.473 --> 37:04.766
Ling is a romantic!

37:04.850 --> 37:06.768
Her eyes
are like morning dewdrops...

37:06.894 --> 37:09.855
I like my women buxom.

37:10.606 --> 37:12.065
With strong, wide hips.

37:12.149 --> 37:14.693
I like kissing women
with cherry red lips.

37:14.818 --> 37:15.879
I don't care
what she looks like.

37:15.903 --> 37:18.155
- I agree.
- I care what she cooks like.

37:20.699 --> 37:22.075
Tell us, Hua Jun.

37:22.242 --> 37:23.785
What's your ideal woman?

37:26.872 --> 37:30.209
My ideal woman is courageous.

37:30.292 --> 37:32.085
- A courageous woman?
- Yes.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.383
And she has a sense of humor.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.428
- She's also smart.
- Smart?

37:41.720 --> 37:42.822
Well, what does she look like?

37:42.846 --> 37:44.139
That's not the point.

37:44.348 --> 37:46.558
Courageous, funny, smart.

37:46.725 --> 37:48.185
Hua Jun's not describing
a woman...

37:49.394 --> 37:51.188
he's describing me.

37:51.271 --> 37:53.857
That's not you, Yao.
That's definitely not you.

37:56.193 --> 37:57.486
Not you.

38:00.197 --> 38:01.406
Not you.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.119
Hua Jun.

38:07.496 --> 38:08.914
Don't let them bother you.

38:09.081 --> 38:11.041
Especially that donkey Yao.

38:16.797 --> 38:19.341
Are you matched? Can I ask?

38:19.716 --> 38:20.801
No.

38:21.426 --> 38:24.429
I mean, yes. I was.

38:24.638 --> 38:26.682
Almost.

38:27.599 --> 38:28.809
Didn't work out.

38:30.269 --> 38:31.645
Lucky you.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.565
I mean, how do you
even begin to know

38:34.648 --> 38:35.816
how to talk to a woman...

38:35.983 --> 38:37.943
let alone be married to one?

38:40.571 --> 38:44.283
Just talk to her like
you are talking to me now.

38:44.533 --> 38:47.494
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

38:52.457 --> 38:53.834
What if she doesn't like me?

38:55.919 --> 38:56.920
She will.

39:00.674 --> 39:02.342
I mean,
I think she will, you know?

39:02.426 --> 39:04.094
You never know with women.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.902
You should really consider
skipping guard duty

39:13.937 --> 39:15.189
and taking a shower.

39:15.939 --> 39:17.566
You stink, my friend.

41:14.641 --> 41:15.976
You idiot.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.604
Now everyone sees it.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.480
You must hide your chi!

41:21.106 --> 41:22.482
Hua Jun!

41:23.400 --> 41:24.651
Who knew?

41:24.818 --> 41:26.111
What a killer!

41:29.198 --> 41:30.991
You reek, soldier.

41:31.742 --> 41:33.285
Have you even showered once yet?

41:34.077 --> 41:36.455
You smell bad.

42:30.092 --> 42:31.343
Hua Jun.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.303
I'm glad I found you.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.639
I see you're finally
getting clean.

42:35.806 --> 42:37.599
The Fifth Battalion thanks you.

42:39.768 --> 42:41.144
I came here to be alone.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.271
What was that today?

42:42.855 --> 42:44.314
It was incredible.

42:47.776 --> 42:50.028
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Why not?

42:56.618 --> 42:57.778
I can't believe all this time

42:57.828 --> 42:59.180
you've been keeping
your skill a secret.

42:59.204 --> 43:00.789
What else have you been hiding?

43:02.541 --> 43:03.584
Nothing.

43:04.084 --> 43:05.210
Leave me alone.

43:07.129 --> 43:09.214
Hua Jun, we started off
on the wrong foot.

43:10.048 --> 43:11.675
Can we be friends?

43:11.842 --> 43:13.552
I'm not your friend.

43:16.847 --> 43:18.056
Very well.

43:18.974 --> 43:20.058
But you are my equal.

43:20.726 --> 43:24.104
We fight together
against the same enemy.

43:24.271 --> 43:26.481
I will do all I can
to protect the others.

43:29.902 --> 43:31.820
You can turn your back on me...

43:32.404 --> 43:35.741
but when the time comes,
do not turn your back on them.

43:54.009 --> 43:55.427
I welcome the leaders

43:55.511 --> 43:57.638
of the 12 Rouran tribes...

43:57.804 --> 43:59.848
as we approach
the final victory.

44:00.057 --> 44:02.392
Soon the Imperial City
will be ours.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.394
But we're relying on a witch.

44:04.686 --> 44:06.104
Yes, a witch.

44:06.271 --> 44:07.397
A witch cannot be trusted!

44:07.564 --> 44:09.525
She is no threat.

44:10.067 --> 44:11.735
Hush! Enough!

44:12.861 --> 44:14.363
Make no mistake...

44:14.947 --> 44:18.075
the witch serves me
and therefore, all of us.

44:19.159 --> 44:20.619
She knows who her master is.

44:26.250 --> 44:28.126
Consider our future.

44:28.585 --> 44:30.045
This, my friends...

44:30.212 --> 44:33.131
is just a small taste
of what is to come.

44:33.298 --> 44:34.925
From the Imperial City ahead,

44:35.092 --> 44:37.553
riches will flow
like a mighty river.

44:37.719 --> 44:40.389
I don't care about riches.

44:47.020 --> 44:49.731
How much gold can a nomad carry?

44:55.028 --> 44:57.531
Then, I will give you revenge...

44:58.699 --> 45:01.243
for the land we lost
to the empire.

45:01.994 --> 45:03.829
For the shame of the last war.

45:03.996 --> 45:05.873
For my father,
who the emperor killed.

45:08.250 --> 45:09.751
If gold is not enough...

45:11.086 --> 45:13.088
I will give you blood.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.300
Sharpen your swords.

45:16.466 --> 45:17.885
Our time has come.

45:20.721 --> 45:23.223
Now I know.
I serve you.

45:23.891 --> 45:25.684
I am the slave.

45:25.851 --> 45:28.395
And you would
do well to remember it.

45:29.229 --> 45:32.566
Over there, witch.
The next garrison.

45:34.359 --> 45:35.360
Destroy it.

45:46.830 --> 45:47.831
Hua Jun.

45:48.540 --> 45:50.042
Report to Commander Tung.

46:09.144 --> 46:10.521
Hua Jun, Commander.

46:11.188 --> 46:12.314
Enter.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.366
Hua Jun.

46:29.581 --> 46:31.291
It seems you have been
hiding something.

46:34.253 --> 46:35.838
- Commander...
- I sensed it

46:35.921 --> 46:37.464
the moment I met you.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.842
But now I'm sure.

46:42.553 --> 46:44.471
You see,
I have a secret as well.

46:45.806 --> 46:47.099
I know your father.

46:47.975 --> 46:50.102
He was a great soldier.

46:50.269 --> 46:51.436
In you, Hua Jun...

46:51.937 --> 46:53.605
I see the shadow of his sword.

46:54.314 --> 46:57.025
Perhaps this shadow
falls heavy on your shoulders.

46:57.776 --> 47:00.070
You can't allow your father's
legacy to hold you back.

47:00.696 --> 47:02.823
You need to cultivate your gift.

47:03.490 --> 47:04.491
Sir.

47:04.658 --> 47:06.743
Your chi is powerful, Hua Jun.

47:07.286 --> 47:08.412
Why do you hide it?

47:16.128 --> 47:18.338
I... I don't know.

47:32.269 --> 47:33.854
The chi pervades the universe

47:33.937 --> 47:35.480
and all living things.

47:36.398 --> 47:38.567
We are all born with it.

47:41.570 --> 47:45.490
But only the most true will
connect deeply to his chi...

47:45.657 --> 47:47.492
and become a great warrior.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.039
Tranquil as a forest...

47:52.247 --> 47:54.082
but on fire within.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.509
The Rouran enemy is vast.

48:04.384 --> 48:06.762
They are ruthless
and unpredictable.

48:08.597 --> 48:10.432
Yet physical force

48:10.974 --> 48:12.684
need not be met
with equal force.

48:13.477 --> 48:16.772
The warrior yields to force
and redirects it.

48:18.482 --> 48:21.318
Disadvantage can be turned
into an advantage.

48:22.069 --> 48:25.656
Four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.012
The garrisons continue to fall

51:35.095 --> 51:36.597
to the Northern Invaders.

51:36.763 --> 51:38.599
We have been called to war,

51:38.682 --> 51:40.642
even though our training
is not finished.

51:41.143 --> 51:42.186
We leave to defend

51:42.269 --> 51:43.371
the Mountain-Steppe Garrison

51:43.395 --> 51:44.855
against the Rouran invader.

51:45.439 --> 51:48.775
Up until now, you've been
boys playing soldiers.

51:49.276 --> 51:51.653
Today, you become men.

51:53.488 --> 51:55.490
You will now take the oath
of the warrior...

51:55.657 --> 51:58.493
pledging fidelity to
the three pillars of virtue.

51:59.411 --> 52:01.038
The enemy possesses
none of these...

52:01.205 --> 52:03.665
and therefore can be defeated.

52:03.832 --> 52:07.044
Remember this when you
meet him on the battlefield.

52:07.711 --> 52:08.837
Draw sword!

52:11.715 --> 52:13.800
- Loyal.
- Loyal!

52:13.967 --> 52:15.469
- Brave.
- Brave!

52:16.220 --> 52:18.180
- True.
- True!

52:22.559 --> 52:24.186
Return swords!

52:26.980 --> 52:27.981
In!

52:52.005 --> 52:53.799
Commander Tung, it's Hua Jun.

52:53.882 --> 52:54.967
You may enter.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.768
Commander Tung,

53:04.852 --> 53:06.812
there's something that weighs
heavily on my heart.

53:06.937 --> 53:08.522
I need to confess it to you.

53:11.733 --> 53:13.443
It has to do
with the three virtues.

53:13.610 --> 53:16.280
There's no shame in being
fearful before battle.

53:17.865 --> 53:20.868
In fact, it's a testament
to your honesty...

53:21.034 --> 53:23.036
that you confess such doubt.

53:23.871 --> 53:26.123
Yes, Commander.
But the other virtues...

53:26.206 --> 53:27.624
Hua Jun.

53:29.960 --> 53:30.961
You're a good man.

53:32.921 --> 53:34.715
Perhaps one day
you could accompany me

53:34.798 --> 53:36.300
to my village...

53:36.466 --> 53:38.106
where I will introduce you
to my daughter.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.889
And our village matchmaker,
of course.

53:46.518 --> 53:49.104
Yes, Commander.
That's my great honor.

53:49.771 --> 53:51.648
I look forward
to seeing your father's face

53:52.316 --> 53:53.901
when you give him this news.

54:25.224 --> 54:26.892
The Fourth Battalion.

54:31.897 --> 54:34.107
This is the work of Böri Khan.

54:36.443 --> 54:37.945
There's no one left.

55:10.143 --> 55:12.020
The Mountain-Steppe
Garrison welcomes...

55:12.104 --> 55:15.065
the Fifth Battalion of
His Majesty's Imperial Army.

55:19.820 --> 55:20.946
Scouts at the gate!

55:30.163 --> 55:33.000
Böri Khan assembles not
a half day's ride from here.

55:33.166 --> 55:34.251
They prepare for battle.

55:34.418 --> 55:35.502
We're greatly outnumbered.

55:35.586 --> 55:36.837
Fortify for a siege!

55:36.920 --> 55:39.715
No. He who moves first
controls the enemy.

55:42.384 --> 55:43.677
We leave at first light.

55:48.140 --> 55:49.740
Anything you want me
to tell your mothers

55:49.766 --> 55:50.976
when you die?

55:51.476 --> 55:53.854
That's not funny.

55:54.521 --> 55:56.815
What's the matter? Scared?

55:57.816 --> 55:58.901
No.

55:59.776 --> 56:01.862
Who knows who will live
past tomorrow?

56:03.155 --> 56:05.199
We may never see
each other again.

56:08.243 --> 56:10.162
My father once said...

56:11.121 --> 56:13.040
"There is no courage
without fear."

56:13.207 --> 56:14.208
So?

56:15.250 --> 56:16.376
So this is natural.

56:16.460 --> 56:18.003
Well, it doesn't feel natural.

56:30.474 --> 56:33.143
Listen to me, all of you.

56:35.270 --> 56:36.522
We will live.

56:39.358 --> 56:40.859
I guarantee it.

56:42.945 --> 56:44.404
Because I will protect you.

56:45.364 --> 56:46.949
We'll protect each other.

56:47.574 --> 56:49.034
We'll fight for each other.

56:59.545 --> 57:00.671
Except for you, Yao.

57:01.213 --> 57:04.132
I might take the opportunity
to kill you myself.

58:27.633 --> 58:28.967
They've left the garrison.

58:29.051 --> 58:31.136
A bold move
that changes nothing.

58:31.303 --> 58:32.429
The plan continues.

58:33.305 --> 58:34.765
Charge!

58:42.564 --> 58:44.274
Spear men, open!

58:52.658 --> 58:54.326
Archers, ready!

58:56.745 --> 58:57.955
Raise!

59:28.777 --> 59:30.028
Release!

59:43.667 --> 59:45.836
The coward retreats!
Pursue them!

59:45.919 --> 59:47.713
Left flank! Charge!

1:01:57.217 --> 1:01:58.385
You're a witch.

1:01:58.468 --> 1:01:59.553
Am I?

1:01:59.636 --> 1:02:01.638
And who are you?

1:02:04.474 --> 1:02:05.976
I'm Hua Jun.

1:02:06.143 --> 1:02:08.687
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army.

1:02:16.069 --> 1:02:17.112
Liar.

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:22.284
Your deceit weakens you.

1:02:24.203 --> 1:02:26.330
It poisons your chi.

1:03:07.204 --> 1:03:08.539
I ask again...

1:03:09.623 --> 1:03:11.124
who are you?

1:03:11.667 --> 1:03:12.918
I'm Hua Jun.

1:03:13.085 --> 1:03:15.128
Soldier in the emperor's
Imperial Army!

1:03:15.629 --> 1:03:16.922
Then you will die

1:03:17.005 --> 1:03:18.841
pretending to be
something you're not.

1:03:45.659 --> 1:03:47.578
And Hua Jun did die.

1:03:51.623 --> 1:03:54.251
For a lie can only live so long.

1:03:58.213 --> 1:03:59.798
But Mulan...

1:04:02.301 --> 1:04:04.136
Mulan lived.

1:05:10.077 --> 1:05:11.245
"True."

1:06:36.538 --> 1:06:37.831
Witch!

1:06:37.998 --> 1:06:39.458
She's a witch!

1:06:56.683 --> 1:06:58.060
Defensive position!

1:07:03.857 --> 1:07:06.568
Don't run! We hold formation.

1:07:16.161 --> 1:07:17.162
Now!

1:07:24.336 --> 1:07:25.337
Fire!

1:07:30.759 --> 1:07:32.052
No!

1:07:33.804 --> 1:07:36.390
They're targeting us!
We're dead if we stay here!

1:08:15.679 --> 1:08:17.973
Enemy on the ridge!
Turn around!

1:08:18.807 --> 1:08:19.975
Fire! Fire!

1:08:25.397 --> 1:08:26.648
Turn it around!

1:08:26.732 --> 1:08:28.192
Move it! Move!

1:08:42.247 --> 1:08:43.248
Fire!

1:09:32.297 --> 1:09:33.298
Run!

1:09:47.688 --> 1:09:49.523
Cricket!

1:09:56.822 --> 1:09:59.074
Go! Go! Go!

1:10:06.915 --> 1:10:07.916
Honghui!

1:10:11.170 --> 1:10:12.171
Honghui!

1:11:36.296 --> 1:11:37.714
Gather yourselves.

1:11:38.590 --> 1:11:40.217
Find your comrades.

1:11:41.343 --> 1:11:43.303
The enemy has been defeated.

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:46.890
Sergeant Qiang, regroup the men.

1:11:47.057 --> 1:11:48.684
Has anyone seen Hua Jun?

1:12:00.070 --> 1:12:01.238
Have you seen Hua Jun?

1:12:07.244 --> 1:12:08.495
Hua Jun?

1:12:30.142 --> 1:12:31.685
I'm Hua Mulan.

1:12:35.898 --> 1:12:37.649
Forgive me.

1:12:44.531 --> 1:12:46.158
He's a girl?

1:12:48.076 --> 1:12:50.454
You are an imposter.

1:12:51.205 --> 1:12:52.706
You've betrayed the regiment.

1:12:53.582 --> 1:12:56.627
You've brought disgrace
to the Hua family.

1:12:57.419 --> 1:12:59.630
- Commander...
- Your deceit is my shame.

1:13:01.131 --> 1:13:02.466
Commander,

1:13:02.549 --> 1:13:04.469
what is the punishment
assigned to this imposter?

1:13:06.428 --> 1:13:07.513
Expulsion.

1:13:11.725 --> 1:13:14.019
I would rather be executed.

1:13:15.646 --> 1:13:17.481
From this moment forward,

1:13:17.564 --> 1:13:20.859
you are expelled from
the emperor's Imperial Army.

1:13:26.406 --> 1:13:28.617
If you show your face again...

1:13:28.784 --> 1:13:32.829
your wish to be executed
will be granted.

1:14:16.081 --> 1:14:17.958
You can never go home.

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:21.587
Your disgrace
is worse than death.

1:14:35.601 --> 1:14:37.477
I understand.

1:14:40.564 --> 1:14:45.402
I was a girl like you
when people turned on me.

1:14:50.324 --> 1:14:53.368
You don't think
I longed for a noble path?

1:14:56.663 --> 1:14:59.249
I've lived a life of exile.

1:15:00.042 --> 1:15:04.963
No country,
no village, no family.

1:15:08.884 --> 1:15:10.636
We are the same.

1:15:12.221 --> 1:15:13.972
- We're not.
- We are.

1:15:14.932 --> 1:15:18.310
The more power I showed,
the more I was crushed.

1:15:18.477 --> 1:15:20.854
Just like you.

1:15:21.939 --> 1:15:25.526
You saved them today
and still they turned on you.

1:15:26.485 --> 1:15:28.904
You are just at the beginning
of your power.

1:15:30.989 --> 1:15:32.366
Merge your path with mine.

1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:35.577
We will be stronger together.

1:15:38.747 --> 1:15:42.501
You follow a coward.
A leader who runs from battle.

1:15:42.668 --> 1:15:45.838
Böri Khan
did not run from battle.

1:15:46.755 --> 1:15:49.925
That coward
will take the Imperial City...

1:15:50.092 --> 1:15:52.219
and your emperor will fall.

1:15:54.847 --> 1:15:55.889
That can't happen.

1:15:56.056 --> 1:15:58.642
But it happens even now.

1:16:03.772 --> 1:16:05.107
Join me.

1:16:06.817 --> 1:16:09.319
We will take our place together.

1:16:17.744 --> 1:16:19.288
I know my place.

1:16:20.914 --> 1:16:22.749
And it is my duty...

1:16:23.375 --> 1:16:27.254
to fight for the kingdom
and protect the emperor.

1:16:54.031 --> 1:16:55.574
Commander Tung!

1:16:58.076 --> 1:16:59.244
What is the meaning of this?

1:16:59.411 --> 1:17:01.288
Commander Tung,
we must ride to the emperor.

1:17:01.371 --> 1:17:02.789
His life is in danger.

1:17:02.873 --> 1:17:04.875
The emperor's life
has never been safer.

1:17:05.042 --> 1:17:06.722
That's what Böri Khan
wants you to believe.

1:17:10.297 --> 1:17:12.090
Please,
you have to listen to me.

1:17:12.257 --> 1:17:14.885
Sergeant, hand me my sword.

1:17:20.390 --> 1:17:22.768
Kill me if you must.
But first, listen.

1:17:24.102 --> 1:17:26.480
The garrison attacks
were just a distraction.

1:17:27.731 --> 1:17:29.983
Khan has our army focused
on the Silk Road...

1:17:30.150 --> 1:17:31.630
so he can sneak
into the Imperial City

1:17:31.693 --> 1:17:33.195
and kill the emperor.

1:17:34.446 --> 1:17:36.323
Böri Khan is already far ahead.

1:17:36.406 --> 1:17:38.450
The Imperial Army
can't stop him now.

1:17:39.451 --> 1:17:43.038
But perhaps a small,
well-trained force could.

1:17:44.915 --> 1:17:46.750
When employed correctly...

1:17:49.169 --> 1:17:51.421
four ounces
can move 1,000 pounds.

1:17:54.508 --> 1:17:58.387
Only a foolish man listens to
someone whose very existence

1:17:58.470 --> 1:17:59.888
is a lie.

1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:08.647
You would believe Hua Jun.

1:18:08.814 --> 1:18:10.315
Why do you not believe
Hua Mulan?

1:18:11.358 --> 1:18:14.444
She risked everything by
revealing her true identity.

1:18:16.071 --> 1:18:18.240
She's braver than any man here.

1:18:20.450 --> 1:18:22.828
And she's the best warrior
amongst us.

1:18:26.456 --> 1:18:28.216
- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan.

1:18:28.375 --> 1:18:30.752
- I believe Hua Mulan.
- I believe Hua Mulan.

1:18:30.836 --> 1:18:31.920
I believe Hua Mulan.

1:18:32.004 --> 1:18:33.088
I believe Hua Mulan.

1:18:42.890 --> 1:18:43.974
Hua Mulan...

1:18:44.850 --> 1:18:47.227
your actions have brought
disgrace and dishonor

1:18:47.311 --> 1:18:48.687
to this regiment...

1:18:48.854 --> 1:18:52.065
to this kingdom
and to your own family.

1:18:54.026 --> 1:18:56.570
But your loyalty and bravery
are without question.

1:19:00.032 --> 1:19:02.492
You will lead us as we ride
to the Imperial City.

1:19:06.371 --> 1:19:07.539
Ready the horses.

1:20:25.534 --> 1:20:28.662
Your Majesty, a word.
In private.

1:20:31.248 --> 1:20:34.376
Despite the Rouran army's
crushing defeat...

1:20:34.543 --> 1:20:35.836
scouts have informed me

1:20:35.919 --> 1:20:37.838
that Böri Khan
has infiltrated the city.

1:20:37.921 --> 1:20:40.841
He assembles at the New Palace.

1:20:41.008 --> 1:20:43.343
He offers a duel.

1:20:43.510 --> 1:20:45.095
Prepare my guards.

1:20:45.262 --> 1:20:47.973
We ride to the site immediately.

1:20:48.807 --> 1:20:51.059
Your Majesty,
it is far too dangerous.

1:20:51.143 --> 1:20:52.269
Silence!

1:20:52.352 --> 1:20:54.521
My people have suffered enough.

1:20:54.688 --> 1:20:56.732
Now I must act.

1:20:56.899 --> 1:21:01.904
I will kill this Böri Khan
like I killed his father.

1:21:02.112 --> 1:21:03.780
With my own hands.

1:21:19.713 --> 1:21:21.798
Assemble all Imperial guardsmen

1:21:21.882 --> 1:21:23.634
immediately in this square.

1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:28.305
That includes every guard
on every tower and every gate.

1:21:28.472 --> 1:21:30.307
But who will protect the city?

1:21:31.683 --> 1:21:34.353
You question the judgement
of His Majesty the Emperor?

1:21:35.687 --> 1:21:38.857
Of course not, Chancellor.
I will see to it immediately.

1:22:02.881 --> 1:22:03.882
It's time.

1:22:18.105 --> 1:22:19.648
The gates are open!

1:22:19.815 --> 1:22:22.818
The streets are empty!
Why are there no guards?

1:22:45.340 --> 1:22:46.341
Ambush!

1:22:47.092 --> 1:22:48.093
Protect the emperor!

1:22:48.177 --> 1:22:49.344
Clear her path!

1:22:50.345 --> 1:22:52.598
Don't leave her side!
She must get through.

1:23:44.233 --> 1:23:46.610
Surely you didn't
expect a fair fight?

1:23:47.694 --> 1:23:50.155
How did you convince
my chancellor to betray me?

1:23:50.322 --> 1:23:52.074
That was not your chancellor.

1:23:52.449 --> 1:23:53.450
Now!

1:24:04.503 --> 1:24:07.089
Join the others.
Take the city.

1:24:07.256 --> 1:24:09.716
Kill every
last Imperial soldier.

1:24:20.936 --> 1:24:22.096
You need to find the emperor.

1:24:22.229 --> 1:24:23.856
We'll hold them back.

1:24:24.690 --> 1:24:26.275
Till next we meet, Honghui.

1:24:58.515 --> 1:25:00.350
Go! Go!

1:25:01.602 --> 1:25:02.603
Bolt the door.

1:25:04.521 --> 1:25:05.606
Bolt the door.

1:25:28.921 --> 1:25:32.341
Your Majesty, I'm Hua Mulan
from the Fifth Battalion.

1:25:32.508 --> 1:25:33.634
I've come to protect you.

1:25:35.135 --> 1:25:36.136
Impossible.

1:25:42.601 --> 1:25:45.896
A woman leading a man's army.

1:25:47.147 --> 1:25:48.315
Where's the emperor?

1:25:56.031 --> 1:25:57.491
You were right.

1:25:58.909 --> 1:26:00.160
We are the same.

1:26:00.327 --> 1:26:01.870
With one difference.

1:26:03.372 --> 1:26:07.417
They accept you,
but they will never accept me.

1:26:07.584 --> 1:26:09.837
You told me
my journey was impossible.

1:26:13.006 --> 1:26:14.716
Yet here I stand.

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:17.469
Proof that there is a place
for people like us.

1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:19.429
No.

1:26:23.642 --> 1:26:25.352
It's too late for me.

1:26:30.107 --> 1:26:32.359
You can still take
the noble path.

1:26:39.449 --> 1:26:41.076
It's not too late.

1:26:41.702 --> 1:26:42.953
Please.

1:26:45.330 --> 1:26:46.999
I need your help.

1:26:48.375 --> 1:26:49.585
Where's the emperor?

1:27:46.934 --> 1:27:48.769
They tell me
this palace is being built

1:27:48.852 --> 1:27:50.562
in honor of your father.

1:27:51.939 --> 1:27:54.191
And in honor of my father...

1:27:55.150 --> 1:27:58.237
this is where you will die.

1:28:00.822 --> 1:28:03.575
Or should I say "burn"?

1:28:05.869 --> 1:28:08.372
Who will come to save you,
Son of Heaven?

1:28:08.914 --> 1:28:10.624
Where are the sons
of the empire?

1:28:11.625 --> 1:28:12.876
I will tell you.

1:28:13.752 --> 1:28:17.381
Fallen to our swords.
Pierced by our arrows.

1:28:19.591 --> 1:28:21.885
Who will save you?

1:28:34.314 --> 1:28:35.357
Why are you here?

1:28:35.524 --> 1:28:38.777
The attack has met
a fierce resistance.

1:28:38.944 --> 1:28:40.571
- From who?
- A young woman...

1:28:40.737 --> 1:28:42.531
from a small village.

1:28:42.781 --> 1:28:44.408
A girl?

1:28:44.575 --> 1:28:46.410
A woman.

1:28:46.493 --> 1:28:47.536
A warrior.

1:28:50.956 --> 1:28:53.125
A woman leads the army.

1:28:53.959 --> 1:28:57.129
And she's no scorned dog.

1:28:59.214 --> 1:29:01.550
You led her here.

1:29:26.408 --> 1:29:28.493
Take your place...

1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:31.121
Mulan.

1:30:52.411 --> 1:30:56.415
The girl who has come
to save the dynasty.

1:31:26.570 --> 1:31:27.613
No!

1:31:44.421 --> 1:31:45.756
Rise up.

1:31:47.841 --> 1:31:49.843
You are a mighty warrior.

1:31:50.177 --> 1:31:52.304
Rise up like a phoenix.

1:31:53.639 --> 1:31:55.641
Fight for the kingdom
and its people.

1:34:39.596 --> 1:34:40.681
Stand up, soldier.

1:34:52.067 --> 1:34:53.277
Tell me your name.

1:35:24.558 --> 1:35:27.686
Your Imperial Highness,
Hua Mulan.

1:35:41.491 --> 1:35:45.412
Hua Mulan, the people owe you
a debt of thanks.

1:35:46.371 --> 1:35:48.373
I owe you my life.

1:35:49.666 --> 1:35:52.836
In gratitude for your service
and dedication...

1:35:53.003 --> 1:35:55.297
I invite you
to take your place...

1:35:55.380 --> 1:35:58.675
with our greatest
decorated warriors...

1:35:59.510 --> 1:36:03.013
as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.

1:36:05.015 --> 1:36:06.642
Your Majesty...

1:36:07.935 --> 1:36:11.063
I'm deeply honored by this
immeasurable invitation...

1:36:12.147 --> 1:36:14.149
but with humble apologies...

1:36:16.026 --> 1:36:17.778
I cannot accept it.

1:36:23.909 --> 1:36:28.372
I left home
under cover of darkness...

1:36:28.997 --> 1:36:31.500
and betrayed my family's trust.

1:36:33.669 --> 1:36:36.880
I made choices I knew
would risk their dishonor.

1:36:38.382 --> 1:36:39.424
Since then...

1:36:41.051 --> 1:36:42.427
I have pledged an oath...

1:36:42.970 --> 1:36:47.599
to be loyal, brave, and true.

1:36:51.395 --> 1:36:53.730
In order to fulfill this oath...

1:36:54.731 --> 1:37:00.237
I must return home
and make amends to my family.

1:37:01.989 --> 1:37:04.449
Very well, Hua Mulan.

1:37:08.662 --> 1:37:12.916
Devotion to family
is an essential virtue.

1:37:28.265 --> 1:37:29.266
You can't leave.

1:37:37.316 --> 1:37:39.151
The emperor
gives his permission...

1:37:39.318 --> 1:37:40.611
but you do not?

1:37:43.197 --> 1:37:44.406
We've not yet said goodbye.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:53.207
Goodbye, Honghui.

1:38:01.965 --> 1:38:03.675
You still won't take my hand?

1:38:21.902 --> 1:38:23.737
I will see you again, Hua Mulan.

1:38:54.935 --> 1:38:55.936
Mulan has returned!

1:38:56.019 --> 1:38:57.563
Mulan!

1:38:59.857 --> 1:39:00.983
Mulan?

1:39:02.693 --> 1:39:03.694
Mother!

1:39:04.528 --> 1:39:05.529
Mulan!

1:39:47.154 --> 1:39:49.364
There is so much
I have to ask you.

1:39:49.489 --> 1:39:50.741
Tell me about you first.

1:39:50.866 --> 1:39:52.492
I... I am matched!

1:39:52.576 --> 1:39:53.702
What's he like?

1:39:53.785 --> 1:39:55.329
He's handsome, a little shy,

1:39:55.412 --> 1:39:56.472
but he's not afraid of spiders.

1:39:56.496 --> 1:39:57.831
- Mulan!
- I'm so happy for you.

1:40:27.277 --> 1:40:29.154
Forgive me, Father.

1:40:32.950 --> 1:40:35.118
I stole your horse...

1:40:35.244 --> 1:40:39.164
I stole your sword,
I stole your armor.

1:40:41.792 --> 1:40:44.711
And the sword... I lost it.

1:40:46.797 --> 1:40:48.507
The sword is gone.

1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:52.344
Now I understand...

1:40:53.929 --> 1:40:56.223
how much that sword
means to you.

1:41:01.687 --> 1:41:06.316
It is my daughter
that means everything to me.

1:41:09.444 --> 1:41:13.615
And it is I should apologize.

1:41:16.952 --> 1:41:19.830
My foolish pride drove you away.

1:41:31.466 --> 1:41:33.635
One warrior knows another.

1:41:35.637 --> 1:41:38.390
You were always there...

1:41:38.473 --> 1:41:41.393
yet I see you
for the first time.

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:16.637
Hello, old friend.

1:42:21.141 --> 1:42:22.392
Tung Yong...

1:42:23.185 --> 1:42:26.605
I am honored to receive you
and the Emperor's Guard.

1:42:27.523 --> 1:42:30.567
But if you are here
to discipline Mulan...

1:42:31.318 --> 1:42:33.028
you have to get past me.

1:42:33.987 --> 1:42:35.989
I do not believe
that will be necessary.

1:42:39.535 --> 1:42:40.536
Under order

1:42:40.619 --> 1:42:42.829
of His Imperial Majesty
the Emperor,

1:42:43.038 --> 1:42:46.208
we present this gift
to Hua Mulan.

1:42:47.668 --> 1:42:49.503
She has saved the dynasty.

1:42:50.879 --> 1:42:53.382
The entire kingdom
is in her debt.

1:43:04.852 --> 1:43:06.228
She has brought honor

1:43:06.353 --> 1:43:08.272
to her ancestors...

1:43:08.438 --> 1:43:11.441
to her family, to her village...

1:43:12.609 --> 1:43:14.361
and to her country.

1:43:14.528 --> 1:43:16.029
As befits a great warrior...

1:43:16.196 --> 1:43:18.036
the sword is marked
with the pillars of virtue.

1:43:18.782 --> 1:43:23.495
Loyal, brave, true.

1:43:30.711 --> 1:43:32.629
And what is this fourth virtue
I see?

1:43:32.796 --> 1:43:34.173
Read it aloud, Mulan.

1:43:35.841 --> 1:43:37.426
"Devotion to family."

1:43:38.927 --> 1:43:40.512
You have brought honor
to us all.

1:43:40.679 --> 1:43:41.889
The emperor urges you

1:43:41.972 --> 1:43:43.932
to reconsider his invitation

1:43:44.099 --> 1:43:46.518
to join our greatest
decorated warriors...

1:43:47.186 --> 1:43:49.771
as an officer
in the Emperor's Guard.

1:43:54.401 --> 1:43:56.361
He awaits your decision.

1:44:11.335 --> 1:44:14.129
The green shoot
has grown up to the sky...

1:44:15.380 --> 1:44:17.549
and her ancestors celebrate her

1:44:17.633 --> 1:44:19.343
in the vault of the heavens.

1:44:22.721 --> 1:44:24.806
The girl became a soldier.

1:44:25.557 --> 1:44:27.184
The soldier became a leader.

1:44:28.894 --> 1:44:30.646
And the leader...

1:44:31.605 --> 1:44:33.482
became a legend.

1:44:54.336 --> 1:44:56.839
War is not freedom

1:44:56.922 --> 1:44:59.341
Over my shoulder

1:44:59.424 --> 1:45:02.636
I see a clearer view

1:45:04.471 --> 1:45:06.932
All for my family

1:45:07.015 --> 1:45:09.476
Reason I'm breathing

1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:12.896
Everything to lose

1:45:14.106 --> 1:45:18.318
Should I ask myself in the water

1:45:19.069 --> 1:45:22.739
What a warrior would do?

1:45:24.074 --> 1:45:28.453
Tell me underneath my armor

1:45:29.204 --> 1:45:32.875
Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1:45:34.251 --> 1:45:38.046
Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1:45:49.766 --> 1:45:52.269
Losing is easy

1:45:52.352 --> 1:45:54.813
Winning takes bravery

1:45:54.897 --> 1:45:58.192
I am a tiger's fool

1:45:59.776 --> 1:46:02.321
Out in the open

1:46:02.404 --> 1:46:04.781
No one to save me

1:46:04.865 --> 1:46:08.493
The kindest of whispers
are cruel

1:46:09.453 --> 1:46:13.749
Should I ask myself in the water

1:46:14.499 --> 1:46:18.128
What a warrior would do?

1:46:19.588 --> 1:46:23.759
Tell me underneath my armor

1:46:24.676 --> 1:46:28.472
Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1:46:29.598 --> 1:46:33.644
Am I loyal, brave, and true?

1:46:33.727 --> 1:46:36.271
Cold is the morning

1:46:36.355 --> 1:46:38.774
Warm is the dream

1:46:38.857 --> 1:46:41.276
Chasing the answers

1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:43.946
'Til I can't sleep

1:46:44.029 --> 1:46:46.240
Will I be stronger

1:46:46.323 --> 1:46:48.700
Or will I be weak

1:46:48.784 --> 1:46:52.871
When you're not with me?

1:46:54.915 --> 1:46:58.961
Who am I without my armor

1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:03.924
Standing in my father's shoes?

1:47:05.008 --> 1:47:09.304
All I know is that it's harder

1:47:10.264 --> 1:47:15.853
To be loyal, brave, and true

1:47:31.493 --> 1:47:33.787
Look at me

1:47:33.871 --> 1:47:36.331
You may think you see

1:47:36.415 --> 1:47:39.001
Who I really am

1:47:39.084 --> 1:47:41.587
But you'll never know me

1:47:41.670 --> 1:47:43.964
Every day

1:47:44.047 --> 1:47:49.094
It's as if I play a part

1:47:49.178 --> 1:47:51.221
Now I see

1:47:51.305 --> 1:47:53.807
If I wear a mask

1:47:53.891 --> 1:47:56.518
I can fool the world

1:47:56.602 --> 1:48:01.315
But I cannot fool my heart

1:48:04.109 --> 1:48:08.947
Who is that girl I see

1:48:09.031 --> 1:48:14.077
Staring straight back at me?

1:48:14.161 --> 1:48:19.208
When will my reflection show

1:48:19.625 --> 1:48:26.256
Who I am inside?

1:48:26.340 --> 1:48:28.842
I am now

1:48:28.926 --> 1:48:34.014
In a world
where I have to hide my heart

1:48:34.097 --> 1:48:36.600
And what I believe in

1:48:36.683 --> 1:48:38.727
But somehow

1:48:38.810 --> 1:48:43.982
I will show the world
what's inside my heart

1:48:44.066 --> 1:48:49.029
And be loved for who I am

1:48:51.657 --> 1:48:56.703
Who is that girl I see

1:48:56.787 --> 1:49:01.542
Staring straight back at me?

1:49:01.625 --> 1:49:06.755
Why is my reflection someone

1:49:06.839 --> 1:49:11.051
I don't know?

1:49:11.718 --> 1:49:14.888
Must I pretend

1:49:14.972 --> 1:49:21.520
That I'm someone else
for all time?

1:49:21.603 --> 1:49:26.692
When will my reflection show

1:49:27.067 --> 1:49:31.113
Who I am inside?

1:49:31.196 --> 1:49:35.701
There's a heart
that must be free

1:49:35.784 --> 1:49:38.537
To fly

1:49:38.954 --> 1:49:43.876
That burns with a need to know

1:49:43.959 --> 1:49:49.256
The reason why

1:49:49.339 --> 1:49:54.511
Why must we all conceal

1:49:54.636 --> 1:49:59.266
What we think, how we feel?

1:49:59.349 --> 1:50:03.979
Must there be a secret me

1:50:04.062 --> 1:50:09.193
I'm forced to hide?

1:50:09.276 --> 1:50:14.531
I won't pretend that I'm

1:50:14.615 --> 1:50:19.203
Someone else for all time

1:50:19.286 --> 1:50:24.666
When will my reflection show

1:50:24.750 --> 1:50:31.715
Who I am inside?

1:50:36.803 --> 1:50:42.684
When will my reflection show

1:50:43.685 --> 1:50:50.651
Who I am inside?
