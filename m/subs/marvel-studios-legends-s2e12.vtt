00:02.419 --> 00:04.421
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:32.157 --> 00:33.908
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE: The Skrull expansion

00:33.992 --> 00:37.162
has threatened our civilization
for centuries.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.165
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

00:40.248 --> 00:42.250
then take over our planets.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.049
YON-ROGG: The Skrull general, Talos,
has sent kill units...

00:49.132 --> 00:50.717
Skrulls!

00:52.802 --> 00:53.803
(GROANS)

00:55.055 --> 00:57.223
How about I tell you my secret...

00:58.516 --> 01:00.477
when you've told me yours?

01:00.560 --> 01:04.939
Do we have any information
we can act on?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.233
Oh!

01:08.026 --> 01:09.110
That did something.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.030
Uh-oh!

01:14.032 --> 01:15.492
-What do you want?
-(CRACKLING)

01:15.575 --> 01:18.578
We're looking for the location
of a light-speed engine.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.957
Track the pod.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.168
Find the girl.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.045
She knows more than she knows.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.090
Hey.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.925
This one's taken.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.052
Excuse me, miss.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.054
How long you plan to be in town?

01:36.387 --> 01:39.015
Oh, I'll be out of your hair
as soon as I track down the Skrulls

01:39.099 --> 01:40.600
that are infiltrating your planet.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.935
FURY: Skrulls?

01:42.018 --> 01:43.019
Shapeshifters?

01:43.436 --> 01:46.314
They can transform into any life-form
down to the DNA.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.279
And the woman said that there were more?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.532
FURY: The word she used
was "infiltration."

01:55.949 --> 01:57.367
We can't trust anyone.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.285
Not even our own men.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.870
TALOS: I just need your help...

02:00.954 --> 02:02.872
Your people are terrorists.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.125
My people lived as refugees...

02:05.375 --> 02:08.294
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

02:08.419 --> 02:10.213
and they destroyed our planet.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.007
Unless you help us...

02:13.091 --> 02:17.220
find the light-speed ship
capable of carrying us to safety,

02:17.303 --> 02:20.932
the handful of us that are left
will be slaughtered...

02:21.808 --> 02:23.226
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE: Thanks to you...

02:23.309 --> 02:27.313
those insidious shapeshifters
will threaten our borders no more.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.482
The Skrulls are just fighting
for a home.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.695
You're talking about destroying them
because they won't submit to your rule.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.779
And neither will I.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.492
TALOS: Onto the ship! Let's go!

02:42.120 --> 02:43.454
-(GRUNTS)
-(SOREN SCREAMS)

02:45.165 --> 02:46.332
You all right, friend?

02:46.416 --> 02:48.084
(WEAKLY) Never better.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.628
This is just the beginning.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.591
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

02:55.508 --> 02:57.886
scattered throughout the galaxy.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.767
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.
