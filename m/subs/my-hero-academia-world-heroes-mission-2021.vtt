00:33.950 --> 00:38.620
Why were supernatural
meta powers--or Quirks--

00:38.800 --> 00:41.150
introduced into the
human race in the past?

00:42.570 --> 00:47.510
Why was the first metahuman--the
Shining Baby-born into this world?

00:48.260 --> 00:50.800
It is all a tragedy.

00:50.800 --> 00:57.770
Quirks are not a blessing for
humanity but the beginning of the end.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.800
As it is written in the
Quirk Doomsday Theory,

01:03.240 --> 01:07.150
as generations pass,
Quirks mix and evolve

01:07.510 --> 01:11.730
until eventually,
no one can control them anymore.

01:12.350 --> 01:17.150
In these times,
where 80% of humanity is sick with Quirks,

01:17.150 --> 01:20.260
the remaining 20%
who are pure humans

01:20.260 --> 01:24.620
will also have relations with Quirk
holders, decreasing their numbers

01:24.620 --> 01:28.660
Extinction is in
front of our eyes.

01:29.680 --> 01:35.460
We, Humarise,
must take action now.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.600
Even if it means we
dye the earth with blood...

01:40.440 --> 01:42.480
For the salvation of humanity!

01:42.840 --> 01:47.680
For the salvation of humanity!
For the salvation of humanity!

01:47.680 --> 01:50.040
For the salvation of humanity!

01:57.820 --> 02:00.970
Now, let us begin

03:28.750 --> 03:32.930
You do not have a Quirk then?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.950
Congratulations.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.640
You have been saved

03:51.860 --> 03:54.810
"Otheon"

03:56.260 --> 03:59.730
The group claiming responsibility
for the terrorist attack the other day

03:59.730 --> 04:01.200
is Humarise...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.910
...an ideological group
founded by Flect Turn

04:03.910 --> 04:08.000
their leader who advocates
for the salvation of humanity.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The device used in the attack

04:10.000 --> 04:12.530
has been conjectured
to strengthen

04:12.530 --> 04:16.310
the Quirk factor triggering substance,
Ideotrigger.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.399
The device will hereafter
be called the Trigger Bomb.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.060
The mission of our
all-star hero team

04:23.060 --> 04:26.970
is to search all 25 of Humarise's
branches around the world at once

04:27.770 --> 04:28.000
After restraining their members,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.680
"Egypt"
After restraining their members,

04:29.680 --> 04:30.260
collect the Trigger Bomb held at
that location as soon as possible
"Egypt"

04:30.260 --> 04:34.930
collect the Trigger Bomb held at
that location as soon as possible

04:35.370 --> 04:38.660
We expect the members
at their facilities to resist

04:38.660 --> 04:41.540
There is also the danger that
they will use the Trigger Bomb,

04:41.550 --> 04:42.100
so we must refrain from asking
for help from local law enforcement

04:42.100 --> 04:44.220
"America"
so we must refrain from asking
for help from local law enforcement

04:44.220 --> 04:45.600
so we must refrain from asking
for help from local law enforcement

04:45.600 --> 04:49.510
I would like you to carry out this
mission promptly and with urgency

04:50.040 --> 04:51.150
All Might.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.260
Heroes, the success of failure of
this mission rests on your shoulders.

04:58.620 --> 05:02.400
Let's get back the smiles of
those living in fear of terrorism!

05:18.310 --> 05:19.910
Hero teams,

05:19.910 --> 05:22.080
star your missions!

05:22.400 --> 05:27.020
Team A, we're going to collect the
Trigger Bomb before it can be set off!

05:27.020 --> 05:28.080
Roger!

05:28.080 --> 05:31.150
Is that it?
Humarise's Otheon headquaters...

05:31.330 --> 05:34.400
The mission of those of us in
Team B is to gain control of the facility

05:34.660 --> 05:36.480
and capture their leader, Flect

05:36.840 --> 05:38.080
Don't let your guard down.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.530
Who do you think you're talking to? Huh?!

05:47.640 --> 05:49.510
- Stop!
- You can't come in without permission!!

05:49.510 --> 05:51.770
If you resist, I won't go easy on you!

05:52.170 --> 05:54.530
Clair, look for the Trigger Bomb!

05:54.530 --> 05:55.540
Got it.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.420
Voyance!

05:57.420 --> 05:59.420
English Subtitle by ZORO.to

06:01.910 --> 06:04.170
I can't believe they're using Quirks here..!

06:06.000 --> 06:08.770
Bakugo, most of their members are Quirkless!

06:08.770 --> 06:09.800
Don't be too rough..

06:09.910 --> 06:11.450
I know!

06:11.650 --> 06:14.510
Stun Grenade...!

06:33.050 --> 06:34.280
Endeavor, something's strange

06:34.280 --> 06:35.650
I don't see it anywhere!

06:35.650 --> 06:36.910
What did you say?!

06:37.650 --> 06:38.940
Team B, What about Flect?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.280
We'll be through shortly!

06:40.280 --> 06:42.940
Once you've captured him, get him
to tell you where the Trigger Bomb is!

06:42.940 --> 06:44.140
Roger!

06:44.140 --> 06:46.140
In that room is Flect Turn...

06:52.450 --> 06:53.620
Damn it!

06:53.620 --> 06:56.420
Their leaderis gone! Search the premises!

07:01.220 --> 07:01.800
In the end,

07:01.800 --> 07:02.220
''Humarise France Branch''
In the end,

07:02.220 --> 07:02.510
''Humarise France Branch''

07:02.510 --> 07:04.000
even after searching all of the
Humarise buildings around the world,
''Humarise France Branch''

07:04.000 --> 07:05.970
even after searching all of the
Humarise buildings around the world,

07:05.970 --> 07:08.570
we could not find any Trigger Bombs.

07:08.570 --> 07:09.450
''Humarise America Branch''

07:09.450 --> 07:10.090
Yes, we interrogated
The m embers we captured,
''Humarise America Branch''

07:10.090 --> 07:12.800
Yes, we interrogated
The m embers we captured,

07:12.800 --> 07:16.620
but no one knows where the
Trigger Bomb is being kept.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.020
In fact, they didn't even konw it existed.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.020
"Humarise Singapore Branch''
In fact, they didn't even konw it existed.

07:19.020 --> 07:19.370
In fact, they didn't even konw it existed.

07:19.850 --> 07:22.400
It sounds like it's the same for members
from the other branches, too.

07:22.570 --> 07:22.710
There's a high likelihood
that the terrorist attack

07:22.710 --> 07:24.280
''All-Star World Heroes'Team General HQ''
There's a high likelihood
that the terrorist attack

07:24.280 --> 07:27.800
was carried out by those under the direct
control of Humarise leader Flect Turn.
''All-Star World Heroes'Team General HQ''

07:27.800 --> 07:31.250
was carried out by those under the direct
control of Humarise leader Flect Turn.

07:31.740 --> 07:32.800
Director,

07:33.510 --> 07:36.220
there might be another facility
that we don't know about...

07:36.220 --> 07:41.140
Did they guess what we would do and
move the Trigger Bomb ahead of time...?

07:42.110 --> 07:44.140
All teams stand by in
your respective countries.

07:44.140 --> 07:46.140
Request more heroes

07:46.140 --> 07:49.020
and find Humarise's secret base!

07:53.650 --> 07:55.220
I have to deliver this...

07:55.970 --> 07:57.220
At this rate,

07:57.220 --> 07:59.740
the world will be destroyed...!

09:30.020 --> 09:32.800
''Otheon Airport''

09:42.080 --> 09:45.370
Roro, Lala, I need to go to work soon.

09:45.540 --> 09:46.600
Make sure you guys...

09:46.600 --> 09:48.910
We'll study!

09:50.140 --> 09:52.400
And if I don't come home till late?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.140
We'll make food!

09:56.220 --> 10:00.600
And, if someone weird
tries to talk to you...?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.820
We'll definitely ignore them!

10:03.280 --> 10:05.480
--Good!
--Good!

10:06.740 --> 10:09.600
But I don't think I'll be that late today.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.770
Yay!

10:13.110 --> 10:14.450
Pino!

10:15.770 --> 10:17.310
Okay, I'm off then.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.970
Have a good day!

10:41.310 --> 10:43.250
Old man, you got work for me?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.140
Pickup's on East 3rd Street.

10:53.340 --> 10:57.020
It needs to be delivered to
the Chinese restaurant in the South Grove.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.880
How much will I get for it...?

10:59.740 --> 11:02.200
Hah, like you're in a position to negotiate.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.910
Just do it for the asking price.

11:06.370 --> 11:09.620
Okay, okay, I get it.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.110
Hey, that's my bike!

11:17.110 --> 11:18.680
It's stolen, anyway, right?

11:18.680 --> 11:20.940
I'll give it back to its owner later!

11:22.370 --> 11:24.970
Just do whatever you want, damn kid!

11:25.370 --> 11:27.340
Now, time for work!

11:39.020 --> 11:41.770
It's so lively here.

11:42.140 --> 11:44.650
That's because it's
the biggest city in Otheon.

11:45.570 --> 11:51.740
I don't care if we're standing by or what,
but why do I have to run errands?!

11:51.740 --> 11:54.140
We're the lowest ranking on our team.

11:54.140 --> 11:54.880
Huh?!

11:55.620 --> 11:57.970
The only reason we're
on the World Heroes' Team

11:58.050 --> 12:01.020
is because we're doing our
work studies at Endeavor Agency.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.200
We're like freebies
that were just thrown in.

12:03.970 --> 12:06.510
But since we're on the team,

12:06.510 --> 12:09.140
we need to protect everyone from
terrorism with everything we've got.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.770
The ideological organization, Humarise...

12:11.770 --> 12:15.220
The damn organization that's
obsessed with a damn delusion...

12:15.220 --> 12:17.820
What the hell's with the
Quirk Doomsday Theory?

12:17.820 --> 12:22.280
They're taking a cock-and-bull-story
with no basis in truth seriously.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.800
It's a jewelry thief!

12:26.800 --> 12:29.080
Catch him!

12:29.080 --> 12:30.280
Damn it, it's a hero!

12:30.280 --> 12:31.570
See you at the usual place!

12:31.570 --> 12:33.340
I'm leaving the case to you!

12:34.570 --> 12:35.770
You bastards go to the right!

12:35.770 --> 12:36.710
Got it!

12:37.140 --> 12:39.910
Move! Move! I said move!

12:41.770 --> 12:43.080
Blackwhip!

12:43.420 --> 12:44.940
Todoroki, get the thief!

12:44.940 --> 12:46.050
Leave it to me!

12:55.940 --> 12:56.970
Serves you right.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.970
That was a pathetic blast!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.370
I'll show you a real one!

13:12.020 --> 13:13.480
This is taking too long.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.880
It better not have been a fake lead...

13:18.170 --> 13:19.400
Here!

13:20.370 --> 13:21.570
Wh-What?!

13:29.080 --> 13:31.170
That doesn't work on me!

13:32.570 --> 13:34.400
That took longer than expected...

13:36.340 --> 13:37.510
Todoroki!

13:37.510 --> 13:39.510
Midoriya, he doesn't have the case!

13:39.820 --> 13:41.740
Did he throw it away somewhere?

13:45.910 --> 13:47.450
They're working with someone!

14:03.740 --> 14:04.450
There!

14:18.620 --> 14:20.140
Too bad!

14:26.250 --> 14:28.170
He's already over there!

14:31.480 --> 14:33.340
I can't shake him...

14:38.620 --> 14:39.740
Blackwhip!

14:47.820 --> 14:49.620
In that case...

14:52.370 --> 14:53.850
How are you doing?

15:05.620 --> 15:06.820
Thank you!

15:07.420 --> 15:09.710
He couldn't have gotten that far yet!

15:10.650 --> 15:15.420
It's a million years to early
for you to catch me!

15:50.170 --> 15:51.600
Wait!

15:54.970 --> 15:55.910
An accident?!

15:56.020 --> 15:56.770
Midoriya!

15:56.770 --> 15:58.770
I'll take care of that!

15:58.770 --> 16:00.450
Thanks!

16:02.710 --> 16:04.710
It's okay...

16:08.280 --> 16:09.620
I'm going to be late

16:13.850 --> 16:15.170
- Shoot!
- Wait!

16:21.510 --> 16:23.450
Wait... wait... wait!

16:27.140 --> 16:29.650
What a terrible day...

16:31.140 --> 16:35.310
Aw man, my best clothes are ruined.

16:35.910 --> 16:39.140
It's all that hero's fault...

16:40.570 --> 16:44.050
Wait, was there a hero like
that working in this jurisdiction?

16:44.510 --> 16:47.200
Oh, well, it's not like
I'll ever see him again...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.220
Why did you come after me?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.850
Why did you run?

17:02.850 --> 17:05.280
I was in a hurry because of work.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.569
What kind of work?

17:06.569 --> 17:08.569
Business discussions.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.020
Despite how i look,
I'm a skilled salesman, you know.

17:12.020 --> 17:15.450
Can you please not get
in the way of my work?

17:15.819 --> 17:19.480
Will you show me what's inside that case?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.220
How much will you give me?

17:22.940 --> 17:26.619
If you want something, it's only natural that you pay for it.

17:27.170 --> 17:29.080
I just want to check its contents

17:29.080 --> 17:32.220
You're not a hero from
this country, are you?

17:34.540 --> 17:38.110
Is it really okay for you to do hero work
in a foreign country without permission?

17:38.110 --> 17:39.620
W-Well...

17:39.620 --> 17:43.540
You've got no authority here.
Can you please stop giving me orders?

17:43.540 --> 17:49.510
Or should I tell the police that I was
chased and interrogated for no reason?

17:50.050 --> 17:52.140
Maybe I will...

17:54.480 --> 17:56.740
I'm glad you understand

17:56.740 --> 18:01.020
If you want to do hero work so badly,
you should do it in your own country

18:01.020 --> 18:02.020
Later.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.170
Wait!

18:05.220 --> 18:06.850
What now?

18:06.850 --> 18:09.370
I just want to see what's in the case.

18:10.050 --> 18:12.310
If you want to see, then pay me.

18:12.310 --> 18:14.310
I will, so show me.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.080
That'll be 100,000  euros.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.570
That's too much!

18:18.880 --> 18:20.280
Then let go!

18:20.280 --> 18:21.510
Just a peek!

18:23.310 --> 18:24.800
Cut it out!

18:35.000 --> 18:35.850
Huh?

18:38.220 --> 18:39.540
Where's the jewelry..?

18:44.680 --> 18:46.080
Good work.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.340
Hey, some over here for a sec!

18:49.110 --> 18:50.850
Take a look at this.

18:50.850 --> 18:52.850
What's with all these holes...?

18:52.850 --> 18:54.140
They're...

19:11.820 --> 19:14.370
I see. Very well...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.910
We will take measures, as well.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.080
Please continue tracking.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.570
Thank you very much.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.000
Don't forget, Beros...

19:23.200 --> 19:26.910
The only atonement for those
possessed by the demon of sickness

19:26.910 --> 19:31.370
is to participate in the
salvation of innocent humans.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.420
I understand.

19:35.910 --> 19:39.600
I am so deeply sorry!

19:40.680 --> 19:44.400
Wow... Is this what they
call a "Japanese Dogeza"?

19:45.480 --> 19:48.080
Well, I'm just glad you
don't suspect me anymore.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.910
I mean, I'm sure heroes make
mistakes sometimes, too, right?

19:52.910 --> 19:54.940
Hey, wait, What's going on?!

19:54.940 --> 19:56.710
This isn't what was
supposed to be in the case!

19:56.710 --> 19:58.710
Wasn't it supposed to have jewelry?!

20:00.110 --> 20:01.650
Don't tell me back then...

20:04.250 --> 20:06.770
I took the wrong case?!

20:09.970 --> 20:13.250
A-any way. I don't have time for this,
so I'll be on my way now...

20:13.250 --> 20:14.770
You're sweating so much!

20:14.770 --> 20:16.000
Are you okay?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.820
Shoot, I need to hurry up
and get back there.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.620
but will the case even be there?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.600
If some one picked it up
and looked at what was inside,

20:22.600 --> 20:24.850
Thay would have definitely pocketed it!

20:24.850 --> 20:26.280
I'm dealing with villains here.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.620
"Oop, I lost it" isn't goona cut in.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.740
What'll I do? What am I goona do?!

20:31.740 --> 20:33.340
Um...

20:33.600 --> 20:35.420
Are you really all right?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.020
Huh?

20:36.900 --> 20:37.970
I'm fine.

20:38.170 --> 20:38.920
Oh, but...

20:43.970 --> 20:45.220
The police?

20:45.220 --> 20:45.950
Why?

20:46.900 --> 20:49.020
They're too prepared!

20:50.020 --> 20:51.900
Put your hands up and kneel over there!

20:53.500 --> 20:54.870
I... I...

20:54.870 --> 20:56.770
Please wait a minute! He's...

20:56.770 --> 20:58.820
I... didn't steal anything!

20:58.820 --> 20:59.520
Stop!

20:59.520 --> 21:00.800
We have permission to shoot!

21:00.800 --> 21:01.520
Fire!

21:04.550 --> 21:07.100
Face forward! Grit your teeth!

21:45.670 --> 21:47.750
Why would they suddenly fire like that ...?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.650
I thought...I was going to die

22:05.650 --> 22:06.850
They came after us?!

22:26.270 --> 22:27.970
Other people might
get caught up in it here!

22:27.970 --> 22:29.970
They're coming after us!

22:44.670 --> 22:45.520
Shoot..

22:57.520 --> 22:59.850
We need to get away from here!

23:11.670 --> 23:11.750
"Otheon Team Standby Hotel"

23:11.750 --> 23:12.700
Idiots!
"Otheon Team Standby Hotel"

23:12.700 --> 23:13.250
"Otheon Team Standby Hotel"

23:14.020 --> 23:16.320
We're in the middle of
an important mission right now!

23:16.320 --> 23:19.970
You should leave
everything else to the local heroes!

23:19.970 --> 23:22.600
Heroes are supposed
to save those in trouble, right ?

23:22.600 --> 23:27.120
We didn't learn to assign importance
to jobs during our work study.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.570
You're not even sorry?!

23:30.520 --> 23:32.350
Well, what happened to Deku?

23:32.350 --> 23:35.250
He's following someone who
was working with the jewel thieves.

23:35.350 --> 23:37.250
But he's not picking up his phone at all.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.620
Slackers!

23:38.620 --> 23:41.820
I shouldn't have brought you with me
even if you were doing your work studies!

23:42.000 --> 23:43.070
It's from Midoriya.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.320
Midoriya, do you have
the suspect and the case?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.320
We were suddenly attacked by the police!

23:48.820 --> 23:50.420
What did you do?

23:50.420 --> 23:51.900
I don't know!

23:51.900 --> 23:55.020
They didn't say anything before
they suddenly started shooting at us...!

23:55.020 --> 23:56.470
When we tried to run away,

23:56.470 --> 23:58.320
We were attacked by someone
who looked like a villain...

23:58.320 --> 24:01.670
Calm down! Tell me what happened in order.

24:02.850 --> 24:07.320
Um, I chased the kid who ran away
whit the case and caught him,

24:07.320 --> 24:10.420
but there wasn't any jewelry
in the case he was holding--

24:10.620 --> 24:12.300
Endeavor, this is bad!

24:12.970 --> 24:14.220
Deke is...

24:14.220 --> 24:15.720
...any information.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.770
Once again, according to police reports,

24:17.770 --> 24:20.600
the suspect, who is thought
to have killed 12 people,

24:20.600 --> 24:24.600
is the Japanese hero, " Deku,"
the alias of Izuku Midoriya.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.950
He has been put on
the nationwide wanted list.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.450
There are also reports
that he has an accomplice...

24:31.450 --> 24:34.350
Hello? Hello? Todoroki?

24:35.170 --> 24:37.750
Midoriya...What did you really do?

24:37.750 --> 24:39.600
I didn't do anything!

24:39.600 --> 24:43.320
You're on the wanted list
as a mass murder suspect.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.900
Wh-What do you mean by "wanted list" ?

24:47.900 --> 24:49.770
We'll look into that on our end.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.720
You just get away from there immediately.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.420
They'll track you with GPS.

24:53.420 --> 24:56.320
Once you turn off your phone,
don't forget to take out the battery.

24:58.020 --> 24:59.270
That scared me!

24:59.800 --> 25:02.200
You were able to get in touch
with your friends, right?

25:03.720 --> 25:05.370
Why are you taking out the battery?

25:05.370 --> 25:07.670
When did they say
they'd be coming to get us?

25:08.770 --> 25:10.170
A-About that...

25:12.670 --> 25:14.650
We have an emergency call
from the Otheon team!

25:14.800 --> 25:16.820
Apparently, Deku's
been put on the wanted list!

25:18.300 --> 25:19.820
Young Midoriya?!

25:19.820 --> 25:19.920
"Japan Team Standby Hotel"

25:19.920 --> 25:21.670
How could that happen?!
"Japan Team Standby Hotel"

25:21.670 --> 25:21.870
"Japan Team Standby Hotel"

25:21.870 --> 25:22.000
It says he killed
12 civillans in Otheon...
"Japan Team Standby Hotel"

25:22.000 --> 25:24.870
It says he killed
12 civillans in Otheon...

25:25.300 --> 25:27.270
That's ridiculous!

25:27.370 --> 25:28.370
"Egypt Team Standby Hotel"

25:28.370 --> 25:29.950
But it's intel from HQ...
"Egypt Team Standby Hotel"

25:29.950 --> 25:30.100
But it's intel from HQ...

25:30.200 --> 25:34.350
Wait, wait! There's no way Midoriya
would do something like that! Right?

25:34.550 --> 25:37.400
Yeah, this has to be some kind of mistake.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.670
It's a false report!

25:38.670 --> 25:39.820
"France Team Standby Hotel"

25:39.820 --> 25:40.750
I can't believe it.
"France Team Standby Hotel"

25:40.750 --> 25:41.050
I can't believe it.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.620
Deku...

25:42.820 --> 25:46.500
Deku would never do something like that!

25:46.850 --> 25:47.370
Ribbit!

25:47.370 --> 25:49.750
I'm sure there's something behind this.

25:49.750 --> 25:50.670
Yeah, yeah!

25:51.320 --> 25:55.000
Don't worry. Endeavor
and the others are also acting.

26:00.170 --> 26:01.800
What's going on?!

26:01.800 --> 26:04.750
You're a murderer,
and I'm your accomplice?

26:04.750 --> 26:08.900
When did we end up on
the same side? Explain yourself!

26:09.370 --> 26:13.550
I don't know how it
ended up like this either...

26:15.300 --> 26:17.750
Oh, it's all over...

26:17.750 --> 26:20.870
My life is already rock-bottom.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.320
What'll happen if I fall even lower?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.250
This is the worst.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.000
This is all your fault!

26:29.000 --> 26:31.320
Do something! You're a hero, right?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.070
The police fired
without asking any questions,

26:36.070 --> 26:38.400
and we were even attacked by a villain.

26:38.400 --> 26:42.300
That means they don't care
if we're dead or alive.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.470
In other words, they're not after us...

26:46.800 --> 26:47.850
This?!

26:49.670 --> 26:51.200
It's no good...

26:51.200 --> 26:53.600
There's nothing in here
that looks incriminating...

26:54.100 --> 26:56.070
Wait, what are you doing?!

26:56.970 --> 26:58.920
They're after the case, right?

26:58.920 --> 27:02.300
In that case, if we give it to them,
then it'll all be settled!

27:02.300 --> 27:05.300
Yeah, it's as simple as that!

27:05.500 --> 27:07.070
It's not that simple.

27:07.620 --> 27:12.920
They'd probably want to silence us
since we know about the case...

27:13.020 --> 27:14.650
Wait, wait, wait.

27:14.820 --> 27:17.420
Don't think about it so negatively!

27:17.420 --> 27:19.550
Right. Let's burn the case.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.870
And then we can say, "Oh, it burned up!"

27:21.870 --> 27:23.870
That wouldn't change anthing.

27:24.870 --> 27:27.170
Then why don't we just go to the police?

27:27.170 --> 27:29.170
Huh? What would we say?

27:29.170 --> 27:33.000
"If you want the case,
then give us a million eurus!"

27:33.100 --> 27:35.300
That would make us real criminals!

27:35.300 --> 27:37.050
We can't give in to despair!

27:38.600 --> 27:41.820
Come on, let's just hand over the case.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.270
They won't go so far as to kill us.

27:44.270 --> 27:46.270
You're overthinking this.

27:47.950 --> 27:51.300
If this case is related
to some sort of crime,

27:51.300 --> 27:53.900
then we can't just hand it over.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.450
Don't get me involved
with your idea of justice!

27:57.720 --> 28:00.600
We're already both involved.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.200
They wanted to kill us.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.250
If we don't know the reason why,

28:05.700 --> 28:09.470
then it's dangerous to act rashly.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.550
Then, what should we do?

28:16.400 --> 28:17.620
Let's run.

28:18.570 --> 28:19.500
Huh?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.850
No matter what the situation,

28:22.850 --> 28:25.320
we can't fight against the police.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.800
The ones chasing us are the Otheon police.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.170
If we cross the border into
the neighboring country of Klayd,

28:32.170 --> 28:35.470
then they shouldn't be able
to do anything anymore.

28:35.900 --> 28:39.020
Let's hurry up and get out of here
before we're surrounded.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.470
What about the villain?

28:40.700 --> 28:42.900
What if the villain chases after us?

28:43.620 --> 28:46.900
If that happens,
then I promise I'll protect you.

28:47.750 --> 28:52.220
--Huh?
--I think running away is our
best course of action right now.

28:52.450 --> 28:55.500
Oh, yeah? Okay, fine, I get it.

28:55.750 --> 28:59.020
I'll go to the border
or wherever you wanna go!

28:59.970 --> 29:02.700
We can head toward the border on that bus.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.620
If we hang onto the back, it'll be free.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.950
We can't do that! We have to pay!

29:06.950 --> 29:08.800
We're wanted criminals, remember?

29:08.800 --> 29:11.020
It'll be over if someone reports us.

29:14.350 --> 29:15.500
Oh, jeez!

29:18.770 --> 29:20.850
Right, catching a free ride.

29:21.370 --> 29:23.650
We're the same now, hero.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.170
Delaware Smash...

29:27.170 --> 29:29.170
...Air Force!

29:32.920 --> 29:34.850
I paid in advance for two!

29:35.350 --> 29:37.620
So riding on the roof is okay?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.170
No...

29:41.350 --> 29:43.770
Otheon Police HQ

29:44.020 --> 29:44.900
Commissioner General!

29:44.900 --> 29:47.120
I would like you to present
the evidence you have

29:47.120 --> 29:50.650
"Otheon Police
Commissioner General's Office"
that makes you suspect
Izuku Midoriya is a mass murderer!

29:50.650 --> 29:51.070
that makes you suspect
Izuku Midoriya is a mass murderer!

29:51.200 --> 29:53.970
The case against Izuku Midoriya
is still pending.

29:53.970 --> 29:57.070
I can't talk about the investigation.

29:57.070 --> 30:00.400
Especially not to you,
a fellow Japanese hero.

30:07.150 --> 30:11.020
Japan's number one hero, Endeavor...

30:11.020 --> 30:14.100
Someone gravely afflicted with stage 5...

30:16.520 --> 30:18.920
For the salvation of humanity...

30:20.500 --> 30:21.300
Shoto!

30:22.100 --> 30:24.470
I got the report back from
a detective friend of mine.

30:24.850 --> 30:25.950
What does it say?

30:26.400 --> 30:29.520
That car you saw that
was attacked by a Quirk

30:29.520 --> 30:33.550
was carrying a member of Humarise.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.620
Humarise...?!

30:36.120 --> 30:37.820
Where is he now?

30:37.820 --> 30:39.750
He's in a coma in critical condition

30:39.750 --> 30:42.120
in the hospital's ICU--

30:42.120 --> 30:44.500
Guarded by police.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.650
So we can't talk to him, huh?

30:46.650 --> 30:48.650
There's also one more thing...

30:49.120 --> 30:53.020
It looks like the stolen jewelry

30:54.220 --> 30:55.900
Don't tell me...

30:57.450 --> 30:59.270
It's a message from Midoriya.

30:59.270 --> 31:00.670
What does it say?

31:00.670 --> 31:01.850
"Keep eating luch with strawberries

31:01.920 --> 31:04.850
and make sure you eat
the dinner in the fridge, too."

31:04.900 --> 31:07.100
He's telling us to eat strawberries...?

31:07.250 --> 31:08.800
Isn't this a code?

31:09.600 --> 31:10.720
I see...

31:11.000 --> 31:13.750
K-L-A-Y-D...

31:14.850 --> 31:16.170
Kalayd...

31:16.420 --> 31:18.950
He means the neighboring
country, Klayd, right?

31:19.450 --> 31:21.650
Midoriya's heading there.

31:22.550 --> 31:23.870
I'm going to try going to Klayd.

31:23.870 --> 31:26.570
Okay, I'll give Endeavor a report.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.620
Bakugo, let's go.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.070
Where are we going all of a sudden?!

31:33.720 --> 31:35.820
It's about that damn Deku, right?

31:36.050 --> 31:37.850
Yeah, I'll tell you later

31:39.200 --> 31:40.850
First we have to give
those guards the slip.

31:41.020 --> 31:42.850
Don't order me around!

31:47.120 --> 31:50.800
I hope Todoroki and
the others can figure it out...

31:50.800 --> 31:53.820
The secret hidden in this case...

32:01.420 --> 32:02.700
The police...

32:03.850 --> 32:05.300
...don't look like they're here.

32:05.470 --> 32:06.020
Hey.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.920
It's okay for me to make
a phone call, right?

32:09.100 --> 32:10.070
Y-Yeah.

32:10.070 --> 32:13.950
They didn'n have anything
about you on TV, so I think it's okay

32:13.950 --> 32:15.850
but try to make it short.

32:15.850 --> 32:16.620
Right.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.570
Yes, this is Stanleyk.

32:23.570 --> 32:24.800
O-Old man?

32:24.800 --> 32:26.800
Hm? Is that you, Rody?!

32:26.800 --> 32:29.300
Uh, sorry to call out of the blue,

32:29.300 --> 32:31.700
but can you go to my house
and tell my little brother and sister

32:31.770 --> 32:34.120
that I won't be home for a while?

32:34.550 --> 32:36.120
I'll pay you later...

32:36.120 --> 32:37.520
You idiot!

32:38.300 --> 32:41.020
I have no obligation to do that for you!

32:41.020 --> 32:44.500
More importantly, I got a complaint
saying the delivery wasn't made!

32:44.500 --> 32:45.620
Well, that was--

32:45.620 --> 32:46.770
I don't want to hear any excuses!

32:46.770 --> 32:47.500
It's not that!

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
If you don't want to die,
then hurry up and deliver the goods!

32:49.500 --> 32:50.920
Got it?!

32:55.670 --> 32:58.400
I don't have the goods...

32:59.200 --> 33:00.200
Damn it!

33:02.070 --> 33:03.370
Is something wrong?

33:05.070 --> 33:07.270
No, it's nothing.

33:09.020 --> 33:12.570
Huh? The cases got switched?

33:12.570 --> 33:13.420
Yeah.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.720
The case with the
jewelry stolen by the villain--

33:16.720 --> 33:20.350
Midoriya said it got mixed up
with another case during the chase

33:20.350 --> 33:25.520
The case Midoriya has now used
to belong to a Humarise member.

33:25.870 --> 33:29.570
So that's why the police are
chasing that damn Deku, too?

33:29.770 --> 33:31.500
Probably.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.750
That case is probably pretty important.

33:34.750 --> 33:38.870
If it weren't, then the police
wouldn't be moving at such a large scale.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.970
There are Humarise members
in the police, too, huh?

33:42.100 --> 33:45.970
Yeah,we don't know
where Humarise will show up.

33:45.970 --> 33:47.650
We'll have to act carefully.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.200
Don't order me around.

33:55.400 --> 33:59.570
As expected, there's no
transit system going to the border.

33:59.570 --> 34:04.350
We'll have to get a
vehicle somewhere or walk.

34:04.550 --> 34:06.600
Walk?! There's no way.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.750
Do you know how heavy this is?

34:08.750 --> 34:11.850
If you get tired,
I'll carry you on my back.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.550
Helping people in trouble--

34:14.550 --> 34:17.219
That's what my strength is for.

34:19.420 --> 34:23.120
I'm already in trouble,
so can you hurry up and help me?

34:23.820 --> 34:26.020
Yeah, I'll definitely help you.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.870
Okay, here I go!

34:47.949 --> 34:49.820
Big Bro, me too!

34:49.920 --> 34:50.600
Here

34:53.969 --> 34:54.949
Lucky!

34:54.949 --> 34:55.670
Me next!

34:55.670 --> 34:56.870
Me too!

34:58.370 --> 35:00.050
Wow, Rody!

35:01.920 --> 35:03.900
Dad! Welcome back!

35:04.570 --> 35:05.820
I'm home.

35:21.350 --> 35:24.100
Hey, the puzzle this time's hard.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.320
What should I do to solve it?

35:26.620 --> 35:29.170
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

35:39.950 --> 35:42.670
You can solve it based on that.

35:50.070 --> 35:52.120
Dad, this is your...

35:52.120 --> 35:53.620
It's a present.

35:54.520 --> 35:58.420
Thanks for always taking care
of Roro and Lala, Rody.

36:04.620 --> 36:07.720
I heard the father
of that family ran away.

36:08.020 --> 36:11.320
On top of that,
he became a member of Humarise.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.470
That crazy group that thinks
those with Quirks are sick?

36:15.870 --> 36:18.550
They were responsibility for
the incident the other day, too.

36:18.550 --> 36:20.750
He was a famous engineer, wasn't he?

36:20.750 --> 36:23.350
You can't judge a book by its cover.

36:23.750 --> 36:26.570
Kids, don't play with them anymore.

36:26.570 --> 36:28.570
You don't know what they'll do to you.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.020
Okay.

36:30.020 --> 36:31.100
--Let's go!
--Okay.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
Let's go! Let's go!

36:39.100 --> 36:40.270
Big Bro...

36:41.050 --> 36:43.470
I'll always stay with you, okay?

36:44.420 --> 36:46.920
No matter what I have to do...

37:09.800 --> 37:13.820
If this case is related
to some sort of crime,

37:13.920 --> 37:16.000
then we can't just hand it over.

37:30.570 --> 37:31.600
Hello?

37:39.050 --> 37:40.350
What...?

37:47.470 --> 37:48.400
Don't tell me...

38:01.900 --> 38:03.770
Are you with the police?

38:03.970 --> 38:05.920
Hand over the case.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.850
This means I'm free, right?

38:17.700 --> 38:19.350
Where's your friend?

38:19.870 --> 38:20.500
Huh?

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
You both know, right?

38:24.200 --> 38:28.150
This case's secret!

38:29.320 --> 38:31.070
N-No, we don't!

38:32.070 --> 38:34.520
We don't know anything!

38:35.570 --> 38:38.220
My little brother and sister are waiting.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.020
Please...!

38:40.020 --> 38:42.920
Let me go home!

38:46.520 --> 38:48.220
Air Force is...

38:48.220 --> 38:49.820
Then...

38:50.000 --> 38:52.600
Smash!

38:59.650 --> 39:01.500
I... I...

39:09.400 --> 39:11.320
Smash!

39:15.170 --> 39:16.320
Y-You...

39:16.700 --> 39:18.470
Hold on tight.

39:22.850 --> 39:24.120
Damn it!

39:32.500 --> 39:35.350
Hang on. I'll get some
ointment right away!

39:35.420 --> 39:37.770
It.. It's not that deep.

39:38.670 --> 39:41.300
My phone's dead, though.

39:43.170 --> 39:47.420
Sorry, can you pull out the
first aid kit from my backpack?

39:47.700 --> 39:48.950
Y-Yeah.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.620
That villain's tough.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.600
Once we treat this,
let's get away from here.

40:09.870 --> 40:12.350
Why did you protect me?

40:12.550 --> 40:13.950
Why...?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.850
I took the case.

40:21.220 --> 40:23.100
I betrayed you.

40:23.770 --> 40:27.620
Instead of protecting me, you could've
taken the case back and run away.

40:28.670 --> 40:30.520
I couldn't do that.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.350
I was carrying the jewelry
the villains stole this afternoon.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.900
I'm one of those criminals
you heroes hate!

40:38.900 --> 40:41.820
I can't leave someone
who's in trouble alone.

40:42.650 --> 40:45.320
I can't help but feel like
I want to help them.

40:46.870 --> 40:49.700
It's not worth it to get hurt over that.

40:51.570 --> 40:54.720
It's enough if I'm able
to help that person.

40:58.350 --> 41:00.550
I don't get it.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.150
It's what I've always admired...

41:06.370 --> 41:11.800
I want to be a hero who
can save peole with a smile.

41:13.670 --> 41:16.200
I want to be like All Might.

41:16.470 --> 41:19.270
By All Might, are you talking about
that hero who's famous worldide?

41:19.270 --> 41:21.970
Yeah, he's my teacher.

41:21.970 --> 41:23.250
Seriously?

41:26.120 --> 41:32.000
You wanted to be like All Might,
so you chased that dream and became a hero

41:33.800 --> 41:35.720
You're completely different from me.

41:35.870 --> 41:36.550
Huh?

41:36.700 --> 41:39.270
I can't think about the future.

41:39.700 --> 41:43.870
I don't have the leeway to say
nonsense like "I want to be a pilot"

41:43.970 --> 41:47.400
It's all I can do to provide
for my young siblings.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.520
- I... I...
- Don't say anything!

41:49.620 --> 41:51.870
I don't want your pity!

41:58.000 --> 41:59.400
Heroes...

41:59.700 --> 42:02.800
I used to think they were all
just people who wanted attention

42:02.900 --> 42:06.170
and wanted to make money
under the guise of helping people

42:07.370 --> 42:11.320
In reality, heroes didn't
come to the town I live in.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.550
Because they wouldn't
make any money there.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.750
But I guess there are heroes
like you around, too.

42:21.020 --> 42:26.750
the morer you help me, the more i wonder
about what I'm doing with my life...

42:27.650 --> 42:29.800
I'm so lame.

42:31.170 --> 42:32.920
I'm lame, too.

42:34.220 --> 42:37.550
I've been wanting to be a hero
since I was a kid,

42:37.970 --> 42:43.100
but people kept telling me that
I couldn't do it, that I couldn't be a hero.

42:43.370 --> 42:47.570
I couldn't use my Quirk properly,
and I was at the bottom of my class.

42:47.650 --> 42:51.820
I'm always being propped up
by my classmates.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.720
I'm still lame.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.750
that's why I want to become cool--

43:00.050 --> 43:05.470
To become a hero who
saves people with a smile...

43:16.300 --> 43:18.020
That's Pino.

43:18.320 --> 43:18.970
Pino?

43:21.570 --> 43:24.620
I'm Rody. Rody Soul.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.470
What's your name?

43:29.100 --> 43:33.400
I'm Izuku Midoriya.
My hero name is Deku.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.850
"Deku."
That's easy to remember.

43:35.950 --> 43:37.450
Yeah, I like it.

43:39.170 --> 43:41.050
Let's get some sleep, Rody.

43:41.350 --> 43:43.800
Yeah, let's, Deku.

43:49.820 --> 43:51.320
I deeply apologize.

43:51.620 --> 43:58.570
They got away just as,
we were about to get them.

43:59.250 --> 44:06.000
English Subtitle by ZORO.to

44:06.650 --> 44:09.620
For the salvation of humanity.

44:25.450 --> 44:26.720
A villain?!

44:32.150 --> 44:33.200
Rody?

44:33.520 --> 44:35.420
Oh, did I wake you?

44:35.520 --> 44:36.400
Where'd you get that car?

44:36.770 --> 44:39.570
I borrowed it. It's too hard to walk.

44:40.450 --> 44:43.420
I even wrote an IOU saying I'd pay later.

44:43.420 --> 44:46.200
In the name of the heroes' association.

44:47.920 --> 44:52.070
If I could've borrowed a Cessna,
we could've gone straight to Klayd, though.

44:52.350 --> 44:53.720
A Cessna...?

44:54.000 --> 44:55.570
Rody, you can fly one?!

44:55.700 --> 44:58.300
Just kidding, get in.

45:02.270 --> 45:03.250
Hey, Deku.

45:03.470 --> 45:04.250
Yeah?

45:04.570 --> 45:08.070
Once we figure out the case's secret,
I can go home, right?

45:08.070 --> 45:09.520
Of course.

45:11.620 --> 45:13.870
You have a younger brother, right?

45:13.870 --> 45:15.200
And sister

45:15.200 --> 45:16.770
What about your parents?

45:16.770 --> 45:21.120
My mom died right after
she had my sister, the youngest.

45:21.120 --> 45:24.900
That's why my dad
did his best to raise us.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.820
But then he disappeared suddenly.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.820
Disappeared?

45:29.820 --> 45:32.500
Do you know about Humarise?

45:32.500 --> 45:35.250
The terrorist organization?

45:36.050 --> 45:40.500
Yeah. After people found out our dad
was a member, things got bad.

45:40.820 --> 45:44.770
Our friends stayed away, we were
kicked out of school and our house,

45:44.870 --> 45:47.370
and I couldn't even get an honest job.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.250
I see...

45:51.200 --> 45:53.150
I resented my dad.

45:53.370 --> 45:57.720
I resented him so much,
and then I stopped caring.

45:58.070 --> 46:00.820
Now, my little brother and sister
are more important.

46:00.820 --> 46:03.900
I want to let them live an honest life.

46:05.050 --> 46:07.320
Oh, they're so cute.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.350
My little brother's so smart!
And my little sister's really cute.

46:12.470 --> 46:13.150
Yeah!

46:13.950 --> 46:16.020
She'll definitely be a beauty
when she grows up.

46:16.020 --> 46:20.050
Front! Face front, Rody!

46:40.520 --> 46:45.870
As usual, we still

46:46.320 --> 46:53.100
Carry our respective sadness

46:54.620 --> 46:59.900
Let's pray again

47:00.220 --> 47:06.520
For tomorrow to arrive

47:06.520 --> 47:08.520
English Subtitle by ZORO.to

47:15.650 --> 47:20.100
Unfulfilled we

47:21.300 --> 47:27.950
Embrace so many roles

47:29.850 --> 47:35.250
Let's share each of them with

47:35.450 --> 47:42.100
Someone

47:44.020 --> 47:52.370
Melting in the incredlble speed of the passing scenery

47:52.370 --> 47:57.800
Everything faded

47:59.170 --> 48:05.450
The young flower vendor standing on the street corner

48:06.700 --> 48:12.670
reminds me of you

48:13.800 --> 48:16.800
Ah

48:16.900 --> 48:23.700
The sound of the bells echoes

48:23.700 --> 48:30.820
Hey, it's not the end but the beginning

48:30.920 --> 48:37.820
You may have forgotten it all

48:37.820 --> 48:45.750
But I hope you're out there smilling somewhere

48:46.670 --> 48:53.050
Smilling somewhere

48:54.700 --> 48:57.770
Man, your Quirk's so useful, Deku.

48:58.700 --> 49:02.970
Hey, Rody. You have a Quirk, right?
What is it?

49:02.970 --> 49:04.700
I don't want to say.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.370
S-sorry...

49:08.700 --> 49:10.420
You won't laugh, will you?

49:10.420 --> 49:11.620
I won't!

49:12.000 --> 49:12.700
Promise?

49:12.700 --> 49:14.700
I promise I won't laugh!

49:16.070 --> 49:18.550
My quirk is...

49:32.020 --> 49:33.970
It's really heavily guarded.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.700
I don't think we can go in
from the front without fighting.

49:39.970 --> 49:42.800
Our only choice is to go over this.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.550
Get on. Hurry.

49:48.550 --> 49:50.550
Deku, take this.

49:51.050 --> 49:51.970
Rody?

49:51.970 --> 49:55.270
It'll be hard for you to
carry me with that injury, right?

49:55.270 --> 49:56.750
This is as far as I go.

49:56.750 --> 50:01.000
But the car's out of gas. I can't
leave you alone in a place like this.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.770
You know how fast I can run away, right?

50:03.770 --> 50:06.870
I'll eat some berries or something
and wait for you here.

50:06.870 --> 50:08.450
Hurry up and figure out the case's secret

50:08.450 --> 50:10.150
and come back for me.

50:10.150 --> 50:11.200
Rody...

50:11.650 --> 50:14.550
I'm counting on you, hero!

50:21.870 --> 50:23.100
It's them...!

50:30.100 --> 50:32.570
I can't fail again...!

50:37.600 --> 50:39.020
Use this!

50:48.250 --> 50:51.050
Damn it, what's with those guys?!

51:08.220 --> 51:11.770
Delaware Smash...

51:11.770 --> 51:14.700
...Air Force!

51:24.220 --> 51:25.050
Rody!

51:25.050 --> 51:26.370
Are you okay?

51:26.950 --> 51:28.320
Yeah, somehow...

51:29.300 --> 51:30.320
The case!

51:32.350 --> 51:33.150
Rody!

51:41.520 --> 51:42.600
Rody...!

51:51.320 --> 51:54.800
Take it, Deku!

51:54.800 --> 51:55.820
Rody!

51:59.550 --> 52:04.900
For the salvation of humanity!

52:14.350 --> 52:15.370
This is...

52:15.370 --> 52:17.170
Todoroki?!

52:17.170 --> 52:18.700
It's the same as during the Hosu incident.

52:18.700 --> 52:21.150
Your messages are too hard to understand.

52:24.820 --> 52:26.920
Where are you looking?!

52:31.720 --> 52:34.050
H-Help me! I'll do anything!

52:34.050 --> 52:36.600
Then tell me what I want to know.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.370
Fine...

52:42.750 --> 52:45.150
You traitor!

52:45.150 --> 52:45.900
Damn it.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.600
Bakugo, get her!

52:47.600 --> 52:49.800
Don't order me around!

53:01.870 --> 53:03.800
I-It out of control!

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
Just come quietly!

53:09.570 --> 53:12.020
For the salvation of humanity...

53:19.170 --> 53:21.200
Get over there now!

53:24.200 --> 53:25.720
Rody, are you okay?

53:25.720 --> 53:27.720
Y-Yeah, somehow...

53:29.070 --> 53:30.050
Where's the case?

53:30.050 --> 53:32.050
Midoriya, it's this, right?

53:32.270 --> 53:36.170
Thank, Todoroki. But how'd you find us?

53:36.170 --> 53:40.120
Thank to the flashy gunfire,
I saw you from the train.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.020
Is he the one you were talking
about on the phone?

53:43.020 --> 53:46.170
Yeah. He's being treated
as a criminal, like me.

53:46.170 --> 53:48.170
His mame's Rody.

53:48.170 --> 53:50.170
Thanks for earlier.

53:50.170 --> 53:52.550
More importantly, the case!

53:52.550 --> 53:54.550
It's about Humarise, right?

53:54.770 --> 53:56.770
What? Humarise?!

53:56.770 --> 53:59.720
Yeah, that's why we came here.

53:59.720 --> 54:04.100
We thought it was possible we'd be
able to get some important information.

54:07.220 --> 54:09.000
What's the matter, Midoriya?

54:09.250 --> 54:11.020
This is...

54:16.100 --> 54:18.820
Hm... what's this...?

54:18.820 --> 54:21.500
How does it work...?

54:22.750 --> 54:24.100
It's not that one?

54:24.100 --> 54:26.400
It'll just go back to how it was before.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.400
This is hard.

54:28.620 --> 54:30.200
Hm...that's not it...

54:30.200 --> 54:33.070
Give that to me! I'll just blow it up!

54:33.070 --> 54:35.770
You can't do that, Kacchan.

54:35.770 --> 54:38.100
Deku, can I see that for a second?

54:38.700 --> 54:40.200
Do you know how to solve it?

54:40.200 --> 54:43.750
I did a puzzle like this before,
when I was kid.

54:45.970 --> 54:48.050
Let's see...

54:48.920 --> 54:51.320
All right! Got it.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.470
What is it?

54:56.970 --> 54:59.150
This is an information chip.

54:59.450 --> 55:02.120
Okay, there should be a town
at the foot of the mountain.

55:02.120 --> 55:04.120
Let's look into it there.

55:13.350 --> 55:16.000
The target has gone to the
neighboring country of Klayd.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.520
I do not have the
authority to search more.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.700
No matter.

55:21.770 --> 55:23.300
If he's in Klayd,

55:23.300 --> 55:26.650
then he won't be able to come here
while the plan is being carried out.

55:30.900 --> 55:33.800
The time has come
to put the plan into action.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.650
For the salvation of humanity!

55:36.650 --> 55:41.770
For the salvation of humanity!
For the salvation of humanity!

55:41.770 --> 55:44.050
For the salvation of humanity!

55:44.050 --> 55:47.020
For the salvation... of humanity!

56:12.870 --> 56:14.020
This is an emergency

56:14.020 --> 56:17.450
Humarise has started streaming
an internet broadcast!

56:17.450 --> 56:18.900
Pull it up!

56:18.900 --> 56:22.870
We, Humarise, will rise to action

56:22.870 --> 56:26.850
to protect the pure
humans called ''Quirkless''

56:26.850 --> 56:31.320
against those attacked
by the disease of Quirks

56:32.220 --> 56:35.920
The humanity salvation
devices that we developed

56:36.100 --> 56:38.920
have been set in 25 countries
around the world

56:38.920 --> 56:40.920
and have already started moving.

56:40.920 --> 56:42.450
Seriously?!

56:42.900 --> 56:47.570
The salvation of humanity
will come two hours from now.

56:47.570 --> 56:49.370
Two hours?!

56:49.370 --> 56:53.070
However, we are not without mercy.

56:53.070 --> 56:56.700
If you wishto pervent
this plan from going through,

56:56.700 --> 57:00.070
we will tell you the countries
where humanity salvation devices

57:00.120 --> 57:01.570
have been installed.

57:01.670 --> 57:03.170
What dose this mean...?

57:03.170 --> 57:09.120
Even if you do not belleve what we do
you should have an equal chance.

57:11.370 --> 57:15.250
Director, all 25 zones where the
Trigger Bombs have been installed

57:15.250 --> 57:18.750
match up with the 25 zenes where
Humarise's branches are located!

57:18.750 --> 57:21.420
If could be another trap...

57:21.700 --> 57:23.670
Even so...

57:25.720 --> 57:28.750
Give the hero teams
standing by marching orders!

57:28.750 --> 57:29.550
Yes, sirl

57:30.900 --> 57:34.420
There are people panicking in all the
zones where are Trigger Bombs!

57:38.470 --> 57:41.100
The panic's also spreading
to locations outside of those zones!

57:44.120 --> 57:46.820
Transportation systems
are all experiencing gridlock!

57:47.020 --> 57:47.420
Oh, no!

57:47.420 --> 57:50.850
Suneater, you extricate the injured.

57:51.070 --> 57:54.470
Red Riot and Real Steel,
secure an evacuation route!

57:54.620 --> 57:55.920
Roger!

57:57.450 --> 57:59.320
Chimera Kraken!

58:02.600 --> 58:04.600
Let's do this!

58:04.720 --> 58:07.570
Red Gauntlet!

58:09.250 --> 58:10.670
You need to evacuate!

58:10.670 --> 58:11.950
Please hurry!

58:11.950 --> 58:12.970
Cementos!

58:12.970 --> 58:15.020
Let's go, Mic!

58:16.620 --> 58:18.570
Okay, everybody!

58:18.850 --> 58:22.820
We've got a path for you, so go on down!

58:22.820 --> 58:25.570
It's all right, don't panic!

58:26.470 --> 58:28.700
We're counting on you, search team!

58:30.020 --> 58:34.020
We will definitely find
the Trigger Bomb. Got it?

58:34.020 --> 58:35.420
Roger!

58:39.420 --> 58:40.450
Ribbit!

58:41.100 --> 58:44.150
Leave the evacuation here to us!

58:44.400 --> 58:46.500
We'll focus on finding the Trigger Bomb!

58:46.500 --> 58:47.270
Right!

58:47.670 --> 58:51.070
Tsukuyomi, leave the evacuation
to the American team

58:51.070 --> 58:54.050
We'll search for the
Trigger Bomb from the sky!

58:54.050 --> 58:55.050
Roger!

58:55.620 --> 58:58.600
Go, Fierce Wings!

58:59.600 --> 59:02.350
Look in every nook and cranny!

59:03.100 --> 59:06.200
Tokage, take these sensors
to look for the Trigger Bomb!

59:06.200 --> 59:07.220
Got it!

59:08.120 --> 59:10.300
We'll definitely find it!

59:10.300 --> 59:13.150
Momo let's head to the next spot!

59:13.150 --> 59:14.350
Right!

59:16.850 --> 59:20.520
Can we really find the
bomb in such a wide area?

59:20.520 --> 59:22.100
Hello! Hello!

59:22.100 --> 59:23.250
Hello...!

59:23.250 --> 59:24.450
Salaam?!

59:24.450 --> 59:27.350
Don't be found, be the finders!

59:27.750 --> 59:29.350
Follow me!

59:29.350 --> 59:30.320
He's so fast!

59:30.420 --> 59:32.450
He's not paper thin for nothing!

59:33.870 --> 59:35.350
Clair, where's the Trigger Bomb?

59:35.350 --> 59:38.870
It's not in this zone.
Let's move to the next zone!

59:38.870 --> 59:40.870
English Subtitle by ZORO.to

59:41.220 --> 59:43.770
Shoto...
What are you doing?

59:43.850 --> 59:46.320
Hurry up and come back!

59:51.320 --> 59:53.370
Wow, there are so many...

59:53.500 --> 59:54.770
Where should we look first...?

59:54.820 --> 59:55.370
Move!

59:55.500 --> 59:57.570
Where's the newest timestamp...?

59:58.170 --> 01:00:00.100
It's this video file

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:05.300
My name is Alan Kay.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.650
I'm one of the scientists
Humarise kidnapped.

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.020
Kidnapped?

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.620
Humarise took the families
of many scientists hostage

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.450
and forced the scientists to manufacture
Quirk Factor Triggering Bombs.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.520
The first terrorist attack using the bomb

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.520
laid the groundwork to garther top heroes

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.600
at places where humarise
bramches are located

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.970
Next, they are planning to use
the Quirk Factor Triggering Bombs

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.970
to eradicate those heroes.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.150
After losing its top heroes,
society would collapse.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.170
Using the chaos surrounding that,
they would wipe out Quirk holders

01:00:46.170 --> 01:00:49.650
and make the world
into one with only Quirkless.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:56.550
That is the true goal
of Humarise's Flect Turn.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.200
I hope my voice will reach the heroes

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.820
Take this key that my colleague,
Eddie Soul, who was also kidnapped,

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.270
made in exchange for
his life to disarm the bombs.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:11.500
Please! Save the world...

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:22.820
I repeat

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.250
the organization advocating
for the salvation of humanity,

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:28.400
Humarise has set bomb in different
locations around the world

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:31.550
They have released an announcement
declaring that in two hours...

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:34.700
one hours and 52 minutes
to be exact--the bombs will explode.

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:37.120
In the zones where
humarise has set the bombs,

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.970
there has been panic,

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:43.320
and heroes have been working to direct
people to safety and remove the bombs

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.070
areas in danger of being aftered
by the bombs are the following...

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.170
You've got to be kidding me

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:52.500
My house is in the
affected area in Otheon...!

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.050
Oh, no...

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.950
Big Bro...

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.050
We should send this to HQ and have
them order the hero teams to retreat--

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.220
We can't do that.

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.370
The heroes are still looking
for the Trigger Bombs.

01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:16.370
Even if they themselves
are the targets for them

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.770
Even if they know that it's a trap,

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.950
as long as there are people who need help,

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:27.170
The heroes would never
leave them and run away.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.270
It's a plan that thought that far ahead

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.500
Then we just have to stop the bombs
with that disarming key.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.820
But here...

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:43.850
move.

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:46.250
The answer has to be in here.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:49.820
You're an idiot if you make a key without
telling people where the door is!

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.000
Which point wasn't part
or their crime announcement...?

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.370
This is where their damn base is!

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.450
Kacchan, where's the
Trigger Bomb control system?

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.850
I'm working on it, damn nerd!

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.320
The underground
area furthest in the back...

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.770
we know where it is,

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:09.770
But it's more than 400 kilometers
away as the crow files.

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.120
we can make it

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.570
I have an idea.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.520
Don't worry.
I know the basic controls.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.000
This is no time to be chirping!

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.650
We'll definitely stop the Trigger Bombs.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.900
We'll crush those crazy bastards!

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:46.270
We'll definitely protect the heroes..

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:49.550
..and the world!

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.750
We just received a transmission from
Shoto, a hero who was sent to Otheon.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.800
he said he obtained a
disarming key for the Trigger Bobms!

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.950
Where is he now?

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:01.900
He says he's heading to where
the Trigger Bombs main system is,

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.620
in a hidden Humarise facility.

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:08.400
Young Todoroki... Young Bakugo...

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.550
Young Midoriya...

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.220
Shoto is heading over
to disarm the Trigger Bombs?!

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.420
We'll go to support him immediately!

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.620
You can't.
Our first priority is bomb removal.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.550
Endeavor!

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.400
What is it?

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.250
I found the Trigger Bomb!

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.320
Where?

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.970
It's stopped in front of
the North Gate of Otheon Tower.

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:28.050
It's inside a large semi!

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.670
Heroes near the tower,
head over to remove it!

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.750
Roger!

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.170
Clair?!

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.450
This is...

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.800
Shoji! They're saying Midoriya and the others
are heading over to disarm the bomb!

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:43.450
Don't lose focus, Jiro!

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.170
What we should be doing right now

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:47.270
is performing the mission we were given.

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:49.000
R-Right!

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.020
I've found the Trigger Bomb!

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.420
It's in the third container
of that freight train!

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:00.020
All right!

01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:08.250
A villain?! Why?

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:10.470
Man, there's a guard?

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.150
Uravity! Froppy!

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:14.870
Take the Trigger Bomb somewhere safe!

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.170
--Ribbit!
-- Yes, ma'am!

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.420
I believe Deku and the others
will stop the bomb for us!

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.970
but we'll do what we can do right now!

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:27.020
Move...!

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:31.920
The teams have found the Trigger Bombs,

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.650
But they're meeting resistance
from humarise and can't remove them.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.000
There are less than 30 minutes left...

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:41.100
The heroes are also
all fighting desperately...

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.870
I'm counting on you, future heroes!

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.000
We're close!

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.870
Purge the gravely afflicted.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.350
That's their base!

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.550
I'm gonna land, so hang on!

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.700
Rody, you turn back after this.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:12.050
Why?!

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:14.300
Commoners, like you should stay put...

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.470
After this...

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:18.420
...is a job for heroes!

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.350
small fry should just stay back!

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.120
Some of their members have Quirks, too!

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.570
It's not just the mercenaries?

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.270
A sound wave...?!

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.750
Kacchan!

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:50.750
I know!

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.770
Midoriya!

01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:04.350
Bakugo, we'll leave this place to you!

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.720
We won't let you go!

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.900
Don't tell me what to do!

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.900
Stop!

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.850
We're taking a right at the end here!

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:14.850
All right!

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.320
Just a bunch of small fry, huh?

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:37.470
Why are you damn villains
helping Humarise, huh?

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:41.820
We have been chosen by Humarise!

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.100
We will work with them
and live in a new world!

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.650
So you're just trying to save yourselves?

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.500
That's so selfish.

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500
Damn villains...

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.350
Die!

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:02.700
They're fast!

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:23.000
Those guys just did what they wanted.

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:30.020
You're Rody Soul, right?

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.050
Todoroki!

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:46.200
Go on head!

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.420
There's no time!

01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:58.170
I'll take care of you all at once!

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:02.200
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:33.970
Fire didn't work?!

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:42.720
He isn't aware of himself.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.520
Is he using Trigger?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.570
Is he rotating his Quirk
to control the flow of water?

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.770
Smash!

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.470
Bastard!

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.600
Damn it!

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.500
Even the explosion itself was cut?!

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.950
Don't act like this is nothing!

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.220
At point blank!

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.920
Too bad!

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:11.470
All that moving around's annoying!

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:36.700
That laugh...

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:40.050
I can't stand it!

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:00.620
Small fry like you don't get it, huh?

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.270
I stocked up on grenades
while I was fighting.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:30.850
You've turned into real crazies now!

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.720
Hurry! Hurry!

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.220
Don't get in my way!

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.970
This is the room furthest back...

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:57.770
Which means, the Trigger Bomb
control system is beyond those doors.

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:02.500
Go away.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.700
This is not a place where someone
gravely afflicted like you can enter.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.700
The leader of the organization,
Flect Turn...

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:16.820
This is a holy place that will bring
about the salvation of humanity.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.770
This isn't the salvation of humanity.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:24.470
The Quirk Doomsday Theory
hasn't been scientifically verified!

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:26.350
It's just a popular belief!

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.520
How can you accept something
so uncertain without questioning it

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.370
and do something so terrible?

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:39.670
Pure humans are being threatened
by the disease of Quirks.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.450
As time passes, they mix,
evolve, and go out of control,

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.670
driving humanity to destruction.

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:49.150
That's not true!

01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:52.270
Whether someone has a Quirk or is Quirkless
doesn't mean they're sick or anything!

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:55.250
We're all alive. We're all human!

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.500
The gravely afflicted are beyond help.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:02.500
I must be the one to do it after all.

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:06.170
I will definitely stop the Trigger Bomb!

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:10.500
Smash...!

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:34.200
I-It was repelled...

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:38.470
No, this shock and force...

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.970
It feels like a Smash...

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.000
That's right.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.970
I was born with a disease...

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:54.950
A disease that won't go away
that reflects everything...

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.200
I knew it.

01:14:56.570 --> 01:15:00.050
His Quirk lets him
reflect anything he receives.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:03.370
And it's the kind that's always activated.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.500
You've got a Quirk, too,

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:09.670
so why won't you believe in them?

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:20.800
He can even... do long-distance attacks...

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.800
Believe in them?

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.370
You fool.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.350
Because of this disease,

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:34.420
I was never once held by my parents.

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:39.600
Even my bosom friends
and those I gave my heart to

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.770
left me, who reflected
even their feelings...

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.000
Since I reflect everything,
I couldn't even choose death for myself.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.800
A Quirk that cannot be
controlled only leads to pain.

01:15:57.170 --> 01:16:02.870
And people's bodies and hearts were
being crushed by the evolving Quirks!

01:16:03.450 --> 01:16:07.350
I'll stop using my Quirks
just at the moment of impact!

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.850
Even then, it's reflected!

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:32.320
F-Focus all the impact into one point...

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.720
Then...

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.800
I'll run all out and head
toward the control system!

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.970
I reject myself.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.770
I will eradicate the disease
called Quirks from this world.

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:54.320
And then, I will save
the pure humans from destruction!

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.800
Poor thing...

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:16.870
In five minutes...

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:23.250
the first step toward the salvation
of humannity will finally begin...

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:26.620
...through the death of many heroes.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:29.220
I won't let you...

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:35.200
I will definitely stop the Trigger Bomb!

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.220
Then, I'll kill you with your friends.

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.320
Uraraka...

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.400
Asui...

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.600
Kaminari...

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.670
Sero...

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.170
Mineta...

01:17:56.850 --> 01:17:57.920
Kirishima...

01:17:58.770 --> 01:17:59.950
Shoji...

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.470
Jiro...

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.170
Yaoyorozu...

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:10.520
They're all fighting desperately...

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:14.850
To stop the Trigger Bomb...

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.150
To protect everyone's smiles...

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.120
Think...

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:27.950
How can you beat that guy...?

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.250
R-Rody... Why...?

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.970
It's fine now, Deku.

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:53.950
Th-This is dangerous...

01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:56.400
Get away... from here...

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.170
I will, once I give this to those guys.

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:04.170
Th-The disarming key...?

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:06.150
Rody...?!

01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:08.800
I was told...

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.300
...that if I did, they'd stop
just the Otheon explosion.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.720
Rody, no...

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:22.520
We'll definitely stop it...!

01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:26.970
How are you gonna stop it
with your body like that?

01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:28.600
There's no more time.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.600
The bomb's gonna explode.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.470
It's game over.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:34.250
Rody...

01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:39.020
So I'll just protect
my little brother and sister.

01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:47.920
Deku, I'm a worthless delinquent.

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:53.550
I can't protect everything,
take on everything... like a hero like you.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.020
The world or my family...

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.350
If it's only one or the other,

01:19:58.350 --> 01:20:00.850
then I have to choose.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.320
It was like that for my dad,
too, wasn't it?

01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.150
Yes.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.150
Your father, Eddie Soul,

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.870
helped develop the
humanity salvation bomb.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.420
Eddie...

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.970
Take this key that my colleague
Eddie Soul, who was also kidnapped

01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:26.350
made in exchange for
his life to disarm the bombs.

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:29.400
Please, save the world.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.370
What do you mean, "helped"?

01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:38.620
You took us, his family, as hostages

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.950
to make him do what you wanted.

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:44.400
Thanks to that, he was able to make
the correct choice.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.550
And you're the same as your father.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.620
You made the correct choice
to protect your loved ones.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.620
I'm the same, too.

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:59.320
I chose this plan because I love humanity.

01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:02.250
Rody... No...

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:04.900
Rody...!!

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500
Rody...

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.670
It's time yo give up, hero...

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:19.170
This is how people are betrayed.

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:23.300
It happens to me, too, all the time.

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.870
It's nothing to cry about.

01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.170
Rody...

01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:41.570
Hey, Rody. You have a quirk, right?
What is it?

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.250
You won't laugh, will you?

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:45.950
I won't!

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:48.220
Promise?

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.370
I promise I won't laugh!

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.050
My Quirk is...

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.650
Pino!

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.370
All right! All according to plan!

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:16.770
Deku!

01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:18.300
You fool!

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.100
Rody!

01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:38.570
Rody...!

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.070
Rody!

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.850
How impertinent...

01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:58.850
Deku!

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.520
Kick that damn bastard's butt!

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:08.050
I'll stop the bomb! Go!

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.420
Go, hero!

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:12.520
Go...!

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.420
I won't let you go!

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.420
I will not let you get past me!

01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:45.120
Rody. You have a Quirk, right? What is it?

01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.870
She's my Quirk...

01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:53.220
Pino's actions...

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.720
...show my true intentions...

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.050
Ready?

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:59.050
No matter how much I lie

01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:01.950
Pino gives away how I really feel.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.020
It really isn't much of a Quirk, right?

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.900
That's not true , Rody.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:15.320
Not being able to lie...

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.400
...is a really wonderful Quirk.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.650
Damn it! I can't react
fast enough on my right side...

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.370
You've finally...

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:18.700
...shut up...!

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:37.250
This time...

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:43.100
...I'm really gonna drive it in!

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.450
Howitzer..

01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:48.920
...Impact...!

01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:12.220
You... idiots...

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.920
I-I'm losing consciousness...

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.350
That's...

01:26:32.650 --> 01:26:36.500
Make it in time...!

01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:58.620
I won't let you get in Midoriya's way!

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.250
Flashfreeze Heatwave!

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:21.100
You can even manipulate flames?

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:26.470
Then, here's the biggest move
I can do right now...

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.100
Flashfire Fist...

01:27:32.850 --> 01:27:35.570
...Jet Kindling!

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.070
Midoriya...

01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:00.250
Make sure...

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:02.620
...you stop it...

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:28.420
L-Like...

01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:31.670
...my dad...

01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:36.620
L-Like...

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.020
...Deku...

01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:51.670
Rody?!

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.950
For both father and son to die in vain...

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.670
There's no saving scum.

01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:06.750
That's not true!

01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:12.800
Rody... my friend...

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.420
...is not scum!

01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:19.750
It's no use.

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.670
You still don't understand?

01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:25.220
It's only natural...

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.970
I believe in Rody!

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.820
I believe in heroes!

01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:40.020
Cover Endeavor!

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.470
Shoto,

01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:44.520
leave this place to me!

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.070
Go, Fierce Wings!

01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:50.070
Get out of harm's way!

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:55.220
Hawks, a new Trigger Bomb
has been discovered!

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.700
What did you say?!

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.600
We're done dealing with it here!

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.170
What about the remaining Trigger Bombs?

01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:01.670
Currently, there are two more!

01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:02.620
Wait!

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.700
A new one's been discovered!

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:04.900
There are three total!

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:07.650
We definitely won't give up!

01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:09.900
Right, Bakugo?!

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.400
Get this up in the air and--

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:17.850
Ribbit!

01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:19.650
Ochaco!

01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:21.350
The Trigger Bomb's--

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.620
I won't give up!

01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:26.900
Deku would never give up!

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.770
Like Midoriya and
the others would ever give up!

01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:35.400
So we won't give up either!

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.770
I will definitely not give up!

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.320
That's right. Heroes won't give up!

01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:50.100
Like we'd ever give up!

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:10.320
Has his power increased...?

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:15.600
No...

01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:18.500
That's not all...

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:21.020
The amount of force is decreasing!

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.270
Right.

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:25.950
There's a limit to his reflecting Quirk!

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.400
In that case--

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.420
I'll surpass that limit!

01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:48.070
Don't tell me...

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:50.520
I've reached the limit of my Quirk...?!

01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:52.900
I-Is that possible...?

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.450
You gave up.

01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:59.870
If you didn't give up,

01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:02.500
if you kept trying,

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.250
you might have been
able to get along with people...

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.320
But you called it a disease,
and then gave up and despaired...

01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:15.820
You stopped trying!

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.570
Shut up...

01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:22.870
We know what it means to never give up...

01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:24.670
Shut up...

01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:29.620
We're always telling ourselves this...

01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:31.670
Shut up...

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:34.970
Go beyond...!

01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:38.220
Plus Ultra!

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.300
Shut up...!

01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:23.420
Detroit Smash...!

01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:53.770
A hero...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.170
...can always break out of a tough spot!

01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:00.420
I know.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.050
Young Midoriya!

01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:08.170
A hero has a lot to protect.

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:10.500
That's why...

01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:14.400
That's why...

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:17.000
...we can't lose!

01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:02.970
United...

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.800
...States of...

01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:11.350
...World Smash...!

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:38.350
It's...

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:41.200
...too late...

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:58.200
Even though...
we're past the time limit...

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.420
There's no explosion...

01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:03.770
It's stopped functioning...

01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.670
Did they... disarm it...?

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:13.000
Yeah, they did it.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.020
Good job, everyone.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.720
Thanks, Rody...

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.850
I'll get you to a hospital soon.

01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:49.900
Deku...

01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:58.170
l-l... protected my family,
like my dad, right?

01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:00.570
Yeah

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.750
I stopped.. the Bomb, right?

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:05.570
Yeah...

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:11.650
I took on everything... like you, right?

01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:15.070
Yeah, you did.

01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:17.070
You're amazing, Rody!

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.050
I'm so cool!

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.470
The terrorist attacks that shook the world

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.870
were successfully prevented
through the work of the hero team.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.400
the leaders of Humarise
who spearheaded the attacks

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.020
are also being arrested one after another,

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.620
and the incident is on
it's way to being resolved

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.670
The case was closed...

01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:19.470
without a single
Trigger Bomb exploding.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:23.050
The heroes protected the world to the end.

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:25.970
But, it wasn't just them.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.420
The one who really saved the world...

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.250
who never give up is...

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:50.650
Rody?

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.200
Thought you weren't getting out
until the day after tomorrow?

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.370
They said I'm fine already.

01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:58.100
I'm glad...

01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:02.220
If I had died like that,
I could've become a legend, though.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.220
Don't say something so unlucky.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:11.170
Hey, what are you going to do now, Rody?

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.820
Just going back to my normal life

01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:20.600
Of course, I'm not choosing one
or the other-- I'm gonna get both.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.550
Yeah.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.620
We will now begin boarding
for flight NNY224

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.550
I need to go

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:33.350
Don't ever come back to Otheon

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:35.670
When I'm with you,
nothing good ever happens.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.370
Go be a hero in Japan.

01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:45.120
I'll come back and visit.

01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:52.670
Don't ever come back.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:57.970
The stillness of a city with nothing

01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:03.700
The uncertainty of a hand holding nothing

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.970
But with just myself

01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:15.400
And these two eyes.
I hold the remains of a dream.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.620
Got a job for me, old man?

01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:22.150
A respectable one, if possible.

01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:26.720
one of my employees quit.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.720
Help me out.

01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:44.350
What should I do?

01:40:45.820 --> 01:41:18.850
