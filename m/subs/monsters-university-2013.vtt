You ruined our doors!

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:37.384
I've been working on
my door all semester!

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:38.452

Yeah, buddy. We have to go.

Harsh, man.

01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:14.421
I'm sorry, guys. You'd be
in the Scaring program

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:15.623
right now if it wasn't for us.

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:20.360

Hardscrabble's letting us
into the Scare program.

What?

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.801
She was impressed with our
performance in the games.

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.070

You're the great Mike Wazowski.
You'll come up with something.

I don't know a single Scarer

I know,
everyone sees us together,

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:06.760
they think I'm the one running
the show, but the truth is,

01:31:06.762 --> 01:31:09.863
I've been riding your
coattails since day one!

01:31:09.865 --> 01:31:11.865
You made the deal
with Hardscrabble.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:14.034
You took a hopeless team
and made them champions.

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:16.169
All I did was catch a pig!

01:31:16.171 --> 01:31:17.871
Technically, I caught the pig.

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:21.041
Exactly! And you
think you're just okay?

01:31:21.043 --> 01:31:23.577
You pulled off the biggest Scare
this school has ever seen!

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:25.745
That wasn't me!
That was you!

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:27.914
You think I could have
done that without you?

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:30.117
I didn't even bring a pencil
on the first day of school.

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.921
Mike, you're not scary.
Not even a little.

01:31:34.923 --> 01:31:36.022
But you are fearless.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:41.061
And if Hardscrabble can't see
that, then she can just...

01:31:41.063 --> 01:31:42.929
I can just what?

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.034
Careful, Mr. Sullivan.
I was just warming up to you.

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.970
Sorry.

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:51.905
Well, gentlemen,

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.176
it seems you made
the front page again.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.248
The two of you did
something together

01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:02.782
that no one has
ever done before.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.218
You surprised me.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:10.891
Perhaps I should keep an
eye out for more surprises

01:32:10.893 --> 01:32:11.958
like you in my program.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:16.530
But as far as the two
of you are concerned

01:32:16.532 --> 01:32:18.012
there is nothing
I can do for you now.

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:22.035
Except, perhaps, wish you luck.

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:29.943
