00:32.198 --> 00:36.578
So surprised my little sister came
to see me off before our big day.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.704
You wish!

00:37.787 --> 00:40.457
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.083
No. It worked perfectly.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.171
How many times do I have to teach you?

00:46.254 --> 00:49.466
Just because something works
doesn't mean that it cannot be improved.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.676
You are teaching me? What do you know?

00:52.552 --> 00:53.553
- More than you.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.598
Shuri!

00:56.973 --> 00:58.016
Sorry, Mother!

01:02.103 --> 01:04.355
-My King!
-Stop it. Stop it.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.400
- I have
great things to show you, Brother.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.278
Here are your communication devices
for Korea.

01:10.987 --> 01:11.988
- Klaue.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.323
It's now or never.

01:13.990 --> 01:18.244
Unlimited range, also equipped
with audio surveillance system.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.789
-We need to move on Klaue.
-T'- Stand down.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.415
We can't afford a shootout.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.296
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

01:33.551 --> 01:36.888
The nanites absorb the kinetic energy...
for redistribution.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.434
-You show-off.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.274
No, no, no!

01:52.987 --> 01:54.114
Get down!

01:54.197 --> 01:55.740
He just jumped in front of me.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.452
Great! Another broken white boy
for us to fix.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.747
All right, where am I?

02:02.831 --> 02:05.291
Bullet wounds
don't just magically heal overnight.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.919
They do here.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.088
But not by magic, by technology.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.423
- There's
vibranium on those trains?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.217
- There's vibranium all around us.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.679
That's how I healed you.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.683
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.769
An American black operative.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.772
A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.192
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

02:34.863 --> 02:35.905
- My son...

02:36.406 --> 02:38.825
was murdered in ritual combat.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.369
-Were the odds fair?
-Yes, but...

02:41.452 --> 02:43.329
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.498
-Do not rub our noses in it!
-Silence!

02:45.582 --> 02:47.750
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.544
Look, Your Highness...

02:49.627 --> 02:53.089
One more word,
and I will feed you to my children.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.930
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

03:01.931 --> 03:02.932
Come with me.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.102
-Impossible!

03:06.603 --> 03:08.188
-Is he breathing?

03:08.271 --> 03:09.856
He's in a coma.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.316
Why do you have him in the snow?

03:11.399 --> 03:14.152
It is the only thing keeping him
from joining the ancestors.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.696
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.448
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.949
Nakia, the Herb.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.832
-Shuri, now.
-- Copy that.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.674
Wakanda forever!

03:49.479 --> 03:50.480
What's up, Princess?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.315
You'll never be a true king.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.860
Brother!

04:04.911 --> 04:06.246
He moves it! He moves it!

04:06.329 --> 04:07.330
- Why here?

04:08.581 --> 04:12.043
T'- This will be the first
Wakandan International Outreach Center.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.880
Nakia will oversee the social outreach.

04:16.965 --> 04:20.134
And you will spearhead
the science and information exchange.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.472
- How are you feeling?

04:24.555 --> 04:25.890
- Good.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.600
Thank you.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.769
Come.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.188
Much more for you to learn.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.027
- Thanos is
not gonna stop until he gets

04:38.111 --> 04:39.570
-Vision's stone.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.072
Then we have to protect it.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.657
No, we have to destroy it.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.741
Can we do that?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.034
Not me, not here.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.703
I know somewhere.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.081
- The structure is polymorphic.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.042
- Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.963
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.259
Because we didn't think of it.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.469
I'm sure you did your best.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.554
Can you do it?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.056
-Yes.
-How long?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.266
As long as you can give me.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.826
The Black Panther lives.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.996
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

05:30.079 --> 05:32.373
I will be right there beside him.
