00:01.626 --> 00:03.628
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.446 --> 00:30.530
(GRUNTS)

00:32.198 --> 00:34.117
I understand she is your sister.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.244
NEBULA: As a child, my father would have

00:36.327 --> 00:38.288
Gamora and me battle
one another in training.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.623
Every time my sister prevailed...

00:40.707 --> 00:42.959
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

00:43.334 --> 00:44.335
But she won...

00:44.544 --> 00:48.298
again and again, never once refraining.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.345
Family reunion. Yay.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.313
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.398
We will not fail you, Father.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.691
No, you won't.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.318
I swear...

01:10.153 --> 01:11.571
I will make you proud.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.200
THE OTHER: Gamora has her own plans
for the Orb.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.368
NEBULA: It is Gamora.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.787
Bring it down!

01:19.788 --> 01:21.748
You are a disappointment, sister.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.584
Of all our siblings, I hated you least.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.961
GAMORA: Nebula!

01:27.045 --> 01:28.463
Help us fight Ronan.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.173
You know he's crazy.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.217
I know you're both crazy.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.635
No!

01:35.470 --> 01:36.638
-What the...?
-Ah!

01:37.305 --> 01:39.724
-NEBULA: Get out!
-(MAN SCREAMING)

01:44.938 --> 01:47.232
(SCREAMS)

01:49.692 --> 01:51.653
(CHOKING)

01:52.904 --> 01:53.905
(GRUNTS)

01:55.240 --> 01:57.158
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!

01:57.242 --> 01:58.660
I'm not the one that just flew across

01:58.743 --> 02:00.078
the universe just
because I wanted to win.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.996
Do not tell me what I want.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.331
I don't need to tell you
what you want!

02:03.414 --> 02:04.415
It's obvious!

02:04.499 --> 02:07.293
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

02:09.337 --> 02:10.338
Nebula...

02:15.051 --> 02:16.469
I was a child like you.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.683
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.394
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.688
(SCREAMING)

02:26.771 --> 02:27.981
I'm trying to make it right.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.024
There are little girls like you...

02:30.233 --> 02:32.735
across the universe who are in danger.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.865
You can stay with us and help them.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.288
You will always be my sister.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.209
ROCKET: Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.004
-We're done for without that generator!
-Ugh!

02:51.880 --> 02:52.881
AYESHA: Guardians...

02:53.006 --> 02:54.883
your deaths will serve as a warning

02:54.966 --> 02:56.926
to all of those tempted
with betraying us.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.052
This is gonna hurt.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.137
Promises, promises.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.307
(SCREAMING)

03:05.894 --> 03:08.813
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.148
Wiping out half of all life.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.568
Well, well.

03:13.943 --> 03:14.944
You should've killed me.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.613
It would've been a waste of parts!

03:16.988 --> 03:18.907
(GRUNTING)

03:22.076 --> 03:23.411
(YELLING)

03:23.494 --> 03:25.496
PETER: Are you ready for one last ride?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.249
Take care of my crew.
This is gonna be hard for them.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.375
Hurry up!

03:29.584 --> 03:30.585
Not her.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.670
PETER: We were always
searching for a family.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.257
Until we found each other.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.010
That is the gist of it.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.312
Whoever it was that you were in love with,

03:49.395 --> 03:50.563
it sounds more like her.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.648
-Her?
-What?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.441
-That's ridiculous. Don't even...
-Do not bring me into this.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.026
(BOTH LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

03:55.902 --> 03:56.945
Knock it off!
