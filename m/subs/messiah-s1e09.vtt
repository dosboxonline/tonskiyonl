[match striking]

00:37.037 --> 00:38.455
[in Hebrew] This week...

00:38.538 --> 00:39.956
my son became a man.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.459
When am I a man?

00:42.876 --> 00:43.835
Sh!

00:43.918 --> 00:44.753
Aviram...

00:45.420 --> 00:46.504
Please recite the blessing.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.554

00:56.097 --> 00:58.767

[little brother]
You can't catch me, Aviram...

01:11.738 --> 01:13.239
Hey, get away from the street!

01:13.573 --> 01:14.574
[laughing]

01:14.657 --> 01:16.326
I'm too fast for you!

01:17.202 --> 01:19.496
You're not a man, you're a turtle...

01:20.580 --> 01:22.082
Aviram, no!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.958
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:24.042 --> 01:25.126
That's enough!

01:26.211 --> 01:29.756
-We're just playing, Mamma!
-That's how it starts.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.300
Hey!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.969
Come back here!

01:35.053 --> 01:35.887
Aviram!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.430
Come back here now!

02:05.291 --> 02:07.293
[phone ringing]

02:08.461 --> 02:09.796

02:29.774 --> 02:31.359
[Zev, in Hebrew] <i>Enjoying your holiday?</i>

02:35.363 --> 02:36.447
Found me.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.283
<i>Of course we did.</i>

02:38.867 --> 02:40.118
You're in deep shit, Avi.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.537
<i>I'm used to it.</i>

02:44.831 --> 02:46.416
You missed your hearing.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.794
Is that why you're calling,
to tell me I'm out of a job?

02:49.878 --> 02:50.962
I already knew that.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.464
I'm calling you because I'm a good boss.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.883
[chuckles]

02:54.966 --> 02:57.552
Right.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.388
I'm offering you a way back in.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.017
<i>Why?</i>

03:04.976 --> 03:06.728
You're in America. It's convenient.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.563
<i>Ah.</i>

03:09.063 --> 03:11.065
<i>It's a way to get your life back.</i>

03:14.819 --> 03:15.653
Aviram?

03:23.411 --> 03:24.579
I'm listening.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.124
[in Arabic] The Palestinian people
have suffered for too long.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.294
I call on everyone,
everywhere in the world...

03:33.838 --> 03:35.590
I call on everyone...

03:36.674 --> 03:39.636
[Imam] who recognizes Israel...

03:40.345 --> 03:42.972
who recognizes Israel...

03:44.307 --> 03:46.726
to also recognize
the State of Palestine...

03:48.603 --> 03:50.021
to also recognize

03:50.104 --> 03:51.356
the State of Palestine...

03:53.316 --> 03:55.193
Why can't someone else do this?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.654
If there was someone else,
I would not have asked you.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.656
But I can't remember these words.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.699
When I begin speaking, they disappear.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.784
They will come.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.119
You know them here...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.288
now you have to know them here.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.459
This is where faith comes from.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.294
[speaks Arabic]

04:13.378 --> 04:16.965
You must believe you can speak the words.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.425
They will come when you need them.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.970
God will provide.

04:22.053 --> 04:26.391
Remember, my son, this not for you
or for me but for our people.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.644
What you say is important
and will be heard by many.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.021
Have faith...

04:34.440 --> 04:36.442
[repeating statement]

04:37.443 --> 04:40.029
who recognizes Israel...

04:40.113 --> 04:42.156
[reciting prayer]

04:42.532 --> 04:44.867
[all repeat] O you who have believed,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.953
[continues reciting prayer]

04:48.955 --> 04:50.790
[all repeat]
what is the matter with you

04:50.873 --> 04:53.293
that, when you are told to go forth
in the cause of God,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.253
[continues reciting]

04:55.336 --> 04:57.463
[all repeat]
you adhere heavily to the earth?

04:58.047 --> 05:00.049
[Zaid continues reciting]

05:00.383 --> 05:02.719
Are you satisfied
with the life of this world

05:04.095 --> 05:05.471
rather than the Hereafter?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.686
[prayer continues]

05:18.443 --> 05:19.944
[prayer fades]

05:27.827 --> 05:29.829
[announcement on PA]

05:33.374 --> 05:34.375
[Zelman] Eva!

05:36.878 --> 05:39.213
Oh... What happened? Dad, are you okay?

05:39.297 --> 05:41.132
-Yeah.
-You didn't say you were hurt.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.176
-Are you hurt?
-No, no, no. I'm fine.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.178
Why's he in a wheelchair?
Why are you in a chair?

05:45.261 --> 05:47.638
-He's fine.
-No, they insisted on the wheels.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.600
-Hey, how are you, sweetheart?
-I... I'm... I'm good.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.394
-Can you walk?
-Yeah, of course I can walk.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.314
I'm just supposed to help him
find his daughter.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.024
-I'm assuming that's you?
-That's me. Yeah.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.901
Okay. Well, he was a little confused.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.320
So I thought you should know that.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.490
I think the flight
might have been a little hard on him.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.076
Well, I... I did, I got a bit upset.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.161
He was caught up in...
in the flooding in Florida.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.412
Oh, I'm fine.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.082
By the time they got to him,
he was dehydrated.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.876
It wouldn't be easy on anybody.
But you're fine now, though, right?

06:16.959 --> 06:20.088
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-Okay, Zelman, end of the line for you.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.756
-No more free rides.
-All right.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.508
[woman laughs]

06:24.926 --> 06:26.010
You ready to go?

06:34.268 --> 06:36.145
-[Anna] You hungry?
-No.

06:37.855 --> 06:38.773
Thank you.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.529
You should eat.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.366
-I could call room service.
-I said I'm not hungry.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.204
We're gonna have to talk about this
at some point.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.876
Sticking your head in the sand
isn't the solution.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.462
There is no solution. That's the problem.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.548
That's why we have to talk about it.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.594
You can't keep giving me
the silent treatment forever.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.847
We have to find a way through this.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.682
As a family.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.059
[laughing] As a family. That's rich.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.604
I understand
you're probably feeling left out.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.566
It's not a feeling. It's a fact.
I was left out.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.695
And you had the hide to accuse me
of not telling you things?

07:26.737 --> 07:28.781
And now, I find this out?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.200
If that's not hypocrisy, what is?

07:33.035 --> 07:34.954
I wonder what else you don't tell me.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.670
What do you really think of me, Anna?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.089
Are you my partner?

07:45.631 --> 07:49.552
Am I the husband you wanted,
or am I just a disappointment?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.929
Clearly, I'm not someone you turn to.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.266
That's not true, Felix.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.186
I love you.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.397
I just couldn't tell you.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.484
I didn't know how.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.571
I knew it would break your heart.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.365
-And it was what Rebecca needed.
-I'm her father!

08:11.449 --> 08:13.034
I know what she needs.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.787
You don't have a right
to make that decision without me.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.373
-You would have said no.
-Of course I would have said no.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.209
We have beliefs!

08:22.084 --> 08:24.795
And they don't include abortions
for young girls.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.882
Or don't you believe that?

08:28.633 --> 08:29.467
[sighs]

08:29.550 --> 08:31.302
What <i>do </i>you believe, Anna?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.139
Do you even believe in God?

08:39.602 --> 08:42.271
I don't believe Rebecca
stuck in Dilley, Texas

08:42.355 --> 08:45.191
as a teen mom for the rest of her life
was an option.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.778
And I wasn't gonna let that
happen to her.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.409
That explains a lot.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.579
What is that supposed to mean?

09:00.039 --> 09:02.542
I'm taking control. That's what it means.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.594
[laughing]

09:14.845 --> 09:16.013
[car door shuts]

09:17.974 --> 09:19.058
Daddy!

09:20.309 --> 09:21.185
[laughs]

09:21.269 --> 09:25.022
-Daddy!
-Oh, I missed you so much!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.108
-Aah!
-I missed you too, Daddy.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.111
Look at you.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.571
-Aww.
-[dog barks]

09:31.654 --> 09:34.407
Max! Oh, I missed you so much!

09:35.866 --> 09:37.827
She seems so much better, doesn't she?

09:38.619 --> 09:39.870
[Raeah] How've you been?

09:39.954 --> 09:42.582
That's what happens
when you go off chemo, Staci.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.585
[he sighs]

10:16.824 --> 10:17.742
Hey, Dad.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.786
Dad.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.997
What are you doing?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.582
-I'm packing.
-Wh--

10:25.750 --> 10:27.877
-Why are you packing?
-Um...

10:29.170 --> 10:31.047
-I've got a plane to catch.
-What?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.467
I got a plane to catch.
I don't want to be late.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.094
You've already caught the plane, Dad.
You're here.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.723
Already caught the plane?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.350
Yes.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.435
We just got here.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.396
Uh... was that today?

10:48.689 --> 10:49.774
Yes, today.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.444
You should be unpacking.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.656
Remember, you're gonna stay with me
for a while?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.204
-[sighs]
-This is gonna be your room.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.832
I'll help you settle in,
and then I'm gonna get to work.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.626
Uh... Oh! Ah! Yeah! Yeah.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.879
Of course. [laughs] I'm gonna be
staying here with you for a while.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.132
There was that flood back home.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.468
Uh, I must...

11:18.302 --> 11:20.346
be tireder than I thought I was.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.225
And certainly not the traveler
that I used to be.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.810
You gonna be okay?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.063
Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine, honey.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.314
Fine.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.901
[he sighs]

11:53.796 --> 11:55.506
-[woman] Good afternoon.
-Hi.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.091
-Will that be all?
-Thank you.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.593
-Would you like to charge it to your bill?
-I'll pay cash.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.590
[Ed] Have to admit, Felix,
I'm surprised to see you.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.717
Ed.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.263
Have a seat.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.934
Well...
I've thought a lot about what you said.

12:49.018 --> 12:53.022
About harnessing all that attention,
giving it a focus.

12:54.523 --> 12:56.567
You're not leaving it up to God anymore?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.779
This can still all be
a part of God's plan.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.240
He looks for us to enact his will, right?

13:04.241 --> 13:06.118
Oh, you think you know God's will?

13:07.411 --> 13:10.456
Look, Ed, you wanted in,
now I'm giving you an in.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.791
It's as simple as that.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.503
You will triple your viewership, at least.

13:16.670 --> 13:20.174
Are you telling me you don't want
your message to reach more people?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.093
You can reach out past this country.

13:23.177 --> 13:27.556
You can reach the world, Ed.
The Messiah on your own TV show.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.268
But if he's not who you say he is...

13:32.353 --> 13:34.146
Well, that's a matter of faith, Ed,

13:34.230 --> 13:36.816
but no one's gonna blame you
for wanting to believe.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.402
Is this his idea or yours?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.529
It's mine.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.742
And he's agreed?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.162
Yes.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.956
Russia.

14:47.845 --> 14:48.679
Same.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.954
[woman] <i>Comms sector.</i>

15:14.038 --> 15:16.081
-Yeah, I need a trace.
<i>-What source ?</i>

15:16.540 --> 15:17.625
Phone number, please.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.629
709-597-449-61.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.300
[man] Over the past 36 hours,
the Russians have mobilized

15:26.383 --> 15:29.219
an estimated 12,000 troops
into the Red Zone.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.640
They can hit targets
inside Latvia right now.

15:33.641 --> 15:37.853
It's a blatant provocation, sir.
If we don't move, they'll feel emboldened.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.274
Well... you call it a provocation,

15:42.358 --> 15:45.527
but we increased our fleet
in the Baltic first, didn't we?

15:45.611 --> 15:46.779
On your orders, sir.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.489
You drew the line.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.241
You can't back away from that.
It makes you look weak.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.327
This demands a response.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.829
We can't afford another Syria.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.211
Sir?

16:05.756 --> 16:07.007
[Collier] Mr. President?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.803
[treadmill whirring]

16:20.145 --> 16:21.188
Keeping fit?

16:22.481 --> 16:25.317
This way, uh... I can walk,
and they know where I am.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.402
Mm.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.114
Who <i>are </i>you?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.201
That's the big question, isn't it?

16:35.703 --> 16:37.204
Payam Golshiri.

16:38.247 --> 16:42.167
Thirty-six, Iranian, you spent
seven months in a psychiatric hospital

16:42.251 --> 16:44.253
diagnosed with delusional disorder.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.132
A "messiah complex,"
that's what the doctors called it.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.176
I don't know if that's ironic or just sad.

16:51.635 --> 16:56.390
Maybe you're a charlatan like your uncle,
or maybe you believe what you're saying.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.684
Whichever way you cut it,
you're being dishonest,

16:58.767 --> 17:00.936
either with yourself or everyone else.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.187
[beeping]

17:07.067 --> 17:09.820
The only other option is
you're being taken advantage of,

17:09.903 --> 17:12.781
and if someone is running you,
Payam, I will find out.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.825
"Running" me?

17:14.908 --> 17:16.744
Of all the universities in the US,

17:16.827 --> 17:20.497
you chose Williams,
a tiny college in Massachusetts.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.335
An unusual choice,
unless you know about Oscar Wallace.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.048
Oscar has a rare mind.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.133
So you do know him.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.344
As you say, it was a small campus.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.432
To know his mind is to know him well.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.142
We shared a lot.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.020
Have you remained in touch with him?

17:44.313 --> 17:45.147
He's a friend.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.277
Willfully communicating with
a known terrorist is a federal offense.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.448
Are you going to arrest me?

17:55.032 --> 17:57.576
Eventually. You can count on that.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.996
-You are so strong in your convictions.
-Yes, I am.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.082
I see you.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.334
And I'm coming to get you.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.760
Hey, you're that TV lady.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.680
The news lady from TV. I recognize you.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.016
Christine Keneally.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.142
Mm...  Mm.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.060
Miriam.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.770
Miriam.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.273
Uh... you're the preacher's wife, right?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.400
You know me?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.574
[knocking at door]

18:41.537 --> 18:42.621
[knocking]

18:52.172 --> 18:53.674
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.717
-You're not.
-Can we talk?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.106
I've been praying.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.150
For answers.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.068
And...

19:13.944 --> 19:16.029
there's a lot I still don't understand.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.074
I realized one thing.

19:20.576 --> 19:24.705
I've always assumed that because
I come from humble beginnings,

19:24.788 --> 19:26.456
I must be a humble man.

19:26.957 --> 19:27.791
But...

19:30.043 --> 19:33.130
I've learned that my lesson
is in humility.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.883
I'm God's servant.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.510
And therefore, I'm your servant.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.053
And, um...

19:41.555 --> 19:43.682
I want to serve you the best way I can.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.269
And how is that?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.943
I realize that I'm in a, uh...

19:55.444 --> 19:56.695
unique position.

19:56.778 --> 20:00.282
I can arrange for you to be
on my father-in-law's television show.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.746
It'll be a safe forum for you to speak
to millions of people at one time.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.956
The media can't twist your words.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.335
It's just you, speaking to people
in their homes.

20:13.128 --> 20:17.299
A message straight from you,
directly to an audience of millions.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.305
It's what God wants. I know it.
Let me do this for you, please.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.685
Please.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.106
Okay.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.278
But I want Rebecca to be there.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.199
Of course.

20:44.534 --> 20:47.788
[Miriam] I have to be honest with you.
I don't get it. I really don't.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.956
Get what?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.084
You and your husband calling him Jesus.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.168
[chuckles]

20:53.252 --> 20:54.544
We don't call him Jesus.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.965
-What do you call him?
-Don't ask me.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.425
Why not? Why shouldn't I ask you?

21:03.929 --> 21:04.805
You know...

21:06.139 --> 21:07.015
What?

21:09.017 --> 21:10.394
Off the record?

21:11.687 --> 21:12.980
Mm-hm.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.692
Everything changed when he came.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.652
Everything.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.320
What do you mean?

21:20.862 --> 21:22.364
My husband won't talk to me.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.201
My daughter is turning into somebody
I don't recognize.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.079
They believe they're chosen.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.873
They're falling all over themselves

21:31.957 --> 21:34.918
for this stranger from a strange land.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.298
Nothin' good has come from any of this
since he showed up.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.176
[sighs] So...

21:45.053 --> 21:47.472
You want to know
who I think he really is?

21:47.556 --> 21:48.682
I do.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.476
I don't know who he is.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.687
Or what he wants.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.231
But...

21:57.816 --> 21:59.776
I do know one thing for certain.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.737
What's that?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.865
He's not the fucking messiah.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.870
[cicadas chirping]

22:11.038 --> 22:13.123
[Jonah] "'Allow me to introduce myself.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.958
My name is Tumnus.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.587
'I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Tumnus,' said Lucy."

22:18.670 --> 22:20.839
"Mr. Tumnus" is a funny name.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.090
It sure is.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.888
"'And may I ask, O Lucy, daughter of Eve,'

22:27.971 --> 22:31.391
said Mr. Tumnus,
'how have you come to Narnia?'

22:31.892 --> 22:34.061
'Narnia? What's that?' said Lucy.

22:34.436 --> 22:38.357
'Well, this is the land of Narnia,'
said the faun.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.277
'Where we are now,
all that lies between the lamppost

22:42.361 --> 22:45.530
and the great castle of Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Sea.'”

22:50.160 --> 22:51.370
[he sighs]

22:52.329 --> 22:53.955
Did she fall asleep? [chuckles]

22:54.581 --> 22:55.624
Out like a light.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.960
She sure loves that book.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.672
You've read it to her
a thousand times already.

23:03.131 --> 23:04.800
[he sighs]

23:05.967 --> 23:07.427
It's good to be back home.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.596
You know?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.516
We really missed you.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.939
Saying that
doesn't make everything better, Staci.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.857
No, I... I know it doesn't.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.568
But it's true.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.114
[sighs] You took our daughter
without even telling me.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.157
In what universe do you think that's okay?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.450
I'm sorry, Jonah.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.036
If I'd have told you,
you would've stopped us.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.415
I couldn't watch her suffer
through chemo again.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.918
-I couldn't do it.
-We spoke about this.

23:40.335 --> 23:44.172
-We decided that she would do another--
-I couldn't do it again. Not this time.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.552
I had to! If there was... a chance,

23:48.635 --> 23:51.805
even the tiniest chance
that he could help her, I had to take it.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.475
You have to understand,
I did this because I love her.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.019
I love you, Staci,
and I can forgive you for a lot,

23:58.103 --> 23:59.688
but I can't for this.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.523
Not for risking her life.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.443
What are you saying?

24:05.652 --> 24:07.320
I'm filing for divorce.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.657
I can't trust you with her anymore.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.493
Jonah, please.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.829
I want sole custody of Raeah.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.122
No--

Does your work have anything to do
with this Messiah man that's on TV?

24:44.524 --> 24:47.027
Yeah, it does, but...
don't worry about it.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.071
I've been having funny feelings lately.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.575
-Yeah?
-Funny in a good way.

But I can't say
that I've ever had them before.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.414
It's like...

25:01.791 --> 25:03.627
I'm connected to things.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.963
I look at the moon...

25:08.798 --> 25:10.509
and I don't see the moon anymore.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.235
Uh... what fish?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.487
The fish before the flood.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.281
It's all connected.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.326

-Listen.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.754
I've never been really religious,
you know,

25:47.837 --> 25:49.673
or felt close to God,

25:49.756 --> 25:51.841
but I have been watching the sunrise,

25:51.925 --> 25:54.177
and sometimes, it just...

25:54.844 --> 25:56.346
uh... it...

25:56.888 --> 25:57.931
fills me.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.856
You're just not usually like this.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.400
Am I upsetting you?

26:10.860 --> 26:11.695
Sort of.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.406
Eva...

26:14.948 --> 26:16.866
Your mom, she believed.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.160
Now, I never did,

26:19.244 --> 26:20.412
but she believed.

26:20.870 --> 26:23.582
She had six miscarriages,
but she never gave up

26:24.040 --> 26:26.543
because she knew that you were out there.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.045
[sighs]

26:29.129 --> 26:30.589
She wanted you.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.340
She had hope.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.427
And she believed
that she was meant to have a child.

26:36.636 --> 26:40.348
And she knew that you were out there
waiting for us to find you.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.269
You were God's gift.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.356
Okay, Dad.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.318
-That's what she used to say.
-I don't wanna talk about this.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.196
You brought your mom and me
such... ah, happiness.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.199
Stop talking about Mom, now, please.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.578
Well, not a day goes by
that I don't miss her.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.998
I said I don't want to talk about Mom.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.877
She had hope. I'm just...
I'm just saying. And so did you.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.421
I lost the baby, Dad.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.300
There's no more chances.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.301
Uh...

27:16.760 --> 27:18.928
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.263
Dad, don't.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.431
Just, please.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.141
Don't.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.729
I'm your father, Eva.

27:28.229 --> 27:31.358
-I'm... here for you.
-Dad, stop. Don't talk about Mom...

27:32.150 --> 27:33.360
like you loved her.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.405
We don't get to rewrite history, Dad.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.491
Some things
you just can't go back and change.

27:39.574 --> 27:43.161
Right? So there's no hope.
Don't talk to me about hope.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.247
And whether you meant to or not,
you brought me up to be just like you.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.334
Pragmatic and selfish.
And you weren't there for Mom.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.545
And I wasn't there for Ben.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.298
So don't talk to me about hope,

27:55.382 --> 27:58.885

or the goddamn messiah.

how did you find this number?

I know you're a terrorist, and somehow
you've got Golshiri under your spell.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.541
Here. I'm going to help you because
you were clever enough to find me.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.712
You couldn't be more wrong.

Isn't this what Collier asked for?
Actionable intelligence?

What action's going to be taken?
