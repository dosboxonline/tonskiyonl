00:28.778 --> 00:30.113
I am Mantis.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.243
What are you doing?

00:35.869 --> 00:36.870
Smiling.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.707
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.543
Not if you do it like that.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.627
Oh.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.339
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

00:48.423 --> 00:52.218
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.430
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.892
Yes.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.609
That is called a practical joke!

01:10.111 --> 01:11.696
I liked it very much!

01:14.199 --> 01:15.867
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

01:15.950 --> 01:18.244
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.704
Your antennae, what are they for?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.582
They have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.752
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.546
You feel love.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.590
-For her!
-No!

01:32.592 --> 01:33.593
Okay.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.470
You must be so embarrassed!

01:36.805 --> 01:40.600
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.354
How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.941
Ego found me in my larva state.
Orphaned on my home world.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.069
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.237
So you're a pet?

01:53.571 --> 01:54.697
I suppose.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.827
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

01:59.035 --> 02:00.161
I am hideous?

02:00.245 --> 02:03.581
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.500
-But that's a good thing.
-Oh?

02:05.583 --> 02:08.711
When you're ugly and someone loves you,
you know they love you for who you are.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.214
Then I am certainly grateful to be ugly.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.216
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?

02:13.299 --> 02:18.388
The planet is Ego. A dog would not
invite a flea to live on its back.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.848
And you're not a flea?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.641
I'm a flea with a purpose.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.436
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.481
I help him sleep.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.736
Only we can remake the universe.
Come with me.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.324
Drax, Drax. Drax! Drax! We need to talk.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.412
I'm sorry.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.706
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.

02:44.789 --> 02:45.790
What?

02:46.040 --> 02:49.377
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.879
No, that's not what I...

02:52.964 --> 02:55.550
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.764
Who are you people? What is this place?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.349
Gamora, let her go!

03:03.433 --> 03:05.560
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?

03:05.643 --> 03:07.061
Oh, my God.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.231
The bodies are his children.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.359
Out of all my labors,
the most beguiling was

03:13.443 --> 03:17.488
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.

03:17.572 --> 03:22.160
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough to power the Expansion.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.954
How do we kill a Celestial?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
There's a center to him.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.458
It's in the caverns below the surface.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.380
He's coming.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.300
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

03:37.467 --> 03:41.095
When he wants.
He's too powerful. I can't!

03:41.888 --> 03:46.100
You don't have to believe in yourself
because I believe in you.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.067
Sleep!

04:08.998 --> 04:11.084
It's beautiful.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.835
It is.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.921
And so are you.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.758
On the inside.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.429
We are arriving.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.266
All right, Guardians,
don't forget this might be dangerous...

04:26.349 --> 04:27.934
so let's put on our mean faces.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.692
Wake.

04:39.696 --> 04:44.742
There are six stones out there.
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

04:44.826 --> 04:46.494
He stole the Space Stone from me.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.955
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.039
They're with the Avengers.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.250
-The Avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.459
Like Kevin Bacon?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.339
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.842
-Kick names, take ass.
-Yeah, that's right.

05:08.182 --> 05:12.145
You ever feel lost, just look into
the eyes of the people that you love.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.105
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.901
Why don't you want me to tell him?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.194
How does this thing work?

05:20.278 --> 05:22.155
He should know you are his sister.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.369
Our only connection is the source
of his greatest shame.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.372
I think not.
