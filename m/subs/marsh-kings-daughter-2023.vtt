01:51.053 --> 01:52.649
[person] <i>And the mother cried,</i>

01:52.785 --> 01:56.653
<i>"Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?"</i>

01:57.289 --> 01:59.020
<i>And the daughter said,</i>

01:59.155 --> 02:02.724
[daughter]
<i>"Is it me I see,
mirrored in yours?"</i>

02:48.536 --> 02:50.772
[insects buzzing]

02:52.506 --> 02:54.710
[birds chirping]

03:03.253 --> 03:04.555
[person] Helena.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.393
Come back.

03:37.026 --> 03:40.388
She's going to make you do
twice as many chores
when you get back.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.124
I don't mind the trade.

03:43.260 --> 03:46.267
Maybe if we're gone long enough,
she'll forget she's mad.

03:47.835 --> 03:49.369
Okay.

03:50.436 --> 03:52.735
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

04:09.121 --> 04:12.425
[birds chirping]

04:30.109 --> 04:31.138
It was here.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.072
Running or walking?

04:35.781 --> 04:39.250
[Helena] The strides are wider
than before.

04:39.385 --> 04:42.686
And deeper on the outsides.

04:48.226 --> 04:49.156
It was running.

04:49.292 --> 04:50.760
Why?

04:52.698 --> 04:54.834
Because it was scared
of something.

04:54.969 --> 04:56.436
Scared of what?

04:59.335 --> 05:00.572
Us.

05:02.341 --> 05:04.907
If you were afraid,

05:05.943 --> 05:08.745
running for your life,
where would you go?

05:29.503 --> 05:31.768
[Helena]
Where no one could see me.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.479
[whispering]
It's time you finished the hunt.

06:23.753 --> 06:24.816
[whispering] What if I miss?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.659
Then we go hungry tonight.

06:34.068 --> 06:35.001
[gunshot]

06:35.136 --> 06:37.735
[birds shrieking]

06:38.940 --> 06:40.133
[sighs]

06:42.871 --> 06:44.742
I didn't make a sound.

06:46.644 --> 06:48.845
So, what do you think happened?

06:58.027 --> 06:59.053
It smelled me.

07:07.269 --> 07:08.865
You won't need the fire.

07:18.712 --> 07:21.911
Helena,
come get what you earned today.

07:29.391 --> 07:31.450
[Helena] She's always mad at me.

07:31.585 --> 07:35.188
[parent] Oh, your mother
can't see happiness like we do.

08:16.264 --> 08:18.869
- [insects buzzing]
- [birds chirping]

08:35.756 --> 08:38.856

[mother panting]

08:45.827 --> 08:47.497
[parent] Okay.

08:47.633 --> 08:48.932
[mother] I'm fine.

08:49.602 --> 08:51.000
It's getting late.

08:56.839 --> 08:59.074
[bird whistle tootling]

09:10.290 --> 09:12.725
Helena, no more.

09:57.406 --> 09:58.666
Where's the rest of it?

09:58.802 --> 10:00.172
It's free now.

10:00.307 --> 10:02.341
[flies buzzing]

10:02.477 --> 10:04.710
It chewed its own leg off?

10:04.846 --> 10:07.747
Sacrificed what it had to,
to survive.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.178
[echoed gunshot]

10:11.747 --> 10:12.983

[wood creaking]

10:36.937 --> 10:39.405
[metal rattling]

10:59.968 --> 11:01.965
When can I keep mine
in the house like you do?

11:02.101 --> 11:04.633
When you're as good a hunter
as I am.

11:04.769 --> 11:05.934
Which will be never.

11:06.103 --> 11:08.203
- [parent growling]
- [Helena yelps]

11:08.804 --> 11:10.040
[Helena grunts]

11:11.072 --> 11:12.574
What do the marks say?

11:12.709 --> 11:13.976
They say,

11:14.279 --> 11:16.145
"When you're running
from an angry moose,

11:16.748 --> 11:19.586
beware of low branches."

11:19.722 --> 11:21.715

[yelping]

12:16.608 --> 12:18.009
[growling]

12:26.850 --> 12:28.151
I heard it crying.

12:29.558 --> 12:31.353
[parent] She's starving.

12:31.488 --> 12:34.958
Well, we have some
scraps inside. We could maybe--

12:35.094 --> 12:37.160
What happens
when those are gone?

12:38.828 --> 12:43.265
There's nothing more pure
than the instinct to survive.

12:44.968 --> 12:47.139
The wolf holds no pity.

12:47.909 --> 12:51.440
Just the desire
to live another day.

12:51.575 --> 12:55.508
What would you do to the wolf,
if you were starving?

12:58.717 --> 12:59.952
You're its prey.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.823
We all are.

13:06.757 --> 13:08.356
[pup whines]

13:10.059 --> 13:11.563
But what about the baby?

13:11.699 --> 13:13.665
Will suffer and die alone.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.429
Now, do what I say, Helena.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.138
- But if--
- Helena, move.

13:22.740 --> 13:23.976
[wolf yelps]

13:28.950 --> 13:31.280
You must always
protect your family.

13:38.022 --> 13:40.256
[indistinct arguing in distance]

14:03.380 --> 14:06.647
Nah.
This is one of my alone trips.

14:06.783 --> 14:09.188
- But I can help.
- No, come on.
You know the rules.

14:09.324 --> 14:11.589
I'll bring you back a surprise.
What kind of surprise?

14:11.725 --> 14:15.621
Kind of surprise
you're gonna have to
wait to find out what it is.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.860
Now, get on back there.

14:17.995 --> 14:19.229
I'll be home soon.

14:21.229 --> 14:23.464
[mother humming melody]

[birds screaming]

15:18.185 --> 15:20.422
[motor whirring]

15:40.376 --> 15:43.379
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

15:47.283 --> 15:48.648
Is your mom or dad around?

15:53.461 --> 15:54.719
Hey.

15:54.855 --> 15:57.022
Hope I'm not trespassing
or anything.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.758
Didn't know
anybody lived way out here.

16:01.864 --> 16:04.498
Been out for hours,
and I got all spun around. I--

16:04.634 --> 16:06.704
I can't find my way back
to the trail.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.239
[breathing shakily]

16:09.470 --> 16:11.473
No signal out here anywhere.

16:12.774 --> 16:14.677
Look, if you could just
point me toward--

16:14.812 --> 16:16.078
Help!

16:16.213 --> 16:18.183
Please. Before he gets back.

16:18.882 --> 16:20.119
What?

16:22.184 --> 16:23.382
What are we doing?

16:23.518 --> 16:25.056
What are-- What are you doing?

16:25.325 --> 16:26.552
[mother] Get on, Helena.
[motorist] Whoa. Hang on.

16:26.687 --> 16:28.224
- He'll be back soon.
- Who?

16:28.360 --> 16:30.427
- Please, we have to go. Now!
- I--

16:30.562 --> 16:32.364
- I don't wanna go!
- I can't just take you.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.862
I'm not even sure where we are.
That's why I'm--

16:33.997 --> 16:35.497
[gunshot]

16:36.703 --> 16:37.730
[choking]

16:41.476 --> 16:42.702
No!

16:57.155 --> 16:58.588
[parent] Helena!
No!

16:58.724 --> 16:59.686
Father!

17:02.695 --> 17:04.497
Father!

17:04.632 --> 17:06.197
[mother] Helena?

17:06.332 --> 17:07.826
- [Helena] Father!
- [mother] Helena?

17:09.199 --> 17:10.598
[Helena shouting] No!

17:13.201 --> 17:14.833
Stop! Stop!

17:27.721 --> 17:29.221
Somebody!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.521
Somebody!

17:37.799 --> 17:39.825
[electricity crackling]

18:26.010 --> 18:27.345
[door opens]

18:32.953 --> 18:34.220
Look who's awake.

18:35.022 --> 18:36.453
It's okay, Helena.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.621
Your mother's
just in the next room.

18:40.323 --> 18:41.488
Where's my father?

18:41.624 --> 18:45.131
He's not here. You're safe now.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.332
There's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

18:49.465 --> 18:50.698
Don't worry about that.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.603
[breathing heavily]

18:56.270 --> 18:57.204
[grunts]

18:57.339 --> 18:59.575
[people murmuring]

19:04.444 --> 19:05.680
[mother] Helena.

19:07.147 --> 19:10.017
We shouldn't be here.
I want to go home.

19:10.953 --> 19:13.655
- That wasn't our home.
- What did you do?

19:14.762 --> 19:17.629
What did you do?

19:17.765 --> 19:20.629
- I want Father.
- [whispering]
He can't be near us.

19:21.736 --> 19:22.895
Ever again.

19:24.906 --> 19:26.734
He took me, Helena.

19:27.906 --> 19:28.936
Jacob...

19:29.773 --> 19:32.272
kidnapped me
and took me to the woods.

19:32.407 --> 19:33.740
You're lying.

19:34.009 --> 19:37.177
You're a liar.
You have always been a liar.

19:37.312 --> 19:38.713
Father told me.

19:40.755 --> 19:42.582
Stop crying!

19:42.717 --> 19:44.521
You're not allowed to do that.

19:44.656 --> 19:46.622
[police officer]
We need to let your mother rest.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.591
Just for a few minutes.

19:49.393 --> 19:51.726
We'll be okay. Helena?

21:45.642 --> 21:48.414
Okay, we have to go. Come on.

21:53.615 --> 21:55.520
You did good. Come on.

21:57.488 --> 21:59.758
Okay, let's go this way.

21:59.894 --> 22:02.754
- [officer 1] There he is!
- [officer 2] Police! Don't move!

22:02.890 --> 22:04.324
[crying] Are we gonna go home?

22:04.459 --> 22:05.593
One day we will.

22:05.728 --> 22:07.631
[officer 3] Hey! Don't move!

22:11.072 --> 22:12.271
Back away from the girl.

No!
[police officer]
On your stomach!

22:14.908 --> 22:15.801
Now!

22:15.936 --> 22:17.474
He didn't do anything wrong.

22:17.610 --> 22:19.543
[police officer]
Let me see your hands.

22:19.679 --> 22:22.374
I'll come find you,
Little Shadow.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.747
[officer]
He's running! I got him!
[Jacob grunts]

22:24.882 --> 22:26.980

Hands behind your back!

[whispering] Shoot.

24:10.387 --> 24:12.624
[birds chirping]

24:17.231 --> 24:18.993
No running, Marigold.

24:21.101 --> 24:22.827
Hi, sweetie.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.968
Mrs. Haver said
she has a life of her own,
and if you're gonna be late,

24:27.104 --> 24:29.641
she's gonna
start charging you rent for me.

24:29.776 --> 24:32.075
She did, huh?
[Marigold] What does that mean?

24:32.210 --> 24:35.575
It means you are so valuable,
she thinks I should pay for you.

24:35.710 --> 24:37.277
Whatcha got here?

24:37.479 --> 24:39.747
My science project.
It's a habitat.
[Helena] Uh-huh.

24:39.882 --> 24:42.515
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

24:42.650 --> 24:44.451
A baby deer.

24:44.754 --> 24:49.258
It sleeps over here,
beside the rocks,
to keep it safe from hunters.

24:49.393 --> 24:50.691
Smart deer.

24:50.826 --> 24:52.493
[children laughing, chattering]

24:52.628 --> 24:53.962
[Marigold] Mommy!

24:55.666 --> 24:57.130
What kind of leaf is this?

24:57.731 --> 24:59.030
A walnut.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.871
From which tree?
You tell me.

25:02.977 --> 25:03.908
There.

25:04.044 --> 25:04.903
Mm-hmm.

25:05.072 --> 25:07.177
[Marigold] And what's that tree?

25:07.312 --> 25:08.512
A red oak.

25:08.647 --> 25:10.445
It doesn't look red to me.

25:10.581 --> 25:12.216
It will be in the fall.

25:12.352 --> 25:13.546
Do you see the bird?

25:13.682 --> 25:15.350
[bird singing]

25:15.486 --> 25:16.783
A wood thrush.

25:16.919 --> 25:19.489
How do you know all the names?

25:19.624 --> 25:21.956
I can teach you if you want.

25:22.091 --> 25:24.161
[Marigold]
I can see a bunny rabbit.

25:24.296 --> 25:25.929
[Helena] Where?

25:26.065 --> 25:29.933
You have to kind of
tilt your head. See the ears?

25:30.068 --> 25:32.938
Oh, yeah. I see it.
With the tail down this way?

25:33.073 --> 25:34.101
Yeah.

25:37.511 --> 25:40.074
[Jacob] It means that we're one.

25:42.379 --> 25:43.616
Family.

25:44.217 --> 25:45.816
[Marigold] Mom?

25:47.015 --> 25:49.214
When can I have one of these?

25:49.350 --> 25:51.049
[Helena]
Not until you're 82 years old.

25:51.184 --> 25:52.850
That's the rule, remember?

25:52.985 --> 25:54.218
That's not fair.

25:54.354 --> 25:56.421
You got them
when you were young.

25:56.557 --> 25:59.830
I was much older than you,
and I wish I hadn't.

26:00.563 --> 26:02.133
I like them.

26:02.268 --> 26:03.266
I like you.

26:03.401 --> 26:05.837

Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

26:23.255 --> 26:25.218
We're going to the campus
for Daddy's work picnic.

26:25.353 --> 26:26.789
[Marigold] Picnic?
Sorry we're late.

26:26.958 --> 26:28.153
I forgot about
your thing tonight.

26:28.288 --> 26:30.427
That's all right. Let's just go.

26:30.729 --> 26:33.159
I have to change. Why don't you
go on over with her,
and I'll come later.

26:33.294 --> 26:35.098
Well, we've tried that.
You never show.

26:35.267 --> 26:37.502
I'm just not good
at those things.
Neither am I.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.334
Which is why you're coming with.

26:39.470 --> 26:42.004
Plus, you're my beautiful wife,
and I want to show you off.

26:43.511 --> 26:46.239
[children laughing, screaming]

26:49.245 --> 26:50.681
[partygoer]
You know, it's funny.

26:50.950 --> 26:52.681
[Helena] Thank you.
[partygoer 2 laughs]

26:52.816 --> 26:54.615
Hey, you good?
Yeah.

26:54.751 --> 26:56.317
Is Marigold having fun?

26:56.452 --> 26:58.020
[partygoer 3] I don't know.
The crazy thing is,

26:58.322 --> 26:59.856
my students don't even try
to hide it anymore.

26:59.992 --> 27:01.619
Phones are going off
my entire lecture.

27:01.855 --> 27:04.657
Well, in their defense,
I have heard
some of your lectures.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.127
[all laugh]

27:08.030 --> 27:10.596
I love that. It's unusual.

27:10.732 --> 27:13.871
- Oh, thanks.
- [professor]
Did you get it around here?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.401
Uh, in San Francisco,
when I was a teenager.

27:18.446 --> 27:19.442
You have a bunch of them.

27:19.578 --> 27:21.077
Too many. [chuckles]

27:21.212 --> 27:23.479
I didn't know
you're from San Francisco.

27:23.615 --> 27:26.746
Other places too.
We moved around a lot.
What'd your parents do?

27:26.882 --> 27:29.986
My father worked in insurance,
my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

27:30.121 --> 27:32.824
Doesn't get much more boring
than that.

27:34.395 --> 27:36.061
[crickets chirping]

27:36.330 --> 27:39.028
[Helena]
"Then she took 20 mattresses
and laid them on the pea.

27:39.164 --> 27:42.460
On this, the princess
had to lie all night.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.600
In the morning
she was asked how she had slept.

27:45.736 --> 27:47.300
And the princess said...

27:52.439 --> 27:54.747
[whispered] 'Oh, very badly.'"

28:02.486 --> 28:03.723
[sighs]

28:07.955 --> 28:09.190

28:25.809 --> 28:28.044

28:42.296 --> 28:44.324

[breathing heavily]

30:23.795 --> 30:26.030
[police radio chatter]

30:29.465 --> 30:31.833
What's going on?
Where's my daughter?

30:31.969 --> 30:32.900
[person] Helena Erikkson?

30:33.035 --> 30:34.567
Where's Marigold?

30:34.736 --> 30:36.168
[person] She's not here.
This isn't about her.

30:36.304 --> 30:38.170
I'm Special Agent Illing.

30:38.305 --> 30:40.175
What are you doing in my house?

30:40.310 --> 30:42.781
Ms. Erikkson.
My name is Pelletier.

30:42.917 --> 30:45.381
Before that,
it was Jones, correct?

30:45.517 --> 30:48.012
Then Mitchell,
after you changed it
from Bekkum.

30:48.147 --> 30:52.056
But you were born
to Jacob Holbrook
and Beth Erikkson.

30:52.757 --> 30:54.087
What do you want?

30:54.222 --> 30:56.862
Your father, Jacob Holbrook.

30:56.998 --> 30:58.759
He and another prisoner
escaped last night

30:59.028 --> 31:02.433
while being transported
across the state line
to Alger Penitentiary.

31:03.136 --> 31:05.069
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

31:05.904 --> 31:07.633
When I was ten years old.

31:07.768 --> 31:10.103
- Has he tried
to contact you recently?
- No.

31:10.238 --> 31:11.836
Are you sure? Not even once?

31:12.038 --> 31:14.446
You could've called me.
You didn't need to come here.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.640
What's going on?

31:16.714 --> 31:18.412
You okay?

31:18.547 --> 31:20.414
Do you know where your father
might be going?

31:20.983 --> 31:22.283
Y-Your father?

31:22.452 --> 31:24.422
You can't just
come into my house.

31:24.691 --> 31:26.788
[Illing] Our warrant allows us
to check for any
possible communication

31:26.924 --> 31:28.423
to or from your father.

31:28.592 --> 31:30.527
Why do you keep saying that?
Helena's father--

31:30.695 --> 31:32.324
He doesn't know where I live,
doesn't know my last name,

31:32.459 --> 31:34.532
doesn't know anything about me.

31:34.701 --> 31:36.696
[Illing] And that's same
for your family
and friends? Have any of your--

31:36.832 --> 31:39.532
I've never told anyone
Jacob Holbrook is my father.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.139
[Illing] So, 20 years.

31:44.274 --> 31:47.839
No letter,
birthday card, anything?

31:47.975 --> 31:48.909
No.

31:49.044 --> 31:50.377
I'm confused.

31:50.646 --> 31:52.181
I thought your parents died
in a car accident.

31:52.316 --> 31:54.345
[whispering]
That's what I told you.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.917
And Holbrook,
that's the Marsh King guy.
The one that just escaped.

31:57.053 --> 31:58.755
I heard it on the radio.

31:58.891 --> 32:01.190
[Illing] That's right.

32:01.326 --> 32:03.061
Is there any risk
of him coming here?

32:03.196 --> 32:04.323
That's what we're trying
to find out.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.327
He doesn't know where I live.

32:06.463 --> 32:08.726
Oh,
you can't be too sure of that.

32:08.861 --> 32:11.269
Christ, Helena.
How could you not have told me?

32:12.039 --> 32:13.666
I told you to stay in the car, sweetie.

32:13.801 --> 32:16.636
- Who are these people?
- Police. They're just--

32:16.771 --> 32:18.571
I'm gonna take her.
I'll call you later.

32:21.243 --> 32:24.544
[Illing] We're gonna need to see
your phone
and any computers you use.

32:24.679 --> 32:27.118
With any luck,
your father will be found soon.

32:28.053 --> 32:29.683
You don't know my father.

32:29.886 --> 32:33.786
If he makes it to the wild,
you'll never see him again.

32:33.955 --> 32:36.255
[anchor] <i>In a case that received
nationwide notoriety,</i>

32:36.424 --> 32:39.929
<i>Jacob Holbrook,

33:28.649 --> 33:32.617
[Helena] I could bring her over

[spouse]
<i>I'm keeping her out tomorrow,
just in case.</i>

33:36.883 --> 33:38.350
I didn't think
this would happen.

33:38.485 --> 33:39.790
<i>That I'd find out?</i>

33:39.925 --> 33:42.194
No. I mean, I wish I--

33:42.329 --> 33:43.825
<i>Mari's yelling for me.
I gotta go.</i>

[line clicks]

35:11.215 --> 35:13.147
[Jacob] <i>Little Shadow.</i>

35:13.283 --> 35:14.950
Time to check our snares.

35:15.086 --> 35:16.815
And a real hunter...

35:18.892 --> 35:21.160
needs a real knife.

35:24.325 --> 35:25.824
This is yours now.

35:27.496 --> 35:29.597
Let's see how you do with it.

35:36.537 --> 35:38.771
[insects chirping, buzzing]

38:23.975 --> 38:25.003
Hi.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.941
I called earlier,
but you didn't answer.

38:29.711 --> 38:31.614
I'm not great with phones.

38:32.582 --> 38:33.946
That's an understatement.

38:35.350 --> 38:36.551
I saw the news.

38:36.853 --> 38:39.358
Thought I'd shoot down
and say hello.

38:40.224 --> 38:41.591
Hello, Clark.

38:41.859 --> 38:45.089
Maybe grab a glass of water
before I head back.

38:52.432 --> 38:53.669
[sighs]

38:59.711 --> 39:01.810
I know you
don't want me dropping in,

39:01.945 --> 39:04.515
but I figured
everything's changed a bit now.

39:05.383 --> 39:07.284
Cat's outta the bag.

39:07.419 --> 39:08.952
How's your husband taking it?

39:09.087 --> 39:10.455
Not well.

39:10.690 --> 39:13.051
He'll come around.
Just a matter of time.

39:14.627 --> 39:16.692
The little one's
not so little anymore.

39:17.961 --> 39:20.424
Your mother
would've loved to have met her.

39:21.494 --> 39:24.695
I thought you might bring
Marigold up home a while back,

39:24.831 --> 39:26.933
at least for the funeral.

39:27.068 --> 39:29.067
She wouldn't have
met her then either.

39:30.177 --> 39:31.874
That's true enough.

39:32.009 --> 39:34.545
Then, I guess I meant
I wish you woulda come sooner.

39:35.413 --> 39:36.778
She would've liked that.

39:41.818 --> 39:43.653
He still has that job
at the college?

39:45.251 --> 39:47.558
You still doing--
Nothing's changed.

39:48.061 --> 39:50.090
Okay. [sighs]

39:50.993 --> 39:53.325
This is not how I saw this
playing out.

39:54.328 --> 39:57.931
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I just can't do this right now.

40:06.008 --> 40:08.007
Well,
at least it's not in the press.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.575
No one's putting you with him.

40:11.711 --> 40:14.552
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't worried
about things.

40:15.153 --> 40:16.752
I'm not.

40:19.123 --> 40:22.621
You know, there was a space
when you were about 13 or so.

40:22.756 --> 40:27.125
I thought we had a shot at bei''
a nice little family,
the three of us.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.634
It was never the three of us, Clark.

40:31.437 --> 40:33.230
She didn't want me around.

40:33.365 --> 40:35.771
When she looked at me,
she saw my father.

40:36.372 --> 40:37.608
So did you.

40:38.076 --> 40:39.509
No.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.480
You're forgetting
some good days.

40:42.511 --> 40:43.911
She loved you.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.144
I still love you.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.916
I miss you.

40:51.089 --> 40:54.158
But sure, maybe sometimes
we saw a little Jacob in you.

40:54.293 --> 40:55.758
[vehicle approaching]

40:55.893 --> 40:58.189
Or maybe you never saw
enough of him in me.

41:01.432 --> 41:03.965
[police radio chatter]

41:05.469 --> 41:08.336
[Clark]
You here to relieve this fella?
[officer] No, I'm supposed to--

41:08.471 --> 41:12.341
Mrs. Pelletier,
the FBI would like you
to come down to the office.

41:12.476 --> 41:13.671
Did something come up?

41:13.807 --> 41:15.173
Way above my pay grade.

41:16.581 --> 41:17.978
You want me to come with you?

41:19.584 --> 41:21.619
We found your father's body.

41:22.949 --> 41:24.756
Just inside the state line.

41:24.892 --> 41:27.551
We assume they were heading
for a crossing to Canada.

41:27.687 --> 41:30.220
Guard rail,
60 feet up on the embankment
was splintered.

41:30.356 --> 41:32.793
Driver either lost control
or fell asleep.

41:32.928 --> 41:35.127
The car hit a tree
and caught fire.

41:35.262 --> 41:37.935
Both men were burned
beyond recognition.

41:38.071 --> 41:41.067
We think they had an accomplice.
We're looking for him now.

41:42.269 --> 41:44.103
How can you be sure
it's Holbrook?

41:47.806 --> 41:52.111
He has three gold teeth
with carvings
matching your father.

41:55.286 --> 41:57.116
[inhales deeply]

41:58.521 --> 41:59.756
You all right?

42:02.791 --> 42:04.695
My father died 20 years ago.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.687
[car approaching]

42:38.462 --> 42:40.060
[Helena] Mmm.

42:41.193 --> 42:43.397
I'm sorry about your daddy.

42:43.532 --> 42:45.564
We saw it on TV.

42:45.700 --> 42:49.137
Thank you, sweetie,
but he wasn't my daddy
for a long time.

42:49.273 --> 42:52.303
We brought you some food
in case you didn't wanna cook.

42:53.073 --> 42:55.605
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

42:55.741 --> 42:58.980
- I'm definitely in the mood
for pizza.
- Yes!

43:02.552 --> 43:03.952
How you doing?

43:04.521 --> 43:05.756
I'm fine.

43:09.391 --> 43:12.125
I wish you would've told me
the truth. [sighs]

43:13.558 --> 43:15.733
What's the worst
that could've happened?

43:17.333 --> 43:19.935
- We wouldn't have Mari.
- You don't know that.

43:20.569 --> 43:22.403
Yes, I do.

43:22.539 --> 43:26.036
Who in their right mind
would get involved
with the daughter...

43:26.172 --> 43:30.679
If you knew my name
was Holbrook, you'd never have
gone on a date with me.

43:30.814 --> 43:32.509
You would've run the other way.

43:33.245 --> 43:35.450
- You will now.
- Hold on.

43:36.786 --> 43:39.989
Let's pretend
that I'm a better person
than you think I am, all right?

43:40.125 --> 43:42.157
What's the best thing
that could've happened?

43:43.027 --> 43:45.423
You might've found
somebody to trust.

43:45.558 --> 43:49.999
Someone to help you through
all the shitty days.

43:50.134 --> 43:52.902
Somebody to explain
all your weird tattoos to.

43:59.204 --> 44:01.141
The best never happens, Stephen.

44:01.877 --> 44:03.715
No matter how badly we want it.

44:25.901 --> 44:27.799
Marigold okay?
Yeah.

44:27.934 --> 44:29.169
She's asleep.

44:30.642 --> 44:32.073
Do you really believe that?

44:34.680 --> 44:36.242
What you said before about...

44:38.045 --> 44:39.610
the best never happening.

44:40.913 --> 44:44.151
[inhales sharply]
Because if you do,
what's that mean for us?

44:46.786 --> 44:51.396
Look I--
I don't wanna make
this any worse for you.

44:51.531 --> 44:54.062
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

44:59.635 --> 45:02.873
Okay, look.
I'm gonna go do some work
at the office.

45:04.874 --> 45:06.371
Probably sleep over there.

45:12.214 --> 45:15.281
[footsteps departing]
[door closes]

45:22.228 --> 45:23.256
[sighs]

45:41.040 --> 45:42.346
[tires screeching]

45:42.481 --> 45:43.881
[exhales sharply]

45:52.152 --> 45:53.990
My name is Helena Holbrook.

45:56.259 --> 45:58.555
Remember the guy
who kidnapped that woman?

45:59.492 --> 46:02.130
The one everybody called
The Marsh King?

46:03.932 --> 46:05.166
I'm his daughter.

46:11.508 --> 46:16.278
Sometimes I sneak off alone
at night because I feel trapped.

46:16.413 --> 46:20.577
Like I can't figure out
which world I really belong in.

46:26.421 --> 46:29.390
I have trouble trusting people because...

46:30.660 --> 46:34.459
everyone tells me
the person I believed
in the most

46:35.161 --> 46:36.868
was really a monster.

46:41.908 --> 46:44.403
He gave me this
after my first kill.

46:54.951 --> 46:56.580
And this one when I missed.

46:59.586 --> 47:01.959
This is the place
he taught me to swim.

47:03.825 --> 47:05.622
[sniffles]

47:09.635 --> 47:10.968
The name he gave me.

47:13.402 --> 47:16.435
This to remind me never to wait
to do my chores.

47:21.512 --> 47:25.015
These were the only tears
my father ever wanted to see.

47:30.089 --> 47:32.484
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

48:01.649 --> 48:04.186
[Stephen] Come on. I know.
[Marigold] I can do it.

48:04.321 --> 48:06.488
I have been looking forward
to this day.

48:06.624 --> 48:09.058
Thought it was time
to introduce you
to a couple people.

48:09.194 --> 48:11.055
[Marigold] Look, Daddy,
they have horses.

48:11.257 --> 48:14.828
This is Clark.
He's gonna try his best
to get you to call him Grandpa.

48:14.963 --> 48:16.426
Make him earn it.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.595
That doesn't scare me a bit.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.399
I've got no one else
to spend it on.

48:20.535 --> 48:23.000
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

48:23.135 --> 48:24.540
You too, Clark.

48:24.675 --> 48:25.972
[Clark chuckles]

48:26.108 --> 48:27.339
I'm gonna like this one.

48:27.475 --> 48:29.706
Would you like
to see the horses?

48:47.194 --> 48:49.726
[humming in distance]

49:13.759 --> 49:16.192
[humming continues]

49:24.933 --> 49:26.169
[humming stops]

49:29.909 --> 49:31.471
[Clark] Who's getting hungry?

49:40.212 --> 49:41.279
[Clark chuckles]

49:41.414 --> 49:43.317
Two hours after I took that,

49:43.453 --> 49:45.849
I started getting calls
that some hoodlum

49:45.984 --> 49:48.590
was setting off fireworks
in people's yards.

49:48.725 --> 49:52.024
She tore that dress to shreds,
running from one of my deputies.

49:52.159 --> 49:53.893
You can stop now.

49:54.028 --> 49:56.160
Oh, hell, we haven't even got
to your difficult stage yet.

49:56.295 --> 49:58.102
Who's that?

50:00.335 --> 50:02.304
[Clark] That's your grandmother.

50:04.108 --> 50:05.703
You definitely take after her.

50:08.079 --> 50:09.912
I don't remember that picture.

50:10.047 --> 50:12.083
[Marigold] It looks like us.

50:16.984 --> 50:20.289
You know, I wouldn't complain
if this became a habit.

50:28.129 --> 50:29.364
Thank you, Clark.

50:29.964 --> 50:31.201
Anytime.

50:31.966 --> 50:33.501
Hey.

50:33.704 --> 50:36.766
You know,
Jacob took a lot
of my people's beliefs,

50:36.901 --> 50:40.441
twisted 'em
to fit what suited him.

50:43.545 --> 50:46.744
Means "owned" in Ojibwa.
Not "family."

50:47.579 --> 50:48.779
Don't confuse the two.

51:17.546 --> 51:19.276
- [Stephen gasps]
- [tires screeching]

51:19.412 --> 51:21.779
Sh-- [breathes heavily]

51:54.546 --> 51:56.253
[Jacob] Little Shadow.

52:07.226 --> 52:08.463
[gasps]

52:11.366 --> 52:12.632
[Stephen] What's wrong?

52:15.069 --> 52:16.471
[sighs]

52:17.274 --> 52:19.705
I'm just getting some water.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.680
[door opens]

52:58.884 --> 53:00.845
[breathes heavily]

54:28.041 --> 54:32.104
[sighs] Hey,
make sure you wipe your feet
when you come in the house.

54:32.239 --> 54:33.509
I did.

54:34.444 --> 54:35.841
I'll drop her on the way.

54:36.344 --> 54:37.877
See you after.

54:38.113 --> 54:39.813
We'll go swimming or something.
Don't forget my goggles.

54:39.948 --> 54:42.314
I got that conference
in Detroit this afternoon.

54:42.450 --> 54:43.684
Might be home late.

54:44.817 --> 54:46.049
You gonna be okay?
Mmm.

54:52.491 --> 54:54.497
[chattering]

54:57.529 --> 54:58.765
Thank you.

55:04.106 --> 55:05.204
Helena?

55:05.340 --> 55:06.740
How you doing?

55:07.407 --> 55:09.213
Good. Fine.

55:09.349 --> 55:10.943
Are you guys
around this weekend?

55:11.079 --> 55:13.477
I was thinking Jess and Marigold
could have a playdate.

55:13.612 --> 55:17.619
Oh, yeah.
I think we're free, just...
[birdcall whistling]

55:21.788 --> 55:24.191
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

55:24.326 --> 55:26.828
How's Saturday?
Would she like
to come over to our place?

55:26.964 --> 55:30.265
Of course.
She has swim until 10:00
but after that...

55:30.401 --> 55:32.700
[birdcall whistling continues]

55:42.445 --> 55:44.877
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

56:33.459 --> 56:34.696
[grunts]

57:02.657 --> 57:04.520
You're not helping.

57:04.655 --> 57:08.526
I'm not supposed to help.
This is your homework, not mine.

57:08.662 --> 57:09.892
But you always help.

57:10.028 --> 57:12.136
Well, you can figure this out.

57:12.271 --> 57:15.231
Why are you in a bad mood again?

57:15.700 --> 57:16.936
I'm not.

57:18.211 --> 57:19.405
I don't mean to be.

57:20.609 --> 57:23.673
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy
to help us finish
in the morning.

57:23.809 --> 57:25.747
Okay?
Okay.

57:29.515 --> 57:32.521
[Helena] "Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool

57:32.657 --> 57:35.252
like a carpet patterned
with flowers.

57:35.387 --> 57:38.656
And on this carpet,
lay a young and beautiful woman.

57:38.792 --> 57:44.431
The mother cried,
'Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

57:44.567 --> 57:46.097
And the daughter said..."

57:48.938 --> 57:51.740
Hey, daughter?
You missed your entrance.

58:27.740 --> 58:29.305
[Beth] <i>Helena.</i>

58:41.420 --> 58:43.925
[young Helena] What is it?
It's a doll.

58:44.461 --> 58:47.598
You-- You play with it.

58:48.431 --> 58:49.666
Like a friend.

58:56.308 --> 58:57.300
She has hair like me.

58:58.639 --> 59:00.006
A tiny Helena.

59:03.512 --> 59:04.747
[bell tinkles]

59:22.795 --> 59:26.263
[breathes heavily]

59:40.813 --> 59:42.180
[bell tinkles]

59:58.764 --> 01:00:00.000
[rustles]

01:00:21.523 --> 01:00:22.759
[door slams]

01:00:24.591 --> 01:00:25.993
Oh, God.

01:00:28.299 --> 01:00:29.392
Marigold!

01:00:30.399 --> 01:00:31.427
[grunts]

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.102
[gasps, grunts]

01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:35.238
Helena!

01:00:35.373 --> 01:00:36.499
Hey, it's me.

01:00:36.868 --> 01:00:37.800
It's me.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.171
[panting]

01:00:40.841 --> 01:00:42.039
Jesus. What are you...

01:00:42.174 --> 01:00:45.145
Uh... I--
Whose blood is that?

01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:48.583
No one's. A rabbit.
I heard somebody outside.

01:00:48.718 --> 01:00:50.316
Maybe try calling the police

01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:53.082
instead of running around
in the dark
with a knife.

01:00:53.218 --> 01:00:57.393
- [panting] I have to check
on Marigold.
- Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

01:00:57.528 --> 01:00:58.621
I just left her room.

01:00:59.257 --> 01:01:00.593
Did you see anyone out there?

01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:03.428
[panting continues]

01:01:03.564 --> 01:01:05.066
Hey.

01:01:05.302 --> 01:01:07.536
We're gonna keep
the doors locked,
all right?

01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:09.300
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:13.073
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:43.007 --> 01:01:45.206
[Helena] <i>It was bleeding
from the head.</i>

01:01:45.342 --> 01:01:48.911
Like someone killed it first,
then put it in the snare.

01:01:49.914 --> 01:01:52.678
Or maybe it got injured
some other way.

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:57.179
What's got you spooked?
Why do you think
there's something more?

01:01:57.314 --> 01:01:59.757
I feel like he's here.

01:01:59.892 --> 01:02:02.658
[inhales deeply]
<i>The night you found us,</i>

01:02:02.793 --> 01:02:04.355
<i>when we came out of the woods,</i>

01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:07.226
I was so afraid
because he wasn't there with me.

01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:10.094
But then he came.

01:02:10.229 --> 01:02:11.931
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:13.903
<i>Now he's come back again.</i>

01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:16.533
<i>I have to tell him
to leave us alone.</i>

01:02:16.668 --> 01:02:19.770
You have got to try to get him
out of your head.

01:02:19.905 --> 01:02:21.072
For good.

01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:23.512
[sighs] I'm not sure
I can do that.

01:02:23.647 --> 01:02:25.311
How could he be alive?

01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:27.147
I don't know.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.886
[Jacob] <i>There's nothing purer
than the instinct to survive.</i>

01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:38.323
[wolf whines]

01:02:39.529 --> 01:02:40.930
[growling]

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.017
[Marigold] Mommy!

01:03:03.652 --> 01:03:05.515
[Helena panting]

01:03:06.787 --> 01:03:08.023
Marigold?

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.557
I couldn't find my backpack.

01:03:12.693 --> 01:03:13.963
[sighs]

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:17.560
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:20.232
I wanna show people.

01:03:20.368 --> 01:03:22.436
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:23.973
Okay.

01:03:33.717 --> 01:03:35.147
Where did you get those?

01:03:35.283 --> 01:03:38.015
I thought you made them.
I like them.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.088
Looks like you and me.

01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:47.095
- [birds chirping]
- [wings flapping]

01:03:50.895 --> 01:03:53.904
Has the habitat been
in your room
the whole time?

01:03:54.801 --> 01:03:56.104
Mm-hmm.

01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.089
[breathes heavily]

01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:15.024
What are you doing?

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.560
[keys jingling]

01:04:24.666 --> 01:04:25.936
Come on.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.301
[Helena]
<i>Stay inside after school
unless Daddy</i>

01:04:32.604 --> 01:04:37.112
<i>or I are here, okay?
Don't go with anyone else,
no matter what they say.</i>

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.034
What's this about?

01:05:04.169 --> 01:05:05.469
Just felt like it.

01:05:05.704 --> 01:05:08.303
<i>Can you pick Marigold up
after school?</i>

01:05:08.439 --> 01:05:10.673
[Stephen] <i>Of course.</i>

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:12.412
<i>Why?</i>

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:17.152
[Helena] <i>I have to do something.
I can't tell you what it is.</i>

01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:25.226
[Stephen]
<i>What's going on, Helena?</i>

01:05:26.696 --> 01:05:30.363
[Helena]
<i>I know I haven't given you
any reason to...</i>

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.432
<i>please trust me.</i>

01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:36.303
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

01:05:37.205 --> 01:05:38.635
[Stephen] <i>Back from where?</i>

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:41.638
[Helena] <i>Last secret, Stephen.</i>

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:44.080
<i>Promise.</i>

01:06:04.329 --> 01:06:06.531
You and Mari rescued me.

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:12.855
[young Helena]
<i>I can call it anything I want?</i>

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:15.759
[Jacob] It's yours.
I gave it to you.

01:08:19.836 --> 01:08:21.171
I name it

01:08:22.004 --> 01:08:23.569
Helena Falls.

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.229
[footsteps approaching]

01:10:29.365 --> 01:10:31.301
[Jacob] Hello, Little Shadow.

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:08.833
[chuckles]

01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:14.069
[inhales sharply]

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:17.677
Let's go for a walk.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.495
How did you find me?

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.699
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

01:11:47.779 --> 01:11:49.379
[sighs]

01:11:51.477 --> 01:11:53.350
I miss that smell.

01:11:56.482 --> 01:11:57.915
And the taste.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.887
Gimme that.

01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.835
My favorite knife.

01:12:31.119 --> 01:12:32.147
[scoffs]

01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:41.563
We used to come camping up here,
you remember?

01:12:42.533 --> 01:12:45.330
We'd lay out here
all summer long.

01:12:45.466 --> 01:12:46.765
Look up at the sky,

01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:48.636
see who could count
the most shooting stars.

01:12:49.573 --> 01:12:51.573
I used to cheat
and count airplanes.

01:12:52.075 --> 01:12:53.905
[chuckles]

01:12:55.242 --> 01:12:58.946
You knew I was alive
the whole time,
didn't you?

01:12:59.749 --> 01:13:01.682
I didn't know
how it was possible.

01:13:02.652 --> 01:13:05.081
Not until I saw
a three-legged coyote.

01:13:06.689 --> 01:13:08.817
Sacrificed its own leg
for freedom.

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:11.320
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

01:13:11.456 --> 01:13:13.495
Ah.

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:15.728
Probably won't pass
a medical exam,

01:13:15.864 --> 01:13:18.028
but it bought you
the time you needed.

01:13:19.665 --> 01:13:21.438
You did some digging.

01:13:22.105 --> 01:13:23.704
Well done.

01:13:28.944 --> 01:13:31.481
You didn't tell anyone else
your theory?

01:13:33.445 --> 01:13:34.847
Did you?

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:42.085
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

01:13:43.459 --> 01:13:45.190
Tell me about my granddaughter.

01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:49.191
I don't think so.
You know enough
about her already.

01:13:52.765 --> 01:13:54.603
Well, I had to take a peek.

01:13:56.739 --> 01:13:58.805
You never brought her
to visit me.

01:14:00.609 --> 01:14:02.237
You didn't visit me at all.

01:14:06.679 --> 01:14:07.909
Come on, Little Shadow.

01:14:08.045 --> 01:14:09.816
I want to show you something.

01:14:12.523 --> 01:14:15.822
You know,
Marigold looks like her.

01:14:16.423 --> 01:14:17.420
Your mother.

01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.794
I bet she loves the water
as much as we do.

01:14:25.703 --> 01:14:27.735
That's to take us
across the border.

01:14:28.369 --> 01:14:29.704
The three of us.

01:14:30.707 --> 01:14:32.806
To Canada,
we can be a family again.

01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:34.703
I have a family.

01:14:34.839 --> 01:14:36.209
You have a daughter.

01:14:36.345 --> 01:14:37.647
And a husband.

01:14:38.416 --> 01:14:39.714
We've built a life together.

01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:42.211
Are you happy with that life?

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:45.817
Not always.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.054
Do you ever think
back to what it was like

01:14:48.523 --> 01:14:49.622
when we lived here?

01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:53.530
- I do.
- We can have it all again.

01:14:56.129 --> 01:14:59.101
I remember
when you were four years old,

01:14:59.237 --> 01:15:01.067
you could shut your eyes

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:06.374
and you knew where you were
from the sound of the water,

01:15:06.509 --> 01:15:09.370
from the smell of the trees,

01:15:09.506 --> 01:15:14.083
and the feel of the ground
beneath your feet.

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:15.915
It was like magic.

01:15:19.323 --> 01:15:21.090
This is where we belong.

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:23.054
It's our home.

01:15:23.557 --> 01:15:25.023
Our life here

01:15:26.097 --> 01:15:27.223
was perfect.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:31.227
[birds squawking]

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:40.240
[water splashing]

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.476
[Beth] No!

01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:46.316
[water splashing]
[Beth struggling]

01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:47.782
[Jacob grunts]
[Beth] No!

01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:54.383
[Jacob] Don't you ever run away
from me again!

01:15:54.885 --> 01:15:56.692
Okay? You hear me?

01:15:59.659 --> 01:16:01.064
[Beth gasping]

01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:02.258
I wasn't--

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:06.196
[gasping, crying]

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.168
Perfect?

01:16:12.837 --> 01:16:14.073
Not for my mother.

01:16:14.643 --> 01:16:16.175
Well, it could've been.

01:16:16.311 --> 01:16:17.408
How?

01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:21.743
- You kidnapped her.
- No. We ran away together.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:25.282
That's just something she said
when she decided to leave.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:28.049
- You shot that man.
- I was trying to hit the engine.

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:29.659
You never would have missed.

01:16:30.722 --> 01:16:32.356
I missed.

01:16:32.492 --> 01:16:35.727
[scoffs]
You've been told a bunch
of stories about me.

01:16:35.862 --> 01:16:40.065
They're not true.
I never was the Marsh King,
until they said I was.

01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:44.674
I know this, we were happy.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.874
You were happy.

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:51.345
All I'm saying, bring Marigold,
let her see for herself.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.946
I can't do that.

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:55.311
I won't.

01:16:56.886 --> 01:16:58.721
I'm sorry.
This is where it ends.

01:17:00.855 --> 01:17:02.923
I shouldn't have come here.

01:17:05.923 --> 01:17:07.796
I'm glad I did.

01:17:11.868 --> 01:17:14.696
Now I have to go home
to my family.

01:17:15.432 --> 01:17:18.404
Please don't come
near them again.

01:17:19.274 --> 01:17:22.041
- It doesn't need to be
like this.
- It does.

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:28.245
Okay.

01:17:28.746 --> 01:17:29.844
Okay.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.853
I understand.

01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:41.863
You'll always be
my Little Shadow.

01:17:45.798 --> 01:17:47.297
I have to go.

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:25.269
Clark?

01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:29.843
- What are you doing here?
- Could ask you the same thing.

01:18:29.978 --> 01:18:32.210
Stephen called me.
He was worried.

01:18:32.345 --> 01:18:35.280
And I just had a hunch
after what you said.

01:18:36.717 --> 01:18:40.047
- Is he here?
- Let's go back.
I'll tell you on the way.

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:43.089
Helena, was he here?

01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:45.993
But he's gone.

01:18:48.828 --> 01:18:50.294
[hammer cocks]

01:18:51.235 --> 01:18:52.131
[shouts]

01:18:52.764 --> 01:18:54.364
[grunts]

01:19:00.972 --> 01:19:02.711
Clark. Clark.

01:19:02.847 --> 01:19:05.848
[Clark wheezes]
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:19:08.717 --> 01:19:10.519
Clark, look at me, okay?

01:19:10.654 --> 01:19:12.386
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

01:19:12.721 --> 01:19:15.784
You told him
you were coming here?
No, I didn't say anything.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.559
Please, look at me.

01:19:17.694 --> 01:19:19.554
Clark, I'm right here.

01:19:21.096 --> 01:19:23.126
Clark, hold on.
Please, Clark, hold on.

01:19:23.261 --> 01:19:25.127
You must've said something.

01:19:25.263 --> 01:19:27.134
Make your stepfather curious.

01:19:27.269 --> 01:19:30.202
Enough to wander out here
all this way by himself.

01:19:30.337 --> 01:19:32.974
Just get away from us.
What have you done?

01:19:34.876 --> 01:19:37.011
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.881
Come on. Please.

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:41.178
Well, there's nothing you can do
to help him now.

01:19:41.314 --> 01:19:44.150
- [Helena screams, cries]
- [Jacob grunts]

01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:47.856
No!

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:50.222
You'd rather the wolf lived
than us?

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:54.623
You want it to feed you
to its pup?

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.928
Now I have to get Marigold
on my own.

01:19:58.064 --> 01:20:00.500
No! Don't you touch her!

01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:02.366
[struggling]

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.868
[screams, grunts]

01:20:06.003 --> 01:20:07.470
[panting]

01:20:10.143 --> 01:20:13.015
We can still all be a family.

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:14.543
It's all I want.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:17.385
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.251
No! No, no.

01:20:21.325 --> 01:20:22.353
No!

01:20:23.393 --> 01:20:24.421
No!

01:20:26.496 --> 01:20:28.260
[whimpering]

01:20:33.399 --> 01:20:37.269
[thudding]
[whimpering continues]

01:20:51.488 --> 01:20:53.516
[wolf howls]

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.433
[footsteps approaching]

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:06.903
[Beth] Helena.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.673
Wrap the rope around you.

01:21:20.949 --> 01:21:22.480
Did he say I could come up?

01:21:22.649 --> 01:21:24.947
I don't care,
I'm getting you out of there.

01:21:25.082 --> 01:21:27.385
[both grunting]

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:34.458
I've got you, my Helena.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.560
You're gonna be fine.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.234
Because you're stronger than me.

01:21:42.737 --> 01:21:44.039
Braver than me.

01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:50.507
[exhales sharply, grunts]

01:22:04.891 --> 01:22:06.589
[grunting]

01:22:15.365 --> 01:22:17.039
[grunting continues]

01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:25.410
[groans]

01:22:30.521 --> 01:22:33.286
[panting]

01:22:43.226 --> 01:22:45.595
[wood creaking]

01:22:46.031 --> 01:22:48.268
[panting]

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:52.305
[grunting]

01:22:59.616 --> 01:23:01.248
[wood creaking]

01:23:02.179 --> 01:23:03.514
[grunting]

01:23:06.854 --> 01:23:08.156
[screams]

01:23:15.697 --> 01:23:16.791
[coughs]

01:23:20.164 --> 01:23:22.401
[grunting]

01:23:25.641 --> 01:23:27.076
Please.

01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:31.377
Clark.

01:23:36.785 --> 01:23:38.615
[sobbing]

01:23:42.957 --> 01:23:44.687
I'm so sorry.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.506
I'll come back for you.

01:24:06.309 --> 01:24:08.447
[grunting]

01:24:14.021 --> 01:24:15.850
[breathes heavily]

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:23.099
[grunting]

01:24:30.905 --> 01:24:32.867
[panting]

01:25:05.174 --> 01:25:07.572
[Jacob] <i>All rivers bend, Helena.</i>

01:26:25.151 --> 01:26:26.948
[panting]

01:26:48.538 --> 01:26:50.004
[Jacob grunts]

01:27:43.698 --> 01:27:45.929
[Jacob] <i>Is the blood warm
or cold?</i>

01:27:46.832 --> 01:27:48.136
Cold.
[young Helena] <i>Cold.</i>

01:27:48.405 --> 01:27:50.900
[Jacob]
<i>Then you must move faster.</i>

01:28:33.414 --> 01:28:35.384
<i>Running or walking?</i>

01:28:39.617 --> 01:28:41.390
[young Helena] <i>Running.</i>

01:28:43.359 --> 01:28:45.125
[Jacob] <i>And if you were afraid,</i>

01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:46.990
<i>running for your life,</i>

01:28:47.593 --> 01:28:49.123
<i>where would you run?</i>

01:28:54.132 --> 01:28:56.537
[young Helena]
<i>To where no one could see me.</i>

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.948
You know what you taught me.

01:30:11.575 --> 01:30:12.811
[rustling]

01:30:13.746 --> 01:30:15.748
[birds chirping]
[wings flapping]

01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:20.819
[rustling continues]

01:31:03.594 --> 01:31:06.062
[gasps, grunts]

01:31:09.037 --> 01:31:11.837
[Jacob] You're fine,
it's just a flesh wound.

01:31:12.338 --> 01:31:13.334
Now...

01:31:14.037 --> 01:31:15.910
what good will it do Marigold

01:31:16.045 --> 01:31:20.076
if her mother is lying rotting
in the bottom of the marsh?

01:31:20.579 --> 01:31:22.111
She needs you.

01:31:23.446 --> 01:31:26.118
Just think about
what's best for your daughter.

01:31:26.253 --> 01:31:27.281
Okay?

01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:29.756
[Helena] No!

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.660
[grunts] No!

01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:37.258
[panting]
The boat you came in. Show me.

01:32:22.276 --> 01:32:23.304
Go on.

01:32:25.276 --> 01:32:27.880
I waited my whole life
to see you again.

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.317
I wasn't sure what I would feel
when I did.

01:32:32.453 --> 01:32:35.089
- What do you feel,
Little Shadow?
- Don't call me that.

01:32:35.224 --> 01:32:36.219
Not anymore.

01:32:37.489 --> 01:32:40.255
I used to think you said it
because I was always beside you.

01:32:41.696 --> 01:32:43.627
Now I realize you just meant,

01:32:43.762 --> 01:32:47.065
like any shadow,
I wouldn't exist
if you weren't standing there.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:50.303
Your mother did a job on you
after I was gone.

01:32:50.438 --> 01:32:51.973
No, she didn't.

01:32:52.742 --> 01:32:54.602
I barely spoke
to her my whole life.

01:32:55.605 --> 01:32:58.476
I blamed her for everything too.
I never believed her.

01:32:58.611 --> 01:33:03.616
You really think she cared
about you
the way I care about you?

01:33:03.752 --> 01:33:06.017
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

01:33:08.589 --> 01:33:10.153
She could have run.

01:33:11.293 --> 01:33:12.727
Gotten away.

01:33:13.793 --> 01:33:15.697
She stayed to protect me.

01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:19.562
Now I know,
she was the strong one.

01:33:19.698 --> 01:33:21.331
She was weak.

01:33:21.467 --> 01:33:22.529
No.

01:33:23.665 --> 01:33:27.835
A man who drags a woman
into the wilderness is weak.

01:33:27.971 --> 01:33:30.943
Careful, Little Shadow.

01:33:32.916 --> 01:33:38.215
You forget all the things
that I did for you.

01:33:38.884 --> 01:33:41.951
The years I spent in a cage

01:33:42.086 --> 01:33:45.056
'cause I came back for you.

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:48.290
What would you do for Marigold?

01:34:01.542 --> 01:34:02.975
I'd die for her.

01:34:23.728 --> 01:34:25.360
[screams]

01:34:33.275 --> 01:34:34.604
Daddy!

01:34:34.739 --> 01:34:35.975
[gasping]

01:34:40.812 --> 01:34:43.015
Come on. Come on.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.887
- [Helena grunts, shouts]
- [Jacob shouts]

01:34:49.955 --> 01:34:51.826
[both shouting, grunting]

01:35:27.759 --> 01:35:31.998
[Helena] <i>"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool</i>

01:35:32.133 --> 01:35:34.663
<i>like a carpet patterned
with flowers.</i>

01:35:34.799 --> 01:35:39.638
<i>And on this carpet lay
a strong and beautiful woman.</i>

01:35:39.774 --> 01:35:46.414
The mother cried,
'Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?'

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:48.146
And the daughter said..."

01:35:48.879 --> 01:35:50.412
"Is it me I see,

01:35:51.752 --> 01:35:53.218
mirrored in yours?"

01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.887
"Then the child rose
in the shape of a mighty swan

01:35:57.022 --> 01:35:59.423
and spread her powerful wings."

01:35:59.559 --> 01:36:00.796
[gasps]

01:36:06.063 --> 01:36:08.463

[groans]

01:36:30.789 --> 01:36:32.025

01:36:40.032 --> 01:36:41.969
- [shouts]
- [grunts]

01:36:58.148 --> 01:36:59.921
I don't hate you.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:02.887
I don't pity you.

01:37:03.022 --> 01:37:05.289
I just remember your lesson.

01:37:07.059 --> 01:37:08.890
Always protect my family.

01:37:09.026 --> 01:37:10.426
[Jacob shouts]

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:28.642
[whimpering]

01:37:29.946 --> 01:37:31.183
