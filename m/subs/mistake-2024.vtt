00:12.316 --> 00:14.884
[sombre music]

00:50.311 --> 00:52.487
[indistinct hospital

01:02.801 --> 01:05.326
[indistinct hospital
PA announcement]

01:20.297 --> 01:22.821
[phone vibrates]

01:33.180 --> 01:34.224
Yeah?

01:38.446 --> 01:39.447
On my way.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.541
[sighs]

01:55.680 --> 01:58.987
[Richard] She'â€™s tachycardic,
up from an hour ago, on Fibral.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.815
Respiration 22 and
pressure is down.

02:00.816 --> 02:01.947
That's why we called.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.124
[Elizabeth] Hello, Lisa. Hello.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.169
My name is Elizabeth Taylor.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.692
I'm the consultant surgeon.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.478
This is my registrar,
Richard Whitehead.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.567
Lisa, do you know where you are?

02:13.568 --> 02:14.917
Can you hear us all right?

02:16.005 --> 02:17.528
Does it hurt when you breathe?

02:18.007 --> 02:20.182
She's had no increase
of pain at McBurney's,

02:20.183 --> 02:21.966
so it doesn't look
like appendix.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.708
But she has had ten milligrams
of morphine since 9:30

02:24.709 --> 02:27.189
and ten megs of Maxolon.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.799
The history?

02:28.800 --> 02:31.933
[Richard] Um, it was one day
of cramping abdominal pain.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.284
Tender abdomen
with guarding at the left iliac.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.373
Was given trimethoprim,
diclofenac and paracetamol,

02:37.374 --> 02:39.070
and then sent away.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.681
Fuck. They sent her home.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.901
[Richard] She came back three
days later in a lot of pain,

02:43.902 --> 02:45.294
elevated pulse.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.819
She was put on IV fluids
and then transferred here.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.038
Decreased urine
output for two days.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.954
Imaging suggests there's
possible bowel involvement,

02:52.955 --> 02:55.913
and notes there is also
an IUCD in the situ.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.177
[screaming]

02:59.004 --> 03:01.484
Okay. Sorry, Lisa.

03:01.485 --> 03:02.617
Sorry, Lisa.

03:04.575 --> 03:07.229
[gasping]

03:07.230 --> 03:08.536
Well?

03:09.145 --> 03:11.277
Uh, clearly
intra-abdominal catastrophe,

03:11.278 --> 03:12.974
so immediate surgery to assess

03:12.975 --> 03:14.889
for perforated
bowel or appendix.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.195
Extensive fluids,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.414
transfer to theatre
for laparoscopy, right?

03:18.415 --> 03:21.243
I agree with immediate
urgent laparoscopy.

03:21.244 --> 03:24.072
Radiology suggests
necrosis of the bowel

03:24.073 --> 03:27.249
and abscess not amenable
to percutaneous drainage.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.251
She needs an operation.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.601
Three units
packed red blood cells,

03:31.602 --> 03:32.733
cross-matched.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.951
Prep for theatre.

03:33.952 --> 03:36.519
Call Dr. Colton to consent her.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.913
Lisa, we'll see you soon.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.914
[ECG monitor beeps]

03:39.915 --> 03:41.263
All right!

03:41.264 --> 03:44.746
We will go in today using
the Hasson technique.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.270
Alex.

03:48.271 --> 03:51.055
[Alex] We are... good to go.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.622
[Elizabeth] Knife.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.320
[Robin] Knife.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.018
[Elizabeth] All right,
we make a ten mil incision

03:57.019 --> 03:59.107
just above the umbilicus,

03:59.108 --> 04:03.590
right through the subcutaneous
tissue into the fascia.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.722
Kocher.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.552
S-Bends.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.162
[Robin] S-Bends.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.990
[Richard] Thank you, Robin.
Holding.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.166
[Elizabeth] Thank you.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.778
Knife.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.911
Now, just a few...

04:20.956 --> 04:22.479
fibres at a time.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.570
And there's the peritoneum.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.486
[Robin] Stitch.

04:32.489 --> 04:33.533
Here you go.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.578
[Elizabeth] Okay.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.196
[Robin] Clip.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.764
- [Elizabeth] Ready?
- [Robin] Cut.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.071
[Richard] This one's out.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.333
Thank you, Robin.

04:51.334 --> 04:54.728
[Elizabeth] Thank you.
Now, we use traction.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.207
Why?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.862
[Richard] To avoid damaging
the underlying structures

04:58.863 --> 05:01.125
when we penetrate the peritoneal
sheath into the abdomen.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.693
[Elizabeth] Good, Richard.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.915
- All right. Port, please, Robin.
- [Robin] Port.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.047
[Elizabeth] All right,
we'll be inserting

05:10.048 --> 05:11.614
three trocars into Lisa today.

05:11.615 --> 05:12.660
Here we go.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.405
[Richard] Uh, reducer.
Please, Robin.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.626
[Elizabeth] Give her
the gas port there, Richard.

05:23.627 --> 05:24.933
Thank you.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.717
[ECG monitor beeping continues]

05:27.718 --> 05:28.980
[Richard] That's set up.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.330
- [Robin] Gas on.
- [Richard] Thank you.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.722
[Elizabeth] All right, maestro.

05:32.723 --> 05:33.897
[Mei-Lynn] Yes?

05:33.898 --> 05:35.290
[Elizabeth] Gas, please.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.509
[Mei-Lynn] Gas is on.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.814
Light is on.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.251
[Elizabeth] There it comes.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.776
[air blowing]

05:44.996 --> 05:46.955
There we are, Richard.
You guide it.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.653
There we go.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.134
Marsh?

05:53.701 --> 05:55.745
[foreboding music plays]

05:55.746 --> 05:57.138
Hmm.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.227
[Richard] Well...
uh, it's extensive pus.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.491
[Elizabeth] Indeed.
Sepsis it is.

06:02.449 --> 06:05.365
All right, I'm inserting
the second trocar now.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.456
Yeah, that's good.
Thank you, Richard.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.416
Hold it right there, I need
direct visualization, please.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.418
Put it back in a little bit.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.115
There...

06:18.116 --> 06:19.161
Okay.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.515
Thank you.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.604
All right, what's going
on with the gas?

06:28.605 --> 06:30.127
[Mei-Lynn]
How much pressure?

06:30.128 --> 06:31.346
[Elizabeth]
I need ten.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.566
We need more flow,

06:33.044 --> 06:34.567
more separation of the organs.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.177
[Mei-Lynn]
Flow rate is at six.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.439
But we're not at ten yet.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.006
[Robin]
The tank was full.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.530
[Elizabeth] Mei-Lynn, can you
increase the flow, please?

06:41.531 --> 06:43.097
[Mei-Lynn] Copy that.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.752
[Elizabeth] Richard, do you want
to put in the last trocar?

06:45.753 --> 06:47.275
[Richard] Yeah.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.363
Thank you, Robin.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.105
[Elizabeth]
Let's find you a spot.

06:51.802 --> 06:52.889
Here we are.

06:52.890 --> 06:53.935
[Richard]
Thank you.

07:03.248 --> 07:05.206
[Elizabeth] Honey, you've got
plenty of room Richard,

07:05.207 --> 07:06.817
you've got plenty of room.

07:07.949 --> 07:08.950
You can see?

07:10.125 --> 07:11.126
[Richard]
Yeah.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.435
[Elizabeth] All right, Richard.
Time's ticking. Let's go.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.088
[ECG monitor beeping increases]

07:18.089 --> 07:20.178
[Elizabeth] Let's go.
Give it some welly.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.528
[Richard]
Sorry.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.488
[tense music]

07:26.489 --> 07:28.925
[Elizabeth] Fuck!
Quick, we need to open.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.145
- We're converting.
- [Robin] We're converting.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.712
[Elizabeth]
I need the B tray

07:32.713 --> 07:33.843
and arterial
instruments, please.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.018
[Robin]
B tray, please.

07:35.019 --> 07:35.758
[Elizabeth] Pull
the trocars out, Richard.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.194
[Richard]
Sorry.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.848
[Elizabeth] Someone call
Mei-Lynn back in right now.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.284
- [Robin] Someone call Mei-Lynn!
- [Elizabeth] B tray, please!

07:40.285 --> 07:41.764
[Elizabeth]
Alex, talk to me.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.853
[Alex] Systolic 90.
Pressure is falling now.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.464
[Elizabeth] Of course
it's fucking falling.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.988
[Elizabeth] I need the B tray!

07:47.989 --> 07:49.511
[Robin]
B, B, quick, quick, quick!

07:49.512 --> 07:51.295
[Elizabeth]
Calm, calm.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.383
Please, everybody, quiet.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.994
- [Mei-Lynn]
Diathermy?

07:53.995 --> 07:56.823
- [Elizabeth] Uh, no. I don't
have time. I'll do it myself.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.520
Richard, hold that.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.565
Alex?

07:59.566 --> 08:01.915
[Alex]
Heart rate is 160.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.482
Pushing midribonol now.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.744
[Elizabeth]
Hold that, Richard.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.833
Here we go. All right.
I'm going in, Alex.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.662
[ECG monitor beeping rapidly]

08:10.751 --> 08:12.186
- Fuck!
- Suction.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.404
[Robin]
Suction.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.668
Retractors.
I'll hold it. Retractors.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.800
- [Richard] Yeah, we need...
- [Elizabeth] Nice, Robin.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.498
- [Elizabeth] Good. You got it?
- [Robin] I got this.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.542
[Elizabeth] Get the big one.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.936
Pull it, Richard. Pull it.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.372
- [Richard]
[indistinct]

08:24.373 --> 08:25.982
- [Robin] Yeah, Richard.
- [Elizabeth] I got it. I got it.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.464
- [Elizabeth] Packs.
- [Robin] Packs.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.515
[sighs wearily]

08:39.083 --> 08:40.563
- Careful with the ureter.
- [Richard] Mm-hmm.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.044
[Elizabeth] Suction--
I can't find it.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.741
Find it.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.917
It's not the IVC,

08:47.918 --> 08:49.440
it's the lumbar artery.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.226
Put your finger on it.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.748
Pressure.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.271
- [Richard] Sorry.
- [Elizabeth] Feel it?

08:54.272 --> 08:55.490
[Elizabeth] Right there.
It's pumping.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.883
- Feel it?
- [Richard] Mm.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.059
[Elizabeth] Keep your
finger on it. Clamp.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.365
[Alex] Thank you.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.067
[Elizabeth]
Got it? Okay.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.722
One more here.
One more here.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.376
Stitches.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.769
Five-0, please.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.119
[Robin] Stitch.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.666
[cutting]

09:40.928 --> 09:41.929
[Elizabeth]
Okay.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.105
The torrential bleeding
from the vena cava

09:45.106 --> 09:46.586
is controlled with clamps...

09:47.630 --> 09:50.110
[sighs] ...and we move
in order of urgency.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.068
Richard has control

09:52.069 --> 09:54.332
of the posterior
tear with his finger.

09:55.246 --> 09:58.684
The most urgent
is the lumbar vessel

09:58.685 --> 10:00.468
due to the volume of bleeding,

10:00.469 --> 10:03.515
and I am focused
on that right now.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.304
There's a rent in the IVC...

10:12.089 --> 10:13.395
which is clamped,

10:14.570 --> 10:17.442
and severe lumbar
bleeding in the psoas,

10:18.705 --> 10:21.663
which is posterior...

10:21.664 --> 10:23.971
and deep.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.104
Currently sewing
five-0 prolene.

10:33.589 --> 10:34.937
[Alex]
Looking much better now.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.201
- [Elizabeth] Okay.
- [Alex] Pressure is coming up.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.682
[Elizabeth] Now
for the original operation.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.554
Let's wash out this pelvis,
pop in a drain,

10:43.555 --> 10:45.470
take out the appendix
for good measure.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.820
[Richard]
Yeah. Okay.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.778
Uh, I'm-- Elizabeth, I'm sorry.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.303
[Elizabeth]
Hey, just close.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.310
- [Robin] Josie.
- I need you on this retractor.

10:59.963 --> 11:00.964
[Robin]
Yeah.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.576
[Richard]
Okay, uh...

11:05.708 --> 11:06.666
Okay, splash me.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.104
- [Robin] Thank you.
- I'll take suction. Thank you.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.673
Fuck.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.588
- [Richard] Yeah, well--
- [Robin] Suction.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.116
[Richard]
Uh, yes, let me.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.378
Thank you, that's it.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.727
[Robin]
Suction.

11:25.728 --> 11:29.776
[sombre music]

11:39.829 --> 11:41.569
[door opening]

11:41.570 --> 11:43.484
[Elizabeth] Unfortunately,
I've got to reschedule

11:43.485 --> 11:44.921
my next surgery.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.274
Go tell Lisa's
parents it went well.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.667
Uh, don't you want--

11:52.668 --> 11:53.755
[Elizabeth]
She's out of the woods.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.191
But surely you could explain--

11:55.192 --> 11:57.628
[Elizabeth] Richard,
it went well.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.326
She's in recovery.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.068
They can talk to her in ICU.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.593
You're good with families.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.682
Thank you, Richard.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.124
[breathes shakily]

12:19.086 --> 12:20.869
[Richard] Um,
Mr. and Mrs. Williams,

12:20.870 --> 12:23.567
I am Richard Whitehead,
the registrar.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.439
I'm with Mrs. Taylor.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.571
Lisa's doing well.
She's in recovery now.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.705
I just want to apologize
about the delay.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.709
[distant sirens blaring]

12:38.279 --> 12:39.323
[sighs]

12:58.516 --> 13:01.258
[strained breathing]

13:04.435 --> 13:06.175
[machine beeps]

13:06.176 --> 13:07.960
[Jan] Just nice,
deep breaths, Lisa.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.137
Just easy breaths.
Yeah.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.226
That's it.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.015
How's she doing?

13:19.668 --> 13:20.929
Uh, she's stable.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.150
A bit agitated about the mask.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.857
[Elizabeth]
Hi, Lisa.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.832
It went well.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.009
[foreboding music]

13:59.012 --> 14:00.317
[breathing raggedly]

14:17.944 --> 14:20.903
[foreboding music continues]

14:24.167 --> 14:25.647
[register beeps]

14:43.970 --> 14:46.146
[sombre music]

14:49.149 --> 14:50.498
[door creaks shut]

14:52.021 --> 14:54.545
[Elizabeth] Robin,
did you get a taxi?

14:56.417 --> 14:57.809
Uh, yeah.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.333
Clear night.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.856
[Robin]
Um, yeah. It is.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.292
It's beautiful.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.252
- Want some chicken?
- [scoffs]

15:08.472 --> 15:10.386
Got a double shift tomorrow.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.649
- That's shit.
- [Robin] Mm.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.478
- I'll talk to Alastair--
- [Robin] Mm-mm.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.958
Please don't.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.960
You can't do things like that.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.180
It might ruin things.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.273
You good?

15:30.190 --> 15:31.973
Yeah.

15:31.974 --> 15:32.975
Yup.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.547
[both giggling]

15:52.038 --> 15:54.257
[seagulls squawking]

16:05.399 --> 16:08.271
[water rushing]

16:16.976 --> 16:18.673
[phone vibrates]

16:23.069 --> 16:24.505
[muted gasp]

16:26.289 --> 16:27.725
Fuck!

16:53.925 --> 16:54.969
[Elizabeth]
All good?

16:54.970 --> 16:57.015
Yeah, of course.
Uh, five by three.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.278
Walk beside me, Richard.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.195
How are you doing?

17:03.196 --> 17:04.805
[Richard]
I'm all right.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.590
Good. How did you hear?

17:07.591 --> 17:08.636
[Richard]
Hear what?

17:09.811 --> 17:10.986
[sighs]

17:13.728 --> 17:16.164
Richard, we lost
the sepsis this morning.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.124
I was texted on the way in.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.040
She-- What?
So she was what, in the ICU?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.390
[Elizabeth]
Yes, in ICU.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.869
[Richard]
Ah, I didn't know.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.132
Yes, it's a bad outcome.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.482
It's very disappointing.

17:29.918 --> 17:30.918
Okay?

17:30.919 --> 17:32.094
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.749
The sepsis was too advanced,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.448
and she was likely
never going to make it.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.540
The trocar... did that--
Was that--

17:44.541 --> 17:46.413
This was advanced sepsis,
wasn't it?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.153
You saw that yourself.

17:48.154 --> 17:51.765
So we'll never know
to what degree if any,

17:51.766 --> 17:53.897
the extra time
in surgery contributed.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.508
Yeah... I suppose
the complication--

17:55.509 --> 17:56.857
The complication
may have contributed,

17:56.858 --> 17:58.119
but we'll never know how much.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.164
Right?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.080
So certainly didn't help.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.952
Look, all we can do
now is move on.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.606
Get past it. Get better.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.651
Learn.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.264
Morning, Liz.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.483
Good morning, Alastair.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.920
Have you seen the staff
photo on the website?

18:16.921 --> 18:19.401
Yes. It looked like
a group of prisoners

18:19.402 --> 18:21.099
about to be taken out and shot.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.144
[Alastair] Ah.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.494
Well, maybe
it was the black and white.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.366
What can I do for you, Alastair?

18:27.193 --> 18:29.019
Can we have a quick word?

18:29.020 --> 18:30.673
Of course.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.979
I'll catch up.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.112
- Yeah, okay.
- [Alastair] Thanks, Richard.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.114
[Richard]
No worries.

18:36.289 --> 18:37.332
I'm sorry.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.987
Um, hi, David isn't it?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.120
- [David] Yes.
- [Richard] Great, I've got--

18:42.164 --> 18:43.425
Anyway, Alastair?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.601
[Alastair] Liz,
the family of Lisa Williams,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.908
who died this morning,
are asking to see you.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.127
They're here now.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.345
Oh.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.218
I should warn you,
they're very distraught.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.221
They were under the impression
that when she was admitted,

18:56.222 --> 18:57.570
yes, it was an emergency,

18:57.571 --> 19:00.790
but an appendix
or something like that.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.836
They feel very caught off guard,

19:02.837 --> 19:04.751
and they say
they're very unsatisfied

19:04.752 --> 19:06.927
with the explanation from ICU.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.537
Who spoke to them from ICU?

19:08.538 --> 19:09.712
Ben Matthews.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.237
Ben was the intensivist.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.500
[sighs]
Andrew.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.242
Elizabeth, how are you?

19:17.373 --> 19:19.375
Well, I'm happy
to speak with them.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.553
And what are you going to say?

19:24.554 --> 19:27.034
I'm going to tell them
what happened in surgery.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.644
I wasn't there in ICU.

19:28.645 --> 19:29.994
Okay.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
What really happened, Liz?

19:34.651 --> 19:36.523
Well, you've obviously
read the notes.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.309
Uncontrolled
insertion of a trocar

19:41.310 --> 19:43.268
leading to internal damage--

19:43.269 --> 19:46.227
...Which was unrelated
to the galloping infection

19:46.228 --> 19:49.057
that led to her fatal
deterioration in ICU.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.537
"Unrelated"?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.234
Yes, that's what I said.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.757
Okay...

19:54.758 --> 19:56.063
But you know what
you're going to say.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.195
You've got it in hand.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.239
[Elizabeth] I think
well in hand.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.589
- Okay.
- Thank you, Andrew.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.895
Actually, I just
wanted to ask you

20:01.896 --> 20:03.244
if you're coming
to the conference,

20:03.245 --> 20:05.899
the Surgical Safety
and Measurements Jamboree?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.815
Yes, Andrew. I will take
that one for the team.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.296
Actually, I want the whole team
to be there. Richard, Robin.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.471
I think it's important.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.821
It's... It's quite interesting.

20:14.822 --> 20:16.039
[Elizabeth]
Interesting?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.476
Well... it is about
publishing results.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.521
That's our new reality.

20:19.522 --> 20:23.221
Our surgical results are going
to be published in the paper.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.963
Mortality, complications.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.444
<i>My</i> results, you mean.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.187
True, your results.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.058
Everything under your watch.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.278
But I don't think it's, uh...

20:37.279 --> 20:39.280
I don't think
it's necessarily a bad idea.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.152
It will incentivize us to
avoid very sick patients

20:42.153 --> 20:43.590
and it will affect training.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.854
Liz, the family are waiting
in the Whanau room.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.421
Thank you.

20:49.422 --> 20:50.683
Andrew.

20:50.684 --> 20:51.728
Elizabeth.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.168
[tense music]

21:18.581 --> 21:22.193
[sad music]

21:48.176 --> 21:50.091
I'm so sorry for your loss.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.443
Well...

21:55.575 --> 21:58.360
This is what happened to Lisa.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.625
Lisa was very sick
when she came to hospital.

22:05.062 --> 22:08.805
Some of her reproductive
organs had become infected.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.939
We believe this was
because of her IUCD.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.899
That stands for "Intrauterine
Contraceptive Device."

22:18.554 --> 22:20.163
Uh...

22:20.164 --> 22:24.559
We needed to do what
is called a "laparoscopy."

22:24.560 --> 22:26.996
That's a kind of keyhole surgery

22:26.997 --> 22:29.085
where we make a small hole

22:29.086 --> 22:32.045
and... and use a small
camera to look inside Lisa

22:32.046 --> 22:36.136
and see... um...
what's wrong with her.

22:36.137 --> 22:39.052
And we could see
that she was very sick,

22:39.053 --> 22:41.620
that many of her abdominal
organs had become infected,

22:41.621 --> 22:45.667
and that she needed a...

22:45.668 --> 22:48.714
a proper operation to
help her get better.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.631
And I can give you the details
of that if you'd like.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.381
I mean, we just don't
know what happened.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.297
We... We want to know more.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.996
[sobbing]

23:17.091 --> 23:18.788
Uh...

23:20.355 --> 23:22.965
There was a complication
during the surgery.

23:22.966 --> 23:27.536
We had to make a larger
incision than initially planned.

23:28.537 --> 23:29.930
What complication?

23:31.061 --> 23:34.021
[Elizabeth] As I said,
her IUCD had become infected.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.589
And, um, we don't
know why at this point.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.418
But there are many
reasons it could have happened.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.334
Lisa was moved to intensive
care after the surgery,

23:44.335 --> 23:46.946
and I was not directly
involved in that.

23:46.947 --> 23:49.079
We just thought,
"Oh, it's her..."

23:50.733 --> 23:53.387
We just thought
her appendix had burst,

23:53.388 --> 23:55.998
which is why it was so bad.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.348
[Elizabeth]
I'm sorry.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.742
I know this must be very hard,

24:00.743 --> 24:03.310
but it was not to do
with her appendix.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.139
Lisa had trouble
breathing in ICU.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.968
The infection was
too much for her body,

24:08.969 --> 24:12.146
and this led to
her cardiac arrest.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.369
She's in the morgue.

24:20.067 --> 24:23.723
[angrily] Our daughter
is in the morgue.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.473
Wh... What's your name?

24:38.738 --> 24:41.741
Elizabeth Taylor is my name.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.363
[camera clicks]

25:00.237 --> 25:01.630
[sighs wearily]

25:04.415 --> 25:06.940
[sombre music]

25:50.636 --> 25:52.725
[siren blaring in distance]

25:56.816 --> 25:58.294
[Andrew]
<i>Welcome, everybody,</i>

25:58.295 --> 26:02.342
<i>to this week's M&M.</i>

26:02.343 --> 26:06.086
<i>So we'll start with
the Lisa Williams case.</i>

26:06.869 --> 26:12.831
Anaesthesia, nursing,
as well as surgery.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.311
Glad to see you.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.705
Uh, excuse me.
Where's Dr. Matthews?

26:17.706 --> 26:19.707
Well, Dr. Matthews
is an apology.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.404
Dr. Matthews
was the intensivist

26:21.405 --> 26:22.841
on Lisa Williams,

26:22.842 --> 26:24.625
- the main case today.
- Well...

26:24.626 --> 26:27.976
I'd like to call for this
meeting to be adjourned.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.804
[Andrew]
Oh... Why, Liz?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.633
Without Dr. Matthews,
what's the point?

26:32.634 --> 26:33.852
Well, the point is that

26:33.853 --> 26:36.419
this is a morbidity
and mortality meeting,

26:36.420 --> 26:39.597
and in it, we're going to
be discussing in particular

26:39.598 --> 26:41.207
surgery and mortality.

26:41.208 --> 26:44.210
The mortality in this case is
not related to the surgery.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.516
It's related to her
advanced sepsis,

26:46.517 --> 26:49.258
and the nearly 12 hours
of intensive care

26:49.259 --> 26:51.391
that failed to save
her afterwards.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.958
No, this is just an M&M.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.787
We're not apportioning blame.

26:55.439 --> 26:56.483
Um... Blame?

26:56.484 --> 26:57.789
No--

26:57.790 --> 26:59.791
I want to know what happened.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.706
Family want more information.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.968
What information?

27:02.969 --> 27:04.665
I've spoken to them already.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.841
Well, let's just say
their acceptance

27:06.842 --> 27:09.365
of their daughter's death
is not yet settled.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.630
Okay, this is so fucking stupid.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.981
Why would that be stupid, Liz?

27:15.982 --> 27:18.637
[Elizabeth] It's stupid,
Andrew, because...

27:20.726 --> 27:22.204
We can go through our notes,

27:22.205 --> 27:24.424
you can talk to my team
till you're blue in the face.

27:24.425 --> 27:28.471
But we can't possibly know
what happened with this girl

27:28.472 --> 27:30.343
without ICU
and their nurses here,

27:30.344 --> 27:31.910
because they took over her care

27:31.911 --> 27:34.521
and she <i>died</i> on their watch.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.089
[Andrew] Lisa Williams' parents
have questions about errors

27:37.090 --> 27:40.135
made by the surgical staff,
not ICU.

27:40.136 --> 27:43.661
They want to know about
complications in the surgery,

27:43.662 --> 27:47.403
your surgery,
because you told them

27:47.404 --> 27:51.191
there were complications
for Liz... apparently.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.455
[chuckles]
I mean, for Lisa.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.763
Am I right?

27:58.589 --> 27:59.938
[inhales sharply]

27:59.939 --> 28:02.114
Or...

28:02.115 --> 28:03.594
am I being stupid?

28:05.771 --> 28:08.686
Right.
Let me just summarize.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.298
- Anaesthesia started at 1:40.
- Yes, it did.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.953
- And the surgery at 1:50.
- Correct.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.737
And the gas port was inserted

28:16.738 --> 28:21.047
into the abdomen and,
uh, insufflation commenced.

28:21.656 --> 28:22.657
Robin?

28:24.311 --> 28:26.138
Yes. Yes, that is correct.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.270
And you say here in your notes

28:28.271 --> 28:32.100
that Mrs. Taylor verbalized
that there was no gas.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.536
Insufficient gas.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.060
I-I said in my notes

28:35.061 --> 28:39.586
that, um, Mrs. Taylor said
there was insufficient gas flow.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.023
What did she mean?

28:43.286 --> 28:44.896
What...

28:44.897 --> 28:47.768
She meant there's insufficient
pressure of gas in the abdomen

28:47.769 --> 28:49.727
that lifts the peritoneal sac

28:49.728 --> 28:51.685
away from internal structures

28:51.686 --> 28:54.906
that could be damaged
by insertion of instruments.

28:54.907 --> 28:57.430
And what was the pressure
at that point?

28:57.431 --> 28:59.258
How much gas was in her abdomen?

28:59.259 --> 29:01.086
I mean, frankly speaking,

29:01.087 --> 29:03.045
was it safe to go
sticking things in her?

29:03.959 --> 29:05.525
Well, I don't know, Doctor.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.048
Ah! You don't know?

29:07.049 --> 29:08.746
[Alex]
She can't know!

29:08.747 --> 29:11.792
The indicator on the insufflator
reads "enough" or "not enough."

29:11.793 --> 29:13.968
When the belly is inflated,
the gas slows down

29:13.969 --> 29:15.883
as the pressure
doesn't let it in there.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.973
The theoretical pressure needed
inside the cavity is ten, sure,

29:18.974 --> 29:22.150
but there's no actual
gauge that measures that.

29:22.151 --> 29:25.632
It just says the flow rate
is or is not high enough

29:25.633 --> 29:27.068
to inflate at that level.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.635
- [Andrew] Okay.
- Okay or not.

29:28.636 --> 29:31.464
We had direct visualization
of the organ space.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.682
[Andrew] Okay.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.815
And at whatever
actual pressure it was,

29:34.816 --> 29:36.817
in my clinical judgment,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.166
there was sufficient pressure--

29:38.167 --> 29:40.125
To insert the last trocar?

29:40.126 --> 29:41.430
Yes, Jason.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.172
Jesus, Jason.
There's no definitive timing.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.131
That's what you do.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.960
You use your clinical judgment.

29:49.091 --> 29:52.006
So, who inserted
the last trocar, Liz?

29:52.007 --> 29:54.314
Who put it... the trocar in?

29:58.231 --> 29:59.232
Uh...

30:01.408 --> 30:02.843
I did.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.715
[Andrew] You inserted
the last trocar

30:05.716 --> 30:08.153
that caused
the damage to this girl,

30:08.154 --> 30:11.243
which was a rent in
the inferior vena cava,

30:11.244 --> 30:13.506
cut in the posterior
abdominal wall,

30:13.507 --> 30:14.855
a tear in the lumbar artery--

30:14.856 --> 30:18.772
Yes, yes, which we repaired,
of course.

30:18.773 --> 30:19.947
[Andrew]
Okay, good.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.645
Good. Yes.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.345
Okay.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.871
[sighs] Look, it was more
complicated than that.

30:30.872 --> 30:35.267
I instructed my registrar,
Richard Whitehead,

30:35.268 --> 30:38.879
to make the incision
and insert the last trocar,

30:38.880 --> 30:40.272
and he did.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.188
Oh, so <i>Richard</i> inserted
the last trocar.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.667
I'm the team leader.

30:44.668 --> 30:45.931
I'm the lead surgeon.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.323
It's my theatre.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.803
Under my instruction,

30:49.804 --> 30:52.198
Richard inserted
the last trocar,

30:53.721 --> 30:55.375
which failed to penetrate.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.986
I told him to push harder.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.727
[Andrew]
Told Richard...

31:00.728 --> 31:03.122
I said to give it some welly.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.081
"Welly."

31:12.653 --> 31:13.654
That's right.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.968
[sombre music]

31:27.929 --> 31:31.932
Would you look at
this gorgeous creature?

31:31.933 --> 31:33.326
[Elizabeth]
You're a dog mother.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.372
[Jessica] Have you ever seen
anything so photogenic?

31:37.373 --> 31:39.853
- He's like your child.
- [Jessica] Mmm.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.290
He's great company.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.336
What's new?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.946
[Jessica clears throat]

31:45.947 --> 31:47.817
You know, it's...

31:47.818 --> 31:49.733
It's complicated.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.387
I met a really smart guy.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.695
[sighs] And your marriage?

31:55.696 --> 31:56.958
[Jessica] It's over.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.440
- Yeah.
- [Elizabeth] I'm sorry.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.008
Yeah, I know.
It's shit, really.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.885
[sighs] I had a shit week too.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.539
Yeah.

32:13.540 --> 32:14.888
[Elizabeth]
Complicated, as you say.

32:14.889 --> 32:15.934
Mm.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.156
Um...

32:22.157 --> 32:24.985
So I really hate to ask, Liz,

32:24.986 --> 32:26.987
but is there any
way that Atticus

32:26.988 --> 32:28.729
could stay with you
for a little while?

32:30.383 --> 32:32.036
- The dog?
- [Jessica] Yeah.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.559
[Jessica] It's just
because I'm...

32:33.560 --> 32:35.387
I'm moving into his apartment,

32:35.388 --> 32:38.781
and-and you know,
it's no good for a big dog.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.783
There's elevators and stuff.

32:40.784 --> 32:45.484
And Stephen won't take him
because he's punishing me, so...

32:45.485 --> 32:47.269
But it would just
be for a short term.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.010
Jess, no. I really don't--

32:50.011 --> 32:51.533
I really don't think I can.

32:51.534 --> 32:53.535
Atticus is so old, Liz.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.189
He's totally house trained.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.105
All he does is just lie around
in the sun all day and sleep,

32:58.106 --> 32:59.193
and he'll be your best buddy.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.325
I am never home.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.674
Oh, God. Fuck.
Don't worry about it.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.982
We're never home either.
He's totally used to it.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.516
Robin, where are you?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.127
I want you to come over.

33:20.476 --> 33:21.869
Do you want to?

33:23.305 --> 33:24.437
Um.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.701
Hey, I'm sorry I've been
so distracted by everything,

33:28.702 --> 33:31.009
you know,
all the shitty fucking shit.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.752
Jessica is making
me take her dog.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.450
[laughs]

33:38.451 --> 33:39.756
<i>It's such...</i>

33:40.583 --> 33:42.020
Uh... Okay.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.240
Bye for now.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.329
Call me.

34:40.078 --> 34:44.038
[uneasy music]

35:01.664 --> 35:03.666
[distant crackling]

35:27.864 --> 35:29.431
[sombre music]

35:39.528 --> 35:40.790
[Atticus barks]

36:08.601 --> 36:10.341
[Te] You have been
invisible to your patients

36:10.342 --> 36:13.257
and your performance levels
have been equally invisible

36:13.258 --> 36:14.693
until now,

36:14.694 --> 36:16.477
because we are
going to be publishing

36:16.478 --> 36:18.740
surgical outcomes publicly.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.656
This, of course, raises
profound questions,

36:21.353 --> 36:23.963
because once publication starts,

36:23.964 --> 36:27.009
patients and potential patients

36:27.010 --> 36:29.535
will assess your track records
and compare you to others.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.711
Of course, they won't know
that the surgeon down the road,

36:32.712 --> 36:34.843
who has much better statistics,

36:34.844 --> 36:36.584
only qualified six months ago,

36:36.585 --> 36:40.240
and has operated on
a grand total of seven young,

36:40.241 --> 36:41.981
non-smoking white patients,

36:41.982 --> 36:44.940
whilst you have
been in the trenches,

36:44.941 --> 36:48.640
operating on the morbidly obese,
the diabetic,

36:48.641 --> 36:51.077
elderly brown folk
with histories of falls

36:51.078 --> 36:53.122
and gout
and respiratory disease.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.690
You will be compared
surgeon to surgeon,

36:55.691 --> 36:58.258
and every case of everyone
who has ever died

36:58.259 --> 36:59.564
underneath your scalpel

36:59.565 --> 37:01.653
will be on full public display.

37:01.654 --> 37:05.223
Every surgical site,
infection, every nicked aorta.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.616
Will some surgeons
be forced to retire?

37:08.617 --> 37:10.139
Maybe.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.532
Probably.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.708
Will some surgeons
be treated unfairly?

37:13.709 --> 37:15.275
Yes, most likely.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.798
Why, then,
should we allow this,

37:16.799 --> 37:17.974
even encourage it?

37:18.888 --> 37:21.586
Transparency
and informed consent.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.544
And I'm talking about
real consent,

37:23.545 --> 37:26.417
not just a scribble
on a piece of paper

37:26.418 --> 37:27.940
moments before operating.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.463
In the broader context,
a surgeon--

37:29.464 --> 37:31.160
Sorry. I'm sorry.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.249
Yes?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.815
Liz Taylor.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.209
Yes, Mrs. Taylor?

37:36.210 --> 37:38.256
This will turn
surgery upside down.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.169
It is inevitable

37:40.170 --> 37:42.911
that good surgeons
will be treated unfairly.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.392
You just said so yourself.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.394
And it sounds like
you accept this.

37:47.395 --> 37:49.875
Well, isn't being
transparent about your results

37:49.876 --> 37:52.138
what a good surgeon does,

37:52.139 --> 37:54.445
so that your patients are
able to give informed consent?

37:54.446 --> 37:56.447
Okay, look,
sorry if I'm-- [chuckles]

37:56.448 --> 37:58.231
Maybe I'm coming off
like a tendentious bitch...

37:58.232 --> 38:00.278
- [chuckles]
- but this is important to us.

38:00.974 --> 38:03.802
Publishing results
is a bad idea.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.153
We will avoid
very sick patients.

38:07.241 --> 38:10.112
Why risk adding someone who
will likely die to my numbers?

38:10.113 --> 38:11.680
Why should I take that risk?

38:12.377 --> 38:14.291
Changes everything.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.815
Which surgeon will
give their registrar a go,

38:16.816 --> 38:18.382
if when it all
turns to shambles,

38:18.383 --> 38:19.992
it goes on their record?

38:19.993 --> 38:21.299
[Andrew] Liz.

38:22.561 --> 38:25.606
That's... That's a good point.

38:25.607 --> 38:26.912
Lots of good points.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.871
But what we're talking
about here is resources.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.308
No! We're talking about numbers.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.440
- Well--
- I'm talking about numbers.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.443
We're talking about
ranking people

38:36.444 --> 38:39.272
best to worst in league tables

38:39.273 --> 38:43.190
using data that is
insufficient and partial.

38:43.886 --> 38:46.367
And surgeons will
be hung out to dry.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.240
[Te] Whoa!

38:51.241 --> 38:52.981
It appears we have entered

38:52.982 --> 38:55.810
the Q&A portion of our session

38:55.811 --> 38:57.464
- slightly ahead of time.
- [chuckles]

38:57.465 --> 38:59.640
I just don't think
we can be idiots about this,

38:59.641 --> 39:02.077
and do it just because
other countries do.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.994
How many cardiac surgeons
can we afford to lose?

39:06.256 --> 39:07.301
Do you know how many we've got?

39:07.997 --> 39:09.999
- Twenty-nine! It's not enough.
- Liz.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.219
Thank you.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.395
Twenty-nine.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.005
And according to him,

39:17.006 --> 39:18.398
half are going to
have to retire soon.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.009
[Andrew] Yeah, okay.
That's a good point.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.271
But let's...

39:22.272 --> 39:23.317
Doctor.

39:24.274 --> 39:27.147
[sombre music]

40:09.232 --> 40:13.454
[sombre music continues]

40:43.136 --> 40:45.354
Very gripping stuff.

40:45.355 --> 40:46.443
[Elizabeth] Wasn't it.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.620
Interesting, provocative.

40:49.185 --> 40:50.447
People will be crucified.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.145
[Andrew] Yeah, some surgeons
need to reassess.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.625
You're not worried
about your data.

40:54.626 --> 40:56.497
The other specialties
are nervous.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.455
We're years behind
the world on this,

40:58.456 --> 40:59.892
and it's not thought through.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.546
You're not nervous, eh?

41:02.547 --> 41:04.157
'Cause you're brilliant.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.246
You're absolutely brilliant.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.901
But, um...

41:09.989 --> 41:12.817
Elizabeth, unfortunately,
it falls to my lot

41:12.818 --> 41:14.949
to tell you that
there's been a...

41:14.950 --> 41:16.604
formal complaint.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.345
[Elizabeth]
A complaint?

41:19.346 --> 41:21.479
Formal complaint.
Lisa's parents.

41:24.569 --> 41:26.571
When were you going
to tell me about this?

41:28.007 --> 41:29.922
Well, I'm telling you now.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.060
Piece of shit.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.848
[dramatic music]

41:47.069 --> 41:48.070
Hey.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.246
Hi.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.292
Leave you to it.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.470
I called you last night.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.081
Yeah.

42:00.822 --> 42:02.954
I can feel you disappearing.

42:02.955 --> 42:05.523
Yeah, I just want to
get the fuck out of here.

42:08.047 --> 42:11.005
So, what did Andrew want?

42:11.006 --> 42:12.790
Saw he cornered you.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.880
[Elizabeth] Apparently,
there's been a complaint

42:15.881 --> 42:17.186
about the surgery.

42:18.187 --> 42:20.580
Like a...
Like a formal complaint?

42:20.581 --> 42:22.496
I haven't read it.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.672
Haven't seen it
in writing, but yes.

42:25.673 --> 42:28.370
And, um, he wanted
to rub it in my face.

42:28.371 --> 42:29.503
Well, that's shit.

42:30.417 --> 42:31.635
Well.

42:31.636 --> 42:32.680
Yeah.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.813
Can't handle you.

42:35.683 --> 42:39.208
[club music playing]

42:48.914 --> 42:50.002
Did you...

42:51.525 --> 42:54.093
Did you know Richard left
when you were speaking?

42:55.442 --> 42:56.573
Richard?

42:56.574 --> 42:57.575
Yeah.

42:58.488 --> 42:59.489
No.

43:01.622 --> 43:03.623
He was pretty upset.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.844
Richard is a sensitive type.

43:06.845 --> 43:09.281
He needs to learn
to love the hook.

43:09.282 --> 43:10.630
Well, uh...

43:10.631 --> 43:12.023
I don't blame him, Liz.

43:12.024 --> 43:13.242
It was... It was pretty public.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.635
What's public?

43:15.636 --> 43:17.769
The things you say out loud...

43:19.814 --> 43:21.816
Registrars in shambles.

43:22.338 --> 43:23.862
[chuckles]

43:25.515 --> 43:27.039
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.824
What's wrong with people?

43:48.190 --> 43:50.758
[dark music]

44:01.813 --> 44:04.467
[sombre music]

44:47.815 --> 44:48.816
[sighs]

44:50.862 --> 44:52.733
[indistinct conversation]

45:00.741 --> 45:01.872
Andrew.

45:01.873 --> 45:02.917
Seen this?

45:13.406 --> 45:14.886
[gasps]

45:21.066 --> 45:22.067
Fuck!

45:23.721 --> 45:26.114
[bird chirping]

45:35.080 --> 45:36.516
[sharp breath] Unbelievable.

45:43.131 --> 45:44.305
[sighing]

45:44.306 --> 45:45.568
[phone vibrates]

46:03.499 --> 46:04.499
[Richard] Hey.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.588
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

46:06.589 --> 46:08.940
[Elizabeth] Oh, no,
you're not interrupting.

46:13.074 --> 46:14.901
What can I do for you, Richard?

46:14.902 --> 46:17.730
[Richard] I, uh...
I think it's ridiculous.

46:17.731 --> 46:20.081
That's ridiculous and wrong.

46:20.821 --> 46:22.039
You'll be all right.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.432
Just keep your head
down and work.

46:24.433 --> 46:26.261
Don't start looking unlucky.

46:27.872 --> 46:29.569
What does your father
say about it?

46:30.135 --> 46:33.528
I haven't told him anything yet.

46:33.529 --> 46:35.748
Isn't that something
you'd talk to him about?

46:35.749 --> 46:37.402
You talk about work, don't you?

46:37.403 --> 46:39.970
But the thing is, like,
he's just been appointed

46:39.971 --> 46:41.799
to the head of surgery
in Dunedin.

46:43.191 --> 46:44.148
Yeah.

46:44.149 --> 46:45.497
I'm just not sure

46:45.498 --> 46:47.586
what position it would
put him in if I told him.

46:47.587 --> 46:49.197
- You know?
- [Elizabeth] Oh?

46:51.156 --> 46:52.157
Yeah.

46:54.942 --> 46:56.770
Not actually sure
what he would say.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.038
He'd probably say
you're better than this.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.953
Probably, but...

47:06.954 --> 47:09.216
What if I'm not, though?

47:09.217 --> 47:11.131
[Elizabeth]
Come on, Richard.

47:11.132 --> 47:12.306
You don't understand.

47:12.307 --> 47:14.787
Look, I have been
having dreams about her.

47:14.788 --> 47:15.833
[Elizabeth]
Richard...

47:17.747 --> 47:20.358
We did everything in our power,

47:20.359 --> 47:22.187
inside and outside theatre.

47:24.319 --> 47:26.147
Mistakes may always happen.

47:28.715 --> 47:30.630
They're scary dreams, Liz.

47:36.201 --> 47:38.289
They're just dreams.

47:38.290 --> 47:40.988
Just dreams.

47:43.948 --> 47:44.949
Yeah.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.131
Maybe you'd be interested in
some confidential counselling

47:54.132 --> 47:55.524
or something like that.

47:56.786 --> 47:58.484
Can I set that up for you?

48:00.355 --> 48:01.704
I...

48:04.055 --> 48:05.316
I want you to know that,

48:05.317 --> 48:08.623
I know what you've done for me.

48:08.624 --> 48:09.930
I did nothing, Richard.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.628
It was my mistake.

48:13.629 --> 48:15.761
I trusted your judgment,
I was wrong.

48:15.762 --> 48:16.936
It's called training.

48:16.937 --> 48:18.199
It has risks.

48:20.071 --> 48:22.159
I took the decision to do it.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.247
[Richard] That was me--

48:23.248 --> 48:24.379
No, I did.

48:25.815 --> 48:26.904
I did.

48:27.905 --> 48:28.906
Me.

48:31.952 --> 48:33.345
Leave it with me.

48:35.434 --> 48:38.349
You can. You can just
leave it with me.

48:38.350 --> 48:40.352
Really, I can take it.

48:41.483 --> 48:42.484
[muted groan]

48:46.271 --> 48:47.924
Why don't you get
something, hmm?

48:47.925 --> 48:49.360
Get something to eat.

48:49.361 --> 48:50.449
Uh...

48:51.145 --> 48:52.842
Uh, no, no.

48:55.323 --> 48:57.977
Okay, well... [clears throat]

48:57.978 --> 48:59.065
[phone vibrates]

48:59.066 --> 49:00.720
I've got to get going.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.113
So...

49:03.114 --> 49:05.898
To be continued? Yeah.

49:05.899 --> 49:07.248
Well, when are we--

49:09.033 --> 49:10.121
When what?

49:11.861 --> 49:13.385
When will it be continued?

49:15.909 --> 49:16.954
Tomorrow sometime.

49:19.304 --> 49:21.784
I told her parents
that she was okay,

49:22.829 --> 49:23.872
that it went well.

49:23.873 --> 49:24.962
You said that.

49:27.442 --> 49:28.704
Yes, I did.

49:30.054 --> 49:31.577
Yes, she was.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.930
Stop telling yourself
a different story.

49:41.587 --> 49:43.415
Jesus!
Fuck, Richard.

49:46.374 --> 49:49.682
[sombre music]

50:36.511 --> 50:37.859
[Alex] Gonna go fishing
this weekend.

50:37.860 --> 50:39.078
You want to come?

50:39.079 --> 50:40.384
- [Elizabeth] Me?
- You'd enjoy it.

50:40.385 --> 50:42.038
I don't fish.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.430
[Alex] Well, you could try.

50:43.431 --> 50:45.519
- [phone rings]
- You could learn.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.868
Everything is always there.

50:46.869 --> 50:49.567
You go away, take a rest,
come back.

50:49.568 --> 50:51.438
Is the patient consented?

50:51.439 --> 50:52.745
Yes.

50:53.441 --> 50:55.486
- It's cancelled.
- What, really?

50:55.487 --> 50:57.141
I don't know, they just told
me it's cancelled.

50:59.491 --> 51:00.927
[sighs]

51:02.059 --> 51:03.060
Fuck!

[indistinct hospital

51:07.629 --> 51:08.629
[knocking]

51:08.630 --> 51:09.804
Oh...

51:09.805 --> 51:11.284
What happened?

51:11.285 --> 51:12.894
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

51:12.895 --> 51:14.244
He, he ate something in
the middle of the night,

51:14.245 --> 51:15.723
forgot about it,

51:15.724 --> 51:17.726
and then remembered
all of a sudden during consent.

51:18.249 --> 51:19.467
Oh.

51:20.033 --> 51:21.512
[soft chuckle] You're going
through a bit

51:21.513 --> 51:23.036
over there, I gather.

51:24.603 --> 51:26.125
It'll blow over.

51:26.126 --> 51:28.041
[Mary] It's a cracked
system, Liz.

51:32.611 --> 51:35.092
Look, how well known
is my complaint?

51:36.745 --> 51:38.921
Well, it's about, can't lie.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.794
But as you say,
it'll blow over.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.013
[sighs]

51:47.452 --> 51:48.975
Did he really eat something?

51:51.456 --> 51:52.631
So I'm told.

51:54.415 --> 51:57.244
Some spag bowl from the fridge
in the middle of the night.

51:58.332 --> 52:00.681
And there's really
nothing else...

52:00.682 --> 52:02.944
Nothing else that I
can use you for today.

52:02.945 --> 52:05.644
So, um,
I'm sorry to waste your time.

53:18.586 --> 53:19.717
I am.

53:19.718 --> 53:21.240
I have a registered

Robin.

53:49.138 --> 53:50.748
So they've, uh,

53:50.749 --> 53:52.315
"temporarily restricted

53:52.316 --> 53:55.405
my practice of laparoscopy
and laparotomy."

53:55.406 --> 53:57.016
Suspended me.

53:57.712 --> 53:59.278
It's fucking...

53:59.279 --> 54:03.282
It's just
ass-covering cowardice.

54:03.283 --> 54:05.110
It's unbelievable.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.765
Unbelievable! Anyway.

[phone ringing]

55:47.735 --> 55:49.301
[Elizabeth] Hello again.

55:49.302 --> 55:51.434
Mrs. Taylor...

55:51.435 --> 55:53.436
from the conference.

55:53.437 --> 55:54.786
Please sit down.

55:57.136 --> 56:00.182
You're here to talk about
the publishing of data?

56:01.445 --> 56:02.489
I am, yes.

56:03.534 --> 56:04.622
Look... [clears throat]

56:05.623 --> 56:07.798
there's no easy
way to say this,

56:07.799 --> 56:11.192
but our priority
isn't to shelter

56:11.193 --> 56:13.412
surgeons from criticism.

56:13.413 --> 56:15.936
Our priority is deciding
what's good for everybody,

56:15.937 --> 56:17.721
most importantly, the public,

56:17.722 --> 56:19.418
our patients.

56:19.419 --> 56:21.202
I understand that
the methodology

56:21.203 --> 56:22.856
may not yet be perfect,

56:22.857 --> 56:25.250
but I believe transparency
is a good thing.

56:25.251 --> 56:27.470
And we can improve
the methodology over time.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.036
[Elizabeth] The decisions
that we have to make

56:29.037 --> 56:31.299
in theatre in
fractions of seconds

56:31.300 --> 56:34.955
are boiled down to
"they lived" or "they died."

56:34.956 --> 56:38.916
No context, no case histories,

56:38.917 --> 56:40.178
just "they lived"
or "they died."

56:40.179 --> 56:41.963
That's not transparency.

56:43.225 --> 56:45.140
It's looking for
someone to blame.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.754
I understand what you're saying.

56:50.755 --> 56:52.103
- [Elizabeth] Do you?
- Yes.

56:52.104 --> 56:56.455
But once we pass
this first storm,

56:56.456 --> 56:59.937
hopefully then we can
focus on worthy things,

56:59.938 --> 57:01.591
such as risk adjustment.

57:01.592 --> 57:03.202
Risk adjustment?

57:04.638 --> 57:06.987
[Te] Have you heard of Z51.5?

57:06.988 --> 57:09.903
That's a code for palliative
care in the UK system.

57:09.904 --> 57:13.429
A Z51.5 doesn't go on
anyone's stats because it says

57:13.430 --> 57:15.387
that the patient was already
dying when they came in.

57:15.388 --> 57:17.476
Patients died quietly.

57:17.477 --> 57:19.391
No chemo, no scalpels,

57:19.392 --> 57:22.046
just morphine and flowers.

57:22.047 --> 57:24.788
Would my sepsis have qualified?

57:24.789 --> 57:25.919
Do you understand?

57:25.920 --> 57:27.574
Should I have not intervened?

57:29.358 --> 57:33.319
Maybe, it's better for
the patients that way.

57:34.494 --> 57:38.758
Maybe, because at times
it's best not to operate.

57:38.759 --> 57:40.978
Let them die with dignity.

57:40.979 --> 57:42.675
And maybe the publishing of data

57:42.676 --> 57:46.463
will mean that more people
die with less intervention.

57:47.681 --> 57:50.161
You know what's best
for patients, do you?

57:50.162 --> 57:51.990
Sitting here at your keyboard?

57:54.209 --> 57:56.994
I know your reputation,
Mrs. Taylor.

57:56.995 --> 57:58.517
You're the best at what you do.

57:58.518 --> 57:59.997
[Elizabeth]
One of.

57:59.998 --> 58:02.914
But is what you do always
best for the patients?

58:05.046 --> 58:07.308
I'm sorry that sounds tough.
I know.

58:07.309 --> 58:10.268
But hospitals hide
these things, don't they?

58:10.269 --> 58:12.662
Staff learn to hide things,

58:12.663 --> 58:14.402
and patients never know
anything went wrong.

58:14.403 --> 58:16.884
And the ones hurt the most
are the families left behind.

58:18.190 --> 58:20.453
We must hold ourselves
to a higher standard.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.064
I have a standard.

58:24.065 --> 58:26.023
It's the Hippocratic Oath.

58:26.024 --> 58:27.765
And I'm not trying
to hide anything.

58:33.118 --> 58:35.729
[birds chirping]

58:44.129 --> 58:45.522
[door opens]

58:48.394 --> 58:50.614
- [Elizabeth] Hey!
- Well, hi.

58:51.223 --> 58:52.919
How are you?

58:52.920 --> 58:54.051
You good?

58:54.052 --> 58:55.879
[chuckles in disbelief]

58:55.880 --> 58:57.359
Did you forget
some of your stuff?

58:58.578 --> 59:00.100
No, I, um...

59:00.101 --> 59:02.974
I just... I came to get it.

59:07.631 --> 59:08.893
Well...

59:09.937 --> 59:10.938
Why?

59:15.595 --> 59:17.683
I can't be inside this, Liz.

59:17.684 --> 59:19.206
You'll be Dr A,

59:19.207 --> 59:20.556
Richard will be Dr B,

59:20.557 --> 59:22.688
and the nurses
will be there by name,

59:22.689 --> 59:23.863
and one of us will go down.

59:23.864 --> 59:24.995
That's just noise.

59:24.996 --> 59:26.911
[Robin] No, it's not noise.

59:27.302 --> 59:28.999
I need my job, Liz.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.567
[Elizabeth] Robin.

59:31.524 --> 59:33.003
Robin, I can protect you.

59:33.004 --> 59:34.135
[Robin] You can't.

59:38.357 --> 59:39.445
I'm done.

59:42.622 --> 59:43.580
There it is.

59:51.849 --> 59:53.719
- [Elizabeth] I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

59:53.720 --> 59:54.765
Just go.

59:56.897 --> 01:00:01.380
[melancholic music]

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:17.962
[sighs]

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:20.268
Fuck.

01:00:37.198 --> 01:00:39.157
[sad music]

01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:53.432
[sighs]

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:02.397
[sighs wearily]

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:16.803
[breathes sharply]

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:22.461
[foreboding music]

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:30.817
[grunting]

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.955
[thumping]

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:48.443
- [screaming]
- [insects buzzing]

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:11.684
[groans]

01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:50.636
[foreboding music continues]

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.967
[lock beeps]

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:36.595
[phone vibrates]

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.695
[phone notification]

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:52.654
Oh, fuck off, Richard.

01:04:06.059 --> 01:04:07.844
[bottles clanking]

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.687
[sombre music]

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.868
[dog barking on street]

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:41.878
[Elizabeth gasps]

01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:46.099
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:49.189
[tense music]

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:53.802
Atticus!

01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:57.023
Oh fuck! Atticus, here boy!

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:11.515
He's quiet. I didn't see him.

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:14.300
I forgot. I forgot the dog.

01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:16.173
- [vet] Right.
- I forgot him.

01:05:18.218 --> 01:05:20.176
- I forgot he was there.
- Okay.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:22.179
I'm just going to
check his heart, okay?

01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:26.443
Shhh.

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:28.098
[Atticus whimpers softly]

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:46.071
Yeah.

01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:48.161
He's not doing so good.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:50.598
Um...

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:54.124
I think it's time
to say goodbye.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.692
[sighs]

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.390
Right now?

01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:01.740
- Right now?
- [vet] Yeah.

01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:03.784
[vet] Okay.

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:06.397
- [Elizabeth] Right. Right.
- [Atticus whimpers softly]

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:09.878
- You ready?
- [Elizabeth] Mm-mm.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:17.016
[panting]

01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:31.899
You can...
You can put your hand on him.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.424
You can help him out.

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:41.388
[Atticus groans softly]

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.129
Good dog.

01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.392
[stifled cries]

01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:49.004
Yeah.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.049
I'm going to put
the needle in now, okay?

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.051
[Elizabeth] Mm.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.706
All right. Here we go.

01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.499
[stifled sobs]

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.989
Check his heart.

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:26.825
He's gone now.

01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:32.222
[Elizabeth cries]

01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:36.356
Would you like him cremated?

01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:42.319
[breathes deeply]

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.886
He's not mine.

01:07:46.018 --> 01:07:48.586
He's not... my dog.

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:53.895
He's not my dog.

01:07:57.812 --> 01:07:59.118
[sobbing]

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:06.081
You killed my dog.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.604
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:09.649
[Jessica] What is wrong with
you?
[sad cello music]

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:11.477
He's gone.

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:13.262
I'm sorry.

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:14.915
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.613
[Jessica mumbles]

01:08:16.614 --> 01:08:18.398
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.752
[crying]

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:30.628
[sad cello music continues]

01:08:34.588 --> 01:08:36.895
[Jessica sobs]

01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:41.639
[Elizabeth] I'm so,
I'm so sorry.

01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:49.821
[sad cello music continues]

01:09:09.971 --> 01:09:13.149
[birds squawking]

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.373
Jesus.

01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:22.941
[sighs wearily]

01:09:25.422 --> 01:09:27.250
[ringtone rings]

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.650
Hello, this is
Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor.

01:09:37.651 --> 01:09:39.522
I'm trying to
reach my registrar,

01:09:39.523 --> 01:09:40.915
Richard Whitehead.

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:43.266
<i>Could I get his address, please?</i>

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:47.183
[sombre music]

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.115
[knocking at door]

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.257
Richard?

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.696
Richard, pick up.

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:36.580
[phone ringing close-by]

01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:50.549
[gasps] Richard!

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.638
Richard!

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.163
Richard!

01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:57.427
[tense music]

01:10:58.036 --> 01:10:59.037
Jesus.

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:01.299
Fuck! Fuck!

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.040
Fucking stupid, stupid.

01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:07.262
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.828
Richard? Richard!

01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:10.874
Oh, Richard? Richard!

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:12.267
Richard.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.746
Oh, no, no, no.

01:11:13.747 --> 01:11:16.183
No, Richard!

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:18.577
[crying]

01:11:18.578 --> 01:11:22.321
You didn't.

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.410
You didn't.

01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.065
Please!

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:29.720
Fuck.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.463
Why?

01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:36.334
[crying]

01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:39.512
[sad music]

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.475
[whimpers softly]

01:12:00.533 --> 01:12:03.188
[water rushing]

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:25.993
[Andrew] Right.

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:31.258
You were there I'm told,
first responder.

01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:32.782
- I was, yes.
- I'm sorry.

01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:35.567
Thank you.
Stupid, stupid bugger.

01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:36.873
Yeah, sadly so.

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:39.092
But listen, the staff
don't know at present,

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:41.138
so do you think
you've got this in hand?

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.314
I-- Yes, of course.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.403
- I will, of course.
- [Andrew] What a business.

01:12:45.404 --> 01:12:47.797
For the hospital,
for the department,

01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:49.712
for everybody.

01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:52.149
So, I think you and I should
keep a lid on the gossip

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:54.412
and speculation
before it even starts.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:57.415
And, yeah, we've got to
keep control of the situation.

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:58.504
Right.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:02.202
Well, what...
What can I do, Andrew?

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:03.335
What can I do?

01:13:08.253 --> 01:13:10.603
Well, I think you probably
know what this is about.

01:13:11.909 --> 01:13:13.213
[Elizabeth] Right.

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:16.521
Yeah, it's not an uncommon
phenomenon, burnout.

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:18.697
But I think for the majority
of the staff here,

01:13:18.698 --> 01:13:19.916
this will be the first time.

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.093
So we need to
show a united front.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:25.531
Andrew...

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:29.970
Richard was not "burnt out."

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:35.584
Elizabeth, we need
one version of the truth,

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:37.194
for everybody's sake.

01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:39.110
How... How does
that work, exactly?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.637
Well, did you know my father
was a surgeon in Korea?

01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:47.247
He was a POW.

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:49.902
And when he dealt
with limb trauma,

01:13:49.903 --> 01:13:53.210
he would take them to
latrines for their examinations,

01:13:53.211 --> 01:13:55.125
where there were
millions of flies.

01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:56.256
You know what that means?

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:57.344
Maggots.

01:13:57.345 --> 01:13:59.259
But maggots do
their job very well.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:00.826
They debris dead flesh,

01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:02.741
they clean the wounds,

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:04.917
they never sleep,
they never take a break.

01:14:04.918 --> 01:14:08.444
They're vigilant, consistent,
persistent, trustworthy...

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.795
Unlike some people.

01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:16.146
What's the point?

01:14:16.147 --> 01:14:17.627
What are you getting at?

01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:23.501
Do you remember
you called me "stupid"

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:27.940
at the Mortality
and Morbidity meeting?

01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:30.944
You really were incredibly rude.

01:14:34.557 --> 01:14:35.993
That's what this is about?

01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.909
No...

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.345
[Elizabeth] No?

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:44.696
No, this hospital has invested
huge amount in you.

01:14:44.697 --> 01:14:46.785
You're a very
valuable commodity.

01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:49.048
You are brilliant,
but you are not easy.

01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:50.486
You're emotional.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.226
Yeah, emotional.

01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.141
I know it's not
fashionable to say it,

01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:57.579
but I'm not sure
women are suited

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.145
to a career in medicine,

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:00.931
particularly unmarried women.

01:15:02.193 --> 01:15:04.411
But when I have a vested
interest in someone,

01:15:04.412 --> 01:15:08.285
I act irrespective of the risk.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:10.027
So it is decided.

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:13.073
What has?
What's been decided?

01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.033
Honestly?

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:19.383
Sometimes, Elizabeth,
I could just, you know...

01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:21.212
take you or leave you.

01:15:22.996 --> 01:15:23.954
I see.

01:15:25.085 --> 01:15:26.565
[Andrew] No,
I don't think you do see.

01:15:27.697 --> 01:15:29.437
You've been given
a second chance.

01:15:30.613 --> 01:15:33.136
You're going to be back
on call after a week's leave.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:34.441
That's what we've decided.

01:15:34.442 --> 01:15:35.878
Then we're going
to publish an article

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:37.967
in the <i>New Zealand
Journal for Medicine</i>

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:39.272
and you're going
to sign up to it.

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:41.187
It'll be about suicide, burnout

01:15:41.188 --> 01:15:45.757
and, uh, Richard's
effect on your data.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:47.977
Richard will be shown
as what he was...

01:15:47.978 --> 01:15:50.588
young, ineffective,
out of his depths,

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:53.765
and that he skewed the data.

01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:55.550
You know, we took
too much care of him.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:57.116
<i>You</i> took too much care of him.

01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:58.901
And it's a tragedy
for the hospital,

01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:00.467
for the community,

01:16:00.468 --> 01:16:03.035
and it led to his suicide.

01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:05.124
So, uh...

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:06.604
you know, the staff
will get counselling,

01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:07.692
there'll be a vigil,

01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:11.828
and then business as usual.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.358
And I want you
to sign up to it all.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:28.453
It's called
"cleaning the wound," Elizabeth.

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:33.589
Like a maggot.

01:16:35.329 --> 01:16:37.767
Those wonderful maggots.

01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:41.901
[sad music]

01:16:45.078 --> 01:16:46.776
[breathes deeply]

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:02.139
[sniffles]

01:17:03.531 --> 01:17:05.229
Liz? Liz.

01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:09.232
[sobs]

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:10.321
I'm sorry.

01:17:12.105 --> 01:17:13.106
I'm sorry.

01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:20.897
- [Elizabeth cries]
- It's okay.

01:17:24.117 --> 01:17:25.771
It's all right.

01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:30.820
[sad music continues]

01:17:57.977 --> 01:18:00.284
[birds chirping]

01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:11.338
What?

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:15.734
It's just unfair.

01:18:18.998 --> 01:18:21.871
You are good, Liz.

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.090
I know that.

01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:29.704
I missed his calls.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.270
I could have taken them.

01:18:31.271 --> 01:18:32.316
[Robin] Yeah.

01:18:35.319 --> 01:18:36.842
And you'll have
to live with that.

01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:39.802
And I am so sorry.

01:18:44.502 --> 01:18:45.851
[sighs] Me, too.

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:48.767
So fucking sorry.

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:51.074
What a mess.

01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:53.076
[sighs]

01:18:58.821 --> 01:19:01.432
[dramatic music]

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:10.919
[Ben] Jan, I was wondering--

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.311
Dr. Matthews?

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.399
Yes.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.792
Excuse us a minute.

01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:16.141
[Ben] How can I help?

01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:20.058
I wanted to speak with you
about a patient of ours.

01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:21.146
Lisa Williams.

01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:22.192
Yes.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.848
Um, if it's okay, I'd like to
bring Jan in on this.

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.806
She was running the ward.

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.329
Jan.

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:31.375
Of course.

01:19:32.289 --> 01:19:33.550
[Ben] Okay.

01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:35.900
Jan, this is about
Lisa Williams,

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:37.119
the sepsis patient
from a while ago.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.207
Oh.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.382
Mrs. Taylor was her surgeon

01:19:39.383 --> 01:19:40.992
and wants to know
about her admission.

01:19:40.993 --> 01:19:42.254
- Okay.
- Please.

01:19:42.255 --> 01:19:46.737
Okay. Well, we had
her on the usual lines,

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:50.175
inspected the surgery sites,
and they were clean.

01:19:50.176 --> 01:19:52.264
There was minimal
output in the drains.

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.571
Her abdomen was soft.

01:19:54.572 --> 01:19:56.616
Well, you tell her, Jan.

01:19:56.617 --> 01:19:59.228
I sat with Lisa from
about midnight.

01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:01.273
She was pretty high
maintenance at this point,

01:20:01.274 --> 01:20:03.885
and she began
to go into decline.

01:20:03.886 --> 01:20:06.758
She was deteriorating.
The sepsis was advanced.

01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:10.500
[Jan] She called out.
She was anxious and agitated.

01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:12.458
[Ben] She was
dropping her stats,

01:20:12.459 --> 01:20:14.199
and cyanosis of the lips,

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.766
about one breath every second.

01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:18.769
[Jan] She was complaining
of being cold and tired,

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:20.205
and the catheter
was bothering her,

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:22.034
and her breathing
was very rapid.

01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:26.690
We brought in the on-call
anaesthetist to intubate.

01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:29.171
Was Lisa able to
speak with her parents?

01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:31.130
Yeah, briefly.

01:20:32.218 --> 01:20:33.828
But then they had
to leave the room.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.699
She arrested during induction,

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.223
and we began resuscitation.

01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:41.705
We worked for...
half an hour, I remember.

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:42.880
[Jan] She was 29.

01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:45.274
A young, strong woman.

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.623
[Elizabeth]
Right.

01:20:46.624 --> 01:20:47.668
Yeah.

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:52.890
[Ben] Pronounced dead
about four... five--

01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:55.633
- 4:48.
- [Ben] 4:48. Yes.

01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:57.461
Wee small hours.

01:20:59.811 --> 01:21:00.812
Yeah.

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:04.337
[sighs]

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:07.687
Thank you for
caring for my patient.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:08.993
[Ben] Is that what you...

01:21:08.994 --> 01:21:10.125
Is that what you needed?

01:21:10.126 --> 01:21:11.561
It is, yes. Some of it.

01:21:11.562 --> 01:21:13.389
[Ben] I can get some more notes.

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:14.999
- I can--
- No.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.916
No, it's all right.

01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:21.964
Was she lonely
at all at the end?

01:21:23.269 --> 01:21:24.575
We were all here.

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:28.230
Her family, right up
until the intubation.

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.059
I was with her during the night.

01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:34.497
Thank you both.

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:37.675
This very... was very helpful.

01:21:38.763 --> 01:21:41.244
[dramatic music]

01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:08.140
[microphone squelches]

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.101
[clears throat]

01:22:13.711 --> 01:22:16.844
Tena koutou, tena koutou,
tena katou katoa.

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:19.891
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:22.545
My name is Andrew McGrath.

01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:26.288
As you know,
I am head of surgery.

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:27.898
Sad day.

01:22:27.899 --> 01:22:31.206
And we are here, unfortunately,

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.816
to remember Richard Whitehead,

01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:35.036
one of our brightest
young talents

01:22:35.037 --> 01:22:38.127
whose future has been
so cruelly cut short.

01:22:39.215 --> 01:22:40.345
And in a few moments,

01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:43.740
I would like us to
hold a silence while

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:46.482
we remember Richard
and the brilliant work he did,

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:48.092
the part he played in the team

01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:51.052
of one of our most gifted,
accomplished surgeons,

01:22:51.053 --> 01:22:54.099
Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor.

01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:58.146
But before we do,
I would like to say this.

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:01.714
What we now know is
that Richard's passing

01:23:01.715 --> 01:23:07.156
is the result of the terrible
toll of burnout.

01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:10.201
This is a tragedy,

01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:12.551
but one from which
we will all learn,

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:14.250
<i>must</i> learn.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.731
Richard's passing is
a timely reminder to us

01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:22.387
that all our staff
are vulnerable

01:23:22.388 --> 01:23:24.999
to these extreme pressures.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.088
And unfortunately,

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:31.006
Richard was, um,
one of its victims.

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:33.268
It's not easy having to work

01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:35.400
with the responsibility
of life and death.

01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:38.795
We, the hospital,
the administration, the board,

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:42.668
we absolutely recognize this,

01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:45.803
and, um, we are
responding immediately.

01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:49.675
We are, from this moment,

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:53.027
putting in place measures
to enhance staff well being

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.726
and our collective
mental health,

01:23:56.727 --> 01:23:58.728
soon as is practicable.

01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:02.559
Because we are all in this
together,

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:04.821
a team

01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:06.649
and a community.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.954
[sighs]

01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:11.437
It is indeed
a sad day for us all.

01:24:13.396 --> 01:24:15.963
A minute's silence, please.

01:24:20.707 --> 01:24:22.361
[sighs]

01:24:35.461 --> 01:24:38.246
I'd like to say something.
I think I should. Don't you?

01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:39.334
- [Andrew] Yeah.
- I think I should.

01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:40.335
[Andrew] Yes.
Just a short.

01:24:40.336 --> 01:24:41.553
Yeah, as his registrar,

01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:43.120
don't you think
I should say something?

01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.470
[clears throat] Sorry.

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:49.344
I'd like to say something,
if it's all right.

01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:50.867
Thank you.

01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:52.043
Hello.

01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:53.827
[sighs]

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.050
The reason we're all here
today is, as Andrew says,

01:25:00.051 --> 01:25:01.313
a tragedy.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:06.057
Richard Whitehead
was my registrar.

01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:09.712
Many of you knew Richard,
and those of you who didn't,

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.844
I'm sure you can
identify with him.

01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:14.718
He was a young man, 26.

01:25:15.632 --> 01:25:18.764
And as a registrar,
he was still learning,

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:20.071
still training.

01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:22.638
He didn't die.

01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:24.380
He committed suicide.

01:25:27.296 --> 01:25:31.430
And, um, he's dead now
because he overdosed.

01:25:32.388 --> 01:25:33.736
That's the truth of it.

01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:37.610
He took his own life in
a filthy garage, alone.

01:25:38.785 --> 01:25:40.960
Elizabeth, that's enough.

01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.614
[Elizabeth] We talk
about teamwork.

01:25:42.615 --> 01:25:44.226
- Liz--
- We talk about resilience.

01:25:45.444 --> 01:25:47.402
Did Richard lack resilience?

01:25:47.403 --> 01:25:49.491
This young man for whom
I am responsible?

01:25:49.492 --> 01:25:51.841
Because if you're telling me
he lacks something,

01:25:51.842 --> 01:25:52.886
I don't accept it.

01:25:55.889 --> 01:26:01.286
I operated on a patient
that died after the surgery.

01:26:02.331 --> 01:26:04.506
Richard was under
my supervision,

01:26:04.507 --> 01:26:05.812
and he did as I asked.

01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:09.293
I told him to push harder,

01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:11.208
and I chose the timing,

01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:12.731
and I chose the words I said,

01:26:12.732 --> 01:26:15.212
and I chose the way I said them.

01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:16.519
And he just...

01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:20.436
It's my responsibility.

01:26:22.002 --> 01:26:24.265
I am responsible
for the risks I take

01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:25.876
every time I perform surgery.

01:26:26.703 --> 01:26:31.228
And Richard is dead
because he blamed himself

01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:33.188
for a mistake I made.

01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:40.238
I didn't make my responsibility
clear enough to him.

01:26:41.674 --> 01:26:43.633
He was a student doctor.

01:26:47.463 --> 01:26:49.204
And...

01:26:51.728 --> 01:26:53.468
And we're hanging

01:26:53.469 --> 01:26:55.252
a target around his neck

01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:56.385
with this vigil.

01:26:58.604 --> 01:26:59.823
[speakers squelch]

01:27:01.303 --> 01:27:04.174
And I'm not going
to let this boy

01:27:04.175 --> 01:27:06.133
be scapegoated publicly

01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:10.964
by middle managers
and doctors-turned-bureaucrats.

01:27:13.358 --> 01:27:15.490
We are in service.

01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:17.796
We have a covenant
with our patients.

01:27:17.797 --> 01:27:19.538
"I will save you
with my skills."

01:27:21.497 --> 01:27:23.499
But we have a covenant
to each other.

01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:26.588
We're in service
to each other, too.

01:27:26.589 --> 01:27:29.940
Both those covenants are
being broken here today,

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:32.682
and I will not stand by

01:27:33.987 --> 01:27:37.295
and help pretend
that's not the case.

01:27:40.124 --> 01:27:41.212
That's enough.

01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:47.740
[crowd applauding]

01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:57.271
Rest in peace, Richard.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.621
Rest in peace.

01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:04.888
[melancholic music]

01:29:32.932 --> 01:29:35.892
[breathes deeply]

01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:49.949
This is what happened.

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:56.216
Lisa was very sick.

01:29:57.479 --> 01:29:59.045
She had septicemia.

01:30:01.134 --> 01:30:05.574
Although the original operation
was marred by an error I made,

01:30:07.924 --> 01:30:09.186
without that error,

01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:14.626
it's highly likely
she would have still died.

01:30:16.454 --> 01:30:18.717
The sepsis was advanced.

01:30:24.027 --> 01:30:25.507
[sighs weakly]

01:30:27.552 --> 01:30:29.074
Ev...

01:30:29.075 --> 01:30:32.731
Even though
your operation went wrong...

01:30:34.864 --> 01:30:36.605
she still could have died?

01:30:42.785 --> 01:30:43.786
Yes.

01:30:45.744 --> 01:30:46.745
Yes.

01:30:51.315 --> 01:30:52.403
Yes.

01:30:56.886 --> 01:30:58.322
[inhales sharply]

01:31:00.324 --> 01:31:01.890
Is there anything

01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:03.719
you would have
done differently?

01:31:10.813 --> 01:31:12.292
That's the hard bit.

01:31:13.337 --> 01:31:14.381
No.

01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:16.645
I would not.

01:31:18.429 --> 01:31:21.650
All the decisions I made
were to try to save Lisa.

01:31:22.955 --> 01:31:24.782
If the operation
were to happen again,

01:31:24.783 --> 01:31:27.307
I could make all
the same decisions.

01:31:31.224 --> 01:31:33.487
But I would endeavour

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:36.142
to be better at explaining it,

01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:41.104
be better at taking
responsibility.

01:31:43.889 --> 01:31:45.630
I allowed doubt to creep in.

01:31:58.295 --> 01:31:59.557
Lisa fought.

01:32:00.732 --> 01:32:02.124
She fought really, really hard.

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:03.343
You need to know that.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:09.088
In the end, her body gave up,

01:32:11.047 --> 01:32:12.222
des...

01:32:13.658 --> 01:32:16.531
despite all our
experience and care.

01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:19.272
And please know

01:32:20.491 --> 01:32:22.493
that your daughter
was cared for.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.946
[breathes deeply]

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:46.648
I wanted a good
outcome for Lisa.

01:32:48.824 --> 01:32:50.303
And I'm so sorry.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:32.781
Thank you.

01:33:38.482 --> 01:33:40.615
[sombre music]

01:34:03.376 --> 01:34:05.814
[hopeful music]

01:35:03.436 --> 01:35:06.352
[hopeful music continues]

01:35:56.925 --> 01:35:59.841
[hopeful music continues]

01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:22.646
[gentle music]

01:36:50.152 --> 01:36:53.895
[gentle dramatic music]

01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:54.477
[gentle dramatic
music continues]

01:38:51.186 --> 01:38:55.190
[gentle dramatic
music continues]

01:39:50.593 --> 01:39:54.727
[gentle dramatic
music continues]
