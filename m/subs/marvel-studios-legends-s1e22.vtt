00:30.321 --> 00:31.990
I chose my people.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.659
I chose Wakanda.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.370
My name is King T'Challa...

00:38.246 --> 00:39.497
son of King T'Chaka.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.583
Our future depended...

00:41.666 --> 00:42.667
You were wrong!

00:43.752 --> 00:45.086
All of you were wrong!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.923
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

00:50.050 --> 00:53.470
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.722
Share what we have.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.640
We could provide aid...

00:58.016 --> 01:00.643
and access to technology
and refuge to those who need it.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.687
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.901
T'- Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.527
We cannot.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.072
We must not.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.366
We will work to be an example of how we...

01:15.450 --> 01:17.869
as brothers and sisters on this earth...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.329
should treat each other.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.956
Now, more than ever...

01:23.249 --> 01:25.960
More connects us than separates us.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.171
But in times of crisis...

01:28.630 --> 01:30.924
the wise build bridges...

01:31.299 --> 01:33.176
while the foolish build barriers.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.595
Who are you?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.515
T'- We must find a way...

01:38.932 --> 01:41.017
to look after one another...

01:41.726 --> 01:45.772
as if we were one, single tribe.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.902
N'- Millions of years ago...

01:50.985 --> 01:53.029
a meteorite made of vibranium,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.490
the strongest substance
in the universe...

01:55.824 --> 01:57.909
struck the continent of Africa...

01:59.160 --> 02:01.329
...affecting the plant life around it.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.331
And when the time of man came,

02:03.414 --> 02:07.794
a warrior shaman received a vision
from the Panther Goddess Bast...

02:07.877 --> 02:10.755
who led him to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

02:11.631 --> 02:17.178
a plant that granted him superhuman
strength, speed and instincts.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.139
The warrior became king...

02:19.222 --> 02:21.432
and the first Black Panther...

02:21.516 --> 02:23.685
the protector of Wakanda.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.896
- At a special
United Nations conference...

02:26.980 --> 02:31.776
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.028
-Get down!

02:43.705 --> 02:46.791
-- I didn't kill your father.
-T'- Then why did you run?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.884
T'- Because your friend
murdered my father...

02:55.967 --> 02:57.177
I ask you,

02:57.594 --> 02:59.929
as both warrior and king...

03:02.348 --> 03:05.435
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?

03:06.728 --> 03:07.770
Barnes is mine.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.648
You're after the wrong guy.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.568
The psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.281
T'- My father is dead, Nakia.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.701
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.371
And I wish for you to be there.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.382
This never gets old.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.846
How are you feeling today, Mama?

03:42.388 --> 03:43.431
Proud.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.687
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

03:51.522 --> 03:52.690
He is with us.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.236
And it is your time to be king.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.241
- M'Baku, what are you doing here?

04:03.368 --> 04:04.577
It's challenge day.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.086
Show him who you are!

04:21.970 --> 04:24.097
- I now present to you...

04:24.889 --> 04:26.849
King T'Challa...

04:29.018 --> 04:31.020
...the Black Panther.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.689
Wakanda forever!

04:32.772 --> 04:34.482
- Wakanda forever!

04:38.278 --> 04:39.279


04:42.031 --> 04:43.074


04:46.744 --> 04:47.745
Breathe.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.873
T'- I am not ready
to be without you.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.629
Tell me how to best protect Wakanda.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.591
I want to be a great king, Baba.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.677
Just like you.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.555
T'- You're going to struggle.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.891
So you'll need to surround yourself
with people you trust.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.604
You're a good man with a good heart.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.650
And it's hard for a good man to be king.

05:19.944 --> 05:23.197
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

05:23.281 --> 05:24.782
but I can't stay.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.075
I can't be happy here...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.703
knowing that there's people out there
who have nothing.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.374
About two billion people
all over the world that looks like us.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.668
Wakanda has the tools to liberate 'em all.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.919
What do you want?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.755
I want the throne.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.214
Do not do this, T'Challa.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.137
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

05:53.353 --> 05:54.479
-No.
-No!

05:57.106 --> 05:58.900
No!

06:03.529 --> 06:05.907
- We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb to Jabariland.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.160
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.788
- I call upon the ancestors.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.831
I call upon Bast.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.710
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.295
T'- In my culture...

06:20.004 --> 06:22.507
death is not the end.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.470
It's more of a stepping-off point.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.222
Wake up, T'Challa.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.058
Wake up.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.021
I cannot stay here with you.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.318
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.572
He is a monster of our own making.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.327
Speak nothing of this.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.122
- You ain't the son
of a king. You a son of a murderer.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
I must right these wrongs.

06:55.873 --> 06:59.043
You can't let your father's mistakes
define who you are.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.878
T'- I am not my father.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.055
You get to decide what kind of king
you are going to be.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.231
When you said we were going to open
Wakanda to the rest of the world,

07:20.314 --> 07:21.732
this is not what I imagined.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.903
T'- How big of an assault
should we expect?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.614
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.455
T'- Evacuate the city.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.415
Engage all defenses.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.417
And get this man a shield.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.339
Wakanda forever!

07:51.053 --> 07:55.183
T'- The Black Panther has been the
protector of Wakanda for generations.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.729
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
