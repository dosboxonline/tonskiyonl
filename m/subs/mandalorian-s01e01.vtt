WEBVTT

00:50.509 --> 00:52.386
Please. Please.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.972
I have credits. Take them.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.735
He says you spilled his drink.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.742
It's fine.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.827
It's on me.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.335
Here.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.494
Thank you! Thank you very much!

02:41.119 --> 02:44.289
You have my heartfelt gratitude.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.254
You know what? Here.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.713
You take my credits.

02:52.548 --> 02:53.757
Buy yourself a drink.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.594
Oh.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.929
Is that a bounty puck?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.767
Is that me?

03:07.396 --> 03:08.397
Look...

03:08.480 --> 03:10.524
Uh, there must be some mistake.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.234
I can get you more credits.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.861
I can bring you in warm...

03:15.654 --> 03:17.406
Or I can bring you in cold.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.641
I need passage to the yards.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.491
No droids.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.395
Where to?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.287
You know what he's looking for?

04:47.371 --> 04:49.289
You're looking for Ravinaks, right?

04:49.373 --> 04:51.291
It's clear right now.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.127
But be careful near the port.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.922
Everyone dumps their Gray Holds out.

04:57.005 --> 05:01.134
They think the whole entire planet
is their own personal stink pit.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.813
Here you are.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.067
- You're kidding me, right?
- Get out.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.029
I'll hire us a Livery Cruiser.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.156
No big deal.
It won't come out of your end.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.491
I'll pay for it.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.994
I'm just trying to make it pleasant.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.162
Hey, it's time to go, so let's settle up.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.460
I'd stay off the ice if I were you.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.299
You think there's really something
to worry about?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.106
Open the hatch! Open the hatch!

06:13.373 --> 06:15.209
Dank farrik, that was close!

06:15.626 --> 06:17.711
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.795
"Stay off the ice."

06:18.879 --> 06:20.756
That's the understatement
of the millennium.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.224
It's taking us down. What're you doing?

06:33.977 --> 06:36.188
It's got us. It's gonna take us under.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.440
Where you going?

06:38.524 --> 06:40.567
You gotta do something!
We gotta get out of here!

07:00.128 --> 07:03.006
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.716
Yes. All right.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.860
Whew.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.698
I like your ship. She's a classic.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.034
Razor Crest, am I right?

07:32.411 --> 07:33.620
Pre-Empire?

07:35.998 --> 07:37.916
I have a lot of credits, by the way.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.960
That's why I offered to hail a Cruiser.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.968
How much are they paying you?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.766
Is it true that you guys
never take off your helmets?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.980
Boy.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.609
I think I have to use the vacc tube.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.904
I mean I can do it here,

08:07.779 --> 08:11.033
but if you've never seen
a Fledgling Mythrol evacuate their thorax,

08:11.116 --> 08:12.618
you're a lucky guy, trust me.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.958
Clearly, there's nowhere for me to go.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.460
So, uh...

08:22.044 --> 08:24.630
I'm gonna look for that vacc tube
if it's all the same to you?

08:25.714 --> 08:26.757
Great.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.230
Found it!

08:41.980 --> 08:44.441
Thanks. It might take a while.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.901
I'm molting.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.129
Oh, this feels a lot better.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.049
I haven't evacuated since the solstice.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.722
Yeah.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.934
I was hoping to be free for Life Day.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.144
Maybe even, uh...

09:26.108 --> 09:28.819
Get home to the family.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.120
But I guess that's
not gonna happen this year.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.538
Probably not.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.901
Ah, that was fast.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.111
Did you catch them all?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.744
Good. I'll begin the off-load.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.632
These are Imperial Credits.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.425
They still spend.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.845
I don't know if you heard,
but the Empire is gone.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.763
It's all I've got.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.851
Save the theatrics.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.644
Fine, I'll...

11:27.646 --> 11:29.481
I can do Calamari Flan...

11:30.065 --> 11:31.859
But I can only pay half.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.530
Fine.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.675
Hmm.
I have a bail jumper...

11:57.843 --> 11:59.386
A bail jumper,

12:00.053 --> 12:03.182
another bail jumper, a wanted smuggler.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.474
I'll take them all.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.809
No. Hold on.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.689
There are other members of the Guild,
and this is all I have.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.024
Why so slow?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.526
It's not slow at all, actually. Very busy.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.945
They just don't want to pay Guild rates.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.573
They don't mind if things get sloppy.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.076
-What's your highest bounty?
-Not much.

12:23.744 --> 12:24.786
Five thousand.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.955
That won't even cover fuel these days.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.790
Hmm.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.586
There is one job.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.924
Let's see the puck.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.509
No puck.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.385
Face to face.

12:40.886 --> 12:41.970
Direct commission.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.056
Deep pocket.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.599
Underworld?

12:47.392 --> 12:50.437
All I know is no chain code.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.358
Do you want the chit or not?

14:24.865 --> 14:28.118
Greef Karga said you were coming.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.211
What else did he say?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.631
He said you were the best in the parsec.

14:45.969 --> 14:46.970
- Freeze!
- No!

14:47.054 --> 14:48.055
Drop your weapons!

14:48.764 --> 14:50.182
No, no, no, no.
Pardon. Uh, sorry.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.268
I didn't mean to alarm.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.939
This is Doctor Pershing.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.692
Please excuse his lack of decorum.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.364
His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.574
Please lower your blaster.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.493
Have them lower theirs first.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.286
We have you four to one.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.413
I like those odds.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.754
He also said you were expensive.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.881
Very expensive.

15:23.382 --> 15:24.550
Please sit.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.659
Beskar?

15:50.742 --> 15:52.953
Go ahead. It's real.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.166
This is only a down payment.

15:58.792 --> 16:04.423
I have a camtono of Beskar waiting for you
upon delivery of the asset.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.507
Alive.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.384
Yes. Alive.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.761
Although, I acknowledge

16:10.220 --> 16:13.640
that bounty hunting
is a complicated profession.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.893
This being the case,

16:16.435 --> 16:21.732
proof of termination is also acceptable
for a lower fee.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.443
That is not what we agreed upon.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.321
I'm simply being pragmatic.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.240
Let's see the puck.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.493
I'm afraid discretion dictates

16:34.369 --> 16:36.955
a less traditional agreement.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.000
We can only offer you a tracking fob.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.173
What's the chain code?

16:46.715 --> 16:49.927
We can only provide the last four digits.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.764
Their age? That's all you can give me?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.184
Yes. They're 50 years old.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.813
We can also give you
last reported positional data.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.733
Between that and the fob,

17:04.816 --> 17:08.612
a man of your skill
should make short work of this.

17:17.955 --> 17:22.751
The Beskar belongs back
into the hands of a Mandalorian.

17:23.377 --> 17:26.713
It is good to restore
the natural order of things

17:26.797 --> 17:29.299
after a period of such disarray,

17:30.300 --> 17:31.677
don't you agree?

19:40.013 --> 19:42.516
This was gathered
in the Great Purge.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.352
It is good it is back with the Tribe.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.104
Yes.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.982
A pauldron would be in order.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.069
-Has your signet been revealed?
-Not yet.

19:54.862 --> 19:55.988
Soon.

20:30.272 --> 20:35.068
This is extremely generous.
The excess will sponsor many Foundlings.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.070
That's good.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.656
I was once a Foundling.

20:39.740 --> 20:40.782
I know.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.709
Thank you.

23:39.086 --> 23:41.088
You are a bounty hunter.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.298
Yes.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.679
I will help you.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.016
I have spoken.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.369
Many have passed through.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.913
They seek the same one as you.

24:15.581 --> 24:16.748
Did you help them?

24:17.082 --> 24:18.292
Yes.

24:19.001 --> 24:20.127
They died.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.839
Well, then I don't know
if I want your help.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.508
You do.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.052
I can show you to the encampment.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.721
What's your cut?

24:30.804 --> 24:31.972
Half.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.558
Half the bounty to guide? Seems steep.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.604
No. Half of the blurrg you helped capture.

24:38.687 --> 24:41.023
The blurrg? You can keep them both.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.816
No, you will need one.

24:43.609 --> 24:44.693
To ride.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.572
The way is impossible to pass
without a blurrg mount.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.200
I don't know how to ride blurrg.

24:52.451 --> 24:53.785
I have spoken.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.880
Perhaps if you removed your helmet.

25:04.963 --> 25:07.382
Perhaps he remembers I tried to roast him.

25:07.799 --> 25:12.221
This is a female.
The males are all eaten during mating.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.085
I don't have time for this.

25:43.669 --> 25:46.630
Do you have a Landspeeder
or Speeder bike that I could hire?

25:46.713 --> 25:48.090
You are Mandalorian!

25:49.925 --> 25:53.095
Your ancestors rode the great Mythosaur.

25:54.263 --> 25:57.057
Surely you can ride this young foal.

26:13.490 --> 26:16.076
Easy. Easy.

26:17.119 --> 26:19.955
Now, all right. Settle down.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.040
Whoa!

26:22.124 --> 26:24.585
Settle. Settle.

26:26.295 --> 26:27.963
That's good. That's good.

26:31.133 --> 26:33.427
Easy. Okay.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.846
That's good.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.265
All right.

26:50.569 --> 26:51.570
Oh!

27:40.786 --> 27:43.372
That is where you'll find your quarry.

27:47.876 --> 27:50.254
Please. You deserve this.

27:50.337 --> 27:52.381
Since these ones arrived,

27:52.464 --> 27:55.342
this territory has been an endless stream

27:55.425 --> 27:59.721
of mercenaries seeking reward
and bringing destruction.

28:00.556 --> 28:02.140
Then why did you guide me?

28:02.224 --> 28:04.101
They do not belong here.

28:04.184 --> 28:07.104
Those that live here come to seek peace.

28:07.187 --> 28:10.274
There will be no peace until they're gone.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.526
Then why do you help?

28:13.694 --> 28:15.904
I have never met a Mandalorian.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.407
I've only read the stories.

28:20.617 --> 28:24.454
If they are true,
you will make quick work of it.

28:25.247 --> 28:27.916
Then there will again be peace.

28:32.296 --> 28:33.630
I have spoken.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.465
Oh, no.

29:17.216 --> 29:18.383
Bounty Droid.

29:19.301 --> 29:22.304
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

29:22.387 --> 29:25.474
compels you to immediately
produce said asset.

29:45.202 --> 29:46.245
Droids.

29:48.872 --> 29:52.167
Subparagraph 16 of
the Bondsman Guild protocol waiver

29:52.251 --> 29:55.087
compels you to immediately produce
said asset.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.922
IG Unit! Stand down.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.679
I'm in the Guild!

30:03.762 --> 30:05.138
You are a Guild member?

30:05.222 --> 30:08.100
I thought I was the only one
on assignment.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.060
That makes two of us.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.312
So much for the element of surprise.

30:12.396 --> 30:14.064
Sadly, I must ask for your fob.

30:14.147 --> 30:17.442
I have already issued the writ of seizure.
The bounty is mine.

30:17.526 --> 30:21.113
Unless I'm mistaken,
you are, as of yet, empty-handed.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.406
This is true.

30:22.781 --> 30:24.575
- I have a suggestion.
- Proceed.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.034
We split the reward.

30:26.827 --> 30:28.287
This is acceptable.

30:28.370 --> 30:32.332
Great. Now let's regroup,
out of harm's way, and form a plan.

30:32.416 --> 30:35.294
I will of course receive
the reputation merits

30:35.377 --> 30:36.795
associated with the mission.

30:36.879 --> 30:38.463
Can we talk about this later?

30:40.382 --> 30:43.010
I require an answer if I am to proceed...

30:43.093 --> 30:45.262
Oh, no. Alert. Alert. Alert.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.308
Oh!

30:54.396 --> 30:56.648
Let's go!

31:17.544 --> 31:18.795
He's in there!

31:18.879 --> 31:19.922
Affirmative.

31:36.813 --> 31:38.148
Up top!

31:51.495 --> 31:52.746
It appears we are trapped.

31:53.455 --> 31:56.375
I will initiate self-destruct sequencing.

31:57.835 --> 31:59.253
Whoa, you're what?

31:59.336 --> 32:02.256
Manufacturers Protocol dictates
I cannot be captured.

32:02.339 --> 32:05.551
-I must self-destruct.
-Do not self-destruct.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.177
Cover me!

32:25.821 --> 32:28.490
Go! Go! Go!
There's too many!

32:36.331 --> 32:37.624
They got us pinned.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.299
I will initiate self-destruct.

32:45.382 --> 32:48.051
Do not self-destruct!
We're shooting our way out.

32:52.264 --> 32:53.307
Okay.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.518
New plan!

33:01.190 --> 33:02.691
Beginning self-destruct countdown.

33:02.774 --> 33:03.859
No! Stop it!

33:06.778 --> 33:08.822
Draw their fire, I'll take it out.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.407
- Acceptable.
- Go!

33:42.648 --> 33:43.774
Well done.

33:45.484 --> 33:48.028
I will disengage self-destruct initiative.

33:51.949 --> 33:53.408
You know, you're not so bad.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.161
- For a droid.
- Agreed.

33:56.245 --> 33:58.455
That blaster hit looks nasty. You okay?

33:58.830 --> 34:00.666
Running a quick diagnostic.

34:02.543 --> 34:04.503
It has missed my central wiring harness.

34:04.586 --> 34:05.587
Is that good?

34:06.213 --> 34:07.339
Yes.

34:07.673 --> 34:09.883
Well,
now we just need to get the door open.

34:40.455 --> 34:41.748
Anyone else?

34:43.250 --> 34:45.210
The tracking fob is still active.

34:45.294 --> 34:48.755
My sensors indicate
that there is a life form present.

35:21.205 --> 35:22.456
Wait.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.249
They said 50 years old.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.044
Species age differently.

35:28.962 --> 35:31.507
Perhaps it could live many centuries.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.886
Sadly, we'll never know.

35:35.969 --> 35:37.304
No.

35:38.639 --> 35:40.182
We'll bring it in alive.

35:40.641 --> 35:45.437
The commission was quite specific.
The asset was to be terminated.
