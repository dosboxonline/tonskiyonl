WEBVTT

02:19.973 --> 02:21.890
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.896
-You have everything?
-Yeah.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.107
Hurry up, sweetie. We're late.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.614
Ty. Today, papi.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.743
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.288
-Okay, let's go.
-lt's not my fault, Mom.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.419
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

02:50.587 --> 02:52.921
Ty! Hello? That's better.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.257
You don't have to listen
to that 24 hours a day.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.259
Wait. lt's Simon and Garfunkel.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.596
That's why I tell you to tie your shoes.
I know. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.974
-You can't just turn them off, Mom.
-l understand, baby. Come on.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.735
-Careful of the puddle.
-Why'd they break up?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.987
-Who?
-Simon and Garfunkel.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.949
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.126
Let's go.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.925
Will l get in trouble
if l didn't give my speech?

03:38.092 --> 03:39.635
Because I'm not really feeling it.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.846
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.432
-l can't wait to hear it.
-lt's boring.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.144
Not to me or to abuela
or to your dad.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.438
I thought we were meeting him after.

03:51.606 --> 03:55.943
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

03:56.110 --> 03:58.820
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.952
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.249
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.960
-You got something on your face there.
-Where?

04:13.127 --> 04:15.629
-Right there.
-Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.881
There it is. l got it!

04:23.846 --> 04:26.974
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-Hey, Ty.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.644
What's up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.689
I know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.482
-Mom!
-What?

04:35.650 --> 04:40.028
-Please.
-l'm sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.156
I love you.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.620
Have a good day.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.594
-Morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Cora? How my diamonds?

05:45.762 --> 05:49.723
-They're hanging with your rubies.
-l like the sound of that.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.233
-Just made it, Marisa.
-l always do.

06:17.585 --> 06:21.505
-Good morning, Marisa.
-What's up, Keef?

06:21.672 --> 06:25.759
How's the weather?
Sunshine. That's nice.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.469
Anything good on?

06:31.891 --> 06:35.018
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.563
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, I'd kick him out too.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.275
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.236
I like how you name the people.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.364
What do you call me
behind my back, I wonder.

06:48.825 --> 06:53.703
Yeah. Can l get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.832
I call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

06:56.999 --> 07:02.129
-l'm cool with that. I surely am.
-l'll see you later, Keef.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.844
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.012
A Beresford maid serves with a smile.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.391
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.936
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.899
You know what l just heard?

07:23.067 --> 07:26.111
Christina? History after the 1 st.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.822
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.991
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.577
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.204
Wrong. lt means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

07:36.372 --> 07:41.376
-Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
-Ten hours and counting.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.794
Hey, Marisa, you here?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.130
Can l finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.716
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.178
All I'm saying is, it could be you.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.138
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.600
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.560
You know what l'm saying?

08:07.570 --> 08:11.364
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

08:11.949 --> 08:16.870
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

08:17.038 --> 08:21.082
Christina Howard's promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

08:21.250 --> 08:24.044
...with in-house personnel.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.506
-Perhaps one of our butlers.
-Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

08:27.673 --> 08:32.093
-Yes, Miss Kehoe?
-Can a maid apply?

08:32.261 --> 08:36.431
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

08:36.599 --> 08:40.101
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

08:40.269 --> 08:44.814
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

08:44.982 --> 08:48.026
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.403
Yeah, l guess he did.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.114
On to new business.

08:53.366 --> 08:58.662
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.290
He's back on the wagon,
so let's clear out the minibar.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.794
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 81 4.

09:05.962 --> 09:10.090
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.968
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.678
Housekeeping.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.055
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

09:17.223 --> 09:20.517
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.811
You son of a bitch!

09:22.979 --> 09:25.689
Let's make sure it.s
a smooth transition.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.733
The Guedj sisters are back.
We.ll track them on surveillance...

09:28.901 --> 09:32.821
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.741
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.618
She requested a park view...

09:38.786 --> 09:42.497
...and favors purple orchids
and lavender scents.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.667
Assemblyman chris Marshall
arrives today.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.294
He's gearing up his campaign...

09:47.461 --> 09:50.005
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference center...

09:50.172 --> 09:53.842
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.430
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accouterments.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.392
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.396
Careful, ladies, he's a full Monty.

10:09.233 --> 10:13.194
-l had no idea anyone was here.
-Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.030
No big deal.

10:15.197 --> 10:19.200
-And I do mean no big deal.
-No big deal.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.959
Lavender!

10:28.628 --> 10:31.504
-You're very creative, Marisa.
-Thank you, ma'am.

10:31.714 --> 10:36.051
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.807
-Sir, I need you to sign off on the--
-Damn!

10:42.975 --> 10:46.394
Oh, good Lord. Here, let me.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.147
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.691
Oh, God. Your hand's bleeding.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.571
Here. Squeeze tight.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.580
Damn. He's checked in.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.625
Quote, "Sentimental favorite
Chris Marshall...

11:08.793 --> 11:09.876
...blah, blah, blah...

11:10.044 --> 11:12.754
...son of late Senator
Graham Marshall, blah, blah...

11:12.922 --> 11:16.091
...is expected to run for his father's
seat in the next election."

11:16.258 --> 11:18.802
-End quote.
-Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.929
You don't need to see it. No.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.140
-Give it here.
-Fine. But l hadn't finished it yet.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.227
"Sentimental favorite
and playboy politico...

11:27.395 --> 11:30.730
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall...."
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.482
What, "playboy"?
That's a compliment.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.486
"Who called off his engagement
to uber babe Daniella Van Graas...

11:36.654 --> 11:39.906
...arrives in town solo."
Respectful, huh?

11:40.616 --> 11:44.244
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. lt's news. So what?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.663
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

11:46.831 --> 11:49.457
Yours. That's why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.918
-Every now and again it might be nice.
-Here.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.878
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.130
-Hello.
-My name is Lionel.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.631
-Lionel?
-l'm the floor butler.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.008
If there's anything you need,
please call me.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.012
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.265
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.852
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.730
-Can you look at me for a minute?
-What? l am looking at you.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.190
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.442
No, Jerry, we're not.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.695
See, this is when I wish your
old man were here to back me up.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.488
-What?
-l said, l wish your old man...

12:20.656 --> 12:23.575
-...were here to back me up.
-My father had no use for that man.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.911
Your father knew how
to use that man.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.122
-Where are you going?
-What?

12:29.290 --> 12:32.333
-That depends. Where are you going?
-Bathroom. Alone.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.586
-Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
-Thank you.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.880
Call me if you need anything.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.053
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.185
Thank you.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.700
Sir.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.662
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm so clumsy.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.332
-Happens to all of us. Here.
-Thank you.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.501
-Let me help you.
-Thank you.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.671
-Where do those go?
-Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.217
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.386
Here. Blood and Dolce:

13:26.847 --> 13:30.767
Thank you. Thank you.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.395
I mean, there are limits.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.235
You're so bad. You really are, Rach.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.071
Yes, just hold on a second.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.032
Thank you. Anything, I mean,
it's up and down.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.244
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.121
Yeah. No way.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.123
So l...

13:54.291 --> 13:59.963
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

14:00.464 --> 14:05.677
Of course, I added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.137
Fantastic, right?

14:08.722 --> 14:12.100
Eric will be furious.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.311
-That needs pressing.
-Okay.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.065
But let's not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.778
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.992
Listen, my darling, I'm going
to be late. I'll call you later, okay?

14:30.286 --> 14:31.661
Excuse me. Sorry.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.665
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.127
These two?

14:40.045 --> 14:44.257
Well, l just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.469
Could l ask you an enormous favor?

14:48.762 --> 14:53.683
I mean, l know this isn't your job,
and l'd never normally ask, but I'm so....

14:53.851 --> 14:57.061
-lt's okay.
-You're such a doll.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.273
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

15:00.441 --> 15:04.110
-The concierge usually does that.
-Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.654
Please. You look like
you're someone...

15:06.822 --> 15:09.824
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.162
-Okay.
-Thanks.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.832
Here. Thank you so much.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.084
-Okay.
-Oh, and sorry.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.254
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.506
-Right away.
-Thanks.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.342
Bye.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.094
Attention! Somebody's coming!

15:32.723 --> 15:35.224
-You think it's gonna rain?
-Maybe. lt's possible.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.768
-Hi, where's the fire?
-Nowhere.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.020
I just got sent on an errand.
I'm already late.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.481
-Get these pressed for me?
-Sure, in my spare time.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.483
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.859
-What?
-Can't be late for Ty!

15:53.202 --> 15:56.287
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, I'm gonna come over.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.791
I'm gonna go in your closet.
I'm gonna put it on for you.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.377
Wait. Hold on a sec.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.879
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

16:05.047 --> 16:07.382
-ln back to see if Carrie's here.
-Carrie's not here.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.217
So could you just step away?

16:09.385 --> 16:10.593
Away.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.721
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.392
Hi. Sorry. Okay, so you go first.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.812
No, you! No, you.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.605
Get out.

16:22.773 --> 16:26.234
-Get out.
-Excuse me, just a moment.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.528
You know what? l have customers,
so go on quick.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.906
Yeah. Then what?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.574
No, he didn't.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.910
-No, he didn't.
-Can l just ask you one question?

16:36.078 --> 16:40.957
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

16:41.125 --> 16:44.752
What? No, a maid.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.546
-l don't know.
-Yo.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.840
-You can't be back here.
-Leezette?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.591
What are you doing?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.261
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

16:53.429 --> 16:54.595
...and l'm in a rush...

16:54.763 --> 16:57.390
...l'd say you start serving
your low-end customers...

16:57.558 --> 16:59.475
...because that's
the reason you're here.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.437
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.064
In which case,
I'm sure your manager is.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.442
What do you say, ladies?
Am l right or am l right?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.902
-You're right.
-Oh, yes.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.450
-Sorry, Mom.
-Baby, where were you?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.743
Keef, do me a favor.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.661
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

17:18.829 --> 17:22.123
-l got you. Don't forget the bags.
-Thank you.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.583
Are you ready?

17:23.751 --> 17:26.753
-l'm not gonna have time to change.
-Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.672
No, Ma, we cannot be late, okay?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.466
-Come on.
-l was on time.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.761
Are they here yet?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.238
-Hello?
-Marisa?

17:54.406 --> 17:57.492
Yeah. Marcus. Yeah.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.243
No, I can't hear you.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.413
-When's Ty's speech again?
-l'll get it.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.832
In 20 minutes, at 4:00.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.543
-And you cannot be late.
-Well....

18:07.753 --> 18:09.295
Marcus!

18:10.255 --> 18:13.216
-You're just breaking up. What?
-l can.t be there. I'm in Miami.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.094
-Please tell me you're kidding.
-I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.513
Don't do this to me, Marcus.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.724
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.185
What am I supposed
to tell him this time?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.145
-This weekend is the holiday.
-l know.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.523
-He's counting on it.
-He.ll get over it.

18:28.690 --> 18:32.026
-l'll take him at Christmas, okay?
-Tell somebody who believes you.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.195
I gotta go.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.865
That shit.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.536
This fell out of your bag. Is it yours?

18:42.913 --> 18:45.414
Yeah, thanks.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.876
Management, huh?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.045
Que fancy.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.633
What?

18:56.426 --> 18:57.927
I'm not saying a word.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.097
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

19:02.766 --> 19:06.561
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.880
Richard Milhous Nixon...

19:36.633 --> 19:39.802
...was a man
of many contradictions.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.640
Even though
he is remembered in history...

19:44.808 --> 19:48.269
...as the only president
to ever resign...

19:52.149 --> 19:56.652
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

19:56.820 --> 20:01.115
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern--

20:01.283 --> 20:05.286
I mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.288
That's enough.

20:07.789 --> 20:12.126
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless....

20:13.128 --> 20:16.881
He was responsible for bombing...

20:17.049 --> 20:20.968
...for the violent bombing of....

20:22.429 --> 20:26.974
Richard Nixon was born in....

20:52.042 --> 20:54.168
Hey, baby.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.008
They were all laughing at me,
and then l lost my words.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.220
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.640
I never want to do that again, okay?

21:10.018 --> 21:12.687
You're going to do better next time.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.522
No.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.152
All right, we'll talk about it later...

21:20.320 --> 21:25.199
...because I got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

21:28.578 --> 21:32.081
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.169
Mom.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.756
Oh, papi.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.383
I'm sorry.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.055
Where's Dad?

21:50.225 --> 21:52.643
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.730
It was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.482
It's okay.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.653
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.416
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.752
I know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.920
-What's up, Frannie, Michelle?
-Good morning.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.257
-Hey, Ty, how are you?
-What's up, Ty?

22:26.136 --> 22:27.678
Lily?

22:27.846 --> 22:29.805
We're here.

22:29.973 --> 22:34.060
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

22:34.227 --> 22:36.103
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:36.271 --> 22:41.525
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

22:43.987 --> 22:47.281
-l'm on 22 if you need me, okay?
-Okay.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.117
So l'll see you at lunchtime.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.454
You all right?

22:55.415 --> 22:56.665
I'm cool.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.464
You know, I am really sorry
about all this.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.676
It's not your fault.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.432
-See you later. Thank you.
-Sure.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.979
What's with the face?

23:19.147 --> 23:22.483
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.985
-We come here every day.
-He'll have a ball.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.320
You said it.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.282
-You need to loosen up.
-l'm not interested.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.159
-Why are you stealing my tissues?
-l need them.

23:32.327 --> 23:36.997
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

23:37.165 --> 23:41.669
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.005
-The expression is "heels."
-Maybe for you.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.133
-l'm with you, girl.
-You only live once.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.718
-You know. Come on.
-No.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.389
Live it, girl.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.684
I'm living.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.980
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.944
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid l had yesterday?

24:07.112 --> 24:10.030
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, fantastic. l need another favor.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.949
I'm late for lunch,
otherwise l'd do it.

24:12.117 --> 24:16.078
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

24:16.246 --> 24:18.873
-Sure, l'll take care of it.
-Thank you. You're the best.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.583
Okay.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.877
-Who's she?
-She's the goddess.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.880
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.507
Yeah? Then why am I the one
wearing the uniform?

24:28.675 --> 24:31.093
What l meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

24:31.261 --> 24:34.180
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped--

24:34.347 --> 24:36.974
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.061
-What are you looking at?
-l meant the question.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.564
My God, is your mind always...

24:43.732 --> 24:45.941
...on the pepperoni?

24:46.109 --> 24:48.360
That's right, baby.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.916
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.585
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her--

25:04.753 --> 25:07.505
-And you're what?
-l'm working hard for the money.

25:07.672 --> 25:11.550
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.219
Yeah.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.097
What are you doing?

25:17.974 --> 25:21.602
-Dolce, nice.
-No, no, come on, get out of there.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.772
I'm just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.565
You're gonna get us in trouble.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.984
Hello, ladies.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.945
Leave that stuff alone. Come on.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.155
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.616
Feel this material.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.702
I mean, it's like butter.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.123
Oh, my God.

25:43.291 --> 25:46.210
This stuff is $5000.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.005
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

25:50.173 --> 25:51.340
Scotchgard.

25:51.508 --> 25:53.467
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.803
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

25:55.971 --> 25:57.972
And shoes too.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.474
Shoes. Size 9. Perfect.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.309
-l'm a 7 1/2.
-Which means you're an 8.

26:02.477 --> 26:05.479
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.774
That's it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

26:08.942 --> 26:10.317
Not until you try it on.

26:10.485 --> 26:12.486
I can't try on her clothes!

26:12.988 --> 26:17.116
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.285
Let's not let them hear us.

26:19.452 --> 26:20.452
Who, the clothes?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.079
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

26:22.247 --> 26:26.333
...when will you or l ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

26:26.501 --> 26:32.339
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.802
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

26:36.970 --> 26:40.681
Hey. I'm sewing on a button.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.267
What's the cook making for lunch?

26:43.435 --> 26:47.146
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.695
Where you going?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.947
Around. l'll be right back.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.409
-Stay close, okay?
-Okay.

27:00.910 --> 27:01.952
Rufus.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.538
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.040
-Where are you going?
-For a walk.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.792
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.045
-We should do a drive-by.
-A quick pit stop?

27:11.212 --> 27:12.713
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.382
-Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
-Sure thing.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.509
Do I look as stupid
as you think l am?

27:17.677 --> 27:20.387
No. I mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

27:20.555 --> 27:22.264
-Come on.
-Where are you going? No.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.391
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

27:24.559 --> 27:27.102
I have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

27:27.270 --> 27:31.315
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.067
He's not speaking until 1 :30.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.535
I know this offends your sense
of fairness, but I'd like to win.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.704
-You don't give up.
-No, of course not.

27:45.872 --> 27:48.916
That's why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

27:49.084 --> 27:52.544
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
"Hello," "goodbye," you're home free.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.922
Define "free."

27:56.424 --> 28:00.302
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.389
-l mean, l know that's a crazy idea.
-l want to walk my own dog.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.557
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.269
He's friendly.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.939
-His name is Rufus.
-Hey, Rufus.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.316
So, what are you listening to?

28:16.069 --> 28:20.781
-The Best of Bread.
-Best ofBread? Interesting.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.783
What's your name?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.829
-Ty.
-Nice to meet you, Ty. l'm Chris.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.914
I'm bald and no one in particular.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.249
I know who you are.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.127
Yeah? What do you know?

28:34.337 --> 28:36.338
I know that you're
the state assemblyman.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.882
I know you're thinking
of running for senator.

28:39.050 --> 28:42.428
I know your voting record and
your stand on environmental causes.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.138
Great.

28:44.305 --> 28:47.474
-Look, I hate to interrupt, but--
-Are you Republican?

28:48.685 --> 28:50.269
Yes.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.603
Why?

28:51.771 --> 28:53.564
Richard Nixon was Republican.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.982
So what?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.984
-He lied.
-So, what does that mean?

28:57.152 --> 28:58.652
Nothing.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.363
Who told you to ask
these questions?

29:01.823 --> 29:02.948
Nobody.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.826
What press are you affiliated with?

29:06.327 --> 29:07.369
I'm 1 0.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.288
Your parents?
Democrat or Republican?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.999
-What's the difference these days?
-l love this kid.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.042
Well, what's not to love?

29:14.377 --> 29:16.670
-Where you going?
-l'm gonna walk Rufus.

29:16.838 --> 29:20.507
What, are you writing a book?
In 1 0 minutes, okay?

29:20.675 --> 29:22.634
-One pee.
-lf Mom says okay, can l come?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.762
-What?
-lf my mom says okay, can I come?

29:24.929 --> 29:28.140
-Sure. Where's your mom?
-Back on 22. Park Suite.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.309
No, you know what, Chris?
You're in a hurry.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.812
-He doesn't have time.
-No, he's in a hurry. l'm fine.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.189
-You take him.
-What?

29:35.356 --> 29:37.357
I'll go up with you.
I forgot his ball anyway.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.860
I don't want to-- Wait!

29:43.573 --> 29:45.657
Hold on!

29:50.413 --> 29:52.247
Hi, honey. lt's Ty!

29:52.415 --> 29:54.458
What are you doing up here?

29:54.626 --> 29:55.667
Where's Mom?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.215
It's for you, ma'am.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.050
What are you talking about?
Ty, don't you--?

30:03.218 --> 30:06.553
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant gray dog named Rufus.

30:06.721 --> 30:10.432
And if you say okay,
I'm gonna go walk with him, okay?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.559
-Hello.
-Hi.

30:12.727 --> 30:16.772
Let's not forget. I'm a kid and l need
fresh air. Please, can l go, Mom?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.857
I'm Chris Marshall.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.734
Caroline...

30:21.653 --> 30:22.903
...you want your coat?

30:23.071 --> 30:25.864
-What?
-The weather can be so tricky here.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.908
Weren't you saying
what a beautiful day it was?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.743
Oh, you're going out?

30:29.911 --> 30:32.788
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

30:32.956 --> 30:35.249
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind....

30:35.416 --> 30:37.709
She doesn't have a husband.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.295
-l don't have a husband.
-l insist, then.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.297
-Come with us, if you're free.
-Yeah.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.424
-Come on, Mom.
-Here we go.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.385
I can't.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.264
-Put these on.
-The shoes are too big.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.766
Have a good time. Have fun.

30:53.601 --> 30:57.312
-Come on, Ty, let's go find Rufus.
-Come on, Mom.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.107
Mr. Marshall, John Bextrum,
hotel manager.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.441
This is fun.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.278
-So be cool, okay?
-Okay.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.405
What's this?

31:06.573 --> 31:08.615
If that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.285
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.579
-Really? l never got the message.
-Really?

31:13.746 --> 31:15.038
You said you'd take us to Niketown.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.624
Well, here, I'll go down with you.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.466
Beautiful ensemble.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.635
How does she keep it clean?

31:28.803 --> 31:30.012
Scotchgard?

31:30.179 --> 31:32.472
You think that's the new girlfriend?

31:32.849 --> 31:33.849
For tonight.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.478
Ladies, would you like to join us?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.230
Pig!

31:40.982 --> 31:42.149
Au revoir.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.817
Bye-Bye.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.652
Bye.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.701
Come on, Rufus, just pee
because l have stuff to do.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.538
-Pee! Lift your leg.
-Jerry Siegel, is that you?

31:56.706 --> 31:58.665
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.083
You know Victor Delgado.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.920
Victor, Jerry Siegel,
Chris Marshall's right-hand.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.632
-You groom also?
-That's good.

32:06.799 --> 32:10.677
I was showing Victor our new
building on 57th. Wanna join us?

32:10.845 --> 32:12.721
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
I've got--

32:12.889 --> 32:15.140
-l can see that.
-Well, l mean--

32:15.308 --> 32:17.392
Don't forget to scoop.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.023
Kill! Kill! Rufus! Kill!

32:23.191 --> 32:26.193
Let's go. You're gonna
have to hold it. Come on!

32:27.862 --> 32:30.238
Okay, l'll handle it.
Walk to the park.

32:30.406 --> 32:33.200
I'll get Rufus and Jerry,
and we'll catch up. Go ahead.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.370
Guys, there's nothing here.
Just an old friend and her son.

32:36.537 --> 32:39.289
-She got a name?
-Yeah, "Unidentified Old Friend."

32:40.041 --> 32:42.793
You give me this,
I'll give you 1 5 minutes...

32:42.961 --> 32:44.795
...inside the benefit,
Monday night.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.380
You'll get us in at the Met?

32:46.547 --> 32:47.923
-You got it.
-Open bar?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.884
-Don't push it.
-Thank you.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.887
Come on, Rufus.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.014
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

32:56.182 --> 32:58.225
A great time!
It was perfect timing.

32:58.393 --> 33:02.104
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

33:02.271 --> 33:05.232
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.901
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1 :30.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.321
I want you there at 1 :00, okay?
All right? Okay?

33:11.489 --> 33:13.782
Bye. l'm going to shower.

33:14.617 --> 33:17.828
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.122
-Wait up!
-Don't say anything. Just act--

33:22.542 --> 33:25.293
I couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.921
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.924
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.218
-Can l take him?
-Sure. Go ahead.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.095
-Be careful. He's strong.
-Come on.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.848
-Be careful and stay close.
-l will.

33:39.225 --> 33:40.892
Hang on!

33:43.980 --> 33:48.025
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.737
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

33:51.904 --> 33:52.988
It was bad.

33:53.156 --> 33:56.658
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

33:56.826 --> 33:59.327
I don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

33:59.495 --> 34:02.998
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

34:03.166 --> 34:06.126
I always get nervous
before l go on.

34:06.502 --> 34:09.463
-Really?
-Yeah.

34:09.964 --> 34:13.633
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.927
-Mr. Marshall?
-Look at the dogs.

34:16.095 --> 34:19.639
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.808
Yeah, to get Rufus.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.393
-ls that Rufus?
-That's him.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.978
He's beautiful.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.813
-Can l?
-Sure.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.440
-Hey, buddy!
-Can l have him?

34:28.608 --> 34:30.650
-Okay.
-Thank you.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.403
-Ma, can I go play?
-Yeah, go ahead.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.572
This is for you.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.992
-Thank you.
-Bye. Let's go.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.413
It's from my nanny.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.415
Do you want to sit down?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.502
-Sure.
-Over here.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.344
Cool, I won't get dirty.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.765
Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face.
Right there.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.155
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.450
Thanks. I'm kind of crazy
about him.

35:20.618 --> 35:25.205
I've never met a 1 0-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.543
Yeah, l know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

35:29.710 --> 35:32.587
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.798
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.716
-You're kidding!
-No.

35:36.884 --> 35:41.138
I'm waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, l'm learning a lot.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.391
Well, l think it's great.

35:44.892 --> 35:47.519
-You do?
-l do.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.357
Guess what? I threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

35:52.525 --> 35:55.902
-Really?
-Yeah. I'm gonna go do it again.

35:56.362 --> 36:00.282
So how long are you
in town for?

36:02.368 --> 36:03.952
I'm not sure.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.912
You always stay at the Beresford?

36:08.082 --> 36:11.084
Sometimes I feel like I live there.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.753
So, what brings you here?

36:14.797 --> 36:17.841
-Work.
-What do you do?

36:20.386 --> 36:23.805
-Oh, my God! 1 1 :00, by the tree.
-What?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.974
Check it, 1 1 :00.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.809
That's Eddie Yatter.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.021
-What does he want?
-He's paparazzi. I can't shake him.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.607
He works for Blanton Maddox...

36:33.774 --> 36:36.693
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

36:36.861 --> 36:41.698
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that I've broken up with--

36:41.866 --> 36:44.367
Your supermodel fiancee?

36:44.535 --> 36:46.119
Oh, God! Ty!

36:46.287 --> 36:48.413
-What?
-Come on!

36:49.207 --> 36:52.125
-l just realized that you--
-Excuse me?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.794
-Sorry, it's just that my face is--
-What?

36:54.962 --> 36:57.589
-What's wrong with your face?
-lt's stuck to your--

36:57.757 --> 36:59.299
What's that?

36:59.467 --> 37:04.137
-Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
-Here, let me. lt's okay.

37:04.388 --> 37:07.641
Oh, my God! Did I get
anything on it? Is it okay?

37:07.808 --> 37:09.517
It's perfect.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.855
-So....
-Okay.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.316
Don't believe everything you read.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.319
-Any of it true?
-No.

37:19.487 --> 37:24.407
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.701
It's complicated.

37:27.161 --> 37:30.413
I want to show you something.
Follow me.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.046
Oh, God.

37:38.214 --> 37:42.759
-Let me help you.
-l got it. lt's fine. l'm good.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.929
Don't worry about me.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.181
Look at that.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.728
It's like two different worlds.

37:54.188 --> 37:57.232
-lnteresting perspective, huh?
-Yeah.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.277
And l'd like to point out
it's paparazzi-free.

38:01.696 --> 38:05.240
You know when l come here most
is when l have to make a speech...

38:05.408 --> 38:06.741
...and l get nervous.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.285
-You get nervous?
-Sure.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.452
See that?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.706
Sometimes when I have
to stand up in front of people...

38:12.873 --> 38:16.751
...my heart kind of races,
and l can't remember my words.

38:16.919 --> 38:20.380
-Same here. I know.
-Really? Same with you?

38:20.548 --> 38:23.758
Wow. Well, in my business,
it's not a good thing.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.803
-What do you do?
-What do I do?

38:27.388 --> 38:29.222
I want to show you something.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.977
I hold on to this.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.938
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

38:37.106 --> 38:38.857
It was.
I had to find something...

38:39.025 --> 38:41.526
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.403
Like a....

38:43.571 --> 38:46.740
-Like a lightning rod?
-Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.950
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.244
And then what's left is....

38:51.412 --> 38:52.912
Your speech.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.915
Yeah, a smooth,
and l'd like to think...

38:56.083 --> 38:58.752
...very compelling speech.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.589
Some of the best speakers
in history...

39:03.841 --> 39:05.633
...a paper clip.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.386
Let me see, Henry Kissinger.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.056
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.683
No, he wasn't, was he?

39:15.978 --> 39:19.397
Well, imagine what he would've
been like without the:

39:20.441 --> 39:23.276
-He would've really sucked.
-He would've what?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.111
-Really sucked.
-Right.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.032
So maybe you'll try again?

39:31.452 --> 39:33.870
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

39:35.915 --> 39:39.209
-Let's go see penguins.
-Five minutes.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.797
-You're a bad influence.
-l am?

39:43.964 --> 39:45.465
Hurry up!

39:52.223 --> 39:53.640
Look at this guy go.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.852
They're so funny.

39:58.020 --> 40:01.523
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

40:01.690 --> 40:05.026
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

40:05.194 --> 40:09.781
It's a black-tie.
It's a $2500-a-plate dinner.

40:09.949 --> 40:14.077
-Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
-$2500 a plate.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.664
-l hope you get to keep the plate.
-You can if you want.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.666
What is it for?

40:19.834 --> 40:23.002
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something l support.

40:23.170 --> 40:26.172
It's a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

40:26.340 --> 40:30.677
It's not quite as boring as it sounds.
I don't know, are you interested?

40:31.846 --> 40:36.015
Wait a minute. lsn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

40:36.225 --> 40:37.600
Yes, it is.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.853
I don't get it.
Why would you go?

40:40.020 --> 40:44.524
I go because-- l go--
It's exposure.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.069
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

40:48.237 --> 40:51.364
Well, l kind of
have to expose myself.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.701
-When you put it that way--
-l didn't. You put it that way.

40:55.327 --> 40:57.495
I don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

40:57.663 --> 41:00.874
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.626
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.379
You really want me
to tell you what l think?

41:06.547 --> 41:11.217
If Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

41:11.385 --> 41:14.888
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

41:15.055 --> 41:17.974
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

41:18.559 --> 41:22.020
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.689
Monday...

41:24.857 --> 41:26.900
...l'm busy. Sorry.

41:27.234 --> 41:31.613
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

41:31.864 --> 41:33.907
It's complicated.

41:34.825 --> 41:38.495
Which reminds me, I gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

41:38.662 --> 41:42.123
-We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
-Do we have to?

41:44.001 --> 41:46.419
-l gotta get back.
-Caroline.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.798
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.009
Except for Yatter.

41:54.261 --> 41:58.056
It was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.064
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.982
Here, Ty....

42:08.943 --> 42:12.070
-Don't use them all on one speech.
-l won't.

42:13.113 --> 42:16.699
-Keep up the good voting record.
-l'll do my best.

42:22.414 --> 42:24.832
"It's complicated."
What kind of answer is that?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.292
Honest.

42:26.460 --> 42:30.129
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

42:30.297 --> 42:34.092
Look, what am I supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

42:34.260 --> 42:35.343
Get real!

42:35.511 --> 42:38.471
-He thinks I'm a guest here.
-All right. All right.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.140
But just tell me what he was like.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.477
Sexy eyes.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.646
And nice lips.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.816
What about the hands?
Were they big?

42:55.197 --> 42:58.825
-They were perfect.
-Perfect works.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.743
-Marisa!
-Who? What?

43:00.911 --> 43:04.330
-Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
-Oh, my God, it's Paula!

43:15.676 --> 43:17.885
What are you doing?

43:18.053 --> 43:20.805
I just....
I spilled something on my apron...

43:20.973 --> 43:24.183
...so l was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

43:24.351 --> 43:27.020
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.486
Oh, shit!

43:38.949 --> 43:42.452
Look who's here.
Let's review the last hour, okay?

43:42.620 --> 43:46.456
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.751
-You got a pen that works?
-Sure. Here you go.

43:49.918 --> 43:52.879
-Anything else I can do for you?
-No, that's good, thanks.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.548
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.301
Her name is Caroline.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.470
-Can you handle that for me?
-Certainly.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.556
-Thank you.
-Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

44:03.724 --> 44:06.225
Someone l met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

44:06.393 --> 44:08.728
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

44:08.896 --> 44:12.982
But l was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

44:13.150 --> 44:16.653
-...to read while fighting Nazis.
-l thought your mother was in Florida.

44:16.820 --> 44:20.239
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

44:20.407 --> 44:22.450
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or--?

44:22.618 --> 44:23.618
Rufus.

44:23.786 --> 44:27.038
Sure, okay, great.
Can l talk to you for a second?

44:27.206 --> 44:30.583
I want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

44:30.751 --> 44:32.919
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

44:33.087 --> 44:34.504
Thanks. Good job.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.766
Come in, Miss Ventura.

44:49.770 --> 44:53.439
I assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

44:53.607 --> 44:55.858
I think so. Yes, sir.

44:56.819 --> 45:01.114
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

45:04.410 --> 45:05.785
Location?

45:06.120 --> 45:09.288
Loyalty and trust.

45:09.540 --> 45:13.042
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

45:13.210 --> 45:14.752
I would. Yes, sir.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.757
Miss Burns agrees.

45:19.925 --> 45:22.051
And she's urged me
to consider you.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.054
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

45:25.222 --> 45:28.224
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.645
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

45:32.813 --> 45:35.189
...and your mother's maiden name.

45:35.357 --> 45:39.736
If you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

45:39.903 --> 45:44.157
Normally, you'd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler, but--

45:44.324 --> 45:47.744
-Given the circumstances--
-Due to overbooking, understaffing...

45:47.911 --> 45:50.163
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

45:50.330 --> 45:53.541
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

45:53.709 --> 45:56.127
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

45:56.295 --> 45:59.088
...and fulfill each requirement
for every station.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.008
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

46:02.176 --> 46:06.763
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.348
So jump.

46:13.103 --> 46:16.022
Steph, where are you?
I know you're in here.

46:17.024 --> 46:20.276
-Don't tell me you're busted.
-No, you are.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.029
You know what?
You had no right!

46:23.197 --> 46:24.530
What are you talking about?

46:24.865 --> 46:26.866
You filled out
an application for me?

46:28.035 --> 46:30.870
-They're considering you.
-Do you know what you've done?

46:31.038 --> 46:33.873
-l did you a favor.
-No. If you wanna do me a favor...

46:34.041 --> 46:36.501
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

46:36.668 --> 46:39.921
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

46:40.088 --> 46:41.631
...and what ideas you got.

46:41.799 --> 46:45.218
This morning, l'm having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

46:45.385 --> 46:47.762
...and l ask her.
I go, "Marisa got a shot?"

46:47.930 --> 46:50.848
She goes, "Marisa who?"
I go, "Marisa Ventura. She's applied."

46:51.016 --> 46:54.185
She goes, "lf she applied,
I'd slip it to the top of the pile."

46:54.353 --> 46:57.814
So l just act real nonchalantlike
and l go, "Are you sure?"

46:57.981 --> 47:00.650
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

47:00.818 --> 47:05.363
"Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever."

47:05.531 --> 47:08.407
Imagine my shock and dismay.

47:08.575 --> 47:10.451
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

47:10.619 --> 47:14.330
Then l figured maybe you were
too chickenshit, so l did it myself.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.082
If they took you,
you'd be happy.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.669
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

47:19.837 --> 47:22.880
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.049
Don't waste them.

47:39.982 --> 47:42.191
What we did today was wrong.

47:42.359 --> 47:45.278
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.405
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

47:47.573 --> 47:49.615
Letting someone believe
something's true when it's not...

47:49.783 --> 47:51.576
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

47:51.743 --> 47:55.454
I let him think l was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. I'm the maid.

47:55.622 --> 47:59.500
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't think he's after your money.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.879
I can't believe you just said that!

48:03.964 --> 48:07.466
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

48:32.117 --> 48:33.701
Good job.

48:34.286 --> 48:38.080
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

48:38.582 --> 48:41.000
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

48:44.838 --> 48:46.213
Can l borrow this?

48:46.381 --> 48:48.174
-Of course.
-Thank you.

48:48.342 --> 48:49.884
Baby, bye.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.011
And remember,
all security lDs...

48:52.179 --> 48:54.847
...will need to be rephotographed
starting next week.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.475
I think that's all.
Thank you very much.

48:57.643 --> 49:00.561
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.196
-Have you seen this?
-No. What?

49:10.364 --> 49:12.198
Well, let me show you.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.908
Give me this.

49:14.493 --> 49:17.119
Yeah. So?

49:17.287 --> 49:20.790
What do you mean, "so"? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

49:20.958 --> 49:23.709
I hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell it's you.

49:23.877 --> 49:27.046
-Don't worry about it.
-lt's the front page of the paper today.

49:27.214 --> 49:31.050
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.302
Do you understand
this could be bad?

49:33.470 --> 49:36.597
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.188
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.440
-Can l steal him away for a second?
-Sure.

49:46.608 --> 49:49.443
-Let me steal you away.
-Excuse me.

49:50.070 --> 49:52.405
-l want to talk to you.
-What's the problem?

49:52.906 --> 49:55.491
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

49:55.659 --> 49:58.828
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.081
I'm getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

50:02.249 --> 50:05.418
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

50:05.585 --> 50:08.421
...who the kid is. A kid!

50:10.007 --> 50:13.592
Just when I get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.969
Thanks.

50:15.137 --> 50:19.098
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

50:25.355 --> 50:31.277
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

50:31.445 --> 50:34.655
...and release.
Let's try that again.

50:34.823 --> 50:39.285
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

50:39.453 --> 50:43.122
-...and relax.
-Sorry, l'll come back.

50:44.249 --> 50:46.333
That's okay.
You can work around us.

50:46.501 --> 50:49.712
We could use some more towels,
por favor. Rapido.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.090
Squeezing the circle tighter...

50:53.258 --> 50:56.135
...and tighter and tighter.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.554
Radiating from the pelvis.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.807
Good. Breathe.

51:01.975 --> 51:03.768
Exhale.

51:03.935 --> 51:05.561
Are you all right?

51:06.354 --> 51:10.191
Twinkles, is it Eric?
I knew it.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.862
He hasn't called once.

51:15.030 --> 51:17.782
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

51:18.116 --> 51:23.746
So last night I called him, and--
Rach, he was with....

51:23.914 --> 51:27.083
I can't. lt's like cheap wine.

51:27.250 --> 51:30.503
-Shall we do some band work, ladies?
-Go on, l'm listening.

51:30.670 --> 51:33.464
-l heard her in the background.
-The cheap wine?

51:33.632 --> 51:37.093
His ex, in midlaugh.

51:37.344 --> 51:38.677
Butler service, Miss Lane.

51:39.888 --> 51:43.182
I have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.518
Christopher Marshall?

51:45.685 --> 51:48.104
As in, Christopher Marshall?

51:49.272 --> 51:52.358
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

51:52.526 --> 51:54.860
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

51:55.028 --> 51:57.530
...l placed in your room yesterday.

51:57.697 --> 52:00.407
-We're through. Thank you.
-ln my room?

52:00.575 --> 52:02.785
-l have to charge the full hour.
-Yesterday.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.036
-Fine.
-For lunch?

52:04.204 --> 52:05.704
-For two.
-Get out!

52:05.872 --> 52:07.706
-Where?
-ln his suite.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.376
This is a miracle.

52:11.586 --> 52:15.381
-Shall I give him an answer?
-Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

52:15.549 --> 52:18.175
-1 p.m.
-She'll be there. Thank you.

52:18.343 --> 52:19.885
When did this go down?

52:20.053 --> 52:23.180
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.100
I thought we had a moment.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.352
"Can you steal away an hour,
please?"

52:28.520 --> 52:32.731
-You think he saw you in the hall?
-Who cares? What should l wear?

52:32.899 --> 52:34.900
You look good in anything.

52:35.068 --> 52:37.194
But l didn't bring a thing!

52:37.362 --> 52:38.571
Let's see.

52:42.325 --> 52:45.703
Maria, thank goodness.
I need a favor. It's urgent.

52:45.871 --> 52:49.206
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

52:49.374 --> 52:52.209
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. It's just--

52:52.377 --> 52:56.881
Actually, they're still in the closet.
I thought you might want a second look.

52:57.424 --> 53:00.467
You are so good.
Thank God!

53:00.635 --> 53:04.013
-You should be a personal assistant.
-She's a maid.

53:04.181 --> 53:09.101
-So are they, with better titles.
-Actually, l'm up for a position.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.061
What do you think?

53:11.563 --> 53:13.606
Dolce coat, Gucci pants...

53:13.773 --> 53:16.609
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

53:16.776 --> 53:18.986
They're both divine!
Let's see.

53:19.154 --> 53:21.947
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

53:22.115 --> 53:24.742
...colored bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

53:25.076 --> 53:28.704
-Maria?
-She barely speaks English.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.791
-What?
-Excuse me?

53:32.959 --> 53:35.878
Maria, what do you think?

53:36.796 --> 53:38.964
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

53:39.132 --> 53:41.508
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

53:41.676 --> 53:44.053
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.805
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
It sends the wrong message.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.641
Like you're going someplace.

53:48.808 --> 53:52.770
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, colored-bra thing...

53:52.938 --> 53:58.025
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

53:59.819 --> 54:02.196
You want to make him work for it.

54:02.572 --> 54:05.324
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

54:05.492 --> 54:07.159
Thank you, Maria.

54:07.327 --> 54:11.497
I have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

54:13.166 --> 54:15.751
Excuse me. Sorry.

54:18.171 --> 54:19.922
Yes, that's it.

54:20.090 --> 54:23.759
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.558
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

54:31.726 --> 54:34.979
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.576
Butler service, Mr. Marshall.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.036
Come on in.

54:51.204 --> 54:54.039
Rufus, it's okay.
Thank you.

55:31.786 --> 55:35.039
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

55:35.206 --> 55:37.833
-Make a perfect triangle.
-Yes, sir.

55:48.636 --> 55:50.637
Hold on, I'm coming.

55:54.851 --> 55:58.437
You're an animal lover too!
So am l.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.274
I just can't get enough of them.

56:03.610 --> 56:07.321
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch a deux. Lovely!

56:08.448 --> 56:12.451
I just knew that we made
a connection at the...

56:12.619 --> 56:15.120
...Feathered Friends Tournament.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.084
Look!

56:22.295 --> 56:24.963
How sweet of you to remember.

56:26.132 --> 56:30.010
But l hope you didn't think
I needed reminding.

56:32.472 --> 56:35.307
Teddy Parrish sends you his best.

56:35.475 --> 56:36.642
Oh, Teddy.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.019
Right. Yeah.

56:39.729 --> 56:40.729
How is Teddy?

56:40.897 --> 56:43.565
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

56:43.733 --> 56:45.651
Excuse me,
I gotta check on something.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.569
Of course.

56:51.366 --> 56:54.368
Who is that over there?

56:54.994 --> 56:56.954
Caroline Lane.

56:58.373 --> 57:00.958
No. No, it's not her.

57:01.126 --> 57:02.668
-lt's not her?
-No.

57:04.462 --> 57:06.213
The Maddox thing.

57:07.340 --> 57:10.175
-Are you going?
-Of course.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.971
You know who l can't figure out
where l know them from?

57:14.139 --> 57:16.098
The woman visiting you
the other day...

57:16.266 --> 57:20.185
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 1 0.

57:20.353 --> 57:24.022
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

57:24.357 --> 57:28.694
She's premenopausal,
but don't tell her I said so.

57:29.612 --> 57:32.823
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

57:32.991 --> 57:35.993
Yes. Yes, l am.

57:37.203 --> 57:38.495
Good.

57:38.663 --> 57:41.874
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

57:53.052 --> 57:55.596
This salmon is perfect.

57:55.889 --> 58:00.225
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

58:00.393 --> 58:01.935
Thank you.

58:02.103 --> 58:04.563
Make sure you tuck it in tightly.

58:05.064 --> 58:08.567
She's about 5'6", dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.569
What the hell happened?

58:10.737 --> 58:13.947
-l'm sorry, sir.
-Don't be sorry. Just find her.

58:14.115 --> 58:16.700
Chris, l loved your quote
in The Times.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.702
Please!

58:30.423 --> 58:34.092
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. It's worth zillions.

58:34.427 --> 58:38.013
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.390
-Thank you so much.
-Really?

58:40.558 --> 58:42.476
Rufus, come here.

58:42.644 --> 58:43.977
Thank you.

58:44.187 --> 58:45.395
Sit. Sit.

58:45.563 --> 58:49.024
Maria, could l have a little water,
please?

58:49.609 --> 58:52.277
-Good boy.
-Such a sweet dog.

58:52.445 --> 58:53.445
Allow me.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.949
-That will be all.
-You know Nettie Rothford.

58:57.116 --> 58:58.367
Sure.

58:58.576 --> 59:00.452
She and I virtually grew up together.

59:00.620 --> 59:04.164
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

59:09.629 --> 59:11.630
-Right there.
-Good evening.

59:11.798 --> 59:14.132
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

59:14.300 --> 59:17.803
-l don't know. Was it?
-You tell me.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.596
Nice lunch?

59:20.723 --> 59:22.933
All right, what's up, mystery man?

59:23.101 --> 59:25.894
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

59:26.062 --> 59:29.815
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

59:29.983 --> 59:30.983
Thousands.

59:31.150 --> 59:35.028
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

59:35.196 --> 59:38.782
You know I'm beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

59:40.159 --> 59:45.330
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.839
You dirty old man.

59:56.551 --> 59:59.344
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

59:59.804 --> 1:00:03.015
About the silver soap dishes....

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:05.017
Rach, darling, I'll just be a sec.

1:00:05.184 --> 1:00:08.312
-Hi, I'm Caroline Lane--
-ln the Park Suite, yes.

1:00:08.479 --> 1:00:11.732
-l called about a ticket to the--
-Benefit. Monday night.

1:00:11.899 --> 1:00:16.528
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:19.239
Fantastic! And how much will that be?

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:21.575
-Three thousand dollars.
-What?

1:00:21.743 --> 1:00:24.286
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:26.496
Singles are always harder to place.

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:30.834
Well, l mean what is it?
Is it on the lnternet l'm an ex-couple?

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:33.545
I mean, does the whole hotel know?

1:00:33.713 --> 1:00:37.883
Is there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
"Unmarried, unclean"?

1:00:38.051 --> 1:00:42.095
Do I bear the scarlet letter? I'm....

1:00:42.263 --> 1:00:43.263
I'm....

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:46.391
I'm just....
Sorry. l....

1:00:46.559 --> 1:00:48.435
I'm better now.

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:51.021
Just charge it to my room.

1:00:51.189 --> 1:00:52.481
Yes, ma'am.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:55.567
Come on, Rach. Ghastly man!

1:00:55.735 --> 1:00:58.236
I am terrified to ask
what that was about.

1:00:58.404 --> 1:01:00.614
I think, being dumped.

1:01:00.782 --> 1:01:03.909
-Can l get your autograph?
-Amber? Is that your name?

1:01:04.077 --> 1:01:06.286
-Amber's your name.
-How you doing?

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:10.374
Get in the car! Get in the car!

1:01:11.709 --> 1:01:15.128
-Did she see us?
-Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

1:01:15.296 --> 1:01:17.339
-lt's fine.
-How did this happen?

1:01:17.507 --> 1:01:19.675
I think she's very attractive.

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:22.928
I had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.597
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:27.849
That woman wasn't
the woman l wanted.

1:01:28.017 --> 1:01:31.061
I don't know what to say.
I talked to the hotel manager.

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:34.898
That's the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:37.401
Wait. There she is.

1:01:37.777 --> 1:01:39.736
That's her. Cordell, pull over.

1:01:44.117 --> 1:01:47.160
-Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
-Hey, Chris!

1:01:47.328 --> 1:01:49.871
-Hey. How's it going, Ty?
-Okay.

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:51.373
-How you doing?
-Good.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:55.544
You want to hear something strange?
I invited you to lunch, and you came...

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:56.962
...only it wasn't you.

1:01:57.463 --> 1:01:59.506
So, what happened?

1:01:59.674 --> 1:02:04.261
-l don't know what you mean.
-Are you still staying at the Beresford?

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:08.432
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

1:02:08.599 --> 1:02:11.309
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

1:02:11.477 --> 1:02:14.521
-We can drop you at the Upper East?
-Yeah, Mom!

1:02:14.689 --> 1:02:19.192
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.987
-So how do l get ahold of you?
-Her cell's 9-1 -7--

1:02:22.655 --> 1:02:24.322
How about l call you?

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:27.659
If you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

1:02:27.827 --> 1:02:30.620
That's my card.
What's your last name, hon?

1:02:30.788 --> 1:02:33.290
-Ventura. What's yours?
-Spanish?

1:02:33.458 --> 1:02:36.793
-Jerry Spanish?
-No, Siegel. We have to go.

1:02:36.961 --> 1:02:39.504
-So do we.
-Use that number. Call anytime.

1:02:39.672 --> 1:02:41.006
-All right.
-Don't be shy.

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:45.302
-You're late. You have to give a speech.
-ln the Bronx?

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:47.512
-On what?
-Housing projects.

1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:48.680
Really?

1:02:49.432 --> 1:02:52.517
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

1:02:52.685 --> 1:02:54.936
No, I'm just gonna
take the press up there...

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:57.397
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

1:02:58.524 --> 1:03:01.276
-lnteresting.
-Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:03.320
-Bye.
-What are you not saying?

1:03:03.488 --> 1:03:05.697
-Nothing.
-Tell me.

1:03:08.701 --> 1:03:11.745
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

1:03:11.913 --> 1:03:15.707
...and then you wouldn't have to make
up speeches and memorize them.

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:19.211
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

1:03:19.378 --> 1:03:21.880
And how would you know? l mean....

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:24.591
Because I grew up there.

1:03:24.759 --> 1:03:27.761
I lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

1:03:27.929 --> 1:03:29.888
Bye.

1:03:32.475 --> 1:03:35.101
Okay, let's go. Come on.

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:38.980
-Chris!
-What?

1:03:39.148 --> 1:03:43.443
Shall we? Okay? Let's go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:46.822
Who the hell is she?

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:52.911
I'll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone I've met. And she isn't a phony.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:57.582
I'll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

1:03:57.750 --> 1:04:01.878
I swear to God, I'll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

1:04:04.257 --> 1:04:06.091
Deal?

1:04:06.592 --> 1:04:08.802
Deal. All right, sure. Okay.

1:04:16.435 --> 1:04:17.936
Okay, get in.

1:04:22.817 --> 1:04:25.861
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

1:04:26.028 --> 1:04:28.321
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

1:04:28.489 --> 1:04:31.241
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:33.618
And no Chris Marshall.

1:04:33.786 --> 1:04:37.038
-lt's not like you're breaking some law.
-Hey, l mean it.

1:04:37.206 --> 1:04:38.582
If you see him....

1:04:38.749 --> 1:04:43.545
-l'll make like a baby and head out first.
-Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:46.590
-Good night, Ma.
-Bye, baby.

1:04:52.013 --> 1:04:53.388
Heads up!

1:04:53.556 --> 1:04:56.683
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

1:04:56.851 --> 1:05:00.687
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese....

1:05:00.855 --> 1:05:02.480
Oh, my God. Hide me.

1:05:03.274 --> 1:05:06.401
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:08.778
So we'll put them in the Dior Suite.

1:05:08.946 --> 1:05:10.447
Yes, sir?

1:05:10.615 --> 1:05:12.490
-They're in the hall.
-What are they doing?

1:05:12.658 --> 1:05:15.327
-He's got something in his hands.
-Does it look serious?

1:05:15.494 --> 1:05:17.370
Calm down, it's just a letter.

1:05:17.538 --> 1:05:19.539
-Find that girl.
-Certainly.

1:05:19.707 --> 1:05:20.707
-He's coming.
-Be cool.

1:05:20.875 --> 1:05:24.336
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

1:05:24.503 --> 1:05:26.463
Thank you very much. That will be all.

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:44.773
Now....

1:05:44.941 --> 1:05:48.485
Are you truly interested
in management?

1:05:48.653 --> 1:05:51.029
Yes, very much, sir.

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:56.826
Then l suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

1:05:56.994 --> 1:06:02.040
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:04.834
At least until you're a manager.

1:06:05.294 --> 1:06:07.337
Then you can make your own rules.

1:06:08.047 --> 1:06:10.048
I'll make sure your shift is covered.

1:06:26.065 --> 1:06:27.732
-Mari.
-What happened?

1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:31.569
-You can still be a manager, right?
-Yeah, if l break it off with Chris.

1:06:31.737 --> 1:06:34.948
Break what off? No offense,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

1:06:35.116 --> 1:06:36.783
You don't get it. None of you.

1:06:36.951 --> 1:06:39.035
There was something
different about him.

1:06:39.203 --> 1:06:40.453
Yeah, it's called money.

1:06:40.621 --> 1:06:42.622
-No, it's called--
-Don't say, "love."

1:06:42.790 --> 1:06:44.791
-Don't let her say it.
-She's going to.

1:06:44.959 --> 1:06:47.002
We connected, you know....

1:06:47.169 --> 1:06:50.463
-l felt it. Ty felt it too.
-Snap out of it, all right?

1:06:50.631 --> 1:06:53.425
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

1:06:53.592 --> 1:06:55.885
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

1:06:56.053 --> 1:06:59.055
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

1:06:59.223 --> 1:07:01.433
-l hear you.
-Me too.

1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:03.184
I don't know.

1:07:03.352 --> 1:07:06.396
Come on, Maris, you....

1:07:06.564 --> 1:07:08.523
You could be manager!

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:11.484
Think of it, girl. One of us...

1:07:11.652 --> 1:07:13.653
...out there!

1:07:13.821 --> 1:07:15.280
In a blazer.

1:07:15.448 --> 1:07:17.532
Yeah.

1:07:18.492 --> 1:07:20.702
I don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:24.581
-Honey, look, it's not what you got.
-Baby, it's who you know.

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:27.459
-And what they got.
-You got it?

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:30.920
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us--

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:33.673
Raises!

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.717
All right, Ty, focus.

1:08:59.885 --> 1:09:01.344
Eyes forward.

1:09:01.512 --> 1:09:04.514
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston....

1:09:04.682 --> 1:09:07.392
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than l'll see in 1 0 lifetimes.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:11.271
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll....

1:09:11.438 --> 1:09:14.774
Be put up for adoption
while my mom....

1:09:16.569 --> 1:09:18.444
-Rots in prison!
-Excellent.

1:09:23.117 --> 1:09:24.868
-You want to say hi to Harry?
-Harry.

1:09:25.035 --> 1:09:27.120
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

1:09:27.288 --> 1:09:28.621
Just your support, Harry.

1:09:28.789 --> 1:09:30.999
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:33.209
-Let's wait on that.
-l'm calling Lorne.

1:09:33.377 --> 1:09:35.545
-lt's nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.474
-There they are. See them?
-l see them.

1:09:48.642 --> 1:09:52.228
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

1:09:52.396 --> 1:09:53.938
Just go and get it over with.

1:09:54.106 --> 1:09:57.692
-ls she here?
-She'll be here. She'll be here.

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:02.280
-Have fun, Ma.
-Thanks.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:06.826
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

1:10:06.994 --> 1:10:08.328
Oh, God.

1:10:08.495 --> 1:10:10.747
I can't breathe.

1:10:11.373 --> 1:10:13.917
What am I doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

1:10:14.084 --> 1:10:16.711
No, honey.
It's more like a dream, you know?

1:10:16.879 --> 1:10:19.130
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

1:10:19.298 --> 1:10:22.175
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:24.302
Tonight, the maid is a lie.

1:10:24.470 --> 1:10:28.765
And this, this is who you really are.

1:10:53.165 --> 1:10:54.374
What do you think?

1:10:54.541 --> 1:10:57.126
I think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

1:10:57.836 --> 1:10:59.045
-Let's get together.
-Good.

1:10:59.213 --> 1:11:02.715
Excuse me. I think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to....

1:11:02.883 --> 1:11:05.343
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

1:11:05.511 --> 1:11:09.555
Lovely of you,
but I don't think l'll be in town.

1:11:09.723 --> 1:11:11.641
I'm gonna bring him over here.

1:11:11.809 --> 1:11:14.185
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

1:11:14.353 --> 1:11:17.522
-She'll be here. She'll be here.
-She'd better be, Jerry.

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:57.228
You're beautiful.

1:11:58.439 --> 1:12:00.690
So are you.

1:12:05.446 --> 1:12:07.739
Thank you for being here.

1:12:10.576 --> 1:12:13.703
I only came to tell you that this...

1:12:13.871 --> 1:12:16.914
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

1:12:17.082 --> 1:12:18.708
It just can't.

1:12:20.044 --> 1:12:22.920
Well, then, you should've
worn a different dress.

1:12:28.010 --> 1:12:29.927
Want to dance?

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:56.788
You have to listen.
I know you're used to getting your way.

1:12:56.955 --> 1:12:59.332
Yeah, until l met you.

1:13:01.168 --> 1:13:04.253
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

1:13:04.421 --> 1:13:07.965
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

1:13:08.133 --> 1:13:10.802
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

1:13:10.969 --> 1:13:13.096
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

1:13:13.263 --> 1:13:15.640
-Jerry. l'm here--
-l'll take over. l know.

1:13:18.936 --> 1:13:21.813
-Oh, Chris. Hi.
-Hello.

1:13:23.399 --> 1:13:27.485
-What a night. I mean, who isn't here?
-Right.

1:13:28.070 --> 1:13:32.073
Do I need to know something
that I don't know already?

1:13:32.991 --> 1:13:36.744
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

1:13:36.912 --> 1:13:39.122
I like a good mystery, you know.

1:13:39.289 --> 1:13:41.916
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

1:13:42.084 --> 1:13:43.584
I'm not his girlfriend.

1:13:43.752 --> 1:13:46.295
Well, whatever.
I just need him focused.

1:13:46.463 --> 1:13:48.214
-Sorry about that.
-Not at all.

1:13:48.382 --> 1:13:50.049
-May I cut in?
-You certainly may.

1:13:50.217 --> 1:13:54.303
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

1:13:54.471 --> 1:13:58.724
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks I distract you.

1:13:58.892 --> 1:14:04.647
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with "Jerry thinks."

1:14:04.815 --> 1:14:08.192
No, but you should do the right thing.

1:14:10.988 --> 1:14:12.905
Why are you smiling?

1:14:13.073 --> 1:14:17.869
Nothing, just until this minute,
I didn't know what that was.

1:14:18.036 --> 1:14:19.912
-But l do now.
-You do what?

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.373
-Don't go anywhere.
-Chris, I didn't mean--

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:25.543
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

1:14:47.733 --> 1:14:49.317
Excuse me.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:51.527
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

1:14:51.695 --> 1:14:55.198
-l'm Caroline Lane and you're...?
-Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

1:14:55.365 --> 1:14:57.283
-Yes.
-lt's wonderful to see you again.

1:14:57.451 --> 1:15:01.662
I just knew we knew each other.
I never forget a face. Wow!

1:15:01.830 --> 1:15:04.332
Is that a Harry Winston wreath?

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.251
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

1:15:07.419 --> 1:15:10.087
You're very good.
Excuse me, I have to go.

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:13.216
Listen, just between us girls.

1:15:13.383 --> 1:15:16.302
Are you here with Chris?

1:15:16.470 --> 1:15:18.804
-Can you keep a secret?
-Of course.

1:15:18.972 --> 1:15:21.849
Good. So can I.

1:15:30.317 --> 1:15:41.452
Caroline.

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.372
-Do you have somewhere else to be?
-l have to leave.

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:46.165
You're not leaving. You're running.

1:15:46.333 --> 1:15:49.293
What l can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

1:15:49.461 --> 1:15:53.047
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

1:15:53.549 --> 1:15:55.883
Look, l've made
so many mistakes already.

1:15:56.051 --> 1:16:00.429
-l just don't want to make it worse.
-You won't. l promise.

1:16:00.889 --> 1:16:03.766
There's something
you don't know, okay?

1:16:04.643 --> 1:16:06.269
Oh, God. How do l tell you this?

1:16:07.104 --> 1:16:11.566
-The first time you saw me, I was--
-You were mesmerizing.

1:16:24.496 --> 1:16:27.290
If tonight is all we have...

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:31.127
...stay. Please.

1:18:15.691 --> 1:18:18.109
It's over, baby.

1:18:29.996 --> 1:18:32.164
Hi, honey.

1:18:32.791 --> 1:18:34.625
I'm good.

1:18:34.793 --> 1:18:37.002
At work.

1:18:37.170 --> 1:18:41.799
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in
about 1 0 minutes, and l'll be home at 6.

1:18:41.967 --> 1:18:44.510
Did you and Steph have a good time?

1:18:44.678 --> 1:18:46.303
Yeah?

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:02.403
What are you gonna do in Buffalo?

1:19:02.571 --> 1:19:05.781
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

1:19:05.949 --> 1:19:09.160
-Do you think that's too obvious?
-No.

1:19:13.623 --> 1:19:16.542
-A Harry Winston wreath?
-Morning.

1:19:17.294 --> 1:19:20.045
Isn't that that maid?

1:19:21.923 --> 1:19:25.009
I mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? I thought maybe--

1:19:25.177 --> 1:19:28.888
I'll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

1:19:30.766 --> 1:19:33.976
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

1:19:37.022 --> 1:19:41.066
I mean, it could be her.

1:19:41.234 --> 1:19:44.862
Let's just--
Can we just go forward?

1:19:48.742 --> 1:19:51.535
Wait! That's my Dolce coat!

1:19:51.703 --> 1:19:55.039
-How could you have missed that?
-l'm sorry, sir.

1:19:57.959 --> 1:20:00.044
I'll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

1:20:00.212 --> 1:20:03.672
And l'll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:08.928
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

1:20:31.076 --> 1:20:32.910
Lionel. Marisa.

1:20:33.078 --> 1:20:37.164
Oh. Well, that's interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

1:20:37.332 --> 1:20:40.084
I thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

1:20:40.252 --> 1:20:43.587
And l suppose you think
it's polite to steal people's clothes?

1:20:45.715 --> 1:20:48.259
-l didn't steal--
-Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

1:20:48.426 --> 1:20:51.720
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

1:20:51.888 --> 1:20:54.098
I suggest you say as little as possible.

1:20:54.266 --> 1:20:56.100
We have it all on video.

1:20:56.268 --> 1:20:57.935
Was everything returned?

1:20:58.812 --> 1:21:01.730
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, Chris, l'm terribly sorry...

1:21:01.898 --> 1:21:05.234
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

1:21:05.402 --> 1:21:08.070
-What is going on?
-The woman you thought was a guest...

1:21:08.238 --> 1:21:10.531
...on this floor is the maid on this floor.

1:21:10.699 --> 1:21:11.949
Aren't you, Marisa?

1:21:12.117 --> 1:21:14.285
No. Wait, her name is Caroline.

1:21:14.452 --> 1:21:18.622
No, Chris, darling, that's my name.
She steals clothes, identities--

1:21:18.790 --> 1:21:22.626
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

1:21:23.962 --> 1:21:25.796
Caroline?

1:21:27.883 --> 1:21:29.508
Is this true?

1:21:36.433 --> 1:21:38.100
Yeah, it is.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:42.521
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

1:21:42.689 --> 1:21:44.565
There's no reason to involve the press.

1:21:44.733 --> 1:21:46.859
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:48.986
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

1:21:49.154 --> 1:21:52.197
I can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

1:21:52.365 --> 1:21:56.452
Lionel, you are slipping. You should've
noticed something. I am disappointed.

1:21:56.620 --> 1:21:59.288
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

1:21:59.456 --> 1:22:01.957
Of course, sir. l understand.

1:22:02.125 --> 1:22:05.502
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

1:22:05.670 --> 1:22:07.546
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

1:22:07.714 --> 1:22:10.007
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

1:22:11.593 --> 1:22:14.345
-Yes, sir.
-ls that really necessary?

1:22:14.512 --> 1:22:17.056
Chris, let the man do his job, okay?

1:22:17.223 --> 1:22:19.350
Oh, Chris.

1:22:19.517 --> 1:22:24.188
Oh, Chris. I can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

1:22:24.356 --> 1:22:26.357
It isn't. Spare yourself.

1:22:26.524 --> 1:22:28.192
At least let me buy you lunch.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:32.196
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

1:22:32.364 --> 1:22:37.368
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

1:22:37.869 --> 1:22:39.912
Drinks, then?

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:44.041
I need your nametag, passkey
and your lD card.

1:22:44.209 --> 1:22:47.962
-Sorry, Marisa, but I have to.
-l understand.

1:22:49.089 --> 1:22:51.590
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

1:22:51.758 --> 1:22:53.342
No.

1:22:53.510 --> 1:22:57.346
Actually, I made a decision
a moment ago.

1:22:57.514 --> 1:22:59.390
It was long overdue.

1:23:01.059 --> 1:23:02.935
You quit?

1:23:03.103 --> 1:23:05.062
Sometimes...

1:23:05.230 --> 1:23:10.234
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

1:23:10.944 --> 1:23:12.778
Thank you.

1:23:13.113 --> 1:23:16.240
Thanks, Keef. Bye.

1:23:16.866 --> 1:23:19.451
To serve people...

1:23:19.619 --> 1:23:22.246
...takes dignity and intelligence.

1:23:22.414 --> 1:23:26.291
But remember,
they're only people with money.

1:23:26.459 --> 1:23:31.255
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

1:23:31.423 --> 1:23:36.969
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

1:23:37.137 --> 1:23:42.433
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

1:23:45.979 --> 1:23:49.314
I think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

1:23:51.776 --> 1:23:55.988
And it's been my great honor
to have worked with you.

1:24:14.174 --> 1:24:15.966
Marisa?

1:24:16.134 --> 1:24:19.219
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
I don't know which name to use.

1:24:19.387 --> 1:24:21.305
Marisa.

1:24:21.473 --> 1:24:23.307
I don't get it. What just happened?

1:24:23.475 --> 1:24:25.142
What don't you get? I'm the maid.

1:24:25.310 --> 1:24:28.187
What was all this, some kind of bet?

1:24:28.354 --> 1:24:30.314
A little game of what, get-the-guests?

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:32.941
I was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

1:24:33.109 --> 1:24:35.319
...and you invited
me out, and everything--

1:24:35.487 --> 1:24:38.155
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

1:24:38.323 --> 1:24:39.573
Who's kidding who here?

1:24:39.741 --> 1:24:42.659
Think you would've looked at me
if you knew l was the maid?

1:24:42.827 --> 1:24:43.827
-Well....
-Come on.

1:24:43.995 --> 1:24:45.871
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

1:24:46.039 --> 1:24:49.500
-...I don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
-You didn't give me a chance.

1:24:49.667 --> 1:24:53.837
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

1:24:54.005 --> 1:24:55.672
And you think they're not?

1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:58.801
Come on. Half the time, l'm
a stereotype they make fun of.

1:24:58.968 --> 1:25:02.429
The other half of the time, l'm
invisible. Maybe that's the point.

1:25:02.597 --> 1:25:06.308
First time you saw me, l was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

1:25:06.476 --> 1:25:09.186
Was I supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

1:25:09.354 --> 1:25:11.730
-You can't nail me for that.
-What are you doing?

1:25:11.898 --> 1:25:13.023
Not now, Jerry. Just--

1:25:13.191 --> 1:25:14.733
-Go.
-You might as well sell tickets.

1:25:14.901 --> 1:25:16.193
-l don't care.
-You care.

1:25:18.154 --> 1:25:21.031
-No. No. No. No.
-Marisa.

1:25:21.199 --> 1:25:22.741
I just want the truth.

1:25:26.871 --> 1:25:29.373
All right, you want the truth?

1:25:31.876 --> 1:25:35.295
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

1:25:35.463 --> 1:25:39.383
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

1:25:42.345 --> 1:25:44.054
And l'm sorry.

1:25:44.222 --> 1:25:45.806
Truly.

1:25:45.974 --> 1:25:49.560
If l could rewind the past week,
I would.

1:25:51.729 --> 1:25:53.522
Was any of it real?

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:58.944
Yeah, it was real.

1:26:00.071 --> 1:26:03.949
It was so real it made me wonder
how l was ever gonna give you up.

1:26:06.911 --> 1:26:11.582
But l had to give you up.
That was the plan.

1:26:14.294 --> 1:26:16.712
And then....

1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:19.256
Last night...

1:26:20.592 --> 1:26:22.718
...l couldn't.

1:28:13.705 --> 1:28:18.208
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

1:28:18.376 --> 1:28:19.626
Hi, baby.

1:28:19.794 --> 1:28:21.795
She told me what happened.

1:28:21.963 --> 1:28:24.798
Hey, Ma. You okay?

1:28:24.966 --> 1:28:27.050
Scoot over, let me see your homework.

1:28:27.218 --> 1:28:28.719
I don't know what to say.

1:28:28.886 --> 1:28:31.722
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

1:28:31.889 --> 1:28:34.057
Will you look at me?

1:28:34.225 --> 1:28:37.519
No. I'm gonna take a bath.

1:28:43.526 --> 1:28:45.360
Don't, Mom.

1:28:45.528 --> 1:28:49.031
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

1:28:49.198 --> 1:28:50.741
Someone like what?

1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:54.077
Chris Marshall.

1:28:54.245 --> 1:28:57.080
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

1:28:57.248 --> 1:29:00.250
Where is your pride, Marisa?

1:29:00.418 --> 1:29:02.794
People like you make people
like him a God.

1:29:02.962 --> 1:29:06.048
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

1:29:06.215 --> 1:29:08.091
...that we don't want to dream about?

1:29:08.259 --> 1:29:11.970
It must really burn you that I think
I have the right to go out with him.

1:29:12.138 --> 1:29:14.598
You don't.

1:29:14.932 --> 1:29:18.143
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

1:29:20.813 --> 1:29:23.648
-What happened to you?
-Don't speak to me like that.

1:29:23.816 --> 1:29:26.651
I am not the one
who lost her job today.

1:29:26.819 --> 1:29:29.071
No, I did. l messed up.

1:29:29.238 --> 1:29:33.367
Okay? lt's all my fault. You know what?
It's all right. l'll be fine.

1:29:33.534 --> 1:29:36.078
You will because
we'll call Senora Rodriguez.

1:29:36.245 --> 1:29:40.624
-She owes me a favor. She has--
-l'm not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

1:29:40.792 --> 1:29:43.502
I love you, okay? I do.

1:29:43.669 --> 1:29:46.546
But l don't want to clean houses.

1:29:46.714 --> 1:29:48.840
There's nowhere to go from there.

1:29:50.176 --> 1:29:55.472
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:59.101
And they come every month
like clockwork.

1:29:59.268 --> 1:30:01.353
You want to end up
back in the projects?

1:30:01.521 --> 1:30:05.315
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

1:30:05.483 --> 1:30:08.985
You want to put food on the table?
Call Senora Rodriguez.

1:30:13.366 --> 1:30:15.700
You're right, Ma.

1:30:15.868 --> 1:30:18.412
I'm a good cleaning lady.

1:30:18.830 --> 1:30:21.832
I'll start over.

1:30:21.999 --> 1:30:24.000
But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.

1:30:26.087 --> 1:30:29.256
I'm gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

1:30:29.424 --> 1:30:33.802
After some time passes, I'm gonna
apply for the management program.

1:30:33.970 --> 1:30:36.847
And when I get the chance
to be a manager....

1:30:37.014 --> 1:30:40.559
And l will, Ma. I know I will.

1:30:40.726 --> 1:30:43.478
I'm going to take
that chance without any fear.

1:30:43.646 --> 1:30:47.399
Without your voice
in my head telling me that l can't.

1:30:53.156 --> 1:30:54.197
Did you see this?

1:30:55.533 --> 1:30:57.742
-How did it start?
-Did he know you were a maid?

1:30:57.910 --> 1:31:00.745
-Are you a Beresford perk?
-How long were you involved?

1:31:00.913 --> 1:31:02.247
How did they find you out?

1:31:02.415 --> 1:31:04.833
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

1:31:05.001 --> 1:31:07.711
-Did Democrats put you up to this?
-Does he tip well?

1:31:07.879 --> 1:31:10.088
Is it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

1:31:10.256 --> 1:31:12.757
l'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

1:31:12.925 --> 1:31:16.720
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

1:31:16.888 --> 1:31:19.848
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

1:31:20.016 --> 1:31:21.558
Who's kidding who here?

1:31:21.726 --> 1:31:24.728
Think you would've looked
at me if you knew l was the maid?

1:31:24.896 --> 1:31:27.063
-With respect--
-Oh, shit.

1:31:28.274 --> 1:31:29.483
Oh, my God.

1:31:30.109 --> 1:31:32.235
We won't--
We will not be answering--

1:31:32.403 --> 1:31:35.238
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

1:31:35.406 --> 1:31:38.366
Mr. Marshall will make a statement.

1:31:43.372 --> 1:31:45.081
Morning.

1:31:45.249 --> 1:31:47.417
I'd like to make a short statement.

1:31:47.585 --> 1:31:51.296
And it will be all
that I have to say about this....

1:31:51.464 --> 1:31:54.758
This invasion of my privacy.

1:31:56.969 --> 1:32:00.055
I happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

1:32:00.223 --> 1:32:06.144
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

1:32:07.188 --> 1:32:09.439
And we became friends.

1:32:11.692 --> 1:32:16.071
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

1:32:16.239 --> 1:32:20.116
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

1:32:22.912 --> 1:32:26.164
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

1:32:26.332 --> 1:32:30.043
...as a result of that friendship with me.

1:32:39.470 --> 1:32:43.557
I need these numbers
to be plus 1 0 percent.

1:33:05.037 --> 1:33:07.497
Welcome to the employee cafeteria.

1:33:10.501 --> 1:33:13.336
It's open 24 hours a day....

1:33:13.879 --> 1:33:15.672
Please.

1:33:33.482 --> 1:33:35.567
Is today the 1 9th?

1:33:35.735 --> 1:33:37.861
Six more shopping days.

1:33:38.029 --> 1:33:39.696
He's here. He's back!

1:33:39.864 --> 1:33:43.992
-Who? What are you reading?
-Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:46.536
So? Go put your clothes on.
It's late.

1:33:46.704 --> 1:33:49.122
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

1:33:49.290 --> 1:33:52.917
I don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. lt's cold.

1:33:53.085 --> 1:33:54.628
At your hotel.

1:33:54.795 --> 1:33:55.962
-Ma!
-What?

1:33:56.130 --> 1:33:57.213
At your hotel!

1:33:57.381 --> 1:33:59.591
I heard you, bubba!

1:33:59.759 --> 1:34:03.720
Don't you think it's weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

1:34:04.513 --> 1:34:07.390
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

1:34:07.558 --> 1:34:10.018
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

1:34:10.186 --> 1:34:11.895
I thought we talked about this.

1:34:12.396 --> 1:34:14.064
I know, but it's like fate.

1:34:14.231 --> 1:34:18.902
No, it's like New York City
and an available conference room.

1:34:19.070 --> 1:34:20.779
You knew, didn't you?

1:34:20.946 --> 1:34:23.990
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

1:34:24.158 --> 1:34:28.244
Remember, bubba, what l told you?
We talked about this.

1:34:28.663 --> 1:34:32.707
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

1:34:33.668 --> 1:34:34.959
You think he misses us?

1:34:39.882 --> 1:34:42.884
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

1:35:06.283 --> 1:35:09.160
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

1:35:09.328 --> 1:35:12.455
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

1:35:12.623 --> 1:35:14.999
If l get elected, l'll let you know.

1:35:16.836 --> 1:35:18.753
Did your father
leave you any advice?

1:35:18.921 --> 1:35:22.298
Yeah, he said, "Don't run."

1:35:23.509 --> 1:35:25.677
We have time
for one more question, folks.

1:35:25.845 --> 1:35:28.304
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

1:35:28.472 --> 1:35:30.432
I have a question.

1:35:31.642 --> 1:35:36.312
-What? Who said that?
-Mr. Marshall, down here.

1:35:37.648 --> 1:35:39.149
Sure.

1:35:39.316 --> 1:35:41.651
What's your question?

1:35:43.195 --> 1:35:44.320
I was wondering....

1:35:44.488 --> 1:35:47.782
-Chris, don't do this.
-No. Wait. l'm listening. Go ahead.

1:35:47.950 --> 1:35:49.033
Well....

1:35:50.077 --> 1:35:52.829
I know everyone makes mistakes.

1:35:52.997 --> 1:35:57.500
And it's a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

1:35:57.668 --> 1:36:00.336
Right. I'm with you.

1:36:01.714 --> 1:36:05.800
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

1:36:05.968 --> 1:36:09.220
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

1:36:11.223 --> 1:36:13.516
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

1:36:13.684 --> 1:36:16.186
Jerry, he's not done. Go on.

1:36:16.353 --> 1:36:21.983
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

1:36:22.151 --> 1:36:25.528
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

1:36:27.698 --> 1:36:30.325
And she made a mistake.

1:36:30.951 --> 1:36:33.369
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

1:36:33.537 --> 1:36:35.371
I mean, nobody's perfect, right?

1:36:36.332 --> 1:36:39.876
No. Nobody's perfect.

1:36:40.669 --> 1:36:44.172
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

1:36:45.090 --> 1:36:48.760
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

1:36:48.928 --> 1:36:54.182
-Don't do this. Don't throw it all--
-l'm just trusting my instincts here.

1:36:58.729 --> 1:37:00.396
-Great speech.
-Really?

1:37:00.731 --> 1:37:03.233
-Eating out of your hands.
-Thanks.

1:37:08.781 --> 1:37:09.781
Cool.

1:37:10.741 --> 1:37:12.784
Where is she?

1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:16.788
This way!

1:37:26.090 --> 1:37:29.425
-Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
-No, I haven't seen Marisa.

1:37:45.901 --> 1:37:48.027
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

1:37:48.195 --> 1:37:49.320
It will kill his career.

1:37:49.697 --> 1:37:52.156
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

1:37:52.324 --> 1:37:57.787
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

1:38:00.624 --> 1:38:02.333
-Marisa?
-Hey, Ma.

1:38:02.501 --> 1:38:07.547
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? What's--?

1:38:19.685 --> 1:38:21.477
Hello.

1:38:22.521 --> 1:38:25.064
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:38:25.232 --> 1:38:27.025
Look....

1:38:28.277 --> 1:38:30.945
Can we start over?

1:38:31.113 --> 1:38:33.573
Second chance, second date?

1:38:33.741 --> 1:38:36.075
You as you, me as me.

1:38:36.243 --> 1:38:38.453
No secrets.

1:38:39.288 --> 1:38:41.039
What do you think?

1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:45.793
-We know you're in there!
-Open up! Only one way out.

1:38:56.221 --> 1:38:58.348
Marisa Ventura.

1:38:59.892 --> 1:39:02.101
Housekeeping.

1:39:02.895 --> 1:39:06.731
Chris Marshall. Candidate for Senate.

1:39:07.191 --> 1:39:08.858
I'd appreciate your vote.

1:39:10.861 --> 1:39:12.195
We'll see.

1:39:15.157 --> 1:39:16.574
We're in!

1:39:16.742 --> 1:39:18.952
Mr. Marshall, over here!

1:39:19.119 --> 1:39:21.120
Mr. Marshall.

1:39:35.886 --> 1:39:37.220
What's your relationship...

1:39:37.388 --> 1:39:41.182
-...with the Latin community?
-Excellent. He speaks Latin-- Spanish.

1:39:45.354 --> 1:39:47.355
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

1:39:47.523 --> 1:39:51.818
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?
