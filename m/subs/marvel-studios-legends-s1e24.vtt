WEBVTT

00:29.612 --> 00:31.531
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.867


00:38.788 --> 00:41.291
Eight hours, White Wolf.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.251
Then we come for him.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.632
Hi. John Walker. Captain America.

00:53.428 --> 00:58.183
Well, let's put down the pointy sticks
and we can talk this through?

00:58.266 --> 00:59.809
Hey, John, take it easy.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.563
You might wanna fight Bucky
before you tangle with the Dora Milaje.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.566
Dora Milaje have no jurisdiction here.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.568
The Dora Milaje have jurisdiction

01:08.651 --> 01:11.279
wherever the Dora Milaje
find themselves to be.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.282
Ladies...

01:19.454 --> 01:21.539
No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.791
Hmm.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.044
T'- I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.212
No games.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.424
Just don't freeze when you see her.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.218
What are you talking about?

01:33.593 --> 01:34.844
I never freeze.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.601
T'- Nakia...

01:43.686 --> 01:45.021
I...

01:45.105 --> 01:46.147
Hey!

01:52.237 --> 01:53.321
- Thank you.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.907
- Did he freeze?

01:55.990 --> 01:57.659
Like an antelope in headlights.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.911
Are you finished?

02:00.662 --> 02:01.913
Dora Milaje!

02:05.708 --> 02:07.502
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.133
A misidentified Wakandan artifact

02:13.216 --> 02:15.677
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.887
Ulysses Klaue...

02:17.971 --> 02:21.057
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.101
in South Korea tomorrow night.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.813
Bast willing, this will go quickly...

02:26.896 --> 02:29.566
and I can get
this ridiculous thing off my head.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.527
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.321
What? It's a disgrace.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.709
Get out of here, boss!

03:20.825 --> 03:24.954
- I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge for the mantles of king...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.122
and Black Panther.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.294
Do not do this, T'Challa.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.924
T'- I accept your challenge.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.676
Let the challenge begin.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.688
Is there nothing that can be done?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.400
No!

04:01.532 --> 04:03.493
- You are
the greatest warrior Wakanda has.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.872
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

04:07.956 --> 04:08.998
Overthrow?

04:09.874 --> 04:11.000
Nakia!

04:12.627 --> 04:15.588
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

04:15.672 --> 04:19.550
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.553
- We're gonna send
vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.098
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

04:25.181 --> 04:27.809
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.937
And their children.
And anyone else who takes their side.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.440
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.449
T'- N'Jadaka!

04:45.118 --> 04:46.119
I am not dead!

04:46.786 --> 04:47.912
He lives.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.249
You!

04:51.332 --> 04:53.501
Your heart is so full of hatred...

04:53.584 --> 04:55.628
you are not fit to be a king!

05:06.556 --> 05:07.598
Wakanda forever.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.108


05:21.070 --> 05:24.073
- What I'm about to do
to your stubborn little planet...

05:24.407 --> 05:25.825
I'm gonna enjoy it...

05:26.242 --> 05:27.660
Something's entered the atmosphere.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.500
T'- You are in Wakanda now.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.920
Thanos will have nothing but dust...

05:38.755 --> 05:39.756
and blood.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.216
We have blood to spare.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.261
This will be the end of Wakanda.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.848
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.694
This is no place to die.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.743
Everybody comes home.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.525
Move or you will be moved.
