00:19.450 --> 00:21.918
I always wanted to be
in the movies

00:23.154 --> 00:29.115
When I was little I thought for sure
one day, I could be a big big star...

00:29.293 --> 00:31.386
Or maybe just beautiful...

00:31.595 --> 00:34.962
Beautiful and rich,
like the women on TV

00:35.733 --> 00:38.258
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams

00:38.402 --> 00:40.893
And I guess you can
call me a real romantic

00:41.038 --> 00:44.735
Because I truly believe that
one day... they'll come true

00:45.109 --> 00:47.634
So I dream about it for hours

00:47.812 --> 00:51.482
As the years went by,
I learnt to stop sharing this with people

00:51.517 --> 00:53.074
They said I was dreaming

00:53.184 --> 00:56.915
But back then, I believed
it whole heartily

00:57.188 --> 01:00.715
So whenever I was down,
I would just escape into my mind

01:01.058 --> 01:04.084
To my other live, where
I was someone else

01:04.260 --> 01:06.456
It made me happy to think
that all these people...

01:06.597 --> 01:08.997
just didn't know yet
who I was gonna be

01:09.200 --> 01:11.930
But 1 day they'll all see

01:12.169 --> 01:15.070
I heard that Marilyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

01:15.106 --> 01:17.301
And I thought for sure,
it could be like that

01:17.475 --> 01:19.340
So I started growing up
real young...

01:19.543 --> 01:23.604
And I always secretly looking
for who is gonna discover me?

01:23.747 --> 01:25.578
Was it this guy?

01:28.085 --> 01:29.609
Or maybe this one?

01:30.287 --> 01:31.754
You never knew

01:32.623 --> 01:36.081
But even if they couldn't take me
all the way... like Marilyn

01:36.193 --> 01:38.923
They would somehow
believe in me just enough

01:39.029 --> 01:44.160
They would see me for what I could
be, and think I was beautiful

01:46.237 --> 01:48.432
Like a diamond in the rough

01:49.507 --> 01:51.498
They'll take me away...

01:51.609 --> 01:53.167
To my new life

01:53.377 --> 01:55.436
And my new world

01:55.579 --> 01:57.706
Where everything
would be different

02:01.252 --> 02:06.588
Yeah, I lived that way
for long long time

02:06.824 --> 02:10.590
And my head dreaming
like that

02:10.661 --> 02:12.253
It was nice

02:12.429 --> 02:14.294
1 day it just stopped

02:33.250 --> 02:35.309
By the time I met
you all...

02:35.719 --> 02:39.155
Shame...
all I want is a beer

02:55.172 --> 02:57.163
How are you doing?
- Great

02:57.208 --> 02:58.334
Anyone sitting here?

02:58.442 --> 02:59.909
No

03:22.132 --> 03:25.101
Madam our services
are for patrons only

03:28.939 --> 03:31.203
Give me a beer
whatever cheapest

03:33.244 --> 03:36.111
So what it is like,
a gay place or what?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.109
Yeah

03:39.717 --> 03:41.309
Hey, whatever, man

04:04.508 --> 04:06.442
Can I buy you that drink?

04:06.577 --> 04:08.340
I got my own money

04:11.315 --> 04:14.716
I'll have a pitcher, whatever
she's having

04:16.786 --> 04:18.687
Look, I'm not gay alright?

04:20.491 --> 04:22.254
Well, it makes sense

04:22.293 --> 04:23.658
So what are you doing
here then?

04:23.827 --> 04:25.727
My truck broke down, I'm a...

04:27.264 --> 04:29.357
I got a pressure cleaning
business

04:29.466 --> 04:30.865
What's pressure cleaning?

04:31.035 --> 04:32.832
You know steam clean?

04:33.270 --> 04:34.737
Upholstery, carpets,
you know, shit like that

04:36.273 --> 04:38.764
So I'm just getting out of the rain

04:39.510 --> 04:41.535
My name is Selby

04:48.285 --> 04:49.684
You owe me change!

04:52.022 --> 04:56.356
Fuck!

04:57.661 --> 04:59.925

05:00.030 --> 05:01.622

05:01.732 --> 05:04.326
Stop wasting your fucking
time!

05:04.401 --> 05:06.198
I wasn't trying to fuck
you!

05:06.370 --> 05:07.598
I just wanna talk to you

05:07.738 --> 05:11.299
I thought that if I bought you
some beer maybe you'll talk to me

05:12.042 --> 05:14.602
I just trying to have one
decent night out, you know..

05:15.579 --> 05:19.640
Just talk to someone before
I've to go back to my parents closet

05:19.983 --> 05:21.746
I'm sorry

05:31.628 --> 05:32.856
You don't have to stay

05:38.469 --> 05:40.869
So are you really a
steam cleaner?

05:41.638 --> 05:43.333
No, I'm not

05:45.509 --> 05:47.875
No man, actually it's
a real good job...

05:48.045 --> 05:50.343
Pressure cleaning

05:53.183 --> 05:55.344
You want some?

06:03.594 --> 06:05.391
Oh come on don't

06:06.964 --> 06:09.558

to do this

06:09.666 --> 06:11.258
Shit, I don't fucking

06:11.368 --> 06:12.528
You ready?

06:13.003 --> 06:15.631

06:22.079 --> 06:23.137
You do suck

06:23.280 --> 06:24.975
You're just a sore winner

06:25.115 --> 06:26.548
Yeah, winner though,
man

06:26.650 --> 06:28.515
Oh, man that's all
my cast

06:28.685 --> 06:30.550
You spilled some good
shit there

06:30.687 --> 06:32.154
I'm gonna lick it up
like a dog

06:32.289 --> 06:33.984
We need 2 more

06:35.559 --> 06:37.428
What's that bullshit?

06:37.463 --> 06:38.224
What time is it?

06:38.328 --> 06:40.592
The bar is closed

06:42.800 --> 06:44.859
Then why don't you take
that stick out of your ass...

06:45.035 --> 06:46.798
Now would be a good time,
don't you think huh?

06:46.937 --> 06:48.928
Now that the bar's closed

06:52.576 --> 06:55.067
What you do for is that?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.008
We had a good time
though

07:01.185 --> 07:03.881
Yeah, I know, it was fun

07:03.987 --> 07:05.784
I'm sorry, I called you
dumb dyke

07:06.590 --> 07:08.353
I don't care

07:10.160 --> 07:11.787
And thanks for the drinks

07:12.930 --> 07:14.557
No... No Problem.

07:14.932 --> 07:16.160
So see you around ok

07:16.266 --> 07:17.756
Do you wanna stay with
me?

07:18.435 --> 07:21.666
I didn't mean... you know
you don't have to do anything

07:21.905 --> 07:23.634
Shit I know

07:28.479 --> 07:29.377
Fuck it

07:29.646 --> 07:32.308
Yeah? My truck's
broken down

07:33.317 --> 07:37.811
Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

07:40.824 --> 07:42.792
All I wanted was a beer

07:42.993 --> 07:47.123
But the day I met Selby I'd spent most of the
afternoon sitting in the rain, about to kill myself

07:47.331 --> 07:48.525
So you can understand

07:48.632 --> 07:53.001
I was flexible, I mean everybody
gotta have faith in something

07:53.136 --> 07:56.230
For me? For me all I had left
was love

07:56.373 --> 07:58.568
And I was getting pretty sure that,
I wasn't gonna love a man again

07:58.742 --> 08:00.175
So I was gonna do it

08:00.477 --> 08:03.344
And the only reason I did it
was a five dollar bill

08:03.547 --> 08:06.141
I knew I probably given some
asshole a blowjob for it

08:06.350 --> 08:10.184
So really tried to piss me off that
if I killed myself without spending it

08:10.354 --> 08:12.584
Basically I sucked
him off for free

08:12.723 --> 08:14.247
So I made a deal

08:14.391 --> 08:16.689
I said God, I gotta spend
this 5 bucks

08:16.827 --> 08:18.488
But when it's gone
so am I

08:19.630 --> 08:23.031
If you've got something for me
in this life, you better bring it on

08:23.500 --> 08:25.263
And there she was

08:29.506 --> 08:32.373
Just some friends my parents
and I are staying with

08:36.446 --> 08:38.846
You wanna take a shower
or anything?

09:06.577 --> 09:09.546
Goodnite
- Goodnite

09:29.967 --> 09:31.935
I can't believe you
are here

09:33.937 --> 09:35.404
Me neither

09:41.712 --> 09:43.805
Can I touch your face?

09:50.454 --> 09:52.149
Sure

10:21.118 --> 10:22.278
Honey!

10:24.955 --> 10:29.119

10:32.062 --> 10:34.496

to be ready for church

10:36.566 --> 10:38.056
Hey, where's my shirt?

10:41.138 --> 10:44.767
Look at this, it's 5 o'clock in
the morning and she ain't dressed yet

10:48.145 --> 10:49.646
I'm sorry about that

10:49.681 --> 10:51.011
No, it's alrite

10:51.214 --> 10:52.875
Hey thanks for letting me crash

10:53.350 --> 10:54.715
No, that was nice

11:00.490 --> 11:02.082
So when are you leaving?

11:02.192 --> 11:03.523

11:03.694 --> 11:08.028
But you know, I'm gonna be hanging out
at the Moon Nite, around 5

11:09.066 --> 11:11.557
About 2 blocks up
- Yeah yeah yeah

11:12.335 --> 11:14.098
Maybe I'll swing by

11:14.204 --> 11:16.172
Alrite

11:20.777 --> 11:23.041
You have fun at church,
alrite

11:29.820 --> 11:31.253
Who was that person?

11:31.755 --> 11:33.723
She's just a friend I made

11:33.857 --> 11:36.826
Honey, I think she was a
straight person

11:37.227 --> 11:40.219
Did you check your stuff,
because she might have stole something

11:40.330 --> 11:44.994
No... I checked it, she didn't
take anything

11:45.168 --> 11:50.629
Listen, honey, you cannot bring people
like that here, what if Charles had seen her?

11:51.208 --> 11:52.607
I'm sorry

11:52.743 --> 11:56.235
A person like that... no Mdm

11:56.813 --> 11:59.646
We have no business with
people like that

12:11.995 --> 12:13.929
I'm just getting some stuff

12:14.331 --> 12:16.492
You'll give it to me when you get it

12:19.102 --> 12:20.626
Want some sandwich?

12:21.304 --> 12:24.330

asshole like the last guy...

12:45.462 --> 12:47.293

You're mean

14:29.266 --> 14:31.166
Can I ask you a question?

14:33.637 --> 14:35.730
Are you a prostitute?

14:38.308 --> 14:39.866
Yeah

14:42.412 --> 14:44.403
I don't know

14:45.081 --> 14:49.609
People like pay to be
with you, it's wild!

14:50.086 --> 14:53.544
Men must just line up
to be with a girl like you

14:54.457 --> 14:57.893
I guess, I don't know,
not really, you know!

15:00.130 --> 15:01.654
What do you do to them?

15:01.831 --> 15:04.231
All kind of things, you know,
whatever they want

15:04.334 --> 15:05.665
How do you know what
they want?

15:05.802 --> 15:07.235
Well they ain't shy
to tell you

15:07.404 --> 15:08.200
Really?

15:08.305 --> 15:09.897
Well shit, men are real
easy to read anyway

15:10.073 --> 15:11.938
Well, how about that guy?

15:19.049 --> 15:20.380
How about him?

15:20.483 --> 15:22.280
Oh, he's gay

15:22.419 --> 15:23.647
No way

15:23.820 --> 15:26.152
Yeah, man, look at him,
he tries too hard

15:27.223 --> 15:29.418
Oh man you see that
little fucker over there?

15:30.060 --> 15:33.427
Well he, he's straight up, S&M

15:34.631 --> 15:38.067
That's Trevor,
That's the son of the people I'm staying with

15:38.234 --> 15:39.701
Shit I'm sorry

15:39.836 --> 15:41.428
I don't care about that

15:42.973 --> 15:45.464
I don't realise he was gonna
be here

15:53.483 --> 15:58.284
This girl in my church, she told
everyone that I tried to kiss her

15:58.421 --> 16:00.719
So my parents
basically disowned me

16:00.857 --> 16:04.452
And I decided to come down here
and try to figure somethings out

16:04.527 --> 16:06.688
Then this happened
before I could get a job

16:08.732 --> 16:10.700
How long do you have to stay on?

16:10.834 --> 16:12.734
Not too much longer

16:13.103 --> 16:15.867
But my dad had to pay my medical bills

16:16.072 --> 16:19.132
So I made a deal with him,
that I would go back

16:19.309 --> 16:25.270
Which... you know... it... probably
for the best... maybe it'll work

16:25.415 --> 16:30.580
Maybe he'll be able to save my
soul and all that

16:33.289 --> 16:37.089
Well I bet you twenty, I'll beat
your ass in a race, rite now

16:37.827 --> 16:39.055
Oh no...

16:39.195 --> 16:40.992
Oh yeah, me and you are gonna
hit the floor rite now

16:41.131 --> 16:43.861
Serious I can't skate

You gotta help me

I know, I've gotcha, come on

16:53.143 --> 16:54.440
There you got it

16:54.544 --> 16:56.375
You better not let
me break my other arm

16:56.546 --> 16:58.207
See you can do this

16:58.782 --> 17:00.409
Your're very good, man

17:01.017 --> 17:02.109
You think you can you do by yourself?

17:02.252 --> 17:03.651
Ok
- There you go

17:04.020 --> 17:05.146
Feel the music

17:18.401 --> 17:20.028

Oh, man I love this song

17:35.618 --> 17:37.210
Oh I love it too

17:39.923 --> 17:40.947
Just like that

17:41.191 --> 17:42.215
Oh I can't do that

17:42.392 --> 17:43.324
Yeah you can

17:43.493 --> 17:45.586
No, no, no,come on,

17:45.662 --> 17:46.822

17:47.097 --> 17:48.758
Who cares about him?

17:49.599 --> 17:51.499
Come on are you ready?

18:03.613 --> 18:05.581
So we don't hit anyone

18:08.384 --> 18:09.578
Are you ok?

19:25.562 --> 19:27.689
I can't, I can't do
this here

19:27.830 --> 19:29.593
Maybe we can go somewhere

19:38.308 --> 19:40.276
How about the yard
over there?

19:55.024 --> 19:56.582
I thought you didn't like gals

20:03.032 --> 20:05.466
I don't like men anymore,
really

20:07.737 --> 20:09.500
I like you

20:17.146 --> 20:21.606
Maybe... maybe we
could go somewhere

20:22.752 --> 20:24.743
Where we can get
a room or something

20:26.422 --> 20:28.754
Oh I don't have any
money

20:43.740 --> 20:45.332

father and guess what?

21:53.676 --> 21:56.941

young gentlemen, I understand

22:17.600 --> 22:20.535

22:23.906 --> 22:25.339

22:25.508 --> 22:27.942
Just where you can take me,

22:33.983 --> 22:36.975
See, these here are my kids

22:37.353 --> 22:38.342
They are cute

22:38.388 --> 22:40.583

22:40.890 --> 22:44.087

22:44.193 --> 22:49.756

27:56.405 --> 27:59.306
We got some fucking Dettol!

30:18.447 --> 30:20.415
What the hell is happening here?

30:21.650 --> 30:24.278
Sorry it was me
I fell out of bed

30:24.386 --> 30:25.478
You didn't hear nothing?

30:25.921 --> 30:28.549
No, it's me I fell out of bed

30:35.998 --> 30:37.863
If that woman's in here, Selby, so help me god..

30:40.603 --> 30:45.336
I had a talk with Trevor, and I really
don't appreciate what he told me

30:45.541 --> 30:47.668
I don't think your father
will either

30:49.144 --> 30:52.602
If she's in here, I want you
to get her out rite now!

30:53.482 --> 30:56.042
Or Charlie bound to blow
her head off

31:09.064 --> 31:10.326
What the hell are
you doing here?

31:13.235 --> 31:15.567
No man, I just wanted to see you

31:22.778 --> 31:24.473
I got in a fight

31:25.047 --> 31:26.878
It must have been a really long fight

31:27.016 --> 31:29.883
I got a man really
beaten me up, ok

31:33.188 --> 31:35.383
It wasn't my fault

31:39.962 --> 31:41.725
Are you ok?

31:49.204 --> 31:50.967
But it's cool now

31:51.607 --> 31:53.438
It's cool

31:53.776 --> 31:55.471
I was thinking...

31:56.512 --> 31:59.140
You know I want you to
stay a little longer

32:00.182 --> 32:02.017
Cause I can't

32:02.052 --> 32:03.075
Why not?

32:03.185 --> 32:05.847
Cause I told you
I promised my dad

32:07.356 --> 32:11.918
Well, he's your dad rite,
wouldn't he understand

32:11.961 --> 32:15.453
So I'm sure he can save
your soul a week from now, rite?

32:23.472 --> 32:26.930
See, I told you...
no problem rite?

32:29.278 --> 32:32.179
I was goona use it to take you
out tonite, but...

32:32.948 --> 32:35.883
That's enough to rent
a hotel for whole week

32:36.085 --> 32:40.317
We can party, hang out,
whatever you wanna do, you know

32:44.593 --> 32:46.493
Maybe I can come back

32:50.666 --> 32:54.864
No, you can't come back

32:55.237 --> 32:57.330
Cause I'll be gone

33:06.181 --> 33:07.842
Listen to me,

33:09.284 --> 33:12.378
This is a once in a life
time opportunity

33:13.322 --> 33:18.123
Give me a week, I'm gonna go
later I'll buy you fucking ticket

33:18.260 --> 33:21.127
I'll take you there
myself, just give me a week

33:23.999 --> 33:26.729
You'll never meet someone
like me again

33:35.911 --> 33:40.041
Ok
- Alrite

33:54.096 --> 33:55.893
Where did you get this car?

33:56.165 --> 33:58.030
I just borrowed it

34:41.577 --> 34:43.067
So what do we do now?

34:45.280 --> 34:47.077
Whatever?

34:53.956 --> 34:56.186
Cheers
- Cheers

36:01.790 --> 36:03.280
It's getting late

36:44.633 --> 36:46.863
Oh My God Selby!
We thought you were dead

36:47.035 --> 36:48.400
Donna, I'm sorry,
I just came and get some stuff

36:48.537 --> 36:50.528
No, honey, you are gonna
talk to your father

36:52.474 --> 36:53.771
You stand rite here!

36:53.976 --> 36:56.536
John, yes she's back

36:57.112 --> 36:58.579
She's here

36:58.880 --> 37:00.848
Ok, hang on, hang on

37:01.383 --> 37:02.748
Talk to your dad

37:04.519 --> 37:05.918
Hello?

37:09.858 --> 37:12.952
I found a roomate and...

37:18.900 --> 37:20.561
I can't dad

37:20.736 --> 37:23.136
I'm not even staying
here anymore

37:25.874 --> 37:31.779
I just came by to pick up some stuff,
I'm not even staying at Donna's anymore

37:41.623 --> 37:46.117
Ok.. ok.. I'm an adult now,
I'm gonna stay...

37:46.762 --> 37:49.629
And I gotta go

37:50.899 --> 37:52.526
What are you doing?

37:53.335 --> 37:58.034
She's not even... gay

37:58.173 --> 38:02.405
She's just some old street
hooker, she's just using you

38:11.286 --> 38:12.583
I quit

38:13.155 --> 38:14.383
What?

38:15.957 --> 38:17.686
What're your bags doing here?

38:17.793 --> 38:19.317
I'm staying

38:21.029 --> 38:24.294
Holy shit girl, you just
made my day

38:25.734 --> 38:27.031
How did you get them huh?

38:27.202 --> 38:28.931
I took a cab

38:30.038 --> 38:32.063
But Leen, you can take care
of me rite? cause...

38:32.207 --> 38:34.175
I've spent all our money

38:37.679 --> 38:39.340
It don't even matter

38:39.681 --> 38:41.615
What you said?
You quit?

38:41.783 --> 38:44.445
Hooking... I quit hooking

38:44.619 --> 38:45.813
Why?

38:46.355 --> 38:49.449
Why? because it's shit, it's time man,
I fucking hate it

38:49.891 --> 38:51.381
I thought you said
it wasn't that bad

38:51.526 --> 38:54.791
Oh.. it is, you know, but,
not always, it's not the point

38:54.930 --> 38:56.625
I got you now

38:56.832 --> 38:58.925
I got everything going for me

38:59.768 --> 39:01.326
So I'm gonna do a broil

39:01.470 --> 39:03.836
This time I'm doing
it a broil

39:03.905 --> 39:05.031
How about that?

39:05.340 --> 39:08.036
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

39:08.343 --> 39:11.107
Exactly... I'll get a job

39:11.246 --> 39:15.876
Go clean... straighten up, you know,
fuck it, man, I'll get a career

39:16.685 --> 39:21.952
House, car... you know,
how about that

39:23.458 --> 39:25.824
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

39:26.128 --> 39:28.289
I've been thinking
about that

39:29.531 --> 39:31.931
I was thinking maybe like
a veterinarian, you know

39:32.067 --> 39:34.035
Cos I fucking love animals,
you know

39:34.136 --> 39:35.728
Yeah...

39:36.004 --> 39:40.134
But that's a doctor...
you gotta get a degree for that

39:41.109 --> 39:45.569
No, I'm not, no

39:46.448 --> 39:50.316
Shit, I know, you know
what I always wanted to be?

39:50.452 --> 39:51.919
What?

39:52.020 --> 39:54.454
President of the US

40:10.105 --> 40:12.938
I just haven't been feeling too good
lately, you know

40:16.445 --> 40:18.072
But I will though, man

40:18.747 --> 40:20.544
I'll be feeling great

40:24.820 --> 40:28.278
It's fucking
celebration time

40:29.157 --> 40:32.718
Oh yes this is...
this is big

40:32.861 --> 40:36.092
I once heard this thing that
always stuck with me

40:36.431 --> 40:37.659
I must've been around
13 years old

40:37.833 --> 40:41.030
Cause I remember I just
put the baby up for adoption

40:41.203 --> 40:43.194
They call the assembly
of my junior high

40:43.338 --> 40:45.465
Cause this guy who played
drum for certain workmen...

40:45.674 --> 40:47.437
Was coming to talk to
us about success...

40:47.576 --> 40:49.942
and making your mark
on the world

40:50.345 --> 40:53.803
I don't have any experience,
per se...

40:53.949 --> 40:57.214
I'm a real... I mean
I'm a real hard worker

40:57.385 --> 41:00.582
I was real excited, cause he was
the 1st real celebrity I've seen...

41:00.856 --> 41:02.653
And this was exactly the
kind of thing I wanted to learn...

41:02.757 --> 41:04.554
How to follow in the
footsteps of...

41:04.759 --> 41:05.919
I don't even write it
down, you know

41:06.061 --> 41:07.688
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

41:07.896 --> 41:11.127
And you should know that
I've worked with people all my life

41:11.466 --> 41:14.162
So I'm real good with
people and...

41:15.103 --> 41:17.503
I know how to work the roledex

41:17.706 --> 41:19.367
So I listen real hard to any advice he had

41:20.909 --> 41:24.345
For sure he said something
that stuck rite in my real mind

41:24.479 --> 41:27.642
It was all you need in
life... is love

41:27.782 --> 41:29.181
And to believe in
yourself

41:29.484 --> 41:31.418
then there's nothing you can't do

41:34.356 --> 41:36.620
To make sure that i have all
this straight

41:36.791 --> 41:40.192
Basically, you've no experience,
no college degree...

41:40.328 --> 41:43.092
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

41:43.231 --> 41:45.665
And now you would
like to be... a lawyer

41:46.268 --> 41:50.034
No, see... I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

41:50.171 --> 41:52.036
It said you were looking
for a secretary

41:52.140 --> 41:54.904
Ok, well you need to
learn how to type...

41:55.043 --> 41:56.635
You'll need computer skills

41:56.778 --> 41:58.575
Most of our secretaries
have college degree

41:58.680 --> 42:01.740
Infact most of them have
specialised in law

42:01.883 --> 42:06.411
I don't mean to sound harsh, but
frankly this is a little insulting

42:08.857 --> 42:10.620
All that looks great,
It must be wonderful, but...

42:10.759 --> 42:12.056
Can I tell you something?

42:12.227 --> 42:15.788
When the beach party is over, you
don't get to say, you know what

42:15.964 --> 42:19.024
I think now I would like to have what everybody
else has worked their entire life for...

42:19.134 --> 42:20.726
It doesn't work that way

42:21.670 --> 42:23.535
Fuck you, man!

42:23.705 --> 42:25.036
Yeah fuck you!

42:25.140 --> 42:27.074
You don't fucking
know me

42:27.175 --> 42:29.268
Ok, great, that's great, see?

42:29.411 --> 42:34.178
Now I'm so sorry I didn't hire you before.
Leslie could you please escort miss...

42:34.282 --> 42:37.046
I don't even know her name, because of course
she doesn't have a resume...

42:37.152 --> 42:39.677
No need, you fucking asshole,
you piece of shit

42:39.821 --> 42:41.755
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

42:42.924 --> 42:44.391
Take your fucking job and fucking shove it!

42:45.594 --> 42:47.687
Fuck you Leslie!

42:48.296 --> 42:52.096
All I need is love and to
believe in yourself

42:52.567 --> 42:56.799
Nice idea, it doesn't exactly
work out that way

42:56.938 --> 43:00.931
But I guess it was better to hear
flat out lying then to know the truth at thirteen

43:04.846 --> 43:09.112
Fuck this phoney shit, told him to fuck himself,
kiss my fucking sweet ass

43:09.684 --> 43:12.346
Slamped me out of the fucking
door, just like that, man

43:12.988 --> 43:14.455
What did he do?

43:16.124 --> 43:17.614
Not a fucking thing

43:18.126 --> 43:20.492
Not one fucking thing

43:20.695 --> 43:21.627
Stupid mother fucker

43:21.796 --> 43:24.356
I've bet nobody fucking ever talked
to him like that in his whole life

43:24.499 --> 43:27.662
Fucking office job, who the
fuck wants a job like that

43:27.802 --> 43:29.137
You gotta fucking sitting
in a little desk...

43:29.172 --> 43:30.069
You got your little phone...

43:30.205 --> 43:32.002
You got your piece of paper,
your little pen...

43:32.140 --> 43:33.869
You write shit down,
bla bla bla

43:33.942 --> 43:37.139
Fucking a monkey can
do that shit, man, fuck!

43:37.445 --> 43:39.140
I thought you wanted a
job like that

43:39.280 --> 43:40.872
You know what?

43:41.049 --> 43:43.210
No. Toby, 2 more

43:44.085 --> 43:47.054
Honey, Al says I can't give you
any tab

43:47.155 --> 43:49.771
Toby, how long have I
been the customer here?

43:49.806 --> 43:52.388
Would you cut me some
fucking slack here?

43:53.795 --> 43:55.820
Go get me 2 more

43:57.632 --> 44:01.295
Fucking lazy bastard,
it's no big deal, man

44:01.469 --> 44:03.960
Al runs a tab all the time
you know...

44:04.105 --> 44:06.005
he just probably doesn't
know it

44:06.141 --> 44:09.076
Leen, what are you
gonna do?

44:09.210 --> 44:11.542
I got it on fucking
control, man

44:15.283 --> 44:17.774
I'm kind of starving here

44:22.123 --> 44:25.092
There's no way, you could
maybe ah...

44:26.094 --> 44:28.255
I don't know, call your
dad or...

44:28.897 --> 44:34.961
Yeah I know I know,
I'm just saying for you, you know?

44:37.038 --> 44:40.201
Fuck it, man, I got shit
line up, you know

44:41.342 --> 44:43.572
It's not a fucking big deal

44:47.048 --> 44:49.175
Can I just give it to
you straight

44:50.251 --> 44:52.913
The truth is,
I'm... I'm a hooker

44:53.188 --> 44:55.247
I'm trying to clean my life up
here, you know...

44:55.423 --> 44:57.687
Go straight and questions
and all, so...

44:57.826 --> 45:00.852
If there's any link that you
can help me with...

45:04.065 --> 45:06.033
That's because I was...
- That's not even matter gonna matter

45:06.201 --> 45:07.235
Because the best you're gonna get is
factory work

45:07.270 --> 45:09.897
Hey Todd, do we even have any
factory work?

45:10.371 --> 45:11.861
Fuck!

45:12.240 --> 45:15.107
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to talk to you here...

45:21.583 --> 45:23.744
You don't have any
change, do you?

45:43.872 --> 45:46.739
Madam, I'm afraid I've to
ask you to come with me

45:46.975 --> 45:48.237
Why?

45:48.476 --> 45:50.467
Well we've had some complains
out here, so...

45:53.848 --> 45:56.009
So what they complained about?

45:56.217 --> 45:59.778
Cause I just got out,
it's my day off

46:00.488 --> 46:02.353
A day off?

46:03.024 --> 46:06.892
And what's a day off for a
whore, you go to church or something?

46:21.342 --> 46:23.207
Don't you remember me?

46:23.311 --> 46:24.972
No

46:26.014 --> 46:28.949
I busted you not eight months ago for
tricking up on 95

46:32.220 --> 46:34.916
It seems to me you might
owe me one

46:36.257 --> 46:38.555
Yeah, you sure went easy
on me

46:39.794 --> 46:41.489
You almost broke my
fucking jaw

46:41.696 --> 46:44.130
Please, you do time

46:46.000 --> 46:47.865
Climb over

47:32.213 --> 47:33.475
Sel?

47:35.550 --> 47:37.040
Selby?

47:37.752 --> 47:41.381
Selby? Jeses Christ,
what're you doing

47:41.456 --> 47:42.855
What the fuck are you doing?

47:46.861 --> 47:47.987
Please drop the fucking blade

47:48.096 --> 47:49.996
I take you to a fucking
doctor, ok

47:50.164 --> 47:51.563
Just stop it

47:55.904 --> 47:57.804
What are you talking about?

47:58.039 --> 47:59.131
You can stop Leen.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.172
Stop what?

48:00.308 --> 48:02.139
You can stop the game

48:02.877 --> 48:05.937
I'm out there trying
my best, ok?

48:06.114 --> 48:08.082
Why did you quit
hooking?

48:08.516 --> 48:12.213
Cause I needed to,
alrite?

48:12.353 --> 48:14.719
Because you thought I was stupid,
enough to support you?

48:14.822 --> 48:16.255
No, Selby

48:16.391 --> 48:18.188
That you wouldn't even
have to fuck me to get it

48:18.326 --> 48:19.315
Because I'm so hard-up

48:19.427 --> 48:21.486
No! no! Selby, that's
not the reason

48:21.596 --> 48:23.757
You said we were gonna
party, party, party...

48:23.898 --> 48:25.661
Well there hasn't been a fucking party!

48:28.102 --> 48:31.037
Nothing! when I told you
that I'm starving

48:32.407 --> 48:34.272
Cause you're using me
- No! I just...

48:35.777 --> 48:38.439
Because I fucking killed
someone, alrite?

48:45.386 --> 48:48.685
My last john, alrite,
I fucking killed my last john

48:48.856 --> 48:51.654
I was raped and beat to
fuck and was gonna get killed

48:51.826 --> 48:54.351
But I won't... I didn't wanna
lose you, you know...

48:54.462 --> 48:56.259
All I could think about was that for the rest of
your fucking life

48:57.966 --> 49:01.129
And you never know that
I fucking meant to be there

49:01.669 --> 49:04.502
I didn't wanna die,
thinking that maybe

49:05.073 --> 49:07.098
Maybe you could love me

49:08.309 --> 49:10.368
So I killed him

49:10.778 --> 49:17.047
I shot him, alrite...
I fucking shot him

49:24.659 --> 49:27.127
I'm sorry, I let you
fucking down alrite

49:27.261 --> 49:30.059
Now, you know me Sel,
now you fucking know me alrite

49:34.635 --> 49:36.000
No, I don't wanna go

49:36.204 --> 49:38.229
Sure you do,
sure you fucking do!

49:38.339 --> 49:41.900
Leave me fun,
leave me fucking fun!

49:48.316 --> 49:50.113
I'm sorry

50:21.315 --> 50:23.215
I know...

50:24.385 --> 50:26.444
He would have killed killed you

50:42.737 --> 50:44.398
I need to get this taken off and
I'm gonna get a job

50:46.874 --> 50:50.674
No, I understand that
if you can't get a work

50:50.945 --> 50:52.742
I don't even mind

50:55.917 --> 50:59.409
I wanted to go back before
it was just... so shit scared of getting caught

50:59.554 --> 51:01.784
You know that was the
only reason

51:08.596 --> 51:10.496
I'm a hooker

51:42.830 --> 51:44.422
You got a wet pussy?

51:47.234 --> 51:49.065
Yes, sure

51:50.237 --> 51:51.829
You like to fuck?

51:55.042 --> 51:56.475
Yup

51:58.412 --> 52:02.849
Jesus Christ, you'll think nobody
ever talked dirty to you before

52:05.252 --> 52:08.085
I just like to settle
first, you know

52:11.458 --> 52:13.983
Call me daddy,
while I fuck you

52:14.728 --> 52:17.629
I try, what you like
to fuck your kids?

52:18.265 --> 52:29.005
What? I'm just kidding
with you

52:29.743 --> 52:31.643
I'm just messing with you

52:32.513 --> 52:34.504
I'll call you daddy

52:35.182 --> 52:37.013
Daddy, see?

52:37.151 --> 52:38.743
See, I'm calling you daddy

52:38.786 --> 52:40.481
I do it all the time

52:43.223 --> 52:44.451
$20 huh?

52:44.958 --> 52:46.755
Yup

52:49.696 --> 52:51.596
Some good shit here!

52:59.339 --> 53:02.831
Come on, you wanna suck it for me

53:05.612 --> 53:07.079
Come on baby

54:24.091 --> 54:27.492
Life is funny... it's hard

54:27.961 --> 54:32.125
But it's also strange, how things can
be so different than you think

54:33.800 --> 54:36.963
I remember I was just a
kid in before age club...

54:37.070 --> 54:42.440
Set up this beautiful gigantic red and yellow ferris
wheel. It lit up to nite sky

54:43.110 --> 54:46.443
They called it... the Monster

54:48.448 --> 54:49.710
You want some money?

54:53.120 --> 54:55.645
Oh my god,
are you serious?

54:56.189 --> 54:59.158
When I was a kid I thought tht was
about the coolest thing I ever seen

54:59.293 --> 55:01.158
Then I couldn't wait to ride it

55:01.328 --> 55:04.729
Sure enough, when I finally got my
chance I got so scared and nauseous...

55:04.898 --> 55:08.231
I threw up all over myself
before it even made 1 fulI turn

55:09.169 --> 55:11.034
I gonna go and wash up ok

55:20.280 --> 55:22.482
Just hang on a sec, babe, I gotta
wash up here, ok?

55:22.517 --> 55:24.074
Ok

55:25.953 --> 55:28.444
Hey where did you
get the car?

55:31.124 --> 55:38.553
My friend, Thomas, saw me on my way
home, he let us borrow it to move

55:39.399 --> 55:40.491
We're moving?

55:40.634 --> 55:42.397
Yes, fuck this place, rite?

55:42.502 --> 55:44.629
This no place for my girl

55:45.472 --> 55:48.703
Oh, man, a real place?
an apartment?

55:48.738 --> 55:51.934
Ya what you happy now?
- Yeah, I'm happy

55:51.979 --> 55:54.174
I know baby, I know

55:55.515 --> 55:57.608
We're good now,
I told you

55:57.718 --> 55:59.447
And that's what I mean

55:59.553 --> 56:03.455
In my life, it has always been the
harmless stuff that hurt the most

56:04.358 --> 56:07.555
When there're things so horribly,
you can't even imagine it

56:07.694 --> 56:10.219
It's usually a lot easier
than you think

56:12.466 --> 56:16.061
You never really know,
until you're the one standing there

56:51.138 --> 56:52.469
No problem

56:56.343 --> 56:57.833
How is your arm?

57:00.313 --> 57:01.871
It looks weird

57:13.093 --> 57:14.560
So ok?

57:22.803 --> 57:25.328
Cos I knew I was coming
home to you

57:37.284 --> 57:39.252
I love you

59:46.646 --> 59:47.908
Waitress

59:56.223 --> 59:59.920
This stuff is so good
thanks for taking me here

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:04.957
It's ok, it's ok you know

01:00:05.465 --> 01:00:08.957
It's pretty fine, but.. man, someday
I'm gonna take you to some...

01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:12.732
Real top places in the
Keys, like some real classy joints

01:00:12.839 --> 01:00:14.773
Keys?
- Yeah

01:00:14.908 --> 01:00:16.569
I always wanna go to Keys

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:19.644
I always wanna have a
house on the beach, you know

01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:22.339
But I haven't even been to the beach
since I've been here

01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:25.609
So gal I'll buy you a house
on the beach, how about that?

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.714
Those places are like thousands
of thousands of dollars

01:00:29.823 --> 01:00:33.520
So what? You think I can't
get you a house on the beach?

01:00:35.128 --> 01:00:36.652
What else you want?

01:00:39.733 --> 01:00:42.224
You want a little purple porsh huh?

01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:44.660
This is no-smoking area

01:00:45.238 --> 01:00:47.069
You have to put the cigarette out

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.365
What are you doing, man?
you gonna sing us a song or what?

01:00:49.509 --> 01:00:50.635
Let me have that

01:00:50.677 --> 01:00:51.371
Get your fucking hand off her

01:00:51.511 --> 01:00:53.274
You piece of shit!

01:00:57.717 --> 01:00:59.776
We're paying fucking
customer here

01:00:59.953 --> 01:01:02.751
What? what you got?

01:01:02.856 --> 01:01:04.551
You wanna bring it on?

01:01:06.126 --> 01:01:07.787
You all better watch your
fucking food...

01:01:07.894 --> 01:01:10.863
Cos there was a fucking cockroach
in mine, size like this

01:01:10.997 --> 01:01:13.591
This is not how you run a
fucking establishment man

01:01:39.159 --> 01:01:41.286
So what's your deal, man?

01:01:41.795 --> 01:01:43.353
Where you like to fuck

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:46.731
Like to fuck in the back?

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:49.135
So really like to get
real rough?

01:01:52.472 --> 01:01:55.669
Shit, I bet you get real
rough back there huh?

01:01:55.809 --> 01:01:57.572
Real nasty

01:01:58.044 --> 01:01:59.705
You like that huh?

01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:04.314
Maybe you wanna slap me
round a little bit huh?

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:08.780
Don't think I don't
see it, man

01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:11.984
What, you can't speak?
what the fuck?

01:02:12.325 --> 01:02:12.848
What, you got a
fucking problem?

01:02:13.059 --> 01:02:14.185
Cat got your fucking tongue huh?

01:02:14.661 --> 01:02:17.596
I don't like it rough

01:02:18.498 --> 01:02:26.530
I've never done this before,
but I have...

01:02:51.765 --> 01:02:53.858
Take your pants off

01:03:34.507 --> 01:03:36.168
Thank you.

01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:41.576
You are welcome

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.893
You wanna have a
beer with me?

01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:36.392
Don't you wanna
come to bed?

01:04:38.071 --> 01:04:39.902
In a minute

01:05:01.094 --> 01:05:02.254
Wake up

01:05:03.796 --> 01:05:06.094
Wake up, I wanna go out

01:05:27.186 --> 01:05:29.677
Hey, mind if I angle in on those nuts?

01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:36.622
This guy is an asshole right...

01:05:38.097 --> 01:05:40.065
Flick his chair over,
flick his shit around all that jazz

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:44.694
Fucking office job rite?

01:05:44.837 --> 01:05:49.137
And talking to people all day long,
bla bla bla. Bullshit

01:05:49.242 --> 01:05:50.903
Sounds like you're at fun world

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.842
What's fun world?

01:05:59.118 --> 01:06:01.746
Fun world in Orlando,

01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:21.470
Where the fuck were you?

01:06:21.674 --> 01:06:22.834
I was out

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:24.569
In that fucking car?

01:06:25.178 --> 01:06:27.510
So? What are you doing?

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.680
I'm just cleaning
this fucking pigstly we're leaving in that's all

01:06:31.784 --> 01:06:33.342
What the fuck were you doing?

01:06:33.519 --> 01:06:35.612
I was out, we needed stuff

01:06:35.755 --> 01:06:39.282
We don't need this
fucking shit, Selby

01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:42.060
Who the fuck told you
to take that fucking car?

01:06:42.528 --> 01:06:44.018
Leen what difference
does it make?

01:06:44.163 --> 01:06:45.130
The difference?

01:06:45.431 --> 01:06:46.728
Because I'm fucking borrow
a car from my friend...

01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:49.493
That's my fucking business,
ok, that's what?

01:06:55.308 --> 01:06:58.277
I'm gonna go any place
that I want to

01:06:58.478 --> 01:07:00.446
Ok? any time I want

01:07:00.613 --> 01:07:02.774
Not in my fucking friend's
car, you are not!

01:07:02.915 --> 01:07:05.145
Fine, fine, then I'll walk

01:07:05.284 --> 01:07:09.050
Ok, I don't wanna sit
here alone all the time,

01:07:09.222 --> 01:07:11.087
I wanna go out I wanna
meet people

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:15.650
I wanna hang out with people
without you fucking scaring them off

01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:22.027
Where would you like to go?

01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:23.565
I don't know...

01:07:23.736 --> 01:07:27.968
Travel... see different
places

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.900
We could go to Fun World

01:07:32.478 --> 01:07:34.275
You wanna go to Fun World?

01:07:35.648 --> 01:07:36.410
Not now

01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:38.915
No, now I gotta take the
fucking car back

01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:42.283
And now we don't have any
fucking money like usual, Selby

01:07:42.388 --> 01:07:43.582
So, you're leaving?

01:08:04.377 --> 01:08:06.038
Hey Selby, check it out

01:08:07.246 --> 01:08:09.043
Hey, there're my friends

01:08:10.283 --> 01:08:13.275
Hey remember me?

01:08:13.553 --> 01:08:15.350
I figure you guys would be here

01:08:23.962 --> 01:08:25.362
I loved her...

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:28.332
But the thing no one ever
realised about me...

01:08:28.434 --> 01:08:30.834
Was believe that I could learn

01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:34.100
I could train myself into
anything

01:08:35.707 --> 01:08:38.541
People always look
down their noses at hookers

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:42.839
Never give you a chance because
they think you took the easy way out

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:47.417
And no one could imagine the
will power it took to what we do

01:08:47.587 --> 01:08:51.250
Walkin the streets,
nite after nite

01:08:51.724 --> 01:08:54.716
Taking the hitch and still
getting back up

01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:56.490
We wanna go again

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:59.792
But I did,
and they don't miss out

01:09:00.433 --> 01:09:04.301
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipline myself to

01:09:04.604 --> 01:09:06.629
And I believe in something

01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:09.867
And I believed in her

01:09:14.013 --> 01:09:15.344
I need to sit down

01:09:15.747 --> 01:09:18.238
Oh there she is
- Who is she?

01:09:19.352 --> 01:09:20.785
I gotta talk to her

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.751
Hey you wanna ride
the Ferris Wheel?

01:09:23.156 --> 01:09:24.589
Nope

01:09:26.626 --> 01:09:28.321
We're gonna go sit down

01:09:52.652 --> 01:09:54.017
Are you ok?

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:08.330
My brothers and sisters,
screwed me royal

01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:11.963
After my daddy killed
himself, we were out on the streets

01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:15.936
And the neighbors would let them stay
over but only if I didn't tag along

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:17.373
So I stayed clear

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:19.740
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

01:10:20.546 --> 01:10:22.013
I was having a hook
anyway...

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:26.818
So I always made sure they had new cloths,
cigarettes, and stuff like that

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:30.914
But then there's 1 nite, we're at this party and this
guy comes in and he's like...

01:10:31.023 --> 01:10:32.684
She fucked so and so

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:35.093
And they're are all embarrassed..

01:10:35.328 --> 01:10:37.888
They were fucking standing
in the corner, all...

01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:43.097
So they... you know they
threw me out of the snow

01:10:43.436 --> 01:10:46.667
Screaming out, I'm a whore,
and they were so embarrassed...

01:10:46.873 --> 01:10:48.966
And they hate me
and all that

01:10:49.842 --> 01:10:51.309
And that was it

01:10:51.444 --> 01:10:54.971
I just took off never
went back

01:10:55.414 --> 01:10:57.075
That's really sad

01:10:58.117 --> 01:11:00.051
Your own family doing that to you

01:11:00.186 --> 01:11:02.381
That's how people are,
Selby

01:11:02.488 --> 01:11:05.013
Yeah... I know

01:11:05.157 --> 01:11:07.523
Fuck them,
who need them?

01:11:07.927 --> 01:11:09.087
Right

01:11:09.328 --> 01:11:10.420
Yeah, fuck them!

01:11:10.563 --> 01:11:12.463
No, right, Selby, right!

01:11:24.377 --> 01:11:26.811
Get out!
get the fuck out!

01:11:29.081 --> 01:11:30.207
You all ok?

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.878
I'm gonna call an ambulance

01:11:35.922 --> 01:11:37.412
That's ok

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:39.289
We don't have any insurance

01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:42.121
We just rather...
do it ourselves

01:11:57.343 --> 01:11:58.935
You know, she's good

01:11:59.445 --> 01:12:01.572
You have yourselves a
good day now, ok

01:12:15.194 --> 01:12:18.493
Let's go, Selby, now!
- No! no! I wanna drive

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:24.701
He's fucking dead,
let's go, now!

01:12:25.571 --> 01:12:27.596
No!
- Selby!

01:12:41.954 --> 01:12:44.149
Who killed that man?

01:12:45.992 --> 01:12:47.619
What do you think?

01:12:48.127 --> 01:12:52.461
Oh my god, they're coming for us

01:12:54.367 --> 01:12:55.299
What are you talking
about?

01:12:55.434 --> 01:12:57.561
You fucking killing people

01:13:02.108 --> 01:13:05.703
Now listen to me,
they are not coming

01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:11.914
I never wanted you in this
shit to begin with

01:13:12.051 --> 01:13:14.281
But I know what
I am doing

01:13:14.453 --> 01:13:16.045
And you'll never gonna
understand it, alrite?

01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:18.156
You gotta trust me

01:13:25.431 --> 01:13:28.167
They don't have
1 fucking thing

01:13:28.202 --> 01:13:29.327
They got nothing

01:13:29.468 --> 01:13:33.199
They are not even looking, man,
this shit is long over already

01:13:33.339 --> 01:13:37.469
I didn't want wreck the fucking car in public
but we did you know, we did

01:13:37.576 --> 01:13:41.137
So if they'll gonna call the cops,
they would've done it by now!

01:13:42.681 --> 01:13:45.149
How could you?

01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:47.751
You knew

01:13:53.192 --> 01:13:56.423
No... I knew about 1... 1

01:13:56.562 --> 01:14:01.158
No, Selby... no Sel

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:11.509
Come in here

01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:20.610
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget about all this alrite?

01:14:20.686 --> 01:14:22.278
Cheers

01:14:23.355 --> 01:14:24.686
Leen, this isn't funny

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:27.154
You don't know what's
going on, Sel

01:14:27.426 --> 01:14:31.522
I do, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whole world...

01:14:32.098 --> 01:14:34.658
The least you can do
is hear me out

01:14:48.414 --> 01:14:50.616
It's not what you
think it is, alrite

01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:51.583
I know what it is

01:14:51.684 --> 01:14:54.084
No, you don't know
my life, Selby!

01:14:55.588 --> 01:14:57.556
But I know yours

01:15:01.227 --> 01:15:03.923
And I've done everything
in the whole wide world

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:06.625
Hoping that you'll never
have to know

01:15:07.466 --> 01:15:11.630
So that you can go on
thinking that people are good

01:15:11.737 --> 01:15:15.441
And kind and that it should
make sense, you know?

01:15:15.476 --> 01:15:17.671
Cause I love that
about your, Sel

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.572
But I can't

01:15:18.677 --> 01:15:21.669
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:23.679
But you need to

01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:26.647
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kill people

01:15:37.163 --> 01:15:39.597
I'm good with the Lord

01:15:39.798 --> 01:15:41.322
I'm fine with him

01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:45.701
And I know how you were raised alrite

01:15:45.804 --> 01:15:49.604
And I know how people fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:50.675
They gonna tell you that 'thou shall not kill' and
all that

01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:55.336
But that's not the way the
world works, Selby

01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:58.678
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day living it

01:15:59.385 --> 01:16:02.752
Who the fuck knows,
what god knows?

01:16:06.091 --> 01:16:09.428
People kill each other everyday

01:16:09.463 --> 01:16:11.055
And for what?

01:16:12.765 --> 01:16:17.225
For politics, for religion,
and they're heros...

01:16:17.403 --> 01:16:21.169
No.. no... there are a lot of
shit I can't do anymore

01:16:21.207 --> 01:16:22.640
But killing's not one of them

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:26.439
And letting those fucking bastard going out
there raping somebody else isn't either

01:16:26.645 --> 01:16:28.510
No, no, Leen there
was 1 man

01:16:28.647 --> 01:16:30.706
They can't all
has been bad

01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:36.488
You know me, you think
I could do it otherwise?

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:41.089
I'm not a bad person,
I'm a real good person

01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:48.232
So, don't feel bad,
it's life, Sel

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:52.600
People like me and you go
down every fucking... day

01:16:59.211 --> 01:17:01.907
It's almost over,
look at this

01:17:03.148 --> 01:17:05.742
See this?
it's everything

01:17:05.884 --> 01:17:08.079
Everything you ever
wanted

01:17:08.254 --> 01:17:11.223
Just a little more, and a car
we're out of here

01:17:11.323 --> 01:17:13.120
We have a shot, Sel

01:17:14.326 --> 01:17:19.423
We have a shot, at a real life,
not this, a real one

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:26.568
You know what to do, rite?

01:17:29.074 --> 01:17:30.939
See you later
- Ok

01:17:33.579 --> 01:17:36.070
So everything is working out,
and we are real happy

01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:38.375
But I just thought that you
can tell my family

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.650
So you're choosing to go
this way

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:48.658
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:51.661
This is the way I am

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.765
And I'm not gonna feel
bad about it anymore

01:17:53.832 --> 01:17:55.993
You can tell him that too

01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:01.337
I know you think you're all romantic
about that girl

01:18:09.948 --> 01:18:13.281
What? I'm saying it's
not their fault

01:18:13.852 --> 01:18:16.548
Blacks or whoever you wanna
call them, Selby

01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:20.820
The point is, people make
bad choices

01:18:21.627 --> 01:18:24.926
And they pay for it, you can see
all these miserable straight people...

01:18:25.297 --> 01:18:28.164
And we see you choosing, this life..
this gay life

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.632
And even more than that, the easy life with this...

01:18:30.803 --> 01:18:33.931
No.. she has had a real hard life

01:18:35.441 --> 01:18:38.638
Lots of people have bad lives, and they
still choose to move towards the light...

01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:41.872
Otherwise we all be
hookers and druggies...

01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:45.413
I don't wanna hear this

01:18:45.684 --> 01:18:47.413
This is not the point

01:18:48.087 --> 01:18:50.317
Don't fight the world, honey

01:18:50.889 --> 01:18:53.756
There's so much more than just love out there

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:59.320
And someday all you gonna want is a roof over your
head even if you do have to sleep with a man to get it

01:18:59.798 --> 01:19:01.265
And that's your choice

01:19:01.433 --> 01:19:03.924
Yeah, it is my choice

01:19:04.103 --> 01:19:06.628
Cos we're in love

01:19:06.739 --> 01:19:08.900
What? We you going on a hike?

01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:14.003
Man, just get rite here

01:19:14.346 --> 01:19:16.405
The car was good

01:19:16.949 --> 01:19:19.713
Not when there's a
fucking gun in it

01:19:21.854 --> 01:19:25.620
So, lots of people have guns

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:32.091
Well you gonna undress or what?

01:19:32.264 --> 01:19:33.959
No, you 1st

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:43.432
So... you married rite?
you don't get that fucking shit

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:46.844
Come out here with strange gals,
do dirty things with them

01:19:48.447 --> 01:19:50.438
Why, man, so you can rape them?

01:19:51.984 --> 01:19:55.579
No, Good lord
- Fucking man

01:19:55.788 --> 01:19:57.585
I fucking hate them

01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.587
Then why are you a hooker?

01:19:59.725 --> 01:20:03.161
I'm not a hooker, see,
I don't fuck, man

01:20:03.896 --> 01:20:07.127
Used to, mostly against my will though

01:20:07.232 --> 01:20:09.928
This old guy used to rape me when I was eight

01:20:10.569 --> 01:20:13.732
Real good friend of my
dad's, you know

01:20:15.307 --> 01:20:17.502
So I go to my dad,
tell him what's going on...

01:20:17.643 --> 01:20:19.804
My dad don't fucking
believe me, so...

01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.936
His friend keeps raping
me for years

01:20:24.416 --> 01:20:28.876
And that's my dad... fucking
beats me up for it

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.656
Where the fuck do you
think you are going?

01:20:34.092 --> 01:20:37.963
I'm not doing it,
but I feel sorry for you

01:20:37.998 --> 01:20:40.431
If you want a ride
you better come on

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:42.761
I don't need a ride, man

01:20:44.603 --> 01:20:46.127
I don't need a ride

01:20:49.808 --> 01:20:52.299
Cause I wanna take
your car

01:20:53.145 --> 01:20:54.203
You fucking think I'm stupid
enough...

01:20:54.346 --> 01:20:58.112
To get back into your fucking car
with you when there's a gun?

01:21:00.786 --> 01:21:02.117
Please!

01:21:05.457 --> 01:21:07.857
Victor Borne,
that was his name

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:11.987
My dad's friend...
some friend

01:21:14.733 --> 01:21:17.395
Years later I found out he
died in a car accident

01:21:19.471 --> 01:21:22.907
Its like God finally strike him down
for all his evil

01:21:23.642 --> 01:21:26.702
No, you can't get away
from your shit forever

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.172
Sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up with you

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:33.109
Motherfucker!

01:21:34.019 --> 01:21:35.486
Where's the car?

01:21:37.055 --> 01:21:38.989
Got all fucked up!

01:21:40.058 --> 01:21:42.083
Is that everything?

01:21:42.261 --> 01:21:46.027
Got beer? fucking man,
I think we should just go

01:21:46.098 --> 01:21:46.826
How?

01:21:46.999 --> 01:21:48.489
Take the bus

01:21:48.667 --> 01:21:50.032
We have enough money, rite?

01:21:50.235 --> 01:21:50.997
We do?

01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:53.503
I don't know whatever,
I'll fucking hook down there whatever

01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:57.672
We can't take all our shit
on the bus

01:21:57.707 --> 01:21:59.704
I can't get one rite now,
ok, Sel

01:22:01.547 --> 01:22:02.775
What happened?

01:22:02.948 --> 01:22:05.974
Fucking cop, the guy
I wasn't even gonna do it...

01:22:06.084 --> 01:22:07.449
Then he has a fucking
gun in his car...

01:22:07.619 --> 01:22:09.917
So I popped him sure enough
he's a fucking cop

01:22:10.722 --> 01:22:12.849
I think he was retired or
something but still, man...

01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:14.458
I can't take the fucking car,
it was a cop car

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.457
It got some fucking tracking device in there

01:22:16.628 --> 01:22:17.219
Shit!

01:22:17.362 --> 01:22:20.126
Fucker, tried to fucking trick me,
while he's got a fucking gun in there

01:22:20.232 --> 01:22:21.995
Keep it down

01:22:25.938 --> 01:22:28.372
Well you just have to go
and get us another one

01:22:32.244 --> 01:22:35.480
No... no... not changing your
mind on me

01:22:35.515 --> 01:22:36.674
Please

01:22:36.782 --> 01:22:40.775
Leen... this isn't my plan
this is your deal, ok

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:43.217
Your plan, the house
and the beach

01:22:43.555 --> 01:22:46.080
Self-employed,
just like you said, your plan

01:22:46.191 --> 01:22:48.022
So you just have to go and
get us another car...

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.094
We are leaving now

01:22:50.996 --> 01:22:52.759
Get up!

01:22:56.101 --> 01:23:02.472
Alrite... you just give
me a sec

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:21.486
I'm gonna try to get out of
here before the end of the week

01:23:22.227 --> 01:23:24.889
That's good,
I'm proud of you

01:23:25.063 --> 01:23:27.588
Yes, I just wanted to say
good bye to you, Tom

01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:29.257
You've been real
good to me

01:23:34.106 --> 01:23:35.266
Are you alrite?

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.931
Yes, it's nothing

01:23:40.712 --> 01:23:43.875
Sometime, I feel like everybody
just think I'm just a fat shitty fucking person

01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:47.953
All I'm fucking trying
to do is survive, you know

01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:49.978
I know
- Yeah

01:23:50.155 --> 01:23:51.782
I know exactly

01:23:52.224 --> 01:23:54.351
I know what you
do for living

01:23:54.526 --> 01:23:56.084
But It doesn't bother
me at all

01:23:56.194 --> 01:23:59.630
I know you didn't dial it up
on a god dammed telephone

01:23:59.765 --> 01:24:02.859
That's where you lended,
that's what you've had to do

01:24:03.035 --> 01:24:06.766
What you're feeling rite now,
is just guilt

01:24:06.872 --> 01:24:10.075
Over something you've had
absolutely no control over

01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:12.942
You know how many of us
came back from the war?

01:24:13.078 --> 01:24:14.409
And almost kill ourselves...

01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:17.912
Because we felt exactly the
samething you do rite now!

01:24:18.283 --> 01:24:20.217
Yeah?
- Yeah

01:24:20.318 --> 01:24:21.410
And I never get it

01:24:21.553 --> 01:24:23.578
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

01:24:23.722 --> 01:24:26.748
And they sure as hell wouldn't
ever get fucking circumstances

01:24:26.892 --> 01:24:31.192
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactly it, that's exactly it

01:24:31.663 --> 01:24:34.188
You know, it's like I feel
like I never had a fucking choice

01:24:34.299 --> 01:24:36.665
You never did,
but you got a live

01:24:37.502 --> 01:24:39.333
You got a live

01:24:58.156 --> 01:25:02.149
We are not able to positively
confirm a profile at this time...

01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:04.695
However the evidence does
suggest that...

01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:09.190
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the Central Act

01:25:09.367 --> 01:25:11.232
Perhaps that's the act
prostitution?

01:25:17.909 --> 01:25:21.037
Yeah, that's exactly right

01:25:30.722 --> 01:25:32.246
Get the fuck out of here

01:25:33.058 --> 01:25:35.083
Get the fuck out of here!

01:26:35.554 --> 01:26:37.886
These here my kids

01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:39.790
They are down in Miami...

01:26:39.991 --> 01:26:43.188
So I'm just trying to make
a couples of extra bucks, you know what i'm saying?

01:26:46.031 --> 01:26:47.623
They ok?

01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:52.064
They are fine

01:26:52.804 --> 01:26:55.034
I'm just trying to
make some money

01:26:56.675 --> 01:26:58.370
Can you help me out?

01:26:59.578 --> 01:27:03.207
Maybe I can help you
out, you know?

01:27:03.315 --> 01:27:07.479
If you need some help, I'll do what
I can to get you back with your kids

01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:12.746
Maybe you need a room,
shower, some warm clothes...

01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:14.653
My son's room is empty
if you want it

01:27:14.893 --> 01:27:17.885
And I'm sure my wife
wouldn't mind a bit

01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:19.424
PulI the car over
- I'm sorry

01:27:19.564 --> 01:27:21.031
No, just pulI the car over

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.765
The car's still rolling,
you can't get out

01:27:23.935 --> 01:27:25.300
Stop... the car

01:27:25.971 --> 01:27:29.338
Listen, they can't barely see
you out there

01:27:43.121 --> 01:27:45.351
Are you in some kind
of...

01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:49.587
Just drive the car

01:28:04.876 --> 01:28:06.366
Stop rite here

01:28:08.013 --> 01:28:11.210
Look there ain't othing that we can't fix

01:28:13.919 --> 01:28:15.887
Get out of the car

01:28:26.464 --> 01:28:30.798
The keys in the car,
that's my wallet

01:28:34.973 --> 01:28:36.406
Turn around

01:28:36.508 --> 01:28:38.601
No, madam... no

01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:42.106
You don't have to do this

01:28:42.213 --> 01:28:43.237
Get down

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.941
You really don't

01:28:50.522 --> 01:28:51.819
I can't

01:28:52.023 --> 01:28:53.456
You don't have to

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:57.391
You just having a hard time
- No, I can't let you live

01:29:00.165 --> 01:29:03.999
Oh God, my wife...
my wife

01:29:04.302 --> 01:29:08.432
My daughter is having a baby
- Shut the fuck up!

01:29:11.710 --> 01:29:13.541
Oh God I'm sorry

01:29:46.378 --> 01:29:47.845

01:29:48.279 --> 01:29:50.577

01:29:56.321 --> 01:29:58.482
Sketches of us

01:30:22.781 --> 01:30:24.271
You're all set

So you'll gonna get in tomorrow

01:30:32.457 --> 01:30:36.518
I always said I'll take you to the
bus, I'll take it, you know

01:30:36.694 --> 01:30:38.525
Where I wanted to go

01:31:19.938 --> 01:31:24.739
I know I did...
I did the fuck up!

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:48.198
Maybe you can...
help me?

01:32:00.311 --> 01:32:04.304
I don't know... if I can
forgive myself for...

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.596
You'll come back to me,
You'll come back

01:32:29.807 --> 01:32:35.370
I mean, you come back here
and we go far far away

01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:42.880
Go

01:32:53.298 --> 01:32:56.392
No

01:32:57.702 --> 01:33:01.103
You take it, and
spend it, alrite

01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:06.864
2 whiskeys
2 beers

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:11.465
2 whiskeys, 2 beers

01:34:19.183 --> 01:34:21.413
- Leen
- Tom

01:34:21.552 --> 01:34:25.545
Hey, this is my only
friend, Tom

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.887
We've got a fire outside,
the old conversation pit

01:34:34.599 --> 01:34:36.123
Oh come on

01:34:50.148 --> 01:34:52.673
You run away fast
- What?

01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.910
Yes you are, I wanna
drive you out of here

01:34:58.356 --> 01:35:02.315
I gotta stay here by the
phone for my girl

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.453
Cause I gotta call her

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:07.660
Cause she left, Tom

01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:12.299
But she's gonna come back, ok

01:35:14.138 --> 01:35:16.732
You've got a fucking wife and
you tell me to come with you...

01:35:16.841 --> 01:35:19.366
What the fuck are you
doing, man?

01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:24.413
Not you, Tom,
not fucking you, Tom

01:35:24.716 --> 01:35:26.479
Fuck, man!

01:35:40.331 --> 01:35:42.492
You got some bucks
to change?

01:35:42.867 --> 01:35:44.164
You want change?

01:35:44.369 --> 01:35:45.631
Yeah I gotta call
my fucking gal

01:35:45.737 --> 01:35:47.637
Let's go, I got some
change in my car

01:35:47.805 --> 01:35:48.931
So if you want, come
with me

01:35:52.944 --> 01:35:54.707
My car is over there

01:35:54.946 --> 01:35:57.779
Yes, rite over there,
you see? the camero

01:36:07.859 --> 01:36:10.259
Man, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:21.705
Just want to fucking call my girl

01:36:30.948 --> 01:36:33.940
Selby?
- Hi

01:36:34.786 --> 01:36:37.084
Oh man, it's good to
hear your voice

01:36:37.221 --> 01:36:38.415
Yeah you too

01:36:38.589 --> 01:36:40.216
So, you back down
here huh?

01:36:40.491 --> 01:36:44.791
Yeah, I came down to
see what was going on

01:36:47.398 --> 01:36:51.391
Oh man, am I glad to hear that

01:36:53.905 --> 01:36:56.965
Yeah?
- no, we all rite, because...

01:36:57.108 --> 01:37:01.408
They caught in here with some old
warrant or something, you know

01:37:02.747 --> 01:37:04.544
But, I'm...

01:37:06.517 --> 01:37:07.575
Where are you now?

01:37:07.752 --> 01:37:09.413
In a motel room

01:37:10.955 --> 01:37:13.947
I wished I was there
with you rite now

01:37:17.595 --> 01:37:22.362
But Leen... they went
up to see my parents

01:37:22.633 --> 01:37:24.567
They were asking all
kind of questions

01:37:25.336 --> 01:37:27.361
Yeah, you now well

01:37:28.005 --> 01:37:30.872
I rather not talk on the
phone here, you know...

01:37:30.975 --> 01:37:35.469
Because, because I don't
know if they're, you know...

01:37:35.646 --> 01:37:38.706
But... don't worry about
that, Sel

01:37:38.883 --> 01:37:42.478
I mean that's just some mistaken identity
or something, you know

01:37:42.887 --> 01:37:44.115
They've got nothing

01:37:44.288 --> 01:37:46.489
So just talk about
us, you know?

01:37:46.524 --> 01:37:50.085
I can't Leen, my picture's
on the paper

01:37:50.461 --> 01:37:52.656
From when we crashed the car

01:37:53.664 --> 01:37:57.828
Selby... what are you
talking about?

01:37:58.002 --> 01:38:01.165
I'm talking about when
we crashed the red car

01:38:02.406 --> 01:38:04.033
Why are you saying that?

01:38:04.208 --> 01:38:07.006
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know Leen

01:38:07.745 --> 01:38:11.806
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

01:38:11.949 --> 01:38:19.822
No, Selby, I wouldn't do that,
you know, I would never do that ok

01:38:20.157 --> 01:38:24.116
So... just chill out
here, ok?

01:38:24.262 --> 01:38:25.957
How am I supposed
to do that?

01:38:26.130 --> 01:38:28.530
You gonna let me go down for
something you did

01:38:28.633 --> 01:38:32.626
Selby, I didn't do anything

01:38:37.842 --> 01:38:40.367
Leen, you know what
I'm talking about

01:38:44.015 --> 01:38:45.607
What are you doing?

01:38:47.451 --> 01:38:49.282
I'm not doing anything

01:38:54.292 --> 01:38:56.522
Where's the money, Sel?

01:38:58.362 --> 01:39:00.091
What money?

01:39:00.965 --> 01:39:04.594
The money I gave you

01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:08.034
What are you talking about?

01:39:09.774 --> 01:39:12.368
I don't know what are
you talking about, Leen

01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:21.912
Nothing, just some change

01:39:22.053 --> 01:39:24.988
Yeah, I got that

01:39:30.695 --> 01:39:33.425
I just wanna leave, Leen

01:39:34.966 --> 01:39:37.434
I just want a normal
happy life

01:39:37.568 --> 01:39:39.900
I don't know why you
did this

01:39:43.107 --> 01:39:45.041
Cause I love you

01:39:47.311 --> 01:39:53.079
Cause I love you, and I never
wanted to lose you that's all

01:39:54.352 --> 01:39:59.346
I love you with all my heart,
my soul, my mind

01:40:00.124 --> 01:40:04.254
And I never let you
down, alrite

01:40:07.898 --> 01:40:09.695
Cause it was me

01:40:11.035 --> 01:40:14.061
It was only me

01:40:14.271 --> 01:40:16.330
And I'll tell them that, ok

01:40:16.607 --> 01:40:18.598
But it's over for me now

01:40:18.843 --> 01:40:21.141
I'm never gonna see you again

01:40:39.497 --> 01:40:41.829
That people could forgive you for
something like this, you know?

01:40:44.402 --> 01:40:46.097
But they can't...

01:40:46.237 --> 01:40:48.034
They can't end

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.459
Thank you Judge

01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:47.891
And may you rot in hell...

01:41:47.998 --> 01:41:51.729
Sentence a raped women to death

01:41:51.969 --> 01:41:55.564
And you all, you are just
bunch of scum, that's what you are

01:42:04.749 --> 01:42:06.580
Faith can move mountains

01:42:07.618 --> 01:42:10.018
Love would always run away

01:42:11.322 --> 01:42:13.847
Everything happens for a reason

01:42:14.792 --> 01:42:18.228
For when there's life, there's hope

01:42:22.333 --> 01:42:23.994
Hope...

01:42:24.502 --> 01:42:26.436
They've gotta tell you something

01:42:27.305 --> 01:42:33.311
