(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.779 --> 00:30.864
I am Groot.

00:31.322 --> 00:35.452
Well, that's just as fascinating
as the first 89 times you told me that.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.787
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

00:37.871 --> 00:40.040
Well, he don't know
talking good like me and you.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.793
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

00:43.918 --> 00:46.254
-Exclusively in that order.
-(GROOT WHIMPERING)

00:48.923 --> 00:50.341
When did you learn to do that?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.219
Pretty sure the answer is "I am Groot."

00:54.721 --> 00:59.559
(SHOUTING) I am Groot.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.030
ROCKET: No, Groot! You can't.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.324
You'll die.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.537
Why are you doing this?

02:01.329 --> 02:02.330
Why?

02:03.039 --> 02:07.710
We are Groot.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.786
(SCREAMING)

02:42.620 --> 02:45.290
Hey, what about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

02:45.373 --> 02:47.250
No. It's too adorable to kill.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.334
(ALL CHEERING)

02:48.418 --> 02:50.837

02:54.257 --> 02:57.635
Come here. Hey, you wanna
help us get outta here? Hmm?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.888
There's something I need you to get.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.347
The thing I wore on my head.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.850
There's a drawer next to the bunk.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.602
It's in that. You got it?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.774
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere

03:11.858 --> 03:13.651

03:26.164 --> 03:28.082
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

03:28.416 --> 03:32.212
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.048
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.341
PETER: Well...

03:38.968 --> 03:40.220
That's a terrible idea.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.723
(GIGGLING) Whee!

03:44.140 --> 03:45.516
How long until the bomb goes off?

03:45.600 --> 03:46.893
ROCKET: About six minutes.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.146
Groot! If you can hear me,
hurry up!

03:58.404 --> 04:01.616
Ugh. Dude, seriously?

04:01.824 --> 04:04.160
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

horrific weapons

04:19.676 --> 04:21.386

are we talkin' about here?

04:25.014 --> 04:26.182
The Thanos-killing kind.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.354
Thor, you okay? I think he's dying.

04:31.729 --> 04:33.231
He needs the axe!

04:33.982 --> 04:35.233
