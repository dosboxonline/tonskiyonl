WEBVTT

00:04.295 --> 00:05.547
Welcome, heroes.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.925
Your journey has been a long one.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.929
Now what will you do with all that power?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.227
You know what I will do?

00:20.353 --> 00:23.106
First, I will heal my wife and my son,

00:24.983 --> 00:26.276
and all the afflicted.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.533
They say that
a water demon brings this plague.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.828
Well, I will find it and I will kill it.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.542
And I will find the god who sent it,
and I will kill it.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.295
It's been long time
since I've seen you smile.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.422
I guess I smile when I see you.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.215
WOMAN: Can you smile with your eyes?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.218
Turn aside, go back to where you came
or perish...

00:52.302 --> 00:54.304
FEIGE: <i>There are lot of ways</i>
<i>to go with Thor.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:58.016
<i>He's been drawn with more muscles</i>
<i>than any human can possibly have,</i>

00:58.183 --> 00:59.851
<i>with long, flowing blond hair.</i>

00:59.934 --> 01:02.062
But we knew early on
that we didn't want to

01:02.187 --> 01:06.024
just cast a body builder
or just cast a wrestler.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.735
<i>I'm sure there are some</i>
<i>that can act very, very well.</i>

01:08.818 --> 01:12.697
<i>But we said let's find the actor first and</i>
<i>see if we can build on to the body.</i>

01:13.281 --> 01:16.034
We did what was right.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.869
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:22.624 --> 01:25.251
His very impressive-looking physique
that looks like

01:25.335 --> 01:27.921
it can take that kind of
intense physical build-up

01:28.004 --> 01:29.547
<i>we're gonna have to put him through,</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:32.675
an intelligence, an acting intelligence
that is very special,

01:33.218 --> 01:36.262
<i>and ability to tap into</i>
<i>his primal side as well.</i>

01:37.847 --> 01:40.225
FEIGE: <i>You can't help but watch him.</i>
<i>He has a presence.</i>

01:40.308 --> 01:41.309
I love you, Mom.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.519
I love you.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.937
He's got a humor about him.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.021
I need a horse.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.357
Of course. Of course.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.151
BRANAGH: <i>We waited</i>
<i>until we felt in our bones</i>

01:50.235 --> 01:52.362
we've got exactly
the right person for Thor,

01:52.445 --> 01:53.655
<i>and Chris Hemsworth is that.</i>

01:53.738 --> 01:56.032
HEMSWORTH: <i>The idea of it being finished</i>
<i>has been sort of this</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:58.785
light at the end of the tunnel
for, yeah, a long time.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.246
And now being here is sort of like,
"Shit, now what do I do?"

02:08.670 --> 02:11.297
-This doesn't make any sense.
-Nah, nothing makes sense here, man.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.425
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.719
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

02:16.803 --> 02:17.804
WAITITI: Cut.

02:17.887 --> 02:19.264
I freaking cut.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.640
Cut.

02:20.723 --> 02:22.142
Taika, I just love working with him.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.144
We have a great thing,
we've become great friends,

02:24.227 --> 02:26.187
<i>and that certainly is a huge advantage</i>

02:26.271 --> 02:28.940
<i>because you just shortcut to</i>
<i>whatever the point is.</i>

02:30.483 --> 02:32.902
WINDERBAUM: <i>When we set out</i>
<i>to make</i> Thor <i>three,</i>

02:32.986 --> 02:36.781
we knew we could blow the franchise
wide open.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.951
We had an opportunity
to reinvent the character completely.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.001
<i>Ragnarok</i> was obviously
a huge change for us

02:48.084 --> 02:50.461
and really moved the needle into

02:50.879 --> 02:55.133
such a different territory
than we'd originally started.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.723
<i>Of all the Avengers,</i>
<i>maybe it was an advantage to</i>

03:01.806 --> 03:05.018
<i>be the underdog at a certain point</i>
<i>because there was a...</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:09.272
<i>It definitely gave me a kind of</i>
<i>a real competitive push</i>

03:09.355 --> 03:11.232
and a want or a need to go,

03:11.316 --> 03:13.943
"I can do something different.
I can do better with this character."

03:14.444 --> 03:17.113
WAITITI: <i>I've always said Chris is</i>
<i>the kind of person who you feel</i>

03:17.238 --> 03:21.784
like is fun, and he's a good friend.

03:21.868 --> 03:25.371
<i>And he's the kind of person that</i>
<i>you would want to be on an adventure with.</i>

03:25.455 --> 03:28.416
<i>Because he does like to look after people</i>
<i>and he is an adventurer.</i>

03:28.917 --> 03:30.710
I think that's what you want
in a superhero.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.130
-And it's the... Right there.
-Yeah. All right. Catch.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.424
WAITITI: <i>When I came on to do</i> Ragnarok,
<i>I basically said,</i>

03:36.507 --> 03:38.593
"Look, man, you just gotta be
more of yourself."

03:38.676 --> 03:39.677
Roll.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.221
<i>"Make the character funny."</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:43.848
I swear I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.684
WAITITI: <i>Concentrate on making him</i>
<i>more of a Chris Hemsworth.</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:48.019
Yes!

03:49.437 --> 03:51.689
So much has happened
since I last saw you.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.819
I lost my hammer, like, yesterday.
So that's still pretty fresh.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.657
HEMSWORTH: <i>Both of us were like, "Can we</i>
<i>really raise the bar with</i> Ragnarok?"

04:00.740 --> 04:03.785
And I remember
coming out of <i>Ragnarok,</i> going into

04:04.327 --> 04:05.995
<i>Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame,</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:09.082
and very adamant about trying to hang onto
the new version of Thor

04:09.165 --> 04:10.917
<i>and not go back to the old version.</i>

04:11.501 --> 04:14.420
I had some of the funnest stuff I had
in <i>Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame.</i>

04:14.712 --> 04:16.422
And then <i>Love and Thunder.</i>

04:16.506 --> 04:18.424
<i>There's a huge amount of pressure</i>
<i>coming into this.</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:22.178
He's got tight,
blue denim jeans on, a tank top.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.306
His hair's flowing. Instead of it being...

04:25.431 --> 04:27.850
-Ah! Elegant.
-It should... We're just saying that.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.144
Like, every move is like...
(MAKES DRAMATIC SOUND)

04:30.228 --> 04:31.271
<i>-You know?</i>
-WAITITI: <i>Everyone, it's amazing.</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:33.022
HEMSWORTH:
<i>And then everything's like...</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:35.692
<i>A little bit flamboyant, like,</i>
<i>a double kick, like...</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:37.735
<i>-Shit you'd never get away with normally.</i>
-WAITITI: <i>Yeah.</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:40.154
HEMSWORTH: <i>Which adds to the like,</i>
(SIGHS) <i>"What is he doing?"</i>

04:40.238 --> 04:42.782
<i>And everything's just got</i>
<i>a little flair to it, like...</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:44.701
-A flourish.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.786
I just think that he's so like...

04:46.869 --> 04:47.870
WAITITI: <i>Yeah.</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:50.164
-Find cool poses, all of that stuff.
-He could... He's like...

04:50.248 --> 04:53.126
Yeah, on the camera.
They are on record. I support this.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.087
This is probably... This is actually...
'Cause we had a... That's your idea.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.216
-We're all in it. So, yeah.
-You basically are just underneath me.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.843
-Yeah.
-It is my idea.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.595
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
-I would've thought about this.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.014
'Cause you built me, you own me.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.223
I knew you'd say that.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.476
Thor is actually now our
longest-running franchise character.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.353
This is the first time
we've done a fourth movie.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.522
And I think with that
there's some expectations

05:14.605 --> 05:16.024
to keep building upon it.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.318
Memorable and different.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.030
And a big like kickoff to
the film and the action.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.657
When we set out to make a fourth film,

05:24.741 --> 05:26.909
<i>we knew we couldn't make</i> Ragnarok
<i>all over again.</i>

05:27.035 --> 05:30.121
<i>We had to find, you know,</i>
<i>new angles, new surprises</i>

05:30.204 --> 05:32.123
and new places to take these characters.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.875
Wait, wait, wait. Play that one.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.251
No, go back. Play that.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.004
-MAN: Thor... Sif...
-Sif?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.174
-MAN: Yep, that's Sif what?
-(HEMSWORTH SNORTS)

05:41.257 --> 05:44.010
-(MAN LAUGHING)
-I'm sorry. It killed me.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.722
With the Guardians, it's just a very
different pace with that group, you know?

05:47.805 --> 05:49.599
A lot of improvisation, which is

05:50.224 --> 05:53.227
very much how we worked on <i>Thor: Ragnarok.</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:54.896
Charger? Maybe you need a charger?

05:54.979 --> 05:57.065
Of course I need to charge it.
I don't know where the dock is...

05:57.148 --> 05:59.317
THOR: Who put you in charge?
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

05:59.400 --> 06:01.069
HEMSWORTH: <i>It's never kind of...</i>

06:01.736 --> 06:03.613
<i>You're competing for jokes.</i>
<i>It's basically about</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:06.783
what's the funniest moment
within this scene that we can find

06:06.866 --> 06:08.284
and kinda help you share the load.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.204
And whoever has the button
or the punchline, doesn't really matter,

06:11.287 --> 06:14.290
it's just about hitting the target,
and it's fun.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.418
I don't know which is worse, but it's why
I keep everyone at arm's length.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.423
You've grown too attached.
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.508
You must go.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.302
<i>There's a kind of humor to it</i>
<i>and sort of irony</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:30.390
and a wackiness that
seems to fit mine and Taika's brain.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.893
Lazybones.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.353
Let's go.

06:35.436 --> 06:38.189
Asleep? Sleeping on the job, are we?
(GRUMBLES) Lazy.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.900
Just being here at the back,
try going a little bit longer,

06:40.983 --> 06:44.404
so I might get a shot on you from
the front just going... You know?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle...

06:47.073 --> 06:48.658
that goes something like this...
(WHISTLES)

06:48.825 --> 06:50.743
No, that's not it. (WHISTLES)
No, that's not it.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.996
Summoning. Summoning goats.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.458
It's just a joy to watch Taika play Korg

06:57.542 --> 06:59.544
because, obviously,
he's going back and forth

06:59.627 --> 07:01.462
between directing and playing Korg.

07:01.546 --> 07:06.050
And because it's motion capture,
he has all these dots on his face.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.971
<i>So you're trying to take him seriously</i>
<i>in one moment giving you direction,</i>

07:10.054 --> 07:12.306
and then suddenly he's Korg again

07:12.390 --> 07:16.102
<i>with the head attached to him</i>
<i>and his furry boots.</i>

07:16.227 --> 07:19.313
Taika, of course, as we know,
is an improvisational filmmaker.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.190
Add a bit more rock stuff here, Shane.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.776
Let's just bring it up here.
This is where Rocket's gonna be.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.071
So Sean... Sean, we're gonna
map you over here, actually.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.241
MORRISON: <i>It's honestly when your brain</i>
<i>is the most fully engaged</i>

07:30.575 --> 07:32.743
because there are no limitations.

07:32.827 --> 07:36.456
<i>With a lot of filmmakers,</i>
<i>there's responsible practicality,</i>

07:36.581 --> 07:39.834
<i>where you look at what you can do,</i>
<i>and T just doesn't do that.</i>

07:39.917 --> 07:43.087
<i>He just thinks of the end product,</i>
<i>as in like, "What would be cool?"</i>

07:43.212 --> 07:46.466
<i>"What would be the coolest thing to see?"</i>
<i>'Cause he's 90%</i>

07:46.549 --> 07:49.051
there in the audience
already watching the film he's making.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.221
-That's what I made here, so...
-You're throwing it to those guys there.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.390
-I can look there as well. So there.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:56.058 --> 08:00.104
I think Taika, he's like a big kid.
His imagination is second to none.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.399
<i>From the very first time</i>
<i>we worked together,</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:06.068
<i>it was about doing something new,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:07.612
and not getting put in a box.

08:12.366 --> 08:17.413
Taika is really good
at reflecting the way life can be.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.999
Dark and comedic all at once.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.667
The old ex-girlfriend.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.752
Jodie Foster.

08:22.835 --> 08:23.878
Jane Foster.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.171
The one that got away.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.758
Most of the time
when we're in our darkest moments,

08:28.841 --> 08:31.928
we try and deflect it with humor,
you know,

08:32.011 --> 08:34.096
<i>or if it's absurd, so it's funny</i>

08:34.180 --> 08:37.600
<i>because the darkest parts of life</i>
<i>are completely absurd.</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:41.395
<i>So, I think he really knows</i>
<i>how important the silly is</i>

08:41.479 --> 08:46.108
when the world is falling down.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.777
(LAUGHS)

08:47.902 --> 08:50.488
Okay. Hold. They're not bad.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.951
Tragedy-comedy has been going hand in hand
for a couple of thousand years.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.661
Yeah, and he does it impeccably.

08:56.744 --> 09:00.623
<i>I think also it doesn't matter what sort</i>
<i>of genre, whether it's comic books,</i>

09:00.706 --> 09:04.585
<i>if the people involved are passionate</i>
<i>about it and are good storytellers,</i>

09:04.669 --> 09:07.296
it's transcendent experience. You know?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
And with Taika, you get that.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.844
It's the... Oh, boy!
Oh, well, let me get away with it.

09:13.928 --> 09:19.892
One of the most exciting things about
working with Taika Waititi

09:19.976 --> 09:25.815
<i>is that he is very technical,</i>
<i>he's very aware, very savvy</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:28.818
<i>of all of the tools and the tricks,</i>

09:28.901 --> 09:32.780
<i>whether they be old-fashioned tricks</i>
<i>or new technology.</i>

09:32.863 --> 09:34.490
We're shooting on The Volume.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.993
It's the first time I've ever shot
inside of one of these things.

09:37.076 --> 09:41.664
You can see the background projected
360 and up to the sky.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.959
Pretty spectacular.
So it's all in-camera.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.253
And it looks pretty amazing.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.256
This is the first Marvel film that has
utilized The Volume,

09:50.339 --> 09:52.967
which is this amazing technology

09:53.050 --> 09:56.429
<i>that allows you to be</i>
<i>completely surrounded 360 degrees</i>

09:56.512 --> 09:57.805
<i>in a digital environment.</i>

09:57.888 --> 10:02.560
It allows you to seamlessly place
practical sets with a digital world.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.735
MORRISON: <i>As pertains to The Volume,</i>

10:10.818 --> 10:15.239
you're basically building a room
from LED panels,

10:15.323 --> 10:19.285
<i>and so at a moment we can say,</i>
<i>we're in this world, or in that world,</i>

10:19.368 --> 10:21.954
<i>and then, literally,</i>
<i>the entire environment around the actors</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:23.039
<i>will change in a heartbeat</i>

10:23.122 --> 10:25.374
<i>in terms of the lighting</i>
<i>and the mood and the tone.</i>

10:25.458 --> 10:26.709
<i>That's a game changer.</i>

10:28.210 --> 10:30.921
WAITITI: <i>I had such a good experience</i>
<i>on</i> Mandalorian <i>with The Volume</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:33.883
that I wanted to
bring that technology over to this shoot.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.011
Resplendent skyscape, Rocky.
There are four suns.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.638
What could be more relaxing than that?

10:39.221 --> 10:42.183
WAITITI: <i>It's a wonderful tool, and, in</i>
<i>a way, you get a lot of stuff in-camera.</i>

10:42.266 --> 10:44.852
<i>And, yeah, we only have to do</i>
<i>a few tweaks to it later on.</i>

10:44.935 --> 10:46.937
And that's really good for the actors

10:47.021 --> 10:49.106
to be able to see
the world that you've created.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.232
-Wow.
-Yeah.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.567
Beautiful.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.819
THOR: So beautiful, so rare.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.447
WAITITI: <i>Being able to see it</i>
<i>in the moment as opposed to</i>

10:56.530 --> 10:58.032
<i>just being in a world of blue,</i>

10:58.824 --> 11:00.910
I think it helps with their performances.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.790
HEMSWORTH: <i>If you're standing</i>
<i>on the edge of a cliff, so to speak,</i>

11:05.873 --> 11:09.335
looking out into the sunset,
to actually be staring into a sunset,

11:09.418 --> 11:12.380
<i>that certainly does pull out</i>
<i>certain emotions and reactions from you</i>

11:12.463 --> 11:16.592
that you may or may not get there
if it's your own imagination.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.804
It's very different staring
at a blue screen or a green screen.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.641
You know, that's quite numbing
and does require a whole lot more effort.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.894
THOMPSON: <i>The Volume is incredible.</i>
<i>It essentially casts light</i>

11:26.977 --> 11:29.563
<i>on our faces, on the costumes.</i>

11:29.647 --> 11:31.899
It feels really, really immersive.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.361
<i>As impressive as The Volume is,</i>

11:35.778 --> 11:39.824
I think I was really blown away
entering New Asgard.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.543
Stand by for shoot.

11:50.626 --> 11:54.755
You can never really replace
just standing in a fully immersive set.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.926
And perhaps one of the most impressive
sets we created was New Asgard,

11:59.009 --> 12:02.388
<i>which was a complete town</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

12:02.471 --> 12:05.975
<i>And the second you stepped onto it,</i>
<i>you would just get completely lost.</i>

12:06.434 --> 12:10.020
That's pretty cool,
this town is all practical.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.814
Real houses.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.108
People live up here.
We've rented these rooms out.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.402
Tessa's actually staying in that room.
Tessa Thompson.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.738
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
move in actually. Is that...

12:18.821 --> 12:21.115
-That's cool, right?
-You got some Infinity Cones up here,

12:21.198 --> 12:23.743
-which is these delicious ice creams.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.328
I actually came up with the name
Infinity Cones.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.664
It's a wordplay on Infinity Stones.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.040
-Did you write it? I didn't think...
-Yeah.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.168
-...that was you. I didn't...
-No, no, I did. (SHUSHING)

12:42.678 --> 12:45.598
WAITITI: <i>Going into this,</i>
<i>we knew people missed Natalie's character</i>

12:45.681 --> 12:48.184
<i>and was never really dealt with,</i>
<i>like, what happened to her.</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:51.437
The idea that she becomes
another version of Thor,

12:51.520 --> 12:54.315
that just seemed like the perfect in,

12:54.398 --> 12:56.358
and the perfect way
to bring that character back.

13:01.197 --> 13:07.077
The elements that come with Jane becoming
The Mighty Thor are inherently dramatic.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.038
<i>And in many ways, tragic.</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:11.832
<i>And Taika was very interested</i>
<i>about telling that story.</i>

13:12.333 --> 13:14.502
I've loved Natalie from afar
for a long time

13:14.585 --> 13:16.045
and I've always wanted to work with her.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.799
Taika came over to my house
to talk to me about it

13:19.882 --> 13:25.179
because I had, kind of, you know,
of course, not been in the last film,

13:25.262 --> 13:27.890
which was so wonderful
and I really enjoyed watching.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.687
WAITITI: <i>Please welcome to the stage</i>
<i>Natalie Portman!</i>

13:39.652 --> 13:41.946
As a fan, I remember
watching the announcement

13:42.029 --> 13:45.115
<i>and seeing Natalie take the hammer</i>
<i>from Taika at Comic-Con,</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:48.577
<i>and I was just so excited</i>
<i>that she was going to rejoin this film.</i>

13:50.287 --> 13:53.666
PORTMAN: <i>I just had been out of</i>
<i>the Marvel world for a while and...</i>

13:53.749 --> 13:57.002
<i>So, when he talked to me</i>
<i>about coming back and about how</i>

13:58.003 --> 14:00.005
<i>Jane would be The Mighty Thor,</i>

14:00.089 --> 14:03.008
it was interesting to get to consider

14:03.092 --> 14:05.219
what that experience could be.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.554
Mjolnir!

14:18.274 --> 14:21.819
She was, kind of... You know,
this was a very different direction

14:21.902 --> 14:24.238
for the character, and I think
had some real concerns about,

14:24.321 --> 14:27.992
"Hang on, does this match?
The continuity from this to that and..."

14:28.576 --> 14:31.328
And we just said,
"That doesn't matter." Like, you know?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.080
That's what happened in <i>Ragnarok.</i>

14:33.163 --> 14:35.165
We went "Who cares about anything
we've done before?"

14:35.249 --> 14:38.460
And so, it was just kind of a rebirth
or new exploration of the character,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.129
and she was down for it.

14:48.512 --> 14:52.057
Natalie came in very early, ready to work.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.560
She wanted to master everything
as much as possible,

14:54.643 --> 14:55.978
so she could do as much as possible.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.980
Despite having been
in lots of action movies,

14:58.063 --> 15:00.691
I'd never really done
any fight training or anything.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.152
Half is going from here,
pulling it back.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.446
Remember when we did
that shuffle footwork?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.949
Into that step.
And going over to kneel.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.868
And you're going diagonal down.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.289
It was really fun to get to train

15:15.372 --> 15:18.250
for the first time in my life
to be strong, you know?

15:18.334 --> 15:22.379
Usually, as women, we're training
to get small as possible.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.800
So it's exciting to actually
be working towards being bigger.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.260
Stand down.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.304
WINDERBAUM: <i>Natalie showed up</i>
<i>in incredible shape.</i>

15:30.387 --> 15:32.598
Like, she was ready to play Mighty Thor.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.560
This is the heavy one.
I'm clearly not worthy.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.022
Not really. But this one is...

15:40.648 --> 15:45.486
Often, if we wanna create weight,
so your guns can show.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.949
<i>So, we will create a prop</i>
<i>in a heavy weight,</i>

15:50.032 --> 15:51.450
<i>depending on the action.</i>

15:52.034 --> 15:54.662
And then we'll create them
in a lighter weight.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.163
This one, as you can see.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.623
THOR: Excuse me.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.375
Hello, that's my hammer you've got there.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.460
And that's my look.

16:02.252 --> 16:06.131
PARK: <i>For Mighty Thor,</i>
<i>we wanted to maintain a Thor feel...</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:09.051
There's certain elements
that are iconically Thor.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.553
<i>...while adding new elements throughout.</i>

16:12.513 --> 16:14.431
The helmet that we have,

16:14.515 --> 16:20.229
we went back to the old comic books
and got that vintage feeling for it.

16:20.854 --> 16:24.066
<i>And we adapted to</i>
<i>the beautiful face of Natalie Portman,</i>

16:24.608 --> 16:29.279
<i>but we didn't want to hide</i>
<i>too much of her eyes and her features.</i>

16:29.363 --> 16:30.364
Hey.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.909
It's very easy not to lose her
because she's unique.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.078
WINDERBAUM: <i>Those helmets</i>
<i>are really well-designed,</i>

16:36.161 --> 16:38.622
but they're not always
the most comfortable thing in the world.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.582
Sometimes they're heavy,
they change your posture.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.712
<i>But if you can eliminate all of that</i>
<i>and have a VFX artist put it in later,</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:46.005
<i>then that's what you do.</i>

16:46.088 --> 16:47.881
Our CG artists have gotten so great

16:47.965 --> 16:50.259
at creating reflective surfaces
like the helmet,

16:50.384 --> 16:53.637
<i>that it actually helps us</i>
<i>from a performance standpoint.</i>

16:55.931 --> 16:58.684
BALE: <i>Natalie does</i>
<i>a really beautiful job in this.</i>

16:58.767 --> 17:02.312
You know, there's some scenes
which are tough to watch.

17:02.396 --> 17:06.400
<i>And she's really just</i>
<i>a wonderful heart and soul.</i>

17:06.608 --> 17:07.609
<i>As good as it gets.</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:13.615
It's a gift to see Natalie rediscover
and reimagine who Jane Foster is.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.744
You think I really should be coming?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.954
You're a Thor. Of course you should come.

17:19.663 --> 17:24.626
I think so often,
not just in these movies but in general,

17:24.793 --> 17:28.338
it's really rare to get to
share the screen with other women.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.716
Sometimes you're the only one.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.969
<i>And in this case,</i>
<i>I think it's really impactful,</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:36.055
<i>particularly because</i>
<i>Jane Foster is a character</i>

17:36.138 --> 17:38.432
<i>that doesn't start off as a superhero.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:43.562
PORTMAN: <i>Tessa is such</i>
<i>a ferocious actress.</i>

17:43.645 --> 17:48.525
We had a lot of fun getting to show,
I think, the sisterhood in battle.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.573
THOMPSON: <i>I've done a lot</i>
<i>of physical preparation.</i>

17:54.823 --> 17:58.952
<i>I just wanted to push myself to get</i>
<i>even stronger than I was on the last one.</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
<i>The thing that really excites me is</i>

18:01.080 --> 18:05.709
getting to play a superhero
that bucked convention.

18:08.712 --> 18:12.966
And the opportunity
to get to bring this character to life.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.178
<i>This character that doesn't necessarily</i>
<i>look like me in the comics,</i>

18:16.261 --> 18:19.264
but to capture her spirit
was a tremendous challenge,

18:19.348 --> 18:21.600
and to get to do it with people
that I admire and respect.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.811
This is the best day of my life!

18:29.149 --> 18:31.026
There's also a moment where everyone,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.445
if you think about
as your primary school class...

18:33.529 --> 18:35.823
CHAPEK: <i>This is probably</i>
<i>the biggest</i> Thor <i>movie we've ever done.</i>

18:37.908 --> 18:41.578
This movie introduces
so many amazing alien species,

18:41.662 --> 18:43.288
monsters, creatures...

18:48.627 --> 18:49.837
All right, there you go.

18:51.380 --> 18:55.759
The Indigarrians, that was an army
of aliens, which was massive.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.052
God of Thunder.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.178
King Yakan.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.264
JOHANSEN: <i>It was a production line</i>
<i>for the Indigarrians.</i>

19:00.347 --> 19:01.431
<i>We had some big days.</i>

19:01.515 --> 19:05.853
<i>The Indigarrians had brow pieces</i>
<i>and cheeks and they had big, scared eyes.</i>

19:05.936 --> 19:07.855
We had people that were
sponging them blue,

19:07.938 --> 19:09.523
people that were
gluing on the prosthetics,

19:09.606 --> 19:13.152
people that were spray-painting them,
and powdering them, and...

19:13.360 --> 19:16.029
<i>Yeah, it was something to really see.</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:18.323
Yes! Bucket list, tick.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.826
CHAPEK: <i>They're just so funny.</i>
<i>It's so effortless.</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:24.580
And then we have these amazing
alien owl-bikers called the Booskans.

19:30.752 --> 19:35.007
I drink the stiffest cordials and...

19:35.090 --> 19:36.091
MAN: Straight to the...

19:36.216 --> 19:39.845
And all the black jellybeans.
Black jellybeans.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.181
Whereas these guys eat colored jellybeans.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.390
I can't stand them.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.809
JOHANSEN: <i>The Booskans</i>
<i>were really interesting,</i>

19:45.893 --> 19:47.895
<i>'cause they weren't originally</i>
<i>meant to be owl-creatures.</i>

19:47.978 --> 19:49.354
The owl-heads that we see behind us

19:49.438 --> 19:52.191
were these warrior kind of mask.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.903
And then the real Habooskan character
was underneath that.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.616
The more we started designing and honing
in on the look of the Booskans, the mask,

20:00.699 --> 20:02.201
the more that Taika was kinda like,

20:02.284 --> 20:04.203
<i>"You know what?</i>
<i>I really like the look of these guys.</i>

20:04.286 --> 20:06.246
<i>"These guys should be the creatures,</i>

20:06.330 --> 20:09.041
<i>"not so much the masks</i>
<i>that the Habooskan was wearing."</i>

20:09.208 --> 20:11.001
And I loved that.
I thought, you know, that's...

20:11.293 --> 20:14.004
For a creature design,
I'd never seen anything like these guys.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.803
Devastation all around.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.972
-Our temple's been destroyed.
-We're donating goats.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.516
Apparently we're still giving away stuff
'cause that...

20:26.600 --> 20:28.101
Yeah, that's kinda who we are.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.269
We have nothing else.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.354
We got nothing.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.232
We got no temple or anything,
but we're still giving away our goats.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.858
(GOATS SCREAMING)

20:35.484 --> 20:36.485
No backsies.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.240
This movie is introducing
two new unexpected characters

20:41.323 --> 20:44.993
<i>in Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder,</i>
<i>who are two space-travelling goats.</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:48.163
<i>There's a Viking ship</i>
<i>that floats through space</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:50.749
<i>that's being towed by giant goats</i>

20:50.832 --> 20:52.709
who create fire with their hooves.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.877
It's gonna be nuts.

20:53.961 --> 20:54.962
It's so good, right?

20:56.046 --> 20:58.131
Awesome. Really good.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.345
Really good, really good, yeah. Really.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.181
CHAPEK: <i>You would think something</i>
<i>like that would be completely CG,</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:08.767
<i>and you'd have no reference.</i>
<i>But we didn't do that.</i>

21:09.184 --> 21:10.227
It's very smooth.

21:10.310 --> 21:14.356
CHAPEK: We actually created real-life
goat heads for VFX reference,

21:14.439 --> 21:16.566
but more so
just to be able to interact with them.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.819
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:19.486 --> 21:20.487
That's really awesome.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.698
They're huge, these things.
They're the size of, you know,

21:22.781 --> 21:24.283
Clydesdale horses.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.744
This is Toothgrinder and Toothgnasher.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.455
<i>They were really the trickiest</i>
<i>thing we've done on this show.</i>

21:30.539 --> 21:32.249
<i>Coming up with the design that was</i>

21:32.332 --> 21:35.585
<i>true to some of the early</i>
<i>visual development art that we received,</i>

21:35.794 --> 21:39.923
but giving them the most realistic finish,
wanting them to look real.

21:40.465 --> 21:45.262
There's lot of designing, incredibly
detailed punched hair, silicon tongue,

21:45.971 --> 21:50.100
got acrylic eyes in here.
The horns are hard.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.270
Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder
are absolute stars.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.897
We loved writing for them.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.317
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.651
One of these goats probably ate it!

21:59.735 --> 22:01.611
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.906
One of things that
the goats are really helpful with

22:04.990 --> 22:08.243
is getting in and out of scenes
and infusing more fun into a movie

22:08.327 --> 22:10.746
that already is incredibly fun.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.957
<i>One of those scenes</i>
<i>was the Grand Pantheon,</i>

22:14.041 --> 22:16.376
<i>where we were like,</i>
<i>"How do we get in and out of this scene?</i>

22:16.460 --> 22:18.211
"What is the fantastical way out?"

22:22.007 --> 22:23.050
I did it.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.763
ROBINSON: <i>Well, what if the goats smashed</i>
<i>through the top of the Pantheon</i>

22:27.846 --> 22:30.057
<i>in the goat boat to save our heroes?</i>

22:30.557 --> 22:33.185
I don't know if that's possible,
'cause I come from small productions.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.729
But this is Marvel, so, we got to do that.

22:36.480 --> 22:40.692
Look up there. There's my god.
The God of Kronans. Ninny Nonnie.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.611
I thought he was actually not real.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.072
Oh, no,
they're all very real indeed, Korg.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.407
(LAUGHING) I'm so sorry.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.702
ROBINSON: <i>The Grand Pantheon is one of</i>
<i>the biggest set pieces in the film.</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:53.080
<i>It's full of gods</i>
<i>from all over the Cosmos.</i>

22:53.163 --> 22:58.126
<i>So, we also get to include a lot of gods</i>
<i>and people from other MCU favorites.</i>

22:58.210 --> 23:01.838
It's really about bringing
the whole MCU together in this one space

23:01.922 --> 23:03.715
and having our characters exist

23:03.799 --> 23:07.344
<i>and feel like they are truly</i>
<i>a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</i>

23:10.555 --> 23:12.808
So, now flick. Right, good.
Good stuff, yeah.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.102
But now you know
he's gonna step forward and...

23:15.185 --> 23:16.603
You flicked too hard, damn it!

23:16.728 --> 23:19.022
(SCREAMING)

23:19.689 --> 23:20.816
(LAUGHS)

23:21.358 --> 23:26.822
Makeup-wise, in the Golden Temple,
we had 18, 20 gods to create.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.240
I'm playing Fur God.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.201
Although he's dyslexic,
so he likes to be known as Fur Dog.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.287
I'm gonna be up there and I'm gonna be
in a little hole and I have my little...

23:34.371 --> 23:35.580
Of course, you can't see here,

23:35.664 --> 23:38.333
<i>but I have these little</i>
<i>furry feet-hands or hand-feet.</i>

23:38.417 --> 23:40.544
He's just gonna be chatting to Thor
about orgies and stuff.

23:45.257 --> 23:50.387
You can see the level of detail they did
on the face. It's just astonishing.

23:50.679 --> 23:55.642
My favorite one was the Aztec god.
He looks like a glass mosaic in his face.

23:55.725 --> 23:59.729
<i>He's got a suit. And then his face, hands,</i>
<i>and feet are painted.</i>

23:59.896 --> 24:02.732
And the other challenge was Dionysus.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.486
<i>Taika wanted Dionysus</i>
<i>to look like a marble statue.</i>

24:06.611 --> 24:08.780
<i>I was, like,</i>
<i>"Oh. How are we gonna do that?"</i>

24:08.864 --> 24:11.199
because they'd never done it
on a movie before.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.702
So, we said,
"Okay, let's try to do it."

24:14.286 --> 24:20.000
<i>We gave him a beard and he looked like,</i>
<i>with all these cracks from the marble,</i>

24:20.083 --> 24:21.626
and we made him like a...

24:22.544 --> 24:26.298
I hope he was gonna love it,
because it was perfect.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.383
Two things.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.510
Number one.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.806
I am so sorry to hear
of the death of your father.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.309
Number two...

24:37.392 --> 24:39.269
Don't talk back to Zeus!

24:40.562 --> 24:43.815
Zeus is a very powerful character
in the comics.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.401
<i>Someone that goes back with Thor</i>
<i>a long way.</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:48.111
<i>He's one of the most powerful gods.</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:49.613
And so, if you're gonna introduce Zeus,

24:49.696 --> 24:52.115
you need to introduce someone
who can walk those shoes.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.702
You! You are also uninvited to the orgy.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.787
In fact,

24:58.497 --> 25:02.292
all the emotion gods are banned. Okay?

25:02.375 --> 25:05.253
I've had enough.
You're too much hard work.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.589
Zeus, please, you must do something.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.592
My word is final!

25:10.675 --> 25:12.802
Zeus, you must listen to us.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.095
Okay.

25:14.179 --> 25:20.060
Russell Crowe came in to play Zeus,
and I am a massive Russell Crowe fan,

25:20.143 --> 25:22.729
<i>and he's now become a friend,</i>
<i>and he's really funny.</i>

25:22.812 --> 25:27.150
<i>He allowed himself to enjoy that role</i>
<i>and to have fun doing it.</i>

25:27.526 --> 25:30.320
I just never thought
I'd never see the day with him,

25:30.403 --> 25:34.741
<i>sort of semi-gladiator kind of imagery,</i>

25:34.824 --> 25:39.120
<i>yet just with a wink and totally</i>
<i>taking the piss out of himself.</i>

25:39.204 --> 25:42.290
<i>And self-deprecating</i>
<i>and didn't hold back either.</i>

25:42.749 --> 25:46.795
Which was mind-blowing, you know.
It was fantastic.

25:46.920 --> 25:52.759
I think we're so used to him
in these very strong, heroic roles.

25:52.842 --> 25:56.054
So it's fun to see him
be able to let loose.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.682
My hero, Zeus...

25:58.765 --> 25:59.766
afraid.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.601
(GODS GASP)

26:03.061 --> 26:06.648
THOMPSON: <i>I never thought I would</i>
<i>see Russell Crowe in a tennis skirt.</i>

26:06.982 --> 26:10.151
That's been a real joy.
It's been real nice to see.

26:10.235 --> 26:15.949
Like, I... Sometimes he walks past
my trailer in the tennis skirt.

26:16.116 --> 26:19.369
<i>And his perfectly curled, coifed hair.</i>

26:19.452 --> 26:23.123
<i>Basically, they did</i>
<i>a really fantastic job outfitting Russell.</i>

26:23.206 --> 26:25.625
What about the others? Eh?

26:25.750 --> 26:28.920
Russell said, "You guys are gonna
be too busy to look after me.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.549
"So, let's make it easy. Let's choose
my own hair and my own beard."

26:33.049 --> 26:37.554
<i>And we ended up using it, because he had</i>
<i>really long hair and a really long beard.</i>

26:37.637 --> 26:40.056
<i>So, what we did is, we styled that.</i>

26:40.140 --> 26:44.394
<i>I made all these curls and fixed it</i>
<i>to make sure it stay all day.</i>

26:44.811 --> 26:48.189
And it looked great.
He was a great Zeus.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.899
Yes!

26:49.983 --> 26:51.776
(GODS CHEERING)

26:52.485 --> 26:54.029
ZEUS: Zeus!

26:54.112 --> 26:56.323
Yes! Thunderbolt!

26:59.159 --> 27:00.160
(WHOOPING)

27:01.161 --> 27:03.622
This is the hero Thunderbolt, which...

27:03.913 --> 27:06.625
This went through many design iterations.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.920
We have two different sizes,
depending on the character who's using it.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.673
We have multiple finishes.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.885
We have foam, soft, cut-off ones

27:16.968 --> 27:19.971
<i>for when they're doing action</i>
<i>and they can't actually throw this at all.</i>

27:20.055 --> 27:21.723
Can we just have the...

27:21.806 --> 27:25.352
Bill? Can we just have the short?
I don't want him to poke himself.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.811
Yeah.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.438
Thank you very much.

27:28.521 --> 27:31.608
No. It's getting better,
so we might not need it.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.692
That's a good thing.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.195
WILSON: <i>We have a magnetic version.</i>

27:35.278 --> 27:39.491
<i>So the actors can strap it to their back</i>
<i>with a magnetic plate.</i>

27:39.908 --> 27:43.953
<i>This prop is</i>
<i>a very multi-use lightning bolt</i>

27:44.037 --> 27:48.375
which took a lot of consideration
to figure out all its forms,

27:48.458 --> 27:53.546
including one where the entire
lightning bolt lights up from the inside.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.175
Ding! If you look in closely,
you can see some of the pixels.

27:57.258 --> 28:01.262
But it's just not quite as dotty
as the normal stuff that you come across.

28:01.554 --> 28:05.266
WILSON: <i>The action of this prop,</i>
<i>when they use it, it turns into lightning.</i>

28:09.771 --> 28:15.235
For us, it's been a feat where we're
creating a lot of props that are soft.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.530
Soft enough that
the stunt people can use them,

28:18.613 --> 28:23.368
because most of the action, when it's
meant to light up, occurs during stunts.

28:23.451 --> 28:27.080
MAN: On go. And three, two, one, go!

28:27.163 --> 28:28.707
(ALL GRUNTING)

28:33.002 --> 28:36.965
WILSON: <i>We'll cast it out of a softer</i>
<i>silicon that we can, or rubber,</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:39.092
<i>or sometimes even a foam,</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:44.514
<i>and then inside is a strip of LEDs</i>
<i>that is remotely operated,</i>

28:44.597 --> 28:47.934
<i>so that the silicon prop can light up,</i>

28:48.017 --> 28:52.397
<i>and they can use an actual lit version of</i>
<i>this prop while they're fighting on set.</i>

28:53.231 --> 28:54.774
Lead your army to that axe.

28:55.316 --> 28:56.818
We shall do our worst.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.361
(YELLING)

29:10.290 --> 29:14.669
-Yeah, so I pull...
-Remember the... About the...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.713
CHAPEK: <i>There are so many amazing looks</i>
<i>in this movie,</i>

29:16.796 --> 29:19.716
and I think that's a big opportunity
for us in these <i>Thor</i> films,

29:19.799 --> 29:21.593
is to see Thor evolve,

29:21.676 --> 29:24.095
not only as a character, but his looks.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.890
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

29:27.432 --> 29:29.142
-All right.
-MAN: Walk back.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.393
SILVI: <i>New thing that we did,</i>

29:30.477 --> 29:35.023
<i>he takes all his clothes off,</i>
<i>and you find him completely naked,</i>

29:35.315 --> 29:38.276
and he's got his back covered in tattoos.

29:38.985 --> 29:44.157
And he's got all these tattoos that he did
after Loki died, his brother.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.117
It's almost too perfect.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.286
This will feel a little bit more like,

29:48.828 --> 29:51.372
jail type that's been done
by a bunch of different people.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.209
SILVI: <i>Some of them</i>
<i>have been designed by Taika.</i>

29:54.626 --> 29:55.919
<i>Literally drawn.</i>

29:56.544 --> 29:58.087
It was cool. It was nice just to...

29:58.171 --> 30:00.340
I think, again,
you have to do something different.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.424
Flick.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.683
You flicked too hard, damn it!

30:11.226 --> 30:13.436
There are more costume changes in this
than I think I've had

30:13.895 --> 30:15.563
in the last six films combined.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.065
MAN: Up there, please.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.818
HEMSWORTH: <i>All the montage stuff,</i>
<i>all the flashbacks.</i>

30:19.901 --> 30:22.111
MAN: Stand by to shoot, please.
Ready, ready.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.698
This is not acceptable behavior.
You wear whatever you want.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.742
However, don't come complaining to me
when your feet get sore.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.035
You'll get no sympathy from me.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.662
(LAUGHING)

30:31.162 --> 30:32.372
I don't like all of them,

30:33.289 --> 30:35.458
as far as comfort goes,
but this is actually really good.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.169
It's got this wetsuit material in here.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.631
Sometimes, that's real hard plastic,
and it chews your arm apart.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.301
-How does it feel to be back in the armor?
-That's what I just said, Dan.

30:46.845 --> 30:52.433
Due to Thor's uncertainty in who he is
and searching for his identity...

30:52.642 --> 30:55.562
(CHUCKLES) that's represented
in his wardrobe as well.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.063
-Keep pushing.
-(LAUGHS)

30:57.689 --> 30:59.065
Feels good to be back in the suit.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.401
(EXHALES) Just burning a few calories.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.613
Nothing. Nothing holds him back.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.368
-Okay
-Here? Yeah.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.833
RUBEO: I think we should
do inhale, exhale.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.002
-Like expand the...
-MAN: Yeah, expand...

31:19.085 --> 31:21.880
Yeah, I just... I'm...

WOMAN: Okay, yeah.
Take a deep breath. So 40...

31:25.425 --> 31:30.513
I should know how many costumes I've made
for Thor, but I really lost track of it.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.849
Right, how many changes
do we have in this movie? 20...

31:32.932 --> 31:33.933
MAN: Twenty-four.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.228
Twenty-four different
clothing outfit changes.

31:39.606 --> 31:44.944
We have, for instance, five main changes.
One of them being extreme Thor.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.698
His looks progressively get bigger
and more bold,

31:48.781 --> 31:50.909
and when The Mighty Thor enters his life,

31:50.992 --> 31:53.411
<i>he has to take on</i>
<i>his most extreme look yet,</i>

31:53.494 --> 31:56.873
<i>and so he dons this amazing,</i>
<i>over-the-top armor.</i>

31:56.956 --> 31:59.042
<i>Head to toe in gold and blue.</i>

31:59.125 --> 32:01.794
<i>Really kind of harkening back</i>
<i>to the original comics</i>

32:01.878 --> 32:04.380
<i>where they didn't hold back</i>
<i>in terms of the fun and the colors.</i>

32:04.547 --> 32:06.090
Why are we taking this helmet off?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.843
With the gold helmet,
it's this narrative that

32:09.135 --> 32:14.432
Thor, maybe, has gone a little too far in
his costume because of those insecurities.

32:14.641 --> 32:18.186
<i>And it's that kind of storytelling that</i>
<i>we're trying to convey in our designs.</i>

32:18.269 --> 32:19.896
-Jane?
-(ALL LAUGHING)

32:19.979 --> 32:20.980
What is...

32:21.064 --> 32:25.276
Chris Hemsworth is very involved
in terms of functionality.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.819
<i>We have to ensure...</i>

32:27.153 --> 32:28.488
(CACKLES)

32:29.489 --> 32:32.408
<i>...that he has an armor that he can manage</i>

32:32.492 --> 32:36.287
<i>in all the very intense actions</i>
<i>that he goes through the movie.</i>

32:36.829 --> 32:39.082
-Yeah.
-Maybe in the Bifrost, it's just gone.

32:39.165 --> 32:41.626
Maybe everything will be ripped off
and you come into this place naked.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.670
Yeah, that's good. Yeah, let's do that.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.673
THOMPSON: <i>I think the most rewarding</i>
<i>part of working with Chris on this film</i>

32:46.756 --> 32:51.386
has been how big he is now.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.722
<i>I'm like, "How did you do it?"</i>

32:54.806 --> 32:57.100
<i>I thought when we made the last movie,</i>

32:57.183 --> 33:01.312
<i>that he was the largest human</i>
<i>that I have spent time with.</i>

33:01.896 --> 33:03.940
<i>And now he's bigger than that.</i>

33:04.023 --> 33:07.694
WINDERBAUM: <i>He was in a otherworldly</i>
<i>physique when he showed up to set.</i>

33:07.777 --> 33:10.321
The most insane shape you've ever seen.

33:13.282 --> 33:16.703
THOMPSON: <i>It really is inspiring because</i>
<i>he just works really, really hard.</i>

33:18.871 --> 33:21.207
HEMSWORTH: <i>Each time</i>
<i>I've played the character</i>

33:21.290 --> 33:23.126
<i>and put the muscle on and put the size on,</i>

33:23.209 --> 33:26.421
<i>and then lost it for something else</i>
<i>and played another character,</i>

33:27.088 --> 33:30.717
<i>there's muscle memory, and I used to say</i>
<i>it sort of got easier each time.</i>

33:30.842 --> 33:31.968
Push!

33:32.051 --> 33:33.428
<i>This was particularly hard.</i>

33:33.511 --> 33:37.306
I think because
the target weight we aimed for was...

33:37.849 --> 33:39.976
quite a ways above where I'd been before.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.942
We had 12 months when I was at home,
just training

33:48.026 --> 33:53.239
and sort of, you know,
puppeteering the body and manipulating

33:53.322 --> 33:57.118
and trying to like, we could try more
swimming now or try more martial arts.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.540
<i>It was a really fun exploration,</i>

34:02.707 --> 34:05.126
<i>but I don't know that</i>
<i>I wanna get that big again.</i>

34:05.543 --> 34:07.503
-Let me see what...
-I told you, though, no more secrets.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.630
<i>But I was sort of...</i>

34:10.423 --> 34:12.550
It was... Yeah, it was just exhausting.

34:12.633 --> 34:16.596
<i>I don't know, maybe I'm getting old,</i>
<i>but things just started to hurt more.</i>

34:19.474 --> 34:20.808
GARDINER: <i>A lot of difficulties too</i>

34:20.892 --> 34:23.352
because to carry that sort of size,

34:23.436 --> 34:24.812
the physics of things changes.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.732
<i>So the action has to progress with it.</i>

34:28.399 --> 34:30.026
<i>You just have to adapt and...</i>

34:30.109 --> 34:33.946
<i>It's just making sure the range of motion</i>
<i>is still good and things like that.</i>

34:34.655 --> 34:36.866
BALE: <i>Talking with Chris as Thor,</i>

34:37.241 --> 34:40.828
I remember thinking that he must be
on a few steps above me

34:40.912 --> 34:43.956
and then realizing,
no, we're on the same level.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.708
<i>And I was still doing that...</i>

34:45.792 --> 34:49.962
<i>And ridiculously good guy</i>
<i>and absolutely fantastic at this.</i>

34:50.046 --> 34:52.632
And so much easier to play the villain
than it is to play the hero.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.841
I had the easy role.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.510
Yeah, Chris had the tough role.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.099
PORTMAN: <i>It's just incredible</i>
<i>to watch Chris' talent.</i>

35:01.474 --> 35:04.018
<i>He's just so agile</i>

35:04.477 --> 35:08.898
with moving from serious scenes to,
of course, extreme comedy.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.441
Great to meet you.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.443
We've met before, but, okay.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.528
Great to...

35:14.070 --> 35:15.071
Oh, I see.

35:15.655 --> 35:18.491
What a lot of people said about
the first time is that it was so fast

35:18.574 --> 35:20.743
that a lot of people didn't even
know we were in the movie.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.538
-Can you guys shut up?
-(DAMON AND LUKE LAUGHING)

35:23.621 --> 35:24.997

Dear Thor, son of Odin,

35:27.834 --> 35:32.463
may you maketh the shooteth and dayeth
wonderful and positiveth.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.175
He has such a quick brain for

35:36.717 --> 35:38.970
changing things, assimilating information,

35:39.053 --> 35:41.764
reacting in a creative way,

35:42.056 --> 35:43.432
coming up with new ideas.

35:43.516 --> 35:44.517
Can you see me?

35:45.309 --> 35:47.478
Yes, I can see you.
But where's the rest of your body?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.063
Did he cut off your head?

35:49.188 --> 35:51.732
PORTMAN: <i>I always have to remind myself</i>
<i>that I have to act in the scene</i>

35:51.816 --> 35:53.109

35:54.485 --> 35:56.195
-Let's go.
-THOMPSON: You don't ha...

Getting to see someone

35:59.282 --> 36:04.704
but is constantly reimagining
what this character can be

36:06.747 --> 36:09.041
<i>is exquisite to work alongside,</i>

36:09.125 --> 36:11.252
<i>with someone that cares so much</i>
<i>about what they do</i>

36:11.335 --> 36:13.171
<i>and cares so much about a character,</i>

36:13.254 --> 36:17.133

36:31.856 --> 36:33.316
I'm an artist, stay away from me.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.401
This would be one that we give to Chris

36:35.484 --> 36:39.739
<i>when we want him to have that</i>
<i>real powerful, godly look about him.</i>

36:39.822 --> 36:43.159
But some of the action
requires it to be much lighter,

36:43.242 --> 36:44.869
so then we'll have this version.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.954
Much lighter weight, but...

36:48.789 --> 36:49.790
<i>photo-real.</i>

36:50.499 --> 36:52.001
<i>Almost identical,</i>

36:52.084 --> 36:54.128
which is quite a feat.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.631
And we have some
very talented painters here

<i>turn any material</i>

36:59.592 --> 37:01.719
into something that looks amazing.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.306
As you can see, this is rubber,
but it looks just like metal.

<i>on</i> Thor: Love and Thunder.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.313
<i>Obviously, New Asgard behind me</i>

37:12.396 --> 37:15.566

<i>just south of the city in Sydney.</i>

37:22.323 --> 37:23.574
<i>And it was on some cliffs</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:28.204
<i>so we had phenomenal water</i>
<i>and winds blowing in.</i>

37:29.789 --> 37:30.790
Join me or die.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.000
-Never!
-We will never join you, witch.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.586
It was challenging with the wind.

Shooting with large lighting units

37:39.006 --> 37:42.760
<i>or different aerial things that need to</i>
<i>get up and not be affected by the wind.</i>

37:43.135 --> 37:45.054
<i>It was ultimately absolutely rewarding</i>

it couldn't be more different.

And what we're doing...
So what are we doing?

38:07.076 --> 38:08.786
What are we doing today? Well, we're...

38:09.662 --> 38:10.663
This is a flashback.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.499
Basically, this is the
origin story of Gorr, the villain.

Not that, but this is
just here for the camera.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.437

<i>has a history of</i>

38:34.979 --> 38:37.106
<i>producing some</i>
<i>pretty interesting villains.</i>

38:38.399 --> 38:39.859
THOR: <i>Why have you done this?</i>

38:39.942 --> 38:42.945
To prove to Father that I am a worthy son.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.365
<i>Hela is one of our best.</i>

38:46.741 --> 38:49.410
So it was very important
for us to introduce

38:49.493 --> 38:51.037
<i>another terrifying villain,</i>

38:51.120 --> 38:53.247
<i>and we found that</i>

<i>I've worked with so many people,</i>

every now and again, you sort of...

40:06.570 --> 40:08.155
Someone just...
It's like a slap in the face.

40:10.449 --> 40:12.159
<i>He added so many more layers to it</i>

40:12.493 --> 40:14.412
<i>and depth to it, which then,</i>

40:14.745 --> 40:16.664
just made me think even harder about,

40:16.747 --> 40:19.125
okay, what is Thor's point of view here

40:19.208 --> 40:22.128
<i>besides just marching off to save the day,</i>

40:22.586 --> 40:25.673
<i>and it not being as simple as</i>
<i>the villain and the hero.</i>

40:25.756 --> 40:27.425
<i>It was a lot more complex than that.</i>

40:33.889 --> 40:34.890
Protect her.

that your villainry comes from pain,

comes from some trauma
that you haven't processed.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.487
we would've lost all of Christian.

just how scary he is,

42:09.235 --> 42:11.362
color of the practical paint we gave him,

42:11.445 --> 42:13.656
<i>the scars and these amazing tattoos</i>

42:13.739 --> 42:15.991
<i>indicative and representative of his past.</i>

<i>shoulder to hands, chest, down his back.</i>

Head shave, arm shave, pit shave,

42:35.177 --> 42:36.178
face shave,

42:36.262 --> 42:39.848
and then it's, yeah,
straight into coloration

42:41.100 --> 42:43.227
and laying down all the different...

42:43.310 --> 42:45.020
The tattoos go on first

42:45.104 --> 42:47.565

goes over the top of that.

Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

43:10.170 --> 43:12.214
That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.551
What's a Necrosword?

43:15.634 --> 43:18.637
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed

43:36.030 --> 43:39.617

20 designs of swords,

<i>and it came down to what</i>
<i>Taika envisioned for this character,</i>

43:42.786 --> 43:44.538
<i>and this is where we landed.</i>

43:44.872 --> 43:46.624
Lots of little bits that we have to get,

43:46.707 --> 43:49.668
including establishing this Necrosword

43:49.752 --> 43:52.546
and Gorr being infected by the Necrosword.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.465

Funny.

WILSON: <i>Once we land on a design,</i>
<i>we have someone 3D model it</i>

44:04.558 --> 44:08.854

a version that is aluminum.

It's got a solid tip
and it's a little bit heavier.

44:13.525 --> 44:14.943
You can... Feels like a real...

44:15.027 --> 44:17.488
You know, it's got a good weight
to the sword.

44:17.946 --> 44:20.074
And then this one, they...

44:20.157 --> 44:22.701
Basically, they mold it
and cast it out of rubber.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.662
It still has an armature inside,

44:24.745 --> 44:27.331
<i>but you'll see that</i>
<i>it's flexible and bendy.</i>

44:27.539 --> 44:28.624
Do we need one more?

44:28.707 --> 44:29.708
MAN: Yeah.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.168
WAITITI: Different pose with the sword.

44:32.544 --> 44:34.046
Yeah, get the strong sword, eh?

44:43.263 --> 44:46.642
<i>All of Christian's shadow demons</i>
<i>that he makes, he conjures up...</i>

44:46.725 --> 44:49.144
When I was writing the script,
my daughter was...

44:50.270 --> 44:51.730
looking over my shoulders, and she's...

44:51.814 --> 44:53.982
I was writing down ideas for monsters,

44:54.066 --> 44:56.068
and I didn't really know
what they might be

44:56.151 --> 44:58.028
<i>and I wrote down "shadow monster."</i>

44:58.278 --> 45:00.948
<i>And she goes, "What's a shadow monster?"</i>
<i>and I was like, "I have no idea."</i>

45:01.365 --> 45:02.700
<i>I was writing something and she goes,</i>

45:02.783 --> 45:04.493
"What's it look like?"
I was like, "I don't know."

45:04.576 --> 45:06.036
So she goes,
"We should draw something."

45:06.120 --> 45:07.830
I went, "Yeah, yeah." And so she drew...

45:08.330 --> 45:11.041
<i>just this weird, freaky,</i>
<i>snake-like creature</i>

45:11.125 --> 45:14.294
<i>with a giant mouth and three eyes,</i>
<i>and it was covered in spikes.</i>

45:15.045 --> 45:19.383
Then I had this idea, what if we got
the visual development artists

45:20.092 --> 45:23.512
to take kids' drawings
of what they think is scary

45:23.887 --> 45:25.222
and turn them into real...

45:26.432 --> 45:29.059
monsters, and put those in the film?

45:29.309 --> 45:30.477
<i>And so that's what we did.</i>

45:30.561 --> 45:31.895
<i>So all of our kids just basically,</i>

45:32.020 --> 45:34.690
<i>drew pictures and we've designed...</i>

45:34.773 --> 45:37.025
<i>all of the monsters around those drawings.</i>

45:37.526 --> 45:40.237
<i>So, even that stuff was insane and...</i>

45:41.321 --> 45:42.823
I mean, on paper, it just shouldn't work.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.424
MAN: <i>It's a family affair</i>
<i>for everybody's kids, it's so cute.</i>

46:04.636 --> 46:07.055
He refused to be
in the scene with me as Gorr

46:07.139 --> 46:08.974
'cause he said it was too...

46:09.057 --> 46:10.392
It will give him nightmares.

MAN 2: Let's roll cameras, please.

46:15.397 --> 46:17.983
ROBINSON: <i>The Moon of Shame is one</i>
<i>of my favorite sequences in the movie</i>

46:18.066 --> 46:20.277
because we get this
amazing fight sequence.

46:24.656 --> 46:27.075
It's like... utter disconnect.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.455
I think that... You know, how do you
reinvent fight sequences in the MCU?

46:31.538 --> 46:33.916
How do you create something
that people haven't seen before?

46:33.999 --> 46:35.501
And you play with zero-G.

46:35.584 --> 46:37.336
You play with a really small moon

46:37.503 --> 46:39.838
<i>and a bunch of heroes</i>
<i>and a bunch of shadow monsters,</i>

46:39.922 --> 46:42.758
<i>and also everything is topsy turvy</i>
<i>and turning upside down.</i>

46:43.509 --> 46:45.761
-(YELLING)
-(GRUNTS)

46:47.054 --> 46:49.056
GARDINER: <i>We always like to try</i>
<i>and reinvent the wheel,</i>

46:49.139 --> 46:50.349
<i>but sometimes it's not possible,</i>

46:50.432 --> 46:52.267
but you like to push the boundaries.

46:52.851 --> 46:53.852
(LAUGHS)

46:54.269 --> 46:56.396
Somebody's gonna come on down there,
but we're not going.

46:57.564 --> 46:59.441
GARDINER: <i>But it has to fit in</i>
<i>with the story.</i>

46:59.525 --> 47:01.527
<i>I think it's always, with Taika,</i>

47:01.610 --> 47:03.737
<i>very character-driven and story-driven.</i>

47:03.821 --> 47:05.739
<i>It's not action for the sake of action.</i>

47:06.365 --> 47:10.118
We always try to design things
that keeps the story moving forward

47:10.202 --> 47:11.495
and the characters moving forward.

47:11.578 --> 47:12.996
So I think a lot of it was there.

47:13.413 --> 47:14.414
MAN: Go!

47:17.417 --> 47:19.294
GARDINER: <i>The anti-gravity sequence</i>
<i>on Moon of Shame</i>

47:19.378 --> 47:22.881
<i>and the lighting rig they used</i>
<i>for that sequence is pretty special.</i>

47:23.340 --> 47:25.342
I think the single biggest challenge

47:25.425 --> 47:29.096
from a creative and technical point
of view will probably be the lighting.

47:31.265 --> 47:32.766
If you bake the lighting in,

47:32.850 --> 47:35.018
if you make a very strong choice
on an actor

47:35.102 --> 47:38.355
<i>and you put the lighting on them</i>
<i>from a particular angle, that's all it is.</i>

47:38.438 --> 47:40.774
That drives a lot of the reasons
why many

47:41.567 --> 47:42.734
films that you see

47:43.193 --> 47:44.403
will often have...

47:45.237 --> 47:46.405
slightly non-committal lighting.

47:46.697 --> 47:50.158
<i>Because you don't know quite when</i>
<i>that shot's gonna be used in the edit.</i>

47:50.701 --> 47:51.952
<i>And that's true, dramatically,</i>

47:52.035 --> 47:55.539
<i>and it's incredibly true</i>
<i>when it comes to action sequences.</i>

47:57.791 --> 48:00.711
<i>When Taika told me that he wanted</i>
<i>to shoot this Moon of Shame piece...</i>

48:01.044 --> 48:03.589
<i>The Moon of Shame</i>
<i>is an embarrassingly small asteroid.</i>

48:03.672 --> 48:05.340
<i>It's kind of...</i>
<i>What I would describe it as.</i>

48:05.424 --> 48:08.427
<i>Like you had some popcorn</i>
<i>just after eating chewing gum.</i>

48:08.510 --> 48:11.513
<i>It's just like this wad of horrible stuff</i>
<i>that's just stuck in space.</i>

48:11.930 --> 48:13.599
<i>But the crazy thing</i>
<i>about the Moon of Shame</i>

48:13.682 --> 48:15.559
<i>is that one day is six minutes.</i>

48:15.809 --> 48:18.020
So, from dawn to dawn again,
it's six minutes.

48:18.103 --> 48:20.480
So when you stick actors there,
the light's gotta move.

48:22.774 --> 48:25.110
<i>You've got this continuing cycle,</i>

48:25.193 --> 48:27.446
<i>so it's spinning and spinning,</i>
<i>the backgrounds are wheeling.</i>

48:27.571 --> 48:28.739
<i>There's all sorts of craziness.</i>

48:28.822 --> 48:31.950
<i>So I was trying to work out</i>
<i>how we could find a way to</i>

48:32.034 --> 48:35.412
be able to shoot with
strong directional, interesting light,

48:35.495 --> 48:39.541
but also maintain the creative freedom
that we needed later on

48:39.625 --> 48:41.501
<i>to be able to</i>
<i>actually stitch all this together.</i>

48:41.585 --> 48:43.545
<i>'Cause you think</i>
<i>the shot goes there in continuity,</i>

48:43.629 --> 48:44.630
<i>it's actually going there.</i>

48:44.713 --> 48:46.506
<i>Films change an awful lot</i>
<i>when you get into post.</i>

48:46.590 --> 48:49.176
So we roped in
our friends from Satellite Labs

48:49.259 --> 48:52.095
and we found an application
for this new technology called PlateLight.

48:53.347 --> 48:56.558
This is the largest scale version
of PlateLight that we've built.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.519
And it's the first time in cinema history
it's been used.

48:59.770 --> 49:00.771
<i>Lighting with one.</i>

49:01.605 --> 49:03.440
<i>Keeps playing, that's lighting with two.</i>

49:03.607 --> 49:07.861
PlateLight is a way of filming multiple
lighting looks all at the same time

49:07.945 --> 49:09.112
on the same camera.

49:09.404 --> 49:10.530
<i>But out of the camera,</i>

49:10.614 --> 49:13.075
<i>we get each lighting look</i>
<i>as a separate piece of footage.</i>

49:14.034 --> 49:15.452
WAITITI: <i>At the end of the day,</i>

49:15.535 --> 49:18.121
<i>I can choose the lighting</i>
<i>in postproduction that I want.</i>

49:18.205 --> 49:20.332
<i>So I can blend lighting,</i>
<i>I can color time it.</i>

49:20.415 --> 49:23.794
I can have all of the lights behind them,
or all of that in front of them.

49:23.877 --> 49:25.671
<i>We get to make that decision later on.</i>

49:25.754 --> 49:28.465
So it's pretty new and amazing,

49:28.548 --> 49:30.592
and no one has done it before in a film.

49:32.260 --> 49:34.388
And so I'm excited about it. Okay?

49:37.307 --> 49:40.560
ROBINSON: <i>I think the biggest challenge</i>
<i>in writing a script like this,</i>

49:40.644 --> 49:42.270
<i>from writing</i>

49:42.354 --> 49:44.648
<i>has just been wanting to balance the tone.</i>
