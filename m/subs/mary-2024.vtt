00:19.667 --> 00:21.667
[wind whooshing continues]

00:29.333 --> 00:32.625
[ominous music]

00:47.833 --> 00:50.667
[ominous music intensifies]

00:50.750 --> 00:52.875

00:53.375 --> 00:56.375
[suspenseful percussive music]

01:14.125 --> 01:15.375
[horse whinnies]

01:17.375 --> 01:20.208
[Mary] I was chosen
to deliver a gift to the world.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.667
The greatest gift it has ever known.

01:29.375 --> 01:31.208
You may think you know my story.

01:31.917 --> 01:32.917
Trust me,

01:33.958 --> 01:34.958
you don't.

01:47.250 --> 01:51.417
[breathing heavily]

01:56.875 --> 01:59.875
[Mary]
My father, Joachim, withdrew to the desert

01:59.958 --> 02:02.375
for 40 days of fasting and repentance,

02:02.917 --> 02:05.625
believing the Lord
denied him a child as punishment.

02:07.375 --> 02:10.417
My mother, Anne,
prayed fervently for a child.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.542
[murmuring prayer]

02:27.750 --> 02:30.750
[crickets chirping]

[panting steadily]

02:54.292 --> 02:56.292
[grunting]

02:58.292 --> 03:00.500
How did I offend you, my Lord?

03:01.458 --> 03:03.708
All I want is a child.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.250
[breathing shakily]

03:08.333 --> 03:09.833
[man] He hears you.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.458
[startled breaths]

03:14.542 --> 03:18.708
[wind whistling loudly]

03:18.792 --> 03:21.375
Who are you? How did you get here?

03:23.375 --> 03:24.917
I am Gabriel.

03:25.958 --> 03:28.750
God will gift you with a daughter.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.125
A d-- A daughter?

03:40.708 --> 03:43.333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.583
A daughter?

03:48.667 --> 03:50.125
-Yes.
-[weeps]

03:50.208 --> 03:52.292
He will gift you a daughter

03:53.292 --> 03:55.875
unlike any other.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.625
She will fulfill Isaiah's prophecy.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.792
And in exchange…

04:04.875 --> 04:06.625
Yes, what is it?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.125
A promise.

04:11.708 --> 04:16.167
When I return, you must dedicate her
to the service of God.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.542
To dwell in His temple.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.875
[praying softly]

-[muffled thud]

04:59.458 --> 05:01.458
[Joachim breathing shakily]

05:11.250 --> 05:12.292
[relieved laughter]

05:12.375 --> 05:13.792
-[Joachim] Anne.
-[Anne laughs]

05:13.875 --> 05:14.875
Joachim!

05:14.958 --> 05:16.958
[giggles]

05:17.042 --> 05:17.875
[Joachim] Anne.

05:18.708 --> 05:19.917
[Anne laughs]

05:21.583 --> 05:23.333
Our prayers have been answered.

05:23.417 --> 05:26.250
[Anne sighs and laughs]

05:27.833 --> 05:28.833
[muffled] Joachim.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.542
[birds cawing]

05:45.375 --> 05:46.667
[sighs happily]

05:48.042 --> 05:50.042
[birds cawing]

05:50.833 --> 05:54.292
[Mary] The Romans appointed
King Herod to reign over Judea.

05:55.292 --> 05:59.375
Herod's tyrannical rule
sparked an uprising amongst the Judeans.

06:03.542 --> 06:06.042
I never imagined
our two worlds would collide.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.667
[scepter thudding]

06:09.208 --> 06:12.292
[brooding suspenseful music]

06:15.083 --> 06:17.083
[Herod coughs]

06:20.083 --> 06:22.375
[scepter thudding]

06:22.458 --> 06:23.375
My people…

06:25.708 --> 06:27.333
citizens of Jerusalem,

06:28.458 --> 06:33.167
I plan to rebuild
and enlarge the Second Temple

06:34.042 --> 06:37.250
to a splendor of magnificence
never before imagined.

06:37.958 --> 06:43.333
And I will embrace the troubles
and the pain that will assault me,

06:43.417 --> 06:47.333
and I will embrace them
as levies of greatness.

06:47.417 --> 06:51.500
The pain the hand of eternity
has set upon me.

06:52.292 --> 06:53.625
With this temple,

06:54.333 --> 06:58.042
I make full return to God.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.000
[men chanting]

07:02.083 --> 07:04.833
[Herod]
For his bounteous gift to me of this,

07:04.917 --> 07:09.333
his holy kingdom of Judea.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.292
[indistinct shouts and chatter]

07:16.375 --> 07:18.542
[metallic hammering]

07:18.625 --> 07:21.458
[scepter thudding]

07:22.750 --> 07:24.000
Your king,

07:25.917 --> 07:30.292
I, Herod, King of all the Jews.

07:31.667 --> 07:34.250
[indistinct chatter]

07:34.333 --> 07:37.500
[man] We must no longer
tolerate this injustice.

07:37.583 --> 07:41.000
Listen to me! Is it time to take action!

07:41.083 --> 07:42.583
[indistinct chatter]

07:42.667 --> 07:48.500
This temple is a monument to Herod's
vanity and desire for Roman approval.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.833
Though he claims to honor God,
he is just a puppet of Rome

07:51.917 --> 07:54.292
who shed Jewish blood to gain his throne.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.250
He is not even a Jew!

07:56.333 --> 08:00.583
How could Judaism ever be restored
under Herod's illegitimate reign?

08:01.500 --> 08:04.167
We must follow Aristobulus,
the high priest.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.167
He will lead us back to God.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.667
[chains rattle]

08:11.875 --> 08:14.458
These are trying times for us all.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.083
In the face of adversity,

08:16.167 --> 08:19.333
the divine providence of God
will serve a greater purpose.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.292
[door closes]

08:28.125 --> 08:31.583
Aristobulus, you must go into hiding.

08:31.667 --> 08:34.542
I have our people's support, sister.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.500
I assure you we are strong.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.417
No.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.708
Things have changed.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.208
[yells and grunts]

08:44.250 --> 08:45.958
[yelling]

08:49.042 --> 08:49.875
[yells]

08:50.500 --> 08:51.333
Please!

08:51.417 --> 08:53.125
[pained moans]

08:56.875 --> 08:57.917
Please!

09:07.000 --> 09:08.417
My little sparrow.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.417
My love.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.500
[knocking at door]

09:14.708 --> 09:15.542
Thank you.

09:17.083 --> 09:17.917
[lock clicks]

09:18.750 --> 09:19.833
[Herod] You look troubled.

09:21.542 --> 09:22.958
What ails you, my queen?

09:24.125 --> 09:25.833
You don't remember who I am.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.667
[laughs]

09:28.750 --> 09:30.333
Yes, I remember who you are.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.292
You helped me build
the many glories of this kingdom.

09:35.167 --> 09:38.000
You gave me
many beautiful Hasmonean children.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.583
You will always have my heart, Mariamne.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.375
Let us drink to

09:52.292 --> 09:53.750
our long,

09:54.875 --> 09:57.083
insufferable marriage.

10:02.958 --> 10:03.792
Pray,

10:04.917 --> 10:06.500
share the news.

10:09.000 --> 10:09.958
Yes.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.333
Your brother has been dealt with.

10:14.417 --> 10:15.583
[grunts]

10:21.833 --> 10:23.000
You…

10:23.917 --> 10:25.208
…are a monster.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.625
Yes.

10:26.708 --> 10:29.417
Someday, this madness will end…

10:29.500 --> 10:30.708
-Yes.
-…and we will restore

10:30.792 --> 10:31.917
the throne of David.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.958
-[pained cry]
-[blade plunging]

10:35.292 --> 10:36.667
Be still, my love.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.292
Mariamne.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.667

12:35.375 --> 12:37.333
[Joachim]
Careful not to bruise them, Malachi.

12:37.417 --> 12:38.292
[Malachi] Of course, sir.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.917
Each olive is a kiss from God.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.583
Don't you forget it, my friend.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.375
-[boy] Mary!
-[Anne] Mary!

12:45.458 --> 12:47.042
[indistinct chatter]

12:47.125 --> 12:49.333
Where did she run off to this time?

12:50.875 --> 12:52.083
[boy] Mary!

12:53.417 --> 12:55.417
[Mary laughing]

12:56.625 --> 12:57.583
Come here!

12:58.500 --> 12:59.750
Don't fly away!

12:59.833 --> 13:01.083

-[boy] Mary!
-[Anne] Mary!

13:05.875 --> 13:09.292
-[boy] Mary!
-[Anne] Where are you?

13:10.250 --> 13:11.875
-[Anne] I brought you a friend!
-[boy] Mary!

13:13.333 --> 13:14.417
Noam!

13:16.375 --> 13:19.000
Noam wants to play with you
while your fathers talk.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.542
Come on. I want to show you something.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.000
Keep your ears open for lunch!

13:22.083 --> 13:23.125
[Mary] Hurry up, Noam!

13:23.208 --> 13:24.750
Do you hear me, Mary?

13:24.833 --> 13:25.958
[chuckles]

13:26.042 --> 13:29.333
[both giggling]

13:30.042 --> 13:32.292
Come on, Noam! You're too slow.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.333
You're too fast. Wait!

13:34.417 --> 13:36.625
Come on. Let's pick some figs.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.917
Mama will be so surprised.

13:39.000 --> 13:39.917
Mary?

13:45.750 --> 13:48.542
Hurry up! The figs won't pick themselves.

13:50.458 --> 13:52.042
Why can't we just walk?

13:52.542 --> 13:54.542
[distant voices echoing]

-My lord.
-Yes?

14:18.375 --> 14:19.625
[reads indistinctly]

14:19.708 --> 14:22.417
I've had many reports of discontent.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.000
Pharisee discontent.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.458
-Yeah?
-In the prosperous hillside areas.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.833
Discontent?

14:28.917 --> 14:29.833
Yes, sire.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.000
And why is there discontent, Marcellus?

14:33.167 --> 14:35.000
They want you to strike

14:35.083 --> 14:37.875
against the incursions
and the Nabataean raiders.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.458
Oh. [chuckles]

14:39.542 --> 14:42.208
Also, there are those rumors.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.167
-Reports of a savior.
-Savior?

14:45.917 --> 14:47.417
And who's talking about a savior?

14:50.750 --> 14:51.583
Salome?

14:52.167 --> 14:54.500
You, my brother, are the King of the Jews.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.750
The true savior.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.042
That's all that matters.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.208
Who is talking about a savior?

15:04.458 --> 15:06.458
I've heard my husband,
and others say it, too.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.208
Your husband, Costobarus?

15:08.292 --> 15:09.125
Yes.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.167
Yes.

15:11.042 --> 15:12.000
Hm.

15:12.542 --> 15:15.542
Should I spare him?
Should I set him free? Or…

15:16.292 --> 15:18.417
Tell me, Salome.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.833
Should I have him stoned to death
in the marketplace?

15:22.083 --> 15:23.042
What say you?

15:25.708 --> 15:29.042
His head on a pike
will calm the people, surely.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.958
Tell me, would it be terrible for you

15:33.042 --> 15:36.083
to lose a husband or a loved one?

15:38.417 --> 15:40.667
Your reign will always come before love.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.583
Good.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.250
Good.

[Gabriel] Shh.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.167
[Joachim grunts]

16:21.458 --> 16:23.333
Mother is waiting for us, so…

[both laughing]

16:37.917 --> 16:40.417
[laughter continues]

16:40.500 --> 16:42.333
Mary, let's clean you up before dinner!

16:44.375 --> 16:45.792
How did you get so dirty?

16:46.458 --> 16:47.333
Well…

16:47.417 --> 16:48.750
[inhales, exhales sharply]

16:48.833 --> 16:49.958
She's very fast.

16:50.042 --> 16:53.083
[panting]

16:57.125 --> 16:58.208
[Joachim] What is it?

17:00.333 --> 17:02.250
I saw the man with the blue robe today.

17:04.583 --> 17:05.417
Papa?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.333
[bird cawing]

17:14.667 --> 17:16.333
[Joachim] Your birth was a miracle.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.083
It was a gift.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.542
For your mother and I.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.708
-[thunder rumbles]
-[breathes shakily]

17:22.792 --> 17:24.667
But in exchange, I made a promise.

17:26.417 --> 17:27.875
A promise that must be kept.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.333
[dramatic music]

17:36.333 --> 17:38.333
[horse whinnies]

17:53.792 --> 17:56.792
[crowd chatter]

18:03.083 --> 18:05.083
[sheep bleating]

18:05.167 --> 18:08.167
[crowd chatter continues]

18:22.792 --> 18:24.000
Why is she here?

18:24.083 --> 18:26.083
-Let's go home.
-No.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.083
[woman] Let the girl pass.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.167
[crowd chatter continues]

18:34.875 --> 18:36.083
[horse nickers]

18:43.458 --> 18:44.458
[woman] Ah.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.708
It's you.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.833
[Mary cries]

18:52.917 --> 18:54.917
I'm so, so proud of you.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.167
[crying]

19:06.167 --> 19:07.542
Go. Go.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.708
[somber music]

19:19.250 --> 19:20.792
I am Anna.

19:31.958 --> 19:34.875
[indistinct chatter]

19:34.958 --> 19:36.125
[chickens cluck and crow]

19:36.750 --> 19:38.250
[lamb bleats]

19:38.333 --> 19:39.833
[indistinct speech]

19:40.958 --> 19:42.125
[lamb bleats]

19:45.125 --> 19:46.000
[man] Child!

19:50.833 --> 19:52.375
Come closer, please.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.458
[indistinct chatter]

19:59.083 --> 20:00.167
Why have you come?

20:02.292 --> 20:04.458
I am here to fulfill a promise.

20:07.542 --> 20:08.375
Anna,

20:09.750 --> 20:10.750
is this true?

20:12.250 --> 20:15.125
Has the vessel of the promise
arrived at last?

20:18.542 --> 20:20.042
[sniffles and cries]

20:20.625 --> 20:24.958
El Shaddai welcomes you, child,
with open arms to your new home.

20:29.000 --> 20:29.917
Trust.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.125
He will reveal all in time.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.208
[water splashes]

20:59.667 --> 21:01.208
[distant shouting]

21:11.750 --> 21:14.583
[Anna] Mary, where are you now?

21:14.667 --> 21:16.167
-I'm coming.
-[door opens]

21:18.333 --> 21:20.875
You're late for prayer, child. Get.

21:20.958 --> 21:21.792
Sorry.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.333
[man] And shall call his name…

21:30.208 --> 21:31.250
[dress rustling]

21:32.375 --> 21:33.542
Mary, where were you?

21:35.375 --> 21:38.833
I was… [clears throat] …scrubbing
the floors and polishing the vessels.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.125
You were in the gardens again, dallying.

21:41.875 --> 21:42.875
Weren't you?

21:42.958 --> 21:44.333
No, I wasn't dallying.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.333
Before afternoon prayers.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.667
Flowers don't plant themselves.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.458
The scriptures tell us
we need to serve Him through our work.

21:52.542 --> 21:53.625
[scattered giggling]

21:53.708 --> 21:55.583
[shushes]

21:56.375 --> 21:58.083
Remember your place, girls.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.333
Next time, serve Him faster.

22:10.292 --> 22:11.667
[chuckles softly]

22:13.875 --> 22:15.292
[overlapping chatter]

22:15.375 --> 22:18.417
[horn blows]

22:22.042 --> 22:25.333
[horn blows]

22:26.958 --> 22:28.958
[overlapping chatter]

22:32.083 --> 22:33.958
I-- I beg you. Please.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.833
[girl laughing]

22:41.833 --> 22:42.917
Are you going to finish that?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.875
What? No, I'm full. Why?

22:44.958 --> 22:45.875
Can I have it?

22:50.083 --> 22:51.083
What are you doing?

22:53.833 --> 22:55.833
[overlapping chatter]

23:11.292 --> 23:13.292
[gasping weakly]

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
[overlapping chatter]

23:28.208 --> 23:29.083
[girl] Mary!

23:30.042 --> 23:30.875
Mary!

23:31.375 --> 23:32.208
Help me!

23:33.625 --> 23:35.625
[overlapping chatter continues]

23:45.458 --> 23:46.750
[man] Good evening, maiden.

23:47.583 --> 23:48.500
Oh…

23:50.125 --> 23:51.167
Didn't notice you there.

23:51.708 --> 23:52.583
Ah.

23:53.708 --> 23:56.125
I can see that you work hard.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.292
Oh.

23:58.375 --> 23:59.500
I keep busy.

24:02.042 --> 24:03.917
Leaving me little time
for small talk, so--

24:04.000 --> 24:08.667
Do you leave yourself
any time for pleasure?

24:12.875 --> 24:15.375
I find pleasure every day
in the mysteries of the Lord.

24:15.458 --> 24:17.042
-[chuckles]
-Don't you?

24:18.083 --> 24:18.917
Yes.

24:20.333 --> 24:25.458
These are troubling times
here in the temple.

24:26.167 --> 24:27.333
Don't you think?

24:29.167 --> 24:31.000
-Mary?
-[ethereal hiss]

24:32.875 --> 24:33.917
You know my name then.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.917
[whispers] I would like to know more.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.167
-Pardon me. I have studies--
-No, stay, stay!

24:42.875 --> 24:43.875
[whispers] Stay!

24:45.917 --> 24:47.708
I've heard so much about you.

24:49.208 --> 24:50.667
All the priests,

24:52.292 --> 24:53.500
they talk.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.375
Please don't do that.

24:57.167 --> 24:58.583
[fly buzzes]

24:58.667 --> 25:02.417
Tell me of your allegiance
to the King of the Jews.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.708
Our imperial sovereign, King Herod.

25:08.042 --> 25:09.708
There's only one true sovereign here.

25:09.792 --> 25:10.917
[guttural growl]

25:11.000 --> 25:12.083
My allegiance is to God.

25:12.167 --> 25:13.958
[exhales]

25:15.542 --> 25:17.292
[whispering] Then you're a zealot.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.875
A traitor in the king's temple.

25:21.375 --> 25:22.375
I'm a servant.

25:23.625 --> 25:24.833
This is God's temple.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.125
Hm.

25:30.167 --> 25:36.375
There are great rewards
for serving the king's cause, Mary.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.083
-Tangible rewards.
-[growling]

25:41.167 --> 25:42.708
I know my reward.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.583
-I must go.
-You will stay.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.583
Lucifer!

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
Let her go, brother.

25:52.792 --> 25:56.125
Gabriel, leave here.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.167
Now.

26:01.917 --> 26:05.542
[ominous whispering echoes]

26:05.625 --> 26:06.667
[whispering stops]

26:11.583 --> 26:13.500
[overlapping chatter]

26:17.042 --> 26:19.625
[man] Make way for King Herod the Great!

26:20.500 --> 26:23.417
Make way for King Herod the Great!

26:26.083 --> 26:27.375
[horse whinnies]

26:28.250 --> 26:29.083
Out of the way!

26:30.125 --> 26:31.333
Move, move!

26:32.292 --> 26:33.625
-[horse whinnies]
-Move!

26:38.667 --> 26:40.625
[Herod] My people of Judea!

26:40.708 --> 26:43.000
Citizens of Jerusalem.

26:43.083 --> 26:48.250
Today I wish to pay tribute
to our glorious emperor,

26:48.333 --> 26:50.000
Caesar Augustus.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.250
Hail to thee, almighty Caesar.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.750
-Hail!
-Hail, Caesar!

26:54.833 --> 26:56.042
-Hail!
-Hail!

26:56.917 --> 26:58.292
Good. Good.

26:58.958 --> 27:00.042
Ah.

27:02.125 --> 27:03.208
Marcellus.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.375
Sire.

27:09.500 --> 27:13.500
Our most high priest, Bava Ben Buta.
We must all remember our place.

27:13.583 --> 27:15.083
[laughs]

27:16.083 --> 27:20.458
Perhaps we could mount
the aquila elsewhere.

27:21.458 --> 27:22.792
Elsewhere?

27:22.875 --> 27:26.917
Sire, this is our Lord's house.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.292
This is the Lord's house?

27:29.500 --> 27:33.333
Tell me, did the Lord give you all this?
Did the Lord give you this mitre?

27:33.417 --> 27:37.042
Did the Lord give you my temple,
the one I have rebuilt and enlarged?

27:37.125 --> 27:39.292
Did he give you that, Bava Ben Buta?

27:39.875 --> 27:40.708
Sire.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.292
No, not sire! No, no.

27:42.375 --> 27:43.500
[laughs]

27:43.583 --> 27:47.750
I'm simply the prickly porcupine…

27:48.375 --> 27:52.792
…who will defend what is his
when he feels threatened. Yeah.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.042
Porcupine, sire?

27:55.125 --> 27:56.333
I do not understand.

27:57.375 --> 27:59.417
[chuckles]

27:59.500 --> 28:00.958
Tell me, um,

28:02.042 --> 28:05.083
do you crave or wish
for a crown of your own?

28:09.625 --> 28:11.625
I crave no crown, sire.

28:13.750 --> 28:14.583
Kneel.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.542
I'm sorry, sire. I--

28:17.125 --> 28:20.250
Kneel before your king.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.750
Good, good.

28:28.042 --> 28:34.042
Now you will feel the pains and the pangs
of despised power and sovereignty

28:34.125 --> 28:39.292
because it was you who sanctified
the whispers of intrigue, yes?

28:39.375 --> 28:46.250
Who sanctioned rumors of disloyalty
and disobedience in my temple, yes?

28:46.333 --> 28:47.917
-[pained breaths]
-[crowd murmuring]

28:48.000 --> 28:51.917
No longer will they flourish
in my temple, Bava Ben Buta!

28:52.000 --> 28:53.667
Bava Ben Buta!

28:53.750 --> 28:54.792
Bava Ben Buta!

28:54.875 --> 28:57.042
-Bava Ben Buta! Hey!
-[scepter thuds]

28:58.333 --> 28:59.500
Let me be clear.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.292
Let it be understood!

29:03.458 --> 29:06.250
That your king, I, Herod of Judea,

29:07.125 --> 29:09.500
I am your king.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.125
[droning suspenseful music]

29:19.167 --> 29:20.208
[under breath] Stop!

29:20.833 --> 29:22.042
Mary, turn away.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.917
Child.

29:28.542 --> 29:30.917
-[thunder claps]
-[man yells]

29:35.708 --> 29:36.958
[Marcellus] Sire?

29:37.042 --> 29:38.167
[fly buzzes]

29:56.042 --> 29:58.042
[breathing shakily]

30:01.417 --> 30:03.250
Vision comes in many forms.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.542
The heart, too, can see.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.958
You have to continue
to guide the faithful.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.583
[cries softly]

30:24.083 --> 30:25.083
-[muffled whimpers]
-Shh.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.250
You threatened the king.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.292
-Why?
-I didn't!

30:29.375 --> 30:30.667
What did you just do to him?

30:30.750 --> 30:32.500
Nothing, sir.
I'm just a servant of the temple.

30:33.083 --> 30:36.208
Well, something tells me
that's not entirely true.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.750
What powers do you have?

30:38.833 --> 30:41.292
-I-- I don't have any!
-What did you do to him?

30:41.375 --> 30:44.125
Captain! You have no business here.

30:44.208 --> 30:45.667
Prophetess,

30:45.750 --> 30:47.958
this maiden, she threatened the king.

30:48.042 --> 30:50.458
She did no such thing.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.583
Release her.

30:57.917 --> 30:59.083
[gasps]

30:59.167 --> 31:00.667
Leave here now.

31:03.125 --> 31:06.125
I will stop you, whatever you are.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.083
Anna. [sighs]

31:13.167 --> 31:14.042
Oh.

31:14.125 --> 31:16.292
I said nothing to the king, I promise.

31:17.292 --> 31:21.375
You are far more powerful
than words, child.

31:22.042 --> 31:23.458
You're learning.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.708
[laughs softly]

31:27.750 --> 31:30.083
[inhales deeply]

31:30.167 --> 31:32.625
-[metallic clinking]
-[overlapping chatter]

31:35.917 --> 31:39.250
[indistinct shouts]

31:49.083 --> 31:52.917
The resistance meets tomorrow to fight
the oppression of the Roman taxes.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.208
-We should go.
-No!

31:54.292 --> 31:56.958
-They will crush us.
-That's why we must go.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.875
It's time to rise up
before we're all wiped out.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.250
Rise up? To be slaughtered like cattle?

32:01.333 --> 32:03.042
You are cattle if you think like that.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.125
[man] Bring more next time.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.375
Herod rules by fear.

32:07.458 --> 32:09.792
He is not our king. He's ungodly.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.917
More Roman than Jew.
Is that what you want?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.875
I want to be more alive than dead.

32:13.958 --> 32:15.375
Joseph, what do you think?

32:16.958 --> 32:18.542
I think you're just wasting your time.

32:18.625 --> 32:20.417
You're trying to tell me
you don't believe in the cause?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.417
What cause?

32:21.500 --> 32:24.333
-[metallic clinking]
-[overlapping chatter]

32:24.417 --> 32:26.625
I only believe in
what I can see with my own eyes.

32:32.042 --> 32:34.042
[footsteps]

32:36.042 --> 32:38.958
[birds chirping and cawing]

33:05.292 --> 33:08.833
[quacking]

33:12.667 --> 33:14.958
[quacking]

33:25.583 --> 33:26.417
[whispers] Hey!

33:26.917 --> 33:27.792
Hey!

33:29.417 --> 33:30.375
Outta my way!

33:32.375 --> 33:33.500
Move along.

33:35.917 --> 33:36.750
What?

33:36.833 --> 33:39.708
The hunting is better around the bend.

34:01.417 --> 34:03.542
[wind blowing]

34:09.208 --> 34:12.083
[soft ethereal music]

34:48.583 --> 34:49.417
[Joseph] Hey!

34:50.083 --> 34:52.333
Hey! Wait, I can get that!

34:54.958 --> 34:56.250
Hey!

34:56.333 --> 34:57.458
Wait!

34:58.042 --> 34:59.792
Hey, I-- I'll get that for you!

35:00.333 --> 35:01.792
I can help you!

35:02.500 --> 35:04.542
Hey! Wait!

35:05.708 --> 35:06.667
Who are you?

35:08.333 --> 35:09.958
Wait, don't go!

35:10.667 --> 35:11.958
Please, don't go!

35:13.125 --> 35:15.333
Just tell me your name!

35:16.750 --> 35:18.250
What's your name?

35:18.833 --> 35:19.875
What's your name?

35:19.958 --> 35:21.042
[laughs]

35:21.667 --> 35:23.958
I'm the daughter of Joachim of Nazareth.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.583
And you are… crazy.

35:29.458 --> 35:30.792
[laughs]

35:35.667 --> 35:36.792
[bird caws]

35:36.875 --> 35:39.417
Do we not have the right
to live as free men,

35:39.500 --> 35:42.875
to harvest our olives
to feed our families?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.375
To worship without fear?

35:45.458 --> 35:48.000
Your workers there,
they speak of protest and zealotry.

35:48.583 --> 35:50.208
It's just talk. They're good men.

35:50.292 --> 35:53.458
They talk of resistance.
You can't allow this. It's treason.

35:54.375 --> 35:56.792
Their hearts are in the right place.

35:57.625 --> 35:58.625
What are you saying?

36:00.375 --> 36:03.292
The regime is corrupt and unholy.
You know it as well as I.

36:03.375 --> 36:06.458
You're a party to this treason
if you do not stop them.

36:07.292 --> 36:10.083
[man speaking indistinctly]

36:10.167 --> 36:11.792
You're overreacting.

36:11.875 --> 36:15.792
You put your own family's prosperity
at risk. And their safety.

36:15.875 --> 36:17.625
[indistinct speech continues]

36:25.875 --> 36:27.208
Can I ask you something, Anna?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.083
Is this about a boy?

36:32.167 --> 36:33.583
What? No.

36:34.167 --> 36:35.417
I'm not so sure.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.750
You've been here for a long time, right?

36:39.833 --> 36:42.625
I haven't left the temple in 47 years.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.792
Is that long?

36:46.625 --> 36:47.792
Pretty long, yes.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.875
[distant indistinct speech]

36:51.000 --> 36:52.792
I don't know how to ask you this, but…

36:55.583 --> 36:57.625
Isn't that kind of a dull life?

36:59.208 --> 37:00.042
Dull?

37:00.875 --> 37:02.333
[Anna sighs]

37:02.417 --> 37:06.167
Living continuously face to face with God.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.833
Losing the narrowness of self-interest,

37:09.917 --> 37:13.875
and being absorbed
in the ever-widening interests

37:13.958 --> 37:16.167
which God makes known to me?

37:17.042 --> 37:19.417
Hmm, would you be so lucky, child?

37:21.917 --> 37:22.750
Right…

37:25.792 --> 37:28.833
But can't I do even more good
outside the temple?

37:30.792 --> 37:31.625
I-- I mean…

37:32.625 --> 37:36.625
How can I do anything important
if I'm stuck in here?

37:36.708 --> 37:38.417
I told you it was about a boy.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.500
It's not.

37:39.583 --> 37:40.750
It's always about a boy.

37:40.833 --> 37:42.208
Anna, I'm promised to the Lord.

37:43.083 --> 37:43.917
Hm.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.000
Do you doubt my fidelity?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.042
No.

37:51.292 --> 37:52.208
Do you?

37:54.333 --> 37:55.458
What's that supposed to mean?

37:55.542 --> 37:59.542
It means come downstairs
and help me in the kitchen.

38:02.917 --> 38:03.875
[knocks at door]

38:03.958 --> 38:05.042
Hello, sir.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.833
May I have your daughter's hand?

38:07.500 --> 38:09.333
[rooster crows]

38:09.417 --> 38:11.125
Her hand? What?

38:11.750 --> 38:14.375
Yes. In marriage, sir. May I have it?

38:15.375 --> 38:18.042
Who are you? How do you know Mary?

38:19.375 --> 38:21.333
Mary. So that's her name?

38:21.417 --> 38:22.458
You don't know her name?

38:22.542 --> 38:24.083
Well, I do now, sir.

38:24.167 --> 38:26.083
Please, may I have her hand?

38:26.167 --> 38:27.917
-There's a spirit about her, and…
-Who's here?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.875
I have no idea.

38:29.958 --> 38:31.042
[bird caws]

38:32.042 --> 38:33.000
Young man,

38:33.750 --> 38:35.125
Mary is vowed to the Lord.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.333
Yes. I understand.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.375
But please, let me assure you,
this is meant to be.

38:40.958 --> 38:42.458
[rooster crows]

38:43.417 --> 38:44.458
[sighs]

38:45.208 --> 38:46.375
Young love.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.958
[laughs]

38:49.542 --> 38:52.000
But it's not. She's accounted for.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.083
Um, um--

38:54.750 --> 38:56.250
-Wait!
-[Anne] How can you say that?

38:56.333 --> 38:59.250
-How can you speak for her like that?
-[Joachim] How can I speak for her?

38:59.333 --> 39:01.833
I'm her father. And we decided.

39:01.917 --> 39:04.333
-This is a stranger.
-[Anne] We didn't decide. You decided.

39:04.417 --> 39:05.500
[Joachim] What are you trying to say?

39:05.583 --> 39:08.875
Please, I'm so sorry to bother you.
Just listen to me for one second.

39:08.958 --> 39:12.667
I've never experienced
anything like this in my entire life.

39:13.292 --> 39:15.875
Something changed in me
when I saw your daughter.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.417
I was hunting down by the river.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.125
I saw this…

39:20.917 --> 39:22.125
beautiful…

39:22.958 --> 39:25.250
and gentle creature…

39:26.708 --> 39:28.375
…just dancing in the wind.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.542
And I knew…

39:32.167 --> 39:33.250
She is my wife.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.583
And it never would have happened

39:35.667 --> 39:37.458
if this strange man in a blue robe

39:37.542 --> 39:39.458
-wouldn't have led me to her.
-A blue robe?

39:39.542 --> 39:40.500
Yes, a blue robe.

39:51.792 --> 39:52.708
[Mary] Mama?

39:54.542 --> 39:55.417
Mm.

39:56.583 --> 39:58.750
[distant indistinct chatter]

39:58.833 --> 40:00.875
-Wait! Papa, is he okay?
-He's fine.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.250
Older.

40:06.750 --> 40:07.667
Mary…

40:09.792 --> 40:12.333
Your father and I
have promised you to a young man.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.000
I-- I don't understand.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.833
We have decided you're to be married.

40:21.958 --> 40:22.792
What?

40:24.333 --> 40:26.667
What do you mean? You sold me off
like one of our prized steeds?

40:26.750 --> 40:28.833
-It's not like that.
-Mother, it is like that.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.250
How could you possibly
think of allowing this?

40:32.333 --> 40:33.583
Well, I think it's a good idea.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.708
-What?
-His name is Joseph.

40:37.792 --> 40:40.542
He's serious and very handsome.

40:40.625 --> 40:41.917
Mother, I'm a servant of God.

40:42.000 --> 40:42.833
Mary…

40:45.000 --> 40:46.792
The angel appeared again.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.500
This boy is meant for you.

40:58.958 --> 40:59.958
You're Joseph?

41:02.250 --> 41:03.417
Most days, yes.

41:04.917 --> 41:06.042
[Bava Ben Buta]
Let it be known, Lord…

41:06.125 --> 41:07.958
The drowning fool in the river.

41:08.042 --> 41:10.458
…that these two
young persons before you…

41:10.542 --> 41:11.625
That's me.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.375
…in this engagement ceremony

41:14.917 --> 41:18.708
swear themselves to each other
to be married.

41:19.250 --> 41:22.833
And to your service, in love

41:22.917 --> 41:25.000
and in respect.

41:25.958 --> 41:27.458
Do you really think this is a good idea?

41:28.792 --> 41:29.917
Joseph?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.542
May the Lord bless you and protect you.

41:33.917 --> 41:36.375
-Well…
-May the Lord shine his face upon you…

41:36.458 --> 41:38.833
-…actually I do.
-…and give you peace.

41:39.917 --> 41:45.042
[Bava Ben Buta chanting]

41:49.833 --> 41:51.833

[goat bleating]

42:02.583 --> 42:04.083
[Anne sighs]

42:04.167 --> 42:05.750
So, what do you think?

42:07.917 --> 42:09.875
He's very handsome, Mother.

42:11.292 --> 42:12.292
[giggles]

42:18.500 --> 42:19.542
Goodbye.

42:19.625 --> 42:22.667
[overlapping chatter]

42:30.333 --> 42:31.208

[thunder rolling]

42:54.375 --> 42:58.250
[angelic vocalizing]

43:16.917 --> 43:18.333
I don't understand.

43:22.667 --> 43:26.875
Now it is your will that I should marry
this perfect stranger. Why?

43:37.167 --> 43:39.083
You only speak to others about this.

43:42.958 --> 43:44.875
You've got nothing to say to me.

44:02.042 --> 44:05.042
[rain pattering distantly]

44:15.000 --> 44:17.875
[rainfall]

44:17.958 --> 44:20.833
[thunder rolls]

44:25.583 --> 44:26.708
[gasps]

44:26.792 --> 44:27.625
Who's there?

44:30.208 --> 44:31.542
What do you want?

44:31.625 --> 44:34.042
Don't be afraid, Mary.

44:35.208 --> 44:38.750
You have found favor… with God.

44:41.625 --> 44:43.250
What-- What do you mean?

44:45.708 --> 44:49.250
You are to become a mother and have a son.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.542
He will reign over the house of David.

44:57.208 --> 44:59.125
But that's not possible.

44:59.208 --> 45:00.583
I can't have a child.

45:02.792 --> 45:05.667
-[rainfall stops]
-[dove coos]

45:05.750 --> 45:08.917
All things are possible…

45:11.375 --> 45:12.250
…with God.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.833
You will name him

45:19.333 --> 45:20.333
Jesus.

45:21.875 --> 45:25.000
And all the world will know him, Mary.

45:27.875 --> 45:28.958
For you

45:29.667 --> 45:32.667
are blessed among women.

45:35.958 --> 45:37.958
[birds chirping]

[rainfall resumes]

45:48.833 --> 45:51.958
[thunder rumbling]

46:02.000 --> 46:03.250
Let it be me.

46:07.833 --> 46:09.833
[birds chirping]

46:21.208 --> 46:23.833
[distant rumbling and shouting]

46:25.167 --> 46:26.500
[Herod] How strange.

46:27.292 --> 46:30.500
I bring them water,
yet they will not drink.

46:31.792 --> 46:33.500
Or they refuse to drink.

46:34.958 --> 46:35.917
Hm.

46:37.250 --> 46:40.917
Beware the tyranny of the… common good.

46:43.167 --> 46:44.042
Marcellus?

46:44.125 --> 46:45.250
Yes, my lord?

46:45.333 --> 46:47.875
Beware the tyranny of the common good.

46:47.958 --> 46:50.208
It is a serpent
who will turn and devour you.

46:51.458 --> 46:54.667
But… I shall tax them, yes.

46:54.750 --> 46:55.583
[laughs]

46:55.667 --> 47:00.208
I will call a census and tax them for
their ingratitude and their thanklessness.

47:00.292 --> 47:04.708
And they shall behold and see
the reward of the wicked.

47:05.250 --> 47:09.042
And I shall behold and see…
their suffering

47:10.125 --> 47:11.833
as my children before me.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.958
Go, Marcellus, do it.

47:15.042 --> 47:15.917
Yes, my lord.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.125
[footsteps fading]

47:18.792 --> 47:21.042
Have you told anyone about this?

47:25.333 --> 47:26.375
Who would believe me?

47:28.208 --> 47:29.583
I believe you.

47:31.542 --> 47:35.208
But you are wise
to keep this quiet for now.

47:36.500 --> 47:39.792
Not all in the temple
possess such a faith.

47:46.625 --> 47:49.375
-[distant chatter]
-[birds chirping]

47:52.042 --> 47:52.875
[man] Mary!

47:56.083 --> 47:57.917
[man] She is with child.

47:58.583 --> 47:59.625
[Bava Ben Buta] Is this true?

48:01.000 --> 48:01.833
I can explain.

48:01.917 --> 48:03.458
Is this true?

48:12.375 --> 48:13.583
I didn't do anything wrong.

48:13.667 --> 48:14.875
You have broken your vow!

48:14.958 --> 48:15.792
I haven't!

48:15.875 --> 48:17.250
She is a disgrace.

48:19.333 --> 48:20.917
You can't stay here, Mary.

48:23.042 --> 48:23.875
But…

48:27.417 --> 48:29.333
No, please, you cannot do this.

48:29.417 --> 48:31.875
It has come to pass.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.750
You will return here.

48:39.083 --> 48:41.625
[tense music swells and fades]

48:42.958 --> 48:45.083
[birds chirping]

49:01.833 --> 49:03.333
[cries]

49:08.667 --> 49:10.417
[sobs]

49:11.000 --> 49:12.708
They cast me out of the temple.

49:13.292 --> 49:14.167
What?

49:16.125 --> 49:17.417
Why would they do that?

49:24.417 --> 49:25.917
Because I'm with child, Mama.

49:26.542 --> 49:27.375
Oh, Mary…

49:27.458 --> 49:29.667
I haven't done anything wrong, I promise.

49:29.750 --> 49:31.000
But how could this be?

49:31.083 --> 49:32.917
The angel in blue, he told me--

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
The angel?

49:35.083 --> 49:36.333
He came to you?

49:37.958 --> 49:39.750
Yes, I thought it was a dream.

49:41.417 --> 49:43.250
You're the vessel of the promise.

49:45.292 --> 49:46.292
It's true.

49:46.375 --> 49:48.500
What does that mean?
Mama, I'm engaged to Joseph.

49:48.583 --> 49:50.500
We're not even married.
I can't have a baby.

49:50.583 --> 49:51.917
You are stronger than you know.

49:54.875 --> 49:57.208
You have been selected for great things,

49:57.292 --> 49:59.917
and great things never come easy.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.250
We'll get through this.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.000
As a family.

50:05.333 --> 50:06.458
So should we tell Papa?

50:06.542 --> 50:08.875
No. Do not tell your father.

50:08.958 --> 50:11.708
-I'll face him if I must.
-People will talk.

50:11.792 --> 50:14.500
You could be stoned if they find you here.

50:16.917 --> 50:19.417
I want you to go
to Aunt Elizabeth in Ein Karem.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.875
She is seven months with child,

50:21.958 --> 50:25.333
at a great age, like I once was.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.792
Another miracle of faith.

50:28.667 --> 50:29.958
You'll be safe there.

50:30.042 --> 50:32.042
Mama, I can't leave here again, please.

50:32.125 --> 50:33.417
Mary, I know.

50:36.167 --> 50:39.000
But you must go now. You must go.

50:40.375 --> 50:43.167
[dramatic music]

50:50.625 --> 50:52.500
[horse nickers]

50:56.250 --> 50:57.833
Hyah!

51:04.875 --> 51:06.667
[bleating]

51:10.750 --> 51:12.667
This is a wonderful surprise.

51:15.167 --> 51:18.500
You journeyed all this way
from the temple just to visit us?

51:19.167 --> 51:21.500
I went home first
and then Mama sent me here.

51:21.583 --> 51:23.000
I hope I'm not a burden.

51:23.083 --> 51:26.208
This child in my womb
jumps at the sound of your voice.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.042
Mary…

51:39.625 --> 51:41.250
Are you too with child, dear?

51:44.417 --> 51:45.583
Yes, I am.

51:50.042 --> 51:52.125
You are the revelation.

51:55.250 --> 51:57.583
Blessed are you among women.

51:58.292 --> 52:00.417
Blessed is this child.

52:03.583 --> 52:05.083
Sweet girl.

52:05.708 --> 52:07.625
Stay as long as you need.

52:09.125 --> 52:09.958
Thank you.

52:11.750 --> 52:13.542
Why were you not grateful, Mariamne?

52:13.625 --> 52:17.583
Grateful for the marvels we created,
for the children we raised, for the…

52:18.958 --> 52:20.125
…love we shared?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.500
Why was it never enough for you?

52:27.583 --> 52:28.542
And you.

52:30.542 --> 52:34.667
How did you become this thing,
this creature of darkness?

52:35.458 --> 52:37.167
You were not well-born, were you?

52:38.167 --> 52:39.708
Not like her, not like…

52:42.208 --> 52:43.292
Mariamne.

52:44.125 --> 52:47.083
But you did seek to enhance
and improve yourself

52:47.167 --> 52:50.667
and the unwashed kingdom of your reign.

52:51.917 --> 52:53.792
You did seek beauty, and yes, you…

52:55.167 --> 52:57.292
made some beautiful things.

52:59.833 --> 53:03.667
But it was your family, Mariamne,
your family, not mine, who debased me.

53:21.875 --> 53:24.750
[chickens clucking]

53:29.958 --> 53:31.292
[chuckles]

53:33.250 --> 53:35.625
Hi! May I hold him?

53:35.708 --> 53:36.750
Yes.

53:39.458 --> 53:41.000
Oh…

53:41.083 --> 53:42.208
Hi, John.

53:43.667 --> 53:45.458
[John babbling]

53:48.042 --> 53:49.292
It comes easily to you.

53:54.625 --> 53:56.000
I don't know if I'm ready.

53:56.792 --> 53:59.042
You have found peace here, no?

54:01.208 --> 54:02.208
I have.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.333
You must confront this
with your family behind you.

54:08.042 --> 54:09.417
More than ever,

54:10.417 --> 54:12.875
you are going to need them by your side.

54:13.708 --> 54:14.542
Father.

54:16.042 --> 54:17.042
You will face him.

54:17.792 --> 54:19.208
[man] Elizabeth!

54:19.292 --> 54:20.917
Oh, that voice.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.833
[man] Oh, there you are.

54:22.917 --> 54:25.583
-We have to leave for the market.
-[Elizabeth] Yes, yes.

54:28.208 --> 54:30.333
I didn't think I was ready either.

54:31.875 --> 54:33.833
-[baby coos]
-Mmm.

54:35.583 --> 54:37.667
Trust the strength inside you.

54:42.417 --> 54:46.667
[men chattering, laughing]

54:48.083 --> 54:49.625
What are they talking about?

54:49.708 --> 54:53.042
Fool. They're talking about you.

54:55.375 --> 54:56.208
You don't know?

54:57.917 --> 55:00.000
Your woman. [scoffs]

55:00.083 --> 55:01.333
She's with child.

55:01.917 --> 55:05.833
It's all over town. The word has spread!

55:05.917 --> 55:07.833
[laughter]

55:10.750 --> 55:12.000
[Joseph] Take it back.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.458
I can't take it back.

55:14.667 --> 55:18.042
The deed is done, the seed is planted.

55:18.708 --> 55:20.500
Kill her. [grunts]

55:21.375 --> 55:22.792
-Hey!
-Take it back!

55:43.292 --> 55:47.000
[winces, groans]

55:53.167 --> 55:54.292
Oh.

55:56.625 --> 55:59.708
[sighs]

55:59.792 --> 56:01.792
[distant thunder rumbles]

56:19.000 --> 56:20.833
Do you know what people say about you?

56:21.917 --> 56:22.958
What they say about us?

56:23.042 --> 56:25.833
But it's not true.
Papa, they don't know the truth.

56:25.917 --> 56:27.375
Tell me the truth then.

56:31.292 --> 56:32.500
You've laid with a man.

56:32.583 --> 56:34.167
No! Never.

56:35.375 --> 56:36.875
How is this possible?

56:36.958 --> 56:38.875
I told you. It was the spirit.

56:38.958 --> 56:39.792
Stop!

56:40.958 --> 56:42.708
This child will be a pariah.

56:42.792 --> 56:44.000
You don't believe me?

56:46.792 --> 56:48.792
Have you prayed for comfort
and found none?

56:51.625 --> 56:52.708
Have I prayed?

56:57.042 --> 57:01.292
I have prayed every night
since your mother hid you from me.

57:02.208 --> 57:03.792
And here you are,

57:04.333 --> 57:05.708
standing in front of me.

57:06.458 --> 57:08.375
You're with a child.

57:08.458 --> 57:09.958
How could you do this?

57:10.042 --> 57:11.667
Father, you must listen to me.

57:11.750 --> 57:13.792
You could be put to death for this.

57:14.625 --> 57:15.667
That is the law.

57:17.125 --> 57:18.208
Please.

57:20.167 --> 57:22.167
Father, it's still me. I'm still Mary.

57:25.708 --> 57:26.917
Please look at me.

57:29.208 --> 57:30.250
I need you.

57:37.833 --> 57:38.875
Papa, I need you.

57:47.542 --> 57:48.917
[sobs]

57:52.792 --> 57:54.125

57:56.667 --> 57:57.750
[exhales] Stay here.

-[pounding]
-[Joseph] Let me in!

58:03.917 --> 58:05.125
Let me in! Open up!

58:06.125 --> 58:07.458
Where is she? I must see her.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.792
-She isn't here.
-Then where is she?

58:09.875 --> 58:12.250
We've sent for her. She hasn't arrived.
I don't know where she is.

58:12.333 --> 58:14.542
[thunder rumbling]

58:14.625 --> 58:15.625
I'll find her then.

58:21.792 --> 58:22.667
What happened?

58:23.250 --> 58:24.917
Joseph, he's angry.

58:25.458 --> 58:27.292
-He needs to calm down.
-I must speak to him.

58:27.917 --> 58:29.000
Wait, Mary.

58:29.083 --> 58:30.083
Be careful.

58:30.583 --> 58:32.583
[overlapping chatter]

58:48.750 --> 58:49.583
Joseph.

58:54.042 --> 58:55.375
[exhales]

58:56.750 --> 58:58.083
The temple whore.

58:58.625 --> 59:00.667
We've been looking for you.

-[men shouting]

59:28.542 --> 59:31.375

59:36.333 --> 59:40.375
She is carrying a contaminated seed!

59:40.458 --> 59:42.625
Mary! Stop!

59:42.708 --> 59:44.500
Have you gone mad, people?

59:44.583 --> 59:46.875
Joseph, look at her!

59:46.958 --> 59:49.333
She's an outrage
to the laws of our people.

59:49.875 --> 59:52.708
Stone her. Exact God's punishment.

59:52.792 --> 59:55.042
[crowd shouting]

59:55.625 --> 59:57.750
Joseph, she dishonored you.

59:58.250 --> 59:59.583
Made you the fool.

01:00:01.625 --> 01:00:03.958
[all chanting] Stone her! Stone her!

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:07.750
Stone the virgin whore!

[shouting continues in distance]

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:41.333
[man] No, she wasn't there!
Over there! She's over there!

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:42.583

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.542
You may not believe me…

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.708
…but I was chosen for this.

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:12.833
I don't know why.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I really don't.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.375
All those people out there…

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.917
…can call me all sorts of names.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:36.042
But I'm going to bring this child into
the world with love and honor and respect.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:38.875
I, uh…

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.583
…was actually trying to find you.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.167
To tell you I don't care what they say.

01:01:50.208 --> 01:01:51.375
But what I do know…

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.250
…is that I'm going to love this child
as best as I can.

01:01:58.167 --> 01:01:59.208
And if you let me,

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:02.833
I will love you as best as I can.

Let these knots be tied.

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:33.083
Let these two be joined under God.

The zealots broke into the house
looking for Mary.

01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:20.333
They are coming back.

Whoa. Why are you here?

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:18.667
Come here.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:23.042
I know someone
who harbors zealots on his groves.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:24.125
His name?

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.542
Father, don't do this.

01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.292
-Let's just go home.
-Quiet, Noam.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:29.125
His name is Joachim.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:32.625
And his house sits on the highest hill
in Jerusalem, north of the Temple Mount.

His daughter just married.

01:07:11.292 --> 01:07:13.000
He's still out in celebration.

Yes, commander.

His daughter? Tell me about her.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.042
I don't know much.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.250
She hasn't lived here for years.

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.000
Her name is Mary.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.292
[ragged breath] Yes.

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.417
Huh.

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:41.625
She's a very special girl,

01:07:42.417 --> 01:07:43.375
isn't she?

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.875
What power does she possess?

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:55.208
They say she carries
the real King of the Jews.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:07:58.583
All over the world,

01:07:59.917 --> 01:08:03.583
believers search the skies
for a sign of his birth.

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.542
A sign?

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:06.667
And what is this sign?

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:09.875
A star.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:12.625
A wandering star…

01:08:14.292 --> 01:08:17.375
…rising higher and brighter
than all others.

01:08:17.458 --> 01:08:20.083
[breath trembling]

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.417
[swallows dryly]

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:31.792

01:08:33.292 --> 01:08:36.500
[wild dogs yelping in distance]

01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.917
You sleep so peacefully within me.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.583
I'll always protect you.

01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:56.917
Always.

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:19.167
[Mary] Thank you, Joseph.

01:09:21.333 --> 01:09:22.167
You're awake.

01:09:28.083 --> 01:09:29.083
Is something wrong?

01:09:32.083 --> 01:09:32.958
Nothing's wrong.

01:10:07.125 --> 01:10:09.083
I just don't understand all of this.

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:16.292
Why me?

01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:26.708
Because you were in the river.

01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:39.583
-Hey!

[swords clanking]

01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:52.333
-Stay in the tent.
-Joseph, where are you going?

01:10:52.417 --> 01:10:54.417
[grunts]

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:04.500

[man shouts]

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:14.000
No!

01:11:15.625 --> 01:11:18.583
[shouts indistinctly] Go! Go!

01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:21.667
-[horses whinny]
-[men shout]

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.083
[Mary] No, no.

01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:41.000
No.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.333
No!

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:47.958
No.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.958
I'm sorry. [crying]

01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:58.417
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.250
I'm sorry.

01:12:07.083 --> 01:12:08.833
[sobs]

01:12:21.458 --> 01:12:24.833
[sniffling]

01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:02.833
There are soldiers ahead
collecting the Roman tax.

01:13:04.833 --> 01:13:06.250
We can't be stopped with Mary.

01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:11.208
I need you to distract them.

01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:14.042
Pass through the soldiers, pay the tax.

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:16.958
Mary and I will go to Bethlehem.

01:13:18.292 --> 01:13:19.875
My family is from there.

01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.042
Our arrival will not be questioned.

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:25.542
[horse nickers]

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:28.625
I will go.

01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:32.500
I'll find you there.

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.625
I'll find you there.

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:40.625

[scepter thuds]

01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:57.208
Great Herod.

01:13:57.292 --> 01:13:58.292
Yes?

01:13:58.375 --> 01:14:00.958
My king, Balthasar, is on a journey

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:03.208
with King Melchior and King Caspar.

01:14:03.292 --> 01:14:05.500
They seek a rising star in your kingdom.

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:10.208
It will guide them to the child
to be born King of all the Jews.

01:14:11.667 --> 01:14:16.000
[scoffs] I don't understand.
I thought I was King of all the Jews.

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:18.417
Did you not come here to honor me?

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.917
Great Herod,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.125
the prophecies,
they speak of the coming Messiah.

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:24.292
So you believe in these things.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:26.625
You believe in the star
and the savior, correct?

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.542
Indeed.

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:30.833
And you believe in the dust
blown on the wind of dreams

01:14:30.917 --> 01:14:32.708
across the waters of the moon?

01:14:32.792 --> 01:14:37.083
And now you're searching the heavens
for a star and a savior.

01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:38.000
Yes?

01:14:39.125 --> 01:14:42.458
You see, I make things, real things.

01:14:42.542 --> 01:14:45.042
Uh, beautiful things,
or so I've been told,

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:49.917
of iron and bronze and gold and fortresses
and temples and theaters and cities.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:53.542
They call me the king of the thing.

01:14:54.292 --> 01:14:55.750
[chuckles] Shh.

01:14:55.833 --> 01:15:00.292
So I ask you,
what need have we of a Messiah?

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.333
Huh?

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:16.083
[overlapping chatter]

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:20.417
[chickens clucking]

01:15:22.167 --> 01:15:23.333
[sheep bleating]

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:27.292
Is this all for the Roman census?

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.667
Something else is happening.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:35.542
[overlapping chatter]

01:15:35.625 --> 01:15:37.333
I have some fresh bread, here.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.875
-Take some. They're from this morning.
-No, thank you.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.583
Here, some fresh bread for you.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.125
-[gasps]
-Oh. Hey! Hey, what's wrong?

01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:46.042
[gasps]

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:48.875
You-- You're fine. You're fine.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.042
You just need some rest.

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.458
[women chattering]

01:15:54.542 --> 01:15:55.375
All right.

01:15:57.292 --> 01:15:58.208
Almost there.

01:15:59.042 --> 01:15:59.917
Look at me.

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:01.833
You're fine.

01:16:03.917 --> 01:16:05.625
-Here.
-[sighs]

01:16:08.042 --> 01:16:10.958
[exhales]

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.375
Can you please watch over her for me?

01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:18.667
I'll be back shortly.

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.875
Here. Thank you.

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:24.792
[overlapping chatter]

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.167
I'll find us a place to stay.

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:33.458
Go.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.333
Go.

01:16:38.917 --> 01:16:40.917
[overlapping chatter]

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:50.167
Can we please get a room?
My wife is pregnant, and we need--

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:51.583
-No, no.
-But, what--

01:16:53.792 --> 01:16:56.292
Hello, my friend.
My wife is having a baby right now.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:57.958
Can we please have a room in this place?

01:16:58.042 --> 01:16:58.875
We're full.

01:16:59.542 --> 01:17:01.000
Can I please get a room here? I need--

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.500
-Go away.
-Wait, please. But--

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.750
-[innkeeper] Not here.
-[man] Why not?

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:07.292
Please. We're tired.

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:10.083
-She's a woman. We need a place.
-It's not my problem.

01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm sorry. We're full.

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:17.417
Yeah, yeah. I know. But can you just--

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.875
Can you just please tell me
why are all these people here?

01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:21.833
A child will be born in Bethlehem.

01:17:22.542 --> 01:17:23.708
What child?

01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:24.708
The Messiah.

01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:31.292

01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:41.875
My dear,

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:43.958
are you well?

01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:47.625
[sighs]
Do you have some water, please?

01:17:48.292 --> 01:17:50.167
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:00.542
Here. Take this.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:02.958
[breathing heavily]
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.208
Feel better now.

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:08.333
Drink up.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.792
[voice deepens] My cup is full.

01:18:12.958 --> 01:18:15.083
[wind blowing]

01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:17.125
What kind of God

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:21.042
would put a precious child like you
through all of this?

01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:23.167
So much hardship.

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:25.208
[heavy breaths]

01:18:25.292 --> 01:18:29.167
He relishes in your suffering. I know.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:31.667
I know you feel this.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.625
Let me ease your pain.

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:36.958
No more death.

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:40.125
[whispering] No more sacrifice.

01:18:40.708 --> 01:18:43.083
It can all be so easy.

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:46.208
Come with me, Mary.

01:18:46.875 --> 01:18:49.958
Break free from all this pain.

01:18:58.542 --> 01:19:01.375

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.000
Shh.

01:19:55.083 --> 01:19:55.958
I'm here.

01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:59.000
Everything is going to be all right.

01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:01.917
Come. Come on.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.375
[horse snorts]

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:06.375
Where are we?

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:07.875
Joseph found shelter.

01:20:09.542 --> 01:20:10.667
It's time.

01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:15.958
[exhales]

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:16.917
Come on.

[dramatic music]

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:37.250
Look at me!

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.167
-Yes.
-[grunts]

01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:41.458
Breathe!

01:20:43.542 --> 01:20:46.083
[screaming]

01:20:47.667 --> 01:20:49.750
Elizabeth! Keep her head up!

01:20:51.042 --> 01:20:52.958
Mary, look at me!

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:56.042
Stay with me.

01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:57.083
Almost there.

01:20:58.917 --> 01:21:01.917

01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:17.458
[strained grunt]

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:20.708
Breathe.

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:23.542
[rapid deep breaths]

01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:27.333

01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.125
You'll be all right.

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:42.208
I choose you just as you chose me.

01:22:45.333 --> 01:22:47.875
[man] There was a birth in Bethlehem,
Your Majesty.

01:22:48.875 --> 01:22:50.333
I saw the light myself.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:54.250
The goats stopped bleating
and the cattle didn't graze.

01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:57.083
There never was such a stillness before.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:22:59.958
Marcellus?

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.542
Sire.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:07.917
Who is this wretched man standing
before me? Who is he? Why is he here?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.458
He's just a common shepherd, sire.

01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:12.708
Oh. [chuckling] I understand.

01:23:12.792 --> 01:23:15.250
And this, uh… [laughs]

01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:18.542

But there is only one that matters.

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:48.167
Put to the sword every male infant
in the city of Bethlehem.

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.625
When it is done,
bring me word that it is done.

01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:52.833

01:38:45.125 --> 01:38:46.208
[chattering]

01:38:46.292 --> 01:38:47.458
We should stop now.

01:38:47.542 --> 01:38:48.583
We've come this far.

01:38:49.083 --> 01:38:51.458
Mary, we'll never get through.

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:56.125
Mary, please, listen to me.
We can go back right now.

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.583
[Anna] Come in, Mary.

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.750
[indistinct chatter]

01:39:24.875 --> 01:39:26.500
[exhales]

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:34.208
We have been waiting.

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:44.458
[ethereal orchestral music]

01:40:21.083 --> 01:40:22.667
This child…

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:29.167
…is destined to cause
the fall and rise of many in Israel.

01:40:30.625 --> 01:40:32.917
And he will be opposed.

01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:38.958
And the sword
will pierce your soul, Mary,

01:40:39.042 --> 01:40:44.500
so that the thoughts of many hearts
may be revealed.

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:17.167
Blessed are you, Lord, our God,
King of the Universe…

01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:18.917
[baby coos]

01:41:26.208 --> 01:41:27.625
[Mary]
Love will cost you dearly.

01:41:31.458 --> 01:41:32.792
It will pierce your heart.

01:41:36.333 --> 01:41:37.250
But in the end…

01:41:42.542 --> 01:41:44.000
…love will save the world.

01:41:47.083 --> 01:41:49.583
[sighing]
