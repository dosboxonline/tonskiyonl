29:32.166 --> 29:34.874
- Oh, that's, that's bad.
- Yeah.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.832
You know, that's my car.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.624
- [laughs]
- A gift to her as I left.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.749
- Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.040
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.082
But at least
you're rid of him now, man.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sorry, man.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.540
What brings you here, then?

29:52.541 --> 29:54.999
Er, my mom married
this British guy,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.041
so... here I am.

29:57.833 --> 29:58.958
How's it going?

30:00.291 --> 30:02.541
Didn't exactly have
a welcoming committee.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.750
His son's a real asshole.

30:06.666 --> 30:09.166
So you got two shit men
in your life, then, yeah?

30:09.958 --> 30:11.000
[Noah] Guess so.

30:12.708 --> 30:14.500
Here.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.040
I'm giving you my number.

30:17.041 --> 30:20.665
You need at least
one decent friend.

30:20.666 --> 30:23.415
And I like a girl
who knows her cars.

30:23.416 --> 30:24.999
Yeah, well, my dad raced,

30:25.000 --> 30:26.707
so I've been around them
my whole life.

30:26.708 --> 30:27.790
- Is it?
- Yeah.

30:27.791 --> 30:29.707
And what,
is he still on the track?

30:29.708 --> 30:31.958
Not something
you can do a lot of from jail.

30:36.708 --> 30:38.875
[exhales] Mad.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.249
But what, you got
the racing gene, then, yeah?

30:42.250 --> 30:43.957
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah?

30:43.958 --> 30:45.207
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

30:45.208 --> 30:47.415
He taught me how to drive
before he taught me to walk.

30:47.416 --> 30:50.082
And then I won a bunch
of kart races, you know,

30:50.083 --> 30:52.541
NASCAR Youth.
You know the drill.

30:53.333 --> 30:57.207
I really don't, babe.
I got my licence last year.

30:57.208 --> 30:58.874
- Yeah, man. [chuckles]
- No way!

30:58.875 --> 31:00.665
- Yeah.
- So what about you?

31:00.666 --> 31:03.165
Have you got a dad in prison
and a cheating ex-boyfriend,

31:03.166 --> 31:04.291
or just me?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.540
That is just you, babe.

31:06.541 --> 31:08.499
- OK.
- Very specific story, though.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.790
Drove so fast that
he wrapped it round a tree,

31:14.791 --> 31:16.290
and nearly took both of us out, yeah.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.665
Hey, Jenna, you hear they're
setting up to race later?

31:18.666 --> 31:20.374
That's if the cops don't show.

31:20.375 --> 31:23.582
Whose grand idea was that?
Yours?

31:23.583 --> 31:25.040
[Noah] There's a race?

31:25.041 --> 31:27.082
No, babe, in the UK,
we don't race.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.290
Yeah, we cruise and we drift
and we pose,

31:29.291 --> 31:31.290
but we don't race
cos we get shut down.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.874
And you know that.
Don't make that face, neither.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.957
Yes, mate,
I love your girlfriend so much.

31:35.958 --> 31:39.207
Ah, babe.
This is my boyfriend, Lion.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.624
And this is our good friend,
Nick.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.457
- Hi, babe. This is Noah.
- [Lion] Noah.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.332
[Jenna] She just moved here
from Florida

31:44.333 --> 31:47.500
to live with her stepdad
and a dickhead of a son.

31:52.875 --> 31:55.083
So you two know each other,
then, yeah?

32:10.958 --> 32:12.957
- From school?
- [chuckles]

32:12.958 --> 32:15.499
Nah, Lion turned down
his offer from Cambridge.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.665
- Didn't you, mate?
- I did that. I did that.

32:17.666 --> 32:20.790
No, I own a boxing gym
over in Brixton, yeah.

32:20.791 --> 32:23.290
And one day,
this posh kid wanders in

32:23.291 --> 32:25.665
and said he wants to learn
to fight, you know, so...

32:25.666 --> 32:28.874
Nick fights? Like... in a ring?

32:28.875 --> 32:32.207
Yeah. Yeah. Nick fights, yeah.

32:32.208 --> 32:34.665
Not many that can beat him.
Not even me.

32:34.666 --> 32:35.832
[Lion] Not even Knuckles.

32:35.833 --> 32:38.415
Lion started taking him
to these bare-knuckle fights.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.082
They're fuckin' brutal, babe.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.457

wanted to join in, you know.

32:48.125 --> 32:51.291
Yeah, he was in a pretty
dark place back then, man.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.249
- Speak of the devil.
- Yo.

32:54.250 --> 32:55.875
You all right, mate?

32:56.458 --> 32:57.915
What's up with you?

32:57.916 --> 32:59.790
[Jenna] What do you think
is up with her, bro?

32:59.791 --> 33:02.540
Her best friend
just smashed her boyfriend.

33:02.541 --> 33:06.415
- How would you be?
- What, for real?

33:06.416 --> 33:08.083
[Noah]
Yeah, whatever. It's fine.

33:08.833 --> 33:10.415
[Jenna]
Babe, you got two options, yeah?

33:10.416 --> 33:14.874
Either we send a kiss pic back,
or get messy.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.207
- [Lion] Messy?
- [Jenna] Messy.

33:16.208 --> 33:19.040

No, I ain't betting against him.
I ain't betting against my bro.

What are you doing, man?

35:35.458 --> 35:36.832
What was that?

35:36.833 --> 35:38.957
It's him. He's putting down
a month's wages on Nick

35:38.958 --> 35:40.415

against Ronnie.

35:40.416 --> 35:43.499

of a year in prison.

He's a proper bad guy.
Gun-for-hire-type bad.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.124
He's always hated Nick, man.

He thinks he's some spoiled

42:58.125 --> 42:59.250
I don't have a choice.

There's always a choice.

[phone beeps]

43:30.208 --> 43:31.416
Nick.

43:48.791 --> 43:50.500
I just wanted to say thanks.

43:52.541 --> 43:53.833
For the kiss.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.583
[Nick] No problem.

43:57.958 --> 43:59.707
I'd do it for anyone.

43:59.708 --> 44:01.415
- Oh, yeah?
- Hmm.

44:01.416 --> 44:02.833
Lion?

44:04.083 --> 44:05.499
Giles?

44:05.500 --> 44:08.999
- Zach?
- I don't trust Zach.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.458
Plus he never has a clean shave,
so...

44:16.458 --> 44:18.207
I don't know.

44:18.208 --> 44:21.624
There's something about
a... five o'clock shadow

44:21.625 --> 44:23.500
that does something to me.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.750
Shame it's only just after four.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.541
Goodnight.

44:57.791 --> 44:59.500

45:08.250 --> 45:09.957
[Ella] Have you spoken to Dan?

45:09.958 --> 45:11.832
How's he doing?

45:11.833 --> 45:13.540
More importantly,
how are <i>you</i> doing?

45:13.541 --> 45:15.415
Actually, pretty good.

45:15.416 --> 45:17.166
Good.

45:18.666 --> 45:21.874
Oh, Nick, I've just seen
your eye. What...?

45:21.875 --> 45:24.416
Yeah, he did it last night
at boxing.

45:26.708 --> 45:27.874
[William] Crumpet?

45:27.875 --> 45:32.832
Right. I'm gonna go see Maddie,
so I'll probably stay overnight.

45:32.833 --> 45:34.874
Well, I think
you should take Noah with you.

45:34.875 --> 45:35.999
Who's Maddie?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.124
[William]
It's a beautiful drive.

45:38.125 --> 45:40.333
You'd love the countryside.

45:41.458 --> 45:42.833
We leave in ten.

45:49.916 --> 45:52.957
[softly] Maddie? Who's Maddie?

46:55.791 --> 46:57.166
Wait.
Who do you think Maddie is?

46:58.333 --> 47:01.499
[chuckles]
No, Maddie is my sister,

47:01.500 --> 47:02.750
and that's my mother.

47:08.208 --> 47:10.624
Oh, my God, you've gotten big!

47:10.625 --> 47:12.874
I still can't believe
you let her drive your car.

47:12.875 --> 47:15.374
Yeah, to be fair, I can't
believe it either. [chuckles]

47:15.375 --> 47:17.040
Can I drive it?

47:17.041 --> 47:19.332
I'd let you drive.
I don't know about Mum.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.290
I don't know how Mum
would feel about that,

47:21.291 --> 47:22.374
but I'd let you drive.

47:22.375 --> 47:24.749
[chuckles] It was not...
I was safe, I promise.

47:24.750 --> 47:26.457
[Nick] She was good.
She was good.

47:26.458 --> 47:28.540
- [Mum] No, please.
- [Noah] Let me help.

47:28.541 --> 47:32.040
- Are you sure? I can carry...
- Yes! Relax. I've got this.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.208
OK.

47:34.500 --> 47:37.499
[Nick] Yeah? You go hide.
Ten seconds.

47:37.500 --> 47:39.833
Ten, nine...

47:41.166 --> 47:42.582
She's great. [chuckles]

47:42.583 --> 47:44.499
- She's cute, isn't she?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

47:44.500 --> 47:47.415
We're playing hide and seek.
I've got about a minute.

47:47.416 --> 47:50.125
She's absolutely terrible at it.
[chuckles]

47:51.041 --> 47:53.791
- Your mum's great, too.
- Yeah.

47:56.541 --> 47:58.541
How old were you
when they split up?

47:59.750 --> 48:03.833
Er... she actually left
when I was 12.

48:04.875 --> 48:06.375
And when did you reconnect?

48:07.333 --> 48:10.583
Er, like, two years ago,
something like that.

48:11.833 --> 48:12.874
How did that...?

48:12.875 --> 48:14.582
All right, what is this,
an interrogation?

48:14.583 --> 48:16.458
Sorry, I was just curious.

48:18.375 --> 48:19.833
I'm joking.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.000
Just joking.

48:25.333 --> 48:27.540
The deal between me and my mum

48:27.541 --> 48:30.540
is that I can continue
to see Maddie

48:30.541 --> 48:32.583
as long as
I stay out of trouble.

48:33.125 --> 48:35.665
Which means no fighting.

48:35.666 --> 48:39.374
As long as I play by her rules,

48:39.375 --> 48:42.457
I get to see the most
important woman in my life.

48:42.458 --> 48:43.583
[chuckles]

48:44.583 --> 48:47.415
I don't think your girlfriend
would care to hear that.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.583
[chuckles]

48:50.000 --> 48:51.041
Who?

48:53.958 --> 48:56.957
I don't know. The girl
you went to the gala with?

48:56.958 --> 48:59.333
The one you hang with and...

49:00.375 --> 49:02.041
Anna and I are just friends.

49:03.666 --> 49:05.208
Does she know that?

49:06.583 --> 49:08.791

49:10.041 --> 49:12.374
[quietly] Five? [yells] Five!

Four!

Three!

49:16.208 --> 49:18.165
Two!

49:18.166 --> 49:21.165
One!
Ready or not, here I come.

49:21.166 --> 49:23.250

- [Nick] Thank you.

49:25.125 --> 49:28.333
[Nick in a sing-song voice]
Maddie! Where are you?

49:28.958 --> 49:30.416
Just disappeared!

- [Nick laughs]
- [Maddie squeals]

49:32.791 --> 49:34.707
[Maddie]
Yeah, it looks like confetti.

49:34.708 --> 49:36.249
[Noah]
It does look like confetti.

49:36.250 --> 49:39.040
- You're so right. It's pretty.
- [Mum] I wasn't going to say,

49:39.041 --> 49:40.624
but you can't expect me
not to notice.

49:40.625 --> 49:41.999
[Nick]
You're being ridiculous.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.749
[Mum] Why isn't William
keeping tabs on you?

49:43.750 --> 49:45.165
I was in the ring.

49:45.166 --> 49:47.749
You don't get cuts like these
wearing gloves, Nick,

49:47.750 --> 49:49.790
so stop lying to me.

49:49.791 --> 49:52.999
Mum won't let Nick
come to my football match.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.665
[Mum] No street fights,
no racing and no drugs,

49:55.666 --> 49:57.374
or you lose your privileges
with Maddie.

49:57.375 --> 49:58.499
OK, this wasn't my fault.

49:58.500 --> 50:01.750
[Mum] No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your body is your own.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.583
I'm not gonna deal
with this shit.

50:05.958 --> 50:07.958
I'm gonna go get a drink.

50:09.375 --> 50:10.583
[chuckles softly]

50:13.375 --> 50:14.540
[Mum] Here.

50:14.541 --> 50:15.875
[Noah] Thank you.

50:20.125 --> 50:22.082
He won't be far.

50:22.083 --> 50:26.208
He just...
needs to blow off steam.

50:28.041 --> 50:30.999
I think it's great
you two have reconnected.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.291
Oh, well...

50:33.458 --> 50:36.333
Would have been nice if I hadn't
had to leave in the first place.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.915
I, um...

50:39.916 --> 50:43.458
I was... well, <i>am</i> an alcoholic.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.583
Did he tell you that?

50:49.250 --> 50:52.166
I left him and his dad
because I needed to get well.

50:53.625 --> 50:56.208
During my treatment, I tried
to reach out to Nick, but...

50:57.125 --> 50:58.458
he, er...

51:00.791 --> 51:02.291
He wasn't ready.

51:05.666 --> 51:06.665
So for years,

51:06.666 --> 51:09.500
Nick has been trying to deal
with all this by himself.

51:10.750 --> 51:11.791
[sighs]

51:12.416 --> 51:18.208
All the anger he feels for me
comes out through his fists.

Or on the road.

Families can be complicated,
can't they?

- Yeah.

51:53.541 --> 51:55.625
Maybe. I don't know, er...

51:56.125 --> 51:58.499
I'm sorry,
you've got your own shit.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.207
Yeah, but Dan's
thousands of miles away, so...

52:01.208 --> 52:02.457
[Nick chuckles]

52:02.458 --> 52:06.041
Which is lucky,
or I'd punch his lights out.

52:06.958 --> 52:10.166
Which wouldn't improve
the situation with your mom.

52:12.541 --> 52:14.000
I don't care.

52:18.375 --> 52:20.583
If you were mine,
I'd never let anyone hurt you.

52:26.083 --> 52:27.583
[sighs]

52:37.375 --> 52:38.583
[softly] Nick...

52:44.458 --> 52:47.125
I want you more
than I've ever wanted anyone.

53:06.833 --> 53:08.041
[Maddie] Nick?

53:09.208 --> 53:10.916
Is that you?

53:13.458 --> 53:14.916
[Nick] I'll be right there.

53:20.791 --> 53:22.125
Shit, Noah.

53:26.375 --> 53:28.541
What the hell
are you doing to me?

53:41.333 --> 53:42.833
See you in the morning.

53:45.250 --> 53:46.457
[Mum] Please, stop.

53:46.458 --> 53:48.374
[Maddie]
But I want him to be there.

53:48.375 --> 53:51.041
[Mum]
Maddie, we spoke about this.

53:53.583 --> 53:54.832
OK, I'll see you very soon, OK?

53:54.833 --> 53:57.000
And I will come
and watch you play, I promise.

53:58.125 --> 54:00.582
Yeah? Give me a hug.

54:00.583 --> 54:02.750
All right, come on, run along.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.624
- I'll see you later Mum, yeah?
- Hey. Hey.

54:05.625 --> 54:08.165
This is your last chance.
No more illegal fights.

54:08.166 --> 54:09.374
All right, I've got it.

54:09.375 --> 54:11.457
- OK. Look, you understand?
- Yes.

54:11.458 --> 54:13.957
[Mum] Maddie loves you so much.
You don't want to let her down.

54:13.958 --> 54:15.082
[Nick scoffs]

54:15.083 --> 54:16.665
[Mum] Oh...

54:16.666 --> 54:18.708
[Nick] Such a hypocrite.

- [car door closes]
- Let's go.

54:25.833 --> 54:27.833
[engine roars]

54:36.458 --> 54:38.582
[Noah]
Er, do you have plans later?

54:38.583 --> 54:40.415
- Do you wanna, like, watch a...
- Yeah.

54:40.416 --> 54:44.083
Yeah, I'm busy. Sorry.

54:51.916 --> 54:53.207
Hey, what's... what's going on?

54:53.208 --> 54:55.082
Look, I just need
to stay out of trouble.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.250
[scoffs]

54:57.250 --> 54:59.416
And I'm trouble, right?

55:03.875 --> 55:05.125
[scoffs]

55:06.000 --> 55:07.665
You're not afraid
your mom's gonna find out

55:07.666 --> 55:10.749
about your fight with Ronnie?
About the underground racing?

55:10.750 --> 55:12.541
I didn't race, you did.

55:13.625 --> 55:15.583
And now I have to fight Ronnie
because of that.

55:32.833 --> 55:34.458

55:55.125 --> 55:57.000
- Hello?
- [faint noise]

55:58.250 --> 55:59.333
Mom?!

56:03.708 --> 56:05.583
[quiet clattering]

56:17.500 --> 56:18.665
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God!

56:18.666 --> 56:20.290
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

56:20.291 --> 56:21.583
[door opens]

56:22.291 --> 56:23.666
Oh!

56:24.708 --> 56:26.999
Oh, I missed the surprise.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.749
[Dan chuckles nervously]

56:28.750 --> 56:30.083
Are you surprised?

56:31.458 --> 56:32.541
Yeah.

56:34.375 --> 56:37.540
That's all right, Martin.
The keys were in my bag.

56:37.541 --> 56:38.750
I know!

56:39.708 --> 56:41.290
Your mom invited me to visit.

56:41.291 --> 56:43.583
She said that
maybe you missed me?

56:44.333 --> 56:47.040
- Hug?
- Get out.

56:47.041 --> 56:51.082
Noah, please, look, I made
a mistake, OK? Never ever again.

56:51.083 --> 56:52.540
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

56:52.541 --> 56:54.582
[Dan] Yes. I wouldn't be here
if I didn't want this.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.665
Dan, come on!

56:55.666 --> 56:58.749
Oh, my God, Noah,
I was so cut up when you left.

56:58.750 --> 57:01.250
OK? I lost my girlfriend
and my best friend.

57:02.375 --> 57:05.582
I admit that what I did
was a colossal mistake,

57:05.583 --> 57:07.750
for which I deserve
to be chastised.

57:09.250 --> 57:13.250
But don't punish <i>us,</i> OK?
What we have.

57:14.083 --> 57:15.833

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:27.207
Nick!

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.665
Come on, you're such an idiot!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.500
Hey, it's my birthday.
You have to be nice.

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:36.582
[Noah exhales]

01:09:36.582 --> 01:09:39.291
[Noah] Well, I heard
what happened at the fight.

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.375
You did the right thing.

01:09:44.916 --> 01:09:45.999
Thank you.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.666
I did it for you.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.124
[Noah] Oh, did you? No!

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:52.666
[Noah yells]

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.915
[both laugh]

01:09:55.916 --> 01:09:57.291
How dare you?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.083
So...

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.540
can you guess what I want
for my birthday?

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:05.583
Better taste in music?

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.540
Ooh, you love my music.

01:10:07.541 --> 01:10:09.749
- Mmm... Not sure.
- I think you do!

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.041
Um...

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:14.208
- Some fresh hair dye?
- Ooh!

01:10:16.875 --> 01:10:18.583
[both laugh]

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.208
I know what you want.

01:10:24.041 --> 01:10:25.750
A breath mint.

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.125
I've just brushed my teeth.

01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:43.375
[whispers]
See, to everyone else...

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:47.125
just looks like
we're having a conversation.

01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:51.249
So as long as you can keep
your emotions under control...

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:52.541
You think I can't?

01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:00.000
[breathes shakily]

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.958
Oh, dear.

01:11:05.916 --> 01:11:07.749
You nearly fell
at the first hurdle.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:09.208
Shut up.

01:11:14.875 --> 01:11:18.833

[breathes heavily]

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:31.624
Do you want me to stop?
I can stop.

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:33.290
No.

01:11:33.291 --> 01:11:36.332
[breathes shakily]

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:39.125
[Ella] Noah? I'm off!

01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:44.165
You two have fun today.
Enjoy your surprise, Nick.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.332
[Noah] Uh-huh.

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:47.416
[Ella] Go easy on him, Noah.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.916
[Nick] Better get ready.

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.708
[cars rev]

01:12:22.666 --> 01:12:24.290
[Nick] No, you didn't.

01:12:24.291 --> 01:12:25.874
- I did. Yes, I did.
- You didn't.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.624
Happy birthday. [chuckles]

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:31.625
To celebrate, I thought
I could teach you how to drive.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.874
- You won one race.

Don't threaten me
with a good time.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:29.582
[Nick] Noah,
that jumpsuit you're wearing,

01:13:29.583 --> 01:13:31.790
does it zip all the way down?

01:13:31.791 --> 01:13:33.624
[Noah] You're so good
at trying to distract me

01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:34.791
but it's not gonna work!

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.624
I think the only way
you're gonna catch me

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:42.915
is with a short cut.

01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:44.749
Shut up! What do you mean,
short cut?

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:46.916
[Noah] Bye!

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.749
[Noah] OK, consolation prize.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.750
[chuckles] You didn't?

01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:07.665
[both laugh]

01:14:07.666 --> 01:14:08.791
Got me a new car.

- "Nick, happy birthday.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:17.040
Sorry about your car.

01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:18.832
Someday,
you'll buy yourself a new one.

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:20.374
- [chuckles]
- From Noah."

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:22.457
[both chuckle]

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.875
You know,
that was my favourite car.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:30.040
[sighs]

01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.540
Will you not go to the police?

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:34.916
Nah. There's, like, a code.

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:38.916
You don't talk about Fight Club?

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:41.791
Exactly.

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:09.457
You know the cashier in there
has never had a Twirl?

01:15:09.458 --> 01:15:11.582
That is a tragedy.
I can't believe it.

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.707
Well, tragedy has struck twice
cos I've never had one either.

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:15.790
No?

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:17.457
I was joking!
Of course I've had a Twirl!

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:19.915
- What am I, an alien?
- [heavy thuds]

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.582
- Whoa!
- [Ronnie] Get the fucking door!

[Noah] Oh, my God!

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:25.999
[Ronnie] Get the fucking door!

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.040
[Noah] Oh, my God! Drive! Drive!

01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.958
- Drive!
- [engine roars]

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:34.708

01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:41.250
Fuck's sake!

01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:45.875
[Nick] Now get some sleep.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.540
[Noah] <i>I don't understand.
Ronnie already took your car.</i>

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:54.332
[Nick]
<i>Something else is going on.</i>

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.124
- [Nick winces]
- [Noah] Sorry.

01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:57.583
It's all right.

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:02.333
Your touch feels good.

01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:11.083
You know it means strength.

01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:17.707
I get there's a code, whatever,

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:21.207
but at what point
do we tell someone?

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:24.540
[Nick] We don't.
I'll deal with Ronnie.

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:26.583
[Noah] You mean fight him?

01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:30.833
I don't fight anymore.

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.750
Promise.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:39.083
Right, let's get some sleep.
Early flight tomorrow.

01:16:39.541 --> 01:16:41.458
And I'm not missing it.

01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:48.582
Thank you.

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:50.499
So, Nick and Noah, yeah,
are like...?

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.207
- Yeah. Take this.
- I'm baffed.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.915
- Thank you. Ah, beautiful.
<i>- Gracias. Gracias, señor.</i>

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:58.165
Noah knows. I know.
Nick doesn't know anyone knows.

01:16:58.166 --> 01:16:59.541
- [Lion] OK.
- So, it's still...

01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:03.540
[Lion]
You know what I want, bruv.

01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:05.165
Move over.

01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:06.875
[Jenna] Do that again,
I dare you.

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:08.999
[Lion] <i>Pardon.</i> Margarita?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.582
- Ah, yes!
- Yes.

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:13.499
- Here you go, here you go.
- Lovely. Thank you.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.457
Hey, you look, like, cosy.

01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:16.790
- Cosy.
- [Nick] So cosy.

01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:18.665
I might just go jump
in the middle of you.

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:20.582
Cheers, everyone.

01:17:20.583 --> 01:17:24.165
[Lion] Ibiza, baby.
Let's get messy.

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:25.624
[Noah] We should get jet skis.

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:27.707
[Jen exhales] You're such
an adrenaline junkie.

01:17:27.708 --> 01:17:30.040
I wish we could just sit down
for ten minutes. Chill.

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:33.124
[Noah chuckles] Well then,
I'm just gonna go swim.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.874
[chuckles] Er, OK, yeah.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:37.374
[Jenna] You want me
to come with you?

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:39.915
[Noah] You don't have to,
but I'd like it.

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:41.582
- Come on!
- [Lion] Have a little paddle.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:44.249
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Have fun. Love you.

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:46.916
- [Jenna] Yeah, love you.
- Kiss. [chuckles]

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.083
[Lion] Talk to me, bro.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.415
What?

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:55.915
What's the sitch
with you and Noah?

01:17:55.916 --> 01:17:58.999
- [scoffs]
- Come. Spill the beans.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.750
There is no me and Noah.

01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:03.165
Now the problem
with that statement

01:18:03.166 --> 01:18:06.332
is I don't know if you're lying
to me or to yourself.

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.666
Come.

01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:12.457
All right. But let's just say,
for argument's sake,

01:18:12.458 --> 01:18:14.041
there was a "me and Noah".

01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:18.250
Can you imagine
how messy that would be?

01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:24.375
Look, me, personally, bro,
I like messy.

01:18:27.291 --> 01:18:29.624
- [pats leg]
- [both chuckle]

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:30.916
Look, life, yeah?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.165
You get one of 'em.

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:35.582
You gotta do what makes you
happy, all right?

01:18:35.583 --> 01:18:38.207
And you know I got you, man,
no matter what.

01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:41.040
- Feel me?
- I feel you.

01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:44.499
But, now... [Spanish accent]
Let's party, baby. Let's party.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.915
I wanna get two piña coladas.

01:18:45.916 --> 01:18:48.374
- All right, come.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

He had his hands all over her.
