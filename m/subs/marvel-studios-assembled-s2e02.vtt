00:52.343 --> 00:56.139
CHRIS PRATT: Guardians of the Galaxy was
expected to be Marvel's first big flop.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.808
They were scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.186
You know, we were picked last.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.773
And James Gunn, nine years ago,

01:04.939 --> 01:07.901
it's hard to believe,
he was the guy who did Scooby-Doo.

01:08.651 --> 01:12.030
And he was a great director.
He'd done a superhero movie, Super.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.949
It made $377,000 at the box office.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.451
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:17.744 --> 01:19.537
(LAUGHING)

01:20.413 --> 01:21.581
But he believed.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.958
He believed in himself.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.921
He believed in me. Yeah, so, thank you.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.506
(ALL APPLAUDING)

01:35.970 --> 01:40.391
KEVIN FEIGE: Guardians represents such
a big milestone for us at Marvel Studios.

01:40.475 --> 01:45.021
A group of characters that were not
the most famous group of characters ever.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.274
And yet, under the guidance
of writer-director James Gunn,

01:48.358 --> 01:50.151
they captured the world's imagination.

01:52.529 --> 01:56.199
We are very much committed
and very loyal and devoted

01:56.282 --> 01:57.909
to James', you know, vision.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.578
He's a great captain to have, absolutely,

02:00.662 --> 02:01.955
and he establishes

02:02.038 --> 02:06.000
such a beautiful environment
of friendship and creativity,

02:06.084 --> 02:07.502
but also passion.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.462
JAMES GUNN: How are
you guys feeling today?

02:09.546 --> 02:10.588
(ALL CHEERING)

02:10.672 --> 02:12.924
Welcome to Guardians of the Galaxy.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.969
PRATT: For him to have done all
three movies is a blessing for all of us.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.346
-GUNN: Yo!
-It's so uniquely his.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.639
His voice,

02:19.722 --> 02:21.558
his writing, his directing, his style,

02:21.641 --> 02:24.185
his love for animals,
his love for the bizarre.

02:24.352 --> 02:28.148
The tone, he has a very specific tone,
and it's a James Gunn tone.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.983
Lower your weapons.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.027
Let's kill that one
that looks like a carrot

02:33.194 --> 02:34.404
and show him we mean business.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.574
-After he says, "Lower your weapons."
-After he says, "Lower your..."

02:38.575 --> 02:40.535
KAREN GILLAN: We all went to Comic-Con

02:40.702 --> 02:42.829
and showed some footage
from the first Guardians.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.540
And Guardians didn't have
this huge fan base.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.585
People were aware of it, but it wasn't
like Captain America or Thor.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.921
Then I remember the whole audience
watching it in slight, like...

02:52.630 --> 02:55.341
It was like digesting something new.
That's what it felt like.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.094
And then we went to Comic-Con
the second year around,

02:58.261 --> 03:01.389
and the audience was so pumped.
They were like, "Give us more!"

03:01.556 --> 03:03.474
Are you all excited to see the show?

03:03.641 --> 03:06.311
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-All right.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.483
There's more of a connection
because the Guardians are so imperfect.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.028
(LAUGHS) I think they're more relatable.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.572
And I think, you know,
there's just a true,

03:17.739 --> 03:21.075
genuine kind of family love,
a chosen family love,

03:21.242 --> 03:23.369
which a lot of people in the world
can relate to.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.413
The Galaxy still needs its Guardians.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.334
And you will make a better leader
than I ever was.

03:29.918 --> 03:30.919
Cap'n.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.719
GUNN: When Marvel first came to me
and talked to me about

03:39.886 --> 03:43.306
perhaps doing Guardians of the Galaxy,
as stupid as it sounds,

03:43.473 --> 03:46.351
I was making lower budget films,
but I wasn't sure...

03:46.517 --> 03:49.437
I never wanted to make a movie
that I couldn't sink my teeth into,

03:49.520 --> 03:52.440
that I really didn't care about
with every fiber of my being.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.776
I was driving home from a meeting
and thought,

03:54.943 --> 03:58.196
"Well, if there was a real
talking raccoon,

03:58.363 --> 04:00.114
"where did that raccoon come from?"

04:00.281 --> 04:03.785
And I thought, "Well, this is the saddest
creature in the universe."

04:03.952 --> 04:07.455
This is a little animal that was turned
into something he shouldn't be

04:08.081 --> 04:11.042
and felt completely
ostracized and alienated

04:11.209 --> 04:14.128
from every other life form in the galaxy,
and was angry.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
(GRUNTING)

04:16.339 --> 04:18.049
Well, I didn't ask to get made.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.551
I didn't ask to be torn apart

04:20.718 --> 04:24.973
and put back again over and over,
and turned into some... (SIGHS)

04:25.139 --> 04:26.641
Some little monster.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.019
GUNN: That loneliness is really
the center of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

04:30.186 --> 04:33.314
People think of them
as light-hearted movies and fun movies,

04:33.481 --> 04:37.110
but everything that drives it
is that emotional center

04:37.277 --> 04:41.030
of Rocket and the other characters
who are all outsiders.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.742
They're going to tell you
that this is Rocket's story. It's not.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.662
It's always Peter Quill's story,
AKA Legendary Outlaw.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.081
Don't forget that. This is Star-Lord's...

04:50.248 --> 04:52.625
Who told you it was Rocket's story?
It's not.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.128
It belongs to Star... That's...

04:55.295 --> 04:56.296
It's a lie.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.881
Um, no, it is Rocket's story.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.717
I told you a million times...

05:00.883 --> 05:04.595
you keep your grimy raccoon hands
off my Zune.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.974
I told you a million times...

05:08.141 --> 05:09.600
I'm not a damn raccoon.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.519
PRATT: Sean is extraordinary.

05:11.686 --> 05:15.982
I mean, he really brings Rocket to life
for all of us on set.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.859
We'll fly away together, the four of us.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.320
Just like we always said. Okay?

05:20.737 --> 05:24.741
It started with me
essentially getting a phone call

05:24.907 --> 05:28.161
from my brother James, saying,
"Hey, I'm doing this movie

05:28.328 --> 05:30.079
"and I think I have a role for you.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.999
"I might have two roles for you."

05:33.750 --> 05:35.293
And it kind of snowballed from there.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.671
Quit smiling like an idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.134
I've talked about the process
of playing this role over the years

05:43.301 --> 05:44.927
and what it's taken.

05:45.094 --> 05:49.515
It's always, for me, been about
what I'm giving to the other actors.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.018
They need Rocket to be real.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.605
-Hey, what is that?
-That is for when things get hardcore.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.524
Sean really goes
completely out of his way

05:58.691 --> 06:01.402
to deliver a heartfelt and strong

06:01.569 --> 06:02.820
and convincing Rocket

06:02.987 --> 06:05.823
while we're shooting,
that we're able to bounce off of him

06:05.990 --> 06:07.450
because it has to be that way.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.329
I can't explain how valuable it is
to have him there and perform with him.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.040
Especially in the first film,
because he brought out

06:14.207 --> 06:15.500
some of my better moments,

06:15.666 --> 06:18.419
which, at that time,
was really important for me as an actor,

06:18.586 --> 06:20.463
as a struggling actor.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.590
All the anger,

06:23.591 --> 06:24.717
all the rage...

06:28.304 --> 06:29.764
was just to cover my loss.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.475
ZOE SALDANA: When we're
shooting the movie,

06:32.642 --> 06:34.394
I'm only going to speak for myself,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.771
I really do believe that Sean is Rocket.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.232
But also, you know,
when I watch the movie

06:39.399 --> 06:41.442
and I hear Bradley Cooper's voice,

06:41.609 --> 06:44.612
then he really feels to me
like Rocket as well.

06:44.779 --> 06:49.325
So, I feel like Rocket
is half of both these individuals.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.912
-What are you gonna do about Quill?
-Me? Why not you?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.873
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

06:56.040 --> 06:59.794
I'm proud of the work that we all
have done in creating this character.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.505
From Bradley Cooper to my brother James,

07:02.672 --> 07:05.842
and then the whole special effects team,
which is in the middle,

07:06.008 --> 07:08.219
to me, it's modern storytelling.

07:08.386 --> 07:12.723
There's a whole community of people
that made this great character.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.394
Rocket Racoon.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.321
DAVE BAUTISTA: You know, after where
we've gone with Ronan and Thanos,

07:27.488 --> 07:30.032
to find a character

07:30.199 --> 07:32.702
who is worthy
of being our adversary in this film

07:32.869 --> 07:35.121
was not an easy thing to accomplish.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.166
CHUKWUDI IWUJI: We've always
wanted to know where Rocket

07:38.332 --> 07:39.917
came from and why he's so super bright,

07:40.084 --> 07:43.337
and it turns out that
the High Evolutionary is this scientist

07:43.504 --> 07:46.924
who has been doing experiments
to create "Humanimals", he calls them,

07:47.258 --> 07:50.052
to create, in his head,
the perfect world.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.597
He thinks he's bettering the universe
by doing it

07:52.763 --> 07:55.057
and has sort of gone
into that very gray area

07:55.224 --> 07:56.893
between genius and madness.

07:57.059 --> 08:01.230
It's our sacred mission...
to take an imperfect clump

08:01.397 --> 08:04.150
of biological matter such as you...

08:04.901 --> 08:07.195
and transform it into something...

08:07.570 --> 08:08.696
perfect.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.324
It's almost like your classic father-son.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.743
Son seeks revenge,
but twisted on its head,

08:13.910 --> 08:16.746
father then seeks revenge
in my relationship with Rocket.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.122
Hello.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.959
SIMON HATT: Somewhere along the line,
it stops being about,

08:22.126 --> 08:24.003
like, this father-son relationship

08:24.337 --> 08:28.549
and it reverts to this experimenter
and specimen relationship.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.010
I made you!

08:31.177 --> 08:33.095
How did you know?

08:33.888 --> 08:37.183
SALDANA: The High Evolutionary
is aware of what he's doing,

08:37.350 --> 08:41.562
but firmly believes that
there are creatures of less importance.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.899
And they're just available for him

08:45.066 --> 08:47.401
to do with them as he pleases.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.278
It's a little baby, cute raccoon

08:49.445 --> 08:51.030
-being torn apart.
-(GASPS)

08:51.197 --> 08:55.493
And, yes, he's screeching and screaming
and you're putting him back together

08:55.660 --> 08:58.037
and it's unlike anything you've ever seen.

08:58.204 --> 09:03.209
So, I'm not gonna show a raccoon
being torn apart and put back together,

09:03.376 --> 09:05.711
-so I'm going to show it on your face.
-Okay.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.256
So that's the important thing
at the beginning.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.716
It's just your horror
of what you're seeing.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.136
That was an emotional scene
to watch him go through this torture.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.306
Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.560
This is worse than what Thanos did to me.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.437
GUNN: You don't want to just
have moustache-twirling,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.231
evil villain doing evil for no reason.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.109
"I wanna take over the world,
I wanna destroy the universe."

09:28.276 --> 09:30.570
All these things
that don't really make sense.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.821
You don't want that.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.532
But also, once you really
get to know a villain

09:34.699 --> 09:38.286
and you start to feel, "Hey,
they've got a good reason for something,"

09:38.452 --> 09:39.620
you stop hating them.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.289
You gotta hate 'em.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.125
And so, Chuk really brings
both of those things.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.335
We understand exactly what he wants to do

09:46.502 --> 09:49.213
and we also hate his guts
because he's a jerk.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.966
We need 89P13's brain...

09:52.133 --> 09:55.636
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures...

09:55.803 --> 09:58.180
before we go to the new colony.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.016
Nothing else matters.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.271
We started with images from the comic,
and James was like

10:05.730 --> 10:08.566
"That's not
who I want this villain to be."

10:08.733 --> 10:10.693
And how did he get to this point?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.153
It works in the comic,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.615
but in the evolution of the character
in this script,

10:15.781 --> 10:18.451
it needed something new
and unique and different.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.077
And it started with the makeup.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.955
And I have to say that

10:23.122 --> 10:25.875
was a great collaboration
with Legacy Effects.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.794
Legacy did a lot of makeup sketches,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.423
and then we did clothes
that went with that.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.385
IWUJI: He's a huge narcissist,
this character,

10:36.552 --> 10:38.929
and clearly, he loves
the fabrics and the colors.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.514
Royal Purple, of course.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.852
But I just love what Judianna
and the team have done

10:45.019 --> 10:48.314
with slicking him up
and making him very elegant.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.024
I want to be a dictator.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.902
I want to be a dictator.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.946
My character has actually
three makeup looks in this.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.617
We have the flashback look, which
is very similar to what you see here.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.869
Then the Rocket incident happened.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.704
(SCREAMING)

11:03.996 --> 11:07.208
And that leaves him
physically scarred also.

11:07.375 --> 11:11.754
And when we meet him in real time,
as it were, it's look number two.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.255
That's the public figure.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.883
The look I'm sure
a lot of people in Beverly Hills

11:16.050 --> 11:20.054
pay a lot of money for to look that tight,
you know? (LAUGHS)

11:20.429 --> 11:22.306
You almost have to admire their pluck.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.766
And then we have a final look,

11:23.933 --> 11:27.520
which basically
is the face behind the mask.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.941
-His face came off.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

11:34.193 --> 11:35.653
-Cut.
-(LAUGHS)

11:35.820 --> 11:36.821
Cut.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.032
He's so good and purple
and dark, and like...

11:40.199 --> 11:41.575
and evil.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.619
BAUTISTA: Chuk's incredible
playing this part,

11:43.786 --> 11:46.706
which is odd because he is just
the sweetest guy ever.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.666
You understand me, don't you?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.377
None of the others do.
You understand me, don't you?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.545
Yeah.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.807
GUNN: This is both a bigger
and a smaller story than Vol. 2.

12:04.974 --> 12:08.894
I think that, you know,
we have a lot of different planets,

12:09.061 --> 12:11.105
a lot of new places we're exploring.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.983
This is the biggest spaceship
that I've ever been in.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.069
It's three actual stories of a spaceship.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.362
So, our sets are huge,

12:18.529 --> 12:21.490
but it's also a much more intimate
and smaller story in certain ways.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.201
These characters all share
a lot of things.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.538
Really at the end of the day,
as I've said many times before,

12:27.705 --> 12:30.291
the Guardians of the Galaxy
are about a group of characters

12:30.458 --> 12:32.668
who have all experienced childhood trauma

12:32.835 --> 12:35.379
and how do they bring those traumas
into their adult life

12:35.546 --> 12:38.215
and how is it all related
to a giant space opera?

12:38.382 --> 12:42.219
And so, this movie is facing those issues
much more head-on

12:42.386 --> 12:44.305
than I think our first two movies did.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.350
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu...

12:49.310 --> 12:50.895
-Gamora.
-Gamora isn't dead.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.062
She is to us.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.150
We follow this arc of Peter Quill
through the course of these movies

12:56.317 --> 12:58.736
and really, it's been...
The first movie was

12:58.903 --> 13:02.448
a young man learning to care
about something other than himself.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.492
To be less selfish,
to be part of a family.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.244
Usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.538
Today, it's given us something.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.207
It has given us a chance.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.627
And then in the second film,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.421
it's wanting to learn more about himself,

13:17.588 --> 13:20.466
to find meaning in his identity,
to understand who he is.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.512
And he thinks he finds that
in the character that is his father.

13:24.678 --> 13:28.390
But again, he has to be reminded
that the family he's a part of

13:28.557 --> 13:30.309
is the family that adopted him.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.771
And I think the arc of the third movie
is Quill

13:33.938 --> 13:38.192
learning to be okay on his own,
and learning,

13:38.359 --> 13:41.612
as Drax powerfully puts it in a metaphor
that's given to him by Mantis,

13:41.779 --> 13:44.907
how to stop jumping
from lily pad to lily pad,

13:45.074 --> 13:46.492
but rather to learn how to swim.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.411
This is great. It's great emotional work.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.208
MAN 1: And cut.
MAN 2: Cut.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.584
Might have made a gun sound.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.756
GILLAN: Chris is such an amazing energy
to have on set.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.509
He's a perfect number one
on the call sheet,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.636
meaning that person usually sets the tone

14:05.803 --> 14:07.137
and it trickles down.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.808
-Whoa-oh! Yeah!
-I did that for you, brother.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.644
GILLAN: It's a really joyous atmosphere
with him around.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.814
I know I'm good
because I was amazing in that take.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.483
Whoo!

14:19.650 --> 14:22.570
That's the kind of acting
that really keeps me going.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.698
BAUTISTA: It's hard for me to describe
how it is working with him

14:25.865 --> 14:27.992
because our characters,
I think our acting styles,

14:28.158 --> 14:31.453
our personalities
are complete yin and yang.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.790
So... (LAUGHS) It just feels so easy.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.252
Come on, it's me, Peter Quill.
I'm one of you, remember?

14:38.419 --> 14:41.130
I don't know if there's another character,
another performer

14:41.297 --> 14:43.632
that I enjoy just bouncing off of
more than Chris Pratt.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.426
'Cause we just work together.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.345
I'm just a perfect straight man
to his high energy.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.140
Can't you see
these authentic mechanic uniforms

14:51.307 --> 14:52.892
that we're wearing on our bodies?

14:53.058 --> 14:56.061
That blend in with some of our skin-tones
better than others?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.357
Okay, now do it again like that
and then turn to Karen and go,

15:00.608 --> 15:01.859
"Now, you go!"

15:02.026 --> 15:04.153
(ALL LAUGHING)

15:04.445 --> 15:07.072
GILLAN: Everybody is so in tune
with their characters.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.992
It's like second nature now.
We can slip in and out easily

15:10.159 --> 15:11.952
because we've been doing it
for a long time.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.371
And everyone is giving
their best performances.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.123
It feels like we've never been better.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.709
It does feel like
lightning in a bottle, actually.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.505
SALDANA: I'm surprised that
Gamora is in this installment as much

15:23.672 --> 15:28.385
because I immediately knew
what had happened, you know, in Avengers,

15:28.552 --> 15:32.681
and I was just like, "Well, it would be
an honor to just come for two scenes

15:32.848 --> 15:35.059
"and then, you know,
bid everyone farewell."

15:35.434 --> 15:40.314
But I was deeply surprised
and really grateful that I got to play...

15:40.481 --> 15:43.734
Like, Gamora really has a lot to do

15:43.901 --> 15:47.112
and a lot to sort of observe
of the Guardians in this movie.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.532
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.742
What?

15:51.825 --> 15:53.494
A face-off is a trap

15:53.661 --> 15:56.622
if you're facing off against a man
more powerful than you.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.458
The Gamora of Vol. 1

15:59.625 --> 16:03.629
will have a lot more in common
with the Gamora of Vol. 3 for sure.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.922
We loved each other.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.384
I don't think so.

16:09.176 --> 16:13.305
SALDANA: Even though they have
these experience lived,

16:13.472 --> 16:15.766
you know, with the other Gamora,

16:15.933 --> 16:18.185
they feel familiar to her.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.106
But she doesn't understand why.
So it's a very confusing concept for her.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.735
But I do find this Gamora very exciting,

16:26.902 --> 16:28.779
you know, because she's very independent,

16:28.946 --> 16:31.532
and, um, she's really wild. (LAUGHS)

16:32.074 --> 16:33.242
And she's different.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.576
There's a spunk to her

16:34.743 --> 16:38.080
that, you know, Gamora never really had.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.040
So, you're a Ravager now?

16:40.791 --> 16:41.792
Put on the uniform.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.752
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.130
Who are you again?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.215
So she's now a Ravager,

16:48.382 --> 16:50.592
and so, it's a whole different
costume change.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.430
We didn't reference anything
from her other costumes at all.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.640
And we established in Guardians 2

16:56.807 --> 16:59.768
that there were a group of women Ravagers
who wore green.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.730
So she's in green.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.191
HATT: In Yondu's death,
the Ravagers have become united.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.111
So when you see them this time around,
there's Yellow,

17:09.278 --> 17:12.031
there's Blue, there's Red, there's Green,

17:12.197 --> 17:15.993
everyone's there,
and they're one Ravager tribe right now.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.747
And Gamora is a feared
and respected entity.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.500
This is what you got to live up to.
All right. Get in here.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.128
You know, we learned
a little bit in Guardians 2,

17:26.295 --> 17:30.215
when you heard the back stories
of Nebula and Gamora,

17:30.799 --> 17:34.428
that Nebula is not really
the bad guy in that situation.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.721
Gamora is the bad guy.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.306
As a child, my father would have

17:37.473 --> 17:39.725
Gamora and me
battle one another in training.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.312
Every time my sister prevailed...

17:43.479 --> 17:46.231
my father would replace
a piece of me with machinery...

17:47.066 --> 17:49.318
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.154
But she won...

17:52.780 --> 17:57.743
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.703
GUNN: Nebula has grown up quite a bit.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.581
If anything, in many ways,
she's the leader of the Guardians

18:02.748 --> 18:07.252
because Quill has been incapacitated
by his own emotional situation.

18:07.419 --> 18:11.590
And we see, you know, Nebula and Gamora
as the way they are now,

18:11.757 --> 18:14.885
and they've changed roles
from what they were in Guardians 1.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.303
Old you would have
never done this.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.763
You had a purpose
higher than yourself.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.641
A calling to help people. That's why
you left Thanos and formed the Guardians.

18:20.808 --> 18:24.103
Except I didn't form the Guardians,
and I barely left Thanos.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.231
Whoever it was
that you were in love with...

18:28.565 --> 18:29.566
it wasn't me.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.652
It sounds more like her.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.820
-Her?
-What?

18:32.986 --> 18:35.989
-That's ridiculous! Don't even...
-Do not bring me into this.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.661
GILLAN: Me and Zoe are so bonded

18:40.828 --> 18:43.872
through the experience
of playing these characters. It's crazy.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.167
Like we feel really protective
over the sister relationship

18:47.334 --> 18:48.919
and how it's portrayed on screen

18:49.086 --> 18:51.296
and it just really matters
to the both of us.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.508
It's something that
we just connected with a lot.

18:54.716 --> 18:59.179
And over the years
it's resulted in a really special bond

18:59.346 --> 19:00.806
between the two of us.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.642
Hopefully, she agrees with me. (LAUGHS)

19:03.892 --> 19:06.854
I got an HR complaint
that they're too giggly.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.398
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Oh, he's right.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.026
I would have loved
to have seen just a spin-off

19:13.193 --> 19:14.987
based on that sisterhood.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.405
It's so complex.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.032
It's so controversial. It's, um...

19:20.033 --> 19:22.619
It's also so relatable in a sense that,

19:22.786 --> 19:24.705
not me by personal experience,

19:24.872 --> 19:27.916
but knowing that
there are siblings out there

19:28.083 --> 19:30.002
that have had troubled lives at home,

19:30.669 --> 19:34.173
and managed to survive
because of their kinship,

19:34.339 --> 19:36.508
because of their brotherhood
or their sisterhood.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.926
Tell me something.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.429
In the future...

19:41.972 --> 19:43.807
what happens to you and me?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.227
I try to kill you.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.856
Several times.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.235
But eventually, we become friends.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.198
We become sisters.

19:59.364 --> 20:03.118
Karen is a very talented actor,
and she transforms herself.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.039
Nebula and Karen could not be
any more different from each other.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.626
I'm covered in goo because we've been
climbing through a gooey surface.

20:13.462 --> 20:18.467
(LAUGHING) And we're absolutely
head to toe covered in goo

20:18.634 --> 20:20.552
and it's Wednesday

20:21.136 --> 20:23.555
and it's our first day
back after the holidays,

20:23.722 --> 20:26.308
and we're just getting our goo right on.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.394
Her voice for Nebula
is like Clint Eastwood.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.771
And then they say, "Cut,"

20:30.938 --> 20:33.065
and she sounds to me like
Mrs. Doubtfire.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.358
She's like this Scottish...

20:34.524 --> 20:36.401
(IN CHILD-LIKE VOICE) Ooh, was it...

20:36.568 --> 20:37.694
And then she goes into...

20:37.861 --> 20:39.655
(IN DEEP VOICE)
"Okay, now I'm Nebula."

20:39.821 --> 20:43.116
(LAUGHING)

20:45.244 --> 20:46.245
Oh, dear.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.373
I've always found her pretty funny
because she's so serious.

20:49.915 --> 20:54.169
And I think that if anyone's that serious,
there is an element of comedy to it.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.214
But she's now becoming a lot funnier.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.757
(GRUNTING)

20:58.924 --> 21:00.509
-Push down on it.
-What?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.719
-Push it down.
-I am pushing down on it.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.054
Push the button.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.890
-You're pushing the keyhole.
-The what?

21:07.057 --> 21:10.185
There's a button under the handle,
press that in.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.105
(GRUNTS AND SIGHS) Okay. Now what?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.690
Open the (BLEEP) door.

21:17.109 --> 21:21.363
That is a stupid design,
and your instructions were very unclear.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.160
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

21:27.327 --> 21:29.830
That is the next step in our evolution.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.374
More powerful, more beautiful...

21:33.125 --> 21:36.628
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.464
I think I shall call him...

21:41.341 --> 21:42.342
Adam.

21:42.843 --> 21:46.722
SARA: Adam Warlock has been sent
by his mother, Ayesha, to capture Rocket.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.098
Hey!

21:49.182 --> 21:50.434
Where did you go, squirrel?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.477
And what we've come to learn
is actually...

21:52.769 --> 21:55.856
that is at the behest
of the High Evolutionary

21:56.023 --> 21:57.774
who was the creator
of the Sovereign people.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.568
You get this wonderful pair

21:59.735 --> 22:02.612
of Ayesha played by Elizabeth Debicki

22:02.779 --> 22:05.198
and Adam Warlock, played by Will Poulter.

22:05.532 --> 22:09.161
I am the Warlock, Mum,
and I am done with being ordered around.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.413
The best way to describe Adam Warlock

22:11.747 --> 22:16.293
would be in the words
of the High Evolutionary.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.671
He was created with the hopes
that he would be

22:19.838 --> 22:22.215
the apogee of the Sovereign people.

22:22.382 --> 22:26.136
And he comes out
a little early from his cocoon,

22:26.303 --> 22:28.430
and he's somewhat half-baked.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.145
Who threw this thing at me?

22:35.437 --> 22:37.230
-Shut up.
-(WHIMPERING)

22:38.190 --> 22:39.191
Baby.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.861
The way that James wrote
the character of Adam Warlock,

22:43.028 --> 22:47.282
it really did require an actor
who could handle both humor

22:47.449 --> 22:50.869
but also some of the weightier moments
of the film.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.788
Right at the beginning of the movie,

22:52.954 --> 22:56.708
you realize Adam Warlock is not a guy
that you want to mess with.

23:03.006 --> 23:06.468
I've had an opportunity to work with
the stunt team here on a bunch of things,

23:06.635 --> 23:08.345
which has been a real treat.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.846
The wire work,

23:10.013 --> 23:13.016
the various rigs to make it look like
you're flying, that's fun.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.810
I've had a couple of flying dreams

23:14.976 --> 23:18.021
that have really improved
in terms of their quality

23:18.188 --> 23:19.981
since training on this movie,

23:20.148 --> 23:23.568
because I feel like I got as close
to the real thing as one can get.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.364
Who is that maniac?

23:28.031 --> 23:30.951
Some super douche with ray gun hands,
I don't frickin' know.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.495
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

23:37.541 --> 23:38.875
WILL POULTER: For Knowhere,

23:38.959 --> 23:41.628
they practically created
a whole city right there.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.921
It was unbelievable.

23:44.297 --> 23:47.509
Now, of course,
we had Knowhere in Guardians Vol.1.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.678
It was a pretty simple set.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.304
We actually built it outdoors.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.224
And this is quite an upgrade to that.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.814
This is truly an extraordinary set.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.150
I feel they could take this piece by piece

24:03.316 --> 24:05.652
and put it in Disneyland,
and it would be a ride.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.071
It's unbelievable. It's three stories.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.533
Exceptional craftsmanship
and, you know...

24:12.242 --> 24:14.369
The opening of the movie
takes place right here,

24:14.494 --> 24:16.746
and, man-o-man, I don't know,

24:16.913 --> 24:20.041
they didn't spare any expense
when building this set.

24:20.208 --> 24:25.589
And we've got, I don't know,
probably over 100 extras,

24:25.755 --> 24:26.840
full alien makeup.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.258
Show yourselves, guys.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.927
Look over here. Wave.
Look at some of these folks.

24:31.344 --> 24:34.890
Look at that makeup.
You in the blue, how long did that take?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.058
WOMAN: Two seconds. It's a mask.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.226
-Oh.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

24:38.393 --> 24:40.103
Two hours! We're going to fix it.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.356
It took nine hours
in the makeup trailer, uh,

24:43.607 --> 24:46.443
just because she's a diva
and needed to get a foot massage.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.195
-It's just a mask?
-Yeah.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.489
-This one takes two hours.
-Two hours.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.782
-MAN: Three hours.
-Three hours over here.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.368
See? A lot of manpower. But, hey...

24:56.578 --> 24:58.288
it's the final Guardians of the Galaxy,

24:58.455 --> 25:00.874
so we went big, you know.
Go big or go home.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.709
Welcome to Knowhere.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.004
This is, uh, Rocket's...

25:07.839 --> 25:10.091
apartment here.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.888
He's got all sorts of
little machinery parts.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.640
You can tell what his life is all about,

25:16.806 --> 25:19.518
machines, things like that
and building stuff.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.311
That's his bed.

25:22.604 --> 25:26.358
And this is where he puts
the Zune in the cradle

25:27.150 --> 25:30.237
listening to Heart.

25:30.403 --> 25:34.658
And then this is where Adam Warlock
is going to smash through over here,

25:34.824 --> 25:38.161
grab him here, smash through that wall...

25:38.995 --> 25:41.623
Boom! Boom! We're gonna shoot all that.

25:41.790 --> 25:46.253
And then smashes
into Peter Quill's bedroom.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.464
Smashes through here.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.300
He's got all this old video game stuff

25:52.467 --> 25:55.136
that he's collected
from junkers and Earth stuff.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.473
Smashes through there
and smashes through there,

25:58.974 --> 26:01.518
going directly above Quill

26:01.685 --> 26:03.353
who has moved his...

26:03.520 --> 26:05.772
Uh, you can see he's moved
the cassette player

26:05.939 --> 26:08.358
from the Milano into his bedroom.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.696
And then smashes
and they land on that roof over there.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.284
Oh, hell.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.955
Here on Knowhere,
we see Kraglin and Cosmo.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.416
Oh, yeah, we introduce that dynamic duo.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.128
-(ZAPPING AND BEEPING)
-(SHRIEKS)

26:28.295 --> 26:29.963
COSMO: Bozhe moi, Kraglin.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.758
-You must know will never learn.
-You think you could do better?

26:34.384 --> 26:35.385
COSMO: Da.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.970
We gender swapped Cosmo.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.431
-I believe in the comics...
-'Cause Cosmo is a man.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.726
HATT: Yeah, and Cosmo's obviously
based on the dogs

26:42.892 --> 26:47.147
that the Russians sent to space
at the beginning of the Space Race.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.150
I think one in particular was Laika,
who was a female dog.

26:50.317 --> 26:54.487
That's why we did the gender swap
in honor of Laika,

26:54.654 --> 26:57.157
the original dog
that went to went to space...

26:57.324 --> 26:59.993
-Dog cosmonaut.
-...and did not come back, sadly.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.705
GUNN: I always wanted to pull in Cosmo.
I just didn't know how to do it.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.291
You know, it made just sense
that she would show up

27:06.458 --> 27:11.880
because we already knew that Cosmo
was in Knowhere from the first movie,

27:12.297 --> 27:17.802
so being able to then, um, have her become
an actual character was important.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.305
Nebula? Nebula, did you hear?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.974
He called me a bad dog,
and he refused to take it back.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.311
We actually did
a pretty wide search for Cosmo.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.105
We auditioned a lot of different actors.

27:29.272 --> 27:32.150
Cosmo was being played
by the very talented Maria Bakalova.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.279
GUNN: She is just always just very sweet
and very good natured.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.490
Very open with her emotions.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.200
Very exuberant.

27:40.367 --> 27:45.372
She has that dog-like quality in her
that we all love about dogs.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.668
Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.961
over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.171
Aye, comrade.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.424
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.
I have a contact near there.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.802
-Maybe they can help us get in.
-Contact him.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.179
Let's go save our friend.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.565
BETH MICKLE: James really cares about
everything being in camera,

28:12.649 --> 28:15.402
which is incredible from
a production designer's standpoint,

28:15.568 --> 28:18.363
a set-design standpoint,
that's music to our ears.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.370
In the first draft
for Guardians of the Galaxy 3,

28:25.537 --> 28:29.457
our Orgoscope planet was originally
scripted as a gyroscopic planet,

28:29.624 --> 28:33.253
so the first week or two, my initial
research was all going toward that.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.339
James and I started talking
about what happened on this planet,

28:36.506 --> 28:39.342
and it's all genetic research,
and it's all experimentation.

28:39.509 --> 28:43.096
And so he felt, you know,
that it might be more interesting

28:43.263 --> 28:45.682
if the planet itself was entirely organic,

28:45.849 --> 28:48.435
as if the scientist had grown it
from the beginning,

28:48.601 --> 28:50.353
and that was the origin of it.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.732
And it really rooted it,
in an interesting story point

28:53.898 --> 28:56.693
that made sense
with what they're doing on this planet.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.362
But then it gave this incredible challenge

28:59.529 --> 29:03.158
to myself in the art department
and Judianna in the costume department

29:03.324 --> 29:06.745
to try to come up with a planet
that's entirely organically grown,

29:06.911 --> 29:09.748
but still a place
that you want to spend time. (CHUCKLES)

29:12.333 --> 29:13.334
If you can look here,

29:13.501 --> 29:16.629
you can see your spacesuits floating
by that window outside.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.339
-Ha!
-Right?

29:18.506 --> 29:19.549
Damn it!

29:20.049 --> 29:21.676
GUNN: We are in the Orgoscope,

29:21.843 --> 29:26.014
which is both the most beautiful
and most disgusting set we've ever had

29:26.181 --> 29:27.515
in the Guardians universe.

29:27.682 --> 29:31.686
It looks like, uh,
kind of a wonderful colonoscopy

29:31.853 --> 29:33.938
if you're walking through it.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.775
But... (LAUGHING) So...

29:36.941 --> 29:39.027
But it's... It's...

29:39.194 --> 29:43.907
Yeah, I mean, this is a...
You know, I wanted to create a place

29:44.073 --> 29:46.951
that is architecturally different

29:47.160 --> 29:49.329
than other places we've seen so far.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.165
And the way the Orgoscope was created

29:52.332 --> 29:54.250
is they actually grow the materials.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.127
So it's composed of bone,

29:56.294 --> 30:00.924
it's composed of organs they use,
you know, organs and flesh.

30:01.382 --> 30:05.303
The suits that they're wearing
are composed of like a sort of flesh

30:05.470 --> 30:08.515
that's grown that insulates them
and protects them.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.017
(GRUNTING)

30:11.226 --> 30:13.978
GUNN: Orgosentries were something that...

30:14.145 --> 30:17.649
I thought of them at first as maybe
being a little bit more crab-like,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.818
and then I saw the crab costumes

30:19.984 --> 30:21.945
and it looked like
things that we'd seen before.

30:22.111 --> 30:25.156
And so I said,
"Well, what if they're made of flesh?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.784
"Like, they grow these costumes."

30:27.951 --> 30:32.789
And Shane and the team over at Legacy
came up with this crazy costume

30:32.956 --> 30:36.125
that looks like something
out of a French art film,

30:36.292 --> 30:40.630
or it looks like one of those sumo
wrestler costumes that you put on

30:40.797 --> 30:44.634
and, you know, it protects you through
the actual girth of the costume.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.344
And it isn't shaped at all

30:46.511 --> 30:51.099
what we think of as the sort of
hyper-masculine tough shape

30:51.266 --> 30:54.727
that we think of soldiers
as often being in movies.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.105
It's very poofy with the big butt.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.149
And it's great to see Nathan Fillion
playing Major Karja

31:00.316 --> 31:04.571
walking around like
he's the most hardcore dude in the world.

31:05.238 --> 31:06.322
Let's go, dummies.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.619
MICKLE: The set that we're shooting
today is Orgo Space Park,

31:11.786 --> 31:15.331
and we're shooting a scene where Drax
and Mantis fight all the Orgosentries.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.834
MAN: Here we go. Ready and action!

31:18.001 --> 31:21.588
We did some pretty fun things
at the Orgoscope Space Park.

31:21.921 --> 31:24.132
Dave Bautista, he's a badass.

31:24.299 --> 31:28.303
We did come in trying to give Mantis
a little different kind of a flare,

31:28.636 --> 31:31.848
so we came up with some really fun
alternate options for them.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.017
-You're a kitty cat.
-Meow.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.518
(GRUNTS)

31:36.811 --> 31:38.021
You feel like dancing.

31:38.897 --> 31:43.651
We're always trying to push the envelope
and do what we think is unique.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.446
We just push it, you know,
we just have fun with it.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.657
(BOTH SCREAMING)

31:51.075 --> 31:52.327
MAN: Cut! Cut, cut.

31:53.786 --> 31:59.709
Pom is... Out of all of us,
she's probably the most artistic, I think.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.963
She's really, like,
almost a throwback performer.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.715
She's almost from a different era.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.300
(IN GROWLING VOICE) No!

32:07.467 --> 32:09.218
-Hello.
-Hello.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.845
PRATT: She's like a thrill seeker.

32:11.012 --> 32:14.223
She's off parachuting and horseback riding

32:14.390 --> 32:16.017
and doing all of this crazy stuff.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.311
-I'm learning French now.
-(APPLAUDING)

32:18.478 --> 32:20.188
PRATT: Learning all of these martial arts.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.898
Can I do more kicking, though?

32:21.981 --> 32:23.650
Kick him in the face?

32:23.900 --> 32:27.695
(CHUCKLES) Pom is probably my...
She's my favorite Guardian.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.447
Mantis is my favorite Guardian.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.326
I... (LAUGHS) I think not only is she
a brilliant actress,

32:33.493 --> 32:35.912
but what she does
with this character is so fun.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.123
And she has such a sweet
innocence about her.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.627
But also, she's really...
You know, she can be a sarcastic little...

32:42.794 --> 32:45.171
-Hello!
-(LAUGHING)

32:45.546 --> 32:48.383
We've really kind of dove into that,
you know,

32:48.549 --> 32:50.301
that sibling rivalry.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.720
Get in there and say,
"Are you kidding me?"

32:52.887 --> 32:54.180
-In his face?
-Yeah.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.850
I love working with Dave.
He's amazing. He's like soft-spoken,

32:58.017 --> 33:01.479
but also he can be very loud sometimes,
like acting-wise.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.689
Ha!

33:02.939 --> 33:06.067
You're lucky
I was able to knock down that door...

33:06.234 --> 33:09.195
And also for what he stands for,
and I really respect that.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.864
But he's also very sweet,
you know, and so funny.

33:12.031 --> 33:15.535
And the dynamic between the characters
is so well written by James.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.120
We just have fun with it.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.747
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.041
You made me fall in love with my sock.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.334
Well, that was funny.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.712
It is a majestic performance by Dave.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.881
Drax is ridiculous,
but also we totally believe him.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.717
He's completely believable

33:30.883 --> 33:32.260
and emotionally grounded.

33:32.760 --> 33:37.140
And we get to see, really, his origins
in this movie in a way as well.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.476
I had a little girl like you.
You know what she used to like?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.521
She liked when I made monkey noises.

33:46.899 --> 33:49.777
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.864
-(MIMICKING MONKEY POORLY)
-(GIRLS LAUGH)

33:53.114 --> 33:56.200
PRATT: I can't imagine anyone else
playing Drax. It's totally Dave.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.162
It has been Dave
since the moment he walked in

33:59.328 --> 34:01.622
and he and I screen tested together.
Everybody knew.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.667
You'll get to kill this guy,
but you got to help us sell this.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.962
Which means, no matter
what I tell you to do, you do it. Okay?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.675
Or we can decide together
is what I'm saying.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.513
Well... for the most part,
you'll make the decisions, okay?

34:17.680 --> 34:18.848
(DAVE LAUGHS)

34:19.057 --> 34:21.142
PRATT: I start to get sentimental
thinking about

34:21.309 --> 34:24.270
the fact that over the past ten years,
we've spent so much time together.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.856
Granted, he's been in grey and red
makeup the whole time,

34:27.023 --> 34:29.150
so without his makeup on,
I don't recognize him,

34:29.317 --> 34:30.985
but we've spent a lot of time together.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.030
Five movies, press tours, premieres

34:34.197 --> 34:35.865
and to think that none of those things

34:36.032 --> 34:38.242
are going to be happening
in our lives anymore,

34:38.409 --> 34:41.037
I hope that doesn't mean that
we don't spend time together.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.247
Because I'd miss him.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.083
I got your back, big boy.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.251
Okay? I got your back.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.755
I won't touch you again.
That's the last time I touch you.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.757
Okay. I'm glad I did that.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

35:02.100 --> 35:04.435
HATT: The High Evo
has been continuing his work.

35:04.602 --> 35:08.231
You know, he's been building planets,
populating them with species,

35:08.397 --> 35:09.398
and we get to see one.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.859
We go to Counter-Earth,
which is populated

35:12.026 --> 35:13.736
with what we call the Humanimals.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.531
And it's like a Island of Dr. Moreau.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.743
It's weird and wonderful.

35:20.910 --> 35:24.539
And Alexei and Shane Mahan

35:24.705 --> 35:26.749
and Lindsay MacGowan of Legacy

35:26.916 --> 35:30.169
have done incredible work
bringing those characters to life.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.765
Okay. Great.
All right, let's see that again.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.519
PRATT: You've got bat people
and turtle people,

35:47.186 --> 35:50.398
and rabbit people,
and these, like, kind of a warthog people.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.108
-The adorable baby.
-I know.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.985
-He's gorgeous. He looks like...
-Yeah.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.529
PRATT: But they're all rocking
clothes from the '80s.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.822
It's the funniest thing.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.075
GUNN: We had a huge makeup team
creating all of these characters

36:01.242 --> 36:04.370
and sort of doing it in a way
that we had A's, B's and C's.

36:04.537 --> 36:08.207
A's were the really full done makeups

36:08.374 --> 36:10.918
that were in the front
that were going to be featured.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.045
B's were a little bit further back.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.714
You might see glimpses of them,

36:14.881 --> 36:17.216
but we're not going to do
close-ups of them.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.011
And then the C's wore
kind of, more simple masks

36:20.178 --> 36:23.347
that people could pull on
and we could put way in the background.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.558
That all had to be very planned out.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.936
It was like, in this scene,
how many Humanimals are in this shot?

36:29.103 --> 36:30.646
How many are in this shot?

36:30.813 --> 36:34.317
How many are in all of this scene
and just figuring all of that out,

36:34.483 --> 36:37.612
so that we could, you know,
make the movie work as well as possible.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.780
This is the perfect society?

36:43.743 --> 36:45.828
Those Humanimal days were absolutely huge.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.872
Our background tent was gigantic.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.249
We have all of our trailers packed.

36:50.958 --> 36:54.712
All of them wore teeth, contacts,
they all have hands and all that stuff.

36:54.879 --> 36:58.507
It was a big undertaking for us,
for Legacy.

36:58.674 --> 37:03.346
Legacy Effects,
they absolutely made just amazing pieces.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.097
Beautiful hair work,

37:05.640 --> 37:07.058
custom wigs for all of them,

37:07.225 --> 37:08.434
custom hairpieces.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.937
Having them all on set was super exciting

37:11.103 --> 37:13.356
because it was just
so many different looks

37:13.522 --> 37:14.941
and they were all practical.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.320
They made a cassowary bird.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.114
It was, I think,
the postal worker, Blue Jay.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.951
Those were really, really cool.
They turned out amazing.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.286
But the R&D behind that is really cool.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.623
They have a lot of 3D printed elements
with magnets

37:30.790 --> 37:33.793
and the beak and the whole locking jaw,

37:33.960 --> 37:36.796
so the actor gets to drive
the movement of the whole beak.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.839
Groot, full kaiju!

37:39.006 --> 37:41.175
-Not full kaiju!
-I am...

37:41.342 --> 37:42.677
-Groot!
-Back up.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.428
No, not kaiju!

37:44.595 --> 37:45.680
Groot, down!

37:45.846 --> 37:47.515
There's no reason to be afraid.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.058
We're not here to harm you.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.187
(SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)

37:53.354 --> 37:55.690
GUNN: It was originally written
as "vampire bat family,"

37:55.856 --> 37:58.693
and then I said, "But you know,
this is just a placeholder,

37:58.859 --> 38:02.029
"because let's go through
all the different designs and see

38:02.196 --> 38:05.574
"which design
is the best for this family."

38:05.741 --> 38:09.620
And I ended up liking
the vampire bats the best.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.038
Her look especially.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.166
She's fantastic in that role.
That's a real language.

38:14.333 --> 38:18.629
I created a real language
that has grammar and everything to it.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.090
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

38:22.049 --> 38:25.136
I love seeing the worlds
that ends up being created

38:25.303 --> 38:28.389
because having an actor in makeup
doing the role,

38:28.556 --> 38:30.182
you can see it, you can feel it.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.726
It's the way to go.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.478
There's more makeup applications

38:34.645 --> 38:37.523
on this film than any movie in history.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.442
They beat out The Grinch.

38:39.608 --> 38:42.403
Which, of course, every character
in The Grinch is a Whovillian.

38:42.570 --> 38:45.406
-PRATT: Yeah.
-GUNN: And so, we have more than them.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.868
It's crazy.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.954
Guinness Book of World Records.
Way to go.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.423
MONEYMAKER: The sets we're shooting today
were scripted as being separate sets.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.926
It was the Batch 89 caged hallways
where they're keeping the animals,

39:06.093 --> 39:08.512
the cloisters
where they keep the children,

39:08.679 --> 39:11.640
the Evolutionary Chamber where
the High Evo does his experiments.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.894
But we thought it'd be interesting
to link the sets together

39:15.061 --> 39:17.313
so that you can see
from one set to the next

39:17.480 --> 39:19.732
and make the world feel bigger
and more cohesive.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.526
And so, now, James is taking
great advantage of it,

39:22.693 --> 39:25.780
and he's having the choreography
of his final battle take place,

39:25.946 --> 39:28.574
starts in the hallway,
comes down through a vestibule,

39:28.741 --> 39:30.659
lands into our Evolutionary Chamber,

39:30.826 --> 39:33.537
and it lets the choreography
sprawl around the space.

39:33.704 --> 39:37.416
And we're about to shoot
the big finale of the film.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.835
Ready? And action!

39:41.253 --> 39:44.131
KLEMENTIEFF: I really enjoyed
working with Heidi Moneymaker

39:44.298 --> 39:46.217
who's been stunt coordinating
for the movie,

39:46.384 --> 39:48.886
and she used to be
Scarlett Johansson's stunt double,

39:49.053 --> 39:52.640
so she's really, really skilled herself,

39:52.807 --> 39:56.310
and also she's amazing at
you know, choreographing the whole thing.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.813
(GRUNTING)

39:58.979 --> 40:01.482
She wanted to make sure
that I got to do some action

40:01.649 --> 40:05.069
because she knew that I loved doing it
and I was craving to do it.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.571
So that was really great
to get to work with her for sure.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.950
It's fun. I'm kicking someone in the face.
Fake kicking.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.370
You want to see all the Guardians
fight together at one time,

40:14.537 --> 40:17.331
and a lot of these movies
are about pulling them apart,

40:17.498 --> 40:19.583
coming back together,
pulling them apart, you know?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.086
Then we get a moment
where they're all together,

40:22.253 --> 40:24.422
but even then,
they're not usually fully together,

40:24.588 --> 40:25.965
and this was them,

40:26.132 --> 40:29.510
really, fully together, working as a team.

40:29.677 --> 40:34.098
This was just a labor of love and passion
for I think everybody on this set.

40:34.515 --> 40:38.018
We've been planning it and working it out
and redoing it and redoing it

40:38.185 --> 40:41.188
since probably September, October,
which is like six months.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.649
It took us a while
to get the wire gags down

40:43.816 --> 40:45.526
because they were very complicated.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.987
And I think in the beginning of this,
I thought,

40:48.154 --> 40:51.407
"This could not go well for us."
(CHUCKLES)

40:51.574 --> 40:55.119
And it ended up being visually
one of my favorite things that we've done.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.581
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

40:58.747 --> 41:02.084
GILLAN: What's cool about these movies
is they do a previs of the whole thing

41:02.251 --> 41:04.462
and they even shoot it
with the stunt doubles

41:04.628 --> 41:06.797
from all the angles that
they will be shooting it from.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.301
So you kind of get to see
a version of the movie shot on an iPhone

41:10.468 --> 41:13.512
and you think, "I'm doing that
and that's how I'm going to look,

41:13.679 --> 41:17.141
"but slightly worse because I'm not
a trained martial artist." (LAUGHS)

41:17.224 --> 41:19.018
PRATT: This technology is
constantly emerging.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.729
What we have now
in terms of the cameras that we can use,

41:21.896 --> 41:24.482
they are incredibly light.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.110
So they can be handheld,
and because they can be handheld,

41:28.277 --> 41:30.404
you can design action sequences

41:30.571 --> 41:32.615
that are really
unlike anything done before

41:32.781 --> 41:36.911
because the camera operator becomes
just as big a part of the stunt sequence

41:37.077 --> 41:39.580
as the stunt performers and the actors.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.837
GILLAN: At one point,
the camera operator was on wires

41:47.004 --> 41:50.799
and he got hoisted up over me
as I was like being punched in the face.

41:52.801 --> 41:56.347
So that was really intricate, actually,
and required a lot of rehearsal.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.558
And so, we just spent a lot of time
getting that right.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.645
It was quite nerve-racking on the day
because in a one shot,

42:02.811 --> 42:05.523
you need to get
everything perfect within one take.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.191
You can do it a few times,

42:07.358 --> 42:09.777
but the pressure is definitely on.

42:09.944 --> 42:13.322
When you guys come together,
there's a moment between you two

42:13.489 --> 42:15.741
where you're the leaders of this team,

42:15.824 --> 42:17.076
totally in charge.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.285
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.287
Need to get help moving the rope.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.206
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So I'll be like...

42:37.846 --> 42:40.516

42:45.563 --> 42:49.608
James wanted to showcase each character,
like, a couple beats from each character,

42:49.775 --> 42:52.403
and we flow from character
to character to character.

42:52.861 --> 42:55.489
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

43:16.594 --> 43:19.013
Chris really brought a lot to it.

43:19.179 --> 43:23.183
He loves to come into train
and he really learns his choreo.

43:23.350 --> 43:25.394
And then, whatever we give him,

43:25.561 --> 43:29.189
he always ups it
because then he's Star-Lord.

43:29.356 --> 43:31.108
So, like, we give him something

43:31.275 --> 43:35.571
and then he just slaps
all these additional layers on top of it

43:35.738 --> 43:37.114
and we're always like... Oh!

43:38.490 --> 43:39.575
What's up, everybody?

43:39.742 --> 43:43.746
So we're getting into shooting
some pretty cool action sequences

43:44.204 --> 43:47.041
that'll basically take us
into the third act.

43:47.207 --> 43:50.377
We've got Chris Romrell
up on this podium up there.

43:51.086 --> 43:53.547
And he's sort of modeling, uh...

43:54.882 --> 43:57.968
what he wants...
what they want me to do.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.054
It always looks better when he does it,

44:00.220 --> 44:03.349
but I'm going to try my best
to make it work. So I'll be...

44:03.515 --> 44:07.561
You can't tell from this camera angle but
that's several hundred feet in the air.

44:08.228 --> 44:09.772
I'll be hoisted up there.

44:10.522 --> 44:14.693
They like to use these wires for Romrell,
but I won't have them.

44:15.235 --> 44:16.987
I insist on not having wires.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.489
That's all about you flying.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.367
Am I going to have to have
any core strength for this?

44:21.533 --> 44:22.868
-Nope.
-Oh, good.

44:22.951 --> 44:25.245
(ALL LAUGHING)

44:26.789 --> 44:28.082
-You're ready?
-We're ready.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.249
Are you guys good?

44:29.458 --> 44:31.001
-Henry? All right.
-Okay.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.628
-PRATT: Raise the meat.
-All right.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.964
PRATT: They have these LED panels
giving off the light,

44:36.131 --> 44:38.550
basically creating
the effect of fire all around us

44:38.717 --> 44:40.511
and then they'll animate all of that.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.554
I insisted that we use real fire.

44:42.721 --> 44:44.348
They kind of chickened out,

44:44.515 --> 44:46.725
and so, I guess
we can't burn the place down.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.977
And, yeah, this is just
one day in the life.

44:49.144 --> 44:51.355
It's taken a few hours to get this set up,

44:51.522 --> 44:54.525
and it will be three seconds in the movie.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.194
So, standby.

45:04.451 --> 45:05.452
Did that...

45:06.370 --> 45:08.872
...look cool?

45:10.499 --> 45:12.418
(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

45:23.595 --> 45:26.932
To be reunited with this Guardians family
for Vol. 3, it's...

45:28.350 --> 45:31.061
It's really special.
And I know that it's rare

45:31.228 --> 45:33.647
to have a rapport like we have,

45:33.814 --> 45:36.525
as many years
as we've put in the trenches together.

45:36.692 --> 45:40.070
Still very much a family,
just like the story, really.

45:40.237 --> 45:43.741
What makes it different this time around
is we know that it's coming to an end.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.243
So I think each of us is,

45:47.494 --> 45:49.872
you know, processing that in our own way.

45:50.164 --> 45:53.709
Ahhh! This is too upsetting in a good way.

45:55.836 --> 45:59.173
There is a bittersweet taste
because we know that

45:59.339 --> 46:01.800
it's the last
Guardians of the Galaxy movie.

46:02.426 --> 46:05.721
We're going to have one more scene
with all the Guardians together.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.765
Chris reminded me that yesterday.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.017
So that's going to be very emotional.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.310
Yeah, that's it.

46:11.477 --> 46:16.899
That's the last shot
with who I basically consider the,

46:17.065 --> 46:19.485
you know, full Guardians.

46:19.651 --> 46:21.153
Chris and Zoe,

46:21.320 --> 46:24.198
and Dave, Karen, Pom and Sean.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.911
And these are the guys who have been
together with me for nine years now.

46:29.077 --> 46:32.164
And I love each of you guys.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.500
We still have another day
of filming together,

46:34.666 --> 46:36.460
just not in the same scene.

46:36.835 --> 46:37.878
-Um...
-Aw.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.588
So I really do love all you guys.

46:39.755 --> 46:40.881
And honest to God,

46:41.048 --> 46:44.134
I couldn't be luckier to have...

46:44.301 --> 46:46.553
I hate doing this in front of the camera,
but I'll do it

46:46.720 --> 46:49.014
because I wanted to say
to you guys earlier

46:49.181 --> 46:51.600
that I've been so incredibly blessed

46:51.934 --> 46:53.477
to have this group of people,

46:53.644 --> 46:55.813
and I tell everyone I meet all the time,

46:55.979 --> 46:57.648
as my partners on this journey.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.775
It has just been an amazing thing

46:59.942 --> 47:03.529
because I really, honestly,
love each of you guys so deeply.

47:03.695 --> 47:06.615
As people, as performers, and as friends.

47:06.782 --> 47:07.950
And I love you all.

on this journey.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.925
and knowing that
there's a little bit of finality

47:25.092 --> 47:30.514
to how we're approaching
these final scenes is really...

47:31.348 --> 47:32.349
It's emotional.

47:32.516 --> 47:36.812
I think that we're all savoring
every moment in a way.

47:36.979 --> 47:40.899
In some ways,
the set has been more fun as a result.

47:41.066 --> 47:44.486
I think we've...
We've laughed as much as ever

47:44.945 --> 47:48.240
because we know
that there's an end point.

47:48.407 --> 47:51.243
-Hey, James. Love you.
-I love you.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.540

I mean, who gets to do this, you know?

48:06.508 --> 48:07.509
Who gets to, like,

48:07.676 --> 48:12.306
make something that audiences seem to love

48:12.472 --> 48:14.850
and that we can feel proud of,

48:15.017 --> 48:17.853
and know that we put our hearts into it?

GUNN: If people ask me really,
honestly, truly,

48:20.188 --> 48:22.983
what's my favorite part
of making Guardians of the Galaxy,

-it's working with my brother.
-(CREW APPLAUDING)

48:26.528 --> 48:28.822
He's a great brother and a great friend,

48:28.989 --> 48:31.992
but most of all,
it's just been so fun to watch him.

48:35.078 --> 48:38.999
The first time I heard about the project
of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1,

48:39.166 --> 48:43.253
I had gotten a call from my agent,
and she just said, without any context,

48:43.670 --> 48:45.547
"Are you willing to shave your head?"

48:45.964 --> 48:47.633
And I was like, "What for?"

48:47.799 --> 48:49.801
And she said, "For a Marvel movie."

48:49.968 --> 48:51.053
And then I said, "Yes."

48:51.219 --> 48:53.555
I might have done something
a little bit crazy.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.143

48:59.561 --> 49:02.022
I thought I was going to be filming
for eight days,

49:02.189 --> 49:04.149
and then I thought
that was going to be it.

49:04.316 --> 49:09.029
So ten years ago,
I stood in my office with Karen Gillan,

49:09.196 --> 49:13.158
and I told her,
"This role isn't so big in this movie,

49:13.325 --> 49:16.870
"but I plan on her being
a Guardian of the Galaxy in the future."

49:17.371 --> 49:21.375
The kind of things I tell people
all the time and I'm always wrong.

49:21.541 --> 49:25.128
But this person really came through
and just has shown us how great she is

49:25.671 --> 49:28.215
and what a team player she is
to have to come in

49:28.382 --> 49:30.175
all these days so early.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.427
And I love her and I'm going to miss her.

49:32.594 --> 49:34.721
And that is a trilogy wrap

49:34.888 --> 49:38.183

This whole experience has enriched my life
in so many different ways.

49:43.522 --> 49:44.773
I mean, like...

49:44.940 --> 49:47.776
It was my first big movie
that I'd ever done.

49:47.943 --> 49:49.152
And how lucky am I

49:49.319 --> 49:52.823
that it was as good a movie
as Guardians of the Galaxy was?

49:52.990 --> 49:56.368
And not only that,
but I was given this incredible character

49:56.535 --> 49:59.538
that I got to explore
over the course of six films.

49:59.705 --> 50:00.747
You okay?

50:06.420 --> 50:09.506
-Is it okay to be sad?
-Mmm-hmm.

50:10.298 --> 50:12.968
It's the end of a journey
'cause this started my career.

and then we think,
"But this is the last one." (LAUGHS)

SALDANA: To live within
the Marvel universe

50:53.550 --> 50:55.594
has been nothing but a treat. It's...

50:56.178 --> 50:58.388
It's a part of my legacy

50:58.555 --> 51:02.350
that I will so proudly take on with me,
you know?

51:02.517 --> 51:05.645
And... And I hope
that my children are proud.

51:05.812 --> 51:07.564
You know, I have three little boys

51:07.731 --> 51:12.235
and they are already becoming
die-hard fans of these characters.

51:12.402 --> 51:15.781
When I first went to Marvel
and I pitched Guardians of the Galaxy,

51:15.947 --> 51:17.282
I brought a little book.

51:17.449 --> 51:20.744
I had worked very hard
trying to put this little book together

51:20.911 --> 51:24.998
of all the different pictures
and photo references and all that stuff.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.293
And within that book,
there were all the characters listed

51:28.460 --> 51:30.712
and who I thought
should play those characters.

51:30.879 --> 51:35.050
And, of course, none of those actors
who were in that book

51:35.217 --> 51:37.052
ended up playing the character,

51:37.219 --> 51:39.596
except for Zoe Saldana,

51:39.763 --> 51:42.307
who I met and loved from the beginning.

It makes me feel lucky.

51:51.483 --> 51:53.985
that I look up to and I respect deeply

51:54.861 --> 51:57.239
that live also in this universe, among me.

Every time I feel like
I'm about to fall out of my sorts,

52:00.951 --> 52:05.664
I look around and I see people
that give up so much to be here

52:05.831 --> 52:07.666
because they have a true passion,

52:07.833 --> 52:11.044
a genuine, sincere love
for what we do,

52:11.211 --> 52:14.714

that we are very blessed and very lucky

"Elegant" as a word I use the most
while shooting it,

52:50.167 --> 52:51.877
while writing it, while editing it.

52:52.043 --> 52:53.712
It's got to have elegance to it.

And it's really been rewarding
for me to make this movie,

52:58.675 --> 53:02.387
which is such a personal statement,
because Rocket is me and this is about me.

And then to see an audience react to it

53:07.309 --> 53:10.395
in a way that they have so far,
it's a good feeling for real.

still I'd feel as though
I'd been living the dream,

54:04.658 --> 54:06.243

will stand the test of time,

Like, a visceral reaction,
as if I was seeing my own dead body.

56:35.892 --> 56:38.144
It felt very weird.
Like an out-of-body experience.

Because obviously, it's lifeless,
but it looks so much like me.
