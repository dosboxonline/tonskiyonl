The white guy from IndieWire loved it.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.541
The white woman
from the LA Times, she really loved it.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.625
She kept saying
that I'm the next Spike Lee,

05:13.708 --> 05:16.666
the next Barry Jenkins,
the next John Singleton.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.250
I just looked at her, like,
"What about William Wyler?"

05:19.333 --> 05:23.833
You could tell, for three whole seconds,
she was like, "Was William Wyler Black?"

05:24.333 --> 05:25.958
[scoffs] Sh-yeah!

05:26.041 --> 05:30.958

"Oh… shit. That's racist too."

That shit had me dying.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.666
Marie, that was hilarious.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.791
And she kept stumbling
over her words, saying shit like,

05:40.875 --> 05:43.416
[imitating woman]
"The movie was so emotional."

05:43.916 --> 05:47.791
"I-- Malcolm, I couldn't even
think straight. Oh, my God, Malcolm."

05:47.875 --> 05:50.291
"Just, just, Malcolm. Malcolm."

05:50.375 --> 05:51.375
"Oh."

05:51.458 --> 05:52.500
[chuckles]

05:53.541 --> 05:55.916
Yeah, it was like a super white moment.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.541
What was interesting, though,

05:57.625 --> 06:01.416
was that you can tell that
because I'm Black, as the director,

06:01.500 --> 06:04.625
and the woman
is a Black lead, stars in the film,

06:04.708 --> 06:07.416
she's already trying to frame it
through a political lens,

06:07.500 --> 06:11.125
when in reality, it's a film
about a girl trying to get clean.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.916
Now, are there certain obstacles,
because she's a Black woman?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.625
I mean, hell yeah.

06:16.708 --> 06:19.625
Right? That's reality, too,
but it's not a film about race.

06:20.125 --> 06:24.541
No. It's about shame, it's about guilt,
and how that shit is inescapable.

06:24.625 --> 06:27.875
And it annoys me
that so many of these journalists

06:27.958 --> 06:30.708
can't help but to flex
their college education.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.750
Malcolm, you have a college education.

06:33.541 --> 06:36.875
Yeah, but I'm not academic, baby.
I'm not elitist about my shit.

06:36.958 --> 06:39.416

for the three people

-Mm-hmm.

06:44.916 --> 06:48.458
-Am I a filmmaker, baby? That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

conversation about filmmaking

some white-ass writer

06:54.666 --> 06:58.291

That's different.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.625

that's fundamentally political,

07:43.708 --> 07:46.125
but not everything I do
is political because I'm Black.

would disagree with you.

For real, though, like,
if I decide to make…

07:54.625 --> 07:57.625

it's not because I want to tell a story

07:57.708 --> 08:01.833
about how the building blocks
of the American empire was slave labor.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.958

That shit was heat! Right?

a good review in your life.

that haven't yet been written.

about the white girl from LA Times

08:35.625 --> 08:37.583
'cause she gave you
a bad review that one time.

08:37.666 --> 08:39.416
Aw, she didn't just give a bad review.

to Spike Lee and Barry Jenkins.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.583
-Really.
-How do you know?

12:07.666 --> 12:09.208
-'Cause I just do.
-Really?

12:09.291 --> 12:12.625
She sees how you are with other people.
You're talkative. You're funny.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.333
What can I say? I'm personable.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.416
[chuckles] Right.
Which is what makes her insecure.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.708
What does? Other fucking
human beings with personalities?

12:19.791 --> 12:22.916
[chuckles] No. The fact that
you're not yourself and she sees it.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.333
[blows]

12:24.833 --> 12:26.041
She'll survive.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.958
[Malcolm] Hmm.

12:31.541 --> 12:32.541
So why you angry?

12:32.625 --> 12:33.958
[jazz music becomes louder]

12:34.041 --> 12:35.625
Marie, you're angry.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.875
Marie, what you angry about?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.250
Marie.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.083
-Marie?
-[dish clatters]

12:41.166 --> 12:42.333
Marie!

12:43.458 --> 12:44.291
Marie.

12:46.750 --> 12:47.875
Marie, talk to me.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.541
I promise you, it's not a good idea.
Let's just talk tomorrow.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.958
-But you're upset with me.
-It's not that big of a deal.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.666
I can't go to bed knowing you're angry.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.833
Malcolm, I promise you,

13:10.916 --> 13:13.458
nothing productive
is going to be said tonight.

13:13.541 --> 13:16.000
-How do you know?
-Because I know you.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.833
-What does that mean?
-And I love you.

13:17.916 --> 13:18.958
What does that mean?

13:19.041 --> 13:22.333
It means you are literally incapable
of de-escalating a situation

13:22.416 --> 13:25.125
unless it's work-related.
Even then, it's 50-50.

13:25.208 --> 13:28.208
[blows raspberry] Why is it
that anytime anything good happens,

13:28.291 --> 13:29.833
you have to find something, anything,

13:29.916 --> 13:33.083
the most minor fucking detail
to harp on, to make ugly,

13:33.166 --> 13:36.458
to ensure that there's no reason
to fucking celebrate.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.541
-Really? You wanna go there?
-Yes.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.000
-Okay.
-All right, then. What is it?

13:41.083 --> 13:44.000
-Your speech, Malcolm.
-Oh, give me a break.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.291
You're outside of your mind.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.875
When I said you find the most minor detail
to make it ugly, I meant it.

13:48.958 --> 13:52.958
[grunts] You forgot to thank me, Malcolm.
It's not a minor detail. That's a big one.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.000
But I've thanked you
a million times before.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.250
You know that I'm thankful.
You know I'm appreciative.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.166
You know I made a mistake,
so why turn it into something more?

14:00.250 --> 14:02.666
Because it is more.

14:02.750 --> 14:03.583
What?

14:03.666 --> 14:05.666
It's our entire fucking
relationship in a nutshell.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.083
-Oh, you can't be serious.
-I'm dead serious.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.791
-You're psychotic.
-You're hyperbolic.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.166
I'm not. It's psychotic to think

14:11.250 --> 14:13.458
that forgetting to thank you
is symbolic of anything

14:13.541 --> 14:16.125
other than me legitimately
forgetting to fucking thank you.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.041
You thanked 112 fucking people tonight.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.291
You thanked your mother, your gaffer,
your agents, your third grade teacher,

14:21.375 --> 14:24.166
the usher at the theater when you were 12
and saw whatever the fuck.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.041
-Didn't thank the usher.
-You know what I mean.

14:26.125 --> 14:29.166
You don't have to be sarcastic,
petty and obnoxious about the shit.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.833
I'm sorry. I forgot to thank you.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.750
I am genuinely sorry,

14:32.833 --> 14:36.500
which is why I apologized to you
a thousand times during the movie.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.750
I felt so guilty,
I couldn't concentrate on the movie.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.958
Huh. That's a shame.
You've only seen it 7,000 times.

14:41.041 --> 14:44.166
Every time I'd lean over and said,
"I'm sorry," you said it was fine.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.333
You squeezed my hand and said it was fine.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.916
You said, "I love you.
Don't worry. It's fine."

14:52.125 --> 14:54.666
Well, Malcolm, I changed my mind.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.291
How can you just change your mind?

14:58.375 --> 15:00.541
Honestly, it's pretty fucking easy.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.541
That doesn't seem a little crazy to you?

15:03.708 --> 15:05.208
-Nope.
-It doesn't?

15:05.291 --> 15:07.000
-Nope.
-Why?

15:07.083 --> 15:09.666
Well, because when I was
in the theater, it didn't matter.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.541
Wasn't that big of a deal. It was fine.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.875
Until the after-party,
when every single person,

15:13.958 --> 15:17.416
from your mother to Taylor,
kept coming up to me and going,

15:17.500 --> 15:20.375
"You know, I bet you're probably
a little bit upset right now

15:20.458 --> 15:24.125
because he forgot to thank you,
but you know how much he depends on you."

15:24.208 --> 15:25.666
[Malcolm] Taylor said that?

15:25.750 --> 15:29.000
-Yeah. She told me not to read into it.
-What the hell does that mean?

15:29.083 --> 15:31.458
Funny you should say that.
That's the exact thought I had.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.125
-I didn't cheat on you.
-I didn't ask.

15:33.208 --> 15:34.208
-Just saying--
-Didn't ask.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.583
-Well, I'm just saying--
-I didn't ask.

15:36.666 --> 15:39.125
["Yum Yum (Gimme Some)"
by The Fatback Band playing]

15:39.208 --> 15:40.125
[pops lips]

15:41.666 --> 15:44.375
It's not just about
you forgetting to thank me, Malcolm.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.625
It's about how you see me.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.916
And how you view my contribution,
not just to this relationship,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.458
but to your work.

15:50.541 --> 15:53.791
Specifically in a movie
you made about my life.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.750
♪ My name is Yum Yum
Gimme some ♪

15:56.833 --> 15:59.041

16:11.208 --> 16:13.208
[crickets chirping]

16:45.666 --> 16:46.666
[sighs]

16:53.208 --> 16:54.125
[blows]

17:00.291 --> 17:01.666
[shouting] You know, Marie…

17:03.375 --> 17:04.958
you are genuinely…

17:05.750 --> 17:06.916
unstable.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.208
[grunts softly]

17:15.541 --> 17:16.750
I'm not kidding!

17:18.958 --> 17:19.833
Hmm.

17:20.958 --> 17:21.791
Mmm.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.916
I'm actually concerned
for your mental well-being!

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
-[fork scraping]
-Hmm. [clears throat]

17:29.375 --> 17:30.208
Hmm.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.375
[chair scraping]

17:33.791 --> 17:35.791
Obviously, there are certain similarities.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.708
But Imani's not based on you.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.083
[spoon tapping on pot]

17:41.666 --> 17:43.416
You're fucking delusional!

17:47.625 --> 17:48.625
[sighs]

17:52.875 --> 17:56.083
In what fucking universe
is Imani's character based on you?

17:56.666 --> 17:57.500
Really?

17:58.250 --> 18:01.500
Are you actually yelling and belittling me
from across this house

18:01.583 --> 18:04.250
because you are too busy
eating mac and cheese?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.000
-What?
-[imitates Malcolm] "What?"

18:06.833 --> 18:08.416
-I'm not.
-Don't fucking lie!

18:08.500 --> 18:10.666
-You literally just got seconds.
-No, I didn't.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.125
Do you know how disturbing it is

18:12.208 --> 18:14.166
that you can compartmentalize
to such a degree

18:14.250 --> 18:16.500
that you can abuse me
while eating mac and cheese?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.625
-Abuse you?
-Mac and cheese I fucking made you.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.375
-Abuse you?
-Verbally abuse me.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.875
Thanks for the clarification.
It's kind of an important one.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.791
But verbally abuse you? Get out of here.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.916
If you're gonna treat me
like an insane person and call me crazy,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.708
the least you could do is do it without
casually eating macaroni and cheese.

18:31.791 --> 18:33.166
How does that work for you?

18:33.250 --> 18:36.041
What does that sound like
in your fucking brain?

18:36.125 --> 18:38.666
"What a cunt! Mmm.
This macaroni and cheese is delicious."

18:38.750 --> 18:40.541
"What a cunt. I wonder if there's more."

18:40.625 --> 18:43.583
"What a cunt. If I could direct
commercials for Kraft, I would."

18:43.666 --> 18:44.708
Say whatever you want.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.958
Get pissed off I didn't thank you, Anthony
said that joke about you being a model,

18:48.041 --> 18:50.791
that Taylor said
whatever the fuck Taylor said--

18:50.875 --> 18:52.833
-It was mean.
-Well, she's an actor.

18:52.916 --> 18:55.500
All night I had to watch you two
smile and take pictures together.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.208
-She's the lead in my film!
-I know. I don't care.

18:58.291 --> 18:59.958
It's my job to make her feel comfortable.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.791
-Not at my expense.
-Actually, it is.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.916
Despite how you fucking
feel about it, it is my job.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
-You'd never forget to thank her.
-Jesus Christ!

19:06.083 --> 19:08.041
-You wouldn't.
-'Cause she's psychotic.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.750
No, because she would flip the fuck out

19:09.833 --> 19:13.875
and spend the night making you pay for it
so you'd never let that shit happen again.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.833
You're saying you're not nuts enough.

19:15.916 --> 19:18.333
No. What I'm saying is
you spend your entire life

19:18.416 --> 19:22.166
catering to the feelings and the whims
of literally everyone but me.

19:22.958 --> 19:26.458
Agents, producers, crew members, actors,

19:26.541 --> 19:29.625
fucking fictional characters
get more respect

19:29.708 --> 19:31.500
and empathy from you than I do.

19:32.875 --> 19:36.333
And… [scoffs] That's what's so odd
about this whole fucking situation,

19:36.416 --> 19:39.166
because I get it.
Taylor is wonderful in the film.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.166
But when you get up there
and you talk about

19:41.250 --> 19:43.625
her ability to breathe life
into the character of Imani

19:43.708 --> 19:49.083
without ever mentioning that if
I didn't live my life, she wouldn't exist,

19:49.166 --> 19:50.541
it's kind of fucking weird.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.083
Imani is not based on you.

19:52.166 --> 19:55.375
She's a 20-year-old drug addict trying
to get clean. Just a fucking coincidence?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.875
Obviously, you getting clean
was a part of the inspiration.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.000
-At 20?
-Yes.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.000
And you provide genuine insight into that.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.375
What that was like.
But Imani is not based on you.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.416
It's an amalgamation
of different things, a bunch of things.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.500
Who?

20:09.708 --> 20:10.541
People!

20:10.625 --> 20:12.083
What people?

20:13.375 --> 20:15.250
A lot of different people.

20:15.958 --> 20:17.208
[Marie] Mmm.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.500
-Like my cousin. Rick, for one.
-Okay.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.041
-A lot of different people and things.
-Your cousin.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.833
-[sighs]
-You know what, Malcolm?

20:29.958 --> 20:33.833
I feel like once you know someone is there
for you and once you know they love you,

20:34.666 --> 20:36.666
you never actually think of them again.

20:37.916 --> 20:39.125
That's not true.

20:39.958 --> 20:42.833
It's not until you're about to lose
someone that you pay attention.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.875
-Is that what this is?
-What?

20:45.958 --> 20:47.791
Is what you're threatening…

20:47.875 --> 20:50.000
if I don't apologize,
I'm going to lose you?

20:50.708 --> 20:52.250
I'm not looking for an apology.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.125
-What do you want? A screenplay credit?
-Don't be cruel.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.625
I'm serious.
I know we talk for hours about work.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.458
Is it so much of a nuisance
that you'd like compensation?

21:00.541 --> 21:03.166
I had a draft of the script
before you ever came into my life.

21:04.041 --> 21:06.291
It's not about credit.
I don't want fucking credit.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.625
Well, what is it, Marie? What do you want?

21:11.291 --> 21:12.625
The film is beautiful.

21:13.958 --> 21:15.041
I'm proud of you.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.083
Took forever to make and it was tough,
but I have one question.

21:18.166 --> 21:22.916
Do you think that the movie would be
as good as it is if we weren't together?

21:28.541 --> 21:29.375
No.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.500
And that's all I wish you would have said.

21:44.041 --> 21:44.875
Great.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.875
Are we no longer fighting?

21:51.625 --> 21:52.625
That depends.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.083
On what?

21:55.166 --> 21:57.375
On whether you can manage
to not say something hurtful

21:57.458 --> 21:58.666
for the rest of the night.

22:02.416 --> 22:03.791
I mean, I'm not that bad.

22:03.875 --> 22:04.916
[inhales sharply]

22:05.000 --> 22:06.875
Fuck you aren't. [sighs]

22:11.791 --> 22:12.791
Can I kiss you?

22:13.583 --> 22:14.583
No.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.125
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

22:22.125 --> 22:23.166
[Malcolm sighs]

22:23.250 --> 22:26.125
But I really, really wanna kiss you.

22:28.375 --> 22:29.541
[softly] I don't care.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.291
Just don't take me for granted.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.333
I don't.

22:52.958 --> 22:53.958
You did.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.541
I'm sorry.

23:05.791 --> 23:06.791
You can kiss me now.

23:07.541 --> 23:09.000
-[softly] Yes!
-[chuckles softly]

23:18.375 --> 23:20.708
I'm the only person who tells you
you're being an asshole

23:20.791 --> 23:22.250
when you're being an asshole.

23:24.416 --> 23:25.416
[Malcolm] I know.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.875
And now…

23:29.875 --> 23:33.541
that you've made a movie
that everybody loves…

23:34.958 --> 23:37.375
-the world's gonna be kissing your ass.
-[chuckles]

23:37.875 --> 23:39.208
-You think so?
-Mm-hmm.

36:22.458 --> 36:23.500
Trust me.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.291
[Malcolm sniffles]

36:29.583 --> 36:30.750
[clattering in kitchen]

36:33.958 --> 36:35.958
[bottle opening]

36:50.125 --> 36:52.458
[gulps, sighs]

36:52.541 --> 36:53.791
-[sniffles]
-[glass clatters]

36:53.875 --> 36:54.875
[sighing]

36:56.958 --> 36:59.416
All right, how about
we cut the bullshit, Malcolm?

37:00.333 --> 37:04.125
Since everybody's being honest tonight,
how about you be honest? Hmm?

37:04.625 --> 37:06.791
About the real reason
you were there for me.

37:11.291 --> 37:13.208
I was good fucking material.

37:15.958 --> 37:18.791
Hmm? That's why you stuck by me.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.375
Because I was a story.

37:21.458 --> 37:25.041
It was a world of emotions you weren't
used to seeing so fucking close.

37:25.125 --> 37:28.541
And because I was 20 years old and I'd
never been loved the way you loved me

37:28.625 --> 37:31.583
or thought you loved me,
I didn't realize what I was to you.

37:32.916 --> 37:35.750
A fucking movie. A tragedy.

37:35.833 --> 37:38.958
One that you could continue watching
for as long as you were there for me.

37:39.041 --> 37:42.250
And tonight, in that fucking audience,
I watched the whole shit play out.

37:42.333 --> 37:45.541
So don't pretend like it was
a selfless fucking act, Malcolm.

37:46.125 --> 37:49.208
It's literally the basis of your art
and it is the reason

37:49.291 --> 37:52.791
why all these people are calling you
brilliant and brave and fearless.

37:56.041 --> 37:56.916
[scoffs]

37:57.583 --> 37:59.166
"So tell us, Malcolm."

38:00.958 --> 38:03.583
"How were you able to breathe life
into the character of Imani?"

38:03.666 --> 38:06.625
"How were you able
to channel the voice of a young woman

38:06.708 --> 38:08.666
so well, so authentically?"

38:09.416 --> 38:10.333
"Hmm."

38:11.125 --> 38:15.500
"Well, Jennifer, that's a good question.
I guess you could say I stole it."

38:15.583 --> 38:17.000
"I ripped it off."

38:17.791 --> 38:20.166
"Not a literal theft, a spiritual one."

38:21.375 --> 38:22.625
You're a fucking fraud.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.208
The reason you didn't thank me tonight
is because you already know that.

38:26.291 --> 38:30.125
[scoffing] You have nothing new to say.

38:30.208 --> 38:33.250
[laughs] All you can do is fuckin' mimic.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.541
Be a fucking parakeet, a goddamn cockatoo.

38:35.625 --> 38:38.333
I mean, God forbid you are ever alone,

38:38.416 --> 38:40.666
and have to dream up
another original idea.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.833
What are you going to write, Malcolm?

38:44.208 --> 38:45.166
Huh?

38:46.791 --> 38:47.625
Yourself?

38:49.458 --> 38:51.000
Give me a fucking break.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.041
You don't have the balls. [slaps leg]

38:54.125 --> 38:57.958
You don't have the gravitas, the fucking
introspection to look at yourself

38:58.041 --> 38:59.958
and your flaws and your shortcomings

39:00.041 --> 39:02.791
and the fact that you may not be
the next Spike Lee or Barry Jenkins

39:02.875 --> 39:05.708
because those motherfuckers
had something new to say.

39:05.791 --> 39:09.291
Something true to themselves
and their fucking experience.

39:10.458 --> 39:13.500
You say the film is about shame and guilt.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.125
-[pouring liquid]
-Correct?

39:15.958 --> 39:17.333
Your words, not mine.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.916
All right. Well, I have
a question for you, Malcolm.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.791
Whose fucking shame?

39:23.458 --> 39:25.166
Whose guilt?

39:25.250 --> 39:28.291
What the fuck do you know
about shame and guilt?

39:28.375 --> 39:31.458
You have two parents, no bad habits
other than being a fucking prick,

39:31.541 --> 39:32.666
and a college education.

39:32.750 --> 39:35.250
Your mother is a therapist.
Your father is a professor.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.000
Your sister works for a think tank in D.C.

39:38.083 --> 39:42.333
But out here, on these streets,
these smiling fucking rich people,

39:42.416 --> 39:44.916
they think you know
what it's like to scrap.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.375
Think you fucking lived it.
Give me a break.

39:50.666 --> 39:53.750
You're more privileged than the white girl
who works for the LA Times,

39:53.833 --> 39:57.083
who thinks she's doing a public service
by lifting up your mediocre ass.

39:57.875 --> 39:58.875
Now you're being cruel.

39:58.958 --> 40:01.750
Try slitting your wrists
with a pair of nail scissors.

40:04.541 --> 40:07.333
You're not gonna wanna survive it,
because it's embarrassing.

40:07.416 --> 40:08.250
Don't worry.

40:08.333 --> 40:11.291
I'm not so petty I throw it out
in argument because I'm angry.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.416
-I didn't mean it.
-Too late.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.958
It's embarrassing and it's cruel,

40:17.041 --> 40:19.416
and it makes me regret
sharing so much with you.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.000
-[softly] Fucking calling me…
-[door shuts]

40:30.541 --> 40:34.833
[mumbling profanity]

40:34.916 --> 40:37.041
-[instrumental music playing]
-[water running]

40:41.791 --> 40:43.291
[foot tapping]

40:55.583 --> 40:59.375
-[crickets chirping]
-[muttering] I'm keeping you…

41:10.958 --> 41:11.791
Bullshit!

41:23.000 --> 41:26.541
How the fuck am I keeping you from a life?

41:26.625 --> 41:27.875
So stupid.

41:31.333 --> 41:32.458
[grunting]

41:37.125 --> 41:38.083
Fucking bullshit.

41:46.208 --> 41:47.958
[mumbling indistinctly]

41:55.166 --> 41:57.916
I know… I know what this is.
This is bullshit.

42:02.416 --> 42:03.583
Fuck Malibu.

42:08.375 --> 42:09.583
[banging]

42:11.000 --> 42:12.500
What do you mean, "mediocre"?

42:13.333 --> 42:14.458
[Marie inhales deeply]

42:15.375 --> 42:16.708
[water gurgling]

42:16.791 --> 42:18.458
[door slides open]

42:20.750 --> 42:22.583
Were you just trying to be mean?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.416
Is that why you said it?

42:32.166 --> 42:33.458
Out of everything I said,

42:34.791 --> 42:36.791
"mediocre" is what stuck with you?

42:37.458 --> 42:39.666
I just wanna know
if you actually believe it.

42:42.750 --> 42:43.583
Guess.

42:44.083 --> 42:47.333
-Answer the question.
-What is the question specifically?

42:47.416 --> 42:49.166
Do you not like the movie?

42:50.125 --> 42:51.166
I never said that.

42:53.791 --> 42:56.208
-So you don't like me and the movie.
-I never said that.

42:56.291 --> 42:58.125
That's literally
what you just fucking said.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.958
I feel like you're being a bit irrational.

43:01.041 --> 43:02.166
I'm being irrational?

43:02.958 --> 43:05.916
I'm being fucking irrational?
This is the biggest night of my life,

43:06.000 --> 43:09.041
and you're trying to turn it
into the worst and I'm being irrational.

43:09.750 --> 43:10.750
Look at you.

43:10.833 --> 43:13.625
You're so solipsistic
that you see yourself in everything.

43:13.708 --> 43:15.708
Even in things you had nothing to do with.

43:15.791 --> 43:17.375
You notice the way Imani walks.

43:17.458 --> 43:20.333
You turn to me and say,
"I wonder where you got that walk from."

43:20.416 --> 43:22.458
I don't say shit.
I actually smile, don't I?

43:22.541 --> 43:25.333
Keep that shit light
because I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

43:25.416 --> 43:27.541
but you tally that shit up, Marie.

43:27.625 --> 43:30.083
While I'm actually
doing something, creating something,

43:30.166 --> 43:33.791
you're on the sidelines trying to justify
your motherfucking existence.

43:34.750 --> 43:39.791
"I know that line." "I said that."
"I did that." "You got that from me."

43:39.875 --> 43:43.250
Shit, even feedback from you
comes with an IOU, Marie.

43:43.333 --> 43:45.500
You wanna play fucking dirty?

43:46.083 --> 43:47.291
Well, let's fucking go.

43:48.833 --> 43:50.208
You wanna hurt me, Marie.

43:51.500 --> 43:54.166
I promise you,
I can hurt you ten times worse.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.791
You're a fucking featherweight,
a level-one boss.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.833
I can snap you like a twig.

44:01.875 --> 44:04.291
Imani is based on you
as much as she is on me.

44:04.375 --> 44:05.625
What she says to the nurse,

44:05.708 --> 44:09.833
that's what I said to the doctor
when my dad was in the ICU.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.375
You noticed the way
Imani walks, didn't you?

44:14.083 --> 44:15.166
It's a good walk.

44:15.916 --> 44:18.208
That was my ex-girlfriend, Jess.

44:19.708 --> 44:21.708
So was the scene
on the bicycle in the rain.

44:21.791 --> 44:23.916
It wasn't based on the trip
you and I took to Barcelona.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.833
That's Jess and I
on the Citi Bike in Brooklyn.

44:28.541 --> 44:31.083
The way she ties her shoes with two loops…

44:32.083 --> 44:33.291
That was Jayla.

44:34.250 --> 44:35.416
You weren't the first.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.041
The joke about
how she doesn't give handjobs.

44:38.125 --> 44:41.666
Well, that's an old played-out line
that every nigga done heard before.

44:42.750 --> 44:46.125
The joke she makes
about how quickly she orgasms.

44:47.583 --> 44:48.583
That was Kiki.

44:49.416 --> 44:50.666
Kiki.

44:51.708 --> 44:53.083
She's a dancer.

44:54.958 --> 44:56.833
Dancer. We'll call her a dancer.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.833
Who I met
outside of St. Louis on a road trip.

45:00.916 --> 45:04.375
I fucked the shit out of her
in the penthouse suite of a Marriott.

45:04.458 --> 45:07.083
Once on the bed, once in the shower.

45:07.166 --> 45:09.916
We might've even fucked
in the closet or some shit too.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.166
I got a Polaroid of her.

45:13.666 --> 45:16.583
Sitting naked in a heart-shaped tub.

45:16.666 --> 45:19.416
It's in a photo album
at home in our closet.

45:22.083 --> 45:23.500
But you're an addict, right?

45:24.500 --> 45:26.500
That's what makes you so unique, right?

45:26.583 --> 45:29.958
That's what makes your contribution
so much more significant, right?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.833
Get the entire fuck out of here.

45:33.916 --> 45:37.500
You're not the first broken girl
I've known, fucked or dated.

45:38.125 --> 45:41.208
I wrote my first script
in a one-bedroom apartment with Leah,

45:41.291 --> 45:43.625
who I thought loved hour-long showers

45:43.708 --> 45:47.291
until I found her passed out
with a fucking needle in her arm.

45:47.958 --> 45:50.708
Two years ago,
I got an email from her sister

45:50.791 --> 45:53.958
saying she took a whole bottle
of Tylenol to the head and passed away

45:54.041 --> 45:55.333
and asked if I had any pictures

45:55.416 --> 45:57.833
'cause she was putting together
a slideshow on her behalf.

45:57.916 --> 46:00.291
Now that I think about it,
I should've thanked her tonight.

46:00.375 --> 46:01.500
She deserves it.

46:08.250 --> 46:09.375
Same with Tasha.

46:10.791 --> 46:13.000
First girl I actually loved,
I truly loved.

46:13.083 --> 46:14.750
The first girl who truly broke my heart.

46:14.833 --> 46:17.208
She never cheated on me.
She's got that going for her.

46:17.291 --> 46:19.708
She found Jesus,
got married, got divorced.

46:19.791 --> 46:23.000
She constantly DMs me
pictures of her daughter

46:23.083 --> 46:25.500
saying she wished she had a child with me.

46:26.291 --> 46:30.333
I send her heart emojis because I honestly
don't know how to respond to that.

46:31.916 --> 46:33.000
Are you done?

46:35.541 --> 46:37.291
Not even fucking close.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.916
Why, would you like me to stop?

46:43.583 --> 46:46.125
[quietly] No, Malcolm. Keep going.

46:46.208 --> 46:47.875
-Why?
-Hmm.

46:49.625 --> 46:50.958
'Cause you like that shit?

46:52.541 --> 46:55.041
You know how disturbed you are, Marie?

46:55.125 --> 46:58.083
You may have gotten clean, but
you still haven't figured this part out.

46:58.166 --> 47:01.916
Why you love being hurt,
traumatized and fucking eviscerated?

47:03.791 --> 47:04.625
It's not normal.

47:04.708 --> 47:08.125
It's not healthy, and it permeates
every aspect of our relationship.

47:08.208 --> 47:12.541
The way we talk,
the way we fight, the way we fuck.

47:12.625 --> 47:15.541
I've dated some
damaged people in my life, Marie.

47:15.625 --> 47:19.500
But none of them wanted to be
debased and degraded like you.

47:20.458 --> 47:22.041
And honestly, Marie…

47:24.125 --> 47:25.833
it's nothing to be proud of.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
So stop fucking smiling,
'cause you look like a clown.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.500
Now there's some material for you.

47:45.166 --> 47:47.166
[footsteps receding]

48:03.875 --> 48:06.750
You know what I just realized, Marie?

48:09.333 --> 48:11.541
It's not about justifying your existence.

48:12.916 --> 48:13.916
It's not.

48:15.208 --> 48:17.458
It's about you
being so scared and so selfish

48:17.541 --> 48:19.333
that you have to break me down.

48:20.875 --> 48:22.708
Second guess everything I do.

48:23.375 --> 48:24.916
"Am I mediocre?"

48:25.625 --> 48:27.541
"Can I do this without her?"

48:27.625 --> 48:31.500
"I don't know. I better ask Marie.
Maybe Marie will know the answer."

48:31.583 --> 48:33.458
"Where's Marie?
I need Marie." That's a cut.

48:33.541 --> 48:34.916
"Marie, where did you go?"

48:35.000 --> 48:36.958
"Did you see that performance?
What'd you think?"

48:37.041 --> 48:38.958
"You liked it? Yeah, me too."

48:39.833 --> 48:44.125
God forbid I'm secure enough
in my opinion that I don't need you.

48:45.541 --> 48:47.333
That's what this all is about.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.166
Your whole speech about fake films.

48:52.125 --> 48:54.625
You just need a reason to be needed

48:54.708 --> 48:59.000
because if I don't need you, then
what the hell am I doing with you, Marie?

49:00.875 --> 49:02.208
You want control

49:02.291 --> 49:06.333
because you can't imagine the reason
I'm with you is because I love you.

49:08.416 --> 49:10.291
I just love you, baby.

49:11.791 --> 49:13.041
I don't need you.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.625
But I love you. That there's somebody
on this planet that just loves you.

49:19.333 --> 49:21.958
I love the way your mind works, Marie.

49:23.208 --> 49:24.083
I do.

49:24.625 --> 49:27.375
I love the way you see the world.

49:28.291 --> 49:30.500
I love the way you think.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.125
Your instincts.

49:32.208 --> 49:36.375
And I'm so fucking grateful

49:36.458 --> 49:39.916
because everything
that you've been through, everything…

49:42.166 --> 49:44.500
That's what made you you.
That's what made you you.

49:44.583 --> 49:46.541
The girl that I love,
the girl that I fuck with,

49:46.625 --> 49:48.958
the girl that I'm up
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning

49:49.041 --> 49:54.125
on the biggest night of my life
because she's relentless. [laughing]

49:57.041 --> 49:58.250
And crazy.

50:00.708 --> 50:03.750
[voice shaking]
And I'm sorry, though. I'm sorry.

50:04.875 --> 50:07.875
I apologized, you know, and…

50:09.375 --> 50:11.750
a thousand times. I know I fucked up.

50:12.625 --> 50:15.916
But honestly, the second we got home,

50:16.500 --> 50:18.916
all I wanted to do
was celebrate with you, baby.

50:19.750 --> 50:22.458
Marie, my girl, the love of my life.

50:26.875 --> 50:30.333
You wanna know the part
of Imani that's based on you?

50:33.833 --> 50:34.833
It's the end.

50:36.250 --> 50:38.833
The part that makes it
such a tragedy. The part…

50:39.791 --> 50:40.916
that she…

50:41.000 --> 50:45.833
Where she loathes herself so much
because of all the guilt and the shame.

50:47.875 --> 50:49.666
That she can't let the good in.

50:52.833 --> 50:54.875
That's the part that's based on you.

50:57.666 --> 50:59.916
Her inability to fathom

51:00.000 --> 51:03.291
that there's someone
on this planet Earth that just loves her.

51:06.541 --> 51:08.625
Despite her not loving herself.

51:13.333 --> 51:14.333
That's you.

51:19.750 --> 51:21.583
That's the part that isn't fiction.

-Fuckin' LA Times review's up.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.791
-[Marie] Oh, shit. What does it say?
-I don't know. Fucking Internet.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.166
-[Marie] Is it good?
-Hold on.

57:03.250 --> 57:05.208
-[Marie] Who sent it to you?
-No one. I found it.

57:05.291 --> 57:08.000
-[Marie] How come no one sent it?
-Marie, stop. It's loading.

57:08.083 --> 57:09.750
[Marie] All right. What's the headline?

57:09.833 --> 57:13.708
Oh, gotta pay a fucking paywall now?
A fucking paywall? Really?

57:13.791 --> 57:14.833
[Marie] When was it posted?

57:14.916 --> 57:18.458
Dollar-ninety-nine a fucking month.
Twenty minutes ago.

57:18.541 --> 57:21.750
And no one sent it to you?
How come no one sent it to you?

57:21.833 --> 57:23.666
Shit. Where's my fucking wallet?

57:23.750 --> 57:25.875

57:25.958 --> 57:27.041
-[Malcolm] No!
-Why?

57:27.125 --> 57:29.958
-Because I don't trust that shit.
-Really?

57:30.041 --> 57:33.083
-Marie, stop.
-I'm sorry. Okay. Okay.

57:34.750 --> 57:36.208
Did what's-her-name write it?

57:36.291 --> 57:37.583
-[Malcolm] The white girl?
-Yeah.

57:37.666 --> 57:40.083
-[Malcolm] Yeah.
-Then it's gotta be positive.

57:40.166 --> 57:43.000
[Malcolm] Shit, I hope so.
Where's my motherfuckin' wallet?

57:43.083 --> 57:44.791
[Marie] Did you check the bedroom?

57:47.625 --> 57:49.083
-[Malcolm] What?
-Check the bedroom?

57:49.166 --> 57:52.708
-Yeah, I checked the fucking bedroom!
-Okay. Well, then did you check the bar?

57:53.208 --> 57:54.041
[Malcolm mumbles]

57:54.125 --> 57:56.958
I checked the fucking bar too, Marie!
Where the fuck is the…

57:57.041 --> 57:59.333
Where the fuck is the…
Oh, I got it. I got it.

57:59.416 --> 58:02.708
-Got it? Where was it?
-Doesn't matter.

58:02.791 --> 58:03.625
[Marie] Mmm.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.000
[Malcolm breathing heavily]

58:08.083 --> 58:11.916
Oh, shit! Where the fuck is my phone?

58:12.000 --> 58:13.333
-Malcolm.
-Where's my phone?

58:13.416 --> 58:14.791
-Malcolm. Malcolm?
-What?

58:14.875 --> 58:16.666
It's right here. It's right here.

58:16.750 --> 58:17.708
Calm down.

58:21.458 --> 58:23.041
"Imani review."

58:23.125 --> 58:24.750
"A cinematic tour de force

58:24.833 --> 58:28.125
takes aim at the twin horrors
of healthcare and racism,

58:28.208 --> 58:32.166
in Malcolm Elliot's rebellious,
jazzy directorial debut."

58:33.083 --> 58:34.833
-I fucking hate this woman.
-[chuckles]

58:34.916 --> 58:36.250
Who wants to see that film?

58:36.333 --> 58:38.125
"Cinematic tour de force" is all I heard.

58:38.208 --> 58:41.166
-You didn't hear "jazzy"?
-No, I heard "jazzy," too.

58:41.250 --> 58:44.333
"Like the opening Steadicam shot."
It's a dolly, you fucking idiot.

58:44.416 --> 58:46.458
"Through the streets of Bed-Stuy,
we know one thing

58:46.541 --> 58:49.458
about our slender protagonist Imani.
She marches to her own beat."

58:49.541 --> 58:51.791
"She sets the tone,
the atmosphere, the vibe."

58:51.875 --> 58:54.875
"She may slink and slide through
halfway houses and in-patient hospitals,

58:54.958 --> 58:57.333
but make no mistake,
as the title suggests,

58:57.416 --> 59:00.833
this is her film, her world, her turf.
Until it's not."

59:00.916 --> 59:03.208
"If you can't tell
by the rhythm of my white girl words,

59:03.291 --> 59:04.750
you are in for a Black film."

59:04.833 --> 59:07.458
[chuckling] The synopsis.
Boring, boring, boring.

59:07.541 --> 59:11.500
The only reason you know it's 2-perf 35 is
because I said it at the premier, dipshit.

59:11.583 --> 59:12.666
"Positive…"

59:12.750 --> 59:14.708
"Leading to a harrowing
and indelible scene

59:14.791 --> 59:17.083
where Imani overdoses
at a Chinatown market,

59:17.166 --> 59:19.458
and that's where Elliot's
true target becomes clear."

59:19.541 --> 59:22.833
"This is a film about how the American
healthcare system treats women of color."

59:22.916 --> 59:24.208
And at this precise moment,

59:24.291 --> 59:26.791
every Negro who subscribes
to the LA Times just said,

59:26.875 --> 59:28.750
"Then why the fuck
do I need to see this film?"

59:28.833 --> 59:31.333
Just 'cause the film doesn't star
anybody that looks like her

59:31.416 --> 59:32.833
doesn't mean it's political.

59:32.916 --> 59:36.333
-What's wrong with being political?
-Political films are exhausting.

59:36.416 --> 59:37.958
[Marie] You love political films.

59:38.041 --> 59:40.958
Not the ones the white woman
from the LA Times calls political.

59:41.041 --> 59:42.583
I'm sure she loves Do The Right Thing.

59:42.666 --> 59:46.416
Made at a time when politics weren't cool.
That's what made it so revolutionary.

59:46.500 --> 59:48.541
"When Imani is placed under 5150,

59:48.625 --> 59:50.541
a term for people
being held against their will

59:50.625 --> 59:52.416
and being a danger
to themselves and others,

59:52.500 --> 59:55.875
after a harrowing scene
with a pair of nail scissors, she…"

59:55.958 --> 59:58.916
"She's placed
under the care of friendly doctor

59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.458
played by… TV show fame…"

1:00:02.541 --> 1:00:05.125
"But Elliot knows
the waters he's wading into,

1:00:05.208 --> 1:00:09.291
and carefully, brilliantly subverts
the white savior trope."

1:00:09.375 --> 1:00:11.625
Oh, she's on one now. This fucking stupid…

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:14.666
"Later, when Imani finds herself, uh…

1:00:14.750 --> 1:00:17.750
at her ex-boyfriend's house
begging for a fix,

1:00:17.833 --> 1:00:21.083
Elliot uses tight lenses."
It's the fucking same lens.

1:00:21.166 --> 1:00:22.833
"Claustrophobia…"

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:25.125
"One begins to question his intentions

1:00:25.208 --> 1:00:28.375
in reveling in the trauma
of his Black female heroine for so long."

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:30.208
"It's a scene
better implied than depicted."

1:00:30.291 --> 1:00:32.416
"If not for the restraint
of his own picture,

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.833
then merely to separate itself
from an exhaustive history

1:00:34.916 --> 1:00:37.583
that depicts gendered violence
against women of fucking color."

1:00:37.666 --> 1:00:40.583
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me, ma'am?

1:00:40.666 --> 1:00:44.125
Are you fucking-- In the next line!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1:00:44.208 --> 1:00:47.041
She says it's a "genuine masterwork."
A genuine fucking--

1:00:47.125 --> 1:00:50.416
I can't read this fucking shit anymore.
It's too fucking moronic.

1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:54.416
The fact that the LA Times will
hire such a fucking halfwit is beyond me.

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:57.791
First she says that I brilliantly
subvert the white savior trope.

1:00:57.875 --> 1:00:59.000
She is a savior.

1:00:59.083 --> 1:01:00.791
She's trying to save her,

1:01:00.875 --> 1:01:03.333
so how the fuck
did I subvert it, lady? How?

1:01:03.416 --> 1:01:05.416
You wanna know how?
It's because I'm Black!

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:08.041
If I was white,
she would've said I fell for the trope.

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:10.708
But because I'm a man,
she can question my intention

1:01:10.791 --> 1:01:13.250
saying that I'm reveling
in the trauma of a woman.

1:01:13.333 --> 1:01:14.625
"Better implied than depicted."

1:01:14.708 --> 1:01:17.791
The fuck out of here! Why?
Because Taylor took her shirt off?

1:01:17.875 --> 1:01:21.083
I'm sure she just doesn't think
that the nudity was necessary.

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:22.625
None of it is necessary, Marie.

1:01:22.708 --> 1:01:24.416
None of this shit is necessary.

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:28.833
Movement, blocking, lighting,
fucking digital versus film.

1:01:28.916 --> 1:01:31.625
This cut here, that cut here.
Let's pan. Two-shot.

1:01:31.708 --> 1:01:33.916
None of this shit matters.
It's all about what you want.

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.833
But my fucking problem with her
before she even wrote this dumb-ass,

1:01:36.916 --> 1:01:40.000
bitch-ass, pussy-ass review is
the same after readin' this cock-sucking,

1:01:40.083 --> 1:01:42.041
-motherfucking, dog-dick review.
-[giggles]

1:01:42.125 --> 1:01:45.083
She's not looking at the film.
The ideas in it,

1:01:45.166 --> 1:01:46.875
the emotions, or the craft.

1:01:46.958 --> 1:01:49.375
Cinema doesn't need
to have a fucking message.

1:01:49.458 --> 1:01:51.833
It needs to have a heart and electricity.

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:54.791
Morons like this
sap the world of its mystery

1:01:54.875 --> 1:01:58.000
because they need everything
spelled out with fucking A-B-C blocks.

1:01:58.083 --> 1:02:01.500
And they're terrified to embrace
anything potentially dangerous

1:02:01.583 --> 1:02:03.750
because they're trying
to predict the culture.

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:07.750
This fucking bobblehead shouldn't be
writing for the LA fucking Times.

1:02:07.833 --> 1:02:11.000
She should be holding
smiling sun placards for the local news

1:02:11.083 --> 1:02:13.958
because all she is,
is a motherfucking weatherman!

1:02:16.125 --> 1:02:17.583
Or weatherwoman.

1:02:18.916 --> 1:02:20.041
Whatever.

1:02:21.333 --> 1:02:24.250
Fucking… Dorothy-ass…

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.166
Malcolm.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.000
What?

1:02:32.083 --> 1:02:34.791
She did call it a genuine masterwork.

1:02:37.666 --> 1:02:38.958
I don't give a fuck!

1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:41.625
Unlike her, at least I'm consistent.

1:02:42.166 --> 1:02:43.916
You can't hang everything on identity.

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.333
You can't say that I brilliantly
subverted this trope 'cause I'm Black,

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:50.000
but I fell into this one
because I'm a fucking man!

1:02:50.083 --> 1:02:51.750
Identities are constantly shifting.

1:02:51.833 --> 1:02:54.958
Does the male gaze exist
if the filmmaker's gay and not straight?

1:02:55.041 --> 1:02:57.208
And to what degree?
What if they're asexual?

1:02:57.291 --> 1:02:59.666
What if they're transitioning
and you don't even know it?

1:02:59.750 --> 1:03:03.125
You can only look back at things
and wonder what the fuck it all means!

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:07.750
I mean, why did Ben Hecht and Selznick,
two fucking Jewish men,

1:03:07.833 --> 1:03:10.916
spend so much time on Gone With the Wind?

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.125
To this day,

1:03:12.208 --> 1:03:16.083
no one can explain to me why the fuck
Billy Wilder made Spirit of St. Louis

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:19.208
and lionized
that Nazi bastard Lindbergh, huh?

1:03:19.291 --> 1:03:22.708
Or why Ida Lupino loved film noir
and fucking violent men.

1:03:22.791 --> 1:03:24.833
Why Ed Wood wore fucking panties?

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:29.208
He wore panties and made B films
about fucking space aliens.

1:03:29.291 --> 1:03:32.458
Or Elaine May was fascinated
with emotionally stunted men.

1:03:32.541 --> 1:03:34.541
I mean, did she see herself in them?

1:03:35.208 --> 1:03:38.625
Did she hate them in real life, but wanted
to get to know them through the work?

1:03:38.708 --> 1:03:42.875
The fact that Barry Jenkins isn't gay,
is that what made Moonlight so universal?

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:46.041
Or was being gay the reason Cukor
empathized with women more than men?

1:03:46.125 --> 1:03:47.750
It's all a mystery is the point!

1:03:47.833 --> 1:03:50.625
What drives a filmmaker?
What drives an artist?

1:03:50.708 --> 1:03:52.458
[breathing heavily]

1:03:52.541 --> 1:03:56.625
I mean, why did Pontecorvo,
a fucking rich Italian Jewish man…

1:03:56.708 --> 1:04:00.708
Why did he fucking feel such a kinship
to Algerian Muslim guerrilla fighters

1:04:00.791 --> 1:04:02.916
that he fucking made Battle of Algiers?

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.416
A fucking classic! Tell me that!

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.625
Can you tell me that? Fucking Karen!

1:04:07.708 --> 1:04:11.666
Can you tell me that? You can't, can you?
Because why? 'Cause nobody knows!

1:04:11.750 --> 1:04:15.750
Who the fuck knows? Who the fuck knows?
Why did I shoot the scene the way I did?

1:04:15.833 --> 1:04:17.791
Is it because I'm a man,
because I'm straight?

1:04:17.875 --> 1:04:19.708
Is it because I'm desensitized to violence

1:04:19.791 --> 1:04:23.000
or is it because I believe that
if you witness trauma onscreen,

1:04:23.083 --> 1:04:25.750
the audience should also
feel that fucking trauma?

1:04:25.833 --> 1:04:27.833
That is the mystery of art. Of film.

1:04:27.916 --> 1:04:31.125
What drives someone to make something
and fucking say something.

1:04:31.208 --> 1:04:34.750
Now, you can criticize this system,
which, like every fucking system,

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:36.041
is white as fuck,

1:04:36.125 --> 1:04:38.750
and in our business,
fucking male and white as fuck!

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:40.500
I mean, goddamn!

1:04:40.583 --> 1:04:42.583
I've been waiting my whole life,
I've been askin',

1:04:42.666 --> 1:04:44.375
"Where the fuck
are all the Black filmmakers,

1:04:44.458 --> 1:04:46.916
'cause I'm gettin' sick and tired
of these little British boys

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:50.750
runnin' around here all in they feelings
trying to overcome a fucking birth defect

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:52.875
to save the fucking Queen from Hitler."

1:04:52.958 --> 1:04:55.416
-[chuckling]
-Just do me a fucking favor, all right?

1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:58.666
Ban every fucking film
with a postscript, and we'll be good.

1:04:59.583 --> 1:05:02.125
We'll be fucking great!

1:05:02.208 --> 1:05:06.625
But to write shit like this?
To write this bullshit?

1:05:06.708 --> 1:05:09.708
To box people in
because you don't have the love of film,

1:05:09.791 --> 1:05:12.916
because you don't have the mind
to critique the form, medium, technique.

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.291
You don't have the words
to describe the emotions

1:05:15.375 --> 1:05:17.708
or too much fear
that you're not gonna get clicks,

1:05:17.791 --> 1:05:20.291
or too much fear
that the mob's gonna turn on you.

1:05:20.375 --> 1:05:23.416
Fuck you for inhibiting
the ability for artists to dream about

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.666
what life may be like
for other fucking people.

1:05:25.750 --> 1:05:28.541
Fuck you! Twice! With a sick cactus dick!

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:31.791
Even if you come up short,
even if you could do better, fuck you!

1:05:31.875 --> 1:05:33.666
You're the reason they make this stale,

1:05:33.750 --> 1:05:35.833
safe, stagnant turgid shit
in the first place!

1:05:35.916 --> 1:05:38.375
You're the reason! Not me!
You're the reason!

1:05:39.875 --> 1:05:43.666
I mean, you should be fucking bold!
You should be fucking reckless!

1:05:43.750 --> 1:05:45.958
People should be fucking reckless!

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:48.208
They should be yelling
at the top of their lungs!

1:05:48.291 --> 1:05:52.375
Hey, Karen! Hey, Al!

1:05:52.458 --> 1:05:55.666
I hear you, and I don't give a fuck!

1:05:56.291 --> 1:05:58.166
Because they're not gonna get any better

1:05:58.250 --> 1:06:02.083
until they start rebelling against this
purist, moralistic, academic nonsense

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.916
in the same way Spike Lee
rebelled against the white system

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.541
when he made Do the Right Thing.

1:06:06.625 --> 1:06:08.833
Normally, I wish death
upon someone like this.

1:06:08.916 --> 1:06:11.541
Someone who lacks
the fucking imagination like this.

1:06:11.625 --> 1:06:14.416
But instead, I'm gonna pray fucking hard,

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:17.625
the way my mama taught me,
that she gets fucking carpal tunnel,

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:19.541
until her hands atrophy and cramp

1:06:19.625 --> 1:06:24.833
and she can no longer write nonsensical
fucking garbage like this anymore!

1:06:24.916 --> 1:06:26.333
[panting]

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:27.833
-[grunts]
-[Marie] Mmm.

1:06:27.916 --> 1:06:29.291
[laughing]

1:06:31.375 --> 1:06:33.083
Oh, my God.

1:06:36.625 --> 1:06:39.666
So this is what happens
when you get a good review?

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:45.708
-You're fucking crazy.
-[both chuckle]

1:06:45.791 --> 1:06:47.666
I'm ser-- You're delirious.

1:06:47.750 --> 1:06:49.250
-[Malcolm grunts]
-[chuckles]

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:53.125
Honestly, Malcolm,
you are a true insane person.

1:06:54.333 --> 1:06:56.916
I know. I know. I just…
I'm tired of fighting, Marie.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.625
That was a fight
you had entirely with yourself.

1:06:59.708 --> 1:07:01.458
[both chuckling]

1:07:02.833 --> 1:07:04.500
You think you're the first writer

1:07:04.583 --> 1:07:07.666
in the history of writing
to have this issue with critics?

1:07:07.750 --> 1:07:08.666
'Course not.

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:11.458
Of course not,
'cause it's all the same bullshit.

1:07:11.541 --> 1:07:14.291
So, what, Malcolm? You wanna make movies,

1:07:14.375 --> 1:07:17.333
and no one's allowed to say
anything bad about them?

1:07:17.416 --> 1:07:20.083
Give me a break.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:22.583
[mockingly] "Oh, no!
Someone attacked my movie."

1:07:22.666 --> 1:07:24.750
Well, fuck these lazy-ass critics.

1:07:24.833 --> 1:07:30.000
Malcolm, you are not making pottery
for a living, okay?

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:34.708
You are a filmmaker,
and filmmaking is the most capitalistic,

1:07:34.791 --> 1:07:37.708
mainstream fucking art form
on the planet Earth.

1:07:37.791 --> 1:07:40.083
No matter how many times
Taylor told E! News

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:41.916
that she was a fucking communist.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000
-She what?
-Or a Maoist.

1:07:44.083 --> 1:07:45.708
-Come on.
-It was something like that.

1:07:45.791 --> 1:07:48.208
She might've talked about
the redistribution of wealth,

1:07:48.291 --> 1:07:49.333
lack of social programs.

1:07:49.416 --> 1:07:51.916
-While selling a film?
-The mental healthcare industry--

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.583
-For $15 a ticket?
-I'm just saying--

1:07:53.666 --> 1:07:54.791
On E! News.

1:07:55.458 --> 1:07:56.875
It was Entertainment Tonight.

1:07:58.250 --> 1:08:00.416
And you wonder
why the white girl's talking about

1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:02.458
the mental healthcare system
in her review.

1:08:03.958 --> 1:08:04.875
Because…

1:08:04.958 --> 1:08:06.541
-[Marie] Mm-hmm.
-[mumbling]

1:08:06.625 --> 1:08:09.416
Oh, she… Oh, shit, you're right.

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:10.333
Right?

1:08:10.875 --> 1:08:12.625
Oh. [chuckles]

1:08:12.708 --> 1:08:14.458
-Yep. [chuckles]
-[stomping feet]

1:08:14.541 --> 1:08:16.625
I hate to break it to you, but uh…

1:08:17.583 --> 1:08:19.708
no one in this game is a radical.

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:23.333
-Oh, Taylor's pretty radical.
-Bullshit. She likes to play one on TV.

1:08:23.416 --> 1:08:24.416
What do you mean?

1:08:25.750 --> 1:08:27.541
All of y'all are
a bunch of hookers and hoes.

1:08:27.625 --> 1:08:30.083
-You calling me a ho?
-Yes, I am calling you a ho.

1:08:30.166 --> 1:08:31.916
-[chuckles]
-[laughing] Fuck you.

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.583
'Cause you're a ho!
What? You are. That's fine.

1:08:35.375 --> 1:08:37.416
That's why you're hell-bent
on sounding smart,

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:40.000
'cause you're compensating
for the fact that you're a ho.

1:08:40.083 --> 1:08:42.625
Instead of just understanding that…

1:08:42.708 --> 1:08:45.583
this is just how
the world of ho-dom turns.

1:08:45.666 --> 1:08:49.250
You know, you got an actress
in a $2,000 dress,

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:51.083
talkin' about socialism on a red carpet

1:08:51.166 --> 1:08:53.625
because she's too afraid
to admit that, guess what,

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:55.708
she's just… she's just a fuckin' actor.

1:08:56.375 --> 1:08:57.750
There's no shame in that.

1:08:58.333 --> 1:09:00.875
And then you got
every entertainment outlet

1:09:00.958 --> 1:09:04.625
running with her call to arms,
her viva la revolution.

1:09:04.708 --> 1:09:07.708
Not because they actually care
or want to spread the message.

1:09:07.791 --> 1:09:12.250
But because they know that there's
nothing that sells more than disgust.

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000
-Hmm.
-That's what gets the clicks.

1:09:16.083 --> 1:09:19.041
And you dumbasses
fall for that shit every time.

1:09:20.208 --> 1:09:22.666
Honestly, nobody cares
what you have to say.

1:09:23.625 --> 1:09:24.625
They don't.

1:09:25.208 --> 1:09:27.166
You guys play fucking dress-up
for a living.

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:28.125
[Malcolm scoffs]

1:09:28.708 --> 1:09:33.916
This is some only-in-America, ho-ass shit.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.333
[laughing]

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:37.875
And all of you are guilty.

1:09:38.833 --> 1:09:42.791
You know? So just stay in your lane.
Keep doing your ho shit. It's fine.

1:09:43.958 --> 1:09:45.125
[Malcolm mumbles]

1:09:45.208 --> 1:09:48.416
Malcolm, you got
a great review with an asterisk.

1:09:50.416 --> 1:09:53.041
Boo-fucking-hoo.

1:09:57.500 --> 1:09:58.708
I'm a ho, huh?

1:09:58.791 --> 1:10:01.125
Mm-hmm. Most definitely.

1:10:03.416 --> 1:10:06.333
-I love you.
-Don't manipulate me.

1:10:06.416 --> 1:10:07.500
[kissing]

1:10:07.583 --> 1:10:09.583
[slow jazz music playing]

1:10:47.958 --> 1:10:49.250
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:51.583
-Okay. I got a gameplan.
-Okay.

1:10:52.333 --> 1:10:54.333
-I love what's happening.
-[chuckles]

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:57.250
Oh, my God. And thank God. I just…

1:10:57.333 --> 1:10:59.333
-Been wanting to do this all night.
-[giggles]

1:10:59.416 --> 1:11:00.416
Here's the gameplan.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.250
I'm gonna go from here…

1:11:03.375 --> 1:11:04.458
to the bathroom.

1:11:05.291 --> 1:11:06.833
-Because I have to pee.
-Okay.

1:11:06.916 --> 1:11:08.333
-Okay. Is it okay?
-That's fine.

1:11:08.416 --> 1:11:12.083
And let's just keep it positive.
Happy thoughts.

1:11:12.791 --> 1:11:14.958
You stay right here.
Don't move. You look beautiful.

1:11:15.041 --> 1:11:16.791
-Stay right here. Okay?
-Okay.

1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:19.083
-You stay right here.
-Okay.

1:11:21.875 --> 1:11:22.833
Hey.

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:26.375
-Oh, my God. Oh, my…
-[chuckles]

1:11:26.458 --> 1:11:28.458
[footsteps receding]

1:11:51.791 --> 1:11:53.500
[urinating]

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:56.500
[toilet flushes]

1:11:58.583 --> 1:12:00.416
-[faucet squeaks]
-[water running]

1:12:17.833 --> 1:12:18.833
[Marie] Malcolm?

1:12:23.458 --> 1:12:24.291
Yeah?

1:12:27.958 --> 1:12:30.291
Can I ask you a question
and you promise to answer

1:12:30.375 --> 1:12:32.125
without making me feel like shit?

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:35.500
[sighs deeply]

1:12:35.583 --> 1:12:36.500
Yeah.

1:12:45.208 --> 1:12:46.708
Why didn't you cast me?

1:12:57.500 --> 1:12:59.791
When you first wrote it,
you wrote it for me.

1:13:02.916 --> 1:13:04.666
So why didn't you cast me?

1:13:05.583 --> 1:13:06.708
[clicks tongue]

1:13:11.666 --> 1:13:14.208
So that's what this whole thing
has been about tonight?

1:13:15.916 --> 1:13:16.791
[softly] No.

1:13:16.875 --> 1:13:18.500
-Bullshit, Marie.
-It's not.

1:13:18.583 --> 1:13:21.458
-You're lying. Yes, it is.
-[voice shaking] I'm not lying.

1:13:24.041 --> 1:13:27.875
At some point, Malcolm, this was
something that we were gonna do together.

1:13:30.041 --> 1:13:32.083
And I don't know when that changed.

1:13:33.541 --> 1:13:37.375
I don't know when, I don't know how,
I just know that I was in that audience…

1:13:38.791 --> 1:13:40.625
and I thought to myself, "Wow."

1:13:44.083 --> 1:13:46.583
"I did not mean to give all that away."

1:13:46.666 --> 1:13:48.125
[breath trembling]

1:13:50.125 --> 1:13:53.250
And I don't wanna get
into all the reasons why you cast Taylor,

1:13:54.833 --> 1:13:56.833
but you're so good at fighting.

1:13:57.666 --> 1:14:00.041
You're so good at fighting.
You fought to make the movie,

1:14:00.125 --> 1:14:03.750
to make it the way you wanted to make it.
So why didn't you fight for me?

1:14:08.750 --> 1:14:11.208
Because I would have been good. [sniffles]

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:14.166
I would have.

1:14:16.125 --> 1:14:17.500
Maybe even better.

1:14:20.166 --> 1:14:21.166
So there it is.

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:25.083
-What?
-The fucking truth.

1:14:25.166 --> 1:14:28.583
Leave it to you to spend the entire night
burning it all to the ground

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:32.708
only to reveal that in the end,
you're just jealous.

1:14:32.791 --> 1:14:34.291
-I'm not jealous.
-Yes, you are.

1:14:34.375 --> 1:14:36.208
-I'm not jealous.
-Of course you are.

1:14:36.291 --> 1:14:39.250
The feeling that I'm feeling right now
is deeper than that.

1:14:40.541 --> 1:14:42.333
It's not jealousy. [crying]

1:14:42.416 --> 1:14:44.250
Oh, come on. Give me a break, Marie.

1:14:44.333 --> 1:14:46.750
It's the fact that
I can't tell my story anymore.

1:14:47.833 --> 1:14:52.958
I can't articulate all the fucking chaos
that's going on in here

1:14:53.041 --> 1:14:54.250
because you already did.

1:14:54.333 --> 1:14:55.458
[sniffles]

1:14:55.541 --> 1:14:57.583
You already did and Taylor already did.

1:14:58.833 --> 1:15:00.875
I know it's not solely mine.

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:02.708
I know that.

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:05.875
I know it happened to both of us.

1:15:05.958 --> 1:15:09.083
But the difference is you were able
to take all the ugly shit

1:15:09.166 --> 1:15:10.791
and make it something beautiful.

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:14.833
Something good.

1:15:15.708 --> 1:15:16.916
Something that…

1:15:18.541 --> 1:15:20.250
that could move people.

1:15:21.916 --> 1:15:23.875
But, Malcolm, I'm stuck with it.

1:15:33.083 --> 1:15:34.125
Yeah.

1:15:34.208 --> 1:15:37.041
I just wish it was something
we could have done together.

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:39.916
And to be brutally honest, yes…

1:15:41.375 --> 1:15:42.833
I would have been better.

1:15:44.666 --> 1:15:46.166
Because I experienced it.

1:15:47.541 --> 1:15:48.625
I lived it.

1:15:52.541 --> 1:15:56.000
Not only would I have been better,
I would have made your film better.

1:15:58.250 --> 1:15:59.541
You gave up acting.

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:02.291
When I got the film financed,
I asked you to audition.

1:16:02.375 --> 1:16:06.416
You said yes, but you were reluctant.
You have talent, but that's not enough.

1:16:07.250 --> 1:16:09.416
It's not enough.
You have to want it, Marie.

1:16:10.125 --> 1:16:13.333
-Trust me, Malcolm, I wanted this one.
-That's fuckin' bullshit.

1:16:13.416 --> 1:16:16.375
You didn't try, and that's
the harsh reality of all of this.

1:16:16.458 --> 1:16:18.833
That same instinct
that exists in Imani, in you,

1:16:18.916 --> 1:16:22.291
that instinct to fucking self-sabotage,

1:16:22.375 --> 1:16:23.500
that didn't go away.

1:16:24.041 --> 1:16:27.916
-I didn't try because you didn't want me.
-Now you wanna play the victim.

1:16:30.458 --> 1:16:33.916
Now you wanna say you felt like
I didn't want you so you didn't try.

1:16:41.333 --> 1:16:43.041
You are fucking intolerable.

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.500
[sighs deeply]

1:17:08.083 --> 1:17:12.000
[Marie] Fucking… You fake-ass,
fraudulent, thievin' fuckin' con man!

1:17:12.083 --> 1:17:15.708
You didn't want me because if you did,
you would have to share the stage.

1:17:15.791 --> 1:17:18.250
You wouldn't be
the sole author of this film.

1:17:18.333 --> 1:17:21.833
It would have a lineage that extended
beyond you and your brilliance,

1:17:21.916 --> 1:17:26.166
because people would ask me and I'd say,
"Yes, this shit happened to me."

1:17:26.250 --> 1:17:29.875
Then all of a sudden everyone would go,
"Is it him or her that's talented?"

1:17:29.958 --> 1:17:33.041
If that's what you have
to tell yourself, then be my guest.

1:17:33.125 --> 1:17:34.375
It's about ownership.

1:17:34.458 --> 1:17:36.291
It's about the illusion you wanna create

1:17:36.375 --> 1:17:38.333
that filmmaking
isn't a collaborative effort.

1:17:38.416 --> 1:17:41.000
It's you, and everybody else
is just following directions.

1:17:41.083 --> 1:17:43.166
-Because if it were me…
-[grunts loudly]

1:17:43.250 --> 1:17:46.541
If it were authentic 'cause of me,
you couldn't swing your dick around!

1:17:46.625 --> 1:17:48.375
That's why you didn't thank me tonight.

1:17:48.458 --> 1:17:51.000
-That's also why you didn't cast me.
-Authenticity.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:53.166
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Ain't that the word of the day?

1:17:53.250 --> 1:17:56.208
It's all I heard tonight.
"He's such an authentic filmmaker."

1:17:56.291 --> 1:17:59.125
"The movie is authentic."
"He channeled his voice authentically."

1:17:59.208 --> 1:18:00.833
-Know why people love that word?
-Why?

1:18:00.916 --> 1:18:02.625
They don't know what makes something good.

1:18:02.708 --> 1:18:03.916
I think authenticity is key.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.208
Of course,
because that's all you have to offer.

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:08.833
-Anyone, all they have to say.
-It's all I have to offer.

1:18:08.916 --> 1:18:11.416
The only word that people
that don't know shit about film

1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:13.208
feels like they got something to offer…

1:18:13.291 --> 1:18:14.833
No, I have nothing to offer.

1:18:14.916 --> 1:18:18.458
They can't say anything about film,
but they love to talk about authenticity.

1:18:18.541 --> 1:18:19.875
They don't know dick about film.

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:22.541
About fucking Citizen Kane
or Best Years of Our Lives--

1:18:22.625 --> 1:18:24.625
No one fucking cares about that shit!

1:18:24.708 --> 1:18:28.041
Authenticity. Oh, shit!
They know that shit through and through.

1:18:28.125 --> 1:18:30.875
Authenticity does not matter,
your perspective doesn't--

1:18:30.958 --> 1:18:32.416
You don't fucking have any!

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.833
Recreating reality
doesn't make something interesting.

1:18:34.916 --> 1:18:37.458
It's about your interpretation
about reality.

1:18:37.541 --> 1:18:39.833
-What you feel about reality.
-You're full of shit.

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:41.250
What you reveal about reality.

1:18:41.333 --> 1:18:43.166
Perspective, your perspective.

1:18:43.250 --> 1:18:46.541
Transcribing a conversation or holding
a camera up and pressing record,

1:18:46.625 --> 1:18:48.541
that's a fucking YouTube video.

1:18:48.625 --> 1:18:50.333
-That's a confession or memoir.
-Okay.

1:18:50.416 --> 1:18:52.500
-We've seen and heard it a thousand times.
-All right.

1:18:52.583 --> 1:18:56.125
Your experience, your life,
your fucking struggle, doesn't matter.

1:18:56.208 --> 1:18:59.791
You've been an addict, boring!
You overdosing, not fucking interesting.

1:18:59.875 --> 1:19:01.875
It's about transferring your emotions

1:19:01.958 --> 1:19:04.583
and all those moments
into something cinematic and moving.

1:19:04.666 --> 1:19:06.416
So, you know what? Good luck, Marie.

1:19:07.958 --> 1:19:09.458
-I hate you!
-I hate you hate too!

1:19:09.541 --> 1:19:11.416
-I hate you more!
-I hate you the most!

1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:13.083
I fucking hate you!

is what authenticity buys you.

Well, damn!
Why didn't you do that in the audition?

I've ever met in my entire life.

1:23:15.125 --> 1:23:17.208
I go from wanting
to cut your head off one moment

1:23:17.291 --> 1:23:20.208
to wanting to kiss your beautiful,
stupid little face the next.

I fucking love you.

-[laughing] Fuckin' psychopath!
-[giggles]

1:23:41.958 --> 1:23:44.958
All this madness was about you,
and that scene,

1:23:45.041 --> 1:23:47.166
sayin' to me
that you could do it better than Taylor

1:23:47.250 --> 1:23:49.833
and seed doubt in my mind that,
for the rest of my life,

1:23:49.916 --> 1:23:51.458
-the movie could've been better.
-Mm-mm.

1:23:51.541 --> 1:23:53.541
-Yes. That's exactly what you doin'.
-Mm-mmm. No.

1:23:53.625 --> 1:23:55.083
-[Malcolm] That's bullshit.
-It's not!

1:23:58.666 --> 1:23:59.791
[both moaning]

1:24:12.083 --> 1:24:15.041
You know what's interesting
about the white girl from LA Times

1:24:15.125 --> 1:24:16.916
calling out that scene in her review?

1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:18.708
Marie, who cares?

1:24:18.791 --> 1:24:22.500
I mean, I've always said,
it was my least favorite in the film.

1:24:23.416 --> 1:24:24.958
But my favorite in the script.

1:24:25.666 --> 1:24:27.916
Can we talk about this later, please?

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.666
-I think it's important, you know?
-I beg you.

1:24:31.666 --> 1:24:33.500
To look back and wonder why that is.

1:24:36.125 --> 1:24:37.958
-Don't you?
-No.

1:24:38.041 --> 1:24:42.333
Not to strip you of your mystery,
you know, just out of curiosity.

1:24:43.291 --> 1:24:46.708
Out of pursuit of wanting to be,
I don't know, a better fucking artist.

1:24:46.791 --> 1:24:50.000
Oh. You are exhausting.

1:24:51.083 --> 1:24:54.000
You gonna be this exhausting at 70
or will you have exhausted yourself?

1:24:54.083 --> 1:24:55.541
That depends where you are.

1:24:55.625 --> 1:24:57.833
Living with the white girl
from the LA Times

1:24:57.916 --> 1:25:00.583
because at least I can
win an argument against her.

1:25:00.666 --> 1:25:05.166
But, you know. It just made me wonder,
why did I see that scene so differently?

1:25:05.250 --> 1:25:08.166
I don't know. How did you see the scene?

1:25:08.250 --> 1:25:09.458
It was less graphic.

1:25:09.541 --> 1:25:12.416
So what? He doesn't attack Imani?
That's what it was on the page.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:16.375
No, he attacks her. I just never thought
that you'd shoot it with her top off.

1:25:16.916 --> 1:25:18.750
-What's the difference?
-Her tits were out.

1:25:18.833 --> 1:25:21.208
-So?
-So, I just feel like you sexualized her.

1:25:21.291 --> 1:25:23.916
If I rolled a camera on you
right now, am I sexualizing you,

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.166
or is this what you have on,
on a Friday night?

1:25:26.250 --> 1:25:27.291
My tits aren't out.

1:25:27.375 --> 1:25:30.083
If you were in a Chuck E. Cheese,
they'd throw your ass out.

1:25:30.166 --> 1:25:32.583
-It was Taylor's idea anyway.
-I'm sure it was.

1:25:33.083 --> 1:25:36.166
Look, it just made
everything more graphic.

1:25:36.666 --> 1:25:38.875
Okay? And I just thought…

1:25:40.083 --> 1:25:42.875
would the scene have been
a bit different if you were a woman?

1:25:43.833 --> 1:25:46.916
Yes, but I also would have shot
the entire movie differently

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.458
because I wouldn't have been me,
I would've been a woman.

1:25:49.541 --> 1:25:51.500
I would've had
a totally different sensibility.

1:25:51.583 --> 1:25:53.583
But that's not how
you judge film intelligently,

1:25:53.666 --> 1:25:57.916
by the 600 trillion different choices
not made due to an intangible

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.416
yet purely hypothetical
assessment of one's identity.

1:26:00.500 --> 1:26:02.791
But rather the choices
actually being fucking made.

1:26:02.875 --> 1:26:05.583
[sighs] Look, I'm not defending her
as a great fuckin' thinker.

1:26:05.666 --> 1:26:07.333
Good. 'Cause she's an idiot.

1:26:07.416 --> 1:26:10.291
I'm just saying… would the movie
have been a little better

1:26:10.375 --> 1:26:12.000
if you had a dash of femininity?

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:13.666
-Who gives a fuck?
-I do.

1:26:13.791 --> 1:26:15.750
-Fuck.
-I do. I do.

1:26:15.833 --> 1:26:18.208
I do, Malcolm,
because it just made me wonder

1:26:18.291 --> 1:26:20.166
if the problem
she has with you as a filmmaker

1:26:20.250 --> 1:26:22.416
is the same problem
I have with you as a partner.

1:26:23.166 --> 1:26:24.000
Well…

1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:30.583
All that being said and done,
Karen thinks I'm a fucking tour-de-force.

1:26:30.666 --> 1:26:32.833
-[urinating]
-[scoffs] Now you like her review?

1:26:32.916 --> 1:26:36.125
[scoffs] Fucking masterwork is
what you're looking at right now, girl.

1:26:36.208 --> 1:26:38.583
[groans and chuckles]
You're joking, but I'm not.

1:26:38.666 --> 1:26:42.291
That's unfortunate, because I really
can't keep arguing about this shit.

1:26:42.375 --> 1:26:45.041
The more I think about it,
her problem is my problem.

1:26:45.125 --> 1:26:48.666
-Which is what?
-That I'm with you. I haven't walked out.

1:26:48.750 --> 1:26:50.875
I'm not wondering
what other movies are playing.

1:26:50.958 --> 1:26:53.250
I got you. I'm on your side,
and then you just…

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:55.375
You gotta fucking take shit too far.

1:26:55.458 --> 1:26:56.583
[Malcolm] Come on.

1:26:56.666 --> 1:26:59.833
No, we're in a fight,
maybe the worst fight we've ever been in,

1:26:59.916 --> 1:27:03.291
but instead of just making your point
and saying it's not about you,

1:27:03.375 --> 1:27:04.958
it's an amalgamation of people,

1:27:05.041 --> 1:27:08.125
you gotta fucking revel in it.
You gotta twist the knife

1:27:08.208 --> 1:27:13.291
and put images in my head that you and I
both know will never fucking leave me.

1:27:13.375 --> 1:27:14.333
[Malcolm] What?

1:27:15.291 --> 1:27:16.666
-Kiki.
-Oh!

1:27:16.750 --> 1:27:17.583
Kiki.

1:27:17.666 --> 1:27:20.000
-I was angry. What the fuck!
-From outside of St. Louis.

1:27:20.083 --> 1:27:23.291
-A heart-shaped bathtub?
-I was angry.

1:27:23.375 --> 1:27:25.583
You're a cheeseball. Ugh! Malcolm!

1:27:25.666 --> 1:27:27.625
-Ew! Ew!
-[laughing]

1:27:27.708 --> 1:27:28.875
Ugh!

1:27:29.375 --> 1:27:33.291
You're a fucking moron, honestly.
You could've won without all that shit.

1:27:33.375 --> 1:27:35.791
You could've won
with 20% of what you said,

1:27:35.875 --> 1:27:38.708
but you cannot help yourself.
It is just who you are.

1:27:38.791 --> 1:27:42.500
'Cause if I were ever fucked
in a penthouse suite of a Marriott,

1:27:42.583 --> 1:27:45.000
in or around a heart-shaped bathtub,

1:27:45.083 --> 1:27:49.250
I would never fucking
utter a word about it aloud.

1:27:49.333 --> 1:27:51.708
I would never tell my friends about it,

1:27:51.791 --> 1:27:53.875
I would never wield it
in a fight as a weapon.

1:27:53.958 --> 1:27:55.791
You know why?
Because I know it would hurt me

1:27:55.875 --> 1:27:57.541
way more than it would hurt you.

1:27:58.916 --> 1:28:01.791
[sighing] And it's a bummer,
Malcolm, you know?

1:28:02.333 --> 1:28:05.708
I really enjoyed having sex with you.
Up until about 15 minutes ago,

1:28:05.791 --> 1:28:09.666
it was an aspect of our relationship
that I genuinely had no complaints about.

1:28:11.750 --> 1:28:14.500
It was also my only remaining vice,
that and cigarettes.

1:28:15.875 --> 1:28:19.500
But, well, lo and behold,
you had to take shit too far…

1:28:19.583 --> 1:28:20.500
[Malcolm] Come on.

1:28:20.583 --> 1:28:24.916
And obliterate any and all joy
there was to be found in fucking you.

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.875
The gloves were off, okay?
We were in a fight, like…

1:28:27.958 --> 1:28:32.750
Oh, it didn't support your argument.
It just grossed me the fuck out.

1:28:32.833 --> 1:28:36.916
It made me go,
"I cannot believe I have unprotected sex

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.875
with this nasty-ass,
grimy-dicked fuckin' brute,

1:28:40.958 --> 1:28:44.750
a fuckin' animal,
a fuckin' barnyard animal."

1:28:44.833 --> 1:28:47.125
-[chuckles]
-That's what you are. A fuckin' hog.

1:28:47.208 --> 1:28:50.750
You are a shit-where-you-eat hog.
Hog of a human being.

1:28:50.833 --> 1:28:53.750
-[gags]
-[Malcolm laughing]

1:28:53.833 --> 1:28:55.541
Yeah, you fuckin' think it's funny.

1:28:55.625 --> 1:28:57.833
-You're being dramatic.
-I'm not being dramatic.

1:28:57.916 --> 1:29:00.875
You think 'cause we had a common enemy
in Karen from the LA Times,

1:29:00.958 --> 1:29:02.916
all shit is sweet. We good now?

1:29:03.625 --> 1:29:05.791
Think again, motherfucker. We ain't good.

1:29:05.875 --> 1:29:07.041
-[chuckles]
-[Malcolm laughing]

1:29:07.125 --> 1:29:09.708
She's my spiritual sister. I mean that.

1:29:09.791 --> 1:29:11.375
We're both seeking refuge

1:29:11.458 --> 1:29:14.541
from your assaultive,
battering ram of a fucking personality.

1:29:14.625 --> 1:29:18.250
Because of your limitations
as a partner, and a filmmaker,

1:29:18.333 --> 1:29:20.333
we are both ducking for cover.

1:29:20.833 --> 1:29:24.750
We may not have a lot in common,
but sis and I are in the fucking foxhole.

1:29:24.833 --> 1:29:27.083
Oh, you are
the last person to talk, Marie.

1:29:27.166 --> 1:29:29.875
You have fucked,
dated some of the wildest,

1:29:29.958 --> 1:29:32.833
strangest human beings
that ever walked this planet Earth.

1:29:32.916 --> 1:29:36.833
You have, one, no fucking standards,
which is a red flag.

1:29:36.916 --> 1:29:39.833
Two, no fucking type,
which is also a red flag.

1:29:39.916 --> 1:29:41.291
And three, no discretion.

1:29:41.375 --> 1:29:43.958
Which means everyone who knows you,
knows you're a red flag

1:29:44.041 --> 1:29:45.916
and talks about you're a red fucking flag.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.833
Well, Malcolm, here's the difference.

1:29:47.916 --> 1:29:53.458
I'm not lugging my balls around this house
bragging about the places they've been.

1:29:54.333 --> 1:29:55.666
I don't need to know the details.

1:29:55.750 --> 1:29:59.958
I don't need to know all the…
the moves and the steps

1:30:00.041 --> 1:30:03.166
and the places that brought you
to my doorstep. You're here.

1:30:04.791 --> 1:30:07.416
I loved you unconditionally. Why?

1:30:08.625 --> 1:30:10.833
Because I value mystery.

1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:14.875
The unknown. It's what supports
the tension of a relationship

1:30:14.958 --> 1:30:18.291
and forces us to be the best version
of ourselves. The what-if factor.

1:30:18.916 --> 1:30:22.333
What if there's someone
who loved him better?

1:30:23.958 --> 1:30:26.291
Who was smarter, nicer.

1:30:26.375 --> 1:30:29.291
Woke him up every day
with breakfast and a blowjob.

1:30:30.583 --> 1:30:33.041
What if I'm not
the best girlfriend he's ever had?

1:30:33.833 --> 1:30:36.041
What if he dreams of someone else?

1:30:36.125 --> 1:30:39.458
Better conversations,
a girl with hips and an actual ass

1:30:39.541 --> 1:30:42.625
instead of this string bean body?

1:30:42.708 --> 1:30:45.500
Look, I know a little bit about your type.

1:30:45.583 --> 1:30:49.458
Not so much that I'm paralyzed
with insecurity and doubt.

1:30:50.875 --> 1:30:53.208
So that every single day when I get up,

1:30:54.041 --> 1:30:57.041
and I talk to you,
and I wear this fancy fuckin' dress,

1:30:57.125 --> 1:30:58.708
and I hold your hand,

1:30:58.791 --> 1:31:02.708
I'm trying to be the best girlfriend
you have ever had.

1:31:04.625 --> 1:31:07.625
So, when you tell me
that who I'm up against is Kiki…

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:10.708
-Here we go with the bullshit. Here we go.
-…from St. Louis,

1:31:10.791 --> 1:31:15.041
in a heart-shaped bathtub,
it makes me give a lot less of a fuck.

1:31:15.125 --> 1:31:16.750
You gotta bring up all the shit.

1:31:16.833 --> 1:31:19.666
I don't know where you're going,
but I'm not done.

1:31:21.250 --> 1:31:23.750
I'm not even fucking close to being done.

1:31:25.041 --> 1:31:26.625
[Malcolm sighs]

1:31:26.708 --> 1:31:30.333
But what it also makes me realize,
the reason you don't get jealous

1:31:30.416 --> 1:31:33.041
is because you don't
value that mystery, do you?

1:31:33.625 --> 1:31:35.125
The reason you don't value it,

1:31:35.958 --> 1:31:39.000
the reason why you never wonder
if you're the best fuck I've ever had,

1:31:39.083 --> 1:31:41.666
or the most talented person
I've ever been with,

1:31:41.750 --> 1:31:43.791
or the kindest, or the smartest,

1:31:44.500 --> 1:31:46.458
it's because it is inconceivable to you

1:31:46.541 --> 1:31:50.291
that there is anybody on this planet
that is more interesting than you are.

1:31:51.208 --> 1:31:52.166
[clicks tongue]

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:56.416
Your lack of curiosity is merely
an extension of your narcissism,

1:31:56.500 --> 1:31:59.791
your megalomania,
your egotistical view of the world.

1:32:00.666 --> 1:32:02.250
As a result of never doubting yourself,

1:32:02.333 --> 1:32:07.208
you never stopped to ask yourself,
"How can I be a better partner?"

1:32:11.666 --> 1:32:15.000
You're good. You are set.

1:32:16.541 --> 1:32:20.041
The man I'm looking at right now
is as good as he's gonna get.

1:32:24.166 --> 1:32:25.708
You yelling at me in a bathtub

1:32:25.791 --> 1:32:28.333
about how you're
gonna snap me like a twig,

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:32.916
is the best and worst of who
you will be in this relationship.

1:32:37.625 --> 1:32:40.625
And that's why you can forget
to thank me in your speech.

1:32:42.458 --> 1:32:46.458
Because you're not afraid that I'm gonna
come home and go… [inhales deeply]

1:32:46.583 --> 1:32:50.791
"You know what? You lost me tonight.
Fuck this shit. I am out."

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:57.875
But if you steamroll every single person
in your midst, day in and day out,

1:32:57.958 --> 1:33:02.458
you are going to end up living
in a fictional fucking reality.

1:33:05.583 --> 1:33:06.666
Look at me.

1:33:09.833 --> 1:33:11.750
I'm the last person standing.

1:33:13.125 --> 1:33:18.875
I'm the last person to look at you and go,
"You know what? Up your fucking game."

1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:21.541
"If not for me, then for your work."

1:33:23.791 --> 1:33:27.458
Malcolm, if this is a movie,
you hold on to me for dear fucking life.

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:31.250
Because that's who
we've been for one another.

1:33:31.958 --> 1:33:36.333
That's who you've been for me
and I've been for you from the day we met.

1:33:38.416 --> 1:33:42.250
From the day I overdosed in that market,
from the day you drove me to rehab.

1:33:42.833 --> 1:33:44.750
From the first day I read your script

1:33:44.833 --> 1:33:48.958
about me, about us,
about our relationship.

1:33:50.666 --> 1:33:53.333
About how drugs
were destroying my ability to love you

1:33:53.416 --> 1:33:55.375
and your ability to love me.

1:34:02.541 --> 1:34:05.791
All I wanted tonight
was a "thank you," Malcolm. That is it.

1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:08.500
That's all.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.125
"Thank you, Marie.
Thank you for loving me."

1:34:14.958 --> 1:34:18.375
"Thank you for making my life better,
for getting your life together."

1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:22.833
"Thank you for watching 100 cuts
and reading 100 fucking drafts."

1:34:22.916 --> 1:34:26.333
"Thank you for your notes,
your experience, your patience,

1:34:26.416 --> 1:34:30.625
your authen-fucking-ticity
you bring to this film. Thank you."

1:34:32.375 --> 1:34:35.500
"Thank you for being a drug addict.
Thank you for being clean."

1:34:36.250 --> 1:34:40.125
"Thank you for dumb shit,
like buying toilet paper and milk

1:34:40.208 --> 1:34:43.291
and organizing
the shit with the movers. Thank you."

1:34:43.375 --> 1:34:45.541
"Thank you for doing
the shit I don't wanna think about."

1:34:45.625 --> 1:34:48.666
"Thank you for making me coffee.
Thank you for making me smile."

1:34:49.416 --> 1:34:52.708
"Thank you for the good sex
and the cuddles."

1:34:53.875 --> 1:34:54.916
[Malcolm sniffs]

1:34:56.333 --> 1:34:59.875
"Thank you for doing the laundry
and picking out my suit tonight

1:34:59.958 --> 1:35:03.083
and making my ungrateful ass
some mac and cheese

1:35:03.166 --> 1:35:05.416
after I forgot to fuckin' thank you."

1:35:11.750 --> 1:35:14.666
"Thank you for the mistakes you've made…

1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:21.041
for the charm you bring,
the life you bring."

1:35:21.125 --> 1:35:22.791
"Thank you for loving me."

1:35:25.166 --> 1:35:29.166
"Thank you for getting over this,
for moving forward, for being you."

1:35:30.958 --> 1:35:33.875
"Thank you for all the shit
I forget to thank you for…

1:35:35.041 --> 1:35:38.916
and thank you for looking
so goddamn sexy in that dress tonight."

1:35:43.708 --> 1:35:45.083
"You make me look good."

1:35:46.375 --> 1:35:48.083
"You make me a better person."

1:35:53.041 --> 1:35:54.583
"Thank you for understanding

1:35:55.333 --> 1:35:58.041
that I'm not always great
at expressing how I feel

1:35:58.791 --> 1:36:01.458
and it comes out in my work
more than in real life."

1:36:03.166 --> 1:36:04.458
"Thank you because…

1:36:07.708 --> 1:36:11.583
I know it doesn't always feel good,
so I hope you can live with that."

1:36:16.291 --> 1:36:18.166
[voice breaking] "Thank you."

1:36:18.250 --> 1:36:20.500
"I know I'm emotionally obtuse sometimes,

1:36:20.583 --> 1:36:23.041
but I'm grateful
you don't hold it against me."

1:36:24.166 --> 1:36:25.166
"Thank you…

1:36:27.416 --> 1:36:29.041
for assuming the best."

1:36:31.833 --> 1:36:35.958
"I love you, Marie.
I'll always love you, my Marie."

1:36:37.625 --> 1:36:38.625
"Thank you."

1:36:40.333 --> 1:36:43.083
"From the bottom of my heart, thank you."

1:36:52.375 --> 1:36:53.750
I love you, Marie.

1:37:03.291 --> 1:37:05.041
[jazz music playing]

1:37:15.333 --> 1:37:17.458
[slow jazz music playing]

1:40:00.708 --> 1:40:02.041
[Malcolm sighs]

1:40:06.791 --> 1:40:08.041
I'm sorry.

1:40:18.125 --> 1:40:19.291
Thank you.
