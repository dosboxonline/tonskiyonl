01:36.504 --> 01:37.881
Jesus!

01:40.300 --> 01:42.969
Are you still there?

01:43.052 --> 01:44.429
No, I'm back.

01:44.512 --> 01:47.390
I'm not sure I got the spelling.

01:47.474 --> 01:51.352
It is a "Y" Okay, great.
Yes, thank you. Bye.

02:01.738 --> 02:04.824
Honey, you there?
Pick up, pick up.

02:04.908 --> 02:08.953
You're not there. Okay.
Look, it's a little after 6:00.

02:09.078 --> 02:11.789
I'll catch a ride
and see you out there. Bye.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.087
- Jack.
- Yeah?

02:18.129 --> 02:22.550
The Balkans peace council is "comprised"
or "composed" of ten members?

02:22.634 --> 02:24.093
Twelve members.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.095
Oh, right. Thanks.

02:27.555 --> 02:29.015
Composed.

02:30.225 --> 02:31.518
What?

02:33.770 --> 02:37.190
A three-block area
has been evacuated.

02:37.232 --> 02:40.235
You might wanna avoid that route
coming home from work.

03:17.105 --> 03:20.817
- What do you think, Cy?
- This'll make them sweat. It's good.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.528
- I'll lead with it.
- Great. I'll see you Monday.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.405
What?

03:25.488 --> 03:27.740
- I gotta go.
- Come on, John.

03:27.824 --> 03:32.745
It'll look bad, my star reporter
not showing up at the Christmas party.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.709
I can't.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.711
Mary's waiting for me.

04:34.015 --> 04:37.811
It's a big house, isn't it?
It's a steal at this price.

04:38.436 --> 04:40.271
That's if you want it.

04:40.355 --> 04:42.774
But we're gonna have to
make an offer today.

04:42.857 --> 04:45.735
The owner's highly motivated.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.363
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.657
Take a look around.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.659
Okay.
Thank you, Brian.

04:52.742 --> 04:54.202
Thank you very much.

04:59.082 --> 05:01.459
It's okay.
We're just gonna look.

05:06.506 --> 05:08.133
My God.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.847
Here you are.

05:55.930 --> 05:59.350
We were just making sure
there was adequate closet space.

05:59.434 --> 06:01.019
Good. Good.

06:01.144 --> 06:03.646
Well, this house is yours
if you want it...

06:03.730 --> 06:06.232
but you have to decide right now.

06:06.357 --> 06:07.817
We'll take it.

06:07.942 --> 06:10.361
Really? Oh, my God!

06:47.065 --> 06:49.984
You know what I kept thinking
when we were looking at that house?

06:50.068 --> 06:52.987
That we should get
a mattress for that closet.

06:58.785 --> 07:02.288
I kept thinking that
it felt like a dream come true.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.548
Come here.

07:17.887 --> 07:20.890
- How fast can you drive this thing?
- Really fast.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.058
Let's see.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.227
Okay.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.573
- We bought a really, really...
- Excuse me. We bought a house.

07:36.614 --> 07:38.700
We bought a big house.

08:08.897 --> 08:10.356
Mary.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.282
Mary, are you all right?
Mary, talk to me.

08:19.365 --> 08:20.742
Are you okay?

08:23.995 --> 08:26.581
Can you hear me?
Jesus Christ!

08:29.250 --> 08:31.044
Hold on, darling.

08:31.961 --> 08:34.964
911, there's been an accident.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.466
Yes.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.033
Nothing.

09:07.539 --> 09:09.457
You okay?

09:11.167 --> 09:12.710
Yeah.

09:14.712 --> 09:16.798
All right.
It's all right.

09:21.678 --> 09:23.930
It's all right.
It's just me.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.980
You didn't see it, did you?

09:34.440 --> 09:35.859
See what?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.573
What did you see?

09:45.994 --> 09:47.954
I didn't see anything.

09:56.212 --> 09:58.131
There's something wrong with me.

10:49.057 --> 10:51.518
It's called a glioblastoma.

10:52.644 --> 10:55.063
It's a temporal lobe tumor.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.608
According to the doctor,
it's extremely rare.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.735
One in...

11:00.819 --> 11:02.821
600,000 gets this thing.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.782
Did they say it was
a result of the accident?

11:07.283 --> 11:09.410
No, it turns out...

11:09.494 --> 11:11.412
that it's been there a while.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.917
There's nothing else they can do?

11:17.418 --> 11:20.713
They did the surgery, and they
couldn't get it all out, so they'll...

11:22.132 --> 11:24.134
keep her on the chemo...

11:24.217 --> 11:26.678
as long as her strength holds out.

11:28.638 --> 11:31.850
That's working.
I think she's looking better now.

11:33.351 --> 11:34.811
Good.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.229
That's good.

11:38.857 --> 11:40.733
Two weeks ago...

11:40.817 --> 11:42.735
we were house hunting.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.703
One day you're just
driving along in your car...

11:51.786 --> 11:54.080
and the universe...

11:54.122 --> 11:56.249
just points at you and says...

11:56.332 --> 12:00.378
"Ah, there you are, a happy couple.

12:00.461 --> 12:02.881
I've been looking for you.

12:04.215 --> 12:06.134
I've been looking for you".

12:09.888 --> 12:11.389
I'm sorry.

12:12.682 --> 12:14.142
For what?

12:18.229 --> 12:20.148
For all of this.

12:23.735 --> 12:26.696
I feel like I ruined everything.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.834
You didn't ruin anything.

12:40.919 --> 12:42.837
Not a damn thing.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.009
I want you to be happy.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.750
You didn't see it, did you?

14:56.387 --> 14:57.806
Yes.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.102
Yeah?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.395
She knew.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.900
What?

16:32.692 --> 16:35.653
She was drawing angels.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.183
It was the meanness
of the campaigns...

17:47.267 --> 17:51.020
the almost complete lack
of candor and honesty...

17:51.104 --> 17:53.022
that turned the voters off..

17:55.984 --> 17:58.695
I think that these parties
are demonizing each other.

17:59.863 --> 18:03.449
They're projecting our own
personal fears and anxieties...

18:03.533 --> 18:05.451
onto the national stage.

18:05.535 --> 18:10.165
People don't like it. People are
very, very unsatisfied at the moment.

18:10.248 --> 18:14.210
It makes them complacent because they
don't see any possibility of change.

18:14.335 --> 18:18.465
2004... Is there a dark horse candidate
out there for the Democrats?

18:18.590 --> 18:20.884
Well, I'm hearing a lot
about Russ McCallum.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.386
- Governor of Virginia.
- Yeah, he might do what Carter...

18:27.557 --> 18:30.143
Hey, I told her to watch.

18:30.226 --> 18:31.519
Who?

18:31.603 --> 18:33.062
Peter's friend Gwen.

18:34.022 --> 18:35.940
She'll be there tonight.

18:35.982 --> 18:40.278
Oh, God. Look, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make that one tonight.

18:40.361 --> 18:42.864
Come on, you can't keep
blowing this thing off.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.241
I'm not. I've got an interview
with the governor.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.911
I gotta be in Richmond
at 8:00 in the morning.

18:50.413 --> 18:53.833
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.377
They bumped the meeting
till tomorrow night.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.718
Eddie, look, I...

19:03.802 --> 19:04.719
Look...

19:06.554 --> 19:08.640
she's not Mary.

19:08.723 --> 19:10.350
Not by a mile.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.019
But you know what?

19:14.479 --> 19:16.397
No one ever will be.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.357
Hey, Ed.
I'm sorry about today.

20:01.442 --> 20:04.028
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.

20:04.112 --> 20:06.489
Maybe some other time.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.616
It's about 1:00 in the morning.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.536
I'm a little wired,
so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.371
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.

21:06.549 --> 21:08.384
Al I right, come on.

22:31.885 --> 22:35.889
Hi. I'm sorry. I know it's really late,
but my car broke down just up the road.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.516
I wondered if I could use the phone.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.018
Hello.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.146
It's him.

22:46.649 --> 22:48.610
I been waitin' for you.

22:49.611 --> 22:52.280
You son of a bitch.
What are you doin'?

22:52.363 --> 22:54.449
Get the door! Get the door!

22:56.409 --> 22:57.911
Just stay right there.

23:00.371 --> 23:02.123
Mister, I don't know who you...

23:02.207 --> 23:03.124
Shut up!

23:04.751 --> 23:06.169
Shut up.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.090
Honey, Connie's here.

23:12.383 --> 23:14.928
Well, hey, Gordon.
How you doin'?

23:16.888 --> 23:19.349
Okay, why don't you just...

23:19.390 --> 23:22.769
put down the gun and tell me
what's going on here.

23:23.686 --> 23:24.854
Yeah.

23:30.902 --> 23:34.864
He's come around three nights in a row.
This son of a bitch is stalking us.

23:34.906 --> 23:39.536
- I'm John Klein. My car broke down...
- Let's let Gordon finish, Mr. Klein.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.247
Two nights ago...

23:42.330 --> 23:46.292
at 2:30 in the a.m.,
there's a bang on the door.

23:47.168 --> 23:49.629
I open it up, and here's this guy.

23:49.754 --> 23:51.923
He says he wants to use the phone.

23:52.006 --> 23:54.717
But there's something
creepy about him...

23:54.801 --> 23:56.886
so I tell him to get lost.

23:56.970 --> 23:59.681
Last night at 2:30 on the dot,
guess who's back.

23:59.764 --> 24:01.683
You're sure it was Mr. Klein here?

24:01.766 --> 24:04.310
I am absolutely positive
it's Mr. Klein.

24:04.978 --> 24:07.897
- Crazy. This is...
- I am not crazy.

24:07.939 --> 24:11.151
- I didn't say that you...
- So then what happened?

24:11.234 --> 24:13.903
I warned him off my property.

24:13.945 --> 24:15.905
I used the word "trespass",
and he still came back.

24:15.947 --> 24:20.034
You're lucky I'm a Christian, because I
had the right to shoot you on my porch.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.162
He'd have to been
inside the house, Gordon.

24:22.245 --> 24:23.705
What?

24:23.788 --> 24:25.206
Fine.

24:25.248 --> 24:29.210
So tonight I figured the dumb fuck might
come back, and sure enough, there he is.

24:31.254 --> 24:32.797
It wasn't me.

24:32.881 --> 24:35.884
I don't know what's happening here.

24:35.925 --> 24:37.802
Something's very wrong here.

24:39.345 --> 24:42.307
I don't know these people.
I have never been here before.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.601
I'm from DC. Look.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.187
It's a wallet, okay? Wallet?

24:48.563 --> 24:49.939
I'm from DC.

24:50.023 --> 24:51.983
My name is John Klein.

24:59.616 --> 25:00.909
Washington Post.

25:00.992 --> 25:02.410
Yes.

25:06.998 --> 25:09.083
Can I get out of this shower now?

25:15.548 --> 25:18.051
You can wait for me outside,
Mr. Klein.

25:21.513 --> 25:26.059
We'll run a check on him.
Anyone else comes by, forget the gun.

25:26.184 --> 25:28.102
Just call me.

25:28.186 --> 25:30.563
Just find out what he wants.

25:44.494 --> 25:47.455
So, you didn't actually see the guy
before tonight?

25:47.497 --> 25:48.957
No.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.960
But I heard the knocking.

25:52.001 --> 25:54.087
Three nights in a row.

25:57.507 --> 25:59.425
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

26:04.639 --> 26:08.017
I'm gonna give you a ride into town,
unless you wanna sleep in your car.

26:08.101 --> 26:10.520
I can call for a tow in the morning.

26:16.192 --> 26:18.486
You're a long way from DC.

26:19.487 --> 26:21.447
What are you doing here?

26:22.574 --> 26:24.033
Driving through.

26:25.618 --> 26:28.538
We're not on the way
to anyplace, Mr. Klein.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.176
I recognize you.

26:43.887 --> 26:45.221
DC Review.

26:47.056 --> 26:50.435
- You watch that?
- We're not all bumpkins.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.897
So I'm not under arrest?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.566
You didn't steal anything.
You didn't hurt anybody.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.985
No breaking and entering.

26:59.068 --> 27:00.945
You've had trouble with him before?

27:00.987 --> 27:04.032
Gordy and Denise? No.

27:04.115 --> 27:05.533
They're good people.

27:06.659 --> 27:09.579
Things have just been
a little strange around here lately.

27:23.134 --> 27:26.596
You still haven't told me what you're
doing here in the middle of the night.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.224
I don't know.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.023
Where am I?

27:58.628 --> 28:01.005
Think you could show me
where we are on the map here?

28:01.089 --> 28:03.591
We're right on the state line.

28:10.306 --> 28:11.766
With Ohio.

28:36.583 --> 28:39.627
- What time did you leave DC?
- 1:00 in the morning.

28:39.711 --> 28:43.214
If I was doing 80 the whole way, it
would've taken me six hours to get here.

28:43.298 --> 28:46.676
- There's gotta be a logical explanation.
- I don't know.

28:46.759 --> 28:51.264
By the way, don't worry about your pal
the governor. I'll take care of it.

28:51.389 --> 28:52.891
Yeah. Okay.

28:53.016 --> 28:54.392
Thanks, Eddie.

28:54.476 --> 28:57.145
- So?
- It's running fine, Mr. Klein.

28:57.228 --> 28:59.772
- Can't find a thing wrong with her.
- Really?

29:01.107 --> 29:02.525
Strange.

29:04.068 --> 29:07.030
- All right, what do I owe you?
- Nothin'.

29:08.072 --> 29:10.992
I said I can't find
anything wrong with her.

29:48.905 --> 29:49.989
Mr. Smallwood.

29:53.952 --> 29:55.537
Mr. Smallwood...

29:58.998 --> 30:03.419
I just wanted to apologize for that
misunderstanding we had last night.

30:05.630 --> 30:09.217
Are you sure it was me that came by
the last couple of nights?

30:10.301 --> 30:12.011
Listen, mister.

30:12.095 --> 30:13.972
Connie called me.

30:14.055 --> 30:17.934
She told me that you check out,
and that's good enough for me.

30:18.017 --> 30:22.188
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.

30:22.939 --> 30:25.900
But I don't drink anymore...

30:25.984 --> 30:27.986
and I don't lie.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.905
And as far as I know, I'm not crazy.

30:30.989 --> 30:33.741
So if you're accusing me...

30:39.747 --> 30:41.708
Look, here's the thing.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.421
I don't know how
I ended up here last night.

30:48.631 --> 30:51.468
I didn't even know
I was in West Virginia.

30:52.427 --> 30:54.721
Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30...

30:54.804 --> 30:59.350
I traveled 400 miles and ended up
on that road by your house...

31:01.644 --> 31:04.731
and I've got no memory of it.

31:07.358 --> 31:09.569
And you call me crazy?

32:01.621 --> 32:04.541
I was afraid I'd see you here.

32:15.802 --> 32:16.719
Okay.

32:19.264 --> 32:21.891
You didn't show up.

32:21.975 --> 32:24.477
Too bad. I really wanted
to know what I look like.

32:26.896 --> 32:29.315
Sergeant, I'm curious.

32:29.399 --> 32:31.401
Last night you said...

32:31.484 --> 32:34.362
things had been strange...

32:34.445 --> 32:35.864
around here lately.

32:35.905 --> 32:39.200
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.

32:40.368 --> 32:42.328
Now I really need to know.

32:42.370 --> 32:44.998
Just your odd reports.

32:45.123 --> 32:49.419
People seeing things they can't explain,
so they all come to me.

32:49.502 --> 32:51.087
'Cause you're the cop.

32:53.590 --> 32:55.341
Because they know me.

33:01.097 --> 33:04.642
You know, if there are
other people in this town...

33:04.726 --> 33:06.686
who are feeling as...

33:07.854 --> 33:09.772
confused as I am right now...

33:09.856 --> 33:11.441
I'd sure like to hear it.

33:19.908 --> 33:23.328
The past few months,
people have been coming up to me...

33:23.411 --> 33:26.164
and reporting that they've
been seeing strange things.

33:26.247 --> 33:30.794
I don't mean the town speed freak.
I mean good, honest, church going people.

33:32.295 --> 33:34.214
I've known these folks
my entire life...

33:34.297 --> 33:36.591
and they seem down right embarrassed
to be bringing it up.

33:36.674 --> 33:38.426
Bringing what up?

33:38.510 --> 33:40.595
It's hard to explain.

34:17.132 --> 34:19.634
Weird lights,
strange phone calls, you.

34:20.969 --> 34:23.221
Seeing a UFO is one thing.

34:23.346 --> 34:27.225
What do you do when someone tells you
they saw this in their backyard?

34:34.649 --> 34:36.067
What is it?

34:39.862 --> 34:41.447
My wife died two years ago.

34:48.663 --> 34:50.873
She saw something.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.500
Drew pictures.

34:54.627 --> 34:56.087
Who showed you this?

35:08.266 --> 35:09.934
It was right here.

35:11.144 --> 35:14.981
There was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch.

35:15.064 --> 35:17.400
That makes it about...

35:17.484 --> 35:19.652
eight feet tall.

35:19.694 --> 35:21.571
Yeah.

35:21.654 --> 35:25.992
I was getting ready for bed and just
happened to glance out the window.

35:26.910 --> 35:28.828
At first all I could see...

35:28.912 --> 35:32.332
were these two red eyes.

35:32.373 --> 35:34.334
I kept looking at it.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.378
I couldn't stop.

35:38.963 --> 35:42.383
I've never had that feeling before,
like I couldn't move.

35:44.052 --> 35:46.262
And then I guess it just...

35:47.430 --> 35:48.681
took off..

35:55.146 --> 35:57.899
That may not make much sense,
but it's...

35:58.650 --> 36:01.361
the only way I can put it into words.

36:19.379 --> 36:21.631
You didn't see it, did you?

36:32.934 --> 36:35.061
It started about two months ago.

36:36.729 --> 36:40.024
Every time I answered the phone
I'd hear it.

36:40.108 --> 36:43.862
The first one was just
a loud beeping noise.

36:43.945 --> 36:48.158
Now they're mostly
these creaking, howling sounds.

36:49.909 --> 36:51.411
They all like this?

36:51.453 --> 36:55.331
Well, once it was a man
talking really fast.

36:55.415 --> 36:58.084
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.

36:58.168 --> 37:01.921
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?

37:02.005 --> 37:04.674
I even had our number changed.

37:04.757 --> 37:08.178
But before I got a chance
to give it out to anyone...

37:09.762 --> 37:11.306
the calls started again.

37:16.311 --> 37:19.981
It's not a question of believing them.
Like I said, they're honest people.

37:20.064 --> 37:22.567
- How long you lived here?
- My whole life.

37:22.609 --> 37:25.445
- I grew up right over that hill.
- On a farm?

37:25.528 --> 37:27.071
Shucks, no.
A real live house.

37:27.947 --> 37:30.325
Indoor plumbing and everything.

37:30.408 --> 37:31.743
Sorry.

37:31.826 --> 37:34.329
We even had shoes for church
and schoolin' and stuff.

37:34.370 --> 37:35.663
All right, all right.

37:41.044 --> 37:42.962
Where the hell are you?

37:43.046 --> 37:44.506
I'm still here.

37:44.589 --> 37:46.633
- West Virginia?
- Yeah.

37:48.301 --> 37:49.552
Something's come up.

37:49.636 --> 37:52.514
You're kidding. Something of
national interest in West Virginia?

37:52.597 --> 37:55.558
No, scientific.
I'll tell you about it later.

37:57.769 --> 38:00.188
Cy's beginning to look rabid.

38:00.271 --> 38:01.815
Keep him at bay, okay?

38:01.898 --> 38:04.484
Are you okay?
You sound a little stressed.

38:04.567 --> 38:06.986
No, I'm fine.
I'll talk to you later.

38:24.629 --> 38:26.756
We were parked up here...

38:26.840 --> 38:29.008
and sort a making out
in the back seat.

38:43.314 --> 38:45.692
And what happened next...

38:45.775 --> 38:48.236
is sort of hard to explain.

39:16.514 --> 39:17.599
Next day...

39:18.933 --> 39:21.478
I woke up and...

39:21.561 --> 39:23.438
both my...

39:23.521 --> 39:25.440
my eyes were swelled up.

39:28.401 --> 39:30.195
What did the doctors say?

39:30.904 --> 39:32.822
He couldn't explain it.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.452
See this one here?

39:39.454 --> 39:41.581
It ain't never healed.

39:47.253 --> 39:49.172
We're getting engaged.

39:51.966 --> 39:53.426
That's good.

41:25.518 --> 41:28.646
- I gotta talk to you.
- Okay.

41:32.025 --> 41:34.694
Last night I woke up...

41:35.945 --> 41:38.865
with the worst headache
I've ever had in my life.

41:39.574 --> 41:43.661
I went into the bathroom
to get some aspirin...

41:43.745 --> 41:46.372
and I happened
to look in the mirror...

41:47.457 --> 41:49.459
and...

41:49.542 --> 41:51.669
I swear to God...

41:51.753 --> 41:53.671
I see something...

41:53.755 --> 41:55.340
I can't describe.

41:56.508 --> 41:58.259
But it sure as hell...

41:58.343 --> 42:00.094
is not my reflection.

42:01.429 --> 42:03.306
And then...

42:03.389 --> 42:04.724
I hear...

42:05.558 --> 42:07.018
this weird...

42:09.312 --> 42:10.647
howl...

42:11.731 --> 42:13.608
coming out of the sink.

42:16.194 --> 42:18.071
And there's a voice.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.119
It's a voice...

42:25.411 --> 42:27.205
and it's saying...

42:27.247 --> 42:29.916
"Do not be afraid.

42:29.999 --> 42:32.252
Ninety-nine will die.

42:33.878 --> 42:35.338
Denver Nine".

42:37.257 --> 42:38.925
I even wrote it down.

42:41.344 --> 42:44.514
He just keeps saying the same thing
over and over for an hour...

42:44.556 --> 42:47.308
and then it stops.

42:47.392 --> 42:50.395
And when I wake up this morning
I look at this piece of paper...

42:50.478 --> 42:53.648
where I wrote down the words...

42:54.816 --> 42:57.485
and this thing is on it.

42:58.319 --> 43:00.238
I did not draw that.

43:27.307 --> 43:29.184
- Gordon?
- What?

43:29.225 --> 43:32.312
Gordon, you...
your ear's bleeding.

43:32.353 --> 43:33.813
What?

43:50.830 --> 43:52.791
This CAT scan is clean, Gordon.

43:52.832 --> 43:54.751
No sign of any physical problem.

43:54.834 --> 43:59.631
Are you sure?
Because this man's wife had a tumor.

43:59.672 --> 44:02.217
What you had, Gordon,
was a first-class migraine.

44:02.300 --> 44:05.637
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.

44:05.720 --> 44:08.223
- Thank you, Doctor.
- There were other symptoms, Doc.

44:08.264 --> 44:11.726
He had hallucinations, heard voices.

44:11.810 --> 44:14.062
Aren't they both associated
with glioblastoma?

44:14.103 --> 44:17.232
I see nothing here to suggest...

44:17.315 --> 44:20.318
something as exotic
as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein...

44:20.401 --> 44:23.905
but if you'd like I can refer
Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist...

44:23.988 --> 44:25.949
for a second opinion.

44:27.075 --> 44:28.868
- He's wrong.
- No, that'd be fine.

44:28.952 --> 44:30.328
Thank you.

44:31.412 --> 44:33.373
Thank you very much.

44:39.087 --> 44:40.880
Wait. Wait.

44:40.964 --> 44:42.882
He's not wrong.

44:42.966 --> 44:45.426
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

44:47.428 --> 44:49.848
He's not wrong
'cause there's nothing wrong.

44:52.725 --> 44:54.144
There's nothing wrong.

45:17.459 --> 45:22.213
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear
and he tells you you got a headache...

45:22.297 --> 45:25.717
Yes, well, you're not sick,
so that is good news.

45:25.758 --> 45:29.012
I wish I was sick. Then I would
know why this is happening.

45:29.137 --> 45:31.389
You shouldn't say things like that.

45:31.473 --> 45:35.727
What should I say, Denise?
I'm hallucinating.

45:35.768 --> 45:37.437
I'm hearing voices.

45:37.520 --> 45:40.440
Was your wife hearing voices
before she had her tumor?

45:42.025 --> 45:43.485
No.

46:09.344 --> 46:14.223
13 News is headed to the scene,
and we'll have a live report in minutes.

46:14.224 --> 46:19.395
Again our top story, Domain Air
flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.

46:19.479 --> 46:23.733
An airline representative is expected
to make a statement shortly.

46:23.817 --> 46:25.235
There is no confirmation...

46:25.276 --> 46:28.321
but all 99 passengers and crew members
are believed dead.

46:38.123 --> 46:39.541
Wow, man.

46:48.341 --> 46:50.593
Could I speak to
Alexander Leek, please?

46:50.635 --> 46:53.263
- This is Leek.
- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein.

46:53.304 --> 46:55.431
I'm working on a pretty strange story.

46:55.515 --> 46:58.143
I was hoping you might be able
to help me out.

46:58.184 --> 47:02.564
I'm particularly interested in your
theories on precognition and prophecies.

47:02.647 --> 47:04.566
Anything you want to know
is in the book.

47:04.649 --> 47:09.070
Yeah, but the chapter that you have
on the entities you call...

47:09.195 --> 47:10.697
Were you contacted...

47:10.780 --> 47:13.658
or are you pretending to have
a professional interest?

47:13.741 --> 47:15.160
Yeah... No.

47:16.202 --> 47:18.413
I'm a reporter
for The Washington Post.

47:18.496 --> 47:21.749
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein.
I don't work in those areas anymore.

47:23.001 --> 47:24.461
I don't understand.

47:37.724 --> 47:40.226
To hear a voice is one thing...

47:40.310 --> 47:43.313
but this isn't just a message,
it's a prediction.

47:43.354 --> 47:44.898
It came true.

47:44.981 --> 47:49.235
These things Gordon's having,
are they dreams or hallucinations?

47:49.319 --> 47:52.572
The way he describes them,
they sound like dreams.

47:52.614 --> 47:54.032
I don't know.

47:55.617 --> 47:57.535
He believes they're real.

48:02.415 --> 48:04.334
I had a dream like that.

48:05.627 --> 48:07.086
Yeah?

48:11.925 --> 48:13.301
It was nighttime...

48:14.427 --> 48:16.846
and I was in the middle of the ocean.

48:19.474 --> 48:22.644
I was trying to swim,
but I was too cold.

48:25.271 --> 48:28.233
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something...

48:28.983 --> 48:30.610
to hang on to.

48:32.529 --> 48:34.697
And there were presents...

48:34.739 --> 48:35.990
floating all around me.

48:36.074 --> 48:38.535
They were wrapped up.
They were tied with bows.

48:40.078 --> 48:44.666
I tried to grab on to them,
but they kept popping away.

48:47.961 --> 48:50.088
And then I started to sink...

48:51.381 --> 48:52.799
like a stone.

48:55.009 --> 48:57.971
There was nothing I could do.
I was falling.

48:59.931 --> 49:01.850
But it felt good.

49:06.980 --> 49:08.606
I was letting go.

49:12.777 --> 49:15.363
I was letting myself go...

49:15.447 --> 49:17.615
and...

49:17.657 --> 49:19.159
all I could see...

49:19.242 --> 49:20.660
was black...

49:20.743 --> 49:24.247
and all I could feel
was the darkness above me...

49:24.330 --> 49:26.249
and the lights...

49:26.291 --> 49:28.209
coming from below.

49:32.380 --> 49:33.798
I knew I was dying.

49:37.177 --> 49:42.432
And then I heard this voice,
like somebody whispering in my ear.

49:42.515 --> 49:44.809
"Wake up, number 37".

49:53.985 --> 49:55.904
And then I woke up.

50:00.658 --> 50:02.577
What do you think that means?

50:04.370 --> 50:05.789
Number 37?

50:06.456 --> 50:08.374
I have absolutely no idea.

50:41.991 --> 50:43.868
I met him.

50:44.577 --> 50:47.789
The guy who told me
about the plane crash.

50:49.624 --> 50:52.127
You met him?

50:52.210 --> 50:53.128
Yeah.

50:53.878 --> 50:55.713
I met him.

50:56.297 --> 50:59.050
Last night, coming home
from work about midnight.

50:59.134 --> 51:02.095
I'm driving past the cement plant...

51:02.178 --> 51:05.348
out by the chemical factory.

51:05.473 --> 51:06.516
Right.

51:06.641 --> 51:08.560
Something happened.

51:15.567 --> 51:16.985
Bright...

51:17.026 --> 51:18.403
flash.

51:18.486 --> 51:19.529
Lightning.

51:23.950 --> 51:24.868
Something...

51:25.493 --> 51:26.411
encircles me.

51:32.959 --> 51:34.294
Everything's kind of hot.

51:36.838 --> 51:38.965
I feel like I can't catch...

51:40.383 --> 51:41.843
catch my breath.

52:16.294 --> 52:17.754
He looked human.

52:19.255 --> 52:21.591
But there was just something...

52:21.674 --> 52:23.134
wrong about him.

52:25.428 --> 52:27.347
That's when I heard the voice.

52:28.139 --> 52:30.308
The same voice
that I heard two nights ago.

52:31.059 --> 52:32.811
He said...

52:32.852 --> 52:34.813
"Do not be afraid.

52:36.064 --> 52:37.649
My name...

52:37.732 --> 52:40.693
is Indrid Cold".

52:46.116 --> 52:47.659
And he said to me...

52:47.784 --> 52:49.744
"In a place this size.

52:49.786 --> 52:52.288
Equator.

52:52.372 --> 52:54.332
Three hundred.

52:54.374 --> 52:57.210
Three hundred will die.

53:00.004 --> 53:01.589
Wait for me.

53:02.715 --> 53:04.134
I will return.

53:05.635 --> 53:07.679
I will see you in time".

53:13.476 --> 53:15.103
And that was it.

53:18.982 --> 53:20.441
It's a little...

53:26.781 --> 53:28.825
Have a look.

54:08.531 --> 54:09.991
She knew.

54:12.285 --> 54:13.745
I didn't see anything.

54:33.598 --> 54:37.143
You want to hear
the chief's latest phone call?

55:06.714 --> 55:07.966
Yes?

55:08.049 --> 55:09.759
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?

55:09.760 --> 55:13.054
I know I sounded crazy the other day,
but things are getting weird out here.

55:13.138 --> 55:14.430
Slow down, Gordon.

55:14.514 --> 55:15.932
- He's here.
- Who's here?

55:16.015 --> 55:19.602
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.

55:19.686 --> 55:23.148
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.

55:24.399 --> 55:27.610
Gordon, let me talk to him.

55:28.903 --> 55:30.989
Sure. Hang on.

55:32.323 --> 55:33.783
Hello, John Klein.

55:35.535 --> 55:37.537
Who is this?

55:37.620 --> 55:40.165
My name is Indrid Cold.

55:44.586 --> 55:46.546
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

55:46.629 --> 55:51.009
Your father was born
in Racine, Wisconsin.

55:51.092 --> 55:54.053
He lived in a green house
on Monroe Street.

55:55.972 --> 55:58.892
You don't remember
how your mother looked.

56:01.102 --> 56:03.021
Okay, you got my attention.

56:11.529 --> 56:13.823
- Where's my watch?
- In your shoe.

56:15.742 --> 56:16.993
Under the bed.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.687
Very good, John.
Thank you.

56:46.773 --> 56:49.108
What's in my hand?

56:50.735 --> 56:52.028
Chap Stick.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.786
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

56:59.869 --> 57:01.412
Did you read my mind?

57:01.496 --> 57:04.582
I have no need to, do I?

57:08.586 --> 57:12.090
What's the third line of page 51?

57:13.925 --> 57:18.346
"A broken smile
beneath her whispered wings".

57:20.223 --> 57:22.308
Still more proof, John Klein?

57:28.231 --> 57:30.275
What do you look like?

57:30.358 --> 57:33.570
It depends on who's looking.

57:35.780 --> 57:38.241
I want to meet you.

57:38.283 --> 57:40.743
You already have, John.

57:40.827 --> 57:43.580
I have seen you afraid.

57:43.705 --> 57:46.082
You're afraid right now, aren't you?

57:48.751 --> 57:51.713
Can I ask you something?

57:52.839 --> 57:55.758
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

58:03.308 --> 58:05.226
What happened to my wife?

58:06.352 --> 58:07.604
You were there.

58:09.230 --> 58:12.817
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.

58:12.901 --> 58:15.278
You will see her in time.

58:39.135 --> 58:41.346
What's up, Connie?

58:41.429 --> 58:43.556
Everything okay?

58:44.849 --> 58:46.851
Did you just call John?

58:48.144 --> 58:50.104
I've been asleep since 9:00.

59:03.368 --> 59:06.538
Unless, of course,
you're Gordon Smallwood.

59:06.621 --> 59:11.376
See? It's sticking up here
around 1,950 cycles per second.

59:11.417 --> 59:16.005
But it never gets any lower
than maybe 1,930 or so.

59:17.048 --> 59:20.009
But yours is way down here
in the normal vocal range...

59:20.093 --> 59:23.721
anywhere between 1,000
and 1,200 cycles per second.

59:23.847 --> 59:27.267
Okay, so this guy's vocal range
is much higher than mine.

59:28.309 --> 59:30.895
What makes you think it's a man?

59:30.979 --> 59:32.730
Still more proof, John Klein?

59:40.405 --> 59:41.990
What is it?

59:42.866 --> 59:45.618
Near as I can tell, it's...

59:45.660 --> 59:47.036
an electrical impulse.

59:51.249 --> 59:54.461
But whatever it is, it's not
coming from human vocal cords.

59:54.502 --> 59:57.046
Why ask me
what you already know, John?

59:57.172 --> 59:58.882
What happened to my wife?

01:00:00.717 --> 01:00:02.135
You were there.

01:00:03.511 --> 01:00:06.681
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.

01:00:06.764 --> 01:00:09.184
You will see her in time.

01:00:13.688 --> 01:00:18.151
This isn't like you. We used to rip on
this stuff, when it came over the wire.

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:19.319
Yeah, I know.

01:00:19.402 --> 01:00:23.072
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.

01:00:23.156 --> 01:00:26.201
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu. Any excuse.

01:00:26.284 --> 01:00:27.660
I'll back you up.

01:00:27.702 --> 01:00:30.371
I just wanna make sure
you still got a job...

01:00:30.497 --> 01:00:34.000
when you're done doing
whatever it is you're doing down there.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.085
Okay, I'll call you from Chicago.

01:00:40.173 --> 01:00:41.424
What time is your flight?

01:00:43.676 --> 01:00:45.136
8:00 a.m.

01:00:49.224 --> 01:00:50.475
Am I crazy?

01:00:54.312 --> 01:00:55.396
No.

01:00:59.776 --> 01:01:01.444
I am crazy.

01:01:43.987 --> 01:01:45.989
Alexander Leek.

01:01:48.616 --> 01:01:52.036
- Who the hell are you?
- John Klein. I called you last week.

01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:55.248
Do you know what that is?

01:01:57.792 --> 01:01:59.210
Stay away.

01:02:01.296 --> 01:02:04.257
I need to know what this is.
Tell me.

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:09.471
Where are they seeing it?

01:02:09.512 --> 01:02:11.473
Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:16.853
You can help me.

01:02:19.898 --> 01:02:21.316
Follow me.

01:02:27.947 --> 01:02:30.325
The nocturnal butterfly.

01:02:30.408 --> 01:02:34.579
In ancient cultures, the moth
represents a form of the psyche...

01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:37.415
or the soul immortally trapped...

01:02:37.457 --> 01:02:41.044
in the hellish death realms.

01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:44.464
Mothman.

01:02:46.758 --> 01:02:50.678
That's what the Ukrainians called him.
Rough translation, of course.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.974
There were 100 sightings in Chernobyl
the year the nuclear plant went down.

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:58.311
Galveston, 1969,
just before the hurricane.

01:02:58.353 --> 01:02:59.813
They saw it.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.858
But seeing isn't always believing.

01:03:06.986 --> 01:03:09.906
Look, there's never been
a single shred of evidence...

01:03:09.989 --> 01:03:14.744
to show that these things
exist materially.

01:03:14.869 --> 01:03:17.622
So you're telling me
these things do not exist?

01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:22.502
Oh, they exist. All kinds of things
exist around us that we never see.

01:03:22.585 --> 01:03:26.339
Electricity, microwaves,
infrared waves.

01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:29.717
You know, these things
have been around forever.

01:03:29.801 --> 01:03:32.929
They show up in cave paintings.

01:03:33.012 --> 01:03:35.515
They're a normal condition
of the planet.

01:03:37.809 --> 01:03:41.938
They're just not part of our consensus
of what constitutes...

01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:45.108
physical reality.

01:03:45.191 --> 01:03:47.444
What are they part of, then?

01:03:49.362 --> 01:03:52.323
You're asking for an explanation...

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:53.867
for something...

01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:59.497
that can't be explained rationally.

01:04:05.795 --> 01:04:08.840
You know the buildup of energy
before something happens?

01:04:09.632 --> 01:04:12.385
The way your hair stands up
before lightning strikes?

01:04:12.427 --> 01:04:16.723
"Before something happens".
Do you mean they cause disasters?

01:04:17.557 --> 01:04:19.392
Why would they need to?

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.187
All right, then...

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:24.272
are they trying to warn me?

01:04:27.776 --> 01:04:29.527
Their motivations...

01:04:31.112 --> 01:04:32.530
aren't human.

01:04:35.533 --> 01:04:37.869
All right, then what do they want?

01:04:37.952 --> 01:04:39.871
I have no idea.

01:04:41.331 --> 01:04:43.374
What you really want is to know...

01:04:45.126 --> 01:04:46.544
why you?

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.298
Yes.

01:04:52.425 --> 01:04:56.012
You noticed them,
and they noticed that you noticed them.

01:04:58.181 --> 01:05:01.518
Most people aren't sensitive enough
to see them...

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.229
without some kind of...

01:05:06.815 --> 01:05:08.358
trauma.

01:05:10.985 --> 01:05:13.196
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.954
Last week my friend
got a strange phone call...

01:05:21.037 --> 01:05:23.164
from an entity...

01:05:24.415 --> 01:05:26.000
a spirit, whatever.

01:05:27.877 --> 01:05:29.921
It seemed to know everything.

01:05:30.046 --> 01:05:31.464
Like God?

01:05:31.548 --> 01:05:34.801
- It made predictions that came true?
- Yes.

01:05:34.884 --> 01:05:37.303
His name was Indrid Cold.

01:05:37.387 --> 01:05:41.516
It's perception, John.
They appear differently to everyone.

01:05:41.558 --> 01:05:44.811
A voice, a light, a man, a monster.

01:05:44.894 --> 01:05:49.566
If your friend thinks it's God he spoke
to, he's off by more than a few degrees.

01:05:49.649 --> 01:05:52.068
Then how do you explain
that it knows everything?

01:05:53.945 --> 01:05:55.196
Look at that.

01:05:56.114 --> 01:06:00.910
If there was a car crash 10 blocks away,
that window washer could likely see it.

01:06:00.994 --> 01:06:03.955
That doesn't mean he's God...

01:06:04.038 --> 01:06:05.957
or even smarter than we are.

01:06:07.292 --> 01:06:10.086
But from where he's sitting...

01:06:10.128 --> 01:06:13.089
he can see
a little further down the road.

01:06:14.215 --> 01:06:16.968
I think we can assume that...

01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:18.970
these entities
are more advanced than us.

01:06:19.053 --> 01:06:23.641
Why don't they just come right out
and tell us what's on their minds?

01:06:23.725 --> 01:06:25.727
You're more advanced than a cockroach.

01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:28.730
Have you ever tried explaining yourself
to one of them?

01:06:33.276 --> 01:06:35.945
How many people have seen it?

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:37.989
Ten. Twenty, maybe.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.581
Listen to me. Something terrible
is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:49.751
Don't go back.

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:52.670
Stay away.

01:06:55.006 --> 01:06:57.050
I can't talk about this anymore.

01:07:07.685 --> 01:07:09.646
There is a reason...

01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:11.815
that I ended up in Point Pleasant.

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:15.652
Something brought me there.

01:07:15.777 --> 01:07:17.779
Whatever brought you there...

01:07:19.364 --> 01:07:21.282
brought you there to die.

01:08:05.535 --> 01:08:08.830
You're just in time. They're just
about to light this Christmas tree.

01:08:08.913 --> 01:08:11.332
They have been for the last two hours.

01:08:12.667 --> 01:08:14.711
Isn't that Denise?

01:08:14.794 --> 01:08:16.754
Is she okay?

01:08:16.837 --> 01:08:18.256
She left Gordon.

01:08:19.799 --> 01:08:22.801
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:23.845
Shit.

01:08:25.263 --> 01:08:28.057
- Where is he?
- Who knows?

01:08:31.102 --> 01:08:33.354
Be back in a second.

01:08:37.317 --> 01:08:39.319
Connie.

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.779
What's wrong?

01:08:42.447 --> 01:08:45.408
Fifteen more people
reported seeing that thing today.

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:47.702
Fifteen.
Three of them were cops.

01:08:50.371 --> 01:08:53.416
I hate this, John.
I absolutely goddamn hate this.

01:09:00.548 --> 01:09:02.466
How was Chicago?

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.971
What did he say?

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:11.975
He wouldn't see me.

01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:32.330
Shit.

01:09:57.772 --> 01:09:59.232
You all right?

01:10:06.322 --> 01:10:08.867
It's cold.
Get in the car, warm up.

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:11.453
I can't.
I'm waiting for him.

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:20.837
Everybody in this town is looking at me
like I'm insane. You know why?

01:10:23.882 --> 01:10:28.636
Denise and all the others,
they don't know, John.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.180
I do.

01:10:34.767 --> 01:10:36.686
I don't think you're crazy.

01:10:36.769 --> 01:10:38.396
Okay?

01:10:38.438 --> 01:10:40.857
You talked to him too, John.

01:10:44.736 --> 01:10:46.196
You know...

01:10:46.237 --> 01:10:49.157
I've been lying awake at night.

01:10:50.408 --> 01:10:51.868
I feel...

01:10:53.411 --> 01:10:55.038
like I'm sleeping...

01:10:56.122 --> 01:10:57.582
but I'm awake.

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.004
That's when I hear him.

01:11:03.129 --> 01:11:05.548
And lately, when I hear him...

01:11:06.966 --> 01:11:08.426
all at once...

01:11:11.304 --> 01:11:12.889
I understand.

01:11:16.935 --> 01:11:18.353
Everything.

01:11:22.607 --> 01:11:27.195
John, do you remember
the last time you were happy?

01:11:42.794 --> 01:11:44.254
It's real.

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.300
These things are real.

01:12:19.038 --> 01:12:21.124
I want you to be happy.

01:12:31.843 --> 01:12:33.303
Yeah?

01:12:35.972 --> 01:12:37.557
What?

01:12:37.599 --> 01:12:40.560
This is your wake-up call,
Mr. Klein.

01:12:40.643 --> 01:12:43.062
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.

01:13:28.191 --> 01:13:31.152
What happened to you, Mr. Klein?

01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:43.039
I can't believe I got through.

01:13:44.207 --> 01:13:46.209
Gordon, where are you, man?

01:13:46.251 --> 01:13:47.752
Speak up.

01:13:47.836 --> 01:13:50.588
Listen, John, he was right.

01:13:50.672 --> 01:13:53.007
Mr. Cold was right
about everything.

01:13:53.091 --> 01:13:56.386
Right? Right about what?
I can't hear you.

01:13:56.427 --> 01:13:58.346
He was right about understanding.

01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:02.225
It's real, John.
I want you to know.

01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:05.520
- It's real.
- What is... What are you talking about?

01:14:05.562 --> 01:14:08.898
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:10.900
I'll see you in time.

01:14:37.677 --> 01:14:38.970
Gordon?

01:16:14.607 --> 01:16:17.026
Can they tell how long
he was out there?

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.363
Looks like he's been dead
about eight hours.

01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:23.741
He died of exposure.

01:16:25.702 --> 01:16:27.912
What made you come out here?

01:16:32.792 --> 01:16:35.086
- He called me.
- When?

01:16:35.879 --> 01:16:37.839
I didn't like the way he sounded.

01:16:37.964 --> 01:16:40.383
When did he call you, John?

01:16:45.513 --> 01:16:46.973
About an hour ago.

01:16:49.642 --> 01:16:51.060
I can't stand this.

01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:40.485
It didn't seem right
to bring this up at the funeral...

01:17:40.568 --> 01:17:43.947
but as far as I know there's never been
any accidents at the chemical plant.

01:17:44.823 --> 01:17:46.699
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:46.783 --> 01:17:51.788
I got your message the other day.
I meant to call you back, but I forgot.

01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:56.793
Don't you remember
leaving me that message?

01:17:56.876 --> 01:17:59.420
Chief, this is John Klein.

01:17:59.504 --> 01:18:01.714
I didn't call him.
No, it's not me.

01:18:01.756 --> 01:18:04.592
I analyzed both tapes
with the voice print.

01:18:04.676 --> 01:18:08.096
I don't care.
It may be my voice. It's not me.

01:18:08.179 --> 01:18:10.557
- It is not me.
- Listen to me.

01:18:10.598 --> 01:18:14.102
I would swear in a court of law
that that's your voice.

01:18:14.185 --> 01:18:16.229
Yeah, great. Thanks.

01:18:17.939 --> 01:18:18.857
Shit!

01:18:48.136 --> 01:18:50.305
Regular coffee to go, please.

01:18:51.097 --> 01:18:52.140
Seventy-five cents.

01:18:55.226 --> 01:18:57.187
Have a great day.

01:19:07.447 --> 01:19:08.865
Do you know that woman?

01:19:10.325 --> 01:19:13.328
- What woman?
- She just left. You didn't see her?

01:19:13.411 --> 01:19:15.370
- No.
- That's strange.

01:19:15.371 --> 01:19:19.876
She had long red hair, green eyes, real
pretty, and she was asking about you.

01:19:36.309 --> 01:19:38.895
- Did you see which way she went?
- No.

01:19:40.146 --> 01:19:43.691
- What did she say?
- She asked a lot of strange questions.

01:19:43.775 --> 01:19:47.237
What are you doing here?
And she asked if you were happy.

01:19:49.405 --> 01:19:52.408
- What did you say?
- I asked her for some ID.

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.910
- Did she give you any?
- No.

01:19:53.993 --> 01:19:58.414
She just said "Tell John I'm sorry for
ruining everything", and then she left.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:02.043
What's wrong?

01:20:06.631 --> 01:20:07.549
Was it her?

01:20:08.508 --> 01:20:09.467
Was it her?

01:20:12.512 --> 01:20:13.888
That's your wife?

01:20:14.556 --> 01:20:15.974
It was her.

01:20:17.183 --> 01:20:19.561
- I'm not sure.
- What?

01:20:19.602 --> 01:20:21.271
I mean, the hair is different.

01:20:21.354 --> 01:20:23.565
- Oh, come on!
- What?

01:20:23.648 --> 01:20:27.152
- This is the woman you saw.
- No, it isn't, John.

01:20:27.235 --> 01:20:29.779
Now, I agree there is a similarity...

01:20:29.904 --> 01:20:31.156
Bullshit!

01:20:36.828 --> 01:20:38.413
John, it's all right.

01:20:38.455 --> 01:20:40.415
I'm not all right.

01:20:42.959 --> 01:20:46.379
This is the woman you saw.
She was here. This woman.

01:20:51.092 --> 01:20:53.011
Don't you do this to me.

01:21:46.564 --> 01:21:48.483
I'm sorry, John.

01:21:48.525 --> 01:21:50.985
I feel like I've ruined everything.

01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:52.821
I feel like I've ruined everything.

01:21:58.952 --> 01:22:00.328
I'm so sorry.

01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:39.284
I need to know what happened to you.

01:22:40.702 --> 01:22:43.079
Please.

01:22:43.163 --> 01:22:44.622
Come in.

01:22:50.086 --> 01:22:54.007
I was a physics professor at Cornell.

01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:56.801
Tenured.
You can look me up.

01:22:57.886 --> 01:23:00.680
One day I started hearing voices.

01:23:02.348 --> 01:23:05.101
The voices became messages.

01:23:05.143 --> 01:23:08.229
Before long, I was fully convinced
that I was receiving...

01:23:08.313 --> 01:23:12.192
predictions of disaster
from outside intelligences.

01:23:12.233 --> 01:23:13.735
But you were, weren't you?

01:23:13.818 --> 01:23:16.237
John, I had tapes of their voices.

01:23:17.655 --> 01:23:21.075
I knew a building was going to blow up,
and I tried to prevent it...

01:23:21.201 --> 01:23:24.370
but no one listened.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.874
What happened?

01:23:27.916 --> 01:23:29.292
People died.

01:23:33.254 --> 01:23:35.256
Many people died.

01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:40.720
I was investigated, almost arrested.

01:23:42.347 --> 01:23:44.265
My wife divorced me.

01:23:45.558 --> 01:23:47.769
My kids...

01:23:47.852 --> 01:23:50.063
stopped speaking to me.

01:23:54.442 --> 01:23:58.154
Do you know what four years in
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?

01:24:00.198 --> 01:24:02.075
Everything...

01:24:02.158 --> 01:24:03.993
gone.

01:24:05.286 --> 01:24:08.540
Oh, you'll never understand
their messages.

01:24:08.623 --> 01:24:10.834
You'll misinterpret them.

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:13.586
I did.
It almost destroyed me.

01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:16.798
In the end,
it all came down to just...

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.925
one simple question.

01:24:19.717 --> 01:24:22.262
Which was more important...

01:24:22.345 --> 01:24:24.347
having proof...

01:24:26.433 --> 01:24:28.351
or being alive?

01:24:32.439 --> 01:24:33.606
Trust me.

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:36.484
I turned away years ago...

01:24:36.568 --> 01:24:38.820
and I've never looked back.

01:24:41.948 --> 01:24:44.325
Didn't you need to know?

01:24:49.956 --> 01:24:52.125
We're not allowed to know.

01:26:34.769 --> 01:26:37.230
It's me, Cyrus.

01:26:37.272 --> 01:26:39.274
John, is that you?

01:26:39.399 --> 01:26:40.984
Yeah.

01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:42.152
Yeah, it's me.

01:26:42.277 --> 01:26:44.612
Whatever you are doing, you drop it.

01:26:44.654 --> 01:26:46.614
Governor McCallum
is going to Charleston.

01:26:46.656 --> 01:26:49.617
Then he's touring that chemical plant
in Point Pleasant today.

01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:52.495
Now, I want you to go down there...

01:26:52.579 --> 01:26:54.789
and meet him at the airport.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:59.169
You listening?

01:26:59.252 --> 01:27:01.754
Yeah, McCal I...
at the chemical plant. Got it.

01:27:01.838 --> 01:27:04.674
I need to know that
you're gonna be there.

01:27:04.757 --> 01:27:06.676
John, are you there?

01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:24.611
Ohio.

01:27:24.694 --> 01:27:29.491
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

01:27:30.909 --> 01:27:35.872
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

01:27:41.336 --> 01:27:44.631
I can't call in sick just because
you have a bad feeling about today.

01:27:44.756 --> 01:27:48.718
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.

01:27:48.843 --> 01:27:50.762
They show up over the chemical plant.

01:27:50.845 --> 01:27:53.014
Josh gets a call from me,
but it's not really me.

01:27:53.098 --> 01:27:57.477
I'm talking about something bad
happening at the chemical plant.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.480
Then I get this message
from this Indrid Cold...

01:28:00.563 --> 01:28:04.192
who's talking about
a great tragedy on the Ohio River.

01:28:05.276 --> 01:28:07.654
Guess what's on the Ohio River.

01:28:07.737 --> 01:28:09.280
The chemical plant.

01:28:10.573 --> 01:28:13.743
Today Governor McCallum
is gonna be there.

01:28:13.827 --> 01:28:16.579
I was on my way to interview him.
That's how I ended...

01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:23.711
That's how I ended up here.

01:28:27.215 --> 01:28:28.925
My God.

01:28:29.008 --> 01:28:31.052
That's why I'm here.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.222
He was right.

01:28:34.931 --> 01:28:36.891
Who was right?

01:28:39.352 --> 01:28:41.479
You saw Leek.

01:28:41.563 --> 01:28:43.648
- He was part of the warning.
- What?

01:28:43.731 --> 01:28:46.818
He was part of the warning.
Stop, stop, stop.

01:28:46.901 --> 01:28:49.195
I didn't want to scare you.

01:28:51.698 --> 01:28:53.074
He said...

01:28:54.242 --> 01:28:56.202
He said the messages are real.

01:28:57.996 --> 01:29:00.248
Something terrible is gonna happen.

01:29:02.542 --> 01:29:03.960
Connie, please.

01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:09.257
We have to leave here now.

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.301
I will not live my life like that.

01:29:11.342 --> 01:29:15.722
I will not make decisions based
on messages from Indrid Cold.

01:29:15.764 --> 01:29:17.640
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.

01:29:20.268 --> 01:29:22.228
Okay, I'm going to Charleston.

01:29:22.312 --> 01:29:24.272
I'll be at the Marriott.
Get yourself reassigned.

01:29:24.355 --> 01:29:26.274
I don't want you anywhere
near the plant today.

01:29:26.357 --> 01:29:27.817
What if nothing happens?

01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:33.072
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?

01:29:33.156 --> 01:29:35.283
- That's not the point.
- Well, I think it is the point.

01:29:35.366 --> 01:29:38.661
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!

01:29:40.705 --> 01:29:43.291
I know what's gonna happen.

01:29:45.502 --> 01:29:47.879
You have to leave now.

01:29:47.962 --> 01:29:51.674
I have to report to work.
We can talk about this later.

01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:28.503
- Governor?
- Good to see you, John.

01:30:28.586 --> 01:30:30.964
I need to speak with you.
It's urgent.

01:30:31.047 --> 01:30:33.424
- What's this about, John?
- It's the tour.

01:30:33.508 --> 01:30:35.176
You can't do it. You can't go.

01:30:36.219 --> 01:30:39.264
Listen to me.
Cancel it. Cancel the tour.

01:30:39.347 --> 01:30:42.809
Cancel it. Make them
shut down the plant now.

01:30:42.892 --> 01:30:44.811
The plant's gonna blow up
while you're there.

01:30:46.062 --> 01:30:48.731
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?

01:30:48.815 --> 01:30:50.900
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.

01:30:50.984 --> 01:30:53.236
Have you received a bomb threat?

01:30:53.319 --> 01:30:56.531
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.

01:30:56.573 --> 01:31:00.034
- I know this sounds...
- You're messing up here, John.

01:31:03.788 --> 01:31:06.583
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.

01:31:16.676 --> 01:31:19.763
Our top story takes us tonight
to Point Pleasant...

01:31:19.846 --> 01:31:22.766
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!

01:31:22.849 --> 01:31:24.934
...toured the Edgewater
Petrochemical plant.

01:31:25.018 --> 01:31:27.353
In what he's called
a successful review...

01:31:27.437 --> 01:31:31.024
Governor McCallum has given
high marks to this petrochemical plant.

01:31:31.107 --> 01:31:33.985
He is expected to call
for similar renovations...

01:31:34.068 --> 01:31:36.196
at several Virginia plants.

01:31:36.279 --> 01:31:38.615
WOWK-TV 13...

01:31:38.698 --> 01:31:42.243
has an exclusive look inside
at what the governor saw.

01:31:42.368 --> 01:31:43.703
Son of a bitch.

01:31:43.787 --> 01:31:47.207
I congratulate my friends
at Edgewater Petrochemical...

01:31:47.248 --> 01:31:49.584
on a job well done.

01:31:50.794 --> 01:31:52.420
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
- Excuse me, Mr. Klein.

01:31:52.462 --> 01:31:54.422
You have a message.

01:32:21.658 --> 01:32:23.076
Come in.

01:32:33.962 --> 01:32:35.922
- Back to Washington?
- Yeah.

01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:39.259
- Do you have to go?
- I have to go.

01:32:41.845 --> 01:32:44.973
- If this is about today...
- No, it's not.

01:32:46.516 --> 01:32:48.435
I got a message.

01:32:50.061 --> 01:32:52.522
I have to go home.

01:32:52.605 --> 01:32:55.692
I have to be there noon on Friday.

01:32:55.733 --> 01:32:57.986
John, do you realize
what's happening to you?

01:33:02.907 --> 01:33:05.034
I have to go.

01:34:29.536 --> 01:34:31.454
Hey, it's me.

01:34:33.081 --> 01:34:35.041
- Connie?
- Yeah.

01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:38.837
I thought we could chat
for, say, 10 or 15 minutes.

01:34:44.968 --> 01:34:47.971
- I'm sorry. Can I call you back?
- No, you can't.

01:34:49.139 --> 01:34:51.891
- I booked you a flight.
- What?

01:34:51.975 --> 01:34:54.936
It leaves Dulles
for Columbus, Ohio at 1:45.

01:34:57.272 --> 01:35:01.568
I tried to get you on the one to
Charleston, but they're all booked up.

01:35:01.651 --> 01:35:04.154
So if you leave now,
you'll just make it.

01:35:04.237 --> 01:35:05.947
I can't.

01:35:08.867 --> 01:35:11.411
It's Christmas Eve, John.

01:35:11.494 --> 01:35:13.455
You shouldn't be alone.

01:35:18.126 --> 01:35:19.294
I can't.

01:35:19.377 --> 01:35:21.296
Yeah, you can.

01:35:23.298 --> 01:35:24.757
You know...

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.553
when Mary got sick...

01:35:28.636 --> 01:35:30.805
I couldn't help thinking...

01:35:30.889 --> 01:35:32.766
this isn't real.

01:35:33.892 --> 01:35:36.144
I can stop this.

01:35:36.227 --> 01:35:38.605
I know I can.
I can stop this.

01:35:39.606 --> 01:35:42.066
No one can stop it, John.

01:35:43.151 --> 01:35:45.069
Listen to me.

01:35:46.154 --> 01:35:49.908
Planes are going to crash.
Earthquakes are going to happen.

01:35:49.991 --> 01:35:52.327
People you know and love
are going to die...

01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:55.747
and no matter what
that voice tells you...

01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:59.125
there's nothing you can do about it.

01:36:01.377 --> 01:36:03.922
It's two years to the day.

01:36:05.006 --> 01:36:09.135
He told me that she's going to call.
He said that Mary's going to call.

01:36:09.219 --> 01:36:10.428
He's lying.

01:36:12.639 --> 01:36:15.809
Whoever calls may sound like her...

01:36:15.892 --> 01:36:18.019
but it's not gonna be her.

01:36:19.104 --> 01:36:21.689
I don't know what happens to us
after we die...

01:36:21.773 --> 01:36:24.400
but I'll bet you
wherever Mary is now...

01:36:24.484 --> 01:36:27.070
she's nowhere near Indrid Cold.

01:36:29.364 --> 01:36:31.282
What if it is her?

01:36:36.663 --> 01:36:38.581
She's dead, John.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:44.838
The only important question now is
how do you want to remember her?

01:36:49.592 --> 01:36:51.177
I miss her so much.

01:36:51.261 --> 01:36:54.013
I know you do.
Of course you do.

01:36:54.055 --> 01:36:56.015
But, John, listen...

01:36:57.142 --> 01:37:00.145
you can miss her here
just as easily as there.

01:37:00.228 --> 01:37:03.565
Even more easily because there,
you're all alone.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.403
And that's just no way to be.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.701
You do whatever you need to do...

01:37:14.784 --> 01:37:16.703
and I'll understand.

01:37:18.163 --> 01:37:21.166
But here,
we have dinner at 6:00...

01:37:22.375 --> 01:37:24.627
and we open presents at 8:00.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.840
And we hope we see you.

01:37:31.301 --> 01:37:32.719
Okay?

01:37:37.766 --> 01:37:39.225
Bye, John.

01:39:58.198 --> 01:40:01.701
WJMP time is 5:51
on this chilly Christmas Eve.

01:40:35.819 --> 01:40:37.570
Come on.

01:41:03.179 --> 01:41:07.725
- You know what's going on down there?
- Some problem with the traffic lights.

01:41:07.809 --> 01:41:09.269
Shit.

01:41:51.186 --> 01:41:54.814
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.037
My God...

01:42:52.622 --> 01:42:55.166
Get off the bridge!
Everyone's gotta get off the bridge!

01:43:00.463 --> 01:43:03.007
Get off! Everyone get out
of your cars and get off!

01:43:04.676 --> 01:43:06.886
C.J., come on!

01:43:06.970 --> 01:43:09.264
You've gotta get off.
Turn the damn thing down.

01:43:09.305 --> 01:43:11.474
- What?
- You gotta get off the bridge now!

01:43:41.463 --> 01:43:44.507
- Get out! Get out!
- Let's go!

01:43:58.104 --> 01:44:01.316
Get off!
Get off the bridge!

01:44:03.443 --> 01:44:05.069
Oh, God!

01:44:13.119 --> 01:44:14.412
Go!

01:44:19.042 --> 01:44:21.336
Get out of the car!
Get off the bridge!

01:44:22.921 --> 01:44:24.672
Quick!

01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.015
Let's get out!

01:44:42.232 --> 01:44:44.067
Get out!

01:44:59.707 --> 01:45:00.750
Get out!

01:45:04.045 --> 01:45:06.506
Come on. Get out.

01:45:07.382 --> 01:45:09.801
All units, this is unit 64.

01:45:20.979 --> 01:45:22.814
Get out!

01:45:32.323 --> 01:45:33.992
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge.

01:46:02.228 --> 01:46:04.147
Rose, do you copy?

01:46:07.108 --> 01:46:10.445
Signal 33 on the Silver Bridge...

01:48:42.305 --> 01:48:44.307
Wake up. Wake up.

01:48:51.523 --> 01:48:53.775
Here we go.

01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:41.299
You are here.

01:50:42.717 --> 01:50:45.053
I didn't know if I was dreaming or...

01:50:45.136 --> 01:50:47.263
I left DC right after you called.

01:50:49.641 --> 01:50:51.392
You did call me, right?

01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:55.480
Yeah.

01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:58.483
Yeah, I called.

01:51:03.905 --> 01:51:06.324
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

01:51:07.951 --> 01:51:10.703
But I supposed
it could've been a lot worse.

01:51:13.248 --> 01:51:16.209
Are they done with the search?

01:51:16.292 --> 01:51:17.877
Thirty-six.

01:51:20.088 --> 01:51:22.549
Looks like about 36 people.

01:51:23.675 --> 01:51:24.759
Jesus.

01:51:35.478 --> 01:51:36.896
Thirty-six?

01:51:40.066 --> 01:51:41.484
Thirty-six?

01:51:49.284 --> 01:51:51.578
Wake up, number 37.
