WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.503
[knocks]

00:05.672 --> 00:06.673
[colonel] Enter.

00:09.092 --> 00:09.927
[door closes]

00:15.891 --> 00:18.519
Lieutenant Shaw reporting as ordered, sir.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.233
[colonel] At ease.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.570
Oh.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.031
I believe that's gonna stick around awhile.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.286
You know, this island is lousy
with sailors, Marines.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.498
You couldn't pick a fight with one of them
instead of two of our own?

00:40.958 --> 00:42.459
[both grunt]

00:42.459 --> 00:45.254
Sometimes the fight picks you, sir.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.797
[colonel] What was the fight even about?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.678
I guess I just can't abide bullies, sir.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.430
[colonel] You know, your father
threw a few punches in his day.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.766
Some of them at me.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.059
[chuckles]

00:59.059 --> 01:03.397
- What do you think he'd make of you now?
- [grunting, groaning]

01:03.397 --> 01:04.313
[Lee] <i>I don't know, sir.</i>

01:05.274 --> 01:07.276
Maybe we could sober him up and ask him.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.905
All right.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.991
Well, some orders have come through.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.536
Security escort for a Japanese scientist.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.122
[stammers] Sorry, sir.
A Japanese scientist?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.748
[colonel] This isn't a milk run, Lieutenant.

01:21.748 --> 01:25.043
We already lost a man
on one of these escort missions

01:25.043 --> 01:26.170
a couple of months back.

01:27.671 --> 01:31.175
You will protect, observe, and report
when and if able. Understood?

01:31.175 --> 01:32.426
Understood, sir.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.636
Then that is all, Lieutenant.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.931
Dismissed.

01:51.278 --> 01:55.324
Excuse me, sir, uh, you don't happen to be
Dr. Miura, would--

01:55.324 --> 01:57.201
[speaks Japanese]

01:57.826 --> 01:58.660
Miura?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.704
- [speaks Japanese]
- Oh, sorry.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.290
I think you're here for me.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.961
[chuckles] Wish I could say I was,
but I'm here on army business.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.507
Maybe we can get a drink
on my way out, huh?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.759
[chuckles] Wait a minute.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.221
They told me they were sending
a military escort,

02:17.221 --> 02:19.389
and you're the only one here in uniform.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.601
Um...

02:24.061 --> 02:25.854
I'm-- I'm supposed to meet a Dr. Miura.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.105
I'm Keiko Miura.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.234
- You're-- Keiko, nice to meet you.
- [chuckles] Nice to meet you.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.318
You must be his daughter?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.446
Or--

02:34.446 --> 02:37.950
I'm sorry. I think there's
a little miscommunication happening here.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.826
- Um, let's start over.
- Yes, why don't we?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.203
- Okay.
- You are...

02:41.203 --> 02:44.665
I am Lieutenant Leland Lafayette Shaw III,
but you can call me Lee.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.503
I'm Keiko Miura,
and you may call me Dr. Miura.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.140
[Lee] You know, these things
aren't supposed to go that fast.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.309
[engine revs]

03:05.602 --> 03:06.812
Would you like me to drive?

03:06.812 --> 03:07.896
Why?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.148
Am I making you nervous?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.860
Nope. But, uh,

03:14.111 --> 03:16.280
I've been assigned to you
as your military escort.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.908
This is an army jeep
and I'm, you know, the army.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.077
I've been driving up and down these roads
for weeks.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.161
I know the way.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.246
[engine revs]

03:25.747 --> 03:26.790
[Lee] Okay then.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.293
I'm starting to get the feeling
you don't really want me around here.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.422
Aren't you even curious why you're here?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.506
Very much so.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.303
[sighs] A WB-29
on a routine weather mission

03:39.303 --> 03:42.306
scooped up some airborne radioisotopes
over the Philippine Sea.

03:43.307 --> 03:47.102
That's-- That's pretty far south
for a Russian bomb test. They don't--

03:47.102 --> 03:49.062
That's because it's not the Russians.

03:50.606 --> 03:54.193
Well, it's not us. So, who is it?

03:54.193 --> 03:56.570
Well, they were the wrong isotopes
for bomb fallout.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.616
And meteorological data
shows they likely originated here.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.700
The Philippines?

04:02.534 --> 04:03.535
That's gotta be a mistake.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.996
That's what I'm here to find out.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.457
Okay.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.002
We should get to work. Hit the gas, Doc.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.865
[alarm ringing]

06:09.036 --> 06:10.037
[alarm stops]

06:13.498 --> 06:14.750
[exhales sharply]

06:17.377 --> 06:18.378
[sighs]

06:26.011 --> 06:27.012
[sighs]

07:39.793 --> 07:41.378
[screams]

07:43.338 --> 07:44.464
[screams]

07:45.132 --> 07:46.133
[grunts]

09:17.224 --> 09:18.392
[grunts]

09:18.392 --> 09:19.977
Every day the reading diminishes.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.105
Soon it'll be entirely gone,
and the trail will be lost.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.107
[Lee] Uh-huh. Got that. Double-time.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.984
- [sighs]
- Your English is very good.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.947
It came in handy when I did
my postgraduate work at Berkeley.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.576
It's impressive.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.996
But, uh, doesn't that make you
a little overqualified

09:38.996 --> 09:40.163
for this snipe hunt?

09:40.163 --> 09:41.665
[Keiko chuckles] This what?

09:41.665 --> 09:43.292
Wild-goose chase.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.297
Come on, Doc. Don't you think
if those readings were legit,

09:48.297 --> 09:50.507
Washington would've sent
half the eggheads at Los Alamos

09:50.507 --> 09:51.425
to check it out?

09:52.009 --> 09:54.595
Not a woman.
Certainly not a Japanese woman.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.013
Oh, you got that right. Yeah.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.435
You want me to lie
and pretend that's not the way things are?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.519
Mm-mmm.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.814
You're telling me
you didn't take one look at me

10:05.814 --> 10:09.151
and make a snap judgment
about who I am the second we met? Huh?

10:12.237 --> 10:15.741
It's not the same,
Leland Lafayette Shaw III.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.744
[sighs] Suppose it's not.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.625
Hmm.

10:25.834 --> 10:26.835
[grunts]

10:30.547 --> 10:31.673
[branch snaps]

10:38.472 --> 10:39.973
[rustling]

10:41.725 --> 10:42.726
Do you hear that?

10:45.145 --> 10:48.065
[branches snapping]

10:50.025 --> 10:51.026
Lieutenant?

10:55.739 --> 10:58.408
- [branches snap]
- [footsteps approaching]

10:58.408 --> 10:59.826
Lieutenant? [sighs]

11:03.580 --> 11:06.708
[person breathes heavily]

11:08.836 --> 11:09.837
Oh.

11:12.631 --> 11:13.632
Hey.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.593
Hey.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.678
[Lee] Don't move.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.846
- Whoa.
- [Keiko] Lieutenant.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.347
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Don't shoot.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.516
I'm American. Navy vet.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.561
And what are you doing here,
American Navy vet, huh? You filming us?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.146
Why? You guys doing something film worthy?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.440
- I asked you a question.
- I'm just asking a question back.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.692
Well, I got the gun, swab,

11:31.692 --> 11:33.193
so who are you
and what are you doing here?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
- Lieutenant.
- My name's William Randa.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.741
Okay, Lieutenant Shaw?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.368
Mm-hmm.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.414
Look, I promise I won't shoot you
if you don't shoot me.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.082
Deal?

11:55.424 --> 11:56.425
All right.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.509
All right?

11:58.719 --> 12:00.762
Still haven't answered my question.
What are you doing here?

12:00.762 --> 12:01.680
[scoffs]

12:02.264 --> 12:07.186
Well, you could say
I'm on a hunting expedition.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.021
I'm a cryptozoologist.

12:09.021 --> 12:12.983
- You're a cryptozoo-- Uh, what?
- He studies animals that don't exist.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.568
Yeah.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.739
Atmospheric sampler? Spectrometer?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.158
- Hey, is this a radiation monitor here?
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.576
- [Lee] Easy.
- [Keiko] Don't touch that.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.411
Sorry. I just--
I've never seen one before.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.414
[chuckles] Just wanted to check it out.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.709
'Cause, uh, it seems like maybe
we're out here hunting for the same thing.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.879
And wh-what's that, Mr. Randa?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.381
The truth.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.253
[cell phone rings]

13:18.048 --> 13:19.675
[Caroline, on phone]
<i>Catey, where have you been?</i>

13:19.675 --> 13:20.676
I'm sorry. I, uh--

13:20.676 --> 13:22.261
[Caroline]
<i>I've been calling and calling you.</i>

13:22.261 --> 13:24.054
Mom, I'm fine. I'm coming home.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.807
[Caroline] <i>Already? What did you find out?</i>

13:26.807 --> 13:28.517
It doesn't have anything to do with us.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.769
[Caroline] <i>What does that mean?
What does it have to do--</i>

13:30.769 --> 13:32.646
What did it always have to do with, Mom?
Him.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.231
- [Caroline] <i>Catey.</i>
- [sighs]

13:34.231 --> 13:36.233
- We'll talk when I get home, okay?
- <i>Don't do this.</i>

13:36.233 --> 13:37.734
- Love you. Bye.
- <i>Catey, do not--</i>

13:44.616 --> 13:45.617
American?

13:47.536 --> 13:48.745
Excuse me?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.664
Sorry, I-- I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I just--

13:50.664 --> 13:52.165
I-- I overheard your accent.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.545
Sometimes this place can make you feel
like you're stranded on another planet.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.629
Glad I could help.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.306
- Where are you heading?
- Look, I don't mean to be rude,

14:07.306 --> 14:10.309
but I've made all the new friends
I can handle for one day, thanks.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.186
Yeah. Nah, nah. Hey, I totally get it.

14:12.186 --> 14:16.481
This young woman abroad
runs into a strange man

14:16.481 --> 14:17.566
at the train station.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.445
And next thing you know,
you're buried alive in a coffin somewhere.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.824
I can't imagine that that helped.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.620
Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Look, look, look.
Hey, I'm harmless.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.872
My name's Tim. [chuckles]

14:32.456 --> 14:34.499
They don't come much more harmless
than the "Tim" variety.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.584
Have a nice night, Tim.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.629
I need to talk to you about the files.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.715
I don't--

14:43.425 --> 14:44.426
What files?

14:44.426 --> 14:46.178
I work for Monarch.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.098
You're not in trouble.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.392
Not yet.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.645
Those files belong to us,

14:55.604 --> 14:58.106
and they are more important
than you could possibly imagine.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.111
I need to make a call.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.241
Okay. Let's make a call.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.426
All right. All right.

15:27.261 --> 15:28.512
Make your call.

15:30.264 --> 15:31.265
Speaker, please.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.142
Sure. [sighs]

15:34.142 --> 15:35.227
[line rings]

15:35.227 --> 15:37.145
- [Caroline, on phone] <i>Cate? Hello? Cate?</i>
- [grunts]

15:37.145 --> 15:38.730
[groans]

15:38.730 --> 15:39.815

15:43.527 --> 15:44.987
[grunting] No.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.321
No. [grunting]

15:49.741 --> 15:52.494
[breathes heavily]
I said you weren't in trouble.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.788
-"Yet". You said "yet."
- [Tim pants]

16:03.839 --> 16:05.799
Look, I swear we're not gonna hurt you.

16:05.799 --> 16:06.967
[Cate] No, you can't do this.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.428
- I can't let you see where we're going.
- [Cate] No! You don't understand.

16:09.428 --> 16:11.263
I can't breathe. [panting] I can't--

16:11.263 --> 16:14.766
[hyperventilating] I can't--

16:14.766 --> 16:17.811
[Tim] Relax. You're gonna be fine.
Just breathe, okay?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.856
- [Cate] Let me out. Let me out!
- Calm down. Relax.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.650
- [Cate] Let me out! Let me out!
- [Tim] Relax. Calm down.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.528
Hey! [grunts]

16:27.446 --> 16:29.489
Get her under control, man.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.532
Let me out!

16:31.700 --> 16:33.076
[yelps]

16:34.578 --> 16:36.955

[Cate coughing, panting, groaning]

17:00.395 --> 17:01.313
[Tim grunts]

17:10.821 --> 17:12.031
[driver breathes heavily]

17:15.117 --> 17:17.246
[breathing heavily]

17:17.246 --> 17:19.330
[panting]

17:27.881 --> 17:28.715
What?

17:29.466 --> 17:30.843
[in Japanese]
Why aren't you answering my texts?

17:31.343 --> 17:33.554
[in English] When's the last time
I answered one of your texts?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.139
[in Japanese] I don't know... I thought...

17:36.139 --> 17:37.224
[in English] You thought?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.476
You thought that
because of your crazy family drama

17:39.476 --> 17:42.354
that what happened between us
is ancient history?

17:44.439 --> 17:46.024
What do you want from me?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.364
[in Japanese]
I found this in my father's office.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.576
[in English] I do audio, not home movies.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.080
I told you I was sorry.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.291
Apology accepted.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.126
I'm sorry too.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.255
I-- I grabbed onto you
to keep my head above water,

18:08.255 --> 18:09.882
and you didn't wanna drown. I get it.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.054
You should go home now.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.931
[stammers] Wait, wait, wait.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.517
[stutters] I want
those old computer files we found.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.685
Why?

18:21.685 --> 18:24.813
[stammers] Because they're mine.
What difference does it make to you?

18:24.813 --> 18:26.064
I'm busy.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.983
Come back tomorrow.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.114
[sighs]

19:04.728 --> 19:06.522
[Cate, in Japanese] She sounded French.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.067
[officer] You said they were American.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.151
[Cate] The man was.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.196
[officer] Tim?

19:15.697 --> 19:17.866
Do you have some identification?

19:22.079 --> 19:24.414
I lost my bag when I ran away.

19:25.791 --> 19:26.625
My passport...

19:27.292 --> 19:28.710
...my phone, all my money.

19:30.254 --> 19:32.548
And you're sure this wasn't some kind of...

19:32.840 --> 19:34.716
...misunderstanding?

19:36.301 --> 19:37.261
What?

19:38.136 --> 19:41.640
Tourists come here to enjoy
what Tokyo has to offer.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.227
The nightlife. Some karaoke.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.728
But...

19:46.979 --> 19:48.397
...it's easy to overindulge.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.441
You think I'm drunk?

19:53.068 --> 19:55.279
I was almost kidnapped!

20:01.368 --> 20:03.912
If you feel you are in danger...

20:05.080 --> 20:08.208
...I would recommend you contact the
American Embassy.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.003
Wait here.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.005
I will get you the address.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.487
[breathing heavily]

20:42.034 --> 20:42.993
I'm home.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.244
[parent] Welcome back.

20:53.712 --> 20:54.963
Have you had dinner?

20:55.672 --> 20:56.673
I'm not hungry.

20:56.673 --> 20:57.591
[chuckles] You haven't?

20:57.591 --> 20:59.092
I was going to warm up the curry.

21:00.511 --> 21:01.386
What's this?

21:02.387 --> 21:05.098
[parent] His life was not easy, you know.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.769
He lost so much when he was young.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.690
You're defending him?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.526
Aren't you angry?

21:16.777 --> 21:19.780
You're angry, Kentaro.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.200
Do you feel better?

21:34.336 --> 21:35.963
What are you doing?

21:37.214 --> 21:38.257
Now I'm angry too.

21:40.592 --> 21:41.885
Join me, Kentaro.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.971
[exclaims]

21:44.513 --> 21:45.514
[laughs]

21:45.514 --> 21:46.557
Seriously?!

21:46.932 --> 21:48.725
Throw it! [breathes heavily]

21:49.643 --> 21:50.686
- [chuckles]
- [exclaims]

21:50.686 --> 21:51.603
More.

21:51.603 --> 21:52.729
Here.

21:53.605 --> 21:54.940
[exclaims, chuckles]

21:55.774 --> 21:59.278
[breathes heavily, exclaims]

21:59.945 --> 22:01.113
[breathing heavily]

22:01.113 --> 22:03.282
Now we both feel better, right?

22:05.450 --> 22:06.827
[chuckles] A little.

22:07.578 --> 22:08.829
[chuckles]

22:10.706 --> 22:12.374
I'll warm up the curry.

22:19.715 --> 22:20.716
[sighs]

22:34.938 --> 22:37.608
[Billy, in English] So, you guys are
following the radiation, aren't you?

22:37.608 --> 22:38.734
And how do you know about that?

22:38.734 --> 22:40.986
Well, I know you're not gonna find
what's out there

22:40.986 --> 22:42.446
following a Geiger counter.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.364
[Keiko] What should we be following,
Mr. Randa?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.866
Just Billy.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.328
I think you should be following
the stories. Folklore. Legends.

22:49.328 --> 22:52.748
You know, the people of these mountains,
they have an oral tradition

22:52.748 --> 22:56.335
about a dragon that carves a path of fire
across the sky.

22:56.335 --> 22:57.669
Hmm.

22:57.669 --> 23:00.422
Or maybe a path of ionizing radiation.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.344
So, you're hunting dragons.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.931
[sighs] I told you,
I'm looking for the truth.

23:08.931 --> 23:10.933
That's great. But we got work to do,

23:10.933 --> 23:12.684
so it's time for you to hit the trail, bud.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.186
Wait a minute, Lieutenant.

23:14.186 --> 23:16.730
I don't think it's such a bad idea
for Mr. Randa to join us.

23:17.689 --> 23:18.982
I think it's a terrible idea.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.527
[chuckles] You're not here
to think for me, Lieutenant.

23:21.527 --> 23:23.987
- [inhales deeply]
- Look at him. Smell him.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.614
He's probably been lost out here
for weeks.

23:25.614 --> 23:27.241
Hey, hey. I know exactly where I am, pal.

23:27.241 --> 23:28.617
- Do you?
- Yes.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.995
No. Look, I am here at the behest
of the US Army, and my orders are--

23:31.995 --> 23:34.414
Your orders are to provide me
with whatever assistance I require.

23:34.414 --> 23:38.126
M-- My orders are to provide you
with operational security,

23:38.126 --> 23:42.172
and I cannot do that with our new friend,
Billy the jungle hermit, hanging around.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.340
[chuckles] Wow.

23:44.550 --> 23:46.009
[sighs]

23:47.052 --> 23:49.263
Fine. Just go then.

23:49.263 --> 23:51.348
[scoffs] Don't tempt me, Doc.

23:51.348 --> 23:54.226
[scoffs] I didn't ask for you.

23:54.226 --> 23:57.020
I don't need you and I don't want you.

23:57.020 --> 24:00.899
So, you are relieved of
any responsibility for me.

24:02.776 --> 24:03.944
Dismissed.

24:07.239 --> 24:08.782
I'll send someone back with the jeep.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.288
[engine starts]

24:21.086 --> 24:22.212
Shall we go?

24:36.393 --> 24:38.645
[Keiko] So, have you ever seen a dragon?

24:38.645 --> 24:40.105
- [Billy] Once.
- [Keiko] Oh.

24:40.105 --> 24:42.983
[Billy] Well, maybe.
It's kind of why I started doing this.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.735
Trying to prove I'm not crazy.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.111
You think I'm crazy?

24:46.111 --> 24:47.237
I don't even know you.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.655
[sighs] That's true.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.408
Do you often
follow strange men into the jungle?

24:51.408 --> 24:54.369
Uh, this is my second time today.

24:54.369 --> 24:57.039
- [chuckles, sighs]
- [chuckles]

24:57.039 --> 24:58.373
We call 'em MUTO's.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.461
For Massive Unidentified
Terrestrial Organisms.

25:02.461 --> 25:03.962
- I came up with that.
- Huh.

25:03.962 --> 25:07.633
Terrestrial.
So, you don't think they're space aliens?

25:07.633 --> 25:09.176
You do think I'm crazy.

25:09.176 --> 25:10.677
[sighs] I'm a scientist.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.888
I believe what
the evidence tells me to be true.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.097
- [breathes heavily]
- Okay.

25:15.098 --> 25:18.101
Everyone around here tells
some version of the same story.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.770
- Okay.
- Lights in the sky.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.358
And whatever's making them
has been tracing the same path

25:24.358 --> 25:27.986
over and over and over again,
going back centuries.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.989
- Like comets.
- No. More like migrating birds.

25:31.907 --> 25:32.908
Hold on.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.662
I have to show you something.
[breathes heavily]

25:36.662 --> 25:38.664
These... [inhales sharply] ...are the tracks
[exhales sharply]

25:38.664 --> 25:41.375
of the radiation readings
from our surveillance aircraft.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.836
[Keiko breathes heavily]

25:46.755 --> 25:47.881
See this?

25:48.715 --> 25:49.716
[breathing heavily]

25:54.930 --> 25:56.890
- [Billy scoffs]
- [Keiko] Incredible.

25:58.642 --> 25:59.643
[exhales sharply]

26:00.185 --> 26:01.770
- This way. This way. Come on.
- Okay.

26:02.479 --> 26:03.605
[Keiko] Where are we going?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.190
[Billy] We're following the map.

26:14.867 --> 26:17.035
[breathing heavily]

26:18.036 --> 26:19.079
We're almost there.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.290
[Keiko] Almost where?

26:24.251 --> 26:25.294
[sighs] What is it?

26:31.258 --> 26:32.426
What is that?

26:37.973 --> 26:38.974
The <i>Lawton.</i>

27:01.788 --> 27:04.124
[breathing shakily]

27:08.795 --> 27:10.797
[breathing shakily]

27:20.182 --> 27:21.183
[Tim] I don't know.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.184
[gasps]

27:22.184 --> 27:23.852
You wanna take a look
and see what's on these.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.687
I have no idea if they're any good but...

27:26.396 --> 27:27.397
[gasps]

27:29.358 --> 27:30.484
[shushes]

27:33.487 --> 27:34.488
[Duvall] You do it.

27:49.837 --> 27:50.879
[speaks Japanese]

27:50.879 --> 27:55.175
[in Japanese] Hiroshi was eighteen
when his father died in Vietnam.

27:59.221 --> 28:02.349
His Uncle Lee was
the only family he had left.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.270
If they were so close,
why didn't Dad ever mention him?

28:07.187 --> 28:08.188
[sighs]

28:08.188 --> 28:10.023
I think something happened between them.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.526
He didn't like to talk about

28:13.277 --> 28:15.821
some parts of his life.

28:17.948 --> 28:19.324
Is he still alive?

28:19.992 --> 28:20.826
[sighs]

28:20.826 --> 28:21.994
Oh, I don't know.

28:23.495 --> 28:25.455
This would have been a long time ago.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.249
[phone chimes]

28:28.166 --> 28:29.293
Sorry.

28:29.293 --> 28:30.252
Mmm.

28:31.295 --> 28:32.713
"CALL ME! IT'S IMPORTANT!"

28:33.839 --> 28:36.592
[doorbell rings]

28:36.592 --> 28:37.801
I'll get it.

28:37.801 --> 28:38.844
Thank you.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.137
[sighs]

28:47.186 --> 28:48.145
Good Evening.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.189
Do you speak English?

28:50.189 --> 28:51.607
[in English, stammers] Yes.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.901
Ah. That's-- That's great, actually.

28:53.901 --> 28:57.070
That makes this much easier...
[inhales sharply] ...for me anyway.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.155
May we come in?

28:58.155 --> 29:01.033
- No. Who are you?
- It's official business.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.827
[stammers] We're with
a special government task force.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.746
- Which government?
- [inhales sharply] You know what?

29:05.746 --> 29:08.457
We'll be in and out
before you even know it.

29:08.457 --> 29:11.585
Wow. You have a lovely home.
[speaks Japanese]

29:11.585 --> 29:13.045
[in Japanese] Who are they?

29:14.630 --> 29:16.131
[in English, stammers] What do you want?

29:17.591 --> 29:19.051
I want Bill Randa's files.

29:19.051 --> 29:20.344
No, you need to leave.

29:20.344 --> 29:22.763
No, you need to hand over those files.

29:22.763 --> 29:25.849
Otherwise, you, your friends,

29:25.849 --> 29:28.185
and your mother
are gonna be in a lot of trouble.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.436
[parent] Kentaro...?

29:29.436 --> 29:30.354
[in Japanese] It's okay.

29:30.938 --> 29:33.607
There's something that your son stole.

29:35.192 --> 29:37.152
He's going to have to come with us.

29:37.778 --> 29:38.987
[stutters]

29:38.987 --> 29:39.947
Is it true?

29:40.239 --> 29:42.074
Did you take something of theirs?

29:42.074 --> 29:43.534
They say I stole some files.

29:43.534 --> 29:44.743
Enough.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.370
Let's have it.

29:47.120 --> 29:52.084
If he returns whatever he took,
will you leave him alone?

29:52.668 --> 29:53.627
Of course.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.587
[exhales sharply]

29:56.171 --> 29:57.923
[inhales sharply, speaks Japanese]

29:58.507 --> 30:00.342
If you have what they are looking for...

30:01.009 --> 30:02.469
...you should give it to them.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.179
Are you sure?

30:04.513 --> 30:05.514
[sighs]

30:06.890 --> 30:09.560
It must be very important.

30:15.232 --> 30:16.233
[in English] I'll get it.

30:17.693 --> 30:20.445
Amazing. [stammers] Thank you.
[clears throat]

30:20.445 --> 30:23.031
Tea? You like tea?

30:24.032 --> 30:25.117
Tea?

30:25.117 --> 30:26.785
[Tim] Uh, no. We're good. Thanks.

30:26.785 --> 30:29.204
[in Japanese] I hope my son hasn't caused
any trouble for you.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.331
He's a good man now,

30:31.331 --> 30:33.959
but when he was younger
there were so many problems!

30:34.668 --> 30:36.545
- So much drinking!
- [in English] Hurry up!

30:36.545 --> 30:39.131
[in Japanese]
I wanted him to find a nice girl.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.633
Someone to settle him down.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.219
You are very attractive.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.554
Are you single?

30:49.433 --> 30:51.310
- [in English] Oh, shit.
- [door slams]

30:51.310 --> 30:53.645
- Shit.
- Kentaro!

30:53.645 --> 30:55.606
- [banging on door]
- [Tim] Open up!

30:55.814 --> 30:57.357
[in Japanese] Kentaro, run!

31:38.482 --> 31:39.733
[phone chimes]

31:46.490 --> 31:47.824
[Keiko] You know this ship?

31:47.824 --> 31:49.243
[Billy] USS <i>Lawton.</i>

31:50.202 --> 31:53.455
Went down 200 miles west of Pearl in 1943.

31:54.081 --> 31:55.457
Pearl Harbor?

31:56.250 --> 31:58.627
That's 5,000 miles from here.

31:58.627 --> 31:59.711
Exactly.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.506
[Billy exhales deeply]

32:07.678 --> 32:10.347
[ship creaks]

32:17.396 --> 32:18.564
[Keiko] Is this safe?

32:29.575 --> 32:30.742
Mr. Randa.

32:31.702 --> 32:34.746
You said you study myths, stories.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.624
I'm interested in why
people tell the stories they tell.

32:42.421 --> 32:44.047
[Billy] What inspired the storyteller.

32:44.047 --> 32:48.468
- [ship creaks, rumbles]
- [gasps, breathing shakily]

32:51.805 --> 32:52.806
What terrified 'em.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.766
[breathing shakily]

33:11.366 --> 33:12.367
[Keiko] What is it?

33:14.786 --> 33:17.539
Mr. Randa.
Maybe we should stick together--

33:22.753 --> 33:24.421
[grunts]

33:26.632 --> 33:27.841
[sighs]

33:32.930 --> 33:33.931
[Keiko] Mr. Randa.

33:36.767 --> 33:37.768
Billy.

33:39.811 --> 33:41.063
[sighs]

33:47.569 --> 33:49.112
You were on this ship.

33:52.824 --> 33:53.825
Yeah.

33:57.246 --> 33:58.956
Is this what you were looking for?

33:59.623 --> 34:01.124
Did you know it was here?

34:05.087 --> 34:06.088
Did I know?

34:10.926 --> 34:12.135
Let's say hoped.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.223
Not very scientific.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.645
[sighs] I know we hit something
in the water that night.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.981
We figured it was a Japanese sub.

34:26.233 --> 34:29.110
[sighs] The whole ship went down
in less than three minutes.

34:30.779 --> 34:31.864
Who else survived?

34:36.451 --> 34:37.452
Only me.

34:53.427 --> 34:56.388
[Geiger counter whirring]

35:41.558 --> 35:42.768
[in Japanese] Going to the back.

35:42.768 --> 35:43.852
Okay.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.912
[in English] Who are you? Jason Bourne?

36:03.413 --> 36:05.624
You're from San Francisco.
You were there that day.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.417
You don't have a bag packed,

36:07.417 --> 36:09.753
ready to head for higher ground
when the tide starts rising?

36:09.753 --> 36:12.881
Yeah. It's full of bottled water
and batteries, not extra passports.

36:16.677 --> 36:18.262
- May.
- Hey, are you okay?

36:19.054 --> 36:20.597
What is she doing here?

36:20.597 --> 36:22.474
Hey. Whoa. She's in this too.

36:24.643 --> 36:25.936
Somebody's after those files.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.521
Why don't we just give 'em what they want?

36:27.521 --> 36:29.731
[scoffs]
Maybe then they'll leave all of us alone.

36:29.731 --> 36:31.441
Okay, yeah. Good luck with that.

36:31.441 --> 36:32.776
What's your plan? Just run?

36:32.776 --> 36:35.320
Me? I have contacts.
I can get us fake passports.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.865
I don't want a fake passport.
I want my real passport.

36:37.865 --> 36:39.157
I haven't done anything wrong.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.243
Okay. When have people in power
ever cared about--

36:41.243 --> 36:42.327
Hold on.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.414
I know where to go.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.542
Trust me.

36:49.710 --> 36:50.711
Come on.

36:58.260 --> 37:00.679
- [Keiko] What is that?
- [Billy] I don't know.

37:02.681 --> 37:05.100
[Billy sighs] Looks organic.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.750
[Billy gasps, exclaims]

37:31.168 --> 37:33.587
Oh-- [groans, pants]

37:35.380 --> 37:36.381
Oh, God.

37:41.428 --> 37:42.763
[Keiko] There are so many.

37:46.767 --> 37:48.977
[inhales shakily]
When did you say this ship sank?

37:50.229 --> 37:51.438
Nine years ago.

37:54.191 --> 37:56.109
I think I've seen everything I need to
in here.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.361
Yeah.

38:04.493 --> 38:07.996
[breathes heavily]
That wasn't there before.

38:07.996 --> 38:09.790
- [Billy] This is fresh.
- Fresh what?

38:10.457 --> 38:12.376
We'll find another way outta here.

38:12.376 --> 38:14.002
- How did it get here?
- [grunts]

38:14.002 --> 38:15.838
Is there something in here
that's making it--

38:15.838 --> 38:17.214
I don't know. Come on.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.111
[in Japanese]
You're here to see the Colonel?

38:39.111 --> 38:41.113
Yes, we are.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.448
[in Japanese, stammers]
If he's still alive.

38:43.824 --> 38:45.701
So, we can see the Colonel?

39:07.681 --> 39:08.974
[in English] Colonel Shaw?

39:22.446 --> 39:23.447
What's your name?

39:24.740 --> 39:25.741
Kentaro.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.284
Kentaro what?

39:27.284 --> 39:28.368
Randa.

39:28.869 --> 39:34.583
[inhales deeply] Oh, my God.
[chuckles] You're Hiroshi's boy.

39:34.583 --> 39:36.335
[Lee inhales deeply]

39:36.335 --> 39:37.920
[stammers] And you?

39:37.920 --> 39:40.464
I'm Cate Randa.

39:41.173 --> 39:42.257
Course you are.

39:45.344 --> 39:48.430
I, uh-- I didn't know
Hiroshi even had a daughter.

39:48.430 --> 39:50.599
[Cate scoffs]
Well, I didn't know he had a son.

39:50.599 --> 39:53.227
Turns out he was good at keeping secrets.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.191
[chuckles] Not my drama. No relation.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.653
- We wanted to ask you about our fa--
- W-Why don't we, um...

40:05.239 --> 40:06.240
Yeah. Come on.

40:07.449 --> 40:08.450
Let's get some air.

40:09.451 --> 40:10.577
Come on.

40:15.666 --> 40:19.002
If you guys could just kinda keep
your voices down, that'd be good.

40:19.002 --> 40:20.587
Tell me, how'd you get here?

40:21.421 --> 40:22.422
Rented a minivan.

40:22.422 --> 40:25.801
That's good.
But I mean, how did you find me?

40:26.635 --> 40:27.636
My mom.

40:27.636 --> 40:29.221
- Emiko.
- Yes.

40:30.722 --> 40:31.723
[chuckles]

40:33.976 --> 40:35.561
We found something in my father's safe.

40:35.561 --> 40:37.271
- Kentaro.
- What? He's my great uncle Lee.

40:37.271 --> 40:39.314
What did you find in the safe?

40:39.314 --> 40:40.691
Old computer files.

40:40.691 --> 40:43.193
Bunch of crazy shit. Monster shit.

40:43.193 --> 40:47.364
[shushes] Can you please,
please keep your voices down?

40:48.657 --> 40:51.910
What's this all about? Why are you here?
And you gotta make it kinda quick.

40:51.910 --> 40:54.079
We wanna find out
what happened to my father.

40:55.205 --> 40:56.206
[stammers] You tell me.

40:57.499 --> 41:00.377
Right after G-Day,
he said he had someplace he needed to go.

41:00.377 --> 41:01.545
Wouldn't tell us where,

41:01.545 --> 41:03.463
but a week later
we were told the plane he was on

41:03.463 --> 41:05.299
disappeared somewhere in Alaska.

41:05.299 --> 41:07.843
[scoffs] Turns out he had
a whole secret life in Japan.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.470
I came here to try and figure it out,

41:10.470 --> 41:12.973
but now we're being chased by
these Monarch people and, uh--

41:12.973 --> 41:15.934
"Disappeared"? As in, no body?

41:15.934 --> 41:17.519
<i>No death certificate?</i>

41:18.395 --> 41:20.522
- What are you saying?
- Hey.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.567
Hey, w-what is this place? Huh?

41:23.567 --> 41:28.780
Oh, this place is what Monarch
euphemistically refers to

41:28.780 --> 41:30.824
as "secure asset management."

41:32.075 --> 41:33.535
Right. So, you're imprisoned here.

41:33.535 --> 41:35.370
Okay. Well, we're leaving. Mmm.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.873
Yeah, you can try,
but they're just gonna keep following you

41:37.873 --> 41:41.460
and following you and following you,
until they finally get what they want.

41:41.960 --> 41:42.961
Or?

41:42.961 --> 41:44.338
Well, that's up to you.

41:44.922 --> 41:47.341
Now, you can choke down
that mountain of Monarch bullshit

41:47.341 --> 41:49.843
about your father disappearing
without a trace.

41:53.472 --> 41:56.558
Or... [sighs] ...we can
get the hell outta here right now

41:56.558 --> 41:58.894
and find out what really happened
with your dad.

41:59.478 --> 42:00.312
[grunts]

42:03.023 --> 42:05.692
Now you got just about 60 seconds
to make up your minds.

42:10.906 --> 42:12.115
What's it gonna be?

42:19.623 --> 42:20.666
Here, this way.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.000
[Keiko] Are you sure?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.337
I did two tours in this tin can, Doc.
[breathes deeply]

42:25.337 --> 42:26.463
[exhales sharply]

42:26.463 --> 42:27.840
[growling]

42:27.840 --> 42:29.383
[gasps] What is that?

42:33.637 --> 42:36.306
- Let's keep it moving. Come on.
- [Keiko] Okay.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.060
- [growling]
- [Billy] Whoa!

42:40.060 --> 42:41.144
[Keiko] Are you all right?

42:41.144 --> 42:42.896
[Billy] Oh, Jesus Christ.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.940
- Go back! Go!
- [pants] Oh, my God.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.359
[panting]

42:47.359 --> 42:49.653
[grunts, screams] Oh, my God!

42:49.653 --> 42:50.946
No.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.031
- [groans]
- Hang on!

42:53.031 --> 42:56.410
[grunts, screaming]

42:56.410 --> 42:58.328
[Keiko] It's leaving! Now's our chance!

42:58.328 --> 43:00.831
[groaning]

43:00.831 --> 43:02.291
- Push!
- I am pushing!

43:02.291 --> 43:04.459
- [Keiko] Come on!
- [Billy yells, grunts]

43:04.459 --> 43:06.628
Where'd it go? [groans]

43:08.922 --> 43:10.174
- [Billy] Help!
- [groans]

43:10.174 --> 43:11.258
[Billy] Hurry!

43:11.258 --> 43:12.968
What the hell is going on?

43:12.968 --> 43:15.387
- [Keiko] Help! Help!
- [Billy] Come on!

43:16.180 --> 43:18.056
- Watch out!
- Holy shit!

43:18.056 --> 43:19.808
[grunts, pants]

43:21.268 --> 43:23.061
Oh! Oh, my God!

43:23.645 --> 43:24.938
Oh, my God!

43:24.938 --> 43:26.106
Help me get him out!

43:26.106 --> 43:28.483
- [panting]
- Come on! Before it comes back!

43:28.483 --> 43:30.027
Okay. [grunts]

43:30.027 --> 43:31.195
Here we go.

43:31.195 --> 43:32.487
One, two, three.

43:32.487 --> 43:34.239
[straining]

43:34.239 --> 43:36.200
[grunts] It's too heavy.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.492
[groaning]

43:37.492 --> 43:40.078
I'm gonna stick this under,
and we're all gonna lift, okay?

43:40.078 --> 43:41.079
- Okay.
- [Billy grunts]

43:41.079 --> 43:42.956
One, two, three.

43:42.956 --> 43:47.461
Go! [grunts] Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Billy! Hey, get up!

43:47.461 --> 43:48.837
[panting, groaning]

43:48.837 --> 43:51.215
- [Lee] Go! Go, go, go!
- [Keiko] Okay, okay.

43:55.427 --> 43:57.387
- [grunts, pants]
- Go!

43:58.013 --> 44:00.849
[grunts] Go, go, go!

44:00.849 --> 44:04.102
[panting, grunting]

44:05.270 --> 44:06.563
[panting]

44:06.563 --> 44:10.359
- [panting]
- [growling]

44:10.359 --> 44:11.944
Go! Go, go, go, go!

44:11.944 --> 44:13.445
[panting]

44:16.406 --> 44:18.825
[shrieking]

44:21.286 --> 44:23.664
[panting, grunting]

44:24.581 --> 44:26.083
[panting]

44:26.083 --> 44:27.584
[dragon shrieking]

44:27.584 --> 44:28.919
Oh, my God.

44:29.503 --> 44:31.338
[pants] It is a dragon.

44:32.256 --> 44:34.550
[dragon shrieking]

44:34.550 --> 44:35.634
[groans]

44:36.218 --> 44:37.803
[pants]

44:37.803 --> 44:40.597
[panting]

44:46.979 --> 44:50.023
It's... [pants] ...incredible.

44:54.945 --> 44:56.572
[dragon shrieking]

44:58.657 --> 45:02.536
[shrieking]
