00:54.800 --> 00:57.963
Mortal Kombat
is not about death...

00:58.004 --> 01:01.462
but, rather,
the preservation of life.

01:01.506 --> 01:04.964
Liu Kang and few fighters
from the Earth Realm...

01:05.044 --> 01:07.945
defeated Outworld sorcerer
Shang Tsung.

01:09.082 --> 01:10.811
According to the rules
of Mortal Kombat...

01:10.850 --> 01:15.617
their victory preserved earth's
safety for another generation.

01:16.356 --> 01:19.416
Our chosen ones
were returned to earth...

01:19.460 --> 01:21.928
only to enjoy
a brief period of peace.

01:25.265 --> 01:29.463
For someone from Outworld
has a different point of view.

02:49.054 --> 02:51.887
Shao-Kahn, emperor of Outworld.

02:52.792 --> 02:56.421
The earth
was created in six days...

02:56.462 --> 03:00.159
so shall it be destroyed.

03:00.934 --> 03:07.066
On the seventh day,
mankind will rest in peace!

03:10.944 --> 03:12.468
This is not good.

03:12.512 --> 03:15.242
Somehow he's opened gateways
to your world.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.876
Our Mortal Kombat victory
closed those portals.

03:17.951 --> 03:19.816
What closes can open again.

03:19.887 --> 03:21.377
What does that mean?

03:28.229 --> 03:29.423
Mother.

03:31.433 --> 03:32.661
You're alive.

03:32.701 --> 03:36.262
Too bad you... will die.

03:51.653 --> 03:55.145
As long as I have the power,
you will never rule this world.

03:55.224 --> 04:00.321
As long as the portal is open,
your world becomes mine!

04:19.951 --> 04:22.077
You will never win.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.953
Master.

05:08.903 --> 05:10.427
This ends now!

05:10.471 --> 05:12.336
You hide behind a human?

05:12.872 --> 05:15.272
Why not, Lord Rayden?

05:15.309 --> 05:18.039
You hid behind them
your entire life.

05:20.781 --> 05:22.510
No, Johnny!

05:37.132 --> 05:40.124
Surrender, Rayden, or he dies.

05:42.205 --> 05:43.695
I'll take your generals.

05:43.740 --> 05:46.732
Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.

05:46.775 --> 05:51.371
You would never let
one of your humans die.

05:59.556 --> 06:01.456
Trade me for Johnny Cage.

06:01.491 --> 06:05.222
Come bow at my feet.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.560
You fool!

06:29.020 --> 06:34.424
In six days, you will bow to me!

06:36.194 --> 06:38.287
It has begun!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.713
We can't let Kahn get away.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.350
We can't win here.

07:05.393 --> 07:07.452
Annihilate 'em!

07:12.066 --> 07:13.533
We must go.

07:26.849 --> 07:28.043
Move back!

07:34.323 --> 07:35.654
Kahn opened the portal.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.986
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one.

07:40.863 --> 07:42.728
Think of it as hell on earth.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.137
My mother... resurrected.

07:51.274 --> 07:52.935
How is that possible?

07:52.977 --> 07:56.037
Your mother Sindel
may be the key.

07:56.079 --> 07:58.343
This can't be!
We won the tournament!

07:58.382 --> 08:00.873
The rules say earth is safe
for another generation.

08:00.918 --> 08:03.443
Kahn has broken the rules.

08:03.486 --> 08:07.149
He resurrected Sindel to keep
these portals open indefinitely.

08:07.191 --> 08:11.287
By reuniting you with her,
Kahn's spell will be broken...

08:12.129 --> 08:14.859
your mother's soul
will be at peace...

08:14.900 --> 08:16.458
and his portals closed.

08:16.501 --> 08:18.526
How could the Elder Gods
allow this?

08:18.603 --> 08:19.968
They do not know.

08:20.037 --> 08:22.972
Kahn must be stopped,
or your world will perish.

08:23.008 --> 08:25.442
We have six days
until annihilation.

08:25.477 --> 08:28.446
I beat Shang Tsung.
I can beat Kahn.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.540
You beat a great sorcerer...

08:32.452 --> 08:34.419
but you're no match for Kahn.

08:34.453 --> 08:37.514
If anyone's killing Kahn,
it's me.

08:37.557 --> 08:38.717
Enough!

08:44.697 --> 08:46.289
You are far from ready.

08:46.332 --> 08:51.269
Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting.

08:51.338 --> 08:53.499
I am telling you this
for your own good.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.566
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.

08:56.643 --> 09:00.807
As the two realms merge,
I will lose my powers on earth.

09:00.848 --> 09:04.215
You must grow stronger,
together.

09:05.119 --> 09:07.053
We are the only hope.

09:15.030 --> 09:18.466
We couldn't even save Johnny.

09:22.471 --> 09:24.132
What do these do?

09:24.173 --> 09:28.633
Inside the velosphere, you can
go anywhere on earth in hours.

09:28.711 --> 09:30.679
The inner winds propel you.

09:31.681 --> 09:35.082
You'll move so fast, it'll be
like you're not moving.

09:38.555 --> 09:39.920
We need your help, Sonya.

09:39.956 --> 09:42.220
I'll take you
to your partner Jax.

09:42.259 --> 09:45.922
Forget it. If I die, fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.

09:45.962 --> 09:47.327
Alone, you are vulnerable...

09:47.364 --> 09:50.856
but if you work together,
you can do much.

09:50.901 --> 09:52.061
What about us?

09:52.102 --> 09:54.297
You two will travel
to the Hopi mesa.

09:54.338 --> 09:58.138
You did great last time,
but now you need help.

09:58.174 --> 10:00.404
Go deep into the night.

10:00.478 --> 10:03.038
Seek the counsel of Nightwolf.

10:03.114 --> 10:05.912
You will not find him.
He will find you.

10:07.385 --> 10:12.687
I will speak with the Elder Gods
and demand answers.

10:12.724 --> 10:14.521
- Ready?
- Ready.

10:14.559 --> 10:15.787
Here we go.

10:19.231 --> 10:21.461
They are faster than I remember.

10:21.501 --> 10:22.798
I can't wait.

10:33.012 --> 10:34.104
This is amazing.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.045
It's the hot air
from earth's core.

10:36.082 --> 10:37.549
We harness its energy.

10:44.491 --> 10:46.049
Where are we?

10:46.093 --> 10:48.084
The interchange.
Roll to your right.

10:53.301 --> 10:54.632
Hold on to me.

11:51.496 --> 11:54.192
Father, the merger has begun.

11:54.232 --> 11:56.223
Earth is under attack.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.861
It is glorious!

11:58.904 --> 12:04.035
Did you make Rayden beg
before destroying him?

12:12.685 --> 12:15.313
Rayden is of no concern.

12:19.024 --> 12:20.992
You let him live?

12:22.595 --> 12:24.085
He could not be stopped.

12:25.197 --> 12:27.665
I have no use for excuses.

12:28.635 --> 12:32.230
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.639
If the Elder Gods
learn of our plot...

12:34.674 --> 12:37.541
we shall both
suffer the consequences.

12:37.578 --> 12:38.840
I do not understand.

12:38.879 --> 12:41.871
How can you fear the Elder Gods?

12:41.915 --> 12:45.476
With control of earth,
our power will be absolute.

12:45.553 --> 12:48.681
Until the sixth day
has passed...

12:48.757 --> 12:51.783
we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.

12:54.596 --> 12:58.555
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.

13:35.639 --> 13:39.097
Liu, if anything happens to me...

13:39.676 --> 13:43.635
Kitana, I have lost everything.

13:47.818 --> 13:50.651
I am not going to lose you, too.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.798
The missile!

16:24.751 --> 16:25.945
You must go.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.510
There will be others.

16:29.023 --> 16:30.422
I killed you.

16:32.894 --> 16:34.521
You killed my older brother.

16:35.897 --> 16:37.125
Why did you help us?

16:37.165 --> 16:38.962
I helped her.

16:39.033 --> 16:43.595
Legend says the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn.

16:43.672 --> 16:46.163
You've been following us.
Why?

16:46.240 --> 16:50.108
Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you...

16:50.145 --> 16:52.443
in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.

16:54.483 --> 16:56.348
How do we get to Nightwolf?

16:56.385 --> 16:58.876
We have a common enemy,
Sub-Zero.

16:58.921 --> 17:02.755
You must help us
if you want to stop Kahn.

17:07.964 --> 17:09.932
Let's hope you succeed.

17:44.269 --> 17:46.100
Get over here!

19:25.276 --> 19:26.573
Take it!

19:30.348 --> 19:32.077
Suckers!

19:40.025 --> 19:41.549
I've got to find Kitana.

19:41.593 --> 19:44.027
Kahn wants you to go after her.

19:44.063 --> 19:45.621
Don't.

19:45.664 --> 19:47.859
Without Kitana, it's over.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.529
You alone are not ready
for what's ahead.

20:17.865 --> 20:21.824
You'll take the same track back
and turn where I showed you.

20:21.870 --> 20:23.565
Don't worry about me.

20:27.876 --> 20:29.935
Is it like this everywhere?

20:31.279 --> 20:33.770
Each hour, the merger
of the realms grows closer.

20:35.483 --> 20:37.576
More of the earth
will be destroyed.

20:43.191 --> 20:46.024
I will meet you
at the temple of the Elder Gods.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.969
Jax!

21:04.147 --> 21:06.274
Thought I was supposed
to be rescuing you.

21:06.351 --> 21:08.114
I couldn't wait.

21:09.086 --> 21:11.577
What have you done
to yourself now?

21:11.656 --> 21:13.624
Cybernetic strength-enhancers.

21:13.691 --> 21:17.127
It quadruples
your muscle capacity.

21:17.195 --> 21:19.891
You've got a confidence problem.

21:23.968 --> 21:27.802
These locks must be
on some remote-access mechanism.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.535
What you doing here?

21:29.575 --> 21:31.008
Everybody split.

21:31.043 --> 21:33.739
The facility will be trashed
by an extermination squad.

21:33.779 --> 21:36.942
What you mean,
extermination squad?

21:36.982 --> 21:39.678
They're trying to kill me,
probably you, too.

21:39.752 --> 21:41.583
I don't even know them.

21:45.725 --> 21:46.953
Damn it!

21:46.993 --> 21:48.620
I can't free you.

21:48.661 --> 21:51.221
Stand back.
Let's see what I'm made of.

21:58.171 --> 22:00.002
That's what I'm talking about.

22:06.614 --> 22:08.445
Wish I had these in high school.

22:08.482 --> 22:10.313
You'll wish
you were in high school.

22:11.919 --> 22:13.045
Hurry!

22:26.368 --> 22:28.268
What is that?

23:12.584 --> 23:15.382
Death is the only way out.

23:15.420 --> 23:20.380
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade...
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.755
Shao what?

23:23.229 --> 23:24.821
I'll take homeboy.

23:32.104 --> 23:35.403
I take it this ain't something
we can talk about.

24:17.419 --> 24:18.943
Heads up!

24:36.339 --> 24:37.966
Catch this!

25:06.238 --> 25:07.728
Now what?

25:14.179 --> 25:16.841
Cybernetic strength-enhancers!

25:42.709 --> 25:44.472
Nice look...

25:44.511 --> 25:45.739
but I'd lose the wall.

25:45.779 --> 25:48.043
I was just getting
a feel for it.

25:50.585 --> 25:51.984
Watch out.

26:40.571 --> 26:42.334
You barbecued his ass.

26:43.907 --> 26:45.067
Look at this.

27:00.459 --> 27:02.188
Does this mean what I think?

27:02.227 --> 27:04.218
Too bad I didn't get new legs.

27:31.457 --> 27:35.450
My squads have claimed thousands
of innocent souls on earth.

27:35.496 --> 27:37.794
I will claim millions.

27:37.831 --> 27:41.323
By now, you'd be behind bars
in a zoo.

27:41.368 --> 27:45.099
If those bars kept me away
from you, Sheeva...

27:45.140 --> 27:46.698
I would welcome them!

27:57.252 --> 27:58.480
Silence!

28:03.825 --> 28:05.349
What is your report?

28:05.393 --> 28:08.089
Two of earth's best warriors
have been taken...

28:08.130 --> 28:09.995
Kabaal and Stryker.

28:10.032 --> 28:15.299
Did you make them beg
before you destroyed them?

28:15.337 --> 28:17.897
I thought if I let them live...

28:17.941 --> 28:19.465
I have no use for excuses!

28:27.984 --> 28:33.889
Rain,
this will never happen again.

28:33.925 --> 28:36.359
It will never happen again.

28:43.434 --> 28:46.562
It is true
this will never happen again.

28:47.605 --> 28:49.766
I need a new general.

28:51.976 --> 28:55.434
You can die in duty
or by my hand.

28:55.481 --> 28:57.449
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.

28:57.483 --> 29:01.317
As general, I will personally
hunt down every human soul...

29:01.353 --> 29:03.321
and spare no one!

29:03.355 --> 29:04.913
Motaro can't be trusted.

29:04.957 --> 29:08.723
Long ago, I proved myself
as the protector of Sindel.

29:08.761 --> 29:11.753
Your orders are mine to follow.

29:11.798 --> 29:14.494
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...

29:14.534 --> 29:17.628
I would use to capture souls.

29:19.205 --> 29:22.368
You are all too impetuous
for such important work.

29:23.744 --> 29:28.738
You are my new general,
Queen Sindel...

29:30.217 --> 29:34.051
unless anyone
has a different point of view.

31:17.798 --> 31:19.629
Pretty cool, huh?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.858
It's my animality.

31:21.902 --> 31:23.767
Who are you?

31:23.804 --> 31:25.396
Wouldn't you like to know?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.172
So you're Rayden's prodigy.

31:29.277 --> 31:30.471
I've seen better.

31:31.712 --> 31:32.872
Don't sweat it.

31:32.914 --> 31:34.882
I've seen worse, too.

31:36.450 --> 31:40.910
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won Mortal Kombat.

31:40.956 --> 31:43.015
Don't get cocky.

31:43.091 --> 31:44.683
The tournament had rules.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.284
This time, anything goes.

31:49.031 --> 31:51.090
It was a mistake coming here.

31:52.167 --> 31:53.828
You think you're ready...

31:53.869 --> 31:56.394
but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?

32:00.944 --> 32:02.536
Can you help me get her back?

32:04.647 --> 32:05.807
Maybe.

32:05.848 --> 32:07.440
Kitana is important.

32:07.484 --> 32:10.214
To beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.387
First one's courage.

32:12.456 --> 32:15.050
I don't have time
for these stupid games!

32:15.125 --> 32:18.060
To test your courage
and find your animality...

32:18.095 --> 32:20.359
you've got to enter
a dream state.

32:20.965 --> 32:23.365
How am I supposed to do that?

32:26.704 --> 32:31.334
There's a slow way
and a fast way.

32:31.376 --> 32:33.537
No time for the slow way.

32:34.579 --> 32:36.046
That's what I thought you'd say.

32:39.185 --> 32:40.948
Sweet dreams.

32:51.130 --> 32:55.533
I had faith in you,
but you failed me.

32:56.436 --> 32:58.301
You are not the warrior
I thought you were.

32:59.505 --> 33:02.406
What if I fail everyone?

33:02.442 --> 33:04.603
Your brother's soul is mine!

33:10.717 --> 33:12.742
Fight from the inside.

33:12.787 --> 33:17.053
It's the fire inside of you,
your faith in yourself...

33:17.458 --> 33:19.289
that can never be defeated.

33:20.962 --> 33:24.728
The fire inside you is killed.

33:24.766 --> 33:27.234
You lost Kitana.

33:27.268 --> 33:28.735
You are not a leader.

33:28.804 --> 33:30.635
Find that power inside you.

33:31.606 --> 33:33.073
Feel your animality.

33:42.051 --> 33:45.452
You will fail!

34:36.440 --> 34:37.908
I am Jade.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.811
I have searched the mesa
for you.

34:51.157 --> 34:54.251
Of all the horrors
darkness holds...

34:54.293 --> 34:56.853
to die alone...

34:58.599 --> 35:00.260
that is my worst fear.

35:08.075 --> 35:11.511
With you, I'm not afraid.

35:15.382 --> 35:18.078
This is almost
too good to be true.

35:21.089 --> 35:23.353
The same
could be said about you.

35:35.037 --> 35:36.231
My heart...

35:38.407 --> 35:40.341
belongs to another.

35:54.424 --> 35:56.016
I can't.

35:56.060 --> 35:57.618
There's not much time left.

36:12.543 --> 36:14.408
Is this just another dream?

36:24.790 --> 36:29.454
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when I am too much for you?

36:55.588 --> 36:58.284
First you betray me,
now you laugh?

36:58.325 --> 37:01.192
You are more pure and faithful
than I heard.

37:02.730 --> 37:04.857
You have passed the test.

37:05.866 --> 37:07.128
A test?

37:11.105 --> 37:13.403
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's tests?

37:15.543 --> 37:17.306
We could have killed each other!

37:17.379 --> 37:18.869
But we'll live.

37:25.987 --> 37:28.148
I will lead you to the temple
of the Elder Gods.

37:28.189 --> 37:30.157
I can't.

37:30.192 --> 37:32.490
If this was a test,
it was only his second.

37:32.528 --> 37:34.052
I'm not ready.

37:34.095 --> 37:36.256
Not ready to save Kitana?

37:37.233 --> 37:39.497
Because she's the key.

37:39.535 --> 37:42.003
I can take you to her.

37:42.039 --> 37:43.506
She's alive?

37:43.539 --> 37:46.838
For now, yes.
For how long, I cannot say.

37:51.748 --> 37:53.215
We must go.

38:15.106 --> 38:18.200
All your past betrayals
I can forgive.

38:19.845 --> 38:22.370
Please accept this offering.

38:22.448 --> 38:24.416
I do not want your death.

38:53.647 --> 38:56.377
You test my patience.

39:02.991 --> 39:04.856
You destroyed my family.

39:04.892 --> 39:07.520
You drove my mother
to kill herself.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.030
I am your enemy forever.

39:11.566 --> 39:14.467
Kill me now... if you dare.

39:14.503 --> 39:17.495
Foolish child.

39:20.409 --> 39:23.378
A struggling worm on a hook...

39:23.412 --> 39:26.074
lands a bigger catch
than a dead one.

39:40.731 --> 39:44.167
No trees, no animals.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.534
What's going on here?

39:48.772 --> 39:50.239
Nature's dying.

39:53.177 --> 39:55.577
The merger of the realms
is almost done.

39:55.612 --> 39:58.240
You keep talking
about mergers and realms...

39:58.283 --> 39:59.807
but it don't mean squat to me.

39:59.884 --> 40:01.977
I can't explain it.

40:02.053 --> 40:04.886
We've only got a few days.

40:04.923 --> 40:06.754
Use your imagination.

40:06.791 --> 40:08.281
Use my imagination?

40:12.330 --> 40:15.026
You keep talking like that,
and I'm gonna split.

40:16.836 --> 40:19.669
You dragged me out the base
with some killers after us...

40:19.705 --> 40:22.105
put me in a ball, take me
halfway around the world.

40:22.141 --> 40:24.200
If I'm gonna die today,
tell me why.

40:25.145 --> 40:27.807
Nobody told me
why Johnny had to die.

40:28.714 --> 40:30.238
What is it with you?

40:30.283 --> 40:31.716
Who the hell is Johnny?

40:33.186 --> 40:34.778
I'm your partner.

40:34.855 --> 40:36.755
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

40:36.790 --> 40:39.156
Nobody but me.

40:39.192 --> 40:40.955
Nobody but you?

40:40.995 --> 40:43.828
Every time you needed me,
I was there.

40:43.864 --> 40:46.526
I'm in the middle of nowhere
because of you!

40:48.336 --> 40:51.032
I need to use the rest room.
I got no toilet tissue.

40:51.072 --> 40:53.632
I got metal on my hands!

41:34.183 --> 41:35.946
You wish.

43:00.775 --> 43:03.141
I told you these arms were good
for something.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.550
Thanks.

43:13.523 --> 43:14.717
I owe you one.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.953
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

43:16.992 --> 43:19.119
You look good in mud.

43:20.730 --> 43:21.958
You do.

43:24.301 --> 43:26.098
I got to find a river.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.335
We better roll.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.970
They don't use parachutes.

44:12.685 --> 44:15.586
I have come
to the eternal palace...

44:15.621 --> 44:18.385
because your sacred rules
have been broken.

44:23.996 --> 44:26.157
Shao-Kahn has invaded the earth.

44:42.550 --> 44:46.748
As always,
you are granted three questions.

44:50.158 --> 44:52.251
Why was this treachery allowed?

44:52.294 --> 44:55.195
We do not control man's destiny.

44:55.230 --> 44:58.666
Everyone can change their fate.

45:02.004 --> 45:04.472
You'll stand by and watch
the ruination of earth?

45:04.540 --> 45:05.837
You are correct.

45:05.875 --> 45:09.367
Kitana is the key
to closing Kahn's portals.

45:10.647 --> 45:13.275
If I reunite her with Sindel...

45:13.316 --> 45:16.808
how can I be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed?

45:16.853 --> 45:21.119
Only when Shao-Kahn is destroyed
will the future be safe.

45:21.158 --> 45:25.595
Do you believe the humans
are worth saving?

45:25.630 --> 45:28.326
More than anything I know.

45:28.365 --> 45:32.233
Do you love them enough
to sacrifice your immortality?

45:44.415 --> 45:46.440
I don't see street signs,
mailboxes.

45:46.485 --> 45:48.180
Which temple's the Elder Gods'?

45:48.220 --> 45:49.744
Keep moving.

46:02.502 --> 46:03.628
You know this dude?

46:08.408 --> 46:10.239
Is that Jax?

46:10.310 --> 46:11.937
Who is she?

46:12.011 --> 46:14.707
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.

46:16.050 --> 46:17.813
Major Jackson Briggs.

46:18.785 --> 46:22.221
You've got incredible legs...
for kicking.

46:23.724 --> 46:25.316
Where Kitana?

46:27.361 --> 46:29.625
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.

46:29.663 --> 46:31.893
You lost Kitana
and picked up her?

46:31.933 --> 46:33.491
She helped me get here.

46:35.102 --> 46:38.629
Thanks to you,
we got Kahn's squads on us.

46:38.673 --> 46:40.300
Can I make a suggestion?

46:40.375 --> 46:44.539
Let's worry about bigger things,
like staying alive.

47:13.442 --> 47:14.875
He's not here, either.

47:14.945 --> 47:16.879
We're just gonna wait
for this dude?

47:16.914 --> 47:18.438
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.

47:26.991 --> 47:28.754
Never give up hope.

47:32.430 --> 47:34.057
At least not so early.

47:34.933 --> 47:36.400
It's a new look.

47:38.836 --> 47:41.464
Who's she? Can she fight
as good as she looks?

47:41.507 --> 47:42.997
Better.

47:43.042 --> 47:45.567
Good, because I was expecting
a team of fighters.

47:45.611 --> 47:48.102
Instead, I hear fighters
at war with each other.

47:48.147 --> 47:50.445
Give us a break.
We've been through hell.

47:50.516 --> 47:53.314
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.948
Where's Kitana?

47:55.988 --> 47:58.582
Kahn took her.
It's all my fault.

47:58.625 --> 48:00.593
This is not about blame.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.322
We're together in this.

48:02.362 --> 48:06.822
Each of us must support
the others, like a family.

48:06.866 --> 48:08.094
What's with your arms?

48:08.134 --> 48:11.103
I've known you one minute,
and you're dissin' me already?

48:11.137 --> 48:13.002
I mean no disrespect.

48:13.039 --> 48:14.631
You have real skills.

48:14.675 --> 48:16.939
Those arms aren't your strength.
They're your weakness.

48:16.978 --> 48:18.343
Thanks for the tip.

48:18.379 --> 48:21.576
These things
are state of the art.

48:21.649 --> 48:24.584
Faith in yourself
is all you need.

48:24.619 --> 48:26.484
I say that to all of you.

48:30.592 --> 48:32.890
I'll try to open a portal
to Outworld.

48:32.928 --> 48:34.190
Follow me!

49:03.093 --> 49:04.958
My powers are leaving me.

49:07.964 --> 49:11.832
Who does he think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?

49:15.040 --> 49:17.907
Destroy... everything!

49:37.997 --> 49:39.897
Whenever you're ready.

50:01.288 --> 50:02.846
Come on.

50:09.997 --> 50:12.090
That was fun.

50:12.133 --> 50:16.229
They have taken the bait
and fallen into our trap.

50:16.270 --> 50:18.431
Proceed as planned.

50:18.473 --> 50:20.805
I will await your arrival
in Outworld.

50:30.719 --> 50:33.153
My skin is burning,
but I'm freezing inside.

50:33.188 --> 50:34.815
Feels like I got microwaved.

50:34.890 --> 50:36.551
You never get used to that.

50:37.327 --> 50:39.261
Is that what I think it is?

50:40.462 --> 50:42.589
The realms are merging.

50:42.632 --> 50:45.533
This will continue unless
Kahn's portals are closed.

50:46.268 --> 50:48.361
Time is against us.

50:48.404 --> 50:51.134
- People in their cars...
- Torn between realms.

50:51.174 --> 50:53.005
It's like a nightmare.

50:53.043 --> 50:54.704
We have to stop this.

50:56.079 --> 50:58.707
To do that,
we must rescue Kitana.

51:00.084 --> 51:02.951
I know Kahn took Kitana
to his fortress.

51:02.986 --> 51:05.477
Hold up. Kahn?

51:05.523 --> 51:07.081
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude?

51:07.124 --> 51:09.149
You want to check out his crib?

51:09.227 --> 51:11.195
No way.

51:11.228 --> 51:13.287
I ain't going
on no suicide mission.

51:15.033 --> 51:16.364
Jax is right.

51:16.401 --> 51:18.835
That's probably
what Kahn wants us to do.

51:20.172 --> 51:22.106
There is a secret passageway.

51:22.841 --> 51:24.706
I used it to escape.

51:43.763 --> 51:46.323
How could you believe
the ruination of the temple...

51:46.399 --> 51:48.629
would not jeopardize our plan?

51:48.669 --> 51:50.899
It was necessary
to convince the mortals...

51:50.937 --> 51:53.098
their only hope lie in Outworld.

51:53.140 --> 51:57.201
You seem confident that Sindel
will capture them in your trap.

51:57.244 --> 52:00.042
I promise you, on my soul.

52:00.080 --> 52:03.379
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.

52:03.418 --> 52:05.716
You will be proud.

52:05.753 --> 52:07.914
Know this...

52:07.955 --> 52:11.721
I will take your soul myself
if you fail.

52:14.830 --> 52:18.197
I will rally
the extermination squads...

52:18.233 --> 52:21.259
and prepare for victory.

52:21.337 --> 52:24.272
The merger
will soon be complete.

52:24.305 --> 52:28.036
All your friends will be dead.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.680
This must have been Edenia.

52:45.762 --> 52:47.457
The royal family's temple.

52:47.531 --> 52:49.158
Kitana said I'd find it here.

52:54.805 --> 52:57.000
She's having a bad hair day.

53:10.088 --> 53:11.851
They must have followed us.

53:16.094 --> 53:20.087
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.

53:20.133 --> 53:23.000
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.

53:23.068 --> 53:26.196
- I'll take care of her.
- I'll rescue Kitana.

54:51.228 --> 54:54.595
Something finally went right.
We won.

54:54.632 --> 54:56.600
Who finished off Sindel?

54:56.634 --> 55:00.400
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.

55:01.406 --> 55:03.897
Maybe she came in handy
after all.

55:07.245 --> 55:13.707
You are witness to the dawning
of mankind's final day!

55:13.752 --> 55:17.711
The two realms will be one!

55:20.627 --> 55:25.030
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...

55:25.063 --> 55:28.089
and failed to stop us.

55:28.134 --> 55:32.537
Bring Rayden and his mortals
to bow at my feet.

55:32.572 --> 55:38.568
With their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...

55:38.646 --> 55:43.049
of the greatest army
in existence!

57:06.739 --> 57:08.707
It's a trap. Leave!

57:41.142 --> 57:42.609
Up there!

59:13.939 --> 59:15.804
The date's over.

59:36.463 --> 59:37.623
Only your love...

59:38.466 --> 59:40.457
can reunite her body and soul.

59:40.968 --> 59:42.128
Kitana...

59:42.471 --> 59:44.268
your love...

59:44.305 --> 59:46.773
can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...

59:46.808 --> 59:48.776
and close his portals to earth.

01:00:23.247 --> 01:00:25.977
I have prayed for the day...

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:27.981
when our love...

01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.815
will bring us together again.

01:00:41.465 --> 01:00:44.332
I have never loved you.

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:47.827
With such a pathetic child,
what reason was there to love?

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:50.539
I knew it could not be true.

01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:52.173
It cannot be.

01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:56.477
But it can... and it is.

01:00:56.516 --> 01:00:59.883
And you are powerless...

01:00:59.919 --> 01:01:02.012
Thunder God.

01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:09.923
It's over.

01:01:09.997 --> 01:01:11.589
You fools.

01:01:11.665 --> 01:01:13.257
You've been tricked.

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:15.198
The legend was a lie.

01:01:15.235 --> 01:01:18.033
Kahn's portals stay open.

01:01:18.071 --> 01:01:21.529
Now the merger
is nearly complete.

01:01:21.576 --> 01:01:23.100
How could you do this?

01:01:25.445 --> 01:01:27.504
It was so easy.

01:01:29.417 --> 01:01:31.476
You will die for this, Jade.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:10.992
That's it.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.325
We trusted you, man.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.727
And what happens?

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:15.754
You take us
on a wild goose chase.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.825
I don't understand.

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:20.200
You were advised
by the other gods.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.305
The gods must've lied to me.

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.967
Forget your gods...

01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:25.305
and immortals...

01:02:25.343 --> 01:02:27.140
and all that junk!

01:02:27.179 --> 01:02:30.478
The only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.948
Nobody else, not even Rayden.

01:02:32.985 --> 01:02:34.111
Don't you understand?

01:02:34.152 --> 01:02:37.451
By leading us here,
he is mortal now like you.

01:02:37.489 --> 01:02:39.582
All his powers
have been sacrificed.

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:40.751
That's even worse.

01:02:40.792 --> 01:02:42.589
How do we stop Kahn now?

01:02:42.629 --> 01:02:44.654
There's more to this than Kahn.

01:02:45.831 --> 01:02:48.698
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals,

01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:50.736
then Kahn
has a higher allegiance.

01:02:52.204 --> 01:02:53.398
Wait a second.

01:02:53.873 --> 01:02:55.864
That tattoo.
I've seen it before.

01:02:56.242 --> 01:02:58.005
On a robot and a woman.

01:02:58.044 --> 01:02:59.841
They both tried to kill me.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.871
And both of them
worked for Kahn.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.288
This tattoo is a family crest...

01:03:08.788 --> 01:03:10.779
bestowed only to my bloodline.

01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.559
It is a permanent mark...

01:03:13.594 --> 01:03:15.755
that allows safe passage
through the portals...

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:17.856
for the bearer
and his passengers.

01:03:17.898 --> 01:03:21.095
Did the tattoos you saw
flee the fighter upon death?

01:03:21.169 --> 01:03:22.727
Like a bat out of hell.

01:03:22.804 --> 01:03:24.431
Temporary passes.

01:03:24.506 --> 01:03:26.337
The did not share my bloodline.

01:03:26.374 --> 01:03:28.569
But if it's your family crest...

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:30.771
how can Kahn's side
have it, too?

01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:33.504
My father is an Elder God.

01:03:34.015 --> 01:03:36.279
And only they can bestow
such a marking.

01:03:36.851 --> 01:03:38.944
Your dad's an Elder God?

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:45.988
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.

01:03:48.966 --> 01:03:51.161
If your father's an Elder God...

01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:54.128
what does that make Kahn?

01:04:02.212 --> 01:04:03.907
Shao-Kahn is my brother.

01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:18.428
It was not my fault.

01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:20.522
I did everything you ordered.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.931
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.

01:04:22.967 --> 01:04:26.198
If they escaped,
then you failed me!

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:28.603
We could never
have stopped them alone.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.937
Listen to her.

01:04:30.008 --> 01:04:31.475
She speaks the truth.

01:04:31.542 --> 01:04:33.407
We would've died trying.

01:04:33.445 --> 01:04:34.844
You.

01:04:35.848 --> 01:04:37.679
You are already dead!

01:04:39.852 --> 01:04:40.876
And you...

01:04:42.021 --> 01:04:43.511
will be soon.

01:04:57.504 --> 01:05:00.302
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.

01:05:00.341 --> 01:05:03.139
Prepare for Rayden to make
one last attack.

01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:05.700
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.611
I am to be feared!

01:05:07.648 --> 01:05:09.013
If you fail me...

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:11.610
I will feed
your rotting corpse...

01:05:11.652 --> 01:05:12.983
to the worms!

01:05:17.392 --> 01:05:20.953
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile...

01:05:20.996 --> 01:05:23.624
appears to be most tenuous.

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:29.002
Now your failure
will be my opportunity.

01:05:36.178 --> 01:05:38.840
Man, you got
one dysfunctional family.

01:05:38.915 --> 01:05:41.315
Years ago,
my father decreed...

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:44.786
his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...

01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:47.721
to kill his own brother
in battle if necessary.

01:05:48.926 --> 01:05:50.689
I beat my brother...

01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:53.385
but I could not kill him.

01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:55.329
Only one thing is certain.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.933
Kahn must die.

01:05:58.836 --> 01:06:00.360
This time you'll kill him.

01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:02.528
I could not then.

01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:04.872
I cannot now.

01:06:04.909 --> 01:06:07.434
So what do we do?

01:06:07.479 --> 01:06:09.538
You will do your best.

01:06:09.947 --> 01:06:11.744
It is all that can be expected.

01:06:11.816 --> 01:06:13.408
I will pray for you all.

01:06:16.821 --> 01:06:18.083
Listen to me.

01:06:18.123 --> 01:06:19.784
Liu is our only hope.

01:06:22.828 --> 01:06:24.523
I want to fight Kahn...

01:06:24.562 --> 01:06:26.291
but I may not be ready.

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:28.231
You must believe in yourself.

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:30.163
We believe in you.

01:07:09.777 --> 01:07:10.937
My home.

01:07:12.781 --> 01:07:14.942
The Temple
of the Order of Light.

01:07:15.316 --> 01:07:16.613
Your family.

01:07:17.986 --> 01:07:19.954
There's so little time left.

01:07:20.989 --> 01:07:22.957
Whatever time we have...

01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:24.458
we must use well.

01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:27.822
Are we really ready to die here?

01:07:30.165 --> 01:07:31.325
If we die...

01:07:32.335 --> 01:07:33.825
we will die in battle.

01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:36.631
Together.

01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:39.229
Prepare for final battle!

01:08:46.712 --> 01:08:48.647
So good of you to join us, son.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.787
In under one hour, the merger
of realms will be complete.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.812
Father, you alone
have the power to end this.

01:08:56.858 --> 01:08:57.825
Stop!

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:00.987
I do not want to remember you
this weak!

01:09:01.062 --> 01:09:03.462
It is not weak to value life!

01:09:05.466 --> 01:09:09.528
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.

01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:13.206
To rule all realms
with your family.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.679
They are my family.

01:09:20.616 --> 01:09:24.712
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race!

01:09:24.752 --> 01:09:25.742
Finish him!

01:09:26.956 --> 01:09:28.947
You should have killed me...

01:09:30.627 --> 01:09:32.618
when you had the chance...

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:34.430
brother.

01:09:34.831 --> 01:09:37.162
My brother died a long time ago.

01:09:38.002 --> 01:09:39.469
His heart, anyway.

01:09:53.884 --> 01:09:55.374
I win...

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.819
brother.

01:10:12.538 --> 01:10:14.870
You cannot die.

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:18.033
I am proud to die...

01:10:19.045 --> 01:10:20.205
a mortal.

01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:24.843
Like you.

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:50.234
This is the beginning
of the end!

01:10:51.079 --> 01:10:53.047
Show them the way...

01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:55.049
to oblivion!

01:10:58.086 --> 01:10:59.610
Mr. Ed is mine.

01:11:03.558 --> 01:11:04.786
I'll take my mother.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.730
Leftovers are fine with me.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.868
I'll make you eat that thing.

01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:34.346
I can't take
too much more of this.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.994
Is that all you got?

01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:51.641
Is that any way
to treat your mother?

01:11:51.676 --> 01:11:53.143
My mother's dead.

01:11:53.177 --> 01:11:55.111
As soon will be her daughter.

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:18.701
That just leaves
you and me, Kahn.

01:12:55.378 --> 01:12:57.710
Pathetic and weak.

01:12:57.746 --> 01:13:00.943
Clearly Rayden has molded you
in his image.

01:13:34.552 --> 01:13:36.179
Without your weapons...

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.051
you are no match for Motaro.

01:14:42.223 --> 01:14:44.555
Jax, help!

01:14:48.196 --> 01:14:50.187
I got everything I need
right here!

01:15:22.634 --> 01:15:23.828
Help!

01:15:25.302 --> 01:15:26.326
Get off her.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.211
Get down, Sonya.

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:41.919
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:44.353
So you finally got
your confidence back, huh?

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:46.221
Finally asked for help, huh?

01:15:47.059 --> 01:15:48.526
Whatever you are...

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.858
you will live
to see the end of Kahn...

01:15:50.896 --> 01:15:53.558
to give my mother's soul peace.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.638
Face it, Liu Kang.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.813
You will fail!

01:16:17.358 --> 01:16:19.986
I can feel...

01:16:30.471 --> 01:16:32.063
Now I done seen everything.

01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:36.809
Impressive.

01:16:36.844 --> 01:16:38.505
You've come prepared.

01:16:39.081 --> 01:16:41.447
But not good enough.

01:17:53.626 --> 01:17:55.093
Your blood flows, Kahn.

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.392
Just like the blood of a mortal.

01:18:00.233 --> 01:18:01.723
How can this be?

01:18:02.402 --> 01:18:05.132
I warned you
there would be consequences...

01:18:05.172 --> 01:18:07.470
for breaking the sacred rules.

01:18:07.507 --> 01:18:09.805
But I did not expect this.

01:18:09.843 --> 01:18:11.970
Must I do everything for you?

01:18:33.535 --> 01:18:36.003
The fate of the universe...

01:18:36.038 --> 01:18:39.337
will be decided as it should be.

01:18:39.375 --> 01:18:42.173
In Mortal Kombat.

01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:13.169
Nothing can alter your destiny,
nor mine!

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.310
I can, and I will!

01:21:25.717 --> 01:21:28.049
That was the longest week
of my life.

01:21:28.087 --> 01:21:29.679
Oh, come on, Jax.

01:21:29.722 --> 01:21:30.848
Could've been worse.

01:21:30.889 --> 01:21:33.084
Could've been the last week
of our lives.

01:21:33.125 --> 01:21:34.558
I guess that's right.

01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:38.724
What's up with that?

01:22:01.123 --> 01:22:02.215
Was I dead?

01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:04.384
It is only right
that Shinnok's son...

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:07.986
be allowed to take his place
in the Eternal Palace.

01:22:08.029 --> 01:22:10.361
You've become one of us.

01:22:19.574 --> 01:22:21.906
I will never forget
this moment, Liu.

01:22:29.085 --> 01:22:31.417
You've all made me very proud.

01:22:35.391 --> 01:22:36.881
I will be watching you...

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.050
so stay out of trouble.

01:22:41.398 --> 01:22:42.422
And remember...

01:22:43.399 --> 01:22:44.866
be there for one another.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.867
You're a family now.
