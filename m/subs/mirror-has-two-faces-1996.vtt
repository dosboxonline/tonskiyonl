WEBVTT

01:23.341 --> 01:26.491
You can see that F
of X equals E to Y...

01:26.649 --> 01:31.510
Times E to the X,
which is what we were trying to prove.

01:31.824 --> 01:35.003
Notice the elegance of the proof.

01:35.108 --> 01:36.946
It's beautiful!

01:37.029 --> 01:39.937
It actually reminds me
of a quote by Socrates,

01:40.021 --> 01:41.863
'If measure and symmetry are absent

01:41.947 --> 01:44.202
'from any composition in any degree,

01:44.341 --> 01:48.106
'the ruin awaits both the
ingredients and the composition.'

01:49.139 --> 01:51.923
'Measure and symmetry are beauty,
and...

01:52.765 --> 01:54.085
virtue the world over.'

01:59.324 --> 02:01.432
He's cute. Do you think he's straight?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.683
Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay.

02:05.498 --> 02:06.083
Oh.

02:06.435 --> 02:09.878
-Is it 5:15? Is my watch correct?
-Yes, it is.

02:10.104 --> 02:10.786
Uh...

02:11.974 --> 02:13.642
Thank you. Uh...

02:15.104 --> 02:18.401
I'm releasing you a half
hour early today. I have...

02:19.318 --> 02:20.699
an appointment.

02:22.199 --> 02:25.004
I'm giving a lecture
on my new book tonight.

02:25.088 --> 02:27.224
If people are interested,
please see me.

02:28.568 --> 02:29.993
Okay. Um...

02:31.069 --> 02:31.921
Thank you.

02:41.305 --> 02:42.683
Whoo!

02:51.864 --> 02:52.697
Mmm.

02:53.559 --> 02:56.390
Rose, get that mask off your face.
It's been 15 minutes.

02:56.473 --> 02:57.869
It'll clog your pores.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.143
You're Donna be late. It's almost 7:00.

03:01.226 --> 03:02.431
All right, all right.

03:10.601 --> 03:12.428
Ah! You stupid bum!

03:12.511 --> 03:15.356
$3 million a year! For what? For what?

03:15.855 --> 03:17.892
Come on. Come on, just one more out.

03:45.366 --> 03:46.530
Barry Neufeld.

03:46.975 --> 03:48.902
Hi, Barry. It's Rose.

03:49.311 --> 03:50.332
Hi...

03:51.336 --> 03:52.544
Oh, no, not again.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.780
Uh, I think it's an allergic reaction

03:54.863 --> 03:56.674
to something I ate, you know.

03:56.934 --> 03:58.282
Come on, come on, come on.

03:58.658 --> 04:01.820
My throat's starting to close up. Oh!

04:01.903 --> 04:03.303
It sounds like you're dying.

04:03.407 --> 04:06.020
Rose, it's the third time this month.

04:06.103 --> 04:07.714
Are you sure you're not allergic to me?

04:07.797 --> 04:09.689
Barry, please don't think that.

04:09.772 --> 04:10.975
That's a terrible thing to think!

04:11.058 --> 04:12.730
I'm Donna be blacklisted
at every restaurant

04:12.814 --> 04:14.890
in Manhattan for not
keeping reservations.

04:14.974 --> 04:16.957
Why don't you call me next week, okay?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.793
If you still want to.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.261
-Sure. Feel better.
-Thank you.

04:22.878 --> 04:24.450
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:41.297 --> 04:42.723
Think I should start with a joke?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.238
Oh, you're serious?

04:45.321 --> 04:47.255
No, I don't think so.
There's not enough time.

04:47.372 --> 04:50.197
-For what?
-For you to develop a sense of humour.

04:52.457 --> 04:54.491
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

04:54.737 --> 04:57.510
the author of Absolute Truth,

04:58.140 --> 05:02.245
Columbia's very own
Professor Gregory Larkin.

05:02.515 --> 05:03.949
You're going to be fine.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.076
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.700
I'm honoured by this warm
and gracious welcome.

05:16.527 --> 05:19.593
As I stand here at
the end of a journey,

05:19.824 --> 05:22.211
I'm reminded of something
Descartes once said,

05:22.478 --> 05:24.297
'Whether I am awake or asleep,

05:24.453 --> 05:26.566
two and three will always make five.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.699
'A square can never have
more than four sides.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.350
'It does not seem possible that truths'

05:32.433 --> 05:36.077
'so clear and apparent can be
suspected of any uncertainty.'

05:36.889 --> 05:38.308
Uh, this book..

05:39.464 --> 05:43.462
has taken me over 14 years to write.

05:44.221 --> 05:46.029
It is not without a little sadness

05:46.112 --> 05:49.259
that I say goodbye to it
consuming my days and nights.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.127
And nights... Um...

05:55.786 --> 05:57.017
And so...

05:59.823 --> 06:01.511
And as I stand here...

06:04.715 --> 06:08.243
And so, in coming up... Summing up...

06:08.906 --> 06:09.527
Uh...

06:11.176 --> 06:13.902
Excuse me, I'm feeling a little dizzy.
Uh...

06:14.399 --> 06:15.232
Uh...

06:17.435 --> 06:19.644
I thought it would feel differently.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.660
I thought I would know more. I don't.

06:23.705 --> 06:25.047
I don't know anything,

06:25.781 --> 06:26.614
really.

06:27.708 --> 06:31.579
Thank you all for coming.

06:37.982 --> 06:38.689
Thanks. Thank you.

06:39.783 --> 06:41.063
Oh, God. What did I say?

06:41.180 --> 06:42.160
It was fine,

06:42.243 --> 06:44.743
although I'd think twice
about doing volunteer work

06:44.826 --> 06:46.186
for a suicide hotline.

06:46.269 --> 06:48.897
You were doing okay
until Candice walked in.

06:49.314 --> 06:51.651
Don't start, Henry.
I just forgot to eat.

06:51.734 --> 06:53.834
You should never drink
on an empty stomach.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.761
Listen, it's perfectly natural.
She left you what, a year ago?

06:58.263 --> 07:00.374
Thank God Candy left when she did,

07:00.458 --> 07:01.727
or I never would have finished the book.

07:01.958 --> 07:04.742
Thank god Rebecca left,
and Catherine and Alison.

07:04.913 --> 07:06.869
You're the only guy I know who can't
have sex

07:06.953 --> 07:07.765
and chew gum at the same time.

07:07.848 --> 07:08.855
Why does everything
have to be about sex?

07:08.938 --> 07:10.089
Because everything is about sex.

07:10.172 --> 07:12.672
When I'm with someone,
when I'm involved with them,

07:12.755 --> 07:15.625
I tend to get a little sidetracked,
that's all.

07:16.114 --> 07:20.120
Greg, you call 14 years to write
a book a little sidetracked?

07:20.341 --> 07:21.892
I bet she's still out there.

07:22.119 --> 07:24.768
-If I know Candice, she's out there.
-No, no, no. Henry!

07:27.408 --> 07:30.973
She's out there. Come on,
face her like a grown-up. Come on.

07:31.056 --> 07:32.456
Wait, do me a favour, Henry.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.660
Don't let me go home with her.
Say we're going out to dinner.

07:35.984 --> 07:37.541
We are.
It may seem odd not to invite...

07:37.624 --> 07:40.330
Please, Henry,
just don't let me go home with her.

07:40.435 --> 07:42.251
All right. All right.

07:44.581 --> 07:45.471
Are you all right?

07:48.265 --> 07:50.875
It was that stupid wine.
Hello, Candice.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.089
Hi.

07:52.243 --> 07:54.198
-You look great.
-Thanks.

07:54.371 --> 07:55.605
I hope you don't mind me

07:55.689 --> 07:57.304
just showing up like
this on your big night.

07:57.485 --> 07:58.073
No.

07:58.277 --> 08:02.577
It's just that I've been thinking
so much about you lately.

08:03.034 --> 08:04.877
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

08:06.489 --> 08:10.205
-Do you want to go get a drink?
-No, I'd better not.

08:10.288 --> 08:13.309
-Want to grab a bite to eat?
-No, I'm not hungry.

08:14.191 --> 08:16.849
-Want me to take you home?
-Okay.

08:18.261 --> 08:21.151
-Good to see you, Henry.
-But Greg, you said...

08:21.235 --> 08:22.246
Bye, Henry.

08:25.633 --> 08:28.853
-Candy, don't leave.
-That was great.

08:28.937 --> 08:30.175
I thought you were Donna stay.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.987
Well, we're done. Is my shoe here?

08:32.077 --> 08:33.553
Well,
Candy, I still have feelings for you.

08:33.717 --> 08:35.094
But I dumped you for another man.

08:35.178 --> 08:36.840
How could you still
have feelings for me?

08:36.924 --> 08:41.301
-Besides, I'm still sort of with Paul.
-I thought that was over.

08:41.695 --> 08:42.897
Well, he was cheating on me.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.443
I guess I wanted to
feel better about myself

08:45.526 --> 08:46.967
before I see him tomorrow night.

08:47.283 --> 08:49.110
That's why you're here?

08:50.645 --> 08:51.663
Well, yeah.

08:52.709 --> 08:56.240
Look, you were always such a nice guy,
but let's face it,

08:56.993 --> 08:59.544
we have nothing in common except sex

08:59.838 --> 09:01.693
and the fact that you idolize me.

09:02.330 --> 09:05.858
I... I really do care for you. Really.

09:06.260 --> 09:08.013
I just can't wind up with you.

09:08.435 --> 09:10.725
Can I call you sometime?

09:12.745 --> 09:13.917
What for?

09:21.881 --> 09:24.922
Rose, are you going, or what?
No, I cancelled.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.810
-So, what do you want to do for dinner?
-What?

09:28.991 --> 09:31.176
Why don't you make that
pasta with the artichokes?

09:31.429 --> 09:33.013
Then maybe later, we can figure out

09:33.096 --> 09:35.074
what to do with your hair,
for Claire's wedding.

09:42.122 --> 09:43.483
What is this?

09:46.340 --> 09:48.738
Look at this. I wish I could escape.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.657
The mating ritual is both speedy

09:51.740 --> 09:53.842
and violent for these
passionate insects,

09:53.996 --> 09:56.954
with the lesser male often
covering the larger female.

09:58.977 --> 10:00.539
If unsuccessful in mounting,

10:00.623 --> 10:04.178
the male is often eaten by
the female during copulation.

10:06.232 --> 10:10.237
We're the girls of 1-400-Hot-Talk.

10:12.108 --> 10:16.176
Brianna, Tina, Marla and me, Felicia.

10:16.385 --> 10:20.784
Anything you want to talk about,
call me.

10:20.868 --> 10:23.686
Call me. Call me.

10:26.088 --> 10:29.122
I don't really know where to begin.

10:29.715 --> 10:31.493
Are you lonely tonight, darling?

10:32.085 --> 10:32.702
Yeah.

10:34.240 --> 10:39.173
-So am I. What are you wearing?
-Nothing special.

10:40.019 --> 10:42.041
Felicia, can I ask you a question?

10:42.125 --> 10:44.982
Want to know what I'm wearing?
Just wearing a towel.

10:45.408 --> 10:49.892
I was drying myself off after
a hot shower when you called...

10:50.054 --> 10:52.835
-Why do women leave?
-What?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.108
Why do women leave?

10:55.191 --> 10:56.848
Especially beautiful women.

10:57.293 --> 10:59.080
I can't go through this any more.

10:59.628 --> 11:02.591
Life is very complex.

11:03.110 --> 11:05.459
There are no guarantees.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.232
Why should that be?

11:07.316 --> 11:10.386
The mathematical world
is completely rational,

11:10.469 --> 11:11.750
uncomplicated by sex.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.333
You think too much, hon.

11:13.666 --> 11:14.400
Felicia, I...

11:14.485 --> 11:16.358
Don't you
want to know how big my tits are?

11:16.759 --> 11:22.050
No! I just want to share
my life with someone.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.733
Someone I'm not sexually attracted to.

11:25.497 --> 11:26.320
What?

11:26.500 --> 11:29.732
How can two people come
together for what's a

11:30.023 --> 11:33.340
lasting and substantial,
mutual respect, genuine affection,

11:33.558 --> 11:36.344
in a world that's run by ad
agencies selling great sex?

11:36.428 --> 11:38.664
Take out your own ad, I guess.

11:39.936 --> 11:42.790
-An ad?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.250
Look at me.
I'm a grown woman wearing a prom dress.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.482
You are not. You look adorable.

12:20.566 --> 12:22.914
Adorable? I look like an
over-the-hill Barbie doll.

12:22.998 --> 12:24.668
It doesn't fit right, it's too tight.

12:25.006 --> 12:25.724
Too many Sno Balls.

12:25.887 --> 12:28.416
Why didn't you pick out
something looser in my colour?

12:28.523 --> 12:30.066
Because maids of honour
don't wear black.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.688
You know, it would help if you
fixed yourself up a little bit.

12:32.771 --> 12:33.824
Why don't you wear some make-up?

12:33.908 --> 12:35.191
I am wearing make-up.

12:37.183 --> 12:37.733
Let's go.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.647
And your hair looks good today.
I like it, the curls work.

12:40.873 --> 12:41.807
Why don't you get a perm?

12:41.891 --> 12:44.463
I tried that once.
I looked like Shirley Temple on crack.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.410
Where the hell is she?
I'm Donna kill her!

12:47.584 --> 12:49.224
I knew she would pull
something like this.

12:49.308 --> 12:51.392
She can't stand the
fact that I'm the one

12:51.475 --> 12:52.856
getting all the attention today.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.911
We should've had her
committed when she turned 60.

12:55.116 --> 12:58.547
Claire, you can't have someone
committed for excessive vanity.

12:58.631 --> 12:59.818
Thank you, Rose.

13:00.425 --> 13:03.376
How wonderful to have two
compassionate daughters.

13:04.298 --> 13:06.189
I thought you were going
to wear make-up today.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.329
-I am wearing make-up.
-Well?

13:08.413 --> 13:09.392
Oh, my God.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.319
What the hell are you wearing?

13:13.578 --> 13:15.528
This happens to be an imitation Scaasi.

13:15.710 --> 13:18.337
You're the mother of the bride,
not the opening act.

13:18.569 --> 13:20.046
Fine, I'll go home and change.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.407
Oh, stop it. We're late already.
The priest is sweating.

13:24.047 --> 13:26.839
All celibates sweat, dear.
If they didn't, they'd explode.

13:26.923 --> 13:27.745
Come on, let's go.

13:27.924 --> 13:29.924
I just went to buy
myself a little snack.

13:30.191 --> 13:33.665
I can't sit through this without
eating something, I'll pass out.

13:33.749 --> 13:37.093
-It'll only take 45 minutes.
-It'll feel like two hours.

13:37.386 --> 13:38.602
Not to mention that you're marrying

13:38.685 --> 13:40.129
outside your faith and on the Sabbath...

13:40.213 --> 13:41.861
Mother,
the only thing you ever taught me

13:41.945 --> 13:44.371
about the Sabbath is that
Bergdorf's wouldn't be as crowded.

13:44.455 --> 13:46.632
-And you listen to me...
-Take it easy, Claire.

13:47.002 --> 13:48.020
I want you to get up there,

13:48.104 --> 13:50.124
and I want you to
remember today is my day.

13:50.605 --> 13:52.163
And if you don't behave yourself,
I'm Donna

13:52.247 --> 13:54.740
have your birth certificate
blown up as a Christmas card.

13:55.759 --> 13:57.824
I should have never
encouraged you to speak.

14:09.911 --> 14:13.183
Maybe she'll look back and
turn into a pillar of salt.

14:18.577 --> 14:20.001
Alex looks nervous.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.173
Oh God,
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

14:25.771 --> 14:26.888
I think you are.

14:29.447 --> 14:32.128
Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is about to get started.

14:32.212 --> 14:34.394
The dance floor is all yours!

14:35.835 --> 14:38.790
Okay, girls, lick your lips.
Come in close. Come in close.

14:43.201 --> 14:45.169
It's good to see ya.
Tell Claire I'm looking for her.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.720
Your husband's a lucky guy.

14:48.703 --> 14:49.994
-Mmm.
-Oh!

14:51.097 --> 14:54.556
Waiter! Can we have more dressing?

14:54.890 --> 14:56.482
We were separated at birth.

14:56.576 --> 14:58.328
Two more drinks when you get a chance,
please.

14:58.412 --> 15:02.186
That would be nice.
This looks delicious. I'm so happy.

15:08.103 --> 15:09.206
I can't believe he's married.

15:09.289 --> 15:11.289
I can't believe he
chose Claire over you.

15:11.372 --> 15:14.005
I can.
I told you not to introduce them.

15:14.089 --> 15:16.459
Well, she already had a husband.
I thought it was safe.

15:19.581 --> 15:22.656
-How are you handling all this?
-I've learned my lesson.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.277
No more fantasies
about good-looking men.

15:25.361 --> 15:27.913
You never know. There's a guy
out there somewhere for you.

15:27.997 --> 15:30.095
Oh, yeah? Who? Barry Neufeld?

15:30.797 --> 15:32.425
So what's wrong with him?

15:34.613 --> 15:36.552
Besides the fact he looks like Gumpy,

15:36.635 --> 15:38.287
and he irritates the shit out of you?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.885
-Gumby, not Gumpy.
-Gumby.

15:43.764 --> 15:45.835
Why should that matter?
I'm no great prize, either.

15:45.919 --> 15:49.577
Don't say that. You are a terrific
person and a great teacher.

15:49.684 --> 15:52.457
The truth is,
I think I've reached the point.

15:52.627 --> 15:53.401
What point?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.349
The point that you know
you'll never get married.

15:55.432 --> 15:59.487
Married?
What's marriage anyway? Oh! Come on.

15:59.571 --> 16:02.495
A ring,
a contract, fighting and compromising.

16:03.364 --> 16:04.789
No, it can be more than that.

16:05.987 --> 16:08.792
I'll tell you what I envy
about people in love.

16:08.876 --> 16:09.526
Yeah.

16:10.362 --> 16:14.763
I'd love it if someone really knew me.

16:15.568 --> 16:17.768
What I like. What I'm afraid of.

16:18.891 --> 16:20.482
What kind of toothpaste I use.

16:22.701 --> 16:25.838
I think that would really be wonderful.

16:26.381 --> 16:31.300
Hey, hey, hey, sister-in-law,
you having a good time here?

16:31.532 --> 16:32.098
Yeah.

16:32.182 --> 16:34.062
Ladies and gentlemen,
in honour of the bride...

16:34.378 --> 16:35.794
-Have you seen Claire?
-No.

16:36.189 --> 16:38.910
-I can't find her anywhere.
-I'll go find her for you.

16:38.994 --> 16:40.154
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

16:40.264 --> 16:41.914
You look beautiful tonight, by the way.

16:41.998 --> 16:42.473
Right.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.443
No.
I'm not just saying that. You really do.

16:44.527 --> 16:46.237
-You really look...
-I heard you.

16:48.475 --> 16:52.171
Why don't you have some coffee?
I'll go find Claire.

16:55.570 --> 16:58.804
Claire, where have you been?
Alex is looking for you.

16:58.888 --> 17:01.189
-Oh, brother, it's starting already?
-Come on.

17:01.455 --> 17:04.846
How could you do this?
I may never forgive you.

17:04.930 --> 17:06.959
I may never forgive you.
That's another story.

17:34.562 --> 17:35.548
Hmm.

17:47.636 --> 17:48.699
Hmm.

17:49.517 --> 17:51.135
Yes.

17:51.254 --> 17:53.883
Ah. Yes.

17:58.057 --> 18:02.165
-Yes!
-I'm Professor Gregory Larkin.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.655
I'm calling about the response to my ad.

18:06.354 --> 18:07.553
Is this Professor Morgan?

18:07.966 --> 18:09.856
No, this is her sister.

18:09.986 --> 18:11.952
Rose doesn't even know
I answered the ad.

18:12.035 --> 18:14.257
Well,
then maybe we shouldn't be talking.

18:14.377 --> 18:16.460
No! Please, it's just that Rose

18:16.543 --> 18:17.892
would never answer an ad herself.

18:17.976 --> 18:21.100
I mean, some of these guys
are such creeps and losers.

18:21.956 --> 18:24.009
But when it said you taught at Columbia,

18:24.093 --> 18:26.371
something just clicked inside.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.380
-You have seen her picture, right?
-Yes.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.326
-And?
-And what?

18:37.330 --> 18:38.455
Nothing. Great.

18:49.468 --> 18:50.578
Make way, please.

19:03.078 --> 19:05.546
So. This is the scene at
my sister's wedding. Right?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.189
There she is getting drunk,

19:07.437 --> 19:11.136
regretting she ever got married,
for the third time, mind you.

19:11.924 --> 19:15.102
My mother is so jealous,
she's sprouting snakes from her hair.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.423
And I'm thinking, 'This is perfect.'

19:17.790 --> 19:21.770
We've got three feminine archetypes,
the divine whore,

19:22.910 --> 19:28.018
Medusa, and me.
Who am I? What archetype? Trevor.

19:28.575 --> 19:32.965
-The Virgin Mary?
-Thanks a lot, Trevor.

19:33.592 --> 19:36.003
No, the faithful handmaiden.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.229
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

19:40.362 --> 19:43.539
It does prove,
however, what Jung said all along,

19:43.623 --> 19:45.633
that myths and archetypes are alive,

19:45.716 --> 19:47.624
and well and living in my apartment.

19:49.754 --> 19:55.176
As I stood at the altar beside
my sister and her husband-to-be,

19:55.941 --> 20:00.033
it struck me that this ritual
called a wedding ceremony

20:00.593 --> 20:03.217
is really just the last
scene of a fairy tale.

20:03.529 --> 20:05.527
They never tell you what happens after.

20:05.947 --> 20:08.273
They never tell you that
Cinderella drove the prince crazy

20:08.357 --> 20:10.675
with her obsessive need
to clean the castle.

20:12.575 --> 20:14.275
But she missed her day job, right?

20:14.578 --> 20:16.960
No,
they don't tell us what happens after,

20:17.044 --> 20:18.931
because there is no after.

20:19.673 --> 20:24.236
The be-all and the end-all
of romantic love was... Mike?

20:24.570 --> 20:25.217
Sex?

20:25.310 --> 20:29.491
Mike! Mike! Mike!
Sex on the brain, Mike.

20:29.719 --> 20:30.374
Marriage.

20:30.457 --> 20:33.700
Marriage, that's right.
But it wasn't always like that.

20:33.993 --> 20:36.427
Around the 12th century, there was
a notion known as

20:36.511 --> 20:37.609
'courtly love, '

20:37.735 --> 20:39.505
where love had nothing
to do with marriage

20:39.589 --> 20:41.069
and nothing to do with sex.

20:41.376 --> 20:44.724
In most cases, it was defined
as a passionate relationship

20:44.808 --> 20:47.374
between a knight and a lady of the
court,

20:47.458 --> 20:48.680
who was already married.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.132
And so,
they could never consummate their love.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.209
In this way,
they would have to rise above

20:55.293 --> 20:58.314
your ordinary,
you know, 'going to the bathroom

20:58.398 --> 21:00.193
in front of each other' kind of love,
right?

21:00.518 --> 21:05.196
And they would go after
something more divine.

21:06.162 --> 21:08.871
They took sex out of the equation,

21:09.425 --> 21:12.478
and what was left was a union of souls.

21:12.561 --> 21:18.016
Think of this.
Sex was always the fatal love potion.

21:18.209 --> 21:19.931
Look at the literature of the time.

21:20.015 --> 21:22.221
Lancelot and Guinevere.
Tristan and Isolde.

21:22.305 --> 21:26.876
All consummation could lead to
was madness, despair or death.

21:27.923 --> 21:30.560
Clinical experts,
scholars and my Aunt Esther

21:30.872 --> 21:32.299
are united in the belief

21:32.383 --> 21:35.597
that true love has
spiritual dimensions,

21:35.829 --> 21:37.765
while romantic love
is nothing but a lie.

21:37.848 --> 21:39.991
An illusion, a modern myth.

21:40.075 --> 21:42.463
A soulless manipulation.

21:43.286 --> 21:45.104
And speaking of manipulation...

21:46.088 --> 21:48.107
It's like going to the movies,

21:48.504 --> 21:51.275
and we see the lovers' on-screen kiss,

21:51.388 --> 21:54.063
and the music swells and we buy it,
right?

21:54.994 --> 21:57.632
So when my date takes me home
and kisses me good night,

21:57.716 --> 22:00.153
if I don't hear the philharmonic
in my head, I dump him.

22:03.186 --> 22:06.338
Now, the question is, why do we buy it?

22:07.375 --> 22:10.499
We buy it, because whether
it's a myth or manipulation,

22:10.745 --> 22:13.587
let's face it.
We all want to fall in love. Right?

22:14.158 --> 22:18.844
Why? Because that experience
makes us feel completely alive.

22:18.978 --> 22:21.710
Where every sense is heightened,
every emotion is magnified,

22:21.857 --> 22:24.125
our everyday reality is shattered,

22:24.209 --> 22:26.397
and we are flung into the heavens.

22:26.817 --> 22:29.672
It may only last a moment,
an hour, an afternoon,

22:29.756 --> 22:31.719
but that doesn't diminish its value.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.024
Because we're left with memories

22:34.107 --> 22:36.207
that we treasure for
the rest of our lives.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.504
I read an article a while ago

22:39.191 --> 22:43.403
that said, 'When we fall in love,
we hear Puccini in our heads.'

22:43.856 --> 22:44.635
I love that.

22:45.458 --> 22:48.097
I think it's because
his music expresses

22:48.181 --> 22:52.659
our longing for passion in our lives,
and romantic love.

22:52.876 --> 22:55.140
And while we're listening to La Boheme

22:55.224 --> 22:57.826
or Turandot,
or reading Wuthering Heights,

22:57.910 --> 22:59.752
or watching Casablanca,

23:00.060 --> 23:02.460
a little bit of that love lives in us,
too.

23:03.547 --> 23:09.157
So the final question is,
why do people want to fall in love

23:09.270 --> 23:11.196
when it can have such a short shelf
life

23:11.394 --> 23:12.747
and be devastatingly painful?

23:12.830 --> 23:14.204
What do you think? Stacy?

23:14.288 --> 23:17.410
-It leads to propagation of the species?
-Mmm-hmm. Randy?

23:17.554 --> 23:19.872
Psychologically,
we need to connect with somebody.

23:19.956 --> 23:20.864
Could be. Jill.

23:20.985 --> 23:22.497
Because we're culturally
preconditioned?

23:23.088 --> 23:25.891
Good answers,
but much too intellectual for me.

23:26.872 --> 23:31.329
I think it's because,
as some of you already may know,

23:31.850 --> 23:36.539
while it does last,
it feels fucking great. That's why.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.274
Thank you. Thank you.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.230
I'm halfway through my meal,

24:00.313 --> 24:01.815
and you haven't even started yet.

24:03.054 --> 24:05.270
The perfect bite.

24:08.193 --> 24:09.339
Mmm.

24:12.976 --> 24:14.182
You need a therapist.

24:19.262 --> 24:21.150
Rose,
do we have to have the television on?

24:21.304 --> 24:23.244
Can't we have a civilized conversation?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.984
I know I'm not as
intellectually stimulating

24:26.074 --> 24:27.571
as some of you university people...

24:27.655 --> 24:31.733
Alright. Okay, I'm sorry.
How was your day, Mother?

24:31.931 --> 24:33.165
Who gives a shit?

24:33.465 --> 24:36.645
Come on.
I said I was sorry. Let's talk.

24:38.216 --> 24:39.458
I've lived too long.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.541
I should be dead,
not having conversations.

24:41.625 --> 24:45.190
You stop it, please.
Give me that! Talk to me already!

24:47.583 --> 24:48.383
All right.

24:49.676 --> 24:52.127
You haven't even noticed
I had my hair done differently.

24:54.897 --> 24:57.358
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I thought you looked different.

24:58.975 --> 24:59.782
It looks great.

25:01.096 --> 25:02.300
What's different about it?

25:05.855 --> 25:06.822
The... um...

25:08.797 --> 25:10.172
There's nothing different about it.

25:10.919 --> 25:13.509
You're just like your father.
So easy to trip up.

25:19.131 --> 25:22.114
So, how was... how was work?

25:23.654 --> 25:24.741
Same as always.

25:25.068 --> 25:27.800
Although I had one customer
come in looking for a makeover.

25:28.040 --> 25:28.857
She needed one.

25:29.858 --> 25:31.975
Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow,

25:32.426 --> 25:34.718
-ash brown foundation. Hideous.
-Hideous.

25:34.834 --> 25:35.367
Hideous.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.544
Anyway, she was shocked when
she found out how old I was.

25:38.975 --> 25:41.000
Oh. How old were you?

25:45.586 --> 25:46.275
Sorry.

25:48.663 --> 25:50.466
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.716
-Oh, yeah?
-He cornered me in the elevator.

25:53.208 --> 25:56.194
He wants to take me to some
Alzheimer's benefit. I said forget it.

25:58.529 --> 26:01.126
I can't believe he still asks
you after all these years.

26:01.804 --> 26:03.169
Why don't you go with him sometime?

26:03.253 --> 26:05.727
Oh, please. Those days are over.

26:06.161 --> 26:09.007
I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband. That's my life.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.336
I have no interest in
starting another one.

26:12.156 --> 26:14.063
Besides, he knows my situation with you.

26:17.818 --> 26:19.353
You're not seeing him because of me?

26:20.923 --> 26:21.540
How would it look?

26:21.989 --> 26:24.470
The mother's dating,
and the daughter stays home alone.

26:25.493 --> 26:28.716
Mom, who's looking?

26:29.970 --> 26:32.791
Hello. Hi.

26:35.387 --> 26:38.357
Hello, this is...

26:39.704 --> 26:43.310
Hello, I'm Gregory Larkin.

26:44.221 --> 26:45.975
Professor Gregory Larkin.

26:54.330 --> 26:56.997
Answer the phone. I'm sleeping.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.069
-Hello.
-Hello?

26:59.429 --> 27:01.673
-Yes, is Professor Larkin there?
-Who?

27:01.864 --> 27:03.895
I mean, is Professor Morgan there?

27:04.309 --> 27:09.279
-Barely. Who's this?
-This is Gregory Larkin.

27:10.130 --> 27:15.457
I'm a professor in the math
department at Columbia.

27:15.828 --> 27:18.750
I was just calling to see

27:19.095 --> 27:19.668
What?

27:20.482 --> 27:22.035
how you are tonight.

27:23.888 --> 27:25.507
I'm fine. How you are?

27:29.191 --> 27:29.858
Fine.

27:38.504 --> 27:41.289
I...
I hope it wasn't presumptuous of me,

27:41.373 --> 27:43.440
but I sat down in one of your classes.

27:44.102 --> 27:46.565
And I... I was very impressed.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.930
I was hoping we could
have dinner Saturday.

27:49.014 --> 27:49.845
Hold on.

27:52.143 --> 27:55.711
-Wait. Could you talk louder please?
-I sat in on your class.

27:56.632 --> 28:00.858
-Hold on. Don't go away.
-I was impressed with your teaching.

28:00.942 --> 28:03.903
I was hoping we could
have dinner Saturday.

28:07.341 --> 28:08.587
I can do this!

28:10.180 --> 28:11.805
-Hello, can you hear me?
-All right.

28:13.248 --> 28:14.029
Hello?

28:14.324 --> 28:15.872
Okay. Let's start again.

28:17.359 --> 28:19.334
You're a math teacher and
you want to eat dinner.

28:19.708 --> 28:21.761
I sat in on one of your classes.

28:21.845 --> 28:23.894
-Rose, who's on the phone?
-Be quiet!

28:24.106 --> 28:25.824
-I'm sorry.
-No, not you. Not you.

28:25.928 --> 28:27.881
-Who's calling?
-I don't know.

28:28.094 --> 28:31.668
Gregory Larkin.
Math department. Columbia.

28:47.954 --> 28:53.072
The theory of implicit differentiation

28:53.155 --> 28:55.533
is often thought of as complex.

28:55.813 --> 28:58.936
Uh, but in reality it is quite simple.

28:59.586 --> 29:02.250
It's simply a matter of pretending

29:02.334 --> 29:05.279
that Y is a function of X.

29:05.725 --> 29:07.169
And so, um...

29:09.560 --> 29:10.264
Mmm.

29:11.287 --> 29:11.940
Hi.

29:12.788 --> 29:13.878
Oh, hi.

29:14.732 --> 29:18.730
-I saw you pass by.
-Yeah. I was just passing by...

29:20.472 --> 29:23.715
I'm sorry about calling
the other night...

29:23.825 --> 29:25.214
I was so confused.

29:27.453 --> 29:30.091
So...
uh... Are we on for Saturday night?

29:31.323 --> 29:31.995
Sure.

29:32.210 --> 29:33.795
Good. I'm looking forward to it.

29:33.879 --> 29:35.688
Hmm. Moi aussi.

29:37.314 --> 29:38.209
Hmm.

29:44.152 --> 29:45.880
So. This one must be very good-looking

29:45.964 --> 29:47.426
for you to go to all this trouble.

29:48.552 --> 29:49.875
I hate lipstick. I can't stand it.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.109
That's not a good colour for you.

29:51.192 --> 29:52.844
Did you try the samples I brought home?

29:52.927 --> 29:54.445
It doesn't matter. I'm not going.

29:54.858 --> 29:56.626
Oh! What do you want to do for dinner?

29:56.710 --> 29:58.021
I don't care about dinner.

29:58.105 --> 30:00.187
I'm upset.
Can't you see that I'm upset?

30:00.271 --> 30:01.076
How should I know?

30:01.159 --> 30:02.922
You're always so relieved
when you cancel your dates.

30:03.006 --> 30:05.654
This is not a date. We're just
agreeing to eat at the same table.

30:05.996 --> 30:07.437
Then why does it matter how you look,

30:07.521 --> 30:09.569
unless you think something
might happen with this one?

30:09.653 --> 30:11.058
Mother,
would you stop calling him 'this one.'

30:11.141 --> 30:13.026
It sounds like you're
picking out a lobster.

30:13.337 --> 30:15.850
And nothing's going to happen.
He just likes the way I teach.

30:15.934 --> 30:17.663
-You need more colour.
-More colour than this?

30:17.746 --> 30:20.109
Yes. Look.
Would you sit down and let me do it?

30:20.193 --> 30:21.539
-All right.
-This is what I do a lot.

30:21.623 --> 30:23.570
-Don't make me look like a clown.
-No. You won't look like a clown.

30:23.654 --> 30:24.783
Here, you have to blend.

30:25.026 --> 30:26.444
-Where's the hairpiece?
-Here.

30:26.935 --> 30:29.138
Do you want me to make you
something before I leave?

30:29.264 --> 30:31.002
It's not such a bad thing
to keep a man waiting.

30:31.086 --> 30:32.245
You don't want him to think he's

30:32.329 --> 30:33.322
the only date you've had in years.

30:33.406 --> 30:35.467
-It's not a date!
-Give me the bow. Where's the bow?

30:35.551 --> 30:36.232
Here.

30:36.474 --> 30:37.434
Hi. Eddy.

30:37.556 --> 30:39.595
Hey, your mother did you up again.

30:39.678 --> 30:40.392
Looks terrific, Miss Morgan.

30:40.476 --> 30:41.979
-Thank you.
-Want me to get you a cab?

30:42.063 --> 30:43.410
-No, I'm fine.
-All right.

30:43.618 --> 30:46.963
Ooh, good. Sir!

30:55.842 --> 30:57.039
Sorry.

31:01.027 --> 31:01.939
Hello!

31:04.791 --> 31:06.550
Are you sure about this?
-Just, why don't you get in.

31:06.633 --> 31:07.501
You're going to take me?

31:07.584 --> 31:09.117
-Get in, lady.
-Thanks.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.643
Here's where I'm going,

31:11.934 --> 31:14.407
but don't go until I
put up the window here.

31:14.635 --> 31:16.036
Oh, no. No! No!

31:16.132 --> 31:17.258
-They're broke, lady.
-My hair!

31:17.348 --> 31:18.931
They're broke lady.
Don't complain to me.

31:19.015 --> 31:21.808
Don't complain to me.
Complain to the cab company.

31:32.080 --> 31:32.897
Oh!

31:33.307 --> 31:35.960
-Hi.
-Hi! Hi.

31:36.276 --> 31:38.991
I'm sorry. I apologise.

31:39.171 --> 31:41.550
I'm sorry. Apologise for what?
You're exactly on time.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.523
Oh! No! I mean, my hair.

31:44.030 --> 31:46.015
I must look like
I was attacked by wolves.

31:46.099 --> 31:50.145
Oh. I apologize, I didn't even notice.

31:50.475 --> 31:51.840
Mmm, uh...

31:54.828 --> 31:56.836
Could you excuse me while
I go to the ladies' room

31:56.927 --> 31:57.481
-for a minute?
-Sure, sure.

31:57.768 --> 31:58.879
I'll be right back.

32:05.147 --> 32:06.723
Do you enjoy dancing?

32:07.046 --> 32:10.385
Um.. yeah.
I used to love to dance with my father.

32:11.216 --> 32:12.083
You?

32:12.439 --> 32:15.421
-Oh. I find it embarrassing.
-Really.

32:15.511 --> 32:16.605
I enjoy watching it.

32:16.798 --> 32:18.935
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, thank you very much.

32:21.195 --> 32:23.129
-Watching?
-Pairs...

32:24.647 --> 32:26.235
It's interesting how coupling

32:26.319 --> 32:28.776
appears all through
nature and in mathematics.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.568
Oh, yes. You were telling
me something about pairs...

32:31.902 --> 32:33.542
The twin-prime conjecture.

32:33.955 --> 32:37.124
Yes, well...
it explores pairs of prime numbers,

32:37.348 --> 32:40.614
numbers that are only
divisible by themselves.

32:40.828 --> 32:45.896
Three-five.
Five-seven. Not seven-nine, because...

32:45.980 --> 32:49.952
-Nine can be divided by three.
-That's right.

32:51.074 --> 32:52.047
That's right.

32:52.146 --> 32:55.658
Then you have 11-13,
and 17-19 and so on.

32:55.742 --> 32:58.418
Well, what was discovered
was that what often occurred

32:58.501 --> 33:02.239
were pairs separated by...

33:02.323 --> 33:03.290
One number in between.

33:04.738 --> 33:07.034
Exactly. Exactly.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.086
Did you read my book?

33:10.406 --> 33:12.005
No, I'm sorry.

33:12.089 --> 33:15.493
That's all right.
This is really marvellous.

33:15.684 --> 33:18.455
Yeah. First date where I feel
like I am on a game show.

33:19.308 --> 33:21.048
Oh.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lecture.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.755
Oh. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to call it a date.

33:23.860 --> 33:24.387
No.

33:24.932 --> 33:29.183
It's just rare that I meet a person
I can discuss these things with.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.096
-Some pepper?
-Oh, no, not for me.

33:35.046 --> 33:35.552
Thank you.

33:35.705 --> 33:37.051
When you get the chance,
can you bring me

33:37.134 --> 33:39.846
a little side dish of
extra dressing please?

33:41.842 --> 33:45.016
I don't particularly like salad,
I just like the dressing.

33:45.548 --> 33:46.119
Ah.

33:47.508 --> 33:49.949
This twin-prime conjecture,
it's interesting.

33:50.478 --> 33:53.506
What would happen if you
counted past a million?

33:53.590 --> 33:54.987
Would there be pairs like that?

33:56.591 --> 33:58.585
I can't believe you thought of that.

33:59.149 --> 34:02.926
This is exactly what is yet to be
proven in the twin prime conjecture.

34:04.491 --> 34:09.386
You know, I have these tickets
for a concert next Saturday.

34:09.476 --> 34:11.156
I was wondering if
we can do this again.

34:13.492 --> 34:17.253
-Sure.
-Great. Terrific.

34:19.059 --> 34:23.007
What was it you wanted to
discuss about my teaching?

34:23.194 --> 34:24.101
Oh. Um....

34:25.495 --> 34:26.172
Well...

34:26.804 --> 34:30.284
I have a confession to make.
That was just an excuse to meet you.

34:31.594 --> 34:32.629
I hope you don't mind.

34:33.967 --> 34:34.690
Mind?

34:35.389 --> 34:37.563
That I didn't find
your class fascinating.

34:37.647 --> 34:41.524
In fact, I have many
questions, the first of which is,

34:42.803 --> 34:44.531
how do you get them to stay?

34:53.773 --> 34:54.545
Well?

34:56.315 --> 34:59.737
-Nothing.
-What happened to your hair?

35:02.060 --> 35:02.907
Don't ask.

35:05.148 --> 35:06.905
You don't think you'll see him again?

35:07.897 --> 35:09.401
No. We're going out next week.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.910
So, he must like you.

35:16.265 --> 35:17.256
Did he kiss you?

35:20.201 --> 35:20.747
No.

35:21.884 --> 35:22.458
Oh.

35:23.698 --> 35:25.217
That's kind of sweet, actually.

35:43.434 --> 35:45.909
-Hey!
-Hi. This is Cindy.

35:45.993 --> 35:46.819
Hello.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.174
This is a spectrum analyser.

35:57.699 --> 36:01.604
It makes graphic representations
of the music. Watch.

36:01.717 --> 36:02.310
It's fun.

36:03.130 --> 36:03.657
Yes.

36:06.047 --> 36:09.937
-Who's the girl?
-Rose Morgan.

36:11.245 --> 36:15.333
Henry Fine is a professor
in anthropology.

36:18.789 --> 36:20.280
Beautiful music, isn't it?

36:20.534 --> 36:22.616
-Beautiful.
-Beautiful atmosphere.

36:41.968 --> 36:44.147
Oh, god! I enjoyed that.

36:44.231 --> 36:45.285
Wasn't that terrific.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.809
Yeah.
Thank you so much for inviting me.

36:46.893 --> 36:48.662
Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure.

36:49.082 --> 36:52.033
Why don't you uh...
Why don't you come up to my apartment?

36:52.248 --> 36:53.422
I live just across the street.

36:53.513 --> 36:54.804
I want to give you a copy of my book.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.112
-Oh, I'd love that.
-Great.

36:58.241 --> 37:00.041
A copy of your book, I mean.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.580
I didn't mean to imply I want to
come up to your apartment, really.

37:02.664 --> 37:04.872
But, Rose, I'm inviting you up.

37:05.468 --> 37:06.588
Oh, yeah.

37:06.907 --> 37:10.623
If you like this kind of music,
I have some wonderful CDs,

37:10.707 --> 37:14.571
but they're...
well, they're also in my apartment.

37:16.170 --> 37:18.527
Greg, look.
I have to be honest with you.

37:18.617 --> 37:22.284
I, uh...
I'm a bit out of practice with this.

37:22.371 --> 37:24.623
Rose, I want you to feel comfortable.

37:24.707 --> 37:25.786
That's very important to me.

37:25.870 --> 37:26.413
It is?

37:26.519 --> 37:28.854
Yes,. So, I want to tell you up front.

37:29.952 --> 37:32.208
I'm not interested in sex.

37:33.325 --> 37:36.469
-You're not?
-No, and it has nothing to do with you.

37:36.553 --> 37:37.105
It doesn't?

37:37.189 --> 37:40.018
No.
It actually has to do with what you were

37:40.102 --> 37:41.578
talking about in your
class the other day.

37:41.931 --> 37:42.571
It does?

37:42.694 --> 37:45.738
Yes. I, too, believe that it's illusions

37:45.822 --> 37:48.767
about love and the emphasis on sex

37:48.973 --> 37:50.725
that keeps people today
separate in the world.

37:50.809 --> 37:55.656
As you said, yourself,
romance is a myth, a manipulation.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.339
Oh, no. Wait.
I was referring to academic opinions

37:58.430 --> 37:59.407
that are purely subjective.

37:59.491 --> 38:01.511
No. No. You were right!

38:01.638 --> 38:05.479
Relationships that are based
on romantic love are worthless.

38:05.563 --> 38:07.867
There's no point to them,
they have no value.

38:08.863 --> 38:10.287
Did you stay for my whole class?

38:10.431 --> 38:14.721
No. No. I left when you were
talking about the music

38:14.805 --> 38:16.574
that we hear when lovers
kiss in the movies.

38:16.657 --> 38:19.436
And I agree. It is so manipulative!

38:19.568 --> 38:23.168
Because, in real life,
we don't hear music when we kiss.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.321
And the person you're with isn't
a movie star.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.734
It's a malicious... a malicious...

38:27.818 --> 38:30.840
-Fantasy?
-Fantasy. Fantasy. Right.

38:30.924 --> 38:32.091
Is it all right
if I sit down for a minute?

38:32.175 --> 38:33.308
Yes. Go ahead.

38:33.461 --> 38:40.306
The addiction to beauty and
perfection created by advertising

38:40.390 --> 38:42.968
just feeds on people's
pathetic desires.

38:44.082 --> 38:46.138
People... they don't have their
own opinions any more.

38:46.244 --> 38:47.953
-Do you agree?
-Well, I know it's...

38:48.037 --> 38:50.374
The media tells us what's
beautiful and what's not.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.714
TV shows tell us what a relationship

38:52.798 --> 38:55.088
is supposed to look like and feel like.
And sex!

38:55.172 --> 38:55.704
Yeah?

38:55.824 --> 38:58.556
No. No. I don't even want to tell
you how that's ruined my life...

38:58.640 --> 38:59.640
Oh, no. Go ahead. Tell me.

38:59.724 --> 39:03.994
-Well, I go crazy.
-Really? Yeah?

39:04.078 --> 39:06.220
When I want someone sexually,
I go out of my mind.

39:06.304 --> 39:07.264
You're kidding.

39:07.348 --> 39:08.231
Oh. Oh...

39:08.757 --> 39:12.885
Do you remember that movie
where the woman kills the bunny?

39:13.550 --> 39:16.487
-Fatal Attraction?
-Right. Right. Granted, it was a film.

39:16.571 --> 39:17.116
Yeah.

39:17.912 --> 39:19.847
I can understand what the
woman was going through.

39:19.931 --> 39:20.587
Are you kidding?

39:20.671 --> 39:22.862
Not that I would ever kill an animal.

39:22.946 --> 39:23.559
Oh. That's great.

39:23.738 --> 39:26.337
I'm not too familiar with
that feeling that you get

39:26.421 --> 39:27.893
when you want someone so much,

39:27.977 --> 39:29.174
it physically hurts not to have them?

39:29.264 --> 39:30.082
Yeah. I know what you mean.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.661
This fiction, known as falling in love,

39:31.758 --> 39:34.321
it drives people crazy,
as you said in your class.

39:34.411 --> 39:35.287
I said that? When did I say that?

39:35.371 --> 39:37.785
And then, at the end of it,
you're either mad, alone or...

39:37.869 --> 39:39.581
-I said dead. Dead.
-Dead!

39:39.665 --> 39:41.007
But that was fiction.

39:41.091 --> 39:43.868
Right! Right! We're dead! Dead!

39:44.002 --> 39:47.476
Now,
now, I do believe that two people...

39:47.816 --> 39:50.328
well.
they can come together, even marry,

39:50.412 --> 39:55.346
for reasons that are more meaningful,
more concrete than sex.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.085
A love that grows in
time out of respect,

39:59.234 --> 40:02.210
love, trust, common interest.

40:02.294 --> 40:05.084
Have you noticed that friendships
last longer than marriages?

40:05.185 --> 40:07.504
-Well, that's sure, but...
-I can even say...

40:07.588 --> 40:09.874
But I think the 12th
century was on to something.

40:09.958 --> 40:10.789
Oh, yeah?

40:11.248 --> 40:13.483
Would you like some coffee? Tea?

40:15.615 --> 40:16.861
Got any scotch?

40:19.461 --> 40:20.290
Yeah.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.822
So. Are you busy this week?

40:22.999 --> 40:24.279
Um... no. I...

40:24.472 --> 40:26.236
I was hoping
you could help me with my teaching.

40:26.611 --> 40:29.494
I'm sure you're much better than
you give yourself credit for.

40:29.578 --> 40:32.130
Hey! Maybe you could sit in on one of
my classes,

40:32.213 --> 40:33.138
tell me what you think.

40:33.613 --> 40:37.901
If X squared plus Y squared equals 16,

40:38.187 --> 40:42.062
how do we find DY,
DX as an implicit function of X and Y?

40:42.215 --> 40:46.485
Well, Y is a function of X,
so we differentiate both sides...

40:46.748 --> 40:48.311
The right hand side is....

40:49.185 --> 40:50.972
What is the left hand side?

40:51.905 --> 40:53.225
The left hand side is...

40:53.791 --> 40:55.448
And you're like walking
across the room like this,

40:55.532 --> 40:58.113
and you're into your own thing.

40:58.197 --> 40:59.048
It's like uh...

40:59.132 --> 41:03.214
the body language is very detached,
very alienating.

41:03.298 --> 41:05.860
I mean... you see what I'm saying? I...

41:06.776 --> 41:10.887
I just think you have to relate
more to the kids, engage them.

41:11.301 --> 41:13.751
You're up there with your back to
the room,

41:13.834 --> 41:16.123
having a great time solving your own
problems.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.857
So,
it's like you're having a math party,

41:17.941 --> 41:19.207
and you only invited yourself.

41:19.974 --> 41:21.802
-No math party.
-No math party.

41:22.189 --> 41:25.453
So, relax.
Loosen up. Have some fun with them.

41:25.879 --> 41:28.758
Relax. Have fun...
What was the other thing you said?

41:29.492 --> 41:32.324
Loosen up, Greg. Put the pen down.

41:32.408 --> 41:33.973
I'm not going to test
you on this stuff.

41:34.199 --> 41:36.429
Come on. Teach me something. Anything.

41:36.768 --> 41:37.808
-Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

41:39.808 --> 41:42.922
If a...
If a ball is thrown up into the air,

41:43.005 --> 41:46.821
and its height, H, equals 100 T...

41:46.905 --> 41:48.279
Gregory, think. What are you doing?

41:48.362 --> 41:51.320
No.
Turn around. Turn around. Talk to me.

41:52.508 --> 41:53.908
Okay. Uh...

41:54.220 --> 41:56.186
T is time in seconds,

41:56.269 --> 41:58.700
at what limit is the speed approaching,
when T approaches...

41:58.790 --> 42:00.289
You lost me. I'm...

42:00.373 --> 42:03.248
What does all that mean?
You have to put it in some context.

42:03.332 --> 42:06.280
Make up a story. Jazz it up a little.
Find some humour in it.

42:06.765 --> 42:08.258
Humour in calculus?

42:09.768 --> 42:12.331
-Well, try telling a story.
-A story?

42:15.467 --> 42:16.387
Oh. Okay.

42:18.313 --> 42:19.822
Once upon a time,

42:21.838 --> 42:24.401
there was a ball.

42:26.029 --> 42:26.889
And...

42:28.178 --> 42:29.934
it was thrown into the air.

42:33.756 --> 42:35.433
And its height...

42:37.211 --> 42:38.887
Maybe I should just write books.

42:38.971 --> 42:41.873
Why> No one understands those, either.
Just kidding.

42:43.971 --> 42:46.920
Don't give up. Don't give up.
Do it again. Try it again.

42:47.338 --> 42:48.952
-Tell you another story?
-Right. Another story.

42:50.386 --> 42:52.525
Hi, Professor Larkin. Oh. I'm sorry.

42:52.609 --> 42:54.471
No, no, no. No, no, no.

42:55.502 --> 42:56.598
That's all right.

42:58.472 --> 42:59.612
Do we have an appointment?

42:59.872 --> 43:02.176
No. Actually, I wanted to make one.

43:02.574 --> 43:03.753
It's about next semester.

43:04.401 --> 43:07.989
Uh... oh... uh... uh...

43:08.073 --> 43:11.603
Tomorrow. Could you come back tomorrow?
After class?

43:17.992 --> 43:20.011
My head is swimming. It's hot.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.484
Why don't you put your
head between your legs.

43:23.278 --> 43:24.392
That's a good idea.

43:27.768 --> 43:30.852
Pretty girl. Very pretty.

43:31.096 --> 43:32.717
How could you tell
under all that make-up?

43:33.157 --> 43:34.616
You don't use make-up, do you?

43:35.407 --> 43:37.626
What's the point?
I'd still look like me, only in colour.

43:38.303 --> 43:40.686
No. You're just too smart for that.

43:40.826 --> 43:41.805
You know who you are.

43:41.888 --> 43:44.688
You're a confident,
no-nonsense, no frills kind of woman.

43:44.772 --> 43:45.929
I sound like an airline.

43:47.014 --> 43:49.063
I'm sorry, I'm probably saying it wrong.

43:49.299 --> 43:52.048
It's just that you don't
need any of that, Rose.

43:55.385 --> 43:59.009
Thanks. How's your head?

44:01.335 --> 44:02.206
-I think I'm...
-Yeah?

44:02.290 --> 44:04.092
I think, you know, food will help you.

44:04.512 --> 44:07.054
-Pizza, maybe?
-Yeah. That would be great.

44:07.774 --> 44:08.981
Thought you were helping here.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.852
Where can we go? Some place interesting.

44:12.090 --> 44:14.176
Dancing? Why did I say that?

44:14.260 --> 44:16.037
Oh! We could just go to
that great dessert place.

44:16.128 --> 44:16.658
Sure.

44:16.742 --> 44:18.811
Why is everything that's
delicious things fattening.

44:18.901 --> 44:20.333
Oh, my mother would kill me. I'd love...

44:20.416 --> 44:22.830
What is that, a Danish?
I mean, cinnamon...

44:24.503 --> 44:26.182
This is the one. Right here.

44:26.266 --> 44:27.404
Uh... ma'am...

44:27.761 --> 44:29.897
Trees are so fascinating.

44:30.224 --> 44:31.942
They don't have to touch to propagate.

44:32.508 --> 44:35.311
Oh! Correct.
You would find that fascinating.

44:36.134 --> 44:37.023
How many do I need?

44:37.139 --> 44:39.799
You need a two... one,
two, three, four, five, six...

44:39.886 --> 44:41.913
Yes/ Oh, you're right.
Why didn't I see that?

44:42.510 --> 44:44.491
One, two, three, four, five.

44:44.575 --> 44:46.212
Thank you very much. I owe you one.

44:46.295 --> 44:49.477
Sometimes you don't see what's
right in front of your face.

44:54.602 --> 44:58.298
Six and a five. I got you. Got you.

44:59.098 --> 45:02.553
Oh, the pretzel! You can have mine.

45:02.637 --> 45:05.295
You sounded excited on the phone.
What was it?

45:05.379 --> 45:07.118
I'm not ready to write,
but let me run this by you...

45:07.202 --> 45:07.560
Mmm-hmm..

45:07.644 --> 45:09.546
I'm Donna pitch my idea
of my falling in love

45:09.629 --> 45:11.956
is a defiabale man-made cultural
creation,

45:12.039 --> 45:15.137
and expand that to include
the biological participation

45:15.220 --> 45:16.753
and its effect on the individual.

45:16.844 --> 45:17.740
-Greg.
-You see...

45:17.824 --> 45:18.790
You need a hobby.

45:24.261 --> 45:25.490
Oh! Oh!

45:25.574 --> 45:27.606
God! I can't believe we've
been dating for three months,

45:27.690 --> 45:28.997
and we haven't even kissed!

45:29.203 --> 45:30.717
I can't figure out the list.
Just stick to that.

45:30.865 --> 45:35.061
-How do you say hello?
-Well, we nod. It works.

45:35.786 --> 45:38.392
Are you telling me you mean
you haven't even touched?

45:38.576 --> 45:41.182
Well, I fell down once,
and he picked me up. Does that count?

45:41.796 --> 45:44.663
-We talk a lot. That's what we do.
-About what?

45:44.747 --> 45:46.429
About everything. It's great.

45:46.512 --> 45:49.919
'Cause I don't worry about what I say,
what I wear, what I eat...

45:50.003 --> 45:51.855
It's such a relief
eating in front of a man

45:51.939 --> 45:54.223
and not worrying whether he's
going to get frightened or not.

45:54.307 --> 45:55.288
I like that.

45:55.634 --> 45:57.475
-He's really fun to be with too.
-Yeah?

45:57.701 --> 45:59.730
Well, maybe
'fun' is too cheerful a word.

45:59.813 --> 46:01.204
-He's interesting. That's what he is.
-Interesting.

46:01.288 --> 46:03.816
-How many men can you say that about?
-Not many.

46:03.923 --> 46:06.629
Do you think a tie is too
personal a birthday gift?

46:06.713 --> 46:08.028
Not unless you're planning to use it

46:08.111 --> 46:09.509
on something else other than his neck?

46:09.593 --> 46:10.444
Oh...

46:10.919 --> 46:13.712
-Does he look good in vests?
-He'd look good in a garbage bag.

46:13.795 --> 46:15.429
Why do you want him to meet your mother?

46:15.513 --> 46:16.948
I don't. It was my big mouth.

46:17.450 --> 46:19.528
I kept telling him what
a great cook I was.

46:19.611 --> 46:21.805
The next thing I know,
I'm offering birthday dinner...

46:21.889 --> 46:23.719
and I've got to find him something nice.

46:23.802 --> 46:26.133
Maybe after he meets her,
I'll probably never see him again.

46:26.216 --> 46:28.828
-Hi, girls. Rose!
-Hi!

46:28.911 --> 46:29.874
Hi, Claire.

46:30.351 --> 46:32.970
I'm starving. Can we eat?
-Hi. Yeah. Sounds good.

46:33.054 --> 46:34.401
Oh, honey. I hate to turn down a meal,

46:34.484 --> 46:36.208
but I got a date with a post-grad.

46:36.425 --> 46:39.178
Claire, help her find a gift
for Dr. Strangelove.

46:39.261 --> 46:40.912
-Who?
-Nothing.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.848
You know, we should get you some blush.

46:43.110 --> 46:45.085
-No!
-I'm hungry, Claire.

46:45.169 --> 46:46.418
-Fruit.
-Fruit?

46:46.598 --> 46:47.418
Yes. Fruit.

46:47.515 --> 46:49.921
Why are you so grumpy today?
How's everything going?

46:50.005 --> 46:50.681
Oh, please!

46:51.167 --> 46:53.404
If he wasn't gorgeous, rich and
straight,

46:53.487 --> 46:54.809
I wouldn't be even bothered.

46:54.893 --> 46:56.118
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

46:56.364 --> 46:58.292
I'm just sick to death
of the sight of the man

46:58.375 --> 47:00.275
I'm bound to for eternity, that's all.

47:00.359 --> 47:01.301
Why are you saying that?

47:01.420 --> 47:03.313
Why am I saying that? Two seats please.

47:03.411 --> 47:03.843
Yes, ma'am.

47:03.927 --> 47:05.632
Because, no matter where I go,

47:05.716 --> 47:07.725
no matter what I do, there he is.

47:07.868 --> 47:10.779
In the kitchen, in the bathroom,
on the phone, on my finger.

47:10.925 --> 47:12.579
-I was asleep the other night.
-Mmm-hmm...

47:12.663 --> 47:14.618
When I wake up, he's staring at me.

47:14.702 --> 47:16.031
-Staring at you?
-Yeah.

47:16.115 --> 47:19.221
-I think that's sweet.
-I think it's kind of strange.

47:19.369 --> 47:21.020
Uh. Hey. Wait on! Let's go.

47:21.324 --> 47:24.497
Do you know any idea how
weird that makes me feel?

47:24.697 --> 47:27.342
I'm in the middle of one
of my lesbian orgy dreams,

47:27.425 --> 47:29.894
and he's staring at me like
I'm supposed to include him.

47:29.978 --> 47:31.930
I can't even fantasize in private.

47:38.789 --> 47:39.516
So...

47:40.242 --> 47:42.360
Mom said you've been seeing
someone pretty steady.

47:42.444 --> 47:44.235
-Good.
-Is he cute?

47:45.587 --> 47:47.000
Oh, shit!

47:47.484 --> 47:48.639
-What?
-Hi, girls.

47:49.483 --> 47:50.925
-Hi, Alex.
-Rose.

47:51.009 --> 47:52.215
What are you doing here?

47:52.763 --> 47:55.782
Well, I...
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.

47:57.046 --> 47:58.466
Is that a terrible thing to do?

48:00.266 --> 48:04.893
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room. Alone.

48:10.037 --> 48:11.608
Can you believe this weather?

48:12.515 --> 48:14.652
It's almost April, and it's still cold.

48:17.262 --> 48:18.957
I'm glad I have you alone actually.

48:19.195 --> 48:20.459
Can I ask you a question?

48:20.666 --> 48:22.986
-Mmm-hmm..
-It'll sound strange, but...

48:25.779 --> 48:26.894
Is Claire happy?

48:28.226 --> 48:29.942
I mean, do you think she's happy?

48:32.169 --> 48:36.793
Um... Yes, I think she is. Why?

48:37.647 --> 48:40.517
I'm being silly.
I'm a first-time husband, I guess.

48:41.850 --> 48:43.109
If she doesn't wake up every morning

48:43.192 --> 48:44.959
telling me how ecstatic she is, I...

48:45.876 --> 48:46.778
I worry.

48:50.357 --> 48:52.406
Did you ever think,
when you and I first met,

48:52.490 --> 48:53.834
I'd end up marrying your sister?

48:55.079 --> 48:56.800
And I have you to thank for that.

48:58.019 --> 48:59.431
You made this possible.

49:01.635 --> 49:04.390
Knowing you has changed my life, Rose.

49:05.454 --> 49:06.732
Don't... don't do that.

49:07.337 --> 49:10.371
What? What am I doing?

49:13.331 --> 49:14.743
You don't even know, do you?

49:19.605 --> 49:21.473
Oh, Rose.

49:21.727 --> 49:23.826
Just tell Claire that I had to run.
Okay?

49:24.217 --> 49:26.006
Rose, Rose, I'm sorry.

49:31.940 --> 49:34.519
Ah! I really thought I was over him.

49:34.943 --> 49:38.676
I hate this. It's so stupid. I... I...

49:38.763 --> 49:41.764
-I must sound so pathetic.
-No, no. Not at all.

49:41.848 --> 49:45.903
He asked if Claire was happy,
and I lied.

49:46.786 --> 49:49.692
-Isn't that awful?
-Nothing criminal.

49:52.529 --> 49:54.715
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

49:54.799 --> 49:56.542
You sounded so upset over the phone.

49:56.626 --> 49:58.273
-Are you feeling better now?
-Yeah.

49:58.657 --> 49:59.908
Yeah. A little.

50:00.304 --> 50:04.171
-You know, Rose, it takes time.
-Yeah, I know.

50:05.074 --> 50:08.019
Greg, I want you to know that I...

50:08.951 --> 50:13.002
I really value our friendship.
It means a lot to me.

50:13.870 --> 50:17.276
I feel the same way,
which is why tonight...

50:17.360 --> 50:20.992
Tonight? I better go home,
Because, I have to get dinner ready.

50:21.193 --> 50:22.321
I'll see you at 8:00, okay?

50:22.405 --> 50:25.861
Uh... uh... Shall I bring anything...
something for your mother?

50:26.421 --> 50:31.456
Uh... yeah,
a wooden stake and a crucifix. Bye.

50:34.738 --> 50:36.664
Rose loves to fold napkins.

50:37.469 --> 50:40.345
-It's one of her idiosyncrasies.
-Oh!

50:41.124 --> 50:44.036
You'll have to skip me.
I came home late from work

50:44.119 --> 50:47.228
and just threw this on.
God knows how I look.

50:53.953 --> 50:58.626
-I hope you like it.
-Oh, my God, Rose, it's art!

50:59.207 --> 51:00.509
No. No. It's not art.

51:00.593 --> 51:04.981
No. No. No. An artist isn't just
somebody who paints or sculpts.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.391
It's somebody who sets
the table a certain way,

51:07.474 --> 51:10.021
prepares a meal a certain way
or teaches in a certain way.

51:10.161 --> 51:13.132
-You're an artist, isn't she?
-Thank you.

51:13.893 --> 51:17.152
Why didn't you use the Limoges, dear?
We have company.

51:18.030 --> 51:20.370
-May I serve you?
-Oh. Pretty.

51:21.874 --> 51:23.638
-Rose!
-My hands are clean.

51:24.610 --> 51:28.609
We go to all this trouble,
and Rose and I don't eat very much.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.349
-Really?
-Mmm.

51:30.883 --> 51:32.082
Whenever I've been with Rose,

51:32.165 --> 51:34.042
I've noticed she's  had
a very healthy appetite.

51:34.632 --> 51:35.465
#

51:35.950 --> 51:38.506
I can't stand women who eat
two bites and say they're full.

51:38.600 --> 51:39.447
Thank, god.

51:42.966 --> 51:45.589
Rose,
do you really need extra salt dear?

51:46.196 --> 51:49.115
Do you know how much water a
woman retains with too much salt?

51:50.699 --> 51:52.801
-Can I have some?
-Here you go.

51:52.885 --> 51:54.086
And the potatoes too.

51:54.242 --> 51:55.647
Mmm-mmm. You don't need them.

51:57.326 --> 51:59.512
Have you ever sat in on one
of your daughter's classes?

51:59.629 --> 52:01.847
Oh!
My mother sitting in one of my classes?

52:01.989 --> 52:03.716
-Rose!
-What?

52:04.838 --> 52:07.002
Oh. That's... that's the best part.

52:13.859 --> 52:15.910
Rose tells me you've never been married.

52:16.139 --> 52:17.013
Mom.

52:17.776 --> 52:20.292
Yeah... that's all right, Rose. Um...

52:21.423 --> 52:25.070
That's correct, Mrs.
Morgan. I... I haven't.

52:25.256 --> 52:28.600
I guess that I haven't
found the right girl.

52:29.193 --> 52:31.980
I've had several relationships
that haven't worked out, but...

52:32.382 --> 52:33.986
that's all going to change.

52:34.350 --> 52:35.563
Really? Why?

52:36.871 --> 52:39.686
Well, as I... as I told Rose,

52:39.974 --> 52:44.957
I have a theory about love,
and sex.

52:45.106 --> 52:46.468
Does anybody want coffee?

52:46.949 --> 52:48.447
Oh, I want some.

52:48.531 --> 52:51.634
-What theory?
-Regular or decaf?

52:53.077 --> 52:57.029
-Regular.
-I can make cappuccinos.

52:58.261 --> 53:01.330
Cappuccinos. Would you like cappuccinos?
How about that? Huh?

53:01.414 --> 53:03.235
Greg, why don't you come
to the kitchen and help me?

53:03.319 --> 53:05.355
Rose, why won't you put the coffee on?

53:06.489 --> 53:08.903
Mother, I made dinner.
Why don't you put the coffee on.

53:09.214 --> 53:10.277
I've raised two daughters.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.462
I buried a husband, I've made my coffee.

53:21.931 --> 53:24.223
Well! Alone at last.

53:26.549 --> 53:28.201
I've heard a lot about you.

53:28.284 --> 53:30.947
-And I've heard a lot about you.
-Oh.

53:32.754 --> 53:35.273
You've been seeing a lot of my
daughter these last few months.

53:36.495 --> 53:38.110
I hope you don't mind my asking...

53:39.640 --> 53:41.912
I'd like to know what
your intentions are.

53:44.585 --> 53:45.945
My intentions?

53:48.371 --> 53:49.358
Well...

53:51.622 --> 53:54.863
What a lovely meal!
Oh... Gosh, you're a good cook.

53:54.967 --> 53:57.151
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. I didn't oversell myself?

53:57.235 --> 54:00.263
No. No. On the contrary,
when you go through all that trouble...

54:00.700 --> 54:02.611
Of course I had to go
through all that trouble.

54:02.695 --> 54:03.973
It was your birthday.

54:05.474 --> 54:06.882
You know, what are friends for,

54:06.965 --> 54:11.716
but to give each other
presents and stuff, and...

54:12.109 --> 54:13.269
Happy birthday.

54:14.788 --> 54:17.110
Rose... I forgot.

54:17.200 --> 54:19.438
-Open it up! Open it up! Open it up!
-You shouldn't have gone...

54:19.522 --> 54:22.041
I know. I know.
I know. I really hope you like it.

54:23.966 --> 54:26.752
-What are these? Dice?
-They once were dice.

54:26.835 --> 54:31.442
-Now, they're cuff links with...
-Prime numbers!

54:31.732 --> 54:33.310
Two, three, five, no nine.

54:33.394 --> 54:36.086
They're so beautiful! How'd you do that?

54:36.170 --> 54:38.468
I had them made. Specially for you.

54:39.352 --> 54:41.703
I hope they're okay.
They were done very fast.

54:41.787 --> 54:44.064
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

54:49.542 --> 54:50.483
Yeah. Well...

54:52.904 --> 54:54.178
Rose... uh...

54:55.201 --> 54:58.731
I've been meaning to ask you something,
and I can only say this once...

54:58.815 --> 54:59.405
What?

55:01.024 --> 55:02.125
Sit down.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.953
I think we have a lot in common.

55:06.036 --> 55:08.479
And, although I am aware
certain variables are

55:08.562 --> 55:10.645
and forever will be unknown, as is
the case

55:10.729 --> 55:13.241
with most complex equations,
where you have two completely diverse...

55:13.325 --> 55:15.452
Greg, talk to me.

55:17.463 --> 55:18.865
I'm not saying this right, am I?

55:18.982 --> 55:20.405
-Ummm...
-What?

55:23.145 --> 55:26.777
This... this feeling you have for Alex,

55:27.721 --> 55:29.698
it won't be the same with me.

55:29.782 --> 55:33.093
You won't have that constant
ache in the pit of your stomach,

55:33.177 --> 55:36.930
because we're not in love.

55:37.974 --> 55:41.924
I think we do share a genuine
affection for each other.

55:42.266 --> 55:44.451
We share a passion for knowledge

55:44.535 --> 55:45.953
rather than a physical passion.

55:46.293 --> 55:51.944
Although,
if sex is something that interests you,

55:53.153 --> 55:58.657
I'm sure I could provide that on
occasion, given enough warning.

55:59.676 --> 56:00.958
What... what are you saying?

56:01.124 --> 56:03.532
Well, were both in love and we
were both miserable.

56:03.636 --> 56:04.783
And we're both alone...

56:05.012 --> 56:07.861
which is a waste really,
because as people, we're quite valuable.

56:08.584 --> 56:09.324
Yeah...

56:09.852 --> 56:12.160
Rose, when I look at you,

56:13.580 --> 56:17.138
I... I see a woman
unlike any I've ever known before.

56:17.485 --> 56:20.850
Your mind,
your humour, your passion for ideas.

56:21.583 --> 56:23.429
I'm very fond of you.

56:24.456 --> 56:28.296
I feel in a strange way when I'm
with you, I feel as if I'm...

56:29.991 --> 56:31.959
as if I'm home.

56:34.851 --> 56:36.700
So I think we should get married.

56:37.635 --> 56:38.108
Huh!

56:38.408 --> 56:41.410
If people marry for
sexual passion which fades

56:41.493 --> 56:42.283
or for beauty which fades,

56:42.367 --> 56:44.350
why are my reasons
more insane than those?

56:47.188 --> 56:48.986
Are you in shock or just appalled?

56:50.900 --> 56:52.365
Blink if you can hear me.

56:56.785 --> 56:57.568
Why... why are you laughing?

56:57.652 --> 57:04.061
I just... I'm sorry. This sounds silly,
but I was just thinking...

57:06.159 --> 57:11.198
How could I... How could I marry
someone that I've never even...

57:14.706 --> 57:15.278
You know...

57:17.882 --> 57:18.497
Oh.

57:27.658 --> 57:28.358
kissed.

57:30.779 --> 57:32.557
You know, before you answer,

57:32.640 --> 57:34.599
there is one other thing
I have to tell you.

57:34.683 --> 57:36.288
I promised your sister I wouldn't,

57:36.372 --> 57:38.496
but I can't enter into
this without you knowing.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.646
You love Claire, too?

57:40.638 --> 57:43.047
-No. No. I... uh..
-You just slept with her?

57:43.131 --> 57:44.374
Oh, god. No!

57:44.471 --> 57:46.811
-You want to sleep with her?
-I don't even know your sister.

57:46.895 --> 57:48.092
-Ah!
-No! No!

57:48.176 --> 57:51.403
It's about how I found you, you see.
I wrote this ad...

57:51.810 --> 57:52.848
-Uh...
-An ad?

57:52.932 --> 57:54.881
-Yes.
-I think that's kind of great.

57:55.207 --> 57:56.694
-h, you do.
-Uh huh.

57:56.906 --> 57:59.679
Oh, what a relief.
I thought you were Donna be upset.

57:59.763 --> 58:00.894
Why? You picked me.

58:01.513 --> 58:04.307
Well,
actually, I found you through this...

58:04.391 --> 58:07.898
it was this
charming woman on TV...

58:08.423 --> 58:09.407
Felicia...

58:22.670 --> 58:23.720
Well, well, well...

58:25.806 --> 58:26.531
Ha...

58:29.208 --> 58:29.961
So?

58:32.944 --> 58:34.642
Gregory just proposed to me.

58:37.247 --> 58:38.288
Do you need a valium?

58:40.274 --> 58:42.865
I know you don't have
much respect my opinion,

58:42.948 --> 58:44.969
but I don't trust him.

58:45.254 --> 58:47.741
I mean, where's the attraction?

58:47.978 --> 58:50.325
You mean, why is he attracted to me?

58:50.774 --> 58:52.811
He's not, mother.
Does that make you feel better?

58:53.305 --> 58:55.859
He doesn't want sex.
He wants to be companions.

58:56.145 --> 58:57.332
Companion?

58:58.408 --> 59:00.638
What sane person would agree to that
kind of marriage?

59:01.135 --> 59:04.080
I never heard of anything so ridiculous.
It's not natural.

59:04.164 --> 59:06.140
What's natural? Claire and Alex?

59:06.227 --> 59:07.370
He wants me, Mother!

59:07.453 --> 59:09.345
Maybe not the same
way, you and Claire were wanted...

59:09.442 --> 59:13.045
I'm sure he wants you.
He wants you to cook and clean for him!

59:13.129 --> 59:14.946
Then it won't be much different from
living here.

59:15.049 --> 59:17.340
I happen to know that he
found you through an ad.

59:17.424 --> 59:18.729
Your sister told me.

59:19.220 --> 59:21.265
I already know, Mom. Sorry.

59:23.664 --> 59:29.453
Look... I know this isn't your
average proposal, but let's face it.

59:30.216 --> 59:32.328
You know,
they're not standing in line for me.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.951
And besides, we have a lot in common.
We really like each other!

59:36.035 --> 59:38.142
Well then say yes!
What do you want from me?

59:38.355 --> 59:40.089
I can live alone. I can manage.

59:40.369 --> 59:43.062
If you think getting married under these
conditions is normal,

59:43.146 --> 59:44.195
then go ahead.

59:47.505 --> 59:48.367
Why do you do that?

59:50.689 --> 59:53.756
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?

59:55.276 --> 59:58.580
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.

59:59.462 --> 01:00:02.429
Why don't you want me to have
just a little bit of that?

01:00:04.716 --> 01:00:08.577
I'm getting older, too, Mom.
Why can't you be happy for me?

01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:11.340
But you can't, can you?

01:00:14.142 --> 01:00:16.310
Because you're scared
to death of being alone.

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:19.372
-And you're jealous.
-Jealous?

01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:21.950
Jealous because a man wants me.

01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:26.098
A good-looking man wants me.
How ridiculous!

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:28.940
Well, you know something, Mom?

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:31.811
A man does.

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:54.226
Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan

01:00:54.466 --> 01:00:56.252
have placed rings on
each other's fingers

01:00:56.407 --> 01:00:57.793
and have agreed to share their lives

01:00:57.877 --> 01:00:59.790
and we hope, recognize
each other as equals.

01:01:00.313 --> 01:01:02.361
They shall seek through
kindness and understanding

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.515
to achieve a life together as they
have envisioned.

01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:07.143
We are gathered here to
participate and witness

01:01:07.227 --> 01:01:08.533
the special ceremony of marriage,

01:01:08.783 --> 01:01:11.357
which is a means of establishing
and continuing our home.

01:01:11.639 --> 01:01:14.056
And as much as you have consented
together to live in wedlock

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:15.867
and have  exchanged
vows before witnesses,

01:01:16.013 --> 01:01:17.192
by the authority vested in me,

01:01:17.276 --> 01:01:18.922
and according to the law of the State of
New York,

01:01:19.005 --> 01:01:20.485
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:01:20.704 --> 01:01:22.331
Here's your certificate and good luck.

01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:23.600
Thank you very much.

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.284
Congratulations! She's a great...

01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:31.151
Yes. I've heard so much about you.

01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:34.075
-Likewise about you. You're pretty...
-We all ought to...

01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:36.122
Absolutely.
That'll be wonderful. Excuse me.

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:38.344
Congratulations.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.036
Had I known you were this good-looking,

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.692
I'd have answered the ad for myself.

01:01:41.918 --> 01:01:44.644
Oh! Congratulations.
She's the best person I know.

01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:48.593
I mean if I were a man,
I'd be all over her.

01:01:49.866 --> 01:01:53.227
Good luck and congratulations.

01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:56.715
I'm sure you'll both be
very fascinating to watch.

01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:06.917
-Rose?
-Yeah?

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:10.298
Isn't it amazing how many
books you accumulate over the years?

01:02:10.678 --> 01:02:14.954
-I know what you mean.
-I can't believe it. And the dust!

01:02:15.974 --> 01:02:18.159
This place needs a good cleaning.

01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:19.765
We'll take care of that.

01:02:23.749 --> 01:02:25.670
I made some room on the
shelf for your books.

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:27.403
-Oh, good.
-Need any help?

01:02:27.518 --> 01:02:31.718
No. Every thing's pretty
much put in its place.

01:02:37.769 --> 01:02:39.252
What would you like to do?

01:02:41.072 --> 01:02:41.812
Go to bed.

01:02:43.563 --> 01:02:45.094
To sleep... I mean... to...

01:02:45.284 --> 01:02:48.885
In order to sleep,
you go to the bed for sleeping.

01:02:52.757 --> 01:02:54.497
-Unless you'd rather do something else.
-Sorry. What?

01:02:54.581 --> 01:02:56.626
-What?
-No, go. Please go ahead.

01:02:56.796 --> 01:02:58.601
I wasn't going to say anything.

01:02:58.767 --> 01:02:59.961
Alright, alright.

01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.699
So, do you want the bathroom first?

01:03:02.963 --> 01:03:05.942
-No, I can wait.
-No, no. No, no. You go.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.551
-Are.. are you sure?
-No. No. You go. Please... please.

01:03:39.577 --> 01:03:40.414
Your turn.

01:04:15.907 --> 01:04:18.334
-Tired?
-Not really.

01:04:19.049 --> 01:04:21.771
Me neither. These are nice.

01:04:22.584 --> 01:04:23.190
Nice.

01:04:25.934 --> 01:04:27.010
Do you want to watch some TV?

01:04:27.094 --> 01:04:29.982
Oh, sure. I have some tapes. Old movies.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.903
-Oh, great
-Oh, good.

01:04:34.406 --> 01:04:36.121
I brought... lets' see...

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:40.025
It Happened One Night,
Lawrence of Arabia, Now, Voyager?

01:04:40.264 --> 01:04:42.993
How about Lawrence of Arabia?
It's nice and long.

01:04:46.222 --> 01:04:51.943
Okay. Lawrence of Arabia it is.

01:04:52.252 --> 01:04:53.794
Just stick it in.

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:55.724
Right.

01:05:26.091 --> 01:05:29.630
-Is it over?
-Yeah. Go to sleep.

01:05:48.082 --> 01:05:49.769
Are you just looking or buying?

01:05:50.694 --> 01:05:52.734
Ummm... It all depends.

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:54.669
I'm not sure yet.

01:05:54.753 --> 01:05:56.725
So, how about you?
It seems to be going well.

01:05:56.939 --> 01:05:57.864
Better than that.

01:05:58.105 --> 01:06:01.604
-Have you two... uh...?
-No, and it's made a bit of difference.

01:06:01.688 --> 01:06:03.743
-I don't know how you do it,
but if it works,

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:07.574
-I'd give you both a lot of credit.
-Credit? Credit for what?

01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:10.865
Oh! I was just telling Henry how
sex isn't an issue for us.

01:06:11.113 --> 01:06:12.593
Um... it's true.

01:06:12.823 --> 01:06:15.516
I mean,
it's much less complicated this way,

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.482
not to mention sanitary.

01:07:02.336 --> 01:07:04.432
It feels so good to be writing again.

01:07:04.523 --> 01:07:06.619
I'm having so many
ideas for the new book!

01:07:06.703 --> 01:07:07.226
Oh, yeah?

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:09.152
I can't believe how easily it's coming.

01:07:09.236 --> 01:07:11.040
I have outlines for
three chapters already.

01:07:11.413 --> 01:07:12.140
That's great.

01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:15.623
What a terrific idea it was of yours,
Rose, to come here to the park.

01:07:15.707 --> 01:07:17.452
I've never written in the park.

01:07:17.573 --> 01:07:19.273
-It's wonderful.
-I'm glad.

01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:21.060
Another one of these.

01:07:22.373 --> 01:07:23.630
Is that Barry?

01:07:25.343 --> 01:07:26.223
I think it is.

01:07:27.424 --> 01:07:29.292
Hey! Barry?

01:07:30.694 --> 01:07:31.428
Barry?

01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:34.120
-Hi. It's Rose.
-It's Rose...

01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:36.235
-Hi! How are you?
-How are you?

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.695
-Good to see you.
-This is Gloria.

01:07:37.779 --> 01:07:38.244
Hello.

01:07:38.328 --> 01:07:40.827
Oh! This is my husband, Gregory Larkin.

01:07:41.359 --> 01:07:43.830
-Hello.
-Hi, Gregory. This is Gloria.

01:07:43.914 --> 01:07:46.335
I heard you got married.
Congratulations.

01:07:46.547 --> 01:07:49.997
Thank you. Gosh! You look good, Barry.

01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:51.779
Well, being engaged agrees with me.

01:07:51.948 --> 01:07:54.618
Engaged! Well, congratulations!

01:07:54.702 --> 01:07:57.142
Yeah, well, I finally found
somebody who didn't cancel on me.

01:07:57.226 --> 01:07:59.109
Will you please excuse me, please?
Nice to meet you.

01:07:59.193 --> 01:08:00.916
-It was nice to meet you too. Thanks.
-Bye.

01:08:05.577 --> 01:08:08.063
I'm really happy for you... both.

01:08:08.798 --> 01:08:12.139
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Rose. And take care.

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.107
You, too.

01:08:41.654 --> 01:08:42.828
Everything okay?

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.865
Yeah, everything's okay.

01:08:54.103 --> 01:08:54.618
What?

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:59.569
Well, the jeans and a T-shirt...
it's a great look on you.

01:08:59.653 --> 01:09:00.464
Mmmm... yeah?

01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:02.488
You should wear it to class sometime.

01:09:04.781 --> 01:09:06.545
Do you mind? I'd love to get the scores.

01:09:06.629 --> 01:09:09.837
No, no! You go ahead.
I'm Donna read the paper.

01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:12.084
Oh, I didn't tell you...

01:09:13.434 --> 01:09:15.359
I received a few invitations

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:17.947
from some European universities
to lecture on my book.

01:09:18.245 --> 01:09:19.087
Oh! That's nice.

01:09:19.171 --> 01:09:23.417
I told them, of course,
that I wanted to check with you first.

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:26.077
Sounds great. For how long?

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:29.263
Three months.
Starting in June after the term ends.

01:09:30.781 --> 01:09:31.649
Three months?

01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:36.844
All right, guys. Come on. Let's get
the rally going here.

01:09:36.926 --> 01:09:38.078
Come on. Come on.

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:41.112
I never could understand people's
fascination with baseball.

01:09:41.196 --> 01:09:42.895
I don't see the point of playing a game

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:45.145
where you wind up at the
same place you started.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.782
Well,
actually, this should interest you,

01:09:47.865 --> 01:09:50.819
because it's about stats and averages.

01:09:51.663 --> 01:09:53.497
Stats and averages? Explain that to me.

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.561
Well,
see that every time a player comes up,

01:09:56.644 --> 01:10:00.436
they flash a three-digit number.
And that is the player's average.

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.821
That is, how many times he hits the ball

01:10:02.905 --> 01:10:05.452
in ratio to how many
times he comes up to bat.

01:10:05.536 --> 01:10:06.448
No. Which number is this?

01:10:06.532 --> 01:10:10.438
An equation such as the second
derivative of the function F

01:10:10.522 --> 01:10:14.846
with respect to the variable
X equals a constant.

01:10:22.474 --> 01:10:24.449
Anybody see the game yesterday?

01:10:24.532 --> 01:10:26.508
That Marrakesh, what a bum, huh?

01:10:30.662 --> 01:10:33.143
Let me try putting this another way.

01:10:34.172 --> 01:10:36.016
Well, mainly trajectory,

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:40.041
if a batter hits a ball,
how can we determine how far it will go?

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:42.431
What are the variables
needed to hit a home run,

01:10:42.869 --> 01:10:45.481
pretending for a moment that
the bum could hit a home run?

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:49.943
The velocity with which
the ball leaves the bat?

01:10:50.276 --> 01:10:53.258
-The velocity, correct.
-I have a question.

01:10:53.911 --> 01:10:56.713
Does a rising fastball really rise?

01:11:01.015 --> 01:11:02.952
I don't know. I'll have to ask my wife.

01:11:06.314 --> 01:11:07.684
I could not believe it.

01:11:08.117 --> 01:11:12.613
Suddenly, the room was filled
with this... uh... tangible energy.

01:11:12.697 --> 01:11:18.216
We were actually exchanging ideas.
We were connected somehow.

01:11:18.868 --> 01:11:22.947
They participated,
they questioned, they stayed!

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.849
Rose, I cannot thank you enough.

01:11:26.933 --> 01:11:30.305
I was a better teacher today,
than I've ever been, because of you.

01:11:30.389 --> 01:11:32.702
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:35.584
Fresh pepper?

01:11:35.897 --> 01:11:38.380
No. She doesn't care for pepper,
but I'll have some.

01:11:40.294 --> 01:11:44.297
Oh! And could you bring her a
little side dish of dressing?

01:11:44.899 --> 01:11:46.695
She likes a little extra. Thank you.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.173
So, I kinda feel I should
return the favours.

01:11:52.257 --> 01:11:53.900
Is there anything
that I can do for you?

01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:56.392
Anything that you want from me?

01:12:03.274 --> 01:12:04.915
I'll have to think about that.

01:12:05.367 --> 01:12:08.299
-Ma'am.
-Okay Just glop it on.

01:12:12.181 --> 01:12:13.399
Enjoy your dinner.

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:20.332
-You're not eating.
-No, I'm watching your ritual.

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.303
My... what?

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.027
Your ritual. I just about got
your sequence now, I think.

01:12:25.359 --> 01:12:26.232
My sequence?

01:12:26.316 --> 01:12:30.781
Yes. You always start out by
rotating the plate counter-clockwise,

01:12:31.879 --> 01:12:36.764
cut on the diagonal,
remove unwanted elements,

01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:44.094
and now, I believe, comes my favourite
part, the loading of the fork.

01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:48.400
I find it just fascinating,
the percentages that you use

01:12:48.483 --> 01:12:53.971
of different vegetables to create
that one harmoniously balanced,

01:12:54.165 --> 01:12:56.193
perfect bite.

01:12:58.423 --> 01:12:59.257
Mmm.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.131
You have a little...

01:13:20.812 --> 01:13:21.678
Don't smear it.

01:13:31.876 --> 01:13:34.919
That might stain. You might want
to put a little soap on that.

01:13:36.908 --> 01:13:40.368
I'll be right back.

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:02.309
Mmm.

01:14:05.265 --> 01:14:06.672
I want to ask you something.

01:14:06.862 --> 01:14:07.617
Just to make sure I've...

01:14:07.728 --> 01:14:11.273
-Come on. Don't stop.
-What do you think? I'm a machine?

01:14:11.357 --> 01:14:13.166
It is true...

01:14:13.806 --> 01:14:15.760
This overwhelming feeling
we have for each other,

01:14:15.843 --> 01:14:17.627
it is true for you,
as it is for me, isn't it?

01:14:18.411 --> 01:14:20.716
Come on, come on, you're doing great.
Keep it up.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.562
Okay. Ready?

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:28.263
Doesn't that music infuriate you?

01:14:28.347 --> 01:14:30.050
Yeah, I'm livid.

01:14:31.844 --> 01:14:35.712
Rose, I came by your office today

01:14:35.991 --> 01:14:38.332
to take you out to lunch,
and you weren't there.

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:40.601
Where were you?
At a staff meeting or something?

01:14:40.692 --> 01:14:42.249
No. I had lunch with Henry.

01:14:44.597 --> 01:14:47.563
Rose, he's a friend of mine,

01:14:47.647 --> 01:14:49.196
but you have to watch out for him.

01:14:50.329 --> 01:14:51.779
Believe me, I'm not his type.

01:14:51.923 --> 01:14:55.678
No, no, no. I'm sure he is.
He has trouble controlling himself.

01:14:55.761 --> 01:14:57.312
-Oh.
-What? What? What?

01:14:58.308 --> 01:15:00.318
Did you pull something?
-I think so.

01:15:00.402 --> 01:15:02.623
-Where?
-Right here.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.117
-Right here?
-Yeah. A little lower.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:10.688
Lower.
Closer to the spine. Oh, there. Yeah.

01:15:11.767 --> 01:15:13.244
Oh, yeah.

01:15:16.497 --> 01:15:17.746
Lean back into it.

01:15:20.268 --> 01:15:22.228
You know, I was thinking.

01:15:22.534 --> 01:15:24.458
Maybe you'd like to meet me in
Europe

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:26.005
after your summer classes end.

01:15:26.492 --> 01:15:29.590
We never had any kind
of honeymoon vacation.

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:33.011
That's right.
I would... gosh I would love that.

01:15:34.258 --> 01:15:36.409
-Would you?
-Mmm.

01:15:40.098 --> 01:15:45.557
-Am I pressing too much?
-No, no. Just that I'm all sweaty and...

01:15:46.782 --> 01:15:48.102
I have to floss.

01:15:53.161 --> 01:15:55.137
When you've got to floss,
you've got to floss.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.258
Claire, I don't know how to ask for it.

01:16:09.574 --> 01:16:11.182
And we were so polite to each other,

01:16:11.265 --> 01:16:13.476
sometimes I feel like we're
room-mates in a charm school.

01:16:13.559 --> 01:16:15.949
Wait. Hold on a sec.
I gotta put you on the speaker.

01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:19.774
I am so frustrated, Claire.
I don't know what to do.

01:16:19.864 --> 01:16:23.518
You might ask him. Give him a look
and let him know you want sex.

01:16:23.602 --> 01:16:25.778
I tried that once. He thought
there was something in my eye.

01:16:26.555 --> 01:16:28.897
I'm talking about a look
that generates some heat.

01:16:29.072 --> 01:16:31.223
God! You know, sometimes, I swear

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:33.176
he feels something too.
I'm just not sure.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:35.647
Men aren't that bright, Rose. It's easy.

01:16:36.079 --> 01:16:38.753
Be subtle, mysterious, seductive.

01:16:39.054 --> 01:16:41.170
Subtle, mysterious, seductive?

01:16:41.777 --> 01:16:43.354
Why don't men come with instructions?

01:16:43.438 --> 01:16:45.044
-It'll be fine.
-I... I..

01:16:51.165 --> 01:16:52.095
More coffee?

01:16:52.478 --> 01:16:55.869
Yeah.
Thanks. Well, my tickets just arrived.

01:16:56.325 --> 01:17:00.273
My first lecture is in Paris
on the 24th. I leave Saturday.

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:03.271
Greg, do you want an
English muffin or anything?

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:04.744
No. No, thanks.

01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:08.115
Alright. Well, I have to go.
I have an early class.

01:17:08.331 --> 01:17:10.046
All right. Have a nice day.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.488
-Oh, by the way...
-Mmm?

01:17:17.791 --> 01:17:19.391
Would telling you now that I'd like sex

01:17:19.474 --> 01:17:20.980
tonight be enough of a warning?

01:17:24.698 --> 01:17:27.767
Or should we wait till you come back
from Europe?

01:17:28.204 --> 01:17:29.385
Yeah, right? That's better.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:33.989
No, no... That's fine.

01:17:37.482 --> 01:17:42.249
All right.
I guess I'll see you tonight.

01:17:45.087 --> 01:17:46.269
Have a nice day.

01:17:53.205 --> 01:17:55.223
Have you ever tried making love?

01:17:55.307 --> 01:17:58.269
Well, that's just it. Our
relationship was never based on that.

01:17:59.627 --> 01:18:02.194
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.

01:18:02.723 --> 01:18:05.075
Having sex now will ruin everything.

01:18:06.331 --> 01:18:08.593
You're a very sick man. You know that.

01:18:20.364 --> 01:18:20.967
Mmm.

01:18:24.931 --> 01:18:26.222
Johnson's been around both leagues,

01:18:26.306 --> 01:18:28.008
but seems to have found
a home here in the Bronx.

01:18:28.092 --> 01:18:32.249
He's leading the American league
with a 2.34 ERA and 24 strikeouts.

01:18:33.705 --> 01:18:37.044
And strike three. That makes
strikeout number 25 for Johnson

01:18:37.128 --> 01:18:37.946
in this young season.

01:18:40.653 --> 01:18:41.995
I have the game on for you.

01:18:44.235 --> 01:18:46.102
Oh. Great.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.344
Some wine?

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.678
Oh, I don't know Rose.
I'll wake up with a headache.

01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:57.351
-One glass.
-All right, one glass.

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.331
Same score?

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:15.647
This is good. Sweet.
I normally don't like sweet, but...

01:19:16.408 --> 01:19:17.654
this is good.

01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:21.987
I'm glad you like it. Do you...

01:19:25.805 --> 01:19:29.117
Would you mind terribly
if we muted the TV?

01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:38.443
What are you doing?

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.240
Nothing much.

01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:45.965
All right.

01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:50.780
Would it be all right if I sat down?

01:20:03.152 --> 01:20:07.299
-That wine made me warm.
-I can fix that.

01:20:07.383 --> 01:20:08.140
It's okay.

01:20:13.956 --> 01:20:14.643
Good game?

01:20:16.326 --> 01:20:17.043
I can't hear.

01:20:27.567 --> 01:20:30.367
Rose. Oh! Oh! Ah!

01:20:31.184 --> 01:20:33.395
No. That's all right. That's all right.
No, no...

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.664
Did I hurt you?
-No, no, Rose. No. You didn't hurt me.

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:38.637
No. You missed. You didn't spill a drop.

01:20:40.194 --> 01:20:41.022
I guess...

01:20:41.106 --> 01:20:45.207
That's funny?
I guess that's kinda funny.

01:20:47.808 --> 01:20:51.183
Do you think we could turn the TV off?

01:20:57.323 --> 01:20:58.043
That's better.

01:20:59.411 --> 01:21:00.880
We have to relax.

01:21:02.081 --> 01:21:03.373
I agree.

01:21:09.654 --> 01:21:11.059
How... how are classes?

01:21:12.217 --> 01:21:13.127
Going well.

01:21:14.144 --> 01:21:18.702
-And your book? How's that...
-The outline is actually...

01:21:22.914 --> 01:21:24.547
It's coming along.

01:21:26.401 --> 01:21:27.651
It's almost there.

01:21:29.066 --> 01:21:33.464
It's not at all what I expected.
It's harder than I thought.

01:21:35.297 --> 01:21:38.330
But I'll... I'll...

01:21:39.307 --> 01:21:41.908
-I'm sure that I'll...
-Are you sure...

01:21:42.057 --> 01:21:44.660
sure, I'll... get there.

01:21:46.654 --> 01:21:47.875
I want you to get there.

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:00.570
What did you say?

01:22:02.903 --> 01:22:04.969
-Rose.
-Talk to me.

01:22:30.982 --> 01:22:33.936
-Oh, yes. Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.650
Oh, God. Oh, Rose.

01:22:37.511 --> 01:22:38.538
Oh, god.

01:22:38.734 --> 01:22:41.132
-No, no, no.
-Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:41.216 --> 01:22:42.141
No, no.

01:22:42.782 --> 01:22:45.123
-I don't want to do this!
-What?

01:22:45.207 --> 01:22:46.255
I'm sorry, Rose.

01:22:51.745 --> 01:22:53.058
Oh!

01:23:26.029 --> 01:23:31.266
And, yeah. I have to say,
Rose, I'm a little confused.

01:23:31.349 --> 01:23:33.110
A little disappointed.

01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:39.191
Everything was going so well.

01:23:40.911 --> 01:23:42.613
At least, I thought so. Didn't you?

01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:47.858
Why? Is that the truth or just some
kind of female manipulation?

01:23:48.503 --> 01:23:50.855
I wish...
I wish you'd just tell me the truth.

01:23:51.455 --> 01:23:54.285
You knew the arrangement.
You knew how I felt.

01:23:54.615 --> 01:23:56.110
Did you think that would change?

01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:58.079
Why?

01:24:01.128 --> 01:24:04.739
I hoped, that even though
I initially made the offer,

01:24:04.823 --> 01:24:07.538
that I know you would have seen
that there was no need for it.

01:24:07.622 --> 01:24:09.314
I'd hoped that we'd gone beyond it.

01:24:10.781 --> 01:24:12.739
Did you honestly think
this was the next step?

01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:19.694
Rose, you have it all backwards.
You know, what we have,

01:24:19.778 --> 01:24:21.941
usually comes
after all this nonsense is over.

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:24.059
Most people never get to where we are

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.844
in regards to sharing and respect.

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:27.789
Instead,
they try to keep the sex going.

01:24:27.873 --> 01:24:30.514
And when that fades,
they just move on to someone new.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.681
That's why...
that's why our relationship works,

01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:34.951
because it was never physical.

01:24:35.034 --> 01:24:36.429
I took every precaution to make sure

01:24:36.513 --> 01:24:38.109
there was no physical attraction!

01:24:42.393 --> 01:24:45.174
Rose... Rose, I'm sorry.

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:46.987
Rose?

01:24:49.658 --> 01:24:50.598
It's just...

01:24:51.839 --> 01:24:53.671
I've never had this
with a woman before.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:57.159
The way I can talk I can talk about it,
share everything with you.

01:25:01.215 --> 01:25:04.379
Are you...
are you not satisfied with me?

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:06.675
Rose?

01:25:08.516 --> 01:25:10.854
Maybe...
maybe this is something we have to come

01:25:10.938 --> 01:25:13.048
up with something to
struggle through together.

01:25:14.393 --> 01:25:17.856
Maybe... maybe this lecture tour is
coming at a good time.

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:22.017
Maybe we can use some distance
from each other for a while.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.098
Don't you think?

01:25:25.798 --> 01:25:27.378
I thought we were good friends.

01:25:29.581 --> 01:25:31.807
Talk to me, Rose.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:35.874
Rose, come on. Let me in. I'm sorry.

01:25:41.605 --> 01:25:43.223
Come on. Open the door.

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.969
Open the door, please.

01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:55.085
Come on, Rose.

01:27:11.146 --> 01:27:12.350
What are you doing here?

01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:20.880
I just came to sleep in my own bed.
Is that okay?

01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.938
What happened? Is it Gregory?

01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:28.876
I don't want to say I told you so,
but...

01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:32.893
-Mom.
-What?

01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:35.981
When I was a baby,

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.602
did you think I was pretty?

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.737
I don't know what you mean.
All babies are pretty.

01:27:46.206 --> 01:27:49.511
No. No, I mean me.

01:27:54.725 --> 01:27:57.212
You must have thought
something about how I looked.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.244
What's pretty, anyway?

01:28:03.424 --> 01:28:04.923
What good did it do your sister?

01:28:14.403 --> 01:28:15.487
Do you remember...

01:28:17.087 --> 01:28:18.207
when I was a little girl?

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:22.644
You told me to...

01:28:23.597 --> 01:28:26.664
push my nose up
with my index finger.

01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:29.010
So it wouldn't droop.

01:28:29.549 --> 01:28:31.664
I did not! Are you drunk?

01:28:33.327 --> 01:28:34.390
That's what you told me.

01:28:35.115 --> 01:28:36.760
It's funny too because,

01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:42.137
I never would have thought
that I wasn't pretty

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.437
if it weren't for
those things you said.

01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:51.458
If you came to say more cruel
things to me, I'm going to bed.

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:54.123
-Mom?
-What?

01:28:57.313 --> 01:28:58.240
How did it feel?

01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:00.603
How did what feel?

01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:02.716
Being beautiful?

01:29:03.651 --> 01:29:05.543
-Oh, shut up.
-No, I mean it.

01:29:06.887 --> 01:29:10.272
How did it feel having
people look at you

01:29:12.111 --> 01:29:13.459
with such admiration?

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:17.939
Looking at yourself in the mirror

01:29:21.621 --> 01:29:23.041
with such appreciation?

01:29:26.766 --> 01:29:27.781
How did that feel?

01:29:38.057 --> 01:29:38.905
It was wonderful.

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:52.682
I bet.

01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:02.504
Hello.

01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.973
Hi, Hannah.
This is Gregory. Is Rose there?

01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:08.416
No.
She's gone out. Can I take a message?

01:30:08.915 --> 01:30:11.651
No. Hannah, the point is that I've been

01:30:11.734 --> 01:30:13.532
giving you messages,
and she hasn't called back.

01:30:13.616 --> 01:30:15.497
I want to say goodbye to my wife.

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:17.741
I'll tell her.

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:33.100
Rose,
I hated the way we left each other.

01:30:33.955 --> 01:30:35.491
I wanted to say goodbye
to you personally,

01:30:35.575 --> 01:30:36.496
not through your mother.

01:30:38.493 --> 01:30:41.941
I don't like leaving this way,
but my plane is here.

01:30:43.123 --> 01:30:45.889
I hope your mother doesn't
erase this message.

01:30:49.469 --> 01:30:51.422
I don't know what else to say.

01:30:55.191 --> 01:30:57.861
Rose, I hated the way we left each other

01:30:58.226 --> 01:30:59.970
I wanted to say goodbye
to you personally,

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:00.617
not through your mother.

01:31:15.025 --> 01:31:16.083
You're up early.

01:31:18.101 --> 01:31:19.612
I haven't been to bed.

01:31:22.012 --> 01:31:24.112
-You haven't been to bed?
-No.

01:31:26.955 --> 01:31:27.901
Why not?

01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:34.054
Listen I... I had a lot to think
about after you left.

01:31:36.196 --> 01:31:38.618
It's awful thing to do to a woman my
age

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.751
and leave her alone with her thoughts.

01:31:48.087 --> 01:31:49.770
You really love him, don't you?

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:56.533
You do, it's obvious.

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.161
That... that feeling

01:32:06.203 --> 01:32:07.669
you have for Gregory,

01:32:12.187 --> 01:32:14.594
I don't think I ever felt that.

01:32:17.245 --> 01:32:18.921
Not even for your father.

01:32:22.483 --> 01:32:25.105
It's not...
not as easy thing for me to say,

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:28.024
especially to you.

01:32:31.124 --> 01:32:33.983
It's awful to look back on your life

01:32:36.028 --> 01:32:38.100
and realize that you've settled.

01:32:40.919 --> 01:32:45.156
The problem was that I
always felt I had more time.

01:32:45.316 --> 01:32:46.394
I was...

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:52.360
Now, inside, I feel young.

01:32:52.675 --> 01:32:53.839
Like a kid that's...

01:32:54.693 --> 01:32:55.889
just beginning.

01:32:56.697 --> 01:32:58.348
I have everything ahead of me.

01:33:00.424 --> 01:33:01.155
But I don't.

01:33:04.507 --> 01:33:09.521
So I guess I am jealous.

01:33:12.928 --> 01:33:16.372
Parents don't have a plan

01:33:16.456 --> 01:33:18.906
to hurt their children.

01:33:21.047 --> 01:33:22.883
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:33:23.976 --> 01:33:25.038
Mom,

01:33:27.332 --> 01:33:28.578
I'm not that hurt.

01:33:30.569 --> 01:33:32.709
Do you know what I thought
when you were a baby?

01:33:33.004 --> 01:33:33.464
What?

01:33:35.064 --> 01:33:37.231
That you looked just like your father

01:33:38.614 --> 01:33:39.981
and that Claire looked like me.

01:33:42.043 --> 01:33:42.838
What's that?

01:33:48.655 --> 01:33:50.803
She was so pretty, even then.

01:33:51.802 --> 01:33:53.137
Look at those eyes.

01:33:53.841 --> 01:33:55.143
Those lips.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.539
That's not Claire, that's you.

01:33:59.197 --> 01:34:02.425
Me? I never saw this picture.

01:34:04.119 --> 01:34:06.624
You know, I found it when I
was rearranging the closet.

01:34:06.838 --> 01:34:08.642
-This was me?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:34:10.587 --> 01:34:12.316
I... I was pretty?

01:34:14.166 --> 01:34:15.726
Your father adored you,

01:34:16.979 --> 01:34:18.171
but you know that.

01:34:18.714 --> 01:34:20.656
He never felt that way about Claire.

01:34:21.578 --> 01:34:22.574
Only you.

01:34:24.301 --> 01:34:27.377
I don't think he ever held
a baby until you came.

01:34:29.509 --> 01:34:31.347
He never wanted to let you go.

01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:41.125
-I'm glad you found this, mom.
-Yes. I am too.

01:34:45.103 --> 01:34:46.444
She was very pretty.

01:34:48.174 --> 01:34:49.206
You were very pretty.

01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:53.264
Remember that.

01:34:59.875 --> 01:35:00.828
Yeah.

01:35:54.559 --> 01:35:56.756
Thank you all,
very much, for your warm welcome.

01:35:57.027 --> 01:36:00.278
It's truly an honour for me
to be here in your country.

01:36:00.362 --> 01:36:03.749
Hello,
Rose, I'd love to speak with you.

01:36:04.549 --> 01:36:06.175
I never seem to catch you at home.

01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:08.766
I really think we should discuss this,
Rose.

01:36:08.849 --> 01:36:11.597
And believe me,
I have no judgement over what happened.

01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:13.115
I just think that we should talk.

01:36:13.328 --> 01:36:14.889
I'm leaving for Venice tomorrow,

01:36:14.972 --> 01:36:17.256
and I wanted to wish
you a happy birthday.

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:22.306
I do have a present for you.
It's a week at a baseball camp.

01:36:22.682 --> 01:36:23.816
Rose.

01:36:34.954 --> 01:36:36.502
Hello, Rose?

01:36:40.137 --> 01:36:41.604
Rose, are you there?

01:36:47.063 --> 01:36:48.899
Henry, have you heard from her?

01:36:48.983 --> 01:36:51.227
She apparently cancelled
her summer classes.

01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:53.271
-How do you know that?
-I called her mother.

01:36:53.355 --> 01:36:55.545
She said Rose took a
couple of months off.

01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:58.315
Rose/ Here, try this one.
It's an eight.

01:36:58.692 --> 01:37:01.373
I like the black one
and I need a size six.

01:37:02.868 --> 01:37:06.876
Hello.
Rose, I have to say, I'm very surprised.

01:37:06.959 --> 01:37:08.938
I can't believe how
childishly you're behaving.

01:37:09.022 --> 01:37:10.173
It's unlike you.

01:37:10.345 --> 01:37:12.572
How did she finally
persuade you to tell me?

01:37:12.732 --> 01:37:14.250
It's a long story.

01:37:14.773 --> 01:37:17.994
I'm changing my plans.
I'm coming home right after London.

01:37:18.313 --> 01:37:20.329
I'm supposed to be in
New York next Monday.

01:37:20.472 --> 01:37:27.412
My number here is 01-71-257-7355.

01:37:28.853 --> 01:37:30.658
All prime numbers, by the way.

01:37:44.882 --> 01:37:45.586
Hello?

01:37:59.849 --> 01:38:01.960
Rose? Are you here?

01:38:09.157 --> 01:38:13.758
-Rose?
-Hi! Don't come in. I'll be right out.

01:38:37.377 --> 01:38:40.777
May I have a glass, too, please?

01:39:03.802 --> 01:39:06.919
Good to see you, Greg.
How was your trip?

01:39:12.090 --> 01:39:13.232
Are you all right?

01:39:14.294 --> 01:39:16.337
Oh, just a little busy. The uh...

01:39:16.562 --> 01:39:18.272
travelling doesn't agree with me.

01:39:19.463 --> 01:39:20.646
You need a glass of water?

01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:25.339
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. I just made a few changes.

01:39:26.259 --> 01:39:29.065
-What did you do to your hair?
-I lightened it.

01:39:29.514 --> 01:39:30.741
Your face?

01:39:33.469 --> 01:39:34.661
And you're wearing make-up.

01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:39.064
Yeah. Well,
women do wear make-up from time to time.

01:39:39.533 --> 01:39:41.455
It's not like I had surgery or anything,
but...

01:39:41.539 --> 01:39:42.848
although my mother offered.

01:39:43.328 --> 01:39:44.347
You never...

01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:47.464
-Are you hungry?
-You never wore make-up.

01:39:48.250 --> 01:39:51.406
I know. The no-frills girl. Right?

01:39:51.606 --> 01:39:54.037
Well,
like I said, I made a few changes.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.853
-And you lost weight, too?
-Thank you.

01:39:57.055 --> 01:39:59.144
Now, these have no oil or butter.

01:39:59.228 --> 01:40:01.644
Trust me. It's delicious.
You got to get used to it.

01:40:01.728 --> 01:40:04.446
Among other things, what have you done?

01:40:04.778 --> 01:40:07.882
What have I done. I'm wearing make-up.
I lost a few pounds.

01:40:07.965 --> 01:40:09.908
I didn't name names
before a senate committee.

01:40:10.039 --> 01:40:12.460
Well, forgive me.
But you don't return my calls,

01:40:12.544 --> 01:40:16.222
you completely cut me off,
and then I return to find this. I'm...

01:40:19.175 --> 01:40:20.413
Uh, I'm...

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.087
-What?
-Speechless.

01:40:25.806 --> 01:40:30.580
-I guess you don't like it.
-Don't like it? I'm in shock.

01:40:31.186 --> 01:40:34.427
I come home to find a completely
different woman in my apartment.

01:40:34.534 --> 01:40:35.440
Why did you do it?

01:40:35.974 --> 01:40:39.006
Wait a minute. Why do I have to
explain this to you or anybody?

01:40:39.106 --> 01:40:40.774
I'm not anybody. I'm your husband.

01:40:40.858 --> 01:40:41.521
#

01:40:41.605 --> 01:40:44.181
And I married a woman
who looked a certain way.

01:40:44.698 --> 01:40:48.155
To tell you the truth,
I feel sort of betrayed.

01:40:48.279 --> 01:40:50.678
Betrayed? Oh, please! Gregory. Come on.

01:40:50.762 --> 01:40:53.015
-You had no right.
-I had no right?

01:40:53.652 --> 01:40:54.791
Why did you do this to me?

01:40:55.036 --> 01:40:57.554
Do what to you?
I don't do anything to you.

01:40:57.638 --> 01:41:00.294
That's the problem.
What's the difference what I look like?

01:41:00.378 --> 01:41:01.749
You never look at me anyhow.

01:41:02.166 --> 01:41:03.814
If physical appearance doesn't matter,

01:41:03.897 --> 01:41:05.523
then what's wrong with this appearance?

01:41:05.764 --> 01:41:07.477
I happen to like the way I look.

01:41:07.944 --> 01:41:11.147
And I'm sorry if it upsets your
mathematical equation.

01:41:11.267 --> 01:41:14.882
'Handsome, frightened man marries
unattractive, desperate woman.'

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:16.309
Is that how the ads read?

01:41:16.393 --> 01:41:19.904
No. No. It's simply that I
was expecting someone else.

01:41:20.363 --> 01:41:24.323
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.
I'll just have to get used to it.

01:41:24.448 --> 01:41:25.155
No, you don't.

01:41:26.894 --> 01:41:30.240
-You don't have to get used to anything.
-What do you mean?

01:41:30.789 --> 01:41:34.240
Gregory, I don't want to continue.

01:41:36.317 --> 01:41:37.994
I don't understand.

01:41:40.013 --> 01:41:43.775
I... I really want to apologize.

01:41:44.642 --> 01:41:48.011
I... settled for something
that I didn't want.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.010
I thought I could live with that.
I though it would be enough. But...

01:41:52.319 --> 01:41:55.576
I lied.
I lied to myself. I lied to you.

01:41:56.157 --> 01:41:58.964
To tell you the truth,
I think your theories

01:41:59.047 --> 01:42:01.597
about relationships are total bullshit.

01:42:02.098 --> 01:42:05.436
I believe in love and
lust and sex and romance,

01:42:05.601 --> 01:42:08.757
I don't want everything to
add up to some perfect equation.

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.795
I want mess and chaos.

01:42:10.878 --> 01:42:13.525
I want someone
to go crazy... out of his mind for me.

01:42:14.099 --> 01:42:17.349
I want to feel passion and
heat and sweat and madness!

01:42:17.433 --> 01:42:19.731
I want Valentines and cupids
an all the rest of that crap!

01:42:19.814 --> 01:42:22.596
I want it all, and I want to thank you.

01:42:22.795 --> 01:42:25.750
I want to thank you Greg,
because you forced me

01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:29.328
to look at things I was too
lazy or too scared to look at.

01:42:29.806 --> 01:42:31.914
I mean, can you imagine, all this
time I...

01:42:32.252 --> 01:42:35.764
I kept up this ridiculous fantasy that
you, like Alex,

01:42:35.848 --> 01:42:36.960
would fall in love with me.

01:42:37.044 --> 01:42:38.599
-Rose?
-I know. I know. I know.

01:42:38.683 --> 01:42:40.636
I was wrong. It was unfair of me
to think that you would change...

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.957
Rose! Rose! But I think...

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.513
I know what you think, Gregory.
And just let me finish.

01:42:44.597 --> 01:42:46.838
Rose, Rose, Rose, I feel...

01:42:46.921 --> 01:42:50.147
You feel very strongly about
your beliefs. I appreciate that.

01:42:50.428 --> 01:42:51.962
I'm sorry that I broke our agreement.

01:42:52.046 --> 01:42:54.685
It was just that I fell in
love with you. Stupid. Right?

01:42:54.784 --> 01:42:57.243
Rose! Rose... I feel...

01:42:57.343 --> 01:42:59.416
I don't want you to feel.
But it's all right now,

01:42:59.892 --> 01:43:01.705
because I'm not in
love with you any more.

01:43:05.389 --> 01:43:06.072
What?

01:43:07.938 --> 01:43:10.176
Which ironically,
now makes me perfect for this marriage,

01:43:10.266 --> 01:43:11.613
but now I don't want it.

01:43:19.145 --> 01:43:23.623
Suddenly, dinner doesn't
seem like such a good idea.

01:43:27.129 --> 01:43:30.059
I should... I should go.

01:43:31.404 --> 01:43:34.699
Where are you going?
Your mother's?

01:43:34.849 --> 01:43:36.609
Just until I find my own place.

01:43:39.452 --> 01:43:43.990
I hope at some point we can pick
up where we left off as friends.

01:43:44.504 --> 01:43:45.121
Friends?

01:43:45.205 --> 01:43:46.637
I really just thank you, Greg.

01:43:47.009 --> 01:43:50.980
You're the first man who wanted
to marry me for any reason.

01:43:54.613 --> 01:43:56.174
Can I call you tomorrow?

01:43:59.885 --> 01:44:00.723
What for?

01:44:04.535 --> 01:44:05.542
Oh.

01:44:25.422 --> 01:44:27.746
You all have copies of the syllabus?,
right

01:44:27.933 --> 01:44:28.579
Yes.

01:44:28.663 --> 01:44:32.094
There will be four short
papers on this time... text...

01:44:32.258 --> 01:44:36.061
Be prepared to also
discuss these in class.

01:44:36.145 --> 01:44:39.465
Now, some of my students from last term

01:44:39.997 --> 01:44:44.284
can tell you how important
these oral sessions are.

01:44:45.488 --> 01:44:46.488
in... uh...

01:44:47.647 --> 01:44:48.685
What? What?

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.472
Yes, I have breasts.

01:44:53.522 --> 01:44:56.492
They cannot, however,
be the subject of one of your papers.

01:44:57.266 --> 01:44:57.879
Now...

01:44:58.106 --> 01:45:00.384
Hey! A double play!

01:45:00.795 --> 01:45:02.648
Well, of course,
I'll miss spending time with her,

01:45:02.732 --> 01:45:06.013
but I feel proud that
I stood up for what I believe.

01:45:06.097 --> 01:45:07.808
It felt like I was right.
It could have worked.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:10.604
Obviously not with her,
but...

01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:12.874
I think it was an
invaluable experience.

01:45:15.198 --> 01:45:16.955
You're in pretty bad shape, aren't you?

01:45:18.332 --> 01:45:20.907
-What I just told you...
-May I make a suggestion?

01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:23.207
Put all your valuable
possessions...

01:45:23.290 --> 01:45:25.687
things you really care about...
in storage.

01:45:26.746 --> 01:45:27.471
Why?

01:45:28.050 --> 01:45:28.956
Trust me on this.

01:45:29.039 --> 01:45:30.969
You don't want anything
breakable in your apartment.

01:45:31.053 --> 01:45:34.156
Henry, Henry...
I just told you, I'm fine.

01:45:34.283 --> 01:45:37.463
Really. I'm actually using
all of this in my next book.

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.391
Especially glass.

01:45:41.309 --> 01:45:44.728
I miss him, Claire.
But I don't think he's ready for me.

01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:49.890
I still can't get used to seeing you
like this.

01:45:50.562 --> 01:45:52.940
-It's sort of unnerving.
-Thanks.

01:45:53.858 --> 01:45:56.376
Makes you just like the rest of us
now, doesn't it?

01:45:56.729 --> 01:45:57.469
You'll see.

01:45:58.535 --> 01:46:00.830
Now, you'll spend an extra
hour in front of the mirror,

01:46:00.913 --> 01:46:03.962
every morning and every night,
as if it'll make any difference.

01:46:04.686 --> 01:46:07.721
Now, you'll be the one to
walk into a room and scan it

01:46:07.804 --> 01:46:09.991
for who looks better
than you and who doesn't.

01:46:10.687 --> 01:46:13.707
Ans as the years go by,
the numbers change.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.461
Until one day, you walk into a room

01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:19.660
and you're the last
woman any man notices.

01:46:21.653 --> 01:46:26.416
Rose? My God! Rose!

01:46:26.902 --> 01:46:30.459
-Hi, Alex.
-I can't believe it's you.

01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:32.271
My God!

01:46:32.404 --> 01:46:35.581
-Alex, get a fucking grip.
-You look incredible.

01:46:35.665 --> 01:46:36.928
-Thank you.
-Doesn't she look incredible?

01:46:37.012 --> 01:46:40.655
-Yes, we already covered that.
-Oh, yes...

01:47:15.591 --> 01:47:17.635
-I thought you hated salad.
-I do.

01:47:18.178 --> 01:47:20.313
I just can't eat a sick cheeseburger

01:47:20.396 --> 01:47:22.369
in the middle of the day any more,
you know?

01:47:22.822 --> 01:47:24.779
-Doesn't it bloat you?
-Bloat me?

01:47:24.863 --> 01:47:27.193
-Yeah.
-No. I doesn't bloat me.

01:47:27.277 --> 01:47:29.597
Actually, I thought it went really well

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.554
with the spare ribs
I had for breakfast.

01:47:37.655 --> 01:47:40.667
-What's the matter?
-I'm sorry.

01:47:42.854 --> 01:47:44.654
I just thought we'd always
be in the same boat.

01:47:44.737 --> 01:47:45.768
You know what I'm saying?

01:47:46.681 --> 01:47:48.310
It made it easier, somehow.

01:47:54.746 --> 01:47:55.665
I'll tell you what.

01:47:57.601 --> 01:48:00.490
I'll give you half my salad if
you give me half your burger.

01:48:03.898 --> 01:48:07.768
-We'll need some more dressing.
-Definitely. Waiter!

01:48:08.162 --> 01:48:11.194
We all want to be attractive,
but remember,

01:48:11.867 --> 01:48:14.408
one of the first things people notice...

01:48:15.058 --> 01:48:18.118
the one thing that makes
a lasting impression...

01:48:18.202 --> 01:48:20.794
is your smile.

01:48:22.564 --> 01:48:23.816
If you're like most people,

01:48:23.899 --> 01:48:25.929
your appearance is
probably important to you.

01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:29.551
We all spend so much time,
energy and money

01:48:29.634 --> 01:48:31.636
in an effort to look our best.

01:48:31.719 --> 01:48:33.710
We all want to be attractive.

01:48:42.628 --> 01:48:43.304
Ugh.

01:48:54.612 --> 01:48:55.291
Hello.

01:48:55.505 --> 01:48:57.857
-Hello, it's Alex.
-Oh, hi Al.

01:48:58.180 --> 01:48:59.233
How are you?

01:48:59.513 --> 01:49:02.844
Oh, I'm okay. I'm...
trying to get on with my life, you know?

01:49:02.928 --> 01:49:03.494
Oh, good, good.

01:49:03.578 --> 01:49:05.593
-What's wrong with you? You don't...
-Claire's gone.

01:49:05.677 --> 01:49:07.074
-Gone?
-Yeah.

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:08.576
Gone where?

01:49:10.187 --> 01:49:12.006
I came home to surprise her at lunch

01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:14.462
and found her in bed with her masseur.

01:49:16.454 --> 01:49:19.790
It's my own fault, really.
Claire hates surprises.

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:23.582
-Alex, I'm really sorry.
-No, I knew it was coming.

01:49:24.794 --> 01:49:26.543
I don't know why she wasn't happy.

01:49:27.606 --> 01:49:29.754
I couldn't have loved
her more than I did.

01:49:30.366 --> 01:49:32.791
I don't think it would have
mattered how much you loved her.

01:49:33.743 --> 01:49:34.823
-Rose...
-Mmm-hmm...

01:49:35.451 --> 01:49:37.512
Did you know that Claire
was jealous of you.

01:49:38.546 --> 01:49:41.193
-Uh... what? Jealous of me?
-Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.832
She used to get so mad at me
every time I'd talk about you.

01:49:44.512 --> 01:49:46.374
She thought I had a
secret crush on you.

01:49:48.869 --> 01:49:49.888
Maybe she was right.

01:49:56.001 --> 01:49:57.355
Do you want to have dinner with me?

01:49:58.802 --> 01:49:59.302
What?

01:50:00.964 --> 01:50:02.578
Well, I'm asking you if you
want to have dinner with me.

01:50:03.315 --> 01:50:04.233
I, uh...

01:50:05.555 --> 01:50:07.469
I have to... I have to think about it.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.343
-I'll have to ask Claire.
-Alright.

01:50:10.943 --> 01:50:11.603
Okay.

01:50:12.426 --> 01:50:15.065
D! Congratulations. You're improving!

01:50:15.393 --> 01:50:17.986
I don't understand what you're
saying about twin primes.

01:50:18.076 --> 01:50:19.401
I'm explaining it to you!

01:50:19.537 --> 01:50:20.856
But I still don't understand.

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.975
Don't you know that its
is possible to remove

01:50:23.058 --> 01:50:24.718
an infinite number of
elements from an infinite set

01:50:24.802 --> 01:50:27.378
and still have an infinite
number of elements left over?

01:50:27.462 --> 01:50:29.653
We spent time quite a bit
of time on this already.

01:50:29.737 --> 01:50:32.734
Christ! My wife understood
this on our first date!

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.005
Class dismissed!

01:50:40.421 --> 01:50:44.193
Get out of here! Go! Go!  Go!

01:50:55.957 --> 01:50:57.598
Very enjoyable dinner.

01:50:57.764 --> 01:50:58.611
Good.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.584
-Did you cook it yourself?
-Yes, I did.

01:51:03.383 --> 01:51:05.357
-What a liar.
-Yes, I am.

01:51:08.741 --> 01:51:09.358
What?

01:51:11.423 --> 01:51:15.043
I was thinking, I only smoke
when I'm with you.

01:51:15.997 --> 01:51:17.007
I wonder why?

01:51:24.963 --> 01:51:28.295
I can't thank you enough for
the other day.

01:51:29.415 --> 01:51:30.589
For tonight.

01:51:32.996 --> 01:51:34.641
You're such an inspiration.

01:51:36.399 --> 01:51:37.548
The way you've changed,

01:51:39.769 --> 01:51:43.113
evolved, I guess, is a better word,

01:51:45.254 --> 01:51:50.599
into this beautiful, smart,

01:51:52.928 --> 01:51:53.869
very sexy...

01:52:01.742 --> 01:52:02.999
Mmm.

01:52:04.464 --> 01:52:06.235
I think I must have
loved you all along.

01:52:07.894 --> 01:52:10.983
I just didn't know it.

01:52:13.845 --> 01:52:14.873
What an idiot.

01:52:21.585 --> 01:52:24.907
-Hannah, this is... this is ridiculous.
-Gregory, I really can't talk now.

01:52:25.757 --> 01:52:29.113
She can't not talk to me forever.
I've got to...

01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:33.001
-Gregory, what are you doing?
-I have to explain things.

01:52:33.496 --> 01:52:34.909
I think it's a little late for that
Gregory.

01:52:34.993 --> 01:52:36.218
-Don't you think...
-What?

01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:38.992
I said it's a little
late for that Gregory.

01:52:39.076 --> 01:52:40.652
No, I don't think so.

01:52:41.668 --> 01:52:46.077
What Rose and I have goes far
beyond what normal people...

01:52:46.161 --> 01:52:47.332
What's all that noise?

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:51.229
What are you trying to say, Greg?
Gregory, what is going on?

01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:53.177
-Can you just...
-Gregory...

01:52:53.277 --> 01:52:56.340
Hannah,
Put her on the goddam phone right now!

01:52:56.424 --> 01:52:57.130
She's not here.

01:52:57.895 --> 01:52:58.577
What?

01:52:59.057 --> 01:53:01.597
I might as well tell you,
she's with Alex now.

01:53:02.935 --> 01:53:03.729
Alex?

01:53:04.162 --> 01:53:06.917
She's with him tonight.
He and Claire split up.

01:53:07.446 --> 01:53:09.643
I'm sure you know how much
she's always cared for him.

01:53:10.206 --> 01:53:14.101
So, like I said, I see no point
in your pursuing this any further.

01:53:24.452 --> 01:53:26.540
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

01:53:27.295 --> 01:53:30.843
So,
Mr. Jenkins, which do you like best?

01:53:30.927 --> 01:53:35.530
To be perfectly honest,
I think you're more beautiful now.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.071
Good answer.

01:53:45.192 --> 01:53:47.092
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:53:47.176 --> 01:53:48.044
What... what... what's the matter?

01:53:48.128 --> 01:53:49.235
What did you mean by,

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:52.193
you must have loved me all along,
but just didn't know it?

01:53:52.623 --> 01:53:52.965
I don't...

01:53:53.049 --> 01:53:55.353
Wait... wait... wait...
figure it out, cause I'd like an answer.

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.468
Well, I don't know Rose.
I mean, you were different then.

01:53:58.628 --> 01:53:59.935
You weren't the same as you are now.

01:54:00.108 --> 01:54:01.809
So how could you have loved me then?

01:54:02.044 --> 01:54:04.295
Well, I loved you because of who you
were,

01:54:04.379 --> 01:54:05.823
not because I wanna do you...

01:54:06.041 --> 01:54:07.028
So now you want who I am,

01:54:07.111 --> 01:54:08.423
because I'm not who I was any more?

01:54:13.856 --> 01:54:15.722
Rose, what? What are you doing?

01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:17.401
You know something?

01:54:17.590 --> 01:54:21.329
I have dreamt about this moment
from the first day we met.

01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:24.533
I've played it out a
million times in my mind

01:54:24.807 --> 01:54:27.372
how you'd look,
what you'd say and what you'd think.

01:54:27.996 --> 01:54:29.475
-And guess what?
-What?

01:54:29.942 --> 01:54:30.875
You were better in my
head.

01:54:30.959 --> 01:54:33.136
Oh, Rose, sugar.
Maybe I've had too much to drink.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.593
No. No. It's not you, it's me.

01:54:35.677 --> 01:54:38.320
You see, I don't feel anything.
Isn't that great?

01:54:38.853 --> 01:54:41.212
I never thought about what I would feel,

01:54:41.302 --> 01:54:42.915
I was only thinking about you.

01:54:43.082 --> 01:54:44.631
I only wanted to make you happy.

01:54:44.714 --> 01:54:46.463
I never thought I was
good enough for you.

01:54:46.547 --> 01:54:49.903
But you are good enough for me Rose.
You are! You are!

01:54:49.987 --> 01:54:53.713
I know. I know.
But Alex, you're not good enough for me.

01:54:59.624 --> 01:55:00.490
Okay.

01:55:01.578 --> 01:55:03.698
She's with Alex now, Henry.

01:55:04.284 --> 01:55:05.744
Oh, god!

01:55:06.269 --> 01:55:08.514
I don't know whether it is
my head or my stomach.

01:55:08.723 --> 01:55:11.245
Here, drink this. Come on. Right there.

01:55:11.329 --> 01:55:13.185
I might have Chinese food poisoning.

01:55:13.269 --> 01:55:14.138
Here, give me your coat.

01:55:14.222 --> 01:55:16.257
Maybe my Szechuan chicken they
brought beef

01:55:16.377 --> 01:55:17.641
that they'd give a cat.

01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:19.207
-Cat/
-Uh...

01:55:19.834 --> 01:55:22.336
-I'm so dizzy.
-You feel dizzy?

01:55:22.523 --> 01:55:27.340
I was in my apartment all alone,
and I didn't know what to do.

01:55:27.424 --> 01:55:29.009
Come on. Give me your shoe. That's it.

01:55:29.093 --> 01:55:30.584
I'm sorry, Henry.

01:55:30.667 --> 01:55:33.512
Hey, you'll just stay here tonight.
Come on.

01:55:33.602 --> 01:55:37.058
Henry, I love Rose.

01:55:37.166 --> 01:55:37.840
I love...

01:55:38.943 --> 01:55:40.474
I love the old Rose.

01:55:40.841 --> 01:55:43.195
The one with no make-up
and baggy clothes

01:55:43.279 --> 01:55:44.712
who loves the perfect bite.

01:55:46.212 --> 01:55:50.652
I love her.
It's real. It's not based on passion.

01:55:50.988 --> 01:55:57.529
Although, I feel that.
Or lust, although, I feel that.

01:55:58.925 --> 01:56:02.251
Or even physical attraction.
Because she wasn't...

01:56:03.946 --> 01:56:06.779
although,
I thought she was quite beautiful.

01:56:07.142 --> 01:56:08.860
Her eyes, her mouth.

01:56:09.576 --> 01:56:14.768
The way she held herself,
the way made fun of herself.

01:56:15.683 --> 01:56:19.057
She eats carrots now.
Isn't that tragic?

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:22.358
What am I going to do?

01:56:24.298 --> 01:56:26.582
You know that in the last two years,

01:56:26.666 --> 01:56:29.252
I've been with 11 different women.

01:56:29.336 --> 01:56:31.288
Most of them half my age.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.657
Not one
with a sense of humour I understood.

01:56:34.979 --> 01:56:37.800
Now, I don't date these girls
because they're well read.

01:56:38.133 --> 01:56:40.718
I gave one a copy of A Farewell to Arms,

01:56:40.802 --> 01:56:42.018
and she thought it was a diet book.

01:57:06.314 --> 01:57:09.643
-Can I help you?
-Yes, I want to see Miss Morgan.

01:57:10.474 --> 01:57:12.150
It's kind of late to be visiting people,
don't you think?

01:57:12.234 --> 01:57:13.531
Can you please just ring her apartment?

01:57:13.615 --> 01:57:16.154
I don't believe Miss Morgan would
care to be disturbed at this hour.

01:57:16.238 --> 01:57:17.995
-You don't believe?
-Six o'clock in the morning.

01:57:18.079 --> 01:57:20.083
-I believe...
-I don't care what you believe.

01:57:20.167 --> 01:57:21.275
I know her a
lot better than you do.

01:57:21.359 --> 01:57:22.302
Go home now.

01:57:24.839 --> 01:57:26.173
Rose!

01:57:27.458 --> 01:57:29.014
Rose!

01:57:29.098 --> 01:57:29.481
Hey!

01:57:29.571 --> 01:57:30.487
Do you hear that?

01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:32.537
Get away from this building
or I'm Donna call the police.

01:57:32.621 --> 01:57:33.140
Rose!

01:57:33.224 --> 01:57:34.597
What the hell is going on?

01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:36.224
-Rose!
-Go home.

01:57:36.314 --> 01:57:37.729
Rose!

01:57:37.813 --> 01:57:38.631
Oh, God!

01:57:38.715 --> 01:57:40.832
-It's him, isn't it?
-Gregory!

01:57:40.916 --> 01:57:43.339
-Rose!
-Get away from this building.

01:57:45.101 --> 01:57:47.739
Oh, my God! I can't believe this.

01:57:47.823 --> 01:57:49.324
Rose!

01:57:50.594 --> 01:57:52.872
What is it that he is doing
out there at this hour?

01:57:53.339 --> 01:57:55.433
Mother, I'm Donna go and find out.

01:57:55.789 --> 01:57:59.380
-He's insane.
-I know. Isn't it wonderful?

01:57:59.464 --> 01:58:00.227
What's the problem?

01:58:00.311 --> 01:58:01.178
Rose!

01:58:04.953 --> 01:58:06.621
Get the hell out of here!

01:58:07.355 --> 01:58:09.024
Don't you know people
are trying to sleep?

01:58:09.108 --> 01:58:10.436
Get out, right now!

01:58:12.324 --> 01:58:13.195
You had enough?

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.937
Stop that! Eddie, what are you doing?

01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.613
Don't worry,
Miss Morgan, I'll call the police.

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:20.900
Don't call the police.
This is my husband.

01:58:21.567 --> 01:58:22.860
He doesn't have a key?

01:58:22.944 --> 01:58:24.976
-Don't ask.
-I told you I know her better than you.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.422
-Are you alright?
-Yeah.

01:58:26.588 --> 01:58:29.222
What... what is going on?
What are you doing here?

01:58:29.625 --> 01:58:32.071
-I came to see you.
-Why?

01:58:32.758 --> 01:58:34.598
-Why did you come to see me?
-I... uh...

01:58:35.176 --> 01:58:38.437
In light of our last conversation,
and after speaking with Henry,

01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:40.917
I... I've come to realize... that...

01:58:41.611 --> 01:58:44.131
although you might have significant

01:58:44.214 --> 01:58:46.087
reservations about even considering...

01:58:46.171 --> 01:58:49.589
Gregory! What! I'm ageing here.
What is it you want to say?

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:57.037
God, you're beautiful.

01:59:00.432 --> 01:59:01.431
Thank you.

01:59:02.630 --> 01:59:04.151
Thank you, Gregory.

01:59:10.542 --> 01:59:11.285
What?

01:59:14.692 --> 01:59:20.192
I'm so sorry for the way I
acted and for the things I said.

01:59:21.735 --> 01:59:24.147
-I know that I hurt you.
-It's okay.

01:59:24.351 --> 01:59:26.077
-And...and.. that was the last thing...
-I understand, Gregory.

01:59:26.161 --> 01:59:26.937
in the whole world

01:59:27.034 --> 01:59:29.670
I accept your apology.
-Rose, Rose, please let me finish.

01:59:30.428 --> 01:59:32.147
This is important for me to say.

01:59:36.017 --> 01:59:40.494
That night, that terrible night... I...

01:59:43.425 --> 01:59:47.050
I wanted you so much,
I couldn't see straight.

01:59:51.765 --> 01:59:54.233
I have to make sure you know that, Rose.
It wasn't you.

01:59:54.317 --> 01:59:55.296
Yeah, but I thought that...

01:59:55.792 --> 01:59:57.338
No. It wasn't you, Rose.

01:59:58.061 --> 02:00:00.380
You're a very sexy girl.

02:00:01.885 --> 02:00:03.325
And... and ...

02:00:03.492 --> 02:00:05.600
I know that it's not
fair of me to say that,

02:00:05.683 --> 02:00:07.527
now you're with Alex, but...

02:00:08.541 --> 02:00:09.494
Who said that I...

02:00:10.405 --> 02:00:14.598
-Who said that I was with Alex?
-Your mother.

02:00:15.915 --> 02:00:18.753
My mother? Oh, great.

02:00:21.465 --> 02:00:22.245
No. I couldn't do it.

02:00:23.204 --> 02:00:24.441
I'm not with Alex.

02:00:26.676 --> 02:00:27.787
You're not?

02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:32.200
Well...

02:00:35.664 --> 02:00:36.752
Talk to me.

02:00:39.484 --> 02:00:42.665
Rose, I love you.

02:00:45.763 --> 02:00:48.413
And I want to be married to you.

02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:53.713
Gregory, you are married to me.

02:00:56.038 --> 02:00:59.785
That's right. Yeah, right.

02:01:02.684 --> 02:01:04.451
-God...
-What?

02:01:04.912 --> 02:01:07.020
-I'm getting a little dizzy.
-Oh, god! Why?

02:01:07.104 --> 02:01:09.342
It'll pass. Just hold on.

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.410
Rose, don't ever leave me again.

02:01:11.712 --> 02:01:14.103
I'm not leaving you. I love you.

02:01:15.716 --> 02:01:17.820
I couldn't stand being away from you.
It's killing me.

02:01:17.947 --> 02:01:19.187
Oh, I'm so glad.

02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:22.592
I don't care if you are pretty.
I love you anyway.

02:01:24.357 --> 02:01:26.466
Everything will drop as I get older,

02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:28.184
and I'm gaining weight as we speak.

02:01:30.365 --> 02:01:31.293
That's comforting.

02:05:36.914 --> 02:05:39.984
-Get in, lady.
-No, not you again!

02:05:40.068 --> 02:05:41.183
You noticed?

02:05:42.539 --> 02:05:44.982
I can't believe this.
Your windows are still broke?

02:05:45.065 --> 02:05:47.684
Complain to the cab company. I got
nothing to do with it.
