WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:07.375
The atmosphere is breathable.

00:07.708 --> 00:11.541
Bo-Katan was right.
Mandalore is not cursed.

00:13.041 --> 00:18.041
Bo-Katan Kryze is going off
to bring other Mandalorians in exile to us

00:18.041 --> 00:20.458
so that we may join together once again.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.000
It is time to retake Mandalore.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.125
Have you come back
to join the mercenaries?

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
I've come to reclaim my fleet.

00:38.291 --> 00:41.208
Enough Mandalorian blood
has been spilled by our own hands.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.125
The ruler of Mandalore
must possess the Darksaber.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.625
While exploring Mandalore, I was captured.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.791
And this blade was taken from me.

00:49.791 --> 00:53.291
Bo-Katan rescued me and slayed my captor.

00:54.208 --> 00:57.208
I return this blade to its rightful owner.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.208
<i>I found a derelict New Republic shuttle.</i>

01:04.208 --> 01:05.625
This was an extraction.

01:05.625 --> 01:08.541
<i>Flight times
match the ship transporting Moff Gideon.</i>

01:08.541 --> 01:11.750
I knew it. He never made it to trial.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.458
There appears to be something embedded
in the cabin wall.

01:17.291 --> 01:18.916
It's a fragment of beskar alloy.

01:18.916 --> 01:22.291
Please. You set me up.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.083
Code T-K-2-7-5-5.

03:36.416 --> 03:40.791
<i>Report. And make it quick,
as I am short on time.</i>

03:40.791 --> 03:44.375
Sir, I'm afraid the pirates
have run into trouble on Nevarro.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.666
<i>In your last report,</i>

03:45.666 --> 03:50.500
<i>didn't you suggest that the New Republic
would not be sending support?</i>

03:51.500 --> 03:52.875
It wasn't the New Republic.

03:53.958 --> 03:56.291
Magistrate Karga
was aided by Mandalorians.

03:57.416 --> 03:59.625
<i>Which Mandalorians?</i>

04:00.708 --> 04:03.166
According to the reports
received by the New Republic,

04:04.916 --> 04:07.666
Bo-Katan Kryze lead a squadron
of Mandalorians

04:07.666 --> 04:10.583
alongside Din Djarin and his covert.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.625
<i>This cannot be.
Those two factions are sworn enemies.</i>

04:14.625 --> 04:16.833
Which is why I contacted you with haste.

04:20.750 --> 04:21.875
<i>Continue with your mission.</i>

04:22.541 --> 04:24.875
I shall deal with our Mandalorian friends.

04:52.916 --> 04:55.625
<i>The New Republic is vulnerable,</i>

04:55.625 --> 05:01.166
<i>but we must be cautious
and show no sign of our true strength.</i>

05:01.166 --> 05:04.041
<i>Easy for you to say, Captain.</i>

05:04.041 --> 05:07.500
<i>There's a fortune to be had
plundering the hyperspace lanes.</i>

05:07.500 --> 05:11.416
<i>Commander, your hit-and-run operations
are gaining too much notice.</i>

05:12.000 --> 05:17.458
<i>If we are perceived as anything other than
a group of unorganized remnant warlords,</i>

05:18.541 --> 05:21.583
<i>the New Republic will increase
their efforts to hunt us down.</i>

05:21.583 --> 05:28.291
<i>There are citizens loyal to the Empire
on every planet in this galaxy.</i>

05:29.291 --> 05:33.083
<i>They're already getting sick
of this New Republic</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:35.208
<i>and its rules and regulations.</i>

05:35.208 --> 05:40.166
<i>And if we give them a show of strength,
they will rally behind us.</i>

05:40.166 --> 05:41.458
<i>Yes.</i>

05:41.458 --> 05:44.458
<i>But that strength must not be wasted.</i>

05:44.458 --> 05:47.041
<i>Grand Admiral Thrawn's return</i>

05:47.041 --> 05:50.583
<i>will herald in the reemergence
of our military,</i>

05:51.541 --> 05:55.875
<i>and provide Commandant Hux enough time
to deliver on Project Necromancer.</i>

05:57.916 --> 06:02.916
Captain Pellaeon,
you always speak with much authority,

06:02.916 --> 06:07.958
and yet, I see,  once again,

06:07.958 --> 06:12.333
that Grand Admiral Thrawn
is missing from your delegation.

06:12.333 --> 06:17.833
Any word on when he will be able
to participate in the Shadow Council?

06:20.625 --> 06:27.541
<i>With respect, our one hope for success
relies upon the secrecy of his return.</i>

06:27.541 --> 06:30.916
Captain, secrets are my stock-in-trade.

06:30.916 --> 06:34.333
I hear whispers
from one end of the galaxy to another,

06:34.333 --> 06:37.708
and never a word of Thrawn.

06:38.583 --> 06:43.500
You have spoken of his imminent return.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.916
Perhaps, it's time
we look to new leadership.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.041
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

06:54.291 --> 06:57.041
<i>Project Necromancer is in place for that.</i>

06:57.041 --> 06:59.416
Yes, Commandant.

06:59.416 --> 07:03.458
<i>What has become of Doctor Pershing
and the research you promised us?</i>

07:05.500 --> 07:08.708
Doctor Pershing
was captured by the New Republic.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.041
His research is lost.

07:11.041 --> 07:14.250
For now, at least.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.916
<i>I also hear whispers, Gideon.</i>

07:17.583 --> 07:21.875
<i>You held Pershing and were attempting
your own experiments on Nevarro.</i>

07:21.875 --> 07:26.166
The creation of clones is your obsession,
not mine.

07:27.333 --> 07:31.875
I account for what goes on in my sector,
no more, no less.

07:31.875 --> 07:35.916
The same can be said
of every member of this Council.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.541
<i>- Yes.
- Of course.</i>

07:37.541 --> 07:39.041
<i>- That's right.
- Yes.</i>

07:39.041 --> 07:44.333
And yet, we individually
scrape and claw resources

07:44.333 --> 07:47.625
awaiting the grand plan to take shape,

07:47.625 --> 07:53.041
while you and Pellaeon
amass countless resources

07:53.041 --> 07:55.666
and equipment which should be shared.

07:59.666 --> 08:02.083
<i>Oh, we already received your request.</i>

08:03.666 --> 08:06.041
<i>"Three Praetorian Guards."</i>

08:06.958 --> 08:10.666
<i>Sounds like someone is concerned
about an assassination attempt.</i>

08:10.666 --> 08:13.416
<i>And he thinks I'm being the flashy one.</i>

08:13.416 --> 08:18.083
<i>And reinforcements
for your TIE interceptor squadron.</i>

08:18.958 --> 08:22.250
And... bombers.

08:24.041 --> 08:25.083
<i>Yes, I see.</i>

08:26.875 --> 08:29.708
<i>And what is your security concern?</i>

08:29.708 --> 08:31.083
Mandalorians.

08:31.083 --> 08:32.375
<i>What?</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:37.166
<i>- They continue to be an issue?</i>
- They do.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.625
I am increasingly confident

08:40.333 --> 08:44.583
that they are preparing to retake
their home world of Mandalore.

08:46.291 --> 08:49.250
<i>A resurgent Mandalore
would hamper our efforts.</i>

08:49.250 --> 08:52.500
Which is why
we need to stamp them out now.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.166
<i>Yes.</i>

09:00.333 --> 09:01.958
<i>You'll have your reinforcements.</i>

09:03.208 --> 09:04.458
<i>And your guard.</i>

09:06.416 --> 09:13.083
We shall be rid of the Mandalorians
once and for all.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.916
Long Live the Empire!

09:15.916 --> 09:18.541
<i>Long Live the Empire!</i>

09:58.208 --> 10:00.625
High Magistrate! High Magistrate!

10:00.625 --> 10:03.250
An Imperial shuttle
is advancing over the city.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.416
First, that's a light cruiser.
And second, it's not Imperial.

10:14.416 --> 10:17.333
With apologies, sir.
According to my data, it is.

10:17.333 --> 10:21.833
No, no. It was an Imperial ship.
Look at the markings.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.916
See, those, my friend,
are Mandalorian privateers.

10:26.916 --> 10:30.375
I'll bet you, half that fleet
was captured from the Empire.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.875
So, they're on our side then?

10:32.875 --> 10:34.291
I should hope so.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.833
They're our welcomed guests. Come.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.625
I hope these two groups get along.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.958
They've never met,

11:22.083 --> 11:24.708
and what little they know of each other,
they hate.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.041
They will if they wanna survive.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.458
Take the children inside.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.958
Welcome, fellow Mandalorians.

12:51.833 --> 12:54.250
We invite you to make camp.

12:56.791 --> 12:59.958
Let us prepare a feast for our guests.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.375
Mando!

13:17.416 --> 13:20.208
Welcome back, my friend. Welcome back.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.250
That's quite a fleet you've assembled.

13:24.750 --> 13:28.625
Little welcome gift
to celebrate our new neighbors.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.375
That's all the way from Coruscant,

13:30.375 --> 13:33.958
so you might wanna wait for a smaller
gathering before you open it.

13:33.958 --> 13:37.333
- Thank you.
- That's not the only gift I have for you.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.125
What did you do to IG-11?

14:03.125 --> 14:07.500
No, that's IG-12 now. Do you like him?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.625
Do I like him?

14:09.333 --> 14:11.041
Don't worry. He's safe.

14:11.625 --> 14:12.666
You're sure?

14:12.666 --> 14:16.083
Well, the Anzellans stripped IG
down to his base motor functions.

14:16.083 --> 14:18.208
They removed his memory circuit.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.291
The pilot provides cognition.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.666
IG-12: Yes.

14:30.875 --> 14:35.666
Think of it this way.
It's more like a vehicle. Hmm?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.208
It's safer that way.

14:41.625 --> 14:45.458
Bad baby. No squeezie!

14:45.458 --> 14:47.500
Well, he's too little
to operate this thing.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.750
No, no, no, no. Let's see if he fits.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.583
So what do you think?

15:10.666 --> 15:13.125
They do nice work, I'll give them that.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.000
But, Grogu is too young
to operate heavy machinery.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.541
- Maybe when he's older.
- IG-12: No.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.875
- What do you mean, "No?"
- IG-12: No.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.833
I think he's sayin'
he's old enough to operate it.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.000
IG-12: Yes.

15:28.916 --> 15:30.958
- Mmm-mmm. Get him out of there.
- IG-12: No.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.458
No, at least let him try it out
in my office.

15:33.458 --> 15:37.291
- IG-12: Yes.
- No, this is not a good idea. Come on.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.000
Hey.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.916
Will you look at that?

15:53.125 --> 15:54.500
IG-12: Yes.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.666
"Yes" what?

15:55.666 --> 16:02.125
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

16:03.625 --> 16:07.000
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

16:07.000 --> 16:18.708
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.625
What are you doing?

16:28.625 --> 16:32.458
Stop, Grogu. No.
You have to pay for those.

16:41.791 --> 16:44.208
- No. Hey. Grogu.
- IG-12: Yes. No.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.541
- Give it.
- IG-12: No.

16:45.541 --> 16:47.875
- Grogu, give it ba...

16:53.000 --> 16:54.250
Here.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.291
This isn't working for me.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.125
BO-KATAN: Mandalorians.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.625
It is time to retake our home world.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.666
Even though the planet is not cursed,
there are still dangers.

17:41.708 --> 17:44.583
Dormant species
have been awakened from the bombings.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.750
The remaining magnetic interference

17:46.750 --> 17:50.458
has made it impossible to scan the surface
from above atmosphere.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.250
Which is why I'm proposing
that we leave Nevarro

17:53.250 --> 17:55.916
and move the fleet
into orbit above Mandalore.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.000
We send down a small recon party.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.500
We'll scout the surface,

18:02.500 --> 18:06.750
find out what remains of the Great Forge,
and establish a safe perimeter.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.166
Only then, will we bring down the others.

18:18.166 --> 18:22.041
I need volunteers from both tribes.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.166
I will go.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.166
Grogu as well.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.333
I will go.

18:58.916 --> 18:59.958
I will go.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.666
I will go.

19:03.625 --> 19:04.833
I will go.

19:06.791 --> 19:07.833
I will go.

19:09.541 --> 19:13.666
I will go.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.291
- I will go.
- I will go.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.583
I will go as well.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.708
Scouting party descending to surface.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.000
We'll lose comms shortly.

21:00.541 --> 21:01.875
It's worse than I thought.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.166
I was here when it happened.

21:26.666 --> 21:27.833
They're ready.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.666
Secure infil zone.

22:20.541 --> 22:23.208
Gauntlet, landing zone secure.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.500
Somewhere below
is where our ancient capital once stood.

23:10.125 --> 23:13.791
We'll survey the surface until we find
the Forge and create a safety zone.

23:14.583 --> 23:17.750
Only then
will we begin to bring down the settlers.

23:18.916 --> 23:20.916
We start scouting in that direction.

23:23.708 --> 23:24.708
Form up.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.791
There, on the horizon.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.000
- BO-KATAN: Nite Owls.
Flanking left.

24:41.416 --> 24:42.583
Do you have food?

24:48.583 --> 24:49.625
BO-KATAN: We do.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.708
You wear the crest of the Nite Owls?

24:57.708 --> 24:58.958
BO-KATAN: I should hope so.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.291
They're Mandalorians.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.958
Is that the voice of Lady Bo-Katan Kryze?

25:11.833 --> 25:13.041
It is.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.041
We knew you would not forsake us,
Lady Bo-Katan.

25:37.125 --> 25:41.666
We have failed you,
but our blasters remain in your service.

25:48.291 --> 25:51.083
They intercepted
any ships they saw leaving.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.625
They took no prisoners.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.958
They bombed every surface twice over.

25:57.916 --> 26:02.666
They punished us
as a warning to the whole galaxy

26:02.666 --> 26:04.791
because we refused to surrender.

26:11.083 --> 26:12.458
That's not true.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.583
I did surrender.

26:30.708 --> 26:34.125
After our forces were annihilated
in the Night of a Thousand Tears

26:34.125 --> 26:37.291
and defeat was imminent,

26:39.250 --> 26:40.791
I met with Moff Gideon.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.750
The ISB had reached out to me
to negotiate a cease-fire.

26:47.166 --> 26:50.333
In exchange for submitting
to the Empire and disarming,

26:51.291 --> 26:54.958
all remaining cities and Mandalorian lives
were to be spared.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.958
That is how Moff Gideon
came to possess the Darksaber.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.208
I didn't trust him,

27:06.208 --> 27:09.458
but it was the only chance I had
to save our people.

27:15.041 --> 27:16.166
And then he betrayed me

27:16.166 --> 27:19.416
and we were helpless
to resist the Purge of Mandalore.

27:26.833 --> 27:29.000
How did these others survive?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.125
We were hidden
on the moon of Concordia.

27:32.958 --> 27:34.291
Are you Death Watch?

27:35.041 --> 27:37.958
Death Watch exists no longer.

27:37.958 --> 27:41.083
It shattered into many warring factions.

27:42.166 --> 27:44.875
Our people have suffered time and again.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.500
From division and squabbling factions.

27:51.166 --> 27:56.916
Mandalore has always been too powerful
for any enemy to defeat.

28:00.166 --> 28:04.458
It is always
our own division that destroys us.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.250
I had no idea.

28:27.541 --> 28:30.666
We were taught that everyone
but us had forsaken the Way.

28:31.833 --> 28:34.125
That you were selfish and uncaring.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.083
Now I understand.

28:39.541 --> 28:41.041
You were right.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.291
I was selfish.

28:45.208 --> 28:46.708
And this is what it wrought.

28:52.458 --> 28:53.833
We'll rebuild it.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.916
Isn't that our history?

28:56.833 --> 29:00.083
For thousands of years,
we have been on the verge of extinction,

29:00.083 --> 29:03.458
and for thousands of years,
we have survived.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.458
I don't know
if I can keep everyone together.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.625
There's too much animosity.

29:13.958 --> 29:18.083
And this blade
is all I have to unify our people.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.833
I only know of this weapon
what you taught me.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.375
To be honest,
it means nothing to me or my people.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.625
Nor does station or bloodline.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.916
What means more to me is honor.

29:33.333 --> 29:36.208
And loyalty. And character.

29:37.333 --> 29:40.541
These are the reasons
I serve you, Lady Kryze.

29:41.666 --> 29:43.375
Your song is not yet written.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.583
I will serve you until it is.

30:29.791 --> 30:32.458
We'll rest tonight
and continue at first light.

30:32.458 --> 30:35.083
These here are too weak to continue.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.666
We must return to the Gauntlet

30:37.666 --> 30:40.333
and I will ferry them back to the fleet
in the morning.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.375
Agreed.

30:43.875 --> 30:44.916
Captain?

30:47.041 --> 30:48.416
Those of you who are well enough

30:48.416 --> 30:50.541
can join us in the search
for the Great Forge.

30:50.541 --> 30:52.125
We can do better than that.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.041
We can bring you there.

31:01.958 --> 31:05.666
Onward, Mandalorians! To the Forge!

32:19.708 --> 32:21.666
You can't move an Enforcer like that.

32:22.333 --> 32:25.333
It's a flank jump.
And you're about to submit.

32:28.416 --> 32:30.666
But only the Wing Guard can flank jump.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.958
The Enforcer moves like a Wing Guard
when it's flanking.

32:36.958 --> 32:39.500
These primitives
make up their own rules for everything.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.500
Seriously?

32:51.541 --> 32:53.333
Submit or fight.

32:59.791 --> 33:00.875
Can you believe this?

33:17.250 --> 33:18.666
Should I step in?

33:18.666 --> 33:20.541
Neither side can step in.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.666
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

33:58.750 --> 34:04.458
- IG-12: No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.833
You taught your apprentice well.

34:22.541 --> 34:24.083
He didn't learn that from me.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.000
Come in, Fleet Command.

34:46.833 --> 34:47.958
<i>We read you.</i>

34:47.958 --> 34:52.250
Prepare to receive rescued survivors
in need of medical attention.

34:52.250 --> 34:53.458
Copy, Gauntlet.

35:16.583 --> 35:20.208
There, on the starboard bow!

36:00.166 --> 36:01.750
Abandon ship!

36:03.000 --> 36:04.458
Let's go!

36:28.208 --> 36:30.416
This way! This way!

36:33.541 --> 36:34.833
Hurry up! Faster!

36:38.625 --> 36:39.625
You good?

36:42.250 --> 36:44.375
We're not far.
We need to go further down.

36:44.375 --> 36:45.791
Go, go, go.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.000
Go! Go, go!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.250
Where are we?

37:39.625 --> 37:41.500
This is what's left of the Great Forge.

37:43.916 --> 37:46.083
This was once
the heart of our civilization.

37:48.416 --> 37:51.208
But the fires have been extinguished
since the bombings.

37:52.208 --> 37:53.708
You lived here?

37:53.708 --> 37:55.125
We all did.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.291
We never left.

37:57.125 --> 38:00.000
Survived by migrating
along the surface until the war ended.

38:00.791 --> 38:03.083
Some tried to explore below,
but none survived.

38:07.666 --> 38:08.833
Jet packs?

38:11.166 --> 38:12.208
More survivors?

38:15.916 --> 38:17.666
Those aren't Mandalorians.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.375
They're Imperials!
Take cover.

38:30.875 --> 38:32.708
They're wearing beskar armor!

38:38.375 --> 38:40.791
We're pinned down. We need backup.

38:40.791 --> 38:43.291
I can make a run for the fleet
and get us reinforcements.

38:43.291 --> 38:44.708
No, it's too far.

38:44.708 --> 38:47.500
I can make it. It's our only shot
at taking the planet back.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.833
There's a split in the ceiling there.

38:51.291 --> 38:52.708
I'll lay down cover.

39:58.708 --> 39:59.916
They're retreating!

40:02.083 --> 40:03.708
BO-KATAN: Advance.

40:03.708 --> 40:06.416
For Mandalore!

40:06.416 --> 40:08.500
Okay, kid. You've gotta keep up.

40:57.125 --> 40:58.375
BO-KATAN: What is this place?

41:04.083 --> 41:05.375
It's an ambush.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.666
Disarm him.

42:00.958 --> 42:03.750
Thank you for gathering
the Mandalorians into one place.

42:05.416 --> 42:09.750
You were a talented people,
but your time has passed.

42:09.750 --> 42:15.750
However, as you can see,
Mandalore will live on in me.

42:16.958 --> 42:20.000
Thanks to your planet's rich resources,

42:20.000 --> 42:24.083
I have created
the next generation Dark Trooper suit

42:24.083 --> 42:27.500
forged from beskar alloy.

42:30.583 --> 42:36.000
And the most impressive improvement
is that it has me in it.

42:37.250 --> 42:40.083
You see,
every society has something to offer.

42:40.083 --> 42:42.666
The cloners. The Jedi.

42:44.166 --> 42:46.250
And even the Mandalorians.

42:47.125 --> 42:49.791
By aggregating the best of each,

42:49.791 --> 42:54.708
I will create an army
that will bring order to the galaxy.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.416
Why don't we take your fleet off the board

42:59.208 --> 43:01.208
while we still have
the element of surprise.

43:01.208 --> 43:03.666
Activate the interceptors and bombers.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.750
BO-KATAN: No!

43:18.500 --> 43:23.333
In but a few moments,
the Purge of Mandalore will be complete.

43:28.416 --> 43:31.083
Take him to the debriefing room.

43:36.208 --> 43:38.583
BO-KATAN: I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

43:41.416 --> 43:42.500
Bo-Katan.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.458
We have to stop meeting like this.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.666
BO-KATAN: I'll make sure of it.

43:49.166 --> 43:50.958
Let's skip the pleasantries, shall we?

43:51.875 --> 43:53.875
I believe this is the part

43:53.875 --> 43:56.875
where you return
the Darksaber to its rightful owner.

44:01.291 --> 44:04.458
Now, surrender the Darksaber,

44:04.458 --> 44:06.958
and tell these people
that this planet is mine.

44:10.166 --> 44:11.333
This is the Way.

44:18.791 --> 44:20.125
Open the blast doors.

44:21.333 --> 44:22.416
Kill them.

44:35.916 --> 44:38.458
- BO-KATAN: Move out!
Move out!

44:38.458 --> 44:41.541
Fall back! I'll cover the rear!

44:41.541 --> 44:44.125
Go, go, go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

45:01.666 --> 45:03.000
BO-KATAN: We're clear. Fall back.

45:07.458 --> 45:10.166
Come on. We're not leaving you behind.

45:12.916 --> 45:15.000
Go. There are too many.

45:15.958 --> 45:17.125
BO-KATAN: No!

45:18.208 --> 45:19.583
This is the Way.
