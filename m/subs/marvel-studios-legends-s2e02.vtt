00:28.528 --> 00:30.071
BURCH: You can go.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.323
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.910
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

00:35.994 --> 00:37.579
if you just give me that component.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.832
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here is my heart.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.792
So, now what?

00:43.626 --> 00:44.627
You'll see.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.713
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

00:53.595 --> 00:55.889
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, Sonny.

The Yellowjacket!

01:11.237 --> 01:13.114
<i>-and let me finish this once and for all.</i>
-HANK:<i> No.</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:14.949
I have Cross' complete trust.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.118
-It's too dangerous.
-We don't have a choice.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.080
-I think I found a guy.
-Who?

01:21.039 --> 01:23.792
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.794
You should be able to shrink and grow...

01:25.877 --> 01:27.003
-on a dime.

-Useless.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.385
-You have to know how to punch.
-I was in prison for three years.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.638
-I know how to punch.
-Show me. Terrible.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.306
You wanna show me how to punch?

01:38.389 --> 01:39.766
Show me...

01:40.433 --> 01:42.143
That's how you punch.

Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.065
By "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.733
HANK:<i> We lost her in a plane crash.</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:50.944
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.988
Could you please stop telling me that lie?
We're working, here.

HOPE:<i> I was against using him when we</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:04.541
I'm wearing the suit.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.000
Absolutely not!

02:06.084 --> 02:09.003
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.713
<i>I know this mission better than anybody.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:13.258
We need you close to Cross,
or this mission cannot work.

02:17.887 --> 02:18.888
Hope!

02:22.016 --> 02:23.726
Even now, he still wants to shut me out.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.353
He doesn't wanna shut you out.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.646
Then why are you here?

02:26.729 --> 02:27.856
I'm expendable.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.024
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.527
-(HANK GROANS)
-Dad!

02:32.610 --> 02:35.155
Go get that suit.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.919
-When did this happen?
-Nothing's happening.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.881
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.507
Well, if that's the case...

02:54.591 --> 02:55.758
shoot me again.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.803
There's something I want to show you.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.307
HANK: This is an advanced prototype...

03:02.390 --> 03:04.976
that your mother and I worked on together.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.644
She never got to use it.

03:06.728 --> 03:11.149
But now I realize that
we were working on it for you.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.526
It's about damn time.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.279
You gave her wings?

03:18.156 --> 03:21.701
I think it's possible
to bring your mother back.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.789
The only chance we got is if the two
of you are out here protecting the tunnel.

-Mom.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.191
So, Cassie, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

03:53.274 --> 03:55.109
I wanna help people, like my dad.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.862
-Really?
-I wanted to be his partner.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.489
But he said he wants you.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.159
I know what I must do.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.665
<i>Shred this universe down to its last atom.</i>
