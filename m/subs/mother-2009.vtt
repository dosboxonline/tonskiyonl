WEBVTT

03:27.081 --> 03:37.007
MOTHER

04:14.170 --> 04:15.045
At ease!

04:15.588 --> 04:16.588
Salute!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.054
Do-joon!

04:24.180 --> 04:26.765
Hey, Benz! You asshole!

04:26.891 --> 04:29.893
Do-joon, are you okay?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.353
Oh no, blood!

04:31.521 --> 04:33.272
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!

04:33.356 --> 04:36.775
Shit, mom, get back in the store!

04:37.193 --> 04:39.778
You're bleeding!

04:43.992 --> 04:45.492
He's bleeding!

04:45.785 --> 04:49.579
I knew it!
This is your own blood!

04:49.664 --> 04:52.791
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!

04:53.251 --> 04:54.167
Did they go there?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.335
You idiot,

04:55.503 --> 04:58.171
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?

04:59.173 --> 05:01.174
Is this hit-and-run?

05:01.259 --> 05:04.803
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone

05:04.887 --> 05:06.596
deserve to have
their faces slammed.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.098
Look!

05:08.182 --> 05:11.810
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.272
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...

05:16.524 --> 05:19.484
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.487
Ah, a black Benz, black...

05:22.572 --> 05:25.782
How could you mix up...

05:25.867 --> 05:27.367
It could happen.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.245
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.

05:30.371 --> 05:34.791
Oh, there it is!

05:49.891 --> 05:51.266
That must've hurt.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.981
Come on, stupid.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.458
Enough, it's not a surgery.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.378
What are you, a doctor?

06:19.796 --> 06:23.298
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.427
This is driving me crazy.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.055
Where the heck has he gone?

06:31.432 --> 06:33.600
It's a golf course.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.062
Right. It's a golf course.

06:37.688 --> 06:41.191
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?

06:41.275 --> 06:42.442
Yay!

06:44.904 --> 06:48.281
Twelve ofthem!

06:51.619 --> 06:53.703
What does she see in you anyway?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.455
Your mom?

06:57.291 --> 06:59.167
Right, mom...

06:59.794 --> 07:01.878
The car... Vroom.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.171
Crash!

07:03.798 --> 07:05.090
My blood!

07:06.092 --> 07:09.886
This is revenge.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.806
Right, we're here for revenge.

07:15.893 --> 07:16.893
Anyway,

07:17.687 --> 07:19.604
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.606
They should have passed by now.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.820
Wow, look!

07:29.115 --> 07:30.991
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?

07:37.373 --> 07:38.874
I'll give it to a girl.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.711
You got someone to give it to?

07:44.088 --> 07:45.255
Uh... Yeah.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.090
You ever slept with a woman?

07:50.094 --> 07:52.262
Idiot...

07:52.388 --> 07:54.473
You with your pretty face.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.183
I slept with a woman.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.560
What woman?

07:59.812 --> 08:00.896
Mom.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.984
Where the fuck are they...

08:28.716 --> 08:29.466
Come on!

08:29.550 --> 08:30.800
They're here!

08:32.720 --> 08:35.889
Revenge! Revenge!

09:01.582 --> 09:02.999
What's that idiot doing?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.711
What's with him?

09:06.796 --> 09:09.214
Fucking assholes!

09:10.466 --> 09:13.468
Stop the car! You!

09:14.053 --> 09:15.637
What are you doing?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.264
Who do you think you are?
What is this?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.979
You shitheads!

09:24.063 --> 09:28.817
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!

09:28.901 --> 09:30.569
Who was driving? You?

09:38.077 --> 09:38.994
What is this?

09:39.078 --> 09:40.287
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.913
Were you the one driving?

10:01.809 --> 10:02.892
Excuse me.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.979
This person is
too important to be here...

10:08.566 --> 10:12.652
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.281
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves

10:16.407 --> 10:19.075
being involved in a hit-and-run...

10:19.160 --> 10:21.786
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.289
They're just local kids.

10:26.167 --> 10:30.378
So we're going to settle, okay?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.383
The hit-and-run and the assault

10:35.676 --> 10:37.469
cancel each other out.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.388
Do-joon
The verbal threats don't factor in.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.475
Dean Kwon, the car...

10:43.559 --> 10:47.395
They smashed my rearview mirror
in the parking lot.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.481
A Mercedes Benz 280.

10:55.279 --> 11:00.158
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?

11:01.077 --> 11:03.912
That'll cost a lot.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.580
You bet.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.001
Damn... Why did I do that?

11:10.086 --> 11:14.673
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?

11:17.468 --> 11:18.468
Retard?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.681
What are you doing?

11:24.475 --> 11:28.478
Let go! Let me go!

11:28.562 --> 11:29.729
That bastard,
who does he think he is?

11:29.897 --> 11:30.980
Sit down, Mister.

11:34.902 --> 11:38.571
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...

11:38.656 --> 11:39.906
A lot.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.201
$1500? $2000?

11:45.287 --> 11:47.080
Ah, here she comes...

11:47.498 --> 11:48.748
Good afternoon, sir.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.264
Eat up.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.642
Eat.

12:07.768 --> 12:13.898
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.654
Fuck...

12:20.406 --> 12:22.282
I can feed myself.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.668
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.754
It's good for your virility.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.548
Really? My virility?

12:39.091 --> 12:41.676
Why are you
so concerned about that?

12:42.678 --> 12:43.678
Women.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.765
Are you seeing someone?

12:49.393 --> 12:52.562
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.855
Sleep with her?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.273
Who is it?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.860
Gonna sleep with a woman.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.991
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?

13:05.075 --> 13:07.368
That expensive mirror?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.580
Smash! With my foot.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.166
It was revenge!

13:13.292 --> 13:14.751
Good boy.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.837
But I've got no money.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.591
Where will I dig that up?

13:21.675 --> 13:24.177
Whose yard will I dig it up in?

13:24.303 --> 13:27.472
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.848
Jin-tae!

13:29.016 --> 13:32.852
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.022
He's from bad seed.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.984
Okay.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.738
Where are you going?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.198
To meet Jin-tae.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.202
You should finish dinner.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.580
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.670
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.797
Come home early!

14:44.216 --> 14:45.383
Don't be late.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.961
It doesn't hurt, right?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.964
No, it's fine.

15:25.966 --> 15:30.303
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.597
So can you lend me some money?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.600
How much?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.852
It's really urgent.

15:37.978 --> 15:41.105
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.858
- Medicine?
- Yes!

15:43.984 --> 15:45.985
To make you pregnant,

15:46.111 --> 15:48.196
guaranteed effective.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.989
Is there such a thing?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.283
It really works.

15:52.368 --> 15:56.371
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.749
Your son will be
just as good-looking.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.584
Do-joon...

16:02.044 --> 16:04.671
His eyes are a work of art.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.214
Like a deer's.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.758
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.219
They're just like yours.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.971
They're beautiful.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.766
Anyway,

16:16.892 --> 16:20.687
you're looking sexier these days...

16:21.063 --> 16:23.314
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.024
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?

16:27.861 --> 16:28.861
He's not?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.863
He should be here by now.

16:31.365 --> 16:35.785
You've been saying that for hours.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.496
Don't mess with me.

16:38.580 --> 16:43.501
I just came back
from the police station.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.670
Have some respect.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.806
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!

17:00.060 --> 17:04.063
Go to bed, mom!

17:05.065 --> 17:09.777
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.583
Good shot!

17:33.302 --> 17:34.552
Hey, wake up.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.305
Wake up!

17:38.849 --> 17:41.476
Do something about him.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.491
Did you have a nice sleep?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.786
Wipe the spit off your face.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.998
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.

18:04.083 --> 18:08.586
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!

18:08.670 --> 18:09.754
This is driving me crazy.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.464
Do-joon!

18:11.590 --> 18:13.466
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.886
- Mina!
- How have you been?

18:17.304 --> 18:21.474
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.767
Really?

18:22.893 --> 18:27.605
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.482
Okay, I'm going.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.610
Shut up
and go do your homework.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.154
That skirt is pretty.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.782
You! Turn around!

18:38.367 --> 18:39.659
Her legs are prettier.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.786
Get your eyes off her!

18:41.870 --> 18:43.788
Get out of here!

18:43.872 --> 18:44.956
BAR MANHATTAN

18:46.375 --> 18:48.960
Please fuck off, okay?

18:49.044 --> 18:50.294
Wait...

18:51.380 --> 18:53.965
To pay for the drinks...

18:55.592 --> 18:56.884
Expensive ones...

19:26.790 --> 19:32.795
Hey!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.507
Where are you going?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.804
How about you and me...

19:42.097 --> 19:43.264
have a drink?

19:45.142 --> 19:47.685
With a guy... Don't want to?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.983
You don't like guys?

21:20.279 --> 21:24.782
So late...

22:05.866 --> 22:09.994
What was her name, Ah-jung?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.997
It's Moon Ah-Jung.

22:13.081 --> 22:16.167
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.170
You called her house?
She has guardians?

22:19.254 --> 22:22.381
There's a grandmother,

22:22.883 --> 22:24.800
but she's a real loon.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.095
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,

22:28.180 --> 22:29.513
making a scene.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.432
So the kid is the guardian.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.852
She takes care of her grandma.

22:38.607 --> 22:43.694
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?

22:47.282 --> 22:50.284
It's the first since I came here.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.704
Has it been that long?

22:53.789 --> 22:54.872
Yep.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.297
The crime scene seems intact.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.673
It is.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.258
Quite a picture, huh?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.886
Cops these days...

23:08.970 --> 23:11.347
You know, CSI and all that on TV.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.599
They all watch it.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.060
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.270
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.774
So things must be
pretty mucked up.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.692
I suppose.

23:24.361 --> 23:28.072
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.908
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...

23:44.256 --> 23:45.172
What's with this?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.091
Didn't this come in last week?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.179
God, that smell...

23:52.264 --> 23:54.181
Yeah, well...

23:54.266 --> 23:56.267
This smells like a rotting corpse.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.602
My god!

23:58.687 --> 24:00.896
Look at this if you're not blind.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.274
And the appearance...

24:04.359 --> 24:07.278
People are going to think
they're from China.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.280
Ma'am, these are from China.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.489
Hey!

24:10.907 --> 24:13.701
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.454
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.873
Don't tell me...

24:19.249 --> 24:21.375
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?

24:23.545 --> 24:26.380
No, no way!

24:26.465 --> 24:27.882
My husband is a public official.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.175
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?

24:29.259 --> 24:31.260
Sure, I know.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.970
He'll be promoted soon,

24:33.096 --> 24:35.723
so let's not cause any trouble.

24:36.266 --> 24:40.978
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?

24:41.396 --> 24:43.814
You think only you will
get in trouble?

24:43.899 --> 24:46.442
It will ruin my family completely.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.694
Listen when someone's
talking to you.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.862
Mom!

24:51.531 --> 24:59.455
Do-joon! Do-joon!

25:02.792 --> 25:03.792
Mom!

25:04.085 --> 25:06.378
Get down!

25:07.297 --> 25:08.464
Oh geez...

25:08.548 --> 25:11.467
She's a good runner.

25:53.885 --> 25:57.471
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.891
You have the right to remain silent

26:01.184 --> 26:04.812
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.481
There she is.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.983
Not that she can
afford to do anything.

26:10.485 --> 26:13.195
Can't you drive, idiot?

26:14.197 --> 26:15.906
Are you hurt anywhere?

26:15.991 --> 26:18.200
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.661
Turn your head around.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.957
Why is he...

26:30.463 --> 26:31.964
- A dog?
- Dog...

26:32.090 --> 26:34.091
- A wolf?
- Dog...

26:35.635 --> 26:36.969
It's usually hot here.

26:37.095 --> 26:40.097
We're all guys here,
so take that off.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.890
Your pants too, okay?

26:41.975 --> 26:44.268
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.

26:45.895 --> 26:49.815
This isn't police torture.

26:49.899 --> 26:53.110
I'm taking my pants offtoo.
It feels good.

26:55.280 --> 27:00.159
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?

27:00.285 --> 27:03.370
- You have, right?
- No.

27:03.788 --> 27:07.374
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.085
Bite it!

27:13.173 --> 27:14.673
Come here and bite it.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.888
That's right, turn around.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.181
The sin always turns around.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.893
Stand straight. Close your eyes.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.687
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!

27:30.690 --> 27:31.649
Did you see it?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.150
I bet not.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.738
This is power of Sepaktakraw.

27:37.906 --> 27:41.450
It's one ofthe basic moves.

27:43.662 --> 27:48.165
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,

27:48.291 --> 27:51.293
I'll kill you right here.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.754
I'll be watching you.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.756
Do-joon,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.175
what did you do last night?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.593
Hey, spit out the apple.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.013
What did you do?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.640
I had a drink...

28:04.724 --> 28:05.974
Where?

28:06.059 --> 28:09.728
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?

28:11.064 --> 28:12.481
I slept at home.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.066
You slept, of course.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.903
But before that, I mean...

28:17.987 --> 28:20.739
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan

28:20.907 --> 28:24.201
on your way home,
what did you do?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.578
The lady at Manhattan said

28:26.663 --> 28:29.498
you were like a dog in heat.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.208
Her daughter, what's her name?

28:31.292 --> 28:34.086
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.672
You were hitting on her?

28:37.382 --> 28:39.967
Well, I...

28:40.093 --> 28:41.885
Answer clearly!

28:41.970 --> 28:44.471
I slept at home. With mom.

28:46.474 --> 28:50.978
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?

28:56.776 --> 28:58.986
You don't have to answer.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.905
Anyway,
you say you don't remember

29:02.198 --> 29:05.576
but everyone remembers you.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.662
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.458
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.376
Heading towards
the scene ofthe murder.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.754
Isn't that right?

29:19.549 --> 29:21.467
I don't remember...

29:21.551 --> 29:24.011
You wanna
die here right now, punk?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.013
We've got plenty of apples.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.474
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.559
You know,

29:31.269 --> 29:33.395
we also found something

29:34.689 --> 29:38.025
next to the body.

29:41.196 --> 29:44.656
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?

29:44.741 --> 29:47.576
With your name written right on it.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.662
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,

29:51.289 --> 29:53.081
Just between us...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.083
Why did you do it?

29:56.169 --> 29:59.004
On personal level,
I'm really curious.

30:00.465 --> 30:05.385
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?

30:11.017 --> 30:14.853
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.

30:15.188 --> 30:18.190
Maybe we can
do something for you.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.652
He's asking this
for your own benefit.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.363
Do-joon.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.366
To be honest,

30:27.867 --> 30:30.869
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.372
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.667
You've never been a bad kid.

30:36.751 --> 30:39.211
I can be bad.

30:41.756 --> 30:45.509
Jesus...

30:46.511 --> 30:51.265
Right, anyone can commit murder.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.767
It's not like you need a license.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.564
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,

31:01.109 --> 31:03.569
but you killed her, right?

31:06.573 --> 31:09.575
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.494
He confessed.

31:13.204 --> 31:18.125
Anyway, this document contains
all the details ofthe case, see?

31:18.209 --> 31:21.128
Check it over.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.090
But you can read, right?

31:25.174 --> 31:26.758
Want me to read it for you?

31:26.843 --> 31:27.676
I can read.

31:27.760 --> 31:33.557
Sure, anyway, don'tjust sign it
without reading it.

31:33.683 --> 31:36.268
Check the contents, and sign.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.936
Read it well.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.857
Why did you do it!

31:42.692 --> 31:44.484
How could you do that?

31:45.778 --> 31:47.195
They hit you?

31:47.864 --> 31:51.700
The cops beat you, didn't they?

31:54.704 --> 31:58.290
Where did they hit you?

31:58.458 --> 31:59.750
An apple...

32:00.960 --> 32:03.837
Apple

32:14.098 --> 32:15.390
Do-joon,

32:16.392 --> 32:18.852
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.689
Focus. Take a deep breath.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.198
Do-joon...

32:31.658 --> 32:34.034
Everyone says I killed her.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.869
Breathe like me.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.871
And so...

32:38.748 --> 32:41.375
the sin turns around
a few times

32:42.377 --> 32:44.211
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?

32:44.295 --> 32:47.381
Did you really sign
that confession?

32:49.592 --> 32:51.969
Why? Why? Why?

32:52.053 --> 32:55.681
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.225
If I killed her, I should admit it.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.476
Did you kill her?

32:59.602 --> 33:01.895
Are you crazy? Of course not.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.689
Then why did you sign it, idiot!

33:03.773 --> 33:05.941
Don't call your son an idiot!

33:24.585 --> 33:25.669
Je-mun,

33:25.795 --> 33:28.296
How could you
of all people do this to him?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.589
You know him,

33:29.674 --> 33:32.676
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.850
A water bug...

33:43.271 --> 33:44.771
Wipe off your face first.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.496
Je-mun,

34:02.415 --> 34:06.877
here's some ofthe camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.

34:06.961 --> 34:11.840
You said it helped you think clearly.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.842
- Take it.
- Listen.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.763
From early morning,

34:17.847 --> 34:19.556
I'm going to be up dealing

34:19.681 --> 34:21.683
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.685
And... that crazy kid JP ran away

34:23.770 --> 34:26.313
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.565
I gotta go there and then...

34:29.692 --> 34:33.695
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...

34:33.780 --> 34:36.406
What I mean is...

34:42.789 --> 34:44.081
regarding Do-joon,

34:45.750 --> 34:50.128
his case is closed, okay?

34:53.591 --> 34:55.382
Do you understand?

34:59.305 --> 35:02.682
It's finished, 100%.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.779
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.784
I left early, you ass.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.666
Excuse me, people. Step aside.

35:40.179 --> 35:43.056
What the hell are you doing?

35:43.599 --> 35:45.976
What's inside this thing anyway?

35:59.782 --> 36:02.868
Put it down there.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.495
Turn it over.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.789
What in god's name
are you doing?

36:11.502 --> 36:13.420
Are you kidding me?

36:13.504 --> 36:15.964
Turn the damn thing over.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.093
Mister, don't touch it!

36:20.428 --> 36:23.096
Actually I'm not a relative,

36:23.181 --> 36:24.097
but I'm close to them.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.390
Sir!

36:27.768 --> 36:31.062
Ifthere's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.983
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?

36:35.067 --> 36:37.569
The golf ball has
already been reported.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.155
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?

36:42.700 --> 36:45.869
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.414
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.083
It's my only son.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.079
Is she crazy?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.958
Why is that woman here?

37:33.668 --> 37:35.043
Who?

37:35.503 --> 37:36.878
Yoon Do-joon's mother...

37:40.341 --> 37:41.591
No...

37:42.885 --> 37:44.678
How the hell could you?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.346
Are you out of your mind?

37:47.056 --> 37:48.682
I'm just...

37:48.766 --> 37:53.687
As a member ofthis community
I wanted to pay my respects.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.775
You came to apologize?
For your son?

37:58.901 --> 38:00.527
Does that make sense?

38:06.158 --> 38:11.329
Actually, my son didn't do it.

38:14.875 --> 38:18.795
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,

38:18.879 --> 38:21.506
you of all people
must understand!

38:21.966 --> 38:23.883
It wasn't my son!

38:27.513 --> 38:29.264
She's completely insane!

38:29.348 --> 38:30.515
Hey bitch!

38:30.599 --> 38:32.600
How could you
bring your ugly face here?

38:32.685 --> 38:33.977
Throw some salt at her!

38:34.103 --> 38:36.604
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.

38:36.689 --> 38:37.605
Stop it!

38:37.690 --> 38:38.773
What do you mean he's innocent?

38:38.858 --> 38:40.692
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!

38:40.776 --> 38:42.777
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!

38:42.862 --> 38:43.987
Bring her back to us!

38:44.071 --> 38:45.864
Let's talk civilly!

38:48.492 --> 38:51.369
Bring Ah-jung back to life!

38:51.704 --> 38:54.372
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!

38:56.876 --> 38:59.085
Let go!

38:59.170 --> 39:00.378
What's there to discuss?

39:00.504 --> 39:04.007
How could she dare?

39:05.384 --> 39:07.177
Shut up you fuckers!

39:07.261 --> 39:10.013
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.267
How could you
raise such a rotten son?

39:14.352 --> 39:15.977
That goddamn son of a bitch!

39:16.854 --> 39:21.441
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!

39:22.360 --> 39:24.986
Rip that bitch's tongue out!

39:25.071 --> 39:26.863
Don't hate him!

39:26.989 --> 39:28.156
I won't...

40:26.340 --> 40:28.258
This place has the best seafood.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.802
You know everything, don't you?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.595
It's true.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.598
Shall we sit down here?

40:36.350 --> 40:38.601
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.811
Don't run!

40:40.479 --> 40:43.982
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.818
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.611
I save time that way.

40:49.905 --> 40:53.950
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.952
Say hello to him.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.706
Do-joon,

40:59.790 --> 41:02.459
Tuck your shirt in.

41:04.170 --> 41:07.172
That side, too.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.716
It looks better this way.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.176
Does it?

41:12.887 --> 41:16.181
Are you getting
along well enough here?

41:16.265 --> 41:17.390
Yes,

41:17.475 --> 41:19.976
the food is good.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.729
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.

41:23.397 --> 41:26.691
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.068
Do-joon!

41:29.153 --> 41:34.157
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.

41:34.283 --> 41:39.996
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.789
You understand?

41:41.874 --> 41:43.708
What you saw, what you heard,

41:43.792 --> 41:47.378
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.

41:47.713 --> 41:51.174
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.385
That's your only task in here.

41:56.388 --> 41:57.555
Isn't that right?

41:58.891 --> 41:59.891
Right.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.895
Yes, do this.

42:04.688 --> 42:08.274
Is this some kind of exercise?

42:08.359 --> 42:12.695
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.281
From childhood,
whenever he does this

42:15.366 --> 42:16.991
it helped him remember.

42:17.076 --> 42:19.202
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.

42:19.286 --> 42:21.579
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...

42:21.705 --> 42:23.289
acupressure.

42:25.084 --> 42:27.794
Oh, I remember!

42:28.379 --> 42:29.462
What?

42:31.465 --> 42:32.799
I didn't do it.

42:33.801 --> 42:34.801
It wasn't me!

42:34.885 --> 42:37.971
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.472
No,

42:40.641 --> 42:42.475
not that.

42:43.352 --> 42:46.563
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!

42:48.899 --> 42:52.485
On the Benz... Jin-tae...

42:52.987 --> 42:56.990
It was Jin-tae who did it.

42:57.825 --> 43:01.828
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!

43:03.831 --> 43:04.872
Sir.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.541
Let me explain.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.960
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.

43:09.086 --> 43:10.169
Wait!

43:22.182 --> 43:24.976
I just got an urgent message
from the office.

43:25.644 --> 43:26.811
I need to go.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.479
Then what about us?

43:28.564 --> 43:31.566
For a first meeting,
this is enough.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.277
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.781
Then when will you call?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.283
Sir...

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
What?

43:49.668 --> 43:53.671
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.006
He's a very busy man.

43:55.090 --> 43:58.176
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.678
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?

44:00.804 --> 44:02.096
I should have said more.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.183
Right, who cares about
the mirror?

44:05.309 --> 44:08.394
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?

44:10.564 --> 44:13.149
I knew it.

44:13.275 --> 44:16.361
That rotten little scoundrel.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.446
Thatjerk never came
to visit me even once.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.077
But Do-joon,

44:24.578 --> 44:29.290
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?

44:30.751 --> 44:32.460
Then you never met him.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.006
And the golf balls,

44:37.299 --> 44:41.094
he knew about those, right?

44:55.359 --> 44:59.278
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.

44:59.905 --> 45:01.989
He's not in now.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.742
His car is outside.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.495
He's really not here.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.372
He is, isn't he?

45:10.374 --> 45:11.582
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!

45:11.667 --> 45:13.084
Oh, look who's here!

45:13.210 --> 45:14.919
- Sir, I...
- Yes?

45:15.003 --> 45:17.755
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...

45:19.383 --> 45:21.551
If he's here, why can't I...

45:21.635 --> 45:23.761
Ma'am,
would you prefer coffee?

45:25.889 --> 45:27.640
To be honest,
about your case,

45:27.766 --> 45:32.895
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.

45:32.980 --> 45:33.980
Here, have some.

45:34.106 --> 45:37.567
I understand you feel impatient.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.652
But what can we do?

45:39.778 --> 45:41.988
You just need to wait patiently.

45:42.114 --> 45:46.909
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!

45:46.994 --> 45:49.287
Ma'am!

45:49.580 --> 45:52.081
Let me be honest with you.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.084
In monetary terms,

45:55.169 --> 45:56.377
ifthis were Seoul,

45:56.462 --> 45:58.379
the fee we're charging

45:58.464 --> 46:01.758
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.

46:01.842 --> 46:07.096
You should understand that.

46:19.109 --> 46:21.277
This is Jin-tae's house.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.656
I'm out right now,
so leave me a message.

46:26.283 --> 46:29.744
If you are interested
in fishing equipment or bait

46:29.828 --> 46:35.833
You can call me at
010-31 54-1406.

47:51.785 --> 47:53.369
Son of a bitch.

47:59.209 --> 48:03.880
Files on Scientific Investigation

49:12.741 --> 49:14.283
Blood...

50:07.796 --> 50:08.796
Stop.

50:13.510 --> 50:16.387
I said stop.

50:16.805 --> 50:18.764
Let me look at this first.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.182
Let me take this offfirst.

50:22.060 --> 50:25.062
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.

50:25.188 --> 50:26.856
Okay, okay.

50:27.941 --> 50:30.192
There you go.

50:30.277 --> 50:34.196
Shit, this is the climax.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.748
Spa-ghet-ti!

51:28.043 --> 51:29.293
Ti-ra-mi-su!

51:31.671 --> 51:32.588
Tsu-na-mi!

51:32.672 --> 51:33.672
Mi-ner-al!

51:33.757 --> 51:34.757
Al-arm!

51:35.383 --> 51:36.759
Arm-a-dil-lo!

54:46.074 --> 54:47.574
Where's Je-mun?

54:49.244 --> 54:51.495
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?

54:51.579 --> 54:52.663
Out of my way.

55:01.589 --> 55:03.257
Push this.

55:05.176 --> 55:06.885
It's not yours, right?

55:06.970 --> 55:08.345
Yes!

55:09.806 --> 55:10.681
Do I look pretty?

55:10.807 --> 55:11.807
She put way too much on.

55:11.891 --> 55:15.602
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?

55:20.066 --> 55:22.860
Is this what you do together?

55:24.571 --> 55:26.864
Lucky bastard.

55:30.493 --> 55:33.370
Watch this part, here.

55:34.247 --> 55:37.875
That's what it is, lipstick?

55:39.002 --> 55:40.586
But do you play golf?

55:41.379 --> 55:42.379
Me, golf?

55:42.505 --> 55:45.883
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.

55:46.009 --> 55:47.509
Excuse me. Sir?

55:49.262 --> 55:52.264
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?

55:53.350 --> 55:56.977
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.

55:57.437 --> 56:00.356
All right,
tell them not to bother.

56:23.171 --> 56:24.171
Wait!

56:24.964 --> 56:30.761
Take an umbrella.

57:10.802 --> 57:11.885
Wait a minute.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.175
I went to pick you up
at the station.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.721
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.

58:05.982 --> 58:08.525
Welcome, ma'am.

58:09.152 --> 58:12.696
We started without you.

58:12.780 --> 58:14.698
You, wait outside.

58:15.366 --> 58:18.869
Have a seat.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.789
You've had quite a day today.

58:23.458 --> 58:26.168
I heard it from the police chief.

58:26.711 --> 58:29.546
I feel so sad for you.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.176
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.

58:35.470 --> 58:38.680
Ah, you have a fine wit.

58:40.683 --> 58:41.892
Pass her a drink.

58:44.979 --> 58:48.565
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?

58:49.275 --> 58:51.068
The Red Devils,

58:51.194 --> 58:52.694
Gus Hiddink!

58:54.364 --> 58:57.991
Four years passed in a flash

58:58.451 --> 59:01.703
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.081
But then suddenly
it was 2006.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.918
The Germany World Cup!

59:08.586 --> 59:11.630
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.

59:12.465 --> 59:14.967
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

59:16.052 --> 59:17.344
Regarding Do-joon,

59:18.471 --> 59:20.973
let's send him off
forjust four years.

59:24.060 --> 59:26.061
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,

59:26.646 --> 59:29.565
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.278
Ma'am!

59:35.071 --> 59:37.281
We need to think realistically.

59:37.365 --> 59:42.494
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!

59:49.377 --> 59:50.460
Music!

59:54.090 --> 59:58.093
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.

59:58.886 --> 01:00:04.266
To my right,
my high school classmate,

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:06.810
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,

01:00:06.894 --> 01:00:09.479
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.567
Hey, wake him up?

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.570
And next to me

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:19.990
my bar exam classmate,

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:22.659
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:25.537
He's handsome.

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.873
What? Are you holding a protest?

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.876
He's smashed
afterjust a few drinks.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.169
Mr. Gong!

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:38.091
Look, my son is...

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:56.211
Do-joon!

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.762
Why are you so late?

01:02:10.476 --> 01:02:12.185
You've been drinking, haven't you?

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.771
It's so late...

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.398
Did you eat?

01:02:20.194 --> 01:02:21.194
Eat?

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:24.781
I was wondering if you ate.

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:27.784
Thanks so much for asking.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:31.121
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.831
How could you
do this to me, bitch!

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:39.463
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.257
Forget that.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.260
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.262
In cash.

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:51.475
All I have right now...

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.019
it's not much...

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:56.021
Wait...

01:02:56.105 --> 01:03:05.572
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.

01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:07.365
Take this for now.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.833
Okay.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.005
Send the rest to my bank account.

01:03:22.089 --> 01:03:24.090
I'll text you the account number.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.385
You know what texting is?

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:42.734
Wait. By the way,

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:46.571
that dead girl, Moon Ah-jung.

01:03:48.282 --> 01:03:49.866
Do you know anything about her?

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.748
Actually there were
rumors about her from way back.

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:02.379
It's not nice to talk
this way about the dead,

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.884
but rumors are rumors.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:11.096
Look,

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:14.266
there are only three motives
for murder.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:18.478
Money, passion,
and vengeance.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.940
Try to think this through.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:26.111
That poor kid living on the hill,
what kind of money could she have?

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.780
So it must be

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:33.368
either passion or vengeance.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.204
So we need to start

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.373
by investigating
the people around her.

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.794
But those fuckers
on the police force

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.088
found that golf ball

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.465
and just close the case?

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.925
Exactly.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.763
Do-joon is the
obvious scapegoat for them.

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:57.934
If it were me,
I'd never investigate like that.

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.938
Sorry, I didn't know
you thought that way.

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:09.279
Of course. Do-joon has been
totally fucked over.

01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:11.781
I'm his friend after all.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.785
Thank you, Jin-tae.

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.290
Don't cry!
This is no time to cry.

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:22.584
Quit it!

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:31.760
Anyway,

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:37.098
Do you know
what the strangest thing is?

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:43.855
The roof.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:50.195
The body was left on the roof.
That dead girl.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.282
Usually you bury a dead body.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.202
But in this case,
it was hoisted up.

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:02.207
Her body was
practically put out on display.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.751
Like hanging out laundry.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.048
'Look, everyone,

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.594
I murdered this fucking bitch.

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.222
Do you see the corpse?'

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.310
That sort ofthing...

01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:56.594
Look.

01:06:57.388 --> 01:07:01.266
If you put the body there,
the whole town can see it.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.936
Anyway this neighborhood
is pretty strange.

01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:06.855
So my point is...

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:09.774
Don't trust anyone.

01:07:10.776 --> 01:07:12.193
You don't need them.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.404
Don't even trust me.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.284
You go out and find the real killer.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.389
Do-joon,

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:45.685
you're trying hard to remember
that night, right?

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.860
If you recall
or remember something,

01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:56.571
be sure to tell just me.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:01.076
Only to me.
Do you understand?

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.579
What about that lawyer?

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.749
I fired him.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:17.759
You printed the memorial photo
for Moon Ah-jung, right?

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:27.143
She's a real pretty girl.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.895
That's why
'pretty girls have no luck.'

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.481
Isn't it 'pretty girls die young?'

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.149
That's why she left us early.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.778
That girl, her mother died early

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.279
and her father ran off
with another woman.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.573
Her relatives are
a bunch of bitches too.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.285
That young thing got
by all on her own.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.287
She must have been
lonely as hell.

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.287
Who're you talking about?

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:50.041
Ah-jung.
They say she had a boyfriend.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.167
Who?

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.502
Crazy JP.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:53.962
Crazy JP from the sanatorium?

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:56.171
No fucking way.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.508
Crazy JP is ugly as hell.

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:02.303
It's true.
Ah-jung really liked boys.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:03.680
They say she couldn't
even take a nap by herself.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.682
Those are all lies.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:07.892
Ah-jung's nickname
was Rice Cake Girl.

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.060
Rice Cake?

01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:11.854
Did she eat lots of rice cake?

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.481
I bet she ate fish cake too.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:18.653
Isn't there anything else
you kids remember about her?

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:22.407
I remember
seeing her from the back.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.410
She wore a backpack.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.162
White calves.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.790
Are you sure she was alone?

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.167
There was nobody else?

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:42.176
From Manhattan up to that place,

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:45.054
you saw no one else?

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:46.973
You see him?

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:51.144
Go over and call him retard.

01:09:51.228 --> 01:09:52.228
And then what?

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:56.232
It's fucking hilarious.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:09:59.986
You gotta try it.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.697
You guarantee me
this will be funny?

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:04.407
Just try.

01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:09.495
Retard!

01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:19.464
Hey retard!

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:27.680
What the fuck,
I feel like an idiot.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.892
Here he comes!

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.895
How could you do that?

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:35.271
Why would you fight...

01:10:35.773 --> 01:10:37.774
I told you to meditate.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.984
That's what I was doing.
Shoot...

01:10:40.694 --> 01:10:42.779
Quiet down.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.781
You don't know anything, mom.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:47.492
Sure, your mom
doesn't know anything.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:48.910
What would I know?

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:52.038
Why don't you just keep quiet?

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:57.585
You told me if anyone insults me,
I should kick their ass.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.255
Sure, ifthey insult you...

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:01.256
Kick their ass.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.340
Ifthey hit you once...

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:05.051
Hit back twice.

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:08.972
What about your poor body?

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.765
Did you take your medicine?

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.892
Did they give you some?

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:15.687
But you know,

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:19.357
it's amazing.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:20.692
What?

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:25.863
After I got beaten, I remembered.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.782
The memories came back.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:30.576
You remembered something?

01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:39.877
Something important.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.254
Then what is it?

01:11:42.589 --> 01:11:45.091
That you tried to kill me.

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:51.806
When I was five, right?

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:58.354
You gave me a Bacchus bottle
with insecticide in it.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:09.240
Do-joon!

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:11.367
Are you okay?

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.786
Shit, this is embarrassing.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:14.871
What?

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.873
There are lots of people here.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:19.584
How could you remember?

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:21.794
It's true.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.589
You tried to get rid of me.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.007
How could you say that?

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:29.594
I was so desperate...
I was going to kill both of us.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.763
But you made me drink it first.
The insecticide drink.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.598
Will you shut up?

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:39.979
You had to be first,
so that I could follow.

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.689
Let's step outside.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.610
I was so desperate then.

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.278
You and me are one.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.697
We've only got each other.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.866
Hey, get over here quick!

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.870
How could a five-year-old
remember something like that?

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.290
Ma'am, please stop this.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.167
Let me give you acupuncture.

01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:05.171
There's a meridian point

01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:07.757
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.176
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:12.762
Let me see your thigh.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.348
I'm the only one
who knows this point.

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:19.602
Up your thigh to the partition.
5 inches from here and 3 1/2 again.

01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:21.270
Ma'am!

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.441
Jong-do,

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:28.444
you can see that he's sick inside.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.197
Please let me do it.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.199
Why,

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:37.954
this time you gonna kill me
with your needles?

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:43.167
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get him out!

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.173
Don't ever come again, mom.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.259
I won't see you.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:20.681
This photo...

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:24.685
Can you enlarge it
and print it out clearly?

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:37.698
I should've
used Gramoxon back then.

01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:42.703
If I had, we'd be frolicking
in heaven's flower garden right now,

01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:44.580
instead of suffering.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:47.917
I didn't have the heart,
so I used Lone Star.

01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:49.377
That's a weaker brand.

01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:53.965
So instead of dying, we spent
two days vomiting and shitting water.

01:15:56.051 --> 01:16:00.972
After that, I fed him
all the good stuff in the world...

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:07.061
He was the cutest then.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:09.272
Though he's still cute now.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:14.652
Yeah, in this photo
he's cute as a button.

01:16:15.195 --> 01:16:17.196
It makes you want to
have a baby, huh?

01:16:17.489 --> 01:16:18.489
Yeah.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.826
You will soon. You're taking
the medicine I gave you?

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.077
Sure.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.538
This thing is amazing.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:29.875
There's nothing
you can't do these days.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.462
This is nothing, just the basics.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.385
Just the basics...

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.559
This works great.
It's completely gone.

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:48.185
This is nothing, just the basics.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.271
It came out well.

01:16:50.647 --> 01:16:51.897
Do you like it?

01:16:52.649 --> 01:16:54.900
I wish this would work in the mirror.

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:57.820
By the way,

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:01.073
how much would it cost

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:05.369
to print about
twenty cell phone pictures?

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:07.288
Not sure.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.374
But why would you
want to print those anyway?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.668
The quality won't be very good.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.796
Well,

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.090
it's just a memento.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:27.183
Shit.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.310
Here's a tissue.

01:17:32.564 --> 01:17:36.067
This happens
to you like every day.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.570
Why don't you go see a doctor?

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.739
It's too expensive.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.075
Right,

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:47.745
the one with the nosebleed
was Ah-Jung.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.289
But why cell phone photos?

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.167
The photos...

01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:57.296
are pretty awesome.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:17:59.298
Ma'am,

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:04.178
You've got plenty of rice,
and the water works.

01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:08.557
And you have rice liquor, I see.
Do you have a cell phone?

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:11.477
Why? You wanna buy me one?

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:15.356
Or even better,
just give me the money.

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:17.983
Your land line is dead,
that's why.

01:18:18.652 --> 01:18:20.736
Who knows, ask Ah-jung.

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:24.198
That bitch left home
and hasn't come back.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.751
Wow, the poop is spinning.

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.838
Where can I get that done?

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:23.382
I made it myself.

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.092
Really?

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:29.555
I like that kind ofthing too.
I want one. Like this.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.018
That model is kind oftoo old.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:38.397
She's really good at that.
She makes pervert phones too.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.025
- If you pay her.
- Shut up.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.195
Earn lots of cash, bye.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.280
What's a pervert phone?

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:52.077
When cellphones take pictures,
they always make a sound.

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:54.163
Cheese, ding!

01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:56.290
I just tweak it
to remove the sound.

01:19:56.374 --> 01:19:58.000
For hidden cameras.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:01.754
I'd like that
even more than the poop.

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:08.594
You're a master.
Where did you learn all this?

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:13.182
It's just a hobby
and part-time job.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:24.985
Did you do this for
that poor girl Ah-jung?

01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:30.366
You know where
her cell phone is, don't you?

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.659
Ma'am.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:37.373
Do you have it?

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.666
What?

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.669
A menstrual pad.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.756
I haven't used one in ages.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:50.094
There's a store across the street.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:52.346
Could you go buy me some?

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:55.099
I'm so sorry.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:57.935
Why'd this happen all of a sudden?
It's not time yet.

01:21:01.481 --> 01:21:04.775
Don't go anywhere, okay?

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.387
- I know you have it, bitch.
- I don't.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:37.850
Hey! Ifwe find it on you,
you're dead meat.

01:21:37.934 --> 01:21:39.560
Fuck, I'm gonna search you.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:41.937
Look in her bag.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:44.690
Ifwe find it,
we're gonna rip your head off.

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:47.693
I know you have it bitch.
Where did you stash it?

01:21:47.777 --> 01:21:49.278
I really don't have it.

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:53.699
You were the only friend she had.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:54.950
Tell me now.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.829
We're busy guys, okay?

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.957
So answer us
before we get mean.

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.668
I don't know, assholes!

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.464
Cute.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.843
You know,
your face looks unbalanced.

01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:16.680
You can use a little symmetry,

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.098
couldn't you?

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.851
Spilling blood over
a stupid cell phone.

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:23.854
Where's Ah-jung's phone,
you fucking bitch!

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:24.980
Tell us, you slut!

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.741
Who's this fooling around
in my workplace?

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:38.452
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:22:38.578 --> 01:22:40.579
I said what are you doing, fuckers!

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:43.374
Answer me! Get out of here!

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.668
Hey, push me.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.379
Stop! Stop!

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:55.052
If I see you back here,
you're dead!

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:01.308
Yeah, so where are you now?

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:04.770
I need your help.

01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:07.356
Can you come over here now?

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:10.651
Yeah, now.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.700
Who are these little shits?

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:00.951
Let go of me.

01:24:01.077 --> 01:24:03.078
And who the fuck are you?

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.789
You in your stupid fucking hat?

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:06.957
You shithead.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.210
Why are you looking for
Ah-jung's cell phone?

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.974
Were you one of
her boyfriends, too?

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:33.692
Rice Cake Girl, for sure.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:34.777
Rice Cake?

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.404
Don't you know that?

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.865
Give her rice and fuck her.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:43.327
Have your cake,
and eat it, too.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:47.122
Ah-jung, you poor thing...

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:48.457
I know things are hard, but still...

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.877
How could you
take rice instead of cash?

01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:55.756
Fuck! Ifthe Schoolgirl Pussy
for Money Union finds out,

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.132
I'll get expelled!

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.592
If you take rice one more time,
you're dead.

01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:02.054
Cut it Out, dude. Fuck it all.

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:04.681
You're the bastard
who paid her in rice!

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.309
Get out! That was crazy JP
who stole rice

01:25:07.393 --> 01:25:09.144
- from the sanatorium.
- Fuck off, asshole!

01:25:09.312 --> 01:25:10.771
It's true!

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.899
Pretty Ah-jung had
turned all cold,

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:16.151
and you kept insisting.

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.958
Ma'am, listen to this.

01:25:32.877 --> 01:25:34.503
It's in my blood.

01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:37.172
I should have been a fuckin' cop.

01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:40.801
Moon Ah-jung's cell-phone...

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:46.807
Ifthose pictures ever get out,
lots of guys will suffer.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.937
That phone is an atomic bomb.

01:25:52.772 --> 01:25:56.650
She photographed them all
with her pervert phone,

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:58.777
those guys she fucked.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.572
It must be
two soccer teams or more.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.658
So,

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:06.493
were you on the soccer team too?

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:09.413
How could you say that?

01:26:10.081 --> 01:26:13.667
But I was actually
quite close to her,

01:26:13.793 --> 01:26:14.960
in a spiritual way.

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:19.089
Back then I asked her.

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.799
Hey Ah-jung,

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.553
did you really take pictures
of all those guys?

01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:28.557
Sure I did.

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.559
Hey, am I in there too?

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:34.229
Why? Are you scared?

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.858
You think I'll blackmail you?

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:42.154
Give me a break.
Me scared of you?

01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:46.783
I'm sick of it...

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.162
What?

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.164
Sick of cocks?

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:57.586
I hate all this.

01:26:59.964 --> 01:27:02.382
I should throw
this damn phone away.

01:27:04.135 --> 01:27:06.970
A perfectly good phone?

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:10.474
Just delete the photos!

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.145
I don't want to.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.990
I'm sure
he's there among the photos.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:28.784
The guy who killed her.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.579
But that idiot Yoon Do-joon

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:34.331
sure got fucked over.

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:40.045
Yeah, that retard

01:27:40.171 --> 01:27:43.757
never even saw her panties,
and then he gets blamed.

01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:45.759
That's enough.

01:27:45.885 --> 01:27:48.345
Hey, I heard that
Do-joon sleeps with his mom?

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.346
I said shut up!

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:52.599
Does he just sleep?
Or does he fuck her?

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:23.255
What the hell?

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.508
Who are you?

01:28:33.099 --> 01:28:35.600
Wait, don't move.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.242
Tell me.

01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:57.080
Is that really all you know
about the cell phone?

01:28:58.374 --> 01:29:01.585
Not again...

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:07.507
Why don't you all leave me alone
for Christ's sake!

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:13.680
Well...

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:19.978
I remember
her saying something...

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.688
Like...

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.151
If I traded this cell phone
for rice liquor,

01:29:26.277 --> 01:29:27.986
how many bottles would I get?

01:29:28.988 --> 01:29:30.781
What, are you drinking
rice liquor now too?

01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:06.066
Mom!

01:30:06.692 --> 01:30:12.364
Mom! Visit!

01:30:12.698 --> 01:30:14.449
I remember! I remember!

01:30:14.617 --> 01:30:17.702
Mom! Call mom!

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:20.330
Mom!

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:22.874
Granny!

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.589
Are you home?

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:59.953
Granny!

01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:07.252
Ah-jung sent you!

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:13.967
The money?

01:31:29.275 --> 01:31:31.776
Is that it?

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:34.362
Is that all she sent?

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:40.160
By the way,
where's Ah-jung's cell phone?

01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:42.704
The phone?

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:51.379
I already traded it for rice liquor.

01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:55.300
You're lying.

01:31:56.886 --> 01:32:00.430
Ah-jung told me
to be sure to bring it back.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:05.769
That crazy tramp
keeps taking it back.

01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:17.090
Look closely.

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:23.805
No, no...

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.560
He had white hair,

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:30.979
an old man.

01:33:55.671 --> 01:33:58.006
I've seen this man before.

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.990
Hello?

01:35:48.117 --> 01:35:49.659
Is anyone home?

01:35:57.376 --> 01:35:58.543
Who are you?

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:01.171
Do you see me?

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.466
Have a seat.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.553
But why have you come
to a place like this?

01:36:08.679 --> 01:36:13.850
I'm from a volunteer organization
called Hyeminwon.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.396
We provide free medical checks
for elderly people living alone.

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:20.273
For free?

01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:24.402
We also provide
free acupuncture...

01:36:24.987 --> 01:36:27.071
All sorts ofthings.

01:36:28.741 --> 01:36:30.658
I've heard ofthem, Hyeminwon.

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.745
Since you're here,
let's have a chat.

01:36:34.997 --> 01:36:37.290
It's cold.

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:44.380
I've seen you before.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.174
I don't think so.

01:36:48.385 --> 01:36:49.761
Maybe not.

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:52.764
Anyway stay awhile
now that you're here.

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:57.977
- You can sleep over if you want.
- You're quite a joker.

01:36:58.062 --> 01:37:00.855
Are you sick anywhere?

01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:03.650
No place in particular.

01:37:03.734 --> 01:37:06.736
But my heart's
not so good these days.

01:37:07.738 --> 01:37:09.364
Your heart?

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:14.369
Actually not long ago,
I saw something I shouldn't have.

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:17.372
At my age it was a shock.

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:20.375
I felt it in my whole body.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.001
It's good that I came.

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:23.503
There's a meridian point

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:26.589
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:30.385
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:31.553
On the thigh...

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:34.848
Oh, should I take off my pants?

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:38.476
Just a minute.
I need to prepare first.

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:42.188
Anyway,

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:45.859
what did you see,
a traffic accident?

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:49.487
You're curious, aren't you?

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:56.369
I haven't told a soul about this.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:38:00.790
Tell me.
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:05.378
You remember that incident
in this town a while back?

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:07.171
The murder case.

01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:11.467
When that young girl was killed.

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:17.390
The house where it took place
had been abandoned for a long time.

01:38:19.184 --> 01:38:23.855
I happened to be there that night.

01:38:28.944 --> 01:38:31.195
Careful, it's hot.

01:38:32.781 --> 01:38:37.285
Actually, I sometimes go there.

01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:40.371
It's quiet there,
being empty and all.

01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:46.753
But that night, that girl came in.

01:38:48.839 --> 01:38:50.965
And behind her,

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:54.093
some strange guy
was following her...

01:38:54.178 --> 01:39:07.774
You don't like guys?

01:39:30.381 --> 01:39:31.381
Hey!

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:36.678
Do you know me?

01:39:37.972 --> 01:39:39.222
No...

01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:41.391
I said, do you know me?

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:45.186
Nope.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:46.479
Then why...

01:39:49.191 --> 01:39:50.858
I hate guys.

01:39:54.196 --> 01:39:57.031
So don't talk to me like that,
you stupid retard.

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.558
Shit!

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:13.399
Hey!

01:41:16.153 --> 01:41:17.987
Why are you lying there?

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.755
Hey! Are you hurt?

01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:36.881
No!

01:41:36.965 --> 01:41:39.050
You must have seen it wrong!

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:40.676
What's gotten into you?

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.887
You must have seen it wrong.

01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:46.682
They say Yoon Do-joon is innocent,
that he'll be released soon.

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:48.601
They're going to
re-open the investigation.

01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:49.769
Really?

01:41:50.312 --> 01:41:53.606
That's what the cops said.

01:41:53.690 --> 01:41:55.316
That's nonsense!

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.152
I saw his face with my own eyes.

01:41:58.654 --> 01:42:00.947
It was him for sure!
Yoon Do-joon.

01:42:01.031 --> 01:42:03.282
He threw that rock

01:42:04.576 --> 01:42:08.871
and he made
these weird movements.

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:13.167
How could they let him out now?

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:17.046
Anyway they caught the right guy.

01:42:17.673 --> 01:42:21.300
I better call and report it myself.
Those idiots...

01:42:25.597 --> 01:42:27.807
Where's the number?

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:35.773
No!

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:41.779
Never, no! No!

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.491
No way, you trash!

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:56.669
You're not even worth
the dirt on my son's toenail.

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:38.753
What do I do?

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:41.130
What do I do? Mom...

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:36.188
Ma'am!

01:51:37.732 --> 01:51:39.191
We caught the killer.

01:51:43.279 --> 01:51:44.571
Do you remember?

01:51:45.073 --> 01:51:47.491
I think I mentioned it before.

01:51:48.576 --> 01:51:50.994
JP, who ran away
from the sanatorium.

01:51:51.496 --> 01:51:54.665
He was... Where was it?

01:51:54.749 --> 01:51:56.583
- Mt. Dogye.
- That's right.

01:51:56.668 --> 01:51:57.668
They caught him there.

01:51:57.752 --> 01:52:00.379
Anyway, on his shirt,

01:52:00.463 --> 01:52:03.549
they found some bloodstains.

01:52:03.633 --> 01:52:07.386
They analyzed it
and it matched with Moon Ah-jung,

01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:09.388
so it's game over.

01:52:09.472 --> 01:52:13.267
A golf ball can't
compare to evidence like that.

01:52:13.643 --> 01:52:18.105
Why did he do it?

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:22.484
Well, he's not
what you call normal.

01:52:23.111 --> 01:52:27.573
It could have ended
in attempted rape, don't you think?

01:52:27.657 --> 01:52:31.827
Sure. But according to him,

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:35.539
it was all because of love.

01:52:35.665 --> 01:52:37.666
He says he's Ah-jung's boyfriend.

01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:40.544
And the bloodstains,

01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:44.089
he says the two ofthem
were going at it passionately

01:52:44.174 --> 01:52:48.093
and then she got a nosebleed.

01:52:48.178 --> 01:52:54.099
Wow, that kid
can think pretty fast.

01:52:55.685 --> 01:52:56.852
But ma'am,

01:52:57.687 --> 01:53:00.022
Do you really
need to go and see JP?

01:53:33.848 --> 01:53:37.184
Do you have parents?

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.363
Have you got a mom?

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:13.345
Don't cry.

01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:18.934
ma'am

01:55:13.281 --> 01:55:14.573
Yoon Do-joon!

01:55:20.371 --> 01:55:28.962
Happy release from jail.
Happy release from jail.

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:35.302
Happy being proven innocent,

01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:41.308
happy release from jail.

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.602
Snap the picture.

01:55:43.978 --> 01:55:44.978
Blow!

01:55:46.481 --> 01:55:48.607
Ready, one, two,

01:55:51.653 --> 01:55:53.946
- Congratulations!
- Here too.

01:55:55.865 --> 01:55:57.658
When did you get this car?

01:55:57.742 --> 01:55:59.576
I received some money recently.

01:55:59.661 --> 01:56:01.870
Cool, huh? I ride it every day.

01:56:02.872 --> 01:56:04.289
Does the tofu taste good?

01:56:04.874 --> 01:56:05.958
Yeah.

01:56:08.878 --> 01:56:11.463
What...

01:56:11.756 --> 01:56:13.215
You didn't hear?

01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:16.218
The junk collector's place
burned down.

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:19.221
They said he died.

01:56:41.577 --> 01:56:43.036
Eat up.

01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:46.498
Have some deodeok root, too.

01:56:48.793 --> 01:56:52.587
What happened to the chestnuts?
I put in several.

01:56:57.301 --> 01:56:58.385
Mom.

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.266
I've been... thinking.

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.060
About what?

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:11.773
That crazy JP,

01:57:13.276 --> 01:57:15.861
why'd he put her body up
on the roof,

01:57:16.487 --> 01:57:17.946
way up high?

01:57:19.282 --> 01:57:21.575
Why think about that?

01:57:28.958 --> 01:57:30.500
So I think,

01:57:32.962 --> 01:57:34.838
maybe it was
so people would see her?

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.677
She was bleeding

01:57:40.762 --> 01:57:42.763
she needed to go to the hospital.

01:57:45.058 --> 01:57:49.770
So he put her in a place
where people could see her fast.

01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:57.402
I bet that's it.

01:58:35.399 --> 01:58:36.900
Attention, y'all.

01:58:36.984 --> 01:58:42.280
Passengers on the
Thank-You-Parents Bus Tour,

01:58:42.365 --> 01:58:46.660
Mom, take this on the bus to eat.

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:49.162
You didn't have to buy so much.

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:52.666
You can share it
with the other parents.

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:54.876
Don't leave it behind.

01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:59.589
Oh, I forgot,

01:59:01.050 --> 01:59:03.385
Mom. Here.

01:59:03.511 --> 01:59:04.511
What?

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:07.514
I have something for you.

01:59:07.598 --> 01:59:08.682
What is it?

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:31.496
Well... I found this at
the junk collector's burnt house.

01:59:36.586 --> 01:59:41.673
How could you
leave this lying around?

01:59:51.767 --> 01:59:53.143
Mom...

02:00:14.081 --> 02:00:17.250
Hurry up!
