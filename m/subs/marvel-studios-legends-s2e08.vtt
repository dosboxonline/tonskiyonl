(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:31.823 --> 00:34.909
(WHISTLING)

00:36.077 --> 00:38.204
(WHISTLING)

00:38.955 --> 00:42.584
(WHISTLING)

00:42.667 --> 00:45.462
(SCREAMING)

00:47.881 --> 00:49.632
Ain't quite got the hang of it yet.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.428
YONDU: When I picked you up as a kid...

00:53.970 --> 00:55.138
Welcome home, Peter.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.223
...these boys wanted to eat you.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.018
I saved your life!

01:00.185 --> 01:01.269
No!

01:01.352 --> 01:02.645
Sorry, boy.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.774
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.275
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

01:07.358 --> 01:08.359
GAMORA: Yondu!

01:08.568 --> 01:10.862
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.823
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.076
Billions of people will perish.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.621
At the end of all this, I get the Stone.

01:20.538 --> 01:23.333
PETER: All Ronan's got to do is touch
the Stone to the planet's surface.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.918
Let's go get 'em, boys!

01:25.001 --> 01:26.836
PETER: So Ronan does not make the surface.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.921
Come on!

01:39.057 --> 01:40.850
PETER: We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.604
(SCREAMING)

01:48.900 --> 01:50.110
(LAUGHS)

01:50.193 --> 01:52.403
KRAGLIN: Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.990
It's probably good
we didn't deliver him to his dad

01:56.074 --> 01:57.117
like we was hired to do.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.750
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

02:05.959 --> 02:10.088
The Colors of Ogord
will never flash over your grave.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.965
You broke all our hearts.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
Argh. Pathetic.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.013
First, Quill betrays us
and Yondu just lets him go.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.015
Seems he's goin' soft.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.518
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.522
TASERFACE: You know I'm right, Kraglin.

02:28.356 --> 02:29.357
(WHISTLING)

02:32.402 --> 02:33.444
Hey there, rat!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.281
NEBULA: Your friend.
They are going to kill him!

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
I tell you, it was pretty easy
to find you.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.660
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.414
We ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

02:45.081 --> 02:47.000
-What?
-KRAGLIN: That ain't right.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.211
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.756
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

02:53.840 --> 02:56.634
you protect him
like none of the rest of us much matter!

02:56.718 --> 02:57.760
ALL: Yeah!

02:57.886 --> 02:59.596
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

02:59.679 --> 03:00.722
Take it easy, Kraglin.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.641
Suppose it's time
for a change in leadership.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.643
(EXCLAIMS)

03:06.019 --> 03:07.145
(GRUNTS)

03:09.856 --> 03:12.525
(ALL CHEERING)

03:13.985 --> 03:15.445
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.532
They killed all my friends.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.417
YONDU: Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.714
(WHISTLING)

03:35.632 --> 03:37.634
(ALL SCREAMING)

03:40.261 --> 03:41.304
(GRUNTS)

03:48.144 --> 03:49.229
Where to, Captain?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.521
Let's go fight a planet.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.774
Okay! Good. Wait.

03:52.857 --> 03:53.942
Fight a what?

03:58.112 --> 04:00.198
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.449
T-minus five minutes.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.534
Aye, Captain. (STRAINING)

04:06.871 --> 04:08.915
Yondu, we're about to blow!

04:08.998 --> 04:10.083
Get to the ship!

04:10.917 --> 04:12.335
(STRAINING)

04:14.295 --> 04:15.421
ROCKET: Kraglin, go!

04:38.778 --> 04:40.405
(SHUDDERS)

04:40.488 --> 04:41.781
PETER: It's a Ravager funeral.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.909
Yeah!

04:45.076 --> 04:46.119
Yeah!

04:55.336 --> 04:57.130
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.009
Thanks...

05:03.136 --> 05:04.137
Captain.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.476
KRAGLIN: Oh, hey, guys.
PETER: Kraglin.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.353
You've been here this whole time?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.230
Yeah. You said to stay with the ship.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.315
This is Glenda.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.566
We're married.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.234
Pfft. (LAUGHS) I am Groot.
