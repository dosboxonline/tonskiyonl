-[Anna] So he was just standing--
-I told you everything.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.026
I know, I just thought,
maybe now that you'd rested...

19:54.109 --> 19:56.695
[sighs] I hid under the rail overpass
in the drains.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.574
I saw the tornado comin',
and when I woke up, he was just...

20:02.284 --> 20:03.577
He was kinda just there.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.623
-Did you have another episode?
-I don't...

20:10.626 --> 20:11.543
Probably.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.421
It's all kind of a blur.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.889
-Where are you going?
-I'm just goin' to the bathroom.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.934
[sighs] I'm okay, Mom.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.962
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.256
I was... just...

20:58.006 --> 20:59.758
-Everything all right in there?
-Mm.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.135
As well as can be expected...

21:03.011 --> 21:06.223
-under the circumstances.
-How are you? You holdin' up okay?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.350
-I'm fine.
-And Rebecca, is she...

21:08.433 --> 21:10.435
She's... good.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.521
-Better.
-Good, good. That's good.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.857
We were lucky, huh?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.235
So lucky.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.156
The church is the only building
still standin'.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.034
The only one.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.829
Yeah.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.125
-We were lucky.
-Just goes to show you, you can't ever...

21:33.208 --> 21:34.042
You just...

21:34.418 --> 21:35.919
You can't ever give up.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.587
You can't.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.758
-Felix...
-I got him a lawyer.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.136
-What?
-Won't cost us a cent.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.013
She's pro bono. ACLU.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.557
Old friend made some calls.
You remember Kip?

21:48.640 --> 21:51.226
-Kip from Princeton?
-Yeah, no, I know who he is.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.687
I'm just... I'm havin' a hard time
keepin' up with you.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.272
Somethin' happened here.

21:55.772 --> 21:56.940
Somethin' big.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.277
None of this is a coincidence.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.573
It was meant to happen, Anna.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.783
It was meant to happen.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.995
All of this.

I-- I just need some time with him, ma'am.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.090
JTTF already have him.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.674
Then you need to leave that to the FBI.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.760
This is our only opportunity to get intel.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.929
He didn't just click his heels
and end up here.

23:09.012 --> 23:12.265
He clearly had help.
This is bigger than just him.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.185
It's only a matter of time
before everybody knows where he is.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.813
<i>I need to talk to him now,</i>
<i>before this whole thing blows up.</i>

23:18.188 --> 23:19.481

24:08.989 --> 24:09.906
What do you got?

24:09.990 --> 24:12.159
A private jet from here in Amman.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.579
It was forced to land
at Quetzalcóatl International in Mexico

24:15.662 --> 24:16.496
due to bad weather.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.873

24:19.374 --> 24:21.251
<i>-Did you get that?</i>
-Yeah, I heard.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.754
Amman, Jordan to Quetzalcóatl, Mexico.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.216
He must have crossed over from there.
It's five miles from the airport.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.134
<i>What is?</i>

24:29.217 --> 24:30.302
<i>The US border.</i>

24:30.385 --> 24:33.513
<i>We've got the tail number.</i>
<i>The plane belongs to a charter company.</i>

24:33.597 --> 24:36.725
They won't reveal their client list,
so it's going to take a little more time.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.061
-Let me know what you find.
<i>-Okay.</i>

24:46.151 --> 24:47.736
Can you please pull over?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.833
[man] Officer Geller,
they told me you were comin'.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.128
Will Mathers, Joint Terrorism Task Force.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.381
It's a pleasure to meet you.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.384
Sure got down here fast.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.095
I need to speak to the detainee.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.137
Yeah, I heard.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.181
Not gonna happen, I'm sorry.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.850
Actually, it is going to happen.

26:01.351 --> 26:05.188
He crossed the border after landing
in Mexico on a private plane from Jordan.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.399
Well, that doesn’t matter much now.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.359
The scope of this goes
well beyond domestic.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.320
This is foreign intelligence.
My jurisdiction.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.032
The boys over in the counter-terrorism
division might beg to differ.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.909
I’ve been covering this guy
from the beginning.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.412
The longer you stand in my way,
the worse things are gonna get.

26:20.495 --> 26:24.124
Well, I’m not standing in your way.
His ACLU lawyer is.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.545
-Your boy's been busy.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.008

27:24.643 --> 27:27.312
Yeah, but so far
it's just a couple of personal posts.

27:29.814 --> 27:30.649

Uh... No, I just got in.
Last minute flight. Work's crazy.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.774
Well, are you managing to get some rest?

29:36.691 --> 29:39.444
I would be,
if it weren't for these late night calls.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.531
Well, uh, you know,
since you're awake now anyway,

29:43.615 --> 29:46.034
