BRIE LARSON: The first time
I got to play Carol Danvers

00:12.637 --> 00:14.639
was on the set of Avengers.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.810
And it was a big surprise.

00:18.893 --> 00:22.689
They just said, "Brie, if you just
go up these stairs, you can go on set."

00:22.772 --> 00:24.607
I had no idea who was there.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.818
I didn't know what scene I was shooting.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.069
And I was thrust in.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.654
Suddenly, the cameras were rolling.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.614
MAN: Whiskey 603 Charlie, take one.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.702
LARSON: I was completely starstruck.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.580
It was an incredible moment.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.623
Our hero... Brie Larson.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.333
(CHEERING)

00:44.294 --> 00:47.005
LARSON: It's just...
There's too many things to say

00:47.088 --> 00:49.466
that are the best parts
of being Carol Danvers.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.134
(CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:52.135 --> 00:56.181
Every time I get the opportunity
to play her, I grow.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.896
These movies are so big and there's
so much you're kind of learning as you go,

01:03.772 --> 01:05.899
it can feel really overwhelming at first.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.320
And now at this point,
I feel like I have a sense of ease.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.780
I know how to train.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.452
It's all about just being
as prepared as possible,

01:18.870 --> 01:20.371
because once we start filming,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
I have no idea what I'm in for.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.227

DIRECTOR: Yeah, okay.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.605
Here we go. Ready. And action.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.191
Marvels is happening. It's cool.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.152
Welcome to my happy place.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.488
So, this is Kamala's bedroom.

01:53.571 --> 01:57.075
Fun fact. Iman Vellani's head
actually looks like this.

01:57.992 --> 02:02.413
When I first got here,
it was like two workouts a day,

02:02.497 --> 02:04.666
training, craziness.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.501
It's been really, really fun.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.838
Kamala's bedroom is just
everything a Marvel fan wants.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.966
All the love of the superheroes,
it's just all around you,

02:13.049 --> 02:16.636
and I think that's the coolest part
of playing a character

02:16.719 --> 02:19.097
that is obsessed with superheroes,
like I am.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.182
It's like I'm in my own bedroom, you know?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.977
PARRIS: I love that I get this opportunity

02:24.394 --> 02:28.565
to get to dive deeper into who Monica is
in the world of the Marvels.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.066
All right, just some...

02:30.608 --> 02:32.443
I think I'm distracting him.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.697
I could not be happier
to be at a place like this

02:35.780 --> 02:40.201
and also the fact that I'm surrounded by
so many cool women and powerful people,

02:40.285 --> 02:42.162
you know, working alongside me.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.080
It's been a real blessing, I think.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.707
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-And, cut.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.169
It was amazing to work on a film

02:49.294 --> 02:52.338
with three lady heroes,
a badass lady villain,

02:52.422 --> 02:54.716
and many, many lady department heads.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.470
Female producer, female director.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.847
It was pretty great.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.765
DIRECTOR: Camera set. And action!

03:02.849 --> 03:04.976
NIA DaCOSTA: The first step
coming to direct this movie

03:05.101 --> 03:07.770
was that I told everyone
I wanted to do a Marvel movie

03:07.854 --> 03:09.939
for as long as I possibly could. (LAUGHS)

03:10.899 --> 03:14.027
Eventually my agent came to me and said,
"Hey, like, Captain Marvel 2."

03:14.110 --> 03:16.404
And then as I got more information,
it was Captain Marvel

03:16.487 --> 03:19.032
and Monica Rambeau and Ms. Marvel.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.451
When I heard about Ms. Marvel,
I was really excited.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.077
She's one of my favorite characters
from the comics.

03:25.914 --> 03:31.085
I read Ms. Marvel when it first came out
and I thought it was so fun

03:31.169 --> 03:33.588
and so awesome.
And I related to her so much,

03:33.671 --> 03:36.841
'cause like I was a big nerd,
from, you know, the tri-state area

03:36.925 --> 03:39.594
who loved superhero stuff and comic stuff,

03:39.677 --> 03:41.721
and she was a nerd who loved that stuff.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.935
The process for me
was basically talking to Mary Livanos,

03:47.018 --> 03:48.436
who was my exec on the movie.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.439
Nia and I met during the height
of the pandemic via Zoom

03:51.522 --> 03:54.067
and primarily,
we just geeked out about comics,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.694
and she pitched an entire Galactus movie.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.280
Right off the bat,
it was a case of kindred spirits.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.327
I love that Nia brought her sense
of fandom to this film.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.496
She brought so many
big ideas to the table.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.123
I think that that exchange of ideas,

04:09.624 --> 04:12.001
that process was how I kind of
showed them like,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.337
"Oh, yeah, I can take on this challenge."

04:15.088 --> 04:17.215
I've cut two of Nia's movies.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.591
Candyman and Little Woods.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
Little Woods was very much a drama.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.638
Candyman was a little more
thriller, horror.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.310
And then this is really fun and exciting
and has a lot of humor.

04:29.394 --> 04:33.982
So I do appreciate that genre-wise,
we've been able to play around a lot

04:34.065 --> 04:36.234
and do a lot of different things together.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.987
MEGAN McDONNELL: Nia's incredible
and she's an incredible director.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.738
But I think something that's huge

04:40.822 --> 04:42.907
is she's also a phenomenal screenwriter.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.285
ELISSA KARASIK:
She has such clarity of vision,

04:45.368 --> 04:48.246
who has kind of these
overarching goals for the characters

04:48.329 --> 04:51.124
and the script,
and gives you a North Star always.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.711
LIVANOS: We've been truly lucky to have
incredible writers on this film.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.381
Elissa Karasik came to us from Team Loki.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.466
She's irreverent and hilarious.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.468
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.596
-What?
-Yes, your friend, Captain Marvel.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.057
She was walking up and down
our living room.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.060
Is Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way?

05:11.185 --> 05:14.314
LIVANOS: And then Megan McDonnell,
who I worked with on WandaVision,

05:14.397 --> 05:17.400
is a brilliant world builder
and sci-fi enthusiast.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.571
She came up with the idea that
our characters are literally entangled.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.741
Our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points

05:24.824 --> 05:28.036
and our susceptibility
to electromagnetic energy

05:28.119 --> 05:31.039
-has temporarily entangled world-lines.
-Yeah, that, right there.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.709
McDONNELL: For us,
entanglement is great thematically

05:34.792 --> 05:38.129
because one, Carol has a team now,
whether she likes it or not.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.465
-Oh, my God, we're a team?
-Oh, no, we're not a team.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.050
-We're not a team.
-(GASPS)

05:42.133 --> 05:44.218
Also, rather than
making her less powerful,

05:44.302 --> 05:46.512
our entanglement requires her to be

05:46.596 --> 05:48.973
more thoughtful about
how she's using her power.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.517
-KAMALA: (IN DISTANCE) Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh!

05:51.601 --> 05:55.813
What makes it so exciting creatively
and so difficult for our characters...

05:55.897 --> 05:56.898
DIRECTOR: Action.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.693
...is she can't just light blast
something or someone

06:00.777 --> 06:03.071
and has to sit in her feelings.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.906
That's really challenging for Carol.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.283
It's a tough one for Carol
because we've realized

06:07.367 --> 06:09.202
that she has sort of decided
to work alone.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.537
So there's a little bit of
this like, protective,

06:11.621 --> 06:14.165
"No, you stay in the ship,
I got this, don't use your powers."

06:14.248 --> 06:17.919
And then in time,
they realize that she needs this.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.797
They can't solve this problem
unless they figure it out together.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.384
You can stand tall without standing alone.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.469
(ENERGY WHOOSHING)

06:27.678 --> 06:30.390
LIVANOS: Entanglement
was a very dynamic idea,

06:30.473 --> 06:33.810
but it was a bit like playing
three-card monte the entire film.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.645
DIRECTOR: Hold it. Hold it.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.980
Very good. Here we go.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.900
Three, two, one. Action!

06:41.275 --> 06:42.443
(GRUNTS)

06:42.944 --> 06:44.404
DaCOSTA: Because of the switching,

06:44.487 --> 06:47.156
we got to do probably
my favorite fights in the movie,

06:47.240 --> 06:48.950
which is the switch fight.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.785
-DIRECTOR: Action.
-(GRUNTING)

06:51.452 --> 06:54.455
DaCOSTA: The first big fight scene
between the three heroes,

06:54.539 --> 06:56.916
seeing them switch,
not knowing what's going on,

06:56.999 --> 06:58.459
not knowing why they're switching,

06:59.377 --> 07:01.796
but also having to fight
in three different locations.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.840
We were first in Kamala's bedroom.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.924
(SCREAMS)

07:05.007 --> 07:07.427
And then she teleported
into Dar-Benn's ship,

07:07.510 --> 07:09.429
and she has no idea it's Dar-Benn's ship.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.890

07:12.974 --> 07:15.977
That switch fight is super fun.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.229

07:18.729 --> 07:20.398
-DIRECTOR: Action!
-(BOTH GRUNTING)

07:20.481 --> 07:23.401
DeMARCO: It was planned really well
by everybody involved.

07:23.484 --> 07:27.738
It was incredibly difficult to plot out,
which Nia did masterfully

07:27.822 --> 07:31.659
along with our stunt team
and all of our department heads.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.662
DaCOSTA: We organized and coordinated
that over a long period of time,

07:34.745 --> 07:37.373
from writing it, shot listing,
who goes where and when,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.584
and all that stuff,
and then going into stuntviz.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.211
It's one of our favorite fights.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.504
Looking at the script beats,

07:43.588 --> 07:45.923
what we need to achieve,
how long we've got to shoot it

07:46.007 --> 07:49.302
and, you know,
just a process of breaking it all down.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.637
DaCOSTA: It was really fun
to put that all together.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.764
For me it was really about
being super detailed

07:53.848 --> 07:55.475
and super organized and specific

07:55.558 --> 07:57.477
because once people
start switching places,

07:57.560 --> 07:59.854
it just gets really, really crazy.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.483
DeMARCO: We did find it
a little in the edit, particularly.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.612
We didn't always know that we'd have
to show both sides of every switch.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.364
When two characters are switching places,

08:10.448 --> 08:12.909
do you follow the character
to their new location,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.703
or do you stay in the location
where you are?

08:16.621 --> 08:18.873
And so there were unlimited
number of combinations.

08:18.956 --> 08:22.502
You have to try every single alternative
in the editing room

08:22.585 --> 08:24.879
because something that
you'd never thought about

08:24.962 --> 08:27.924
could end up being
the absolute best part of the movie.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.592
MUNEEBA: Kamala, are you okay?

08:31.385 --> 08:33.471
DIRECTOR: Go and action, Iman.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.975
The process of creating
entanglement shots on set

08:38.059 --> 08:43.064
would mean that we would often film
each of the hero actors in place.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.400
And know that we would have
to stitch them together later.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.860
(ENERGY CRACKLING)

08:47.944 --> 08:50.071
We'd take action
up to the point of the switch.

08:50.154 --> 08:54.033
Okay, pause, pause,
quickly swap around and then carry on.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.036
It can get confusing at times,
so you have to kind of concentrate.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.289
Oh, who switched with who?
All right, yep. But fun.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.124
One, two, three, go.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.127
Why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

09:05.253 --> 09:06.295
I'm aware.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.425
What was important about the film,
as someone who loves sci-fi,

09:11.509 --> 09:15.012
was how can we make this feel really epic
and make space feel real,

09:15.096 --> 09:17.557
but also fun and scary and all that stuff?

09:20.142 --> 09:21.143

09:22.687 --> 09:23.729
(WHOOSHES)

09:26.524 --> 09:30.695
LAURA KARPMAN: In this film, there's
a lot of stuff that goes down in space.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.656
And I think whenever
you're out in space,

09:33.739 --> 09:38.786
that also has wonderful
musical suggestions.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.462
-Right. That's a good one.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.

09:48.879 --> 09:54.635
There's a huge cinematic history
of what does space sound like.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.513
That was something
that I definitely leaned into exploring.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.473
(SOUND REVERBERATES)

10:01.976 --> 10:05.771
KARPMAN: In space, there is no sound.

10:07.189 --> 10:11.527
You only feel vibrations,
which then feel like sound.

10:13.279 --> 10:18.242
Part of that is because sounds in space
are 60 octaves below

10:18.326 --> 10:20.369
what the human ear can hear.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.957
When I started researching space,
I thought of my friend Evelyn Glennie.

(TRILLING)

10:31.422 --> 10:32.548

10:59.200 --> 11:02.953
of percussion instruments in the world,
here's the incredible thing about her.

(VIBRATING)

11:08.459 --> 11:14.965

which is exactly the kind of essence

11:15.049 --> 11:18.052
we're trying to replicate in the score.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.430
How do you hear through vibrations?

11:30.022 --> 11:32.400
(SINGING) Pa-ra-pa-ra-pa-ra...

11:32.483 --> 11:34.026
And then there's the theme on top.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.237
(INTENSE DRUM MUSIC PLAYING)

11:41.492 --> 11:43.411
(SINGERS VOCALIZING)

11:56.048 --> 11:59.427
KARPMAN: Really early on,
I recorded two small choirs,

11:59.510 --> 12:03.305
and those small choirs
were based in world music traditions,

12:03.389 --> 12:05.808
so we had a South Asian Carnatic singer.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.227
We had three low basses.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.938
We had a really wide rooted group.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.483
What happens is you have kind of this
genderless, otherworldly singing.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.069
(SINGERS VOCALIZING)

12:21.657 --> 12:23.576
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

12:27.705 --> 12:29.749
KARPMAN: All of that
was super experimental,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.877
and I think the reason why it worked well

12:32.960 --> 12:37.256
is because it's sitting in the world
of the epic Marvel sound.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.799
(WHOOSHES)

12:41.302 --> 12:43.053
-(KAMALA GASPS)
-Hold that thought.

12:43.137 --> 12:48.559
We were lucky to have fully realized
characters team up together for this film.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.396
You've got Iman coming from her show.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.898
Teyonah coming from her show.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.025
There's a lot of history
and a lot of backstory.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.943
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.153
When you left...

12:59.236 --> 13:01.781
LARSON: For me playing Carol,
I've got one character

13:01.864 --> 13:05.367
that idolizes me and one that
sees me as extremely flawed. (LAUGHS)

13:05.451 --> 13:08.078
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

13:08.162 --> 13:11.832
A little girl that hung
on your every word.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.920
What's so exciting about putting
these three people together as a writer

13:16.003 --> 13:17.838
-is all of the juicy conflict.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:17.922 --> 13:20.966
These characters fit together so nicely,
and complement each other.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.176
At the core of this movie

13:22.259 --> 13:25.805
is each of their relationships
with the idea of being a superhero.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.600
-(BLASTING)
-(GASPS)

13:29.683 --> 13:31.560
LARSON: It's really important
that we understand

13:31.644 --> 13:35.147
that Captain Marvel
really can't be the thing

13:35.231 --> 13:37.566
standing between life and destruction.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.111
It's not always
about being Captain Marvel.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.113
Sometimes it's about being Carol Danvers.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.032
Maybe we just send it to voice mail.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.161
KARASIK: Brie and Teyonah and Iman

13:49.245 --> 13:51.664
have just brought their characters
to new levels.

13:51.747 --> 13:52.748
Twinsies.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.124
DaCOSTA: It's kind of funny.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.044
All three actresses have lot of qualities
with their characters.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.255
Brie got this job however many years ago,

13:59.338 --> 14:02.007
she has so much determination,
very similar to Carol Danvers.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.760
And then when she got
two other cast members,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.555
she was a leader and made everyone
as comfortable as possible.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.639
DIRECTOR: Action.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.224
(GRUNTS)

14:11.809 --> 14:15.771
It's been really exciting,
really getting to explore the relationship

14:15.855 --> 14:18.774
between Monica and Carol,
what that history is.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.236
What that hurt is,
and how they can hopefully heal.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.531
DaCOSTA: Teyonah Parris
is such a wonderful Monica.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.201
She gave that character
so much depth and spirit.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.787
'Cause she's dealing
with the loss of her mother,

14:31.871 --> 14:33.664
Teyonah just brought
so much beauty to that.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.960
You guys are catching me
at the end of a very long week,

14:38.043 --> 14:41.171
and I just got off the wires
with the harness and stuff,

14:41.255 --> 14:43.173
and I hope they got a good shot.

14:43.257 --> 14:47.845
Lots of craziness happened, but I think
I gave y'all one good take off. (LAUGHS)

14:48.512 --> 14:50.431
You know, we're living the dream here.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.599
Got three fans.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.436
And Iman Vellani is no exception.
She is a huge Marvel nerd.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.397
(LAUGHING) Was that different?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.691
Kamala is Iman. Iman is Kamala.

15:00.774 --> 15:04.570
From day one, I believe
that she was born to play this part.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.197
VELLANI: It's the coolest job,
I could not ask for anything else.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.866
I would literally do this my entire life.

15:08.949 --> 15:12.578
She is like someone who gets frozen
when she meets someone that she admires,

15:12.661 --> 15:14.246
like Kevin Feige or Sam Jackson.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.833
I hid behind our director
when Sam walked in the room.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.544
She's so sweet and just fierce.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.881
I have to call her fierce because
every time I'm like, "You so cute,"

15:23.964 --> 15:25.966
she's like, "I am fierce and strong."

15:26.050 --> 15:29.094
I'm like, "You're fierce and strong, too.
And you are just so cute."

15:29.178 --> 15:30.846
So it's been really, really fun.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.058
DaCOSTA: She really brings this
incredible warmth and humor.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.645
And I think those are all the things
I loved about Ms. Marvel in the comics.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.230
Her casting is absolutely spot on.
It's amazing.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.649
Ammi, we found
Nani's other bangle,

15:41.732 --> 15:43.817
and there's this weirdly beautiful,
terrifying woman

15:43.901 --> 15:46.362
hurting people with the other one,
we have to stop her.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.656
Who is Dar-Benn?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.199
(SCREAMS)

15:50.282 --> 15:54.828
ASHTON: Dar-Benn is the very recent
Supremor of the Kree Empire.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.914
She is a massive contradiction.

15:56.997 --> 16:02.419
She's part rage, part hope,
part science, part war.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.255
The Skrull have betrayed the Kree.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.301
She's basically been born
out of this huge event,

16:09.385 --> 16:12.179
which is Captain Marvel destroying

16:12.262 --> 16:14.723
the Supreme Intelligence
of the Kree Empire.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.891
(EXPLODING)

16:16.350 --> 16:19.478
She has a huge vendetta against her.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.772
The Annihilator destroyed the Kree.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.817
KARASIK: I think about what our heroes
are up against with Dar-Benn,

16:24.900 --> 16:26.652
I think pure conviction.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.656
And I think one of the most
dangerous kinds of villain

16:30.739 --> 16:32.491
is a villain who has nothing left to lose.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.327
(GRUNTS)

16:36.996 --> 16:38.747
(LAUGHING) My God, I...

16:38.831 --> 16:41.834
Zawe just brought
a lot of fun to the character.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.669
She had a really good time playing evil.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.839
Zawe as Dar-Benn,
I didn't know what to expect.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.424
When I first saw her on set,

16:48.507 --> 16:51.093
I was like, "Oh, my gosh,
you look amazing,

16:51.176 --> 16:53.012
"but you also are very scary."

16:53.095 --> 16:55.639
She's quite fierce and intense,

16:56.306 --> 16:59.309
and a little unhinged,
not Zawe, but Dar-Benn.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.478
And then, as soon as they call "cut"...

17:01.562 --> 17:03.397
MAN: Cut! Nice, Zawe. Thank you.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.067
...she's like the warmest,
fuzziest, sweetest person.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.193
(EXCLAIMS)

17:08.277 --> 17:10.696
So it's really this crazy juxtaposition.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.033
(LAUGHING) I can't cope. I can't cope.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.286
I'm having a lot of fun playing Dar-Benn.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.747
I sometimes look around,

17:19.830 --> 17:22.624
and can't quite believe
that I'm in this world.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.334
It's actually really moving.

17:24.418 --> 17:28.589
Because, you know, the MCU's been
at the forefront of cinema,

17:28.672 --> 17:32.468
and so it's a very profound experience.
It's amazing.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.969
(BOTH PANTING)

17:35.554 --> 17:37.514
-(BOTH LAUGH)
-End of film.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.187
DeMARCO: Working for Marvel,
we come with a small army to the set.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.774
As support,
we are often there with director,

17:46.857 --> 17:50.402
with camera, with grips,
feeding back constantly

17:50.486 --> 17:52.821
what will and won't work later.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.824
It's been a great collaborative effort.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.078
We're all part of the same thing.
We're creating the same world.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.748
McLAREN: We do have to work,
you know, closely together.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.042
So every day there'll be a conversation.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.126
BEN COLLINS: It's epic.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.170
When you've kind of
gone through that process

18:08.253 --> 18:12.091
and you see everyone collaborate
and get through all the challenges,

18:12.174 --> 18:13.592
and really, nothing's a problem.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.886
It's just all about working out
how you get there.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.348
And then, that all has to come together
for a specific shoot day.

18:20.015 --> 18:25.938
Nia and Sean and the studio really wanted
to embrace as much real as we could.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.151
The sets for this movie
were huge, (LAUGHS)

18:31.235 --> 18:33.195
because I really wanted to do 360 sets.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.031
I wanted to be able to shoot
as dynamically as possible.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.575
Because the movie was gonna be in space,

18:38.659 --> 18:41.703
I wanted to make sure
whatever was real was actually real

18:41.787 --> 18:44.790
so we wouldn't have
a bunch of CG in space and CG sets.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.209
We're split over two studios.

18:47.292 --> 18:51.588
So fundamentally, we had eight stages,
two back lots, 54 separate sets,

18:51.672 --> 18:55.676
six cranes, five different planets,
a space station, five spaceships,

18:55.759 --> 18:59.513
three evacuation pods,
a space elevator, and a golf course.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.181
-What?
-Yes.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.641
For our little Maria house.

19:03.016 --> 19:06.895
Tremendous, amazing art department,
50-strong construction team,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.272
that's probably 350.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.066
DaCOSTA: One of my favorite sets
is Carol's ship.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.735
(SOFTLY) I'm on Captain Marvel's ship.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.863
(WHOOSHES)

19:18.115 --> 19:21.451
VELLANI: All right,
MCU cribs tours. Carol's ship.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.580
If you've ever wondered what it's like
to be inside someone's brain,

19:24.663 --> 19:25.664
this is it.

19:27.916 --> 19:32.004
We always knew that Carol's ship
was kind of like the Airstream of space,

19:32.087 --> 19:34.756
and she needed to take
everything with her. It's her home.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.092
She's been living on that ship
for 30 years.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.262
It's a cool ship.
She can also be comfortable living there.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.057
When you see a lot of films,
the spaceships are empty

19:44.141 --> 19:46.393
they're devoid of personality,
like an office.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.021
If you're on a spaceship
for a long period of time,

19:49.104 --> 19:50.731
how would you live?

19:51.481 --> 19:53.358
We put in some of her past,

19:53.442 --> 19:56.236
things that kept her amused
while she was in space,

19:56.320 --> 19:57.571
her favorite books.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.657
We included some self-help books,
which Nia thought was hilarious.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.494
All her clothes, her workout kit.
We tried to make it very personal.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.956
My favorite thing on this entire ship.
They didn't let me put it on.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.626
Mostly because my head's not that small.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.670
AZIS: You'll see behind me,
big globes.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.547
These lovely terrariums.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.884
We bought the biospheres
thinking they were a certain size.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.346
The company sent these.
We thought these biospheres were too big.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.806
We put one on set.
It was quite interesting.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.850
We thought she was growing her own food.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.019
We immediately loved it and put more in.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.815
The kitchen. We wanted to really
feel like she did some cooking...

20:33.899 --> 20:34.900
I can't touch it.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.360
...rather than just eat space food.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.196
Pickled radish, cucumber and aubergine.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.447
Konjac ball.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.033
AZIS: She's got a coffee maker,
special knives.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.911
Really, a normal kitchen,
but a space age version of it.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.955
And obviously,
quite a lot of cat references.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.207
Her favorite non-human being.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.334
AZIS: Cat books and photographs.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.378
Cat food, much needed.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.796
AZIS: The whole world of Goose.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.714
"Goose Tunes." My heart.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.383
"Soul of Thunder", "Party Mix."

20:59.466 --> 21:02.427
This is on par with
Star-Lord cassette tapes by the way.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.138
AZIS: Our graphics team
did a wonderful job on the photographs

21:05.222 --> 21:06.890
and on creating the mix tapes.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.393
"Yan Songs."

21:11.979 --> 21:13.897
AZIS: We all put in a lot of detail,

21:13.981 --> 21:18.318
and often it's a sort of lucky dip
whether you'll see those things or not.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.029
If you do see them, it's great,
and that pays off.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.865
But also for the actors
who are on the set,

21:23.949 --> 21:25.742
in between shots they're looking around.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.746
-Ah! She hasn't returned any of these.
-It's nice for their character as well.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.254
For this movie,

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
we went the way of LED volumes.

21:39.256 --> 21:42.259
The idea is to give the spacescapes
outside of the ships.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.804
This is so exciting.
I get to travel in space.

21:45.887 --> 21:49.057
We actually get to drift past a nebula
and jump through a wormhole

21:49.141 --> 21:51.643
in a way I never thought
we'd be able to do live on set.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.858
We used LEDs as a replacement
for a blue screen.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.320
With the LEDs you get an extension
of the environment outside the windows.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.571
(SHRIEKS) It's Nick Fury!

22:02.654 --> 22:04.906
SEAN BOBBITT: Often
we're shooting at blue screen studios,

22:04.990 --> 22:07.159
but the images are put in afterwards.

22:07.242 --> 22:10.746
Oh, Lord, it's a blue screen. That means
Teyonah has a list of questions.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.166
I don't want to get to the movie theater
and be like, "Wait a minute.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.501
"I didn't know
I was supposed to be reacting to that."

22:19.796 --> 22:21.798
Nia loves this set because it feels real.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.968
She can respond to things on the wall
and the characters can respond to things.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.346
The volume screens
are just the greatest thing.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.014
Everyone can actually see

22:29.097 --> 22:31.725
what you're supposed to see
and not just a green screen.

22:31.808 --> 22:33.060
So that's always...

22:33.143 --> 22:36.980
SEAN BOBBITT: We have live images moving
that the actors can then respond to,

22:37.064 --> 22:40.108
and we get interactive lighting
into the spaceship.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.528
All the materials
are very much metal and glass.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.782
The reflections and the colors
you're seeing through the screen,

22:46.865 --> 22:48.408
it's real and you believe it.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.954
You could slowly see it roll past

22:53.038 --> 22:56.583
over these amazing, nostalgic props
that are littered all over the set.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.382
The jump points
are the means of space travel.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.342
They're also quite bright wormholes

23:05.425 --> 23:07.636
that give you a view of the world
you're traveling to.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.012
To create these jump points,

23:09.096 --> 23:11.807
we worked quite closely
with the lighting department.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.602
They set up complementary lighting
around the ship for special events

23:15.685 --> 23:17.771
such as the jump points or the Bifrost.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.816
Because, of course, the brightness
of the LEDs sometimes was not enough.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.401
(EXCLAIMING)

23:23.944 --> 23:26.696
So as you come through, you get this
whole, like, immersive lighting

23:26.780 --> 23:29.366
coming from A to B, all the way
through to the back of the ship.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.661
It really makes people's eyes open and go,
"This stuff is really great."

23:32.744 --> 23:34.121
COMPUTER: Alpha Centauri system.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.705
BILLY BROOKS: With
all this new technology,

23:35.789 --> 23:38.041
there has to be somebody
to guide filmmakers.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.211
ILM Virtual Art Department
is a group of people

23:41.294 --> 23:44.756
that use real time software
to help answer questions basically.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.926
Working with their team
has been instrumental in our planning.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.430
They built this ship in 3D
and showed us how our content

23:51.513 --> 23:53.265
would play out alongside the scene.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.601
COLLINS: We had 2,400 LED screens.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.604
We could've done with a few more,
but there's never enough of anything.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.275
Having these visualizations
allowed us to decide, for instance,

24:03.358 --> 24:06.069
to strip some of the panels from the side
and put them at the front

24:06.153 --> 24:09.448
to compensate the fact
that we were lacking a bit of height.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.825
JACK BROWN: So we had to create
the front of the wall

24:11.908 --> 24:13.660
and the two left and right sections

24:13.743 --> 24:15.829
to be able to move up and down
on request.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.498
It allowed us to quickly adapt
to any of the needs of Sean.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.292
So even if we were shooting
a bit too high,

24:20.375 --> 24:22.794
because we don't have
an LED ceiling on here,

24:22.878 --> 24:25.839
we were able to simply move the wall up
into position within minutes.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.466
It's actually worked remarkably well.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.134
We have great coverage in this ship,

24:29.217 --> 24:31.845
and we're able to see the content
out of all of the windows.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.140
(BELL RINGS)

24:36.099 --> 24:38.768
Being able to be in a set
where you feel like

24:38.852 --> 24:41.354
you are actually in space
has been quite magical.

24:41.438 --> 24:45.108
We all, myself, Sean, Nia,
have sat in Carol's chair,

24:45.192 --> 24:47.360
come over a moon, and landed on Aladna.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.739
You actually feel like you're moving
through space in the craziest way,

24:50.822 --> 24:52.574
if you're not careful,
you might get dizzy.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.242
But it's been magical for all of us.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.161
The first time Kamala
went through a jump point,

24:56.244 --> 24:57.871
the actual wonder on her face.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.790
It's like being at an amusement park,
especially when we're doing scenes

25:00.874 --> 25:03.543
where they put a gimbal underneath
the ship to move the whole thing.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.379
DAVID WATKINS: We actually built
this gimbal on the stage.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.381
We've got a hydraulically controlled
motion base.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.010
Nia, very early on, she wanted to give
the cockpit a real shake,

25:12.093 --> 25:13.303
simulate fast travel...

25:14.888 --> 25:15.931
Change of direction.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.935
All in all,
a team of probably 40 guys and girls

25:20.018 --> 25:22.437
from conception
through to the operation on stage,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.606
a lot of steel and a lot of hard work.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.776
We've done other gimbals before,
but not one of this length.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.488
It was probably the toughest set
in terms of the scale of it.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.739
Ending up on a gimbal,

25:32.822 --> 25:35.075
it means the whole set
is at 10'6" in the air.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.327
At that height
with the amount of special effects,

25:37.410 --> 25:39.246
it had to be a solid steel structure.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.540
Typically, we might
make it out of scaffold.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.251
To see it all come together,
it's quite special.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.962
The filmmakers feel like
they still have this ownership,

25:47.045 --> 25:49.839
which they totally do.
And that's the goal for us here at ILM.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.758
We want to help tell these stories.

25:51.841 --> 25:55.303
This set has been amazing.
To have this wacky idea nearly a year ago

25:55.387 --> 25:57.764
that we'd be able to fly
in space for a few weeks,

25:57.847 --> 26:00.308
and then actually fly in space here,
it's been amazing.

-(ALADNEANS VOCALIZE)

26:18.618 --> 26:20.996
When I came into the film,
they wanted a musical number

26:21.079 --> 26:23.540
in the middle of the movie
and I was like, "That's crazy."

26:23.623 --> 26:25.041
Then I got really into the idea.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.459
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

26:28.086 --> 26:31.256
You want to live on Aladna.
It is stunning. Gorgeous.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.924
Everybody sings.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.928
It was my favorite place to develop
because it's really bright and hopeful.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.473
I feel like sci-fi usually is
very dark and down and grungy and sad.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.183
But this place is all about joy.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.228
It's been like my dream
to do a musical my whole life,

26:45.312 --> 26:49.065
so to get to do it on this scale
and this set is just super surreal.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.693
When I first signed up
to do a Marvel film,

26:51.776 --> 26:54.988
the last thing I expected to be doing
was a musical number.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.490
DaCOSTA: We had this amazing
choreographer, Shelley Maxwell,

26:57.574 --> 26:59.075
come in and choreograph the dances.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.952
MAXWELL: We're in the streets of Aladna

27:01.036 --> 27:02.954
and we're doing a welcoming
big opening number

27:03.038 --> 27:05.373
with lots of dancers and movement extras.

27:05.457 --> 27:10.295
We started off with 15 dancers doing R&D,
and then we graduated to 35,

27:10.378 --> 27:14.215
and now we have over 100 dancers
and movement extras in this space.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.635
Movement inspiration
came from just jubilation

27:16.718 --> 27:18.720
and the idea of being at a great party.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.723
Damn.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.983
She has this terrific song
and dance with Prince Yan.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.902
For me, when I read it, first thing was,

27:33.985 --> 27:36.071
it was a
Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers number.

-(SINGING) The Captain needs our help
-CROWD: Help!

27:43.328 --> 27:45.872
The first film really made me
push myself physically,

27:45.955 --> 27:47.791
learning how to be strong.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.209
This was actually the opposite.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.170
This was about learning how to move,
learning how to be more fluid...

27:52.253 --> 27:54.547
-What is she doing?
-(WHISPERS) Oh, she's respecting the flow.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.677
Be sensual. Things that I did not think
were gonna come with playing Carol at all.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.514
I just wanted Carol to have a moment
that isn't in a super suit,

28:02.597 --> 28:04.474
that she can be just purely feminine.

28:04.557 --> 28:07.477
But even when she's
in the most princess gown,

28:07.560 --> 28:10.021
it's still a sort of
Captain Marvel princess gown.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.066
How many chapters of your Captain Marvel
fan fiction is this giving you?

28:13.149 --> 28:14.150
KAMALA: So many.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.487
Aladna was just a feat of filmmaking.

28:17.570 --> 28:23.201
It really felt like we were on
a lyrical Mediterranean alien planet.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.121
Both the massive scale of it
and the attention to detail,

28:26.204 --> 28:28.873
it was really overwhelming and amazing.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.751
VELLANI: It's beautiful.
The set is awesome.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.129
These poor extras have been here
since 3:00 a.m.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.588
getting their alien makeup done.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.842
I just have so much appreciation
for all the work put into it.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.138
DAVID WHITE: How on earth
do you approach Aladna?

28:43.221 --> 28:44.723
It was massive in scale.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.268
We've had over maybe 68 life casts
of individual characters,

28:48.351 --> 28:52.313
full head and hand life casts,
gallons and gallons of silicon.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.649
The one thing about Aladna
is that their costumes

28:54.733 --> 28:58.570
are so outrageously cool color-wise,
and terrific shapes.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.948
Everything about the makeup is heightened,
but it still has to look believable.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.993
So the color tones,
you can use a bright pink,

29:05.076 --> 29:08.204
but it's got these beautiful,
complementary blues that run through it.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.289
All sorts of tones.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.833
And with the structure
of the makeup again,

29:11.916 --> 29:12.959
it's slightly more lavish.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.462
I had, like little wisps,
put on the ends of things

29:15.545 --> 29:18.506
and curls, all of these very
gregarious kind of shapes.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.008
But they worked beautifully.

29:22.552 --> 29:26.222
LINDSAY: Aladna is a planet of sea,
so their everything was very liquid,

29:26.306 --> 29:27.724
very soft, very flowing,

29:27.807 --> 29:30.560
and all of the colors
were from under the sea.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.688
So I took a lot of reference
from under the sea creatures,

29:33.772 --> 29:35.774
pastels and beautiful coral colors.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.401
Also, there are some
fabulous fashion designers

29:38.485 --> 29:41.571
that have that aesthetic in them,
namely Iris van Herpen.

29:41.654 --> 29:46.409
So I looked at a lot at her stuff because
she is as off-world as you can get.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.203
Because it was off-world,

29:48.286 --> 29:51.498
it's very little you can buy in the shop,
so we had to make it all.

29:51.581 --> 29:55.960
We had to dye it all, we had to print it,
cut it, everything was done from scratch.

29:56.044 --> 30:00.298
So the people that we have in this room,
which is a vast emporium in here,

30:00.381 --> 30:02.842
was full and buzzing
with people working really hard.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.096
WAKANA YOSHIHARA:
That was the most fun element,

30:07.180 --> 30:09.766
creating the Aladna citizens.

30:09.849 --> 30:14.813
I looked into lots of traditional
African art sculptures and tribes

30:14.896 --> 30:16.773
from the early 20th century,

30:16.856 --> 30:21.736
and I found lots of fascinating hairstyles
and how they shaped themselves.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.907
HELEN INGHAM: Aladna is the colorful bit,

30:25.990 --> 30:27.659
it's the happy bit in the movie.
(CHUCKLES)

30:27.742 --> 30:30.954
It's the girly bit if you're like,
"I'm not interested in the fights."

30:31.037 --> 30:32.872
We created costumes for dancers,

30:32.956 --> 30:35.208
so that was slightly different
for movement issues.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.961
Lindsay designed tops,
bottoms, jackets, coats,

30:38.044 --> 30:41.714
all sorts of things that we incorporated
into all the different looks at fitting.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.049
But it's not just Aladna.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.677
We've got other planets on the movie,
and that makes up...

30:45.760 --> 30:49.639
Gosh, it must be 1,000 to 1,200 costumes
and looks that we've created.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.727
Fun fact, Aladna is actually
the leading planet for fashion.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.856
Some of the best costumes
I've ever seen. Ever.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.816
-Stunning.
-DaCOSTA: It's really fun to add something

30:59.899 --> 31:01.484
that we've never seen before in the MCU.

31:01.568 --> 31:05.488
Just to kind of go full comic book madness
with our movie overall.

in a Korean drama during the pandemic.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.341
Absolutely loved him.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.886
I was like, "I think this guy
would be really good."

31:28.678 --> 31:32.098
Park is maybe the most famous person
I've ever worked with in my life.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.184

one night during filming,

31:40.231 --> 31:43.735
and it was quite a stir. (LAUGHS)

31:44.485 --> 31:47.530
He is amazing.
I got to stare into his eyes,

31:47.614 --> 31:50.575
be scene partners with him.
He just has so much charisma.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.995
People are gonna be very into Prince Yan.

31:56.331 --> 32:00.585
Yeah, Park was just supernatural.
He took to a sword so beautifully.

32:00.668 --> 32:03.379
Liang would show him
the choreography once, twice.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.964
-He watched.
-Yeah!

32:05.048 --> 32:08.676

and with great energy and grace.

We love battles and sword play.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.684
We're always in our element.

The more stunt people
we've got flying around,

32:25.902 --> 32:29.113
that have been teaching these stunts
over the past seven months.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.492
The energy that they give
for an entire shooting day,

32:32.575 --> 32:35.286
and then go learn more fighting
to teach you the next day,

32:35.370 --> 32:39.165
I mean, they're just such uplifting,
kind, gentle people.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.959
They do terrible things in the fight,

32:41.042 --> 32:44.212
but they're very kind (CHUCKLES)
when we're not on camera.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.883
We tried to bring different, unique styles
to the battle with the Aladnians.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.552
We wanted them
to move differently to the Kree.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.765
Aladnian people are much more peaceful,
much more graceful,

32:55.848 --> 32:58.267
much more fluid in their movement
and almost dance-like.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.229
So we wanted to incorporate that
in the battle movements

33:01.312 --> 33:04.524
so you could see the difference,
how they moved the different weapons

33:04.607 --> 33:05.775
as opposed to the Kree,

33:05.858 --> 33:08.444
more traditional
with the guns and the maces.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.904
The battle was great fun.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.659
It's crazy because we're just about
at the halfway mark,

33:14.742 --> 33:17.328
and it's the first time we're
all together in our super suits.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.290
So, we're dressed up as the Marvels.
So that's really exciting.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.961
LINDSAY: For the costumes,
the genesis of everything is the comics.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.421
And so we looked at those

33:26.504 --> 33:29.090
and looking at the way
the illustrations moved

33:29.173 --> 33:32.135
and how it informs you very much
of what the character is,

33:32.218 --> 33:34.762
so you can bring that into something
that then is made real.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.973
It's made 3D, it's made out of fabric.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.852
To start the research,
the designer and the design team

33:40.935 --> 33:42.895
look at what they want
to make it look like,

33:42.979 --> 33:44.689
down to buying the correct fabrics,

33:44.772 --> 33:47.483
testing the fabrics, the dyes, the colors,

33:47.567 --> 33:49.527
the fixtures, the zips, the poppers.

33:50.319 --> 33:53.281
We are doing things old-school,
by hand, sculpting by hand.

33:53.364 --> 33:56.117
We're also digitally sculpting,
we're 3D printing,

33:56.200 --> 33:58.995
laser cutting where everything
is drawn up in the computer.

33:59.078 --> 34:03.207
So we're here to make anything
that is prop-side of all the costumes,

34:03.291 --> 34:05.460
whether it is parts of
the Marvel super suits,

34:05.543 --> 34:09.839
done in rubber, to space helmets,
jewelry, all sorts of things.

34:10.465 --> 34:14.594
HORNSBY: We've had four big workshops,
around 170 crew.

34:14.677 --> 34:19.932
It's almost like a big retail park,
if you can imagine 300-square-foot units.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.685
You might have between
eight and 12 cutters

34:22.769 --> 34:24.437
with their teams working on the costumes,

34:24.520 --> 34:27.774
a team of 20-30 people
in the breakdown department,

34:28.232 --> 34:30.443
aging them, dyeing them, gluing them.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.945
A leather department
making the leather sculpting,

34:33.029 --> 34:35.615
costume effects department
making the armors.

34:35.698 --> 34:37.200
We've got some really talented people

34:37.283 --> 34:40.036
that achieved a lot
in a short space of time.

34:41.871 --> 34:45.249
LINDSAY: We all wanted
to find a female strength,

34:45.333 --> 34:49.921
to do this without it being sexualized,
with just being women.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.673
And I think that was
really important to all of us,

34:52.757 --> 34:56.886
that we have these strong characters
just going about their business

34:56.969 --> 35:03.142
without any sort of underlying
or sidelong sort of sexuality.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.895
It was just women being women
and being strong.

35:05.978 --> 35:09.273
Captain Marvel is pretty much invincible,
so she doesn't need armor.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.275
She doesn't need to have
anything to protect her

35:11.359 --> 35:12.944
'cause she does all that herself.

35:13.027 --> 35:16.197
Where we got to was to just have
something that she can work in,

35:16.280 --> 35:19.700
something that's comfortable,
that really shows her brand.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.203
Likewise with Monica,

35:22.787 --> 35:25.498
she's a character that's been around,
that people have seen.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.208
So it was a development of that.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.001
She is now black and white.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.337
That was where we wanted
to go with that one.

35:31.796 --> 35:35.341
Lindsay has been very open
to my thoughts and ideas

35:35.424 --> 35:38.261
and what I'm comfortable with,
what I haven't been comfortable with.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.763
So I'm really happy with the final look.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.767
Get the boots, get everything.
Yes. Thank you.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.564
LINDSAY: And then little Kamala,
she has a series.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.525
So we had that costume
which we carried on through this.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.068
And then she gets an upgrade.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.654
Could you get us something
a little more battle-ready?

35:56.737 --> 35:58.030
DIRECTOR: Action!

35:58.114 --> 36:00.324
You're literally working out
when you wear these suits,

36:00.408 --> 36:01.993
because there's, like, so much going on.

36:02.076 --> 36:06.789
But it's fine because I'm basically
getting jacked just wearing it.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.541
'Cause it's like a workout.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.751
Imagine wearing a dress
made out of resistance bands.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.171
And it's great for my shoulders,

36:13.254 --> 36:16.048
and my trainer says
I'm getting stronger from it.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.508
So that's all that matters.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.804
ASHTON: The outfits
have been such a pleasure.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.348
They've brought such an element
of transformation.

36:25.224 --> 36:29.520
Just running around in leather all day
and studs and these space boots,

36:29.604 --> 36:31.564
you know, it's made it feel so real.

36:32.481 --> 36:35.401
Dar-Benn has a brain for science
and a body for war.

36:35.484 --> 36:41.073
And so it had to be something
that was realistically intimidating

36:41.157 --> 36:42.950
and smart in a way,

36:43.034 --> 36:47.371
because we meet her at this new point
in her career as an emperor.

36:47.455 --> 36:51.209
But then she also does
a hell of a lot of fighting.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.212
It's one against three, you know.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.005
And so I had to be able to move

36:56.088 --> 36:59.008
and to really be believable
as a trained soldier.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.929
So there's a really lovely mixture
of emperor and soldier

37:03.012 --> 37:05.223
that I think Lindsay Pugh,
our costume designer,

37:05.306 --> 37:06.432
has done brilliantly.

37:06.891 --> 37:10.728
I feel so lucky to have had
the hair and makeup team

37:10.811 --> 37:12.605
that I've had on this film.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.233
Wakana Yoshihara,
who's done my hair,

37:15.316 --> 37:17.735
and Chantel McDonald
who's done my makeup

37:17.818 --> 37:19.195
have been my super heroes

37:19.278 --> 37:21.739
because the transformation
has been massive.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.115
(LAUGHS)

37:23.783 --> 37:26.494
It's such a bonkers journey,
but I love it.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.120
I love this look so much.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.833
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

37:38.881 --> 37:40.967
God, the action's great.
The action's so good.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.843
(LAUGHING) If I do say so myself.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.223
Oh, wow. This movie has a lot of action.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.810
My mom is texting me, "How's work today?"

37:50.893 --> 37:52.853
And I'm like,
"Oh, just fighting some aliens."

37:53.562 --> 37:54.563
That's what I do now.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.648
(GROANS)

37:56.732 --> 37:58.359
I mean, it's playtime.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.860
(SCREAMS)

38:02.196 --> 38:04.865
When we talked about action with Nia
in the very beginning,

38:04.949 --> 38:07.243
we want to feel everything we do is real.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.287
-MAN: Pull.
-(PARRIS EXCLAIMS)

38:09.370 --> 38:13.499
DaCOSTA: I really just wanted the action
to feel grounded enough...

38:16.585 --> 38:19.755
So that when things did go crazy
and people were fighting in the sky,

38:21.299 --> 38:23.050
you kind of just believed in everything.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.847
The action's just really special.

38:27.930 --> 38:31.225
One of the first things I talked about
with Jo McLaren, our stunt coordinator,

38:31.309 --> 38:34.937
and our second unit director Peng
was each character having their own style.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.107
We saw how it developed
throughout the film.

38:38.232 --> 38:40.484
Everybody is seeing
so many superhero movies.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.695
How we can make something interesting,

38:43.487 --> 38:44.488
fresh.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.907
That's my challenge.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.534
Now we have Ms. Marvel...

38:48.617 --> 38:49.618
Hi.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.287
We have Monica.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.373
They all have different super power.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.377
I can't fly.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.129
MALE KREE: Annihilator!

39:00.212 --> 39:02.465
In this movie,
you definitely see the powers

39:02.548 --> 39:03.924
they started with evolve.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.885
Ms. Marvel, she's just gotten her powers.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.971
At first it can be a little bit random.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.432
It was a little more clunky,
and not as elegant.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.604
She can create orbs and things
and traps Kree inside those.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.023
(WARBLING)

39:19.982 --> 39:21.692
We definitely see that evolve at the end.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.696
She uses the hard light to completely
her advantage and for teamwork.

39:25.821 --> 39:26.822
(MS. MARVEL GRUNTING)

39:28.908 --> 39:32.453
And then there's Monica Rambeau
who has not used her powers at all,

39:32.536 --> 39:33.621
except for science.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.206
She has to learn how to fight.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.374
(GRUNTS)

39:36.457 --> 39:38.084
She has to know how to fly,
all this stuff.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.379
We first see her begin to fly
outside the Khans' house.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.797
You gotta fly.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.886
She needs to go and believe
that she can go up and help save Kamala.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.223
She gets better
and more confident as we go.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.771
For Teyonah, it was really important
to track, that she's figuring things out.

39:58.854 --> 40:01.107
So a lot of,
"Is this is my first time doing this?"

40:01.190 --> 40:03.067
"Yeah, this is your first time flying."

40:03.692 --> 40:07.321
Or, "It's not your first time doing that,
but your first time doing it offensively.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.740
"It's your first time
hitting someone with it."

40:11.409 --> 40:14.245
And then with Captain Marvel,
she's been doing this for 30 years.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.456
She can be a little bit sloppy
because she's not as focused.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.793
Maybe she takes
certain things for granted,

40:20.876 --> 40:23.003
and we see how that shifts
throughout the film.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.088
Come on.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.381
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

40:25.881 --> 40:29.718
A lot of time, it's Captain Marvel
against maybe 20, 30 Kree.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.637
She is the most powerful.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.848
Three, two, one. Action!

40:34.473 --> 40:35.933
We have to show
that sense of power.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.686
And we do that with
one of the best wire teams...

40:40.020 --> 40:41.021
in the world.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.315
Daryl Andrews, Joe Spilhaus.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.777
Incredibly hardworking team.

40:47.820 --> 40:48.821
LARSON: That's fun.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.614
I can see all the trailers.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.075
This is a very wire-intensive movie.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.244
We have wires pretty much every day.

40:55.327 --> 40:58.664
We see Kree and Dar-Benn getting
flung here, there and everywhere.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.458
And when you see those sequences,

41:00.541 --> 41:03.502
all of those moments
are meticulously worked out.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.504
We look at the physics, we do bag tests,

41:05.588 --> 41:08.257
we rehearse with lots of pads,
lots of thick mats.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.301
And then eventually,
when things get dialed in,

41:10.384 --> 41:12.845
then we'll go to soft set,
we'll go to thinner mats.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.264
Obviously, we want to protect
our stunt performers.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.266
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

and Monica Rambeau fight,

41:44.001 --> 41:46.003
but also how does the Khan family fight.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.671
How does Mrs. Khan and Mr. Khan,

41:47.755 --> 41:49.924

against these aliens?

41:56.805 --> 41:59.308
Obviously, this movie
has a lot of visual effects.

41:59.391 --> 42:02.228
Almost every shot,
you have a visual effects element,

42:02.311 --> 42:05.272
but we wanted physical to do it,
practical to do it.

This is Carol, jump off,

42:16.116 --> 42:20.746
With people that small, we still decided
to use a stunt double to drop.

42:20.829 --> 42:23.874
This is about 40 feet
to do the real action.

42:24.500 --> 42:28.128
The visual effects will help to build up
the speed, build up the environment,

42:28.212 --> 42:29.838
but obviously the stunt is real.

42:31.423 --> 42:35.678
Even when they're flying, we put them on
all the different rigs, winches,

42:36.929 --> 42:38.055

I always found it funny when all three,
Iman, Teyonah and Brie

42:45.104 --> 42:46.188
would all be on wires.

So this is, like, my ideal job.

43:09.336 --> 43:11.547
Seeing different reactions
to that was funny.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.632
I'm having the time of my life. (CHUCKLES)

43:13.716 --> 43:16.427
I know Teyonah sometimes
finds it a little difficult.

43:18.971 --> 43:22.391
And she just sees me spinning around
on the tuning fork and everything,

43:22.474 --> 43:24.768
and I'm like having the time of my life.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.272
This is great. (LAUGHING)

43:29.231 --> 43:31.442
I come to work and I just play around.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.277
It's like bungee jumping every day.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.820
Oh, it's great. It's a dream.

43:34.903 --> 43:36.196
DIRECTOR: Action.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.451
This is where all the training
actually comes in,

43:40.534 --> 43:42.244
where you're being hung on a wire

43:42.328 --> 43:44.747
by, like, your shoulder point
and your thighs.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.540
You just got to hold your core like crazy.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.709
You're working out all day. It's insane.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.377
But this is the superhero stuff.

43:50.919 --> 43:53.380
It's dorky, and as weird as it looks,

43:53.464 --> 43:56.550
when we're all bald and have,
like, weird alien spikes on our head

43:56.634 --> 43:58.677
and dots on our face, it's like...

43:58.761 --> 43:59.803
It's weird.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.014
But you still feel like a superhero.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.267
LARSON: The preparation is intense.

44:05.351 --> 44:07.186
For the first film,
I trained for nine months,

44:07.269 --> 44:09.521
the second film,
probably about four months.

44:09.605 --> 44:15.653
I was able to do a one-arm pull-up
and one-arm push-ups. Ten on both arms.

44:15.736 --> 44:19.448
And it's all about just getting my body
completely limber and strong

44:19.531 --> 44:20.783
and ready for whatever.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.620
PARRIS: When I first got here,

44:24.703 --> 44:27.247
I had a couple of weeks with Maria,
my stunt double,

44:27.331 --> 44:28.957
just really trying to learn some basics.

44:29.041 --> 44:32.419
They've just been so helpful,
so patient, so encouraging.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.213
Also just really badass, as you can see.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.965
So I'm like, "I'm gonna tap you in.
You go. You do it.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.927
"Please make me look great.
I'll do what I can." It's been wonderful.

44:40.636 --> 44:43.013
ASHTON: I can't talk about
the stunt team without crying,

44:43.097 --> 44:45.140
so I'm going to try this one time.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.059
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

44:48.519 --> 44:53.982
I had no idea how key the stunt team is
to a film like this.

44:57.236 --> 45:00.030
That might sound naive,
but they are the beating heart.

45:03.075 --> 45:06.620
Like in a musical, when you sing,
that's your level of communication.

45:06.704 --> 45:10.165
Combat is the communication
of these films.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.168
When I first went into my stunt session,

45:13.252 --> 45:17.423
I worried about my level
of strength and coordination.

45:18.590 --> 45:22.678
But I needn't have worried
because the stunt team are the kindest,

45:22.761 --> 45:24.847
most hardworking people you could meet.

45:27.599 --> 45:30.144
I've just been talking about all you guys.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.187
LISTER: Oh, no. It's not true. I promise.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.773
ASHTON: These are the amazing team
that I've been talking about.

45:34.857 --> 45:38.318
Andy Lister, Liang, Snow,
Rashid Phoenix.

45:38.402 --> 45:41.113
That's Maria and Jess and Snow.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.491
My stunt double's one of
the greatest people ever. (CHUCKLES)

45:44.867 --> 45:47.786
-As you can see, Rashid is a male.
-(LAUGHS)

45:47.870 --> 45:51.331
Yes, so Zawe is a lovely,
lovely tall lady.

45:52.875 --> 45:57.379
We're a little bit short on 5'11" ladies
over here in the UK.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.840
So come on, girls,
get training for the stunt register.

45:59.923 --> 46:05.137
He's had to throw himself into wearing
a lot of padding in all the right places.

46:05.888 --> 46:10.142
He's a tall, slender gentleman with legs
most women would absolutely kill for.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.854
Zawe had that situation before,

46:13.937 --> 46:16.523
and was more than happy
and absolutely loves Rash.

46:16.607 --> 46:20.319
And then we have the lovely Chloe
who is a beautiful mover as well,

46:20.402 --> 46:22.279
but can't be in two places at once.

46:22.362 --> 46:25.449
He makes me look so good.
And you wear the hair well.

46:26.366 --> 46:27.743
Thank you. (LAUGHS)

46:27.826 --> 46:30.204
(CHUCKLING) Sometimes it's styled
a bit better than mine.

46:30.287 --> 46:32.372
-I get annoyed about that.
-Don't talk about that.

46:36.168 --> 46:40.172
The wonderful thing about working
in visual effects for Marvel Studios,

46:41.131 --> 46:45.636
they allow us to capture all of the
reference we would ever need every time.

46:49.723 --> 46:51.600
Are there cats? (GASPS)

46:53.602 --> 46:54.937
(MEOWS)

46:57.606 --> 47:00.859
-Nia really cared about cats.
-(MEOWS)

47:00.943 --> 47:04.196
DeMARCO: We brought real cats
into pretty much every scene.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.572
DaCOSTA: It was so cute.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.076
Even the grumpiest crew members
would be like, "Where are the cats?"

47:10.452 --> 47:14.331
DeMARCO: The interesting challenge
with recreating a house cat

47:14.414 --> 47:17.376
is that many, many people have house cats,

47:17.459 --> 47:19.461
and they know what they look like.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.296
You might have one
that sleeps next to you.

47:21.922 --> 47:24.883
We wanted to be as accurate as possible.

47:24.967 --> 47:29.429
So we actually did a super complicated
cat scan... (IMITATES DRUM ROLL)

47:29.513 --> 47:31.849
...to create the best possible CG cat.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.352
JO VAUGHN: We have two Geese on this.

47:35.435 --> 47:39.481
This is Nemo, who is one of them.
The lead cat is called Tango.

47:39.565 --> 47:42.359
We have two because they're both good
at very different things.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.486
Nemo, he's a bit more of a stunt cat.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.572
He likes to do all the running,
the jumping.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.031
Tango is much steadier.

47:48.115 --> 47:51.618
He does all of the sitting, staying,
the eyelines, the quirky looks.

47:51.702 --> 47:52.786
They're a good team.

47:53.161 --> 47:54.162
(BELL RINGS)

47:55.330 --> 47:57.916
Tango and Nemo,
they're really just a nightmare.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.335
-(BOTH LAUGHING)
-I'm kidding.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.671
They're just the biggest divas
on this set.

48:02.754 --> 48:05.674
At one point, to Nia I was like,
"It's me or them."

48:05.757 --> 48:08.135
-And Nia made her choice. (LAUGHS)
-KARASIK: Yeah.

48:08.218 --> 48:10.345
And that was the last day
I worked on The Marvels.

48:10.429 --> 48:11.513
DIRECTOR: Action.

48:12.222 --> 48:13.223
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

48:13.307 --> 48:16.351
DaCOSTA: I'll give these back
so people think I'm actually working.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.856
LIVANOS: Kitten days were exhilarating,
truly the best thing ever.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.566
Also, incredibly stressful.

48:24.651 --> 48:27.237
They were tiny and sweet
and terrifyingly unpredictable.

48:27.654 --> 48:28.739
(PURRS)

48:28.906 --> 48:31.408
LIVANOS: The entire crew became cat moms.

48:31.491 --> 48:33.869
Everyone was liable to herd cats

48:33.952 --> 48:35.621
if ever they ran off
in the wrong direction.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.122
So, we're literally herding cats?

48:37.956 --> 48:41.251
It basically became the scene
of the movie that we were shooting.

48:41.335 --> 48:45.380
DeMARCO: Just like with Goose, we often
would film our kittens as a reference.

48:45.464 --> 48:49.176
But kittens aren't as well-trained
as our hero Goose was.

48:49.259 --> 48:52.095
So almost every kitten
in the movie is a CG kitten.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.180
(MEOWS)

48:53.263 --> 48:56.433
But there are a handful of shots
where they were too cute to pass up,

48:56.516 --> 48:59.186
and I'll let you decide
which ones they were.

48:59.853 --> 49:02.064
LARSON: When your director's
giving you notes

49:02.147 --> 49:04.399
and like everyone's got a kitten,
that's a great day.

49:04.483 --> 49:05.984
When you're on an 85-day shoot,

49:06.068 --> 49:08.236
you should have some days
where kittens are there.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.365
I do like cats.

49:11.823 --> 49:13.241
(CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING)

49:16.495 --> 49:21.375
KARASIK: The gift and challenge of this
movie is that you're not only answering

49:21.458 --> 49:24.878
to the widening MCU
and multiple backstories,

49:24.962 --> 49:26.672
but you're doing that times three.

49:27.756 --> 49:30.258
Something that I've always loved
about MCU as a fan

49:30.342 --> 49:33.261
is how it blends so many genres at once.

49:33.345 --> 49:37.641
And oftentimes the tone of a movie
will follow from the character.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.018
When you have three characters like this,

49:40.102 --> 49:43.146
it actually gives you a lot to play with.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.359
KARPMAN: We're here today
at Abbey Road Studios

49:48.610 --> 49:50.904
recording the score for The Marvels.

49:52.656 --> 49:53.907
(PLAYING VIOLIN)

49:56.159 --> 49:58.328
KARPMAN: I feel privileged
beyond belief to be here.

49:59.121 --> 50:02.791
It sounds amazing. The room is amazing.
The musicians are amazing.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.919
To have this kind of orchestra,

50:06.003 --> 50:09.840
and this combination of 90 players
out there who are all phenomenal,

50:09.923 --> 50:12.926
to be able to express
my musical thoughts is a privilege.

50:14.970 --> 50:18.015
Laura Karpman came to us from What If...?,

50:18.098 --> 50:21.768
taking many different heroes
from all across the Marvel universe

50:21.852 --> 50:26.857
and finding each of their own
signature sounds and themes

50:26.940 --> 50:28.275
and bringing them together.

50:28.358 --> 50:33.113
What If...? was a great place to train
for doing Ms. Marvel and The Marvels.

50:35.991 --> 50:40.787
You've got our three protagonists,
all who've appeared in other shows, right?

50:40.871 --> 50:42.789
Ms. Marvel, WandaVision,

50:42.873 --> 50:44.583
and, of course, Captain Marvel.

50:45.625 --> 50:50.547
So we had to have a new superhero theme
that was the theme for the three of them.

50:50.630 --> 50:52.507
Like, a team theme.

50:52.591 --> 50:54.176
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

50:56.595 --> 50:58.805
Laura did an amazing job
coming up with a theme

50:58.889 --> 51:00.766
that we all hum around the office.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.100
So good. (LAUGHS)

51:02.184 --> 51:05.812
Sometimes I'll turn it on just to dance
to it (LAUGHING) in my office.

51:08.857 --> 51:10.692
KARPMAN: I think it's a fabulous theme.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.986
Am I allowed to say that?
I think it's great.

51:13.987 --> 51:17.616
Twelve French horns, Marvel theme,
upbeat, you know, super fun.

51:20.243 --> 51:21.453
(ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)

51:25.165 --> 51:28.251
Also, quite noteworthy
is our theme for Dar-Benn.

51:29.419 --> 51:34.257
For her sound, I used seven flutes,
including a contrabass flute.

51:35.342 --> 51:39.638
So, it's this wicked, low, slithery sound.

51:40.472 --> 51:42.432
That, to me, is Dar-Benn.

51:45.977 --> 51:49.106
The flute theme you'll hear,
there's bit of jazz in there, I gotta say.

51:51.108 --> 51:54.319
'Cause Dar-Benn's kind of jazzy
in her own way, right?

51:54.402 --> 51:55.779
She's got a vibe.

51:55.862 --> 51:59.116
She's got an attitude
which struck me as smoky.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.413
Nia had a lot of input.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.959
She came to every session.
She was really there. She participated.

52:09.042 --> 52:11.586
-See all the strings doing that.
-DaCOSTA: Mmm-hmm.

52:11.670 --> 52:14.923
KARPMAN: We did some really cool
improvisations with the orchestra as well.

52:15.006 --> 52:18.885
I call it the wall of sound, where I took
all of the elements of Dar-Benn's theme

52:18.969 --> 52:22.097
and cued everyone in the orchestra
to play them simultaneously.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.808
So what it is, is it's structured chaos.

52:24.891 --> 52:26.268
She was super hip to that,

52:26.351 --> 52:28.562
and loved all that
kind of experimentation.

KARPMAN: The week
that we spent at Abbey Road was

53:06.892 --> 53:08.643
really one of the best weeks of my life.

53:08.727 --> 53:13.440
There was a sense of camaraderie.
We had all-female first chair players,

53:13.523 --> 53:15.275
and I insisted on a diverse orchestra.

53:15.358 --> 53:18.695
So we saw a lot of different faces
in the orchestra, so that was great.

53:18.778 --> 53:24.201
I feel so fortunate to be appreciated
in this world because I love it so much.

This is not us going to, like, work
and then we clock out. This is our life.

53:55.565 --> 53:57.776
So there was just this childlike play.

53:57.859 --> 54:01.029
We're able to rib each other because
we have so much love for one another.

54:03.365 --> 54:06.201
Some really funny things that happened
will not sound funny at all,

54:06.284 --> 54:08.578
'cause it's like,
"Someone went up on a wire weird."

54:08.662 --> 54:12.374
And we could not stop laughing
for the longest time.

It was so much fun. It was so great.

before I hand over to Nia.

54:32.352 --> 54:34.813
I want to say to Nia from all of us,

54:34.896 --> 54:39.150
I think, will join me in saying, the most
fantastic leader we could have had

for the last 17 weeks
and all the prep,

when I got it last summer.

LIVANOS: The set was a really
wonderful place to be.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.593
The crew really became a family.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.972
It's truly been a passion project
for each and every one of us.

55:09.889 --> 55:14.978
Nia, our director, and Mary, our producer,
fostered the best on-set environment.

55:15.061 --> 55:20.442
It was really fulfilling to work with
such an integrated collaborative group.

55:20.525 --> 55:21.568
LIVANOS: Amazing, guys.

55:21.651 --> 55:23.528
The most rewarding part
of this whole production

55:23.611 --> 55:26.781
is the collaboration with the cast,
with the crew.

55:26.865 --> 55:27.949
Thank you so much.

55:28.742 --> 55:32.704
It is an extraordinary privilege
to work with such talented people.

55:33.788 --> 55:38.335
LARSON: Hair, makeup, wardrobe,
choreography, everything.

55:38.418 --> 55:39.544
It went to the next level.

55:41.004 --> 55:44.424
VELLANI: This movie's gonna inspire
a lot of people, and I'm very excited.

55:44.507 --> 55:47.635
I think it's very different
than everything we have in the MCU so far,

55:47.719 --> 55:50.180
and, you know, it's so rare
where you get to see

55:50.263 --> 55:54.309
this many badass people of color
and women at the forefront

55:54.392 --> 55:57.312
of a movie on a scale this huge.

(DEBRIS CRUMBLING)

56:07.197 --> 56:11.117
KARASIK: This movie is a tone-setter,
I think, for the MCU going forward,

56:11.201 --> 56:13.370
in terms of how it does bring

56:13.453 --> 56:16.873
disparate characters together
across space and time,

56:16.956 --> 56:20.502
how that can really escalate
or upgrade the storytelling.

56:20.585 --> 56:24.798
There's more of a cosmic community,
whether or not the characters know that.

56:26.174 --> 56:28.385
"What you seek is seeking you."

56:28.468 --> 56:29.761
Okay.

(SIGHS) Today is my wrap day.

56:32.972 --> 56:34.599
Very bittersweet about it.

56:34.682 --> 56:36.851
Haven't really processed anything.

56:36.935 --> 56:40.063
This job has been so incredibly wonderful.

Thank you, everyone.

56:52.575 --> 56:55.203
Thank you so much.
Thank you for being here.

56:55.286 --> 56:59.749
Thank you for being away from your
families and your friends and your pets

56:59.833 --> 57:01.126

57:01.209 --> 57:03.628
Thank you for dedicating
so much time to this.

(SOFTLY) Thank you so much.

57:16.933 --> 57:18.726
Where this film ends,

57:19.477 --> 57:23.064
there's a big question mark there
of what that means for Carol.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.067
There's a lot in her heart
that is settled.

57:26.151 --> 57:28.027
There's a lot in my heart
that feels settled.

57:29.112 --> 57:33.408
Every other character, when it's over,
I'm like, "Get it off."

57:33.491 --> 57:35.952
And this is the one that I've been like,

57:36.035 --> 57:38.663
"I think I'm gonna keep this on
a little bit longer."

57:38.746 --> 57:44.752
And I've seen how this star, this symbol
has meant so much to so many people.

57:44.836 --> 57:48.298
I would love to carry on that tradition
of being able to be part of it.

57:49.132 --> 57:52.969
And also I understand
that it's not all mine, you know?

57:53.052 --> 57:56.764
Anybody can take that mantle.
And I also feel at peace with the fact

57:56.848 --> 57:58.933
that we've got this new school coming in.

57:59.017 --> 58:00.351
I was born for this.

58:00.435 --> 58:03.813
LARSON: There's new faces,
new superheroes coming in,

58:03.897 --> 58:06.191
and so I don't know
where Carol's place is.

58:06.858 --> 58:09.152
And I feel like I can rest
in the fact that, like,

58:09.235 --> 58:10.820
we've got some amazing people

58:10.904 --> 58:13.072
that are going to help
take care of this universe.

58:13.823 --> 58:15.450
Higher, further, faster.

58:15.533 --> 58:16.993
Higher, further, faster.
