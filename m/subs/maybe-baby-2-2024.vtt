WHEN YOU TURN YOUR BACK FOR 2 SECONDS
#SPELTBABY

00:19.600 --> 00:21.000
Leo, you rascal.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.240
WHEN MOM IS THE KID!

00:24.320 --> 00:25.400
-Isn't it nice?
-Having fun?

00:25.480 --> 00:27.920
We're great,
but she doesn't want to play with me.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.120
Don't you want to paint, sweetheart?

00:30.640 --> 00:31.560
Don't you?

00:35.360 --> 00:36.280
Wave to Mom.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.960
Wave to Mom.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.920
-Look, sweetie.
-Oh, no…

00:43.000 --> 00:46.120
DAD APPARENTLY LIKES MUD THE MOST…
#NICEGIRL

00:46.200 --> 00:47.400
Will you look at that?

00:48.720 --> 00:52.560
MAYBE BABY 2

01:13.120 --> 01:15.440
Leo!

01:16.520 --> 01:20.120
Leo, come here,
or you're not getting any birthday cake.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.840
Leo, I'm not saying it again! Come here!

01:22.920 --> 01:25.440
Honey, you shouldn't threaten
children with punishment.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.040
All the parenting books say so.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.720
Don't you start, Andreas--

01:36.640 --> 01:37.480
Sorry.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.080
-No…
-No!

01:42.760 --> 01:44.160
Oh, Leo!

01:44.680 --> 01:46.480
-Oh, Leo!
-You've got that one.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Leo…

02:07.320 --> 02:09.800
Dad… A pair.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.320
-A pair.
-How on earth do you keep winning?

02:19.400 --> 02:23.600
Honey, don't let her win every time.
She should learn how to handle defeat.

02:23.680 --> 02:28.200
What? But I'm not letting her.
It's just that she… Yes.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.120
-What?
-You guys are just cute together.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.680
I win.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.520
A pair.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.120
-Damn it, Sille. You keep winning.
-Fine.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.680
-Two.
-What?

02:43.440 --> 02:44.960
Did Dad curse twice?

02:45.600 --> 02:46.480
Bad dad.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.080
I'm going to eat you.
Yes, I'm going to eat you.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.840
…from one hand. And when you reach
the hole, you grab some herring brine--

02:58.920 --> 03:03.320
Lars, that's not an appropriate topic
for a children's birthday party!

03:03.400 --> 03:06.560
Right! The buns are ready.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.120
Delicious!

03:08.200 --> 03:09.840
-Wow…
-You should have said so.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.440
If you didn't have time to bake,
I could have helped you.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.360
Those are the best tea buns
from the bakery, my favorite.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.680
-So I asked for them.
-You know what?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.840
It's so nice to see you again.
It's been too long.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.880
You too, Liv.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.160
Yeah?

03:29.760 --> 03:31.960
-No, Leo.
-Has it been a rough week?

03:32.040 --> 03:35.680
Yes, Dad. I've changed his clothes
three times today and bathed him twice.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.240
Soon it will be a third time.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.880
It can be demanding
raising a wonderful rascal of a child.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.680
I should know.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.560
Right. Now it's time!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.200
Will you look at that?

03:52.840 --> 03:55.640
And who's the one turning two today?

03:55.720 --> 03:57.720
-Me.
-Me.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.160
-Would you like this one?
-Yes.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.120
There you go, honey.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.000
-And a gift for you, Sille.
-Thank you very much.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.240
She's got great language skills
for a two-year-old.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.200
-Wow!
-How cool!

04:13.280 --> 04:14.880
-It's so cool.
-Really cool.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.480
-Wow…
-So pretty.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.560
-I want to wear it.
-Right now?

04:24.640 --> 04:27.760
Yes. Let her try it on.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.360
Wow.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.880
-Pretty.
-Are you a princess?

04:31.960 --> 04:34.000
It's so pretty, honey.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.560
Do you want to see what I have for you?
I made it myself.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.240
There you go, Leo.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.040
-Have a look.
-Me look.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.960
-Wow!
-What is it?

04:46.080 --> 04:49.680
-Leo, really!
-You should say thank you for the nice…

04:50.480 --> 04:51.520
Shorts?

04:52.400 --> 04:54.880
-They're beautiful, Liv.
-It's alpaca wool.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.040
Me jump.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.800
-Is he all right?
-What happened?

05:02.880 --> 05:05.160
Oh, sweetheart. Come here.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.560
Dad!

05:09.560 --> 05:13.280
-Sweetie, did you hurt yourself?
-Right. Always Dad.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.840
It was quite a leap too. Let me see.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.400
-Need help with the dishes?
-That would be great.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.320
Yes.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.320
Has Leo had his biannual checkup yet?

05:34.720 --> 05:37.400
-No. It's on the to-do list.
-Sille's went great.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.760
She's perfectly healthy.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.080
The doctor said
she's hyper-intelligent or highly gifted.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.760
-Wow.
-Yeah.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.960
How wonderful!

05:50.320 --> 05:51.480
Christ…

05:53.880 --> 05:56.920
Have you heard
that Cecilie is going to be made partner?

05:57.000 --> 06:01.440
-Really? Congratulations.
-Well, it's not all settled yet.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.840
So we've been super busy at home lately.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.320
Really? That doesn't sound very healthy.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.960
Not too busy, okay?

06:09.040 --> 06:12.160
It's not like I'm bleeding
from my ears. I'm fine.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.080
Of course.
It's great that you love what you do.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.680
It makes you happier at home, right?

06:19.800 --> 06:20.640
Right.

06:23.320 --> 06:28.720
And then they lived in here
when they grew up. What do we call this?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.160
It's called a house.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.840
And where's the thing you enter through?

06:35.920 --> 06:38.560
If you're entering a house, you use a…

06:38.640 --> 06:41.560
House. A house.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.480
-No, that's not a house. That's a door.
-Honey?

06:45.720 --> 06:47.880
It's late. Don't you think
I should give it a try?

06:47.960 --> 06:50.240
Right. Good night, sweetie.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.680
-You little firecracker. Time to sleep.
-No, no, no.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.360
-Here. Lie down now.
-No!

06:57.440 --> 06:59.000
-Leo, lie down.
-Not Mom.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.000
Yes, that's just the way it is.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.920
-Dad!
-Leo, lie down.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.960
No, lie down. Leo, it's late.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.920
You need to sleep.
We have to get up early, Leo.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.640
You have to go to sleep now. Sleep.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.600
-Christ…
-A success?

07:20.120 --> 07:24.320
Two hours, 23 minutes, and 17 seconds.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.760
Twelve seconds faster than me yesterday.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.960
I don't get it.
How did he turn out so wild? I mean…

07:33.880 --> 07:36.280
-Perhaps Malte has a point.
-With what?

07:36.360 --> 07:39.720
That you're too busy.
Your stress rubs off on Leo.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.080
What can I do? Coming back
after maternity leave was hard.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.200
Breaking into that boys' club.
I'm this close at becoming a partner.

07:46.880 --> 07:51.560
-Perhaps we could get an au pair.
-No. We're not getting an au pair.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.600
I called my au pair "mom"
for most of my childhood.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.520
Leo's not doing that.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.600
All right. I'm booking
his biannual checkup for Wednesday.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.560
Right.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.000
-The parent-teacher meeting's on Thursday.
-This Thursday?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.320
I already told you.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.800
He doesn't have a transitional jacket.
He needs a haircut.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.120
And sign him up for swimming
before the 1st or he won't get a spot.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.440
I'm sure we'll manage it all in time.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.200
-Do you know what you need?
-I need to sleep.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.160
I think you need to relax.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.760
No, honey.
I don't have the energy for that.

08:21.120 --> 08:21.960
No…

08:33.040 --> 08:36.200
-You can pick her up today, right?
-Don't you think it's your turn?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.840
Right, but I'm in high demand right now.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.040
The phone is ringing
off the hook with clients.

08:46.000 --> 08:46.920
Thanks, honey.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.440
But remember,
you're in high demand here too.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.760
Things were so chaotic
at Cecilie and Andreas's place.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.360
But no wonder
with that dynamo of a kid they have.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.440
-What? He's cute.
-Sure, he's great.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.800
I'm more worried about Cecilie.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.040
She's not connecting
with her role as a mother.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.960
Oops. Honey, I'm off.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.400
Remember to use positive words with Sille.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.760
Negative words affect her language.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.760
-And don't forget to shop for dinner.
-Was that a question?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.040
-See you tonight.
-Tonight?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.880
-Late afternoon, okay?
-But…

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
See you, honey. Bye.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.960
See you. Bye-bye.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.800
-Bye.
-Love you guys.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.200
What do you say?

09:40.280 --> 09:42.720
You want to listen to death metal
and trash the place?

09:44.280 --> 09:45.120
No.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.880
Thank you, Liv. That was great.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.840
You're welcome, Thomas.
I'm glad we got you loosened up.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.680
It should help with your migraine.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.600
-I hope so. See you.
-See you in a week. Bye.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.720
Pumpkin, there's been a mistake.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.320
It says you have a client
at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.840
-Yes.
-Wednesday is my dinner day.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.360
-We always hang out, the whole family.
-Right--

10:08.440 --> 10:11.360
It's not good for Sille
for you to work so much.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.400
-Especially since Malte always--
-Tulip.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.760
Tulip, Mom.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.200
-I didn't say anything negative.
-You were about to.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.840
Hi, Liv.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.200
Hi, Jakob. Lovely to see you.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.320
You too. And I really need treatment
before the cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.760
Oh boy. Shall we go have a look at you?

10:28.840 --> 10:30.200
-Yes.
-Great.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.960
Right. She should be here any minute.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.160
Sorry.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.640
Hi, sweetie.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.600
-Right.
-Sorry.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.440
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.800
-All right, I'm ready.
-Yes. And we are actually done.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.680
-Yes.
-Okay.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.680
And what's the result regarding…

10:59.720 --> 11:01.160
-Oh, intelligence.
-Yes.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.520
-Intelligence?
-Yes. Is he outside the normal spectrum?

11:08.720 --> 11:11.080
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.240
It's just that we…
we've been wondering whether…

11:16.160 --> 11:18.480
-If something might be wrong.
-How so?

11:18.560 --> 11:22.840
Well, he's got an energy level that's…
He's all over the place all the time.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.000
So…

11:25.800 --> 11:29.240
-Perhaps not right now--
-I haven't noticed anything.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.880
Leo's behavior is well within the norm.
Kids vary in their activity levels.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.280
He doesn't sleep at night.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.840
I'm up seven to twelve times a night.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.320
We thought that perhaps we could

11:43.000 --> 11:45.320
get something that would help him.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.200
Are you suggesting
I prescribe sleeping pills to a child?

11:48.280 --> 11:50.280
No, I would never suggest that.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.240
Not actual sleeping pills.
I'm talking sleeping pills for children.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.920
Or just melatonin. Melatonin for children.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.480
Right. Perhaps we could just start
by doing a blood test?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.920
To rule out ADHD.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.640
Psychiatric disorders
don't show up in blood tests.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.400
Then perhaps it's something else.
He bruises quite easily.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.720
-Perhaps it's his blood sugar.
-I doubt it.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.640
You doubt it, but you don't know.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.560
It could be anemia.
It could be meningitis.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.680
It could be scarlet fever,
rubella, scurvy.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.360
All right. I'll do a skin prick test.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.560
Hopefully that'll alleviate your concerns.

12:24.320 --> 12:28.280
That would alleviate my… our concerns.
Thanks, I have to get this.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.480
-Right now, Cecilie?
-I'll be right back.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.240
-Hi, Max.
-Hi, Cecilie.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.040
-You didn't accept the meeting invitation.
-I'm at the doctor's right now.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.360
You're not pregnant again, are you?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.240
No, Max. I'm not.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.320
That would practically defy nature by now.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.680
-Anything else?
-No.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.640
I just wanted to say
it's tomorrow at 7:30 a.m.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.960
If that's too early,
I can just take the lead

12:56.040 --> 12:57.560
and brief you afterward.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.520
No, 7:30 a.m. is perfect.
I'll see you then, okay?

13:02.040 --> 13:02.880
Bye.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.720
Christ…

13:07.640 --> 13:11.600
Right… There, swipe. It's on silent mode.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.600
What's wrong? Oh no, he's sick.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.920
What is it? Does he have hepatitis?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.080
Malaria? Not the mumps, is it?

13:22.160 --> 13:24.800
Andreas and I were just talking about

13:24.880 --> 13:28.680
how odd it is that Leo has blood type 0.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.800
-Why? Is that dangerous?
-No.

13:30.880 --> 13:36.920
But it requires that both parents
pass on the blood type 0 genes.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.320
-And Andreas is telling me…
-What are you telling him?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.840
What's going on? What's wrong?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.640
-Hi.
-Please have a seat.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.680
So…

13:52.480 --> 13:55.240
-Here we are again, right?
-Yes.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.560
And we'd very much like
an explanation for all of this.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.120
-An explanation for what?
-I'll let the two gentlemen explain.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.160
-Mogens, do you want to…
-No, you go ahead.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.560
Right. As you may recall,

14:12.640 --> 14:17.360
we had a mix-up in the egg tray
here a few years ago.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.520
Get to the point. What…

14:19.600 --> 14:20.560
Mogens?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.440
Would you…

14:23.160 --> 14:24.880
No, please continue.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.240
It's the funniest thing. As it turns out,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.040
we didn't switch them after all.

14:35.760 --> 14:40.520
-What?
-So we had everything under control.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.160
You've got to be kidding me.
Are they kidding?

14:43.240 --> 14:44.680
No, Malte. It's true.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.080
Our doctor found out
that Leo's blood type doesn't match ours.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.440
-That's absolutely insane!
-How the hell could this happen?

14:51.520 --> 14:54.280
Well, they had actually
been switched, but then…

14:56.160 --> 14:57.480
then Lone messed things up.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.920
Who the hell is Lone?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.960
-Our nurse. Yes.
-Our nurse.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.560
She found the mistake and corrected it,
making everything right again.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.640
-Typical women.
-But then…

15:08.720 --> 15:11.080
-And she didn't tell you?
-She did.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.920
Or she claims she did, but…

15:15.840 --> 15:18.320
You know how it is
with those kinds of women.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.320
-She's been fired, of course.
-Yes.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.920
Let me just get this straight.
You've known all along?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.320
-Why are we only hearing about it now?
-At that point, you'd already switched.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.040
-Right.
-And we were terribly busy.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.680
Oh yeah? With what?

15:34.760 --> 15:39.280
Well, and Thorbjørn figured
you'd be happier not knowing.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.160
Weren't you much happier
before you found out?

15:45.200 --> 15:49.520
Don't forget,
you got two healthy kids out of this.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.880
-You wouldn't do without them, right?
-Well, almost.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.800
I obviously don't mean that.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.680
All right. So what do we do now?

16:01.760 --> 16:05.200
Well, we figured you'd be satisfied
with the kids you got, so…

16:07.200 --> 16:10.040
wouldn't it be easier
to just forget the whole thing?

16:10.120 --> 16:13.760
-Let bygones be bygones, you know?
-Right, done deal.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.520
-We can't just do that.
-All right. Then you could just switch.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.920
I mean, maybe do
the baby switcheroo again.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.240
I'll sue them,
then I'll drag them through media hell.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.720
-And then I'll crush them so they never--
-Is that such a good idea, Cecilie?

16:38.800 --> 16:41.840
-You're not going to drag my kid anywhere.
-Which one of them?

16:42.320 --> 16:45.240
-Shouldn't we focus on the children?
-Liv is right.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.600
This is about Leo and Sille.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.760
Sille.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.960
I can't believe my daughter has
almost the same name as me.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.160
-Absurd.
-What about me?

16:54.840 --> 16:56.880
I had Sille's name tattooed on me.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.120
-Oh lord.
-Wow.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.320
-But it explains a lot.
-What do you mean?

17:03.400 --> 17:06.640
It makes sense that Sille is so…
And Leo is…

17:06.720 --> 17:08.600
-What do you mean?
-What do you think?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.320
-What do you mean?
-Excuse me.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.640
We're getting sidetracked.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.760
-We should be able to find a solution.
-How?

17:15.840 --> 17:20.160
In a way, they were right when they said
we were happier before we knew.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.880
And nobody else knows,
so perhaps we should just move on?

17:23.960 --> 17:27.960
-My daughter can't be raised by those two.
-Sille is not your daughter.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.240
Okay. Remind me who gave birth to her
and shares her genes?

17:32.320 --> 17:35.240
-Okay, but then Leo is actually ours.
-Yes, he is.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.720
How does that feel, Cecilie?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.720
I suggest we take a time-out.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.920
Let's all go home and talk things through.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.840
We can meet tomorrow
and calmly figure out a solution.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.800
Great idea.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.640
-Yes.
-Great.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.080
Great.

17:56.160 --> 18:00.160
Right. Let's all go home
and pretend everything is normal.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.520
The most important thing
is not to cause the kids to panic.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.240
-Oh God.
-The kids!

18:05.320 --> 18:08.720
-Oh no!
-Can I have the check, please?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.320
Hi, sweet Sille.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.880
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hi, honey.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.800
Hi.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.840
Welcome. I'm glad you could make it.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.440
-We're sorry.
-So sorry, Janus.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.800
Don't worry about it.
It's not like I have my own life to live.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.280
We know, but…
we've had the most chaotic day.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.920
Hi, sweetheart.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.400
It's a bit complicated, but…

19:16.400 --> 19:20.240
we've just found out that Leo
is actually Liv and Malte's child.

19:20.320 --> 19:24.120
And Sille is Cecilie's and my child.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.120
-Right, that's how we feel too.
-Yeah.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.160
There!

19:35.240 --> 19:38.640
She's taking all the credit
for that perfect grandchild?

19:39.360 --> 19:40.640
-Who?
-Ulla.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.600
-But we'll see who gets the last laugh.
-No one is laughing at all, Mom.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.520
We were the ones
who insisted on switching them back.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
Right, Andreas.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.280
We wouldn't have had any issues
if we had listened to Liv.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.080
Gosh. You found it.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.400
Yes. Here.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.360
-Oh my, this is the album with--
-Oh, no, you don't.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.760
There.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.320
She looks just like me.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.080
She's so pretty.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.000
Oh, the sweet little thing.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.720
Oh… She's the spitting image of you.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.640
Honey?

20:32.360 --> 20:34.800
You just keep calm and carry on.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.160
The universe gave you that child,
and no one is claiming my grandchild.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.720
But this isn't just about Sille anymore.
It's about Leo too.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.920
How will he feel
when he finds out as an adult?

20:48.480 --> 20:49.680
I can't let him down.

20:49.760 --> 20:53.240
It's a shame that he has to grow up
in that manipulative family--

20:53.320 --> 20:56.320
-Tulip.
-Honey, you have to agree that--

20:56.400 --> 20:59.720
-Mom!
-The environment you grow up in matters.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.400
-A lot, actually.
-Yes, but so do the genes.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.400
I thought a lot about it growing up.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.360
What do you mean?

21:10.440 --> 21:11.680
I mean that

21:12.920 --> 21:15.120
I'm sad I didn't know my father.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.640
Don't be. He wasn't worth meeting.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.760
That's your opinion, Mom.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.480
He's my dad.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.880
Maybe I would feel different.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.280
You never gave me the chance to find out.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.000
You've never said
you wanted to know about him.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.800
Well, I'm saying it now.

21:31.880 --> 21:35.560
I don't know.
Perhaps it's this crazy situation, but…

21:37.280 --> 21:39.120
It's important to know
where you come from.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.920
His name is, as you know,
Poul. Poul Frederiksen.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.280
He was studying medicine
when I became pregnant.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.280
Medicine? You said he was on welfare.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.680
Welfare, student grant,
what's the difference?

21:51.760 --> 21:52.800
I see.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.680
I always imagined he was an artist
or a musician or something like that.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.720
He became something boring.
A scientist or a doctor or something.

22:05.960 --> 22:06.960
Welcome.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.880
How can I help you?

22:18.680 --> 22:21.840
-Do you have a minute, Jan?
-If you can do it in ten seconds.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.880
Remember the case
with my friend a few years back?

22:31.720 --> 22:34.240
Who had her fertilized egg switched?

22:34.320 --> 22:37.840
Oh, right. What a circus.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.760
Yes.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.800
Now it freaking turns out
the eggs weren't switched after all.

22:46.880 --> 22:52.040
So she got their child,
and her genetic child ended up with them.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.400
That sounds complicated as hell.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.920
Yes, it's quite a mess.

22:59.720 --> 23:05.440
I'm now wondering if there's
anything legal she should keep in mind?

23:05.520 --> 23:08.360
I really can't say. Ask Max.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.720
-Max?
-Yes. His specialty is family law.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.400
Typical.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.840
Oh, I don't know, Cecilie.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.640
Legally speaking, I think we could wrest
the child back to your friend.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.840
As a rule, you're entitled
to the child you gave birth to.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.880
Even though it was a few years ago?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.320
It depends on the child's attachment.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.480
I can look into it, but I think the court
would rule for the biological mother.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.240
It's an interesting custody case.
Right up my alley.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.640
But we still don't know
if she wants to do it.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.840
There's the son too. My friend's son.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.040
I don't know if she'll part with him.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.680
I don't think she'll get both, Cecilie.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.240
Unless there's neglect involved.

23:55.080 --> 23:58.040
It'll get really complicated
if we have to prove

23:58.120 --> 24:02.320
that the parents are,
in fact, unfit to raise a child.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.880
Right. Unfortunately, they're not.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.320
Right.

24:08.200 --> 24:12.080
If she won't part with the other child,
then maybe a better idea

24:12.160 --> 24:15.320
would be to just agree
to some kind of blended family life.

24:18.680 --> 24:19.880
I'm sorry, what?

24:19.960 --> 24:21.360
-Co-living.
-Co-living.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.640
Right, but how did you imagine
that would work?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.280
You could move in here.
We have a giant house.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.200
You could make extra money
by renting out your allotment house.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.560
Yes, allotment gardens are in high demand.
Yours is in a great location.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.800
Listen. If we do this,

24:42.680 --> 24:45.320
we can be with our kids all the time.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.520
Right? You'll get the big guest room,
of course, the one with the balcony.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.440
-Facing south.
-The dining room and kitchen are communal.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.640
And the cars?

24:54.720 --> 24:56.240
Our cars are your cars.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.440
I mean, when we're not using them.
Right, honey?

25:00.520 --> 25:01.600
-That's great!
-No…

25:01.680 --> 25:04.520
We'll have a lot more energy
if we help each other with the chores.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.080
Dropping them off and picking them up.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.160
Or what, Liv?

25:08.680 --> 25:10.280
Would you rather just switch?

25:10.360 --> 25:13.480
If we switch, Leo will start
soccer practice. He's obviously a natural.

25:13.560 --> 25:17.000
-I'd never give up Leo.
-No, but Sille is your real daughter.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.720
If you could pick now,
who would you choose?

25:20.760 --> 25:21.840
I don't want to choose.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.400
I'll never give up Sille.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.160
Exactly. That's what I mean.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.840
How would you feel
if your biological child grew up

25:29.920 --> 25:31.920
without you being part of their life?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.680
I need to be close
to my biological daughter.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.280
So, co-living.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.960
It's a very nice idea.

25:46.280 --> 25:49.760
I just don't think
I could feel at home here, when it's so--

25:49.840 --> 25:54.440
Liv, of course, you can make it your own,
however you like.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.200
-Yes…
-And the park outside?

25:56.280 --> 25:58.960
-Could we make it a soccer field?
-Well…

25:59.040 --> 26:01.720
Of course.
Take out all the rose bushes you want.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.360
-Great!
-That's how much we want it.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.760
Yes.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.760
-It's a great idea.
-Right, but then what?

26:09.840 --> 26:12.800
-Will we be living according to rules?
-Rules schmules.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.320
You'll live your life as you always have.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.840
I think it could be quite amazing.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.000
All right, let's do it.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.240
Looks great there.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.080
Thank you. I'll take that.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.360
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.120
-Cheers.
-Cheers, honey.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.520
You're eating that?

27:49.360 --> 27:50.280
Leo!

28:16.240 --> 28:17.440
Sleep tight.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.880
-Here.
-No!

28:22.360 --> 28:23.240
There…

28:47.760 --> 28:48.600
Christ…

28:52.840 --> 28:53.680
Christ!

28:57.840 --> 28:59.400
Jump, Mom.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.040
Yes, you go jump.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.520
-Good morning.
-Yes, such a great morning.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.120
Christ…

29:20.760 --> 29:22.040
Is everything okay?

29:22.120 --> 29:25.800
I didn't sleep so well.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.080
That sucks.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.120
-Want to do yoga with me?
-No, thanks.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.920
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.320
That looks nice. Who wants coffee?

29:39.720 --> 29:41.040
Double espresso.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.040
Is there any more milk?

29:44.600 --> 29:47.200
Milk? We've got goat's milk. Is that okay?

29:47.280 --> 29:50.120
Goat's milk? Wow. Can you foam it?

29:50.840 --> 29:52.480
I don't know.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.640
-I'll give it a try.
-Do that.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.000
Sille isn't having Kinder milk slices.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.920
-Why not?
-We don't eat those in our family.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.320
A little milk won't harm her.
Right, Sille?

30:06.960 --> 30:11.440
Imagine if you just love milk and meat,
and you're forced to be vegan.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.280
That would be a shame. Right?

30:14.040 --> 30:17.000
We don't force her to do anything.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.080
And it's not about the milk.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.920
-They're full of palm oil.
-Palms are plants.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.040
What's the problem?

30:23.120 --> 30:27.360
Its production causes
huge humanitarian and climate challenges.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.440
And I just want my daughter
to grow up in a better world. Period.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.720
Thank you.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.640
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.440
-Christ…
-Good morning.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.600
-Good morning.
-Sleep well?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.440
-Yes. What about you?
-Yes.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.120
-Thanks for letting me sleep.
-You're welcome. You taking over?

30:51.640 --> 30:53.520
-See you tonight.
-Tonight?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.920
-Don't forget, my mom's coming later.
-Your mom?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.760
-It's Wednesday.
-What happens on Wednesdays?

30:59.480 --> 31:03.280
-My mom cooks dinner every Wednesday.
-But now things have changed.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.960
But you told us
to keep on living like normal.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.480
You did say that.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.720
You better be careful.
You don't want to be late.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.200
Right, I have a showing
of that double plot

31:13.280 --> 31:15.560
which is impossible to sell,
so wish me luck.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.040
-See you, honey.
-See you.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.760
-Have a nice day, Malte.
-See you.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.600
-Bye.
-Bye, kids. Love you.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.080
Malte, they should be placed bottom up,
all the way to the left.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.440
Thank you.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.080
-Do you always go to work this late?
-We have a seminar today.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.760
-Seminar?
-A team-building seminar.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.080
And you? Don't electricians get up
before the crack of dawn?

31:43.160 --> 31:46.160
We do, but Liv and I take turns.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.200
Someone has to drop off the princess.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.280
Could you take Leo to daycare as well?

31:54.360 --> 31:56.640
Sure. That's the point of all this, right?

32:01.760 --> 32:04.800
POUL FREDERIKSEN

32:07.400 --> 32:09.920
DANISH DOCTOR, PH.D. AND ENTREPRENEUR

32:14.520 --> 32:18.440
Honey, I just moved the late client.
Why did you book another one?

32:19.200 --> 32:22.840
Because we want more customers
to grow the business.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.640
I don't think we need that.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.240
You shouldn't work yourself to death.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.320
No, but I want to do it.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.120
-Why are you looking up Poul?
-Because I'm curious.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.680
How come you broke off contact with him?

32:39.080 --> 32:40.680
It all got so complicated.

32:40.760 --> 32:44.640
And he was always busy with his career.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.640
Couldn't I have seen him once in a while?

32:48.240 --> 32:50.840
Are you saying I'm not enough for you?

32:50.920 --> 32:54.240
No! It's just that I see
how important Malte is for Sille.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.200
I'd have liked having that
with my dad too.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.800
That's not a good idea.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.720
Why not?

33:03.320 --> 33:04.360
Well, because

33:05.560 --> 33:07.400
he didn't want anything to do with you.

33:07.480 --> 33:10.480
He chose his job over us. Over you.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.080
And the two of you are very different.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.880
Fortunately, you're more like me.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.600
He's nothing to get excited about.
Trust me.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.080
Even during the onboarding process,
it's all about alignment.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.920
We need to play to each other's strengths.
We do that by streamlining work patterns.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.560
-What a load of crap.
-It's not crap, Cecilie.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.840
It's exciting to hear
what everyone thinks.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.560
Very exciting.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.360
Thank you. As I said,
one of the cornerstones, like we said,

33:43.440 --> 33:45.640
is this stakeholder one-on-one situation,

33:45.720 --> 33:48.240
where people feel
that alignment is in place.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.200
And that's why the element

33:50.280 --> 33:53.400
of streamlining
those work patterns is so essential

33:53.480 --> 33:55.960
for the transition to the normal…

33:56.480 --> 33:57.800
What's going on, Cecilie?

33:59.720 --> 34:03.080
I'm sorry. I'm on pick-up duty today.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.480
So I have to leave soon.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.000
You can't miss this.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.280
-It's too important.
-But, Jan--

34:08.360 --> 34:10.440
You have to stick around until we're done.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.720
It's only… What's the time, Max?

34:13.920 --> 34:15.360
It's only 4:00 p.m.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.120
Right. It's only 4:00 p.m.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.520
It's still early.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.400
Thank you, Cecilie. Go on.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.360
Right. This creates the flow
needed for the transition

34:31.440 --> 34:34.200
to the normal team cadence
that lifts the energy.

34:34.280 --> 34:38.880
Yes. You'll have it when I get
to the office first thing in the morning.

34:38.960 --> 34:42.320
I just have two things
I need to check first.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.640
-Okay.
-We still have time before the deadline.

34:44.720 --> 34:47.920
-It's urgent.
-I promise you'll have it tomorrow.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.640
I just need to… Hi.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.680
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET YOUR CHILD

34:53.960 --> 34:56.360
I have to go. Talk to you later.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.040
Hi, Janus.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.280
I'm sorry.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.600
I'm sorry, I know it's two minutes to…
two minutes past. My meeting dragged on.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.120
Tell that to Leo, okay?

35:07.200 --> 35:08.120
Right.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.840
Leo, I'm sorry.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.040
Hi, sweetie.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.600
Hi, sweetie.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.800
And this one.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.760
-This one.
-No, not that one, honey.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.320
-We're eating this.
-No.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.760
Let's put it back.
We're going home to eat dinner. Come on.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.560
Leo, come on!

35:48.880 --> 35:49.720
Christ…

35:51.880 --> 35:54.720
-Hi, Jan.
-Where are the documents you promised?

35:54.800 --> 35:57.920
-They're ready, right?
-Yes. You'll have them later.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.200
I'm on top of it. You'll get them later.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.760
-As long as you promise…
-No, stop.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.400
-Excuse me?
-Put it back! Don't lick those!

36:05.480 --> 36:08.640
-Lick what?
-Not you, Jan. Give me that.

36:09.320 --> 36:13.720
-I need them now.
-They're not expecting them till the 12th.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.640
-That may very well be…
-Yes.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.920
Cecilie, I prefer
to stay ahead on this, okay?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.960
Yes, of course.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.680
Give me that. We're going home for dinner.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.240
We're not eating chips now!

36:26.760 --> 36:28.160
Sorry, Leo is just…

36:28.240 --> 36:29.080
-Hello?
-Leo?

36:29.160 --> 36:32.280
Leo, stay here!
Jan, you'll get them later. I'll call.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.680
Leo?

36:34.600 --> 36:35.840
What a damn little brat!

36:36.360 --> 36:37.400
What?

36:43.960 --> 36:46.400
-What's going on here?
-Hi, Cecilie.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.760
I'm removing the bad energies.

36:49.480 --> 36:50.960
Bad energies?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.760
This commune thing is so great.

36:52.840 --> 36:57.720
-I didn't know you were into that stuff.
-Perhaps I'm not at all like you think.

36:59.120 --> 37:02.080
You should get a sex room
now that you've got the chance.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.320
Your body clearly needs orgasmic release.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.560
That's one of the benefits
of communal living. More hands.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.880
I'm at your disposal as well.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.440
For babysitting, I mean.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.920
I have to put away the groceries.

37:15.000 --> 37:15.920
You do that.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.600
And then go enjoy
the nice weather with the others.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.760
-Christ, what is that smell?
-Baked tofu.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.080
With celery compote. Nice, right?

37:31.640 --> 37:34.000
No. That's a crocodile and a tiger.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.640
-That's not a tiger.
-Then what is it?

37:36.720 --> 37:39.280
A lion. It doesn't have stripes.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.200
Go, score! Come on!

37:41.280 --> 37:43.800
Yes! You're fantastic.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.600
Amazing coordination.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.000
-You got that from me.
-Not from me?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.200
-No. I suppose it's from you.
-Mom play?

37:53.280 --> 37:55.160
-Should I ask Mom to join us?
-Yes.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.520
-Can you get the ball?
-Honey, Leo wants you to come play.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.160
-I'm hanging out with Sille.
-Okay.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.000
Great.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.320
Look. How many are there?

38:07.400 --> 38:08.960
Three, that's right.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.680
-And how many are there?
-One.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.160
-Yes, that's right.
-Hello, you two.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.520
-Hi, Liv.
-What are you doing?

38:16.600 --> 38:20.280
She's solving problems.
She's so good. It's for four-year-olds.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.240
She aces them.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.600
Sille shouldn't play with iPads.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.840
She's not playing. She's doing math.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.040
Math?

38:28.640 --> 38:29.960
She's only two years old.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.240
But she likes it.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.560
Right, Sille-bug? You think it's fun.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.920
-Yes.
-You're calling her "Sille-bug"?

38:39.200 --> 38:41.600
Yes. I mean, unless you mind?

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
No. It's fine.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.160
But, Cecilie,

38:48.040 --> 38:49.760
please respect it when I say no iPad.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.440
Come on, Leo! Yes!

38:53.520 --> 38:54.840
Let me grab that.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.640
Score a goal past Dad.

38:56.720 --> 39:00.360
-What are you doing?
-Yes! All right! Wow!

39:03.480 --> 39:05.600
-What's up?
-He still won't sleep?

39:05.680 --> 39:07.160
Andreas is still trying.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.400
Christ!

39:09.480 --> 39:11.240
Right. Here you go.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.040
There.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.200
No, just…

39:14.800 --> 39:17.040
-Okay.
-Finally, dinner for the adults.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.240
I see we're having a party
with limited invitations.

39:26.320 --> 39:30.440
-We just stopped by to say hi.
-Join us. There's plenty of food.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.880
No, thank you, we've already eaten.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.240
-What are you celebrating?
-The new commune.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.960
-A commune?
-Well, Liv and Malte have moved in.

39:41.040 --> 39:41.920
With Sille.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.360
-Moved in here?
-Isn't it great?

39:44.440 --> 39:46.280
Just like when we were young.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.240
Everyone shared everything
in the spirit of community.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.320
Great times, right?

39:50.840 --> 39:54.120
You can't just mix
your lives together like that.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.960
It'll be pure chaos.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.880
Children need structure and boundaries.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.480
I'm just saying.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.560
Nonsense, Irene. Children need love.

40:03.640 --> 40:07.120
-And now they're getting twice as much.
-Has she known all along?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.040
-We've just been so busy.
-Have you lost your mind?

40:11.120 --> 40:13.000
-No.
-What's next?

40:13.080 --> 40:17.440
Shared finances? A hen house?
Braiding each other's armpit hair?

40:17.520 --> 40:18.960
Calm down.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.680
We're getting all tense
from the bad vibes you're bringing.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.600
I deeply apologize, Ulla.
Come, Lars. We're leaving.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.360
-Come on.
-I didn't mean it like that.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.360
I'll handle it.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.000
Mom.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.160
Wait a minute.

40:35.240 --> 40:38.240
If she's going to be showing up here
whenever she wants,

40:38.320 --> 40:39.880
I am done visiting.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.760
-Let's not--
-That woman drives me insane!

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
A few birthdays I can handle,

40:44.920 --> 40:47.040
but I won't let her invade
my daughter's home.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.800
Yes, she's over the top.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.400
But if we want to see Sille,
then we all have to make some sacrifices.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.880
There has to be another solution.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.640
You should get to decide
when and how you want to see her.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.200
She's your daughter!

41:00.800 --> 41:03.920
Right. But unfortunately,
it's not that simple.

41:40.320 --> 41:43.160
A bit higher there. Oh God!

41:49.160 --> 41:51.360
Oh, Malte! Malte!

41:54.320 --> 41:58.040
Yes, I know. I'll email you
the documents, okay?

41:58.120 --> 42:02.040
-As soon as I get into the office.
-They have to get them on time.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.600
I promise it'll be before 9:00 a.m.
Yes. All right, bye.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.080
Good morning.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.720
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.360
-Thanks for last night.
-Right back at you.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.120
Do we have to be naked
now that we're all living together?

42:24.600 --> 42:26.880
-I'll go put on some clothes.
-Do that.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.440
-Good morning, Malte.
-Good morning.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.320
-Good morning.
-You're an early bird.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.280
Yes, always.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.360
Good morning, honey.
I'm letting Leo blow off some steam.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.000
He's got a lot of energy this morning.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.760
Sille, are you just bored over there?

42:44.840 --> 42:47.160
You should have
something exciting to play with.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.280
This is both fun and challenging.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.480
Look what I have for you. An ABC puzzle.

42:54.560 --> 42:57.880
Look. That's S for "snake."

42:57.960 --> 42:59.720
-Where does that go?
-Here!

43:00.440 --> 43:01.640
That's right.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.160
Cecilie? I don't think
you should give her such advanced puzzles.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.120
Something simpler
with colors or animal sounds

43:09.200 --> 43:11.160
is better-suited to a two-year-old.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.360
Puzzles are harmful too now?

43:13.440 --> 43:17.400
Do you know how unhealthy it is
to push a child too early?

43:17.480 --> 43:20.480
Kids should be primal,
at least until they're four.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.640
You don't want Sille to play
with anything that stimulates the brain?

43:24.720 --> 43:27.560
-That will hinder her development.
-This one…

43:27.640 --> 43:29.720
Thanks, but she'll be fine.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.640
-Leo doesn't play with that stuff.
-Because he can't.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.920
Leo is far behind
in his development compared to Sille.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.720
I used to blame myself for that,
but not anymore.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.600
-Now I'm thinking it's the genes.
-You don't think environment plays a role?

43:44.680 --> 43:45.920
No, not in this case.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.440
Let's try to maintain
that happy morning vibe we have here.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.200
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.120
This is an "A" for asshole.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.200
Leo!

44:02.240 --> 44:05.880
-Last call if you want breakfast!
-No breakfast.

44:07.160 --> 44:09.800
-I'll make the lunch boxes.
-I got it.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.720
-I want to do it.
-But I've got it.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.880
-Malte? That one can't handle detergent.
-Which one?

44:16.960 --> 44:19.520
-That one. I'll take that one.
-Right, sure.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.800
-Ouch.
-Sorry.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.840
What's wrong? Is your back hurting, Malte?

44:23.920 --> 44:27.440
Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's the bad postures at work.

44:27.520 --> 44:29.160
-It often hurts.
-What's this?

44:31.280 --> 44:33.680
No, Sille. We're not playing with iPads.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.440
This is your fault, Cecilie.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.000
Coffee, anyone?
We barely slept last night.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.520
Did Leo keep you awake again?

44:44.680 --> 44:46.960
It's probably my fault.
I didn't sleep until I was ten.

44:50.040 --> 44:54.440
Thanks for giving Leo those genes.
And I'm glad you find it amusing.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.480
Thanks for giving me a fussy daughter
who won't get her hands dirty.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.160
-Anytime.
-Thanks. I might just take you up on that.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.440
-Ten damn years!
-Fine.

45:28.400 --> 45:29.880
House meeting tonight!

45:40.520 --> 45:42.120
What's this, sweetie?

45:42.760 --> 45:43.600
Oh, nothing.

45:43.680 --> 45:47.280
I just thought a change might be nice.
Doesn't this optimize the room better?

45:48.000 --> 45:51.480
It's a nice thought,
but I liked it the way it was.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.680
Just like it's always been.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.240
Come and help me put this thing back.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.400
Sure, okay…

45:59.880 --> 46:01.240
-Come on.
-Right.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.160
Yes.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.800
I have a craniosacral therapy appointment
to prepare for.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.440
In the meantime, put the rest back, right?

46:19.000 --> 46:22.600
DANISH PHARMA COMPANY DEVELOPS EQUIPMENT
FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS THROUGH BIOPSY

47:04.520 --> 47:05.360
Can I help you?

47:06.520 --> 47:07.360
Yes.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.000
You can.

47:10.120 --> 47:10.960
Is Poul here?

47:11.560 --> 47:12.600
Poul Frederiksen.

47:12.680 --> 47:15.560
Yes. But he's meeting
with the Childhood Cancer Foundation.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.040
Do you have an appointment?

47:17.880 --> 47:18.760
No.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.600
Never mind.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.680
No, let me ask you,

47:30.600 --> 47:33.000
is Poul a good boss?

47:34.440 --> 47:36.920
Yes. In fact, he's the best.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.800
He always gives
personal gifts on birthdays.

47:39.880 --> 47:42.400
He lets us take the time off we need
if our children are sick.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.160
Why?

47:44.800 --> 47:46.640
Nothing. Thanks.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.320
-Okay.
-Bye.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.160
HOW DO WE BEST SECURE
CHILDREN'S WELFARE AND TREATMENT?

48:10.240 --> 48:13.240
Would you like to leave a message or…?

48:13.320 --> 48:16.360
-I could interrupt his meeting.
-No, don't do that.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.040
I just… I'm sorry.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.720
Whenever you have the time.
Preferably now.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.120
Should I ask Max?

48:32.200 --> 48:34.280
-Yes?
-No. I've got it.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.760
Good. Have it done by 10:00 p.m.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.880
Absolutely.

48:45.240 --> 48:50.840
Cecilie, how's it going
with that friend of yours?

48:51.640 --> 48:53.560
-Who?
-The one with the commune?

48:54.440 --> 48:57.200
Oh, the one with the family commune…

48:59.760 --> 49:02.080
It's going… well.

49:02.160 --> 49:08.200
I just figured if it wasn't working out,
I could still take on the custody case.

49:08.280 --> 49:09.640
That's great to know.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.200
But things are going swimmingly.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.960
-Okay, that's great.
-Wonderful.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.600
-How nice.
-Yes.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.720
"Cockporn"!

49:20.360 --> 49:21.760
-"Cockporn"!
-Hi, honey.

49:27.120 --> 49:30.400
-"Cockporn"! We want it!
-Okay.

49:30.480 --> 49:33.560
-"Cockporn"?
-Yes, we made popcorn. Right, Leo?

49:34.240 --> 49:37.480
-Ah, you made popcorn.
-"Cockporn"!

49:37.560 --> 49:40.680
-Where's Sille?
-She got picked up a while ago.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.920
I'd just arranged with Liv
to pick up both.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.520
"Cockporn"!

49:46.600 --> 49:48.600
Liv said they were having
some quality time.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.440
"Cockporn"!

49:51.720 --> 49:54.240
-Leo.
-"Cockporn"!

49:55.200 --> 49:56.640
-Hi.
-"Cockporn"!

49:56.720 --> 49:58.000
Quiet, Leo.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.160
Right. Welcome to the house meeting.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.800
We need to rethink our onboarding process.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.000
I think we can all agree,

50:06.080 --> 50:08.000
we weren't on the same page
from the start.

50:08.080 --> 50:12.160
-I don't understand a thing.
-We must play to each other's strengths.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.320
Yes, please.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.800
How do we do that?

50:15.880 --> 50:20.080
By streamlining
our work processes as shown here.

50:20.160 --> 50:23.360
-Is this my date muffin recipe, Andreas?
-Yes, they're so good.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.840
I'm considering serving them
at my open house showings.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.800
-What a great idea.
-Thank you.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.520
Oh God!

50:31.320 --> 50:34.400
Here's rule number one. Decent clothing.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.080
Everyone above the age of two
wears clothes in the house.

50:37.160 --> 50:39.880
Shouldn't kids have
a natural understanding of the body?

50:39.960 --> 50:43.800
-No, thank you, Malte. Rule number two--
-No, we take turns, right?

50:44.320 --> 50:48.840
I'd prefer if we only had gluten-free,
lactose-free, and sugar-free groceries.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.280
-Christ…
-Yes, Cecilie.

50:50.360 --> 50:53.400
My child… children should not
be addicted to that poison.

50:53.480 --> 50:56.760
Okay. So no brain food whatsoever?

50:56.840 --> 51:01.360
Sille and all other children need protein
to boost their development.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.000
-You can't live on rice cakes.
-I've got something.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.520
We should decorate the house
according to feng shui.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.440
-Feng what?
-Feng shui.

51:08.520 --> 51:13.440
Liv and I discussed the interplay
between humans and their surroundings.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.360
I haven't been sleeping as well
since we moved the bed.

51:16.440 --> 51:21.360
Your sleep troubles could be because
our child turns into a gremlin at night.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.440
Apropos, we should try letting
the kids sleep in the same room.

51:25.520 --> 51:29.720
-Co-sleeping is supposedly quite healthy.
-I doubt it. But we can try.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.680
-Let's move on.
-Cecilie?

51:32.320 --> 51:37.280
I'd like to lower the level of conflict
in this house by establishing a code word

51:37.360 --> 51:39.680
to use when our boundaries
have been crossed.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.920
-A code word?
-It has helped me and my mom a lot.

51:44.440 --> 51:47.280
-For example, our code word is "tulip."
-How cute.

51:47.360 --> 51:51.960
-Very pedagogical.
-I have a very pedagogical mind, Cecilie.

51:52.040 --> 51:56.400
And I think Sille and Leo
should switch to a Waldorf daycare.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.000
I'm not happy
with the current artistic initiatives

51:59.080 --> 52:01.480
and lack of anthroposophic insight.

52:01.560 --> 52:02.720
-Honey--
-I'm not.

52:02.800 --> 52:05.560
Now she's sitting here
undermining Danish public education.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.480
Yes.

52:06.560 --> 52:09.360
So you're saying Sille and Leo
shouldn't be academically stimulated.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.600
Should we just suppress them
and push them into the world

52:12.680 --> 52:15.160
to become unemployed artists or musicians?

52:15.240 --> 52:18.160
-Musicians are, in fact, artists.
-Yes, they are.

52:18.240 --> 52:20.520
-Dad!
-Not again.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.200
No, I'll go. This house meeting is over.

52:23.280 --> 52:26.520
-I'm not done.
-I am! I can't handle any more tonight.

52:29.640 --> 52:30.480
Christ…

52:32.600 --> 52:34.760
-Leo, why aren't you sleeping?
-Not Mom.

52:34.840 --> 52:38.480
Lie down, okay?
It's late. Sille is sleeping.

52:39.480 --> 52:41.720
-Not Mom.
-No, not Mom.

52:41.800 --> 52:45.160
Never Mom. But you have to sleep
because I can't take it anymore!

52:48.560 --> 52:49.440
I'm sorry.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.360
I'm sorry, honey.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.680
-Binky.
-Oh, sweetheart.

53:07.640 --> 53:08.760
I'm sorry, honey.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.440
Oh, hi!

53:24.440 --> 53:27.440
Sorry, I'm just borrowing your toilet.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.600
Ours is clogged, so…

53:31.320 --> 53:33.680
And then I took a quick bath in the tub.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.360
We don't have one in our bathroom,
so I hope it's okay.

53:38.400 --> 53:41.240
-So are you done now?
-Yes, I'm done.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.960
-So can I use my own bathroom?
-Yes, of course.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.400
-Good night.
-Good night.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.320
Christ.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.080
I think the house meeting went well.

54:30.040 --> 54:31.520
Put away the computer.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.640
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not freaking okay.

54:37.200 --> 54:40.080
Our home has been invaded
by a biodynamic Bedouin circus.

54:40.160 --> 54:42.800
-This was your idea.
-A piss-poor idea.

54:44.080 --> 54:46.680
I like all of us living together.

54:47.600 --> 54:50.200
In for a penny, in for a pound, Cecilie.

54:52.040 --> 54:56.520
-Sweetie, isn't it time for bed?
-I have to deliver this tonight.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.480
I see. Well, thank you for today.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.360
-Sleep well.
-Yes.

55:28.400 --> 55:32.080
Cecilie, I can't believe you.
That's too much.

55:32.160 --> 55:35.440
I fell asleep. I had to deliver it
by 10:00 p.m. last night.

55:35.520 --> 55:38.400
You're going to burn out
if you're not careful.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.280
-Your job is not that important.
-Yes, it is.

55:41.360 --> 55:45.200
-If I want that promotion…
-To hell with the promotion.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.880
I'm about to turn 50, honey!
It's now or never.

55:47.960 --> 55:50.480
Max is constantly breathing down my neck.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.200
And I always feel guilty about Leo.

55:53.280 --> 55:57.280
Apparently, I can't do anything right! I…

55:58.760 --> 56:01.280
-Maybe Leo and I are just a bad match.
-Stop.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.040
-It's possible.
-Listen.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.600
You need to take it easy.

56:05.680 --> 56:08.200
Right? Maybe take a vacation.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.240
Or a leave of absence.

56:10.320 --> 56:13.160
It might let you bond more with Leo.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.680
Just think about it, okay?

56:17.560 --> 56:19.760
Liv, it's no good. She's got a fever.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.720
Yes, but my whole day is booked.

56:21.800 --> 56:24.760
What should I do?
Neither of us can stay home.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.960
-She's got a fever?
-Yes.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.440
Hi, sweetie. Can I have a feel?

56:33.880 --> 56:35.080
You're burning up.

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
Leo, come on. We have to go.

56:37.240 --> 56:40.240
Andreas, Sille's got a fever.
Could you take her?

56:40.320 --> 56:42.280
Sorry, I have seven showings today.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.520
What are we going to do?

56:46.800 --> 56:47.840
I can take her.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.840
-Really?
-Seriously?

56:51.360 --> 56:54.360
-Do you have the time?
-You said I needed a break.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.880
You've never taken the day off
for a sick child.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.720
No, I guess this will be my first.

56:59.240 --> 57:01.520
Thank you so much, Cecilie.

57:01.600 --> 57:05.200
Oh, sweetie. Get well soon.
Have a nice day. Come, Leo!

57:06.320 --> 57:09.160
-There…
-See you, sweetie. Thank you.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.440
-Off you go.
-Get well soon.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.960
-Come on. Yes.
-Bye.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.080
Bye.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.760
Well? Now it's just the two of us.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.840
-A lot of rabbits!
-There are so many rabbits!

57:21.920 --> 57:24.440
-Yes.
-Where? There's one there.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.960
-Yes.
-And there.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.240
-No.
-Oh?

57:27.320 --> 57:30.560
-Maybe I should hold it?
-Yes, maybe you should.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.800
That's right! All right!

57:32.880 --> 57:35.440
Seriously? Didn't the key say--

57:35.520 --> 57:37.080
-No!
-No!

57:37.160 --> 57:38.800
-No!
-No, really!

57:38.880 --> 57:40.840
Should we listen to what it says?

57:40.920 --> 57:42.240
Ding-dong.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.640
-Ding-dong. Come inside.
-Can I come in?

57:45.720 --> 57:47.760
Yes. Hello, I'd like to… Oh no!

57:47.840 --> 57:50.560
Should we try again? I'll sing along.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.320
A, B

57:52.400 --> 57:56.560
-C, D…
-C, D, E, S, G

57:57.680 --> 58:02.280
H, I, J, K, L, M, P

58:18.560 --> 58:20.080
-Hi, Jan.
-You're not here.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.920
And we need to finish the case.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
My child is sick, so--

58:24.080 --> 58:27.520
-I'll just have to give it to Max.
-Yes, you do that.

58:27.600 --> 58:28.680
Mom.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.800
You have to be available…

58:31.880 --> 58:33.400
I have to go, Jan. Bye.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.480
No, Cecilie--

58:34.560 --> 58:36.400
There…

58:36.480 --> 58:39.400
Hi. Did you just wake up?

58:39.480 --> 58:41.000
Will you look at this?

58:41.080 --> 58:43.520
Little sleepy mouse, come here.

58:44.040 --> 58:45.360
Sweetheart.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.320
Yes…

58:47.800 --> 58:51.200
Sweetie. Yes.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.240
Hi, Cecilie.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.000
Hi, Max. Did you get my mail
with the info on Iversen?

59:10.080 --> 59:11.080
-Yes.
-Good.

59:11.880 --> 59:13.200
Let me ask,

59:13.280 --> 59:17.200
that friend of mine,
who you know perfectly well is me,

59:17.880 --> 59:21.320
if she decided to move forward
with the custody case,

59:21.400 --> 59:23.920
what are the chances of winning it?

59:26.080 --> 59:28.720
I'd say 90/10 in our favor.

59:32.440 --> 59:34.200
Let's do it. Bye.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.120
Mom, did you ever hear from Poul?

59:44.120 --> 59:47.440
He never called or wrote on my birthday?

59:47.960 --> 59:49.120
-Nothing?
-No.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.560
And weren't we done with this?

59:52.240 --> 59:55.320
Yes, but, I mean,
sometimes people change their minds.

59:55.840 --> 59:58.440
Maybe he did, too, and wants to see me.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.000
I can't imagine that.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.520
That man was
the world's biggest narcissist.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.880
Are you sure?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.840
Yes!

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.560
He was completely egoistical, selfish,
with no regard for anyone but himself.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.560
And that's the end of that.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.840
-Thanks. See you, bye.
-See you.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.600
Hi, Dad.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.280
Hello, my darling. Hi.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.640
Look, there he is.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.480
That hat really suits you.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.320
-I'm stressed because I got a C.
-Don't be mad about getting a C.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.640
You got A's in the rest.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.960
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.760
I've booked a table at the steakhouse.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.080
-Let's go eat some T-bones!
-Yes!

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.960
-Press that one.
-That one.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.800
Yes. Let's see what happens.
Press it again.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.000
What don't you understand, Cecilie?
I said no iPad!

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.600
Easy, you're scaring her.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.480
-You're fucking messed up.
-Fine.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.440
I won't have my daughter paced to become
an A-student workaholic like you who--

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.400
Potato.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.200
What?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.160
That's our new anti-conflict code word
that you asked for. Potato.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.440
-Leo!
-Sille.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.400
-Sille?
-Cecilie, we need to talk about this.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.480
-Cecilie.
-Leo.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.800
-Sille!
-Leo!

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.560
Cecilie, stop. We have to talk about this.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.960
Oh yes!

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.200
It's really hard.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280
Ow, ow, ow.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.240
Oh yes.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.080
Oh yes.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.760
What are you doing?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.400
Malte's back was all messed up,

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.480
so I figured he could benefit
from Andreas's magical fingers.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
But, Andreas, why are you naked?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.480
I didn't want my clothes
to get all greasy.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.440
And you're using rapeseed oil
from the kitchen?

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.360
-Yes.
-At least it's not Vaseline.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.360
Hi, Cecilie.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.760
-Hi.
-We missed you yesterday.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.440
But Max handled the Iversen contract,
so that was good.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.480
I hope you won't make a habit
of taking those sick days off.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.120
That'd reduce your chances
of becoming partner.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.040
The whole team will be working
the next few weekends to make deadline.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.200
I expect you to do so too, for once.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.600
That's seriously enough, Jan, okay?
Cut it out right now!

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.400
I am the hardest-working employee
you've ever had.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.880
That means I'm the shittiest mom
who never gets to see her kid!

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.200
Shut the fuck up!

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.800
You got six months of maternity leave.
You don't know how lucky you are.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.640
No one here, man or woman,
has ever gotten that.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.440
-Doesn't that sound tragic to you?
-Nope.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.440
Right, well, listen here.
This stops right now.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.400
I'm not missing
any more time with my child. Period.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.880
Max, here's max work for you.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.160
I quit.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.400
Cecilie… After 11 years?

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.160
Can't we sit down
and have a calm discussion about it?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.440
I'm sure we can find a solution
that works for both of us.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.480
I'll tell you the solution.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.560
I'll be taking a really long time-out
from work and from you.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.160
That's the solution.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.720
Perhaps I won't be back
because I'll start my own firm.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.880
If anyone is just as tired
of this shitty, discriminating place,

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.320
you know where to find me.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.120
Honey? Andreas?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.640
I'm here, honey.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.480
I quit my job.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.080
-You what?
-Yes! I quit!

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.680
You were right.
I couldn't handle the pressure.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.520
I'm missing too much at home.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.960
But, honey, that's wonderful.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.440
You're so cool and brave.
And beautiful as well.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.000
And a bit out of my mind. Right?

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.320
And what about this palace?
Who's going to pay the mortgage?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.800
I don't know.
We'll just dip into our savings.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.800
Or we'll just have to move.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.920
What's going on?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.600
Cecilie just quit her job.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.520
-It's crazy.
-Congratulations.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.200
-That's great for all of us.
-What? Yes.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.320
Cecilie!

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.760
Sille-bug! Come here.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.560
Hi, sweetie. You know what I did?

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.960
I quit my job.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.920
So now I can be
with you and Leo all the time.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.280
Wonderful, right?

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Yes. Right, come here, Sille.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.600
We were just playing with blocks.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.640
Come here.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.120
Come here, sweetie.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.840
Let's go play with the blocks.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.920
Mom's little darling.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.800
Honey? I'm so proud of you for…

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.320
I'm sorry, but the fact that you
of all people quit your job?

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.200
COOL MOVE TODAY. JAN WAS COMPLETELY LOST
AND HAD TO GO HOME EARLY.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.720
STILL WANT ME TO FILE THE CASE?

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.680
Honey?

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.960
I promised Liv
that you wouldn't break her rules.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.200
Since you'll be spending
a lot more time alone with the kids.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.320
No learning games or iPads.
No breaking her rules, right?

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.120
YES

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.680
Can you fill these up?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.840
-No, you get over here to me.
-Coffee?

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.240
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.520
Have a nice day.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.600
-Have a nice day.
-Bye.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.080
What are you eating?

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.480
Good night.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.680
-Malte?
-Yes.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.240
I went to see my dad.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:07.920
What?

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.080
That's crazy! But

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.400
why now?

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.640
I think this mess with us and the kids
has made me think about my own childhood.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.760
And seeing how great you are as a father,

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.280
it's made me realize what I missed out on.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.720
Right, I get that.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.320
What was he like?

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.120
Not at all what I had imagined.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.280
Very career-minded. Ambitious.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.680
Okay.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.160
But I don't know
how he is as a human being.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.520
I didn't get to speak to him.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.080
Why not?

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.360
I got cold feet.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.160
And maybe my mom is right.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.920
Maybe he doesn't have room
for me in his life.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.720
You'll never know
if you don't give him the chance.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.360
But he rejected me back then.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.520
Now he's got a new life.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.320
And a new family.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.400
Never mind.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.240
Liv?

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.680
Honey?

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.080
Hey.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.440
I love you.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.520
And maybe you're right.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.840
Maybe he doesn't have room for you.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.920
But you just found him.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.120
I think you'll regret it if you don't try.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.360
And hey.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.000
If you find each other,

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.240
then Sille will have a granddad.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.960
Sille and Leo both.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.560
I'd love that.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.760
Come here.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.600
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.160
-Want to join?
-No.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.040
Come on. Grab a mat.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.920
Are you okay with being home?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.200
You don't miss work?

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.880
No. Right now I'm just enjoying it.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.200
No matter how fast I ran,
it was never enough.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.240
-Having small kids is not easy.
-No.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.920
I know I said I'd work less,
when I had a child, but

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.640
I just love treating people.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160
And things are starting to go so well.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.840
But I don't see Sille and Leo
as much as I want.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.840
Just enjoy your success.
You certainly shouldn't apologize for it.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.200
Malte thinks I'm away too much. It's hard.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.000
Don't feel guilty.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.440
The most important thing
is that you do what makes you happy, Liv.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.840
It's best for all of you.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.720
NO NEWS YET, BUT I EXPECT IT SOON

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.920
I dream about opening my own place.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.280
A place that's all mine,
where I'm the one deciding everything.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.840
I get that.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:53.320
Sometimes I feel like
I've suppressed some aspects of myself.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.440
As if there's more to me.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.800
Some drive or ambition.
Maybe I get it from my dad.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.000
And that's why
I haven't understood or fulfilled it.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.160
Understandable,
considering you don't know your origins.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.680
Yeah, maybe.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.120
It can be hard to figure out
what you got from your genes.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:16.560
As opposed to how you're affected
by the people around you.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.760
-Biology and environment.
-Right.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.280
Cecilie? Feel free to say no.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.880
But would you maybe come with me
to look at some locations?

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.320
I can't ask my mom or Malte.
They need a bit of persuasion.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.040
I'd love to.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.080
Seriously?

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.960
-That's so sweet of you.
-You're welcome.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.040
It feels great to finally
share it with someone.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.080
Thank you.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.760
Good. Let's go to Dog.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.600
We're going to the dogs?

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.960
-Let's go to the dogs, then.
-There.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.080
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.160
-And congratulations on the sale, honey.
-Yes, congrats!

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.200
Thanks. It felt great to sell Rosenvænget.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.960
Now there's just the plot on Jersin Allé.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.480
-That one bugs me.
-He's never satisfied.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.760
Hello.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.240
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.880
-How cozy.
-Yes.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.560
I brought a pair of goals
to make a proper soccer field.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.160
-What do you say?
-Yes! Let's play a match.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.760
-Sure.
-Yes!

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.880
Kids! Soccer time!

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.880
-Want to join, Liv?
-Okay!

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.960
A high kick!

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.360
-Who's in?
-I want to pick the teams.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.880
-Come on.
-Come on, kids.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.280
-A goal here.
-It's so pretty, sweetie.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.200
-And one over here.
-Here?

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.320
Are you okay?

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.360
Right now? Very much okay.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.720
Good.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.080
Take it! Kick!

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.720
-Come on!
-You're great!

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.280
I used to live in a commune
in my early twenties.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.720
I loved it.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.920
The sense of community.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.680
-I didn't know that, Dad.
-No.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.240
It wasn't really your mom's thing.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.000
A bit too alternative for her taste.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.240
Deep down, she probably feared
it would get too messy.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.560
With too many ladies.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:35.960
And were there?

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.360
Well, there was one…

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:40.800
Or three.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.600
-Will you join us?
-I'm coming.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.520
The referee has entered the field.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.080
Let's go. Go, Leo.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.320
Yes!

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.000
-All right!
-Dancing time. Ready?

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.520
All right! Well done!

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.680
You're fast.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.080
He's so talented.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.000
-Get it in there!
-You're so good!

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.120
-No!
-Yes.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.120
Yes!

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.400
You've reached Max.
Please leave a message.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.560
Hi, Max. It's Cecilie.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.480
I'd like to withdraw the custody case.
I've changed my mind.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.480
I'll pay for your time, of course.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.440
But have them withdraw the case.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.680
Thanks. Bye.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.840
He's flying!

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.840
-Let's go.
-He does a feint.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.200
Nice save, Leo!

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.040
"Fast as lightning, the snow owl Ulla
flies away from the polar bear."

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.120
-It's over there.
-Yes, that's right.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.160
"She flies high up in the blue sky.
The sun is shining, but Ulla isn't happy."

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.120
Look.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.440
Yes, look at that.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.080
Love Mom.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.720
Sweetheart. What was your mother thinking?

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.000
Hey, there are pictures.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.680
-Look what I have for you.
-Wow, it looks delicious.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.440
What's this? Did you get some chocolate?

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.600
-Wow, I get a whole one?
-Look at me.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.400
-Leo…
-You're such a rascal.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.560
Honey, can she try
a tiny piece of bacon? Just to humor me?

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.040
A tiny bite, if she wants to.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.480
-Don't pressure her.
-All right, honey.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.760
Taste the world's greatest invention.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.320
Yes.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.200
Yummy.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.280
That's Daddy's girl.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.120
I'm sorry…

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.840
Now I've made it a bit too formal.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.640
I wanted to say a few words.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.280
I've always been kind of…

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.680
And then I met you, and you're more like…

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.000
And then I had a child that was…

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.600
And you had a child that was more like…

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.560
And then we learned that yours
was actually mine, and mine was yours.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.360
And then I got confused.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400
Now we're here.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.960
And I'm not just…

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.280
-And you're not just…
-No.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.520
Nobody is.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.960
We're all just people.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.440
Honey…

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.160
So I'm sorry.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.040
That was beautiful, Cecilie.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.120
Really beautiful.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.320
That must be the grocery delivery.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.600
I'll get that.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.200
-Hi, Max.
-Hi, Cecilie.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.080
The door was open, so…
I've tried to reach you.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.920
-Did you get my message?
-I couldn't hear it.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.720
There was a lot of noise,
but if you said what I think you did,

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.000
then we can't just call it off, can we?
Just like that.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.880
-The papers are filed.
-But, Max--

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.320
Need help with the groceries? Hi, Max.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.760
Hi, Andreas. Sorry to intrude
on a Saturday, but it couldn't wait.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.880
Right.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.120
As I was telling Cecilie,

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.720
about your custody case…

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.880
Custody case?

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.560
We can't just drop it.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.520
The papers were submitted
to the Agency of Family Law.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.560
What?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.320
A custody case?

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.920
Regarding Sille?

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.480
-Seriously? Cecilie?
-What the hell are you thinking?

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.280
I didn't know
you all still lived together.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.760
How nice.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.400
I'll scoot off and let you sort this out.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.920
-Call me, Cecilie.
-I'll call you.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.080
Have a nice Saturday.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.640
Have you lost your mind?

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.360
That long speech you just gave
was all just lies?

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.120
No, it wasn't. I meant every word of it.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.160
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.
I regretted it, and I told Max.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.120
What are you doing? I don't understand.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.720
Liv, I can't stand
the way you're raising Sille.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.120
I think you're ruining her.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.000
You're doing the opposite
of what I think is best.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.800
As if you know what's best
when it comes to being a parent.

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.520
You're probably the world's worst mom!

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.840
Am I? You have so many rules
and restrictions for Sille.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.600
It would drive anyone totally nuts.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.360
Rules for food. Rules for toys.
Even for the fucking carbon footprint!

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.920
-Yes, because they're healthy rules!
-You tell everyone to be open-minded.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.880
But you're so narrow-minded.
You act all holy and balanced.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.040
Your way is the only right way.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.080
-Yes, because it is.
-You know what?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.320
You've pushed me over the edge

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.800
with your hippie rules,
pseudo lifestyle, and all that nonsense!

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.120
I'm so sick of your crap!

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.000
Fine. We'll just move out, then.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:05.920
Okay.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.360
If we're so terrible to live with,
we'll just move out, right?

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.760
What? Yes, of course.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.520
No, Liv. Let's try to be friends.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.440
Things were going so well.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.120
For the children.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.080
Mom!

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.360
Sille-bug.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.560
Come here.

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:30.760
Yes.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.200
Mom.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.680
Fine, Cecilie. You win.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.680
-What?
-You win!

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.120
You can have your biological child,
and we'll take ours. We'll switch.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.400
What?

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.760
-We'll go pack.
-But…

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.400
-Our lawyer will be in touch.
-Liv, we have to find a solution.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.800
Come here, Sille.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.520
You'll have to make do with me
until you get your real mom.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.840
-Malte…
-See you, Leo, honey.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.760
Enjoy him while you can.
You won't see any of us again after this.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.880
Come on, Malte!

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.320
Malte?

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.120
There must be
something you can do, dammit!

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.600
It's Liv's decision.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.160
So we have to give up Leo?
That's not going to happen.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.400
-There's nothing we can do.
-Cecilie!

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.520
She's legally entitled to him.
She gave birth to him.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.280
Damn it, I refuse to believe it!

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.560
We'll be back
with a moving van as soon as possible.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.480
Malte, where will you go?

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.360
You've rented out your allotment house.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.280
We'll just have to stay with Ulla.
Fantastic.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.400
It can't end like this, Malte.
There must be something we can do.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.560
It's too late.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.400
This is just too bad.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.720
Time to sleep.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.720
Mom…

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.880
I miss Sille.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.640
Yes.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.000
I miss her too.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.720
How can you not have Netflix?
Or at least any TV channel?

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.720
I never watch TV.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.560
Would you like
some more root vegetables, Malte?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.080
Or some lingonberry juice?

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.720
No, thank you, Ulla. I'm good.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.240
This is so nice.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.200
You can stay as long as you want.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.240
Mom!

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.720
Mom!

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.440
What's up, sweetie? Still can't sleep?

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.200
There, there, sweetie.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:06.840
Sleep.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.640
Right, sweetie.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.480
You're telling me now
you can't pick her up?

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.240
Actually, I can.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.360
Since Cecilie can't do it,
I have to do both drop-off and pick-up,

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.880
since you're so busy.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.640
God forbid you support my career,
now it's finally going well.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.920
I want Leo.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.200
Yes, honey.
We're going to see Leo in daycare now.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.320
Not everybody loves their job
so much they forget everything else.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.880
That's enough.
You're starting to sound like my mom!

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.440
-I'm what?
-Yes.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.760
It feels like
you're trying to hold me down.

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280
I can't take it!

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.240
Why can't you be happy for me?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.080
-Liv, come on. It's just--
-No!

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.280
Come on!

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.520
-It's probably for the best.
-Sille!

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.120
Now you'll finally get a child
that's more like you, right?

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.560
Mom, I have to go.
I can't use the phone at daycare.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.760
-I see--
-Jesus Christ…

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.160
Hey.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.200
Malte.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.640
See you soon, Leo.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.000
I mean…

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.560
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.120
I hear Leo is switching daycare this fall?

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.040
I didn't see that coming.
Or perhaps I misunderstood something?

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.760
If you ask me, you should just get started

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.000
because you have so much to offer.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.280
-Let me know if you need investors.
-I'm so glad to hear you say that, Louise.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.000
-Of course.
-Thank you so much.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.760
No, thank you.
Now I can play tennis again.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.920
That's great. Go for it.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.600
-See you.
-See you, Louise. Bye.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.880
What was that about?

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.480
Mom.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.800
I've decided to open my own clinic.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.280
I've dreamt about it
for a long time, and, well…

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.560
I hope you'll support me.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.040
Well, if it's your dream,
of course I won't stand in your way,

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:46.160
although I'm a little hurt
you don't want to do it with me anymore.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.320
Well, it is.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.120
It's my dream.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.320
And I'm going to contact my dad.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.400
No, Liv. That's a bad idea.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.640
-You'll be disappointed.
-That may very well be, Mom.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.520
But I'll regret it
if I don't at least try.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.240
I found out where he works.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.320
Honey, I…

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.080
I might have…

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.120
What?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.440
Well, Poul and I both might have had
a say in how things played out.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.520
What are you saying?

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.920
He does want to see me?

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.880
It's not that simple.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.240
He was obsessed with his career
and couldn't find the time.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.960
-So you didn't want to share me?
-Not with a man who didn't deserve it.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.520
He didn't deserve you!

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.720
I was just trying to protect you.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.640
Yes.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.360
But I'm not a little girl anymore.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.640
And I want to get to know my dad.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.800
See you, Mom.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.160
-Hi again.
-Hi.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.360
I need to speak to Poul.

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.440
-Right now, please.
-Yes.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.800
Of course. Follow me.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.800
Right.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.120
Right, but if you could… Yes?

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.920
Excuse me, Poul. You have a visitor.
I think it's important.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.680
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.880
-Yes?
-Yes, I'm sorry.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.680
I'm…

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.400
A very ambitious intern?

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.400
No.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.600
I'm your daughter.

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.960
Liv?

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.640
I'm sorry it ended the way it did, Liv.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.240
But we were so young.

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:01.560
I was a young, ambitious nerd,
who wanted a career.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.520
Did you have to choose
between work and family?

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.440
Ulla thought I did
because of how ambitious I was.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.080
I dreamt about starting this business.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.960
I dreamt about success.
Doing something good in the world.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.320
I try to do that with this company.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.880
But Ulla couldn't accept that.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.880
But that's not her fault.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:29.000
Of course I should have insisted
and done what was best for you.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.480
I'll just have to live with that. Yes.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.280
So…

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.240
you never had a family?

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.720
Yes.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.200
I did.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.120
It took a few years,
but then I found a woman.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.760
And with her,
the work-life balance worked out.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.280
I learned how to communicate
my needs clearly.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.640
While also taking hers
into consideration, of course.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.400
And I had two kids.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.400
Philippa and Elliott.
They're 20 and 17 years old.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:10.320
So you have two half-siblings, Liv.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.440
And I often imagined how great it would be

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.720
if the three of you had each other.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.680
But maybe it's not entirely too late?

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.200
If I should be so lucky
that you can forgive me, then…

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.800
maybe we could start fresh.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.480
Maybe.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.440
I always hated being an only child.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.720
Liv, I…

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.280
I hope you believe me,
when I tell you that…

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.760
the greatest regret in my life
is not watching you grow up.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.880
Christ…

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Dad.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.320
There you are.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.600
Mom says everything's gone south.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.400
She thinks it's for the best,
since you get to keep Sille.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.040
It's a mess. A big mess, Dad.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.160
What are you doing?

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.200
-Gardening, I think.
-I see.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.480
It's funny seeing you like this.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.480
It almost looks like…

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.760
-Is that me?
-Yes.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:09.960
You were quite the wild toddler.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.120
Uncontrollable. And a hothead.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.480
-Dad, I've never seen this before.
-No.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.320
Your mom hid them.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.160
She didn't like me taking photos

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.960
before you'd taken a bath,
or when you were too wild.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.200
She had a hard time accepting
that you weren't like her.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.040
Sound familiar?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:35.640
So I made this extra album

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:40.760
in case you need to be reminded
of your inner rascal.

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.600
See here…

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.080
-Look at that.
-No!

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.760
-It's like looking at Leo.
-Absolutely.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.720
When did I become such a nice girl?

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.680
I suppose it wasn't
until after Mette-Line came along.

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.440
Look.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.080
-Oh…
-Yes.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.200
-Oh…
-You were so proud of your sister.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.240
You found great joy in each other.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.760
I have to go, Dad.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.840
Someone's had second thoughts.
Back with their tail between their legs.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.560
No, you wish. I just need to talk to Max.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.960
But, Cecilie, we can discuss your return.
Maybe just part-time?

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.200
No, thanks, Jan.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.960
-Hi, Cecilie.
-Max, I need your help.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.560
I don't understand…
You decided not to do it, right?

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.240
Yes, we need to stop the custody case.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.160
Okay. I'm on it.
Cecilie, I've got it covered.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.560
Thank you.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.480
-There's something else as well.
-Yes?

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.960
Do you also specialize in property law?

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.640
Yes, I do.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.680
Do you always kiss your realtors?

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.640
Only the cutest and the best ones.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.200
See you!

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.160
-I've--
-I want to--

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.280
-Can we talk?
-Sure.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.480
-Liv, I just--
-I can't stand living with you!

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.680
I thought I was so damn open-minded.
But I'm not at all, am I?

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.720
I'm domineering and manipulative.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.760
-I want to decide everything!
-Yes, but I'm worse.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.040
I do everything to oppress my son.
I'm training him like a poodle.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.480
Sit properly. Eat and behave properly!

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.600
I'm so hysterical I won't even
let my own daughter develop naturally.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.040
I won't let her use
the left side of her brain at all.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.800
I'm such a bad mom that I want to switch
my son for a miniature version of myself!

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:30.040
I'm the bad mom!

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.760
I'm willing to trade my daughter
because I feel left out.

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.440
Because she is so fucking like you!

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.040
It's been so hard

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.880
not being able to connect with Leo.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:52.880
It's not his fault.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.280
I've been under so much pressure,
running on an empty tank.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.320
He's sensed that.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.360
I'm sorry, Liv.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.920
I don't know what I was thinking
with that custody case.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.960
I'm sorry.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.760
I should probably apologize as well.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.440
I'm sorry that I didn't give you
any space with Sille.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.080
You're as much her mom as I am.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I just needed to get used to it.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.000
I can't do without Leo, either.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.440
And those two kids shouldn't be
without each other. They are sort of…

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.400
-Siblings?
-Yes.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:49.680
In the most crazy, alternative way.

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:54.920
Yes.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.400
Christ…

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.040
The daycare.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.520
-You finally made it.
-Hi. Sorry.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.320
When you can't show up on time,
I have to call your husbands.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.280
Damn it, Liv.

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.800
Stop, Malte. Can you please
not make me feel bad right now?

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.680
Liv, how hard can it be
to prioritize Sille and our family?

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.160
-Honey, can we talk?
-What?

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:23.280
-Can we… Come here.
-Hi, sweetie.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.200
Come on.

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.880
-Honey, seriously.
-I know. I'm sorry.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.240
What is it?

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.840
I spoke with my dad today.

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.640
He said it's important
to communicate your needs, so…

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:44.520
I know I said I wanted to work less,
but honestly, Malte…

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.440
I feel like the worst mom saying this.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.920
Maternity leave was boring as hell.

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.920
-You've never told me that.
-No, because I was ashamed.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.000
I love Sille with all my heart.

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.160
I really do.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:05.160
But it feels wonderful to go to work
and forget all about parenting.

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.440
I'm damn great at what I do.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.400
I feel like I'm making a difference.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.280
I need to be more than someone's mom.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.760
Is it okay for me to feel that?

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.680
Of course it is.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.080
Thank you.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.920
I also want to open my own clinic,
so I'll be extra busy for a while.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.280
Of course, you should do that.
That's so great for you.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.080
And it might be nice
to have some distance from your mom.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.880
-Yes.
-Especially if I sound like her.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.480
But how will we do it
if we're both working so much?

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.000
I might have a solution.

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.040
What do you think?

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.600
Wow, Cecilie. A house? It's very nice.

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.000
Not just one house.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.800
Not just one house.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.560
Two houses.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.720
Here. Go play over there, okay?

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.960
This is the plot I had trouble selling

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.480
because of the two very different houses.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.720
The owner's aunt lived in the guest house,
which is not everyone's cup of tea.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.760
But I found it quite charming.
And I figured you might like it.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.400
I was just waiting for the right buyer.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:10.840
One who needed a house like this…
And a house like this…

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.320
It might be presumptuous, but I bought it.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.440
What?

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.080
I've had the plot divided into two deeds.
One in each of the children's names, so…

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.680
Sille, you're actually
the owner of that little blue house.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.200
-I want the big one!
-Sure you do.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.800
And Leo?

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.680
-This is your house.
-Nice, right?

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.200
We'll be living close to each other,
but under separate roofs.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.360
-How do you feel about that?
-I must admit it's tempting.

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.320
We wouldn't have to look
at your ugly designer furniture.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.080
And we'd get rid
of your nauseating incense

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.440
and insufferable monk music.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:54.720
I wouldn't have to smell your nasty meat
and your decorative pillows.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.280
I can't wait to not deal
with those curtains that you walk into.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.200
Andreas, let's take one of the houses
and they can take the other

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.640
so we don't have to listen to them.

01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.360
Malte, that's an excellent idea.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.920
-What about the kids?
-We could do a week on, week off.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.760
Supposedly, it's very modern.

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:19.360
You have both kids for seven days
and then seven days with no kids or…?

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:22.720
-That's a great idea.
-I want Sille on her birthday.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.040
Fine, then we have her on Christmas Eve.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.040
No, we should spend Christmas together.

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:30.240
We'd love to! But our kids eat duck
on Christmas Eve.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.440
We'll go all in. I'm making roast pork.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.760
No! My kids are not eating pork rinds.

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:37.120
You know pigs have blackheads, right?

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:40.760
-Liv, potato!
-No, Cecilie.

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.840
You're not using "potato" right.
You can't use it like that.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.600
Sure you can!

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:18.480
-There are other options.
-Like what?

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.920
You could have sex all over again.

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.600
-I need to sleep.
-Come on, honey.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.400
No, honey. I don't have the energy.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:31.680
I'm sorry!

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.920
I'll drag them through media hell
and then I'll fu…

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.520
Seriously? "I'll fuck them!"

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.480
I'll drag them through media hell
and crush them so hard

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.800
that they won't recognize
their own assholes.

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.360
Wow.

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:54.840
Gunslinger.

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:58.920
I don't mean real sleeping pills.
I mean sleeping pills for children.

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:04.480
Why are you naked, Andreas?

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.800
What do you mean? I'm wearing underwear.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.880
-Why are you not wearing clothes?
-I didn't want my clothes to get greasy.

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.040
-Damn it, Mille.
-Sorry, I'll leave.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.400
-Come in here and do it properly.
-Okay.

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.960
-You need to relax.
-No, I don't have the energy right now.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.040
It's so crazy to watch you
get pulled back like that.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.440
I'm much worse than you.
I do everything to oppress my son…

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.520
We're training him as if he were a poodle.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:45.200
Yes! Yes, you are. Or…
Your turn. Say something.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.840
No, honey. I don't have the energy.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.720
Let's rewind.

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.480
I think it's time we stop.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.680
It was me.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.920
-That was a fart.
-The world's biggest fart.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.520
Who was it? Who'll confess?

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.440
-It was me.
-It was me!

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.600
