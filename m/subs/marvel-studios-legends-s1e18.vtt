THOR: <i>It's a long story,</i>
<i>but basically I'm a bit of a hero.</i>

00:35.618 --> 00:37.162
<i>See, I spent some time on Earth...</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:41.416
<i>fought some robots,</i>
<i>saved the planet a couple of times.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:43.960
Get it off.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.464
<i>And I went searching for some</i>
<i>magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:50.759
What did you do?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.385
<i>What'd you do?</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:56.014
<i>That's when I came across</i>
<i>a path of death and destruction.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:02.896
But who are you?

01:05.106 --> 01:06.107
Really?

01:09.694 --> 01:12.113
-I am ready, Father.
-So am I.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.242
Only one of you can ascend to the throne.

01:17.327 --> 01:21.081
<i>A wise king never seeks out war.</i>

01:22.582 --> 01:26.544
THOR: <i>The Jotuns must learn to fear me,</i>
<i>just as they once feared you.</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:29.839
You have betrayed
the express command of your king.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.801
You're unworthy!

01:36.012 --> 01:38.181
I now take from you your power!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.934
In the name of my father

01:42.393 --> 01:44.104
and his father before,

01:44.813 --> 01:47.524
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

01:49.859 --> 01:51.319
(SCREAMING)

Do me a favor and don't be dead.

(GROANS)

01:58.743 --> 02:00.745
You're no match for the Mighty...

02:02.539 --> 02:03.581
Another!

02:04.457 --> 02:06.126
-I need a horse!
-Where are you going?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.627
To get what belongs to me.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
LOKI: <i>So cruel to put the hammer</i>
<i>within your reach,</i>

02:11.422 --> 02:13.049
<i>knowing that you could never lift it.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:15.176
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.388
THOR: My father
was trying to teach me something,

02:18.471 --> 02:19.973
but I was too stupid to see it.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.393
Ensure my brother does not return.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.312
THOR: <i>Taking their lives</i>
<i>will gain you nothing.</i>

02:26.396 --> 02:27.438
So take mine.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.149
-(GROANS)
-No.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.529
-You're safe.
-We're safe.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.615
-It's over.
-No.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.495
Whosoever holds this hammer,

02:42.871 --> 02:46.082
if he be worthy,
shall possess the power of Thor.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.796
Oh. My. God.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.342
I will return for you.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.223
<i>When I first came to Earth,</i>

03:02.807 --> 03:04.392
<i>Loki's rage followed me here.</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:07.937
<i>And your people paid the price.</i>

03:08.438 --> 03:10.273
Kneel!

03:11.900 --> 03:12.942
And now, again.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.946
You think you could make Loki
tell us where the Tesseract is?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.365
LOKI: <i>There's no stopping it.</i>

03:19.991 --> 03:23.745
-There is only the war.
-So be it.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.376
Look at this. Look around you!

03:31.211 --> 03:33.171
-ROMANOFF: How do we do this?
-As a team.

ODIN: <i>You'll spend the rest</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:51.648
LOKI: And what of Thor?

03:52.565 --> 03:55.443
<i>Thor must strive to undo</i>
<i>the damage you have done.</i>

03:56.402 --> 03:58.446
<i>He will bring order to the Nine Realms,</i>
<i>and then,</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:00.281
he will be king.

04:02.951 --> 04:03.993
(GROANS)

04:06.454 --> 04:08.164
THOR: <i>Father, I cannot be King of Asgard.</i>

04:09.290 --> 04:13.878
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

04:13.962 --> 04:15.713
but I cannot do so from that chair.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.591
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.842
BANNER: <i>Ultron.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:21.636
How were you guys planning
on beating that?

04:21.719 --> 04:22.762
Together.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.138
You said you were coming back.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.099
THOR: <i>I had to put an end</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:30.895
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.984
<i>I believe that fate brought us together.</i>

-Hela.

Your sister.

I am going to stop her.

-HELA: <i>Tell me, Brother.</i>
-(GROANS)

05:37.837 --> 05:40.214
What were you the god of again?

05:40.506 --> 05:44.135
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.554
It was never your source of strength.

(THOR YELLING)

06:01.152 --> 06:02.653
What have I done?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.448
You saved us from extinction.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.907
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

06:47.990 --> 06:50.326
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.203
Bring me Thanos!

<i>Thanos is just the latest</i>
<i>of a long line of bastards,</i>

06:56.874 --> 07:00.586

What are we drinking?

You have the little one.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.653
My grandfather, many years ago,

08:48.736 --> 08:52.156
had to hide the stone
from the dark elves.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.325
Ooh! (LAUGHS)

08:54.408 --> 08:56.953
Scary beings.
So, Jane, actually...

08:57.745 --> 08:59.455
There she is.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.959
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

09:03.834 --> 09:07.296
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.132
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.426
And she became very, very sick.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.222
And so I had to take her to Asgard,
which is where I'm from...

09:16.806 --> 09:20.476
Oh, you know, Jane and I
aren't even dating anymore, so...

09:20.560 --> 09:22.395
Yes, these things happen though. You know?

09:22.478 --> 09:24.438
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

09:24.522 --> 09:26.607
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.235
The only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence.

09:29.860 --> 09:30.861
Awesome.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.156
-Eggs? Breakfast?
-No, I'd like a Bloody Mary.
