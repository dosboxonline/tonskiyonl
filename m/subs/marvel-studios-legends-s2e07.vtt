(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:32.198 --> 00:33.408
(GRUNTS)

00:35.493 --> 00:39.122
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

00:39.622 --> 00:41.124
The result of illegal genetic

00:41.207 --> 00:42.625
and cybernetic experiments

00:42.709 --> 00:43.918
-on a lower life form.
-(SPITS)

00:45.336 --> 00:46.463
Stop it!

00:46.546 --> 00:48.339
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

00:48.423 --> 00:51.342
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

00:51.426 --> 00:53.428
-That is true!
-He has no respect!

00:53.511 --> 00:54.679
That is also true.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.140
I didn't ask to get made!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.851
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

00:59.934 --> 01:03.605
and put back together, over and over
and turned into some... (INHALES)

01:04.439 --> 01:05.774
Some little monster!

01:05.857 --> 01:09.235
-Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.
-He called me "vermin"!

01:09.986 --> 01:11.696
She called me "rodent"!

01:14.783 --> 01:16.493
(SOBS)

01:16.868 --> 01:18.036
(SNIFFS)

01:23.166 --> 01:24.167
(ROCKET SIGHS)

01:29.756 --> 01:31.966
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.468
(YELLING)

01:34.719 --> 01:36.429
All right. All right. I'm sorry.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.264
-(LAUGHS)
-No, wait!

01:41.351 --> 01:42.352
What am I looking at?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.898
PETER: Rocket has escaped 22 prisons.

01:46.981 --> 01:47.982
Oh, we're getting out.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.737
-Oh, yeah.
-That was a pretty good plan.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.365
ROCKET: You got the orb, right?
GAMORA: Yes.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.494
I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

01:59.577 --> 02:01.246
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

02:01.329 --> 02:03.081
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.415
ROCKET: Are you kidding me?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.127
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

02:07.210 --> 02:08.711
PETER: So he can destroy the galaxy?

02:08.795 --> 02:11.047
ROCKET: Come on, Groot.
Ronan has the Stone.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.465
I have a plan.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.218
First of all, you're copying me from
when I said I had a plan.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.096
I have part of a plan!

02:19.722 --> 02:23.643
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.562
Quill! Yondu! Now!

02:26.980 --> 02:28.064
Rocket, hurry!

02:29.190 --> 02:33.528
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.533
There's one more thing we need
to complete the plan.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.743
That guy's eye.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.706
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need
that guy's eye.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.792
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me. (GIGGLES)

02:49.169 --> 02:50.378
DRAX: What are they called again?

02:50.545 --> 02:52.213
ROCKET: Anulax batteries.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.090
Rocket, get it to look up.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.009
Sovereign hired us to protect them.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.553
They told me you people
were conceited douchebags.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.471
But that isn't true at all.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.016
That was meant to be behind your back.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.436
This is weird. We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.520
GAMORA: Why would they do that?

03:07.604 --> 03:09.272
DRAX: Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.982
What were you thinking?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.901
Dude, they were really easy to steal.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.070
DRAX: To make it, you'd have to be
the greatest pilot in the universe.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.198
-Lucky for us, I...
-I am.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.872
PETER: What is your goal here?

03:26.998 --> 03:30.084
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.674
YONDU: We've got ourselves
a pretty good little gig here.

03:37.425 --> 03:40.094
This golden gal offered us a large sum

03:40.178 --> 03:43.264
to deliver you and your pals over to her
because she wants to kill ya.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.267
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.021
-Rocket. Ego's unhinged.
-(GROANS)

03:50.104 --> 03:52.482
So we're saving the galaxy again? Awesome.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.442
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

03:54.525 --> 03:55.526
For the bomb to work,

03:55.610 --> 03:58.613
we'd actually need
to place it on Ego's core.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.574
All right, push this button.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.453
Now whatever you do,
don't push this button

04:05.787 --> 04:06.871
because that will set off

04:06.955 --> 04:09.374
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.376
-I am Groot.
-No!

04:11.668 --> 04:13.419
That's the button
that will kill everyone.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.255
Whee!

04:15.546 --> 04:16.631
We're all gonna die.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.342
How long till the bomb goes off?

04:19.425 --> 04:23.096
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't
kill us all, about six minutes.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.180
Get to the ship!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.515
Not without you.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.141
You need to give me this.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.060
GAMORA: Rocket, where is he?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.187
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.981
YONDU: I know everything about you.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.109
I know you play like you're
the meanest and the hardest,

04:36.192 --> 04:37.777
but actually
you're the most scared of all.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.861
ROCKET: Shut up!

04:38.945 --> 04:41.197
YONDU: I know you push away
anyone who's willing to put up with you

04:41.281 --> 04:44.284
'cause just a little bit of love
reminds you how big

04:44.367 --> 04:46.995
and empty that hole inside you
actually is.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.746
-I said shut up.
-I know them scientists

04:48.830 --> 04:51.416
what made you never give
a rat's ass about you.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.500
ROCKET: I'm serious.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.337
YONDU: I know who you are, boy,
because you're me.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.589
I am Groot.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.674
What's that?

04:59.757 --> 05:03.928
He says, "Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy."

05:04.012 --> 05:05.763
Only he didn't use "frickin'."

05:06.472 --> 05:09.559
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

05:09.642 --> 05:12.520
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

05:12.729 --> 05:14.272
-Yeah, I'll go.
-Wonderful!

05:14.355 --> 05:17.066
-Uh, except for that I'm the captain.
-THOR: Quiet.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.154
PETER: For the record...

05:21.404 --> 05:24.240
I know that you're going with him
because it's where Thanos isn't.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.701
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.247
This Thanos we're talking about,
he's the toughest there is.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.500
If I'm wrong, then...

05:36.294 --> 05:37.503
what more could I lose?

05:39.172 --> 05:42.050
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.598
(YELLS) Come and get some, space dogs!

05:50.183 --> 05:52.894
Come on! Get some! Get some!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.104
Come on! Get some!

05:55.229 --> 05:57.106
-How much for the gun?
-Not for sale.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.525
Okay. How much for the arm?

06:01.694 --> 06:02.904
Oh, I'll get that arm.

06:07.992 --> 06:12.163
When Thanos snapped his fingers,
I lost the only family I ever had.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.957
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

06:15.041 --> 06:16.084
all gone.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.628
-And you can help them.
-Okay.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.171
I think we could bring them back.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.422
ROCKET: You can do this.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.507
Yes, I can.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.217
Oh, yeah!

06:24.384 --> 06:26.928
ROGERS: Whatever it takes.
BARTON: Whatever it takes.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.110
Bucky's arm?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.155
Merry Christmas.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.002
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.087
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.964
Okay, I'll do my best.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.299
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.
