01:57.510 --> 01:59.500
Hiya.

15:50.140 --> 15:51.440
Arthur, it's Harry.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.450
I've been trying to get ahold
of you for three days.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.010
-What's the matter?
-I gotta see you.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.580
Now. Please.

15:59.620 --> 16:02.140
-One hour.
-Arthur, I've got big trouble.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.490
It just doesn't
make any sense, Arthur.

16:14.530 --> 16:17.060
They said I broke the agreement.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
Day before yesterday,
they stopped answering my calls.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.870
What can I do?

16:21.910 --> 16:26.870
Give 'em a call.
Say a few words on my behalf.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.250
I wouldn't know who.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.520
Why should they listen to me?
I'm no part of that.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.000
No, but your father was.
A very important part.

16:43.030 --> 16:46.520
His brains helped put the whole
thing together for 'em.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.660
They still talk about him
like he was a patron saint.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.190
You've got his name.

16:52.740 --> 16:54.210
Please, Arthur?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.570
It's all I've got.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.640
Thanks.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.349
Save it.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.220
Come on outside.
Let's have a drink.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.119
You know,
I've given a good many years.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.490
Me and your father both.

17:15.089 --> 17:18.220
How many friends you think
I got right now, huh?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.560
What?

17:22.599 --> 17:26.000
I was just thinkin'.
Remember that fishin' trip...

17:26.040 --> 17:29.440
that you and me and your father
took up to Canada?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.500
You was about eight, right?

17:31.540 --> 17:34.140
Seven or eight.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.440
You fell overboard.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.850
You couldn't swim.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.910
Your old man says,
"He'll learn pretty fast."

17:39.950 --> 17:43.480
You were floppin' around.
You looked like a drowned rat.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.510
But you didn't say a word.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.320
You didn't yell for help
or nothin'.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.920
You just kept lookin'
at your old man...

17:49.960 --> 17:52.190
and he didn't make a move.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.220
Well, pretty soon
I had to reach out...

17:54.270 --> 17:56.670
and grab you by the hair
and pull you in the boat.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.640
You looked like a drowned rat.

17:58.670 --> 18:03.340
Your old man,
he laughed like hell.

18:03.380 --> 18:07.610
That was a long time ago.

18:09.650 --> 18:10.950
Hey, what are you drinkin'?

18:10.980 --> 18:13.880
We've got vodka...

18:13.920 --> 18:16.980
we got scotch, bourbon.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.950
Arthur, this is my son Steve.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.260
Steve, this is Mr. Bishop.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.700
Hi. How are you?

18:28.730 --> 18:31.260
I need some bread, Dad.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.430
What are you talkin' about?
Why, just this morning I was--

18:33.470 --> 18:35.130
I only need a thousand.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.370
Besides,
my asking you for money...

18:38.410 --> 18:40.740
makes you feel
I'm dependent on you.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.810
Kinda ties us together.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.080
Fast, huh?

18:44.120 --> 18:46.380
Chromosomes will tell.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.080
He's got a point.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.280
My father gets uptight
when I ask him for money...

18:51.320 --> 18:52.450
he steals from other people.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.290
Steve, that's enough.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.750
Don't get excited.
It's bad for you.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.290
Nice to meet you.
Drop by any time, huh?

19:02.340 --> 19:04.460
Any friend of Big Harry's...

19:06.010 --> 19:07.440
I know you gotta go.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.670
I'm sorry about that.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.340
Forget it.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.900
I just don't understand him
anymore.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.970
It's just so...

19:15.010 --> 19:16.980
Well, call me
when you know something, OK

19:17.020 --> 19:18.570
OK.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.880
Take care of yourself.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.610
Arthur Bishop?

20:27.620 --> 20:28.850
I have a special delivery.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.320
Certified. Please sign here.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.500
Mr. Bishop?

23:00.540 --> 23:03.240
We would like you
to go ahead...anytime.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.510
-Nothin' else, huh?
-Nothin' else.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.350
You're to wait down there...

23:20.390 --> 23:23.020
and I wait for you
at the top of the hill.

23:23.060 --> 23:25.460
Well, could you tell anything
by his voice?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.160
I mean the tone?

23:27.200 --> 23:30.570
Harry, stay loose.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.300
Yeah, sure.

23:34.240 --> 23:37.300
It's like you say, if they're
willin' to talk, well...

23:39.750 --> 23:42.440
Harry, I'll be parked
right up there.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.780
Say, don't you think that...

24:17.650 --> 24:20.050
Hello?!

24:29.160 --> 24:32.320
Well, I'm here!

24:36.800 --> 24:39.000
Come on, let's talk.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.340
You said we were gonna talk!

24:56.960 --> 24:59.860
Harry, run to the car.

24:59.890 --> 25:03.620
-It's a set-up.
-I can't!

25:09.640 --> 25:12.700
I'll try to get behind him.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.600
Run!

25:28.920 --> 25:31.720
Oh, God.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.590
I can't--

25:38.400 --> 25:40.060
Keep going!

25:40.100 --> 25:42.070
I can't.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.950
You?

26:13.530 --> 26:16.470
This is it, huh?

26:20.810 --> 26:23.670
Finish it, Arthur.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.040
You or me.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.670
Finish it.

26:56.340 --> 26:58.870
I had a feeling.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.140
Can I come in?

27:11.690 --> 27:14.180
Oh, my darling,
it's been so long.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.520
I said I wasn't gonna do this.

27:19.570 --> 27:21.620
I had it all worked out.

27:21.670 --> 27:24.400
I go to the door,
there you are.

27:24.440 --> 27:28.630
I smile, very poised,
as if I just saw you yesterday.

27:28.670 --> 27:30.970
I'm sorry.

27:31.010 --> 27:33.240
Nothing's changed.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.870
It never does.

27:38.380 --> 27:42.220
OK, I think
I've got it together.

27:44.290 --> 27:47.690
You know...

27:47.730 --> 27:49.250
I think you've lost some weight.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.660
I wrote you a letter.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.570
I couldn't mail it.

27:59.610 --> 28:01.730
I didn't know where.

28:01.770 --> 28:05.680
I keep moving around.

28:05.710 --> 28:07.200
It's true, you know.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.510
I do always know
when you're near.

28:09.550 --> 28:11.140
ESP.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.880
Maybe.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.890
What's the matter, baby?

28:16.920 --> 28:18.480
Well, I've been here
about three minutes...

28:18.520 --> 28:20.550
and you've managed about
one recrimination a minute.

28:20.590 --> 28:25.500
I can't seem to feel anything
but hurt when you're not here.

28:25.530 --> 28:29.870
I guess when I see you again,
I just have to hurt back.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.640
Did you really
write me a letter?

28:38.840 --> 28:41.440
"My dearest love...

28:41.480 --> 28:42.910
"I'm once again alone."

28:42.950 --> 28:44.210
I can't hear you.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.650
"And the silence in this room...

28:45.680 --> 28:50.020
"presses against my ears
until I'm deafened.

28:50.060 --> 28:53.050
"This is the way I live
until I see you again...

28:53.090 --> 28:56.120
"and then you're here
and there's no past.

28:56.160 --> 28:58.430
"Only the two of us.

28:58.460 --> 29:01.260
"I know these words hurt you...

29:01.300 --> 29:04.100
"because you can't give
anything but the moment...

29:04.140 --> 29:06.540
"but I have to write them now...

29:06.570 --> 29:12.140
"because somehow my need
for you must find its voice.

29:12.180 --> 29:16.710
"And you - what of your pain?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.180
"If you could only
let me have...

29:19.220 --> 29:21.350
"one small part
of the weight of it."

29:22.790 --> 29:24.510
Don't read anymore.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.320
Don't you see?

29:26.360 --> 29:29.120
Even that would be a comfort
to me when you're not here.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.930
Oh, my darling,
I love you so much. I can't --

29:31.960 --> 29:33.660
Don't.
It's gonna be all right.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.070
Oh, baby, I love you.

29:36.100 --> 29:37.690
Oh, my darling.

29:39.910 --> 29:42.740
Darling, take us to bed.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.140
Baby, I missed you.
I'm so glad you're here.

29:46.180 --> 29:48.200
I love you.

29:59.730 --> 30:02.490
It'll be a hundred more
this time.

30:05.730 --> 30:08.030
The letter took me
a while to make up.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.260
All right?

30:13.310 --> 30:18.640
Yes. The letter was good.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.770
Try to think of something
like it for next time.

30:20.810 --> 30:24.040
OK, I will.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.140
To his community and church...

30:29.190 --> 30:33.250
he gave his resources,
his faith, and his spirit.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.850
His good works comfort us
in the going.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.830
We commit his remains
to your earth, O, Father...

30:39.870 --> 30:43.700
and we pray you
vouchsafe him eternal life.

30:43.740 --> 30:46.230
I've always been interested
in primitive rituals...

30:46.270 --> 30:49.400
Like tucking the dead away.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.340
Glory be to the Father
and to the Son...

30:53.380 --> 30:55.440
and to the Holy Spirit.

30:55.480 --> 31:00.180
Glory be to the father,
Harry McKenna...

31:00.220 --> 31:02.240
fixer extraordinaire...

31:02.290 --> 31:07.750
pusher, pimp, thief, arsonist.

31:07.790 --> 31:09.760
You liked him a lot?

31:09.800 --> 31:13.290
Oh, yeah.
He was my kind of man.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.560
What was your connection
with him?

31:16.600 --> 31:20.470
He worked for my father
a long time back.

31:20.510 --> 31:23.030
He thought I could
do him a favor.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.240
So, your old man was in, huh?

31:26.280 --> 31:29.480
And you?

31:29.510 --> 31:32.010
Don't you think you should be...

31:34.550 --> 31:36.080
Yeah, you got somethin' goin'.

31:36.120 --> 31:40.490
You're pretty sure of yourself.

31:40.530 --> 31:43.890
I live in my mind, Mr. Bishop.

31:43.930 --> 31:45.920
Sounds like something
I read someplace.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
And so do you.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.360
Could I have a ride home?

31:53.640 --> 31:55.270
Sure.

32:03.450 --> 32:05.680
Amen.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.570
Come on. Steve's got
the whole place outside.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.660
Good old Steve!

32:28.240 --> 32:30.800
What are they celebrating?

32:30.840 --> 32:33.370
Well, this is all mine now.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.350
My father never really
liked my friends...

32:43.390 --> 32:45.120
and I'm not so sure I do,
either.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.790
Hey, we've got a call here
from Katmandu.

32:48.830 --> 32:51.390
Hey, Katmandu's calling, Sam.

32:54.230 --> 32:57.220
Yes, I placed a call
to Sydney, Australia.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.330
We got the White House.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.280
Yes, I want to speak--

33:14.850 --> 33:16.720
Yeah. No, listen, I live there.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.050
I know he's there.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.080
It's all in the bubbles.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.220
Yeah, emergency.
I must speak to him. John Lenn--

33:29.430 --> 33:31.370
Hey, Steve,
Louise is on the phone.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.730
Sounds important, man.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.340
-Afghanistan here.
-No, I didn't call Afghanistan.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.010
-Hello, Louise?
-Are you with her?

33:45.150 --> 33:47.620
-You don't love me.
-That kinda talk is foolish.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.240
I'm gonna kill myself.
I wanna die.

33:49.290 --> 33:51.380
-Louise, please.
-I do.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.820
-Well, go ahead then.
-I will. You don't care.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.260
Yeah, that's right.
I don't care.

33:56.290 --> 33:57.730
Right--

33:57.760 --> 34:00.390
My friends are so happy,
they're killing themselves.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.070
Would you come along?

34:29.230 --> 34:31.090
Who's he?

34:31.130 --> 34:32.760
He's a friend of the family's.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.270
I thought
you'd already started.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.860
Oh, no.
I wanted you to watch.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.960
Now, let me see
if I've got everything.

34:41.010 --> 34:45.670
Ice cubes, wine, razor blades.

34:45.710 --> 34:49.010
How long does it take?

34:49.050 --> 34:50.449
I don't know.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.510
Sure you do.
You know everything.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.420
Louise,
you called me because...

34:57.460 --> 35:00.980
either you don't want to do it,
and you want me to stop you...

35:01.030 --> 35:03.290
or you want to lay
the guilt of it on me...

35:03.330 --> 35:04.890
and I'm not buying either one.

35:04.930 --> 35:09.130
So go ahead on.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.630
Hold on.

35:14.870 --> 35:18.470
Mind if I have
a little wine first?

35:18.510 --> 35:20.570
You son of a bitch.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.470
Mr. Bishop?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.180
Not for me, thanks.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.720
You really don't believe.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.550
Baby.

35:32.590 --> 35:37.150
I call you baby because
your innocence touches me so.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.240
Those really are sharp,
aren't they?

36:05.890 --> 36:09.290
I always said
that you had guts, Louise.

36:09.330 --> 36:12.690
About how long will it take?

36:12.730 --> 36:14.820
Mr. Bishop?

36:14.870 --> 36:16.770
How much do you weigh?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.030
110.

36:20.810 --> 36:23.540
Two and a half to three hours.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.170
At first you'll get cold,
and then sleepy.

36:27.650 --> 36:30.410
You're a son of a bitch, too.

36:30.450 --> 36:33.380
Louise, I haven't had
anything to eat yet today.

36:33.420 --> 36:34.850
What you got in the fridge?

36:39.220 --> 36:41.160
Thanks.

36:43.430 --> 36:47.890
I know he'll stop me.

36:47.930 --> 36:49.920
I know he will.

36:49.970 --> 36:54.740
I know he feels something.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.280
I know you.

37:10.290 --> 37:11.480
What?

37:12.720 --> 37:15.850
I didn't hear you, baby.
What'd you say?

37:15.890 --> 37:18.520
I said you'll stop it.

37:18.560 --> 37:22.120
Listen.
If you don't care anything...

37:22.170 --> 37:24.030
about your own life,
then why should I?

37:24.070 --> 37:28.270
You do care. You do.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.710
And you do, too.

37:35.410 --> 37:38.350
I'm cold.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.380
I'm getting colder.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.950
I'm cold.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.460
Psychosomatic.

37:47.490 --> 37:50.090
You've got an hour
and a half left.

37:50.130 --> 37:51.460
Please, Steve.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.120
I don't want to do it.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.270
If you kick it...

38:01.310 --> 38:03.070
you can probably make
the sheriff's station...

38:03.110 --> 38:06.200
in Malibu
in about fifteen minutes.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.400
Would you have let it happen?

38:38.440 --> 38:42.400
Would you?
Look, I was just an observer.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.210
You haven't answered
my question.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.050
Well, what do you think?

38:46.080 --> 38:48.880
We'll never know, will we?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.790
Well, say
that I just sat there...

38:51.820 --> 38:54.720
or we just sat there
and watched her check out.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.250
Think that
would have been crazy?

38:56.290 --> 38:58.190
Irrational, maybe.

38:58.230 --> 38:59.790
Is there anything wrong
with that?

38:59.830 --> 39:02.600
It just means that you
have your own rule book.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.470
I can dig that.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.470
Is that so?

39:09.510 --> 39:11.340
It takes a very special
kind of person...

39:11.380 --> 39:13.900
to pick up the tab
for that kind of living.

39:13.950 --> 39:18.040
You say you dig it,
but you're talkin' about...

39:18.080 --> 39:20.050
something you really
know nothing about.

39:20.090 --> 39:21.780
And you do?

39:21.820 --> 39:25.190
Do I?

39:25.220 --> 39:27.090
Very slippery.

39:27.130 --> 39:30.820
When he's cornered, he answers
questions with questions.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.260
What's your action, Mr. Bishop?

39:33.300 --> 39:36.560
You've been watching
too many late movies.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.330
Well, it's been interesting.

39:38.370 --> 39:41.570
Thanks. Maybe another time.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.140
The underwater feeding show...

40:59.180 --> 41:02.550
by Marineland's staff diver
in the giant fish tank.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.850
The giant fish tank
is to your left...

41:35.450 --> 41:36.890
Next of kin?

41:36.920 --> 41:38.620
None.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.680
Anybody we can notify?

41:42.060 --> 41:44.530
How about an acquaintance?

41:44.560 --> 41:45.790
Are you finished, doctor?

41:45.830 --> 41:47.130
No, there's a charge.

41:47.170 --> 41:49.460
You can take care of it at the
cashier's window one floor up.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.940
I suggest that you make
an appointment with your doctor.

41:51.970 --> 41:55.570
That is, if you have a doctor.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.240
What do you think?

41:58.280 --> 42:00.680
What'd you feel
before you passed out?

42:00.710 --> 42:01.940
Couldn't get my breath.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.910
Palms sweating?

42:04.950 --> 42:06.640
Nausea? Heart beating fast?

42:08.450 --> 42:10.440
Sounds like an A.R.

42:10.490 --> 42:13.460
Acute anxiety reaction.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.120
Classic neurasthenic pattern.

42:15.160 --> 42:19.560
See a doctor, Mr. Bishop.
Have some tests.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.860
If they come back negative...

42:21.900 --> 42:25.060
maybe you should think
about seeing a psychiatrist.

42:25.100 --> 42:26.630
In the meantime, take these.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.040
They'll help a little.

42:29.070 --> 42:31.170
I need a signature, Doc.

42:31.210 --> 42:33.140
Hey, you were really
out there for a while.

42:34.580 --> 42:36.010
The cashier, you say,
is on the first floor?

42:40.750 --> 42:43.850
Dr. Richmond
wanted in Emergency.

42:43.890 --> 42:46.190
Watch your backs, please.

42:46.220 --> 42:47.560
Thank you.

43:34.170 --> 43:37.510
You waitin' for me?

43:37.540 --> 43:40.810
How long you been here?

43:40.850 --> 43:43.710
Since last night, about 12:00.

43:43.750 --> 43:47.410
Must be important.

43:47.450 --> 43:49.980
You said another time.

43:50.020 --> 43:53.010
I said maybe another time.

43:53.060 --> 43:57.260
That's right.
That's what you said.

44:00.060 --> 44:02.330
Come on in.

44:07.370 --> 44:10.770
So this is what it looks like
inside your head, huh?

44:10.810 --> 44:12.540
This place must've cost
some bread.

44:12.580 --> 44:14.370
Are you still trying
to figure my action?

44:15.750 --> 44:18.580
I inherited enough.

44:21.650 --> 44:24.210
It is nice to be comfortable,
isn't it?

44:25.760 --> 44:29.190
Is there something specific
you want to talk about?

44:29.230 --> 44:32.690
No, I just...

44:32.730 --> 44:34.720
Well, yeah, there is.

44:34.770 --> 44:37.740
What happened the other night,
that was pretty far out...

44:37.770 --> 44:39.200
and you were saying
some things about it.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.670
So?

44:40.710 --> 44:42.760
So, how 'bout some answers?

44:42.810 --> 44:44.570
To what?

44:44.610 --> 44:47.810
For openers,
suppose I say I think...

44:47.850 --> 44:49.470
I'm the kind of person...

44:49.510 --> 44:51.880
that can pick up the tab
for what happened?

44:51.920 --> 44:53.750
What's the rest of it?

44:53.790 --> 44:55.980
What makes you think
I can answer that?

44:56.020 --> 44:57.490
You said that--

44:57.520 --> 44:59.990
I said that you didn't know
anything about it.

45:00.020 --> 45:02.080
It doesn't mean I do.

45:03.290 --> 45:05.560
Now you see him, now you don't.

45:07.430 --> 45:09.330
Is my time up?

45:09.370 --> 45:11.560
There is something
I have to do.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.090
Can I come?

45:15.070 --> 45:17.560
What do you want from me?

45:28.050 --> 45:30.080
That's incredible.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.710
Yeah. It keeps me sharp.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.020
Balance,
problems of orientation--

45:34.060 --> 45:35.920
sometimes you have
to think in reverse.

45:41.830 --> 45:43.030
Here, you take it.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.820
That's not bad.

46:00.850 --> 46:02.910
How long you been flying?

46:02.950 --> 46:05.550
About twenty seconds.

46:10.660 --> 46:14.530
My father
was what they called a judge.

46:14.570 --> 46:16.830
He would settle arguments
on the council...

46:16.870 --> 46:18.800
and his word was final.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.700
It was never questioned...

46:20.740 --> 46:23.170
until one day
some hothead from Chicago...

46:23.210 --> 46:25.870
took exception
to one of his decisions...

46:25.910 --> 46:27.880
and put a contract on him.

46:27.910 --> 46:34.320
The guy that got him
was a shooter from Topeka.

46:34.350 --> 46:35.880
That was all.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.390
How old were you then?

46:37.420 --> 46:38.850
Your age.

46:38.890 --> 46:41.690
Maybe younger.
I was still in school.

46:41.730 --> 46:44.420
You find this interesting,
don't you?

46:44.460 --> 46:45.950
Are you kidding?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.990
My father used to do
front numbers even for me.

46:49.030 --> 46:51.300
Like if he did that,
maybe it wouldn't rub off.

46:51.340 --> 46:54.200
Never talk about that stuff.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.670
He was beautiful.

46:55.710 --> 46:59.370
Only trouble was,
I really wanted to dig it.

46:59.410 --> 47:02.850
He wanted me to be
a part of his front, too.

47:09.150 --> 47:11.820
So, what happened
after they burned your old man?

47:11.860 --> 47:13.050
I finished school.

47:13.090 --> 47:14.750
And?

47:14.790 --> 47:16.920
That's all. Then I grew up.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.860
Did your father ever tell you
anything about the operation...

47:18.900 --> 47:20.090
Like how it worked?

47:21.470 --> 47:22.960
What's with those guys, anyway?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.970
They all act
like they're ashamed.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.700
My father wasn't ashamed.
He was the best.

47:48.390 --> 47:49.550
Game.

47:49.590 --> 47:50.790
You're pretty good.

47:53.730 --> 47:57.190
-Play to win, do you?
-You know any other way?

47:57.240 --> 47:59.140
Let's make it two out of three.

47:59.170 --> 48:03.400
OK, but I'm telling you,
I'm genius at this game.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.670
Yeah?
You go get the ball, genius.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.920
What's going on?

48:13.950 --> 48:16.280
That old man is Yamoto.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.910
He's here from Japan,
where he's a master.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.690
The other guy is Kori.

48:22.730 --> 48:25.660
Very dangerous and very fast...

48:25.700 --> 48:27.190
but he's got some new tricks...

48:27.230 --> 48:29.630
that are sort of an insult
to the old style.

48:29.670 --> 48:31.530
Yamoto thinks these tricks...

48:31.570 --> 48:32.970
are useless
against a classic fighter...

48:33.000 --> 48:34.530
and he's here
to prove his point.

48:35.910 --> 48:40.970
The object of these fights is
total concentration and control.

48:41.010 --> 48:43.140
They don't actually
hit each other...

48:43.180 --> 48:45.380
otherwise one or the other
would be dead...

48:45.420 --> 48:48.350
and that's against the law.

49:17.420 --> 49:20.650
I thought he wasn't
supposed to hit him.

49:20.690 --> 49:23.250
Probably
one of Kori's new tricks.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.810
You haven't said three words
since the match.

49:58.660 --> 50:01.220
He practically
murdered that guy.

50:01.260 --> 50:04.230
Murder is only killing
without a license...

50:04.260 --> 50:06.200
and everybody kills.

50:06.230 --> 50:09.200
Governments,
the military, the police.

50:09.230 --> 50:12.960
Do you think
that Yamoto's a killer?

50:13.000 --> 50:15.500
He's a killer who doesn't kill.

50:15.540 --> 50:18.240
It's funny.

50:19.280 --> 50:23.270
For him,
the rules are important.

50:23.310 --> 50:24.910
That's your expert opinion?

50:26.680 --> 50:28.210
That's my opinion.

50:28.250 --> 50:30.150
OK. Don't get uptight.

50:30.190 --> 50:33.280
-Not me.
-Bullshit.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.990
Look, every time we're on this
subject, the same thing happens.

50:36.030 --> 50:38.000
As long as we're rapping it out
on your terms...

50:38.030 --> 50:40.790
everything's OK, but the minute
I have a question...

50:40.830 --> 50:42.800
or I want to know
something specific from you...

50:42.830 --> 50:45.700
you either shine me on
or go out for coffee.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.670
What the hell is going on?

50:49.710 --> 50:51.700
You're pressing pretty hard.

50:51.740 --> 50:53.640
You'd better be damn sure
you want to know.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.170
This is not
freshman philosophy time.

50:56.210 --> 50:57.480
I'm sure.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.350
You ever hear
the term "mechanic"...

51:07.390 --> 51:09.360
used outside
of its normal meaning?

51:10.460 --> 51:11.660
Where?

51:11.700 --> 51:14.930
My father used it.
It's a dealer.

51:14.970 --> 51:17.300
A guy who works game tables.

51:17.330 --> 51:19.100
Anything else?

51:19.140 --> 51:22.940
Sure. It's a shooter.

51:22.970 --> 51:24.770
A hit man.

51:26.240 --> 51:27.440
So?

51:29.510 --> 51:31.000
So there we are.

51:33.150 --> 51:36.480
And that's your action?

51:36.520 --> 51:37.820
Yeah, that figures.

51:40.220 --> 51:41.890
I'm telling you this...

51:41.930 --> 51:45.360
because there are times
when I could use a backup.

51:45.400 --> 51:49.230
Wouldn't have
to spread myself so thin.

51:49.270 --> 51:53.700
And you seem
to have the aptitude.

51:53.740 --> 51:55.470
You do this for money?

51:57.480 --> 52:01.710
Money is paid,
but that's not the motive.

52:01.750 --> 52:07.980
It has to do with standing
outside of it all on your own.

52:09.120 --> 52:12.520
I'm gonna teach you all I can.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.690
After that, you can choose
how you want it to go.

52:17.700 --> 52:20.430
-You in?
-Do I have an alternative?

52:21.570 --> 52:24.530
There are alternatives
to everything.

52:25.970 --> 52:28.440
You've got a partner,
Mr. Bishop.

52:28.470 --> 52:30.060
Associate.

52:36.150 --> 52:39.740
Point the gun as though it were
an extension of your arm...

52:39.780 --> 52:42.510
and keep both eyes open.

52:42.550 --> 52:44.680
All right, you ready? Pull.

52:46.460 --> 52:49.590
That's better. Much better.

52:50.630 --> 52:51.820
Pull.

52:54.100 --> 52:55.400
Winchester.

52:55.430 --> 52:58.030
300 Magnum, 180 grains.

52:59.270 --> 53:02.000
Muzzle velocity.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.230
Pull!

53:05.240 --> 53:06.940
3,070.

53:06.980 --> 53:08.840
Drop at 200 yards.

53:10.850 --> 53:13.110
Two minutes low. Pull!

53:14.920 --> 53:17.550
300 yards.

53:17.590 --> 53:18.780
Pull.

53:21.630 --> 53:23.320
5.3 inches.

53:23.360 --> 53:27.060
300 yards, 150 grains.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.460
4.8 inches.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.490
Pull.

53:34.640 --> 53:35.830
Doubles.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.600
Pull.

53:44.380 --> 53:46.870
There are killers,
and there are killers.

53:46.920 --> 53:48.110
To tell you the truth...

53:48.150 --> 53:50.210
they all have
a different book of rules.

53:50.250 --> 53:52.520
To get away with it
depends on the book of rules...

53:52.560 --> 53:55.420
you have in your pocket
at the time.

53:55.460 --> 53:58.790
Your own country,
somebody else's country...

53:58.830 --> 54:02.230
or your own personal
book of rules.

54:02.270 --> 54:04.760
All this--heroes.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.830
Half of them were killers.

54:07.870 --> 54:12.170
Napoléon was one, you know?
Pancho Villa, Genghis Khan.

54:12.210 --> 54:14.400
And then we have
our own domestic brand...

54:14.450 --> 54:19.940
Like Billy the Kid, Jesse James,
and John Dillinger.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.280
Yeah, they're about as famous...

54:21.320 --> 54:23.120
as our own
honest-to-goodness heroes.

54:23.150 --> 54:25.380
Don't tell me
that's gonna make us heroes.

54:26.490 --> 54:28.150
I wouldn't tell you
anything like that.

54:28.190 --> 54:30.560
All I'm saying is that people
who stand outside the law...

54:30.590 --> 54:33.060
oftentimes end up as heroes.

54:38.240 --> 54:42.400
What's with that ball of wax
I see you squeezing?

54:42.440 --> 54:44.910
Sometimes you have
to hold the mark.

54:44.940 --> 54:47.540
It develops the strength.

54:53.420 --> 54:55.480
"In the ages
between 45 and 64...

54:55.520 --> 54:56.850
"of the total deaths
by accident...

54:56.890 --> 55:00.650
"10,431 were from falls."

55:00.690 --> 55:04.530
You know, falls from
high places are very clean.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.360
What's that?

55:06.400 --> 55:08.660
That is your first involvement.

55:29.920 --> 55:32.680
Taking the Zoo Drive turnoff.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.690
Now they're going west.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.490
There's one camera.

57:17.490 --> 57:18.690
Another.

57:19.830 --> 57:22.230
Two cameras
covering the main gate.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.580
You couldn't
get within 100 yards...

57:39.620 --> 57:41.480
without tripping
that alarm system.

57:45.060 --> 57:47.990
The guards sleep in shifts.

57:48.030 --> 57:50.260
One of them awake all the time.

57:50.290 --> 57:51.660
What about number one?

57:51.700 --> 57:54.760
Midnight till 4:00
in the morning.

57:57.070 --> 57:59.760
We need more.

57:59.800 --> 58:05.070
We'll have to stay in closer
until we find something.

58:05.110 --> 58:09.370
I want you to rent two cars,
a Ford and a Volkswagen.

58:26.630 --> 58:28.720
This looks like
it might be something.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.700
Turn this on.

58:44.550 --> 58:46.740
Comes across the border
at 1 a.m.

58:46.780 --> 58:49.810
I can have it to you
at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

58:49.850 --> 58:51.050
How?

58:51.090 --> 58:54.750
In a Chicken Lickin' truck
right to your place.

58:54.790 --> 58:58.420
OK. You check the goods
when it comes, then wake me.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.360
I'll make the test.

59:00.400 --> 59:02.870
Better not be crap.

59:02.900 --> 59:05.130
You know where to find me.

59:06.940 --> 59:09.270
Well, they'll have
to turn off the alarm system...

59:09.310 --> 59:10.640
to make that delivery.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.230
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

59:13.280 --> 59:16.970
One of the tools of the trade,
my friend.

59:24.860 --> 59:26.550
Allied Plating. This is Frank.

59:26.590 --> 59:29.530
Listen, I've got a bumper
that needs re-chroming.

59:29.560 --> 59:34.050
If I brought it in tomorrow,
can I pick it up by Saturday?

59:34.100 --> 59:35.960
We don't work
on Saturday down here.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.560
Monday afternoon the soonest.

59:37.600 --> 59:40.230
Monday's all right.
I'll bring it in tonight.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.310
Since there's no guard
on the weekends...

59:53.350 --> 59:54.820
at the Allied Plating plant...

59:54.850 --> 59:57.290
we could put the bodies
in these nitric acid tanks.

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:05.690
Mr. Bishop?

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:07.530
We would like you
to go ahead with this one.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.970
We go.

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.380
I'm gonna check you for iron
before you go past here.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.820
-Come on, get out.
-What's the matter?

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.150
Come on. Get out of there.

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.520
What the hell is this?

01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.710
Chicken Lickin'.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:44.180
Chicken Lickin'
is lickin' chicken.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.630
Wise guy.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.570
Get the bodies in the truck!

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.490
Do you know my dog
got a birthday card today?

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.920
I didn't. Just my dog.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.620
Archibald, those kids
on the hill there--

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.590
how can you live here
with all that noise?

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:35.600
I called the police,
but there's nothing they can do.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.740
Daddy, it's getting worse here
every weekend.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:24.430
In forty-eight hours...

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:26.730
everything will be in solution.

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:35.280
It was...

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.610
What?

01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:38.440
Well, it could've been
so simple...

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.110
but that guy
came out of nowhere.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:43.140
Those things happen...

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:44.710
but remember it the next time.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.360
Could you spare a few minutes,
Mr. Bishop?

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.690
Yes. When?

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:56.200
Now. I'm at home.

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:57.430
All right.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.630
I have to do something
for a while.

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:05.000
I'll see you later.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.590
Mr. Bishop is here, sir.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:32.090
Show him through.

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.260
This way, sir.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:10:00.520
That was very untidy,
Mr. Bishop.

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:05.230
We'd like to know how
Harry McKenna's son figures.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.560
He'll be working with me
from now on.

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.860
You think this is wise?

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:17.500
You telling me
I need your permission?

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.270
Information is all I want,
Mr. Bishop.

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:25.440
We like to know things.

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.150
An organization survives
only because its members...

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.090
are willing to sacrifice
certain personal choices...

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.350
for the good of all.

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:39.160
A very democratic principle,
Mr. Bishop.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.400
We survive
because we have this rule.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.000
What you or I want
is unimportant.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.010
Only the rule.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.850
Someone trained by me
could be of value to you.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:08.310
Nobody lives forever.

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:20.430
You take
full responsibility then?

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.940
This one has to be done fast.
Very fast.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.240
I'll handle it
the way I always do.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.580
There may not be
time enough for that.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.120
The word is, he's getting ready
to talk to some people.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.690
The problem is considerable.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.660
I'm not some wild
Cleveland shooter.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.630
I don't cowboy.

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:53.530
If he talks, things
could get complicated...sloppy.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.970
That would disturb a lot of us.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:59.200
It's not really open
to discussion, Mr. Bishop.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.140
This business
of McKenna's son...

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.640
has upset
a few of our associates.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.340
I understand it...

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.250
but these people
see it only from the outside.

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:12.280
A quick, clean job
would go a long way...

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.190
in putting everything
back into proper balance.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.750
Yes, I understand.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.600
I knew you would.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.030
Your man's in Naples.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.040
We've given you
a name in Rome...

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.340
for any equipment
you might need.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.510
Good. You're still up.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.950
I called you about 9:00.

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.920
Yeah, well,
Louise picked me up and we...

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.590
It's good for the nerves.
She has this thing she does--

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:38.920
Spare me the details.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.590
Look, if I'd known
you wanted to work--

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:43.120
You are a free agent, my friend.
The only thing you have to do...

01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:46.000
is fulfill the requirements
of the Association.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.870
And that means
your occasional presence...

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.870
some intelligent responses,
some skill at your work...

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:51.130
and nothing more.

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:54.040
You've got that,
so what's buggin' you?

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:00.780
We got one, huh?

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.480
They want him to be cowboyed.

01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:06.750
Explain.

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.280
They want me to get him now...

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.620
any way I can.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.020
That doesn't sound very cool.

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.930
What are you gonna do
about that?

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:17.630
I'm too far along
to change my habits.

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:19.900
I'll do what I've always done...
in Italy.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.170
Italy? Am I gonna go?

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.140
Why not?

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.870
Steve McKenna.

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.740
Mountain View Drive.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.910
Age twenty-four.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:08.680
Height - five foot, eleven inches.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.810
Weight - 165.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.190
Right-handed.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.220
Hair - blond.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.530
Distinguishing marks -

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.400
small scar on right arm.

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:30.630
Interests - girls, freaks...

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:32.940
physical fitness...

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.000
fast cars...

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.510
and killing.

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.750
Just like the postcards.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:48.480
Let's go to work.

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:19.550
What time?

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.450
It's 11:47.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.900
Good?

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:38.240
Last time I had this
was ten years ago.

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:40.040
They make it right here,
you know...

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.370
But not enough to export.

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.810
Casa de fiori doesn't travel.

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:51.150
It's not bad.

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:53.180
Slowly.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.990
The time you take
is very important.

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:57.550
Savor it.

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.230
Even what we're doing now.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:05.760
See, you must
figure it carefully.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.030
Don't rush.

01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:10.500
Know every move, turn it
over and over in your mind...

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.630
until you're sure
there are no holes.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.300
But you have to be
dead sure...or dead.

01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:19.250
No second chances.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.810
I'll try and remember that.

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:22.820
Remember, don't try.

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:26.340
Dead sure...or dead.

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:13.860
The room's not going
to get any bigger.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.570
I think I'll take a walk.
Is that all right with you?

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.600
What now?

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.970
It looks like
they're going south.

01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:28.910
We could follow
on the Coast Road.

01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:53.230
Excuse me, sir. Would you take
a picture of my wife and me?

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.500
Thank you.

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:27.560
It seems he doesn't do the same
thing the same way twice.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:33.190
Except spend Friday
and Saturday night on that boat.

01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:39.570
A diesel leak explosion
might be nice.

01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:42.840
Yeah, but how do we
get close enough?

01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:45.380
You scuba?

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.880
Yeah. Sure.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.580
Good.

01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:54.490
I'll go down to Rome,
pick up some equipment...

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.720
and be back tomorrow night.

01:23:59.190 --> 01:24:02.460
Meanwhile, you study this chart,
especially this area right here.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.760
Memorize the beach area,
offshore formations...

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.830
the depth, that sort of thing.

01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:10.240
You got it.

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:32.120
You really expect
this kind of action?

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.220
You begin to lose odds
out in the open like this.

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.700
You straight on everything?

01:24:37.570 --> 01:24:39.330
Where does our man sleep?

01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.960
Forward bunk, starboard.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.400
His friend?

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.870
-Aft, starboard.
-Engine hatch?

01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:48.540
About four feet aft
of the bridge.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.520
Let's go.
It'll be light soon.

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:04.250
It's a setup.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.270
Duck!

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.610
Speed boats.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.310
-How can they know?
-Give me that.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.830
Those friends of yours?

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.800
Come on, man,
what the hell is going on?

01:28:09.850 --> 01:28:11.680
They were sent
by the people I work for.

01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:12.940
Explain.

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:16.250
When I brought you in,
I didn't check with 'em.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.340
I broke a rule.

01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:22.020
That was fast of you
back there. Thanks.

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.820
How long till she goes?

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.890
Just about...now.

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.480
Marcello, Cergei.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.680
They're very thorough.
You drive.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.930
Hey, man, this is getting
just a little bit hairy.

01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:47.330
Yeah. I'm gonna try something.

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:11.820
That ought to take care of 'em.

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:15.460
One of 'em had a walkie-talkie.
He was in contact with somebody.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.270
There they are.
It's a road block.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:20.530
Slow down.

01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:26.030
When you're about
200 feet from them...

01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:28.200
put it in first
like you're going to stop...

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.570
but keep it rolling.

01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:31.770
Wedge this
against the gas pedal.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.650
Jump when I say so.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.530
All right,
jam it on the gas pedal now.

01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:03.510
All right. Ready, jump!

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.960
I'm empty.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.660
Same here.
What do we do now?

01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.140
Our friend back there
has picked up a machine gun.

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.860
Hey, pick it up and let's go.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.090
You might not get back
for another ten years.

01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:45.830
This really is a beautiful city.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
What the hell. Let's go.

01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:06.150
Brucine.

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:12.650
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:20.200
Listen,
you'll really appreciate this.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.430
This stuff is absolutely clear
when it's in solution.

01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:26.500
I just coated the inside
of the glass with it...

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.300
and let it dry.

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:30.310
And when the wine hit it...

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:34.110
it went right back
into solution--no trace.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.750
Looks just like a heart attack.

01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:44.460
You said every man
has his jelly spot.

01:36:44.490 --> 01:36:48.690
Yours was you just
couldn't cut it alone.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.060
Was it because of your father?

01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:58.900
You killed him?
I thought he just died.

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.640
You see? There you are.

01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:09.210
They told you who to hit.

01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:13.020
It kept the whole idea from
being what we talked about.

01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:17.390
You needed a license.
Their license.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.400
I'm gonna pick my own mark.

01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:29.490
Hit when I want.
Just like you said.

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.370
Standing outside.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.080
See Naples and die.

01:39:23.650 --> 01:39:26.120
"Steve, if you read this,
it means I didn't make it back.

01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:27.880
"It also means
you've broken a filament...

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:31.020
"controlling a thirteen-second
delay trigger.

01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.320
"End of game.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.690
"Bang. You're dead."
