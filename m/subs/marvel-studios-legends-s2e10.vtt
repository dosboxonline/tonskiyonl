WEBVTT

00:01.876 --> 00:04.421
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:34.117 --> 00:35.118
Jarvis!

00:35.493 --> 00:37.203
JARVIS: (DISTORTED) Welcome home, sir.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.001
FURY: You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

00:43.585 --> 00:46.588
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.548
You just don't know it yet.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.050
Who the hell are you?

00:51.301 --> 00:53.636
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.016
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.896
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.857
COULSON: Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.693
Uh, I'm still here at the Blockbuster.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.653
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

01:16.284 --> 01:19.162
FURY: I was never one
to believe in aliens...

01:20.080 --> 01:21.539
but I can't unsee that.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.334
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity.
Stay back.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.169
KELLER: We can't trust anyone.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.088
Not even our own men.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.714
CAROL: Nicholas Joseph Fury.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.800
FURY: Everybody calls me Fury.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.720
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph. Not Nick.
Just Fury.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.847
Excellent work, Nicholas.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.269
Was it something I said?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.364
FURY: Been riding a desk
trying to figure out

01:54.447 --> 01:56.407
where our future enemies are coming from.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.910
Never occurred to me
they would be coming from above.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.663
Deploy ballistic warheads.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.166
FURY: Hey.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.794
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

02:07.877 --> 02:08.962
Pretty much.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.011
(ALL SCREAMING)

02:21.391 --> 02:22.392
Okay.

02:22.767 --> 02:23.768
Good kitty.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.313
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? (LAUGHS)

02:27.522 --> 02:29.440
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.943
-(SNARLS)
-Ow! Mother Flerken!

02:34.279 --> 02:35.280
COULSON: So, is it true?

02:35.613 --> 02:37.240
That the Kree burned your eye out...

02:37.699 --> 02:41.202
I will neither confirm nor deny
the facts of that story.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.328
Understood.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.955
(PURRING)

02:44.539 --> 02:48.376
FURY: We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.837
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.882
We need to find more heroes.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.842
At ease, soldier!

02:56.926 --> 02:59.220
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.809
Sir. I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.062
WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL: You're going to
leave the fate of the human race

03:08.146 --> 03:09.814
to a handful of freaks.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.776
FURY: These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

03:14.694 --> 03:16.404
but I believe with the right push

03:16.487 --> 03:17.614
(GROANS)

03:18.823 --> 03:20.575
they can be exactly what we need.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.535
Agent Coulson is down.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.038
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.543
The idea was to bring together a group
of remarkable people.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.754
See if they could become
something more.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.800
See if they could work together
when we needed them to.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.803
To fight the battles that we never could.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.265
Phil Coulson died still believing.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.060
In heroes.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.563
-Sir.
-Agent Hill.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.899
HILL: Those cards,

03:52.982 --> 03:56.069
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.073
They needed the push.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.659
ROGERS: You think Fury's hiding something?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.702
STARK: He's a spy. He's "the" spy.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.663
His secrets have secrets.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.581
FURY: You're wrong about me.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.708
I do share.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.460
I'm nice like that.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.673
This is Project Insight.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.133
Three next-generation helicarriers

04:19.384 --> 04:21.970
synced to a network
of targeting satellites.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.390
We'll neutralize a lot of threats
before they happen.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.725
The punishment
comes after the crime.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.310
We can't afford to wait that long.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.646
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.483
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.780
We're gonna give it a push.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.702
FURY: It's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.287
-(GUNSHOTS)
-(GROANS)

04:50.540 --> 04:53.376
Don't trust anyone.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.674
HILL: They're initiating launch.

04:59.757 --> 05:03.428
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.887
TECH: Sat link coming online now.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.931
By sacrificing 20 million.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.516
PIERCE: (ON RADIO) We are go to target.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.934
TECH: All targets assigned.

05:13.980 --> 05:14.981
Fire when ready.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.862
ROGERS: Why all the secrecy?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.406
HILL: Any attempt on his life
had to look successful.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.907
I wasn't sure who to trust.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.369
If you want to stay ahead
of me, Mr. Secretary,

05:29.954 --> 05:32.915
you need to keep both eyes open.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.669
S.H.I.E.L.D. COMPUTER:
Alpha level confirmed.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.504
Safeguards removed.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.007
ROGERS: S.H.I.E.L.D.'s compromised.
You said so yourself.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.842
We're not just
taking down the carriers.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.428
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.391
HYDRA,

05:51.392 --> 05:52.393
S.H.I.E.L.D.,

05:53.144 --> 05:54.270
it all goes.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.565
Been data mining HYDRA's files.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.193
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.736
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

06:01.986 --> 06:06.282
Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.829
I see a suit of armor around the world.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.249
Artificial intelligence.
You never even hesitated.

06:15.917 --> 06:16.918
ULTRON: I'm here to help.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.588
-Ultron.
-In the flesh.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.672
Ultron.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.926
FURY: The guy is multiplying
faster than a Catholic rabbit.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.970
Look at me and tell me
you're going to shut him down.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.806
You're not the director of me.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.557
I'm not the director of anybody.

06:31.641 --> 06:36.437
Here we all are with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.399
ROGERS: What are you gonna do?

06:39.649 --> 06:42.485
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.242
Nice, right?

06:49.325 --> 06:52.203
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.746
She's dusty, but she'll do.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.419
Incoming!

07:02.255 --> 07:03.256
Oh, God!

07:09.846 --> 07:11.222
ROMANOFF: Nothing lasts forever.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.475
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

07:15.059 --> 07:19.230
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

07:19.814 --> 07:20.815
THOR: No!

07:23.901 --> 07:24.944
Oh, no.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.572
Mother...

07:29.115 --> 07:32.493
MAN: After The Blip, when you came back,

07:35.329 --> 07:36.747
you were different.
