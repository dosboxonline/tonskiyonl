01:09.154 --> 01:11.614
<i>I left this place
a thousand times in my mind,</i>

01:13.324 --> 01:14.826
<i>but I never actually
went anywhere.</i>

01:17.495 --> 01:18.705
<i>What was the final straw?</i>

01:20.331 --> 01:21.666
<i>I had nothing.</i>

01:23.668 --> 01:25.170
<i>There's the
unsupportive family.</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:28.131
No, I don't give a crap
if that's what she wants.

01:28.214 --> 01:31.092
She's not gonna sit
in my goddamn house
and do nothing!

01:32.969 --> 01:34.179
<i>The dead-end job.</i>

01:34.596 --> 01:36.931
<i>Jungle Ru went up and down</i>

01:37.015 --> 01:39.225
<i>On a big adventure</i>

01:39.309 --> 01:42.145
<i>Then getting fired
from the dead-end job
for being hungover.</i>

01:42.562 --> 01:43.605
Yeah...

01:44.689 --> 01:46.441
This isn't working.
I get it.

01:46.524 --> 01:50.236
Megan, it's just,
you don't really connect
with people very well.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.946
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.448
No, no, no, it's fine.

01:54.491 --> 01:55.575
Really.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.460
<i>In the end, you don't
leave because you have
somewhere to go.</i>

02:07.253 --> 02:09.172
<i>You leave because
there's nothing
keeping you there.</i>

02:26.856 --> 02:28.900
<i>All I know is that
after my best friend died,</i>

02:30.151 --> 02:31.444
<i>there was nothing
left for me here.</i>

02:33.404 --> 02:35.240
<i>I checked out of
life completely.</i>

02:38.868 --> 02:41.996
<i>And I realized if
I didn't leave now,</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:43.790
<i>I wasn't gonna
be far behind him.</i>

03:00.849 --> 03:02.767
<i>Due to heightened
security measures,</i>

03:02.934 --> 03:04.853
<i>please keep bags
with you at all times.</i>

03:04.936 --> 03:07.939
<i>All unaccompanied luggage
will be confiscated.</i>

03:37.927 --> 03:39.178
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

03:39.262 --> 03:43.600
Uh, what is this
pamphlet for the Marines
that I found in your dresser?

03:43.683 --> 03:46.060
I think there's some pot left
in the sock drawer
if you keep digging.

03:46.144 --> 03:47.979
Yeah, don't be a wise ass,
this is my house.

03:48.438 --> 03:50.899
And just so you know,
running away isn't
gonna solve anything,

03:50.982 --> 03:52.817
<i>'cause that's all
you've ever done...</i>
Hang up that phone!

03:53.276 --> 03:54.402
Let's go!

03:54.485 --> 03:57.113
Let's go, move, move, move.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.575
Let's go, faster,
come on, move, move.

04:01.159 --> 04:02.911
Tuck in that shirt!
My shirt?

04:02.994 --> 04:04.579
Tuck your shirt in!

04:05.079 --> 04:06.331
Fix your hair!

04:06.831 --> 04:09.125
Get in line, move!
Let's go, move.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.544
You have taken
the first step in
becoming a member

04:11.628 --> 04:13.338
of the world's
finest fighting force,

04:13.421 --> 04:15.006
the United States
Marine Corps.

04:15.340 --> 04:18.259
Tens of thousands of Marines
have begun outstanding service

04:18.343 --> 04:20.261
for our country
starting right here.

04:20.845 --> 04:24.098
You will continue
that proud tradition.
Do you understand?

04:24.349 --> 04:25.475
Aye-aye, sir!

04:25.558 --> 04:26.601
Say it like you mean it.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.686
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

04:33.274 --> 04:35.401
Right now, right now.

04:37.362 --> 04:40.239
When I tell you to move,
you better move!

04:45.328 --> 04:46.663
Marine Corps!

04:47.664 --> 04:49.040
You're an embarrassment!

04:51.376 --> 04:53.378
I said three, step up.

04:58.883 --> 04:59.968
Get off my wall.

05:00.093 --> 05:01.177
I can make it!

05:01.260 --> 05:03.429
Get off my rope and
get to the back of the line.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.019
Get those arms
straight, Leavey!

05:10.353 --> 05:11.729
Get those arms straight!

05:11.896 --> 05:13.147
I want straight arms!

05:13.231 --> 05:15.441
You're gonna die out there,
you hear me?

05:16.025 --> 05:18.861
- Have fun at the graduation.
- You're a failure.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.446
Get out of my face.

05:47.807 --> 05:50.059
Ready, front.

05:51.269 --> 05:52.979
Platoon 5004,

05:53.396 --> 05:54.522
dismissed!

05:55.773 --> 05:57.150
Aye-aye, ma'am!

06:15.752 --> 06:16.919
Megan?

06:17.628 --> 06:18.796
Hello!

06:19.464 --> 06:21.549
Hi.
Hi. We made it.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.135
Well, you didn't. You
actually missed it, but...

06:24.218 --> 06:26.304
Ah! You look like
a little toy soldier.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.014
Great, thanks.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.185
You missed it,
the whole ceremony,
but that's okay.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.854
Really?
Yeah, it's over.

06:34.937 --> 06:38.066
Jim... He really
wanted to see you graduate.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.902
Geez, you'd think
with all the taxes
we give to the military,

06:40.985 --> 06:43.738
they'd come up
with some kind of
street sign situation.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.281
Hey, sport.
Hey.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.325
Honey, we missed it.

06:48.659 --> 06:49.827
We missed it?
Mmm-hmm.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.829
Can you do it
again for us?

06:52.497 --> 06:55.249
<i>The United States will not
and cannot run that risk</i>

06:55.333 --> 06:56.501
<i>to the American people.</i>

06:57.335 --> 07:00.588
<i>Leaving Saddam Hussein
in possession of weapons
of mass destruction</i>

07:00.671 --> 07:02.924
<i>for a few more months
and years is not an option...</i>

07:03.424 --> 07:04.842
Well, you don't look terrible.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.553
Thanks.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.807
No, I mean,
I thought they were gonna
make you all <i>G.I. Jane,</i>

07:10.890 --> 07:12.141
you know. No hair...

07:12.225 --> 07:13.976
Hey, could we get the check,
please?
Yeah.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.520
You got it.
I just don't know

07:15.603 --> 07:16.604
why you wanna do this.

07:17.105 --> 07:18.356
Yeah, I know you don't.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.234
So, no one else came today?

07:21.943 --> 07:25.988
No, Dad couldn't get
off work, so lay off.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.615
I'm not talking bad about him,

07:27.698 --> 07:29.992
although he does owe me
two grand in alimony.

07:30.076 --> 07:31.661
You slept with his
best friend.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.329
Megan...
So I think you're even.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.497
Megan...

07:37.416 --> 07:38.543
Look, if...

07:39.836 --> 07:43.464
If something bad was
to happen, God forbid,
are we on the list?

07:44.549 --> 07:46.134
I mean, just so that
we would get notified?

07:46.217 --> 07:47.718
Yeah, you're on the list.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.763
Okay, so then,
like, with your father?

07:54.058 --> 07:56.435
You wanna know
how much you make
if I kick?

07:56.519 --> 07:57.979
Megan, don't be a shit,
no, that's...

07:58.062 --> 07:59.647
I just,
I don't know how this works.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.065
Thank you so much
for coming, Mom.

08:01.399 --> 08:02.483
Honey, I'm asking
you because I don't...

08:02.567 --> 08:03.651
Thank you for coming.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.819
No, thanks for coming.
I didn't expect...

08:04.902 --> 08:06.028
Bye, I love you.
Okay, bye, thank you.

08:06.112 --> 08:07.113
Love you!

08:07.196 --> 08:08.739
It's not like we drove
400 hours to get here.

08:08.823 --> 08:11.701
<i>Give Iraq one last chance.</i>

08:16.289 --> 08:19.667
<i>Jones,
is tobacco use permitted
in a government vehicle?</i>

08:19.750 --> 08:20.710
No, Master Sergeant.

08:20.793 --> 08:23.212
Is your patrol car
a government vehicle?

08:23.296 --> 08:24.797
Yes, Master Sergeant.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.508
Do we tolerate screw-ups,
losers, or laggards?

08:27.592 --> 08:28.676
No, Master Sergeant.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.679
Do we know
the meaning of the words
won't, can't, or late?

08:32.263 --> 08:33.431
No, Master Sergeant.

08:33.931 --> 08:37.643
We have three new joins
assigned to the
patrol section.

08:37.727 --> 08:40.563
Privates Timmins, Lopez,
and Leavey, welcome aboard.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.441
I trust you're gonna
make us all proud.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.362
Whoo!
It was so embarrassing.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.323
Are we not doing it
with salt or anything?

08:50.406 --> 08:51.699
No, no.
Seriously?

08:51.782 --> 08:53.284
This is, like,
hard core, okay.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.286
Yeah!

08:55.912 --> 08:57.205
I love this song.

08:58.456 --> 08:59.457
No!

09:04.128 --> 09:06.047
I need another drink.
What do you say you and I...

09:06.130 --> 09:07.465
Back off.
Hey, hey, hey.

09:08.216 --> 09:09.467
You're my hero.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.637
Huh? What?

09:14.430 --> 09:16.807
No, I prefer
the term "bleeder."
How much further...

09:16.891 --> 09:17.892
I love that.
My feet are killing me.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.143
That is so disgusting.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.396
Who even wears stilettos
to duty station?

09:22.480 --> 09:23.814
Screw you,
I'm like Wonder Woman.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.191
Oh, yeah.

09:26.359 --> 09:27.485
What!
Oh!

09:27.818 --> 09:29.737
I should have been
a baseball player.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.030
Oh, my God.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.240
We're gonna get in trouble.
Hold on.

09:32.323 --> 09:33.950
What are you doing?
Oh, God.

09:34.033 --> 09:36.452
Oh, wow, that's hot.
I like that sock look.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.165
You didn't have
anything for lunch.

09:41.707 --> 09:42.792
What is that?

09:43.167 --> 09:44.502
You're gonna
make me pee myself,

09:44.585 --> 09:45.878
seriously,
I'm gonna piss myself.

09:45.962 --> 09:47.880
Stop analyzing my puke.
I'm gonna piss myself.

09:47.964 --> 09:49.173
I'm gonna go pee.
Hold onto that.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.760
- Megan, we gotta hurry!
- I'll be quick.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.270
Hey!
Actually, let's...

10:02.353 --> 10:03.521
What's going on?

10:03.854 --> 10:05.356
Just turn around and walk.

10:05.815 --> 10:07.149
We're good,
we're good, it's all good.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.693
Oh, they got her.
It's all good.

10:13.531 --> 10:16.117
Um, I'm almost done.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.001
What's your problem, Leavey?

10:25.710 --> 10:26.752
Master Sergeant,
I'm sorry...

10:26.836 --> 10:29.714
Shut up.
Don't mess with me,
it brings out my Irish.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.342
Why are you here
in the Marines?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.387
You don't know, do you?
Well, I do.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.558
You think you're
the first entitled brat

10:40.641 --> 10:42.393
with a chip on her shoulder
who's come through my ranks?

10:42.893 --> 10:45.980
This institution is for
heroes, not little punks

10:46.063 --> 10:47.398
all screwed up in the head

10:47.481 --> 10:50.192
because their
mommies and daddies
didn't love them enough.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.028
But you're in my corps now,

10:52.111 --> 10:55.156
and I will not see you
disrespect the men and women

10:55.239 --> 10:56.657
who made the Marines great!

10:56.741 --> 10:58.826
Do you understand?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.161
Yes, Master Sergeant.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.959
One more hiccup
and I'll see you
kicked out of here,

11:07.043 --> 11:08.919
do you copy me?
Yes, Master Sergeant.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.422
All right,
you're on EMI,
shit detail,

11:11.505 --> 11:13.174
until further notice,
so get some rest.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.426
You're gonna need it.
Go on, get out of here.

11:40.785 --> 11:43.829
Gunny Martin,
meet PFC Leavey.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.956
She's yours for the day.

11:48.584 --> 11:49.585
Leavey...

11:50.461 --> 11:51.504
Welcome.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.855
Gross.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.908
Ahh!

12:23.494 --> 12:24.495
Ew!

12:26.831 --> 12:27.832
Ugh!

12:30.042 --> 12:31.419
Ugh!

12:35.631 --> 12:38.592
Yeah, Cindy, I bet you think
that's really funny, huh?

12:38.676 --> 12:39.885
Disgusting.

12:46.725 --> 12:47.852
Who's this?

12:48.269 --> 12:49.270
Rex?

12:50.604 --> 12:52.231
Hey, you handsome boy.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.192
Shit.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.612
Okay!

13:01.907 --> 13:02.908
You done in here?

13:03.117 --> 13:05.035
Uh, almost,
I've got two left.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.412
Good, we need you outside.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.504
Sit, sit.

13:16.046 --> 13:19.592
You found it,
you found it, good boy.
Come here, come here.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.761
Come here.
Sit down, come here.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.638
This guy loves
having his belly rubbed.

13:24.722 --> 13:26.056
What's he sniffing out?

13:27.224 --> 13:28.184
Explosives.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.562
We go in before the convoy,
sniff out IEDs,
make sure no one gets hurt.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.856
You guys on the front lines?

13:34.732 --> 13:36.150
Sometimes we're in
front of the front lines.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.570
Zeus here is a beast,
aren't ya?

13:40.571 --> 13:41.655
Is he yours?

13:41.739 --> 13:44.241
No, he belongs to the Corps,
but he's mine for now.

13:45.576 --> 13:46.827
What are you
here for, training?

13:46.911 --> 13:48.871
No, I'm cleaning out
the kennels for a week.

13:50.498 --> 13:51.957
How do you get to do that?

13:52.041 --> 13:53.459
Leavey, you up.

13:54.919 --> 13:55.920
I'm up?

14:07.598 --> 14:08.891
Attack!

14:09.642 --> 14:10.768
Get him!

14:11.685 --> 14:12.686
Ow!

14:13.437 --> 14:14.605
Out!

14:16.607 --> 14:17.775
You grab her?
Yeah, I got her.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.193
Hey, Cindy.

14:19.652 --> 14:21.987
Okay, Lance Corporal Walters,
you be the handler.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.656
You're still the decoy!

14:24.448 --> 14:25.533
Let's give Cindy a break.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.162
Oh, no, I'm good.
Sucks, huh?

14:30.496 --> 14:31.580
Yeah.

14:32.248 --> 14:34.667
You know,
I usually take the pants off,
just keep the top on.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.043
Really?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.336
Dogs know to aim
for the jacket.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.797
Thanks.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.100
Rex, heel. Heel, Rex.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.143
Oh... Shit.

14:54.270 --> 14:56.605
Okay,
this one, you approach.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.026
You listen to his spiel
and then start to run, okay?

15:02.695 --> 15:04.029
If Rex attacks,
you call him off.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.781
Sir, I would like
to see some ID.

15:08.158 --> 15:11.036
Sir, I'm gonna search you,
and if you try to run away

15:11.120 --> 15:12.663
or make any sudden
aggressive moves,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.415
my dog is trained
to attack you.

15:18.002 --> 15:19.837
Get him, get him. Get him.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.215
Ah! Get him off!

15:23.507 --> 15:25.843
Get him off!
Out, Rex, out.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.177
Out, Rex, out!

15:33.559 --> 15:34.560
Up.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.353
Up.

15:37.396 --> 15:38.397
Up.

15:39.023 --> 15:40.024
Up.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.527
Good boy, good boy.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.459
Oh, gee.

16:00.461 --> 16:01.545
You think
I'm afraid of you?

16:05.382 --> 16:06.383
Okay.

16:07.843 --> 16:08.969
I am afraid of you.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.806
But don't think
I can't make you
afraid of me, too.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.684
- That's right, I'm a badass...
- Leavey...

16:17.227 --> 16:18.395
You back for more, huh?

16:19.438 --> 16:20.939
Gunny, how do I become
a dog handler?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.108
You?
Yeah.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.235
What do I have to do exactly?

16:25.944 --> 16:28.197
For starters,
you need to stop
screwing up.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.991
Then, you'll need
an expert rifle score,

16:31.283 --> 16:34.662
above 90% on all your exams,
a first class PFT,

16:34.745 --> 16:36.205
and you know who
gets those things?

16:36.789 --> 16:38.332
People who
aren't full of shit.

16:38.666 --> 16:41.210
Gunny, I've been dealing
with a lot of shit
the past few days,

16:41.293 --> 16:42.878
and I can assure you,
I am not full of it.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.508
Well, that would surprise me,
because unless I heard wrong,

16:47.591 --> 16:50.344
you were just found
pissing outside the
Provost Marshal's office.

16:50.427 --> 16:51.387
The Provost Marshal?

16:51.470 --> 16:54.181
And that's definitely the act
of a full-of-shit person,
don't you think?

16:54.264 --> 16:55.349
Yes, Gunny.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.978
Crap.

17:01.772 --> 17:04.858
<i>Gene Monahan, the Yankees'
veteran trainer, is out.</i>

17:04.942 --> 17:08.946
<i>Looks like one of the doctors
in attendance is out.</i>

17:22.418 --> 17:26.130
Cease fire, cease fire,
unload, all clear.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.132
<i>There's lives in your hands.</i>

17:28.465 --> 17:29.842
Yes, sir.
And you are the alpha.

17:30.134 --> 17:33.178
It comes from you,
bring it from here,
so he knows you mean it.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.473
<i>So, you want us
to run it again?</i>

17:36.849 --> 17:38.851
<i>So we gonna keep running this
till we get it right.</i>

17:39.643 --> 17:40.936
<i>You're gonna save
lives out there.</i>

17:42.187 --> 17:44.690
<i>And the Red Sox come
pouring out of their dugout,</i>

17:44.773 --> 17:46.066
<i>the Yankees out of theirs.</i>

17:46.150 --> 17:49.194
<i>They've all met out
near the pitcher's mound
in a scrum.</i>

17:50.112 --> 17:51.321
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

17:58.370 --> 18:00.581
Why does your run
always seem to end up here?

18:02.291 --> 18:03.500
Does it?
I hadn't noticed.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.254
Hey, I've got a PFT
in a couple of weeks.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.380
Just wondering,

18:08.797 --> 18:10.090
you got any openings
coming up?

18:18.474 --> 18:19.767
Good talk.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.935
<i>Out of the gate, there's
a fly ball deep to left,</i>

18:22.019 --> 18:24.104
<i>it's on its way,
there it goes,</i>

18:24.188 --> 18:26.732
<i>and the Yankees are going
to the World Series!</i>

18:35.824 --> 18:39.369
Cease fire, cease fire,
unload, all clear.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.247
Shooters, your prep time
has ended

18:42.331 --> 18:44.333
with a magazine
of five rounds.

18:45.501 --> 18:46.877
I finished
the morning reports.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.754
I need
the trainer's schedule, too.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.380
When do you need it by?
1400.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.799
On it, Gunny.
Enter.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.428
PFC Leavey,

18:56.512 --> 18:58.722
why am I not surprised
to see you in here today?

19:01.099 --> 19:04.228
Yeah, I heard you got
first class on your PFT,

19:04.895 --> 19:06.063
and you shot expert.

19:06.814 --> 19:08.732
Gunny,
do you have a dog for me?
No.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.527
Did I excuse you?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.698
But I do got a can, though.

19:18.367 --> 19:19.576
What you say there, Mason?

19:20.244 --> 19:21.495
Think she ready for a can?

19:22.788 --> 19:24.122
I think so, Gunny.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.543
Carry on.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.712
Let's get to work.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.388
Hey, cute dog.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.431
What's his name?

19:42.140 --> 19:43.475
I mean, her name.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.271
I haven't named her yet,
I'm waiting for us to bond.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.606
Don't forgot to use
your praise voice.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.567
Good can, good can.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.443
At least my can
listens to me.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.114
Hey, she listens to me.
You listen to me, right, baby?

19:57.573 --> 19:59.032
Come on, come on.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.492
You hear that?

20:00.784 --> 20:01.785
Huh?

20:01.869 --> 20:03.412
Come on.
You hear that?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.082
Morning.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.292
Morning, Gunny.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.128
Any DUIs last night?

20:11.712 --> 20:12.880
No, Gunny.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.340
Good.
It's gonna be a good day.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.135
We gonna train
harder than ever before.

20:19.845 --> 20:21.471
Walters, what was
you doing last night?

20:21.972 --> 20:23.181
Playing <i>Halo,</i> Gunny.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.516
That's what you do
all the time?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.059
You shipping out
in three weeks.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.937
You better be ready to fight
when it's time to fight.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.940
Mason.
Yes, Gunny.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.150
Are you still a virgin?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.360
No, Gunny.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.446
Are you sure about that?
Because you look like one.

20:40.991 --> 20:42.618
Bennett, did you talk
to your wife last night?

20:42.701 --> 20:44.161
No, Gunny.
You think I give a damn?

20:46.705 --> 20:49.166
Coletta, you wipe
that smile off your face.
Yes, Gunny.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.959
Now, on a serious note,

20:51.043 --> 20:53.378
I have somebody that
just came back from Iraq.

20:54.004 --> 20:56.089
He wants to talk to y'all
about the experience,

20:57.174 --> 20:58.342
so you'll know what it is.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.385
He's been where you're going,

21:00.469 --> 21:03.597
and the things
that he tells you
will save lives

21:03.680 --> 21:04.848
and save limbs.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.684
This is Sergeant Andrew Dean.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.437
Sergeant, take the floor.
Thank you, Gunny.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.525
- Morning.
- Morning, Sergeant.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.569
Are you ready for war?

21:17.653 --> 21:18.946
Yes, Sergeant.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.864
Everything
you've prepared for,

21:21.907 --> 21:23.033
every lesson
you've learnt,

21:24.826 --> 21:26.370
everything you think
you know

21:27.537 --> 21:30.040
will just go to shit
the moment you're in country.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.167
These homemade bombs
are full of crap

21:32.250 --> 21:34.002
that our dogs
have never sniffed.

21:36.672 --> 21:40.717
You get caught in a sandstorm,
the dogs will be confused,

21:41.551 --> 21:43.428
and they won't be able
to detect the odor cones.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.392
You're about to be running
through shit's creek,
literally.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.562
With 50 pounds on your back,

21:53.563 --> 21:54.815
a dog on a leash,

21:55.565 --> 21:57.818
trying not to smack
his head in with your rifle.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.697
And the grunts that
you're protecting?

22:04.408 --> 22:06.076
Well, they'll pretty much
hate you from day one.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.205
Do this job right,
you might save lives.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.709
Do it wrong,
and you'll wind up dead.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.172
And no matter how bad
I'm making it sound,

22:20.090 --> 22:21.591
I'm not even coming close.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.559
You need to
keep them calm.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.855
Lie down, Rex, lie down.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.440
That's looking good.

22:37.566 --> 22:38.900
Down.
That's looking good.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.988
Just pull so there are
no wrinkles in the gauze.

22:43.488 --> 22:46.074
You need to practice
all of this before you deploy.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.578
Okay, let's take off
the leashes.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.041
Rex, no, no.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.043
Are you having
a problem over there?

22:56.126 --> 22:57.377
No, I got this.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.713
Good boy.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.175
I said take off the leash.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.428
Come on, buddy,
just relax.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.139
Good boy, just relax.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.224
You need to muzzle
that dog now.

23:12.809 --> 23:13.810
Ahh!

23:15.604 --> 23:16.730
Bad dog!

23:18.148 --> 23:19.149
Shit.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.234
It's gonna happen
when it happens.

23:21.318 --> 23:23.236
Gunny, I'm telling you,
it's gonna heal in no time.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.238
He broke six bones,
Walters.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.615
You wanted to see me,
Gunny?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.408
You're getting a dog.

23:28.492 --> 23:29.576
What?

23:29.659 --> 23:30.702
You're giving her my dog.

23:30.786 --> 23:32.079
Wait.
He's not your dog.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.081
He's not my dog.
He's a Marine Corps dog.

23:34.164 --> 23:35.707
Rex needs
an experienced handler.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.501
Are you questioning
my authority, Lance Corporal?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.544
She's a Boot. She's
only trained a can so far.

23:39.628 --> 23:42.005
Quit whining and act
like a goddamn Marine.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.970
You got this?
Think faster.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.138
Yeah, I got this.

23:50.514 --> 23:52.015
Good, you're dismissed.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.667
Remember me?

24:23.004 --> 24:25.507
All right, Rex,
get in the house.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.555
In the house, now.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.890
You're not gonna get any food
unless you listen to me.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.647
I will stand here
all day, okay?

24:56.329 --> 24:57.455
Yes.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.791
Good, good.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.043
Good boy, stay.

25:02.752 --> 25:03.920
Stay.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.935
Over here, seek.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.272
Seek, seek.

25:24.274 --> 25:25.483
Seek.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.903
That's time, Leavey.

25:28.945 --> 25:30.238
Damn it.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.455
You found one
out of five.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.040
See this guy?

25:40.123 --> 25:43.543
Dead, dead, dead.

25:43.627 --> 25:45.587
Oh, and your dog,
yeah, he's dead, too.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.965
And you blew off your
legs in the process.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.300
Follow me.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.387
Again, Leavey.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.557
Hey, hey. Hey.

25:57.641 --> 25:58.642
Where are you going?

25:58.975 --> 26:00.852
Following the perimeter.
He's pulling towards the desk.

26:00.936 --> 26:02.312
But I thought there
was a search pattern.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.189
Forget the search pattern,
Leavey.

26:05.106 --> 26:06.650
He's showing a change,
all right?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.193
Listen to him.
Okay.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.111
Rex, seek.
Follow him.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.321
Okay, seek.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.830
That's it, that's it.
He's on odor, present higher.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.927
Praise him, Leavey,
praise him.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.846
Good boy, good boy, good.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.684
Okay, this is a
good detection dog.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.519
There's nothing
wrong with him,

26:43.019 --> 26:44.354
so it must be you.

26:45.397 --> 26:46.815
What are you
doing wrong?

26:47.732 --> 26:50.819
Everything you feel
goes down leash, okay?

26:50.902 --> 26:51.987
Everything.

26:52.904 --> 26:54.698
If you're not confident,
then he's not confident.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.576
I could train the heck
out of you, Leavey, but...

27:00.036 --> 27:03.206
I can't teach you
how to bond, okay?

27:03.957 --> 27:04.958
Okay.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.876
Good work.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.096
Okay, he's just nervous.

27:18.847 --> 27:19.973
These aren't nerves.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.057
Shh!

27:21.141 --> 27:22.726
I've been watching
this dog all year.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.145
He's the most aggressive dog
I've ever treated.

27:27.397 --> 27:29.566
He can't deploy
without this exam.
Hey!

27:30.108 --> 27:31.776
I'll have to sedate him.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.033
Rex, calm down, calm down.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.868
Come on.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.664
This door always
stays closed, okay?

27:45.415 --> 27:47.542
Hey, Alice, Tucker.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.086
All right,
go find Walters

27:50.170 --> 27:51.629
and tell him I want Tucker's
cleaned out again.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.756
Yes, Sergeant.

27:53.048 --> 27:55.050
Hey, good girl.

27:56.801 --> 28:00.221
Leavey, wrap his leg.
Show him you're not afraid.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.765
Yes, Sergeant.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.979
Rex, sit. I mean...

28:09.105 --> 28:10.148
Lay down.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.734
Rex, lay down.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.952
Stay.

28:28.291 --> 28:29.793
I'm just gonna wrap your paw.

28:37.717 --> 28:38.718
Just...

28:39.344 --> 28:40.470
Here you go.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.681
Good, good.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.103
If you ever get
into trouble,

28:48.186 --> 28:49.687
you're gonna want me
to know how to do this.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.110
Hey.

28:57.362 --> 28:58.571
I didn't...

28:59.447 --> 29:00.782
I didn't ask for Rex.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.450
I didn't even want him.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.662
Yeah, well,
I did want him.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.540
So, don't get him killed.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.199
Hey.

29:44.576 --> 29:45.577
Hey.

30:03.261 --> 30:04.721
Rex, sit.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.391
Oh, good.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.948
We're shipping out tomorrow.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.744
We are so not ready for this.

30:30.747 --> 30:34.459
But people are counting on us,

30:34.542 --> 30:39.088
and if we do it wrong,
people die,
so we gotta do it right.

30:41.799 --> 30:42.967
Okay?

30:56.231 --> 30:59.692
<i>Tomorrow, beginning the
moment you step off that bird,</i>

30:59.776 --> 31:02.529
<i>you must act,
trust your training,</i>

31:02.987 --> 31:05.615
<i>trust your partner,
trust yourself.</i>

31:05.740 --> 31:06.741
Hoo-ah!

31:07.283 --> 31:08.493
<i>And remember,</i>

31:08.576 --> 31:11.871
<i>everything you see,
hear, taste, and touch</i>

31:11.955 --> 31:13.540
<i>over these next seven months</i>

31:14.165 --> 31:16.376
<i>will remain with you for
the rest of your lives.</i>

31:16.960 --> 31:18.127
<i>Make it count.</i>

31:22.173 --> 31:23.424
You okay, Leavey?

31:24.634 --> 31:26.219
Yeah, I just can't find
my Ka-Bar.

31:26.636 --> 31:28.513
It was in my
stuff and now I...
It's behind you.

31:31.432 --> 31:32.642
Thank you.

31:32.976 --> 31:35.311
Look, it's okay to be
freaking out right now,
all right?

31:35.395 --> 31:36.563
It's normal.

31:36.646 --> 31:38.398
I did, everybody does.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.483
You'll be fine.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.901
You got this.

31:41.985 --> 31:43.820
And I wanna hear about
all the asses you kicked

31:43.903 --> 31:45.029
when you come back.

31:45.113 --> 31:47.115
Not if, but when, okay?

31:47.198 --> 31:48.241
Okay.

31:52.620 --> 31:53.830
Good luck.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.331
Thank you.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.807
Rex, shh, quiet,
you're fine.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.394
Hour of silence, Leavey.
I'll settle for 30 minutes.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.604
I'm sorry.

32:32.535 --> 32:33.995
It works for birds.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.293
Hey, I know.

32:40.376 --> 32:42.587
Hey, it's okay, I know.

32:43.713 --> 32:44.797
You don't know
where we're going

32:44.881 --> 32:46.549
or what's gonna happen
when we get there.

32:47.884 --> 32:50.303
I know it sucks,
but we're in this
together, okay?

32:52.347 --> 32:54.891
It's okay.
It's okay, buddy,
I got you.

33:09.072 --> 33:11.407
We're on final,
be on the ground in 10.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.410
Get your gear together,
strap in.
Get ready for landing.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.829
All right.

33:18.289 --> 33:21.125
Okay, listen up.
Where's Marion and Peters?

33:21.209 --> 33:22.168
Sir.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.628
Your vehicles are
right over there.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.254
You're going to
Camp Perditha.

33:25.338 --> 33:26.673
Leavey, Jones.
Yeah.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.591
Your convoy's waiting for you
right over there.

33:28.675 --> 33:30.468
You're going to Camp Ramadi.
The rest of you, follow me.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.637
Hey, don't forget,
no matter how bad it gets,

33:33.471 --> 33:35.598
you could have been out there
sniffing bombs with a tin can.

33:36.766 --> 33:38.059
True.

33:38.476 --> 33:39.519
Be safe.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.270
Okay.
All right?

33:41.938 --> 33:43.106
Hey, good hunting.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.566
See you later, idiots.

33:45.775 --> 33:47.860
<i>Adios!</i>

34:15.763 --> 34:17.223
At least we got
a single, right?

34:20.393 --> 34:22.687
Sometimes it actually
pays to be a girl.

34:37.785 --> 34:39.162
Don't be scared.

34:52.008 --> 34:53.009
Hey.

34:55.678 --> 34:56.888
Oh, great.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.349
You wait to get to Iraq
to find your inner puppy.

35:38.888 --> 35:41.098
Up, up, up, up.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.267
Good boy, good boy.

35:43.351 --> 35:45.686
Yes, that's a good boy,
good boy.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.398
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.319
Good boy, good boy,
yeah, yeah.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.240
That's a good boy.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.075
Relax, Boot.

35:59.367 --> 36:00.827
It's outgoing, not incoming.

36:02.370 --> 36:03.496
Ain't that right,
Chico, huh?

36:03.704 --> 36:04.747
Thanks.

36:05.498 --> 36:08.584
Yeah, yeah.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.727
Settle down.
Come on, man.

36:26.811 --> 36:27.979
Let's go.

36:28.062 --> 36:29.188
Yeah, move it along.

36:29.272 --> 36:30.648
Hurry it up, all right?

36:47.582 --> 36:48.958
First day of school, bud.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.045
Wish me luck.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.807
I'm pretty sure they sell
loofahs in the gift shop.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.518
Actually, no,
they bombed the gift shop.

37:08.144 --> 37:10.021
Well, that's too bad.
I like loofahs.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.691
I'm Matt Morales.
I'll be your
tour guide today.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.484
Megan Leavey.
Who's that?

37:16.277 --> 37:17.737
This is Chico.
Chico, sit.

37:19.822 --> 37:21.616
I trained Chico to
lick the enemy to death.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.075
Nice.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.162
So, where are you from?
New York.

37:26.662 --> 37:27.663
Ah, yeah? Me, too.

37:27.747 --> 37:29.874
You're not a Yankees fan,
though, right?

37:29.957 --> 37:30.917
Born and bred.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.084
Oh, come on.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.045
Dagger to my heart,
really?

37:34.670 --> 37:37.131
Well, I guess we'll
never speak again, Megan.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.676
Chico, we don't talk
to Yankees fans, right?

37:40.760 --> 37:41.886
Good boy.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.476
This is Corporal Morales.

37:48.851 --> 37:50.686
Morales,
Lance Corporal Leavey.

37:51.062 --> 37:52.438
Morales will drop you
at the ECP,

37:52.521 --> 37:54.690
then he's off to Sadr City,
so you'll be on your own

37:54.774 --> 37:56.108
till we can get
another team out there.

37:56.192 --> 37:58.444
Just try and keep your
dog from overheating.

37:58.694 --> 37:59.779
Okay.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.281
Last female handler
got her panties in a pretzel

38:02.365 --> 38:04.909
'cause we don't
allow girls on missions,
just checkpoints.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.494
That gonna be
a problem with you?

38:06.577 --> 38:08.037
Not at all.
Good.

38:09.497 --> 38:10.873
Dismissed.

38:18.673 --> 38:20.007
"Panties in a pretzel."

38:20.800 --> 38:22.677
Hmm.

38:24.011 --> 38:25.429
Thought we weren't
talking anymore.

38:26.597 --> 38:27.890
Well, I was talking
to myself right there,

38:27.974 --> 38:30.309
but, you know,
I'll give you
another chance,

38:30.393 --> 38:32.061
and if you mention
the Yankees again,
we're done.

38:34.522 --> 38:36.399
Staff Sergeant Jarvis
is a real charmer, though.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.026
Last week he told me
he always liked my people.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.988
My dad's Puerto Rican,
my mom's Scandinavian.

38:43.197 --> 38:44.407
Who do you think he was
talking about, huh?

38:45.199 --> 38:46.617
The Scandinavians,
obviously.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.119
Right, that's what
I thought.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.138
Welcome
to the capital of shit.

39:50.473 --> 39:51.724
What's with all the dogs?

39:51.807 --> 39:55.144
Strays, full of diseases.
Keep 'em away from your dog.

39:55.561 --> 39:56.771
Shoot 'em if you have to.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.522
Here's all you need to know.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.149
Don't search till
they're out of the car.

40:00.483 --> 40:01.817
Make sure they open
everything.

40:02.610 --> 40:04.445
Remember, Iraqis,
they don't like dogs.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.238
It's in their
religious teachings,

40:06.363 --> 40:07.698
and they damn sure
don't like ours.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.241
There's a bounty
on canine handlers

40:09.325 --> 40:11.577
and an even bigger bounty
on female canine handlers.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.163
Which means they'll
probably wanna kill you.

40:15.748 --> 40:17.041
Well, actually,
unless they wanna bone you.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.168
Or they might wanna bone you
and then kill you.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.296
And if one of them
pulls out a cell phone,
boom, you're dead.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.674
Aside from that,
it's pretty chill.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.886
Seriously, be smart,

40:29.595 --> 40:31.347
keep your head on a swivel,
heightened awareness.

40:32.014 --> 40:33.057
Okay.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.536
Go, go, go,
get to the line.

41:07.716 --> 41:08.801
You need to have fun.

41:08.884 --> 41:09.885
No complaints, bro.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.389
See ya.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.904
Hey,
keep everybody moving.

41:30.322 --> 41:31.824
Jones, move his truck.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.077
Rex, you want some water?

41:38.789 --> 41:40.749
Bandini, tell that guy
to cut his engine.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.543
Turn your engine off.

41:51.177 --> 41:53.262
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

42:06.984 --> 42:08.527
Ask him the reason
for traveling today.

42:10.404 --> 42:12.573
I'm heading to Baghdad
for business.

42:12.948 --> 42:14.325
You speak English.

42:14.408 --> 42:15.784
Yes, better for business.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.872
Hey! Cut your engine off.

42:20.456 --> 42:22.583
I told you to
turn that bike off.

42:22.791 --> 42:23.959
Lift your shirts.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.130
Come on, turn around, come on.

42:31.926 --> 42:33.302
Leavey, clear the car.

42:33.636 --> 42:35.095
Open the trunk please, sir.

42:43.145 --> 42:44.647
Jesus, Bandini.

42:45.147 --> 42:46.982
I told you to
turn that bike off.

42:48.150 --> 42:49.610
Get up, get up.

42:50.152 --> 42:51.779
Stand over here.
Lift your shirt.

42:51.862 --> 42:53.489
Damn straight,
better for business.

42:54.073 --> 42:55.115
Stay back.

42:57.284 --> 42:59.912
You want me to
shoot you next time?
Pick your bike up.

43:02.122 --> 43:03.499
Don't touch it, though.

43:08.170 --> 43:09.338
No.

43:10.839 --> 43:12.800
Come here.

43:29.733 --> 43:30.943
Clear.

43:31.193 --> 43:32.695
What is his name?

43:32.778 --> 43:34.196
Hey, kid,
we ask the questions here.

43:35.072 --> 43:37.533
Sir,
could you get in the vehicle
and proceed to the checkpoint?

43:46.542 --> 43:47.876
His name is Rex.

43:49.503 --> 43:50.504
Here,

43:50.879 --> 43:53.799
let me give you
my card, X-box.

43:54.300 --> 43:55.426
No, no, no.

43:56.802 --> 43:58.637
- Back in your vehicle now.
- Rex!

43:59.388 --> 44:00.556
Come on.

44:02.766 --> 44:03.976
What are you doing?

44:04.059 --> 44:05.561
You never tell
a <i>Haji</i> your dog's name.

44:05.853 --> 44:06.812
He's just a kid.

44:06.895 --> 44:08.272
Yeah, and I've seen
kids not much older

44:08.355 --> 44:10.232
call a dog over with
a detonator in hand.

44:10.566 --> 44:13.027
You wanna keep your dog alive?
Sort your crap out.

44:13.694 --> 44:14.778
Hey, let's go.

44:15.863 --> 44:17.072
Next.

44:18.907 --> 44:21.201
Keep these people moving.
Let's go, let's go!

44:34.048 --> 44:36.342
We'll get better at this,
I promise.

44:38.010 --> 44:39.178
Good boy.

44:41.263 --> 44:43.015
- Seek.
- You sure?

44:45.476 --> 44:46.685
All right.
Oh, what is it?

44:46.769 --> 44:47.770
You did it.

44:48.395 --> 44:50.647
Good boy, good boy,
come on, come on.

44:51.023 --> 44:52.524
Seek, come on.

44:56.028 --> 44:57.237
Could be a full suit.
Check it out.

44:57.738 --> 44:59.823
Good boy, good boy.
Did he find it?

44:59.907 --> 45:01.200
Those guys ever take a break?

45:01.283 --> 45:03.118
- No.
- Come here.

45:03.827 --> 45:05.037
I guess so.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.288
Good boy.

45:06.622 --> 45:08.749
You wanna play, boy?
You wanna play?
Go get it.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.919
Good boy, Rex.
Come here, Rex.

45:16.590 --> 45:19.676
Leavey,
Recon needs you on a mission,
five minutes.

45:26.100 --> 45:27.643
I thought I wasn't
allowed to go on missions.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.311
There's no one else.
Get your gear.

45:37.820 --> 45:38.904
Yo.

45:40.155 --> 45:42.825
They blew up five of our guys.
Let's get in there
and smoke them out.

45:43.659 --> 45:45.744
One of you check the road.
The house is over here.

45:47.246 --> 45:48.705
I'll take the road.
You get the houses.

45:49.164 --> 45:52.167
Okay, hey, sweep the dogs.
They might be
stuffed with IEDs.

46:14.857 --> 46:15.983
Clear.

46:24.992 --> 46:27.119
I just wish this
guy had a couple rugs.

46:27.911 --> 46:29.288
Ask him why so many rugs?

46:29.371 --> 46:30.706
They're prayer rugs.
Ask him.

46:35.544 --> 46:36.920
They're a religious family.

46:38.714 --> 46:40.090
They're not
enemies of the States.

46:42.718 --> 46:43.927
And they thank
Americans for helping

46:44.011 --> 46:45.179
in the fight
against insurgents.

46:45.262 --> 46:47.306
Oh, we thank you
for your bullshit.

46:47.389 --> 46:49.308
Hey, open this cabinet.

46:52.519 --> 46:53.937
Open it!

46:59.026 --> 47:00.652
Get back.

47:04.948 --> 47:06.158
What's he got?
He got something?

47:06.241 --> 47:07.868
We need some room,
step back.

47:08.577 --> 47:09.661
Move these rugs.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.376
His sons put 'em there.
We don't care.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.836
Move them!

47:17.920 --> 47:18.962
He's not a well man.

47:19.046 --> 47:20.255
Tell <i>habibi</i> we don't
care about his health

47:20.339 --> 47:22.090
and he needs to move them.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:24.092 --> 47:25.177
Move them now.

47:27.095 --> 47:28.263
Today!

47:47.449 --> 47:49.826
Okay, gonna need
someone to check that.
I got it.

48:02.214 --> 48:03.465
Oh, my God.

48:03.799 --> 48:05.217
Don't move! Don't move!

48:05.467 --> 48:06.802
Hey! Stop!

48:08.136 --> 48:09.137
Stop!

48:09.304 --> 48:10.722
Don't move! Don't move!

48:11.807 --> 48:14.309
Nice work, cleared out
quicker than we found it.

48:15.477 --> 48:16.645
All right. More bad luck.

48:18.647 --> 48:19.815
Look at this.

48:20.274 --> 48:21.650
This is you?

48:21.984 --> 48:23.110
Well, it's him.

48:23.652 --> 48:25.445
Well, don't get all
big-headed on me now.

48:27.155 --> 48:29.032
Shit, you just
saved a bunch of lives.

48:30.659 --> 48:32.828
Outstanding work.
Both of you.

48:34.204 --> 48:35.289
Thank you.

48:37.583 --> 48:39.167
Come on, Chico.

48:54.266 --> 48:56.351
Three, two, one.

48:57.102 --> 48:58.186
You cheated!

48:59.229 --> 49:00.230
I won!

49:01.356 --> 49:02.899
I won! I won!

49:12.701 --> 49:14.536
It's okay, they're fine,
they're fine.

49:36.183 --> 49:38.185
Yeah, we shook 'em up.
Chico.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.647
Oh, you're slick,
'cause I already know
what card that is.

49:42.230 --> 49:43.690
There we go,
pick up some more.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.734
Keep going,
you still don't have it.

49:45.817 --> 49:46.818
Oh, my God.
Keep going.

49:46.902 --> 49:48.320
Keep going.
Relax.

49:48.403 --> 49:49.696
He looks like he's
actually trying to decide

49:49.780 --> 49:51.823
which of my body parts
he wants to eat first.

49:51.907 --> 49:53.033
Yeah, he is.

49:53.241 --> 49:54.242
Oh!

49:54.743 --> 49:56.286
The moment has come.
Mmm-hmm.

50:00.499 --> 50:02.000
You set that up.

50:02.709 --> 50:04.044
Totally didn't.

50:04.419 --> 50:05.962
That was good.
Thank you.

50:09.424 --> 50:10.592
So, Mets fan,

50:11.843 --> 50:13.011
did you ever play?

50:13.095 --> 50:15.681
I did, high school,
third base.

50:17.099 --> 50:18.850
I thought I was
actually pretty good,

50:19.393 --> 50:20.769
but college scouts disagreed,

50:21.687 --> 50:23.063
so here I am.

50:23.855 --> 50:27.609
Screw 'em, I'm not really
a sit-in-the-classroom
kind of guy anyway.

50:28.193 --> 50:29.194
Me neither.

50:29.945 --> 50:32.114
So, what's your story?

50:32.489 --> 50:33.782
Why'd you join?

50:33.865 --> 50:36.201
I wanted to get
the fuck away
from my life.

50:40.914 --> 50:42.124
That was a downer.

50:44.793 --> 50:47.295
Does it have
anything to do with Jesse?

50:49.756 --> 50:51.049
I saw your tattoo.

50:52.634 --> 50:53.635
Um...

50:56.388 --> 50:57.431
Yeah.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.933
I mean,
he was my best friend.

51:00.642 --> 51:02.310
We used to spend
every weekend
at his house.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.730
I mean, not like that.
We were...

51:04.813 --> 51:05.897
He was like my brother.

51:05.981 --> 51:07.357
His family was amazing,

51:08.150 --> 51:09.317
unlike mine.

51:09.818 --> 51:11.153
I spent Christmases there,

51:12.654 --> 51:17.409
and one weekend we were
drinking and taking pills,

51:17.492 --> 51:20.162
doing stupid
high school stuff,

51:21.163 --> 51:24.624
and we took
the exact same amount.

51:24.708 --> 51:28.295
I mean, I probably took
even more than he did, but...

51:30.922 --> 51:33.300
Well, I woke up.
He didn't.

51:34.843 --> 51:40.098
His family keep
trying to reach out,
but I can't even...

51:44.060 --> 51:45.604
It should have been me,
and we all know it.

51:52.027 --> 51:53.195
I gotta get up early.

51:55.030 --> 51:56.281
I'm gonna go to sleep.

52:02.454 --> 52:04.122
- Good night.
- Night.

52:31.691 --> 52:35.695
Good boy, good boy.

52:49.751 --> 52:52.003
We need one dog
team for a road sweep
and surrounding area check.

52:52.087 --> 52:53.213
But you requested
two teams.

52:53.296 --> 52:54.464
Things change.

52:54.548 --> 52:55.799
We only have
the room for one team.

52:58.093 --> 53:00.303
Hey, it's going down leash.
I'll go.

53:00.387 --> 53:01.429
Leavey.

53:02.889 --> 53:04.182
I got this.

53:06.268 --> 53:07.352
Line up!

53:07.435 --> 53:08.478
You heard him, let's go.

53:08.854 --> 53:10.146
Move it.

53:22.450 --> 53:23.660
You're from New York?

53:23.743 --> 53:24.870
Yeah.

53:25.328 --> 53:26.746
Me, too.

53:27.956 --> 53:29.416
My first time in country.

53:33.003 --> 53:34.254
What about him?

53:35.630 --> 53:36.798
Germany.

53:37.173 --> 53:38.592
Germany.

53:38.675 --> 53:40.135
German shepherd,
I like that.

53:41.219 --> 53:42.387
You know what I heard?

53:42.971 --> 53:45.223
I heard the enemy likes
to steal the dogs, right?

53:45.307 --> 53:46.474
Strap bombs on them,

53:47.851 --> 53:49.269
send them back
to their owner.

53:50.061 --> 53:52.397
Well, since Rex can break
someone's arm with his teeth,

53:52.480 --> 53:53.607
I'm not too worried.

54:19.257 --> 54:20.675
Leavey, dog up.

54:23.970 --> 54:24.971
It's okay.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.908
They've been spending
a lot of time together.

54:45.492 --> 54:46.618
I'm glad I'm not them.

54:46.701 --> 54:47.786
Stop talking!

55:30.370 --> 55:33.081
Good boy, good boy.

55:53.768 --> 55:55.228
Found something!

55:56.896 --> 55:59.524
Hey, Leavey, does he really
need another break?

56:00.525 --> 56:02.652
With all due respect,
it's been two hours,

56:02.736 --> 56:04.946
and it's 120 degrees,
so yeah, he does.

56:06.114 --> 56:07.282
It's not like
he hasn't earned it.

56:18.877 --> 56:19.919
Vehicle approaching.

56:20.003 --> 56:21.004
Guns up.

56:28.887 --> 56:30.388
Rex.

56:33.183 --> 56:35.143
Gomez, warning shot,
one round.

56:37.479 --> 56:38.688
He's not slowing.

56:39.147 --> 56:40.815
Stand by to light him up.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.125
Gomez, O'Connor,
secure the <i>Haji.</i>

56:59.209 --> 57:00.794
Get on the ground,
get on the ground.

57:02.670 --> 57:04.172
Get on the ground.

57:06.007 --> 57:07.425
Get on the ground.

57:09.302 --> 57:12.305
Get on the ground now,
get on the ground.

57:12.388 --> 57:13.848
Lay flat on the ground now.

57:13.932 --> 57:15.016
Put your hands
behind your back.

57:15.100 --> 57:16.351
Hands behind your back.

57:18.853 --> 57:19.896
Rex!

57:22.315 --> 57:23.358
Clear!

57:23.525 --> 57:24.818
Leavey, check the vehicle.

57:25.610 --> 57:27.112
Hey, come on, let's go.

57:29.531 --> 57:30.990
Okay, okay.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.698
Rex, Rex!

58:12.782 --> 58:15.577
Rex, no, no, no.

58:26.462 --> 58:27.755
Rex.

58:36.389 --> 58:38.099
I'm not leaving
without my dog.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.351
Come on, come on.

58:58.912 --> 58:59.996
Hey!

59:00.163 --> 59:01.497
How did your dog miss that?

59:01.581 --> 59:02.874
You could have
got us all killed.

59:03.750 --> 59:06.044
I never seen
an IED buried this deep.

59:09.881 --> 59:11.007
You gotta see this.

59:11.382 --> 59:13.426
They must have triggered
the bomb from those houses.

59:13.509 --> 59:15.303
I don't know, maybe
they were targeting Rex.

59:15.386 --> 59:16.804
No, they were
targeting Leavey and Rex.

59:16.888 --> 59:18.014
Let's get those cowards.

59:18.097 --> 59:19.974
Radio Morales, get him and
his dog down here now.

59:20.058 --> 59:22.644
No, if we wait for Morales,
the spotters will
be gone by then.

59:22.727 --> 59:24.395
We can do it.
No way, forget it.

59:24.479 --> 59:26.648
Do you see how many
IEDs we found today?

59:26.731 --> 59:28.274
How are you gonna make it
through the field without us?

59:28.358 --> 59:29.525
God damn it, Leavey,
you're injured.

59:29.609 --> 59:32.946
Yeah, because those assholes
waited all day watching us.

59:33.029 --> 59:34.197
She's got
a concussion, Sergeant.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.949
She may be confused,
disoriented.

59:36.032 --> 59:37.075
They almost killed us.

59:37.158 --> 59:40.286
How are you gonna
make it through the field
and the house without us?

59:40.370 --> 59:41.955
What about your dog?
He's injured, too.

59:55.343 --> 59:56.386
He's fine.

59:57.845 --> 59:59.180
We can do this.

1:00:04.018 --> 1:00:05.019
Let's go!

1:00:05.103 --> 1:00:06.312
I'm gonna check
with Air Support.

1:00:06.396 --> 1:00:08.022
In the meantime, Gomez,
get your team together.

1:00:08.106 --> 1:00:09.774
Get in there, check it out,
do it fast.

1:00:09.857 --> 1:00:11.651
- We'll cover you from here.
- Yes, sir.

1:00:11.734 --> 1:00:14.070
Go, what are you
waiting for? Move, move!

1:00:18.866 --> 1:00:19.867
The first house,

1:00:20.994 --> 1:00:22.328
150 meters.

1:00:23.913 --> 1:00:25.707
It's a little too quiet,
but it's up to you.

1:00:28.876 --> 1:00:30.044
We don't have all day.

1:00:31.838 --> 1:00:33.214
We'll follow you, Leavey.

1:00:33.881 --> 1:00:34.882
Let's move out.

1:00:52.275 --> 1:00:53.651
He found another one?

1:00:55.069 --> 1:00:56.446
Yeah.

1:01:02.702 --> 1:01:03.995
It's a pressure plate.

1:01:11.002 --> 1:01:14.047
Good boy. Seek.

1:01:27.143 --> 1:01:28.770
Okay, Leavey,
we're ready for you.

1:01:35.234 --> 1:01:36.694
Clear!

1:01:55.797 --> 1:01:56.964
Clear!

1:01:57.507 --> 1:01:59.133
- Leavey, you're up.
- Seek.

1:02:01.302 --> 1:02:02.762
This is a school.

1:02:05.139 --> 1:02:06.391
That's messed up.

1:02:09.435 --> 1:02:10.686
Seek.

1:02:25.785 --> 1:02:26.953
Okay, Leavey.

1:02:35.545 --> 1:02:37.046
Whoa, shit...

1:02:39.090 --> 1:02:40.425
Looks like
they were just here.

1:02:41.342 --> 1:02:42.844
Jackpot.

1:02:44.137 --> 1:02:45.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:02:46.055 --> 1:02:47.598
Leavey, Leavey, Leavey!

1:02:47.682 --> 1:02:49.225
Hey. It's okay.

1:02:49.308 --> 1:02:50.810
It's Gomez.
What do you want me to do?

1:02:50.893 --> 1:02:52.395
I don't know,
something's not right.

1:02:53.020 --> 1:02:55.273
He just got blown up, man.
I don't know what's going on.

1:02:55.356 --> 1:02:57.191
Leavey, I gotta move,
I gotta move.

1:03:01.279 --> 1:03:02.655
Get down!

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:14.876
Johnson, Johnson!

1:03:15.418 --> 1:03:17.086
Move it!
Let's move!

1:03:19.046 --> 1:03:20.381
We gotta move!

1:03:22.758 --> 1:03:24.051
Wait!

1:03:24.594 --> 1:03:25.678
Covering, move!

1:03:25.803 --> 1:03:26.804
Come on. Let's go.

1:03:26.888 --> 1:03:27.930
Johnson!

1:03:28.055 --> 1:03:29.140
Go, go, go, go!

1:03:29.724 --> 1:03:31.100
Let's go, let's go.

1:03:42.695 --> 1:03:46.324
Suppress the fire,
let's talk, boys, talk.
I wanna hear talk!

1:03:47.033 --> 1:03:48.910
Point and shoot,
point and shoot.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:50.953
Move it, move it.

1:03:51.037 --> 1:03:52.830
Leavey, Leavey!

1:03:52.914 --> 1:03:55.249
Johnson, Johnson, go!

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:56.667
We gotta move!

1:03:56.751 --> 1:03:58.002
Go, go, go.

1:03:58.628 --> 1:03:59.629
Move!

1:04:01.005 --> 1:04:02.965
O'Connor, O'Connor.

1:04:03.508 --> 1:04:05.801
Covering. Move!

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.053
Move, move!

1:04:16.979 --> 1:04:18.606
Move, Johnson!

1:04:23.236 --> 1:04:24.570
Covering, move!

1:04:26.989 --> 1:04:28.616
Go, Leavey, Leavey, move!

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:45.216
Moving, moving!

1:04:50.137 --> 1:04:52.223
We gotta go,
let's go, let's go!

1:04:53.015 --> 1:04:55.476
Suppressing fire, right flank.
Let's move, boys.

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:57.061
Light 'em up.

1:04:57.144 --> 1:04:58.563
Let's go, let's go!

1:04:58.646 --> 1:04:59.855
Let's go, move it, move it.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:01.649
Come on, come on, let's go.

1:05:03.693 --> 1:05:05.027
Covering!

1:05:05.111 --> 1:05:06.862
Shriner, where's Leavey,
Gomez?

1:05:08.155 --> 1:05:09.657
Johnson, move!

1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:11.325
Covering, move!

1:05:14.287 --> 1:05:15.621
Leavey, ready?

1:05:17.456 --> 1:05:19.250
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1:05:25.339 --> 1:05:27.049
Let's go, let's go.
Okay.

1:05:27.133 --> 1:05:28.134
Hurry up.

1:05:33.889 --> 1:05:35.850
Winchester
running low on ammo.

1:05:35.933 --> 1:05:37.602
- Go, go, go.
- Wait.

1:05:37.685 --> 1:05:39.437
Let's go, let's go, get in.

1:05:39.979 --> 1:05:41.439
Move it, move it, Leavey.

1:05:41.522 --> 1:05:43.399
Gomez, come on, get in.

1:05:43.482 --> 1:05:44.775
Leavey!

1:05:44.859 --> 1:05:46.068
Stop.

1:05:50.448 --> 1:05:51.699
I think
she didn't make it.

1:05:52.283 --> 1:05:53.951
She didn't make it!
Hold it right now.

1:05:55.161 --> 1:05:57.246
It's okay, it's okay.

1:05:57.330 --> 1:06:00.416
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1:06:00.499 --> 1:06:01.959
On the right flank,
right there.

1:06:02.043 --> 1:06:03.044
She didn't make it.

1:06:03.127 --> 1:06:04.170
Hold it.
Leavey!

1:06:04.253 --> 1:06:06.589
Let's go, let's go.
Move it, move it.

1:06:06.672 --> 1:06:08.090
- We're leaving.
- Wait!

1:06:08.174 --> 1:06:09.592
Slow down,
slow down, she's not in.

1:06:11.802 --> 1:06:13.554
Okay, let's go, let's go.

1:06:14.889 --> 1:06:16.682
- Yeah, we got her.
- Move, move!

1:06:39.997 --> 1:06:41.916
Leavey,
you're Medevac ASAP.

1:06:49.215 --> 1:06:51.801
Hey, I'll take care
of him, okay?

1:06:52.843 --> 1:06:54.261
I promise.

1:06:55.388 --> 1:06:56.597
Listen to me.

1:06:58.766 --> 1:07:00.393
It should have been me,
all right?

1:08:11.005 --> 1:08:14.216
<i>This is helo zero niner
departing Ramadi
with one wounded</i>

1:08:14.300 --> 1:08:16.677
<i>en route to
Baghdad hospital, over.</i>

1:08:19.847 --> 1:08:21.098
Okay, Corporal.

1:08:21.182 --> 1:08:24.059
Uh, you've got ruptured
eardrums, so hearing loss

1:08:24.143 --> 1:08:26.187
and even short-term memory
loss are gonna be normal,

1:08:26.896 --> 1:08:28.189
but you should fully recover.

1:08:28.272 --> 1:08:29.732
Where's my dog?
He's okay.

1:08:29.815 --> 1:08:31.192
He's fine,
he's at Blue Diamond.

1:08:31.275 --> 1:08:32.985
I need to see him.
Oh, no, no.

1:08:33.068 --> 1:08:34.653
Uh-uh, Corporal, no, no.
Lay down.

1:08:34.737 --> 1:08:35.905
He's okay, he's fine.

1:08:35.988 --> 1:08:38.574
The important thing
is we look after you,
make sure you're okay.

1:08:39.325 --> 1:08:40.659
And just so you know,
they're sending you home

1:08:40.743 --> 1:08:42.369
for Christmas, Corporal,
three weeks,

1:08:42.828 --> 1:08:44.914
then back to Pendleton
for training and rehab,

1:08:44.997 --> 1:08:46.874
and you'll see your dog
when you get back
to base, okay?

1:08:48.292 --> 1:08:50.961
Uh, we notified her commander,
so he's aware of
what's going on.

1:09:11.774 --> 1:09:13.025
Dad.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.004
I'm glad you're home.
You okay?

1:09:34.797 --> 1:09:35.798
Mmm-hmm.

1:09:41.554 --> 1:09:42.721
You look good.

1:09:42.805 --> 1:09:44.473
Okay.

1:09:54.650 --> 1:09:55.901
Um...

1:09:56.944 --> 1:09:59.154
I gotta work on Christmas.

1:10:00.406 --> 1:10:01.615
It's okay, Dad.

1:10:02.908 --> 1:10:04.076
You sure?
Yeah.

1:10:04.159 --> 1:10:05.327
You're okay?
Yeah.

1:10:05.411 --> 1:10:06.996
She'd probably
rather if I didn't...

1:10:07.580 --> 1:10:08.956
Yeah. I know.

1:10:09.039 --> 1:10:10.374
Go near there, so...

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.626
Merry Christmas.

1:10:12.710 --> 1:10:13.919
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

1:10:14.003 --> 1:10:15.796
I love you.
I love you.

1:10:16.171 --> 1:10:17.590
Thank God you're okay.

1:10:20.676 --> 1:10:21.886
Bye, you.

1:10:24.847 --> 1:10:25.973
You're sure
you're okay with that?

1:10:26.056 --> 1:10:27.474
Yeah, I got it.
All right.

1:10:29.727 --> 1:10:31.020
Thank you.
Yeah.

1:10:31.854 --> 1:10:33.022
Merry Christmas.

1:10:37.026 --> 1:10:38.110
Hi, baby.

1:10:38.235 --> 1:10:39.278
Hey, Mom.

1:10:41.906 --> 1:10:44.033
Okay, I am sorry,
but I'm just...

1:10:44.116 --> 1:10:45.367
What do you mean
Rex isn't back yet?

1:10:45.451 --> 1:10:47.745
He was supposed to
be back a week ago,
and every time I call,

1:10:47.828 --> 1:10:49.455
someone says that
he's gonna be back soon,

1:10:49.538 --> 1:10:50.581
he's gonna be back soon.

1:10:50.664 --> 1:10:52.374
I'm just
a little bit confused.

1:10:52.666 --> 1:10:54.376
I'm just telling you
what I know, Corporal...

1:10:54.752 --> 1:10:56.837
And please,
don't call again.

1:10:56.962 --> 1:10:59.340
I'll let you know
as soon as I have
something to report, okay?

1:10:59.423 --> 1:11:01.425
Okay, wait just one second.
If somebody could just...

1:11:09.099 --> 1:11:11.435
This is wonderful, honey.
Did you see this, Megan?

1:11:12.645 --> 1:11:13.938
Oh! This is wonderful.

1:11:15.356 --> 1:11:16.815
Here, honey, this is for you.

1:11:29.620 --> 1:11:30.829
Thank you, Mom.

1:11:32.373 --> 1:11:34.124
I would have liked
to get you more, honey,

1:11:34.208 --> 1:11:35.668
but the salon's
been slow so...

1:11:35.751 --> 1:11:37.086
That's okay.

1:11:38.671 --> 1:11:40.089
So, that's the one, honey.

1:11:40.172 --> 1:11:43.926
I'm, like, so happy,
you can't even imagine.

1:11:54.228 --> 1:11:55.771
Just double check
with Wilkins, all right?

1:11:55.854 --> 1:11:57.064
Yes, sir, will do.

1:12:00.067 --> 1:12:01.110
Reynolds?

1:12:01.652 --> 1:12:02.820
Hey, I'm Corporal Leavey.

1:12:02.903 --> 1:12:03.904
Leavey?
Yeah.

1:12:03.988 --> 1:12:04.989
Wow.

1:12:05.072 --> 1:12:07.866
You do know your phone style
is a bit aggressive, right?

1:12:07.950 --> 1:12:09.451
Actually,
I don't think she does.

1:12:10.577 --> 1:12:12.496
Hey.
Hey, what's up, Leavey?

1:12:12.579 --> 1:12:13.831
Hi.
How you doing?

1:12:13.914 --> 1:12:15.916
You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.501
I heard you got
a little rattled up
out there.

1:12:17.584 --> 1:12:19.128
Everything okay?
I'm fine.

1:12:19.211 --> 1:12:20.379
When did you get back?

1:12:20.462 --> 1:12:21.463
Uh, last week.

1:12:21.547 --> 1:12:23.173
I'm just here
for a couple days,
then I'm going back.

1:12:23.257 --> 1:12:24.425
How's Rex?
Where is he?

1:12:24.508 --> 1:12:26.343
I don't know.
I haven't seen him
in a while.

1:12:26.427 --> 1:12:27.428
Is he okay?

1:12:27.511 --> 1:12:29.346
I don't know how he is,
but I've been crap
without him.

1:12:29.430 --> 1:12:31.849
Yeah, yeah,
I can't imagine.

1:12:31.932 --> 1:12:35.019
I haven't left Bruno
for what, 12 hours?

1:12:35.102 --> 1:12:36.353
Who's a good boy, Bruno?

1:12:36.437 --> 1:12:38.313
Yes, sir, I'll tell her.

1:12:38.397 --> 1:12:40.274
Hey, you can go and cuddle,
too, if you like.

1:12:40.357 --> 1:12:41.608
Rex just pulled up
to the gate.

1:12:41.692 --> 1:12:43.569
Bruno, Bruno.
Bye, sir.

1:12:43.652 --> 1:12:44.778
All right.

1:12:46.780 --> 1:12:48.449
Hey, hi!

1:12:48.991 --> 1:12:51.160
Come here, come here,
good boy.

1:12:51.618 --> 1:12:53.871
Careful, careful.

1:12:54.371 --> 1:12:58.375
Good boy, good, hi, good.

1:13:00.085 --> 1:13:01.503
Oh! Good boy.

1:13:14.516 --> 1:13:15.934
Okay.

1:13:16.393 --> 1:13:21.065
Good boy, good boy, good boy,
good boy, good boy.

1:13:33.118 --> 1:13:34.495
Good.

1:13:34.870 --> 1:13:36.955
Good, good, come on.

1:13:38.165 --> 1:13:40.084
Come on, stop, this way.

1:13:40.626 --> 1:13:43.670
Rex, come, it's okay.

1:13:50.511 --> 1:13:53.180
Hey, what's going on?

1:13:53.263 --> 1:13:55.099
They told me
I didn't need
the bottoms.

1:13:57.101 --> 1:13:58.769
Yeah, well that depends on
how much you like keeping

1:13:58.852 --> 1:14:00.270
both halves of your ass.

1:14:00.354 --> 1:14:01.522
Keep them on.

1:14:03.482 --> 1:14:04.650
Ha-ha!

1:14:04.733 --> 1:14:05.943
You guys are very funny!

1:14:09.154 --> 1:14:10.948
Okay, slow down,
slow down, slow down,

1:14:11.031 --> 1:14:12.658
it's just some flowers,
it's okay.

1:14:21.375 --> 1:14:22.668
It's...

1:14:22.751 --> 1:14:25.254
The crazy part,
then they ended
up having loofahs,

1:14:25.337 --> 1:14:28.799
but they said they
couldn't deliver a loofah.

1:14:29.842 --> 1:14:31.468
It was sweet,
that's really sweet.

1:14:31.718 --> 1:14:33.303
I mean, I like flowers,
too.

1:14:33.387 --> 1:14:35.264
Cool, but the loofah
would have been, come on.

1:14:35.347 --> 1:14:36.348
That would have
been funnier, yeah.

1:14:36.390 --> 1:14:37.724
The loofah would
have worked, right?
Yeah, yeah.

1:14:37.808 --> 1:14:39.101
I know. Um...

1:14:39.643 --> 1:14:41.019
So, hi.

1:14:41.103 --> 1:14:42.229
Hi.
Hey.

1:14:50.904 --> 1:14:52.406
Wow, you're really strong.

1:14:57.911 --> 1:15:00.205
They're like college beds,
like dorm room beds.

1:15:00.289 --> 1:15:01.582
It's awful.
Yeah.

1:15:01.999 --> 1:15:04.126
Well, the good news is
you probably don't have

1:15:04.209 --> 1:15:05.169
to pay for drinks anymore

1:15:05.252 --> 1:15:06.753
now that you're a war hero
and everything.

1:15:07.462 --> 1:15:08.839
You think I'm a hero?

1:15:08.922 --> 1:15:11.508
Well, that's the word
on the street.

1:15:13.218 --> 1:15:14.845
So what have you been up to?
What's going on?

1:15:14.970 --> 1:15:18.265
Um, mostly just
physical therapy.
It's the worst.

1:15:19.391 --> 1:15:22.769
The nurse is
an absolute witch,
so that's not fun.

1:15:23.437 --> 1:15:24.771
Ai!
Yeah.

1:15:24.855 --> 1:15:26.440
So, what hurts?
Where does it hurt?

1:15:27.024 --> 1:15:28.025
Um...

1:15:28.192 --> 1:15:29.443
Mostly my head.

1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:32.863
My back, my neck,

1:15:32.946 --> 1:15:35.032
and I just...

1:15:35.115 --> 1:15:36.950
It feels like the bomb
blew out my arches.

1:15:37.951 --> 1:15:39.077
So everywhere.
Mmm-hmm.

1:15:39.995 --> 1:15:42.831
Well, no more
high heels for you.

1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:45.626
I know, so bummed about that.

1:15:46.793 --> 1:15:47.878
Hey, let me get your foot.

1:15:47.961 --> 1:15:49.046
Let me do some magic.

1:15:49.129 --> 1:15:50.839
A massage?
Yeah.

1:15:50.964 --> 1:15:53.300
Just 'cause
you're a hero.

1:15:53.383 --> 1:15:54.509
Lucky me.

1:15:54.593 --> 1:15:55.636
Heroes get massages.

1:15:55.719 --> 1:15:57.179
I should get exploded
more often.

1:15:57.262 --> 1:15:59.264
Yeah, I should
fly back more often.

1:16:00.224 --> 1:16:01.642
How's your boy,
Rex, doing?

1:16:03.227 --> 1:16:04.519
He's good.

1:16:05.646 --> 1:16:07.481
He's doing better,
it's just slow.

1:16:08.148 --> 1:16:09.983
I think that I'm gonna
be able to start training
with him again

1:16:10.067 --> 1:16:11.193
in a couple weeks.

1:16:11.652 --> 1:16:12.861
Hmm.

1:16:14.488 --> 1:16:15.781
How long do I have you for?

1:16:17.157 --> 1:16:18.617
Well, that depends.

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:19.910
How long do you want me for?

1:16:20.786 --> 1:16:23.163
I'm a young man, we live
into our 80s in my family.
Oh!

1:16:24.498 --> 1:16:25.916
Yeah, we get divorced
in mine.

1:16:25.999 --> 1:16:27.000
Mmm.

1:16:27.292 --> 1:16:28.919
I could possibly make
an exception, though,

1:16:29.002 --> 1:16:32.506
if you were all of a sudden,
say, a Yankees fan,

1:16:32.589 --> 1:16:34.091
went to a lot
of Yankees games.

1:16:34.174 --> 1:16:36.927
That's a lot, you see,
that's a lot to ask for.

1:16:37.010 --> 1:16:38.679
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

1:16:39.930 --> 1:16:41.473
I'm being serious.

1:16:44.434 --> 1:16:46.019
Well, so am I.

1:16:46.895 --> 1:16:49.439
I don't do the whole
forever and ever thing.

1:16:49.523 --> 1:16:51.858
Look, trust me,
neither do I, usually.

1:16:51.942 --> 1:16:54.111
Okay, well,
so stop being so serious.

1:16:54.194 --> 1:16:56.530
Let's just...
Let's just make out.

1:17:06.331 --> 1:17:08.208
Inspection, 20 minutes.

1:17:09.042 --> 1:17:10.711
This is...
Don't say anything.

1:17:10.836 --> 1:17:12.462
We could get in trouble,
though, right?
Yes.

1:17:13.213 --> 1:17:14.840
I think we should relocate...

1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:17.592
But not now.

1:17:21.013 --> 1:17:23.307
Detail, attention.

1:17:28.228 --> 1:17:31.648
<i>I'm sorry to inform
you that Andrew Dean,</i>

1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.235
<i>Sergeant Andrew Dean,</i>

1:17:36.737 --> 1:17:40.532
was killed by a suicide bomber
at 1537 yesterday.

1:17:41.742 --> 1:17:45.412
<i>He tried to stop him,
but he couldn't in time.</i>

1:17:48.623 --> 1:17:49.916
<i>Bruno survived.</i>

1:17:50.542 --> 1:17:52.294
<i>They found Bruno
lying on top of him.</i>

1:17:54.087 --> 1:17:55.714
<i>Andrew Dean was a good Marine,</i>

1:17:57.090 --> 1:17:58.759
<i>and he was a very good man.</i>

1:18:01.386 --> 1:18:02.721
<i>God bless his soul.</i>

1:18:02.846 --> 1:18:06.058
Bruno, up, Bruno, Bruno.

1:18:06.141 --> 1:18:09.478
Bruno, here boy, here, up.

1:18:09.770 --> 1:18:13.607
Bruno up, Bruno,
Bruno, here boy.

1:18:14.691 --> 1:18:16.610
Bruno, here, Bruno.

1:18:18.445 --> 1:18:19.780
He's looking for him.

1:18:20.364 --> 1:18:21.531
He'll never stop.

1:18:22.991 --> 1:18:24.409
Sometimes we don't realize,

1:18:26.286 --> 1:18:29.289
as much as they our family,
we theirs, too.

1:18:39.966 --> 1:18:42.761
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1:18:44.805 --> 1:18:46.014
Come on, baby.

1:18:47.057 --> 1:18:49.309
Okay, come on,
gonna try again.
Let's try again.

1:18:52.187 --> 1:18:54.481
Ready? Ready?

1:18:55.232 --> 1:18:56.441
Rex, come.

1:18:56.775 --> 1:18:58.193
Come on, come on.

1:19:01.363 --> 1:19:03.281
Come on, come on.

1:19:09.454 --> 1:19:10.539
I know.

1:19:11.623 --> 1:19:12.874
It's okay.

1:19:18.255 --> 1:19:19.714
Rex, Rex.

1:19:20.006 --> 1:19:21.425
Hey, it's okay.

1:19:21.508 --> 1:19:24.344
Rex, come,
it's okay, it's okay.

1:19:26.179 --> 1:19:27.681
It's okay.

1:19:28.181 --> 1:19:29.641
I'm gonna keep you safe.

1:19:33.019 --> 1:19:34.187
I don't know
what we're gonna do,

1:19:34.312 --> 1:19:35.480
but we're not
going back there.

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:55.876
So, I've been thinking,

1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:58.378
I don't think
I'm gonna re-enlist.

1:20:00.130 --> 1:20:01.256
How do you feel about that?

1:20:01.923 --> 1:20:03.300
You wanna come live with me?

1:20:07.053 --> 1:20:08.346
Did you just fart?

1:20:09.723 --> 1:20:10.849
That's disgusting.

1:20:13.268 --> 1:20:15.353
And now you're falling asleep
while I talk to you?

1:20:17.898 --> 1:20:19.441
I mean,
do you have any plans?

1:20:19.983 --> 1:20:20.984
Um...

1:20:21.568 --> 1:20:24.946
My plan is just to
figure it out
as I go along.

1:20:25.030 --> 1:20:26.114
The civilian life.

1:20:26.364 --> 1:20:28.074
You wanna live that pop life?

1:20:28.492 --> 1:20:30.160
Mmm-hmm?
What is that?

1:20:30.243 --> 1:20:32.996
You're gonna be
the fourth member
of Destiny's Child?

1:20:33.079 --> 1:20:34.289
Not exactly, no.

1:20:34.372 --> 1:20:35.499
That wasn't my plan.

1:20:35.582 --> 1:20:38.668
Now, I'm gonna
give you two weeks,

1:20:39.419 --> 1:20:41.087
and you're gonna be
bored out your mind.

1:20:41.713 --> 1:20:44.257
I bet you'll be
back in my office
begging for your job back.

1:20:44.341 --> 1:20:46.176
Yeah, but I was
blown up, so...

1:20:46.927 --> 1:20:48.803
Boring sounds
really great right now.

1:20:48.887 --> 1:20:52.057
I know it's been some
rough times recently,

1:20:52.140 --> 1:20:54.017
but I just don't want you
to rush into something

1:20:54.100 --> 1:20:56.520
that you're not
ready to get into,

1:20:56.603 --> 1:20:58.480
especially when this
is something you love.

1:20:58.563 --> 1:21:00.941
It is what I love,
but I...

1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:07.405
Pretty sure I found something,
someone that I love even more,
and, um...

1:21:08.448 --> 1:21:09.449
Well, actually,
I was wondering,

1:21:09.533 --> 1:21:11.535
I was hoping that you
would write me a letter

1:21:11.618 --> 1:21:13.828
supporting me to adopt him.

1:21:14.371 --> 1:21:16.414
Well, of course
I will, Corporal.

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:20.252
You think I'm crazy?

1:21:23.463 --> 1:21:25.715
Oh, is that
a trick question? Like...

1:21:25.799 --> 1:21:28.009
No,
I'm being serious.

1:21:29.302 --> 1:21:30.804
What, for leaving
the Marines?

1:21:31.429 --> 1:21:32.597
Yeah.

1:21:32.722 --> 1:21:33.890
No, absolutely not.

1:21:34.891 --> 1:21:36.226
You did your time.

1:21:39.312 --> 1:21:40.564
Hey,
when's your tour up?

1:21:41.439 --> 1:21:42.816
It was up...

1:21:43.858 --> 1:21:44.943
A week ago.

1:21:45.944 --> 1:21:48.530
Now, I'm theirs
for another 51.

1:21:53.577 --> 1:21:54.578
Uh...

1:21:55.287 --> 1:21:56.663
Okay, so...

1:22:00.083 --> 1:22:01.334
You re-upped?

1:22:03.336 --> 1:22:04.671
Yeah, I mean,

1:22:05.672 --> 1:22:07.507
what, is that a problem?

1:22:10.802 --> 1:22:11.970
Yeah.

1:22:12.846 --> 1:22:14.139
That's a problem.

1:22:14.222 --> 1:22:16.182
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, Megan.

1:22:16.808 --> 1:22:19.436
Megan, what
are you doing?

1:22:19.519 --> 1:22:21.062
Look, you didn't ask
me when you decided

1:22:21.146 --> 1:22:23.523
to leave the Marines,
and I wouldn't expect you to.

1:22:23.607 --> 1:22:25.775
Look, it's your decision.
I'm happy...

1:22:25.859 --> 1:22:27.694
Don't pretend
like you didn't know
this would piss me off.

1:22:29.154 --> 1:22:30.614
You act like we
talked about this.

1:22:30.697 --> 1:22:32.198
I mean, how the hell
could I know that?

1:22:32.324 --> 1:22:34.659
I don't know,
but it sucks that you didn't.

1:22:38.455 --> 1:22:40.165
He's tender, he's tender.

1:22:40.707 --> 1:22:41.875
It's okay.

1:22:41.958 --> 1:22:43.126
You want to adopt
this animal?

1:22:43.543 --> 1:22:44.961
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1:22:45.045 --> 1:22:47.714
He's scared and he's tender,
like I said.

1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:50.008
Please don't write that.

1:22:50.383 --> 1:22:51.468
Are you listening to me?

1:22:51.551 --> 1:22:54.304
He's just scared and
he hates this muzzle
that he's wearing,

1:22:54.387 --> 1:22:57.599
and no offense,
but he's not a massive fan
of being at the vet's either.

1:22:58.975 --> 1:23:00.352
I'll see him again
in a week.

1:23:00.435 --> 1:23:01.811
Okay, but please don't
leave that on his chart,

1:23:01.895 --> 1:23:03.313
'cause they'll
never let me adopt him.

1:23:03.396 --> 1:23:04.731
That's the point.

1:23:05.273 --> 1:23:07.776
Are you having some sort of
like a power trip
or something?

1:23:08.693 --> 1:23:10.570
Are you not supposed to be
helping these animals?

1:23:12.447 --> 1:23:14.407
You poked him
where he's hurt.

1:23:14.866 --> 1:23:16.117
He reacted.

1:23:16.576 --> 1:23:20.246
Let's set off 40
pounds of explosives
five feet under you

1:23:20.330 --> 1:23:22.666
and see how you like
being poked afterwards.

1:23:22.749 --> 1:23:25.126
Please, I'm begging you.
Please take it
out of his file!

1:23:40.058 --> 1:23:41.935
Where's Rex?
No idea.

1:23:46.022 --> 1:23:47.691
Hey, Forman.
Come on.

1:23:48.274 --> 1:23:49.526
What's the deal?

1:23:49.943 --> 1:23:51.277
I'm getting him ready.

1:23:51.403 --> 1:23:52.362
What do you mean?

1:23:52.445 --> 1:23:53.947
They want him in Afghanistan.

1:23:54.030 --> 1:23:55.198
What? What are you
talking about?

1:23:55.281 --> 1:23:56.408
They're redeploying him.

1:23:56.491 --> 1:23:58.660
No, no, they took
him off active duty.

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.620
Well, I guess they
changed their minds.

1:24:01.746 --> 1:24:03.206
Are you his handler?

1:24:05.375 --> 1:24:06.793
I'm sorry.

1:24:08.294 --> 1:24:09.879
Hey, jerks. Let's go.

1:24:09.963 --> 1:24:11.339
Gunny.

1:24:31.776 --> 1:24:33.820
Jesus, Leavey,
what are you doing here?

1:24:34.988 --> 1:24:36.156
Gunny, I...

1:24:37.240 --> 1:24:40.910
I came to say that I am sorry
for messing up your office.

1:24:40.994 --> 1:24:43.163
Now that's the weakest
apology I ever heard.

1:24:43.955 --> 1:24:45.623
Rex is not ready
to be redeployed.

1:24:45.707 --> 1:24:46.708
It's not my call.

1:24:47.083 --> 1:24:48.418
The vet disagrees with you.

1:24:48.501 --> 1:24:49.919
He's a different dog.

1:24:50.003 --> 1:24:51.004
He has changed.

1:24:51.087 --> 1:24:52.088
I can't help you.

1:24:52.172 --> 1:24:55.049
Please, please just
change his classification

1:24:55.133 --> 1:24:57.594
so that I can adopt him
when he gets back,

1:24:58.178 --> 1:24:59.220
if he gets back.

1:24:59.304 --> 1:25:00.805
Your concern for
the animal is honorable.

1:25:01.765 --> 1:25:03.933
You're devoted to him,
and I understand that,

1:25:04.017 --> 1:25:05.101
and I understand
why you're angry.

1:25:05.185 --> 1:25:07.812
I'm not angry, I am trying

1:25:08.855 --> 1:25:12.275
to give a war hero a home
for the last few years
of his life.

1:25:12.358 --> 1:25:14.444
How would you feel
if we had to put Rex down

1:25:14.903 --> 1:25:17.822
because he bit
the hand of a four-year-old
he passes on the street?

1:25:19.032 --> 1:25:21.367
Just because the boy
was holding a toy gun?

1:25:21.910 --> 1:25:22.911
Hmm?

1:25:23.953 --> 1:25:25.038
It happens.

1:25:25.872 --> 1:25:26.956
I've...

1:25:29.292 --> 1:25:31.294
I've looked into
the parents' eyes before.

1:25:34.130 --> 1:25:35.548
I know what that feels like.

1:25:36.883 --> 1:25:38.384
They aren't pets.

1:25:38.468 --> 1:25:39.886
They aren't even dogs anymore.

1:25:41.012 --> 1:25:42.263
They're warriors,

1:25:42.347 --> 1:25:44.766
and they come back with
all the same issues we do.

1:25:46.726 --> 1:25:50.396
We're not being cruel,
we're being intelligent
and responsible.

1:25:51.731 --> 1:25:54.275
No, no, not to Rex.
I'm sorry.

1:25:55.318 --> 1:25:56.402
I really am.

1:25:57.737 --> 1:25:58.822
Please.

1:25:59.239 --> 1:26:01.991
Leavey,
just let this one go.

1:26:02.075 --> 1:26:04.327
Please. Gunny.

1:26:05.078 --> 1:26:06.412
Please.

1:26:06.496 --> 1:26:07.747
Look, Leavey, I'm sorry.

1:26:24.097 --> 1:26:25.265
Look,

1:26:26.558 --> 1:26:28.393
he's being flown out
in a couple of days.

1:26:29.394 --> 1:26:31.896
If you wanna say
goodbye to him,
I can arrange that.

1:26:56.421 --> 1:26:57.422
Hey.

1:27:20.069 --> 1:27:21.279
I'm sorry.

1:28:39.065 --> 1:28:40.358
Megan.

1:28:41.901 --> 1:28:43.444
Megan, honey.

1:28:45.697 --> 1:28:46.990
Megan!

1:28:50.410 --> 1:28:51.577
What?

1:28:52.203 --> 1:28:53.705
Megan,
put some clothes on.

1:28:54.247 --> 1:28:55.832
What?
Who loves you?

1:28:56.749 --> 1:28:57.750
What's going on?

1:28:58.251 --> 1:28:59.752
Come over here and meet her.

1:28:59.836 --> 1:29:02.213
I didn't name her
because I wanted you to,
but if you don't call her

1:29:02.296 --> 1:29:03.548
Lover Girl,
I think you're crazy.

1:29:03.631 --> 1:29:05.008
You've gotta be kidding me.

1:29:05.091 --> 1:29:06.175
No, I'm not kidding you.

1:29:06.259 --> 1:29:07.719
You thought you
could just replace him?

1:29:08.803 --> 1:29:10.680
Honey, I'm not trying
to replace him, I just...

1:29:11.931 --> 1:29:14.684
Look, I know you
love him, but...
Jesus Christ,

1:29:14.767 --> 1:29:16.602
Megan, you're a mess.
You can't let your whole life

1:29:16.728 --> 1:29:18.104
fall apart over some dog.

1:29:18.604 --> 1:29:20.023
Some dog?

1:29:21.107 --> 1:29:22.817
That dog saved my life.

1:29:25.528 --> 1:29:27.113
Go to hell.
Hey, now, Megan,

1:29:27.196 --> 1:29:28.364
you can't talk to
your mother like that.

1:29:28.448 --> 1:29:29.782
She is trying to help you.

1:29:29.866 --> 1:29:31.284
Get a job, Jim.

1:29:31.367 --> 1:29:32.452
We are not finished here.

1:29:32.535 --> 1:29:35.538
You cannot come
back to my house
like some big war hero

1:29:35.621 --> 1:29:38.374
and talk to me like that
just because you got hurt.

1:29:38.458 --> 1:29:39.625
Back off, Mom!

1:29:39.709 --> 1:29:41.544
You can screw up your life
as much as you want.

1:29:41.627 --> 1:29:43.046
You cannot take it
out on me.

1:29:43.129 --> 1:29:44.839
Go in there right now
and apologize to my husband!

1:29:44.922 --> 1:29:45.882
Apologize?
Yes!

1:29:45.965 --> 1:29:47.216
Apologize to this guy?

1:29:47.300 --> 1:29:48.301
Yes.

1:29:48.384 --> 1:29:50.136
I can't believe you left Dad
for this douchebag.

1:29:50.261 --> 1:29:51.554
You have no
goddamn right to...

1:29:51.637 --> 1:29:53.723
You know what...
Go be with your father.

1:29:53.806 --> 1:29:55.641
I am done!
Gladly!

1:30:10.156 --> 1:30:11.282
Hey.

1:30:18.122 --> 1:30:19.165
Baby.

1:30:28.216 --> 1:30:29.634
Son of a bitch.

1:30:37.975 --> 1:30:39.060
Don't open it!

1:30:39.143 --> 1:30:40.269
Jesus, baby, baby.

1:30:41.187 --> 1:30:43.022
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a car.

1:30:45.358 --> 1:30:47.193
It's the alarm,
sweetie, it's okay.

1:30:51.823 --> 1:30:52.865
It's all right.

1:31:35.408 --> 1:31:36.868
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

1:31:37.201 --> 1:31:39.245
You have any idea
how hot it is in there?

1:31:39.912 --> 1:31:40.913
How hot it is?

1:31:40.997 --> 1:31:42.832
Take care of
your animal, asshole.

1:31:42.915 --> 1:31:45.376
My animal is fine.
What are you, crazy?

1:31:50.423 --> 1:31:52.258
Lunatic.

1:32:11.527 --> 1:32:14.530
Hi. Hi, yeah,
can I talk to Forman?

1:32:18.284 --> 1:32:19.827
It's about Rex.

1:32:21.162 --> 1:32:22.788
Yeah, I know I keep calling.

1:32:40.431 --> 1:32:42.516
Megan,
how are you doing?

1:32:44.310 --> 1:32:45.603
We haven't
heard much from you.

1:32:46.604 --> 1:32:48.606
I'm okay, I'm better.

1:32:49.065 --> 1:32:50.399
In what ways?

1:32:51.901 --> 1:32:53.069
Well, I...

1:32:54.111 --> 1:32:58.449
I don't flip out as much when
I see or hear certain things.

1:32:58.824 --> 1:33:00.159
I still can't quite...

1:33:01.744 --> 1:33:06.415
Tolerate any real,
um, human interaction.

1:33:07.833 --> 1:33:09.752
Even you guys
are kind of a drag.

1:33:11.295 --> 1:33:12.546
How are you sleeping?

1:33:13.506 --> 1:33:14.507
Um...

1:33:15.925 --> 1:33:17.426
Just a few bad dreams.

1:33:17.510 --> 1:33:18.678
About?

1:33:19.262 --> 1:33:21.806
Mmm. Mostly imagining
what he's doing.

1:33:24.058 --> 1:33:25.685
Just hoping he's not in pain.

1:33:27.687 --> 1:33:28.854
He could die any day.

1:33:28.938 --> 1:33:31.107
He could be dead
right now, and...

1:33:31.190 --> 1:33:34.360
What would you say to Rex
if he were here right now?

1:33:38.739 --> 1:33:40.366
Well, you know
he's a dog, right?

1:34:04.598 --> 1:34:06.475
This is gonna
sound so cheesy, but...

1:34:07.226 --> 1:34:08.227
Um...

1:34:13.232 --> 1:34:15.860
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1:34:22.742 --> 1:34:24.035
I'd probably, um...

1:34:25.453 --> 1:34:27.705
I'd thank him for...

1:34:30.416 --> 1:34:32.501
Trying to teach me
what love is.

1:34:34.712 --> 1:34:36.005
What do you mean, trying?

1:34:36.589 --> 1:34:38.591
It sounds like
he taught you a lot.

1:34:46.891 --> 1:34:48.392
Hey.
Hey.

1:34:49.226 --> 1:34:50.269
Is that dinner?

1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:57.943
Well, they always said
breakfast is the
most important meal.

1:35:00.946 --> 1:35:02.198
How was your day?

1:35:04.950 --> 1:35:05.993
You go to group?

1:35:06.952 --> 1:35:08.204
How was it?

1:35:12.041 --> 1:35:15.127
Uh, so, uh,
this came for you.

1:35:15.795 --> 1:35:17.630
Who is Morales?

1:35:18.381 --> 1:35:20.216
Why is he sending you
Mets crap?

1:35:21.884 --> 1:35:23.552
He's just some guy
I used to know.

1:35:23.636 --> 1:35:26.222
Yeah, some guy I'm gonna
have to be chasing off
with a shotgun?

1:35:26.764 --> 1:35:27.765
Mm-mm.

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:30.810
Baby,

1:35:31.894 --> 1:35:36.190
I know that you feel
like you lost everything.

1:35:39.735 --> 1:35:41.153
I know what that feels like.

1:35:43.155 --> 1:35:47.159
But the thing is,
you gotta keep living.

1:35:49.245 --> 1:35:51.163
I am living.
No, you're not.

1:35:53.999 --> 1:35:55.292
This isn't living.

1:35:57.086 --> 1:35:58.754
You gotta figure out
what it would take

1:36:00.297 --> 1:36:01.841
to make it worth it.

1:36:10.015 --> 1:36:11.183
Rex would be worth it.

1:36:18.023 --> 1:36:19.442
You know what
you gotta do?

1:36:20.985 --> 1:36:24.280
They won't talk to me.
I have abandoned him, I left.

1:36:24.363 --> 1:36:25.865
Then you gotta find a way.

1:36:27.199 --> 1:36:29.952
There are a few people
in life, not many,

1:36:30.953 --> 1:36:32.663
that you gotta
find a way for.

1:36:33.581 --> 1:36:34.915
If you needed something,

1:36:35.708 --> 1:36:38.127
I would do
whatever it took,

1:36:38.210 --> 1:36:40.087
not because I'm any
kind of great dad,

1:36:40.671 --> 1:36:44.383
but because how I love you
is stronger than what I'm not.

1:36:47.219 --> 1:36:49.889
I want you to be
a person who shows up

1:36:51.307 --> 1:36:53.017
for work,

1:36:55.019 --> 1:36:56.395
for your friends' funerals,

1:36:58.355 --> 1:36:59.523
for life.

1:37:02.067 --> 1:37:03.819
I've tried, I failed.

1:37:03.903 --> 1:37:04.987
So fail again.

1:37:05.946 --> 1:37:10.826
And just keep failing
until they're tossing dirt
on your corpse.

1:37:14.371 --> 1:37:15.664
Baby, all you gotta do
is fight,

1:37:16.457 --> 1:37:17.583
and you know how to fight.

1:37:19.418 --> 1:37:20.753
You're a frickin' Marine.

1:37:21.921 --> 1:37:23.005
Right?

1:37:26.258 --> 1:37:27.551
I love you.

1:37:31.055 --> 1:37:32.890
Can I toss this, please?

1:37:33.599 --> 1:37:36.018
Maybe burn it?

1:37:37.603 --> 1:37:38.604
Please.

1:37:38.729 --> 1:37:39.813
It's disgusting.

1:37:40.731 --> 1:37:42.233
Actually, maybe just
keep the card.

1:37:42.775 --> 1:37:43.776
You don't need it.

1:37:45.861 --> 1:37:48.155
I can't wait
another three weeks
for someone to call me back.

1:37:48.239 --> 1:37:49.907
Can I just talk to him
for five minutes?

1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:53.494
Well, it's actually not.
It's an Air Force decision.

1:37:53.577 --> 1:37:55.704
The Air Force
oversees the canine program.

1:37:55.913 --> 1:37:57.665
Well, then, can you tell me
exactly where he is?

1:38:01.418 --> 1:38:03.379
Okay, look, I know
I sound like a stalker here,

1:38:03.462 --> 1:38:05.089
but I'm calling
for a war hero.

1:38:11.470 --> 1:38:13.138
Hello?
Corporal Leavey.

1:38:15.182 --> 1:38:16.475
It's Sergeant Forman.

1:38:16.559 --> 1:38:17.935
<i>I've been getting
your messages all week,</i>

1:38:18.644 --> 1:38:19.853
<i>figured I better
call you back,</i>

1:38:19.937 --> 1:38:20.896
seeing as you're
the only reason

1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:22.982
I still have a complete
set of butt cheeks.

1:38:23.065 --> 1:38:25.359
Hey, yeah, I have been
calling all week.

1:38:25.442 --> 1:38:28.654
I guess I just
wanted to know,
how's Rex?

1:38:28.737 --> 1:38:29.989
He'd love to see you.

1:38:30.990 --> 1:38:32.366
Wait, what?
Rex.

1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:37.162
<i>You there?</i>
Yeah, uh...

1:38:37.246 --> 1:38:39.415
They finally decided
to retire him.

1:38:39.832 --> 1:38:42.876
I just thought you might
want to come
to the ceremony.

1:38:43.252 --> 1:38:44.712
Yes, I'm...

1:38:44.837 --> 1:38:46.589
<i>Does this mean that
I can adopt him now?</i>

1:38:46.672 --> 1:38:50.009
I don't think so.
I'm looking at his file
and it says he's unadoptable.

1:38:50.509 --> 1:38:53.095
I know what it says,
I know, but, uh...

1:38:53.178 --> 1:38:54.638
I mean, hasn't he
been reassessed?

1:38:55.014 --> 1:38:56.223
I have no idea,

1:38:57.099 --> 1:38:59.810
but it still says
unadoptable
on his paperwork,

1:39:00.936 --> 1:39:02.313
and, uh...

1:39:04.023 --> 1:39:05.274
He's pretty sick, Megan.

1:39:06.859 --> 1:39:08.152
How bad is it?

1:39:09.236 --> 1:39:11.113
If you're gonna
try and do something,
I'd do it fast.

1:39:36.972 --> 1:39:39.475
All right,
then after that, we open.

1:39:39.725 --> 1:39:40.726
Senator?

1:39:42.394 --> 1:39:43.562
Senator Schumer?

1:39:43.729 --> 1:39:46.440
Excuse me, can I just have
a moment of your time?

1:39:46.565 --> 1:39:47.691
I'm in the
middle of something.

1:39:47.775 --> 1:39:48.817
I've been calling
for weeks.

1:39:48.901 --> 1:39:50.653
It's about my partner
in Afghanistan.

1:39:50.736 --> 1:39:52.404
He's not doing well.
He needs your help.

1:39:52.780 --> 1:39:54.156
All right,
I'll get back to you later.

1:39:55.658 --> 1:39:57.618
Uh, his name is Rex.
He's a bomb sniffer.

1:39:57.701 --> 1:39:59.203
He saved thousands
of lives in Iraq.

1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:03.874
Here we are in Fallujah.
He found all those AK-47s.

1:40:04.708 --> 1:40:07.127
And here we are in Ramadi,

1:40:07.586 --> 1:40:09.588
and, uh, here
he is today.

1:40:09.672 --> 1:40:12.174
He's 10 years old,
and if I can't adopt him,

1:40:12.257 --> 1:40:13.550
then they're gonna
put him to sleep.

1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:16.345
What did you say
your name was?

1:40:16.428 --> 1:40:18.013
Uh, Megan, sorry.

1:40:20.265 --> 1:40:21.433
Corporal Megan Leavey.

1:40:22.351 --> 1:40:23.769
Oh, Very nice to
meet you, Corporal.

1:40:24.687 --> 1:40:25.854
My pleasure.

1:40:26.855 --> 1:40:30.567
Um, sir, sir, excuse...
Excuse me!

1:40:30.984 --> 1:40:32.444
Sir!

1:40:33.070 --> 1:40:35.989
Finn, don't yell at people.

1:40:36.281 --> 1:40:37.366
How else am I supposed
to get his attention?

1:40:37.449 --> 1:40:38.659
You're literally
scaring him away.

1:40:38.742 --> 1:40:39.952
Just be quiet.

1:40:40.619 --> 1:40:42.121
Have a conversation
with someone.

1:40:42.204 --> 1:40:43.997
Hi, sign my petition
to adopt a veteran war dog?

1:40:44.081 --> 1:40:45.624
So, what is this for?

1:40:46.083 --> 1:40:49.628
This is a petition for me
to adopt my Marine war dog.

1:40:50.212 --> 1:40:52.631
He's very sick
and his retirement
ceremony's coming up,

1:40:52.715 --> 1:40:54.341
so I'm really hoping
I get to bring him home.

1:40:56.719 --> 1:40:58.178
You're the Marine?
Mmm-hmm.

1:40:59.096 --> 1:41:00.139
Thank you.

1:41:00.222 --> 1:41:01.765
Thank you
for your service.

1:41:06.270 --> 1:41:07.312
It's not that hard.

1:41:12.443 --> 1:41:16.613
We're live in five,
four, three...

1:41:19.158 --> 1:41:21.243
Hi, I'm Kristine Johnson.

1:41:21.326 --> 1:41:23.829
Today, we're joined by
a very special guest.

1:41:24.580 --> 1:41:27.249
Thank you, Megan,
for being here,
and tell us your story.

1:41:27.332 --> 1:41:29.168
Why is Rex
so important to you?

1:41:30.002 --> 1:41:32.504
Well, he's just
an amazing animal,

1:41:32.588 --> 1:41:36.675
<i>and I want him to be able
to live the rest of his life</i>

1:41:36.759 --> 1:41:40.763
<i>in a happy home with someone
that he knows and loves.</i>

1:41:40.846 --> 1:41:41.972
<i>And why can't he?</i>

1:41:42.055 --> 1:41:45.392
<i>Um, because
a while ago, they thought
he was unsafe,</i>

1:41:45.476 --> 1:41:47.144
<i>but really,
he was just scared,</i>

1:41:47.519 --> 1:41:50.063
<i>and probably confused,</i>

1:41:50.147 --> 1:41:53.692
<i>probably just as
confused and scared
as I was at the time.</i>

1:41:54.026 --> 1:41:57.362
And you were hit by
an explosion together,
an IED, isn't that right?

1:41:57.821 --> 1:42:00.199
Yeah, in 2006,
we were injured in Iraq.

1:42:00.324 --> 1:42:02.284
But despite your injuries,

1:42:02.367 --> 1:42:04.453
the two of you
continued the mission.

1:42:04.536 --> 1:42:06.079
That's right.
That's amazing.

1:42:06.163 --> 1:42:07.456
Oh, thank you.

1:42:07.539 --> 1:42:10.375
<i>Now,
I read that you have 22...</i>

1:42:10.459 --> 1:42:11.585
<i>Twenty-two thousand.</i>

1:42:11.668 --> 1:42:12.961
<i>Twenty-two thousand names
on your petition.</i>

1:42:13.045 --> 1:42:14.129
Yes!

1:42:14.213 --> 1:42:15.964
That kind of support,
is it helping?

1:42:16.757 --> 1:42:19.134
Well, we hope it is,
but it's too early to tell.

1:42:19.218 --> 1:42:21.553
Good luck, Megan,
we're really
pulling for you here.

1:42:21.637 --> 1:42:22.805
I appreciate it.

1:42:23.889 --> 1:42:25.140
Go ahead.

1:42:27.518 --> 1:42:28.644
Hold there.

1:42:30.687 --> 1:42:32.147
I'm here for
the retirement ceremony.

1:42:32.231 --> 1:42:33.649
Head to the fields,
Corporal.

1:42:35.692 --> 1:42:36.902
There you go.

1:42:44.409 --> 1:42:45.702
Hey, I know you.

1:42:47.079 --> 1:42:52.251
Yeah, you're, uh, that
famous war hero, right,
that's on TV?

1:42:55.087 --> 1:42:56.421
Big-time Mets fan.

1:42:57.548 --> 1:42:59.925
What are you doing? Hey.

1:43:06.515 --> 1:43:07.683
You're back.

1:43:08.433 --> 1:43:10.018
Yeah, yeah.

1:43:10.102 --> 1:43:12.271
I'm, uh, here for
Chico's retirement,

1:43:12.688 --> 1:43:15.190
then I ship back out
in two days,
Camp Leatherneck.

1:43:16.108 --> 1:43:17.234
Can't get enough
of that place.

1:43:18.110 --> 1:43:20.487
After that, that's it.

1:43:21.947 --> 1:43:23.198
Time to come home.

1:43:26.410 --> 1:43:27.411
Wow.

1:43:31.248 --> 1:43:33.458
So, I hear Rex is
retiring today, too.

1:43:34.293 --> 1:43:35.460
Yeah, I...

1:43:36.628 --> 1:43:40.340
Trying to get signatures,
still trying
to bring him home.

1:43:41.466 --> 1:43:42.718
Are you gonna
get in some faces again?

1:43:42.801 --> 1:43:43.927
Start a couple brawls, maybe?

1:43:44.011 --> 1:43:45.596
Put someone in a choke hold,
knock someone out?

1:43:45.679 --> 1:43:48.056
Yeah, yeah,
if I have to, yeah.

1:43:50.976 --> 1:43:54.146
Sorry, I haven't
called you back. I...

1:43:55.439 --> 1:43:56.773
It's all good.

1:43:57.983 --> 1:43:59.318
Look,

1:44:02.237 --> 1:44:03.488

1:44:09.202 --> 1:44:11.079
At least one Marine
gets the girl in the end.

1:44:14.458 --> 1:44:16.752
You know,
you rattled every chain
in the command, right?

1:44:17.794 --> 1:44:19.630
I get to be the one
to break the big news.

1:44:21.006 --> 1:44:22.883
Better take him home
before they
change their minds.

1:44:56.041 --> 1:44:57.042
Rex!

1:45:07.970 --> 1:45:09.096

1:45:48.927 --> 1:45:50.846

You like a football?

1:45:53.432 --> 1:45:55.017
You like that, you like that?

1:45:55.100 --> 1:45:56.268
Oh, this is your
favorite one.

You've got my hand,
you've got my hand.

1:46:04.609 --> 1:46:06.862
You don't look so tough
right now, war dog.

1:46:06.945 --> 1:46:08.238
God, you're spoiled.

1:46:09.156 --> 1:46:10.157
There you go.

1:46:15.287 --> 1:46:16.538
It's okay.
