01:08.824 --> 01:10.951
Do you know the story of Hanuman?

01:12.119 --> 01:13.120
No?

01:13.954 --> 01:15.289
Look at this.

01:17.124 --> 01:18.751
Look.

01:18.751 --> 01:20.753
The story goes...

01:20.753 --> 01:22.797
When Hanuman was little...

01:22.797 --> 01:24.298
Very little...

01:24.298 --> 01:26.801
He was very hungry.

01:26.801 --> 01:28.511
So hungry.

01:28.511 --> 01:29.595
Just like you!

01:31.305 --> 01:35.518
He could have eaten any fruit
in the forest.

01:35.518 --> 01:38.395
But something cast a spell on him.

01:40.439 --> 01:42.191
High above the trees.

01:42.191 --> 01:45.361
It was a big juicy mango.

01:45.361 --> 01:46.904
So shiny.

01:48.531 --> 01:49.824
Look at this.

01:49.824 --> 01:51.325
Do you know what he did?

01:52.910 --> 01:57.248
Hanuman took to the skies.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.127
Straight towards that fruit.

02:03.295 --> 02:05.297
That juicy mango.

02:06.215 --> 02:07.842
So shiny.

02:10.636 --> 02:13.138
Only to discover...

02:13.138 --> 02:14.932
that it wasn't a mango

02:15.683 --> 02:20.145
but the burning, hot sun.

02:21.272 --> 02:23.107
The gods heard of this...

02:23.107 --> 02:25.276
and gathered to punish him.

02:27.486 --> 02:29.613
They taught him a lesson...

02:31.532 --> 02:34.827
and stripped young Hanuman of his powers.

02:37.371 --> 02:39.206
And then what happened, Ma?

06:43.283 --> 06:44.701
Aziz, just fix it, brother. Please.

07:33.709 --> 07:37.379
To live eternal, and gain immortality.

07:37.379 --> 07:39.381
A sacred gift of the Gods,
from Baba Shakti.

08:13.123 --> 08:14.708
Lucky, how's things?

08:16.960 --> 08:19.254
Boss, get him a Mango Frooti.

08:59.503 --> 09:01.797
But good luck getting anything out of her.

09:01.797 --> 09:02.965
She's a real hard-ass.

09:14.768 --> 09:20.816
Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva! For fifty rupees.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.077
Please, madam,
I haven't eaten in two days.

12:12.946 --> 12:14.489
Take it and go.

13:50.168 --> 13:52.420
Once more.

13:52.420 --> 13:55.340
Oh God, I worship you.

13:56.508 --> 13:59.052
I only worship you.

13:59.052 --> 14:01.596
You are the most powerful one.

14:02.305 --> 14:04.015
You are my saviour.

14:05.225 --> 14:07.936
I only worship you.

14:10.063 --> 14:14.693
You make us smile
and fill our hearts with love.

14:14.693 --> 14:17.571
With our eyes, with our ears.

14:17.571 --> 14:20.615
On our lips, we say your name.

14:20.615 --> 14:25.120
I sing your praise, day and night.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.125
I worship you.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.322
One regular paan.

16:37.127 --> 16:38.628
And a Raju Special.

16:45.135 --> 16:46.136
Lion!

16:46.928 --> 16:47.929
Yes.

16:47.929 --> 16:49.931
Take him.

16:49.931 --> 16:51.474
Can I go on his shoulders?

16:51.474 --> 16:53.601
How about a rickshaw, little bastard?
Take him!

16:55.437 --> 16:56.980
Solid.

16:56.980 --> 16:58.898
Come.

17:21.588 --> 17:22.756
What you got?

17:26.426 --> 17:27.427
Get inside.

18:51.636 --> 18:55.223
You want to go back to selling your ass
on the street for 500 rupees?

18:55.223 --> 18:57.475
I brought you in,
and this is how you repay me?

19:00.937 --> 19:02.188
Don't cry.

19:02.188 --> 19:05.817
As soon as Dr. Irani's back,
we'll take care of it.

19:19.372 --> 19:22.667
I made you! Now you think you can
sit on my shoulders and piss in my ear?

20:36.658 --> 20:38.368
Hey, new guy...

20:38.368 --> 20:40.578
You know what happens
to earwigs around here?

20:40.578 --> 20:42.372
You hear nothing, you see nothing. Got it?

28:22.331 --> 28:25.543
Nothing will happen. Don't lose heart.

28:28.587 --> 28:31.966
This land is now declared a holy site.

28:31.966 --> 28:34.885
You must vacate immediately!

28:34.885 --> 28:37.555
This land belongs to our ancestors.

28:37.555 --> 28:40.141
Tell him to shove these papers up his ass!

28:40.141 --> 28:42.393
Our blood is in the soil!

28:42.393 --> 28:45.062
We will never give you this land.

28:45.062 --> 28:47.022
We will never give you this land!

37:47.312 --> 37:49.606
Hey, Alphonso. Show us your leg.

37:52.359 --> 37:54.069
Fucker tried to run from a drug deal,

37:54.069 --> 37:55.779
so they chopped it off.

37:55.779 --> 37:57.656
Isn't that right?

37:57.656 --> 37:59.366
Tell me one thing.

38:00.909 --> 38:02.285
Your dick still works, huh?

38:03.453 --> 38:06.039
He doesn't need one. He's got no balls.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.127
Fuck off, go get my maal now.

39:37.422 --> 39:39.341
Gimme a towel, asshole.

39:47.808 --> 39:49.559
What the fuck is this?

39:52.354 --> 39:54.314
Blessings from my mother.

40:52.205 --> 40:55.250
I hope your mother fucks harder
than you fight.

43:52.635 --> 43:54.763
Rasul! Where the fuck are you?

43:54.763 --> 43:56.348
The attacker is in the parking lot!

44:17.452 --> 44:19.120
Wake up, asshole!

45:11.089 --> 45:12.674
Stop the car now!

50:43.713 --> 50:45.506
Run away from here!

51:27.965 --> 51:29.467
Police!

51:29.467 --> 51:31.344
This is your last warning!

52:53.509 --> 52:55.052
I only worship you.

52:55.052 --> 52:57.013
You are the most powerful one.

52:57.013 --> 52:58.389
You are my saviour.

52:58.389 --> 53:00.766
Slowly, slowly, slowly. And then?

53:00.766 --> 53:02.226
You make us smile with love.

53:02.226 --> 53:04.103
- And?
- Keep our hearts free from sin.

53:04.103 --> 53:05.187
Really good!

53:05.771 --> 53:07.356
Should we take some of these home?

53:07.356 --> 53:08.441
Yes, ok.

53:08.441 --> 53:10.443
I will make you chutney with this.

53:11.736 --> 53:14.947
Look at these roots
and how strong they are.

53:16.866 --> 53:18.326
Where do you think they go?

53:19.327 --> 53:21.120
- I don't know.
- Deep below the ground.

53:22.163 --> 53:24.916
And how do the roots grow from the ground?

53:27.293 --> 53:28.377
Show me yours.

53:30.087 --> 53:32.006
This is the first root.

53:32.006 --> 53:33.257
This is the second root.

53:33.257 --> 53:35.051
And this is the third root.

53:35.051 --> 53:39.263
So, our hands also have roots...

53:39.263 --> 53:41.807
They tell us what we'll do in the future.

53:41.807 --> 53:43.601
What will you do in the future?

58:32.681 --> 58:35.017
Don't worry about him...

58:35.017 --> 58:37.603
He's a walking corpse.

01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:11.322
This one is a story of husband and wife...

01:00:11.322 --> 01:00:12.406
Husband.

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:14.533
And wife.

01:07:00.063 --> 01:07:03.233
Brothers and Sisters!

01:07:03.233 --> 01:07:05.694
Welcome to the tale of the Ramayana.

01:07:05.694 --> 01:07:07.904
In each generation,
the story repeats itself.

01:07:12.409 --> 01:07:13.994
The captive Princess...

01:07:13.994 --> 01:07:16.621
And her fight with the Demon King.

01:07:18.206 --> 01:07:19.541
I'm Ravan!

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:23.211
Evil King, please let me go.

01:07:23.211 --> 01:07:24.629
Nobody says no to me!

01:07:28.842 --> 01:07:30.594
But then!

01:07:30.594 --> 01:07:32.137
And then came the mighty one!

01:07:32.137 --> 01:07:34.139
- Mum, that's Hanuman!
- Yes, it is.

01:07:34.139 --> 01:07:36.224
Take the first blow of my club.

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:50.530
Feel my monkey strength!

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.741
I'm Hanuman!

01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:03.293
Speak.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:07.005
Go Rana, go.

01:08:07.881 --> 01:08:10.675
Time to do God's work.

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:25.690
They're back. The Police are back.

01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:27.901
Get up. Run, everyone.

01:08:28.485 --> 01:08:30.487
Hurry, hurry.

01:08:30.487 --> 01:08:32.948
Run! We must evacuate. It's the Police.

01:09:05.897 --> 01:09:07.148
Listen to me.

01:09:07.148 --> 01:09:10.402
You go upstairs and hide.
And don't make a sound.

01:09:10.402 --> 01:09:12.696
No, no, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:15.490
Go upstairs and hide.
And don't even make a slight sound.

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:16.908
But what about you?

01:09:16.908 --> 01:09:18.410
Nothing will happen to me.

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.036
Like how a mouse hides?

01:09:20.036 --> 01:09:22.664
You hide like a mouse and make no sound.

01:09:22.664 --> 01:09:23.832
Do you trust Mum?

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:25.500
Do you trust me?

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.588
Nothing will happen. Don't lose heart.

01:09:29.588 --> 01:09:31.131
Don't lose heart.

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:32.591
You are my Hanuman.

01:09:34.843 --> 01:09:35.844
Quickly.

01:09:40.432 --> 01:09:42.017
Quickly, quickly.

01:10:05.206 --> 01:10:06.958
You've built a sweet home.

01:10:09.419 --> 01:10:11.129
What were you saying outside?

01:10:15.008 --> 01:10:17.385
Shove those papers up your ass.

01:10:17.385 --> 01:10:18.678
Is that right?

01:10:41.368 --> 01:10:42.827
Bloody whore!

01:10:45.205 --> 01:10:47.040
You'll shove it up my ass, huh?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.585
I'll show you.

01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:52.003
Get up, bitch.

01:17:20.475 --> 01:17:21.517
Get up.

01:20:47.306 --> 01:20:49.517
Victory for Mother India.

01:20:55.314 --> 01:20:58.025
Victory for Mother India!

01:28:41.822 --> 01:28:43.949
Hail the mighty one!

01:43:40.261 --> 01:43:42.013
Get up, motherfucker!

01:43:50.563 --> 01:43:52.106
You son of a whore.

01:43:54.317 --> 01:43:55.526
What are you looking at?

01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:05.615
Get up!

01:52:21.073 --> 01:52:23.951
Oh God, I worship you.

01:52:24.702 --> 01:52:26.912
I only worship you.

01:52:27.788 --> 01:52:30.416
You are the most powerful one.

01:52:32.084 --> 01:52:34.295
You are my saviour.

01:52:36.422 --> 01:52:38.340
You make us smile.

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:41.677
And fill our hearts with love.

01:52:41.677 --> 01:52:44.847
All around the world. In my heart.

01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:49.518
In my home. You are everywhere.

01:52:50.102 --> 01:52:53.981
In every root, and every drop of water.

01:52:55.649 --> 01:52:59.403
With our eyes. With our ears.

01:52:59.403 --> 01:53:01.780
On our lips. We say your name.

01:53:03.574 --> 01:53:07.912
I sing your praise, day and night.

01:53:20.341 --> 01:53:22.968
Oh God, I worship you.

01:53:42.947 --> 01:53:46.617
Oh God, I worship you.
