00:01.793 --> 00:03.795
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:33.450 --> 00:34.617
138.

00:35.618 --> 00:40.040
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.168
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.422
Because the fight needed to be fought.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.180
-SOLDIER: Bogey spotted!
-Get me Colonel Rhodes down here now!

00:55.263 --> 00:56.890
MAJOR ALLEN:
What are we dealing with here?

00:56.973 --> 01:00.101
-The Iron Man weapon.
-My device does not fit that description.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.021
STERN: It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.
I hate to inform you.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.690
If your priority
was actually the well-being of...

01:05.774 --> 01:09.402
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon
turned over to the people of the U.S.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.528
(CROWD MURMURING)

01:10.612 --> 01:12.739
Hey, buddy. Didn't expect to see you here.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.742
Look, it's me. I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.954
For the record, can you please
read page 57, paragraph four.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.957
You want me read specific selections
from my report, Senator?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.042
Yes, sir.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.795
It was my understanding
that I was going to testify

01:26.878 --> 01:28.213
in a more detailed manner.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.672
A lot of things have changed.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.384
Reading a single paragraph out of context
does not reflect my findings.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.386
Just read it, Colonel. I do.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.471
Thank you.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.017
As he does not operate
within any definable branch of government,

01:41.101 --> 01:44.896
Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation,

01:45.396 --> 01:46.481
and to her interests.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.984
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.945
Somebody else had it yesterday.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.198
It's working. America is secure.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.950
You can't have my property.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.994
They're gonna take your suits.
They're sick of the games.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.288
You don't deserve to wear one of these.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.333
STARK: Think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

02:05.416 --> 02:08.378
You wanna do this whole
lone gunslinger act.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.338
You don't have to do this alone.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.298
(GRUNTS)

02:16.136 --> 02:18.346
STARK: You kicked ass.
WAR MACHINE: Thank you. You too.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.224
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

02:21.307 --> 02:23.268
so I'm gonna have to
hang on to your suit.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.978
Not okay. Not okay with that.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.729
Wasn't a question.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.525
Colonel James Rhodes. The Iron Patriot.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.611
"War Machine" was aggressive.
This sends a better message.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.738
All right. Let's go.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.658
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

02:38.741 --> 02:39.993
They'll kill the president.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.412
Mr. President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.958
People are concerned about you.
I'm concerned about you.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.751
I've come to save the world.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.503
He's in your files
and the Internet.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.633
Ultron says the Avengers are the only
thing between him and global destruction.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.469
RHODES: The Pentagon is scared.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.097
After New York, aliens... Come on.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.812
These Accords. I signed because
it was the right thing to do.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.609
Congratulations, Cap.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.693
You're a criminal.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.241
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you,
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.624
All right, now I'm pissed.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.127
(GRUNTING)

03:31.753 --> 03:33.838
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.632
Give me back my Rhodey.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.892
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.561
Rhodes!

03:50.730 --> 03:52.774
RHODES: Yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

03:53.858 --> 03:54.859
This is a bad beat.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.948
GENERAL ROSS: I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.366
I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.705
You know they're only criminals because
you've chosen to call them that.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.249
Arrest them.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.670
EBONY MAW: You are about to die
at the hands of Thanos.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.173
-Should we bow?
-Yeah, he's a king.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.300
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:19.384 --> 04:22.095
-What are you doing?
-We don't do that here.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.515
Back up, Sam.
You're gonna get your wings singed.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.977
Focus that fire on the left flank.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.948
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.119
We lost.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.291
Oh, God.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.626
WAR MACHINE: What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.336
RHODES: If we can do this, you know...

04:55.420 --> 04:57.755
go back in time,
why don't we just find baby Thanos?

04:57.839 --> 04:58.840
You know, and...

05:03.094 --> 05:05.179
-First of all, that's horrible.
-RHODES: It's Thanos.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.390
BANNER: And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.599
RHODES: This is known.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.602
BANNER: I don't know why everyone
believes that, but that isn't true.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.605
ROGERS: Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.400
Get the stones. Get them back.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.777
This is the fight of our lives...

05:19.902 --> 05:21.696
Are you telling me this actually worked?

05:23.698 --> 05:24.699
ROGERS: Bruce!

05:27.118 --> 05:28.453
I think it worked.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.042
(WAR MACHINE YELPING)

05:35.835 --> 05:39.255
What I'm about to do
to your annoying little planet...

05:39.339 --> 05:40.423
I'm gonna enjoy it...

05:40.506 --> 05:41.966
See you on the other side, man.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.051
(ROCKET WHIMPERING)

05:43.134 --> 05:44.927
ANT-MAN: Hang on! I'm coming!

05:48.598 --> 05:50.433
RHODES: World's a crazy place right now.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.976
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Avengers...

05:52.060 --> 05:53.353
RHODES: Nobody's stable.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.483
Everybody's just looking
for somebody to fix it.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.819
It's a new day, brother.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.491
Now this is gonna be a good story.
