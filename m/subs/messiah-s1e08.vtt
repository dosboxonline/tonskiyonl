00:17.267 --> 00:18.560
[al-Masih] Mr. President.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.066
[door closes]

00:25.608 --> 00:26.568
[outer door closes]

00:31.531 --> 00:33.908
This will be a confidential conversation.

00:34.492 --> 00:35.702
I'm sure you understand.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.706
You think it would reflect badly on you
to meet with me.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.750
But still, you're meeting with me.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.626
You don't seem at all surprised.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.464
-By any of this.
-You are why I came to Washington.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.718
So you knew we were gonna come
take you in the night?

00:51.801 --> 00:54.929
We would always find this moment,
one way or the other.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.640
This is our destiny.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.642
Is it?

01:01.436 --> 01:02.270
Why?

01:04.022 --> 01:06.399
We are sitting here, aren't we?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.527
What is it you want?

01:12.113 --> 01:13.448
Your consideration.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.576
Well, I'm sitting here, aren't I?

01:19.287 --> 01:20.872
You were once a warrior.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.876
You have seen the pain of war.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.003
Up close.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.840
And you know the cycle of history.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.968
Blood brings blood, on and on...

01:34.552 --> 01:36.971
for generations, until it is an ocean.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.683
So you've come
with a prepared speech, have you?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.478
Is that... how this will go?

01:47.148 --> 01:48.733
Tell me why you've come here.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.905
How far would you go to bring about
a thousand years of peace?

01:57.909 --> 02:00.912
I would do anything, but it is impossible.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.914
Not only possible but simple.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.959
Withdraw all American troops.

02:07.001 --> 02:08.586
-From where?
-Everywhere.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.089
Are you serious?

02:11.172 --> 02:12.674
Bring them all home.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.136
Every man, every woman, every person.

02:17.554 --> 02:21.224
If you do this, you'll be remembered
as the president of peace.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.269
This is...

02:25.019 --> 02:26.437
very naive.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.191
Our troops abroad...

02:30.275 --> 02:32.986
for the most part,
are a peacekeeping measure.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.946
To withdraw them would be disastrous.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.449
It would only encourage rogue states
and marauding groups to strike.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.954
Where I am from, a hundred years ago...

02:43.496 --> 02:46.291
Europeans drew lines on paper

02:46.875 --> 02:48.376
and called them borders.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.754
America has enforced those lines

02:51.838 --> 02:54.757
and given strength to brutal dictators.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.719
-You know that to be true.
-You can't hold Americans accountable

02:57.802 --> 02:59.971
-for the actions of other leaders.
-M Lai.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.931
No Gun Ri.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.600
Azizabad.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.226
Haditha.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.146
Abu Ghraib.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.109
Your forces haven't always kept the peace.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.196
Those are all deeply regrettable
and isolated incidents.

03:16.279 --> 03:20.325
Our presence on the world stage
has always been a stabilizing influence.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.660
And always will be, you can't deny that.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.037
Just one example:

03:24.120 --> 03:28.166
Russia has been massing forces
on their border with Latvia and Estonia.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.211
If we were to evacuate our forces nearby,

03:31.294 --> 03:34.214
Russia would be emboldened
and might invade Eastern Europe.

03:34.297 --> 03:37.550
-You don't know that would happen.
-I've got a pretty good idea.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.303
-History tells me.
-There is no more history.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.596
History has ended.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.681
There is only now.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.393
I don't think you understand...

03:47.977 --> 03:49.103
what you're asking.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.273
I understand perfectly well.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.068
Well, then, if that's true,
I question your motives.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.527
I only have one master.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.780
We know a lot more about you
than you think we do.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.699
Whatever you know,
it doesn't change a thing.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.410
The world is about to begin again

04:04.494 --> 04:06.454
and you need to do your part.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.252
I can't see how
what you're asking would help.

04:12.335 --> 04:16.047
You cannot see what is to come,
you have to act on faith.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.675
If you don't...

04:20.051 --> 04:21.636
a heavy price will be paid.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.098
Is that supposed to be
some sort of threat?

04:26.516 --> 04:27.642
A warning.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.229
Ah, this is nonsense.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.567
Let me ask you this.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.947
Do you call yourself a Latter-day Saint?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.449
[sighs]

04:45.743 --> 04:46.619
I do.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.706
Do you believe in God?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.084
Yes, I do.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.588
So these are the latter days?

05:00.174 --> 05:01.175
They are.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.513
Do you believe God would go silent?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.726
That he would abandon you?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.982
Or do you believe
he still speaks to humanity?

05:19.902 --> 05:21.904
I believe he still speaks.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.702
He's speaking to you now.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.390
[squelching]

06:01.361 --> 06:03.237
[seabirds calling]

06:21.631 --> 06:23.800
[Bailey] <i>So, Golshiri is</i>
<i>a trained magician?</i>

06:23.883 --> 06:26.427
The brother also claimed
that he was involuntarily committed

06:26.511 --> 06:28.221
at the Tehran Psychiatric Hospital.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.305
What for?

06:29.931 --> 06:31.557
I have an agent looking into it.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.185
That's just the kind of stuff
Collier's looking for.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.313
Let's just keep it in house
for now, though.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.357
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-</i>Where are you now?

06:40.608 --> 06:42.151
Digging a little deeper.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.865
[man] I don't see the connection.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.159
He was only a student here
for one semester.

06:50.993 --> 06:56.457
I don't see anything with Wallace.
No, uh... courses. No... social clubs.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.460
No study groups.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.712
Nothing.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.381
You're sure?

07:04.215 --> 07:06.717
It's a wholly unremarkable record.

07:07.927 --> 07:13.307
Two intro survey courses,
one seminar on international relations.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.185
Reasonable grades.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.397
There's no other documentation
on Golshiri?

07:21.816 --> 07:24.694
Well, he was in an advanced seminar,

07:24.777 --> 07:26.654
which requires a final term paper.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.448
40 pages minimum. We...

07:29.574 --> 07:30.491
We, uh...

07:31.075 --> 07:33.744
have them bound
to keep them all in the library.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.706
So you'd have a copy of Golshiri's paper.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.667
Presumably.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.043
I'd like to see that.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.838
Now, please.

07:45.089 --> 07:50.052
"Transformational Politics - A New Era,"
Payam Golshiri.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.890
Golshiri, let's see.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.809
Golshiri.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.270
It should be...

08:00.354 --> 08:01.397
right...

08:03.649 --> 08:04.525
It...

08:07.487 --> 08:08.362
Huh.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.865
...seems to be missing.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.411
It probably got moved somewhere.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.871
Don't worry, we'll find it.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.128
No, I don't think we're supposed to.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.967
[phone rings]

08:30.510 --> 08:32.386
-Hey.
-[man] <i>Hey.</i>

08:34.055 --> 08:35.223
Just saw your text.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.309
<i>Yeah, sorry. I...</i>

08:38.893 --> 08:40.061
<i>I know it was late.</i>

08:41.395 --> 08:42.396
<i>It's fine.</i>

08:43.147 --> 08:44.023
What's up?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.361
I just think I'm lyin' to myself.

08:51.447 --> 08:52.657
What do you mean?

08:54.116 --> 08:55.368
[sighs] <i>I just...</i>

08:56.577 --> 08:58.913
When I stopped pretendin'
about who I was, I...

08:59.455 --> 09:01.791
I just thought everythin'
would become a lot...

09:02.917 --> 09:03.918
easier.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.088
<i>A lot of things are easier.</i>

09:08.422 --> 09:10.174
We're just tryin' to make our way.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.301
You and me.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.513
It's not the answer to everythin'.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.764
[man sighs]

09:16.847 --> 09:18.891
[laughs] <i>Never said it would be.</i>

09:21.477 --> 09:22.770
Bigger things than us.

09:24.021 --> 09:24.855
<i>Huh.</i>

09:25.815 --> 09:27.275
Well, I forgot that.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.027
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

09:32.196 --> 09:33.614
Yeah, I just needed to talk.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.828
I... I should go.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.289
Well, good talk.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.916
I love you.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
<i>I love you too.</i>

09:48.879 --> 09:49.714
Bye.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.765
[in Arabic] Did he really walk on water?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.935
It happened far away.
It's difficult to know.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.649
We are here now, aren't we?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.153
And there are problems
right in front of us.

10:14.322 --> 10:18.200
The other refugees, the ones you led...
and the rest of Palestine...

10:20.286 --> 10:24.290
I would ask you
to read this statement in public.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.251
You are a hero, Jibril...

10:34.675 --> 10:37.178
and your voice can be powerful
and influential.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.391
You want me to say all this?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.645
I urge you to look it over.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.361
We believe that we have
the right of sovereignty...

10:53.444 --> 10:56.322
and the right to be free of occupation.

10:56.739 --> 11:02.912
This is something you must understand...

11:03.663 --> 11:06.499
after living in Yarmouk your whole life.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.503
We need to be recognized, as a nation.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.305
Hm?

11:22.807 --> 11:23.766
What's wrong?

11:25.601 --> 11:26.727
Do you not agree?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.856
I don't know how to read.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.250
[sighs]

12:07.393 --> 12:08.894
There's only one book.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.368
It's time to put away childish things.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.712
[door closes]

12:40.426 --> 12:43.596
Listen, I know there was Secret Service
in the hotel last night.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.265
So, either you give me a statement
that helps shape the narrative...

12:46.348 --> 12:47.558
-[commotion]
-[man] al-Masih!

12:48.184 --> 12:49.977
-Guys, guys...
-al-Masih!

12:51.562 --> 12:54.148
-[man 2] al-Masih.
-[man] We have questions for you.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.317
-[woman] al-Masih!
-Come on.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.700
-I hear you have some questions.
-[all yelling]

13:04.784 --> 13:06.911
-[woman 2] Why Washington?
-[man] Who do you represent?

13:06.994 --> 13:08.287
Did you really walk on water?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.748
Don't you trust your eyes?

13:11.165 --> 13:12.291
What did you see?

13:12.374 --> 13:15.503
A lot of people are calling you a hoax.
Do you have a response?

13:17.129 --> 13:20.007
I am real, if that's what you're asking.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.721
You can touch me if you need proof.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.481
-I can confirm he exists.
-[laughter]

13:35.564 --> 13:37.483
Are you a Democrat or Republican?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.443
I am not running for office.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.153
Why do people call you "al-Masih"?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.156
Because it's what they've chosen
to call me.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
-[man] Why have you chosen--
-[Miriam] Are you the Messiah?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.248
I am a message.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.458
No, answer the question.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.378
Are you the Messiah?

13:59.463 --> 14:02.216
I am here to bring about
the world to come.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.426
-[man] How do you like DC?
-[woman] But that's vague.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.824
[vase smashes]

14:28.367 --> 14:30.452
You said you stand at the gate
of a new nation.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.955
Was that a metaphor or a call to arms?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.331
It's not a metaphor.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.502
Is that why you brought
all these people here, for revolution?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.212
I...

14:41.714 --> 14:43.591
I didn't bring them. They followed.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.634
That's semantics. They're here now.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.971
Why come to DC?
What are you going to do here?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.183
Last night I met with President Young.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.935
-[exclamations]
-[woman] Wow...

14:55.019 --> 14:57.646
We discussed how to achieve world peace.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.899
-[woman] Where did you meet?
-[Miriam] What did you say?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.318
-[man] Alone?
-[woman] Why wasn't the press invited?

15:04.445 --> 15:07.072
It was a constructive conversation.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.159
You'll have to ask the president
to elaborate on specifics.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.118
[Miriam] No, why was--

15:11.201 --> 15:13.203
<i>Why was this meeting held in secret?</i>

15:13.996 --> 15:15.748
[Collier] Tell me this isn't true.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.668
-I'd hoped he didn't go public.
-Why didn't you consult me?

15:20.252 --> 15:22.129
'Cause I knew what you'd say.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.381
We have to put out a statement.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.176
Damage control.
Distance you from this crackpot.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.012
We don't know what he wants.
We don't know who sent him.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.265
<i>-</i>Think of the optics.
-I don't care about the optics.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.768
Ball's in our court now.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.730
I need to take some time
and think about how to respond.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.651
Maybe we can make some good out of this.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.444
Are you kidding? "Good"?

15:45.527 --> 15:48.364
What, did he offer you
some golden plates he dug up?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.532
You need to pull yourself together.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.202
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.996
You know that I respect your faith.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.889

-Agent Rhymer.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.855
-Where's Mathers?
-He left.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.484
-So you've been on Golshiri, then?
-Yeah.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.237
So tell me, how is it possible
that he met with the president?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.573
He moved around a lot last night.
Left the hotel.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.368
We were on him until Secret Service
took him for a couple of hours.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.453
-Why wasn't I notified?
-It was need-to-know.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.580
Well, now the whole goddamn world knows.

I know.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.799
You know, I... I...

16:49.466 --> 16:52.344
I could have at least
set up the press conference for you.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.638
We could have had more reporters there,
a bigger audience.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.724
God's message is reaching the world.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.517
[Felix sighs]

17:00.019 --> 17:02.604
You asked me to guide us from Texas,

17:02.688 --> 17:04.356
and we ended up in Washington.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.150
That feels like it was
the right move, right?

17:06.233 --> 17:09.403
-It was.
-So you trusted me with that, but now...

17:09.945 --> 17:11.530
what, I'm out of the loop?

17:13.073 --> 17:14.450
I didn't need you for this.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.951
Why not?

17:17.911 --> 17:19.121
What are you asking me?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.790
-What is my part in all this?
-Only you know that.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.375
-And how do I know that?
-Pray.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.378
Pray? To who?
Aren't you supposed to be God?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.214
Do you believe that?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.135
Then kneel down, Felix.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.709
Wh... what are you doing?

18:07.461 --> 18:08.629
Goin' back to Texas.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.256
Why? Did they ask you to go back?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.175
No. It was my choice.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.970
-Just... done all I can do here.
-No. I need you to stay here.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.224
You've been watching Golshiri,

18:20.891 --> 18:22.017
Yes, I do.

-Nothing.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.294
Nothing?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.838
What was he working on?

18:52.798 --> 18:53.799
What's this?

18:54.299 --> 18:58.137
Call logs to and from phone booths
from Texas to DC.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.639
-You asked for those.
-Can I get them in digital?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.808
That's what they gave me.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.980
You're a guest in this investigation.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.708
<i>This is a diplomatic nightmare.</i>

19:27.791 --> 19:29.543
I advised the president against it,

<i>but he's his own man, as you well know.</i>

19:31.712 --> 19:33.380
You could have given me a warning.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.798
<i>Well, it's happened already.</i>

19:35.340 --> 19:37.759
It's time the two of us
dealt with this ourselves.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.261
<i>What does that mean?</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:41.471
You do want this problem to go away,
don't you, Danny?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.015
You know I do.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.935
Then I need you to set up
a back channel to Israel.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.294
No, thank you.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.221
You didn't tell me you had a brother.

Hm?

when everybody's watching

20:35.108 --> 20:36.485

20:38.737 --> 20:41.073
There is no crime in having a brother.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.326
So you don't deny having a brother...

20:46.245 --> 20:47.788
No. [chuckles]

20:51.667 --> 20:53.543

I do not pretend to be anyone.

Okay.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.656

22:05.699 --> 22:07.743
Let me know when you have seen enough.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.955
And you should call your daughter.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.260
[President] I thought
we had an understanding

22:25.344 --> 22:27.471
that our meeting was
to be just between us.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.599
That didn't suit my purposes.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.810
Why did you want to see me again?

22:36.271 --> 22:38.273
Has the angel not visited you?

22:39.441 --> 22:41.193
I have seen no angel.

Has he not told you
of the one mighty and strong?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.242
I... I... don't understand.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.788
Have you made up your mind, John?

22:54.706 --> 22:56.625
I just need a little more time to think,

31:24.549 --> 31:25.758
It just can't.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.935
You're just as fucked up as me.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.549
[knocking at door]

32:41.250 --> 32:42.502
[in Arabic] Who are you?

32:45.171 --> 32:46.839
I will be your wife.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.973
[distant siren wailing]

32:58.643 --> 33:00.269
So... what did you want?

33:02.397 --> 33:03.314
Take it.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.524
I don't want it.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.278
It's all there.

33:14.117 --> 33:14.951
Good.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.954
'Cause you didn't do your fuckin' job.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.791
I don't want you to call me ever again.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.801
Are you really so stupid
as to believe him?

33:33.720 --> 33:36.431
Can't you of all people tell
when someone's faking it?

33:38.725 --> 33:40.393
Doesn't matter if he's real.

33:42.020 --> 33:42.854
He's good.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.111
What the fuck do you know about good?

34:00.705 --> 34:02.123
[door opens]

34:45.333 --> 34:48.169
[Young] <i>My heart breaks for those</i>
<i>whose lives have been affected.</i>

34:49.045 --> 34:51.672
Beyond the physical damage
to infrastructure,

34:51.756 --> 34:53.216
to businesses, to homes...

34:54.842 --> 34:57.678
the human cost is staggering.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.226
In order to free up funds, I've declared
a federal state of emergency.

35:03.309 --> 35:06.437
We're doing everything we can.
I ask that we all pray,

35:06.521 --> 35:07.730
and ask God...

35:09.148 --> 35:10.274
for...

35:10.900 --> 35:12.110
uh...

35:12.819 --> 35:13.820
for, uh...

35:16.739 --> 35:20.284
I ask that you all join me in praying
for those in danger.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.956
May God guide us and protect us
during these difficult times.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.959
[crowd chanting outside]

35:30.128 --> 35:31.754
[door opens]

35:38.845 --> 35:40.513
You wanted to speak with me?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.852
I want to know who you really are.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.105
You don't know who I am?

35:49.647 --> 35:50.982
Actually, I don't.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.986
And that's really starting
to feel like a problem.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.911
What are you afraid of?

36:09.041 --> 36:11.002
Why did you choose my family?

36:12.879 --> 36:14.630
Why are we here with you?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.591
Your faith.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.217
Our faith?

36:19.385 --> 36:21.262
Maybe we have you fooled too.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.975
Faith can be found
in the most unlikely places.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.855
Is that what you see in my daughter?

36:32.148 --> 36:33.191
Faith?

36:34.734 --> 36:35.985
Rebecca...

36:36.903 --> 36:40.323
-is at the beginning of a long path.
-That's not good enough.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.742
I need to know what you want with her.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.578
She's just a child, you know.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.832
You are a mother lion, Anna.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.962
You want to protect her
and keep her close, I understand.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.507
But she will be her own person
one day soon,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
and you will need to let her go.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.056
What do you want with her?

37:07.683 --> 37:11.187
Are you worried about your daughter?
Or are you worried about yourself?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.773
I'm worried about you.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.316
About what you want.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.571
I only want what God wants.

37:29.538 --> 37:31.499
And what is it that God wants?

37:32.458 --> 37:34.460
[crowd chanting] al-Masih! al-Masih!

37:35.920 --> 37:37.421
He wants the flood.
