WEBVTT

01:19.087 --> 01:20.046
Surprise!

01:23.800 --> 01:27.636
Alex. Do not interrupt
me when I'm daydreaming.

01:27.637 --> 01:29.972
When a zebra's in the
zone, leave him alone.

01:29.973 --> 01:32.892
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a Happy Birthday.

01:32.976 --> 01:35.103
Hey, man, thanks.

01:36.813 --> 01:40.066
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

01:40.149 --> 01:42.985
It's driving me crazy. Can you
help me out here? Please?

01:42.986 --> 01:45.321
You came to the right
place, my friend.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.449
Dr. Marty, D.D.S.,
is in the house.

01:48.533 --> 01:53.579
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

01:55.206 --> 01:57.834
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.127
Oh, sorry.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.796
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

02:02.964 --> 02:06.384
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

02:06.467 --> 02:07.885
Happy Birthday!

02:07.969 --> 02:10.346
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

02:10.430 --> 02:13.558
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

02:13.641 --> 02:16.560
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out. Check it out.

02:16.561 --> 02:21.399
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

02:21.482 --> 02:23.943
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

02:24.027 --> 02:26.321
Double digits. The big 1-0.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.198
You don't like it?

02:30.199 --> 02:32.534
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

02:32.535 --> 02:36.371
I should've gotten you the Alex alarm clock.
That's the big seller.

02:36.372 --> 02:39.334
No, no, no. The present's
great, really.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.086
It's just that another
year's come and gone

02:42.170 --> 02:44.213
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

02:44.297 --> 02:49.135
"Stand over here. Trot over there. Eat some grass.
Walk back over here."

02:49.218 --> 02:51.971
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

02:52.055 --> 02:54.724
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

02:54.807 --> 02:56.767
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

02:56.768 --> 02:58.352
Get out there. Who knows
what you're gonna do.

02:58.353 --> 02:59.812
Make it up as you go along.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.815
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

03:02.899 --> 03:05.151
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

03:05.234 --> 03:07.612
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

03:07.695 --> 03:08.738
Works for me.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.078
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

03:16.079 --> 03:17.830
It's fun people fun time!

03:17.914 --> 03:21.709
Let's go, Gloria! Up and at 'em.
We're open!

03:22.710 --> 03:23.753
What day is it?

03:23.836 --> 03:26.296
It's Friday. Field trip day.

03:26.297 --> 03:29.550
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

03:29.759 --> 03:31.386
...in ten more minutes.

03:33.262 --> 03:34.347
Come on!

03:34.430 --> 03:37.308
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

03:37.392 --> 03:41.646
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

03:41.729 --> 03:43.105
Let's go.

03:43.106 --> 03:46.109
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

03:46.192 --> 03:50.196
I found another brown spot on my shoulder.
Right here. See?

03:50.279 --> 03:52.281
Right there. You see?

03:52.365 --> 03:55.493
Melman, you know it's
all in your head. Hm?

03:55.576 --> 03:57.412
Let's go! Come on!

04:09.799 --> 04:13.261
Phil! Wake up, you
filthy monkey.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.808
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

04:18.891 --> 04:22.687
Straight out the ground. Tasty fresh!
Freshalicious.

04:24.814 --> 04:26.024
Ziploc fresh.

04:26.107 --> 04:28.817
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

04:28.818 --> 04:31.154
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

04:31.237 --> 04:33.072
Show them the cat.
Who's the cat?

04:33.156 --> 04:35.490
The King of New York City.

04:35.491 --> 04:38.036
Alex the lion.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.288
It's showtime.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.919
Roar!

04:56.929 --> 05:00.683
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

05:00.767 --> 05:04.479
Check out the zebra taking care of biz.
That's right.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.555
Just smile and wave, boys.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.433
Smile and wave.

05:42.517 --> 05:44.686
Kowalski, progress report.

05:45.228 --> 05:47.438
We're only 500 feet from
the main sewer line.

05:47.522 --> 05:50.565
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

05:50.566 --> 05:51.901
Right.

05:52.527 --> 05:55.530
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

05:55.738 --> 06:00.118
And find more Popsicle sticks. We
don't want to risk another cave-in.

06:00.201 --> 06:01.452
And me, skipper?

06:01.536 --> 06:04.580
I want you to look cute
and cuddly, private.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.082
Today we're going
to blow this dump.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.752
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

06:13.881 --> 06:16.676
Yeah! You don't see
that on Animal Planet.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.469
Ha-ha.

06:18.553 --> 06:22.473
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

06:22.557 --> 06:24.933
I hope you thought it was fresh.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.477
I'll be here all week.

06:26.561 --> 06:29.147
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

06:29.230 --> 06:31.566
Three hundred and
sixty-five days a year,

06:31.691 --> 06:35.611
including Christmas, Hanukkah,
Halloween, Kwanzaa.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.240
Please don't forget to never
spay or neuter your pets.

06:39.949 --> 06:43.244
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

06:49.709 --> 06:53.128
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

06:53.129 --> 06:54.796
I sprechen.

06:54.797 --> 06:57.967
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.970
Hoover Dam! We're
still in New York.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.264
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

07:03.348 --> 07:05.600
Hey. You in the tux.
Wait a minute.

07:06.184 --> 07:08.185
What are you guys doing?

07:08.186 --> 07:10.021
We're digging to Antarctica.

07:10.938 --> 07:12.273
Ant-who-tica?

07:12.940 --> 07:15.943
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

07:19.113 --> 07:23.284
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

07:23.368 --> 07:28.497
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

07:28.498 --> 07:31.875
This is all some kind of
whacked-out conspiracy.

07:31.876 --> 07:35.922
We're going to the wide-open
spaces of Antarctica.

07:36.005 --> 07:37.423
To the wild.

07:39.092 --> 07:42.887
The wild? You could
actually go there?

07:42.971 --> 07:44.305
That sounds great.

07:46.099 --> 07:50.061
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

07:50.895 --> 07:53.690
You didn't see anything.

07:53.773 --> 07:54.856
Right?

07:54.857 --> 07:56.567
Yes, sir.

07:56.651 --> 07:58.319
I'm sorry. No, sir.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.865
For his final
appearance of the day,

08:03.032 --> 08:06.035
the King of New York City.

08:06.202 --> 08:07.787
Alex the lion.

08:07.996 --> 08:09.664
Roar!

08:13.376 --> 08:15.378
Thank you. Thank you very much.

08:15.461 --> 08:19.090
You guys are great. You're a great crowd.
Give yourselves a hand.

08:19.173 --> 08:21.467
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

08:21.551 --> 08:23.261
Oh! Well. Thank you.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.680
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

08:28.349 --> 08:29.475
Underpants!

08:29.559 --> 08:32.687
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.356
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.700
This is the life.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.869
That's the spot.

08:47.952 --> 08:49.787
Oh! I'm in heaven.

08:59.672 --> 09:02.424
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

09:02.425 --> 09:05.595
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

09:05.678 --> 09:06.971
A thermometer.

09:07.055 --> 09:10.933
Thanks. I love it, Melman.
I love it.

09:11.893 --> 09:13.977
Yeah, I wanted to give
you something personal.

09:13.978 --> 09:16.481
You know, that was my
first rectal thermometer.

09:16.564 --> 09:18.650
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.401
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

09:24.113 --> 09:25.990
Happy Birthday to you.

09:26.074 --> 09:27.992
You live in a zoo.

09:28.076 --> 09:30.452
You look like a monkey.

09:30.453 --> 09:33.289
And you smell like one too

09:35.124 --> 09:36.501
I say.

09:38.169 --> 09:41.171
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

09:41.172 --> 09:42.507
And yourselves.

09:42.590 --> 09:44.968
What are you talking about?
We worked on that all week.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.845
Let's go. Let's make
a wish, babycakes.

09:53.518 --> 09:56.478
- Come on. What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

09:56.479 --> 09:57.647
Come on. Tell.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.066
No siree. I'm telling
you, it's bad luck.

10:00.149 --> 10:02.485
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

10:02.568 --> 10:05.112
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

10:05.113 --> 10:08.032
Would you just tell us? I mean, really.
What could happen?

10:08.116 --> 10:09.367
Okay.

10:09.450 --> 10:13.746
I wished I could go to the wild!

10:13.830 --> 10:15.039
The wild?!

10:18.835 --> 10:20.461
I told you it was bad luck.

10:22.338 --> 10:24.214
The wild? Are you nuts?

10:24.215 --> 10:27.302
That is the worst
idea I've ever heard.

10:29.637 --> 10:31.179
It's unsanitary.

10:31.180 --> 10:34.349
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

10:34.350 --> 10:35.893
The penguins are psychotic.

10:35.977 --> 10:39.355
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

10:39.439 --> 10:43.443
Back to your roots. Clean
air, wide-open spaces!

10:43.526 --> 10:46.194
Well, I hear they have wide-open
spaces in Connecticut.

10:46.195 --> 10:47.112
Connecticut?

10:47.113 --> 10:49.489
Yeah. What you gotta do is you
go over to Grand Central.

10:49.490 --> 10:52.744
And then you gotta take the
Metro-North train... north?

10:52.827 --> 10:57.040
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.083
Marty come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

11:00.084 --> 11:02.044
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

11:02.045 --> 11:03.296
No, no really, really.
I just want...

11:03.379 --> 11:05.298
There's certainly none
of this in the wild.

11:05.381 --> 11:08.760
This is a highly refined
type of food thing

11:08.843 --> 11:10.719
that you do not
find in the wild.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.973
You ever thought there might be
more to life than steak, Alex?

11:14.057 --> 11:16.893
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

11:16.976 --> 11:20.646
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

11:20.647 --> 11:23.107
about life outside this zoo?

11:24.984 --> 11:26.235
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.947
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

11:30.615 --> 11:33.743
You got a little schmutz
right there on your...

11:38.289 --> 11:42.752
Thanks, guys. Thanks for the party.
It was great.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.045
Really.

11:51.886 --> 11:53.095
What's eating him?

11:53.096 --> 11:54.805
Maybe you should
talk to him Alex.

11:54.806 --> 11:57.099
You know, go over there and
give him a little pep talk.

11:57.100 --> 12:01.019
Hey, I already gave him a snow globe.
I can't top that.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.232
- Alex.
- I can see where this is going.

12:05.108 --> 12:07.944
It is getting late. I
guess I'm going to...

12:18.413 --> 12:20.498
Come on. He's your best friend.

12:20.581 --> 12:23.625
All right, all right. Okay.

12:23.626 --> 12:26.254
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

12:49.193 --> 12:50.903
What a day.

12:50.987 --> 12:51.904
I mean, just really...

12:51.988 --> 12:52.946
Really I mean I tell you,

12:52.947 --> 12:55.908
it just doesn't get any
better than this, you know?

12:56.951 --> 13:00.079
Ooh! It just did.
Even the star's out.

13:01.289 --> 13:04.166
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.209
Helicopter.

13:09.172 --> 13:10.840
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.007
Everybody has days

13:12.008 --> 13:14.552
when they think the grass might
be greener somewhere else.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.220
Alex.

13:17.305 --> 13:18.556
Look at me.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.683
I'm ten years old. My
life is half over.

13:21.684 --> 13:24.354
And I don't even know if I'm
black with white stripes...

13:24.437 --> 13:27.649
...or white with black stripes.

13:33.321 --> 13:34.530
Marty.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.950
I'm thinking of a song.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.869
Alex. Please. Not now.

13:39.952 --> 13:43.831
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song. I
think you're familiar with it.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.044
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.671
I'm not listening.

13:51.422 --> 13:53.299
Start spreadin' the news

13:53.383 --> 13:54.467
I don't know you.

13:54.550 --> 13:57.220
I'm leaving today.

13:57.303 --> 14:02.016
- We are a great big part of it.
- He's funny. Who is that?

14:02.934 --> 14:05.561
Come on. You know
you know the words.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.730
Two little words.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.064
New York.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.692
New York.

14:10.775 --> 14:13.903
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

14:13.987 --> 14:15.822
We're not all
nocturnal, you know!

14:15.905 --> 14:18.449
I'll knock your "turnal"
right off, pal.

14:18.533 --> 14:20.743
Yeah, you and what
army, stripes?

14:20.827 --> 14:23.705
You mess with him, you
mess with me, Howard.

14:23.788 --> 14:27.417
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.794
We make a great team,
the two of us.

14:29.877 --> 14:32.587
We sure do. No doubt about it.

14:32.588 --> 14:33.588
So, what are you going to do?

14:33.589 --> 14:36.092
Just go running off to
the wild by yourself?

14:36.259 --> 14:37.302
- No.
- Good.

14:37.385 --> 14:39.012
You and me. Let's go.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.262
- What?
- The wild.

14:40.263 --> 14:42.639
Come on. You and me together.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.143
It's a straight shot down Fifth
Avenue to Grand Central.

14:46.144 --> 14:48.146
We'll grab a train,
we'll head north.

14:48.229 --> 14:50.898
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

14:50.982 --> 14:53.192
You're joking. Right?

14:56.070 --> 15:00.824
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking.
Give me a break.

15:00.825 --> 15:02.493
Like we're going to get a train.

15:04.078 --> 15:06.789
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

15:06.873 --> 15:10.835
Oh, well. I guess
I'll hit the sack.

15:10.918 --> 15:14.464
Yeah, me too. I'll need to
rest my voice for tomorrow.

15:14.964 --> 15:18.217
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

15:18.301 --> 15:21.137
Give them a little jolt. You
know what I'm talking about?

15:22.388 --> 15:24.307
Good night, Ally Al.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.944
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

15:37.028 --> 15:39.113
Don't worry. It's cool.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.532
You know, I got it.

15:48.831 --> 15:50.375
Much better.

16:13.356 --> 16:15.733
Come on, now, baby.

16:15.817 --> 16:17.902
My little filet.

16:17.986 --> 16:21.197
My little filet mignon with a
little fat around the edges.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.242
I like that. I like a
little fat on my steak.

16:25.243 --> 16:29.539
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.416
Alex. Alex. Alex!

16:32.417 --> 16:33.710
What? What?

16:33.793 --> 16:34.919
You suck your thumb?

16:35.753 --> 16:36.878
What is it, Melman?

16:36.879 --> 16:37.422
OK, OK.

16:37.423 --> 16:39.923
You know how I have
that bladder infection

16:39.924 --> 16:41.801
and I have to get
up every two hours?

16:41.884 --> 16:45.053
I got up to pee and I
looked over at Marty's pen,

16:45.054 --> 16:46.305
which, you know, I
usually don't do.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.224
I don't know why, but I did.
And listen...

16:48.308 --> 16:49.809
What? What's going on?

16:49.892 --> 16:51.686
It's Marty. He's gone.

16:51.769 --> 16:54.397
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.150
How long has he been
working on this?

16:57.233 --> 16:58.484
Marty!

16:58.568 --> 16:59.902
Marty!

16:59.986 --> 17:01.778
He wouldn't fit down there.

17:01.779 --> 17:03.613
Marty? Marty! Marty!

17:03.614 --> 17:06.242
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

17:08.202 --> 17:10.787
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

17:10.788 --> 17:12.705
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

17:12.707 --> 17:13.915
We gotta... we gotta...

17:13.915 --> 17:16.377
I mean, we got to call somebody!

17:20.673 --> 17:23.300
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.303
We've got a lost zebra probably
on the way to Connecticut by now,

17:26.304 --> 17:27.472
and we're gonna need...

17:29.807 --> 17:32.142
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

17:32.143 --> 17:34.646
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

17:36.648 --> 17:37.857
They'll be really mad.

17:37.940 --> 17:39.900
It'll get Marty
transferred for good.

17:39.901 --> 17:41.693
You don't bite the
hand that feeds you.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.819
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.571
- We got to go after him.
- Go after him?

17:44.572 --> 17:45.947
He's not thinking straight.

17:45.948 --> 17:48.992
We gotta stop him from making the
biggest mistake of his life.

17:48.993 --> 17:54.123
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.793
Poor little guy.

18:18.898 --> 18:19.690
Melman Come on.

18:19.691 --> 18:22.234
You know, maybe one of us should
wait here in case he comes back.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.736
Oh no. Not now. This is
an intervention Melman.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.821
We all got to go.

18:25.822 --> 18:27.991
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

18:28.074 --> 18:30.076
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

18:30.159 --> 18:33.746
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

18:33.830 --> 18:36.416
No, Park goes two ways. You
can't time the lights.

18:37.667 --> 18:41.421
I heard Tom Wolfe is
speaking at Lincoln Center.

18:43.172 --> 18:46.259
Well, of course we're going
to throw poo at him.

18:55.018 --> 18:56.352
I knew we should've taken Park.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.522
Are you sure this is the fastest
way to Grand Central Station?

18:59.647 --> 19:01.274
I don't know! That's
what Melman said.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.775
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

19:02.900 --> 19:07.029
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

19:07.030 --> 19:08.698
Free mints!

19:08.781 --> 19:10.199
This isn't a field trip Melman.

19:10.325 --> 19:13.786
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.413
Now, where's the train?

19:15.913 --> 19:17.123
Here it comes.

19:20.752 --> 19:24.129
What did Marty say to you? I
asked you to talk to him.

19:24.130 --> 19:27.717
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

19:27.800 --> 19:30.803
And I said, "What? Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

19:30.887 --> 19:34.641
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

19:40.146 --> 19:43.483
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

19:43.566 --> 19:45.233
It's on your left
after Vanderbilt.

19:45.234 --> 19:45.860
OK.

19:45.943 --> 19:49.072
If you hit the Chrysler
Building, you've gone too far.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.657
Thanks a lot, officer.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.911
Hey! Wait for the light.

19:55.995 --> 19:56.996
Freak.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.831
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.333
Right in front of me.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.919
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.588
Then I'm going to
need some backup.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.436
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.022
Did that say "Grand Central Station"
or "my aunt's constipation"?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.024
This is it.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.611
Grand Central Station.

20:29.612 --> 20:33.032
It's grand and it's central.

20:50.675 --> 20:52.467
Move aside. We have
an emergency here.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.345
This is an emergency situation.

20:54.721 --> 20:58.558
Hey, hey. Just chill out. It's
not that big of an emergency.

20:58.641 --> 21:00.059
Upstairs, downstairs.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.061
How do you like that?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.858
Lady! What is wrong with you?

21:07.483 --> 21:09.986
Ow! Get a grip on
yourselves, people.

21:10.111 --> 21:11.529
You're a bad kitty.

21:13.364 --> 21:16.242
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

21:16.367 --> 21:19.245
Looks like I'll have to
take the Stamford local.

21:19.329 --> 21:21.039
I've got him! I've got him!

21:21.164 --> 21:22.206
He's got him!

21:22.332 --> 21:24.583
He's got him! He's got him!
He's got...

21:24.584 --> 21:26.085
I got something for you!

21:29.922 --> 21:31.214
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:31.215 --> 21:33.676
Whoa! What are you
guys doing here?

21:33.760 --> 21:37.513
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

21:37.597 --> 21:40.975
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.103
You're fine? Oh, he's fine.
Oh, great.

21:44.187 --> 21:46.980
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

21:46.981 --> 21:48.608
Because I was just wondering...

21:48.691 --> 21:51.778
How could you do this to us Marty?
I thought we were your friends!

21:51.861 --> 21:54.154
What's the big deal? I was
coming back in the morning.

21:54.155 --> 21:56.282
Don't you ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

21:56.366 --> 21:59.118
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

21:59.202 --> 22:01.119
Oh, Melman, you
broke their clock?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.540
...do this again! Don't you
ever, ever do this again!

22:04.874 --> 22:06.125
Come here.

22:12.215 --> 22:15.008
We've been ratted out, boys.

22:15.009 --> 22:16.594
Hold your fire!

22:22.892 --> 22:25.645
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.901
If you have any
poo, fling it now.

22:34.237 --> 22:36.155
It's the Man.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.325
Good evening, officers.

22:39.409 --> 22:41.952
No. No. No. You don't talk now.
Okay?

22:41.953 --> 22:43.870
You're not so good with the
"putting words together

22:43.871 --> 22:47.000
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

22:47.083 --> 22:50.586
Hey! How you doing? Yeah. You know what?
Everything's cool.

22:50.670 --> 22:54.507
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.425
Actually my friend just
went a little crazy.

22:56.426 --> 22:57.593
Happens to everybody.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.680
The city gets to us all. Just
went a little cuckoo in the head.

23:00.763 --> 23:02.723
Hey! Don't be calling
me cuckoo in the head.

23:02.724 --> 23:06.685
Just shush! I will handle this.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.020
Oh! I got him!

23:08.021 --> 23:10.022
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

23:10.023 --> 23:12.191
Would you give a guy a break?

23:13.693 --> 23:15.862
We're just gonna take my
little friend here home and...

23:16.112 --> 23:18.072
forget this ever happened.
All right?

23:18.948 --> 23:20.450
No harm, no foul, right?

23:20.575 --> 23:21.366
Oh. No, no, no.

23:21.367 --> 23:25.788
Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion.
From the zoo.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.128
What's the matter with them?

23:41.804 --> 23:45.475
I feel really, really weird.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.978
I love you guys.

23:49.979 --> 23:52.815
I love you so much.

24:13.419 --> 24:16.255
Last night's dramatic
incident in Grand Central

24:16.339 --> 24:20.258
is an example of what animal rights
whackos have been shouting for years:

24:20.259 --> 24:23.346
Animals clearly don't
belong in captivity.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.931
Now they are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

24:25.932 --> 24:29.936
where they will live their lives in
the freedom they so clearly desire.

24:30.019 --> 24:33.022
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

24:33.439 --> 24:34.941
Do something!

24:35.692 --> 24:37.527
Oh, man.

24:49.372 --> 24:50.957
Oh, my head.

24:53.543 --> 24:54.877
What the...?

24:54.961 --> 24:57.380
Wait. Where? What?

24:58.214 --> 25:01.884
I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no!
Not the box.

25:01.968 --> 25:05.555
Oh, no, they can't transfer me.
Not me!

25:05.638 --> 25:08.641
Oh, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

25:08.725 --> 25:10.643
Darkness creeping in.

25:10.727 --> 25:12.979
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

25:13.062 --> 25:15.231
Walls closing in around me.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.568
So alone. So alone.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.571
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

25:21.654 --> 25:24.907
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

25:24.991 --> 25:27.827
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- This doesn't look good Marty.

25:27.910 --> 25:29.995
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

25:29.996 --> 25:33.166
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

25:33.249 --> 25:35.501
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

25:35.585 --> 25:36.669
Oh, no!

25:37.503 --> 25:40.423
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

25:40.506 --> 25:41.591
Is that Melman?

25:41.674 --> 25:44.344
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

25:44.427 --> 25:47.263
I often doze off while
I'm getting an MRI.

25:47.347 --> 25:49.681
- Melman you're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

25:49.682 --> 25:53.102
No! No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

25:53.186 --> 25:56.688
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no. No,
no, I can't be transferred.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.358
I have an appointment with
Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

25:59.359 --> 26:02.028
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

26:02.111 --> 26:04.697
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

26:04.781 --> 26:06.366
And I am not going HMO.

26:06.449 --> 26:09.202
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

26:09.285 --> 26:13.873
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

26:13.957 --> 26:16.125
Now, because of
you, we're ruined!

26:16.209 --> 26:19.712
Because of me? I fail to
see how this is my fault.

26:19.796 --> 26:23.215
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

26:23.216 --> 26:25.802
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.886
I don't know who I am,
I don't know who I am.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.596
I gotta go find
myself in the wild!

26:29.597 --> 26:30.639
- Hey hey!
- Oh please.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.850
I did not ask you to
come after me, did I?

26:33.851 --> 26:35.395
- He does have a point.
- What?

26:35.478 --> 26:38.855
I did say we should stay at
the zoo, but you guys...

26:38.856 --> 26:40.315
Melman, just shut it.

26:40.316 --> 26:42.567
You're the one that suggested this whole
idea to happen in the first place.

26:42.568 --> 26:45.071
- Alex. Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

26:45.238 --> 26:47.489
Besides, Alex, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

26:47.490 --> 26:50.827
Melman, shut it. Does
anybody feel nauseous?

26:50.910 --> 26:54.747
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

27:00.420 --> 27:01.587
Progress report.

27:01.671 --> 27:04.841
It's an older code, Skipper.
I can't make it out.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.010
You, higher mammal.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.511
Can you read?

27:08.594 --> 27:11.764
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

27:15.435 --> 27:19.104
Ship to Kenya.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.774
Wildlife preserve.

27:21.858 --> 27:22.942
Africa!

27:23.026 --> 27:26.195
Africa? That ain't going to fly.
Rico.

28:08.821 --> 28:11.490
I was the star in the
greatest city on Earth.

28:11.491 --> 28:13.993
- Guys, listen.
- A King. Loved by my people.

28:14.077 --> 28:16.746
- Let's just be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

28:16.829 --> 28:17.914
- "Loved"?
- Guys, guys.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.373
If the people loved you,

28:19.374 --> 28:22.334
it's only because they
didn't know the real you!

28:22.335 --> 28:25.338
Don't make me come up there. I'd
get to woopin'on both of you all!

28:25.421 --> 28:26.923
I thought I knew the real you!

28:27.006 --> 28:30.634
Your black-and-white stripes,
they cancel each other out.

28:30.635 --> 28:32.010
You're nothing!

28:32.011 --> 28:33.596
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

28:33.680 --> 28:35.848
You're not helping
the situation.

28:36.349 --> 28:37.683
Status.

28:37.684 --> 28:40.937
It's no good Skipper. I
don't know the codes.

28:41.020 --> 28:44.774
Don't give me excuses. Give me results!
Navigation.

28:48.111 --> 28:50.529
All right. Let me think.

28:50.530 --> 28:52.198
And shut him up!

28:55.368 --> 28:58.705
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.399
Guys?

29:27.483 --> 29:28.568
Oh, no.

29:28.735 --> 29:29.902
Gloria!

29:30.069 --> 29:31.237
Melman!

29:31.404 --> 29:32.488
Marty!

29:33.906 --> 29:35.241
Alex!

29:35.742 --> 29:36.826
Marty?!

29:37.410 --> 29:39.579
Alex!

29:39.662 --> 29:40.997
Marty!

29:41.080 --> 29:44.000
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

29:44.584 --> 29:46.085
Don't go.

30:31.881 --> 30:33.299
Marty?

30:34.384 --> 30:35.802
Melman?

30:37.136 --> 30:38.471
Gloria?

30:42.308 --> 30:43.559
Marty?!

30:43.643 --> 30:44.894
Melman?!

30:44.978 --> 30:46.479
Gloria?!

30:48.731 --> 30:49.732
Marty!

30:51.401 --> 30:53.903
Melman! Gloria!

30:55.154 --> 30:57.657
Hey, anyone! Hello!

31:01.661 --> 31:05.164
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

31:05.832 --> 31:09.335
Gloria, Melman, Marty. Marty, Gelman, Gloria.
Marty, Melman.

31:09.419 --> 31:11.921
Morty, Morty, Gelman.
Regis. Kelly.

31:12.005 --> 31:13.923
Matt, Katie, Al.

31:18.428 --> 31:21.681
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.767
Get me out of this
thing right now!

31:25.268 --> 31:27.353
Hello? Somebody?

31:27.437 --> 31:28.688
Melman!

31:28.771 --> 31:30.606
Alex? Is that you?

31:30.690 --> 31:34.694
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

31:39.699 --> 31:42.535
Melman! I got you, buddy.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.710
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

31:51.294 --> 31:54.213
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.884
- Relax.
- Alex?

31:58.885 --> 32:01.471
Giraffe, corner pocket!

32:02.388 --> 32:03.806
- Wait! Wait! Come on.
- Here goes nothing!

32:03.890 --> 32:05.975
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

32:06.059 --> 32:07.644
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

32:07.727 --> 32:09.812
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

32:09.896 --> 32:11.731
Look! Look! Look! Look!

32:11.814 --> 32:14.901
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

32:16.152 --> 32:18.321
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.489
Oh, my...

32:19.572 --> 32:20.907
Gloria!

32:30.249 --> 32:31.250
Gloria!

32:35.922 --> 32:37.924
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

32:38.007 --> 32:39.092
Gloria!

32:39.175 --> 32:40.677
Alex!

32:43.429 --> 32:45.014
- Marty?!
- Marty!

32:45.098 --> 32:49.268
Yeah! All right! That's right!

32:49.352 --> 32:53.356
Left! Left! Left. No, no, your left!
Your left! Your left!

32:54.524 --> 32:56.025
Right here's good.

32:56.776 --> 32:59.027
You know, I don't really have
anything on me right now.

32:59.028 --> 33:00.109
I'll have to get you later.

33:04.033 --> 33:05.451
To you too.

33:07.537 --> 33:09.122
Marty!

33:09.205 --> 33:10.540
Marty!

33:13.293 --> 33:14.794
Alex!

33:17.380 --> 33:19.215
Marty!

33:19.299 --> 33:20.800
Alex!

33:20.883 --> 33:22.218
Marty!

33:22.302 --> 33:23.553
Al!

33:23.636 --> 33:25.972
Marty!

33:26.055 --> 33:28.141
Alex?

33:28.224 --> 33:29.726
Marty!

33:31.728 --> 33:33.980
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

33:34.063 --> 33:35.148
- Marty!
- Hey!

33:35.231 --> 33:36.982
- Hold up! Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

33:36.983 --> 33:39.401
Come here! Don't
run away from me!

33:39.402 --> 33:39.985
Calm down! Calm down!

33:39.986 --> 33:42.989
If you keep running, I'm
going to just kill you more!

33:43.990 --> 33:45.491
Oh, look at us.

33:45.575 --> 33:48.911
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

33:48.995 --> 33:50.997
Yeah, here we are.

33:52.081 --> 33:54.917
Where exactly is "here"?

34:07.764 --> 34:09.264
San Diego.

34:09.349 --> 34:10.933
San Diego?

34:11.016 --> 34:12.518
White Sandy beaches,

34:12.601 --> 34:16.773
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

34:16.856 --> 34:19.942
I'm telling you, this could
be the San Diego Zoo.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.110
Complete with fake rocks.

34:22.195 --> 34:23.946
Wow, that looks real.

34:24.030 --> 34:28.284
San Diego? What could be
worse than San Diego?

34:28.368 --> 34:31.454
I don't know. This place
is crackalacking!

34:31.536 --> 34:34.706
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

34:34.791 --> 34:36.875
- I'm gonna kill you, Marty!
- Take it easy! Take it easy!

34:36.876 --> 34:38.127
- And then strangle you!
- Calm down.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.297
Then bury you, dig you up and clone
you, and kill all your clones..

34:41.380 --> 34:44.257
- 20-second timeout.
- And then, I'll never talk to you again.

34:44.257 --> 34:46.803
Look. We're just going
to find the people,

34:46.886 --> 34:51.391
get checked in and have
this mess straightened out.

34:52.725 --> 34:55.228
Oh, great. This is just great.
San Diego.

34:55.311 --> 34:59.232
Now I'll have to compete with
Shamu and his smug little grin.

34:59.315 --> 35:01.317
I can't top that. Can't top it.

35:01.401 --> 35:04.988
I'm ruined! I'm done. I'm
out of the business.

35:05.071 --> 35:08.241
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

35:08.324 --> 35:10.994
Come on, Alex. Do
you honestly think

35:11.077 --> 35:13.413
I intended all of
this to happen?

35:13.496 --> 35:16.416
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

35:16.499 --> 35:17.500
Okay, I'm...

35:18.751 --> 35:20.169
He just shushed me.

35:20.253 --> 35:23.339
Marty, look, you've got to be
just a little bit more und...

35:23.923 --> 35:26.049
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that?

35:26.050 --> 35:27.093
Don't you hear that?

35:30.680 --> 35:32.180
I hear it now.

35:32.181 --> 35:33.432
Where there's music,
there's people.

35:33.433 --> 35:36.269
- We go right to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

35:36.394 --> 35:37.978
Yeah, what a dump.

35:37.979 --> 35:40.314
They should call it the
San Di-Lame-O zoo!

35:40.315 --> 35:43.608
First they tell you hey! We got
this great open plan thing.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.361
Let the animals run wild!

35:45.611 --> 35:46.403
Next thing you know it...

35:46.404 --> 35:49.114
flowers in your hair, and
everybody's hugging everybody.

35:49.115 --> 35:52.619
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

36:00.376 --> 36:01.711
What the...?

36:11.596 --> 36:12.639
Oh, no!

36:19.729 --> 36:22.982
Okay, let's make a good
impression on the people.

36:23.066 --> 36:25.985
Smiles, everyone. Let's
get it together.

36:26.069 --> 36:29.572
- Is that the best you can do Melman?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

36:29.656 --> 36:31.991
Okay well great. Let's
make gas look good.

36:38.456 --> 36:42.335
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

36:42.418 --> 36:44.712
California animals. Dude.

36:44.837 --> 36:46.589
This is like a Puffy party.

37:07.276 --> 37:09.862
All girls all over the world.

37:09.988 --> 37:13.199
Original King Julien!
What a girl's man!

37:13.282 --> 37:16.743
I love all them girls I
love to move them body!

37:16.744 --> 37:18.161
When you move your body,

37:18.162 --> 37:20.999
you know, move it nice
and sweet and sassy.

37:22.125 --> 37:23.543
What kind of zoo is this?

37:23.626 --> 37:27.046
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

37:27.130 --> 37:30.133
I'm loving San Diego. This
place is off the chizain.

37:30.216 --> 37:31.301
Twenty-seven.

37:38.933 --> 37:41.144
We should've brought
chips and dip.

37:41.269 --> 37:42.478
Wait.

37:42.562 --> 37:45.105
Where's Alex? What
happened to him?

37:45.106 --> 37:46.982
He was right behind us.
Wasn't he right behind us?

37:46.983 --> 37:49.736
I don't know where he's at, but
he's missing one heck of a party.

37:49.819 --> 37:51.487
The fossa!

37:51.571 --> 37:52.989
The fossa!

37:53.072 --> 37:55.742
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

38:02.832 --> 38:05.501
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.589
I hate spiderwebs.

38:09.672 --> 38:11.591
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

38:11.674 --> 38:14.886
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

38:17.847 --> 38:21.768
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

38:21.851 --> 38:25.188
Because we've been sitting on
that beach back there for hours,

38:25.271 --> 38:27.649
and nobody's even
bothered to show up.

38:27.774 --> 38:29.024
I don't know how things are...

38:29.025 --> 38:31.193
Yeah, I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

38:31.194 --> 38:34.113
but obviously there's been some sort
of major screw up, which is cool.

38:34.197 --> 38:38.284
So if you could just point us towards the
administrative offices, we'll just uhh...

38:38.368 --> 38:39.285
Well, howdy-do.

38:46.542 --> 38:48.878
Spider! Spider!
Spider on my back!

38:48.962 --> 38:52.048
Maurice, did you see that?

38:52.173 --> 38:54.384
He scared the fossa away.

38:55.551 --> 38:57.553
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

38:58.388 --> 39:00.514
Get it! Get it! Get it!

39:00.515 --> 39:02.976
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

39:03.059 --> 39:05.395
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

39:05.478 --> 39:09.649
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

39:09.732 --> 39:14.737
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

39:14.821 --> 39:17.364
They've come to kill us.
And take our women.

39:17.365 --> 39:18.700
And our precious metals.

39:20.243 --> 39:23.997
Get up, Mort. Do not be
near the King's feet, okay?

39:25.248 --> 39:28.668
We're hiding. Be quiet, everyone.
Including me.

39:28.751 --> 39:30.420
Who's making that noise?

39:30.503 --> 39:31.671
Oh, it's me again.

39:31.796 --> 39:34.007
There it is! Get it!
Come on, Gloria!

39:34.090 --> 39:37.343
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

39:37.427 --> 39:39.887
Is it still on me?
I hate spiders.

39:40.346 --> 39:42.098
It's okay. It's gone.

39:42.223 --> 39:44.808
They are savages.

39:44.809 --> 39:46.019
Tonight we die.

39:46.144 --> 39:49.188
The feet. I told you... I told you to...
I told every...

39:49.272 --> 39:51.190
Didn't I tell him
about the feet?

39:51.858 --> 39:54.444
He did tell you about the feet.

39:55.862 --> 39:58.906
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

39:59.032 --> 40:01.367
I have devised a cunning test

40:01.451 --> 40:05.163
to see whether these
are savage killers.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.712
Hi there.

40:12.795 --> 40:17.300
You let me handle it. Alex handles it.
Marty does nothing.

40:21.596 --> 40:23.139
Hi there.

40:26.976 --> 40:29.312
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

40:29.395 --> 40:32.147
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- No, no, no. Stop. Stop.

40:32.148 --> 40:33.732
It's okay. It's okay.

40:33.733 --> 40:37.236
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

40:40.865 --> 40:43.493
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

40:43.576 --> 40:46.162
Did that big mean
lion scare you?

40:46.245 --> 40:50.667
He did? He's a big, bad
old puddy tat, isn't he?

40:50.792 --> 40:53.920
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Awww, look at you.

40:54.003 --> 40:56.255
They are so cute from a
reasonable distance.

40:56.339 --> 41:00.842
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

41:00.843 --> 41:03.804
They're just a bunch of pansies.

41:03.805 --> 41:05.181
I don't know.

41:05.264 --> 41:08.225
There's still something about
that one with the crazy hairdo

41:08.226 --> 41:10.311
that I find suspicious.

41:10.436 --> 41:11.938
Nonsense, Maurice.

41:12.021 --> 41:16.109
Come on, everybody. Let's
go and meet the pansies!

41:27.704 --> 41:31.123
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

41:31.124 --> 41:34.961
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, etc etc.
Hooray, everybody.

41:41.884 --> 41:43.386
He's got style.

41:50.226 --> 41:52.729
What is he, like, King
of the Guinea pigs?

41:54.731 --> 41:56.231
I think it's a squirrel.

41:56.232 --> 41:59.402
Welcome, giant pansies.

41:59.485 --> 42:02.238
Please feel free to
bask in my glow.

42:02.322 --> 42:04.031
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

42:04.032 --> 42:09.162
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

42:09.245 --> 42:11.331
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

42:11.414 --> 42:15.417
They're always annoying us by
trespassing, interrupting our parties,

42:15.418 --> 42:17.878
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Yes, sounds good. Look, we're just...

42:17.879 --> 42:19.504
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

42:19.505 --> 42:22.675
Oh. Wow. What big teeth you have.
Man!

42:22.759 --> 42:24.092
Shame on you, Maurice.

42:24.093 --> 42:26.679
Can you not see that you
have insulted the freak?

42:27.597 --> 42:30.099
You must tell me, who
the heck are you?

42:30.183 --> 42:33.853
I'm Alex. The Alex. And this
is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

42:33.936 --> 42:37.689
And just where are
you giants from?

42:37.690 --> 42:39.776
We're from New York and...

42:40.360 --> 42:42.528
All hail the New York giants!

42:42.612 --> 42:44.864
New York giants!

42:47.200 --> 42:49.201
What are we doing, some
sort of inbreeding program?

42:49.202 --> 42:52.622
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

42:52.705 --> 42:56.042
Excuse me. We bozos have
the people, of course.

42:56.626 --> 42:59.128
Hey, the bozos have the people.

42:59.212 --> 43:02.715
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

43:02.799 --> 43:04.258
They're up there.

43:07.971 --> 43:12.141
Don't you love the people? Not
a very lively bunch, though.

43:12.225 --> 43:13.350
Wow.

43:13.351 --> 43:16.145
So do you have any live people?

43:17.146 --> 43:18.982
No. Only dead ones.

43:19.107 --> 43:22.068
I mean, if we had a lot
of live people here,

43:22.151 --> 43:25.655
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

43:25.738 --> 43:27.073
The wild?

43:27.156 --> 43:30.243
Whoa. Hold up there a
second, fuzzbucket.

43:30.326 --> 43:31.159
You mean, like,

43:31.160 --> 43:36.331
like the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

43:36.332 --> 43:38.918
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

43:39.002 --> 43:40.753
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

43:40.837 --> 43:42.755
Oy vey!

43:42.839 --> 43:45.174
Could you excuse
me for a moment?

43:49.595 --> 43:51.888
Get me out of here! We
got to get out of here!

43:51.889 --> 43:52.932
Alex!

43:53.099 --> 43:55.768
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

43:55.852 --> 43:58.021
I'm swimming back to New York.

43:58.104 --> 44:01.065
I know my chances are
slim, but I have to try!

44:01.190 --> 44:04.776
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

44:04.777 --> 44:09.657
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off!
I can't see! I can't see!

44:11.367 --> 44:13.202
I can see!

44:14.203 --> 44:17.498
OK look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

44:17.624 --> 44:20.126
I'm sure the people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

44:20.209 --> 44:22.127
As soon as they realize
what happened,

44:22.128 --> 44:23.671
they'll come looking
for us, right?

44:24.547 --> 44:25.632
Yeah, right.

44:25.715 --> 44:29.801
I don't know the words.
But we're born free.

44:29.802 --> 44:33.389
You know something? I bet
they're already on their way.

44:39.729 --> 44:44.233
Well, boys, it's going to be
ice-cold Sushi for breakfast.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.738
Rico.

44:51.491 --> 44:55.577
Well, since I'm doomed to die
on this forsaken island,

44:55.578 --> 44:57.914
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

44:57.997 --> 45:01.334
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

45:01.417 --> 45:05.588
have divided my estate equally
among the three of you.

45:06.923 --> 45:08.091
Sorry, Alex.

45:08.174 --> 45:12.845
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

45:12.929 --> 45:14.847
No, it's not a latrine.

45:14.931 --> 45:19.185
It's a grave. You sent Melman to his grave.
Are you happy?

45:19.268 --> 45:20.602
Aw, come on.

45:20.603 --> 45:24.106
This isn't the end. This
is a whole new beginning.

45:24.107 --> 45:26.441
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to us!

45:26.442 --> 45:28.528
No. No. No. No.

45:28.611 --> 45:30.862
No. No. No. No. No. No.

45:30.863 --> 45:32.864
This is not the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

45:32.865 --> 45:35.409
Yeah. You abused the power
of the birthday wish

45:35.410 --> 45:37.286
and brought this bad
luck on all of us.

45:37.287 --> 45:39.706
Why'd you tell us your wish?
You're not supposed to do that.

45:39.789 --> 45:42.375
Wait a minute. I didn't
want to tell you. Remember?

45:42.458 --> 45:45.962
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

45:46.045 --> 45:49.716
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

45:49.799 --> 45:52.635
Look around. There's no
fences, no schedules.

45:52.719 --> 45:55.138
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

45:55.221 --> 45:57.724
Okay. Okay. I've had
enough of this.

45:57.807 --> 46:02.811
This is your side of the island, and
this is our side of the island.

46:02.812 --> 46:04.187
That is the bad side,

46:04.188 --> 46:07.065
where you can prance and skip
around like a magical pixie horse.

46:07.066 --> 46:09.610
And do whatever the hack you wanna
do all day long. And this..

46:09.694 --> 46:10.777
This is the good
side of the island,

46:10.778 --> 46:12.946
for those who love New York
and care about going home.

46:12.947 --> 46:15.992
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

46:16.075 --> 46:17.827
You know what? This isn't good.

46:17.910 --> 46:22.248
Okay! You all have your
side, and I'll have mine.

46:22.332 --> 46:25.168
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

46:25.251 --> 46:29.172
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

46:29.255 --> 46:30.672
This is the fun side,

46:30.673 --> 46:32.633
this is the fun side where
we're gonna have a great time

46:32.634 --> 46:34.092
surviving until we go home.

46:34.093 --> 46:35.636
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- I love this side.

46:35.637 --> 46:36.678
This side's the best.

46:36.679 --> 46:40.516
That side stinks! You're on the
Jersey side of this cesspool!

46:40.600 --> 46:42.852
- Wilma!
- Well. Now what do we do?

46:42.935 --> 46:45.355
Don't worry Melman. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

46:47.607 --> 46:51.611
Can't wait to see the look on
Marty's face when he sees this.

46:55.031 --> 46:58.451
Just look at him. He's
helpless without us.

47:07.961 --> 47:09.629
Shut up, Spalding.

47:14.717 --> 47:17.804
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

47:17.887 --> 47:20.556
How long do I have
to pose like this?

47:21.307 --> 47:23.726
She is finito.

47:24.560 --> 47:30.191
I defy any rescue boat within a
million miles to miss this baby.

47:30.650 --> 47:34.903
When the moment is right, we will
ignite the beacon of liberty

47:34.904 --> 47:38.658
and be rescued from
this awful nightmare!

47:38.741 --> 47:40.660
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

47:41.494 --> 47:43.203
How's the liberty
fire going, Melman?

47:43.204 --> 47:44.789
Great. Idiot.

47:44.914 --> 47:46.416
I heard that.

47:46.499 --> 47:49.085
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

47:50.420 --> 47:54.340
That's wild fire. We're not using
wild fire on Lady Liberty.

47:54.424 --> 47:57.343
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

47:57.427 --> 48:02.015
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.
I ju... I can't do it!

48:03.349 --> 48:04.434
Fire.

48:05.685 --> 48:06.686
Fire.

48:08.271 --> 48:10.356
Fire! Fire!

48:14.360 --> 48:15.528
Oh, my.

48:16.112 --> 48:17.196
Fire!

48:17.280 --> 48:19.115
Not yet! No, no! No!

48:19.198 --> 48:20.700
Fire!

48:20.783 --> 48:22.201
Melman, hold still!

48:23.119 --> 48:24.954
Jump! Alex, jump!

48:25.038 --> 48:27.290
Don't worry, cats
always land on their...

48:28.291 --> 48:31.127
Face? Man, what kind
of cat are you?

48:39.802 --> 48:41.721
You maniac!

48:42.138 --> 48:44.307
You burned it up!

48:44.807 --> 48:46.643
Darn you!

48:46.726 --> 48:49.562
Darn you all to heck!

48:49.979 --> 48:52.148
Can we go to the fun side now?

48:53.483 --> 48:56.569
Everybody, calm down. Come on.
Into your chairs.

48:56.653 --> 48:59.405
Yes. Everybody, please. Calm down.
Let go of his tail.

48:59.489 --> 49:01.990
Separate those two,
would you, please?

49:01.991 --> 49:03.033
You over here, and
you over there.

49:03.034 --> 49:04.077
Everyone... Shhh.

49:04.494 --> 49:07.330
Calm down, people, okay?

49:07.413 --> 49:11.668
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

49:11.751 --> 49:14.921
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

49:15.004 --> 49:16.589
Now, everybody,

49:16.673 --> 49:21.344
we all have great curiosity about
our guests, the New York giants.

49:21.427 --> 49:23.346
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

49:23.429 --> 49:25.472
I like them. I like them.
I liked them first.

49:25.473 --> 49:27.599
Before I even met
them I liked them.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.434
- Yes. Yes. Yes!
- I liked them right away.

49:29.435 --> 49:31.269
You hate them compared
to how much I like them.

49:31.270 --> 49:33.523
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

49:34.691 --> 49:37.944
Now, for as long as
we can remember,

49:38.027 --> 49:42.365
we have been attacked and
eaten by the dreaded fossa.

49:42.448 --> 49:45.535
The fossa! The fossa
are attacking!

49:49.038 --> 49:51.541
It's a cookbook!
It's a cookbook!

49:51.624 --> 49:53.209
Please. Maurice.

49:53.584 --> 49:56.045
Shhh. Quiet!

49:56.129 --> 50:00.300
Come on, y'all. They ain't
attacking us this very instant!

50:01.884 --> 50:05.221
So my genius plan is this:

50:05.305 --> 50:07.723
We will make the New York giants

50:07.724 --> 50:10.643
our friends and keep them close.

50:10.727 --> 50:14.062
Then, with Mr. Alex
protecting us,

50:14.063 --> 50:17.483
we will be safe and
never have to worry

50:17.567 --> 50:21.321
about the dreaded
fossa ever again.

50:23.656 --> 50:25.949
I thought of that.
I thought of that.

50:25.950 --> 50:28.785
- Yes. Me. I did.
- Hold on, everybody. Hold on.

50:28.786 --> 50:30.079
I'm just thinking now.

50:30.163 --> 50:33.415
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

50:33.416 --> 50:36.002
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

50:36.085 --> 50:39.421
I mean, maybe we
should be scared too.

50:39.422 --> 50:42.508
What if Mr. Alex is even
worse than the fossa?

50:43.926 --> 50:47.262
I'm telling you that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

50:47.263 --> 50:49.766
Maurice, you did not
raise your hand.

50:49.849 --> 50:53.603
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

50:55.271 --> 50:58.106
Does anyone else have
the heebie-jeebies?

50:58.107 --> 51:00.610
No? Good. So shut up.

51:01.110 --> 51:03.946
When the New York
giants wake up,

51:03.947 --> 51:09.619
we will make sure that
they wake up in paradise.

51:11.037 --> 51:13.289
Now, who would like a cookie?

51:37.981 --> 51:42.819
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria are
over there having a good time.

51:42.902 --> 51:45.405
There's room on the fun
side for one more.

51:45.488 --> 51:47.156
No, thanks.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.241
Look, I've been thinking.

51:49.242 --> 51:51.493
Maybe if you gave
this place a chance,

51:51.494 --> 51:54.414
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

51:54.497 --> 51:58.001
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

51:58.084 --> 52:00.003
I just want to go home.

52:01.170 --> 52:05.091
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

52:06.009 --> 52:08.928
It really isn't the
fun side without you.

52:24.777 --> 52:26.362
I know. And then...

52:29.365 --> 52:31.451
- It's him.
- Who is it?

52:31.951 --> 52:35.288
It's the pizza man. Who the
heck do you think it is?

52:35.622 --> 52:37.957
Yes? Can I help you?

52:38.708 --> 52:40.209
Can I come to the fun side?

52:42.879 --> 52:43.963
Beg your pardon?

52:44.714 --> 52:46.966
You know, I've been
kind of a jerk Marty.

52:48.885 --> 52:53.640
But I've been thinking about
what you said, and I'm sorry.

53:00.897 --> 53:04.567
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

53:04.651 --> 53:06.569
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

53:11.658 --> 53:15.745
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

53:22.669 --> 53:24.170
Very impressive.

53:24.253 --> 53:27.340
Hey, have a drink.
It's on the house.

53:29.092 --> 53:30.343
This is seawater.

53:31.427 --> 53:35.264
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

53:35.348 --> 53:37.266
Hey, y'all look hungry.

53:38.017 --> 53:41.020
How would you like some
of nature's goodness?

53:42.105 --> 53:43.773
You have food?

53:43.856 --> 53:46.776
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

53:47.527 --> 53:49.529
Seaweed on a stick.

53:50.113 --> 53:51.114
Seaweed?

53:51.531 --> 53:54.617
On a stick. Don't love
it till you try it.

54:02.458 --> 54:04.043
That's unbelievable.

54:05.461 --> 54:07.547
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

54:07.630 --> 54:10.466
It does kind of hit
the spot, doesn't it?

54:11.467 --> 54:14.721
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

54:18.725 --> 54:22.979
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

54:23.062 --> 54:24.814
Oh, but it does.

54:25.481 --> 54:27.066
Check this out.

54:32.322 --> 54:36.326
Wow. Would you look at that.

54:36.409 --> 54:40.913
It's like billions and
billions of helicopters.

54:40.997 --> 54:43.333
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

54:43.416 --> 54:46.586
Ooh! How about a
thick, juicy steak?

54:46.669 --> 54:48.171
You know what, Alex?

54:48.254 --> 54:52.925
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

54:53.009 --> 54:54.343
Thanks, Marty.

54:54.344 --> 54:57.430
It is getting late. I
guess I'm going to...

54:57.513 --> 54:59.932
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

55:00.016 --> 55:01.851
Sweet dreams, everyone.

55:32.215 --> 55:33.549
Alex.

55:43.559 --> 55:45.311
What are you doing?

55:46.145 --> 55:51.149
27, 28, 29, 30. Hmm 30. Thirty
black and only 29 white.

55:51.150 --> 55:53.568
Looks like you're black with
white stripes after all.

55:53.569 --> 55:55.154
Dilemma solved. Good night.

56:05.832 --> 56:09.418
You see, Maurice, Mr. Alex
was grooming his friend.

56:09.419 --> 56:12.921
He is clearly a
tender, loving thing.

56:12.922 --> 56:15.924
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

56:15.925 --> 56:19.595
Look at him. He's
so cute and plushy.

56:19.679 --> 56:22.264
I don't think he was
grooming him Julien.

56:22.265 --> 56:24.767
Look more like he was
tasting him to me.

56:24.851 --> 56:28.187
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

56:28.271 --> 56:32.441
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

56:32.442 --> 56:35.110
All we have to do is wait

56:35.111 --> 56:38.948
until they are deep
in their sleep.

56:44.621 --> 56:47.540
How long is this going to take?!

57:13.983 --> 57:15.401
Well, this sucks!

57:16.569 --> 57:19.322
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

57:20.490 --> 57:22.992
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.411
Rise and shining.

57:25.495 --> 57:28.665
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

57:28.748 --> 57:30.249
Wake up! Alex!

57:30.750 --> 57:32.001
You suck your thumb?

57:35.004 --> 57:37.673
- Where are we?
- What the heck is going on?

57:37.674 --> 57:39.091
- Where's the beach?
- Take it easy.

57:39.092 --> 57:40.008
What is this?

57:40.009 --> 57:43.012
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

57:43.096 --> 57:44.346
While you were asleep,

57:44.347 --> 57:48.518
we simply took you to our
little corner of heaven.

57:48.601 --> 57:50.853
Welcome to Madagascar.

57:50.937 --> 57:53.523
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

57:53.606 --> 57:55.942
No, not whooha. Ascar.

58:03.616 --> 58:05.285
Marty. It's...

58:05.368 --> 58:07.954
It's just like my mural
back at the zoo.

58:08.037 --> 58:12.207
Oh, no, fella, that is the
real deal right there.

58:12.208 --> 58:14.294
Look at that, that's
not a bad view.

58:14.377 --> 58:15.961
I mean, that's the
thing that you were...

58:15.962 --> 58:18.380
always looking at, but
it's actually there.

58:18.381 --> 58:20.090
I mean that's like the
real version of...

58:20.091 --> 58:21.801
Hey! How about once
around the park?

58:21.884 --> 58:23.176
Let's get our blood pumping,

58:23.177 --> 58:26.221
get those lungs breathing at all
this fresh air, who's with me?

58:26.222 --> 58:29.267
Ah, no. I really I don't think I can.
You're it!

58:29.392 --> 58:30.977
Hey! Want to play around?

58:33.229 --> 58:34.397
Got you there!

58:34.480 --> 58:35.898
Come here!

58:36.232 --> 58:37.400
You're it.

58:37.483 --> 58:40.236
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

58:40.820 --> 58:43.406
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

58:43.489 --> 58:45.992
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

58:46.075 --> 58:48.577
Come on, Alex, get
in the groove.

58:48.578 --> 58:50.496
I haven't eaten in two days.

58:50.580 --> 58:53.749
My blood sugar's real low. I
just don't have the energy.

58:53.750 --> 58:55.083
I don't think that's
your problem.

58:55.084 --> 58:58.421
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

58:58.504 --> 59:00.380
Let's go man. Put the
rubber to the road!

59:00.381 --> 59:02.508
You just have to let
out that inner lion.

59:02.592 --> 59:06.012
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

59:06.095 --> 59:09.265
You are, that's who. Come on!
Here we go!

59:09.349 --> 59:11.516
That's it. Now let's
build up some steam!

59:11.517 --> 59:12.726
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

59:12.727 --> 59:13.477
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

59:13.478 --> 59:14.227
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

59:14.228 --> 59:14.978
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

59:14.979 --> 59:15.729
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

59:15.730 --> 59:18.315
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

59:18.316 --> 59:20.108
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

59:20.109 --> 59:21.693
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

59:21.694 --> 59:24.014
Who's the cat? Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat?

59:24.697 --> 59:26.449
I'm the cat!

59:32.288 --> 59:33.790
Surprise!

59:41.297 --> 59:42.799
You're it. You're it!

59:42.882 --> 59:45.134
Can't juke the cat.
Cat's too quick.

59:48.137 --> 59:53.476
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

59:54.477 --> 59:57.480
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

01:00:04.654 --> 01:00:07.323
Man! I feel... different.

01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:10.743
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

01:00:12.161 --> 01:00:14.413
- Kind of charged up or something.
- Marty! Marty! Marty!

01:00:14.414 --> 01:00:17.250
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:21.754
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:26.009
I'm in heaven.

01:00:26.092 --> 01:00:26.967
You see, Maurice,

01:00:26.968 --> 01:00:30.847
Alex is now our friend and the
fossas are nowhere to be seen.

01:00:31.097 --> 01:00:33.932
It could be said that
my plan is working

01:00:33.933 --> 01:00:37.353
in a very good
working kind of way.

01:00:37.437 --> 01:00:40.523
Alex. You got to
try some of this.

01:00:42.191 --> 01:00:44.694
I feel good. I feel
like a King again.

01:00:45.528 --> 01:00:46.696
King?

01:00:47.447 --> 01:00:49.282
You should see his act.

01:00:49.365 --> 01:00:52.535
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:55.537
Oh. No, I really don't
think I could... Okay.

01:00:55.538 --> 01:00:58.874
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:01.044
The wild proudly presents:

01:01:01.127 --> 01:01:02.545
The King.

01:01:02.629 --> 01:01:05.465
Alex the lion!

01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:07.717
E flat, fellas.

01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:19.896
Yeah! The King is in the house!

01:01:19.979 --> 01:01:22.397
See, if he is the King,
then where is his crown?

01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:23.775
I've got a crown.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.069
Got a very nice one. And
it's here on my head.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.072
Look at it. Have I got it on?

01:01:35.328 --> 01:01:37.413
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:45.838
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

01:01:45.922 --> 01:01:48.174
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

01:01:49.676 --> 01:01:50.927
Break out the wave!

01:02:17.787 --> 01:02:19.956
Excuse me.

01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:22.292
You're biting my butt.

01:02:24.627 --> 01:02:27.046
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:02:28.965 --> 01:02:31.133
- Alex, what did you do?
- You just bit me on the butt!

01:02:31.134 --> 01:02:33.176
No. I didn't. Did I?

01:02:33.177 --> 01:02:35.137
- You kind of did.
- He just bit me on the butt!

01:02:35.138 --> 01:02:37.140
What the heck is wrong with you?

01:02:38.891 --> 01:02:40.143
Why'd you bite me?

01:02:40.226 --> 01:02:42.979
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

01:02:43.062 --> 01:02:45.315
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

01:02:45.398 --> 01:02:46.356
Come, come, Maurice.

01:02:46.357 --> 01:02:49.485
What is a simple bite on the
buttocks among friends?

01:02:49.986 --> 01:02:51.821
Here, give me a nibble.

01:02:51.904 --> 01:02:55.575
The party is over, Julien. Your
brilliant plan has failed.

01:02:55.658 --> 01:02:57.410
What are you talking about?

01:02:57.493 --> 01:02:59.202
Your friend here
is what we call

01:02:59.203 --> 01:03:02.415
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

01:03:02.498 --> 01:03:04.417
And he eats steak...

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.001
which is you.

01:03:06.002 --> 01:03:10.256
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.174
The plan failed.

01:03:12.175 --> 01:03:15.510
All is lost! We're all doomed.

01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:20.350
The fossas will come back and gobble
us with their mouths because...

01:03:20.433 --> 01:03:22.769
we are all steak.

01:03:22.852 --> 01:03:24.687
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

01:03:24.771 --> 01:03:27.023
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

01:03:27.106 --> 01:03:31.444
He belongs with his own kind on
the fossa side of the island.

01:03:31.527 --> 01:03:33.363
By the power vested in me,

01:03:33.446 --> 01:03:36.783
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

01:03:36.866 --> 01:03:38.033
Be gone!

01:03:38.034 --> 01:03:40.870
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

01:03:40.954 --> 01:03:42.205
Yeah!

01:03:42.288 --> 01:03:45.207
See, I told you I don't look like a...
Wait. What you say?

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:47.627
Oh, yeah!

01:03:49.128 --> 01:03:52.715
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

01:03:54.717 --> 01:03:56.386
Marty, run!

01:04:13.987 --> 01:04:16.906
A bull's eye. Excellent
shot, Maurice.

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.074
Thank you.

01:04:23.496 --> 01:04:24.747
Marty?

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:29.085
I'm so sorry, Marty.

01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:36.342
What is wrong with me?

01:04:36.426 --> 01:04:38.761
Ow.

01:04:38.845 --> 01:04:40.596
Oh, no.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.348
What have I done?

01:04:42.432 --> 01:04:45.518
It's true. I'm a monster.

01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:47.603
I got to get out of here.

01:06:59.152 --> 01:07:02.571
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

01:07:02.572 --> 01:07:04.324
And it's all my fault.

01:07:04.407 --> 01:07:07.409
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.078
Well, what are we going to do?

01:07:09.162 --> 01:07:11.831
We're gonna find a way to help him.
That's what we're gonna do.

01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:12.915
Oh, just okay.

01:07:12.999 --> 01:07:15.751
- Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?
- Yeah.

01:07:15.752 --> 01:07:18.086
- We're tough. We're gritty.
- Yeah.

01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:19.671
- We're adaptable!
- Yeah!

01:07:19.672 --> 01:07:22.842
And we are not going to lay
down like a bunch of Melmans.

01:07:22.925 --> 01:07:25.427
No, we're not.

01:07:25.428 --> 01:07:26.762
Oh. Gloria.

01:07:26.763 --> 01:07:29.932
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

01:07:30.099 --> 01:07:32.185
- The boat!
- The boat?

01:07:32.268 --> 01:07:33.900
The boat's come back for us!

01:07:33.901 --> 01:07:35.401
Come on, guys, we got
to flag it down.

01:07:38.441 --> 01:07:39.149
There it is!

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:41.443
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

01:07:41.444 --> 01:07:42.946
Over here! Yo!

01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:45.698
Melman, give me a lift. Come on.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

01:07:45.782 --> 01:07:47.200
Help! Help! Help!

01:07:47.283 --> 01:07:50.118
- Over here! Come on. Come on.
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.

01:07:50.119 --> 01:07:52.537
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- Over here! Over here!

01:07:52.538 --> 01:07:53.581
You have no idea how
much this hurts.

01:07:53.957 --> 01:07:55.792
Hey, boat! We're over here!

01:07:58.044 --> 01:08:00.629
Look! It's turning!
It's coming back!

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.047
- It's coming back!
- Yes, this way!

01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:04.550
Come on! Come on, baby!

01:08:05.718 --> 01:08:07.387
Yes! You guys.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:09.722
You guys flag down that boat.
I'll go get Alex.

01:08:09.806 --> 01:08:11.724
Whoa! Hold on there.

01:08:12.725 --> 01:08:15.143
You cannot go back
there by yourself.

01:08:15.144 --> 01:08:17.479
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

01:08:17.563 --> 01:08:20.316
When he hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it!

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.819
The people are coming.
They can help us.

01:08:22.902 --> 01:08:25.822
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

01:08:25.904 --> 01:08:28.241
Now come on, we gotta
flag down that boat.

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:49.261
Now, this is more like it.

01:08:49.345 --> 01:08:52.682
You?! Oh, ma... Where
are the people?

01:08:52.765 --> 01:08:54.684
We killed them and
ate their livers.

01:08:56.769 --> 01:08:58.104
Gotcha, didn't I?

01:08:58.187 --> 01:09:00.773
Just kiddin' doll,
the people are fine.

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:04.193
They're on a slow
lifeboat to China.

01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:06.613
Hey, I know you two.

01:09:06.696 --> 01:09:11.117
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.203
Marty? He's righ... Where did he go?
He was right behind us.

01:09:15.287 --> 01:09:18.791
He went back for Alex. He's
gonna get himself killed.

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:22.045
Well, boys, our monochromatic
friend's in danger.

01:09:22.127 --> 01:09:24.046
Looks like we have a job to do.

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:26.966
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.345
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

01:09:30.428 --> 01:09:33.221
Rico. We'll need special
tactical equipment.

01:09:33.305 --> 01:09:35.892
We're gonna face extreme peril.

01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:38.310
Private probably won't survive.

01:09:45.151 --> 01:09:47.987
Alex! Come out, Alex!

01:09:48.071 --> 01:09:50.406
The boat's here! We can go home!

01:09:56.913 --> 01:10:02.001
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:02.168 --> 01:10:06.756
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:07.423 --> 01:10:10.259
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:10.343 --> 01:10:14.097
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.515
Alex!

01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:18.518
Alex!

01:10:20.436 --> 01:10:21.938
Marty?

01:10:22.021 --> 01:10:24.564
Snap out of it, Alex.
The boat came back.

01:10:24.565 --> 01:10:25.692
We can get out of here.

01:10:25.858 --> 01:10:27.609
We can go back to civilization,

01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:29.945
and everything will be,
just like it used to be!

01:10:29.946 --> 01:10:31.447
Stay back.

01:10:32.448 --> 01:10:33.533
Please.

01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:36.619
I'm a monster.

01:10:36.703 --> 01:10:40.039
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:43.209
We're a team. You
and me, remember?

01:10:51.134 --> 01:10:53.219
I don't want to hurt you.

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:26.502
Alex.

01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:28.630
I ain't leaving without you.

01:11:44.437 --> 01:11:47.690
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:51.778
It's a wonderful song. I'm
sure you're familiar with it.

01:11:53.112 --> 01:11:56.950
<i>Start spreadin' the news.</i>

01:11:58.117 --> 01:12:01.871
<i>I'm leaving today.</i>

01:12:02.872 --> 01:12:06.542
<i>We are a great big part of it.</i>

01:12:09.295 --> 01:12:13.216
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

01:12:13.299 --> 01:12:15.969
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

01:12:16.094 --> 01:12:19.263
You really don't want to
hear me sing this by myself.

01:12:22.892 --> 01:12:26.603
Uh, Alex? Could you come
out here for a minute?

01:12:26.604 --> 01:12:30.066
Hey, Alex, a little help.

01:12:30.984 --> 01:12:32.318
Help me!

01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:35.571
Alex! Help!

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:43.788
Help me! Anybody, help me!
Somebody!

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.916
Help!

01:12:58.177 --> 01:12:59.762
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

01:13:01.347 --> 01:13:02.682
Run!

01:13:05.018 --> 01:13:06.936
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.605
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:10.940
This is the plan?

01:13:11.024 --> 01:13:12.275
Fossa halt.

01:13:14.986 --> 01:13:17.363
Fossa ooh.

01:13:18.156 --> 01:13:20.033
Fossa aaahh.

01:13:21.326 --> 01:13:23.703
Fossa ooh.

01:13:25.288 --> 01:13:27.624
Fossa aaahh.

01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:30.293
Come and get it.

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:31.377
Fossa.

01:13:44.057 --> 01:13:45.975
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:48.478
There's too many
of them, Skipper.

01:13:48.561 --> 01:13:51.648
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

01:13:57.403 --> 01:13:59.739
Alex?

01:13:59.864 --> 01:14:01.240
That's my kill.

01:14:01.324 --> 01:14:02.659
Mine.

01:14:08.414 --> 01:14:10.083
Alex hungry.

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:12.961
Alex eat.

01:14:29.852 --> 01:14:31.187
It's showtime.

01:14:33.273 --> 01:14:35.024
Thanks for not giving
up on me Marty.

01:14:36.109 --> 01:14:38.193
Man, you almost gave
me a heart attack.

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:40.028
You can't just come up
here and sneak up on me.

01:14:40.029 --> 01:14:43.032
Just because you're a lion... Let go off me.
Let go off me.

01:14:43.157 --> 01:14:46.536
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:48.705
Like I said, it's showtime.

01:14:50.123 --> 01:14:51.374
Mine.

01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:54.085
My kill.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:57.171
They're all mine.

01:14:59.257 --> 01:15:01.383
It's the King of the beasts!
Oh, no!

01:15:01.384 --> 01:15:03.553
- Please don't eat me Mr. Lion.
- He's big and scary!

01:15:03.636 --> 01:15:07.056
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:11.060
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

01:15:11.144 --> 01:15:13.646
- And, you!
- Me?

01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:22.488
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

01:15:22.905 --> 01:15:26.075
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

01:15:33.082 --> 01:15:35.835
This is my territory.
Understand?

01:15:37.003 --> 01:15:41.049
I never, ever want to see
you on my turf again.

01:15:47.805 --> 01:15:48.765
Boo.

01:15:51.684 --> 01:15:53.519
Yeah! You the cat!

01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:56.439
Got my boy back!

01:15:58.024 --> 01:15:59.359
I did it!

01:15:59.442 --> 01:16:00.609
Give me some love!

01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:03.446
The plan worked! The plan worked!
I'm very clever!

01:16:03.529 --> 01:16:06.866
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:09.160
I am very clever King.

01:16:09.869 --> 01:16:11.454
I am super genius.

01:16:11.537 --> 01:16:14.123
I am robot King of
the monkey things.

01:16:14.207 --> 01:16:17.794
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

01:16:20.129 --> 01:16:22.172
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to close my eyes?

01:16:22.173 --> 01:16:23.633
- Do it.
- Yeah. They're closed.

01:16:23.716 --> 01:16:25.551
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:25.635 --> 01:16:27.303
- No peeking.
- All right. They're closed.

01:16:27.428 --> 01:16:29.138
Rico.

01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:34.143
Hai.

01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:36.980
Open that hatch.

01:16:37.897 --> 01:16:40.441
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

01:16:41.234 --> 01:16:43.820
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

01:16:44.737 --> 01:16:46.489
- And?
- Well?

01:16:46.572 --> 01:16:48.408
Pretty good, right?

01:16:48.491 --> 01:16:50.868
There's always Plan B.

01:16:52.578 --> 01:16:54.538
This is better than steak.

01:16:54.539 --> 01:16:56.332
I love it. I love it!

01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:58.334
The kitty loves the fishy.

01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:03.506
Well, I propose a toast.

01:17:03.589 --> 01:17:06.550
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:08.678
And trust me, I know.

01:17:08.761 --> 01:17:11.514
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

01:17:11.597 --> 01:17:14.017
that his heart is bigger
than his stomach.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.893
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

01:17:23.192 --> 01:17:24.736
Enough! Stop it!

01:17:26.529 --> 01:17:29.699
Well. What do you guys think?
Should we head back to New York?

01:17:29.782 --> 01:17:32.201
I don't know Marty. I
mean, this is your dream.

01:17:32.285 --> 01:17:34.287
You sure you want to leave?

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.372
I don't care where we are.

01:17:36.456 --> 01:17:39.709
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.460
Well, in that case...

01:17:41.461 --> 01:17:44.338
Yo. Rico. I'll
take 300 orders...

01:17:44.339 --> 01:17:45.255
- To go.
- Hai.

01:17:45.256 --> 01:17:46.131
Yes, yes.

01:17:46.132 --> 01:17:49.844
But before you leave, I have
an announcement to make.

01:17:49.969 --> 01:17:52.929
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:57.601
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

01:17:57.602 --> 01:17:59.978
I have decided to thank you

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:02.814
for bringing peace to our home.

01:18:02.815 --> 01:18:04.442
And to make you feel good,

01:18:04.567 --> 01:18:07.403
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

01:18:07.487 --> 01:18:10.322
No, I couldn't. Really, I
can't take your crown.

01:18:10.323 --> 01:18:12.825
That's okay, I've
got a bigger crown.

01:18:12.909 --> 01:18:14.284
It's got a gecko on it.

01:18:14.285 --> 01:18:17.455
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

01:18:18.498 --> 01:18:21.249
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.919
- So long!
- OK. Bye-bye, now.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:24.587
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

01:18:24.671 --> 01:18:27.381
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

01:18:27.382 --> 01:18:30.468
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

01:18:31.344 --> 01:18:33.637
Faster, you naughty
little monkey.

01:18:33.638 --> 01:18:35.389
You know, by the time we
get back to New York,

01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.724
it's gonna be the
middle of the winter.

01:18:36.808 --> 01:18:39.102
So I was just
thinking, why rush?

01:18:39.185 --> 01:18:42.187
Maybe we could make a few..
Side stops along the way.

01:18:42.188 --> 01:18:44.607
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:47.150
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

01:18:47.151 --> 01:18:49.946
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:51.864
Cheap meds.

01:18:51.948 --> 01:18:54.950
You know. I wouldn't even mind coming
back here for a visit sometime.

01:18:54.951 --> 01:18:57.036
- Yeah. I could do that.
- You could say that again.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.163
Skipper?

01:19:00.164 --> 01:19:03.834
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

01:19:03.835 --> 01:19:04.961
Nah.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:08.965
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.
