WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.421
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:31.781 --> 00:33.408
We need to get a doctor here.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.077
If we don't put pressure on that wound,
she'll bleed out.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.581
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

00:43.334 --> 00:45.462
(GROANS)
That thing was squeezing my brain.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.005
(EXHALES)

00:54.679 --> 00:55.680
How bad is it?

00:57.515 --> 01:00.643
I need you to make sure
the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.479
Is that really a priority right now?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.355
Until such time as the world ends,

01:04.439 --> 01:06.357
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.446
Hill!

01:12.072 --> 01:13.198
This is a Level Seven.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.658
As of right now,

01:15.742 --> 01:16.910
we are at war.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.080
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

01:27.420 --> 01:29.255
Phase 2 isn't ready.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.175
We need a response team.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.469
THOR: Loki has an army.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.472
They will win him the Earth.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.598
He's building a portal.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.518
The major component
he still needs is a power source.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.145
High-energy density.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.107
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.900
Last night.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.194
LOKI: How desperate are you,

01:51.569 --> 01:54.447
you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?

01:55.698 --> 01:56.699
Hill!

01:56.783 --> 01:58.243
You threaten my world with war.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.371
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.042
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.630
You have made me very desperate.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.841
Agent Coulson is down.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.802
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.973
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.059
STARK: I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.062
ROGERS: Neither am I. But right now,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.565
we got to put that behind us
and get this done.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.442
FURY: That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.905
I will not order a nuclear strike
against a civilian population.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.533
We have a rogue bird.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.034
We need to shut it down!

02:40.994 --> 02:43.580
I got a nuke coming in.
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.915
And I know just where to put it.

02:48.793 --> 02:49.794
(ALL CHEERING)

02:52.297 --> 02:53.298
HILL: Those cards,

02:54.090 --> 02:57.510
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.388
They needed the push.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.558
ROGERS: You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

03:03.641 --> 03:04.809
I can't lead a mission

03:04.893 --> 03:07.729
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.938
(WHISPERS) Hail HYDRA.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.025
-This is Hill.
-I need you here in D.C.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.070
Deep shadow conditions.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.322
HILL: Give me four hours.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.448
FURY: You have three.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.617
-(GUNSHOTS)
-(FURY GROANS)

03:21.034 --> 03:22.368
(EKG BEEPING)

03:22.827 --> 03:24.162
Don't do this to me, Nick.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.873
DOCTOR: Three, two, one. Clear.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.083
(EKG FLATLINING)

03:29.167 --> 03:31.419
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.131
I need to take him.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.012
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.891
As difficult as this is to accept,

03:45.016 --> 03:47.352
Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.692
HILL: GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.860
DOCTOR: Let me take her.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.195
She'll want to see him first.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.824
About damn time.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.120
ROGERS: HYDRA grew and nobody noticed.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.998
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, it all goes.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.083
HILL: He's right.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.670
ROMANOFF: We have to stop the launch.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.589
We need to replace their
targeting blades with our own.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.467
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

04:19.550 --> 04:21.469
they'll triangulate
with Insight satellites,

04:21.552 --> 04:23.429
becoming fully weaponized.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.306
They're initiating launch.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.809
If even one of those
ships remains operational,

04:28.309 --> 04:29.811
a lot of people are gonna die.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.355
Falcon, where are you now?

04:32.438 --> 04:33.439
I'm in.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.734
Two down, one to go.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.114
One minute.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.032
TECH: Target saturation reached.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.076
Fire when ready.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.620
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.372
ROGERS: Fire now.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.165
-But, Steve...
-Do it!

04:52.250 --> 04:53.584
The price of freedom is high.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.378
It always has been.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.761
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.766
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.269
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

05:12.812 --> 05:13.896
Incoming!

05:23.239 --> 05:24.949
Where are the ladies, gentleman?

05:26.868 --> 05:27.869
They must be busy...

05:27.952 --> 05:30.621
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.415
Testosterone.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.126
(YELLING)

05:36.336 --> 05:37.879
ULTRON: I'm a peacekeeping program...

05:37.962 --> 05:40.131
created to help the Avengers.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.758
You're all killers.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.718
BANNER: Ultron.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.476
HILL: The news is loving you guys.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.728
Nobody else is.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.107
Until we can find Ultron,
I'd stay in stealth mode.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.742
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.328
PIETRO: This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.914
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.003
HILL: Sir, how does it work now?

06:21.130 --> 06:24.217
If we get into a situation like
this again, what happens then?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.386
Nick.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.971
FURY: Hill.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.517
They'll come back.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.728
HILL: You really sure about that?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.564
FURY: I am.

06:40.691 --> 06:41.692
HILL: Why?

06:43.444 --> 06:45.029
FURY: Because we'll need them to.
