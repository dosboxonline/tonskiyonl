17:05.274 --> 17:06.525
That's what Mamma says?

17:07.151 --> 17:08.152
Yes.

Yes. [chuckles]

[Aviram] Can you wait in the carr?

17:30.549 --> 17:32.176
I don't want to be alone.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.219
[Aviram] Just stay here...

17:34.762 --> 17:36.722
I'm going to get you an ice cream.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.599
[camera clicking]

19:17.865 --> 19:19.700
[al-Masih, in Arabic] For centuries,

19:21.410 --> 19:24.580
these steps have been stained
with the blood of brother for brother.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.582
And none of it pleased God.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.041
How could it?

19:28.876 --> 19:33.338
This soil we stand on
is supposed to represent unity.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.009
It can no longer divide men.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.344
That day has passed.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.055
History has ended.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.101
The scriptures say that on judgment day,

19:46.185 --> 19:51.064
a set of scales
will be hung from these arches,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.526
to weigh all souls.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.823
What if I told you that day is here?

19:59.907 --> 20:03.535
A day where there is no more
bargaining with God

20:04.453 --> 20:07.456
"when no soul will suffice
for another soul."

20:07.539 --> 20:10.876
Just you and your God...

20:11.960 --> 20:13.253
and your deeds.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.338
All of them.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.010
Who of you has done
what God has truly asked?

20:20.636 --> 20:22.638
Who of you could step forward...

20:22.721 --> 20:24.014
and weigh his soul?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.268
Step forward...

20:29.645 --> 20:31.355

20:40.155 --> 20:41.323

Looking for the people that live here.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.883
It's the middle of the night.
Don't you have any decency?

33:30.967 --> 33:33.636
You cut off our electricity!
You send in soldiers!

33:33.720 --> 33:35.263
We're not Israelis!

33:35.346 --> 33:37.140
We're reporters.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.934
Is this where the little boy
from al-Aqsa lives?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.061
-He's gone.
-When did he leave?

33:42.145 --> 33:44.564
-Today. He's not coming back.
-Where did they go?

33:45.106 --> 33:47.066
Why have you come
in the middle of the night?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.526
Listen.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.654
We don't want any trouble.
We just want to talk.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.741
They are finished talking.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.409
That's why they left.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.744
[Eva] What do you mean?

33:57.827 --> 33:58.745
Listen.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.790
The boy has been touched by God.

34:03.082 --> 34:05.960
[in English] You understand?
He is blessed from God.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.964
[in Arabic] Today this street was filled
with people who wanted to touch him.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.468
They are safer where they are.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.178
Who took them?

34:15.261 --> 34:16.596
[in English] Listen. Uh...

34:16.888 --> 34:20.266
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe for people like you, okay?

34:20.349 --> 34:21.934
[Eva, in Arabic] Who took them?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.478
[in English] Just... just go.

34:32.195 --> 34:36.199

34:40.745 --> 34:43.539

34:43.623 --> 34:45.917

34:46.000 --> 34:49.378
<i>Adding to that pressure today</i>

34:49.462 --> 34:51.798

34:51.881 --> 34:55.134

34:55.218 --> 34:57.970

[Eva] <i>Why haven't I heard of him?</i>

37:00.927 --> 37:03.804
[Q] He does the kind of stuff
you're not supposed to hear about.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.478
[sighs]

37:10.978 --> 37:12.647
Remember the Hebron Nine?

37:14.106 --> 37:15.107
That was him.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.361
He gets a long leash
'cause he gets results.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.367
It still doesn't make sense
why he'd release his own prisoner.

Jordan.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.350
We've lost him.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.481
[woman, in Arabic] Here!

37:57.775 --> 37:58.859
Come closer.

37:58.943 --> 37:59.986
Huh?

38:00.695 --> 38:01.821
Are you hungry?

38:04.573 --> 38:05.866
[Jibril] Uh--

38:05.950 --> 38:07.159
Do you want some bread?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.044
We have more...

38:17.461 --> 38:18.462
much more.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.506
Thank you.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.051
We're going to get you all out.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.594
Hm?

38:26.637 --> 38:27.805
Go!

38:29.390 --> 38:31.142
-Tell the elders!
-[grunts]

38:33.519 --> 38:34.645
Hurry!

Hurry!
