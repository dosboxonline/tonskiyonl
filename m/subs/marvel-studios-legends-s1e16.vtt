00:03.086 --> 00:05.088
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.945 --> 00:30.989
Two weeks ago,
you were parking cars for tips,

00:31.072 --> 00:33.408
and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world

00:33.491 --> 00:35.076
from soul-sucking monsters?

00:35.660 --> 00:38.246
I know, you're trying to get me back
for what I said last time,

00:38.329 --> 00:39.873
-but I'm not gonna apologize...
-(CRACKLING)

00:39.956 --> 00:41.499
...for speaking the truth as a friend.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.918
In fact, I actually think
this whole bit you're doing

00:44.002 --> 00:45.253
just further proves my point.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.379
You guys are obviously...

00:46.463 --> 00:47.464
(CRACKLING CONTINUES)

00:47.547 --> 00:49.257
-What?
-WONG: Shang-Chi.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.178
Shang-Chi.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.765
Uh... Here. Present.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.727
(CHAIRS SCRAPE)

01:00.810 --> 01:01.936
My name is Wong.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.774
Yeah. I know, sir. I'm a huge fan...

01:05.857 --> 01:06.983
Do you have the rings?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.944
SHANG-CHI: Uh... Yeah, yes.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.947
Good. Let's go,
we have a lot to talk about.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.908
You too.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.998
WONG: <i>While heroes like the Avengers</i>
<i>protect the world from physical dangers,</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:25.710
<i>we sorcerers safeguard it</i>
<i>against more mystical threats.</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:29.631
That's <i>The Book of Cagliostro.</i>
A study of time.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.301
Oh, my.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.514
WONG: One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.601
Kaecilius. Just after he strung up
the former librarian

01:42.060 --> 01:43.603
<i>and relieved him of his head.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:48.650
I am now the guardian of these books.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.362
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again,

01:52.904 --> 01:53.947
I'd know it,

01:54.447 --> 01:57.408
and you'd be dead
before you ever left the compound.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.558
WONG: Stop!

02:25.562 --> 02:28.022
I was just doing exactly what it said
in the book.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.859
What did the book say about
the dangers of performing that ritual?

02:30.942 --> 02:32.944
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.613
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.825
We do not tamper with natural law.
We defend it.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.288
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power

02:43.371 --> 02:44.831
where great cities now stand.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.458
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.336
That door to the New York Sanctum.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.174
That one to the London Sanctum.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.550
Together,

02:55.842 --> 02:59.304
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

02:59.888 --> 03:04.976
The Sanctums protect the world
and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.603
From what?

03:10.565 --> 03:11.983
Choose your weapon wisely.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.277
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.654
No one.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.202
(SIREN BLARING)

03:22.285 --> 03:23.745
The Sanctum's already fallen.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.628
-Wong.
-(GRUNTS)

03:39.969 --> 03:41.721
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.141
Well, don't stop now.

03:50.688 --> 03:51.981
WONG: Wise choice.

03:52.857 --> 03:56.569
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto,
once you've mastered its powers.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.571
Until then,

03:59.447 --> 04:02.408
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.493
A what?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.456
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,
but you still have much to learn.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.667
At the dawn of the universe,

04:10.750 --> 04:13.836
the Big Bang sent six elemental crystals

04:13.920 --> 04:16.256
hurtling across the virgin universe.

04:18.049 --> 04:22.178
These Infinity Stones each control
an essential aspect of existence.

04:24.639 --> 04:29.352
Be thankful that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

04:29.435 --> 04:31.896
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.774
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.443
-I have him.
-Damn it.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.696
(ROARS)

04:44.617 --> 04:48.204
THANOS: What I'm about to do
to your annoying little planet,

04:49.414 --> 04:50.456
I'm gonna enjoy it.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.668
We must be ready.

04:53.751 --> 04:54.752
DR. STRANGE: <i>We'll be ready.</i>

05:00.049 --> 05:01.050
Is that everyone?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.802
What? You wanted more?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.014
(YELLING)

05:20.278 --> 05:21.279
(WONG LAUGHING)

05:25.658 --> 05:27.076
Oh, that's funny.
