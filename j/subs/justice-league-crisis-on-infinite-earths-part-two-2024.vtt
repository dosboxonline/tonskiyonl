Damn that bastard.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.320
Jim...

02:34.404 --> 02:36.239
You were a diversion.

03:25.414 --> 03:29.167
Ooh, | know what you're thinking, Batsy.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.711
What a waste.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.838
Uh, 'fraid not.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.507
Evidently, there's plenty more

This is Killer Crock. Have you met him?

So many Earths.

Don't make me come over there.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.060
-[both growling]
-[Batman] Shoot that tower, Joker,

05:10.143 --> 05:12.062
and the whole planet dies.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.774
You see, that's what everybody says.

05:15.857 --> 05:19.569
But how am | supposed to know
that's true unless | pull the trigger?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.987

-[rope whirring]
-1 told you to stay out of this.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.922

[The Joker grunts]

06:41.067 --> 06:42.694
We're not killers.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.779
You trained us well.
We know what we're doing.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.283
| didn't train you.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.910
-[grunting]
-[thuds]

06:51.202 --> 06:52.495
-You needed help.
-[The Joker groaning]

06:52.579 --> 06:55.206
When the Justice Society was assigned
to search for The Flash--

06:55.290 --> 06:57.000
I'm the one
who gave them the assignment.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.044
A wild goose chase.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.338
The Flash is dead.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.466
He's missing.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.385
There were no witnesses. No body.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.180
The last thing | needed
were a bunch of dilettantes

07:10.263 --> 07:12.098
and senior citizens getting in my way.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.019
This isn't even your Earth.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.564
It's the Earth whose tower
is in the middle of Gotham.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.942
That makes it my world.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.110
And | work alone.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.364
Who died and made you king?

07:29.908 --> 07:31.493
Everyone on Earth-3.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.745
[cackling]

07:45.632 --> 07:47.968
[Psycho Pirate]
Well, this is getting awkward.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.680
I've seen my share of doctors in my day,

07:51.763 --> 07:55.141
but I've never had one
give me the silent treatment.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.228
Perhaps this is a new technique,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.939
a subtle attempt to draw me out.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.277
Get me talking. Is that the idea?

08:07.737 --> 08:08.655
Fine.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.700
| know all about this process.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.202
Psychoanalysis.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.878
It all started 25 years ago
in the English countryside.

08:24.587 --> 08:28.258
| was a perfectly ordinary boy
named Charles Halstead.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.219
Well, nearly ordinary.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.472
| was very solitary. Loved books.

08:35.557 --> 08:40.437
Treasure Island, Blackbeard.
"Avast ye, matey," that sort of thing.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.065
-Hated other children.
-[Charles play-fighting]

08:44.149 --> 08:47.027
[Psycho Pirate]
Gave me a thumping headache.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.696
-Honestly, adults, too.
-[man] Take him inside!

08:49.779 --> 08:52.032
-[Psycho Pirate] I'm not a mind reader.
-[man yelling]

08:52.115 --> 08:54.617
[Psycho Pirate]
More like an emotion reader.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.036
A hyper empath.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.581
-1 feel what you're feeling.
-[yelling indistinctly]

09:00.707 --> 09:01.791
-[Psycho Pirate] It's horrible.
-[woman arguing]

09:01.875 --> 09:06.880
[Psycho Pirate] The more people,
the more emotions, more pain.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.506
-[Charles groans]
-[Psycho Pirate] My mind seemed

09:08.590 --> 09:11.718
to amplify whatever emotions came my way

09:11.801 --> 09:13.636
-before sending them back out.
-[woman grunts]

09:14.304 --> 09:16.765
[Psycho Pirate] A kind of feedback loop
would emerge.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.016
[grunts]

09:18.099 --> 09:20.810
[Psycho Pirate] My parents harbored
no more hatred for one another

09:20.894 --> 09:22.520
-than any other married couple.
-[both arguing loudly]

09:22.604 --> 09:23.521
[Charles groaning]

09:23.605 --> 09:25.857
[Psycho Pirate]
Until I drew it out of them.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.610
-[Charles groaning]
-[Psycho Pirate] I'm sure most children

09:28.693 --> 09:31.821
seeing their parents
trying to murder one another

09:31.905 --> 09:34.365
would have felt just the way I did.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.494
Like it was the end of the world.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.870
[rumbling]

10:04.312 --> 10:05.897
[shield buzzing]

10:05.980 --> 10:06.815
[thudding]

10:09.317 --> 10:10.401
[Monitor] Satellite.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.822
[Satellite] A small piece of debris
from Krypton, Monitor.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.159
It is so small | hardly noticed it.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.995
There is no damage to the shield.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.375
[woman grunts]

10:26.417 --> 10:28.670
[panting]

10:32.173 --> 10:34.467
-Debris?
-Debris, apparently containing

10:34.551 --> 10:37.762
an adolescent Kryptonian female,
presently suffocating.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.432
-[Supergirl panting]
-[electronic beeping]

10:45.353 --> 10:46.271
[grunts]

10:47.772 --> 10:49.524
[groaning]

10:50.650 --> 10:53.695
Satellite, | find
the death of this creature...

10:54.445 --> 10:55.530
distracting.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.951
[Satellite] Ten billion Kryptonians
are dead or soon will be.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.954
You have witnessed untold
galactic extinctions.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.331
Why does this disturb you, Monitor?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.209
| prefer my task
of chronicling all phenomena

11:09.085 --> 11:10.211
from a distance.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.755
Please remove it.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.510
[energy warbling]

11:26.227 --> 11:27.687
[electronic beeping]

11:35.028 --> 11:36.321
What have you done?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.199
-[loud crash]
-[breathing heavily]

11:39.282 --> 11:40.867
[Satellite] Bringing it aboard
was the only way

11:40.950 --> 11:42.952
to ensure it wouldn't block your view.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.454
-[Supergirl sighs in relief]
-[Satellite] Rest assured,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.165
she will soon expire
from her radiation exposure.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.959
It cannot die on the Satellite.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.297
That would be intolerable.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.716
You know what must be done.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.726
[Psycho Pirate] My parents didn't
quite manage to kill one another,

12:06.809 --> 12:09.270
but they'd had enough of me.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.523
Their solution was typically British.

12:12.607 --> 12:13.650
Boarding school,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.777
in Bavaria, no less.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.820
No sense taking any chances.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.530
-[Charles grunting]
-[boys laughing]

12:22.116 --> 12:23.743
[Psycho Pirate] As you can imagine,

12:23.826 --> 12:28.122
the effortless viciousness
of 100 adolescent boys

12:28.206 --> 12:30.541
-greatly acerbated my condition.
-[Charles grunts]

12:31.209 --> 12:34.212
[Psycho Pirate]
Things were often strained.

12:35.672 --> 12:39.717
<i>My classmates took notice of me
to such a degree</i>

12:39.801 --> 12:41.302
that they gave me a nickname,

12:42.011 --> 12:43.846
perhaps because | wouldn't give them

12:43.930 --> 12:47.308
the satisfaction of hearing me scream.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.351
-[boys laughing]
-[Charles grunting]

12:50.270 --> 12:52.313
-[Charles breathing heavily]
-[boys chuckling]

12:54.023 --> 12:56.067
[groaning softly]

13:25.221 --> 13:26.597
[Satellite] You must eat something.

13:26.681 --> 13:31.144
This nutrient is an exact replica
of a popular dish on your home world.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.190
[Monitor] What's wrong with it?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.776
[Satellite] On top of
the radiation poisoning

13:38.860 --> 13:40.320
and near-death experience,

13:40.403 --> 13:42.905
she has witnessed the annihilation
of her species,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.033
and lost everyone she has ever known.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.412
She also has a cranial contusion
from her impact with the pod door.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.001
Perhaps if you ate with her,
it would stir a sense memory.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.588
Or, if you prefer, we could just
eject her out an airlock.

14:16.147 --> 14:21.069
| have not absorbed energy
in this manner in 100 million years.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.405
[Satellite] Would you
like a napkin, sir?

14:27.742 --> 14:28.576
[spoon clinks]

14:29.869 --> 14:31.120
[slurps]

14:35.333 --> 14:36.667
[continues slurping]

14:48.388 --> 14:49.889
-[boy yells]
-[Charles groans]

14:51.849 --> 14:53.309
[all laughing]

14:54.685 --> 14:57.397
[Psycho Pirate] The inexorable abuse

14:57.480 --> 15:01.192
-did procure an unintended boon for me.
-[Charles groaning]

15:01.275 --> 15:03.486
<i>Psycho Pirate)
| began learning how to...</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:05.988
-control my power.
-[boys laughing]

15:06.072 --> 15:08.866
[Psycho Pirate] Needs must
when the devil drives.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.621
| discovered most human action
is dictated by emotion.

15:14.414 --> 15:20.086
Not reason, not altruism,
not even self-preservation.

15:20.169 --> 15:25.716
A vain, transitory feeling
overrides them all.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.676
[grunts]

15:30.054 --> 15:34.225
Little by little,
| took over the entire school,

15:34.308 --> 15:36.227
bending it to my whims.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.647
| learned the painful cacophony

15:39.730 --> 15:44.444
of so many people’s conflicting emotions
can be alleviated

15:45.069 --> 15:49.115
by everyone feeling the same emotion.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.117
-[clothes rustling]
-[gasps]

15:51.200 --> 15:52.410
[all laughing]

15:59.667 --> 16:01.210
[stick whipping]

16:14.974 --> 16:16.142
[Supergirl] Where am 1?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.480
[Monitor] You are on
a Monitor Satellite,

16:21.522 --> 16:23.107
a quasi-sentient craft

16:23.191 --> 16:24.567
-existing outside...
-[gasps]

16:24.650 --> 16:25.776
[Monitor] ...normal timespace,

16:25.860 --> 16:30.823
designed to facilitate observation
and documentation of celestial events.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.211
[Supergirl] What are you?

16:43.294 --> 16:46.214
| am the Monitor assigned to this craft.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.388
[Supergirl] Who am I?

16:59.435 --> 17:03.564
You're Kara Zor-El
of the planet Krypton.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.818
-That's my home?
-[Monitor] Yes.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.737
Can | go home now?

17:12.615 --> 17:14.282
Not right now, Kara.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.703
| need your help here on the Satellite.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.915
But can | go home later?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.171
Perhaps, child...

17:28.172 --> 17:30.299
when our job here is finished.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.971
[engines warbling]

17:36.138 --> 17:37.306
[Supergirl] Who are you?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.016
[Monitor] am Mar Novu.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.935
-[electronic beeping]
-[Monitor] / am a Monitor...

17:42.311 --> 17:44.939
a race of beings
ancient beyond your comprehension.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.277
We observe and record
all events in this universe

17:49.360 --> 17:50.736
and those surrounding it.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.616
We bear witness but are forsworn
never to interfere.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.077
[Supergirl] Why?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.079
[Monitor] Because...

18:01.247 --> 18:02.164
[gasps]

18:08.796 --> 18:10.298
We are Monitors.

18:15.011 --> 18:19.557
Isn't my desire the timeless
humanitarian dream, Doctor?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.310
Unity and equality.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.855
All people feel what | feel,
all the time.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.565
Paradise.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.527
Well, by that time,
the Third Reich had risen to power,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.738
even in our tiny village.

18:33.821 --> 18:37.575
So, when no word had come
from the school for some time,

18:37.658 --> 18:40.244
the police were sent to investigate.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.712
They were not adequately prepared.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.966
[ominous music playing]

18:55.676 --> 18:57.386
[soft creaking]

19:25.289 --> 19:27.833
[Supergirl] Monitor, are you in here?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.293
[whooshing]

19:31.128 --> 19:32.588
[Satellite] He is not here, Kara.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.923
And neither should you be.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.842
What is this place, Satellite?

19:36.926 --> 19:40.346
The hangar deck. There is
really nothing in here to interest you.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.141
I'm sure it is time
to continue your lessons, Kara.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.561
Your understanding of the structure
of the Multiverse is quite lacking.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.525
...I know this object.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.029
[Satellite] Kara, please come away.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.865
And it seems to know me.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.576
This brought me here.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.455
From... Krypton.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.873
-[electrical pulsing]
-[gasps]

20:13.254 --> 20:15.005
Oh, it's beautiful.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.009
| remember my mother, my father.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.137
| wanna go there. Now.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.763
Take me back to Krypton.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.058
[automated voice] Unable to comply.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.728
Krypton is no longer
a viable destination.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.528
[Psycho Pirate] / like Nazis.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.698
They're already so brainwashed,

20:40.781 --> 20:43.242
it's child's play for me
to control them.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.786
| barely had to.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.913
Hate and fear are easy.

20:48.706 --> 20:55.087
But affection, admiration,
those are more difficult.

20:55.171 --> 21:00.092
I must say it took some effort
to manipulate the Kriegsmarine

21:00.176 --> 21:03.971
to offer me a commission as captain
of a merchant raider.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.057
These were German ships,

21:07.141 --> 21:11.437
disguised to look like freighters
and fly neutral colors.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.482
We'd signal "Mayday" to Allied ships,

21:14.565 --> 21:17.651
and when their would-be
rescuers got close enough...

21:19.612 --> 21:20.821
[speaking German]

21:23.949 --> 21:25.743
[Psycho Pirate in singsong] Surprise.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.290
[in normal voice]
We'd blow them to pieces,

21:31.373 --> 21:33.501
or if they surrendered,

21:33.584 --> 21:35.836
we'd relieve them of their cargo,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.047
then blow them to pieces.

21:45.095 --> 21:49.058
I'd amuse my crew
by having the enemy cheer happily for us

21:49.141 --> 21:51.769
as they sunk into the Atlantic.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.895
[man 1] Long live the Third Reich.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.230
[man 2] Victory to Germany.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.235
[Psycho Pirate] At last,
| was the pirate

21:59.318 --> 22:02.112
I'd always wanted to be as a child.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.823
[thunder rumbling]

22:04.532 --> 22:06.075

[Psycho Pirate] /It was the end.
Nothing could save me.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.639
Frankly, | was enjoying the silence,

23:10.723 --> 23:14.435
but | reached out with my mind
one last time.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.896
-[energy warbling]
-Just in case.

23:21.442 --> 23:22.276
[water splashing]

23:29.658 --> 23:31.452
[water bubbling]

23:40.669 --> 23:44.089
[Psycho Pirate] That was one
of the few times in my life

23:44.173 --> 23:46.467
when | was actually surprised.

23:53.724 --> 23:58.520
Honestly, it was much harder with him
than the others.

23:58.604 --> 24:03.359
The Sea King's mental defenses
are stronger than you'd think,

24:03.442 --> 24:05.152
for a man with gills.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.496
[grunts]

-[Psycho Pirate] But inevitably...

24:46.902 --> 24:48.153
well...

24:48.946 --> 24:51.448
everyone is a disappointment.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.617
-[grunting]
-[energy warbling]

24:58.205 --> 25:00.249
You are late for nutrition,

25:00.332 --> 25:03.794
and you completely forgot
your Chronal Displacement Physics class.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.089
You must learn self-discipline
if you are to--

25:07.172 --> 25:08.841
-[yells] You lied!
-[objects clatter]

25:08.924 --> 25:10.300
| remember everything.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.595
You could have stopped it,
or at least saved millions,

25:13.679 --> 25:15.222
but you did nothing!

25:16.348 --> 25:19.601
Non-interference has been
sacrosanct to my race

25:19.685 --> 25:21.937
since before your sun existed.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.398
You said you'd bring me home.

25:25.232 --> 25:28.277
| have no home. You just kept me here
like a zoo specimen.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.947
We made a home for you.

25:33.907 --> 25:34.867
A cage!

25:34.950 --> 25:37.286
"Come see the last living Kryptonian."

25:38.203 --> 25:39.329
[sobbing]

25:40.456 --> 25:44.376
You are not
the last Kryptonian in this reality.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.795
There is another...

25:49.339 --> 25:51.717
on this world of savage primitives.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.676
[electronic beeping]

25:52.760 --> 25:55.429
They are like you, only superficially.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.807
| don't know how your kinsman bears it.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
Kinsman?

26:00.893 --> 26:01.977
[electronic whirring]

26:02.853 --> 26:05.022
Kal-El is your cousin.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.736
Kal-El is alive?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.863
And you kept me here for...

26:13.781 --> 26:16.784
| don't even know!
How long have | been a prisoner here?

26:18.452 --> 26:21.622
The Satellite exists
in many universes simultaneously.

26:22.456 --> 26:25.250
Time, as you know it,
has no meaning here,

26:25.334 --> 26:27.127
and you are not a prisoner.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.255
I'm through waiting and watching

26:30.339 --> 26:31.381
and doing nothing.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.260
I'm the opposite of you,
and I'm going to do something.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.722
It is forbidden to interfere.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.227
Just watch me.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.037
[Psycho Pirate] From there,
it was a simple thing

27:02.121 --> 27:06.333
to create an alliance
between Atlantis and the Third Reich.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.461
But | must be boring you
to tears, Doctor.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.046
Forgive me.

27:11.130 --> 27:15.259
After all, it was you
who invited me here.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.512
You have something for me.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.307
That's what they tell me,
at any rate. So, please...

27:23.475 --> 27:24.476
speak up.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.313
Not in the mood to talk?

27:28.397 --> 27:30.774
-Well, you soon will be.
-[energy warbling]

27:34.570 --> 27:35.946

27:37.906 --> 27:42.411
Clearly your mind is too far gone
for me to reach you.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.496
There's nothing left.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.165
[Doctor Fate] Did you say something?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.168
Oh, it's you.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.713
Sorry. | was worlds away.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.675
-[energy warbling]
-That won't work.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.179
There are too many of me.

28:00.262 --> 28:01.847
Here, there,

28:01.930 --> 28:05.434
and, oh, so many other realities.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.187
Simultaneously.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.023
People think I'm mad.

28:11.106 --> 28:15.360
In reality, | show extraordinary focus.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.453
[chanting in Latin]

28:34.671 --> 28:35.589
[grunts]

28:36.715 --> 28:41.303
[Doctor Fate in English] Is that any way
for the mighty Psycho Pirate to behave?

28:41.386 --> 28:45.724
Especially since
I'm about to give you a gift,

28:46.683 --> 28:50.312
the ability to travel between realities.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.940
-[energy warbling]
-Come closer.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.451
[Psycho Pirate groans]

[dramatic music playing]

29:19.633 --> 29:21.343
[breathing heavily] Stay back.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.888
| don't want it. | don't want it.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.432
[Doctor Fate] You shall have it
all the same.

29:27.516 --> 29:28.600
[Psycho Pirate groaning]

29:28.684 --> 29:32.145
You have a role to play
in the Crisis to come.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.190
[screaming]

29:38.193 --> 29:39.736
[whimpering]

29:41.405 --> 29:42.948
[fire crackling]

29:47.494 --> 29:50.038
Guard. Guard!

29:50.122 --> 29:51.373
Open this door!

29:51.456 --> 29:53.375
Get me out of here now!

29:55.585 --> 29:57.087
[electronic beeping]

29:58.630 --> 30:00.549
[Monitor] Another universe lost.

30:03.051 --> 30:06.430
The Antimatter wave shows no sign
of weakening or slowing.

30:07.723 --> 30:11.310
In fact, as it jumps between realities,
its power increases by...

30:12.811 --> 30:13.937
Satellite.

30:14.021 --> 30:17.149
Is the destruction
of all universes boring you?

30:18.108 --> 30:19.651
Checking in on Kara again?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.529
[Satellite] She is
a remarkable being, Monitor.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.239
And we are tasked to observe.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.161
All significant events, Satellite.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.164
[Satellite] This is significant.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.459
She fights against Brainiac's attempt
to remake this universe.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.919
[Monitor] Brainiac possesses
the Miracle Machine

30:38.503 --> 30:40.047
and employs the Dark Circle.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.632
Her task is hopeless.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.970
[Satellite] And yet she fights on,
despite the impossible odds.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.264
Yes.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.768
Yes, she does.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.771
It is almost...

30:57.314 --> 30:58.398
admirable.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.073
[Satellite] It seems
Kara has beaten the odds.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.637
Kal-ElI?

31:33.141 --> 31:34.810
[birds singing]

31:37.813 --> 31:38.814
[Satellite] Kara.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.609
-Satellite? What are you--
-[Satellite] I'm sorry, Kara.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.790
[Supergirl] You!

32:02.129 --> 32:04.589
[Monitor] Kara, this display
is beneath you.

32:05.298 --> 32:09.052
You know Monitor shields
are impervious to any attack.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.640
Then I'll just have to tear
the ship apart with my bare hands.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.517
[Satellite] Please don't.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.271
| almost convinced myself
this was all a bad dream.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.272
But here you are,

32:20.355 --> 32:22.941
snatching me away from my new world
right in the middle of...

32:23.692 --> 32:26.236
You returned
to this world's 21st century

32:26.319 --> 32:29.114
to search for your missing
loved one, Kal-El,

32:29.197 --> 32:31.575
and the human known as Batman.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.288
What do you know about this?
Did you abduct them too?

32:36.371 --> 32:38.039
[Satellite] We have taken no one,

32:38.123 --> 32:40.167
but Monitor knows where they are.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.377
Kara, your friends

32:42.461 --> 32:47.632
and all life-forms are in mortal peril
beyond imagining.

32:49.134 --> 32:53.847
But perhaps there is something
we can do.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.060
[electronic beeping]

33:01.104 --> 33:04.441
And your people, the Monitors,
they can't stop it?

33:04.524 --> 33:05.650
They will not.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.611
They simply watch...

33:09.070 --> 33:12.324
as the Antimatter wave
obliterates all existence,

33:13.241 --> 33:14.868
even their own.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.829
Do you think this plan of yours
has a chance of succeeding?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.957
Logically? No.

33:22.083 --> 33:25.587
But you have proven to me
that only by taking action

33:25.670 --> 33:28.882
can one transform doom into salvation.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.266
Are you ready?

33:39.100 --> 33:41.311
Giving me a portion
of your life-force energy.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.522
You sure this is necessary?

33:45.815 --> 33:49.486
Since meeting you,
| have learned to be certain of nothing.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.200
| do know...

33:56.451 --> 33:57.702
this is dangerous.

34:00.080 --> 34:00.997
Then hit it.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.460

Charles Halstead, originally of Earth-2,
you are needed.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.742
| am a Harbinger of the destruction

to the wrong place.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.547
| know of your ability
to move between realities.

37:38.631 --> 37:42.719
You've traveled to many Earths
trying to remake them in your image,

37:42.802 --> 37:44.512
but you always fail.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.264
[Charles] Well...

37:47.557 --> 37:49.184
Try, try again.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.687

Soon all realities will end,

38:22.592 --> 38:27.222
You begin to intrigue me.
Who is this Monitor?

38:27.305 --> 38:30.475
He is the only entity
in the known universe

38:30.558 --> 38:33.978
with the knowledge and desire
to save all realities.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.481
Is he indeed?

38:37.357 --> 38:38.483
| hope so.

For all our sakes.

-[Superman] Earth-18, all...

Wait a minute.

38:52.789 --> 38:53.915
I've got contact.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.708
[Mr. Terrific] Can you confirm,
Earth-18?

38:55.792 --> 38:57.544
It's on the very edge
of my vision, but...

38:57.627 --> 38:58.962

We really don't have the infrastructure
to take care of something like this.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.210
Hey, you guys do a great job,
considering your situation here.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.214
[Atomic Knight] I'd better help
them replace those coolant conduits

43:53.297 --> 43:54.382
before the next one hits.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.217
Farewell.

44:13.192 --> 44:16.445
Cheer up. We did it. Everyone made it.

44:17.405 --> 44:18.447
[sarcastically] Hooray.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.700
We saved radioactive cinder Earth.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.995

46:52.393 --> 46:53.477
You don't know me.

46:53.561 --> 46:55.938
I'm Solovar of Gorilla City on Earth-1.

46:56.647 --> 47:00.151
And | know what it means
to be in the minority.

47:00.985 --> 47:01.986
Liar.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.738
Your kind have been
hunting me all my life.

47:04.405 --> 47:06.240
Taught me to run, hide...

47:08.326 --> 47:10.745

-[gun cocks]
-To trust.

That's it, please! [coughs] I'm done.

47:25.718 --> 47:28.387
[gasping] | can't...
| can't do any more.

47:28.471 --> 47:29.889
[groaning]

47:29.972 --> 47:32.266
[Monitor] You're the only one
who can do it.

47:33.642 --> 47:36.437
Without you broadcasting
calm and confidence,

47:36.520 --> 47:40.441
there would be panic and chaos
on all the surviving Earths.

47:41.942 --> 47:42.985
It's too hard.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.071
[gasps] Warmth.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.948
[breathing shakily] Compassion, caring.

47:48.532 --> 47:52.453
They're too complex,
even with this amplifier.

47:53.871 --> 47:54.914
I'm sorry.

47:56.207 --> 48:00.544
| don't have enough power
to influence that many people.

48:00.628 --> 48:02.171
[gasps] But...

48:03.255 --> 48:06.509
Uh, no, no, never mind. It's impossible.

48:07.551 --> 48:08.386
What?

48:10.262 --> 48:14.058
It's clear that you possess
almost unfathomable power.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.853
Grant me even a fraction of it,

48:18.687 --> 48:23.109
| could help so many
on all the various Earths.

48:24.026 --> 48:25.444
But it's impossible.

48:26.529 --> 48:27.988
Impossible, why?

48:29.865 --> 48:32.576
My past is an open book to you.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.955
Trusting me would be
the height of folly.

48:37.665 --> 48:42.294
Learning to trust
was the beginning of wisdom for me.

48:44.505 --> 48:45.589
What are you doing?

48:51.345 --> 48:52.930
[energy warbling]

48:53.889 --> 48:55.433
[screaming]

49:00.855 --> 49:01.939
[Psycho Pirate gasping]

49:04.733 --> 49:05.818
[gasps]

49:06.819 --> 49:07.903
Incredible.

49:09.238 --> 49:10.239
The power.

49:11.490 --> 49:14.160
Mar Novu... why?

49:15.202 --> 49:16.954
| am very old, Charles.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.458
But I am only now
beginning to understand

49:20.541 --> 49:22.710
that knowledge is nearly useless...

49:25.004 --> 49:26.422
without a degree of faith.

49:33.721 --> 49:34.722
[computers beeping]

49:36.640 --> 49:39.852
Okay. Let's review
what little we do know.

49:39.935 --> 49:41.437
-[sighs in exasperation]
-Oh, come on.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.355
-We've been over this.
-Ugh.

49:43.439 --> 49:44.356
[speaking Japanese]

49:44.440 --> 49:46.442
[in English] One,
what we originally thought

49:46.525 --> 49:49.528
was a one-time threat,
an antimatter tsunami,

49:49.612 --> 49:52.615
turned out to be an ongoing storm
with multiple waves.

49:52.698 --> 49:56.035
The waves can change
in speed, intensity,

49:56.118 --> 49:58.037
and arrive without
any predictable pattern.

49:58.704 --> 50:00.706
Exactly the way waves don't act.

50:01.832 --> 50:05.586
Uncharacteristic behavior leads
to many uncomfortable questions.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.172
During the Gordanian War,

50:08.255 --> 50:11.717
Thanagarian prisoners were awoken
by their captors at all hours

50:11.800 --> 50:13.010
as a method of torture.

50:13.093 --> 50:14.970
Torture implies a torturer.

50:15.054 --> 50:17.598
Are you saying this isn't
a cosmic natural phenomenon,

50:17.681 --> 50:20.684
but an attack by some sentient being?

50:20.768 --> 50:22.102
That's ridiculous.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.021
[The Question] Just because
an answer is ludicrous

50:24.104 --> 50:25.439
doesn't mean it isn't correct.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.442
Maybe in your world, weirdo.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.653
Who invited Conspiracy Guy here anyway?

50:32.947 --> 50:35.032
I'm sticking my tongue out at you.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.785
-He's weird, but often right.
-[Wonder Woman] We're wasting time.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.078
[Doctor Light] | bet you read
Ayn Rand unironically.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.371
[Mr. Terrific] Can everybody focus here?

50:40.996 --> 50:44.542
All your worlds are in jeopardy,
and questions are not only welcome

50:44.625 --> 50:47.253
but necessary to the scientific method.

50:47.336 --> 50:51.799
The fact remains
that whatever the source,

50:51.882 --> 50:56.804
these attacks continue to come
in all universes to each of the Earths.

50:56.887 --> 51:01.225
And it's only a matter of time
before one of our towers gives out.

51:01.308 --> 51:02.851
Eventually, they all will.

51:03.978 --> 51:06.981
Everything ends... forever.

51:08.941 --> 51:11.860
Since we don't know the source,
we can't attack it.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.320
The only other option is escape.

51:14.113 --> 51:15.364
And there's nowhere to go.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.991
[Mr. Terrific] You might just
have something there.

51:17.575 --> 51:18.576
Escape to nowhere.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.413
There's a theoretical dimension
called Netherspace.

51:23.330 --> 51:27.042
What if we use the towers
to broadcast your transmatter beam

51:27.126 --> 51:28.586
to move all the Earths there?

51:29.378 --> 51:31.255
A commendable idea.

51:31.338 --> 51:32.590
Unfortunately,

51:32.673 --> 51:36.635
the power required to move
those worlds would be...

51:37.928 --> 51:39.680
nearly incalculable.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.650
[Blue Beetle] You're not fooling anyone.

51:53.319 --> 51:55.321
Oh, hello.

51:56.071 --> 51:58.949
| know exactly who you are,
Doctor Spectro.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.537
[sighs] That was a lifetime ago.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.623
| have been known
on many different worlds

52:05.706 --> 52:07.541
by many different names.

52:09.043 --> 52:11.962
| try to match the name to the world.

52:12.046 --> 52:12.963
"Spectro."

52:14.506 --> 52:18.218
A ridiculous name
for your ridiculous world.

52:18.302 --> 52:20.679
| was Rainbow Warrior on another.

52:20.763 --> 52:24.099
Told them my real name
was Roy G. Bivolo.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.226
Like the rainbow?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.395
Red, orange, yellow-- [sighs]

52:28.479 --> 52:29.647
Nobody gets it.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.107
You can't charm your way
out of this, Doctor.

52:32.191 --> 52:36.070
I'm gonna let everyone know that
you're a dangerous criminal sociopath.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.406
Sociopath?

52:39.490 --> 52:43.410
You'd need a proper diagnosis
from a professional for that.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.703
-Besides...
-[energy warbling]

52:45.496 --> 52:47.456
[in echoing voice] You like me.

52:47.539 --> 52:50.793
You know your powers
won't work on me, Spectro.

52:50.876 --> 52:51.794
My will is...

52:51.877 --> 52:53.504
[weakly] ...too strong.

52:55.798 --> 52:57.508
[in normal voice]
My continued existence,

52:57.591 --> 52:59.218
painful as it is,

52:59.301 --> 53:01.095
is my primary impulse.

53:01.970 --> 53:03.472
Simply speaking,

53:04.348 --> 53:08.143
| have no choice
but to help you save the universe.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.354
[screaming]

53:10.437 --> 53:13.607
[grunting] What...
what's happening to me?

53:13.691 --> 53:16.151
[grunting] Beetle, do something!

53:16.902 --> 53:18.320
-[energy warbling]
-[screaming]

53:22.700 --> 53:23.701
<i>Spectra?</i>

53:28.330 --> 53:29.540
[chuckles]

53:29.623 --> 53:30.916
| always liked that guy.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.086
[energy warbling]

53:36.922 --> 53:39.758
-[Hawkman] Satellite, this is Earth-19.
-[sensors beeping]

53:39.842 --> 53:41.927
| have a visual on the anomaly.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.806
This is the shortest period
between waves we've experienced.

53:47.099 --> 53:49.601
-Is this a confirmed sighting, Hawkman?
-[Hawkman] No question.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.938
In fact, the light seems
to be brighter than before.

53:56.108 --> 53:58.652
Brighter? | don't like it.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.654
These waves are already inconsistent.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.407
This is Earth-1.
I've got a sighting here.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.743
It looks more intense somehow.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.455
Cycle up all towers immediately.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.209
[tower powering up]

54:36.106 --> 54:38.525
Satellite, something's
different about this one.

54:38.609 --> 54:39.943
-[rumbling intensifies]
-It's not a wave.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.452
Earth-2 to Satellite.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.662
A blinding light here,
but not much damage.

54:51.705 --> 54:52.873
[electronic beeping]

54:53.832 --> 54:56.418
Multiple Earths are calling in
to report the same, Batman.

54:57.294 --> 54:58.796
Maybe this one was just a dud.

54:59.588 --> 55:00.506
Maybe.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.634
[electronic chirping]

55:05.677 --> 55:07.262
[ghostly breathing]

55:11.266 --> 55:13.143
[snarling]

55:18.232 --> 55:19.566
[growling]

55:26.240 --> 55:29.409
Satellite, reporting
an unusual development from Earth-2.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.620
If it's to tell us that
some kind of shadow demons

55:31.703 --> 55:33.080
are peeling themselves off the walls,

55:33.163 --> 55:35.457
save your breath. You're not so special.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.459
We've got about a million
of them on our hands.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.795

55:58.939 --> 56:00.691
[demons growling]

56:11.285 --> 56:14.496
-Great Caesar's ghost.
-1 only wish it was.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.541
Welcome to hell.

56:18.709 --> 56:20.127
[soft growling]

56:23.380 --> 56:24.464
[Psycho Pirate grunts]

56:25.382 --> 56:26.383
Where am |?

56:26.466 --> 56:27.593
[echoing voice] Nowhere.

56:28.719 --> 56:29.553
Here.

56:30.429 --> 56:31.513
Inside me.

56:34.933 --> 56:38.353
-Why do you help them?
-[Psycho Pirate] What?

56:38.437 --> 56:41.523
-Who?
-[echoing voice] The others.

56:42.608 --> 56:46.361
Him. Especially him.

56:47.446 --> 56:49.031
The Monitor?

56:49.114 --> 56:50.157
[echoing voice] Yes.

56:51.199 --> 56:52.326
Monitor.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.120
[Psycho Pirate] Who are you?
Do you have a name?

56:56.163 --> 56:59.333
[echoing voice] What is a name?

56:59.416 --> 57:02.836
It's just a word that means you,

57:02.920 --> 57:05.923
like Charles or the Monitor.

57:06.715 --> 57:07.716
[echoing voice] Not like Monitor!

57:08.675 --> 57:11.970
Nothing like him! He opposes me.

57:13.138 --> 57:15.265
Obviously, you're nothing like him.

57:15.349 --> 57:16.850
You're the opposite of him.

57:16.934 --> 57:18.477
You're the Anti-Monitor.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.811
[Anti-Monitor] Yes.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.815
Anti-Monitor. Yes.

57:25.317 --> 57:27.152
But why do you help him?

57:27.235 --> 57:29.154
What other choice do | have?

57:30.656 --> 57:32.699
[Anti-Monitor] You can
change the others, Charles.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.744
Make them feel the way you feel.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.456
It hurts when they don't feel like you.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.168
But you cannot change them all.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.713
-Charles...
- I can try.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.801
[Anti-Monitor] There are
too many... people.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.554
What if you had your own universe...

57:55.806 --> 57:58.308
full of people who felt
whatever you feel?

57:59.977 --> 58:01.353
You would be...

58:02.604 --> 58:03.855
Their king.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.858
[Anti-Monitor] Their God.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.157

They're intangible.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.025
-1 killed one!
-[Mr. Terrific] Negative, Superman.

58:48.775 --> 58:52.279
Our initial data indicates these things
are actually a single creature.

58:52.362 --> 58:53.864
[Doctor Light] In other words,
keep shooting.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.533
[Monitor] It's an intelligence,

58:56.616 --> 58:59.202
a being attacking all reality.

58:59.286 --> 59:00.579
All existence.

59:01.913 --> 59:03.290
Incredible.

59:03.915 --> 59:06.293
[The Question] First time you've
been surprised in a billion years.

59:07.044 --> 59:09.296
You should have questioned
your own infallibility.

59:10.297 --> 59:13.675
Hippolyta to Satellite.
Earth-46 tower in jeopardy.

59:14.426 --> 59:17.512
These demons are impervious
to my Amazons' attacks.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.473
[Mr. Terrific] They are potentially
vulnerable to light attacks,

59:19.556 --> 59:20.849
Queen Hippolyta.

59:20.932 --> 59:22.476
Don't let them reach that tower.

59:23.643 --> 59:26.563
- I must help my sisters.
-[Monitor] Diana.

59:26.646 --> 59:29.524
Earth-46 is an Amazon-ruled Earth,

59:30.275 --> 59:32.235
but they are not your sisters.

59:32.319 --> 59:34.488
And that is not your mother.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.823
Maybe not, but they're close enough.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.242
And they're alive.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.953
| plan to keep them that way.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.571
[Earth-2 Robin] Let there be light.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.118
And there was light.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.370
And it was good.

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.752
[Huntress] Give 'em hell, Bat family.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:41.930
Growing up, my father taught me
to stick close to the shadows.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.766
But | guess this is a little
too damn close.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.434

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.998

significantly bright to harm them.

We'll get you back up to the Satellite.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:39.983
They'll fix you right up.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.610
Too late.

Stay alert. They'll be back.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.451
Stay alive, boy.

Forgive me. Hippolyta.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.862
You're so much like
my own adopted mother.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:54.159
She died along with all the Amazons
in a horrible war.

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.997
Strange then, that you didn't die
in battle alongside them.

I'm immortal. | cannot die.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.546
[scoffs] Must be nice.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.176
An eternity watching
people die in front of me?

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.763
It isn't a gift. It's a curse.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.641
Again. Forgive me.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.310
No forgiveness is necessary.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:23.688
We are grateful for your help,

-How wonderful.
-Our planet, Themesterra,

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:33.656
is a rare pearl.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.161
The shadows flee
at intensely bright light.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.371
Is there sufficient electricity
nearby, to--

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:41.998
When we threw off male oppression,

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.293
we discarded the infernal
wheel of technology as well.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.546
It did not agree with our ways.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.507
Are all the men...

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.842
They live still. Controlled.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:06.356
Get them.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:09.150
And torches, lanterns,
anything that casts a light.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.446
By the goddesses grant
they may be enough.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.748
[grunts] Sorry, | didn't...

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:24.874
Wow.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.835
In a ship
full of weird costumes... um...

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:31.297
So you're a psychotic pirate
or something?

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:33.591
Yes.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:37.554
Yes, that's it, exactly.

| didn't know until you said it.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:43.226
When in Rome, right? I'm Charles.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.770
Where are you rushing off to?

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:50.149
Well, now there's some kind
of shadow army attacking the towers.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.278
Monitor ordered me back to Earth-1
to help hold them back.

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:57.282
You must be anxious
to get your hands on them.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:00.243
We have to keep those towers going.

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:05.999
We all saw what happened
to your Legion friends.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:10.420
These creatures are surely responsible.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:16.009
I'm sure you're feeling
a little payback is in order.

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:20.179
Um... I...

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.599
I...

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.018
-[grunts]
-[Psycho Pirate] They need

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.437
to really feel it.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.439
What do you have left
except for revenge?

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.276
As Long John Silver says...

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:37.196
[in accent] "Thems that die
will be the lucky ones."

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.407
[Supergirl sighs]

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:56.215
[exhaling deeply]

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.263
[energy pulsing]

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.225
[rumbling intensifies]

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:12.273
[demons snarling]

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:13.524
I've got this area covered.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.109
You're not the only one
who can light it up, Doctor.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:19.447
No, | simply do it better.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.492
Why don't you take your novelty jewelry
and cover the southwest corner?

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.952
-Call me if you need help.
-Don't hold your breath, Doc.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:27.830
I've been in more firefights
than you'll ever know.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.212
[demons snarl]

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:49.852
About time you got down here.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.939
Heat vision. Your brightest intensity.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:55.566
Karal

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:57.985
Heat vision.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.577
-[demon screeching]
-[Supergirl exclaims]

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.287
[Superman] Kara!

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.042
Oh, you're gonna pay for that, ugly.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.213
-Kara!
-[Supergirl] Long live the Legion!

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:18.715
-[demon growls]
-[Supergirl screams]

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:19.924

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:26.180
[doors opening]

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:28.683
Kara? What is it? What's wrong?

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:31.811
Mother? How? You're alive?

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.772
[exclaims] | must have been dreaming.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.400
But it was so real.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:40.528
Kal-El was there and he was older,
and all my friends...

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.363
-And you were--
-Dead?

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:46.409
[chuckles softly] Of course,
dear, because | am dead.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.495
Everyone on Krypton is dead.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.206
What?

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:53.875
[Brainiac 5] Perhaps | can explain.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.711
[Supergirl] Brainy! Dawnstar!

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.714
...I don't understand.
What's happening? Are you...

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.048
[Brainiac 5] No, we're not dead.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.760
Because we were never alive.

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.138
We've been erased from existence.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.976
Everything we've ever done,
or thought, or said,

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:15.438
is gone... forever.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:16.647
[gasping]

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.407
[Anti-Monitor] It's terrible, isn't it?

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.994
He seems to enjoy the view.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.246
[Supergirl] | know.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:35.541
| know. He just came and watched.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.838
Interesting. You think he just happened
to be in the neighborhood

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:43.508
when your planet blew up? Huh.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:46.260
What? What are you saying?

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:53.351
On my world, a shockingly high number
of firefighters are serial arsonists.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.020
It's strange, isn't it?

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.898
[Anti-Monitor] This Monitor
has been present

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:02.360
for every major galactic tragedy
in your history.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.279
And many before that.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.033
-Interesting coincidence.
-No.

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:10.409
[ominous music plays]

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:17.792
[sobbing]

[Psycho Pirate] /It doesn't
have to be this way, Kara.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:23.631
You can fight back, save them all.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.884
Your mother, your friends.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.761
Your cousin.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.429
[Anti-Monitor] The universe
can be remade.

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:32.640
It can be rectified.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.476
How?

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.562
[Anti-Monitor] You must strike
at your enemy.

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:39.564
Your kidnapper.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.275
Your monster.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.946
You're the only one who can do it, Kara.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:51.576
You're the only one
who can save the universe.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.038
Save us all.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.258

[electronic beeping]

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:39.248
| told you to stay away.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:44.003
The actual phrase
you're looking for is "Thank you."

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.714
Well, at least we know
this Bruce is just like ours.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.885
I'm nothing like your Batman.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.931
| don't recruit children to fight
in a war. How many died?

01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:57.058
They knew the risks.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.603
That Batman is a fool.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.396
I'll tell you what he wasn't.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.397
Alone.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:09.070
He was a great man.
He gave us a purpose. You don't know.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.571
Leave Father alone.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:11.948
Who are you to question him?

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.909
He's not your father,
you little whack job.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.286
Take that back.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.250

Oh, big man, shoving kids around.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:38.557
You made a misery out of my adolescence.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.851
Damned if I'll stand by
and watch you do... [grunts]

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.103
[Batman] | was right

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.647
to drop your counterpart
at the orphanage.

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:48.359

Fire doesn't harm these demons,

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:17.013
but at least it hinders
their advance. [grunts]

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:21.350
Your Amazons fight bravely.
But where are the men?

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:24.020
They are sealed into their quarters,
whenever we go to war.

-[grunts]
-You're losing this battle.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:32.403
The men must be released
so they can fight alongside us.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:36.991
You must be mad. They cannot be trusted.

-[Hippolyta grunts]

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.953

You don't know what this world was like
before our revolution.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.751
A hell for our kind.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:50.379
| believe you,
but you must fight together or die.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:56.135

considering arming the men.

Light, stop!

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:33.422
We need to fight the shadows,
not each other.

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:36.842
Why should I limit myself
to one enemy? [grunts]

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.763
[grunts] Okay, lady's gone crazy.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:45.893

Got any more?

Hey, old timer.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.827
This place is too dangerous for...

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:04.662
Wait a minute.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.539
| know you.

01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:10.000
You'd think those little blue blokes

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:13.462
would know how to make a ring
that'd hold a charge better.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:17.174
You said the worlds
were ending. You knew.

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:18.425
Are you a part of this?

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:21.887
Hey.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.473
Not so fast, Gramps.

01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:34.358
What... [gasps]

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:35.985
What the hell?

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:45.161
[Monitor] Charles,
why are you doing this?

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.873
Broadcasting hate, fear, distrust?

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:53.127
I'm just giving more
of what they already have.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.881
Your actions have no logical motive.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:00.384
[Psycho Pirate]
When | helped you before,

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.678
there was no other option.

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:04.847
Now | have a choice.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.809
What other option, Charles?

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.521
There is only destruction, oblivion.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:18.110
[Psycho Pirate] Wrong.
There is the Anti-Monitor.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.322
Anti-Monitor?

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:25.367

There is no more Charles.

-Please.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.376
You believe in me at last.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.838
As I've said, you are a delusion,

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.341
a manifestation of my own inability

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.801
to account for
the astronomical unlikelihood

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:49.303
of knowable existence.

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:51.889
It matters little.

you have come to experience empathy.

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:02.024
[Monitor] This... caring
has cost me much.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.027
Why must | suffer it?

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:08.197
[scoffs]

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:11.325
You believe you're paying the cost now?

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.453
Since the very dawn of time,

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.955
you have been absorbing
more galactic power.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.419
What good has my power done?

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.633
All reality is being ripped to pieces.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:30.636
[The Spectre] To whom much is given,

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.721
much will be required.

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.057
You are not paying yet.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:39.186
But when the time comes, you must.

01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:05.379
[grunts]

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:12.094
-[clangs]
-[grunts]

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.011
[man] Come on.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.348
Really, let me have it.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.976
No one will miss an old pariah like me.

01:22:20.561 --> 01:22:22.479
Show me what you got, Green Lantern.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.149
| told you,

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.943
Green Lantern isn't my name.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:30.028
It's my job.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:34.867
My name is...

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:36.743
John!

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:38.912
[man] That's it.

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.789
That's my name.

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:46.420
I've been trying to think of it
for 100 years, 1,000 years.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.299
No one has called me that
in a long, long time.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:52.926
It's all coming back.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:55.512
What are you?

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:57.473
What am | now?

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:01.560
| used to be one of the most
powerful sorcerers on Earth.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:05.314
Bloke name of John Constantine.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.194
[mystical chiming]

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:14.948
Ta-da.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.494
Still enough juice
to pull off a clean-up spell.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.163
Clean-up spell?

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.623
You still look like hell.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:27.044
Uh, nice rhyming, sunshine.
Well, what do you expect?

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:29.296
I haven't had a ciggie in, I reckon,

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.716
a thousand years. [groans]

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:37.804
Toughest part of quitting
is the first 100 years.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:40.098
Don't wanna be going through that again.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.226
If you're some kind of magician,

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:44.895
why don't you just
magic up something to stop 'em?

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:48.607
Hello? | just remembered my name.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.359
My bag of tricks
is not quite up to this.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:55.239
Ugh, it looks like I'm elected. Again.

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:00.452
[all grunting]

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:06.333
[demons snarling]

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:07.918
[yelling]

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.507
[demons growling]

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:17.886
[John] In brightest day...

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:20.597
Oi, speed it up a bit, mate.

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:22.182
In blackest night,

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.602
no evil shall escape my sight.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:27.646
Let those who worship evil...

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:34.403
They're afraid.

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:36.530
-Afraid of this light.
-[buzzing intensifies]

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:40.242
Look here, I'm no expert,
but | think you're overcharging.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.452
That's a bad sound.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:46.623
[groans] Oh, it's gonna get a lot worse.

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:48.917
-[buzzing intensifies]
-[Constantine] You're overloading.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.296
[groans] Damn straight it is.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:54.214
[groans]

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:56.800
Get your bloody hand out!

01:24:58.302 --> 01:24:59.303
[grunts]

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.027
Slipped into something more comfortable?

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.405
Left my power ring in there.

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:20.949
Had to make sure it'd blow.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:23.285
It was worth it.

01:25:25.037 --> 01:25:26.204
[demons warbling]

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:32.753
Good man, John.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:37.758
[all grunting]

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:40.927
[demons snarl]

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.268
[both grunting]

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.106
[breathing heavily]

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:56.818
[yells]

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.487
[yelling, grunting]

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.543
[demons warbling]

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:15.545
[both grunting]

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:19.591
[clangs]

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:22.260
[both yelling]

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:25.305
[chuckles]

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.141
[demon snarls]

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:29.434
[Huntress groaning]

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:34.648
[gasps] Dad.

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:36.483
[Batman grunting]

01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:37.442
Bruce.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.863
Don't just stand there! Help him!

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.282
[demons snarl]

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:48.954
[beeping]

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:57.963
[groans softly]

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:05.178
Huh? Where'd they go?

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.139
They're retreating.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.058
| don't like the look of this.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.477
They were about to slag
the whole planet.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.104
Why break off their attack?

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:16.940
They're not.
They're changing the target.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.568
Batman to Satellite. Code Red.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:21.653
Transmat me aboard immediately.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:26.116
Start moving all available operatives
to Earth-1 tower as quickly as possible.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.451
It's bad.

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.411
Bad enough.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.792
[demons snarling]

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.677
Their numbers are growing, dammit.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.846
More and more of them
are arriving all the time.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:01.234
[demons chortling, warbling]

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.293
[growling]

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:23.757
A single creature.

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.926
That's all it ever was.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:28.762
Pieces of a whole.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:32.265
Shadow demons were susceptible
to light attacks.

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:34.100
This thing should be no different.

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:42.442
[roaring]

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.115
[roaring]

01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.042
[Monitor] Wrong.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.711
| was wrong about it all.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.550
Not a phenomenon, a sentience.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:08.343
Not a wave, an army.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:10.971
And now, a being.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:13.765
| see.

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.560
Then this is all your fault.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.272
Yes, it is.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:26.027
All living things,
in all realities, are about to die.

01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:28.655
And | killed them.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.075
[The Spectre] A remarkable change.

01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:36.037
Millions of years of cold observation,

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.831
bottomless indifference.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.252
And now, it's all your fault.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:47.007
| would give anything to save them.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:50.760
Would you indeed?

01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:56.516
[energy warbling]

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.064
Oh.

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:05.025
Yes.

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:08.194
| see, of course.

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:11.615
You've watched billions die.

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:14.034
Yes.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.077
Murderer!

01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:22.834
-[growls]
-It's working. Keep it up.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:26.671
[groaning]

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.051
It's growing a shell.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.887
[metallic clanging]

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:51.029
Worse. Armor.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.406
It's adapting again.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:05.752
[roaring]

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:12.008
[sizzling]

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:22.727
[groaning]

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:25.814
[groans softly]

01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:32.153
[sobs] No. No.

01:31:33.279 --> 01:31:34.531
What have | done?

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.373
[energy buzzing]

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:48.294
[buzzing intensifies]

01:31:56.219 --> 01:31:57.512
[Anti-Monitor] Now...

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:00.223
die.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:09.524
[instrumental music playing]
