WEBVTT

01:08.468 --> 01:09.971
Hi!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.172
Uh, you guys must be
new to town, right?

01:12.272 --> 01:14.107
New to town,
but not new to the country.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.511
We just moved from California.
We speak English.

01:16.611 --> 01:17.946
Oh, that's wonderful!
So do we!

01:20.447 --> 01:21.649
Um... Um...

01:21.749 --> 01:23.585
We're just curious.

01:23.685 --> 01:25.587
Um... are you Chinese?

01:27.187 --> 01:30.223
- Yes.
- Oh, great.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.027
Uh, we just wondered
if you would mind

01:33.126 --> 01:34.762
if your daughter played
with our daughter?

01:35.597 --> 01:36.864
Why our daughter?

01:36.965 --> 01:39.433
Oh! Oh, no, we just thought
Audrey might like to meet her.

01:39.534 --> 01:42.102
- Yeah.
- Audrey, say hi.

01:54.716 --> 01:56.584
You wanna play slide?

01:56.684 --> 01:57.685
Mmm-hmm.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.760
Slide's off limits
to Ching-Chongs.

02:07.862 --> 02:08.895
Fuck you.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.236
You wanna be best friends?

02:33.521 --> 02:36.057
My grandpa's name
is Joe, just like my dad's.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.060
He loves model trains,
and he has a gout.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.327
Why don't you look
like your family?

02:40.427 --> 02:42.030
'Cause I'm adopted from China.

02:42.130 --> 02:44.132
That's why I have a birth mom.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.767
I'd be so mad
if my parents gave me up.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.101
Did you do something?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.169
Her mom didn't
want her, obviously.

02:53.608 --> 02:54.642
Are you okay?

02:56.476 --> 02:58.245
You know what?
Fuck everyone else.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.115
You don't have to prove
anything to these losers.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.337
Ten, four, let's go, boss.

03:57.437 --> 03:58.405
You sure you're ready
for China?

03:58.506 --> 04:01.142
I got this, Frank.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.944
They do things
differently there.

04:03.044 --> 04:06.581
I'll close the deal.
Don't worry about that.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.583
You worried about that?

04:08.683 --> 04:09.884
Oh, fuck!

04:09.984 --> 04:11.451
Ah! Fuck!

04:11.552 --> 04:13.187
Oh, Jesus Christ! Cover that!

04:13.286 --> 04:14.387
Hey.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.656
God, this game fuckin' sucks.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.391
-Good game.
-Good game, boss.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.961
Thanks, Kevin.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.196
Mike C. Mike D.
Mike J. Michael.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.565
Josh. James. Dave. Other Dave.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.333
Michael again. Good seein' ya.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.103
Uh, eleven to four.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.705
Kicked my ass again, Sullivan.

04:30.805 --> 04:32.106
That's pretty good for a...

04:32.206 --> 04:33.608
-Woman.
-Asian.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.877
No, I was gonna
say "associate."

04:35.977 --> 04:38.646
Wait, can we say "Asian"
anymore or is that offensive?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.248
We can't say anything anymore.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.783
You're goddamn right, Kevin!
So shut the fuck up!

04:41.883 --> 04:45.119
I'm an ally.
I shop at 99 Ranch Market.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.353
Some of us are doin' the work.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.955
Yes. I really appreciated

04:48.055 --> 04:51.025
-that <i>Mulan-themed</i>
office birthday party.
-You're welcome.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.326
So, uh, you excited
for Beijing?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.263
I didn't know
you speak Chinese.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.831
Well, I'm not fluent

04:56.931 --> 04:58.498
but I have an excellent grasp
of conversational Mandarin.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.268
Yeah? How do you say,

05:00.367 --> 05:03.504
"I have an excellent grasp
of conversational Mandarin"
in Mandarin?

05:11.311 --> 05:14.314
You close ChinaWave this week,
I'm puttin' you up for partner.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.850
Took you long enough, ally.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.118
Well, come on,

05:17.218 --> 05:19.821
Ms. 3,000-Billable-Hours,
you knew this was coming.

05:19.921 --> 05:22.123
You know, if this works out,
you're gonna have
to move out to L.A.,

05:22.223 --> 05:23.291
work out of headquarters.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.126
That'd be amazing, actually.

05:25.226 --> 05:26.326
You know, I've been thinking

05:26.426 --> 05:28.129
it'd be nice to have a change.

05:28.229 --> 05:29.630
-Oh, you're gonna love LA.
-Yeah.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.267
I mean, there's a Chinatown,
a Thai Town, a Koreatown.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.435
-I mean, it's basically Asia.
-Sure.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.406
That's me off of the dick.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.943
Your dick is dust,
you pussy motherfucker!

05:42.043 --> 05:43.211
-Fuckin' dust!
-Anyway,

05:43.311 --> 05:45.580
close ChinaWave, make partner.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.114
-Don't worry. I will.
-You better.

05:47.215 --> 05:50.117
It's a big account. Good thing
you're fluent in Chinese.

05:50.218 --> 05:51.619
Yep.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.453
You know, and I actually have
a friend coming with me.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.022
She offered to be
my translator in Beijing.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.124
Oh, you have a friend who's
a professional translator?

05:57.225 --> 05:58.759
Total professional.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.801
Oh, what's up, landlord?

06:06.901 --> 06:08.502
-Sorry for the mess.
-Who are you talking to?

06:08.603 --> 06:10.504
I'm sending an Animoji
to Baron Davis

06:10.605 --> 06:11.839
with this cute bear.

06:11.939 --> 06:12.773
Look. Check it out.

06:17.245 --> 06:18.546
Oh.

06:18.646 --> 06:19.981
You have no idea
what I'm saying.

06:20.081 --> 06:22.683
No, I have an idea.
Who is Baron Davis?

06:22.783 --> 06:24.785
Basketball player.
Two-time NBA All-Star.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.687
Anyway, he's playin'
in China now.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.523
Since we're goin' to Beijing,
I slid in his DMs.

06:29.624 --> 06:31.125
He's learning the language,
so I'm teaching him.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.459
If you need help translating,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.061
I talked to Kat,
and she lives there now.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.395
-Ah, yes.
-So like if...

06:35.495 --> 06:37.698
Katherine Huang.
Your famous college roommate.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.267
- Yeah.
- Actress.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.768
-Okay.
-Spokesmodel.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.204
Lolo two-point-worse.

06:43.304 --> 06:44.972
Don't...

06:45.072 --> 06:46.974
You do understand
it's really important

06:47.074 --> 06:48.109
for me to be professional

06:48.209 --> 06:49.210
-the entire time...
-Of course.

06:49.310 --> 06:51.444
Audrey, I got you. Look at me.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.548
-You're thinking about a dick.
-Damn it. You're right.

06:54.649 --> 06:56.384
-But I'm a fellow profesh.
-Yeah. I know.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.653
Trust me. Oh, let me show you
my latest work.

06:58.753 --> 07:01.689
-Come on. It's at
the restaurant.
-Uh, it's... Okay.

07:04.325 --> 07:05.726
Licky cat. Ooh.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.495
See? It's like
a lucky cat except...

07:08.596 --> 07:09.664
-Yeah, no, I get it.
-The tongue?

07:09.764 --> 07:11.431
-I get it.
-Ready for this?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.568
The Look-Closer Lotus.

07:14.669 --> 07:16.170
-Look-Closer at wha... Oh, wow.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.571
-Vaginas.
-Mmm-hmm. Pussy petals.

07:17.672 --> 07:19.472
-There's a lot of 'em.
-And this,

07:19.573 --> 07:23.577
my <i>piece de resistance...</i>

07:23.678 --> 07:25.212
"Adult Playground."

07:25.313 --> 07:26.714
- Oh. Whoa!
- Mmm-hmm.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.015
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.418
Is this the playground
we went to as kids?

07:30.518 --> 07:32.420
Fuck yeah.
Look, titty sandbox.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.487
This is chaotic.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.091
That's what my art is
all about. Inspiring chaos.

07:37.191 --> 07:40.061
Challenging fetishes that
Asian people have to deal with

07:40.161 --> 07:41.128
around sexuality.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.530
I mean, it's just a lot.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.831
I hope someone likes it.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.833
I could really use
a commission right now.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.668
If you really need money,
you could pick up
some shifts here.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.936
Your parents need the help.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.470
I'm not tryin'
to be a sell-out.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.606
-I'm a starving artist.
-Mmm.

07:52.707 --> 07:54.442
I could bring one
of my pieces to Beijing.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.210
Lolo, this is such
an important work...

07:56.310 --> 07:57.878
-Work trip. Work trip.
-Right.

07:57.979 --> 07:59.847
-Or... And just hear me out.
-No. No. No "or."

07:59.947 --> 08:02.917
What if it's our first annual
best friends trip? You and me.

08:03.017 --> 08:06.087
Romy and Michele.
Bert and Elmo.

08:06.187 --> 08:08.456
-Ernie.
-Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.057
I love the idea
of an annual trip

08:10.157 --> 08:11.659
but you're gonna have
to save some money.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.527
-Yeah.
-You're saving money
by living with me.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.795
And I'm so grateful.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.397
And it's been really fun
but I don't know,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.299
like, maybe I don't wanna live
in White Hills my whole life.

08:18.399 --> 08:20.101
Why not? This is home.

08:20.201 --> 08:21.602
Right, but...

08:21.702 --> 08:24.672
Lolo... we told you to stop
bringing your art in here.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.374
I ran out of space at Audrey's.

08:26.474 --> 08:27.742
Put it away.
We have to go get ready.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.844
-Okay, I'm coming.
-We're coming.

08:31.746 --> 08:33.080
Do you wanna just...

08:33.179 --> 08:34.448
- Are we gonna leave it here?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.350
I'm not a radiologist
like Arthur.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.485
Okay.

08:38.785 --> 08:39.886
To Audrey!

08:39.986 --> 08:41.422
-To Audrey. Yes.
-Thanks for coming over.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.990
Oh. So proud of you.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.458
Guys, you didn't have
to throw a whole party.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.960
We're gonna be back in,
like, four days.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.262
We wanted to give you a nice
send-off. It's a big deal.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.597
Going to your birth country.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.965
It's a business trip.

08:51.065 --> 08:52.600
And it's so great
you're taking Lolo with you.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.368
-Anyway, we brought
<i>Hong Dou Bing.</i>
-Oh, yes.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.704
- These are red bean buns.
- Ooh.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.205
- Red bean.
- Audrey first.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.974
- Thank you so much.
They look so good.
Yes.

09:00.074 --> 09:01.510
You got the blue one.
Those are special.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.710
Will I like these?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.712
No, no. Probably not,
to be honest.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.113
-You're basically white.
-That's not true.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.648
You have a throw pillow
that says, "Wine o'clock."

09:07.748 --> 09:09.483
-Rose all day.
-You own a picnic basket.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.684
They're very useful.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.086
Name every character
on <i>Succession.</i>

09:12.186 --> 09:13.721
Logan, Kendall, Shiv, Roman...
Oh, you got me.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.991
So, I thought it would be fun
to look at some photos

09:17.091 --> 09:19.293
of Audrey from the last time
she was in China.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.695
Oh, my gosh. No. The Chens
don't wanna look at that.

09:21.796 --> 09:23.464
-That's for us.
-Yes.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.865
No, I...

09:24.965 --> 09:27.301
-Oh.
-Oh, honey, look,
this is the first time

09:27.401 --> 09:28.969
- you held her.
- Oh, God.

09:29.070 --> 09:30.505
-Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.
-So am I.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.306
- No, I know. It's cute.
- Who's this?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.607
Look at that
head of hair.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.942
Oh. Oh, that's my birth mom.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.344
How have you never
shown me this?

09:37.445 --> 09:38.846
I don't know.
It's not a big deal.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.381
- Who was that actor?
- Yeah, she...

09:40.481 --> 09:42.016
Your adoption agency's
on the back.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.885
Yeah.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.254
Should we call them
and maybe get

09:47.354 --> 09:49.223
-information on your mom?
-No. I don't wanna do that.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.759
I mean, we used to talk
about it all the time

09:51.859 --> 09:53.562
when we were little, remember?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.530
A grand adventure
to find your birth mom?

09:55.629 --> 09:57.131
No. No. That was
because we were kids.

09:57.231 --> 09:58.699
And we're adults now.
We've moved on.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.701
At least I have, okay?
So let's not do that.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.169
Anyway, why would
I need more parents

10:02.269 --> 10:04.138
when I have the two best
parents in the world?

10:04.238 --> 10:06.440
-Aw, honey.
-Oh, we love you, sweetie.

10:06.541 --> 10:07.975
You're the best.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.477
Sandwich!

10:11.546 --> 10:12.680
White people.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.448
You know what?
Another toast.

10:14.549 --> 10:17.418
To Audrey. To movin' on
and movin' up.

10:17.519 --> 10:19.053
-Moving up.
-To the best daughter

10:19.153 --> 10:21.055
and the best lawyer
you could ever have.

10:21.155 --> 10:24.191
And Lolo's gonna probably
need a lawyer someday.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.460
Get the bail money ready.

10:28.863 --> 10:30.264
Gonna need a lawyer.

10:36.137 --> 10:37.972
Guess who's goin' back
to the motherland?

10:38.072 --> 10:40.774
So, if you're in Beijing
and you have a juicy pene

10:40.875 --> 10:42.676
or a vagine hit me up.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.945
<i>Audrey, say hi.</i>

10:45.045 --> 10:46.680
- <i>No, Lolo.</i>
<i>- Audrey, say hi.</i>

10:50.951 --> 10:52.653
Hey, so I kinda
can't stop thinking

10:52.753 --> 10:54.054
about the picture
of your birth mom.

10:54.155 --> 10:55.923
-Oh.
-You sure you don't wanna
look for her?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.658
-Yep.
-It could be something fun
we do together.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.528
Lolo, I just... I'm sorry,

10:59.628 --> 11:01.162
but remember
this is a work trip.

11:01.262 --> 11:02.930
-Work trip. Work trip.
-Thank you.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.232
Deadeye's coming, by the way.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.868
-What?
-Deadeye's coming.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.870
-Deadeye, your cousin?
-She's visiting friends.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.072
And her parents, you know,
just didn't want her to fly
alone, so I'm chaperoning.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.707
A chaperone?
For a grown woman?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.776
Before you say anything,
I know what you're thinking.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.378
-Your hair grew back.
-Not really.

11:17.478 --> 11:18.812
This is why
my part is this way.

11:18.913 --> 11:21.048
Yeah. That was forever ago.
And she's different now.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.152
I promise.
Deadeye has changed.

11:25.252 --> 11:29.356
She's into music. K-pop.
You know BTS. She's full army.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.758
She's super cool now.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.760
The energy has totally shifted.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.461
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.263
-Hey, Audrey.
-Whoa! Hi. Hey.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.232
-Deadeye.
-Hi.

11:38.332 --> 11:39.601
So...

11:39.700 --> 11:41.769
-Oh, good. Hi!
-Yeah.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.205
Um, so you're...
you're flying with us?

11:44.305 --> 11:45.873
-Just flying?
-Yeah, the pleasure's mine.

11:45.973 --> 11:47.908
- Me, too.
- Yeah. Um...

11:48.008 --> 11:49.210
so, when we get to Beijing,
you're gonna meet up

11:49.310 --> 11:50.579
-with your BTS friends, right?
-Yeah.

11:50.679 --> 11:51.879
-Awesome.
-Yes.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.616
@Jinderalla88, @JHopesGirl,
@SugaIsMyDaddy.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.685
Oh, online people?

11:56.784 --> 11:57.952
Yeah, they're my best friends.

11:58.052 --> 11:59.920
I went to @Jinderalla88's
wedding on Zoom.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.255
-Awesome.
-He married a pillow.

12:01.355 --> 12:02.423
Okay.

12:02.524 --> 12:03.692
Oh, oh, one second.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.459
Those can't be real people.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.761
She's just coming to hang out
with us, obviously.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.531
-Trust me. Right when we land,
-Lolo...

12:09.631 --> 12:12.032
Deadeye is gonna peace out
and it's gonna be you and me.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.635
Do you think I can bring
these lighters onto the plane?

12:13.734 --> 12:14.768
-I really think it's illegal.
-Okay. Yeah.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.903
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.304
-Not again.
-Okay. I was wrong.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.906
- My hair. My hair.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

12:19.006 --> 12:19.840
- We should check the other two.
- Friends trip!

12:19.940 --> 12:21.242
I'm gonna take these.

12:21.342 --> 12:22.776
We're gonna priority board
and we'll see you at...

12:22.876 --> 12:24.078
- at the gate, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.379
You're gonna Venmo me
for those or...

12:25.479 --> 12:27.314
- Lolo?
- I'll sneak you some snacks.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.904
I don't think I've ever been
around only Asian people.

12:51.005 --> 12:54.074
I mean, we look like
everyone else for once.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.409
I think we blend right in.

12:55.510 --> 12:58.946
Yeah. But people here
can tell Chinese-Chinese

12:59.046 --> 13:00.615
from American-Chinese.

13:00.715 --> 13:02.182
-What do you mean?
-See?

13:02.283 --> 13:03.384
Hong Kong-Chinese.

13:03.484 --> 13:04.918
Bluetooth.

13:05.019 --> 13:07.087
Shanghai-Chinese. Bougie.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.789
Ooh, Taiwanese.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.357
- Weird, but cute.
- Aw.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.159
What kinda Chinese are they?

13:12.259 --> 13:13.762
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

13:13.861 --> 13:15.429
Are you tryin' to get canceled?
Those are Koreans.

13:15.530 --> 13:17.532
-Oh.
-That's Howdy Fun!

13:17.632 --> 13:19.133
-It's a K-pop group!
-Yeah,

13:19.233 --> 13:21.168
they all have the same face.
That's how you can tell.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.403
Mmm.

13:22.504 --> 13:24.238
I mean, why are they walking
right though security?

13:24.338 --> 13:27.441
- Because it's Howdy Fun!
- Okay.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.346
So, where...
Where are we goin'?

13:32.446 --> 13:33.347
Um, well,

13:33.447 --> 13:35.784
we are going to visit
my friend, Kat,

13:35.883 --> 13:37.686
on her set of
<i>The Emperor's Daughter.</i>

13:37.786 --> 13:39.420
Oh, I love that show.

13:39.521 --> 13:41.055
-Cool. Okay, let's go.
-Oh.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.894
Hey.
I thought you said

13:46.994 --> 13:48.295
it was just for the flight.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.963
She's hanging out with us now?

13:50.064 --> 13:51.800
I didn't even ask Kat
if she can come to set with us.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.535
Is Kat gonna make
a big deal out of it?

13:53.635 --> 13:54.803
-No. I mean, just no...
-Fuck her.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.236
Why do you have such
a problem with her?

13:56.337 --> 13:58.573
You know, you both actually
have a lot in common.

13:58.673 --> 14:01.208
I mean, you're both
very sexually...

14:01.308 --> 14:02.544
-Free?
-Yeah.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.078
She blew Nick and Joe Jonas.

14:04.178 --> 14:06.080
Not Kevin? Not impressed.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.849
She has a tattoo
on her vagina.

14:11.553 --> 14:12.953
What?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.955
She has...
She has a pussy tat?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.490
I shouldn't have told you.

14:16.591 --> 14:18.959
Um... You know what?
Forget I said anything.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.361
Yeah.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.330
Um, never, never gonna talk
about it ever again.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.033
What's it of?
Like, is it in color?

14:26.133 --> 14:27.935
Is it glow-in-the-dark?
Big? Small?

14:28.035 --> 14:30.404
Like, are pussy tats
more common than I think?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.473
Does she have one?

14:32.574 --> 14:33.941
Do they?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.580
Do you think she had, like,
ideas going in,

14:38.680 --> 14:41.248
or just pointed to the artist
and said, "Dealer's choice"?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.083
Horizontal. Vertical.
Optical illusion.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.418
It looks like a vase

14:44.519 --> 14:46.186
-but then an old lady.
-Stop talking about it.

14:47.822 --> 14:48.989
- I decided...
- Stop!

14:49.089 --> 14:50.592
-You know, I thought about it.
-Please.

14:50.692 --> 14:51.992
I thought about it. I thought
about it really, really hard.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.260
-Yes.
-And I decided I'm not gonna

14:53.360 --> 14:54.962
stop talking about it.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.665
Let's go see this trash bag
kitty cat pussy tat bitch.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.440
Cut. Cut. Cut.

15:40.608 --> 15:42.677
Bravo! Encore!

15:42.777 --> 15:44.646
- Encore!
- Audrey?

15:44.746 --> 15:47.414
Oh, my God! That was so good!

15:47.515 --> 15:48.382
You're such a big shot!

15:48.482 --> 15:49.851
Oh, come on.
You are the big shot.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.118
You big shot lawyer.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.954
Best friends reunited.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.322
Oh.

16:06.701 --> 16:09.604
Whoo!

16:09.704 --> 16:12.941
What? That was so lame.
What was that?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.609
You know, Kat and I were
part of the same

16:14.709 --> 16:15.844
college a cappella group...

16:15.944 --> 16:17.044
-The Tootles!
-Tootles!

16:17.144 --> 16:18.546
Stop!

16:18.646 --> 16:20.080
Right.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.649
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

16:21.749 --> 16:24.686
I hear that you're living
in Audrey's garage

16:24.786 --> 16:25.820
and... And drawing
penises now.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.054
Oh, no, I... Uh,

16:27.154 --> 16:28.422
I told you,
Lolo's an amazing artist.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.257
-I do body positive art.
-Interesting.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.259
And remind me your name again.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.896
My legal name is Vanessa.
Call me Deadeye.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.031
Oh, where did that...
Come from?

16:41.034 --> 16:42.302
You know, I think I get it.

16:43.505 --> 16:44.873
-Come to my chair.
-Are you serious?

16:44.973 --> 16:46.073
Come to my chair.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.909
Wait, wait. Oh, my Gosh,
this is so cool!

16:48.008 --> 16:49.443
Okay.

16:49.544 --> 16:51.178
So, when do we get
to meet your fiance?

16:51.278 --> 16:53.413
Oh. You just saw him.

16:53.515 --> 16:54.916
-He's the leading man.
-Uh...

16:55.015 --> 16:57.519
Wait, the human Mushu?

16:57.619 --> 16:58.820
Oh, there he is.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.175
Mmm.

17:23.277 --> 17:24.746
-Hey.
-Hi, honey.

17:24.846 --> 17:27.949
Hey, I'm so sorry. I had to,
uh, get outta my costume.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.584
It's just so itchy and tight.

17:29.684 --> 17:31.118
Clarence,

17:31.218 --> 17:33.788
Audrey is my best friend
from college.

17:33.888 --> 17:34.923
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh.

17:35.023 --> 17:37.090
Hi. We're best friends,
actually.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.191
Clarence and I met on the set
of the show.

17:38.292 --> 17:39.994
He plays the military hero.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.764
Oh, we just saw you.
It was
so good. You're really great.

17:42.864 --> 17:44.298
And I play the good girl.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.401
Played the good girl
in my last two dramas too.
It's...

17:47.502 --> 17:48.736
I think it's kinda my brand.

17:48.836 --> 17:50.605
She's
an absolute angel, isn't she?

17:50.705 --> 17:56.109
Kat and I thank God every day
for bringing us together.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.178
-Are you two Bible-thumpers?
-What?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.848
Oh, I... I have always
been a woman of God.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.250
I mean, remember that was one
of the first things I told you

18:03.350 --> 18:05.720
- when we met, right, Audrey?
- That...

18:05.820 --> 18:07.956
I am a good Christian girl

18:08.056 --> 18:09.356
saving myself for marriage.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.593
-Wait, what?
-Wait, wait, wait. You two...

18:12.259 --> 18:14.094
have never had sex.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.698
Our connection is
based on spiritual,

18:16.798 --> 18:18.198
not physical intimacy.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.133
Did you have
a spiritual connection

18:20.233 --> 18:22.336
when the Jonas Brothers
were Eiffel towering you?

18:22.436 --> 18:24.371
Oh, my God.

18:26.507 --> 18:29.376
Oh, my God. That's so funny.
I love Paris.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.045
Right?

18:31.144 --> 18:32.379
I gotta go. You good?
You need anything?

18:32.479 --> 18:33.915
I'm good, my love. Thank you.

18:34.015 --> 18:36.316
- Okay, come here.
- Mmm.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.019
<i>- Aw!</i>

18:40.722 --> 18:41.889
Oh. Uh...

18:41.990 --> 18:43.858
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.292
Mmm, mmm, oh, oh.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.261
-Ooh. Uh...
-Leave some room for Jesus.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.265
Yes!

18:52.366 --> 18:53.701
Yeah.

18:53.801 --> 18:55.703
- Nice to meet you all.
- So good to meet...

18:55.803 --> 18:58.072
Okay.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.473
Go away!

19:02.844 --> 19:06.279
So, has Clarence ever seen
your pussy tat?

19:09.149 --> 19:12.887
I do confess that at one point
I did have a tiny sunflower

19:12.987 --> 19:14.722
on my inner thigh.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.124
"Edgy."

19:16.223 --> 19:18.660
But it doesn't even matter
because, um, it's gone.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.061
Lasers work miracles.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.229
Okay? Gone.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.397
- Prove it.
- Lolo.

19:23.497 --> 19:26.299
Mmm.
YOLO, Lolo.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.235
You know, I used to be
like you in college

19:28.335 --> 19:29.469
but guess I just
grew out of it.

19:29.570 --> 19:32.106
Really? Oh, 'cause
you seem kinda tense

19:32.205 --> 19:34.042
from
all the no-boning.

19:34.142 --> 19:37.377
You sure you're good? You sure
you don't miss it?

19:37.477 --> 19:39.881
No tongue until the wedding
bell's rung, my friend.

19:39.981 --> 19:42.249
Okay. Um, well, we should
get going now, right?

19:42.349 --> 19:45.553
So, um, we have to go to
this place called Radiance.

19:45.653 --> 19:47.789
It's crazy
that a business meeting
is happening at a club.

19:47.889 --> 19:51.258
-But when in Rome,
do what the Romans do.
-Bathe together.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.392
- Huh.
- Well, lucky for you,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.428
I wrapped early,
so I can come now.

19:54.529 --> 19:56.296
I mean, you still need
a translator, right?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.198
-Actually Lolo offered...
-Yeah.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.277
What is that?

20:14.314 --> 20:15.683
Okay.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.153
- I like her.
- No, you don't.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.268
Okay,
we gotta find the CEO.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.038
Just remember,
it's really important for me

20:37.138 --> 20:38.139
to get him to sign tonight.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.308
Oh, shit.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.611
Hi!

20:43.711 --> 20:46.246
Hi, Mr. Lin. It's so nice
to meet you.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.882
I'm so excited to talk
about the deal.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.450
Oh. Oh.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.787
Yeah. Uh-huh.

20:52.887 --> 20:53.688
Guys, what's he saying?

20:53.788 --> 20:55.723
-Uh, Chunhwa?
-Chunhwa. Yes.

21:00.194 --> 21:01.529
Choo-choo!

21:03.898 --> 21:05.533
Oh.

21:05.633 --> 21:08.736
Yes!

21:15.610 --> 21:17.044
Honestly,
Chao's way younger

21:17.145 --> 21:18.411
than I thought
he was gonna be.

21:18.513 --> 21:20.081
-Right?
-And hot.

21:20.181 --> 21:21.281
I'd smash.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.050
Okay,
please don't hit on him.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.752
-Are you good?
-Mmm.

21:24.852 --> 21:26.554
You don't normally eat
real Chinese food.

21:26.654 --> 21:27.955
Yeah, and you don't have
to drink everything either.

21:28.055 --> 21:30.423
I heard that if you keep up
with Chinese businessmen

21:30.525 --> 21:31.893
they respect you more.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.799
- What are these?
Shit.
Thousand-year-old egg shots.

21:37.899 --> 21:39.200
So fucking good.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.035
I don't know if you can
handle it, though.

21:41.135 --> 21:42.837
They're so black and gooey.

21:42.937 --> 21:44.105
I love goo.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.088
- Audrey, you okay?
- Mmm.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.491
Mmm.

22:05.026 --> 22:06.393
Mmm, mmm.

22:08.896 --> 22:10.064
Swallow it.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.079
Oh.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.147
Let's play!

22:26.247 --> 22:28.549
Oh, is this a drinking game?

22:28.649 --> 22:29.917
What are...
What are the rules?

22:30.017 --> 22:31.219
- Oh.
- Ah!

22:34.454 --> 22:35.923
Oh!

22:42.029 --> 22:43.030
Okay.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.703
You ready to lose
to a celebrity?

22:48.803 --> 22:51.505
Oh, I can't wait to slap
the shit outta you.

22:51.606 --> 22:53.608
Mmm.

22:57.111 --> 22:58.411
Oh! Ah!

22:58.512 --> 23:00.548
Oh, okay. Mmm.

23:00.648 --> 23:02.149
Mmm.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.450
Oh.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.088
Oh!

23:12.360 --> 23:14.328
Audrey...

23:14.427 --> 23:15.696
You and me?
You and me?

23:15.796 --> 23:17.430
-Yeah. Uh...
-Yeah. Let's fucking go!

23:17.531 --> 23:19.600
Yeah, you're evens, okay?
Uh, you got this.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.235
Close this fucking deal.

23:21.335 --> 23:23.004
That's my bitch!

23:29.409 --> 23:31.712
I won? I won! I won, right?

23:31.812 --> 23:32.680
I won!

23:34.548 --> 23:36.317
I won! I won!

23:36.416 --> 23:37.752
Audrey!

23:42.455 --> 23:43.758
Oh, shit.

23:43.858 --> 23:45.960
Audrey! Audrey! Yes!

23:46.060 --> 23:49.330
You just nailed him
like Mike fuckin' Tyson!

23:49.429 --> 23:50.698
I'm so sorry.

23:56.203 --> 23:57.437
Oh, no, you're good.

23:57.538 --> 23:58.539
- Did I hit him?
- Yeah, yeah, he's fine.

23:58.639 --> 24:00.374
Yeah! Yeah!

24:00.473 --> 24:01.542
I'm just gonna... Yeah!

24:06.981 --> 24:09.050
I'm so, so fucked.

24:09.150 --> 24:10.351
No, no, you're good.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.586
Oh, thank God for Kat.
Look at her.

24:12.687 --> 24:15.289
Chunhwa just schmoozing
with those businessmen,

24:15.389 --> 24:16.557
salvaging our night.

24:16.657 --> 24:19.026
God. I love her.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.429
-God, I'm gonna be sick again.
-I'll get you a ginger ale.

24:21.529 --> 24:24.699
Get me a new face or stomach,
or something.

24:24.799 --> 24:26.267
Are you feeling better?
- I'm so sorry.

24:26.367 --> 24:29.370
I... I usually don't, um,
have eggs like that and...

24:29.469 --> 24:30.671
Wait. Uh.

24:31.305 --> 24:32.573
Do you speak English?

24:32.673 --> 24:34.474
Many Chinese people
speak English.

24:34.575 --> 24:38.079
But most Americans
do not speak Chinese.

24:38.179 --> 24:39.814
It's always fun to pretend.

24:39.914 --> 24:42.616
By the way, I appreciate that
you would want to smash this.

24:42.717 --> 24:45.886
Oh. Well, I would.
I'd smash it really...

24:45.987 --> 24:48.289
I can see it's your first time
in China.

24:48.389 --> 24:49.824
Yeah. You know what? I'm...

24:49.924 --> 24:51.993
I'm usually not like this.
I'm... I'm so sorry, I got sick.

24:52.093 --> 24:54.795
But I'm... I'm very ready
to go over the terms

24:54.895 --> 24:56.063
of our business proposal.

24:56.163 --> 24:58.065
You know,
there's a saying in Chinese.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.606
It means,
you can tell a lot
about a person

25:05.706 --> 25:06.807
by their family.

25:06.907 --> 25:08.809
Do you have any relatives
in China?

25:08.909 --> 25:10.444
Oh, uh, yeah, well, probably.

25:10.544 --> 25:13.547
Uh, sure, yes.
Definitely, probably.

25:13.647 --> 25:15.182
Um, I... I was adopted, so...

25:15.282 --> 25:18.252
Oh, well, if you do not know
where you come from,

25:18.352 --> 25:19.687
how do you know who you are?

25:19.787 --> 25:21.989
Oh, God. No, no,
I know where I'm from.

25:22.089 --> 25:23.991
Actually, you know, I was
born here, but I am American.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.260
So, you have no contact
with your Chinese family.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.596
That's a shame.

25:30.998 --> 25:33.634
Uh...
What? What'd he say?

25:33.734 --> 25:37.571
Well, she's actually really
close with her birth mother.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.842
- Yeah. Like that.
- Oh.

25:41.942 --> 25:43.711
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:43.811 --> 25:45.046
We're actually meeting up
with her this week.

25:46.113 --> 25:47.415
My mother is celebrating

25:47.516 --> 25:48.783
her 70th birthday this Friday.

25:48.883 --> 25:50.618
-Oh, wow.
-It's gonna be a big event.

25:50.718 --> 25:52.720
Her favorite performer's
gonna be there. DJ Tiesto.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.623
We're gonna have gift bags,
oranges, Teslas,

25:55.723 --> 25:57.526
Bitcoin, that kinda thing.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.361
I would love for you to come.
Bring your mother.

26:00.461 --> 26:02.129
My mother? Um, no... Oh...

26:02.229 --> 26:04.065
Oh, you know what,
uh, we couldn't impose.

26:04.165 --> 26:06.600
-No, no, I insist.
-You insist. He insists.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.070
-Oh, yeah. This one.
-How are we supposed
to do business together

26:09.170 --> 26:10.905
if we do not know
each other's families?

26:11.005 --> 26:12.306
We can't do business
if we don't...

26:12.406 --> 26:14.742
Come to the event,
and we'll close the deal there.

26:14.842 --> 26:17.078
Oh, yeah.

26:20.314 --> 26:21.816
Oh. Finally.

26:21.916 --> 26:23.484
We'll be there.
It's... It's a mom party.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.686
So, it's settled then.

26:25.786 --> 26:28.322
I... Just give me a minute.

26:29.623 --> 26:30.891
Hell yeah,
I'm not okay.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.593
I can't feel my face.

26:32.693 --> 26:34.595
Oh, fuck.

26:34.695 --> 26:36.730
Fuck. That went
so fucking terribly.

26:36.831 --> 26:38.732
Not to me. Uh, I feel closer
to you than ever.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.234
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:40.334 --> 26:42.203
Uh, no, no, no. I'm good.
I'm good. Deadeye, I'm so...

26:42.303 --> 26:44.738
I'm so sorry again that
I threw up on you. We got...

26:44.839 --> 26:45.906
We better clean you up.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.708
Okay, I... I'll find something.

26:49.743 --> 26:51.278
See, I knew
this was gonna happen

26:51.378 --> 26:52.913
if I brought you on
this business trip, Lolo.

26:53.013 --> 26:54.348
You're always doing
shit like this.

26:54.448 --> 26:55.916
What about a "thank you?"

26:56.016 --> 26:57.952
I mean, you were
sinking in there,
and I saved your ass.

26:58.052 --> 26:59.687
Well, whatever you were doing,
you failed.

26:59.787 --> 27:01.255
This is my job.

27:01.355 --> 27:03.290
Why would you lie and tell
Chao that I knew my birth mom?

27:03.390 --> 27:04.792
-That's insane.
-That is insane.

27:04.892 --> 27:07.394
Are you her echo? Who the fuck
asked for your opinion?

27:07.495 --> 27:08.829
Well, what do you expect
her to do now?

27:08.929 --> 27:10.865
She could go find
her birth mom.

27:10.965 --> 27:11.932
Just like we always said
we would.

27:12.032 --> 27:13.067
That was hypothetical.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.569
We don't even know
where she is.

27:14.668 --> 27:15.836
What, you want me to search
all of China?

27:15.936 --> 27:17.271
Give it to me!

27:18.839 --> 27:20.708
-Great.
-So, the other day,

27:20.808 --> 27:22.676
I may have called
the adoption agency

27:22.776 --> 27:23.911
and pretended to be you.

27:24.011 --> 27:25.813
- What are you talking about?
- Wow!

27:25.913 --> 27:27.481
Apparently,
at the time of adoption

27:27.582 --> 27:28.883
she agreed to be contacted.

27:28.983 --> 27:30.217
She's open to meeting you.

27:31.218 --> 27:33.420
Her address is on there.
She lives in Haiching,

27:33.522 --> 27:34.722
which is super close
to Nai Nai's.

27:34.822 --> 27:36.157
And we'll just stay with them.

27:36.257 --> 27:38.692
Oh, no, no, no.
She can't handle it!

27:38.792 --> 27:40.027
Wait, no. Why not?
I can handle it.

27:40.127 --> 27:42.029
Nai Nai's like,
Chinese-Chinese.

27:42.129 --> 27:44.165
Like, "super long hair
coming out of a mole

27:44.265 --> 27:46.433
"and refuses to pluck it
'cause it's bad luck" Chinese.

27:46.535 --> 27:47.835
"Forces you to overeat,

27:47.935 --> 27:49.470
"and then comments
on your weight later" Chinese.

27:49.571 --> 27:51.672
Like, literally,
"take her bra off,
wipe her under-boob sweat

27:51.772 --> 27:52.873
"in the middle of
a Buddhist temple

27:52.973 --> 27:54.375
"and make you sniff it" Chinese.

27:54.475 --> 27:56.511
"Has a plastic bag full of
other plastic bags" Chinese.

27:56.611 --> 27:58.012
Don't act like
you know my family.

27:58.112 --> 28:00.214
You don't know
what we've been through.
Look at Deadeye!

28:00.314 --> 28:02.149
Look at me! Look at me!

28:02.249 --> 28:04.685
It'll be fine.
We'll take the train and...

28:04.785 --> 28:06.220
And go straight to Haiching

28:06.320 --> 28:07.488
and we'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

28:07.589 --> 28:08.889
And I'm gonna close this deal.

28:08.989 --> 28:11.058
And it'd be really nice
to meet your birth mother.

28:12.426 --> 28:13.827
Okay.

28:15.196 --> 28:16.463
Okay, will you guys
come with me?

28:16.565 --> 28:17.865
Fuck yes, bitch.

28:17.965 --> 28:19.733
-I'm here for you, Audrey.
-Oh, my God, thank you.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.636
- Really?
- I love a grand adventure.

28:21.735 --> 28:23.804
Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

28:23.904 --> 28:25.272
Okay, so were gonna go
to Haiching.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.508
Okay, all right. Yeah,
we're doin' it. We're doin' it.

28:26.608 --> 28:27.576
-Haiching, baby!
-Yes!

28:29.410 --> 28:31.345
Guys, guys, I'm a boy.

28:41.088 --> 28:42.156
Just so you guys know,

28:42.256 --> 28:45.159
I have extra cash
in my money belt.

28:45.259 --> 28:46.727
And also, our passports
are in there too.

28:46.827 --> 28:48.429
- Why are you being paranoid?
- Don't worry.

28:48.530 --> 28:50.831
I've got locks on my bag.
Just put it in here.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.399
-Really?
-Of course.

28:52.499 --> 28:53.801
Okay. Make sure your
bags are zipped at all times.

28:53.901 --> 28:55.302
See? Zip it. Zip it. Zip it.

28:55.402 --> 28:57.438
We're in China.
It's the safest place
in the world.

28:57.539 --> 28:58.906
I heard that if you're short,

28:59.006 --> 29:00.609
you'll get kidnapped to go
live on a gymnastics farm.

29:00.709 --> 29:02.009
That's not a thing.

29:02.109 --> 29:03.511
All I'm saying is
that as foreigners,

29:03.612 --> 29:05.079
we need to be extra vigilant,
okay?

29:05.179 --> 29:06.814
Just keep our heads on
a swivel. And watch what

29:06.914 --> 29:08.516
-we eat and what we drink.
-Ooh, good call.

29:08.617 --> 29:10.518
-Let's get some snacks.
-Nom, nom, nom.

29:10.619 --> 29:12.019
-Squid on a stick.
-Okay.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.655
Just come back here, okay?

29:13.787 --> 29:15.089
- We have eight minutes.
- Okay, guess what?

29:15.189 --> 29:17.559
Remember when I told you
I auditioned for that movie?

29:17.659 --> 29:18.727
<i>Sweet Home Orange County?</i>

29:18.826 --> 29:20.662
-Well, I got the part.
-You what?

29:20.761 --> 29:22.564
I'm gonna be in LA next summer.

29:22.664 --> 29:23.931
Oh, congratulations.

29:24.031 --> 29:25.466
Isn't there a chance
you're gonna be in LA too?

29:25.567 --> 29:26.534
Yeah.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.302
-Hotties in La La Land!
-See,

29:28.402 --> 29:30.404
this is why I have to close
this deal and make partner.

29:30.505 --> 29:31.740
It's gonna be so amazing

29:31.839 --> 29:33.608
to have a friend there.
I mean, you really...

29:33.708 --> 29:34.775
You really know me.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.043
-Yeah, I know.
-You've seen a lot.

29:36.143 --> 29:37.311
I've seen a little too much.

29:41.982 --> 29:44.151
Do you think it's okay that
I haven't told Clarence

29:44.251 --> 29:45.553
everything about
my past and...

29:45.654 --> 29:47.955
Yeah, no, it's totally okay.

29:48.055 --> 29:49.624
I mean, hey, can you...

29:49.724 --> 29:50.924
-Okay.
-...not mention LA to Lolo?

29:51.025 --> 29:52.459
I haven't really told her
about it yet.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.927
Is there an issue there?

29:54.028 --> 29:55.530
Yeah, no, I mean,
I'll tell her eventually.

29:55.630 --> 29:58.299
But, uh, you know, she doesn't
have as much going on as I do.

30:01.001 --> 30:01.969
And I,
I just think it might be

30:02.069 --> 30:03.571
great to have some space.

30:03.672 --> 30:05.806
I get it.

30:06.508 --> 30:07.642
It's between you and me.

30:07.742 --> 30:09.511
-Thank you. Zip.
-Zip.

30:10.444 --> 30:11.278
Where do we sit?

30:11.378 --> 30:13.380
Find any car
with open seats.

30:16.950 --> 30:18.485
Those guys look shady.

30:18.586 --> 30:20.387
- Oh, there's room here.
- I'm not really...

30:20.487 --> 30:21.822
We'd have to squeeze.

30:21.922 --> 30:23.857
I hate the smell of oranges.

30:25.459 --> 30:28.228
Oh, hi, um, is anyone else
sitting here with you?

30:29.764 --> 30:32.333
No. Sorry. No.
They're not sitting here.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.635
Oh, amazing. Hey, guys!

30:33.735 --> 30:35.603
Guys, guys, come on.
I found one.

30:36.805 --> 30:39.406
It's so nice
to see an American.

30:39.507 --> 30:40.675
Where are you visiting from?

30:40.775 --> 30:42.943
Oh, um,
I actually live in Beijing.

30:43.043 --> 30:44.612
No way. She lives here.

30:44.713 --> 30:45.846
Yeah.
I moved here, like,

30:45.946 --> 30:46.947
I wanna say, five years ago.
I love it.

30:47.047 --> 30:49.049
Also, looking like me here

30:49.149 --> 30:50.951
-I get so much attention.
-Totally.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.152
Asian people with me,

30:52.252 --> 30:53.822
it's just... They've...
I... I'm Gisele.

30:53.954 --> 30:55.055
Yeah.
So, you like living here?

30:55.155 --> 30:56.857
I love it.
The people are great,

30:56.957 --> 30:58.292
the food's incredible.
And it's safe.

30:58.392 --> 31:01.161
Is it safe?
Because, I... I mean,

31:01.261 --> 31:03.197
I just, I hear there's a lot
of pickpockets here, right?

31:03.297 --> 31:05.933
And Chinese youths
are getting really into drugs.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.334
Fuck yeah, they are.

31:07.434 --> 31:08.902
Chinese kids
are cool as fuck.

31:09.002 --> 31:10.270
They fucking party.

31:10.371 --> 31:11.706
You can get anything
you want here.

31:11.806 --> 31:14.108
I... It's...
It's so unbelievable.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.577
I mean, anything you want.

31:15.677 --> 31:16.977
China White, benzos,
bush, kush.

31:17.077 --> 31:18.680
Uh, just curious,
what do you do for work?

31:18.780 --> 31:19.748
-Hmm?
-Mmm?

31:19.848 --> 31:21.482
Oh, I do import. I do import

31:21.583 --> 31:23.752
-and then I... I also do export.
-That's so cool.

31:23.852 --> 31:25.319
So like, like furniture?

31:25.419 --> 31:26.588
Sure.

31:26.688 --> 31:29.089
I have my period.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

31:29.189 --> 31:31.559
Oh, shit.
I'm bleeding.

31:32.794 --> 31:34.061
Fuck.

31:34.161 --> 31:35.764
-Oh, my God. She's so sweet!
-Are you serious?

31:35.864 --> 31:38.031
-That bitch is so suspicious.
-What are you talking about?

31:38.132 --> 31:40.401
-She's super nice.
-Okay, I know you chose her

31:40.501 --> 31:43.505
because she's American
varsity blue corn-fed bitch,

31:43.605 --> 31:44.773
but, like, no!

31:44.873 --> 31:46.306
No, she's totally sus!
There's something

31:46.407 --> 31:47.975
-wrong with her.
-Yeah, you're not my favorite,

31:48.075 --> 31:49.209
- but I do agree.
- Shit! Fuck!

31:49.309 --> 31:50.477
-Hey, are you...
-Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

31:50.578 --> 31:51.780
Are you okay?

31:51.880 --> 31:53.013
Pox is gonna kill me.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.516
- I know it's hot in here.
- Fuck!

31:54.616 --> 31:55.949
-You can't open that window.
-What are you looking at?

31:56.049 --> 31:57.351
There's nothing
to fucking see here.

31:57.451 --> 31:58.986
Don't look at me like that.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.622
What is that?

32:04.958 --> 32:06.460
It's the cops.
They're doing a bag check.

32:06.561 --> 32:08.095
Um, yeah, there's a drug
dealer on the train.

32:08.195 --> 32:10.532
-Oh, fuck!
-Who do we think it is?

32:10.632 --> 32:11.900
The family with the oranges?

32:11.999 --> 32:14.968
Audrey, get a fucking grip!
It's this bitch.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.370
Oh, my God!
You're a drug dealer?

32:16.470 --> 32:18.138
Of course, I am. I was trying
to sell you drugs.

32:18.238 --> 32:19.541
Okay, you need
to get rid of that now.

32:19.641 --> 32:21.041
Get rid of it.

32:21.141 --> 32:22.476
We need to get rid of that.
'Cause if I'm going down,

32:22.577 --> 32:24.244
you little dipshits
are going down with me.

32:24.344 --> 32:25.780
We're American. They're gonna
come after all of us.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.948
If the cops ask, we'll just
say we have nothing to do

32:28.048 --> 32:29.049
with her.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.119
You're drug dealers now,
bitches!

32:32.219 --> 32:33.287
What the fuck?

32:33.387 --> 32:35.122
Okay, that is good shit,
by the way.

32:35.222 --> 32:36.390
Yeah, I only sell the best.

32:37.958 --> 32:39.193
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

32:39.293 --> 32:40.461
- No, no, no.
- Oh, shit.

32:40.562 --> 32:42.095
We can't get caught
with drugs in China.

32:42.196 --> 32:43.798
We'll get deported.
Or jail, probably for life.

32:43.898 --> 32:45.767
Oh, my God, is this what
happened in <i>Brokedown Palace?</i>

32:45.867 --> 32:46.935
That was Thailand!

32:47.034 --> 32:48.035
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna get disbarred.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.704
I am too famous for jail.

32:49.804 --> 32:51.038
You guys need to
calm the fuck down

32:51.138 --> 32:52.172
and you need to fuckin'
listen to me, okay?

32:52.272 --> 32:53.608
Since that window's
not working,

32:53.708 --> 32:55.075
we have two options.
We hide the drugs in our body,

32:55.175 --> 32:56.945
or we do them, okay?
I need your help.

32:57.044 --> 32:58.145
You look like you've done
a lot of drugs.

32:58.245 --> 32:59.313
-That's correct.
-You look like you've

32:59.413 --> 33:00.515
had a lot of things
in your asshole.

33:00.615 --> 33:02.115
Uh, not a lot of things.
Just one thing.

33:02.216 --> 33:03.450
But maybe different varieties
of that one thing,

33:03.551 --> 33:06.253
um, which is dick. I mean,
no, no!

33:06.353 --> 33:07.689
You don't understand.
Cocaine makes me really horny.

33:07.789 --> 33:09.356
-It could get really weird.
-I know you two aren't

33:09.456 --> 33:11.626
drug people and I know
you're super scared right now

33:11.726 --> 33:13.093
but you're gonna
need to decide.

33:13.193 --> 33:14.394
Are you gonna step up
for your fellow countrywoman?

33:14.495 --> 33:16.330
You gonna plug
or you gonna play?

33:16.430 --> 33:17.364
No. Neither.

33:17.464 --> 33:19.734
Is that a condom?

33:19.834 --> 33:22.604
I'm not ready to have sex!

33:28.275 --> 33:30.545
Fuck! Group project!

33:38.853 --> 33:39.921
Deadeye, get in there.

33:52.534 --> 33:54.034
You know what,
I'll handle this, okay?

33:54.134 --> 33:55.637
I got it. I got it, guys.
I got it, got it.

33:55.737 --> 33:57.170
Attention, Chinese policemen.

33:57.271 --> 33:59.106
Oh, shit.
You're about to get lawyered.

33:59.206 --> 34:00.675
Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi.

34:00.775 --> 34:02.276
I know that you think
that we have drugs,

34:02.376 --> 34:05.245
and we do not have drugs.
In fact, I'm a lawyer.

34:05.345 --> 34:08.282
I'm a lawyer. I'm in fact,
a very good lawyer.

34:08.382 --> 34:09.483
And so I just
want you to know that

34:09.583 --> 34:11.886
we are citizens of Amer...
America.

34:11.985 --> 34:13.588
And that is why
I rest my case.

34:13.688 --> 34:15.723
-Bonk! Bonk!
-Mmm.

34:28.135 --> 34:29.704
- Mmm-mmm.
- Okay?

34:29.804 --> 34:32.072
And she took my suitcase.
She took my suitcase.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.108
Hey! This is mine!

34:36.476 --> 34:37.545
Are you kidding? This is mine.

34:37.645 --> 34:39.947
I've never done
drugs in my life.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.321
Okay, okay. We're good,

34:47.420 --> 34:48.822
we're good, we're good,
we're good. Okay.

34:48.922 --> 34:50.290
Every... Everybody, calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.960
Oh, my God! What the fuck?

34:52.060 --> 34:53.828
That American girl stole
Kat's suitcase.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.495
Our passports are in there.

34:55.597 --> 34:57.331
Well, the bright side is,
we just got
kicked off the train.

34:57.431 --> 34:59.366
We're not hanging by our
nipples in a meat freezer.

34:59.466 --> 35:01.134
No, no, no, no. If we do not
have our passports,

35:01.234 --> 35:02.971
then we can't go home.
And if we can't go home,

35:03.071 --> 35:04.939
then we can't go to our jobs.
And if we don't have jobs,

35:05.039 --> 35:06.507
we can't get more money
to get more coke.

35:06.608 --> 35:09.010
I want more coke. Oh, my God.
Is anyone else itchy?

35:09.109 --> 35:10.410
I'm sorry. I'm just,
I'm fucking itchy.

35:10.511 --> 35:12.179
Fuck. Fuck.
Kat, honey, you good?

35:12.279 --> 35:13.615
-Are they coming out?
-Yeah, but only seven.

35:13.715 --> 35:15.917
-And I think I put in eight.
-If you get a clean one

35:16.017 --> 35:17.250
could you just, um,
keep me posted?

35:17.351 --> 35:19.419
I hate you so much right now!

35:19.520 --> 35:21.556
Just push. Pull.
I mean, twist it.

35:21.656 --> 35:23.524
It's not a Bop It,
it's my asshole!

35:23.625 --> 35:25.292
Okay, just stick
your hand up there

35:25.392 --> 35:28.062
like a claw machine tryin'
to get the stuffed bear.

35:28.161 --> 35:30.197
-Okay.
-Deeper!

35:30.297 --> 35:31.699
- Okay.
- Higher!

35:31.799 --> 35:33.333
-Okay!
-Get that bear!

35:33.433 --> 35:35.069
I'm getting the bear!

35:35.168 --> 35:36.804
How are you so normal?

35:36.904 --> 35:38.940
You did, like, twice as much
stuff as the rest of us.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.676
I think all the coke and molly
just balanced out my system.

35:41.776 --> 35:43.143
I just feel good.

35:43.243 --> 35:44.344
Like, "just watched a child

35:44.444 --> 35:45.980
"fall through
a manhole cover" good.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.382
You deserve it,
little shit.

35:48.482 --> 35:50.685
You're a beautiful
silk kimono.

35:53.487 --> 35:55.288
Is this a hot dog on a stick?

35:55.389 --> 35:57.091
You know what?
Maybe I just miscounted.

35:57.190 --> 35:58.392
It's probably seven.

36:08.736 --> 36:12.272
Deadeye! If you find coke,
come back!

36:12.372 --> 36:14.441
Guys, how have
we walked for hours

36:14.542 --> 36:16.110
and haven't seen one car?

36:16.209 --> 36:18.579
It's all good.
I DM'd Baron Davis.

36:19.580 --> 36:23.618
Fuck. The next town
is 27 kilometers away.

36:23.718 --> 36:25.653
My basketball boo
is on his way, okay?

36:25.753 --> 36:27.387
Oh. Although, at this point,

36:27.487 --> 36:29.256
I don't even wanna be
rescued, okay?

36:29.356 --> 36:30.992
I cannot be seen in public

36:31.092 --> 36:32.160
looking like this.

36:32.259 --> 36:33.360
Yeah, you look like
Hello Kitty

36:33.460 --> 36:34.996
just got skull-fucked
by Grobie.

36:35.096 --> 36:38.766
Oh, my God,
you're so funny!

36:38.866 --> 36:40.034
Fuck you!

36:40.134 --> 36:42.003
This is all your fault.

36:42.103 --> 36:43.504
How is it my fault?

36:43.604 --> 36:45.673
I'm not the one who
chose the train cabin

36:45.773 --> 36:47.575
with the one
obvious drug dealer

36:47.675 --> 36:50.645
just 'cause I'm a wee bit
racist against my own people.

36:50.745 --> 36:53.181
-I'm not racist.
-Hey, "not racist."

36:53.280 --> 36:54.481
But you don't like boba

36:54.582 --> 36:56.316
and you've never fucked
an Asian guy, so...

36:56.416 --> 36:58.619
-Damn. Still?
-No, no. Remember that

36:58.720 --> 37:01.155
foreign exchange student
from Kazakhstan?

37:01.288 --> 37:02.790
B... Bizi... Bizip? Uh, Bazid?

37:02.890 --> 37:04.792
-David?
-David. David.

37:04.892 --> 37:05.960
Is Kazakhstan even in Asia?

37:06.060 --> 37:07.294
They look kind of
Asian sometimes.

37:07.394 --> 37:09.496
- Oh, my God!
- Okay. Racist.

37:09.597 --> 37:11.933
When I masturbate, I sometimes
fantasize about Splinter.

37:12.033 --> 37:13.101
-He's Asian.
-He's a rat.

37:13.201 --> 37:14.736
He's a good father.

37:14.836 --> 37:17.739
Fine. Fine. I'm sorry, okay?
It's my fault.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.208
Oh, my God.

37:20.307 --> 37:21.843
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

37:22.910 --> 37:23.945
My phone is dead.

37:24.045 --> 37:25.479
We don't have
any food or water.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.715
God. I should have
never come to China.

37:27.815 --> 37:29.249
Wait, there's someone
on the road.

37:29.349 --> 37:31.152
No, there isn't.
You're probably hallucinating.

37:31.251 --> 37:33.187
Okay, maybe because
I also see a giraffe

37:33.286 --> 37:34.387
peeling off his spots

37:34.488 --> 37:35.857
and throwing them
like a frisbee.

37:35.957 --> 37:36.924
Oh, shit!

37:37.024 --> 37:38.391
Jeez.

37:38.492 --> 37:39.927
Okay, but that's a bus, right?

37:50.838 --> 37:51.639
Baron.

37:51.739 --> 37:53.440
I knew you would come for me.

37:53.541 --> 37:54.976
<i>Ni hao,</i> Lolo.

37:55.676 --> 37:57.512
I heard y'all needed a ride.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.225
Okay, so the team is going
to give us a ride to Haiching

38:11.324 --> 38:12.392
first thing in the morning.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.294
- And then we can...
- Ooh, ooh.

38:14.394 --> 38:15.797
Oh.

38:25.405 --> 38:27.875
Audrey, are you eye-fucking
an Asian guy?

38:27.975 --> 38:30.278
No. No, no. Don't. No. Lolo,
don't get us in trouble.

38:30.377 --> 38:31.546
We're just, you know, just,

38:31.646 --> 38:33.247
they're our ride,
so let's just be cool.

38:33.346 --> 38:35.917
-Let's be cool.
-I'm cool. I'm very cool.

38:36.017 --> 38:38.686
I'm gonna <i>Jaws</i> the fuck
outta Baron Davis tonight.

38:39.287 --> 38:40.387
Aah. Aah.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.089
-Your mouth is so big.
-Oh, my God.

38:42.190 --> 38:44.926
I know. But, look,
without teeth, not as big.

38:45.993 --> 38:47.494
-Why is mine so tiny?
-I'm all underbite.

38:47.595 --> 38:49.597
Okay. Can everyone
just close our mouths?

38:49.697 --> 38:52.499
Let's just be adults, right?

38:52.600 --> 38:56.436
Okay, they're just
some normal, attractive men.

38:56.537 --> 38:59.874
It's nothing to lose your
minds over. It's...

39:04.011 --> 39:05.546
-You okay?
-Oh, my God.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.348
It was eight coke bags.

39:08.448 --> 39:11.118
It was eight. I just
felt it burst.

39:14.689 --> 39:16.958
Your mouth is
pretty fuckin' big too.

39:17.058 --> 39:19.293
Are you horny? Finger me twice
if you're horny.

39:19.392 --> 39:21.262
Kat?

39:21.361 --> 39:24.031
Oh, shit.
What's up, <i>chica?</i>

39:24.131 --> 39:26.433
Fancy seeing you here.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.870
-I have no idea who you are.
-Wait. Todd?

39:28.970 --> 39:31.505
-What are you doing in China?
-Hey, China!

39:31.606 --> 39:33.274
Oh, man, you know...

39:33.373 --> 39:35.509
I'm just out here
hoopin' professionally.

39:35.610 --> 39:36.911
Why is Kat pretending
like she doesn't know me?

39:37.011 --> 39:38.679
Uh, my name's not Kat.

39:38.779 --> 39:40.114
Yeah, no, that's not Kat.

39:40.214 --> 39:43.284
That's... Hermione.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.786
I'm Ron. This is Harry.

39:46.386 --> 39:47.355
-Hagrid.
-This...

39:47.454 --> 39:48.856
Okay.

39:48.956 --> 39:50.258
Just one sec.

39:50.358 --> 39:52.193
Okay. Yeah.

39:52.293 --> 39:55.462
Hey, not Kat. Um, mmm.

39:55.563 --> 39:57.531
You know, sometimes I just
find myself

39:57.632 --> 39:59.700
thinkin' back to this time
when me and someone who looks

39:59.800 --> 40:02.270
so much like you rode out
to the Grand Canyon

40:02.370 --> 40:05.405
in my Ford F-150
pick-up truck. And then...

40:05.506 --> 40:06.874
You used to bang this dude?

40:07.440 --> 40:08.776
Yeah.

40:08.876 --> 40:10.845
-No. I'm actually engaged now.
-Whoa. Okay.

40:10.945 --> 40:12.412
-So I have a...
-Okay. Yeah. No, that's cool.

40:12.513 --> 40:13.681
- I see that.
- ...fiance.

40:13.781 --> 40:16.017
Yep. That's okay.
Great. Thank you. Wow.

40:16.117 --> 40:19.253
I'm happy for you, Huang.
That's awesome.

40:19.353 --> 40:21.622
Oh, man. Hey.

40:21.722 --> 40:23.124
I'm happy you're puttin' that

40:23.224 --> 40:25.793
big ol' mouth of yours to
good use, huh?

40:25.893 --> 40:27.427
Good seeing you.

40:27.528 --> 40:29.130
- Oh, my God.
- You all have a good night.

40:29.230 --> 40:30.364
-Good seeing ya.
-Yeah, you too.

40:30.463 --> 40:32.432
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:33.067 --> 40:34.635
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

40:34.735 --> 40:36.037
So we know what's
happening tonight.

40:36.137 --> 40:40.074
No, no. I'm not hooking up
with Todd, okay? Okay?

40:40.174 --> 40:42.009
I am not horny at all.

40:42.109 --> 40:46.681
The coke that literally just
exploded inside my butthole

40:46.781 --> 40:49.417
has no effect
on me whatsoever.

40:49.517 --> 40:51.285
Um, I am gonna go now.

40:51.385 --> 40:54.422
Have fun DJing
in between your legs tonight.

40:55.856 --> 40:57.490
Oh, shit.
Baron just texted me.

40:57.591 --> 40:58.726
Okay. Promise me

40:58.826 --> 41:00.294
-you'll have some fun tonight.
-Okay.

41:00.394 --> 41:02.396
All right, hit the bar.
Let loose, okay?

41:02.495 --> 41:03.698
Okay. Great.

41:03.798 --> 41:05.433
Linsanity!

41:05.533 --> 41:07.234
Lin... Oh, Lin-Manuel Miranda?

41:09.503 --> 41:11.038
So much to learn.

41:11.138 --> 41:13.040
Finally, those two
fuckin' losers are gone.

41:13.774 --> 41:15.843
Now it's just two cool cats.

41:15.943 --> 41:17.979
Dynamic duo.
Thelma and Louise.

41:18.079 --> 41:20.414
-We hangin' or what?
-I actually have a lot of...

41:20.514 --> 41:21.716
I gotta do some work.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.951
Yeah. Study buddies.
MVP of group projects.

41:24.051 --> 41:25.586
I actually really need
some alone time.

41:26.253 --> 41:27.722
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:28.189 --> 41:29.489
Um...

41:29.590 --> 41:31.892
No, but you should...
You should have some fun.

41:31.993 --> 41:33.294
-Yeah.
-They seem really nice.

41:33.394 --> 41:34.695
You should go...
Oh, my God. Wait, look.

41:34.795 --> 41:37.131
He has a BTS shirt on.
You should go talk to him.

41:37.231 --> 41:38.232
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:38.332 --> 41:39.333
No.

41:39.433 --> 41:41.268
I... Okay.

41:41.369 --> 41:44.171
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow,
okay? Get some sleep.

41:44.271 --> 41:45.272
Okay. See you.

42:09.063 --> 42:12.199
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I don't speak Chinese.

42:12.299 --> 42:14.235
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:14.335 --> 42:15.836
I'm Kenny. Uh, this is Arvind.

42:15.936 --> 42:17.872
I think he wanted
to buy you a drink.

42:17.972 --> 42:19.974
- But he only speaks Chinese.
- Oh.

42:20.074 --> 42:23.978
And Hindi, which I'm assuming
you don't speak.

42:24.078 --> 42:26.747
Oh, no.
I don't. Sorry, I'm...

42:26.847 --> 42:30.217
I'm just a garbage American
who only speaks English.

42:30.317 --> 42:31.986
And a little Gollum.

42:32.086 --> 42:35.456
"My precious!"

42:35.589 --> 42:37.725
"They are filthy Hobbitses!"

42:38.793 --> 42:41.062
-Do you guys have that here?
-Uh, yeah, we have.

42:41.162 --> 42:43.230
It's all over the world.

42:43.330 --> 42:45.032
-Right.
-Yeah. Um...

43:00.581 --> 43:02.283
Shit.

43:03.617 --> 43:04.852
Hey.

43:05.953 --> 43:07.556
Hello.

43:07.655 --> 43:09.256
It's hot in here, huh?

43:09.356 --> 43:10.357
The AC broken or somethin'?

43:10.458 --> 43:11.826
Oh, my God.

43:11.926 --> 43:14.128
Whoa.

43:16.997 --> 43:18.032
Lolo.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.302
-Baron.
-What's up?

43:21.402 --> 43:24.071
One more round of Yobo, please.

43:24.171 --> 43:27.775
And I know China is supposed
to be my homeland but...

43:28.776 --> 43:30.311
I don't know.
Ever since I got here,

43:30.411 --> 43:31.879
I just, I feel like I'm doing
everything wrong.

43:31.979 --> 43:34.615
Firstly, there is no way
to do Chinese wrong.

43:34.715 --> 43:36.283
- Right.
- But secondly,

43:36.383 --> 43:38.252
what's the one thing
you've been saying the most?

43:38.352 --> 43:40.589
-I don't know.
-"I."

43:40.688 --> 43:43.357
You've been saying,
"I can't eat the food."

43:43.457 --> 43:45.059
"I am doing everything wrong."

43:45.159 --> 43:47.761
It's not about that.
The thing is, in China,

43:47.862 --> 43:50.331
the collective is much bigger
than the individual,

43:50.431 --> 43:52.399
all right?
It's like me and Arvind.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.568
We're not from here.

43:53.667 --> 43:55.604
But now we call this
our home. Right?

43:55.703 --> 43:58.005
See? He teaches me some Hindi,

43:58.105 --> 43:59.473
I taught him
how to fuck spiders.

43:59.574 --> 44:00.609
What?

44:00.708 --> 44:01.942
-It's an Australian thing.
-Huh?

44:02.042 --> 44:03.777
But you just gotta
give it some time

44:03.878 --> 44:05.412
and find your people.

44:05.514 --> 44:08.082
That was really insightful.

44:11.685 --> 44:12.853
Wait.

44:12.953 --> 44:14.355
You and this Clarence dude
have been dating

44:14.455 --> 44:15.689
for over three years

44:15.789 --> 44:17.825
and never had sex?

44:19.894 --> 44:21.762
Kat Huang I knew in college
couldn't last three days.

44:21.862 --> 44:23.964
That is all in the past.

44:24.765 --> 44:26.767
I am different now.

44:26.867 --> 44:29.670
Katherine Huang has got
her shit together.

44:29.770 --> 44:31.105
I get it.

44:31.205 --> 44:33.841
I was bangin' so many random
girls after every game.

44:33.941 --> 44:36.578
So many.

44:36.677 --> 44:37.745
And I just thought to myself,

44:37.845 --> 44:38.879
"Man, you gotta cut
this shit out."

44:38.979 --> 44:40.881
Like...

44:40.981 --> 44:42.249
...I gotta get serious

44:42.349 --> 44:43.717
if I'm ever gonna find
a real one, you know?

44:43.817 --> 44:46.253
Kinda like what you
and Clarice have.

44:46.353 --> 44:48.789
His name is actually,
uh, Clarence but...

44:48.889 --> 44:50.724
Oh! Ow!

44:50.824 --> 44:52.126
-Fuck!
-Are you okay?

44:52.226 --> 44:53.761
Uh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine.

44:53.861 --> 44:56.030
I probably just, uh...
Uh, just pulled something.

44:56.130 --> 44:57.599
Let's get you off. Come on.
Hop up. Hop up.

44:58.832 --> 45:00.134
Breathe. Breathe.
Come on. Up, up.

45:00.234 --> 45:01.869
Yeah. Okay.
You're doin' great.

45:01.969 --> 45:04.405
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh. Okay.

45:04.506 --> 45:05.806
Okay.

45:05.906 --> 45:07.441
I actually have something
that might help.

45:07.542 --> 45:08.976
Okay.

45:10.244 --> 45:11.378
Okay.

45:11.478 --> 45:12.446
May I?

45:13.314 --> 45:14.315
Uh...

45:18.752 --> 45:20.321
Yeah.

45:20.421 --> 45:21.989
This is what
I've been working on.

45:22.089 --> 45:23.757
You're such a great artist.

45:23.857 --> 45:25.125
How do you come up
with this stuff?

45:25.226 --> 45:27.596
I just want people
to be more body positive.

45:27.696 --> 45:29.496
You know, sex isn't shameful.

45:29.598 --> 45:31.832
It's beautiful.
Like, the noises?

45:31.932 --> 45:33.334
- Yeah.
- Come on.

45:45.346 --> 45:47.682
-I'm into that shit too.
-Look, at first,

45:47.781 --> 45:50.884
I know my art seems like
it's for shock value.

45:50.985 --> 45:52.286
-But...
-Mmm-hmm.

45:52.386 --> 45:54.288
...I'm just tryin' to get
the conversation going.

45:58.859 --> 46:00.361
He says he really likes you.

46:00.461 --> 46:01.929
Well, I like him too.

46:02.463 --> 46:03.665
I like both of you.

46:03.764 --> 46:05.266
God, I wish there were
more of you guys

46:05.366 --> 46:06.433
when I was growing up.

46:06.534 --> 46:09.136
Maybe I would've had
an Asian boyfriend by now.

46:09.236 --> 46:10.771
Or two.

46:20.515 --> 46:22.149
God, that's so hot.

46:22.249 --> 46:24.885
He said he wants to
make you scream.

46:26.854 --> 46:28.289
Will you tell him I love that

46:29.557 --> 46:31.992
but maybe it'd be better
if his friend joined in.

46:35.563 --> 46:37.565
Tongue. Lips.

46:37.666 --> 46:39.233
Tongue. Faster.

46:39.333 --> 46:41.235
Breathe with me.

46:43.705 --> 46:44.773
You feelin' that?

46:44.872 --> 46:46.508
Ah!

46:47.241 --> 46:48.242
Let it in.

46:57.117 --> 46:58.485
Do you like hair pulling?

46:58.586 --> 46:59.820
I love it.

46:59.920 --> 47:01.088
Yeah, you like that?

47:01.188 --> 47:02.256
No!

47:02.356 --> 47:04.726
-Now give me the basketball.
-What?

47:04.825 --> 47:06.360
Just give it to me!

47:22.644 --> 47:23.844
<i>Audrey,</i>
<i>I just heard you haven't</i>

47:23.944 --> 47:25.245
<i>closed the ChinaWave deal.</i>

47:25.346 --> 47:26.880
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.982
- Hi, Frank.
- Who the fuck is Frank?

47:29.083 --> 47:31.018
Yeah, no,
it's as good as done.

47:31.118 --> 47:32.620
Um, I just need until Friday
to make it official.

47:32.721 --> 47:35.089
<i>Okay, we're not payin' you</i>
<i>to be on vacation out there.</i>

47:35.189 --> 47:38.125
Don't worry. I'm very...
Very close.

47:38.225 --> 47:40.060
<i>Hell yeah, you are.</i>
<i>You're about to finish,</i>

47:40.160 --> 47:42.262
<i>so just keep grinding.</i>
<i>Bend over backwards</i>

47:42.363 --> 47:44.098
<i>-if you have to.</i>
<i>-Yeah,</i> okay. Okay.

47:56.511 --> 47:59.279
-Whoa.
-I want you to feel this too.

48:02.483 --> 48:03.685
Ah!

48:12.259 --> 48:14.328
- Sugar, anyone?
- I'll have some.

48:15.462 --> 48:16.897
One lump or two lumps?

48:16.997 --> 48:19.166
Two.

48:19.266 --> 48:21.201
Oop.

48:21.301 --> 48:22.737
So, how was everyone's night?

48:22.837 --> 48:24.204
-Restful. I feel rested.
-Mmm-hmm.

48:24.304 --> 48:25.707
The beds are comfortable here.

48:25.807 --> 48:28.075
Lolo!
What the fuck happened?

48:30.177 --> 48:32.946
Jiaying, torn hamstring.

48:33.615 --> 48:37.017
Arvind, Ken, concussions.

48:37.951 --> 48:41.054
Todd, shattered
fucking pelvis!

48:41.155 --> 48:44.324
Hello, kitty Kat.

48:44.425 --> 48:47.094
You and your girls
destroyed our team.

48:47.194 --> 48:49.731
Now I have to go
play the game by myself.

48:49.831 --> 48:51.432
Get y'all ass on the bus.

48:54.836 --> 48:56.136
Sorry.

48:59.139 --> 49:02.009
Wait, you were supposed to be
our ride, remember?

49:02.109 --> 49:03.745
-Oh, shit.
-What are we gonna do?

49:03.845 --> 49:06.046
You know what?
We've gotten this far.

49:06.714 --> 49:07.682
We'll figure it out.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.907
You think
she's gonna fuck him too?

49:33.006 --> 49:34.241
Oh, yeah.

49:42.349 --> 49:44.953
It is
so beautiful here.

49:45.052 --> 49:46.788
I love China.

49:46.888 --> 49:48.055
Do you hear me?

49:48.155 --> 49:49.524
<i>Wo ai</i> China.

49:49.624 --> 49:51.826
Should we tell her that
there's a bug on her jacket?

49:51.926 --> 49:54.261
Mmm-mmm.

50:04.438 --> 50:06.106
How old is our driver?

50:06.206 --> 50:09.409
Twelve, counting
the Chinese way. So 11.

50:09.511 --> 50:12.246
I don't understand,
but I love it!

50:16.250 --> 50:17.785
<i>So you're sure</i>
<i>it's okay for us</i>

50:17.886 --> 50:19.219
<i>to stay at your</i>
<i>grandma's house?</i>

50:19.319 --> 50:21.923
Of course. But just know
that they're a lot.

51:05.365 --> 51:06.668
Very good.

51:06.768 --> 51:08.168
Okay. Wait.

51:08.268 --> 51:09.236
-What, what's he saying?
-They think

51:09.336 --> 51:10.805
you're very beautiful.

51:10.905 --> 51:12.439
And any mother, uh,

51:12.540 --> 51:14.241
would be lucky
to have you as a daughter.

51:16.209 --> 51:17.579
Thank... Thank you.

51:17.679 --> 51:18.880
Uh, <i>Xie... Xiexie.</i>

51:18.980 --> 51:22.316
Oh, have some
chocolate. This a favorite.

51:22.416 --> 51:24.919
This is the chocolate of
"Chinese" Chinese people.

51:25.019 --> 51:26.320
Shit. This means
she likes you.

51:26.420 --> 51:28.022
If you see Russell Stover,
you're fucked.

51:28.121 --> 51:30.324
Okay.

51:30.424 --> 51:34.194
In this house, you are family.

51:34.294 --> 51:36.831
<i>Ganbei!</i>

51:49.544 --> 51:50.845
Whoa. Okay.

51:57.384 --> 51:58.653
So, is this a Chinese card game?

51:58.753 --> 52:00.521
No, I just made it up
to win their money.

52:00.622 --> 52:02.222
I tell them
it's an American game.

52:04.759 --> 52:05.760
Ah?

52:07.829 --> 52:09.564
Hey, Deadeye.

52:09.664 --> 52:11.198
Why you so grumpy?

52:11.298 --> 52:13.534
You should smile more.

52:14.167 --> 52:16.336
-Like Audrey.
-Oh.

52:23.578 --> 52:25.880
It's nice that you have
such a big family.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.649
I'm not really like my family.

52:27.749 --> 52:29.817
Well, you and me, both.

52:29.917 --> 52:31.418
Really?

52:31.519 --> 52:34.022
I feel like you and your
parents are kinda the same.

52:34.122 --> 52:35.590
I mean, you're basically white.
No offense.

52:35.690 --> 52:39.727
I'm Chinese, I'm not white.

52:39.827 --> 52:43.097
I'm sorry.
I say so many stupid things.

52:43.196 --> 52:44.264
That's why my family thinks

52:44.364 --> 52:46.233
I'm socially awkward
and too weird.

52:46.333 --> 52:47.568
You think I am too.

52:49.537 --> 52:51.338
-No, I don't.
-I heard you in the airport.

52:51.438 --> 52:52.707
No, I, I didn't mean that. It...

52:52.807 --> 52:53.808
It... It's okay.

52:55.143 --> 52:56.443
I'm used to it.

53:02.215 --> 53:03.551
You know why I like K-pop?

53:03.651 --> 53:04.719
No. Why?

53:05.953 --> 53:07.320
Because it likes me back.

53:07.421 --> 53:09.456
Yeah, it's not
just awesome songs,

53:09.557 --> 53:12.894
it's about what we created
because we love the music.

53:12.994 --> 53:14.227
It's about us.

53:14.327 --> 53:15.530
I've never thought
about it that way.

53:15.630 --> 53:18.432
-The... The community.
-But it's not real.

53:18.533 --> 53:20.068
I haven't met any of them.

53:20.168 --> 53:23.403
I just talk to them online.
I don't have any real friends.

53:23.504 --> 53:26.140
-Well, we're friends.
-Really?

53:26.239 --> 53:28.509
'Cause we're gonna be home
in a couple of days.

53:28.609 --> 53:30.477
Do you actually think
we're gonna hang out?

53:30.578 --> 53:32.814
-Yeah, we could. Of course.
-I don't know.

53:32.914 --> 53:35.215
Everyone likes you. You're cool.

53:35.315 --> 53:37.284
Your hair smells
like a cookie.

53:38.653 --> 53:40.220
Your life is perfect.

53:41.055 --> 53:42.255
Well, it's not.

53:43.725 --> 53:45.860
But sometimes
even I feel like...

53:46.928 --> 53:49.831
You... You know,
I don't really belong either.

53:50.832 --> 53:51.933
You know?

53:58.371 --> 54:01.441
So, so what kind of music
do you like to listen to?

54:01.542 --> 54:03.443
I mean, I love Mumford & Sons.

54:04.145 --> 54:06.313
Uh, The National.

54:06.413 --> 54:08.315
-Maroon Five. The best.
-Yes.

54:08.415 --> 54:10.450
-T Swift is my...
-Uh-huh.

54:12.252 --> 54:13.386
I've really been
liking Cardi B.

54:13.487 --> 54:15.523
-I love Cardi B.
-Oh, cool.

54:15.623 --> 54:19.026
Yeah. You know, K-pop owes
so much to hip-hop.

54:21.863 --> 54:23.064
Suck it, Bao Bao!

54:23.164 --> 54:25.465
Bao Bao!

54:33.641 --> 54:35.810
-You in that thing yet?
-Almost.

54:35.910 --> 54:37.712
It's nice of Nai Nai
to let me borrow this.

54:37.812 --> 54:39.714
Yeah. You're lucky
she likes you.

54:39.814 --> 54:42.617
-She doesn't like anyone.
-Well, I like her, too.

54:42.717 --> 54:44.351
I like your whole family, Lo.

54:44.451 --> 54:46.486
It's funny, all night
I kept thinking about

54:46.587 --> 54:48.523
what it'd be like
if I'd grown up here.

54:48.623 --> 54:50.191
-Mmm.
-I'd be like everyone else,

54:50.323 --> 54:51.626
you know?

54:51.726 --> 54:54.228
People wouldn't stare at me
at the grocery store.

54:54.327 --> 54:56.463
Or ask my parents
where they got me from.

54:58.666 --> 55:02.770
I wouldn't always
just be the Asian girl.

55:02.870 --> 55:06.406
You know, I could,
I could be the smart girl.

55:06.507 --> 55:09.844
Or... or the nice, funny girl.

55:09.944 --> 55:12.580
I wonder if I'd still feel
like I had to be perfect

55:12.680 --> 55:14.682
all the time just to belong.

55:14.782 --> 55:17.285
I don't know. Maybe my whole
life would be different.

55:17.384 --> 55:19.086
I don't think it'd be
that much different.

55:22.723 --> 55:24.091
Wow, bitch.

55:24.192 --> 55:25.927
It's nice, right?

55:26.027 --> 55:27.929
China looks good on you.

55:28.029 --> 55:29.564
I kind of love it.

55:30.430 --> 55:32.399
-Hey, thanks.
-For what?

55:32.499 --> 55:35.036
I'm so grateful that
you pushed me to do this.

55:36.838 --> 55:39.040
I don't think I could have
done it without you.

55:39.140 --> 55:40.741
I got you.

55:42.342 --> 55:45.313
Ooh. Wow!

55:45.412 --> 55:49.717
You look gorgeous.

55:49.817 --> 55:52.352
You know,
I wore that dress the night

55:52.452 --> 55:57.024
I was deflowered
by the love of my life.

55:57.124 --> 55:59.093
-Aw. Grandpa?
-No.

55:59.193 --> 56:00.427
Oh.

56:10.037 --> 56:11.038
That's it.

56:14.075 --> 56:15.408
You ready?

56:17.111 --> 56:18.112
Okay.

56:19.113 --> 56:20.114
Hey!

56:30.591 --> 56:32.593
Oh. Hi. My, my name is Audrey.

56:32.693 --> 56:34.562
I'm... I'm looking
for my mother.

56:35.563 --> 56:37.430
You brought the picture?

56:37.531 --> 56:39.267
Yeah, I just...

56:39.367 --> 56:40.968
thought it would be nice
to have in China.

56:59.387 --> 57:00.354
She knew you.

57:03.591 --> 57:04.859
Does she know my mother?

57:21.409 --> 57:22.543
What is she saying?

57:22.643 --> 57:23.678
Okay, what's, what's going on?

57:23.778 --> 57:25.513
Does she know where my mom is?

57:30.483 --> 57:33.020
You, Korea girl.

57:34.188 --> 57:35.455
Uh...

57:37.224 --> 57:39.260
Your mom's name is Min Park.

57:39.360 --> 57:40.895
That... That's a mistake.

57:40.995 --> 57:42.697
I'm... I'm Chinese.

57:42.797 --> 57:45.266
I... I went to Chinese school
for a year.

57:45.366 --> 57:47.768
I... I... We... We celebrated
Chinese New Year's. I...

57:47.868 --> 57:51.072
But Korea's great. I mean,
there's... There's mukbang,

57:51.172 --> 57:52.472
soju, Hyundai, <i>Gangnam Style,</i>

57:52.573 --> 57:55.076
half of Hines Ward,
half of Charles Melton,

57:55.176 --> 57:56.410
all of Randall Park.

58:09.390 --> 58:11.258
I want my dress back.

58:17.497 --> 58:18.766
Stop being so racist!

58:26.874 --> 58:28.309
My whole life has been wrong.

58:29.477 --> 58:30.778
It hasn't.

58:30.878 --> 58:33.447
We're only friends because
my parents were, like,

58:33.547 --> 58:35.416
"Ooh, another little
Chinese girl."

58:35.516 --> 58:36.784
In everyone's defense,

58:36.884 --> 58:38.519
we were the only
Asian people in town.

58:38.619 --> 58:39.987
So we still
would've been friends.

58:40.087 --> 58:41.822
White people
don't know the difference.

58:41.922 --> 58:43.491
- My parents are white.
So what
if you're Korean?

58:43.591 --> 58:44.925
We all end up in the same place.

58:45.026 --> 58:46.193
Walking around town
with our hands

58:46.293 --> 58:47.628
behind our back, like this.

58:52.733 --> 58:54.935
That's enough.
That's enough.

58:55.036 --> 58:57.304
Fuck this.

58:57.405 --> 58:58.572
I mean...

58:58.672 --> 59:01.642
This whole birth mom
journey is bullshit.

59:05.646 --> 59:06.847
You know what?

59:07.848 --> 59:09.383
I only wanted to find her

59:09.483 --> 59:10.684
to close this
fucking business deal.

59:10.785 --> 59:11.986
I don't actually give a shit

59:12.086 --> 59:15.623
if I'm a Korean lawyer
or a Chinese lawyer

59:15.723 --> 59:18.592
or a fucking German lawyer,
because I'm a lawyer.

59:18.692 --> 59:20.127
And I'm goin' to
finish this job.

59:20.227 --> 59:21.495
This is all a lot, you know?

59:21.595 --> 59:22.730
You don't have to
think about work right now.

59:22.830 --> 59:24.065
This says
she's in Seoul, right?

59:24.165 --> 59:25.666
- That's what you said earlier?
- Uh, yeah.

59:25.766 --> 59:28.836
Okay. So, if we go to
Seoul right now,

59:28.936 --> 59:31.072
I could still find her
and bring her back in time

59:31.172 --> 59:32.873
-to go to Chao's dinner.
-But there are probably, like,

59:32.973 --> 59:34.975
ten thousand Min Parks
in Korea.

59:35.076 --> 59:36.444
Yes, but we have
all of her info right here.

59:36.545 --> 59:38.045
We can hire
a private investigator

59:38.145 --> 59:39.780
-to track her down.
-I'm so in.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.416
Thank you. Thank you, Deadeye.
You're an amazing friend.

59:42.517 --> 59:43.651
Lolo, are you in?

59:43.751 --> 59:45.019
I mean, this is what
you wanted, right?

59:45.119 --> 59:46.454
-I'm in. I'm in, yeah.
-Yes. Thank you.

59:46.555 --> 59:47.788
Thank you. Let's go.

59:47.888 --> 59:49.457
Passports. Passports.
Where are our passports?

59:49.558 --> 59:51.592
Oh, they are in my suitcase
that got stolen.

59:51.692 --> 59:52.960
We don't need fuckin' passports.
Let's go.

59:53.060 --> 59:54.762
Let's think.
No bad ideas. Let's go.

59:54.862 --> 59:56.130
We could flash
our titties and just

59:56.230 --> 59:57.731
-hitchhike the whole way.
-That's a bad idea.

59:57.832 --> 59:59.333
We could take
a rocket to space

59:59.433 --> 01:00:01.368
and then try to land in Korea.
No customs in the atmosphere.

01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:02.603
I feel like that's worse.

01:00:02.703 --> 01:00:04.705
Okay, uh, we become
mail-order brides,

01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:05.973
uh, and then we...
We find a really big envelope

01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:07.341
and then we could just...

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:08.843
I fuckin' love that spirit,
Deadeye.

01:00:08.943 --> 01:00:10.211
-Just keep thinking.
-We take coke again

01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:12.880
- and we just sprint.
- No more coke!

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.482
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
Come on, guys.

01:00:14.583 --> 01:00:15.850
-We could swim there.
-Okay.

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:17.785
Yeah. How, how long can you
hold your breath?

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:20.221
That's it! That's it!
I can't do it anymore!

01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:21.722
Not long enough. Okay, look.
Ready? Ready? Ready?

01:00:21.822 --> 01:00:22.923
You know who can
bypass airport security?

01:00:23.023 --> 01:00:25.826
-The Obamas.
-Yes. And K-pop stars.

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:27.828
We are not K-pop stars.

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:29.130
Not yet, we aren't.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.282
So, are we sure
this is gonna work?

01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:49.884
BTS Army always comes through.

01:00:49.984 --> 01:00:51.986
@Jinderalla88 said
we should be good to go.

01:00:52.086 --> 01:00:54.121
Just act confident.
We're Brownie Tuesday.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:55.089
We're a brand-new group.

01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:56.690
We just did our debut
in Shanghai.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.594
Our first single has
nine million downloads.

01:00:59.693 --> 01:01:00.794
Everyone remember their names?

01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:01.862
-Sassy.
-Cutie.

01:01:01.962 --> 01:01:03.464
-Lisa.
-Lisa "two".

01:01:03.565 --> 01:01:05.666
-We got this.
-We got this.

01:01:05.766 --> 01:01:07.001
Where are your passports?

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:09.803
-We're Brownie Tuesday.
-Yeah. We signed with

01:01:09.904 --> 01:01:12.039
Hit Bang Entertainment
last week. That's our jet.

01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:13.741
Where are your
travel documents?

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:15.876
Do you even know
the name of your booking?

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:18.179
Yeah. Uh, @Jinderalla88.

01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:19.246
Please leave.

01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:21.448
I thought you said
your friend set this up.

01:01:26.588 --> 01:01:27.788
I knew it.

01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:31.458
They're just online friends.
They're not real friends.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.594
No, no. It's okay.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:33.727
We'll figure
something else out.

01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:35.162
No, no.
This always happens to me.

01:01:35.262 --> 01:01:37.331
I make friends,
but they never come through.

01:01:38.899 --> 01:01:41.101
No one wants to be my friend.

01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:45.940
This is all so

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.341
fucking stupid.

01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:52.446
Deadeye, look.

01:01:54.448 --> 01:01:55.449
Deadeye?

01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:57.818
@Jinderalla88?

01:01:57.918 --> 01:02:01.155
Yes, honey. The one and only.

01:02:01.255 --> 01:02:03.324
Okay, slay.

01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:05.459
You'd make V very proud.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.461
I'm pretending
to be your manager.

01:02:07.562 --> 01:02:09.263
We even brought you fans!

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:19.974
Give it up for
Brownie Tuesday!

01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:28.015
Hi.

01:02:28.115 --> 01:02:30.784
Can they get on their jet now?

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:32.654
I don't believe
these girls are singers.

01:02:32.753 --> 01:02:34.021
I can
assure you that these are

01:02:34.121 --> 01:02:35.856
professional idols.
And they've been training

01:02:35.956 --> 01:02:38.292
since they were
14 and 15 years old.

01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:40.027
Girls, show them.

01:02:40.127 --> 01:02:41.596
Um, what, what?

01:02:41.696 --> 01:02:42.664
- Show them what?
- Uh, just show 'em.

01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:43.732
Well, just show them.

01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:45.232
Hello? What are supposed
to show?

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:47.768
You're a fan of Cardi B, right?

01:02:47.868 --> 01:02:49.103
Yeah, but is she here?

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.241
Just pretend that you're back
in the Tootles.

01:02:55.342 --> 01:02:56.443
Trust me.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:03.250
This is gonna be hot.
Livestream this.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:34.975
Ow.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.979
What the fuck is that?

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.015
Oh, my God.

01:04:42.116 --> 01:04:44.184
Nothing. I'm...

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.320
Your pussy's the devil?

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.822
That is way bigger
than I expected.

01:04:47.921 --> 01:04:49.123
No wonder you won't
have sex with Clarence.

01:04:49.223 --> 01:04:50.457
- That thing is massive.
- It's huge.

01:04:50.558 --> 01:04:51.959
The artist did really
impressive work, Kat.

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:53.661
You don't understand.
I've tried lasers,

01:04:53.762 --> 01:04:55.295
I've tried skin grafts and,

01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:57.532
and nothing...
Nothing will take.

01:04:57.632 --> 01:05:00.033
My vagina is the devil.

01:05:00.134 --> 01:05:02.704
And she is here to stay.

01:05:02.804 --> 01:05:04.004
Kat, it's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

01:05:04.104 --> 01:05:07.107
It will not be okay.
It's on the inside too.

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:15.215
Oh, Clar.

01:05:16.049 --> 01:05:18.085
Clarence.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.821
I came for you.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.055
-Wait, no, I can explain.
-No, I...

01:05:24.992 --> 01:05:26.226
Who are you?

01:05:30.197 --> 01:05:31.666
Clarence, no.

01:05:31.766 --> 01:05:32.966
Clarence, no!

01:05:34.702 --> 01:05:36.270
Fuck! What am I gonna do?

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.105
You have caused
a public disturbance!

01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:40.007
And committed
an indecent exposure!

01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:42.042
-We know.
-You must leave. Now!

01:05:48.516 --> 01:05:49.383
Okay.

01:05:49.483 --> 01:05:51.619
Okay. Not to worry.
Not to worry.

01:05:51.719 --> 01:05:52.787
Plan B. Plan B.

01:05:52.887 --> 01:05:54.221
Do you guys have another jet?

01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:08.703
Those chickens have to stop.

01:06:16.143 --> 01:06:18.479
Deadeye, did you just
kill the chicken?

01:06:19.948 --> 01:06:21.649
No.

01:06:47.107 --> 01:06:49.777
Okay, the agency's
right down that way.

01:06:49.878 --> 01:06:50.912
Coffee in
cute bear cups?

01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.212
My treat?

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.750
Oh, finally.
There's good Wi-Fi here.

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:57.150
All my emails are coming in.

01:06:57.251 --> 01:06:59.253
I can see if Clarence
texted me back.

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:04.659
Oh.

01:07:05.927 --> 01:07:07.261
I did...

01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:09.797
Oh, I didn't know I had fans
here. That's kinda nice.

01:07:11.198 --> 01:07:12.667
Wait, they love you here.

01:07:14.234 --> 01:07:17.872
So, um, I think
maybe some people

01:07:17.972 --> 01:07:19.406
picked up my livestream.

01:07:24.913 --> 01:07:26.113
-What?
-It... It's okay.

01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:27.949
I'm sure it's not going viral
or anything.

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:42.296
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I am fucked!

01:07:42.396 --> 01:07:44.498
There's already a meme
with Tweety Bird saying,

01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:46.466
-"I thought I thaw..."
-Don't say it!

01:07:46.568 --> 01:07:48.603
Weird. Chao's calling me.

01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.439
Hi, Chao.
So good to hear from you.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.009
My mother and I were actually
just talking about you.

01:07:55.108 --> 01:07:57.210
-Do not bother coming.
<i>-What?</i>

01:07:57.311 --> 01:07:59.514
I saw the video of you
and your friend's

01:07:59.614 --> 01:08:00.982
-devil vagina.
<i>-Let me explain.</i>

01:08:01.081 --> 01:08:02.249
It's actually, it...
It's so hilarious.

01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:03.918
You're gonna love this story.
It's...

01:08:04.018 --> 01:08:05.319
-Um...
<i>-You lied to me.</i>

01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:06.654
You told me you're in Beijing
with your mother.

01:08:06.754 --> 01:08:08.388
But that's clearly not true.

01:08:08.488 --> 01:08:10.024
I cannot do business
with someone

01:08:10.123 --> 01:08:11.391
who's not who they
say they are.

01:08:11.491 --> 01:08:12.760
Please. Just...
Just hear me out.

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.294
No, I've already
made up my mind.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:16.129
I will tell your boss
that we are not

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:18.098
<i>-going to sign.</i>
-But, when you talk to Frank

01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:19.366
can you please
just not mention

01:08:19.466 --> 01:08:20.500
-the whole video thing?
-I already saw it.

01:08:20.602 --> 01:08:21.903
- Shit!
<i>- I didn't know</i>

01:08:22.002 --> 01:08:23.337
<i>you were this shady, Audrey.</i>

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:25.305
I mean, that is the last time
that I take a chance

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:26.874
on someone like you.

01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:29.408
Again, I mean associate,
not an Asian.

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:31.511
<i>-Anyway, you're fired.</i>
-What?

01:08:31.613 --> 01:08:33.781
Frank. No...
I... I can fix this.

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:35.314
I'm still an ally though.

01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:37.018
I fired a white guy
earlier this week.

01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:38.318
Did the exact same thing.

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:39.621
Okay, Frank. Frank?
Frank, don't hang up.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.523
I'm gonna get fired
from my show.

01:08:42.624 --> 01:08:43.890
And my movie.

01:08:43.992 --> 01:08:46.193
And I'm never gonna go to LA.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.127
It's okay.
It's not the end of the world.

01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:50.698
No, it literally is
the end of the world.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:56.671
Clarence and I were gonna rent
a house in Malibu.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:59.573
And we were gonna be
one of those couples

01:08:59.674 --> 01:09:04.243
who meditate every single day
and tell people about it

01:09:04.344 --> 01:09:08.180
because that is what
people do in Los Angeles.

01:09:08.281 --> 01:09:10.018
It's okay.

01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:13.020
And Audrey was gonna
hang out with us

01:09:13.121 --> 01:09:15.857
all the time when
she moved there.

01:09:19.594 --> 01:09:22.697
Audrey was gonna
move out to LA?

01:09:22.796 --> 01:09:25.899
Once she closed the deal
and got promoted.

01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:30.370
Why didn't you tell me
about LA?

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.273
-Lolo, I can't right now.
-What was your plan?

01:09:33.372 --> 01:09:35.843
Were you just gonna move out
and never say anything?

01:09:35.943 --> 01:09:37.045
It's not happening anymore.

01:09:37.145 --> 01:09:38.310
I just got fired.

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:40.113
- What?
- Chao saw the video.

01:09:40.212 --> 01:09:42.550
-Your video.
-Yeah, well, whatever.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:44.184
Fuck them.
You'll get a new job.

01:09:44.283 --> 01:09:45.720
-It's not that easy.
-For you, it will be.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:47.988
Just go to the country club
where you play squash at.

01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:49.991
I'm pretty sure one of those
white guys will give you a job

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:51.491
-in, like, two seconds.
-What the fuck?

01:09:51.591 --> 01:09:53.861
I worked hard for that job.

01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:56.564
You know what? This is all
your fucking fault.

01:09:56.664 --> 01:09:59.199
Four bears
for four best friends.

01:09:59.299 --> 01:10:00.668
Cappuccino is for Audrey

01:10:00.768 --> 01:10:02.770
because she doesn't like
to try anything weird.

01:10:04.304 --> 01:10:06.406
- She's the best.
- You're a fucking idiot.

01:10:06.507 --> 01:10:08.308
Telling Chao that
I knew my birth mom.

01:10:08.408 --> 01:10:10.812
Dragging us all over
the Chinese countryside.

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:12.013
I was doing this for you.

01:10:12.113 --> 01:10:13.548
No. You were doing it
for yourself.

01:10:13.648 --> 01:10:16.517
You still think we're kids
on some dumb grand adventure.

01:10:16.617 --> 01:10:18.786
Well, grow the fuck up, Lolo.
The rest of us are adults.

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:21.923
You're still a fucking child.
Okay, my life is ruined.

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.059
Your life is ruined?

01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:27.595
My life is ruined, okay?

01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:31.231
You can always find another
fucking desk job, okay?

01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:34.102
I can never find
another Clarence.

01:10:34.202 --> 01:10:35.368
And whose fault is that?

01:10:35.469 --> 01:10:36.838
Maybe you should've
been honest with him

01:10:36.938 --> 01:10:39.107
from the beginning instead of
lying every single day

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:40.407
for the past three years.

01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:41.943
Whoa, what the fuck?
That's her business.

01:10:42.043 --> 01:10:44.311
And since when are you
the spokesperson for honesty?

01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:47.380
Okay, so are... Are you two
best friends now?

01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:48.850
What, like Lilo and Stitch?

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.587
You fuckin' suck
at impressions.

01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:56.124
Go fuck yourself!

01:10:56.224 --> 01:10:57.992
I'll knock
your teeth out, bitch!

01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:04.565
I am an actress.

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:10.303
And even I am less
self-involved than you are.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.674
Huh.

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:17.444
-Kat.
-You know what? Kat's right.

01:11:18.713 --> 01:11:20.214
You've been a shitty friend.

01:11:20.313 --> 01:11:22.315
This entire time,
I was helping you

01:11:22.415 --> 01:11:24.051
so you could get
promoted and leave me?

01:11:24.152 --> 01:11:25.820
-I was doing it for my career.
-Why?

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.622
I mean, you're always talkin'
about how you feel like

01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:29.857
-you don't belong there.
-I don't belong anywhere.

01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.159
I'm clearly not white,

01:11:31.259 --> 01:11:32.660
but you're always
telling me that I am.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.662
And I'm also not Asian enough.
At least not for you.

01:11:34.762 --> 01:11:36.864
That's all in your head!
Your life is perfect!

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:38.199
How is my life perfect

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:40.268
when I spend all my time
babysitting a grown-ass

01:11:40.367 --> 01:11:42.937
-29-year-old woman?
-I'm babysitting you!

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:44.672
I've been saving your ass
since we were kids

01:11:44.772 --> 01:11:46.941
-on the playground.
-You've never, ever

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.242
applied yourself, Lolo.

01:11:48.341 --> 01:11:50.912
You wanna be a real artist?
Then grow up!

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:53.915
Right now, you're just
a barnacle with a cute hobby!

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:58.786
Yo, I may be a barnacle,
but at least I know who I am.

01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:00.822
You know what?

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:03.456
If we didn't grow up

01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:05.927
as the only two
Asian girls in town,

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.796
we never would've
been friends.

01:12:42.864 --> 01:12:46.000
- Sorry.
Thank you so much
for waiting.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.435
We found the record

01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:50.470
-of your birth mother.
-Oh, my gosh.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.543
I... I can't read this. Um...

01:12:56.244 --> 01:12:58.980
So do I call her or...

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.082
I... I'm sorry, I'd...
I don't know how this works.

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.819
I'm so sorry
to tell you that...

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.121
she's passed away.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.159
I have the address
of where she was buried

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.795
if you would like
to visit her.

01:13:15.428 --> 01:13:17.198
No. I'm, uh, um...

01:13:17.298 --> 01:13:18.733
Do you have friend here?

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:21.702
-Someone you can call?
-No. Uh, it's okay. Thank you.

01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:25.673
Thank... Thank, thank you,
thank you so much. Thank you.

01:13:40.388 --> 01:13:41.589
Hi.

01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:42.957
Hi, Dad.

01:14:00.141 --> 01:14:01.474
<i>Hey, it's Clarence.</i>

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:03.577
<i>Jesus loves you.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:14:03.678 --> 01:14:05.713
Uh, hi.

01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:11.152
I know you never wanna talk
to me again, but, um...

01:14:13.654 --> 01:14:15.556
I hope you will listen.

01:14:15.656 --> 01:14:21.295
I wanna be 100% honest
about everything and...

01:14:21.395 --> 01:14:25.967
and, well,
everyone I've ever done.

01:14:28.369 --> 01:14:30.738
I guess we'll start
with the A's.

01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:10.111
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:15:10.211 --> 01:15:11.512
I don't... I don't speak Korean.

01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:12.880
That's okay.

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:14.915
My name's Dae Han.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:16.951
I'm Min Young's husband.

01:15:18.152 --> 01:15:19.253
You must be the daughter.

01:15:22.089 --> 01:15:23.090
Wait. Are...

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.159
Are you my...

01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:26.594
No.

01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:29.230
But I'm glad
to finally meet you.

01:15:30.998 --> 01:15:33.567
We were only married
a few years before
she fell sick.

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:35.302
I'm so sorry.

01:15:37.338 --> 01:15:38.406
They were good years.

01:15:38.507 --> 01:15:40.541
We never had
kids of our own though.

01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:42.343
I'm very sorry
I wasn't able to introduce you

01:15:42.443 --> 01:15:43.744
to a little brother
or sister today.

01:15:43.844 --> 01:15:46.047
It's okay.

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:48.182
She always talked
about you though.

01:15:49.683 --> 01:15:50.751
You know,
she was just a teenager

01:15:50.851 --> 01:15:52.219
when she got pregnant.

01:15:53.687 --> 01:15:56.424
Her boyfriend didn't
want to get in trouble,

01:15:56.525 --> 01:15:57.925
and he denied it.

01:15:58.025 --> 01:16:00.895
So, her parents sent her to
China until you were born.

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:05.066
They're the ones who forced
her to give you up.

01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:07.234
But she never stopped
thinking about you.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:13.207
If I tried to find her sooner

01:16:13.774 --> 01:16:15.709
maybe she and I could...

01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:21.415
But it's too late.

01:16:21.516 --> 01:16:23.017
There's something
you should see.

01:16:24.785 --> 01:16:28.222
When she got sick,
she wanted to throw a party.

01:16:29.623 --> 01:16:31.459
So, we rented a boat

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.028
and we sailed out
to Yeouido Park.

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.430
Uh, that's right along
the Han River.

01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:38.232
Several of us got seasick

01:16:38.332 --> 01:16:39.534
on the way...

01:16:39.633 --> 01:16:41.402
...which she thought
was pretty hilarious.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:46.207
But it was beautiful.

01:16:46.307 --> 01:16:48.776
She got to say goodbye
to everybody she loved.

01:16:51.312 --> 01:16:52.313
Except for you.

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.884
So she made you this.

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:16.203
<i>Hi. I'm Min.</i>

01:17:17.606 --> 01:17:19.707
<i>Sorry, my English is not good.</i>

01:17:19.807 --> 01:17:20.908
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

01:17:21.008 --> 01:17:22.511
<i>Your English is very good.</i>

01:17:24.778 --> 01:17:26.413
<i>I am sorry</i>

01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:29.283
<i>I could not be</i>
<i>part of your life.</i>

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:32.853
<i>I want to very much.</i>

01:17:33.821 --> 01:17:35.456
<i>But when you were baby,</i>

01:17:35.557 --> 01:17:37.958
<i>you smile so big.</i>

01:17:38.058 --> 01:17:41.262
<i>And you cry so big.</i>

01:17:43.063 --> 01:17:47.234
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>you are like now.</i>

01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:50.572
<i>Are you doctor?</i>

01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:52.973
<i>Lawyer? Teacher?</i>

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:58.345
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

01:17:58.445 --> 01:18:00.681
<i>I'm proud to be your mother.</i>

01:18:00.781 --> 01:18:02.016
<i>It doesn't matter?</i>

01:18:02.116 --> 01:18:03.751
<i>That's not what you told me.</i>

01:18:08.022 --> 01:18:12.927
<i>I hope</i>
<i>this message find you.</i>

01:18:14.028 --> 01:18:15.396
<i>And...</i>

01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:27.875
<i>My daughter...</i>

01:18:29.343 --> 01:18:30.344
<i>I love you.</i>

01:18:43.424 --> 01:18:44.491
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.109 --> 01:19:05.045
Well, glad we got a chance
to spend some time together.

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:06.447
Me, too.

01:19:06.548 --> 01:19:08.449
Really have to go so soon?

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:10.619
Yeah, but I'll be back.

01:19:10.719 --> 01:19:12.086
Um...

01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:14.755
Thank you so much again
for everything.

01:19:14.855 --> 01:19:16.757
And honestly,
I'm just so lucky that you

01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:18.225
happen to be
at her grave that day.

01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:22.263
Well, I appreciate that,
but, uh, it wasn't quite luck.

01:19:22.997 --> 01:19:25.032
Your friends messaged me.

01:19:25.132 --> 01:19:26.300
Uh...

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.436
Lolo, Kat, and... I know
I'm gonna get this one wrong.

01:19:29.537 --> 01:19:31.071
Uh, Deadeye?

01:19:32.707 --> 01:19:34.808
Yeah. Oh, um...

01:19:34.908 --> 01:19:36.745
Yeah, my... My parents
must've told them.

01:19:36.844 --> 01:19:39.213
Yeah, they told me that
you were actually in Korea

01:19:39.313 --> 01:19:41.716
and that I might find you
if I went to the graveyard.

01:19:41.815 --> 01:19:43.183
They didn't tell you
any of this, did they?

01:19:43.284 --> 01:19:44.885
Oh, no. We, um...

01:19:44.985 --> 01:19:47.421
It's just, we got into
a little bit of a fight.

01:19:47.522 --> 01:19:48.989
And, uh, I...

01:19:49.857 --> 01:19:52.793
I lost my job
and I said some...

01:19:52.893 --> 01:19:55.462
really terrible things
to all of them and, uh...

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:58.032
It may not be
any of my business,

01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:01.435
but it seems to me that
what matters the most

01:20:01.536 --> 01:20:03.638
is if your friends love
you enough to forgive you.

01:20:03.738 --> 01:20:06.473
-Well...
-And if they went through
all this trouble,

01:20:07.408 --> 01:20:08.409
I think they would.

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:11.045
Where are they now?

01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:46.113
Hey, Kat.

01:20:50.685 --> 01:20:53.987
Listen, I... I'm sorry about
everything that happened. I...

01:20:54.088 --> 01:20:56.825
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no. I...

01:20:56.924 --> 01:20:58.626
I listened to your voicemail.

01:20:58.727 --> 01:21:02.530
The whole three hours of it.

01:21:03.598 --> 01:21:05.165
I appreciate the honesty.

01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:07.901
Truth of it is,
I kind of figured

01:21:08.001 --> 01:21:10.371
that you'd had sex before.

01:21:10.471 --> 01:21:13.407
You know, you're just
so sensual, and worldly

01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:16.276
and one time I saw your
browser history and...

01:21:16.377 --> 01:21:18.580
It's not like I didn't
wanna have sex.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.214
I was just so worried

01:21:20.314 --> 01:21:22.550
that I wouldn't live up
to your expectations.

01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:24.284
And then
when I saw your tattoo,

01:21:24.385 --> 01:21:27.722
I just got
crazy intimidated and...

01:21:27.822 --> 01:21:29.022
Look, Kat, when we kiss,

01:21:29.123 --> 01:21:30.924
I have to leave
space for Jesus.

01:21:31.024 --> 01:21:32.326
I gotta leave that God gap

01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:34.863
because I'm gonna
ruin my pants.

01:21:34.962 --> 01:21:36.196
Every time.

01:21:36.296 --> 01:21:37.832
That's why I wear
three pairs of underwear.

01:21:37.931 --> 01:21:40.635
Oh, honey. I love you so much

01:21:40.735 --> 01:21:43.504
that I gave up the thing
I love second most for you.

01:21:43.605 --> 01:21:46.473
And I love dick.

01:21:46.574 --> 01:21:48.375
I can be dick.

01:21:48.475 --> 01:21:50.978
And I can love you.
I can do both.

01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:52.514
So, should we have sex
right now?

01:21:52.614 --> 01:21:55.182
-Ah. Ooh. Ooh. Oh.
-Ah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:56.818
what's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:58.419
Ha... Save... No...

01:22:00.822 --> 01:22:01.790
Saved it.

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:02.857
-Saved it.
-Mmm.

01:22:08.797 --> 01:22:09.764
Thanks, Jin Ho.

01:22:09.864 --> 01:22:11.331
Heard you got into med school.

01:22:11.733 --> 01:22:12.700
So proud.

01:22:12.801 --> 01:22:15.002
Here you go. Hot and steamy.

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:16.270
Let me know
if you want hot sauce.

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:17.806
I'll get you the Chinese kind.

01:22:17.906 --> 01:22:19.239
Pretty sure you can handle it.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.549
-Hi.
-You had me at "Hi."

01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:28.817
Oh.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:30.718
Hi.

01:22:30.819 --> 01:22:32.119
I didn't know
you worked here now.

01:22:32.219 --> 01:22:34.054
I don't. I'm just covering
'cause Jing's out sick.

01:22:34.154 --> 01:22:36.190
I'm trying to match her vibe.
What do you think?

01:22:37.124 --> 01:22:39.694
Number 32!
Number 32!

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:41.361
Party of two!

01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:44.699
Yeah, that's good.

01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:51.271
-Lolo.
-Sorry. I'm so sorry. Um...

01:22:51.371 --> 01:22:52.874
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:54.909
Yeah, I figured
when I left her, like,

01:22:55.008 --> 01:22:57.244
ten messages and she didn't
call me back.

01:22:57.879 --> 01:22:59.413
Sorry.

01:22:59.514 --> 01:23:01.716
Family first. Have to do it.
Respectfully, of course.

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:04.886
Yeah, no, I know. I know.

01:23:04.985 --> 01:23:07.287
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

01:23:07.387 --> 01:23:09.958
Lolo! Lolo!
No, no, no. Lolo! Stop.

01:23:10.057 --> 01:23:12.359
No, no, no. Hey! Hey!
Break! Break! Stop!

01:23:12.459 --> 01:23:13.761
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:23:13.862 --> 01:23:14.929
Sorry, everyone.

01:23:15.028 --> 01:23:16.330
Enjoy your meal.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:19.901
Um, it's, it's just that
everything's a mess

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.301
and it's all my fault.

01:23:22.002 --> 01:23:23.203
Ever since we were kids,

01:23:23.303 --> 01:23:25.807
I was this scared little girl

01:23:25.907 --> 01:23:30.512
who always felt like she had
to prove herself to everyone

01:23:31.546 --> 01:23:32.547
except for you.

01:23:33.915 --> 01:23:36.450
You were always
looking out for me.

01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:41.656
<i>With you was the only time</i>
<i>I felt safe to be me.</i>

01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:46.159
Even though I didn't know
who the hell I was.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.029
But you've always been
comfortable being you.

01:23:49.129 --> 01:23:51.498
<i>And you tried to make me feel</i>
<i>that way too.</i>

01:23:51.599 --> 01:23:54.434
You know me better
than I know myself.

01:23:57.739 --> 01:23:58.773
I...

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:04.746
You were right. I hated
working at that law firm.

01:24:04.846 --> 01:24:09.182
But... Thanks to you, I can do
something more meaningful.

01:24:10.317 --> 01:24:12.386
Start my own practice.

01:24:12.486 --> 01:24:15.055
Because I know that
I'm brave enough now.

01:24:15.155 --> 01:24:16.290
Hell yeah.

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:17.992
She had a devil's threesome
in China.

01:24:18.091 --> 01:24:19.259
Huh? What?

01:24:19.359 --> 01:24:20.762
I did.

01:24:22.496 --> 01:24:23.765
Lolo, it's so great

01:24:23.865 --> 01:24:24.832
that you are working here.

01:24:24.933 --> 01:24:26.266
And I'm so proud
of you for that

01:24:27.334 --> 01:24:30.270
but you are an incredible,
true artist.

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:32.272
You cannot give that up
just because

01:24:32.372 --> 01:24:38.378
I am a lying, hurtful,
stupid failure of a friend.

01:24:38.478 --> 01:24:40.815
Audrey, I haven't given up.
Look.

01:24:42.182 --> 01:24:44.184
My wall of licky cats.

01:24:44.284 --> 01:24:45.753
I just sold one yesterday.

01:24:45.853 --> 01:24:48.923
I'm only waiting tables
for now so I'm not
such a barnacle.

01:24:49.023 --> 01:24:50.758
You've always been
a better friend to me

01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:53.895
than I have been to you.
And I'm so, so sorry.

01:24:53.995 --> 01:24:56.531
Just shut up. Okay?

01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:01.803
You're the best friend
I could ever ask for.

01:25:01.903 --> 01:25:03.236
The biggest support system.

01:25:03.337 --> 01:25:05.673
And I'm sorry. I'm the one
that's fuckin' sorry.

01:25:05.773 --> 01:25:06.874
I took you for granted.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.880
So, does that mean
you forgive me?

01:25:14.147 --> 01:25:15.349
Come here, bitch.

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:21.154
Friendship.

01:25:21.689 --> 01:25:23.256
Party of three?

01:25:23.357 --> 01:25:24.959
Oh, my God. Get in here.

01:25:25.059 --> 01:25:26.761
Deadeye.

01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:28.596
We're back, baby!

01:25:29.262 --> 01:25:30.364
Wait, are we all back?

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:32.199
Have you and Kat
started talkin' again?

01:25:32.299 --> 01:25:33.601
Yeah, I called her to apologize.

01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:36.571
But wait, does that mean
you and Kat were talking?

01:25:37.137 --> 01:25:38.238
We've been in touch.

01:25:38.338 --> 01:25:39.707
- We're like this.
- Mmm.

01:25:39.807 --> 01:25:41.308
So, we should all go on
a trip again, the four of us.

01:25:41.408 --> 01:25:45.113
To beautiful South Dakota.
Home of the Corn Palace.

01:25:45.212 --> 01:25:48.248
- Yeah.
- Bookmark it.

01:25:48.348 --> 01:25:50.250
Kat and I actually
had a place in mind.

01:25:59.794 --> 01:26:01.261
<i>Bonjour!</i>

01:26:06.466 --> 01:26:08.301
Look at us! Look at us!

01:26:08.402 --> 01:26:11.204
Our second
annual best friends trip.

01:26:11.304 --> 01:26:12.640
This is gonna be iconic.

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.742
Let's start with some
art and culture.

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:16.309
Oh, I love Roldan.

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:18.112
I gotta say, the French
know how to sculpt a titty.

01:26:18.211 --> 01:26:19.379
I love art.

01:26:19.479 --> 01:26:20.682
Oh, that's gonna be
so much fun.

01:26:20.782 --> 01:26:21.916
Art. Art. Art.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.688
So, is anyone hungry?

01:26:26.788 --> 01:26:28.056
-Yes. Please.
-I am.

01:26:28.156 --> 01:26:29.389
I want to try escargot.

01:26:29.489 --> 01:26:32.259
You know, we don't
have to eat French food.

01:26:32.359 --> 01:26:35.129
- This is so good.
- I love this bulgogi.

01:26:35.228 --> 01:26:36.631
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:26:36.731 --> 01:26:39.000
Okay, okay. A toast.

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.135
To Audrey. Badass boss bitch

01:26:41.234 --> 01:26:43.203
-starting her own firm.
-Yes, she is!

01:26:43.303 --> 01:26:44.772
To our dearest Deadeye.

01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:46.741
Because they host the most
incredible game night

01:26:46.841 --> 01:26:48.543
specifically so I can
crush them at Catan.

01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:50.545
And to Kat

01:26:50.645 --> 01:26:54.281
who's in a movie
directed by the Greta Gerwig.

01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:56.349
Yes, she is!

01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:59.419
Okay. And to our very own
Frida Kah-Lolo...

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.822
Aw.

01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:03.323
...whose lotus collection
is finally at the MOCA.

01:27:03.423 --> 01:27:05.325
Well, it's not the Museum of
Contemporary Arts

01:27:05.425 --> 01:27:08.629
but it is a cafe in Snohomish.
So <i>ganbei</i> to that.

01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:10.464
<i>Ganbei!</i>

01:27:10.565 --> 01:27:12.633
- Mmm.
- I don't wanna hijack

01:27:12.734 --> 01:27:16.470
our second annual
best friends trip

01:27:16.571 --> 01:27:18.873
but Clar-Bear and I looking at
fall dates for the wedding

01:27:18.973 --> 01:27:21.008
and I was just wondering...

01:27:21.976 --> 01:27:23.443
will you all be
my bridal party?

01:27:23.544 --> 01:27:24.879
- Really? Of course.
- Of course, we will.

01:27:24.979 --> 01:27:26.413
- Duh!
- Ooh!

01:27:26.514 --> 01:27:29.150
The bridal party should all get
matching tattoos like Kat.

01:27:29.249 --> 01:27:30.518
Okay, very funny.

01:27:30.618 --> 01:27:32.120
Very funny. Ha-ha.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.755
<i>Ganbei!</i>

01:27:34.722 --> 01:27:35.857
Mmm.

01:27:35.957 --> 01:27:38.325
Mmm. Or we could get a tattoo
of the Chinese flag

01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.128
to commemorate the motherland.

01:27:40.228 --> 01:27:42.130
Or Princess Peach.
I haven't decided.

01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:43.831
I think I'm gonna get
an Eiffel Tower.

01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:46.601
- Because Paris?
- No, the...

01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:47.769
Hmm. Yeah.

01:27:47.869 --> 01:27:49.604
Yeah, like you all are
gonna get tattoos.

01:27:49.704 --> 01:27:51.205
<i>What if I already got one?</i>

01:27:53.107 --> 01:27:54.274
I already got one.

01:27:54.374 --> 01:27:55.643
- You did not.
- What?

01:27:55.743 --> 01:27:56.744
Wanna see?

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:03.751
It lights up.

01:28:04.085 --> 01:28:05.186
Ooh!
