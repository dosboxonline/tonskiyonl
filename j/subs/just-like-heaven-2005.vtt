01:08.636 --> 01:09.967
Elizabeth.

01:11.306 --> 01:14.366
- How long was I out?
- About six minutes.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.636
Thanks.

01:16.211 --> 01:19.442
- OK. I'll be right there.
- OK, I'll be outside. Hey, Fran.

01:20.715 --> 01:22.376
What are you still doin' here?

01:22.450 --> 01:25.248
- How long you been on?
- Twenty-three.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.584
Twenty-three?
Time to go, Elizabeth.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.919
That's not gonna get me
an attending slot.

01:29.991 --> 01:33.119
Adams? She needs to know
how to redress her sutures,

01:33.194 --> 01:34.889
but then she can be discharged.

01:34.963 --> 01:38.262
No, no. Ellis needs an EKG.
I don't like these swollen ankles.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.459
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.934
Hey. I took care of Trauma Two
while you slept.

01:42.003 --> 01:44.870
- I wasn't sleeping, I was just...
- You're welcome.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.600
You're on in five and eight.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.406
Jenny? You seen Jenny?

01:52.480 --> 01:55.415
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.781
Hi, Mr. Clarke.
I'm Dr. Masterson.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.013
We're gonna need a CBC,
lytes and a UA.

02:00.088 --> 02:03.182
Anything I can do to make you
feel more comfortable today?

02:03.258 --> 02:05.624
- Marry me?
- Wow.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.025
No, I have my own bus pass.

02:08.096 --> 02:09.757
Well, then how could I refuse?

02:09.830 --> 02:13.767
Let me just call my sister and see if
I can borrow her dress. You sit tight.

02:13.835 --> 02:16.861
Keep an eye on my fiancé,
and decrease his morphine drip.

02:21.009 --> 02:22.408
Doin' OK?

02:26.314 --> 02:28.145
Clear bed four.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.380
Sir, you wanna step over...

02:36.391 --> 02:38.951
I got it. I got it.

02:39.027 --> 02:40.358
I got it.

02:42.464 --> 02:44.659
- I was just about to...
- You're welcome.

02:58.513 --> 03:00.105
Thank you.

03:01.049 --> 03:04.143
UTI progressing into infection.
Pneumonia. Diabetic coma.

03:04.219 --> 03:06.278
<i>Una problema con sus rlñones.</i>

03:06.354 --> 03:10.120
I'll have a Venti, triple-shot,
sugar-free, vanilla, nonfat cappuccino.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.486
- Doctor.
- Mr. Clarke?

03:14.562 --> 03:15.927
Will you marry me?

03:15.997 --> 03:19.558
Of course, Mr. Clarke. But first,
we need to find you a robe. Jenny?

03:19.634 --> 03:21.795
Sorry. Sorry. I'm here.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.567
Going full Kabuki tonight, Fran?

03:24.639 --> 03:27.335
The dark circles
were scaring the patients.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.171
And she's got a hot date tonight.

03:29.244 --> 03:32.839
Stop! I'm going out to dinner
with my ex and his mother.

03:32.914 --> 03:35.109
He still hasn't told her
we're divorced.

03:35.183 --> 03:37.981
I won't be responsible for killing
an 80-year-old woman.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.576
I'll trade nights with you.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.418
I've gotta go home and sew
six caterpillar costumes

03:42.490 --> 03:44.720
with Velcro legs
for Katie's dance class.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.851
I don't know
how you guys do it.

03:46.928 --> 03:50.694
Nick is totally pushing me for kids.
I don't have time to shave my legs.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.393
- Stop shaving. He'll leave you alone.
- Really?

03:53.468 --> 03:57.131
Elizabeth, you're so lucky that all
you have to worry about is work.

04:05.146 --> 04:08.343
- Dr. Masterson, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'll be right out.

04:10.051 --> 04:12.417
- Ankle in bed two.
- OK, there's no fracture.

04:12.487 --> 04:15.479
Just wrap it up
and send him home. Thanks.

04:15.557 --> 04:17.286
- Hello?
- Are you really coming?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.483
Yes, I'm coming.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.755
Good. Because this guy is great.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.557
You met him? Is he there?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.928
I haven't actually
met him in person.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.331
Abby, you're not setting me up
with a stranger.

04:27.402 --> 04:30.166
He's a friend of an old friend.
He's really nice.

04:30.238 --> 04:33.105
What does that mean,
fat with a good sense of humor?

04:33.174 --> 04:34.300
Not again, Abby.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.366
It wasn't easy
to get this guy to come.

04:36.444 --> 04:40.073
He doesn't do this kind of thing either.
Do you girls have to do that here?

04:40.148 --> 04:42.912
Do we not have six other rooms
in the house? Help Mommy.

04:42.984 --> 04:45.953
I'm in the seventh circle of hell,
you better show up.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.885
I'll be there.
I'm just really busy.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.925
Don't you dare. You don't know
the meaning of the word.

04:50.992 --> 04:54.587
I'm doin' you this huge favor here.
Beggars can't be choosers.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.290
I am completely capable
of meeting men on my own.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.859
I know. I'd just like you
to meet one who's not bleeding.

05:01.936 --> 05:04.928
I've already had
two marriage proposals today.

05:05.006 --> 05:06.530
- Marry me.
- Yes, Mr. Clarke.

05:06.608 --> 05:08.371
Yes, of course.
Make that three.

05:08.443 --> 05:10.308
- I'll see ya at seven.
- It is seven.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.710
Thirty. 7:30.
What are you making?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.476
Lasagna. Mom's recipe.
No carbohydrate comments.

05:15.550 --> 05:20.078
Please. I'm going on a day and a half
of cafeteria salad. Anything'll do.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.145
Who put SpongeBob in the pasta?

05:22.223 --> 05:23.781
I gotta go.

05:23.858 --> 05:25.291
So, what are you gonna do?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.624
The only other option is Phoenix.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.391
- Would you consider it?
- Phoenix, San Francisco.

05:30.465 --> 05:34.765
Old people and melanomas versus
great sushi and desperate women.

05:34.836 --> 05:35.996
Walsh likes you.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.698
Dr. Walsh. Gunshot victim,
internal hemorrhaging.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.704
- How long have you been here?
- Twelve hours.

05:43.378 --> 05:44.709
A few more.

05:45.647 --> 05:48.309
- All right, Brett.
- I'll scrub up.

05:50.852 --> 05:51.978
Elizabeth.

05:52.053 --> 05:53.645
Yes, sir.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.518
I was going to wait till tomorrow,

05:55.590 --> 05:59.424
but I wanted to let you know
that I've made my decision.

05:59.494 --> 06:01.928
I want you to stay on
as an attending physician.

06:01.996 --> 06:03.861
Really? Thank you.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.694
- Hey. Hey.
- Thank you, Dr. Walsh.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.257
You've earned it.

06:07.335 --> 06:10.099
Unlike some others,
you spend more time being concerned

06:10.171 --> 06:12.765
with what's best for the patient
than kissing my ass.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.206
A risky move, but I like it.

06:15.276 --> 06:18.074
Sir, I can't thank you enough
for this opportunity.

06:18.146 --> 06:21.513
There's so much I want to do here.
I can't wait to get started.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.482
- Elizabeth?
- Yes?

06:23.551 --> 06:26.987
The only thing I need you
to do right now is go home.

06:27.055 --> 06:29.182
- But, sir, I... I have...
- Go.

06:29.257 --> 06:30.986
You've been here 26 hours.

06:32.126 --> 06:33.491
I know all.

06:50.445 --> 06:52.709
- Dr. Masterson.
- Yeah?

06:53.648 --> 06:56.173
I have a bowel obstruction in six.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.583
At least, I think that's what it is.
Can you take a quick peek?

07:00.321 --> 07:02.414
Yeah, of course.

07:07.729 --> 07:09.458
- Brett.
- Congratulations.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.896
Thank you. I didn't know
Walsh was gonna...

07:11.966 --> 07:14.196
I have an offer in Phoenix.
Life's good.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.463
That's great. That's great.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.868
It's fine.

07:23.978 --> 07:25.411
- Hey, Abby, it's me.
- Hey.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.539
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know. I'm on my way.

07:27.615 --> 07:31.449
- Don't worry. Your date's late too.
- Listen. I have good news.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.886
I got the attending position.
I'm staying in San Francisco.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.288
Oh, that's great!
Well, get over here.

07:37.358 --> 07:40.816
- We're breakin' out the champagne.
- I'll be there in a minute. Bye.

07:55.443 --> 07:57.502
This place is heaven.

08:01.516 --> 08:03.643
It's been photographed
for magazines.

08:06.454 --> 08:10.322
Yeah. I think I told you I was
gonna need something furnished.

08:10.391 --> 08:11.983
Well, it is furnished.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.993
Where's the couch?

08:18.599 --> 08:21.727
Do you believe all of this space?

08:21.803 --> 08:25.637
Yeah, it's great
for all those raves I'll be throwing.

08:29.744 --> 08:32.405
I'm... sensing a "no."

08:34.148 --> 08:35.479
Wow, huh?

08:36.417 --> 08:38.681
I know. This place
isn't usually available,

08:38.753 --> 08:42.553
but the couple's spending all their time
in Palm Springs now.

09:20.094 --> 09:23.325
David, I'm just not quite sure
what you're looking for.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.888
Maybe if we could
communicate a little more.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.935
Maybe if you could
let me know a bit more

09:28.002 --> 09:31.836
about what's going on with you,
with your job, your family situation.

09:31.906 --> 09:34.306
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Here's an idea:

09:34.375 --> 09:38.141
Stop looking for a couple
of months. Start again.

09:38.212 --> 09:40.305
You've gotta know
where you wanna live.

09:40.381 --> 09:42.872
I just... I'm... I'm not...

09:42.950 --> 09:44.577
...getting what it is you...

09:46.520 --> 09:48.750
Hey, well... no. David.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.552
David, are you kidding?

09:50.625 --> 09:52.490
Wait, David. Look, come on.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.755
A place like this,
it is long gone by now.

09:54.829 --> 09:58.424
No, listen, there's 90 vultures
and just one carcass.

09:58.499 --> 10:01.730
All right, fine. I'll call them.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.905
He did? OK.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.305
Well, right.
As soon as I know.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.571
Thank you so much for your help.

10:11.913 --> 10:14.780
Well, it's pretty obvious
why this hasn't rented.

10:14.849 --> 10:17.841
There's no one-year lease.
It's a month-to-month sublet.

10:17.919 --> 10:20.547
- Why?
- Some family matter.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.919
They were pretty
close-mouthed about it.

10:26.861 --> 10:28.522
Wow, what a view.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.405
David.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.143
Wow.

10:48.015 --> 10:51.678
This is... sensational.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.550
Oh, my God.
And it's got the private access?

10:56.624 --> 10:58.148
They didn't do much with it,

10:58.225 --> 11:02.491
but, I mean, you really
could do something with this.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.690
Isn't this gorgeous?

11:14.909 --> 11:18.902
Well, there's a few places
in the Richmond we haven't hit yet.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.379
I like the couch.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.779
The couch.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.476
Good couch.

11:26.187 --> 11:27.518
Good couch.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.407
David. David, come here.

12:05.693 --> 12:08.856
- What? What?
- There's nothing worth stealing here.

12:08.929 --> 12:12.092
- There's no money, no drugs.
- I'm not stealing anything.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.760
OK. I'm sure there's
a homeless shelter nearby.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.395
I will give you money
for cab fare and a good meal.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.701
But please, don't blow it
on more beer, OK?

12:19.774 --> 12:22.368
I am not homeless. I live here.

12:22.443 --> 12:26.038
OK. You can't live here,
because I live here.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.444
This is my apartment.

12:27.515 --> 12:30.075
- Since when?
- Since I rented it.

12:30.151 --> 12:31.516
- You rented it.
- Yeah.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.917
- You know what? I don't need this.
- What?

12:33.988 --> 12:36.548
- Rent scam, right?
- What are you talking about?

12:36.624 --> 12:40.424
There's probably five other people
who paid deposits and got the keys.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.758
- And moved in all their things?
- Yeah... What?

12:42.830 --> 12:45.264
This is my stuff. All of this.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.596
That's my couch,
that's my coffee table.

12:47.668 --> 12:49.465
Is that a ring?

12:49.537 --> 12:51.266
Have you ever heard
of a coaster?

12:51.338 --> 12:53.135
Or a trash can, for that matter?

12:53.207 --> 12:57.405
I don't care who you are, you're gonna
mop that up. I'm getting the bucket.

12:57.478 --> 12:59.605
It's like a pig
moved into my house.

12:59.814 --> 13:02.078
- What?
- Like a filthy pig.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.912
You... You moved in when?

13:16.430 --> 13:17.761
Hello?

13:44.592 --> 13:46.389
- I told you to get out.
- Jesus!

13:54.969 --> 13:57.995
OK. So, what's this all about?

13:58.072 --> 13:59.130
What? Nothin'.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.400
Nothin'.

14:00.474 --> 14:02.066
So, you called me for nothin'?

14:02.143 --> 14:04.611
I've been sort of
seeing someone.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.943
Seeing someone?
That's what I'm talkin' about. Finally.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.007
- You think it's a good thing?
- Absolutely.

14:11.085 --> 14:14.111
Yeah. The last time I tried
to hook you up, you bailed out.

14:14.188 --> 14:17.282
This is good, and the fact
that you initiated it yourself,

14:17.358 --> 14:20.225
that's important. OK?
Now, who is she? Do I know her?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.694
I mean I'm seeing someone
that's not there.

14:22.763 --> 14:24.754
She's emotionally unavailable?

14:28.302 --> 14:30.930
You mean like a hallucination.

14:31.672 --> 14:33.833
Twice, in my apartment.

14:33.908 --> 14:35.341
A woman.

14:35.409 --> 14:36.501
Attractive?

14:37.511 --> 14:40.378
- Not really there, Jack.
- Right. Right. OK.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.746
So when you saw this woman,
were you drunk?

14:45.186 --> 14:47.177
I mean, I had a little buzz.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.347
Dave, don't lie to me,
it doesn't help.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.152
OK, fine, I was wasted.

14:51.225 --> 14:54.558
But still, I shouldn't be seeing
some little blonde control freak

14:54.628 --> 14:56.255
running around my apartment.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.527
Why are you writing this down?
This isn't a session.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.537
That's insulting, OK? I'm your friend
Jack here, I'm not charging you.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.800
But if this thing rolls
into a second hour

15:06.874 --> 15:09.934
we're gonna have to work out
some kind of deal. I'm kidding.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.137
So, hold on a second.
You were drunk,

15:12.213 --> 15:15.376
- you saw this blonde, controlling...
- I gotta stop drinkin'.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.144
- No.
- No?

15:17.218 --> 15:20.187
Yeah, drink, party.
Just do it with other people.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.814
God gave us alcohol
as a social lubricant.

15:22.890 --> 15:25.290
Make men brave,
make women loose.

15:25.359 --> 15:28.590
What is that,
some Berkeley shrink thing?

15:28.662 --> 15:30.289
No. Look around you, OK?

15:30.364 --> 15:33.333
See this? This is the world.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.628
Join it.

15:34.702 --> 15:36.727
Stop swimming around
in your own mind.

15:36.804 --> 15:40.069
That is a dangerous neighborhood
you should not go into alone.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.405
Come on, Dave.
It's been two years, man.

15:43.477 --> 15:45.138
No more hiding out.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.811
Absolutely not.

16:37.765 --> 16:40.928
- Are you insane? What are you doing?
- Oh, God, what is this?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.231
I didn't want to,
but I will call the police.

16:43.304 --> 16:45.636
I'm sleeping. It's a dream.

16:45.706 --> 16:48.641
It's one of those dreams
and you know you're dreaming.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.769
- How do you keep getting in here?
- It's you who's in here.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.312
Oh, my.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.405
This is more serious than I thought.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.915
Go away, you don't exist.

16:56.984 --> 16:59.111
I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.949
I want you to answer honestly.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.751
Has your recent
alcohol consumption increased?

17:03.824 --> 17:05.451
Yeah, so?

17:05.526 --> 17:09.428
Are you hearing voices or seeing
things that aren't quite real to you?

17:09.496 --> 17:11.430
As a matter of fact, yeah.

17:11.498 --> 17:15.263
Have you recently sought consult
from a mental health care professional?

17:15.336 --> 17:17.429
What? How do you know?
Stay away from me.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.029
Do you feel paranoid,
like people are out to get you?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.938
Why are you asking
so many questions?

17:22.009 --> 17:25.342
I'll take that as a yes.
Listen to me.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.279
You have fantasized,
quite convincingly,

17:28.348 --> 17:32.683
that you've rented an apartment that,
in fact, belongs to somebody else.

17:32.753 --> 17:34.948
Pick up that pillow.

17:35.022 --> 17:37.149
Pick it up. It's OK.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.192
There's a small red stain
on the back

17:39.259 --> 17:41.625
where I once spilled
cherry cough syrup.

17:41.695 --> 17:44.755
Yes, that's it.
How else would I know that?

17:44.832 --> 17:48.700
Or the fact that these sheets that
you're now soiling are from Nordstrom.

17:48.769 --> 17:51.169
I still have the receipt,
it's in that drawer.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.967
Open it up and check.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.441
I think you need to
come to terms with the fact

17:56.510 --> 17:58.171
that you may be mentally ill.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.441
- Really?
- Yes.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.974
This is my apartment.
These are my sheets.

18:05.052 --> 18:07.714
That's my nightstand.
That's my picture...

18:10.057 --> 18:12.491
- Where's my picture?
- What picture?

18:12.559 --> 18:15.392
There was a picture there of my...

18:15.462 --> 18:18.727
There was a picture
right there on the nightstand.

18:18.799 --> 18:21.734
- That was empty when I moved in.
- It was just there.

18:21.802 --> 18:24.930
You know what? I've had enough.
I am calling the police.

18:25.005 --> 18:27.064
- No, no, no, no.
- It's too late.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.078
What'd you do to my phone?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.948
Why can't I?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.481
You stay right there.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.545
I'm gonna use the one in the kitchen.

18:49.930 --> 18:51.795
Hey, Grace,
David Abbott here.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.095
The people who sublet
this apartment to me,

18:54.168 --> 18:56.636
- do you have their number?
- Is something wrong?

18:56.703 --> 19:00.935
No, no. I was just wondering
about the previous tenant, that's all.

19:01.008 --> 19:04.944
Well, the woman that I dealt with,
she didn't want to talk about it.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.242
It was some kind of
tragedy in the family.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.477
I didn't press for details
'cause I don't need any more drama.

19:10.551 --> 19:13.987
- You think this girl died?
- Well, you better hope so.

19:14.054 --> 19:16.352
That's the only way
they're gonna get off

19:16.423 --> 19:19.256
this month-to-month thing
and give you a real lease.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.625
- That's not exactly the reason I was...
- Come on, David, grow up.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.664
Look, it has a view, a fireplace.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.394
People would kill their grandmothers
for a lot less in this city.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.825
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

20:01.902 --> 20:05.633
I mean, do you believe in this stuff?

20:05.706 --> 20:08.641
Well, you don't until you do.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.574
That's a little dated.

20:10.644 --> 20:14.239
I recommend the Rosemary Preston.
It's totally seminal.

20:14.314 --> 20:17.181
'Scuse me.
Where's your UFO section?

20:17.251 --> 20:19.116
It's back and to the left.

20:19.186 --> 20:22.519
Ufology. It's not even
a real science.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.887
So, what kind of encounter
have you had?

20:24.958 --> 20:27.324
- Encounter?
- Ectoplasm?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.385
Somniferous ether?

20:29.463 --> 20:32.990
I have a killer séance book
if you're into communication.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.261
Communicating is not her problem.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.669
Righteous.
I have exactly what you need.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.806
Yeah.

20:50.150 --> 20:51.481
Crap!

20:54.087 --> 20:55.076
There.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.089
"Spirit, awake.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.294
Spirit, partake.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.331
Spirit, without fear.

21:05.399 --> 21:08.061
Spirit, appear."

21:12.573 --> 21:14.302
Are... are you here?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.470
Come on, I think you're here.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.640
OK.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.653
I've got a hot, moist
cup of coffee in my hand.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.315
There is no coaster on this table.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.019
I'm going to set it down
on this lovely mahogany...

21:34.094 --> 21:35.652
Don't you dare!

21:36.530 --> 21:38.293
We... We need to talk.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.423
About what?

21:42.002 --> 21:46.029
Has it crossed your mind that there
might be something a little off

21:46.106 --> 21:48.939
about the way you've
been spending your days?

21:49.009 --> 21:52.536
Actually, yes. It's weird having
a squatter in your living room.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.137
I am not...

21:55.782 --> 21:57.044
OK, let's start over.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.017
Hi, I'm David Abbott.

21:59.086 --> 22:00.986
And you are?

22:01.054 --> 22:03.147
I am...

22:05.359 --> 22:07.953
I'm Elizabeth.
My name is Elizabeth.

22:08.028 --> 22:11.054
You didn't know that.
You... you had to read that.

22:11.131 --> 22:13.622
I think I know my own name.

22:13.700 --> 22:17.033
OK. When was the last time
that you remember

22:17.104 --> 22:19.937
actually talking to someone
other than me?

22:20.007 --> 22:22.441
The other day. The other day.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.171
And... And when you're not here,

22:25.245 --> 22:28.510
what do you do
with the rest of your day?

22:28.582 --> 22:31.483
Certainly a lot more
than you do, that's for sure.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.678
Let's not stray from the point, Lizzie.

22:33.754 --> 22:36.154
Don't call me Lizzie.
I'm not in kindergarten.

22:36.223 --> 22:38.885
- My name's Elizabeth.
- You think. Let me ask you,

22:38.959 --> 22:41.792
has anything dramatic
happened to you recently?

22:41.862 --> 22:43.056
Like what?

22:43.130 --> 22:45.655
I don't know, like dying maybe?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.131
How dare you say that to me?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.394
OK, calm down.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.936
Get your hands off of me, you pervert!

22:51.004 --> 22:53.598
Calm down. I'm not...
I'm not here to hurt you.

22:53.674 --> 22:56.006
I'm trying to help you
face the fact that...

22:56.076 --> 22:57.805
- I'm not dead.
- Look around you.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.470
There should be a bright light.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.174
- There's no light.
- Walk into the light, Elizabeth!

23:02.249 --> 23:06.447
There is no light! I am not dead!
I think I would know if I was dead!

23:11.558 --> 23:13.116
What's happening to me?

23:13.193 --> 23:14.455
You're dead!

23:14.528 --> 23:16.621
Stop saying that!

23:16.697 --> 23:18.028
Missed.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.860
OK. OK, that's enough.
That's enough.

23:22.936 --> 23:25.530
You're just giving me a headache!
Get off of me!

23:25.605 --> 23:26.970
OK. All right, all right.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.304
It's not my fault
you're the way you are.

23:29.376 --> 23:31.844
- I just want you out of my house.
- You get out!

23:35.449 --> 23:37.508
Rest in peace.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.778
I'm not leaving.

23:55.469 --> 23:57.061
Another one, my, my.

23:58.672 --> 24:00.697
Golden State playing very well...

24:00.774 --> 24:03.641
I love ya
Tomorrow

24:03.710 --> 24:07.737
You're only a day away

24:07.814 --> 24:10.908
Tomorrow, tomorrow

24:10.984 --> 24:13.885
I love ya
Tomorrow

24:13.954 --> 24:18.391
You're only a day away

24:18.458 --> 24:19.789
Fine!

24:21.428 --> 24:25.091
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow

24:25.165 --> 24:28.100
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

24:28.168 --> 24:30.534
You know what? That's it.
I've had it with you.

24:30.604 --> 24:33.368
I've tried to be nice,
but now you're outta here!

24:33.440 --> 24:35.772
The power of Christ compels you!

24:35.842 --> 24:38.640
The power of Christ compels you!

24:38.712 --> 24:41.374
The power of Christ compels you!

24:41.448 --> 24:44.713
The power of Christ compels you!

24:44.785 --> 24:46.548
He can't even see me.

24:46.620 --> 24:47.882
A little more left.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.650
- You're mopping that up.
- More, more.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.264
They're gonna set off
the smoke detector.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.332
Dad, we got it!

25:17.284 --> 25:21.084
All set, sir. We have the spirit.

25:21.154 --> 25:22.382
A butter dish.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.254
- You sure?
- Oh, definitely.

25:25.325 --> 25:27.122
I have him right here.

25:27.194 --> 25:28.821
I'm gonna go give him a flush.

25:34.501 --> 25:35.627
That's it?

25:35.702 --> 25:37.169
You just sit there?

25:37.237 --> 25:40.934
Hey, you want bells and whistles
or a reading?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.032
Come on.
He can't see me, either.

25:43.109 --> 25:47.170
- For some hideous reason, only you can.
- OK, there's somethin'.

25:47.247 --> 25:49.215
Definitely a presence.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.716
How original. Tell me more.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.719
It's hostile.

25:53.787 --> 25:55.345
Wants you outta here.

25:55.422 --> 25:57.117
Actually, he's not bad.

25:57.190 --> 25:58.680
You should move, dude.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.393
- I should move?
- I would.

26:01.461 --> 26:02.826
I like him.

26:02.896 --> 26:04.488
No, I'm not gonna move.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.929
Can't you feel that, man?

26:05.999 --> 26:08.832
There's like this
cancer-causing ray of spirit hate

26:08.902 --> 26:11.962
- searing right towards your body.
- This kid's got a gift.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.063
- I'm not moving!
- Why not?

26:14.140 --> 26:16.540
It's not like it's that great
an apartment.

26:16.610 --> 26:17.872
- What?
- Yes, it is.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.878
- It's got a view.
- And a fireplace.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.038
Whatever, dude.

26:21.114 --> 26:23.582
Yo, do you have,
like, a diet anything?

26:23.650 --> 26:26.244
I'm, like, 99.9 percent
parched here.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.048
Could really use a cola.

26:29.689 --> 26:30.883
Yeah. Come on.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.167
Move out?
That... that can't be it.

26:43.236 --> 26:46.069
Could you talk to her
and tell her she should pass on?

26:46.139 --> 26:48.039
"Could you please talk to her?"

26:48.108 --> 26:50.167
- I'm ignoring you.
- I'm ignoring you.

26:50.243 --> 26:53.701
She won't accept that she's dead.
I told her to walk to the light.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.838
She wouldn't do it.

26:54.915 --> 26:58.180
That's because there is no light.
God, you're infuriating!

26:58.251 --> 26:59.843
Wait, what's goin' on?

27:01.988 --> 27:04.183
You know what?
Do you think I like this?

27:04.257 --> 27:05.952
Do you think this is easy for me?

27:06.026 --> 27:08.961
I know something's different,
something is not right.

27:09.029 --> 27:11.054
- I'm walking through walls.
- You know,

27:11.131 --> 27:12.655
I don't think I can help you.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.963
This is one of the most
alive spirits I've ever been around.

27:16.036 --> 27:18.368
- She's not goin' anywhere.
- What do you mean?

27:18.438 --> 27:21.805
I agree with her, dude.
She's not dead.

27:24.511 --> 27:27.173
But you, whoa.

27:27.247 --> 27:29.909
You gotta deal with this...

27:33.954 --> 27:37.481
'Cause seriously, that's like
the darkest aura I've ever seen.

27:37.557 --> 27:41.118
Suckin' the life right outta you.
It's killin' you, man.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.726
You have to let her go, dude.

27:43.797 --> 27:46.789
How can I, when she won't leave?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.629
Not your spirit girl.

27:48.702 --> 27:50.670
I'm talkin' 'bout the other one.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.796
The one you're keepin' in here.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.306
That's what's really
haunting you, isn't it?

27:56.176 --> 27:59.043
- I don't want to talk about that.
- I get it.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.636
You were dumped.

28:00.714 --> 28:04.081
Probably for some guy who doesn't
have a couch fused to his ass.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.139
Shut up.

28:05.218 --> 28:07.186
You can dish it out
but you can't take it?

28:07.253 --> 28:11.189
You bring Father Flanagan
and the Joy Luck Club to get rid of me.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.384
But I talk about you
getting dumped once...

28:13.460 --> 28:17.055
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about. Shut the hell up!

28:17.130 --> 28:19.189
Sorry for your loss, bro.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.469
A word to the wise, girl.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.732
Show some respect for the dead.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.408
David?

28:40.487 --> 28:42.148
I'm sorry.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.752
It occurred to me now that I...

28:47.827 --> 28:50.159
...probably don't know you
all that well.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.632
I got this place for the roof.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.862
I was gonna do
a whole garden out here...

29:00.440 --> 29:03.238
...eventually, I think.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.106
Now I'm babbling.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.645
I...

29:07.847 --> 29:09.178
I'm really sorry.

29:10.984 --> 29:14.977
Most people who deal with loss really
find it helpful to talk about things.

29:15.055 --> 29:17.250
I don't want to talk about it!

29:17.323 --> 29:19.314
Anger works too.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.994
Who was he talking about?

29:24.064 --> 29:26.328
Laura. Her name was Laura.

29:26.399 --> 29:28.333
Who's Laura?

29:28.401 --> 29:30.232
She was my wife.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.068
What do you think I am, stupid?

29:39.145 --> 29:41.807
What is this? Oh, come on.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.413
Don't. This is not gonna help.

29:49.489 --> 29:52.287
How would you know? Have
you ever been in a bar in your life?

29:59.299 --> 30:01.290
The groundhog emerges!

30:01.367 --> 30:04.302
I didn't think you'd make it.
All right! All right!

30:04.370 --> 30:07.237
It's Jeff, Jody, Kim, Valerie.

30:07.307 --> 30:08.638
This is my buddy, Dave.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.767
- Nice to meet you.
- What are you drinkin'?

30:10.844 --> 30:12.368
- Coffee.
- Scotch!

30:12.445 --> 30:14.310
- Don't you dare!
- Make it a double!

30:14.380 --> 30:17.577
You don't have to wait.
I can start the hangover right now.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.385
Yeah. Yeah.

30:21.454 --> 30:23.547
He's excited to be out. I know!

30:23.623 --> 30:24.749
Friday night!

30:24.824 --> 30:27.384
- You can't drink these feelings away.
- Watch me.

30:29.762 --> 30:31.093
So, you OK?

30:31.164 --> 30:34.463
Say goodbye, walk to the door,
let's get some food in your stomach.

30:34.534 --> 30:36.263
Who made you my mother?

30:37.470 --> 30:38.801
Did I?

30:38.872 --> 30:41.397
How you comin' along
with those hallucinations?

30:41.474 --> 30:43.965
- That was nothing.
- You're not a well man, David.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.342
- It's just a lack of sleep.
- Sleep? You gettin' any?

30:47.413 --> 30:49.108
- Eight hours.
- Twelve.

30:49.182 --> 30:52.413
- Nine, tops.
- Opium addicts are more alert than you.

30:52.485 --> 30:55.010
- Will you knock it off.
- Don't you dare!

30:55.088 --> 30:56.646
Don't!

30:56.723 --> 30:57.747
Last chance.

30:57.824 --> 30:59.917
What are you gonna do about it?

31:11.237 --> 31:12.329
Dave, buddy!

31:18.945 --> 31:20.276
I'm so...

31:21.714 --> 31:23.443
I'm sorry. God!

31:23.516 --> 31:25.984
- You freak!
- Dave, that is uncool, man!

31:32.392 --> 31:33.518
Good God!

31:33.593 --> 31:35.788
You're gonna thank me
for that one day.

31:35.862 --> 31:39.593
For what? Making me look like a lunatic
in front of all those people?

31:52.879 --> 31:54.744
Why are you still here?

31:55.682 --> 31:59.311
That's a scary question.
I have no idea.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.148
Why are you the only one
that can see me?

32:01.221 --> 32:02.552
Don't ask me.

32:03.690 --> 32:07.956
All I know is when I'm not with you,
it's like I don't... exist.

32:09.796 --> 32:11.559
Oh, my God.

32:11.631 --> 32:13.292
Maybe I am dead.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.163
Oh, come on now.

32:20.173 --> 32:22.368
I'm... I'm sorry
that I said you're dead.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.909
Maybe you're not dead.

32:23.977 --> 32:26.775
Maybe you're just very... light.

32:28.581 --> 32:32.176
If I could just remember something
about who I am, or was.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.482
I mean, then I'd know
once and for all.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.524
I'm trying to figure it out. I...

32:39.592 --> 32:41.457
I just can't do it by myself.

32:44.931 --> 32:47.957
You're not asking me to...
to help you, are you?

32:48.034 --> 32:49.433
Look.

32:49.502 --> 32:51.561
You have two realities
to choose from.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.334
First one being that a woman
has come into your life

32:54.407 --> 32:57.968
in a very unconventional way
and she happens to need your assistance.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.477
Right.

32:59.545 --> 33:02.139
The second one is that
you're an insane person,

33:02.215 --> 33:04.513
sitting on a park bench
talking to yourself.

33:06.619 --> 33:08.644
I think I prefer the first one.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.450
OK.

33:10.523 --> 33:11.956
Let's find out who I am.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.961
No. I think that apartment was vacant.

33:21.401 --> 33:22.732
That was a woman?

33:24.304 --> 33:25.828
Nobody live there.

33:25.905 --> 33:28.339
It's like I was a ghost
before I was dead.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.804
Hi. Can I help you?

33:32.879 --> 33:35.575
Finally, somebody normal.
I bet we were friends.

33:35.648 --> 33:38.139
Hi, I'm... I'm David.
I am a new tenant here.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.617
Hi, David, Katrina.
Come on in.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.747
- She's friendly, I like her.
- This'll just take a sec.

33:43.823 --> 33:47.691
I have a question. The apartment
upstairs, it belonged to a young woman.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.058
Yeah, I think there
was somebody up there.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.290
But she was, like, totally antisocial.

33:52.365 --> 33:54.629
OK, maybe we weren't close friends.

33:54.701 --> 33:57.864
Kinda like a cat lady,
but without any cats.

33:57.937 --> 33:59.336
Right?

33:59.405 --> 34:01.600
OK, I think we're done here. Let's go.

34:01.674 --> 34:04.074
- OK, thank you.
- Look. This is so retro,

34:04.143 --> 34:06.475
but I've got a window
I can't get open.

34:06.546 --> 34:08.342
- She's got to be kidding.
- What?

34:08.414 --> 34:09.438
- What?
- What?

34:09.514 --> 34:11.346
She wants you to come in.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.940
Well, if it's painted shut

34:13.018 --> 34:15.817
and you use a screwdriver
to jam it, it sometimes...

34:15.888 --> 34:17.355
Oh, tried it.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.014
Won't budge.

34:19.092 --> 34:22.061
No preliminaries. Incredible.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.995
I'd like to help,
but I have dinner plans.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.123
Well, I got dessert.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.827
I just threw up in my mouth.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.426
Well, OK. I...

34:33.172 --> 34:34.161
Nice to meet you.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.706
- You too, Dave.
- Thanks.

34:37.377 --> 34:39.469
Why is she wearing workout clothes?

34:39.545 --> 34:42.241
If you were gonna work out
in the middle of the day,

34:42.315 --> 34:46.217
the only reason to wear workout clothes,
do you really need a push-up bra?

34:46.284 --> 34:48.081
The whole point's
to strap 'em down.

34:48.154 --> 34:51.817
- You're not comin' with me anymore.
- Why? Something might jog my memory.

34:51.891 --> 34:56.225
Too bad. You're like an AM radio someone
shoved in my head and I can't turn off.

34:56.295 --> 35:00.026
You don't think she was
completely un-classy and predatory?

35:00.099 --> 35:02.590
Those happen to be
two of men's favorite things.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.728
- Why don't you just date a pit bull?
- Maybe I will.

35:05.805 --> 35:07.739
- Damn it!
- What?

35:08.875 --> 35:10.866
I locked my key in the apartment.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.673
There's a spare key
under the fire extinguisher.

35:13.746 --> 35:17.876
I mean, I guess she's sexy if you're
into that whole tall, big boobs,

35:17.950 --> 35:20.180
long legs, model-y sorta thing.

35:20.253 --> 35:22.448
I guess if you wanna be that guy.

35:22.522 --> 35:24.251
There are five other units here,

35:24.323 --> 35:27.292
and not one person even
remembers what you look like.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.191
Talk about being disconnected.

35:29.262 --> 35:32.857
- Are you sure you really want that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

35:34.167 --> 35:35.896
Next drawer on the left.

35:38.638 --> 35:41.232
There's a funnel in there too,
if you need it.

35:44.043 --> 35:46.170
- Check it out.
- What is it?

35:46.245 --> 35:47.371
New leads.

35:47.447 --> 35:49.711
Look, there's an address
written on here.

35:49.782 --> 35:52.376
I can't make that out.
Is that a five or a six?

35:52.452 --> 35:53.976
I think it's a...

35:54.053 --> 35:56.487
No, no, no, that's a five.
Definitely a five.

35:56.556 --> 36:00.151
So we have an address, a dry cleaning
ticket and a book of matches.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.625
You know what that means?

36:01.694 --> 36:04.993
- We could start a very small fire?
- There's still hope.

36:05.064 --> 36:08.158
Oh, yes, these pants were jet black.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.394
Armani, I believe.

36:09.469 --> 36:11.528
I remember them.
They were expensive.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.767
Do you remember anything else
about the woman? It's important.

36:14.841 --> 36:17.275
She's pleasant,
but a little dull maybe.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.537
- Dull?
- Dull?

36:18.611 --> 36:22.513
I think of her,
I think of sadness, loneliness.

36:22.582 --> 36:25.346
I don't need a psychological
profile from this guy.

36:25.418 --> 36:27.909
- Can we just get the pants?
- Can I get the pants?

36:27.987 --> 36:30.581
Item left too long.
We give them to homeless shelter.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.147
Are you insane? They were Armani.

36:33.226 --> 36:35.592
OK, let's go.

36:36.963 --> 36:38.225
Are you coming or not?

36:38.297 --> 36:40.424
They're pants,
what do you need 'em for?

36:50.543 --> 36:53.637
425, I think.

36:54.914 --> 36:57.644
- Look familiar?
- Not really.

37:03.990 --> 37:05.321
Hi.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.253
Hello.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.994
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.863
This might sound a little odd, but I was
wondering if you knew a certain woman.

37:14.934 --> 37:17.732
Blond, about five-foot-one...

37:17.803 --> 37:19.703
- Two. And a half.
- Two and a half?

37:19.772 --> 37:22.172
Oh, my God. Who are you?

37:22.241 --> 37:23.469
I don't know you. I...

37:23.543 --> 37:26.341
- Did my wife hire you?
- I'm sorry, what?

37:26.412 --> 37:28.073
I knew she'd find out.

37:28.147 --> 37:30.479
Whatever she's payin' you,
I'll double it.

37:30.550 --> 37:33.144
- Anything you want.
- I'm not looking for money.

37:33.219 --> 37:35.847
- Donald! Who is it?
- That's her. Come back around six.

37:35.922 --> 37:37.116
I'll have a check ready.

37:42.962 --> 37:44.452
Wow.

37:48.167 --> 37:51.330
What? You don't think I actually
had sex with that old horndog.

37:51.404 --> 37:55.170
- Kinda looks that way, Lizzie.
- It's Elizabeth. And that's disgusting.

37:55.241 --> 37:59.109
Well, look on the bright side.
At 6:00, I'm coming into some money.

38:02.915 --> 38:04.576
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.049
Oh, my God.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.785
Maybe I was a slut.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.794
A lonely, home-wrecking slut.

38:26.672 --> 38:30.904
So what if I was a slut? There's nothing
wrong with a healthy sexual appetite.

38:30.977 --> 38:31.966
Not at all.

38:32.044 --> 38:35.207
Look who I'm talking to,
Mr. Tried To Feel Me Up One Time.

38:35.281 --> 38:37.272
I'm trying to agree with you.

38:37.350 --> 38:38.942
- David.
- What?

38:39.018 --> 38:40.349
This is it.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.410
You recognize it? Good.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.012
OK. Come on.

38:49.962 --> 38:52.487
This is Moose's.
I love this restaurant.

38:52.565 --> 38:54.430
- You ate here a lot.
- No.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.899
- No.
- I never did.

38:55.968 --> 38:59.301
I remember looking in that window
and wishing I could eat in here.

38:59.372 --> 39:02.933
What, were you a homeless
street urchin? Why didn't you?

39:03.009 --> 39:05.500
I wanted to,
I just never got around to it.

39:06.779 --> 39:10.078
Maybe the dry-cleaner guy
was right about me.

39:10.149 --> 39:11.810
Hello, can I help you?

39:11.884 --> 39:14.250
No, thank you.
Maybe some other time.

39:15.121 --> 39:16.110
Kenny!

39:17.056 --> 39:19.354
Lvan, call 911,
we need an ambulance!

39:19.425 --> 39:21.052
- Are you OK?
- Undo his collar.

39:21.127 --> 39:22.924
- Is he breathing?
- I can't tell.

39:22.995 --> 39:26.328
- Maybe we should do mouth-to-mouth.
- God. We need a doctor.

39:26.399 --> 39:28.060
We really have to find a doctor.

39:28.134 --> 39:30.932
Is there a doctor here? Anyone?

39:31.003 --> 39:32.664
- Feel his chest.
- What?

39:32.738 --> 39:35.070
His chest,
check and see if it's bloated.

39:35.141 --> 39:36.938
- How would I know?
- Just do it!

39:37.843 --> 39:41.006
Excuse me. Pardon me.
I need to feel his chest.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.377
Can you feel his ribs?

39:42.448 --> 39:44.643
No, but I can if I press down.

39:44.717 --> 39:47.015
- What are you doing?
- Does he feel bloated?

39:47.086 --> 39:48.485
- I think so.
- Think what?

39:48.554 --> 39:52.046
Tell them you'll need a sharp
paring knife and a bottle of vodka.

39:52.124 --> 39:54.558
I need a sharp paring knife
and a bottle of vodka.

39:54.627 --> 39:55.719
- Ivan?
- Yeah, got it.

39:55.795 --> 39:58.161
- What's wrong?
- It's a tension pneumothorax.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.460
- It's a tension nemothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

40:00.533 --> 40:02.194
- Pneumothaxer.
- Pneumothorax.

40:02.268 --> 40:03.565
- Pneumathurman.
- Never mind.

40:03.636 --> 40:06.298
- Never mind!
- But what is it?

40:06.372 --> 40:08.636
Air is escaping
out of the lungs into his chest.

40:08.708 --> 40:10.437
...out of his lungs into his chest.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.136
- Open his shirt.
- Open his shirt.

40:12.211 --> 40:13.678
- No, you do it.
- I'll do it.

40:13.746 --> 40:16.738
A valve at the opening of the lungs.
If it doesn't close,

40:16.816 --> 40:20.047
it constricts the lungs
and compresses the organs.

40:20.119 --> 40:23.247
I want you to feel for his ribs
again. A little bit lower.

40:23.322 --> 40:25.620
The spot between two ribs,
do you feel that?

40:25.691 --> 40:27.750
OK, splash some vodka on it.

40:27.827 --> 40:30.159
- All right. Get the knife.
- OK.

40:32.131 --> 40:35.032
Can I ask everyone just
to stand back a little bit here?

40:35.101 --> 40:38.264
A little bit further, please.
A little bit further. Thank you.

40:38.337 --> 40:41.272
- What am I doing with the knife?
- Make an incision.

40:41.340 --> 40:43.467
You know what? No.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.943
- David, this man's life is at stake.
- I... I can't stab a man.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.207
OK. There's nothing to be afraid of.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.681
You're gonna make
a hole for the air to escape.

40:51.751 --> 40:53.946
So put the knife on that spot.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.748
Oh, my God.
How do you know this?

40:55.821 --> 40:59.154
I don't know, I just do. Now do it!
Put the knife there.

40:59.225 --> 41:01.853
Now, you're gonna need
to push harder than that.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.588
- A little bit harder.
- Oh, God!

41:03.662 --> 41:05.220
OK! OK, good! That's enough.

41:05.297 --> 41:08.289
All right, now, take the pourer
out of the vodka bottle.

41:08.367 --> 41:10.301
- What?
- You're doing good. Now...

41:10.369 --> 41:11.427
Hold on.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.806
- Go.
- Put the pourer in the hole you made.

41:17.877 --> 41:18.866
What?

41:18.944 --> 41:21.674
It's gonna keep the wound open
so air can escape. Do it!

41:21.747 --> 41:23.738
- I can't.
- Do it.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.887
- He's breathing.
- He's breathing!

41:28.954 --> 41:30.581
He's breathing!

41:30.656 --> 41:32.089
I'm a doctor.

41:32.158 --> 41:33.250
I'm a doctor!

41:33.325 --> 41:36.988
I know. Thank God. The ambulance
will be here right away.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.189
Ask him where the nearest hospital is.

41:39.265 --> 41:41.324
Do you know where
the nearest hospital is?

41:41.400 --> 41:42.890
A few blocks, St. Matthews.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.959
- Thank you.
- St. Matthews?

41:45.037 --> 41:48.404
I may have been a home-wrecking
whore, but I saved lives.

41:48.474 --> 41:51.739
I worked in that hospital.
I know it, it sounds so familiar.

41:51.811 --> 41:54.405
- I've never saved a life before.
- It's the best.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.745
One minute you're looking at
this monitor, it says "game over,"

41:57.817 --> 42:00.411
then you bring it back,
a little blip and it's there!

42:00.486 --> 42:03.319
- What's that?
- That's just a little blood.

42:06.425 --> 42:07.414
David?

42:13.098 --> 42:15.760
- I work here.
- You did?

42:15.835 --> 42:18.668
The receptionist, her name is Amita.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.329
It's all coming back to me now.

42:20.406 --> 42:22.374
There's Bill and Karen

42:22.441 --> 42:24.875
and Michael and...

42:24.944 --> 42:28.277
Elizabeth? You mean Elizabeth Masterson?

42:28.347 --> 42:32.283
- Masterson. Yes, that's my name.
- Yes, that's it. Elizabeth Masterson.

42:33.652 --> 42:36.314
Dr. Masterson is...

42:36.388 --> 42:40.154
...is not active on our staff right now.

42:40.226 --> 42:42.558
Hold on. Let me talk to someone.

42:44.430 --> 42:45.522
Excuse me, doctor?

42:45.598 --> 42:47.190
Oh, no, she's got the tone.

42:47.266 --> 42:48.699
- What tone?
- The tone.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.463
You're trying to pass the buck
onto somebody else

42:51.537 --> 42:53.528
to tell you your friend died!

42:53.606 --> 42:55.403
Excuse me, sir.

42:55.474 --> 42:59.205
I need you to go to
the third-floor nurses' station.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.878
Oh, no, it's Fran. She's my mentor.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.042
They wouldn't send us
here if it wasn't bad.

43:06.118 --> 43:07.346
- Mr. Abbott?
- Hi, yes.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.943
- Fran Lo.
- Nice to meet you.

43:09.021 --> 43:11.819
You've been inquiring
about Elizabeth Masterson?

43:11.891 --> 43:14.655
Right. Could you tell me
what happened to her?

43:14.727 --> 43:17.025
I need to know
your relationship with her.

43:17.096 --> 43:20.327
Tell her you're my boyfriend.
She can't tell you anything

43:20.399 --> 43:22.959
unless she knows
we're intimately connected.

43:23.035 --> 43:25.936
We were romantic with each other.

43:26.005 --> 43:28.906
- What do you mean?
- You know, boyfriend-girlfriend.

43:28.974 --> 43:31.033
I know what romantic means,

43:31.110 --> 43:34.045
but I... I have
a hard time believing that.

43:34.113 --> 43:36.047
- What? Why?
- What? Why?

43:36.115 --> 43:38.777
Elizabeth's whole life
was this hospital.

43:38.851 --> 43:40.375
"Was"? Did she say "was"?

43:40.452 --> 43:42.920
I don't know of a single date
she'd ever been on.

43:42.988 --> 43:46.549
We were fairly recent.
I live in her apartment...

43:46.625 --> 43:48.217
- David.
- Building.

43:48.294 --> 43:51.195
So, you don't know about the accident.

43:51.263 --> 43:53.254
Accident.

43:54.466 --> 43:57.060
Oh, God, David. I remember it.

43:58.203 --> 43:59.431
It was awful.

44:00.306 --> 44:02.570
I was... I've been away.

44:02.641 --> 44:04.871
It was three months ago.

44:04.944 --> 44:07.344
Three months.

44:07.413 --> 44:09.438
I'm sorry.

44:09.515 --> 44:13.281
I was away for awhile
on a business trip.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.647
Oh, my God.

44:54.193 --> 44:56.286
What was that?
You were, like, flying.

44:58.497 --> 45:01.660
Oh, my God. It's you.

45:03.469 --> 45:05.266
It's you, it's really you.

45:05.337 --> 45:07.737
You're... you're not dead,
you're alive.

45:07.806 --> 45:10.502
I know, David, but I'm in a coma.
This is not good.

45:10.576 --> 45:12.373
Well, it's way better than dead.

45:12.444 --> 45:14.844
Look at you.
Your body is healing, it's...

45:14.913 --> 45:17.814
You don't have any scars.
You look pretty.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.682
It doesn't matter how I look.

45:21.754 --> 45:24.279
Three months,
that's a persistent coma.

45:24.356 --> 45:26.517
We're here now.
Let's do something.

45:26.592 --> 45:27.991
Like what?

45:28.060 --> 45:31.154
Like... I don't know.
You're the doctor.

45:31.230 --> 45:33.164
Right. Right.

45:35.567 --> 45:37.000
- Forget it.
- What?

45:37.069 --> 45:38.434
I was gonna say that we...

45:38.504 --> 45:41.530
I need to find a way
to put myself together again.

45:41.607 --> 45:44.974
OK, good, good. That's great.
How do we do that?

45:45.044 --> 45:47.103
Maybe I should try this.

45:52.184 --> 45:53.549
Something's happening!

45:53.619 --> 45:55.746
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think it's working!

45:55.821 --> 45:58.051
Yeah? No.

45:58.123 --> 45:59.852
Let me try again.

45:59.925 --> 46:01.358
I mean, really focus on it.

46:01.427 --> 46:03.395
Hold on inside there.

46:07.332 --> 46:08.993
I'm not sticking.

46:09.068 --> 46:11.730
It's like I'm no longer
connected to this body.

46:11.804 --> 46:15.001
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Turn around.

46:15.074 --> 46:17.008
- What?
- I want to try something.

46:17.076 --> 46:18.407
OK.

46:25.551 --> 46:26.609
You felt that.

46:26.685 --> 46:27.879
My hand tingled.

46:27.953 --> 46:30.547
You are still connected to your body.

46:30.622 --> 46:32.180
The monitor doesn't agree.

46:32.257 --> 46:33.884
Machines don't know everything.

46:33.959 --> 46:36.257
Everything in my training
tells me they do.

46:36.328 --> 46:38.353
Then how are we having
this conversation?

46:38.430 --> 46:40.694
I don't know.

46:40.766 --> 46:43.633
Mr. Abbott? I'm sorry.
I have an appointment,

46:43.702 --> 46:46.262
and I can't leave you here unattended.

46:46.338 --> 46:48.829
Can I just have a couple
more minutes, please?

46:48.907 --> 46:50.101
I'm saying goodbye.

46:50.175 --> 46:52.302
- Of course.
- Thank you.

46:52.377 --> 46:54.902
My nieces must have
made these things for me.

46:54.980 --> 46:57.949
Wow, that's an amazing likeness.

46:59.818 --> 47:01.877
Look at this.

47:01.954 --> 47:04.616
That's the picture
from my nightstand.

47:04.690 --> 47:06.157
Abby must have brought it.

47:06.225 --> 47:07.522
You look great.

47:10.796 --> 47:12.195
Look at me now.

47:13.599 --> 47:16.193
These levels aren't changing, David.

47:16.268 --> 47:18.259
If anything, they're decreasing.

47:21.106 --> 47:23.836
- I'm gonna have to leave soon.
- All right.

47:23.909 --> 47:26.571
Want me to wait
downstairs in the lobby?

47:26.645 --> 47:29.842
No, no, that's sweet.
You should go.

47:29.915 --> 47:31.542
Thank you for helping me.

47:31.617 --> 47:33.812
It was my pleasure.

47:34.820 --> 47:37.618
Are you sure you don't want
to come back with me?

47:37.689 --> 47:40.157
After all,
it is your apartment. It's fine.

47:41.226 --> 47:44.161
After I made it here, I...

47:44.229 --> 47:47.027
...can't imagine
leaving myself, you know?

47:47.099 --> 47:48.589
OK, I know, I just...

47:48.667 --> 47:50.999
It just feels weird
leaving you here alone.

47:52.237 --> 47:54.205
I don't know where else I belong.

47:54.273 --> 47:57.674
Mr. Abbott. I'm sorry.

48:01.547 --> 48:03.344
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.782
Goodbye.

48:15.327 --> 48:17.454
Oh, I hate this.

48:17.529 --> 48:19.588
She finally gets a life, and then...

48:19.665 --> 48:21.565
You know what?
That guy was cute.

48:21.633 --> 48:24.602
At least she got a chance
to hang with him for a little while.

48:24.670 --> 48:27.833
Yeah. It woulda been awful
if she'd gone through her whole life

48:27.906 --> 48:30.807
not knowing what it was all about.

48:46.992 --> 48:49.552
Oh, my God. Jenny?

48:49.628 --> 48:52.620
No wonder
I could never find you.

49:00.172 --> 49:01.662
I guess you got my job.

49:01.740 --> 49:05.232
Yeah. I think I've earned it.
I deserve it.

49:05.310 --> 49:07.278
Everything
you thought it would be?

49:07.346 --> 49:11.180
It is. And it's time to upgrade
from the 330 to the 740.

49:11.250 --> 49:13.775
I'm goin' to the dealer tonight.

49:13.852 --> 49:16.320
Hold on. It's Walsh,
I have to take this.

49:16.388 --> 49:17.719
Hello?

49:17.789 --> 49:20.121
Really? You want me to do it?

49:21.526 --> 49:23.118
Sure, of course I can.

49:28.533 --> 49:31.468
Dude, did you know I can get
a built-in jack for my iPod?

49:31.536 --> 49:33.970
Did you know there's
people out there dying?

49:34.039 --> 49:37.202
- I'm in a coma, have you noticed?
- I know. Sweet!

49:45.050 --> 49:47.610
Zoe? Lily Vanilli?

49:48.787 --> 49:51.620
Oh, my God,
you guys got so big!

49:53.892 --> 49:55.086
Beat ya!

49:55.160 --> 49:56.821
- Did not!
- Did too!

49:56.895 --> 49:58.487
- Did not!
- Did too!

49:58.563 --> 49:59.655
Did not!
Did too!

49:59.731 --> 50:01.665
How could I feel him
and not you guys?

50:01.733 --> 50:03.098
- Did not!
- Did too!

50:03.168 --> 50:05.500
- Oh, that's funny.
- Abby.

50:05.570 --> 50:07.902
I remember saying
no running, no screaming!

50:07.973 --> 50:10.771
- Abby, can you feel me?
- All right, chill, I'm serious.

50:10.842 --> 50:12.275
I guess not.

50:12.344 --> 50:15.177
- I hope you feel better.
- Get well soon.

50:15.247 --> 50:16.509
I love you.

50:16.581 --> 50:19.049
I remember when you pushed us...

50:19.117 --> 50:21.176
It's so sweet you guys
come and visit me.

50:21.253 --> 50:23.915
- And I really miss...
- Excuse me.

50:23.989 --> 50:25.650
- Mrs. Brody, hi.
- Hi.

50:25.724 --> 50:28.454
Dr. Rushton.
Could I have a quick word?

50:28.527 --> 50:31.189
- Sure.
- What do you want?

50:31.263 --> 50:34.721
First of all, I hope you know how much
we all love and miss Elizabeth.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.325
Please. He's doing
high fives he's not in Phoenix.

50:37.402 --> 50:40.064
Because she was
a senior resident here,

50:40.138 --> 50:42.333
we've taken some
extraordinary measures

50:42.407 --> 50:45.706
to make her feel more comfortable
these last three months.

50:45.777 --> 50:48.143
Lily! Turn it back!

50:48.213 --> 50:49.703
Zoe, what did we talk about?

50:49.781 --> 50:51.840
Watch your sister. Sorry.

50:53.285 --> 50:55.048
This is hard to say.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.714
When we come to work here,

50:57.789 --> 50:59.848
we are asked to sign release forms.

50:59.925 --> 51:01.153
OK.

51:01.226 --> 51:02.853
I don't like the sound of this.

51:02.928 --> 51:06.489
Did you know your sister's opinion
about artificially prolonging life?

51:08.166 --> 51:10.066
- No.
- She was against it.

51:10.135 --> 51:11.193
Really?

51:11.269 --> 51:13.829
OK, that was before.
I am completely for it now.

51:13.905 --> 51:17.102
Honestly, most in our
profession feel that way.

51:17.175 --> 51:19.700
Not me! I'm perfectly happy.

51:19.778 --> 51:21.109
Come on, Abby!

51:21.179 --> 51:23.306
You have got to feel me,
I'm your sister!

51:23.382 --> 51:26.215
But there's still some
brain activity, isn't there?

51:26.284 --> 51:28.479
People have woken up
from this kind of coma.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.851
- All the time.
- Not on any record I've found.

51:30.922 --> 51:34.858
Of course they have!
Otherwise, what am I doing here?

51:34.926 --> 51:37.156
I feel car sick.

51:37.229 --> 51:40.062
- What are you doing?
- We're looking for the stick.

51:40.132 --> 51:41.121
What stick?

51:41.199 --> 51:44.327
- You said she had a stick up her...
- Stop it! Come on.

51:44.403 --> 51:47.065
TV is going to become
a very dim memory for you two.

51:47.139 --> 51:49.403
Mrs. Brody,
Elizabeth did sign a release.

51:49.474 --> 51:51.442
Because of the special situation,

51:51.510 --> 51:55.105
we won't take any terminal action
without your explicit approval.

51:55.180 --> 51:57.239
Now, I've prepared this paperwork...

51:57.315 --> 51:58.748
Don't sign that. I'm here!

51:58.817 --> 52:01.377
...if you decide to sign...
- I'll think about it.

52:01.453 --> 52:04.217
Abby, I'll baby-sit more, I swear!

52:04.289 --> 52:06.189
Those jeans you love?
They're yours!

52:06.258 --> 52:08.249
We sometimes find that it's easier

52:08.326 --> 52:11.659
just to ask God's forgiveness
and not prolong the inevitable.

52:11.730 --> 52:13.220
I said I'd think about it.

52:15.033 --> 52:16.967
Thank you, Abby.

52:17.035 --> 52:18.900
You always looked out for me.

52:30.849 --> 52:32.248
You here?

52:36.788 --> 52:38.187
I guess not.

53:34.913 --> 53:36.710
I'm locked out.

53:57.636 --> 54:01.003
Doesn't this location
make San Francisco bearable?

54:01.072 --> 54:03.870
Wait, you're not from here,
are you? Oh, good.

54:03.942 --> 54:06.536
And what's with all
the single men in this town?

54:06.611 --> 54:10.240
Every time I meet
a good-looking guy... lesbian.

54:10.315 --> 54:11.748
It's tough.

54:11.816 --> 54:14.876
I'd get on the phone and I'd be like,

54:14.953 --> 54:16.887
"Hello? Osama?

54:16.955 --> 54:18.889
Communism is so over.

54:18.957 --> 54:21.391
Like, give your people toilet paper."

54:21.459 --> 54:23.393
So, like, if I had to choose?

54:23.461 --> 54:24.951
If I had to choose.

54:26.631 --> 54:27.962
Wow.

54:29.234 --> 54:31.498
I guess I'd have to go
with the midget.

54:31.570 --> 54:33.629
I'm sorry...

54:34.406 --> 54:36.738
The locksmith,
does he know to ring my unit?

54:38.843 --> 54:40.174
I think so.

54:41.713 --> 54:42.975
Where's your bathroom?

54:43.048 --> 54:45.539
- It's right down the hall there.
- OK.

54:57.862 --> 54:59.193
- Elizabeth!
- Yeah.

54:59.264 --> 55:02.097
No, I just... I didn't think
you were gonna come back.

55:02.167 --> 55:05.432
I thought you were gonna stay
at the hospital with your body.

55:05.503 --> 55:08.666
It's terrible. They're trying
to get my sister to sign papers

55:08.740 --> 55:11.800
authorizing permission
to take me off of life support.

55:11.876 --> 55:14.606
- No! What? They can't do that!
- I know. I said that.

55:14.679 --> 55:15.941
Nobody could hear me.

55:16.014 --> 55:17.948
And I just wanted to talk to you.

55:18.016 --> 55:20.280
- David!
- Just a minute!

55:20.352 --> 55:23.480
Well, that didn't take very long.

55:23.555 --> 55:24.954
No.

55:25.023 --> 55:26.752
No, she barged in.

55:26.825 --> 55:28.918
She got locked out of her apartment.

55:28.994 --> 55:32.452
- You don't have to explain. I get it.
- No, you don't get anything.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.054
She's using the bathroom...

55:34.132 --> 55:36.566
Her voice sounded
like it came from the bedroom.

55:36.635 --> 55:37.829
It did?

55:38.203 --> 55:41.001
Come here.
I want to show you something.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.900
When you know, you know, right?

55:43.975 --> 55:46.603
I had no idea that's...

55:46.678 --> 55:48.839
You had no idea
she was naked on your bed.

55:48.913 --> 55:50.244
No.

55:52.183 --> 55:54.242
You're wondering
what she looks like.

55:54.319 --> 55:55.616
- No, I'm not.
- A little?

55:55.687 --> 55:57.450
Not enough to go look.

55:57.522 --> 55:59.820
Tell you what.
I'll do a little recon for ya.

55:59.891 --> 56:02.519
- Please don't!
- Don't worry. I'm a doctor.

56:02.594 --> 56:06.086
- Elizabeth. No, no, no, no, no.
- Relax.

56:08.867 --> 56:10.596
She's got a tattoo on her ass.

56:12.737 --> 56:14.034
It says "All aboard."

56:14.105 --> 56:16.471
- Really?
- In three languages.

56:16.541 --> 56:18.873
- Oh, that's funny.
- She's very cultural.

56:18.943 --> 56:20.535
You know, you sound jealous.

56:20.612 --> 56:22.477
- Oh, please.
- You do.

56:22.547 --> 56:24.674
Are you talkin' to someone?

56:25.417 --> 56:28.648
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Eyes up top, David.

56:29.821 --> 56:31.516
Nothing.

56:31.589 --> 56:34.649
Look, I'm sorry if I'm coming on
a little too strong.

56:34.726 --> 56:36.717
That's just my style.

56:36.795 --> 56:38.490
I hear you sometimes.

56:38.563 --> 56:41.430
Up here...

56:41.499 --> 56:43.160
...by yourself...

56:44.836 --> 56:47.168
And I just figured...

56:47.238 --> 56:48.967
...maybe he's lonely.

56:49.040 --> 56:50.632
I know I am.

56:51.476 --> 56:54.036
Is it wrong for me
to want to touch someone?

56:54.112 --> 56:55.773
To be close?

56:55.847 --> 56:59.044
Feel a warm body next to me?

56:59.117 --> 57:01.085
David, just do it.

57:01.152 --> 57:02.210
What?

57:02.287 --> 57:05.222
Go ahead, be with her.
It's what you both want.

57:05.290 --> 57:08.123
- No, it isn't.
- Are you all right?

57:08.693 --> 57:12.185
Do you... wanna take
some kind of medication first?

57:12.263 --> 57:13.525
It's cool if you do.

57:13.598 --> 57:15.725
David, it's OK.

57:15.800 --> 57:18.792
She's beautiful, and she's
right here in front of you.

57:18.870 --> 57:21.202
- And I'm in the way.
- No, you're not.

57:21.272 --> 57:24.139
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

57:29.547 --> 57:31.208
It's Katrina.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.985
That was quick.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.927
Come on, nothing happened.

57:51.801 --> 57:53.928
What'd you say to her?

57:56.339 --> 57:58.068
That I was seeing someone.

57:59.676 --> 58:01.268
Honestly?

58:01.745 --> 58:05.442
Well, I didn't mention
that I was the only person who could.

58:11.021 --> 58:12.750
You know, I haven't...

58:14.090 --> 58:16.490
...haven't really been
with anyone since...

58:16.559 --> 58:18.220
...since Laura.

58:20.630 --> 58:22.825
She was cursing at her shoe.

58:24.067 --> 58:25.796
Her heel had broken.

58:28.838 --> 58:32.035
And then she just kinda sat down

58:32.108 --> 58:34.338
and put her hand to her head.

58:34.411 --> 58:36.538
Cerebral hemorrhage?

58:41.318 --> 58:43.309
And...

58:47.123 --> 58:49.114
I couldn't do anything to help her.

58:50.193 --> 58:51.922
She was, like, gone.

58:51.995 --> 58:54.725
I couldn't even say goodbye,
and she was just...

58:55.465 --> 58:56.864
She's gone.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.069
What was she like?

59:06.142 --> 59:09.077
You know, she was just
a big pain in the ass.

59:09.879 --> 59:11.278
No, really.

59:11.348 --> 59:14.283
I mean, the bras on the doorknobs,

59:14.351 --> 59:18.151
leaving the car with the...
with the gas needle below empty.

59:18.221 --> 59:21.349
She couldn't put gas in the car.
It was impossible for her.

59:21.424 --> 59:25.986
And just total stubborn inability
to master a remote.

59:26.062 --> 59:28.394
So she would just
randomly click buttons,

59:28.465 --> 59:32.458
until the TV was snarled into
some unmanageable condition.

59:32.535 --> 59:35.060
I mean, I'm so...

59:35.138 --> 59:37.231
I'm mad just thinking...

59:40.577 --> 59:41.908
...thinking about her.

59:44.848 --> 59:46.509
I'm sorry, David.

59:48.251 --> 59:51.448
Your sister really wouldn't
sign those papers, would she?

59:51.521 --> 59:53.512
I don't know.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.252
I hope not.

59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.588
Won't even matter
if I don't wake up soon.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:03.291
My brain activity's
decreasing every day.

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:05.459
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.628
You're kind of a smarty-pants.

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:10.498
No, it'll bring you down to my level.

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:13.701
You're not dumb, David,
just a little lazy.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.836
Cute, but lazy.

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.038
Thank you.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.343
I wasn't always like this, you know.

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.179
What were you like?

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:29.221
Come on.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.157
I want to show you something.

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.830
- Where are we?
- It's an estate.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.967
The guy's in Hawaii this time of year.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:50.444
- Are we trespassing?
- Don't worry, we're not going inside.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.812
Here it is.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.590
You said you love gardens.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.250
What is this place?

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.385
I made this place.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.197
This is my work.

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:13.331
I was a landscape architect.
I had my own company for awhile.

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.034
David, I've been here before.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.133
What do you mean?

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.541
I know this is gonna
sound really strange,

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.136
but I dreamed of this place.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:28.607
These flowers, everything.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:31.750
It's beautiful.

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.085
I had no idea, David.

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.887
What a joy it must be
to create a place like this.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.393
Yeah, it was.

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.987
Is it gonna be again?

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.657
Sure.

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.224
Promise?

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:05.887
Who the hell's calling me?

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.422
Hello?

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:08.889
David, it's Grace.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.189
Well, you are the luckiest man
in San Francisco.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.730
Thank you. Why do you say that?

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.765
Great news, the apartment is yours.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.461
And they're willing
to give you a nice long lease.

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:20.867
How long a lease?

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:23.064
Really long.
And I'm gonna send it over,

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.835
- and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.968
Why are they giving me
a long lease now?

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:31.411
It's a terrible story. The tenant
was in some kind of coma,

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.177
and it is what it is,
so they're gonna pull the plug.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.277
But get this: They are gonna
throw in that couch you like.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.584
- David?
- What?

01:02:40.657 --> 01:02:42.284
We gotta go talk to your sister.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.189
Why? What are you gonna say to her?

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.592
I don't know. What kind of dirt
do you have on her?

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:48.494
Her middle name is Ellen.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:52.296
In the third grade she told everybody
it was Leia, like Princess Leia.

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:53.562
What else?

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.771
She's lactose intolerant.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.898
All right, the only way
this is gonna work

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:01.535
is if I could tell her something
that only you know.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.375
Something so intimate, so personal...

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:08.383
She French-kissed her ex-boyfriend J.J.
Five minutes before her wedding.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.112
Oh, that'll work. That's good.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:13.314
- Nobody knows that.
- That... I think I like her already.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:23.764
So, how did you know Elizabeth?
You must've worked together.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:27.792
- God knows she wasn't dating anybody.
- Everybody likes to rub that one in.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.135
Actually, this is gonna be
a little difficult to swallow...

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.265
Tea!

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:35.175
My nieces are here?
They're supposed to be at school.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.109
- Hi.
- Would you like some tea, sir?

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.807
Well, yes, thank you, madam.

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.476
Abort. Don't do this in front of them,
it's gonna freak them out.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.487
I'm sorry, you were saying?
How did you know her?

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.580
- Lie your butt off.
- We worked together.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.851
- No!
- No.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.088
No, no, no. You're not credible
as a doctor. Make something up.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.562
I mean, I didn't work with her.
We worked together on my illness.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.929
I was a patient of hers.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.264
Lily? Can you see me?

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:02.133
I was sick. I had meningitis.

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.968
Spiral meningitis.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.371
I'm so sorry.

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.466
Spiral meningitis?
It's not a disease.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.977
Oh, no, it's OK.
I'm much better now.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.035
I...

01:04:11.114 --> 01:04:13.241
Elizabeth, she believed in me,

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:16.717
believed that I would recover
when nobody else did.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.253
And then I did.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:20.255
That sounds just like her.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:23.156
But why are you telling me this?

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:28.195
Because I know about
Elizabeth's situation,

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:30.858
and I just wanna say that...

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.560
Lily.

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:35.570
...there are things...
- You know I'm here, don't you?

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.230
...sometimes that...

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.604
...that are beyond our understanding.

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.369
And so, I just wanted to ask you...

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:47.541
Actually, I just want to beg you

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:50.381
to... to give her
a little bit more time.

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.751
She's gonna pull through this thing.

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.312
I just know it.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.381
That's really sweet of you to say,

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.587
but... it's kinda too late.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.754
Abby.

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:03.094
- What do you mean?
- Abby, what did you do?

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.499
It's David, right?

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:10.705
You see, it's too late because
I've already signed the papers.

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:13.298
Abby. I'm here.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.241
Can you feel me? I'm right here.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:18.041
We're terminating life support
tomorrow at noon,

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:20.378
while the girls are in school.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.510
I mean, the past three months
have been so hard on them,

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.076
on this whole family.

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.145
Well, I understand that. I really do.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.714
But I think you're makin'
a grave mistake here,

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:33.193
- because I really believe...
- It's for the best. Really.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.820
This is what Elizabeth wanted.

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:39.657
I mean, I spent my whole life thinking
I knew what was best for her.

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:43.228
What she should wear,
what men she should date.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.101
This is the last thing
Elizabeth asked for.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:52.278
And for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna respect her wishes.

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:56.549
Oh, Abby.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.018
Look.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.784
This is gonna sound
really strange to you, but...

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:02.847
Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:05.553
...the truth is Elizabeth
is here with us right now.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:10.088
She came here with me, she's standing
next to you, begging you to wait.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.031
Right next to me?

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.092
- Right there.
- David, stop.

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.365
No, let me do this.
I don't know how or why,

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.737
but somehow I can see
your sister's spirit.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.800
I know it's crazy,
but I also can talk to her.

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:25.279
So why don't I have her just
explain the whole thing to you,

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:26.645
and I'll translate.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.847
Could you just hold on, just a sec?

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.852
OK, tea party's over.
Time for Wiggly Safari!

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:39.485
Yeah!

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:43.589
- OK, David, this could work.
- I think I was getting through to her.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:47.067
- You need to get her to the hospital.
- Right to the hospital.

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:51.072
- We'll get her to rip those papers...
- Get the hell outta here, you freak!

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:54.375
I'm not makin' this up!
Why would I?

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:56.274
Abby, calm down,
just calm down!

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:58.643
I'll chop you!
I swear, I will chop you!

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:00.477
- Tell about J.J.
- I know about J.J.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:03.075
- What?
- I know what you did with J.J.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.712
I'll tell everybody.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.881
How do you know that?
Nobody knows that!

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:09.925
Get outta here! Get going!

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.033
You kids OK?

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.560
Mommy, is Auntie Elizabeth
gonna have more tea?

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.838
What?

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:42.382
I don't think your sister's
a very spiritual person.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.982
She's just bein' a good mom.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.585
Tryin' to keep her kids away
from a crazy guy.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.599
I think I would have liked
to have been a mom.

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.136
You'd make a good one.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:57.363
Thanks.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.569
Guess I'll never really know.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.408
Come on, Lizzie. This can't be it.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.471
- Lizzie?
- OK, I'm sorry.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.676
I know you don't like
to be called that.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:09.979
I'm warming up to it.

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:12.787
I can go to that hospital.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.255
I could talk to your friend, Fran.
I could...

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:17.519
- No, David.
...talk to the asshole guy.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:20.823
Brett? No. Just stop,
They'll put you in a straitjacket.

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:24.024
There's no way anyone's
gonna believe I'm still here.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.330
Your niece, the little girl.
She saw you.

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.663
Oh, great.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.966
My fate's in the hands
of a four-year-old

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.234
who has seven other
imaginary friends.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.233
Wait. There is someone else.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.710
What do you mean?

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.109
Come on.

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.743
- Darryl!
- Dude.

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.615
- Yeah.
- The spirit's with you, isn't it?

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:47.281
You can't bring that here.
What are you thinking?

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:50.792
- You were right. She's alive.
- Righteous.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.795
She's in a coma. Her family's
gonna take her off life support.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.558
Not so righteous.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.930
So, what, are you guys
socializing now?

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.993
We've... acclimated.

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.062
Yeah, I can tell.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:09.803
In fact, I'm sensin' some pretty
intense feelings she has for you, bro.

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.746
- Really?
- No, I don't.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.807
Major red aura.
Somebody's embarrassed.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:18.786
- I am not. Can we focus here?
- OK.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:22.290
- Ask him if there's a spell...
- Or a chant. Anything to get...

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.417
- My spirit...
...back into her body?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:28.054
- You're asking the wrong question.
- Why is that wrong?

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.095
Look, I have the gift.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.862
I didn't ask for it, but I do.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.630
I can sense these things,

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.638
spirits, whatever
you wanna call 'em.

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:39.037
Why they're hangin' here
in the first place?

01:09:39.108 --> 01:09:42.669
- That's their unfinished business.
- Do I have the gift?

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:45.908
Dude, please.
You definitely don't have it.

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:47.313
You're a civilian.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:50.648
But if I don't have it,
how is it that I can see her

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.688
and talk to her
when no one else can?

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:55.622
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.489
That's the right question.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.825
What the hell is he talking about?

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.387
God, I feel like it's
right there in front of us.

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:05.195
I just can't get a handle on it.

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:08.725
How do you solve a problem
that isn't possible in the first place?

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:11.864
Because nothing seems
impossible to me anymore.

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:15.536
I mean, why did I move into
your apartment in the first place?

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:17.943
Why can I see you
when no one else can?

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:21.472
I mean, why was I down in that
restaurant when that guy collapsed?

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:24.815
It all seems interrelated somehow.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.821
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.687
I feel like I missed something here.
Wait a second.

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.592
Rosemary Preston lives
right here in San Francisco.

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.889
We could go talk to her.

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:36.431
I'll call Information,
maybe she's listed.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.727
Where did you get this?

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.893
It was just at the hospital.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.170
Yeah. I...

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.308
I took it.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.178
I'm sorry. I...

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.578
I just...

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.912
I wanted to have a picture of you.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:58.881
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna ever see you again.

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:00.546
I'm sorry.

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.322
Don't be sorry.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:07.986
That's really nice.

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:11.724
I really like that picture.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.202
Yeah. Yeah, I liked it too.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:19.269
I had just gotten
my MCAT scores back.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.468
Well, you must've done well.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:24.945
No, actually, I bombed.
My scores were so low

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:27.676
I couldn't even get into
correspondence school.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.048
- And that's a good thing?
- No.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.418
I know it sounds kinda crazy.
I wanted to go back to the library

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:36.219
and start studying immediately,
but Abby said no.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.556
The only thing to do
was to burn my scores

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.686
and drink margaritas.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.621
Lots and lots of margaritas.

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.293
Well, looks like she was right.

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:51.772
It's just funny because the one time
I completely failed at something,

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.173
I had more fun
than I'd ever had in my life.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.639
You look happy.

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:01.576
I was happy.

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:05.514
But what was I doing
with the rest of my time?

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.216
When I think about my life and I...

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:11.459
All I can remember is working.

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.990
You know? Working and working

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.828
and trying so hard.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.765
And for what?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.894
You help people.

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.272
You save lives.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.934
Yeah. Including my own.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:30.069
I saved my life, for later.

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.477
I just...

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.280
I never thought
there wouldn't be a later.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.844
No, don't say that.
There's still time.

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.480
We're gonna see this lady...

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:44.890
You know, I just don't want
to spend my last night crying.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:48.290
Or... fighting my fate.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:52.089
I wanna do something with you.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.500
OK. OK, great.

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:58.835
What do you want to do?

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:00.375
You want to fly to Paris?

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.501
See the Eiffel Tower? No problem.

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:05.570
You wanna dance on a beach
in Bali? Let's go! Let's do it!

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.842
Anywhere in the world

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:09.908
that will take MasterCard or Visa.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.316
Anywhere.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.854
There is something
that I would like to do.

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.725
Anything.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.861
I'm so bad at this.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.323
What? What is it?

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.537
Are you nervous?

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.873
- A little.
- Why?

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.348
I don't know.

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:46.687
How can you be nervous
when I can't even touch you?

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:50.691
I think I'm more nervous
because you can't touch me.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.791
Why?

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:57.960
You know in the hospital
when you touched my hand?

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.801
I felt it.

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:04.202
I mean, my spirit felt it.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.264
I don't know how.

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:11.012
But I think if you could
ever really touch me...

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:15.312
...I might wake up from all of this.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.803
I can almost feel that.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.202
Me too.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:41.603
I think I know what
my unfinished business is.

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.110
What?

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:46.606
You.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.107
Elizabeth.

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.271
Elizabeth?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.813
- Elizabeth?!
- I'm right here.

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:21.372
Oh, good, good.
I thought you were gone.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.418
Suddenly I know
what I'm supposed to do,

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:25.316
because this time
I can do something.

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:27.014
What are you talking about?

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:30.786
Lizzie, when we first met,
I kept saying that you were dead.

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:33.589
But it was me that was dead,
and you brought me back.

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.857
You saved me.

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.694
And now it's my turn to save you.

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:39.393
How?

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.561
I'm gonna steal your body.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.964
David.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.874
David. David, what are you thinking?
You can't do this!

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.242
- Why can't I?
- Because you'll go to jail.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.544
So? If something happens to you,
you think I care where I'll be?

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.414
At least this'll buy us
a little more time.

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:01.953
The things you'd have to know
to even start to pull this off...

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.288
You know them.
You'll talk me through it.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.557
OK, you're gonna need a van.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:10.427
And somebody with no morals.

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.165
- What are we movin' again?
- Medical supplies.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.336
You didn't tell him? You have to.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.403
You know,
he looks really familiar to me.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.279
- You saw him at the bar.
- Saw who at the bar?

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.113
No one, never mind.
Here we go!

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:35.612
OK, and we're in such a hurry
to move this stuff because why?

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:39.024
There's a one-day sale on
hospital beds. I always wanted one.

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:41.688
Oh, great. Now you're
gonna become a bed potato.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.062
- You've gotta tell this poor guy.
- Not yet.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:46.067
- Not yet what?
- We're not there yet.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.069
OK, Dave, be honest with me.

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:50.731
Has your imaginary friend
come out to play?

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.072
OK, grab a cart.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:03.084
You need a blood pressure cuff

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:06.553
and a portable ventilator,
right there, that yellow thing.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:09.955
Dave, what the hell are you doing?
This isn't a sale, man!

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.391
All right. I knew
you wouldn't come if I told you.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.329
- Do I really want to hear this?
- My imaginary friend is not imaginary.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:19.162
She is the spirit of a girl
in a coma upstairs

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.566
who they're about
to take off life support.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.468
We've got to get her someplace safe.

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:24.972
- Really?
- Really.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.907
- You should've told him.
- He wouldn't have believed me.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:31.104
- Does he believe you now?
- I had to get him into the hospital!

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:34.581
Let me take you to the psych ward.
There are people who can help!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.677
No time. It's 11:30 right now.
She's gonna be dead in half an hour!

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.483
Tell him I know this is a stretch.

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:43.753
Elizabeth is standing
right behind you right now.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.919
She knows what a stretch
this is for you.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.928
If your friend's really behind me,

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.726
ask her what I'm doing:
Rock, paper or scissors?

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.323
- Rock.
- Rock.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.601
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.462
- Paper.
- Paper.

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:59.298
- Rock again.
- Rock again.

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:02.036
- He's flipping me off.
- Are you flipping her off?

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.874
- You're flipping her off!
- How?

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:07.609
OK. OK, sometimes
people with emotional

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:10.675
and mental disturbances
can have psychic moments.

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.049
But even if she was real,

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.611
do you know what you're
risking for this woman?

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.987
- Yes!
- Why?

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.326
Because I love her.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.091
I love her.

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.825
I do, I love you.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.568
No one's ever said that to me before.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.638
- David?
- What?

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.509
- Tell him thank you.
- We're really grateful, Jack.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.877
I'm not doin' it for you.

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.313
Then why are you doing it?

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.682
Because someday, trust me,
I'm gonna need help movin' a body.

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:47.813
When that day comes,
I don't wanna hear any shit from you.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.087
OK, get me on the gurney, quick.

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.526
Oh, my God. David.

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.154
I know. She's pretty, right?

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.426
That's really sweet,
but we've gotta go.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.400
No, that's not it. This is her.

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:04.200
This is the woman I set you up with,
the woman you stood up that night!

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.330
I was gonna meet Elizabeth?

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:09.741
And she didn't make it either,
because she had an accident.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.040
It was you.

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.706
Is that it? Is that why?

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.443
I was supposed to meet you.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:17.678
How did you know her?

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.119
I'm friends with her sister.
We went out.

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:24.625
- I knew I'd seen him. That's J. J!
- Jack is J. J?

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:27.560
What did you?
No one's called me J.J. Since college.

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:29.620
He's older and hairier, but it's him.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.893
The one who tongued Abby
at the wedding?

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.959
- How the hell did you know that?
- It's Elizabeth.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:38.370
- Oh, my God. She really is here.
- I told you!

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.536
Get her on the gurney! I don't want them
killing Abby's sister! Come on.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.908
OK. Be really gentle.

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:46.804
Yeah.

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.213
I'm here already.

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.410
- That's Brett.
- He's 15 minutes early!

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:53.454
- Soon as the sister shows, we're ready.
- He's comin' in.

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:55.114
That's OK. All right.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.784
- Careful, he's smart. His name is...
- Dr. Rushton?

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:00.089
- Yeah.
- Well, hi, David Abbott.

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:02.289
Buy some time.
Tell him you're a doctor.

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.592
I'm a doctor.

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:06.190
You're a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:08.668
I'm a special consultant
from PAC Medical.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:11.297
Dr. Walsh sent me down
for a final evaluation.

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:15.002
I had no verbal or written
instructions to that end.

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.739
There's new evidence
to support that full...

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.510
Functionality can be restored.
We need to run some tests.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.016
Who's we?

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:25.076
Tell him your team is downstairs.

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:28.418
My team is downstairs with
a signed order from Dr. Walsh.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.220
- You got it.
- This is the first I've heard of this.

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.227
You won't mind
if I talk to Dr. Walsh?

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.627
Go confirm with him.
We'll wait right here.

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.460
I'll just get him on the phone.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:43.168
- David!
- OK, I'm not convincing as a doctor!

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.968
Oh, God, David,
the felonies just keep pilin' up!

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.906
- That way, David.
- Go this way.

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:50.772
- Brett!
- What happened?

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.211
Are you OK?

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.272
This is Dr. Rushton.
I need security on the third floor.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:58.342
Don’t jostle. But go faster.

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.446
- Take a right up here.
- Right here! Right, right, right!

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.224
The elevator!

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.520
Hold it! We need you to...

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:18.067
Oh, shit.

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:22.068
Stop right there!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold it!

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:24.135
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:27.275
- David.
- Elizabeth.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.817
Oh, my God, David.
My breathing tube is gone.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.853
What? No!

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.253
- Well, what can I do?
- It's too late. It's happening.

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.188
- No.
- It's strong.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.487
Be stronger.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.152
It's pulling me away.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.661
No!

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.197
Stay with me!

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:55.439
- I got ya.
- Elizabeth!

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.501
- No!
- David.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.376
- Give me a sedative!
- Help her!

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:01.848
- Gimme five of Haldol.
- Help her! Elizabeth!

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.351
- Hold him.
- No! Elizabeth!

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:15.760
What's going on?

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:17.765
- That's not possible.
- Yeah.

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:19.824
That's not possible.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:26.396
Elizabeth? Can you hear me?

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:29.638
I can't believe
we almost let you go.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:32.475
Honey? It's me, Abby.

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:35.141
- Abby.
- Yeah.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.085
I think I bumped my head.

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:47.962
It's OK.

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:00.967
Hey.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:03.641
Hello.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.512
It's me.

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:09.072
I'm sorry, I don't...

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:13.486
Honey, it's David.
You don't remember David?

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:17.657
The apartment.

01:23:18.794 --> 01:23:20.386
The rooftop.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.793
Garden.

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:24.794
Nothin'.

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:41.209
Honey, you don't
remember him at all?

01:24:46.848 --> 01:24:49.248
- Aunt Elizabeth, come on!
- Come on!

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.866
We only rented it for a month.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:19.429
- Did you move something?
- No.

01:26:22.877 --> 01:26:25.345
It's funny, I just have
this strange feeling,

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.779
like... something's missing.

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:30.010
Everything's here, just as you left it.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.384
I guess it's just been a long time.

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.881
You sure you're gonna be OK?

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:38.391
Yeah. I'm gonna be good.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.987
- So I'll see you guys Saturday.
- OK. The girls'll bake for you.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.615
Hi.

01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:16.489
Don't worry, I'm...

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:20.158
I just wanted you
to have your garden.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.533
How did you get up here?

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:31.767
Spare key.
Under the fire extinguisher.

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:40.507
Look, the last thing
I want to do is scare you.

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:43.678
Goodbye, Lizzie.

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:49.514
Wait.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.387
Yeah?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.991
The key. I need the key back.

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:03.060
Oh, right.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.643
How do I know you?

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:16.382
Maybe from your dreams.

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:25.852
If you could ever really touch me,

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:27.986
I might wake up from all of this.

01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:31.630
It wasn't a dream.

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.223
No.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.038
David.

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.583
Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.778
Righteous.
