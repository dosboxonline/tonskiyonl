WEBVTT

00:54.088 --> 00:56.918
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
Long ago, in the time
of Caesar Augustus,

00:57.057 --> 01:01.406
and in the land of Judah,
ruled by the evil King Herod,

01:01.544 --> 01:04.236
there lived a young woman
named Mary,

01:04.374 --> 01:07.067
who didn't know yet
that she was chosen by God

01:07.205 --> 01:09.310
to fulfill an ancient prophecy

01:09.448 --> 01:13.935
to bring forth a promised king
sent to save the world.

01:19.182 --> 01:20.528
Far away in the East,

01:20.666 --> 01:23.152
there were three kings
of the Order of the Magi,

01:23.290 --> 01:25.257
who knew of this prophecy.

01:27.432 --> 01:29.882
For many years,
these Magi had been searching

01:30.020 --> 01:32.747
for a certain star to appear,

01:32.885 --> 01:37.131
signaling the arrival
of this divine child.

01:37.269 --> 01:38.788
What?

01:40.548 --> 01:42.930
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
Balthazar was well known
for his ability

01:43.068 --> 01:45.174
to read and chart the stars.

01:45.312 --> 01:47.037
- Gaspar!
- Mommy?

01:47.176 --> 01:48.384
Quickly! Come!

01:48.522 --> 01:50.696
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
And this Magi, Gaspar,

01:50.834 --> 01:53.527
was easily the greatest scholar
in all the lands.

01:53.665 --> 01:55.736
The juxtaposition
of the celestial alignment

01:55.874 --> 01:57.186
between Cronus and Ares,

01:57.324 --> 01:58.601
both the deferent
and the epicycle model,

01:58.739 --> 02:01.811
show the same zodiacal
positions of the five planets!

02:03.640 --> 02:05.987
Repeat the middle part again,
if you will.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.472
The star.

02:07.610 --> 02:09.370
Just come look at the star!

02:11.786 --> 02:13.443
See for yourself.

02:15.514 --> 02:16.722
Oh.

02:22.832 --> 02:24.040
Oh, goodness.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.249
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
The moment was finally here.

02:26.387 --> 02:27.457
- Goodness!
- They had to be there

02:27.595 --> 02:29.494
- when it happened.
- This is it!

02:29.632 --> 02:32.082
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
Oh, yes,
then there was Melchior.

02:32.221 --> 02:34.326
- Melchior!
- He was the map man.

02:34.464 --> 02:36.363
A great navigator.

02:36.501 --> 02:40.436
And, well, he liked to eat--
a lot.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.338
Show us this land called Judah.

02:47.822 --> 02:49.583
Here. Precisely.

02:49.721 --> 02:51.826
Judah.

02:51.964 --> 02:52.827
That's really far.

02:52.965 --> 02:53.966
Are you certain?

02:54.104 --> 02:55.865
Those are King
Herod's lands.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.936
You, don't insult me.

02:58.074 --> 02:59.558
And, you, get me a kebab...

02:59.696 --> 03:01.836
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
It was time to pack the tent

03:01.974 --> 03:03.286
and assemble the caravan.

03:03.424 --> 03:06.013
As the Magi set out
to find this young mother,

03:06.151 --> 03:07.739
they could only wonder...

03:07.877 --> 03:11.984
What mighty queen was chosen
for this great honor?

03:12.122 --> 03:14.642
Giving birth to the Son of God.

someone I haven't even met?

05:18.973 --> 05:20.803
He just moved here
from Bethlehem.

05:20.941 --> 05:24.185
He is a good man
from a good family.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.394
His name is Joseph.

05:25.532 --> 05:29.294
I'm securing your future, Mary.

05:29.432 --> 05:32.401
But what about my dream
of becoming a teacher,

05:32.539 --> 05:33.816
like my father?

05:33.954 --> 05:35.611
You are fortunate
anyone will have you,

05:35.749 --> 05:37.682
with all your crazy ideas.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.442
Crazy ideas?

05:40.616 --> 05:42.411
You're the reason
I have these crazy ideas.

05:42.549 --> 05:44.205
You put them into my head

05:44.344 --> 05:45.517
by having me
study these Scriptures,

05:45.655 --> 05:47.864
day after day, year after year.

05:48.002 --> 05:51.627
Because I did not have a son
to teach them to.

05:51.765 --> 05:53.456
So now you punish me for it?

05:53.594 --> 05:56.390
You are a girl.

05:56.528 --> 05:59.255
You will be a wife,
not a teacher,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.809
as tradition demands.

06:06.711 --> 06:08.575
As you wish, Father.

06:23.486 --> 06:25.868
Oh, Fig.

06:26.006 --> 06:27.387
This isn't fair.

06:30.459 --> 06:33.013
Mary, can we
talk about this?

06:34.911 --> 06:37.051
I'm going to town, Deborah.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.985
Rebekah,
we're going shopping.

06:40.123 --> 06:42.091
That isn't...
That's not what I said.

06:42.229 --> 06:46.164
She needs to find fabric
for her betrothal gown.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.516
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
But I don't want
to marry for duty.

06:53.654 --> 06:56.381
I want to marry for love.

06:56.519 --> 06:58.935
Most girls look forward
to marriage.

06:59.073 --> 07:00.558
Love takes time
to grow, Mary.

07:00.696 --> 07:01.904
- Mm-hmm.
- Like a flower.

07:02.042 --> 07:04.251
Your husband
might be handsome,

07:04.389 --> 07:06.667
exciting, wonderful.

07:06.805 --> 07:08.842
He might be a very good dancer.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.291
And if he's none

Thank you.

10:51.029 --> 10:53.480
I'm an expert at choosing.

10:53.618 --> 10:54.688

10:54.826 --> 10:56.725
Oh-oh,
what I mean is th-that

10:56.863 --> 11:00.176
I-I know how... You choose... fruit?

11:01.799 --> 11:03.214
I have many skills.

11:03.352 --> 11:04.629
Mm-hmm.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.976
That's nice.

Why are you telling this
to a stranger?

11:09.910 --> 11:11.601

we're already friends, no?

11:11.740 --> 11:13.465

I'm betrothed,

11:13.603 --> 11:15.398

Yet here we are.

11:22.854 --> 11:24.407
Goodbye.

Wait, wait.
You haven't picked any fruit.

11:27.859 --> 11:29.585

you heard what I said.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.828
Choose one.

11:30.966 --> 11:32.830
It'll be my gift
to a beautiful bride.

11:32.968 --> 11:35.073
I don't accept gifts

11:35.211 --> 11:35.902
Strangers.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.697
Aren't we past that?

11:40.769 --> 11:42.080
This one's perfect.

11:42.218 --> 11:43.806
Oh.

11:43.944 --> 11:46.360
Uh, I didn't get your name.

11:48.846 --> 11:50.951
Fig?

11:51.089 --> 11:52.504
Uh, okay.

11:52.642 --> 11:54.161
Whoa.

11:54.299 --> 11:55.438
I hate donkeys.

12:11.592 --> 12:13.249
Welcome back, sire.

12:31.612 --> 12:33.166
Up, up, up, up, up.

12:33.304 --> 12:34.443
There. There.

12:34.581 --> 12:36.272
There.

12:42.037 --> 12:43.383
Father.

12:45.488 --> 12:47.870
Oh. Antipater.

12:48.008 --> 12:50.286
My firstborn.

12:51.874 --> 12:53.255
Returning from, uh...?

12:53.393 --> 12:54.256
Rome.

12:54.394 --> 12:56.983
Rome. So, um...

12:58.743 --> 13:00.849
- What do you want?
- Oh, oh.

13:00.987 --> 13:03.299
Rome has ordered us
to conduct a census.

13:03.437 --> 13:04.369
Oh.

13:04.507 --> 13:06.164
"King Herod, by decree

13:06.302 --> 13:09.098
"at the command of our lord
and emperor, Caesar Augustus,

13:09.236 --> 13:11.894
"a census shall be taken
throughout the Roman Empire.

13:12.032 --> 13:14.655
All citizens shall return
to their ancestral..."

13:14.794 --> 13:16.485
To their blah,
blah, blah, blah.

13:16.623 --> 13:18.901
Rome. You know? Rome.

13:19.039 --> 13:22.042
Rome.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.287
Father, we-we cannot
just ignore Caesar.

13:25.425 --> 13:28.808
A census would
only anger the people.

13:28.946 --> 13:30.602
We hate you, Herod!

13:30.740 --> 13:31.949
You seem to have no problem

13:32.087 --> 13:34.468
angering the people
without Caesar's help.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.643
Wine.

13:36.781 --> 13:39.025
Herod sucks!

13:39.163 --> 13:41.096
- Should I have them removed?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:41.234 --> 13:44.513
They amuse me.
Uh, they are nice people.

13:44.651 --> 13:46.411
Father.

13:46.549 --> 13:49.000
I have concerns that Rome will
hear about this unrest and...

13:49.138 --> 13:50.830
Well, I have concerns

13:50.968 --> 13:53.073
that you don't know
what it means to be a king.

13:53.211 --> 13:56.628
I...A king doesn't need to be loved.

13:56.766 --> 14:00.184
Only obeyed and feared.

14:00.322 --> 14:02.911
I live only to serve my king,
not to be one.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.164
Hello, baby.

14:15.302 --> 14:17.028
Father.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.204
Father.

14:20.342 --> 14:22.240
Don't pretend
you don't want to be king.

14:22.378 --> 14:24.587
Everyone
wants this crown.

14:24.725 --> 14:27.176
My crown!

14:32.250 --> 14:33.217
Oh.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.773
Oh, wow.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.671
That sound.

14:39.809 --> 14:41.432
Hatred?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.607
- Misery?
- No, no, no.

14:46.264 --> 14:47.887
Power.

14:56.102 --> 14:57.517
Showtime.

Welcome, Jacob. Welcome.

18:13.609 --> 18:16.819
I am so pleased that we can
share this joyous occasion.

18:16.957 --> 18:18.545
Thank you, Joachim,

18:18.683 --> 18:21.307
for your hospitality.

18:21.445 --> 18:23.102
-  Oh.
- This looks more like a wedding

18:23.240 --> 18:25.242
than a simple
betrothal ceremony.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.831
What better way for our
families to meet than a party?

18:28.969 --> 18:30.661
- Rachel.
- It's <i>Rahel.</i>

18:30.799 --> 18:33.905
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

18:34.043 --> 18:37.564
We are delighted to accept
your daughter into our family.

18:37.702 --> 18:39.359
No, the joy is ours.

18:39.497 --> 18:41.672
We don't feel as if
we are losing a daughter

18:41.810 --> 18:43.087
but gaining a son.

18:43.225 --> 18:45.848
Until now, I have been
severely outnumbered.

18:47.712 --> 18:50.094
And how is Mary feeling
about the betrothal?

18:50.232 --> 18:51.233
Mary? Oh.

18:53.028 --> 18:54.719
She couldn't be happier.

18:56.756 --> 19:00.829
Why make any plans
if everything's decided for me?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.245
Sometimes God's plans for us

19:03.383 --> 19:05.834
are even bigger than
we can imagine.

19:07.387 --> 19:09.355
You must let your faith
guide you.

19:11.564 --> 19:15.533
- I wish I had your faith.
- Oh, but you do.

19:15.671 --> 19:18.157
Do you know why your father
spent so much time with you

19:18.295 --> 19:20.193
on the Scriptures, Mary?

19:21.574 --> 19:23.990
Because he didn't have a son
to teach them to.

19:24.128 --> 19:25.336
No.

19:25.474 --> 19:27.821
Because he saw
how strong your faith was.

19:27.959 --> 19:31.204
And because he has always known
you are special.

19:32.309 --> 19:34.414
Nothing
will change that, Mary.

19:34.552 --> 19:37.210
Not even this young man.

19:37.348 --> 19:39.695
Joseph. My son.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.732
I wonder if he's cute.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.528
Oh, nice to meet you.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.599
Very nice to meet you, too.

19:46.737 --> 19:50.430
So, Joachim, shall we proceed
with the ceremony?

19:50.568 --> 19:52.363
But yes. Uh, yes, of course.

19:52.501 --> 19:55.055
Deborah, tell Mary
we are ready.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.816
The music. Play.

20:04.893 --> 20:06.929
They're ready
for you, Mary.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.034
You look beautiful.

20:08.172 --> 20:10.450
You're going to be
so happy.

20:10.588 --> 20:13.039
He is very handsome.

20:13.177 --> 20:15.490
We are almost finished.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.533

21:37.399 --> 21:39.677
In the words of Solomon:

21:39.815 --> 21:43.612
"Though one may be overpowered,
two can defend themselves.

21:43.750 --> 21:47.236
But a cord of three strands
is not easily broken."

21:47.375 --> 21:50.343
May God bind
Mary and Joseph together

21:50.481 --> 21:53.864
till the end of their days
on this earth.

21:54.002 --> 21:56.038
Or at least until
their wedding day.

21:57.902 --> 22:00.767
- Thanks be to God!
Thanks be to God.

22:06.773 --> 22:07.947
Joseph.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.848
Hi, Mary. Oh.

22:12.986 --> 22:14.091
I'm...

22:15.334 --> 22:16.335
Joseph.

22:16.473 --> 22:17.715
You?

22:19.130 --> 22:20.753
And you.

22:22.617 --> 22:24.688
They know each other?

22:24.826 --> 22:26.897
- A man of many skills.
Yeah.

22:27.035 --> 22:29.693
Uh, you're welcome.

22:32.109 --> 22:33.938
You were also betrothed?

22:34.076 --> 22:35.837
Uh...

22:35.975 --> 22:37.459
Mary?

22:40.911 --> 22:43.465
Do you need
to take a walk?

22:43.603 --> 22:45.122
Great idea, Mother.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.128
What?

22:51.266 --> 22:53.061
Uh, so what exactly
do I do now?

22:53.199 --> 22:55.960
- You go after her.
- All right. There. Okay.

22:58.687 --> 23:00.862
To life.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.898
To life!

23:03.968 --> 23:05.625
- Mary.
- Please don't chase me.

23:05.763 --> 23:08.732
I'm not. I'm not chasing you.
I just...

23:08.870 --> 23:11.493
Okay, wow, you walk fast.

23:11.631 --> 23:13.909
- For a girl?
- No. What? No.

23:14.047 --> 23:15.911
For anyone who walks.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.361
Look.

23:17.499 --> 23:19.398
Mary, we are supposed
to be talking, okay?

23:19.536 --> 23:20.813
We're supposed to be
getting to know each other.

23:20.951 --> 23:22.849
- We're betrothed.
- And you spent considerable

23:22.987 --> 23:24.989
amount of effort in
the marketplace charming a girl

23:25.127 --> 23:27.406
who informed you
that she was betrothed.

23:29.304 --> 23:30.616
You were charmed?

23:32.307 --> 23:34.343
I was cornered.

23:34.482 --> 23:36.311
Mary.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.968
Look, I'm just friendly.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.866
So friendly
that you forgot to mention

23:40.004 --> 23:41.661
that you were also betrothed,

23:41.799 --> 23:43.663
while offering
a different girl gifts.

23:43.801 --> 23:47.115
Well, actually, it-it turns out
it was the same girl, so...

23:48.565 --> 23:51.637
May I just point out, you...

23:51.775 --> 23:54.398
weren't exactly unfriendly.

23:54.536 --> 23:58.609
I was being polite
while trying to escape.

23:59.817 --> 24:01.336
If you can walk this fast,

24:01.474 --> 24:02.820
escaping should not
have been a problem.

24:02.958 --> 24:05.892
Mary, they are back there
planning our wedding right now.

24:06.030 --> 24:07.998
Yes, they are.

24:08.136 --> 24:09.275
So what do we, Mary?

24:09.413 --> 24:11.898
I don't know, Joseph.

24:14.142 --> 24:16.696
My whole life,
I wanted to be a teacher.

24:18.111 --> 24:21.874
And then one day marry someone
who I actually love.

24:24.739 --> 24:26.119
Yeah, well, you know,

24:26.257 --> 24:27.914
this wasn't
in my plans either, okay?

24:28.052 --> 24:29.571
I-I'm an inventor.

24:29.709 --> 24:32.263
I'm coming up with ideas
that could change the world,

24:32.401 --> 24:34.334
but my father said,
"You're getting married, son,"

24:34.473 --> 24:35.957
and that's the end of it.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.101
I'm sorry.

24:42.239 --> 24:44.793
Are you even hearing me
right now? Mary.

24:47.934 --> 24:50.834
You're not the only one

Of course.

29:23.313 --> 29:25.073
Mary.

29:26.592 --> 29:27.524
Mary.

29:27.662 --> 29:30.561
Just choose a fruit.

29:31.666 --> 29:33.116
Man of many skills.

29:36.636 --> 29:38.915
Mary!

29:40.399 --> 29:41.952
Do not be afraid.: Deborah.

29:42.090 --> 29:43.471
- I'm sorry I frightened you.
- Rebekah.

29:43.609 --> 29:46.094
- Wake up. Wake up.
- They won't wake up.

29:46.232 --> 29:47.820
Am I... am I dreaming?

29:47.958 --> 29:49.408
You are not dreaming.

29:49.546 --> 29:52.860
No one is talking to me right
now because I am dreaming.

29:52.998 --> 29:55.207
- Wake up now.
- Again, not dreaming.

29:58.037 --> 29:59.245
Am I, am I dead?

29:59.383 --> 30:00.522
You're not dead.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.938
Though you sleep like you are.

30:03.594 --> 30:08.220
I'm Gabriel,
and I bring you good news.

30:09.324 --> 30:12.224
God has chosen you
to have a son.

30:12.362 --> 30:14.467
Th-That can't be. I don't,
I don't have a husband yet.

30:14.605 --> 30:18.126
And this child will be
the Son of the Almighty God.

30:19.231 --> 30:21.612
And you will name him Jesus.

30:21.750 --> 30:24.753
And he will be called
the King of All Kings.

30:24.892 --> 30:26.928
Impossible.

30:27.066 --> 30:30.518
Nothing is impossible
when it is God's will.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.520
Your cousin Elizabeth,

30:32.658 --> 30:36.904
even in her old age,
is with child this very moment.

30:38.595 --> 30:39.803
"Jesus"?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.885
That's... that's the...

30:53.023 --> 30:54.542
The promised king.

30:57.821 --> 31:00.203
I am not
in the least bit worthy.

31:00.341 --> 31:06.105
You are more blessed
than any other woman, Mary.

31:06.243 --> 31:09.212
Who would...
who would believe me?

31:09.350 --> 31:12.456
They'll think I'm crazy.
Or worse.

31:12.594 --> 31:14.044
And-and-and Joseph.

31:14.182 --> 31:15.666
I mean, what betrothed man
would want to hear

31:15.804 --> 31:18.669
that his wife-to-be
is already pr... pregnant.

31:18.807 --> 31:21.017
Rise, Mary.

31:28.058 --> 31:32.752
You are to be the mother
to a savior and king.

31:35.790 --> 31:38.137
You cower before no one.

31:40.415 --> 31:41.485
Wait, wait-wait-wait-wait.

31:41.623 --> 31:43.936
I have, I have
so many questions.

32:07.132 --> 32:09.168
Get out!

32:50.347 --> 32:51.555
JOACHIM [VOICE-OVER]:
This is madness.

32:51.693 --> 32:54.248
Our minds play tricks on us
at night.

32:54.386 --> 32:56.319
This wasn't a dream.
The angel was there.

32:56.457 --> 32:59.011
- It was Gabriel.
- Madness.

32:59.149 --> 33:01.151
The Son of God?

33:01.289 --> 33:03.464
Those words alone
are dangerous.

33:03.602 --> 33:05.569
People are stoned
for that kind of blasphemy.

33:05.707 --> 33:08.987
Father, those are the words
the angel spoke to me.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.196
No more talk of angels.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.682
What if it's true?

33:14.820 --> 33:16.477
How can it be?

33:23.415 --> 33:25.520
Have I ever lied to any of you?

33:34.391 --> 33:38.464
I must pray to merciful God
for guidance.

33:38.602 --> 33:41.467
No one speaks of this
to anyone.

33:41.605 --> 33:43.883
To anyone!

33:44.022 --> 33:46.196
This wasn't a dream.
- What?

33:48.681 --> 33:50.235
What are you saying?

33:50.373 --> 33:51.857
I'm telling you the truth.

33:51.995 --> 33:53.272
An angel came to me.

33:53.410 --> 33:55.067
He said I would give birth
to the Son of God.

33:55.205 --> 33:57.069
Do you even hear yourself?

33:58.933 --> 34:01.349
Is marrying me so bad

34:01.487 --> 34:03.903
that you had to make up a story
like this to get out of it?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.629
I know
it sounds impossible.

34:05.767 --> 34:07.907
It doesn't sound
impossible, Mary.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.530
It is impossible.

34:10.910 --> 34:14.155
What did you expect me to say,
"congratulations"?

34:14.293 --> 34:16.537
You can say you believe me.

34:18.435 --> 34:20.196
Joseph cannot help you.

34:21.749 --> 34:23.647
Mary, tell them
this is just a joke.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.207
I'm with child.

34:33.588 --> 34:35.763
It's not like what you think,
I promise.

34:35.901 --> 34:39.629
He won't be sullied by this.
He's a good young man.

34:39.767 --> 34:42.045
P-Please, if I can just explain
more of what the angel said.

34:42.183 --> 34:43.426
Oh, yes, the angel.

34:43.564 --> 34:46.187
We won't listen
to more of this blasphemy.

34:46.325 --> 34:47.878
I won't have it.

34:49.294 --> 34:51.434
Let's just,
let's just take a walk.

34:51.572 --> 34:53.850
Leave him alone.

34:55.196 --> 34:56.232
Enough.

34:56.370 --> 34:58.406
- You must leave.
- Joseph, please.

34:59.338 --> 35:00.788
Get out.

35:00.926 --> 35:04.412
Please don't come here again.

35:13.628 --> 35:15.492
- Joseph.
Get out.

35:46.247 --> 35:48.111
But I can care for Mary here.

35:48.249 --> 35:49.561
No, Mary's right.

35:49.699 --> 35:51.114
It is better
for all of us

35:51.252 --> 35:53.496
if she goes to stay
with Elizabeth.

35:53.634 --> 35:55.739
She will leave for Hebron
in the morning.

Are we close
to Judah yet?

39:49.352 --> 39:51.768
We have been out here forever.

39:54.944 --> 39:56.014
This is Judah.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.017
What?

39:59.155 --> 40:00.639
Why wouldn't you tell us?

40:00.777 --> 40:02.020
We've been here for days.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.506
We must meet the king
of this land.

40:05.644 --> 40:07.819
He will have the scrolls
we need to find the child.

40:07.957 --> 40:09.821
Obviously.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.029
Then let's go.

40:11.167 --> 40:13.859
Hey. Listen.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.655
It's date palm season.
It happens once a year.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.243
Melchior, we must go.

40:18.381 --> 40:20.659
But I'm saying that I know
a place nearby where they've got

40:20.797 --> 40:21.867
the fat, juicy ones.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.662
- Fresh. Smell great.
- Goodness. Shame!

40:23.800 --> 40:25.112
- They're fresh.
- Shame!

40:25.250 --> 40:27.045
- What's the matter with you?
- You are a Magi.

40:27.183 --> 40:29.668
You would miss
the birth of the Son of God?

40:29.806 --> 40:32.360
Jerusalem.
I'm talking about Jerusalem.

40:32.499 --> 40:33.500
What is in Jerusalem?

40:33.638 --> 40:35.950
King Herod! Your scrolls!

40:36.088 --> 40:37.365
My dates!

40:37.504 --> 40:40.610
Now stop yelling at me!

40:40.748 --> 40:42.267
No one is yelling at you.

40:42.405 --> 40:44.580
You were yelling a little bit.

40:44.718 --> 40:46.374
- Yeah. You were.
- I was not yelling.

40:46.513 --> 40:47.652
Come on. Help me up.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.967
No more dates for you.

40:53.105 --> 40:53.899
Thank you.

40:54.037 --> 40:56.315
Geez.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.386
Ah.

40:58.525 --> 40:59.698
I hate camels.

40:59.836 --> 41:01.769
Not you.
But as a mode of transport.

41:01.907 --> 41:03.771
Look at you.
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

41:03.909 --> 41:05.532
Look at you
with your dead eyes.

41:05.670 --> 41:07.982
- He's talking to camels now.
- You know, someday

41:08.120 --> 41:10.985
there has to be a better mode
of transport other than you.

41:11.123 --> 41:12.849
Is there no other king
available?

41:12.987 --> 41:13.850
There has to be.

41:13.988 --> 41:15.749
Could've just been
two wise men.

41:17.371 --> 41:18.441
Let's go!

41:18.579 --> 41:21.133
You're yelling again.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.699
Zachariah still
hasn't said a word.

41:34.837 --> 41:36.804
From the moment
he learned of my pregnancy,

41:36.942 --> 41:38.185
he hasn't been able to speak.

41:38.323 --> 41:39.393
Oh.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.705
I was shocked at first.

41:40.843 --> 41:42.120
But now I think

41:42.258 --> 41:45.295
I may have been given
yet another gift.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.574
Apparently his ears still work.

41:50.784 --> 41:54.891
Elizabeth, who am I
to raise this baby?

41:56.721 --> 41:59.240
Maybe my father is right.
This is madness.

41:59.378 --> 42:01.208
You were chosen for reasons

42:01.346 --> 42:03.693
that, one day, even your
father will understand.

42:03.831 --> 42:06.662
When will I understand?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.457
If my husband could talk,
he would say,

42:09.596 --> 42:12.737
"Patience is
a good companion for faith."

42:17.604 --> 42:19.157
Mary.

42:19.295 --> 42:21.573
Why didn't Joseph bring you?

42:21.711 --> 42:23.575
This is more than
he can accept.

42:24.887 --> 42:26.578
I don't believe
you're meant to be alone.

42:26.716 --> 42:28.407
Then why did God have me
promised to a man

42:28.546 --> 42:30.755
that doesn't want to
believe me?

42:30.893 --> 42:32.998
Why does part of me
want to believe her?

42:33.136 --> 42:35.276
It's like I'm being
torn in two.

42:35.414 --> 42:36.899
Joseph, it is over.

42:38.659 --> 42:40.385
I feel like
I've done something wrong.

42:40.523 --> 42:42.076
This is her doing,
not yours.

42:44.458 --> 42:46.978
Joachim and I have agreed
there will be no wedding.

42:47.116 --> 42:48.013
What?

42:48.151 --> 42:49.532
There can't be
any other way.

42:49.670 --> 42:51.396
Tell Joachim
I will end the engagement.

42:51.534 --> 42:53.053
Quietly.

42:54.986 --> 42:58.334
Your mother and I
will return home to Bethlehem.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.582
I just don't know what to do.

43:08.862 --> 43:11.830
You need to forget
about her, Joseph.

43:38.512 --> 43:41.411
You are a liar.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.727
This is blasphemy.

43:49.488 --> 43:51.629
You should be stoned for this.

43:51.767 --> 43:53.216
Enough.

43:53.354 --> 43:54.942

Mary needs you.

46:45.043 --> 46:47.218
Go to her now.

46:57.435 --> 46:58.988
No.

47:05.650 --> 47:08.032
No!

47:11.690 --> 47:14.141
Get out!

47:19.319 --> 47:21.286
Is everything all right, sire?

47:24.496 --> 47:26.050
Get out.

47:27.361 --> 47:28.915
Get out!

47:40.996 --> 47:42.963
Shay...

47:46.829 --> 47:48.900
Do I look, uh,

47:49.038 --> 47:51.385
pale to you?

47:51.523 --> 47:52.800
Yes.

47:52.939 --> 47:56.804
I mean, I think His Highness

47:56.943 --> 47:58.530
could use some sleep.

47:58.668 --> 48:00.601
Wow.

48:00.739 --> 48:02.362
Brilliant.

48:03.432 --> 48:05.020
You are useless.

48:05.158 --> 48:07.229
- Father.
- What?

48:08.851 --> 48:10.128
About that.

48:11.681 --> 48:12.993
There are some Magi here

48:13.131 --> 48:15.720
who claim they're experts
in reading the stars.

48:15.858 --> 48:17.998
What-what-what are Magi?

48:18.136 --> 48:19.689
I don't know
what you're talking about.

48:19.827 --> 48:21.243
Wise men from the East.

48:23.970 --> 48:25.178
They are kings.

48:26.489 --> 48:27.801
Kings.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.527
They may be
of some use to you.

48:35.809 --> 48:39.330
They look like circus people.

48:39.468 --> 48:41.332
Eh.

48:42.229 --> 48:45.025
This should be interesting.

48:47.269 --> 48:49.927
King Herod, it is very nice
to meet you, Your Majesty...

48:50.065 --> 48:53.861
Why are you in my lands?

48:54.000 --> 48:57.348
We have come from far away
to worship a divine king

48:57.486 --> 48:59.626
that is to be born
in your lands.

48:59.764 --> 49:02.767
A star appeared to us,
one we've been searching for

49:02.905 --> 49:04.355
our entire lives.

49:04.493 --> 49:06.081
- A star.
- Yes.

49:06.219 --> 49:07.772
It led us here, sire.

49:07.910 --> 49:09.429
We believe
the time is nigh.

49:09.567 --> 49:10.568
Which means soon.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.159
It may also
explain your...

49:15.297 --> 49:17.161
recent dreams, sire.

49:18.541 --> 49:20.647
You told them about
my nightmares?

49:25.790 --> 49:30.070
I've not heard of any queen
visiting this kingdom.

49:30.208 --> 49:31.347
Who is the mother?

49:31.485 --> 49:33.315
Now we believe
that he is to be born

49:33.453 --> 49:37.664
not of a queen,
but of a humble virgin.

49:37.802 --> 49:42.117
Where might we find this,
uh, humble mother?

49:42.255 --> 49:44.188
We've been trying to unravel
that very mystery,

49:44.326 --> 49:45.499
Your Magnificence.

49:45.637 --> 49:47.674
But we are missing
certain ancient scrolls.

49:47.812 --> 49:51.160
We need your help, sire,
to find the child.

49:52.368 --> 49:55.371
And why would I help you

49:55.509 --> 49:59.617
to find a new king
in my kingdom?

50:03.897 --> 50:05.761
Eh. He's got a point, right?

50:12.043 --> 50:14.735
Well, when you
put it that way.

50:16.185 --> 50:18.153
Because I...

50:18.291 --> 50:20.189
have the very thing
to get you back

50:20.327 --> 50:22.329
sitting on your...

50:22.467 --> 50:25.436
nightmare-inducing throne.

50:25.574 --> 50:27.990
What are you blathering about?

50:28.128 --> 50:30.406
I'm talking about...

50:30.544 --> 50:31.718
myrrh.

50:32.960 --> 50:33.823
Myrrh?

50:33.961 --> 50:36.033
- Myrrh.
- Myrrh.

50:36.171 --> 50:38.345
Myrrh.: Myrrh.

50:38.483 --> 50:40.278
It-it-it sounds like
a little lamb.

50:40.416 --> 50:41.728
Myrrh.

50:41.866 --> 50:43.040
Not now, Melchior.

50:43.178 --> 50:44.213
Will Your Lordship

50:44.351 --> 50:45.559
allow me to give you a gift?

50:46.974 --> 50:48.286

I beg of you.

Perhaps we should go.

54:03.964 --> 54:05.725
- My thoughts exactly.
- Where is the exit?

54:05.863 --> 54:06.795
Is it this way?

54:08.383 --> 54:10.626
Okay, enough.
Balthazar. Come on. Come on!

54:15.838 --> 54:19.325
Rome cannot hear about
this other king.

54:20.222 --> 54:22.017
I want the mother found.

54:24.537 --> 54:26.608
I'll send spies
to every village.

54:26.746 --> 54:28.057
Yeah.

54:28.195 --> 54:31.302
It should not be difficult
to locate an unwed peasant girl

54:31.440 --> 54:33.131
claiming to carry the child

54:33.270 --> 54:35.168
of a Hebrew God.

54:35.306 --> 54:38.413
Yeah, it shouldn't be,
so find her!

54:40.069 --> 54:41.968
I'm gonna take a nap.

55:12.585 --> 55:14.103
What beautiful flowers.

55:14.241 --> 55:16.658
Seems you have the magic touch.

55:16.796 --> 55:18.625
-  It's me.
- What are you doing here?

55:18.763 --> 55:20.627
Those men are looking for you.

55:20.765 --> 55:21.870
What are you talking about?

55:22.008 --> 55:24.459
I had a dream,
I had a nightmare,

55:24.597 --> 55:27.634
and those soldiers
were in my dream.

55:29.878 --> 55:31.500
One does not often

55:31.638 --> 55:35.124
see a woman of your... years

55:35.262 --> 55:36.816
ready to give birth.

55:36.954 --> 55:38.058
Yes.

55:38.196 --> 55:39.991
What was God thinking?

55:41.407 --> 55:42.684
Is this your husband?

55:42.822 --> 55:44.927
Yes, but I'm afraid
my husband is mute.

55:45.065 --> 55:46.653
Look at me.

55:47.585 --> 55:49.311
This isn't safe.

55:49.449 --> 55:50.657
It is not every day

55:50.795 --> 55:52.728
that a prince of Judea
visits us, sire.

55:52.866 --> 55:54.627
To what do we owe this honor?

55:54.765 --> 55:57.146
I've heard from reliable
sources in Hebron

55:57.284 --> 55:59.597
that a certain young woman
with child

55:59.735 --> 56:01.565
might be living on this farm.

56:01.703 --> 56:03.394
We've been searching
for her for weeks.

56:06.708 --> 56:08.572
As you can see, sire,

56:08.710 --> 56:10.194
whoever told you that
must be blind.

56:10.332 --> 56:14.371
No, the woman I seek
is unmarried and much younger.

56:15.475 --> 56:17.132
She's in no danger.

56:25.140 --> 56:26.969
You don't mind
if we have a look around?

56:28.074 --> 56:29.386
Of course.

56:30.421 --> 56:32.423
You're our guest.

56:35.737 --> 56:37.463
You live quite modestly.

56:38.878 --> 56:40.949
God has blessed us,
for which we are grateful.

56:41.087 --> 56:42.744
Just trust me.

56:44.849 --> 56:46.541
There's no need to be nervous.

56:52.478 --> 56:53.996
Is there?

57:18.780 --> 57:21.921
If you do see
this young woman...

57:24.095 --> 57:26.373
...you will report it.

57:26.512 --> 57:30.067
Then my father, King Herod,
will bless you.

57:39.594 --> 57:42.217
Your generosity is appreciated.

58:02.064 --> 58:03.963
Mary.

58:07.173 --> 58:08.761
You're welcome.

58:12.627 --> 58:14.974
Joseph, my betrothed.

58:19.288 --> 58:21.256
So you're here
because of a dream?

58:21.394 --> 58:22.360
Yes.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.742
No. Uh...

58:24.880 --> 58:29.160
Mary, I'm here because
I'm supposed to be with you.

58:29.298 --> 58:31.059
I should have never let you go.

58:33.855 --> 58:35.373
You owe me nothing.

58:38.100 --> 58:39.205
Please, Mary.

58:39.343 --> 58:41.414
Come back to Nazareth with me.
You heard him.

58:41.552 --> 58:43.968
He said he was looking for
a young, unwed pregnant woman.

58:44.106 --> 58:45.901
Listen to Joseph, Mary.

58:47.144 --> 58:48.421
He was a royal.

58:48.559 --> 58:49.940
A son of King Herod.

58:50.078 --> 58:52.321
Those exact soldiers
were in my dream.

58:52.459 --> 58:54.082
That's no coincidence.

58:54.220 --> 58:56.256
You are in danger, Mary.

59:01.192 --> 59:03.125
Herod must know
of the prophecy.

59:06.266 --> 59:07.578
He wants my child.

59:15.966 --> 59:17.346
We're getting married.

59:19.141 --> 59:20.522
Great. Great, yes.

59:20.660 --> 59:22.455
Um, yes. I...

59:22.593 --> 59:24.319
We will go to Nazareth
in the morning

59:24.457 --> 59:26.424
to make arrangements,
and I...

59:26.563 --> 59:27.978
I will claim this child
as my own.

59:28.116 --> 59:30.497
No, we're getting married
right here.

59:30.636 --> 59:31.740
Today.

59:33.362 --> 59:34.640
Uh, well...

59:35.675 --> 59:37.504
What about our fathers?

59:37.643 --> 59:39.437
They called off the wedding.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.749
What about our mothers?

59:40.887 --> 59:42.164
They would...
they would want to be here.

59:42.302 --> 59:43.303
We can't wait, Joseph.

59:43.441 --> 59:45.582
When I'm married,
my child is safe.

59:49.689 --> 59:51.691
Will you marry me, Joseph?

59:54.521 --> 59:56.351
I do.

59:56.489 --> 59:57.421
I will. Yes.

59:57.559 --> 59:59.872
Of course. Yes. Um...

01:00:00.942 --> 01:00:02.668
Who's gonna marry us?

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:05.912
A priest.

01:00:14.714 --> 01:00:15.853

Are you no closer to learning
where this king will be born?

01:03:01.881 --> 01:03:03.365
We are patient men.

01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:05.643
My father is not.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.439
You seem... tense.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:09.613
Have some wine.

01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:11.442
I do not need wine.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.823
I need answers.

01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:15.619
I don't understand
your obsession

01:03:15.757 --> 01:03:18.277
with this peasant and her baby.

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:20.141
You are rich kings.

01:03:20.279 --> 01:03:23.385
What we seek cannot be
purchased with riches.

01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:24.766
Then what do you seek?

01:03:24.904 --> 01:03:26.285
- Wisdom.
- Truth.

01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:28.597
And the very meaning
of life.

01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:32.118
What meaning is there

01:03:32.256 --> 01:03:35.121
in groveling to a peasant baby?

01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:39.160
You are meant to be worshipped,
not to worship others.

01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:43.095
The meaning of life comes not
from what others do for us,

01:03:43.233 --> 01:03:45.062
but what we do for others.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.135
King or peasant, we will
all one day bend the knee.

01:03:49.273 --> 01:03:52.311
What could this child
possibly offer

01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.934
that my father
does not already have?

01:03:55.072 --> 01:03:56.971
Well, how about...

01:03:57.109 --> 01:04:00.457
I don't know,
a good night's sleep?

01:04:06.394 --> 01:04:09.776
My father wants
the mother found!

01:04:09.915 --> 01:04:12.262
We'll do our best.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.271
That was my favorite vintage.

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:27.208
Are you certain the child
will be born in Bethlehem?

01:04:27.346 --> 01:04:29.348
Oh, goodness,
I'm quite certain.

01:04:29.486 --> 01:04:33.559
Well, clearly, we must find
the mother before they do.

01:05:02.036 --> 01:05:03.451
The Magi are gone.

01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:05.280
They must have left
in the night.

01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:07.075
What do you mean they're gone?

01:05:07.213 --> 01:05:09.871
I have reports of them
heading toward Bethlehem.

01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:12.046
That must be
where the mother is.

01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:15.083
I will go after them.

01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:17.396
I-I thought
you scoured Bethlehem.

01:05:17.534 --> 01:05:19.156
No one matching
her description was there.

01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:20.571
Well...

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:22.297
then...

01:05:22.435 --> 01:05:24.679
take your men back to Bethlehem

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:26.474
and-and kill
every pregnant woman

01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:28.717
and baby you find.

01:05:28.855 --> 01:05:30.547
Problem solved.

01:05:30.685 --> 01:05:32.273
Father.

01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:34.689
No.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.347
I...

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:39.694
We cannot do that.

01:05:45.596 --> 01:05:47.253
Why not?

01:05:50.118 --> 01:05:52.258
What if...

01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:55.123
all of Judea
revolts against you?

01:05:55.261 --> 01:05:58.782
Rome may question your sanity.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.266
My sanity.

01:06:00.404 --> 01:06:02.130
My sanity is why I need

01:06:02.268 --> 01:06:05.099
to rid myself
of these nightmares.

01:06:06.824 --> 01:06:09.275
There is another way, Father.

01:06:09.413 --> 01:06:11.174
Well?

01:06:11.312 --> 01:06:14.556
Then tell me, my son.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.735
What would you do
if you were king?

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:30.089
Use Rome to your advantage.

01:06:30.227 --> 01:06:33.644
If Caesar wants a census,
give it to him.

01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:39.064
Continue!

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:44.138
A census allows for your
soldiers to search every home

01:06:44.276 --> 01:06:48.142
and count every head,
all in the name of Caesar.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.798
The woman will be found.

01:06:49.936 --> 01:06:53.423
And Rome will be appeased.

01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:07.402
Order the census.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.302
But if you don't find her,
kill them all.

01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:16.480
Show me you can be a true king.

01:07:22.762 --> 01:07:26.387
You are no different
than me, boy.

01:07:26.525 --> 01:07:30.977

MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
You know, you made
a really big mistake.

01:10:49.348 --> 01:10:51.661
I have? What?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.767
Well, now that I know
you can cook...

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:58.254
...I'll expect it every day.

01:10:58.392 --> 01:11:00.532
Well...

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:03.017
that's only if you want
the same stew every day.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:05.744
It's a start.

01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:09.782
I think even Fig is beginning
to tolerate you.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.336
Wow.

01:11:12.716 --> 01:11:14.856
Must be really good stew.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.066
Open up!

01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:26.040
Whoa. E-Excuse me. Who are you?

01:11:26.178 --> 01:11:29.146
I'm here by order of Caesar
for the census.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.839
Name.

01:11:33.047 --> 01:11:35.256
I am Joseph, son of Jacob.

01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:36.499
Place of birth.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.399
Nazareth?

01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:43.333
I'm from Bethlehem.

01:11:45.024 --> 01:11:47.441
Then by order of Caesar,
you and your family

01:11:47.579 --> 01:11:49.305
must travel to Bethlehem
and be counted.

01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:50.685
Immediately.

01:11:50.823 --> 01:11:52.860
Sir, my wife is with child.

01:11:52.998 --> 01:11:56.346
As you can see, she is in no
condition to travel that far.

01:11:56.484 --> 01:11:58.175
There are no exceptions.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.523
She is a Nazarene. Surely,
she can stay with her mother

01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:01.765
this close to giving birth.

01:12:01.903 --> 01:12:03.526
Your wife goes with you
to Bethlehem

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:06.632
or she will give birth
in a dungeon.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.601
No.

01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:13.398
No. Please.

01:12:14.882 --> 01:12:18.126
Of course, we will leave
first thing in the morning.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.063
We will be back
to make sure of it.

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.386
All right, move on.

01:12:36.524 --> 01:12:38.388
To the next one.

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:41.115
Bethlehem is more
than a week's journey.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.155
I don't know
if you can do this.

01:12:47.293 --> 01:12:48.709
I'll be okay.

01:12:49.951 --> 01:12:52.437
You heard him, Joseph.
We have to go.

01:12:59.133 --> 01:13:00.859
I will make preparations.

01:15:00.185 --> 01:15:02.428
That's the way
into Bethlehem.

01:15:02.567 --> 01:15:03.913
Stay here.

01:15:04.051 --> 01:15:05.811
Step up. You, step up.

01:15:21.413 --> 01:15:22.828
Hurry up.

01:15:36.048 --> 01:15:38.257
- What is it? What did you see?
- He's here.

01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:39.914
Herod's son.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:45.471
This isn't safe, Joseph.

01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:47.163
It's probably just the census.

01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:48.751
We're married now.

01:15:48.889 --> 01:15:50.166
I think it'll be okay.

01:15:50.304 --> 01:15:53.100
No. It's me they're
looking for, I know it.

01:15:56.828 --> 01:15:58.726
What is it?

01:15:58.864 --> 01:16:00.901
- What?
- We have to hurry.

01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:06.458
I can't have
the baby here, Joseph.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:08.322
Bethlehem isn't safe.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.324
Joseph... We can't go back.

01:16:10.462 --> 01:16:11.428
Mary, I'm sorry.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.672
I promised to protect you,

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:15.432
and I failed you
in every possible way.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.813
Joseph!

01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:19.747
I'm not the only one
who was chosen for this.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.927
I know another way in.

01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:29.032
I'll get you to my mother.

01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:31.207
She will help us.
Fig.

01:16:32.484 --> 01:16:33.796
Come on.

01:16:58.544 --> 01:17:00.512
Our wait is over.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.997
Tonight is the night, gentlemen.

01:17:03.135 --> 01:17:06.173
Yes. Finally.

01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:07.830
Oh, goodness.

01:17:07.968 --> 01:17:10.004
No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:10.142 --> 01:17:12.213
My clothes
smell of sheep dung.

01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:14.284
My skin
smells of sheep dung.

01:17:14.422 --> 01:17:16.735
This whole earth
is made of sheep dung.

01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:20.394
And tonight,
I meet the Son of God.

01:17:22.016 --> 01:17:23.880
This is just perfect.

01:17:26.745 --> 01:17:28.713
We must ready ourselves.

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:36.168
Oh, hello.

01:17:36.306 --> 01:17:37.963
Son of God,
let me introduce myself.

01:17:38.101 --> 01:17:40.759
I am the King of Sheep Dung.

01:17:40.897 --> 01:17:43.866
Yes, I have a few
hygiene issues right now.

01:17:44.004 --> 01:17:45.661
Nice to meet you.

01:17:58.018 --> 01:18:00.883
That tunnel's the only way in.

01:18:06.923 --> 01:18:10.030
- What are you doing?
- I'm creating a distraction.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.490
What are you doing?

01:18:22.628 --> 01:18:24.596
Creating a distraction.

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.874
Mary. Mary.

01:18:27.012 --> 01:18:29.014
That's...

01:18:29.152 --> 01:18:31.016
Uh...

01:18:33.778 --> 01:18:34.882
Oh.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:38.196
Now's our chance. Let's go.

01:18:43.822 --> 01:18:46.066
Wait, wait. What about Fig?
He won't fit.

01:18:46.204 --> 01:18:47.619
Don't worry. He'll find me.

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:49.241
He always does.

01:19:33.492 --> 01:19:34.908
Let me make sure it's safe.

01:19:47.058 --> 01:19:48.542
We can't go to my parents.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.475
- What?
- There's more soldiers.

01:19:50.613 --> 01:19:52.718
Joseph, we have to hurry.

01:19:52.857 --> 01:19:55.445
- Okay. Stay here.
- Joseph, wait.

01:19:55.583 --> 01:19:57.482
Jo... Joseph.

01:20:11.392 --> 01:20:12.946
I'm asking you
if you could find it

01:20:13.084 --> 01:20:14.464
in the kindness in your heart
to please just provide...

01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:15.914
No. Sorry, I cannot....a safe place for us

01:20:16.052 --> 01:20:17.364
to stay tonight.
We'd be out...

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.445
Hey, you!

01:20:31.343 --> 01:20:32.828
Wait.

01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:33.863
You! Stop!

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:35.554
No, no, no. Sorry.

01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:37.211
We have no room.

01:20:39.765 --> 01:20:40.836
Hey!

01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:53.745
Thank you, Fig.

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:54.815
What happened?

01:20:54.953 --> 01:20:56.541
Fig found me.

01:20:56.679 --> 01:20:57.853
Good boy.

01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.269
Let's go.

Joseph.

What do you want?

01:26:02.536 --> 01:26:04.538
We have no quarrel
with you, sire.

01:26:06.437 --> 01:26:08.577
I want to talk.

01:26:11.235 --> 01:26:13.789
You leave her alone.

01:26:15.756 --> 01:26:16.861
Who is the father?

01:26:18.759 --> 01:26:20.451
I am.

01:26:22.453 --> 01:26:23.937
No, you're not.

01:26:26.422 --> 01:26:28.459
It seems you found your king.

01:26:28.597 --> 01:26:30.288
The child is no threat
to your father.

01:26:30.426 --> 01:26:33.567
My father would heartily disagree.

01:26:33.705 --> 01:26:38.296
GABRIEL [VOICE-OVER, ECHOING]:
You cower before no one.

01:26:43.474 --> 01:26:47.202
So you are the one
who's caused so much trouble.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.207
And this child is
the new king of Judea?

01:26:53.449 --> 01:26:55.279
He hasn't come
for your father's throne.

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:58.213
What kind of king
does not want a throne

01:26:58.351 --> 01:27:01.250
and is born in a place
like this?

01:27:01.388 --> 01:27:03.701
One who has come
to save the lost.

01:27:05.634 --> 01:27:07.256
Am I lost?

01:27:10.328 --> 01:27:12.606
"Like sheep we have
all gone astray.

01:27:12.744 --> 01:27:13.987
And God has put on him..."

01:27:14.125 --> 01:27:16.472
"...the punishment for all
the evil we have done."

01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:19.717
Yes, I know
your Scriptures as well.

01:27:23.479 --> 01:27:28.035
So, you truly believe
that this child...

01:27:30.521 --> 01:27:32.108
...born in this filth...

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:34.318
is the chosen one?

01:27:35.215 --> 01:27:36.561
A king.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.519
I believe you know
exactly who he is.

01:28:08.144 --> 01:28:10.802
I envy your faith.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.668
Faith is trusting what you know
in your heart to be true.

01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:19.121
Well done, sire.

01:28:19.259 --> 01:28:20.916
You found them.

01:28:21.054 --> 01:28:22.814
Yes, I did.

01:28:23.781 --> 01:28:26.370
Do we seize them
or end them now?

01:28:27.888 --> 01:28:29.442
You have your faith,

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.099
but I have my orders.

01:28:32.237 --> 01:28:34.309
You have a choice.

01:28:35.517 --> 01:28:36.966
You are not your father.

01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:52.465
Sire?

01:28:52.603 --> 01:28:53.604
Please.

01:28:53.742 --> 01:28:55.433
Men.
- Please.

01:28:57.228 --> 01:28:58.471
Sire?

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:04.925
You will give them
safe passage.

01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:07.721
What?

01:29:08.895 --> 01:29:10.862
They are now
under my protection.

01:29:12.208 --> 01:29:13.348
The king's orders
were clear.

01:29:13.486 --> 01:29:16.143
These people are no threat
to a true king.

01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:17.386
Sire.

01:29:20.941 --> 01:29:22.046
You heard me.

01:29:24.842 --> 01:29:26.568
Leave us.

01:29:26.706 --> 01:29:27.776
Yes.

01:29:28.846 --> 01:29:30.468
Of course.

01:29:38.442 --> 01:29:40.271
You must leave Judea at once.

01:29:40.409 --> 01:29:44.931
When my father hears of this,
I cannot protect you.

01:29:48.486 --> 01:29:49.798
Thank you.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:29:59.842
What is his name?

01:30:03.432 --> 01:30:04.882
Jesus.

01:30:17.273 --> 01:30:19.344
I always knew I liked him.

01:30:19.483 --> 01:30:20.794
He came.

01:30:20.932 --> 01:30:23.245
He saw. He went.

01:30:23.383 --> 01:30:25.316
- And so should we.
You heard the man.

01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:27.042
Gather your things.

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.561
Did you hear him say "Judea"?

01:30:28.699 --> 01:30:30.114
What's this Judea business?
It's Judah.

01:30:30.252 --> 01:30:32.599
I had another dream.
We have to get to Egypt.

01:30:34.739 --> 01:30:37.259
Ugar is over there.

01:30:37.397 --> 01:30:39.088
You come down to Nagur.

01:30:40.365 --> 01:30:42.195
Ha, ha, ha.

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:43.541
From Ugar you go
to Beinangnin...

01:30:43.679 --> 01:30:45.129
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
So the family

01:30:45.267 --> 01:30:46.613
prepared to travel to Egypt,

01:30:46.751 --> 01:30:48.132
knowing they would not
be safe at home

01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:49.892
as long as Herod was alive.

01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:51.376
Oh, Judah's there.

01:30:51.515 --> 01:30:52.654
- Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

01:30:52.792 --> 01:30:54.034
So you are in... Why don't I just take...

01:30:54.172 --> 01:30:55.104
Why don't... Yeah.

01:30:57.521 --> 01:31:01.248
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
But first, the Magi
had gifts to present.

01:31:01.386 --> 01:31:03.872
Gifts that would be very useful
for the journey ahead.

01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:06.599
Please accept this gold
for food and shelter.

01:31:06.737 --> 01:31:08.773
You are too generous, sir.

01:31:10.568 --> 01:31:12.397
This resin of frankincense

01:31:12.536 --> 01:31:15.021
will soothe the baby
during your travels.

01:31:16.091 --> 01:31:17.644
It smells wonderful.

01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:22.753
And this is myrrh.

01:31:22.891 --> 01:31:24.824
It does everything else.

01:31:28.828 --> 01:31:30.795
Wh...

01:31:38.354 --> 01:31:41.323
But, really,
what does myrrh actually do?

01:31:41.461 --> 01:31:44.706
It does everything.
You-you cannot quantify

01:31:44.844 --> 01:31:46.915
what one amount of myrrh does.

01:31:47.053 --> 01:31:48.295
Goodness, please stop
with the myrrh.

01:31:48.433 --> 01:31:49.987
- Nobody cares about myrrh.
- What are you saying?

01:31:50.125 --> 01:31:51.713
Just because you're jealous
because you gave them

01:31:51.851 --> 01:31:54.094
a basic gift, and I gave them
something to talk about,

01:31:54.232 --> 01:31:56.269
multifaceted...

01:32:13.217 --> 01:32:14.770
You're welcome.

01:32:32.132 --> 01:32:35.066
MARY [VOICE-OVER]:
And as her new family
made their way,

01:32:35.204 --> 01:32:38.311
she knew that her mother
had been right.

01:32:38.449 --> 01:32:40.624
God's plans for her were bigger

01:32:40.762 --> 01:32:43.765
than she could have
ever imagined.

01:32:43.903 --> 01:32:46.319
JOSEPH [VOICE-OVER]:
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:32:46.457 --> 01:32:49.425
That is not how I remember it.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.358
I kissed you first.

01:32:52.912 --> 01:32:55.086
That is the story
of how you came to us.

01:32:56.812 --> 01:32:58.158
Time for your Scripture lesson.

01:32:58.296 --> 01:33:00.885
