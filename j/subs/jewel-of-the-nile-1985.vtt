00:32.573 --> 00:34.866
<i>It was a day like no other.</i>

00:38.537 --> 00:41.248
<i>It was a day I had always dreamed of.</i>

00:42.165 --> 00:44.333
<i>A day I would never forget.</i>

00:46.544 --> 00:50.506
Will you marry this woman
and take her to your heart,

00:50.590 --> 00:53.426
forever devoted and forever young?

00:53.509 --> 00:55.177
I will.

00:55.261 --> 00:59.849
And will you marry this man
and take him to your heart,

00:59.932 --> 01:02.435
forever devoted and forever young?

01:02.518 --> 01:04.477
I will.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.690
Would you now place the ring on her finger?

01:10.902 --> 01:12.570
I now declare...

01:15.948 --> 01:18.868
<i>What a shame we had uninvited guests.</i>

01:21.746 --> 01:24.832
I'll have what I came for this day!

01:27.335 --> 01:29.212
<i>Jack politely asked him to leave.</i>

01:29.545 --> 01:31.421
Kiss steel, bastard!

01:44.684 --> 01:46.394
Jack!

02:03.453 --> 02:05.539
Hold tight! I'm coming!

02:09.501 --> 02:12.546
<i>His temper flared,
but he fought like a gentleman.</i>

02:35.902 --> 02:40.407
<i>My one true love had fought bravely,
but it wasn't enough.</i>

02:52.293 --> 02:54.378
<i>There was only room for one more.</i>

02:54.461 --> 02:57.047
<i>It was either my love or myself.</i>

02:57.131 --> 03:01.510
- You take it, my love.
- Never! Those maggots will not have you.

03:01.677 --> 03:04.305
They will not have me for long.

03:04.388 --> 03:07.682
I have consumption
and will be dead before the year is out.

03:07.765 --> 03:11.896
You were gonna marry me
with consumption? Why didn't you tell me?

03:11.979 --> 03:14.148
I didn't want to spoil things.

03:14.231 --> 03:15.524
- Go.
- No!

03:15.608 --> 03:17.902
Live to fight another day.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.866
Whatever makes you happy.

03:29.537 --> 03:32.874
<i>With Jack, my happiness always came first.</i>

03:34.667 --> 03:36.544
<i>I faced my fate alone.</i>

03:36.711 --> 03:39.756
<i>The 10 turned to 20, the 20 to 40.</i>

03:39.839 --> 03:43.051
<i>Could this be the end of
my freedom, my salvation, my...</i>

03:43.134 --> 03:45.845
Hey, gorgeous!

03:46.638 --> 03:48.932
Hiya, Joanie!

04:02.654 --> 04:04.739
What happened?

04:36.061 --> 04:40.023
"Was this the end of my freedom,
my salvation?"

04:42.484 --> 04:44.570
My career?

05:57.515 --> 05:59.768
Gorgeous day. Huh, gorgeous?

05:59.851 --> 06:02.271
We got blue skies,

06:02.355 --> 06:05.691
nice warm water and a cold beer.

06:08.819 --> 06:10.696
Honey, did you get any more Buds?

06:10.780 --> 06:15.742
No, I just didn't have time today
to ravage the Riviera for your beer.

06:16.701 --> 06:20.038
- Tough day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say it was tough.

06:20.121 --> 06:23.750
But then when the going gets tough,
the tough...

06:26.294 --> 06:28.171
I don't know what the tough do.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.341
I don't know what the pirates do,
or what anybody does.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.928
- Jack...
- Oh, honey. I know, baby. I know.

06:38.055 --> 06:40.975
Look out there. What do you see?

06:41.934 --> 06:43.937
- Bloomingdale's?
- No.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.480
Greece.

06:45.564 --> 06:49.234
Yeah. Mykonos, Lesbos, ouzo, olive oil.
Honey, we're going.

06:49.317 --> 06:53.405
Wait. I thought you said that
we were going back to New York for a while.

06:53.488 --> 06:56.449
Absolutely.
When the summer's over we're going.

06:56.533 --> 07:00.828
Oh, Jack, we've been on this boat
half a year now. I need shore leave.

07:00.911 --> 07:04.498
I promised Gloria I'd finish that book
three months ago, and I can't.

07:04.582 --> 07:06.667
I don't know what happens next.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.545
I thought you wanted
to sail around the world with me.

07:09.628 --> 07:12.840
Well, I do, but not all of it this week.

07:13.257 --> 07:16.051
I mean, Jack, this is just becoming a blur.

07:16.135 --> 07:20.890
Exotic ports and great parties
and spectacular sunsets...

07:20.973 --> 07:22.640
It's not enough.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.976
It's not enough?!

07:25.059 --> 07:29.398
You sound like someone who's got what they
wanted and now don't want what they got.

07:29.481 --> 07:32.985
- I wanna do something serious.
- Serious? Come on!

07:33.068 --> 07:35.487
How much romance can one woman take?

07:35.571 --> 07:37.865
Joan Wilder?

07:40.492 --> 07:42.995
From your most devoted friend.

07:43.704 --> 07:45.788
Thank you.

07:52.086 --> 07:56.341
"This afternoon we shall meet... awaiting
the moment." What's this afternoon?

07:56.424 --> 08:01.262
- Must be somebody coming to the reception.
- That's not till next Tuesday.

08:02.847 --> 08:05.350
This is "next Tuesday", Jack.

08:21.574 --> 08:26.621
- Jack, you said you were getting a car.
- If I knew it was Tuesday, I would've. Sorry.

08:26.704 --> 08:28.790
That's all right.

08:28.873 --> 08:32.210
Whaddaya say we spin that roulette wheel
while we're there?

08:32.292 --> 08:34.378
Sounds great.

08:44.096 --> 08:45.389
Jack.

08:45.472 --> 08:47.349
- Yeah?
- She can't leave now.

08:47.432 --> 08:50.227
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

08:50.310 --> 08:53.815
- Oh, my God.
- I'm your biggest fan!

08:53.898 --> 08:56.233
- I read all your books.
- Thank you.

08:56.316 --> 09:00.571
I'm so happy to see you.

09:00.654 --> 09:03.907
- This is my publisher. Gloria Horne.
- Oh, your publisher.

09:04.491 --> 09:07.411
- And this is...
- You are Mr Wilder?

09:07.995 --> 09:10.831
No, I'm Mr Colton. Jack Colton.

09:10.914 --> 09:13.250
What do you do, Mr Colton?

09:13.333 --> 09:15.419
Casino work.

09:15.502 --> 09:20.089
Yeah. I think I'll go downstairs and punch in.
Excuse me, excuse me.

09:20.172 --> 09:22.675
- But...
- I'll be back!

09:24.176 --> 09:26.429
God, I've got to have a drink!

09:26.512 --> 09:28.973
Literary functions are not Jack's speed.

09:29.056 --> 09:32.978
I mean, his favourite author
is the man who wrote "Pull Tab to Open".

09:33.061 --> 09:36.982
- I am his favourite author.
- You saying it's none of my business?

09:37.065 --> 09:40.110
Let me tell you, Jack is not the marrying kind.

09:40.194 --> 09:44.238
I am worried. You're the girl who
never gets a book back late to the library.

09:44.322 --> 09:49.493
<i>You are three months past your deadline.
What gives? Un scotch, double.</i>

09:49.577 --> 09:54.498
My heart just isn't in it. Romance
just doesn't seem real to me any more.

09:54.582 --> 09:59.128
Real? You don't write "real". You write
about people that sail off into the sunset.

09:59.212 --> 10:03.925
- And the next day when the sun comes up?
- There is no next day in romance.

10:04.008 --> 10:07.344
Stop confusing real life
with a romantic novel.

10:07.719 --> 10:11.306
- Joanie, just finish it.
- I can't.

10:11.389 --> 10:14.434
After 17 books,
I don't know how it ends any more.

10:14.517 --> 10:17.563
Then permit me to tell you.

10:20.858 --> 10:22.944
It doesn't end.

10:23.027 --> 10:26.864
It only begins anew
when you journey down the Nile with me.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.076
- Have you got the right woman?
- No.

10:32.285 --> 10:37.415
My name is Omar Khalifa and I have travelled
1,000 miles to tell you I need you.

10:37.499 --> 10:40.335
- You sent me the flowers.
- They pale by your beauty.

10:40.418 --> 10:42.087
Oh, Mary!

10:42.170 --> 10:46.383
<i>- I read about you.
- Yes, I know. Time magazine.</i>

10:46.466 --> 10:51.054
Well, I'm afraid the Western press
cannot understand the spirit of my vision.

10:51.137 --> 10:54.056
You are a writer. You can understand.

10:54.932 --> 10:58.562
So, Joan Wilder,
you must come and write my story.

10:59.729 --> 11:02.065
I only write romance novels.

11:02.148 --> 11:06.152
Yes. And you haven't finished the one
you're working on right now.

11:06.987 --> 11:11.324
You are a gifted storyteller.
You create heroes in a world of cynics.

11:11.575 --> 11:15.453
Journey down the Nile with me
and I'll give you a chance to record history.

11:15.537 --> 11:18.080
- Come. We must leave today.
- Joanie!

11:18.664 --> 11:23.752
In just four nights I will become Emperor,
and you will have the exclusive story.

11:23.836 --> 11:26.672
- They have emperors on the Nile?
- They do now.

11:27.548 --> 11:29.633
Oh, shit.

11:49.445 --> 11:51.530
So now what are we celebrating?

11:51.614 --> 11:54.116
- The Nile!
- Oh, the Nile.

11:54.325 --> 11:56.202
We've been invited to Africa.

11:57.077 --> 11:59.205
Jack Colton, Omar Khalifa.

11:59.955 --> 12:02.249
How do you do?

12:02.333 --> 12:08.504
He's asked me - me - to write his story.
It's just what I've always wanted to do!

12:08.588 --> 12:12.926
And now Joan's work will receive
the serious attention that it deserves.

12:13.009 --> 12:16.054
And this will be her biggest accomplishment:

12:16.137 --> 12:18.223
My biography.

12:18.890 --> 12:22.394
What's so important there
that you have to write the book now?

12:22.478 --> 12:24.980
- Mr Khalifa has...
- Omar, please.

12:25.564 --> 12:29.817
Omar has been chosen
to unite the tribes of the Nile

12:30.068 --> 12:32.987
and end the strife that has bloodied his land.

12:33.071 --> 12:36.241
He will carry on the work of
the missing Great Redeemer.

12:36.324 --> 12:40.203
- You have listened very well.
- You got all that in 20 minutes?

12:42.121 --> 12:46.125
As a friend of Miss Wilder's,
you are welcome to be my guest also.

12:46.668 --> 12:48.753
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.549
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

12:59.263 --> 13:01.348
I thought you wanted to go to New York.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.725
- That's all changed.
- That fast?

13:03.809 --> 13:08.106
But to write a biography -
it's something important, something real.

13:08.189 --> 13:12.360
- This is what I've been looking for.
- Isn't it a little bit over your head?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.945
I think it's a great chance.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.114
So you got your heart set on it?

13:21.994 --> 13:24.454
Mine's set on Greece.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.044
So when are you gonna leave?

13:32.212 --> 13:34.965
Tonight. He has a private jet and...

13:35.048 --> 13:37.341
Oh, he's got a private jet.

13:39.468 --> 13:42.972
- Oh, what the hell. We had a good run.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.850
This is just five or four weeks of research.

13:45.933 --> 13:48.729
Maybe you're right. Maybe we need a break.

13:48.812 --> 13:51.231
It's been kind of tough lately.

13:51.315 --> 13:54.860
Yeah. When the going gets tough,
the tough go to Greece.

13:58.864 --> 14:02.116
- Well, I'll write you.
- Where?

14:03.868 --> 14:05.661
Yeah.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.622
Where?

14:20.426 --> 14:24.387
I think I'll go down and
give that roulette wheel one more chance.

14:34.398 --> 14:36.484
You take care of yourself.

14:38.986 --> 14:41.072
And you stay out of trouble.

14:51.831 --> 14:53.708
Look out for her, will ya?

14:53.792 --> 14:58.004
I can offer you this comfort:
She leaves you for a higher purpose.

15:01.299 --> 15:03.176
Yeah.

15:18.441 --> 15:20.527
<i>Free Al-Jawhara!</i>

15:50.180 --> 15:54.477
Don't be frightened. You know,
a man of vision has many enemies.

15:54.561 --> 15:58.522
And my destiny is to outsmart them.
You see?

15:59.481 --> 16:01.567
Like it?

16:02.026 --> 16:04.361
It's OK.

16:46.694 --> 16:49.906
Well, sweetheart, I guess it's just you and me.

16:49.989 --> 16:52.784
Goddamn it, she was the best time I ever had.

16:53.159 --> 16:55.995
Don't cry, scumbag! I'll keep you company.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.877
Cartagena, Colombia!
Long time no... Oh, shit.

17:02.961 --> 17:06.964
- Go ahead. Gimme a reason. Make my year!
- Hey, go easy with the gun.

17:07.048 --> 17:11.718
Did you miss me? I missed you.
You're all I thought about for six months.

17:11.969 --> 17:16.765
They threw me in a jail filled with rejects
from the communicable disease ward.

17:17.015 --> 17:21.771
Every wacko, drippy,
open-sored lowlife was in that joint!

17:21.855 --> 17:24.315
All wanting to be my proctologist.

17:24.566 --> 17:27.819
And rats! I'm full of rat bites.

17:28.987 --> 17:33.991
Ten weeks of rabies shots this long and
all I thought of was you, Colton. Just you!

17:34.074 --> 17:38.662
Well, I'm flattered, pal.
And I'm sorry you had such a tough time.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.999
How about 100 bucks?

17:42.082 --> 17:46.003
I'll give you a one-way ticket to Harp Land!
What'd you do with it?

17:46.086 --> 17:49.381
- What are you talking about?
- The stone, moron! I'm cocked!

17:49.464 --> 17:54.260
- Let's talk about this like gentlemen.
- Gentlemen! Did I tell you I got malaria?

17:54.343 --> 17:58.806
Every time I shake, I shake like this. Know
what happens if I shake my trigger finger?

17:58.890 --> 18:02.936
And I feel an attack coming on!
Know what happens if that happens?

18:03.020 --> 18:05.856
It's the end of Mr Lucky. That's the end of...

18:06.440 --> 18:08.692
Holy shit!

18:09.693 --> 18:13.030
Quiet! Next time you'll not be so lucky.

18:13.113 --> 18:17.075
- I am Tarak. You must come with me now.
- What the hell are you?

18:17.159 --> 18:20.953
<i>- Omar steal our jewel. Al-Jawhara.
- Jewel?</i>

18:21.037 --> 18:25.583
You were invited with the woman. You can
get into Omar's palace. My people cannot.

18:25.666 --> 18:30.463
- What people? What are you talking about?
- You must help me find the Jewel.

18:30.546 --> 18:32.924
- What jewel?
- The Jewel of the Nile.

18:33.007 --> 18:35.509
- Our most priceless jewel.
- Oh, that jewel.

18:35.593 --> 18:39.347
Omar has stolen my people's jewel.
Omar is a very bad man.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.515
Oh, that scum! I spit on him!

18:41.598 --> 18:45.228
Jack, buddy, let's help this nice man
get his jewel back.

18:45.311 --> 18:48.898
- Yes.
- Look, I don't know where you're from,

18:48.981 --> 18:51.067
but I'm sailing my boat tonight.

18:51.150 --> 18:55.613
No, you must come to help find the Jewel
now before Omar kill many people.

18:55.905 --> 18:59.700
As long as Omar have the Jewel,
nothing can stop him.

18:59.784 --> 19:03.829
Look, I'm going on the boat.
You guys can do what you want.

19:09.376 --> 19:11.253
The boat blew up!

19:13.630 --> 19:15.507
My boat blew up.

19:15.590 --> 19:17.634
The boat blew up!

19:17.717 --> 19:19.803
Everything's gone.

19:22.013 --> 19:25.517
Who are you? The Prince of Darkness?
Don't you got any friends?

19:25.684 --> 19:27.769
This is the work of Omar.

19:29.187 --> 19:33.066
- Omar blew up my boat, huh?
- Your woman is in danger, too.

19:33.149 --> 19:35.151
I will take you to him.

19:35.235 --> 19:37.737
- I'm coming, too.
- The hell you are!

19:38.321 --> 19:41.324
Look, you owe me, Colton.

19:41.408 --> 19:44.119
So wherever you're going, I'm going.

19:45.412 --> 19:47.706
Where we going?

19:47.789 --> 19:49.332
Africa.

20:19.904 --> 20:23.157
- Do you recognise my home?
- I wrote this!

20:23.240 --> 20:28.495
<i>Yes! In The Return of the King.
I had the same uniforms designed.</i>

20:41.090 --> 20:43.384
Hello. Hi!

20:46.471 --> 20:49.849
- Is all this yours?
- It belongs to the country. To my people.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.810
Oh.

20:56.857 --> 20:58.984
Why point out the negative?

20:59.068 --> 21:02.111
In three nights in Kadir
the moon will be full,

21:02.195 --> 21:07.700
and all my people will unite behind me
in peace and none of this will be necessary.

21:07.784 --> 21:12.247
- Now let me show you my humble house.
- Thank you.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.838
I'm really blessed. My people love me.

21:20.922 --> 21:24.591
Well, yes. They seem very... enthusiastic.

21:31.223 --> 21:35.812
Oh, this is a good shot for you -
the little boy holding up my picture.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.981
Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

22:00.085 --> 22:01.753
My humble house.

22:01.837 --> 22:04.464
You must forgive us. We are a poor people.

22:14.390 --> 22:17.019
Everything you need, they will bring you.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.562
Oh, thank you.

22:18.645 --> 22:22.649
Here only strangers say thank you.
Family and friends have no need.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.612
What was that?

22:26.695 --> 22:28.780
Cats. Come.

22:31.116 --> 22:32.784
I have a cat.

22:40.374 --> 22:42.460
I hope this is satisfactory.

22:44.003 --> 22:47.298
Oh, yes, this is OK. Fine.

22:47.381 --> 22:49.926
Here you'll write your masterpiece.

22:50.009 --> 22:52.220
Ah, I have a few questions...

22:52.303 --> 22:55.806
I see the writer is already at work. Good.

22:56.891 --> 22:59.310
Explore your new world.

22:59.393 --> 23:02.813
Feel free to go anywhere and see anything.

23:03.147 --> 23:05.233
Talk to anyone.

23:05.816 --> 23:09.570
I'm glad you're here, Joan.
Together we'll make history.

24:07.085 --> 24:09.170
It's like a fishbowl!

24:09.253 --> 24:13.841
Why do these Third World cesspools
always gotta be so hot, will you tell me that?

24:16.093 --> 24:18.179
Hey, where the hell you going?

24:23.643 --> 24:25.729
Holy shit!

24:42.828 --> 24:47.416
Well, Colton, looks like
we've hitched our wagon to a star.

25:16.362 --> 25:18.447
Stop that! Stop it!

25:27.121 --> 25:29.207
Excuse me?

25:30.291 --> 25:32.752
What does this mean?

25:36.840 --> 25:40.093
- Do you speak English?
- "Give back the Jewel."

25:40.677 --> 25:44.179
<i>- Give back the jewel?
- Yeah. Eid lana Al-Jawhara.</i>

25:49.060 --> 25:51.563
You can't do that! I'm a professional.

26:00.405 --> 26:02.490
We'll see about that.

26:04.409 --> 26:07.786
<i>If you don't tell me
what the hell is going on here,</i>

26:07.870 --> 26:12.082
- I'll be on the first plane back to New York.
- It's impossible.

26:12.666 --> 26:17.754
Tomorrow we journey to Kadir. You must be
there. It will be your most important chapter.

26:17.838 --> 26:21.884
- I can't write if you keep secrets from me.
- What secrets?

26:24.720 --> 26:26.805
What is the Jewel?

26:29.098 --> 26:31.435
The Jewel is a legend.

26:31.518 --> 26:33.604
I am real.

26:34.188 --> 26:37.608
Do not be distracted
from your mission, Joan Wilder.

26:38.317 --> 26:40.402
Make yourself comfortable.

26:40.944 --> 26:43.906
You stay with me until our book is done.

26:43.989 --> 26:46.074
You can't keep me here!

26:48.827 --> 26:50.913
Go. You are free to leave.

26:54.123 --> 26:58.252
Only the worst kind of fool
would attempt our desert alone.

27:08.596 --> 27:12.851
I gotta get off this camel.
It's breaking my ass! Colton!

27:12.935 --> 27:15.520
- You gotta hang on and take it.
- I can't.

27:15.603 --> 27:19.065
- The camp's coming up.
- Shit!

27:34.372 --> 27:36.457
You are welcome!

27:38.084 --> 27:40.710
We have food! We have drink!

27:40.794 --> 27:42.879
You got a toilet?

27:47.759 --> 27:50.053
So how big is this jewel?

27:55.768 --> 27:58.855
Very, very big. Very big. Very, very big.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.106
Very big.

28:01.274 --> 28:03.984
It's as big as this orange?

28:11.741 --> 28:15.620
- It's as big as an orange.
- The Jewel is the heart of our people.

28:15.787 --> 28:18.206
Omar steals the heart of our people.

28:18.290 --> 28:20.584
- Omar is thief.
- Omar is very bad man.

28:20.917 --> 28:23.920
Before Omar steal Jewel, everything good.

28:24.004 --> 28:25.921
Now everything is shit!

28:34.555 --> 28:39.311
You help us find the Jewel,
and we give you great reward.

28:39.394 --> 28:42.731
But if you lie to us, you die.

28:44.482 --> 28:46.443
But now we dance!

29:21.435 --> 29:23.521
Look at these guys, Colton.

29:23.604 --> 29:25.689
No sheep is safe tonight.

29:37.116 --> 29:40.954
We split it right down the middle,
Colton. 50-50.

29:41.037 --> 29:43.122
What are you talking about?

29:43.206 --> 29:45.750
Don't play stupid with me, partner.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.710
The Jewel.

29:47.794 --> 29:50.588
And don't you even think of
messing with me.

29:56.261 --> 30:00.180
Oh, what's that I hear?
A heart breaking? You sap!

30:00.264 --> 30:02.141
Keep your mind on business.

30:02.225 --> 30:06.813
You'll wind up getting yourself killed
over some broad who dumped you.

30:08.690 --> 30:10.358
Jewels!

30:10.441 --> 30:12.777
Oh, Omar!

30:41.471 --> 30:44.017
I want you lot to be careful!

30:44.767 --> 30:49.897
See that word "Fragile" on the side?
It means don't drop... Why don't you listen?

30:49.980 --> 30:54.735
I might love your country, your culture,
and even your people! That means I love you!

30:54.818 --> 30:58.614
But you drop one more of my boxes,
and I'll smash your bloody face in!

31:01.033 --> 31:06.079
You tell Omar, right - Omar -
that his special-effects wizard has arrived!

31:06.163 --> 31:08.248
Come on, then.

32:34.499 --> 32:37.377
War plans? Oh, my God! What is he up to?

32:42.924 --> 32:45.676
<i>Wait till Time magazine sees this.</i>

33:10.159 --> 33:12.661
You bastard! You burnt my hand!

33:12.745 --> 33:17.708
I didn't say it wouldn't burn.
I said it wouldn't hurt! There's no blistering.

33:17.791 --> 33:22.296
- I've done it hundreds of times on stage.
- This is not a cheap theatrical stunt!

33:22.379 --> 33:27.676
- It's a miracle! My people have to believe it!
- Omar, trust me. Trust what I've got to say.

33:27.760 --> 33:32.722
Look, if I can make gods out of rock'n'roll
stars, imagine what I can do for you.

33:32.805 --> 33:36.769
For your information,
I am not a rock'n'roll star!

33:36.852 --> 33:40.147
The people must believe
I have the same powers as the Jewel.

33:40.231 --> 33:42.566
Come! I want to see him now.

33:42.650 --> 33:46.862
If it weren't for the Jewel,
I'd have led my people to power long ago.

33:56.246 --> 34:01.292
Westerners understand nothing. The Jewel
represents the spiritual world of my people.

34:01.376 --> 34:05.964
Unless I convince them I am their spiritual
leader, they will never follow me into battle.

34:06.047 --> 34:08.132
That is why you are here.

34:33.074 --> 34:37.203
- Tell me how it's done, magician.
- It's not magic trick. It's miracle.

34:38.496 --> 34:40.873
I am losing patience with you.

34:40.956 --> 34:44.918
But you cannot kill me.
Even you are superstitious.

34:45.002 --> 34:47.670
<i>Al-Jawhara lives.</i>

34:47.754 --> 34:50.841
Two nights from now it will not matter.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.442
Oh, no.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.781
A woman?

35:15.032 --> 35:18.076
- Most unexpected.
- I gotta get outta here.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.245
I gotta stop Omar.

35:20.496 --> 35:23.290
Did you bring an army?

35:23.373 --> 35:27.585
<i>- No. I'm just Joan Wilder.
- Just-Joan Wilder, I'm Al-Jawhara.</i>

35:30.379 --> 35:32.840
The Jewel of the Nile.

35:33.174 --> 35:35.510
I don't understand.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.971
- You are the Jewel?!
- Yes. For the moment.

35:39.055 --> 35:43.977
In two nights at the holy city of Kadir
Omar will proclaim himself Emperor.

35:44.061 --> 35:48.106
Without me to oppose him, he'll march
across North Africa like a madman.

35:49.733 --> 35:52.568
But the world will see me
as the saviour of my people.

35:52.652 --> 35:57.532
No, it won't. The world won't believe you.
I've been in your office and seen your vision.

35:57.615 --> 35:59.992
- I'll write the truth about you.
- The truth?

36:00.326 --> 36:03.371
<i>If I wanted the truth,
I would have hired 60 Minutes.</i>

36:03.454 --> 36:06.499
What do you know about truth?
You fantasise everything.

36:06.582 --> 36:12.004
<i>Why do you think I brought you here? You
stay here and write what I tell you to write!</i>

36:13.631 --> 36:17.801
- You think no one knows I'm here?
- Oh, yes, Jack! I forgot to tell you.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.595
Jack is dead.

36:21.555 --> 36:25.393
Don't be ridiculous.
Jack would never die without telling me.

36:25.726 --> 36:27.812
Nevertheless, he is dead.

36:34.735 --> 36:39.406
You look pale, Miss Wilder.
I'll send you my personal physician.

36:45.787 --> 36:48.206
It can't be true.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.340
This Jack... He is friend for you?

36:58.842 --> 37:00.593
Yes.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.761
He is my best friend.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.195
What? I don't see shit!

37:19.362 --> 37:21.364
We must stop here.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.492
It is dangerous for Sufis to enter Omar's city.

37:25.075 --> 37:27.786
Now, wait. He's already tried to kill me once.

37:29.955 --> 37:32.249
You are guest of Omar.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.961
Find for us the Jewel. Accept your destiny.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.299
Destiny, my ass! Excuse me.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.220
When you hook up with jujubes,
see what happens.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.265
Just take your lead from me, and we'll be fine.

37:48.724 --> 37:53.187
- We gonna walk through the centre of town?
- I'm gonna put you up a camel's ass.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.939
I might like it.

38:00.569 --> 38:03.155
- What are you doing?
- In one of my books,

38:03.239 --> 38:05.324
<i>Angelina's Savage Secret,</i>

38:05.407 --> 38:10.079
she used her nailfile to cut
the mortar away from the window box.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.747
How long did this take?

38:12.831 --> 38:14.791
Two pages.

38:14.874 --> 38:19.504
But... it's not the bars
that make the prison. It is the desert.

38:19.587 --> 38:23.424
So I'll travel at night. I don't care.
I have to stop Omar.

38:23.508 --> 38:26.261
I gotta get out to write the truth about him.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.429
I have to get to Kadir.

38:28.972 --> 38:32.434
Wait a minute.
You are the one that has to get to Kadir.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.854
You are the only one that can stop Omar.
You have to go with me!

38:38.606 --> 38:40.900
Maybe you are the one.

38:42.986 --> 38:44.445
I accept.

38:44.821 --> 38:46.906
We are sworn, Just-Joan.

38:48.950 --> 38:52.245
- Right. But it's just Joan.
- Right. Just-Joan.

38:52.328 --> 38:55.999
- Right. We just have to get out this window.
- Please.

39:01.253 --> 39:04.173
- Magic!
- Dry rot.

39:06.216 --> 39:12.265
I bet you could pick up a swell three-bedroom
town house here for about five or six dollars.

39:15.226 --> 39:16.978
Hi. My name is Colton.

39:17.061 --> 39:20.773
I've been invited by your Omar.
I'm here to see Joan Wilder.

39:23.609 --> 39:26.111
Hey, Rachid! How are you?
Good to see you again.

39:26.195 --> 39:28.405
Joan Wilder does not want to see you.

39:32.701 --> 39:35.913
Well, now, Rachid,
I don't think you understand.

39:37.498 --> 39:42.002
We're here on official business.
This is Mr... Fatush from the US Embassy.

39:42.085 --> 39:46.214
He's got something very important
to talk to all you guys about.

39:50.593 --> 39:53.930
Look, we don't want to
create an international incident here.

39:54.013 --> 39:57.142
I mean, after all, she is an American citizen.

39:57.226 --> 40:01.396
If you'll just let us see her, no paperwork.
Mum's the word. Everything...

40:03.941 --> 40:07.444
Guys, no sweat, OK?
We'll catch you next time we're in town.

40:07.528 --> 40:09.862
- Take it easy.
- Say hello to her for us.

40:09.946 --> 40:13.699
You know what they say: Once
they've had a holy man, they never go back.

40:14.283 --> 40:18.496
- Quickly, Just-Joan!
- Are you sure you know where you're going?

40:23.751 --> 40:26.796
Those guys can go for hours
without coming up for air.

40:26.879 --> 40:30.967
Ease up, will ya?
All right, there's gotta be another way in here.

40:31.050 --> 40:36.889
I can't wait for another smooth move. How
about us at the back door in pussycat suits?

40:36.973 --> 40:40.852
- When they come with the milk...
- How about you takin' it in the ear!?

40:40.935 --> 40:44.147
Look, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't be on to this.

40:44.355 --> 40:47.275
Subsequently I should shoot you
the first chance I get!

40:47.358 --> 40:48.901
Jack!

40:49.318 --> 40:51.404
You're alive!

40:51.487 --> 40:53.656
Kinda goin' outta your way to duck me!

40:53.739 --> 40:56.116
You bastard!

41:04.708 --> 41:07.586
Oh, Jack! I thought I'd never see you again.

41:07.669 --> 41:11.631
They told me you were dead.
I never wanna feel that way again.

41:12.090 --> 41:14.885
Does this mean you apologise?

41:14.968 --> 41:19.139
<i>I feel like I'm back in eighth grade.
Is this The Young and the Stupid?</i>

41:19.222 --> 41:23.602
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Don't get cagey with me. I'm on to it.

41:23.685 --> 41:25.770
I know how you two operate.

41:28.190 --> 41:31.318
I'll get in there with or without you dinks!

41:40.118 --> 41:45.206
Hey, look, guys! Lighten up!
I'm only saying hello to an old girlfriend here!

41:45.289 --> 41:49.043
- Just-Joan, we need to go!
- Wait a minute, who's this guy?

41:49.126 --> 41:52.463
- He's a friend.
- You made friends in there?

42:08.771 --> 42:11.732
- OK. Let's go, come on!
- Wait. He's coming with us.

42:12.900 --> 42:16.695
Don't start with me! I've come
halfway across Africa to rescue you.

42:16.779 --> 42:19.573
Rescue me? I was doing fine without you.

42:21.367 --> 42:24.703
- I am guide. I can help.
- I don't need a guide. I need a miracle!

42:24.787 --> 42:26.872
Jack, he's coming with us.

42:30.667 --> 42:34.963
All right. But if we get out of this alive,
I'm gonna kill you.

42:35.046 --> 42:36.506
Let's go.

43:11.291 --> 43:13.877
- Who are you?
- Is this where Al Jolson's buried?

43:13.960 --> 43:16.712
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't provoke me, pal!

43:16.795 --> 43:21.383
<i>I had a tough day. You know
how hot it is here? It's 120º in the shade.</i>

43:23.510 --> 43:26.890
I'm like this with Weinberger.
We'll be all over you!

43:34.856 --> 43:36.733
Let me in!

43:38.817 --> 43:40.944
Holy shit and shove me in it.

44:13.310 --> 44:15.395
Oh, no. Over the wall!

44:49.261 --> 44:51.639
Excuse me. Excuse me.

44:55.518 --> 44:57.395
Come on!

44:57.478 --> 44:59.147
No! No!

45:03.818 --> 45:06.863
OK, flyboy,
your estimated time of departure is now!

45:25.589 --> 45:28.550
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything!

45:29.593 --> 45:33.181
- Well, do something!
- All right. I'm trying!

45:36.349 --> 45:38.727
I mean, this isn't Space Invaders!

45:44.816 --> 45:47.736
- Jack, the wall!
- Oh, no!

46:28.150 --> 46:32.321
- It is Space Invaders!
- That'll show 'em!

46:42.081 --> 46:43.999
All right, yeah!

46:44.750 --> 46:47.460
Oh, shit!

46:49.629 --> 46:51.714
Let's get outta here!

47:07.398 --> 47:09.482
This is gonna be tight!

47:14.404 --> 47:16.656
This is my first time in airplane.

47:29.335 --> 47:31.671
How do you stop this thing?

47:38.010 --> 47:39.887
Sorry!

47:48.146 --> 47:50.982
- Do you know where you're going?
- Give me a break!

48:35.859 --> 48:38.695
- Your friend steal the Jewel.
- What?

48:43.366 --> 48:46.452
- You! You are liar to me!
- No!

48:46.911 --> 48:49.205
I come back and you're dead!

48:54.210 --> 48:57.380
You thieving bastard!
You ain't stiffin' me again!

48:57.463 --> 49:00.842
I promise ya.
I'll feed ya to the maggots! I'll get...

50:00.442 --> 50:02.319
Great! We're out of quarters.

50:02.402 --> 50:04.529
Well, try that one there.

50:10.118 --> 50:12.204
Now what?

50:12.662 --> 50:14.748
Damn it!

50:24.507 --> 50:26.258
Yes!

50:27.092 --> 50:29.763
Hey, that's not bad for your first time.

51:04.129 --> 51:06.256
Come on, we'll get him. We'll get him.

51:06.339 --> 51:08.883
Colton, you ain't gettin' away.

51:29.821 --> 51:31.906
Where the hell's the horn?

51:33.158 --> 51:35.910
Get outta here! Get out of the way!

51:54.094 --> 51:55.555
Sandstorm.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.109
Stop!

52:08.485 --> 52:10.862
What are you gonna do?

52:12.405 --> 52:14.990
Either save us or kill us. Hang on!

53:16.217 --> 53:19.179
- Now you are dead.
- No! Don't cut off my head!

53:19.263 --> 53:23.307
- You stole our jewel.
- It was the mook! He's always screwin' me.

53:23.391 --> 53:26.352
I swear to God on my eyes
I never seen that jewel!

53:27.979 --> 53:30.606
No, wait, wait!

53:30.690 --> 53:33.234
You need me. I can help you find him.

53:33.317 --> 53:38.239
- You are his friend.
- No! No friend. Stop saying that.

53:38.322 --> 53:40.658
Friends don't stab each other in the back.

53:40.741 --> 53:45.371
Come on. Look, we'll team up.
We'll find him, we'll get him good.

53:45.454 --> 53:49.749
He knows that I will not be denied!
Colton's future is bleak!

53:50.417 --> 53:52.502
<i>Very bleak!</i>

53:55.464 --> 53:57.340
Any idea where we are?

53:57.424 --> 54:02.388
The best I can figure out is that we head
due east. We should make it to the border.

54:02.472 --> 54:08.060
<i>- Well... is that the way to Kadir?
- La. Kadir is in the west, over that mountain.</i>

54:08.186 --> 54:11.730
Well, the best of luck to you, pal.
Joan, let's get going.

54:11.813 --> 54:13.982
Jack, we have to take him to Kadir.

54:15.275 --> 54:18.737
What are you talkin' about?
We got him out, like you said. Come on.

54:18.820 --> 54:21.948
We swore an oath, Just-Joan and I.
We go to Kadir.

54:23.450 --> 54:25.952
What is it with you?!

54:26.036 --> 54:30.749
Jesus! Everything's always gotta be
your way? It's just like the goddamn boat!

54:30.832 --> 54:35.252
What do you mean "my way"? It wasn't
my idea to spend six months on your boat!

54:35.336 --> 54:39.799
- Oh, debate good. I enjoy.
- OK, let me tell you what I put up with.

54:40.174 --> 54:44.429
We're moored off the Canary Islands.
Midnight, sound asleep.

54:44.513 --> 54:47.140
Three crazed Joan Wilder fans

54:47.224 --> 54:50.685
<i>decide they want the anchor
of the Angelina for a souvenir!</i>

54:50.769 --> 54:56.191
- We were drifting for days! And the other...
- Stop. I'm sorry. It's time for Just-Joan.

54:56.274 --> 54:59.443
- Remember the Costa del Sol, Jack?
- Oh, come on!

54:59.527 --> 55:02.363
He's gotta meet me
at the governor's for dinner.

55:02.446 --> 55:07.409
And you show up with the entire
national basketball team!

55:07.493 --> 55:09.370
They were hungry.

55:09.453 --> 55:13.082
This is what I'm talking about.
Sometimes you could think about me.

55:13.165 --> 55:17.419
Oh, I suppose you were thinking all about me
when you took off with Omar?

55:17.503 --> 55:19.588
- He blew up my boat!
- Our boat?

55:19.672 --> 55:23.550
- Oh, now it's our boat?
- Good debate. It's equal, no winners.

55:23.633 --> 55:26.929
- Just-Joan, we must hurry.
- Wait. He blew up our boat?

55:27.012 --> 55:30.266
Why are you risking your life for this guy?

55:31.600 --> 55:35.437
I made a commitment. I can't break it.

55:39.316 --> 55:41.986
OK. Fine.

55:42.069 --> 55:45.864
But I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I didn't come here for you anyway. No!

55:45.947 --> 55:49.033
I'm on to something big.

55:49.659 --> 55:54.664
<i>- A jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.
- Come with us. I am Jawhara!</i>

55:55.665 --> 55:58.960
- That means Joe.
- Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.

55:59.419 --> 56:02.422
I wouldn't want her
to break her commitment.

56:03.131 --> 56:05.216
Oh, Jack...

56:05.633 --> 56:07.718
Come on.

56:46.006 --> 56:48.091
<i>That's for the Angelina.</i>

56:49.218 --> 56:51.304
I still owe you for Joan.

56:54.890 --> 56:59.561
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Please, let me get out of this alive.

56:59.686 --> 57:03.690
I swear to God
I'll be a good boy from tomorrow on.

57:09.196 --> 57:11.281
But tonight I gotta kill Colton.

57:25.086 --> 57:27.505
<i>Heydi Joan Wilder!</i>

57:41.602 --> 57:45.356
- Why you didn't tell your friend about me?
- Oh, I know him.

57:45.940 --> 57:50.403
He'd go halfway round the world for a party.
He wouldn't cross town for a noble cause.

57:50.486 --> 57:54.448
- People can surprise you.
- No, he's just Jack. He'll never change.

57:54.532 --> 57:56.617
Like a...

57:57.201 --> 57:59.328
Like a stone.

57:59.412 --> 58:03.166
It's always a stone. Open your hand.

58:04.416 --> 58:07.669
Change is not always visible.

58:07.836 --> 58:11.006
- Let's show some hustle!
- What?

58:11.089 --> 58:15.051
Your buddy Omar!
What is it? He can't live without you?

58:18.890 --> 58:21.726
- Are we jogging?
- We are jogging.

58:34.488 --> 58:36.990
Greece is looking better and better.

58:46.041 --> 58:48.126
Oh, shit!

58:49.586 --> 58:52.505
Just tell me why this guy wants you so bad.

58:53.422 --> 58:55.883
- Hey, Joe, where you going?
- This way.

58:55.966 --> 58:59.304
- You gotta be kidding.
- He knows the mountains better than you.

58:59.387 --> 59:01.473
Joan, will you give me a break?

59:01.556 --> 59:03.975
America - democracy. We vote, huh?

59:58.487 --> 01:00:00.573
Stop!

01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:14.669
Hurry up. Let's go!

01:00:15.587 --> 01:00:16.838
Get down!

01:00:21.092 --> 01:00:23.179
It's a black day for democracy.

01:00:24.596 --> 01:00:28.641
- Do not worry. It's not my destiny to die here.
- What about us?

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.437
That's another ball game.

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:43.615
Rachid!

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:49.828
Joan Wilder!

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:52.289
I wish no harm to you!

01:00:52.706 --> 01:00:55.292
I'm your friend! Your fan!

01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:58.045
Please surrender!

01:00:58.128 --> 01:01:02.299
What did you do for this guy Omar
you never did for me?

01:01:02.382 --> 01:01:04.468
Bloody bitch!

01:01:14.186 --> 01:01:16.271
Oh, shit! Look out!

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.639
Hey, Omar! Eat rocks!

01:01:52.558 --> 01:01:54.059
Let's go.

01:02:22.836 --> 01:02:24.921
I got something.

01:02:29.009 --> 01:02:31.179
Nubians.

01:02:31.262 --> 01:02:33.598
I was hoping to avoid them.

01:02:40.646 --> 01:02:42.732
Sell any books here?

01:02:46.067 --> 01:02:49.738
- Main man! Hey, my man!
- What are you so happy about?

01:02:49.821 --> 01:02:54.075
<i>Just keep smiling. Maybe they'll think
we're from National Geographic.</i>

01:03:00.248 --> 01:03:02.334
Hey! How ya doin'?

01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:36.700
He says it's many days'
long trip over high mountains.

01:03:36.784 --> 01:03:39.411
And he wishes us a very pleasant journey.

01:03:41.497 --> 01:03:43.833
Thank you.

01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:48.045
All right. Thank you, guys.
Catch you next time. Goodbye.

01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:50.214
Come on, Jack.

01:03:52.925 --> 01:03:59.140
Ah, Mr Jack! Just-Joan! The Chief's son, he
wishes to make a blessing for your marriage.

01:04:01.267 --> 01:04:03.727
We're not married.

01:04:24.372 --> 01:04:29.669
He says, because you are not married,
that his son wishes to court you.

01:04:30.086 --> 01:04:32.589
- Oh, I just...
- Oh, no, that's...

01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:37.928
That's very nice, but the lady is...
She's with me.

01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:49.439
He says that because there is more than
one suitor, that you must wrestle his son.

01:04:49.773 --> 01:04:51.858
I gotta wrestle his son?

01:04:56.946 --> 01:04:59.032
How ya doin'?

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.746
OK. This one I think I can handle.

01:05:05.412 --> 01:05:07.289
OK!

01:05:12.127 --> 01:05:13.378
No?

01:05:13.962 --> 01:05:16.048
<i>Hussein!</i>

01:05:35.984 --> 01:05:39.738
Wait a minute, guys.
Let's talk this over like gentlemen!

01:05:42.324 --> 01:05:44.785
All right. You guys are with me, huh?

01:05:44.868 --> 01:05:46.829
Yeah, me. All right.

01:05:46.912 --> 01:05:50.916
Do me a favour. Tell him
we lived together for six months. Shit.

01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:53.334
All right, what are the rules?

01:06:17.817 --> 01:06:19.986
Right.

01:06:31.581 --> 01:06:33.583
I'm sorry about that.

01:06:36.335 --> 01:06:38.588
No, not the left one! No!

01:06:42.674 --> 01:06:45.553
No pain, no gain.

01:06:45.636 --> 01:06:47.722
Let me go!

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.355
- No!
- Can we talk about this?

01:06:57.315 --> 01:06:59.400
Stop it!

01:06:59.901 --> 01:07:01.986
We have to do something!

01:07:02.694 --> 01:07:04.780
I am doing something.

01:07:25.926 --> 01:07:28.011
Joe, he's...

01:08:31.657 --> 01:08:35.910
- That was great!
- Great, huh? I could've gotten killed!

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:37.013
This is the marriage dance. In this tribe,
the women, they choose the man.

01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:41.810
And then, according to the custom,
they will be together for life.

01:09:41.893 --> 01:09:44.270
They get all that from one dance?

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:46.022
It's beautiful!

01:09:51.484 --> 01:09:56.281
Ralph, if you want to be one of us,
take off your shoes and socks.

01:09:57.116 --> 01:10:00.869
If you want to be one of us,
you must see with the eyes of your heart,

01:10:00.953 --> 01:10:03.747
- not with the eyes of your head.
- Gotcha, yeah.

01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:07.084
Your heart will never give you fear or pain -

01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:09.253
if you know our way.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.089
Ralph.

01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:16.510
No, thanks, pal. Keep your friggin' jewel.

01:10:16.593 --> 01:10:18.679
- No!
- Are you afraid?

01:10:19.596 --> 01:10:21.473
I just had my feet resoled.

01:10:21.765 --> 01:10:25.936
- What is the worst that can happen to you?
- I could wind up a Chicken McNugget.

01:10:26.019 --> 01:10:31.900
- What is the best that could happen to you?
- I could get through this and find the Jewel.

01:10:31.984 --> 01:10:34.068
It's your choice.

01:10:34.152 --> 01:10:36.237
Look down.

01:10:40.158 --> 01:10:41.826
Hot coals!

01:10:45.538 --> 01:10:47.665
I did it! I did it! I'm one of us!

01:11:15.193 --> 01:11:17.278
All right! Yeah!

01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:45.430
Your fears - they make you foolish.

01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:54.564
Go to her, Jack.

01:13:16.728 --> 01:13:20.690
- I'm sorry I got people shooting at you again.
- You kidding?

01:13:20.774 --> 01:13:24.110
We're the perfect couple
when we got people shooting at us.

01:13:24.194 --> 01:13:28.907
- Just the slow times I'm not too good at.
- I guess I just expect too much.

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:31.075
Maybe we both expect too much.

01:13:34.287 --> 01:13:36.372
Oh, boy.

01:13:38.082 --> 01:13:40.501
Thank you for coming to Kadir with me.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.073
This valley is gift of the Nile.

01:14:19.706 --> 01:14:21.875
I've been away from here too long.

01:14:26.213 --> 01:14:29.883
You know, I'm getting to like this guy Joe.
He's growing on me.

01:14:29.967 --> 01:14:33.303
What do you say we cut him in
on this jewel, if we ever find it?

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:35.472
Jack...

01:14:36.265 --> 01:14:38.350
We have the Jewel.

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:41.520
What are you talking about? Where?

01:14:42.104 --> 01:14:44.398
Well, there.

01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:50.154
- What, Joe's got the Jewel?
- No.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.698
Joe is the Jewel.

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.579
Joe is the Jewel of the Nile?

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:03.833
He's a holy man. That's his religious title.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.254
Joe is the Jewel.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:19.932
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
Why'd you keep it from me?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:23.144
Because I thought if you knew,
you wouldn't come with us.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.313
Maybe I would've surprised you.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:30.193
I think I've come through once or twice,
if I remember right.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.987
I'm sorry.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.990
You're right. You come through all the time.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.665
It's funny.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.211
I really thought we had a chance.

01:16:04.267 --> 01:16:06.269
Look! The train to Kadir!

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:09.564
<i>Come on, Jack.
Inshallah, we'll be there tonight.</i>

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:13.819
- What a lot of people!
- They are going to see the false redeemer.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:17.239
- Omar again, huh?
- We'll see about that.

01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:55.276
Shit!

01:18:05.178 --> 01:18:07.263
What are you doing?

01:18:07.722 --> 01:18:10.016
Come on!

01:18:10.266 --> 01:18:11.935
Jump!

01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:17.023
No!

01:18:47.886 --> 01:18:49.972
No! Hang on, Joan!

01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:10.450
Jack, watch out!

01:19:10.533 --> 01:19:12.535
It's...

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:44.776
Guys, wait up! Come on, Humphrey.
Go, go, go!

01:19:54.202 --> 01:19:56.411
Do something!

01:19:56.495 --> 01:19:58.580
What do you want me to do?

01:21:31.337 --> 01:21:33.048
Colton!

01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:38.012
Your ass is grass,
and I'm a lawn mower, Colton!

01:21:38.095 --> 01:21:40.931
Colton, I'll get you! Colton, I'm on to ya!

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.049
Colton.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.605
All right, yeah!

01:23:16.066 --> 01:23:19.319
All right! Let's go, come on.
Let's get out of here!

01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:28.244
Just-Joan, you're gre...

01:23:30.079 --> 01:23:31.956
Welcome.

01:23:32.039 --> 01:23:37.170
I don't usually travel by train,
but I had a small accident with my helicopter.

01:23:50.475 --> 01:23:52.769
May we reach Kadir in time.

01:24:15.624 --> 01:24:19.669
Once we get inside,
we must find the entrance to the catacombs.

01:24:20.545 --> 01:24:22.632
T-shirts! Buy T-shirts!

01:24:22.715 --> 01:24:27.178
Gimme the T-shirt.
I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Get outta here, will ya?

01:24:47.447 --> 01:24:51.326
You know, I really admire
your loyalty to each other.

01:24:52.035 --> 01:24:55.956
And I'm going to give you a chance
to be together to the very end.

01:24:56.039 --> 01:24:57.916
Well, not exactly.

01:24:57.999 --> 01:25:01.127
One will watch the other die.

01:25:06.258 --> 01:25:08.343
But which one?

01:25:10.011 --> 01:25:12.097
Rachid.

01:25:13.807 --> 01:25:17.060
- Is that the goat's blood?
- Yes.

01:25:17.144 --> 01:25:21.231
Very popular
with the inhabitants of these catacombs.

01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:25.943
- Rats.
- Yes. They eat until they get the last drop.

01:25:26.318 --> 01:25:29.363
But don't worry, Mr Colton.
You won't be alone.

01:25:30.156 --> 01:25:35.286
Rachid is now placing acid
that will eat through Miss Wilder's rope.

01:25:35.369 --> 01:25:38.289
What kind of sick pervert
would go to this trouble?

01:25:38.748 --> 01:25:40.750
- Why don't you shoot us?!
- Jack!

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:44.754
What kind of demented psychopath
would even think of this?

01:25:44.962 --> 01:25:47.465
<i>- The Savage Secret.
- What?</i>

01:25:48.632 --> 01:25:50.509
Was my biggest seller.

01:25:54.764 --> 01:25:59.393
Think about this pit
as your last adventure, Joan Wilder.

01:26:00.853 --> 01:26:03.147
My people await me.

01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:26.878
What you talkin' about?
I work with professional people.

01:26:26.961 --> 01:26:30.966
You tell His Highness
the show starts with him or without him.

01:26:38.681 --> 01:26:42.852
Goddamn beanie convention.
Wind up goin' home with a rug.

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:45.021
The entrance!

01:26:56.156 --> 01:26:58.450
Give me a red to the yellow. And cue!

01:27:00.327 --> 01:27:02.871
I said give me a red gel down there!

01:27:08.752 --> 01:27:11.797
And cue! For Gawd's sake, cue!

01:27:36.405 --> 01:27:39.408
Build it, build it softly.
And give me some smoke.

01:28:09.771 --> 01:28:14.192
That's good, that's good, that's very good.
Now, bring it up slowly.

01:29:31.393 --> 01:29:33.854
There are many rooms and many ways.

01:29:33.937 --> 01:29:36.148
You! You go this way.

01:29:36.231 --> 01:29:38.525
And, you! You go this way.

01:29:38.608 --> 01:29:41.068
And we: We go this way.

01:30:02.132 --> 01:30:04.216
Boy, it stinks in this place.

01:30:08.554 --> 01:30:11.182
What looks good, amigo?

01:30:11.265 --> 01:30:15.144
You go from this way. And... I go this way.

01:30:15.227 --> 01:30:17.313
All right.

01:30:18.314 --> 01:30:20.191
What a fruit loop.

01:30:21.734 --> 01:30:23.819
- How'd they get out?
- What?

01:30:23.903 --> 01:30:26.863
<i>In The Savage Secret, how'd they get out?</i>

01:30:28.698 --> 01:30:31.576
Jesse had a knife hidden in his boot.

01:30:32.869 --> 01:30:35.872
You wouldn't happen to have a knife,
would ya?

01:30:35.955 --> 01:30:39.000
- I'm not even wearing underwear.
- Great!

01:30:40.126 --> 01:30:42.212
No!

01:31:01.439 --> 01:31:04.150
We were good together,
weren't we, Joan Wilder?

01:31:04.234 --> 01:31:06.403
The best.

01:31:06.486 --> 01:31:09.406
- And we're gonna make it.
- Yeah.

01:31:12.742 --> 01:31:15.160
Oh, God. I love you, lady.

01:31:15.244 --> 01:31:17.162
I love you, Jack.

01:31:17.496 --> 01:31:19.581
Will you marry me?

01:31:20.874 --> 01:31:24.169
- Yes!
- Because I never want you leaving me again.

01:31:24.878 --> 01:31:28.883
You're not just saying that
because this is it, are you?

01:31:30.593 --> 01:31:34.639
I'm saying it
because I'm not afraid to say it any more.

01:31:48.902 --> 01:31:52.197
So where do you wanna go
on our honeymoon?

01:32:13.677 --> 01:32:17.848
Rats! Get out of here, you...
Goddamn rat farm! Go on!

01:32:18.223 --> 01:32:23.936
- Ralph! Get us out of here, will ya?
- Ah! And there's the biggest rat of all.

01:32:24.854 --> 01:32:26.939
Colton, look at you. You...

01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:30.526
You don't know how many nights
I dreamed of this.

01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:36.032
- Except your flesh was torn off your body.
- Ralph, please, just help us down.

01:32:36.115 --> 01:32:38.201
Jack! Hold on!

01:32:39.494 --> 01:32:42.246
Well, well, well, Colton.

01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:46.792
I think this calls for a renegotiation.
Don't you, Tarzan? Huh?

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:50.128
This looks a little bit more like 70-30.

01:32:50.212 --> 01:32:54.717
- Or maybe even 80-20.
- Ralph, will ya get the rats off that rope?!

01:32:55.343 --> 01:32:59.639
- I don't go near rats, buddy.
- Ralph, do not be afraid.

01:33:01.099 --> 01:33:03.810
Remember the Sufi way: See with your heart.

01:33:04.435 --> 01:33:08.231
My heart sees rats, Pop.
Don't let this garb fool you.

01:33:08.314 --> 01:33:10.565
Come on, Colton. Where's the Jewel?

01:33:10.649 --> 01:33:14.986
Ralph, I am the Jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.

01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:18.198
And I'm a kumquat from Queens.
Pipe down, towel-head!

01:33:18.281 --> 01:33:21.451
- Come on, Ralph.
- Take the ladder and put it over the well.

01:33:21.535 --> 01:33:25.205
- Please, don't let us die!
- That's a good idea, Legs.

01:33:25.288 --> 01:33:30.710
I ain't gonna let you die, but I ain't movin' no
ladder until you come across with the rock!

01:33:44.474 --> 01:33:47.018
Lookin' more like 90-10! Huh, kumquat?

01:33:48.895 --> 01:33:52.733
- Did you get the ladder all right?
- Jack, help me unlock the Jewel.

01:33:52.816 --> 01:33:57.528
The Jewel? You mean you weren't
shittin' me? That guy really is the Jewel?

01:33:57.611 --> 01:34:00.740
Come on.
We still got time to stop Omar. Let's go.

01:34:01.866 --> 01:34:04.827
Ralph, that is not the Sufi way.

01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:10.124
I don't know what got into me, Jewels. Every
time I'm around this guy he makes me crazy.

01:34:10.207 --> 01:34:14.420
Come on. Tell him to cut me down, Jewels.
Come on, huh?

01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:03.302
Don't fuck around with the equipment!
Bloody woman!

01:35:27.409 --> 01:35:29.494
Here they come, Jack.

01:35:51.224 --> 01:35:56.395
Oh, my God. Look at this. Looks like
Our Lady of Mount Palmer schoolyard.

01:35:57.896 --> 01:35:59.815
Hold it!

01:36:04.111 --> 01:36:06.822
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

01:36:08.449 --> 01:36:10.117
Oh, Rachid.

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.246
How ya doin'? Let's talk this over
before you butcher me alive.

01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:16.832
What are you getting so steamed about?

01:36:19.625 --> 01:36:22.170
Look at that. It worked!

01:38:02.519 --> 01:38:04.688
Get over the wall. Come on!

01:38:05.063 --> 01:38:07.149
Get goin'.

01:38:12.112 --> 01:38:14.197
Keep going.

01:38:39.972 --> 01:38:43.434
I knew we'd hook up again, Colton. Get it?

01:38:46.187 --> 01:38:48.314
I swear to God!

01:38:48.397 --> 01:38:50.483
My right hand to God!

01:38:50.566 --> 01:38:52.651
Come on!

01:39:33.566 --> 01:39:38.780
I am dead, Miss Wilder.
All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.

01:39:39.155 --> 01:39:41.241
But I will not be alone.

01:39:50.916 --> 01:39:53.460
Who is going to save you now?

01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:57.590
Who?

01:40:38.714 --> 01:40:40.799
Well, you got your story.

01:40:41.759 --> 01:40:43.844
I got a lot more than that.

01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:09.744
You are married!

01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:42.360
Always a bridesmaid, never the bride.

01:41:42.443 --> 01:41:44.945
As usual, it's zilch for poor Ralphie.

01:41:47.864 --> 01:41:49.950
You are Sufi.

01:41:52.035 --> 01:41:54.121
Keep it always.

01:41:55.497 --> 01:41:57.582
Guys!

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.046
Sufis rule!
