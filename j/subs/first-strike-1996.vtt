02:05.552 --> 02:08.919
I've been following her
for the last two weeks.

02:08.955 --> 02:12.083
Four days ago, she signed up
for a tour to Ukraine.

02:12.125 --> 02:16.926
She's working with a contact,
but we don't know who he is.

02:19.232 --> 02:21.860
Her name is "Natasha...

02:21.901 --> 02:24.995
'"Ru-ru...

02:25.038 --> 02:27.404
'"Ru-kruchus..."

02:28.975 --> 02:31.910
OK. Thank you, Jackie.
Well done.

02:31.945 --> 02:33.071
Thank you.

02:33.112 --> 02:35.478
Bill,
I'd like to talk with you.

02:35.515 --> 02:38.507
Me? OK.

02:38.551 --> 02:40.143
Excuse me.

02:40.186 --> 02:42.984
Jackie, the CIA guy
said you did great work.

02:43.022 --> 02:45.252
They were impressed.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.282
They said you have
to work with them again.

02:47.327 --> 02:49.124
When I get a chance.

02:49.162 --> 02:51.630
All right. So you agree.

02:51.664 --> 02:54.189
You will stay on the case.

02:54.234 --> 02:56.668
You mean I have
to follow her to Ukraine?

02:56.703 --> 02:58.796
I promise, this will be easy.

02:58.838 --> 03:01.898
The CIA have so many people.
Why did they choose me?

03:01.941 --> 03:04.501
They think Natasha's contact
may be suspicious...

03:04.544 --> 03:06.011
so they want a new face.

03:06.045 --> 03:08.513
But I don't know
the language or place.

03:08.548 --> 03:11.016
This is all you have to do--
follow her onto the plane...

03:11.050 --> 03:13.018
watch her,
record her movements...

03:13.052 --> 03:15.543
and turn your notes over
when you arrive.

03:15.588 --> 03:18.022
I just watch her on the plane?

03:18.057 --> 03:20.924
That's right.
What can she do on a plane?

03:20.960 --> 03:24.487
-That's all I do?
-That's almost all you do.

03:24.530 --> 03:26.521
But there's one important thing.

03:28.101 --> 03:30.535
Take a few days vacation
out there.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.037
You deserve it.

03:32.071 --> 03:34.539
Let the Ukrainians
take care of things.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.872
Relax and have fun.
That's an order.

03:36.909 --> 03:38.308
Yes, sir.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.835
Remember to buy me some caviar.

04:12.512 --> 04:14.878
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.784
-Welcome to the Ukraine.
-Mark.

04:23.823 --> 04:26.485
This is Commander Korda,
Department of Security.

04:26.526 --> 04:29.518
-Nice to meet you.
-Did you find anything?

04:29.562 --> 04:32.030
No. But she went
to the toilet seven times.

04:32.065 --> 04:36.001
There's the timetable.
She didn't talk to anyone.

04:36.035 --> 04:39.835
Thanks, Jackie. You're done.
We'll take over from here.

04:39.872 --> 04:42.033
Very good.

04:42.075 --> 04:44.009
One thousand dollars.

04:44.043 --> 04:47.069
-Any other currency?
-No.

04:50.650 --> 04:54.518
Your accommodation is fixed.
Your flight is tomorrow.

04:54.554 --> 04:57.284
Here's some pocket money.
One billion.

04:57.323 --> 04:58.517
One billion?

04:58.558 --> 05:00.549
A telephone.
Dial 0-1 if you need us.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.051
-Simple, huh?
-Pretty simple.

05:03.096 --> 05:05.656
Marina will show you
to your car.

05:05.698 --> 05:06.824
Oh, yes.

05:06.866 --> 05:08.697
Have fun.

05:11.771 --> 05:13.261
It's line two.

05:23.082 --> 05:25.050
Hello. It's Natasha.

05:25.084 --> 05:26.312
It's a tap.

05:26.352 --> 05:29.048
Sorry. Wrong number.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.395
-They're onto us. Let's go.
-Call the strike force.

05:37.430 --> 05:42.129
Natasha Rushinski,
please come to lnformation.

05:44.237 --> 05:47.673
-Thank you.
-Have a good holiday.

05:52.545 --> 05:56.675
Natasha Rushinski, come with us.
Take her away.

05:56.716 --> 06:00.584
-She's with my tour.
-It's not your business.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.053
I'm with
the Department of Security.

06:02.088 --> 06:04.955
I have orders.
Talk to my commander.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.151
Bastard!

06:07.493 --> 06:09.961
-They've taken the girl.
-What?

06:09.996 --> 06:12.430
-She's gone.
-Who is his commander?

06:12.465 --> 06:15.434
-Natasha was taken away.
-When?

06:15.468 --> 06:20.337
-Two for five million?
-This is the best there is.

06:30.883 --> 06:32.145
Thank you.

06:32.185 --> 06:34.881
Follow the car! Quick!

06:42.695 --> 06:46.062
Slow down! The road is closed.
Go that way.

06:56.742 --> 06:59.404
Natasha. Thank God.

07:05.918 --> 07:08.284
I go and look. You wait.

07:42.388 --> 07:46.017
Wait in here, please.
You will be warmer.

07:53.366 --> 07:55.561
Mark, I saw Natasha.
What happened?

07:55.601 --> 07:58.900
-Where?
-She went into a church.

07:58.938 --> 08:02.032
Keep following her.
Don't let them see you.

08:02.074 --> 08:03.598
Try and get a street name
and call us.

08:03.643 --> 08:05.133
I'll try.

08:22.161 --> 08:23.560
Major Majenko!

08:23.596 --> 08:25.086
Tsui!

08:25.131 --> 08:27.099
Your strike force saved Natasha.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.124
Thank you for sending them in.

08:29.168 --> 08:31.398
Your problem is my problem.

08:31.437 --> 08:33.769
Yes. And I got your stuff here.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.000
Excellent.

08:36.876 --> 08:40.607
The arrangements have been made
just as we discussed.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.514
This is for your expenses,
and this is your new passport...

08:44.550 --> 08:46.017
with an American visa.

08:46.052 --> 08:49.146
Your money is already
in your Swiss bank account.

08:49.188 --> 08:50.655
Very good.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.557
Take the shell apart and
send them to these addresses.

08:53.593 --> 08:57.029
I'll take the guidance system
and the uranium core with me.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.340
I've got our insurance.
Let's go.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.729
I'll call you.
Make sure the money is there.

09:32.765 --> 09:34.027
Please be careful.

09:34.066 --> 09:37.229
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

09:37.269 --> 09:39.032
I'll see you later.

09:39.071 --> 09:41.369
I'll wait for you there.

10:11.037 --> 10:13.471
It's me. I found a new suspect.

10:13.506 --> 10:14.871
Who is he?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.272
I don't know.

10:16.308 --> 10:17.673
Where are you?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.177
Let me see.

10:25.985 --> 10:27.350
I can't read the sign.

10:27.386 --> 10:29.684
Can you spell it out?

10:29.722 --> 10:32.282
'"C-h-i-k--" No.

10:32.324 --> 10:34.121
Left-right "K."

10:34.160 --> 10:35.787
Left and right "K."

10:35.828 --> 10:37.955
H-i-k...

10:37.997 --> 10:39.362
'"P-a-t-n."

10:39.398 --> 10:41.389
Reverse "N."

10:41.434 --> 10:43.197
We got it!

10:43.235 --> 10:44.600
We're on our way.

10:46.672 --> 10:48.663
Package for Alexander Nevsky.

10:51.444 --> 10:52.604
Thanks.

11:08.027 --> 11:10.791
Are you going
on the slopes today?

11:10.830 --> 11:13.162
Can I help you?

11:13.199 --> 11:15.759
-Skis, snowboard?
-Snowboard.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.098
-First-timer?
-Yes.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.001
This way, please.

11:29.548 --> 11:31.106
Thank you.

11:33.018 --> 11:36.078
Hello?
I want to rent one of these.

11:36.122 --> 11:40.456
Hello? Natasha.
Is the money deposited?

11:40.493 --> 11:42.552
No. It's a wire transfer.
The check didn't clear.

11:42.595 --> 11:44.460
It takes three days to process.

11:44.497 --> 11:48.228
I'll call you again.

11:51.203 --> 11:53.569
Department of Security.
Come with us.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.274
Hey, mister. Buy a hat, please.

11:57.309 --> 11:59.277
Here. I'll take it.

11:59.311 --> 12:01.973
-Please buy our hats.
-How much?

12:02.014 --> 12:04.676
-Forty.
-Keep the change.

12:04.717 --> 12:06.514
Thank you.

12:15.394 --> 12:18.158
Where can I get some clothes?

12:28.107 --> 12:29.267
Thank you.

12:57.536 --> 12:59.663
Jackie, where are you?

12:59.705 --> 13:02.503
Suspect just went through
the security area.

13:02.541 --> 13:04.338
He's in some security area.

13:04.376 --> 13:06.173
Tell him to keep going.

13:06.212 --> 13:08.203
Keep moving. Go ahead.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.181
No! There's a picture.

13:10.216 --> 13:12.616
If I go through,
I'll get shot.

13:12.651 --> 13:14.516
But the sign says he'll be shot.

13:14.553 --> 13:16.521
It's just for kids.

13:16.555 --> 13:18.648
It's just for kids. Go ahead.

13:54.593 --> 13:56.788
Get the men together!
Prepare to move out.

14:14.513 --> 14:15.844
Welcome, my friend.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.142
-We've been waiting for you.
-That's good.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.659
Where the hell are you?

14:30.696 --> 14:34.792
About two miles...upside...

14:34.833 --> 14:37.199
west of restricted area sign.

14:37.236 --> 14:40.330
Two miles west of
the restricted area sign.

14:40.372 --> 14:42.033
Hurry up. I'm freezing.

14:42.074 --> 14:43.371
Put on more clothes.

14:43.409 --> 14:46.037
OK. Clothes.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.480
My boss is waiting.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.678
There's someone out in area "B."

15:27.720 --> 15:29.483
Who is it?

15:29.521 --> 15:31.216
Maybe Chinese.

15:31.256 --> 15:34.089
-Who did you bring with you?
-Nobody.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.380
They're inside.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.542
-See anyone else?
-I didn't see anybody around.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.747
Stay back.
We will handle the arrest.

16:01.787 --> 16:04.881
Let's go. Move in!

16:08.293 --> 16:11.228
It's bloody freezing here!

16:15.968 --> 16:18.960
Nice hat. Aren't you cold?

16:19.004 --> 16:20.972
What do you think?

16:26.779 --> 16:30.180
All units stand by.
The enemy has arrived.

16:31.183 --> 16:32.582
Give me the briefcase.

16:36.989 --> 16:39.890
Don't move! Back off!

16:41.960 --> 16:44.690
Tell your people
not to open fire.

16:44.730 --> 16:48.029
I have a detonator
wired to the uranium core.

16:51.937 --> 16:54.064
Freeze! Don't move!

17:09.054 --> 17:11.488
Hey! It's a trap!

17:44.356 --> 17:45.880
Don't shoot!

17:45.924 --> 17:48.324
Grab the case! Get it!

17:49.461 --> 17:52.487
Jackie, go!
Get the snowmobile!

18:11.884 --> 18:15.183
Tsui! What are you doing here?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.380
Get the chopper off the ground!

18:24.563 --> 18:26.588
Jackie, over here!

18:29.635 --> 18:31.933
Shoot him ! Shoot him !

18:42.548 --> 18:44.345
Let's go!

18:44.383 --> 18:46.078
Go! Move!

19:04.937 --> 19:06.165
Go on! Go!

19:07.172 --> 19:08.332
Move!

19:43.709 --> 19:44.869
Don't move!

21:42.160 --> 21:44.025
Little more!

21:44.062 --> 21:45.222
Give me your hand! Come on!

22:51.663 --> 22:54.860
There! Over there!
Get the case!

23:52.257 --> 23:53.884
Hello, Jackie.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.058
Who are you?

23:57.095 --> 24:00.587
I'm Colonel Gregor Yegorov
of the Federal Security Bureau.

24:00.632 --> 24:01.758
Huh?

24:01.800 --> 24:05.600
FSB for short.
The new, improved KGB.

24:05.637 --> 24:08.663
KGB? Am I in Russia?

24:08.707 --> 24:13.007
Yes. We're connected to the
Ukraine Department of Security.

24:13.044 --> 24:15.376
I know about your operation
with the CIA.

24:15.413 --> 24:19.076
The FSB generals
want to see you.

24:19.117 --> 24:21.881
You are coming to Moscow
with me today.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.684
-Can you help me?
-Yes.

24:24.723 --> 24:27.624
Turn off all those things.

24:27.659 --> 24:28.990
I'm very hot.

24:44.042 --> 24:48.843
Welcome. We need your help
to find the arms dealer...

24:48.880 --> 24:52.680
who smuggled out a nuclear
warhead a few days ago.

24:52.717 --> 24:56.710
His name is Tsui.
He was recruited by the CIA...

24:56.755 --> 24:59.019
to steal uranium
production strategies...

24:59.057 --> 25:00.957
from the Russian government.

25:00.992 --> 25:04.450
He has been under investigation
for years.

25:04.496 --> 25:08.432
We believe he has a sister
living in Australia.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.458
Her name is Annie.
We want you to find her.

25:11.503 --> 25:16.770
This mission is very important
to our national security.

25:18.176 --> 25:20.770
I'll have to call
my superior in Hong Kong.

25:20.812 --> 25:25.977
We did. They have agreed
to attach you to our mission.

25:42.634 --> 25:45.000
We're not flying to Australia
in this, are we?

25:45.036 --> 25:47.027
Part of the way.

25:50.742 --> 25:52.937
Where are we going now?

25:52.978 --> 25:54.775
We're going down.

25:56.982 --> 25:59.883
-To the submarine?
-Yes.

26:01.319 --> 26:02.752
Colonel.

26:02.787 --> 26:04.755
We're heading to Australia now.

26:04.789 --> 26:08.247
There will be a fisherman's boat
taking us in.

26:08.293 --> 26:10.955
Everything is already
arranged for you.

26:10.996 --> 26:12.964
Are we being smuggled in?

26:12.998 --> 26:17.196
No. I wouldn't use that term.
The boat will pick us up.

26:17.969 --> 26:21.302
Uncle Bill! I'm in Australia
having a great time!

26:21.339 --> 26:24.365
I'm talking to you
while enjoying my great view!

26:24.409 --> 26:26.707
Wow! Working
for the FSB is great.

26:26.745 --> 26:29.680
I have a presidential suite
with two levels.

26:29.714 --> 26:33.775
Eight thousand square feet,
with pool, sauna, and Jacuzzi.

26:33.818 --> 26:36.844
Wait. Hold on a second.
My koala bear just came out.

26:36.888 --> 26:39.550
What? ln your hotel room?

26:39.591 --> 26:41.855
It's only
a stuffed toy, right?

26:41.893 --> 26:45.556
No! It's the real thing.
Say hello to Uncle Bill.

26:46.831 --> 26:49.265
He's too shy.
Don't hang up. Hold on.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.530
You have to wait.
I have to carry it back.

26:52.604 --> 26:56.005
Good boy. Good boy.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.201
Yes?

26:57.242 --> 26:59.574
Excuse me, sir.
Your tea is ready.

26:59.611 --> 27:01.078
Thank you very much.

27:01.112 --> 27:03.342
He's living it up.
I should have gone with him.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.440
There you go.

27:05.483 --> 27:07.451
That's OK now.

27:07.485 --> 27:09.953
Really, I'm not making this up.

27:09.988 --> 27:14.288
What else?
A great car, money.

27:14.325 --> 27:17.954
Lots of designer clothing--
all given to me.

27:17.996 --> 27:21.898
I feel almost like James Bond,
except no gorgeous girls.

27:21.933 --> 27:26.700
If all this is for real,
you should be careful.

27:26.738 --> 27:29.502
OK. So long. Bye-bye.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.643
Think he went crazy?
Maybe he's overworked.

27:34.679 --> 27:37.011
Wow. Look at these briefs.

27:39.617 --> 27:43.018
Boy, you must be popular.

27:43.054 --> 27:45.022
Own line of underwear.
Who'd wear those?

27:59.604 --> 28:01.936
-One adult?
-Yes.

28:01.973 --> 28:03.099
Fifteen-fifty, please.

28:03.141 --> 28:05.268
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Annie Tsui.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.403
Annie?
She's in a show right now.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.224
Your brother and I
are sworn brothers.

28:25.263 --> 28:26.525
He came back?

28:26.564 --> 28:28.623
He did?
Actually, I don't know.

28:28.666 --> 28:33.069
He told me you are working here.
I'm here on vacation.

28:33.104 --> 28:37.131
Sorry I have to leave so soon.
My dad's been hospitalized.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.665
-Thanks.
-No problem.

28:41.412 --> 28:42.970
Your job must be dangerous.

28:43.014 --> 28:44.845
No, not really.

28:44.883 --> 28:47.977
Sharks will only go crazy
when they smell blood.

28:48.019 --> 28:50.510
They see anything that moves,
that's when they bite.

28:50.555 --> 28:53.490
As long as you don't move,
nothing will happen to you.

28:53.525 --> 28:56.517
Now I know.
If I ever see a shark...

28:56.561 --> 28:58.995
I'll pretend to be a rock
and not move.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.931
I have to get to the hospital
to see Dad.

29:01.966 --> 29:04.298
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going.

29:04.335 --> 29:06.826
Thanks for the flowers.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.930
Cari Ann? Put that on my tab.

29:08.973 --> 29:10.964
-No problem.
-Thank you.

29:11.009 --> 29:12.169
Bye-bye.

29:16.915 --> 29:19.941
I have never met Mr. Tsui.
Can I go to hospital with you?

29:19.984 --> 29:22.976
All right. Why don't you
wait at the front gate?

29:23.021 --> 29:26.081
-I'll be right there.
-OK.

29:27.492 --> 29:29.960
Hi, Gregor. I met his sister.

29:29.994 --> 29:31.985
I'm going to hospital with her.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.555
Very good. I'll meet you there.

29:37.669 --> 29:39.136
Excuse me, please.

29:39.170 --> 29:41.138
There's a box for you here.

29:41.172 --> 29:44.801
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll pick it up later.

29:44.843 --> 29:46.970
-OK. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

29:48.613 --> 29:50.979
-Hey, Allen.
-Hi.

29:51.015 --> 29:54.212
Hi, Daddy.
Are you better today?

29:54.252 --> 29:57.813
Dad, I want you to meet
Tsui's sworn brother.

29:57.856 --> 30:00.416
Never heard him mention you.
I'm Allen. And your name is?

30:00.458 --> 30:01.618
I'm Jackie.

30:01.659 --> 30:04.958
-Box receiving?
-All operating.

30:04.996 --> 30:08.488
Are you feeling better?
What did the doctor say?

30:08.533 --> 30:10.728
I'm fine, good girl.

30:12.203 --> 30:15.934
Why has my eldest son
never spoken of you?

30:15.974 --> 30:19.239
I'm not his sworn brother.
I'm with Hong Kong police.

30:19.277 --> 30:23.008
I'm investigating your son
stealing nuclear weapon.

30:23.047 --> 30:25.481
Can I talk to you privately?

30:36.461 --> 30:39.897
-What did he say?
-He's a policeman.

30:39.931 --> 30:42.866
Tell me why
you are looking for my son.

30:42.901 --> 30:45.301
Do you know what
your son does for a living?

30:45.336 --> 30:48.032
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

30:48.072 --> 30:51.235
Even when I'm dying,
he does not come to see me.

30:51.276 --> 30:54.803
The Tsui family
no longer has this son.

30:58.583 --> 31:00.050
Thank you.

31:00.084 --> 31:02.484
I hope you get better soon.

31:17.035 --> 31:19.060
I didn't mean to lie to you.

31:26.844 --> 31:29.574
I hope that hurt.
You lied to me.

31:29.614 --> 31:31.104
Why couldn't you lie to my dad?

31:31.149 --> 31:34.277
My father loves
his eldest son most.

31:34.319 --> 31:36.753
Just let him die peacefully.
Get away from me.

31:36.788 --> 31:40.053
If I had any news,
I would never let you know.

31:40.091 --> 31:41.524
Please leave us now.

31:41.559 --> 31:44.119
Please be quiet
or leave the hospital.

31:44.162 --> 31:47.131
Go. Please.

31:55.139 --> 31:56.731
Brother.

32:00.078 --> 32:04.606
Where have you been?
Why are you dressed like that?

32:04.649 --> 32:07.675
Look at yourself in that outfit.
You know Dad's having surgery?

32:07.719 --> 32:10.813
Yes, I know.
I already spoke to him.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.121
Come in.

32:17.895 --> 32:20.489
That man out there works
for the new Russian mafia.

32:20.531 --> 32:23.989
He's not a policeman.
You must never believe this man.

32:24.035 --> 32:26.003
Uncle Seven is going
to surgery this afternoon.

32:26.037 --> 32:29.666
-What about Tsui?
-He said he hasn't seen him.

32:29.707 --> 32:32.505
I sent you something
yesterday by messenger.

32:32.543 --> 32:34.010
Did you get it?

32:34.045 --> 32:36.513
I got it this morning.

32:36.547 --> 32:41.678
You have to hide it in
the safest place you can find.

32:41.719 --> 32:43.186
Understand?

32:43.221 --> 32:45.553
What if Uncle Seven dies
and the good son doesn't show?

32:45.590 --> 32:47.820
If he dies,
he'll show up for sure.

32:47.859 --> 32:48.985
Why are you so sure?

32:49.027 --> 32:51.518
He's the eldest son
in the family.

32:51.562 --> 32:54.190
He has to...

32:54.232 --> 32:57.668
carry a flat bag of water.

32:57.702 --> 32:59.636
What is all this?

32:59.670 --> 33:01.968
That's a Chinese tradition.

33:02.006 --> 33:03.906
Someone may be
following you already.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.171
Always be careful.

33:08.246 --> 33:10.111
I'm sorry.

33:10.148 --> 33:14.312
Take this. You might need it
when you follow the girl.

33:16.054 --> 33:17.954
Wow. Now I'm 007.

33:18.489 --> 33:22.152
-Hi. Can I pick up my package?
-Sure.

33:22.193 --> 33:24.855
Underwater World
is now closing.

33:24.896 --> 33:27.262
-Here you go.
-Thanks. Bye.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.766
We hope
you've enjoyed your day.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.029
Thank you.

33:34.539 --> 33:36.029
Thank you.

33:50.688 --> 33:52.280
-I thought you'd gone already.
-Not yet.

33:52.323 --> 33:54.348
-OK. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

35:47.538 --> 35:49.472
You scared me.

35:53.044 --> 35:55.205
Bye-bye.

35:57.748 --> 35:58.908
Bye-bye.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.685
Good jump.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.674
I will follow you...

36:31.716 --> 36:35.345
Follow you wherever you may...

36:35.386 --> 36:36.580
Keep singing.

36:36.621 --> 36:40.557
There isn't an ocean too deep...

36:40.591 --> 36:41.888
You, out.

36:43.094 --> 36:44.288
A mountain so high...

36:44.328 --> 36:47.024
I think
he's following the girl.

36:49.367 --> 36:51.995
I must follow you...

36:52.036 --> 36:56.370
Ever since
you touched my hand, I knew...

36:56.407 --> 36:59.035
That near you
I always must be...

37:03.481 --> 37:06.780
And nothing
can keep you from me...

37:06.817 --> 37:09.081
You are my destiny...

37:23.000 --> 37:25.628
I love you, I love you...

37:25.670 --> 37:28.571
And where you go,
I follow, I follow...

37:28.606 --> 37:30.005
I follow...

37:33.678 --> 37:35.976
You'll always be my true love,
my true love...

37:36.013 --> 37:37.810
For now until forever...

37:37.848 --> 37:39.645
Forever, forever...

37:39.684 --> 37:43.450
I will follow you...

37:43.487 --> 37:45.478
What's going on?

37:45.523 --> 37:46.990
We've lost the feed.

37:47.024 --> 37:49.652
Track down Jackie's car.
Give me the location.

37:49.694 --> 37:51.321
Follow you--

37:52.897 --> 37:54.364
Come on back.

37:54.398 --> 37:57.265
Wherever you may go...

37:57.301 --> 37:59.496
It's all right.
He won't bite you.

37:59.537 --> 38:01.937
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!

38:01.972 --> 38:03.462
What are you doing?

38:17.254 --> 38:18.721
He's at the Underwater World.

38:18.756 --> 38:20.815
Obviously,
something is going wrong there.

38:27.498 --> 38:30.797
-Now we can talk.
-Yes.

38:30.835 --> 38:32.462
I know you're with
the Hong Kong police.

38:32.503 --> 38:34.061
Who are you working with?

38:34.105 --> 38:36.869
Used to be CIA. Now it's FSB.

38:36.907 --> 38:41.173
-A complicated background.
-It was quite simple.

38:41.212 --> 38:43.043
The man you're working for
is Gregor Yegorov.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.479
Do you know him, too?

38:46.450 --> 38:48.179
Call him now. Here.

38:58.028 --> 39:00.496
Hello. Yes.
This is Jackie speaking.

39:00.531 --> 39:02.021
What the hell is going on?

39:03.033 --> 39:04.762
Hello? Jackie?

39:04.802 --> 39:07.100
-It's me.
-Who is this?

39:07.138 --> 39:09.265
It's Tsui.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.433
So you want to get rid
of me without paying?

39:11.475 --> 39:13.943
-Oh, no.
-I want double now.

39:13.978 --> 39:16.469
In cash. You got three days.

39:16.514 --> 39:18.448
I have your phone now.
I'll call you...

39:18.482 --> 39:20.450
and let you know where
and when to meet.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.076
We need to talk about this.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.346
I'm sorry
I had to do that to you...

39:26.390 --> 39:28.051
but look at
what's in your second button.

39:29.727 --> 39:32.958
You'll find them in your car
and everything they gave you...

39:32.997 --> 39:35.830
including this pair
of very ugly underwear.

39:37.435 --> 39:40.962
You're under surveillance
at every moment.

39:41.005 --> 39:44.600
The less you know
the safer you are.

39:47.244 --> 39:50.475
By the way, Jackie...

39:50.514 --> 39:52.880
you're a lousy singer.

39:58.823 --> 40:01.815
Everything is here,
but the jacket is missing.

40:01.859 --> 40:03.520
Here is the wallet.

40:08.899 --> 40:10.491
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.832
-Where is Tsui?
-He's gone.

40:12.870 --> 40:16.169
-What did he tell you?
-What do you think?

40:16.207 --> 40:18.573
Seems like you have
some kind of deal going on.

40:18.609 --> 40:22.511
Don't believe what he said.
He's an expert in mind games.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.275
He's a top CIA agent.

40:24.315 --> 40:28.581
Maybe you're right,
but how do you explain this?

40:30.187 --> 40:32.587
We have to look out for you.
It's part of our job.

40:32.623 --> 40:36.525
You wanted me to find Tsui?
Now he found you.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.190
I will write a full report to
my superior and your superior.

40:41.232 --> 40:44.201
I'm out. That's your clothes.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.725
That's your car.

40:47.571 --> 40:49.061
This my wallet.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.042
Bye.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.567
Bye.

41:00.684 --> 41:03.016
I'm going. Bye-bye.

41:33.050 --> 41:35.018
Now kill him !

41:35.052 --> 41:36.986
Not yet.
Let's have some fun first.

41:49.967 --> 41:51.958
Had enough?

42:56.567 --> 42:58.899
What are you doing
taking so long?

42:58.936 --> 43:00.836
This guy can move like a monkey.

43:58.062 --> 44:01.259
Don't push me...or I jump.

44:04.802 --> 44:06.997
OK. Go ahead.

44:11.508 --> 44:13.499
Come and get me.

44:21.051 --> 44:22.040
Go get him !

44:23.554 --> 44:25.249
You go and get him !

44:39.536 --> 44:41.060
Who is it?

44:42.239 --> 44:44.002
Honey, is that you?

44:44.041 --> 44:45.531
Hello?

44:49.413 --> 44:50.539
Who are you?

44:50.581 --> 44:51.707
Me?

44:51.749 --> 44:53.683
I'm the window cleaner.

44:53.717 --> 44:55.184
Window cleaner?

44:55.219 --> 44:57.585
Cripes!
You've got to be joking!

45:00.991 --> 45:02.458
Who are you?

45:02.493 --> 45:04.961
I'm the dry cleaner.

45:04.995 --> 45:07.088
Dry cleaner?

45:07.131 --> 45:08.530
Anna?

45:30.854 --> 45:32.981
Now they want
to silence me forever.

45:33.023 --> 45:35.617
Hey, hold on a second.

45:35.659 --> 45:37.991
So who wants
to silence you forever?

45:38.028 --> 45:40.997
-Gregor.
-But you are working for him.

45:41.031 --> 45:42.658
Did you call the police?

45:42.699 --> 45:45.224
I don't have a passport.
I come over illegally.

45:45.269 --> 45:46.861
I'll call the Australian police.

45:46.904 --> 45:49.771
You report this tomorrow,
and they'll help you.

45:49.807 --> 45:51.741
Just find some hotel
to spend the night tonight.

45:51.775 --> 45:54.505
A hotel? I don't have money
to pay for this call.

45:54.545 --> 45:56.740
I have to hang up now!

45:56.780 --> 45:58.839
What are your plans
for tonight?

45:58.882 --> 46:00.782
I'll sleep on the street.

46:00.818 --> 46:02.809
We are two hours ahead.

46:46.697 --> 46:48.665
Get out of my bed!

46:48.699 --> 46:50.360
Sorry.

46:53.537 --> 46:55.004
Anyone here?

46:55.038 --> 46:57.029
No. He's on vacation.

47:02.646 --> 47:05.274
-Yes?
-Give me a hand.

47:05.315 --> 47:07.977
-Yes.
-Hit the wall.

47:09.152 --> 47:10.813
Harder.

47:12.489 --> 47:13.979
Good night.

47:15.492 --> 47:16.982
Good night.

47:19.930 --> 47:21.955
I'm sorry, Miss Tsui...

47:21.999 --> 47:24.467
but your father's murderer
is still at large.

47:24.501 --> 47:26.469
Your family may be in danger.

47:26.503 --> 47:29.529
Go back with your brother
and get some rest.

47:29.573 --> 47:32.007
We'll send a uniformed unit
to take you home...

47:32.042 --> 47:33.771
and protect you 24 hours.

47:35.512 --> 47:38.481
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye, miss.

47:38.515 --> 47:40.483
Come, Annie. Let's go home.

47:40.517 --> 47:42.985
We've got a tough one
on our hands, Louis.

47:43.020 --> 47:44.487
Get this videotape analyzed...

47:44.521 --> 47:47.490
see if the suspect
really is the guy on the tape.

47:47.524 --> 47:51.119
Contact Hong Kong police,
get a positive ID on this guy.

48:04.408 --> 48:06.433
There's big trouble
in Brisbane's Chinatown.

48:06.476 --> 48:08.273
The man
who controlled it all...

48:08.312 --> 48:10.439
There you go. Can I help you?

48:10.480 --> 48:12.448
Yes, sir.
Can I have some change, please?

48:12.482 --> 48:13.949
Sure.

48:13.984 --> 48:16.452
Saint Paul Memorial Hospital
last night...

48:16.486 --> 48:19.182
Although unnoticed by staff...

48:19.222 --> 48:21.315
the killer was spotted by
hospital security cameras...

48:21.358 --> 48:23.292
and after looking
at the video...

48:23.327 --> 48:25.488
Sir, here's your money.

48:25.529 --> 48:28.555
Daughter believes the suspect
to be a Hong Kong policeman...

48:28.598 --> 48:31.624
known to her only as Jackie
who visited Uncle Seven.

48:31.668 --> 48:34.501
Police have yet
to pinpoint a motive.

48:34.538 --> 48:37.473
The killer is on the loose
and the subject of a manhunt.

48:37.507 --> 48:38.701
Thank you.

48:38.742 --> 48:40.403
Authorities fear
that the murderer...

48:40.444 --> 48:43.971
That was the murder suspect.
Look!

48:44.014 --> 48:45.879
And now to...

49:39.870 --> 49:42.395
I didn't kill your father.

49:42.439 --> 49:44.634
-Call the cops!
-Please wait.

49:44.674 --> 49:47.234
If I really killed him,
would I come and see you?

49:48.745 --> 49:50.212
Get him !

49:50.247 --> 49:52.647
Please listen to me!
Let me say just one thing!

49:52.682 --> 49:54.775
-You want me to call the police?
-Wait.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.819
Wait. Hear me out.

49:59.856 --> 50:03.383
Can you please tell me
where your brother's hiding?

50:03.427 --> 50:05.122
Why do you want him?

50:05.162 --> 50:07.596
Only your brother can prove
I am not a killer.

50:07.631 --> 50:09.121
It's you!

50:11.735 --> 50:12.997
Let's beat him up first.

51:30.547 --> 51:32.447
Please.
Please listen to me!

53:38.275 --> 53:41.540
-Brother?
-He didn't kill our father.

53:43.580 --> 53:44.911
Come with me.

53:52.989 --> 53:54.320
Let's go downstairs.

53:57.494 --> 53:59.428
Let's go.

54:05.535 --> 54:08.003
I think we know
who the murderer is.

54:08.038 --> 54:10.632
Gregor wants to force you out.

54:10.674 --> 54:13.006
What is the history
between you two?

54:13.043 --> 54:16.012
Three years ago,
I was in the Ukraine...

54:16.046 --> 54:19.538
collecting nuclear intelligence
for the CIA.

54:19.582 --> 54:22.517
The KGB caught me
with my girlfriend Natasha.

54:22.552 --> 54:24.543
They threatened to kill her.

54:30.060 --> 54:32.392
They forced me
to become a double agent.

54:32.429 --> 54:36.593
To save Natasha, I had to agree.

54:36.633 --> 54:38.294
Gregor was with the KGB?

54:39.569 --> 54:42.538
Yes. He's now the head
of the new Russian mafia...

54:42.572 --> 54:45.769
and makes use of his connections
as an FSB officer.

54:45.809 --> 54:48.573
So he wants
to buy a nuclear warhead?

54:49.579 --> 54:51.547
Yes, but not for himself.

54:51.581 --> 54:53.549
He uses the nuclear weapons
to secure oil franchises...

54:53.583 --> 54:55.414
in the Middle Eastern countries.

54:55.452 --> 54:58.148
You should give the warhead
to the police right away.

54:58.188 --> 55:00.986
I can't do that.
Not until I get my money.

55:01.024 --> 55:04.323
How many people
have you killed for money?

55:04.361 --> 55:06.124
Your father died
because you wanted the money.

55:06.162 --> 55:07.993
Do you know
how many nuclear weapons...

55:08.031 --> 55:10.864
have been sold over the world
by military superpowers?

55:10.900 --> 55:13.630
I know that is the truth.
We cannot change it.

55:13.670 --> 55:15.865
You cannot use that
as an excuse.

55:18.208 --> 55:20.802
I'm not as idealistic as you.

55:20.844 --> 55:24.041
I'm not idealistic,
but if we cannot stop them...

55:24.080 --> 55:26.173
we should not encourage them.

55:30.186 --> 55:33.087
Just for money,
you murdered Father.

55:33.123 --> 55:35.717
I will never forgive you
for that.

55:40.196 --> 55:42.664
I'll expose Gregor
for what he is...

55:42.699 --> 55:45.031
and give you evidence
of his crimes...

55:45.068 --> 55:46.660
but I'll need you to help me.

55:46.703 --> 55:47.863
I know.

55:56.713 --> 55:59.682
When I first started
at the CIA...

55:59.716 --> 56:03.117
I had so much ambition,
but since then...

56:03.153 --> 56:06.122
I've done a lot of things
I'm not very proud of.

56:06.156 --> 56:09.057
They wouldn't let me
contact my family.

56:09.092 --> 56:10.650
I lost my identity.

56:12.762 --> 56:15.629
If I hadn't agreed to do
those things for Gregor...

56:15.665 --> 56:17.394
I would have died
three years ago.

56:19.736 --> 56:21.829
Brother.

56:24.140 --> 56:25.607
Let us remember...

56:25.642 --> 56:29.134
that in God's good graces
we will all find shelter...

56:29.179 --> 56:32.046
for His is a mercy without end.

56:37.987 --> 56:39.818
We're at the funeral
of Uncle Seven...

56:39.856 --> 56:41.653
the head of the Golden Dragon
Association...

56:41.691 --> 56:43.659
who was brutally murdered
last week.

56:43.693 --> 56:46.719
There's a strong police presence
here today...

56:46.763 --> 56:49.789
to escort the spirit
of Uncle Seven to Chinatown.

56:52.268 --> 56:54.736
BKO, this is Bravo 8-40.

56:54.771 --> 56:57.171
We're leaving Holy Trinity
with Annie Tsui.

57:03.046 --> 57:06.243
Help! Help! No!

57:06.282 --> 57:09.080
Careful. Lots of police here.

57:33.176 --> 57:36.577
I'm here at Wickham Square.
Where are you?

58:19.756 --> 58:22.657
No! Let go!

58:25.595 --> 58:28.462
You even share the same
coffin with your father.

58:28.498 --> 58:32.025
The coffin is for you.
You killed my father.

58:32.068 --> 58:34.036
He had to die somehow.

58:34.070 --> 58:36.163
At least he died for a reason.

58:45.715 --> 58:48.479
If you move one more step,
I'll blow your head off.

58:51.054 --> 58:52.214
Open!

58:59.495 --> 59:01.292
Damn! I can't see a thing.

59:01.331 --> 59:03.390
I need backup. Hurry!

59:03.433 --> 59:04.559
Now what?

59:04.601 --> 59:06.466
Killing me won't bring him back.

59:06.502 --> 59:09.960
Give me the bomb,
and I'll give you the money.

59:10.006 --> 59:12.270
And then you'll
never see me again.

59:12.308 --> 59:15.800
You think your money can pay
for my father's life?

59:15.845 --> 59:19.838
No. I guess not,
but I got your sister.

59:20.850 --> 59:22.044
Look.

59:24.554 --> 59:28.718
She's young, sexy,
and beautiful.

59:28.758 --> 59:30.385
You don't want her to die.

59:30.426 --> 59:32.223
You bastard!

59:34.764 --> 59:36.595
Move again, I'll break your arm.

59:40.837 --> 59:42.361
Hurry! Give me your hand!

59:54.083 --> 59:57.018
If you don't give me the bomb,
I'll kill both of you right now.

59:57.053 --> 59:58.384
I know you've got it here.

59:58.421 --> 01:00:00.912
You have to let her go first.

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:02.254
Brother!

01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.794
Annie, get out of here.
Hurry up.

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:14.735
Give my stuff to the police.

01:00:15.938 --> 01:00:17.098
Put him in the coffin.

01:00:57.246 --> 01:00:59.339
Come on! Move!

01:01:08.424 --> 01:01:09.823
Go! Quick!

01:01:37.019 --> 01:01:38.646
Can I help you?

01:01:38.688 --> 01:01:41.521
Yes. Thank you.

01:01:54.437 --> 01:01:57.304
Yes! Get out!

01:02:15.491 --> 01:02:17.391
Give me your hands!

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.741
Help me, Jackie!

01:02:42.785 --> 01:02:46.551
Don't move! Hang in there!
I'm on my way!

01:02:53.696 --> 01:02:55.459
Excuse me.

01:02:55.498 --> 01:02:58.899
Help me! Help!

01:02:58.935 --> 01:03:00.835
Please stop this thing!

01:03:06.142 --> 01:03:08.975
-Please, help me.
-Here you go, miss.

01:03:09.011 --> 01:03:10.979
-You OK?
-Yes.

01:03:11.013 --> 01:03:12.503
How did you get on top
of the elevator?

01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:15.116
Thank you very much.

01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:16.618
Hang on a minute.

01:03:16.652 --> 01:03:19.120
We got to write a report
and call the police.

01:03:19.155 --> 01:03:22.181
Central security,
we're on the top floor.

01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:24.955
The girl's OK.
Would you call the police?

01:03:24.994 --> 01:03:27.622
Mick and me are coming down
to fill out a report.

01:03:27.663 --> 01:03:30.063
You look very familiar.
I've seen you before.

01:03:32.335 --> 01:03:33.768
Don't move!

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.538
He hasn't got a gun.

01:03:45.481 --> 01:03:47.346
-Oh, lady!
-I'm sorry.

01:03:47.383 --> 01:03:48.873
Just go!

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.514
Follow me.

01:03:55.825 --> 01:03:57.656
We're live at Wickham Square...

01:03:57.693 --> 01:03:59.558
where the funeral
of Uncle Seven...

01:03:59.595 --> 01:04:01.790
has turned into the biggest
gang war in Chinatown.

01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:05.858
A group of alleged members
of the new Russian mafia...

01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:09.133
gunned down the ceremony
with a rocket-propelled grenade.

01:04:09.171 --> 01:04:11.435
Police say
the murder suspect, Jackie...

01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:15.433
was last seen escaping
with Uncle Seven's daughter.

01:04:15.478 --> 01:04:19.312
Investigations continue
as more bloodshed is expected.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.015
Inspector, results of
the tape have come back.

01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:27.113
That's not Jackie.
Looks like a setup.

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:28.350
Right.

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:34.628
Come on.

01:04:34.664 --> 01:04:35.824
In here.

01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:47.135
I must make
a long-distance call.

01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:49.770
Call upstairs in the office.

01:04:49.812 --> 01:04:51.245
Where is everybody?

01:04:52.748 --> 01:04:54.306
They're on their way.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.250
They're in the office.
Go and get them.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.614
Hey. Wait for my orders
on every move.

01:05:00.656 --> 01:05:02.021
Yes, sir.

01:05:03.492 --> 01:05:05.824
-Uncle Bill, it's Jackie!
-What's happening?

01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:07.988
I'm with younger sister.
We were caught.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.021
Please tell me what to do.

01:05:10.066 --> 01:05:11.499
Just listen to me.

01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:14.503
I briefed the head
of the FSB on your situation.

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:16.505
Don't worry about it.
It's very clear to him.

01:05:16.539 --> 01:05:18.598
He knows you're a Hong Kong cop.

01:06:57.973 --> 01:07:00.635
-Get our boat ready.
-Yes, sir.

01:07:00.676 --> 01:07:02.541
Six tickets, please.

01:07:05.948 --> 01:07:09.145
-What happened?
-Quick! He needs an ambulance!

01:07:09.185 --> 01:07:11.312
Sorry. You can't come in here.

01:07:11.353 --> 01:07:12.650
What's going on?

01:07:12.688 --> 01:07:15.623
Take him. Get him up!

01:07:18.327 --> 01:07:20.192
Where did they go?

01:07:23.365 --> 01:07:25.492
Fix him.

01:07:25.534 --> 01:07:28.526
Lock them up.
You two, come with me.

01:07:34.543 --> 01:07:36.738
Get him !

01:07:42.551 --> 01:07:44.746
Go down! Get him !

01:07:50.226 --> 01:07:52.023
Faster!

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:42.533
Go!

01:08:45.648 --> 01:08:46.774
Shark!

01:08:46.814 --> 01:08:48.077
Sharks don't bite.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.578
Go back in!

01:08:53.221 --> 01:08:54.814
There's a shark!

01:08:54.857 --> 01:08:57.883
It's just a small shark!
Get the weapon!

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.087
Go down!

01:10:58.781 --> 01:11:00.248
Did you see it?

01:11:00.282 --> 01:11:02.147
Yes, I think so.
I think Jackie has it.

01:11:02.184 --> 01:11:04.652
-Go down and get it!
-Two already died.

01:11:04.687 --> 01:11:06.416
That's an order!

01:11:06.455 --> 01:11:08.480
No. I won't.

01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:19.460
I can see them
from the restaurant.

01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:20.661
Let's go.

01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:23.466
Excuse me. Is that a new show?

01:11:23.505 --> 01:11:25.598
-Yeah. What's going on?
-I don't know.

01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:32.937
Take a look at this.

01:11:36.685 --> 01:11:38.277
What's going on in there?

01:12:51.193 --> 01:12:54.026
Get back. Get back!

01:12:54.062 --> 01:12:55.461
Back!

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:57.431
Nobody move!

01:12:57.466 --> 01:12:59.161
Stay where you are!

01:13:04.807 --> 01:13:06.331
Follow me!

01:13:12.915 --> 01:13:15.008
-Give me the gun.
-Yes, sir.

01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:41.369
Get her.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.142
Move! Get back!

01:13:47.182 --> 01:13:49.446
Help! No!

01:14:02.498 --> 01:14:03.658
Help!

01:14:06.134 --> 01:14:07.761
Let's go.

01:14:25.654 --> 01:14:27.918
Go! Go!

01:14:34.196 --> 01:14:36.164
No! Let go!

01:14:58.053 --> 01:14:59.645
The boat is ready.
Quickly, let's go!

01:15:07.362 --> 01:15:10.126
Shut up. Get in.

01:15:20.008 --> 01:15:21.407
Good-bye!

01:15:52.674 --> 01:15:54.232
Tie her up!

01:15:58.614 --> 01:16:00.548
Run!

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.812
You have put your country
to shame.

01:16:41.857 --> 01:16:43.950
Go. Get moving.

01:16:45.427 --> 01:16:46.826
Move it.

01:16:48.397 --> 01:16:49.728
Your turn.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.306
When you get back,
write a report...

01:17:01.343 --> 01:17:03.743
which is detailed and simple,
starting from the beginning.

01:17:03.779 --> 01:17:04.939
Huh?

01:17:05.305 --> 01:17:11.277
