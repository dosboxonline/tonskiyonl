01:58.368 --> 01:59.619
Good morning.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.412
This is your wake—up call.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.998
Thank you for staying
at the new dannin inn.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.709
The time is 10:30 am.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.425
You have no new messages.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.056
- Johnny?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.935
Yeah? — never mind.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.362
Nas: Nerve
attenuation syndrome...

02:34.363 --> 02:36.948
- So where is home, Johnny?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.450
Home?

02:40.744 --> 02:41.744
Home?

02:45.040 --> 02:47.708
Would you believe I don't even know?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.920
- Yes, I would.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.007
- Going out?
- Just getting some ice.

02:58.679 --> 03:03.058
We've got, ice.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.247
Pick it up, ralfi.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.208
How about it, ralfi?

03:29.209 --> 03:31.627
You said you'd lock down
a date for the procedure.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.295
And hello to you too.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.799
Ralfi, the date, when?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.175
I'm sorry, Johnny.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.845
The shiba neurosurgeons
have changed their quote.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.347
- You told me 800k would cover it.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.726
The fee for removing the
implant is now 1 million—5.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.936
That is complete memory recovery.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.315
If you don't want it all back,
I think they will come down.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.571
If I just wanted the silicon
dug out of my back brain,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.740
I could go to Mexico City.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.992
I want a full restoration!

04:02.993 --> 04:05.286
I want it all back!

04:05.287 --> 04:08.414
Johnny, the shiba
boys, they set the price.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.709
- I've done what I can.
- Come on, ralfi!

04:11.918 --> 04:15.463
- One more run, Johnny, and
then you could cover it,

04:15.464 --> 04:17.048
provided it's a rich one.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.304
- So, what have you got?
- — It depends.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.599
Did you get that upgrade
we were discussing?

04:27.058 --> 04:28.851
- — Yeah.
- Very good.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.230
Pickup is in central Beijing
tomorrow night, 10:00.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.274
This is a big one.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.318
Don't be late, Johnny.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.226
Paging Mr. Smith.

05:52.227 --> 05:57.440
Paging Mr. Smith.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.530
Nas, the so-called black shakes,

06:04.531 --> 06:05.948
first identified in 2010

06:05.949 --> 06:09.201
in a small population of
nonnegian information—...

06:09.202 --> 06:11.328
- Snatch back your brain, zombie!

06:11.329 --> 06:13.539
Snatch it back and hold it.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.165
Sorry, technical difficulty.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.919
Please come in.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.148
Activating pemex memory doubler.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.192
Your present capacity: 80 gigabytes.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.361
Doubler loading.

06:49.326 --> 06:53.245
Your storage capacity
is now 160 gigabytes.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.081
Warning: Do not exceed capacity.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.595
The courier is late! — be calm.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.942
- Double cheese, anchovies?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.362
- You are mister... — Smith.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.656
- You are late.
- Right.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.126
Question. — yes?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.005
You don't look like the kind
of people I usually work for.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.841
- We are new at this.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.094
No shit.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.930
- We approached you through
the correct channels.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.765
We paid half in advance
to the Swiss account,

07:54.766 --> 07:57.267
exactly as your agent instructed.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.437
Here's your ticket, first class.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.525
- Let's see what you wanna upload.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.656
Motion detector.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.743
How much am I carrying?

08:14.744 --> 08:16.538
- 320 gigabytes.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.457
Your storage capacity?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.460
Where am I taking it? — Newark.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.297
- Your storage capacity?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.136
- More than adequate.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.268
It is extremely dangerous

08:39.269 --> 08:42.479
If the upload volume exceeds
your storage capacity.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.441
Synaptic seepage can kill
you in two or three days.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.318
Plus, the data may be corrupted,

08:48.319 --> 08:51.573
and coherent download will be impossible.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.130
We don't have a problem with that, okay?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.291
We loading or not?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.251
Your ticket.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.587
Ralfi, your agent in Newark,

09:06.588 --> 09:08.631
will arrange the meet for the download.

09:54.594 --> 09:59.599
When
the counter approaches zero,

09:59.724 --> 10:04.311
click on three frames
off the TV, any three.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.939
They'll meld with the data and
I won't know what they are.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.316
That's the download code.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.860
You get a hard copy.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.947
You fax one copy to your
connection on the other side.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.658
When I get there, we feed
in the code and download.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.659
Understand?

10:27.502 --> 10:30.880
Upload begins when you press here.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.220
- — Who's the target?
- Scientists.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.808
Pharmakom r & d people, defectors.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.103
Hflme

11:29.772 --> 11:30.772
- The access code.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.730
Mr. Smith?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.443
Where's the bathroom?

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
What? — the toilet.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.038
Destroy the original!

12:28.039 --> 12:29.624
Fax the images to Newark.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.220
Oh, Jesus!

12:43.221 --> 12:47.350
Jesus! Shit!

13:16.421 --> 13:19.215
Water temperature is 17 degrees.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.021
Next time, knock, baldy.

14:35.041 --> 14:39.211
Transmission commencing.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.762
Transmission interrupted.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.236
Get him!

15:19.710 --> 15:24.173
You, where is he going?

15:26.217 --> 15:30.930
- Where is he taking the data?
- Newark!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.467
J' now here, you creeps,
punks and freaks j'

16:08.468 --> 16:11.261
I I'm talkin' 'bout
virus from the street j'

16:11.262 --> 16:13.722
j' spread that virus, go for hell I

16:13.723 --> 16:16.641
j' check out the
resistance of your cells j'

16:16.642 --> 16:18.810
j' smoke some dope, waste your brain j'

16:18.811 --> 16:22.022
j' kick your health outta the drain I

16:22.023 --> 16:24.774
j' fuel injection make you high I

16:24.775 --> 16:27.319
j' ram it up your
poop-chute, you know why I

16:27.320 --> 16:30.614
Immigration
control. Please insert passport.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.203
Beginning scan.

16:38.206 --> 16:42.126

16:54.514 --> 16:56.848
Seek medical attention immediately.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.851
- — Thank you.
- Welcome to Newark.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.314
Final boarding call for.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.317
Tokyo wants me to
recover the stolen data

17:49.318 --> 17:52.028
for pharmakominat industries of Zurich.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.866
Our operation in Beijing
met with limited success.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.994
The pharmakom traitors are dead.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.496
The courier, however,
escaped with the data.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.498
He's on his way here to Newark.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.837
I didn't want to disturb
you in your time of grief.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.715
It must be very difficult
to lose an only child.

18:17.555 --> 18:21.391
I'm not at Liberty to say.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.270
I've been charged with recovering

18:25.271 --> 18:28.481
the head of the mnemonic
courier, cryogenically preserved.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.566
Preserved?

18:29.567 --> 18:32.152
The traitors wiped
the pharmakom mainframe.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.530
If we lose the courier,
they've lost the data forever.

18:35.531 --> 18:40.452
If the courier is in Newark,
it's my responsibility.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.164
You have part of the
courier's download code.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.315
- Just what's the deal here?
- Johnny boy...

19:10.316 --> 19:13.401
- Johnny boy, my ass. What's
the fucking score here?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.071
I'm way overloaded, man.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.198
You would not believe how much.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.825
- You told me you got upgraded.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.827
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.079
I got the goods, ralfi.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.789
Now I just wanna get them out of my head.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.833
Did they get the code out?
— don't worry.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.462
They said they can extract.
— extract?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.758
What's going on, ralfi?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.843
This feels like a blown deal, man.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.471
- You say you have to get the data out.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.140
They are the only ones who can do it.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.851
There's no other choice. Trust me.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.770
I will tell the driver where to take you.

19:48.771 --> 19:49.771
- Yeah, sure.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.710
- Spider, I need to get some work.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.253
- About these episodes you've been having,

20:13.254 --> 20:16.756
I wanna get you back to
the shop for some tests.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.259
Hey, are you listening?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.219
No more playing doctor, remember?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.763
Oh, that's not what I meant.

20:26.809 --> 20:30.478
Look at them. They must be
the oldest bodyguards in town.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.564
I'm twice as fast as they are.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.898
Not worried about your speed.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.483
I'm worried about your nervous system,

20:35.484 --> 20:38.154
especially if you wanna
continue being a bodyguard.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.619
Get out of here, bitch.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.620
Take it easy!

20:50.374 --> 20:53.418
Your hired muscle is
aging on you, ralfi.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.920
I could've done ya.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.631
Time you hired yourself
some young and fast, hmm?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.216
- You mean, like you?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.678
- You're the best agent
for bodyguards in town.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.265
I'm the fastest thing going,
now spider's jacked my system.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.350
- Hold out your hand.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.435
Okay.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.691
Fine. Just hold it there.

21:19.487 --> 21:22.155
- So?
- Just hold it there.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.491
You can hold it there, baby, can't you?

21:24.492 --> 21:25.492
- Yeah, sure.

21:28.954 --> 21:29.954
See?

21:31.081 --> 21:32.917
- Cheap street implants.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.294
- You're damaged goods, bitch.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.588
Spiderman jacked you up, all right.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.966
- Jacked her up so tight, she shakes.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.844
- I cannot use you, not for muscle.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.640
Ever considered something a
little less actively physical?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.350
Like on your back, babe?

21:50.351 --> 21:53.187
Ah, ooh! Or on your knees.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.857
I'll get a gig, ralfi.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.277
- Then I'm coming back for you.
- Sure.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.638
Yo, j—bone.

22:41.527 --> 22:42.695
What you clocking, man?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.322
- Some suit out from the city.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.534
What for? — I don't know.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.203
Suits don't come out here.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.189
You're Johnny?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.902
- Am I?
- I sure hope so.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.113
Come on in. We're here to help you.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.000
We've gotta
stop meeting like this.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.754
- Baldy!
- — doctor will see you now.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.592
You lied.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.135
Yeah.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.311
Time to die. — time?

24:12.117 --> 24:15.787
We've got all night, asshole!

24:15.788 --> 24:16.664
Let me see that...

24:16.665 --> 24:18.332
- Yo, toad, I said shut up, man.

24:40.020 --> 24:44.190
Yo, j—man.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.345
Toad...

25:17.266 --> 25:19.183
You weren't on the menu.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.185
I want you to do something for me.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.814
- — Do?
- Yes. Say bye.

25:33.657 --> 25:38.746
Hold it right there.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.101
You tooling up for an
evening of this stuff, huh?

26:02.102 --> 26:06.272
As long as you understand
one thing, we're even.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.524
I don't owe you shit.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.693
Who are you?

26:11.779 --> 26:12.779
I'm j—bone.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.739
I run heaven.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.495
The lotek headquarters.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.008
J' easy as apple pie j'

26:34.009 --> 26:36.135
j' easy as j'

26:36.136 --> 26:37.096
Johnny!

26:37.097 --> 26:38.429
They were waiting for me, ralfi,

26:38.430 --> 26:40.723
two big nasty men!

26:40.724 --> 26:42.975
- Johnny, please, let me explain.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.355
- Johnny!
- You set me up, my friend.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.107
Johnny, it's not my fault.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.442
There's been a screw up!

26:51.610 --> 26:53.611
- You're dead if you don't
get this batch of product

26:53.612 --> 26:56.989
out of my head.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.990
- Shit!

26:59.743 --> 27:01.994
Not on the head!

27:01.995 --> 27:04.372
Don't tell me you hit him on the head.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.896
Hooky, give me my shit.

27:28.814 --> 27:29.814
Come on.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.025
Shit!

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
Shit.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.556
Looks like he's coming round.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.188
How are you feeling, Johnny?

28:10.606 --> 28:12.815
What'd they upload, ralfi,

28:12.816 --> 28:15.693
the goddamn library of congress?

28:15.694 --> 28:18.696
Feels like my brain's gonna explode.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.450
I think yourfriend here,
he can take care of that.

28:28.832 --> 28:31.042
Ralfi,

28:31.043 --> 28:33.461
you lying sack of shit.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.671
- Please let's work
this out like gentlemen.

28:35.672 --> 28:36.923
Johnny, in this business,

28:36.924 --> 28:39.634
you only fuck up once with yakuza.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.094
- We'll need a bucket.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.809
Put it here beside the table.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.562
- Can we talk about this?
- Talk?

28:52.064 --> 28:53.648
I have one image of the access code.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.233
You have the other two.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.443
I'll give you the data. Everybody happy.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.029
You don't understand.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.697
They don't just want the data,

29:01.698 --> 29:04.075
they want everything
it's ever been stored in.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.535
There's less danger of information decay.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.080
And we don't have to worry
about anyone going in

29:09.081 --> 29:10.540
with mnemonic sensors.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.253
These days, you see,

29:17.923 --> 29:20.007
Dead men can tell tales.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.261
- There's gotta be a way to work this out!

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
There is.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.563
- Would you hurry it up, please?

29:48.954 --> 29:51.038
What the fuck is going on?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.790
I'll slit his fucking throat, bitch.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.419
- So? Other guy gonna
cut his whole head off.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.672
- Jane, Jane, what say we
pay you for a night's work

29:59.673 --> 30:02.717
and you just walk away?
— I'll pay you 20 grand.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.386
You wouldn't
believe the shit you're in.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.387
- 50.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.807
Deal!

30:09.808 --> 30:15.022
Ah, you bitch!

30:41.173 --> 30:43.299
We'll be okay, I got the gun. Let's go.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.013
Time to go!

30:49.181 --> 30:50.724
Bitch!

30:57.272 --> 30:59.273
- You could have fucking killed me!

30:59.274 --> 31:01.401
Get out of the way!

31:19.461 --> 31:21.463
What are you doing? — my gear.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.374
In here.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.933
- Back door. — thanks, j—bone.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.271
We'll find you again! Count on it!

33:05.317 --> 33:06.317
Down!

33:09.362 --> 33:11.406
You loteks will regret this.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.164
I have to get online.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.249
Must be somebody I can
talk to to square this.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.460
- 50 thou, you said.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.216
Time I see the color, right?
— right.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.051
You were terrific.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.010
So if you'll just point the way out

33:33.011 --> 33:34.678
and give me an account number
for the cash transfer—...

33:34.679 --> 33:36.056
Account number?

33:37.933 --> 33:39.601
I'm on you till you pay, mister.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.608
How come they wanna cut
off your head anyway?

33:47.609 --> 33:50.277
I mean, usually they just
off people around here.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.362
Long story.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.907
Well, I'm gonna be around
until I get paid, so...

33:54.908 --> 33:57.535
I can carry nearly 80
gigs of data in my head,

33:57.536 --> 33:59.119
160 if I use a doubler.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.205
Trouble is, somebody stuck
in a lot more than that

34:01.206 --> 34:02.623
and I don't know how to get it back out.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.208
Okay, so wait a minute. Wait a minute.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.585
You're a smuggler? In your head?

34:08.338 --> 34:09.923
Hey! What's wrong?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.054
Come here. Sit down, sit down!

34:20.684 --> 34:22.477
Oh, man, you are fucked up severe.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.731
Stay quiet, boy.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.276
Shh, okay? Okay?

34:36.533 --> 34:38.326
Papa.

34:42.872 --> 34:46.584
- Takahashi, how sad, the loss of a child.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.046
They know that your purpose
in life has been lost.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.424
It died with your daughter.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.843
You have become a risk to them.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.220
Take a good look at their errand boy,

34:58.221 --> 35:01.015
the one who wants the courier's head.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.142
He's plotting to destroy you.

35:03.143 --> 35:05.103
You must neutralize him, Takahashi.

35:06.396 --> 35:07.480
I promise you,

35:08.607 --> 35:12.192
the courier, what he carries

35:12.193 --> 35:14.653
can give you new a purpose in life.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.073
I was pharmakom. And I...

35:19.618 --> 35:21.161
They're listening.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.164
They're everywhere.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.270
Huh.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.902
Oh, it's just my stuff.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.614
Mace, throwing spikes, grenade,

35:58.657 --> 36:00.992
everything a girl needs.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.287
- You let me sleep?

36:06.081 --> 36:07.457
- You needed it.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.087
I told you I was in a hurry.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.674
I'm a dead man if! Don't
get this out of my head.

36:20.637 --> 36:24.098
- Hey, do you ever sneak
a look at what you carry?

36:24.099 --> 36:27.893
- Usually, there's a code, like a lock.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.355
Well, when there isn't? — no.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.606
It goes with the territory.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.068
Safer for me, safer for the client.

36:36.236 --> 36:39.406
How come you knew those...
— oh, call them loteks.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.367
I sort of hung with them when I was a kid.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.372
Say, how do you fit all that
shit in your head, anyway?

36:48.665 --> 36:50.959
Must've been pretty
good at memorizing, huh?

36:51.835 --> 36:54.336
Implant, wet-wired.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.338
I had to dump a chunk of long—term memory.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.133
- You had to dump a chunk of what?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
- My childhood.
- — your childhood?

37:04.347 --> 37:05.932
Really?

37:08.351 --> 37:09.351
All of it?

37:10.270 --> 37:11.688
You can't remember a thing?

37:12.772 --> 37:15.149
- Maybe there's some residual traces.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.358
Every now and then, there's something,

37:16.359 --> 37:18.653
but I can never hold onto it.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.780
That's a seriously
weird—ass thing to do.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.616
Yeah, well, maybe I didn't
lose anything I wanted to keep.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.910
I needed the space for the job.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.288
Well, you got parents and stuff?

37:29.289 --> 37:32.876
- You got parents and stuff?
- — yeah.

37:33.877 --> 37:37.337
Once, but I haven't seen them in years.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.967
Yeah. Anyways, I don't
think about it much, okay?

37:42.177 --> 37:43.762
- So, what do you think about?

37:45.638 --> 37:47.931
When you're alone?

37:47.932 --> 37:51.602
I think I want to get
out of this rat hole.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.356
I want to get online. I need a computer.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.026
Where'd you learn to do that?

37:59.027 --> 38:02.447
- I used to have a summer
job breaking and entering.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.886
I need a sino-logic 16,

38:25.887 --> 38:29.848
sogo 7 data gloves, a gpl stealth module,

38:29.849 --> 38:33.978
one burdine intelligent
translator, a thomson I—phone.

He'll try to make a move.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.278
He'll use his connections on the net.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.322

Nothing but a name, Dr. Allcome.

40:58.581 --> 41:01.042
Nothing came through. Shit!

41:07.674 --> 41:09.007
- Let's go, okay?

41:09.008 --> 41:11.970
No, I'm gonna try something
else, a guy called strike.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.721
He runs a board in this
sector, owes me a favor.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.641
Maybe he can find this doctor for me.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.562
We locked on him.

41:22.563 --> 41:26.400
He's using a sino-logic
16 gpl stealth module.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.589
You are too hot.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.843
You're a hit waiting to happen.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.470
- Off!
- You owe me, strike.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.389
I don't owe you that much.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.099
- I could crash you from here, man,

41:59.100 --> 42:00.684
wipe out your entire fucking board!

42:00.685 --> 42:04.855
Johnny, don't, man.
That's my livelihood.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.982
Then stop bullshitting me!

42:06.983 --> 42:08.400
I need to know what I'm holding, strike.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.568
Why is the yakuza after it?

42:09.569 --> 42:10.569
Who's Dr. Allcome?

42:11.362 --> 42:16.576
All I know is, you've got
a head full of pharmakom data

42:16.617 --> 42:19.704
and they've hired the
yakuza to get it out.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.664
Pharmakom?

42:22.957 --> 42:28.171
Shit! They put a virus on us.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.051
- — Shit!
- Get out of here, man.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.888
I never heard of any Dr. Allcome.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.684
Johnny. Hurry, Johnny, they're coming!

42:42.685 --> 42:45.896
- — Who the hell are you?
- Gotta go now.

42:45.897 --> 42:46.897
Come on.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.031
Watch this.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.755
Inform Takahashi his tracker was late

43:11.756 --> 43:13.049
in locating the courier.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.177
It seems he's already departed.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.808
Mr. Takahashi,
shinji has failed again

43:22.809 --> 43:24.226
to locate the courier.

43:24.227 --> 43:25.394
Get me Karl.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.649
Church of the retransfiguration.

43:30.650 --> 43:31.818
Thank you for calling.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.994
- I need your services.

43:42.995 --> 43:46.165
- We hold services nightly.
- You should join us.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.917
- A special one.

43:48.918 --> 43:53.214
- Do you need someone brought to Jesus?

43:55.883 --> 43:59.303
- Or to you?
- Only one part, his head.

44:00.346 --> 44:03.682
And who is this lost soul,

44:03.683 --> 44:07.227
this sinner unrepentant?

44:07.228 --> 44:10.730
- A courier, last seen at the drome.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.566
Name is Johnny.

44:12.567 --> 44:17.780
If you get me the head in
24 hours, triple the fee.

44:23.744 --> 44:27.248
Karl, do not fail me.

44:33.254 --> 44:36.048
Hey! What are you doing?

44:40.511 --> 44:42.554
Mind if! Use this?
— man owes me 50 thou

44:42.555 --> 44:44.723
and he's scamming my phone card.

44:44.724 --> 44:46.309
And it's still our first date.

44:52.064 --> 44:56.776
Welcome to at&t.

44:56.777 --> 45:00.198
Enter password, please.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.419
This is an unlisted
number. How did you get it?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.129
Don't like surprises? — no.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.424
And it's a federal offense
to hack shielded lines.

45:19.425 --> 45:23.553
I have 320 gigabytes of pharmakom data.

45:23.554 --> 45:27.058
Don't bother. I'll be out
of here in 20 seconds.

45:28.059 --> 45:31.394
So, what exactly is it that you want?

45:31.395 --> 45:34.148
- Your data out of my head.
- — that can be arranged.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.858
Let's meet. — where?

45:36.859 --> 45:37.859
You're crazy, man!

45:37.860 --> 45:39.027
They're gonna chop your fucking head off!

45:39.028 --> 45:41.363
No. They'll negotiate,
they're corporate.

45:41.364 --> 45:42.531
- So is the yakuza.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.408
Listen, if you don't come, fine.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.827
It's a business meeting,
it's not your kinda scene.

45:47.828 --> 45:50.080
If it works out, I'll pay
you the money I owe you.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.164
If it doesn't... — if it doesn't,

45:51.165 --> 45:53.541
you're one dead Johnny is what!

45:53.542 --> 45:54.418
I'm gonna be dead anyway

45:54.419 --> 45:56.045
if I don't get this shit outta my head!

46:00.174 --> 46:01.174
Listen.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.846
I know this guy spider,
used to be a doctor.

46:07.431 --> 46:10.892
He could help you. He could fix your...

46:10.893 --> 46:12.687
Hey, what's with you?

46:16.190 --> 46:17.983
I'll be all right.

46:17.984 --> 46:19.151
- Jesus, you're sick.

46:20.361 --> 46:22.612
You strung out or what?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.823
You got nas! — no!

46:24.824 --> 46:26.366
You have the black shakes.

46:26.367 --> 46:29.370
Whatever it is you have,
you're sidelined, right?

46:31.122 --> 46:32.081
I've gotta make this meeting.

46:32.082 --> 46:34.083
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?

46:36.794 --> 46:41.381
Spider! He could help you.

46:41.382 --> 46:43.425
He could help me.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.624
If you're not
expected, then you're not invited!

47:16.625 --> 47:18.418
So fuck off, okay?

47:18.419 --> 47:21.005
- It's Jane! She says you know her.

47:22.923 --> 47:25.384
Get down here, man. She's sick.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.200
Look, I gotta run. — shut up.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.870
Give me that muscle relaxant
over there, the red one.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.294
- It's nas, right?
- — yeah, the black shakes,

48:01.295 --> 48:03.755
like half the people on the planet.

48:03.756 --> 48:06.299
Let me tell you something
so you get this straight.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.636
It's not my work that got her
this way. My work is clean.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.638
Besides, you don't get
this shit from amp jobs.

48:11.639 --> 48:12.722
That's just a myth.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.183
- So, what does cause it?
- What causes it?

48:15.184 --> 48:17.727
The world causes it. This causes it!

48:17.728 --> 48:20.021
This causes it! This causes it!

48:20.022 --> 48:21.940
Information overload!

48:21.941 --> 48:24.984
All the electronics around
you poisoning the ainnaves!

48:24.985 --> 48:27.612
Technological fucking civilization!

48:27.613 --> 48:29.489
But we still have all this shit

48:29.490 --> 48:31.741
'cause we can't live without it.

48:31.742 --> 48:32.910
Let me do my work.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.258
Whoa, street preacher's out.

48:50.177 --> 48:51.262
J-bone, you copying?

48:52.346 --> 48:53.596
That son of a bitch doesn't have

48:53.597 --> 48:56.224
one natural bone left in his body.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.435
- He really a preacher, j-bone?

48:58.436 --> 48:59.436
Preacher?

48:59.437 --> 49:02.605
That motherfucker's got god
and technology ass-backwards.

49:02.606 --> 49:03.731
He'll kill for anybody money

49:03.732 --> 49:06.109
just to keep his body full of implants.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.611
- — Want me to follow him?
- No, stay away from him.

49:08.612 --> 49:09.613
He's too crazy.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.201
Anna kalmann, founder, former ceo

49:15.202 --> 49:18.496
of the multinational
pharmakominat industries, Zurich.

49:18.497 --> 49:21.166
Born the 1st of August, 1965.

49:21.167 --> 49:23.126
Died the 3rd of September, 2015.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.127
Died?

49:25.713 --> 49:26.838
Six years ago?

49:26.839 --> 49:29.966
She was imprinted to pharmakom's
neural-net installation

49:29.967 --> 49:32.677
in Zurich prior to onset of morbidity.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.137
Imprinted?

49:34.138 --> 49:36.598
Her neural—net persona
has Swiss citizenship

49:36.599 --> 49:40.019
under the artificial
intelligence laws of 2006.

49:40.936 --> 49:44.732
She advises the current board
from this state of being.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.617
Pharmakom, Newark.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.165
- Johnny. — what are you doing?

50:03.459 --> 50:06.544
Just looking.
— don't touch anything!

50:06.545 --> 50:08.880
Who the fuck are you anyway?

50:08.881 --> 50:11.091
- Johnny. — Johnny who?

50:12.593 --> 50:13.593
Just Johnny.

50:22.311 --> 50:24.437
It looks like a full—service shop here.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.356
How are you on brain implants?

50:26.357 --> 50:29.484
Silicon implants, neural
overlays, memory augmentation?

50:29.485 --> 50:32.779
- We don't get much of that out
here in Newark, just Johnny.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.074
Kind of upscale for us, you know?

50:36.325 --> 50:37.992
Got mine in Singapore.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.955
- Oh, yeah? What's your deal, just Johnny?

50:42.915 --> 50:46.001
I got this problem, up here.

50:47.378 --> 50:51.631
"They err in vision.
They stumble in judgment.

50:51.632 --> 50:56.053
"For all the tables are full
of vomit and filthiness,

50:58.639 --> 51:01.099
"so that there is no place clean."

51:01.100 --> 51:03.268
- You should have seen it before.

51:03.269 --> 51:06.564
- Isaiah.
- — Isaiah? Mine's hooky.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.199
Hey!

51:30.838 --> 51:32.463
The girl.

51:32.464 --> 51:35.134
The girl that took ralfi's
boy out of the backroom,

51:38.846 --> 51:40.013
who is she?

51:40.014 --> 51:43.349
- Do you expect me to
remember half the shit—...

51:43.350 --> 51:44.350
Heal!

51:51.108 --> 51:56.322
Oh, man, why'd you
have to do that?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.578
Who's the girl? — a wannabe.

52:03.579 --> 52:07.541
She's always hanging around
here looking for a job.

52:08.584 --> 52:10.294
Name? — it's Jane.

52:12.546 --> 52:16.090
More. — ooh.

52:16.091 --> 52:19.510
One of spider's jobs. — spider?

52:19.511 --> 52:23.307
- He's a flesh mechanic.
- Implants and shit, you know?

52:24.475 --> 52:28.770
They said he used to be a
legit doctor once, but...

52:28.771 --> 52:32.191
Where?

52:54.630 --> 52:58.091
They did some serious
shoehorning to get that in there.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.593
Skip the technical critique,
okay, I need some help here.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.970
You don't know the half of it.

53:02.971 --> 53:04.305
You must be hurting like hell.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.683
Think I need
you to tell me that?

53:06.684 --> 53:09.603
I got 320 gigs in here.
— oh, yeah?

53:11.188 --> 53:14.357
What is it exactly? What kind of stuff?

53:14.358 --> 53:16.275
I haven't got a clue.

53:16.276 --> 53:18.320
And I don't have a download code either.

53:26.704 --> 53:27.704
Hey.

53:30.833 --> 53:31.833
You doing okay?

53:33.544 --> 53:34.586
- Good girl, Janie.

53:35.587 --> 53:37.214
You brought him to the right place.

53:38.257 --> 53:40.092
- You can fix him?
- — I don't know.

53:41.218 --> 53:44.804
With his seepage, if I
could work a download,

53:44.805 --> 53:46.764
I don't know if the
product would be coherent.

53:46.765 --> 53:50.560
Fuck the product! I just want it out.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.062
I wish it was that simple.

53:53.939 --> 53:57.650
Allcome. Dr. Allcome,
ever hear that name?

53:57.651 --> 53:59.652
- Maybe. — where is he?

53:59.653 --> 54:00.779
- I said maybe!

54:01.655 --> 54:04.407
- Why do you wanna see him?
- Oh, come on, spider!

54:04.408 --> 54:06.492
I'll make sure just Johnny gets to see

54:06.493 --> 54:08.369
who he needs to see.

54:08.370 --> 54:12.290
But you, you need bed rest, downtime.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.291
- He's my client.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.337
I'm telling
you, you gotta sleep.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.923
Just tell me where to go.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.765
All right. I'll drive you.
— right.

54:38.650 --> 54:40.526
Halt, sinners! — fuck!

54:40.527 --> 54:45.741
Spider, look out!

54:47.117 --> 54:49.828
- — Who the fuck was that?
- You don't wanna know.

54:53.248 --> 54:54.792
Jesus.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.815
Where are we? — you'll see.

55:42.548 --> 55:44.173
He's been
this way for an hour now.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.494
I don't know what to do with him.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.595
If we still got any
paralon b, give him 20 mgs.

55:49.596 --> 55:51.556
Fucking pharmakom, man.

55:51.557 --> 55:53.725
That shit costs 2 grand per clinical unit.

55:58.772 --> 56:01.441
Keep him warm and bring me
his charts when you can.

56:13.537 --> 56:14.737
- Here are the charts, doctor.

56:16.582 --> 56:17.749
Where's Dr. Allcome?

56:18.834 --> 56:21.627
Dr. Allcome is a name used in hospitals

56:21.628 --> 56:23.129
when we got a major problem

56:23.130 --> 56:25.089
and don't wanna spook the patients.

56:25.090 --> 56:29.677
- — What?
- "Doctor all come to ward 7,"

56:29.678 --> 56:32.597
and we drop everything
and haul ass to wherever.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.641
Usually means we got a
crazy, somebody violent.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.810
But I saw it on the fax buffer.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.521
That fax was meant for us.

56:40.522 --> 56:42.356
Who's us?

56:42.357 --> 56:44.401
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

56:47.029 --> 56:49.572
Who's us? — the nas underground,

56:49.573 --> 56:51.490
people who keep this place going,

56:51.491 --> 56:52.491
people like me.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.243
Get on the table.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.788
- Why?
- — don't be a bigger asshole

56:57.789 --> 56:58.665
than you have to.

56:58.665 --> 56:59.665
Just get on the table.

57:09.384 --> 57:10.384
All right.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.428
Jackin.

57:20.103 --> 57:21.103
Lie down.

57:25.317 --> 57:26.944
Let's take a look at this shit.

57:29.780 --> 57:30.905
No access code?

57:30.906 --> 57:33.658
Except for one image, out of three.

57:33.659 --> 57:34.576
It won't help.

57:34.577 --> 57:36.410
What did they use? Random images?

57:36.411 --> 57:37.621
Yeah, from the TV.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.039
- I've got some decryption codes here.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.583
I'll run them, see if we
come up with anything.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.794
Janie, you should really try and lie down.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.045
- Can you break the code, spider?

57:46.046 --> 57:48.340
If I get lucky, really lucky.

58:09.111 --> 58:10.236
Fuck!

58:10.237 --> 58:12.446
- No dice?
- — no. But I can get it out.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.448
How?
— with a general anesthetic,

58:14.449 --> 58:16.492
a cranial drill, and pair of forceps.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.327
- And I could die too, right?

58:18.328 --> 58:20.955
It's gonna kill you
anyway when it ruptures.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.249
I take it out, you'll probably survive.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.209
You'll probably lose
some fine motor skills,

58:25.210 --> 58:26.585
you might not be able to remember anything

58:26.586 --> 58:28.045
for more than three minutes at a time.

58:28.046 --> 58:29.047
Fuck that!

58:31.133 --> 58:32.508
Let me tell you something!

58:32.509 --> 58:34.343
Let's just start with
what you got in there

58:34.344 --> 58:35.220
and what it's worth,

58:35.221 --> 58:37.680
what it's worth to the world.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.433
You're carrying the cure for nas.

58:41.935 --> 58:44.770
You're telling me I got-—
— pharmakom's complete r & d

58:44.771 --> 58:47.440
on their cure for nerve
attenuation syndrome.

58:47.441 --> 58:50.317
Plus the records of the field
trials to prove that it works.

58:50.318 --> 58:51.778
And it really works.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.156
You mean, like, a real cure?

58:55.157 --> 58:56.407
They could have you straightened out

58:56.408 --> 58:59.202
in three weeks, Janie,
you and everybody else.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.913
- Everybody's trying to cut off my head.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.498
- So they can take it back to Saigon

59:04.499 --> 59:06.917
and run it through a quantum
interference detector.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.086
But then, they would have
the cure and we wouldn't.

59:09.087 --> 59:11.964
You keep that thing in your
head and nobody can save you.

59:11.965 --> 59:14.341
Plus, the cure is gone forever.

59:14.342 --> 59:16.218
I can save the cure.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.471
Even if we had the code,
the seepage is so bad,

59:18.472 --> 59:20.139
it would probably come out as garbage.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.933
What's it supposed to
matter to me if I'm dead?

59:22.934 --> 59:25.811
- Follow me?
- The cure can save millions.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.273
You're gonna die anyway
if we don't get it out.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.653
All I know is that
whatever's in my head is

59:34.654 --> 59:36.447
worth a lot of money.

59:36.448 --> 59:37.866
Why should I trust you?

59:38.825 --> 59:42.536
You're supposed to be my
bodyguard here. Bodyguard!

59:42.537 --> 59:44.080
You're not walking outta here,

59:44.081 --> 59:45.790
not with that cure in your head!

59:50.170 --> 59:53.548
That cure is mine!

59:56.134 --> 59:57.594
Behold, your savior!

1:00:15.529 --> 1:00:18.364
- Jane, get him to Jones!
- It's your only chance!

1:00:18.365 --> 1:00:22.451
Go! Get him to Jones!

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:23.452
Go!

1:00:27.415 --> 1:00:29.792
Who's Jones?

1:00:29.793 --> 1:00:35.006
He's that guy who fucks
your mother.

1:00:45.559 --> 1:00:46.560
Where are they?

1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:04.368
I couldn't make the meeting,
but I'm still up for it.

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:05.995
Are you?

1:01:05.996 --> 1:01:07.580
- Certainly.

1:01:07.581 --> 1:01:11.167
This time, on the bridge, landfill 5.

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:14.003
Bring the rest of the code. I'll find you.

1:01:14.004 --> 1:01:15.880
I'll be there.

1:01:15.881 --> 1:01:17.174
I want to negotiate.

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:19.008
- Yes, sir.

1:01:20.927 --> 1:01:24.222
Great. Now if they don't
kill you, j—bone will.

1:01:32.105 --> 1:01:34.523
Listen to me, Takahashi,
before it's too late.

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:37.151
We're running out of time.
He's carrying the cure for—...

1:02:08.558 --> 1:02:09.558
Hey!

1:02:10.477 --> 1:02:11.477
Hey!

1:02:14.272 --> 1:02:17.066
I told her if she wanna get with me,

1:02:17.067 --> 1:02:19.026
then I wanna get with her.

1:02:19.027 --> 1:02:20.277
And screw the physical disability.

1:02:20.278 --> 1:02:22.488
Hey! — you know what I'm saying?

1:02:22.489 --> 1:02:24.699
Because it's about the feeling, right?

1:02:26.326 --> 1:02:27.326
What's up?

1:02:28.912 --> 1:02:30.038
Wind maybe.

1:02:31.665 --> 1:02:32.665
Hey!

1:02:39.547 --> 1:02:41.090
What do you think?

1:02:41.091 --> 1:02:41.967
I mean, it's crazy,

1:02:41.968 --> 1:02:44.593
but if it's really the
cure to nas in my head,

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:45.594
it could save you.

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.848
I mean, it could save everybody.

1:02:55.814 --> 1:03:00.610
Well, who is this Jones guy
spider said was our only chance?

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:03.195
He's...

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:06.073
He's...

1:03:06.074 --> 1:03:07.866
He was in the Navy.

1:03:07.867 --> 1:03:08.993
Yeah, in the war.

1:03:08.994 --> 1:03:11.120
You know, they put a lot
of stuff in his head,

1:03:11.121 --> 1:03:12.080
kinda like you.

1:03:12.081 --> 1:03:14.248
Oh, yeah, like memory augments?

1:03:14.249 --> 1:03:15.458
I don't know.

1:03:17.544 --> 1:03:18.544
You'll see.

1:03:24.134 --> 1:03:25.467
Hey!

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:29.263
- Man, somebody crazy down
there is getting on my nerves.

1:03:29.264 --> 1:03:31.974
Rat lands are full of crazies,
stick. Ignore it, man.

1:03:31.975 --> 1:03:34.059
Come on! Hey!

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:35.060
No, man.

1:03:37.230 --> 1:03:39.691
Right down there! It's spider's Van!

1:03:41.026 --> 1:03:44.779
Yep. Better tell j—bone.
— I got an idea.

1:03:45.905 --> 1:03:48.365
Let's drop a bug on spiderman.

1:03:48.366 --> 1:03:51.035
- — Forget it, stick.
- Hey, check it out,

1:03:51.036 --> 1:03:53.245
- I'm gonna do it.
- Hey, don't even say that.

1:03:53.246 --> 1:03:55.080
J—bone will shit if he hears you.

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:58.126
No, I'm gonna do it.
— hey, wake up, damn it!

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:01.086
Hey, shit, man!
— "hey, shit" nothing.

1:04:01.087 --> 1:04:02.755
That's what they're for.

1:04:02.756 --> 1:04:05.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa! — hey! Hey!

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:09.511
Fuck! Shit!

1:04:25.779 --> 1:04:27.405
What the fuck is going on?

1:04:30.033 --> 1:04:32.494
What the fuck is going on?

1:04:34.829 --> 1:04:35.829
You know,

1:04:37.457 --> 1:04:41.711
all my life, I've been careful
to stay in my own corner,

1:04:43.254 --> 1:04:46.007
looking out for number
one, no complications.

1:04:48.301 --> 1:04:53.473
Now, suddenly, I'm responsible
for the entire fucking world!

1:04:54.307 --> 1:04:57.101
And everybody and his mother
is trying to kill me, if,

1:04:57.102 --> 1:05:00.729
if, my head doesn't blow up first.

1:05:00.730 --> 1:05:03.400
- Maybe it's not just about you anymore.

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:09.905
Listen. You listen to me.

1:05:09.906 --> 1:05:11.908
You see that city over there?

1:05:13.118 --> 1:05:15.661
That's where I'm supposed to be.

1:05:15.662 --> 1:05:17.955
Not down here with the
dogs, and the garbage,

1:05:17.956 --> 1:05:19.623
and the fucking last month's newspapers

1:05:19.624 --> 1:05:21.084
blowing back and forth!

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:25.254
I've had it with them!

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:26.505
I've had it with you.

1:05:26.506 --> 1:05:28.091
I've had it with all this!

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:34.389
I want room service!

1:05:37.308 --> 1:05:39.143
I want the club sandwich!

1:05:39.144 --> 1:05:41.228
I want the cold Mexican beer!

1:05:41.229 --> 1:05:43.523
I want a $10,000—a—night hooker!

1:05:50.572 --> 1:05:52.323
I want my shirts laundered,

1:05:55.243 --> 1:05:58.830
like they do at the imperial hotel

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:03.543
in Tokyo.

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.628
We gotta see Jones.

1:06:48.588 --> 1:06:50.380
Spider sent us.

1:06:50.381 --> 1:06:51.381
Where's spider?

1:06:52.967 --> 1:06:53.967
- He's dead.

1:06:55.345 --> 1:06:58.097
Not in there. Earlier, at the hospital.

1:07:04.229 --> 1:07:06.814
If spider sent you, come on.

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:11.986
Whoa!

1:07:12.946 --> 1:07:14.780
J-bone, help me.

1:07:14.781 --> 1:07:16.990
Come on. Keep it together.

1:07:19.744 --> 1:07:20.744
Come on.

1:07:41.516 --> 1:07:42.975
Hoist it up!
— need help, right here.

1:07:42.976 --> 1:07:43.976
You two.

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:48.523
I got him. I got him!

1:07:49.774 --> 1:07:53.069
He'll be all right. Go on.

1:08:23.725 --> 1:08:25.767
Tell shinji,
meet me at the bridge.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:27.437
He's on his way, sir.

1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:31.107
My helicopter?
— It's waiting, sir.

1:09:01.346 --> 1:09:04.515
- You okay?
- I saw...

1:09:05.808 --> 1:09:06.809
I almost saw

1:09:08.645 --> 1:09:09.645
as if it was

1:09:12.273 --> 1:09:13.273
a memory.

1:09:24.911 --> 1:09:28.247
We have
a room especially for that.

1:09:31.042 --> 1:09:32.418
Time to meet Jones.

1:09:43.971 --> 1:09:47.349
We built heaven completely
out of straight—world junk,

1:09:47.350 --> 1:09:49.477
all hauled up here piece by piece.

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:51.978
We work with spider and his people

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:54.148
and anybody else who's
fighting the system.

1:09:55.108 --> 1:09:56.401
We out shit for them.

1:09:58.069 --> 1:10:00.321
- What do you mean, "out?"

1:10:09.455 --> 1:10:12.708
Heaven, it's heart and soul.

1:10:22.135 --> 1:10:23.885
This is where we fight back.

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:25.345
We strip the little, pretty pictures

1:10:25.346 --> 1:10:27.222
from their 500—channel universe,

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:31.059
recontextualize it, then we
spit the shit back at them.

1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:33.562
Special data, things that'll help people,

1:10:33.563 --> 1:10:35.106
like stuff we get from spider.

1:10:36.232 --> 1:10:38.108
We wide—band it.

1:10:38.109 --> 1:10:40.444
- Wide?
- Broadcast it. Go global.

1:10:40.445 --> 1:10:43.155
Bounce it off the satellites
that Jones hacks for us.

1:10:43.156 --> 1:10:44.906
The way the Navy got him hooked up,

1:10:44.907 --> 1:10:46.074
he cuts through hard encryption

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:47.909
like a knife cuts through butter.

1:10:47.910 --> 1:10:49.578
- Code breaker. Good.

1:10:49.579 --> 1:10:51.956
I can't wait to meet him.
— right this way.

1:10:57.754 --> 1:10:59.337
Jones.

1:11:04.969 --> 1:11:06.762
It's a fish.

1:11:10.475 --> 1:11:11.851
It's a mammal.

1:11:13.436 --> 1:11:15.480
He's a friend! He's a friend, sailor!

1:11:18.566 --> 1:11:21.109
This was spider's best bet?

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:23.571
Hey, one thing spider wasn't was stupid.

1:11:25.156 --> 1:11:28.950
Jones is set up to sample
software from enemy subs,

1:11:28.951 --> 1:11:32.121
infrasound scan, right through the hull.

1:12:08.115 --> 1:12:10.617
Jones will feed you can opener codes.

1:12:10.618 --> 1:12:12.244
We'll try to get you out in time.

1:12:12.245 --> 1:12:14.413
Wait a minute. Have
you done this before?

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:20.001
Has the fish?

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:23.213
- How dangerous is this?
- Just keep your head still.

1:12:23.214 --> 1:12:24.465
If you move around too much,

1:12:25.424 --> 1:12:27.176
could microwave yourfrontal lobe.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:32.305
Forget it.

1:12:33.266 --> 1:12:35.643
Look, man, at least you got a chance.

1:12:36.853 --> 1:12:37.853
It's up to you.

1:12:39.230 --> 1:12:40.481
Do what you gotta do.

1:12:54.829 --> 1:12:57.123
Give me what you got
of the download codes.

1:13:38.873 --> 1:13:41.082
Inputting first image.

1:13:41.083 --> 1:13:43.085
Set up the broadcast antennas.

1:14:02.396 --> 1:14:07.317
Now.

1:14:21.248 --> 1:14:23.083
- Oh, you know, we were
just having a good time,

1:14:23.084 --> 1:14:24.250
just fooling around.

1:14:24.251 --> 1:14:26.336
Well, I don't wanna do nothing no more.

1:14:26.337 --> 1:14:27.797
And I don't care what it takes.

1:14:29.048 --> 1:14:30.633
Hear what I'm saying, buddy?

1:14:31.676 --> 1:14:35.637
Hey, buddy?

1:14:52.279 --> 1:14:53.279
Maroni!

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:08.170
Motherfuckers!

1:15:15.970 --> 1:15:17.638
Stations! You all know the drill!

1:15:34.947 --> 1:15:37.700
What did you get?
— we didn't get it.

1:15:39.827 --> 1:15:41.537
We're not gonna get it right now.

1:15:43.289 --> 1:15:45.165
The only way left is
to hack your own brain,

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:47.042
and then loop it through Jones.

1:15:47.043 --> 1:15:48.878
- J-bone, the fuel tanks!

1:15:51.338 --> 1:15:52.631
Shit, it's the yakuza.

1:15:54.258 --> 1:15:55.258
Give me that bow.

1:16:28.876 --> 1:16:30.710
I was almost there.

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:32.587
I could feel it starting to...

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:40.554
Mr. Smith?

1:16:42.932 --> 1:16:43.974
Pharmakom?

1:16:46.185 --> 1:16:47.520
Not really.

1:16:56.612 --> 1:16:58.114
- You can't shoot me.

1:16:59.323 --> 1:17:00.366
Not in the head.

1:17:14.296 --> 1:17:15.880
Takahashi!

1:17:15.881 --> 1:17:19.676
Do you know what this man
is carrying in his head?

1:17:19.677 --> 1:17:23.097
He's carrying the cure for nas.

1:17:24.056 --> 1:17:27.976
Your daughter died to protect
pharmakom's profit margin.

1:17:27.977 --> 1:17:32.730
Treating the disease is far
more profitable than curing it.

1:17:32.731 --> 1:17:36.776
They had the cure eight
months ago, Takahashi.

1:17:36.777 --> 1:17:39.780
Pharmakom, the company that I created,

1:17:41.407 --> 1:17:42.741
let your daughter die.

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.220
- Shinji.

1:18:09.059 --> 1:18:10.059
Hello, Johnny.

1:18:18.694 --> 1:18:19.694
Raise your chin.

1:18:20.821 --> 1:18:21.989
Let's make this clean.

1:19:38.190 --> 1:19:41.526
If I fall,

1:19:41.527 --> 1:19:43.361
you don't get the head, right?

1:19:43.362 --> 1:19:46.698
If you lose the head, you're fucked!

1:20:40.794 --> 1:20:42.712
- Jesus time.

1:21:51.532 --> 1:21:52.908
- Come to Jesus.

1:22:07.047 --> 1:22:08.132
The cure...

1:22:13.971 --> 1:22:16.431
He's made you
the vessel of his mercy

1:22:16.432 --> 1:22:18.891
as I am the vessel of his wrath.

1:22:21.186 --> 1:22:22.646
- Jones, Jones...

1:22:26.608 --> 1:22:28.276
What spawn of Satan?

1:22:32.406 --> 1:22:33.406
Now!

1:23:22.206 --> 1:23:23.206
-Jane?

1:23:31.465 --> 1:23:32.841
I'm all right.

1:23:44.353 --> 1:23:45.646
- Piece of shit.

1:23:46.855 --> 1:23:47.855
- Hook me up.

1:23:48.649 --> 1:23:49.649
The second image.

1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:55.154
- Get the power up.

1:24:13.090 --> 1:24:18.303
Johnny, the dolphin can
take you into the data.

1:24:19.429 --> 1:24:21.056
Find the third image.

1:24:23.267 --> 1:24:25.561
I knew their secrets.

1:24:26.645 --> 1:24:27.645
The image...

1:24:28.939 --> 1:24:32.567
The company has forgotten for me.

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:34.527
Now they erase me,

1:24:34.528 --> 1:24:37.072
burn me out of the mainframes,

1:24:37.990 --> 1:24:39.992
one memory after another.

1:24:41.243 --> 1:24:44.621
How very kind of them.

1:24:45.581 --> 1:24:46.581
Johnny...

1:24:49.501 --> 1:24:50.501
Johnny...

1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:53.671
Look, if we gonna do this
download, we gotta do it now.

1:24:53.672 --> 1:24:54.880
We're out of power.

1:25:01.597 --> 1:25:05.183
Remember, we gotta loop
it through Jones. Johnny?

1:25:07.811 --> 1:25:09.979
Okay, let's do this.

1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:11.439
Watch your ass, man.

1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.275
No telling what defenses
pharmakom stuck in there.

1:25:14.276 --> 1:25:16.278
Probably got virus programs.

1:25:17.446 --> 1:25:18.446
You ready?

1:25:19.239 --> 1:25:20.656
- Loop it.

1:25:42.929 --> 1:25:44.180
Listen up, world.

1:25:44.181 --> 1:25:46.641
This is the last blast from
lotek world headquarters.

1:25:46.642 --> 1:25:48.893
And believe this, we're
going out with a bang, baby.

1:25:48.894 --> 1:25:51.646
So get your vcrs ready
because we got what you need.

1:25:51.647 --> 1:25:53.898
We got the cure to nas.

1:25:53.899 --> 1:25:56.025
That's right, the cure
to the black shakes.

1:25:56.026 --> 1:25:58.778
And it's coming to you live
from the labs up at pharmakom.

1:25:58.779 --> 1:25:59.655
And believe this,

1:25:59.656 --> 1:26:02.114
they did not want you
to get this information.

1:26:02.115 --> 1:26:05.285
So here it is, coming at you, lotek style.

1:26:09.956 --> 1:26:13.084
Hit me.

1:26:22.969 --> 1:26:24.169
He's on his way in.

1:26:39.903 --> 1:26:41.947
Unauthorized interface attempt.

1:26:46.118 --> 1:26:48.829
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

1:26:57.838 --> 1:26:59.047
Final warning.

1:27:00.132 --> 1:27:02.592
Initiating virus program.

1:27:12.227 --> 1:27:13.937
He's doubling himself.

1:27:18.191 --> 1:27:21.236
Launching virus.

1:27:29.661 --> 1:27:31.620
That's the double. Don't worry.

1:27:41.256 --> 1:27:44.134
The only way is to hack your own brain.

1:27:55.979 --> 1:27:56.979
- Loop it.

1:28:15.457 --> 1:28:16.500
- Get ready!

1:28:17.918 --> 1:28:19.043
Send it out!

1:28:25.550 --> 1:28:27.761
Initiating download.

1:29:48.258 --> 1:29:49.884
Happy birthday, Johnny!

1:29:49.885 --> 1:29:53.805
- Happy birthday, Johnny.
- — thank you, mommy.

1:30:53.114 --> 1:30:54.866
- It's payback time.

1:31:12.258 --> 1:31:15.260
Just garbage. Get that outta here!

1:31:58.513 --> 1:32:00.597
J' I can seej'

1:32:00.598 --> 1:32:03.142
j' see the signs j'

1:32:03.143 --> 1:32:05.602
j' I've been waiting here for you j'

1:32:05.603 --> 1:32:07.604
I but nothing's getting through I

1:32:07.605 --> 1:32:09.732
j' I am gonej'

1:32:09.733 --> 1:32:12.776
j' up in the clouds j'

1:32:12.777 --> 1:32:15.029
j' praying I can turn I

1:32:15.030 --> 1:32:16.739
I turn myself around j'

1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:18.949
j' a year ago j'

1:32:18.950 --> 1:32:21.702
j' I gave it a year j'

1:32:21.703 --> 1:32:24.246
j' I hoped it wouldn't happen j'

1:32:24.247 --> 1:32:25.914
I now it's here j'

1:32:25.915 --> 1:32:27.958
I it took so long j'

1:32:27.959 --> 1:32:31.003
j' I can't carry on j'

1:32:31.004 --> 1:32:33.464
j' I know the reason that you left me I

1:32:33.465 --> 1:32:37.468
I you had nothing more to give me I

1:32:37.469 --> 1:32:42.182
j' no more love j'

1:32:51.691 --> 1:32:53.984
J' some nights I feel I

1:32:53.985 --> 1:32:56.278
I like I have died j'

1:32:56.279 --> 1:33:00.783
j' or something deep inside is dying j'

1:33:00.784 --> 1:33:05.454
j' I try to understand my crimes j'

1:33:05.455 --> 1:33:09.583
I but there's nothing
here that really matters I

1:33:09.584 --> 1:33:11.502
j' I don't want to believe in you j'

1:33:11.503 --> 1:33:16.716
j' I can't believe in you j'

1:33:18.718 --> 1:33:21.095
j' I don't want to believe in you j'

1:33:21.096 --> 1:33:26.309
j' I can't believe in you j'

1:33:26.810 --> 1:33:31.396
j' I don't want it, I don't need it I

1:33:31.397 --> 1:33:34.316
j' I don't want it I

1:33:34.317 --> 1:33:39.531
I but I can't stop myself j'

1:33:49.999 --> 1:33:55.213
J' mouth curling to a question Mark I

1:33:58.299 --> 1:34:03.513
j' head back describes an arc j'

1:34:06.391 --> 1:34:11.604
j' jaw's really slung, imprisoned words j'

1:34:14.732 --> 1:34:19.946
j' breath escaping, lips
long tightly sealed j'

1:34:21.072 --> 1:34:24.950
j' sentence is repealed j'

1:34:24.951 --> 1:34:28.829
I left without obeying j'

1:34:28.830 --> 1:34:33.000
j' internal is revealed j'

1:34:33.001 --> 1:34:35.210
j' can't hear a word you're saying j'

1:34:35.211 --> 1:34:40.425
j' this cell is so cold cold,
this cell is so cold cold j'

1:34:47.682 --> 1:34:52.896
J' mouth curling to a question Mark I
