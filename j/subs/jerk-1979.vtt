27:28.313 --> 27:29.610
It causes 'em to spread.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.707
So I put a little handle
right here in the center,

27:32.784 --> 27:35.344
and it puts the pressure on
the bridge where it belongs,

27:35.420 --> 27:37.786
just like the tie rods
on a '72 Buick.

27:37.855 --> 27:40.016
Plus, I put a little
nose break on them here

27:40.091 --> 27:42.025
to prevent slippage. Try it.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.850
Use the handle.

27:47.265 --> 27:48.857

living selling shit like this.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.173
if I can develop this gizmo,

27:58.242 --> 27:59.675
I'll split it with you 50/50.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.871
Okay, how much do I owe you
for the gas?

28:01.946 --> 28:03.470
I got a trunk load of shit
to sell.

28:03.548 --> 28:04.845

41:17.875 --> 41:20.469
I was... I was just
standing here right now and

41:20.711 --> 41:24.112
I was wondering if you weren't
doing anything tomorrow

41:26.750 --> 41:30.015
that maybe you might wanna
go out or...

41:31.522 --> 41:32.614
What?

41:34.224 --> 41:38.627
(BABBLING) I thought maybe you
might wanna go out with me.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.896
Are you trying to ask me
for a date?

41:42.933 --> 41:44.161
Well...

41:45.002 --> 41:48.096
Once for no, twice for yes.

41:51.608 --> 41:52.597
Okay.

41:53.811 --> 41:56.041
Um, you're so cute.

41:56.580 --> 41:59.981
How about 3:30 tomorrow
at the roundup?

42:00.050 --> 42:01.347
Okay.

42:04.421 --> 42:06.252
Do you have any boyfriends?

42:08.225 --> 42:09.283
Not really.

42:09.359 --> 42:10.792
Are they crazy?

42:10.861 --> 42:13.455
If I was a fella,
I'd be around all the time.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.691
Well, see if you can
work it out.

42:16.633 --> 42:18.624
We have a date tomorrow.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.270
What's your name?

42:22.539 --> 42:23.665
Marie.

42:25.309 --> 42:26.333
What's yours?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.037
I'll tell you tomorrow.

42:28.111 --> 42:31.080
It'll give us something
interesting to talk about.

42:48.432 --> 42:49.694
Hi.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.562
What's up, hubby?

42:53.537 --> 42:55.300
I got these for you.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.506
Thanks.

43:00.177 --> 43:03.510
Navin, you know the other day
when I showed you the tattoo?

43:03.580 --> 43:04.808
Yeah. Yeah.

43:05.549 --> 43:07.449
Well, I forgot
to tell you somethin'.

43:07.517 --> 43:09.007
Oh, really? What?

43:09.086 --> 43:10.417
This.

43:16.894 --> 43:18.987
And that's
what's gonna happen to you

43:19.062 --> 43:21.496
if I ever catch you looking
at another broad.

43:21.565 --> 43:23.089
I'm glad you told me.

43:23.166 --> 43:27.000
And remember,
I did this without anger.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.068
And I stayed away
from your crotch.

43:31.909 --> 43:33.501
Bye, sweetie.

43:35.979 --> 43:37.173
Hi.

43:37.447 --> 43:38.709
What happened?

43:39.016 --> 43:42.110
Oh, it was unbelievable.
These guys jumped me.

43:42.185 --> 43:43.743
Tried to get these flowers.

43:43.820 --> 43:45.219
I got 'em for you.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.757
It's kind of
a traditional date deal.

43:48.258 --> 43:51.284
Yeah, I've heard of that.
What were they?

43:51.995 --> 43:54.259
Uh, couple of dozen roses.

43:55.565 --> 43:56.964
Look like daisy stems.

43:57.034 --> 43:58.399
What?

43:58.468 --> 44:00.436
That guy gypped me.

44:00.504 --> 44:03.132
He put... put daisy stems
on my roses.

44:03.206 --> 44:04.468
(LAUGHING)

44:04.541 --> 44:06.702
Hey, look,
these hoodlums are dangerous.

44:06.777 --> 44:10.213
I think we ought to get out
of here before she sees us.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.304
She?

44:11.381 --> 44:12.370
What?

44:12.449 --> 44:13.780
You said "she."

44:13.850 --> 44:16.876
No. No.
I always call a gang "she."

44:17.087 --> 44:19.078
It's like
when you call a boat "she,"

44:19.156 --> 44:20.885
or... or a hurricane "she."

44:20.958 --> 44:22.289
Or a girl?

44:22.659 --> 44:24.422
A girl.
You can call a girl "she."

44:24.494 --> 44:27.327
That's just one of the many
things you can call "she."

44:28.532 --> 44:30.056
(MEN CHATTERING)

44:30.133 --> 44:31.896
MARIE: Why are you smiling?

44:32.703 --> 44:35.672
NAVIN: You're the first person
I've ever had in my place.

44:35.939 --> 44:38.601
Do you live here?
Oh, it's nice.

44:38.675 --> 44:40.404
So, did you decorate it?

44:40.477 --> 44:42.536
I got all this stuff from
the old Cup O' Pizza place

44:42.612 --> 44:44.443
before they tore it down.

44:47.985 --> 44:49.976
That was really good pizza.

44:50.053 --> 44:51.987
Oh, this is the best
pizza in a cup ever.

44:52.055 --> 44:53.579
This guy's unbelievable.

44:53.657 --> 44:55.784
He ran the old Cup O' Pizza
guy out of business.

44:55.859 --> 44:56.883
Really?

44:56.960 --> 44:59.394
People come from all over
to get this. Uh-huh.

45:01.631 --> 45:02.620
(SIGHING)

45:12.442 --> 45:15.343
You know,
you have beautiful skin.

45:18.548 --> 45:19.810
May I?

45:20.617 --> 45:21.675
Yes.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.654
So smooth and flexible.

45:29.793 --> 45:32.626
I take after my mother's side
of the family.

45:32.696 --> 45:36.632
It's amazing the way it just
snaps back like that. Amazing.

45:38.035 --> 45:39.627
Are you a model?

45:39.703 --> 45:40.727
No.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.836
I'm a cosmetologist.

45:45.442 --> 45:47.967
Really? A cosmetologist?

45:49.112 --> 45:52.639
That's unbelievable.
That's impressive.

45:53.717 --> 45:56.311
It must be tough to handle
the weightlessness.

45:58.321 --> 46:00.721
Can I ask you
a personal question?

46:01.892 --> 46:03.257
What is it?

46:05.162 --> 46:07.027
Now be totally honest.

46:08.365 --> 46:10.333
You do have a boyfriend,
don't you?

46:10.967 --> 46:12.332
Kind of.

46:14.337 --> 46:16.532
I know this is our first date

46:18.642 --> 46:20.269
but do you think

46:20.510 --> 46:23.445
the next time you make love
to your boyfriend,

46:24.581 --> 46:26.173
you could think of me?

46:26.650 --> 46:28.709
Well, I haven't
made love to him yet.

46:29.252 --> 46:30.583
That's too bad.

46:31.555 --> 46:34.547
Do you think
it's possible that some day

46:36.426 --> 46:39.054
you could make love with me
and think of him?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.460
Who knows?

46:40.630 --> 46:43.758
Maybe you and he can make love
and you could think of me.

46:45.569 --> 46:48.231
I'd just be happy
to be in there somewhere.

47:04.855 --> 47:06.447
Do you have a girlfriend?

47:06.523 --> 47:07.751
Does it matter?

47:07.824 --> 47:10.315
Well, I'd like to think
you were available.

47:10.660 --> 47:12.252
Oh, I'm available.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.232
Did you forget about my ass?

47:25.308 --> 47:27.776
No! No, I've been
thinking about it.

47:27.844 --> 47:30.039
She tattooed my name
on her ass.

47:30.113 --> 47:32.240
Not just my name,
a lot of names.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.040
And funny sayings, too.

47:34.117 --> 47:36.813
She's got one up there that
says, "Slippery when wet."

47:36.887 --> 47:38.115
How do you know that?

47:38.188 --> 47:40.122
What is she?
Some great piece of ass?

47:40.190 --> 47:41.987
She's no great piece of ass.

47:42.893 --> 47:44.087
I mean, uh...

47:44.161 --> 47:46.459
Hey, wait... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

47:46.530 --> 47:49.328
We're all adults here.
Let's reason this out.

47:49.399 --> 47:52.061
Now Marie is the type
of person that if you gotta...

47:52.135 --> 47:54.569
If this gash doesn't
get her buns out of here,

47:54.638 --> 47:56.970
I am gonna drive this bike
up her butt!

47:57.040 --> 47:59.008
While Patty
tends to be more direct.

47:59.142 --> 48:00.541
As for you, farm boy,

48:00.610 --> 48:01.804
(GRUNTS)

48:01.878 --> 48:03.038
we're married!

48:03.446 --> 48:05.380
And as for you, kewpie doll...

48:08.818 --> 48:10.115
You protected me!

48:10.187 --> 48:12.155
You must really like me.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.138
(WAVES BREAKING)

50:19.215 --> 50:21.706
I had the craziest
fantasy that I could

50:22.919 --> 50:23.943
rise up.

50:24.954 --> 50:28.287
Float right down
the end of this cornet.

50:29.426 --> 50:30.950
Right through here.

50:31.494 --> 50:32.825
Through these valves,

50:33.797 --> 50:35.697
right along this tube,

50:36.733 --> 50:38.860
come right up
against your lips,

50:39.803 --> 50:41.168
and give you a kiss.

50:44.674 --> 50:45.936
Why didn't you?

50:47.043 --> 50:49.238
I didn't want to get
spit on me.

51:32.322 --> 51:33.983

51:36.092 --> 51:38.458
(BOTH PANTING)

51:41.898 --> 51:43.729
Was it good for you, too?

51:47.704 --> 51:49.365
I really do want to kiss you.

51:52.041 --> 51:53.303
But I'm afraid.

51:54.377 --> 51:56.004
I would've kept my tongue in.

51:56.112 --> 51:57.545
No, I mean,

52:00.350 --> 52:02.318
I'm afraid if I kiss you,

52:04.354 --> 52:06.117
I'll fall in love with you.

52:07.590 --> 52:08.716
You will?

52:09.759 --> 52:11.556
And I don't want to.

52:12.829 --> 52:13.955
You don't?

52:15.965 --> 52:17.660
My mother sacrificed everything

52:17.734 --> 52:20.100
to send me through
cosmetology school.

52:20.570 --> 52:21.628
She did?

52:23.306 --> 52:25.934
She has this dream
for me to be something.

52:26.843 --> 52:27.867
She does?

52:29.646 --> 52:32.479
To marry someone with power,

52:33.516 --> 52:35.177
money, vision.

I've got one!

52:45.328 --> 52:47.387
I've got a special purpose!

52:47.464 --> 52:48.692
You do?

52:48.765 --> 52:50.858
(EXCLAIMING)
Yes, it's fantastic!

52:50.934 --> 52:53.801
It's great!
It's unbelievable!

52:54.304 --> 52:56.204
And I was afraid
to tell you about it!

52:56.272 --> 52:58.137
Your mother's gonna love me!

53:01.177 --> 53:03.270
Marie, are you awake?

53:05.415 --> 53:06.473
Good.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.846
You look so beautiful
and peaceful,

53:11.054 --> 53:12.919
you almost look dead.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.383
And I'm glad because

53:17.760 --> 53:20.354
there's something I wanna say
that's always been very difficult

53:20.430 --> 53:22.125
for me to say.

53:23.566 --> 53:25.193
I slit the sheet,
the sheet I slit,

53:25.268 --> 53:26.997
and on the slitted sheet I sit.

53:29.672 --> 53:31.264
I've never been relaxed enough

53:31.341 --> 53:33.571
around anyone
to be able to say that.

53:34.677 --> 53:36.736
You give me confidence
in myself.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.381
I know we've only known
each other

53:40.450 --> 53:42.418
for four weeks and three days,

53:42.886 --> 53:44.114
but to me

53:44.521 --> 53:46.955
it seems like
nine weeks and five days.

53:48.958 --> 53:51.085
The first day
seemed like a week.

53:52.228 --> 53:55.163
And the second day
seemed like five days.

53:56.299 --> 53:58.460
And the third day
seemed like a week again.

53:59.135 --> 54:02.070
And the fourth day
seemed like eight days.

54:03.106 --> 54:05.870
But the fifth day,
you went to see your mother.

54:06.543 --> 54:08.443
And that seemed
just like a day.

54:09.479 --> 54:12.141
But then you
came back and later

54:13.049 --> 54:15.950
on the sixth day, in the
evening, when we saw each other,

54:16.319 --> 54:19.652
that started seeming
like two days.

54:20.523 --> 54:21.956
So in the evening,
it seemed like

54:22.025 --> 54:24.255
two days spilling over
into the next day.

54:24.327 --> 54:26.386
And that started
seeming like four days.

54:26.496 --> 54:28.726
So at the end of the sixth day,

54:29.098 --> 54:32.534
on into the seventh day,
it seemed like a total of five days.

54:33.670 --> 54:36.867
And the sixth day seemed like

54:37.507 --> 54:39.134
a week and a half.

54:40.510 --> 54:41.670
I have it written down

54:41.744 --> 54:44.975
but I can... I can show it to you
tomorrow if you wanna see it.

54:46.049 --> 54:49.780
Anyway,
I've decided that tomorrow,

54:50.720 --> 54:52.278
when the time is right,

54:53.690 --> 54:55.317
I'm gonna ask you to marry me.

54:58.127 --> 54:59.822
If that's okay with you.

55:00.363 --> 55:02.331
Just don't say anything.
