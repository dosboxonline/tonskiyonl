And the autopsy says heart failure.

1:03:25.427 --> 1:03:30.473
But, if you go through

PRIME MINISTER: Premier,
I believe the present danger

1:22:43.167 --> 1:22:44.876
can be averted if we act swiftly.

1:23:23.415 --> 1:23:26.751
Now, Johnny, I want you to kill Xiang Ping.

1:24:09.586 --> 1:24:11.504
