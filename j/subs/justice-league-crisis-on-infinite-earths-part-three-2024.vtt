WEBVTT

00:16.616 --> 00:18.611
[dramatic music playing]

01:31.983 --> 01:33.620
[thudding]

01:33.620 --> 01:35.589
It's working. Keep it up!

01:36.328 --> 01:38.328
[lasers trilling]

01:42.499 --> 01:44.103
It's growing a shell!

01:47.438 --> 01:50.098
Worse. Armor.

01:50.098 --> 01:51.671
It's adapting again.

01:53.972 --> 01:55.972
[Kara screaming in effort]

01:57.041 --> 01:59.118
[grunts]

02:00.979 --> 02:02.979
[fire crackling]

02:06.622 --> 02:09.392
[Kara, voice trembling] No.
[gasps] What have I done?

02:10.857 --> 02:12.626
[Monitor groans]

02:14.300 --> 02:15.695
[moaning]

02:18.667 --> 02:20.667
[thudding]

02:24.343 --> 02:26.343
[energy warbling]

02:31.878 --> 02:33.878
[energy whirring]

02:46.057 --> 02:48.057
[whooshing]

02:51.832 --> 02:53.832
[dramatic music playing]

03:22.533 --> 03:24.159
[thudding]

03:24.159 --> 03:25.633
[Anti-Monitor] Now...

03:27.197 --> 03:29.032
Die...

03:31.377 --> 03:33.377
[energy warbling]

03:35.381 --> 03:37.381
[warbling stops]

04:21.955 --> 04:23.724
Anything?

04:23.724 --> 04:26.826
Not yet, Shayera.
But she's here somewhere.

04:26.826 --> 04:29.763
I'm still registering
no life signs, but ours.

04:29.763 --> 04:31.501
We've been at this for weeks.

04:31.501 --> 04:33.668
- I'm not giving up.
- [Hawkgirl] Neither am I.

04:33.668 --> 04:35.736
I'm just saying that
sifting through

04:35.736 --> 04:39.641
5.9 sextillion metric tons
of shattered planet is...

04:39.641 --> 04:41.775
- [radar trilling]
- Wait!

04:48.278 --> 04:49.321
I've got her!

04:50.819 --> 04:52.687
On my way.

04:52.687 --> 04:55.151
[Hawkgirl]
Hawkgirl to Satellite,
I found her!

05:03.062 --> 05:04.501
Over here.

05:05.867 --> 05:08.835
- Diana!
- [Lois] Is she...

05:12.511 --> 05:15.270
If she is, I've wasted
a lot of time out here.

05:15.270 --> 05:19.714
She's not dead. She can't be.
I don't think it's possible.

05:19.714 --> 05:21.144
Clark, your heat vision.

05:23.346 --> 05:25.357
[crackling]

05:31.354 --> 05:33.530
[Wonder Woman gasps]

05:36.766 --> 05:40.537
I can't believe it.
We've been searching for you
for eight months.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.574
Diana, thank God
you're all right!

05:46.270 --> 05:49.381
Thank the gods?
For this "gift"?

05:50.681 --> 05:54.881
A billion people
have died all around me.

05:54.881 --> 05:57.015
No one should have
to endure this.

05:59.184 --> 06:02.658
- [Diana sobs]
- Diana, I'm sorry.

06:02.658 --> 06:04.924
[Diana crying]

06:07.929 --> 06:11.194
What happened? Where are we?

06:12.362 --> 06:16.034
Buckle in. It's a long story.

06:18.973 --> 06:22.238
[Earth-2 Superman] Diana,
welcome to The Bleed.

06:22.238 --> 06:25.384
It's an unstable dimension
that exists
outside the Multiverse.

06:26.651 --> 06:28.651
Truly, neither here nor there.

06:30.655 --> 06:33.216
The Fields of Asphodel.

06:34.252 --> 06:37.561
Yeah, it's kind of a limbo.

06:37.561 --> 06:42.291
It's a lifeboat. One that's
sprung a lot of leaks.

06:42.291 --> 06:46.130
Here. We found
this the second week.
Not a scratch on it.

06:46.968 --> 06:49.133
It gave us hope.

06:49.133 --> 06:54.006
And hope, well,
that's something
we desperately need these days.

07:01.686 --> 07:03.686
[whooshing]

07:06.625 --> 07:09.923
I don't understand.
What's happened here?

07:09.923 --> 07:12.156
[Superman] The Bleed doesn't
obey the rules of physics,

07:12.156 --> 07:14.499
which allows it to exist
extra dimensionally,

07:14.499 --> 07:17.161
and thankfully, hidden
from the Anti-Monitor.

07:17.161 --> 07:19.097
The thing
that's trying to kill us.

07:19.097 --> 07:20.637
- [people speaking indistinctly]
- Unfortunately, it also throws

07:20.637 --> 07:23.101
a ton of other laws
out the window as well.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.510
It's not exactly stable.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.941
Space and time collide here.

07:27.941 --> 07:31.175
Each Earth's past and present
are constantly in flux.

07:31.175 --> 07:33.947
[Superman] There aren't really
enough resources to go around.

07:33.947 --> 07:36.521
Many Earths
are totally inaccessible.

07:36.521 --> 07:40.382
Natural disasters are so common
it's big news when
one's not happening.

07:44.322 --> 07:46.025
This seems unsustainable.

07:47.699 --> 07:49.501
What do we do next?

07:49.501 --> 07:52.262
That is the question.

07:52.262 --> 07:54.099
Good to have you back,
Wonder Woman.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.969
Welcome home, Diana.

07:55.969 --> 07:57.267
[man over intercom] <i>Aquaman?
Aquaman can you hear us?</i>

07:57.267 --> 07:58.334
You'll have to excuse me.

07:58.334 --> 08:00.039
[man] <i>We're being overrun!</i>

08:00.039 --> 08:02.712
We're providing water
to every Earth that needs it.

08:02.712 --> 08:04.615
- [man] <i>We don't have enough...</i>
- You'll have to ration.

08:04.615 --> 08:07.651
Our world can only give so much
before ecological disaster.

08:07.651 --> 08:10.621
Look, there may come a time
when we can once again

08:10.621 --> 08:13.481
be able to supply you
with what you need.
But it is not this time.

08:13.481 --> 08:15.219
[man] <i>How are we supposed
to hold out? Millions will die.</i>

08:15.219 --> 08:18.024
I understand
the issues at stake.

08:18.024 --> 08:19.828
Please be considerate.

08:19.828 --> 08:21.896
There are many people that
need this just as much as you.

08:21.896 --> 08:23.667
[Mr. Terrific] We missed you,
Diana.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.065
You were right, Michael.

08:26.065 --> 08:30.905
Again. This netherverse
of The Bleed saved us.

08:30.905 --> 08:32.467
I suppose it's
a perfect example

08:32.467 --> 08:35.910
of be careful
what you wish for.

08:35.910 --> 08:38.583
You said this would take
incalculable power.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.080
- How did you...?
- I didn't.

08:41.080 --> 08:45.755
The Monitor had billions
of years' worth of cosmic
energy stored inside his cells.

08:45.755 --> 08:49.660
- When he died, he released that
energy to the Towers and he...
- [Wonder Woman] Died?

08:49.660 --> 08:53.928
How? I thought he was like me.

08:53.928 --> 08:55.831
[Doctor Light] Immortal?

08:55.831 --> 08:57.360
Well, turns out
"Can't die" isn't quite
the same as

08:57.360 --> 09:01.232
"Can't get totally obliterated
by Supergirl."

09:01.232 --> 09:03.399
Dr. Hoshi!

09:03.399 --> 09:06.578
Whoops. So who knew
she was here?

09:06.578 --> 09:08.239
She hardly says a thing.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.617
[suspenseful music playing]

09:18.383 --> 09:20.383
[indistinct chattering]

09:25.588 --> 09:29.029
- [Superman] Ah, Miss Lane.
- Come on, Clark.

09:29.029 --> 09:30.932
At this point, everybody knows.

09:33.431 --> 09:35.937
Welcome back, Diana.

09:35.937 --> 09:38.104
It's good to see you, Dinah.

09:38.104 --> 09:41.008
You're every bit
the Black Canary
your mother was.

09:43.815 --> 09:46.618
You're Dinah Drake's daughter?

09:46.618 --> 09:50.083
- Oliver Queen.
- [chuckles] I know.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.118
[growling in distance]

09:54.254 --> 09:57.420
A good story. That's why
I followed these guys.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.158
It could be literally anything.

10:11.469 --> 10:13.469
[snarling]

10:19.785 --> 10:21.785
[dinosaurs roaring]

10:29.652 --> 10:32.356
[people screaming]

10:32.356 --> 10:35.161
"Dinosaurs Stampede
In Downtown Metropolis."

10:35.161 --> 10:37.460
This is Perry White's
ultimate dream headline.

10:38.661 --> 10:41.530
[man screaming]

10:41.530 --> 10:43.807
I'll take care
of the Pterodactyls.

10:43.807 --> 10:46.744
- Will you be all right?
- Pretty sure they're
Pteranodons. I'll be fine.

10:48.341 --> 10:51.342
- [dinosaurs roaring]
- [people screaming]

10:52.576 --> 10:53.575
[man yells]

10:54.677 --> 10:55.885
[screams and thuds]

10:57.350 --> 10:59.647
- [man screams]
- [dinosaur roars]

10:59.647 --> 11:01.319
- [man screams]
- [Black Canary grunts]

11:02.586 --> 11:04.223
[dinosaur roars]

11:06.865 --> 11:09.129
[electrical buzzing]

11:09.129 --> 11:11.197
[dinosaur grunts, thuds]

11:12.035 --> 11:14.068
[thuds]

11:14.068 --> 11:16.499
I'm not totally sure
we should even save
these uptown fat cats.

11:16.499 --> 11:18.270
They've kind of
got this coming to them.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.746
Is "fat cats"
an Earth-1 expression?

11:21.746 --> 11:23.913
And aren't you a millionaire?

11:23.913 --> 11:27.081
Oh, no. I'm a billionaire.
Actually.

11:27.081 --> 11:29.721
[dinosaur snarling]

11:29.721 --> 11:32.119
[Black Canary screaming
in high pitched tone]

11:36.125 --> 11:37.520
Wow. Not bad.

11:45.728 --> 11:47.695
- Slow down, big fella. Let's...
- [Pterodactyl screeching]

11:47.695 --> 11:49.103
[Superman groaning]

11:52.141 --> 11:53.943
- [Pterodactyls screeching]
- [people screaming]

11:53.943 --> 11:55.604
[dinosaur roaring]

11:55.604 --> 11:58.211
[Wonder Woman grunts]
Run! Quickly!

11:58.211 --> 12:00.246
[dinosaur roaring]

12:01.117 --> 12:02.985
[Wonder Woman groans]

12:09.290 --> 12:10.553
[woman screaming]

12:13.558 --> 12:15.261
[dinosaur roars]

12:15.261 --> 12:16.999
[woman screaming]

12:18.233 --> 12:19.804
[crying]

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
[dinosaur growling]

12:24.976 --> 12:26.701
- [dinosaur roars]
- [metal clanking]

12:26.701 --> 12:29.407
Here's a noseful of
Metropolis, just for you!

12:31.180 --> 12:33.279
Lois, no, I've got this!

12:33.279 --> 12:35.820
Really? 'Cause it sort of looks
like... [gasps]

12:40.024 --> 12:40.858
[thuds]

12:48.428 --> 12:50.692
Oh! You do got this.

12:52.696 --> 12:55.466
You knew you could
talk to that thing?

12:55.466 --> 12:57.809
Well, I hoped.

12:57.809 --> 12:59.811
[dinosaur screeching
and roaring]

12:59.811 --> 13:02.011
[people screaming]

13:10.648 --> 13:12.956
[Pterodactyls screeching]

13:12.956 --> 13:14.892
- [Superman grunting]
- [Earth-2 Superman]
Hang on, Superman!

13:15.719 --> 13:17.653
[laser whooshing]

13:24.200 --> 13:26.365
[people yelling]

13:26.365 --> 13:28.400
- [dinosaur roars]
- [Wonder Woman grunts]

13:31.735 --> 13:33.911
[metallic thudding]

13:35.343 --> 13:37.343
[Wonder Woman] Whoa! [grunts]

13:41.679 --> 13:44.812
- Whoa, girl! Easy now.
- [Dinosaur growling quietly]

13:44.812 --> 13:46.055
Easy.

13:48.818 --> 13:50.356
[dinosaur growling softly]

13:50.356 --> 13:51.830
[people screaming]

13:54.560 --> 13:56.329
[both screaming]

13:58.498 --> 13:59.728
[electrical buzzing]

14:03.668 --> 14:05.371
[dinosaur thuds, screeches]

14:05.371 --> 14:07.505
Well, that's the last of them.

14:07.505 --> 14:10.541
Uh, hey, how about
we go for coffee?

14:10.541 --> 14:13.082
Don't pat yourself on the back
too hard, Robin Hood.

14:13.082 --> 14:14.886
I don't think
it's quite over yet.

14:14.886 --> 14:16.954
[high-pitched scream]

14:22.885 --> 14:23.862
Great Scott!

14:25.888 --> 14:28.130
This is what I get
for asking for action.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.936
Wait! Listen.

14:31.936 --> 14:34.972
[distant aircraft
propellers whirring]

14:37.405 --> 14:39.438
[roaring]

14:43.873 --> 14:44.949
[firing]

14:49.879 --> 14:51.648
[engine revs]

14:54.917 --> 14:56.928
[machine gun shooting]

15:02.331 --> 15:04.001
[explodes]

15:10.933 --> 15:12.669
[tires screeching]

15:16.345 --> 15:18.708
You best watch
where you're standing, ma'am.

15:18.708 --> 15:21.051
A road's a dangerous place.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.647
Yeah. The dinosaurs
are kind of a hazard.

15:23.647 --> 15:25.990
I'm actually more interested
in your story.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.454
I'm Lois Lane from <i>The Planet.</i>

15:28.454 --> 15:30.291
Not much of a story, Miss Lane.

15:30.291 --> 15:33.261
We're just a motley collection
of grunts lost in time,

15:33.261 --> 15:38.332
trying to keep that pack
of ugly lizards
from hurting anyone.

15:38.332 --> 15:42.006
I've covered a lot of
strange stories over
the last eight months--

15:42.006 --> 15:44.041
[machine gun shooting]

15:45.539 --> 15:48.342
Sorry. That's our cue.

15:48.342 --> 15:51.444
- [tires screeching]
- [Lois] Wait, Who are you?
[coughing]

15:51.444 --> 15:54.953
Nobody important, ma'am.
We're just a bunch of losers.

15:56.319 --> 15:57.549
[engine revving]

16:12.302 --> 16:13.796
[machine gun shooting]

16:13.796 --> 16:15.402
- [dinosaurs roaring]
- [tires screeching]

16:34.720 --> 16:36.687
[Joker cackles]

16:36.687 --> 16:41.329
My favorite dinosaur
was the one
with the huge vocabulary.

16:41.329 --> 16:42.858
[Two-Face] Which one?

16:42.858 --> 16:47.863
The Thesaurus.
[laughing maniacally]

16:47.863 --> 16:50.899
[Lex laughs,
inhales sharply] Nice.

16:50.899 --> 16:53.374
It's funny
because you walk right into it.

16:53.374 --> 16:54.705
How many deaths?

16:54.705 --> 16:57.675
None. Can you believe it?

16:57.675 --> 17:00.678
A total filler episode. Ugh!

17:01.285 --> 17:03.417
[Ivy] Le--

17:03.417 --> 17:05.518
Supreme Leader...
[clears throat]

17:05.518 --> 17:08.191
We have our own
chronal anomaly.

17:08.191 --> 17:11.161
Mount Vesuvius
just phased into Central City.

17:11.161 --> 17:12.591
And it's erupting.

17:15.101 --> 17:18.531
Well, what do you
expect me to do about it?

17:18.531 --> 17:21.897
Ooh! I'll make popcorn!
[cackles]

17:21.897 --> 17:24.834
If those civilians
are too stupid to flee
in the face of that,

17:24.834 --> 17:26.242
they don't deserve to live.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.475
That's Darwinism
in its purest form.

17:30.072 --> 17:32.578
I don't expect you
to do anything.

17:32.578 --> 17:34.712
But you should know
the frequency
of these anomalies

17:34.712 --> 17:36.417
is increasing geometrically.

17:37.717 --> 17:39.552
I think you mean exponentially.

17:39.552 --> 17:42.786
We have to face the fact
that we can't continue

17:42.786 --> 17:45.591
in this freakish
Bleed indefinitely.

17:45.591 --> 17:49.298
It's a death sentence
for all life on every Earth.

17:50.268 --> 17:52.862
Oh, the poor plants.

17:52.862 --> 17:55.931
Just thinking about all
that withering wisteria

17:55.931 --> 17:58.967
makes you green in the face,
don't it, Ivy?

17:58.967 --> 18:00.606
[pretending to choke]

18:04.480 --> 18:09.450
Come now, let's not bicker
and argue in the face
of universal annihilation.

18:09.450 --> 18:12.948
It should surprise
none of you that I have
an ace up my sleeve.

18:12.948 --> 18:15.786
It's a card that,
if played correctly,

18:17.823 --> 18:19.262
could save us all.

18:22.795 --> 18:27.666
Oh, do you mean us all?
Or <i>us</i> all?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.669
Do you really care?

18:34.004 --> 18:35.311
Eh...

18:42.848 --> 18:43.880
Open it.

18:54.629 --> 18:55.727
Zap him.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.402
- [electrical buzzing]
- [prisoner cries in agony]

19:05.970 --> 19:08.707
Once more.
Better safe than sorry, right?

19:10.810 --> 19:12.546
- [electrical buzzing]
- [prisoner cries in agony]

19:20.083 --> 19:22.017
No shenanigans.

19:22.017 --> 19:24.228
I like to think
you'd know better by now.

19:24.228 --> 19:26.263
[prisoner moans and whimpers]

19:28.663 --> 19:30.300
Atta boy.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.336
Now you've been enjoying
our hospitality for some time.

19:33.336 --> 19:37.032
One square meal a day,
nice cot, firm mattress.

19:37.032 --> 19:39.606
- [prisoner whimpers]
- Constant companionship.

19:41.709 --> 19:44.875
You're probably wondering
what you can do to repay me.

19:44.875 --> 19:48.252
Well, you have a friend
I'd like to talk to.

19:48.252 --> 19:50.650
I need you to call him for me.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.047
[Psycho Pirate whimpers]

19:53.391 --> 19:55.985
It's a long-distance call.

19:55.985 --> 19:58.625
[Psycho Pirate whimpers]

20:02.697 --> 20:05.698
Commissioner Montoya
just assumed
they were coming here.

20:05.698 --> 20:06.897
She might have been wrong.

20:07.966 --> 20:10.340
She's not.

20:10.340 --> 20:14.003
The Gotham City Armory is their
surest bet to get
the modern weaponry they need.

20:14.003 --> 20:17.039
Maybe they made another stop
on the way here.

20:17.039 --> 20:20.075
You think they made
a coffee run?

20:20.075 --> 20:22.880
The time anomaly appeared
on the south end
of Robinson Park.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.717
Where would they stop? Think!

20:25.984 --> 20:27.951
[Robin] Police headquarters.

20:27.951 --> 20:30.459
They could raid the lock-up,
evidence lockers.

20:30.459 --> 20:33.561
If they did, they'd get
their hands on every
confiscated weapon of--

20:33.561 --> 20:35.090
- [grunts]
- [crashing]

20:36.731 --> 20:37.895
Here they come.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.577
Great. An army
of vicious Nazi killers

20:49.577 --> 20:51.579
armed with the Rogue's
deadliest weapons.

21:01.118 --> 21:03.558
[soldier gasps and grunts]

21:03.558 --> 21:04.988
[electrical buzzing]

21:06.695 --> 21:07.958
[soldier grunts]

21:09.027 --> 21:10.598
- [both grunting]
- [thuds]

21:12.030 --> 21:13.304
[soldier grunts]

21:14.340 --> 21:16.065
[Huntress] Argh!

21:16.065 --> 21:17.341
What even is this?

21:21.842 --> 21:22.973
[soldier grunts]

21:24.614 --> 21:25.712
[Robin grunts]

21:27.012 --> 21:28.814
[both grunting]

21:30.015 --> 21:31.355
[hissing]

21:34.283 --> 21:37.251
[thudding, grunting]

21:37.251 --> 21:39.627
- [electrical buzzing]
- [soldier crying of agony]

21:45.635 --> 21:48.471
[explodes]

21:48.471 --> 21:51.672
- [Robin grunts]
- [all grunting]

21:55.073 --> 21:57.315
Don't freak out, Bats.
They're still alive.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.075
More or less.

22:06.249 --> 22:08.249
[people screaming]

22:16.061 --> 22:18.325
[speaking German]

22:18.325 --> 22:20.162
- [gas hissing]
- [Batman groans]

22:27.171 --> 22:29.347
[growling]

22:30.273 --> 22:31.415
[Batman groans]

22:32.517 --> 22:35.078
[grunting and groaning]

22:48.962 --> 22:52.436
It's... It's you, isn't it?

22:52.436 --> 22:54.064
[Barbarian Bat] Barry?

22:54.064 --> 22:55.868
Go back
to the beginning, Bruce.

22:55.868 --> 22:59.135
To before the beginning.
You must. It's the only way.

22:59.808 --> 23:01.302
No, don't!

23:08.652 --> 23:10.652
[Batman panting, grunting]

23:13.316 --> 23:16.724
Earth-2 to Satellite.
Emergency trans-mat.
I have an injured Batman.

23:16.724 --> 23:18.759
He was exposed
to Scarecrow's fear toxin.

23:19.993 --> 23:22.697
[Batman panting]

23:22.697 --> 23:24.391
Satellite, what the hell
is wrong with you?

23:24.391 --> 23:26.195
We have a medical emergency!

23:26.195 --> 23:27.636
[Mr. Terrific over intercom]
<i>Sorry, Earth-2,</i>

23:27.636 --> 23:29.605
<i>we have a developing
situation here.</i>

23:29.605 --> 23:31.805
<i>Prepare Batman
for emergency trans-mat.</i>

23:33.677 --> 23:35.138
[Huntress] He'll be okay.

23:35.138 --> 23:36.447
Will any of us?

23:48.285 --> 23:50.428
[Batgirl] Wow.
Then what happened?

23:51.794 --> 23:54.124
[Kara] We were together
from then on.

23:54.124 --> 23:56.764
The other Legionaries
got to see another side of him.

23:57.701 --> 23:59.767
The Brainy I knew.

23:59.767 --> 24:03.771
[chuckling] Well, that was
one hell of a first date,
that's for sure.

24:03.771 --> 24:05.300
I know what
you're trying to do.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.435
I'm trying not to eat
these doughnuts,

24:08.435 --> 24:10.811
because holy
empty calories, right?

24:10.811 --> 24:12.747
I know, Babs.

24:12.747 --> 24:16.410
I'm a complete wreck and you're
trying to make things normal.

24:16.410 --> 24:18.555
To make me feel like it's not
the end of the universe.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.557
Only...

24:21.483 --> 24:22.790
It probably is.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.355
And it's my fault.

24:27.355 --> 24:30.193
And there's
nothing I can do about it.

24:30.193 --> 24:33.504
It is not. When are you gonna
get that through your head?

24:33.504 --> 24:35.506
- Even if the Monitor
was still here...
- [alarm blaring]

24:35.506 --> 24:37.706
...there's no guarantee that--

24:37.706 --> 24:40.269
Okay. It's that time again.

24:40.269 --> 24:43.844
[whooshing]

24:43.844 --> 24:46.517
Reading quantum energy spikes
so high they're off the charts.

24:46.517 --> 24:49.553
I've got Earths calling in,
like all of them.

24:49.553 --> 24:51.379
They wanna know
what's going on.

24:51.379 --> 24:54.624
Probably less important here,
but someone is materializing

24:54.624 --> 24:57.220
on the trans-mat platform
without proper authorization.

25:02.095 --> 25:05.800
- What the hell
is going on here, Michael?
- [Mr. Terrific] Luthor!

25:05.800 --> 25:10.299
The top science minds
on Earth-10 tell me The Bleed
is tearing itself apart.

25:10.299 --> 25:13.302
Aren't you the top science mind
on Earth-10?

25:13.302 --> 25:16.404
Yes. Which is why I came.

25:16.404 --> 25:21.475
The Monitor's technology
is a bit beyond most of you.

25:21.475 --> 25:24.346
Despite appearances, The Bleed
is mostly holding together.

25:24.346 --> 25:27.349
Wrong. It's buckling here.

25:27.349 --> 25:29.186
The fabric of The Bleed.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.089
Ripping.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.454
Which Earth is that?

25:35.095 --> 25:38.360
Earth... Earth-146.

25:46.403 --> 25:49.371
Mera.
<i>- Hello, my love.</i>

25:49.371 --> 25:51.109
<i>We can see it now.</i>

25:51.109 --> 25:53.881
<i>Forming in the sky above us.
It's massive.</i>

25:55.214 --> 25:56.411
<i>I'll show you.</i>

25:58.415 --> 25:59.414
[whooshing]

26:03.629 --> 26:06.058
[Mera] <i>I will send telemetry
to that last moment.</i>

26:07.633 --> 26:08.929
<i>I pray it helps you.</i>

26:12.429 --> 26:15.265
<i>It's releasing
some kind of energy.</i>

26:15.265 --> 26:18.741
<i>Like the waves.
It's antimatter.</i>

26:18.741 --> 26:19.973
Oh, god.

26:25.079 --> 26:26.309
It's not over yet.

26:26.309 --> 26:28.916
Arthur, contact
all patrol ships.

26:28.916 --> 26:30.621
All metas with space
capabilities.

26:30.621 --> 26:32.315
Get them positioned between--

26:32.315 --> 26:34.317
It's too late, Michael. They'll
never get there in time.

26:34.317 --> 26:35.626
And even if they could...

26:35.626 --> 26:36.825
Arthur--

26:40.666 --> 26:42.160
Send me home.

27:00.477 --> 27:03.115
Arthur. No. Don't do it.

27:04.448 --> 27:07.218
They're my people. My family.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.452
[dramatic music playing]

27:20.464 --> 27:22.464
[dramatic music continues]

27:39.186 --> 27:41.186
[whooshing]

27:49.361 --> 27:50.426
[Kara gasps]

28:03.045 --> 28:04.748
[digital beeping]

28:04.748 --> 28:07.014
Barry! Ugh.

28:07.918 --> 28:09.115
[grunts]

28:41.644 --> 28:43.886
Ah, Mr. Wayne.

28:43.886 --> 28:46.086
Good to see you up
and on your feet again.

28:49.223 --> 28:51.553
Don't take it too hard.

28:51.553 --> 28:54.798
Unfortunately, you have
the one doctor in The Bleed
who can see in the dark.

28:59.134 --> 29:02.630
Dr. Elizabeth Chapel.
Doctor Midnight?

29:04.733 --> 29:08.746
Mm, retired.
Right now we need doctors
more than we need capes.

29:10.277 --> 29:11.507
I'm on the Satellite.

29:13.247 --> 29:15.786
From my nail growth,
I'd estimate eight days.

29:16.481 --> 29:18.514
Ten. Nice trick.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.319
How's your head?

29:21.319 --> 29:24.256
You came in with enough
fear toxin to kill an elephant.

29:24.256 --> 29:26.555
Something's wrong here.

29:26.555 --> 29:28.095
You're not just
physically exhausted.

29:28.095 --> 29:31.395
You're traumatized, grieving.

29:31.395 --> 29:34.035
There's considerably
more plasma orbiting the sun.

29:34.873 --> 29:35.872
What happened?

29:37.040 --> 29:40.107
The Anti-Monitor found us.

29:40.107 --> 29:43.913
Somehow ripped
its way into The Bleed.

29:43.913 --> 29:46.883
Just long enough
to destroy Earth-146.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.953
Arthur's world. Did he...?

29:50.953 --> 29:52.647
[Dr. Beth Chapel] He's gone.

29:52.647 --> 29:54.649
Two days later,
it happened again.

29:54.649 --> 29:59.753
Earth-88.
Yesterday, Earth-2112.

29:59.753 --> 30:02.558
A flash of antimatter,
then everything,

30:03.528 --> 30:05.869
and everyone, dead.

30:07.697 --> 30:10.764
The Flash. I knew he was dead

30:10.764 --> 30:14.603
before I already knew
because I... I saw him die.

30:14.603 --> 30:16.638
Back on Warworld,
I saw Flash die.

30:16.638 --> 30:20.609
Mr. Wayne, the toxin.
You were hallucinating.

30:20.609 --> 30:24.382
I know what I saw.
I need to talk to a doctor.

30:25.418 --> 30:27.924
Oh. You want a second opinion?

30:29.026 --> 30:30.520
He's not that kind of doctor.

30:32.590 --> 30:36.526
[Doctor Fate] What is it
you seek from Doctor Fate,
Batman?

30:36.526 --> 30:40.871
You're the last doctor
in the Multiverse
who makes house calls, Nelson.

30:40.871 --> 30:44.908
Dad, I mean, Bruce,
you should be resting.

30:44.908 --> 30:48.175
Between the fear toxin
and the bullets...

30:48.175 --> 30:51.376
All of you, listen.
When I was on Warworld

30:51.376 --> 30:56.216
a dying old man appeared
from nowhere to give
me a message.

30:56.216 --> 30:59.923
I didn't know it until now,
but it was The Flash.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.724
Why would he be old?

31:09.724 --> 31:12.936
How would Barry
even have gotten to Warworld?

31:12.936 --> 31:16.005
We all wish we could find
Barry and Iris.

31:16.005 --> 31:20.438
But even if you did see him,
why does it matter?

31:20.438 --> 31:24.838
Because I think he traveled
back in time from this crisis.

31:24.838 --> 31:28.116
Not just to warn us.
But to help.

31:28.116 --> 31:30.745
Tell us something significant.

31:30.745 --> 31:34.925
Bruce, we were
trapped in a world
of automatons and illusions.

31:34.925 --> 31:37.257
How can you know
if what you saw was real?

31:38.392 --> 31:39.897
I called a specialist.

31:41.296 --> 31:48.136
[Doctor Fate speaking Latin]

31:49.898 --> 31:51.601
[whooshing]

32:08.752 --> 32:10.323
[Doctor Fate grunting]

32:13.097 --> 32:14.591
Are you all right, Doctor?

32:14.591 --> 32:20.498
[Doctor Fate] Yes. It was
a very significant event.

32:20.498 --> 32:21.829
And quite real.

32:23.503 --> 32:28.242
Your instincts are correct.
It was Barry.

32:28.242 --> 32:33.775
He was trying to give you
the answer to... all this.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.284
Before the beginning.

32:40.058 --> 32:43.521
[Doctor Fate] The answer lies
before the beginning.

32:43.521 --> 32:47.360
Before the Multiverse
even existed.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.693
[Robin] Then it's hopeless.
Time travel is impossible now.

32:50.693 --> 32:54.499
- There's no way to find out
how this all started
- Or how to fix it.

32:54.499 --> 32:57.436
- But there must be some way.
- [John Stewart chuckles]

32:57.436 --> 32:59.702
- What is it, John?
- Nothing.

32:59.702 --> 33:02.771
Well, there was this guy.
Homeless.

33:02.771 --> 33:05.906
He said a lot of crazy stuff.
He was a sorcerer.

33:08.053 --> 33:11.780
No offence. Anyway,
when the Shadows attacked,

33:11.780 --> 33:14.222
it turned out everything
he said was true.

33:14.222 --> 33:16.191
He magicked the hell
out of those things.

33:17.359 --> 33:19.227
Go on.

33:19.227 --> 33:21.988
He said he'd been tortured
in hell basically,

33:21.988 --> 33:24.892
since before
this universe even began.

33:24.892 --> 33:28.236
He said his name
was John Constantine.

33:28.236 --> 33:30.304
Does that name mean
anything to you?

33:30.304 --> 33:33.538
[Doctor Fate] I'm not sure,

33:33.538 --> 33:37.509
but I've just felt the helmet
of Nabu grow cold.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.512
Where is he now?

33:40.512 --> 33:42.646
He took off after
we entered The Bleed.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.846
Said he intended
to crawl into a hole,

33:44.846 --> 33:47.651
couldn't bear to watch
everything come
to an end again.

33:47.651 --> 33:50.016
He could be anywhere,
on any Earth.

33:50.016 --> 33:51.985
Needle in a haystack.

33:51.985 --> 33:54.064
Are you forgetting something?

33:54.064 --> 33:56.825
Does the "World's Greatest
Detective" ring a bell?

33:56.825 --> 33:58.596
We'll track this guy
down in no time.

34:01.062 --> 34:03.733
Tell me everything you remember
about this Constantine.

34:05.143 --> 34:07.638
Everything he did,
everything he said.

34:08.641 --> 34:10.080
He said...

34:10.080 --> 34:13.611
Well, he said he needed
a bloody drink.

34:19.454 --> 34:21.421
- [indistinct chattering]
- [piano music playing]

34:40.145 --> 34:41.243
[Constantine sighs]

34:44.248 --> 34:48.074
[groans] Sorry, mate.

34:48.074 --> 34:52.650
Spot me for another
shot of the coffin varnish, eh?

34:52.650 --> 34:56.324
Paint your tonsils on someone
else's nickel, rummy.

34:56.324 --> 34:57.886
It's not charity.

34:57.886 --> 35:01.824
I'm gonna entertain you
with what we call

35:01.824 --> 35:05.795
close-up magic.

35:05.795 --> 35:07.830
[lively piano music playing]

35:29.227 --> 35:31.491
Hmm, that's not bad, actually.

35:31.491 --> 35:34.054
[grunts and sighs]

35:38.533 --> 35:40.137
- [coin splashes]
- [crowd exclaims]

35:45.672 --> 35:47.210
[Constantine] Ugh.

35:47.210 --> 35:48.838
- [yelps]
- [crowd exclaims]

35:48.838 --> 35:50.004
[sighs]

36:08.662 --> 36:10.332
How did you...?

36:10.332 --> 36:11.993
[Batman] The saloon combined
the strongest levels

36:11.993 --> 36:15.799
of eldritch energy
with the highest
alcohol content.

36:15.799 --> 36:19.539
- Hey, fellas, here's a--
- Better end
that sentence carefully.

36:23.171 --> 36:24.742
[mug thuds on counter]

36:24.742 --> 36:27.008
Look what we got here, boys.

36:27.008 --> 36:29.186
Looks like the circus
come to town.

36:37.295 --> 36:40.362
Gentlemen, we're just here
to talk with that man.

36:40.362 --> 36:45.092
We don't want any trouble.
Most of us.

36:45.092 --> 36:47.336
Lady, we're sick
and tired of pirates,

36:47.336 --> 36:49.866
pilgrims and cavemen
wandering in here.

36:49.866 --> 36:51.769
This is our world.

36:51.769 --> 36:53.903
And we aim to keep it that way.

36:56.138 --> 36:58.138
[suspenseful music playing]

37:14.893 --> 37:17.333
[Doctor Fate] Let's all
settle down.

37:24.265 --> 37:25.638
Drinks are on me.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.410
Show off!

37:30.106 --> 37:31.743
- That's all I can take.
- [glass breaking]

37:31.743 --> 37:33.283
Get 'em boys!

37:33.283 --> 37:34.944
[man grunting, groaning]

37:36.981 --> 37:38.981
[all grunting]

37:42.459 --> 37:44.184
[coin jingles]

37:52.931 --> 37:54.634
[Sidewinder groans]

37:55.802 --> 37:58.033
- [gunshots]
- [swooshing]

38:04.206 --> 38:07.779
What in hell is going on here?

38:07.779 --> 38:11.915
I step out for five minutes
and you turn my saloon
into a rodeo?

38:11.915 --> 38:13.114
Bat Lash?

38:17.186 --> 38:19.329
- Do I know you, ma'am?
- [rifle cocks]

38:19.329 --> 38:22.497
Think I'd remember meeting you.

38:22.497 --> 38:29.031
I... met, uh,
a descendant of yours
on another world.

38:30.672 --> 38:32.474
He died in my arms.

38:35.336 --> 38:37.875
Lucky fella.

38:37.875 --> 38:40.812
A few months ago, I'da thought
that was a telltale.

38:40.812 --> 38:44.948
- Now? Plum normal.
- [Constantine glugging]

38:44.948 --> 38:48.754
- Clear the bar.
- Well, I don't see why I--

38:50.692 --> 38:53.891
Everybody out!
Closed for business!

38:53.891 --> 38:57.257
- [indistinct chattering]
- [Constantine glugging]

39:02.066 --> 39:05.540
Ugh, whoa! Getting rough!

39:05.540 --> 39:08.510
[cackles] Someone's up
for a trade.

39:10.338 --> 39:13.240
Do you have some kind
of special spell
to sober him up?

39:23.054 --> 39:24.526
Uh, agh!

39:25.287 --> 39:28.189
Ah, Nabu.

39:28.189 --> 39:35.064
I haven't seen you
in an eternity. [cackles]

39:37.706 --> 39:40.168
[Doctor Fate] I've never
seen him before.

39:40.168 --> 39:43.006
But he's impossibly old.

39:43.006 --> 39:46.339
Older than
the Multiverse itself.

39:46.339 --> 39:48.946
[Wonder Woman] How is that
even possible?

39:48.946 --> 39:52.587
I only just remember my name.

39:52.587 --> 39:58.186
Memory's like Swiss cheese,
it's mostly, uh, holes.

39:58.186 --> 40:01.728
In my experience, there are
ways to get people to remember.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.765
Many ways.

40:05.765 --> 40:08.163
Looks like I've gone
deep Barney.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.370
[thundering]

40:17.370 --> 40:19.581
[people screaming]

40:21.112 --> 40:23.079
[exploding]

40:23.079 --> 40:26.489
[cracking]

40:26.489 --> 40:28.854
- [man grunts]
- [woman screams, grunts]

40:30.154 --> 40:31.527
[cracking]

40:39.130 --> 40:41.328
[Original Black Canary
screaming in high-pitched tone]

40:43.167 --> 40:44.936
[man grunting]

40:49.679 --> 40:52.680
[sighs] It's nuts out here.
Jay, report.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.583
Earthquakes are not
letting up, Dinah.

40:54.583 --> 40:55.650
It's the worst one yet.

41:00.789 --> 41:02.459
[boy chuckles] Mom!

41:04.155 --> 41:08.421
[Hourman grunts in effort]

41:08.421 --> 41:11.259
[Original Black Canary sighs]
I'm getting reports
from all over.

41:11.259 --> 41:12.865
The whole world is shaking.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.805
- [thuds]
- [crashing]

41:24.549 --> 41:27.880
[growling]

41:27.880 --> 41:29.409
[Garrick] What's
causing all this?

41:30.753 --> 41:32.379
Best guess? That!

41:35.989 --> 41:37.791
Oh, shit.

41:37.791 --> 41:39.991
Earth-2 to Satellite. Come in.

41:39.991 --> 41:43.324
- [alarm blaring]
- [Mr. Terrific] We are aware
of your situation, Dinah.

41:43.324 --> 41:45.700
Our defenses have
already been deployed.

41:53.039 --> 41:54.511
[whooshing]

42:09.220 --> 42:11.627
[sinister music playing]

42:23.201 --> 42:25.872
- What can we do?
- Dinah.

42:27.238 --> 42:31.273
- Mom?
- I love you.

42:31.273 --> 42:32.912
[over intercom]
<i>And I'm proud of you.</i>

42:34.476 --> 42:36.476
[energy whooshing]

42:56.498 --> 42:58.564
[somber music playing]

42:58.564 --> 43:00.610
[Black Canary sobs] Mom.

43:09.654 --> 43:12.281
[Mr. Terrific] Chronal energy
is dropping to nominal.

43:12.281 --> 43:14.085
The fissure is sealed.

43:14.085 --> 43:18.188
That is terrific. Any guess on
when the next one arrives?

43:19.092 --> 43:20.256
Wrong W.

43:21.127 --> 43:23.292
Not "when" but "why"?

43:23.292 --> 43:26.163
Why was that thing
suddenly able to locate us

43:26.163 --> 43:28.737
in all this
limitless Multiverse?

43:28.737 --> 43:31.674
[The Question]
Excellent question.
Which leads to another.

43:34.437 --> 43:38.604
Did someone inside The Bleed
leak the information?

43:38.604 --> 43:40.947
Are you suggesting that
someone actually wanted

43:40.947 --> 43:44.214
to contact the Anti-Monitor?
To sell us out?

43:46.218 --> 43:48.284
[Lex] I don't even
have to turn around

43:48.284 --> 43:51.617
to feel Miss Lane's
eyeballs glaring at me.

43:51.617 --> 43:53.520
Lex, if I'm not mistaken,

43:53.520 --> 43:57.832
you arrived here just moments
before Earth-146 was destroyed.

43:57.832 --> 44:02.100
Not your hologram,
you came here. Physically.

44:02.100 --> 44:05.103
Are you seriously
accusing me of somehow

44:05.103 --> 44:09.371
contacting the Anti-Monitor
revealing the location
of The Bleed?

44:13.509 --> 44:17.951
Good. I was afraid
you were losing
your journalistic instincts.

44:17.951 --> 44:20.151
Yes, of course I did.

44:25.587 --> 44:27.587
[energy trilling]

44:55.188 --> 44:59.729
I've seen some weird stuff,
but this? Magic?

44:59.729 --> 45:01.588
We're seriously doing a seance?

45:01.588 --> 45:07.363
Shouldn't we at least be in,
uh, I don't know, Stonehenge?

45:07.363 --> 45:12.236
[Doctor Fate] Time is
of the essence. And it's not
"magic" as you understand it.

45:12.236 --> 45:16.009
We are combining our energy
to help Batman investigate

45:16.009 --> 45:18.781
Constantine's damaged memories.

45:18.781 --> 45:21.179
And perhaps find his connection

45:21.179 --> 45:24.083
to the Multiverse
and this crisis.

45:25.823 --> 45:28.417
[speaking Latin]

45:31.488 --> 45:33.290
[rumbling]

45:42.268 --> 45:44.268
[sinister music playing]

45:55.677 --> 45:57.512
- [thudding]
- [Batman yelps in surprise]

45:59.417 --> 46:01.417
[grunting]

46:16.434 --> 46:18.434
[dog whimpering]

46:26.642 --> 46:30.677
Oh, hello, Bats.
Fancy meeting you here.

46:30.677 --> 46:31.788
What am I seeing?

46:33.484 --> 46:35.891
[Constantine] I wish this was
just a nightmare, Bats.

46:37.389 --> 46:38.520
But this was real.

46:39.897 --> 46:43.690
I'd forgotten.
Earth had been invaded.

46:45.232 --> 46:46.297
Conquered.

46:47.795 --> 46:50.697
The old planet
had been ripped to shreds.

46:50.697 --> 46:52.842
Bastard named Darkseid.

46:52.842 --> 46:54.976
Never heard of him.

46:54.976 --> 47:01.741
Right. I think... I think I had
something to do with that.

47:07.485 --> 47:09.815
You know what you have
to do, mate?

47:09.815 --> 47:12.818
Clear the board
and start again.

47:12.818 --> 47:15.964
Now you just
leave that to John.

47:15.964 --> 47:20.298
A simple little guidance spell
from yours truly...

47:20.298 --> 47:23.565
And Bob's your uncle.

47:23.565 --> 47:27.404
You'll run off to right when
and where you'll need to be.

47:27.404 --> 47:29.076
To save us all.

47:29.076 --> 47:32.310
Off with you now.
I haven't got all day.

47:32.310 --> 47:34.576
You sent him
to rewrite history!

47:34.576 --> 47:38.217
- What gave you the right?
- A bit reckless. Yeah.

47:51.936 --> 47:54.167
[Lois] Billions
of people have died!

47:54.167 --> 47:56.763
Reduced to antimatter.

47:56.763 --> 48:00.503
And believe me, no one feels
worse about that than I do.

48:00.503 --> 48:03.506
But am I actually responsible?

48:03.506 --> 48:07.675
- For what?
- Murder! On a massive scale.

48:07.675 --> 48:10.711
They would have died anyway.

48:10.711 --> 48:13.615
Michael, Anti-Monitor aside,

48:13.615 --> 48:16.519
what is our estimated time
of survival here in The Bleed?

48:16.519 --> 48:18.961
Well between the exponential
population explosion,

48:18.961 --> 48:21.293
due to the time-displaced
individuals,

48:21.293 --> 48:24.230
limited resources,
and unreliable physical rules--

48:24.230 --> 48:26.529
Not too freaking long.

48:26.529 --> 48:28.938
That doesn't change
the fact that you sold us out.

48:28.938 --> 48:31.567
You made some kind of deal
with that monster.

48:32.306 --> 48:34.702
Wrong.

48:34.702 --> 48:37.375
I faced the hard truth
that we're all doomed if we
don't destroy this creature.

48:37.375 --> 48:40.378
An impossibility
without more data.

48:40.378 --> 48:43.480
So I simply
contacted the Anti-Monitor,

48:43.480 --> 48:46.417
and told him I was willing
to make a deal with him.

48:46.417 --> 48:48.716
Let me guess.

48:48.716 --> 48:53.259
That you'd give him
the location of the other
Earths if he spared Earth-10?

48:53.259 --> 48:56.394
The details of this supposed
deal are unimportant.

48:56.394 --> 49:00.101
We had to see him.
Find its weakness. Find its...

49:01.962 --> 49:03.203
Kryptonite?

49:04.536 --> 49:07.108
My world was
in just as much danger.

49:07.108 --> 49:11.112
But now we know
more about this monster.
Now we have a chance.

49:19.650 --> 49:21.056
What do you have in mind?

49:22.719 --> 49:25.621
Oh, don't worry. I have a plan.

49:25.621 --> 49:29.427
Plan? You are going to pay
for your crimes with your life.

49:29.427 --> 49:31.264
This will have to wait.

49:31.264 --> 49:32.496
Our friend is back.

49:42.739 --> 49:45.146
[Batman] Constantine,
where is this?

49:45.146 --> 49:46.840
[Constantine] Welcome
to Apokolips, Bats.

49:47.711 --> 49:49.381
Home of Darkseid.

49:50.648 --> 49:53.022
Evil personified.

49:53.022 --> 49:56.454
A lot like hell it is,
but not so nice.

49:56.454 --> 49:57.587
I ought to know.

49:59.228 --> 50:01.228
[energy warbling]

50:09.766 --> 50:13.372
[Batman] I see. The only way
to stop Darkseid

50:13.372 --> 50:16.870
was to eliminate him
before the invasion.

50:16.870 --> 50:18.839
[guard gasps and thuds]

50:22.185 --> 50:24.647
[Batman] But how can I be
seeing this?

50:24.647 --> 50:27.320
I was in your memories.
Not Barry's.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.388
They're mine as well.

50:29.388 --> 50:30.851
It's coming back to me.

50:32.789 --> 50:35.592
[guards choking, thudding]

50:43.536 --> 50:46.702
[Constantine] I sent a part
of myself along with him
like a hitchhiker.

50:46.702 --> 50:48.275
I wish I could remember why.

50:51.148 --> 50:53.214
[Batman] It may have
something to do with this.

50:53.214 --> 50:56.547
These creatures are dead,
but Barry barely touched them.

50:57.253 --> 51:00.188
Ah, that's right.

51:00.188 --> 51:03.015
There's one spell. A bad one.

51:03.015 --> 51:05.985
That'd require me to slice
off a piece of my soul.

51:09.056 --> 51:10.891
[rumbling]

51:36.655 --> 51:39.095
- [Superman] We failed.
- Useless.

51:43.365 --> 51:46.091
Every shield
shattered in seconds.

51:46.091 --> 51:48.093
I did this.

51:48.093 --> 51:51.932
They were all
as good as dead as soon
as I killed the Monitor.

51:51.932 --> 51:54.803
On the upside,
it was a post-apocalyptic Earth

51:54.803 --> 51:57.509
inhabited by mutant
humanoid animals.

51:57.509 --> 51:58.807
We were lucky.

51:58.807 --> 52:00.842
It was all
a waste of time, Lex.

52:00.842 --> 52:05.352
All the effort, the resources,
this was never going to work.

52:05.352 --> 52:07.618
I know. I never thought
it would.

52:07.618 --> 52:09.983
But every sensor,
every radio telescope dish

52:09.983 --> 52:13.459
on every possible Earth was
trained on the Anti-Monitor.

52:13.459 --> 52:17.496
Now, we see it. Michael?

52:17.496 --> 52:21.060
Gravity. It's all within
5% of your predictions.

52:22.470 --> 52:24.932
What he said about my world,
it's true.

52:24.932 --> 52:27.473
A battlefield of monsters.

52:27.473 --> 52:31.312
Compared to the other Earths,
it was a nightmare.

52:31.312 --> 52:33.039
It was also your home.

52:34.416 --> 52:36.350
This was all what?

52:36.350 --> 52:41.685
Some kind of fact-finding
mission? We already knew
it was a monster.

52:41.685 --> 52:46.492
But now, Captain,
we know exactly
what kind of monster it is.

52:46.492 --> 52:49.825
How big, how tough,
and what it'll take to kill it.

52:49.825 --> 52:52.058
What's your plan?

52:52.058 --> 52:56.205
The Anti-Monitor is made
of the same dark antimatter
as the shadow demons.

52:56.205 --> 52:59.703
So like them, he's susceptible
to light attacks.

52:59.703 --> 53:03.135
We threw every possible
light-based attack at him.

53:03.135 --> 53:04.411
Everything in The Bleed.

53:05.381 --> 53:07.447
Not quite everything.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.716
[Doctor Light] It's no use.
I crunched the numbers.

53:12.716 --> 53:17.556
Not even our sun generates
enough energy
to kill that thing.

53:17.556 --> 53:21.824
Ah, but it's not one sun.
It's hundreds of suns.

53:21.824 --> 53:25.025
Each Earth has arrived
with its own sun in tow.

53:25.025 --> 53:29.095
Their respective suns
are phasing
at the same point in The Bleed.

53:29.095 --> 53:32.208
Fifty-two suns should
generate enough light
to kill the creature.

53:33.442 --> 53:35.673
But how would we
weaponize that?

53:35.673 --> 53:39.611
Hmm, if only we had some kind
of living solar battery

53:39.611 --> 53:43.483
who could absorb, contain
and deliver that energy.

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

53:47.080 --> 53:49.885
<i>Can't you bury
your sick obsession
with killing Superman,</i>

53:49.885 --> 53:53.691
<i>even when, literally,
all existence is on the line?</i>

53:53.691 --> 53:57.299
Lois, he's not wrong.

53:57.299 --> 53:59.796
<i>Clark, don't you find it
a bit coincidental</i>

53:59.796 --> 54:04.097
<i>that the only way
to save us all,
involves destroying you?</i>

54:04.097 --> 54:06.198
[Lex] I call it
a happy accident.

54:06.198 --> 54:08.442
We've run a thousand scenarios.

54:08.442 --> 54:10.576
This is the first one
with a chance.

54:10.576 --> 54:12.809
[Superman] And don't know
for certain that it'll kill me.

54:12.809 --> 54:14.448
I'm pretty thick-skinned.

54:16.144 --> 54:19.453
Superman, even if
you survived the process

54:19.453 --> 54:22.786
of absorbing the energy
from multiple stars,

54:22.786 --> 54:25.591
unleashing it instantaneously
on the Anti-Monitor,

54:26.693 --> 54:28.726
you would not survive.

54:28.726 --> 54:31.828
Look, you can't make
an omelette without
cracking a few eggs.

54:31.828 --> 54:33.962
In this case, one egg.

54:33.962 --> 54:36.338
What do you say, Superman?

54:39.475 --> 54:41.442
One life to save
untold billions?

54:42.478 --> 54:43.774
I call that a bargain.

55:42.329 --> 55:45.341
[deep breathing]

55:49.743 --> 55:53.910
Blimey, I remember! The spell,
my damnation. Everything!

55:56.112 --> 55:58.882
Darkseid.

55:58.882 --> 56:03.392
Yes. He's a fixed point
in time, nearly indestructible.

56:03.392 --> 56:06.857
<i>His entire life,
protection spells
and defense technology,</i>

56:06.857 --> 56:12.291
<i>Darkseid was engineered to be
one of the immutable
pillars of the Multiverse.</i>

56:14.229 --> 56:16.438
He must exist.

56:17.936 --> 56:19.408
But as an infant...

56:19.408 --> 56:22.004
I'd say. It took some doing,
but I learned

56:22.004 --> 56:25.073
the only time in his life
when he'd be vulnerable.

56:25.073 --> 56:28.516
- The first year.
- Barry won't do it.

56:28.516 --> 56:29.748
It's not in him.

56:40.123 --> 56:41.397
[Barry sighs]

56:49.000 --> 56:50.505
[Darkseid breathing deeply]

56:55.435 --> 56:57.336
Don't you think I knew that?

56:59.274 --> 57:02.308
The spell. Darkest of magic.

57:03.278 --> 57:05.487
He's walking death.

57:05.487 --> 57:07.555
[Batman] Rappaccini's daughter.

57:07.555 --> 57:09.084
He doesn't even know.

57:10.285 --> 57:11.856
He's a living poison.

57:13.420 --> 57:18.500
Spot on! He's typhoid, Barry.
Radiates it.

57:18.500 --> 57:21.063
He doesn't have to do anything
to the little monster.

57:21.063 --> 57:22.834
He's already done it.

57:25.872 --> 57:27.333
Just being here.

57:31.339 --> 57:33.339
[rumbling]

57:43.692 --> 57:44.955
Kara!

57:46.123 --> 57:47.595
Kara, stop!

57:47.595 --> 57:50.862
- You can't do this.
- You can't catch me, Kal!

57:50.862 --> 57:54.261
When he made me the Harbinger,
Monitor supercharged my powers.

57:54.261 --> 57:55.933
This isn't the answer.

57:55.933 --> 58:00.003
It's exactly the answer.
I killed the Monitor, not you.

58:00.003 --> 58:01.774
None of this is your fault.

58:01.774 --> 58:04.469
The Anti-Monitor
manipulated you. Tricked you.

58:04.469 --> 58:06.713
I let myself be tricked.

58:06.713 --> 58:08.374
This falls to me.

58:18.089 --> 58:19.957
Let me go! Adam, I swear--

58:19.957 --> 58:25.028
Superman, it's too late.
We need you. Now.

58:25.734 --> 58:26.964
He's back.

58:26.964 --> 58:28.361
[distant rumbling]

58:44.181 --> 58:47.347
[action music playing]

58:56.457 --> 58:58.457
[heroic music playing]

59:03.068 --> 59:04.133
[grunts]

59:11.208 --> 59:13.208
[menacing music playing]

59:37.333 --> 59:39.608
[Mr. Terrific] Alpha Team,
concentrate your firepower

59:39.608 --> 59:41.566
on the center
of the Anti-Monitor shielding.

59:41.566 --> 59:43.436
We've got to give
Supergirl a shot

59:43.436 --> 59:45.614
at the creature itself,
not its armor.

59:46.749 --> 59:48.782
[weapons blasting]

01:00:12.467 --> 01:00:13.675
Let's do this.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.946
It's no good.
We're not getting through.

01:00:20.946 --> 01:00:23.344
Great plan, Lex.

01:00:23.344 --> 01:00:27.183
[Lex] Attention, Satellite.
Deactivate Cosmic Towers
immediately.

01:00:27.183 --> 01:00:28.921
What the hell?

01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:32.353
Those Towers are the only
thing keeping us in The Bleed.

01:00:32.353 --> 01:00:36.126
I repeat, deactivate
Towers immediately.

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:39.492
It's not him.
It's the Anti-Monitor
talking through him.

01:00:41.903 --> 01:00:43.903
[crackling]

01:01:12.868 --> 01:01:14.868
[energy crackling]

01:01:18.533 --> 01:01:20.940
Please, Clark. Quickly.

01:01:24.704 --> 01:01:27.243
Michael, do what he says.
Turn off The Towers.

01:01:27.243 --> 01:01:28.783
Superman!
<i>- </i> [Superman

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.723

[Constantine groans]

01:02:05.613 --> 01:02:07.613
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:28.942
We're home.

01:02:28.942 --> 01:02:33.573
The Anti-Monitor,
it's charging up.
It's targeting Earth-16.

01:02:35.984 --> 01:02:37.984
[lasers firing]

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:51.195
[Mr. Terrific]
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

01:03:09.149 --> 01:03:11.149
[dramatic music playing]

01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:16.957
I don't believe it.
It's really you, J'onn.

01:03:16.957 --> 01:03:18.783
Indeed, Superman.

01:03:18.783 --> 01:03:21.522
And fortunately,
you did believe it.

01:03:21.522 --> 01:03:23.964
We saw Warworld explode.

01:03:23.964 --> 01:03:28.133
There is no self-destruct
option for Warworld.

01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:32.874
<i>What you saw
was an entire planet
transported via Zeta beam.</i>

01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:42.015
But how? The amount
of Zeta energy
that would require--

01:03:42.015 --> 01:03:43.775
I had help.

01:03:43.775 --> 01:03:46.987
A friend arrived
at just the right time.

01:03:46.987 --> 01:03:49.891
But our work here
is far from over.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.290
You're far from over my ass.

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.193
You can say that again, J'onn.

01:03:55.193 --> 01:03:57.162
The Anti-Monitor has recovered,

01:03:57.162 --> 01:03:58.933
and is changing course
right towards you.

01:04:00.497 --> 01:04:02.794
He took a little damage,
but not much.

01:04:02.794 --> 01:04:04.400
Even with
planet-sized artillery

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.138
we can't get
through that armor.

01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:08.173
[indistinct warbling]

01:04:12.179 --> 01:04:13.574
[whooshing]

01:04:13.574 --> 01:04:16.247
Kara is on her way.
We don't have much time.

01:04:16.247 --> 01:04:18.150
Even now,
Kara does not have the power

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.350
to breach his shields
and destroy the creature.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.023
Michael, I'm getting
four incoming energy signatures

01:04:23.023 --> 01:04:25.388
- heading for Earth-18.
- Ignore it.

01:04:25.388 --> 01:04:27.753
We've got
bigger problems right now.

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:31.999
J'onn, isn't Warworld
powered by the hatred
and fear of its captives?

01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:34.331
Any unified emotion.

01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:37.070
Fear was simply
Mongul's preference.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.941
Maybe... Maybe there's a way.

01:04:45.311 --> 01:04:47.311

01:05:13.139 --> 01:05:18.078
We are a few of your recruits.

01:05:18.078 --> 01:05:20.905
When Oa fell
and the Corps was destroyed,

01:05:20.905 --> 01:05:25.250
the power rings you sent out
found us. Chose us.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:28.286
[Green Lantern Aya]
Or reminded us
who we truly were.

01:05:28.286 --> 01:05:30.684
The Green Lantern Corps
was reborn.

01:05:31.918 --> 01:05:34.226
Others soon joined us.

01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:35.997
We are here to help you.

01:05:35.997 --> 01:05:38.560
Now all will truly be well.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.728
It would be an honor for me
to share my lantern battery

01:05:41.728 --> 01:05:43.730
with the legendary
John Stewart.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.172

It's not going to hold.

01:06:45.165 --> 01:06:48.102
It will. Just put your heart
and mind to it.

- All of them.

01:07:14.062 --> 01:07:18.363
I've never done anything
on that scale. I... I can't.

01:07:19.432 --> 01:07:22.103
Nevertheless, it must be done.

01:07:24.767 --> 01:07:27.108
You do it!

01:07:27.108 --> 01:07:31.772
Only you have
the power to connect
emotions in this manner.

- [J'onn J'onzz] It must be you.

It's okay.

01:08:06.743 --> 01:08:08.347
I should have died
with Krypton.

Every moment then...

01:08:13.112 --> 01:08:16.421
With you, Monitor,

01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:19.787
with Brainy,
has been bonus time.

01:08:28.468 --> 01:08:31.799

I'm so sorry, Clark.

01:14:14.174 --> 01:14:18.376
To die so that others may live
is a magnificent act.

01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:21.247
A hero's death.

01:14:21.247 --> 01:14:23.854
Bloody tragic this is.

01:14:25.957 --> 01:14:29.695
Pity we don't have
more time to mourn.

01:14:29.695 --> 01:14:34.458
He's right, Clark.
As terrible as Kara's loss is,

01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:38.297
all of those worlds, there's
something much worse coming.

01:14:38.297 --> 01:14:40.838
[Doctor Fate] Our detective
has solved

01:14:40.838 --> 01:14:46.613
the great riddle
he's trained for all his life.

01:14:46.613 --> 01:14:50.342
What is the Multiverse?
We've all wondered that.

01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:56.656
Why so many parallel worlds?
Now we know.

01:14:56.656 --> 01:14:59.527
It was a mistake.

01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:03.025
This man is
from an Earth that existed
before our Multiverse.

01:15:03.995 --> 01:15:06.798
One decimated by Darkseid.

01:15:06.798 --> 01:15:09.196
A ruthless
intergalactic conqueror.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:12.804
So significant
was this creature,

01:15:12.804 --> 01:15:14.971
he was a fixed point in time.

01:15:14.971 --> 01:15:16.874
In an attempt
to save his world,

01:15:16.874 --> 01:15:20.240
Constantine tried
to destroy Darkseid.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.375
His unknowing weapon,
was Barry.

01:15:27.854 --> 01:15:32.153
[Doctor Fate]
Darkseid must exist.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:36.058
So Constantine's attempt
to erase a fixed point in time

01:15:36.058 --> 01:15:37.862
didn't change the universe.

01:15:39.459 --> 01:15:42.229
It shattered it.

01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:46.772
[Batman] Two universes.
One with Darkseid, one without.

01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:49.742
But it didn't stop there.

01:15:49.742 --> 01:15:53.372
Every critical decision
created a new possible reality.

01:15:56.982 --> 01:16:02.216
[Doctor Fate]
The Multiverse is expanding
geometrically moment by moment.

01:16:09.258 --> 01:16:12.633
Infinite Earths.

01:16:12.633 --> 01:16:15.867
[Doctor Fate] Unfortunately,
the universe wasn't designed

01:16:15.867 --> 01:16:19.739
to support infinite
variations of itself.

01:16:19.739 --> 01:16:24.777
The Multiverse is a cancer,
and it's growing.

01:16:24.777 --> 01:16:29.408
Ultimately, reality itself
must collapse.

01:16:34.921 --> 01:16:37.086
An antibody.

01:16:37.086 --> 01:16:40.727
You're saying the Anti-Monitor
is like an immunoglobulin.

01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:43.994
A natural defense
protein for the universe?

01:16:44.964 --> 01:16:47.228
Quite right, doctor.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:49.835
But there's never just one.

01:16:57.207 --> 01:16:58.338
Magnifying.

01:17:19.658 --> 01:17:22.626
Just one of them
was almost too much.

01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:25.299
We beat this one, but...

01:17:25.299 --> 01:17:26.971
But at such a high cost.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:31.272
There must be
something we can do.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.176
- Something we're not seeing.
- [Lex] Like what, Michael?

01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:36.310
Do you think
ten thousand intergalactic

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:39.214
doomsday machines
have an Achilles heel?

01:17:39.214 --> 01:17:42.822
I hope it's kryptonite
because I have
a storage unit full of it.

01:17:42.822 --> 01:17:44.450
So what do we do?

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:46.727
Just lie down and wait
to be erased from reality?

01:17:46.727 --> 01:17:48.355
How can we even fight that?

01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:50.159
We would need a miracle.

01:17:50.159 --> 01:17:54.394
Kara. She told me that
the Legion had a machine.

01:17:54.394 --> 01:17:56.869
A machine that
actually made miracles.

01:17:56.869 --> 01:17:59.366
Whatever you could
think of, it could do.

01:17:59.366 --> 01:18:02.369
Oh, I can think
of a lot of things. [chuckles]

01:18:02.369 --> 01:18:05.669
Oh, shut up. Fat lot of good
this Miracle Machine

01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:08.914
does us in the 31st century
that no longer exists.

01:18:08.914 --> 01:18:11.884
She said it was so dangerous,
they hid it in a...

01:18:11.884 --> 01:18:14.920
a pocket dimension.
Whatever that is.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.548
[J'onn J'onzz] Ingenious.

01:18:16.548 --> 01:18:19.683
She hid it
in between realities.

01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:22.521
Where even I can't reach it.

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:25.689
But you are not the only
traveler here, Strange.

01:18:25.689 --> 01:18:27.196
There are others
with the power.

01:18:27.196 --> 01:18:29.660
What about that fool,
Psycho Pirate?

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.938
Please.
At this point, he's useless.

01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:34.907
He's not our only teleporter.

01:18:36.108 --> 01:18:38.042
Nightshade can do it.

01:18:38.042 --> 01:18:40.011
[Nightshade] What?

01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:44.884
No. Uh, I can teleport
across the street
or back to my apartment,

01:18:44.884 --> 01:18:47.755
not... whatever this is.

01:18:47.755 --> 01:18:51.055
He's right.
It's the same power.

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.290
- [dramatic music playing]
- [whooshing]

01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:11.779
- Where are we?
- We're in between
vibrational planes.

01:19:12.639 --> 01:19:13.913
We're nowhere.

01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:17.147
Look! [echoing]

01:19:23.089 --> 01:19:24.924
[J'onn J'onzz]
The Miracle Machine.

01:19:30.261 --> 01:19:32.327
[Nightshade whispering]
Looks like it's been here
a million years.

01:19:32.327 --> 01:19:34.296
[J'onn J'onzz]
Much longer than that.

01:19:34.296 --> 01:19:38.267
Time passes very differently
in each reality.

01:19:38.267 --> 01:19:42.139
I know. So, what's it for?

01:19:42.139 --> 01:19:47.144
The Controller's
original purpose
for it is lost to the ages.

01:19:47.144 --> 01:19:51.643
But I suspect that it was made
for this very crisis.

01:19:54.483 --> 01:19:57.649
How do we get it back?
I can't move anything this big.

01:20:00.324 --> 01:20:02.159
You just did.

01:20:05.791 --> 01:20:10.464
[Doctor Fate]
The package is here.
J'onn's looking at it now.

01:20:10.464 --> 01:20:12.840
No, he doesn't know
what it means.

01:20:15.504 --> 01:20:18.076
Sorry. Talking to myself.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:24.049
Ooh, I wish
for infinity more wishes!

01:20:24.049 --> 01:20:26.183
[cackles]

01:20:26.183 --> 01:20:29.120
It isn't Aladdin's lamp,
you moron!

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.959
This is a scientific device.
Not magic.

01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:34.961
Who cares what it is?

01:20:34.961 --> 01:20:37.458
Let's use it to destroy
that armada
of Anti-Monitors. Now!

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.130
Even worse!

01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:42.001
If the Multiverse keeps
dividing, everything ends.

01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:44.003
All thanks to this idiot.

01:20:44.003 --> 01:20:46.973
[Constantine] She's not wrong.

01:20:46.973 --> 01:20:50.207
I've had a long time
to think about how to fix this.

01:20:50.207 --> 01:20:52.572
A long time.

01:20:53.674 --> 01:20:56.708
But no one's gonna like it.

01:20:56.708 --> 01:20:59.183
They've reached one
of the isolated Earths.

01:20:59.878 --> 01:21:00.921
Earth-508.

01:21:03.585 --> 01:21:05.585
[digital chirping]

01:21:27.774 --> 01:21:30.247
Earth-508 is gone.

01:21:30.247 --> 01:21:33.118
And the Armada is approaching
the remaining worlds quickly.

01:21:34.253 --> 01:21:35.087
Including this one.

01:21:40.589 --> 01:21:43.260
These things aren't just
killing the Multiverse.

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.594
They're erasing everything,
starting reality over.

01:21:47.594 --> 01:21:52.533
We use this beauty to create
a new monoverse.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:56.471
One reality. One timeline.

01:21:56.471 --> 01:21:59.804
A new universe
with fifty-some-odd Superman?

01:22:00.675 --> 01:22:03.082
Fifty Lex Luthors?

01:22:03.082 --> 01:22:07.614
[Doctor Fate] No. As we enter,
the various versions of us

01:22:07.614 --> 01:22:11.816
would be fused
into a single prime version.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:17.261
A single history
that we'd all share.

01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:20.429
None of us would remember
any of this.

01:22:20.429 --> 01:22:24.499
No. We'll find a way to bring
back the worlds we lost.

01:22:24.499 --> 01:22:27.139
We can't just give up
on all those people.

01:22:27.139 --> 01:22:28.833
We can't!

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:31.143
There was once
an alien scientist,

01:22:31.143 --> 01:22:33.706
whose entire world and culture
were going to end.

01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:37.347
If he could have saved it,
he would have.

01:22:37.347 --> 01:22:39.415
But he couldn't.

01:22:39.415 --> 01:22:42.946
So instead of vainly
trying to save everyone,

01:22:42.946 --> 01:22:47.456
he put all his talent
and energy and passion
into doing what he could do.

01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:53.066
He saved his world
by saving one person.

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:04.638
This technology is way
beyond our understanding.

01:23:05.806 --> 01:23:08.642
But I know dead when I see it.

01:23:08.642 --> 01:23:11.051
In my experience
with advanced alien tech,

01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:14.252
when it looks dead,
it may just need a recharge.

01:23:21.855 --> 01:23:23.690
[electrical buzzing]

01:23:28.334 --> 01:23:31.533
Okay. It does not run
on willpower.

01:23:44.009 --> 01:23:46.053
It merely sleeps.

01:23:46.053 --> 01:23:49.089
Green Lantern is right
about it requiring power.

01:23:49.883 --> 01:23:52.092
But how?

01:23:52.092 --> 01:23:55.018
[Doctor Fate] Do you
truly not know?

01:23:55.018 --> 01:23:59.627
There is only one power
that creates
something out of nothing.

01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:02.663
Of course. [sighs]

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:04.434
Should've seen
that coming a mile off.

01:24:04.434 --> 01:24:06.733
It wants a sacrifice.

01:24:08.275 --> 01:24:12.574
Well, I guess
we all know who's elected.

01:24:15.942 --> 01:24:18.580
Oh, come on.
It's obviously him.

01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:21.517
He's the reason we're
in this mess to begin with.

01:24:21.517 --> 01:24:23.156
You break it, you buy it.

01:24:32.959 --> 01:24:34.959
[speaking Latin]

01:24:46.841 --> 01:24:48.841
[electricity crackling]

01:24:56.851 --> 01:24:58.950
What the bloody hell?

01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:03.020
Try to do the decent thing
for once in my life and--

01:25:03.759 --> 01:25:05.594
Argh!

01:25:05.594 --> 01:25:08.927
[Doctor Fate] It's not a matter
of quality but of quantity.

01:25:10.502 --> 01:25:12.832
We're asking the machine
to make something

01:25:12.832 --> 01:25:17.309
virtually eternal
out of something finite.

01:25:17.309 --> 01:25:19.003
I'm afraid
the Anti-Monitor Armada

01:25:19.003 --> 01:25:21.280
has reached
another of the isolated Earths.

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:23.348
Earth-12.

01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:28.386
[thundering]

01:25:31.556 --> 01:25:33.556
[heroic music playing]

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.630
- [Joker yelps and grunts]
- [Batman grunts]

01:25:44.063 --> 01:25:44.963
[Joker groans]

01:25:46.868 --> 01:25:49.341
[cackles maniacally]

01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:53.103
I must say Batsy,
I'm flattered.

01:25:53.103 --> 01:25:56.678
The end of the world,
and you want
to spend it with me.

01:25:56.678 --> 01:25:59.978
I didn't know you cared.
[cackling maniacally]

01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:04.983
[whooshing]

01:26:16.601 --> 01:26:19.173
- [Joker laughs maniacally]
- I care, Joker.

01:26:20.506 --> 01:26:23.705
About Gotham, about justice.

01:26:23.705 --> 01:26:28.215
And if it has to end,
At least I go out like this.

01:26:28.215 --> 01:26:29.843
Being Batman.

01:26:37.182 --> 01:26:39.193
[digital chirping]

01:27:02.207 --> 01:27:05.945
Adam, can you move Warworld
out of harm's way?

01:27:05.945 --> 01:27:09.850
The antimatter interference
from one Anti-Monitor
was bad enough.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.116
But an army of them?

01:27:12.116 --> 01:27:15.053
Our Zeta energy
is completely neutralized.

01:27:15.053 --> 01:27:16.560
We're not going anywhere.

01:27:23.096 --> 01:27:25.228
[Wonder Woman] This machine...

01:27:25.228 --> 01:27:28.638
What if we offered it
something immortal?

01:27:28.638 --> 01:27:31.377
No! Absolutely not!

01:27:31.377 --> 01:27:34.578
I'll do it. Not Diana.
Let me do it.

01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:38.978
You are so good.

01:27:38.978 --> 01:27:43.785
And strong and kind and mortal.

01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:47.756
I'm sorry, love.

01:27:47.756 --> 01:27:51.562
This is not a job for Superman.

01:27:51.562 --> 01:27:55.258
I have spent millennia
watching people die.

01:27:55.258 --> 01:28:00.769
Friends, enemies,
I mourned them both.

01:28:00.769 --> 01:28:03.871
My immortality
separated me from humanity.

01:28:05.512 --> 01:28:09.415
Wouldn't this
give my life meaning?

01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:12.913
Anti-Monitor Armada
nearing our location.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:14.816
Now reaching Earth-2003.

01:28:47.686 --> 01:28:49.488
[dramatic music playing]

01:29:46.613 --> 01:29:48.712
My god!

01:29:48.712 --> 01:29:51.946
That's The Spectre.
Used to work with my mom.

01:29:51.946 --> 01:29:56.214
He'd terrify perps,
saying he was the wrath of God.

01:29:56.214 --> 01:29:58.282
You're in
for a big surprise, love.

01:30:03.289 --> 01:30:04.728
[Earth-2 Superman]
What happens to me in there?

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:07.731
A mystery.

01:30:07.731 --> 01:30:13.099
Superman will be there.
And part of him, will be you.

01:30:13.099 --> 01:30:15.365
And that's all I need to know.

01:30:15.365 --> 01:30:16.806
See you on the other side.

01:30:22.308 --> 01:30:25.309
[heroic music playing]

01:30:33.352 --> 01:30:35.990
[Joker whooping
and laughing maniacally]

01:30:41.668 --> 01:30:45.637
It's so... perfect.

01:30:45.637 --> 01:30:49.168
I don't think a great disaster
will ever happen there.

01:30:49.168 --> 01:30:54.481
It doesn't have to.
You can live in a human world.

01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:59.343
Or you can choose to arrive
in an era much like your own.

01:30:59.343 --> 01:31:02.016
I'll just have to make it
a better world the hard way.

01:31:09.861 --> 01:31:11.762
Will you even know
I'm Superman?

01:31:11.762 --> 01:31:14.864
Clark, if there's a Lois Lane,
she'll figure it out.

01:31:26.174 --> 01:31:28.779
[The Question] I object to you
and what you represent.

01:31:28.779 --> 01:31:33.784
Nevertheless. All you need do
is step through there.

01:31:33.784 --> 01:31:37.018
And you will be part
of a new universe.

01:31:37.018 --> 01:31:40.351
A false universe,
a false history.

01:31:40.351 --> 01:31:41.891
I reject it on principle.

01:32:03.211 --> 01:32:05.178
What's wrong?

01:32:05.178 --> 01:32:10.986
I, Helena, it took
the end of the world
for me to let people in.

01:32:10.986 --> 01:32:12.559
What if it
doesn't happen this time?

01:32:12.559 --> 01:32:17.663
Mom taught me that love
is beyond experience.

01:32:17.663 --> 01:32:20.600
That's why a jewel thief
can marry a vigilante.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.097
That sounds like her.

01:32:23.097 --> 01:32:27.266
What did... what did
your father teach you?

01:32:27.266 --> 01:32:29.235
To always stun a perp
before questioning.

01:32:29.235 --> 01:32:31.545
You don't want
any unpleasant surprises.

01:32:43.416 --> 01:32:46.054
Come on, time to go.

01:32:50.093 --> 01:32:51.224
You're welcome.

01:32:55.802 --> 01:32:59.639
Warworld's time is at an end.

01:32:59.639 --> 01:33:04.677
It has been an honor, Batman.
I hope we meet again.

01:33:23.929 --> 01:33:26.160
So quiet.

01:33:27.801 --> 01:33:29.801
It's finally quiet.

01:33:36.007 --> 01:33:38.007
[whooshing]

01:33:44.884 --> 01:33:49.788
Well, we might
as well get this over with.

01:33:49.788 --> 01:33:52.758
At least I know my way
around hell now.
Know what to expect.

01:33:52.758 --> 01:33:55.761
You're so certain
of damnation, then?

01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:59.523
[chuckling] I destroyed
a multi-verse.

01:33:59.523 --> 01:34:03.703
I know the score, mate.
Read all the ancient tomes.

01:34:05.399 --> 01:34:06.739
I'm done for.

01:34:08.468 --> 01:34:13.207
Not all the ancient tomes.
I usually dispense justice.

01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:18.652
Perhaps this time
I can offer...

01:34:19.479 --> 01:34:20.918
...hope.

01:34:36.562 --> 01:34:38.562
[crashing]

01:34:46.242 --> 01:34:48.242
[female giggling]

01:34:52.182 --> 01:34:53.753
[humming, gasps]

01:34:53.753 --> 01:34:55.183
[giggles]

01:34:55.183 --> 01:34:57.218
[humming]

01:34:59.288 --> 01:35:00.694
- [Hippolyta] Diana!
- [Diana] Hmm?

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:02.993
Huh?

01:35:02.993 --> 01:35:06.029
Come off of there this instant.

01:35:06.029 --> 01:35:08.031
[chuckling] Don't worry, Mama.

01:35:08.031 --> 01:35:09.736
I'm not afraid.

01:35:09.736 --> 01:35:12.563
[chuckles] You are
very brave, Diana.

01:35:12.563 --> 01:35:15.434
But even princesses
are not immortal.

01:35:15.434 --> 01:35:18.602
- Remember that.
- [sighs] Yes, Mama.

01:35:20.276 --> 01:35:22.276
- [Diana laughs]
- [dramatic music playing]

01:35:40.461 --> 01:35:42.461
[dramatic music playing]

01:36:30.610 --> 01:36:32.610
[dramatic music continues]

01:37:15.028 --> 01:37:17.028
[thrilling music playing]

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.025
[thrilling music continues]

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.048
[music fades out]
