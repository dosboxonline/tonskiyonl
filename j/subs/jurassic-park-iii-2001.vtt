WEBVTT

01:12.155 --> 01:13.634
Better hurry.

01:25.075 --> 01:26.588
Here you go, my friend.

01:26.675 --> 01:29.143
Make sure you get us
as close as you can!

01:29.275 --> 01:32.585
I'll give you something extra
if you make it a good trip.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.030
Hey, I'm going to get you
close, my friend,

01:35.115 --> 01:37.583
but not too close, eh?
You don't want to be eaten.

01:39.195 --> 01:40.389
Ready, amigo?

01:40.515 --> 01:41.743
Ready!

01:46.635 --> 01:49.672
One, two, three!

01:58.675 --> 02:00.267
Eric, heave!

02:13.835 --> 02:15.109
Scared?

02:15.985 --> 02:17.028
This is great.

02:30.035 --> 02:31.627
See anything yet?

02:31.875 --> 02:33.547
No, not yet.

03:03.675 --> 03:05.586
- What was that?
- I don't know.

03:09.715 --> 03:11.512
- Hold on!
- What's happening?

03:11.595 --> 03:12.744
Just hold on!

03:14.235 --> 03:15.873
Make it stop!

03:20.915 --> 03:22.348
What happened to them?

03:22.435 --> 03:26.553
I don't know.
Oh, my God.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.184
- We're going to crash!
- No, we're not.

03:30.755 --> 03:32.473
I'm going to cut this loose!

03:32.555 --> 03:34.546
- Let go of the rope!
- We're gonna crash!

03:36.395 --> 03:37.623
Move your hands!

03:38.715 --> 03:39.943
Come on!

03:42.715 --> 03:44.273
Here we go!

03:54.755 --> 03:56.313
It's going be okay, bud.

04:16.635 --> 04:18.432
Charlie, those are herbivores.

04:18.515 --> 04:20.551
They wouldn't fight each other.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.911
But these are carnivores,
and they really like fighting each other.

04:23.995 --> 04:27.908
They use their teeth and their
claws to rip each other's throats out.

04:28.595 --> 04:31.667
Alan, he's three.
Let's wait till he's five.

04:33.035 --> 04:34.548
Right.
Sorry, Charlie.

04:34.635 --> 04:36.273
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

04:36.355 --> 04:39.188
It's Tom. He says he has to talk
to you about the last chapter.

04:39.275 --> 04:41.425
Tell him I won't lose
the Jack Horner quote.

04:41.555 --> 04:43.785
My editor thinks
he's a paleontologist.

04:44.595 --> 04:45.948
Hey, Mark!

04:46.035 --> 04:48.503
Hey, babe, look who's here.

04:50.195 --> 04:51.708
This is Alan.

04:52.035 --> 04:54.549
Nice to meet you, Alan.

04:54.635 --> 04:58.264
Daddy, this is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

04:58.395 --> 05:00.147
Dinosaur man?

05:00.715 --> 05:03.832
Jack, say my name.
Is my name Alan?

05:04.555 --> 05:06.193
Is my name Alan?

05:09.515 --> 05:10.914
He used to know me.

05:13.395 --> 05:15.545
- It's sad, huh?
- Here you go.

05:16.035 --> 05:19.232
Thanks. Mark's been working
for the State Department now.

05:19.315 --> 05:21.545
What do they do, Mark?

05:21.715 --> 05:24.183
International relations,
mostly treaty law, things like that.

05:26.675 --> 05:28.506
- Here, I'll go.
- Call of the wild one.

05:28.755 --> 05:32.225
You guys catch up.

05:32.395 --> 05:33.908
Thanks, babe.

05:36.075 --> 05:37.747
He's a great guy.

05:39.155 --> 05:40.588
So, what are you working on now?

05:40.755 --> 05:42.154
Raptors, mostly.

05:42.995 --> 05:44.508
My favorite.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.825
Do you remember
the sounds they made?

05:47.995 --> 05:49.508
I try not to.

05:49.595 --> 05:52.393
All our theories
about raptor intelligence,

05:52.475 --> 05:55.308
what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

05:55.395 --> 05:56.510
Tell me.

05:56.595 --> 05:58.347
We did cranial scans of a fossil skull

05:58.435 --> 06:01.666
and found what looks to be a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

06:01.755 --> 06:03.871
Wait a second.
So we were right.

06:03.955 --> 06:05.434
They'd the ability to vocalize.

06:05.515 --> 06:07.506
It's the key to
their social intelligence.

06:07.595 --> 06:09.790
Which explains why they
could work as a team.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.627
They'd coordinate
attacks so their prey

06:11.715 --> 06:13.353
wouldn't know what was going on.

06:13.435 --> 06:14.868
They could talk to each other.

06:14.955 --> 06:17.071
To a degree we never imagined.

06:17.275 --> 06:19.709
Ellie, they were smart.

06:19.795 --> 06:22.628
They were smarter
than dolphins or whales.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.704
They were smarter than primates.

06:31.315 --> 06:35.627
I just wanted to say, if you ever need
help, sometimes you forget to ask.

06:35.994 --> 06:40.627
That you can call me,
anything, any time.

06:40.795 --> 06:42.228
Sure.

06:46.595 --> 06:48.313
You're still the best.

06:49.155 --> 06:50.554
I mean that.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.826
The last of my breed.

07:01.995 --> 07:06.546
It is through the study of the
anterior chamber in multiple specimens

07:06.635 --> 07:08.751
that we can
determine the correlation

07:08.835 --> 07:11.269
between the upper
palate and the larynx.

07:11.355 --> 07:14.472
This lets us theorize,
theorize, mind you,

07:14.555 --> 07:18.707
that the raptor was capable
of sophisticated vocalizations

07:18.795 --> 07:21.992
which would have been a
tremendous evolutionary advantage.

07:22.075 --> 07:26.512
Raptors were fierce,
intelligent and socially sophisticated.

07:26.635 --> 07:30.344
They were able to hunt in
numbers and coordinate their efforts.

07:31.515 --> 07:34.587
Were it not for the cataclysmic
events which overtook them,

07:34.675 --> 07:37.906
it's entirely possible that
raptors, rather than humans,

07:37.995 --> 07:41.465
would have become the
dominant species on this planet.

07:41.915 --> 07:44.110
I hope this has
been of interest.

07:44.195 --> 07:47.392
It certainly excites
us as paleontologists.

07:47.995 --> 07:50.463
There is much more to discover.

07:50.555 --> 07:54.992
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for, your support.

07:59.675 --> 08:01.074
Thank you.

08:10.915 --> 08:13.110
Thank you very much,
Dr. Grant.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.743
Now, does anyone
have a question?

08:18.595 --> 08:19.664
Fine.

08:19.755 --> 08:23.111
Does anyone have a question that
does not relate to Jurassic Park?

08:25.395 --> 08:28.068
Or the incident in San Diego

08:28.475 --> 08:30.750
which I did not witness?

08:33.434 --> 08:34.583
Yes, sir?

08:35.434 --> 08:37.664
Your theory on raptors is good and all,

08:37.794 --> 08:40.070
but isn't all this
conjecture kind of moot?

08:40.155 --> 08:44.512
Once the U.N. and Costa Rica and everyone
decide how to handle that second island,

08:44.595 --> 08:47.393
scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

08:47.475 --> 08:51.070
Dinosaurs lived
65 million years ago.

08:51.155 --> 08:55.307
What is left of them is
fossilized in the rocks.

08:55.395 --> 08:59.866
And it is in the rock that real
scientists make real discoveries.

08:59.955 --> 09:03.470
What John Hammond and
InGen did at Jurassic Park

09:03.755 --> 09:07.384
is create genetically
engineered theme-park monsters.

09:07.475 --> 09:10.035
Nothing more and nothing less.

09:10.115 --> 09:13.391
Are you saying you wouldn't
want to get onto Isla Sorna

09:13.475 --> 09:15.989
and study them if
you had the chance?

09:16.075 --> 09:20.591
No force on Earth or Heaven
could get me on that island.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.786
What we got here, Nashy?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.708
Einhorn 20-millimeter,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

09:37.835 --> 09:41.748
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating
bolt recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

09:41.835 --> 09:43.507
High explosive...

09:51.035 --> 09:52.388
Udesky.

09:52.475 --> 09:54.545
It's Paul Kirby.
Just checking...

09:54.635 --> 09:57.707
Yes, sir.
We're good to go here.

09:58.475 --> 09:59.988
Matter of fact,
I can lock things down

10:00.115 --> 10:02.310
just as soon as you
drop me that payment.

10:05.515 --> 10:10.191
Well, that's right, two of the very
best men I could possibly find.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.425
No, sir, I haven't worked
with them personally,

10:14.515 --> 10:18.713
but believe me, sir, both of these
men come very highly recommended.

10:26.915 --> 10:28.143
Are you all right?

10:28.235 --> 10:29.873
Nothing to worry about, sir.

10:30.395 --> 10:32.545
It's gonna be
a walk in the park.

10:41.755 --> 10:44.394
Billy, I don't think
I'm doing this right.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.945
Let's try the toothbrush.

10:57.235 --> 10:58.953
You've got to go slowly.

11:00.555 --> 11:02.671
Just take
a little bit at a time.

11:02.755 --> 11:05.747
I can never tell what's
rock and what's bone.

11:06.115 --> 11:07.787
Technically, it's all rock.

11:07.915 --> 11:11.191
The calcium in the bones is
replaced during fossilization.

11:11.715 --> 11:14.070
But you can feel
the difference. See?

11:14.755 --> 11:16.234
Rough.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.474
Smooth.

11:19.275 --> 11:21.072
Rough, smooth.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.629
Dr. Grant.

11:30.595 --> 11:31.744
Mr. Brennan.

11:32.395 --> 11:34.192
So, how did it go?

11:34.715 --> 11:38.230
Well, it's not too late to
change your major, Billy.

11:38.795 --> 11:40.592
- That good, huh?
- Worse.

11:40.715 --> 11:42.273
We'll have to
pack up in four weeks.

11:42.355 --> 11:43.754
Three.

11:43.995 --> 11:45.951
I had to rent some equipment.

11:46.115 --> 11:48.185
Come here.
I got to show you something.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.788
You like computers, right?

11:49.955 --> 11:51.468
I like the abacus, Billy.

11:52.075 --> 11:54.225
Meet the future of paleontology.

11:54.315 --> 11:56.624
It's a rapid prototyper.

11:57.315 --> 11:59.749
I enter in the scanned data
from the raptor skull.

11:59.835 --> 12:02.508
The computer breaks it
down into thousands of slices.

12:02.595 --> 12:06.474
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

12:07.795 --> 12:08.944
It's done.

12:18.835 --> 12:21.986
I give you the resonating
chamber of a Velociraptor.

12:22.715 --> 12:24.194
Listen to this.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.990
This is brilliant, Billy.
Really, it is.

12:40.475 --> 12:42.670
Sad to say, it's just
a little bit late.

12:42.795 --> 12:46.674
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby,
Kirby Enterprises.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.784
My card.
How you doing, Billy?

12:52.035 --> 12:53.832
What can I do for you,
Mr. Kirby?

12:55.555 --> 12:58.069
First thing,
I'm a great admirer of yours.

12:58.155 --> 13:01.227
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

13:01.315 --> 13:03.783
Would you have dinner with
my wife and me this evening?

13:03.875 --> 13:05.103
It'll be our treat.

13:05.195 --> 13:06.548
That'd be great but

13:06.835 --> 13:09.872
I'm tired, I've been traveling.
Maybe some other time.

13:09.995 --> 13:12.384
Believe me, this will
be worth your while.

13:12.515 --> 13:13.584
We'd love to.

13:13.675 --> 13:16.064
Oh, terrific!
That's the spirit. Good.

13:16.155 --> 13:17.713
This evening then.

13:27.155 --> 13:28.429
Billy, thank you for coming.

13:28.515 --> 13:29.630
Dr. Grant,
how are you?

13:29.715 --> 13:32.673
Amanda, this is
Billy and Dr. Grant.

13:32.755 --> 13:33.983
Mrs. Kirby,
how are you?

13:34.075 --> 13:35.554
What are you boys drinking?

13:37.155 --> 13:39.544
- Ice Pick, Catfish.
- Two, please, Cat.

13:39.635 --> 13:41.910
We've admired
your work for years.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.747
Really.
Truly inspiring.

13:43.835 --> 13:46.110
Amanda and I just
love the outdoors.

13:46.195 --> 13:49.392
We've been on nearly every
adventure tour they can come up with.

13:49.475 --> 13:52.672
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.

13:52.755 --> 13:56.509
We even have two seats reserved on
the first commercial flight to the moon.

13:56.595 --> 13:58.904
For our wedding
anniversary this year,

13:58.995 --> 14:00.951
we wanted to do
something really special.

14:01.035 --> 14:03.469
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.

14:03.755 --> 14:07.031
I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

14:07.315 --> 14:09.465
And we'd like you
to be our guide.

14:11.155 --> 14:13.146
There you go, guys.

14:15.115 --> 14:18.710
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby,
but I'm a very, very busy man.

14:18.795 --> 14:22.071
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

14:22.155 --> 14:25.033
No, no.
You're the best.

14:25.275 --> 14:26.754
You've seen these
animals in the flesh.

14:26.835 --> 14:28.826
There's no one
who comes close to you.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.223
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

14:33.315 --> 14:35.590
See, that's the
interesting part,

14:35.675 --> 14:38.030
because we have
permission to fly low.

14:38.115 --> 14:39.264
How low?

14:39.915 --> 14:43.749
I'm no aviation expert, but a heck
of a lot lower than anybody else.

14:43.835 --> 14:45.393
From what I understand,

14:45.475 --> 14:47.625
it's pretty much
whatever we want.

14:48.635 --> 14:49.988
That's hard to believe.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.032
Through my business dealings,

14:52.155 --> 14:53.986
import-export,
emerging markets,

14:54.115 --> 14:56.185
I've made a lot of
friends in high places.

14:56.275 --> 14:59.028
In this case,
the Costa Rican government.

14:59.635 --> 15:01.626
Dr. Grant,
you have no idea

15:01.715 --> 15:04.275
how important it is
that you come along.

15:04.355 --> 15:05.629
It would make
all the difference.

15:05.715 --> 15:06.784
Mrs. Kirby, I...

15:06.875 --> 15:08.547
And, of course,
we'd love to make

15:08.635 --> 15:10.671
a contribution to
your research here.

15:11.515 --> 15:12.709
So,

15:14.515 --> 15:17.985
I could write all kinds of
numbers on this check, Dr. Grant.

15:18.715 --> 15:19.830
Tell me,

15:22.155 --> 15:24.225
what's it gonna take?

15:38.515 --> 15:41.393
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

15:41.475 --> 15:42.669
No way.

15:43.195 --> 15:44.674
This one's lucky.

15:45.275 --> 15:48.904
Couple of years ago,
some buddies and I went hang gliding

15:48.995 --> 15:50.986
off these cliffs in New Zealand.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.990
And this big updraft came and swept
me right against the side. Wham!

15:56.075 --> 15:58.111
That does sound lucky.

15:58.195 --> 16:01.312
It was this strap alone that saved my life.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.866
Got hooked on a rock
as I was falling.

16:03.955 --> 16:07.709
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.710
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

16:13.795 --> 16:15.865
The bones will still
be there when we get back.

16:15.955 --> 16:18.469
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

16:19.635 --> 16:23.344
And truth is,
you got me into this.

16:24.755 --> 16:28.384
And I have no intention of being
on my own with these people.

16:31.835 --> 16:33.314
Don't get too excited.

16:33.395 --> 16:35.226
Chances are,
we won't see a thing.

16:36.515 --> 16:37.914
Your turn to be nice.

16:38.675 --> 16:39.994
Wake me when we get there.

16:47.635 --> 16:49.751
So how do you know the Kirbys?

16:50.795 --> 16:52.592
Through our church.

17:12.635 --> 17:13.704
Alan.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.787
Alan!

17:17.035 --> 17:19.265
Wake up.
We're almost there.

17:33.315 --> 17:37.388
Unidentified aircraft approaching
Isla Sorna, this is San Juan Approach.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.625
You're flying in
restricted airspace.

17:39.715 --> 17:41.910
Immediately turn
to coordinates two...

18:32.275 --> 18:34.186
My God, I had forgotten.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.105
We did it, honey.
We're here.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.787
Cooper!
If you see anything, yell up!

18:52.875 --> 18:54.627
No, I thought
I'd keep it to myself.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.752
I'm sorry. Everyone,
if you look out the left of the plane,

18:57.875 --> 19:00.548
you can see a whole
herd of Brachiosaurus.

19:00.635 --> 19:04.184
In fact, you can see at the front of the
group the alpha male grazing there.

19:04.275 --> 19:07.312
Udesky? Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

19:07.395 --> 19:08.794
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

19:09.795 --> 19:12.787
Mrs. Kirby, look!
Out here, you'll see a group of...

19:12.915 --> 19:16.066
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip.
You want me to put her down?

19:16.155 --> 19:19.306
No! I told you, I want to circle
first, see the whole island.

19:19.395 --> 19:21.192
What do you mean?
You can't land!

19:21.275 --> 19:23.311
Hold on.
I can explain...

19:23.395 --> 19:25.386
You cannot land on this island!

19:25.475 --> 19:27.750
- It will be fine.
- Don't worry, please.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.953
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

19:30.995 --> 19:33.225
Will you please sit down?

19:42.955 --> 19:46.504
Billy, tell me we didn't land.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.913
Eric!

19:51.115 --> 19:52.230
Ben!

19:52.315 --> 19:54.590
I think they're
looking for someone.

19:56.475 --> 19:57.794
Ben!

20:05.275 --> 20:07.630
Dr. Grant, are you all right?

20:07.715 --> 20:09.114
I'm sorry we had to be so rough.

20:09.195 --> 20:10.787
Who hit me?

20:11.115 --> 20:13.106
That would be Cooper.

20:13.795 --> 20:14.989
What are they doing?

20:15.115 --> 20:17.390
Setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

20:17.475 --> 20:20.547
Trust me, on this island,
there's no such thing as safe!

20:20.635 --> 20:22.512
We have to get
back on that plane!

20:22.635 --> 20:26.514
Tell your wife to stop making that noise!
That is a very, very bad idea!

20:26.595 --> 20:28.870
- Amanda!
- Ben!

20:28.955 --> 20:32.425
Honey, Dr. Grant
said that's a bad idea.

20:32.795 --> 20:33.944
What?

20:34.035 --> 20:36.708
He says it's a bad idea!

20:37.235 --> 20:39.066
What's a bad idea?

20:41.155 --> 20:42.713
What was that?

20:43.515 --> 20:45.153
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

20:45.235 --> 20:48.147
I don't think so.
It sounds bigger.

20:51.795 --> 20:54.673
We have to leave!
We have to leave now!

20:55.275 --> 20:57.152
- Get on the plane!
- What's going on?

20:57.835 --> 20:59.666
Get on the plane!

21:03.395 --> 21:04.510
What about the other guy?

21:04.595 --> 21:05.914
Cooper's a professional.

21:05.995 --> 21:07.633
He can handle himself.

21:07.715 --> 21:10.149
Get on the plane! Hurry!

21:10.475 --> 21:11.749
It's all right.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.512
- Paul, we can't...
- It's all right.

21:25.595 --> 21:26.789
We'll circle the island.

21:27.075 --> 21:28.667
Give me a hand, Udesky!

21:47.515 --> 21:49.346
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

21:49.675 --> 21:50.790
That's Cooper!

21:52.195 --> 21:53.594
Stop.

21:53.675 --> 21:55.506
Come on, get out of the way!

21:56.435 --> 21:58.073
You know
I can't stop this plane.

22:00.555 --> 22:01.874
Oh, my God!

22:03.755 --> 22:05.905
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

22:31.875 --> 22:33.228
You okay?

22:34.035 --> 22:35.912
We're okay up here.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.391
Everyone, just stay put.

22:38.795 --> 22:40.990
San Juan Approach.
Mayday, mayday!

22:41.075 --> 22:42.747
Who has the satellite phone?

22:43.315 --> 22:45.624
I do. I got it right here.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.394
I'm not getting anything.
The radio's gone.

22:57.075 --> 22:58.633
We haven't landed yet.

23:01.915 --> 23:04.748
- All circuits are busy.
- Damn it! Oh, man.

23:07.155 --> 23:08.270
What was that?

23:11.075 --> 23:12.827
Keep still!
Keep still!

23:12.915 --> 23:15.224
Relax. What is it? What?

23:17.315 --> 23:19.351
- What is it?
- Hold it!

23:21.195 --> 23:22.628
Hang on, everyone!

23:43.075 --> 23:44.554
Help me!

24:45.235 --> 24:46.907
Mrs. Kirby, come back!

24:47.275 --> 24:48.674
No!

24:49.435 --> 24:50.470
Amanda!

25:36.475 --> 25:38.193
Follow me! This way!

25:46.755 --> 25:48.029
In here!

26:22.915 --> 26:24.507
I think we lost him.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.147
It's okay, it's dead.

26:33.395 --> 26:35.829
Nobody move a muscle.

27:36.435 --> 27:39.029
No, no!
Please, don't!

27:39.115 --> 27:40.867
Stop, please.

27:42.155 --> 27:44.794
It's time you did some
explaining, Mr. Kirby.

27:45.515 --> 27:48.109
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

27:48.195 --> 27:49.310
No one would help us.

27:49.395 --> 27:51.989
The Costa Rican government
said this is a no-fly zone.

27:52.075 --> 27:55.511
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy,

27:55.595 --> 27:58.712
told us we should accept the
inevitable. Can you believe that?

27:58.795 --> 28:00.786
You let a 12-year-old
go parasailing alone?

28:00.875 --> 28:01.864
No!

28:01.955 --> 28:03.673
He wasn't alone.
He was with a friend.

28:03.755 --> 28:05.552
Ben Hildebrand.

28:05.635 --> 28:07.944
Paul and I divorced
over a year ago.

28:08.315 --> 28:09.748
All right, why me?

28:10.075 --> 28:12.464
He said we needed someone
who'd been on the island before.

28:12.555 --> 28:15.706
Yes, but I did not tell
you to kidnap somebody.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.789
I have never
been on this island.

28:19.035 --> 28:21.230
Sure you have.
You wrote that book.

28:21.315 --> 28:25.786
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

28:25.875 --> 28:27.945
You mean there are two
islands with dinosaurs?

28:28.035 --> 28:29.354
Stay out of this.

28:29.435 --> 28:30.993
How long have they been missing?

28:31.315 --> 28:32.350
Eight weeks.

28:32.475 --> 28:34.033
Almost eight weeks now.

28:36.355 --> 28:39.665
Billy. We'll go back to the plane,
salvage what we can.

28:39.755 --> 28:41.029
Then we make for the coast.

28:41.115 --> 28:44.710
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving
this island without our son.

28:45.195 --> 28:47.265
Then you can go
and look for him.

28:47.355 --> 28:50.188
Or you can stick with us,
as long as you don't hold us up.

28:50.275 --> 28:51.503
Either way,

28:52.315 --> 28:54.988
you probably won't
get off this island alive.

29:06.675 --> 29:08.745
So? What do we do?

29:09.955 --> 29:11.911
We search for your son

29:13.755 --> 29:16.144
in the direction
that they're going.

29:17.635 --> 29:18.909
Excellent.

29:44.715 --> 29:46.034
Sorry.

29:46.955 --> 29:49.594
It's nothing you
haven't seen before, Paul.

29:51.275 --> 29:53.835
How much weight
did you say you lost?

29:53.915 --> 29:56.827
About 25 pounds.
I've been swimming.

29:57.355 --> 30:00.870
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

30:00.955 --> 30:02.786
I know. I learned.

30:03.755 --> 30:04.870
You look good.

30:04.995 --> 30:06.064
So do you.

30:10.395 --> 30:11.987
How would you
classify it, Billy?

30:12.115 --> 30:13.389
Well...

30:14.035 --> 30:16.151
it's a super-predator.

30:18.315 --> 30:19.987
A Suchomimus.

30:20.555 --> 30:22.910
- That snout.
- No, think bigger.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.464
- Baryonyx?
- Not with that sail.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.191
Spinosaurus aegypticus.

30:32.275 --> 30:34.505
I don't remember
that on InGen's list.

30:34.595 --> 30:35.948
Because it wasn't on their list.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.947
And it makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

30:50.835 --> 30:52.587
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.

30:52.675 --> 30:57.226
When you climbed K2, did you
base camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

30:59.155 --> 31:01.908
30,000 feet. We were
pretty close to the top.

31:01.995 --> 31:04.668
You were about 1,000
feet above it, actually.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.106
No, that's a common mistake.

31:09.155 --> 31:12.625
There's no such thing as
Kirby Enterprises, is there?

31:14.115 --> 31:15.833
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.

31:16.235 --> 31:18.112
The "Plus" stands
for bathroom fixtures.

31:18.195 --> 31:21.028
We're in the Westgate Shopping
Center, Enid, Oklahoma...

31:21.115 --> 31:23.549
I don't suppose that check
you wrote us is any good.

31:23.635 --> 31:25.865
I will pay you
the money I owe you.

31:25.955 --> 31:27.547
This is good.

31:28.715 --> 31:32.071
Here we are, in the worst place in
the world, and we're not being paid!

31:32.515 --> 31:36.269
Wait, fellas. Hold on!
I'll make this up to you.

31:36.355 --> 31:39.267
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen...

31:40.475 --> 31:42.227
You're not really
a mercenary, are you?

31:42.315 --> 31:43.714
I never said I was.

31:43.795 --> 31:46.070
That's true.
What are you?

31:46.875 --> 31:51.187
I'm like a booking agent. One of
the guys got sick and couldn't come.

31:51.795 --> 31:53.387
Excuse me. Here.

31:54.315 --> 31:57.148
- So you run a hardware store?
- Paint and Tile, yeah.

31:57.835 --> 31:59.666
You never can tell
about people, can you?

31:59.755 --> 32:01.268
Ain't that the truth?

32:02.115 --> 32:03.946
- Eric!
- Quiet.

32:04.035 --> 32:05.354
Would you stop that?

32:05.435 --> 32:07.790
Dr. Grant says this is
very dangerous territory.

32:07.875 --> 32:11.345
Maybe we should split up.
We could cover twice as much.

32:11.435 --> 32:12.993
Dr. Grant says
that's a bad idea.

32:13.075 --> 32:14.588
Dr. Grant says this...

32:14.675 --> 32:17.394
Why hire an expert if
we don't use his advice?

32:17.475 --> 32:20.273
Except Dr. Grant
isn't looking for Eric.

32:20.355 --> 32:21.583
He's looking for the coast.

32:21.675 --> 32:22.949
Go ahead and scream.

32:23.035 --> 32:26.152
When that "Tricycloplots" attacks
you, don't come crying to me.

32:26.235 --> 32:27.270
Don't worry about that.

32:27.355 --> 32:29.471
- What? What did you say?
- Nothing.

32:29.555 --> 32:31.113
- Nevermind!
- What did you say?

32:31.195 --> 32:32.594
Paul, just drop it!

32:32.715 --> 32:35.866
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

32:47.475 --> 32:48.954
Eric!

32:49.435 --> 32:51.426
Mrs. Kirby!

32:53.075 --> 32:56.750
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are
remote they're still in the vicinity.

33:03.235 --> 33:04.588
Young adult.

33:06.755 --> 33:08.154
Hey, guys!

33:14.435 --> 33:16.232
That's my camera.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.194
The battery's dead.

33:22.275 --> 33:24.186
I've got an idea.

33:25.075 --> 33:26.747
Let me have the camera.

33:29.155 --> 33:31.828
Where were you on that one, Ma?

33:32.915 --> 33:35.224
Okay, dive, dive.

33:37.715 --> 33:38.943
Come on, Ma.

33:39.035 --> 33:40.104
Eric.

33:40.195 --> 33:41.674
Ma, you were
supposed to catch it!

33:42.115 --> 33:44.788
I shot this the morning they disappeared.

33:44.875 --> 33:47.787
No, I want that.
Let me take that.

33:47.915 --> 33:50.110
Come on, give me that.
Come on, baby.

33:50.235 --> 33:54.023
- See anything yet?
- No, not yet!

33:55.115 --> 33:56.673
What was that?

33:58.315 --> 34:01.751
Unclip us.
There's a big clip!

34:01.835 --> 34:03.427
I can't see.
I can't do it!

34:06.155 --> 34:08.032
I'm going to unhook you,
all right?

34:08.114 --> 34:10.913
One, two, three!

34:12.235 --> 34:15.511
Are you okay, buddy?
I'm gonna drop myself down now.

34:16.594 --> 34:18.187
The camera's still on.

34:21.275 --> 34:24.072
He's alive.
I know he's alive.

34:24.355 --> 34:25.913
We're gonna find him.

34:28.594 --> 34:30.630
Can you fly one of those?

34:30.795 --> 34:32.353
Maybe.

34:32.435 --> 34:34.505
As long as the sail is not torn.

34:34.594 --> 34:36.266
Well, let's take it.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.672
If we spot a plane, it might be
a good way to get attention.

34:39.955 --> 34:41.434
Pull it over this way.

34:50.875 --> 34:53.628
I got it, hold on!
Okay. Okay.

34:53.715 --> 34:55.194
Oh, my God!

35:01.795 --> 35:04.150
Okay, you're free.

35:06.675 --> 35:08.711
Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

35:08.795 --> 35:10.387
Amanda!

35:10.955 --> 35:12.024
Wait!

35:23.155 --> 35:24.588
Amanda!

35:33.075 --> 35:35.111
Amanda, stop.

35:36.315 --> 35:39.466
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about Ben.

35:42.635 --> 35:44.910
It's not Ben, Paul.

35:46.115 --> 35:49.187
It's Eric. He's out
there all by himself.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.346
I know, I know.

35:52.435 --> 35:55.666
Our baby is out
here all by himself.

35:55.995 --> 35:58.350
Listen to me.
We'll find him.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.224
I promise.

36:07.835 --> 36:09.063
Paul.

36:12.835 --> 36:14.587
Dr. Grant!

36:15.555 --> 36:17.625
You should come look at this!

36:48.835 --> 36:50.154
Raptor.

37:02.475 --> 37:04.033
We're going to find him.

37:04.115 --> 37:06.675
Are you listening to me?
We're going to find him.

37:06.755 --> 37:08.507
Kid's got resources.

37:08.595 --> 37:11.029
Remember what it was
like to try to ground him?

37:13.475 --> 37:14.624
Where's Billy?

37:21.155 --> 37:22.952
What are you doing?

37:23.115 --> 37:24.787
I was photographing the nest.

37:25.595 --> 37:26.948
Don't do that again.

37:27.835 --> 37:29.063
I'm sorry.

37:30.315 --> 37:33.307
If I lose you, it's just me
and the damn tourists.

37:42.155 --> 37:43.793
I bet you Eric is in there.

37:43.875 --> 37:46.435
Don't you think?
I'd bet my bottom dollar!

37:48.235 --> 37:49.873
What do you think it is?

37:49.955 --> 37:53.345
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

38:29.835 --> 38:31.109
Eric!

38:31.195 --> 38:32.548
Paul! Don't.

38:42.075 --> 38:43.872
What the hell.

38:59.795 --> 39:02.707
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

39:02.795 --> 39:05.263
I've got $1.10.

40:00.835 --> 40:02.951
This is how you make dinosaurs?

40:03.275 --> 40:04.503
No.

40:05.555 --> 40:07.671
This is how you play God.

41:03.515 --> 41:04.948
This way!

41:10.115 --> 41:11.468
It's locked!

41:15.235 --> 41:16.714
- This way, this way!
- Go! Go!

41:30.835 --> 41:32.905
Hey, over here!

41:43.275 --> 41:44.947
Push, push!

41:54.595 --> 41:55.948
My God.

41:57.355 --> 41:59.107
He's calling for help.

41:59.595 --> 42:01.074
Come on!

42:24.115 --> 42:25.753
Into the herd!

42:53.835 --> 42:55.348
Head for the trees!

43:23.315 --> 43:24.509
Udesky.

43:43.715 --> 43:45.068
Mr. Kirby!

43:46.755 --> 43:47.824
Billy?

43:47.915 --> 43:48.950
Is Alan with you?

43:56.515 --> 43:58.153
Oh, my God.

43:58.275 --> 43:59.867
Mr. Udesky!

44:03.195 --> 44:04.389
He's dead.

44:06.315 --> 44:07.828
Oh, my God.
No, he's not.

44:07.915 --> 44:09.633
No, wait.
Something's not right.

44:09.715 --> 44:10.864
We've got to help him.

44:11.595 --> 44:12.789
Amanda!

44:18.355 --> 44:19.424
Hold on!

44:27.235 --> 44:28.588
They set a trap.

44:29.395 --> 44:31.192
They actually set a trap.

44:36.955 --> 44:38.468
What are you saying?

44:39.355 --> 44:40.993
What are you looking for?

45:53.155 --> 45:54.349
Wait!

46:10.515 --> 46:11.664
Thanks.

46:12.315 --> 46:13.794
Thanks a lot, Eric.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.630
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

46:20.595 --> 46:23.348
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

46:24.195 --> 46:25.264
Together?

46:25.835 --> 46:26.904
Together.

46:28.915 --> 46:30.268
That's not good.

46:30.395 --> 46:32.386
They don't do so well together.

46:32.795 --> 46:36.754
You'd be surprised what people
can do when they have to.

46:52.555 --> 46:53.829
You're Alan Grant.

46:55.435 --> 46:57.153
What are you doing here?

46:59.275 --> 47:00.594
Your parents

47:02.235 --> 47:03.793
invited me along.

47:27.475 --> 47:29.227
I read both of your books.

47:30.675 --> 47:32.506
I liked the first one more.

47:32.795 --> 47:34.786
Before you were on the island.

47:35.635 --> 47:37.626
You liked dinosaurs back then.

47:38.275 --> 47:40.835
Back then, they hadn't
tried to eat me yet.

47:44.395 --> 47:47.068
When InGen cleared out,
they left a lot of stuff behind.

47:47.155 --> 47:48.224
Any weapons?

47:48.315 --> 47:51.193
No, and I just used the
last of the gas grenades.

47:51.555 --> 47:52.988
And I appreciate that.

47:56.835 --> 47:59.065
Be careful with that.
T-Rex.

47:59.875 --> 48:01.467
It scares the smaller ones away

48:01.555 --> 48:03.944
but it attracts one
really big one with a fin.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.592
This is T-Rex pee?

48:10.115 --> 48:11.548
How did you get it?

48:11.635 --> 48:13.353
You don't want to know.

48:18.915 --> 48:20.712
- Dessert?
- Sure.

48:25.755 --> 48:26.870
I have to tell you,

48:26.955 --> 48:30.072
I'm astonished you've lasted
eight weeks on this island.

48:32.035 --> 48:33.673
Is that all it's been?

48:34.955 --> 48:37.594
You're alive and
that's the important thing.

48:38.035 --> 48:40.947
Thanks to you, that's one
thing we have in common.

48:43.675 --> 48:45.552
Did you read Malcolm's book?

48:46.595 --> 48:47.789
Yeah.

48:49.195 --> 48:50.310
So?

48:50.675 --> 48:52.393
I don't know.
I mean...

48:52.835 --> 48:54.553
It was kind of preachy.

48:55.235 --> 48:57.669
And too much chaos.
Everything is chaos.

48:58.115 --> 49:00.504
Seemed like he
was high on himself.

49:02.715 --> 49:05.548
That's two things
that we have in common.

49:12.035 --> 49:13.184
Listen.

49:13.915 --> 49:15.109
Compys!

49:40.155 --> 49:41.383
Alan!

49:57.315 --> 50:00.751
No matter how this turns
out it wasn't your fault.

50:02.075 --> 50:04.384
Eric's always been
a strong-willed kid.

50:04.555 --> 50:05.829
Always.

50:05.915 --> 50:09.988
Then you throw someone like
Ben Hildebrand into the mix, and...

50:11.235 --> 50:12.384
Well.

50:13.395 --> 50:14.544
Well, what?

50:15.515 --> 50:17.904
All I'm saying is,
it's not your fault.

50:22.435 --> 50:23.504
No.

50:23.595 --> 50:26.393
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

50:27.355 --> 50:30.267
You drive five miles
under the speed limit.

50:31.675 --> 50:34.269
And I've totaled
three cars in three years.

50:35.195 --> 50:38.744
Well, not three. The Buick
wasn't really totaled.

50:40.235 --> 50:43.272
I just said it was, because
I wanted to get the SUV.

50:48.235 --> 50:50.624
I am so sorry that
you have to be here.

50:53.915 --> 50:54.950
I'm not.

52:12.115 --> 52:15.027
There's a boat,
right alongside the bank.

52:15.195 --> 52:16.310
Looks in good shape.

52:16.435 --> 52:17.504
Rescue boat?

52:17.875 --> 52:19.228
No, no.

52:20.035 --> 52:21.866
Just something left behind.

52:22.195 --> 52:23.389
But it floats.

52:35.355 --> 52:36.913
We stick to the plan.

52:37.715 --> 52:39.148
Head for the coast.

52:39.235 --> 52:41.066
You're not gonna
look for Dr. Grant?

52:41.195 --> 52:42.867
The coast was Alan's idea.

52:42.955 --> 52:44.673
If he's alive,
that's where he's headed.

52:44.755 --> 52:45.790
I agree.

52:45.915 --> 52:47.234
What about Eric?

52:47.875 --> 52:49.274
Eric's a smart kid.

52:49.395 --> 52:51.909
He probably knows his
best chance is by the coast.

52:52.035 --> 52:55.027
He figures the big dinosaurs
are in the center of the island.

52:55.115 --> 52:56.389
Right?

52:57.915 --> 52:59.064
Sure.

53:05.875 --> 53:07.752
You know what this is?

53:08.115 --> 53:10.151
It's a raptor claw.
I used to have one.

53:10.875 --> 53:11.910
A fossil.

53:13.435 --> 53:14.629
Mine is new.

53:16.275 --> 53:18.630
How much of the island did you explore?

53:19.155 --> 53:21.225
I stayed pretty close to the compound.

53:21.315 --> 53:23.146
I figured if anyone
came looking for me,

53:23.235 --> 53:24.953
that's where they'd start.

53:25.835 --> 53:28.065
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

53:28.155 --> 53:29.270
Are you sure?

53:29.395 --> 53:32.068
The closer you get to water,
the bigger things get.

53:32.155 --> 53:34.749
If we can find our way
down into the canyon

53:34.835 --> 53:37.508
we can follow that
river out to the coast.

53:38.275 --> 53:40.106
After we find your parents.

53:40.675 --> 53:41.790
Then what?

53:42.475 --> 53:44.352
- One step at a time.
- Listen.

53:46.075 --> 53:48.191
What?

53:48.355 --> 53:50.471
That's my dad's satellite phone!

53:54.115 --> 53:55.594
Wait a minute.
How do you know?

53:56.515 --> 53:59.393
Kirby Paint and
Tile Plus, in Westgate!

54:00.155 --> 54:01.508
Dad!

54:16.515 --> 54:17.664
Mum!

54:21.235 --> 54:24.068
Mum! Dad!

54:24.955 --> 54:27.867
Eric! This way!

54:30.635 --> 54:32.785
Mum! Dad!

54:40.315 --> 54:42.704
Mum, Dad!
Mum, Dad!

54:49.755 --> 54:51.871
I knew it. My God.

54:52.835 --> 54:53.904
I knew it.

54:54.995 --> 54:57.714
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

54:58.035 --> 54:59.832
Boy, am I glad to see you.

55:00.275 --> 55:01.867
Hey, you got my bag.

55:02.075 --> 55:04.873
Yeah. Lucky strap.

55:06.235 --> 55:07.748
Want me to carry it?

55:09.395 --> 55:11.226
We need to find a gap here.

55:13.115 --> 55:15.549
- How did you know we were here?
- The phone.

55:15.635 --> 55:17.830
That stupid jingle from the store.
I heard it.

55:17.955 --> 55:20.071
- My phone?
- Your satellite phone.

55:20.155 --> 55:21.713
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

55:21.795 --> 55:23.513
When did you use it last?

55:24.075 --> 55:25.827
On the plane.

55:25.915 --> 55:28.065
I got a call on the plane and...

55:29.075 --> 55:32.306
- What?
- I loaned it to Nash.

55:33.155 --> 55:34.986
He must have had it when he...

55:45.675 --> 55:46.824
Run.

56:51.235 --> 56:53.669
Alan, you want to
give me the bag back?

56:54.155 --> 56:55.668
It's okay, I got it.

56:56.475 --> 56:58.193
Please, give me the bag.

57:02.315 --> 57:03.543
It's not safe.

57:15.275 --> 57:16.469
Raptor eggs.

57:18.515 --> 57:21.348
Did you steal raptor eggs?

57:28.275 --> 57:30.027
Now it all makes sense.

57:30.235 --> 57:33.705
I swear, if I'd known you were
going to end up with them...

57:35.955 --> 57:37.070
It was an impulse,

57:37.155 --> 57:38.429
I thought they'd
be worth a fortune.

57:38.515 --> 57:41.632
Enough to fund the dig
site another 10 more years.

57:41.715 --> 57:44.593
You have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision,

57:44.675 --> 57:46.791
but I did it with
the best intentions.

57:46.875 --> 57:48.991
With the best intentions.

57:50.755 --> 57:53.508
Some of the worst
things imaginable

57:53.595 --> 57:55.950
have been done with
the best intentions.

57:57.035 --> 57:58.593
You know what, Billy?

57:58.955 --> 58:03.710
As far as I'm concerned, you're no better
than the people that built this place.

58:21.035 --> 58:22.024
What are you doing?

58:22.115 --> 58:24.265
Those things are after us
because of those.

58:24.355 --> 58:27.904
Those things know
we have the eggs.

58:28.275 --> 58:32.393
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

58:33.035 --> 58:34.832
What if they catch us with them?

58:34.915 --> 58:36.826
What if they catch us
without them?

58:40.835 --> 58:43.144
There's a boat at the bottom,
just downriver.

58:43.235 --> 58:45.954
We can try and make it
to the coast, at least.

59:41.675 --> 59:43.154
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:54.715 --> 59:57.070
Let's do this one
at a time, shall we?

01:00:35.595 --> 01:00:37.153
Okay, come on over!

01:00:38.115 --> 01:00:39.548
One at a time!

01:00:39.755 --> 01:00:41.108
All right, Eric.

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.352
I'm going to leave
you just for a minute.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.551
And then you'll be
right behind me, okay?

01:00:45.635 --> 01:00:46.750
Mum!

01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:49.829
I've been alone in a water
truck for eight weeks.

01:00:49.915 --> 01:00:53.066
I think I can manage the
next two minutes without you.

01:00:56.275 --> 01:00:58.266
Right, we're all together now.

01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:25.824
Okay, Eric.

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:27.588
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

01:01:27.675 --> 01:01:28.869
Over you go.

01:02:02.795 --> 01:02:04.023
Mum?

01:02:06.515 --> 01:02:07.743
Oh, my God.

01:02:08.235 --> 01:02:09.463
What is it?

01:02:10.115 --> 01:02:11.787
It's a birdcage.

01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:13.590
For what?

01:02:20.155 --> 01:02:21.349
Dad!

01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:22.550
Eric!

01:02:39.595 --> 01:02:41.187
I can't see him!

01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:51.264
No!

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:00.624
This way!

01:03:16.555 --> 01:03:17.783
Billy, stop!

01:03:18.515 --> 01:03:20.983
Billy, stop!
Don't, Billy!

01:03:40.675 --> 01:03:42.233
Eric, hold on!

01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:48.544
Eric!

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:02.910
Jump!

01:04:29.795 --> 01:04:30.944
Billy!

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:44.904
Let go now!

01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:32.508
- Eric!
- He's there.

01:05:45.315 --> 01:05:47.954
There he is!
He's across the river!

01:05:48.435 --> 01:05:49.993
Get him out of here!

01:05:52.475 --> 01:05:54.147
- No!
- Go, Eric!

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:55.994
What about Billy?

01:06:10.995 --> 01:06:12.269
Hang on, Billy!

01:06:20.835 --> 01:06:22.029
Wait.

01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:27.024
Get away!

01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:54.106
There's plenty of gasoline.

01:07:54.315 --> 01:07:57.193
Now we've just got to
make our way to the coast.

01:07:57.635 --> 01:08:00.149
Work out some sort of a signal.

01:08:00.795 --> 01:08:04.310
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

01:08:10.355 --> 01:08:11.504
Dr. Grant?

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:15.311
Hey, Eric, how are you doing?

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.827
I'm sorry about Billy.

01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:33.513
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

01:08:33.995 --> 01:08:35.314
I said...

01:08:35.715 --> 01:08:38.752
You're as bad as the people
that built this place.

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:44.269
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.

01:08:46.314 --> 01:08:49.227
I have a theory that there
are two kinds of boys.

01:08:49.314 --> 01:08:51.465
There are those who
want to be astronomers

01:08:51.555 --> 01:08:53.988
and those who
want to be astronauts.

01:08:54.555 --> 01:08:57.466
The astronomer,
or the paleontologist

01:08:57.555 --> 01:09:01.104
gets to study
these amazing things

01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:03.191
from a place of complete safety.

01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:05.991
But then you never
get to go into space.

01:09:06.115 --> 01:09:07.434
Exactly.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:10.867
It's the difference between
imagining and seeing.

01:09:10.995 --> 01:09:13.509
To be able to touch them.

01:09:14.115 --> 01:09:18.267
And that's all Billy wanted.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:26.510
Dr. Grant.

01:09:55.635 --> 01:09:57.626
You know something,
Dr. Grant?

01:09:59.435 --> 01:10:00.834
Billy was right.

01:10:26.795 --> 01:10:27.910
Listen.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.593
Find it before it stops ringing!

01:10:50.675 --> 01:10:52.586
Eric, you stay on that boat.

01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:57.750
It's here. It's here.

01:10:59.235 --> 01:11:00.509
God.

01:11:07.515 --> 01:11:08.664
I got it.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:18.308
Hello? Hello?

01:11:18.395 --> 01:11:21.944
You, too, can own a timeshare
in beautiful Guadalajara.

01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:24.913
Enjoy a meal in one of
our four-star restaurants.

01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:26.070
Look out!

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:47.992
Turn off the power.

01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:49.986
You've got juice
for maybe one call.

01:11:50.075 --> 01:11:52.350
Whatever you do,
don't call the U.S. Embassy.

01:11:52.435 --> 01:11:54.266
They won't do a damn thing.

01:11:54.555 --> 01:11:57.115
Hey, guys, come here!
Look at this!

01:12:03.755 --> 01:12:05.234
Bonitos.

01:12:05.395 --> 01:12:06.908
Something must
have spooked them!

01:12:07.475 --> 01:12:09.545
Get the engine
going, Mr. Kirby.

01:12:17.075 --> 01:12:18.588
Open the throttle!

01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:26.350
Pick up.

01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:32.830
Hello?

01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:34.144
Ellie?

01:12:34.595 --> 01:12:35.744
Hello?

01:12:36.155 --> 01:12:37.190
Charlie!

01:12:38.155 --> 01:12:39.747
- Charlie!
- Hello?

01:12:40.635 --> 01:12:43.593
Charlie, take the phone
to Mummy now!

01:12:44.475 --> 01:12:46.193
Take the phone to Mummy!

01:12:46.315 --> 01:12:48.465
It's the dinosaur man!

01:12:49.275 --> 01:12:50.264
Okay.

01:12:50.435 --> 01:12:51.470
Listen to me, Charlie.

01:12:52.675 --> 01:12:53.710
Charlie!

01:12:54.795 --> 01:12:57.832
Are you taking the
phone to Mum? Charlie!

01:13:27.235 --> 01:13:28.554
Hi, everybody!

01:13:38.315 --> 01:13:39.953
It's great to be here!

01:13:40.035 --> 01:13:42.390
Hi, there! How are you?

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:53.826
This is going to be great.

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.950
- Who's on the phone?
- The dinosaur man.

01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:10.627
He is? Alan?

01:14:10.955 --> 01:14:13.913
Look in the boxes!
Find a weapon!

01:14:20.995 --> 01:14:22.872
Where's the phone?

01:14:22.955 --> 01:14:24.593
- There!
- Get the phone!

01:14:34.395 --> 01:14:35.908
Ellie, listen to me!

01:14:36.235 --> 01:14:38.465
Are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

01:14:38.555 --> 01:14:41.706
The river! Site B!
The river!

01:14:44.555 --> 01:14:45.783
Hello?

01:16:52.035 --> 01:16:54.947
Dad! Dad!

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.548
Dad!

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.866
Paul, you jerk!

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:25.391
You can't leave me like this!

01:17:28.075 --> 01:17:29.713
I'm not going anywhere!

01:17:46.235 --> 01:17:49.307
Remember when we went
fishing a couple of summers ago?

01:17:50.155 --> 01:17:53.465
I was putting the boat in the
water and the trailer sank?

01:17:54.435 --> 01:17:57.950
The tow truck tried to pull us
out and it got dragged in, too.

01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:01.634
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

01:18:07.275 --> 01:18:08.594
I miss fishing.

01:18:14.435 --> 01:18:15.584
Mr. Kirby?

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.268
That lady you called.
Who is she?

01:18:24.195 --> 01:18:26.265
How do you know
that she can help us?

01:18:26.355 --> 01:18:28.346
She's the one person
I could always count on.

01:18:28.435 --> 01:18:29.663
I owe her a lot.

01:18:30.795 --> 01:18:32.706
I don't think
I ever told her that.

01:18:32.795 --> 01:18:33.830
You should.

01:18:36.835 --> 01:18:38.109
You hear that?

01:18:39.795 --> 01:18:40.944
The ocean.

01:18:57.715 --> 01:18:59.228
They want the eggs.

01:19:00.355 --> 01:19:02.471
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.

01:19:07.675 --> 01:19:10.906
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

01:19:30.355 --> 01:19:32.266
She thinks you stole the eggs.

01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:33.470
Get behind me.

01:19:53.875 --> 01:19:56.867
Give me the eggs.

01:20:17.715 --> 01:20:18.864
Do it, Mum.

01:20:37.755 --> 01:20:39.586
No. Call for help.

01:21:26.475 --> 01:21:27.954
That's a helicopter.

01:21:37.635 --> 01:21:40.707
Dr. Grant?
Dr. Alan Grant?

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.274
Stop!

01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:44.915
That's a very bad idea!

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.996
Second Squad, move!

01:21:56.435 --> 01:22:00.064
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

01:22:01.835 --> 01:22:03.587
God bless you, Ellie.

01:22:15.595 --> 01:22:18.189
- Dr. Grant, is this man with you?
- What?

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:29.503
You made it.

01:22:31.075 --> 01:22:32.269
Yeah.

01:22:33.235 --> 01:22:34.873
I rescued your hat.

01:22:35.875 --> 01:22:37.547
Dr. Grant,
we need to go now!

01:22:37.675 --> 01:22:38.949
Oh, yeah.

01:22:41.275 --> 01:22:43.425
Well, that's
the important thing.

01:22:44.035 --> 01:22:45.104
Dr. Grant!

01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:50.388
Can I get you to sit
here and buckle up, sir?

01:22:57.275 --> 01:23:00.790
Sea Shadow to Dust Storm,
six souls on board.

01:23:02.555 --> 01:23:04.625
Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.

01:23:09.315 --> 01:23:10.953
What the hell is that?

01:23:12.235 --> 01:23:13.827
Dr. Grant, look!

01:23:23.755 --> 01:23:25.746
Where do you think
they're going?

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:29.672
I don't know. Maybe just
looking for new nesting grounds.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:31.746
It's a whole new world for them.

01:23:31.835 --> 01:23:34.269
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.

01:23:41.195 --> 01:23:42.423
Let's go home.
