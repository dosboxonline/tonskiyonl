00:50.053 --> 00:52.391

I call this meeting

00:52.527 --> 00:54.924
of the Boonton, Pennsylvania
City Council to order.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.328
Please stand.

00:59.395 --> 01:04.600
[all] I pledge
allegiance to the flag of
the United States of America

01:04.735 --> 01:07.535
and to the republic
for which it stands.

01:07.671 --> 01:09.974
[Mayor Martinez]
First item on the agenda,

01:10.110 --> 01:13.543
an update to the construction
of the baseball field
on Juniper Street.

01:13.678 --> 01:17.182
With us is Steve Gorham,
general contractor.

01:18.085 --> 01:21.855
[Steve] As promised,
we will not be needing
an extension on construction.

01:21.991 --> 01:23.621
We will finish by November 1,

01:23.757 --> 01:26.426
within the period furnished
by our previous extension.

01:26.562 --> 01:28.988
What lies ahead is electrical,
plumbing, not including

01:29.123 --> 01:31.627
-exterior bathrooms...
-[voices fade, overlap]

01:31.762 --> 01:33.763
[Daniels] ...gonna be
some congestion...

01:33.898 --> 01:36.430
[engineer] ...we'll divide it
into four subsections.

01:36.566 --> 01:41.170
We now move to the next
part of the meeting,
which is open public comments.

01:42.073 --> 01:45.811
The Council will hear comments,
but is not expected to respond.

01:45.947 --> 01:50.151
Please remember to
limit your comments to
one and a half minutes.

01:52.883 --> 01:56.718
I think that we ought
to change our town slogan.

01:56.853 --> 01:59.586
"A Great Place To Call Home"
is confusing

01:59.721 --> 02:01.754
because when somebody hears it,

02:01.889 --> 02:04.063
it can mean that
it's a great place

02:04.199 --> 02:06.695
to call your home
on the telephone.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.731
[clears throat]
I suggest a clearer motto,

02:09.866 --> 02:12.665
like "A Great Place
to Refer to as Home."

02:12.800 --> 02:14.934
Though it doesn't
have to be that.

02:16.443 --> 02:19.044
We need a crosswalk
on Trent Avenue

02:19.179 --> 02:20.644
between Frost and Allegheny.

02:21.447 --> 02:25.979
It's a very long distance to
walk when you're in the middle
and you need to cross

02:26.114 --> 02:28.347
and you either need to get
to Frost or Allegheny.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.685
It encourages jaywalking,
and jaywalking is
an expensive ticket,

02:31.821 --> 02:33.557
and I know
'cause I've gotten three.

02:33.693 --> 02:36.725
Not to mention
a great way to get you killed.

02:38.195 --> 02:39.159
Thank you.

in case you're interested.

04:01.948 --> 04:03.009
Hmm?

04:12.588 --> 04:14.295
Have you heard from Tim?

04:17.194 --> 04:18.464
No.

04:19.898 --> 04:22.703
It costs a lot to make
a long-distance call,

04:22.838 --> 04:24.305
so I understand.

04:28.171 --> 04:31.741
Okay. Well, I have to use
the girl's room before I go.

04:45.387 --> 04:46.823
Dad?

04:47.693 --> 04:50.126
I found this
in the bathroom cabinet.

04:50.262 --> 04:51.728
Oh. [chuckles]

04:52.894 --> 04:54.731
Any idea why you put it there?

04:56.271 --> 04:58.570
I must've just gotten confused.

04:59.936 --> 05:02.307
Maybe the kitchen cabinets
were full.

05:02.442 --> 05:04.477
There's plenty of space in 'em.

05:05.645 --> 05:07.612
Well,
I must have been distracted.

05:09.077 --> 05:11.176
-Are you feeling okay, Dad?
-Yeah.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.784
You think that maybe
you should go get a checkup

05:14.919 --> 05:17.218
-to see how you're doing?
-I don't need a checkup.

05:17.353 --> 05:20.460
-Well, it can't hurt,
though, right?
-I don't need it.

05:24.266 --> 05:28.835
Well, I'm late for work.
But you let me know if
there's anything else you need.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.371

I have been talking to you
about pickleball

09:02.116 --> 09:06.716
for the past four years, and you
haven't done nothin' about it.

09:06.851 --> 09:09.855
Pickleball is a fantastic sport

09:09.990 --> 09:13.426
for those of us
whose knees aren't agile enough

09:13.561 --> 09:15.329
to get us across
the tennis court.

09:15.464 --> 09:18.258
Who's filibustering pickleball?

09:19.464 --> 09:21.030
Is that you, Wu?

09:22.199 --> 09:25.431
The new cold storage facility
near the highway

09:25.566 --> 09:28.935
is going to give our businesses
a marvelous way

09:29.070 --> 09:31.071
to store their perishable goods.

09:31.207 --> 09:35.312
But it also gives us
another thing:

09:35.448 --> 09:37.913
a giant wall.

09:38.049 --> 09:40.984
I wonder if this council
would consider

09:41.119 --> 09:44.691
commissioning a muralist
to add a little magic

09:44.827 --> 09:49.256
to what will already be
a valuable building.

09:51.064 --> 09:55.097
I think we ought to
change our town slogan.

09:55.232 --> 09:58.130
"A Great Place To Call Home"
is confusing

09:58.265 --> 10:00.507
because when somebody hears it,

10:00.642 --> 10:02.673
it can mean that
it's a great place

10:02.809 --> 10:04.970
to call your home

10:05.106 --> 10:06.911
I suggest a clearer motto,

10:07.046 --> 10:09.914
like "A Great Place

10:10.049 --> 10:14.050
Though, um,
it doesn't have to be that.

10:15.922 --> 10:18.622
We need a crosswalk

11:39.973 --> 11:42.636
I called you
a few nights ago because

11:43.472 --> 11:48.148
a spaceship had crashed
in my backyard.

11:48.283 --> 11:49.609
Well, now...

11:50.445 --> 11:53.651
a space man
has come out of the ship,

11:53.786 --> 11:56.152
and he's lying on my patio.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.419
I'm scared.

12:01.628 --> 12:03.159
I don't know what to do.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.361
Anyway... call me.

12:21.681 --> 12:23.041
How are you, Milton?

12:23.177 --> 12:25.744
Well, I'll tell you.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.617
-I've g--
I've got a real situation.
-[gavel banging]

12:28.752 --> 12:31.952
I call this meeting
of the Boonton City Council
to order.

12:32.087 --> 12:33.987
Esteemed Council members,

12:34.122 --> 12:39.164
I am delighted
to speak to you tonight
about elderly-youth connections.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.531
I hope eventually to collaborate
with this board on this project,

12:43.666 --> 12:48.335
but in the meantime,
I am launching a pilot project.

12:48.470 --> 12:52.274
I will be placing
these posters around town

12:52.409 --> 12:54.474
in order to connect
with a young person

12:54.609 --> 12:58.050
who would like to learn from me,
and I from them.

12:58.185 --> 13:02.856
I will keep you updated
on this exciting project.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.353
Thank you.

13:11.299 --> 13:14.460
We should change the town motto
to something clearer,

13:14.595 --> 13:17.031
because
"A Great Place to Call Home"

13:17.167 --> 13:19.334
can mean you're calling home.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.173
I feel there needs
to be a crosswalk

13:23.309 --> 13:26.907
on Trent Avenue
between Frost and Allegheny.

13:27.043 --> 13:29.076
I feel it is too far

13:29.211 --> 13:32.117
between Frost and Allegheny,

13:32.252 --> 13:35.288
and-- and-- and it encourages
people to jaywalk,

13:35.424 --> 13:36.483
and they can die.

13:39.059 --> 13:43.460
Also,
a UFO has crashed in my backyard

13:43.596 --> 13:47.631
and has taken out my azaleas
and has destroyed my bird bath.

13:47.766 --> 13:51.968

13:52.103 --> 13:54.772

-Yes.

13:57.871 --> 14:01.607
and taken out my azaleas
and destroyed my bird bath.

14:20.395 --> 14:22.533
You should not talk like that!

14:22.669 --> 14:25.803
When you talk like that,
it makes them all
take us less seriously.

14:25.938 --> 14:30.471
But it's true. A spaceship
crashed in my backyard
and crushed my azaleas.

14:30.607 --> 14:33.413
I'm dead serious!
You should not talk like that.

14:33.548 --> 14:35.374
It is not good.

14:35.510 --> 14:37.918
What should I do?
Not tell anybody?

14:40.989 --> 14:44.023
Good night, Joyce.
See you next week.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.422

14:47.158 --> 14:49.755
-You want a ride?
-I can walk.

14:49.890 --> 14:53.531

15:21.723 --> 15:24.459
Except for this situation
with the spaceship.

you let me know.

No.

20:40.541 --> 20:41.809
You're walking.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.150
That's a good sign.

20:46.285 --> 20:48.580
Maybe I'll show you around.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.581
This is the bathroom.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.357
You got hot water, cold.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.861
If the hot doesn't
come out right away,

20:54.996 --> 20:56.527
just give it a minute.

20:57.363 --> 20:59.398
Here's where you
do your business.

21:02.196 --> 21:05.102
There's things to read,
if it takes a while.

21:05.238 --> 21:07.134
This is the guest bedroom.

21:07.269 --> 21:11.344
If you need to stay the night,
this is where you'll sleep.

21:14.311 --> 21:15.813
It was a gift.

21:17.183 --> 21:21.318
The backyard, you already know.
That's where you crashed
into my azaleas.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.382
We'll have a word
about that later.

21:23.517 --> 21:24.817
The kitchen.

21:24.953 --> 21:28.555
Here's where
I leave myself reminders.

21:28.690 --> 21:30.557
And this is the living room.

21:30.692 --> 21:33.128
I mainly use it to watch TV.

21:33.897 --> 21:37.065
And you use this one
to control everything.

21:37.201 --> 21:40.802
The only thing you use this one
for is to change the volume.

21:40.937 --> 21:46.940
If you change anything else,
then I have to call Denise over
and she gets irritated with me.

21:48.681 --> 21:51.081
This channel shows the news
that's happening.

21:51.984 --> 21:55.983
This channel's the same, but
the people are a little angrier.

21:56.118 --> 21:59.525
This channel shows
<i>CSI</i> three times a day.

21:59.661 --> 22:02.161
I like<i> CSI</i> because
it always surprises me.

22:02.296 --> 22:06.696
You think it's going this way,
but suddenly-- Ooh!
It's going this way instead.

22:07.628 --> 22:08.964
[TV turns off]

22:09.100 --> 22:10.502
Oh.

22:11.269 --> 22:12.603
This is my family.

22:13.736 --> 22:15.841
She unfortunately
has passed away.

22:16.610 --> 22:19.071
She lives in town.
He lives in California.

22:19.206 --> 22:21.476
Moved there
about ten years ago for a job.

22:21.611 --> 22:22.908
I don't hear from him much.

22:23.044 --> 22:25.182
Th-- that's-- [scoffs]
That's okay.

22:25.317 --> 22:26.579
Young people are busy.

22:26.714 --> 22:28.520
I was busy at his age.

22:29.355 --> 22:32.189
Oh! It's seven o'clock.

22:32.325 --> 22:33.756
I forgot to tell you...

22:35.360 --> 22:37.395
about the dance show.

22:37.531 --> 22:42.160
[TV audience
cheering, applauding]

22:46.067 --> 22:48.007
-Hey, Denise!
-[Denise] Hi, Dave!

22:48.143 --> 22:49.575
How's the clinic going?

22:49.711 --> 22:53.808
Well, so far I've had
two neuters and three spays,

22:53.943 --> 22:56.042
and the day's only half over,
so...

22:57.210 --> 23:01.048
Uh...
your dad was in here earlier.

23:01.184 --> 23:04.284
He said some stuff which
struck me as a little strange.

23:04.420 --> 23:07.687
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, I don't mean to
make a mountain out of it,

23:07.822 --> 23:10.462
but he said he was buying apples

23:10.598 --> 23:12.658
for an alien
that was staying with him.

23:12.793 --> 23:14.499
Like an illegal alien?

23:14.634 --> 23:17.767
No,
like an alien from outer space.

23:18.734 --> 23:21.100
Do you think that he was joking?

23:22.903 --> 23:24.642
He didn't seem to be joking.

23:25.477 --> 23:27.980
[indistinct TV chatter]

23:28.115 --> 23:29.548
[knocking on door]

23:32.914 --> 23:35.048
-[Milton] Oh, hi, Denise.
-Listen.

23:36.190 --> 23:37.615
Dad, I don't wanna argue.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.857
You're 78 years old,
and you haven't seen a doctor
in three years.

23:42.993 --> 23:45.525
Please let me
schedule you a checkup.

23:45.661 --> 23:50.195
And I'll take you,
and they'll check you out,
and that'll be that.

23:50.331 --> 23:53.336
But I'm fine, Denise.
I don't need a doctor.

23:53.471 --> 23:56.668
[Denise] Well, if you're fine,
then they'll tell you
that you're fine,

23:56.804 --> 23:58.205
and that'll be that!

23:59.008 --> 24:01.914
And I'm not taking no
for an answer.

24:02.717 --> 24:06.145
Well, I'd rather say no,
but in that case, I guess.

24:08.121 --> 24:09.181
Thank you.

24:11.424 --> 24:12.957
Did you get my message?

24:13.793 --> 24:16.455
No. Did it say that
my mailbox was full?

24:16.590 --> 24:19.791
Remember, if my mailbox is full,
I'm not gonna get the message.

24:19.927 --> 24:22.734
-Um...
-[phone ringing]

24:22.869 --> 24:24.962
All right, you should get that.
And I'm late.

24:25.098 --> 24:27.334
I'll talk to you later, okay?

24:27.469 --> 24:28.733
Oh, okay.

24:28.869 --> 24:32.171
[ringing continues]

24:35.309 --> 24:38.883
-Hello?
-[Sandy]<i> Hi, Milt, it's Sandy.</i>

24:39.019 --> 24:40.082
Oh.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.553
I found your number
in the phonebook.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.284
I hope you don't mind
I'm calling.

24:45.621 --> 24:48.891
-No.
-[Sandy]<i> Milton, do you happen</i>
<i>to have a printer?</i>

24:49.657 --> 24:51.327
A printer?

24:51.462 --> 24:53.060
<i>Let me see.</i>

24:53.195 --> 24:55.531
<i>Denise set me up</i>
<i>with a lot of things</i>

24:55.666 --> 24:57.433
when she stopped using them.

24:57.569 --> 24:59.504
Yeah, I have a printer.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.307
Oh!
Mine stopped working long ago.

25:02.442 --> 25:04.175
Computer stopped recognizing it.

25:04.978 --> 25:07.578
<i>Anyhow, do-- do you think</i>
<i>I could use yours?</i>

25:07.714 --> 25:10.814
It's for the poster
for the program.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.185
Don't they have one
in the library?

25:14.955 --> 25:17.887
[Sandy]<i> I don't think</i>
<i>they still have one.</i>

25:18.853 --> 25:20.887
If-- if it's a problem--

25:21.022 --> 25:24.326
It-- it isn't a problem,
I guess.

25:24.461 --> 25:26.432
[doorbell rings]

25:26.568 --> 25:28.866
-[Sandy] Hey, Milt.
-Hi, Sandy.

25:29.002 --> 25:32.264
Uh... I really wish
these machines would warn you

25:32.399 --> 25:35.170
before they screw themselves up
like that.

25:35.306 --> 25:37.842
I'll probably print about 22.
On my way through town,

25:37.977 --> 25:39.942
I thought of an another
couple of places to--

25:40.077 --> 25:43.377
[gasps] Oh, good Christ!
What the fuck is that?

25:44.313 --> 25:47.279
You remember the spaceship
that crashed in my yard?

25:47.414 --> 25:50.385
This is the little man
who came out of it.

25:50.521 --> 25:52.324
This is Sandy.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.352
She's an acquaintance of mine.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.260
Milton, what is this?

26:00.097 --> 26:03.834
Uh, this is an alien from space,
I suppose.

26:06.036 --> 26:07.766
[shakily] How long
has he been here?

26:07.902 --> 26:10.073
Oh, for a few days.

26:10.209 --> 26:14.813
Though the first couple days
he was inside the spaceship.

26:15.883 --> 26:19.284
Mm-hmm. And he's just
sitting on your couch?

26:19.419 --> 26:21.782
Yeah. He's very friendly.

26:21.917 --> 26:23.920
He watches whatever I watch.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.659
He's undemanding.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.288
Oh, my Lord,
I think I need to sit down.

26:34.896 --> 26:36.533
Oh, my God, Milton.

26:36.668 --> 26:39.634
This-- this is a very big thing.

26:39.769 --> 26:41.769
Yeah, I suppose it is.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.902
[panicked laugh] This is a being

26:45.038 --> 26:48.010
from a-- another galaxy.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.480
This has never happened before.

26:51.616 --> 26:53.114
I guess that's true.

26:55.356 --> 26:57.055
And there's a ship?

26:57.191 --> 27:02.758
[♪]

27:02.894 --> 27:05.865
-Oh, dear God.
-[Milton] Yep.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.900
I think it'll be a couple
seasons before they grow back.

27:14.238 --> 27:17.040
When he arrived,
he wasn't doing nearly so well.

27:17.175 --> 27:20.312
He was really banged up
from the crash landing.

27:20.448 --> 27:24.282
But he's been
eating apples ever since,
and I guess they've helped him.

27:24.417 --> 27:26.312
-Apples?
-Yeah.

27:28.115 --> 27:29.783
And you wanna keep him here?

27:29.919 --> 27:31.049
As long as he wants to.

27:31.185 --> 27:33.317
Mmm, I don't know about that.

27:33.453 --> 27:35.821
He may be a threat.
We don't know.

27:35.956 --> 27:37.455
I really doubt it.

27:40.394 --> 27:45.103
Listen, Milton, if you wanna
keep him here, you've got to
stop telling people about him.

27:45.239 --> 27:49.369
No more just letting people
come over like you did with me.

27:49.505 --> 27:52.741
I-- I've seen what people do
with these kinds of guys.

27:52.876 --> 27:54.608
This has happened to you before?

27:54.743 --> 27:56.106
No! [scoffs]

27:56.943 --> 28:01.380
From the movies, and the-- the
movies are based on something.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.922
He's gotta be a secret.

28:05.724 --> 28:06.986
No more telling anyone.

28:07.121 --> 28:10.227
You know, and I know, and...

28:11.030 --> 28:14.627
[chuckles]
...I'm not telling anybody.

28:14.763 --> 28:21.972
[♪]

28:26.544 --> 28:29.375
Hmm. Sandy?

28:39.758 --> 28:41.689
Are you sure it's safe?

28:41.824 --> 28:43.961
Far as I can tell,

28:44.829 --> 28:46.897
he's really far from home.

28:47.033 --> 28:49.461
Seems like he would
be the scared one.

28:50.966 --> 28:52.805
I'll see you soon, Milt.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.974
And remember,

28:57.808 --> 29:00.375
don't tell anybody.

29:00.511 --> 29:01.908
I won't.

I think you'll like her.

<i>-She wanted to help.</i>
-[man 2 on TV]<i> You're sure</i>
<i>she wanted to help,</i>

30:02.001 --> 30:04.342
<i>or had she simply</i>
<i>exhausted her options, Robert?</i>

30:04.477 --> 30:07.409
[Robert]<i> That's right, John.</i>
<i>She exhausted her options.</i>

30:07.545 --> 30:09.875
<i>Nothing she could do was</i>
<i>going to fix what she did.</i>

30:10.010 --> 30:12.511
<i>So why help now? 'Cause she</i>
<i>honestly wanted to do good.</i>

30:12.646 --> 30:17.084
[John]<i> Robert, I'm sorry, but</i>
<i>I'm not buying it for a second.</i>
<i>I know she's your daughter.</i>

31:07.773 --> 31:09.304
[Milt] Good morning.

31:14.044 --> 31:17.048
Repairs have begun. That's good.

31:17.816 --> 31:19.810
I hope you can fix it.

31:19.946 --> 31:23.615
Must not be easy to be
stuck on a different planet.

31:26.254 --> 31:28.856
Thank you for the picture.

31:28.992 --> 31:30.963
It's very beautiful.

31:34.901 --> 31:36.694
I'm gonna put some coffee on.

31:48.214 --> 31:50.642
[Dr. North]
We're looking for differences.

31:50.777 --> 31:53.953
Could you circle the one
that's different, please?

31:57.953 --> 31:59.321
[sighs]

32:07.427 --> 32:09.331
I'm gonna show you four objects.

32:11.965 --> 32:15.975
Do me a favor, Milton,
and remember these objects.

32:21.944 --> 32:26.885
Now I'm going to show you a new
paper with three of the objects.

32:27.021 --> 32:29.681
You tell me
which one is missing.

32:32.626 --> 32:34.224
[Milton sighs]

32:44.170 --> 32:46.966
Jump rope.
The word is jump rope.

32:47.102 --> 32:48.403
You have that?

32:50.444 --> 32:51.539
Yeah.

32:52.576 --> 32:55.278
[Dr. North] I'm going to
tell you a short story.

32:58.383 --> 33:01.516
A young girl went
to the store to buy grapes.

33:01.652 --> 33:05.218
When she got there,
she didn't have enough money,

33:05.353 --> 33:07.487
so she bought milk instead.

33:07.622 --> 33:10.528
At home,
her mother asked what happened.

33:11.297 --> 33:15.298
Milton, what was the word
I asked you to remember?

33:16.636 --> 33:23.504
[♪]

33:28.142 --> 33:29.411
[chuckles]

33:33.381 --> 33:36.318
It must be strange for you,

33:36.453 --> 33:39.318
having me here
and-- and Milton gone.

33:39.453 --> 33:41.522
He'll be back shortly. He--

33:41.657 --> 33:46.329
he just had a-- an appointment
he had to go to.

33:48.934 --> 33:50.597
Do you understand me?

33:51.766 --> 33:55.107
With those eyes,
it-- it seems like you do.

33:56.137 --> 33:57.604
[sighs]

33:57.740 --> 34:02.645
Well, since you can't talk,
I guess I will.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.677
Um...

34:11.054 --> 34:13.018
I have a daughter.

34:13.153 --> 34:14.423
Uh...

34:15.521 --> 34:17.257
we get along pretty well,

34:17.392 --> 34:19.130
but I don't get to see her much.

34:19.265 --> 34:22.761
She, uh, lives out
on the West Coast.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.172
I have pictures.

34:28.839 --> 34:30.274
Uh...

34:32.209 --> 34:35.180
Monica. That's her partner Lisa.

34:36.114 --> 34:38.216
That's my grandson, Philip.

34:39.479 --> 34:43.254
She and she are together.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.620
You know, together-together?

34:47.922 --> 34:50.328
I don't know if you have that
on your planet,

34:50.464 --> 34:54.131
where two people of the same sex
end up loving each other,

34:54.267 --> 34:57.130
but it's been
happening here a lot

34:57.266 --> 34:59.564
over the last few years.

34:59.699 --> 35:05.373
I let her know from the start
that it didn't make
a hair's difference to me.

35:06.209 --> 35:10.647
[voice breaks]
And, uh, wouldn't you know,
they spend all their time

35:10.782 --> 35:17.222
sucking up to her mother instead
of coming out here to see me.

35:22.461 --> 35:25.263
[sobs] I haven't seen them
in person in--

35:26.426 --> 35:27.925
in three years.

35:29.868 --> 35:31.896
[laughing]

35:32.032 --> 35:37.308
I swear to God,
I don't normally talk this much!

35:39.212 --> 35:43.981
Milton, do you find yourself
having trouble recollecting
information about yourself

35:44.116 --> 35:45.576
that you've known all your life?

35:45.711 --> 35:47.585
Your birthday, your middle name?

35:47.720 --> 35:50.548
Do you leave objects in places
where they normally don't go

35:50.683 --> 35:52.587
and not realize until later?

35:53.352 --> 35:54.622
No.

35:56.160 --> 35:57.924
-Dad.
-I don't.

35:58.927 --> 36:02.062
He left a can of green beans
in the bathroom cabinet.

36:02.932 --> 36:06.271
That was just once.
I was probably just confused.

36:08.506 --> 36:10.638
I found a newspaper
in the freezer.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.339
[scoffs]
That also was just once.

36:15.909 --> 36:21.047
But Dad, that's not the point.
The point is that together,
they're kinda happening often.

36:21.182 --> 36:22.716
He, uh...

36:25.124 --> 36:29.360
he told the cashier at Corrado's
that there was an alien
living in his house.

36:30.891 --> 36:33.598
Milton,
do you remember saying that?

36:33.733 --> 36:34.825
Yeah.

36:34.961 --> 36:36.899
Do you remember
why you said that?

36:37.035 --> 36:38.462
It was a joke.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.973
I don't think it was
a joke when you said it.
I think that you meant it.

36:43.109 --> 36:46.610
I think that he thought
that there was an alien
living in his house.

36:47.547 --> 36:51.042
Milton, this is
a sensitive subject to bring up,

36:51.178 --> 36:55.146
but at your age, and with
these deficits in your thinking,

36:55.282 --> 36:59.188
it may be time to consider
options for assisted living,

36:59.323 --> 37:01.018
such as an in-home caregiver

37:01.153 --> 37:03.155
or moving to
an assisted-living facility.

37:03.290 --> 37:06.558
-Nope.
-Dad, just try to listen
to what she has to say!

37:06.693 --> 37:08.564
No, I'm sorry. I need to go.

37:08.699 --> 37:11.901
I've got a--
<i>Anderson Cooper</i> is on.

37:12.036 --> 37:14.570
Dad. Wait.

37:14.705 --> 37:17.703
You set me up!
God damn it, you set me up!

37:17.839 --> 37:20.445
I did it because
I'm worried about you.

37:20.581 --> 37:23.645
You brought me here,
had her spring that test on me

37:23.780 --> 37:25.713
without even giving me
a chance to study!

37:25.848 --> 37:28.617
-I'm trying to help.
-I don't need your help!

37:30.923 --> 37:32.055

37:32.190 --> 37:38.891

37:46.800 --> 37:48.606

-Hey, Milt.

37:48.742 --> 37:51.874
I'm just reading him a book
I found in Monica's baby things.

37:52.009 --> 37:53.204
Milty?

37:54.107 --> 37:56.042
-Is everything okay?
-[Milton] I'm fine!

37:56.178 --> 37:59.143
-[door slams]
-[scoffs] Are you sure
you're fine?

38:00.046 --> 38:02.915
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.489
He's had lunch.

Denise thinks I'm losing it.
She wants to put me in a home.

38:48.934 --> 38:53.834
I think I called her too many
times to fix the TV system.

39:03.777 --> 39:05.549
I don't talk to my son.

39:06.913 --> 39:08.816
He doesn't like me very much.

39:10.083 --> 39:12.787
I understand it.
I wasn't good at...

39:14.422 --> 39:15.552
being a dad.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.028
So I stopped.

39:17.831 --> 39:21.964
No sense keeping going with
something you're not good at.

It's Dad.

39:51.924 --> 39:53.663
Hope things are good there.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.129
Fall's starting to show up here.

40:01.439 --> 40:03.167
Denise's clinic has moved,

40:04.578 --> 40:06.973
next to that new car wash
out on Lincoln.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.581
Was that here
when you were here?

40:12.250 --> 40:13.518
I don't know.

40:15.952 --> 40:18.215
We'll see how she deals
with the noise.

40:19.790 --> 40:22.087
Maybe the dogs
will get riled up.

40:25.328 --> 40:26.597
[sighs]

40:28.362 --> 40:31.569
I know I wasn't there for you
in ways I should've been.

40:33.338 --> 40:34.836
You deserved better.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.578
But enough's enough,
don't you think?

40:42.080 --> 40:43.515

[laughs] May I?

41:08.669 --> 41:11.741
[insects chirping]

41:18.748 --> 41:20.816
You can put your arms down now.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.660
It's from back in the day

41:31.796 --> 41:34.595
when she could not
shut up about it.

41:34.730 --> 41:36.296
I thought she was a lesbian.

41:36.432 --> 41:37.899
She is.

41:38.734 --> 41:41.399
It's some sort of joke.

41:41.535 --> 41:42.970
Oh.

41:43.769 --> 41:45.474
Well...

41:45.609 --> 41:47.944
at least he's not naked anymore.

41:48.413 --> 41:50.608
I'm not sure myself

41:50.743 --> 41:52.683
that he was.

41:53.217 --> 41:54.278
Oh.

41:55.884 --> 41:58.882
I also thought it might be nice

41:59.017 --> 42:00.857
if we gave him a name.

42:00.992 --> 42:03.628
Do you think that's necessary?
He's just here.

42:03.763 --> 42:05.663
I don't see the need
to call him anything.

42:05.799 --> 42:10.034
Well, for instance,
when we talk about him.

42:10.870 --> 42:14.402
-What do you suggest?
-Well, I had an idea.

42:14.538 --> 42:16.905
And it just feels right.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.244
You think we can call him Jules?

42:20.379 --> 42:22.579
Good as anything else.

42:22.715 --> 42:24.478
But I'm not gonna
call him anything.

42:24.613 --> 42:25.913
If he's just here,

42:26.048 --> 42:28.587
then I don't need
to call him anything.

-Would you like to join?
-I seen the alien.

43:46.096 --> 43:49.701
Oh, my goodness,
it's a goddamn extraterrestrial.

43:51.232 --> 43:53.198
I had a feeling
you weren't lying.

43:53.334 --> 43:55.636
I knew you were slipping
but not that fast.

43:55.772 --> 43:57.370
Why were you spying on us?

43:57.506 --> 44:00.104
I thought it was odd the two
of you hanging out together.

44:00.239 --> 44:02.274
You shouldn't have spied on us.

44:03.748 --> 44:06.718
His eyes are so understanding.

44:09.115 --> 44:11.116
-May I touch him?
-Hey!

44:11.252 --> 44:12.922
She shouldn't know!
This is a secret.

44:13.057 --> 44:15.255
-She-- she shouldn't know!
-Guys, calm down.

44:15.391 --> 44:17.823
Just, everybody, calm down.
You're scaring Jules.

44:17.958 --> 44:19.256
Jules? He's no Jules.

44:19.392 --> 44:23.498
He's more of a Gary
or-- or a Naomi.

44:23.633 --> 44:25.033
His name is Jules,

44:25.168 --> 44:27.235
and listen, Milton,
she's in on it now, okay?

44:27.371 --> 44:30.068
So we got to trust her.
There's nothing else we can do.

44:30.203 --> 44:31.906
-We could kill her.
-Kill me?

44:32.042 --> 44:33.744
You can't kill me.
I'll kill you.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.945
-That's what I'll do!
-Guys, stop it!

he's not dangerous?

-We just know!

44:41.283 --> 44:43.788
Okay, okay,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

to tell you something.

He's not trying
to tell me something.

47:31.150 --> 47:32.583

Away in the Big City,
you can find all the pleasure

01:04:32.139 --> 01:04:33.203
Those look like agents.

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:35.942
L-- like government agents?

01:04:36.077 --> 01:04:37.679
Like the ones in the movies.

01:04:37.814 --> 01:04:39.510
I'll take Jules upstairs.

01:05:19.688 --> 01:05:20.952
Okay.

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:22.251
We've gotta act quickly,

01:05:22.387 --> 01:05:23.618
'cause any moment we waste

01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:25.591
is a moment
they can discover him.

01:05:25.726 --> 01:05:28.425
-We can both go out driving.
-That'll take too long.

01:05:28.561 --> 01:05:30.161
And besides,
I looked everywhere.

01:05:30.297 --> 01:05:31.593
Well, short of killing a cat,

01:05:31.729 --> 01:05:33.636
I don't know
how we're gonna do it.

01:05:33.772 --> 01:05:35.104
Well, what about yours?

01:05:37.772 --> 01:05:38.972
Henry?

01:05:39.107 --> 01:05:40.639
The hell you talking about?

01:05:40.774 --> 01:05:44.273
You said he doesn't hear,
he doesn't see, he can't walk.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:46.115
He's pretty much dead.

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:51.549
Well, he's not dead.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.126
He's like my child.

01:05:59.258 --> 01:06:01.394
You can go fuck yourself!

I'm sorry
about what Milton said.

01:06:32.995 --> 01:06:34.460
He spoke out of turn.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:41.170
Henry's been there
every time I've come home.

01:06:42.772 --> 01:06:44.140
No one else has.

01:06:45.236 --> 01:06:46.335
Of course.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:47.976
Pets may just be pets,

01:06:48.111 --> 01:06:51.477
but they're part of the family.

01:06:54.951 --> 01:06:56.250
I watched him get worse,

01:06:56.386 --> 01:06:58.550
and I just
didn't do anything about it.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:02.921
I was too afraid
of what it would be like

01:07:03.056 --> 01:07:04.325
without him.

01:07:07.126 --> 01:07:08.725
He's all I have.

01:07:13.564 --> 01:07:15.105
Do you know it's been a year

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.734
since he was able to
walk up to me on his own?

01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:23.377
Milton's right.

01:07:25.113 --> 01:07:26.611
He's not all I have.

01:07:28.819 --> 01:07:30.186
He's all I had.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.731
All right, go ahead. [sniffles]

01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.399
Let's do this.

01:07:47.068 --> 01:07:48.064
Explode his head.

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:49.469

Jules, I'm--

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.013
I'm so happy for you.

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:30.488
I brought you something.

01:11:30.624 --> 01:11:32.827
It's a snow globe of the city.

01:11:32.962 --> 01:11:37.367
It's a typical gift that you get
when you're in some place new.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:39.796
It's, uh--
it kind of means a lot to me,

01:11:39.932 --> 01:11:41.899
reminds me
of my time in the city.

01:11:43.437 --> 01:11:44.770
I want you to have it.

01:11:47.711 --> 01:11:51.107
[Sandy] I, uh--
I brought you something too.

01:11:51.242 --> 01:11:55.518
I don't know if it gets cold
where you're from,

01:11:55.653 --> 01:11:59.389
but you maybe,
you can get some use out of it.

01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:02.788
Oh, not now.

01:12:04.257 --> 01:12:05.527
Later.

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.433
I didn't know
we were giving gifts.

01:12:13.031 --> 01:12:15.603
So you don't forget
what I look like.

01:12:26.678 --> 01:12:27.910
[Sandy] What was that?

01:12:28.046 --> 01:12:29.947
[Joyce] Did he just
do something?

01:12:37.425 --> 01:12:39.121
I think he's inviting us.

[soft instrumental playing]

01:12:56.177 --> 01:12:57.447
I'll go.

I'd like to go with you.

01:13:08.955 --> 01:13:11.586
Milton. You can't.
You've got Denise.

[Sandy] Felt
like just a few seconds.

I've got four bars
and a text message.

I think we're still on Earth.

01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:17.273
I think he just stopped to--

01:16:18.414 --> 01:16:19.748
to drop us off.

01:16:20.518 --> 01:16:22.113

01:16:28.357 --> 01:16:29.418
Well, Jules.

01:16:30.521 --> 01:16:33.322
I guess it's time
for your intergalactic journey.

01:16:36.298 --> 01:16:39.168
If they didn't need me
to keep this town on the rails,

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:40.802
I'd come with you.

01:16:54.284 --> 01:16:55.850
And Milton?

01:17:04.027 --> 01:17:06.921
I'm so thankful
for your invitation to join you.

01:17:07.524 --> 01:17:10.227
And I know
I would have enjoyed very much

01:17:10.362 --> 01:17:12.499
journeying with you
through the heavens,

01:17:12.634 --> 01:17:13.967
and seeing your home.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:20.039
But I've lived
on this planet all my life.

01:17:21.444 --> 01:17:22.712
It's my home.

01:17:24.548 --> 01:17:25.913
Doesn't stop being that

01:17:26.048 --> 01:17:28.245
just 'cause
I'm getting ready to leave it.

01:17:30.447 --> 01:17:32.755
What's coming
probably won't be fun.

01:17:34.756 --> 01:17:36.220
But I ought to do it here.

01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:52.973

Don't you think
he's been to other planets?

Don't you think
he's met other life forms?
