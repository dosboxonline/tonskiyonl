(Happy Birthday, Yuu-chan)

01:13.880 --> 01:16.220
This is the police! Yamashita-san!

01:18.590 --> 01:21.220
Yamashita-san! Are you there?

01:27.650 --> 01:29.650
The upper floors have been evacuated.

01:30.110 --> 01:32.150
What's the situation? 501 isn't at home, right?

01:32.150 --> 01:35.490
I've got his number. Let me try calling.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.500
(Higashikata Ryohei, Head Patrol Officer)

01:49.630 --> 01:52.840
Higashikata...Ryohei...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.050
Yamashita-san?

01:57.590 --> 01:58.380
Yamashita-san!

01:59.510 --> 02:01.260
Yamashita-san! I know you're in there!

02:05.850 --> 02:06.850
Yamashita-san!

02:21.870 --> 02:23.830
Katagiri!

02:42.890 --> 02:44.430
Who the heck are you?

02:49.370 --> 02:50.730
Stop it!

03:05.330 --> 03:07.410
Gravity brings us together.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.290
Gravity meaning love.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.630
Comradeship.

03:22.090 --> 03:23.640
Congratulations.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.930
You've been chosen.

03:57.630 --> 03:59.630
Come on, it's time to talk.

04:00.090 --> 04:01.090
Katagiri.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.010
Just how many people have you killed already?

04:10.270 --> 04:11.430
Katagiri!

04:29.450 --> 04:30.660
What is this?!

05:02.510 --> 05:06.180
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable

05:07.390 --> 05:11.140
Chapter 1

05:07.430 --> 05:11.140
(subbed by yamazaki-kento com)

05:11.260 --> 05:16.350
("Pink Dark Boy" by Kishibe Rohan)

05:29.050 --> 05:30.090
I'm leaving.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.930
Be careful of the cars, okay?

05:31.930 --> 05:32.890
Okay!

05:33.680 --> 05:35.850
We're reporting from a crime scene in Morioh-cho.

05:35.850 --> 05:37.560
According to reports that just came in,

05:37.730 --> 05:41.060
the internal organs of the deceased male were horribly ruptured.

05:41.190 --> 05:47.070
The police are investigating this as part of a series of
recent strange deaths happening in Morioh-cho.

06:00.250 --> 06:03.590
I'm Hirose Koichi, a second year high school student

06:04.380 --> 06:07.380
Three days ago, I moved in to this town, Morioh-cho.

06:07.840 --> 06:12.930
This commuter suburb flourished rapidly over the past 10 years,

06:13.060 --> 06:15.640
is blessed with lush mountains and a bountiful sea,

06:15.770 --> 06:18.600
and lined with many historical buildings.

06:19.060 --> 06:21.560
According to the national census taken last year,

06:21.650 --> 06:25.440
the population of this town is 58,713.

06:26.110 --> 06:31.110
For the past two years, this area has been voted
the place that people most want to live in.

06:33.950 --> 06:36.950
But it might be difficult to make it three years in a row.

06:37.450 --> 06:39.290
In fact, in this Morioh-cho,

06:39.460 --> 06:42.580
there have been frequent occurrence of murders and disappearances.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.280
A murder suspect escaped during interrogation.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.300
Good morning! - Good morning

06:46.300 --> 06:47.800
He's still on the loose.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.800
For peace-loving person like me, this really bothers me.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.850
A new day begins.

06:57.020 --> 07:01.140
What kind of friends will I meet? What kind of adventure awaits me?

07:01.560 --> 07:02.810
I can't wait!

07:08.820 --> 07:11.530
Are you a student from Budo?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.360
Yes.

07:16.490 --> 07:18.660
If you'd like to pass through, that's 5,000 yen.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.170
Well, no, then it's okay.

07:25.630 --> 07:28.460
If you're going back, it's 10,000 yen.

08:07.590 --> 08:08.840
Hey!

08:10.550 --> 08:11.920
Wait!

08:15.390 --> 08:16.720
Yes?

08:17.430 --> 08:20.060
You bumped into me just now, right?

08:20.890 --> 08:22.890
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.690
Hey hey. Don't just go like that.

08:27.810 --> 08:30.400
Nobody has forgiven you! You with that ugly hair!

08:33.030 --> 08:35.200
What's with that weird hair of yours?

08:41.370 --> 08:42.580
Hey!

08:43.909 --> 08:47.210
What did you just say about my hair?!

08:55.880 --> 08:58.470
Eh, what just happened?

08:58.600 --> 09:00.760
He didn't do anything, but that guy flew.

09:08.060 --> 09:11.270
Anyone who insults my hair...

09:11.900 --> 09:13.940
will not get away with it.

09:14.610 --> 09:15.440
Okay.

09:17.820 --> 09:18.740
I...I... I'm sorry.

09:18.780 --> 09:19.280
I...I... I'm sorry.

09:19.320 --> 09:19.740
I'm sorry.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.640
Higashikata-kun?

09:45.140 --> 09:47.520
Higashikata Josuke-kun, right?

09:49.900 --> 09:51.020
I am...

09:51.320 --> 09:54.980
Remember? I'm Hirose Koichi, who transferred here yesterday.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.030
Are you?

10:03.870 --> 10:07.040
Oh... You don't remember...

10:25.430 --> 10:27.180
It's broken...

10:28.020 --> 10:30.730
But you were awesome just now.

10:30.900 --> 10:34.360
You moved too fast. l couldn't see anything.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.780
Did I?

10:36.940 --> 10:38.150
You did.

10:50.330 --> 10:59.220
(Budogaoka High School)

11:26.120 --> 11:27.620
Yukako-san.

11:29.290 --> 11:33.120
Koichi-kun, how's your English revision? Can you manage?

11:33.250 --> 11:35.130
Oh, well..

11:36.170 --> 11:38.460
Here. This is my homework for you.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.280
(For Hirose Koichi-kun's Use)

11:39.970 --> 11:41.300
For today.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.760
Homework given by you?

11:49.600 --> 11:53.640
If your results aren't good, I'll be held responsible.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.650
My pride wouldn't allow that.

12:01.450 --> 12:02.780
Thank you.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.360
I'll do my best.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.340
She is Yamagishi Yukako-san.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.220
She's been told to look out for me who've just transferred over.

12:27.350 --> 12:30.010
And she's taking it really seriously.

12:44.070 --> 12:47.700
I've...to do all of this...today?

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
You are so pretty.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.420
Don't go, wait.

13:02.550 --> 13:03.670
Come over to my place?

13:06.550 --> 13:08.430
She's totally hot.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.720
I thought we had a chance.

13:13.390 --> 13:16.730
Hey, dispose of your rubbish properly.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.270
Come on!

13:21.570 --> 13:23.730
What the... You're annoying.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.530
Yoshizawa Masaya.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.580
I heard you quit another job?

13:31.740 --> 13:34.330
So what? That's got nothing to do with a patrol officer.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.500
You're really nosy.

13:37.420 --> 13:39.960
It's my job to be nosy.

13:40.590 --> 13:42.250
To protect the citizens,

13:42.590 --> 13:45.050
and to show them the right path.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.760
If you need me, call me anytime.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.300
I'm OK 24 hours a day.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.560
Don't worry. I won't make trouble for you again.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.280
Don't fool around with me.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.960
What is it?

14:24.250 --> 14:25.460
Hirata!

14:27.800 --> 14:29.800
What's wrong with you? Hey!

14:38.980 --> 14:40.480
Then, what's the opposite of that?

14:40.650 --> 14:41.980
Negative.

14:42.150 --> 14:45.610
Negative. Then, what's the opposite of that.

14:45.690 --> 14:48.110
What? Eh, erm...positive.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.990
Good.

14:52.030 --> 14:53.990
Oh, JoJo-sempai!

14:53.990 --> 14:55.030
We're lucky!

14:55.040 --> 14:56.700
Let's walk home together, JoJo-sempai

14:56.830 --> 14:59.160
Your hair is as cool as ever today.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.420
JoJo sempai, you're the best.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.170
Oh, is that so?

15:04.340 --> 15:05.340
Yes, you are!

15:05.500 --> 15:07.170
Are you going straight home today?

15:08.170 --> 15:09.470
JoJo?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.680
Josuke's "Jo",

15:11.840 --> 15:13.840
and "suke" can be read as 'jo' too, right?

15:14.550 --> 15:16.180
That's why it s "JoJo'.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.890
Koichi-kun, you don't like Higashikata-kun too, right?

15:24.020 --> 15:27.520
I know it. You are that type of person.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.690
No, well, it's not that...

15:29.690 --> 15:31.200
Don't worry.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.370
If he bullies you, tell me immediately.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.700
I'll protect you then.

15:37.830 --> 15:38.910
Okay.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.590
See you.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.420
Remember to do your homework.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.050
Okay.

16:19.290 --> 16:20.740
Thank you very much.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.540
Thank you

16:23.370 --> 16:24.710
Sir?

16:33.930 --> 16:35.470
Give me the money.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.480
Stay away!

16:47.060 --> 16:49.020
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

16:50.940 --> 16:53.780
What are you looking at? Stay the hell away!

16:54.450 --> 16:56.490
His eyes are totally messed up.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.570
Get lost! You're an eyesore!

16:58.660 --> 17:00.950
Out of my way! Damn it!

17:01.080 --> 17:02.450
Sorry.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.619
I'll leave, I'll leave.

17:05.210 --> 17:07.579
Damn you and your stupid hair!

17:12.300 --> 17:13.420
What?

17:13.630 --> 17:15.170
You must be kidding!

17:16.470 --> 17:17.800
You bastard!

17:18.640 --> 17:20.800
What did you just say!?!

17:21.010 --> 17:22.970
What the hell you want?!

17:23.140 --> 17:25.180
Stay away, you moron!

17:26.940 --> 17:30.940
You said "stupid hair", didn't you!?!

17:30.940 --> 17:32.860
Don't mess with me, you moron!

17:33.820 --> 17:36.860
Ahh it's coming to my head now...

17:37.610 --> 17:40.320
I'm gonna stick this knife into this woman here!

18:02.890 --> 18:03.850
What?

18:09.850 --> 18:11.060
What is this?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.820
You'll have it removed by a surgeon!

18:14.360 --> 18:16.530
At the prison hospital!

18:38.090 --> 18:39.550
Move it! Out of the way!

18:39.590 --> 18:41.050
Out of the way! Make way!

18:41.220 --> 18:41.930
Out of the way!

18:42.890 --> 18:44.100
Crap.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.730
How dare you get in my way.

18:54.230 --> 18:57.280
Fine. You're next

18:58.530 --> 19:00.740
I'll ruin you.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.620
Oh, Dad!

19:25.260 --> 19:27.390
Ouch!

19:28.270 --> 19:29.770
What are you doing, Grandpa!?!

19:29.890 --> 19:31.440
Was it you, Josuke?

19:31.600 --> 19:32.440
What?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.020
The high school student at the convenience store!

19:37.440 --> 19:41.110
I heard you approached the culprit who held a lady as hostage!

19:41.780 --> 19:44.110
Well...it's not like that.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.410
What if the hostage got hurt?!

19:46.490 --> 19:50.450
She's fine, don t worry. Nothing happened

19:50.790 --> 19:51.250
Idiot!

19:51.250 --> 19:52.660
Ouch!!!

19:54.290 --> 19:56.130
What are you doing? You violent cop!

19:56.290 --> 19:58.920
Listen! A high school student should act like one, and

19:59.010 --> 20:01.630
Focus on studies and sports, right?

20:01.970 --> 20:03.260
Yeah.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.850
Dad, welcome home. You're early.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.310
Yeah.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.930
I'm heading back later. Will sleep over tonight.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.020
Another incident?

20:13.520 --> 20:15.190
Robbery at the convenience store.

20:15.310 --> 20:16.980
It was scary~

20:17.150 --> 20:20.980
Josuke, he isn't someone who would do something like that.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
Something must have happened. I'm sure.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.540
Grandpa...

21:02.820 --> 21:05.320
What am I doing?

21:10.160 --> 21:11.540
Don't mess with me!

21:12.500 --> 21:14.040
Do it or die?

21:15.960 --> 21:19.710
Who would work their hearts out for such a stupid company!

21:25.130 --> 21:25.670
All of you...

21:26.800 --> 21:29.850
don't even know how great I am...

21:32.220 --> 21:33.640
What is it?

21:42.690 --> 21:45.030
Do you hate them so much?

21:47.030 --> 21:49.070
Or were you humiliated?

21:50.740 --> 21:53.040
Will you be able....

21:54.370 --> 21:58.040
to turn those feelings into something powerful?

22:07.050 --> 22:08.840
What a pity.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.560
You didn't have it in you.

22:22.110 --> 22:23.520
It's Josuke-kun!

22:41.250 --> 22:42.420
Are you alright?

22:44.860 --> 22:46.690
(Kujo Jotaro)

22:45.460 --> 22:47.210
I'm sorry I didn't see you.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.550
Are you a student from Budogaoka High School?

22:52.390 --> 22:53.470
Yes.

22:54.430 --> 22:58.140
Then, do you know Higashikata Josuke?

22:58.680 --> 23:00.020
Josuke-kun!

23:03.150 --> 23:04.440
Oh, transfer student!

23:06.150 --> 23:06.940
That person said he wants to talk to you.

23:06.940 --> 23:08.900
That person said he wants to talk to you.

23:16.450 --> 23:17.620
Higashikata Josuke.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.620
Your mother's name is Tomoko.

23:22.830 --> 23:26.000
Your father's name is Joseph Joestar.

23:27.960 --> 23:31.630
They knew each other when your mother was in university.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.430
And you were born after they broke up.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.260
Forgive him.

23:38.020 --> 23:41.980
Joseph only knew of your existence recently.

23:43.650 --> 23:46.270
I'm Joseph's grandson, Kujo Jotaro.

23:46.820 --> 23:50.360
It's bizarre, but technically I'm your nephew.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.700
Nephew?

23:53.990 --> 23:57.160
I am your uncle...

23:59.830 --> 24:02.000
Okay. Nice to meet you.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.050
Joseph is 79 years old. He's still healthy,

24:11.510 --> 24:15.220
but one day you will be getting a third of his inheritance.

24:16.010 --> 24:21.680
Of course, news of his affair created an uproar within the Joestar family

24:25.060 --> 24:27.310
An uproar?

24:28.820 --> 24:29.690
Yes.

24:30.150 --> 24:34.400
In 61 years of marriage, my grandmother has never been angrier.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.040
I'm sorry! Because of me, there was an uproar.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.250
Wait a minute.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.870
Why are you apologizing out of the blue?

24:45.750 --> 24:47.250
Well...

24:47.420 --> 24:50.920
Indeed it's bad to cause trouble to your family.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.090
My mother said she gave birth to me because she was truly in love.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.390
I'm also okay with that.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.060
I have a grandfather,

25:01.180 --> 25:03.390
and the three of us are living happily.

25:05.270 --> 25:08.270
So, please tell him not to take it to heart...

25:08.690 --> 25:12.230
Tell erm... my father?

25:12.740 --> 25:14.530
Please tell Joestar-san that.

25:15.950 --> 25:17.450
That's all I've to say.

25:18.700 --> 25:21.200
Wait. I'm not done yet.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.040
Josuke.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.790
Do you see strange things?

25:30.290 --> 25:31.750
I mean...

25:32.260 --> 25:34.970
For example, evil spirits...

25:35.630 --> 25:37.090
Or something like that.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.260
You can see them, right?

25:43.310 --> 25:45.890
Josuke-kun, are you done with the talk?

25:45.980 --> 25:49.440
Oh, JoJo-sempai, there's something on your hair.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.610
- I'll take it off for you.
-No! You will mess up his hair.

25:52.730 --> 25:55.240
- I'll take it off.
- No, I will do it.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.650
No, I will do it.

25:56.820 --> 25:57.900
Hey!

25:58.820 --> 26:00.910
Leave your stupid hair talk till later.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.500
You bastard...

26:13.630 --> 26:15.300
Please apologize quickly!

26:15.300 --> 26:18.010
Josuke-kun will get angry if people insult his hair!

26:18.010 --> 26:19.880
I didn't insult you at all.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.350
This is bad. His Stand is coming.

26:29.690 --> 26:32.650
What? What just happened?

26:32.940 --> 26:34.520
I couldn't see anything.

26:35.110 --> 26:36.860
Can you see this, Josuke?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.780
This is called a Stand.

26:40.320 --> 26:44.370
Stands can only be seen by Stand users.

26:44.540 --> 26:48.160
I don't care about Stand or whatever this thing is called!

26:48.660 --> 26:53.210
But how dare you insult my super fantastic hairdo!

26:53.340 --> 26:56.630
Good grief. This guy is really dangerous.

27:00.970 --> 27:01.680
What?

27:16.230 --> 27:18.030
Eh, when did that happen?

27:18.150 --> 27:19.190
JoJo-sempai!

27:19.360 --> 27:20.200
Are you alright!?

27:20.360 --> 27:21.990
Shut up!

27:22.320 --> 27:25.030
Noisy women get on my nerves.

27:27.370 --> 27:28.700
Okay.

27:29.540 --> 27:31.040
Sorry.

27:36.210 --> 27:40.170
This cap... has it been fixed?

27:40.720 --> 27:42.220
What's this Stand about?

27:43.220 --> 27:44.430
About that Stand...

27:44.550 --> 27:45.890
Enough.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.230
I don't want to listen.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.940
I saw something like that yesterday too.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.610
Then, what did you do?

27:59.780 --> 28:01.440
I didn't do anything.

28:02.450 --> 28:04.780
I'm not interested in such stuff.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.410
At all.

28:09.290 --> 28:10.450
Bye.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.470
Hey Grandpa.

28:24.930 --> 28:27.430
Josuke already witnessed the Stand in this town.

28:29.890 --> 28:30.890
You're right.

28:32.350 --> 28:34.640
A crisis may be approaching this town.

29:11.310 --> 29:13.180
I sensed you too.

29:14.850 --> 29:16.980
Yeah, we re comrades.

29:28.990 --> 29:31.030
How did you get hold of that bow and arrow?

29:32.290 --> 29:33.870
That's none of your business.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.380
If that's the case, I'll do whatever I want.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.550
I won't forgive anyone who gets in my way.

29:47.130 --> 29:49.140
Did someone get in your way?

29:50.970 --> 29:54.220
Yeah, a high school kid.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.560
That fella was trying to act hero.

30:01.730 --> 30:03.730
I'll make sure he's dead.

30:33.220 --> 30:35.220
Even towards your own father...

30:36.770 --> 30:39.060
Did you stab him because he got in your way?

30:41.770 --> 30:43.110
Yes.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.940
It's all that guy's fault that I've become like this.

30:47.070 --> 30:49.400
I had nothing but hatred for that guy.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.910
How about you?

30:55.370 --> 30:57.120
Do you hate your parents?

30:59.920 --> 31:00.750
Just say it.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.790
I'll finish them off for you anytime.

31:14.430 --> 31:15.930
I was joking!

31:17.100 --> 31:18.430
I was joking.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.280
I won't oppose you.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.950
You're the one who gave me this freedom.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.570
It's your destiny.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.830
Do as you please.

31:42.830 --> 31:44.670
What are you trying to achieve?

32:02.520 --> 32:05.610
Josuke! You're putting too much salt.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.650
Here, Grandpa.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.990
Dad too, you're putting too much salt!

32:11.150 --> 32:12.280
Is that so?

32:13.990 --> 32:14.860
It's blend, isn't it?

32:15.030 --> 32:15.820
Yeah.

32:15.820 --> 32:16.820
Is that so?

32:16.830 --> 32:18.160
But it's delicious.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.200
I'm glad to hear that.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.880
To end a day like this...

32:30.010 --> 32:34.220
with my daughter and grandson, drinking delicious wine...

32:37.010 --> 32:40.850
The only thing missing in this town is peace.

32:42.350 --> 32:43.520
Hey.

32:44.190 --> 32:46.810
Will Morioh-cho really be fine?

32:47.690 --> 32:51.570
Don't worry. Things will be sorted out soon

32:52.360 --> 32:53.740
Is that so?

32:54.860 --> 32:57.530
Believe in the people of this town.

32:57.660 --> 33:00.740
Few are truly evil to the core.

33:01.870 --> 33:04.410
Oh, I'd expect you to say something like this.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.250
Josuke, you too.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.010
You should be grateful that you're alive and safe now.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.720
I know.

33:17.930 --> 33:21.060
You were at the brink of death when you were four.

33:21.180 --> 33:23.270
But now you're alive and healthy.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.400
Your life was saved.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.280
Yeah.

33:41.290 --> 33:43.620
It's been 13 years since then.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.710
Dad, you're bringing that up again?

33:49.590 --> 33:51.250
You're drinking too much.

33:51.750 --> 33:53.300
Silly.

33:54.050 --> 33:56.590
This much wine wouldn't make me drunk.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.150
But Grandpa has been working too much recently.

34:13.480 --> 34:17.489
He's doing his best to protect the people of this town.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.170
Hey.

34:35.510 --> 34:38.510
Mom, are you fine with not getting married?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.800
Why are you asking this suddenly?

34:42.429 --> 34:46.679
It's fine. I have no interest in men at all.

34:48.810 --> 34:52.770
I only have one lover in my entire life.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.940
Your father.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.490
Was he that good a guy?

35:03.620 --> 35:05.870
He's a fine man, you know.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.370
Oh yes.

35:09.330 --> 35:11.870
Perhaps you have also come to look like him.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.170
I don't know about that.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.010
I've never met him before anyway.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.220
If I were to look like anyone...

35:22.890 --> 35:24.470
It'd be Grandpa.

35:26.470 --> 35:27.720
That's true.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.900
It's Josuke-kun!

35:39.860 --> 35:41.400
Good morning, Koichi-kun!

35:43.200 --> 35:44.410
Good morning!

35:47.200 --> 35:50.910
Then, let's check your homework. A review of English, okay?

35:53.880 --> 35:54.920
Okay.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.050
Hey.

36:05.180 --> 36:08.060
Do you notice anything about me?

36:08.220 --> 36:09.270
What?

36:10.600 --> 36:13.730
Something about me changed, right?

36:15.400 --> 36:19.280
Ehhh... I wonder what has changed....

36:20.240 --> 36:21.440
Your hair!

36:22.070 --> 36:23.740
It's the same as yesterday.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.620
Your eyes!

36:28.790 --> 36:30.120
Your nose!

36:31.210 --> 36:32.580
Your lips!

36:36.130 --> 36:38.420
You really can't tell?

36:49.890 --> 36:51.220
Your nails!

36:52.390 --> 36:55.140
Your nails are very beautiful.

36:55.940 --> 36:59.150
Koichi-kun! You noticed it!

37:00.940 --> 37:02.110
That's right.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.240
I polished my nails with a file for so many hours.

37:05.610 --> 37:06.490
Then...

37:06.990 --> 37:10.620
I used an expensive special cream to make them Shine.

37:12.500 --> 37:17.250
I believed that you'd be able to notice everything about me.

37:33.980 --> 37:36.020
Geez, Koichi-kun.

37:36.190 --> 37:37.900
You really need me to take care of you.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.220
Katagiri Anjuro.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.720
Also known as Angelo.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.690
He has killed at least seven people to date,

38:18.850 --> 38:21.060
and came close 13 times.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.690
His very first victim...

38:24.150 --> 38:25.480
was his father.

38:27.240 --> 38:30.030
After his escape, six strange deaths occurred.

38:30.570 --> 38:34.330
All the victims died from ruptured organs.

38:35.580 --> 38:41.170
It's as though something had attacked them
from inside the body, not the outside.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.260
Found you.

38:48.930 --> 38:51.430
The public toilet, the sea shore,

38:52.260 --> 38:54.220
the fountain in the park...

38:56.890 --> 38:59.560
The killings always happened near water.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.070
That's the characteristic of his Stand.

39:14.790 --> 39:16.410
Don't tell me...

39:16.750 --> 39:18.450
Angelo is...

39:18.790 --> 39:19.960
I'm home.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.130
Grandpa...

39:48.110 --> 39:50.440
What's wrong, Josuke?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.660
What was that sound just now?

39:54.320 --> 39:56.160
Oh... Sorry.

39:56.330 --> 39:58.620
I dropped this.

40:02.290 --> 40:04.330
Don't overdo it, Grandpa!

40:04.500 --> 40:06.130
Your arms are wobbling now.

40:06.250 --> 40:10.590
Don't be silly. If I don't train up, how am I going to protect the town?

40:11.130 --> 40:14.470
Ninety...eight.

40:14.590 --> 40:18.470
Ninety...nine.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.690
One hundred!

40:30.860 --> 40:34.530
I'll protect, and save the people of this town.

40:34.950 --> 40:36.530
That's the way I live.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.830
There you go again. Give me a break.

40:39.950 --> 40:42.870
Don't say that. The "Jo" in "Josuke" means...

40:43.040 --> 40:45.460
Give me a break, I said.

40:45.540 --> 40:46.710
Forget it.

40:46.880 --> 40:49.500
I do my thing, and you do yours.

41:07.110 --> 41:09.860
(Higashikata Ryohei)

41:11.400 --> 41:13.530
Yamashita-san! I know you're in there!

41:16.870 --> 41:18.910
Katagiri!

41:19.080 --> 41:21.200
He's the cop from that time?

41:24.540 --> 41:26.040
Interesting.

41:34.760 --> 41:38.930
Well then... There s no escaping me.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.690
Go, Aqua Necklace.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.110
Kill the entire family.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.120
Did something happen to Dad?

42:05.790 --> 42:08.710
Nothing. He's an old man made of steel!

42:09.630 --> 42:11.130
That's true.

42:23.850 --> 42:26.680
Are you going out? It's raining, you know.

42:28.190 --> 42:31.650
Trussardi. It's a really nice Italian restaurant I found.

42:32.110 --> 42:35.150
Oh yes, Josuke, why don t you come together with me?

42:43.830 --> 42:47.000
What is it? You don't have to look at me like that.

42:55.010 --> 42:57.840
Are you going? Or not?

42:57.990 --> 43:00.180
No, I'm cool.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.850
Oh, what a pity.

43:03.010 --> 43:05.560
I thought we could go on a date once in a while

43:05.890 --> 43:07.350
What was that?

43:07.850 --> 43:09.100
Alright, I'm going then.

43:09.230 --> 43:11.190
Oh, I haven't prepared the bath.

43:11.350 --> 43:13.190
No worries I'll do it

43:13.360 --> 43:14.520
Hurry, just go.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.070
Really?

43:16.530 --> 43:17.900
Thanks!

43:44.600 --> 43:45.850
Is that Jotaro-san?

43:46.060 --> 43:47.010
Josuke?

43:48.060 --> 43:50.230
Sorry I missed your call.

43:50.390 --> 43:51.730
I've something to tell you.

43:51.810 --> 43:52.940
Me too.

43:53.230 --> 43:57.070
Was it called a Stand? Seems like I've caught one.

43:57.150 --> 43:58.070
What?

43:58.740 --> 44:00.570
The one I talked about yesterday.

44:00.820 --> 44:04.570
This time, he entered my mother's mouth.

44:04.740 --> 44:06.580
And you caught it?

44:06.990 --> 44:10.580
Yes. I captured him in a bottle.

44:11.250 --> 44:12.750
I'll go over to your house now.

44:12.830 --> 44:15.420
Until I'm there, keep a close watch on that guy.

44:17.090 --> 44:19.300
I won't let you get away!

44:19.420 --> 44:23.260
That guy is kinda bossy, even though he's my nephew.

44:30.980 --> 44:32.810
Stop it, you brat!

44:44.450 --> 44:46.280
I'll make sure you're dead.

44:55.380 --> 44:56.460
What's wrong?

44:56.540 --> 44:57.670
Crap.

44:57.790 --> 44:59.670
I forgot to prepare the bath.

45:00.380 --> 45:01.800
I'll do it now.

45:02.470 --> 45:04.680
It's okay, take your time.

45:12.230 --> 45:15.190
Eh? Where is the other one?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.500
It must be Tomoko.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.090
Thank you.

45:48.340 --> 45:49.510
Alright.

45:57.900 --> 45:59.270
What the heck?

45:59.520 --> 46:01.400
Are you aiming to be a bodybuilder?

46:06.200 --> 46:07.910
Oh geez.

46:21.210 --> 46:22.540
Grandpa!

46:27.510 --> 46:28.220
Grandpa!

46:28.300 --> 46:29.300
Josuke!

46:30.470 --> 46:31.350
Josuke!

46:33.180 --> 46:35.520
Grandpa drank from the bottle.

46:35.930 --> 46:37.560
But not to worry.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.560
It's only a small wound...

46:40.060 --> 46:42.230
I can easily heal such a wound.

46:59.580 --> 47:00.920
See?

47:01.580 --> 47:03.920
Come on, you're all good now. Grandpa!

47:31.110 --> 47:33.660
Hey who the heck are you?

47:34.870 --> 47:37.040
Oh, you can hear me?

47:38.160 --> 47:39.790
Don't tell me you're also...

47:39.960 --> 47:40.960
Angelo!

47:41.460 --> 47:43.290
This is your Stand, huh.

47:44.380 --> 47:45.380
Never mind.

47:46.460 --> 47:48.380
I'll deal with you first.

48:12.490 --> 48:13.820
You bastard...

48:15.410 --> 48:18.330
You aren't getting away with this.

48:19.580 --> 48:20.660
Oh no~

48:54.200 --> 48:56.700
What the heck. What just happened?

48:59.200 --> 49:00.580
But it's pointless.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.870
You can't defeat me.

49:04.710 --> 49:08.540
Stopping time. That's my Stand's power.

49:10.090 --> 49:11.710
Calm down, Josuke.

49:12.380 --> 49:15.720
It's raining outside. He's free to do whatever he wants.

49:18.930 --> 49:22.100
What will happen to you if he enters your body?

49:23.430 --> 49:25.640
Your can't heal your own wounds.

49:25.770 --> 49:26.980
Am I right?

49:29.400 --> 49:30.570
Yeah.

49:31.150 --> 49:32.780
I guess I will die

49:34.400 --> 49:36.950
But I am very calm.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.660
Totally calm.

49:41.620 --> 49:45.120
Just that a little blood has rushed to my head.

49:58.090 --> 49:59.590
Stay away from the steam.

50:00.300 --> 50:02.100
Don't inhale it.

50:02.930 --> 50:04.850
He is within the steam.

50:37.050 --> 50:38.470
The bath.

50:44.850 --> 50:47.890
There's nowhere you can run to.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.650
Josuke.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.230
How would you slip us out of this?

50:54.860 --> 50:56.400
Slip us out?

50:58.200 --> 50:59.400
You're wrong.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.830
I'll smash us out!

51:13.670 --> 51:16.090
That will keep the steam out for now.

51:41.410 --> 51:42.910
Jotaro-san, this is bad.

51:43.780 --> 51:46.370
This room is filled with invisible mist.

51:51.870 --> 51:53.710
I've won, Josuke.

51:54.420 --> 51:56.920
Indeed you were going to smash through that wall.

52:00.720 --> 52:03.390
You did exactly what I predicted.

52:03.550 --> 52:06.390
I really want to laugh my guts out.

52:11.190 --> 52:12.060
Josuke!

52:14.190 --> 52:18.150
Even if I did exactly what you predicted,

52:21.490 --> 52:23.280
what's coming out of my guts...

52:23.780 --> 52:25.450
isn't laughter!

52:38.210 --> 52:40.380
What did you do?

52:41.550 --> 52:42.550
What is it?

52:42.680 --> 52:44.470
This glove.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.560
I broke it into pieces, and swallowed them

52:50.020 --> 52:51.980
Then restored it to its original state.

52:53.440 --> 52:57.650
Cos I predicted that he'd enter my body.

52:59.110 --> 53:00.230
Josuke...

53:25.380 --> 53:28.260
It's alright now. Wake up.

53:29.060 --> 53:30.350
Grandpa!

53:41.030 --> 53:42.190
Grandpa...

53:43.650 --> 53:45.200
Grandpa?

53:48.410 --> 53:49.820
It can't be!

53:51.080 --> 53:54.700
I can heal such wounds easily!

53:56.330 --> 53:58.380
Since young, I've healed them so many times.

54:00.210 --> 54:01.250
Hey!

54:01.920 --> 54:04.710
Are you tired? Grandpa?

54:05.420 --> 54:06.340
Grandpa!

54:07.300 --> 54:08.470
Grandpa!

54:08.800 --> 54:09.470
Grandpa...

54:09.470 --> 54:10.300
Josuke!

54:11.930 --> 54:14.810
Don't worry. The wound has been completely...

54:16.940 --> 54:18.310
Humans...

54:19.650 --> 54:22.650
destroy things in order to survive.

54:24.530 --> 54:25.940
Among them,

54:27.570 --> 54:30.700
your power is kinder than any others in this world.

54:32.620 --> 54:33.660
But...

54:35.580 --> 54:38.620
A life that has ended can't be brought back.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.670
No matter what Stand it is...

54:43.710 --> 54:45.210
it can't bring back a life.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.270
Grandpa...

55:04.570 --> 55:07.570
Gran..Grandpa...

55:17.960 --> 55:19.960
I won't let you catch me.

55:30.220 --> 55:32.220
You are the one at fault.

55:32.350 --> 55:34.350
Because you got in my way.

55:35.890 --> 55:37.890
Don't mess with me.

55:51.490 --> 55:54.320
How did you become a Stand user?

55:54.740 --> 55:56.120
Who knows.

55:58.160 --> 56:01.540
What will you do? There's someone more dangerous than me in this town.

56:01.670 --> 56:03.830
You guys can't defeat him.

56:05.170 --> 56:07.250
Hey, wait, wait.

56:10.630 --> 56:14.180
I was struck by an arrow.

56:15.050 --> 56:16.180
Then...

56:16.890 --> 56:18.180
Who did it?

56:18.770 --> 56:22.600
I don't know his name. A young man.

56:24.690 --> 56:26.900
He chose me on his own accord.

56:27.860 --> 56:29.530
He's the one at fault.

56:29.650 --> 56:31.440
You bastard...

56:38.700 --> 56:42.870
Don't keep blaming everything on others!

56:49.710 --> 56:51.970
Are you trying to kill me?

57:04.770 --> 57:09.440
Certainly, I've killed so many people to date.

57:11.570 --> 57:14.740
But you've got no right to kill me!

57:18.870 --> 57:20.990
If you kill me,

57:21.750 --> 57:23.660
it'll make you the same as me,

57:24.830 --> 57:26.960
a cursed soul.

57:37.140 --> 57:39.760
I will not kill anyone.

57:47.150 --> 57:48.770
Nobody...

57:50.610 --> 57:53.110
will sentence you to death.

57:55.110 --> 57:56.240
Not me.

57:57.780 --> 57:59.990
Not this Jotaro-san.

58:03.330 --> 58:05.660
Not the law in Japan.

58:08.460 --> 58:10.880
Nobody will sentence you to death.

58:14.470 --> 58:17.220
You won't be going to prison either.

58:21.970 --> 58:23.350
Josuke.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.770
I'll leave the rest to you.

58:31.820 --> 58:33.570
What are you going to do?

58:38.820 --> 58:40.870
Crazy...

58:42.990 --> 58:44.790
Diamond.

58:57.970 --> 58:59.180
Stop it!

59:02.970 --> 59:05.470
Hand... My hand!!!

59:21.530 --> 59:22.370
Stop!

59:22.780 --> 59:24.370
Please, stop!

59:37.010 --> 59:39.380
Pray for the souls, for eternity.

59:40.430 --> 59:41.800
Angelo.

59:43.390 --> 59:46.220
For the souls of the people you've killed.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.030
Bro.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.950
What's wrong?

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.700
Katagiri Anjuro has been defeated.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.540
Really?

01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:59.300
By?

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:02.840
Higashikata Josuke.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:08.010
A Stand user I do not know.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.600
Do not know?

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.770
Meaning, he didn't become one from your arrow?

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.650
Is that guy...

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.610
strong?

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.410
We are stronger than him.

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:39.090
That's true.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.510
That's for sure, isn't it?

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.630
Bro.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.730
The Sugimoto Family
Father: Takashi (45)
Mother: Kazuko (39)
Daughter: Reimi (16)

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:48.530
(Family of Three Found Dead in Morioh-cho)
(Zero Clues to Brutal Family Murder)

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:54.910
Josuke, it's almost time.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.540
It's that incident from 16 years ago.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:05.840
The one that Dad regretted the most.

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:10.340
He wanted to catch this murderer with his own hands.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.310
The female high school student who was killed was really cheerful,

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.190
and always greeted him.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.400
She was Dad's source of encouragement.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.050
This was the watch awarded to him during his 20th year of service.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.920
But when that incident happened,

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:53.260
Dad hit it hard against the wall.

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.310
"I fail as a policeman."

01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:00.730
"I couldn't protect that girl."

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.980
Since then,

01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.110
Dad didn't try for promotion,

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.820
and only desperately wanted to protect this town.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.160
Josuke.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.790
Dad was a policeman to the very end.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.960
He is our pride.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.520
Josuke-kun!

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.150
Koichi, you go back.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.530
I will, if you go back too.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.370
You suddenly disappeared. Everyone was worried.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.300
(Entry Forbidden)

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:42.300
This place is creepy.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:50.440
What is it?

01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:53.360
What is inside this house?

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.780
You shouldn't be entering
other people's house without permission, damn it!

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.250
You are a thief, aren't you!

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:09.920
Who cares if a thief dies?

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.130
Take that foot off him.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.420
Koichi!

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:25.100
I, Nijimura Okuyasu,

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.390
will erase you with The Hand!

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.440
Move away!

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.150
I can still heal his wound now.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.940
We aren't playing around, Okuyasu.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.870
Make sure you finish off this Higashikata Josuke who defeated Angelo!

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:46.490
Okay, I got it...

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.660
Bro.

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.680
You are pretty fast.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.270
What's with the way this hand moves?

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:28.990
Let go of my right hand!

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.330
Indeed there's something dangerous about this right hand.

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.890
You aren't getting away!

01:08:55.479 --> 01:09:02.950
(Entry -bidden)

01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:07.779
The "For" is gone.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.660
I see.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.000
You erased it, huh.

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:17.330
The space.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.260
This right hand erases everything in its way.

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.180
And the parts that remain...

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:30.140
joins back together...

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.140
like nothing happened.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:39.649
Even I have no idea where the erased parts go.

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:42.689
To people who try to escape,

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:46.569
I can even do this.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:51.950
When I erase the space like that...

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.540
It's teleportation.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:05.510
As long as I have this, you can never escape from me.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:25.690
Are you still going to continue bragging?

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:32.120
This is the last.

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:38.080
Next I'm going to erase you!

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.340
Thank god you are stupid.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.060
Koichi?

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.470
You bastard.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.430
Enough of your nonsense!

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.940
This arrow...

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.570
is precious, the one and only one.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.740
I have to retrieve it.

01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:54.830
Hey!

01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.080
Don't take it out.

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:02.000
He'll bleed profusely.

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:03.710
I'll take it out.

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:08.710
When you finish listening to a CD,

01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:13.840
you'll place it back properly into the case,
before taking out another CD, right?

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.350
Anyone would do that.

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.900
I will do that too.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.570
You bastard!

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.160
This guy wasn't chosen.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.910
It was a meaningless encounter.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.420
Don't mess with me.

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.730
Bro!

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.610
Don't start your attack on this guy first.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.230
I'm not done with him yet.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.780
Attack?

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:22.500
Hey!

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:34.340
Your stupidity never cease to amaze me, little brother.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.760
You walked right into the line of fire.

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:41.390
Bro...

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.110
I'm sorry...

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:51.110
Incompetent people only drag others down.

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:55.990
I've been telling you this repeatedly since we were kids, right?

01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:02.410
Stop it!

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.160
He's your brother, damn it!

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:10.540
I've given up on him already.

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.760
He's of no use to me at all.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.550
Damn it!

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920
Hey.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.670
What's that from your brother?

01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.840
What power does he have?

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:02.100
Tell me!

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.970
If you do, I'll heal those wounds.

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:12.360
Like hell I would...

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.320
He's...my brother...

01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:20.990
As expected...

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.530
You won't say, huh.

01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:30.830
Of course I won't...

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.050
Well then... I guess I've no choice.

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:15.460
It does' t hurt.

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:18.170
Yeah. See you.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.760
You healed my wounds...

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.940
Hey, wait!

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:39.530
Why did you heal my wounds?

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:45.280
Shut up. I'll tell you later.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.700
I'm your enemy, you know.

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.290
You healed me...

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:57.880
But I'll attack you again, you know.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.260
There's no deep reason.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.100
There's no reason for you to die.

01:17:08.010 --> 01:17:10.140
That's what I thought, that's all.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.480
Wait, Josuke!

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:20.110
What is it?! Are you going to get in my way again?

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.610
Why?

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:27.660
Why are you not...

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:32.660
fixing your own wounds with your Stand?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.380
I can't repair my own wounds with my Stand.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.470
And more than anything,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.260
I can't do anything about people who are dead.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.890
So I'm telling you, Okuyasu.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.820
If Koichi dies,

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.610
I don't know what I'm going to do to your brother.

01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:44.900
Koichi...

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.520
Okuyasu! You!

01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:37.950
Koichi!

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:52.140
Because I'm stupid,

01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:57.640
I only do what comes to my head.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:05.270
Just this once.

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:11.320
Now we're even.

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:15.200
After this...

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:18.950
I won't do anything.

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:34.800
That's just great~ Okuyasu.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.940
Josuke-kun?

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:51.240
What happened?

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.570
Koichi!

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.010
Koichi, we're leaving.

01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:37.200
Koichi!

01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:27.120
Koichi!

01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:58.200
This is just great

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:27.810
Josuke-kun!

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.020
Koichi! Hide!

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.430
The tank is conning too!

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.510
Is this for real?

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.220
Even a tank...

01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:12.850
Koichi!

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.900
What did you just say?

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.320
Can you see this Stand?

01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:58.270
You bastard!

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.210
How is this?

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:18.590
Isn't it beautiful? The formation of Bad Company,
the Stand of I, Nijimura Keicho.

01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:23.840
An impregnable defense.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.680
Any attacker or intruder will not return home alive.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.020
Seems like you were chosen after all.

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:38.900
Koichi.

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:42.110
You've become a Stand user.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:46.110
Stand user?

01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:51.370
Sorry, I still don't know much about it.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:53.620
Come on.

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.290
Show me your power.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.130
Power?

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.600
Ouch.

01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:34.750
Is that your Stand?

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:36.540
Come on.

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.330
Attack me with it.

01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.380
E...even if you say that, I can't.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.680
It's easy to use your Stand.

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:53.220
Just think of how you're going to attack that person you despise.

01:26:58.770 --> 01:27:00.100
Entire force.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.070
Prepare to commence full attack.

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:20.750
Koichi!

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920
If the Stand is destroyed, you die too.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.710
Hurry take it back.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.760
How??

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.420
Commence attack.

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:03.080
Josuke-kun!

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:19.180
Direct all firepower...

01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:23.770
at Higashikata Josuke, and exterminate him.

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:36.780
Stop it!

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:38.910
It's a pity,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.130
but once I give a command, it can't be modified.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.770
Finish him off.

01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:14.260
Stop it.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.270
Stop it.

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.480
Stop it...

01:30:31.190 --> 01:30:34.110
Stop it!!!

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.090
What?

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.400
This is your Stand?

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:20.360
As expected, I don't have a need for it.

01:31:30.710 --> 01:31:32.250
Koichi...

01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:37.170
You've done enough.

01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:46.640
What is it?

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.690
Have you given up already?

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.190
Are you asking me to spare you?

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.040
I can't do that.

01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.220
Not that.

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.100
Nijimura Keicho.

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:32.060
My plan is all set.

01:32:35.230 --> 01:32:36.570
What?

01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:49.750
My Crazy Diamond...

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.460
can restore anything that's broken.

01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:00.760
Hey, Bad Company, shoot them down.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.090
Protect me!

01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:10.430
Take down the missiles!

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.940
Once you give a command, it can't be modified, right?

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:24.450
These guys...

01:33:25.410 --> 01:33:27.910
can't take down the missiles.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.740
Josuke-kun.

01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:08.870
Just now...

01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:11.580
Yeah.

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.620
My Stand, Crazy Diamond,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.340
only tried to return his missiles to where they came from.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:23.550
Amazing.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.430
Thanks to you.

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.720
You bought me time.

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.290
Josuke-kun.

01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.300
I hear something.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.230
Koichi, you wait here.

01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:20.230
I'll go destroy that bow and arrow.

01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:23.730
I'll go too.

01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:33.740
Josuke-kun, you are wounded.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.440
Koichi!

01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:16.430
A Stand?

01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:20.060
No, this guy isn't a Stand.

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:23.640
It's for real. This is seriously a monster.

01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:26.690
He's not a monster.

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.370
That guy is our father.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.290
And this bow and arrow...

01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:53.090
are things I need...

01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:58.510
for my father.

01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:04.230
I can't hand it over to you!

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.070
Does your father have some kind of illness?

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:16.490
My father is in the pink of health.

01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:22.620
But he doesn't know what's going on.

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.250
He's just living on meaninglessly.

01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:32.420
He was stingy with money,

01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:36.300
and hated by everyone.

01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:42.220
He's a scum of a guy who even abused his own sons.

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.100
He's got his punishment.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.110
Now he doesn't even remember he's human.

01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:07.580
Are you searching for a Stand to heal your father?

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.340
Heal?

01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:25.810
It's the opposite.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.150
My father will never die.

01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:36.150
Even if his head gets crushed,

01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:40.450
or his body gets chopped into pieces,

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.950
or if we tried to erase him, it doesn't work.

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.040
At this rate,

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.130
he can only live on forever.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.300
It can't be...

01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:20.490
He's like this all day.

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.370
Day after day,

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:27.200
he'd be uselessly scratching around that box of junk.

01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:35.040
Haven't I told you time and again not to make a mess!?!

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.880
Stop it.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.840
He's your father

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.390
He's my father, yet he isn't.

01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:52.480
He doesn't remember us,

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.650
or our dead mother at all.

01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:03.700
Do you understand how unbearable this is?!

01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:11.830
That's exactly why,

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.800
I want him to die a normal death.

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.010
When he s dead,

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:34.940
my life will finally begin.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.510
Damn it! I said stop it, didn't I?!

01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:11.680
Hey!

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:12.720
That's as far as you go!

01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:13.730
Don't come near.

01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:17.480
I'm not handing you the bow and arrow!

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.230
Don't get it wrong. We'll talk about that later.

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.400
What I'm interested in is this box.

01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:47.110
See!

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.160
It's your family photo.

01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:54.740
Your father has been searching for this every single day.

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:02.960
He remembers. Deep down inside.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.760
His memories of all of you...

01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:10.260
still remain.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.690
I don't mind helping you.

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.610
Nijimura Keicho.

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:28.820
That's if, rather than a Stand that can kill him,

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:32.280
you want to find a Stand that can heal him.

01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:57.140
Come on. Hand me those.

01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:59.890
I'll destroy them!

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.700
I won't hand them over.

01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:18.990
Bro!

01:45:21.210 --> 01:45:24.540
Let's stop it already.

01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:27.840
Dad too, he might be cured some day

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.550
Okuyasu!

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:35.720
No matter what I do, there's no way I can turn back.

01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:38.600
With this bow and arrow

01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.930
I've already killed so many people in this town.

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.950
Gravity brings us together.

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.910
Gravity pulls everything together.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.960
I do not intend to defy that destiny.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.420
You're wrong!

01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:21.060
Destiny can be changed, however you want it to.

01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:26.230
That's right, Bro. Let's start over

01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:28.110
You are...

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.740
no longer my little brother.

01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:44.790
Bro...

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:26.580
Okuyasu!

01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:34.500
Don't space out!

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.180
Move away!

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.640
Okuyasu...

01:47:51.730 --> 01:47:53.690
You are...

01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:57.190
always...

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:01.700
dragging me down...

01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:22.220
Bro!

01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.650
Bro!

01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:10.640
Bro...

01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:13.520
Bro!

01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:19.110
You bastard! Where are you?!

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:21.490
Okuyasu!

01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:46.340
My brother...

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.470
got what was coming to him.

01:49:57.110 --> 01:49:59.360
But in the end, Bro...

01:50:02.490 --> 01:50:06.030
At the very end, my brother...

01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:11.490
shielded me, right?

01:50:15.170 --> 01:50:16.540
Josuke.

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.550
You saw that too, right?

01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:28.680
Yeah.

01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:32.890
I saw it clearly.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.770
Is that so?

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:21.060
That Stand...

01:51:21.570 --> 01:51:23.780
took Nijimura Keicho's life,

01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:26.900
and destroyed the bow and arrow, huh.

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.410
Yes.

01:51:35.410 --> 01:51:38.620
Stand user are drawn to each other.

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.960
That guy will one day.

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.800
appear in front of me, for sure.

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:48.430
Yeah.

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.390
Josuke.

01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:55.430
Will you be alright?

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.100
Jotaro-san.

01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:06.440
The "Jo" in "Josuke"...

01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:08.990
means "to protect

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.990
To protect, and help people.

01:52:17.250 --> 01:52:21.960
Grandpa gave me this name.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:30.630
These 35 years, he didn't try for promotion,

01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:35.760
and have always been protecting the people of this town.

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.520
That's why I've also decided.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:49.440
I'm going to continue Grandpa's efforts.

01:52:56.490 --> 01:52:59.040
I will protect this town.

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:03.170
No matter what happens.

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:18.180
I'm Hirose Koichi.

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:22.020
I moved in to this Morioh-cho two weeks ago.

01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:32.570
Josuke-kun! Okuyasu-kun!

01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.860
Good morning!

01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:35.070
Good morning!

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.910
Yo! Angelo!

01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:41.410
Angelo.

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.370
Yo, Angelo.

01:53:48.170 --> 01:53:55.340
(Please clean up after your dog)

01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:59.560
Then I met these two,

01:53:59.890 --> 01:54:03.520
and became a Stand user like them.

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.770
A new day begins.

01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:22.040
(Track & Field, Hurdles - 3rd Place)

01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:27.610
(English Speech Contest - 3rd Place)

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.130
Its the fifth day since a female university student
of Futatsumori, Morioh-cho, went missing.

01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:33.720
The police are investigating a possible connection to the...

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.800
recent spate of strange deaths and disappearances.
