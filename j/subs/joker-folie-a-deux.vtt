Morning, sir.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.345
Nothing good about it.

03:35.954 --> 03:36.738
Get up!

03:42.918 --> 03:44.485
Let's go, get up.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.879
Let's go boys.
Let's get this show on the road.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.185
Come on! Come on!

03:49.359 --> 03:50.665
Come on, get out of bed.

03:50.839 --> 03:51.666
Let's go, get up.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.495
Clean this fucking mess up.

03:55.931 --> 03:56.975
Hey, Jackie, I need a hand.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.240
Put some clothes on.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.850
Diaz, what the fuck?

04:11.642 --> 04:13.122
You got a joke for me today?

04:13.905 --> 04:14.776
Move!

04:17.866 --> 04:19.476
All right, come on,
let's go, guys.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.913
Move your fucking ass. Move.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.657
Don't test me, Walters.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.268
Come on, boys.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.444
Get him on the ground.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.489
Move your fucking ass, Bullock.

04:32.663 --> 04:33.577
Fuck you!

04:35.187 --> 04:36.319
Get the fuck out my cell.

04:38.539 --> 04:39.888
Leave me alone.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.890
Hey, Arthur, you feelin'
crazy today or what?

04:43.631 --> 04:44.719
I don't wanna come out today.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.242
Take him down to F Ward.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.983
I don't wanna come out today.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.377
You got a big day today.
You better put on a happy face.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.856
Get the fuck off me.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.877
Let's not do this again, Beanie.

05:17.926 --> 05:18.927
Shut up!

05:26.326 --> 05:27.544
Let's go, Arthur.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.372
Come on, Fleck.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.722
Don't need your fancy lawyer
blaming me if you're late.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.246
She knows how much you like me, right?

05:36.161 --> 05:37.815
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

05:39.817 --> 05:41.471
Yeah,
it's been a while, hasn't it?

06:10.979 --> 06:11.936
Move.

06:26.081 --> 06:26.995
Right on the line.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.432
Let's go!

06:29.606 --> 06:31.260
Back the fuck up, Ken.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go on, front of the line.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.918
Fleck. Fleck's next, my dear.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.790
Hey, stay in line.

06:39.964 --> 06:40.835
Yeah, you heard him.

06:43.577 --> 06:44.969
Hey, hey, hey, back up.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.756
Freak bit me!

06:53.369 --> 06:54.152
Go.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.598
All that kid's done
since he got here
is fucking smile.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.209
And today, all of a sudden,
he bites Moran?

07:07.383 --> 07:09.124
It's because nobody likes Moran.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.082
He was at Gotham State
for, like, eight years

07:11.256 --> 07:13.476
before he got here,
and he's still a fucking temp.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.660
Hey, Fleck,
you got a joke for us today?

07:23.834 --> 07:25.532
I already asked him.

07:25.706 --> 07:26.924
I got a joke for ya.

07:29.318 --> 07:33.061
This guy's dog dies, right?
And he really loved this dog.

07:33.888 --> 07:38.240
So, he goes down to the church,
and he asks Father Mulcahy

07:38.414 --> 07:40.982
if he'd perform
a funeral for him. Right?

07:41.373 --> 07:44.551
And Mulcahy says, "Oh, no.
I'm sorry my son,

07:44.725 --> 07:47.815
we can't have a service
for an animal in our church.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.686
Uh, but, I bet if you go down

07:49.860 --> 07:51.906
- to the veterinarian in town..."
-  Fuck.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.342
"...he can do it
for you. You see?"

07:53.516 --> 07:55.257
Goddamn it, Arthur.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.564
Uh, so the guy says,
"Oh, thanks very much, Father."

07:57.738 --> 08:00.392
And he says,
"Do you think two grand

08:00.567 --> 08:02.394
would be enough
to cover the service?"

08:03.874 --> 08:05.702
Father Mulcahy looks at him...

08:06.834 --> 08:09.663
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was Catholic?"

08:14.145 --> 08:15.495
Eh?

08:15.669 --> 08:16.539
Clean yourself up.

08:16.713 --> 08:17.845
You like that one, Arthur?

08:18.976 --> 08:21.936
Let's go.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.851
"Why didn't you tell me
the dog was a Catholic?"

09:21.299 --> 09:22.692
Look around, Arthur.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.781
This is how
the other half lives.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.348
Could have been all yours

09:26.522 --> 09:27.218
if you hadn't killed
five people.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.221
One live on national TV.

09:32.397 --> 09:35.313
<i>♪ When you close your

Hey!

10:05.822 --> 10:08.042
Come on. You fucking lunatic.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.267
Jesus Christ, you couldn't
get him a fucking umbrella?

10:16.441 --> 10:18.400
Aw, come on, counselor,

10:18.574 --> 10:20.228
you know we can't
give these boys umbrellas.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.882
It's for their own good.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.753
Oh, don't give me your shit.
He's soaking wet.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.668
Well, those are the rules,
counselor,

10:25.842 --> 10:28.018
but I'll break them
if you ask me.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.280
I bet you would.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.847
Mm-hm.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.544
Oh, you're welcome, by the way,

10:32.719 --> 10:33.894
for getting him
all cleaned up for you.

10:36.244 --> 10:37.158
Sit down.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.204
Here, Arthur.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.733
Today,
we're meeting with Dr. Beatty.

10:46.907 --> 10:47.908
Remember her?

10:49.474 --> 10:51.172
She's gonna be
videotaping you this time,

10:51.346 --> 10:54.305
so we can show it at your
competency hearing next week.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.830
And if they find you competent,

10:57.004 --> 10:58.875
and they will, they always do,

10:59.049 --> 11:00.877
then we're going to trial.

11:02.226 --> 11:07.144
You need to be in an actual
hospital with actual doctors.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.495
Not this
Department of Corrections...

11:10.670 --> 11:12.672
bullshit with these thugs.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.633
Dr. Beatty thinks
that with everything

11:17.807 --> 11:19.940
that happened to you
in your childhood,

11:20.114 --> 11:22.159
it caused a split...

11:23.857 --> 11:27.164
this fragmentation in you...

11:27.338 --> 11:29.166
...to help you cope
with your pain.

11:30.037 --> 11:34.563
She believes you have another
person living inside of you.

11:34.737 --> 11:39.568
And it was this other person
who committed those crimes.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.964
Do you understand
what that means, Arthur?

11:48.185 --> 11:50.361
<i>I'll be asking you
a few questions today, Arthur,
okay?</i>

11:53.190 --> 11:57.194
<i>Maybe you don't remember
some things?</i>

11:57.368 --> 12:00.067
<i>Or you're confused
about what you did?</i>

12:00.807 --> 12:02.983
<i>I'm here to help you
try and sort out what happened.</i>

12:11.426 --> 12:15.343
Arthur, I'm not here
only to help with your defense.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.085
I'm here for you.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.479
<i>But for me to do my job,</i>

12:21.653 --> 12:25.266
<i>I need you to be
candid with me.</i>

12:25.440 --> 12:26.658
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

12:29.226 --> 12:30.793
<i>Can I have a cigarette?</i>

12:31.620 --> 12:32.490
<i>Of course you can.</i>

12:36.973 --> 12:40.542
<i>Let's start
with the first incident, okay?</i>

12:41.717 --> 12:46.983
<i>The three men who accosted you
on the subway, who bullied you,</i>

12:47.157 --> 12:49.420
<i>did it feel like they
triggered something painful?</i>

12:49.594 --> 12:51.161
<i>From your past? Your childhood?</i>

12:52.859 --> 12:54.556
Do you remember
any of what happened?

12:58.690 --> 13:01.432
Did you... black out?

13:01.606 --> 13:03.086
See bright lights?

13:04.522 --> 13:05.872
Mm...

13:10.354 --> 13:11.138
Okay.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.708
How about Murray Franklin?

13:19.146 --> 13:20.930
What, if anything, do you
remember about that night?

13:28.546 --> 13:29.678
<i>The music.</i>

13:32.681 --> 13:34.944
<i>That's good.
Arthur, that is good.</i>

13:37.860 --> 13:39.688
Can I tell you what I remember
about that night?

13:41.429 --> 13:45.346
I remember you came out
dressed as Joker.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.917
And I remember Joker
was dancing to that music.

13:51.874 --> 13:52.788
<i>Right?</i>

13:55.486 --> 13:57.184
<i>I really liked his band.</i>

13:59.229 --> 14:03.538
<i>My mom and I u-- used
to watch the show together.</i>

14:04.408 --> 14:06.062
<i>She liked
Murray Franklin as well?</i>

14:08.717 --> 14:10.675
<i>"He's so handsome.</i>

14:10.850 --> 14:12.634
<i>Look at those
sparkling white teeth."</i>

14:16.072 --> 14:17.421
Is that your mother's voice?

14:18.118 --> 14:19.510
Mm.

14:19.684 --> 14:20.816
Do you often hear her voice
in your head?

14:23.253 --> 14:24.385
All the time.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.825
Did it change
at all after she died?

14:30.957 --> 14:32.262
What does that mean?

14:32.915 --> 14:33.916
Did you...

14:35.962 --> 14:37.659
this other part of you...

14:39.008 --> 14:40.575
Joker...

14:41.271 --> 14:43.752
Did it come out more
after she died?

14:43.926 --> 14:46.494
You lived together, right?
In a one-bedroom apartment?

14:52.456 --> 14:54.589
Maybe I could talk to Joker
about it.

14:56.591 --> 14:57.940
Would he like to talk to me?

15:26.969 --> 15:27.927
Hey, Arthur.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.972
Arthur.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.148
I mean,
he'll do anything. Anything.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.150
The guards said you wanted
to show me how to kiss.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.547
But they said Joker's
a really good kisser.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.245
Nobody's ever gave me
a kiss before.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.685
Twenty bucks
says he chokes him.

15:56.259 --> 15:57.434
There you go.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.263
Ricky don't know what hit him.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.961
There was no hesitation.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.440
Yeah, yeah.

16:03.614 --> 16:04.441
Kinda like...

16:07.053 --> 16:08.793
I gotta be honest with you,
Arthur.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.188
I wouldn't have took you
for a hopeless romantic.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.581
Can I have a cigarette?

16:15.061 --> 16:16.366
Why not.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.020
Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

16:18.194 --> 16:20.022
He doesn't get a cigarette
unless he tells a joke.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.068
No, come on. He still
makes us laugh, doesn't he?

16:22.242 --> 16:24.070
Barely.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.114
Hey.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.248
Remember that music class
we saw?

16:28.726 --> 16:30.946
The other day? B Ward?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.079
Remember, with all the singing?

16:33.253 --> 16:36.038
I got you in.
We're going next week.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.258
Bullshit.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.912
- The fuck you do that for?
- Eh, eh. No, no.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.958
Went and saw Kellerman,
I said...

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
you've been good.
You deserve it.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.702
The hell is he thinking?

16:47.876 --> 16:49.573
Yeah.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.011
He knows he can get
some good press for it.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.230
Plus, I told him
I'd go along with him.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.623
Oh, ho, there it is.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.712
That explains it.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.801
Count! Let's go.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.194
Line up by two.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.500
Ricky. Come on, Romeo,
line 'em up.

17:03.674 --> 17:06.199
Let's go. Twos.
Line up by twos.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.156
Come on, let's go.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.245
Are you being serious?

17:09.419 --> 17:10.507
I am being serious.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.379
On the Bible.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.990
Wasn't that hard, either.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.125
Ever since they made
that TV movie about you,

17:19.299 --> 17:21.344
everybody still thinks
you're a star.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.956
How about you, Arthur?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.524
Do you still think
you're a star?

17:29.874 --> 17:31.702
I bet you do, don't you?

Arthur Fleck.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.397
Now, I know it's odd to have
an inmate from E Ward in here,

20:24.571 --> 20:27.530
but I have been assured
he's been a model patient

20:27.704 --> 20:29.271
without any incidents.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.711
I know this might feel strange,
Mr. Fleck, a new environment.

20:34.885 --> 20:38.541
You see, we use music
in this class to make us whole,

20:38.715 --> 20:41.065
to balance
the conflicting forces, the...

20:42.502 --> 20:45.418
...the fractures
within ourselves.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.638
All I ask is that you sing,

20:48.812 --> 20:51.250

21:47.480 --> 21:49.177
I killed five people.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.353
One live on national television.

21:52.615 --> 21:53.529
What about you?

21:55.575 --> 21:57.925
I set fire to my parents'
apartment building.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.060
Actually...

22:04.801 --> 22:05.846
...it was six.

22:07.369 --> 22:09.153
Nobody knows,
but also I killed my mother.

22:12.505 --> 22:13.941
I should have done that.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.639
My mother had me committed.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.554
She says I'm psychotic.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.342
You know, I must've watched
that TV movie

22:23.516 --> 22:25.213
they made about you,
like, 20 times.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.911
Yeah. Was it good?

22:29.217 --> 22:30.871
They won't let me watch it.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.089
It was good.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.918
It was really good.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.530
I grew up
in the same neighborhood.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.358
Me and my friends
used to take that staircase

22:39.532 --> 22:41.360
to school every day.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.319
My parents didn't
give a fuck about me either.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.321
My father beat the shit
out of me.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.370
Well, guess what?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.154
"Knock, knock."

22:53.328 --> 22:55.548
"Sorry, kid, your dad
was killed in a car accident."

23:00.204 --> 23:02.990
Sorry. That's not funny.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.606
If only those friends
could see me now.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.482

when I saw you
on <i>Murray Franklin,</i>

23:19.398 --> 23:22.444
the whole time I was watching,
I kept thinking,

23:22.618 --> 23:26.274
"I hope this guy
blows his brains out."

23:30.887 --> 23:32.541

let him ask me questions later.

24:46.397 --> 24:47.703

24:49.357 --> 24:51.272

Yeah.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.066
One of the guards let me in.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.548
I'd do anything for you.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.074
But we don't have a lot of time.
Come here.

38:14.248 --> 38:15.380
What?

38:16.076 --> 38:17.817
Come on. Can you get up?

38:20.298 --> 38:21.734
Come into the light.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.527
They're sending me home.

38:33.485 --> 38:36.096
What? Why?

38:37.053 --> 38:38.968
They're saying you're
a bad influence on me.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.363
What?

38:45.018 --> 38:47.063
This is gonna be good for us.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.717
Now, I can be at your trial
every day.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.719
I can see you every day
until you get out.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.636
And then what?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.945
We're gonna build a mountain.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.690
Wait, wait.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.182
You brought make-up.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.316
I want to see the real you.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.343
Look what they did to you.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.473
It's just us now.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.964
You need to stop
taking your medication.

40:45.138 --> 40:46.792
I already have.

41:07.116 --> 41:08.378
Can you do it?

41:08.553 --> 41:09.771
Yeah.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.464
What's he gonna ask me about?

41:50.638 --> 41:52.988
Besides... you know.

41:54.381 --> 41:57.166
Well, hopefully,
about your life in here,

41:57.819 --> 42:00.387
and what the conditions
are really like in this place.

42:01.736 --> 42:04.391
He might ask you about Lee.

42:04.565 --> 42:07.525
She's been out there giving
a lot of interviews about you.

42:07.699 --> 42:08.743
And about herself.

42:09.614 --> 42:10.702
Good.

42:11.877 --> 42:13.313
You know, I love her.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.403
She gets me.

42:17.012 --> 42:19.232
Two minutes. Paddy's ready.

42:20.146 --> 42:21.451
Arthur.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.325
This is a chance for you to show
a different side of yourself.

42:26.456 --> 42:29.938
So the public can see
who you really are.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.331
And I don't think
you should smoke.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.638
I think it makes you
look cavalier.

42:33.812 --> 42:34.639
Okay.

42:34.813 --> 42:36.815
We need to use this time

42:36.989 --> 42:39.731
to show people
that you're human.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.996
They need to understand
you were sick. Delusional.

42:44.170 --> 42:45.519
Mm-hm.

42:45.693 --> 42:49.392
You're not Joker.
You're Arthur Fleck.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.785
Hm?

42:52.134 --> 42:54.136
Don't worry.
You're gonna be great.

42:57.531 --> 42:58.619
Arthur.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.800
Are you okay? It's--

43:07.410 --> 43:09.151
It's not too late to cancel.

43:14.113 --> 43:19.161
So, uh... you want me
to call you Arthur or The Joker?

43:19.335 --> 43:21.163
Mr. Meyers,
you know we have an agreement.

43:21.337 --> 43:22.991
You can't call him "Joker."

43:23.165 --> 43:25.385
It's Arthur. Arthur Fleck.

43:27.561 --> 43:28.954
When you're ready, Paddy.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.521
She has to leave now.

43:32.348 --> 43:33.262
You can watch
from behind the glass,

43:33.436 --> 43:34.350
but you can't be in here.

43:35.656 --> 43:36.831
Just be yourself.

43:46.667 --> 43:48.408
- We rolling?
- Rolling.

43:51.541 --> 43:52.499
<i>Cameras up.</i>

43:54.196 --> 43:56.329
<i>Two years ago,
the name Arthur Fleck</i>

43:56.503 --> 43:58.723
<i>hit Gotham like a hurricane.</i>

43:58.897 --> 44:00.899
An unassuming part-time
party clown

44:01.073 --> 44:03.075
and struggling stand-up comic,

44:03.249 --> 44:05.947
Fleck committed
five horrific murders

44:06.121 --> 44:08.167
in the span of just four weeks.

44:08.515 --> 44:11.997
And now, with hundreds
already lining up to get a seat

44:12.171 --> 44:15.348
at one of the first trials
ever broadcast live on TV,

44:15.522 --> 44:18.220
<i>Arthur Fleck, The Joker,</i>

44:18.394 --> 44:20.483
<i>is sitting down
for his first interview</i>

44:20.658 --> 44:23.486
<i>since that infamous night
on</i> Murray Franklin.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.925
<i>And yes, we all know
how that turned out.</i>

44:30.493 --> 44:32.757
Arthur Fleck, welcome.

44:33.409 --> 44:34.672
Hello.

44:35.324 --> 44:39.372
Take me back to that night
onstage with Murray Franklin.

44:40.286 --> 44:43.158
What was going
through your mind...

44:43.332 --> 44:45.683
when you pulled out that gun
and blew his brains out?

44:49.687 --> 44:52.428
Well, Paddy, um...

44:55.997 --> 44:59.000
I was going through a lot
back then. Um...

44:59.174 --> 45:03.091
I don't really remember much
from that night. I, uh...

45:03.265 --> 45:06.007
blacked out,
I saw bright lights.

45:06.181 --> 45:08.575
<i>I was having a hard time</i>

45:08.749 --> 45:11.056
<i>knowing the difference
between what was real or not.</i>

45:11.230 --> 45:12.274
<i>Oh, please.</i>

45:12.448 --> 45:14.624
You did it on live TV, pal.

45:14.799 --> 45:16.061
Doesn't get any more real
than that.

45:17.671 --> 45:19.281
Paddy, all I remember
from that night

45:19.455 --> 45:21.457
is I was gonna kill myself.

45:21.631 --> 45:23.155
On television.

45:24.156 --> 45:26.854
I thought Murray
was playing a part in my show.

45:28.029 --> 45:29.596
But he was a bad actor.

45:29.770 --> 45:31.990
So he got what he deserved.

45:32.468 --> 45:34.862
Your last joke,
if we can call it a joke,

45:35.036 --> 45:36.646
"You get
what you bleeping deserve."

45:36.821 --> 45:37.952
That's what you said.

45:38.126 --> 45:40.563
That's not fun,
that's not funny.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.697
You're right, I...
I should have told a better one.

45:45.525 --> 45:46.918
You're trying to be funny now?

45:47.657 --> 45:48.441
No.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.881
Do you deserve to die?

45:54.316 --> 45:56.057
The DA is calling
for the death penalty.

45:56.231 --> 45:58.407
You just said that you wanted
to kill yourself on TV.

45:58.581 --> 45:59.539
So, tell us...

46:00.801 --> 46:02.760
...you still wanna die?

46:04.152 --> 46:07.460
Well, at the time, it certainly
seemed a lot easier than living.

46:08.113 --> 46:11.290
Um, but that's...
that's not me anymore.

46:11.464 --> 46:12.465
That's not...

46:13.814 --> 46:14.728
That's not who I am.

46:14.902 --> 46:16.121
That wasn't really you.

46:16.295 --> 46:17.165
No, that's not right.

46:17.339 --> 46:18.819
Let me get this straight.

46:18.993 --> 46:20.690
- That's not what I meant.
- So your defense is,

46:20.865 --> 46:22.649
"It was The Joker who did it."

46:22.823 --> 46:24.433
- An insanity defense.
- Okay, I don't--

46:24.607 --> 46:25.826
I don't know about a defense.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.263
That this alternate personality,

46:28.437 --> 46:31.614
this killer clown in you
killed Murray.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.487
Who am I speaking to now?
Which one of you is here?

46:34.661 --> 46:37.577
The poor, low IQ Arthur Fleck?

46:37.751 --> 46:39.884
Or The Joker, who goaded
a bunch of no-good punks--

46:40.058 --> 46:41.711
Do you really care?

46:42.538 --> 46:43.713
You don't.

46:44.758 --> 46:46.412
You're just like Murray.

46:46.586 --> 46:48.936
You're just like everyone.
You want sensationalism.

46:49.110 --> 46:50.416
You don't care about...

46:50.590 --> 46:52.461
You just wanna talk
about my mistakes.

46:52.635 --> 46:53.941
You wanna talk about the things
that I did in the past.

46:54.115 --> 46:55.377
Not about who I am now.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.640
Not how I'm different now.

46:59.425 --> 47:02.428
That's what we should be
talking about, Paddy.

47:04.038 --> 47:05.605
Okay, okay.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.651
- We should take a break.
- We're not taking a break.

47:08.826 --> 47:09.870
<i>All right.</i>

47:11.045 --> 47:16.790
Okay, so, tell us...
what's changed, Arthur?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.489
Well, I'll tell you
what's changed, Paddy.

47:21.664 --> 47:23.753
I'm not alone anymore.

47:24.929 --> 47:26.626
Right.

47:26.800 --> 47:30.282
The girl who was singing.
The night you tried to escape.

47:30.456 --> 47:32.458
We weren't trying to escape.

47:32.632 --> 47:33.807
Miss Harley Quinzel.

47:36.244 --> 47:38.333
You two put on
quite a performance that night.

47:38.507 --> 47:39.639
Aww...

47:41.946 --> 47:43.861
She's really something,
isn't she?

47:44.818 --> 47:46.211
You tell me.

47:46.776 --> 47:48.561
I mean,
don't you think it's all...

47:50.693 --> 47:52.608
...don't you think
it's a little too much?

47:54.306 --> 47:55.916

51:03.277 --> 51:04.539
<i>will begin today.</i>

51:04.713 --> 51:06.324
<i>Assistant DA, Harvey Dent,</i>

51:06.498 --> 51:08.282
<i>is preparing
his opening remarks</i>

51:08.456 --> 51:10.371
<i>in what some are calling,
"The Trial of the Century."</i>

51:10.545 --> 51:12.417
<i>After months of protests,</i>

51:12.591 --> 51:14.680
<i>police will be on high alert,
closing surrounding streets,</i>

51:14.854 --> 51:16.377
<i>and setting up barricades
for crowds</i>

51:16.551 --> 51:18.205
<i>that could reach
in the thousands.</i>

51:18.379 --> 51:20.077
<i>If you ask me,
this is what you get</i>

51:20.251 --> 51:22.296
<i>when there's a complete
breakdown of social services.</i>

51:22.470 --> 51:25.430
<i>And don't get me started
on this media frenzy.</i>

51:25.604 --> 51:27.388
<i>All right, Denise,
you're on the air.</i>

51:27.562 --> 51:30.435
<i>Thank you for taking
my call. Enough is enough.</i>

51:30.609 --> 51:32.785
<i>This idiot
doesn't deserve a trial.</i>

51:32.959 --> 51:34.874
<i>He should be sent
straight to the chair.</i>

51:35.048 --> 51:36.441
<i>An example should be made
out of him.</i>

<i>Arthur Fleck...</i>

54:01.194 --> 54:02.848
Hey, shut the fuck up.

54:04.980 --> 54:05.894
Arthur.

54:06.068 --> 54:07.156
Milligan.

54:07.331 --> 54:08.636
Arthur.

54:08.810 --> 54:10.116
I'll split your head open.

54:24.130 --> 54:25.305
Yeah, Arthur.

54:28.003 --> 54:29.396
He's looking good.

54:31.833 --> 54:33.313
All rise.

54:33.487 --> 54:35.097
This court is now in session.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.491
The Honorable Judge
Herman Rothwax is presiding.

54:41.365 --> 54:42.975
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

54:44.063 --> 54:45.194
Please be seated.

54:47.893 --> 54:49.938
William,
please invite the jury in.

54:59.078 --> 55:00.688
Are you all right, Mr. Fleck?

55:03.212 --> 55:04.301
Everything okay?

55:06.085 --> 55:08.435
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm just looking for someone.

55:11.220 --> 55:13.310
Please, Mr. Fleck, sit down.

55:16.443 --> 55:19.011
I realize
there's a lot going on.

55:19.185 --> 55:21.796
But this is still
a court of law.

55:22.188 --> 55:25.060
Any and all outbursts
will not be tolerated.

55:25.452 --> 55:27.846
And that applies
to everyone in this courtroom.

55:28.325 --> 55:29.978
Sidney, please call the case.

56:46.751 --> 56:50.668
It's my view that there is
absolutely no evidence

56:50.842 --> 56:54.367
that Arthur Fleck suffers from
multiple personality disorder.

56:54.541 --> 56:58.980
Or that he ever behaved
in the role of "Joker,"

56:59.154 --> 57:04.072
as a separate personality
dissociated from himself.

57:04.812 --> 57:06.814
Doctor, in your opinion,

57:06.988 --> 57:09.600
concerning the work
you did on this case,

57:09.774 --> 57:14.735
do you believe Mr. Fleck suffers
from a mental disease or defect?

57:14.909 --> 57:17.477
No. In my opinion,

57:17.651 --> 57:22.482
he's not psychotic
or unable to test reality.

57:22.656 --> 57:25.572
I think he was sane
when he committed these crimes.

57:26.094 --> 57:29.968
In fact, I believe he fakes
his mental illness.

57:32.144 --> 57:33.188
Quiet.

57:36.496 --> 57:38.933
And... if he's, uh...

57:40.500 --> 57:42.502
...faking it, as you say,

57:43.634 --> 57:45.026
then what is your opinion

57:45.200 --> 57:48.508
on the defendant's
mental condition?

57:48.682 --> 57:51.163
I believe he has
four relatively minor

57:51.337 --> 57:54.035
and quite common
mental disorders

57:54.209 --> 57:57.778
that involve
long-standing sadness,

57:57.952 --> 58:02.043
narcissistic self-centeredness,
friendlessness,

58:02.217 --> 58:04.785
an indifference
to the feelings of others.

58:04.959 --> 58:07.440
This is
a very disturbed individual.

58:07.614 --> 58:12.576
But I can't give you any kind
of psychiatric defense for him.

58:12.967 --> 58:14.621
Thank you, Doctor Liu.

58:16.188 --> 58:17.494
Nothing further, Your Honor.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.106
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

58:21.846 --> 58:22.542
Thank you.

58:25.327 --> 58:27.852
Doctor Liu, good morning.

58:28.026 --> 58:29.027
Morning.

58:30.681 --> 58:32.509
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

58:32.813 --> 58:34.075
About two hours.

58:34.249 --> 58:35.642
About two hours.

58:36.904 --> 58:38.602
It was actually 89 minutes.

58:39.907 --> 58:42.823
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

58:42.997 --> 58:45.217
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

58:46.044 --> 58:49.177
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

58:49.351 --> 58:51.702
that this "Joker"

58:51.876 --> 58:55.923
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

58:56.097 --> 58:58.404
That that's not who he is.

58:58.578 --> 59:01.842
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

59:02.016 --> 59:06.673
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

59:06.847 --> 59:09.807
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

59:11.373 --> 59:12.549
Did you read the records

59:12.723 --> 59:14.812
from the
Department of Social Services...

59:16.117 --> 59:19.817
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

59:19.991 --> 59:21.993
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

59:24.038 --> 59:26.258
His mother's home.

59:26.432 --> 59:28.434
I did, yes.

59:29.566 --> 59:32.525
And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

59:33.526 --> 59:36.137
did you ask him
why Social Services

59:36.311 --> 59:38.705
didn't believe
the horrific stories

59:38.879 --> 59:41.752
a seven-year-old boy told them

59:41.926 --> 59:44.581
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

59:49.194 --> 59:52.110
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

59:52.284 --> 59:53.938
Hmm.

59:54.112 --> 59:56.897
So you want us to believe,

59:57.942 --> 01:00:03.121
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:07.386
and reading through
his records and tests

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.955
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:12.783
you want us to believe

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:16.351
that you can say
with absolute certainty

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:21.008
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:25.186
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.841
and create another identity

01:00:28.015 --> 01:00:33.978
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:37.111
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:41.725
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:44.858
when he was
attacked and tormented

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:48.296
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:54.520
<i>"After I woke up this morning,</i>

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:57.871
<i>I thought,
'Murray, Murray, Murray.'</i>

01:00:58.045 --> 01:01:00.613
And then there's Murray.

01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:02.049
Funny, right?

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:04.748
Then I remember Sophie.

01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:07.272
- I had anoth--"
- Objection. Your Honor...

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:10.188
Again, my client's
personal diary is privileged.

01:01:10.362 --> 01:01:11.885
Overruled.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:14.758
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:16.324
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:17.935
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:19.240
They weren't meant
to be read out loud.

01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:20.720
Mr. Fleck. Quiet!

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:25.159
These are your words
she's reading.

01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:26.552
And it's up to the jury

01:01:26.726 --> 01:01:28.162
to determine
what to make of them.

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.079
Please proceed.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.604
Ms. Kane,
please continue reading

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:38.303
from the, uh...
the highlighted portion.

01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:41.436
"Then I remember Sophie.

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.265
Had another dream about her.
Forgot it.

01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:47.573
<i>I almost never dream.</i>

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.097
What do I gotta do to remember?"

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.578
That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.798
whom he was obsessed with.

01:01:54.972 --> 01:01:55.712
What was that date?

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.279
November 17.

01:01:59.628 --> 01:02:01.718
Let the record show,

01:02:01.892 --> 01:02:04.851
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:07.724
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

01:02:08.768 --> 01:02:14.687
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:19.736
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.172
but you have read all of

01:02:21.346 --> 01:02:23.087
Mr. Fleck's journal before, correct?

01:02:23.261 --> 01:02:24.479
Yes, I have.

01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:27.308
And in your opinion,

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:30.877
does this sound
like a different voice?

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:36.317
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:39.581
No, it sounds like Arthur.

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.149
Go on.

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:45.239
He often wrote about
his fantasies.

01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:52.159
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:56.555
<i>And of course, his jokes.</i>

01:02:56.729 --> 01:03:00.820
<i>There were always
a lot of... these...</i>

01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:03.127
<i>these unfunny jokes.</i>

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:06.695
She's just a social worker.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.697
I don't think
she's even qualified--

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:10.438
You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.312
He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:16.880
Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

01:03:17.663 --> 01:03:19.273
Let's not do this here. Please?

01:03:19.447 --> 01:03:21.145
Do you see
all those people out front?

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.842
Who do you think
they're here for?

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:24.844
How many T-shirts
is Arthur Fleck on?

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.629
How many signs?

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.196
It's the Trial of the Century

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.633
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.114
- What do you mean by that?
- Can't you see how sick he is?

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:36.116
How much help he needs?

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:38.336
He's not sick.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.426
He's perfect.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.862
You don't really think
he's just gonna

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:44.908
walk out of here, do you?

01:03:45.082 --> 01:03:46.997
Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

01:03:47.649 --> 01:03:49.913
- With me by his side.
-  And then what?

01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:53.177
Any further statements?

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:55.179
And then we're gonna
build a mountain.

01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:57.659
-  A what?
- From a little hill.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.401
What does that even mean?

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:01.881
- Are you going to get married?
- Move!

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:05.842
You're not listening.

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:08.061
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:10.498
No, you're not listening.

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:12.196
Lee's looking out for me.

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.504
She understands
what I've been through.

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:18.289
What are you talking about?

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.161
We're from
the same neighborhood.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:25.383
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:26.906
She had her committed.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.474
So just give her a break.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.304
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:34.958
I know.

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:37.569
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

01:04:37.743 --> 01:04:40.702
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.923
Her father is not dead,
he's a doctor.

01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:46.273
She voluntarily
committed herself

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.666
to the hospital,

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.320
and then just
checked herself out

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:50.538
when she wanted to.

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:52.323
She didn't check herself out.

01:04:52.497 --> 01:04:54.151
Arthur.

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.718
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

01:04:59.547 --> 01:05:02.507
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:05.684
You wouldn't get it.

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:10.123
My point is she's playing you
for a fool.

01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:13.213
I'm sorry, I just--

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:17.174
I know what it's like
to love somebody.

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:19.785
But I don't think you can
believe a word she says.

What happened?

Well, you weren't even looking
at me anymore.

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:04.237
You were making it
all about yourself.

01:07:04.411 --> 01:07:06.761
And the song...

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:09.155
is about loving me!

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:13.333
Now look who's making it
all about themselves.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:14.900
Oh...

01:07:15.379 --> 01:07:17.076
So you're saying
it's not about us?

01:07:17.555 --> 01:07:20.645
It is, but we're singing
for them.

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:22.821
That's why we're here, honey.

01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:26.129
Oh! 'Cause I got
this sneaking suspicion

01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:28.653
that we're not giving the people
what they want.

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.959
It's okay baby, you're right.

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.572
Let's give the people
what they want.

01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:39.011
Music.
Let's take it from the top.

01:07:46.627 --> 01:07:48.064
Is the honeymoon over?

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.073
What?

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:01.947
Why'd you-- Why'd you do that?

01:08:11.174 --> 01:08:12.653
Pew!

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:14.916
Pew!

01:08:16.483 --> 01:08:17.919
-  Get Healey.
- Pew!

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:22.010
Ba-room!

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.627
Well, look at you.

01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:33.152
Couple of weeks back on TV
and already acting
like you own the joint.

01:08:33.326 --> 01:08:35.589
What the fuck are you two doing
sitting on our bleachers?

01:08:35.763 --> 01:08:37.504
Who said they're your bleachers?

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:40.116
Ricky, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

01:08:40.855 --> 01:08:42.814
You heard me. Up.

01:08:43.467 --> 01:08:45.121
Guess who I just saw out front?

01:08:46.905 --> 01:08:48.211
Your little lady friend.

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:51.823
All right, enough.
Get up, both of you.

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:54.130
Hey, Fleck, you got a visitor.

01:08:57.568 --> 01:08:59.222
See, Arthur? What'd I tell ya?

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:02.312
Move it!

01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:06.794
Every day, this asshole.

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:16.717
You're a real
fucking whack job, Fleck.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.591
Uh-uh!

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.041
Hey.

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.260
Five minutes.

01:09:42.308 --> 01:09:43.614
How are you holding up?

01:09:55.539 --> 01:09:57.236
Is everything okay?

01:10:04.112 --> 01:10:06.202
Did you-- Did you lie to me?

01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:11.772
Sure.

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:14.297
I mean, everybody lies a little.

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:21.434
And you're not from
the same neighborhood as me?

01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:23.697
And your...
your dad's a doctor?

01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:25.960
You're rich?

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.008
I just wanted you to like me.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:38.538
Did you really
check yourself in here?

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:41.454
Yeah.

01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:47.460
That's crazy.

01:10:50.028 --> 01:10:53.553
Just... because you wanted
to meet me?

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.816
Just to meet you.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.606
You could have just
wrote me a letter.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.306
And said what? I'm nobody.

01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:10.353
I haven't done anything
with my life like you have.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.749
Did you really watch
that TV movie

01:11:15.923 --> 01:11:17.882
they made about me 20 times?

01:11:18.056 --> 01:11:20.754
Um... probably more like
four or five.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.979
Was it actually good,
or did you lie about that too?

01:11:28.371 --> 01:11:29.850
It was great.

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:41.688
My lawyer... says you're
playing me for a fool.

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:44.648
I'm no fool.

01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.521
Can't you see what she's doing?

01:11:49.174 --> 01:11:50.828
They're laughing at you
in there.

01:11:53.613 --> 01:11:55.572
She doesn't care about you.

01:11:57.617 --> 01:11:58.836
I do.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.623
Do you know I moved
into your old apartment building

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:06.496
to make us a home
for when you get out?

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:08.802
Did your lawyer tell you that?

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:12.153
You did?

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.112
I don't want to live there.

01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:20.118
I'm pregnant.

Did you think

Or your daughter?

01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:05.501
I did, yes.

01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:09.940
You believed he was dangerous.

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:13.944
Well,
he broke into my apartment.

01:15:15.815 --> 01:15:17.077
You call the police?

01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:19.515
No.

01:15:21.473 --> 01:15:24.128
His mother told me, uh...

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:26.783
that he'd had problems
his whole life, but that he...

01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:28.611
wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:15:31.483 --> 01:15:32.745
And...

01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:38.577
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

01:15:39.099 --> 01:15:44.365
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:47.543
I didn't really know him.

01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:51.895
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:55.028
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:57.465
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.338
And Ms. Dumond,

01:16:00.773 --> 01:16:03.820
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

01:16:04.864 --> 01:16:08.172
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:12.089
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.527
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.356
And then I was a character

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:21.489
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:23.013
-  It was awful?
- Then all these people...

01:16:23.187 --> 01:16:24.667
No.

01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:27.191
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:31.499
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

01:16:31.891 --> 01:16:33.676
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:38.376
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:39.943
We moved out of the city.

01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:43.816
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.731
Because I should have
called the police that night.

01:16:48.386 --> 01:16:49.996
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:54.044
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.396
Thank you. No more questions.

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:01.704
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

01:17:04.445 --> 01:17:05.490
Ms. Dumond.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.929
What happened
after you asked Arthur

01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:12.323
to leave your apartment
that night?

01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:16.327
He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.895
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:20.548
you or your daughter?

01:17:22.289 --> 01:17:23.595
No.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.555
And did you watch him on TV
on <i>Murray Franklin</i>
the following week?

01:17:28.165 --> 01:17:29.514
I did.

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.299
And did that seem
like the same man

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:34.562
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:38.958
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

01:17:39.524 --> 01:17:42.048
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

01:17:43.963 --> 01:17:46.357
And while Arthur's mother

01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:49.621
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:51.710
what was she telling you
about her own son?

01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:57.455
Um...

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.807
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.375
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:07.465
and that he had this laugh.

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:09.772
She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.035
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.167
<i>"His dumb laugh."</i>

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:15.908
Yes.

01:18:16.866 --> 01:18:18.215
What else did she tell you?

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:24.525
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

01:18:25.526 --> 01:18:27.615
So that he would feel
better about it.

01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:29.008
So that he would stop crying,

01:18:29.182 --> 01:18:31.010
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:33.404
What was the story?

01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:37.060
That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.672
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

01:18:41.499 --> 01:18:42.282
And?

01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:45.024
And she...

01:18:45.198 --> 01:18:47.070
couldn't believe that
he based his whole life

01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:49.159
around this made-up story.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:52.205
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:57.167
She made fun of him
for doing that?

01:18:57.341 --> 01:18:59.082
She just thought
it was ridiculous

01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:00.605
that he thought
he could make people laugh.

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.607
I mean, she said Arthur
wasn't funny at all.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:06.567
<i>Did she tell you
that he had been</i>

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.395
<i>in and out of institutions
his whole life?</i>

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:10.658
<i>Yes.</i>

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:13.705
<i>Did she say
anything else about him?</i>

That he had never had
a girlfriend

01:22:10.186 --> 01:22:12.753
and she thought
he was probably a virgin.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.320
I can't do this.

01:22:15.017 --> 01:22:17.497
Oh! I can't do this anymore!

01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:19.238
<i>Your Honor, may I approach
the bench, please?</i>

01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:20.457
<i>No, you may not.</i>

01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:21.937
<i>I want to fire my lawyer.</i>

01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:22.676
<i>It's about time!</i>

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.287
<i>Excuse me?</i>

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.375
I'd like to represent myself.

01:22:25.549 --> 01:22:26.811
You're fired.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:29.596
Arthur, don't do this.
This is real.

01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:31.337
You'd better believe it's real.

01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:33.470
I want order in my court. Order!

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:38.605
Bailiff! Take Mr. Fleck
to his holding cell!

01:22:40.607 --> 01:22:41.565
<i>Order!</i>

01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:47.527
<i>I want to see all counsel
in my chambers immediately!</i>

01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:59.148
This way? Thank you.

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:05.371
Hey, no touching.

01:23:06.894 --> 01:23:08.896
I'm so fucking proud of you.

01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:18.732
You should see it out there.
They're all going crazy for you.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:22.910
You did it.

01:23:26.436 --> 01:23:30.005
I know, but maybe I should read
a law book or something.

01:23:31.441 --> 01:23:33.921
You know I never went
to high school?

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:38.622
I said, no touching.

01:23:44.889 --> 01:23:46.804
You can do anything you want.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:50.025
You're Joker.

01:24:14.658 --> 01:24:16.877
<i>Good evening,
it's 48 degrees at 6:00</i>

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.792
<i>on this Wednesday,
November 8th.</i>

01:24:18.966 --> 01:24:21.491
<i>I'm Stan L. Brooks
and here's what's happening.</i>

01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:22.927
<i>Shocking developments
at the trial</i>

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:25.364
<i>of Arthur Fleck downtown today.</i>

01:24:25.538 --> 01:24:28.237
<i>Fleck, the accused killer,
also known as Joker,</i>

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:30.108
<i>interrupted testimony</i>

01:24:30.282 --> 01:24:33.024
<i>and fired his lawyer
Maryanne Stewart in open court.</i>

01:24:33.198 --> 01:24:35.200
<i>Then he kissed her goodbye.</i>

01:24:35.374 --> 01:24:37.072
<i>Afterwards, Fleck
was extensively questioned</i>

01:24:37.246 --> 01:24:39.422
<i>by Judge Herman Rothwax.</i>

01:24:39.596 --> 01:24:41.946
<i>The right
of self-representation</i>

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.515
<i>is not a license to abuse
the dignity of the courtroom.</i>

01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:47.995
<i>Can you control your emotions,
Mr. Fleck?</i>

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.432
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:51.173
<i>Judge Rothwax reluctantly</i>

01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.697
<i>approved Fleck's request
to represent himself,</i>

01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:56.439
<i>as long as he agreed
to stand-by counsel.</i>

01:24:56.613 --> 01:24:58.615
<i>A decision that both Fleck's
now former attorney,</i>

01:24:58.789 --> 01:25:01.400
<i>Maryanne Stewart
and Assistant DA, Harvey Dent</i>

01:25:01.574 --> 01:25:02.880
<i>disagree with.</i>

01:25:03.054 --> 01:25:05.143
<i>It's really tragic.</i>

01:25:05.317 --> 01:25:07.711
<i>Arthur believes he has
all of these supporters,</i>

01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:09.974
<i>but they don't care about him.</i>

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:12.237
<i>They care about Joker.</i>

01:25:12.716 --> 01:25:14.848
<i>He's not dealing with reality.</i>

01:25:15.022 --> 01:25:17.242
<i>He's mentally ill.</i>

01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:18.896
<i>If we could have
just convinced him of that</i>

01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:20.593
<i>then we would have won
this case.</i>

01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.247
<i>Fleck knows what he's doing.</i>

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:23.944
<i>He knows he's losing.</i>

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.512
<i>We cannot forget
that he's evil.</i>

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:29.211
<i>This is all just
part of his plan.</i>

01:25:29.385 --> 01:25:32.257
<i>The Arthur Fleck trial
will resume on Monday morning.</i>

01:25:32.431 --> 01:25:34.172
<i>In other news,
Mayor Thorndike...</i>

01:25:36.653 --> 01:25:38.307
There he is.

01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:39.960
All right, calm down, everybody.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.266
Hey, shut the fuck up!

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.790

01:25:45.705 --> 01:25:47.446

-  Yeah, Arthur!

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.622
Hey, come on. Get off the table.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:51.972

After reviewing all the case law

<i>Jensen v. Superior Court</i>
being the most relevant,

01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:09.180
I have reluctantly decided

01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:12.183
that Mr. Fleck
does have the right

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:15.447
as an attorney,
to dress himself how he likes...

01:27:17.014 --> 01:27:18.537
...as long as he doesn't
cause disorder

01:27:18.711 --> 01:27:21.801
or interfere with
the functioning of the Court.

01:27:22.759 --> 01:27:24.543
<i>I will not allow

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.634
<i>And I will not let you</i>

01:27:28.808 --> 01:27:30.984
<i>turn this into
any more of a circus</i>

01:27:31.158 --> 01:27:32.377
<i>than you already have.</i>

01:27:32.551 --> 01:27:34.684
Thank you.

01:27:34.858 --> 01:27:37.643
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:44.041
The State calls Gary Puddles.

01:27:44.737 --> 01:27:46.173
Bailiff?

01:27:46.348 --> 01:27:48.175
Will you please escort
Mr. Puddles to the stand?

01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:10.372
Gary.

01:28:13.897 --> 01:28:15.507
Go get 'em.

01:28:42.404 --> 01:28:43.579
Please raise your right hand.

01:28:46.408 --> 01:28:47.800
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

01:28:47.974 --> 01:28:49.585
you're about to give
is the whole truth

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:52.152
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.371
I do.

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.768
Good morning, Mr. Puddles.

01:28:58.942 --> 01:29:00.596
Thank you for being here.

01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:06.689
So one last question, sir.

01:29:06.863 --> 01:29:09.518
The person who you saw

01:29:09.692 --> 01:29:11.824
stab Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death,

01:29:13.783 --> 01:29:15.306
are they in this courtroom
here today?

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.612
Yes.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.092
Can you point him out
to all of us?

01:29:19.528 --> 01:29:23.227
And... describe his clothing?

01:29:25.142 --> 01:29:27.710
He's... He's sitting right there
at the table.

01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:31.235
Wearing a red suit
and clown make-up.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.977
May the record reflect

01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:36.545
the identification
of the accused, Your Honor?

01:29:37.197 --> 01:29:38.068
Yes, it will.

01:29:39.286 --> 01:29:40.462
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:29:43.726 --> 01:29:45.380
Your witness, Mr. Fleck.

01:29:54.258 --> 01:29:56.478
Mr. Puddles.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.830
Gary Puddles?

01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:06.052
Tell me, sir,
is that your God-given name?

01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:08.490
Yes.

01:30:09.186 --> 01:30:10.448
Really?

01:30:11.188 --> 01:30:14.147
Really?
Your last name is Puddles?

01:30:16.802 --> 01:30:20.458
Why, it sounds like a... a joke.

01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:21.981
Well, it's not.

01:30:24.244 --> 01:30:26.943
You expect us to believe
that your last name is Puddles?

01:30:27.117 --> 01:30:28.379
Puddles?

01:30:28.553 --> 01:30:31.251
Mr. Fleck, where is this going?

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:35.168
As I said, I'm not gonna let you
turn my courtroom into a circus.

01:30:35.342 --> 01:30:36.779
Okay.

01:30:36.953 --> 01:30:39.912
But, um, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

01:30:40.086 --> 01:30:42.132
don't you think
it's a little late for that?

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.873
- Don't try my patience.
-  Okay. Okay.

01:30:47.006 --> 01:30:49.574
Mr. Puddles...

01:30:50.532 --> 01:30:53.535
earlier this afternoon
you testified

01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:56.799
that you saw me stab
Mr. Kliman Manhoff

01:30:56.973 --> 01:31:00.237
in the neck a couple of times.
Correct?

01:31:01.107 --> 01:31:01.978
Kleinmanhoffer.

01:31:02.935 --> 01:31:05.024
Yes, I saw you.

01:31:05.198 --> 01:31:06.635
Mm.

01:31:06.809 --> 01:31:10.073
And what else
did you see that day?

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.512
You stabbing him in the eye,

01:31:14.686 --> 01:31:17.080
and bashing his head
into the wall,

01:31:17.254 --> 01:31:19.865
many, many times.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:24.783
Yes, but, uh, Randall
was a bit of a bully, wasn't he?

01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:27.917
He didn't deserve to die.

01:31:30.049 --> 01:31:31.834
I don't know.

01:31:32.008 --> 01:31:33.313
Eh, never mind.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:36.229
Gary, did you catch my act

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:38.667
on <i>The Murray Franklin Show</i>
later that night?

01:31:39.145 --> 01:31:40.364
No, I didn't.

01:31:40.538 --> 01:31:41.626
No?

01:31:42.453 --> 01:31:46.065
Might I remind you
that you are under oath?

01:31:46.239 --> 01:31:48.111
I was locked up
at the police station.

01:31:48.285 --> 01:31:49.852
In an interview room.

01:31:50.853 --> 01:31:53.116
'Cause they thought
you might come and kill me.

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:55.727
I was the only witness.

01:31:55.901 --> 01:31:57.686
They kept me in there all night.

01:31:59.035 --> 01:32:02.168
Isn't that convenient,
Mr. Puddles?

01:32:02.342 --> 01:32:05.084
That you didn't see the show,
you didn't see anything
I had to say,

01:32:05.258 --> 01:32:06.651
I can't believe it!

01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:08.000
Mr. Fleck.

01:32:08.435 --> 01:32:09.872
Okay.

01:32:11.787 --> 01:32:14.354
Uh, when you were
in my mama's apartment,

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:16.400
God rest her soul,

01:32:16.574 --> 01:32:20.752
when, as you say, you saw me
bash Mr. Klannonmen--

01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:25.540
whatever's-- head into the wall,
"many, many times,"

01:32:27.237 --> 01:32:28.804
did I seem crazy to you?

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.939
Did I seem
like a different person?

01:32:34.113 --> 01:32:40.772
Or was I the same old Joker
that I always been?

01:32:42.426 --> 01:32:45.777
Arthur, don't do this
to yourself, it isn't you.

01:32:46.212 --> 01:32:49.607
It isn't me?
So you don't think this is me?

01:32:49.781 --> 01:32:53.437
Well, maybe... maybe...
you don't know who I really was.

01:32:56.309 --> 01:32:57.789
I never saw that side of you.

01:32:57.963 --> 01:32:59.530
Well, maybe you weren't looking.

01:33:00.357 --> 01:33:01.924
Maybe no one was.

01:33:02.098 --> 01:33:05.884
Because nobody knew I existed.

01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:08.452
But look around,
look at all these people.

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:12.151
Everyone outside. These cameras.

01:33:12.325 --> 01:33:15.328
Who do you think they see,
Mr. Puddles?

01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:18.157
Joker.

01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:22.988
Oh, sweet child,

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.907
what you have proven here today,
is that you are no different

01:33:29.081 --> 01:33:32.041
than any of those people
that underestimated me.

01:33:32.215 --> 01:33:33.956
<i>From Murray Franklin,</i>

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:38.482
<i>to those goddamn fat,
stupid guards at Arkham.</i>

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:40.832
<i>They think that
they can treat me like trash.</i>

01:33:41.006 --> 01:33:42.399
<i>But I will no longer allow you,</i>

01:33:42.573 --> 01:33:44.531
<i>or you, or you,</i>

01:33:44.706 --> 01:33:47.796
<i>or any of you to keep me down.</i>

01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:50.189
<i>I am free!</i>

01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:56.848
Why are you doing this
to me, Arthur?

01:33:57.544 --> 01:33:58.328
What?

01:33:59.285 --> 01:34:00.722
Gary, I like you.

01:34:01.461 --> 01:34:03.942
I told you I wouldn't hurt you,
and I didn't.

01:34:04.116 --> 01:34:05.422
Not hurt me?

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.339
I couldn't go back to work.

01:34:10.209 --> 01:34:14.126
I still can't sleep,
and I'm scared all the time.

01:34:15.345 --> 01:34:17.260
I never used to be scared.

01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:21.960
I'm scared right now, here.
With you in front of me.

01:34:24.354 --> 01:34:27.096
I couldn't do anything that day.

01:34:27.966 --> 01:34:30.490
I felt so small.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.669
I was reminded
how powerless I really am.

01:34:36.627 --> 01:34:39.499
Oh... you got
a flair for the dramatic.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:42.328
You are tugging at
my heart strings, little Gary.

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:48.465
No more-- no more questions,
Your Honor.

01:34:49.596 --> 01:34:52.034
Do you know
what that feels like, Arthur?

01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:53.905
Oh, fuck!

01:34:54.079 --> 01:34:58.083
You were the only one at work
who never made fun of me.

01:34:58.997 --> 01:35:01.260
You were the only one
that was nice to me.

01:35:04.133 --> 01:35:07.092
I said, no more questions,
Your Honor!

01:35:11.488 --> 01:35:13.446
Very well, Mr. Puddles.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.448
The court thanks you
for your testimony.

01:35:17.494 --> 01:35:19.583
Please step down,
you're excused.

01:35:34.293 --> 01:35:35.947
Mr. Dent,
call your next witness.

01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:40.691
We're not calling
any more witnesses, Your Honor.

01:35:41.692 --> 01:35:43.520
That is the State's case.

01:35:43.694 --> 01:35:44.782
The State rests.

01:35:45.696 --> 01:35:46.610
Very well.

01:35:47.829 --> 01:35:49.395
All right, Mr. Fleck,

01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:52.224
at this point,
you may mount your defense.

01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:57.621
The defense rests as well,
Your Honor.

01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:00.493
Pardon?

01:36:01.451 --> 01:36:04.846
Mr. Fleck, you don't want
to put on any defense?

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:07.892
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

01:36:08.327 --> 01:36:10.547
"Th-Th-Th-That's all folks."

01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:12.592
All right, all right.

01:36:14.159 --> 01:36:15.204
All right.

01:36:17.249 --> 01:36:19.425
<i>That's enough!
This is a court of law!</i>

01:36:22.211 --> 01:36:24.343
<i>With both sides having rested,</i>

01:36:25.388 --> 01:36:29.305
<i>this court will recess
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.</i>

01:36:29.479 --> 01:36:32.047
You made our case
for us, you fucking idiot!

01:36:32.221 --> 01:36:33.526
You're gonna fry
for killing my son!

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.006
Burn in hell!

01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:36.529
Anything you want to say?

01:36:36.703 --> 01:36:37.879
Arthur, will you be convicted?

01:36:38.053 --> 01:36:39.315
Arthur, over here.

01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:40.707
Let's see that smile.

01:36:40.882 --> 01:36:42.144
Where do you think you stand,
Arthur?

01:36:45.974 --> 01:36:47.584
What are you
gonna do if they let you off?

I told him,

I'm only working
four of these days.

01:40:17.489 --> 01:40:18.273
Good for you.

01:40:52.481 --> 01:40:53.395
Joe, how goes it?

01:40:53.569 --> 01:40:55.527
You know, same old bullshit.

01:40:55.701 --> 01:40:56.615
Joker.

01:40:56.789 --> 01:40:57.747
How's Kathy?

01:40:57.921 --> 01:40:58.878
Is that really him?

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:00.054
Still busting my balls.

01:41:00.793 --> 01:41:01.403
Yeah, they always do.

01:41:01.577 --> 01:41:02.360
Yep.

01:41:06.147 --> 01:41:07.017
See you fellas in the morning.

01:41:11.587 --> 01:41:12.544
Give 'em hell, man.

01:41:13.371 --> 01:41:14.633
Uh-oh.

01:41:15.547 --> 01:41:16.635
I'm in trouble.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.724
What?

01:41:19.812 --> 01:41:20.857
Move.

01:41:21.031 --> 01:41:22.163
Easy, darling.

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.388
Why is everyone
so upset with me?

01:41:30.562 --> 01:41:31.737
Move your ass.

01:41:33.304 --> 01:41:34.349
Come on, Arthur.

01:41:36.612 --> 01:41:38.440
I'm an attorney now!

01:41:38.614 --> 01:41:40.485
- I will see you in court.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:41:40.659 --> 01:41:42.052
And I'm the fucking
Queen of Sheba.

01:41:42.226 --> 01:41:43.706
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

01:41:46.448 --> 01:41:47.188
Yeah?

01:41:48.363 --> 01:41:49.494
Get up!

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:51.061
Grab his legs, Mac.

01:41:52.932 --> 01:41:53.846
Let's go.

01:41:55.674 --> 01:41:58.286
Had to go and be
a big shot on TV.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.722
I think he knocked himself out.

01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:04.335
Motherfucker.

01:42:07.208 --> 01:42:07.991
Stand him up.

01:42:12.474 --> 01:42:15.651
All right, I get it.
I get it, Jackie.

01:42:16.042 --> 01:42:17.870
You wanna--
You wanna hear a joke, right?

01:42:18.044 --> 01:42:19.611
You really think...

01:42:19.785 --> 01:42:21.352
...fancy red suit

01:42:21.526 --> 01:42:23.833
and muck on your face
makes you better than us?

01:42:24.486 --> 01:42:27.315
You have no fucking idea
what it takes,

01:42:27.489 --> 01:42:30.448
put a little bit of joy
into this fucking place.

01:42:30.622 --> 01:42:33.103
Let me tell you one I used to do
about my mother.

01:42:33.277 --> 01:42:34.539
You can drop the act now.

01:42:34.713 --> 01:42:35.888
- My mother was...
- Because we know

01:42:36.062 --> 01:42:37.934
it's only Arthur in there, okay?

01:42:38.108 --> 01:42:40.371
And she only dated abusive guys.

01:42:40.545 --> 01:42:41.459
Yeah, is that right?

02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:11.160
- Fuck!
- Calm down, man.

02:00:13.771 --> 02:00:15.512
This is just
the beginning, man.

02:00:15.686 --> 02:00:18.907
They're gonna burn
the whole fucking city down now.

02:00:23.955 --> 02:00:26.871
No, no. Wait.
Wait, don't do this, man.

02:00:27.394 --> 02:00:29.309
Come on, man.
Get back inside.

02:00:29.483 --> 02:00:30.527
Get in. Get in.

02:00:35.010 --> 02:00:38.579
-  Hey, hey, hey!
-  Come back!

02:00:39.406 --> 02:00:41.625
Come back, man. Joker.

02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:45.977
Fuck.

02:00:46.151 --> 02:00:47.327
No!

02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:48.850
Where are you going, man?

02:00:49.416 --> 02:00:50.591
We still love you.

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.593
We love you, Joker.

02:00:52.984 --> 02:00:54.203
Joker!

02:00:57.728 --> 02:00:59.208
Joker!

02:01:31.501 --> 02:01:32.589
Lee?

02:01:37.507 --> 02:01:38.378
Lee!

02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:05.579
Look at you.

02:02:08.756 --> 02:02:09.844
You cut your hair.

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:21.377
Someone blew up the courthouse,
and I'm free.

02:02:24.685 --> 02:02:26.121
We can go away.

02:02:32.693 --> 02:02:34.216
Lee, you hear me?

02:02:35.086 --> 02:02:37.001
Someone blew up the courthouse.

02:02:37.175 --> 02:02:38.133
We can go.

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.484
I escaped.

02:02:43.965 --> 02:02:45.662
We're not going away, Arthur.

02:02:48.012 --> 02:02:51.059
All we had was the fantasy,
and you gave up.

02:02:54.062 --> 02:02:55.542
We were never going anywhere.

02:03:02.636 --> 02:03:04.377
I'm that same guy
you fell in love with.

02:03:06.553 --> 02:03:09.382
I'm the same guy
that murdered Murray Franklin.

02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:11.384
No.

02:03:13.037 --> 02:03:14.082
No, you're not.

02:03:15.562 --> 02:03:17.259
There is no Joker.

02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:19.783
That's what you said, isn't it?

02:03:28.052 --> 02:03:29.837
I can't--

02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:32.579
I can't--
I can't live without you.

02:03:36.234 --> 02:03:38.759

Okay.

02:06:33.237 --> 02:06:35.892
So, a psychopath walks
into a bar,

02:06:36.066 --> 02:06:38.765
and sees this famous clown
sitting there all alone.

02:06:39.243 --> 02:06:40.854
Totally drunk, it's pathetic.

02:06:41.768 --> 02:06:43.944
"I can't believe you're here,"
he says.

02:06:44.466 --> 02:06:49.123
"What a disappointment.
I used to watch you on TV.

02:06:50.646 --> 02:06:52.343
What can I get you?"

02:06:52.517 --> 02:06:54.781
And this clown turns and says,

02:06:55.912 --> 02:06:58.785
"Well, if you're buying
you can get me anything."

02:07:01.309 --> 02:07:03.616
"Perfect," the psychopath says.

02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:05.792
"How about I get you
what you fucking deserve?"
