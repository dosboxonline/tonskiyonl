is with a laparotomy.

05:49.833 --> 05:52.458
A little respect for my "inept science"
might be due.

05:53.250 --> 05:56.166
A laparoscopy allows me
to see the ovaries, the fallopian tubes,

05:56.250 --> 05:57.875
and other parts of the reproductive tract

05:57.958 --> 06:01.125
without having to make anything more
than very small incisions in the skin.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.750
Laparoscopy is
an extremely dangerous technique.

06:03.833 --> 06:04.666

This is Jean Purdy.
She'll be running our lab.

06:44.916 --> 06:46.625
Will she now? Good luck to you both.

06:46.708 --> 06:47.541
With your equipment,

06:47.625 --> 06:50.166
we'd be able to access a woman's ovaries
in the least invasive way.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.708
Oldham is an extremely good hospital,

06:51.791 --> 06:54.000

in London available.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.750

06:58.708 --> 06:59.833
Have you studied me?

06:59.916 --> 07:04.125
No, I have. She's repeating it to you
in an effort to get you to listen to me.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.083

07:11.833 --> 07:13.208
What heating problem?

07:13.291 --> 07:17.541
Look, I've gotta get back to Oldham.
I'm late for the 3:25. Write to me.

07:17.625 --> 07:20.750
3:25? That gives us a good half hour.
We'll walk with you.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.333
During the laparoscopy,
you need a light source for your camera.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.708
Otherwise, you are literally
poking around in the dark.

07:25.791 --> 07:29.291
But bulbs heat things up, so how are you
not cooking the insides of these women?

07:29.375 --> 07:30.958
[Patrick] West Germans have a laparoscope

07:31.041 --> 07:33.458
in which light is conducted
from a mirror projection lamp.

07:33.541 --> 07:34.875
No bulbs. No cooking.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.583
-Didn't I tell you he was brilliant?
-The West Germans are brilliant.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.333
We share the same aim. We want to address
the problem of infertility.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.666
Trouble is, your science has its limits,
and so does ours.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.083
Go ahead. Tell me my limits.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.791
I believe, you have just developed
a procedure to place sperm

07:46.875 --> 07:48.125
inside the fallopian tube.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.958
-Where'd you read that?
-It won't get results.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.875
Not substantial ones.
Why? Because sperm can't behave itself.

07:52.958 --> 07:57.083
But imagine if we could place
a fertilized egg inside that same tube.

07:57.583 --> 07:58.916
You remove an egg,

07:59.000 --> 08:00.791
using your marvelous equipment
and know-how.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.416
You give it to us,
we fertilize that egg outside the body,

08:03.500 --> 08:05.416
using our marvelous equipment
and know-how,

08:05.500 --> 08:07.166
and then you place it back inside.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.000
The chances of a successful pregnancy
will just go through the roof.

08:10.083 --> 08:13.500

You truly believe you can do that?

24:04.041 --> 24:06.750
You know, there were remnants found
in Egyptian tombs.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.708
They used to stuff
their leftover meat scraps

24:09.791 --> 24:11.125
into cow intestines.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.416
You are aware
I'm really not good with silence?

24:22.416 --> 24:23.916
[quietly] So get good with it.

24:30.250 --> 24:31.833
Right. I think that's everyone.

24:31.916 --> 24:36.583
We'll need you to report daily
to Kershaw's for your hormone injection.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.541
This is to stimulate your egg production.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.291
Once we have stimulated it,

24:40.375 --> 24:43.166
we'll harvest your eggs
and add your husband's sperm.

24:43.250 --> 24:46.750
If fertilization occurs,
we'll implant the embryo into you.

24:47.958 --> 24:49.750
If you have any concerns, do raise them.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.166
"Kathy Gibson."

24:57.541 --> 24:58.541
We'll start with you.

25:04.541 --> 25:07.458
We will be injecting
into your bottom today,

25:07.541 --> 25:10.791
so if you could lower your skirt
and tights and lean over the bed.

25:10.875 --> 25:11.708
Okay.

25:15.833 --> 25:18.125
[Matron] You are either with us
or you're not.

25:18.208 --> 25:19.541
Not today, Muriel, please.

25:19.625 --> 25:23.541
If it's a boy, leave him at the door.
If it's money trouble, maybe we can help.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.625
If it's something more serious,
we're in a hospital.

25:25.708 --> 25:28.000
I really don't want
a lecture right now, Muriel.

25:28.083 --> 25:28.958

25:30.291 --> 25:32.250
I am Matron.

25:33.333 --> 25:37.083
You may dismiss it as a title,
but it means the world to me.

25:40.958 --> 25:43.750
I didn't know you did abortions, Matron.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.750
I'm a Christian. My mother would--

25:45.833 --> 25:47.750
The other consultants say no.

25:48.666 --> 25:50.375
So Mr. Steptoe has to do them all.

25:50.458 --> 25:51.833
But he doesn't… have to.

25:53.625 --> 25:56.208
Do you know how many girls
come in here with their insides torn

25:56.291 --> 25:58.500
because they've gone
to a man on a street corner?

26:01.708 --> 26:02.791
I didn't think so.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.083
I thought we were here to make babies.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.083
Well, you're wrong.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.083
We are here to give women choice.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.791
Every choice.

So, Dr. Edwards, what do you think
of Professor Watson's claim

26:34.666 --> 26:38.166
that what you're doing here
is extremely dangerous?

26:38.250 --> 26:41.500
That it may lead to a future
in which humans could be manufactured?

just about stirring the pot?

27:34.541 --> 27:37.708

That could be his breakthrough.

28:00.583 --> 28:01.875

28:02.583 --> 28:05.333

-I'm committed.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.583
it felt very hard to me.

36:35.666 --> 36:39.583
You don't see your wife or kids.
I've lost my church and my mum.

36:40.666 --> 36:44.375
Then I saw those so-called scientists
sitting there, passing judgment on us,

36:44.458 --> 36:47.000
and I realized,
no one else is going to do this.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.625
This fight is ours.
We don't have a choice.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.083
[expectant music playing]

36:51.166 --> 36:53.958
-What happened in there just proved it.
-Come on, Bob.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.833
Kershaw's isn't as bad as all that, is it?

36:59.750 --> 37:01.166
[Jean] The decor's terrible.

37:02.125 --> 37:04.125
But the company's occasionally okay.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.625
[Patrick laughs]

37:08.125 --> 37:11.375
Don't you two start getting on.
She's my friend.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.166
[Patrick laughs]

37:15.583 --> 37:17.166
[indistinct chatter]

37:18.125 --> 37:19.250
[Jean] Trisha Johnson?

37:25.833 --> 37:27.333
You never bring your husband here.

37:27.416 --> 37:28.333
[music fades out]

37:28.416 --> 37:31.083
-Sorry?
-Your husband, he's never here.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.250
[scoffs softly]

37:33.333 --> 37:35.416
He says he's done with chasing rainbows.

37:36.625 --> 37:37.875
Is he a good man?

37:38.458 --> 37:39.291
[tuts]

37:39.916 --> 37:41.166
Mm. He wanted a boy.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.416
He whispered on our wedding day,

37:43.500 --> 37:46.083
"I can't wait to tell Stu
how beautiful you looked today."

37:46.666 --> 37:47.500
Stuart?

37:48.083 --> 37:49.958
-[chuckles] D'you mind if we…
-Sorry.

38:00.416 --> 38:02.291
He's nice Monday through Thursday.

38:03.791 --> 38:05.291
Likes a drink on Friday.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.708
Don't tell me you haven't seen
the bruises. I won't believe you.

38:09.791 --> 38:13.500
I noticed. I, uh… I just wasn't sure
you'd want to be asked about them.

38:16.125 --> 38:16.958
I'm not…

38:19.333 --> 38:20.291
This isn't for him.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.875
I just want someone for me.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.208
Sorry. [sobs] Sorry.

38:28.041 --> 38:31.333
Asking you not to treat us like cattle,
and I'm treating you like a handkerchief.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.875
I should have listened better. I'm sorry.

38:34.791 --> 38:37.041
I know what you're all going through, and…

38:37.125 --> 38:38.416
[breathes deeply]

38:41.791 --> 38:44.208
We've taken to calling ourselves
"the Ovum Club."

38:44.833 --> 38:45.666
The girls.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.333
-The Ovum Club?
-Hmm.

38:48.875 --> 38:49.875
I like that.

38:51.958 --> 38:53.000
I'll send Rachel in.

39:01.875 --> 39:04.291
-[Rachel] Hi.
-How are you, Rachel?

39:04.375 --> 39:05.958
-Grand. How are you?
-I'm good.

39:08.666 --> 39:10.375
[footsteps approaching]

39:11.875 --> 39:12.833
Results through?

39:14.791 --> 39:17.041
[Bob] Failure on case number 136.

39:17.625 --> 39:18.583
Kathy.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.166
It's not working.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.375
The HCG is setting
the other natural ovarian hormones awry.

39:23.458 --> 39:25.708
The estrogen and progesterone
are all over the place.

39:25.791 --> 39:27.791
There's no chance of implantation.

39:28.375 --> 39:30.750
We could try artificially boosting

39:30.833 --> 39:33.541
the estrogen and the progesterone
for the next one.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.583
[Patrick] We could.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.208
[Bob] Hold on.
We should start preparing the solutions.

39:38.291 --> 39:40.416
I need to speak to Kathy. She'll be upset.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.041
[poignant music playing]

39:47.208 --> 39:48.708
-[Jean] Kathy.
-Hi, Jean.

39:48.791 --> 39:51.375
-[Jean] Hi. How are you?
-I'm okay.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.875
We've just had a look at the results.

39:58.916 --> 39:59.916
I'm really sorry.

40:01.625 --> 40:02.791
We weren't successful.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.416
[inaudible chatter]

40:10.666 --> 40:12.791
-[Patrick] Anything to report?
-[glass clinking]

40:12.875 --> 40:15.416
If you're looking for success,
you'll find nothing here.

[music fades out]

40:23.083 --> 40:23.916
[Patrick sighs]

40:26.750 --> 40:28.958
Do you… want my help?

40:29.750 --> 40:34.375
-Why would I need your help?
-I don't want to assume or… interfere.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.875
I know privacy is important to you, but I…

40:37.750 --> 40:41.333
I also know we've never talked
about your situation and children.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.708
I suppose I may have made an assumption

40:44.791 --> 40:49.291
that there are, or you think there are,
difficulties that you too might face.

40:56.875 --> 40:58.125
Endometriosis.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.333
And it's severe.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.875
-Have you talked to someone?
-Once. He wasn't much use.

41:06.958 --> 41:10.083
-Will you allow me to examine you?
-No. [chuckles softly]

41:11.958 --> 41:13.916
I'm not bad at this.
I may be able to help.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.625
You're the best surgeon, Patrick.
I don't doubt that.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.541
It's amazing what science can do.

41:21.625 --> 41:24.166
Yes, well… let's keep working
on that science.

-We haven't got the time.
-They've asked James Watson on too.

Journalism won't give us
an answer here. Science will.

We won't shift the Research Council
without public support.

We won't get public support
till we've some success to show.

I know that I made
a mess of it… before, but I…

45:32.458 --> 45:33.791
Bob, you're a brilliant scientist.

45:33.875 --> 45:37.041
But I'm not the most polished on TV,
and I have a… foolish tendency

45:37.125 --> 45:41.291
to not suffer fools, I know, but…
I will be better this time, I promise.

45:41.375 --> 45:44.041
When we make these sort of decisions,
we should have a veto system.

-I really don't think you should.
-Jean, what do you think?

Oh, television, I mean. Television.

Actually, I wouldn't say that
about television either.

Professor James Watson and…

46:17.375 --> 46:18.916
[audience applauding]

46:33.333 --> 46:36.166
So, uh, Professor Watson,
if I may start with you.

46:36.250 --> 46:39.625
You're opposed to these developments,
am I right?

46:39.708 --> 46:42.791
Oh, I am… never opposed
to developments in science,

46:42.875 --> 46:44.583
but I am concerned.

46:45.208 --> 46:48.166
The question is one of abnormality.

46:48.250 --> 46:52.541
Imagine the life of an abnormal child,
born as a result of this,

46:53.250 --> 46:56.833
kept alive by,
indeed made possible, by medicine.

46:57.416 --> 47:00.500
The question will arise
what to do with that child.

47:01.250 --> 47:04.333
Allow it to live a disabled life, in pain,

47:05.041 --> 47:07.875
or consider
the possibility of infanticide?

47:07.958 --> 47:11.791
This is not about… this is not about
killing children. It is about making them.

47:11.875 --> 47:15.250
Uh, Dr… Dr. Edwards,
please allow Professor Watson to finish.

47:16.083 --> 47:20.000
I come from a generation of scientists
born under the shadow of Mengele.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.500
I'm concerned that
we are stumbling into a situation

47:23.583 --> 47:26.791
where the work we do
might lead to similar abhorrence.

47:26.875 --> 47:30.041
-I'm a Nazi doctor now, am I?
-No. [chuckles]

47:30.125 --> 47:34.666
You're a scientist seemingly unengaged
in the consequences of your work.

47:34.750 --> 47:36.416
-[applause]
-[man 2] He's right!

47:37.208 --> 47:39.083
[host] Dr. Edwards, respond.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.916
Science is a risk. All of it.

47:42.583 --> 47:45.583
His discovery of DNA presents great risks.

47:45.666 --> 47:48.666
-Genetic engineering--
-This is not a debate on DNA.

47:48.750 --> 47:52.916
Genetic engineering is a possibility
born of the discovery of DNA.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.750
A discovery he deservedly won
the Nobel Prize for.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.791
There are risks. Of course there are.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.208
But calculated risk is vital
in our discipline, as you well know.

48:04.291 --> 48:05.125
[audience murmurs]

48:05.208 --> 48:07.583
Our care for our patients
is absolute, and we--

48:07.666 --> 48:09.625

48:09.708 --> 48:11.458
-It's wrong!
-[man 4] It's disgustin'!

48:11.541 --> 48:13.250
Please let Dr. Edwards speak.

48:14.458 --> 48:17.083
Having children is not everything.
I know that.

48:17.166 --> 48:20.125
Some people lead
very happy lives childless.

48:20.875 --> 48:23.083
But that should be a choice.

48:23.166 --> 48:24.625
[woman] It's nature's choice!

48:24.708 --> 48:27.416
[Bob] Statistically, most people
in this room must know someone

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500

Uh, a sister, a cousin, an… an aunt.

48:31.791 --> 48:33.750
-Uh, a… a friend.
-No! No!

48:33.833 --> 48:37.000
If you knew the pain of infertility
for these women,

48:37.083 --> 48:41.250
then you would understand that
the risk-reward ratio in the study of IVF

48:41.333 --> 48:43.083
is overwhelmingly stacked…

48:43.166 --> 48:44.791

-I believe Philip Hayton is live in--
-I… I believe… I…

48:47.333 --> 48:50.375
I believe that everyone who wants one

48:50.458 --> 48:53.208
deserves the right to have a child.

Me and my younger brother.

49:37.583 --> 49:38.958
We were both so scared.

49:39.666 --> 49:41.458
But then, when we got here, it…

49:44.833 --> 49:47.000
I didn't know
how beautiful things could be.

49:47.791 --> 49:48.708
Peace.

49:49.833 --> 49:50.666
Sheep.

49:52.083 --> 49:53.541
[chuckles] Lots of sheep.

49:53.625 --> 49:55.583
Sheep were the beauty, were they?

-[Muriel] Yes?
-[Bob] Can I speak to Patrick?

51:00.833 --> 51:02.750
Yes. It's Dr. Edwards.

-[Patrick] I saw you on television.
-Patrick, it's not the time for--

51:09.666 --> 51:12.250
[Patrick] That tie with that suit,
that didn't help the cause.

presumably it's the extra hormones.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:55.458
-I don't know.
-That pregnancy could've worked.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:58.833
Maybe others, even if we'd just…
If we hadn't been poisoning these women.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:00.666
-Oh, Jean.
-Are you blaming me?

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.291
No! I'm blaming me!

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.416
[Jean] Please don't. It was a mistake.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.875
There… there will be others.

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:12.666
There wouldn't have been a pregnancy.
We weren't ready.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:16.416
What are you doing? Stop. Stop. Stop!

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.916
This is too important to…

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.500
[tense music playing]

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:27.333
-Hey, now you're the one being crazy.
-[Jean] Maybe… we… both are.

01:04:27.416 --> 01:04:28.625
Eh, Bob?

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.541
My mother is dying.

01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:35.250
And here I am, staying awake all night,
with a madman and his shitty liquids!

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.291
This was a beautiful dream.

01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:47.166
[inhales sharply] And I…
I really did believe in it.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:51.333
But all this,
it's cost me everything, and I can't.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:52.958
[poignant music plays]

01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:11.625
Mum!

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:19.000
Mum! I've left work!
I'm giving up my flat!

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:22.541
If you don't let me in,
I'll have to sleep on your doorstep!

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:23.458
Hush!

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:26.750
-[dog barking]
-[Jean breathes heavily]

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.208
I'm making eggy bread.

01:05:31.416 --> 01:05:34.458
-And what have you done to your hair?
-Absolutely nothing.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.583
I have some Vitapointe
that can help with that.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.166
[coughs]

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.791
No, no, no. Not like that.

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:50.125
You're letting that nasty carp get it.

01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:52.833
There's some delicate goldfish in here.

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:53.833
Watch.

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.375
[Jean] Oh. [chuckles]

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:59.916
-[snickers] Damn.
-[Arun] Jeanie.

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.208
Jeanie?

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:04.250
Jean!

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:06.333
-[mom] Oh no you don't.
-Jean.

01:06:06.416 --> 01:06:07.333
Who's this?

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:10.291
Arun. I…

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:12.375
We were just leaving.

01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:16.166
This is my mother, Gladys May.
And, uh, Mum, this is Arun.

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:18.250
-We used to work in labs together.
-[Gladys] Hmm.

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:20.250
Which labs?

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.833
-He didn't work with me on that, Mum.
-Pleasure to meet you.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:24.791
-I've heard lots about you.
-[Gladys] Hmm.

01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:26.625
-Who's this?
-[Arun] Tabitha.

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:28.958
[Tabitha gurgling]

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.041
Tabitha.

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:33.833
That's a lovely name.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.291
[Arun] We call her Tabby Cat. [chuckles]

01:06:37.375 --> 01:06:39.083
Uh, don't judge us.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:44.000
-Let's hope she's not furry.
-[chuckles]

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.625
How's Bob?

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:53.208
On good form. Distracted.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.083
Full of the latest. It's… nice though,
to have him back full-time in Cambridge.

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.500
He's not going to Oldham anymore?

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:03.125
You didn't know?

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.083
They folded it,
what, three months after you left.

01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:07.916
Patrick agreed it was for the best.

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:12.208
Would've thought he'd have written to you,
but… that's Bob, I suppose.

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:15.375
[thoughtful piano music playing]

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:36.375
Thank you, God,
for this food and this family.

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:38.625
We remember those who have no food today,

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.541
and those who do have food
but no one to share it with. Amen.

[piano music continues]

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:06.166

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.250
[muffled chattering]

01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:12.875
[Jean] Hello. I'm after Bob.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.208
Oh, kitchen.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:15.958
[overlapping chattering nearby]

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:19.458
[Ruth] Jean! Hello.

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:20.375
Ruth.

01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:23.083
-Where's Bob?
-He's in there.

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:26.625
[girl] I want to fold it like a diamond,
so it comes out like a flower.

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:29.125
-No, Meg, that's not how we--
-[Meg] I know how to.

01:08:29.208 --> 01:08:30.041
Oh.

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:31.833
Can I talk to you?

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:33.250
[overlapping chatter]

01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:36.208
Yes. Girls, keep folding like I said.

01:08:36.291 --> 01:08:38.625
Match the sides,
push it down, in the envelope.

01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:40.625
Neat leaflets make all the difference.

01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:42.083
[girls wearily] Yes, Dad.

01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:45.375
-Are you running for Parliament?
-Ah, you see, this is the thing.

01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:48.166
I'd have expected it
to stretch to your side of town by now.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.916
You should've at least
got a bloody leaflet through your door.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.625
[Jean] My mind's been elsewhere.

01:08:53.833 --> 01:08:55.500
[Bob gently] Yes. Of course.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.666
I stand… no chance at all.

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:01.750
Well, some chance.

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:05.958
Cambridge does need a Labour MP,
and… winds do change.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.833
Don't make it my responsibility.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.208
-What?
-Kershaw's.

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:13.500
You stopped because of me.

01:09:16.416 --> 01:09:18.500
It… it wasn't working.

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.125
And so we…

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.083
I decided to move on.

01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.333
I decided to step away.

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:29.000
I've always been passionate
about politics, you know that.

01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:31.750
-The chance to represent at Parliament.
-You gave up.

01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:37.125
No. We left it for others to solve.
That's how science works, Jean.

01:09:37.208 --> 01:09:39.833
My mother is sick, and I love her.

01:09:40.791 --> 01:09:42.541
I had no choice.

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:45.083
Don't be ridiculous.

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.708
Of course you had a choice.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:50.583
[poignant music playing]

01:09:56.416 --> 01:09:58.000
[softly] We were so close.

01:10:02.958 --> 01:10:04.541
I didn't expect you to give up.

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:07.500
Yes, well,

01:10:08.916 --> 01:10:10.708
you gave up first, Jeanie.

01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:14.500
You.

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:19.166
[poignant music continues]

[hymn playing on radio]

01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:39.916
Are you thinking of going back to it
when we're done here?

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:43.625
There's nothing to go back to.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:48.958
I'm just going through some old notes,
trying to understand some things.

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.166
Promise me you won't go back to it, Jean.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:54.583
Settle down.

01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:57.333
Have children of your own.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.166
[coughs]

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:05.000
I can't do it, Mum.

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:10.375
I can't get pregnant.

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:11.791
Nonsense.

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:13.583
You haven't tried.

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:18.125
I've been having
unprotected sex since 1964.

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:21.958
You have a sinner under your roof.

01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:26.333
And you've been sleeping with these men…

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:29.375
because you want a baby?

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.708
And because I enjoy it.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.083
Is that right?

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:41.041
[Jean] There are others like me, Mum.

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:42.041
Everywhere.

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:45.708
I wanted to help them.

01:11:47.458 --> 01:11:49.125
You always had so much love.

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:06.166

Sh…

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:14.666
-[choking] God will find a way.
-Stop. Get a breath in first, Mum.

[labored breathing]

01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:23.708
-You have blood around your mouth.
-[breathing heavily] Have I? Oh.

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:26.875
Shall I take you to bed?

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.625
-Mm.
-[softly] Come on.

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:31.875
You know, it's strange,

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:35.125
when you're looking back on a life.

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.250
Mostly all you can see is failure.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:41.375
[tuts] You weren't a failure.

01:12:43.666 --> 01:12:45.375
All the things you should've done

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.750
and didn't.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:48.708

-Mum.
-[inhales sharply]

But… the one thing

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.000
that you can't see failure in…

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.541
is your children.

01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:05.375
Because

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.125
they're always beautiful.

[church organ playing]

01:14:23.875 --> 01:14:25.083
[man] Miss Jean.

01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:28.416
Thank you so much for coming.
She would have loved that you were here.

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:32.083
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:14:32.166 --> 01:14:33.708
-Patrick.
-I hope you don't mind.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.666
-Bob told me, and I did want to--
-Is… Bob here too?

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:40.250
No. He said you wouldn't want him here,
but you might want me.

01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:43.041
I wasn't sure,
but Matron Muriel talked me into it.

01:14:44.166 --> 01:14:45.708
Thank you both for coming.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.708
-[softly] Thank you.
-Good morning.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.166
-[Rev Paulson] Lovely to meet you.
-[man] Good afternoon, Reverend.

[children shouting, laughing]

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:02.458
[Jean] There you go.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.041
It's a strange funeral really.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:08.250
Most of them look at me
like I'm the devil.

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:15.166
They still hate me. They all do. Hmm.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:17.583
[quietly] They're so boring with it.

01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.458
My mother was many things.

01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:25.166
One thing she wasn't was boring,
yet she had so many boring friends.

01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:29.541
Then she was lucky
to have an interesting daughter.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:33.958
I can't talk about her.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:37.333
Then we can talk about other… things.

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:39.625
Or you could talk to someone else.
We won't be offend--

01:15:39.708 --> 01:15:41.708
-[Jean] We made a mistake.
-We should get back soon.

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:42.750
[Jean] The stimulation.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:45.500
We've been creating
false cycles for the women,

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.708
working against their natural rhythms.

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:50.708
If we eliminate that,
be sure of our chemicals, we might just--

01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:53.083
Perhaps this is best left for another day.

01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:54.833
That's an interesting idea.

01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:58.666
-[Patrick] It's perhaps worth a try.
-[Muriel] Patrick.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:01.375
I have one last effort in me,
Jean seems to have,

01:16:01.458 --> 01:16:03.208
and you're indefatigable, Muriel.

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.250
The only question is…

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:12.375
If we can use their cycle,
we'll keep it constant.

01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:17.083
What else are you doing?
The election didn't work out.

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:18.625
Did you vote for me?

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.875
The solutions you've devised
are incredible.

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:22.583
Your processes are world-beating.

01:16:22.666 --> 01:16:24.958
The surgery Patrick's able to do
is mind-blowing.

01:16:25.041 --> 01:16:28.833
-Maybe not so much hyperbole?
-But… we're meddling too much.

01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:32.166
We leave the women as much as we can
to grow the eggs on their own.

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:34.583
If we remove the hormones
that subvert their fertility

01:16:34.666 --> 01:16:37.458
and bring back the menstrual cycle
to some sort of normality,

01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:39.791
we'll eliminate so much
of the risk of failure.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.125
And of course I voted for you.

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:43.625
I would need to be able to harvest

01:16:43.708 --> 01:16:47.333
between 24 and 26 hours
after the start of the LH surge.

01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:49.083
That degree of precision without drugs--

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:53.041
It would require…
urine assays every three hours.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:55.291
-Every three hours?
-To detect the LH surge.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:59.583
Even then, if we get it right, we'll only
produce one single embryo per woman.

01:16:59.666 --> 01:17:01.333
[Bob] It would lower our chances.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.916
But… one good embryo
would be better than 15 bad ones.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.791
We'd watch the egg until it was fertilized
and implant it then.

01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:17.916
Split-second precision,
every step of the way.

01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:20.083

Right. I think that's everyone.

So… you'll have to be monitored every day.

You'll have to move to Oldham to do so.

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:53.458
You'll have to watch

01:29:19.916 --> 01:29:21.000
I can't imagine.

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.625
Forgive me. There's no need for you to…

01:29:27.625 --> 01:29:30.250
know all of that, but my point being

01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:33.250
that the bit I most dislike about this job

01:29:33.333 --> 01:29:37.041
is having to decide
who will get help and who will not.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.916
[poignant music playing]

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:43.000
Hundreds of letters,
I know you get them too,

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:47.416
where women beg for the opportunity
to be on our program.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:52.333
And you read through their notes,
and… y-you can feel it.

01:29:52.416 --> 01:29:55.041
You can feel their eyes
on the back of your head.

01:29:57.583 --> 01:29:59.833
And we see ourselves
as the great possibility.

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:02.916
We can make the infertile fertile.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.708
But there are still
so many women we won't…

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.500
we won't be able to help.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.625
And I can't help thinking that, for them,

01:30:14.458 --> 01:30:18.625
our existence…
is just another source of pain.

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:26.875
[inhales sharply]

01:30:27.916 --> 01:30:29.875
Women presume we can have children.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:32.166
We're told so.

01:30:35.833 --> 01:30:38.833
[voice breaks] There is a biological
and social expectation.

01:30:42.625 --> 01:30:45.416
Nothing can make
the pain of that absence worse.

01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:53.583
[softly] But we have
the possibility of making it better.

01:30:56.375 --> 01:30:57.250
And, yes,

01:30:57.916 --> 01:31:01.791
I say that as someone
for whom the lifeboat can't help.

01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:06.791
[telephone dial whirring]

01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:09.833
[line ringing]

01:31:10.958 --> 01:31:12.250
[music fades out]

01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:15.333
[ringing continues]

01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:20.541
Patrick. Will you please be available
to replace the embryo this evening?

01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:22.708
Four-cell.

01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:26.458
What kind of birthday dinner?

01:31:29.291 --> 01:31:31.333
That's the name of your wife, am I right?

01:31:33.791 --> 01:31:35.791
[defensively] Well,
do you know my wife's name?

01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:40.375
Well, then I should've clearly
paid more attention.

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.875
[woman] I hope you'll tell him
we missed dessert.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:47.625
I'm gonna tell him we missed dessert
and a notorious cheese plate.

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:48.541
[wife chuckles]

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
How you can work in a place like this.

01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:55.541
This is after we've spruced it up.
You should've seen it before.

01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:59.125
It was… appalling.
At least now we have glass in the windows.

01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:01.916
[distant chatter]

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.583
-I managed to scare up some biscuits.
-Ah.

01:32:16.458 --> 01:32:19.500
Good evening, Matron.
Hope we haven't disturbed your evening.

01:32:19.583 --> 01:32:21.083
[Muriel] Delighted to be here.

01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:22.916
-[suspenseful music plays]
-[Patrick] Mmm.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.458
-Are they chocolate biscuits?
-[wife gasps] What a treat.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:27.500
[cog clicks]

01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:30.333
Eight beautiful cells.

01:32:32.458 --> 01:32:35.458
-[Jean] Matron and I will prep Mrs. Brown.
-[Patrick] I'll prepare the theater.

01:32:35.541 --> 01:32:37.541
-[Bob chuckles]
-[footsteps receding]

01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:40.750
[cog clicking]

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:49.875
-[Patrick quietly] Cannula, 2.2 mm.
-[Muriel] Mm-hmm.

01:32:52.208 --> 01:32:54.750
[nurse] If you could just
pop yourself up on the table for us

01:32:54.833 --> 01:32:57.916
and place your legs in the stirrups,
that'd be great.

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:05.875
[Mrs. Brown sighs softly]

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.291
[Bob] "6748/1."

01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:32.208
"6748/1. Lesley Brown."

01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:36.083
[inhales deeply]

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:39.250
[exhales shakily]

01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:42.833
[equipment rattles]

01:33:55.375 --> 01:33:57.000
[footsteps approaching]

01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:11.375
[Patrick] Yes. Now will do.

01:34:30.041 --> 01:34:31.625
[suspenseful music continues]

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.125
[Bob] All gone.

01:35:06.541 --> 01:35:07.833
[over intercom] All gone.

01:35:20.291 --> 01:35:21.291
Are you okay?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.708
I think I feel pregnant.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.166
-Does that make me quite mad?
-[chuckles]

01:35:29.125 --> 01:35:30.625
Not mad, exactly.

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:31.958
[Lesley chuckles softly]

01:35:33.333 --> 01:35:34.333
[Patrick] Well done.

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:40.916
[music fades out]

01:35:43.458 --> 01:35:46.916
It's getting worse, the press.
They know we're close.

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:49.791
We have to protect Lesley.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:52.958
We've protected them all.

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:57.000
Do you know
what those women have been through?

01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:03.541
Newspapers will pay £5,000 for the names
and addresses of our patients.

01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:06.416
A further 5,000
should any of them become a story.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.750
[whistles]

01:36:07.833 --> 01:36:11.083
We could be rich.
I've all their names and addresses.

01:36:11.166 --> 01:36:15.000
I know they're just specimens in a jar
for you, but these are people's lives.

01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:22.083
[Bob] Rachel, Kathy, Gail, Trisha.

01:36:23.083 --> 01:36:26.958
Harriet, Jan, Gracie, Nicola, Julie, Viv.

01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:32.125
Polly, Marie, Violet, Sally, Lauren, Liz.

01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:34.125
Jo, Christina.

01:36:35.041 --> 01:36:36.750
-Mel.
-You know their names.

01:36:37.875 --> 01:36:39.166
Of the Ovum Club?

01:36:40.291 --> 01:36:41.125
Yes.

01:36:41.208 --> 01:36:44.000
-[poignant music playing]
-I'm a scientist, Jean.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.375
I fail every day in the hope
that I'll succeed once in 20 years.

01:36:50.375 --> 01:36:51.291
[sighs]

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:57.500
They stay a number because,
otherwise, they'd take me down with them.

01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:00.875
[music brightens]

01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:04.750
You're a strange man.

01:37:04.833 --> 01:37:05.916
[Bob chuckles softly]

01:37:07.666 --> 01:37:09.875
-Strangest I've ever met.
-[chuckles softly]

01:37:14.041 --> 01:37:17.666
[over PA] A porter to radiology
for patient transfer assistance.

01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.000
[music fades out]

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.083
Good morning.

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:21.291
[Lesley] Good mornin'.

01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:25.250
Good news.

01:37:25.333 --> 01:37:28.500
The fetal head is a diameter
of 9.6 centimeters.

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:31.833
The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio is 3.9:1.

01:37:31.916 --> 01:37:32.791
This is a scale

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:35.541
by which we measure the baby's capacity
to breathe well at birth.

01:37:35.625 --> 01:37:39.625
Normally 2:1, so 3.9:1…
is a very good figure.

01:37:39.708 --> 01:37:42.041
So you think that she's ready to come out?

01:37:42.125 --> 01:37:42.958
[Patrick] Yes.

01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:46.916
The toxemia you've been suffering
leaves a question mark for me,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.958
and I think we need to get your baby out
sooner rather than later,

01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:52.250
which means… a decision

01:37:53.125 --> 01:37:56.666
between inducing the birth
and performing a Caesarean section.

01:37:57.541 --> 01:38:00.583
Mr. Steptoe, we only understand
half of what you're sayin',

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:04.958
but, well, we… trust
whatever decision that you think right.

01:38:06.458 --> 01:38:08.291
[inhales] I think you feel, like me,

01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:11.458
that if we can do this without
a press audience, it might be easier.

01:38:11.541 --> 01:38:13.333
-[Lesley] Mm.
-Of course we do. [scoffs]

01:38:13.416 --> 01:38:14.750
[tense music playing]

01:38:14.833 --> 01:38:17.041
[Patrick] Have your normal visitors today.

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:18.250
Tell them nothing.

01:38:18.333 --> 01:38:20.333
At 9:00 p.m., you should go home, John.

01:38:20.416 --> 01:38:22.750
We'll find a way
of bringing you back secretly.

01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.250
[music brightens]

01:38:25.458 --> 01:38:27.541
[Patrick] At 11:00 p.m., we'll operate.

01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:31.166
-[reporters clamor]
-And by… midnight, you'll have your child.

01:38:32.208 --> 01:38:33.416
How does that sound?

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:38.708
-That sounds rather marvelous, sir.
-[chuckles softly]

01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:42.166
[reporter 1] Can you confirm
that it's Lesley Brown?

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:45.000
[reporter 2] Picture,
Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein?

01:38:45.083 --> 01:38:47.500
-It's Dr. Frankenstein!
-[reporter 3] This way, Miss Purdy.

01:38:47.583 --> 01:38:49.500
[reporter 4] This way, Dr. Edwards!
This way!

01:38:49.583 --> 01:38:52.541
-[clamoring continues]
-[reporter 5] Doctor! Dr. Edwards!

[tense music playing]

01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:01.833
-[Muriel] I'm ready, Mr. Steptoe.
-[Patrick] Thank you, Muriel.

[ventilator whooshing]

01:39:06.083 --> 01:39:08.541
[Patrick] I'll be making
a vertical incision.

[ventilator whooshing]

01:39:46.958 --> 01:39:52.458
[Patrick] I'm now going to incise
the lower segment of the uterus.

Right, suction.

01:44:35.208 --> 01:44:36.625
-No. No.
-[Bob] A few words.

01:44:37.125 --> 01:44:39.041
-No.
-Come on. Jean, a speech.

01:44:39.125 --> 01:44:41.583
-[Jean] No way.
-Oh, okay! I will make a speech.

01:44:41.666 --> 01:44:45.291
-[Muriel] Oh! Well, of course! [laughs]
-[man impersonates Tarzan's call]

01:44:45.375 --> 01:44:48.958
-Right. First, I would like to thank…
-No, you wouldn't. No, you won't.

01:44:49.041 --> 01:44:51.333
Stop, Patrick. Without all of you--

01:44:51.416 --> 01:44:53.208
-You'd be a member of Parliament.
-Yes!

01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:55.583
-Ha-ha. Very good, very good.
-[Muriel laughs loudly]

01:44:55.666 --> 01:44:56.666
Matron!

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:58.958
[chuckling] For three days,

01:44:59.791 --> 01:45:02.708
that little girl grew in our culture.

01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:06.875
She was replaced inside her mother
with incredible skill.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:11.166
She wriggled out of her membrane
and expanded beautifully.

01:45:12.666 --> 01:45:15.791
We have done something
truly extraordinary.

01:45:16.625 --> 01:45:19.291
We have done it because it was necessary.

01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:25.875
It has been a privilege… to work with you,

01:45:27.625 --> 01:45:30.000
to sacrifice with you,

01:45:31.375 --> 01:45:32.625
to make with you.

01:45:35.875 --> 01:45:37.125
Remember this moment.

01:45:38.583 --> 01:45:42.166
I know that I will never be part
of something so extraordinary again.

01:45:42.916 --> 01:45:44.750
Remember it, and…

01:45:46.458 --> 01:45:47.666
and treasure it.

01:45:52.375 --> 01:45:53.250
To you all.

01:45:54.333 --> 01:45:56.291
-To us all.
-[all] To us all.

01:45:56.375 --> 01:45:57.458
So what now?

01:45:58.208 --> 01:45:59.541
[Jean] We do it all again.

01:45:59.625 --> 01:46:00.916
[all laugh]

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.458
Oh, the Browns have asked if we'd like
to give the baby a middle name. I…

01:46:04.541 --> 01:46:07.625
-I was thinking "Joy."
-[Muriel] Oh, that's lovely!

01:46:07.708 --> 01:46:10.333
-[overlapping chatter]
-[moving music playing]

01:46:13.583 --> 01:46:14.666
A good choice?

01:46:16.416 --> 01:46:17.500
A great choice.

01:46:21.916 --> 01:46:23.166
[chuckles softly]

01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:24.291
[music fades out]

01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:27.250
[Bob] Dear Mr. Killion,

01:46:27.875 --> 01:46:30.541
I feel strongly
about the inclusion on the plaque

01:46:30.625 --> 01:46:33.416
of those who helped
with the conception of Louise Brown.

01:46:33.916 --> 01:46:36.833
I feel this especially about Jean Purdy,

01:46:36.916 --> 01:46:39.750
who travelled to Oldham with me
for the full ten years

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:42.625
and contributed as much as we did
to the project.

01:46:43.125 --> 01:46:46.416
I was the biologist,
Patrick, the obstetrician,

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.625
and Jean…

01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:50.666
well, you could describe Jean as…

01:46:51.291 --> 01:46:55.000
[sighs] Well, without her,
none of this would've been possible.

01:46:55.625 --> 01:46:58.333
She made the unbearable bearable.

01:46:59.416 --> 01:47:01.458
So, you see, it is quite simple.

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:04.666
