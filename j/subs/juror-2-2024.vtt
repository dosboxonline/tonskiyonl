[somber music playing]

00:52.818 --> 00:54.416
[music fades]

01:01.287 --> 01:03.524
Okay. You ready?

01:16.538 --> 01:18.133
- It's beautiful.
- [both chuckle]

01:18.269 --> 01:20.339
- Where'd you find this?
- [chuckles] It's cute, right?

01:20.474 --> 01:23.342
[chuckles] Aw, I love this!

01:23.478 --> 01:24.809
- So cute.
- [both chuckle]

01:26.479 --> 01:28.186
It's perfect! [chuckles]

01:32.253 --> 01:34.389
[chuckles softly]

01:34.525 --> 01:37.124
It would've been,
you know, a lot for me.

01:37.259 --> 01:39.098
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:41.394 --> 01:42.398
It's perfect.

01:43.263 --> 01:44.235
You're perfect.

01:47.238 --> 01:48.635
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:50.436 --> 01:52.469
[laughter nearby]

01:52.604 --> 01:54.406
Are they here already?

01:54.542 --> 01:55.947
They're like 30 minutes early.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.549
- Why are they-- What?
- Hey.

01:57.684 --> 01:58.480
It's okay.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.552
- [chuckles]
- I love it.

02:05.185 --> 02:06.453
Yeah?

02:06.589 --> 02:08.150
I'll be honest.
Ally and I, you know,

02:08.286 --> 02:10.625
we weren't sure about
whether to have this party,

02:10.760 --> 02:13.130
but together there's nothing
we can't overcome.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.833
You're the strongest
woman I know.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.833
I love you more than anything.

02:16.969 --> 02:18.268
And I'm so damn excited

02:18.403 --> 02:19.829
to keep building
our lives together.

02:19.964 --> 02:21.969
- Me too. I love you.
- Love you.

02:22.104 --> 02:24.309
[all] Aw.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.035
Why don't you ever say
anything like that about me?

02:26.170 --> 02:28.378
Thank you all for being here.
Thank you.

02:31.578 --> 02:32.508
Vitamins are on the table.

02:32.644 --> 02:34.186
Oh. Thank you, baby.

02:35.952 --> 02:37.648
[sighs]

02:37.783 --> 02:39.485
- It was a nice party.
- Yeah.

02:39.620 --> 02:40.583
Think everyone had a good time.

02:40.718 --> 02:42.458
Yeah. You deserve it.

02:44.123 --> 02:47.030
You're just buttering me up
before you abandon me.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.497
I wish I could delay it again.

02:49.632 --> 02:51.098
- I know.
- I don't want to
leave you here.

02:51.234 --> 02:52.765
You just go to the judge

02:52.900 --> 02:54.630
and tell him something
wildly inappropriate

02:54.766 --> 02:56.269
and then come back to me.

02:56.405 --> 02:58.036
- I will.
- Oh, you will?

02:58.172 --> 02:59.537
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah. I got some--
- Oh, you will? Like what?

02:59.673 --> 03:01.303
- I'll say... [chuckles]
- What?

03:01.438 --> 03:03.176
I'll say we're having
a big old orgy tomorrow night

03:03.312 --> 03:04.310
and they're all invited.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.677
- [laughs]
- Ow!

03:05.813 --> 03:06.975
Ooh. No, no, no.
Be careful. Careful.

03:07.110 --> 03:08.686
All right.
That got me too excited.

03:08.821 --> 03:10.145
[both laugh]

03:11.054 --> 03:12.114
All right.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.718
Hey.

03:14.854 --> 03:16.052
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

03:25.765 --> 03:28.705
[man on radio]
<i>Just a reminder to send in
those mail-in ballots soon.</i>

03:28.840 --> 03:31.041
<i>We're only two weeks out
from election date, folks,</i>

03:31.177 --> 03:32.840
<i>and every ballot matters.</i>

03:32.975 --> 03:34.570
<i>So be sure to get yours in
before it's too late.</i>

03:34.705 --> 03:35.841
[turns off radio]

03:39.615 --> 03:40.978
[woman on phone]
<i>Faith, come on.</i>

03:41.113 --> 03:42.683
<i>Polling has you
at a 46-point deadlock,</i>

03:42.818 --> 03:44.787
<i>with 8% of voters
still undecided.</i>

03:44.922 --> 03:46.891
<i>We need to push your plan
to reduce the crime rate</i>

03:47.027 --> 03:48.025
<i>in order to pull ahead.</i>

03:48.161 --> 03:49.685
But this case is my campaign.

03:49.821 --> 03:51.019
He's a dangerous criminal

03:51.155 --> 03:52.591
with a long history
of violence.

03:52.726 --> 03:54.422
I put James Sythe away, we win.

03:54.558 --> 03:55.892
[sighs] <i>If you lose, you lose
your shot at being DA.</i>

03:56.028 --> 03:57.335
- All right. I got to go.
<i>- Faith--</i>

03:58.034 --> 03:59.271
[sighs]

04:08.173 --> 04:09.776
- Oh. There she is.
- [cameras clicking]

04:12.214 --> 04:13.718
Hey. Excuse me!

04:13.853 --> 04:15.116
You, uh...

04:15.251 --> 04:16.211
You dropped this.

04:16.922 --> 04:18.323
Oh. I did.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.885
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.253
- No worries. Have a good day.
- [chuckles]

04:21.389 --> 04:22.591
Yeah. You too.

04:26.257 --> 04:28.190
- Through that door.
- [woman] Oh, thank you.

04:29.765 --> 04:31.461
Where do I go
for, uh, jury duty?

04:31.597 --> 04:32.601
Go down there.

04:34.939 --> 04:35.934
Thanks.

04:51.049 --> 04:53.450
[bailiff] All right, guys.
Eyes up.

04:53.586 --> 04:54.656
Pay attention.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.254
[narrator on TV] <i>Hello.
I'd like to welcome you</i>

04:58.389 --> 05:00.796
<i>as a juror in the Georgia
court system.</i>

05:00.932 --> 05:03.935
<i>As a juror, you protect
the right of every person</i>

05:04.071 --> 05:05.532
<i>to a trial by jury.</i>

05:05.667 --> 05:07.229
<i>The right to a trial by jury</i>

05:07.364 --> 05:09.908
<i>is a cornerstone
of our democracy.</i>

05:10.044 --> 05:11.441
<i>That right is protected</i>

05:11.577 --> 05:13.444
<i>by the United States
constitution.</i>

05:16.007 --> 05:17.048
- [man] There she is.
- [sighs]

05:17.184 --> 05:18.641
Sugar-free vanilla with skim.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.309
[Faith] Ah. You're good.

05:20.444 --> 05:21.348
- Can I get you something else?
- [Faith] Mmm-mmm.

05:21.484 --> 05:22.782
You got something for me?

05:22.917 --> 05:24.783
[sighs] Okay.
Voluntary manslaughter

05:24.919 --> 05:26.458
with a recommendation
of 20 years.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.059
Fifteen to serve,
followed by five on probation.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.592
Wow. That's a hell of a deal.

05:29.727 --> 05:31.561
I will even waive
the recidivist statute

05:31.696 --> 05:33.155
if he pleads before
we strike the jury.

05:33.290 --> 05:34.793
And admit to something
he didn't do?

05:34.929 --> 05:37.600
[chuckles] Save it
for the jury.

05:37.736 --> 05:40.238
Better yet, why don't you
plead your guy out

05:40.374 --> 05:42.741
and say, free
for your caseload.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.870
Look... [sighs]

05:45.309 --> 05:46.908
my client wants a trial.

05:47.043 --> 05:50.177
Well, then, you're wasting
my time and your client's.

05:50.312 --> 05:51.306
Last chance.

05:53.315 --> 05:54.386
After you.

06:02.124 --> 06:06.189
The case you're about to hear
is an alleged homicide.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.867
The state is charging
James Michael Sythe

06:09.002 --> 06:10.367
with malice murder

06:10.503 --> 06:13.537
for the death
of Kendall Alice Carter.

06:13.672 --> 06:16.341
Now, if any of you have
a personal relationship

06:16.477 --> 06:18.510
with the accused,
and/or the deceased

06:18.645 --> 06:20.979
that will prohibit you
from serving on this panel

06:21.114 --> 06:22.914
in an unbiased manner,

06:23.049 --> 06:24.306
please speak now.

06:32.716 --> 06:33.689
Yes.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.994
[exhales]

06:37.130 --> 06:38.353
He used to ride my bus.

06:39.989 --> 06:41.158
And when was this?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.295
[sighs] I don't know.
Few years ago.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.933
Okay. Then there's no reason
we can't leave it there.

06:49.069 --> 06:51.438
I think you'll make
a fine juror.

06:51.573 --> 06:53.610
Does anyone else think

06:53.746 --> 06:56.976
that they're incapable
of serving on this panel?

06:58.247 --> 06:59.341
Yes.

07:01.184 --> 07:02.686
Uh...

07:02.821 --> 07:04.352
Your Honor, my wife
is in the third trimester

07:04.488 --> 07:06.114
of a high-risk pregnancy.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.587
I'd like to be
available to her.

07:08.723 --> 07:10.251
Well, that's commendable.

07:10.387 --> 07:12.354
What hours
do you normally work?

07:13.431 --> 07:15.366
Uh, 9:00 to 6:00, typically.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.129
Then you have my word
that this court

07:17.264 --> 07:20.901
will not demand one minute more
of your time than that.

07:22.601 --> 07:23.475
Yeah.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.078
See, the fact that
you don't want to be here

07:27.214 --> 07:28.744
is exactly what makes you

07:28.879 --> 07:31.879
the perfect group
to judicate this case.

07:33.218 --> 07:34.884
You are impartial.

07:35.020 --> 07:38.083
You have no skin in the game.
Nothing to gain or lose.

07:38.219 --> 07:40.651
And that is why I believe
that this process,

07:40.787 --> 07:43.594
as flawed as it may be,

07:43.729 --> 07:46.465
is still our best chance
at finding justice.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.600
Do you work, Mrs. Aldworth?

07:51.736 --> 07:53.497
Well, I had the toughest
job there is.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.670
I raised two kids
and just sent them off
to college.

07:55.806 --> 07:57.475
- Ah. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.211
And have you ever served
on a jury before?

08:00.346 --> 08:02.673
Twice. Both were mistrials.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.682
Twice. Okay. Okay.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.647
Mr. King. Have you ever had
a physical altercation

08:08.783 --> 08:10.647
with a significant other?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.415
Are you gonna ask that question
to every guy in this courtroom?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.924
If I have to, I will. I...

08:17.060 --> 08:19.964
I know these questions
can be very personal--

08:20.099 --> 08:21.093
Nah, man.

08:21.926 --> 08:22.897
That ain't me.

08:25.962 --> 08:27.165
Thank you, sir.

08:29.305 --> 08:31.569
[Faith] How long have you lived
in the area, Mr. Chicowski?

08:31.704 --> 08:33.274
About ten years.

08:33.410 --> 08:34.706
And you, uh...

08:34.842 --> 08:36.003
Oh, you run a flower shop?

08:36.139 --> 08:38.176
Yeah. With my wife.

08:38.311 --> 08:40.275
Mr. Robinson, it says here
your wife has

08:40.410 --> 08:42.646
primary custody
of your daughter.

08:42.781 --> 08:43.753
Is that correct?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.791
Yeah.

08:48.927 --> 08:51.024
Do you mind if I ask you
who ended the marriage?

08:52.966 --> 08:53.862
She did.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.034
Thank you. All you.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.768
Mr. Kemp.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.634
And you're a magazine writer?

09:01.770 --> 09:03.035
[Justin] Uh, that's right.

09:03.170 --> 09:04.405
What kind of articles
do you write?

09:04.540 --> 09:06.005
Features, mostly.

09:06.141 --> 09:07.603
So you write
about a variety of topics?

09:07.739 --> 09:09.007
Yes.

09:09.143 --> 09:11.816
Ever written
about a murder trial?

09:11.951 --> 09:15.179
Uh, well, I write for
a regional lifestyle magazine

09:15.314 --> 09:17.187
so it's not exactly
<i>Vanity Fair.</i>

09:17.322 --> 09:18.848
[jurors chuckling]

09:18.983 --> 09:20.525
Take that as a no.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.790
Being a writer,
I imagine you read a lot.

09:22.926 --> 09:24.894
You've read anything
about this case?

09:25.029 --> 09:27.060
No. No. Today's the first
I've heard about it.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.733
Well, then, I think you'll make

09:29.868 --> 09:32.869
a perfectly acceptable
member of this jury.

09:33.004 --> 09:35.706
All right. Does the defense
accept or challenge?

09:37.168 --> 09:39.942
We accept him, Your Honor.

09:40.078 --> 09:44.539
Good. Please enter Justin Kemp
as juror number two.

09:47.344 --> 09:48.718
- [Justin] Hey.
- [Ally] Hi!

09:48.853 --> 09:50.552
- [Justin] Hi.
- [Ally] How did it go?

09:50.687 --> 09:51.915
- [sighs]
- [Ally] No.

09:52.051 --> 09:53.588
- I got picked.
- No.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.057
- Mmm.
- I'm so sorry.

09:55.193 --> 09:56.551
I know.

09:56.686 --> 09:57.858
What happened
to "wildly inappropriate"?

09:57.993 --> 09:58.854
Ah. Well,
I'm saving that for you.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.828
Oh, yeah?

10:00.963 --> 10:03.160
They said
it'll be a short trial.

10:03.296 --> 10:04.533
I feel like
they always say that,

10:04.668 --> 10:06.099
- but I hope so.
- I know.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.099
How was your day?

10:08.235 --> 10:10.465
It was okay.
I did this. [laughs]

10:10.601 --> 10:12.576
Yeah? It's good progress.
Looks good.

10:12.711 --> 10:14.544
- [laughs] Thank you.
- All day?

10:14.679 --> 10:16.008
No, this did not
take me all day.

10:16.143 --> 10:17.913
- Yeah.
- I watched a documentary...

10:18.048 --> 10:21.378
- Mmm-hmm. What about?
- ...and I peed 94 times.

10:21.513 --> 10:23.982
- Ninety-four? Okay.
- And I ate some ice.

10:24.118 --> 10:25.247
- Ooh.
- Can I have some more?

10:25.383 --> 10:26.356
- You need some more? Ice?
- Yeah.

10:26.492 --> 10:27.890
Ice. Coming up. All right.

10:30.955 --> 10:32.521
[exhales]

10:41.403 --> 10:44.474
The people need to know
how I'll make this city safer.

10:44.609 --> 10:46.467
And women need to know that,

10:46.603 --> 10:48.270
if they're in
an abusive relationship,

10:48.405 --> 10:49.809
their community has their back.

10:49.944 --> 10:52.083
The rest? The rest is noise.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.410
So, thank you.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.152
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for coming.

11:00.318 --> 11:01.592
Thank you. Thank you so much.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.188
Thank you. Hey!
Thank you so much.

11:04.323 --> 11:05.691
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

11:05.827 --> 11:07.160
Thank you so much. Yeah.

11:08.797 --> 11:10.130
[man] Hey. Good job.

11:14.331 --> 11:16.598
- [sighs] Hey.
- Hey.

11:17.441 --> 11:18.406
Nice speech.

11:18.541 --> 11:20.041
[chuckles]

11:22.148 --> 11:23.337
Thanks.

11:23.473 --> 11:25.482
"Justice is truth in action"?

11:25.617 --> 11:27.715
Mmm-hmm. Professor Nielsen.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.853
Yeah. No. Yeah, I remember.

11:31.314 --> 11:32.449
You still believe it?

11:34.392 --> 11:35.551
Of course.

11:36.994 --> 11:38.387
All right.
As long as it doesn't

11:38.523 --> 11:40.461
get in the way of a win,
though, right?

11:40.597 --> 11:42.927
Oh, my God.
If you got something to say,
Eric, just say it.

11:43.062 --> 11:45.727
Mmm. I'm saying, he...

11:45.863 --> 11:48.069
You know, he loves you.
You were his favorite student.

11:48.669 --> 11:49.671
[scoffs]

11:49.806 --> 11:51.202
Are you really going there?

11:51.338 --> 11:53.673
- Yeah, I'm going there.
- Oh, my God!

11:53.809 --> 11:55.307
And now you're a...

11:57.216 --> 11:58.211
What?

11:58.878 --> 12:00.285
I'm a what?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.984
A politician. [sighs]

12:06.251 --> 12:07.515
[Judge Thelma] Good morning.

12:07.651 --> 12:09.391
We will begin
with opening statements.

12:09.527 --> 12:10.762
Ms. Killebrew.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.397
Okay. The facts
of the case are these.

12:16.532 --> 12:19.934
One year ago, on October 25th,
the defendant, James Sythe,

12:20.070 --> 12:22.464
and his then-girlfriend,
Kendall Carter,

12:22.600 --> 12:24.099
went drinking
at Rowdy's Hideaway

12:24.235 --> 12:25.337
on Old Quarry Road.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.914
[country rock music
playing on speakers]

12:33.977 --> 12:35.787
Come on. I walked all the way
up there and got it.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.646
- Take the drink.
- I'm already drunk, babe.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.121
[chuckles]

12:46.532 --> 12:48.030
[inaudible conversation]

12:54.066 --> 12:55.867
Things got tense.

12:56.002 --> 12:57.269
They had a fight.

12:57.404 --> 12:58.443
[Kendall] Not fair
what you're doing.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.942
[James] Hey, leave it alone.

13:00.078 --> 13:01.838
[Kendall] What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:01.974 --> 13:03.039
[James] I've already told you.
We're not moving in together.

13:03.175 --> 13:04.474
[Kendall] I'm not...

13:04.610 --> 13:06.048
- What is wrong with it?
- Stop pushing me.

13:06.183 --> 13:07.311
- I told you, stop...
- I'm not pushing you.

13:07.446 --> 13:08.118
- [gasps]
- I said stop pushing!

13:08.254 --> 13:09.513
[scoffs]

13:13.250 --> 13:14.825
Jesus Christ.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.625
[Faith] <i>She stormed
out of the bar</i>

13:16.761 --> 13:18.159
<i>and he followed her.</i>

13:20.731 --> 13:22.063
The fight escalated,

13:22.199 --> 13:24.132
and things quickly
got out of control.

13:25.832 --> 13:27.505
Hey.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.971
What the hell are you doing?

13:29.107 --> 13:30.868
- What are you doing?
- Get away from me.

13:31.003 --> 13:32.270
Don't touch me.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.109
- How dare you?
- Are you kidding me?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.916
[Eric] It was par
for the course.

13:43.052 --> 13:44.754
They'd argue. They'd break up.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.349
And they'd make up the next day

13:46.485 --> 13:47.886
after they both
had calmed down.

13:48.022 --> 13:51.086
It was basically a game.

13:51.221 --> 13:54.224
[Faith] Now, this couple
had a history of violent
interactions,

13:54.360 --> 13:57.325
but this time she was serious.

13:57.460 --> 13:58.935
She was done with him.

13:59.071 --> 14:02.533
So she left and headed
down the road, on foot.

14:07.239 --> 14:09.540
[tense music playing]

14:16.012 --> 14:19.551
[Eric] So this was just
another typical night of drama.

14:19.686 --> 14:23.158
So James Sythe got in his car
and he drove home.

14:25.192 --> 14:27.855
He flew into a violent rage

14:27.991 --> 14:31.067
and followed Kendall Carter
down the road...

14:32.629 --> 14:34.565
where he proceeded to kill her.

14:40.305 --> 14:41.913
[cell phone chimes]

14:42.979 --> 14:44.111
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

14:44.246 --> 14:46.742
- [gasping]
- [tires screeching]

14:49.512 --> 14:50.889
[breathing heavily]

14:54.794 --> 14:57.457
[Faith] He beat her viciously.

14:57.593 --> 15:00.195
He pushed her over a railing
to the creek below...

15:01.799 --> 15:03.099
and left her to die.

15:03.799 --> 15:05.266
[jurors exclaim]

15:41.903 --> 15:43.799
[panting]

15:50.641 --> 15:52.574
James Sythe didn't attack her

15:52.709 --> 15:54.408
and he couldn't have pushed her

15:54.544 --> 15:56.779
because he wasn't there.

15:59.923 --> 16:02.283
[somber music playing]

16:02.419 --> 16:04.127
James Sythe...

16:05.695 --> 16:06.696
[sighs]

16:06.831 --> 16:07.999
took an innocent life.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.128
James Sythe...

16:11.264 --> 16:12.465
is an innocent man.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.701
Thank you.

16:24.748 --> 16:26.941
[retching]

16:30.248 --> 16:31.312
[flushes]

16:31.447 --> 16:32.991
[sighing]

16:43.294 --> 16:45.199
Damn, man.

16:45.335 --> 16:47.005
- You... You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:48.372 --> 16:50.635
Yeah. Just those
crime scene pictures.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.967
Never had a strong stomach.

16:53.941 --> 16:55.573
Yeah.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.312
All right.
Well, you have a good night.

16:57.946 --> 16:58.940
You, too.

17:13.229 --> 17:14.659
[all] God grant me the serenity

17:14.794 --> 17:17.398
to accept the things
that I cannot change,

17:17.534 --> 17:20.201
the courage to change
the things that I can,

17:20.336 --> 17:22.733
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

17:24.139 --> 17:25.235
Great work, everybody.

17:25.370 --> 17:26.744
Keep coming back.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.844
[all] It works if you work it.

17:28.979 --> 17:30.180
Great job, everybody.

17:31.344 --> 17:32.347
[man] Right on, bro!

17:35.181 --> 17:36.551
Hey, Justin.

17:36.687 --> 17:37.720
Hey!

17:37.856 --> 17:39.153
You were quiet tonight.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.385
Yeah. I've got
a lot on my mind.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.056
Yeah, I can tell. [chuckles]

17:43.192 --> 17:45.790
You want to talk about it?

17:45.925 --> 17:49.061
Okay, look, whatever it is,
my advice is the same.

17:49.197 --> 17:51.067
You know what to do.

17:51.202 --> 17:52.895
We're only as sick
as our secrets.

17:53.902 --> 17:54.937
Yeah.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.239
Okay, I'm always here for you.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.123
[tense music playing]

18:44.450 --> 18:45.953
[man] Working late?

18:46.088 --> 18:47.122
[keyboard clacks]

18:47.257 --> 18:48.654
Be out of your way in a minute.

18:48.789 --> 18:49.919
Nah, take as long as you want,
I'll come back.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:17.914 --> 19:20.317
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

19:20.453 --> 19:21.515
How was the meeting?

19:21.650 --> 19:23.084
It was good.

19:23.219 --> 19:25.091
I stayed after
to talk with Larry for a bit.

19:25.227 --> 19:26.456
[breathing heavily]

19:26.591 --> 19:27.997
You okay? Your heart.

19:28.132 --> 19:30.333
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.698
Yeah, I'm good.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.635
Everything's going to be fine.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.104
We're going
to be a family soon.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.768
[Justin] Hmm.

19:40.904 --> 19:43.005
Very soon, I hope. [chuckles]

19:43.815 --> 19:46.250
[sighing]

19:52.620 --> 19:55.352
- [tires screeching]
- [gasping]

19:55.488 --> 19:56.517
[breathing heavily]

19:56.652 --> 19:57.624
What the...

20:11.102 --> 20:13.473
I'd seen them in there before.
A couple times.

20:13.608 --> 20:16.072
Um, it was always
the same thing.

20:16.207 --> 20:19.173
They would start off
fun and flirty, and then,

20:19.308 --> 20:21.718
after a few drinks,
things would change.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.479
Change, how?

20:23.615 --> 20:25.818
That night, she came in,

20:25.953 --> 20:29.859
trying to talk to him,
like, seriously, you know?

20:29.995 --> 20:32.855
But he wasn't having it.

20:32.991 --> 20:34.197
[Kendall]
What's wrong with you?

20:34.333 --> 20:35.695
What, do you want me
to disagree?

20:35.830 --> 20:37.301
No. I want you to say,
"I love you, too."

20:38.199 --> 20:39.500
I basically did.

20:39.635 --> 20:40.664
I want you to say,
"I love you, too."

20:40.799 --> 20:42.101
Read between the goddamn lines,

20:42.236 --> 20:43.869
I said, "Yeah."

20:44.004 --> 20:45.408
- [Kendall] What lines?
- [James] I'm sick of this shit.

20:45.543 --> 20:46.737
[Kendall] What lines
are you talking about?

20:46.873 --> 20:47.535
[James] Hey,
get out of my face!

20:47.670 --> 20:49.038
[Kendall gasps]

20:49.173 --> 20:52.607
[woman] <i>He got mad.
Like, scary.</i>

20:52.742 --> 20:54.142
<i>She leaves.</i>

20:56.379 --> 20:59.556
<i>He follows her outside.
So I started following.</i>

20:59.692 --> 21:00.687
Hey!

21:01.753 --> 21:03.156
What the hell are you doing?

21:03.292 --> 21:04.586
What are you doing?

21:04.721 --> 21:05.725
I want to go home.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.762
- I don't want
to do this anymore.
- [James] Do what?

21:09.897 --> 21:11.892
[Kendall] I'm done.
You're embarrassing!

21:12.027 --> 21:13.203
What are you talking about?

21:13.338 --> 21:14.536
Who cares
what these idiots think?

21:16.836 --> 21:18.670
What are you going to do?
Hit me?

21:18.805 --> 21:20.101
- Relax. I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

21:20.236 --> 21:21.475
- It was...
- What are you going to do?

21:21.611 --> 21:23.439
- How dare you?
- Are you kidding me?

21:23.574 --> 21:24.579
Bring it on!

21:26.947 --> 21:28.781
You better get the fuck
out of here right now.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.719
[crowd murmuring]

21:31.854 --> 21:35.491
Fine, walk home, in the rain,
you stupid bitch!

21:38.894 --> 21:41.123
- And, Kendall, we ain't over!
- I'm done, James.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.094
[crowd murmuring]

21:50.337 --> 21:52.205
So she left,

21:52.341 --> 21:53.837
then what happened?

21:53.973 --> 21:55.946
He followed her
out of the parking lot

21:56.082 --> 21:58.074
and onto Old Quarry Road.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.912
Thank you. No further
questions, Your Honor.

22:02.619 --> 22:05.147
So you saw him walk down
Old Quarry Road?

22:05.758 --> 22:07.488
Yes.

22:07.624 --> 22:08.958
Did you know
that his car was parked

22:09.094 --> 22:10.119
down on Old Quarry Road?

22:11.489 --> 22:12.528
No.

22:13.557 --> 22:15.131
No.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.791
Were you drinking that night?

22:16.926 --> 22:18.127
Objection, Your Honor.

22:18.761 --> 22:20.400
Overruled.

22:20.536 --> 22:22.032
Were you drinking that night?

22:23.105 --> 22:24.407
Yes.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.308
So you don't know
how far he followed her

22:27.444 --> 22:30.805
down Old Quarry Road, do you?

22:30.940 --> 22:32.515
No. Um, at that point,

22:32.650 --> 22:34.946
I had stopped filming
and I went back inside.

22:36.285 --> 22:38.347
No more questions.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.915
[Judge Thelma] Does the State
have any more questions?

22:41.051 --> 22:42.525
No more questions, Your Honor.

22:46.797 --> 22:49.132
[Judge Thelma] Thank you.
You may step down.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.699
I was at the bar till close.

22:51.834 --> 22:54.535
I didn't see either one of them
come back in.

22:54.671 --> 22:55.897
And then the next day,
I opened,

22:56.032 --> 22:57.408
and I did what I always do.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.905
I took the night's trash
out to the dumpster.

23:03.472 --> 23:06.483
Miss! Miss!
I'm sorry. I need your help.

23:06.618 --> 23:09.519
Because of the rain
the night before...

23:09.654 --> 23:11.851
<i>the trails were
all muddy and wet.</i>

23:15.058 --> 23:16.988
<i>So I had to cut up
to Old Quarry by the bridge</i>

23:17.123 --> 23:18.726
<i>in order to get back
to the road.</i>

23:19.956 --> 23:21.597
[tense music playing]

23:22.992 --> 23:24.864
[breathing heavily]

23:36.875 --> 23:38.148
Right. And just to be clear,

23:38.284 --> 23:40.143
when you found Kendall Carter,

23:40.943 --> 23:42.211
she was dead?

23:44.523 --> 23:47.249
Her head was
in a pool of blood.

23:48.489 --> 23:49.592
It was awful.

23:52.763 --> 23:54.295
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Reed.

23:54.430 --> 23:55.598
I know it isn't easy.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.095
That's all I have.

24:00.404 --> 24:02.099
Mr. Resnick, your witness.

24:03.404 --> 24:05.204
Mr. Reed,

24:05.340 --> 24:08.039
you hike those trails
in the woods frequently,
don't you?

24:09.278 --> 24:10.344
Yes, sir.

24:10.479 --> 24:12.177
Twice a week at least.

24:12.313 --> 24:14.848
In your opinion, is the hike
down the hillside difficult?

24:15.613 --> 24:17.418
Yes.

24:17.554 --> 24:19.323
I assume you wear hiking boots

24:19.459 --> 24:21.052
when you hike, Mr. Reed?
Is that correct?

24:23.028 --> 24:24.318
Of course.

24:24.453 --> 24:27.531
This is a picture
of Kendall Carter

24:27.667 --> 24:31.363
the morning you found her
below Old Quarry Road.

24:31.498 --> 24:33.933
Can you please tell us
what kind of shoes
she's wearing?

24:37.065 --> 24:38.135
Looks like heels.

24:40.077 --> 24:42.174
Heels.

24:42.310 --> 24:45.010
And if she's walking along
the edge of Old Quarry Road

24:45.145 --> 24:49.617
in a blinding rainstorm
at night, in heels,

24:49.753 --> 24:52.848
and she suddenly
lost her footing,

24:52.984 --> 24:54.781
it'd be next to impossible

24:54.917 --> 24:56.791
to prevent herself
from falling,
isn't that correct?

24:59.690 --> 25:00.630
Yes.

25:03.761 --> 25:04.700
Thank you.

25:06.670 --> 25:09.003
She landed
in a posterior position,

25:09.138 --> 25:12.840
which suggests she was pushed,
as opposed to a fall.

25:12.975 --> 25:15.211
Rigor mortis indicated
the victim had been dead

25:15.346 --> 25:16.914
for around nine hours.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.246
[Faith] Hmm.

25:18.382 --> 25:19.781
And the cause of death?

25:19.916 --> 25:22.049
The severity of her
skull fractures suggests

25:22.185 --> 25:25.281
she was struck
with a non-specific
blunt instrument.

25:26.687 --> 25:28.658
And the manner of death?

25:29.820 --> 25:30.825
Homicide.

25:33.126 --> 25:34.994
[Faith] Thank you.
No more questions.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.965
The witness is yours,
Mr. Resnick.

25:41.101 --> 25:43.034
Is it possible
that she sustained

25:43.170 --> 25:45.206
her head injuries
from hitting the rocks?

25:45.341 --> 25:47.041
Possible, sure,

25:47.177 --> 25:48.341
but in my
professional opinion,
it's not likely.

25:48.477 --> 25:49.943
But possible.

25:53.043 --> 25:54.013
That's all from me.

25:59.187 --> 26:01.790
Thank you for your testimony.
You may step down.

26:06.157 --> 26:07.693
On October 25th of last year,

26:07.829 --> 26:09.199
you lived on Old Quarry Road.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.266
- Correct?
- Yes.

26:11.401 --> 26:13.067
And do you remember
anything unusual happening
that evening?

26:13.202 --> 26:16.396
I saw a man get out of his car
[chuckles] in a storm.

26:16.532 --> 26:17.802
Do you remember
what time that was?

26:17.937 --> 26:20.072
It was 11:48 on the button.

26:20.939 --> 26:22.074
I looked at the clock.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.607
I heard thunder,

26:24.742 --> 26:27.079
and so I went to the window,
and lightning lit up the sky.

26:28.550 --> 26:29.483
<i>There he was.</i>

26:29.619 --> 26:31.216
[Faith] What was he doing?

26:31.352 --> 26:34.548
He looked around, he went over
to the side of the road.

26:37.088 --> 26:39.562
Peered over the railing...

26:39.697 --> 26:43.434
got back in his car
and drove off.

26:43.569 --> 26:44.965
And is that man
you saw that night

26:45.100 --> 26:46.467
here in the courtroom
today, do you know?

26:46.602 --> 26:47.671
Can you point him out?

26:49.933 --> 26:50.938
[coin clatters]

26:52.905 --> 26:54.139
Yes, he is here today.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.310
That's him right there.

26:58.446 --> 27:00.582
Let the record reflect that
the witness has identified

27:00.718 --> 27:02.746
the man he saw
as the defendant,

27:02.882 --> 27:05.619
James Michael Sythe.

27:05.755 --> 27:07.086
No more questions, Your Honor.

27:09.025 --> 27:11.228
All right. This feels
like a good time

27:11.363 --> 27:13.424
to break for the day.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.656
This court is in recess until
9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning

27:16.792 --> 27:19.527
when we will pick up here
where we left off.

27:31.779 --> 27:32.815
Justin, what's going on?

27:34.945 --> 27:36.049
I need a lawyer.

27:38.016 --> 27:40.287
Okay. Give me a dollar.

27:40.423 --> 27:42.455
And I'm not joking, that gives
us attorney-client privilege.

27:42.590 --> 27:43.584
Take a seat.

27:46.894 --> 27:48.730
So I went to clear my head,

27:48.866 --> 27:51.229
and found myself
at Rowdy's Hideaway...

27:52.937 --> 27:54.699
Ordered a drink
and sat there for a while,

27:54.835 --> 27:56.331
then I got up and left.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.332
I got to the car.
It was raining.

27:59.468 --> 28:00.940
I turned back onto Old Quarry,

28:01.076 --> 28:03.004
I went about
a quarter of a mile

28:03.140 --> 28:04.473
and I hit something.

28:06.049 --> 28:07.243
I got out of the car
and I looked around.

28:07.379 --> 28:08.752
I checked,
I didn't see anything,

28:08.887 --> 28:11.283
and I figured it was
a deer that ran off,

28:11.418 --> 28:14.186
and then I got back
in the car and went home.

28:17.419 --> 28:19.594
Okay, what's the problem?

28:19.729 --> 28:21.764
I got called for jury duty.

28:21.899 --> 28:24.326
- The Kendall Carter case?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:24.462 --> 28:27.795
And they found her body
in a creek bed,

28:27.931 --> 28:30.664
about a quarter mile from
Rowdy's Hideaway last October.

28:33.709 --> 28:34.910
What are you telling me?

28:35.908 --> 28:37.341
[breathes heavily]

28:38.374 --> 28:39.673
Maybe I didn't hit a deer.

28:41.252 --> 28:42.247
[sighs]

28:43.679 --> 28:45.217
[stammers] I don't know
what to do.

28:47.288 --> 28:48.656
You were at a bar
and you had a drink?

28:48.791 --> 28:50.226
Yes, but I didn't touch it.

28:50.361 --> 28:51.525
Doesn't matter.

28:51.661 --> 28:52.859
Given your history,

28:52.994 --> 28:54.290
there isn't a jury in the world

28:54.425 --> 28:55.931
that would believe
you were sober.

28:56.066 --> 28:57.559
But if I was
coming forward voluntarily,

28:57.694 --> 28:59.199
that has to count
for something, right?

28:59.334 --> 29:00.502
If I come forward
and I tell them the truth...

29:00.637 --> 29:01.869
Then your prior DUIs,

29:02.005 --> 29:03.497
and the fact
that you were at a bar,

29:03.633 --> 29:04.839
gives the State
reason to charge you

29:04.975 --> 29:06.310
with first-degree
vehicular homicide

29:06.445 --> 29:07.541
or even felony murder.

29:07.677 --> 29:09.442
That's 30 years to life.

29:09.577 --> 29:10.878
What?

29:11.013 --> 29:12.373
If you were to
come forward right now,

29:12.508 --> 29:13.916
you will be completely screwed.

29:16.486 --> 29:17.417
That's it?

29:17.552 --> 29:18.547
Uh...

29:21.017 --> 29:21.990
[sighs]

29:22.888 --> 29:23.893
I'm sorry.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.096
[Eric] The defense calls
James Sythe, Your Honor.

29:32.532 --> 29:34.802
[Judge Thelma] Please raise
your right hand.

29:34.937 --> 29:36.564
Do you swear to tell the truth,

29:36.700 --> 29:38.835
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

29:38.970 --> 29:40.001
so help you God?

29:40.136 --> 29:41.311
Yes, Your Honor.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.671
All right. Have a seat.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.242
Please state your name
for the record.

29:49.378 --> 29:51.118
Uh, James Michael Sythe.

29:53.453 --> 29:54.924
[Judge Thelma]
Mr. Resnick, your witness.

29:55.059 --> 29:57.427
Okay, James, let's talk
about what happened

29:57.563 --> 29:58.957
the night of October 25th.

29:59.093 --> 30:00.230
Can you tell us what happened?

30:00.365 --> 30:02.125
Yeah, um...

30:02.261 --> 30:03.667
Kendall and I went to Rowdy's

30:03.803 --> 30:06.331
to have a few drinks,
get some food.

30:07.697 --> 30:09.770
We were having fun,
shots and pool,

30:09.905 --> 30:12.041
played some darts, you know.

30:12.177 --> 30:15.435
Now, there's been testimony
that you guys argued.

30:15.570 --> 30:17.646
You don't deny that, do you?

30:17.781 --> 30:19.815
[James] No. No, yeah. Um...

30:19.951 --> 30:22.618
She got really drunk
and she was...

30:22.754 --> 30:23.821
She was giving me a hard time.

30:24.687 --> 30:26.550
What do you mean?

30:26.685 --> 30:29.053
She'd been going on
about us moving in together

30:29.189 --> 30:30.818
for a couple of weeks and I...

30:30.954 --> 30:32.528
<i>just kept telling her
that I didn't think</i>

30:32.663 --> 30:34.254
<i>that I was ready.</i>

30:34.390 --> 30:35.360
We'll... We'll see.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.059
- We'll see.
- What do you mean "We'll see"?

30:39.194 --> 30:41.630
And she just wasn't having it.
She said I didn't love her.

30:43.532 --> 30:45.067
And, uh, she stormed out.

30:45.203 --> 30:46.536
And then what happened?

30:47.746 --> 30:49.779
We argued in the parking lot.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.308
I don't want
to do this anymore.

30:51.443 --> 30:53.279
- Do what?
- I want to go home.

30:53.979 --> 30:55.247
I'm done.

30:55.382 --> 30:56.711
Fine. Get out of here.
Go walk home.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.089
Go walk home then. In the rain.

31:04.823 --> 31:07.157
<i>And she was just
out of her head, you know?</i>

31:07.292 --> 31:09.559
<i>Screaming at me and walked off.</i>

31:10.703 --> 31:12.768
[Eric] <i>And what did you do?</i>

31:12.904 --> 31:14.728
[James] <i>Followed her, at first,</i>

31:14.863 --> 31:17.336
<i>but it was cold,
it was raining.</i>

31:18.634 --> 31:20.676
I remember getting in my car.

31:20.811 --> 31:22.236
So I was parked next to, uh,

31:22.372 --> 31:23.980
<i>mile marker 217.</i>

31:27.186 --> 31:30.888
<i>My niece is born
February 17th, so that just...</i>

31:33.081 --> 31:35.190
<i>I don't know, pulled me
out of everything,</i>

31:35.325 --> 31:37.928
<i>then I turned around
and just drove home.</i>

31:44.894 --> 31:47.868
And, um, we'd see
each other the next day,

31:48.004 --> 31:49.533
and we'd work it out, like...

31:51.036 --> 31:52.041
like always.

31:54.008 --> 31:57.539
Look, was I stupid?

31:57.675 --> 32:00.212
For not wanting
to move in with her?

32:00.347 --> 32:02.216
So I could see
her face every day?

32:04.215 --> 32:05.186
Absolutely, yeah.

32:07.082 --> 32:09.355
But I could never put
my hands on her like that.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.262
I couldn't do that to her.

32:16.293 --> 32:17.495
I... I loved her.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.930
Now, look, I understand,

32:23.065 --> 32:26.109
with my past,
and the mistakes
that I've made,

32:26.244 --> 32:28.737
I know what you're thinking,
I do. And I get it.

32:31.582 --> 32:33.242
But I'm...

32:33.378 --> 32:35.084
I'm not that guy anymore.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.416
Okay, I've changed.

32:39.422 --> 32:41.420
I left that life behind me,
and I, you know...

32:41.555 --> 32:43.257
[voice breaks] I thought
I was doing really good.

32:45.228 --> 32:47.822
[sighs] I don't know
what happened.

32:48.766 --> 32:49.862
I went home. I drove...

32:49.998 --> 32:51.265
I just... I drove home.

32:57.802 --> 32:59.801
I know how difficult
this is for you, James.

33:01.912 --> 33:03.779
You take your time, and...

33:03.915 --> 33:05.312
let me know when you're ready.

33:07.211 --> 33:08.183
I'm good.

33:10.649 --> 33:13.088
I'm gonna show you
a video now, okay?

33:13.224 --> 33:14.849
And then I'm gonna
ask you some questions.

33:16.952 --> 33:19.059
[James on video]
<i>It's fine. I'm not mad.</i>

33:19.194 --> 33:20.721
<i>Why didn't you say it to me?</i>

33:20.857 --> 33:22.494
[country music playing
on video]

33:23.493 --> 33:24.529
[billiard balls clatter]

33:26.331 --> 33:27.863
<i>Did you see that?</i>

33:27.998 --> 33:29.600
<i>- That's for you.</i>
- [Kendall] <i>That's my guy.</i>

33:30.872 --> 33:32.206
[chuckles]

33:32.342 --> 33:34.568
<i>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</i>

33:34.703 --> 33:35.845
<i>Did you miss or make it?</i>

33:35.981 --> 33:36.877
[Kendall] <i>No, I didn't make it.</i>

33:37.013 --> 33:38.677
[James] <i>You missed it.</i>

33:38.813 --> 33:41.117
<i>Well, let me help you.
You're good luck. Come here.</i>

33:41.851 --> 33:42.811
[Kendall] <i>I was.</i>

33:45.623 --> 33:46.650
[Kendall kisses]

33:50.151 --> 33:51.594
[James] <i>Okay,
turn that shit off.</i>

33:51.729 --> 33:52.920
[Kendall] <i>Okay.</i>

33:56.692 --> 33:57.694
[Eric] Who took that video?

33:58.668 --> 33:59.663
Kendall.

34:01.671 --> 34:02.604
When?

34:02.740 --> 34:04.074
October 25th.

34:05.237 --> 34:06.241
Of last year.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.045
And where?

34:09.308 --> 34:11.081
At Rowdy's Hideaway.

34:14.449 --> 34:16.482
Thank you, James.
No more questions.

34:20.386 --> 34:21.883
Prosecution, your witness.

34:22.660 --> 34:24.117
Mr. Sythe,

34:24.252 --> 34:27.057
you just stated that
you loved Kendall Carter.

34:27.193 --> 34:28.965
Is that right?

34:29.101 --> 34:31.230
- More than anything.
- [Faith] Hmm.

34:31.365 --> 34:32.993
And on the night
of October 25th,

34:33.128 --> 34:34.768
you and Kendall drove
to Rowdy's Hideaway.

34:34.904 --> 34:35.837
Is that right?

34:35.972 --> 34:38.403
We took my car, yeah.

34:38.538 --> 34:39.667
And when you got there,
the two of you

34:39.803 --> 34:41.034
started drinking,
is that right?

34:42.208 --> 34:44.344
Yeah. It's a bar.

34:44.479 --> 34:46.274
And then the two of you
started arguing.

34:46.410 --> 34:47.447
Is that right?

34:48.212 --> 34:49.042
Yeah.

34:50.581 --> 34:51.978
And during this argument,

34:52.113 --> 34:54.447
you knocked a beer bottle
off the table.

34:54.583 --> 34:55.719
Is that right?

34:57.225 --> 34:59.293
Yeah, it was an accident.

34:59.429 --> 35:02.455
And then she left,
and you went after her.

35:02.591 --> 35:03.499
Is that right?

35:03.634 --> 35:05.191
Yeah.

35:05.326 --> 35:08.805
And outside, the argument
continued, and... [scoffs]

35:08.940 --> 35:11.073
it is your sworn testimony,

35:11.209 --> 35:13.471
that you left
Kendall Carter alone

35:13.607 --> 35:15.871
to walk down
a narrow two-lane road

35:16.006 --> 35:18.905
in the dark, drunk,
in the pouring rain,

35:19.041 --> 35:20.942
in the middle
of a thunderstorm.

35:23.046 --> 35:24.946
Is that how you treat
someone you love?

35:29.819 --> 35:31.084
No more questions, Your Honor.

35:33.992 --> 35:36.230
Are there any further questions
from the defense?

35:36.365 --> 35:39.335
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.403
Thank you for your testimony,
you can step down.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.610
[Judge Thelma]
Members of the jury,

35:52.745 --> 35:54.882
the evidence in this case
is now closed.

35:55.018 --> 35:56.317
Attorneys, you may give

35:56.452 --> 35:58.681
your closing arguments
at this time.

35:58.817 --> 36:00.883
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

36:02.822 --> 36:06.455
Kendall Carter's murder
was a savage crime

36:06.591 --> 36:08.462
committed by an evil man.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.298
[Eric] <i>An innocent man.</i>

36:11.433 --> 36:15.027
An innocent man
who was shattered

36:15.163 --> 36:18.606
from losing
the love of his life.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.810
We have an eyewitness
who saw him at the crime scene

36:20.945 --> 36:23.039
at the time of death.

36:23.175 --> 36:26.348
In the middle of the night,
in a blinding rainstorm...

36:27.381 --> 36:28.712
it could have been anyone.

36:28.848 --> 36:30.711
When she broke up
with him that night,

36:30.847 --> 36:33.315
and he realized she meant it,

36:33.450 --> 36:34.521
he snapped.

36:35.884 --> 36:37.523
And so he bludgeoned her.

36:37.658 --> 36:40.956
No murder weapon
was recovered. Nothing.

36:41.765 --> 36:43.123
Nothing.

36:43.258 --> 36:46.229
The defendant's DNA
was all over the victim.

36:46.365 --> 36:47.631
No one else's.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.403
[Eric] The State says
there was DNA.

36:49.538 --> 36:52.038
Of course, there was DNA.
Of course.

36:52.174 --> 36:53.540
They were a couple.

36:53.675 --> 36:56.042
[Faith] Yeah, of course,
they were a couple.

36:56.178 --> 36:57.707
Until they weren't.

36:57.842 --> 37:01.844
James Sythe bravely
took the stand

37:01.980 --> 37:04.447
and admitted
to some difficult truths.

37:04.582 --> 37:06.014
[Faith] That? [scoffs]

37:06.149 --> 37:08.885
That was all a performance,
nothing else.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.424
Look...

37:11.560 --> 37:14.727
I think we can
all agree on this.

37:14.862 --> 37:18.059
The person responsible
for Kendall Carter's death

37:19.037 --> 37:20.699
deserves to face justice.

37:21.798 --> 37:24.032
That person is James Sythe.

37:25.205 --> 37:26.309
But that person,

37:27.406 --> 37:28.641
that evil man,

37:29.871 --> 37:31.138
is still out there.

37:33.011 --> 37:36.215
All I ask is that you
deliver a verdict

37:36.350 --> 37:37.650
that speaks the truth.

37:39.116 --> 37:42.020
The truth about
what happened to Kendall.

37:42.156 --> 37:44.789
The truth about what happened
on Old Quarry Road that night.

37:46.393 --> 37:47.891
And the truth about him.

37:51.597 --> 37:52.962
And the truth about him...

37:54.237 --> 37:56.163
is that James Michael Sythe

37:57.270 --> 37:58.275
is guilty.

37:59.305 --> 38:00.904
Find him guilty.

38:02.872 --> 38:05.447
The truth is, James Sythe...

38:06.280 --> 38:08.109
is not guilty.

38:11.286 --> 38:12.652
Find James Sythe...

38:14.188 --> 38:15.248
not guilty.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.054
Thank you.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.495
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

38:26.631 --> 38:27.837
Um, excuse me, everyone.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.801
If... If nobody objects,

38:29.936 --> 38:32.171
I'd really like to throw
my name into the ring

38:32.307 --> 38:33.373
to be the forewoman.

38:33.508 --> 38:34.805
I've served on multiple juries.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.275
- I know the ropes.
- I'm cool with it.

38:36.411 --> 38:37.642
- Yeah. Sure.
- Sure!

38:37.778 --> 38:39.339
- I don't mind.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

38:39.474 --> 38:42.985
Okay. So right now we can do
one of two things.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.645
We can vote and talk,

38:44.780 --> 38:46.121
or talk and vote.

38:46.256 --> 38:47.786
I suggest that we just vote

38:47.921 --> 38:49.422
and just get an idea
where we all stand.

38:49.557 --> 38:51.092
- Does that sound good?
- Agreed.

38:51.228 --> 38:53.929
Okay. So I vote "guilty."

38:54.065 --> 38:56.497
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

38:56.633 --> 39:00.962
Me three. This whole thing
is such a shame.

39:01.098 --> 39:03.839
Yeah. I definitely think
that he did it.

39:03.974 --> 39:04.968
Definitely.

39:06.173 --> 39:07.168
I agree.

39:08.311 --> 39:09.643
Everything fits together.

39:10.674 --> 39:12.415
Yeah. Let him rot.

39:13.775 --> 39:15.448
[woman 1] Amen.

39:15.583 --> 39:19.147
Nine. So that is
nine for guilty.

39:20.486 --> 39:22.291
You, sir? Hi.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.394
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, guilty's cool.

39:25.621 --> 39:26.627
Okay.

39:27.260 --> 39:28.460
And...

39:28.595 --> 39:30.263
Oh! You, sir? How about you?

39:30.399 --> 39:32.061
Kid should have pled out.

39:34.402 --> 39:35.900
And then there was one.

39:39.175 --> 39:40.707
[Justin sighs]

39:45.314 --> 39:47.350
[somber music playing]

39:47.485 --> 39:49.743
All right. So...
what's it gonna be?

39:49.879 --> 39:51.212
You with us or what?

39:52.890 --> 39:54.319
[sighs]

39:54.455 --> 39:55.986
[woman 1 sighs] Tsk.

39:58.993 --> 40:00.590
Don't you want to get home
to your pregnant wife?

40:00.725 --> 40:01.924
Of... Of course I do.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.290
All right.
So what's the problem?

40:04.331 --> 40:05.865
[stammers]

40:06.000 --> 40:07.193
You know, this is somebody's
life we're dealing with.

40:07.329 --> 40:09.538
Shouldn't we at least
talk about it?

40:10.666 --> 40:12.271
[sighs]

40:12.407 --> 40:14.575
This is a joke. [sighs]

40:14.711 --> 40:16.677
No, it's, um...
Look, it's a deliberation.

40:16.812 --> 40:18.906
You are ready to send
this man to prison,

40:19.042 --> 40:20.443
maybe forever, just like that?

40:20.578 --> 40:22.716
[King] And?

40:22.851 --> 40:24.287
I heard the facts
of the case. Did you?

40:24.423 --> 40:26.446
Yeah, right.
The lawyer didn't prove,

40:26.581 --> 40:29.289
beyond a reasonable doubt,
that he was innocent.

40:29.425 --> 40:30.856
Well, he doesn't have to.

40:30.991 --> 40:32.925
The burden of proof
is on the prosecution.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.329
Does anyone have
even the slightest hesitation

40:35.464 --> 40:36.757
that James Sythe is guilty?

40:36.892 --> 40:39.766
[sighs] I mean...

40:39.902 --> 40:41.902
Look, if you have to think,
you aren't sure.

40:42.038 --> 40:43.396
No.

40:43.531 --> 40:45.305
What I'm sure of is,
I got three kids at home

40:45.440 --> 40:46.470
I got to get back to.

40:46.606 --> 40:47.968
Look, we all have lives.

40:48.103 --> 40:49.078
None of us want to be here.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.140
Okay. Um, how about we...

40:51.276 --> 40:53.576
Why don't you just tell us
what your issue is

40:53.712 --> 40:55.584
or your issues are,

40:55.719 --> 40:57.453
and... and then we can
all talk through it?

40:57.589 --> 41:00.479
Oh, I don't have
an... an issue. Uh...

41:00.615 --> 41:02.248
Okay. So you just like
pissing me off, then?

41:02.383 --> 41:04.323
- Or what?
- [scoffs] No. Look, I...

41:04.458 --> 41:05.758
I have questions.

41:05.893 --> 41:08.597
Nah. That's just
your guilt talking.

41:09.925 --> 41:10.863
What do you mean?

41:14.431 --> 41:16.939
You want to go home
to your little neighborhood

41:17.075 --> 41:18.305
and tell them,

41:18.441 --> 41:20.005
"We did right by that boy.

41:20.141 --> 41:23.341
We gave him a fair shake,
just like anybody else."

41:23.476 --> 41:25.810
Whoa, man. Hold up.
Why're you getting on him
like that?

41:25.945 --> 41:26.972
Hey, mind
your own damn business,

41:27.108 --> 41:28.485
all right, little fella?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.652
- Excuse me?
- That's enough. Both of you.

41:33.081 --> 41:35.321
Please, Mr. Kemp, go on.

41:35.456 --> 41:36.493
Thank you, ma'am.

41:37.757 --> 41:39.188
All I'm trying to say is,

41:39.324 --> 41:40.695
let's put everything else
aside for a minute

41:40.830 --> 41:43.457
and just remember
two key points. Um...

41:43.593 --> 41:45.866
One, Sythe went to trial
instead of taking a plea,

41:46.002 --> 41:48.967
and two, he testified
instead of taking the Fifth.

41:49.964 --> 41:51.471
Right? I mean...

41:51.607 --> 41:53.170
it doesn't mean he's innocent,

41:53.305 --> 41:54.636
but I think he's earned
just a few hours of our time

41:54.771 --> 41:56.344
just to be sure.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.714
Uh, he's right. You're right.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.176
We should take the time
and we should go over it.

42:01.312 --> 42:04.220
Fine. Fine,
but it's a waste of time.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.753
Any other group of 12 people

42:05.888 --> 42:07.315
would arrive at the exact same
decision we did.

42:07.450 --> 42:10.021
[woman 1] Mmm-hmm.
That part right there.

42:11.563 --> 42:14.520
The State has the truth
on its side.

42:14.656 --> 42:17.061
James Sythe is going to pay
for what he did.

42:17.196 --> 42:19.394
And I will get justice
for Kendall Carter

42:19.529 --> 42:23.164
and every woman who is
a victim of domestic abuse.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.968
How do you feel
about the latest polling

42:25.104 --> 42:26.809
that a verdict
in the Sythe trial

42:26.945 --> 42:28.638
carries a five-point swing
in the district attorney race?

42:28.774 --> 42:29.840
Oh, come on. You...

42:29.975 --> 42:31.742
You know I can't
comment on that.

42:31.877 --> 42:33.473
Okay. Thank you, everybody.

42:40.187 --> 42:44.623
So I'm just going to start
with what I think

42:44.759 --> 42:47.119
is the most damning evidence.

42:47.255 --> 42:50.125
Which was the man who saw

42:50.260 --> 42:53.000
Sythe on the road,
at the railing,

42:53.135 --> 42:55.400
directly above where
Kendall Carter's
body was found.

42:55.536 --> 42:57.066
Yes, exactly.

42:57.201 --> 42:58.707
So what's left
to even talk about?

42:58.842 --> 43:00.541
Well, I mean, he was
a few hundred feet away,

43:00.676 --> 43:01.840
looking from across the bridge.

43:01.975 --> 43:03.740
And it was
the middle of the night,

43:03.876 --> 43:05.578
and through pouring rain.

43:05.713 --> 43:06.978
Yeah. And I've actually done

43:07.113 --> 43:08.407
a bunch of landscaping
work up there.

43:08.543 --> 43:10.482
That whole area
is covered by trees.

43:10.618 --> 43:11.950
It'd be hard to see.

43:12.086 --> 43:14.314
The man made
a positive identification.

43:14.450 --> 43:16.716
Yeah, but dude's
kind of ancient, though.

43:16.852 --> 43:18.453
[laughs]

43:18.589 --> 43:22.128
Well, this old bird has
20-20 vision with my glasses.

43:22.263 --> 43:24.860
Come on, y'all.
It's his testimony.
He's not lying.

43:24.996 --> 43:26.627
I mean, why would he lie?

43:26.763 --> 43:28.303
And the question here means
that we think he's lying.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.898
I don't think he's lying.

43:30.033 --> 43:31.032
You think he's lying?

43:31.168 --> 43:32.731
No, I don't think he's lying--

43:32.867 --> 43:33.870
[woman 1] Okay. So what
the hell are we talking about?

43:34.006 --> 43:35.403
Look, I'm just saying... Okay.

43:35.538 --> 43:37.411
The man, he saw somebody
at the railing, right?

43:37.547 --> 43:38.609
Can we all agree on that?

43:38.745 --> 43:39.644
- Yeah.
- Yes.

43:39.780 --> 43:41.411
Okay. So isn't it possible

43:41.546 --> 43:43.448
- that he saw someone
other than James Sythe?
- Oh!

43:43.584 --> 43:45.946
Mmm-mmm.
No, we can go back and forth
all day on possibilities.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.414
That's not helpful.

43:47.550 --> 43:48.322
- Well, I think we should.
- No, no, no.

43:48.458 --> 43:49.624
No. That's not our job.

43:49.759 --> 43:51.287
Our job is to just
weigh the facts.

43:52.495 --> 43:54.555
[sighs] Okay. Fact.

43:54.690 --> 43:58.061
32% of homicides occur
between domestic partners.

43:58.197 --> 43:59.964
Fact, the police
arrested James Sythe

44:00.100 --> 44:01.771
two days after
they found the body.

44:01.906 --> 44:04.938
Fact, they never questioned
any other suspects.

44:05.073 --> 44:06.900
You watch too much TV,
old man. [scoffs]

44:07.035 --> 44:08.440
[chuckles]

44:08.576 --> 44:10.944
[sighs] Okay.

44:16.980 --> 44:18.149
You're a cop?

44:19.915 --> 44:21.283
I was.

44:21.418 --> 44:23.484
Twenty-two years.
Robbery-homicide.

44:25.391 --> 44:27.530
Finally took the buyout,
came down here to get away

44:27.665 --> 44:29.630
from those brutal
Midwest winters

44:29.765 --> 44:31.328
and be closer to the grandkids.

44:31.464 --> 44:33.334
Why didn't you... Why didn't
you tell the lawyers?

44:33.470 --> 44:34.829
'Cause nobody asked.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.834
How about that.

44:36.970 --> 44:39.300
Well, their loss is our gain.

44:39.435 --> 44:41.308
So what are you
thinking, officer?

44:41.444 --> 44:42.737
Uh, Detective.

44:42.872 --> 44:43.904
Um...

44:44.039 --> 44:45.580
Look, I think...

44:45.715 --> 44:47.242
It seems to me like the police,

44:47.378 --> 44:48.815
you know, followed
the evidence,

44:48.951 --> 44:50.718
found their guy,
built their case.

44:50.854 --> 44:52.822
Okay. So what's wrong
with that?

44:52.957 --> 44:54.886
It may be nothing,
but tunnel vision like that

44:55.021 --> 44:56.790
can really bite you in the ass.

44:56.926 --> 44:58.957
They feed Sythe
to that eyewitness,

44:59.093 --> 45:01.191
so, of course,
that's who he IDs.

45:01.326 --> 45:03.065
Now they're sure
they got their guy,

45:03.200 --> 45:05.467
so they just ignore anything
that doesn't help their case.

45:05.602 --> 45:08.127
They stop asking questions.

45:08.262 --> 45:09.637
Confirmation bias.

45:09.772 --> 45:11.603
Yeah, confirmation bias.
Exactly.

45:11.738 --> 45:12.770
Confirmation bias.

45:12.906 --> 45:14.670
There's no bad intentions.

45:14.805 --> 45:17.407
It's just a bunch of people
trying to do the right thing,

45:17.543 --> 45:20.744
and they can't see everything
they're doing wrong.

45:20.879 --> 45:23.116
It's a good point.

45:23.252 --> 45:26.717
And what about this blunt
instrument murder weapon

45:26.853 --> 45:28.352
they kept talking about?

45:28.487 --> 45:31.089
The prosecutor said
they couldn't recover it.

45:31.225 --> 45:33.396
So he got rid of it.
That's easy to do.

45:33.531 --> 45:34.896
Or he could have killed her

45:35.031 --> 45:37.661
with something other
than a blunt instrument.

45:37.796 --> 45:38.834
Like what?

45:40.370 --> 45:42.605
Like a car?

45:42.741 --> 45:44.070
It could have been
a hit-and-run.

45:46.168 --> 45:47.468
[Justin] Oh, shit.

45:47.604 --> 45:48.875
- Here. Let me help.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

45:49.011 --> 45:49.773
- It got in your pants.
- It's all right.

45:49.909 --> 45:51.141
You know, that's...

45:51.277 --> 45:53.374
That's a really, really
good theory.

45:53.510 --> 45:55.145
- Hit-and-run.
- [Robinson] Yeah.

45:55.281 --> 45:56.476
I mean, it's raining,
it's night.

45:56.612 --> 45:58.384
Visibility's
got to be terrible.

45:58.519 --> 46:01.086
Well, we know it was slippery,
from that hiker's testimony.

46:01.222 --> 46:03.918
Wandering around
in the dark in heels?

46:04.054 --> 46:06.259
Kids today...

46:06.395 --> 46:10.530
Um, it explains how she could
have ended up in a creek.

46:10.665 --> 46:12.465
[jurors] Mmm-hmm.

46:12.600 --> 46:15.835
Okay. So, Sythe mowed her down
instead of bashing her head in?

46:15.970 --> 46:17.297
What are we talking about here?

46:17.433 --> 46:18.606
What difference does it make?

46:18.741 --> 46:21.142
The guy is a piece of shit.

46:21.278 --> 46:25.445
Look, my gut is telling me
that that kid is not a killer.

46:25.581 --> 46:27.978
- Okay. The other day,
you voted guilty.
- [woman] Mmm-hmm.

46:28.113 --> 46:29.951
No. No, I never said guilty.

46:30.087 --> 46:32.949
I said, he should have
taken a plea bargain.

46:33.084 --> 46:34.715
He's got a weak case.

46:34.850 --> 46:36.585
[woman] Well, maybe there's
a reason for that.

46:36.720 --> 46:39.420
[Chicowski] Yeah. It's called
a public defender.

46:39.555 --> 46:40.660
I mean,
nothing against this guy.

46:40.795 --> 46:42.060
He seems pretty smart,

46:42.196 --> 46:44.924
but... the PDs
are working 10 times

46:45.060 --> 46:48.504
the caseload of the DA's office
on a fraction of the budget.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.133
It's just not a fair fight.

46:50.268 --> 46:52.607
Yeah, well, nothing is anymore.

46:52.743 --> 46:54.309
We'll just do the best we can.

46:54.444 --> 46:55.438
I hear you.

46:57.112 --> 46:59.106
And I got 22 years
on the street,

46:59.241 --> 47:00.982
that is telling me

47:01.118 --> 47:03.678
there's a lot more
to this case than we know.

47:03.813 --> 47:06.322
All right. Then, if you were
still a detective,

47:06.457 --> 47:07.486
what would you do?

47:07.621 --> 47:09.682
Yeah.

47:09.818 --> 47:12.455
All right, y'all.
That's it for today.

47:12.590 --> 47:16.490
See you back here at 9:00 a.m.
Monday morning.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.962
Oh! And I almost forgot.
Happy Halloween.

47:19.098 --> 47:20.870
[jurors] Happy Halloween!

47:23.164 --> 47:24.133
Hey!

47:24.268 --> 47:26.203
Yeah, it has been a minute.

47:26.339 --> 47:28.471
But I was hoping
you could do me a solid.

47:29.612 --> 47:30.572
Hang on a sec.

47:33.010 --> 47:34.510
[engine starts]

47:35.947 --> 47:37.117
Yeah, I'm here.

47:38.413 --> 47:39.779
[car engine starts]

47:47.290 --> 47:49.162
[keyboard clacking]

47:54.496 --> 47:55.938
"We cannot break the law.

47:56.073 --> 47:58.831
"We can only break ourselves
of the law."

48:00.708 --> 48:01.735
[knock at door]

48:02.813 --> 48:03.976
- No decision yet.
- [sighs]

48:04.111 --> 48:05.380
We're breaking for the weekend.

48:05.515 --> 48:07.082
You're kidding.

48:07.217 --> 48:08.908
You never know what
a dozen strangers are gonna do.

48:09.043 --> 48:10.982
Clearly. Okay. Well,
thanks for letting me know.

48:11.118 --> 48:12.382
- See you Monday.
- Mmm-hmm.

48:12.517 --> 48:14.423
- Trick or treat!
- Yeah. Have a good one.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.048
[keyboard clacking]

48:16.184 --> 48:17.322
[sighs]

48:57.294 --> 48:59.892
[somber music playing]

49:03.365 --> 49:04.765
[cell phone rings]

49:15.245 --> 49:16.909
[cell phone rings]

49:20.216 --> 49:21.650
Hey, hon.

49:21.786 --> 49:24.818
Yeah, I'm heading back
to the shop right now.

49:25.660 --> 49:26.655
Okay.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.430
[engine starts]

49:56.790 --> 49:58.387
Hey.

49:58.522 --> 50:00.326
- Hi.
- Did you get my text?

50:02.830 --> 50:03.992
Oh, shit.

50:04.127 --> 50:05.331
Sorry.

50:06.330 --> 50:08.004
I'm sorry, I forgot.

50:08.971 --> 50:10.270
Does everything look okay?

50:12.676 --> 50:13.669
Are you okay?

50:20.015 --> 50:21.648
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

50:21.783 --> 50:22.777
I'm scared.

50:24.785 --> 50:27.353
I'm scared. We didn't make it
this far last time, and...

50:28.020 --> 50:28.981
I'm just scared.

50:30.787 --> 50:32.160
I don't want to be
doing this alone.

50:32.295 --> 50:33.722
I don't want to go
to these things alone.

50:35.029 --> 50:36.594
It's going to be okay.

50:36.730 --> 50:38.166
[stammers] It's going
to be all right, I promise.

50:38.301 --> 50:39.134
I don't understand why
you weren't there today.

50:42.669 --> 50:45.497
How much longer is the trial
going to go on for?

50:45.633 --> 50:48.636
[sighs] I have no idea.

50:48.772 --> 50:50.903
- It's...
- Are you close to a verdict?

50:51.039 --> 50:52.542
I'm not supposed
to discuss the case--

50:52.677 --> 50:54.345
Justin, are you close
to a verdict?

50:54.481 --> 50:57.383
Well, it's ten to two
for guilty.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.914
So then, Monday,

51:01.050 --> 51:02.857
can you just go in
and sway the two holdouts

51:02.992 --> 51:04.683
and then be done with this?

51:04.818 --> 51:07.723
Well, I'm one of them. I...

51:09.526 --> 51:11.323
- Why?
- I'm sorry,

51:11.459 --> 51:12.759
but they took
one look at this guy,
and that was it.

51:12.895 --> 51:14.670
No discussion of
the evidence, nothing.

51:14.805 --> 51:15.830
I had to do something.

51:19.066 --> 51:20.670
Everyone deserves
a chance, right?

51:22.513 --> 51:24.872
I keep thinking where I'd be
if you hadn't given me one.

51:30.385 --> 51:32.079
[stammers] Can I ask
you something?

51:32.215 --> 51:33.919
[sighs]

51:34.054 --> 51:36.588
Yeah, sure. What?

51:36.724 --> 51:38.891
If I were to sell the 4Runner
without telling someone

51:39.026 --> 51:40.758
it was in a wreck,

51:40.894 --> 51:42.559
but they're happy with the deal
and there's no safety risks.

51:42.695 --> 51:44.523
- It was in the ad, Justin.
- I know, I know,

51:44.659 --> 51:45.867
but just go with me.

51:46.002 --> 51:47.935
If they're never the wiser,

51:48.071 --> 51:50.205
then did I do anything wrong?

51:50.772 --> 51:51.734
No.

51:52.910 --> 51:54.275
I mean, I don't think so.

51:55.876 --> 51:56.871
Yeah.

51:59.542 --> 52:00.639
I'm going upstairs.

52:00.775 --> 52:02.745
[melancholy music playing]

52:03.711 --> 52:04.950
Food's in the fridge.

52:05.085 --> 52:06.353
See you upstairs.

52:13.124 --> 52:14.262
[sighs]

52:32.843 --> 52:35.542
There she is.
Next round's on her.

52:35.677 --> 52:37.611
Bourbon. Neat. And...

52:37.746 --> 52:39.011
yeah, whatever he's having.

52:39.146 --> 52:42.552
What I'm having?
What I'm having is a...

52:42.687 --> 52:43.815
- Thank you.
- ...great evening.

52:43.951 --> 52:45.425
Isn't it a beautiful evening?

52:45.560 --> 52:47.486
It should have been
a two-hour verdict.

52:47.621 --> 52:49.757
What can I tell you?
They're taking
their job seriously.

52:49.892 --> 52:51.297
I gave them a lot
to think about.

52:51.433 --> 52:53.794
Mmm. I got a mountain
of evidence.

52:53.930 --> 52:55.532
You gave them
smoke and mirrors.

52:55.668 --> 52:57.137
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

52:57.273 --> 53:01.177
[laughs] I admire
your optimism.

53:01.312 --> 53:02.872
Look, here's the thing.
You walk into court

53:03.007 --> 53:06.709
convinced of the guilt
of the defendant. Me, I...

53:06.844 --> 53:08.247
I have no illusions
about what I do.

53:08.382 --> 53:10.045
A lot of my clients are guilty,

53:10.181 --> 53:13.019
and my job is to help make
the best of a bad situation.

53:13.154 --> 53:15.046
But I'm telling you...

53:15.182 --> 53:17.149
I'm telling you,
this guy didn't do it.

53:20.123 --> 53:23.527
And the fact that the jury's
taking a little time

53:23.663 --> 53:25.195
gives me hope
that things are working

53:25.331 --> 53:26.565
the way they should.

53:28.129 --> 53:31.999
Well... you enjoy that
while it lasts.

53:35.176 --> 53:38.038
To the justice system.

53:38.174 --> 53:41.173
It ain't perfect,
but it's the best we got.

53:51.654 --> 53:52.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.921
I'm sorry again
about yesterday.

53:55.056 --> 53:56.529
It's just that case
wearing on me.

53:57.561 --> 53:58.757
I know. I can tell.

53:58.893 --> 54:00.693
- Yeah.
- Trust your gut.

54:00.829 --> 54:02.269
You'll do the right thing.

54:02.405 --> 54:03.798
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh! Oh, Oh, wait.

54:03.933 --> 54:05.131
- [kids laughing]
- Wait, wait, wait.

54:09.379 --> 54:11.309
- What's that?
- It's my pitchfork.

54:11.444 --> 54:13.079
- Nice!
- Yeah. Thanks.

54:13.215 --> 54:14.481
- [laughs]
- Homemade.

54:17.179 --> 54:19.453
- [kids] Trick or treat!
- Hey! Happy Halloween!

54:19.588 --> 54:22.181
I love your costumes!
Take two, everyone.

54:24.321 --> 54:25.222
Oliver?

54:25.357 --> 54:26.956
Hey, Ms. Crewson.

54:27.092 --> 54:29.897
Oliver, I didn't even
recognize you! How are you?

54:30.033 --> 54:31.461
I'm good. Hi, Mr. Kemp.

54:31.597 --> 54:33.094
Hey, how's the writing going?

54:33.229 --> 54:34.927
- I'm on student paper now.
- No way. That's awesome.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.436
- That's very cool.
- Congrats.

54:36.572 --> 54:38.070
- Hey, have fun tonight.
- [Oliver] We will.

54:38.206 --> 54:39.339
See you back at school?

54:39.474 --> 54:40.907
- Yeah. Next year.
- [Oliver] Okay.

54:41.042 --> 54:42.339
Well, bye.

54:42.475 --> 54:44.079
- Bye!
- Keep it up!

54:44.215 --> 54:46.176
- God, he's a giant.
- I know.

54:46.311 --> 54:47.778
Happy Halloween.

54:52.921 --> 54:53.916
Thanks.

55:06.333 --> 55:07.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

55:07.933 --> 55:10.629
Why'd you follow me
after court on Friday?

55:10.764 --> 55:12.834
I picked your tail up,
like, halfway out of
the parking lot.

55:12.970 --> 55:15.636
I mean, green Toyota
4Runner, right?

55:15.772 --> 55:17.774
Uh, yeah, well, you're...

55:17.910 --> 55:19.178
you're not allowed
to investigate the case

55:19.313 --> 55:20.514
outside the jury room.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.515
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

55:23.651 --> 55:27.114
But... I mean,
somebody's got to.

55:27.250 --> 55:28.614
Don't you want to know
what really happened?

55:28.749 --> 55:30.458
Yeah. Of course.

55:31.390 --> 55:33.026
Look, I, uh...

55:33.162 --> 55:34.121
I did some digging.

55:36.192 --> 55:37.999
This is every registered car
in the county

55:38.135 --> 55:39.633
that was in for body work

55:39.768 --> 55:41.327
between October 26th
and the end of last year.

55:41.463 --> 55:42.899
You're still about
the hit-and-run?
Come on, it's--

55:43.034 --> 55:44.802
Yeah, because that's
a really good theory.

55:44.937 --> 55:47.574
Now, the automakers
keep a detailed list

55:47.709 --> 55:50.609
of these repairs
strictly for R and D purposes.

55:50.745 --> 55:53.042
They collect it
from the dealers pro forma

55:53.178 --> 55:55.350
and then pay the mom-and-pop
shops under the table.

55:55.485 --> 55:56.776
My partner and I
recovered more cars

55:56.912 --> 55:58.377
than an impound this way.

55:58.512 --> 56:00.782
Right. But there must be
hundreds of cars in there.

56:00.918 --> 56:02.787
Yeah, so process
of elimination,

56:02.922 --> 56:05.626
which is what I spent
my whole weekend doing.

56:05.761 --> 56:08.161
I mean, anything there's
already a police report for,

56:08.296 --> 56:09.224
crossed off the list.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.095
Mmm.

56:11.230 --> 56:12.661
And there's only going to be
a very specific kind of damage

56:12.797 --> 56:13.761
with this kind of hit-and-run.

56:13.897 --> 56:16.999
So a headlight, grille, hood.

56:17.134 --> 56:19.606
- Yeah.
- I narrowed it down
to 15 vehicles

56:19.741 --> 56:21.702
that match that description
on this list,

56:21.838 --> 56:23.169
one of which, by the way,

56:23.304 --> 56:26.306
a '96 Toyota 4Runner,
Forest Green.

56:26.442 --> 56:29.051
I mean, that's the exact
same car as yours, right?

56:29.186 --> 56:30.417
I mean, if that is your car,

56:30.553 --> 56:32.551
we can just cross it
off the list.

56:32.687 --> 56:35.983
Right. Yeah.
So what's the plan?

56:36.119 --> 56:38.184
Well, if you
don't mind helping,

56:38.320 --> 56:39.757
there's only so many
hours in the day,

56:39.893 --> 56:41.254
and we got to spend
most of them here.

56:41.389 --> 56:42.626
So you want to help me
with the legwork,

56:42.761 --> 56:44.224
and see if we can find our guy.

56:44.359 --> 56:46.796
Yeah. Okay. You know,
you're reaching, but...

56:46.931 --> 56:48.366
Look, I...
It's a hit-and-run, kid.

56:48.501 --> 56:49.900
I feel it in my bones.

56:50.035 --> 56:52.102
Dollars to doughnuts,
our guy is on this list.

56:52.238 --> 56:56.005
[bailiff] Oh, good morning.
Party time, y'all, let's go.

56:58.544 --> 56:59.945
Fellas, wrap it up.

57:00.081 --> 57:01.274
Thanks.

57:04.154 --> 57:05.179
[bailiff] Let's go.

57:07.551 --> 57:08.483
God damn it!

57:08.619 --> 57:10.654
[grunts] Hmm.

57:10.789 --> 57:12.223
Everything all right over here?

57:12.359 --> 57:13.658
[Justin] Mmm?

57:13.794 --> 57:14.991
[bailiff] Y'all working
my nerve today.

57:16.858 --> 57:18.093
What is all this?

57:22.867 --> 57:25.100
Just... You two, wait for me.

57:27.445 --> 57:30.644
Read instruction
0.01 for me, please.

57:34.676 --> 57:36.145
Uh...

57:36.280 --> 57:37.617
"To maintain the integrity
of the jury system,

57:37.753 --> 57:39.588
I remind you that you must
decide this case

57:39.723 --> 57:41.752
based only on the evidence
admitted during the trial

57:41.888 --> 57:43.853
and the law
I will explain to you.

57:43.989 --> 57:45.523
You may not conduct
any research

57:45.658 --> 57:47.422
on your own about this case

57:47.557 --> 57:50.189
or about any people or places
mentioned during the trial."

57:50.325 --> 57:51.927
Sounds to me
like you two violated

57:52.063 --> 57:53.632
every sentence
of that paragraph.

57:53.768 --> 57:55.036
Your Honor,
I move for a mistrial.

57:55.171 --> 57:56.737
He's a former cop.

57:56.872 --> 57:58.330
Who knows what ideas
he put in the jury's heads.

57:58.466 --> 58:00.266
Failure to elicit
his previous employment

58:00.401 --> 58:03.275
during voir dire
is on you, Mr. Resnick.

58:03.411 --> 58:04.976
[Eric] It's misconduct.

58:05.112 --> 58:06.680
Kick him off, Judge.
There's no need to start over.

58:06.816 --> 58:09.177
Our resources are already
stretched so thin.

58:12.245 --> 58:14.055
She's right. Motion denied.

58:14.191 --> 58:15.623
Your Honor. You know...

58:16.423 --> 58:17.691
As for you two...

58:20.355 --> 58:22.124
You violated
your oath as jurors.

58:24.794 --> 58:26.298
Your Honor...

58:26.433 --> 58:27.833
if I may. I, uh...

58:27.968 --> 58:30.370
I upheld the oath I took
as a police officer

58:30.506 --> 58:32.473
to never betray my character,

58:32.609 --> 58:35.005
my integrity,
or the public trust.

58:40.580 --> 58:42.683
Mr. Chicowski, [sighs]

58:42.818 --> 58:44.916
you are hereby removed
from Jury Service.

58:46.852 --> 58:47.849
On account of your background,

58:47.985 --> 58:49.315
I'm going to make an exception

58:49.451 --> 58:52.055
and not find you
in contempt of court.

58:53.395 --> 58:54.695
Thank you, Your Honor.

58:56.165 --> 58:57.832
So Mr. Kemp,

58:57.968 --> 59:00.024
you are not a retired
law enforcement officer,
are you?

59:00.160 --> 59:01.862
No. No, Your Honor.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.361
So how do you explain

59:03.497 --> 59:07.302
your involvement
in this transgression?

59:07.437 --> 59:10.005
I obtained those documents
on my own, Your Honor.

59:10.140 --> 59:12.042
He didn't have anything
to do with it.

59:13.183 --> 59:14.376
Is that true?

59:14.512 --> 59:15.847
Mmm.

59:15.983 --> 59:17.547
I mean, did you look
at these documents

59:17.683 --> 59:19.281
or help to procure them

59:19.416 --> 59:21.885
or know what Mr. Chicowski
was intending to do?

59:22.021 --> 59:24.356
No, Your Honor.
I did not look at them

59:24.491 --> 59:25.627
and I didn't help.

59:27.763 --> 59:29.893
So do you think
that you can disregard

59:30.028 --> 59:31.864
everything that
you heard just now

59:32.000 --> 59:34.398
and remain an unbiased
member of this panel?

59:34.533 --> 59:35.835
Yes, I can.

59:37.531 --> 59:39.840
I'm going to take you
at your word.

59:39.975 --> 59:43.502
Bailiff, please escort Mr. Kemp
back to the juror room.

59:45.110 --> 59:49.080
Mr. Chicowski,
you are dismissed.

59:49.216 --> 59:51.112
Your Honor, I would ask
that a copy of these documents

59:51.248 --> 59:52.648
be made part
of the court's records

59:52.784 --> 59:53.983
for purposes of appeal.

59:54.119 --> 59:56.285
And again,
I move for a mistrial.

59:56.420 --> 59:59.552
The documents will be marked
as court's Exhibit One.

59:59.687 --> 01:00:03.791
Your motion for a mistrial
is denied, Mr. Resnick.

01:00:03.927 --> 01:00:06.401
Is that understood?

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:09.194
Yes, Your Honor.
It's understood.

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.871
Good. Then we are done here.

01:00:20.277 --> 01:00:22.110
- You got to be kidding me.
- What?

01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:24.279
"Our resources
are stretched so thin"?

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:26.413
You are something.

01:00:30.258 --> 01:00:31.253
Okay.

01:00:33.393 --> 01:00:34.421
[sighs]

01:00:38.399 --> 01:00:39.800
Counselor.

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:40.996
Hey, it's okay.
I'm not on the jury anymore.

01:00:41.131 --> 01:00:42.269
- You don't have to...
- Yeah.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.903
Yeah, made sure of that.

01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:45.740
[sighs]

01:00:46.905 --> 01:00:48.105
Feeling the pressure, huh?

01:00:49.004 --> 01:00:51.380
In this job? Nah.

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:54.540
- [both chuckle]
- Yeah. Okay.

01:01:02.187 --> 01:01:03.655
Hey, I'm...
Sorry, but I just...

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.793
I can't not say this. You...

01:01:07.423 --> 01:01:09.830
[sighs] You got this case
all wrong.

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:12.761
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:01:12.897 --> 01:01:14.030
It's a hit-and-run.

01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:16.435
No way.
ME would have flagged it.

01:01:16.571 --> 01:01:18.738
Well, yeah, you'd think.

01:01:18.874 --> 01:01:21.132
That guy did
five autopsies that day.

01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:23.377
One day. I checked.

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:24.878
Doesn't mean anything.

01:01:29.784 --> 01:01:32.017
Let me just ask you one thing.

01:01:32.153 --> 01:01:34.382
Did you guys ever look
at any other suspect?

01:01:36.424 --> 01:01:38.619
We did our job.

01:01:38.755 --> 01:01:40.685
All due respect, Counselor,
if you'd have done your job,

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.364
I don't think we'd be
standing here right now.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.392
Well, that guy is bad news.

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:47.835
Maybe.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.663
But he didn't kill that girl.

01:01:55.038 --> 01:01:56.877
[pensive music playing]

01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:09.922
[bailiff] All right.
So with that being said,

01:02:10.058 --> 01:02:12.254
Judge Stewart thanks you
for your patience

01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:14.930
and apologizes
for any inconvenience.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.393
Juror number 13 is now
a voting member of this panel.

01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:20.195
Okay.

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:22.100
I'll let you guys
get back to it.

01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:27.540
So what happened?

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:29.810
What was this misconduct?

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:31.742
Uh, that's between
him and the judge.

01:02:31.878 --> 01:02:34.040
Bullshit. You were there.

01:02:34.176 --> 01:02:35.476
What did Harold do?

01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:40.178
He was investigating
the case on his own.

01:02:40.314 --> 01:02:41.350
The judge sent him home.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.258
What about
that stack of papers?

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:45.383
What papers?

01:02:45.518 --> 01:02:47.193
The ones Harold gave to him.

01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:49.064
You dropped them
all over the floor.
We all saw it.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:52.293
The bailiff was on us before
I looked at the papers, so...

01:02:52.428 --> 01:02:54.394
You were talking
for quite a while.

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:56.398
Did he tell you
what was in them?

01:02:58.398 --> 01:03:00.238
Okay, yes, he did. It...

01:03:00.373 --> 01:03:03.335
It was a printout.
Names, vehicle registrations...

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:06.105
He said that it could prove

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.240
James Sythe's innocence.

01:03:07.376 --> 01:03:09.377
- [all murmuring]
- So what?

01:03:09.513 --> 01:03:10.714
Are we just supposed
to believe you now

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:12.049
and change our vote?

01:03:12.185 --> 01:03:13.283
No, I'm just telling you
what I know.

01:03:15.384 --> 01:03:17.056
He thinks it was a hit-and-run.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.751
So if he thinks
it was a hit-and-run...

01:03:57.192 --> 01:03:58.900
Kendall was 5'5".

01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:03.001
If she was hunched over,

01:04:03.136 --> 01:04:06.236
and the car was
an SUV or a truck,

01:04:06.371 --> 01:04:07.907
she could have easily
have been hit

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:09.878
smack across
the head and torso.

01:04:12.312 --> 01:04:14.849
Look at the way
her shoulders are fractured.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.116
Well, I'm sorry,
but are you a doctor?

01:04:18.448 --> 01:04:21.146
Not yet.
Third-year med student.

01:04:21.281 --> 01:04:22.815
I... I mean,

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.620
I think we should leave
that to the professionals,

01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:26.519
the medical examiner who,
you know, examined the body.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:29.328
Well, I mean,
doctors can be careless.

01:04:29.464 --> 01:04:31.566
One time they told my dad
he was having a heart attack.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.593
Turned out it was just gas.

01:04:33.729 --> 01:04:36.264
[chuckles] They're always
in such a rush.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.269
Go ahead, dear.
Speak your mind.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:46.074
The right and left clavicle
both show a very clean break.

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:47.542
Can you pass this around?

01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:50.743
She couldn't get that
from the fall?

01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:53.416
It's not likely.

01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:58.217
Both bones had to be broken
by a single,

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:00.852
sharp, posterior impact.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.294
Pow.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:07.397
Do we know if Sythe's car
had any damage?

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.362
No. The police
would have noted it

01:05:10.498 --> 01:05:11.829
in their report if it did.

01:05:11.965 --> 01:05:13.267
Not if they thought
it was irrelevant.

01:05:13.403 --> 01:05:15.438
[scoffs] Cops hate paperwork.

01:05:15.573 --> 01:05:17.272
So you're some kind
of secret cop now, too?

01:05:17.407 --> 01:05:19.738
[laughs] No. I'm a dog groomer,

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.577
but I watch and listen
to a lot of true crime,

01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:24.612
and the first rule
is the husband did it.

01:05:25.653 --> 01:05:27.086
Okay, well,

01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:29.087
husband, boyfriend.
Same difference.

01:05:29.222 --> 01:05:30.723
You agree
that he's guilty, right?

01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:31.989
He is the perfect suspect.

01:05:32.124 --> 01:05:33.388
[King] All right. Thank you.

01:05:33.524 --> 01:05:34.819
But the second rule
of true crime

01:05:34.955 --> 01:05:37.229
is that it's never
the perfect suspect.

01:05:38.061 --> 01:05:39.395
Oh, my God.

01:05:39.531 --> 01:05:42.235
I'm just sharing with you
my experiences.

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:45.402
Your experiences?
Listening to crime podcasts.

01:05:45.537 --> 01:05:47.372
Well, hold on.
And watching <i>Dateline.</i>

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.972
Okay. Well, that doesn't
make you Sherlock Holmes.

01:05:50.108 --> 01:05:51.472
Oh, thank you. [laughs]

01:05:51.608 --> 01:05:53.541
No, you burn
through enough cases,

01:05:53.677 --> 01:05:56.250
and you start to see
certain patterns.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.310
But I leave the detective work
to the forum lawyers.

01:05:58.445 --> 01:05:59.911
Okay, good. Good.

01:06:00.047 --> 01:06:01.584
Because we're not here
to solve a mystery, okay?

01:06:01.719 --> 01:06:03.684
All we're here to do
is decide if we're positive

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.617
James Sythe killed
Kendall Carter. That's it.

01:06:06.753 --> 01:06:07.694
- [woman 2] May I?
- Oh.

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:08.821
[med student] I'm not.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:13.596
Old Quarry Road
feeds into the highway.

01:06:13.732 --> 01:06:16.470
When traffic's heavy,
GPS will send you that way.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:17.973
It gets busy.

01:06:18.108 --> 01:06:20.468
Yeah, and at night,
I mean, it's gnarly.

01:06:20.604 --> 01:06:23.077
I nearly mowed down
a deer once.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.639
[man] What if that's what
they thought?

01:06:25.572 --> 01:06:26.740
[Aldworth] Who thought?

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:30.447
Whoever hit Kendall Carter.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.681
Yeah, man. I mean,
that all makes sense,

01:06:34.817 --> 01:06:37.025
but, you know, what about
our eyewitness?

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:40.354
Maybe he saw someone else?

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.963
Okay, hold up. Wait a minute.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.165
Y'all got way too many
"maybes" for my liking.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.261
Yeah, and too many maybes
is reasonable doubt.

01:06:47.397 --> 01:06:48.465
[man] I agree with Justin.

01:06:49.802 --> 01:06:50.797
Yeah.

01:06:52.674 --> 01:06:54.108
Okay. Keiko?

01:06:58.514 --> 01:06:59.509
Nellie?

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:04.850
I'm not sure any more that
this young man is guilty.

01:07:04.986 --> 01:07:07.022
Right. Okay. Anyone else?

01:07:08.382 --> 01:07:09.321
Not guilty.

01:07:09.855 --> 01:07:11.385
Okay.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.589
[suspenseful music playing]

01:07:17.799 --> 01:07:19.159
[sighs softly]

01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.466
[man grunting]

01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:25.170
I fell asleep on Highway 17
and woke up in a ditch.

01:07:25.306 --> 01:07:26.800
Thank God the hospital
was close.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:30.738
Hmm. Okay.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:33.943
Thank you for your time.

01:07:34.078 --> 01:07:36.282
[man] Yep.

01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:38.586
Yeah, we were street racing
down Greek Row.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:39.879
It was dumb. I know.

01:07:46.157 --> 01:07:47.194
[chuckles softly]

01:07:49.796 --> 01:07:50.824
[sighs]

01:08:07.913 --> 01:08:08.908
Guilty.

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:11.779
Guilty.

01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:16.388
Not guilty.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.886
Not guilty.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.462
Guilty.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.598
All right. It looks like
we're six to six.

01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:30.871
We're deadlocked.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.537
Okay, so what do we do now?

01:08:32.672 --> 01:08:35.433
Feels like the more we talk,
the less we know.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.975
I'm so tired.

01:08:38.111 --> 01:08:40.842
You're so stoned, dear.

01:08:40.977 --> 01:08:42.641
- [mouthing]
- Let's go back
to the beginning.

01:08:42.776 --> 01:08:44.647
Build a case piece by piece.

01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:47.815
No, no. Let's stop
wasting our damn time.

01:08:47.951 --> 01:08:50.785
How about we all just
take a breath. It's...

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.419
It's been a long day,
but, you know, votes...

01:08:52.555 --> 01:08:53.661
votes have changed, right?

01:08:53.797 --> 01:08:55.196
The process is working.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.032
[woman] No, it's not.
You are wearing us down.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.927
Talking a lot,
but saying nothing.

01:09:01.063 --> 01:09:03.301
I mean, hell, you go over
anything enough times,

01:09:03.436 --> 01:09:04.939
yeah, we'll start
to question it.

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:07.335
Yeah. Like which shoes to wear.

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.740
Yeah. Look... [sighs]

01:09:09.876 --> 01:09:12.609
We got all these theories,
y'all, but no new evidence.

01:09:12.744 --> 01:09:14.347
Well, yeah, but those
theories are making

01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:16.251
some of us question
James Sythe's guilt.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.016
No. No, no. You can
question it all you want,

01:09:19.152 --> 01:09:21.288
but I know he's guilty.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.324
Just look at his damn neck.

01:09:26.252 --> 01:09:28.026
Hey, my man. I know you
got a picture of him

01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:29.164
in that book of yours.

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:34.433
I mean, yeah,
but it's not perfect, but...

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:37.903
Yes. See? Right there.

01:09:38.038 --> 01:09:40.006
Snake and a crown.

01:09:40.141 --> 01:09:41.639
That's the West Side Crowns.

01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:44.339
They're the biggest
drug pushers in the city.

01:09:44.474 --> 01:09:45.706
How do you know that?

01:09:45.842 --> 01:09:48.040
Because I run
the Boys and Girls Club.

01:09:48.175 --> 01:09:51.186
These guys are poisoning
their own community.

01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:55.518
This case is personal to you.

01:09:55.654 --> 01:09:56.983
Yeah, well, you're
damn right it is.

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:04.325
My little brother was 14

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.728
when he got inked.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:11.798
A month before
his 17th birthday,
he was dead.

01:10:11.934 --> 01:10:13.670
Caught a stray bullet
in some...

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:17.476
tit-for-tat turf bullshit.

01:10:19.873 --> 01:10:22.007
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

01:10:22.143 --> 01:10:24.879
Yeah, that's right.
You have no idea.

01:10:28.382 --> 01:10:33.492
Look, Sythe did say
that he left that life behind.

01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:35.593
There's only one way
to leave that crew.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.058
So...

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:42.198
You can keep talking
about your theories.

01:10:42.334 --> 01:10:43.898
Look, people can change.

01:10:44.033 --> 01:10:45.235
[King] Yeah.
Keep telling yourself that.

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:46.532
I... I do. Every day.

01:10:46.668 --> 01:10:48.541
Well, I drive a bus,

01:10:48.676 --> 01:10:50.437
and I see the same people
day in and day out,

01:10:50.573 --> 01:10:51.904
and they do not change.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.410
Well, then how
am I sitting here?

01:10:54.545 --> 01:10:55.574
What are you talking about?

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:56.713
I should be dead.

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:58.715
I should...

01:11:00.013 --> 01:11:02.154
A little over four years ago,

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:03.586
I wrapped my car around a tree

01:11:03.722 --> 01:11:05.656
with a blood alcohol
level that,

01:11:05.791 --> 01:11:07.126
you know, probably
should have killed me

01:11:07.261 --> 01:11:08.424
before I even got in the car

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.121
and somehow... [clears throat]

01:11:11.257 --> 01:11:12.625
walked away
with barely a scratch.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.126
[King] Mmm. Lucky you.

01:11:14.261 --> 01:11:16.035
[Justin] Yeah. Yeah,
part of my sentence

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.636
was community service.

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:18.940
I spent three days a week
in an elementary school

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:21.034
teaching kids how to write.

01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:24.772
Uh... Alcoholics,
we can charm anybody.

01:11:24.908 --> 01:11:27.408
But the teacher
I was reporting to,

01:11:27.544 --> 01:11:28.773
I mean, she was Teflon.

01:11:28.909 --> 01:11:30.883
She saw right through me.

01:11:31.018 --> 01:11:32.585
And she...

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:35.323
She made me finally want to,
you know, own my shit

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.216
and just take
responsibility for myself.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:41.523
I'm... [clears throat]

01:11:41.659 --> 01:11:43.023
I'm still not sure what I did

01:11:43.158 --> 01:11:44.594
to get a woman like her
to give me a chance.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:48.433
But her belief
and believing in myself,

01:11:48.569 --> 01:11:50.864
that I could change,
that was...

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.967
That was, you know,
the first step.

01:11:54.007 --> 01:11:55.435
And...

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:56.969
Look, the, uh...

01:11:57.104 --> 01:11:59.372
the journey never ends,
I know that...

01:11:59.507 --> 01:12:00.612
But...

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:02.845
that's...

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:05.652
that's four years.

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:08.719
And am I the same man
that I was four years ago? No.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:10.890
Absolutely not.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.488
Yeah, well...

01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:14.329
Now I can see... [chuckles]

01:12:15.491 --> 01:12:16.595
You changed.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.631
But guys like James Sythe,

01:12:20.497 --> 01:12:22.159
they don't change.

01:12:22.295 --> 01:12:24.537
Okay. Think back
to his testimony.

01:12:24.672 --> 01:12:28.370
That was raw and real,
and I believed it.

01:12:28.506 --> 01:12:30.476
Wait, hold on, gang.

01:12:30.611 --> 01:12:32.541
If Sythe didn't do it,
then who did?

01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:34.648
We don't have to answer that.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:36.450
So no one's going to pay for
what happened to that girl?

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:38.945
- No, someone will pay.
- How do you know that?

01:12:39.081 --> 01:12:40.548
Because somebody
always does. Look...

01:12:40.684 --> 01:12:42.015
Look, I get how you feel,

01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:44.819
but you can't let
your feelings sway you.

01:12:44.954 --> 01:12:46.519
You don't know
anything about me, man.

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:47.725
All right.

01:12:50.728 --> 01:12:52.860
How... how old's your daughter?

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:54.435
That's her
on the key chain, right?

01:12:57.302 --> 01:12:59.005
Yeah. She, um...

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.241
She turned 16 in March.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.674
How often do you
get to see her?

01:13:05.212 --> 01:13:06.908
Not often enough.

01:13:07.044 --> 01:13:09.613
You know, during the trial,
I was sat

01:13:09.749 --> 01:13:11.346
right in Kendall's
parents' eyeline.

01:13:11.482 --> 01:13:12.552
I could see...

01:13:14.146 --> 01:13:15.851
I mean, their pain each day.

01:13:15.987 --> 01:13:18.217
And, you know, what if
she were your daughter?

01:13:19.159 --> 01:13:20.493
[stammers]

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.489
You want justice, right?
An eye for an eye.

01:13:22.624 --> 01:13:24.358
Right. Yeah.

01:13:24.493 --> 01:13:26.190
But then James Sythe's family
was in court each day, too.

01:13:26.326 --> 01:13:27.834
You know, his grandma
and his niece.

01:13:27.969 --> 01:13:29.665
Uh...

01:13:29.801 --> 01:13:31.736
What if he were
your son, right?

01:13:33.334 --> 01:13:34.739
Wouldn't you want justice
for him, too?

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.612
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose, I would.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:42.175
[Robinson sighs]

01:13:51.084 --> 01:13:53.087
[suspenseful music playing]

01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:19.247
[engine roars]

01:14:19.383 --> 01:14:20.455
[sighs]

01:14:27.889 --> 01:14:29.893
So how can I help you?

01:14:30.028 --> 01:14:31.395
Well, I just want
to have a little chat

01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:32.793
about what happened here.

01:14:32.929 --> 01:14:34.469
Just have a little one on one.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:35.963
Maybe I could get
some more information

01:14:36.099 --> 01:14:39.233
if something came to you
new, you know?

01:14:39.368 --> 01:14:43.175
Well, like I said at the trial,
the police come by.

01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:44.776
Showed me a picture,

01:14:44.912 --> 01:14:46.447
asked me if he was the man
I saw that night.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.974
Mmm. They show you
any other pictures?

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.814
Oh, no. They knew it was him.

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:53.546
They... They just needed me
to confirm it.

01:14:53.681 --> 01:14:54.852
Right.

01:14:55.851 --> 01:14:57.115
I was happy to do so.

01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:00.055
I mean, everyone
was so generous.

01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:03.055
And if I could say so,
it felt pretty good

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:05.566
- to be needed again.
- Mmm.

01:15:06.332 --> 01:15:08.066
I'm sure it did.

01:15:08.201 --> 01:15:10.196
All right. Well,
if there's anything else
I can do for you,

01:15:10.332 --> 01:15:12.571
just give a holler.
Tea is always hot.

01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:14.031
[chuckles] Okay.
Thank you so much.

01:15:14.167 --> 01:15:15.141
Thanks for your time, sir.

01:15:15.276 --> 01:15:16.643
Uh, James Sythe...

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.780
He did kill that girl, right?

01:15:26.517 --> 01:15:27.819
[exhales]

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.389
Okay, so does anybody else
want to change their vote?

01:15:33.524 --> 01:15:34.958
[chuckles]

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:37.191
Uh, well...

01:15:38.994 --> 01:15:40.025
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.897
[Aldworth] What do you mean?

01:15:42.033 --> 01:15:44.504
Because I haven't
changed my mind.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.832
All right, well,
let's just keep talking.

01:15:45.968 --> 01:15:49.071
No, no, I'm done talking.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.205
Marcus.

01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:54.379
So what? You're gonna
tell the judge, we...

01:15:54.515 --> 01:15:56.546
we can't reach a verdict?

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:58.342
[woman] It is what it is.

01:15:58.477 --> 01:16:00.177
But we're actually
making progress.

01:16:00.313 --> 01:16:03.252
- [scoffs] Progress?
- Yeah.

01:16:03.388 --> 01:16:05.616
How can we continue if we
can't even reach a verdict?

01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:08.354
We've been at this for
I don't even know how long.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.422
My kids need me.

01:16:12.227 --> 01:16:13.898
I'm just trying
to do my job here.

01:16:15.027 --> 01:16:17.562
Okay? Um...

01:16:17.697 --> 01:16:19.638
Courtney, what about you?
Do you want to keep going?

01:16:19.774 --> 01:16:22.368
I don't know.
Look, he yelled at her.

01:16:22.503 --> 01:16:25.171
He grabbed her arm.
He called her a bitch.

01:16:25.307 --> 01:16:27.413
He was possessive
and temperamental.

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:30.409
No, he was abusive. Screw him.

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.379
Yeah. You're right.

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.512
Screw him.

01:16:35.648 --> 01:16:37.458
Great. [chuckles]
For the third time,

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:38.851
I get to go home
and tell my husband,

01:16:38.987 --> 01:16:39.918
"Guess what, honey?

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.353
[laughs] I did nothing."

01:16:42.489 --> 01:16:44.522
He gets a real kick
out of that.

01:16:44.658 --> 01:16:46.733
I'm sorry, Denice.
I'm not changing my vote.

01:16:47.599 --> 01:16:49.102
Neither am I.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.232
Yeah. Me, too.

01:16:55.972 --> 01:16:57.238
[man] So what do we do then?

01:16:57.904 --> 01:16:58.910
Um...

01:17:00.373 --> 01:17:02.144
there's one thing we could try.

01:17:03.584 --> 01:17:06.181
[sighs] Madam Foreperson.

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.752
Sending a jury
to visit a crime scene

01:17:09.888 --> 01:17:11.283
once deliberations have begun

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:13.824
is not something
I would typically allow.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.321
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

01:17:15.457 --> 01:17:18.290
this has not been
a typical deliberation.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.125
But I do think
it will be beneficial

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:21.936
in helping us reach a verdict.

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:22.967
I see.

01:17:25.738 --> 01:17:27.103
Mr. Resnick. Any objections?

01:17:28.133 --> 01:17:29.474
No, Your Honor.

01:17:29.609 --> 01:17:30.843
Okay, Miss Killebrew?

01:17:32.877 --> 01:17:34.576
The State's fine with it.

01:17:34.711 --> 01:17:35.749
All right, then.

01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:39.147
Here are the rules.

01:17:39.283 --> 01:17:41.655
During your visit,
you are not to speak

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:43.615
to anyone outside
of your jury panel,

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:48.322
nor are you to speak to
each other about this case.

01:17:48.457 --> 01:17:50.357
All right, you are there
to view the locations

01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:53.493
in and around where
the crime took place.

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:58.165
And you are not to collect
evidence of any kind.

01:17:58.301 --> 01:18:00.531
Does everyone
understand these rules?

01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:02.571
- Yes, ma'am.
- [jurors] Yes, Your Honor.

01:18:02.706 --> 01:18:03.744
All right, then.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.307
This court is adjourned.

01:18:08.474 --> 01:18:10.245
Hey. Hey. Can... Can we talk?

01:18:12.218 --> 01:18:14.216
Yeah, great. Great.
I'll see you there. Thanks.

01:18:15.851 --> 01:18:17.054
[knock at door]

01:18:20.119 --> 01:18:21.652
[knocks at door]

01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:31.670
Hello?

01:18:31.805 --> 01:18:34.232
Oh, hey, are you
Allison Crewson?

01:18:34.368 --> 01:18:36.070
Yes, I am. Yeah. Who are you?

01:18:36.205 --> 01:18:37.834
I'm, um... I'm Faith Killebrew.

01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:40.544
I'm a prosecutor with
the District Attorney's office.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.740
Do you mind if we talk?

01:18:42.876 --> 01:18:44.680
I was just about to lay down,
but what is this about?

01:18:44.816 --> 01:18:46.983
It'll only be a minute.

01:18:47.118 --> 01:18:48.921
- Okay. Come in.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:18:55.325 --> 01:18:56.757
Uh, I'm sorry
for the intrusion.

01:18:56.892 --> 01:18:58.628
I won't be long.

01:18:58.764 --> 01:19:00.560
I'm following up on a...

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.066
on a few different accidents
from October last year,

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:05.095
just doing routine checks
on any cars

01:19:05.231 --> 01:19:07.899
that were serviced
for major body damage
around that time.

01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:09.135
Okay.

01:19:09.271 --> 01:19:11.108
So on October 25th last year,

01:19:11.243 --> 01:19:14.707
did you own a 1996
green Toyota 4Runner?

01:19:14.843 --> 01:19:16.378
Yes.

01:19:16.513 --> 01:19:17.783
Mmm-hmm. And do you remember
having any body work

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.281
- done on it around that time?
- Yeah.

01:19:20.416 --> 01:19:23.414
Okay. And how was
your car damaged?

01:19:23.549 --> 01:19:25.282
My husband, Justin, hit a deer.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:27.058
Okay. Any idea where?

01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:29.720
Up on Brimstone Pass.

01:19:30.596 --> 01:19:31.693
You sure?

01:19:31.829 --> 01:19:34.692
[laughs] Yeah.

01:19:34.827 --> 01:19:36.870
Could it have been
Old Quarry Road? Or...

01:19:38.431 --> 01:19:40.137
No, it was Brimstone Pass.

01:19:41.706 --> 01:19:42.700
You're positive.

01:19:43.774 --> 01:19:44.944
Positive.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.476
Okay. Great.
Well, that's all I have.

01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:53.953
Thank you very much
for your time, Mrs. Crewson.

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:56.549
And, uh, congratulations.
When are you due?

01:19:57.787 --> 01:19:59.117
Uh...

01:19:59.252 --> 01:20:00.485
Yeah, any day now.

01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:01.960
[laughs] Well,
good luck with that.

01:20:02.096 --> 01:20:03.756
You want me to do anything
before I go?

01:20:03.892 --> 01:20:05.261
- No, no. No.
- Okay. Well, I'll just
see myself out.

01:20:05.396 --> 01:20:06.690
- No. I'll get you...
- No, you stay there.

01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:08.630
- Okay, all right.
- No, it's good. [laughs]

01:20:08.766 --> 01:20:09.634
- Have a good one.
- Thank you.
Thanks for your time.

01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:10.299
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.032
[door closes]

01:20:12.167 --> 01:20:13.841
[tense music playing]

01:20:27.115 --> 01:20:28.955
[bell ringing]

01:20:32.225 --> 01:20:34.453
Hey. Sorry I couldn't
meet you earlier.

01:20:34.589 --> 01:20:36.263
- No worries.
- What's on your mind?

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.321
The trial.

01:20:37.456 --> 01:20:39.291
Well, yeah, I figured.

01:20:39.426 --> 01:20:40.993
It's headed for a hung jury.

01:20:41.129 --> 01:20:42.166
[man] Justin!

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:45.034
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:47.664
- I got you a coffee.
- Thanks.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.601
Obviously, I want
to acquit the guy,

01:20:49.737 --> 01:20:52.108
but if the jury hangs,
it's a mistrial, right?

01:20:52.243 --> 01:20:54.607
- That's right.
- So problem solved.

01:20:54.742 --> 01:20:56.542
Well, given all the press
on this case,

01:20:56.678 --> 01:20:58.778
the public's going
to demand a retrial.

01:20:58.914 --> 01:21:01.119
We're just gonna have to do it
all over again with Sythe.

01:21:01.255 --> 01:21:03.089
Unless the District Attorney's
office decides

01:21:03.224 --> 01:21:06.687
that he's not the guy,
then they'll find the guy.

01:21:06.823 --> 01:21:09.021
And there's no way that this
case ends without a verdict.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:11.556
Once they get that,
then, yeah, it's over.
Then it's done.

01:21:11.692 --> 01:21:13.527
So you're saying
I need a verdict?

01:21:14.228 --> 01:21:15.397
I'm afraid so.

01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:31.347
[sighs]

01:21:32.711 --> 01:21:34.746
Hey, can you meet me at County?

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:56.405
[Allison] Hey.

01:21:57.404 --> 01:21:59.771
Hey. Everything okay?

01:22:01.809 --> 01:22:04.050
Just checking the car.
Might have a buyer.

01:22:10.453 --> 01:22:11.926
Where'd you hit
that deer again?

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.161
Up on Brimstone Pass, right?

01:22:17.762 --> 01:22:18.625
Mmm.

01:22:20.466 --> 01:22:22.398
Are you sure that
it wasn't Old Quarry Road?

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:24.939
I'm positive.

01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:26.831
That's...

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:29.668
Just that's ex...

01:22:29.803 --> 01:22:32.238
"Positive," that's what
I said to the...

01:22:32.374 --> 01:22:33.938
prosecutor from your trial

01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:36.280
when she just interrogated me
in our living room.

01:22:37.512 --> 01:22:38.810
- What? She was here.
- Yeah.

01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:42.616
I looked her up.
She wanted to know about
your accident.

01:22:44.217 --> 01:22:45.223
That--

01:22:46.926 --> 01:22:48.329
What'd you tell her?

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:49.425
The truth.

01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:53.099
That you hit a deer

01:22:54.065 --> 01:22:55.398
up on Brimstone Pass.

01:22:56.868 --> 01:22:58.830
Okay. Good.

01:23:00.468 --> 01:23:01.602
That is the truth, right?

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.802
Did you take the shortcut...

01:23:05.938 --> 01:23:07.476
home through
Old Quarry that night?

01:23:09.678 --> 01:23:11.612
Did you stop
at Rowdy's Hideaway?

01:23:15.854 --> 01:23:16.881
[Allison sighs]

01:23:23.027 --> 01:23:24.064
Did you drink?

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.726
[sighs softly]

01:23:32.705 --> 01:23:33.700
Did you?

01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:37.737
Justin. Did you drink?

01:23:39.279 --> 01:23:41.813
- Talk to me.
- No, no, I didn't drink.

01:23:41.949 --> 01:23:43.941
I didn't drink. Okay? I...

01:23:47.186 --> 01:23:48.847
I stopped and I [stammering]...

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:50.520
I ordered the drink,
but I didn't touch it.

01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:52.558
Ordered, but didn't drink.
Why would I believe that?

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:54.393
- Because that's the truth.
I promise. I swear.
- You swear?

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.219
Why should I believe that?
Why should I believe anything

01:23:56.355 --> 01:23:57.623
- that you're saying anymore?
- I promise. I swear to you.

01:23:57.759 --> 01:23:58.865
- I swear to you.
- You swear to me?

01:23:59.001 --> 01:23:59.897
- I swear.
- Don't lie to me.

01:24:00.033 --> 01:24:01.031
I'm not lying. I promise.

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.963
I promise. That is the truth.

01:24:03.098 --> 01:24:03.895
Okay?

01:24:05.266 --> 01:24:06.304
Look, it...

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:09.175
It...

01:24:11.071 --> 01:24:13.408
It was the twins' due date
and I couldn't deal

01:24:13.544 --> 01:24:14.571
with the feelings
that I was having.

01:24:14.707 --> 01:24:16.415
I couldn't deal with them,

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.184
so I didn't want to bring them
home and put them on you.

01:24:18.917 --> 01:24:20.184
So I went there.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.919
I sat there for a while,
and then I...

01:24:22.054 --> 01:24:23.850
and then I came home.

01:24:23.985 --> 01:24:26.056
[voice shaking] Why didn't
you tell me any of this?

01:24:26.192 --> 01:24:27.855
Why did you keep this from me?

01:24:27.991 --> 01:24:29.059
- I wanted... I wanted to.
- You could've talked to me.

01:24:29.195 --> 01:24:30.289
But you were in so much pain.

01:24:30.425 --> 01:24:32.694
Of course I was in pain.

01:24:32.829 --> 01:24:34.431
I kept thinking that I was
somehow responsible,

01:24:34.567 --> 01:24:35.934
that it was my fault,
that it's still my...

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.467
No. No. It was not your fault.

01:24:37.602 --> 01:24:38.938
- They were my babies.
- It's not... It's not...

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.702
- They were our babies.
- I know.

01:24:40.837 --> 01:24:43.735
None... None... None of this
is your fault, okay?

01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:45.937
We were both hurting.
It still hurts.

01:24:48.475 --> 01:24:49.578
I'm still hurting.

01:24:53.687 --> 01:24:54.583
Me, too.

01:24:56.317 --> 01:24:57.784
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:03.796
[sighs]

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.195
I'm not doing this alone.

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:08.227
No, you're not. You're not.

01:25:08.362 --> 01:25:09.563
You are not.

01:25:09.698 --> 01:25:12.601
I will protect our family.
I will.

01:25:14.808 --> 01:25:16.242
I promise. Okay?

01:25:19.475 --> 01:25:21.412
Hey, come here. Come here.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.744
[sighs]

01:25:37.493 --> 01:25:38.789
What the hell is going on?

01:25:38.924 --> 01:25:40.825
- Ugh, I need to see him.
- Why?

01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.165
I need him
to look me in the eye

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.467
and tell me he didn't do it.

01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:46.466
So you're having doubts?

01:25:46.602 --> 01:25:47.641
I'm right. You're doubting it?

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:49.635
I... I don't know.

01:25:49.771 --> 01:25:51.278
What do you mean
you don't know?

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:52.638
Come on. You know
something isn't right here.

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:54.741
The jury knows it. It's just...

01:25:54.876 --> 01:25:56.609
Can you prove
that's what happened?

01:25:56.744 --> 01:25:58.944
Can you prove it didn't?
Can you?

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.012
[Faith] I don't know.
Just get me in there.

01:26:04.925 --> 01:26:06.160
[door buzzes]

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:13.662
[door slams]

01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:17.864
What are you doing here?

01:26:19.664 --> 01:26:20.636
Have a seat.

01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:23.507
I shouldn't be talking to you.

01:26:24.537 --> 01:26:25.509
It's okay.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.011
What do you want?

01:26:34.317 --> 01:26:36.252
Same thing as you.

01:26:36.387 --> 01:26:37.851
Justice for Kendall Carter.

01:26:37.986 --> 01:26:39.886
So go find the son of a bitch
who did it.

01:26:42.557 --> 01:26:44.229
Look, there's no jury,

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.891
no judge, no cameras.
So just...

01:26:47.027 --> 01:26:48.328
tell me what happened
that night.

01:26:48.464 --> 01:26:50.468
I told you. I went home.

01:26:52.633 --> 01:26:54.631
Right, but first, you...

01:26:54.767 --> 01:26:56.804
you followed her, right?

01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:59.345
Yeah. I mean, she was wasted.

01:27:00.708 --> 01:27:02.711
Oh, no. So you felt angry

01:27:02.846 --> 01:27:04.874
and, I don't know,
sick of being played?

01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.353
No, no, that wasn't it. Okay?

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:10.490
It's just how Kenny was.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:12.656
She'd get all worked up,
you know, talk this big game,

01:27:12.791 --> 01:27:15.392
and the next day,
it'd be like nothing happened.

01:27:15.528 --> 01:27:17.088
So she just needed
to chill out.

01:27:18.161 --> 01:27:19.189
Right.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.598
Yes, okay, I...

01:27:23.096 --> 01:27:26.240
I know our relationship
wasn't perfect.

01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:29.639
But we did love each other.

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:34.445
Now, listen, lady...

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:37.048
I've done a lot of things
in my life

01:27:37.183 --> 01:27:38.318
that I'm not proud of.

01:27:40.351 --> 01:27:42.751
But I didn't do this.

01:27:47.094 --> 01:27:48.218
The biggest regret...

01:27:49.997 --> 01:27:51.089
of my life...

01:27:53.091 --> 01:27:54.362
is that I didn't
go after Kendall

01:27:54.497 --> 01:27:55.731
in my car that night.

01:27:57.665 --> 01:27:58.701
Because if I did...

01:28:00.603 --> 01:28:02.034
Kenny would still be alive.

01:28:05.374 --> 01:28:06.236
I'm done.

01:28:08.707 --> 01:28:09.712
[bangs door]

01:28:19.092 --> 01:28:20.118
[door closes]

01:28:22.158 --> 01:28:23.957
[bailiff] All right, everybody,
on the bus. Let's go.

01:28:27.462 --> 01:28:28.467
[laughing]

01:28:37.605 --> 01:28:39.005
[Courtney laughs]

01:28:41.674 --> 01:28:43.273
[snoring]

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.535
Ah. Look, but don't touch.

01:29:04.565 --> 01:29:05.603
Put it back.

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.141
[country music playing
on speakers]

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:07.691
[bailiff] <i>Okay, y'all.
You ready to go?</i>

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:09.898
[music fades]

01:30:31.357 --> 01:30:33.317
[tense music playing]

01:30:40.093 --> 01:30:42.161
So this is where they fought.

01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:47.996
Hey, you all right?

01:31:49.336 --> 01:31:50.735
Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.

01:31:51.369 --> 01:31:52.363
Nah, man.

01:31:54.137 --> 01:31:55.839
You haven't been fine
since the start.

01:31:58.273 --> 01:32:00.305
I think you've been playing us
this whole time.

01:32:01.778 --> 01:32:02.714
I don't know what you mean.

01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.850
The day you got
on the jury, you were...

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:10.988
puking in the bathroom.

01:32:11.124 --> 01:32:13.725
All that stuff
with the Flower Man cop
and those papers.

01:32:15.927 --> 01:32:17.020
You claim to be
the voice of reason,

01:32:17.156 --> 01:32:18.794
but you're really just...

01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:20.228
telling us
what we want to hear.

01:32:20.364 --> 01:32:21.865
[clinks]

01:32:29.206 --> 01:32:30.603
Now, I don't know
what game you're playing, man,

01:32:30.739 --> 01:32:31.842
but I see you.

01:32:35.476 --> 01:32:37.949
Do I know exactly
what happened that night?

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:39.514
No.

01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:41.621
But neither do you.

01:32:43.084 --> 01:32:45.457
And you can't be any more sure

01:32:45.592 --> 01:32:47.958
that James Sythe got in his car

01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:51.026
and drove home that night
than I'm sure he...

01:32:52.862 --> 01:32:54.600
picked up one of these rocks

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.570
and bashed
that poor girl's head in.

01:32:58.233 --> 01:32:59.738
And threw her body
in the creek.

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.274
Jesus, man.

01:33:08.409 --> 01:33:10.540
- You nearly slipped.
- Yeah. [clears throat]

01:33:15.753 --> 01:33:18.218
Maybe that hiker was right.

01:33:18.353 --> 01:33:20.627
- Could have slipped.
- Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

01:33:21.989 --> 01:33:23.124
But it doesn't matter.

01:33:26.725 --> 01:33:29.460
That piece of shit
left her there that night...

01:33:30.436 --> 01:33:32.566
alone, to die.

01:33:32.701 --> 01:33:33.904
In a ditch.

01:33:36.201 --> 01:33:37.843
Her death is on him.

01:33:37.978 --> 01:33:40.647
Which is why I will never
acquit James Sythe.

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.946
Ever.

01:33:47.215 --> 01:33:48.686
This trial ends
in only two ways,

01:33:48.822 --> 01:33:51.620
either with a conviction
or a hung jury.

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:52.954
[Denice claps] All right.

01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:54.518
Is everybody ready
to head home?

01:33:56.993 --> 01:33:58.588
Is everybody done here, please?

01:34:00.466 --> 01:34:01.426
[Marcus] Yeah.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.168
Okay, let's go.

01:34:10.545 --> 01:34:11.744
[Denice] Have you seen enough?

01:34:12.608 --> 01:34:13.574
Yeah.

01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:15.781
[engines start]

01:34:24.459 --> 01:34:27.452
[suspenseful music playing]

01:34:28.823 --> 01:34:30.323
[engine starts]

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:34.162
[country music playing
on speakers]

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:02.355
[sighs]

01:35:18.103 --> 01:35:19.145
[banging]

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.307
All rise!

01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:42.065
Madam Foreperson.

01:35:45.431 --> 01:35:47.037
Has the jury reached a verdict?

01:35:47.869 --> 01:35:49.574
Yes, Your Honor.

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.778
And is that verdict unanimous?

01:35:52.577 --> 01:35:53.703
Yes, Your Honor.

01:36:21.034 --> 01:36:23.810
Will the defendant please stand
for the reading of the verdict?

01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:34.619
"In the matter
of the <i>State of Georgia
vs. James Michael Sythe,</i>

01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:39.683
case number C-R-20211715532,

01:36:40.955 --> 01:36:42.521
we, the jury

01:36:42.656 --> 01:36:45.291
find the defendant,
James Michael Sythe

01:36:45.426 --> 01:36:47.999
guilty of count one
malice murder.

01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:51.262
Signed and dated this day,

01:36:51.398 --> 01:36:54.172
Denice Aldworth, Foreperson."

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.605
[sighs]

01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:56.843
Madam Foreperson?

01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:59.274
To the best of your knowledge,

01:36:59.409 --> 01:37:01.671
was this your verdict
in the jury room?

01:37:01.806 --> 01:37:04.276
Was it freely
and voluntarily given?

01:37:04.411 --> 01:37:05.819
And is this still your verdict?

01:37:07.083 --> 01:37:08.619
[Denice] Yes, Your Honor.

01:37:08.755 --> 01:37:10.020
[Judge Thelma] Very well.

01:37:10.155 --> 01:37:11.986
Then the defendant
is hereby remanded

01:37:12.121 --> 01:37:14.694
to the custody of the State.

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.995
Sentencing will be
at a later date.

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:23.331
[softly] Oh, James.

01:37:27.598 --> 01:37:29.672
Thank you for your service.

01:37:29.808 --> 01:37:30.976
It is now concluded.

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:33.770
This court is adjourned.

01:37:41.850 --> 01:37:43.021
[sighs]

01:38:19.823 --> 01:38:20.850
[groans softly]

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:29.232
[sirens blaring in distance]

01:38:33.168 --> 01:38:35.271
[tense music playing]

01:38:51.216 --> 01:38:52.585
[sighs]

01:39:02.263 --> 01:39:04.432
Hey. Good. Right there.

01:39:06.201 --> 01:39:07.899
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:39:08.035 --> 01:39:09.398
- What time does it start?
- Soon. I'm going to head out.

01:39:09.534 --> 01:39:10.669
You sure you want to go?

01:39:11.369 --> 01:39:12.468
Hey! Justin.

01:39:12.603 --> 01:39:14.480
He wasn't a good guy.

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:15.905
It's not your fault.

01:39:18.214 --> 01:39:19.414
I didn't stand up for him.

01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:22.985
I told them what they
needed to hear,

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.386
and said he couldn't change.

01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:27.653
And I have
to live with that, so...

01:39:31.525 --> 01:39:32.460
The least I can do is be there.

01:39:34.899 --> 01:39:35.969
[door closes]

01:39:38.231 --> 01:39:39.467
Hi, peanut.

01:39:54.314 --> 01:39:55.219
This came for you.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.387
Will the defendant
please stand for sentencing?

01:40:35.287 --> 01:40:40.891
The murder of Kendall Carter
was violent and senseless.

01:40:41.027 --> 01:40:43.664
The jury has found you
guilty of that murder,

01:40:43.799 --> 01:40:46.864
for which this court
sentences you as follows.

01:40:47.842 --> 01:40:50.175
Count one, malice murder.

01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:53.176
Life in prison

01:40:53.311 --> 01:40:55.180
without the possibility
of parole.

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:59.082
The defendant
is hereby remanded

01:40:59.218 --> 01:41:00.911
to the Department
of Corrections

01:41:01.046 --> 01:41:03.188
to serve the rest
of his life in prison.

01:41:25.506 --> 01:41:28.104
[suspenseful music playing]

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.776
[Allison] <i>My husband,
Justin, hit a deer.</i>

01:41:29.911 --> 01:41:31.381
[Justin] <i>My wife is of
a high-risk pregnancy.</i>

01:41:45.498 --> 01:41:47.265
[Judge Thelma] This court
is now adjourned.

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:09.650
Hey.

01:42:11.388 --> 01:42:12.917
I'm surprised you came today.

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.625
I wanted to see this through.

01:42:18.425 --> 01:42:19.528
Yeah. Me too.

01:42:24.903 --> 01:42:25.963
You look tired.

01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:29.472
Likewise.

01:42:30.904 --> 01:42:32.277
Well, I have
a new baby at home.

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.642
That's not what I meant.

01:42:42.081 --> 01:42:43.519
Congratulations on winning
your election.

01:42:43.654 --> 01:42:45.591
- I saw it in the paper.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:47.450
It's a pretty big deal.
You must have
worked hard for it.

01:42:47.585 --> 01:42:48.590
Oh, I did.

01:42:50.929 --> 01:42:53.166
There's a lot of good
you can do in that job,
I'd imagine.

01:42:54.328 --> 01:42:55.399
Sometimes.

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.996
It's not as easy
as you think, though.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:02.164
Never is.

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.505
Mmm. Sometimes you try
and do the right thing

01:43:04.641 --> 01:43:06.245
only to realize
you got it all wrong.

01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:14.177
And when you figure things out,

01:43:14.312 --> 01:43:16.354
you realize the guy
you're after isn't some...

01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:19.014
psycho.

01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:20.688
He's not even
really a criminal.

01:43:22.622 --> 01:43:24.296
He's just a regular guy.

01:43:28.332 --> 01:43:29.691
What if it was an accident?

01:43:29.827 --> 01:43:30.962
This is no accident.

01:43:34.507 --> 01:43:36.737
It's impossible to prove,
either way.

01:43:36.872 --> 01:43:38.970
Just like him
not realizing at the time

01:43:39.105 --> 01:43:40.840
that he hit someone
with his car. It's...

01:43:44.546 --> 01:43:45.812
You just have to trust him.

01:43:47.812 --> 01:43:48.914
Why would I do that?

01:43:50.222 --> 01:43:52.489
Because he's a good person.

01:43:52.624 --> 01:43:54.919
He was caught
in terrible circumstances.

01:43:55.055 --> 01:43:57.457
Mmm-hmm. No, you're right.
This is a...

01:43:57.592 --> 01:43:58.924
[chuckles] It's a tough one.

01:44:01.565 --> 01:44:03.027
He has a family
depending on him,

01:44:03.163 --> 01:44:04.897
just like you have people
depending on you.

01:44:06.204 --> 01:44:07.537
And what about justice?

01:44:13.881 --> 01:44:15.539
Well, sometimes...

01:44:15.675 --> 01:44:17.908
the truth isn't justice.

01:44:18.044 --> 01:44:20.451
[scoffs] You really
believe that?

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.356
If you keep going with this,

01:44:28.492 --> 01:44:30.624
the press will eat you alive.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.698
Okay? This case
will follow you forever.

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.089
In the meantime,

01:44:34.225 --> 01:44:36.366
some politician
will take your job,

01:44:36.502 --> 01:44:38.468
a criminal goes back
on the street,

01:44:38.603 --> 01:44:40.768
and a good man
and his family will be...

01:44:42.238 --> 01:44:43.606
just destroyed.

01:44:46.741 --> 01:44:48.941
Where is the justice in that?

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:11.128
[melancholy music playing]

01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:23.844
Amen.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.468
Looks like the storm passed.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.196
Yeah. I think so.

01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:54.347
[engine starts]

01:46:10.398 --> 01:46:12.530
[Eric] Hello?
Where's our new DA?

01:46:13.991 --> 01:46:16.059
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:46:16.194 --> 01:46:18.060
- For the new digs.
- Oh. [chuckles]

01:46:18.195 --> 01:46:20.369
- Thanks.
- Yeah. It's real.

01:46:20.504 --> 01:46:22.375
Easy plant to take care of.

01:46:23.973 --> 01:46:26.704
- It really thrives on neglect.
- [chuckles]

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.909
- You did it.
- [sighs]

01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:32.011
I hope it was worth it.

01:46:36.881 --> 01:46:37.856
[knocks on table]

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:39.583
Ale House later.

01:46:39.719 --> 01:46:40.690
You're buying.

01:47:03.741 --> 01:47:05.914
Kung fu!

01:47:06.049 --> 01:47:09.084
- Hi.
- And the 4Runner
is officially sold.

01:47:09.219 --> 01:47:10.049
Okay.

01:47:11.749 --> 01:47:12.755
[sighs]

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.592
Come here.

01:47:18.362 --> 01:47:19.832
[baby cooing]

01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:20.933
[both gasp]

01:47:21.068 --> 01:47:22.061
- Hi.
- Oh.

01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:25.136
Good morning. Dada.

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:26.570
[Justin and Allison] Yeah.

01:47:26.705 --> 01:47:28.571
- There she goes.
- Come here. Here we go.

01:47:28.707 --> 01:47:31.674
Yeah. Yeah.
You're doing good. Hi.

01:47:31.810 --> 01:47:34.738
[sighs] It sucks.
I think she has my eyes.

01:47:34.873 --> 01:47:36.047
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:47:36.182 --> 01:47:38.042
- No.
- Yeah.

01:47:38.178 --> 01:47:39.650
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Well...

01:47:40.716 --> 01:47:42.154
Look, I think, maybe mine.

01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.486
They're changing a little bit.

01:47:43.621 --> 01:47:46.248
- [baby cooing]
- Yeah, hi.

01:47:46.383 --> 01:47:48.157
- She has my mouth.
- I hope not.

01:47:48.292 --> 01:47:50.089
[both laugh]

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:52.657
Definitely your elbows, though.

01:47:52.792 --> 01:47:53.966
My elb-- [laughs]

01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:55.732
My elbow. [gasps]

01:47:55.867 --> 01:47:57.930
Look at your beautiful elbows.
You're blessed.

01:47:58.066 --> 01:48:00.000
- [laughs]
- My greatest feature.

01:48:03.471 --> 01:48:04.477
Hi.

01:48:06.607 --> 01:48:07.808
My girls.

01:48:07.944 --> 01:48:10.379
My girls
with beautiful elbows. Yeah.

01:48:10.515 --> 01:48:12.375
- [knock at door]
- Oh.

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.310
Oh.

01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:16.178
Who could that be
at a time like this?

01:48:16.314 --> 01:48:17.516
- Hey, peanut.
- There we go.

01:48:17.651 --> 01:48:18.854
Hi, honey.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.856
Okay.

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:42.306
