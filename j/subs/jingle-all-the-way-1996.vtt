01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.881
and the bus..

01:24:13.965 --> 01:24:16.633
and, uh, the bomb.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:20.470
I had it! I had it!
I had it right here in my hands!

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.556
What am I gonna tell my son
on Christmas morning?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.560
- How am I gonna look him in the eye? How?
- Wait.

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:29.313
- Did you see? I had it, man. I was so close.
- Wait.

01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.150
Merry Christmas.

01:24:34.485 --> 01:24:38.322
- Wow. Wow.
- But—

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:41.700
Hey, thank— thank you.
Thank you.

01:24:41.784 --> 01:24:44.661
You know, this is gonna
make my son really happy.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:47.331
I'm sorry about that, uh,
little tension we had on the roof.

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:49.875
Hey, it's cool.

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:54.296
But, Jamie, I thought you wanted
this doll more than anything.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:58.342
What do I need the doll for?
I got the real Turbo Man at home.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.928
- Oh!
- [Crowd] Turbo Man!

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:03.138
That-That's my husband.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.849

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:42.427
- [Liz] Hey!
- Yeah, look at that. There it is.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.429
- Voilà!

01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:48.267

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:52.604
Howard, I've been thinking.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:54.648
Everything that you
went through today for Jamie...

01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:56.733
really shows
how much you love him.

01:25:56.818 --> 01:26:01.113
And, uh— And if you’re willing to go
through all of that for him...

01:26:01.197 --> 01:26:03.532
just for a present...

01:26:03.616 --> 01:26:05.534
well, that makes me wonder.

01:26:05.618 --> 01:26:07.744
