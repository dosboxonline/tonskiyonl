04:04.994 --> 04:07.120
Just because he brought
John Woo to Hollywood ...

04:07.121 --> 04:10.916
doesn't mean he can
rub my dick with sandpaper.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.880
He still thinks we're
making Citizen Kane?

04:19.466 --> 04:24.888
Not using a gun symbolizes the
whole purity of the character.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.187
The Purity ...

07:00.211 --> 07:03.380
See the Arab in the film?
See that beard?

07:03.381 --> 07:06.883
Ever seen one like
that on a plane or a bus?

07:06.884 --> 07:08.844
You think I look like him?

07:10.805 --> 07:12.305
The movie's from 1986.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.641
Haven't you ever had an idea
just to realize ...

07:14.642 --> 07:17.144
you've seen it before?

07:17.145 --> 07:21.273
Chuck Norris giving Bin Laden
the idea of 9-11, that's bull!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.733
But Chuck Norris
works for the C.I.A.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.569
Yesterday it was
Schwarzenegger.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.364
Seen how the Arabs in True Lies
get all excited like hyenas?

07:29.365 --> 07:31.283
Action films need bad guys.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.451
Exactly!

07:32.452 --> 07:35.287
In the '70s, it was the Viets,
now the Arabs.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.791
Stallone in Rambo 3, Hauer
in Wanted: Dead or Alive.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.668
Bruce Willis in The Siege.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.670
Steven Seagal in
Executive Decision?

07:43.671 --> 07:44.963
And what's his name?

07:44.964 --> 07:47.466
Mark Wahlberg
who fights in Iraq?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.010
- Jean-Claude Van Damme!
- He never hit Arabs.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.845
Dummy, Van Damme's outside!

07:51.846 --> 07:53.180
Hey, Mr. Van Damme!

07:53.181 --> 07:55.265
Wait, I'm a great fan
of yours!

07:55.266 --> 07:57.559
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.311
What's this?
"Lost in Schaerbeek"?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.604
Going to the post office.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.397
A quick snap
for the store?

08:02.398 --> 08:03.607
Thanks, sir!

08:03.608 --> 08:04.941
Look, Jean-Claude Van Damme!

08:04.942 --> 08:06.109
Hello!

08:06.110 --> 08:08.278
Don't "hello" him,
just take the picture.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.492
Your turn now.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.118
Jean-Claude Van Damme!

08:19.248 --> 08:21.708
Wait, my grandma
adores you, too ...

08:21.709 --> 08:23.585
In five minutes.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.045
Thanks, sir.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.130
Wow!
It was Jean-Claude Van Damme!

08:27.131 --> 08:28.423
He's cool!

08:28.424 --> 08:30.759
I pictured him taller,
but he's short.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.845
He's cool!
Classy and all!

08:33.846 --> 08:35.347
He's all tanned.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.015
He'll be right back.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.101
- He cured cancer or what?
- Why, did you?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.727
No, but nobody kisses my ass.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.063
He's a star!

08:43.063 --> 08:44.856
He left this shit hole
for Hollywood.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.942
He fought to be
where he is now.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.443
You've never left town!

08:48.444 --> 08:51.863
Whether you're a star or a dog,
I don't care.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.032
Then why are you
waiting for him?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.700
You can't park here!

08:55.701 --> 08:59.162
He's just a regular guy.
Back off. watch my car!

09:00.873 --> 09:02.249
Calm down, ma'am!

09:02.250 --> 09:05.544
Move back, I don't
wanna see you around here!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.837
- Help me, sir.
- You can't park here.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.674
- Only ten minutes!
- She's waiting for her idol.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.758
Who's the idol?

09:11.759 --> 09:12.759
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.760
Who?

09:13.761 --> 09:14.886
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.388
Get outta here!

09:16.389 --> 09:17.973
"Aware!"

09:17.974 --> 09:20.308
Look, we have pictures.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.393
How is he?

09:21.394 --> 09:22.686
He's nice.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.854
He's just a regular guy, sir.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.357
I don't think so,
the guy's a star.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.360
He left this shit hole
for Hollywood.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.445
He fought to
get where he is now.

09:32.446 --> 09:35.282
You've never even left town!

09:35.283 --> 09:39.411
So what?
Bunch of ass-kissers.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.745
What'd you say?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.080
I was talking to them.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.290
Help me!

09:43.291 --> 09:45.375
I was talking to them,
I swear!

09:45.376 --> 09:47.127
Plain, old flat to me.
Registration, please.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.212
- Oh, come on!
- Registration!

09:49.213 --> 09:50.755
Don't ruin my day, please!

09:50.756 --> 09:52.382
Registration!

09:52.383 --> 09:55.802
I always get this crap, thanks.

09:55.803 --> 09:56.803
Anytime!

09:56.804 --> 09:58.555
You owe me big time!

10:02.018 --> 10:03.852
Shut up!

10:09.609 --> 10:11.401
For once, it's not my fault!

10:11.402 --> 10:13.069
Please, ma'am, shut up!

10:18.326 --> 10:19.826
Stop now.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.628
Don't stay here!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.671
Get lost!

10:31.672 --> 10:35.216
You heard me!

10:35.217 --> 10:36.593
Shit ...

10:46.312 --> 10:48.605
Open!
What's going on in there?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.315
What's going on?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.711
On the ground!
On the ground!

12:09.478 --> 12:11.020
Central to Unit 27.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.981
Jean-Claude Van Damme's
robbing a post office.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.483
I need backup.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.235
Possible hostage situation.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.821
I repeat: possible
hostage situation.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.993
1. The Answer
before the Question.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.292
He's in court for
his daughter's custody,

12:32.293 --> 12:35.712
and he can't approach
his ex-wife.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.298
He picked up!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.099
Please, move, convince ...
Perfect.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.101
Mr. Van Damme?

12:55.357 --> 12:57.317
This is Commissioner Bruges.

12:57.318 --> 13:01.029
How are things inside?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.822
It could be better.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.618
Okay, let me ask you first,
is anyone injured?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.664
Hello?
Jean-Claude?

13:11.665 --> 13:16.795
No, no, a man's unconscious
and bleeding.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.839
Jean-Claude —
may I call you Jean-Claude?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
I'm Commissioner
Christian Bruges.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.010
Call me Christian.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.679
You have to release
the wounded man.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.765
It's not in your interest,
nor mine,

13:28.766 --> 13:31.100
to have blood on our hands.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.656
Will you release him?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.534
No, no one leaves,
it's impossible.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.500
What if I came with a doctor?

13:55.501 --> 13:56.835
Hello?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.670
Jean-Claude?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.839
What if I came with a doctor?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.382
Fine, but unarmed.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.259
I give you my word.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.718
Commissioner Bruges?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.762
Call me a doc, please!

14:07.763 --> 14:10.056
Lieutenant Perthier,
SWAT team.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.058
I just spoke with Van Damme.

14:12.059 --> 14:16.229
So, I'm going inside and then
we'll debrief, if necessary.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.315
- I'd like to deploy my men.
- No, it's too soon.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.609
Could I borrow you a vest?

14:21.610 --> 14:22.902
I'll give it back.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.237
Jackie.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.114
A doctor, please.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.535
I asked for a doc!

14:30.536 --> 14:31.870
Get me a doc!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.413
Eric went to Med school.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.789
Okay, let's go.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.999
Boss!

14:40.629 --> 14:42.005
Hello?

14:42.006 --> 14:43.339
Jean-Claude?

14:43.340 --> 14:45.174
No!

14:45.175 --> 14:46.926
You have my word that —

14:49.597 --> 14:52.140
Jean-Claude,
we're here to find —

14:59.189 --> 15:00.523
What?

15:37.353 --> 15:38.978
We see the chief of police

15:38.979 --> 15:41.648
exiting the video store,
crisis unit H.Q.,

15:41.649 --> 15:45.735
and going towards the post
office in his boxer shorts.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.988
Is Van Damme trying to
mock the police?

15:48.989 --> 15:52.742
In any case,
it seems to be working,

15:52.743 --> 15:55.828
as the public is
rooting for him,

15:55.829 --> 15:58.414
in spite of today's events.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.959
The shorts!
The shorts!

16:00.960 --> 16:04.921
The shorts ...

16:42.710 --> 16:44.711
Don't shoot, I'm a hostage!

17:13.866 --> 17:15.532
Drop the kit.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.788
Slide it over.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.585
Check the kit.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.064
Go to the back room.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.906
Hurry, he's bleeding!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.241
No tricks, Jean-Claude.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.043
Van Damme's fame
has driven them here.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.837
They're clearly fans,
here to support him,

18:09.838 --> 18:12.799
and the slightest move
gets the crowd on fire,

18:12.800 --> 18:16.010
yelling out his name.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.804
We've heard
a few snide remarks,

18:17.805 --> 18:20.515
like the one about
the Commissioner,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.433
who went out in his shorts.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.310
But the situation
is dramatic ...

18:27.815 --> 18:30.441
Sir, don't move.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.778
What am I doing here?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.030
What's going on?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.824
Calm down, sir.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.910
- Don't move.
- It hurts.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.329
What the fuck —

18:43.330 --> 18:45.164
No, Jean-Claude, no!

19:01.056 --> 19:03.266
Don't move!
Get outta here!

19:03.267 --> 19:05.601
Calm down, Jean-Claude!

19:05.602 --> 19:07.562
Get outta here!

19:11.441 --> 19:13.901
The curtain, help them!

19:25.122 --> 19:26.372
Right on.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.623
Gimme five!

19:27.624 --> 19:29.417
Awesome.
How did you do that?

19:29.418 --> 19:30.710
Seriously, what a pro!

19:30.711 --> 19:33.296
- What's this?
- See what he did?

19:33.297 --> 19:35.590
This isn't a movie,
what do I care?

19:35.591 --> 19:38.676
Take him with
the others, fast!

19:38.677 --> 19:40.636
Listen, smart-ass,

19:40.637 --> 19:44.056
you better think of something
or I'll shoot ...

19:44.057 --> 19:46.058
How do you do it, Jean-Claude?

19:46.059 --> 19:49.604
You got him in the balls
with your foot and your hand!

19:49.605 --> 19:53.107
You're too fast for me,
I swear.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.652
Sit down, you deserve it.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.550
Hey.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.053
Can't you see
he saved his life?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.347
He saved all of us.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.141
Jean-Claude,
he's still out cold!

20:27.142 --> 20:29.435
What a fag.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.398
Find a way
to get us outta here,

20:34.399 --> 20:37.276
or I'll shoot one per hour,
starting with our hero.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.403
They're clueless.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.322
We can ask anything ...

20:43.575 --> 20:46.160
like a ransom
with him as hostage.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.828
Let's ask for a million!

20:47.829 --> 20:48.913
A million?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.706
Where do you see a million?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.792
Have you ever even
seen a million?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.795
Where are you?
In a post office!

20:55.796 --> 20:56.837
He's a star!

20:56.838 --> 20:58.422
I mean, it's Van Damme!

20:58.423 --> 21:00.841
They expect more than a mil.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.390
We leave with him
and the cash.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.851
So the hostages can go to
the cops once we're out.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.526
Talking about a brain ...

21:18.527 --> 21:21.696
You almost
got me killed!

21:21.697 --> 21:23.698
- You realize?
- Listen ...

21:23.699 --> 21:24.991
I'd be dead!

21:24.992 --> 21:26.409
You're not the F.B.I.!

21:26.410 --> 21:27.785
I'm still the boss.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.578
Go to Hollywood for drama!

21:29.579 --> 21:30.871
I work here!

21:30.872 --> 21:32.665
Fuck your
action men in black!

21:32.666 --> 21:34.417
They're no better than us.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.335
Let's just shoot him.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.463
That's not our job,
we're here to save lives!

21:39.464 --> 21:41.590
So maybe that's
what it takes!

21:41.591 --> 21:43.217
This isn't a war!

21:43.218 --> 21:45.511
You're telling me
how to do my job?

21:45.512 --> 21:47.638
Can't you just shut up?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.181
The gendarmes
are gonna show up.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.809
Get lost.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.227
Yeah, get outta here.

21:59.526 --> 22:03.404
What are you laughing at?

22:04.156 --> 22:06.907
And the kid?

22:06.908 --> 22:09.160
The kid ...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.787
we take him with us.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.748
Know anyone that would
want to have ...

22:13.749 --> 22:16.500
a dead kid
on their conscience?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.252
Yes.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.848
Boss!

22:34.227 --> 22:36.520
- The blood ...
- Yes, Jean-Claude?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.397
It's because of your crap.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.983
No, I have nothing
to do with this.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.985
The SWAT team decided alone ...

22:42.986 --> 22:44.653
I swear,
I wouldn't have —

22:44.654 --> 22:47.198
- I have a list of demands.
- Yes.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.659
You have to do something
about the kid first.

22:50.660 --> 22:54.163
The kid,
you have to release him.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.248
Negative.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.834
- You have enough hostages.
- Cut the crap!

22:58.835 --> 23:00.628
You want the list or not?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.004
Yes, I'm listening.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.298
You have enough hostages.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.801
Okay, I want a million euros
in small bills.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.804
Unmarked, with
different serial numbers.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.599
I want a bus for the airport,
a jet with a full tank.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.894
Destination to be
confirmed once I'm on-board.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.939
Then I'll release the hostages.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.483
You're asking a lot,
Jean-Claude.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.860
Honestly, you realize that ...

23:30.242 --> 23:32.159
- It won't work.
- What?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.869
I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.622
It makes no sense,
it's all bullshit.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.541
It should be less realistic.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.543
Like what?

23:40.544 --> 23:42.753
Wait, I have an idea.

23:42.754 --> 23:48.134
I'll also need $465,000 ...

23:48.135 --> 23:49.301
Yeah.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.011
... to be delivered by noon,

23:51.012 --> 23:55.391
to the firm Bernstein,
Katz, and Phillis —

23:59.062 --> 24:01.105
He hung up.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.815
What's that?
A code?

24:02.816 --> 24:04.150
No, it makes more sense.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.443
Who are those guys?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.028
- My attorneys in L.A.
- Don't mess with me.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.864
Dumb-ass.
He's in court for the custody —

24:09.865 --> 24:12.658
Shut up!
You leave them all alone!

24:13.994 --> 24:15.786
- Change the tone.
- Shut up.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.872
- Watch it, okay?
- Go back.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.165
I'm not your baby brother.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.624
Go.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.877
Look, Carradine,
I'll go when I'm ready.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.420
Go back, your idol's coming.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.338
Ass-kisser, get lost!

24:26.339 --> 24:29.049
I'm staying.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.718
Now, I'm going.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.136
Okay, then go!

24:32.137 --> 24:34.930
He's right, a movie star
asking for a million ...

24:34.931 --> 24:36.390
it's ridiculous.

24:36.391 --> 24:39.685
But a star asking for money
to pay his law fees ...

24:39.686 --> 24:41.645
sounds desperate.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.815
Not bad,
not bad at all.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.275
Go back with the others.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.444
I said, beat it!

24:59.831 --> 25:02.541
Look at those idiots.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.462
So: 1 + 1 = 1.
It's still you.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.464
- It's love.
- 2 in 1.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.092
But for us:
1 + 1 = 2 and 2 + 2 = 4.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.552
Then we're "selfish."

25:13.553 --> 25:16.013
We take money
without sharing it.

25:16.014 --> 25:20.476
But if 1 + 1 = 1 ...
Or maybe 1 + 1 = 11.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.019
That's beautiful!

25:22.020 --> 25:24.563
I just got back from
Belgium today.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.398
I was at my mother's, and ...

25:26.399 --> 25:28.692
What was the name he said,
in English?

25:28.693 --> 25:30.903
- Bernstein.
- What?

25:30.904 --> 25:33.364
Leon Bernstein.

25:36.618 --> 25:40.663
We don't think horizontal,
we think vertical.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.373
We stand straight in life.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.334
We don't think in hours
and in seconds, it's "neutral."

25:45.335 --> 25:48.587
The snake, Adam and Eve,
I don't buy it anymore.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.047
A snake is nice.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.800
An apple's good,
it contains pectin.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.135
It's good for cholesterol.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.304
Can an apple hurt a woman?

25:57.305 --> 25:59.848
Some people failed,

25:59.849 --> 26:03.352
because they're not "aware."

26:03.353 --> 26:07.523
They don't acknowledge
that they exist.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.525
Poor things,
they don't know.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.986
So I'm "aware," I'm awake.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.362
What's "aware"?

26:13.363 --> 26:16.240
You wake up, wondering
what you're doing ...

26:16.241 --> 26:18.701
No, it's fine.

26:18.702 --> 26:22.454
Dolphins use wavelengths too,
they're smart in the sea.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.206
We live in the earth.

26:24.207 --> 26:31.213
They communicate, since they
don't blah-blah-blah ...

32:18.227 --> 32:20.312
Hey, I'm a great fan of yours!

32:20.313 --> 32:22.898
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.441
What's this,
"Lost in Schaerbeek"?

32:24.442 --> 32:25.776
Going to the post office.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.945
A quick snap for the store?

32:27.946 --> 32:30.072
Thanks, sir!
Look, it's Van Damme!

32:30.073 --> 32:32.991
Don't "hello" him,
take the picture first.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.126
Thanks, guys.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.671
Wait, my grandma
adores you, too!

32:45.672 --> 32:47.756
I'll be back in five minutes.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.854
Name's Van Damme.
How's it going?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.230
Hello.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.315
Can I come in?
I have a —

33:47.316 --> 33:49.985
No, no, you can't,
we're closed.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.445
- Closed?
- Yes.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.864
But it's not six yet.

33:54.907 --> 33:59.202
Please, it's very important.
I'm expecting a transfer.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.955
Yes, but we can't ...

34:01.956 --> 34:03.415
No, seriously!

34:03.416 --> 34:04.750
A computer problem.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.419
Seriously?
This can't be.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.420
No, it's important,
I have to ...

34:09.422 --> 34:10.922
Tomorrow, we'll let you in.

34:10.922 --> 34:15.092
No, I need to go in today.
Listen, it's very important.

34:15.094 --> 34:19.723
I need this money for my family
here, you understand?

34:19.724 --> 34:21.641
Let me speak to the boss.

34:21.641 --> 34:25.145
- Quickly, then.
- It'll take a sec, thanks.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.246
Hello, ma'am,
how are you?

34:43.246 --> 34:45.290
I'm here for a transfer.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.043
The name's
Jean-Claude Van Varenberg.

34:48.043 --> 34:51.004
Not my stage name, Van Damme.

34:51.964 --> 34:55.007
I'm sorry,
but we're out of cash today.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.302
I told you, Mr. Van Damme.

34:57.303 --> 35:00.055
No, you told me
it was a computer problem.

35:00.056 --> 35:03.225
Is it a cash or a
computer problem?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.143
You pick.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.856
Listen, please,
give me my money.

35:09.857 --> 35:13.110
I have no money,
my credit cards don't work.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.403
Nothing works.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.156
We're out of cash.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.741
It's impossible.

35:19.742 --> 35:22.285
This is a bank!
It's only 11, noon?

35:22.286 --> 35:25.789
I'm broke, I have no money,
and my cards don't work!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.207
C'mon, sir.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.210
Wait, what's your name?

35:30.211 --> 35:31.253
Arthur.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.922
Listen, I haven't slept
in two days,

35:33.923 --> 35:37.050
jet lag,
the Los Angeles court,

35:37.051 --> 35:38.927
the planes, a toy store,

35:38.928 --> 35:43.140
my mom on the phone,
the cab, the tip —

35:43.141 --> 35:44.933
Wait, I have an idea.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.060
I have a solution.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.062
Then, collect some money.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.857
I'm a good client here,
I'm pretty loaded.

35:51.858 --> 35:56.319
Why don't you ask people here
for $700 or even $650?

35:56.320 --> 35:59.573
And tomorrow take it
out of my bank account.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.450
But I can't.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.205
- You don't give a shit, huh?
- No, I just can't.

36:10.209 --> 36:13.336
I want my fucking money!

36:13.337 --> 36:16.214
I'm sick of this,
I want my money!

36:16.215 --> 36:18.175
It's like this since yesterday!

36:18.176 --> 36:21.636
I have no cash on me,
Van Damme without cash!

36:21.637 --> 36:23.013
Gimme a loan.

36:23.014 --> 36:26.308
Hey, I haven't slept.
I got on a plane ...

36:26.309 --> 36:30.353
I just got back from
a child-custody thing.

36:31.063 --> 36:33.398
Look, I'm exhausted, guys.
Help me out here.

36:33.399 --> 36:36.568
First the cab,
then the toys ...

36:36.569 --> 36:38.403
Please, help me!

36:38.404 --> 36:41.573
- Okay, c'mon now.
- What? Where?

36:46.078 --> 36:49.831
Camera?

36:49.832 --> 36:51.541
Is this candid camera?

36:51.542 --> 36:54.127
Sorry, guys, sorry.

36:54.128 --> 36:58.006
Listen, I've had a bad day,
I haven't slept in two days.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.884
Cut this one,
it's a "bad take."

37:02.637 --> 37:04.221
Put him with the others!

37:04.222 --> 37:08.183
Are you nuts?
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme!

37:08.184 --> 37:11.686
C'mon, get up now!

37:11.687 --> 37:13.813
I said, get up!
Faster!

37:13.814 --> 37:17.067
Faster!
Move faster!

37:25.284 --> 37:27.702
Come and sit over here.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.959
Shit, what did he do to you?

37:33.960 --> 37:36.211
Breathe, breathe,
Jean-Claude.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.971
Wow! How do you develop
your triceps?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.097
I can't.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.265
Watch out!

38:07.868 --> 38:09.995
Get up! Get up!

38:09.996 --> 38:12.414
The curtain!

38:12.415 --> 38:14.833
- What?
- The curtain!

38:14.834 --> 38:18.003
Don't move! Shut up!
Lower your arms!

38:21.215 --> 38:24.009
You, too, shut up!
Lower your arms!

38:26.554 --> 38:28.555
Gimme a hand here!

38:28.556 --> 38:31.516
Gimme a hand, come!

38:36.814 --> 38:38.398
What's going on?

38:38.399 --> 38:41.151
Don't stay here!
Get lost!

38:45.031 --> 38:47.073
Open up!

38:50.870 --> 38:54.289
What's going on?

38:54.290 --> 38:56.791
Open up!

38:56.792 --> 38:58.209
Look down.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.211
You, too, look down.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.880
What are you
looking at?

39:01.881 --> 39:03.923
Look over there!

39:06.302 --> 39:07.761
Open up!

39:40.795 --> 39:42.587
What are you doing?

40:01.607 --> 40:02.857
Are you crazy?

40:02.858 --> 40:04.150
He was coming in.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.361
How are we gonna
get out now?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.404
He's gonna call backup.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.447
Maybe, but I'm not
turning myself in.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.408
I'm not in Belgium
to be jailbait.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.243
Watch it!

40:15.287 --> 40:17.163
Don't do that again.

40:17.164 --> 40:20.792
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

40:20.793 --> 40:25.046
- Shit, I almost shot him.
- Okay, sit down.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.052
Robbing a bank in Belgium
can't be that hard.

40:31.053 --> 40:34.055
Shit, what are
we gonna do now?

40:34.056 --> 40:38.017
Leave now,
while you still can.

40:38.018 --> 40:40.228
- He's right.
- Shut up!

40:41.439 --> 40:42.814
Turn yourselves in.

40:42.815 --> 40:46.609
In any case, we all saw
the gunshot was an accident.

40:46.610 --> 40:50.613
If I want some stretching
tips, I'll call you.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.990
Well done.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.159
You can insult me
all you want,

40:54.160 --> 40:56.035
or even hit a hostage,

40:56.036 --> 40:58.538
but I'm not
turning myself in.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.665
We gotta block the exits.

41:00.666 --> 41:03.501
Keep an eye on them
and cut the crap.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.880
You're saying that
a man broke in,

41:06.881 --> 41:10.049
and then you say
he got in with a key.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.011
We gotta be clear
on this one,

41:13.012 --> 41:16.973
otherwise,
it'll be a false statement.

41:16.974 --> 41:20.643
If you say he was drunk,
I won't know for sure ,,,

41:20.644 --> 41:23.646
until the alcohol
test has been done.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.523
It's as simple as that.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.650
Boss, guess who's
robbing the post office?

41:27.651 --> 41:29.486
Who?

41:29.487 --> 41:32.780
I liked how you pressured
the hostages earlier.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.741
It wasn't for them.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.951
You heard "Karate Kid,"
if we cooperate —

41:36.952 --> 41:39.037
Listen up, brainiac.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.456
Who said it was
a perfect plan,

41:41.457 --> 41:43.541
that post offices
are like the Red Cross,

41:43.542 --> 41:45.627
and that we'd catch
the 12:43 train?

41:45.628 --> 41:46.794
But the moron —

41:46.795 --> 41:49.297
The moron's your pal, not mine.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.925
So if you wanna be the boss ...

42:07.858 --> 42:11.069
If you wanna be the boss
and keep giving orders,

42:11.070 --> 42:13.404
you'd better start
growing some balls otherwise,

42:13.405 --> 42:14.822
I'm taking over.

42:14.823 --> 42:17.617
And I don't mind getting my
hands dirty.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.922
Commissioner, please.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.132
Hey, it's
Commissioner Bruges!

42:33.133 --> 42:35.260
Is Van Damme the perp?

42:35.261 --> 42:37.095
Wait. No declaration yet.

42:37.096 --> 42:39.472
Has anyone been shot?

42:39.473 --> 42:42.850
How many hostages
are held inside?

42:46.146 --> 42:48.356
- Enough.
- What's your plan?

42:48.357 --> 42:50.567
No, please!
Get him outta here!

42:54.780 --> 42:56.573
Be careful with the seats.

42:58.534 --> 43:02.662
Careful! You know how much
I can sell it for on eBay?

43:11.380 --> 43:14.299
No, nothing's moving.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.676
Can he turn that off?

43:16.677 --> 43:19.596
- The whining thing?
- The nerves.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.351
- Is that him?
- Yes.

43:25.352 --> 43:27.186
Did he dye his hair?

43:42.661 --> 43:44.621
He's in shock.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.332
- What?
- He's still in shock.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.043
Once in the film Hard Target,

43:50.044 --> 43:52.503
I took a shot from a blank.

43:52.504 --> 43:55.048
It took salts to reanimate me.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.884
Hard Target, John Woo.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.261
- What an ass.
- Don't say that.

44:00.262 --> 44:03.014
C'mon, Jean-Claude, wait a sec.

44:03.015 --> 44:05.308
He's the one who
brought him to the U.S.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.684
Without him,

44:06.685 --> 44:09.270
he'd still be filming
pigeons in Hong Kong.

44:09.271 --> 44:12.815
And then what?
He drops you.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.109
At least he did Face Off.

44:15.110 --> 44:18.404
So what?
He could have picked you!

44:18.405 --> 44:21.032
On the other hand,
when you see Windtalkers,

44:21.033 --> 44:23.951
there's a justice.

44:23.952 --> 44:25.953
Got any new projects?

44:25.954 --> 44:27.914
Not for now.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.833
I saw a thing on the web,
what's it called?

44:30.834 --> 44:34.754
Purple,
Purple Amulet.

44:36.674 --> 44:37.924
What about that?

44:37.925 --> 44:40.259
- Steven Seagal got the part.
- What?

44:40.260 --> 44:41.594
He got the part.

44:41.595 --> 44:42.887
Steven Seagal?

44:42.888 --> 44:44.847
You're ten times better.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.560
Well, he cut off
his couette.

44:49.561 --> 44:51.145
His what?

44:51.146 --> 44:53.648
His couette.

44:53.649 --> 44:56.317
His ponytail.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.860
For the first time.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.738
Oh, I see ...
That's a tough one.

45:02.574 --> 45:05.660
Hey, you! what's that?
What are you doing?

45:05.661 --> 45:07.203
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.830
- Hey!
- He coughed.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.832
No! You're disturbing us.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.291
I think he just coughed.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.377
- He coughed.
- Think I'm funny?

45:14.378 --> 45:16.462
- No.
- You think I'm funny?

45:16.463 --> 45:18.089
No.

45:18.090 --> 45:20.508
- Oh, is he funny?
- No.

45:20.509 --> 45:23.594
So, I see, it's the "aware"
thing, is that it?

45:23.595 --> 45:25.680
- Who are you?
- Drop it.

45:25.681 --> 45:28.683
No, wait!
Who do you think you are?

45:28.684 --> 45:32.019
You're 40 and still wearing
sweatshirts?

45:32.020 --> 45:33.187
Yeah.

45:33.188 --> 45:35.273
Who do you think you are?

45:35.274 --> 45:38.526
No, no, no!
Shut up, okay?

45:38.527 --> 45:41.028
He's tired, you know.
Drop it.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.321
- Tired?
- Yeah.

45:42.322 --> 45:44.866
I'm not tired, are you?
No, you're not.

45:44.867 --> 45:48.911
So shut up.

45:48.912 --> 45:52.165
Get up.
Yeah, get up, now!

45:55.335 --> 45:57.795
- Got a smoke?
- I don't smoke.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.048
Does anyone have a smoke?

46:26.325 --> 46:29.368
- So?
- It's ringing, but no answer.

46:29.369 --> 46:31.370
- No one?
- Nope.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.080
Forget it then.

46:33.081 --> 46:37.335
Go get me a screamo-phone,
like they use in the movies.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.879
To shout at the public.

46:39.880 --> 46:42.089
The day had
started out fine.

46:42.090 --> 46:45.301
But now I'm exhausted,
I'm fed up, I got scared.

46:45.302 --> 46:47.929
- Sir, let's stop ...
- Do I know you?

46:47.930 --> 46:49.388
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

46:49.389 --> 46:52.141
Sir, I'm freaking out!

46:52.142 --> 46:53.976
There's been a hold-up ...

46:53.977 --> 46:55.812
across the street —

46:55.813 --> 46:57.814
But look at my cab!

46:57.815 --> 47:01.984
That's what I'm saying,
let's proceed step by step.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.486
Look at my cab!

47:03.487 --> 47:04.946
A few questions first.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.406
I picked him up
at the airport.

47:07.407 --> 47:11.035
Did he have
any luggage, ma'am?

47:11.870 --> 47:13.204
Man, I can't.

47:13.205 --> 47:15.665
Please! Only once!

47:15.666 --> 47:18.251
I don't want to.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.878
Open your mouth.

47:20.879 --> 47:23.214
Be cool, just once.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.757
I'm exhausted.

47:24.758 --> 47:27.593
Do me a favor!
I might never see you again.

47:27.594 --> 47:32.014
Show me the move, just once,
please! Go ahead!

47:32.015 --> 47:34.267
Please, Jean-Claude.

47:49.074 --> 47:51.242
Let's all applaud!

47:56.290 --> 47:58.207
Nice, Jean-Claude.

47:58.208 --> 48:01.294
Told you he was the best!
Where are you going?

48:01.295 --> 48:03.838
Who told you to move?
Get back there.

48:03.839 --> 48:06.883
Faster!

48:06.884 --> 48:08.968
Where's my ciggy?

48:13.098 --> 48:14.640
Open your mouth.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.615
Move back a bit.

48:30.616 --> 48:32.325
A bit lower.

48:36.496 --> 48:38.247
- Jean-Claude?
- Yeah?

48:38.248 --> 48:40.666
- It's been years.
- So don't do it.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.335
Just once!

48:52.095 --> 48:55.556
He shows up and says, "Go!"
So off I went with him.

48:55.557 --> 48:56.724
He said that?

48:56.725 --> 48:58.601
Yes, sir.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.687
I did what he told me to,
he's a big star!

49:06.443 --> 49:08.861
- What's this?
- I just fell!

49:08.862 --> 49:10.696
And what are you doing?

49:10.697 --> 49:12.490
Come here now!

49:13.825 --> 49:16.661
- He needs a doc.
- Are you a nurse?

49:16.662 --> 49:18.871
Mr. Van Damme.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.289
This is ...

49:20.290 --> 49:23.209
Commissioner Bruges,
pick up the phone ...

49:23.210 --> 49:25.294
so we can talk.

49:25.295 --> 49:27.088
Is this a joke?

49:27.089 --> 49:29.090
No, Jean-Claude.

49:29.091 --> 49:31.258
They saw you with the cabinet.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.260
Moving a cabinet is
robbing a bank?

49:33.261 --> 49:35.763
Shut up!

49:35.764 --> 49:39.642
If you need anything,
pick up the phone.

49:39.643 --> 49:42.895
I'm your contact.

49:42.896 --> 49:45.022
Bruges.

49:47.651 --> 49:50.820
Here's our ticket out.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.697
I have enough problems ...

49:52.698 --> 49:54.949
I said, shut up!

49:57.911 --> 49:59.286
Go ahead, big shot.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.549
Are we having fun here?

50:14.302 --> 50:15.803
Can't believe it!

50:26.023 --> 50:28.315
- You read English?
- Yes.

50:39.369 --> 50:44.373
If you tell them,
you'll have blood on your hands.

50:44.374 --> 50:47.001
- What do I say?
- Let them talk.

50:48.795 --> 50:50.004
What's "custody"?

50:50.005 --> 50:51.881
He picked up!

50:56.470 --> 50:58.179
Mr. Van Damme.

51:00.265 --> 51:03.517
Bruges.
How's it going inside?

51:06.063 --> 51:08.689
It could be better.

51:08.690 --> 51:12.651
Okay, let me ask you first,
is anyone injured?

51:17.449 --> 51:20.409
A man's unconscious
and bleeding.

51:20.410 --> 51:23.537
Okay, good.
May I call you Jean-Claude?

51:23.538 --> 51:25.664
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

51:25.665 --> 51:28.501
You can call me Christian.

51:28.502 --> 51:31.045
You must release
the wounded man.

51:31.046 --> 51:34.632
Neither one of us wants to
have blood on our hands.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.175
Of course.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.885
Will you release him?

51:40.055 --> 51:43.224
No, no one leaves.
It's impossible.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.483
What if I came
with a doctor?

51:56.279 --> 52:00.574
Hey, if there's a murder,
it's no longer a robbery.

52:04.579 --> 52:08.207
- And if I come with a doc?
- All right, but unarmed.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.875
I give you my word.

52:09.876 --> 52:13.003
Bruges ...

52:13.004 --> 52:16.507
- Whoever walks in is dead.
- If a man dies, we're screwed.

52:16.508 --> 52:19.093
Heard me earlier?

52:19.094 --> 52:22.179
Well, they could come naked.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.807
In hostage movies, the bad 
guys ask the good guys ...

52:24.808 --> 52:29.061
to come in naked, so they
know they're clean.

52:29.062 --> 52:31.313
How about naked?

52:36.820 --> 52:38.863
Fine, tell them.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.055
Where's Petruccian?

53:06.725 --> 53:08.559
3. Stone falls on Egg,

53:08.560 --> 53:11.312
Egg breaks.

53:34.794 --> 53:37.338
Sorry, man!
Didn't recognize you!

55:17.522 --> 55:20.232
Aren't you Van Damme?

55:20.233 --> 55:23.152
You're Jean-Claude Van Damme,
my idol!

55:23.153 --> 55:26.488
Listen ...

55:26.489 --> 55:28.991
I'm really tired and I —

55:28.992 --> 55:32.202
Don't start acting
like a big shot,

55:32.203 --> 55:35.247
Mr. Hero of the century!

55:35.248 --> 55:39.626
I can finally talk to you
and listen to that tone.

55:39.627 --> 55:43.297
Let me talk to you.
You can rest, but let me talk.

55:43.298 --> 55:46.258
Close your eyes,
but let me talk to you.

55:46.259 --> 55:49.762
Anyway, when I see
you on-screen,

55:49.763 --> 55:52.765
well, you're
really different!

55:52.766 --> 55:53.932
Really?

55:53.933 --> 55:56.518
I think you look much
better on-screen.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.021
And you're much nicer, too.

55:59.022 --> 56:01.106
I can tell you that.

56:01.107 --> 56:04.651
- No, it's just that —
- Even if you're tired.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.071
I like you better on-screen.

56:07.072 --> 56:09.948
- You hurt my feelings.
- Oh, c'mon.

56:09.949 --> 56:13.410
I always thought you'd be
nicer.

56:13.411 --> 56:17.790
Everyone worships you here
in Belgium, you're our star!

56:17.791 --> 56:20.626
You represent us in Hollywood.

56:20.627 --> 56:23.337
Get used to having
a driver who talks.

56:23.338 --> 56:24.588
Okay.

56:24.589 --> 56:26.131
- Please!
- Sorry.

56:26.132 --> 56:28.050
Yes, sorry, yes.

56:28.051 --> 56:30.260
What's that?

56:30.261 --> 56:33.222
You don't need to show off!

56:33.223 --> 56:35.265
You're doing it on
purpose or what?

56:35.266 --> 56:39.144
No, I'm not.

56:39.145 --> 56:41.021
But you're nice.

56:41.022 --> 56:43.315
You, too, but even
more on-screen.

56:43.316 --> 56:44.650
It's hot in here.

56:44.651 --> 56:46.944
- Should I open?
- No, I'm tired.

56:46.945 --> 56:49.071
Then sleep, but let me talk.

56:49.072 --> 56:51.532
All cab drivers in
Brussels talk.

56:51.533 --> 56:57.204
You better get used to it
if you come here often.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.498
No, seriously!

56:59.499 --> 57:03.168
Star, star, star.
What are we talking about?

57:03.169 --> 57:06.630
I surely didn't expect
this kind of attitude!

57:06.631 --> 57:10.384
Ma'am, I didn't
mean to ... sorry.

57:10.385 --> 57:13.387
Well, you hurt me anyway.

57:13.388 --> 57:15.305
You don't realize,
you're my idol!

57:15.306 --> 57:16.765
I'm sorry.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.350
I saw all your films.

57:18.351 --> 57:21.645
How can you be so rude?

57:21.646 --> 57:24.606
I'm sorry, I'm tired.

57:24.607 --> 57:26.984
I still want
a picture with you.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.318
I promise.

57:28.319 --> 57:29.862
- Promise?
- Yes, ma'am.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.156
- And you'll sign it?
- Yes, ma'am.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.533
- It's for my son.
- Yes, ma'am.

57:34.534 --> 57:37.161
Jean-Claude!

58:01.853 --> 58:04.188
It's been over
an hour and a half now ...

58:04.189 --> 58:05.898
since Van Damme has taken
refuge ...

58:05.899 --> 58:09.318
in the Schaerbeek
downtown post office.

58:11.029 --> 58:14.198
She looks better on TV.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.867
We can't really
say what happened.

58:16.868 --> 58:19.745
After using
a gun several times,

58:19.746 --> 58:21.747
an anonymous source says ...

58:21.748 --> 58:25.501
So tell the source
to stay anonymous.

58:25.502 --> 58:29.254
If anyone blabs,
you'll hear from me!

58:29.255 --> 58:31.757
Yes, chief.

58:31.758 --> 58:35.385
Thank you, chief.
Call him back.

58:38.056 --> 58:41.892
No, he was here and there
were three people there.

58:41.893 --> 58:45.437
Okay, the Prefect authorized
the transfer. It's an order.

58:45.438 --> 58:46.980
And the ransom?

58:46.981 --> 58:49.775
- That'll have to calm him down.
- I've seen worse.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.360
There's no attack.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.403
With a kid inside,
I'm not budging.

58:55.990 --> 58:57.741
He picked up!

59:01.246 --> 59:02.579
Good news.

59:02.580 --> 59:05.165
- The transfer's authorized.
- Did it go through?

59:05.166 --> 59:06.625
It will ...

59:06.626 --> 59:08.126
If you cooperate.

59:08.127 --> 59:11.672
Sorry, but it's
a two-way street.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.173
And the money?

59:13.174 --> 59:16.635
Same thing,
it'll take a bit longer.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.887
You're gonna have to cooperate.

59:18.888 --> 59:20.347
It's ...

59:20.348 --> 59:21.807
What do you want?

59:21.808 --> 59:24.101
The kid. Let him go.

59:28.439 --> 59:31.191
I'll call you back.

59:31.192 --> 59:35.904
The crowd's agitated.
Something's going on over there.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.322
What's the commotion?

59:37.323 --> 59:40.409
Let's go.
Despite all this confusion,

59:40.410 --> 59:42.661
a car is trying to get through.

59:43.663 --> 59:45.747
- Who is it?
- What?

59:45.748 --> 59:48.041
- Who is it?
- The Van Varenbergs.

59:48.042 --> 59:49.835
- Who?
- Van Damme's parents.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.753
Why don't you escort them?

59:54.215 --> 59:58.218
Please! Please!

59:58.219 --> 01:00:01.179
Mrs. Van Damme!
Your son ...

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.098
My son's a good man!

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.600
No comment!

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:08.145
What do you think you're doing?
Trying to screw me?

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:11.231
- You're nuts or what?
- Say you wanna screw me.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:13.775
- I'm not saying that.
- The kid stays.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:16.820
- They gave in.
- Shut up. It's our only vest.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.447
He's right. They gave in.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.490
Hey, who's doing
the hold-up?

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:23.076
They gave in to him.
No hostage is leaving.

01:00:23.077 --> 01:00:25.078
Get back, I told you!

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.872
For the second time,
don't move!

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.458
- Watch your tone.
- I do as I please.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.294
- Get on back!
- Shut up, you heard me.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.379
- Lower your gun.
- Calm down!

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.589
You lower yours first.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.425
- Go on back.
- Shut up and lower your gun.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.469
- Go on back.
- I'm going now.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.512
They'll break negotiations.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:45.140
And I'll break your neck.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.145
If it's not the kid,
get a hostage go.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.482
Just don't shoot, man.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.651
Don't shoot.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.361
Stop it.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:00.572
He's right.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:03.325
If we let one go,
he's gonna talk.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.952
Not the one
I'm thinking of.

01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:49.371
Tell them we'll release one.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.123
Your maniac son
already hurt someone.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.959
Maniac?

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.877
He's Jean-Claude.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.754
He's Camille.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:59.423
He's Francois.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:02.426
He's Van Damme
or Van Varenberg!

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:05.345
But he's not a maniac!

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.059
Get outta here.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.481
He's on the line, boss.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:23.113
Gotta do something
for the kid.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.283
Help me convince
your son to let him go.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:38.920
Okay for a hostage,
but not for the kid.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.923
Someone wants to talk to you.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:49.514
Honey?

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:53.268
Mom?

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:56.813
What are you doing, son?

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.940
Nothing.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.401
Nothing!

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.987
Please talk to me, dear.

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:06.823
Nothing, Mom.

01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:08.450
Mom, give me the —

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.952
Son of a bitch!

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.371
Get my lawyer on the phone.

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:15.540
Tell them I'm
releasing a hostage.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.959
Don't cry, Mom.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:23.340
Hurry up!

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.721
Take them away.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.024
It was my mother.

01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:44.361
I don't give a shit
about your mother.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:46.863
Wanna hear about mine?

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:49.533
- Last time I saw her ...
- What?

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.701
... was when I was born.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.623
He tries to screw me,
then he makes me cry.

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:59.751
You come with me.

01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:02.337
- Why?
- 'Cause you're getting out.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.632
So let's go.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:06.842
No, he stays here.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.260
C'mon, mister.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.638
Make the transfer
and get me his lawyer.

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.352
Rule number one:

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:21.523
It's the maniac that
shows good faith.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:27.571
C'mon.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:35.120
- Why do I have to go?
- Shut up. Come with me.

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:37.205
Why do you want to keep him?

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:39.457
He stays here.
You come with me.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.293
Let him go.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.128
Not without me.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:46.464
Not without my son!

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.063
Boss, the lawyer's on the line.

01:05:20.374 --> 01:05:23.460
Stand up, up you go!

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:27.339
Let me go!

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.883
- You sure are lucky.
- So are you.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.719
- With your gun.
- You, too, sure are lucky.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.221
You're really lucky.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:44.022
Let me go!

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:50.528
Damien, I'll be back.
Mommy's coming back!

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:55.492
Move.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:04.834
Move. Get up.

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:07.212
When I say "get up,"
you get up!

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.214
One word and you're dead.

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:23.019
If you open your mouth,

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.188
you're gonna find
your kid in pieces.

01:06:27.191 --> 01:06:30.193
I'll take care of him.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:34.322
What? You can't even take
care of your own kid!

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.949
It's all your fault!

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.534
They're raising the curtain!

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.823
Stand back!

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:20.452
Please, ma'am,
I said, stand back.

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:41.681
Over there.

01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:44.059
Over there, I said.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.898
Okay, so we put it all in boxes.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.941
I'm gonna keep
a Christmas decoration.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:53.777
I like this one.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.612
It's a little beauty.

01:07:55.613 --> 01:08:00.158
This way, we'll remember
it's almost Mardi Gras.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:04.662
Our minds crossed.
I took a heart from my tree.

01:08:04.663 --> 01:08:07.832
Yeah, and St. Valentine's Day
is coming up.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.001
Hooray for love.

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:11.461
Dimitri's so romantic.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.214
It's our 1,500th show today!

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.434
This movie is for me.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.812
There we are,
you and me.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.904
Why did you do that?

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:42.575
Or why did I do that?

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:44.577
You made my dream come true.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.537
I asked you for it.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.790
I promised you
something in return,

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.502
and I haven't delivered yet.

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:58.258
You win, I lose.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.593
Unless ...

01:09:00.594 --> 01:09:04.139
the path you've set for me ...

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.099
is full of hurdles,

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.060
where the answer
comes before the question.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:13.356
Yeah, I do that.

01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:15.984
Now I know why.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:20.446
It's the cure,
from what I've seen here.

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:23.073
It all makes sense.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:26.786
It makes sense to those
who understand.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:32.082
So ... America ...

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.460
poverty ...

01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:37.296
stealing to eat ...

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:42.135
stalking producers,
actors, movie stars,

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.763
going to clubs hoping
to see a star,

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:49.058
with my pictures,
karate magazines.

01:09:49.059 --> 01:09:52.270
It's all I had.
I didn't speak English.

01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:57.400
But I did 20 years of karate.

01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:00.445
'Cause before
I wasn't like that.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.822
This ... this is me today.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:06.576
I used to be
small and scrawny.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.036
And I took up karate.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.038
Hence the Dojo,
hence respect.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:13.666
Thou shall believe
people who say,

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:16.336
"Oss!"

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.671
It's Samurai code.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:20.340
It's honor, no lies.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.842
So this guy in the U.S.,

01:10:22.843 --> 01:10:25.053
it's not the same thing.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.555
No one says "Oss" to you.

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:30.975
Sometimes people
in show business ...

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:38.441
I believed in people,
in the Dojo.

01:10:38.442 --> 01:10:42.987
I was blessed
and had a lot of "wives."

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:45.490
I always believed in love.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:49.494
It's hard for a woman
with three kids to say,

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.829
"Which one do I love more?"

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.998
A mother ...

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:58.169
If you have five, six, seven,
or ten wives in a lifetime,

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:01.047
they've all got
something special,

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.174
but no one cares about that ...

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:06.803
in the so-called media.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.015
What about drugs?

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:14.769
When you got it all,
you travel the world.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.646
When you've been
in all the hotels,

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:21.776
you're the prima donna
of the penthouse.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:25.530
And in hotels
the world over, traveling.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:29.325
You want something more.

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:31.536
And because
of a woman —

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.955
Well, because of love,

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:37.292
I tried something
and I got hooked.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:42.088
Van Damme, the beast ...

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.007
the tiger in a cage,

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:47.802
the Bloodsport man got hooked.

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:51.806
I was wasted mentally
and physically,

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:56.519
to the point that
I got out of it.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.192
I got out of it.

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.153
But ...

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:11.075
It's all there.

01:12:12.786 --> 01:12:15.204
It was really tough.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.251
I saw people worse off
than me.

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.462
I went from poor
to rich and thought,

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:25.048
why aren't we all like me?

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.966
Why all the privileges?

01:12:26.967 --> 01:12:29.052
I'm just a regular guy.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:32.680
It makes me sick to see people ...

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.807
who don't have what I've got.

01:12:34.808 --> 01:12:36.934
Knowing that ...

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:40.396
they have qualities, too.

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:43.399
Much more than I do!

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.778
It's not my fault if I was
cut out to be a star.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.488
I asked for it.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:50.698
I asked for it,
really believed in it.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:53.534
When you're 13, you believe
in your dream.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.495
Well, it came true for me.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:58.498
But I still ask myself today ...

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:01.501
what I've done on this earth.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.503
Nothing!

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.671
I've done nothing!

01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:13.137
And I might just die
in this post office ...

01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:17.266
hoping to start all over
here in Belgium,

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:21.104
in my country,
where my roots are.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:26.109
Start all over with my parents
and get my heath back,

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:29.445
pick up again.
So I really hope ...

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:34.909
nobody's gonna pull a trigger
in this post office.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:39.914
It's so stupid to kill people.
They're so beautiful.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:45.128
So today, I pray to God.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.380
I truly believe ...

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.465
it's not a movie.

01:13:49.466 --> 01:13:53.636
It's real life.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:55.596
Real life.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.938
I've seen so many things.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.149
I was born in Belgium,

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.693
but I'm a citizen of the world.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.487
I've traveled a lot.

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:14.991
It's hard for me
to judge people,

01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:17.910
and it's hard for them ...

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.999
not to judge me.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.710
Easier to blame me.

01:14:27.087 --> 01:14:30.173
Yeah, something like that.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.686
Dimitri's so romantic.

01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:45.688
It's our 1,500th
show today!

01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:48.274
And I'm giving out
rare items,

01:14:48.275 --> 01:14:51.903
like the red wig "Veronique
et Sebastien" never wore.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.446
We don't know why!

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:58.159
It's the hat full of
ideas for reportages.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.996
Say, Arthur?

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:05.082
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:10.671
We've gotta free the hostages.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.465
I can't do that,
Jean-Claude.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:16.469
Yes, you can. It's easy.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:18.095
We just go there,

01:15:18.096 --> 01:15:20.806
raise the curtain,

01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:22.808
and split!

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.687
4. Egg falls on Stone,

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:29.106
Egg breaks.

01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:32.193
Seven hostages left.
How are we gonna hold out?

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.778
It's okay, we need time.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.571
Wait for what,
what's the plan?

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:37.573
The cops question her,
then what?

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:39.951
- They count the dough.
- After that ...

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.078
Hey, what dough?

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:45.122
You're waiting for them
to count the million?

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:48.709
You crazy? What's a million?
I won't calm down.

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:51.796
How are you gonna get out?
She'll blab.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.422
No, we've got the kid.

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:55.841
I tell you,
the first one to leave dies.

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:57.385
You can't kill anyone.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.554
I'll kill whoever I like.
No more talking.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.890
The next one out is dead.
A hostage, whatever.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.184
Whatever you want, you got it?

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:08.646
We'll obtain more that way
and have the upper hand.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.024
What are you doing?

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:15.152
What?
You want to hold it for me?

01:16:15.153 --> 01:16:16.696
Let's wait for the bus.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:20.157
What the bus?
We're gonna go home by bus?

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:23.286
Why not on the subway!

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:28.207
Hey, it's the second round
or what?

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.458
I'm pissing.

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:31.460
- Pissing?
- Yeah.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:32.795
You piss silently?

01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:34.338
Yeah, don't you?

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:36.132
- You piss white?
- Yeah.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:38.718
You piss invisible!
Think I'm an idiot?

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.761
Why? Are you sick?

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.888
Do you piss yellow? Red?

01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:44.265
At least there's color.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.559
- You're sick.
- So I'm sick?

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.519
- I'm sick?
- Yeah.

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:53.983
Wait, I'm going
back to my spot ...

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:58.362
Where the fuck are they?

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:12.627
Back in the room, faster!

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:25.139
Let her through,
she's the mother, it's her son!

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:38.653
Move back!

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.449
What do you want?

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.243
You wanna screw
me over again?

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.329
I was just trying to help ...

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:50.998
Move back!

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.167
I said, move back!

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:56.337
- Don't shoot.
- Move back, move back.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.547
Don't fucking shoot!

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:04.178
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna shoot me?

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.514
What I'm doing?
What about you?

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.516
Whose side are you on?

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.227
- Who are you with?
- Shut up!

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.022
Let him go!

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:25.116
We want information!

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.618
I said,
get the fuck out of here!

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.370
You, motherfucker!

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.579
Let go.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.627
Sir!

01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:38.796
My son, Jean-Claude ...

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:42.758
- What's going on?
- Is Jean-Claude dead, or ...

01:18:42.759 --> 01:18:45.970
Answer me, damn it!
He's my son!

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.265
Make her stop crying!

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:52.184
I said, let go!

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.236
What?

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.905
Go ahead, shoot!

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:08.075
You, too, get lost!

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:13.831
Back to our correspondent
in Los Angeles,

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.875
where it seems
Van Damme's attorney ...

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:18.919
has a statement to make.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:42.485
Go over there!

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:44.028
Bang!

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:45.446
Like in movies.

01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:00.419
What the hell
are you doing?

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.463
Whose side are you on,
you dork?

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.257
That moron
soften you up?

01:20:05.258 --> 01:20:07.551
Oh, yeah,
I'm the dork?

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:11.347
Yeah, a 32-year-old who still
watches karate films?

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.974
And who gets softened
up like a beginner?

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.476
- A beginner?
- Yeah.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:17.311
Robbing a post office
at my age,

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.562
that's a youth mistake.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:19.897
But at 52 ...

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:22.274
Yeah, right,
52 years old.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:25.402
You owe me some respect,
I could be your father.

01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:27.571
My father?
Because of your age?

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:30.783
No, because
I fucked your mother.

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:34.745
Sure.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:48.968
Are you happy now?

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:50.886
Did you ever go to school?

01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:54.390
You'd know that stone
falls on egg,

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:57.059
breaks egg.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.271
And egg which ...

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:04.567
an egg which falls ...

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:14.785
Because we can't ...

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:17.997
You can't save ...

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:20.291
the world.

01:21:31.511 --> 01:21:34.179
What?

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.849
We said, "Not the mothers!"

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:53.073
I don't wanna die.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:07.588
It's over, it's over.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.972
Don't worry, Jean-Claude.

01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:20.643
Aren't we better off
without him?

01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:38.452
- He shot him in the head.
- Put Jean-Claude on.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.891
Jean-Claude?

01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:03.102
I wanted to ask you ...

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:09.024
Could you sign me an autograph?

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:15.114
For Arthur.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.825
Promise?

01:23:19.577 --> 01:23:21.495
Thanks.

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:44.268
The cops.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.270
- No!
- Yes.

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:53.610
Arthur?

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:55.779
Don't shoot.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.740
Police!

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:11.128
Police! Don't move!

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:56.965
I'm a hostage!

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.598
I need a doctor, now!

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.975
- Drop the gun!
- Get lost!

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.523
Get out or I'll smoke him!

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:15.442
- Drop the gun!
- Let him go!

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:24.409
Get outta here
or I'll smoke him!

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:27.788
It's not him!

01:25:32.335 --> 01:25:34.628
It's not Jean-Claude!

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:46.306
- Get outta here!
- Drop the gun!

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:49.601
I'm gonna smoke him!
Get outta here!

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:30.035
I didn't do anything!

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:44.716
What the hell is going on here?

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:47.594
You're a criminal!

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.847
Extortion of $465,000
from the Belgian state.

01:27:50.848 --> 01:27:53.600
- Extortion?
- What extortion?

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.936
There's no extortion!

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.480
You're an asshole.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:57.622
A few months later.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:03.712
During the trial,
Van Damme seemed quite serene,

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:08.216
and wishes to remain silent ...
Here he comes.

01:29:08.217 --> 01:29:10.719
Mr. Van Damme, a statement?

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.263
Do you agree with
the court's verdict?

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:41.124
Jean-Claude Van Damme,
as mentioned earlier,

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:44.503
will serve one year
for extortion of funds.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:48.924
He should serve his sentence
in Brussels' suburbs.

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:53.428
And this ends
the thrilling judicial series.

01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:57.516
We just heard
of the incredible escape ...

01:30:01.604 --> 01:30:05.399
If the knee is lower
than the foot, like this ...

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.984
you won't have
any strength.

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:22.499
Harder!

01:30:31.467 --> 01:30:34.469
Jean-Claude! Visiting Room!

01:30:58.035 --> 01:31:00.579
How are you, Mom?

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.038
Aren't you cold?

01:31:02.039 --> 01:31:05.542
No, no, I just gave
the guys a karate lesson.

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:08.753
- You teach karate?
- Yeah, keeps me busy.

01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:09.963
That's nice.

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:12.799
Your father asked
how you were doing and ...

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.469
wanted to tell you stuff ...

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.012
Is he okay?

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.681
I'll be right back,
I have a surprise.

01:31:19.682 --> 01:31:22.726
- Excuse me?
- I have a surprise for you.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:25.645
- I've had plenty of surprises.
- Wait a sec.

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.772
We don't have much time.
