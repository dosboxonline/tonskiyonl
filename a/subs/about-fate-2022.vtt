WEBVTT

01:06.840 --> 01:08.873
Today's the day.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.757
Today's the day.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.121
What?
Don't look at me like that.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.459
It could happen.

01:36.632 --> 01:38.502
-Good morning.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.285
Yes.

01:51.687 --> 01:52.747
Yes!

01:55.585 --> 01:57.290
I'll think about it.

02:01.395 --> 02:03.862
That's a proposal-worthy face.
Right?

02:03.931 --> 02:06.530
Well, I'd marry you.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.587
Hey. Teddy? Come on.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.740
What? You lick your own butt.

02:48.971 --> 02:50.975
I'm feeling much better,
thank you for asking.

03:06.221 --> 03:07.459
Oh.

04:12.823 --> 04:14.090
<i>So, when do</i>
<i>we pick up the ring?</i>

04:14.159 --> 04:15.160
Morning, Mom.

04:15.229 --> 04:16.495
You know, I already told you

04:16.563 --> 04:18.197
I'm gonna pick up the ring
on my lunch hour.

04:18.499 --> 04:20.198
So, you know, I actually
don't need any help.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.566
<i>-Yeah, I know.</i>
-Thanks.

04:21.635 --> 04:22.930
<i>But you know</i>
<i>how forgetful you are.</i>

04:22.999 --> 04:24.564
<i>And that cold medicine</i>
<i>makes you loopy.</i>

04:24.632 --> 04:26.338
Yeah, well, I don't know,

04:26.407 --> 04:27.500
I feel like
I'm not gonna forget

04:27.569 --> 04:28.940
my engagement ring,

04:29.009 --> 04:30.173
even with a cold.

04:30.242 --> 04:31.576
But I appreciate it.

04:31.645 --> 04:33.776
<i>And don't stop taking</i>
<i>that medicine.</i>

04:33.845 --> 04:35.608
<i>You know,</i>
<i>no woman wants to say yes</i>

04:35.676 --> 04:37.412
<i>to a crusty nose.</i>

04:38.148 --> 04:40.949
<i>You have to remember</i>
<i>you only have one day a year</i>

04:41.017 --> 04:42.985
<i>when you can propose</i>
<i>on December 30th.</i>

04:43.054 --> 04:45.786
<i>You know, three generations</i>
<i>of Reeds can't be wrong.</i>

04:45.855 --> 04:47.626
Yeah, I'm well aware.
No, I know.

04:47.695 --> 04:49.460
But I gotta go, okay?
But I'll talk to you later.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.531
<i>Oh, who'd have thought,</i>
<i>my son,</i>

04:51.600 --> 04:53.862
<i>two times Student Samaritan</i>
<i>of the Month,</i>

04:54.165 --> 04:57.663
<i>engaged to a girl with</i>
<i>her own park bench? Like...</i>

04:57.732 --> 04:59.231
I know. I know.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.372
All right, well, I love you,
okay? Gotta go. Bye.

05:01.441 --> 05:02.604
<i>Oh, and just one more thing...</i>

05:02.672 --> 05:05.038
-Oh, shit!

05:06.448 --> 05:09.383
Dad proposed to you
after one week.

05:09.451 --> 05:10.945
<i>Well, that was</i>
<i>a different time.</i>

05:11.013 --> 05:12.651
<i>And your dad</i>
<i>wanted to get laid.</i>

05:12.854 --> 05:14.847
<i>Oh, as a matter of fact,</i>
<i>he's on his way back now.</i>

05:14.916 --> 05:16.417
<i>We're in our hotel room, so...</i>

05:16.485 --> 05:18.050
Okay, TMI, Mom.

05:18.119 --> 05:20.653
Anyway, he made
dinner reservations

05:20.722 --> 05:22.690
and says he wants to talk.

05:22.758 --> 05:24.256
<i>Oh, I hope it's not cancer.</i>

05:24.325 --> 05:26.499
What if the first time
you're meeting my boyfriend,

05:26.568 --> 05:29.403
you're actually
meeting my fiancÃ©?

05:29.472 --> 05:31.565
<i>Okay, we've been</i>
<i>down this road before</i>

05:31.634 --> 05:32.834
<i>and it never ends well.</i>

05:33.003 --> 05:34.304
<i>Look, you have a date</i>
<i>to the wedding,</i>

05:34.372 --> 05:35.673
<i>just take the win.</i>

05:35.742 --> 05:38.144
I wonder if it's too late
to get a spray tan.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.612
<i>Your sister will kill you</i>

05:39.681 --> 05:41.108
<i>if you have a tan</i>
<i>at her winter wedding.</i>

05:41.177 --> 05:44.651
Well, maybe I want to be
tanned for my winter proposal.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.217
- <i> I will meet you</i>
<i>at the bridal shop at noon.</i>

05:46.286 --> 05:48.487
<i>Do not be late. Again.</i>

05:48.556 --> 05:50.116
<i>-Love you.</i>

05:52.092 --> 05:53.491
Morning, Doris.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.255
-Double tall latte.

05:55.323 --> 05:58.524
You are the sweetest lawyer
in the entire building.

05:58.593 --> 05:59.829
Stop.

06:00.803 --> 06:01.897
Oh. Um...

06:01.966 --> 06:03.767
Yeah, it's actually
not what you think it is.

06:03.836 --> 06:05.836
Oh, well,
it looks like coffee.

06:05.905 --> 06:08.072
Well, then I guess it is
what you think it is, Doris.

06:08.141 --> 06:09.141
There we go.

06:09.210 --> 06:10.471
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey!

06:10.540 --> 06:12.305
Big night tonight.

06:12.841 --> 06:14.347
Yeah, you a little nervous?

06:14.415 --> 06:16.182
Well, clearly.
Oh, shit. Nice.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.550
I get it. It's not every day

06:17.619 --> 06:20.051
you propose
to the hottest chick in town.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.280
Oh.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.417
Okay, can you please not refer
to my future wife as a chick?

06:23.485 --> 06:24.688
Oh, sorry.

06:24.957 --> 06:27.060
-Empress. Duchess. Mistress.
-You know what? No.

06:27.129 --> 06:28.086
She's not like that, okay?

06:28.155 --> 06:29.661
Oh, yeah?
You use her Sonicare again?

06:29.730 --> 06:31.530
No, I already told you,
that was my fault.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.827
-I should've asked.
-Listen, buddy.

06:32.895 --> 06:34.633
There is
an unspoken list of things

06:34.701 --> 06:37.037
that couples in relationships
can share.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.071
Okay? You've got porn,

06:39.140 --> 06:40.333
you've got razors,

06:40.635 --> 06:42.108
toothbrushes.

06:42.644 --> 06:44.344
-Mostly porn.
-Okay. I'm just gonna need you

06:44.413 --> 06:45.677
to stop worrying
about my girlfriend

06:45.745 --> 06:46.839
and just focus
on getting your own, okay?

06:46.908 --> 06:48.480
Hey, I'm working on it, man.

06:48.549 --> 06:51.810
"I am Sam" is up
on Hinge and Tinder.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.112
You know that's a movie

06:53.181 --> 06:54.447
about the mentally
disabled guy, right?

06:54.883 --> 06:56.520
-Shit.
-Just saying.

06:56.589 --> 06:58.285
I thought
I was low on matches.

07:01.394 --> 07:03.624
Oh, my God.

07:03.693 --> 07:05.428
You missed the best party.

07:05.496 --> 07:06.764
Totally should have come.

07:06.832 --> 07:08.294
Yeah, I wanted to,
but all you texted me

07:08.362 --> 07:10.598
was the side of a building
and the name "Paco."

07:10.667 --> 07:13.902
Paco! Oh, my God. So cute.

07:13.971 --> 07:15.675
We should all
grab drinks at lunch.

07:15.743 --> 07:18.041
I can't. I have the stupid
final dress fitting.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.478
My sister's worried I'm gonna
put on a late 10 pounds

07:20.547 --> 07:22.247
and ruin
her perfect aesthetic.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.516
Fine. After work, then.

07:23.585 --> 07:25.485
Stop pretending
like you don't know

07:25.554 --> 07:28.419
what's possibly
maybe happening tonight.

07:28.488 --> 07:29.985
Why are you getting engaged

07:30.053 --> 07:32.118
to a man who's hiding
from your friends?

07:32.521 --> 07:35.426
He's not hiding. He's earning
his third-degree black belt.

07:35.495 --> 07:37.124
I mean, that's time-consuming.

07:37.192 --> 07:39.592
And he's getting over
a really bad cold.

07:39.661 --> 07:41.133
For three months?

07:41.202 --> 07:42.800
Can you just support me?

07:42.868 --> 07:46.170
Okay? I think I have
finally found Mr. Right.

07:46.239 --> 07:48.071
I do support you.

07:48.139 --> 07:51.477
I just think Mr. Right is not
the guy that calls you

07:51.546 --> 07:53.378
while he's sitting
on your face.

07:53.447 --> 07:54.713
My face is on a park bench.

07:54.781 --> 07:56.077
You're supposed to sit on it
and call me.

07:56.146 --> 07:59.212
If they're shopping for homes,
not vagina.

07:59.748 --> 08:01.217
He said it was fate.

08:01.519 --> 08:02.582
-No!

08:02.651 --> 08:03.990
It's advertising.

08:04.059 --> 08:05.323
Fate is magical.

08:05.391 --> 08:07.088
Fate is supernatural.

08:07.157 --> 08:10.196
Fate is meeting Calvin Harris
at Coachella,

08:10.264 --> 08:11.528
losing him in a crowd,

08:11.597 --> 08:13.326
then waking up in Joshua Tree

08:13.394 --> 08:16.933
to find him making s'mores
by an open campfire.

08:18.173 --> 08:19.538
Without his shirt on.

08:19.607 --> 08:22.142
-That was a fun weekend.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.537
I have to work. Please.

08:23.606 --> 08:24.606
Oh, my God.

08:24.675 --> 08:25.971
Oh, my God.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.278
Oh, my God. You're so boring.

08:27.347 --> 08:28.748
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.480
- <i> And you're positive</i>
<i>he's coming.</i>

08:30.549 --> 08:32.515
- <i> Yes, he's coming.</i>

08:32.584 --> 08:34.279
Why do you keep asking me?

08:34.348 --> 08:35.853
- Because
no one's even met him.

08:35.922 --> 08:38.084
And you do have a history
of fake boyfriends.

08:38.153 --> 08:40.191
Okay, that was one time.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.253
Kip is real.

08:41.322 --> 08:43.362
He's my date.
You're gonna love him.

08:43.431 --> 08:45.499
-It's $40 a plate.
-So?

08:45.568 --> 08:46.829
-$40 a plate. It's just...
-Okay, so?

08:46.898 --> 08:48.061
We're not having
a rehearsal dinner,

08:48.130 --> 08:49.903
so we can have
a really nice reception.

08:49.972 --> 08:51.969
And if he's not coming, then
we'll invite Brian's Auntie V.

08:52.038 --> 08:55.006
Oh, okay. Well, screw Auntie V
because he's coming.

08:55.074 --> 08:56.740
And if he doesn't, I'll be
sure to write you a check.

08:56.809 --> 08:57.972
- Well, you can
write it out to me.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.277
Who do you think
is paying for this thing?

08:59.346 --> 09:00.547
Isn't the groom's family

09:00.749 --> 09:02.043
traditionally supposed to pay
for that part?

09:02.112 --> 09:03.645
-Mm...
-Okay, sorry, are you calling

09:03.713 --> 09:04.847
Brian's family cheap?

09:04.916 --> 09:06.180
No, they happen
to be taking us

09:06.348 --> 09:08.086
to a really fancy brunch
the day after the wedding.

09:08.855 --> 09:10.218
Are we almost done here?
Because I don't want

09:10.286 --> 09:11.588
to be late for my spray tan
appointment, so...

09:11.657 --> 09:12.985
No, no. Mom? See, I told you.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.219
She's gonna ruin the wedding.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.460
Okay, how is
me getting a spray tan

09:16.529 --> 09:17.829
gonna ruin the wedding?

09:17.898 --> 09:19.565
I don't know.
You'll turn yourself orange

09:19.633 --> 09:21.565
or you'll get UV-poisoning
and die.

09:21.634 --> 09:22.733
You will figure out some way

09:22.801 --> 09:25.135
to make my wedding
all about...

09:25.204 --> 09:26.266
you.

09:27.939 --> 09:29.805
-Prom?
-Still haven't let that go?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.005
-Yeah.
-It's not my fault

09:31.174 --> 09:32.712
that Dylan Kidd
liked me better than you.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.109
Well, you're the one
who gave him a blow job

09:34.178 --> 09:35.915
in the guest bathroom.
So, it is your fault.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.882
Yeah, well, that's because
you take forever to get ready.

09:38.317 --> 09:39.719
- Mom?

09:40.255 --> 09:41.480
It is true, you do.

09:41.549 --> 09:43.586
I knew it. I knew I should've
asked Gloria Hefner

09:43.655 --> 09:44.654
to be my maid of honor.

09:44.723 --> 09:46.219
Gloria Hefner has one eyebrow.

09:46.288 --> 09:48.055
How fast can you make
another dress?

09:48.124 --> 09:50.059
No, no, no.
She's out of the wedding!

09:50.128 --> 09:51.696
-Out, out, yes! Yeah.
-Promise? Swear? Promise?

09:51.765 --> 09:55.168
Okay, girls, girls, girls!
Enough.

09:55.236 --> 09:56.296
You're sisters.

09:56.364 --> 09:59.201
So, that means, by law,
you are bound to pretend

09:59.270 --> 10:02.034
to love each other and
be in each other's weddings.

10:02.103 --> 10:04.042
That's just how it goes. Okay?

10:04.110 --> 10:09.078
So, why don't you two say
something nice to each other?

10:10.716 --> 10:12.411
Nothing comes to mind, so...

10:12.480 --> 10:14.615
- Here you go, sir.
Sized and shined.

10:14.684 --> 10:16.552
Oh, my God.

10:16.621 --> 10:17.986
Oh, honey, no, no.

10:18.055 --> 10:20.022
Mom,
what are you doing here?

10:20.091 --> 10:21.387
I told you,
I don't any help today.

10:21.456 --> 10:22.955
- Well, from the looks
of this box, you do.

10:23.024 --> 10:24.291
What's wrong with the box?

10:24.559 --> 10:26.830
Well, it's just dull.
I mean, it doesn't sing to me.

10:26.898 --> 10:28.997
Do you have these
in another color

10:29.066 --> 10:31.235
like gold, or glitter,
or faux fur?

10:31.304 --> 10:34.240
Yeah, apparently we're looking
for the BeyoncÃ© of ring boxes.

10:34.309 --> 10:35.368
We just have these.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.311
My only son is getting engaged
for the very first time in...

10:38.380 --> 10:39.504
I mean, you can understand

10:39.573 --> 10:41.777
how I just want
this proposal to be perfect.

10:41.846 --> 10:43.178
And it will be perfect, okay?

10:43.247 --> 10:44.784
So, you don't really
have to worry about it.

10:44.852 --> 10:48.282
Uh-huh. So, maybe,
I could hear it first?

10:49.251 --> 10:50.883
-Hear what?
-Your proposal speech.

10:50.952 --> 10:52.357
Oh, no. No, no, no.

10:52.426 --> 10:53.658
Absolutely not. No.

10:53.726 --> 10:55.158
Just try it out.
Just for safety.

10:55.227 --> 10:57.993
No, I'm not proposing
to my mother. That's crazy.

10:58.061 --> 11:00.866
Okay. Suit yourself.

11:01.935 --> 11:03.402
-Sorry, this is...
-It's a nice box.

11:03.471 --> 11:04.738
It's a really nice box.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.673
Well, it's only the
single-most important thing

11:06.742 --> 11:09.535
you'll ever say
to a woman, but, uh,

11:10.238 --> 11:12.144
you'll be fine
just winging it.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.247
Okay. You know what? One time.

11:14.316 --> 11:15.441
But you say nothing.

11:16.448 --> 11:17.949
All right.

11:24.658 --> 11:25.821
-Babe?

11:25.890 --> 11:27.385
Ever since I saw your face,

11:27.454 --> 11:30.525
staring up at me
from that park bench,

11:31.228 --> 11:33.165
I knew that you were
the one for me.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.735
Your beauty, your drive,
your energy...

11:37.070 --> 11:39.531
I mean, I never thought
that some guy like me

11:39.600 --> 11:42.567
would end up with
an incredible woman like you.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.442
You inspire me.

11:45.511 --> 11:46.679
You challenge me.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.212
You push me
out of my comfort zone

11:48.280 --> 11:50.515
because I know you just
want me to be a better man.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.813
And because of you, I am.

11:55.257 --> 11:56.352
Clementine,

11:57.122 --> 11:59.358
will you please
do me the great honor

11:59.427 --> 12:00.385
of becoming my wife?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.827
Oh! Honey, of course, I will.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.859
-- Aw.
-All right.

12:04.928 --> 12:06.261
That's that. All right.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.798
-Oh! Oh, God!
-No, it's not cool. Just...

12:08.867 --> 12:10.603
I'll take these.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.345
Wow!

12:19.414 --> 12:21.408
You look stunning.

12:21.477 --> 12:23.914
You look
quite dapper yourself.

12:23.983 --> 12:25.213
I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

12:25.382 --> 12:26.747
Oh, well, I'm still taking
the cold medicine,

12:26.816 --> 12:28.085
just to be safe.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.019
<i>Yeah, I know this place is</i>
<i>kind of a surprise, but, um,</i>

12:31.088 --> 12:32.722
you know,
it's sentimental for me.

12:32.791 --> 12:33.924
My family actually does

12:34.160 --> 12:35.054
their New Year's day brunch
here, every year.

12:35.123 --> 12:36.863
I think Bennigan's is fun.

12:36.932 --> 12:38.390
I mean, the cocktails
are super creative.

12:38.459 --> 12:40.962
Ooh, yeah,
should we order drinks?

12:41.031 --> 12:42.330
Peach on the Beach looks good.

12:42.399 --> 12:44.468
Oh, my God, Peach on the Beach
is the best.

12:46.105 --> 12:49.173
I am so excited
for tomorrow.

12:49.241 --> 12:51.204
I mean, I can't wait for you
to meet my family.

12:51.373 --> 12:52.978
<i>Uh, the wedding starts</i>
<i>at- 00.</i>

12:53.046 --> 12:55.245
Yeah, yeah. So, I'm just
gonna go into the city,

12:55.314 --> 12:57.417
meet the guys, and then,
I should have plenty of time

12:57.485 --> 12:58.610
to come back, shower.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.887
And then, uh, I'll be
at your place by- 00?

13:00.956 --> 13:02.251
I picked up your tux
from the dry cleaner,

13:02.320 --> 13:03.815
so you can just get ready
at mine.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.254
Perfect.

13:08.122 --> 13:09.523
You know, it's funny,

13:09.592 --> 13:12.032
even though we haven't
been together that long...

13:12.100 --> 13:14.567
I know, I can't believe
it's only been three months.

13:14.636 --> 13:15.767
Feels like forever.

13:15.836 --> 13:16.898
You know,
it's funny, my parents

13:16.967 --> 13:18.532
actually have this saying,

13:19.101 --> 13:22.101
"When you know, you know."

13:22.170 --> 13:23.708
"When you know, you know."

13:23.777 --> 13:24.942
Believe it or not, they, uh...

13:25.011 --> 13:28.046
they actually got engaged
at a Bennigan's.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.019
Welcome to Bennigan's.

13:33.388 --> 13:34.683
OMG.

13:34.752 --> 13:35.987
I know you.

13:36.056 --> 13:37.988
You're
the Fletcher's Mattress girl.

13:38.056 --> 13:39.518
You're even prettier
in person.

13:39.587 --> 13:41.390
Thank you, that's so sweet.

13:41.459 --> 13:43.894
You know, she's also
the Muffinland Bakery Queen.

13:43.963 --> 13:45.564
Um, could I get a selfie?

13:45.633 --> 13:46.697
- <i> Is this a joke?</i>

13:46.766 --> 13:48.095
I think it's for the best.

13:48.164 --> 13:49.494
You think it's best to dump me

13:49.563 --> 13:51.100
the night before
my sister's wedding?

13:51.169 --> 13:52.966
We have had
a beautiful adventure

13:53.035 --> 13:54.202
the last few months.

13:54.271 --> 13:56.336
But before
things get complicated,

13:56.404 --> 13:58.072
you know,
with meeting the family

13:58.141 --> 14:00.039
and seating assignments and...

14:00.308 --> 14:01.748
Uh, I don't want to be a dick.

14:01.817 --> 14:03.047
Oh, you don't want
to be a dick?

14:03.216 --> 14:05.214
Well, that's exactly
what you're being, Kip.

14:05.283 --> 14:06.914
-You're being a dick.
-Whoa.

14:06.982 --> 14:08.351
Okay. Um, look,

14:08.419 --> 14:11.051
I know that my assistant
messed up the reservation.

14:11.119 --> 14:12.791
La Boucherie, Bennigan's.

14:12.860 --> 14:14.561
We can still have
a nice dinner,

14:14.630 --> 14:15.894
even though it's not French.

14:15.963 --> 14:17.293
No, we can't have
a nice dinner, Kip.

14:17.362 --> 14:20.164
Okay? And what, did you think
it would be nicer

14:20.233 --> 14:23.228
to dump me over truffle fries
and escargot?

14:23.297 --> 14:25.296
- One, two, three. Hey.

14:25.499 --> 14:26.938
-There you go.
-Oh, my God!

14:27.007 --> 14:28.740
-Thank you!
-Yeah, of course.

14:28.809 --> 14:30.007
I'm literally going to die.

14:30.076 --> 14:32.176
Oh, no! Maybe we can get
our drinks first?

14:33.679 --> 14:34.978
You're funny.

14:35.047 --> 14:36.642
-He's funny.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

14:36.711 --> 14:39.211
Are you, um... Are you
her manager or something?

14:39.680 --> 14:43.017
Griffin is actually
a brilliant lawyer.

14:43.352 --> 14:45.992
He's about to join
my uncle's firm.

14:47.692 --> 14:48.828
I am?

14:48.897 --> 14:50.094
One of the partners
is leaving.

14:50.363 --> 14:51.924
- <i> Margot, I meditated</i>
<i>on this last night.</i>

14:51.993 --> 14:55.293
And it came to me in a dream
the timing is just not right.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.830
But maybe in another life.

14:57.132 --> 14:58.631
In another life, what?

14:59.301 --> 15:00.598
-Reincarnation.
-Oh!

15:00.667 --> 15:02.435
-Yes, it's another chance...

15:02.504 --> 15:03.871
-Okay.
-...and that is on the way

15:03.940 --> 15:05.242
to nirvana.

15:05.311 --> 15:07.746
Wow, well, thank you so much,
Kurt Cobain.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.277
That's not the right Nirvana.

15:09.346 --> 15:10.576
And that's what
I'm talking about.

15:10.645 --> 15:12.314
-It's just, something's not...

15:12.383 --> 15:14.087
What're you doing?
You're overreacting.

15:14.156 --> 15:15.920
-Come on, sit down.
-You think I'm overreacting?

15:15.989 --> 15:18.321
Okay,
this is not overreacting.

15:18.991 --> 15:20.622
This would be overreacting!

15:20.690 --> 15:24.330
Peach on the Beach.
What do they put in that?

15:24.532 --> 15:25.565
What is going on?

15:25.634 --> 15:26.558
It's been three months.

15:26.627 --> 15:28.628
What were you expecting?
A proposal?

15:30.669 --> 15:31.972
I mean...

15:32.870 --> 15:35.308
No.

15:35.377 --> 15:36.607
Oh...

15:36.676 --> 15:38.672
shit. Okay. Um...

15:38.975 --> 15:40.244
This is awkward.

15:40.813 --> 15:43.049
Okay.

15:45.817 --> 15:46.913
Margot, wait.

15:46.982 --> 15:48.615
Yeah?

15:50.922 --> 15:52.118
I am gonna need the tux.

15:52.186 --> 15:53.656
Do not call me.

15:53.725 --> 15:54.757
Ever.

15:54.826 --> 15:56.224
Ever, ever.

15:56.293 --> 15:57.322
-Again.

15:57.391 --> 15:58.891
- All right.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.334
Oh, my God,
that was so embarrassing.

16:04.304 --> 16:06.566
Babe? From the moment
that I saw your face

16:06.635 --> 16:08.367
looking up at me
from that park bench...

16:08.436 --> 16:09.834
Oh, my God, are you proposing?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.170
Um...

16:11.239 --> 16:12.371
-Yes.
-Yes!

16:12.440 --> 16:13.605
-Yes?
-Yes! Oh, my God!

16:13.674 --> 16:15.213
-Yes? Oh, my God.
-Yes, I'm so happy!

16:15.282 --> 16:17.181
Oh, my God, I love you
so much. Yes, of course.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.378
Now, can you please sit down?
Sit down.

16:18.447 --> 16:19.611
You don't want
to see the ring?

16:19.914 --> 16:21.417
Oh, I'm sure it's beautiful.
I'm sure it's beautiful.

16:21.486 --> 16:24.857
Just, um, save it
for the real proposal. Okay?

16:24.925 --> 16:26.290
-The real proposal?
-Mm-hmm.

16:26.359 --> 16:28.120
Tomorrow night
at our New Year's Eve party.

16:28.189 --> 16:29.321
It'll be perfect.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.556
But, this is perfect.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.798
Tonight. You know,
it's December 30th.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.128
It's a Reed family tradition.

16:34.197 --> 16:35.797
I love your traditions.

16:35.866 --> 16:37.002
I just...

16:37.071 --> 16:39.936
We are technically engaged.
Yay.

16:40.105 --> 16:41.270
Just do it again like that.

16:41.339 --> 16:43.804
Tomorrow.
And I will say yes, again.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.842
I... I don't want to do it
again tomorrow, you know?

16:45.911 --> 16:47.207
I just... I just did it.

16:47.276 --> 16:49.209
Here, now. I mean, almost.

16:49.277 --> 16:50.444
Griffin, I...

16:50.513 --> 16:51.643
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

16:51.712 --> 16:53.680
Like, you just got
your proposal.

16:53.749 --> 16:55.614
And then, me and my followers
can get mine.

16:55.683 --> 16:58.652
Well, I guess
the big deal is that

16:58.721 --> 17:01.958
I don't want our proposal
to be some photo op

17:02.026 --> 17:03.254
for your social media.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.630
It's about us.

17:04.699 --> 17:06.663
It will be about us.

17:06.732 --> 17:10.763
But I have a responsibility
to my public and my sponsors.

17:10.832 --> 17:13.201
Griffin, you know
I'm a professional influencer,

17:13.270 --> 17:15.106
which means that I get paid

17:15.175 --> 17:17.169
when I influence
other people's lives.

17:17.238 --> 17:19.743
Like, what I wear

17:19.812 --> 17:21.411
and what I eat

17:22.145 --> 17:23.843
and where I get engaged.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.448
There is no chance in hell
that I'm going to waste

17:26.517 --> 17:29.188
a once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity

17:29.257 --> 17:33.159
for Death by Chocolate
and Turkey O'Tooles, no.

17:33.227 --> 17:34.689
Wait, wait, come on.
You're gonna leave?

17:34.758 --> 17:37.289
-We just got engaged.
-Whoa. No, no. We did not.

17:37.358 --> 17:40.133
I am taking back my yes.

17:42.264 --> 17:44.698
-Hey!
-No, no.

17:48.469 --> 17:50.704
-Oh, great.

17:51.474 --> 17:52.739
-Thank you so much.
-What?

17:52.807 --> 17:54.245
-Thank you.
-- I don't work here.

17:54.314 --> 17:55.577
-Take me to Maple, please.
-No, no, no!

17:55.645 --> 17:56.516
-Can't hear you, sorry.
-- Great.

17:56.585 --> 17:57.748
Just great.

17:57.983 --> 17:59.746
This is...

18:00.380 --> 18:02.448
Ugh. Come on.

18:02.817 --> 18:04.956
-Um, did you see...?
-Are you looking for

18:05.025 --> 18:07.625
a tall, redhead, super rude?

18:08.061 --> 18:09.391
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I saw her.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.897
She actually just left
in my Uber.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.331
Oh, here, she gave me this.

18:13.399 --> 18:16.662
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah, sorry, she was upset.

18:16.731 --> 18:19.403
Great job, Bennigan's.
Great job.

18:20.841 --> 18:22.308
Uh, do you need help?

18:22.544 --> 18:23.705
Uh...

18:24.575 --> 18:26.107
Not unless you got
an engagement ring

18:26.175 --> 18:27.477
in your pocket.

18:28.044 --> 18:29.112
Uh...

18:29.381 --> 18:31.217
This is me.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.677
Good morning, Judy.

19:05.146 --> 19:06.814
- <i> It's almost noon.</i>
<i>Your sister's losing her mind.</i>

19:06.883 --> 19:08.618
<i>The wedding planner</i>
<i>is stuck in Vermont</i>

19:08.687 --> 19:10.619
<i>and the bridal shop</i>
<i>forgot to pack the veil.</i>

19:10.688 --> 19:12.484
<i>And the maid of honor</i>
<i>is still in bed.</i>

19:12.552 --> 19:13.786
I'm not still in bed.

19:13.855 --> 19:15.724
<i>Christ, he didn't propose,</i>
<i>did he?</i>

19:15.793 --> 19:17.689
<i>You got your hopes up</i>
<i>and you were wrong,</i>

19:17.758 --> 19:19.295
<i>and now you're falling apart.</i>

19:19.364 --> 19:21.098
I'm not falling apart.
No, Mom.

19:21.167 --> 19:24.734
I am not feeling well. At all.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.532
I don't think I should go
to the wedding.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.868
I could be contagious.

19:28.936 --> 19:31.076
<i>So, this Kip</i>
<i>is still your plus one?</i>

19:31.145 --> 19:32.543
-Yes.
-<i> All right, then.</i>

19:32.612 --> 19:34.039
<i>You need to shower yourself</i>
<i>in Benadryl,</i>

19:34.108 --> 19:35.975
<i>ice your puffy face</i>
<i>and get your butt down</i>

19:36.044 --> 19:38.410
<i>to the hotel to help</i>
<i>your sister get married.</i>

19:38.479 --> 19:40.613
Okay. I'll de-puff.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.117
<i>And you'll pick up the veil.</i>

19:42.186 --> 19:43.482
Yes, I'll pick up...

19:43.550 --> 19:45.918
We will pick up the veil.

19:49.764 --> 19:51.363
I'm in hell.

20:04.575 --> 20:06.443
-Surprise!
-Jesus Christ!

20:06.512 --> 20:08.507
I got Zara to loan us
an amazing suit

20:08.575 --> 20:09.776
for the party tonight.

20:10.011 --> 20:13.319
Sorry, am I missing
something here?

20:14.655 --> 20:15.820
Yes.

20:15.889 --> 20:18.555
Me, apologizing.

20:19.492 --> 20:22.460
Look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

20:22.529 --> 20:26.028
If you still want my "yes,"
it's all yours.

20:27.429 --> 20:28.596
Yeah, you know what,

20:28.665 --> 20:30.328
I'm really sorry too, okay?
I just...

20:30.397 --> 20:33.500
All I want is for you to have
the proposal of your dreams.

20:33.569 --> 20:35.206
Okay? And so, if that means

20:35.274 --> 20:37.070
that we monetize
the engagement,

20:37.740 --> 20:39.475
then, yeah, let's...
let's do it.

20:39.544 --> 20:41.974
-I support you.
-Oh, thank you.

20:48.021 --> 20:49.217
Oh, that... That...

20:49.286 --> 20:50.821
That looks so good.

20:51.190 --> 20:52.725
Uh, you're acting strange.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.619
Are you okay?

20:53.688 --> 20:55.792
Oh. Yes. Sorry, I'm just...

20:55.861 --> 20:58.727
I overslept and I'm gonna be
late to meet the guys, so...

20:58.796 --> 21:01.230
I just don't really see
why you have to go.

21:01.298 --> 21:02.532
Oh. Yeah. No, I know.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.202
But it's just like our
tradition since law school.

21:04.271 --> 21:05.467
You know,
Sam's family is Russian.

21:05.536 --> 21:07.069
They just love
bathhouses, so...

21:07.138 --> 21:08.273
Yeah.

21:08.509 --> 21:11.075
And you know that
I love traditions, but, uh,

21:11.143 --> 21:12.944
traditions can change.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.014
I have to pee.
Try on the suit.

21:15.450 --> 21:18.117
Hey, babe, two drink maximum
tonight. Okay?

21:18.186 --> 21:19.515
Remember,
vodka is not your friend.

21:19.584 --> 21:20.979
Vodka's not my friend.
You got it.

21:21.048 --> 21:22.848
Hey, how about
I just try this on later.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.352
And then,
you could be surprised. Huh?

21:24.421 --> 21:26.557
Did you use my toothbrush?

21:27.125 --> 21:28.386
Uh, no, why?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.657
It's wet.

21:29.725 --> 21:31.123
Oh, well, I mean,
I took a shower.

21:31.192 --> 21:32.827
So, I probably just splashed
on it or something.

21:32.895 --> 21:35.564
Hmm. I leave it here
because I trust you.

21:35.633 --> 21:38.229
And relationships
are built on trust.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.403
Uh, don't you think
it's weird that you kiss me,

21:40.471 --> 21:41.805
but I can't use
your toothbrush?

21:41.874 --> 21:42.902
No.

21:42.971 --> 21:45.002
Some things
aren't meant to be shared.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.778
-Oral hygiene is one of them.
-Oh.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.476
<i>Davai, davai!</i>

21:51.544 --> 21:52.680
<i>Davai!</i>

21:54.455 --> 21:56.253
She said "yes"?
And then she said "no"?

21:56.322 --> 21:59.552
Yes. But it's a yes, I think.

21:59.621 --> 22:00.853
Maybe she changed her mind

22:00.922 --> 22:04.030
about marrying
a lowly public defender.

22:04.099 --> 22:06.225
No, wrong. She supports me.

22:06.293 --> 22:08.962
She just thinks I should make
a move into corporate.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.096
You hate corporate.

22:12.106 --> 22:13.237
I don't hate corporate.

22:13.306 --> 22:14.370
Are you leaving the office?

22:14.439 --> 22:16.240
No, I mean, it's just a maybe.

22:16.309 --> 22:17.706
Clementine's uncle has a firm.

22:17.775 --> 22:19.276
So, she just wants
me to consider it.

22:19.345 --> 22:21.346
Hey, buddy. What do you want?

22:21.415 --> 22:22.907
Listen, I'm getting
what I want, okay?

22:22.976 --> 22:24.415
I'm getting...
I'm getting her.

22:24.484 --> 22:26.647
Tonight, I'm making it
official, again.

22:26.716 --> 22:28.146
-You're getting married?
-Yeah.

22:29.951 --> 22:31.684
- Yes,
a little to celebrate.

22:31.753 --> 22:33.724
- Oh, no, no, no. No.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.723
I told Clementine I'm not
gonna drink today, so...

22:35.792 --> 22:38.227
<i>Nyet!</i> Nonsense,
get up, get up.

22:38.296 --> 22:39.363
Up, up, up, up, up.

22:39.432 --> 22:41.499
You will get married.
We toast.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.128
This is the best vodka
in the world.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.568
My grandmother had this
at her wedding.

22:45.637 --> 22:47.433
You cannot insult
his<i> babushka.</i>

22:47.501 --> 22:50.140
Okay, I'm not gonna insult
anyone's<i> babushka.</i> One shot.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.471
- <i> Na zdorovie!</i>

22:51.540 --> 22:52.674
- Oh, no, no, no.

22:52.843 --> 22:54.278
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
All the way. All the way.

22:54.347 --> 22:55.715
-Smell, smell.

22:55.784 --> 22:56.576
Right.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.415
One more cheer.

23:00.483 --> 23:02.955
The beautiful Clementine!

23:09.326 --> 23:10.761
Ooh.

23:10.830 --> 23:14.130
- <i> Oh, my darling</i>
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

23:14.199 --> 23:16.164
<i>Clementina</i>

23:16.233 --> 23:17.369
Whoo-hoo!

23:17.438 --> 23:19.564
<i>-Clementina</i>

23:19.633 --> 23:21.705
<i>Clementina</i>

23:22.207 --> 23:24.605
<i>Clementina</i>

23:24.674 --> 23:26.406
<i>Clementina</i>

23:29.983 --> 23:31.213
Last one.

23:33.221 --> 23:34.982
-Whoo-hoo!
-Let's go!

23:45.027 --> 23:48.463
<i>Darling</i> ,<i> oh, my darling</i>

23:48.531 --> 23:53.499
<i>-Oh, my darling, Clementina</i>
-- <i> Clementina</i> ,<i> Clementina</i>

23:55.538 --> 23:56.602
- Thank you.

23:56.971 --> 23:58.938
I have to say
a proper goodbye.

23:59.007 --> 24:00.607
-Hey, put yourself...

24:00.675 --> 24:01.979
Hey, what's your name?

24:02.048 --> 24:03.115
Gevorg.

24:03.184 --> 24:04.278
Ah, that's my aunt's name.

24:09.151 --> 24:11.489
Okay, I love you too, Gevorg.

24:11.558 --> 24:14.025
Deliver her to 15 Maple Drive,
Norwood.

24:16.460 --> 24:17.925
15 Maple...

24:17.994 --> 24:20.263
-Go get her, my friend.

24:20.332 --> 24:21.633
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

24:21.702 --> 24:23.529
-Yep.
-- <i> Do svidaniya.</i>

24:28.770 --> 24:30.576
- <i> Do svidaniya.</i>

24:31.741 --> 24:32.937
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

24:33.006 --> 24:34.442
Maybe I should just call him.

24:34.511 --> 24:35.779
The guy just dumped you.

24:35.847 --> 24:38.410
He doesn't get a call.
He gets a beating.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.681
I'm sorry, you're not allowed
to have alcohol in here.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.182
What about a broken heart?

24:43.251 --> 24:45.089
Is she allowed to have
one of those in here?

24:45.158 --> 24:46.117
We're sorry.

24:46.186 --> 24:47.593
I thought this was
a place of healing.

24:48.496 --> 24:50.429
Look, seriously,
what am I going to do?

24:50.498 --> 24:51.792
I can't show up
without a date.

24:51.861 --> 24:54.193
How about him?
He seems fun.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.031
What?
The wedding's in four hours.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.067
-You can't afford to be picky.
-Forget it.

24:59.136 --> 25:00.803
I can't just pick up
some random guy off the street

25:00.872 --> 25:02.238
and bring him
to my sister's wedding.

25:02.307 --> 25:03.534
Sure, you can.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.841
Hey.

25:07.348 --> 25:09.244
Want to go to a wedding later?

25:09.313 --> 25:10.550
Uh...

25:15.884 --> 25:19.122
Uh, I have plans. Or I would.

25:19.424 --> 25:20.857
Of course, you would.

25:22.626 --> 25:24.296
- This is so stupid.

25:24.365 --> 25:25.764
I mean, what kind of a loser

25:25.833 --> 25:27.459
doesn't already have a date
for New Year's Eve?

25:27.762 --> 25:29.195
Don't answer that.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.666
Got him.

25:30.735 --> 25:33.870
He's free tonight
and he's cute.

25:34.436 --> 25:35.806
Perfect.

25:55.460 --> 25:56.625
- 15 Maple Drive?

25:56.694 --> 25:58.296
That's right. 15 Maple Drive.

25:58.365 --> 25:59.459
15 Maple Drive.

25:59.528 --> 26:01.733
$96.15

26:02.863 --> 26:05.968
Wait. Maybe $46.15.

26:06.037 --> 26:09.503
But it's fine.
'Cause it's New Year's Eve.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.637
You're supposed to get a tip.

26:11.706 --> 26:13.540
You robbed me.

26:13.609 --> 26:14.611
You robbed me.

26:14.679 --> 26:16.242
Okay, my friend.
Happy New Year.

26:19.354 --> 26:21.214
- Oh, shit. Oh, God.

26:26.655 --> 26:28.654
Come here, you.

26:28.723 --> 26:30.557
Oh. Oh, shit.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.090
Hi, Teddy.

27:01.693 --> 27:03.388
What are you doing up there?

27:04.529 --> 27:06.292
Why are you so dirty?

27:09.897 --> 27:12.838
Clementine! Look at you.

27:19.042 --> 27:21.043
We're gonna have
to talk about that.

28:50.971 --> 28:52.902
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

28:52.971 --> 28:54.903
-Well, I live here!
-I live here!

28:54.971 --> 28:57.375
-This is my bed.
-This is my bed.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.436
-Really?
-What?

28:58.838 --> 29:01.106
What a coincidence! We both
have a one-eyed teddy bear?

29:01.175 --> 29:02.842
-What? Oh.

29:02.911 --> 29:04.145
Why are you naked?

29:04.214 --> 29:05.984
I don't know, I guess I...
I took a shower.

29:06.053 --> 29:08.179
-I'm calling the police.
-Do I look scary? I'm naked.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.480
That's exactly what's scary.

29:09.549 --> 29:11.957
-Don't... Don't call the cops.
-9-1-1.

29:12.025 --> 29:14.024
<i>-911. What's your emergency?</i>

29:14.093 --> 29:16.389
There is a naked deranged man
in my house.

29:16.458 --> 29:17.990
-Not deranged, actually.
<i>-Does he have a weapon?</i>

29:18.058 --> 29:19.092
Do you have a weapon?

29:19.161 --> 29:20.498
Do I look like
I have a weapon?

29:22.568 --> 29:23.969
-Ow.
-Karma.

29:24.038 --> 29:25.735
That's what you get
for breaking into my house.

29:25.804 --> 29:26.966
<i>Ma'am, are you in danger?</i>

29:27.034 --> 29:28.268
Oh, I didn't break in.

29:28.537 --> 29:30.873
Jesus! I used the spare key
under the flower pot.

29:30.942 --> 29:32.911
Wha...
And how did you know

29:32.979 --> 29:35.140
there's a spare key
under my flower pot?

29:35.209 --> 29:36.374
Because there's a spare key

29:36.443 --> 29:38.016
under every flower pot
in Norwood.

29:38.084 --> 29:39.512
Ha! You're not in Norwood,
you're in Westwood.

29:39.581 --> 29:40.945
<i>Ma'am, can you please</i>
<i>repeat the address?</i>

29:41.014 --> 29:42.650
I am? Jesus.

29:43.152 --> 29:44.588
-Thanks a lot, Gevorg.
-Who?

29:44.657 --> 29:46.057
Who's that? Are you alone?

29:46.126 --> 29:47.253
<i>Is there another intruder</i>
<i>in the house?</i>

29:47.322 --> 29:49.688
Yeah, of course, I'm alone.
I think.

29:49.757 --> 29:53.093
Oh, no. I'm gonna die. This is
just like<i> Basic Instinct.</i>

29:53.162 --> 29:54.727
No, no, no. In<i> Basic Instinct</i> ,

29:54.796 --> 29:56.663
she ties the guy to the bed
and kills him with an icepick.

29:56.732 --> 29:58.965
So, if this is<i> Basic Instinct</i> ,
then I should be scared.

29:59.034 --> 30:00.301
Then it's<i> Jagged Edge.</i>

30:00.670 --> 30:02.601
In<i> Jagged Edge</i> , Jeff Bridges
is wearing a ski mask.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.372
-I'm wearing a towel.
-Then it's<i> Rear Window.</i>

30:04.441 --> 30:06.271
In<i> Rear Window</i> ,
Jimmy Stewart is in a cast,

30:06.340 --> 30:07.879
and Raymond Burr
kills his wife

30:07.948 --> 30:09.141
in a completely
different apartment.

30:09.210 --> 30:10.476
It doesn't even make sense.

30:10.544 --> 30:11.915
<i>Ma'am, do you</i>
<i>even watch movies?</i>

30:11.984 --> 30:13.181
I don't always
make it to the end.

30:13.516 --> 30:15.086
I don't know what's going on
here, but I'm harmless.

30:15.154 --> 30:16.848
-Okay? I swear.
<i>-He sounds harmless to me.</i>

30:16.917 --> 30:18.120
Fine.

30:18.522 --> 30:20.688
But if he dismembers me and
makes lamps out of my skin,

30:20.757 --> 30:22.125
it's on you.

30:22.594 --> 30:24.121
Just stay, sit.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.228
Don't bleed on anything.

30:28.468 --> 30:29.664
Oh, my God.

30:35.841 --> 30:37.269
-Here.
-Ow!

30:37.337 --> 30:39.373
-That hurts.
-You're welcome.

30:41.879 --> 30:43.744
-Not to be weird,

30:43.813 --> 30:45.681
but have we met?

30:45.750 --> 30:47.581
No, we haven't met.

30:48.117 --> 30:50.019
I... I'm a real-estate agent.

30:50.088 --> 30:53.052
Maybe you've seen my face
on a park bench.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.026
Mm... No, that wasn't it.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.997
Oh, my God! Last night
at Bennigan's parking lot.

30:59.699 --> 31:00.995
Okay, are you stalking me?

31:01.064 --> 31:02.765
No, oh, my God, no. I swear.

31:02.834 --> 31:03.965
I don't know why I'm here.

31:04.034 --> 31:05.768
But I live at 15 Maple Drive.

31:05.837 --> 31:07.836
This is 15 Maple Drive.

31:08.238 --> 31:11.376
What?
No, that's... that's crazy.

31:12.573 --> 31:13.911
-Oh, no, who's that?
-How should I know?

31:13.980 --> 31:16.179
Apparently,
this is your house.

31:17.647 --> 31:18.650
Kip?

31:18.719 --> 31:19.914
-What do you want?
-My tux.

31:19.983 --> 31:21.149
I texted you I was coming.

31:21.218 --> 31:23.185
I didn't get it.
I... I blocked you.

31:23.254 --> 31:25.385
-A bit soon, don't you think?
-Goodbye.

31:25.454 --> 31:27.753
Just let me get my tux.
And I'll be gone.

31:27.822 --> 31:30.293
The tux you were supposed to
wear to my sister's wedding?

31:30.361 --> 31:32.292
Yeah, it's a really nice tux.
And I have a...

31:32.361 --> 31:33.992
-- Fuck.

31:36.034 --> 31:37.765
-Um... Uh...

31:37.834 --> 31:39.166
Hi. This...

31:39.235 --> 31:40.765
-I...
-Who the hell is this?

31:40.834 --> 31:42.704
-I don't know. Who are you?
-I'm her boyfriend.

31:42.773 --> 31:43.975
Ex-boyfriend.

31:44.044 --> 31:46.276
We broke up
less than 24 hours ago.

31:46.345 --> 31:48.881
And there's already some
naked guy in your apartment?

31:48.950 --> 31:50.714
-I mean, how...
-We didn't break up.

31:50.782 --> 31:52.316
You broke up with me.

31:52.385 --> 31:54.580
Wait, you broke up with her
right before New Year's Eve?

31:55.181 --> 31:56.214
What a dick!

31:56.282 --> 31:57.483
I know, right? Thank you.

31:57.552 --> 31:59.858
The naked dude
is calling me a dick.

31:59.927 --> 32:01.190
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

32:01.259 --> 32:03.560
Trust me,
you should hope that I don't.

32:03.629 --> 32:04.522
Okay, no, no, no.

32:04.590 --> 32:08.000
You will not
threaten my guest.

32:08.767 --> 32:09.831
What is going on here?

32:10.167 --> 32:12.602
Are you drunk?
Is this all you?

32:12.671 --> 32:13.664
So, what if I am?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.301
You've drunken some rosÃ© and
you've picked up some loser.

32:16.370 --> 32:18.001
Actually, I'm a lawyer, so...

32:18.070 --> 32:19.309
You are?

32:19.511 --> 32:20.506
Ha.

32:20.775 --> 32:22.345
You don't even know what
naked guy does for a living.

32:22.413 --> 32:23.945
He could be a serial killer,
he could be crazy.

32:24.013 --> 32:25.314
I'm not naked anymore.

32:25.383 --> 32:27.112
Yeah, he can be naked
if he wants to be naked.

32:27.181 --> 32:28.382
In fact, we can be naked

32:28.451 --> 32:29.681
all over the place
if we want to be.

32:30.283 --> 32:31.518
What does that mean?

32:31.921 --> 32:33.355
It means...

32:34.821 --> 32:36.892
do you want to go to a wedding
with me tonight?

32:36.961 --> 32:39.130
- Wh... Mm... Uh...

32:50.108 --> 32:52.308
All right, okay,
I've seen enough.

32:57.914 --> 32:59.376
Goodbye, Kip.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.477
-Seriously?
-I mean,

33:00.546 --> 33:02.021
it felt pretty serious to me.

33:02.089 --> 33:04.819
Okay, no, I get it now.
This is a test.

33:06.357 --> 33:08.126
Fortunately, for you,
I went through

33:08.195 --> 33:11.993
a grueling heart chakra
healing this morning

33:12.062 --> 33:14.358
with my guru over Zoom.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.264
So, I am not about to lose

33:16.332 --> 33:18.295
the progress that I made
over this.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.571
-Okay.
-Okay.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.634
But, if I see you again,

33:23.010 --> 33:25.071
Sadeep is not going
to be happy.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.573
Okay, okay, enough.

33:28.382 --> 33:29.448
Goodbye.

33:29.517 --> 33:30.408
Oh, my God.

33:30.477 --> 33:32.678
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, no.

33:32.746 --> 33:35.015
I don't know
what came over me, I was...

33:35.084 --> 33:36.418
It's totally fine.

33:36.487 --> 33:38.416
But, you know,
I should get going.

33:38.485 --> 33:40.284
Um... Yeah, I was... I just...

33:40.353 --> 33:42.556
About the wedding...

33:43.191 --> 33:44.288
Oh, that was real?

33:44.357 --> 33:46.129
You probably have plans.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.327
I mean, yeah,
you could say that.

33:48.396 --> 33:50.234
Yeah, and I mean, who would...

33:50.303 --> 33:52.164
who would go to a wedding
with a total stranger

33:52.233 --> 33:53.503
on New Year's Eve?

33:55.274 --> 33:59.337
Um... Well, this has, uh,
been interesting.

34:00.140 --> 34:03.781
You see, my sister is getting
married in about two hours.

34:03.850 --> 34:05.483
And I'm the maid of honor.

34:05.552 --> 34:07.846
And that guy who just left was
supposed to be my plus one.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.584
And everyone was like,
"Don't get your hopes up."

34:09.653 --> 34:11.349
But, what did I do?
I went and got my hopes up,

34:11.417 --> 34:13.989
and it's $40 a plate.

34:14.058 --> 34:15.290
And if I show up alone,

34:15.359 --> 34:16.921
I'll have to sit
next to an empty chair

34:16.990 --> 34:19.657
surrounded by happy couples
and judgy relatives,

34:19.726 --> 34:21.327
and I'll be
the last girl standing

34:21.396 --> 34:22.828
when the band starts to play.

34:22.897 --> 34:24.598
And the first girl shoved out
onto the dance floor

34:24.666 --> 34:27.338
to catch that stupid
overpriced bouquet.

34:27.407 --> 34:32.472
And I mean, I would rather die
a slow and painful death

34:32.541 --> 34:34.541
than participate
in that humiliating

34:34.610 --> 34:36.312
sexist
<i>Hunger Games</i> tradition...

34:36.381 --> 34:38.715
You know? I just...
Aah!

34:38.784 --> 34:39.983
- Ah...

34:40.052 --> 34:42.718
Look, I, um... I really can't.

34:43.154 --> 34:44.552
I really... I really can't.

34:45.956 --> 34:47.055
No, of course.

34:47.124 --> 34:48.352
I mean, I sound psycho.

34:48.421 --> 34:50.195
No, no, not at all.

34:50.795 --> 34:52.164
Um...

34:54.296 --> 34:55.565
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

34:56.335 --> 34:58.729
- Oh, yeah.
It's my favorite movie.

34:58.798 --> 35:00.733
My cat's name is Cat.

35:01.509 --> 35:02.367
Mine too.

35:02.435 --> 35:03.635
You have a cat named Cat?

35:03.704 --> 35:05.574
No, uh,
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

35:05.643 --> 35:07.777
I have a<i> Breakfast</i>
<i>at Tiffany's</i> poster

35:07.846 --> 35:08.875
in my kitchen.

35:09.244 --> 35:10.776
My cat is named Ted.

35:15.982 --> 35:19.756
Well, anyway, um, thanks
for not calling the cops.

35:19.825 --> 35:20.851
Yeah, thanks

35:20.920 --> 35:22.386
-for not murdering me.

35:22.455 --> 35:25.494
Okay, well, goodbye.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.570
-Yes?
-Hey.

35:39.639 --> 35:41.840
Uh, I just, I forgot my bag.

35:42.709 --> 35:44.145
-Oh. Oh.
-It's right over there.

35:44.214 --> 35:45.645
-Sure.
-Thank you.

35:45.714 --> 35:48.684
Thank you
and I'm sorry about all this.

35:48.753 --> 35:50.355
But, um,

35:50.857 --> 35:52.349
yeah. Goodbye, again.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.953
Yeah. Goodbye.

35:54.022 --> 35:55.260
Forever.

36:04.898 --> 36:07.973
Okay, I just,
I'd have to leave by- 00.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.902
Yes! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:10.971 --> 36:12.737
-Thank you, thank you.
-It's okay. All right.

36:12.806 --> 36:14.545
-Thank you, thank you.
-Yes, yes.

36:15.515 --> 36:17.277
How are you gonna explain
bringing me to this wedding?

36:17.346 --> 36:18.913
I'm not. You'll be Kip.

36:18.982 --> 36:21.384
Wait, you want me to pretend
to be the dick who just left?

36:21.453 --> 36:24.016
Please.
It'll just be so much easier.

36:24.084 --> 36:26.454
And you could leave as soon
as the ceremony's done.

36:26.522 --> 36:27.985
Please,
you'll be saving my life.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.994
Does Kip have a job?

36:31.063 --> 36:32.493
Of course, you have a job.

36:32.561 --> 36:34.429
I wouldn't date
a complete loser.

36:34.498 --> 36:35.559
You're a commercial
contractor.

36:35.627 --> 36:36.995
You own your own company.

36:37.063 --> 36:38.534
Okay, well, I don't
really know anything about

36:38.602 --> 36:41.035
being a contractor
because I'm a lawyer.

36:41.104 --> 36:42.539
Oh, perfect.

36:42.608 --> 36:44.901
Don't you guys basically lie
for a living?

36:44.970 --> 36:47.004
-Here, you can use mine.

36:50.844 --> 36:53.147
- This is a 42 long.
I'm a 40.

36:53.216 --> 36:54.417
- It's Armani.

36:54.486 --> 36:55.885
Just keep your hands
in the pockets.

36:56.555 --> 36:59.223
Wait,
so if no one's met him yet,

36:59.292 --> 37:00.886
then why can't
I just be a lawyer?

37:00.954 --> 37:02.553
Because they already know
he's a contractor.

37:02.621 --> 37:03.788
Oh, and a black belt.

37:03.857 --> 37:05.429
-He's a black belt?
-Yeah, but relax.

37:05.498 --> 37:06.557
It's not like
you're getting into a fight

37:06.626 --> 37:07.859
at my sister's wedding.

37:07.928 --> 37:10.064
So, how long
have you guys been dating?

37:10.466 --> 37:13.734
Had been. Almost three months.

37:14.468 --> 37:15.900
Wait, three months

37:15.969 --> 37:17.436
and not a single person
in your life

37:17.505 --> 37:18.504
has met your boyfriend?

37:18.573 --> 37:20.312
He was busy. People are busy.

37:20.381 --> 37:22.281
Can we dispense
with the Twenty Questions?

37:23.476 --> 37:24.746
I need a zip.

37:25.182 --> 37:26.651
- Oh, yeah.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.781
Okay.

37:38.229 --> 37:39.597
I'm Margot, by the way.

37:39.666 --> 37:40.864
Griffin.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.533
Griffin?
Wait, your name is Griffin?

37:43.602 --> 37:45.630
Yes, like the mythical
creature.

37:45.699 --> 37:48.065
Part lion, part bird. I know.

37:53.577 --> 37:55.611
-- Uh...

37:57.912 --> 37:59.844
-We gotta go, gotta go.
-Yes, yes, yes.

37:59.913 --> 38:02.882
- Okay. Oh.
- Okay.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.183
Wait. Hold on. I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

38:06.251 --> 38:07.991
Yeah, you're forgetting
this isn't your house.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.427
-Come on!
-Okay.

38:11.529 --> 38:13.398
-Oh, come on.

38:13.466 --> 38:15.796
Come on, come on, come on,
baby, come on.

38:15.864 --> 38:17.327
-Come on, come on, come on.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.563
Yes!

38:18.631 --> 38:19.963
Uh, wait, should I drive?

38:20.032 --> 38:22.641
You know, that is
such a man thing to say.

38:22.710 --> 38:24.839
Like I'm incapable of starting
the car because I'm a woman

38:24.908 --> 38:27.107
and it happens to be
sub-zero temperatures outside?

38:27.176 --> 38:28.312
Good one.

38:28.714 --> 38:30.982
Or, perhaps because a DUI
will literally ruin your life.

38:31.050 --> 38:32.780
And I at least had a nap.

38:33.786 --> 38:34.852
Oh.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.285
Well, that's actually
very sweet.

38:37.354 --> 38:38.654
-Switch?
-Yeah, please.

38:38.956 --> 38:40.584
No! Well, hold on. I'm gonna
go around. I'm going around.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.954
Around, around.

38:42.456 --> 38:44.792
Jeez!

38:46.328 --> 38:47.529
We need caffeine.

38:47.598 --> 38:48.928
Wait, are you sure
we have time?

38:48.997 --> 38:50.495
Yeah, there's always time
for coffee, let's go.

38:52.167 --> 38:53.765
- All right, do you
want to tell me what happened

38:53.834 --> 38:55.606
with, uh,
Mr. Armani back there?

38:55.675 --> 38:57.969
- It's a long story.
Not that interesting.

38:58.038 --> 38:59.610
Well, you know,
if it's any consolation,

38:59.678 --> 39:02.579
I'm pretty sure you dodged
a bullet back there.

39:03.279 --> 39:04.714
What about you?

39:04.783 --> 39:08.048
Did you dodge a bullet with
Miss Ginger Spice America?

39:09.485 --> 39:10.954
Her name is Clementine.

39:11.023 --> 39:12.721
Clementine?

39:12.790 --> 39:15.753
Wow. It's not a name,
it's a tricky fruit.

39:15.822 --> 39:17.492
Tricky fruit? What is that?

39:17.894 --> 39:20.328
Tricky. Fake, looks all sweet
on the outside,

39:20.396 --> 39:22.597
all bright and orange.

39:22.666 --> 39:25.800
Then you peel it,
it's this dry sour pith.

39:29.309 --> 39:31.370
No. My...
My Clementine is great.

39:31.439 --> 39:33.676
Hmm. Great.

39:35.074 --> 39:38.083
-I thought you guys broke up.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.280
What? No, why...
why would you say that?

39:41.349 --> 39:42.787
Oh, um...

39:43.423 --> 39:45.586
'Cause she, you know,

39:45.655 --> 39:48.391
fled Bennigan's,
stole my Uber.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.088
Plus, you're on a date
with me.

39:50.156 --> 39:52.662
We're not on a date.
I mean, this is a favor.

39:55.067 --> 39:56.298
Yeah, I mean,

39:56.801 --> 39:59.801
you know, you're on a favor
with me. So...

40:00.500 --> 40:01.535
Mm...

40:02.138 --> 40:05.308
You know, I get it, it's fine.
You don't even know me.

40:05.377 --> 40:07.776
Let's just get this over with.

40:08.708 --> 40:09.976
Oh, it's left here.

40:10.044 --> 40:12.312
-Here. Here, here, here!
-Left where? Here? Jeez!

40:17.322 --> 40:18.848
Are you trying to kill us?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.824
A little notice next time.

40:25.698 --> 40:27.999
Why does it look like
the lights are out?

40:28.468 --> 40:30.366
-The sign says closed.
-No, no, no, no,

40:30.435 --> 40:32.029
this cannot be happening! No!

40:32.098 --> 40:33.536
I can't believe
they closed early.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.032
I mean, how could
they do this to me?

40:35.101 --> 40:37.070
Well, you wanted
to stop for coffee, so...

40:37.139 --> 40:39.271
I'm bringing a stranger
to my sister's wedding.

40:39.339 --> 40:42.008
Do I look like I make
good decisions under pressure?

40:43.049 --> 40:44.242
Let's break in.

40:45.011 --> 40:46.418
-Wait, what now?
-I cannot show up

40:46.487 --> 40:47.783
without the veil.
I will be disowned

40:47.852 --> 40:48.851
-after they kill me!
-Where are you going?

40:50.021 --> 40:52.283
- Oh! I can climb
on this and go in that window.

40:52.352 --> 40:54.890
Oh, my, God, are you crazy?
Burglary is a felony.

40:54.959 --> 40:56.920
What do you suggest? I don't
think there's a spare key

40:56.989 --> 40:58.288
hiding under the flower pot.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.027
Plus, it's not stealing if
it's your own property. So...

41:01.096 --> 41:02.733
Um, actually, it's called
breaking and entering.

41:02.802 --> 41:04.368
And you can get up to
three months in county jail.

41:04.603 --> 41:07.302
-Oh. Well, that's doable.
-Oh, my God.

41:08.439 --> 41:10.003
Come on, it's just a veil.

41:10.771 --> 41:12.375
-- Hmm?
-Well...

41:12.444 --> 41:14.043
Sorry, what? "Just a veil"?

41:14.112 --> 41:16.711
Well, yeah. I mean, it's just
like a piece of fabric, right?

41:16.780 --> 41:18.143
So, can't she just,
I don't know,

41:18.211 --> 41:20.277
find something else?
Like a towel or a sheet?

41:20.345 --> 41:23.146
Okay. You want
my sister to get married

41:23.215 --> 41:25.018
with a sheet
wrapped around her head?

41:25.487 --> 41:26.756
A pretty sheet?

41:28.457 --> 41:29.625
Okay, just move.

41:29.694 --> 41:31.693
Okay, there's nothing
you can say

41:31.762 --> 41:32.959
that's gonna
talk me out of this.

41:33.261 --> 41:34.661
No, I'm saying you're not
tall enough to get up there.

41:34.730 --> 41:36.865
So, just move. Let me do it.

41:37.366 --> 41:39.571
Oh. Okay.

41:40.303 --> 41:41.837
Thank you.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.941
Hmm, all right. This is...

41:50.977 --> 41:52.781
- Okay. All right, here.

41:52.850 --> 41:53.844
-Let me, let me help you.
-- No.

41:53.913 --> 41:56.182
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

41:56.251 --> 41:59.524
-Oh! Sorry, okay. Okay. Okay.
-- Yes. Yeah.

41:59.593 --> 42:03.359
Here we go, okay, okay.
Okay. Here we go.

42:03.428 --> 42:05.026
-Almost. Yeah.
-Go. Go.

42:05.094 --> 42:08.364
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, that's my head.

42:10.598 --> 42:12.635
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

42:12.703 --> 42:14.272
-- Oh! Shit!

42:14.341 --> 42:15.573
-Okay,

42:15.642 --> 42:16.938
-uh, what do I do?

42:17.007 --> 42:19.042
-What do I do?
-Just meet me around front.

42:19.111 --> 42:19.969
Okay.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.279
- Wait, wait, wait.

42:22.348 --> 42:23.709
What's your sister's name?

42:23.777 --> 42:26.217
Carrie. Carrie Hayes.

42:26.286 --> 42:28.917
-Yeah. Oh, shit!
-Shit.

42:31.218 --> 42:33.416
-I have the veil! Ha-ha! Yeah.
-My hero!

42:33.485 --> 42:35.588
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

42:35.657 --> 42:38.024
Oh, perfect.

42:38.093 --> 42:39.725
-All right, let's go.
-Let's do it.

42:39.793 --> 42:41.059
Oh, wait, one second.

42:41.128 --> 42:42.534
- Wait,
what are you doing?

42:42.603 --> 42:43.799
- I have
to leave some money

42:43.868 --> 42:45.899
because I, uh,
broke a display case.

42:45.968 --> 42:48.334
I'm a fugitive
with Mother Teresa.

42:48.503 --> 42:49.773
Okay.

42:50.606 --> 42:52.677
All righty. Do it.

42:58.011 --> 43:00.748
No. No, no, no, no, no. No!

43:00.816 --> 43:02.280
Don't panic, no.
It's just cold.

43:05.325 --> 43:06.591
-And dead.
-Try again.

43:06.660 --> 43:08.655
-Try again, try again.
-Come on, baby.

43:12.132 --> 43:13.291
No!

43:20.405 --> 43:21.805
- Come on, Uber!

43:21.873 --> 43:24.203
Well, someone has to
come by eventually.

43:26.373 --> 43:29.577
Carrie was right.
I am gonna ruin her wedding.

43:29.645 --> 43:30.946
Well, I mean, listen,

43:31.015 --> 43:31.975
if two people are destined
to be together,

43:32.043 --> 43:33.718
then nothing can ruin it.

43:34.419 --> 43:35.586
You don't know my sister.

43:35.655 --> 43:36.950
She would call
the whole thing off

43:37.019 --> 43:38.586
just so she could
hold it over my head

43:38.655 --> 43:39.855
for the rest of our lives.

43:39.924 --> 43:41.660
I'd say you guys
don't really get along.

43:42.425 --> 43:43.525
No, we do.

43:43.593 --> 43:44.993
We're just different.

43:45.062 --> 43:47.396
Her life is perfectly planned
and executed

43:47.465 --> 43:48.698
down to the last detail,

43:48.766 --> 43:52.667
and I ate expired yogurt
for lunch.

43:52.736 --> 43:54.706
Wait, that yogurt was expired?

43:55.306 --> 43:56.339
Jesus!

43:56.408 --> 43:57.941
Ever since we were kids,

43:58.010 --> 44:00.037
Carrie made me feel like
I could never live up to her.

44:00.106 --> 44:01.505
So, I didn't bother trying.

44:01.574 --> 44:04.441
-Okay. So, it's her fault.
-I'm not saying that.

44:05.144 --> 44:07.217
Okay, maybe I am saying that.

44:07.786 --> 44:09.083
I bet you don't know
what it's like

44:09.152 --> 44:11.523
to be a constant
disappointment to your family.

44:11.591 --> 44:13.922
No, but I am
like an only child

44:13.991 --> 44:15.955
to the world's happiest,
happy couple ever.

44:16.024 --> 44:17.994
Wow, does
Social Services know?

44:18.062 --> 44:19.795
-Okay. No, I'm serious though.

44:19.864 --> 44:21.360
It's like the bar
is already so high.

44:21.428 --> 44:23.635
And then, I'm like
their sole purpose in life.

44:23.704 --> 44:24.928
So, I'm just excited
to get married,

44:24.997 --> 44:26.397
so they'll finally have,

44:26.466 --> 44:28.135
you know, someone else
to focus on for once.

44:28.203 --> 44:30.201
Oh, are you getting married
soon?

44:30.270 --> 44:31.968
Well, I mean,
not tomorrow but...

44:32.037 --> 44:33.771
- Go! Go!

44:33.839 --> 44:35.273
Hey! Wait!

44:35.342 --> 44:37.782
-- Margot, wait!
-Whoa! Shit.

44:39.619 --> 44:41.849
- Excuse me!
- Margot!

44:41.918 --> 44:44.147
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Go!

44:44.216 --> 44:46.854
-Go! Go!
-Hello! Excuse me!

44:46.923 --> 44:47.921
-Margot, wait!
-- Wait!

44:47.989 --> 44:49.494
- Driver?
- Hold on.

44:49.563 --> 44:51.026
- Driver!
- Wait.

44:51.561 --> 44:52.628
Whoa. Whoa.

44:53.331 --> 44:57.627
Hi! Thank you.
Thank you, our car broke down.

44:57.696 --> 45:00.836
My sister's getting married
tonight and I am so late.

45:00.905 --> 45:02.234
- Okay.
I have got the boot,

45:02.303 --> 45:03.738
-Cinderella.
-- Ooh, your shoe!

45:03.807 --> 45:05.106
- Oh! My... My prince.

45:05.475 --> 45:07.143
-- Yeah, yeah, just...
-He's harmless, he's with me.

45:07.211 --> 45:08.338
-Oh, oh. Thank you, okay...
-Put your foot in here.

45:08.407 --> 45:09.777
-...I got it.
-Well, come on up!

45:09.846 --> 45:10.978
-- Really?
-Yes.

45:11.047 --> 45:12.244
- Cool.
- Thank you.

45:12.313 --> 45:13.851
- Hotel's like
three miles away,

45:13.920 --> 45:14.947
so, you know, we were
actually just gonna walk.

45:15.016 --> 45:16.415
But this is probably better.

45:16.484 --> 45:18.351
- Ooh, you're saving
our lives. Seriously.

45:21.795 --> 45:23.955
So, what brings
you both out tonight?

45:24.023 --> 45:25.457
It's our anniversary.

45:25.526 --> 45:27.729
Always take my bride to dinner
on New Year's Eve.

45:27.798 --> 45:28.794
-- Aw!

45:28.863 --> 45:29.927
Happy anniversary!

45:29.996 --> 45:31.429
Fifty-eight years.

45:31.497 --> 45:34.431
And he is still the most
romantic man I ever met.

45:34.500 --> 45:38.542
Fifty-eight years?
That's incredible!

45:38.611 --> 45:40.005
So is your coat, by the way.

45:40.074 --> 45:42.012
Ooh, this is my lucky coat.

45:42.081 --> 45:44.845
I met the man of my dreams
because of this coat.

45:44.914 --> 45:46.079
- Because of the coat?

45:46.148 --> 45:47.649
Sounds like
there's a story there.

45:47.717 --> 45:49.553
Go on, dear. You tell it.

45:49.622 --> 45:50.888
Oh, they don't want to hear

45:50.956 --> 45:52.723
how a couple old coots met
50 years ago.

45:52.792 --> 45:53.922
-Yes, we do!
-What? Yeah, we do.

45:54.158 --> 45:55.959
-We definitely want to hear.
-- Please.

45:56.526 --> 45:57.729
Well,

45:57.798 --> 46:00.226
it was a drizzly,
gray October morning.

46:00.295 --> 46:02.062
I was taking the ferry
over to Manhattan

46:02.131 --> 46:04.097
to meet my buddy, Hank,
for lunch.

46:04.166 --> 46:06.031
So, the ferry pulls
into the port

46:06.100 --> 46:09.232
and I see this beautiful girl

46:09.301 --> 46:11.809
wearing a carnation pink coat.

46:11.878 --> 46:14.239
-I was love-struck, frozen.

46:14.308 --> 46:15.979
When I finally
got my legs to move,

46:16.048 --> 46:17.847
I chased after her
but lost her in the crowd.

46:17.916 --> 46:19.213
-Wait, you lost her?
-You lost her?

46:19.282 --> 46:22.116
I was crushed. I figured
I'd go see a matinee.

46:22.185 --> 46:24.620
So, I walked over
to the Astor on Broadway.

46:24.688 --> 46:25.889
And would you believe it?

46:25.958 --> 46:27.859
Who walks in
and sits one seat over?

46:27.927 --> 46:30.525
But the girl
in the carnation pink coat.

46:31.662 --> 46:32.693
-Come on!
-No way!

46:32.762 --> 46:34.096
So, the movie ends

46:34.165 --> 46:35.593
and I follow her into
the lobby and ask her,

46:35.662 --> 46:38.669
would she like to go
have a piece of pie with me?

46:38.737 --> 46:40.096
-She said, "No."
-- "No"?

46:40.165 --> 46:41.471
- I had plans.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.902
To meet my cousin.

46:42.970 --> 46:44.238
- So, I asked her,

46:44.306 --> 46:45.741
"Would you please
give me your phone number?

46:45.810 --> 46:47.241
"And I'll call you tomorrow."

46:47.310 --> 46:51.211
Again, she said, "No."
Turned and walked out.

46:51.280 --> 46:53.443
-- Oh, no.
-You just walked away?

46:53.511 --> 46:56.149
Give a strange man
my phone number?

46:56.217 --> 46:58.084
My mother would've
had my hide.

46:58.152 --> 46:59.956
So, I go to meet
my buddy, Hank,

47:00.025 --> 47:02.894
over at Stardust Diner
on 52nd Street.

47:05.130 --> 47:07.492
<i>I walked in,</i>
<i>and would you believe it?</i>

47:07.560 --> 47:09.329
<i>Draped over the back</i>
<i>of the booth</i>

47:09.398 --> 47:12.336
<i>-was a carnation pink coat.</i>

47:26.049 --> 47:28.581
-That was that.
-- Mm.

47:29.251 --> 47:30.546
- Two months later,
we eloped.

47:30.615 --> 47:32.952
And that was
58 years ago tonight.

47:33.020 --> 47:35.454
Simply, a matter of fate.

47:37.026 --> 47:40.330
Wow! That's a beautiful story.

47:41.133 --> 47:43.596
Nothing like that
would ever happen on Tinder.

47:44.266 --> 47:46.971
I mean,
not that I'm on Tinder.

47:47.773 --> 47:49.202
Our son is gonna pick us up.

47:49.271 --> 47:50.401
Why don't you folks
keep the carriage

47:50.470 --> 47:51.776
-for the rest of the night?
-Oh.

47:51.844 --> 47:52.939
-Really?
-- Are you serious?

47:53.007 --> 47:54.374
That would be amazing.

47:55.877 --> 47:57.074
- Whoa.

47:57.143 --> 47:59.247
Here we are, folks.

48:00.048 --> 48:01.080
- Happy anniversary.

48:01.149 --> 48:02.981
Go on, dear. You take this.

48:03.050 --> 48:04.550
Oh, no, no, no. I can't.

48:04.619 --> 48:07.624
A pretty girl like you
can't be going to a wedding

48:07.692 --> 48:09.593
in such an ugly coat.

48:09.661 --> 48:11.194
Uh...

48:11.263 --> 48:14.265
Well, it's your lucky coat.
I wouldn't feel right.

48:14.334 --> 48:17.897
Dear, when the universe hands
you a gift, you don't say no.

48:18.333 --> 48:21.698
Well, okay.
Only if you take mine.

48:24.042 --> 48:25.603
-Look at that!
-- Thank you.

48:26.710 --> 48:27.945
- Well.

48:28.147 --> 48:29.376
-Lovely meeting you.
-He's a keeper.

48:34.420 --> 48:35.347
Oh, um...

48:35.416 --> 48:36.880
-What was the movie?
-Sorry, son?

48:36.948 --> 48:39.985
The matinee at the Astor.
You know, the day you two met.

48:40.054 --> 48:42.688
Ah! Audrey Hepburn.

48:42.756 --> 48:44.858
-<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>
-<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

48:44.927 --> 48:46.195
- Still our favorite.

48:48.763 --> 48:49.829
Wow.

48:50.432 --> 48:51.561
Will you take this
and just make sure

48:51.630 --> 48:53.400
you pay
for that couple's meal.

48:53.468 --> 48:55.033
I'll just come by
in the morning to grab it.

48:55.102 --> 48:56.233
Thank you so much.

48:56.301 --> 48:57.601
What did you just do?

48:57.670 --> 48:59.472
Oh, I just gave him
my credit card.

48:59.541 --> 49:01.072
I thought we should
treat them to dinner.

49:01.541 --> 49:03.873
You just gave a stranger
your credit card?

49:03.942 --> 49:06.044
Yeah, it's fine. I'll just
come get it in the morning.

49:06.113 --> 49:07.414
It's not a big deal.

49:42.649 --> 49:44.321
- Easy.
- Ah. Here we are.

49:44.389 --> 49:46.056
- All right. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

49:46.125 --> 49:47.517
Thank you so much, Sir.
Sorry, move.

49:47.585 --> 49:48.921
I'm coming with you.

49:49.457 --> 49:50.957
Thank you so much.
Happy New Year.

49:51.025 --> 49:52.360
Happy New Year.

49:52.429 --> 49:54.332
-- Thank you.
-Ah, thank you so much.

49:55.001 --> 49:58.464
Okay. So, Dad is Paul.
Mom is Judy.

49:58.533 --> 50:00.698
Remember, you build stuff
and you adore me.

50:00.767 --> 50:02.465
I have to get this veil
to my sister, okay?

50:02.534 --> 50:03.900
-Okay.
-Oh, hi, aunties!

50:03.968 --> 50:06.406
-Oh. Oh. Yes. Wait, Margot.
-This must be Kip!

50:06.475 --> 50:08.607
I'm glad you're here.
Sheila, Rita.

50:10.710 --> 50:12.445
Okay. Just make sure
that the buttons

50:12.514 --> 50:13.918
are all lined up perfectly,
thank you.

50:13.987 --> 50:15.150
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

50:15.219 --> 50:17.180
-I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
-Oh!

50:17.449 --> 50:19.217
You are two hours late!

50:19.285 --> 50:20.452
Yeah, we got the veil.

50:20.521 --> 50:23.026
-"We"? Is Kip here?
-Yes, Kip is here.

50:23.095 --> 50:25.129
-Oh.
-You guys have no faith in me.

50:26.061 --> 50:27.329
Where are your shoes?

50:29.669 --> 50:31.294
Um, Fourth Avenue.

50:31.363 --> 50:32.797
No, no, no, no, no.

50:32.866 --> 50:35.299
You cannot wear dirty
winter boots down the aisle.

50:35.468 --> 50:36.900
-Um...
-- Mom?

50:36.969 --> 50:39.839
Well, you could always wear
your grandmother's shoes.

50:43.210 --> 50:44.478
-Cute.
-No.

50:44.546 --> 50:46.182
I knew you were
gonna ruin the wedding.

50:46.251 --> 50:47.712
I think you are
an absolute disaster!

50:47.781 --> 50:50.952
Well, you know
what's not a disaster? You.

50:51.021 --> 50:52.454
Okay? You look amazing.

50:52.523 --> 50:55.318
And it's fine, I'll find Dana
and wear her shoes.

50:55.387 --> 50:56.652
Everything will be fine.

50:56.721 --> 50:59.225
Let's just get
this veil on you.

50:59.294 --> 51:01.659
Let's get you all situated.

51:01.728 --> 51:03.594
-Then just...
-- Yeah, I got you.

51:03.663 --> 51:04.931
-That's right.
-- Here we go.

51:06.237 --> 51:09.807
Okay, come on.
You look stunning!

51:09.876 --> 51:11.672
I'm really glad you're here.

51:12.074 --> 51:13.307
I'm so sorry I was late.

51:13.376 --> 51:15.112
It was just a debacle,
the whole thing.

51:15.181 --> 51:17.013
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Evening, ladies.

51:17.249 --> 51:20.782
Back-up wedding planner
at your service.

51:20.850 --> 51:22.016
I'm Flour.

51:22.084 --> 51:23.715
Not like the bouquet,

51:24.349 --> 51:25.755
like the grain.

51:25.824 --> 51:27.587
I'm sorry, are you high?

51:27.922 --> 51:28.986
Meh.

51:29.823 --> 51:31.760
-Little bit.

51:31.829 --> 51:33.327
Oh! Maybe a lot.

51:33.396 --> 51:34.593
-No, no, no.
-It's okay. It's okay.

51:34.662 --> 51:35.700
-No, no, it's not okay.
-It's all right.

51:35.768 --> 51:36.793
No, no, I'm freaking out.

51:36.862 --> 51:38.968
-You want a hit?
-Oh, I'd love one. Thanks.

51:39.037 --> 51:41.770
After the wedding maybe. Um...

51:41.839 --> 51:43.099
Cool, cool.

51:43.167 --> 51:44.976
All right, gonna go find Dana
for those shoes. So...

51:45.044 --> 51:46.342
-Please.
-Oh, I want to go with you

51:46.411 --> 51:47.673
because I want to meet
this Kip character.

51:47.741 --> 51:49.076
No. Mom, please,
there's not enough time and,

51:49.144 --> 51:50.378
you know, Kip is nervous.

51:50.614 --> 51:52.342
He doesn't need my whole
family pawing all over him.

51:52.410 --> 51:53.845
Do you have...?

51:53.914 --> 51:55.315
Nobody's gonna be pawing
all over him. It's ridiculous.

51:55.384 --> 51:56.615
- I just...
- Yeah.

51:56.684 --> 51:57.787
- That doesn't make...
Wait for me.

51:57.856 --> 51:59.015
Hell, yes. Rita, you can

51:59.183 --> 52:01.319
knock down a pony wall
without a permit. No problem.

52:01.388 --> 52:02.755
What about the electrical?

52:03.124 --> 52:04.359
Just pull it.

52:04.661 --> 52:06.523
Just take it out. Come on,
Paul, just pull that shit.

52:06.592 --> 52:07.623
- Isn't that dangerous?

52:07.692 --> 52:09.100
I mean, yeah, if you're, like,

52:09.169 --> 52:10.062
standing in a bathtub
or something.

52:11.463 --> 52:12.764
Oh, man, I love this guy.

52:12.833 --> 52:15.205
Hey, dude, marry Margot
so we can be bros.

52:15.274 --> 52:16.335
-- Whoa!
-And you can teach me

52:16.404 --> 52:17.975
all your moves, right? Hyah!

52:18.044 --> 52:19.602
Oh, oh, careful.
I'm dangerous.

52:19.671 --> 52:21.408
You're a martial arts guy too?

52:21.477 --> 52:24.347
-I mean, I dabble, you know?
-Oh!

52:24.415 --> 52:25.711
-For the cardio mostly.
-- Dabble?

52:25.780 --> 52:27.451
The dude's like
a third-degree black belt.

52:27.519 --> 52:30.086
Third, fourth. It's like,
who's counting at this point?

52:30.155 --> 52:31.386
-- Dude!

52:31.455 --> 52:32.617
- Well, for months,
all I've heard

52:32.686 --> 52:33.891
is Kip, Kip, Kip.
I want to meet Kip.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.226
Okay, Mom, you're being crazy.

52:35.461 --> 52:37.393
-So, tone it down and I'll...
-- Kip is here?

52:37.462 --> 52:39.763
-Yes. That's him, right there.
-- Uh, Kip.

52:39.832 --> 52:40.824
Not much to look at

52:40.893 --> 52:42.098
-but seems nice.
-- Kip. Hey, Kip.

52:42.166 --> 52:43.759
-Hey, Kip. Kip? Kip.
-Oh.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.168
-Yeah, hi.
-- That's Kip?

52:45.237 --> 52:46.434
Yes, that's
Margot's boyfriend, Kip.

52:46.769 --> 52:47.805
- Yeah, sorry. I wanted
you to meet my mother.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.403
Um, this is my mom, Judy.

52:49.472 --> 52:51.000
-Oh, my gosh.
-Dying to meet you.

52:51.069 --> 52:52.735
Hello, I've been dying
to meet you as well.

52:52.804 --> 52:55.346
-The black belt?
-Uh, I guess.

52:55.715 --> 52:56.808
Hold my purse.

52:57.881 --> 52:58.976
Excuse me.

52:59.912 --> 53:01.878
-How dare you show up here?

53:01.947 --> 53:05.249
You are a sorry excuse
for a man! Kip!

53:05.317 --> 53:06.587
I'm sorry.

53:06.755 --> 53:08.487
Not the reflexes I'd expect
from a black belt.

53:08.555 --> 53:10.826
Hey, Dana, stop.
This is not Kip.

53:11.495 --> 53:13.528
- Hmm?
- I mean... I mean...

53:13.596 --> 53:15.328
this is... this is...
this is not the...

53:15.397 --> 53:16.629
the Kip you thought he was.

53:16.698 --> 53:19.566
He's apologized
for doing that thing

53:19.635 --> 53:21.531
that you're so mad about.
Stop it.

53:21.599 --> 53:23.170
You mean, dumping you?

53:23.239 --> 53:25.268
You dumped my daughter?

53:25.337 --> 53:26.574
Dude!

53:27.613 --> 53:29.613
I did...

53:29.682 --> 53:30.575
Uh...

53:30.778 --> 53:32.980
-Not? I didn't.
-- He... He...

53:33.048 --> 53:34.518
He didn't.

53:34.687 --> 53:37.547
See, I... I thought he did,
but it was a misunderstanding.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.356
Yeah. Happens.

53:39.425 --> 53:41.488
How can you be confused
about being dumped?

53:41.556 --> 53:42.990
- Um...
- Ooh...

53:43.059 --> 53:44.161
Texting, Mother.

53:44.229 --> 53:45.524
- Oh, yeah.
It was the text.

53:45.593 --> 53:46.991
-It was a wrong text.
-Yeah.

53:47.193 --> 53:48.692
- It was an emoji thing.
- Yeah, you got it.

53:48.760 --> 53:50.830
Hey! Who's ready
to get married?

53:50.899 --> 53:53.101
-That's me. Hi. That's me.
-- Oh! Right on.

53:55.041 --> 53:56.206
Okay, you all saw that, right?

53:56.275 --> 53:57.907
-- Ooh, poltergeist.

54:00.910 --> 54:03.176
So, are you sure it's okay
that I'm sitting this close?

54:03.245 --> 54:04.412
Oh, don't be silly.

54:04.481 --> 54:06.181
-You're practically family.
-Okay.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.183
Mm. Thanks.

54:19.329 --> 54:20.991
-Sorry.

54:25.403 --> 54:26.500
I thought they were

54:26.568 --> 54:28.372
supposed to wear
matching dresses.

55:03.603 --> 55:06.206
Oh-ho, that's a good sign.

55:06.742 --> 55:08.310
-What's happening?
-- Honey, it's okay.

55:08.379 --> 55:09.574
I'm sure
it's just the weather.

55:09.643 --> 55:11.540
The lights will be on soon.

55:11.609 --> 55:12.810
Sorry, folks!

55:12.879 --> 55:14.485
Lights won't be back
anytime soon.

55:14.553 --> 55:17.120
-Power lines are freezing up.

55:17.189 --> 55:18.519
And we just blew a generator.

55:18.588 --> 55:20.384
- You...
You don't have a backup?

55:20.619 --> 55:22.588
Uh, this was our backup.

55:22.657 --> 55:23.855
We've got a team
working on it.

55:23.924 --> 55:25.494
I just don't know
how long it's gonna take.

55:25.563 --> 55:28.231
-- Daddy?
-No, not to worry, honey.

55:28.633 --> 55:31.134
I'll get you to the altar.
It's plenty bright.

55:31.203 --> 55:32.502
- No, no, no, no, no.

55:32.571 --> 55:34.269
I can't walk down the aisle
in blue light.

55:34.338 --> 55:35.932
I'll look like a zombie bride.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.538
-A beautiful zombie bride.
-Aw.

55:38.607 --> 55:40.537
Maybe, we can get
some candles?

55:40.606 --> 55:42.007
You know, just like

55:42.076 --> 55:43.676
-a few hundred or...
-- That's a great idea.

55:43.745 --> 55:45.809
Sorry, folks.
Building fire codes.

55:46.278 --> 55:49.619
We've got an expert builder
right here in the family.

55:49.688 --> 55:51.849
Kip knows all about
fire codes. Don't you, Kip?

55:51.918 --> 55:54.525
-Uh...
-Yeah, bro. What can we do?

55:54.894 --> 55:56.889
Um...

55:57.759 --> 55:59.390
-How about oranges?
-- Huh?

55:59.459 --> 56:00.861
Oranges, sir?

56:00.930 --> 56:02.999
Yeah, I mean, oranges aren't
against code, right?

56:03.501 --> 56:05.168
-- Huh.
-Where's your kitchen?

56:05.237 --> 56:06.763
Okay, I need some olive oil,

56:06.832 --> 56:07.964
a couple of kitchen scissors

56:08.033 --> 56:09.472
and a couple of mops,
all right?

56:09.541 --> 56:11.070
You three start
cutting these in half.

56:11.139 --> 56:13.539
And then, you start helping me
scoop out the flesh. Okay?

56:13.608 --> 56:15.446
Is this a Clementine thing?

56:15.815 --> 56:16.809
Actually,

56:16.878 --> 56:18.381
it's an orange thing.
Just trust me.

56:18.450 --> 56:20.577
You're obsessed
with citrus fruit.

56:24.687 --> 56:25.884
- No,
we'll save it for later.

56:26.286 --> 56:28.120
- Get these over to them.
- Do you need more?

56:29.023 --> 56:31.491
- Grab a new mop.
- Ah, great, thanks.

56:31.893 --> 56:34.198
- Yeah. Just start
cutting some more wicks.

56:34.533 --> 56:36.731
- Yeah, right here.
On the top. I'll get it.

56:39.263 --> 56:40.768
- How do you know
how to do this?

56:40.937 --> 56:43.172
Well, I once defended
a vegan chef for stalking.

56:43.241 --> 56:44.440
She was guilty as hell,

56:44.509 --> 56:45.771
but she taught me
how to make candles.

56:45.840 --> 56:48.275
And my spelt muffins
are to die!

56:48.343 --> 56:49.778
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

56:49.847 --> 56:51.941
-- All right.
-Yeah, try lighting a couple.

56:52.010 --> 56:53.484
-All right.
-Here you go.

56:54.779 --> 56:56.212
-Hey!

56:57.551 --> 56:58.581
- This is great!

56:58.650 --> 56:59.919
- Thanks.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.540
We did it!

57:17.707 --> 57:18.971
-- Hey, this guy!
-Congrats!

57:19.039 --> 57:20.642
- Look at you,
saving the wedding!

57:20.711 --> 57:22.947
-Wow! Amazing.
-- I'm married!

57:31.223 --> 57:32.682
-Kip!
-I know!

57:32.750 --> 57:34.323
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

57:35.760 --> 57:37.620
- I know, he's the best.
One second.

57:38.189 --> 57:39.858
Hi, can we play
the other song?

57:39.926 --> 57:41.895
The one we talked about?
Thank you.

57:42.761 --> 57:43.795
I'm gonna come find you.

57:43.864 --> 57:45.067
-Okay. Yeah.
-Have a drink.

57:45.136 --> 57:46.163
Have so much fun.

57:48.102 --> 57:51.306
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

57:51.374 --> 57:53.174
My sister is so happy.

57:53.243 --> 57:54.375
And, I mean,

57:54.443 --> 57:55.904
you saved the wedding.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.644
Oh, no, you're so welcome.

57:57.713 --> 57:58.978
I mean,
I'm just glad it worked.

57:59.046 --> 58:00.317
I've never tried that before.

58:00.386 --> 58:01.380
-Yeah, right.
-No, I'm serious.

58:01.449 --> 58:02.784
Stop.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.184
-Well...
-Well...

58:11.057 --> 58:12.558
It's probably time
for you to go, huh?

58:12.626 --> 58:14.628
Yeah.

58:14.964 --> 58:17.166
But we should, uh, toast
the newlyweds, right?

58:17.235 --> 58:18.227
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

58:18.429 --> 58:19.996
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude
if Kip didn't.

58:20.065 --> 58:21.405
-Of course, yeah.

58:21.641 --> 58:23.068
I'm gonna go get
some champagne. Be right back.

58:27.673 --> 58:30.278
Okay, Mata Hari,

58:30.347 --> 58:31.880
who's the imposter?

58:32.483 --> 58:35.311
Just some guy I met tonight.

58:36.385 --> 58:38.147
Tinder? Hinge?

58:38.216 --> 58:40.750
-Christian Mingle?
-No! I, uh...

58:41.486 --> 58:44.221
I walked into my apartment
and he was in my bed.

58:45.324 --> 58:47.830
-Are you medicated?
-We have the same address.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.661
You know, I keep a spare key
under the flower pot,

58:49.730 --> 58:51.497
it's a very long story.

58:52.100 --> 58:56.573
So, this random hot man
appears in your bed

58:56.642 --> 58:58.406
and agrees to play
your ex-boyfriend

58:58.474 --> 58:59.973
at your sister's wedding?

59:00.905 --> 59:02.646
You think he's hot?

59:04.683 --> 59:06.815
I'm putting out
a spare key tonight.

59:07.516 --> 59:09.917
Nice to meet you, Kip.

59:11.115 --> 59:13.421
Hello, Veronica.
Small world.

59:13.489 --> 59:14.623
You know, it's funny.

59:14.825 --> 59:17.322
You look just like
a public defender I know.

59:17.391 --> 59:20.760
But he's about to be engaged
to a redhead mattress model.

59:21.063 --> 59:23.931
Yeah, I'm, uh, just here
helping out a friend.

59:24.667 --> 59:26.999
- Oh! Pretty friend.

59:27.068 --> 59:28.831
Future fiancÃ©
must really trust you.

59:28.900 --> 59:30.439
Yeah, actually she does.

59:30.508 --> 59:32.102
But, um, I would appreciate it

59:32.171 --> 59:34.572
if you could keep this
between us.

59:34.641 --> 59:36.609
Yeah. Absolutely.

59:37.078 --> 59:39.714
- Congratulations,
sister. You did it.

59:39.782 --> 59:41.877
-Love you, sister.

59:41.946 --> 59:44.981
And Kip is amazing!

59:45.050 --> 59:47.387
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

59:47.455 --> 59:48.658
Thank you.

59:48.727 --> 59:50.993
Who is that,
that Kip is talking to?

59:51.295 --> 59:52.691
That's, um...

59:52.759 --> 59:55.294
It's Brian's Aunty V.

59:56.030 --> 59:58.130
Wait. You gave away
my plus one?

59:58.199 --> 59:59.836
Yeah, but you weren't
answering your phone

59:59.905 --> 1:00:01.337
and I thought that you were
just gonna flake on me

1:00:01.405 --> 1:00:03.135
like you always do. So...

1:00:04.307 --> 1:00:05.334
Nice.

1:00:05.403 --> 1:00:06.906
So, you want us
to share the halibut?

1:00:06.975 --> 1:00:08.877
Yeah, we'll get you
some extra bread.

1:00:09.312 --> 1:00:10.377
That's...

1:00:10.446 --> 1:00:11.947
That's gross.

1:00:14.249 --> 1:00:16.580
You're staying for dinner.
You're staying for dinner.

1:00:16.649 --> 1:00:18.885
I promise it's the last thing
I'll ask of you this evening.

1:00:18.954 --> 1:00:20.288
But you have
to stay for dinner.

1:00:20.357 --> 1:00:21.283
Okay. Okay.

1:00:21.519 --> 1:00:22.787
-Okay, you're gonna stay? Yes?
-Okay. Yeah, no.

1:00:22.855 --> 1:00:23.855
-Yes.
-I beg.

1:00:23.924 --> 1:00:25.329
Yeah, please, just let me...

1:00:25.398 --> 1:00:26.530
Okay, but you're gonna stay?

1:00:26.599 --> 1:00:27.829
-Yes, of course.
-You're gonna stay.

1:00:27.898 --> 1:00:28.994
-Promise? Okay.
-Yeah, just let me...

1:00:29.229 --> 1:00:30.233
Okay, no, okay, but you're
gonna stay, yeah?

1:00:30.302 --> 1:00:31.801
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

1:00:32.170 --> 1:00:33.264
Hey, Clem!

1:00:33.333 --> 1:00:34.735
- <i> Did you just</i>
<i>hang up on me?</i>

1:00:34.804 --> 1:00:36.201
What? No, no, no.
Of course not.

1:00:36.269 --> 1:00:37.773
Sorry, there is just
bad reception here.

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:39.436
<i>Bad reception?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:00:39.505 --> 1:00:42.040
Uh, well, like I said,
I had to make a quick stop,

1:00:42.108 --> 1:00:44.173
and then
I'll explain everything...

1:00:44.242 --> 1:00:46.310
-Hello?

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.346
-Ooh.

1:00:51.850 --> 1:00:52.951
Hey, sweetie.

1:00:53.019 --> 1:00:55.559
<i>"Sweetie"? It's almost- 00.</i>

1:00:55.628 --> 1:00:56.624
<i>Where the hell are you,</i>
<i>Griffin?</i>

1:00:56.693 --> 1:00:57.825
- Kip? Kip, Kip, Kip.

1:00:58.027 --> 1:00:59.256
-Time for pictures.
-Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll be

1:00:59.325 --> 1:01:00.863
-right over there. Okay, yeah.
-Okay.

1:01:00.931 --> 1:01:03.326
<i>-I'm sorry. Was that a bride?</i>
-Uh, yes.

1:01:03.395 --> 1:01:05.335
<i>Your quick stop</i>
<i>was at a wedding?</i>

1:01:05.403 --> 1:01:06.433
Um...

1:01:06.502 --> 1:01:07.537
Sort of. Yeah.

1:01:07.606 --> 1:01:09.569
<i>Whose wedding? And who is Kip?</i>

1:01:09.638 --> 1:01:12.004
Oh. Uh, me. I'm Kip.

1:01:12.073 --> 1:01:13.436
It's, um...
It's just a nickname.

1:01:13.504 --> 1:01:14.941
<i>I've never heard</i>
<i>anyone call you Kip.</i>

1:01:15.010 --> 1:01:16.344
Really? 'Cause, uh,
back in college...

1:01:16.413 --> 1:01:17.473
- Kip!

1:01:17.541 --> 1:01:18.645
...all my law school buddies
was like...

1:01:18.714 --> 1:01:19.914
- Come on! Pictures!

1:01:19.983 --> 1:01:21.284
Yeah, just give me
one second, okay?

1:01:21.353 --> 1:01:22.278
No, no, no. Come...

1:01:22.347 --> 1:01:23.820
Because I have to finish
this call, okay?

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:25.184
<i>-That was a law school buddy?</i>
-Um...

1:01:25.253 --> 1:01:26.622
<i>And Griffin,</i>
<i>what are you wearing?</i>

1:01:26.691 --> 1:01:27.989
<i>That's not the suit I got you.</i>

1:01:28.158 --> 1:01:29.791
Kip, we gotta talk
manufactured siding at dinner.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.124
-Table 14.
-- And we will.

1:01:31.192 --> 1:01:32.693
I promise you,
I'll be right there. Okay?

1:01:32.762 --> 1:01:34.128
Just gotta wrap this up, okay?

1:01:34.196 --> 1:01:35.959
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>are you staying for dinner?</i>

1:01:36.028 --> 1:01:37.996
<i>Griffin, we had a deal.</i>

1:01:38.065 --> 1:01:39.770
Um, yeah, I know.
Listen, Clem.

1:01:39.839 --> 1:01:41.630
This friend is having
a family emergency.

1:01:41.699 --> 1:01:43.301
And they just, they really,
really need my help.

1:01:43.369 --> 1:01:45.370
<i>Is this some kind</i>
<i>of genetic defect?</i>

1:01:45.439 --> 1:01:48.810
<i>You never say no to anyone.</i>
<i>Except for me.</i>

1:01:48.878 --> 1:01:50.809
No, look,
I'm really sorry, okay?

1:01:50.878 --> 1:01:52.278
You're gonna have to go on

1:01:52.347 --> 1:01:53.850
and then I'll meet you there
at the party late...

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:54.945
-- Kip. Come on.

1:01:55.014 --> 1:01:56.246
We're all waiting for you.

1:01:56.315 --> 1:01:57.916
Oh, you know,
I really don't need

1:01:57.985 --> 1:01:59.117
to be in the wedding pictures.

1:01:59.186 --> 1:02:01.687
Nonsense.
You're practically family.

1:02:01.755 --> 1:02:02.993
I'm really not.

1:02:03.262 --> 1:02:04.394
- Come on.

1:02:07.399 --> 1:02:08.929
Yeah, yeah, that's sweet.

1:02:10.297 --> 1:02:11.833
Oh, Margot.
Kip, Kip, Kip. Come on in.

1:02:11.902 --> 1:02:13.065
-Oh, God, no, he's fine.
-Dude. Dude.

1:02:13.134 --> 1:02:14.398
Do we, like, stick
our tongue out?

1:02:14.466 --> 1:02:15.831
-We're like, "Ahh!"
-Maybe less tongue.

1:02:16.167 --> 1:02:17.438
- <i> Let's do it!</i>

1:02:17.507 --> 1:02:18.703
One, two, three.

1:02:18.772 --> 1:02:19.838
And we jump!

1:02:21.308 --> 1:02:22.677
- <i> I was early.</i>
- <i> Okay.</i>

1:02:22.746 --> 1:02:23.911
I want to pinch your cheeks.

1:02:23.980 --> 1:02:25.178
I just want
to pinch your cheeks.

1:02:26.483 --> 1:02:27.950
One, two...

1:02:28.019 --> 1:02:30.282
-Here we go. One, two, three.

1:02:31.083 --> 1:02:32.548
- <i> Just us, just men.</i>

1:02:39.830 --> 1:02:41.192
Oh, that was so much fun,
you guys.

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:42.627
-You already got me...
-No, no. No.

1:02:42.696 --> 1:02:44.098
So sweet!

1:02:49.873 --> 1:02:51.071
-Kip.
-Come here, come here.

1:02:51.140 --> 1:02:52.370
-Jump in.
-Get in the edge. Just there.

1:02:55.078 --> 1:02:57.207
- <i> So, here's</i>
<i>to food poisoning.</i>

1:02:57.376 --> 1:02:59.144
If I hadn't gotten
those bad clams

1:02:59.213 --> 1:03:01.181
and ended up
in the emergency room,

1:03:01.250 --> 1:03:04.983
I wouldn't have met
the hottest nurse in town

1:03:05.052 --> 1:03:06.622
when I was at my very worst.

1:03:06.691 --> 1:03:08.721
- Well, he was green.

1:03:09.057 --> 1:03:11.521
-And adorable.

1:03:11.590 --> 1:03:14.629
-To food poisoning and fate!
-- Yeah!

1:03:15.231 --> 1:03:17.962
And thank you to everyone
for coming out tonight.

1:03:18.030 --> 1:03:20.099
It's always been my dream

1:03:20.168 --> 1:03:22.035
to get married
on New Year's Eve.

1:03:22.304 --> 1:03:25.072
And, um, to my parents
for footin' the bill.

1:03:25.141 --> 1:03:27.369
It's coming out
of your inheritance.

1:03:27.438 --> 1:03:29.474
-Dad!
-And to my maid of honor,

1:03:29.776 --> 1:03:30.879
my sister.

1:03:30.947 --> 1:03:33.277
Who will be late
to her own funeral

1:03:33.346 --> 1:03:35.046
but who really
came through for me

1:03:35.115 --> 1:03:36.682
when I needed her the most.

1:03:36.751 --> 1:03:37.987
- Aw.

1:03:39.453 --> 1:03:42.421
And to Kip, who until tonight,
let's face it,

1:03:42.489 --> 1:03:44.824
I don't think any of us
believed you existed.

1:03:44.893 --> 1:03:46.323
-I know.

1:03:46.392 --> 1:03:49.592
But who really saved
the wedding.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:52.298
-Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.
-Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.

1:03:52.366 --> 1:03:53.936
-Okay. Oh, stop.
-No, stop. Stop, stop. Okay.

1:03:54.005 --> 1:03:55.901
-- Speech.
-- Kip, Kip, Kip, Kip.

1:03:55.970 --> 1:03:57.269
-Speech.
-No, no, no.

1:03:57.338 --> 1:03:59.005
I mean,
I'm just happy I could help.

1:03:59.074 --> 1:04:01.377
I want to hear
how you two met.

1:04:01.446 --> 1:04:02.946
Ah! Me too.

1:04:03.014 --> 1:04:04.845
Ah, no. This is Carrie
and Brian's night.

1:04:04.914 --> 1:04:06.045
You know? It's not about us.

1:04:06.114 --> 1:04:08.677
Yes, to Carrie and Brian!
Whoo!

1:04:08.746 --> 1:04:10.420
-Oh, no. That's okay.
-It's all yours, bro.

1:04:10.489 --> 1:04:11.515
- That's okay.

1:04:12.082 --> 1:04:13.554
All right.

1:04:13.623 --> 1:04:14.851
Okay.

1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:15.956
Okay.

1:04:16.025 --> 1:04:17.723
-How did we meet?
-How we met!

1:04:18.996 --> 1:04:20.860
-Um... Well...

1:04:25.002 --> 1:04:29.236
It was a chilly,
gray October morning.

1:04:30.239 --> 1:04:32.606
And I was taking the ferry
into the city

1:04:32.675 --> 1:04:33.705
to meet a friend,

1:04:33.974 --> 1:04:35.405
when I looked down

1:04:35.741 --> 1:04:40.143
and I see the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen

1:04:40.546 --> 1:04:43.213
in this incredible
carnation pink coat.

1:04:43.282 --> 1:04:44.783
- She wore it tonight.

1:04:44.985 --> 1:04:46.319
It's vintage.

1:04:46.388 --> 1:04:49.421
And I guess you could say
I caught her by surprise.

1:04:50.055 --> 1:04:51.156
Yes.

1:04:51.225 --> 1:04:53.691
And from
that moment on, it's...

1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:56.498
it's been
a non-stop adventure.

1:04:56.867 --> 1:04:58.868
I've scaled tall buildings,

1:04:58.937 --> 1:05:01.266
I've braved snow
by steed and carriage.

1:05:01.334 --> 1:05:03.501
I built fire
and saved the day.

1:05:06.107 --> 1:05:08.410
When I'm with her, I just...

1:05:09.881 --> 1:05:11.612
...I feel like
I'm a superhero.

1:05:12.381 --> 1:05:15.645
Let's just say that
from the moment we met,

1:05:16.952 --> 1:05:19.055
I felt like I was home.

1:05:22.286 --> 1:05:24.159
So, uh, to Margot!

1:05:24.892 --> 1:05:26.562
- To Margot!

1:05:27.692 --> 1:05:29.125
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

1:05:29.194 --> 1:05:30.829
Jesus, that was amazing!

1:05:31.198 --> 1:05:32.936
Even if it was all bullshit.

1:05:33.005 --> 1:05:35.368
Most romantic bullshit
I ever heard.

1:05:36.437 --> 1:05:38.067
That was an impressive speech,
Counselor.

1:05:38.136 --> 1:05:39.304
- Mm.

1:05:39.373 --> 1:05:42.308
Thanks. It was
surprisingly effortless.

1:05:42.377 --> 1:05:44.744
-Hmm.
-Don't let this one get away.

1:05:44.813 --> 1:05:46.579
Real subtle, Dad.

1:05:47.248 --> 1:05:50.416
But seriously, thank you.
I owe ya.

1:05:50.852 --> 1:05:52.616
Yeah, you do.

1:06:07.631 --> 1:06:08.971
Did you tell them
to play this?

1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:10.268
No, I didn't. I swear.

1:06:10.336 --> 1:06:12.039
-Come on.
-No.

1:06:12.107 --> 1:06:13.736
-Wow.
-Aw.

1:06:15.145 --> 1:06:17.274
Don't forget
to email me that bid.

1:06:17.343 --> 1:06:19.043
Oh, yeah. You got it, Rita.

1:06:19.512 --> 1:06:21.679
Are you taking side jobs
with my aunts?

1:06:21.748 --> 1:06:24.721
Yeah, well, they're having
some foundation issues.

1:06:24.790 --> 1:06:26.221
-Mm.
-It's complicated.

1:06:26.657 --> 1:06:27.822
Contractor stuff.

1:06:27.890 --> 1:06:29.422
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:57.952 --> 1:06:59.254
- Margot.

1:06:59.721 --> 1:07:00.756
Kip?

1:07:00.825 --> 1:07:03.225
Kip? I thought he was Kip.

1:07:04.928 --> 1:07:06.195
Well, don't look at me.

1:07:06.263 --> 1:07:07.659
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean,

1:07:07.728 --> 1:07:09.195
what am I doing here?
I texted you I was coming.

1:07:09.264 --> 1:07:10.595
Okay, I told you
I blocked you.

1:07:10.664 --> 1:07:13.695
My God!
You look so beautiful, I...

1:07:13.764 --> 1:07:15.266
-Okay, okay.
-Listen, no, no, no.

1:07:15.335 --> 1:07:16.634
You ever heard of the saying,

1:07:16.703 --> 1:07:18.139
"You don't know what you have
till it's gone"?

1:07:18.208 --> 1:07:19.204
Have you ever heard
the saying,

1:07:19.273 --> 1:07:20.539
"Not the time or the place"?

1:07:20.607 --> 1:07:21.878
-I understand that.
-You need to leave.

1:07:21.947 --> 1:07:23.145
-Let me just talk to you.
-Look,

1:07:23.214 --> 1:07:24.681
this is so embarrassing.
You need to go.

1:07:25.083 --> 1:07:26.916
-Sorry.

1:07:26.984 --> 1:07:29.149
Hold on.
Is he wearing my tuxedo?

1:07:29.218 --> 1:07:30.516
-Hey, come on.
-- Margot.

1:07:30.585 --> 1:07:31.479
She already asked you
to leave, all right?

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:32.681
- Is he wearing my tux?

1:07:32.750 --> 1:07:34.287
-You're wearing my tuxedo.
-Yes.

1:07:34.356 --> 1:07:35.519
Have you ever heard
of the saying,

1:07:35.588 --> 1:07:37.127
"Never wear
another man's tuxedo"?

1:07:37.196 --> 1:07:38.689
You know, you've been
touching a lot of things

1:07:38.757 --> 1:07:40.295
-that are not yours.
-- Okay. Okay.

1:07:40.364 --> 1:07:41.459
-Guys, this is... Come on.
-I don't think so.

1:07:41.527 --> 1:07:42.892
- That is a thing.
No, no,

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:44.397
-this has nothing to do...
-Margot, it's okay.

1:07:44.599 --> 1:07:45.894
-This is between us. Okay?
-- Let's not.

1:07:45.963 --> 1:07:47.333
You cannot just steal
another man's clothes...

1:07:47.402 --> 1:07:48.565
Don't put your finger
on my chest.

1:07:48.634 --> 1:07:50.107
...steal another man's
girlfriend.

1:07:50.175 --> 1:07:51.371
Don't put your finger
on my chest again.

1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:52.102
- Or else what?
What you gonna do?

1:07:52.538 --> 1:07:53.869
-All right.

1:07:53.938 --> 1:07:56.443
Are you threatening me
with a deadly weapon?

1:07:57.311 --> 1:07:58.373
-Yes.
-Karate chop!

1:08:01.052 --> 1:08:02.548
-Forgive me, Sensei.
-Kip!

1:08:05.751 --> 1:08:08.023
-What is happening?
-He started it.

1:08:11.828 --> 1:08:12.860
- Kip up!

1:08:13.329 --> 1:08:16.731
Okay. So, you really want
to do this, huh?

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:18.466
I guess. Okay.

1:08:19.369 --> 1:08:21.029
She told you
I was a black belt, right?

1:08:21.398 --> 1:08:22.431
Uh, yes, she did.

1:08:23.769 --> 1:08:25.274
Griffin, Griffin,
he's not worth it!

1:08:25.343 --> 1:08:27.741
-- Griffin? Who's Griffin?
-I have no idea.

1:08:28.110 --> 1:08:29.377
But the new Kip is hot.

1:08:29.445 --> 1:08:30.778
- Brian, do something!
- Here we go.

1:08:30.846 --> 1:08:31.880
- Oh!

1:08:32.182 --> 1:08:33.783
- Okay.
- Hit him, Kip!

1:08:33.851 --> 1:08:35.848
Uh, Kip number one! Whoo!

1:08:36.150 --> 1:08:37.181
- Really, a shoe?

1:08:40.853 --> 1:08:42.324
-- Oh, shit.
-Are you good?

1:08:42.392 --> 1:08:43.660
Whose shoe is that?
You guys look beautiful.

1:08:47.463 --> 1:08:49.364
-Not the cake.
-Did we mess up the cake?

1:08:50.266 --> 1:08:51.330
-No, we're good.
-Cake's okay.

1:08:51.399 --> 1:08:52.530
-It's okay. It's okay.

1:08:52.732 --> 1:08:54.269
-Thank God. The cake's okay.

1:08:54.338 --> 1:08:56.101
- Guys,
you're two grown men!

1:08:56.170 --> 1:08:57.369
-Stop it!
-Oh.

1:08:57.438 --> 1:08:58.635
- You guys,
that's enough!

1:08:58.703 --> 1:09:00.069
-Hold on a sec.
-Yeah, try it.

1:09:01.411 --> 1:09:02.711
-Hey, not bad.
-- Pretty good.

1:09:03.707 --> 1:09:05.914
Did you just rip
my Armani pants?

1:09:05.982 --> 1:09:07.646
You just ripped my groin!

1:09:09.718 --> 1:09:11.413
Kip, we're done. We're done,
you guys. That's enough!

1:09:11.482 --> 1:09:12.917
I think we're done!

1:09:13.286 --> 1:09:14.420
- That's it, Kip.

1:09:14.489 --> 1:09:15.786
-- Go to sleep!
-Kill him!

1:09:15.855 --> 1:09:17.320
- Go to sleep!
Go to sleep, bitch!

1:09:17.389 --> 1:09:18.661
That's not how it works.

1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:22.759
-- You done?
-Yeah.

1:09:22.828 --> 1:09:24.900
This is like Godzilla
versus Bambi.

1:09:24.968 --> 1:09:26.731
We're done. For sure.

1:09:35.912 --> 1:09:37.614
Cake's safe.

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:41.482
Is that a ring?

1:09:42.249 --> 1:09:43.784
You're proposing tonight?

1:09:43.853 --> 1:09:44.919
Uh-huh.

1:09:45.122 --> 1:09:46.653
You guys literally just met.

1:09:46.722 --> 1:09:48.719
-Not to me, to his girlfriend.
-- Oh, shit.

1:09:48.788 --> 1:09:50.990
- Kip has
another girlfriend?

1:09:51.059 --> 1:09:52.860
Wow. What a dick!

1:09:52.929 --> 1:09:55.462
Oh, my God!

1:09:55.531 --> 1:09:57.663
You brought a fake date
to my wedding?

1:09:57.732 --> 1:09:59.564
No, no, no. He's...
He's not a fake date.

1:09:59.632 --> 1:10:02.764
He's just...
He's just not Kip.

1:10:03.067 --> 1:10:06.671
Oh, so not-Kip is in all
of our wedding photos!

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:08.538
-Dude!
-- I'm so sorry. It's...

1:10:08.607 --> 1:10:10.873
I was... I didn't...

1:10:10.942 --> 1:10:13.212
Congratulations, sister.
You really did it.

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:14.648
You restored my belief

1:10:14.716 --> 1:10:18.253
in your ability to ruin
absolutely everything.

1:10:18.322 --> 1:10:19.852
I'm so sorry. I didn't...

1:10:19.921 --> 1:10:20.923
Sorry...

1:10:20.991 --> 1:10:22.153
Hold on. Margot! Wait!

1:10:22.222 --> 1:10:23.788
Excuse me. Sorry.

1:10:25.527 --> 1:10:27.594
Margot! Margot.
Margot, I'm sorry.

1:10:27.662 --> 1:10:29.363
Sorry for what?
You didn't do anything.

1:10:29.432 --> 1:10:31.367
-I mean, this is all my fault.
-No.

1:10:31.436 --> 1:10:33.434
Look, I should have told you,
okay? I tried.

1:10:33.503 --> 1:10:34.898
-I tried to tell you.
-Tell me what?

1:10:34.966 --> 1:10:37.466
That you're practically
engaged to a supermodel?

1:10:37.535 --> 1:10:38.736
No, okay.

1:10:39.005 --> 1:10:41.111
-She's just a regular model.
-It doesn't matter!

1:10:41.179 --> 1:10:42.542
I mean,
it's none of my business!

1:10:42.611 --> 1:10:45.010
Carrie's right.
I'm a total disaster.

1:10:45.079 --> 1:10:47.747
I mean, what kind of a crazy
person brings a total stranger

1:10:47.816 --> 1:10:50.080
to one of the biggest days
of their sister's life?

1:10:50.149 --> 1:10:52.850
Well, I mean, in all fairness,
we did meet last night.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:58.490
Look, I'm sorry
I brought you into this.

1:10:58.559 --> 1:11:00.524
-You're so nice.
-No, I'm not.

1:11:00.593 --> 1:11:02.190
I'm not nice, okay? This...

1:11:02.259 --> 1:11:04.527
Like, what I'm doing here,
this is not nice, okay?

1:11:04.596 --> 1:11:06.402
This is really selfish.

1:11:07.068 --> 1:11:08.137
What?

1:11:08.539 --> 1:11:10.039
I don't know.
When I saw you the other night

1:11:10.108 --> 1:11:11.407
in the parking lot, I just...

1:11:11.609 --> 1:11:14.408
I felt something that I've
never felt before, and I...

1:11:14.477 --> 1:11:15.941
I wanted to wrap
my arms around you,

1:11:16.009 --> 1:11:18.447
and just tell you that
everything was gonna be okay.

1:11:20.177 --> 1:11:23.447
And then 24 hours later,
you needed my help, and...

1:11:23.516 --> 1:11:24.948
I don't know, I just...

1:11:25.649 --> 1:11:27.390
I couldn't say no.

1:11:28.455 --> 1:11:29.619
-- Babe.

1:11:29.688 --> 1:11:31.193
-Oh, God.
-Are you okay?

1:11:31.262 --> 1:11:32.259
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, I'm...

1:11:32.328 --> 1:11:33.326
What are you still doing here?

1:11:33.395 --> 1:11:34.560
What are you still doing here?

1:11:34.896 --> 1:11:36.663
Dude, it's over, all right?
She doesn't want you here!

1:11:36.731 --> 1:11:37.893
Don't tell me what she wants.
All right?

1:11:37.962 --> 1:11:39.435
-Okay, guys...
-I know she doesn't want

1:11:39.503 --> 1:11:40.699
some asshole
who can't make up his mind.

1:11:40.934 --> 1:11:42.338
-Really? I'm an asshole?
-Okay, you guys! Stop it!

1:11:42.407 --> 1:11:43.102
Aren't you, like,
engaged or something?

1:11:43.171 --> 1:11:44.236
That's enough!

1:11:44.305 --> 1:11:46.343
Griffin is leaving.

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:49.874
He has somewhere
very important to be.

1:11:51.378 --> 1:11:53.312
Yeah. That's right.

1:11:53.380 --> 1:11:55.985
I'm leaving. You win.

1:11:56.054 --> 1:11:57.285
-Congrats.
-Hey.

1:11:57.354 --> 1:11:58.885
-What about my tux?
-Kip!

1:11:58.954 --> 1:12:00.884
Do you know how long it took
me to get that tux tailored?

1:12:00.953 --> 1:12:02.355
- Enough.
- Oh, my God!

1:12:02.424 --> 1:12:03.860
I'm so sor... Did you want...

1:12:03.929 --> 1:12:05.021
You want your tux?

1:12:05.090 --> 1:12:06.759
Yeah, sorry, you should've
just said that.

1:12:06.828 --> 1:12:08.023
-First thing.
-- Oh! Here we go again.

1:12:08.092 --> 1:12:09.297
-Naked guy!
-- Griffin, stop!

1:12:09.365 --> 1:12:10.631
-- Right on cue.
-$2,200.

1:12:10.699 --> 1:12:11.628
-Okay, stop!
-$3,200, but who's counting?

1:12:11.697 --> 1:12:12.762
Griffin, what are you doing?

1:12:12.831 --> 1:12:14.162
I got to give
him back his tux.

1:12:14.231 --> 1:12:16.132
-It's $2,800.
-Is he taking his clothes off?

1:12:16.201 --> 1:12:18.567
-I swear, he's a nudist.
-This wedding keeps getting

1:12:18.636 --> 1:12:19.803
better and better.

1:12:20.106 --> 1:12:21.409
- It's, like, sticky.
- You can't go outside

1:12:21.644 --> 1:12:22.439
like that!
You're gonna freeze! Stop it!

1:12:22.508 --> 1:12:23.606
Fuck your cufflinks.

1:12:23.675 --> 1:12:24.808
-- Sir?
-What?

1:12:24.877 --> 1:12:26.343
You can't be naked
in the lobby.

1:12:26.412 --> 1:12:28.214
Sorry. Sorry.

1:12:28.283 --> 1:12:29.484
Thank you very much.

1:12:29.553 --> 1:12:30.782
I don't have any cash, but...
Sorry.

1:12:30.851 --> 1:12:33.184
Well, it's been
a little slice of heaven.

1:12:33.386 --> 1:12:34.417
- Yeah.

1:12:34.486 --> 1:12:35.986
Unforgettable.

1:12:37.562 --> 1:12:40.027
I guess I'll just pay
for the dry cleaning.

1:12:40.096 --> 1:12:41.427
Come on.

1:12:41.496 --> 1:12:43.064
Look, why are you even here?

1:12:43.634 --> 1:12:45.662
-I came to see you.
-You broke up with me.

1:12:45.731 --> 1:12:47.767
I know, and I made a mistake.

1:12:47.836 --> 1:12:50.968
Babe, just give us
another chance. Please.

1:12:55.111 --> 1:12:56.578
I need a drink.

1:12:57.443 --> 1:12:58.878
Sorry, my love.

1:13:01.819 --> 1:13:02.646
Damn it!

1:13:06.616 --> 1:13:07.952
Ugh. Shit.

1:13:11.126 --> 1:13:12.528
Fuck.

1:13:59.836 --> 1:14:01.003
Hey, man. It's me again.

1:14:01.072 --> 1:14:02.645
Uh, could you take me
to the bus stop?

1:14:02.713 --> 1:14:04.479
Sure. But it looks like
you forgot somethin'.

1:14:04.548 --> 1:14:06.610
Oh, yeah. The tux.
It wasn't mine.

1:14:06.678 --> 1:14:08.551
Not the tux. The girl.

1:14:09.649 --> 1:14:11.213
She wasn't mine either.

1:14:12.816 --> 1:14:13.915
Could've fooled me.

1:14:14.184 --> 1:14:16.823
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah!

1:14:40.013 --> 1:14:43.052
Hey, man.
You forgot your pants.

1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:46.655
Oh, man! I might do the same!

1:15:10.882 --> 1:15:11.741
Hey.

1:15:12.244 --> 1:15:15.585
I know, yeah.
I'm on the list. Griffin Reed.

1:15:18.222 --> 1:15:19.787
You good? Thank you.

1:15:21.787 --> 1:15:23.552
- His name is Griffin?

1:15:23.621 --> 1:15:24.787
I know.

1:15:24.856 --> 1:15:26.195
- Did you tell him?

1:15:26.263 --> 1:15:27.592
No, I didn't tell him.

1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:29.194
Wow. Talk about fate.

1:15:29.263 --> 1:15:31.693
It's not fate! I wish people
would stop using that word.

1:15:31.762 --> 1:15:33.494
But you like him.

1:15:33.563 --> 1:15:37.904
So? He's proposing to some
model named Clementine.

1:15:37.973 --> 1:15:40.472
-Oh! Clementine Pratt?
-You know who she is?

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:42.005
I've seen her Instagram.

1:15:42.073 --> 1:15:45.077
She's got, like,
10,000 followers.

1:15:45.513 --> 1:15:46.781
- She's so pretty.

1:15:46.849 --> 1:15:48.749
- Well,
if he's so in love with her,

1:15:48.818 --> 1:15:50.945
what's he doing
at a wedding with you?

1:15:51.014 --> 1:15:52.281
He's a really nice guy.

1:15:52.349 --> 1:15:53.887
-No one's that nice.
-It doesn't matter!

1:15:53.956 --> 1:15:55.788
He's on his way
to propose to someone else,

1:15:55.856 --> 1:15:57.594
and the real Kip
came back for me,

1:15:57.662 --> 1:15:59.757
so everything worked out
just the way it should.

1:15:59.826 --> 1:16:02.197
Okay? There's your... fate.

1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:05.531
-- Yeah! It was fire!

1:16:05.867 --> 1:16:07.899
- Really?
I wish I was there!

1:16:07.968 --> 1:16:09.337
- Yeah,
you should have come.

1:16:09.405 --> 1:16:10.772
- I'll come next time.

1:16:13.805 --> 1:16:14.871
Better! Appreciate it!

1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:16.742
Wait, do you have my social?

1:16:17.044 --> 1:16:18.942
- Oh, yeah.
Your pictures are so great!

1:16:19.011 --> 1:16:21.013
-- Okay, baby.
-Hi!

1:16:25.086 --> 1:16:28.383
Hi, uh, can I just get
a whiskey neat, please?

1:16:29.724 --> 1:16:31.188
Hey, you're Clem's guy, right?

1:16:32.396 --> 1:16:35.028
-Oh, uh, yeah.
-Grover?

1:16:35.497 --> 1:16:36.727
-Griffin.
-Ah, yes.

1:16:36.796 --> 1:16:39.066
Griffin, the... lifeguard.

1:16:39.735 --> 1:16:41.763
-Lawyer.
-Ah. Good on you, mate.

1:16:41.999 --> 1:16:43.367
-Hi!
-Hey, babe.

1:16:43.636 --> 1:16:44.804
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:47.204
Look who decided to show up
to their engagement party.

1:16:47.273 --> 1:16:49.377
What the hell happened to you?
Were you mugged?

1:16:49.445 --> 1:16:50.679
What are you wearing?

1:16:50.748 --> 1:16:52.111
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Look, my phone died.

1:16:52.179 --> 1:16:54.182
It's just, it's been
a really long night, so...

1:16:54.251 --> 1:16:55.177
Yeah. For me.

1:16:55.379 --> 1:16:56.851
Do you know how embarrassing
it is to show up

1:16:56.919 --> 1:16:58.186
to your own
New Year's Eve party alone?

1:16:58.255 --> 1:16:59.214
I know. I'm...

1:16:59.283 --> 1:17:00.521
I had sponsors
waiting for our arrival!

1:17:00.590 --> 1:17:01.789
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1:17:01.858 --> 1:17:02.950
And what am I supposed
to tell Zara?

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:05.527
-I don't know. I...
-You know what?

1:17:05.930 --> 1:17:08.289
It doesn't matter.
I will smooth it up with Zara

1:17:08.358 --> 1:17:11.195
and you can wear them
for the wedding.

1:17:11.795 --> 1:17:12.827
Okay.

1:17:13.396 --> 1:17:14.665
Don't worry.
Everything's all set.

1:17:14.734 --> 1:17:15.935
-Okay?
-Okay.

1:17:16.270 --> 1:17:20.637
Please give it up for
the fabulous Clementine Pratt!

1:17:23.043 --> 1:17:26.813
Thank you! Thank you.
My goodness.

1:17:26.882 --> 1:17:29.210
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna sing.

1:17:29.279 --> 1:17:30.984
But I just wanted
to thank James

1:17:31.053 --> 1:17:34.383
for hosting
this incredible party tonight!

1:17:35.053 --> 1:17:36.352
I don't know about you all,

1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:38.526
but I have a feeling
this is going to be

1:17:38.595 --> 1:17:41.461
the best New Year's Eve ever.

1:17:43.196 --> 1:17:45.834
Babe,
I think you're on.

1:17:47.238 --> 1:17:48.331
- Okay!

1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:50.398
-Who's ready for the bouquet?
-- Hey.

1:17:50.467 --> 1:17:51.671
- Okay,
on the count of three.

1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:52.737
-Ready?
-- Okay!

1:17:52.805 --> 1:17:54.103
- Three, two...

1:17:54.172 --> 1:17:55.509
- One!
No, I'm just kidding.

1:17:55.578 --> 1:17:56.674
-What?
-Just one second

1:17:56.743 --> 1:17:57.910
before you guys do that.

1:17:58.213 --> 1:17:59.481
This is my favorite part
of the wedding, by the way.

1:17:59.550 --> 1:18:00.916
But I just have to do this.

1:18:00.984 --> 1:18:02.780
-What the hell?
-- I really appreciate it.

1:18:02.848 --> 1:18:04.081
Would you guys just mind?

1:18:04.150 --> 1:18:06.622
Many of you guys
don't know me, okay?

1:18:06.691 --> 1:18:09.887
But, uh, I am Kip.
The real Kip.

1:18:09.956 --> 1:18:11.892
And I just want to apologize

1:18:11.961 --> 1:18:13.594
for what happened
with the imposter Kip.

1:18:13.663 --> 1:18:14.795
I kinda liked the imposter.

1:18:14.864 --> 1:18:16.464
And I don't want
to steal the thunder

1:18:16.532 --> 1:18:18.026
from the beautiful bride.

1:18:18.095 --> 1:18:19.161
-Oh, no.
-- Yes.

1:18:19.229 --> 1:18:20.394
We wouldn't want
to do that. No.

1:18:20.463 --> 1:18:21.535
-- This has to be done.
-Right.

1:18:21.604 --> 1:18:23.036
This is very important.

1:18:27.244 --> 1:18:28.136
Okay.

1:18:31.644 --> 1:18:33.849
Oh, shit.

1:18:40.725 --> 1:18:42.150
You know,
whenever I imagined myself

1:18:42.219 --> 1:18:44.024
proposing to my future wife,

1:18:45.225 --> 1:18:47.623
I always knew
it would only happen once.

1:18:47.692 --> 1:18:50.798
When I imagined the man
of my dreams proposing to me,

1:18:50.867 --> 1:18:53.931
I wanted it to be
once in a lifetime.

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.232
And I'd never give that moment

1:18:55.301 --> 1:18:58.137
to someone
who I had any doubts about.

1:18:58.904 --> 1:19:00.341
Twenty-four hours ago,

1:19:01.043 --> 1:19:04.009
all I wanted was for you
to ask me to marry you.

1:19:04.077 --> 1:19:05.408
<i>Twenty-four hours ago,</i>

1:19:05.477 --> 1:19:07.409
I'd convinced myself
that you were the woman

1:19:07.478 --> 1:19:10.285
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.

1:19:14.754 --> 1:19:16.124
But that's...

1:19:16.193 --> 1:19:17.321
Changed.

1:19:19.894 --> 1:19:21.356
-- Um...
-What?

1:19:21.425 --> 1:19:23.998
I... I thought
this is what you wanted.

1:19:24.067 --> 1:19:26.368
-I can't. I can't do this.
-- What?

1:19:26.437 --> 1:19:28.032
I can't let you do this.

1:19:28.101 --> 1:19:29.966
I'm really sorry.
I... I can't.

1:19:30.035 --> 1:19:32.072
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:34.877
-Come on. Get up.

1:19:36.309 --> 1:19:38.172
Happy New Year, everyone!
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Here.

1:19:38.241 --> 1:19:40.113
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

1:19:52.524 --> 1:19:54.930
Just... Just stop
for just a second. All right?

1:19:54.999 --> 1:19:57.592
I know that I'm embarrassing
myself, but...

1:19:59.001 --> 1:20:01.232
I treated you terribly
last night.

1:20:01.301 --> 1:20:02.764
-And I am sorry. Last night...
-Yeah.

1:20:02.832 --> 1:20:05.337
The truth is, I have spent
the last 24 hours thinking

1:20:05.406 --> 1:20:08.141
that I've been making the
biggest mistake of my life.

1:20:09.011 --> 1:20:12.780
I... actually think
that I love you,

1:20:12.849 --> 1:20:15.483
and I...
I do want to marry you.

1:20:15.719 --> 1:20:19.147
You "think"? What,

1:20:19.215 --> 1:20:20.950
are you... are you crazy?

1:20:21.019 --> 1:20:22.352
You don't love me.

1:20:22.421 --> 1:20:26.256
And you know what? I...
I don't love you.

1:20:26.325 --> 1:20:27.862
I mean,
I had more fun tonight,

1:20:27.931 --> 1:20:29.998
a more honest,
genuine connection

1:20:30.067 --> 1:20:31.632
with a total stranger
than I've had with you

1:20:31.700 --> 1:20:32.899
in the last three months!

1:20:32.967 --> 1:20:34.767
Wow. Kick a guy
while he's down.

1:20:34.835 --> 1:20:36.834
I'm just being honest.

1:20:36.903 --> 1:20:38.268
You know it's true.

1:20:38.336 --> 1:20:40.910
And you'll bounce back,
I'm sure.

1:20:41.676 --> 1:20:43.078
Goodbye, okay?

1:20:43.146 --> 1:20:46.311
For real this time, please.

1:20:47.218 --> 1:20:48.280
Goodbye.

1:21:01.828 --> 1:21:03.526
Oh, my God.

1:21:12.035 --> 1:21:13.503
Okay...

1:21:29.659 --> 1:21:31.158
Ted, are you hungry?

1:21:33.228 --> 1:21:37.197
-Hey, buddy. Happy New Year.

1:21:38.832 --> 1:21:40.431
Yum, yum, yum.

1:21:40.834 --> 1:21:42.235
Good night, pal.

1:21:47.611 --> 1:21:48.736
- Wow, okay.

1:21:48.805 --> 1:21:50.738
So you're just sneaking out
of my wedding?

1:21:50.807 --> 1:21:53.776
I was going more
for graceful exit.

1:21:54.012 --> 1:21:55.949
Oh, okay. Right.

1:21:56.018 --> 1:21:58.914
Just, uh,
quick question first.

1:21:59.483 --> 1:22:01.889
-Why do you hate me?
-Hate you?

1:22:01.957 --> 1:22:04.052
-Yeah.
-I don't hate you.

1:22:04.121 --> 1:22:05.355
I worship you.

1:22:05.424 --> 1:22:07.630
-Okay. Come on.
-What? It's true!

1:22:07.699 --> 1:22:08.898
I wish I were more like you.

1:22:08.967 --> 1:22:11.165
I mean, you're brave.
You're smart.

1:22:11.233 --> 1:22:13.302
Everywhere we go,
everybody just adores you.

1:22:13.371 --> 1:22:15.801
I mean, you're marrying the
best guy in the world tonight.

1:22:17.707 --> 1:22:19.202
Your life is perfect.

1:22:19.271 --> 1:22:21.872
You think my life is perfect?

1:22:21.941 --> 1:22:23.310
Are you crazy?

1:22:23.378 --> 1:22:25.878
No, the only difference
between me and you is

1:22:25.946 --> 1:22:28.017
I go for what I want.

1:22:28.786 --> 1:22:30.481
And you're too afraid to try.

1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:34.089
So, stop trying to be me.

1:22:35.185 --> 1:22:36.686
Just go be you.

1:22:37.389 --> 1:22:39.523
-You're right.

1:22:40.389 --> 1:22:42.461
Thank you.

1:22:42.697 --> 1:22:43.557
Yeah.

1:22:43.626 --> 1:22:45.699
I'm sorry
I ruined your wedding.

1:22:45.768 --> 1:22:47.566
No. Hey, it's fine.

1:22:47.634 --> 1:22:50.098
You know, Brian said that
the fight already went viral.

1:22:54.304 --> 1:22:56.111
I love you, sister.

1:22:57.044 --> 1:22:59.114
I love you too.

1:23:04.117 --> 1:23:05.549
-Hmm.

1:23:06.451 --> 1:23:08.089
- Ten! Nine!
- Oh!

1:23:08.158 --> 1:23:09.320
- Eight! Seven!
- Um...

1:23:09.523 --> 1:23:10.718
-- Go. Go.
-Yeah, okay. But don't forget

1:23:10.787 --> 1:23:11.989
-brunch tomorrow.
-- Six! Five! Four!

1:23:12.058 --> 1:23:13.259
-Okay.
-Yeah?

1:23:13.328 --> 1:23:18.194
- Three! Two! One!
Happy New Year!

1:24:17.428 --> 1:24:18.787
Hi, Ted.

1:24:30.835 --> 1:24:33.604
I love what you've done
with my apartment.

1:24:38.681 --> 1:24:39.775
Margot?

1:24:40.877 --> 1:24:43.315
I rang the bell,
like, a thousand times,

1:24:43.384 --> 1:24:44.818
but you didn't answer,
so I just...

1:24:44.887 --> 1:24:45.983
I don't have a bell.

1:24:46.319 --> 1:24:48.883
Oh. I wonder what that was.

1:24:50.052 --> 1:24:53.158
Wait, hold on. So, what...
what are you doing here?

1:24:53.227 --> 1:24:54.692
Uh, you left this at my house.

1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:58.464
I thought it might be
important. Legal stuff.

1:24:59.197 --> 1:25:01.368
Yeah. Thank you.

1:25:07.439 --> 1:25:09.537
-You're alone.
-Um, yeah.

1:25:09.606 --> 1:25:12.148
And not engaged.

1:25:12.981 --> 1:25:14.442
-And...
-No...

1:25:14.511 --> 1:25:16.713
Wait. How did you know?

1:25:17.247 --> 1:25:18.412
Instagram.

1:25:18.681 --> 1:25:20.717
Ah, right. Yeah.

1:25:23.757 --> 1:25:26.259
Wait, hold on. So, you came
all the way over here

1:25:26.328 --> 1:25:29.726
at- 00 a.m.
just to return my bag?

1:25:31.063 --> 1:25:32.161
Yeah.

1:25:32.697 --> 1:25:34.566
Well, and to show you
something.

1:25:35.335 --> 1:25:36.766
You want to show me something?

1:25:37.574 --> 1:25:38.636
Yes.

1:25:43.911 --> 1:25:45.247
Unzip.

1:25:46.343 --> 1:25:47.682
Is this a trap?

1:25:48.018 --> 1:25:49.381
-No!
-Okay.

1:25:49.450 --> 1:25:51.385
-Just do it!
-All right. All right.

1:25:58.362 --> 1:26:00.959
The stupid things
we do in college, right?

1:26:02.765 --> 1:26:03.859
Um...

1:26:04.966 --> 1:26:06.400
That's a...

1:26:07.268 --> 1:26:08.663
-- A griffin.
-What...

1:26:08.732 --> 1:26:10.737
I have a griffin tattoo.

1:26:11.039 --> 1:26:12.307
You got that in college?

1:26:13.677 --> 1:26:14.537
Yeah.

1:26:14.806 --> 1:26:16.878
I had just broken up
with my boyfriend.

1:26:16.946 --> 1:26:19.246
I was a little drunk.

1:26:19.315 --> 1:26:21.916
And I told the guy
to surprise me.

1:26:21.985 --> 1:26:24.682
So... surprise!

1:26:32.461 --> 1:26:34.089
Oh, thank God,
it's not a Tweety Bird.

1:26:40.804 --> 1:26:41.901
This is insane.

1:26:42.437 --> 1:26:43.798
You have a griffin
on your body.

1:26:43.867 --> 1:26:45.206
If you have "Margot"
on your ass,

1:26:45.275 --> 1:26:46.835
I really am calling
the police.

1:26:46.904 --> 1:26:48.904
Oh, not yet,
but that's a good idea.

1:26:54.516 --> 1:26:56.016
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:26:56.084 --> 1:26:57.313
Oh, shit! Clementine!

1:26:57.382 --> 1:26:58.583
What are you doing here?

1:26:58.652 --> 1:27:00.019
You didn't even call
to check on me.

1:27:00.088 --> 1:27:01.686
What... We broke up.

1:27:02.222 --> 1:27:03.491
I want my Sonicare.

1:27:03.727 --> 1:27:04.552
What?

1:27:04.621 --> 1:27:06.053
My Sonicare toothbrush.

1:27:06.122 --> 1:27:08.429
I actually had to pay
for that. I want it back.

1:27:09.164 --> 1:27:10.594
-Now?
-Yes, now!

1:27:10.663 --> 1:27:12.627
Before you rub it
all over your mouth,

1:27:12.696 --> 1:27:14.134
or clean your toilet with it.

1:27:14.203 --> 1:27:15.764
Or let someone else use it.

1:27:15.833 --> 1:27:17.870
Yeah, okay, all right.
Just one second.

1:27:17.939 --> 1:27:18.967
Thanks.

1:27:21.811 --> 1:27:22.876
Wait.

1:27:22.945 --> 1:27:24.076
I know you.

1:27:24.411 --> 1:27:26.744
Are you the girl
from Bennigan's?

1:27:27.310 --> 1:27:28.446
Yes.

1:27:28.882 --> 1:27:31.386
-You stole my Uber.
-So, you stole my boyfriend?

1:27:31.455 --> 1:27:35.222
No. Not... Not really.
Not... Not on purpose.

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:36.288
How long has this
been going on?

1:27:36.357 --> 1:27:39.092
Minutes! Seconds. Not long.

1:27:39.161 --> 1:27:40.327
What kind of person steals

1:27:40.396 --> 1:27:42.029
someone's boyfriend
on New Year's Eve?

1:27:42.098 --> 1:27:43.592
I didn't mean to. I swear.

1:27:43.661 --> 1:27:45.162
I think this is everything.

1:27:45.231 --> 1:27:46.264
I need a bag!

1:27:46.332 --> 1:27:47.900
Bag, yes. One second.

1:27:48.336 --> 1:27:49.401
Did you know he was supposed

1:27:49.470 --> 1:27:50.868
to ask me
to marry him tonight?

1:27:51.204 --> 1:27:52.933
Um, was he?

1:27:53.002 --> 1:27:54.641
It was so humiliating.

1:27:54.710 --> 1:27:57.411
He basically dumped me
in front of the whole party.

1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.948
Some people even got it
on video.

1:28:01.017 --> 1:28:03.849
I'm sorry. Tissue?

1:28:04.418 --> 1:28:07.686
-Thanks.
-That's... That's awful.

1:28:09.553 --> 1:28:11.688
I've seen your Instagram.

1:28:11.757 --> 1:28:13.420
Your pictures
are really pretty.

1:28:13.489 --> 1:28:14.793
Thanks.

1:28:16.559 --> 1:28:18.031
It's Facetune.

1:28:18.199 --> 1:28:19.593
Oh. That's a good app.

1:28:19.662 --> 1:28:21.633
Okay, I have a bag.

1:28:21.702 --> 1:28:23.937
She doesn't need a bag!
She needs a hug!

1:28:24.006 --> 1:28:25.235
And more tissues!

1:28:25.404 --> 1:28:27.038
Seriously?

1:28:27.340 --> 1:28:28.674
-Griffin!
-Okay.

1:28:30.974 --> 1:28:33.111
You do seem
like a nice person.

1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:34.878
I'm trying to be.

1:28:37.151 --> 1:28:39.388
Oh, no. Okay.

1:28:41.086 --> 1:28:43.923
You know, I really hope you
don't wake up tomorrow

1:28:43.992 --> 1:28:47.555
and realize there was never
anything real between you two.

1:28:47.624 --> 1:28:48.989
And that you just ruined

1:28:49.058 --> 1:28:50.962
the entire course
of all of our lives

1:28:51.031 --> 1:28:56.001
for some meaningless, romantic
New Year's Eve fantasy.

1:28:59.071 --> 1:29:01.008
- Okay, so, it looks
like we're out of Kleenex,

1:29:01.077 --> 1:29:02.477
but I found some TP.

1:29:03.342 --> 1:29:04.710
I have to go.

1:29:05.645 --> 1:29:08.778
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

1:29:08.847 --> 1:29:10.246
Wait, Margot,
where are you going?

1:29:10.315 --> 1:29:11.552
Margot?

1:29:13.418 --> 1:29:14.687
What did you do?

1:29:16.224 --> 1:29:18.086
-Nothing.

1:29:19.889 --> 1:29:21.155
All right, take your stuff.

1:29:28.267 --> 1:29:29.570
Margot?

1:29:30.435 --> 1:29:31.500
Margot, wait.

1:29:31.569 --> 1:29:32.940
What just happened?

1:29:33.009 --> 1:29:34.135
I can't do this.

1:29:34.204 --> 1:29:36.176
I can't be responsible
for ruining your life

1:29:36.245 --> 1:29:37.610
like I do everyone else's.

1:29:37.679 --> 1:29:39.841
Oh, you're not ruining
anything. Okay?

1:29:40.077 --> 1:29:42.443
Listen, Margot,
I'm crazy about you.

1:29:42.812 --> 1:29:44.416
You don't even know me.

1:29:44.485 --> 1:29:45.750
I mean, a couple hours ago,

1:29:45.819 --> 1:29:48.019
you were gonna propose
to somebody else.

1:29:48.088 --> 1:29:50.922
Yeah, and it would've been
the worst mistake of my life.

1:29:51.391 --> 1:29:53.021
Come on, 15 Maple Drive?

1:29:53.090 --> 1:29:55.430
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>
Your tattoo?

1:29:55.499 --> 1:29:57.263
That's got to mean something,
right?

1:29:57.331 --> 1:29:58.663
You know this is fate.

1:29:58.732 --> 1:30:01.200
I am so tired
of everyone saying

1:30:01.269 --> 1:30:02.703
that everything is fate.

1:30:02.771 --> 1:30:05.204
Okay, who doesn't love
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

1:30:05.272 --> 1:30:06.372
15 Maple Drive?

1:30:06.441 --> 1:30:07.573
I'm sure if you googled it,

1:30:07.642 --> 1:30:09.003
there are thousands
of results.

1:30:09.072 --> 1:30:11.072
You could've woken up
in anyone's bed.

1:30:11.141 --> 1:30:13.915
Yeah, but I woke up in yours.
Okay?

1:30:13.984 --> 1:30:15.076
So, call it fate,

1:30:15.145 --> 1:30:17.044
or dumb luck, or chance,
or whatever it is,

1:30:17.113 --> 1:30:19.153
but I still get to choose,
okay?

1:30:19.221 --> 1:30:21.188
And I... I choose you.

1:30:21.256 --> 1:30:23.987
And... And I choose...

1:30:25.054 --> 1:30:27.595
I choose to do
the right thing.

1:30:28.631 --> 1:30:31.463
Maybe fate
is that girl waiting for you

1:30:31.532 --> 1:30:32.529
in your apartment right now.

1:30:32.598 --> 1:30:34.162
You don't believe that.

1:30:34.497 --> 1:30:35.565
Come on.

1:30:35.834 --> 1:30:38.134
Thank you
for helping me tonight.

1:30:38.636 --> 1:30:40.638
I mean, you really are

1:30:40.707 --> 1:30:42.940
the nicest human
I've ever met.

1:30:43.009 --> 1:30:46.279
And before you say it,
"nice" isn't a bad thing.

1:30:46.615 --> 1:30:50.145
It's a great thing.
It's a rare thing.

1:30:51.550 --> 1:30:53.489
So, don't ever stop.

1:30:55.292 --> 1:30:57.152
Wait, Margot, please, just...

1:30:59.597 --> 1:31:01.492
You know, when the universe
gives you a gift,

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:03.059
you don't just say no.

1:31:14.408 --> 1:31:16.072
Happy New Year, Griffin.

1:31:52.015 --> 1:31:53.615
Oh, shit.

1:31:55.116 --> 1:31:57.146
Oh, God.

1:32:23.278 --> 1:32:24.309
Hey!

1:32:24.378 --> 1:32:25.845
Oh, there he is!

1:32:25.913 --> 1:32:28.208
Happy New Year, everybody.
Hello, hello!

1:32:28.277 --> 1:32:30.011
Honey, what happened
to your face?

1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:31.817
Oh, it's fine, it's fine.
I just...

1:32:31.886 --> 1:32:34.848
Yeah, last night,
I ran into a fist.

1:32:34.917 --> 1:32:36.151
-Fist?
-Yeah.

1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:37.490
Well, you should see
the other guy.

1:32:37.559 --> 1:32:38.687
- Yeah, right?

1:32:38.756 --> 1:32:40.222
So, where is Clementine?

1:32:40.291 --> 1:32:41.862
Yeah, yeah,
where's this gorgeous fiancÃ©e

1:32:41.930 --> 1:32:43.427
your mother keeps showing me
on Instacart, huh?

1:32:43.496 --> 1:32:44.765
Instacart! Um...

1:32:44.833 --> 1:32:47.033
She's, uh, actually
not gonna make it today.

1:32:47.102 --> 1:32:49.369
What happened? Oh, she didn't
get your cold, did she?

1:32:49.437 --> 1:32:50.665
No, she's fine, actually.

1:32:50.734 --> 1:32:52.674
Um, yeah...

1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:57.844
It's actually just...
It's not gonna work out.

1:32:57.912 --> 1:32:59.874
Yeah, I'm sorry
to disappoint you guys.

1:32:59.943 --> 1:33:01.243
Oh, disappoint who? Us?

1:33:01.445 --> 1:33:03.982
Yeah, I know, December 30th
is like your special day,

1:33:04.051 --> 1:33:05.550
-and I kind of blew it.
-- Hell, son...

1:33:05.618 --> 1:33:07.181
Son, it's just a day.

1:33:07.249 --> 1:33:09.157
I mean,
you'll find your own day.

1:33:09.226 --> 1:33:10.290
And your own girl.

1:33:10.358 --> 1:33:11.756
Oh. I love you.

1:33:11.825 --> 1:33:13.561
-I love you more.

1:33:13.629 --> 1:33:15.024
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

1:33:15.093 --> 1:33:16.290
-I'll be right back.
-- All right.

1:33:16.359 --> 1:33:17.497
-We'll be right here.
-Okay? All right.

1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:30.910
Okay.

1:33:51.068 --> 1:33:52.165
Dude!

1:33:52.234 --> 1:33:53.261
What?

1:33:53.597 --> 1:33:55.163
- Hey, Kip's here.
- Oh, my God.

1:33:55.232 --> 1:33:56.705
- What are
you doing here?

1:33:58.602 --> 1:33:59.873
Wow.
