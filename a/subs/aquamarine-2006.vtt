01:11.070 --> 01:12.650
Hello.

02:25.850 --> 02:27.310
Look at him, Claire.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.050
I'm looking at him, Hailey.

02:29.310 --> 02:33.140
Sitting there being gorgeous,
looking for someone to rescue.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.570
He should so be rescuing us.
What's wrong with this picture?

02:36.860 --> 02:40.780
Well, all these articles say
we've been way too available.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.480
We need to be more coy.

02:42.780 --> 02:45.240
We're so coy
he barely knows we exist.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.500
Okay. Ray pop quiz.

02:47.790 --> 02:51.290
Favorite song? Favorite food?
Favorite drink? Go, go, go.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.700
Weezer's "Island in the Sun."

02:54.000 --> 02:56.160
- Dr Pepper. Oranges?
- Very nice.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.890
- I'm trying to read.
- Fine.

02:59.170 --> 03:02.000
Then read me
the latest on boy-bagging technology.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.260
Oh, okay. This one's called
"Fluff and Retreat."

03:05.550 --> 03:09.470
"Fluff his ego, then walk away.
Not only is he left wanting more...

03:09.770 --> 03:12.400
but he's under the impression
that it's his idea."

03:12.690 --> 03:15.530
- Nice.
- That's really cool.

03:18.820 --> 03:21.780
Summer's almost over
and you haven't gone in the water once.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.940
Once would be way too many times.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.750
Excuse me.

03:27.030 --> 03:30.570
Do you realize we've got less than
five days until you have to move?

03:30.870 --> 03:33.120
I don't want you moving
halfway around the world.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.670
Claire, you're such a ruiner.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.580
I'd gone, like, a half-hour
without thinking about it.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.970
- Hailey, I'm sorry but...
- Besides, I haven't kissed Raymond yet.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.960
So I'm not going anywhere.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.230
Incoming.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.320
- Hello, hottie.
- It's Raymond.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.070
Hail, did you order a sand-witch?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.700
Cecilia's back from camp.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.450
Don't worry. He won't fall for yuck.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.490
He's way too smart for that.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.120
- Hey, Cecilia.
- Hey.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.160
Whoa.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.420
Did they get...

04:20.709 --> 04:21.959
bigger?

04:22.260 --> 04:23.580
She could poke an eye out.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.210
We just...
We have to decode his body language.

04:26.890 --> 04:29.560
Look, it's fine.
I mean, if he's into her...

04:29.850 --> 04:33.690
he'll shake his hair, stretch his arms,
and flex those muscles.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.270
Yeah?

04:36.520 --> 04:39.270
- What was that?
- Fingers. Fingers through the hair.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.150
I mean, technically,
that wasn't shaking.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.900
Right?

04:47.740 --> 04:49.280
Please, gods of love, no shake.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.030
No stretch. No flex. No...

04:51.330 --> 04:53.210
- No...
- No, no...

04:54.580 --> 04:56.870
No.

04:57.420 --> 05:00.050
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

05:00.340 --> 05:02.680
- Thanks. We're good.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.720
Babysit much?

05:08.640 --> 05:09.890
I can't take it anymore.

05:10.180 --> 05:12.600
As long as he doesn't flip
his sunglasses we're fine.

05:12.890 --> 05:14.760
Hey, Ray, think fast.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.030
- I can't look anymore. You.
- Sorry.

05:18.270 --> 05:21.270
- I figured you could catch.
- You're right.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.560
What? Did he flip them?

05:24.860 --> 05:26.690
It's really sunny out.
It doesn't count.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.200
Yeah.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.870
- Say something.
- You'll never tan in those clothes.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.660
- Or skin cancer.
- Please. We don't even smoke.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.460
Such losers.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.590
The perfect end to a perfect day.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.100
Claire. Hailey. We need your help.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.600
Hey.

05:53.890 --> 05:58.610
- What?
- Oh, we've decided to fire Raymond.

05:58.890 --> 06:00.470
- What?
- What?

06:01.020 --> 06:03.600
- No. No, you can't.
- No. No.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.680
- You should've seen your faces.
- That is so not funny.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.330
Oh, you girls, you're too wound up.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.410
Now, help bring in the Last Splash
decorations, please.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.530
Weatherman says
a big storm's coming.

06:17.830 --> 06:21.790
- We'll put them up again after it clears.
- Ray will still be there when you're done.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.330
Grandpa.

06:23.590 --> 06:26.180
Oh, supper's at 6, Claire.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.080
You'll come back
after dinner, right?

06:28.380 --> 06:31.210
- We can hang out in the rec room...
- No. I have other plans.

06:31.510 --> 06:33.510
What?
But you promised...

06:33.800 --> 06:36.840
- God, chill out. Your grandma's right.
- Hailey, I'm so...

06:37.140 --> 06:39.760
- Sorry.
- Jeez, Leonard.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.820
M or W?

06:48.740 --> 06:50.620
Right. Nice to see you too.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.280
W.

06:59.410 --> 07:01.450
He knows what you did last summer.

07:15.050 --> 07:16.590
Get...

07:21.640 --> 07:24.600
- Mom, I'm home.
- Hey, kiddo.

07:25.610 --> 07:28.450
Hailey, your boxes
won't pack themselves.

07:28.730 --> 07:32.070
Don't put this off
unity the movers come.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.200
Come on, Moby. Don't play me like that.
I haven't seen you in days.

07:43.710 --> 07:47.550
Hailey, you can unpack as much
as you want. We're still moving.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.720
Yeah.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.970
How was the club?

07:54.260 --> 07:56.710
Maybe I could get more
than one syllable this time.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.220
It was fine.

07:58.510 --> 08:00.300
That was three.

08:05.190 --> 08:06.440
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

08:07.360 --> 08:11.700
But you didn't want to leave Boston
either, remember?

08:12.490 --> 08:15.740
And look what happened.
You met Claire.

08:16.030 --> 08:20.110
You know, Australia could be
another amazing adventure for us, Hails.

08:22.710 --> 08:27.880
- How about we start packing your room?
- How about I live here until I'm 18?

08:28.170 --> 08:31.180
How about we go back
to fewer syllables?

08:32.419 --> 08:33.789
Cool.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.130
That was one.

08:42.850 --> 08:45.100
A storm warning is in...

08:45.390 --> 08:48.680
That's where Cecilia Banks gets
all the drama. Just look at her dad.

08:48.980 --> 08:51.100
Well, as you can see... Huh.

08:51.650 --> 08:55.150
Hailey, how am I supposed to face
eighth grade without you?

08:55.450 --> 08:57.620
My locker is right next
to the boys' bathroom.

08:57.910 --> 09:00.040
And I have co-ed PE class by myself.

09:00.330 --> 09:02.370
We have to dance
with Raymond at Last Splash.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.710
We'll be such great dancers that he'll
realize that he has to marry one of us.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.210
And we'll be so happy
that one of us got him...

09:09.500 --> 09:11.830
that we won't even be jealous.
You know?

09:12.130 --> 09:15.260
Unless he picks you.
That wouldn't be okay.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.720
- Joke.
- What if this is our last camp-out?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.550
What if this is it?

09:23.890 --> 09:25.140
Oh, gods of hurricanes...

09:25.430 --> 09:28.720
makers of thunder and lightning
and majestical waves...

09:29.020 --> 09:32.140
useth your power to keep my mom
from moving to Australia.

09:32.650 --> 09:35.110
Maketh her to see
the error of her ways...

09:35.400 --> 09:38.820
and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.450
Ameneth.

09:43.740 --> 09:47.070
- You're insane.
- That's what they tell me.

09:47.370 --> 09:48.910
Yeah.

09:52.340 --> 09:53.590
Ameneth.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.920
Oh, my God.
The vending machine's possessed.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.760
- Looks like we got free...
- Hailey!

10:06.060 --> 10:08.440
Soda?
Where are you? You dead? Don't die.

10:08.730 --> 10:11.400
I'm not dead. I'm right here.
Follow my voice.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.650
Oh, God. Something's out there.

10:16.820 --> 10:19.160
Claire, I want you to know
that if Leonard comes...

10:19.450 --> 10:21.240
and chops us
into a million pieces...

10:21.530 --> 10:25.660
then you are totally, completely
and eternally my best friend.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.630
You're my best friend too.

10:28.910 --> 10:31.450
And I broke your iPod.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.220
What are you girls doing out here
in this weather? Come on.

10:42.510 --> 10:43.760
Grandma, you scared me.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.050
Let's get the two of you
tucked up in bed.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.100
Mrs. B., if I have nightmares
tonight, I'm blaming you.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.610
Oh, gods of hurricanes...

11:00.860 --> 11:03.070
makers of thunder and lightning...

11:03.820 --> 11:06.650
- Gods of hurricanes...
- Just take me now.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.830
Oh, gods of hurricanes, makers of
thunder and lightning...

11:10.120 --> 11:11.620
and majestical waves.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.720
Please useth your powers
to keep my mom...

11:16.210 --> 11:21.840
Maketh her to see the error of her ways
and keepeth us in Bay Bridge.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.290
Oh, my God.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.580
- Come on, men.
- On three. Ready? One...

11:55.500 --> 11:57.000
Raymond's out. Come on.

11:57.290 --> 11:58.830
Yeah, bring it up.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.760
- He's beautiful. Stay calm.
- Come on.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.020
- Catch you later, man.
- Yeah, catch you Later.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.650
Look at this.

12:21.030 --> 12:24.700
- What a wreck.
- It's Ray. Don't look.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.220
Hello, little freaky blue crab.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.820
Claire, look.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.830
- Ray. Hope you're ready to clean.
- Wow.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.760
Think you'll call off Last Splash?

12:40.250 --> 12:43.170
- No. No, Mr. B.
- No. Grandpa, no...

12:43.470 --> 12:45.230
Mr. B., I'm sorry,
you can't do that.

12:45.470 --> 12:48.270
Mr. B., we have been
planning for this for, like, ever.

12:48.550 --> 12:52.090
- It'll be all right.
- Grandpa? Are the pool lights still on?

13:00.610 --> 13:01.820
Claire.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.470
- Hold on.
- There's a shark in the pool.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.110
I got you. You're okay.

13:37.390 --> 13:38.810
Here, somebody get a chair.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.320
Calm down. There you go.
She may be in shock.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.350
- Take deep breaths.
- You all right?

13:44.740 --> 13:47.870
She gets scared in the water.
Her parents drowned.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.870
- You all right, honey?
- I saw something.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.080
It's in there, and...
I don't know what it was.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.540
Half the ocean washed up
in there last night.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.700
Hailey, take Claire inside.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.160
Leonard? Lock up the patio.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.500
- I don't want anyone else falling in.
- Clean it, lock it, got it.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.640
That was tight, Ray.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.800
Thanks, Ray.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.310
Well, come on.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.180
My God. Raymond totally
jumped in there to save you...

14:20.480 --> 14:22.400
with his actual biceps.

14:22.690 --> 14:25.200
Did you feel them around you?
Were they flexed?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.650
Oh, God, they must have been flexed.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.160
If you had stopped breathing,
you were this close to mouth-to-mouth.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.540
There's something in there.
I'm serious.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.920
It looked like...
I can't even say it. But...

14:36.910 --> 14:39.700
I swear, it just stared at me
with its eyes.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.250
You're in shock...

14:41.500 --> 14:42.910
from touching Raymond.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.510
Hailey, I know what I saw.

14:48.170 --> 14:52.380
Fine. Then we'll just go back
when no one's looking and check it out.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.640
No way. I didn't mean
to get in the water in the first place...

14:55.930 --> 14:59.550
and I'm not going back there again.
Something bad could've happened.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.100
Come on, Clairedy Cat.

15:01.850 --> 15:05.100
Put on your big-girl pants
and meet me at 9:00.

15:10.650 --> 15:13.860
Be careful.
Gram will be super mad at us.

15:18.620 --> 15:19.950
It's Leonard.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.250
Come on.

15:51.530 --> 15:54.530
Hey, maybe we should
get fishing poles or something.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.150
No. I don't want to catch it.
I want to feed it.

16:07.130 --> 16:10.800
- Fish sticks?
- Maybe it was an octopus.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.920
With blue hair and a tail?

16:14.220 --> 16:17.810
It could've been blue
seaweed, or kelp.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.440
It was not an octopus
and it wasn't kelp.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.340
- You want one?
- I saw hair.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.930
God.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.680
If you're gonna ignore every word I say
I can hang out alone.

16:27.940 --> 16:28.940
I'm not ignoring you.

16:29.190 --> 16:32.980
- I doubt myself. Don't doubt me too.
- You're getting hysterical over nothing.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.780
I bet I know what it was.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.290
I'm guessing...

16:40.580 --> 16:42.500
it was a mermaid.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.359
- Boo.
- Aaaah!

17:12.900 --> 17:14.190
It's a...

17:15.900 --> 17:17.230
You're a...

17:17.530 --> 17:18.990
A... a mer...

17:19.450 --> 17:22.579
I can see we have to take this slowly.

17:22.869 --> 17:25.250
Mer-maid.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.740
Mermaid.

17:28.670 --> 17:31.880
Fabled marine creature,
half woman, half fish...

17:32.250 --> 17:34.790
known for sitting on rocks,
staring into mirrors...

17:35.090 --> 17:37.840
and obsessively combing
our long, beautiful hair.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.140
Blah, blah, blah.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.840
Wha...? What is going on?

17:45.140 --> 17:48.720
Stop shrieking like a couple of gulls.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.820
For shrimps, you're awfully Loud.

17:53.820 --> 17:55.450
- You speak English?
- Yeah.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.580
Mermaids speak every language
known to man, fish, crustacean...

17:59.870 --> 18:01.830
and several varieties of seafowl.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.870
What can you speak?

18:04.160 --> 18:06.490
I got a C in Spanish.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.790
Wait. What if she's, like...

18:11.080 --> 18:13.330
- bad or something?
- Why would she be bad?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.960
She's a fictional sea creature.

18:16.210 --> 18:18.880
- They could be bad.
- We are not fictional.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.470
We're discrete.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.190
I've never been this close
to a human before.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.180
Yeah. Must be weird for you.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.450
What?

18:40.360 --> 18:41.900
Nothing.

18:42.490 --> 18:43.900
You're staring at my tail.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.120
- Well, yeah, I was.
- Do you...

18:47.410 --> 18:49.120
want to touch it?

18:50.620 --> 18:52.250
Okay.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.050
It's slimy.

18:58.340 --> 19:02.460
Thank you. I rub it with kelp
and jellyfish twice a day.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.770
Wow.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.350
Please don't eat us.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.190
The thought.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.280
- It's okay.
- I want to see what feet feel like.

19:21.570 --> 19:22.820
Give it.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.450
Can you pick things up with them?

19:27.450 --> 19:29.950
No, but, I can kick with them
if you don't let go.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.000
Hey, get back here.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.100
How did you do that?

19:45.930 --> 19:48.390
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see my father.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.590
He can make some serious waves.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.180
- Like last night, for example.
- Your dad made those waves?

19:54.730 --> 19:56.240
Yeah.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.890
He's mad at me because
I swam away from home...

19:59.190 --> 20:02.480
three days before I'm supposed
to get married off to this merman...

20:02.780 --> 20:04.910
who's about as deep as a tidal pool.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.720
- Hey.
- Leonard. We have to go.

20:06.910 --> 20:08.410
He's a psycho. You have to hide.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.780
- Where are you going?
- We'll be back tomorrow.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.500
- Promise?
- Promise.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.420
- Someone over there?
- Come on.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.090
Don't get seen.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.880
Hailey. Hailey, wake up.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.480
What in the world?

21:14.770 --> 21:16.400
Oh, no.

21:18.940 --> 21:22.490
- This is bad. This is so bad.
- Come on.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.030
What have you done?

21:29.950 --> 21:33.170
- I drained the pool.
- She's not in there.

21:33.450 --> 21:35.740
- But how could she get out?
- I don't know.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.200
Come on.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.230
Oh, it's you.
You scared the salt out of me.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.940
I thought you were that man
with that awful sucking machine.

21:58.310 --> 22:02.060
- I just about got turned inside out.
- How did you get in here?

22:02.360 --> 22:03.900
I used these.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.440
Whoa.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.940
My very own pair.

22:12.490 --> 22:15.360
Oh, and check this out.

22:16.250 --> 22:17.710
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

22:20.460 --> 22:22.630
Wow. Isn't it cute?

22:23.550 --> 22:26.470
- Very cute.
- And I can sit on it.

22:27.340 --> 22:29.840
Hey, we gotta get you out.
Come on. You'll be seen.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.760
- Give her your t-shirt.
- No. My bathing suit's like boy-repellent.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.400
- What if we see Raymond?
- It's your bathing suit...

22:36.680 --> 22:38.510
or her birthday suit.
Come on.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.190
Stop.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.040
Oh, no. That's not what you do.
You have to...

23:00.330 --> 23:02.660
- Put your arms there.
- Put your arms through them.

23:06.590 --> 23:07.800
Wow.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.470
- That looks amazing.
- I know.

23:20.940 --> 23:25.030
I don't understand how you can sleep
on these when they're so jumpy.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.030
I could just do this all day.

23:27.320 --> 23:29.110
Claire, what on earth
are you doing?

23:32.610 --> 23:36.360
You really need to stop.
Gram is gonna be really mad at us.

23:36.870 --> 23:38.420
We're gonna get in huge trouble.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.120
- You worry too much.
- I rest my case.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.170
This is so much fun.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.470
I love Legs.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.500
So, do you get to keep them?

23:51.090 --> 23:53.000
We can only have legs
when the sun's out.

23:53.300 --> 23:56.170
We have to keep them dry.
Or at least that's what I've heard.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.230
I've never had the guts
to try them.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.440
So this is your first time ashore?

24:00.730 --> 24:03.230
First time on land.
First time with legs.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.980
- Can you believe it?
- You'd never know.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.690
But I got to be careful.
Add moonlight or water, instant tail.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.780
Look what I can do.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.770
Stop that.

24:22.710 --> 24:24.800
Crabs. They found me.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.540
With a shell?

24:27.750 --> 24:29.410
You can hear
the ocean through these.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.170
Yeah, but...

24:31.460 --> 24:33.590
Well, it works both ways.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.550
The ocean can hear you too.

24:37.930 --> 24:39.190
Hello? Dad?

24:39.470 --> 24:41.590
Aquamarine,
what do you think you're doing?

24:41.890 --> 24:44.260
- Daddy...
- Shell phone.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.020
Could you give me a minute?

24:47.650 --> 24:48.990
Sure. Sorry.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.230
Well, that's your plan, not mine.

24:51.530 --> 24:56.120
I don't want to marry
some spoiled, rich squid.

24:56.410 --> 25:00.000
Well, you can make all the storms
you want, but I'm not coming back.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.410
No, love is not a myth, Daddy.
It's real.

25:05.870 --> 25:08.910
- You think her dad is doing this?
- I'll prove it.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.830
If I'm wrong,
then I will honor your plans.

25:12.130 --> 25:16.050
And I'll call you every night, okay,
so calm down.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.430
I have to find love.

25:25.730 --> 25:30.400
We don't have it where I'm from.
If I can't find it in three days, I'm sunk.

25:30.690 --> 25:34.310
- You don't have love?
- No. My dad says it's just a myth.

25:34.610 --> 25:36.070
We marry who our parents pick...

25:36.320 --> 25:39.780
and my dad thinks I have bubbles
in my brain because I believe in love.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.500
The only way
I can get out of my wedding...

25:42.740 --> 25:45.160
is if I can prove to him
that love exists.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.340
But that means
I only get three days.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.160
Or else I'll be swimming
down the aisle with...

25:51.250 --> 25:52.500
that blowfish.

25:52.750 --> 25:55.250
But if you don't have love,
how do you know it exists?

25:55.550 --> 25:58.560
I saw it once. And I want it.

26:03.350 --> 26:05.020
With him.

26:14.650 --> 26:16.690
- Raymond?
- Check it out.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.400
Raymond?

26:19.950 --> 26:21.370
Raymond.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.540
Raymond is the one I love.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.760
No!

26:36.420 --> 26:38.670
No!

26:42.470 --> 26:45.630
Raymond. Raymond.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.430
- Raymond.
- Yeah.

26:47.730 --> 26:50.440
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.690
Do you love me?

26:57.070 --> 27:01.240
No, but, I think you're hot.
Really hot.

27:01.530 --> 27:04.030
Come on, we gotta go.
The Beach House is going off.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.570
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

27:05.830 --> 27:08.250
Well, I'll see you later.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.630
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

27:10.920 --> 27:15.050
- Come on.
- Hey, drop me off at home, can you?

27:20.010 --> 27:21.720
He doesn't love me?

27:22.010 --> 27:25.730
How can he not love me?
I need some salt.

27:26.010 --> 27:28.340
- What did you say?
- He said I was hot.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.720
But, how would he know?

27:31.020 --> 27:32.610
Do I feel hot to you?

27:33.940 --> 27:35.900
What he meant
is not how you took it.

27:36.190 --> 27:38.190
Help me get him
to fall in love with me.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.230
- Yeah, right.
- No, no, no. Raymond's way too popular.

27:41.490 --> 27:44.370
- You should pick someone else.
- All the girls are after him.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.080
- Even a few boys.
- Right.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.000
Fine.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.070
Then you don't get your wish.

27:50.370 --> 27:51.740
- What?
- Wish? Wait, wait.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.340
- What?
- What wish?

27:54.630 --> 27:57.630
Oh, you know.
If you help a mermaid, you get a wish.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.710
Any wish you could wish for.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.430
I thought that was genies.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.010
You believe in genies?

28:07.760 --> 28:11.720
What if our wish
involves other people?

28:12.020 --> 28:13.610
Like my mom.

28:14.190 --> 28:16.030
It's a wish. Any wish.

28:16.310 --> 28:19.350
As long as it doesn't violate
the laws of nature.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.900
We'll help you.
We'll help you.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.160
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. Yes.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.570
Just to let you know...

28:28.870 --> 28:31.170
- this is a humongous sacrifice for us.
- Yeah.

28:31.450 --> 28:32.820
Giving up Raymond?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.660
So you know him pretty well?

28:34.960 --> 28:37.420
Oh, yeah. We're experts on Raymond.

28:37.670 --> 28:41.010
- Yeah, we know him really well.
- We're like Rayologists.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.930
Good. But he has to say he loves me.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.930
Because I need proof for my dad.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.350
Otherwise you don't get your wish.
Deal?

28:50.060 --> 28:51.560
Deal.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.060
Deal.

28:54.890 --> 28:56.930
My name's Aquamarine.

28:57.230 --> 29:00.730
Now, let's go find Raymond.

29:02.150 --> 29:03.190
Whoo!

29:05.740 --> 29:09.410
- You need shoes.
- Yeah, and undies.

29:36.770 --> 29:40.900
Just stick with the pros.
Boys are what we live for.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.270
Creepy, right?
My mom collects this stuff.

29:43.570 --> 29:44.890
What does your mom do?

29:45.150 --> 29:47.360
Besides ruin my life?
She's a marine biologist.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.950
- She's scientific.
- More like horrific.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.660
She's dragged me
over the country for her job.

29:52.950 --> 29:54.700
She's been working
to clean up the bay.

29:54.950 --> 29:56.370
Well, tell her thanks for me...

29:56.660 --> 29:59.410
because it tastes 10 times
better than it did years ago.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.210
Really? Huh.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.510
Okay, first things first.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.550
Aqua, what are you doing?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.600
He doesn't like this harsh light.

30:13.930 --> 30:17.300
- Moby. He came out of hiding.
- Wow.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.940
Can you make boobs
come out of hiding?

30:20.270 --> 30:21.560
What?

30:23.320 --> 30:25.280
We begin where a girl starts a first crush.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.520
We call him.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.530
Call him? What?

30:29.820 --> 30:32.070
No, I can't.
What am I supposed to say to him?

30:32.370 --> 30:35.540
Nothing. We just call and hang up.
We do it all the time.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.040
- Why?
- I don't know. It's just what you do.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.500
Okay.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.330
Wait a minute.

30:47.380 --> 30:49.040
It's ringing.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.710
Hello?

30:58.180 --> 31:00.180
That was fantastic.
Let's do it again.

31:03.810 --> 31:06.100
Okay.
The next step here is the ride-by.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.190
- Very important in any crush.
- Now remember, you have to act casual.

31:10.450 --> 31:13.330
Yes, like you didn't even remember
this was his street.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.960
That's it. That's Raymond's house.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.540
Oh, that hurts.
But this will be worth it.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.350
There he is.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.640
What the...?

31:54.320 --> 31:56.280
Aqua, no, that's the brake.

32:15.140 --> 32:18.310
- Aqua, are you okay?
- I saw him. Did you see him?

32:18.600 --> 32:21.100
- He waved at me.
- Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?

32:21.390 --> 32:24.510
- Hi, Raymond.
- Oh, my God.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.100
We didn't even remember
this was your street.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.450
All right,
let's see what you've got here.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.570
Nothing too serious.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.750
- We'll run it under some cold water...
- No. No.

32:39.990 --> 32:42.280
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I wouldn't hurt you.

32:43.790 --> 32:46.340
All right, let me at least
put a Band-Aid on it.

32:47.710 --> 32:49.290
Lifeguard's always prepared, right?

32:51.380 --> 32:53.210
Here we go.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.260
This won't hurt a bit.

32:57.930 --> 33:00.140
There you go. Voila!

33:01.640 --> 33:02.930
Thank you.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.650
It's beautiful.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.110
So, what was your name?

33:14.070 --> 33:15.310
Aquamarine.

33:15.570 --> 33:18.110
Cool name. Will I see you
at the Street Fair today?

33:20.030 --> 33:23.240
- I love this song.
- Oh, no.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.500
- Who ordered broom service?
- Hi, Raymond.

33:28.710 --> 33:30.880
I'm here for my driving lesson.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.390
Let's get you up.

33:35.130 --> 33:36.750
You going to be all right?

33:37.050 --> 33:41.010
Okay, cool. Hang on one sec.
I got to grab my keys.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.730
So, I'll see you later?

33:45.850 --> 33:48.180
Rock. Check it. Watch out.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.390
- Who is she?
- Cecilia.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.700
Thinks she's the shiz,
because her dad does weather.

33:53.940 --> 33:57.690
- Her dad can make weather?
- No. He just reports it.

33:57.990 --> 34:00.330
Shut up. I know how to drive.

34:00.570 --> 34:04.570
- And she's a princess?
- No, no, no, just a royal bitch.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.500
Then why are you so intimidated?

34:07.250 --> 34:08.800
Got it. Sorry.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.340
Whoa.

34:15.170 --> 34:18.090
Hey, guys, does she have something
against girls' clothes?

34:22.889 --> 34:24.480
Nice hair.

34:24.850 --> 34:26.650
- Who are you?
- Aquamarine.

34:26.929 --> 34:30.100
- She's my cousin.
- Well, that's kind of pretty.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.360
For a crayon.

34:32.900 --> 34:36.159
I was named Aquamarine
after a rare and precious gemstone.

34:36.440 --> 34:41.730
Whereas Cecilia translated means
dim-sighted.

34:42.070 --> 34:44.400
But your parents know you
better than I do.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.780
- Wow.
- What did you just say to me?

34:47.710 --> 34:50.590
Yep, definitely dim-sighted.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.470
There's something very fishy
about that girl.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.470
Cecilia Banks blew a gasket.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.610
Who cares about her.
What about Ray? I mean...

35:10.690 --> 35:12.570
what happened to me back there?

35:12.860 --> 35:16.490
- I was such a clam. I couldn't think.
- Don't worry.

35:16.780 --> 35:19.660
Everything we've learned about boys
has come from the pages...

35:20.030 --> 35:22.660
of these magazines. Come on.

35:23.070 --> 35:28.110
I can't stop thinking
about him. I feel so weird and tingly.

35:30.370 --> 35:32.200
- What?
- Look at my finger scales.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.170
Oh, wow.

35:34.540 --> 35:37.830
They've never been this color before.
They change color with my mood.

35:38.130 --> 35:40.750
- Whoa, weird.
- But I don't know what mood this is.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.840
- Love.
- Love.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.930
Okay. Start reading. We have a lot
to cover before we go to the Street Fair.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.190
Oh, I don't like this.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.370
Come on.

36:09.870 --> 36:11.870
- I need some salt.
- More like this.

36:14.460 --> 36:16.340
Number 28.
Come on.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.000
Come on, focus. Focus.

36:31.430 --> 36:33.970
How do you remember all this?

36:34.270 --> 36:37.520
- You have to be flirty but demure.
- Yeah.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.950
Devoted, but not desperate.
Available but elusive.

36:41.490 --> 36:44.240
And if he calls Wednesday
for Saturday, you have to be busy.

36:44.530 --> 36:46.320
Even though you're free.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.250
It's so annoying.

36:49.330 --> 36:51.460
Yet strangely addictive.

36:51.750 --> 36:54.750
- No. No.
- I think she's on a boy-data overload.

36:55.210 --> 36:56.460
Let's take her out.

36:57.420 --> 36:59.130
Roll up. Roll up.

37:02.630 --> 37:04.510
- Ain't got a chance.
- It's right here.

37:04.630 --> 37:06.340
There he is.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.480
- Ray. Ray, hi.
- Calm down.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.260
Haven't you learned anything?
Let him see you first.

37:12.560 --> 37:15.190
- Sorry. I just got so excited, I forgot.
- It's okay.

37:15.480 --> 37:20.400
Hey, how about if we do what...?
What "Liz D. From Skokie" suggests?

37:20.690 --> 37:25.440
"The laugh and pass."
Casually walk past him laughing.

37:25.740 --> 37:27.280
Good idea.

37:29.910 --> 37:31.960
You're so funny.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.880
Okay, look at him.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.670
Look away.

37:42.340 --> 37:45.010
Look at him, play with your hair.
Just kind of twirl it.

37:45.260 --> 37:47.060
Yeah, I saw that.

37:47.340 --> 37:50.460
- Arch your back. Arch your back.
- Pucker your lips, flip your hair.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.010
- Flip it. Yeah, flip it.
- Put your back out.

37:53.310 --> 37:55.940
Don't look at him.
No, no. He's looking at you.

37:56.310 --> 37:58.930
- Okay. "Fluff and Retreat."
- What?

37:59.230 --> 38:00.940
Come on, you can do it.
Come on, Ray.

38:01.230 --> 38:03.310
Fluff his ego, and retreat. Go.

38:04.690 --> 38:06.560
Yeah!

38:07.490 --> 38:09.200
Wow, Raymond, you're good.

38:09.490 --> 38:12.110
- Bye.
- Wha...? Wha...?

38:12.410 --> 38:14.750
- You didn't fluff enough.
- Here you go, man.

38:15.790 --> 38:17.710
- Hey, where are you going?
- Guess she did.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.670
- Come on.
- Guys, I'll catch up.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.050
- I'll hang out with Aqua.
- He gave a nickname.

38:22.540 --> 38:24.670
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:25.050 --> 38:26.720
Ar, ar, ar!

38:27.010 --> 38:29.510
Are you having a good time?

38:30.930 --> 38:33.310
Yes, following you around is fun.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.600
Okay.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.770
- This guy's for you.
- Thanks.

38:44.070 --> 38:46.530
- Get your cotton candy.
- You're welcome.

38:47.530 --> 38:51.540
Hurry, hurry. On the
fairground you and the family...

38:51.870 --> 38:53.910
- and the weird Tattoo Lady.
- You want one?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.110
Yeah.

38:58.410 --> 39:00.330
Just one, please. Thanks.

39:11.220 --> 39:13.680
I just love eating cotton candy.
I mean...

39:13.970 --> 39:16.090
I love eating it. Right, Hail?

39:16.390 --> 39:18.470
It's great.
It is so much fun to eat it.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.410
- It just vanished.
- Mm-hm.

39:37.410 --> 39:39.200
Shake...

39:41.000 --> 39:42.840
stretch...

39:46.550 --> 39:49.220
flex.
He likes her!

39:51.630 --> 39:54.460
- Roll up, roll up.
- Hey, what are those, water bikes?

39:56.100 --> 39:58.310
What? You've never been
on a paddleboat before?

39:58.600 --> 40:00.150
- Oh, he's so cute.
- Come on...

40:00.430 --> 40:02.760
- I'll give you your first ride.
- Sure.

40:03.060 --> 40:06.850
- Do you think she'll be okay out there?
- She's with Ray, isn't she?

40:07.150 --> 40:09.990
- Popcorn. Get your popcorn.
- I guess. Come on.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.370
So, how long are you in town?

40:21.660 --> 40:24.790
Two more days.
Then my dad's making me come home.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.580
If he doesn't get his way,
it's always a huge disaster.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.220
Pretty controlling, huh?

40:31.170 --> 40:33.840
- You have no idea.
- Yeah, I do.

40:34.130 --> 40:37.340
My dad, he's all dead set
on me starting college next week...

40:37.640 --> 40:40.690
but, I don't know, I wanna
take a year off and travel.

40:40.970 --> 40:44.560
I've never been out of Florida, so
we've been arguing about it all summer.

40:45.150 --> 40:48.900
And, he'll probably win the argument.
He always does.

40:49.190 --> 40:51.940
They just don't get it.
Sometimes, you have to leave home...

40:52.240 --> 40:54.700
- to figure out what you want.
- Exactly.

40:57.910 --> 41:01.620
You know, you're not like
most girls around here.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.620
They're so cute together.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.300
Claire, how romantic is that?

41:10.210 --> 41:11.830
This is nice.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.890
- The sun is setting.
- Yeah, I know.

41:16.180 --> 41:18.480
- We timed it well, didn't we?
- I have to get back.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.510
What? Okay.

41:23.930 --> 41:25.600
- All right. Okay. All right.
- Oh, no.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.480
We're going the wrong way.
We're heading back out to sea.

41:28.730 --> 41:31.600
Here we go, we're turning
around. Everything's okay.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.520
- Hailey.
- Claire.

41:33.820 --> 41:35.120
- Sunset.
- Oh, no.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.360
- She's gonna pop a tail.
- Hailey. Claire.

41:37.660 --> 41:40.040
Just add moonlight or water.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.670
- I have to get back.
- Hey. Hey.

41:42.950 --> 41:45.820
Here, let's talk about something
to distract you, okay?

41:46.120 --> 41:49.120
Like, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

41:49.420 --> 41:52.340
- Probably heard about the Last Splash?
- We're coming Aqua.

41:52.630 --> 41:56.260
- It's a party. You're really in a hurry.
- Come on. Hurry up. Pedal.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.170
It's not your fault.
I have to be somewhere.

42:01.510 --> 42:03.800
You gotta help our friend.
She's sick. She's got...

42:04.060 --> 42:05.310
- Hydrophobia.
- Hypertension.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.810
Yeah.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.640
- Yeah.
- Come on. Hurry, please.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.280
This is serious.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.030
Go faster.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.740
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.730
- Okay.
- You're almost there.

42:17.990 --> 42:20.830
- Come on. You're almost there.
- Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.

42:21.070 --> 42:22.400
- Careful.
- Hey.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.490
Let's go. Keep going.
Don't stop.

42:24.790 --> 42:26.190
Bikes are around the corner.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.670
- Run.
- Sorry.

42:29.370 --> 42:30.620
- Go.
- I had so much fun.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.420
Go. Aqua, go, go.
We gotta get you back.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.170
I'll be right back.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.600
Hey, Ray.

42:43.430 --> 42:46.430
That was too close.
I need some water to spend the night in.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.020
- The ocean?
- No ocean.

42:48.270 --> 42:51.440
My father would just manipulate
the currents and pull me back home.

42:51.690 --> 42:53.190
I know a place.

42:56.900 --> 42:59.230
Holy mackerel.

42:59.610 --> 43:01.440
Hey, come on.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.340
Come on let's go.
Claire, you doing this?

43:10.210 --> 43:12.960
- Aren't you coming?
- I don't do water...

43:13.250 --> 43:14.790
on the ground or in the air.

43:15.630 --> 43:19.010
Raymond was about to kiss you
with his actual lips.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.310
- Stupid sun.
- Did Ray say anything?

43:22.760 --> 43:25.420
- He asked if I heard of Last Splash.
- What?

43:25.720 --> 43:27.640
- Really?
- Exactly what did he say?

43:30.440 --> 43:32.070
- I can't remember.
- So was it:

43:32.310 --> 43:34.640
"Are you going?"
or "Will you go with me?"

43:34.940 --> 43:36.560
- Is there a difference?
- Huge.

43:36.860 --> 43:38.660
- Major.
- Okay. Well...

43:38.940 --> 43:42.190
it started with,
"What are you doing tomorrow night?"

43:42.490 --> 43:43.740
My God, that's all you need.

43:43.990 --> 43:45.240
He was gonna ask for a date.

43:45.530 --> 43:47.110
- He was?
- Absolutely.

43:47.410 --> 43:51.070
- Yes.
- Be careful, guys.

43:57.300 --> 44:00.050
- Thanks.
- Sure.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.230
- Why won't Claire come with us?
- She's not good around water.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.100
It's kind of a long story.

44:17.690 --> 44:20.480
I wish I could hide out here with you.

44:31.960 --> 44:35.380
- Is this gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

45:02.570 --> 45:04.370
I almost forgot.

45:04.950 --> 45:06.540
Me too.

45:07.240 --> 45:10.070
- This is nice.
- Good.

45:10.410 --> 45:12.530
Are you gonna be okay in here?

45:12.830 --> 45:14.920
You gonna be okay out there?

45:19.380 --> 45:20.720
I'll see you tomorrow...

45:21.050 --> 45:23.800
fish-butt.
I heard that.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.920
I never realized
how big this room was.

45:28.220 --> 45:32.470
Without all my stuff in it.
I want this wish so bad, Claire.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.190
Claire?

45:37.480 --> 45:38.610
Hm?

45:39.020 --> 45:43.190
Do you think he'll fall in actual love
with her in two days?

45:43.490 --> 45:47.120
He has to. It's our last hope.

45:52.490 --> 45:54.110
- Hailey.
- What?

45:54.410 --> 45:57.830
We completely forgot something.
What's she gonna wear to Last Splash?

45:58.120 --> 46:01.290
I mean, she can't keep wearing
your t-shirts. No offense.

46:01.590 --> 46:05.390
Okay, think. We'll take the first bus into
Tampa tomorrow and we'll go shopping.

46:05.670 --> 46:08.000
- Wha...? No. We can't.
- We have to.

46:08.430 --> 46:12.350
Besides, I have $400 saved up
from working at the aquarium.

46:12.680 --> 46:16.140
- Do you know what trouble we'll be in?
- Come on, Clairedy Cat.

46:19.520 --> 46:23.480
- Sorry about that.
- I don't know, Hailey.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.580
Smile.

46:38.290 --> 46:40.500
Hello.

46:42.790 --> 46:46.000
What? Why go through life unnoticed?

46:56.560 --> 46:59.020
- This store is hideous.
- This store is for old people.

47:00.230 --> 47:02.780
- Yeah.
- No. No.

47:03.230 --> 47:05.560
- This store is kind of Lame.
- It's all used stuff.

47:05.860 --> 47:09.320
Come on you guys. It's so different
from anything else we saw at the mall.

47:09.570 --> 47:11.230
Come on.
Just give it a chance.

47:20.500 --> 47:22.090
Hey, you guys.

47:25.670 --> 47:27.920
- It's old-fashioned, but it works.
- I don't know.

47:28.210 --> 47:30.550
I love vintage.

47:31.720 --> 47:33.810
Look at these sleeves.

47:43.270 --> 47:44.810
Sorry.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.800
Okay, we've got three hours
till Last Splash, so quick review?

48:17.100 --> 48:18.350
- Dresses?
- Check.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.560
- Blue highlights?
- Big check.

48:20.850 --> 48:23.430
- Are we missing anything?
- Wait.

48:23.730 --> 48:25.110
I don't have earrings.

48:25.400 --> 48:29.320
- How could I not have earrings?
- I have earrings. Don't worry.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.790
Pretty, and pointy?

48:37.740 --> 48:39.950
What am I supposed to do with this?

48:40.250 --> 48:42.710
Like, stick it through my skin?

48:43.000 --> 48:46.710
- That's what you do.
- You're so primitive.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.960
I wear stick-ons.
You mean clip-ons?

48:49.380 --> 48:50.680
No.

48:52.510 --> 48:55.230
You'll love these.
They're my favorite aquatic accessory.

48:55.550 --> 48:57.130
You see that buoy out there?

48:57.430 --> 49:00.730
I need you to swim out there
and find me a couple of starfish about...

49:02.520 --> 49:04.190
- this big?
- Live starfish.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.400
That's what you wear for earrings?

49:06.690 --> 49:07.940
They compliment me.

49:08.230 --> 49:11.020
Aqua, I've got earrings
that'll complement you just fine.

49:11.320 --> 49:14.120
No, I mean, they literally
give me compliments.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.730
In my ear.
They talk to me.

49:16.030 --> 49:18.860
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.040
They love to give compliments.

49:21.330 --> 49:23.880
But it's nice
when you need a little boost.

49:24.160 --> 49:26.040
Okay, you guys. Let's go.

49:26.330 --> 49:29.660
Hailey, I can't. You've got to do this.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.290
Do you see how far that buoy is?
No.

49:32.590 --> 49:35.050
Don't worry about it.
I'll get you a ride.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.980
No way.

49:56.110 --> 49:58.780
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

49:59.070 --> 50:01.110
Hi, guys.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.170
Watch the legs, guys.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.640
- Claire, look at that.
- Hi.

50:07.670 --> 50:11.340
Oh, my goodness.
Claire, you have to do this with me.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.260
You go.

50:17.550 --> 50:19.050
Have fun.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.640
Okay. All right.

50:27.350 --> 50:29.100
Are you sure?

50:29.440 --> 50:30.860
Yeah.

50:47.460 --> 50:49.670
Claire, look at me.

50:51.380 --> 50:53.720
Way to go, Hails.

51:02.890 --> 51:05.440
- Hailey.
- Hi, guys!

51:10.520 --> 51:13.980
Don't you just love love?

51:15.820 --> 51:17.160
What?

51:17.780 --> 51:19.330
It's just...

51:19.860 --> 51:21.480
you're so sure of yourself.

51:22.030 --> 51:23.940
Well, I've only seen love
up close once...

51:24.200 --> 51:27.240
but, if you'd seen it the way I did,
you'd feel the same way.

51:27.540 --> 51:29.080
Why?

51:29.500 --> 51:31.960
- What was it like?
- It was years ago.

51:32.250 --> 51:34.750
Not too far from here, actually.

51:35.170 --> 51:39.290
We were migrating through the bay just
like we always do this time of year...

51:40.380 --> 51:43.590
and I saw this couple out sailing
on their little blue boat.

51:44.510 --> 51:46.840
And the way
they looked at each other...

51:47.520 --> 51:51.440
it was a look I'd never seen
anywhere else in the seven seas.

51:52.190 --> 51:55.440
I've wanted someone
to look at me that way ever since.

51:56.110 --> 51:59.870
I looked for them every year,
but I never saw them again.

52:00.280 --> 52:05.370
- Was there a name on the boat?
- I don't remember, Claire.

52:06.410 --> 52:07.660
Oh, the Claire de Lune.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.710
Those were my parents.

52:17.550 --> 52:19.840
Claire, they really loved each other.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.710
I don't think they would have
wanted you to be afraid of life.

52:26.930 --> 52:29.800
I think they would have wanted you
to be friends with it.

52:32.270 --> 52:35.030
- Yeah.
- Hey, I found some.

52:35.310 --> 52:38.600
- A matching set.
- Hailey.

52:46.490 --> 52:48.650
It was the most incredible thing ever.

52:48.950 --> 52:50.660
Something I wish I had
done with you.

52:50.910 --> 52:52.590
- Aqua. Aqua.
- There you go.

52:52.660 --> 52:54.910
- Oh, Aqua.
- And one for you.

52:55.210 --> 52:56.460
Thank you.

52:56.710 --> 53:01.260
- Aquamarine is so lovely.
- Oh, stop.

53:01.550 --> 53:03.390
She makes us so lovely...

53:03.680 --> 53:07.720
just being near such loveliness.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.720
And she's smart.

53:09.970 --> 53:13.930
- Smart, yes, like tuna.
- Like tuna.

53:14.230 --> 53:17.360
We love being near Aqua.

53:17.650 --> 53:19.610
Aqua-Aqua.

53:21.070 --> 53:24.530
- Look who it is.
- Wow. The blue hair is spreading.

53:24.950 --> 53:27.160
You guys look like
the Grandma Brigade.

53:28.070 --> 53:30.860
What's next, dentures or Depends?

53:31.160 --> 53:34.160
What's next is I'm going with Raymond
to the Last Splash.

53:34.870 --> 53:36.120
I've got some advice.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.300
You need to separate fantasy
from reality.

53:39.590 --> 53:41.840
Ray's going to the Last Splash
with Cecilia.

53:42.130 --> 53:44.670
- She asked him at the Street Fair.
- What?

53:45.970 --> 53:49.470
Love to stay and chat, but
we're Late for Cecelia's pre-party.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.510
I've got some advice for you too.

54:01.570 --> 54:02.950
Put on a dry shirt.

54:04.690 --> 54:07.230
- That was totally amazing.
- That was great.

54:09.370 --> 54:10.830
It's Ray.

54:11.660 --> 54:15.710
I can't believe I was so stupid.
Why would he choose her over me?

54:16.120 --> 54:19.160
You're supposed to know him.
He obviously doesn't like me at all.

54:19.460 --> 54:22.970
- That's not possible.
- I never should've trusted you.

54:23.250 --> 54:26.710
- He's into you. This doesn't make sense.
- Bull shark.

54:27.010 --> 54:30.140
- Forget it. I'm going home.
- Aqua, no.

54:30.430 --> 54:32.140
- Wait.
- Claire.

54:32.430 --> 54:36.470
This is totally, completely,
eternally over.

54:36.980 --> 54:38.610
I'm moving.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.240
I'm going to be the new girl again.

54:45.150 --> 54:46.980
You know what. No.

54:47.570 --> 54:48.860
No, we're gonna split up.

54:49.160 --> 54:51.200
You're gonna go stop Aqua, and...

54:51.490 --> 54:53.360
and I'm gonna go find Raymond.
Okay?

54:53.660 --> 54:55.870
Meet me back at the club
as soon as possible.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.280
Hurry. Go.

55:18.730 --> 55:20.860
Aqua, don't do it.

55:22.900 --> 55:24.400
Don't do it.

55:26.030 --> 55:29.160
- Aqua, you can't do this.
- Why not?

55:29.450 --> 55:33.080
I'm never going to see him again.
You know what? He doesn't care.

55:33.740 --> 55:36.030
I'm just gonna go home.
This was all for nothing.

55:36.290 --> 55:38.120
It was not for nothing.
It was for love.

55:38.410 --> 55:40.070
You know what I think of love?

55:40.370 --> 55:41.700
Love stinks.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.800
No wonder we don't have it
back home.

55:45.500 --> 55:48.370
- Please don't give up yet.
- Why? Because of your wish?

55:49.880 --> 55:51.960
Let me tell you something.

55:52.890 --> 55:55.100
My dad said he loved me.

55:55.390 --> 55:57.730
He said he loved my mother
and then he left us.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.310
He left us for some other woman...

56:01.190 --> 56:04.360
but I guess that's the way it is,
and love doesn't always work.

56:05.770 --> 56:08.060
I don't understand.

56:09.110 --> 56:10.360
That's life.

56:10.650 --> 56:13.570
That's how it is here.
But, when you find love...

56:13.870 --> 56:16.950
I guess it's really beautiful.
That's what I've read.

56:17.240 --> 56:19.530
And I don't know as much
about it as I say I do...

56:19.830 --> 56:22.590
but I know that there's a reason
why everybody wants it.

56:22.830 --> 56:24.080
And what's that?

56:27.750 --> 56:29.830
It's the closest thing
we have to magic.

56:33.430 --> 56:35.390
Don't give up yet.

56:40.020 --> 56:43.520
Oh, my God,
what's happening to me?

56:44.850 --> 56:46.310
I'm leaking.

56:47.730 --> 56:50.690
- Aqua, you're crying.
- I'm leaking salt water.

56:50.990 --> 56:52.410
I'm falling apart.

56:52.900 --> 56:56.070
No, they're tears. Your body
makes them when you cry.

56:56.450 --> 56:59.500
I guess you wouldn't have them,
living underwater.

57:00.540 --> 57:02.960
This is crazy
Next you're going to tell me...

57:03.250 --> 57:05.590
water shoots out of your nose
when you're happy.

57:07.630 --> 57:09.510
Only occasionally.

57:16.390 --> 57:17.640
Nice bike.

57:21.060 --> 57:23.860
Time for a swim.

57:27.860 --> 57:29.490
Excuse me.

57:38.410 --> 57:41.960
- How could you do this to Aqua?
- Do what?

57:42.250 --> 57:45.710
Take Cecilia to the Last Splash
after you already asked Aquamarine?

57:46.000 --> 57:50.170
Yeah, well, that was before
I found out that she has a boyfriend.

57:50.630 --> 57:52.050
- A boyfriend?
- Yeah.

57:52.340 --> 57:56.010
The one she practically jumped
overboard for to watch the sunset.

57:56.300 --> 57:59.090
Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend.
Who told you that?

58:01.890 --> 58:05.770
Vince. Vince.
The little girl wants to go in.

58:06.350 --> 58:08.720
- I want to go in where?
- Into the pool.

58:09.020 --> 58:11.020
No, put me down.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.450
- Vince, don't, man. Don't. Stop.
- Put me down.

58:13.730 --> 58:15.270
- Put me down!
- Man, put her down.

58:15.570 --> 58:17.650
Okay, okay.

58:18.530 --> 58:20.690
Jeez, relax. What's the big drama?

58:22.240 --> 58:23.490
Whatever.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.290
God, take a joke.

58:35.670 --> 58:38.670
Take a joke? What's the matter
with you? She's scared.

58:39.340 --> 58:41.260
She was trying to get attention.
Hello.

58:41.550 --> 58:43.510
No, that's your job,
isn't it, Cecilia?

58:46.560 --> 58:48.730
Raymond, I was kidding.

58:49.150 --> 58:50.820
Joke. Hello.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.740
Claire. Claire, hold on.

58:57.950 --> 58:59.580
You okay?

59:00.320 --> 59:03.900
Look, you know where I can find Aqua?
I really need to talk to her.

59:06.290 --> 59:09.840
Yeah? Is that a nod?
I know I see a nod.

59:11.210 --> 59:13.970
This next one's
for the brokenhearted out there.

59:17.090 --> 59:18.640
Mm.

59:24.970 --> 59:26.390
Who needs Raymond?

59:26.680 --> 59:31.600
I found two new men to love
and their names are Ben and Jerry.

59:40.450 --> 59:44.750
Raymond. Who needs Raymond?
I need some salt.

59:45.410 --> 59:47.540
I don't know what Cecilia
was talking about.

59:50.330 --> 59:53.500
I think they're in here.
In my room.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.590
Oh, gosh.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.090
- Hey.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.060
How's it going?

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.130
Bad. No, good. Fine.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.840
Just wait on the balcony,
and we'll be out in a sec.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.140
What are you doing?

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.240
What was he doing here?

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.280
Cecilia told him Aqua had a boyfriend.

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:25.830
That... That barnacle.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.660
But Raymond wants to talk to you.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.960
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:49.930
- You know what?
- Then the fish attacked me.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.470
- It attacked you?
- Yeah.

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.610
- Kind of like a penguin.
- Later, guys.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:56.180
- Oh, hey.
- Thanks for coming.

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.990
Guess who's got a date
to the Last Splash?

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.050
Me.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.530
Gently catch it. You break
your balloon, you're out.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.950
Okay, now toss it again.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.410
The idea is to keep
stepping back as you go.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.620
Come on, people, you
could win a date with me.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.200
Good throw, man.
You ready for the heater?

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.800
Oh, watch out. Be careful.
Heavy-handed.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.960
We go under, not over.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.330
Okay, take a step back.

01:02:17.770 --> 01:02:18.970
Ray, you're out.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.480
Come on, off you go.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.830
I think I feel seasick...

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:34.120
- but in a good way.
- Just be yourself.

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:35.610
Minus the tail.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:06.240
- Wow, you look pretty.
- So do you.

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:09.780
Thank you.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:13.570
- What about we grab something to eat?
- Yes, I'm good at that.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:15.990
Okay.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.620
Here they come.

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.330
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.250
- Come on.
- What can I get you?

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:40.480
- I think I see where they went.
- Where?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.650
There they are!

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:59.240
- Is that good?
- Yes. It's very calming.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.910
Okay. I'll try some.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.810
- No.
- That's good.

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:19.260
To new things.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.450
Oh, sorry.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.870
Guess that's
an acquired taste, huh?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.700
They're having a genius time.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.790
- You look really pretty, honey.
- Thanks.

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:51.630
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:54.060
I see you and Claire
have made a new friend.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.170
Yeah, how about that? Another
person I get to say goodbye to.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.220
Ginny. Oh, Ginny.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.400
I just read about you in the Tribune.

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:08.940
You didn't tell me you were one of,
what, 200 applicants. What an honor.

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:11.560
I've been trying to land a grant
for 10 years.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.690
I just hope we can do
some good with it.

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:15.660
Only the fish will know for sure.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.660
Aren't you happy for your mom?

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:20.460
Ecstatic.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.500
Come on.

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:27.910
Don't worry, honey.
You know how kids are.

01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:34.380
So, if you could travel anywhere
in the world, where would you go?

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.720
That's easy. I would go to Fiji.
I hear it's amazing.

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:40.880
- It is. It's unbelievable.
- You've been there?

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.360
Well, I've been to lots of places.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.180
But I've learned it's not
where you are, it's who you're with.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.940
- You always so sure of everything?
- Yes.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:00.570
- More people should be like that.
- Well, some of us are only human.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.500
Thank you.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.180
Hey, how you doing?
Wow, thanks.

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:17.560
Can you play Weezer's
"Island in the Sun"?

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.300
Please?

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.840
Yeah, sure, we can do that.
I love that song.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.480
Hi, everyone. We'd like to start
things off with a special request.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.560
I love this song.
You want to dance?

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.040
I want to, but I don't know how.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.150
What? It's easy. I'll show you.
Come on.

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.740
Come on.
You can't be worse than me.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.100
I told you I was bad.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.570
No, you're great, you're great.
That's okay.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.020
Here. You ever spend any time
in the water?

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.950
Some. You know.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.750
Right. Okay.
So, you just got to kind of...

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.870
let the music carry you.
You know, just like a wave would.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.710
Wavy, yeah.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.750
There you go.
Yeah. There you go. Nice.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.090
I'll be right back.

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:20.930
Back off. Don't make a bigger fool
of yourself than you already have.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.930
Walk away.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:38.069
Bye.

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:42.580
Good job.

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.240
- He's so into her.
- He likes her.

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:25.569
Thank you, Capri Beach Club.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.200
Sunset. Come on.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.010
Dancing with you is...

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.060
better than anything
I've ever done on feet.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.680
Say goodbye.
It's time to go.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.360
- I have to go.
- What? Again?

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:01.110
Come on, at least stay for the fireworks.
Come on.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.610
There's going to be fireworks?

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:09.120
I can't. I wish I could.
I really do.

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:13.370
But you leave tomorrow.
I want to spend more time with you.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.460
What can I say to make you stay?

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.670
You can tell me...

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.630
- What? Tell you what?
- Aqua, we have to go right now!

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.680
Tomorrow. Tomorrow you can tell me.
Come to the pier at 9:00.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:29.720
And tell you what?

01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.990
- You tell me how that makes you feel.
- Come on!

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.320
I can't believe that I'm not that...
What?

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:01.090
Come on, Hails.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.310
Whoo!

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.570
Okay, you little freaks.
What are you doing here?

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:35.150
I want to go back to the
party. They're handing out sparklers.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.230
She lives in a water tower.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.680
Freak city.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.930
This is so Lame.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.150
And who cares?

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:52.870
I'm tired of sitting here staring at it.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.040
Yeah, Cecilia.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.360
We already missed the fireworks
and now we're missing the party.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:02.750
Patty, could you put away
the negativity...

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.670
like you put away all the corn dogs
at the Street Fair?

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:12.010
I'm going up.
If anyone comes, honk.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.480
But, I only had two.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.600
Who needs this?

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.170
Here we go.

01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:52.220
What are you up to?

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.860
Just a place to call your own.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.520
As we drift into the zone.

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.440
Hailey?

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.950
Is someone there?

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:42.260
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:45.720
Wait! Cecilia.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.280
Okay, okay.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.790
Nice and slow.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.080
She's a... She's a...

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.210
She's a... She's a... She's a...

01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:43.570
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:03.300
I need to see your hand stamp.
Thank you.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.140
Night!

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.270
- Can I see your hand stamp, please?
- This is my hand stamp.

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.150
- You know who I am.
- I'm sorry, Cecilia.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.280
Has grilling burgers fried your brain...

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.520
or do you grill all day
because you have no brain? Excuse me.

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:20.160
- Girls. Girls, girls, girls.
- Cecilia.

01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:22.030
Aquamarine. She's a mermaid.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.110
She has...
She has scales and everything.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.420
She has a big, fat tail!
That's why she lives in the water tower.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.700
Whoa! You need to slow it way down.

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.490
- What are you talking about?
- You sound a little crazy.

01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:35.710
No, no, no. I'm not crazy.
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.040
- You're freaking us out.
- There's no mermaid.

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.850
Why are you looking at me when
there's a mermaid in a water tower?

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.210
There's no mermaid.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.640
Oh, okay, fine. And by the way,
why did you leave me there, huh?

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.940
Do you have any idea
how far I had to walk?

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.030
- She's crazy.
- Why is that funny?

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:05.290
A mermaid.
A big, fat mermaid.

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:58.350
I was quoted for 40 boxes, wasn't I?

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.130
- No, it's 55.
- Fifty-five?

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.380
- Bye, Mom.
- Hey. Be back soon, Hails.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.560
Daddy! Daddy!

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.730
Daddy, it's so horrible.

01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:15.550
I went on my run this morning down by
the water tower and I heard this crying...

01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:19.430
and this poor girl,
I think she's trapped up there!

01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.480
Did you call the police?

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:24.230
I wanted to tell you first.

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:34.870
Come in.

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.500
Will you take care of Moby?

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:48.630
You won't have to go tomorrow.
Believe me.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:55.020
So I was thinking we should meet
at the pier at around 8:45.

01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:57.730
Hail?

01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.070
- Are you listening to me?
- Mm-hm.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.820
Maybe we should think
about the wish.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.900
What do you mean?

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.120
We know
what we're doing with our wish.

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:15.170
You're staying in Bay Bridge.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:20.240
Right. But I was thinking about it
all last night...

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.300
my mom has worked all her life
for this. Maybe it's not fair.

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:31.310
We asked for a miracle, Hailey,
and we got it. We're using it.

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:37.440
Maybe we could wish
for something else, maybe.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.270
Something else?
Like what? Like a new best friend?

01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:46.560
- A new person to tell everything to?
- Claire, no. Stop it.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.440
How can you even think that way?

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:52.120
I'm saying, maybe we'll learn
to stand on our own for a change.

01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:54.960
- You mean me, don't you?
- I mean, I'm not your mom.

01:19:56.870 --> 01:20:01.950
Please. You act like I need
you all the time, when the truth is...

01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:03.910
you're so mad at the world...

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:07.040
that nobody but me
even wants to talk to you.

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:08.840
Oh?

01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:12.920
So you lived here your whole life. How
do you figure that I'm your only friend?

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.760
Huh?

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:25.610
WQDA, the coast's
breaking news channel.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.900
A report just in that a young girl
is trapped in the Bay Bridge water tower.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.070
We'll be going live to Storm Banks,
the man on the scene.

01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:38.040
This is Storm Banks reporting live
from Bay Bridge water tower...

01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:41.170
where an unidentified girl
has been trapped.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.750
Firefighters are racing against time
to rescue...

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:47.170
- this woman from a watery grave.
- Hailey, wait!

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.250
Hailey, wait! Hailey!

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.110
- How'd you find this?
- I was on my morning run.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:07.390
All of a sudden, I heard this horrible
screaming. I didn't know what to do.

01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:12.730
I did the first thing that came to mind,
which was to inform the newscast.

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.830
And we can only hope
that we find her.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.530
- The ladder's gone.
- Oh, no.

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:21.210
I just did what any good citizen
would have done.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.920
We can only hope
that they'll pull her out in time...

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:27.130
so she can be reunited
with her friends and loved ones.

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.420
Hey. He's got something.

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:31.080
Okay, guys. Showtime.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:38.130
Okay, you getting this?

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.020
We got a floater.

01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:48.530
No. That's not possible.
No, she's up there.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.200
- Okay, sweetie.
- She's up there.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.530
They know what's going on.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.740
- They know what's going on.
- Yeah, I know.

01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:58.740
Tell them how she's up there.

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:01.110
She's probably still hiding
under the water.

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:02.950
- Go to commercial.
- Daddy.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.620
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.620
- Go to commercial.
- Mermaid. Mermaid.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.240
- Go to commercial, now.
- Fins and everything.

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.920
Are we out?
You've got to be kidding me.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.560
Give me your keys.

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:21.260
- No, Dad. No.
- Cecilia.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.020
- No, no, no. No!
- Cecilia!

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.180
Give me your car keys. Now.

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.870
While you're walking to school
every day...

01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:40.860
you can figure out
why you need so much attention.

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.170
- Where could she be?
- I don't know. Let's go.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.010
That's a wrap... on my career.

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:56.050
- But, Daddy, my car.
- Yeah, save it, Cecilia.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:23:00.170
You know why?
Because she is a mermaid.

01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:01.720
Go to commercial.

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:10.600
There's not usually a man with a Ladder
around when you need him.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:14.070
- I can't thank you enough.
- I guess I could say the same to you.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.620
You're the first one
who talked to me all summer.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.280
Well, at least nicely.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.030
I appreciate that.

01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:37.550
You're a long way from home,
aren't you?

01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:44.230
Thank you.

01:23:55.690 --> 01:24:00.230
You know, when you help a mermaid,
you get a wish.

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.710
It's almost 9:30 and she's not here.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.360
- Where could she be?
- Don't say it's my fault.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.000
- There's Ray.
- I can see that, thanks.

01:24:18.090 --> 01:24:22.140
- What is your problem?
- I'm not giving up this wish.

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:35.110
She's here.

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.860
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.040
I...

01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:46.330
I thought about you all night.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.280
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:55.910
So? What was it that you...
wanted to tell me?

01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:57.790
Or ask me? I wasn't sure if...

01:24:58.090 --> 01:25:00.510
Okay. Here it goes.

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.420
The last couple of days
have been amazing.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.270
Yeah, but wait.
Before we get to that...

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:11.440
could you maybe give me
like a 20-minute warning...

01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:14.690
you know,
before the part where you run away?

01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:17.650
Don't worry.
I don't have to leave yet.

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:22.360
Cool. Because, I was thinking
maybe we could go kite surfing.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.780
Like, there's this really, really
awesome place right down the shore.

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:28.030
The waves are small,
but the wave itself...

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:30.290
Wait.
Breaks on the cove...

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.580
it sprays up into the air and you can
always see a rainbow.

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:36.750
- It's cool... If you're into that.
- We're losing them. She's gonna ask.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.040
- I'm into that kind of thing.
- I can't hear.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.750
Come on, let's go up top.

01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:44.220
- That's if you want to do that.
- I want to.

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:49.060
Cool. Because, afterwards,
I know this great little...

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.730
Actually it's a total dive...

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.560
but they have the best hot dogs ever,
I swear.

01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:55.060
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:59.890
- I have to ask you something.
- Right, right. Yeah. Okay. Shoot.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:05.150
I came here looking for something
I wasn't even sure existed.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.910
But...

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.960
then I met you
and now I have to ask you.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.700
Ask me.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.080
- Try the binoculars.
- Don't yell at me.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.840
- Raymond?
- Yeah?

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.220
Do you love me?

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.970
Well.

01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:39.890
I mean, we've had one date.

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:44.610
- What's going on?
- Don't get me wrong.

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:47.520
Don't get me wrong.
I like you. I really, really like you.

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:52.700
Wait, I think he's reaching out for her.
That's a good sign. Look.

01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.990
I mean, I think you're smart,
and beautiful...

01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:58.870
and different than anyone
I've ever met...

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:01.170
and I'd like to see a lot
more of you.

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.750
But...

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.840
you don't love me.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.420
- She's puling away.
- Let me see what's going on.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.720
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.800
Are you crying?

01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:19.770
Yes. Apparently, it's something I do.

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:21.640
I don't understand.

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:25.030
Why do I have to be in love with you
today? Why can't we just...

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.570
work our way there?

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.740
I have a better idea. Why doesn't she
just go back to where she came from?

01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:35.790
- Oh, no!
- Aqua!

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.750
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.270
Oh, my God.

01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:07.400
Raymond! Raymond!

01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:11.070
Just stay calm. Don't fight the
current. I'll be right there.

01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:15.440
He still chooses her over me?

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.910
She's a fish!

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.830
Aqua. Aqua, we're coming!
Her dad's puling her back.

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:29.210
I'm going to get my rescue board.

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.760
- We can't just let her go.
- I'm going in.

01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.670
No.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.260
Not without me you're not.

01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:01.700
Hailey.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.090
Hailey.

01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:06.260
- Come on.
- Hailey.

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:10.140
Grab the buoy.
We'll meet you there.

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.730
I'm right here. I won't leave you.

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:20.970
- Hailey, I can't.
- Keep your eye on the buoy.

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:23.220
Don't stop.

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.490
I'm coming.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.580
- Grab my hand.
- Hailey.

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.230
You can do it.

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:41.460
I can't believe you two.
It's not safe out here.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:45.090
- The storm's too strong.
- Why is your dad pulling you back now?

01:29:45.370 --> 01:29:50.160
- He can't just take you away.
- Yes, he can. That was our deal.

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.790
Take our wish.

01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:54.260
And you can stay here.

01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:58.600
I can't.

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:03.270
Yeah, take it.
And you can call off your wedding.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.940
- But there's no wish.
- What?

01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:09.740
Raymond doesn't love me.

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:11.730
My father was right.

01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:14.620
I couldn't prove love exists.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.400
I'm so sorry.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.370
- Can't we do something?
- Yeah, anything.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.330
What more could you do for me?

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:25.570
You jumped in the water to save me.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.590
And now you'd give me your wish?

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.050
Why would you do that for me?

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.090
I don't know.
It's what I would do for her...

01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:38.260
and I know she'd do it for me,
and just...

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:41.720
- because we love you, Aqua.
- You do?

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:53.310
I didn't know you leak
when you're happy too.

01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:04.780
Look.

01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:16.470
Your dad's letting you go.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:19.390
- Because of you.
- What?

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:24.770
Don't you see?
You just proved to him that love exists.

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.360
I guess you get a wish after all.
Any requests?

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.120
Can we wish for you
to stay here forever?

01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:43.820
I'm a mermaid, Claire.

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:47.000
I have a family out there
that needs me.

01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:50.660
As much as I want to stay,
I belong in the ocean.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.800
Most of the time.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.890
Save your wish, okay?
I promise I'll come back to visit.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:04.560
And if I have to swim against
the Gulf Stream from here to Australia...

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.560
I'll do it.

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.900
I'd circle the world for you two.

01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:30.490
So I guess this is it, right?

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:36.090
Someone's got to go back
and return all those wedding gifts.

01:32:37.670 --> 01:32:39.790
We're going to miss you, Aqua.

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.050
You can always call me on my shell.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.060
I want you guys to have these.

01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:57.640
Thanks.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:01.370
Starfish may be big suck-ups...

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.580
but they never lie.

01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:16.370
- Aqua.
- I love you guys too.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.630
Aqua. Aqua.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.470
- Oh, my God! Keep in touch, fish-butt.
- We want a full report.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.760
I'll see you soon.

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.350
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.480
Bye.

01:33:40.730 --> 01:33:42.440
- Race you to the pier.
- No, wait.

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:47.900
Let's just float a while.
I want to enjoy this.

01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:50.790
Has this been the best summer ever
or what?

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.920
Just wait till next summer,
when you visit me in Australia.

01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:56.170
If I can swing that
with my allowance.

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:58.130
Claire...

01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.550
we still have our wish.

01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:01.420
Oh, my God.

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:03.130
You know what, Hailey?

01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:05.960
It's good to have friends with fins.

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:07.970
Hey!

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.300
Wait up.

01:34:12.850 --> 01:34:15.930
Wow, I can't... I can't...
I can't believe it.

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:20.070
They didn't exactly cover this
in lifeguard training.

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.160
I know. I should have told you.
I hope you're not... mad.

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.320
No. No, I'm not mad.
Surprised, definitely.

01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.700
And confused
about a couple of things.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.510
Like for one,
the fact that you have a tail.

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:41.800
Yeah. I do.

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.290
A very nice one, by the way.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:47.930
I know.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.430
Are you planning to surface
anytime soon?

01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.560
That sounds...
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:04.560
I'm not sure how to ask
a mermaid out.

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:06.370
But I'd like to see you again.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.580
If that's allowed or even possible.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.070
Well, I have to swim back for a bit.

01:35:15.370 --> 01:35:17.570
Clear the water with my dad.

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:20.250
Would you mind waiting a little while?

01:35:21.170 --> 01:35:23.720
Maybe you could meet me
in Fiji sometime.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.410
- Leonard?
- Good day, ladies!

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.910
Hey, girls.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.170
- That's really sweet.
- I'm really happy for them.

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.750
Hailey. Claire.

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:04.670
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:09.890
Look, I just had to tell you guys thanks.
You're both...

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.590
You're both extraordinary.

01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:15.470
Don't know if I could've
done what you did.

01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:28.610
See you.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.460
Oh, my God.

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.340
Oh, my goodness.

01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.500
I'll see you soon?

01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:53.670
I'm going to miss you so much.

01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:57.480
I know. I'm going to miss you too.

01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:10.650
Hailey is so beautiful, inside and out.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.860
She's the best friend
you could ever have.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.250
Claire is so courageous.

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:21.870
Claire has a true heart.
She understands a true friend.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.290
She will never let you down.

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.210
She glows from the inside.
