WEBVTT

01:22.749 --> 01:24.376
The forests of Pandora...

01:25.169 --> 01:26.628
hold many dangers.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.803
But the most dangerous thing...

01:34.928 --> 01:35.721
about Pandora...

01:40.559 --> 01:42.811
is that you may grow
to love her too much.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.784
We sing the songcords to remember.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
Each bead...

02:00.537 --> 02:01.496
a story
in our life.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.667
A bead for the
birth of our son.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.798
Neteyam!

02:12.591 --> 02:13.759
Neteyam!

02:21.099 --> 02:21.725
A bead...

02:21.850 --> 02:24.061
when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.189
Born of Grace's avatar.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.651
A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.

02:45.541 --> 02:46.166
A bead...

02:46.291 --> 02:47.626
for the first
communion with Eywa.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.131
The People say...

02:53.257 --> 02:54.091
we live
in Eywa...

02:56.051 --> 02:57.886
and Eywa
lives in us.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.266
The Great Mother...

03:02.391 --> 03:03.684
holds all her children...

03:03.809 --> 03:04.560
in her heart.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.945
Happiness is simple.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.533
But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.545
Before I knew it,
we had four.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.968
When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...

03:38.135 --> 03:39.595
a few of 'em stayed.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.139
Science guys,
loyal to the Na'vi.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.225
And then
there was Spider.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.227
He was just stuck here.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.979
Too young
for a cryo-capsule.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.814
You little wild man.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.565
See you, Norm!

03:51.690 --> 03:52.441
Orphaned by the war...

03:52.608 --> 03:54.067
he was raised
by the lab guys.

03:54.193 --> 03:54.860
Spider, take
your spare!

03:54.985 --> 03:56.403
I'm just going
to the village!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.531
He wasn't
part of our family.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.949
He was like a stray cat.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.117
Just always around.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.621
Inseparable
from our kids.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.751
To Neytiri...

04:10.918 --> 04:12.211
he would
always be alien.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
One of them.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.268
Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.437
But now
when I hear it...

04:30.562 --> 04:31.563
it might as well be English.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.023
I hate you!

04:33.857 --> 04:36.401
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

04:36.652 --> 04:37.653
Penis face!

04:37.819 --> 04:39.655
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.823
Don't make me
come over there.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.368
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.786
There he is.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.790
There you go.
Go get it!

04:49.915 --> 04:50.541
Yeah!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.919
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.420
There you go. Good boy.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.009
Wow, that's a big one.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.177
By the rocks.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.513
Right where
you said.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.348
How tall is he?

05:06.515 --> 05:08.350
-He's... that tall.
-He's tall!

05:08.517 --> 05:09.726
Goes by
too fast.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.395
Like a dream.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.398
-Kiri.
-Bro, come on.

05:14.565 --> 05:15.566
Come on.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.651
Smile, skxawng.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.070
Happiness is simple.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.533
Like date night.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.410
Time away from the kids.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.985
But the thing
about happiness...

06:02.404 --> 06:03.780
it can vanish
in a heartbeat.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.164
A new star in the night.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.375
It could only mean one thing.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.135
Ships. Decelerating.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.771
And Sky
People returning.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.714
Pulse 168.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.924
Yeah, here it comes.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.092
You're just fine.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.718
Just lie still.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.220
Stay calm.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.432
Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.725
Get that out of his face.

09:19.309 --> 09:19.935
Colonel...

09:20.853 --> 09:21.562
can you hear me?

09:21.979 --> 09:22.604
Colonel?

09:25.858 --> 09:27.192
You need to lie
back down, sir.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.782
Sedate him!

09:33.991 --> 09:34.908
Get outta here.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.159
Go, go, go!

09:36.451 --> 09:37.119
Get security!

09:37.286 --> 09:38.287
-Grab him!

09:39.580 --> 09:40.497
Hold him!

09:40.622 --> 09:41.248
Calm down!

09:41.415 --> 09:42.416
Colonel,
stand down!

09:42.749 --> 09:43.375
Colonel...

09:43.500 --> 09:44.126
it's me!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.502
Corporal Wainfleet!

09:49.464 --> 09:50.465
Lyle?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.051
That you?

09:53.552 --> 09:55.971
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.307
And Fike.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.978
I'm all right.
Let me go.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.771
I'm all right.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.169
Well...

10:28.420 --> 10:30.297
ain't this a bitch.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.769
Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.189
All right. Umbilical's clear.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.608
Pulse ox 89.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.821
In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.616
Only younger,
taller, bluer...

10:57.741 --> 10:59.326
and not nearly
as good-lookin'.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.079
In two hours,
I fly a mission...

11:02.204 --> 11:03.956
against the
Na'vi's stronghold.

11:04.122 --> 11:08.877
The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.213
And if you are
watchin' it, well...

11:11.380 --> 11:13.465
it means that I did
get my ticket punched.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.677
Hey, Parker...

11:17.052 --> 11:18.846
just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.848
Just remind him
how this works.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.808
Here.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.894
So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.354
We're gonna send
this back to Earth...

11:27.521 --> 11:29.857
where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.608
We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...

11:31.733 --> 11:32.359
Hey, hey, hey.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.111
Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?

11:34.236 --> 11:35.195
Hurry it up.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.197
Anyway,
the idea...

11:37.322 --> 11:41.118
is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.496
Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...

11:45.289 --> 11:47.332
and your humble
narrator into...

11:47.499 --> 11:49.042
recombinant bodies.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.336
You're a
recom now, Colonel...

11:51.461 --> 11:53.881
loaded with my
memories and my charm.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.800
What you won't
remember is my death...

11:56.967 --> 11:58.302
because it
hasn't happened yet...

11:58.802 --> 12:00.012
and it ain't gonna.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.597
-Damn right.
-Hell yeah.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.307
Well, whatever happened...

12:04.725 --> 12:07.561
if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.022
And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.

12:13.859 --> 12:14.860
Remember, kid...

12:15.611 --> 12:17.070
a Marine
can't be defeated.

12:17.863 --> 12:18.989
Oh, you can kill us...

12:19.823 --> 12:21.533
but we'll just
regroup in hell.

12:22.993 --> 12:23.994
Semper fi.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.982
Ground team, go!

13:47.953 --> 13:49.204
Take this! Go!

13:54.042 --> 13:55.627
Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.884
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.094
No way!
Dad will skin us!

14:04.261 --> 14:06.013
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.431
Lo'ak!

14:07.681 --> 14:09.016
Get back
here, you...

14:12.311 --> 14:13.312
Taking the
whole case!

14:13.478 --> 14:15.022
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.652
Bro, let's go. Come on!

14:21.028 --> 14:21.862
Okay, let's go!

14:23.947 --> 14:24.948
Move! Take that!

14:25.866 --> 14:26.575
Take these weapons.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.326
Here, boy. Go!

14:29.786 --> 14:31.121
You don't even
know how to use it.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.916
Dad taught me.

14:41.882 --> 14:42.758
Gunship's
inbound!

14:50.724 --> 14:51.725
Bro, come on!

15:01.944 --> 15:03.237
Lo'ak, where are you?

15:03.362 --> 15:04.112
Neteyam!

15:05.280 --> 15:06.740
Easy, easy, you okay?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.492
-Yeah.
-Where's your brother?

15:09.201 --> 15:10.327
-That way.
-Where is he? Where?

15:10.494 --> 15:11.245
Get outta here!

15:11.370 --> 15:11.995
Go on!

15:13.205 --> 15:14.206
Neteyam!

15:16.750 --> 15:17.751
Oh, no.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.463
Oh, no, no, no.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.215
Oh, God.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.471
Dad?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.476
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

15:35.561 --> 15:36.562
I'm sorry.

15:38.397 --> 15:39.439
I'm sorry, sir.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.863
We are not in Kansas anymore.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.699
We are going to Pandora.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.993
Now...

15:51.577 --> 15:54.955
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.084
Why so blue?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.007
For our sins
in our past life...

16:05.215 --> 16:06.049
we have been
brought back...

16:06.175 --> 16:08.468
in the form
of our enemy.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.556
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.975
And with
our training...

16:15.392 --> 16:16.894
that's a pretty
potent mix.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.980
Do we have a
mission yet?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.356
Indeed
we do.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.818
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

16:24.985 --> 16:26.904
the leader of the
Na'vi insurgency.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.908
The one they call
Toruk Makto.

16:31.575 --> 16:32.826
Jake Sully.

16:32.993 --> 16:33.952
Yeah!

16:41.710 --> 16:43.212
Attack, attack!

16:44.129 --> 16:45.380
Got ya!

16:45.547 --> 16:46.298
Tuk!

16:46.423 --> 16:47.049
Come on!

16:47.549 --> 16:49.051
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

16:49.218 --> 16:50.219
Skxawng.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.386
No, seriously.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.596
And the animals
respect me more.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.264
They don't think
of me as human.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.141
Wait.
You're human?

17:06.318 --> 17:07.319
They're
coming!

17:12.616 --> 17:13.575
They're coming!

17:13.700 --> 17:14.701
Kiri, Spider!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.744
The war party's
coming back!

17:16.912 --> 17:18.163
Come on,
come on.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.705
Let's go,
come on.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.389
-Mom!
-Tuk...

17:35.556 --> 17:37.099
-Mom.
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.185
Fall in.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.481
You're supposed
to be spotters.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.316
You spot bogeys,
and you call 'em in.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.526
From a
distance!

17:48.026 --> 17:49.778
Does any of this
sound familiar? Get here!

17:50.445 --> 17:52.364
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

17:52.531 --> 17:54.199
and you disobey
direct orders.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.536
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

17:57.703 --> 17:58.704
My brother
is wounded.

17:59.121 --> 17:59.872
It's fine.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.707
-Tuk, go with her. Go.
-Dad.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.792
Sir. I take
full responsibility.

18:04.001 --> 18:04.626
Yeah, you do.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.460
That's right.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.338
'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

18:09.423 --> 18:10.549
MaJake.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.843
Your son is
actually bleeding.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.428
Mother,
it's fine. I...

18:16.597 --> 18:18.515
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.149
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.734
Yes, sir.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.613
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.157
Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

18:35.449 --> 18:36.200
Yes, sir.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.910
And get that
crap off your face.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.837
Aw, want a kiss
on the boo-boo?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.005
-Give him this.
-Okay.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.715
I would use yalna bark.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.508
Here, drink.

18:52.591 --> 18:53.258
Oh, you would?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.135
And who
is Tsahik?

18:55.636 --> 18:56.845
You are, Grand... Move!

18:57.304 --> 18:59.681
You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.310
It stings less.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.229
Mighty Warrior.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.196
What?

19:16.657 --> 19:18.867
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

19:20.661 --> 19:21.912
It is very
hard on them.

19:23.622 --> 19:24.831
I know.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.169
You are very
hard on them.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.757
I'm their father.
It's my job.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.386
This is
not a squad.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.054
It is a family.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.817
I thought
we'd lost them.

20:00.701 --> 20:01.785
Hey, man.
How's it going?

20:01.910 --> 20:02.786
Hey, Spider.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.705
Your ass
is mine.

20:04.872 --> 20:05.789
I'm right here.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.708
Avatars only...

20:07.833 --> 20:08.500
go around!

20:09.126 --> 20:10.085
Sorry.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.838
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.132
Yeah, well, I can
still kick your ass.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.636
Hell of a day.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.804
Long run.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.350
Real hysterical,
guys.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.935
You know what
really sucks though?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.228
Is you can breathe
Earth air for hours...

20:28.395 --> 20:30.981
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.525
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.693
For you.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.243
-Hi, Max.
-Hey, kids.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.077
Hey. What's up, Max?

20:44.786 --> 20:45.454
What's up, Norm?

20:51.502 --> 20:52.377
Hi, Ma.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.682
Maybe I'm just losing it out here...

21:05.849 --> 21:07.601
but I'm seeing real evidence...

21:07.726 --> 21:11.480
of a systemic response on a global level.

21:12.231 --> 21:13.315
I can't...

21:14.608 --> 21:17.528
I won't use the term
"intelligence." It's...

21:18.612 --> 21:20.697
maybe "awareness"
is a better word.

21:21.573 --> 21:25.536
It's like the entire
biosphere of Pandora...

21:25.661 --> 21:27.037
is aware...

21:27.204 --> 21:30.290
and capable of this
cognitive response.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.377
Oh, crap,
I can't say that.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.379
They'll
crucify me.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.005
I mean,
I need to say...

21:37.881 --> 21:39.883
So who do you think
knocked her up?

21:40.884 --> 21:41.885
Pretty sure it was Norm.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.053
Totally.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.515
You do not
deserve to live.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.016
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

21:48.183 --> 21:49.476
I mean, he's the
teacher's pet.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.103
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.188
I would
kill myself.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.690
I would
drink acid.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.817
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.236
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

21:59.403 --> 22:00.404
Hey.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.614
See, I'm thinkin'...

22:02.781 --> 22:05.492
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

22:06.118 --> 22:06.910
Gross!

22:07.077 --> 22:07.828
Guys.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.706
I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

22:15.419 --> 22:16.420
Whatever.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.338
Don't even
remember him.

22:18.755 --> 22:19.756
No, Spider.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.717
-Dude.
-Spider...

22:24.136 --> 22:25.554
You are not him.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.764
Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

23:08.931 --> 23:09.973
Do not stop.

23:14.603 --> 23:15.604
Masks off.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.443
Sir...

23:21.568 --> 23:22.945
this is
the General.

23:32.704 --> 23:34.206
General
Ardmore.

23:35.290 --> 23:36.583
Good to meet you, Colonel.

23:37.376 --> 23:38.585
I've heard good things...

23:39.378 --> 23:41.380
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.422
Walk with me.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.594
The new ops
center is over here.

23:47.761 --> 23:48.929
That just came online.

23:49.721 --> 23:52.724
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

23:53.851 --> 23:57.521
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.108
We're not here to
run a mine, Colonel.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.776
As On-World
Commander...

24:02.901 --> 24:04.695
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.285
Earth
is dying.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.789
Our task here is to
tame this frontier.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.667
Nothing less than
to make Pandora...

24:18.792 --> 24:20.043
the new home
for humanity.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.672
But before
we can do that...

24:23.839 --> 24:26.091
we need to
pacify the hostiles.

24:28.886 --> 24:32.014
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.558
His strikes are well-planned.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.394
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

24:38.395 --> 24:42.274
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

24:42.441 --> 24:44.067
cutting off our supply chain.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.820
And they hit a maglev two days ago.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.368
Any intel on Sully's...

24:53.493 --> 24:54.620
base of operations?

24:54.786 --> 24:56.038
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

24:57.998 --> 25:00.959
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

25:03.170 --> 25:06.131
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.302
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

25:11.470 --> 25:13.347
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

25:13.472 --> 25:14.890
they are all over us.

25:17.976 --> 25:18.977
Colonel...

25:19.144 --> 25:22.105
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

25:22.272 --> 25:23.941
and will not trigger...

25:24.066 --> 25:24.858
the immune response.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.861
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

25:28.904 --> 25:29.988
The hard way.

25:31.865 --> 25:32.991
Outstanding.

25:46.755 --> 25:48.382
We're entering
hostile airspace.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.175
Copy that.

26:00.227 --> 26:02.187
-Bro!
-Go, Monkey Boy!

26:02.354 --> 26:04.523
Guys, wait up!

26:41.310 --> 26:42.895
Tuk!
Keep up!

26:43.562 --> 26:44.897
Okay,
okay.

26:45.063 --> 26:46.398
Bro, why'd you
bring her anyway?

26:47.024 --> 26:48.108
She's such
a cry baby.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.736
She's all,
"I'm telling.

26:50.861 --> 26:51.653
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.655
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

26:53.780 --> 26:54.990
Don't pick on her.

26:56.992 --> 26:57.993
Come on.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.621
Oh, sick!

27:01.914 --> 27:03.290
Are there any
dead bodies up there?

27:03.916 --> 27:05.209
Bro, check it out.
Come on.

27:49.628 --> 27:50.629
No shit.

28:00.973 --> 28:02.516
Kiri.

28:02.933 --> 28:03.934
Kiri.

28:06.937 --> 28:07.938
Kiri...

28:08.438 --> 28:09.439
Kiri, hey.

28:09.606 --> 28:10.607
Hey.

28:15.696 --> 28:16.697
Are you okay?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.033
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.244
Yeah, you were.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.079
Kiri!

28:24.246 --> 28:26.290
-Kiri!
-Kiri, we have to get back.

28:26.456 --> 28:27.457
All right,
come on.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.881
What is it?

28:34.756 --> 28:36.884
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.471
It's way too
big for a human.

28:41.638 --> 28:43.015
-Avatars?
-Maybe...

28:44.057 --> 28:45.934
but they're for
sure not ours.

28:47.686 --> 28:48.687
What are you doing?

28:48.854 --> 28:50.147
I'm tracking.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.417
Watch your six.

29:13.504 --> 29:14.546
Clear.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.676
Perimeter
up.

29:32.981 --> 29:33.982
Damn.

29:56.505 --> 29:58.215
We are never supposed to come here.

29:59.842 --> 30:01.134
Dad is going
to ground you.

30:01.593 --> 30:02.511
Can you stop?

30:02.636 --> 30:03.428
For life.

30:04.513 --> 30:05.848
Bro, we have got to
check this out.

30:06.181 --> 30:06.974
Let's go.

30:24.575 --> 30:25.576
Bro...

30:26.159 --> 30:27.619
that's where your dad and my dad...

30:28.495 --> 30:29.496
fought.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.707
That's your
dad's actual suit.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.917
Holy shit.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.587
Lyle,
see if you can...

30:36.837 --> 30:38.672
pull some data
off that dash cam.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.633
That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.593
So were we.

30:42.718 --> 30:43.343
All right.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.387
I gotta call
this in.

30:45.554 --> 30:46.972
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.140
Let's go.

30:52.728 --> 30:55.272
Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.

30:55.772 --> 30:57.524
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

30:57.691 --> 30:58.984
I got eyes
on some guys.

31:00.152 --> 31:02.821
They look
like avatars...

31:03.030 --> 31:05.115
but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.

31:05.866 --> 31:08.160
There's six of them.
Over.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.578
What's your pos?
Over.

31:11.914 --> 31:13.165
We're at
the old shack.

31:16.335 --> 31:17.336
Who's "we"?

31:18.337 --> 31:20.297
Me, Spider, Kiri...

31:22.090 --> 31:23.091
and Tuk.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.516
Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

31:30.682 --> 31:31.683
You pull back
right now.

31:31.808 --> 31:32.726
Do not
make a sound.

31:32.893 --> 31:34.144
You get the
hell out of there.

31:34.269 --> 31:35.062
Move! You copy?

31:35.479 --> 31:36.480
Yes, sir,
moving out.

31:36.605 --> 31:37.231
See,
I told you!

31:37.314 --> 31:37.940
Go, go.

31:38.815 --> 31:39.816
Dad...

31:40.150 --> 31:41.360
I know
a quick way!

31:46.990 --> 31:48.575
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.035
Kiri, stop.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.328
Guys,
come on.

31:51.495 --> 31:52.538
It's almost eclipse,
come on.

31:55.499 --> 31:56.500
Put it down!
Down!

31:57.334 --> 31:58.335
Put it down or
I'll shoot you!

31:58.502 --> 31:59.419
With me.

31:59.586 --> 32:00.212
Drop it!

32:00.295 --> 32:00.921
Right now!

32:02.506 --> 32:04.383
Do not move!
Put your hands up!

32:04.842 --> 32:05.843
Spider.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.053
Get 'em!

32:08.220 --> 32:09.596
Get over here! Come on!

32:10.180 --> 32:11.306
Get down!

32:12.015 --> 32:13.016
Stop fighting.

32:13.684 --> 32:14.726
Don't move!

32:14.893 --> 32:15.894
Check 'em
for weapons!

32:16.520 --> 32:17.521
Kiri!

32:20.649 --> 32:21.275
Shut up.

32:21.358 --> 32:21.984
Don't move.

32:22.818 --> 32:24.069
What have we here?

32:34.121 --> 32:34.997
Hey, Colonel...

32:35.122 --> 32:35.914
check it out.

32:36.456 --> 32:37.457
Four fingers.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.126
We got a half-breed.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.502
Shit...

32:47.092 --> 32:48.343
Show me
your fingers.

32:53.849 --> 32:56.435
You're his,
aren't you?

32:58.562 --> 32:59.897
You're his,
all right.

33:06.695 --> 33:07.779
Where is he?

33:18.957 --> 33:19.958
No!

33:22.127 --> 33:22.753
Really?

33:22.836 --> 33:24.296
You wanna play
it this way?

33:26.215 --> 33:26.840
Shut up!

33:30.719 --> 33:31.470
Kiri!

33:31.595 --> 33:32.346
No!
Stop!

33:32.888 --> 33:34.223
Hey! Hey,
don't touch her!

33:35.224 --> 33:35.933
Hey!

33:36.767 --> 33:37.809
Don't hurt
her, please.

33:40.062 --> 33:41.271
Don't move.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.273
What's your
name, kid?

33:45.234 --> 33:46.401
Spider...

33:47.152 --> 33:48.028
Socorro.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.205
Miles?

34:01.917 --> 34:03.418
Nobody calls me that.

34:06.255 --> 34:07.673
Well,
I'll be damned...

34:09.216 --> 34:11.760
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

34:13.011 --> 34:15.054
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.063
What are we
doin', boss?

34:26.525 --> 34:28.277
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.491
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.159
We are standing by
for extract, over.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.036
Take us in.

34:39.204 --> 34:40.038
Dragonfly
comin' left...

34:40.163 --> 34:41.581
we are go for extract.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.083
Be advised...

34:43.250 --> 34:44.626
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

34:44.793 --> 34:45.793
Let us go!

34:45.878 --> 34:46.503
Shut up.

34:46.587 --> 34:47.713
Sit tight, Blue One...

34:47.838 --> 34:48.672
we're inbound
to your pos.

34:49.297 --> 34:50.632
That's bingo in ten.

34:50.799 --> 34:51.842
We're on the clock.

34:54.511 --> 34:55.971
-Sit!
-Come on, in the dirt!

34:56.138 --> 34:57.222
-Feet up!
-Get down on the ground!

34:57.347 --> 34:57.973
Lyle...

34:58.056 --> 34:59.224
get me some
audio on this.

35:00.517 --> 35:01.476
Shut your mouth.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.227
Don't look up!

35:03.353 --> 35:04.104
That's
Sully's woman.

35:05.772 --> 35:06.899
She's an animal.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.067
Give it up, Quaritch.

35:10.319 --> 35:11.320
Sully.

35:11.486 --> 35:12.905
-It's all over.
-Son of a bitch.

35:14.198 --> 35:15.949
Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.

35:17.492 --> 35:18.827
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

35:36.136 --> 35:37.346
No, no, you stay
with the ikran.

35:37.513 --> 35:38.597
But, Dad...

35:38.722 --> 35:39.431
I'm a warrior
like you.

35:39.556 --> 35:40.182
I'm supposed
to fight.

35:40.307 --> 35:41.099
Neteyam.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.018
I'm not gonna
say it again.

35:44.728 --> 35:45.729
Yes, sir.

36:08.544 --> 36:09.962
Yeah, there's
nothin' after that.

36:24.268 --> 36:25.686
You want us to recover these remains?

36:52.087 --> 36:53.839
Blue One, stand by ready.

36:54.006 --> 36:54.923
We are three
minutes out.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.884
Heads up,
three minutes.

37:12.482 --> 37:13.483
Watch our six.

38:02.783 --> 38:03.617
Shut up!

38:18.715 --> 38:19.424
Shut up!

38:21.343 --> 38:22.511
Contact rear!

38:22.845 --> 38:23.679
Contact rear!

38:27.182 --> 38:28.183
Lo'ak!

38:29.393 --> 38:30.018
Shit.

38:33.397 --> 38:34.022
You little shit.

38:34.106 --> 38:34.731
Lo'ak!

38:34.815 --> 38:36.233
-Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
-Get back here!

38:36.400 --> 38:37.401
Run!

38:37.985 --> 38:38.819
Grab 'em!

38:45.784 --> 38:46.785
Come on!

38:47.828 --> 38:48.829
Cover!

38:52.666 --> 38:53.667
Come on!

39:08.849 --> 39:10.475
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

39:11.143 --> 39:13.145
I recognize your calling card.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.741
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

39:27.451 --> 39:28.660
You and I,
we got some...

39:29.203 --> 39:30.829
unfinished business.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.376
Demon!

39:36.877 --> 39:39.505
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

39:40.631 --> 39:43.342
I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...

39:43.550 --> 39:45.093
busy, haven't you?

39:45.260 --> 39:47.179
Dropped yourself a whole litter of...

39:48.013 --> 39:49.056
half-breeds.

39:57.981 --> 39:58.690
Na'vi!

40:01.985 --> 40:02.986
Go, go, go!

40:05.447 --> 40:06.323
You okay?
You okay, boy?

40:06.406 --> 40:07.074
Yeah.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.117
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

40:09.243 --> 40:09.910
Yes, sir!

40:12.246 --> 40:13.247
Move!

40:17.876 --> 40:18.877
Come on!

40:27.594 --> 40:28.595
Go, go, go!

40:29.471 --> 40:30.722
Flank out. Get after 'em!

40:37.980 --> 40:38.981
Spider?

40:42.317 --> 40:43.402
Spider!

40:43.569 --> 40:44.319
Kiri!

40:44.444 --> 40:45.070
Spider.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.281
Come! Come on.

40:47.948 --> 40:49.616
Spider. He's
down there.

40:49.741 --> 40:50.367
No.

40:55.539 --> 40:56.748
Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

40:56.915 --> 40:58.375
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

40:59.501 --> 41:01.003
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

41:08.635 --> 41:09.261
Blue One...

41:09.386 --> 41:10.012
fall back.

41:10.387 --> 41:11.388
Fall back!

41:11.555 --> 41:12.764
Fall back, fall back!

41:13.056 --> 41:14.057
Move out! Move!

41:14.933 --> 41:15.893
Move, move, move!

41:16.894 --> 41:17.769
-Kiri!
-Spider!

41:17.895 --> 41:19.062
Come, come.

41:19.188 --> 41:19.813
No.

41:19.897 --> 41:20.522
Come!

41:20.606 --> 41:21.690
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.986
Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

41:26.153 --> 41:27.112
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

41:27.279 --> 41:28.447
-Tuk, you hurt?
-Daddy!

41:48.634 --> 41:49.718
Okay,
we're clear.

41:49.885 --> 41:50.928
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

41:51.011 --> 41:52.387
-Mom!
-Tuk.

41:55.516 --> 41:57.809
It's okay. It's
okay. We're okay.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.978
Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

42:00.896 --> 42:01.855
Thank you.

42:02.481 --> 42:03.482
Where's Spider?

42:04.816 --> 42:05.817
They took him.

42:06.902 --> 42:07.903
They took him.

42:09.112 --> 42:10.447
Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

42:10.572 --> 42:11.615
All right? He's
a tough kid.

42:12.491 --> 42:13.534
All right.

42:15.577 --> 42:16.578
He's gonna be okay.

42:18.413 --> 42:19.706
We're all gonna be okay.

42:29.716 --> 42:30.634
Goddamn!

42:30.759 --> 42:31.426
Come on!

42:36.098 --> 42:37.474
Let me out
of here!

42:45.899 --> 42:47.025
He's completely feral.

42:47.943 --> 42:48.986
Thinks he's
one of them.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.575
This thing.
This Quaritch.

42:54.741 --> 42:55.784
Whatever
he is...

42:55.951 --> 42:56.994
-What's going on?
-He can walk right in here.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.704
He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.

42:58.871 --> 43:00.873
-This is our family. This is our home.
-This is about our family.

43:01.039 --> 43:02.374
This is about
our little ones.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.752
I cannot. You cannot ask this.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.673
I cannot leave
my People.

43:10.924 --> 43:11.675
I will not.

43:12.217 --> 43:13.302
He's hunting us.

43:15.179 --> 43:16.305
He's targeting
our family.

43:16.430 --> 43:17.723
You cannot
ask this!

43:18.223 --> 43:21.018
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

43:21.476 --> 43:22.603
This is
our home!

43:22.769 --> 43:23.937
He had
our children.

43:24.104 --> 43:25.731
He had 'em
under his knife!

43:33.155 --> 43:34.740
My father gave me...

43:34.865 --> 43:37.075
this bow
as he lay dying.

43:37.242 --> 43:39.328
And he said
protect the People.

43:40.621 --> 43:42.247
You're
Toruk Makto!

43:43.457 --> 43:45.083
This will protect the People!

43:45.542 --> 43:46.793
Quaritch
has Spider.

43:46.919 --> 43:48.128
And that kid
knows everything.

43:48.295 --> 43:49.588
He knows our
whole operation...

43:49.713 --> 43:51.048
and he can lead
them right in here.

43:51.757 --> 43:54.259
If the People harbor
us, they will die.

43:55.844 --> 43:57.012
Do you
understand?

44:01.683 --> 44:02.809
Look, I
got nothing.

44:03.727 --> 44:04.895
I got
no plan...

44:07.147 --> 44:08.857
But I can protect this family.

44:08.982 --> 44:10.692
That I can do.

44:24.081 --> 44:25.666
I know
one thing.

44:28.627 --> 44:29.837
Wherever we go...

44:29.962 --> 44:31.755
this family is our fortress.

44:45.644 --> 44:47.104
Where is Jake Sully?

44:47.271 --> 44:48.397
I don't know!

44:50.232 --> 44:51.441
We know that
you know.

44:52.276 --> 44:53.610
I don't know!

44:53.777 --> 44:54.653
Just form a picture...

44:54.778 --> 44:55.445
in your mind.

44:55.821 --> 44:57.322
Is it one of the
floating mountains?

44:58.240 --> 44:59.408
Let me
out of here!

44:59.575 --> 45:01.034
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

45:01.201 --> 45:01.910
I don't know!

45:02.369 --> 45:04.538
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

45:05.664 --> 45:06.999
I don't know!

45:07.708 --> 45:09.835
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.

45:10.752 --> 45:12.421
Which clans would be harboring him?

45:12.504 --> 45:13.130
I don't know!

45:13.213 --> 45:14.464
You're gonna
have to kill me!

45:16.508 --> 45:17.134
Watch this.

45:17.259 --> 45:18.844
You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

45:18.969 --> 45:20.053
It's not gonna stop...

45:20.179 --> 45:21.221
until you give
us something.

45:21.430 --> 45:22.723
Where is he?

45:23.348 --> 45:25.309
I don't know,
you buttholes! Okay?

45:25.475 --> 45:26.727
I don't know!

45:40.032 --> 45:42.492
General, let me try
the personal angle.

45:47.039 --> 45:48.332
He's not your son.

46:19.947 --> 46:21.031
Easy, tiger.

46:21.198 --> 46:22.074
Easy.

46:30.958 --> 46:31.959
We good?

46:38.590 --> 46:39.716
Kid, you
got heart.

46:40.801 --> 46:43.178
Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

46:44.388 --> 46:45.889
But you gave
them nothin'.

46:48.058 --> 46:49.142
I respect that.

46:55.107 --> 46:56.692
I thought you
might want this.

47:05.117 --> 47:06.660
That's Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

47:07.452 --> 47:08.453
Deceased.

47:09.121 --> 47:10.289
Killed
in action.

47:16.003 --> 47:17.379
I'm not
that man.

47:18.797 --> 47:22.509
But I do have
his memories...

47:25.637 --> 47:27.055
enough to
know that...

47:28.682 --> 47:29.933
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

47:31.810 --> 47:33.520
But that's
not an apology.

47:34.771 --> 47:37.065
I'm not your father.
Technically...

47:37.232 --> 47:39.776
you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

47:40.235 --> 47:41.236
But...

47:42.279 --> 47:43.530
I can
help you.

47:44.531 --> 47:46.033
I can get you
outta here.

47:50.037 --> 47:52.289
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

47:52.456 --> 47:54.499
I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

47:56.084 --> 47:57.419
and I
admire loyalty.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.215
Just ride along.

48:04.009 --> 48:06.720
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

48:15.938 --> 48:17.731
This is like stones
in my heart.

48:19.608 --> 48:22.277
Tarsem is wise
for his years.

48:22.444 --> 48:24.196
He will be
a strong Olo'eyktan.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.033
The leader must die.

48:32.329 --> 48:34.164
So the leader
can be born.

48:37.125 --> 48:39.378
Toruk Makto
will disappear.

48:41.839 --> 48:43.423
The People
will be safe.

49:10.075 --> 49:11.952
A father protects.

49:13.203 --> 49:14.913
It's what gives
him meaning.

49:19.168 --> 49:20.669
One life ends.

49:21.795 --> 49:23.172
Another begins.

49:37.269 --> 49:38.270
Tuk.

49:42.399 --> 49:44.193
The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.

49:45.402 --> 49:46.945
Thousands of islands.

49:47.946 --> 49:51.700
An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.

49:52.451 --> 49:54.161
Are we there yet?

51:00.018 --> 51:00.936
Hey...

51:01.061 --> 51:01.687
leave it.

51:03.564 --> 51:04.565
On me.

51:06.733 --> 51:07.734
Tuk.

51:09.236 --> 51:10.237
Be nice.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.031
Be nice.

51:13.782 --> 51:14.783
Hey.

51:33.385 --> 51:34.678
Easy.
Just be cool.

51:35.429 --> 51:36.555
Look.
What is that?

51:37.389 --> 51:38.640
Is that supposed
to be a tail?

51:56.241 --> 51:57.284
It's too small.

51:57.451 --> 51:58.452
How are they
supposed to swim?

51:58.619 --> 52:00.996
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

52:03.707 --> 52:04.708
Hey.

52:29.608 --> 52:32.194
Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina...

52:32.736 --> 52:33.737
the Reef People.

52:34.655 --> 52:35.948
I See you,
Tonowari.

52:37.032 --> 52:38.200
Jakesully.

52:38.367 --> 52:39.701
I knew him as
a tough leader.

52:44.540 --> 52:46.375
But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.

52:50.754 --> 52:52.339
I See you, Ronal.

52:52.506 --> 52:53.799
Tsahik of
the Metkayina.

52:53.966 --> 52:55.133
I See you,
Ronal.

52:57.386 --> 52:59.388
Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

53:00.681 --> 53:01.765
We seek uturu.

53:04.059 --> 53:05.561
Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

53:08.689 --> 53:10.399
We are
Reef People.

53:10.566 --> 53:11.275
You are
Forest People.

53:11.817 --> 53:13.277
Your skills will
mean nothing here.

53:14.069 --> 53:16.321
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

53:16.488 --> 53:17.489
Yes.

53:20.868 --> 53:22.202
Their arms
are thin.

53:23.203 --> 53:24.037
Mom.

53:24.162 --> 53:24.955
Their tails...

53:25.289 --> 53:26.623
are weak.

53:26.790 --> 53:28.375
You will be
slow in the water.

53:31.628 --> 53:32.921
These children...

53:33.088 --> 53:34.923
-are not even true Na'vi.
-Dad.

53:36.884 --> 53:38.093
Yes, we are!

53:41.638 --> 53:43.056
They have
demon blood!

53:48.061 --> 53:49.354
Look. Look.

53:51.356 --> 53:53.400
Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am Na'vi.

53:53.567 --> 53:54.860
All right?
You can adapt.

53:55.485 --> 53:56.695
We will adapt.

53:56.945 --> 53:57.654
Okay?

53:58.947 --> 54:01.033
My husband
was Toruk Makto.

54:02.910 --> 54:03.869
He led the clans to...

54:03.994 --> 54:06.997
victory against the Sky People.

54:10.751 --> 54:11.960
This you
call victory?

54:13.128 --> 54:14.796
Hiding among
strangers?

54:19.092 --> 54:21.887
It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

54:22.012 --> 54:22.846
Chosen One.

54:28.936 --> 54:30.729
I apologize for
my mate. She's...

54:30.896 --> 54:32.314
Do not
apologize for me.

54:32.439 --> 54:33.690
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

54:33.774 --> 54:34.608
Jake.

54:39.780 --> 54:42.366
Toruk Makto is a
great war leader.

54:43.200 --> 54:45.869
All Na'vi people know his story.

54:46.036 --> 54:47.412
But we Metkayina...

54:47.579 --> 54:48.997
-Dad.
-...are not at war.

54:51.875 --> 54:54.628
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

54:54.795 --> 54:56.672
I'm done
with war.

54:56.839 --> 54:57.840
Okay?

54:58.423 --> 55:00.342
I just want to keep
my family safe.

55:04.847 --> 55:06.849
Uturu has
been asked.

55:11.770 --> 55:12.896
Do we have to go?

55:13.689 --> 55:14.690
We'll be okay.

55:27.411 --> 55:29.913
Toruk Makto and his
family will stay with us.

55:31.123 --> 55:33.458
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

55:34.918 --> 55:36.753
Now, they do not
know the sea.

55:37.629 --> 55:39.381
So they will be
like babies...

55:40.174 --> 55:41.049
taking their...

55:41.175 --> 55:42.176
first breath.

55:42.843 --> 55:47.055
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

55:47.181 --> 55:48.515
useless.

55:50.684 --> 55:51.435
Okay, what
do we say?

55:51.560 --> 55:52.644
Thank you.

55:52.769 --> 55:53.687
Thank you.

55:54.021 --> 55:55.022
Thank you.

55:55.564 --> 55:59.234
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

55:59.610 --> 56:01.236
-Father, why do...
-It is decided.

56:02.112 --> 56:04.781
Come. I will show
you our village.

56:15.334 --> 56:16.335
This way.

56:19.671 --> 56:21.215
Tuk, let's go.

56:21.715 --> 56:22.758
Just up here.

56:31.391 --> 56:32.643
This is for you.

56:33.393 --> 56:34.394
Your new home.

56:35.771 --> 56:36.772
Yeah, this will work.

56:37.773 --> 56:38.857
This is great.

56:39.024 --> 56:40.025
It's nice, right?

56:53.580 --> 56:54.706
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

56:54.873 --> 56:55.666
Remember?

56:55.791 --> 56:56.625
Family
meeting.

56:56.792 --> 56:57.793
Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.

56:57.960 --> 56:58.836
Kiri.

56:59.253 --> 57:00.254
What?

57:00.420 --> 57:02.005
Okay.

57:02.172 --> 57:03.841
I need
you kids

57:03.966 --> 57:05.634
on your best
behavior.

57:05.801 --> 57:07.302
I mean it.

57:07.469 --> 57:08.929
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

57:09.972 --> 57:12.266
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

57:12.432 --> 57:13.684
Yes, sir.

57:16.144 --> 57:17.896
I want to
go home.

57:19.857 --> 57:21.483
Oh, Tuk.

57:22.109 --> 57:25.487
Tuk, this is
our home now.

57:26.864 --> 57:30.284
Now we're gonna
get through this.

57:30.450 --> 57:31.410
We're gonna
get through this

57:31.535 --> 57:33.370
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

57:33.537 --> 57:35.539
What does your
father always say?

57:36.164 --> 57:38.584
Sullys stick
together.

57:38.750 --> 57:40.961
That's right.
Sullys stick together.

57:41.128 --> 57:42.754
Now this time
with some feeling.

57:42.921 --> 57:44.256
Yeah.

57:44.423 --> 57:45.215
Sullys stick
together.

57:45.382 --> 57:46.675
Sullys stick
together.

57:47.217 --> 57:48.594
Sullys stick
together.

57:59.188 --> 58:00.189
Come on.

1:00:32.299 --> 1:00:33.675
Are you all right?

1:00:33.842 --> 1:00:34.510
You're too fast!

1:00:34.635 --> 1:00:36.178
Wait for us.

1:00:37.095 --> 1:00:38.180
Just breathe.

1:00:38.305 --> 1:00:39.264
Breathe.

1:00:39.431 --> 1:00:40.557
You are not
good divers.

1:00:41.266 --> 1:00:43.519
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

1:00:44.102 --> 1:00:45.103
Come on, bro.

1:00:45.270 --> 1:00:47.272
We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

1:00:47.397 --> 1:00:48.398
We don't know
what you're saying.

1:00:48.857 --> 1:00:49.858
I will teach you.

1:00:50.025 --> 1:00:51.360
-Where is Kiri?
-Kiri?

1:00:51.527 --> 1:00:52.528
-Who?
-Kiri.

1:00:52.694 --> 1:00:53.695
Where is Kiri?

1:00:53.862 --> 1:00:55.113
Did you see her?

1:01:05.707 --> 1:01:07.209
Get on the ship...

1:01:07.376 --> 1:01:08.877
find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

1:01:10.546 --> 1:01:11.421
Let's go!

1:01:12.256 --> 1:01:13.215
Chop-chop.

1:01:13.340 --> 1:01:14.174
Sweet.

1:01:14.675 --> 1:01:16.802
Whoa, hold on
there, hotshot!

1:01:18.011 --> 1:01:19.012
You listen up.

1:01:20.264 --> 1:01:22.474
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

1:01:22.641 --> 1:01:24.643
We hit the ground,
and you take off...

1:01:24.810 --> 1:01:26.979
I'll have you back
in two minutes...

1:01:27.145 --> 1:01:29.731
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

1:01:29.898 --> 1:01:30.899
Understood?

1:01:32.025 --> 1:01:33.151
Understood?

1:01:33.652 --> 1:01:34.820
Yes, sir.

1:01:35.195 --> 1:01:36.196
We up?

1:01:36.363 --> 1:01:37.364
Team's up.

1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:53.046
All right,
listen up.

1:01:54.423 --> 1:01:56.633
Jake Sully's
gone to ground.

1:01:57.134 --> 1:01:58.135
Don't
matter.

1:01:58.302 --> 1:01:59.678
Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

1:01:59.845 --> 1:02:02.598
and his batshit
crazy wife, too.

1:02:04.224 --> 1:02:05.475
To do so...

1:02:05.601 --> 1:02:07.853
we go Na'vi.

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:09.354
Full tilt,
all the way.

1:02:09.521 --> 1:02:10.147
That means we...

1:02:10.230 --> 1:02:13.775
eat Na'vi.
We ride Na'vi.

1:02:13.942 --> 1:02:15.777
Think Na'vi.

1:02:31.418 --> 1:02:32.628
All right, smart guy.

1:02:33.545 --> 1:02:35.964
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

1:02:36.089 --> 1:02:37.716
to official
interpreter.

1:02:44.973 --> 1:02:46.475
These are ilu.

1:02:46.934 --> 1:02:48.519
If you want
to live here...

1:02:48.685 --> 1:02:49.937
you have to ride.

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:52.272
Make the
bond gently.

1:02:57.778 --> 1:02:59.488
Feel his breath.

1:02:59.655 --> 1:03:01.114
Feel his strength.

1:03:03.325 --> 1:03:04.326
Hold here.

1:03:06.912 --> 1:03:08.038
Hold on.

1:03:27.641 --> 1:03:28.433
You all right...

1:03:28.559 --> 1:03:29.601
Forest Boy?

1:03:39.611 --> 1:03:41.154
This is a
warrior's mount.

1:03:41.321 --> 1:03:42.656
Not easy
to master.

1:03:42.823 --> 1:03:45.325
Perhaps
you should...

1:03:45.492 --> 1:03:46.535
start with
an ilu.

1:03:47.077 --> 1:03:48.161
Nah.
This one.

1:03:51.456 --> 1:03:52.749
Now remember...

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:55.544
when you dive back
in, good position.

1:03:55.711 --> 1:03:56.712
Very important.

1:04:00.340 --> 1:04:01.341
I got this.

1:04:28.076 --> 1:04:29.286
That's it, okay.

1:04:30.495 --> 1:04:31.496
Steady.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:47.262
Ah, shit.

1:05:18.001 --> 1:05:19.753
I love her
already.

1:05:59.918 --> 1:06:00.961
Breathe in.

1:06:04.214 --> 1:06:05.799
And breathe out.

1:06:06.925 --> 1:06:09.052
Imagine flickering
a flame.

1:06:11.138 --> 1:06:14.141
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

1:06:15.684 --> 1:06:16.685
Breathe in.

1:06:17.978 --> 1:06:20.147
Breathe from
down here.

1:06:21.648 --> 1:06:23.609
Breathe out slowly.

1:06:25.777 --> 1:06:28.322
Lo'ak, your
heartbeat is fast.

1:06:28.488 --> 1:06:30.115
-Sorry.
-Try to focus.

1:06:30.282 --> 1:06:31.742
-Okay.
-Breathe in.

1:06:33.827 --> 1:06:35.495
And breathe out.

1:06:35.662 --> 1:06:37.206
Let your mind go clear.

1:06:56.016 --> 1:06:58.143
You are learning
to breathe.

1:07:03.732 --> 1:07:05.609
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

1:07:20.165 --> 1:07:21.166
I got this.

1:07:28.048 --> 1:07:29.091
What?

1:07:29.258 --> 1:07:32.052
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

1:07:34.304 --> 1:07:36.306
Jake Sully did it
the hard way?

1:07:37.015 --> 1:07:38.225
What do
you think?

1:07:41.770 --> 1:07:42.855
What are we
doin', Colonel?

1:07:47.901 --> 1:07:48.944
This is gonna
be good.

1:07:52.322 --> 1:07:53.532
All right, move up.

1:08:00.998 --> 1:08:02.499
It's you and me, cupcake.

1:08:16.054 --> 1:08:18.223
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

1:08:19.349 --> 1:08:20.600
Thanks a lot, kid!

1:08:25.564 --> 1:08:26.189
Move up,
move up!

1:08:34.698 --> 1:08:35.698
You see 'em?

1:08:58.013 --> 1:08:59.723
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

1:08:59.848 --> 1:09:00.474
Come on.

1:09:03.685 --> 1:09:05.062
Let's go.
We're outta here.

1:09:11.151 --> 1:09:12.152
Yeah!

1:09:12.611 --> 1:09:13.737
That's right!

1:09:16.323 --> 1:09:17.908
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

1:09:18.075 --> 1:09:19.033
Yeah, Colonel!

1:09:19.201 --> 1:09:20.452
Who's up next?

1:09:29.169 --> 1:09:32.756
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

1:09:37.426 --> 1:09:39.470
The sea is around you...

1:09:40.055 --> 1:09:40.764
and in you.

1:09:47.354 --> 1:09:49.857
The sea is your home...

1:09:50.482 --> 1:09:52.276
before your birth...

1:09:53.234 --> 1:09:55.070
and after your death.

1:10:00.784 --> 1:10:04.371
Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.

1:10:06.832 --> 1:10:11.170
Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.

1:10:12.504 --> 1:10:14.339
The sea gives...

1:10:15.716 --> 1:10:17.509
and the sea takes.

1:10:20.512 --> 1:10:23.432
Water connects all things.

1:10:25.601 --> 1:10:27.436
Life to death.

1:10:29.605 --> 1:10:30.606
Darkness...

1:10:32.274 --> 1:10:33.066
to light.

1:10:35.235 --> 1:10:35.861
I got it!

1:10:37.112 --> 1:10:37.821
You did it!

1:11:41.218 --> 1:11:42.219
What is
she doing?

1:11:42.970 --> 1:11:43.971
I don't know.

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:45.722
She's just looking
at the sand.

1:11:48.433 --> 1:11:49.601
What'd you say?

1:11:49.977 --> 1:11:52.604
Are you some
kind of... freak?

1:11:53.438 --> 1:11:54.898
He asked if
you are a freak.

1:11:58.277 --> 1:11:58.902
No.

1:11:59.695 --> 1:12:00.821
Are you sure?

1:12:00.988 --> 1:12:02.531
I mean, you're
not even real Na'vi.

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:04.575
Look at
these hands.

1:12:04.867 --> 1:12:05.993
I mean,
look at them...

1:12:06.827 --> 1:12:07.828
Hey!

1:12:08.328 --> 1:12:09.705
Back off,
fishlips!

1:12:09.872 --> 1:12:12.124
Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:13.458
Look at his
little baby tail!

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:14.626
Don't
touch me!

1:12:14.751 --> 1:12:15.377
Baby tail!

1:12:15.502 --> 1:12:16.712
Leave us alone!

1:12:17.129 --> 1:12:18.005
He's not normal.

1:12:18.338 --> 1:12:19.173
Look at his tail.

1:12:19.298 --> 1:12:20.048
Aw, baby tail!

1:12:20.299 --> 1:12:21.466
It is so cute!

1:12:22.885 --> 1:12:24.011
You heard
what she said.

1:12:24.970 --> 1:12:26.180
Leave
them alone.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:27.806
Ah, big
brother come...

1:12:29.057 --> 1:12:30.392
Back off.

1:12:31.518 --> 1:12:32.686
Now.

1:12:38.525 --> 1:12:39.902
Smart choice.

1:12:40.319 --> 1:12:41.737
And from
now on...

1:12:41.904 --> 1:12:43.906
I need you to
respect my sister.

1:12:48.285 --> 1:12:48.911
Let's go.

1:12:52.164 --> 1:12:53.582
Buh-bye!

1:12:53.916 --> 1:12:54.917
Look at them.

1:12:55.083 --> 1:12:56.084
They're all freaks.

1:12:56.251 --> 1:12:57.252
The whole family.

1:12:59.546 --> 1:13:00.547
Lo'ak.

1:13:00.714 --> 1:13:01.715
I got this,
bro.

1:13:05.385 --> 1:13:06.803
I know this
hand is funny.

1:13:06.970 --> 1:13:09.556
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

1:13:10.933 --> 1:13:12.726
But it can do
something really cool.

1:13:12.893 --> 1:13:13.894
Watch.

1:13:14.061 --> 1:13:16.396
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

1:13:16.563 --> 1:13:17.689
Okay? Then...

1:13:21.902 --> 1:13:22.945
It's called a
punch, bitch!

1:13:23.111 --> 1:13:24.446
Don't ever touch
my sister again.

1:13:26.031 --> 1:13:27.658
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:30.661
Come here!

1:13:31.870 --> 1:13:32.871
Hey!

1:13:37.334 --> 1:13:38.669
Stop this!

1:13:39.586 --> 1:13:40.587
Stop it!

1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:43.966
So stupid!

1:13:47.344 --> 1:13:48.345
Ow, my tail!

1:13:50.305 --> 1:13:52.391
My ear!
Let go!

1:13:52.724 --> 1:13:54.893
He's got my ear!

1:13:59.773 --> 1:14:01.608
What was the
one thing I asked?

1:14:01.733 --> 1:14:02.359
The one thing!

1:14:02.484 --> 1:14:03.694
-Stay out of trouble.

1:14:03.861 --> 1:14:04.862
-Right.
-It was my fault.

1:14:05.028 --> 1:14:05.696
I don't think so.

1:14:05.821 --> 1:14:07.406
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

1:14:07.573 --> 1:14:09.324
Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

1:14:10.033 --> 1:14:11.034
He called
her a freak.

1:14:15.122 --> 1:14:16.331
Go apologize
to Aonung.

1:14:16.874 --> 1:14:17.791
What?

1:14:17.958 --> 1:14:19.877
He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

1:14:20.836 --> 1:14:22.546
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

1:14:23.005 --> 1:14:24.006
Just go.

1:14:29.178 --> 1:14:30.179
Hey.

1:14:32.139 --> 1:14:33.473
So what'd the
other guys look like?

1:14:34.308 --> 1:14:35.350
Worse.

1:14:36.018 --> 1:14:37.019
That's good.

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:38.604
A lot worse.

1:14:38.896 --> 1:14:40.105
Get outta here.

1:14:51.700 --> 1:14:52.784
What is wrong?

1:14:54.786 --> 1:14:56.580
Nothing. I'm fine.

1:14:57.748 --> 1:14:59.583
Why should I not be fine?

1:15:06.965 --> 1:15:09.259
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

1:15:11.470 --> 1:15:12.638
Oh, Kiri.

1:15:16.183 --> 1:15:18.560
Ah, what's tree
boy doing here?

1:15:21.855 --> 1:15:22.940
I'm sorry
I hit you.

1:15:23.815 --> 1:15:24.983
So many times.

1:15:31.490 --> 1:15:32.991
We should
be friends.

1:15:35.619 --> 1:15:36.620
Come hunting with us.

1:15:37.329 --> 1:15:38.455
Outside
the reef.

1:15:39.289 --> 1:15:40.791
It's where
the men hunt.

1:15:41.875 --> 1:15:42.960
No way.
I'm not allowed.

1:15:44.127 --> 1:15:45.963
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

1:15:47.130 --> 1:15:47.881
Let's do it.

1:16:03.063 --> 1:16:04.648
Come on! Come on!

1:16:05.607 --> 1:16:06.608
Yeah!

1:16:14.533 --> 1:16:15.993
Keep up, Forest Boy!

1:16:17.536 --> 1:16:18.370
Yeah!

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:32.801
Hey, you lived!

1:16:33.385 --> 1:16:34.887
That was
insane, cuz!

1:16:36.054 --> 1:16:37.055
This way.

1:16:37.181 --> 1:16:38.140
I know a
good spot.

1:17:30.526 --> 1:17:31.527
Hey, guys!

1:17:32.277 --> 1:17:33.278
Hey!

1:17:35.864 --> 1:17:36.865
Aonung!

1:17:38.408 --> 1:17:39.785
Come on, this isn't funny!

1:17:51.964 --> 1:17:52.965
Hey,
Aonung!

1:21:27.888 --> 1:21:28.805
Holy shit.

1:21:58.210 --> 1:21:59.211
You're a tulkun.

1:22:02.965 --> 1:22:04.007
You saved my life.

1:22:04.675 --> 1:22:05.676
Thank you.

1:22:07.094 --> 1:22:08.095
Thank you.

1:22:14.935 --> 1:22:16.937
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

1:22:23.944 --> 1:22:25.529
They hurt you, didn't they?

1:22:27.906 --> 1:22:29.157
I'll try to
pull it out.

1:22:30.701 --> 1:22:31.827
Just trust me, okay?

1:23:06.904 --> 1:23:07.905
Friends?

1:23:11.533 --> 1:23:13.785
That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

1:23:18.624 --> 1:23:19.291
Bro!

1:25:11.403 --> 1:25:13.030
So, what is it,
baby girl?

1:25:14.364 --> 1:25:15.490
You missin'
Spider?

1:25:18.911 --> 1:25:19.912
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:25:21.038 --> 1:25:22.289
But that's
not it.

1:25:24.833 --> 1:25:25.792
Okay...

1:25:27.669 --> 1:25:28.670
So what is it?

1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:31.215
I feel her, Dad.

1:25:33.884 --> 1:25:34.885
You feel who?

1:25:35.636 --> 1:25:36.637
Eywa.

1:25:41.350 --> 1:25:42.851
I hear her breathing.

1:25:44.228 --> 1:25:45.729
I hear her heartbeat.

1:25:47.189 --> 1:25:48.565
She's so close.

1:25:49.816 --> 1:25:52.027
She's just there...

1:25:53.987 --> 1:25:55.781
like a word about
to be spoken.

1:26:01.745 --> 1:26:03.580
I know you think I'm crazy.

1:26:06.375 --> 1:26:08.335
You're not crazy,
baby girl.

1:26:12.756 --> 1:26:15.092
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

1:26:20.180 --> 1:26:21.473
Mighty.

1:26:29.189 --> 1:26:30.649
Tell him what
you told me!

1:26:36.446 --> 1:26:38.031
You like lookin' at the stars?

1:26:41.368 --> 1:26:43.120
You know, my dad
came from a star.

1:26:44.663 --> 1:26:45.622
That one.

1:26:45.747 --> 1:26:46.373
Right there.

1:26:49.918 --> 1:26:50.919
Lo'ak!

1:26:51.295 --> 1:26:52.671
Oh, man.
I'm in trouble.

1:26:55.591 --> 1:26:56.300
Go.

1:26:56.425 --> 1:26:57.426
I will see
you again.

1:27:16.111 --> 1:27:18.155
-The boy has returned!
-It is the Sully boy.

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:19.823
-They found the boy.
-They found him.

1:27:25.495 --> 1:27:26.496
Hey, hey.

1:27:28.832 --> 1:27:29.958
Let's have a
look at you. Okay.

1:27:31.543 --> 1:27:32.836
He's fine.
He's fine...

1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:33.545
yeah.

1:27:33.629 --> 1:27:34.922
Just a few scratches.

1:27:37.966 --> 1:27:39.468
I pray for the strength
that I will not...

1:27:39.593 --> 1:27:41.512
pluck the eyeballs out
of my youngest son!

1:27:43.180 --> 1:27:44.181
No.

1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:47.226
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

1:27:49.686 --> 1:27:51.396
The blame is his.

1:27:52.689 --> 1:27:54.107
Okay,
let's go.

1:27:54.608 --> 1:27:55.609
No.

1:27:56.068 --> 1:27:57.277
This is not
Aonung's fault.

1:27:58.028 --> 1:27:59.279
This was my idea.

1:27:59.446 --> 1:28:00.948
Aonung tried to
talk me out of it.

1:28:01.907 --> 1:28:02.908
Really.

1:28:03.575 --> 1:28:04.201
Come on.

1:28:05.827 --> 1:28:06.870
I'm sorry.

1:28:07.621 --> 1:28:08.247
Come on.

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:12.584
I got this.

1:28:15.838 --> 1:28:17.381
Is this true?

1:28:17.506 --> 1:28:19.550
Aonung. What
were you thinking?

1:28:22.803 --> 1:28:24.763
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

1:28:24.930 --> 1:28:26.765
-That's all I was trying to...
-I don't want to hear it.

1:28:26.932 --> 1:28:27.933
Dad...

1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:29.601
You brought shame
to this family.

1:28:32.896 --> 1:28:34.022
Can I go now?

1:28:34.565 --> 1:28:36.191
Any more trouble, I
jerk a knot in your tail.

1:28:36.316 --> 1:28:37.442
You read me?

1:28:37.985 --> 1:28:39.903
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

1:28:50.622 --> 1:28:51.832
Where
were you?

1:28:51.999 --> 1:28:52.958
Yeah.

1:28:53.083 --> 1:28:54.960
What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

1:28:55.627 --> 1:28:56.628
Sorry, sir.

1:29:01.258 --> 1:29:02.843
Why did you
speak for me?

1:29:03.552 --> 1:29:04.803
Because I know
what it's like...

1:29:04.970 --> 1:29:06.305
to be one big
disappointment.

1:29:09.933 --> 1:29:11.810
I wish I'd
been there.

1:29:11.977 --> 1:29:13.896
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

1:29:14.563 --> 1:29:16.899
The tulkun have not returned yet.

1:29:17.065 --> 1:29:19.026
And anyway, no tulkun is ever alone.

1:29:19.818 --> 1:29:20.903
Well, this one was.

1:29:21.820 --> 1:29:23.655
He had a
missing fin.

1:29:23.822 --> 1:29:24.740
Like a
stump.

1:29:24.865 --> 1:29:25.490
On the
left side.

1:29:25.574 --> 1:29:26.700
Poor tulkun.

1:29:27.409 --> 1:29:28.410
Payakan.

1:29:30.412 --> 1:29:31.288
Who's Payakan?

1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:33.749
A young bull
who went rogue.

1:29:33.916 --> 1:29:35.501
He's outcast.
Alone.

1:29:36.043 --> 1:29:37.169
And he has a missing fin.

1:29:37.419 --> 1:29:38.837
They say
he is a killer.

1:29:39.004 --> 1:29:40.881
-No, no.
-He killed Na'vi...

1:29:41.006 --> 1:29:42.925
and other
tulkun.

1:29:44.384 --> 1:29:45.260
Not here...

1:29:45.385 --> 1:29:46.178
but far to the south.

1:29:46.345 --> 1:29:47.054
No, he's no killer.

1:29:49.056 --> 1:29:50.557
You are lucky to be alive.

1:29:50.724 --> 1:29:52.059
I'm telling you guys.

1:29:52.184 --> 1:29:53.268
He saved my life.

1:29:53.977 --> 1:29:55.062
He's my
friend.

1:29:55.687 --> 1:29:56.855
My baby
bro!

1:29:57.022 --> 1:29:58.065
The Mighty Warrior...

1:29:58.649 --> 1:29:59.858
who faced the killer tulkun...

1:29:59.942 --> 1:30:00.776
and lived to tell about it, huh?

1:30:03.195 --> 1:30:04.279
You guys
aren't listening.

1:30:05.322 --> 1:30:08.283
-Lo'ak, I'm listening.
-Lo'ak, come back.

1:30:08.450 --> 1:30:09.743
You skxawngs.

1:30:10.869 --> 1:30:11.495
Payakan!

1:30:13.956 --> 1:30:14.623
Payakan!

1:30:17.417 --> 1:30:18.252
Payakan!

1:30:27.135 --> 1:30:28.053
It's good
to see you.

1:30:31.473 --> 1:30:33.100
Why are
you outcast?

1:30:33.267 --> 1:30:34.268
What happened?

1:30:39.982 --> 1:30:42.234
I trust you.

1:30:42.943 --> 1:30:45.070
You can trust me.

1:31:30.866 --> 1:31:32.075
Bro, that's
disgusting!

1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:14.910
We are here.

1:32:21.542 --> 1:32:23.669
This is the Cove
of the Ancestors.

1:32:23.836 --> 1:32:25.379
Our most
sacred place.

1:32:32.469 --> 1:32:35.430
Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

1:32:48.735 --> 1:32:49.736
This is it.

1:32:50.320 --> 1:32:51.655
This is the Spirit Tree.

1:33:58.555 --> 1:34:00.015
My beautiful
daughter.

1:34:01.517 --> 1:34:02.518
Hi, Ma.

1:34:03.477 --> 1:34:04.728
I'm so happy
to see you.

1:34:05.854 --> 1:34:06.855
But you
look troubled.

1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:14.321
My sweet girl.

1:34:15.197 --> 1:34:16.573
It will be okay.

1:34:24.122 --> 1:34:25.290
What is it, baby?

1:34:26.708 --> 1:34:28.043
Why am I
different?

1:34:30.712 --> 1:34:32.923
What does the Great
Mother want from me?

1:34:36.552 --> 1:34:38.512
Who was
my father?

1:34:42.641 --> 1:34:44.226
Oh, my darling.

1:34:48.981 --> 1:34:50.232
No!

1:35:08.458 --> 1:35:09.543
Come on.

1:35:15.549 --> 1:35:16.884
What is wrong?
What is it?

1:35:17.676 --> 1:35:18.760
It was a seizure.

1:35:19.386 --> 1:35:20.387
Is she breathing?

1:35:20.888 --> 1:35:22.014
Is she
breathing?

1:35:25.559 --> 1:35:26.727
Get her
to the village!

1:35:26.852 --> 1:35:27.477
Hurry!

1:35:27.603 --> 1:35:28.854
Let's go!
Let's move!

1:35:28.979 --> 1:35:29.646
Tuk, come.

1:35:44.828 --> 1:35:46.079
-Hi!
-It's good to see you.

1:35:46.246 --> 1:35:47.372
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

1:35:47.539 --> 1:35:48.582
Neteyam, keep
them back!

1:35:48.749 --> 1:35:49.541
How is she?

1:35:49.708 --> 1:35:50.834
She's still unconscious.

1:35:51.793 --> 1:35:52.961
There's no bleed.

1:35:53.086 --> 1:35:54.171
There's no fracture.

1:35:55.214 --> 1:35:56.798
No effects of hypoxia.

1:35:56.965 --> 1:35:58.091
The brain looks good.

1:36:02.763 --> 1:36:05.724
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

1:36:05.891 --> 1:36:07.684
-Okay.
-She's definitely had a seizure.

1:36:07.851 --> 1:36:10.103
-I think we can rule out toxins.
-So what is it?

1:36:11.355 --> 1:36:12.898
I see that I am
not needed here.

1:36:13.565 --> 1:36:14.983
You are Tsahik!

1:36:16.944 --> 1:36:18.237
Remove
these things.

1:36:19.071 --> 1:36:20.072
Out!

1:36:20.197 --> 1:36:20.906
You have
done nothing!

1:36:21.073 --> 1:36:22.574
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

1:36:23.367 --> 1:36:24.785
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

1:36:26.495 --> 1:36:27.496
Tuktirey.

1:36:36.004 --> 1:36:39.216
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

1:36:39.383 --> 1:36:40.509
-That's it.
-What?

1:36:40.676 --> 1:36:42.886
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

1:36:43.512 --> 1:36:44.513
-Epilepsy?
-Yep.

1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:46.723
You see visions.
You get...

1:36:46.890 --> 1:36:49.226
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

1:36:57.442 --> 1:37:00.863
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

1:37:01.029 --> 1:37:02.823
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

1:37:05.075 --> 1:37:06.118
What? Ever?

1:37:06.285 --> 1:37:07.286
Jake.

1:37:07.828 --> 1:37:09.663
If she seizes
underwater again...

1:37:10.414 --> 1:37:11.623
it could kill her.

1:37:24.011 --> 1:37:25.012
You're awake!

1:37:34.021 --> 1:37:35.522
Kiri, my sweet child.

1:37:36.356 --> 1:37:37.900
Oh, my sweet little girl.

1:37:38.650 --> 1:37:39.651
Okay, this one.

1:37:39.776 --> 1:37:40.652
"I See you."

1:37:47.075 --> 1:37:48.327
That's what I
just said, isn't it?

1:37:50.495 --> 1:37:52.956
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

1:37:54.082 --> 1:37:56.335
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

1:37:57.252 --> 1:37:58.253
Boss...

1:37:58.962 --> 1:38:00.839
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

1:38:01.006 --> 1:38:02.299
A rogue gunship.

1:38:03.300 --> 1:38:04.301
Where?

1:38:04.468 --> 1:38:06.053
Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.

1:38:09.014 --> 1:38:10.015
Hang on.

1:38:12.643 --> 1:38:16.772
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

1:38:17.397 --> 1:38:18.857
if you project the track...

1:38:20.192 --> 1:38:21.944
it hits this island group.

1:38:23.111 --> 1:38:24.988
That's hundreds
of islands.

1:38:25.155 --> 1:38:27.241
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

1:38:27.407 --> 1:38:28.492
This is our guy.

1:38:29.326 --> 1:38:32.412
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

1:38:44.466 --> 1:38:45.592
Bogies inbound.

1:38:45.717 --> 1:38:46.426
Skipper.

1:38:54.768 --> 1:38:56.311
-All stop.

1:38:56.478 --> 1:38:57.729
All stop. Aye.

1:39:16.665 --> 1:39:17.708
Hey.

1:39:18.208 --> 1:39:19.418
You Scoresby?

1:39:20.794 --> 1:39:23.714
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

1:39:24.256 --> 1:39:25.465
That would
be me.

1:39:27.050 --> 1:39:30.053
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

1:39:30.846 --> 1:39:32.014
Never been up there.

1:39:33.223 --> 1:39:35.684
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

1:39:36.351 --> 1:39:39.813
Metkayina, mostly. Some
Ta'unui. Maybe fifty villages.

1:39:39.980 --> 1:39:41.398
And you
are who?

1:39:42.524 --> 1:39:43.817
I'm Ian Garvin.

1:39:45.110 --> 1:39:46.528
Marine biologist.

1:39:46.695 --> 1:39:47.905
Fifty villages.

1:39:48.030 --> 1:39:50.240
A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

1:39:51.408 --> 1:39:52.701
I hunt tulkun.

1:39:53.368 --> 1:39:55.704
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

1:39:55.871 --> 1:39:57.456
I've got quotas to meet.

1:39:58.624 --> 1:40:00.542
I'll be nice once.

1:40:01.251 --> 1:40:02.252
Then I won't.

1:40:05.506 --> 1:40:06.965
Well, if you can't
get out of it...

1:40:08.175 --> 1:40:09.176
get into it!

1:40:10.052 --> 1:40:12.471
-All crews to stations!
-Hey, don't touch.

1:40:14.932 --> 1:40:15.599
Helm,
bring her up.

1:40:15.724 --> 1:40:16.517
Flight speed.

1:40:16.725 --> 1:40:17.976
Flight speed, aye.

1:40:28.737 --> 1:40:30.030
What was that?

1:40:31.281 --> 1:40:32.074
What's going on?

1:40:35.536 --> 1:40:37.329
The tulkun have returned!

1:40:37.496 --> 1:40:40.541
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

1:40:50.759 --> 1:40:52.970
In their endless cycle of migration...

1:40:53.262 --> 1:40:55.180
the tulkun had come home.

1:41:02.521 --> 1:41:03.939
Kiri, come on. Come on!

1:41:04.106 --> 1:41:05.399
Tuk, leave me alone.

1:41:05.524 --> 1:41:06.775
-Come on!
-What?

1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:09.653
What do you want?

1:41:09.987 --> 1:41:10.863
Look.

1:41:19.746 --> 1:41:20.622
Come on.

1:41:21.665 --> 1:41:22.791
Let's go meet them.

1:41:23.584 --> 1:41:24.209
Look...

1:41:24.334 --> 1:41:25.669
it's my Spirit Sister.

1:42:48.877 --> 1:42:50.462
It was a time for stories.

1:42:51.672 --> 1:42:52.923
Of their season apart.

1:42:53.757 --> 1:42:54.424
Of deaths...

1:42:54.550 --> 1:42:55.175
and births.

1:42:57.636 --> 1:42:58.679
Of old friends...

1:42:58.804 --> 1:42:59.721
and new loves.

1:43:19.867 --> 1:43:20.826
Children.

1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:24.496
Be calm...

1:43:24.621 --> 1:43:25.664
my people.

1:43:26.123 --> 1:43:27.499
We're looking for weapons...

1:43:27.624 --> 1:43:29.585
comms. Any kind of tech.

1:43:30.085 --> 1:43:30.752
Get down.

1:43:30.919 --> 1:43:31.712
You too.

1:43:31.837 --> 1:43:32.671
You see this?

1:43:33.630 --> 1:43:34.798
Stay down and shut up!

1:43:51.648 --> 1:43:52.691
Now what's
he saying?

1:43:52.858 --> 1:43:53.901
They never
saw him.

1:43:54.026 --> 1:43:54.902
These are
Sea People.

1:43:55.027 --> 1:43:56.570
Forest People
don't come here.

1:43:56.695 --> 1:43:58.238
I ain't buyin' that.

1:44:10.125 --> 1:44:11.668
They don't
know anything.

1:44:14.505 --> 1:44:15.506
Shoot that animal.

1:44:19.593 --> 1:44:20.552
What the hell are you doing?

1:44:32.314 --> 1:44:33.524
Your ears
workin' now?

1:44:34.566 --> 1:44:36.318
You see what
these can do, huh?

1:44:38.612 --> 1:44:39.780
Jake Sully.

1:44:40.822 --> 1:44:43.367
Toruk Makto!

1:44:45.077 --> 1:44:45.994
Put her down!

1:44:46.161 --> 1:44:46.995
Get down!

1:44:48.872 --> 1:44:49.748
Get down!

1:44:50.082 --> 1:44:50.958
Stop!

1:44:51.083 --> 1:44:51.750
Stop!

1:44:51.875 --> 1:44:53.627
You make it real
clear to him.

1:44:54.211 --> 1:44:55.337
He doesn't
give up Sully...

1:44:56.088 --> 1:44:57.381
we kill the Tsahik.

1:44:57.548 --> 1:44:58.882
No, I'm not
doin' that.

1:44:59.049 --> 1:45:00.008
Is that right?

1:45:00.634 --> 1:45:02.302
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

1:45:03.011 --> 1:45:03.637
Get down!

1:45:03.804 --> 1:45:05.222
These people don't
know anything!

1:45:05.389 --> 1:45:06.598
They don't know anything!

1:45:06.765 --> 1:45:07.933
Don't move!

1:45:12.396 --> 1:45:13.355
We really
gonna waste her?

1:45:14.690 --> 1:45:15.524
Please.

1:45:15.691 --> 1:45:17.067
Please don't do this.

1:45:17.192 --> 1:45:18.026
This is wrong.

1:45:18.193 --> 1:45:20.279
What you're
doing here is wrong.

1:45:21.530 --> 1:45:22.364
Please.

1:45:27.578 --> 1:45:28.787
Burn the hooches.

1:45:29.788 --> 1:45:31.290
Hey, light 'em up.

1:45:31.456 --> 1:45:32.916
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

1:45:33.417 --> 1:45:34.543
Flamethrowers up!

1:45:52.019 --> 1:45:53.395
I'm sorry.

1:45:53.562 --> 1:45:54.730
We're outta here.

1:45:56.481 --> 1:45:57.608
Don't touch me!

1:45:58.317 --> 1:45:58.942
I'm sorry.

1:45:59.109 --> 1:46:00.110
Let's go.

1:46:00.485 --> 1:46:01.153
Saddle up.

1:46:01.278 --> 1:46:02.029
All right. Let's go.

1:46:26.970 --> 1:46:27.971
What's wrong?

1:46:28.138 --> 1:46:29.348
Sky People.

1:46:30.974 --> 1:46:32.809
They're looking
for you, Jakesully.

1:46:33.352 --> 1:46:34.186
South.

1:46:34.436 --> 1:46:35.187
They have a human...

1:46:35.312 --> 1:46:37.231
boy who speaks Na'vi.

1:46:41.235 --> 1:46:42.736
Did they kill anybody?

1:46:43.445 --> 1:46:44.821
Not yet.

1:46:46.114 --> 1:46:47.199
They threaten.

1:46:47.616 --> 1:46:50.077
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

1:46:50.410 --> 1:46:51.495
By my order.

1:46:59.461 --> 1:47:01.880
We must hunt
this demon.

1:47:02.047 --> 1:47:03.090
Trap him.

1:47:03.257 --> 1:47:04.174
Kill him.

1:47:05.884 --> 1:47:06.969
We've gotta be smart.

1:47:07.761 --> 1:47:08.762
We gotta be smart.

1:47:08.929 --> 1:47:09.763
If we hit Quaritch...

1:47:09.888 --> 1:47:11.849
they're gonna
know where we are...

1:47:12.015 --> 1:47:14.226
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

1:47:15.644 --> 1:47:16.979
Then what is our plan?

1:47:18.689 --> 1:47:19.940
That's
Toruk Makto!

1:47:20.190 --> 1:47:20.941
Head down.

1:47:21.817 --> 1:47:23.026
Has he been here?

1:47:27.823 --> 1:47:29.032
This shit ain't workin'.

1:47:29.867 --> 1:47:31.159
Nah, they're
stonewallin' us.

1:47:31.910 --> 1:47:33.370
If we turn up the heat...

1:47:33.495 --> 1:47:34.955
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

1:47:35.247 --> 1:47:36.748
We gotta
draw him out.

1:47:46.175 --> 1:47:47.259
I'm over it.

1:47:48.468 --> 1:47:50.637
I've got quotas to meet.

1:47:50.804 --> 1:47:52.389
You wanna hunt?

1:47:52.764 --> 1:47:54.016
Let's hunt.

1:47:55.475 --> 1:47:56.310
Here? Not here.

1:47:56.435 --> 1:47:57.728
There's too many villages.

1:47:57.853 --> 1:47:59.313
No.
No, no, no.

1:48:00.606 --> 1:48:01.815
Respectfully, sir...

1:48:02.482 --> 1:48:03.442
you do not understand...

1:48:03.609 --> 1:48:04.484
the kinship bonds...

1:48:04.610 --> 1:48:06.361
between the tulkun
and the ocean Na'vi.

1:48:06.528 --> 1:48:08.697
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1:48:08.864 --> 1:48:10.157
If we start
hunting here...

1:48:10.282 --> 1:48:12.409
the hostiles
will come after us.

1:48:12.576 --> 1:48:13.702
Exactly.

1:48:14.620 --> 1:48:15.329
One hostile...

1:48:15.454 --> 1:48:16.538
in particular.

1:48:26.798 --> 1:48:28.467
I know how you feel.

1:48:31.220 --> 1:48:34.181
I feel all alone too.

1:48:36.141 --> 1:48:37.434
Tell me.

1:48:37.601 --> 1:48:39.228
Why are you outcast?

1:51:02.621 --> 1:51:03.956
I'm sorry.

1:51:04.122 --> 1:51:05.582
I'm so sorry.

1:51:09.586 --> 1:51:10.587
It's okay.

1:51:11.255 --> 1:51:12.047
It's okay.

1:51:26.728 --> 1:51:28.313
You allowed this.

1:51:29.731 --> 1:51:33.110
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

1:51:35.863 --> 1:51:36.864
Tsireya.

1:51:38.657 --> 1:51:40.284
You disappoint
me, daughter.

1:51:41.577 --> 1:51:42.828
And you...

1:51:42.995 --> 1:51:44.329
son of a
great warrior...

1:51:44.454 --> 1:51:45.956
who has been
taught better.

1:51:46.123 --> 1:51:47.708
Payakan saved
my life, sir.

1:51:47.875 --> 1:51:48.792
You don't
know him.

1:51:48.959 --> 1:51:50.294
No, Lo'ak.

1:51:51.378 --> 1:51:52.379
Sit.

1:51:53.797 --> 1:51:55.048
Sit.

1:51:57.926 --> 1:51:59.303
Sit down!

1:52:03.390 --> 1:52:04.892
Hear my
words, boy.

1:52:06.810 --> 1:52:09.188
In the days of
the First Songs...

1:52:09.563 --> 1:52:11.982
tulkun fought
amongst themselves...

1:52:12.107 --> 1:52:14.151
for territory...

1:52:14.318 --> 1:52:15.652
and for revenge.

1:52:16.653 --> 1:52:18.530
But they came
to believe...

1:52:18.697 --> 1:52:21.283
that killing, no
matter how justified...

1:52:21.450 --> 1:52:24.119
only brings
more killing.

1:52:25.954 --> 1:52:29.249
So all killing
was forbidden.

1:52:29.416 --> 1:52:32.211
This is the
Tulkun Way.

1:52:33.462 --> 1:52:34.463
Payakan...

1:52:35.339 --> 1:52:37.508
is a killer, so...

1:52:37.591 --> 1:52:39.551
he is outcast.

1:52:39.718 --> 1:52:40.719
I'm sorry, sir.

1:52:40.844 --> 1:52:41.637
But you're wrong.

1:52:41.803 --> 1:52:42.554
Lo'ak.

1:52:43.639 --> 1:52:44.681
You speak
to Olo'eyktan!

1:52:44.848 --> 1:52:45.641
I know
what I...

1:52:45.724 --> 1:52:46.725
That's
enough!

1:52:51.063 --> 1:52:52.147
I know what I know.

1:52:55.651 --> 1:52:56.902
That's enough.

1:52:58.695 --> 1:53:00.447
I'll deal with
this one.

1:53:06.620 --> 1:53:08.080
This storm will pass.

1:53:09.623 --> 1:53:13.669
Lo'ak, I saw
something today.

1:53:13.836 --> 1:53:15.462
I saw a
Forest Boy...

1:53:15.587 --> 1:53:16.880
chosen
by tulkun.

1:53:17.798 --> 1:53:20.342
I am very
proud of you.

1:53:20.509 --> 1:53:22.302
Payakan didn't
kill those boys.

1:53:23.095 --> 1:53:24.096
I saw it all.

1:53:24.263 --> 1:53:26.974
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

1:53:27.140 --> 1:53:29.184
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

1:53:29.309 --> 1:53:30.519
to attack the ship.

1:53:31.186 --> 1:53:33.105
And they
were all killed...

1:53:33.564 --> 1:53:35.482
but by the Sky
People. Not by him.

1:53:35.649 --> 1:53:37.484
-He's not a killer.
-No, Lo'ak.

1:53:37.651 --> 1:53:39.987
By the Tulkun
Way, he is.

1:53:40.153 --> 1:53:41.238
He bears
those deaths.

1:53:41.405 --> 1:53:43.782
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1:53:43.949 --> 1:53:46.326
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

1:53:48.078 --> 1:53:49.162
We must tell
my father...

1:53:49.246 --> 1:53:50.163
No. No.

1:53:50.247 --> 1:53:51.498
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

1:53:51.665 --> 1:53:52.875
Your father will
understand this.

1:53:53.041 --> 1:53:53.959
No, he won't.

1:53:54.543 --> 1:53:56.461
He doesn't
understand anything.

1:53:56.628 --> 1:53:58.255
The whole clan
hates me.

1:53:58.422 --> 1:53:59.631
Demon
blood.

1:53:59.798 --> 1:54:01.633
Alien.
That's all they see.

1:54:07.890 --> 1:54:09.641
I See you.

1:54:13.896 --> 1:54:16.481
You are
Brother of Tulkun.

1:54:18.734 --> 1:54:20.694
You are one
of us now.

1:54:37.878 --> 1:54:38.879
You got my mother?

1:54:39.046 --> 1:54:41.840
Mother and calf. Strong
signal. Range 4,000.

1:54:42.007 --> 1:54:42.799
Bring it down...

1:54:42.925 --> 1:54:43.634
on the hull.

1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:45.260
Comin'
down, aye.

1:54:45.427 --> 1:54:46.428
Foils deployed.

1:55:08.742 --> 1:55:09.535
Sub teams...

1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:10.327
two minutes!

1:55:10.410 --> 1:55:11.912
Let's get in there!

1:55:12.079 --> 1:55:14.081
Hatches closed!

1:55:14.248 --> 1:55:15.123
Come on,
hustle!

1:55:15.249 --> 1:55:16.166
Hustle!

1:55:16.333 --> 1:55:18.210
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

1:55:18.377 --> 1:55:19.628
Let's make
some bank.

1:55:20.796 --> 1:55:22.089
Boat crews!

1:55:22.256 --> 1:55:24.842
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

1:55:30.138 --> 1:55:31.974
All boats in! Boats in!

1:55:36.603 --> 1:55:38.063
Let's go,
baby!

1:55:48.949 --> 1:55:50.158
We're rollin'!

1:56:16.518 --> 1:56:17.978
Stand by
depth charges...

1:56:18.145 --> 1:56:20.147
and fire, fire, fire!

1:56:42.544 --> 1:56:43.420
What's that?

1:56:43.504 --> 1:56:44.421
What are
they doin'?

1:56:45.714 --> 1:56:47.424
Those are
echolocation sensors.

1:56:47.591 --> 1:56:48.926
How they navigate.

1:56:49.092 --> 1:56:50.093
They have to hold...

1:56:50.219 --> 1:56:50.844
them out
of the water...

1:56:51.011 --> 1:56:52.095
or they'll
go deaf.

1:56:53.096 --> 1:56:54.097
Picadors!

1:56:54.473 --> 1:56:55.182
Get in there!

1:56:55.265 --> 1:56:55.891
Go on.

1:56:55.974 --> 1:56:56.600
Get in there.

1:56:56.683 --> 1:56:57.643
Get up in there!

1:57:13.659 --> 1:57:15.911
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

1:57:16.078 --> 1:57:17.746
using the
sound cannon.

1:57:17.913 --> 1:57:19.831
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:22.918
and she won't
leave the calf.

1:57:23.335 --> 1:57:24.962
Do they ever
fight back?

1:57:25.128 --> 1:57:27.506
Nah, never seen
'em lift a fin.

1:57:28.131 --> 1:57:30.050
Tough bastards
to kill though.

1:57:31.343 --> 1:57:32.928
Sub teams, go!

1:57:33.470 --> 1:57:34.304
And release.

1:57:38.475 --> 1:57:40.185
Release,
release.

1:57:44.982 --> 1:57:45.983
There's
our gal.

1:57:46.149 --> 1:57:47.150
Target
in sight.

1:57:47.651 --> 1:57:49.111
3-6 is in hot
with harpoons.

1:57:49.278 --> 1:57:50.445
Here we go,
baby.

1:57:51.905 --> 1:57:53.866
See, we go
in from below...

1:57:53.991 --> 1:57:55.826
where there's
gaps in the armor.

1:57:59.705 --> 1:58:01.290
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

1:58:01.456 --> 1:58:02.457
I'm
goin' in.

1:58:02.624 --> 1:58:03.917
Get me
in close.

1:58:07.462 --> 1:58:08.463
Hold her steady.

1:58:08.630 --> 1:58:10.174
In range.
Arm one.

1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:12.009
Arming,
target lock.

1:58:12.176 --> 1:58:13.302
And
one away.

1:58:19.641 --> 1:58:21.059
Two's in hot.

1:58:21.226 --> 1:58:22.227
-Arm one.
-Arming.

1:58:22.394 --> 1:58:23.437
Fire.

1:58:27.608 --> 1:58:28.567
Good strike.
Arm two.

1:58:28.650 --> 1:58:29.276
Arming.

1:58:29.359 --> 1:58:30.402
Two away.

1:58:31.695 --> 1:58:32.696
Booyah!

1:58:32.863 --> 1:58:33.780
Nice.

1:58:33.947 --> 1:58:35.574
3-6, you owe
us a beer.

1:58:40.370 --> 1:58:42.414
You see, the bags
slow her down...

1:58:42.539 --> 1:58:43.790
and keep her up
at the surface.

1:58:43.957 --> 1:58:44.958
Yeah.

1:58:45.125 --> 1:58:46.251
Get on her!

1:58:46.418 --> 1:58:47.711
Get me in there.

1:58:47.878 --> 1:58:49.254
Straight up on her.

1:58:49.505 --> 1:58:50.506
30 meters.

1:58:51.381 --> 1:58:52.966
Explosive-tipped
harpoon.

1:58:53.509 --> 1:58:56.178
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

1:58:56.678 --> 1:58:57.846
Now steady,
steady.

1:58:57.930 --> 1:58:58.972
Stay
with her.

1:58:59.306 --> 1:59:00.891
Hold. Hold.

1:59:03.060 --> 1:59:04.269
Line's runnin'!

1:59:11.109 --> 1:59:13.237
Hold on to your
ponytail, Colonel!

1:59:24.164 --> 1:59:25.249
Hold back full!

1:59:25.415 --> 1:59:26.750
Back full, aye.

1:59:33.423 --> 1:59:34.591
Hold her.

1:59:34.758 --> 1:59:35.884
Hold her.

1:59:39.179 --> 1:59:41.849
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

1:59:41.974 --> 1:59:43.392
and she's
still runnin'.

1:59:44.309 --> 1:59:45.936
Beautiful.

2:00:59.801 --> 2:01:02.596
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

2:01:02.763 --> 2:01:04.973
We drill up through
the hard palate...

2:01:05.891 --> 2:01:07.893
into the brain. And...

2:01:11.688 --> 2:01:13.941
These are highly
intelligent beings.

2:01:14.107 --> 2:01:15.067
Probably smarter
than us.

2:01:15.234 --> 2:01:16.485
Not smarter than me.

2:01:16.652 --> 2:01:18.111
That is setting
the bar very low.

2:01:18.278 --> 2:01:19.821
Hey, I'm the one
with the harpoon.

2:01:21.406 --> 2:01:22.407
Yep.

2:01:33.502 --> 2:01:34.503
How do
you know?

2:01:34.670 --> 2:01:35.921
That they're
smarter than us?

2:01:36.755 --> 2:01:38.423
More neurons, more pathways.

2:01:39.299 --> 2:01:41.468
Not only are they
smarter, they're...

2:01:41.593 --> 2:01:42.845
deeply
emotional.

2:01:43.762 --> 2:01:45.013
More spiritual.

2:01:49.351 --> 2:01:52.271
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

2:01:52.437 --> 2:01:54.898
but proportionally
it's much larger.

2:01:56.275 --> 2:01:57.818
They have music...

2:01:57.985 --> 2:01:59.528
philosophy...

2:01:59.695 --> 2:02:01.280
mathematics...

2:02:01.780 --> 2:02:03.115
complex language.

2:02:03.699 --> 2:02:04.324
Okay.

2:02:05.117 --> 2:02:06.243
Here we go.

2:02:07.035 --> 2:02:08.412
Show me
the money.

2:02:13.125 --> 2:02:15.127
So that's what this is all about?

2:02:15.752 --> 2:02:17.087
That's it.

2:02:17.254 --> 2:02:18.255
Amrita.

2:02:21.175 --> 2:02:23.093
Bad luck for the big guys.

2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:26.513
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

2:02:27.097 --> 2:02:28.473
stops it.

2:02:30.976 --> 2:02:33.187
Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...

2:02:33.312 --> 2:02:35.272
substance known to man.

2:02:36.982 --> 2:02:38.984
This little vial
here is worth like...

2:02:40.152 --> 2:02:41.403
80 million.

2:02:42.446 --> 2:02:43.322
Think fast!

2:02:44.656 --> 2:02:45.824
Please don't.

2:02:47.075 --> 2:02:47.951
It's never funny.

2:02:48.994 --> 2:02:52.164
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

2:02:53.123 --> 2:02:55.542
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

2:02:55.709 --> 2:02:57.002
It's why I drink.

2:02:59.421 --> 2:03:00.506
That's all you take?

2:03:01.798 --> 2:03:03.842
I mean, you just
waste the rest?

2:03:05.385 --> 2:03:06.970
Drop the bags.

2:03:07.554 --> 2:03:08.722
Let's sink her!

2:03:08.889 --> 2:03:10.974
No. Leave
the bags.

2:03:11.350 --> 2:03:13.143
I want 'em to know it was us.

2:03:13.810 --> 2:03:17.189
I charge extra for
bein' used as bait.

2:03:51.473 --> 2:03:53.976
Her name is Ro'a.

2:03:56.353 --> 2:03:59.189
She was my Spirit Sister.

2:04:01.567 --> 2:04:04.319
She was a
composer of songs.

2:04:04.486 --> 2:04:05.779
Much revered.

2:04:05.946 --> 2:04:07.197
We would
sing together.

2:04:08.866 --> 2:04:12.536
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

2:04:13.036 --> 2:04:15.289
The clan were
so happy for her.

2:04:18.417 --> 2:04:20.335
What is this, Tonowari?

2:04:23.088 --> 2:04:24.756
What is this?

2:04:44.318 --> 2:04:47.237
My Spirit Sister
and her baby...

2:04:47.404 --> 2:04:49.948
have been murdered
by the Sky People!

2:04:51.283 --> 2:04:53.493
This war has come to us.

2:04:54.328 --> 2:04:55.871
We knew
about this hunting...

2:04:55.996 --> 2:04:57.748
of our
tulkun people.

2:04:57.915 --> 2:04:59.291
But it was
over the horizon...

2:04:59.708 --> 2:05:00.834
far away.

2:05:01.001 --> 2:05:02.794
Now it
is here!

2:05:06.548 --> 2:05:07.549
No, you don't...

2:05:07.716 --> 2:05:09.843
You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

2:05:10.010 --> 2:05:11.720
They don't care
about the Great Balance.

2:05:11.887 --> 2:05:13.430
We don't answer
to Sky People!

2:05:13.597 --> 2:05:15.432
Listen. Listen to him.

2:05:15.599 --> 2:05:16.725
The Sky People
are not gonna stop.

2:05:16.892 --> 2:05:17.809
This is only
the beginning.

2:05:17.976 --> 2:05:20.020
You gotta tell
your tulkun to leave.

2:05:21.188 --> 2:05:23.190
You gotta tell them
to go far away!

2:05:23.524 --> 2:05:24.274
Leave?

2:05:25.943 --> 2:05:27.152
You live
among us...

2:05:28.278 --> 2:05:30.072
and you
learn nothing!

2:05:30.197 --> 2:05:33.367
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

2:05:33.534 --> 2:05:34.701
No, no, no.

2:05:36.328 --> 2:05:37.412
If you attack...

2:05:37.579 --> 2:05:39.289
if you fight...

2:05:39.456 --> 2:05:40.791
then they will
destroy you!

2:05:40.958 --> 2:05:41.750
They will destroy...

2:05:41.875 --> 2:05:42.918
everything
that you love.

2:05:43.877 --> 2:05:44.545
No!

2:05:44.670 --> 2:05:45.838
You hear
my words!

2:05:46.463 --> 2:05:47.464
Hear my words!

2:05:47.631 --> 2:05:48.632
Stay calm.

2:05:48.799 --> 2:05:49.633
Stay
calm!

2:05:50.342 --> 2:05:51.343
Listen to my father.

2:05:51.510 --> 2:05:52.344
Damn it!

2:05:52.511 --> 2:05:53.762
He speaks the truth.

2:06:03.772 --> 2:06:05.107
You tell the tulkun...

2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:08.360
that if they're hit
by one of these...

2:06:08.485 --> 2:06:09.653
they're marked for death.

2:06:12.739 --> 2:06:13.615
And call for me...

2:06:13.740 --> 2:06:14.950
I'll silence it.

2:06:17.619 --> 2:06:19.538
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

2:06:20.581 --> 2:06:21.915
Right?

2:06:24.418 --> 2:06:26.128
Saving your family.

2:06:38.974 --> 2:06:40.184
Tell the tulkun.

2:06:41.476 --> 2:06:42.477
Go.

2:06:42.895 --> 2:06:43.979
Go!

2:06:47.608 --> 2:06:49.276
We must fight.

2:06:50.402 --> 2:06:51.987
MaJake.

2:06:52.154 --> 2:06:53.739
I will not stand and
do nothing!

2:06:54.573 --> 2:06:56.783
It's a trap. They
want us to hit back.

2:06:57.534 --> 2:06:59.119
They're not hunting tulkun.

2:06:59.286 --> 2:07:00.787
They're hunting us.

2:07:15.344 --> 2:07:17.262
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

2:07:17.429 --> 2:07:19.014
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

2:07:19.681 --> 2:07:20.390
No.

2:07:20.557 --> 2:07:22.476
You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

2:07:22.643 --> 2:07:23.685
He's outcast.

2:07:23.852 --> 2:07:25.604
There's nobody
to warn him but me.

2:07:25.771 --> 2:07:26.563
Bro...

2:07:27.814 --> 2:07:29.858
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

2:07:31.443 --> 2:07:32.486
No.

2:07:32.653 --> 2:07:35.239
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

2:07:36.615 --> 2:07:38.075
The perfect
little soldier.

2:07:38.867 --> 2:07:40.118
Well,
I'm not you!

2:07:40.786 --> 2:07:41.620
Okay?

2:07:42.287 --> 2:07:43.038
I'm not you.

2:07:44.456 --> 2:07:45.791
He's my brother.

2:07:45.958 --> 2:07:47.000
I'm going.

2:07:47.167 --> 2:07:48.544
He's your
brother?

2:07:49.711 --> 2:07:51.630
No, I'm
your brother.

2:07:51.797 --> 2:07:52.631
Lo'ak!

2:07:53.215 --> 2:07:54.299
Get off me.

2:07:55.509 --> 2:07:56.343
Lo'ak!

2:07:56.510 --> 2:07:57.177
Come back!

2:07:57.302 --> 2:07:57.928
Come on.

2:07:58.053 --> 2:07:59.096
He's going to Payakan.

2:08:11.191 --> 2:08:12.317
Come back!

2:08:13.485 --> 2:08:14.945
There's
Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

2:08:15.320 --> 2:08:16.363
Lo'ak!

2:08:16.530 --> 2:08:18.073
Lo'ak's going
to find Payakan!

2:08:18.532 --> 2:08:19.366
Wait up!

2:08:21.034 --> 2:08:21.785
Hold on!

2:08:31.128 --> 2:08:32.880
-All crews to stations.
-Sound general call.

2:08:33.046 --> 2:08:35.215
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

2:08:44.099 --> 2:08:45.100
Brother!

2:08:45.517 --> 2:08:46.143
Lo'ak!

2:08:48.645 --> 2:08:49.271
Lo'ak!

2:08:49.354 --> 2:08:49.980
Wait!

2:08:53.275 --> 2:08:54.568
What is it?
What's wrong?

2:08:56.570 --> 2:08:57.738
Shit!

2:08:58.405 --> 2:09:00.324
Stay calm.

2:09:01.074 --> 2:09:02.326
I got this.

2:09:08.790 --> 2:09:09.750
Shit!

2:09:13.962 --> 2:09:15.130
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

2:09:15.797 --> 2:09:16.757
Hurry, the
ship's coming!

2:09:16.882 --> 2:09:17.716
They're over there!

2:09:20.135 --> 2:09:21.386
Bro, come on!

2:09:22.346 --> 2:09:23.639
Bro.

2:09:23.805 --> 2:09:24.515
Come on, bro.

2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:25.265
Hurry!

2:09:25.641 --> 2:09:26.683
Call it in!

2:09:26.808 --> 2:09:27.726
Call Dad!

2:09:28.268 --> 2:09:29.436
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

2:09:29.603 --> 2:09:30.687
Just do it.

2:09:31.522 --> 2:09:33.482
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

2:09:33.649 --> 2:09:34.816
Did you see
where they went?

2:09:34.942 --> 2:09:35.859
It's Eagle Eye,
do you copy?

2:09:35.984 --> 2:09:37.402
-They went outside the reef.
-Yeah, Lo'ak.

2:09:37.569 --> 2:09:38.195
Dad!

2:09:39.655 --> 2:09:41.949
We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

2:09:42.115 --> 2:09:43.200
Killer ship's inbound.

2:09:43.367 --> 2:09:44.743
It's about
two klicks out.

2:09:45.369 --> 2:09:46.036
Who's with you?

2:09:46.119 --> 2:09:46.745
It's all of us.

2:09:46.954 --> 2:09:48.288
Aonung and Tsireya too.

2:09:48.455 --> 2:09:49.831
We're at
Three Brothers Rocks.

2:09:49.998 --> 2:09:51.875
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

2:09:52.042 --> 2:09:52.918
All right? You hear me?

2:09:53.085 --> 2:09:54.127
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

2:09:54.294 --> 2:09:55.128
Yes, sir.

2:09:55.295 --> 2:09:56.421
It's getting closer!

2:09:56.547 --> 2:09:58.674
-Three, two, pull!
-Pull!

2:09:59.633 --> 2:10:01.009
Kids are under attack!

2:10:01.552 --> 2:10:03.470
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

2:10:03.637 --> 2:10:04.888
It's your kids too.

2:10:05.055 --> 2:10:06.098
The demon ship?

2:10:06.265 --> 2:10:06.890
Yes!

2:10:06.974 --> 2:10:07.599
We gotta go!

2:10:07.724 --> 2:10:09.434
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

2:10:13.647 --> 2:10:14.731
You should stay back.

2:10:15.065 --> 2:10:15.941
I ride!

2:10:16.275 --> 2:10:16.900
Come!

2:11:06.366 --> 2:11:08.202
Sub teams, hatches close.

2:11:08.368 --> 2:11:09.828
Two-minute warning.

2:11:16.793 --> 2:11:17.794
Aonung!

2:11:18.754 --> 2:11:19.796
Hurry up! Come on!

2:11:19.963 --> 2:11:21.131
Bro, hurry up!

2:11:23.592 --> 2:11:24.343
Go, go, go!

2:11:28.514 --> 2:11:29.681
Pull! Now!

2:11:31.642 --> 2:11:33.352
-Everybody! Together!
-Pull!

2:11:37.189 --> 2:11:38.565
I'll be damned.

2:11:39.816 --> 2:11:41.026
Sully's kids.

2:11:41.485 --> 2:11:43.153
Let's roll.
Not you.

2:11:43.737 --> 2:11:44.738
Saddle up.

2:11:56.500 --> 2:11:58.126
Range is 700 meters.

2:11:58.293 --> 2:11:59.878
Pinger signal is good.

2:12:01.755 --> 2:12:03.131
Pull, harder!

2:12:03.298 --> 2:12:04.508
Pull!

2:12:05.259 --> 2:12:06.593
Pull, harder!

2:12:06.760 --> 2:12:07.719
Go!

2:12:08.178 --> 2:12:09.805
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

2:12:09.930 --> 2:12:10.931
Go.
Tuk, go.

2:12:11.390 --> 2:12:13.058
Come on. Get out of here!

2:12:13.225 --> 2:12:14.226
Go that way!

2:12:14.351 --> 2:12:14.977
I'll draw
them off.

2:12:15.102 --> 2:12:16.436
-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

2:12:18.105 --> 2:12:19.481
Go, go, dive!

2:12:19.648 --> 2:12:21.066
Now, dive!

2:12:21.191 --> 2:12:21.859
Grab on.

2:12:31.869 --> 2:12:32.953
Range 300.

2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:34.830
Ready depth charges...

2:12:34.997 --> 2:12:37.332
and fire, fire, fire.

2:12:43.255 --> 2:12:44.631
No depth charges.

2:12:44.756 --> 2:12:46.008
Scoresby,
you copy?

2:12:46.133 --> 2:12:47.759
These kids are
worthless to me dead.

2:12:48.343 --> 2:12:49.761
Hold your fire.

2:12:54.349 --> 2:12:57.102
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

2:12:57.269 --> 2:12:58.604
Get your subs in the water.

2:12:59.521 --> 2:13:01.440
Sub teams, get wet.

2:13:50.989 --> 2:13:52.991
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

2:13:56.787 --> 2:13:58.080
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

2:13:58.580 --> 2:13:59.665
Planes up. We're goin' in!

2:13:59.831 --> 2:14:01.124
Oh, hell yeah!

2:14:32.948 --> 2:14:34.700
Tone on lock.
Two away.

2:15:04.313 --> 2:15:05.272
Where is Tuk?

2:15:05.397 --> 2:15:06.231
Did you see her?

2:15:22.915 --> 2:15:23.916
Tuk!

2:15:26.543 --> 2:15:27.461
Target in sight.

2:15:32.049 --> 2:15:33.258
It is coming.

2:15:33.425 --> 2:15:34.718
We gotta go!

2:15:51.109 --> 2:15:52.152
-Switch net.
-Switching.

2:15:52.277 --> 2:15:53.028
Fire.

2:16:13.507 --> 2:16:14.258
Hold on!

2:16:14.633 --> 2:16:15.509
Let me out!

2:16:16.134 --> 2:16:17.135
-Watch out!
-Tuk, move!

2:16:17.302 --> 2:16:18.220
Move your hand! Move your hand!

2:16:18.387 --> 2:16:20.138
-Cut it!
-Hurry, hurry!

2:16:24.601 --> 2:16:26.186
Hey, kid, get back here!

2:16:31.942 --> 2:16:32.567
Drop the weapon.

2:16:32.692 --> 2:16:33.568
-Put the weapon down!
-Put it down.

2:16:34.027 --> 2:16:34.861
Put it down!

2:16:37.072 --> 2:16:37.781
Stay down.

2:16:38.699 --> 2:16:40.575
-Hey, kid, get back here!
-Get him! Get him!

2:16:40.825 --> 2:16:42.076
Put the weapon down!

2:16:42.494 --> 2:16:43.412
Drop it, now!

2:16:43.620 --> 2:16:44.996
-Put it down!
-Drop the knife.

2:16:45.163 --> 2:16:46.164
Drop it.

2:16:46.748 --> 2:16:48.666
Hey! Hey, what are
you doing? Stop!

2:16:48.834 --> 2:16:49.959
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

2:16:51.545 --> 2:16:52.212
Stop moving.

2:16:52.421 --> 2:16:54.423
-Spider!
-Bro, you okay?

2:16:54.923 --> 2:16:56.174
Yeah. Great, cuz.

2:16:56.341 --> 2:16:57.384
Never better.

2:17:00.219 --> 2:17:01.221
Knock it off.
Stay still.

2:17:04.183 --> 2:17:05.183
Get back
to the bridge.

2:17:06.809 --> 2:17:07.811
Keep him there!

2:17:07.977 --> 2:17:09.396
I'm going,
I'm going.

2:17:10.564 --> 2:17:11.690
Yeah.

2:17:11.857 --> 2:17:12.983
I remember you.

2:17:14.151 --> 2:17:15.777
Cuff 'em to the
rail. All of 'em.

2:17:15.903 --> 2:17:16.611
Let's go.

2:17:17.571 --> 2:17:18.822
Let's go. Move!

2:17:18.906 --> 2:17:19.615
Over here.

2:17:19.698 --> 2:17:20.699
Watch 'em.
They bite.

2:17:21.867 --> 2:17:22.534
Get on your knees.

2:17:22.618 --> 2:17:23.243
On 'em.

2:17:23.326 --> 2:17:23.951
Give me your hand.

2:17:24.036 --> 2:17:24.702
No!

2:17:25.995 --> 2:17:26.621
Now the other.

2:17:26.746 --> 2:17:27.748
No.

2:17:31.709 --> 2:17:32.710
Be brave.

2:17:37.382 --> 2:17:38.467
Na'vi inbound!

2:17:40.928 --> 2:17:41.929
Spread out.
Weapons up.

2:17:42.012 --> 2:17:42.638
Dad!

2:17:42.763 --> 2:17:44.348
Push left.
Spread out.

2:17:46.767 --> 2:17:47.768
Stop.
Stop them.

2:17:51.897 --> 2:17:53.232
It's Sully.

2:17:55.484 --> 2:17:56.485
300 yards.

2:18:02.491 --> 2:18:03.825
They got our kids.

2:18:03.992 --> 2:18:05.285
Your daughter.

2:18:05.451 --> 2:18:06.452
Tuk. Lo'ak.

2:18:09.456 --> 2:18:10.082
Jake...

2:18:10.665 --> 2:18:12.793
tell your friends
to stand down.

2:18:13.919 --> 2:18:15.879
You want your kids back...

2:18:16.046 --> 2:18:17.589
you come out alone.

2:18:20.384 --> 2:18:22.511
You know better
than to test my resolve.

2:18:23.846 --> 2:18:24.972
Lo'ak!
No!

2:18:28.058 --> 2:18:30.018
I took you under my wing, Jake.

2:18:30.561 --> 2:18:32.478
You betrayed me.

2:18:32.646 --> 2:18:34.022
You killed your own.

2:18:34.189 --> 2:18:36.023
Good men.
Good women.

2:18:36.191 --> 2:18:39.278
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

2:18:40.779 --> 2:18:41.780
Just wait one.

2:18:53.125 --> 2:18:54.251
Hold here.

2:18:55.252 --> 2:18:57.129
They are
killers of tulkun.

2:18:57.754 --> 2:18:58.964
They must die.

2:18:59.130 --> 2:19:00.924
Here. Today.

2:19:01.091 --> 2:19:02.718
It's me that they want.

2:19:02.885 --> 2:19:04.386
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

2:19:04.553 --> 2:19:06.972
The hunting of our tulkun.
The taking of our kids.

2:19:10.100 --> 2:19:12.019
You brought
this upon us!

2:19:12.477 --> 2:19:13.562
You!

2:19:17.398 --> 2:19:19.151
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

2:19:25.406 --> 2:19:27.242
Offer's fixin' to expire.

2:19:27.409 --> 2:19:28.951
What's it gonna be?

2:19:29.702 --> 2:19:31.163
Check your fire.

2:19:31.330 --> 2:19:32.496
I'm comin' out.

2:19:43.592 --> 2:19:44.300
MaJake...

2:19:44.425 --> 2:19:45.218
what is happening?

2:19:46.136 --> 2:19:47.221
MaJake?

2:19:49.890 --> 2:19:52.601
Stay tense everybody.
All weapons.

2:20:09.952 --> 2:20:11.537
Easy shot.

2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:14.206
You hit him
now, they attack.

2:20:15.499 --> 2:20:17.459
Wait till
he's on board.

2:20:44.278 --> 2:20:45.654
Payakan!

2:20:57.332 --> 2:20:58.292
Open fire.
Open fire!

2:21:00.878 --> 2:21:01.628
Brother!

2:21:06.633 --> 2:21:08.260
-Come about!
-Comin' about!

2:21:08.385 --> 2:21:09.720
Get me around!

2:21:10.512 --> 2:21:11.346
Get me a shot!

2:21:12.472 --> 2:21:14.308
Go, go!

2:21:32.993 --> 2:21:34.119
Get me around!

2:21:34.286 --> 2:21:35.704
Go, go, go!

2:21:37.497 --> 2:21:38.123
Get in there...

2:21:38.290 --> 2:21:40.125
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

2:21:49.259 --> 2:21:49.968
Down!

2:21:53.347 --> 2:21:54.848
Bloody hell!

2:21:59.019 --> 2:21:59.811
Open fire!

2:22:00.646 --> 2:22:01.438
Open fire!

2:22:05.734 --> 2:22:06.944
Sully's inbound.

2:22:07.110 --> 2:22:08.320
I want eyes on!

2:22:08.612 --> 2:22:10.531
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

2:22:52.489 --> 2:22:54.575
Somebody
shoot something!

2:23:10.299 --> 2:23:10.924
Stop!

2:24:06.730 --> 2:24:07.981
Get after them. Go!

2:24:25.207 --> 2:24:27.125
Breach!
Masks on!

2:24:27.459 --> 2:24:28.877
Masks

2:25:08.625 --> 2:25:09.960
Get him
out of here!

2:25:15.007 --> 2:25:16.008
Calm down!

2:25:30.230 --> 2:25:31.356
Go, go, go!

2:25:44.912 --> 2:25:46.163
Damage report!

2:25:46.330 --> 2:25:47.080
Flooding.

2:25:47.206 --> 2:25:48.123
Compartment
two and three.

2:25:48.707 --> 2:25:49.458
You okay?

2:26:19.196 --> 2:26:20.197
Port bow!

2:26:21.323 --> 2:26:22.407
Hard port!

2:26:22.533 --> 2:26:23.200
Open fire!

2:26:24.243 --> 2:26:25.452
Get me a shot!

2:26:26.495 --> 2:26:27.162
Got ya!

2:26:45.013 --> 2:26:46.598
Cut us away!

2:26:46.765 --> 2:26:47.850

2:26:48.225 --> 2:26:50.018
Get us off the cable!

2:26:50.185 --> 2:26:52.104
Who's got the
harpoon now?

2:26:56.567 --> 2:26:57.776
Back full!

2:27:09.371 --> 2:27:10.497
Reload!

2:27:13.750 --> 2:27:15.586
Not the cable,
you idiot!

2:27:16.837 --> 2:27:18.046
We're dead
in the water.

2:27:19.381 --> 2:27:20.966
Taking on water. Pumps on.

2:27:21.717 --> 2:27:23.010
Man your
weapons!

2:27:23.177 --> 2:27:25.554
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

2:27:25.804 --> 2:27:27.264
Shut ya cakehole,
Garvin.

2:27:29.433 --> 2:27:30.642
Where are you?

2:27:31.310 --> 2:27:32.644
Cheeky bugger.

2:27:32.811 --> 2:27:34.730
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

2:27:49.995 --> 2:27:51.079
Get down!

2:28:03.217 --> 2:28:04.218
Pumps aren't working.

2:28:04.384 --> 2:28:05.177
Abandon ship!

2:28:05.302 --> 2:28:06.178
Abandon ship!

2:28:06.345 --> 2:28:07.638
-Get him to a boat!
-All crew to the boats.

2:28:07.804 --> 2:28:09.681
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

2:28:15.145 --> 2:28:16.438
Neteyam!

2:28:16.980 --> 2:28:18.065
Hey,
baby brother.

2:28:18.232 --> 2:28:19.316
Need some help?

2:28:19.816 --> 2:28:20.859
Shut up. Come on.

2:28:20.984 --> 2:28:21.777
Get us loose.

2:28:24.863 --> 2:28:27.032
-Okay, get Tuk out of here.
-Bro, hurry up!

2:28:28.825 --> 2:28:30.410
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on.

2:28:30.536 --> 2:28:31.328
Say it.

2:28:31.954 --> 2:28:33.330
-Bro!
-Come on. Let's go.

2:28:35.123 --> 2:28:36.166
Lo'ak!

2:28:37.042 --> 2:28:38.043
They've
got Spider.

2:28:38.210 --> 2:28:39.920
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

2:28:40.295 --> 2:28:41.296
Come on, bro.

2:28:41.505 --> 2:28:42.714
We can't
leave him.

2:28:50.848 --> 2:28:51.890
Let me go!

2:28:54.101 --> 2:28:55.310
No!

2:28:57.479 --> 2:28:58.313
Look!

2:29:05.153 --> 2:29:06.822
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

2:29:06.989 --> 2:29:09.157
I'm not your
buttercup, perv!

2:29:09.324 --> 2:29:10.576
We've got to go
back for her.

2:29:11.702 --> 2:29:12.703
Tuk, wait!

2:29:12.870 --> 2:29:14.413
Sullys
stick together.

2:29:26.133 --> 2:29:27.676
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

2:29:28.677 --> 2:29:29.761
Clear to drop!

2:29:31.138 --> 2:29:32.389
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

2:29:32.556 --> 2:29:33.682
I'm good,
dumbass.

2:29:36.852 --> 2:29:37.853
Move, move!

2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:39.188
Evacuating,
people.

2:29:43.442 --> 2:29:44.193
Tuk...

2:29:44.443 --> 2:29:45.986
this is not a good idea.

2:29:46.153 --> 2:29:47.112
Tuk!

2:30:07.382 --> 2:30:08.258
Cut it here.

2:30:11.512 --> 2:30:12.137
No!

2:30:18.519 --> 2:30:19.520
I got her.

2:30:26.151 --> 2:30:27.319
We can still
get this done.

2:30:27.486 --> 2:30:28.445
Hell yeah.

2:30:29.321 --> 2:30:31.782
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

2:30:57.975 --> 2:30:58.934

2:30:59.059 --> 2:30:59.685

2:31:08.443 --> 2:31:09.486

Okay.

2:33:09.982 --> 2:33:10.732

We got you.

2:33:12.276 --> 2:33:13.026
Oh, no.

2:33:15.237 --> 2:33:16.196

2:33:16.321 --> 2:33:17.114
Put pressure

It's okay, son.

2:33:39.011 --> 2:33:40.095

It's okay. It's okay.

2:33:44.975 --> 2:33:45.976
Dad, I...

2:33:53.066 --> 2:33:54.067

Please.

2:34:17.758 --> 2:34:19.218
Oh, my son.

2:34:19.343 --> 2:34:20.844
My son.

2:34:20.969 --> 2:34:21.929
No!

2:34:27.851 --> 2:34:29.353
My son!

2:34:32.856 --> 2:34:34.274
No!

2:34:36.026 --> 2:34:37.611
No!

2:34:38.278 --> 2:34:40.489
Can you hear
me, Corporal?

2:34:42.658 --> 2:34:45.369
Yeah, yeah,
I think you can.

2:34:46.328 --> 2:34:47.579
I got your daughters.

2:34:50.290 --> 2:34:51.708
Same deal as before.

2:34:53.335 --> 2:34:54.336
You for them.

2:34:55.546 --> 2:34:57.297
No!

2:34:59.675 --> 2:35:01.134
Where are your sisters?

2:35:03.095 --> 2:35:04.596
Your sisters.
Where are they?

2:35:05.514 --> 2:35:06.515
I don't know.

2:35:06.682 --> 2:35:07.850
-Where are they?
-They're on the ship.

2:35:08.016 --> 2:35:09.810
They're tied up on the ship.

2:35:09.977 --> 2:35:11.186
They're at the moon pool.

2:35:11.812 --> 2:35:13.939
At the well deck. Midships.

2:35:14.064 --> 2:35:14.940
What?

2:35:15.399 --> 2:35:16.567
Come on. I'll show you.

Come on.

2:35:18.193 --> 2:35:18.819
I'll show you.

2:35:18.902 --> 2:35:20.237
Talk to me,
Corporal.

2:35:20.404 --> 2:35:21.947
-Z, up top.
-I need somethin', Jake...

2:35:22.114 --> 2:35:23.657
or there's gonna
be consequences.

2:35:24.658 --> 2:35:25.659
Yeah, I hear you.

2:35:26.785 --> 2:35:27.786
-Come on.
-Come on!

2:35:27.953 --> 2:35:30.205
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

2:35:30.581 --> 2:35:31.915
-No!
-Let's go.

2:35:32.082 --> 2:35:34.877
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.

2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:38.672
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2:35:38.755 --> 2:35:40.007
They have our daughters.

2:35:40.174 --> 2:35:41.425
They have our daughters.

2:35:44.678 --> 2:35:46.889
I need you
with me.

2:35:48.098 --> 2:35:49.641
And I need you
to be strong.

2:35:50.184 --> 2:35:51.602
Right now.

2:35:51.768 --> 2:35:52.978
Strong heart.

2:35:54.396 --> 2:35:55.647
Strong heart.

2:36:09.286 --> 2:36:10.621
Let's go get our daughters.

2:36:25.594 --> 2:36:27.095
You stay with your brother.

2:36:27.638 --> 2:36:29.056
Dad, I want
to go with you.

2:36:32.059 --> 2:36:33.060
You've done enough.

2:36:33.227 --> 2:36:34.269
Dad...

2:36:39.066 --> 2:36:40.067
Hold fire.

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:42.361
Let's go.

2:36:43.403 --> 2:36:44.404
He's coming.

2:36:46.281 --> 2:36:47.199
I'm good. Go, go!

2:36:49.660 --> 2:36:50.786
Let's get
this guy.

2:36:50.911 --> 2:36:52.120
It's what we
came here for.

2:36:57.334 --> 2:36:58.335
Stay with him.

2:36:58.877 --> 2:36:59.962
No...

2:37:00.796 --> 2:37:02.130
Heads on a swivel, guys.

2:37:23.527 --> 2:37:24.152
Go.

2:37:32.619 --> 2:37:33.620
Where are they?

2:37:33.787 --> 2:37:34.496
The middle deck.

2:37:34.621 --> 2:37:35.539
Where they
launch the subs.

2:37:35.706 --> 2:37:37.124
There's, like,
a pool in the center.

2:37:38.083 --> 2:37:39.209
They're at the forward railing.

2:37:41.795 --> 2:37:42.796
No, no.
Stay here.

2:37:45.966 --> 2:37:47.134
Talk to me,
Corporal.

2:37:48.093 --> 2:37:49.178
This ship's
going down...

2:37:49.344 --> 2:37:50.512
and your girls with it.

2:37:52.264 --> 2:37:53.849
Your boy
didn't have to die.

2:37:54.266 --> 2:37:55.934
You brought
that on yourself.

2:38:03.108 --> 2:38:05.944
You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.

2:38:08.322 --> 2:38:10.032
Only one way to keep
them safe.

2:38:13.911 --> 2:38:15.913
So let's get this
over with before

2:38:16.038 --> 2:38:16.955
you lose another kid.

2:38:28.717 --> 2:38:29.843
Get down!

2:39:12.261 --> 2:39:13.345
-Who's down?
-Zdinarsik, you copy?

2:39:13.470 --> 2:39:14.513
Sound off!

2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:15.430
Clear!

2:39:16.723 --> 2:39:18.100
Prager.
You read?

2:39:20.143 --> 2:39:21.144
Eyes up.
Eyes up!

2:39:30.404 --> 2:39:31.405
Move up!

2:39:33.949 --> 2:39:34.950
Push left. Go!

2:39:35.659 --> 2:39:36.827
Push right. Get around on her.

2:39:37.286 --> 2:39:38.161
Who's got eyes?

2:40:23.665 --> 2:40:24.416
MaJake.

2:40:31.089 --> 2:40:32.216
It's Mom!

2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:39.806
That's right.

2:40:40.182 --> 2:40:42.100
They're coming for you.

2:41:32.943 --> 2:41:33.944
Dad! Dad.

2:41:37.322 --> 2:41:38.574
Okay.
Where's your sister?

2:41:38.699 --> 2:41:39.366
Where is she?

2:41:39.533 --> 2:41:40.993
That way.

2:41:41.451 --> 2:41:42.452
Okay, stay behind me.

2:41:47.749 --> 2:41:48.709
Kiri!

2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:51.461
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

2:41:53.255 --> 2:41:56.216
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

2:41:57.092 --> 2:41:58.427
Do not test me!

2:42:00.220 --> 2:42:01.680
Just kill him, Dad!

2:42:04.516 --> 2:42:05.517
Weapons down.

2:42:05.601 --> 2:42:06.226
Don't.

2:42:06.351 --> 2:42:06.977
Don't do it.

2:42:07.060 --> 2:42:07.895
Down!

2:42:10.314 --> 2:42:11.315
Kick 'em away.

2:42:13.525 --> 2:42:14.193
Do it!

2:42:17.362 --> 2:42:18.405
No.

2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:21.241
Cuff yourself.

2:42:21.408 --> 2:42:22.826
No! No, don't
hurt her, okay?

2:42:22.993 --> 2:42:23.994
Stand there!

2:42:24.828 --> 2:42:26.413
-Don't!
-Don't move!

2:42:26.496 --> 2:42:27.372
Not a step.

2:42:28.165 --> 2:42:29.875
Cuffs on. Now.

2:42:30.083 --> 2:42:32.127
You son
of a bitch.

2:42:32.294 --> 2:42:33.795
Please, don't
hurt her.

2:42:37.007 --> 2:42:38.217
Release.

2:42:39.176 --> 2:42:40.177
Or I cut.

2:42:42.763 --> 2:42:44.890
What, you think I
care about some kid?

2:42:46.225 --> 2:42:47.226
He's not mine.

2:42:48.060 --> 2:42:49.853
We're not even the same species.

2:42:50.646 --> 2:42:52.147
Just please don't...

2:42:52.272 --> 2:42:53.023
don't hurt her.

2:42:53.190 --> 2:42:54.691
Just please
let her go.

2:42:54.858 --> 2:42:55.859
-Don't.
-Please!

2:42:56.026 --> 2:42:56.652
Don't kill him.

2:42:56.777 --> 2:42:57.569
Listen to me!

2:42:57.736 --> 2:42:59.196
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

2:42:59.404 --> 2:43:00.864
Mom, don't kill him.

2:43:01.615 --> 2:43:03.909
A son for a son.

2:43:06.119 --> 2:43:07.371
Please don't hurt her.

2:43:09.706 --> 2:43:10.916
I cut.

2:43:11.083 --> 2:43:12.334
Please just let her go...

2:43:12.417 --> 2:43:13.043
okay?

2:43:13.126 --> 2:43:13.836
Just let her go.

2:43:16.046 --> 2:43:16.880
No!

2:43:26.181 --> 2:43:28.433
Kiri... Kiri.

2:43:35.274 --> 2:43:36.275
Spider.

2:43:37.150 --> 2:43:37.776
Spider...

2:43:37.901 --> 2:43:38.986
get 'em out of here.

2:43:39.444 --> 2:43:40.070
Come on.

2:43:40.571 --> 2:43:41.446
Guys. Tuk.

2:43:41.572 --> 2:43:43.365
I owe you
a death.

2:43:44.992 --> 2:43:45.617
Mom.

2:43:45.701 --> 2:43:46.618
-Mama.
-Come.

2:43:46.785 --> 2:43:47.744
Come on.

2:43:47.828 --> 2:43:48.620
Please...

2:43:48.745 --> 2:43:49.371
Mama.

2:43:49.872 --> 2:43:51.373
You're not leaving,
are you, Jake?

2:43:52.165 --> 2:43:53.166
Knowin'
I'm out there.

2:43:54.418 --> 2:43:56.503
Knowin' that
I'll never stop.

2:43:56.879 --> 2:43:58.172
I'm coming for you.

2:43:58.338 --> 2:44:01.049
And when I do, I'll
kill your whole family.

2:44:02.092 --> 2:44:03.010
Dad...

2:44:05.220 --> 2:44:06.138
Then let's get it done.

2:44:16.899 --> 2:44:17.900
Jake!

2:44:22.196 --> 2:44:23.280
-It's coming!
-Back. Back.

2:44:23.447 --> 2:44:24.656
Get back to the ship. Go!

2:44:24.823 --> 2:44:25.824
Tuk, swim, swim.

2:44:28.994 --> 2:44:29.953
Stay close.

2:44:30.204 --> 2:44:31.205
-Keep moving.
-Stay close.

2:44:33.832 --> 2:44:34.458
Tuk!

2:44:35.792 --> 2:44:36.668
Mom, take
my hand!

2:44:36.793 --> 2:44:37.461
Hold on!

2:44:40.797 --> 2:44:41.882
Mom!

2:44:43.550 --> 2:44:44.426
-Kiri, come on.
-No...

2:44:44.593 --> 2:44:45.469
Kiri, we've got
to go, come on.

2:44:45.594 --> 2:44:46.220
No!

2:44:49.473 --> 2:44:50.933
Go! Climb.
Climb!

2:44:51.391 --> 2:44:52.392
Kiri,
come on!

2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:54.603
Come on,
let's go!

2:44:55.354 --> 2:44:55.979
Mom!

2:44:56.104 --> 2:44:56.813
Swim! Swim.

2:44:57.189 --> 2:44:57.856
Go, Tuk.

2:44:57.981 --> 2:44:58.607
Climb up.

2:45:06.323 --> 2:45:06.990
Mom...

2:45:08.116 --> 2:45:09.117
Go!

2:45:09.660 --> 2:45:10.661
Go, go, go!

2:45:18.126 --> 2:45:19.294
Keep climbing!
Go!

2:45:23.841 --> 2:45:24.842
I got you.

2:45:27.177 --> 2:45:28.011
Give me your hand!

2:45:28.136 --> 2:45:28.804
Come on!

2:45:31.431 --> 2:45:32.224
Open it!

2:45:40.899 --> 2:45:41.525
Open it!

2:45:41.608 --> 2:45:42.234
Move back.

2:45:42.317 --> 2:45:42.943
Move back.

2:45:43.652 --> 2:45:44.653
Come.

2:45:46.154 --> 2:45:46.864
Tuk!

2:45:56.957 --> 2:45:57.875
Climb!

2:45:58.166 --> 2:45:59.126
Go!

2:46:01.378 --> 2:46:02.087
Climb!

2:46:02.462 --> 2:46:03.088
Go!

2:46:03.922 --> 2:46:04.715
Go up!

2:46:10.512 --> 2:46:11.513
We're
rolling over!

2:46:11.889 --> 2:46:12.514
Go, go,
go, go!

2:46:12.598 --> 2:46:13.348
Okay...

2:46:15.893 --> 2:46:16.977
No!

2:46:17.436 --> 2:46:18.562
Mom!

2:46:26.695 --> 2:46:27.696
Kiri!

2:46:27.821 --> 2:46:28.530
Keep going!

2:46:32.242 --> 2:46:33.243
This way,
this way!

2:46:33.744 --> 2:46:34.411
Okay.

2:46:34.578 --> 2:46:35.204
Go!

2:46:39.333 --> 2:46:41.335
Open it!

2:46:43.295 --> 2:46:44.379
Mom!

2:46:47.424 --> 2:46:48.425
Come on!

2:46:57.976 --> 2:46:58.977
Go, Tuk!

2:47:01.063 --> 2:47:02.064
There's no way out!

2:47:04.358 --> 2:47:05.442
Stay together,
okay?

2:47:05.609 --> 2:47:06.985
-Yes.
-Stay together.

2:47:07.152 --> 2:47:08.153
Yes.

2:47:37.099 --> 2:47:38.308
Oh, Great
Mother!

2:47:38.433 --> 2:47:39.810
Oh, Great
Mother, help us!

2:48:22.644 --> 2:48:23.645
Kiri!

2:48:44.208 --> 2:48:44.833
Bro!

2:48:45.792 --> 2:48:46.710
Mom and Dad...

2:48:46.835 --> 2:48:47.544
are down there.

2:48:47.669 --> 2:48:48.295
In the ship.

2:48:48.462 --> 2:48:49.505
Grab on.

2:48:50.297 --> 2:48:51.298
Bro, I'm
good. Go!

2:49:19.034 --> 2:49:20.035
Okay.

2:49:47.855 --> 2:49:48.856
Jake!

2:50:25.601 --> 2:50:26.268
Dad.

2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:32.441
Fuck!

2:50:47.206 --> 2:50:48.957
Come on, you son of a bitch!

2:50:49.166 --> 2:50:50.083
Dad, just breathe.

2:50:50.292 --> 2:50:51.126
Neteyam?

2:50:51.919 --> 2:50:52.920
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

2:50:54.338 --> 2:50:55.339
Oh, Lo'ak.

2:50:56.632 --> 2:50:57.633
I'm sorry, sir.

2:50:58.133 --> 2:50:59.843
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

2:51:00.052 --> 2:51:01.053
Just focus.

2:51:01.178 --> 2:51:02.262
Focus on now.

2:51:21.532 --> 2:51:22.658
We're losing
the air pocket.

2:51:22.824 --> 2:51:23.825
Come on.
We've gotta move.

2:51:23.992 --> 2:51:25.077
Come on, Dad.

2:51:32.793 --> 2:51:34.336
You know your way out?

2:51:34.753 --> 2:51:37.464
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

2:51:37.631 --> 2:51:39.174
I can't make it.

2:51:39.716 --> 2:51:41.093
You can. You can.

2:51:41.218 --> 2:51:41.844
No.

2:51:41.969 --> 2:51:43.011
So you gotta go right now.

2:51:43.512 --> 2:51:45.055
I can't lose you
too, Dad.

2:51:45.222 --> 2:51:45.889
Please.

2:51:50.394 --> 2:51:51.979
Mama,
I'm scared.

2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:54.481
It is all right.

2:51:55.315 --> 2:51:56.358
Stay close to me.

2:51:57.317 --> 2:51:58.360
Stay close to Mama.

2:52:00.946 --> 2:52:01.947
It's okay.

2:52:18.630 --> 2:52:20.465
You just have to
slow your heart down.

2:52:20.924 --> 2:52:22.092
Be real calm.

2:52:23.427 --> 2:52:24.678
Breathe
from here.

2:52:24.845 --> 2:52:26.430
Hey, breathe from here.

2:52:39.985 --> 2:52:41.320
The way of water has no...

2:52:41.445 --> 2:52:42.738
beginning and no end.

2:52:45.449 --> 2:52:47.492
The sea is around
you and in you.

2:52:49.119 --> 2:52:50.329
The sea is your home...

2:52:50.454 --> 2:52:52.789
before your birth
and after your death.

2:52:58.003 --> 2:53:00.881
The sea gives
and the sea takes.

2:53:02.132 --> 2:53:04.176
Water connects
all things.

2:53:06.345 --> 2:53:07.888
Life to death.

2:53:09.723 --> 2:53:12.017
Darkness to light.

2:53:35.290 --> 2:53:36.124
-Hi.
-Kiri!

2:53:36.291 --> 2:53:37.251
Kiri.

2:53:37.417 --> 2:53:39.419
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

2:53:39.753 --> 2:53:40.587
Mom...

2:53:40.712 --> 2:53:42.089
I'm gonna
give this to you.

2:53:47.135 --> 2:53:48.011
It'll help you.

2:53:49.596 --> 2:53:50.556
Dad, you can do this.

2:53:52.391 --> 2:53:53.600
Trust me.

2:53:54.226 --> 2:53:55.185
Calm your heart.

2:53:57.563 --> 2:53:58.564
Big breaths.

2:54:02.568 --> 2:54:03.569
Last breath.

2:54:08.615 --> 2:54:09.616
Follow me.

2:55:25.943 --> 2:55:27.194
Hold on.

2:55:27.319 --> 2:55:28.237
Just breathe.

2:55:28.904 --> 2:55:29.738
Just breathe.

2:55:34.326 --> 2:55:35.327
Thank you.

2:55:44.336 --> 2:55:45.838
I See you...

2:55:46.004 --> 2:55:46.797
son.

2:55:49.466 --> 2:55:50.300
MaJake!

2:55:51.718 --> 2:55:52.845
-Dad!
-Mom!

2:55:53.011 --> 2:55:54.221
Dad. Dad.

2:55:55.722 --> 2:55:56.390
Come on.

2:55:58.934 --> 2:56:00.102
Here.

2:56:06.441 --> 2:56:07.442
Brother.

2:56:16.869 --> 2:56:18.787
Sullys stick
together.

2:56:21.123 --> 2:56:22.666
It was our
greatest weakness...

2:56:24.042 --> 2:56:25.502
and our
great strength.

2:56:27.504 --> 2:56:29.256
Thank you, Great Mother.

2:56:29.965 --> 2:56:30.966
Thank you.

2:57:10.297 --> 2:57:11.298
Let's move out.

2:57:17.930 --> 2:57:18.931
Son.

2:57:21.183 --> 2:57:22.184
Come with me.

2:57:26.939 --> 2:57:27.940
Spider!

2:58:02.266 --> 2:58:03.183
Monkey Boy!

2:58:07.855 --> 2:58:09.064
Spider.

2:58:16.405 --> 2:58:17.573
-You all right?
-Yeah.

2:58:21.785 --> 2:58:22.786
Come here.

2:58:25.789 --> 2:58:27.958
A son for a son.

2:58:44.725 --> 2:58:46.977
Every songcord must have a last bead.

2:59:12.169 --> 2:59:14.004
A father protects.

2:59:15.339 --> 2:59:16.840
It's what gives him meaning.

2:59:45.202 --> 2:59:47.663
The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.

2:59:50.499 --> 2:59:52.376
And one day you
have to give it back.

3:00:06.223 --> 3:00:07.891
Eywa holds...

3:00:08.100 --> 3:00:09.518
all her children in her heart.

3:00:11.478 --> 3:00:12.771
Nothing is ever lost.

3:00:16.108 --> 3:00:17.109
Neteyam!

3:00:17.734 --> 3:00:18.944
Neteyam!

3:00:39.006 --> 3:00:40.257
My family and I...

3:00:41.383 --> 3:00:42.426
we'll move on tomorrow.

3:00:43.177 --> 3:00:44.303
Far away from here.

3:00:45.721 --> 3:00:47.431
Your son lies
with our ancestors.

3:00:48.724 --> 3:00:51.393
You are
Metkayina now.

3:00:57.107 --> 3:00:58.525
And there it was.

3:01:00.527 --> 3:01:01.945
We are Sea People now.

3:01:04.489 --> 3:01:06.408
This is our home.

3:02:06.969 --> 3:02:07.970
Dad!

3:02:08.846 --> 3:02:09.847
Look what
I caught!

3:02:10.639 --> 3:02:11.640
Wow.

3:02:12.933 --> 3:02:13.976
Oh, that's a big one.

3:02:14.643 --> 3:02:16.311
He was in that pool.

3:02:16.436 --> 3:02:17.062
By the rocks.

3:02:19.273 --> 3:02:20.524
Right where
you said.

3:02:24.403 --> 3:02:25.529
What is it, Dad?

3:02:27.072 --> 3:02:28.073
Why are
you crying?

3:02:30.367 --> 3:02:32.953
I'm just happy
to see you, boy.

3:02:34.580 --> 3:02:35.914
I'm happy to
see you, too.

3:02:38.667 --> 3:02:39.293
Here.

3:02:39.418 --> 3:02:40.169
You try.

3:02:42.671 --> 3:02:43.672
Okay.

3:02:45.424 --> 3:02:46.758
Leave any for me?

3:02:46.925 --> 3:02:47.926
Maybe.

3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:56.351
Yeah! Check that out. See?

3:03:03.984 --> 3:03:05.277
I see
now.

3:03:06.236 --> 3:03:08.238
I can't save my
family by running.

3:03:09.406 --> 3:03:10.449
This is
our home.

3:03:11.450 --> 3:03:13.035
This is
our fortress.

3:03:14.411 --> 3:03:16.496
This is where we
make our stand.
