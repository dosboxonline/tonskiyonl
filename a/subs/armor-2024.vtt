06:09.370 --> 06:13.469
I kept telling myself that
I didn't have a problem,

06:13.504 --> 06:16.700
but when I woke up
in my daughter's room

06:16.735 --> 06:19.334
with holes punched in her walls,

06:21.678 --> 06:24.009
that's when I finally
realized how deep I was.

06:25.281 --> 06:26.617
It didn't matter though.

06:27.686 --> 06:30.389
My wife already packed the car
two hours before I woke up.

06:37.123 --> 06:41.400
I don't even know where
they are anymore. (cries)

06:48.238 --> 06:51.035
- Thanks for sharing.

06:51.071 --> 06:54.842
I mean, that's what the
bottle does to us, right?

06:57.247 --> 06:58.549
It makes you a liar.

07:01.478 --> 07:06.249
You become your worst self and
worst version of ourselves.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.859
That's the hardest
part, I think,

07:14.232 --> 07:15.731
admitting what you've become.

07:17.669 --> 07:22.199
I know it took me a long,
long time to admit that.

07:23.302 --> 07:27.479
I know that if it wasn't for
this group and, and my, my son,

07:30.944 --> 07:32.580
I'd be at the bottom
of a glass somewhere.

07:32.615 --> 07:36.312
That's, that's without
question, so...

07:40.960 --> 07:43.825
(chairs rustling)

07:50.100 --> 07:51.762
- Hey, um...

07:51.797 --> 07:54.666
Sorry for losing it back there.

07:54.701 --> 07:55.938
Not a good first impression.

07:55.974 --> 07:57.306
- Please.

07:57.341 --> 07:59.506
My first meeting I was rocking

07:59.541 --> 08:01.271
in a fetal position for hours.

(truck horn beeping)

08:08.646 --> 08:09.521
That's me.

08:11.551 --> 08:13.285
Keep coming back.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.119
- Okay.

08:18.227 --> 08:20.697
(horn honks)

08:27.302 --> 08:28.301
- Come on.

08:28.337 --> 08:30.537
- Settle down.

08:30.572 --> 08:32.102
Just making sure you heard me.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.041
You know how old
people's hearing is, huh?

08:34.076 --> 08:37.041
- Well I'll tell you what,
maybe if you keep smarting off,

08:37.077 --> 08:38.847
the horn won't be the
only thing screaming.

08:38.882 --> 08:41.553
- Okay, settle down or you're
not getting your lunch.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.349
- Go, go, go.

08:44.385 --> 08:45.617
Let's go.

08:45.652 --> 08:48.956
(upbeat country music)

08:57.096 --> 09:00.138
So, uh, what's on
Sarah's menu today?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.564
- Peanut butter and pickles.

09:01.599 --> 09:02.998
- Ooh.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.509
How much longer you gonna
be able to stay on this diet?

09:05.544 --> 09:07.546
- Honestly, it's not
as bad as you think.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.542
- Yeah, it is.

09:10.577 --> 09:13.376
(engine rumbling)

09:17.687 --> 09:19.755
- Look, you can judge
me all you want,

09:19.791 --> 09:24.725
but all the books say that
the more we do together,

09:24.761 --> 09:27.021
the more it's like
we're both pregnant.

09:27.056 --> 09:29.167
- Ha!
- Which, it's

09:29.202 --> 09:30.602
it's a good thing, I think.

09:32.370 --> 09:33.902
Speaking of which, actually,

09:35.269 --> 09:37.906
Sarah said she didn't get
your RSVP for the baby shower.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.371
Sent them out a week ago.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.842
I, I told her they
probably got lost in the mail.

09:44.877 --> 09:48.411
So, did it get lost in the mail?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.448
- I don't know.

09:53.721 --> 09:56.254
- Dad, is everything okay?

09:58.062 --> 09:59.197
- Yeah.

09:59.232 --> 10:04.201
(upbeat country music continues)

10:04.236 --> 10:06.595
- No, I, I know, I know.

10:07.298 --> 10:09.366
I was thinking about
her last night too.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.941
- Sarah would go over baby names

10:14.412 --> 10:17.009
and this one's gonna be a boy,

10:17.045 --> 10:19.140
but she really wants the
next one to be a girl.

10:19.176 --> 10:22.918
So you throw out
the name Trisha,

10:24.347 --> 10:26.152
that's a possibility
down the line.

10:28.354 --> 10:32.587
And I dunno, I wasn't
sure how you'd take that.

10:35.665 --> 10:37.893
(woman laughs)
(ominous music)

10:37.929 --> 10:40.969
(suspenseful music)

10:42.173 --> 10:43.004
- Good name.

10:48.541 --> 10:49.439
- Yeah.

10:52.982 --> 10:57.185
Well, hey, six years
sober today, big guy. Huh?

10:57.220 --> 10:59.114
Come on.

10:59.149 --> 11:01.324
She'd be proud of you, Dad.

11:01.359 --> 11:04.828
(upbeat music continues)

11:19.913 --> 11:22.340
- 59326.

11:24.346 --> 11:25.211
- Yep.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.944
- 57291.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.613
(cases clattering)

11:36.653 --> 11:39.396
- You do know how long
your route is today, right?

11:39.431 --> 11:42.125
You guys are doing the dead 10

11:42.161 --> 11:44.560
and you're already
late. As always.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.307
Tell me, you really need to
review all this stuff again?

11:50.342 --> 11:52.138
- It's protocol, Frank.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.204
- Protocol is to get
this shit back in the truck

11:54.240 --> 11:56.638
so I can get back to
my clients, James.

12:01.783 --> 12:04.349
- In a better mood than usual.

12:05.288 --> 12:07.055
- 20248.

12:08.117 --> 12:11.092

12:13.967 --> 12:17.065
49826.

12:17.797 --> 12:18.693

12:27.213 --> 12:29.445
(metal rattling)

12:29.480 --> 12:30.672
- Pull that.
- Yeah.

12:42.153 --> 12:43.520
- Fucking hot box in here.

12:44.954 --> 12:45.863
Shit.

12:47.732 --> 12:49.592
It's not even noon
and it's this hot.

12:51.798 --> 12:52.903
This thing work?

12:55.165 --> 12:56.808

13:03.911 --> 13:05.448
The hell's that guy hauling?

13:05.483 --> 13:07.814
- It's not our business.

13:07.849 --> 13:10.283
- All right.
(cases thudding)

13:14.085 --> 13:15.456
I got it, I got it.

13:15.492 --> 13:17.087

13:17.122 --> 13:18.922
(case thuds)
- You okay?

13:18.957 --> 13:20.622
- [Casey] Oh fuck.

13:20.658 --> 13:21.629
- [James] You all right?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:21.664 --> 13:24.601
I dropped a fucking pen.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.565
Fuck.
- What do you mean a pen?

13:25.601 --> 13:27.565
- A pen light.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.841
Sarah gave me this light with
my name on it specifically

13:29.876 --> 13:32.503
'cause I'm always losing
shit in this fucking truck.

13:34.543 --> 13:35.838
- Let's go.

13:35.873 --> 13:37.105
Come on.

13:37.141 --> 13:40.251
- (groans) Fuck it.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.614
Fuck it, let's go.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.019
Okay, it's fine.

13:46.285 --> 13:50.153
- Look, I don't know
what's in there,

13:50.188 --> 13:51.519
but if we break it, we buy it.

13:51.554 --> 13:52.560
- I got it.
- You understand that?

13:52.595 --> 13:55.262
- Yeah, I got it.

13:55.298 --> 13:57.196
- Look, can you just don't
tell Sarah about this, okay

13:57.231 --> 13:59.304
'cause then she's gonna
start worrying about

13:59.339 --> 14:00.804
me losing my gun next

14:00.839 --> 14:03.641
and it's gonna turn
into a whole thing.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.876
- What, what is the
real issue here?

14:05.912 --> 14:08.170
- There's no issue, I just
don't want her to stress

14:08.205 --> 14:09.136
until the baby comes.

14:09.172 --> 14:10.548
- About a pen?

14:10.584 --> 14:12.273
- Yeah, it's gonna
stress her out.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.017
- Little words of wisdom.

14:14.052 --> 14:16.377
Your stress starts when
that baby pops its head out.

14:16.413 --> 14:18.956
You got that?
- Dad, please.

14:21.226 --> 14:23.685
- Fine.

14:23.721 --> 14:27.564
I will not tell Sarah
that you lost a pen light

14:27.599 --> 14:29.197
with your little initials on it.

14:32.669 --> 14:35.367
(door thuds)
- Yeah.

14:35.403 --> 14:37.904
Nothing more stress free
than driving a cash truck

14:37.939 --> 14:39.977
10 miles to
bumfuck nowhere.

14:41.747 --> 14:44.575
Beautiful, beautiful
bumfuck nowhere.

14:45.681 --> 14:48.480

15:26.258 --> 15:27.123
- Yeah.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.356
(truck rattling)

15:34.391 --> 15:37.263
- Fucking truck's falling apart.

15:37.298 --> 15:39.768
- It's got a little
bit of character to it.

15:39.803 --> 15:43.407
(upbeat rock music continues)

15:43.442 --> 15:45.273

16:06.793 --> 16:07.658
- Hey.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.432
Am I gonna have
to twist your arm

16:12.467 --> 16:14.236
or are you gonna finally
come over for dinner tonight?

16:16.802 --> 16:20.407
- I, uh, I have to host a
meeting tonight, I'm sorry.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.282
(light music)

16:26.317 --> 16:29.778
- You know you have an actual
family outside that circle?

16:29.813 --> 16:31.852
- Yeah, but not one
that's gonna drive a truck

16:31.887 --> 16:33.321
through the living room.

16:34.625 --> 16:35.620
- Not yet anyways.

16:37.821 --> 16:41.158
All right, look, the
offer still stands. Okay?

16:41.193 --> 16:42.966
Just come over whenever.

16:43.001 --> 16:46.330
Just thought it'd be
a good idea for you to

16:46.366 --> 16:48.671
get away from your
vices for a bit.

16:48.706 --> 16:50.835
(light music continues)

16:50.870 --> 16:51.768

16:59.179 --> 17:01.646

17:04.381 --> 17:07.784

17:47.460 --> 17:49.497
- Careful with the C4?
- Man, I, I know

17:49.532 --> 17:52.361
it's unstable as fuck, man.
- Well, everything's unstable.

17:52.396 --> 17:53.665
- Speak for yourself.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.610
(phone ringing)

18:06.817 --> 18:08.545

No, we're ready. Are
you fucking ready?

18:11.984 --> 18:12.882
Right.

18:14.086 --> 18:15.286
Let's do it.

18:15.321 --> 18:19.523
(heavy rock music continues)

18:19.558 --> 18:24.159
(crickets chirping)
(light music)

18:24.662 --> 18:26.297
- Hey, except that it's the
truth.

18:26.332 --> 18:27.572
- No, it's not. No it's not.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.833
- Uh, it's the truth.

18:29.469 --> 18:31.775
First day, little
Case on the job,

18:31.811 --> 18:34.811
a little baby in
his Kevlar vest.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.704
Got his baby, new little id,

18:36.740 --> 18:38.815
it's right off the
press still hot,

18:38.850 --> 18:40.551
carrying his first bag of money.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.118
Big bag of money.

18:42.154 --> 18:46.982
He's so nervous, he's, I
would say raining sweat.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.653
- He's exaggerating.
- You left a trail

18:49.689 --> 18:53.158
on the sidewalk, there's
no question about this.

18:53.194 --> 18:56.727
Anyway, back to the truth.

18:56.763 --> 19:01.172
All jittery, like, somebody
comes up beside him

19:01.207 --> 19:05.439
and taps him on the shoulder
just to ask the time.

19:05.475 --> 19:10.978
He whips around like Dirty
Harry right in the face

19:11.013 --> 19:12.913
of 147-year-old woman.

19:12.948 --> 19:14.081
- Okay, calm down.

19:14.116 --> 19:16.014
She was probably in her fifties.

19:16.049 --> 19:17.915
- Maybe 128.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.989
- And I'm regretting inviting
you to this dinner already.

19:21.024 --> 19:23.920
- Oh, ah. I'm glad you did.

19:25.127 --> 19:26.524
I needed a homecooked meal.

19:26.559 --> 19:28.122
- Yep, and I needed
a good laugh.

19:30.994 --> 19:35.932
Well, cheers to 30 days
on the job as a team.

19:37.334 --> 19:38.433
- Cheers.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.673
(glasses clinking)

19:44.146 --> 19:45.709
- So how was the route today?

19:45.744 --> 19:47.380
Any old lady try and
knock over the truck?

19:47.415 --> 19:50.612
- Okay, very funny,
baby. Thank you.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.152
No, no old ladies. No nothing.

19:53.188 --> 19:55.688
Just, just nice and quiet.

19:57.525 --> 19:59.494
- That's how me and
the little guy like it.

20:00.831 --> 20:02.395
- I, I don't know.

20:02.431 --> 20:05.133
I, I'd kill for some
action, honestly.

20:05.169 --> 20:08.501
I mean, just one
tweaker with a gun

20:08.537 --> 20:12.067
so I have an excuse to
pull my taser at least.

20:15.205 --> 20:20.218
- You are gonna find that
the best action is no action.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.880
Trust me on that.

20:27.353 --> 20:32.395
(light music continues)

20:45.939 --> 20:49.443
- Jeremy really let out the
waterworks this time, huh?

20:49.478 --> 20:50.838
- First week's the
hardest, you know that.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.708
- Yeah, you know
more than anyone.

20:53.743 --> 20:55.350
Hey, you hang in there, brother.

20:55.386 --> 20:57.246
Another year clear is
another year to stumble.

20:57.281 --> 20:58.080
- Right.

20:59.791 --> 21:00.687
Thanks, Pete.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.430
(engine rumbling)

21:14.437 --> 21:16.301
- Hey, looks like you're
moving slow today.

21:16.336 --> 21:18.070
Frank's gonna be pissed.

21:18.105 --> 21:19.533
- Always is.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.104
(light music)

21:23.473 --> 21:25.707
(door thuds)

21:25.742 --> 21:30.252
So what's on the menu today?

21:30.288 --> 21:32.580
- Turkey and fluff.
(engine rumbling)

21:32.615 --> 21:35.491
(light rock music)

21:57.211 --> 22:02.276
(muffled talking)

22:07.189 --> 22:08.919
- You're late again.

22:08.955 --> 22:10.488
I needed these things
outta here 10 minutes ago.

22:10.523 --> 22:12.256
- There was traffic, Frank.

22:12.291 --> 22:13.925
- I'll bet.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.661
Come on, Brody, I don't
have time for these excuses.

22:15.697 --> 22:17.792
I have a bank full of
people waiting for me.

22:17.827 --> 22:20.134
- Why are there four cases?

22:20.169 --> 22:21.935
Only says three here.

22:21.970 --> 22:22.769
- What?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.007
Why do you care?

22:26.043 --> 22:28.773
Just haul the stuff.

22:28.808 --> 22:30.679
- There are rules
and protocols, Frank,

22:30.714 --> 22:34.445
and this clipboard doesn't
say anything about this case.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.176
- The clipboard, yeah?

22:36.211 --> 22:37.815
What does it say about
me calling your boss

22:37.850 --> 22:39.156
and telling him you're
coming late to work

22:39.191 --> 22:42.292
because you're going
to AA meetings?

22:42.328 --> 22:43.455
Maybe he doesn't know
that you were kicked off

22:43.490 --> 22:45.394
the force for being a drunk.

22:45.429 --> 22:46.821
Listen, Brody, I hate
to break it to you,

22:46.856 --> 22:48.196
but you're not a cop anymore.

22:48.231 --> 22:50.461
You're a mailman with a gun.

22:50.496 --> 22:51.666
Just deliver the mail.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.638
(light music)

23:06.885 --> 23:08.485
(pen scratching)

23:17.422 --> 23:19.892
(case thuds)

23:22.462 --> 23:26.496
(upbeat country music)

23:26.531 --> 23:29.330
(engine rumbling)

23:37.312 --> 23:39.450
(upbeat music continues)

23:40.653 --> 23:41.551
- Dad?

23:42.714 --> 23:43.949
You're squeezing the wheel.

23:45.954 --> 23:49.521
- It's gonna be okay, we got
plenty of room back there.

23:49.556 --> 23:52.053
- Except people get arrested.

23:52.088 --> 23:53.458
We don't know what's
in those cases.

23:53.493 --> 23:56.456
It could be anything.

23:56.492 --> 23:57.694
Could be laundered money,
it could be unmarked bills,

23:57.729 --> 23:59.259
we could be fencing something.

23:59.295 --> 24:01.101
If it's not on the
ledger, we don't take it.

24:01.137 --> 24:02.599
It's my fault.

24:02.634 --> 24:04.470
It's my responsibility.

24:04.505 --> 24:06.140
Shoulda said no to that prick.

24:06.175 --> 24:08.974
(engine rumbling)

24:10.940 --> 24:14.482
- So, what you're saying is

24:14.517 --> 24:17.081
this might not be
a nice quiet ride.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.491
- Let's try to make it one.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.424
(birds chirping)
(engine rumbling)

24:26.460 --> 24:29.423
(suspenseful music)

24:43.005 --> 24:46.913
(suspenseful music continues)

24:49.282 --> 24:50.147
- Dad?

24:51.549 --> 24:52.446
Dad? Hey.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.452
Dad, what's going on?

24:55.488 --> 24:57.957
(tense music)

25:02.033 --> 25:04.931
(engine rumbling)

25:07.633 --> 25:11.003
(tense music continues)

25:15.707 --> 25:18.706
(wheels screeching)

25:18.742 --> 25:21.279
(car horn beeps)

25:21.315 --> 25:22.712
- Hold on.

25:22.747 --> 25:26.023
(tense music continues)

25:26.058 --> 25:28.691
(car thuds)
- Shit!

25:29.225 --> 25:32.154
What is going on?

25:32.189 --> 25:36.865
(engine rumbling)
(tense music continues)

25:37.435 --> 25:38.901
(tires screeching)
(car crashing)

25:38.936 --> 25:40.470
Fuck!

25:40.505 --> 25:45.136
(tires screeching)
(tense music continues)

25:47.875 --> 25:49.679
Man, where the hell
did they come from?

25:51.281 --> 25:52.674
- Case, call it in.

25:52.709 --> 25:55.044
Call it in.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.485
- Dispatch, this is
Casey to dispatch.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.388
We are getting robbed
on Lincoln Road

25:58.423 --> 26:00.649
and we need backup,
do you hear me?

26:00.684 --> 26:01.592
Do you copy?

26:03.591 --> 26:04.854
They're not fucking answering.

26:04.889 --> 26:06.293
- [James] Try another channel.

26:06.328 --> 26:08.758
(engine rumbling)

26:08.793 --> 26:10.568
(car crashes)
- Shit!

26:13.867 --> 26:17.201
(tires screeching)
(car horn beeps)

26:20.244 --> 26:23.614
(tense music continues)

26:24.575 --> 26:25.407
Fuck!

26:35.050 --> 26:37.223
(tense music continues)

26:37.259 --> 26:38.292
- Hold on.

26:38.327 --> 26:41.225
(tires screeching)

26:43.266 --> 26:46.265
(engines revving)

26:46.300 --> 26:47.198
- Fuck.

26:48.998 --> 26:52.401
(tense music continues)

27:00.076 --> 27:03.313
(tires continue screeching)

27:04.287 --> 27:06.921
(engines revving)

27:07.687 --> 27:10.719
(suspenseful music)

27:10.755 --> 27:11.921
(radio static)

27:11.956 --> 27:13.224
They're not fucking answering!

27:14.361 --> 27:16.027
- Hello.

27:16.062 --> 27:19.364
This is 432, this is
Brody, 247, we have...

27:19.399 --> 27:20.297
Hello?

27:22.069 --> 27:23.271
- [Case] What happened?
- We're being jammed,

27:23.307 --> 27:24.537
we're being jammed.

27:24.572 --> 27:27.975
(tense music continues)

27:30.072 --> 27:31.143
- He's on the right!

27:32.711 --> 27:37.787
(tires screeching)

27:39.852 --> 27:43.452
-It's closed!
(truck crashing)

27:44.988 --> 27:48.358
(tense music continues)

28:00.344 --> 28:03.714
(tense music continues)

28:09.688 --> 28:13.020
- [James]<i> What the</i>
<i> hell is this guy doing?</i>

28:16.052 --> 28:19.657
(suspenseful music)

28:19.692 --> 28:23.596
(tires screeching)

28:23.631 --> 28:26.935
(light dramatic music)

28:34.804 --> 28:35.713
- Dad?

28:38.449 --> 28:42.577
(light dramatic music continues)

28:48.490 --> 28:53.555
(engine rumbling)

28:56.995 --> 29:00.628
(dramatic music continues)

29:13.418 --> 29:17.814
(dramatic music continues)

29:17.849 --> 29:20.549
(tires screeching)

29:26.023 --> 29:29.327
(light dramatic music)

29:31.359 --> 29:34.401
(gun bangs)
(dramatic music)

29:34.437 --> 29:37.071
(guns popping)

29:47.812 --> 29:48.676
- Let's go!

29:50.114 --> 29:53.747
(dramatic music continues)

29:58.121 --> 30:01.858
(suspenseful music)

30:01.893 --> 30:05.466
(metal clattering)

30:05.501 --> 30:08.168
(explosion booms)

30:11.540 --> 30:14.273
(ominous music)

30:16.347 --> 30:19.305
(steam hissing)

30:19.341 --> 30:22.820
(ominous music continues)

30:25.686 --> 30:28.320
(James groans)

30:30.328 --> 30:33.493
(James coughs)

30:33.529 --> 30:34.832
- Are you okay?

30:37.533 --> 30:38.660
- Yeah, yeah.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.470
- Come on, come on.

30:43.506 --> 30:46.167
(James grunts)

30:46.202 --> 30:49.605
(both breathing heavily)

30:54.552 --> 30:57.019
- [Smoke]<i> Left door opening.</i>

30:58.556 --> 31:02.123
(ominous music continues)

31:11.931 --> 31:15.400
(James breathes heavily)

31:18.842 --> 31:20.836
(Casey gasps)
- [James] You all right?

31:20.871 --> 31:22.643
- Yeah.

31:22.679 --> 31:25.177
(ominous music continues)

31:25.213 --> 31:26.582
- [Smoke]<i> On top, on</i>
<i> top, they're armed!</i>

31:26.618 --> 31:31.581
(guns firing)
(dramatic music)

31:39.628 --> 31:41.430
- Listen to me.

31:41.466 --> 31:44.060
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:44.096 --> 31:46.835
Breathe, you can do this.

31:46.870 --> 31:50.440
Both do three shots,
tight grouping.

31:50.475 --> 31:51.406
You go low, I go high.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.838
(guns banging)

31:53.874 --> 31:55.511
Wait for the reload.

31:55.546 --> 31:59.206
(guns continue firing)

31:59.242 --> 32:02.118
(suspenseful music)

32:02.154 --> 32:03.077
Now!

32:03.113 --> 32:05.747
(guns firing)

32:13.124 --> 32:15.026
- I think I got him.

32:15.061 --> 32:19.229
(gun bangs)
(Casey groans)

32:19.265 --> 32:22.470
(suspenseful music)
(gun bangs)

32:22.506 --> 32:24.174
- Guys, Viper!

32:24.209 --> 32:25.231
Viper!

32:25.267 --> 32:26.474
Motherfucker!

32:26.510 --> 32:29.144
(guns firing)

32:31.746 --> 32:34.042
(Casey groans)

32:34.078 --> 32:35.282
- Motherfucker!

32:36.321 --> 32:39.288
(gun bangs)

32:39.323 --> 32:40.221
- Go!

32:48.928 --> 32:52.062
(both groaning)

32:52.097 --> 32:55.467
(guns continue firing)

33:03.547 --> 33:06.181
(Casey groans)

33:10.086 --> 33:13.782
(truck door thuds closed)
(ominous music)

33:17.396 --> 33:21.791
(Casey groans)

33:21.826 --> 33:23.363
- I feel like there's like
this fucking pulse in my leg.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.201
- Jesus, armor
piercing bullets

33:27.230 --> 33:29.006
(Casey groans)

33:29.041 --> 33:30.573
Hey, it went clean through,
it went clean through.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.039
Okay.
- Does that mean

33:32.074 --> 33:33.905
I'm gonna die?
- Not if you calm down,

33:34.675 --> 33:36.739
you're gonna slow your heart,
you're gonna slow your heart.

33:37.242 --> 33:39.172
Nice, deep breaths, ready?

33:39.207 --> 33:40.116
- Yeah.

33:41.816 --> 33:42.943
- Deep, even.

33:46.722 --> 33:48.349
(birds chirping)

33:48.384 --> 33:50.291
- [Smoke]<i> Motherfucker!</i>

33:52.356 --> 33:54.490
<i> You sold me on an easy pick.</i>

33:54.526 --> 33:56.263
- It was supposed
to be an easy pick.

33:56.299 --> 33:57.829
- Yeah, well, your easy
pick just fucking shot me.

33:57.865 --> 33:58.728
- You'll live.

34:00.528 --> 34:02.905
- Okay.
(Casey groans)

34:02.940 --> 34:04.637
- That fucking stings.
- Calm down.

34:04.673 --> 34:05.672
Pressure.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.035
Pressure, okay?

34:07.071 --> 34:07.869
Hold this.

34:09.240 --> 34:12.348
(suspenseful music)

34:12.383 --> 34:13.650
- Hawk!

34:13.685 --> 34:15.508
Viper and Hawk are down, man.

34:15.543 --> 34:17.514
- Shit.
- They're gone.

34:17.550 --> 34:20.182
These assholes locked
themselves in the truck.

34:20.217 --> 34:22.985
(metal clattering)

34:23.020 --> 34:23.819
- Fuck!

34:28.434 --> 34:31.068
(metal clangs)

34:34.702 --> 34:35.567
Breathe.

34:37.103 --> 34:38.900
Breathe.
- Fuck, fuck.

34:41.943 --> 34:43.036
What's that one for?

34:44.581 --> 34:45.445
- Breathe.

34:48.214 --> 34:50.917
That's it.
(Casey groans)

34:50.952 --> 34:52.685
Calm down, calm down.

34:52.721 --> 34:54.220
Calm down.

34:54.256 --> 34:55.415
- [Echo]<i> Blow the</i>
<i> fucking doors off.</i>

34:55.451 --> 34:56.557
- That won't happen.

34:56.593 --> 34:58.059
- Why not?

34:58.094 --> 34:59.888
Where's Match?
- All over the bridge.

35:01.093 --> 35:02.726
(Smoke grunts)

35:03.293 --> 35:05.861
(Casey groans)

35:12.072 --> 35:13.704
- Okay, okay, calm.

35:16.241 --> 35:19.380
Okay.
(Casey groans)

35:20.916 --> 35:22.579
(both breathing heavily)

35:22.614 --> 35:25.149
Just gotta hold till
they, till they come.

35:25.184 --> 35:26.814
Till they send backup.

35:26.849 --> 35:28.818
- How? We don't have
a radio or a phone.

35:30.859 --> 35:33.427
(tense music)

35:36.294 --> 35:38.296
- We got no service.

35:38.332 --> 35:40.098
- How? We're not
even that remote.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.730
- They're using jammers.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.407
Push down, push down.
(Casey groans)

35:44.442 --> 35:45.340
Okay.

35:47.041 --> 35:48.544
These guys are pros.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.148
(both panting)

35:53.011 --> 35:53.909
- Dad.

35:56.149 --> 35:57.946
What are we gonna do?

35:59.448 --> 36:00.751
- I don't know.

36:03.056 --> 36:04.194
I don't know.

36:08.228 --> 36:12.260
(foot thuds)
(tense music)

36:12.296 --> 36:13.599
- Anybody home?

36:19.243 --> 36:22.135
What we have here is a
Murphy's Law situation.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.716
You know what that is?

36:26.751 --> 36:30.044
(tense music continues)

36:36.593 --> 36:39.658
You're old enough to know what
Murphy's law is right, James?

36:40.930 --> 36:44.333
(tense music continues)

36:46.331 --> 36:47.963
- You know my name.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.899
- Research.

36:51.935 --> 36:55.575
Hey, Casey, sorry you
got pulled into this.

36:56.946 --> 37:00.349
(tense music continues)

37:03.547 --> 37:06.355
So, Murphy's Law is this:

37:08.049 --> 37:10.986
if something can go
wrong, it will go wrong.

37:12.622 --> 37:14.264
At the worst possible time.

37:16.362 --> 37:17.663
Like this fucking moment.

37:22.701 --> 37:24.831
- So I guess you didn't
plan on me sending

37:24.867 --> 37:27.343
two of your boys
up in smoke, huh?

37:28.943 --> 37:29.840
- Correct.

37:32.417 --> 37:35.252
- Hey, you know my name. What
am I supposed to call you?

37:42.157 --> 37:44.794
- So, now it's a chess match?

37:44.830 --> 37:46.186
- [James] Looks like that.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.302
- You can call me Rook.

37:55.168 --> 37:56.537
- More like Pawn.

37:58.602 --> 38:02.037
- Listen, don't waste time.

38:03.847 --> 38:04.809
Come out now.

38:06.346 --> 38:08.742
It's not your money, okay?

38:08.777 --> 38:11.385
Your kid is shot, he's got what?

38:11.420 --> 38:13.785
What do you got, Casey?
Maybe four hours?

38:15.286 --> 38:17.821
Be smart.

38:17.857 --> 38:21.224
You come out now and we'll
get you to a hospital,

38:21.260 --> 38:22.398
you got my word.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.161
Come on, be smart.

38:30.537 --> 38:35.004
- Look, don't bullshit
me, we both know

38:35.039 --> 38:38.414
you didn't do this plan to
keep two witnesses alive.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.977
And if you could blow
these doors open,

38:43.012 --> 38:45.014
you wouldn't be here
negotiating with me.

38:46.686 --> 38:50.327
My guess is Plan A
went up with your boys.

38:52.658 --> 38:56.696
- Bad choice.
(light dramatic music)

39:00.672 --> 39:01.536
Let's go.

39:03.205 --> 39:07.344
(light dramatic music continues)

39:12.146 --> 39:14.648
(tense music)

39:16.887 --> 39:19.053
(Casey sighs)

39:19.088 --> 39:22.190
- Was that guy right?

39:22.226 --> 39:23.888
- If we open the
doors, we're dead.

39:27.731 --> 39:29.458
- Okay.

39:29.494 --> 39:31.197
Yeah, you're right.

39:31.232 --> 39:32.226
I'll take the chance.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.230
He said he's been
following us, right?

39:37.700 --> 39:38.837
He's seen our ledger.

39:42.873 --> 39:45.805
We don't carry that
much this early.

39:45.841 --> 39:47.076
- This doesn't make sense.

39:49.584 --> 39:52.884
The armor piercing
rounds, cell jammers.

39:54.450 --> 39:58.395
Seven paramilitary
units fighting over
a hundred grand is...

40:06.035 --> 40:07.503
a 14 grand split.

40:09.731 --> 40:12.442
(case rustling)

40:15.870 --> 40:19.174
(light dramatic music)

40:40.672 --> 40:42.637
Shit.

40:49.111 --> 40:50.942
- What the fuck?

40:53.181 --> 40:54.583
- It's millions.

40:57.154 --> 40:59.549
That's a whole lot of gold.

40:59.584 --> 41:01.483
- Who does it belong to?

41:01.519 --> 41:03.452
(gold clinking)

41:03.488 --> 41:04.384
- It's millions.

41:09.801 --> 41:10.665
That signia?

41:15.664 --> 41:16.671
It's cartel.

41:18.306 --> 41:19.641
I saw that on the force.

41:22.012 --> 41:25.075
Okay, now we know.

41:28.546 --> 41:31.920
(air hissing)

41:31.956 --> 41:33.149
- What is that?

41:36.125 --> 41:38.924
(dramatic music)

41:41.461 --> 41:44.831
(air continues hissing)

41:56.342 --> 41:58.344
- Tear gas?

41:58.380 --> 42:01.815
(dramatic music continues)

42:03.383 --> 42:04.316
(both coughing)

42:04.351 --> 42:05.786
- Close your eyes.

42:08.893 --> 42:10.890
(door thuds)

42:12.888 --> 42:16.291
(air continues hissing)

42:18.232 --> 42:20.669
(Casey gags)

42:29.211 --> 42:31.911
(both coughing)

42:36.119 --> 42:37.684
- The case, Dad.

42:37.719 --> 42:39.413
Use the cases, us
the foam in the case.

42:40.782 --> 42:41.882
Hook it up.

42:41.917 --> 42:43.488
Plug up all the vents.

42:43.523 --> 42:46.893
(air continues hissing)

42:49.726 --> 42:52.426
(both groaning)

42:57.371 --> 43:00.071
(both coughing)

43:05.611 --> 43:08.374
- It's still coming in.

43:08.409 --> 43:10.449
- That rent-a-cop's some
tough son of a bitch

43:10.484 --> 43:11.852
to take that much gas.

43:14.818 --> 43:15.856
- We're outta foam, Dad.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.794
(both coughing)

43:27.236 --> 43:29.870
(Casey coughs)

43:31.066 --> 43:35.139
(light dramatic music continues)

43:52.954 --> 43:54.895
(case thudding)

43:56.100 --> 44:00.228
(both groaning)

44:00.264 --> 44:02.095
- Think there's a chance
that they just scorched

44:02.130 --> 44:03.431
their lungs and passed out.

44:05.166 --> 44:07.671
- Hey, Rook. That all you got?

44:07.706 --> 44:09.778
Stay calm. A little gas?

44:12.849 --> 44:14.642
- These fuckers must have
plugged up the holes.

44:14.677 --> 44:15.812
God...

44:15.847 --> 44:16.983
This is a fucking shitshow.

44:18.783 --> 44:20.819
(fist thuds)
Hey!

44:20.854 --> 44:24.589
James, you wanna
know what a steel can

44:24.625 --> 44:26.421
plus a bayou heat equals?

44:28.697 --> 44:32.931
Two wannabe cops
roasted by sundown!

44:32.966 --> 44:35.863
- [James] Oh, by the
way, I found the gold.

44:35.898 --> 44:37.333
- Son of a bitch.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.342
- Just wondering when
you try to fence that

44:48.377 --> 44:51.718
to some gang in Mexico,
what's gonna happen

44:51.753 --> 44:54.013
when they find out
that it's cartel?

44:54.048 --> 44:55.021
Think about that?

44:56.590 --> 45:00.353
- James, James, listen!

45:00.389 --> 45:03.327
You touch a coin in
that fucking case,

45:03.362 --> 45:06.230
and I promise you and your kid
are gonna go down real hard.

45:10.565 --> 45:13.506
- [James] Then I guess
you better move fast.

45:13.541 --> 45:16.713
(light dramatic music)

45:18.545 --> 45:20.115
- Get the drill.

45:20.151 --> 45:20.981
Get the drill!

45:21.878 --> 45:24.677
(dramatic music)

45:29.952 --> 45:32.993
(birds chirping)

45:44.474 --> 45:47.238
♪ Where we met be ♪

45:47.972 --> 45:50.674
♪ Water let the... ♪

45:50.710 --> 45:51.946
- Cut that shit out!

45:54.550 --> 45:56.075
- What is your problem, man?

45:56.110 --> 45:57.583
- Your voice, Tex.

45:57.618 --> 45:59.446
Keep it in your mouth.

45:59.481 --> 46:01.184
This goddamn world's
ugly enough as it is.

46:01.219 --> 46:02.687
- You could've made
me slip a wing nut,

46:02.722 --> 46:03.621
and then where'd we be?

46:03.656 --> 46:05.354
- How much longer?

46:05.390 --> 46:06.923
- Well, Mama always said
you can get it done faster

46:06.958 --> 46:08.063
or you can get it done right.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.555
- Yeah?

46:09.590 --> 46:10.695
Well, if you don't crack
that truck open soon

46:10.731 --> 46:11.592
I'm gonna crack you open.

46:12.929 --> 46:15.963
(tense music)

46:15.998 --> 46:17.202
Fucking shitshow.

46:18.571 --> 46:20.973
- Asshole.

46:21.009 --> 46:24.974
Just saying, I managed
to sing at the 44 Club.

46:25.009 --> 46:27.250
What do you listen to, Warrant?

46:27.285 --> 46:29.414
Fucking Marilyn Manson?

46:29.449 --> 46:31.619
Shit.

46:31.655 --> 46:33.383
- Yeah, the heat's
getting to him.

46:33.418 --> 46:35.324
Couple more hours out here
and he's gonna turn on us.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.155
- No, he'll be all right.

46:37.118 --> 46:38.889
- Bullshit, Rook.

46:38.924 --> 46:40.823
- He'll be all right, relax.

46:40.858 --> 46:42.497
- That's bullshit.

46:42.532 --> 46:44.128
He is this close to going postal

46:44.163 --> 46:46.732
because the last score
didn't go like this.

46:46.768 --> 46:49.002
You sold us on a
snatch and grab.

46:49.038 --> 46:51.473
Throw some fireworks at
the door, tase the drivers

46:51.508 --> 46:52.974
and then book it to Mexico.

46:55.306 --> 46:57.275
- You don't have the
stomach for this,

46:58.383 --> 47:00.311
then leave while you can.

47:03.045 --> 47:03.952
[Rook]<i> Let's go!</i>

47:06.048 --> 47:07.789
(Casey sighs)

47:07.825 --> 47:11.351
- Sarah would be pissed
if she saw this scar.

47:11.387 --> 47:12.592
I mean, they say
chicks dig scars,

47:12.628 --> 47:14.994
but this is fucking crazy.

47:15.029 --> 47:18.329
- Let's just get you
back to Sarah now, okay?

47:19.528 --> 47:21.530
We gotta clean that
out, it's festering.

47:24.306 --> 47:25.171
- Here.

47:26.168 --> 47:27.676
- No, it's an infection,

47:27.712 --> 47:29.538
we have to take care
of that infection.

47:32.043 --> 47:33.608
We're gonna need some alcohol.

47:35.719 --> 47:37.380
- I don't mean to
tempt you, Dad,

47:37.415 --> 47:39.119
but I would kill for
some moonshine right now.

47:41.084 --> 47:42.287
- What about vodka?

47:44.060 --> 47:46.521
- That would work too,
but I don't think there's

47:46.556 --> 47:48.461
gonna be any vodka in here.
- I got a thermos

47:48.497 --> 47:49.459
full of vodka.

47:54.932 --> 47:57.731
(birds chirping)

48:00.005 --> 48:01.201
- It's gonna be all right.

48:01.236 --> 48:02.340
Calm down, all right?

48:04.205 --> 48:05.079
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:07.450 --> 48:08.346
- [Smoke]<i> Sure</i> .

48:11.553 --> 48:12.713
- Fucking lunatic.

48:15.416 --> 48:18.994
(birds continue chirping)

48:22.392 --> 48:25.429
- Dad, you've been
drinking again.

48:29.300 --> 48:33.272
- I never, I never
really stopped.

48:35.740 --> 48:36.605
I...

48:39.143 --> 48:43.117
I tried, I, I did, I just...

48:46.153 --> 48:47.923
You know, I filled
that thermos every day,

48:47.959 --> 48:50.850
and I'd go tell addicts
to keep clean and I was...

48:52.930 --> 48:55.690
- All this time you've
just been lying to me?

48:57.635 --> 49:00.059
(James sighs)
(light music)

49:00.095 --> 49:02.466
- I tried.

49:02.501 --> 49:04.463
Your mother and I just, you,
you wouldn't understand.

49:04.498 --> 49:07.070
- Don't say that, don't say...

49:07.105 --> 49:08.637
I remember more than you know.

49:10.977 --> 49:16.051
(woman singing with guitar)

49:27.094 --> 49:31.594
(woman singing with guitar
continues)

49:34.935 --> 49:37.072
- This is so humiliating.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.605
- What?

49:39.640 --> 49:41.306
Kidding me?

49:41.342 --> 49:43.436
These people, they'd give
the right arm to be able

49:43.471 --> 49:45.146
to camp next to a gator's nest.

49:47.045 --> 49:48.484
Your left ankle.
- Oh.

49:48.519 --> 49:50.914
- Your elbow.
- Elbow.

49:50.950 --> 49:52.244
- [James] Your wife.

49:52.280 --> 49:56.320
- Hey! (laughs)

49:56.356 --> 49:59.627
Well, most people aren't
stuffed in a cop car.

49:59.662 --> 50:01.156
We look like criminals.

50:01.191 --> 50:03.194
- I think this is sweet.

50:03.230 --> 50:05.364
I think I'm riding
shotgun into a raid.

50:06.569 --> 50:07.828
- My man Case.

50:10.003 --> 50:12.002
See? Respects the old man's job.

50:12.038 --> 50:13.201
Somebody does in this car.

50:13.237 --> 50:14.635
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:14.670 --> 50:18.377
- Mother has a total
disrespect for the law.

50:22.811 --> 50:24.851
- [Trisha]<i> Oh, it's</i>
<i> dark as pitch out there.</i>

50:24.886 --> 50:26.851
- It is, there's no lights.

50:26.886 --> 50:29.685
(engine rumbling)

50:32.496 --> 50:34.855
(tires screeching)

50:36.400 --> 50:37.990
That maniac.

50:38.997 --> 50:40.327
- You're off duty.

50:40.363 --> 50:41.736
- They can kill somebody.

50:41.772 --> 50:43.968
- Dad, come on.
- Look at him.

50:44.004 --> 50:45.933
- Okay, you are off duty.

50:46.736 --> 50:48.677
- I gotta talk to him,
he's gotta slow down.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.847
(sirens wailing)
It's okay.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.473
- Babe.
- Two minutes, come on now.

50:54.509 --> 50:57.977
(sirens continue wailing)

51:01.052 --> 51:02.355
Hand me my gun?

51:03.758 --> 51:04.819
Please.
- No.

51:07.258 --> 51:09.021
(glove compartment thuds)

51:10.802 --> 51:14.163
Seriously?
- He can hurt somebody.

51:14.199 --> 51:17.667
(sirens continue wailing)

51:24.208 --> 51:26.275
(suspenseful music)

51:26.310 --> 51:30.009
All right, stay in the car.

51:35.723 --> 51:37.889
(door thuds)

51:37.925 --> 51:41.691
(suspenseful music)

51:45.626 --> 51:47.769
License and registration.

51:47.804 --> 51:49.600
- You don't look like a cop.

51:55.570 --> 51:58.272
- License and registration, kid.

51:58.308 --> 52:01.381
(crickets chirping)

52:04.253 --> 52:07.219
You're going 100 in a
50, you aware of that?

52:07.254 --> 52:08.456
- Yes sir. It
won't happen again.

52:08.491 --> 52:09.915
- Yeah?

52:09.950 --> 52:11.653
See, I was in a good
mood because I'm taking

52:11.689 --> 52:13.420
my family camping and
then I got in a bad mood

52:13.456 --> 52:15.423
when you rocketed past us.

52:15.459 --> 52:17.427
I wanna get in a
good mood again.

52:17.462 --> 52:20.830
So, Mr. Corey
Marshon, if I find out

52:20.865 --> 52:23.599
that you're going two miles
over the speed limit anywhere

52:23.634 --> 52:25.432
in this county, I'm
taking you to jail.

52:25.467 --> 52:27.072
Do you understand that?

52:27.107 --> 52:29.842
- Yes, sir.
- Slow down.

52:29.878 --> 52:32.841
(crickets chirping)

52:39.821 --> 52:42.686
(engine rumbling)

52:46.057 --> 52:48.527
(door thuds)

52:52.867 --> 52:53.994
We're on the move.

52:57.738 --> 52:59.632
What?

52:59.667 --> 53:01.074
- You said you wouldn't do this.

53:01.110 --> 53:02.971
- It was a little
stop, it's over.

53:03.006 --> 53:06.108
He was driving a hundred miles
an hour, he'd kill somebody.

53:06.144 --> 53:07.612
- Dad, really?

53:12.655 --> 53:13.519
- All right.

53:15.022 --> 53:18.154
No more cop, I promise.

53:18.190 --> 53:21.153
(crickets chirping)

53:23.566 --> 53:24.464
Sorry.

53:28.362 --> 53:29.862
Sorry.

53:29.897 --> 53:31.801
(truck horn blares)
(car crashing)

53:37.773 --> 53:41.413
(sirens wailing)
(muffled talking)

53:41.448 --> 53:43.817
- [Dispatch]<i> Yes,</i>
<i> engine five is arriving.</i>

53:43.853 --> 53:46.882
(suspenseful music)

53:49.753 --> 53:52.661
<i> Dispatch requesting</i>
<i> medvac at scene.</i>

53:53.097 --> 53:58.157
(sirens continue wailing)
(somber music)

54:11.276 --> 54:13.074
- Sir, are you okay?

54:13.110 --> 54:14.543
Sir?

54:14.579 --> 54:15.416
Guys, I need you
to come down here.

54:17.546 --> 54:20.113
Ma'am, can you hear me?

54:23.718 --> 54:27.692
(muffled police radio chatter)

54:29.097 --> 54:32.631
(sirens continue wailing)

54:33.804 --> 54:37.273
(somber music continues)

54:49.979 --> 54:51.281
-[Firefighter 2]<i> You go on the</i>
<i> other side.</i>

54:51.750 --> 54:53.481
-[Firefighter 1]<i> Ma'am, are you</i>
<i> all right</i> ?

54:53.516 --> 54:56.985
(somber music continues)

55:01.964 --> 55:05.158
(helicopter whirring)

55:11.467 --> 55:12.671
- I hated you.

55:14.372 --> 55:16.672
I wished it was you.

55:16.707 --> 55:18.944
I wished it was
you instead of her.

55:18.980 --> 55:20.349
I was so angry.

55:21.551 --> 55:24.012
I must've went through 15
pillows I punched 'em so hard.

55:26.021 --> 55:27.785
And we told you, Dad.

55:29.952 --> 55:33.019
We told you not to
stop, just keep driving,

55:33.054 --> 55:38.131
but you just had to
turn on those lights.

55:38.167 --> 55:39.764
Just had to turn
on those lights.

55:43.702 --> 55:45.803
But you didn't drive
that truck into Mom.

55:47.904 --> 55:51.279
And you need to stop
punishing yourself

55:51.314 --> 55:53.448
for something that you
had no control over.

55:55.182 --> 55:56.352
She wouldn't want that.

55:59.682 --> 56:05.285
I think it's just, it hurts,

56:05.320 --> 56:10.025
it hurts to admit she's gone
because of a stupid accident.

56:14.095 --> 56:17.497
- We gotta move and
we gotta this thermos.

56:17.533 --> 56:20.203
(tense music)

56:20.239 --> 56:22.972
(drill whirring)

56:28.545 --> 56:31.915
(tense music continues)

56:35.190 --> 56:40.562
(drill continues whirring)

56:40.597 --> 56:43.663
Just gotta find something we
can get through that latch.

56:46.102 --> 56:49.735
(drill continues whirring)

56:55.736 --> 56:58.370
(metal clinks)

57:05.087 --> 57:08.457
(tense music continues)

57:23.106 --> 57:26.739
(drill continues whirring)

57:38.284 --> 57:41.083
(metal clatters)

57:44.026 --> 57:46.088
(James grunts)

57:52.033 --> 57:53.297
Over there.

57:53.333 --> 57:54.896
No, turn your head.

57:54.931 --> 57:57.264
There's still gas
in that, get back.

58:01.936 --> 58:05.580
(drill continues whirring)

58:09.480 --> 58:12.279
(metal clinking)

58:13.649 --> 58:15.689
(metal clatters)

58:20.227 --> 58:21.123
-[Rook] Okay.

58:25.463 --> 58:26.667
Keep it going.

58:30.974 --> 58:33.773
(metal clinking)

58:48.156 --> 58:50.790
(James groans)

59:02.170 --> 59:04.969
- More. More.

59:08.374 --> 59:11.008
(Casey groans)

59:14.952 --> 59:17.586
(Casey grunts)

59:19.517 --> 59:21.051
- Okay, all right.

59:28.064 --> 59:30.192
(metal clattering)

59:32.466 --> 59:34.669
- That does not look good.

59:42.641 --> 59:46.274
(drill continues whirring)

59:51.113 --> 59:53.787
- [Smoke]<i> This is taking</i>
<i> forever.</i>

59:59.086 --> 01:00:01.553
- I don't think he's bluffing.

01:00:03.832 --> 01:00:06.393
Those doors look like
they're about to pop already.

01:00:08.997 --> 01:00:11.239
- How many bullets you got?

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.240
- Dropped my gun on the bridge,

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.139
all I got left is a bug zapper.

01:00:14.174 --> 01:00:15.204
Here.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.111
(drill continues whirring)

01:00:25.682 --> 01:00:28.217
(sparks zapping)

01:00:31.121 --> 01:00:32.860
- We can make these
tasers work I think,

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.456
then we cut it to two.

01:00:35.092 --> 01:00:37.463
- Yeah, yeah, just
two heavily armed pros

01:00:37.498 --> 01:00:39.060
with armor-piercing bullets.

01:00:39.429 --> 01:00:41.736
I'm sure our bare hands are
more than enough against that.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:43.971
What are you doing?

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.335
- Unless...
(light dramatic music)

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:53.946
We got a lighter and
some high-proof alcohol.

01:00:55.482 --> 01:00:57.316
Let's even the odds.

01:00:58.052 --> 01:01:01.685
- Dad, a Molotov in this tight
space, I mean, it's suicide.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.348
My leg's covered in that stuff.

01:01:03.384 --> 01:01:05.287
One little mistake
and we'll all go up.

01:01:08.826 --> 01:01:10.930
- Now let's get some air.

01:01:11.893 --> 01:01:14.461
(tense music)

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.672
Can you make it?

01:01:23.707 --> 01:01:25.309
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:25.344 --> 01:01:26.143
Come on.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.849
(Casey groans)

01:01:33.653 --> 01:01:35.647
- She's gonna crack any second!

01:01:36.887 --> 01:01:39.189
(drill continues whirring)

01:01:41.561 --> 01:01:44.964
(tense music continues)

01:01:52.905 --> 01:01:54.471
[Smoke] It's gonna crack any
second!

01:01:54.507 --> 01:01:56.043
- Stop! Stop!

01:01:56.078 --> 01:01:56.877
Please!

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.840
[Casey] Please stop, I can't
take this anymore!

01:02:00.876 --> 01:02:01.750
- [Rook] Cut it.

01:02:03.516 --> 01:02:04.412
What'd you say?

01:02:06.413 --> 01:02:07.855
- [Casey] I can't take it
anymore.

01:02:09.622 --> 01:02:11.925
I'll come out, okay?

01:02:12.525 --> 01:02:13.586
I'll come out.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.660
I need to get to a hospital.

01:02:18.095 --> 01:02:20.098
Just take me to a
hospital, please.

01:02:21.468 --> 01:02:23.431
(metal screeches)

01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:26.633
- [Smoke] The
kid's doing an act.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.668
- [Casey]<i> Please, stop.</i>

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:38.083
(suspenseful music)

01:02:42.283 --> 01:02:44.188
<i> Take me to a hospital, please.</i>

01:02:44.822 --> 01:02:46.454
- [Rook]<i> All right.</i>

01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:49.858
- What do we do?

01:02:49.894 --> 01:02:51.723
- The kid's doing an act.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.100
Don't you go soft
belly on me now.

01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.464
- This is not your
show, you get it?

01:02:57.637 --> 01:02:58.864
Are we clear on that?

01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:01.199
- You're gonna let
these two fuckers out?

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:02.801
Keep that shit going!

01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:03.738
Now!

01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:06.038
- Our time doubles
with a homicide,

01:03:06.441 --> 01:03:08.146
so we're gonna try
every chance we can.

01:03:10.517 --> 01:03:11.446
Work with me, man.

01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:17.485
(suspenseful music)

01:03:21.594 --> 01:03:23.626
Checkmate, James.

01:03:24.095 --> 01:03:25.730
There's only one
way outta this thing

01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:27.401
where you're still breathing.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:32.273
Hey Casey, three seconds
to open up the door.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.338
(suspenseful music)

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:38.638
One.

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:42.851
Two.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.250
Three!

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:53.994
Go get the C4 in the van, go on.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.791
(fire whooshes)
(Tex screams)

01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:03.366
(dramatic music)

01:04:06.237 --> 01:04:10.010
(Tex screams)
(dramatic music continues)

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:14.850
(taser zapping)
(Smoke groans)

01:04:23.889 --> 01:04:25.686
(gun bangs)
(James groans)

01:04:26.355 --> 01:04:28.490
- [James]<i> Holy fuck.</i>
(fire whooshing)

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:33.191
(light dramatic music)

01:04:33.226 --> 01:04:34.793
- [Casey] Come on!

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.468
(gun bangs)

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:50.182
- Don't miss your chance,
'cause it's closing.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:53.548
Closing fast.

01:04:58.924 --> 01:05:01.927
Come on, kid, don't be stupid.

01:05:01.963 --> 01:05:03.690
You can still walk
away with your life,

01:05:04.929 --> 01:05:06.264
you just gotta open up.

01:05:08.933 --> 01:05:10.070
- What about my dad?

01:05:12.806 --> 01:05:15.842
- He's already marked his grave,

01:05:15.877 --> 01:05:17.407
don't bring yourself
down with him.

01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:21.948
- You know, I'd
like to trust you,

01:05:21.983 --> 01:05:24.444
but let's face it,
besides everything else,

01:05:24.479 --> 01:05:27.081
you're all really
bad fucking liars.

01:05:27.117 --> 01:05:28.715
- Open the fucking hatch!

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.396
We're gonna get in there
one way or the other,

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.557
that I can promise you.

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:46.205
(ominous music)

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:50.869
(Smoke groans)

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:57.051
- Motherfuckers, you
fucking amateurs!

01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:01.583
(gun banging)

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.253
- Have you lost
your fucking mind!

01:06:07.288 --> 01:06:08.929
- These two are dead!

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.424
- If you keep firing
with that impact blast,

01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:12.297
you're gonna tear
through us first!

01:06:12.332 --> 01:06:15.295
- Yeah, you know, you
really are the motherfucker

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:17.297
of all jinxes, do you know that?

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:18.902
Who did the scouting?
- I did,

01:06:18.937 --> 01:06:20.765
you psychotic asshole.

01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:23.308
I'm the only reason you
know about this score!

01:06:23.343 --> 01:06:27.444
- Oh, yeah, and this job
has been a fucking disaster!

01:06:29.517 --> 01:06:30.950
(gun clicks)

01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:32.787
- Ask yourself
what you want more,

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.782
the money or a
bullet in your head.

01:06:38.058 --> 01:06:40.818
- Our demo guy's
all over the bridge,

01:06:40.853 --> 01:06:42.787
our driller's toast
and this little bitch

01:06:42.823 --> 01:06:45.099
won't even let me smoke
these two rent-a-cops.

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.198
You better come
up with something,

01:06:51.233 --> 01:06:53.206
you cocksucking bastard.

01:06:54.335 --> 01:06:56.108
- Is that a threat?

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:58.379
- How long have we
known each other, huh?

01:06:58.415 --> 01:06:59.311
A dozen years?

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.611
That's not a threat, my friend.

01:07:04.048 --> 01:07:05.218
Call it a forewarning.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.025
(Echo coughs)

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.457
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:15.094 --> 01:07:17.564
- Let's get this
thing over with.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.528
- This fucking guy.

01:07:20.437 --> 01:07:21.559
- Are you hit?

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.201
- [Casey] I don't think so.

01:07:23.236 --> 01:07:25.571
- Thank god that guy
can't shoot for shit.

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:27.541
(hand thuds)

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:28.802
- All good in there?

01:07:35.509 --> 01:07:37.184
Tensions are running high.

01:07:40.714 --> 01:07:42.585
You might say we're
at a stalemate.

01:07:43.524 --> 01:07:44.987
Agreed?

01:07:45.023 --> 01:07:46.160
- What do you want?

01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:49.427
- What do I want?

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:53.494
If I had guys like
you on my side,

01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:55.928
this job would've
been over hours ago.

01:07:57.597 --> 01:07:59.503
There's only one way out, Casey.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:02.836
Don't take too long.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.214
(light dramatic music)

01:08:10.784 --> 01:08:13.583
(birds chirping)

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:27.896
- It's getting hotter in here.

01:08:28.498 --> 01:08:31.271
We're gonna be cooking
in another hour.

01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:38.036
Drink it.

01:08:39.108 --> 01:08:40.812
- I'm fine.

01:08:40.847 --> 01:08:42.249
- I'm not asking.

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:44.746
Come on.

01:08:46.019 --> 01:08:47.884
(light dramatic music continues)

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.719
(water sloshing)

01:08:56.964 --> 01:08:58.991
Do you believe in miracles?

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:02.269
- No.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:05.503
There's good luck and
there's bad luck, that's it.

01:09:07.005 --> 01:09:08.473
- Finish it then.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.348
- Case.

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:19.616
Thank you.

01:09:22.352 --> 01:09:26.458
(light dramatic music continues)

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.474
(birds chirping)

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:49.514
(light dramatic music continues)

01:09:51.346 --> 01:09:54.145
(frogs croaking)

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.523
- Yeah, it'll cool off.

01:10:04.558 --> 01:10:07.365
- Radio's still silent.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.367
- How long do you think
it'll stay that way?

01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:11.630
- Well it's a
hail-fucking-Mary miracle

01:10:11.665 --> 01:10:13.208
we haven't been picked up yet.

01:10:14.402 --> 01:10:15.573
I say we move.

01:10:17.207 --> 01:10:19.044
- And do what?

01:10:19.079 --> 01:10:21.046
- Ram that truck off the bridge.

01:10:21.081 --> 01:10:21.978
- Yeah.
- Those doors will

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:24.151
bust open easy.

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.678
- Just lose the gold
in the river, yeah.

01:10:26.713 --> 01:10:28.685
- Depending on the depth, yeah.

01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:30.852
I mean, I can swim.

01:10:31.925 --> 01:10:33.756
Can you, Jinx?

01:10:33.792 --> 01:10:39.829
- Hey, they're gonna run out
of air soon enough, okay?

01:10:39.864 --> 01:10:44.864
- That old man would be dead
if you didn't pull your shot.

01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:46.604
Part of me thinks
you want him to live.

01:10:48.276 --> 01:10:50.938
- It's the last fucking
time with this guy.

01:10:53.607 --> 01:10:55.847
It's the last time.

01:10:55.883 --> 01:10:58.583
(birds chirping)

01:11:00.687 --> 01:11:03.214
- We never had problems like
this when it was just us.

01:11:04.557 --> 01:11:06.694
- We never went after
this much fucking money.

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:08.128
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.561
- We never lost
anyone before either.

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:18.273
I say we drop the whole lot,
take the gold for ourselves.

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:22.970
(light dramatic music)

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.287
- Can you move your toes?

01:11:35.186 --> 01:11:36.954
(Casey groans)

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:37.820
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:40.158 --> 01:11:41.054
- That's good.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:44.464
Case...

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.633
I'm sorry.

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.831
You were right.

01:11:52.867 --> 01:11:56.740
I haven't been
there for you and,

01:11:59.113 --> 01:12:00.744
I mean, I should have been.

01:12:03.351 --> 01:12:08.251
You were for me, and
you coulda cut out

01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:09.654
at any time, you didn't.

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:18.498
- What kind of dad would
I be if I did that?

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:20.995
Hey.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:28.266
If we do get outta here,
you gotta stick around,

01:12:30.804 --> 01:12:32.380
be a grandpa for a little bit.

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:39.178
I know these last six
years were a lie, but

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:44.821
I need these next six
months to be straight.

01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:48.825
Can you do that?

01:12:52.228 --> 01:12:53.126
- Yeah.

01:12:55.101 --> 01:12:55.997
I promise you.

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:07.309
- What the fuck is it gonna
take to break these two?

01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:08.640
- They will soon.

01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:10.577
- (chuckles) When?

01:13:10.613 --> 01:13:12.684
When the APB's out on us?

01:13:13.619 --> 01:13:16.085
Come on, let's waste
these assholes now.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.357
- Soon.

01:13:18.392 --> 01:13:19.652
- You really want
sirens on our ass

01:13:19.688 --> 01:13:21.361
to the border, don't you?

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:24.064
- You know, we could
find a different score

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:25.598
that doesn't involve murder.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:30.070
- You are a fucking piece
of work, you know that?

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.838
You're gonna back out now, hmm?

01:13:32.873 --> 01:13:34.404
And you.

01:13:34.439 --> 01:13:36.541
You, my friend, have lost it.

01:13:36.576 --> 01:13:40.044
- The plan was, and
is, they don't die.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.942
- After everything
that's happened.

01:13:41.977 --> 01:13:43.410
- I'm not bringing any
more fucking heat,

01:13:43.446 --> 01:13:44.884
what's with you?

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.684
You going crazy?

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:51.591
- I'm gonna get that
gold no matter what.

01:13:52.786 --> 01:13:55.859
(suspenseful music)

01:13:59.396 --> 01:14:01.134
(static buzzing)

01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:05.366
(gun bangs)
(dramatic music)

01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:06.364
- Now what?

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:11.605
(dramatic music continues)

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.547
- This is my show now.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:18.046
(suspenseful music)

01:14:20.449 --> 01:14:22.655
My way now.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.661
(suspenseful music)
(tires screeching)

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:31.092
(James grunts)

01:14:32.026 --> 01:14:37.098
(dramatic music)
(tires squealing)

01:14:44.204 --> 01:14:45.906
- [Casey] These guys
are fucking crazy.

01:14:45.942 --> 01:14:48.076
- They're gonna push
us off the bridge.

01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:53.986
(tense music)

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:56.755
(engine revving)

01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:00.293
Don't move.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:05.159
(engine revs)
(tires squealing)

01:15:10.369 --> 01:15:13.772
(tense music continues)

01:15:15.175 --> 01:15:18.209
(air hissing)

01:15:18.244 --> 01:15:21.043
(liquid dripping)

01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:30.954
(suspenseful music)

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:40.898
(Smoke yells)
(can clattering)

01:15:45.099 --> 01:15:51.077
(explosion booms)
(dramatic music)

01:15:51.112 --> 01:15:53.911
(water splashing)

01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:00.852
(Casey groans)

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:06.726
(somber music)

01:16:13.728 --> 01:16:16.604
(water splashing)

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:22.239
(somber music continues)

01:16:22.275 --> 01:16:24.909
(both grunting)

01:16:26.643 --> 01:16:29.113
(somber music continues)

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.947
- Hold on!

01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:34.017
(Casey groans)

01:16:39.427 --> 01:16:43.257
(water bubbling)
(ethereal music)

01:16:43.824 --> 01:16:46.733
(water splashing)

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:50.803
(James groans)

01:16:53.603 --> 01:16:56.935
(water splashing)

01:16:56.971 --> 01:17:00.607
(ethereal music continues)

01:17:00.643 --> 01:17:03.376
(both groaning)

01:17:08.519 --> 01:17:09.954
Stop, stop, stop!

01:17:11.117 --> 01:17:13.452
Listen to me, listen to me.

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:16.562
You did everything
you could, okay?

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.765
We're both gonna die
if you stay here.

01:17:19.198 --> 01:17:20.096
Just go.

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.159
Just go.

01:17:22.194 --> 01:17:23.132
We're both gonna die, just go.

01:17:24.502 --> 01:17:27.136
(Casey groans)

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:34.748
(James grunts)

01:17:36.283 --> 01:17:38.117
(water splashing)

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.813
Dad, I can't.

01:17:39.849 --> 01:17:41.986
I can't, just go, just go.

01:17:44.052 --> 01:17:49.125
(James grunting)
(Casey groans)

01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:57.705

01:18:39.711 --> 01:18:43.410
(emotional music continues)

01:18:45.713 --> 01:18:46.578
Dad.

01:18:50.689 --> 01:18:54.388
(emotional music continues)

01:18:58.365 --> 01:19:01.065

01:19:15.316 --> 01:19:17.950
(James grunts)

01:19:21.816 --> 01:19:22.713
- Come on.

01:19:23.984 --> 01:19:27.391
(both groaning)

01:19:27.427 --> 01:19:30.061
(both panting)

01:19:34.969 --> 01:19:38.238
Let me catch my breath,
and then I'll get you home.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:39.730
I'll get you home.

01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:43.774
I'll get you home.

01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:44.903

01:20:50.871 --> 01:20:51.871
Come on.

(light country music continues)

01:21:16.328 --> 01:21:18.165
Lean on it for a sec.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.567
Sit down.
- You're survivors.

01:21:26.242 --> 01:21:27.805
- What are you
gonna do now, huh?

01:21:29.682 --> 01:21:30.808
What are you gonna do?

01:21:32.245 --> 01:21:33.250
- I'm not a killer.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.846
Not in my nature.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.885
I'm done.

01:21:39.921 --> 01:21:40.719
I'm done.

01:21:43.795 --> 01:21:44.998
- What does that mean?

01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:49.167
- It means what it means, James.

01:21:51.803 --> 01:21:52.940
- What are you asking?

01:21:55.770 --> 01:22:01.608
- When those cops show up in
a minute, I was never here.

01:22:03.851 --> 01:22:05.744
- You're aware I
was a cop, right?

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.088
- Ain't nobody's perfect.

01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:15.462
- You all right with that, Case?

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:18.889

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.452
- Drive.
(engine rumbling)

01:23:14.488 --> 01:23:15.352
- Come on.

01:23:17.053 --> 01:23:20.357
(blues music continues)

01:23:24.664 --> 01:23:27.001
(sirens wailing)

01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:46.449
