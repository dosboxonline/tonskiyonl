14:54.000 --> 14:55.332
I saw one.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.790
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

14:57.791 --> 15:00.291
Can't hurt to look, can it?

15:06.875 --> 15:09.875
[rock music playing over speaker]

15:14.833 --> 15:16.499
You could have warned me.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.040
Fat chance. About what?

15:19.041 --> 15:20.832
Your stunt at the checkpoint.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.750
No idea what you're babbling about.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.625
That wasn't you?

15:25.750 --> 15:26.583
Hmm.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.083
Hmm.

15:29.916 --> 15:31.290
Well, however it happened,

15:31.291 --> 15:34.291
the whole undercity's buzzing,
saying you're back.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.082
- So I'm thinking--
- Not your strong suit.

15:37.083 --> 15:40.165
Would make a world of difference
if you showed up.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.082
[Jinx sighs]

15:41.083 --> 15:42.415
You're a symbol.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.166
Ha. You want a symbol?

15:46.208 --> 15:47.041
[grunts]

15:47.833 --> 15:52.874
[scoffs] Silco spent his whole life
trying to rally the undercity together.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.790
Stupid joke that it is,

15:54.791 --> 15:57.250
you have the chance to pull it off.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.374
I told you, I'm not interested.

16:01.375 --> 16:05.165
[grunts] Do you know how much
he sacrificed to protect you?

16:05.166 --> 16:06.665
He believed in your potential.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.583
[Jinx] Well, then he shouldn't have died!

16:10.708 --> 16:13.582
[sighs] We're having a rally tonight.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.915
Vander's statue.

16:14.916 --> 16:17.415
Firelights, your fans...

16:17.416 --> 16:20.040
Anyone I can bring to the table.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.165
Stick your head in the dirt if you want,

16:22.166 --> 16:25.749
but this fantasy
you've been living out here,

16:25.750 --> 16:27.916
it's not gonna last forever.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.208
Don't trip on the way out.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.625
[scoffs] I don't know how you do it, kid.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.458
I gotta go bother someone.

16:50.291 --> 16:52.290
[wood creaking]

16:52.291 --> 16:55.249
[brooding music playing]

16:55.250 --> 16:57.833
Still giving me the silent treatment, huh?

16:59.333 --> 17:01.124
Between you and Isha,

17:01.125 --> 17:03.375
I'm losing my snappy comebacks.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.625
Me, a hero. [scoffs]

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375
How screwed up is this place?

17:15.541 --> 17:17.207
I know Sevika's right,

17:17.208 --> 17:20.125
and I probably owe it to you,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.540
on account of the murdering and all.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.833
But I got something going now.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.415
A friend.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.208
And I don't want to mess it up.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.500
Maybe that's what I was like for you.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.999
If you care so much about me
playing your stupid revolution game,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.750
speak up now, or I guess...

17:50.708 --> 17:51.875
I guess you...

17:53.250 --> 17:54.500
You're really gone.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.708
And there's no reason
to stay here anymore.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.958
[melancholy music playing]

19:10.750 --> 19:11.916
[murmurs] Statue...

19:25.666 --> 19:28.250
Vander's statue...

19:49.291 --> 19:51.500
[Sevika] <i>It's no secret we got history.</i>

19:52.708 --> 19:54.833
<i>Blood spilt on all sides.</i>

19:55.541 --> 19:57.916
<i>But we grew up on the same streets.</i>

19:58.791 --> 20:00.833
Ate the same scraps.

20:01.708 --> 20:04.874
Like it or not,
we're in this mess together.

20:04.875 --> 20:07.540
Enforcers raiding our homes.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.040
Noxians down our throats.

20:10.041 --> 20:13.249
Innocents getting carted off
to Stillwater.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.332
[crowd murmuring]

20:14.333 --> 20:18.665
We gotta choose right now
whether we're gonna throw in the towel

20:18.666 --> 20:20.750
or make a stand together.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.040
Not as Firelights

20:23.041 --> 20:24.624
or Jinxers

20:24.625 --> 20:26.499
or washed-up goons.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.540
- As Zaunites.
- [man 1] We wanna see Jinx!

20:28.541 --> 20:30.040
[man 2] Where is Jinx?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.540
[crowd clamoring]

20:31.541 --> 20:32.665
Where is she?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.415
[man 1] We wanna see Jinx!

20:34.416 --> 20:35.665
Yeah, where is she?

20:35.666 --> 20:37.708
[woman] Yeah, where's Jinx?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.458
[stirring music playing]

20:58.041 --> 20:59.583
[crowd clamoring]

21:07.666 --> 21:10.208
[crowd cheering]

21:17.583 --> 21:19.290
You're all under arrest.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.625
[crowd shouting]

21:24.708 --> 21:26.708
[music turns dramatic]

21:58.541 --> 22:00.874
- [Enforcer 1] Drop the blade.
- [Enforcer 2] Drop it.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.832
[Enforcer 1] Drop the blade.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.708
[music turns suspenseful]

22:23.208 --> 22:25.208
[growling]

22:34.416 --> 22:37.415
[opera music playing faintly over speaker]

22:37.416 --> 22:38.583
[Jinx] I'm back.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.791
Time to find out
who's the new pebbleweight--

22:42.541 --> 22:44.500
Hmm? Isha?

22:46.416 --> 22:49.207
Okay, I get it.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.041
We're playing that game, are we?

22:57.750 --> 22:58.625
Isha?

22:59.208 --> 23:00.999
[Sevika] They got her. [groans]

23:01.000 --> 23:02.207
What?

23:02.208 --> 23:03.791
She came to the rally.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.124
Topside raided the place.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.958
Took everyone.

23:10.458 --> 23:11.707
[Jinx] <i>You know what you are.</i>

23:11.708 --> 23:14.165
- [Vi] <i>Damn it, Powder!</i>
- Shut up. Shut up.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.625
Shut up. Shut up.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.750
[Jinx] <i>Stop calling me that.</i>

23:20.375 --> 23:22.374
[Silco] <i>Her name is Jinx.</i>

23:22.375 --> 23:23.666
[Vi] <i>She's my sister.</i>

23:24.541 --> 23:27.207
- [Silco] <i>Jinx.</i>
- [voices] <i>You have to be someone else.</i>

23:27.208 --> 23:28.333
<i>Jinx.</i>

23:29.291 --> 23:31.291
<i>Jinx.</i>

23:31.791 --> 23:33.791
[gasping]

23:36.666 --> 23:39.415
[wheels rattling]

23:39.416 --> 23:41.500
[grim music playing]

23:55.750 --> 23:57.291
Chin up, little one.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.625
I'll tell you a secret.

24:00.791 --> 24:02.416
We won't be staying long.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.000
- [growling]
- [heart thumping]

24:38.708 --> 24:41.957
Don't suppose you can swim, huh, Lefty?

24:41.958 --> 24:43.082
[sighs]

24:43.083 --> 24:46.125
Well, only leaves the fun option.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.541
I'm gonna hate this, aren't I?

24:50.875 --> 24:53.875
[suspenseful rock music playing]

25:02.375 --> 25:03.832
Ha! It's me.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.207
Your vile villainess.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.290
The author of your nightmares.

25:07.291 --> 25:08.874
The, uh, dread of your--

25:08.875 --> 25:10.333
[Enforcer] Who are you?

25:10.916 --> 25:12.083
[sighs]

25:12.875 --> 25:14.665
Mm, Jinx?

25:14.666 --> 25:17.707
[Enforcer scoffs]
Yeah, never heard that before.

25:17.708 --> 25:20.082
You're not gonna haul me in?

25:20.083 --> 25:22.124
Claim the prize? Be the big hero?

25:22.125 --> 25:25.915
[Enforcer] You expect me to believe Jinx,
the master criminal,

25:25.916 --> 25:27.375
wears pants like that?

25:28.291 --> 25:29.790
What's wrong with my pants?

25:29.791 --> 25:32.833
[Enforcer] You look like
a half-eaten circus tent. [groans]

25:34.750 --> 25:37.000
Ugh! I am Jinx.

25:53.041 --> 25:54.625
[Jinx scoffs] "Half-eaten."

25:55.916 --> 25:57.333
[Sevika] Can we focus?

26:06.250 --> 26:09.291
[Jinx] Oh... Oh, oh, oh...

26:13.708 --> 26:14.541
[Enforcer] Let's go.

26:15.583 --> 26:17.999
Whoo! Big mama.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.540
How'd you take her in?

26:19.541 --> 26:23.375
[Jinx] I gave her a choice between this
and a swim in the harbor.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.416
- [warden chuckles]
- [Jinx chuckles]

27:02.750 --> 27:04.708
Cell Block C. Carry on, officer.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.915
[Jinx] Yes, sir.

27:07.916 --> 27:09.000
Move it.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.791
[bones crack]

27:32.541 --> 27:33.415
[snickers]

27:33.416 --> 27:35.541
[suspenseful music playing]

27:42.833 --> 27:44.500
[Enforcer speaks indistinctly]

28:01.625 --> 28:02.791
[Jinx snickers]

28:06.083 --> 28:07.875
[woman 1] Come on, man. I have a kid.

28:08.416 --> 28:09.958
[woman 2] You can't keep us in here.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.582
[Jinx] Here I am,

28:44.583 --> 28:46.875
your big fat hero.

28:53.208 --> 28:55.208
[tense music playing]

29:24.625 --> 29:26.625
[music turns stirring]

29:53.958 --> 29:55.958

[snarls]

31:01.916 --> 31:03.916
[grunting]

31:12.875 --> 31:15.833
You're late for
Stink Maw's great comeuppance.

31:17.291 --> 31:18.208
[Jinx grunts]

31:24.000 --> 31:25.332
[sobbing]

31:25.333 --> 31:28.041

[gate opens]

31:56.083 --> 31:57.541
[doors thump]

32:08.708 --> 32:10.333
What the hell was that?

32:11.250 --> 32:12.083
[Enforcer] Move it.

32:17.916 --> 32:18.875
Stand down.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.625
[Enforcers shouting]

32:49.125 --> 32:50.333
[gasps]

[roars]

33:14.333 --> 33:15.541
[roars]

33:20.000 --> 33:21.041
Get her out.

33:25.833 --> 33:26.707
You really are a--

33:26.708 --> 33:28.958
Big fat hero.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
[screams]

34:33.833 --> 34:35.916
[yells]

34:54.166 --> 34:56.458
You got me, hairball.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.500
But just remember...

35:00.708 --> 35:02.416
you're no Stink Maw.

35:03.875 --> 35:04.916
Smile.

35:06.291 --> 35:08.250
