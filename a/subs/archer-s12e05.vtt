WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.879
[Malory] Burning down a warehouse?

00:06.214 --> 00:08.842
Sinking a super yacht?

00:09.509 --> 00:12.846
Crashing a school bus
through another school bus?

00:12.929 --> 00:15.515
Oh! X marks the tragedy.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.226
Uh, empty school buses, for the record.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.353
But wow, very full of gas.

00:20.437 --> 00:24.023
I think the phrase you're all looking for
is "mission accomplished."

00:24.107 --> 00:25.734
The phrase I'm looking for

00:25.817 --> 00:29.487
would fill my swear jar
to the fucking brim.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.031
Damn it.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.700
And why do you insist
on shooting every vat you see?

00:33.783 --> 00:37.746
Because shooting vats is spycraft 101.
Also, I didn't know the vat would explode.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.790
-I was banking on some sort of acid.
-I didn't know boats could burn.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.459
Aren't they, like, super-wet?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.961
On the bright side, destroying the lab

00:45.044 --> 00:48.923
means it'll no longer pollute the harbor
and kill endangered harbor seals.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.384
See, Mother, the explosion
was good for seals.

00:51.468 --> 00:55.513
Maybe the seals understand
the concept of collateral damage

00:55.597 --> 00:57.348
that I have to pay for!

00:57.432 --> 00:58.933
Seems abstract for a pinniped.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.562
Look, the important thing is that we got
the microchips, which means that--

01:02.645 --> 01:04.731
Wait. You don't know
what the microchips were for?

01:04.814 --> 01:07.484
I don't keep track
of every microchip we recover!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.152
And… missile guidance.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.738
-She guessed.
-Okay, fine. What were they for?

01:11.821 --> 01:14.032
-Why would I know?
-I assumed chemical weapons.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.409
I got more of a spy satellite vibe.

01:16.493 --> 01:20.371
Hmm, I got more of a "you got beat up
by a mob boss's preteen son" vibe.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.999
-I couldn't punch a ten-year-old!
-Or block his punches.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.419
Jesus, are all debriefs this negative?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.671
-I mean, yes?
-[all] Yeah.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.256
Come on. You're heroes.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.675
You took down a secret lab.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.930
-Uh, yeah, there's always a secret lab.
-And they're never very secret.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.641
I'd never been there,
and I knew where the bathroom would be.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.768
Take your ennui outside,

01:41.851 --> 01:45.063
and do whatever you do with it.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.652
-Are we boring now?
-I mean, Cyril always was.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.072
-[sighs] Fair.
-And Lana got boring once she got married.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.825
-Excuse me?
-Oh, and her hearing is starting to go.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.035
Boring? You're spies.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.703
You're just overworked.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.749
Hey, when was the last time
you all went out for drinks?

02:04.833 --> 02:08.044
Uh, I'm guessing drinking alone outside
doesn't count.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.755
Think she means as a group.
And it has been a while.

02:10.839 --> 02:13.633
-Huh. That might be a nice change of pace.
-That's a great idea.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.177
There's this new bar called
I Don't Want to Go Home.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.471
It's right next to
My Marriage Was a Mistake

02:18.555 --> 02:20.807
and down the street
from Fun Cool Single Life,

02:20.890 --> 02:23.810
-but that place closed down.
-Probably because of the bad name.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.563
Come to think of it,
we haven't gone out since Archer was--

02:26.646 --> 02:28.898
On sabbatical,
because that's what it's called.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.901
My nephew is in
a medically induced sabbatical.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.487
I got plans later,
but I'm down to rage before my rage.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.532
-Great! First round's on me.
-[Krieger] Hold that thought!

02:39.450 --> 02:41.411
-No.
-Aw.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.164
-Next stop, memories we can't remember!
-[elevator bell dings]

02:44.247 --> 02:47.876
[all chanting] Spies! Spies! Spies!

02:53.089 --> 02:54.966
Oh, God, who are we?

03:34.422 --> 03:37.175
Ugh. Maybe this work hang
would be better if we--

03:37.258 --> 03:38.551
Split up? Absolutely.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.928
-I'll be at the bar.
-Darts.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.346
-[Archer] Women.
-I got alley.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.390
Sort of defeats the purpose
of a work hang, and they're gone.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.517
-I'm still here.
-Uh-huh.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.481
-Stop doing that.
-I'm just trying to feel something.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.776
This group-slash-night is so lame.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.237
[gasps] We should get matching tattoos!

03:57.320 --> 03:58.488
In matching places!

03:58.571 --> 04:01.658
-Eh. I've done worse for less.
-If you really want to liven things up,

04:01.741 --> 04:03.910
we should all take
my new experimental psychedelic.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.994
What does it do?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.914
Not sure yet, but the rats
seemed to like it before they died.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.166
No? Your loss.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.878
[Archer] There he is. Cyril!

04:13.962 --> 04:15.380
Hey, come meet my friends.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.049
-Oh, my God, your eye.
-Oh. This?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.550
Yeah, that. That's from--

04:19.634 --> 04:22.553
It's from a little boy punching me
while I tried to tie him up.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.391
-What the hell was that?
-What?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.226
You can't just say the humiliating thing.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.145
You're supposed to change the subject.
Then I don't let you.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.356
Then you try to explain,
but it doesn't work.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.858
It's no fun if you admit
you're a loser right away.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.361
What can I say? Maybe I am a loser.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.197
Yeah, you are a loser.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.615
Damn it, I feel nothing.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.368
Maybe feel a little compassion
for the man you destroyed?

04:45.451 --> 04:48.955
Charles Van Doren? He betrayed
America's trust in quiz shows, Pam.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.582
I mean Cyril. You broke him, dude.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.501
How is Cyril being lame my fault?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.586
Because he was happy and good at his job

04:55.670 --> 04:57.171
and insanely ripped,

04:57.255 --> 05:00.216
and then you woke up
and started insulting him and now--

05:00.300 --> 05:01.801
-[grunts] Guys.
-Come on, man.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.803
Guys, I already agreed to buy you drinks!

05:03.886 --> 05:05.847
-Buy us a drink.
-Shoving me solves nothing.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.266
So yeah, pretty explicitly your fault.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.102
[laughing] Oh, my-- That's hilarious.

05:12.186 --> 05:15.064
Oh, my God. Did you see that?
He just walked away from me.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.191
Whoa. Take it easy, married lady.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.694
Ugh. You sound like my husband,

05:19.777 --> 05:23.781
who I love and will text to join us
right this minute.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.533
Lana, I was kidding.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.869
Is this about Archer calling you boring?

05:27.952 --> 05:29.704
No, it's just-- What if he's right?

05:29.787 --> 05:33.499
Sandra, a man walked away from me.
That has literally never happened before!

05:33.583 --> 05:35.626
Hey, can I get a couple light beers?

05:35.710 --> 05:38.463
-You can, but you won't.
-Hey! Not cool, Pam.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.797
Put it on her tab.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.134
This rager's on fumes,
and we gotta refill the tank.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.635
The booze tank.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.471
Ugh. Mescal and Schützie?

05:46.554 --> 05:47.972
Do those even go together?

05:48.056 --> 05:51.601
Time to find out! Prosit, <i>chicas</i>!

05:51.684 --> 05:54.520
Cheryl, I'm gonna say something
and you're probably gonna laugh.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.022
Don't tell me what to do!

05:56.105 --> 05:57.106
But fun.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.693
Pam thinks I ruined Cyril when I woke up.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.236
-Why aren't you laughing?
-Hmm.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.198
-Wait. Do you think I ruined Cyril too?
-Eh…

06:05.281 --> 06:06.574
-Cheryl!
-No?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.159
-Good.
-Not just Cyril.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.869
-What?
-Cyril was first.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.413
But when he got bad at missions,
it put pressure on Lana,

06:12.497 --> 06:14.957
which led to her marital problems,
which made Pam gossipy,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.043
which made me start stealing again.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.294
These aren't my shoes.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.963
Well, excuse me for waking up from a coma!

06:21.047 --> 06:24.175
Are we not saying sabbatical anymore?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.178
[man] Yeah, I ain't said nothing.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.639
I didn't run away.
The guy with the cane gassed me.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.891
Yeah, yeah, with magical cane gas.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.269
-Do you know how stupid you sound?
-Can we go to the hospital now?

06:35.353 --> 06:39.148
No! We wait for them to leave
and see how they like to be ambushed.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.151
I don't think they'd take
the microchips to a shitty bar.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.986
This is about self-respect, man.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.281
The boss can get new microchips
for whatever they were for.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.283
Pretty sure it's super soldiers.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.535
[retching]

06:51.828 --> 06:55.039
Robert, good. Question:
Has me being out of a coma made Lana

06:55.123 --> 06:56.165
A, better,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.625
B, slightly better,

06:57.708 --> 06:59.418
or C, basically the same?

06:59.502 --> 07:01.170
I guess she's been more distant.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.215
Not one of the options, Robert!
What are you even doing here?

07:04.298 --> 07:05.800
Lana invited me to join you.

07:05.883 --> 07:09.053
Yeah, she seems
super-invested in that invite.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.888
I love your hands.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.557
Wow, she is really--

07:12.640 --> 07:17.186
They're almost as big as mine.
I mean the same size as mine.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.063
We're hand twins.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.815
Ugh. Out of practice.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.526
Hey, was Lana aggressively
flirting with other men

07:23.609 --> 07:26.404
-before I woke up from my coma?
-No, that's pretty new.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.489
Damn it. Also, sorry.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.907
I wouldn't read into that.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.201
Oh, my God-- [laughing]

07:32.285 --> 07:34.412
-Or that.
-You know what? I trust her.

07:34.495 --> 07:38.124
Make sure everyone has a good time.
I'll text Lana I couldn't make it.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.752
Wait, one more question. Did you also
lie to her while I was in a coma?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.754
-Robert?
-[door closes]

07:43.838 --> 07:45.590
-Pam, you were right.
-Usually am.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.634
I broke Cyril,
and broken Cyril broke the group.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.720
Yeah, it's a real butterfly effect.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.763
And the hurricane is everyone sucking.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.975
I know what I have to do,
but I don't know if I have the strength.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.059
You mean--

07:57.143 --> 07:59.729
Yes. I have to fix Cyril.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.107
You're gonna need this. Yoink.
I'll handle the others.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.819
Bartender, the biggest bottle
on your highest shelf!

08:06.903 --> 08:09.697
-Whoa, Cyril, leaving so soon?
-Ugh. Might as well.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.949
All the women here
think I'm a child kidnapper.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.494
-Creep.
-Failed child kidnapper.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.747
There's plenty of fish in the sea
who don't think you're a pervert.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.207
-How about a drink?
-Mescal?

08:19.290 --> 08:22.460
You know they cut down an acre
of rain forest for every bottle of this.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.711
I'll cut you down!

08:23.794 --> 08:25.671
Wait, no. Actually, the opposite.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.882
I, uh, actually would love to hang out.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.301
With me? Why? I'm so lame.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.552
-No, you're not!
-Ow.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.305
Sorry, I thought you'd at least
try to block that.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.598
Anyway, it's time we caught up.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.184
Take me to one of those
famous Cyril hot spots.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.519
-Is this a trick?
-Cyril,

08:39.602 --> 08:42.396
I am genuinely trying to reach out.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.024
Jesus, did you, like,
totally drop workouts?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.234
Seriously?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.486
[sighs] Yes.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.405
At least I didn't just
lie on the floor crying!

08:51.489 --> 08:54.367
-I got shot, okay?
-And now you won't shut up about it.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.412
Hi, Sara? Yeah, hey, could you stay
with the kids another hour?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.414
Sure, go ahead, order pizza.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.917
Oh, hey, Sara, there's a coupon
on the fridge in the--

09:03.000 --> 09:06.045
-[line disconnects]
-Hello? Oh, shit.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.172
She ain't gonna see that coupon.

09:08.256 --> 09:12.426
Man, tonight crashed and burned
like a school bus into a school bus.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.555
But I finally got a number.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.933
-And it's just a receipt.
-Are we splitting that, by the way?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.768
'Cause I think it was all on my card.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.521
Goddamn it, did you people
totally forget how to party?

09:23.604 --> 09:25.231
If you're looking to party--

09:25.314 --> 09:27.775
Krieger, you've already taken,
like, seven of those.

09:27.858 --> 09:31.195
Really? Ooh.
I might be going away for a while.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.365
It's like Archer coming out of a coma
put all of you in one.

09:34.448 --> 09:39.036
But I have the cure.
It's time for a Pampage!

09:40.788 --> 09:43.416
-It's a play on words: Pam and rampage.
-I got that.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.128
It's technically a portmanteau,
like "brunch" or "spork."

09:47.211 --> 09:48.713
Or "murdercide."

09:48.796 --> 09:51.257
It's a word. I was almost part of one.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.177
Look, I've got plans tonight
that I never let work friends in on,

09:55.261 --> 09:56.762
but this is an emergency,

09:56.846 --> 09:59.807
so you're all invited
to come melt your tits off.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.434
That seems extreme.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.394
-Agreed. I am in.
-I could melt.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.855
-My fingers are whispering!
-Krieger's in.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.524
-So do you know what it's time for?
-A Pampage?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.443
Oh, shit, I already said that part.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.527
But yes.

10:15.531 --> 10:18.534
So do you always
have these T-shirts in your car?

10:18.618 --> 10:19.869
"Pampage"!

10:19.952 --> 10:22.413
What happened to me?
I used to be great at flirting.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.497
-Eh.
-"Eh"?

10:23.581 --> 10:25.041
Krieger, male perspective?

10:25.124 --> 10:26.584
[whispers] Shh. I'm invisible.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.670
This isn't what I had in mind
when I said we should go out.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.631
Or is it?

10:32.506 --> 10:35.051
Sorry, I thought
we were closer to the corner.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.303
-Or is it?
-[muffled electronic music playing]

10:37.386 --> 10:40.181
Great, a scary warehouse party.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.349
Great, right?

10:41.432 --> 10:44.727
By day, it makes socks,
and by night, it rocks.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.897
But the sock machine
is still running, so be careful.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.568
-I think I might need a new bandage.
-I think you need to shut the hell up.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.862
We could jump 'em now.
It is a smaller group.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.281
-No. I live just around the corner.
-So?

10:57.365 --> 11:00.785
So? How about we kill someone
on the corner where your kids ride bikes?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.579
Yeah, that's what I thought.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.124
Ugh. We're gonna be here all night.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.960
[groans] I'm with an old who cares
about being up all night.

11:10.044 --> 11:13.297
-[bouncer] Yo, Pamageddon!
-Sploosh! My man!

11:13.381 --> 11:16.175
-Is that where that comes from?
-These sacrifices for the ring?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.386
-[laughs] Hell yes!
-No!

11:18.469 --> 11:21.472
Nah, just friends. Any chance
you could throw me a plus-four?

11:21.555 --> 11:23.808
After what you did
for my nana, anything, huh?

11:25.059 --> 11:28.312
Do not, under any circumstances,
try to keep up with her.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.232
[loud electronic music playing]

11:34.985 --> 11:36.654
-[grunts]
-[bell rings]

11:43.619 --> 11:44.912
Shots!

11:44.995 --> 11:46.747
-Aren't those toxic?
-Maybe!

11:46.831 --> 11:49.583
I am getting so many good tattoo ideas.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.254
-[gasps] Forehead!
-I'm gonna find a quiet corner and-- Whoa!

11:53.337 --> 11:56.966
Welcome to the good life, Sandra.
Damn it, Krieger, be careful!

11:57.049 --> 11:59.009
[Cyril] Easy. You'll break Jupiter.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.594
The planetarium, really?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.263
I asked you where you go to have fun,

12:02.346 --> 12:04.432
not where you went
on your fifth-grade field trip.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.852
It may not look like it,
but this place has a crazy singles scene.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.938
-As in they have a single year to live?
-What's that?

12:11.021 --> 12:13.983
Nothing, dear. Enjoy your stars.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.402
-While you can.
-Come on. It's fun.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.321
And fifth-grade field trips
don't have secret wine.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.408
I guess it depends
on your school and mother.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.119
Anyway, do planetarium shows end,
or do people just leave

12:25.202 --> 12:26.912
when they're depressed enough to…

12:29.206 --> 12:32.668
[gasps] …witness the majesty of space?

12:32.751 --> 12:35.087
-Pretty great, right?
-It really is.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.798
You know, I kinda spent a year in space.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.009
And that's enough wine for you, sir.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.637
Cyril, for the last time,
you cannot have wine in here.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.140
Run! We'll lose him in the asteroid belt!

12:47.183 --> 12:49.310
Huh. I didn't know he had friends.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.687
Oh, more of a coworker situation.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.771
[Pam] Shot!

12:53.355 --> 12:57.026
Ah, because all I do is work,
and now that Robert works with us,

12:57.109 --> 12:59.028
my husband is also my work husband.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
There's your problem.
You gotta set boundaries.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.283
That was my secret
when I tied the knot. Shot!

13:04.366 --> 13:06.869
-Wait, you're married?
-Oh, God, no.

13:06.952 --> 13:11.290
I'm talking about when I officiated
a Wiccan hand-binding ceremony. Shot!

13:11.957 --> 13:14.627
Ah, shit. Am I just doomed to be boring?

13:14.710 --> 13:18.297
Screw that. You just need to remember
what single life is like.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.717
And I've got the perfect reminder.
Krieger, wrap it up!

13:21.800 --> 13:23.093
Shoot!

13:23.177 --> 13:25.221
Stop dancing and fight me, Dad!

13:25.304 --> 13:27.723
Put him in a body bag! Yeah!

13:27.806 --> 13:31.227
-Do these shots while I get the keys.
-Done. Wait, keys?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.311
Hey! Keys to what?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.230
Hey, what the shit, Pam?

13:34.313 --> 13:37.441
I'll bring it back tomorrow. Maybe!

13:37.525 --> 13:40.277
To the edge! Back to the edge!

13:40.361 --> 13:41.654
[sighs] Uh.

13:41.737 --> 13:42.947
Guys?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.490
[tires squealing]

13:44.573 --> 13:46.408
They have a monster truck?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.369
Who the hell are these guys?

13:49.119 --> 13:52.456
This drug makes cars feel huge!

13:52.540 --> 13:54.291
It's so tiny and fast.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.586
If it was life-size,
it would be going 800 miles per hour!

13:57.670 --> 13:59.171
What? That's incredible!

13:59.255 --> 14:01.048
-[man] <i>Final lap!</i>
-You got this, Cyril!

14:01.131 --> 14:06.470
-It's just you and green. Careful.
-I. Can. Hold. It! [shouts]

14:07.221 --> 14:08.222
[Archer] Yes!

14:08.305 --> 14:11.559
In your face, green,
you absolute piece of shit!

14:11.642 --> 14:14.770
-I mean, good game. I guess.
-[whimpers]

14:16.272 --> 14:20.276
Jackson, you've got five minutes to cover
these ladies in sweat that isn't theirs.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.360
Make it three.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.904
Whoo!

14:25.865 --> 14:27.867
[man] I'm just saying, who does this help?

14:27.950 --> 14:31.620
To quote Edward Counsel,
revenge is but a small circle.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.498
Plus, it is getting late for revenge
and my babysitter.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.333
[Carl] And I'm weak from blood loss.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.210
So, we'll get 'em next time?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.546
-[Carl] Yeah, next time for sure, buddy!
-[phone buzzes]

14:40.629 --> 14:44.133
Oh, no, the boss says get the microchips
back now, or we're dead.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.553
How? I'm a master of strategy.
My tactics were flawless.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.471
And yet my forces lie decimated.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.725
Because you left your Beastmen
exposed to his Chaos Dwarf.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.602
Well, yeah, that's obvious now!

14:54.685 --> 14:55.936
Okay, double or nothing,

14:56.020 --> 14:57.980
which I guess means two candy bars?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.982
-Then prepare, knave, to--
-[gun cocks]

15:00.065 --> 15:02.401
Call me knave again.

15:02.484 --> 15:05.779
I'm kidding! Good role-playing, Kyle.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.366
So who's next,

15:09.450 --> 15:12.536
the cowboy or the scientist?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.204
[exclaims] The scientist!

15:14.288 --> 15:15.998
Okay, that's where we call it.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.542
Holy shit, is that--

15:18.626 --> 15:21.378
[Cheryl] That prince-y guy
who was gonna buy my house.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.214
Oh, no. Wait, guys,
maybe he hasn't seen us yet.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.549
Maybe it's just a stripper.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.261
A stripper dressed
specifically like Prince Fawad?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.221
-My friends!
-Oh, shit.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.015
[laughs] I knew I recognized you.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.393
You were all there that day my mother
and I planned to buy a local mansion.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.145
I think you have us confused--

15:38.228 --> 15:40.230
No, no. Then you seduced me.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.441
Then someone else tranquilized me

15:42.524 --> 15:44.860
before we could consummate
our relationship.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.197
-I don't remember that day.
-We do get hit in the head a lot.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.573
And tranquilized a lot.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.118
Anyway, congrats on figuring out
you're gay before you had sex with Lana.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.663
Gay? [laughs] No, no.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.958
I just come here to pick up
lonely, horny women.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.544
Yes, so, would you like to come back
to my penthouse for drugs?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.129
Yeah, I could use a top-off.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.881
Yeah, thanks but no thanks.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.175
-But actually, thanks. We'll come.
-Really, Lana?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.886
Partying with a drug-dealing prince
feels a little extreme.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.348
Maybe for boring married Lana,
but for cool single Lana,

16:14.431 --> 16:17.476
it's just another school night.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.269
Well, your overdose.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.065
-Hurry up with that fool. They're coming.
-Just stand up, man.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.942
Is this the hospital, guys?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.111
They have armed guards now?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.780
Who the hell are these guys?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.200
[Pam] Sploosh…

16:33.283 --> 16:35.369
would love to see this.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.329
He's working on his master's
in architecture.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.165
I'm doing this, right? I have to, right?
Are there more shots?

16:40.249 --> 16:43.127
-[Fawad] So, ladies, interloper…
-Yo!

16:43.210 --> 16:44.837
…shall we begin?

16:44.920 --> 16:48.882
That's the second-biggest
automatic lube wall I've ever seen.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.552
Don't worry. We can take this slow.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.637
Said the naked man.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.097
Thanks for noticing.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.765
[Archer] My Berserker cries,

16:56.849 --> 16:59.768
burying his ax
in your weeping king's chest.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.355
As my Dragon Warrior rips off his…

17:03.439 --> 17:04.440
penis.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.608
-Not my choice. Rolled a two.
-[grunts]

17:06.692 --> 17:09.778
Hey, you can beat up a kid.
Now just do that in the field.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.740
Yeah, I don't know if I want
to be a field agent anymore,

17:12.823 --> 17:14.366
but I'm afraid to tell anyone.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.827
-What? No, Cyril, that's amazing.
-Oh, God.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.203
It is? Why?

17:18.287 --> 17:21.123
I thought you were getting worse
in the field because I was insulting you.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.958
You're just getting worse
because you hate it.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.961
-I still don't love the insults.
-You'll get used to it, moron.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.464
Anyway, you gotta do
what's right for you, Cyril.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.134
Because tonight reminded me:
you're kinda special, and--

17:32.217 --> 17:33.635
Wait, hold on. Getting a call.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.805
-Uh-huh.
-[Pam] <i>Penthouse. Crazy lube wall.</i>

17:36.889 --> 17:39.683
<i>Horny tigers. Pampage.</i>
<i>Gotta get rid of the body.</i>

17:39.767 --> 17:43.145
Oh, thank God. I almost bonded with Cyril.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.778
This better be good.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.948
Cyril and I were doing something
way less weird than this.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.202
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I think he mixed two blues with a green.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.455
No, I took that.
He took three reds and a white.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.792
I shouldn't have tried to keep up.
I shouldn't have tried to keep up.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.835
What the hell happened?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.505
I tried to give myself
a tattoo of a witch skull

18:09.588 --> 18:12.049
with colored lube,
but it got kinda blobby.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.801
I think he meant with the dead guy.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.469
Lana, you couldn't handle this?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.763
I was gonna be his first.
I was almost his first.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.099
Obviously we're too drunk,
and his guards are right outside.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.018
Fine, we got this.
Does Krieger have a bone saw?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.520
To chop up a civilian?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.438
To not go to jail, Cyril!

18:26.522 --> 18:30.567
No. No chopping. We just need a way
to sneak a body out of the building.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.944
Ooh. I got this.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.695
[all laughing loudly]

18:33.779 --> 18:35.364
[Krieger] Gentlemen, don't wait up.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.826
Let's get him to the docks
in something inconspicuous.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.787
[engine revving]

18:41.870 --> 18:43.455
[tires squealing]

18:43.539 --> 18:46.708
[car alarm blaring]

18:51.380 --> 18:55.676
-Focus! We're in a car chase!
-Shut up. My sitter is leaving.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.887
And we wouldn't even be in this car chase
if you weren't a coward.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.390
Would a coward have nerve gas?

19:01.473 --> 19:04.893
-Where the hell did you get that?
-Warehouse. Just an insurance policy.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.019
Right, Carl?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.105
Carl?

19:08.188 --> 19:09.940
I think Carl is dead.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.194
-Okay, we're good to go. Krieger?
-Will you hurry up?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.446
-You're embarrassing me.
-[all gasp]

19:16.530 --> 19:18.365
-Damn it.
-Who the hell is that?

19:18.448 --> 19:19.867
Hey, don't need the light.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.702
Then you should not have crossed us.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.955
-Did we cross you?
-Probably. We do cross a lot of people.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.290
Yeah, who are you guys?

19:26.373 --> 19:29.209
We're the guards from that warehouse
you blew up today.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.962
-Well, that's a relief.
-Why could that possibly be a relief?

19:32.045 --> 19:34.923
-We know they're not good guards.
-Archer, he has a gun.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.216
Yeah, we all have guns.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.427
But we have nerve gas.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.220
Insurance policy!

19:40.804 --> 19:42.806
[distorted shout]

19:42.890 --> 19:43.891
Oh.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.935
[guards screaming]

19:47.019 --> 19:48.145
[cheers]

19:48.228 --> 19:51.064
All right, Cyril, AKA Murderfoot!

19:51.148 --> 19:52.983
The field agent is back!

19:53.066 --> 19:55.194
I guess maybe I am. Ah!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.696
Cheese and crackers,
this pavement is uneven!

19:57.779 --> 20:00.073
-And he's gone.
-Which we need to be.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.828
Guys, someone should say something.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.830
I stole a bunch of his lube.

20:06.914 --> 20:07.915
Amen.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.089
-[gasps] Who's ready to party?
-He's alive?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.675
-Oh, thank God.
-You didn't check his pulse?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.969
No. We were crazy high!

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
Oh, still are, to be honest.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.348
Guys, grab the truck!

20:24.431 --> 20:26.558
[all grunting]

20:26.642 --> 20:28.727
We got this.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.730
Come on!

20:31.813 --> 20:33.315
Thanks, Murderfoot.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.786
-Um. Why did it explode?
-[chuckles] That was me.

20:45.869 --> 20:49.081
[sighs] I learned a lesson today.
No idea what it is.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.916
Don't use lube to make a tattoo?

20:50.999 --> 20:53.168
-Sort of looks like a palm tree.
-I see a fountain pen.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.004
[gasps] It's a Rorschach tattoo!

20:56.588 --> 20:58.590
[chuckles] Oh, yeah, Sandra.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.717
How did you find us?

21:00.801 --> 21:03.303
I followed the monster truck
and the explosion

21:03.387 --> 21:05.430
and whatever that cloud was.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.724
-Nerve gas.
-I'd say cyclosarin.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.643
Jesus Christ!

21:09.726 --> 21:12.562
You realize the chemicals
you dumped in the ocean

21:12.646 --> 21:15.816
will probably kill ten times
the seals you saved.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.818
In our defense, going out was your idea.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.321
Because I didn't know you were monsters!

21:21.405 --> 21:24.491
Guys, the microchips were for land mines.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.575
Oh, of course!

21:25.659 --> 21:26.994
-Land mines!
-Obviously.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.454
The Pampage does it again!

21:29.538 --> 21:30.580
Does what?

21:30.664 --> 21:33.333
[chanting] Pampage! Pampage!

21:33.417 --> 21:37.129
-[all] Pampage! Pampage! Pampage!
-Whoa!

21:37.212 --> 21:38.255
Oh, no.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.092
[Archer] Any second.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.970
She's coming up.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.474
We should probably go get her.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.269
[gasps] Pampage!
