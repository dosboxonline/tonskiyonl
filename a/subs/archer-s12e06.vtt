WEBVTT

00:07.340 --> 00:08.341
[glass shatters]

00:08.425 --> 00:11.803
Sorry. Slipped from my hand.
So, we have a contract?

00:11.886 --> 00:13.638
A very lucrative contract.

00:13.722 --> 00:17.600
To go to Japan and eliminate
the assassin known as the Dingo,

00:17.684 --> 00:20.270
with whom I believe
I've crossed paths before.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.063
-Yes, dear.
-Excellent.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.024
Well, I should prepare. Colleagues.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.570
God, he really hates glasses now.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.698
-Yeah.
-Well, that went better than expected.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.116
[retching]

00:33.199 --> 00:36.161
Jesus, are you throwing up from your soul?

00:36.244 --> 00:39.372
[groans] Yeah, most of my soul
is actually in here now,

00:39.456 --> 00:41.958
right next to the corn,
which I haven't eaten in a week.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.919
Either you just dredged up
a painfully repressed memory,

00:45.003 --> 00:48.590
or you ordered the all-you-can-eat,
day-old shrimp fry from Cajun Casey's.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.885
-[groans] Yep, one of those.
-I can't resist it either.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.595
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.680
[retching]

00:55.764 --> 00:58.349
Quick question.
What in the goddamned hell?

00:58.433 --> 01:02.020
It says it was
his first mission as an agent.

01:02.103 --> 01:06.107
The Dingo killed his first love.
Other than Ms. Archer, of course.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.567
-Still gross.
-Still hot.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.527
-Paging Dr. Oedipus.
-Why?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.613
Also, when did he become a doctor?

01:11.696 --> 01:13.740
-And is he single?
-Okay, refocusing!

01:13.823 --> 01:17.035
It says here the Dingo may be
the most elusive person on the planet,

01:17.118 --> 01:19.537
<i>and Archer was never the same</i>
<i>after his first mission.</i>

01:20.955 --> 01:24.000
[Lana] <i>So he was a better spy</i>
<i>before all this happened?</i>

01:24.083 --> 01:25.084
[Malory] <i>Well--</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:27.462
Okay, you're saying
you're glad he had this trauma

01:27.545 --> 01:29.297
because it made him a great spy,

01:29.380 --> 01:32.634
but now he needs to deal with it
to become a better spy?

01:32.717 --> 01:34.969
Oh, I wouldn't say that…

01:36.054 --> 01:37.263
but yes.

01:41.059 --> 01:45.647
[McGinley] <i>Sterling, I've made these tapes</i>
<i>to prepare you for your first mission.</i>

01:45.730 --> 01:50.527
<i>I could tell you all of this, of course,</i>
<i>but I might be otherwise occupied.</i>

01:50.610 --> 01:51.694
[chuckles]

01:52.362 --> 01:53.488
So cool.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.949
<i>Now, these won't be the standard methods,</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:58.451
<i>but you were never</i>
<i>top of your class by the book.</i>

01:58.535 --> 02:02.080
<i>You have something special.</i>
<i>Intuition, feel.</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:05.625
<i>And if you learn to trust it,</i>
<i>you'll come through just fine.</i>

02:06.167 --> 02:09.045
Oh, God. [groans] Oh, my God.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.422
-[gasps]
-I-- I spilled my drink!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.842
-Oh!
-Oh, God.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.343
Okay, I get that.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.846
Yep.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.638
Uh, two rooms for myself
and my rakishly handsome,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.849
yet somehow single nephew, Sterling.

03:02.932 --> 03:07.395
I'll make a note.
"Weird, uncle-nephew relationship."

03:07.478 --> 03:12.525
Uh. So, uh, what brings you
to the, uh, this hotel?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.944
A bike. And a desire to not starve.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.446
[chuckles]

03:16.529 --> 03:19.407
-Your uncle's a bit of a character.
-My-- My what? Oh.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.743
Yeah, yeah, he's a handful.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.913
Or is "handful" just what they call
a sleazebag in America?

03:24.996 --> 03:29.375
Oh, come on. He's not a bag of sleaze.
He's, you know, more of a thin coating.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.919
-[bell rings]
-[giggles]

03:31.002 --> 03:33.212
So this is my first time in Tokyo.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.507
Uh, think you could maybe show me
around a little tonight?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.843
Just think how funny it'll be
when you ditch me

03:38.927 --> 03:40.929
at the bathhouse
after stealing my clothes.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.722
Tell you what. I'll think about it.

03:42.805 --> 03:47.185
-Um, how-- how hard?
-Well, you tell me.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.107
And phrasing. Delightful.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.903
You must find a way to embrace the moment,

03:56.986 --> 03:59.030
exist entirely within it.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.116
<i>The rest, the rest is easy.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:04.827
So we just gonna stare
at the lobby of a hotel

04:04.911 --> 04:07.372
we're not staying at
like the world's worst stalkers?

04:07.455 --> 04:08.581
Goddamn it, Lana!

04:08.665 --> 04:11.125
Do the words "complex inner journey"
mean nothing to you?

04:11.209 --> 04:13.795
They mean something to me!
The mystery of human life.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.923
The strangeness. All the blood.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.968
He took "inner journey" literally!

04:20.051 --> 04:21.511
Just drive, Metamucil.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.848
[McGinley] Our mission
is to protect this man,

04:25.932 --> 04:29.394
Tadashi Kodo,
from an assassin known as the Dingo.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.063
Who is he?
Political freedom fighter? Scientist?

04:32.146 --> 04:33.564
[gasps] My secret father?

04:33.648 --> 04:36.734
-The head of the yakuza.
-Japanese organized crime?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.987
Hard to feel like
the good guys on this one.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.864
Good, bad, these are just words.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.408
But true evil is real.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.828
Evil is what you call someone
who isn't paying you.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.998
-Here, have a drink.
-Oh, no. I'm trying to stay sharp.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.542
Wouldn't recommend it.
I've seen your training scores.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.295
Um, can we go back to the McGinley
who thought I was great?

04:55.378 --> 05:00.258
Let me put this delicately.
Your analytical mind is not your strength.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.093
Wow. That did not feel delicate.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.469
First time never does.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.055
Simply put,
you need to trust your intuition.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.809
So what's a little frontal
lobe paralysis between friends?

05:09.892 --> 05:12.562
All right. But, you know, just this once.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.981
That's what I always say. <i>Kanpai!</i>

05:15.690 --> 05:17.442
[Lana] Well, if you're finished.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.069
I'm never finished, Lana!
So you're welcome.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.196
All right, shut up. Let's get into this.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.033
William Radken, ex-MI6,
now a freelance fixer.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.035
The Dingo's gonna kill him.
Not our problem.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.162
Yes! I love it when things
aren't our problem!

05:29.245 --> 05:33.082
MI6. Wonder how much training they need
to fetch coffee for the CIA.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.045
Oh, it's really humiliating
how they don't work for their mom, right?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.297
Krieger, you're here for comms
and surveillance tech.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.758
And for my extensive knowledge
of Japanese culture.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.302
Reading a couple dirty comics
doesn't make you an expert.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.555
We need to stay close to William and wait
for our moment to neutralize the Dingo.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.475
Which is why you should flirt with
and probably date William.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.518
Ooh! Development!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.854
Quiet down. His room is next door.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.815
And being that close to an active target
seems like a great way to die.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.568
Oh, come on.
At best, it's a pretty good way to die.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.987
And what are our other options here?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.782
I could try to reanimate
and remote control a corpse.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.658
That's always your plan.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.535
[groans] I'll get suited up.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.579
So… [clears throat]

06:11.662 --> 06:13.623
…to make you more comfortable…

06:14.874 --> 06:16.125
I should go change.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.627
Uh. Why?

06:21.297 --> 06:23.174
Glengoolie Blue, neat.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.384
Better make it a double
after that bullshit.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.845
[laughs] Is it bullshit season already?

06:27.929 --> 06:31.516
Yeah, fly you a few thousand miles
to tell you they're not ready to decide.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.851
-Same as it ever was.
-[sighs]

06:33.935 --> 06:36.521
But it does tend to bring out
the inherent pointlessness of life.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.231
I'll drink to that, sweetheart.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.234
This isn't what I expected.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.485
How so?

06:42.568 --> 06:45.363
-I guess it's less Japanese.
-[laughs]

06:45.446 --> 06:47.448
That is the thing about Japan.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.325
Hey, why is your English so good?

06:49.408 --> 06:53.996
You know, classic star-crossed lovers,
complex immigration stuff,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.498
Dad's not around anymore.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.916
You know how that goes.

06:56.999 --> 07:00.670
Yeah, well, I didn't
even know my father so--

07:00.753 --> 07:02.880
Sometimes I kinda wish I didn't know mine.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.800
-But <i>c'est la vie.</i>
-Is that Japanese for something?

07:05.883 --> 07:08.094
Yeah. "Life's a shit show."

07:08.177 --> 07:09.262
[William] <i>Of course it is.</i>

07:09.345 --> 07:11.764
When you're married
to someone from work, again.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.559
Well, look at you, going right
back to the well you pissed in.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.852
Elegantly put.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.979
Well, I married someone I didn't work with

07:18.062 --> 07:19.522
and now he owns the company.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.358
Sometimes the well pisses back.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.277
You don't think she actually
likes him, do you?

07:24.360 --> 07:28.114
Subtle flush, open body language,
gesture amplitude increasing--

07:28.197 --> 07:30.867
-That's a no, right? Say it's a no!
-Why are you so mad?

07:30.950 --> 07:34.245
Look, on a mission,
feelings don't end well. It'll ruin--

07:35.246 --> 07:36.956
-They're not an option!
-[woman] Ugh.

07:37.039 --> 07:41.127
Come on, man, not working
for your mother is always an option.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.504
You haven't met her
and stared into those eyes.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.632
Like a combination of a shark
and two bigger sharks.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.135
-Have you tried bopping her on the nose?
-Only in my dreams.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.554
I woke up apologizing
with a giant erection.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.639
[laughing]

07:53.723 --> 07:56.100
Uh, maybe too much for a first date?

07:56.184 --> 07:59.645
-Oh. So you think this is a date?
-Uh, maybe?

08:05.943 --> 08:07.320
[glass shatters]

08:09.906 --> 08:12.825
First date, ten years ago,
that was probably my best kiss.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.829
-Did not call me back.
-Oof. Real slap in the nuts.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.664
[groans]

08:18.748 --> 08:22.627
Sorry, Wild One, I didn't mean
to interrupt your costume party.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.879
Kinda woozy from that kiss, you know?

08:24.962 --> 08:26.839
-High five?
-[speaking Japanese]

08:26.923 --> 08:29.675
Uh, that didn't sound
like Japanese for "high five."

08:29.759 --> 08:33.596
[speaking Japanese]

08:33.679 --> 08:36.641
-[grunts]
-"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"

08:36.724 --> 08:37.892
Whoo!

08:37.975 --> 08:39.060
So here we are.

08:39.143 --> 08:43.231
Two romantically unavailable people
with an undeniable rapport.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.149
-[grunts]
-[patrons screaming]

08:45.233 --> 08:46.484
[glass shatters]

08:48.694 --> 08:50.905
[Lana] Enjoying each other's company.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.240
[groans]

08:55.493 --> 08:58.579
[William] While our spouses
are thousands of miles away.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.500
Let's get out of here!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.628
Let's get out of here.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.812
Ah… Can't do it.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.731
[sighs] Nope. Too married.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.650
Tell you what, though. What if--

09:27.733 --> 09:29.735
I can't wait for how weird
this is gonna be.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.072
What if we go into your room,
cuddle for five minutes?

09:33.155 --> 09:36.617
-No kissing.
-And then we retire to our separate rooms

09:36.701 --> 09:39.579
and then pleasure ourselves
intensely enough to cause injury.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.456
And I am setting my watch.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.168
Feelings were bad enough, but Jesus,
just cheat like a decent person.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.714
-Goddamn, that's weird.
-Yeah, I know, right?

09:50.298 --> 09:53.009
Ooh-hoo! This one's a real page-turner.

10:01.517 --> 10:05.229
-Oh, no! She's gone!
-Oh, hey, Reiko.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.648
But now I'm pretending to be cool.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.818
I don't think she noticed. [giggles]

10:10.901 --> 10:13.487
-I gotta get to work.
-Oh, crap. Yeah, I should--

10:13.571 --> 10:16.365
Check with your "uncle"
about your "vacation"?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.827
Uh, I assume you're using
those finger quotes for emphasis.

10:19.910 --> 10:23.497
Because I'm an ignorant monster
who doesn't understand quotation marks?

10:23.581 --> 10:27.418
Look, Sterling, your uncle's
been through here a few times.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.003
And let me give you a tip.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.923
The hotel staff always knows everything.

10:33.007 --> 10:36.177
-Like everything, everything?
-Yup. Not that we want to.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.095
Hey, uh, can we maybe--

10:38.179 --> 10:41.265
Sterling, I went out with you
because I was bored

10:41.349 --> 10:43.684
and you looked like a dumb bit of fun.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.478
Yeah, uh, same here.

10:45.561 --> 10:50.066
I was just gonna ask you
if we could never see each other again.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.986
But, I will say, you've got
something interesting going on.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.322
But let me tell you
the one thing I don't like.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.199
-Do you have to?
-Your name.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.660
"Sterling"? Doesn't really fit you.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.411
You could call me Archer.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.205
Hmm. I like that.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.749
See you later, Archer.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.544
And then, bang,
she hits the guy with a beer bottle,

11:10.628 --> 11:12.338
and we zoom away on her motorcycle.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.131
And I just really like her, you know?

11:15.508 --> 11:20.096
-[speaking Japanese]
-[clears throat]

11:20.179 --> 11:24.016
Mr. Kodo says that if we're going
to play grab-ass all day,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.227
he would've brought thicker gloves.

11:26.310 --> 11:30.022
Sterling, appreciate the energy,
but let's get back to business, eh?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.982
Oh, could you actually call me Archer?

11:32.066 --> 11:36.195
My girlfriend likes that better.
Reiko. She's Japanese. So cool.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.906
Okay, so first off,
before we set the agenda here,

11:38.989 --> 11:43.202
let's all be extra respectful
of the encounter that Lana had last night.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.620
By bringing it up immediately?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.580
I'm saying,
now that it has been brought up,

11:46.664 --> 11:49.041
I forget by whom,
we should be respectful about it.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.709
Though it was pretty messed up.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.878
Hey, you still working
on that helmet for dolphins

11:52.962 --> 11:55.047
that lets them communicate sexual consent?

11:55.131 --> 11:56.549
Smoke bomb!

11:56.632 --> 11:59.343
Look, your voyage
of masturbatory exploration aside--

11:59.427 --> 12:01.595
If it's aside,
why do you keep bringing it up?

12:01.679 --> 12:04.849
-And even if that were cheating--
-I didn't say cheating. You did.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.475
But it totally is. Continue.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.687
You hate Robert, so why do you even care?

12:09.770 --> 12:12.314
Look, if you want to "quasi-ghost-bang"
some ex-spy

12:12.398 --> 12:14.108
from a second-tier organization…

12:14.191 --> 12:17.611
Oh, my God, it always comes back
to the same old dick-swinging.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.821
Ha! Not true.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.782
This involves, at minimum,
two kinds of dick-swinging.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.327
But look, when feelings get mixed
into missions, bad stuff happens.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.830
So for now, let's just focus
on the next step in the plan.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.914
Which is?

12:28.998 --> 12:32.460
Getting William out in the open
so the Dingo can try to kill him.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.628
[sighs] Goddamn it.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.302
Ah, shit. Sniper!

12:42.219 --> 12:43.512
[grunts]

12:48.517 --> 12:50.227
[McGinley] Sterling!

12:50.853 --> 12:53.939
Archer, stop thinking. Move!

13:06.952 --> 13:08.204
[screaming]

13:09.747 --> 13:12.541
He is saying, "Holy shit!"

13:12.625 --> 13:14.126
When did you get here?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.839
At some point, the training takes over.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.800
And then you ignore the training
and listen to your inner awesomeness.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.387
I just can't imagine what it
feels like to be shot at.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.390
Yeah, well, I guess,
I didn't actually get shot at.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.476
Come to think of it,
I didn't even see a sniper.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.852
Was there one?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.729
Why would McGinley fake a sniper?

13:33.812 --> 13:37.650
Other than gaining him the total trust
of the head of the yakuza?

13:37.733 --> 13:41.320
Wow. I just realized something.
We should have sex again.

13:41.403 --> 13:45.783
-How about behind that tree over there?
-And that is why I love you.

13:45.866 --> 13:46.992
Whoops.

13:53.749 --> 13:57.294
You're sure the Dingo will have to
move out into the open to take the shot?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.797
[Krieger] As long as she stays between
that table and that plant,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.966
the Dingo has to move into the open.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.135
Right on cue.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.388
The Dingo! [vocalizes dramatically]

14:07.471 --> 14:08.597
Damn it, Krieger!

14:08.681 --> 14:11.976
Relax, at this distance, it's physically
impossible for them to hear us.

14:12.059 --> 14:15.020
There's something to be said
for the mood of a time and place.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.106
That's what the dolphins keep saying.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.066
Come on.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.820
Step out. Step out and I'll be free.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.905
Actually, the human mind
can't heal like that.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.408
We're doomed to play out
the same patterns over and over

14:27.491 --> 14:29.577
until we deal with the root causes.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.039
[Archer] And…

14:35.875 --> 14:36.709
no!

14:39.211 --> 14:42.464
[Krieger] Backup plan!
I stashed the Krieger drone nearby.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.550
-We have drone liftoff.
-[beeping]

14:44.633 --> 14:46.510
And I'm following.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.554
And the Dingo noticed me.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.055
And now shot me.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.016
-[beeping dies down]
-Aw.

14:53.183 --> 14:56.604
So, I guess Lana had some second thoughts.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.565
Yes, I would like to talk
to her about that.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.650
[straining]

15:01.734 --> 15:03.277
Well, you make some great points,

15:03.360 --> 15:06.697
but maybe I thought endangering
an innocent bystander wasn't worth it.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.992
Endangering innocent bystanders
is, like, 90% of what we do.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.411
And the other 10% of the time,
we're on break.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.330
Look, I don't want the guy to die.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.956
That is just so selfish.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.791
I would kill six of this guy myself,

15:17.875 --> 15:20.586
but I guess that's just
because I'm a professional.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.213
So we are gonna do this again
and make sure you don't tell

15:23.297 --> 15:25.925
Mr. Cuddles anything
because otherwise, it doesn't work.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.845
Please, Mr. Cuddles is my father.
Call me Cuddle-boo-boo.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.263
Goddamn it!

15:31.347 --> 15:32.848
[McGinley] <i>My guess is that the Dingo</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:36.018
<i>will take his shot at Kodo</i>
<i>at the wrestling stadium.</i>

15:36.101 --> 15:38.938
<i>That's what I would do.</i>
<i>You're ready for this, Sterling.</i>

15:39.021 --> 15:40.814
<i>Just trust your instincts.</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:42.149
-[bell rings]
-[grunts]

15:43.192 --> 15:45.486
I did not think it was
this kind of wrestling.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.570
[scoffs]

15:46.654 --> 15:49.073
[speaking Japanese]

15:50.991 --> 15:52.326
Mr. Kodo says that

15:52.409 --> 15:55.579
if he wants to see a grown man
in a diaper hug another man,

15:55.663 --> 15:58.499
he will check your hotel room later.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.501
Sick burn, Mr. Kodo!

16:01.502 --> 16:04.630
I gotta say, for a yakuza boss,
he seems pretty chill.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.466
Though you did just give me a high three.

16:07.549 --> 16:11.178
Sometimes Mr. Kodo's jokes
don't land as well as he likes.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.515
Oh, Sterling, I need you
to do a sweep of the VIP area.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.267
Wait. You want me
to leave you alone with Kodo?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.477
I can handle things here.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.397
I told you, thinking
isn't your strong suit.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.524
Just do it and come back.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.943
[crowd cheering]

16:29.613 --> 16:30.823
[banging]

16:30.906 --> 16:32.199
Reiko! What are you doing here?

16:32.282 --> 16:36.704
Duh, I'm a concierge.
I can get tickets to anything.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.914
Ax Yamaguchi doing the Scissor Guillotine

16:38.998 --> 16:41.542
is basically pure sex.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.045
Also, maybe I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.214
I don't know.
Something isn't right about this.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.592
McGinley said to trust my instincts, and
my instincts say you shouldn't be here.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.845
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-What a coincidence.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.180
I also don't want me to get hurt.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.765
-But I can take care of myself.
-[grunts]

16:56.849 --> 16:59.643
Oh, shit! Right through the table!

16:59.727 --> 17:00.769
-Whoo-hoo!
-Damn it,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.522
-we've lost containment. Not good.
-[bell rings]

17:05.607 --> 17:07.818
-Everyone ready?
-Also, follow up,

17:07.901 --> 17:10.946
-does everyone love rhetorical questions?
-Ass.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.703
Hold on, I just had my pass.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.417
McGinley!

17:25.794 --> 17:28.213
-[gunshot]
-[crowd screaming]

17:38.474 --> 17:41.977
-McGinley, stay with me! I need you!
-[groans]

17:42.061 --> 17:43.729
You'll figure it out.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.230
I did.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.108
I mean, until now, obviously.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.541
I had a big speech all planned,

18:04.625 --> 18:08.879
but I can't remember it right now.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.923
McGinley!

18:11.757 --> 18:13.801
Come on. You can make it.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.470
Damn it. I had something for this.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.474
[gasping]

18:20.557 --> 18:22.267
[crying]

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
McGinley!

18:29.525 --> 18:32.486
[Krieger making revving sounds]

18:38.367 --> 18:40.202
Hi, Reiko. Been a while.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.080
Switch in the tunnel.
Huh, not a bad trick.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.415
-Smoke bomb!
-[coughing]

18:45.499 --> 18:50.587
Oh, man, that's way more effective
than just yelling it. [coughs]

18:56.552 --> 18:58.011
Go around and cut her off!

19:01.181 --> 19:03.517
Oh. [grunts] Krieger, get this off!

19:03.600 --> 19:05.811
Good thought,
but I don't think we have time for that.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.688
Remove it from my face!

19:07.771 --> 19:10.941
Oh, gotcha.
Yeah, you just poke it right here.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.531
Ow! Shit!

19:20.659 --> 19:23.871
-Can you run slower, you think?
-I got shot!

19:23.954 --> 19:25.873
We all get shot, Lana!

19:36.049 --> 19:38.802
Great work, team! Maybe next time
you can give her a map too!

19:38.886 --> 19:42.264
And then learn English
so you can understand this insult!

19:42.347 --> 19:43.932
We all know English! [speaking Japanese]

19:45.142 --> 19:47.436
My cardio's still great
if you were wondering!

19:47.519 --> 19:50.480
-I wasn't!
-I've also learned cool new sex stuff!

19:50.564 --> 19:52.608
-I was pretty inexperienced back then.
-[laughs]

19:52.691 --> 19:54.401
Tell me about it!

19:54.484 --> 19:57.696
You just sort of flopped around
like an epileptic fish.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.073
Now you're just trying
to hurt my feelings!

20:03.869 --> 20:06.622
Drop it, Reiko.
There's nowhere left to go.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.625
Not by myself, sure.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.461
But what if we went together?

20:12.544 --> 20:16.715
Oh, come on. What if we just
ran away and figured this thing out?

20:17.424 --> 20:21.094
Archer, we've both done things we regret.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.681
Maybe here's where we start over.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.101
[grunts]

20:29.269 --> 20:32.439
-I really wish you hadn't done that.
-[gunshot]

20:32.522 --> 20:34.691
[grunting]

20:35.901 --> 20:37.361
Who knows what would've happened?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.446
Archer…

20:48.038 --> 20:49.039
You okay?

20:49.122 --> 20:52.209
I know that when I look over the edge,
she's just gonna have disappeared again.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.548
-Nope. Wow. She is real dead.
-Yup.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.886
Well, the good news is,
I feel exactly zero percent better.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.013
Well, you did just get stabbed.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.182
Strong point, Lana. But you know what?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
Reiko is the one
who started calling me Archer.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.354
So I think from now on,
you should call me Sterling.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.689
-Really?
-No, forget it.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.732
Bad idea.
I have a lot invested in that name.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.110
I mean, just from
a branding perspective alone.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.822
-I'm just sorry this all happened to you.
-Yeah, me too.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.700
-Sorry you ruined your marriage.
-Now, Archer? Really?

21:24.783 --> 21:29.121
[chuckles] Uh-oh.
No time for a retort. Archer out.
