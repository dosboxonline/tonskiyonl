[ gasps ] oh, no, he's not.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.688
[ chains rattling, growling ]

18:43.690 --> 18:45.223
He-hello?

18:45.225 --> 18:46.891
Voice: Dick...

18:46.893 --> 18:50.295
I've come for you.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.764
A ghost!

18:51.766 --> 18:54.699
Are you the spirit of the
old woman whose condo I stole?

18:54.701 --> 18:57.836
No, I'm a generic
ghost.

18:57.838 --> 18:59.905
[ screams ]

19:01.308 --> 19:02.707
Whoa, that was fast.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.242
We didn't even get to do
the bleeding walls

19:04.244 --> 19:05.811
Or the fake satanic ritual.

19:06.847 --> 19:08.847
Tuttle, you can
come out now.

19:08.849 --> 19:10.582
It's already over?

19:10.584 --> 19:11.916
Yeah.
Sorry, man.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.253
Is that what you think
a ghost looks like?

19:16.791 --> 19:18.723
-[ beep ]
<i> -hey, this is chris pratt.</i>

19:18.725 --> 19:20.192
<i> Nah, I'm just playin'.</i>

19:20.194 --> 19:21.994
<i> It's stan. Leave a message</i>
<i> after the...</i>

19:21.996 --> 19:23.595
[ beep ]

19:23.597 --> 19:25.330
[ chuckles ]
oh, that was good, stan.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.865
I needed that laugh.

19:26.867 --> 19:29.934
It's been rough lately, stealing
the house from you and all.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.604
Anyhoo, I've got
a big surprise for you.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.406
Meet me at the house.

19:34.408 --> 19:36.208
You're gonna be thrilled.

19:36.210 --> 19:37.542
Kay, bye.

19:37.544 --> 19:41.746
Whew. Dick's gone, and now
I'm gonna get my family back.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.148
Well done, me.

19:44.618 --> 19:45.951
[ gasps ]

19:51.091 --> 19:53.425
Whew. That could have gotten
out of hand.

19:53.427 --> 19:55.427
[ blows ]

19:55.429 --> 19:58.563
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
No!

19:58.565 --> 20:00.265
Shit.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.769
[ car doors closing ]

20:04.771 --> 20:07.305
What the [bleep]
did you do?!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.707
I got rid of dick!

20:08.709 --> 20:11.510
And I saved
the family photo.

20:11.512 --> 20:13.111
You burned down the house!

20:13.113 --> 20:17.649
Yes, but what I learned is,
it's not about the house.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.452
It's the people
who make a home.

20:20.454 --> 20:21.720
The carpenters?
No.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.388
The architect.
No.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.524
Contractors?
No.

20:25.526 --> 20:26.925
What are you talking about?!

20:26.927 --> 20:28.527
Let me
explain another way.

20:28.529 --> 20:30.062
It's like this photo.

20:30.064 --> 20:32.397
The house is the frame,
which isn't important.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.000
You get me? But you guys are
the people in the photo.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.669
All: No shit!

20:37.671 --> 20:39.271
[ grunting ]

20:39.273 --> 20:40.672
The giant was real!

20:40.674 --> 20:42.006
And he's got
a hell of an arm.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.942
Damn, you gave
klaus a babysitter

20:43.944 --> 20:45.944
And he still burned
down the house?

20:45.946 --> 20:48.213
Come on, jeff,
let's do it in the ashes.

20:48.215 --> 20:50.815
Babe, you are
such a little freak.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.218
Whoa that's got to be
tough to hear, stan.

20:53.220 --> 20:57.723
Why's that? Should I be upset
my daughter pulls ass?

20:58.359 --> 21:00.326
Have a great night!
