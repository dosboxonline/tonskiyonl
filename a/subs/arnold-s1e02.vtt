[calm magical music plays]

00:13.805 --> 00:16.224
[Arnold] I think destiny
is what we make of it.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.811
You have to have the vision,

00:19.894 --> 00:23.314
and then if you follow that,
I think miracles can happen.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.987
So this is exactly what
my life has been about.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.282
I saw the peak of bodybuilding.
I climbed that peak.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.744
Then I saw the other peak.
The leading man.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.537
The movie star.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.416
And it reminds me of
this famous mountain climber,

00:41.499 --> 00:42.876
Edmund Hillary,

00:44.044 --> 00:46.588
who was the first man
to ever climb Mt. Everest.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.676
The press asked him,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.803
"What were you thinking about
when you looked around

00:53.887 --> 00:55.138
and you were up on this peak?"

00:56.222 --> 00:57.682
He said,

00:57.766 --> 00:59.934
"I all of a sudden saw another peak

01:00.685 --> 01:01.770
far away."

01:02.562 --> 01:05.273
"And I started planning my route."

01:05.356 --> 01:07.567
"How do I get up there to that peak?"

01:10.862 --> 01:12.739
In 1969,

01:13.239 --> 01:16.826
we found out that they were casting
Hercules in a movie.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.955
Oh my God. This is now my chance
to be another Reg Park.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.458
I was not ready for it.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.835
I didn't understand
half of what was in the script.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.507
It may not be entirely without merit,
but you wouldn't like it down there.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.925
Let me be the judge of that.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.095
I am tired of the same old faces,

01:35.178 --> 01:36.679
the same old things.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.473
I had never taken an acting lesson before.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.683
No man is superior to Hercules.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.478
-[voice actor] I'm Hercules.
-[captain] So you told me.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.396
[voice actor]
No mortal is superior to Hercules.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.817
They replaced my voice.
I couldn't speak English barely.

01:49.734 --> 01:54.239
They told me Americans want to hear
their idols talk like John Wayne,

01:54.322 --> 01:55.240
not like you.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.283
They changed my name

01:57.367 --> 02:00.286
from Arnold Schwarzenegger
to Arnold Strong.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.288
The movie came out,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.873
and it was

02:04.582 --> 02:05.959
not a hit at all.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.465
For five years, there was no offer

02:13.133 --> 02:14.134
for anything.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.096
So there was a lot of things
I had to learn,

02:18.179 --> 02:22.142
obstacles that I had to overcome,
including the biggest obstacle,

02:22.225 --> 02:25.270
when everyone says,
"No, it can't be done."

02:25.353 --> 02:26.688
[man] Why didn't you give up?

02:27.188 --> 02:30.275
Well, because my vision
didn't talk about giving up.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.318
My vision was climbing that mountain.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403

02:42.203 --> 02:43.913
[man] His artistry came

02:43.997 --> 02:46.833
from being really original
about everything that he did.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.919
It wasn't just about popularity.
He made it cool.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.424
The most remarkable American success story
of any I know of.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.260
We pushed each other.
I wanted to push him off a cliff.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.763
Unfortunately, I didn't find one,
so I had to live with him.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.724
Hasta la vista, baby.

03:06.686 --> 03:11.774
He's not a hollow version
of what one might think Arnold is.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.028
It's easy to diss him
as this over-the-hill '80s action star,

03:15.111 --> 03:16.446
but he's so much more than that.

Wow. Here we're gonna break in.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.362
It's a weird adjustment

03:57.445 --> 03:59.405
to go from bodybuilding

03:59.489 --> 04:00.740
to becoming an actor.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.168
What?

04:12.252 --> 04:13.878
Here or in the bedroom?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.214
Oh. Oh, here. Here. Here. Here.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.718
[Arnold] In the '70s,
the agents and the managers

04:20.802 --> 04:22.553
and the studio executives,

04:22.637 --> 04:26.349
they were very clear when they said to me,
"You're way too big."

04:26.849 --> 04:29.894
"You're too muscular.
This is not gonna play now."

04:29.978 --> 04:32.647
"Forget about that 250-pound
muscular body."

You think I'm funny, huh?
You think I'm funny!

04:40.321 --> 04:41.614
Well, you've gotta admit.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.034
I mean, when you do that
you look like some big ape or something.

04:45.118 --> 04:45.952
Stop that!

04:46.536 --> 04:47.912
"Let's just keep going."

04:47.996 --> 04:50.999
"Let's work on the substance.
Let's work on the acting ability."

04:51.082 --> 04:52.625
"Your moment will come."

04:52.709 --> 04:54.711
["Am I the Same Girl" plays]

05:01.134 --> 05:04.095
[Arnold] By that time,
I have now retired from bodybuilding.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.808
My friend Charles Gaines told me
that he's written this novel, Stay Hungry.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.894
That they're wanting to adapt it
to a screenplay.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.272
Stay Hungry was written for a bodybuilder.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.150
So I felt like
I'm in the right place at the right time.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.404
[man] In the novel,

05:21.487 --> 05:24.699
I go about defining
what it means to stay hungry.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.201
Never being satisfied with where you are.

05:27.285 --> 05:31.080
And the minute Arnold heard the phrase,
uh, he identified with it.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.125
It was his credo. It was the way he lived.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.627
No matter how many successes he's had,

05:36.711 --> 05:38.963
he's always hungry for something more.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.550
Bob Rafelson bought it to make a movie.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.428
Bob and I wrote the script together.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.139
For the part of Joe Santo,

05:48.222 --> 05:52.226
you had to be convincingly
a great bodybuilder.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.397
I said, "Look, there's only one guy
who's gonna be right for this part,

05:56.481 --> 05:58.524
and that's Arnold Schwarzenegger."

05:58.608 --> 06:01.444
Bob said, "That's not gonna work.
He needs a voice coach."

06:01.527 --> 06:03.738
"He's still got too thick an accent."

06:03.821 --> 06:06.866
Arnold made it his job to convince Bob

06:06.949 --> 06:08.785
that he was right for the part.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.747
[Arnold] Bob Rafelson just did
Five Easy Pieces and Easy Rider.

06:12.830 --> 06:16.459
And he did a lot of famous movies.
He was a really hot director.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.795
He did not guarantee me the role.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.799
He said, "In a few months from now,
let's do a test."

06:23.299 --> 06:25.802
"In the meantime,
go to this acting class."

06:25.885 --> 06:26.719
[phone rings]

06:26.803 --> 06:28.846
[man] I got a call from Bob Rafelson.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.431
And he said he has an actor

06:30.515 --> 06:33.393
who has never really acted
dramatically before.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.019
"Would you work with him?"

06:36.229 --> 06:38.022
For the first six weeks,

06:38.106 --> 06:41.984
I found out everything I could
about Arnold's life.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.362
"Tell me about your father."

06:44.946 --> 06:46.781
"Tell me about your mother."

06:47.740 --> 06:51.452
"Tell me how it was
growing up in Austria."

06:52.078 --> 06:54.414
"Don't just talk about it.
I want to know what you experience

06:54.497 --> 06:56.791
when you talk about it. How do you feel?"

06:57.875 --> 07:01.963
[Arnold] I realized that there are
certain things that I'm missing in me.

07:02.046 --> 07:06.384
I guarded myself so much,
there are no emotions really there.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.846
Or they're there and hidden away
and they have to be brought out

07:09.929 --> 07:11.931
in order to be a good actor.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.517
As soon as my emotions bother my training,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.394
I turn them off.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.065
I have to let my mind know
that it is okay to have them come out.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.696
When I went to the office of Bob Rafelson,

07:26.779 --> 07:30.074
in the middle of the scene,
Bob says, "My hair stood up."

07:31.033 --> 07:32.285
"I got goosebumps."

07:32.368 --> 07:33.619
"You're in."

07:44.714 --> 07:47.675
[Arnold] With the help
of Jeff Bridges and Sally Field,

07:47.758 --> 07:52.889
and with their intense interest to make me
shine and to make the movie work,

07:52.972 --> 07:55.683
they were at any given time
ready to rehearse with me.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.019
When are you gonna take that mask off?

07:58.686 --> 08:01.022
[Arnold] So when you work
with professionals like that,

08:01.105 --> 08:02.690
it makes you shine too.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.650
I don't like being too comfortable.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.529
Once you get used to it,
it's hard to give up.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.698
I'd rather stay hungry.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.368
I was very excited,

08:14.452 --> 08:17.997
but Stay Hungry is not gonna come out
for a while.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.665
Now what do we do?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.253
Two months later, George Butler
and Charles Gaines came to me

08:24.337 --> 08:27.840
and said they wanted to do a documentary
about the world of bodybuilding

08:27.924 --> 08:29.258
called Pumping Iron.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.345
This is it. First slate, take one.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.850

08:37.934 --> 08:38.893
And so here you were,

08:38.976 --> 08:41.687
ten people did work
with the documentary crew.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.356
Then the cameras were in my face.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.358
So therefore, you had to perform harder.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.237
Pumping Iron and Arnold together,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.739
is what made bodybuilding what it is.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.327
It was the first thing that
introduced bodybuilding

08:56.410 --> 08:57.662
to the general public.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.791
And it also made Arnold more accepted
in the movie industry.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.254
That crossed over where people saw me
not as the muscle freak,

09:06.337 --> 09:07.838
but as a personality.

-[Lou] I'll lose, Arnold. You're the best.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.863
They all kind of had the same rap.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.782
"We cannot sell you right now."

11:39.865 --> 11:41.492
"This is the '70s."

11:41.575 --> 11:44.161
"It's Dustin Hoffman that is in."

11:44.662 --> 11:46.914
"Al Pacino is in."

11:46.997 --> 11:50.334
"These are all little guys.
They're totally the opposite of you."

11:52.920 --> 11:55.256
Luckily, I didn't need the money.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.884
Joe Weider,
after he brought me to America,

11:58.968 --> 12:02.054
taught me real estate
is one of the greatest investments.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.807
I bought my first apartment building
in the '70s,

12:04.890 --> 12:06.350
when there was huge inflation.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.562
And I knew right away
what the potential was.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.858
Then I started buying office buildings
on Main Street in Santa Monica.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.111
I became a millionaire in the '70s

12:17.194 --> 12:19.405
before I ever took off
in the movie business.

12:19.488 --> 12:23.117
I did not have to take the bullshit roles,

12:23.200 --> 12:24.827
to be a character actor.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.580
"What the fuck?
I don't want to be a character actor."

12:27.663 --> 12:30.458
"I want to the leading man."

12:30.958 --> 12:32.376
"I want to be the star."

12:33.085 --> 12:36.255
Just because there is difficulty,
just because there's an obstacle…

12:36.338 --> 12:38.174
I don't care what it takes.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.677
I eventually will be up there with them.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.138
So I said to myself,

12:44.221 --> 12:47.016
"Those things that they say
are an obstacle,

12:47.099 --> 12:50.478
I'm gonna make them
not a liability but an asset."

12:52.605 --> 12:53.814
[applause]

12:55.316 --> 12:56.901
[reporter chuckles] Chevy!

12:56.984 --> 12:58.068
Are you all right?

12:58.152 --> 13:01.447
Partially live
from the West Side Tennis Club once again,

13:01.530 --> 13:04.784
this is the Robert F. Kennedy
pro celebrity tennis tournament.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.785
And boy, do I ache.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.496
[Arnold] Ethel Kennedy called me

13:09.246 --> 13:12.374
and said,
"Bobby Shriver brought your name up

13:12.458 --> 13:15.336
for the Robert F. Kennedy
tennis tournament."

13:15.419 --> 13:16.378
"You will be fantastic."

13:16.462 --> 13:19.215
"You have the right personality
to entertain everyone. Would you come?"

13:19.298 --> 13:23.844
I said, "Ethel, I've never had
a tennis racket in my hand."

13:24.470 --> 13:27.640
Everything I did,
I always double-checked with my publicist,

13:27.723 --> 13:30.226
who says, "Ethel Kennedy called you?"

13:30.309 --> 13:31.602
"Holy shit."

13:31.685 --> 13:33.187
"Go. Accept it."

13:35.356 --> 13:38.776
Before the actual tennis tournament,
there was a big party.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.529
All of the Kennedys were there.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.700
Eunice came up to me and says,
"Oh, hi, it's so good to have you here."

13:46.784 --> 13:49.745
"By the way,
this is my daughter, Maria Shriver."

13:50.621 --> 13:54.875
Then later on, when she says,
"So my daughter is really fond of you."

13:55.376 --> 13:57.503
I said, "Well, your daughter has
a really nice ass."

13:57.586 --> 13:59.380
I says, "I have to tell you that."

13:59.463 --> 14:00.965
Eunice said, "Thank you." [laughs]

14:01.966 --> 14:05.511
And then she walked away,
kind of like, "What the hell?"

14:05.594 --> 14:07.930
It was stupid to say.
I don't even know why I said it.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.809
Former Mr. Olympian, Mr. Universe,

14:11.892 --> 14:14.770
Arnold is now beset by frustration,

14:14.854 --> 14:17.690
tears the shirt off,
ready to renew the fight.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.901
When we are at
the actual tennis tournament,

14:20.985 --> 14:23.779
I could see
Maria looking at me the entire time.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.782
After it was over,
she and Caroline Kennedy

14:26.866 --> 14:28.909
came over and started chatting.

14:28.993 --> 14:33.205
Then Maria said, "I think you should come
to Hyannis Port with us tonight."

14:33.289 --> 14:38.085
I said, "The only thing is I have to
go back to get my clothes from the hotel."

14:38.168 --> 14:39.962
I said,
"I only have my tennis stuff here."

14:40.629 --> 14:43.299
"Are you crazy?
We all run around in shorts up there."

14:44.717 --> 14:47.970
We left that night
with a private plane to Hyannis Port.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.308
I then go with her to the beach,
and now we swim out in the ocean.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.062
We climb into the boat,
run around with the boat in the bay.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.149
And so this is how crazy it was.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.736
And it was all about,
kind of like, "Let's test this guy."

15:05.529 --> 15:07.406
The next morning, on Sunday,

15:07.489 --> 15:10.451
everyone was rushing into my room
and says, "Are you ready? Are you ready?"

15:10.534 --> 15:11.952
"We're going to church!"

15:12.036 --> 15:14.788
I said, "What do you mean to church?
I have no clothes."

15:15.664 --> 15:19.168
At the church, Rose Kennedy was sitting
there in the front.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.171
You had to dress up.
Everyone was decked out, because Rose…

15:22.254 --> 15:25.257
I'm sitting there like a schmuck
with my tennis shorts on,

15:25.341 --> 15:27.593
my tennis shoes,
and with Bobby Shriver's shirt.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.470
So at least I have a shirt on.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.808
I really fell in love with Maria.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.477
Not because she was a Kennedy,

15:36.560 --> 15:39.563
but she just had
the extraordinary personality.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.358
I could see that little rebel in her.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.362
I wanted to escape from my home,
from Austria.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.907
She also wanted to escape.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.993
So that was kind of the beginning

15:53.077 --> 15:54.244
of Maria and I.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.127
The next year, I finally found one agent
willing to represent me.

16:02.211 --> 16:06.298
I gave the whole thing you gave me
to my lawyer, and he's looking at it…

16:06.382 --> 16:09.802
He told me, "You have an interview
with Dino De Laurentis."

16:09.885 --> 16:12.471
I mean,
he's the guy that has made 500 movies.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.640
He has Academy Awards and Golden Globes,

16:14.723 --> 16:16.266
so he was a real big shot.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.269
We went to his office,
and the first thing I see

16:19.353 --> 16:20.896
is this little guy

16:20.980 --> 16:23.232
sitting behind his massive desk.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.818
As he got up from his chair,
he didn't get much taller,

16:25.901 --> 16:28.153
and I realized he was really little.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.907
So I said, "Why does a little guy
need such a big desk?"

16:32.908 --> 16:34.868
And he immediately went nuts.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.370
"Ah!"

16:36.453 --> 16:39.289
"I cannot use you. You have an accent."

16:39.373 --> 16:43.544
"That's funny you say that," I said,
"because you have an accent too."

16:43.627 --> 16:44.878
"I barely can understand you."

16:45.462 --> 16:47.589
"Ah. Get him out of here."

16:48.090 --> 16:50.175
The door barely closes.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.553
My agent starts screaming at me.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.054
"Look at this, Arnold."

16:54.138 --> 16:58.392
"It was one minute and forty seconds."

16:59.018 --> 17:02.813
"It was the fastest meeting
I've ever had in Hollywood."

17:02.896 --> 17:05.566
"You had to open up your mouth."

17:07.234 --> 17:08.360
Later that year,

17:08.444 --> 17:11.613
Ed Pressman bought the rights
for Conan the Barbarian

17:11.697 --> 17:14.950
and fell in love with me
after having seen Pumping Iron.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.786
He felt that
I have the perfect personality

17:17.870 --> 17:19.621
for playing Conan.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.000
Ed Pressman asked Dino De Laurentis
to produce the movie.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.004
Dino right away said, "I cannot use him."

17:27.087 --> 17:28.422
"He is a Nazi!"

17:28.505 --> 17:29.882
"I don't like him."

17:29.965 --> 17:34.094
So Ed Pressman had no idea
what this was all about.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.682
Luckily,
before they threw me off the project

17:39.224 --> 17:41.602
they hired now the director John Milius.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.563
And he says, "Dino doesn't like you."

17:44.646 --> 17:46.148
I said, "I know he doesn't like me."

17:46.231 --> 17:49.109
He says, "Don't worry about it.
I will straighten it out."

17:49.193 --> 17:51.195
And John Milius was a tough guy.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.907
He goes to meetings with a .45 loaded,

17:54.990 --> 17:57.910
puts it on the desk when he
starts talking to studio executives.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.412
Dino did not want to deal with him at all.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.956
He thought that Milius was crazy.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.752
Then Milius says, "I'm not gonna do
the movie without Arnold."

18:06.835 --> 18:08.378
"He's gonna be Conan."

18:08.462 --> 18:10.464
[suspenseful music plays]

18:18.263 --> 18:19.973
[Arnold] The shoot was tough.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.558
Milius was crazy.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.562
He wanted you to be out there in the cold,

18:25.646 --> 18:26.980
freezing your ass off.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.400
The theme of the movie is suffering.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.819
He loved that.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.655
[Milius] One of the things
I've learned to be is ruthless.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.864
Long after you're gone,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.867
they'll decide whether you were
any good or not, you know?

18:38.951 --> 18:43.205
[Arnold] I did all my own stunts.
There was no one around with the body.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.749
So therefore,
I had to do everything myself.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.627
[grunts]

18:48.710 --> 18:49.670
[dog barking]

18:53.715 --> 18:55.884
[groaning]

18:55.968 --> 18:57.094
God dammit.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.846
It was fine the first take.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.307
Then we did a second take.
Third take, fourth take.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.102
And eventually, I was now really bleeding.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.770
[yells]

19:07.980 --> 19:09.523
[grunting]

19:10.941 --> 19:14.361
I was always a fanatic about preparation.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.698
No matter how many reps,
no matter what it takes,

19:17.781 --> 19:20.075
you don't go to the set unprepared.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.369
That's all you'll ever need.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.747
Five in the morning,
we met and did samurai training,

19:25.831 --> 19:27.624
grappling training, broadswords

19:27.708 --> 19:31.003
so that I can really handle
and understand the movement.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.504
[screams]

19:34.006 --> 19:35.883
[Arnold] Hours of horseback riding,

19:35.966 --> 19:38.844
because I wanted to feel
one with the horse.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.723
And eventually,
Dino De Laurentis came to the set.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.017
He comes up the steps.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.435
[imitates footsteps]

19:46.518 --> 19:47.728
Right up to me.

19:47.811 --> 19:51.481
And he says to me,
"Schwarzenegger, you're Conan."

19:52.357 --> 19:53.275
Ah.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.777
Turned around… [imitates footsteps]
7down again.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.239
I remember Milius running over to me,

19:59.323 --> 20:00.532
giving me a big hug,

20:00.616 --> 20:03.702
and saying, "Yes! He loves you!"

20:03.785 --> 20:06.788
"You hear what he said?"
I said, "He said I'm Conan. I know that."

20:07.748 --> 20:10.876
"This is, like, the best compliment
you could ever get. You are Conan!"

20:10.959 --> 20:12.377
"You are the character."

20:12.461 --> 20:14.588
["That's Good" plays]

20:14.671 --> 20:17.633
And a former Mr. Universe,
who's built like a Mack truck,

20:17.716 --> 20:20.260
stars in a new movie, Conan the Barbarian.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.099
-[woman] What's the film about?
-It's a fantasy movie.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.353
It's an adventure movie
that takes place in an imaginary time.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.105
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan le Barbare.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.691
[Arnold] I went to every country
in the world to promote this,

20:34.775 --> 20:35.817
because I wanted to show

20:35.901 --> 20:38.695
that I'm now Arnold the actor,
not Arnold the bodybuilder.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.448
♪ Everybody, it's a good thing… ♪

20:41.531 --> 20:43.742
[Arnold] And it worked
because I established myself

20:43.825 --> 20:45.994
as an international actor.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.706
Conan made 90 million dollars worldwide.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.961
I'd proven to the naysayers
that a foreigner with an accent

20:54.044 --> 20:57.881
and with a 240-pound body
can actually become a leading man

20:57.965 --> 21:00.842
and have the sales worldwide.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.344
♪ A monumental good thing ♪

21:02.427 --> 21:03.428
So fuck them all.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.559
[wind blowing]

21:15.148 --> 21:18.068
[Arnold] I've had this house now
for more than 25 years.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.863
This is a combination
of Austria and America.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.782
It's the Austrian warmth

21:24.491 --> 21:26.910
and it is the American size.

21:26.994 --> 21:27.953
Big!

21:28.036 --> 21:30.622
Too big is not big enough.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.748
That's the idea.

21:33.667 --> 21:37.462
When I came here in the '60s and '70s,

21:37.546 --> 21:38.797
America had problems.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.342
The Manson murders
and protests against the war.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.052
Hippies were rising up.

21:44.678 --> 21:48.640
An immigrant like myself
doesn't look at any of those things.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.600
I'm going to the shining city on a hill.

21:51.727 --> 21:55.355
Yes, it maybe has its faults
and awful stuff,

21:55.439 --> 21:56.815
but I don't see that.

21:58.525 --> 22:02.821
To go and be able to step
from one world to the next,

22:03.405 --> 22:06.074
from bodybuilding
to show business and acting…

22:06.158 --> 22:07.576
Only in America.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.251
I fell in love with America because I saw

22:16.335 --> 22:18.879
a black-and-white film in school.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.049
High rises of New York.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.760
There was the Golden Gate Bridge.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.512
Everything looked just gigantic and big,

22:27.596 --> 22:29.514
and I wanted to be part of that.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.977
I love this American music.
I love this American politician.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.229
It was all America, America, America.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.817
I applied for the citizenship.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.403
Of course, you have to pass a test.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.490
I practiced for it. I passed it.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.452
In 1983, I became a citizen.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.538
I was waiting for this moment
for a long time.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.290
Today I'm finally an American citizen,

23:05.884 --> 23:07.219
to become an American.

And then Ronald Reagan was elected,

It was very important to have

You are the machine."

"Well, think about it."

I thought for three days,
then I called him back

when he walked home.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.555
And I said to her,

34:17.638 --> 34:20.767
"The boats are out there.
I'll take you on a little boat ride."

34:21.517 --> 34:25.438
When we were in the middle of the lake,
I then pulled out the ring

34:25.521 --> 34:27.148
and I proposed to her.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.320
I pulled off the surprise.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.114
[indistinct chatter]

34:36.115 --> 34:37.867
The wedding was in Hyannis Port

34:37.950 --> 34:41.496
at the same church
where I first met Maria's grandmother,

34:41.579 --> 34:42.663
Rose Kennedy.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.000
It was the biggest wedding
that I've ever been to.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.461
At least 500 people were there.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.797
I knew ten percent.

34:51.631 --> 34:53.174
[woman] How do I love thee?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.259
Let me count the ways.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.261
I love thee

34:57.345 --> 34:58.679
with the breath,

34:59.430 --> 35:02.058
smiles, and tears

35:02.141 --> 35:03.976
of all my life.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.686
-[Maria] I, Maria…
-[Arnold] I, Arnold…

35:05.770 --> 35:08.189
-[Maria] Take you, Arnold…
-[Arnold] Take you, Maria…

35:08.272 --> 35:11.109
[both] In good times and bad,
in sickness and in health,

35:11.692 --> 35:12.777
I will love you…

35:12.860 --> 35:14.862
-[Arnold] And honor you…
-All the days of my life.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.406
Now what?

35:17.490 --> 35:18.866
You can kiss the bride.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.493
[applause]

35:23.287 --> 35:25.581
[joyful music plays]

35:26.415 --> 35:28.417
[cheering]

35:52.441 --> 35:55.862
[Arnold] I always thought
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch alive.

35:55.945 --> 36:00.199
I'm so fortunate
that I'm successful in the movie business

36:00.825 --> 36:02.618
and in my personal life.

36:02.702 --> 36:06.414
There's very few people that can say
they're successful in both.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.669
And then, becoming a father

36:11.752 --> 36:13.421
is a whole new ballgame.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.382
People talk about it a lot of times,
but you have no understanding

36:16.465 --> 36:17.967
what they're talking about.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.802
When Katherine was born,

36:19.886 --> 36:22.763
I was in there
with tears running down the eyes.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.974
I was just so emotional

36:25.725 --> 36:27.018
about this life

36:27.101 --> 36:29.270
that I have just created with Maria.

36:29.353 --> 36:33.274
And you realize
this is a whole other world.

36:33.983 --> 36:38.070
And so it was just staggering
what kind of great joy it brought to us.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.865
And, kind of, great motivation

36:40.948 --> 36:42.867
to continue on with your career.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.745
But now, you have to,
kind of, think about this.

36:49.790 --> 36:54.253
I always liked when you read a quote
and you say to yourself,

36:54.337 --> 36:56.505
"This is something
that I could have said."

36:57.006 --> 37:01.886
Ted Turner's "Early to bed, early to rise,
work like hell and advertise,"

37:02.386 --> 37:03.930
was one of those quotes.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.975
[curious music plays]

37:15.900 --> 37:18.569
[man] The first time I bumped into Arnold,

37:18.653 --> 37:21.489
we were both in Colorado skiing.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.991
He was stepping out of the Snowmass Club.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.577
He just suddenly stopped,
and he pointed at me.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.621
"You're that Ghostbusters guy,
aren't you?"

37:28.704 --> 37:31.540
I said, "Yeah, that's my movie."

37:31.624 --> 37:33.626
He said,
"You know, I could be a ghostbuster."

37:34.335 --> 37:37.255
That was such a clever way
for him to let me know,

37:37.338 --> 37:39.507
"I can do comedy.
It's not just action stuff."

37:40.341 --> 37:43.511
We went out to dinner,
and he caught me off guard.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.179
He spoke very well,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.391
and his intelligence
and humor came through.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.061
I said,
"We'll make a movie one day together."

37:53.521 --> 37:57.525
Later on, Danny DeVito and I
were at some Disney studio screening,

37:58.067 --> 38:01.779
and something about seeing those two guys
within a week of each other

38:01.862 --> 38:05.574
put that idea in my head
that they might be the perfect couple

38:05.658 --> 38:06.659
in a movie.

38:07.868 --> 38:11.247
[Danny] Totally out of the blue,
I got a phone call from Ivan Reitman.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.208
He says, "How about you
and Arnold Schwarzenegger being brothers

38:14.292 --> 38:15.293
in this movie Twins?"

38:15.376 --> 38:18.087
I said,
"Oh, Jesus, this is, like, amazing idea."

38:19.171 --> 38:21.132
I was in New York with my kids.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.051
I was in front of a hotel,
and I was getting out of a car,

38:24.135 --> 38:27.430
and I was struggling with the bags,
and I felt a hand on my shoulder

38:27.513 --> 38:30.391
and then grab the bag,
and I thought it was the doorman.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.102
And I turn around,
and there's Schwarzenegger.

38:33.185 --> 38:36.355
"Yo, Danny." And I said,
"Oh, Arnold! Thank you!"

38:36.439 --> 38:38.316
So that was our first meeting.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.027
For this really to work,

38:41.110 --> 38:44.697
you had to believe in the truth
of the story, as absurd as it is.

38:46.907 --> 38:50.161
-[Arnold in Twins] I have a brother?
-[man] Yeah.

38:51.787 --> 38:54.415
You were sent to an orphanage
in Los Angeles.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.792
[Reitman] I felt playing
a much more naive,

38:56.876 --> 39:00.254
much more new-to-the-world character
could be effective.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.840
He's probably just like me!

39:04.342 --> 39:05.926
[Reitman] We wrote it that way,

39:06.010 --> 39:11.098
and part of my job as the director
is to take advantage of everything you can

39:11.182 --> 39:14.060
exposing the deeper Arnold.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.731
I particularly did not want
the one-liners as an approach.

39:18.814 --> 39:21.400
He always thought
that the way to deliver the line is

39:21.484 --> 39:24.362
to just pitch it in a physical way,

39:24.445 --> 39:28.282
where really the great comedians
underplay things as much as possible.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.452
I always told writers
they have to write for me.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.829
Remember, Sully,
when I promised to kill you last?

39:33.913 --> 39:35.581
That's right, Matrix, you did.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.166
I lied.

39:37.249 --> 39:42.088
The lines that I'm famous for,
that's not how you talk in a comedy.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.549
It was one of those interesting switches
that you had to make,

39:45.633 --> 39:49.178
where something worked for you,
the more you had to work to get rid of it.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.935
Immediately, bingo.

39:56.018 --> 39:57.103
We kind of fit.

39:57.603 --> 40:00.606
My name is Julius
and I am your twin brother.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.068
Oh, obviously!

40:04.151 --> 40:06.904
The moment I sat down,
I thought I was looking into a mirror!

40:07.822 --> 40:09.448
We are not identical twins.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.991
["Money" plays]

40:11.075 --> 40:14.870
[Danny] And then we do the whole
looking in the mirror kind of thing.

40:21.877 --> 40:26.882
Twins was actually the first movie
that made over $100,000,000 for me

40:26.966 --> 40:28.050
at the box office.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.679
♪ The best things in life are free ♪

40:32.596 --> 40:35.141
♪ But you can give them
To the birds and bees ♪

40:35.224 --> 40:37.184
♪ I want money… ♪

40:37.268 --> 40:39.895
[Danny] Everybody's got
that movie on their shelf.

40:39.979 --> 40:44.233
At least, my bank account says that
everybody's got that movie on their shelf.

40:46.402 --> 40:47.945
♪ That's what I want… ♪

40:48.904 --> 40:53.868
I met Arnold at a Halloween party.
I grew up in an Austrian family,

40:53.951 --> 40:56.412
and so we connected on skiing

40:56.495 --> 40:59.290
and Wiener schnitzel and lederhosen.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.043
He said, "You know, I'm starting
to make a lot of money."

41:03.127 --> 41:05.254
"I wanna do more than real estate."

41:05.337 --> 41:08.632
"I'd like you to manage my money.
Would you help do deals?"

41:08.716 --> 41:11.051
[laughing]

41:11.135 --> 41:13.512
[speaking Japanese]

41:15.556 --> 41:17.558
[speaking Japanese]

41:20.978 --> 41:22.271
[man] Tonight, the wait is over.

41:22.354 --> 41:24.899
Planet Hollywood is open
in our part of the globe.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.694
[Wachter] His influence
in the mid '80s to 2000s

41:28.777 --> 41:30.070
was tremendous.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.781
He helped start the cigar boom.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.867
Suddenly, cigars became this huge thing.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.577
He was the biggest movie star
in the world.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.662
And he was always filmed with a cigar.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.958
The big watches. Nobody wore big watches.

41:43.542 --> 41:47.838
The Hummers. Arnold had been involved
in developing the first commercial Hummer.

41:47.922 --> 41:51.342
The whole idea of America
going to bigger cars, SUVs,

41:51.425 --> 41:52.510
and all that stuff,

41:52.593 --> 41:54.261
that's all part of that.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.096
That's his brand.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.599
[Arnold] I am a stud. I am ballsy.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.310
I smoke my stogie anywhere I want.

42:01.393 --> 42:04.355
I don't have to find
a hideout place like you.

42:04.438 --> 42:05.481
[laughs]

42:06.649 --> 42:09.276
It's the Schmäh.
It's the Schmäh, right there.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.694
Everything's bullshit.

42:10.778 --> 42:11.904
[laughs]

42:11.987 --> 42:14.532
[Arnold] To sell things,
you have to have the Schmäh.

42:15.241 --> 42:18.827
The only way I could translate it really
is like "bullshit," right?

42:18.911 --> 42:20.913
That in America, we just say bullshit.

42:20.996 --> 42:24.124
When you go out and promote a movie,
"The pump is better than coming."

42:24.208 --> 42:25.417
It's all the Schmäh.

42:32.299 --> 42:36.637
I just always liked big,
monster military vehicles.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.848
And driving around with a Hummer,
then I have a tank.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.601
To drive a truck like that,
you gotta have a stogie in your mouth,

42:42.685 --> 42:45.062
because then the whole thing
is more ballsy.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.064
It's just the Schmäh.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.442
[engine revs]

42:56.198 --> 42:58.784
-Terminator 2. He's back.
-That's right.

42:59.368 --> 43:03.664
[Arnold] Whenever you do a sequel,
you cannot just do the same story.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.751
In Terminator 1, I was this evil machine

43:07.835 --> 43:10.629
that just destroyed anyone
and everyone that came in my path.

43:11.630 --> 43:12.881
And in the second one,

43:12.965 --> 43:14.842
I say, "I swear…"

43:14.925 --> 43:16.343
I will not kill anyone.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.931
[Cameron] At first,
Arnold was absolutely against the idea.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.851
Arnold and I were gonna meet
and talk about the script.

43:23.934 --> 43:28.439
So I sit down. I could see
he's not his usual cheerful self.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.733
I go, "What's the matter?
You didn't like it."

43:30.816 --> 43:31.900
He goes, "Jim."

43:34.153 --> 43:35.571
"I don't kill anybody."

43:36.113 --> 43:37.948
Come with me if you want to live.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.743
[Cameron] "Now you're the good guy,
the defender, the protector."

43:40.826 --> 43:43.787
He said, "Okay. All right."

43:43.871 --> 43:45.748
"Can I shoot them in the leg?"

43:45.831 --> 43:48.375
I said, "Yeah, let's just shoot them
in the leg. How's that?"

43:48.459 --> 43:50.419
He goes, "No, that's good."

43:51.545 --> 43:52.630
[screams]

43:53.380 --> 43:55.841
-What the hell are you doing?
-He'll live.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.595
[Arnold] A few days before we start,
Jim Cameron says,

43:59.678 --> 44:01.597
"Let's all get together
and have a nice dinner."

44:01.680 --> 44:04.475
Linda comes in
and she takes her sweater off,

44:04.558 --> 44:06.393
and I'm looking at her arms.

44:06.477 --> 44:09.229
Veins on the biceps

44:09.313 --> 44:10.981
and then the triceps.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.984
Everything was like a bodybuilder,
except miniature.

44:14.068 --> 44:17.363
I do remember the fierce pride that I had

44:17.446 --> 44:19.114
to show to Arnold.

44:19.198 --> 44:22.076
[Arnold] I said,
"I can't believe that son of a bitch

44:22.159 --> 44:24.078
is fucking more cut than me."

44:24.745 --> 44:28.415
[Cameron] When I made a film with Arnold,
I had him speak to the cast.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.460
Actors usually try to share a little truth

44:31.543 --> 44:33.087
of the acting process.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.380
Arnold says forget all that.

44:34.463 --> 44:35.547
He saw

44:35.631 --> 44:39.718
half the job was performing the film
and half the job was promoting the film.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.428
[Arnold] You have to be involved yourself.

44:41.512 --> 44:45.099
You have to go in there and just say,
"Here's why you should see this movie."

44:45.182 --> 44:47.434
It doesn't matter
if the other stars say no,

44:47.518 --> 44:49.186
because they're spoiled brats.

44:49.269 --> 44:52.231
"I am a star. I don't sell movies."

44:52.314 --> 44:54.692
"You have to sell the movie.
I am the artist."

44:54.775 --> 44:56.360
Bullshit. You have to sell everything.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.445
No matter what you do in life,
you have to sell it.

44:59.029 --> 45:02.116
And the movie didn't make, like,
$50,000,000 like the first one.

45:02.199 --> 45:06.495
It made over $200,000,000 domestically.
It became the highest-grossing movie.

45:06.578 --> 45:09.665
[man] Arnold Schwarzenegger terminated
his box office competition.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.709
[man 2] Why does Arnold want
to play a good cyborg?

45:11.792 --> 45:13.168
[woman] I think there will be a day

45:13.252 --> 45:15.337
you'll see him running
for the Senate in California,

45:15.421 --> 45:17.297
and he didn't want to ruin it
by turning around

45:17.381 --> 45:20.092
and being the bad guy he was back in 1984.

45:20.175 --> 45:22.761
And it's just a tiny theory,
but that's mine.

45:22.845 --> 45:24.221
-You heard it here first.
-Yes.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.640
There probably isn't a person
anywhere on the planet

45:26.724 --> 45:29.893
who doesn't know who
that man behind the screen is.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.563
He's the number one
box office star in the world.

45:32.646 --> 45:36.567
Today, his latest film opened.
It's called Last Action Hero.

45:36.650 --> 45:39.486
Please give it up
for Arnold Schwarzenegger.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.946
[cheering and applause]

45:41.029 --> 45:43.991
[Arnold] When Last Action Hero came out,

45:44.074 --> 45:48.162
I had reached my peak after Terminator 2,

45:48.245 --> 45:52.332

of the year worldwide.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.792
Not just in America, but worldwide.

45:57.421 --> 46:01.049
So at that point, it was everyone
was gunning to take me down.

46:01.592 --> 46:05.095
[man] Not everyone is taking
to Arnold Schwarzenegger's wild new movie,

46:05.179 --> 46:06.638

46:07.890 --> 46:09.266

46:09.349 --> 46:12.686
[man] In fact, some of the reviews
have been downright nasty.

46:12.770 --> 46:16.482
Last Action Hero flies
uncommonly close to turkeydom.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.151
[Arnold] I cannot tell you

46:19.777 --> 46:23.864
how upset that I was.

46:23.947 --> 46:25.240
It hurts you.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.409
It hurts your feelings. It's embarrassing.

46:27.493 --> 46:30.162
You get embarrassed
when you watch the box office.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.875
[Cameron] I remember calling Arnold
on Saturday morning,

46:34.958 --> 46:36.877
and I hadn't really read the news.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.213
I said, "How'd the picture open?"

46:39.797 --> 46:40.714
He said…

46:40.798 --> 46:42.090
[imitation Arnold] …"Terrible."

46:42.674 --> 46:45.594
And he sounded like he was,
like, in bed crying.

46:45.677 --> 46:48.972
He took it as, like,
a deep blow to his brand.

46:49.056 --> 46:50.724
I think it really shook him.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.521
I said, "What are you gonna do?"

46:56.021 --> 46:57.105
He says,

46:57.189 --> 47:00.275
"I'm just gonna hang out by myself."
[laughs]

47:00.359 --> 47:03.028
That's the only time
I've ever heard him down.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.781
[Arnold] I didn't want
to see anyone for a week,

47:06.281 --> 47:08.408
but you keep plodding along.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.661
And my mother-in-law
also said this all the time,

47:10.744 --> 47:13.080
she says, "Let's just move forward.
Let's just move forward."

47:13.163 --> 47:14.748
"Let's go. Move. Move. Move. Move."

47:14.832 --> 47:16.458
It's a great message.

47:17.417 --> 47:19.419
After Last Action Hero came out,

47:19.920 --> 47:21.338
Bobby Shriver called me.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.465
He says, "You should see La Totale!"

47:23.549 --> 47:25.300
A little French movie that no one saw.

47:25.384 --> 47:27.511
It was very entertaining
and very well done.

47:27.594 --> 47:30.222
And the concept was
so refreshing and so new.

47:30.305 --> 47:32.808
So I called Jim Cameron,
and I said… I said to him, "Jim."

47:32.891 --> 47:34.601
"You gotta see this film."

47:34.685 --> 47:37.354
Arnold's bringing me
a project that he believes in.

47:37.437 --> 47:38.939
He'd never done that before.

47:39.022 --> 47:40.774
I thought we could have fun with comedy.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.735
I knew Arnold had done comedy.
He had a great sense of humor.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.571
And that it would be a good action film.

47:46.071 --> 47:50.617
He said, "Let's make it big."
And I said, "Yeah, let's make it big."

47:50.701 --> 47:52.911
May I see your invitation, please?

47:52.995 --> 47:55.038
Sure, here's my invitation.

47:59.751 --> 48:04.298
The phone in my bedroom rang,
and I heard this…

48:04.882 --> 48:06.925
"Hi, Jamie. It's James Cameron."

48:07.009 --> 48:10.470
"I've written a movie
for you and Arnold Schwarzenegger."

48:13.682 --> 48:16.977
Plumber called. He says
he has to dig under the slab or something.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.937
It's going to cost $600.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.230
Mmm, that's okay.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.566
Well, it's not okay. It's extortion.

48:23.108 --> 48:24.610
So what did you tell him?

48:24.693 --> 48:27.529
I slept with him
and he said he'd knock off $100.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.115
That's good thinking. Bye, Honey.

48:32.743 --> 48:37.748
[Jaime] Arnold is incredibly generous
to his crew and his cast.

48:38.415 --> 48:40.626
His door is open all day long.

48:41.501 --> 48:43.921
Maria was there. The kids were there.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.088
It was lovely.

48:45.839 --> 48:48.383
I was as free in that performance

49:05.025 --> 49:06.234
And the phone rang.

49:07.402 --> 49:08.570
It was Jim Cameron,

49:09.279 --> 49:11.281
and he said, "I went to Arnold,

49:11.365 --> 49:12.991
and asked him

49:13.075 --> 49:17.245
if I could put your name
above the title of the movie."

49:18.538 --> 49:23.085

on lawyers and agents

49:23.168 --> 49:24.795

49:24.878 --> 49:26.546
It's a big business.

With all of his big bravado and ego

49:30.258 --> 49:32.594
and all the things that have made him,

49:32.678 --> 49:34.805
he had the grace

49:35.514 --> 49:37.140
to make some room for me.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.435
It was a very moving moment for me,

49:40.519 --> 49:43.271
and that movie,
of course, changed my life.

When my brother passed away,
and when my dad passed away,

50:53.592 --> 50:56.094
then I was the only one
left in the family.

50:56.178 --> 50:59.806
So now I had to really shift gears
and think much more about my mother.

51:02.017 --> 51:06.104
In 1974, she stayed with me
for a few weeks and she loved it.

51:07.898 --> 51:11.151
And I started to really appreciate
my mother much more,

51:11.234 --> 51:13.945
hanging out with her
and having a good time.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.906
She went on every movie set.

51:18.366 --> 51:19.910
She took pictures on the movie set.

51:19.993 --> 51:22.954
She made her photo albums,
took it home to Austria,

51:23.038 --> 51:25.290
and then she showed off over there
with her friends.

51:25.373 --> 51:26.792
Very, very proud of me.

51:28.335 --> 51:32.047
In Austria, there's two things

About your finances

51:35.842 --> 51:38.136
and about your health problems.

51:41.848 --> 51:43.725
In 1997,

51:44.643 --> 51:47.979
after I was finished
with Batman and Robin,

51:48.814 --> 51:51.483
my mother was staying with us.

51:52.150 --> 51:53.360
She got up in the morning,

51:53.443 --> 51:55.737
and Maria said,
"Arnold is in the hospital."

51:55.821 --> 51:57.489
"He's having heart surgery."

51:58.073 --> 52:00.075
And my mother said, "What?"

52:07.332 --> 52:09.292
After I woke up from the surgery,

52:09.376 --> 52:12.712
the doctor sat down in my bed
and held my hand.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.674
He says, "Arnold, I'm so sorry."

52:16.508 --> 52:17.717
"It didn't work."

"We have to have
another surgery right away."

52:28.854 --> 52:31.815
They started preparing me
for the second surgery.

52:33.316 --> 52:34.401
I said to myself,

52:35.110 --> 52:36.570
"What the hell is going on here?"

52:36.653 --> 52:38.572
"No one has given me any anesthesia yet,

52:38.655 --> 52:40.907
and the guy is standing here
with the knife."

52:41.491 --> 52:43.118
The doctor said to me,

52:43.201 --> 52:47.038
"We want to wait until the last second.
I don't want to lose you."

52:49.457 --> 52:51.918
I said to myself, "What?"

52:52.919 --> 52:56.590
Then, they did give me the anesthesia,
and I wiped out.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.552
It was kind of touch and go.

53:01.678 --> 53:04.431
Sixteen hours later, I woke up again.

53:04.514 --> 53:06.141
The surgery was successful.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.478
My mother came into the hospital

53:10.562 --> 53:12.939
and gave me a lot of hell
for not telling her,

53:13.023 --> 53:15.525
and "How could you do this to me?
I'm your mother."

53:15.609 --> 53:17.819
"You're supposed to be able
to tell me anything."

53:17.903 --> 53:19.613
It was just too much for her.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.538
A year later,

53:28.622 --> 53:29.873
I got a phone call

Yeah, so…

53:42.636 --> 53:44.429
My mother passed away

53:44.512 --> 53:46.890
from the same valve problem that I had.

53:48.099 --> 53:50.435
She refused the surgery.

53:51.269 --> 53:53.688
She just always said, "If God wants me,

53:54.522 --> 53:55.523
he can have me."

53:57.776 --> 54:01.029
I immediately felt this sense of,
"Well, now what?"

54:02.405 --> 54:05.867
It was so deep inside me
that I never thought about it,

54:05.951 --> 54:09.871

to look for approval from my mother.

[woman] Ladies and gentlemen,
Arnold Schwarzenegger!

58:01.352 --> 58:03.771
[Cameron] I lost any skepticism

58:03.855 --> 58:05.732
to put any limits on him.

[cheering]

58:14.115 --> 58:17.368
[Wachter] His whole life, you could see
he was heading towards something

58:17.452 --> 58:19.245
so much bigger.

I believe politics was his destiny.

58:23.625 --> 58:26.085
Everything else was a warm-up act.

58:26.753 --> 58:30.048
[woman] He understood
the political system itself is the box,

58:30.131 --> 58:31.883
and he blew up the box.

58:31.966 --> 58:35.678
We are here,
ladies and gentlemen, to clean house.

58:38.973 --> 58:40.308
[Arnold] You see this peak?

58:40.934 --> 58:42.143
I gotta climb this.

No matter what it takes,

58:45.271 --> 58:46.606
