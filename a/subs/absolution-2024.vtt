WEBVTT

02:10.214 --> 02:13.259
<i>I was, uh,
I was about nine or ten.</i>

02:14.718 --> 02:16.387
<i>My old man made me...</i>

02:17.179 --> 02:19.598
<i>fight this older kid
in the neighborhood.</i>

02:21.350 --> 02:22.434
<i>He said I was a pussy.</i>

02:24.186 --> 02:26.771
<i>And if I didn't want
to be a pussy my whole life,</i>

02:26.772 --> 02:29.775
<i>I needed to kick this kid's ass.</i>

02:34.572 --> 02:35.573
<i>So...</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:37.575
<i>I beat the kid up.</i>

02:42.413 --> 02:43.663
<i>Beat him to a pulp.</i>

03:05.394 --> 03:08.147
<i>He told me I might not
be a pussy, after all.</i>

03:57.029 --> 04:00.658
Got some product coming in
from New York the next few days.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.285
Need a nice white face
to pick it up and deliver it

04:04.286 --> 04:06.455
- when the time comes.
- What kind of product?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.543
Okay.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.297
Look, I need to know
what the fuck we're bringing up.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.883
No, you ain't fixing
to ask me specifics

04:18.884 --> 04:21.095
about my product, are you, <i>ese?</i>

04:23.514 --> 04:24.764
Didn't mean to offend you.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.599
No, no, don't tell me
what you meant.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.435
I fucking heard your ass.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.607
Okay. Okay.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.567
I'm sorry.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.112
Now,
don't come in here acting like

04:39.113 --> 04:41.406
you've got some
fucking weight behind your ass.

04:41.407 --> 04:42.740
You know the fucking drill.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.827
You either take the fucking job
or you're not.

04:49.415 --> 04:50.499
How's that number?

04:51.834 --> 04:52.918
Looks about right.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.920
One of these days
the FBI...

05:07.599 --> 05:09.309
The fuck did you get that relic?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.062
I inherited him from my old man.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.065
A fucking throwback,
right there.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.693
Does it talk?

05:18.444 --> 05:20.779
This dude was the real
deal back in the day, man.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.032
Was ain't is, homes.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.326
Homie past his sell-by date.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.122
Somebody tell this fuckpig

05:31.123 --> 05:33.292
that if he don't stop
staring at me,

05:33.959 --> 05:35.835
I'm gonna have
to break his shoulders.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.796
In the present tense.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.676
Oh, whoa, whoa.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.845
Take it easy, man.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.973
That motherfucker
still got some game, huh.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.684
I like him.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.312
So we got a deal or what?

05:55.522 --> 05:56.648
Deal.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.783
Dude, you really need
to not be saying shit like that.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.367
Do you know who those guys are?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.245
Somebody
had to say something.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.289
Never seen anyone
backpedal so fast.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.959
Hey!
Who's the fucking boss here?

06:18.629 --> 06:20.422
You want
to be a boss one day,

06:21.090 --> 06:23.008
you got to start
acting like one.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.863
You really need that
to find your way home?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.740
No, but my nav system

06:47.741 --> 06:49.743
has real-time
traffic pattern algorithms.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.000
Oh, you can't smoke in here.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.632
Algorithms... Algorithms...

07:05.801 --> 07:08.220
That blow's gonna kill you,
you know that?

07:10.973 --> 07:12.558
You think I'm a tool, don't ya?

07:14.309 --> 07:16.812
No, kid.
I don't think you're a tool.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.064
You're just green is all.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.293
There he is.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.175
So, the kid bargained
a good price?

07:47.843 --> 07:51.763
Uh, he got an okay price.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.683
So, he shit the bed?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.478
I would have been
scared too at his age, boss.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.023
You know, when he managed
to get his degree from BC,

08:02.024 --> 08:03.650
I wanted him
to go to law school.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.443
He had other ideas.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.654
He wants to be a tough guy,
like you.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.074
You know, he set this
whole deal up himself.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.745
He's trying to prove
to everybody he's a shot-caller.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.623
What do you think?

08:18.624 --> 08:20.458
That ain't none of my business.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.877
I'm not sure he's ever
gonna be ready, you know?

08:22.878 --> 08:25.880
He's just not cut out for it,
like you and me.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.467
He just needs some time,
Mister...

08:33.931 --> 08:35.849
You forget
my fucking name again?

08:37.392 --> 08:39.228
You forget my fucking name?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.022
I...

08:43.023 --> 08:45.066
I've been having
some trouble sleeping,

08:45.067 --> 08:46.652
I get these headaches.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.569
All right.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.031
Just make sure the kid
doesn't fuck this one up.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.345
Hey, there he is.

09:15.806 --> 09:16.847
Like clockwork.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.724
You late with your rent again?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.893
You got anything or not?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.438
I've got a hot kid
that could use some sparring.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.027
I don't fucking need that.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.259
You okay?

10:37.596 --> 10:39.556
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.979
What'd you think of the mick?

10:46.897 --> 10:48.939
Yeah, he... He can punch,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.233
he's got some juice.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.110
Bit mouthy.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.741
Ain't you forgetting something?

11:03.497 --> 11:04.498
Oh.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.218
Hey.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.969
Tilda says only single shots

11:18.970 --> 11:20.888
and to cut you off
at three drinks.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.266
I don't see Tilda. Do you?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.293
You can't touch a lady
like that!

11:51.294 --> 11:52.378
Crazy bitch!

11:52.379 --> 11:54.255
Who you fucking calling
a crazy bitch?

11:54.256 --> 11:56.632
You can't talk to
a motherfucking lady like that!

11:56.633 --> 11:58.926
What did I tell you...
I don't give a fuck...

11:58.927 --> 12:02.346
- You'll put me in a bad mood.
- Fuck you. I will kill you!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.807
- I will fuck you up, bitch!
- You're gonna fuck me?

12:04.808 --> 12:05.850
Yeah, bitch-ass.

12:05.851 --> 12:06.892
Are you out of your mind?

12:06.893 --> 12:07.977
No.
Fuck, you bit me!

12:07.978 --> 12:09.061
Hey!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.146
You know what happens

12:10.147 --> 12:11.397
- when I get in a bad mood.
-Or what?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.773
You want me to put
my fucking hands on you?

12:12.774 --> 12:13.858
Fuck you.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.152
Come on, pal.
Take it outside.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.320
What'd you say to me?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.114
I said take it outside.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.867
Get the fuck out of here.
Go back to your drink...

12:26.788 --> 12:28.331
Hey, you killed him!

12:29.332 --> 12:30.542
He ain't dead.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.586
He's just stupid.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.176
Hey!

12:40.177 --> 12:41.260
Hey, asshole!

12:41.261 --> 12:43.637
Look, lady,
I don't want no trouble.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.474
You knock out my boyfriend
and you don't want no trouble?

12:46.475 --> 12:47.559
He had it coming.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.479
Okay.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.981
Maybe he had it coming.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
Who's gonna walk me home?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.451
Easy, babe, easy!

13:05.452 --> 13:06.745
Easy...

13:08.288 --> 13:10.623
No need to be so rough.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.168
We'll get there soon enough.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.420
Promise.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.343
Ah. Easy!

13:23.803 --> 13:25.555
Easy.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.603
Easy.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.691
Easy.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.697
Easy.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.455
How do you get any sleep
living here?

13:51.456 --> 13:54.084
I like the noise.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.086
I mean, that drunk guy,
he screams, like, every night,

13:57.087 --> 13:59.548
so it's like music to me.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.800
I hate silence.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.426
I gathered that back at the bar.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.431
Like, this silence
reminds me of home.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.809
Hmm. Where's that?

14:11.434 --> 14:12.269
Hmm...

14:14.479 --> 14:15.647
Wellesley.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.649
Wellesley? Really?

14:18.233 --> 14:19.484
The good part.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.070
Big house on Cliff Road.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.198
And I was a good girl, too.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.284
Yeah?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.578
What the hell happened to you?

14:30.078 --> 14:30.912
Oof...

14:32.747 --> 14:34.790
God save the soul!

14:34.791 --> 14:38.002
Yo, Larry, shut
the fuck up! I've got company.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.713
Congratulations,
have a nice evening!

14:45.927 --> 14:48.305
See, you couldn't do that
in Wellesley.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.932
I guess not.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.518
Hmm...

15:00.358 --> 15:01.358
Get out.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.443
What?

15:02.444 --> 15:03.527
Lupe?

15:03.528 --> 15:04.778
Yeah?

15:04.779 --> 15:06.071
That's my name.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.616
You're kidding me.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.825
Well, I mean,
it's not my real name,

15:09.826 --> 15:10.909
it's my nickname.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.870
Actually,
it's not even my nickname.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.163
When I was at school,

15:14.164 --> 15:16.666
they used to called me loopy
'cause I was so fucking crazy.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.793
So it was kind of close, right?

15:19.544 --> 15:21.086
That's trippy, don't you think?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.006
Yeah, must be fate.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.760
So who is she?

15:28.219 --> 15:29.638
Oh, some whore.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.766
That's not nice.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.851
Listen,
she charged me ten bucks,

15:35.852 --> 15:38.229
so I don't know
what else you would call her.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.816
I thought I was in love.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.069
Got her name
tattooed on my hand,

15:45.070 --> 15:46.571
went back to show her...

15:47.656 --> 15:49.948
She was shagging
two of my friends.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.534
That was the end of that.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.748
That's fucking romantic,
is what that is.

17:26.671 --> 17:27.839
Yeah, boss?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.424
<i>I need for you
to go over to Dr. Gruber's,</i>

17:30.425 --> 17:31.760
<i>pick something up for me.</i>

17:33.136 --> 17:34.136
Uh-huh.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.764
<i>You remember
the address, right?</i>

17:36.598 --> 17:37.599
Of course, I do.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.956

Those are the bombers. 30 mills.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.877
They're all sealed.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.837
That's what you said last time.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.756
Hey, man, they were sealed.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.217
Any tampering happened,
that was on the other end.

18:13.218 --> 18:16.762
You sell this shit, you've got
to put your name on it, doc.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.391
- Any blanks in this batch...
- Okay, okay, I get it.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.645
I'll let 'em go for 15.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.148
Okay, man.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.650
Twelve.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.902
I don't have time
for this shit, doc.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.030
Fine. Ten.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.995
Let me ask you something.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.959
I've been having
some memory issues lately.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.044
Like what?

18:48.837 --> 18:52.506
Ah, forgetting names
and directions. Shit like that.

18:52.507 --> 18:53.758
How bad is it?

18:54.676 --> 18:57.387
I forgot where I lived
for a few minutes this morning.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.265
It's not the first time.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.852
It's not good.
It's not good at all.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.228
You should get that checked out.

19:54.611 --> 19:55.903
Good afternoon.

19:55.904 --> 19:56.988
Hey.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.533
Okay.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.582
Have you heard of CTE?

20:09.667 --> 20:12.670
Stands for Chronic
Traumatic Encephalopathy.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.633
Lots of football players
and boxers develop it.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.718
Too many blows to the head.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.803
Punch drunk.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.097
That's what
they used to call it.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.141
Have you sustained

20:26.142 --> 20:29.228
multiple concussions
over the course of your life?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.689
You could say that.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.609
Starting at what age?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.444
I don't know.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.989
First one was probably
around six or seven.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.241
Maybe younger.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.203
So, this took place at home?

20:46.204 --> 20:47.496
Just tell me what I got

20:47.497 --> 20:49.457
and what I need to take
to get better.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.837
There is no treatment.

20:55.922 --> 20:56.923
No drugs.

20:57.715 --> 21:00.551
And it's a fairly advanced case.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.350
Do you...

21:08.351 --> 21:10.019
have anyone?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.480
Wife?

21:13.064 --> 21:14.065
Kids?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.359
No, I don't know.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.154
I've got a couple of kids. Why?

21:21.114 --> 21:22.823
In the next couple of years,

21:22.824 --> 21:25.576
you can expect
a fairly sharp decline.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.581
Eventually, you won't be able
to care for yourself.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.835
Bullshit.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.713
I know it's hard...

21:37.714 --> 21:39.507
Listen, you don't know me.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.176
Just tell me how long I have.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.389
Until you're incapacitated?
I can't predict that.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.809
Just tell me,
how long do I have?

21:54.814 --> 21:55.940
I don't know.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.863
A couple of years at the most.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.616
Could be sooner.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.354
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hello, Daisy.</i>

23:59.730 --> 24:00.731
<i>Dad?</i>

24:02.567 --> 24:04.318
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

24:05.111 --> 24:06.111
No.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.697
<i>Did someone
die or something?</i>

24:09.407 --> 24:11.616
I just wanted to say hello.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.702
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

24:13.536 --> 24:14.537
No!

24:15.329 --> 24:16.914
<i>What the hell
do you want then?</i>

24:17.456 --> 24:19.624
Can I come by and see you?

24:19.625 --> 24:20.918
<i>Uh, fuck no.</i>

24:23.296 --> 24:24.296
Okay.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.464
I didn't mean to bother you.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.216
<i>No,
I don't want to see you.</i>

24:28.217 --> 24:29.759
<i>We have nothing to talk about.</i>

24:29.760 --> 24:31.928
<i>I've got an okay thing
going on right now.</i>

24:31.929 --> 24:34.014
<i>And I don't need you
or anyone else</i>

24:34.015 --> 24:35.349
<i>fucking it up for me.</i>

24:36.309 --> 24:37.143
Mmm-hmm...

24:37.977 --> 24:38.978
Okay.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.606
Have you heard from...

24:45.193 --> 24:46.444
My... my son?

24:47.028 --> 24:49.739
<i>Your son? You mean Colin?</i>

24:50.406 --> 24:52.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Colin.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.497
You have his number?

24:59.123 --> 25:00.750
I want to go see him.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.128
<i>Colin's dead.</i>

25:05.296 --> 25:06.297
What?

25:07.548 --> 25:08.673
When?

25:08.674 --> 25:10.343
<i>Almost two years ago.</i>

25:12.553 --> 25:13.638
But...

25:14.889 --> 25:15.890
What...

25:16.933 --> 25:18.851
Why didn't anybody tell me?

25:19.894 --> 25:21.561
<i>Why would they, Dad?</i>

25:21.562 --> 25:23.689
<i>You didn't even remember
his fucking name.</i>

25:25.233 --> 25:26.651
Where... where is he buried?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.327
Colin, Colin...

25:37.912 --> 25:38.913
Colin...

25:40.498 --> 25:41.916
Colin, Colin...

25:46.212 --> 25:47.255
Fucking idiot.

25:48.089 --> 25:49.090
Colin...

26:28.754 --> 26:31.674
You should take better
fucking care of this place!

27:25.728 --> 27:27.646
I thought I told you
not to come.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.023
Just wanted to see you.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.442
Okay. Well, you saw me.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.070
You can fuck off now, Dad.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.571
Excuse me.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.119
This is un-fucking believable.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.790
And to invite you
and your family to dinner.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.917
And why on earth
would I want to do that?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.714
Hi, sweetie.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.133
I'm your grandfather.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.553
Get your butt
back inside.

28:04.392 --> 28:07.019
Why are you...
Why are you selling the house?

28:07.561 --> 28:10.397
You really think
I can afford to buy a house?

28:10.398 --> 28:11.481
I rent it.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.565
The owner died

28:12.566 --> 28:14.819
and his kids are selling it
out from under us.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.363
Are you working?

28:18.322 --> 28:19.448
I'm dancing.

28:19.949 --> 28:20.949
Stripping?

28:20.950 --> 28:22.951
No,
I joined the fucking Bolshoi.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.327
Hey, hey, hey.

28:24.328 --> 28:25.830
- Hey, Mom!
- Hi.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.455
Um...

28:27.456 --> 28:29.667
This is your grandfather.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.962
Hey.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.673
So, you're the boxer?

28:36.465 --> 28:37.466
Was.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.679
You... you play for Dorchester?

28:42.263 --> 28:43.263
Newton.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.765
Newton?
They have a football team?

28:45.766 --> 28:48.059
He punched out
the Dorchester coach's son,

28:48.060 --> 28:49.686
and they kicked him
off the team.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.647
It's not funny.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.775
I don't even want him
playing football.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.901
You've got to go clean up.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.945
I could smell you
coming from a mile away.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.114
Smell this!
Goodbye.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.914
What, did you find Jesus
or something?

29:10.875 --> 29:12.585
I just want to explain...

29:14.545 --> 29:16.838
You...
you don't understand...

29:16.839 --> 29:18.339
No, that's just it.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.133
I do understand.

29:20.134 --> 29:22.385
You were a fucking asshole
to us.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.554
Just like my babies' daddies
are assholes.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.347
Just like your dad
was an asshole.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.057
And his dad, and on and on.

29:28.058 --> 29:32.187
Back to the asshole caveman
that spawned you all.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.939
It's a fucking family curse.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.860
The curse of the asshole father.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.158
The dinner,
just think about it, yeah?

29:46.911 --> 29:47.912
Okay.

29:48.496 --> 29:49.622
I thought about it.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.332
Fuck off.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.397
Dad?

30:57.398 --> 30:58.482
Yeah.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.695
I thought you were dead.

31:03.696 --> 31:04.780
Nah.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.491
It don't work that way.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.213
Are you still mad?

31:26.510 --> 31:27.511
Nah.

31:28.304 --> 31:30.222
I ain't mad no more, kid.

31:33.934 --> 31:34.977
We gonna fish?

31:38.647 --> 31:39.648
Nah.

31:47.531 --> 31:48.657
Where are we going?

31:49.950 --> 31:50.951
You'll see.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.580
I don't see any land.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.751
Enjoy the ride.
There'll be land soon enough.

32:00.044 --> 32:01.045
Promise?

32:01.962 --> 32:02.962
I promise.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.135
What is that sound?

32:10.137 --> 32:11.263
It's a guitar.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.724
It's in the engine.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.649
Yo!

33:47.443 --> 33:48.694
Yo, you lost?

33:50.696 --> 33:51.697
Come on.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.742
Yeah, you're the boy
our parents warned us about.

33:55.743 --> 33:58.620
Look at you now.
Mmm-hmm.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.330
So what do you do?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.374
What's you, a gangster?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.626
Huh? You a gangster?

34:05.627 --> 34:07.879
Were you born without a filter,

34:07.880 --> 34:10.131
or is that something
you have to work at?

34:10.132 --> 34:11.633
Ugh. Whatever.

34:12.593 --> 34:15.261
Nah, it's all just
a bunch of boo-boo.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.429
"Boo-boo"?

34:16.430 --> 34:17.639
Well, you know...

34:18.223 --> 34:20.476
You know,
boo-boo just means like...

34:21.018 --> 34:22.644
Some weak ass bullshit.

34:25.439 --> 34:26.774
Life ain't weak.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.070
Life's a shitstorm.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.742
But it sure as hell
ain't a bunch of boo-boo.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.827
Wow.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.705
So deep!

34:43.081 --> 34:45.291
I feel like I need to run.
Let's race!

34:45.292 --> 34:46.459
- Come on, let's race!
- No.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.879
Oh, oh, oh.
Okay, soccer knee, soccer knee.

34:50.339 --> 34:51.964
How about backwards race?

34:51.965 --> 34:53.758
-That's even worse.
- What?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.384
-It's worse.
- Come on! Come on!

34:55.385 --> 34:57.595
Stop it, there's people looking.
There's people looking.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.931
Oh, they gonna look, all right.
Come on!

34:59.932 --> 35:01.682
You gonna buy me a Guinness?

35:01.683 --> 35:04.685
I'll make 'em stop looking
if you buy me a Guinness.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.855
Come on, you gangster, boo-boo!

35:09.942 --> 35:12.318
Hey,
where's the screaming drunk?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.239
It's too early for him.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.574
He's a closing act.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.250
What are these bumps
in your tattoos?

35:26.792 --> 35:27.793
Scars.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.088
Cigarette burns.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.967
Life gives you lemons,
you make flowers.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.053
Who did this to you?

35:39.513 --> 35:40.639
Some asshole.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.685
I don't want to talk about it.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.923
I see you got your own scars.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.842
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

36:18.927 --> 36:20.178
How'd you get those?

36:20.888 --> 36:22.097
Some asshole.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.815
Where you going?

36:32.816 --> 36:34.484
Have to go to New York.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.697
You not gonna
kiss me goodbye?

36:39.698 --> 36:40.782
No.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.120
I don't have time for that.

36:45.871 --> 36:46.705
Hmm...

36:47.581 --> 36:49.124
Quite the sweet talker you are.

37:13.565 --> 37:14.566
Hey.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.278
Hey, you deaf?

37:19.613 --> 37:20.738
What?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.367
I asked, how much longer
to stay on I-90?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.079
Why aren't you
using your "gorithm"?

37:28.538 --> 37:30.081
Yeah, very funny, smart-ass.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.708
You said you've been to New York
like a million times.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.836
So, what's the best way
to get there?

37:39.466 --> 37:40.842
Did you forget?

37:41.718 --> 37:42.719
No.

37:43.345 --> 37:44.721
Go ahead. Use your toy.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.890
Yeah, I think you forgot
how to get there.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.559
Bullshit.

38:15.419 --> 38:17.254
They said
the northeast corner.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.297
Where should I park?

38:20.007 --> 38:21.091
Make a loop.

38:25.387 --> 38:26.638
What are you looking for?

38:27.681 --> 38:29.349
Anything that doesn't fit.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.186
Keep driving.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.649
Slower. Slower...

39:03.425 --> 39:04.426
Is that us?

39:15.896 --> 39:16.897
Yeah.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.193
- I'll see you back in Boston.
- Hey, no, no, no.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.112
I'm coming with you.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.697
No, it's not happening.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.200
Jeez,
what is wrong with you?

39:29.451 --> 39:31.410
Pop says he wants me
to learn the business

39:31.411 --> 39:33.246
from the bottom up. Remember?

39:34.081 --> 39:35.332
I got news for you.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.919
This business is all done
on the bottom.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.596
I want to know
what's back there.

39:50.597 --> 39:51.848
No, you don't.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.851
On jobs like this,
you got to learn not to look.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.105
Just do your business.
And look the other way.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.159
Cops.

40:13.495 --> 40:14.663
Fuck.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.208
Just be cool.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.670
Aw, shit!

40:27.467 --> 40:28.510
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

40:32.139 --> 40:33.765
Do me a favor
and get on the floor.

40:34.850 --> 40:35.891
What?

40:35.892 --> 40:37.435
- Get on the floor.
- Why?

40:38.353 --> 40:39.520
When this guy passes us,

40:39.521 --> 40:41.231
he's gonna
take a good, long look.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.441
And I don't need him
seeing you shit your pants.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.526
I'm... I'm cool.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.195
- I'm cool.
- You're not.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.363
Do me a favor, get down.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.865
Fuck!
Get on the fucking...

40:50.866 --> 40:53.034
No, I'm not getting
on the fucking floor.

40:54.703 --> 40:55.871
Hey, stop.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.622
Get down, now, get down!

40:58.623 --> 40:59.707
Let me up!

40:59.708 --> 41:01.835
Get down and stay there,
stay down.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.461
Stay there.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.990
This is fucking bullshit, man.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.327
I'm telling Pops
what you just did to me.

41:36.328 --> 41:37.913
You mean saving your ass?

41:39.456 --> 41:41.916
I'm getting sick
of the lack of respect

41:41.917 --> 41:43.667
that you've been showing me.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.669
They don't just hand
that shit out, son.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.088
You've got to earn it.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.480
And I know you're talking shit
to my old man about me.

42:05.482 --> 42:06.900
Trying to hold me back.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.903
That rocket fuel's
making you paranoid.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.934
If it ain't the dinosaur.

42:41.935 --> 42:44.520
Hey, fuckpig,
where do you want this?

42:44.521 --> 42:46.690
Take it around back,
Jurassic Park.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.109
What are you smirking at?

43:01.288 --> 43:03.248
What are you doing?
Don't get out.

43:04.374 --> 43:07.043
Those guys don't want us
seeing what's back there.

43:13.508 --> 43:14.926
You afraid of that guy?

43:16.261 --> 43:17.595
Just stay put.

43:27.147 --> 43:28.897
Get her! Let's go!

43:28.898 --> 43:29.982
Holy shit.

43:29.983 --> 43:31.317
I'm going to break your legs!

43:31.318 --> 43:32.610
Stop!

43:34.362 --> 43:36.363
Help. Please, help me.

43:36.364 --> 43:37.781
No! I want to go!

43:37.782 --> 43:39.158
Get down!

43:39.159 --> 43:41.035
Come down!

43:41.036 --> 43:42.120
No!

43:42.912 --> 43:43.912
No!

43:43.913 --> 43:45.332
Get the shit back off!

43:47.917 --> 43:49.293
I want to go!

43:49.294 --> 43:50.586
Shut the fuck up!

43:50.587 --> 43:51.879
Help!

43:51.880 --> 43:54.049
- Shut the fuck up!
- Help!

43:55.425 --> 43:56.593
Shut up!

44:00.096 --> 44:02.390
No! No!

44:09.773 --> 44:11.648
All right, here we go,
number four!

44:11.649 --> 44:14.026
Here we go. You got this!

44:14.027 --> 44:16.905
Come on, Dre!
Knock him on his ass!

44:21.576 --> 44:22.744
Come on, Dre.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.371
Get up off the ground.

44:25.372 --> 44:27.248
Come on, focus!

44:28.041 --> 44:30.250
Come on. You've got this.
All right. All right.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.295
- Here we go! Here we go!
-Hit it, hit it!

44:35.715 --> 44:37.634
Don't like him
playing football, huh?

44:42.055 --> 44:43.056
Do you mind?

44:43.765 --> 44:45.100
Free country.

44:45.892 --> 44:48.268
Jesus, he's playing terrible.

44:48.269 --> 44:49.687
Come on!

44:50.188 --> 44:51.523
Hit somebody!

44:56.403 --> 44:58.530
Please tell me
that's not a beer in there.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.746
Here we go! Here we go!
Yeah, Dre!

45:07.747 --> 45:09.749
That's my boy!

45:10.500 --> 45:12.585
Yes! Yes!

45:13.670 --> 45:15.462
Touchdown!
Touchdown!

45:19.217 --> 45:20.927
All right, let's do it again!

45:23.555 --> 45:26.098
Okay, excuse me, where's
my little Patriots player?

45:26.099 --> 45:27.683
Give me a hug. Oh, my God.

45:27.684 --> 45:30.185
You are so good.

45:30.186 --> 45:31.687
I am so proud of you.

45:31.688 --> 45:33.857
-Thank you, Mom.
- Yeah, all right.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.108
We've got to go pick up Katie.

45:36.109 --> 45:37.610
You looked good out there.

45:37.986 --> 45:39.654
Ah. I did okay.

45:41.156 --> 45:42.657
Here's something for you.

45:50.165 --> 45:51.707
That's my old reel.

45:51.708 --> 45:53.084
It's a Pflueger.

45:53.877 --> 45:56.670
It ain't for the heavy-duty
deep-sea stuff, but...

45:56.671 --> 45:58.506
it'll be good for what you need.

45:59.424 --> 46:02.259
- But... I don't fish.
- It doesn't matter.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.552
What do you say?

46:03.553 --> 46:04.929
Well, thank you.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.182
All right,
we've got to go get Katie.

46:08.183 --> 46:09.475
But you said I could stay

46:09.476 --> 46:11.478
and watch the next game
with my friends.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.354
I did? Fine.
Just be home by dinner.

46:14.355 --> 46:16.483
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- Okay. Bye, I love you.

46:19.027 --> 46:21.613
Didn't the court say
you couldn't hang out in parks?

46:22.989 --> 46:24.032
Take it easy.

46:29.370 --> 46:30.454
Yo, Dre!

46:30.455 --> 46:31.539
There you are.

46:33.750 --> 46:36.627
- I want to go with my friends.
- You're riding home with me.

46:36.628 --> 46:38.421
- Wait...
- I promised your mom.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.133
Come on.

46:56.397 --> 46:57.941
I have a question for you.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.446
Why did you punch
that coach's son out?

47:07.367 --> 47:08.826
He cheap-shotted me.

47:11.871 --> 47:14.249
Sometimes
you've just got to walk away.

47:24.717 --> 47:26.344
Mom says you were in prison.

47:28.096 --> 47:29.097
What for?

47:29.889 --> 47:31.182
Not walking away.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.978
I've done so much
stupid shit in my life,

47:35.979 --> 47:37.397
I can't even tell you.

47:43.403 --> 47:45.363
Are you still doing stupid shit?

47:52.870 --> 47:54.581
Mom said you probably were.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.709
What else did your mom tell you?

48:02.547 --> 48:04.007
That you...

48:06.426 --> 48:08.219
That you ran out on your family.

48:12.348 --> 48:13.433
Is it true?

48:25.695 --> 48:26.988
What was boxing like?

48:42.378 --> 48:45.255
What are you doing here?
It ain't the end of the month.

48:45.256 --> 48:46.633
This is my grandson.

48:47.467 --> 48:49.093
I want him
to take a look around.

48:49.844 --> 48:52.096
You want to be a boxer
like your grandfather?

48:53.765 --> 48:55.515
Mmm... I don't really know.

48:55.516 --> 48:56.600
Hey.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.560
This guy, back in the day,

48:58.561 --> 49:01.272
if he punched you, your fucking
ancestors would feel it.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.608
You think I'm joking?

49:04.192 --> 49:05.818
Make yourself at home, kid.

49:10.323 --> 49:12.825
Hey. Watch these two.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.413
Which one's better?

49:19.791 --> 49:21.334
They both look good to me.

49:22.251 --> 49:25.296
Watch their footwork.
Just their footwork.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.843
The guy on the right
has more power.

49:31.886 --> 49:33.054
But watch the girl.

49:33.930 --> 49:36.682
She's coming at him
from five different angles.

49:36.683 --> 49:39.018
Moving, sticking,
getting out of there.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.104
See what I mean?

49:42.647 --> 49:45.357
Calm, controlled, moving fast.

49:45.358 --> 49:47.984
Okay, now start punching.
Two lefts. Left!

49:47.985 --> 49:49.070
Right.

49:49.654 --> 49:50.780
Don't stay still.

49:52.031 --> 49:54.117
I'm gonna hit you
if you stay still.

49:55.868 --> 50:00.331
Left, right. That's it.

50:01.040 --> 50:04.001
Don't stay still.
Don't stay still, that's it.

50:05.712 --> 50:08.005
Back over this way. Keep moving.

50:09.048 --> 50:10.049
Good job.

50:12.301 --> 50:13.511
There you go.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.430
You're a natural, kid.

50:36.576 --> 50:37.577
Hey.

50:38.828 --> 50:41.247
Don't tell your mom
I took you to the gym.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.708
You afraid of her?

50:44.292 --> 50:46.084
Damn right, I am.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.170
Me, too.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.105
The water's really cold.

51:49.023 --> 51:50.274
On top, it is.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.652
But not down deep.

51:55.029 --> 51:56.531
Did you go to the bottom?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.199
Sure I did.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.495
Is that where guys
like us belong?

52:04.455 --> 52:05.456
Yeah.

52:11.212 --> 52:13.673
Help me, help me!

52:21.097 --> 52:22.640
Just don't think about it.

52:25.768 --> 52:26.769
Hey!

52:28.229 --> 52:29.564
Just don't think about it.

52:30.606 --> 52:31.858
Do like I taught you.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.277
Look the other way

52:35.069 --> 52:36.654
and enjoy the music.

53:53.481 --> 53:56.233
<i>He used to take me fishing
every Sunday.</i>

53:57.234 --> 53:59.195
<i>Every single Sunday.</i>

54:01.238 --> 54:02.448
<i>Just me and him.</i>

54:06.494 --> 54:08.870
<i>I wasn't allowed to set foot
in that boat</i>

54:08.871 --> 54:10.206
<i>if he wasn't with me.</i>

54:19.882 --> 54:22.343
<i>He gets arrested
this one Saturday night.</i>

54:23.636 --> 54:27.056
<i>And we can't raise the money
to bail him out until Monday.</i>

54:27.723 --> 54:30.058
<i>So, I figured
I would take the boat out,</i>

54:30.059 --> 54:33.145
<i>and he'd never
find out about it.</i>

54:38.859 --> 54:40.027
<i>He found out.</i>

54:51.789 --> 54:53.666
<i>He never took me fishing again.</i>

55:00.548 --> 55:03.217
<i>It was the one thing
we loved doing together.</i>

55:08.931 --> 55:10.975
<i>And he took it away
to punish me.</i>

55:19.442 --> 55:21.527
Waiting for the presents.

55:25.489 --> 55:27.324
Things are happening.

55:29.243 --> 55:30.411
Jurassic Park!

55:31.454 --> 55:33.163
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

55:33.164 --> 55:36.833
You got some girls here, right?
I thought maybe I'd take a look.

55:39.920 --> 55:43.591
You're a dirty old dinosaur,
homie! Mmm...

55:43.883 --> 55:45.593
We got Viagra too,
if you need it.

55:47.636 --> 55:48.804
Come on, OG.

55:50.306 --> 55:51.306
Hey.

55:51.307 --> 55:53.016
I've got to
give you props, <i>viejo.</i>

55:53.017 --> 55:55.019
You delivered us a good crop
right there.

55:55.936 --> 55:57.187
All right, now!

55:57.188 --> 55:58.439
Lovely ladies.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.482
Smile for me.

56:05.321 --> 56:07.573
Hey, come here. Smile.

56:08.282 --> 56:09.283
Smile.

56:13.204 --> 56:15.413
Trouble, ah. come.

56:15.414 --> 56:16.623
She's my favorite.

56:16.624 --> 56:19.668
Whole lotta trouble right here,
if you like that kind of stuff.

56:23.089 --> 56:24.090
Smile.

56:24.924 --> 56:26.550
Put on a smile, beautiful.

56:29.512 --> 56:32.223
Come now, off you go! Smile.

57:06.215 --> 57:08.259
No, no, no.

57:26.026 --> 57:27.069
I don't...

57:28.696 --> 57:30.239
I don't know why I'm here.

57:40.749 --> 57:44.336
Do... Do you have family
in the US?

57:45.421 --> 57:46.630
<i>Familia?</i>

57:50.801 --> 57:52.052
You want me to call?

57:58.434 --> 57:59.476
They already know.

58:02.771 --> 58:03.856
They know?

58:10.112 --> 58:11.447
Diego wants money...

58:12.907 --> 58:13.949
How much?

58:14.825 --> 58:15.826
Twenty-thousand.

58:16.285 --> 58:19.037
20,000, and they let you go?

58:19.038 --> 58:20.372
I will be free.

58:24.335 --> 58:25.336
Fuck.

58:40.643 --> 58:42.102
I can't help you.

58:44.438 --> 58:45.856
I can't help you.

58:47.983 --> 58:48.984
I'm sorry.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.009
Yeah?

59:15.010 --> 59:18.304
<i>Okay. The Priest
can meet you after mass.</i>

59:18.305 --> 59:19.597
Got it.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.309
<i>Get the whole nut,
right? No excuses.</i>

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:11.483
Hey, Father.
What's the rush?

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:16.530
Fucking idiot.

01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:53.609
I...

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.153
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.959
It's all there. 20,000.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.756
Don't want to know
where you got this.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:18.550
This'll buy you another month.

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:22.137
Hey, Father,
do you still take confession?

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:26.015
I don't have that kind of time.
I'll see you next month.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:30.979
Shit!

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.319
I shot a fucking priest.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.071
So, where's our guy?

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.283
He must
still be in there.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:03.363
Who the fuck are you?
Do I know you?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:07.826
Who hired you?

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:10.871
Fuck you.

01:03:11.497 --> 01:03:13.457
You're gonna kill me either way.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.211
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.172
You'll be dead in a few minutes.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.799
And I'm gonna find out
where you live.

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.428
I'm guessing,
I'm gonna find someone there.

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:29.848
Maybe your girl.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.821
He's a big motherfucker.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.825
Big spider tat on his neck.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.372
He said you'd be hard to kill.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.717
You don't think
these guys were there

01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:31.510
to take out the 20 grand,
do you?

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.513
That's not what the guy told me.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:37.516
You owe anybody any money?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.728
Nothing worth
that kind of attention.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:42.814
Revenge?

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:44.816
Now that's a long list.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.740
So, who the fuck are these guys?

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.867
Eh, just some fucking amateurs.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:59.289
You know, I'm starting to worry
about you a little bit.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:02.834
You worried now?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.881
Nice work.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:40.831
Hey!

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.040
Hey, what up, bud?

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.458
You shouldn't be here.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.794
Oh, yeah, why not?

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.379
Just go home.

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.756
So why don't you park
by your house?

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.175
I like my privacy.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:54.969
I come all the way
out here to see you,

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.554
and this is the greeting I get?

01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:58.222
How do you even know
where I live?

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.225
I went through
your wallet the other day.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:04.062
I know, that sounded
a little crazy out loud, right?

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:05.897
Come on!

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:08.567
Cute place.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.239
It's a shitty rental.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.330
There's...
there's nothing to do here.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.042
We can watch TV?

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.211
It doesn't work.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.715
How 'bout some music?

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.216
I don't have music.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.010
Everybody's got music.

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:37.095
I don't.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:53.945
Those aren't mine.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.204
Okay, they're mine.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.592
Did you notice
that I had memory problems?

01:08:17.803 --> 01:08:18.804
Yeah.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.556
But I just thought
you were an alcoholic.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:23.641
I am.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.146
I'm a real prize.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:39.908
It's sure quiet here.

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.458
You know my son
I told you about?

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.543
The one who died?

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:51.628
Yeah.

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.299
He overdosed on heroin.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.596
I'm sorry.

01:09:11.815 --> 01:09:12.899
He was gay.

01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:20.948
Did that bother you?

01:09:20.949 --> 01:09:22.033
I don't know.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.160
I guess so, yeah.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.748
Maybe if I'd been around more
when he was growing up,

01:09:29.583 --> 01:09:31.501
things would've been different.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.339
So what, you think
you're so fucking macho,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.259
it's just gonna rub off on him?

01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:41.887
Shit don't work like that.

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:58.152
We aren't gonna end well,
you and me.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:09:59.821
You know that, right?

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:14.293
Yeah, we're like
that scene in the movies

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:16.004
where the gasoline...

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:20.967
moves slowly...

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.263
towards the flame.

01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:31.686
Sooner or later...

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.246
But not tonight.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.023
Hey.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.863
It's me.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.657
Yeah, I know.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.161
What are you doing?

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:36.292
Listening to that guy
playing the guitar.

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:43.925
What guitar?

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:48.930
He... he was just playing.
Didn't you hear him?

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:51.599
No.

01:11:53.852 --> 01:11:55.186
You're hearing things.

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:23.213
I'm taking my daughter
and her kids

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.175
out to dinner on Friday night.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.011
I want you to come with me.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.348
You sure about that?

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:35.518
Yeah. I'm sure.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.249
You look nice.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.919
I need a drink.

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:04.506
"Why, thank you.
You look lovely too."

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.468
Hey! Can I get a drink?

01:13:09.469 --> 01:13:10.553
Sure.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.431
- Uh, double bourbon, rocks.
-What kind?

01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:15.391
The cheap kind.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.646
And for the lady?

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.357
Uh, just a glass of water, please.

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:28.863
Calm down, Sally,
they'll be here.

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.074
It's all good. Come on.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.208
They aren't coming.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.334
They aren't coming.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:46.005
Maybe... maybe I gave her
the wrong address.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.842
Shit, I must've given them
the wrong address.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:51.218
Sorry, but I simply

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:52.719
cannot hold this table
any longer.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.805
Fuck off!

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:55.264
Excuse me?

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:57.183
I said, fuck off!

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.685
Who says, "simply cannot"?

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.396
No one talks like that.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.605
Would you
speak to our manager?

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.900
No, no, no, no. That's...
That's not necessary.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.235
- Yeah.
- No!

01:14:08.236 --> 01:14:10.112
- Okay.
- No, no!

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.281
Hey, hey, okay.

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:14.992
What the fuck
are you looking at? Huh?

01:14:14.993 --> 01:14:16.661
High-end motherfuckers!

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:18.829
- Okay.
- We were supposed to...

01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:19.913
Hey, hey, hey!

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.624
-Let's just go...
- Where's the person

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.459
we were supposed to meet?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.627
Daisy.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:27.004
- Daisy?
- Yeah.

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:28.630
What about Colin?

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.383
Colin couldn't make it.

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.010
Daisy?

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.721
Yeah, your daughter.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:37.055
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.183
No, I don't think she's going
to be able...

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:40.768
I gave her the wrong address...

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.770
What... What...
My... my... my...

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.814
My daughter's not coming,
is she?

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.441
No, she's not coming.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.109
What... what's her name?

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:51.613
Your daughter's name is Daisy, baby.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.522
What the hell's
happening here?

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:10.608
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:14.653
You told her?

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:16.531
Yeah.
I called her last night.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:19.533
I mean, I thought, you know,
you were really upset.

01:16:19.534 --> 01:16:20.742
You fucking told her?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.036
-Hey!
- Yeah, she should know.

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.455
Get out of my house.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.916
Dad, stop.
She didn't mean anything.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:30.585
Get out, or I'll throw you out.
Crazy fucking bitch!

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:31.754
Cut it out!

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:34.966
So, you want to hit me?

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:36.634
You want to hit me?

01:16:37.302 --> 01:16:38.302
Okay.

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:39.678
Okay, fucking hit me.

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:42.055
Hit me, you fucking pussy.
I know you want to.

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.641
Dre, get back in the car.

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:48.146
Dre! Please!
Go, get in the car right now.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:50.398
Go!

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.180
I didn't want you to know.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:23.805
Okay.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.433
Well, she didn't deserve that.

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:29.479
Fuck.

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:40.781
Why... why didn't you come
to dinner last night?

01:17:40.782 --> 01:17:43.201
Says the guy who walked away
and never came back.

01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:45.328
You suck.

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:53.960
I've got to go pack,

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.338
'cause now we've got to be out
in two days.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.590
Where... where will you go?

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.009
I'll figure it out.

01:18:01.219 --> 01:18:03.053
Is there...
is there anything I can do?

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:07.517
I can take care of myself.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.482
Are you gonna get treatment?

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.150
I don't know.

01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:19.612
Well, you got a doctor?

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.323
I did.
That bitch can't help me.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:24.409
Christ.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:29.914
Hey.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.792
Do you need my help
to find a new doctor?

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:36.671
Why... Why would you do that?

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:44.679
Well, if you need my help,
let me know.

01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:57.066
Life's a shitstorm, isn't it?

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.529
What's her name?

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:46.616
What's her fucking name?

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.118
Fuck.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:54.707
Yeah.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.168
Maybe my son...

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.252
He's dead...

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:00.754
Yeah, he was a big dude...

01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:02.048
Dude, dude...

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:08.763
Ta-ta, tattoo, tattoo...

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.934
Big dude, tattoo...

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:14.809
on his neck.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.103
I can't remember it.

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:20.357
You fuckin' idiot!
Fuckin' idiot.

01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:22.317
<i>Fuck you! Big dude.</i>

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:24.194
Fuck you. Tattoo!

01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:26.863
Tattoo! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:27.989
Fuck you!

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.036
Fuck you, you, you!

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:40.835
Here comes the packing train!
Choo-choo!

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:43.381
Thank you. Keep it coming.

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:50.512
Choo-choo!
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga...

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:52.473
Train is leaving the station.

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:58.396
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
chugga-chugga...

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:03.150
What?

01:21:04.151 --> 01:21:06.654
Um... I need to talk to Dre.

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:11.617
All right.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:22.878
Hey.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:30.219
Can we talk?

01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:37.393
Dre, I...

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:43.691
It's hard.

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:47.111
Life, life... Life is hard.

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:52.658
I, uh...

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.581
I...

01:22:12.261 --> 01:22:14.263
What you saw yesterday...

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.307
my anger.

01:22:18.059 --> 01:22:19.268
What I'm saying is,

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.395
don't be like that.

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:23.814
Don't be like me.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:55.888
Fucking idiot.

01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:12.488
$40,000.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:17.743
It's... It's for a downpayment
on a house...

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.496
For my daughter, Daisy.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:27.753
Mr. Connor, I know
that's a lot of money, but...

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:34.051
I'm willing to pay
whatever interest you decide on.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.597
Mr. Connor...

01:23:42.143 --> 01:23:43.143
<i>So...</i>

01:23:43.144 --> 01:23:44.228
Mr. Connor...

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:48.607
I know 40,000 is a lot of money,
but...

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.444
I've been working for you
for 30 years.

01:23:52.445 --> 01:23:54.864
30 long years. And...

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:15.259
Mr. Connor?

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:18.554
Have a seat.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.560
- Who's...
-He works for me.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:31.524
So...

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:35.321
I saw doctor Gruber yesterday.
He came by for his Oxy money.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:38.574
Okay.

01:24:41.118 --> 01:24:42.702
He said something about

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:46.206
you maybe having some sort
of brain disease or something.

01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:47.625
He said I might.

01:24:52.338 --> 01:24:55.548
I mean, I can't even
put into words how sorry I am...

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.801
Get to the point.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:00.930
I have to let you go.

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:04.016
Let me go?

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.727
Boss! It's...

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:09.271
it's me! I'm fine.

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:11.190
Please.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:15.819
What about the other day?
The... the shooters?

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.154
I got all your money.

01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:19.907
What's your phone number?

01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:32.545
617...

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:42.888
What's your address?

01:25:53.107 --> 01:25:55.692
"Gee, SpongeBob,
I don't know..."

01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:57.653
Kyle!
No, fuck this guy!

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.535
Sorry.

01:26:05.536 --> 01:26:09.080
I can't have somebody in your
condition working for me.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.374
It's just too risky.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.092
So, that's it?

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:24.305
After 30 years?

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:26.807
I'm afraid so.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.481
This...

01:26:35.024 --> 01:26:36.691
this doesn't make sense, boss.

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:37.776
Come on, man.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:40.404
Let's not prolong this.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.324
The door's over there.

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.827
Or do you need directions?

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:13.811
First day on the job?

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:14.897
Yeah.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.243
You...

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.997
you hired those guys to kill me.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.333
Did you know about this?

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:36.418
Look.

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:40.463
You just walk away, all right?
There'll be no repercussions.

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:42.091
I like repercussions.

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:43.841
Open your safe.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.635
There's no winning here for you.

01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:48.263
Open your fucking safe!

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:50.224
You're fucking crazy.

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:51.599
Hey!

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.810
-No!
- Hey!

01:27:54.061 --> 01:27:56.854
Don't kill him! Don't kill him!
Don't kill him, all right?

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.439
I'm opening the safe.

01:28:05.239 --> 01:28:06.240
Back up.

01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:12.621
Fill the bag up... and the guns.

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:30.389
I came in here
to ask you for a favor.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.057
And you get rid of me

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:36.145
like I'm dogshit on the bottom
of your fucking shoe.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:39.523
Come on, man.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:41.942
Come on, man.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.154
Isn't the money enough?
Can't you...

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:47.031
can't you just walk away?

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:57.875
Yeah.

01:29:07.176 --> 01:29:08.761
Can you make me a promise?

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:12.806
The kid stays alive.

01:29:15.309 --> 01:29:16.310
Sit down.

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:24.193
All right.

01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:58.810
What's the fucking emergency
I had to rush down here

01:29:58.811 --> 01:30:00.394
in the middle of the night for?

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.147
Like you have anything
better to do.

01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:04.607
I was playing poker.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:07.236
I've seen you play cards.
I did you a favor.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.033
Jesus.
You going on a shooting spree?

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:15.119
Maybe.

01:30:18.372 --> 01:30:19.456
This is for you.

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:22.876
You've got my attention.

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:26.504
Can you get a cashier's cheque
for 70 grand?

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:27.589
Sure.

01:30:29.967 --> 01:30:32.761
I want you to put a downpayment
on this house.

01:30:33.846 --> 01:30:35.639
Take the check to my daughter,

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:39.309
and help her with the paperwork
and tax stuff.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:45.149
She's a bitch on wheels.
So, watch yourself.

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:56.368
Are you okay?

01:30:58.453 --> 01:30:59.454
Yeah.

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:01.123
I'm good.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:05.752
Should I ask you
where you got the dough?

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:14.595
It was nice knowing you.

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:26.190
Come on, come on, pick up.

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:38.118
Fuck.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:54.968
You home?

01:32:18.492 --> 01:32:19.533
Holy shit.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.161
Hey, buddy.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:26.540
What did you...

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:27.875
What...

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:30.462
Why the hell
would you do this to yourself?

01:32:31.255 --> 01:32:32.506
Boo boo...

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.175
Come on.

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:36.802
- Shit.
-Come on.

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:38.387
Shit.

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.265
Let's get you up. After three.

01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:43.767
Oh, shit.

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:48.729
Lay down with me.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:49.815
No.

01:32:55.654 --> 01:32:56.655
Ow.

01:33:01.159 --> 01:33:02.160
How do you feel?

01:33:04.705 --> 01:33:06.581
I'm sorry I screwed up.

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:16.173
When I said things weren't going
to end well,

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:19.051
I knew it would be me
that would fuck things up.

01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:20.178
Mmm.

01:34:20.906 --> 01:34:21.990
You need help.

01:34:25.369 --> 01:34:26.828
You're helping me.

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:30.832
I'm serious.

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.050
You are helping me.

01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:46.283
If it ain't my old friend,
Jurassic Park.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:48.994
I want to talk some business.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.796
What's your business?

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:02.299
I want to buy one of your girls.

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:07.137
You fall in love, <i>viejo?</i>

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:12.476
You going to pimp her out?

01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:17.397
You and me,
we're pieces of shit.

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:21.233
You're a funny guy.

01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:24.821
We live off pain and weakness.
We're bullies.

01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:28.408
And you think buying a <i>puta</i>
gonna change all that?

01:36:32.454 --> 01:36:33.455
Thirty thousand.

01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:43.215
Not bad.

01:36:48.053 --> 01:36:49.179
Which one do you want?

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:52.014
The little one
with the curly hair.

01:36:52.015 --> 01:36:53.600
And the blonde bangs.

01:36:58.230 --> 01:36:59.481
She ain't for sale.

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:01.316
Hey.

01:37:02.234 --> 01:37:04.985
I'm offering you
10,000 above asking price.

01:37:04.986 --> 01:37:06.529
She ain't for sale.

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:07.614
Why not?

01:37:15.956 --> 01:37:17.122
One of the <i>puteros</i>

01:37:17.123 --> 01:37:18.833
got a little carried away
with her tonight.

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:26.424
What was her name?

01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:29.511
Araceli.

01:37:30.971 --> 01:37:32.514
What are you gonna do with her?

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:35.016
I don't know, man.

01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:43.566
You can't change the world,
<i>viejo.</i>

01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:45.151
World don't want to be changed.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.744
I really don't want to
hurt anyone else, not even you.

01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:57.914
So, just do what I say, okay?

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:01.167
Come on.

01:38:10.719 --> 01:38:13.304
Come out! Come on, let's go!

01:38:13.305 --> 01:38:14.472
Girls! Come out...

01:38:16.266 --> 01:38:17.434
Wait downstairs.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:23.731
Come on.

01:38:23.732 --> 01:38:25.275
Tell your boy
at the front door to go home.

01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:28.736
- Do it!
- Armando, you can knock off now.

01:38:28.737 --> 01:38:29.820
You sure?

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.822
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it covered.

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:33.033
All right.

01:38:39.039 --> 01:38:40.415
Get the girls out of here.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:44.835
Girls, get out here!

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:47.212
Go wait in the bathroom.

01:38:47.213 --> 01:38:51.800
Come on, in the bathroom!

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:53.469
Johns stay inside.

01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:54.928
Out of the rooms!

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.431
Johns stay inside.

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:57.848
No rush.

01:38:57.849 --> 01:39:00.435
Hey, you! Inside! Inside!

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:10.820
Which way do you want me to go?

01:39:11.488 --> 01:39:12.656
The kitchen!

01:39:13.239 --> 01:39:14.239
Come on, girls.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.325
The kitchen!

01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:17.410
You, sit down.

01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:20.789
You, go!

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:26.169
<i>Dinero,</i> inside.
Bring... bring in here.

01:39:28.838 --> 01:39:29.838
Come on.

01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:30.965
Attagirl.

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:32.424
You're free.

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:33.718
Go! Go!

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:36.971
Pay them.

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:40.600
Easy, easy...

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:52.696
He has a gun!

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:58.034
No!

01:40:01.037 --> 01:40:03.665
Yeah, that's Sureño style
right there, bitch.

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:09.337
You're bleeding out good, <i>viejo.</i>

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.673
I can finish it off.

01:40:13.133 --> 01:40:14.843
You want me to make it quick?

01:40:16.428 --> 01:40:18.763
After you, fuckpig.

01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:32.193
Just go. Go.

01:40:55.884 --> 01:40:57.677
Don't wake up your mom.

01:40:58.887 --> 01:40:59.888
You hear me?

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:17.405
Don't come any closer.

01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:20.699
Are you okay?

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.910
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:24.204
Listen to me, Dre.

01:41:26.122 --> 01:41:30.043
You're gonna hear some bad stuff
about me in the next few days.

01:41:33.797 --> 01:41:37.300
Maybe the only way for me
to do something right...

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:39.844
is by doing something bad.

01:41:42.472 --> 01:41:44.474
I... I don't get it.

01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:49.771
It might not make any sense
to you now, but...

01:41:58.863 --> 01:41:59.864
I tried.

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:03.076
I tried.

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:05.453
Go back inside.

01:42:06.329 --> 01:42:08.539
I... I'll be fine. Go on.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.833
Go on. Go on.

01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:27.952
Hello?

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:53.311
Hello?

01:43:54.979 --> 01:43:56.356
Anybody here?
