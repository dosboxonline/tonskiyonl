all at once.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.875
What is "everything I want"?

03:59.541 --> 04:01.208
Since you know so much about me.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.250
To put a real stick
in the eye of the Empire

04:05.000 --> 04:06.333
and get paid for it.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.375
(SCOFFS) I wondered who you were.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.333
Who am I?

So we agree.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.375
(SCOFFS) No.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.041
I think it's all useless.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.833
Better to spit in their food
and steal their trinkets.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.208
It's better to live.

Better to eat, sleep, do what you want.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.375
You don't know me.

04:35.791 --> 04:39.083
(SCOFFS) I fought in Mimban when I was 16.

Straight out of prison, into the mud.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.125
I'm one of 50 that survived.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.291

04:49.166 --> 04:51.125
(SCOFFS) Ourselves.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.458
So, please...

04:56.166 --> 04:59.375
You were on the ground
in Mimban for six months.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.750
You came in as a cook.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.500
You lived because you ran.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.208
But you're right about one thing.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.375
The Empire had you fighting each other,

05:12.041 --> 05:13.958
which should make you
hate them all the more,

05:14.041 --> 05:15.583
and you do.

05:15.666 --> 05:16.875
I said I know you.

05:18.625 --> 05:21.833
I know the outside.
I know what people tell me when I ask.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.041
The rest, I imagine.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.125
I imagine your hate.

05:26.708 --> 05:29.833
I imagine that no matter
what you tell me or tell yourself,

05:29.916 --> 05:32.625
you'll ultimately die
fighting these bastards.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.916
So what I'm asking is this.

05:36.791 --> 05:40.541
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real

05:40.625 --> 05:43.916
than carve off useless pieces
till there's nothing left?

05:46.583 --> 05:48.916

27:19.625 --> 27:21.875
-As opposed to when?
-You trust him with our lives?

27:21.958 --> 27:23.125
That's my call to make.

27:24.416 --> 27:25.833
NEMIK: He's committed.

27:25.916 --> 27:27.041
I'm feeling that.

27:27.875 --> 27:28.916
I want to.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.125
Feel what?

27:30.208 --> 27:31.541
His belief in the cause.

27:32.666 --> 27:35.041
When it comes down to it,
that's all I need to know.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
Vel.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.208
-Vel!
-I trust him.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.375
Okay?

27:44.958 --> 27:46.208
All right?

27:51.750 --> 27:55.416
(WHOOSHING)

28:02.541 --> 28:04.166
KLEYA: Senator Mon Mothma's here.

28:06.666 --> 28:07.666
New driver.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.000
LUTHEN: Anyone we know?

28:10.625 --> 28:11.750
Never seen him.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.125
Chandrilan?

28:15.041 --> 28:16.958
(SIGHS) One would think.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.541
(CHUCKLES)

28:20.625 --> 28:21.625

28:22.208 --> 28:24.500
-What a pleasure to see you.
-You as well, Luthen.

28:24.583 --> 28:27.125
Sorry to be so late.
It's always right when you're leaving,

28:27.208 --> 28:30.125
everyone remembers things
they're meant to bother you with.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.500
(LAUGHS) Free your mind, Senator.
This is a place where time stands still.

28:33.583 --> 28:35.750
It's hard being surrounded
with this much history

28:35.833 --> 28:39.083
and not be humbled by the insignificance
of our daily anxieties.

28:39.166 --> 28:41.666
How true. (SIGHS)
And how I need to hear that.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.416
-You know Kleya.
-Of course.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.958
We often refer to the gallery

28:45.041 --> 28:47.250
as Coruscant's unofficial
temple of patience. (LAUGHS)

28:47.333 --> 28:49.541
Well, I have to start
coming here more often.

28:49.625 --> 28:50.958
-(LAUGHTER)
-You're teasing us.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.333
So, a gift for your husband.

28:53.416 --> 28:56.583
Yes. It's his Day of Days.
It's a Chandrilan custom.

28:56.666 --> 28:57.666
One of our many.

28:57.750 --> 28:58.958
Yours is a rich history.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.000
Well, that's a kind way of putting it.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.708
I put aside a few things.

29:02.791 --> 29:06.375
If I recall,
he has an interest in military artifacts.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.458
Yes.

29:07.541 --> 29:09.166
LUTHEN: So,
let's start with the oldest one.

29:09.250 --> 29:11.541
It's a Utapaun monk cudgel.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.041
You see the ceremonial variety
in many places,

29:14.125 --> 29:15.375
but this is the real thing.

29:15.458 --> 29:17.250
It's a unique gift for most, but...

29:18.625 --> 29:20.958
it's a treasure for the true aficionado.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.375
Dated to the eighth archaic settlem...

29:23.458 --> 29:24.708
May I show you something?

29:25.666 --> 29:28.333
Oh, don't bother.
I couldn't afford anything here.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.750
Please. There's no harm in looking.

29:30.833 --> 29:33.166
We just got in
some terribly interesting coins.

29:34.583 --> 29:35.958
-Yeah.
-(CHUCKLES)

29:37.291 --> 29:41.333
I'm trying to expand Perrin's tastes
beyond fighting implements.

29:41.416 --> 29:43.375
Is there anything else
that might interest him?

29:43.458 --> 29:44.625
Well, your timing is excellent.

29:44.708 --> 29:47.250
I have something very special
that just came in.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.333
Come with me.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.458
It's a two-faced divinity.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.458
Fourteen thousand years old.

29:55.541 --> 29:58.583
A sun goddess and a serpent
from the overworld

29:58.666 --> 30:01.125

(WHISPERING) If you can't deliver,
I need to know.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.833
-Do you think I'm not trying?
-I never think that.

30:05.916 --> 30:08.416
But I need to start planning
if you're no longer coming through.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.541
The money's there.

30:09.625 --> 30:11.916
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.625
I can't pull funds the way I used to.

30:14.708 --> 30:16.958
-They're watching me now.
-Oh, they're watching everyone.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.958
This is different. They're everywhere.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.500
There's a new spy every day at the Senate.

30:21.583 --> 30:24.791
I visit the bank, they're all new faces.

30:24.875 --> 30:26.166
You got a new driver.

30:26.250 --> 30:27.666

30:27.750 --> 30:29.125
I feel under siege.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.291
I have many mouths to feed.

30:33.375 --> 30:35.041
I can only forage for so long.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.625
I found someone I think can help me.

30:40.416 --> 30:41.708
Someone who?

30:41.791 --> 30:43.916
To bring into the circle? No.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.625
-I know what I'm asking.
-LUTHEN: No.

30:45.708 --> 30:46.791
We're vulnerable enough.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.625
We need funding, not more people.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.875
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

30:50.958 --> 30:52.500
No one's more at risk than I am.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.708
You think I haven't thought this through?

30:54.791 --> 30:56.708
I'd be the first one to fall.

Why don't you take this on loan?

31:08.166 --> 31:09.291
May I?

31:09.375 --> 31:12.291
If your husband doesn't love it,
I'll be glad to take it back.

31:13.791 --> 31:15.250
It's a daring choice,

31:16.291 --> 31:18.666
but I trust you'll have the courage
to turn back

31:18.750 --> 31:20.333
if it should be a bit much.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.416
I appreciate that.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.333
You'll be here?

31:24.416 --> 31:26.666
Well, if not, Kleya can always reach me.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.125
Kleya, can we have this wrapped
for the Senator?

Clem, this is Lieutenant Gorn.

-Wounded on top of it.

for as long as anyone can remember,

37:59.250 --> 38:01.916
the Aldhanis gather in this valley
for a celestial event

38:02.000 --> 38:04.125
they call <i>Mak-ani bray Dhani.</i>

38:04.875 --> 38:07.250
The Eye of Aldhani. Thousands of them.

38:08.208 --> 38:11.375
They'd hike for weeks to get here
just to see it from the sacred land.

38:11.458 --> 38:15.125
-To see what?
-Imagine 50 meteor showers all at once,

38:15.208 --> 38:18.166
but like a curtain
being pulled across the sky

38:18.250 --> 38:22.833
until the Eye, the window to the galaxy,
forms over the horizon.

38:22.916 --> 38:24.166
You've seen this?

38:24.250 --> 38:27.208
I've been here almost seven years.
I've seen it twice.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.500
It's not the event it used to be.

38:30.583 --> 38:33.500
Now they've got everyone relocated,
it's a pretty sad affair,

38:34.291 --> 38:35.541
but the Eye,

38:36.666 --> 38:38.583
it's not something you'll soon forget.

38:38.666 --> 38:40.125
Once every three years.

38:40.208 --> 38:43.375
To a thousandth of a second.
And it's not really a meteor shower.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.666
It's a recurrent band of crystalized,
noctilucent microdensities.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.750
Billions of crystals.
Very heavy but small and unstable.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.458
As the planet passes through the belt,

38:51.541 --> 38:53.833
they swarm the atmosphere,
heat up, and explode.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.291
From the ground, it's a thing of beauty.

38:57.375 --> 38:58.541
In the sky, it's chaos.

38:59.541 --> 39:01.291
We've calculated an escape trajectory

39:01.375 --> 39:03.666
that gets us out
just before the Eye closes.

39:05.083 --> 39:06.916
This happens in three days' time.

39:10.541 --> 39:11.916
(CHUCKLES)

39:12.000 --> 39:13.250
That's your cover.

39:13.958 --> 39:14.958
Yes.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.541
Gets us in, gets us out.

39:16.625 --> 39:19.333
They won't know where we came from,
and if we can beat the clock,

39:19.416 --> 39:21.708
we'll be gone
before they even know what happened.

39:21.791 --> 39:24.458
Now, you've got a lot to learn
and very little time to do it,

39:24.541 --> 39:28.625
so what we need to know is,
are you in all the way?

39:33.125 --> 39:34.208
Let's get to it.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.083
-(DOOR WHOOSHES)
-Speak.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.833
She's demanding the raw data
from the incident on Ferrix.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.833
The Starpath unit
that was recovered at the scene

39:43.916 --> 39:46.791
has been traced to a theft
at an air base under my jurisdiction, sir.

39:46.875 --> 39:50.041
She's overreaching
to increase the size of her portfolio.

39:50.125 --> 39:52.583
She should spend more time
on the security at her bases

39:52.666 --> 39:55.416
-and less furthering her career.
-Lieutenant Meero.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.541
The stolen item has great value,
sir, particularly to the rebels.

39:58.625 --> 40:01.166
Tracing its theft
might expose activity in my sector.

40:01.250 --> 40:03.250
People also take things for money,
do they not?

40:03.333 --> 40:05.875
Is it worth creating
this much intra-office friction

40:05.958 --> 40:09.125
in the pursuit of what seems like
a case of a robbery gone awry?

40:09.208 --> 40:12.291
Sir, it is my feeling
that this is part of an ongoing effort

40:12.375 --> 40:16.041
to steal proprietary Imperial equipment
in anticipation of an organized rebellion.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.291
I have three
previous case files on my desk

40:18.375 --> 40:19.791
that begin to suggest a pattern.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.125
Your feeling.

40:21.208 --> 40:25.125
I'm seeing signs of coordinated activity
over a number of sectors.

40:25.208 --> 40:26.500
What activity?

40:26.583 --> 40:28.750
Similar items of interest,
repeated methods.

40:29.541 --> 40:31.750
-Gut instinct.
-You came to us from enforcement.

40:31.833 --> 40:32.833
Yes, sir.

40:32.916 --> 40:36.541
Here, we act on vetted
and verified information.

40:37.666 --> 40:41.083
Alert me when this materializes
into something more definite.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.875
Until then,
confine future activities to your sectors.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.125
Thank you, Lieutenant.

40:50.291 --> 40:55.083
You have two sectors to supervise.
Blevin is handling six.

40:55.791 --> 40:56.958
He does, I will admit,

40:57.041 --> 41:00.333
hew to the traditional viewpoint
of this office and its staffing.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.166
He is, I'm sure, a challenge to work with.

41:03.250 --> 41:06.416
His quarterly reports, however, are in
and yours are not,

41:06.500 --> 41:09.458
and here we are spending
your valuable time with this issue.

41:11.083 --> 41:13.708
There's a high bar
for your performance, Lieutenant.

41:14.666 --> 41:16.083
Unfair perhaps,

41:16.791 --> 41:18.250
but senseless to ignore

41:18.333 --> 41:21.541
and potentially the foundation
of a uniquely superior career.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.583
You're supposed to be
more competent and tucked away.

41:25.666 --> 41:26.833
That's why you're here.

41:28.250 --> 41:31.291
That's why we're bringing in
officers like you.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.625
Let's remind everyone of that
and not get lost in the dust.

41:35.708 --> 41:37.000
Yes, sir.

41:37.083 --> 41:40.833
On a positive note, I was impressed
with your detention numbers from Sev Tok.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.208
Far above the quota.

41:43.291 --> 41:45.250
I may be sending more
of that sort of work your way.

41:45.333 --> 41:46.791
-Thank you, sir.
-We're done.

41:50.625 --> 41:54.958
(SIGHING)

41:55.583 --> 41:59.166
(FIRE CRACKLING)

42:14.666 --> 42:16.416
(SIGHS) Know how to use this?

42:17.041 --> 42:19.125
(BEEPING)

42:19.208 --> 42:20.208
Yeah.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.958
TARAMYN: That's the Rono freighter specs
and the console layout.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.041
You get done with that,

42:25.125 --> 42:27.083
that's a detailed map of the garrison.

42:29.458 --> 42:31.000
That's an Aldhani phrase book.

42:36.333 --> 42:37.541
(SNIFFLES)

42:42.375 --> 42:43.458
Can I eat my food?

42:45.291 --> 42:48.375
You'll eat,
you'll let Cinta check the bandage,

42:48.875 --> 42:51.125
and you'll have learned all that
by morning.

42:52.083 --> 42:53.416
I'll take the first watch.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.625
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
