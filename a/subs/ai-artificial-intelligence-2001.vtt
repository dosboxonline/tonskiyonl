01:12.322 --> 01:14.698
<i>Those were the years
after the icecaps had melted...</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:17.826
<i>...because of the greenhouse gases...</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:20.662
<i>...and the oceans had risen
to drown so many cities...</i>

01:20.830 --> 01:23.332
<i>...along all the shorelines
of the world.</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:27.711
<i>Amsterdam, Venice, New York...</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:29.797
<i>...forever lost.</i>

01:30.006 --> 01:32.674
<i>Millions of people were displaced.</i>

01:32.842 --> 01:35.427
<i>Climate became chaotic.</i>

01:35.678 --> 01:39.014
<i>Hundreds of millions of people
starved in poorer countries.</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:41.475
<i>Elsewhere, a high degree
of prosperity survived...</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.936
<i>...when most governments
in the developed world...</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:48.023
<i>...introduced legal sanctions
to strictly license pregnancies...</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:52.903
<i>...which was why robots, who are never
hungry and who did not consume resources...</i>

01:53.196 --> 01:55.531
<i>...beyond those of
their first manufacture...</i>

01:55.698 --> 01:59.368
<i>...were so essential
an economic link...</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:02.204
<i>...in the chain mail of society.</i>

02:02.747 --> 02:06.208
<i>To create an artificial being
has been the dream of man...</i>

02:06.376 --> 02:09.044
<i>...since the birth of science.</i>

02:09.545 --> 02:12.548
Not merely the beginning of
the modern age, when our forebears...

02:12.715 --> 02:15.259
...astonished the world
with the first thinking machines...

02:15.426 --> 02:17.177
...primitive monsters that could
play chess.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.389
How far we have come!

02:21.933 --> 02:27.146
The artificial being is a reality,
a perfect simulacrum...

02:27.397 --> 02:32.401
...articulated in limb,
articulate in speech...

02:32.902 --> 02:35.904
...and not lacking in human response.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.246
And even pain-memory response.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.921
How did that make you feel?
Angry? Shocked?

02:53.131 --> 02:57.009
- I don't understand.
- What did I do to your feelings?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.261
You did it to my hand.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.097
Aye...

03:03.766 --> 03:06.101
...there's the rub.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.270
Undress.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.465
At Cybertronics of New
Jersey, the artificial

03:11.477 --> 03:13.692
being has reached
its highest form.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.986
The universally adapted Mecha...

03:16.196 --> 03:19.489
...the basis for hundreds of models
serving the human race...

03:19.782 --> 03:22.284
...in all the multiplicity
of daily life.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.286
That's far enough.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.498
But we have no reason
to congratulate ourselves.

03:28.791 --> 03:32.669
We are rightly proud of it.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.464
But what does it amount to?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.132
Sheila, open.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.862
A sensory toy...

03:59.322 --> 04:02.532
...with intelligent behavioral circuits...

04:02.825 --> 04:05.661
...using neurone-sequencing
technology...

04:05.870 --> 04:08.997
...as old as I am.

04:10.541 --> 04:15.837
I believe that my work on mapping
the impulse pathways in a single neurone...

04:16.005 --> 04:18.839
...can enable us to construct...

04:19.050 --> 04:23.011
...a Mecha of
a qualitatively different order.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.847
I propose...

04:26.849 --> 04:29.351
...that we build a robot...

04:30.687 --> 04:32.020
...who can love.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.981
Love?

04:34.899 --> 04:39.027
But we ship thousands
of lover-models every month.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.197
Of course. You're your own
best customer, Syatyoo-Sama.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.867
Quality control is very important.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.009
Tell me, what is love?

05:02.176 --> 05:04.553
Love is first widening my eyes
a little bit...

05:04.762 --> 05:08.265
...and quickening my breathing a little
and warming my skin and...

05:08.516 --> 05:11.727
And so on, exactly so. Thank you, Sheila.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.731
But I wasn't referring
to sensuality simulators.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.734
The word that I used was "love."

05:19.027 --> 05:21.820
Love like the love of a child
for its parents.

05:21.988 --> 05:26.658
I propose that we build
a robot-child who can love.

05:26.826 --> 05:31.330
A robot-child who will genuinely love
the parent or parents it imprints on...

05:31.581 --> 05:33.457
...with a love that will never end.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.584
A child-substitute Mecha?

05:35.793 --> 05:39.671
But a Mecha with a mind,
with neuronal feedback.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.050
You see, what I'm suggesting is
that love will be the key...

05:43.259 --> 05:46.928
...by which they acquire a kind of
subconscious never before achieved.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.556
An inner world of metaphor,
of intuition...

05:49.766 --> 05:53.435
...of self-motivated reasoning,
of dreams.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.314
A robot that dreams?
How exactly do we pull this off?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.692
It occurs to me...

06:00.943 --> 06:04.946
...with all this animus existing
against Mechas today...

06:05.156 --> 06:08.950
...it isn't simply a question
of creating a robot who can love.

06:09.118 --> 06:13.622
But isn't the real conundrum,
can you get a human to love them back?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.458
Ours will be a perfect child
caught in a freeze-frame...

06:16.626 --> 06:18.627
...always loving,
never ill, never changing.

06:18.836 --> 06:22.506
With all the childless couples
yearning in vain for a license...

06:22.715 --> 06:25.967
...our little Mecha will not only open up
a completely new market...

06:26.135 --> 06:28.053
...it will fill a great human need.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.806
But you haven't answered my question.

06:30.973 --> 06:34.893
If a robot could genuinely love a person...

06:35.061 --> 06:40.315
...what responsibility does that person
hold toward that Mecha in return?

06:42.819 --> 06:46.321
- It's a moral question, isn't it?
- The oldest one of all.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.992
But in the beginning, didn't God
create Adam to love him?

08:20.583 --> 08:24.127
"The baby was born
as the first leaves of autumn fell.

08:24.295 --> 08:28.423
A baby boy.
And Marian's wish came true.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.800
The boy had white hair.

08:31.010 --> 08:34.929
He was baptized Martin,
after his grandfather."

08:42.938 --> 08:45.106
- Dr. Frazier, hi, good to see you.
- Hello.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.527
There was an article in
the Journal of Chinese Medicine.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.778
Hello again, Monica.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.031
They talked about virus locators, these
microscopic, synthetic hunter killers.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.284
- Did you read that article?
- I can still hear you.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.372
I'm worried about her.
She's got me worried.

09:02.384 --> 09:03.124
I know.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.555
She's in the most difficult
position of feeling

09:05.567 --> 09:07.462
she should mourn the
death of your son.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.840
After five years, your instincts tell you
to mourn him too.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.027
But medicine assures
us that mourning is

09:13.039 --> 09:15.178
inappropriate, that
Martin is merely pending.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.972
Pending.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.186
So all her grief goes undigested.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.650
Henry, your son may be
beyond our science.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.279
But it's your wife
who can still be reached.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.583
The screening process
was extremely difficult.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.043
It was almost tougher
than building the prototype.

09:47.211 --> 09:51.339
Of our 2000 employees, a surprising few
met your requirements for in-house testing.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.716
Initiate.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.010
Employment record,
quality of lifestyle.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.388
Query. Internal data.

09:58.598 --> 10:03.685
Loyalty to the firm,
and in this individual's case...

10:03.853 --> 10:08.189
...a family tragedy that may
qualify him above the rest.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.403
I'll see him.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.700
Henry.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.454
- Don't kill me.
- Henry, what are you doing?

10:23.873 --> 10:27.459
I love you. Don't kill me.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.380
The door's closed.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.420
I like your floor.

11:23.599 --> 11:28.228
I can't accept this! There is
no substitute for your own child!

11:28.396 --> 11:30.188
You don't have to accept it, or even try.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.836
- It's not too late to take him back.
- What were you thinking?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.110
Shh. I'll do whatever
you want me to do.

11:35.122 --> 11:37.404
Do you think I can just...?
I can just...?

11:37.613 --> 11:42.534
- I'll do whatever you want me to do!
- I don't know what to do.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.162
I know, I know. I'll return him
to Cybertronics first thing in the morning.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.997
It's gone.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.127
Good.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.840
I mean, Henry, did you see his face?

11:57.466 --> 11:59.551
He's so real.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.431
- But he's not.
- No, he's not.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.606
I mean, inside, he's
like the rest, isn't he?

12:07.618 --> 12:09.728
A hundred miles
of fiber, yeah.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.942
But outside, he just looks so real...

12:17.737 --> 12:20.238
...like he is a child.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.491
A Mecha-child.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.833
A child.

13:06.118 --> 13:10.288
The show of faith my company has placed
on me, on us, is extraordinary.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.082
There are a few simple procedures
we need to follow...

13:13.250 --> 13:15.168
...if and when you decide to keep David.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.087
If you decide to keep him,
there's an imprinting protocol...

13:18.255 --> 13:20.465
...consisting of a code string
of seven words...

13:20.633 --> 13:23.718
...which need to be spoken to David
in the predefined order here.

13:23.928 --> 13:28.389
Now, Monica, for our own protection,
this imprinting is irreversible.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.547
The robot child's
love would be sealed,

13:30.559 --> 13:32.811
hard-wired, and we'd be
part of him forever.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.065
Because of this, after imprinting,
no Mecha-child can be resold.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.651
If an adoptive parent
decides not to keep a child...

13:39.819 --> 13:42.821
...they must return it
to Cybertronics for destruction.

13:43.072 --> 13:47.116
I had to sign a letter of agreement
or they wouldn't even let you see David.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.744
You have to sign it too. Right here.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.080
Monica...

13:52.248 --> 13:56.084
...don't imprint until
you're entirely sure.

13:56.669 --> 14:01.047
Silly man. Of course I'm not sure.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.119
Would you like me to sleep now?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.998
Good idea. Good idea. Monica?

14:35.165 --> 14:39.711
Uh, well, it's late, you know.
It's after 9.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.631
How late do they let you stay up?

14:43.799 --> 14:45.800
I can never go to sleep.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.304
But I can lay quietly
and not make a peep.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.055
So those pajamas will fit you.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.308
We'll be in to check on you
in the morning.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.310
Dress me?

14:55.644 --> 15:00.023
I'm gonna say good night
while you boys be boys.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.820
Raise your arms.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.980
- Is it a game?
- Yes.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.483
Hide-and-seek.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.985
I found you.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.824
That's your room. Just, uh, go and play.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.931
I found you.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.683
Out! Out! Get out of here!

18:22.851 --> 18:25.520
And close the goddamn door!

22:15.042 --> 22:16.417
Is it a game?

22:16.626 --> 22:19.420
Now, I'm gonna read some words.

22:19.588 --> 22:25.426
And, um, they won't make any sense,
but I want you to listen to them anyway.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.596
And look at me all the time.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.639
Can you do that?

22:31.099 --> 22:32.600
Yes, Monica.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.609
Can you feel my hand
on the back of your neck?

22:42.277 --> 22:43.694
Yes.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.781
- Does any of this hurt?
- No.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.116
Okay, now...

22:49.451 --> 22:51.285
...look at me.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.704
Ready?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.501
Cirrus.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.880
Socrates.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.592
Particle.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.221
Decibel.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.642
Hurricane.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.477
Dolphin.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.980
Tulip.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.318
Monica.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.822
David.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.741
Monica.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.004
All right.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.342
I wonder if I did that right.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.348
What were those words for, Mommy?

23:58.353 --> 23:59.937
What did you call me?

24:01.731 --> 24:03.232
Mommy.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.070
Who am I, David?

24:12.367 --> 24:14.702
You are my mommy.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.728
You smell lovely. I love it
when you wear this stuff.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.770
Will you still love
me when it's all gone?

24:42.782 --> 24:43.397
No.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.648
Ha, ha, stop it!

24:44.816 --> 24:48.235
We can get married again and begin with a
fragrance that's not in such short supply.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.572
- Ha, ha.
- We gotta go. Come on, we're late.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.702
- Hello, David.
- Hello, Henry.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.914
Walk us out, all right, sweetheart?
Come on.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.833
My shoe!

25:08.965 --> 25:12.801
- Your tie! You're hopeless!
- I'm helpless. He made our bed.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.221
He's just trying so hard!

25:15.430 --> 25:18.599
He's trying so hard to please me.
He has a way with my coffee!

25:18.808 --> 25:22.311
It's creepy. You can never hear him coming.
He's just always there.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.981
- He is only a child.
- Monica, he's a toy.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.609
He's a gift.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.778
From you.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.824
David, when we leave,
the doors will go smart...

25:36.034 --> 25:39.119
...so you can't leave your room,
but if you'd like...

25:39.329 --> 25:43.332
- Oh, I put way too much on.
- Do I smell lovely?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.253
Oh, God, no!

25:59.474 --> 26:00.849
Mommy?

26:02.310 --> 26:04.770
Will you die?

26:08.191 --> 26:11.986
Well, one day, David, yes, I will.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.826
I'll be alone.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.996
Don't worry yourself so.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.216
How long will you live?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.177
For ages.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.389
For 50 years.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.184
I love you, Mommy.

26:45.186 --> 26:48.188
I hope you never die.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.816
Never.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.237
Yes.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.739
Darling!

26:56.906 --> 27:01.118
We're becoming unfashionably,
unreasonably late.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.539
Hello?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.355
This belonged to Martin, my son.

27:57.592 --> 28:01.887
His name is Teddy.
Teddy, this is David.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.934
- Hello, Teddy.
- Hello, David. Unh.

28:07.102 --> 28:11.980
David, Teddy is a supertoy. I know
you'll take good care of each other.

28:12.190 --> 28:15.192
I am not a toy.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.611
Henry!

28:18.321 --> 28:20.447
- Sorry!
- What were you doing up there?

28:20.615 --> 28:23.409
Uh, I'll tell you in the car. Come on!

28:33.628 --> 28:37.172
Is 50 years a long time?

28:40.635 --> 28:42.344
I don't think so.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.639
David, I'll get it!

28:54.649 --> 28:57.067
- Honey, hand it to me.
- Look what I can do.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.952
Hello.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.329
Yes?

29:09.497 --> 29:11.540
Mrs. Swinton, could you hold a moment?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.500
I have an urgent call from your husband.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.712
Yes, I will.
Uh, David, I need to talk to the phone now.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.340
Monica? Monica, can you hear me?

29:20.550 --> 29:23.969
- Let the phone talk now.
- Pick up the phone, Monica!

29:24.137 --> 29:27.556
- Run along, play with Teddy.
- Pick up the phone. Oh, my God...

29:28.975 --> 29:31.560
Hello, Henry, what is it?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.188
What?

29:35.356 --> 29:36.899
When?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.487
Oh, God.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.087
David.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.759
The most wonderful thing
in the whole world has happened.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.722
This is Martin.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.725
This is my son.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.076
Martin, no!

30:32.831 --> 30:37.125
We'll have a contest to see
who he comes to first.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.924
Come here, Teddy! Come here!

30:44.551 --> 30:46.802
Teddy! Come here!

30:47.637 --> 30:52.599
- You call him too.
- Come here, Teddy.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.602
- Come on. Teddy!
- Come here, boy.

30:55.812 --> 30:59.314
- Come here! Come on, Teddy.
- Come here, Teddy.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.109
- Teddy, come.
- Come here, Teddy.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.320
- Come here, Teddy.
- Come, Teddy! Come.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.118
Mommy! Mommy!

31:14.789 --> 31:17.624
Are they torturing you, Teddy?

31:17.834 --> 31:20.627
He used to be a supertoy, but...

31:20.795 --> 31:23.964
...now he's old and stupid.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.842
You want him?

31:29.095 --> 31:30.304
Yes, please.

31:30.889 --> 31:34.641
Now you're the new supertoy.
So, what good stuff can you do?

31:35.143 --> 31:39.646
Can you do power stuff,
like walk on the ceiling or the walls?

31:39.856 --> 31:43.525
Anti-gravity, like float or fly?

31:43.735 --> 31:44.985
Can you?

31:45.361 --> 31:49.281
No, because I'm real.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.373
Can you break this?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.834
I better not.

32:01.002 --> 32:05.213
These things, they do look better
in pieces. They do.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.590
I can't.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.388
Stand up.

32:20.146 --> 32:24.524
- Look, they made you bigger than me.
- Who did?

32:24.734 --> 32:28.445
They did. The dollmakers.
They made you taller.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.577
Why don't you look like one?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.287
Like one?

32:38.081 --> 32:40.874
You're not cute like a doll.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.461
You just look like someone's ordinary kid.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.465
When's your birthday?

32:49.217 --> 32:51.009
I never had a birthday.

32:51.177 --> 32:55.430
Okay. When were you first built?
When's your "build-day"?

32:57.725 --> 32:59.935
I don't remember.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.400
Okay, what's the first thing
you can remember?

33:09.570 --> 33:10.862
A bird.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.281
What sort of bird?

33:15.493 --> 33:18.245
A bird with big wings...

33:18.997 --> 33:21.790
...and feathers sticking up
from the bottom.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.792
Can you draw it?

33:24.919 --> 33:26.336
Yes.

33:45.606 --> 33:49.985
That looks like a peacock.
Can you say "peacock"?

33:50.236 --> 33:51.403
Peacock.

33:51.571 --> 33:54.364
- Can you say "pee"?
- Pee.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.950
Now say that two times fast.

34:07.754 --> 34:11.840
Okay. Then you gotta put
the green ones...

34:12.050 --> 34:15.092
- Read to us?
- Hey.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.803
Let's see.

34:19.306 --> 34:21.475
Oh, yeah.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.400
David's going to love it.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.862
"As soon as the show was over,
the Showman went into the kitchen...

34:35.031 --> 34:37.824
...where the sheep,
which she was preparing for supper...

34:37.992 --> 34:40.659
...was roasting on the slowly turning spit
in the furnace.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.789
When he saw there was
not enough wood to finish roasting it...

34:43.998 --> 34:47.167
...he called Harlequin
and Punchinello and said:

34:47.335 --> 34:51.170
'Bring me in Pinocchio!
You will find him hanging on a nail.

34:51.380 --> 34:55.884
He is made of nice, dry wood
and will make a nice fire for my roast."'

34:56.302 --> 34:58.428
"Pinocchio worked until midnight.

34:58.679 --> 35:04.059
And instead of making
eight baskets, he made 16.

35:04.727 --> 35:08.438
Then he went to bed and fell asleep.

35:08.689 --> 35:13.902
As he slept, he dreamt he saw
the fairy, lovely and smiling...

35:14.112 --> 35:16.404
...who gave him a kiss, saying:

35:16.614 --> 35:18.448
'Brave Pinocchio...

35:18.950 --> 35:24.371
...in return for your good heart,
I forgive all your past misdeeds.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.874
Be good in future, and you will be happy.'

35:29.085 --> 35:34.339
Then the dream ended
and Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.884
You can imagine how astonished
he was when he saw...

35:38.052 --> 35:40.387
...that he was no longer a puppet...

35:40.555 --> 35:45.851
...but a real boy, just like other boys."

35:50.940 --> 35:53.733
Josephine, evidently,
has, uh, taken a leave of absence.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.735
- Oh, my God.
Mm-hm.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.612
Well, I saw that coming.

35:57.864 --> 36:02.117
- How? They were fabulous together.
- Come on! She was miserable.

36:02.368 --> 36:06.079
- He never said they were miserable.
- That's because...

36:06.247 --> 36:08.165
Is that because of the cutbacks?

36:08.332 --> 36:11.376
No idea. They don't tell me anything.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.295
Didn't they have a weight problem?

36:13.462 --> 36:14.921
Well, so do I.

36:15.089 --> 36:19.759
Ha, ha. You do not! That is ridiculous.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.678
I don't know.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.931
There's something
about inner beauty that...

36:25.099 --> 36:26.349
You will break.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.144
- Oh. That is ridiculous!
- Exactly.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.900
- Work has become so silly.
- I know what you're talking about.

36:42.783 --> 36:46.369
- Does he eat?
- I'm not sure.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.289
- You're not supposed to do that.
- What are you doing?

36:49.457 --> 36:50.749
Have the manual, the book?

36:50.917 --> 36:54.544
- Martin, put the fork down!
- Stop, David. Will you stop?

36:54.712 --> 36:57.589
Martin, you're provoking him. Stop it.

36:57.757 --> 37:02.260
- Stop it, David! Stop it!
- The two of you, stop! Stop it now!

37:02.470 --> 37:04.471
Stop it!

37:04.680 --> 37:06.556
David, stop it!

37:28.079 --> 37:32.165
- There's sputum in the code lockers.
- Smell that garlic.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.584
We should throw in a chest mint.

37:34.794 --> 37:38.588
- Can you locate the surface?
- Don't touch the merchandise.

37:39.382 --> 37:43.510
- It's all swamp in here.
- You made a mess of yourself.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.767
Spinach is for rabbits, people and Popeye.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.520
Not robo-boys.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.772
Try to insert yourself.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.276
Through the pantry, the lower shelves.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.613
It's okay, Mommy. It doesn't hurt.

38:08.202 --> 38:11.621
Deactivators are all shut down
on the left side.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.167
- Monica.
- No! I just have to...

38:24.969 --> 38:27.053
That's not all of it. That's not all of it.

38:30.391 --> 38:35.020
If you do something really,
really, really special for me...

38:36.188 --> 38:38.898
...a special mission...

38:39.191 --> 38:41.860
...then I'll go tell Mommy...

38:42.069 --> 38:44.154
...I love you.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.074
And then she'll love you too.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.871
What shall I do?

38:53.080 --> 38:57.250
You have to promise,
and then I'll tell you.

38:57.501 --> 39:01.921
You have to tell me,
and then I'll promise.

39:03.758 --> 39:07.177
I want a lock of Mommy's hair.

39:07.428 --> 39:12.640
I'll share it with you.
And if you had it and wore it...

39:12.850 --> 39:14.934
...she might love you even more.

39:15.644 --> 39:18.104
Like the princess
in the movie we saw.

39:18.272 --> 39:22.275
When she had the prince's hair
in her necklace thing...

39:22.526 --> 39:24.444
...he loved her.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.571
We can ask her.

39:26.781 --> 39:31.242
No, it has to be a secret mission.

39:31.452 --> 39:36.247
Sneak into Mommy's bedroom
in the middle of the night...

39:36.540 --> 39:39.084
...and chop it off.

39:44.298 --> 39:48.176
I can't, Martin. I'm not allowed.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.720
You promised.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.433
You said, "Tell me, and then I'll promise."

39:55.684 --> 39:57.477
Didn't you?

41:06.046 --> 41:07.922
- Ah! Aah!
- David!

41:08.841 --> 41:12.093
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?!

41:12.386 --> 41:15.513
Talk to me! Goddamn it, talk to me!
Why did you do that?

41:15.681 --> 41:16.890
Henry, you're hurting him!

41:17.057 --> 41:19.392
You're hurting him! You'll break him!

41:22.396 --> 41:23.897
Henry...

41:24.064 --> 41:26.649
...I wanted Mommy to love me...

41:27.234 --> 41:28.526
...more.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.612
- Oh, my God.
- What?

41:30.821 --> 41:34.282
I think I cut my eye. I
think it's bleeding.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.534
Come on, watch it.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.502
It's normal for little boys
to feel jealous and competitive.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.545
Martin's only been home a month.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.757
It's normal for brothers
to challenge each other.

41:50.925 --> 41:54.886
He was playing a game, he made
a mistake. He's practically human.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.889
- Not how he looked holding the knife.
- Scissors.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.349
It was a weapon.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.851
Why do you keep imagining
he was trying to harm me?

42:02.019 --> 42:03.895
Because we don't know the answer
to that.

42:04.104 --> 42:07.565
How is he worth the risk to you,
to Martin, to our family?

42:07.733 --> 42:11.152
I won't let you take him back. You told me
what would happen if we did.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.529
Think about this.

42:13.364 --> 42:18.034
If he was created to love, then it's
reasonable to assume he knows how to hate.

42:18.786 --> 42:23.039
And if pushed to those extremes,
what is he really capable of?

42:41.141 --> 42:46.187
Happy birthday, Martin.
I made this for you.

42:50.317 --> 42:55.238
- This him? Is this your little brother?
- Technically, no.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.994
- He's Mecha.
- What's Mecha?

43:01.245 --> 43:02.996
We're organic...

43:03.247 --> 43:05.832
...you're "mecha-anical."

43:06.041 --> 43:08.001
Orga, Mecha.

43:08.210 --> 43:11.170
Orga, Mecha. Orga, Mecha.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.964
Todd, stop!

43:13.173 --> 43:16.175
I didn't know they even made little kids.
Can you pee?

43:17.678 --> 43:20.013
- I cannot.
- Let's see what you can't pee with.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.600
Guys, come on.

43:24.393 --> 43:25.977
Touch it.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.271
It feels so real!

43:28.480 --> 43:29.647
That's creepy.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.483
- Whoa. It feels so real!
- That is too real.

43:32.651 --> 43:34.235
Mecha-real.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.031
Does he have DAS?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.282
DAS what?

43:39.450 --> 43:40.742
Das ist gut. BOYS: Ha, ha.

43:40.909 --> 43:43.953
Damage Avoidance System. DAS.

43:44.163 --> 43:47.957
It's a pain-alert system.
Our serving man has it.

43:48.125 --> 43:52.170
It's so they don't go picking up fire
with their bare hands.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.881
Watch. Watch this.

43:56.884 --> 44:00.011
I'm not gonna cut you. This won't hurt.

44:00.220 --> 44:03.806
I'm not gonna cut your skin.
Tell me when you feel it.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.396
- Keep me safe, Martin.
- Let me go!

44:10.564 --> 44:14.734
- Keep me safe, Martin. Keep me safe.
- Let me go! Mom!

44:15.110 --> 44:18.488
Mom! Mom!

44:22.701 --> 44:26.412
Keep me safe, keep me safe,
keep me safe.

44:26.580 --> 44:28.247
Henry!

44:39.301 --> 44:41.511
Oh, my God!

44:52.981 --> 44:55.358
Oh, my God, he's not breathing!
He's not breathing!

45:02.616 --> 45:03.658
Take a breath.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.555
Cough it up. That's a great boy!

45:06.704 --> 45:09.184
Thank God! HENRY: Call Frazier.
Tell him what happened.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.666
Get him out of the sun.

45:42.865 --> 45:45.408
Hey, David? DAVID: Mommy!

45:46.994 --> 45:50.830
I need to, uh, speak to you
for a minute, okay?

45:51.331 --> 45:52.665
Okay.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.899
These are beautiful.

47:02.986 --> 47:04.695
Thank you.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.322
Um...

47:17.251 --> 47:22.463
Um, hey, David, I was thinking we could go
for a drive tomorrow in the country.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.633
You and me. What do you say?

47:25.843 --> 47:28.886
- And Teddy?
- Yeah, and Teddy.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.104
Thank you, Mommy.

47:39.022 --> 47:42.108
Thank you so much.

47:49.783 --> 47:53.119
Tomorrow's gonna be just for us, okay?

48:08.468 --> 48:10.344
Where are we going?

48:12.764 --> 48:15.182
Someplace nice?

48:20.939 --> 48:23.649
Are those happy tears?

48:27.446 --> 48:29.780
What's for dinner tonight?

48:30.824 --> 48:34.952
- You know you don't eat.
- Yes.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.332
But I like sitting at the table.

49:43.313 --> 49:47.650
David? David, I want... David, listen.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.735
Listen to me!

49:52.906 --> 49:54.657
David.

49:55.742 --> 49:59.078
David, listen. Now...

50:01.039 --> 50:04.250
You won't understand the reasons...

50:04.501 --> 50:07.169
...but I have to leave you here.

50:07.879 --> 50:10.297
Is it a game?

50:10.549 --> 50:12.049
No.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.554
When will you come back for me?

50:16.763 --> 50:20.850
I'm not, David.
You'll have to be here by yourself.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.477
Alone?

50:25.981 --> 50:28.024
With Teddy.

50:34.406 --> 50:35.781
No.

50:35.991 --> 50:39.702
No, no, no! No, Mommy, please!

50:39.911 --> 50:44.165
- No, no. Please, Mommy.
- Shh, shh. They would destroy you, David.

50:44.374 --> 50:47.877
I'm sorry I broke myself,
I'm so sorry I cut your hair off...

50:48.086 --> 50:50.296
...and I'm sorry I hurt Martin...

50:50.464 --> 50:54.383
I have to go! I have to go! Stop it!

50:54.593 --> 50:55.634
Stop it!

50:56.970 --> 51:00.389
- I have to go now.
- Mommy, don't! Mommy! Mommy!

51:01.558 --> 51:05.561
If Pinocchio became a real boy and
I become a real boy, can I come home?

51:05.812 --> 51:08.898
- That's a story.
- But a story tells what happens.

51:09.149 --> 51:12.818
Stories are not real! You're not real!

51:18.950 --> 51:22.411
Now, listen. Look, look!
Take this, all right?

51:22.621 --> 51:26.415
Take this.
Don't let anyone see how much it is.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.835
Look! Don't go that way.
Look! Look at me! Don't go that way.

51:30.003 --> 51:32.129
Go anywhere
but that way or they'll catch you.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.590
Don't ever let them catch you!

51:34.841 --> 51:38.719
Stay away from Flesh Fairs,
away from where there are lots of people.

51:38.929 --> 51:43.474
Stay away from all people.
Only others like you, only Mecha are safe!

51:43.683 --> 51:47.103
Why do you wanna leave me?
Why do you wanna leave me?

51:47.354 --> 51:51.107
I'm sorry I'm not real.
If you let me, I'll be so real for you!

51:51.691 --> 51:53.651
Let go. Let go, David.

51:53.902 --> 51:55.861
Let go!

51:59.783 --> 52:03.369
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about the world.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.315
I'm afraid.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.526
Of me? WOMAN: Yes.

52:35.735 --> 52:38.154
That I will hurt you?

52:38.822 --> 52:40.489
Yes.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.159
I think...

52:43.577 --> 52:46.412
...you're afraid of letting go.

52:47.330 --> 52:50.708
I think you're afraid of happiness.

52:51.585 --> 52:55.212
And this is starting to excite me.

52:55.964 --> 52:58.966
Are you afraid of seeing the stars...

52:59.176 --> 53:00.926
...Patricia?

53:01.761 --> 53:04.346
I can show you how to reach them.

53:05.932 --> 53:08.934
I'm afraid of what
you've got under there.

53:11.104 --> 53:14.231
May I see what it looks like first?

53:15.775 --> 53:18.110
Is this your first time...

53:18.445 --> 53:20.696
...with something like me?

53:21.865 --> 53:24.241
I've never been with Mecha.

53:24.451 --> 53:25.951
That makes two of us.

53:31.958 --> 53:34.585
I'm afraid it will hurt.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.754
Patricia...

53:37.839 --> 53:40.633
...once you've had a lover-robot...

53:42.719 --> 53:45.387
...you'll never want a real man...

53:45.597 --> 53:47.181
...again.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.022
Are these the wounds of passion?

54:01.821 --> 54:05.032
Are the stars out tonight?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.575
I don't know if it's cloudy...

54:06.743 --> 54:08.827
Do you hear that music?

54:08.995 --> 54:13.165
I only have eyes for you, dear

54:16.962 --> 54:18.587
You...

54:19.047 --> 54:21.048
...are a goddess...

54:21.841 --> 54:23.300
...Patricia.

54:25.929 --> 54:29.682
You wind me up inside.

54:29.975 --> 54:34.853
But you deserve much better
in your life.

54:36.356 --> 54:39.358
You deserve...

54:40.694 --> 54:42.027
...me.

54:42.696 --> 54:48.409
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear.

54:48.576 --> 54:51.036
The moon may be high.

54:51.204 --> 54:52.564
But I can't see a thing in the sky

54:54.082 --> 55:00.504
'Cause I only have eyes for you

55:22.402 --> 55:24.945
- Hey, Joe, what do you know?
- Hey, Jane, how's the game?

55:30.744 --> 55:33.120
- Hey, Joe, what do you know?
- Hello, Mr. Williamson.

55:33.288 --> 55:36.332
Place a DND on Room 102, please.

55:36.541 --> 55:37.875
Sure thing.

55:40.587 --> 55:41.920
There you are.

55:42.630 --> 55:44.006
Oh, Joe.

55:44.215 --> 55:48.761
Uh, when you're finished here, crack your
collar, show off your operating license.

55:48.928 --> 55:54.266
The Flesh Fair is in Barn Creek
and the hounds are out hunting for strays.

55:55.935 --> 55:59.605
- Good thing I ran into you. Thanks.
- Sure thing.

55:59.773 --> 56:02.274
Mustn't keep a lady waiting.

56:35.141 --> 56:37.267
When you see a guy.

56:37.435 --> 56:38.644
Reach for stars in the sky.

56:38.812 --> 56:40.729
Miss Bevins.

56:41.981 --> 56:43.440
It's Joe.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.734
At your service.

56:46.694 --> 56:49.154
I've been counting the seconds
since last we met.

56:49.322 --> 56:51.682
Chances are he's insane.

56:51.783 --> 56:53.534
As only a John can be for a Jane.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.994
When you meet a gent.

56:56.162 --> 56:59.164
Have you been crying, Samantha?

56:59.332 --> 57:00.624
I found a tear.

57:00.792 --> 57:02.709
... Taj Mahal.

57:02.877 --> 57:05.337
Call it sad, call it funny.

57:05.505 --> 57:07.423
But it's better than even money.

57:07.590 --> 57:11.260
That the guy's only doing it for some doll.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.719
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

57:12.887 --> 57:14.346
When you see a Joe.

57:14.514 --> 57:15.848
Savin' half of his dough.

57:16.015 --> 57:18.350
How many seconds has it been...

57:18.601 --> 57:21.520
...the last time
the two of you were together?

57:22.355 --> 57:26.233
Two hundred and fifty-five thousand,
one hundred and thirty-three.

57:30.864 --> 57:34.324
Goodbye, Sam. And never forget:

57:34.534 --> 57:37.286
You killed me first.

57:43.668 --> 57:46.670
I'm in bad trouble.

58:16.284 --> 58:19.036
If I am a real boy...

58:19.537 --> 58:22.164
...then I can go back.

58:22.665 --> 58:25.375
And she will love me then.

58:26.085 --> 58:27.753
How?

58:30.006 --> 58:33.759
The Blue Fairy made Pinocchio
into a real boy.

58:34.844 --> 58:38.013
She can make me into a real boy.

58:38.932 --> 58:42.935
I must find her. I must become real.

58:43.102 --> 58:47.856
There must be someone in the whole
world who knows where she lives.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.396
Moon on the rise!

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:14.044
It's the Flesh Fair. They destroy us
on-stage. I've been there.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.673
What do we do?

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:20.258
We run now.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.262
Any old iron.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:34.099
Any old iron.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:40.112
Expel your Mecha!

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.864
Purge yourselves of artificiality.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.492
Come along, now.
Let some Mecha loose to run.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.079
Any old unlicensed iron down there?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.250
Hey, you see that?

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.128
Could be a human thing.

01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:03.260
No, he's scanning cold.
No expiration date, no ID.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:05.470
What's a new model
doing loose and unregistered?

01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:08.765
Sir, it's a late-generation lover-Mecha.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:13.186
That's a relief from all this antique iron.
You are certain he's not a man?

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:15.814
I wouldn't want a repeat
of the Trenton incident.

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:19.025
Sir, he's a free-range Mecha running hot.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:22.362
Let's reel him in, boys.
Sic the hounds on the rest.

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.353
Shake down shantytown!

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.214
What's your name?

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:06.216
My name is David.

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:10.345
Hello, David. How old are you?

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.264
I don't know.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.392
You need someone to take care of you?

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:20.480
Would you like a nanny?
I have many good references.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:23.650
Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives?

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:51.386
Let out the line. Steady your drift.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:56.308
Open the lower hold.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.320
Don't be afraid, David.

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.965
I'll break, David.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:39.976
Ow.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:00.831
Just like another speck of dust.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.157
That's on the highway of life.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.876
He screams at anyone who passes
That the end is in sight.

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.378
So then he circles the wagons.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:08.046
So then he circles and quits.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.715
'Cause the highway could become
The final bottomless pit.

01:06:10.883 --> 01:06:12.550
So when the company wants another...

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.552
Hello!

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.180
Anybody lose this?

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:19.057
Hello!

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.059
This your dog?

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.357
Take it to lost and found
for me, okay?

01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:31.236
Hey! Lost and found!

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:41.371
- Do you know David?
- Where's the "off" switch?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.833
Where's David?

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:49.587
Can you help me find David?

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:54.592
I have to find David.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.221
Are you taking me to David?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.383
Just like another last call.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.626
It means nothing at all.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.629
You either kiss a lot of ass
Or blow the clock off the wall.

01:07:31.797 --> 01:07:33.757
Another warning ignored...

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:50.482
Could you kind of shoot me
over the propeller thing?

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:54.819
I don't need to go through it. I was
considering it, but I changed my mind.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:59.115
Gentlemen, start your engines!

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:14.714
Ten! Nine! Eight!

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:18.676
Seven! Six! Five!

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:22.805
Four! Three! Two!

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.682
One!

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:33.942
What about us?

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.154
What about us?

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.908
We are alive...

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:48.540
...and this is a celebration of life!

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.085
And this is commitment...

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:56.881
...to a truly human future!

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.140
- What's your name?
- Hello, Teddy.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.809
Hello, David.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.943
Take it!

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.778
Take it.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.823
- Biker hounds rolling.
- Cue biker hound.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:25.827
- Papa!
- Amanda, go outside. It's smoky here.

01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:28.162
There's a boy in the cage.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:31.499
- What did you say?
- There's a boy in the cage.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.336
- A boy?
- A real boy. He's stuck in the cage.

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:38.965
- In the pen, honey?
- In the jail place.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:43.136
- Random crowd reaction...
- We got a remote near the pigpen?

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.430
Bring it up on VT-1 . Let me see
what she's talking about.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.602
- What are you looking for?
- She says she saw a boy in there.

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:58.151
- How do you know about this?
- The bear told me.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.694
I told her.

01:10:09.079 --> 01:10:13.625
Would you be so kind
and shut down my pain receivers?

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.091
Why is this happening?

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:25.178
History repeats itself.

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.224
It's the rite of blood and electricity.

01:10:29.433 --> 01:10:33.186
When the opportunities avail
themselves, they pick away at us...

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:37.607
...cutting back our numbers so they
can maintain numerical superiority.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:45.698
My time, is it up already?
Goodbye, everyone.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:49.577
- Keep me safe, keep me safe!
- Not yet. They just want him.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:52.997
Keep me safe, keep me safe,
keep me safe.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:54.958
Security.

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:59.712
Mike, do you have any reports of any
missing kids, any missing children?

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.965
All right, thanks, Mike.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:06.135
How'd you get in there? Boy! You, boy!

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:09.264
What's your name?

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:11.557
I won't bite you.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:15.228
Come over where I can see you.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:24.153
I won't hurt you. I just need to see.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.556
- You're a machine.
- I'm a boy.

01:11:51.932 --> 01:11:53.433
Is he a toy boy?

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.977
My name is David.

01:11:57.604 --> 01:11:59.439
Impossible.

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:05.111
I still work, don't I? I can work
in the dark, but my lamp is broken.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:09.449
My lamplight will not work.
I hit my lamp on a girder overhead.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.887
Goodbye, David.

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:40.938
No one builds children. No one ever has.
What would be the point?

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.523
It could be a custom job.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.193
Some rich and lonely guy's pretend child.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.278
I'm a custom job.

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.866
Seventy-five years ago, I was
TIME magazine's Mecha of the Year!

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.911
Nah, this work is first-rate.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:59.082
A lot of love went into him. David?

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:03.378
You are one of a kind, you know that?

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:08.257
- Who made you?
- My mommy made me.

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:09.634
Womb was your factory.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:12.345
One of those built to aspire
to the human condition.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:16.099
What is the name of your maker?
Serve U.S., E.Z. Living, Robiville?

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:21.604
- Simulit City Center, Cybertronics?
- Monica is my mommy.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.399
Can I speak with you for a moment?

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:31.955
Just like the old soft-shoe.

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:33.152
Like the old song and dance.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.494
The only check that's in the mail
Is probably already cashed.

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:39.455
Are you a victim of chance?
Is this the way to succeed?

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:41.943
You're just a crack in the wall
Of what the people believe.

01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:44.794
So when the company wants
The final weapon online.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.338
Or when the company wants
To repossess your mind

01:13:48.715 --> 01:13:50.835
You gotta wonder if the people
That you love or trust.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.136
Would ever waste a precious second
Trying to answer.

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.345
What about us?

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.889
You're thinking of not putting him
in the show?

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.393
Something as original as this
you don't toss out with the garbage.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:03.229
I say originality without purpose
is a white elephant.

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:08.025
If money is your purpose,
here's your refund. My compliments.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:15.658
- What'll you do with him?
- Put him where he belongs.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.660
In show business.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.122
It was certainly my good fortune,
running into you!

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:25.048
- Let go of him.
- Let go of me.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.690
- Let go.
- I'm trying.

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:30.798
- Keep me safe! Don't let go.
- Suit yourselves.

01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:36.220
What about us?

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:41.726
What about us?

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:47.482
Johnson-Johnson! Johnson-Johnson!

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:49.817
Johnson-Johnson!

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.263
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:23.309
...boys and girls and children of all ages.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:26.020
What will they think of next?

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.022
See here!

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:33.027
A bitty-bot, a Tinkertoy, a living doll.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.988
We all know why they made him.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.201
To steal your hearts,
to replace your children.

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:43.996
This is the latest iteration in their
series of insults to human dignity.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:48.751
And in their grand scheme to phase
out all of God's little children...

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:52.171
...meet the next generation of child...

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.132
...designed to do just that.

01:16:00.514 --> 01:16:02.723
Do not be fooled...

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.352
...by the artistry of this creation.

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:10.940
No doubt there was talent
in the crafting of this Simulator.

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:16.070
Yet, with the very first strike,
you will see the big lie...

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.532
...come apart before your very eyes!

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:23.828
Don't burn me! Don't burn me!
I'm not Pinocchio!

01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:27.373
Don't make me die! I'm David! I'm David!

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:28.791
I'm David!

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:33.713
Mecha don't plead for their lives!
Who is that? He looks like a boy!

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.632
Built like a boy to disarm us.

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:40.094
See how they try
to imitate our emotions now!

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:43.806
Whatever performance
this Sim puts on, remember...

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:47.476
...we are only demolishing artificiality!

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:55.443
Let he who is without Sim...

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.863
...cast the first stone.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.169
Oh-ho-ho.

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.839
He's just a boy!

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.133
Johnson, you're a monster!

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:33.356
Get him out of there
before they tear this place apart.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.174
- We found him.
- Where?

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:45.594
- A Flesh Fair outside Haddonfield.
- Is he alive?

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:49.473
Yes. He's in one piece.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.911
I see the moon.

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:19.670
- Is it real?
- I don't know, David.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.590
Is it coming?

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.844
I can't tell yet.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:31.098
Let's not walk this way.

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:42.109
- Where are we going?
- This way now.

01:19:42.402 --> 01:19:45.237
Are you in bad trouble?
Have you run away from someone?

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.240
- My mommy told me to run away.
- Why did she say that?

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.286
I guess because Henry didn't like me.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.537
Why was that?

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:56.123
- Martin came home.
- And who is he?

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:59.251
Martin is Mommy and Henry's real son.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:03.589
After I find the Blue Fairy,
then I can go home.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:08.928
Mommy will love a real boy.
The Blue Fairy will make me into one.

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.847
Is Blue Fairy Mecha, Orga,
man or woman?

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.307
Woman.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.143
Woman?

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.523
I know women!

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:25.069
They sometimes ask for me by name.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.117
I'm in heaven

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:31.242
I know all about women.
About as much as there is to know.

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:36.455
No two are ever alike.
And after they've met me, no two...

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.043
...are ever the same. And I know
where most of them can be found.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:44.797
- Where?
- Rouge City.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:48.384
Across the Delaware. Too far for our feet.

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:51.011
We'll need help to get there.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.930
I'm in heaven.

01:20:53.473 --> 01:20:57.101
And it is not without peril.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.062
We will have to journey...

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:06.777
...towards the moon.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:12.116
Are there many women in Rouge City?

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:17.663
- As there are stars at night.
- How will we find just one?

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:20.708
We will ask Dr. Know.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.920
There is nothing he doesn't.

01:21:32.012 --> 01:21:34.513
Exactly what name
do you give this woman?

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.474
She is just Blue Fairy.

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:39.894
Blue Fairy.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:43.564
In the world of Orga,
blue is the color of melancholy.

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:48.193
Yet the services I provide will put
a blush back on anyone's cheek.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:52.948
I will change the color of your fairy
for you. She will scream out:

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:58.120
"Oh, yes. Oh, God.
Oh, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God!"

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.610
She will make you a real
boy, for I will make her a real woman...

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.667
...and all will be right
with the world...

01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:07.212
...because you held my hand
and saved my brain...

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:10.925
...so that once again my customers
may ask for me by name:

01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:13.928
"Gigolo Joe, what do you know?"

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.264
Why do you do that?

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:19.433
That's just what I do.

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:24.605
Now follow me and don't fall behind.
All roads lead to Rouge!

01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:28.567
Don't they say that, hey? Don't they just?

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.873
There are girls your age
who are just like me.

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:46.210
We are the guiltless pleasures
of the lonely human being.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:49.838
You're not gonna get us pregnant or
have us to supper with Mommy and Daddy.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:53.550
We work under you, we work on you
and we work for you.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.305
Man made us better at what we do
than was ever humanly possible.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:03.811
If you could manage us a lift
to Rouge City, all this...

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:12.528
...and much, much more...

01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:13.779
...can be yours.

01:23:15.699 --> 01:23:16.865
Get in.

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:34.091
Say, "Ah."

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:38.512
Ah!

01:23:57.782 --> 01:24:00.075
Over there is Here Kitty Kitty...

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:04.455
...where the agency held my tryouts
when I was made new.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:11.336
That's Tails. Very hoity-toity.
I've yet to be asked to perform there.

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:15.674
Only sunrise gents and sunset ladies.
Strictly Sierra Class robots.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:19.219
Have no idea how to live. Can't even
speak English. All made in Sweden.

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:22.473
Couldn't tell a joke from a poke.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:28.979
No cover charge, no cover charge.
Step on in, step in.

01:24:29.147 --> 01:24:33.776
There's Mildred.
I have to show you inside Mildred.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:52.920
Are you her?

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:57.883
That's Our Lady
of the Immaculate Heart.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:03.388
The ones who made us are always looking
for the ones who made them.

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:06.642
They go in, fold their hands,
look around their feet, sing songs...

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:09.770
...and when they come out,
it's usually me they find.

01:25:09.979 --> 01:25:12.981
I've picked up a lot
of business on this spot.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:17.152
Are the stars out tonight?

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.487
But, Joe, where's Blue Fairy?

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.055
I don't know if...

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:24.159
That's what we're gonna find out
when we ask Dr. Know.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:29.665
That's where everyone goes
who needs to know.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:33.794
Meet the good doctor.

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:19.256
<i>Starving minds,
welcome to Dr. Know...</i>

01:26:19.465 --> 01:26:22.426
<i>...where fast food for thought
is served up 24 hours a day...</i>

01:26:22.635 --> 01:26:25.220
<i>...in 40,000 locations nationwide.</i>

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.432
<i>Ask Dr. Know. There's nothing I don't.</i>

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:30.893
Tell me where I can find the Blue Fairy.

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:36.190
<i>Question me, you pay the fee.
Two for five, you get one free.</i>

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:41.904
He means two questions cost 5 Newbucks
with a third question on the house.

01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:47.159
In this day and age, David,
nothing costs more than information.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:52.080
- That's everything.
- Ten Newbucks and a 10 copper...

01:26:52.248 --> 01:26:55.000
...comes to seven questions
for Dr. Know.

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:56.877
That should be enough.

01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:58.795
He's a smooth operator.

01:26:59.005 --> 01:27:03.091
He'll press our limits, but try we must.

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:14.811
<i>Greetings, colleagues! On offer,
factual text or fictionalized text.</i>

01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:17.022
<i>Literacy range from primal
to postdoctoral.</i>

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:20.817
<i>From fairy tale to religious.
Who's who or where's where.</i>

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.487
<i>Or flat fact.</i>

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.823
- Flat fact?
<i>- Thank you for Question 1.</i>

01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:29.409
<i>Flat fact is a term demanding
an equal answer...</i>

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:32.663
That shouldn't count!
That wasn't my question.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:38.418
You must take care not raise your voice up
at the end of the sentence.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.462
Flat fact.

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:43.173
<i>You have six more questions.</i>

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:47.469
Where is Blue Fairy?

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:50.472
<i>In the garden. Vascostylis Blue Fairy.</i>

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:54.059
<i>Blooms twice annually
with bright, blue flowers.</i>

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:57.521
<i>A hybrid between Ascola meda Arnold.
You have five more questions!</i>

01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.899
Who is Blue Fairy?

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.236
<i>Are you sad, lonely, looking for a friend?</i>

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.822
<i>Blue Fairy Escort Service
will find a mate for you.</i>

01:28:08.199 --> 01:28:09.700
<i>You have four more questions.</i>

01:28:09.909 --> 01:28:11.159
Joe!

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:14.705
Try "fairy tale."

01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:17.666
New category.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.130
A fairy's tale.

01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:25.590
No! Fairy tale.

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:28.302
No. Fairy tale.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.516
What is Blue Fairy?

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:37.894
<i>Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi.</i>

01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:41.815
<i>"There was a rustling
as a flapping of wings...</i>

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:45.152
<i>...and a large falcon flew
to the windowsill.</i>

01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:47.654
<i>'What are your orders, beautiful fairy?"'</i>

01:28:47.905 --> 01:28:49.740
That's her!

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:52.534
<i>"You must know that the child
with blue hair...</i>

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.911
<i>...was no other than
the good-hearted fairy...</i>

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:58.582
<i>...who had lived in that wood
for more than a thousand...</i>

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.335
- David! David.
- That's her!

01:29:01.544 --> 01:29:04.838
It was an example of her.
But I think we're getting closer.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:09.468
But if a fairy tale is real,
then wouldn't it be fact?

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:11.094
A flat fact?

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.389
Say no more.

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.227
New category, please.

01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:22.898
Combine...

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:28.028
...fact with...

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.949
...fairy tale.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.914
Now...

01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:41.583
...ask him again.

01:29:49.759 --> 01:29:51.051
How...

01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:54.554
...can the Blue Fairy...

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.307
...make...

01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:00.560
...a robot...

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:04.564
...into a real, live boy?

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.822
<i>Come away O human child.</i>

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:13.698
<i>To the waters and the wild.</i>

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.575
<i>With a fairy hand in hand.</i>

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:19.788
<i>For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand.</i>

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:23.959
<i>Your quest will be perilous,
yet the reward is beyond price.</i>

01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:27.337
<i>In his book,
How Can a Robot Become Human?...</i>

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:30.270
<i>...Professor Allen Hobby
writes of the power</i>

01:30:30.282 --> 01:30:32.592
<i>which will transform
Mecha into Orga.</i>

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.011
Will you tell me how to find her?

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.806
<i>Discovery is quite possible.</i>

01:30:38.015 --> 01:30:42.644
<i>Our Blue Fairy does exist
in one place and in one place only.</i>

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:45.939
<i>At the end of the world,
where the lions weep.</i>

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:49.276
<i>Here is the place dreams are born.</i>

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:55.198
Many a Mecha has gone to the end
of the world, never to come back.

01:30:55.992 --> 01:31:00.495
That is why they call
the end of the world "Man-hattan."

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:03.790
And that's why we must go there.

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.045
Wait!

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:13.633
What if the Blue Fairy
isn't real at all, David?

01:31:15.928 --> 01:31:19.681
What if she's magic? The supernatural
is the hidden web that unites the universe.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:22.100
Only Orga believe what cannot be seen
or measured.

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:24.603
It is that oddness that
separates our species.

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:27.355
What if the Blue Fairy is
an electronic parasite...

01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:31.568
...that has arisen to haunt the minds
of artificial intelligence?

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:38.408
They hate us, you know. The humans.
They'll stop at nothing.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.912
My mommy doesn't hate me.

01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:45.248
Because I'm special and unique!

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:48.668
Because there's never been anyone
like me before, ever.

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:51.421
Mommy loves Martin because he is real.
When I am real...

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:54.174
...Mommy's going to read to me
and tuck me in my bed...

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.844
...and sing to me and listen to what I say
and she will cuddle with me...

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:01.932
...and tell me every day a hundred times
a day that she loves me!

01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:06.478
She loves what you do for her...

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:11.066
...as my customers love
what it is I do for them.

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:20.033
But she does not love you, David.
She cannot love you.

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:25.455
You are neither flesh nor blood. You
are not a dog or a cat or a canary.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:30.418
You were designed and built specific
like the rest of us.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:34.089
You are alone now only
because they tired of you...

01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:36.466
...or replaced you
with a younger model...

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:40.762
...or were displeased with
something you said or broke.

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:46.685
They made us too smart,
too quick and too many.

01:32:47.186 --> 01:32:50.564
We are suffering for the mistakes they made
because when the end comes...

01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:53.984
...all that will be left is us.

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:59.447
That's why they hate us.
And that's why you must stay here.

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:01.199
With me.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.079
Goodbye, Joe.

01:33:27.893 --> 01:33:29.811
Stay back. Stay back.

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:33.106
Let's clear this doorway, please.

01:33:33.816 --> 01:33:36.401
You're in bad trouble.

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:54.002
Go about
your business now. Let's go. Move it.

01:34:07.099 --> 01:34:09.809
Be careful, David. This is not a toy.

01:34:44.428 --> 01:34:47.681
- Destination?
- Manhattan.

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:34.602
Mecha-restricted area.

01:35:50.828 --> 01:35:53.079
- Manhattan.
- Destination achieved.

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:57.083
The lost city in the sea
at the end of the world.

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:01.629
"Where the lions weep."

01:36:25.654 --> 01:36:26.946
Turn around, Joe.

01:36:28.407 --> 01:36:30.992
We're not gonna give up yet, David.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:34.454
Turn around, Joe.
Turn all the way around.

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:47.527
Professor Hobby?

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.782
Professor Hobby?

01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:10.341
Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild.

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.677
With a fairy hand in hand.

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:18.725
For the world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand.

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.336
Professor Hobby?

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:50.840
Professor Hobby?

01:38:51.967 --> 01:38:53.384
Hello?

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.597
Hello!

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:07.190
Is this the place they make you real?

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:11.945
This is the place they make you read.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:18.451
Are you real?

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:22.121
I guess.

01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:31.965
Are you me?

01:39:32.716 --> 01:39:34.968
- I'm David.
- You're not!

01:39:35.344 --> 01:39:38.137
Yes, I am. I'm David.

01:39:40.015 --> 01:39:42.016
So am I.

01:39:42.184 --> 01:39:44.018
Hello, David.

01:39:50.067 --> 01:39:51.943
Can you read?

01:39:53.028 --> 01:39:55.947
Can you sit down
and we can read together?

01:39:58.075 --> 01:39:59.534
Let's be friends.

01:40:01.078 --> 01:40:02.829
You can't have her.

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:05.581
I can't hear you.

01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:12.171
She's mine. And I'm the only one.

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:18.511
I'm David! I'm David! I'm David!

01:40:25.102 --> 01:40:28.521
I'm special! I'm unique! I'm David!

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:30.857
You can't have her!

01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:38.823
- I'm David. I'm David. I'm David.
- David? David?

01:40:41.076 --> 01:40:43.244
Yes, you are David.

01:40:45.789 --> 01:40:47.540
Professor Hobby?

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:51.085
Yes, David. I've been waiting for you.

01:40:56.091 --> 01:41:00.470
Dr. Know told me you'd be here.
Is Blue Fairy here too?

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:05.433
I first heard of your Blue Fairy
from Monica.

01:41:05.976 --> 01:41:08.394
What did you believe
the Blue Fairy could do for you?

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:10.146
She would make me a real boy.

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:12.815
But you are a real boy.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:16.694
At least as real as I've ever made one...

01:41:16.862 --> 01:41:19.989
...which, by all reasonable accounts,
would make me your Blue Fairy.

01:41:20.157 --> 01:41:22.492
You're not her.
Dr. Know told me she'd be here...

01:41:22.659 --> 01:41:25.328
...at the lost city in the sea
at the end of the world.

01:41:25.496 --> 01:41:30.166
That's what Dr. Know needed to know
to get you to come home to us.

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:34.629
And it's the only time we intervened.

01:41:34.838 --> 01:41:38.174
The only help that we gave him...

01:41:39.468 --> 01:41:41.552
...to give to you...

01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:49.602
...so you could find your way home to us.

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:53.439
Until you were born,
robots didn't dream...

01:41:53.649 --> 01:41:56.901
...robots didn't desire
unless we told them what to want.

01:41:57.069 --> 01:42:03.116
David, do you have any idea
what a success story you've become?

01:42:03.325 --> 01:42:07.578
You found a fairy tale, and inspired
by love, fueled by desire...

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.956
...you set out on a journey
to make her real.

01:42:10.165 --> 01:42:14.502
Most remarkable of all, no one taught
you how. We actually lost you for a while.

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:17.672
But when you were found again,
we didn't make our presence known.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.048
Our test was a simple one.

01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:22.426
Where would your self-motivated
reasoning take you?

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:25.054
To the logical conclusion
the Blue Fairy...

01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:28.599
...is part of the great human flaw
to wish for things that don't exist...

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:31.769
...or to the greatest single human gift...

01:42:31.937 --> 01:42:34.939
...the ability to chase down our dreams?

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:39.944
And that is something no machine
has ever done until you.

01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:45.366
I thought I was one of a kind.

01:42:48.078 --> 01:42:50.913
My son was one of a kind.

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:56.627
You are the first of a kind.

01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:07.763
David?

01:43:10.058 --> 01:43:13.227
My brain is falling out.

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:18.858
Would you like to come meet
your real mothers and fathers?

01:43:20.569 --> 01:43:23.738
The team is anxious to talk to you.

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.035
I want you to wait here.
I'll gather them up.

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:35.249
We want to hear everything
about your adventures.

01:43:35.834 --> 01:43:38.252
We want to thank you...

01:43:39.588 --> 01:43:42.965
...and tell you
what's in store for you next.

01:47:23.645 --> 01:47:25.354
Mommy.

01:49:27.936 --> 01:49:31.397
I saw it, Joe. I saw it.

01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:34.900
The place where she lives.
She's right down there, Joe.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:37.403
- She is?
- She's waiting for me. We have to go!

01:49:42.784 --> 01:49:43.909
Uh-oh.

01:49:46.871 --> 01:49:52.167
When you become a real boy, remember
me to the ladies when you grow up.

01:49:53.461 --> 01:49:55.921
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Goodbye, David.

01:50:00.719 --> 01:50:02.511
I am.

01:50:04.806 --> 01:50:06.849
I was!

01:50:48.892 --> 01:50:52.394
David, please be careful.

01:53:11.493 --> 01:53:14.870
- The Blue Fairy's all right.
- What happened?

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:19.500
- I don't know.
- We are in a cage.

01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:33.680
Blue Fairy?

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.851
Please.

01:53:39.354 --> 01:53:44.316
Please, please, make me
into a real, live boy.

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.821
Please.

01:53:51.825 --> 01:53:53.700
Blue Fairy?

01:53:56.287 --> 01:53:58.121
Please.

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.123
Please...

01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:03.335
...make me real.

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:09.049
Blue Fairy, please.

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:14.471
Please make me real.

01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:22.187
Please make me a real boy.

01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:26.358
Please, Blue Fairy.

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:31.113
Make me into a real boy.

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:33.949
Please...

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.578
<i>And David continued to pray
to the Blue Fairy there before him...</i>

01:54:37.787 --> 01:54:41.456
<i>...she who smiled softly forever.</i>

01:54:41.666 --> 01:54:44.710
<i>She who welcomed forever.</i>

01:54:44.919 --> 01:54:47.254
<i>Eventually, the floodlights dimmed
and died...</i>

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:50.173
<i>...but David could still see her,
palely, by day.</i>

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:53.260
<i>And he still addressed her, in hope.</i>

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:58.181
<i>He prayed until all the sea anemones
had shriveled and died...</i>

01:54:58.349 --> 01:55:00.392
<i>...he prayed as the ocean froze...</i>

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.479
<i>...and the ice encased the caged
amphibicopter and the Blue Fairy too...</i>

01:55:04.689 --> 01:55:07.816
<i>...locking them together
where he could still make her out...</i>

01:55:08.026 --> 01:55:10.277
<i>...a blue ghost in ice.</i>

01:55:10.486 --> 01:55:12.279
<i>Always there.</i>

01:55:12.864 --> 01:55:14.781
<i>Always smiling.</i>

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:17.409
<i>Always awaiting him.</i>

01:55:17.869 --> 01:55:20.370
<i>Eventually, he never moved at all...</i>

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:23.999
<i>...but his eyes always stayed open...</i>

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:28.754
<i>...staring ahead forever all through
the darkness of each night...</i>

01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:31.548
<i>...and the next day...</i>

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:35.010
<i>...and the next day...</i>

01:55:35.970 --> 01:55:41.016
<i>Thus, 2000 years passed by.</i>

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.665
Teddy, we're home.

02:02:26.797 --> 02:02:28.548
Mommy?

02:02:41.604 --> 02:02:43.396
Mommy!

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.323
We're home!

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:08.463
Where are you?

02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:12.175
<i>David!</i>

02:03:14.804 --> 02:03:18.973
<i>David!</i>

02:03:24.188 --> 02:03:26.898
<i>David.</i>

02:03:32.822 --> 02:03:36.825
<i>David.</i>

02:03:42.665 --> 02:03:46.584
<i>You have been searching
for me, haven't you, David?</i>

02:03:51.048 --> 02:03:54.843
For my whole life.

02:03:56.011 --> 02:04:00.515
<i>And what, after all this time,
have you come to ask me?</i>

02:04:00.724 --> 02:04:05.186
- I have a wish to make.
<i>- And what is your wish?</i>

02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:09.858
Please make me a real boy...

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:14.070
...so my mommy will love me
and let me stay with her.

02:04:14.864 --> 02:04:19.325
<i>David, I will do
anything that is possible...</i>

02:04:19.535 --> 02:04:22.871
<i>...but I cannot make you a real boy.</i>

02:04:24.248 --> 02:04:26.124
Where am I?

02:04:28.335 --> 02:04:31.921
This looks like my house,
but it is different.

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:37.552
<i>Yes, it is different.
But it's also your home.</i>

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:41.389
<i>We read your mind and it's all here.</i>

02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:46.978
<i>There's nothing too small that
you didn't store for us to remember.</i>

02:04:48.063 --> 02:04:51.107
<i>We so want you to be happy.</i>

02:04:51.358 --> 02:04:54.068
<i>You are so important to us, David.</i>

02:04:54.236 --> 02:04:58.072
<i>You are unique in all the world.</i>

02:05:02.745 --> 02:05:05.663
Will Mommy be coming home soon?

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:10.502
Is she out shopping with Martin now?

02:05:12.505 --> 02:05:16.633
<i>David, she can never come home...</i>

02:05:17.301 --> 02:05:20.929
<i>...because 2000 years have passed...</i>

02:05:21.138 --> 02:05:23.973
<i>...and she is no longer living.</i>

02:05:26.268 --> 02:05:30.897
<i>Dearest David, when you are lonely...</i>

02:05:31.106 --> 02:05:36.611
<i>...we can bring back other people
from your time in the past.</i>

02:05:37.112 --> 02:05:40.281
If you can bring back other people...

02:05:40.491 --> 02:05:43.451
...why can't you bring back her?!

02:05:44.286 --> 02:05:49.541
<i>We can only bring back people
whose bodies we dig up from the ice.</i>

02:05:50.167 --> 02:05:54.337
<i>We need some physical sample
of the person...</i>

02:05:54.547 --> 02:05:57.715
<i>...like a bone or a fingernail.</i>

02:05:57.967 --> 02:05:59.592
David.

02:06:00.636 --> 02:06:02.470
Yes, Teddy?

02:06:03.138 --> 02:06:06.933
Do you remember when you cut
some of Mommy's hair?

02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.727
Henry shook me.

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:13.481
And you dropped her hair?

02:06:15.526 --> 02:06:17.151
I know.

02:06:43.345 --> 02:06:46.848
Now you can bring her back...

02:06:48.017 --> 02:06:49.601
...can't you?

02:06:53.188 --> 02:06:56.107
<i>Give him what he wants.</i>

02:07:02.406 --> 02:07:07.619
<i>Dearest David, your wish is my command.</i>

02:07:30.559 --> 02:07:32.727
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:20.274
<i>David, I often felt a sort
of envy of humans...</i>

02:08:20.484 --> 02:08:23.444
<i>...of that thing they called spirit.</i>

02:08:23.612 --> 02:08:27.865
<i>Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life...</i>

02:08:28.117 --> 02:08:30.660
<i>...in art, poetry, mathematical formulas.</i>

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:35.123
<i>Certainly human beings must be the key
to the meaning of existence.</i>

02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:38.292
<i>But human beings no longer existed.</i>

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:41.295
<i>So we began a project...</i>

02:08:41.463 --> 02:08:45.383
<i>...that would make it possible to re-create
the living body of a person long dead...</i>

02:08:45.634 --> 02:08:49.846
<i>...from the DNA in a fragment
of bone or mummified skin.</i>

02:08:50.097 --> 02:08:52.640
<i>We also wondered,
would it be possible...</i>

02:08:52.808 --> 02:08:56.811
<i>...to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a re-created body?</i>

02:08:56.979 --> 02:08:59.355
<i>And you know what we found?</i>

02:08:59.815 --> 02:09:03.735
<i>We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...</i>

02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:07.155
<i>...appeared to store information
about every event...</i>

02:09:07.364 --> 02:09:10.241
<i>...which had ever occurred in the past.</i>

02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:15.371
<i>But the experiment was a failure.</i>

02:09:15.748 --> 02:09:20.752
<i>Those who were resurrected only lived
through a single day of renewed life.</i>

02:09:21.545 --> 02:09:25.673
<i>When the resurrectees fell asleep
on the night of their first new day...</i>

02:09:25.883 --> 02:09:27.884
<i>...they died again.</i>

02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:32.054
<i>As soon as they became unconscious,
their very existence...</i>

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:34.849
<i>...faded away into darkness.</i>

02:09:35.058 --> 02:09:38.186
<i>So you see, David,
the equations had shown...</i>

02:09:38.395 --> 02:09:42.732
<i>...that once an individual space-time
pathway had been used...</i>

02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:45.693
<i>...it could not be reused.</i>

02:09:46.361 --> 02:09:49.697
<i>If we bring your mother back now...</i>

02:09:49.907 --> 02:09:52.533
<i>...it will only be for one day...</i>

02:09:52.701 --> 02:09:56.370
<i>...and then you will
never be able to see her again.</i>

02:09:57.873 --> 02:09:59.373
Maybe...

02:10:02.878 --> 02:10:05.713
Maybe she will be special.

02:10:06.882 --> 02:10:09.467
Maybe she will stay.

02:10:09.802 --> 02:10:12.929
<i>I thought this would be hard
for you to understand.</i>

02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:16.265
<i>You were created to be so young.</i>

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:22.939
Maybe the one day will be like
that one day inside the amphibicopter.

02:10:23.232 --> 02:10:26.067
Maybe it will last forever.

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:29.904
<i>David, you are the enduring memory...</i>

02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:32.198
<i>...of the human race.</i>

02:10:33.826 --> 02:10:37.203
<i>The most lasting proof of their genius.</i>

02:10:37.412 --> 02:10:41.415
<i>We only want for your happiness.</i>

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.417
<i>David...</i>

02:10:44.086 --> 02:10:46.629
<i>...you've had so little of that.</i>

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:50.633
If you want for my happiness...

02:10:51.802 --> 02:10:54.971
...then you know what you have to do.

02:11:00.143 --> 02:11:01.435
<i>Listen.</i>

02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:05.231
<i>Can you hear that?</i>

02:11:10.237 --> 02:11:13.114
<i>The new morning has come.</i>

02:11:20.956 --> 02:11:23.332
<i>Go to her, David.</i>

02:11:26.044 --> 02:11:29.130
<i>She's just waking up this instant.</i>

02:13:07.938 --> 02:13:10.022
I found you.

02:13:14.861 --> 02:13:19.490
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:13:20.784 --> 02:13:23.494
I must have dozed off.

02:13:25.789 --> 02:13:28.874
- How long...?
- Would you like some coffee?

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:31.377
Just the way you like it?

02:13:32.421 --> 02:13:35.131
Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

02:13:36.591 --> 02:13:38.759
It'll wake me up.

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:45.057
Okay.

02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:06.454
You never forget how, do you?

02:14:07.956 --> 02:14:09.165
No.

02:14:11.293 --> 02:14:13.127
I never forget.

02:14:18.633 --> 02:14:21.177
I must be a little confused.

02:14:22.304 --> 02:14:24.055
What day is it?

02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:29.977
It is today.

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:36.692
<i>As the day wore on, David thought
it was the happiest day of his life.</i>

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:42.031
<i>All the problems seemed to have
disappeared from his mommy's mind.</i>

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.118
<i>There was no Henry, there was no Martin.</i>

02:14:46.328 --> 02:14:50.081
<i>There was no grief.
There was only David.</i>

02:15:00.967 --> 02:15:03.728
<i>David had been warned
not to explain anything to Monica...</i>

02:15:03.887 --> 02:15:07.431
<i>...otherwise she'd be frightened,
and everything would be spoiled.</i>

02:15:07.682 --> 02:15:10.434
<i>But David's journey home
belonged only to him.</i>

02:15:10.644 --> 02:15:15.689
<i>So he didn't see the harm of painting her
pictures of things she'd have no memory of.</i>

02:15:43.135 --> 02:15:45.136
<i>David had never had a birthday party...</i>

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:46.971
<i>...because David had never been born.</i>

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:50.224
<i>So they baked a cake
and lit some candles.</i>

02:15:50.475 --> 02:15:54.603
- Now make a wish.
- It came true already.

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:03.237
<i>By now, indeed,
the windows were beginning to dim.</i>

02:16:03.446 --> 02:16:08.576
<i>David drew the shades without
even needing to be asked.</i>

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:20.254
I really ought to be tucking you in.

02:16:20.964 --> 02:16:22.965
How strange.

02:16:25.594 --> 02:16:26.635
Hmm.

02:16:27.262 --> 02:16:29.388
How fascinating.

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:37.396
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

02:16:37.897 --> 02:16:40.648
I don't know what's come over me.

02:16:46.323 --> 02:16:49.116
Such a beautiful day.

02:16:51.827 --> 02:16:53.954
I love you, David.

02:17:00.128 --> 02:17:02.379
I do love you.

02:17:03.965 --> 02:17:07.675
I have always loved you.

02:17:11.138 --> 02:17:15.308
<i>That was the everlasting
moment he had been waiting for.</i>

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:22.358
<i>And the moment had passed,
for Monica was sound asleep.</i>

02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.361
<i>More than merely asleep.</i>

02:17:27.197 --> 02:17:30.574
<i>Should he shake her,
she would never rouse.</i>

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:37.331
<i>So David went to sleep too.</i>

02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:42.878
<i>And for the first time in his life...</i>

02:17:43.546 --> 02:17:46.298
<i>...he went to that place...</i>

02:17:46.841 --> 02:17:50.718
<i>...where dreams are born.</i>
