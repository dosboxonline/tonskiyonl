WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:05.964
Ta-da!

00:06.089 --> 00:09.760
My outfit for next week's
annual Smith family trip

00:09.843 --> 00:11.178
to the dude ranch.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.473
When Klaus join Village People?

00:14.556 --> 00:16.517
Oh, my God,
did you hear that?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.603
My precious Rogu's
first sick burn.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.396
But strong disagree.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.273
Klaus is working that outfit.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.816
Give us a little spin, Klaus.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.571
Yeah, yeah, now give us
an over-the-shoulder.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.407
Now give us, like, a...

00:32.491 --> 00:34.618
like someone deciding
what to get on the menu.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.287
Okay, I'm good.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.331
Does anybody else want
Klaus to do something?

00:39.414 --> 00:43.001
Rogu, Klaus can wear
anything he wants to the dude ranch.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.586
He crushes it there.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.547
I'm good at all their activities,

00:46.630 --> 00:48.924
and I love eating
from the chuck wagon.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.760
They flavor the beans with just
the right amount of trail dust.

00:51.844 --> 00:52.970
Tons.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.305
Ugh, I hate all that dust.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.974
It fogs up my glasses.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.392
Steve is right, Rogu.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.061
We all have something we love
about the dude ranch.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.773
For example, I, Stan,
am excited to be reunited

01:04.857 --> 01:06.733
with the ranch's tequila mule...

01:06.817 --> 01:08.193
Tequila Joe.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.112
He's easily my best friend.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.905
Francine, isn't he
my best friend?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.699
Oh, for sure, Stan,

01:13.782 --> 01:15.826
but you'll see
when you get there, Rogu.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.327
You invited Rogu?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.413
Yeah, Francine and I
have a bet going on

01:19.496 --> 01:21.498
whether or not he can
herd cattle better than a dog.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.000
Rogu's just gonna
eat the cattle.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.210
And the dog.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.096
I hope this is the year
I get to ride Tequila Joe.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.433
But Mr. S, no one has
ever ridden Tequila Joe.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.726
He's untamable.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.395
Jeff, why is it that
you only ever open your mouth

01:43.478 --> 01:44.855
to shit on my dreams?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.441
Go inside. You're not coming
to the dude ranch.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.525
Babe?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.819
Maybe next time no talking
till we get there.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.240
Very funny, Steve.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.868
Now put me in my spot
on the center console.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.536
Can't. Rogu's sitting there.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.706
My hat! My spot!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.708
He's taking all my things!

02:04.833 --> 02:06.627
Relax, Klaus.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.087
That outfit looks way
better on him.

02:09.171 --> 02:11.131
And no one's gonna see you
in the back.

02:11.215 --> 02:14.259
Ugh! Is everyone
obsessed with Rogu?

02:14.343 --> 02:18.555
Rogu!
I almost didn't get to say goodbye!

02:19.723 --> 02:21.475
Et tu, Billy?

02:30.651 --> 02:31.985
Tequila Joe!

02:32.194 --> 02:34.279
Sorry I was gone
for a whole year.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.823
My stupid family
won't let me live here.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.243
Huh, not as dusty
as I remember.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.871
I'm gonna find
a Kleenex.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.832
Ah, there's Nowell,
the main ranch hand.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.167
He's my boy!

02:47.334 --> 02:49.545
Rogu, try not to be jealous
when he calls me

02:49.628 --> 02:51.713
by my nickname...
Buckaroo.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.090
Howdy, Smiths!

02:53.173 --> 02:55.384
Welcome back
to the Octuple J.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.636
Hey, Buckaroo!
How you doing?

02:57.719 --> 03:00.305
So good.
Bet you're stoked that...

03:00.389 --> 03:03.559
And who's this little monster
you brought with you, Buckaroo?

03:03.642 --> 03:06.270
Ugh, that's Rogu.
Gross, right?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.604
He's adorable.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.189
I'm gonna give him a nickname.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.441
Not Buckaroo.
That's what I call everybody.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.402
I know! Buckarito!

03:13.610 --> 03:15.487
Buck-a-rogu.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.656
That's great,
but I'm going to do mine.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.491
Let me show you all
to your cabins.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.579
I'm gonna bury you, suckarito.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.997
Suckarito.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.457
Haven't heard that term
in a long time.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.251
If I remember correctly,
it's where

03:29.334 --> 03:32.254
one guy chugs margaritas
while I blow him.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.672
And then...

03:34.131 --> 03:35.215
that's it I think.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.427
Yeah. Yeah, I am
remembering that correctly.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.853
Great job, buckaroo!

03:47.936 --> 03:50.564
Man, if you told me that someday
I would meet a fish

03:50.647 --> 03:53.483
who could talk and was good
at roping, I woulda...

03:53.567 --> 03:55.652
Whoa, look at Buckarito!

04:04.620 --> 04:07.164
Ha! Beat that, Suckarito.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.626
Oh!

04:12.085 --> 04:13.378
Great shot, Rogu.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.422
You hit the cook
right in his noot sack.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.634
Cook? I'm the got-dang sommelier!

04:18.717 --> 04:20.886
But your name is Cookie, right?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.304
Yes, it is.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.306
And you are the cook?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.808
-Yes.
-Then what are you mad about?

04:26.892 --> 04:30.103
I reckon it's the horseshoe
you threw into my balls.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.564
Ugh, you gonna hold
that over us forever?

04:32.648 --> 04:33.982
It was a joke, dude.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.820
Nine seconds!

04:38.904 --> 04:40.614
A new Octuple J record.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.535
Hold your horses!
Buckarito's at 15 seconds and counting.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.960
Wow, I wouldn't even
think to do it that way.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.253
What's Rogu doing?

04:54.503 --> 04:55.754
What are we laughing at?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.844
Ladies to the middle
and back to the bar

05:01.927 --> 05:03.846
Gents go in
with a right-hand star

05:05.889 --> 05:07.808
Now everyone make
way for ol' Rogu

05:07.891 --> 05:09.935
He's the star
of this hullabaloo

05:10.018 --> 05:11.895
Oh, yeah!

05:12.354 --> 05:14.606
What does he have that I don't?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.774
Nothing!

05:15.858 --> 05:17.693
I guess he has
that Nintendo Switch

05:17.776 --> 05:20.320
with basically all the games,
but that's all.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.573
Do-si-do, two by two

05:22.656 --> 05:24.449
Everyone kiss Rogu

05:24.533 --> 05:26.702
Who am I kidding?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.704
He's a shooting star.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.290
I have to do something.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.084
Kiss Rogu once again

05:34.168 --> 05:35.961
But this time,
just the men

05:38.463 --> 05:40.716
No!

05:44.928 --> 05:45.929
Aah!

05:48.182 --> 05:50.267
Tequila Joe is gone!

05:50.350 --> 05:52.686
Someone cut his rope,
and he wandered off.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.855
I knew I shouldn't have
left him alone.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.149
But you just had to bone!

05:57.858 --> 05:58.859
A switchblade?

06:00.027 --> 06:02.613
That's probably what they used
to cut the rope.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.573
Does it say
whose property it is?

06:04.656 --> 06:07.075
It says, "Property of Ragu."

06:07.159 --> 06:10.913
Uh, I'm pretty sure it says,
"Property of Rogu."

06:10.996 --> 06:15.125
Wait, Klaus, how do you think
you spell Rogu?

06:15.209 --> 06:17.544
R-A?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.838
-What did you do?
-Easy, buckaroo.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.299
Now, we may never get
to the bottom

06:22.382 --> 06:24.384
of who cut Tequila Joe loose,

06:24.468 --> 06:27.012
but it was definitely
either Klaus or Buckarito,

06:27.095 --> 06:28.722
charming little devil
that he is.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.265
So they're gonna have to go

06:30.349 --> 06:31.767
into the wilderness
to find him.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.520
What? I don't want to go
out there with him.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.189
Well, you should've thought
of that before you freed

06:37.272 --> 06:38.899
or didn't free Tequila Joe.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.026
Seems pretty obvious
it was Klaus.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.819
It's not obvious to me.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.197
Let the wilderness decide!

06:47.074 --> 06:50.035
Well, Rogu, this is quite
the bowl of shit sandwich

06:50.118 --> 06:51.286
you got us into.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.663
Me?

06:52.955 --> 06:55.749
Klaus one who frame...

06:55.832 --> 06:57.251
Klaus one who framed Rogu.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.378
Why do you talk
so freaking slow, bro?

06:59.461 --> 07:01.588
- Rogu talk faster.
- What?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.632
You could do that
this whole time?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.425
Rogu learn English
one year ago.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.386
Rogu careful
no make mistakes.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.388
Plus, Rogu talk slow,

07:09.471 --> 07:12.724
charm pants off ladies.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.691
Almost lunch,
and no sign of Tequila Joe.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.278
If we don't find a way to track him,
we're gonna be out here all night.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.405
Tequila Joe!

07:27.072 --> 07:28.866
Oh, Rogu dance
on the Rogu

07:28.949 --> 07:30.617
And Rogu, Rogu a Rogu

07:30.701 --> 07:32.369
And the Rogu
Rogu on a Rogu

07:32.452 --> 07:34.162
And Rogu does Rogu
on hats

07:34.246 --> 07:36.248
Ole.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.292
There you are!

07:39.293 --> 07:40.919
Now, let's get out of here.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.546
Fastest way is to ride.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.091
But Tequila Joe
famously unrideable.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.844
That's only because
I've never tried.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.263
Aah!

07:51.889 --> 07:52.931
Damn it!

07:53.015 --> 07:54.391
You spooked him, Rogu!

07:54.474 --> 07:59.021
Rogu die never seeing
Ant Man & Wasp!

08:00.105 --> 08:01.106
He's gone.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.275
Thank you, Tequila Joe.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.319
I'm free...

08:06.862 --> 08:08.864
Help!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.490
I can't swim
in this much water!

08:10.574 --> 08:12.618
I'm used to way less water!

08:19.917 --> 08:21.710
Dry land.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.129
Dry land!
I need water!

08:24.213 --> 08:25.797
I need just the right amount
of water!

08:30.177 --> 08:31.178
Thanks, Rogu.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.472
Klaus do same for Rogu.

08:33.555 --> 08:34.556
Maybe.

08:35.224 --> 08:36.225
Where are we?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.310
Klaus and Rogu lost?

08:38.435 --> 08:39.436
Yes.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.104
We're a long way
from the ranch,

08:41.188 --> 08:43.649
and we'll have to work together
to find our way back.

08:43.732 --> 08:44.983
Yay!

08:45.067 --> 08:48.070
Klaus and Rogu
go on adventure!

08:48.153 --> 08:50.656
Well, I don't like it
any more than you do, Rogu.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.825
For the talent show,
my brother and I

08:53.909 --> 08:57.162
are going to perform
the shark scene from Jaws.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.373
I don't remember a shark
in that movie.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.166
Everyone imagine
in your heads

09:01.250 --> 09:04.378
John Williams' iconic theme
from Jaws.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.796
I can't hum it out loud

09:05.879 --> 09:08.298
because Universal's lawyers
are always watching.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.386
It's like they're
the real sharks.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.139
How can you laugh
at a time like this?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.808
Tequila Joe is missing!

09:17.891 --> 09:19.518
Stan, there's no need to worry.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.854
-These mountains aren't that dangerous.
-Really?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.605
Except of course for
that pair of

09:23.689 --> 09:26.316
mountain lions that
are terrorizing the region.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.485
Yeah, Klaus, Rogu,
and Tequila Joe

09:28.569 --> 09:31.113
would make a hell of a snack
for those two love birds.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.197
Oh, God!

09:32.281 --> 09:34.616
I think they're boyfriend/girlfriend.
Isn't that sweet?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.994
Well, I'm not gonna sit around
watching a talent show

09:37.077 --> 09:38.662
while Tequila Joe is in danger.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.373
I'm gonna sit around outside
and worry about him.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.293
I did like your skit about
the farting cowboy, Gerhard.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.419
Danke.

09:46.461 --> 09:50.382
I feel like someone should tell
Billy that Rogu's missing.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.718
Thank you, Franny.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.597
Please call if you hear anything.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.188
Are you safe, Rogu?

10:05.063 --> 10:07.399
Oh, where are you

10:07.482 --> 10:10.194
My sweet Rogu?

10:10.402 --> 10:15.532
I hear you're lost
and scared

10:15.991 --> 10:21.330
I pray that soon
I'll hear you say

10:21.413 --> 10:27.252
"Billy, I'm okay"

10:28.253 --> 10:30.797
Oh, where are you

10:30.881 --> 10:33.342
My sweet Rogu?

10:33.425 --> 10:38.096
I know you're
probably scared

10:41.642 --> 10:46.230
Where did you go,
Tequila Joe?

10:46.313 --> 10:50.234
I miss the timeswe shared

10:56.490 --> 11:02.204
- I hope that you are found
-BILLY: I hope that you are found

11:02.287 --> 11:07.459
-Or that you're homeward bound
-Or that you're homeward bound

11:08.168 --> 11:14.007
-You'll come back, I know
-You'll come back, I know

11:14.091 --> 11:21.098
-My sweet Ro-Gu
-Tequila Joe

11:22.766 --> 11:28.397
Hee-haaaaw

11:29.857 --> 11:33.569
Okay, marry the potato skins
from TGI Friday's,

11:33.652 --> 11:36.363
kill the vegetable soup
from Olive Garden,

11:36.446 --> 11:39.241
and the baby back ribs
from Chili's.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.160
Rogu all.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.122
Wait, this is where
we fell into the river.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.206
We're almost home.

11:52.671 --> 11:56.008
This is exactly how that fortune teller
in Reno said I would die.

11:56.091 --> 12:01.054
Which means the Nuggets will win
the 2026 NBA championship.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.140
The people of Denver
will be so happy!

12:13.525 --> 12:14.860
Klaus hurt?

12:16.778 --> 12:17.821
I'm fine.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.865
But it's been a long day.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.702
Maybe we make camp and pass out
from the pain here tonight?

12:27.164 --> 12:30.542
I have to say, between that hawk,
that mountain lion,

12:30.626 --> 12:32.252
and that stink bug I killed,

12:32.336 --> 12:35.923
I'm not sure either of us
could've made it without the other.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.425
Maybe you're not so bad, Rogu.

12:38.509 --> 12:41.637
That mean lot to Rogu
from Klaus.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.804
It does?

12:42.888 --> 12:44.932
Rogu look up to Klaus.

12:45.349 --> 12:49.645
When Rogu get to Smiths,
Rogu see Klaus have place.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.356
Bottom rung of ladder.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.609
But Rogu not know
how Rogu fit in.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.486
But everyone loves you, bro.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.405
Sure, Rogu naturally charming.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.243
But truth, Rogu like duck.

13:04.326 --> 13:08.872
Calm on surface,
but under, furiously paddling.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.458
Wow, I had no idea.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.212
You know, I'm glad we ended up
out here together.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.464
Rogu glad, too.

13:17.548 --> 13:20.717
And Rogu ain't "lion."

13:24.096 --> 13:25.931
Physical comedy, too.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.101
You're the whole package, Rogu.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.478
Rogu have idea.

13:31.770 --> 13:36.400
Now that friends, maybe Klaus
call Rogu "Bro-gu"?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.653
Dude, self-given nicknames
are embarrassing.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.781
That would be like if I told you
to call me K-Money.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.826
Oh, my God!
How good does that sound?

13:45.909 --> 13:48.120
Rogu, you got to start
calling me K-Money.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.416
Rogu!

13:55.252 --> 13:57.504
Klaus help Rogu!

13:57.754 --> 13:58.755
I'll get the rope.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.677
Here's the thing.

14:04.428 --> 14:08.182
I have learned a lot about you
on this trip, Rogu.

14:08.265 --> 14:11.518
You have depth and feelings,
and you're useful.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.478
And I'm not.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.356
I'm not worried
you're going to replace me.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.983
I know you will.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.069
Klaus not help Rogu?

14:21.153 --> 14:22.154
No.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.363
I'm betraying you.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.032
Rogu no like.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.951
We have words
after Rogu climb out.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.419
Why did you ask for help
if you could climb that easily?

14:37.503 --> 14:40.756
That! That's exactly the kind
of thing that got you betrayed.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.550
Uh, I mean, joke betrayed.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.601
Betrayal back on!

14:52.684 --> 14:54.978
Thank God for loose rocks, huh?

14:55.062 --> 14:57.397
Okay, bye forever, Rogu.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.151
K-Money!

15:07.783 --> 15:10.869
It's so sad that after
you saved Rogu from the hawk

15:10.953 --> 15:12.371
and that mountain lion...

15:12.454 --> 15:14.706
-Don't forget the stink bug.
-After all that,

15:14.790 --> 15:16.208
you couldn't
save him from the river.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.334
I tried.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.961
But he was swept away.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.171
He's gone, bros.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.048
We're just glad you're okay, Klaus.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.758
Who cares about Klaus?

15:24.842 --> 15:26.593
Tequila Joe is out there,

15:26.677 --> 15:28.929
and he's bound to be
out of tequila by now.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.598
He's just some donkey named Joe!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.936
I can't believe Rogu's gone.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.648
Oh, we'll have a bar crawl
in his honor!

15:39.731 --> 15:41.608
Maybe do
a Great Gatsby theme?

15:41.692 --> 15:43.861
Everyone can dress up
and act rich.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.529
You rest, Klaus.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.613
Try to eat.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.334
You left Rogu to die.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.004
I... I had to! He... he would've...

16:02.546 --> 16:05.257
Oh, God, what have I done, pancakes?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.467
Klaus, are you talking
to your pancakes?

16:07.551 --> 16:10.387
Here I am in the hallway
talking to my pancakes.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.223
-Mind if we join?
-Roger, I...

16:13.974 --> 16:15.726
Rogu didn't drown.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.229
He fell into a mine shaft,
and I left him there!

16:19.313 --> 16:21.440
So, Rogu is alive?

16:21.523 --> 16:24.985
Yes!
We have to save him!

16:25.068 --> 16:27.821
Klaus, there's no easy way
to say this.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.239
You should've killed him.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.950
-Wait, what?
-Look, I'm happy my son's alive,

16:32.034 --> 16:34.286
although I'm more than
a little embarrassed to cancel

16:34.369 --> 16:36.580
his Mardi Gras-themed
memorial bar crawl

16:36.663 --> 16:38.332
five minutes
after sending out the E-vite,

16:38.415 --> 16:41.210
but no one betrays Rogu
and lives to tell the tale.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.544
But he's trapped.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.254
His arm is pinned
under a rock.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.924
So? He could chew through
that thing in two seconds.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.008
Watch.

16:48.217 --> 16:51.386
And our kind can regenerate
limbs practically at will.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.520
Hmm, it's usually
pretty fast.

16:59.603 --> 17:00.979
Oh, well, it'll grow back.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.650
But make no mistake,
Rogu is coming for you.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.528
Rogu's already here?

17:07.611 --> 17:08.820
Could be a coincidence.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.199
Nope, that's Rogu.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.117
He loves shooting people
in the nuts.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.702
He's not wrong, it's funny.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.831
Great bit, Rogu. Keep it up.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.835
Take cover!

17:23.460 --> 17:24.837
What the hell is going on?

17:24.920 --> 17:26.421
Rogu's trying to kill Klaus.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.465
Rogu's alive?

17:28.549 --> 17:30.926
Yep, Klaus left Rogu
to die in a pit,

17:31.009 --> 17:33.387
and now Rogu cut his arm off
and is gonna kill Klaus.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.848
You know, I had a feeling
that's what happened.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.891
Now he's pissed,
and he's gonna kill us all.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.601
We should probably say
our goodbyes.

17:39.685 --> 17:40.811
Goodbye, Roger.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.604
You're the only one
I'm gonna miss,

17:42.688 --> 17:45.858
and I can easily say you're
the funniest out of everybody.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.527
I think the shooting stopped.

17:51.405 --> 17:53.907
Rogu seek parlay.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.371
Rogu show he mean business.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.623
Now want Klaus.

18:01.707 --> 18:03.542
Let rest live.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.879
Welp, I know where I stand.

18:06.962 --> 18:08.672
Stay right there, Klaus.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.883
You can't have him, Rogu.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.342
Klaus is family.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.678
Klaus is family.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.389
-I am?
-Klaus, did you really think

18:17.472 --> 18:19.933
we hate you so much
we'd let you die?

18:20.017 --> 18:22.102
You need to work
on your self-esteem, man.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.229
Your funeral.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.982
Rogu come back tonight.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.067
No mercy.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.987
See ya then, Rogu.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.739
Look, Klaus, it grew back.

18:37.826 --> 18:42.164
Klaus come to face Rogu by self?

18:43.540 --> 18:45.000
This is between me and you.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.294
They don't need to suffer
for what I've done.

18:47.377 --> 18:51.840
Klaus noble and stupid.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.176
Any last words?

18:54.259 --> 18:55.302
Yes.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.554
When the family
wouldn't give me up,

18:57.638 --> 19:00.307
I realized maybe they do like me.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.893
Which means there's room
for both of us,

19:02.976 --> 19:04.645
and I was a fool to betray

19:04.728 --> 19:07.981
one of the most special creatures
I've ever met.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.441
Billy?

19:09.525 --> 19:11.777
You, Bro-gu.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.029
I will face the consequences,

19:14.112 --> 19:18.492
but I want you to know
that I am truly sorry.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.410
Wow.

19:20.494 --> 19:24.206
Mean a lot to Rogu
that you learn lesson.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.874
Oh, good. I'm glad...

19:25.958 --> 19:27.709
Before you die.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.961
Seriously?

19:29.044 --> 19:32.172
But I apologized,
like super sincerely!

19:32.256 --> 19:37.511
Yes, but also leave Rogu to die
in mine shaft, so...

19:37.594 --> 19:39.137
eh, uh.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.143
A second mountain lion?
I wonder if they know each other.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.611
Told you I was good
at dude ranch stuff.

19:54.987 --> 19:59.408
Klaus save Rogu even though
Rogu plan kill Klaus?

19:59.491 --> 20:01.493
You're family, too.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.954
Klaus still die.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.205
Are you kidding me?

20:05.289 --> 20:07.207
But where Klaus dick?

20:07.291 --> 20:10.878
Rogu need
magnifying glass to find.

20:13.881 --> 20:16.049
That is not funny, Rogu!

20:16.133 --> 20:18.594
It's little funny.

20:18.677 --> 20:19.970
O-Okay, it's a little funny.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.138
It's a little funny.

20:23.182 --> 20:26.435
I'm so happy you two managed
to work things out

20:26.518 --> 20:27.769
without anyone getting hurt.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.898
Uh, Mom, all those ranch dudes
got shot in the dick.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.482
Can you guys give me a second?

20:35.569 --> 20:37.070
Well, we're on our way.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.616
I know I can't ride you,
but maybe I can...

20:41.200 --> 20:42.242
hug you?

20:43.785 --> 20:44.828
Thank you.

20:45.621 --> 20:46.830
This is nice.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.137
When will...

21:02.304 --> 21:03.764
Have a great night!
