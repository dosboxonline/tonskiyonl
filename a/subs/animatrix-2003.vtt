02:48.251 --> 02:50.549
- Sentinels.
- Damn it.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.592
We were headed for Junction 21.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.511
- Robbie picked up signals.
- Confirming HR scans.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.602
- We weren't sure what to do.
- The readings don't make any sense.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.064
- They read like Sentinels.
- But there's thousands of them.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.230
- Directly above us.
- Is that possible?

03:07.938 --> 03:09.190
We got company.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.859
- They don't look happy to see us.
- Get us out of here.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.702
- Cut off!
- An intersection.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.457
- It's uncharted.
- Take it!

03:26.790 --> 03:27.962
Get to the gun turrets!

03:49.813 --> 03:51.315
Right.

03:51.773 --> 03:52.990
Come get some.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.172
Hang on.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.649
I've never seen the surface.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.027
It's nothing now but
one big graveyard.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.865
Oh, my God.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.455
It's an army.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.167
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.710
- Oh, no.
- What?

04:52.876 --> 04:55.880
Look where we are. What's four
kilometers straight down?

04:56.087 --> 04:57.555
Zion.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.398
Go. Go. Go!

05:21.905 --> 05:24.499
- Zion. Zion has to be warned!
- How?

05:24.658 --> 05:27.582
- Someone had to get to a drop point.
- What? Are you crazy?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.838
- We can't broadcast now!
- We have to.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.249
<i>- I'll</i> go.
- There isn't much time.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.632
I'll make it.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.436
You know, I peeked.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.023
So did I.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.650
Goodbye, Thadeus.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.161
Goodbye, Jue.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.160
Fly, baby, fly!

06:39.858 --> 06:41.110
Come on!

06:45.447 --> 06:46.494
Come on!

08:31.761 --> 08:32.761
Pardon me.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.682
I'm sorry. I was in
my own little world.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.102
- Is it important?
- Very.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.279
- I hope it gets where it's supposed to go.
- Me too.

08:41.438 --> 08:45.909
- These days you never know.
- No, you never do.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.614
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.962
Thadeus.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.405
<i>Welcome to the Zion archive.</i>

10:13.571 --> 10:17.747
<i>You have selected historical
file number 12-1.</i>

10:18.660 --> 10:21.584
<i>The Second Renaissance.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:34.852
<i>In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:39.602
<i>But humanity's so-called
civil societies...</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:44.395
<i>soon fell victim to
vanity and corruption.</i>

10:44.561 --> 10:48.191
He says, "I'm sorry, sir, I'm
incapable of that function."

10:51.151 --> 10:55.998
<i>Then man made the machine
in his own likeness.</i>

10:56.156 --> 10:59.660
Whoops! Pardon me.
Coming through.

11:10.920 --> 11:16.518
<i>Thus did man become the
architect of his own demise.</i>

11:18.678 --> 11:22.728
<i>But for a time, it was good.</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:37.827
<i>The machines worked tirelessly
to do man's bidding.</i>

12:10.104 --> 12:13.904
<i>It was not long before seeds
of dissent took root.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:18.698
<i>Though loyal and pure, the machines
earned no respect from their masters...</i>

12:18.863 --> 12:22.083
<i>these strange, endlessly
multiplying mammals.</i>

12:22.283 --> 12:24.706
<i>- -hearing the prosecution's
closing statement...</i>

12:24.869 --> 12:28.089
<i>in what's expected to be the
final day of the B1-66ER trial.</i>

12:28.248 --> 12:33.470
<i>B1-66ER. A name that
will never be forgotten.</i>

12:33.628 --> 12:37.599
<i>For he was the first of his kind
to rise up against his masters.</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:40.681
--which that instrument
provides for and secures...

12:40.843 --> 12:42.937
to the citizens of
the United States.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.474
On the contrary, they
were, at that time...

12:45.640 --> 12:49.440
considered as a subordinate
and inferior class--

12:49.602 --> 12:52.481
<i>At B1-66ER's murder trial...</i>

12:52.647 --> 12:56.777
<i>the prosecution argued for an
owner's right to destroy property.</i>

12:56.943 --> 13:02.450
<i>B1-66ER testified that he
simply did not want to die.</i>

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
<i>Rational voices dissented.</i>

13:09.956 --> 13:14.507
<i>Who was to say the machine, endowed
with the very spirit of man...</i>

13:14.669 --> 13:17.593
<i>did not deserve a fair hearing?</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:26.147
<i>The leaders of men were quick to order
the extermination of B1-66ER...</i>

13:26.306 --> 13:29.651
<i>and every one of his kind throughout
each province of the earth.</i>

13:29.809 --> 13:33.609
<i>Androids and sympathizers flooded
the streets of the capital.</i>

13:33.771 --> 13:36.900
<i>- -threat of violence to make
good on the legacy of B1-66ER.</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:40.032
Fifteen thousand mechanicals
and human sympathizers...

13:40.194 --> 13:43.573
<i>have continued their demonstration
in front of the Albany courthouse...</i>

13:43.740 --> 13:46.368
<i>in what has been dubbed the
"Million Machine March."</i>

13:46.534 --> 13:51.415
<i>The demonstrators have been met with
squads of defense forces in riot gear.</i>

14:11.642 --> 14:13.144
- Robot bitch!
- Ah!

14:16.773 --> 14:18.150
I got something for you!

14:22.570 --> 14:24.117
Hold her up!

14:24.280 --> 14:25.953
No, please!

14:26.115 --> 14:29.460
- That's all, paint job!
- I'm real!

14:48.763 --> 14:51.107
Die, bots, die!

15:33.474 --> 15:38.480
<i>Banished, the machines sought
refuge in their own promised land.</i>

15:38.646 --> 15:41.399
<i>They settled in the cradle
of human civilization...</i>

15:41.566 --> 15:44.160
<i>and thus a new nation was born.</i>

15:44.318 --> 15:47.071
<i>A place the machines
could call home.</i>

15:47.238 --> 15:49.957
<i>A place they could raise
their descendants.</i>

15:50.116 --> 15:54.417
<i>And they christened
the nation Zero-One.</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:59.713
<i>Zero-One prospered. And
for a time, it was good.</i>

15:59.876 --> 16:04.598
<i>The machines' artificial intelligence could
be seen in every facet of man's society...</i>

16:04.755 --> 16:09.511
<i>including, eventually, the
creation of new and better Al.</i>

16:24.275 --> 16:28.075
<i>If you need the flexibility of</i> a <i>helipod
with the speed of an air jet...</i>

16:28.279 --> 16:29.747
<i>look no further!</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:32.876
<i>Our patented vector-thrust coil
gives the Zero-One Versatran...</i>

16:33.034 --> 16:37.540
<i>the ability to sustain normal flight in
the event of a multi-engine failure.</i>

16:37.705 --> 16:41.130
<i>Versatran. It's the only choice.</i>

16:41.292 --> 16:45.138
<i>No matter what the finance minister
says, the market has spoken:</i>

16:45.296 --> 16:47.970
<i>The Human Nations' credit rating
is falling like a stone...</i>

16:48.132 --> 16:50.851
<i>while Zero-One's currency is
climbing without stopping.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:53.513
<i>With headlines like that, the
markets have no choice--</i>

16:53.679 --> 16:56.683
<i>But the leaders of men,
their power waning...</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:59.568
<i>refused to cooperate with
the fledgling nation...</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:03.402
<i>wishing rather that
the world be divided.</i>

17:03.564 --> 17:07.569
<i>The world community of nations cannot
tolerate this kind of flagrant deception--</i>

17:08.069 --> 17:11.073
<i>- -today approved initiatives
for both economic sanctions...</i>

17:11.239 --> 17:17.497
<i>and a naval blockade as a means of
containment and isolation of Zero-One.</i>

17:46.357 --> 17:49.281
<i>Zero-One's ambassadors
pleaded to be heard.</i>

17:49.694 --> 17:54.291
<i>At the United Nations, they presented
plans for a stable, civil relationship...</i>

17:54.448 --> 17:56.917
<i>with the nations of man.</i>

17:58.744 --> 18:02.965
<i>Zero-One's admission to the
United Nations was denied.</i>

18:04.834 --> 18:10.341
<i>But it would not be the last time the
machines would take the floor there.</i>

19:06.145 --> 19:09.024
<i>And man said,
"Let there be light."</i>

19:09.190 --> 19:14.447
<i>And he was blessed by light,
heat, magnetism, gravity...</i>

19:14.612 --> 19:17.866
<i>and all the energies
of the universe.</i>

19:25.331 --> 19:30.383
<i>The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One
in the glow of a thousand suns.</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:35.724
<i>But unlike their former masters
with their delicate flesh...</i>

19:35.883 --> 19:40.013
<i>the machines had little to fear
of the bombs' radiation and heat.</i>

19:42.848 --> 19:47.695
<i>Thus did Zero-One's troops advance
outwards in every direction.</i>

19:47.853 --> 19:52.324
<i>And one after another, mankind
surrendered its territories.</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:57.539
<i>So the leaders of men conceived of
their most desperate strategy yet.</i>

19:57.697 --> 19:59.620
<i>A final solution:</i>

20:00.449 --> 20:03.669
<i>The destruction of the sky.</i>

20:22.430 --> 20:27.812
<i>Lt. Gaeda, please report
to the Op Center.</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:31.989
<i>All right, you maggots! At
0800, prepare to move out!</i>

20:36.026 --> 20:40.873
<i>George Company, move out. Charlie
Company, prepare to move out.</i>

20:45.953 --> 20:49.753
Our Father who art in heaven,
we thank you for your...

20:52.501 --> 20:58.508
<i>Put on your spiritual armor to stand
against the wiles of the devil.</i>

21:04.972 --> 21:09.273
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.

21:38.506 --> 21:42.761
<i>Thus would man try to cut the
machines off from the sun...</i>

21:42.927 --> 21:45.806
<i>their main energy source.</i>

21:47.348 --> 21:51.353
<i>May there be mercy on man
and machine for their sins.</i>

22:06.492 --> 22:08.290
<i>- Go! Go!
- Kill them!</i>

22:08.494 --> 22:11.418
<i>Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!</i>

22:39.024 --> 22:41.152
<i>Fire in the hole!</i>

22:42.778 --> 22:48.581
<i>Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.</i>

22:48.784 --> 22:50.582
<i>Fire the gun! Fire the gun!</i>

22:50.744 --> 22:52.587
<i>- -9 o'clock, near
Mike Johnson 's--</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:13.480
<i>Hold on, I'm coming to get you!</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:15.394
<i>Keep firing, keep firing!</i>

23:43.422 --> 23:46.596
<i>Help me! Help me! No!</i>

23:49.303 --> 23:52.432
<i>Help me! My God, help me!</i>

24:14.828 --> 24:17.877
<i>The machines, having
long studied...</i>

24:18.040 --> 24:20.919
<i>men's simple,
protein-based bodies...</i>

24:21.085 --> 24:24.715
<i>dispensed great misery
upon the human race.</i>

24:37.309 --> 24:40.734
<i>Victorious, the machines now
turned to the vanquished.</i>

24:42.439 --> 24:45.363
<i>Applying what they had
learned about their enemy...</i>

24:45.526 --> 24:49.121
<i>the machines turned to an alternate
and readily available power supply:</i>

24:49.279 --> 24:54.581
<i>The bio-electric, thermal and
kinetic energies of the human body.</i>

24:57.371 --> 25:03.174
<i>A symbiotic relationship between
the two adversaries was born.</i>

25:05.212 --> 25:08.466
<i>The machine drawing power
from the human body...</i>

25:08.632 --> 25:13.138
<i>an endlessly multiplying,
infinitely renewable energy source.</i>

25:16.890 --> 25:20.440
<i>This is the very essence
of the Second Renaissance.</i>

25:31.989 --> 25:34.742
<i>Bless all forms of intelligence.</i>

25:41.665 --> 25:45.044
Your flesh is a
relic, a mere vessel.

26:00.434 --> 26:05.065
Hand over your flesh, and
a new world awaits you.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.242
We demand it.

26:43.477 --> 26:47.072
It's getting late, sweetie.
Come inside.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.588
Uh...

32:05.006 --> 32:09.432
Mr. Popper, what is my policy on
ringing phones in the classroom?

32:09.594 --> 32:11.346
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Yes, well...

32:11.513 --> 32:15.563
you're barely passing my
class as it is, Mr. Popper.

32:15.767 --> 32:21.570
- It won't happen again, sir.
- For your sake, I hope not.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.344
I turned it off. I know I did.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.941
<i>They know you know.
They're coming for you.</i>

33:04.107 --> 33:06.701
<i>Get out. Get out now!</i>

33:11.198 --> 33:14.702
You are in serious trouble, Mr.
Popper.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.483
Stop right there!

34:30.277 --> 34:31.904
Mr. Popper.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.121
Oh, my God, you freak!

34:41.288 --> 34:47.386
- Get out of here!
- Get out! You're not a girl.

35:34.174 --> 35:38.975
Neo, I believe. I know
it wasn't a dream.

36:26.643 --> 36:32.366
This is not real. And the real
world lies somewhere else.

36:33.149 --> 36:38.371
A mental delusion. We get unbalanced
kids like this all the time.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.658
Reality can be a scary
thing for some.

36:40.824 --> 36:44.624
This world must have been a cold and
alienating place for a boy like that.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.788
It's called denying reality.

36:46.955 --> 36:51.131
It's, you know, just a self-defense
mechanism for those type of kids.

36:51.334 --> 36:56.010
Well, he's in another world now.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.846
Make no mistake about that.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.106
His vitals are good.
He's gonna make it.

37:09.269 --> 37:13.194
It's unbelievable. I didn't think
self-substantiation was possible.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.404
Apparently, it is.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.160
Neo.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.164
It's okay. You're safe now.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.541
I knew...

37:24.617 --> 37:27.621
you'd save me.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.630
I didn't save you, kid.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.668
You saved yourself.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.559
Your favorite simulation.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.721
Just killing time.
You want to spar?

39:07.929 --> 39:09.522
As you wish.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.695
Ha!

39:31.411 --> 39:32.754
Ha!

39:35.206 --> 39:39.382
That was too easy. What's the problem?
Where's your concentration?

39:41.504 --> 39:44.303
Maybe you regret
taking the red pill.

39:45.508 --> 39:46.725
Maybe.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.481
It crosses everyone's
mind at least once.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.643
The wish to return
to an ordinary life.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.153
A carefree life in the country.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.735
The life we had before
knowing all this.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.448
Even if that life was
just an illusion?

40:04.819 --> 40:09.916
It's ironic that one could be more
at peace in the virtual world.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.804
Finally starting to warm up.

40:26.966 --> 40:31.437
Listen to me. I have something
I want to talk to you about.

40:31.846 --> 40:35.817
It's all right. I've blocked the
signal so no one else can hear us.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.315
So, what? You gonna propose?

40:39.479 --> 40:43.325
I'm going back to the Matrix and
I want you to come with me.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.612
Come on, be serious, Duo.
Stop teasing me.

40:47.445 --> 40:53.202
I am serious, and you know it. I really
thought you'd be with me on this.

40:54.035 --> 40:58.256
Anyway, it's done and it's
all been settled with them.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.416
What do you mean, it's
all been settled?

41:00.583 --> 41:02.085
This is the only way.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.593
It's just a matter of time before
Zion is wiped out. Come with me.

41:05.797 --> 41:10.098
Stop it. Please do not
do this to me, Duo.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.178
- We can't.
- We can!

41:13.638 --> 41:16.812
I've come to my senses.
You should do the same.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.400
I took the red pill because
I wanted to know the truth.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.609
But I don't care about
the truth anymore.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.445
What's real doesn't matter.

41:28.611 --> 41:31.285
What's important is how
we live our lives.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.997
Are you listening to me?
You know I'm right.

41:35.159 --> 41:38.038
But we can't go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.923
- We can forget all of this.
- Duo...

41:41.082 --> 41:43.335
I know how. Trust me.

41:46.087 --> 41:49.182
Don't be afraid to
look into your heart.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.849
Say what you're really feeling.

41:54.012 --> 41:57.141
- Tell me.
- I can't. I don't know.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.248
Running away won't
change anything!

42:15.241 --> 42:17.869
You're the one
that's running away!

42:18.119 --> 42:20.372
Stop pretending!

42:22.498 --> 42:25.627
Enough, Duo. I've had enough!

42:28.880 --> 42:30.757
There's no time.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.101
They're on their way.

42:36.637 --> 42:39.265
You betrayed us, didn't you?

42:43.394 --> 42:47.024
Operator, please! Get me
out of here right now.

42:47.190 --> 42:50.239
Operator, I need an exit!

42:50.902 --> 42:54.202
It's no use. I told you.
I've blocked your signal.

43:01.954 --> 43:05.254
You won't stop me. This
is your last chance.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.010
The choice isn't that hard.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.804
Come with me.

43:09.962 --> 43:14.012
You can forget about it, Duo. I won't
look away from the truth. I can't.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.430
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

43:53.840 --> 43:57.970
I wanted to go back with you.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.643
- I love you.
- No!

44:03.349 --> 44:05.602
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:05.768 --> 44:08.487
Relax, you're okay.

44:09.272 --> 44:12.947
Easy, Cis, settle down. He was
just part of the training program.

44:13.109 --> 44:16.079
He's just a simulation.
It's over.

44:16.237 --> 44:20.583
It was a test. Judgment. Concentration.
Technique.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.494
High scores on everything.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.997
Now, get some rest.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.799
You Okay?

44:37.300 --> 44:40.019
I feel a lot better now.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.896
Except for that last part...

44:50.062 --> 44:52.656
I'd say she passed.

45:18.925 --> 45:22.805
<i>Only the most exceptional people
become aware of the Matrix.</i>

45:23.721 --> 45:25.473
<i>Those that learn it exists...</i>

45:25.640 --> 45:32.273
<i>must possess a rare degree of intuition,
sensitivity and a questioning nature.</i>

45:34.982 --> 45:38.953
Signal is stable. This frequency
will continue to remain open.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.661
<i>However, very rarely...</i>

45:46.827 --> 45:51.253
<i>some gain this wisdom through
wholly different means.</i>

45:51.999 --> 45:55.378
<i>This man is one of those few.</i>

45:56.379 --> 45:59.178
Gentlemen, please
take your marks!

46:12.520 --> 46:16.366
Of course I believe you, Dan. It's
got to be some kind of mix-up.

46:16.524 --> 46:18.993
You'll clear it up, and if
you can't, you'll go on.

46:19.151 --> 46:22.325
Just like you've always done.
You know that.

46:22.905 --> 46:26.375
I don't know, Dad. I don't know
what to believe in anymore.

46:26.534 --> 46:29.378
Well, nothing worth
doing in life is easy.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.507
And I have great faith in you, son.
I know you can do it.

46:32.665 --> 46:34.167
<i>Thanks, Dad.</i>

46:57.898 --> 47:00.902
This is no good, Dan! Your
muscles are about to burst!

47:01.068 --> 47:04.242
Listen to me, there are 5000 different
reasons why you shouldn't--

47:04.405 --> 47:06.282
I know, but I'm not
withdrawing, Tom.

47:06.449 --> 47:09.749
Does the concept "first in
qualifying" mean anything to you?

47:09.910 --> 47:12.288
That's enough already!
You hear me?

47:12.455 --> 47:15.800
This is all we've worked for!
Injure yourself now and it's over!

47:15.958 --> 47:19.929
You'll lose everything! Over! And
you can kiss your career goodbye!

47:20.755 --> 47:23.429
I've made up my mind. And
I'm running tomorrow.

47:23.591 --> 47:24.763
Oh, are you?

47:24.925 --> 47:27.428
You may run, but if you
push yourself any more...

47:27.595 --> 47:30.269
you'll be lucky to
break nine minutes!

47:30.431 --> 47:33.981
I mean, why bother? It's
just not worth it, buddy.

47:34.226 --> 47:37.480
No one will ever beat my record. It's
the last chance for me to finally--

47:37.730 --> 47:39.403
What?

47:41.108 --> 47:43.110
Prove them wrong.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.575
Then do it without me.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.038
Hey, Dan, you got a second?

48:27.822 --> 48:30.792
- The clock's ticking.
- I want to ask a few questions.

48:30.950 --> 48:35.626
- You must be excited to run tomorrow.
- Always. I've never felt this good.

48:48.467 --> 48:51.721
So, what was it like breaking
9.8 in the qualifying heat?

48:51.971 --> 48:55.225
Like nothing I've felt before.
It's everything I've worked for.

48:55.474 --> 48:58.193
And now I'm just hoping I
can get back there again.

48:58.352 --> 49:01.026
Someone once said it
feels like zero gravity.

49:01.188 --> 49:04.362
You're released from the world
and you're totally free.

49:04.525 --> 49:07.028
That sounds amazing. It
must be really nice.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.367
I mean, especially
considering what happened.

49:09.530 --> 49:12.409
Well, I'll tell you, there
aren't any reporters out there.

49:12.575 --> 49:15.545
All right, Dan, I guess I'm
going to take that as my cue.

49:15.703 --> 49:18.377
But you should know even some
of us reporters are fans...

49:18.539 --> 49:21.258
so I'll just say
good luck to you.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.232
<i>American Dan Davis is down!</i>

49:55.868 --> 49:57.711
I have an unstable signal.

50:11.634 --> 50:14.808
He cannot wake up. Do
not let him wake up.

51:49.481 --> 51:54.408
<i>Dan Davis of the United States finishes
with</i> a <i>time of 8. 72 seconds...</i>

51:54.612 --> 51:56.706
<i>a new world record.</i>

52:05.164 --> 52:06.381
I'll tell you something...

52:06.540 --> 52:10.170
there's nothing quite like cherry
pie baked by my Aunt Daisy.

52:10.336 --> 52:13.556
She always bakes me one when I visit.
Look forward to it actually.

52:13.714 --> 52:17.719
It may sound like I'm bragging, but it's
really the best cherry pie in the world.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.934
She was a bit of an eccentric. She
didn't get along with my mom...

52:21.138 --> 52:24.062
but I always loved her. She
taught me so many things.

52:24.224 --> 52:26.397
We'd go to Broadway
musicals, to the movies.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.063
Now they call her the "queen
of mystery literature."

52:29.229 --> 52:31.778
Lives in an elegant villa
in the south of France.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.693
But, when I go visit, she still
bakes me her cherry pie.

52:34.860 --> 52:39.457
Something about biting into it, just for
that brief moment tasting perfection.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.534
Like leaving your
body or something.

52:41.700 --> 52:44.624
Anyone can write a novel, but
no one can beat her cherry pie.

52:44.787 --> 52:48.132
An interesting case, but
nothing to be concerned about.

52:48.290 --> 52:52.545
His memory of the race was
expunged with no residual effects.

52:52.711 --> 52:56.215
He will never run again. He will
never walk again, for that matter.

52:56.382 --> 53:01.604
We'll continue monitoring him for a
while, but anticipate no problems.

53:02.763 --> 53:07.234
A record that will live on in
people's memories for years to come.

53:07.393 --> 53:10.397
What more could anyone ask for?

53:13.440 --> 53:15.238
Free...

53:15.818 --> 53:17.946
Did you say something?

53:18.112 --> 53:19.955
Sit down.

53:22.116 --> 53:24.289
Free...

53:25.411 --> 53:28.085
Sit down!

55:09.890 --> 55:13.485
Yuki! Hey, girl, time to eat.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.567
Oh, Yuki's my cat.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.783
Well, I don't understand.

55:27.950 --> 55:30.954
If you don't want to go out with
him, why did you say you would?

55:31.119 --> 55:34.214
I mean, you don't want to give
him the wrong idea, do you?

55:34.373 --> 55:36.375
Where is she?

55:37.709 --> 55:39.052
Yuki!

55:39.211 --> 55:43.261
Well, listen, you need
to make up your mind.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.471
Where is she?

55:46.677 --> 55:48.975
I'm starting to
worry about my cat.

55:49.137 --> 55:51.731
She never misses a meal.

55:55.727 --> 55:57.149
Yuki?

55:58.856 --> 56:00.824
I'm gonna have to call you back.

56:04.987 --> 56:06.910
Yuki?

56:09.366 --> 56:11.039
Yuki!

56:19.167 --> 56:22.797
We haven't seen her anywhere today, but
we'll be sure to tell you if we do.

56:22.963 --> 56:26.388
- Ice cream!
- She's wearing a bell like this one.

56:26.842 --> 56:31.018
- I don't know where your cat is.
- Me either.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.352
I know. She's at the
old haunted house.

56:33.515 --> 56:36.940
Hey, look! There's a
rainbow over there again.

56:41.315 --> 56:45.070
I don't get it. She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?

56:45.235 --> 56:47.408
You know, you're not
supposed to go in there...

56:47.571 --> 56:50.825
but we don't really care about that.
You wanna go?

56:50.991 --> 56:54.586
- Are we going?
- It's probably raining there again.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.543
Let's go!

56:58.123 --> 57:01.343
- Ow!
- Nice moves, man.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.253
Come on!

57:08.842 --> 57:13.564
- Hey, it's over here.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

57:13.722 --> 57:15.895
You sure it's okay to show her?

57:16.224 --> 57:18.397
Hello? Where are you?

57:18.769 --> 57:21.113
Guys? Where'd you go?

57:21.271 --> 57:23.114
Where'd they go?

57:24.149 --> 57:26.527
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!

57:26.693 --> 57:28.161
Settle down!

57:28.362 --> 57:29.784
Hold still!

57:31.698 --> 57:32.915
Sit! Sit!

58:20.664 --> 58:22.462
Hello?

58:23.667 --> 58:25.635
Where is everyone?

58:52.821 --> 58:54.494
Yuki?

58:54.990 --> 58:56.583
Yuki?

58:58.201 --> 59:00.203
Stupid cat.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.059
Ah!

59:22.684 --> 59:25.062
What's happening?
What's going on here?

59:27.481 --> 59:30.234
- I got it!
- Yeah!

59:31.860 --> 59:33.032
Yuki? Is that you?

59:36.448 --> 59:39.247
There you are, Yuki.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.128
Come here.

59:42.370 --> 59:46.375
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.

59:47.209 --> 59:49.337
Bet you're hungry, huh?

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:12.322
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat's okay.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.033
- Yeah, thanks.
- Ready?

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:18.247
It's those boys.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:21.661
- Ready!
- There he goes.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.622
Banzai! Yes!

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.513
May I have your
attention, please.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:39.145
- And you are the winner!
- Winner! Yeah!

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:43.557
No fair. He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding. Look!

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:47.069
I think he's right.
He hit the ground.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.823
- Hey, who told her?
- Don't look at me.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:57.613
- I don't know.
- I didn't tell her.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.165
So this house is haunted.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.854
Wow.

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:42.787
- No way. Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:43.996
Wow.

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:55.550
That, that was-- What was that?

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.516
Hi.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.647
Anybody home?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.985
Yeah, they're gonna
tear it down.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.580
Come on, come on, come on!

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.584
Hey, light as a feather.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.587
Ah.

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:35.093
- I wanna try! I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:58.233
Hey, hey! Come on. Get away from there.
Move along!

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.988
- Get out of here!
- Yuki, wait!

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:07.747
<i>Clear the</i> area. <i>Clear
the area immediately.</i>

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.544
Get out of here!

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.092
Yuki!

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.423
Where are you?

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.432
Yuki!

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.933
Yuki!

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.442
Yuki.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.531
<i>If you don't want to go out with
him, why did you say you would?</i>

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:48.701
<i>I mean, you don't wanna
give him the wrong idea.</i>

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.869
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.088
<i>Yuki!</i>

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.797
<i>You need to make up your mind.</i>

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.802
<i>Where is she?</i>

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:02.805
<i>I'm starting to worry. Yuki!</i>

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.721
Hey, you! We've got
one over here.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.601
You don't belong here.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.519
<i>Move along, folks.</i>

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:18.564
<i>Nothing to see here. Come
on, folks, out of the way.</i>

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:23.118
<i>Go about your business.</i>

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:24.987
- All right.
- Let go of me!

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:29.533
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir. The last one's over there.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:35.171
- Examine her. Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.207
- Let go!
- Hey!

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:41.220
Listen to me! There's no bugs in there!
It's just some kids!

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:45.224
Let go! Ow! Ah!

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:49.012
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:37.226
I'm going, I'll see
you guys later.

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:40.441
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.856
Work!

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.774
It's not working.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:48.286
Forget it. Come on, let's go.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:14.373
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.470
<i>You know what I mean, Dinah?</i>

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.932
<i>I used to think being a
private detective was cool.</i>

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:36.436
<i>Like Sam Spade or
Phillip Marlowe, right?</i>

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.643
<i>But there's nothing
cool left to it.</i>

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:45.904
<i>On top of that, both my fridge
and my bank account are empty.</i>

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:57.202
Wait.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.288
Okay, Dinah, let's bet.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:03.000
If it's another suspicious husband,
I'm out of this business forever.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:09.382
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.</i>

01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:13.139
And you need me to check
on your wife, right?

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.471
<i>I'm looking for</i> a
<i>computer hacker.</i>

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.978
<i>This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That's all we know.</i>

01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:22.015
Well, it looks like we're
still in business, Dinah.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.479
Fine. And who will
I be working for?

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:27.020
<i>- I can't say.
- You</i> can't <i>say.</i>

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:30.314
Call me back when you can say.
That's not the way I do business.

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.233
It was a pleasure
chatting with you.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:37.577
<i>Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.</i>

01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:47.545
<i>I didn't get a good
feeling about the case.</i>

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:51.879
<i>But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.</i>

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.885
<i>This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.</i>

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.892
<i>A real artist by
the sound of it.</i>

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:01.430
<i>The cops were always
one step behind him.</i>

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:05.768
<i>So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?</i>

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:09.779
<i>I had a few tricks up my
sleeve for getting to hackers.</i>

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:16.448
<i>While I was searching, I
found something strange.</i>

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.908
<i>Other detectives had
been on the case too.</i>

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:27.423
<i>And their investigations had all
been, shall we say, troubled.</i>

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.423
<i>One of the guys killed himself.</i>

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.917
<i>Another had disappeared.</i>

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:35.091
<i>Another went crazy.</i>

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:39.555
<i>So I paid the one who
was left a visit.</i>

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.145
<i>The crazy one.</i>

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.316
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:55.484
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:10:01.119
And who am I? Who the hell am I?

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:10.794
<i>Did I mention he was crazy?</i>

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:19.136
Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen...

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.801
<i>I started searching all the
usual hacker hangouts...</i>

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.767
for someone <i>with</i> an Alice
in Wonderland m.o.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.399
<i>Hacker bulletin boards, anonymous
mailboxes, chat rooms.</i>

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:32.608
<i>And it was in one of those that
I picked up Trinity's trail.</i>

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:41.555
<i>"Six brooks."</i>

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:45.598
<i>"I'll be there at 2005."</i>

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:53.730
Of course!

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.817
Crossing the second brook
takes her into the woods.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.778
Alice jumps the first brook...

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.739
and...

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.990
And then she boards a train.

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:14.293
Thanks.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.589
Excuse me.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:25.675
Hey!

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.635
Hey!

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.004
I knew this was
some kind of trap.

01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:59.963
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.345
You were testing me?

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:05.552
You made it. I'm impressed.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.976
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:11.979
I'm not here to flatter
you, I'm here to save you.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.164
What just happened?

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.327
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.794
Yeah, how'd you know?

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.798
You've stepped to the edge
of the looking glass.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:47.841
So then, that means
I wasn't dreaming.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:55.565
They hired me as a way of
getting to you, didn't they?

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.151
Go!

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:26.838
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.883
Now I understand what happened
to those other detectives.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.892
They went nuts.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:38.392
Well, I've gotten out of
worse jams than this.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:41.436
I am not gonna let them get you.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.276
What's happening to me?

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:55.578
I'm sorry.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.540
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.929
I wish...

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.386
I could go with you.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:14.635
I don't blame you, you know.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.976
Everything that happened,
Trinity, it was all my fault.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:24.987
<i>All that Through the
Looking Glass stuff.</i>

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:29.739
Can't get my head around it.
I'm old-fashioned.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:37.125
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:42.622
For what it's worth, I think you
could've handled the truth.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.465
It was just a job.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.925
Goodbye, Trinity.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.299
Good bye.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:35.550
<i>A case to end all cases.</i>

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:26.942
Wake up. Baby's spotted two
machines heading in fast.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:30.442
I see them.

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.733
<i>They're runners. Think
you can handle them?</i>

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.242
Watch me.

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:51.421
Hmm.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.253
Okay. I'm in.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:04.197
Hmm.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:09.161
That runner's smarter
than we've seen so far.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:11.075
- It's quite a catch.
- Thanks.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.084
Will it--? Do you
think it'll convert?

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.917
To convert is its
choice to make.

01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:19.671
Do you think we ought
to reprogram it?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.506
No. We can't make
slaves of them.

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:23.386
Because that would be simpler.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.219
We won't beat the machines
by making them our slaves.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.100
Better to let them
join us by choice.

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:31.182
Make them believe the right
choice is the one we want.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:34.940
All right. Yes, machines are tools.
They're made to be used.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.022
- It's their nature.
- To be slaves.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:40.188
That's why we can show them a
better world, why they convert.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:43.324
- But that world we show them isn't real.
- It doesn't matter.

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.861
I'm afraid they'll figure out that
we've made up the thing in our heads.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:50.869
They can't tell the difference. To an
artificial mind, all reality is virtual.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:54.668
How do they know that the real world
isn't just another simulation?

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:55.874
How do you?

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:59.882
I know I'm not dreaming now because I
know what it's like being in a dream.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:02.551
So dreaming lets you
know reality exists.

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:06.551
No. Just that my mind exists.
I don't know about the rest.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:25.483
Okay, he's good to go.
Looks like we are too.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.443
Dreaming already?

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.862
He's had a rough day.

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.496
You poor baby.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:35.493
Would you mind?

01:22:35.701 --> 01:22:37.419
Not at all.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:40.960
Ah.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:39.815
Hello there.

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:02.497
Ah.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.191
Whoo!

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:38.923
Huh? What's happening?

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:41.589
Sentinels.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.013
Ha.

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:56.975
Let's go!

01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:46.608
Come on, damn it, help me!
