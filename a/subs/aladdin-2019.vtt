That's my little
cherry on top!

49:02.437 --> 49:03.772
Okay, okay.

49:04.906 --> 49:07.910
So, what are you gonna wish?

49:08.544 --> 49:10.179
Oh, I haven't
thought about that.

49:10.312 --> 49:13.049
Mmm. You really
are not that guy.

49:13.915 --> 49:14.984
Okay.

49:15.084 --> 49:16.285
So, what would
you wish for?

49:16.385 --> 49:17.185
Mmm.

49:19.220 --> 49:22.124
No one's ever
asked me that before.

49:23.091 --> 49:24.493
It's an easy one, though.

49:25.193 --> 49:26.896
I'd wish to be free.

49:27.361 --> 49:28.964
- (CLANGING)
- To not have to say,

49:29.064 --> 49:30.198
"Poof! Can I help you?"

49:30.332 --> 49:32.034
"Poof! What would you like?"

49:32.167 --> 49:33.302
"Poof! Welcome to the lamp.

49:33.401 --> 49:34.503
"May I take your order,
please?"

49:34.970 --> 49:35.972
Freedom.

49:36.104 --> 49:37.240
I wish to be...

49:38.506 --> 49:40.041
to be human.

49:40.175 --> 49:41.910
Why don't you just
set yourself free?

49:42.010 --> 49:43.311
(LAUGHING)

49:45.080 --> 49:47.450
Carpet! Did you hear
what this boy said?

49:47.582 --> 49:49.918
Why don't I set myself free?

49:51.053 --> 49:52.355
Only way a genie
gets to be free...

49:52.486 --> 49:54.823
is if the owner of the lamp

49:54.923 --> 49:57.225
uses one of his wishes
to set him free...

49:57.359 --> 49:59.328
and the last time
that happened was, like,

49:59.428 --> 50:01.864
the fourth of Never-ary.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.537
I'll do it.
I've got three, right?

50:07.970 --> 50:09.338
Actually, you have two left.

50:09.470 --> 50:12.007
You used one to get out
of the cave. Remember?

50:12.307 --> 50:13.910
Did I? Or did you?

50:14.309 --> 50:16.412
I thought I had to be
rubbing the lamp.

50:16.511 --> 50:17.880
Okay, little street boy.

50:17.979 --> 50:20.081

50:30.191 --> 50:32.060
- I'll keep my eye on you.
- ABU: Uh-oh.

50:32.160 --> 50:34.429
At least now, I can use
my third wish to set you free.

50:36.031 --> 50:37.500
Here's the thing
about wishes...

50:38.300 --> 50:41.437
the more you have,
the more you want.

50:42.069 --> 50:43.872
That's not me.

Mmm.

50:45.374 --> 50:46.441
We'll see about that.

- But there is something.
- GENIE: Uh-oh.

50:48.510 --> 50:49.511
Seen that face before.

50:50.312 --> 50:52.381
Who is she?
Who's the girl?

50:53.281 --> 50:54.550
She's a princess.

50:54.649 --> 50:56.084
Aw, aren't they all?

50:56.218 --> 50:58.921
"Treat your woman like
a queen," I always say.

50:59.053 --> 51:01.356
No,
she's an actual princess.

51:01.490 --> 51:02.925
Well, I already told you,

51:03.024 --> 51:04.926
I can't make anyone
love anyone, so...

51:05.060 --> 51:06.963
No, no.
We had a connection.

51:07.062 --> 51:07.997
Did they?

51:09.631 --> 51:10.633
Okay.

51:11.566 --> 51:14.069
She is smart, and kind,
and so beautiful.

51:14.202 --> 51:16.372
But she has to marry a...

51:17.673 --> 51:19.040
Hey! Can you make me
a prince?

51:20.107 --> 51:23.379
There's a lot of gray area
in "make me a prince."

51:24.345 --> 51:26.648
I could just
make you a prince.

51:26.749 --> 51:27.950
Oh, no.

51:28.050 --> 51:29.017
Right. You'd be snuggled up

51:29.116 --> 51:30.526
with that dude
for the rest of your life.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.255
PRINCE:
Yo, y'all seen my palace?

51:32.354 --> 51:34.122
Be specific with your words.

51:34.589 --> 51:37.493
- The deal is in the detail.
- Got it.

51:37.593 --> 51:38.627
Which I don't
really understand

51:38.727 --> 51:39.928
because if she
already likes you...

51:40.062 --> 51:41.063
why change?

51:41.162 --> 51:43.332
I told you,
she has to marry a prince.

Keep a close eye
on Prince Ali.

01:09:20.553 --> 01:09:23.091
She just walked out.

01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:25.993
Maybe I went a tad far
with the back flip...

01:09:26.093 --> 01:09:28.595
but that dance
may be the best thing

01:09:28.694 --> 01:09:30.029
you ever do in your life!

01:09:30.564 --> 01:09:32.033
I was pretty good.

01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:34.001
But nothing seems
to impress her.

01:09:34.135 --> 01:09:38.073
Yeah, it's crazy.
Not gems or jams or jewels.

01:09:38.203 --> 01:09:41.274
If I can't impress her,
I wonder who can.

01:09:42.376 --> 01:09:43.511
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:09:43.644 --> 01:09:47.180

try being yourself.

01:09:47.314 --> 01:09:49.484
But she has to
marry a prince.

a few more minutes with her,

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.220

01:09:54.454 --> 01:09:55.522

over there.

01:09:55.655 --> 01:09:56.757
Is that an official wish?

01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:59.461
No. It's a favor.
For a friend.

really have friends.

had a friend like me.

distracting
a certain handmaiden...

Yes, well, that's what people
say about me! (CHUCKLES)

01:10:45.506 --> 01:10:48.543
Well, that didn't come out
the right way.

01:10:48.676 --> 01:10:50.645
No one says that.
I don't know why I said that.

01:10:50.744 --> 01:10:51.745

She will hate them.

01:10:56.117 --> 01:10:59.154

her heart is through her mind.

01:10:59.253 --> 01:11:02.689
Oh, actually, these are
from me to you.

01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:07.128

one moment?

01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:35.656
Right. How's this going?

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:38.860
It's clumsy,
but in a charming sort of a way.

an evening stroll?

01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:49.104

But you already
know that.

01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:23.991
When we first met,
you were disguised in your own city.

01:19:24.123 --> 01:19:25.825
You saw us arrive

01:19:25.926 --> 01:19:28.963
with dancers, an elephant,
and a magic carpet.

01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:30.998
How could a street thief
have all that?

01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:33.601
But how could I not
recognize you?

01:19:34.801 --> 01:19:36.937
People don't see the real you
when you're royalty.

01:19:39.972 --> 01:19:43.010
I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassed.

01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:45.713
I mean, you've seen
more of Agrabah in days

01:19:45.812 --> 01:19:47.847
than I have
in an entire lifetime.

01:19:51.318 --> 01:19:52.686
We should...

01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:56.957
probably head back.

01:19:58.357 --> 01:20:00.026
Already?

01:20:09.035 --> 01:20:10.870
Until tomorrow, Princess.

01:20:26.218 --> 01:20:27.253
Good night.

01:20:44.437 --> 01:20:46.774
Fascinating.

01:20:49.943 --> 01:20:51.111
Ooh.

01:20:51.212 --> 01:20:53.214
I like that face.
Good date?

01:20:53.346 --> 01:20:54.649
The best.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.883
But it was better
than the best.

01:20:57.016 --> 01:21:00.086
She figured out I was Aladdin.
You said that wouldn't happen.

01:21:00.186 --> 01:21:04.091
Wow! I mean, genie magic
is really just a facade.

01:21:04.223 --> 01:21:05.793
At some point,

01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:08.294
real character's always
gonna shine through.

01:21:08.427 --> 01:21:10.263
But that's a good thing,
right? Now, she knows.

01:21:10.864 --> 01:21:11.866
Well...

01:21:11.998 --> 01:21:13.167
Well, what?

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.301
He told me he was only

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.970
pretending to be a thief
to see the city...

01:21:16.069 --> 01:21:17.838
but he's actually
a prince.

01:21:17.937 --> 01:21:20.207
I convinced her that
I really was a prince.

01:21:20.339 --> 01:21:21.374
And you believed him?

01:21:21.507 --> 01:21:22.709
And she believed you?

01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:23.811
I think so.

01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:28.115
Eventually, you are going to
have to tell her the truth.

01:21:28.248 --> 01:21:31.218
Eventually,
I will tell her.

01:21:31.952 --> 01:21:35.455
Anyway,
I sort of am a prince now.

01:21:35.922 --> 01:21:36.991
Oh!

01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:39.727
So, you're gonna drink
from that cup.

01:21:40.827 --> 01:21:42.930
You don't think maybe
you want to believe him...

01:21:43.029 --> 01:21:44.297
because you have to
marry a prince,

01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:45.932
but you can't marry a thief?

01:21:46.065 --> 01:21:50.236
No, I believe him. I do.

All right.
But this is what you need.

01:54:36.935 --> 01:54:40.004

by royal decree.

01:54:40.137 --> 01:54:42.207

01:54:42.339 --> 01:54:44.243
"Must marry a prince."

01:54:44.374 --> 01:54:46.412
Right.
But you say the words...

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:49.782
and this law just,
kinda like, goes away.

01:54:49.913 --> 01:54:53.151
And you and the princess
are in it together forever.

01:54:53.252 --> 01:54:55.320

the law disappear?
