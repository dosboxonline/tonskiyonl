a cutaneous horn.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.399
Look it up.
It's a real thing.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.002
Madam, you're going straight
in our book.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.939
I know, it's a corny joke,
but sex sells.

19:00.941 --> 19:02.474
You'd be surprised
how many people

19:02.476 --> 19:04.309
Use this book as porn.

19:08.482 --> 19:11.349
So, have you lovebirds
been in before?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.084
Not me, but jeff's
been in a few times.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.021
What can I say?
I'm just a little cowboy.

19:16.023 --> 19:17.755
<i> My</i> little cowboy.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.292
Sorry?
Oh, just
private mutterings.

19:20.294 --> 19:22.561
[ camera shutter clicking ]

19:24.698 --> 19:26.265
[ thinking ]
<i> I'm remembering.</i>

19:28.836 --> 19:30.569
<i> Oh, no.</i>

19:32.706 --> 19:33.706
<i> Oh, god.</i>

19:35.843 --> 19:37.309
Jeff, he's the killer.

19:37.311 --> 19:38.977
He killed
all your friends.

19:38.979 --> 19:39.845
Ah, phooey.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.913
Alright,
time for more murder.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.649
Run, jeff!

19:43.651 --> 19:45.584
I don't understand
what's happening!

19:46.520 --> 19:48.186
Freeze, willie.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.456
You know my name.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.590
Oh, you don't even
have a gun.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.661
Jeff, "freeze" is what people
who have guns say.

19:55.663 --> 19:57.129
Sorry,
I'm bad at words.

19:57.131 --> 20:00.398
But I'm good at attacking you
like a meerkat.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.734
Ca-ca-caw!
Caw!

20:02.736 --> 20:05.671
Okay, here's the plan --
I shoot you in both knees,

20:05.673 --> 20:09.407
Kill your wife, and then
visit you in the hospital.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.677
We'll get through this
together, as friends.

20:11.679 --> 20:14.813
I have a few problems
with the plan.

20:14.815 --> 20:17.483
Now that my mindhunter look
is complete,

20:17.485 --> 20:21.286
Off to arrest and/or kill jeff,
that murderer.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.755
Man, I gotta feel the wind
in this baby.

20:23.757 --> 20:24.756
Aah!

20:24.758 --> 20:26.091
[ tires screech,
willie screams ]

20:26.093 --> 20:28.160
Someone stop that dog
with a wig in its mouth!

20:28.162 --> 20:29.427
It's from europe!

20:29.429 --> 20:32.331
The wig, I mean.
The dog looks local.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.567
[ police radio chatter ]

20:35.569 --> 20:38.070
[ siren wails ]
hey!

20:39.239 --> 20:42.040
So we agree --
no more space for a while?

20:42.042 --> 20:44.910
I'm gonna be right
by your side, babe.

20:44.912 --> 20:47.713
Hey, your friends
didn't ghost you after all.

20:47.715 --> 20:49.781
They were just murdered
by a maniac.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.183
Oh, yeah.

20:51.185 --> 20:53.185
It's a happy ending.

20:53.187 --> 20:55.688
[ camera shutter clicks ]

20:58.058 --> 20:59.825
Have a great night!
