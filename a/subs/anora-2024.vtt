He said I looked like
his 18-year-old daughter.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.547
And then he bought
five dances from me.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.427
That's fucking disgusting.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.429

05:35.169 --> 05:37.004
Seriously, he came out
of the bathroom one time,

05:37.129 --> 05:38.756
and he didn't zip up
his fucking pants.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.215
It's like, if you can't zip up

05:40.340 --> 05:41.884
your fucking pants
after you take a piss,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.094
I don't trust you
with the music.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.262
Dude, he's 40.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.930
He's literally geriatric.

05:47.056 --> 05:48.432
- No, I know. It's like...
-Ani.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.060
I got a kid who wants someone
who speaks Russian.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.479
You know, Jimmy, the girls
and I have been talking,

05:53.604 --> 05:57.316
and if your cousin doesn't
start showing us some respect,

05:57.441 --> 05:58.984
we're not gonna tip out
anymore.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.736
- All right. I'll talk to him.
-Yeah.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.613
Who are you talking about,
the DJ?

06:02.738 --> 06:04.907
-All right, seriously?
- He's an asshole.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.617
I shared my playlist with him,

06:06.742 --> 06:08.452
and he was very rude
and dismissive.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.745
You're killing me.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.205
Let's go. Come on.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.664
No. No, I'm eating my food.

- To keep things fresh.
-She's eating.

- Come on. What the fuck.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.672

Get a roll on it.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.549

06:24.343 --> 06:26.720
-Hey, guys.
-Then... One second, bro.

how do you know Russian?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.896

learned English, so...

07:59.021 --> 08:01.023
Ah. Uh-huh.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.399
- Yeah.
- But enough about me.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.070

uh, but he lives here.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.739

08:14.578 --> 08:16.121
I guess you can say that. Yeah.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.956
But I'm speaking, uh...

08:18.081 --> 08:20.667
May I switch to Russian?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.794
-  Yeah? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Whatever you want.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.421
Yeah, because my English
sounds terrible.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.548
-  At all, yeah.
- No, no, no.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.634
- Your English is really good.
- Yeah.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.988
ANI
Wow.

Not too shabby.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.911
What is "shabby"?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.829
Oh, I'm-I'm just playing.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.500
I meant

13:28.475 --> 13:29.851
Oh.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.270

13:34.564 --> 13:36.274
They didn't make my bed yet.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.193
Fuck. Is it so
difficult?

13:39.110 --> 13:40.362
Sorry.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.656
Whoa.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.411
Nice view.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.039
My view's better.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.420
Okay.
So, what are you looking for?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.714
Um, sex.

Yeah, I know.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.887
I mean, like, anything special?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.931
Yeah, special sex.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.601

Okay.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.355

You want to take
your clothes off?

Yeah.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.960
Wow. Okay.

Ah. Want you?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.495
Oh, uh, sure.

S-S-S-Sure.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.417
But be careful
with that shit, yeah?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.044
Careful. Ah.

Tip.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.969

15:28.094 --> 15:30.055
That's very generous of you.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.307
And I want to say
one more thing.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.391
Yes.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.393
It was really amazing.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.105
Oh, oh, oh.

I love these guys.
You know them?

No.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.696
Oh. You must know them.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.749
So, um, how old are you?

15:57.874 --> 15:59.167
Twenty-one.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.502
How old are you?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.253
Mm, older than you.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.048
How old are you?
25?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.884
No, I'm-I'm 23.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.636
Oh, wow.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.056
You act like you
are 25.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.518
Okay.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.396
You're funny.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.689
Yeah, I know.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.316
So, funny? Why?

16:24.359 --> 16:26.277

16:26.403 --> 16:27.862
You're just... you're, like...

to get all of this?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.756
What do you think I do?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.426
Well, what do you think
I think you do?

16:49.551 --> 16:53.179
Oh, fucking English.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.348
Mm. Okay. I can say,

16:55.473 --> 16:59.769
but it's, uh...
it's really big secret.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.146
Okay.

You don't want to fucking know,
Jimmy.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.213
- How are you doing?
- She wants a week off.

28:34.338 --> 28:37.716
- I thought you wanted me to tell him.
- You see the shit that I have to deal with?

28:37.842 --> 28:40.469
I just made the schedule.
Now she wants to pull this bullshit.

28:40.594 --> 28:41.679
Oh.
The schedule.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.181
- We just gave you New Year's.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Jimmy,

28:44.306 --> 28:45.724
once you give me
health insurance,

28:45.850 --> 28:48.436
workers' comp
and a fucking 401(k),

28:48.561 --> 28:50.688
then you can tell me
when I work and not work.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.482
Well, none of that's
gonna happen, so...

28:53.607 --> 28:55.443
-Shocker.
- Bye.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.284
I'll be back on Tuesday.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.452
Today is Tuesday.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.370
Correct.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.706
- That's a week.
- No shit.

29:14.044 --> 29:16.380
Thank you.

29:29.018 --> 29:30.603
-You like that?
-No.

29:36.734 --> 29:40.404
You know, Ani, it's the
champagne glass of my mother.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.114
Of my fucking mother.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.742
And it will be
your champagne glass.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.036
And what we are cheering for?

29:47.161 --> 29:49.455
About my new girlfriend.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.790

Fuck.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.116
Klara, maybe you want a hit?

30:26.450 --> 30:28.577
Sorry, Ivan. Not today.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.663
Mm-hmm.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.581
It was really
funny when, uh,

30:32.706 --> 30:34.291
Klara smoked
last time.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.585
My mother, uh, caught her
in the cryo chamber.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.212
What?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.047
Nothing, just keep working.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.758
You have a cryo
chamber?

30:42.883 --> 30:43.676
Yeah.

30:47.388 --> 30:48.931
Oh, shit.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.766
Yeah, but I'm not allowed
to drive them

30:50.891 --> 30:52.810
because my parents are dicks.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.897
- What's up?
-How are you?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.274
- I'm good.
-Yeah, what's up, man?

30:58.399 --> 30:59.441

-Welcome.

whatever the fuck these are.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.072
There's Ring Pops.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.907

Are you happy?

32:28.697 --> 32:31.450

Guys,

32:43.462 --> 32:47.758
the best ketamine I ever tried

32:47.883 --> 32:49.218
was in Vegas!

32:49.677 --> 32:52.137
Vegas.
It's a great idea.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.556
We are going to fucking Vegas.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.691
Welcome to Vegas!

33:07.152 --> 33:08.987
We're in Vegas, bitch!

33:09.113 --> 33:11.490
-Ah.
- Welcome back, Mr. Zakharov.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.575
Your suite is almost ready.

33:13.701 --> 33:14.993
We didn't know you were coming,

33:15.119 --> 33:16.620
- and the suite was occupied...
- Uh-huh.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.038
...but they're out,

33:18.163 --> 33:20.207
and housekeeping
should be done any minute.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.419
What the fuck, man?
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:23.544 --> 33:25.003
You mean I have to wait?

33:25.129 --> 33:26.964
You mean we have to wait
right now, bro, yes?

33:27.089 --> 33:27.965
Yes?

33:38.559 --> 33:40.728
Have a great time.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.314
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

33:44.440 --> 33:47.443
Yeah! Oh!

33:49.653 --> 33:50.988
Can somebody turn on music?

33:51.113 --> 33:52.614

-Turn on the music!

33:52.740 --> 33:54.491

- What...

34:53.467 --> 34:55.052
But do it with a double dose

34:55.177 --> 34:57.763
because we're gonna go

34:57.888 --> 34:59.431
Okay?

35:42.850 --> 35:44.726
Well, you know,
it could last longer

35:44.852 --> 35:48.105
and be better
if you just take it easy.

35:48.230 --> 35:49.439
Like, how?

35:49.565 --> 35:51.692

36:09.710 --> 36:11.545
I hope you had fun this week.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.380
I hope you had fun
this week.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.215
Oh, I did.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.176
You know, we should
do it again sometime.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.761
Yeah.

36:19.887 --> 36:22.014
For sure.

36:22.139 --> 36:24.433
Mm, but...

36:24.558 --> 36:28.770
I have to go back to Russia
because I promised my father

36:28.896 --> 36:31.773
that I would start working
in his fucking company.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.775
Oh.

36:33.901 --> 36:37.112
Okay, so that's why
you've been splashing out, hmm?

36:37.237 --> 36:39.489
Eh, no, I am always
partying like this.

36:39.615 --> 36:40.699
Mm.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.451
I love it.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.292
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.379
-  What?
- What?

36:54.504 --> 36:56.757
Does that, like, sound weird?

36:56.882 --> 36:58.175
No, no.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.802
And will you miss me
or my money blyat?

37:00.928 --> 37:03.096
Or your money blyat.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.058
- Of course.
- Yeah, I like it.

37:06.183 --> 37:09.853
But, mm, if I get married
to an American,

37:09.978 --> 37:12.022
I wouldn't have to go back
to Russia.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.776
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.361
Okay.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.987
So, who would you marry?

37:19.112 --> 37:20.697
I don't know.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.075
Maybe Crystal.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.160
Or your friend Lulu.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.329
She's so hot.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.958
You.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.834
"You."

37:33.752 --> 37:35.462
It's Vegas.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.713
It's fucking Vegas.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.256
Don't people get married
in Vegas?

37:38.382 --> 37:40.592
Mm... Don't fuck around.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.887
I am not fucking around.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.640
Okay.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.518
Okay, go.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.478
- Go get married.
- Yes.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.313
Yes, let's get married.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.815
Fuck. You asshole.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.483
- Why?
- Don't.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.403
Like, don't fucking tease me
with that shit, okay?

37:59.528 --> 38:01.113
- Stop.
- It ain't cool.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.615
Stop, stop, stop.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.659
- Ani.
- Yeah?

38:05.784 --> 38:08.745
Will you marry me?

38:10.747 --> 38:13.083
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.127
Mm-hmm.

38:15.252 --> 38:18.005
So you want to get married
to me, Vanya?

38:18.130 --> 38:20.257
You want me to be
your little wifey?

38:20.382 --> 38:21.800
Yeah?

38:21.925 --> 38:23.510
Yes.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.222
I just think that we had
great time together, and, uh...

38:27.347 --> 38:30.183
Shit, I'm nervous.
I'll say it in Russian.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.103
I think
we would have a great time

38:33.228 --> 38:35.480
even if I didn't have money.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.941
And I will become
American,

38:38.066 --> 38:40.819
and my parents
will suck my dick.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.076
Are you serious?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.247
I am serious.

and I think we should do it

because that's been,
like, my dream

the Disney Princess theme?

TOROS
Garnik. Garnik.

43:21.391 --> 43:22.475
Now?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.977
- Yes.
- Now?

43:34.612 --> 43:39.117
Take this. Grab
the Russian and get over there.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.870
What did he do now?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.463
Die, die, die.

43:51.588 --> 43:53.131
Yeah.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.218
Come on.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.888
Just answer it or
shut it off.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.779
- Vanya.
- Hmm?

44:17.655 --> 44:18.782
What did, uh...

44:18.907 --> 44:21.451
what did they say when you told
them?

44:21.576 --> 44:25.872
I don't want really
talk about them.

44:28.917 --> 44:31.336
Well, you did tell them, right?

44:31.461 --> 44:34.005
Mm. Sure.

44:37.759 --> 44:39.636
I mean...

44:39.761 --> 44:42.389
This is good news, right?

44:43.681 --> 44:47.769
Parents usually want
their kids to get married.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.271
Yeah,

44:50.397 --> 44:52.816
but my parents are dicks,
you know.

44:53.274 --> 44:56.277
Uh, whatever. Mm.

44:58.238 --> 45:00.281
No matter what,

45:00.407 --> 45:03.451
I hope they like me...

45:03.576 --> 45:05.245
You know...

45:05.703 --> 45:08.748
when we meet.

45:11.501 --> 45:13.002
By the way,

45:13.128 --> 45:16.423
when will we meet your parents?

45:16.548 --> 45:18.591
Mm...

45:21.928 --> 45:25.348
Well, if you want
to go to Miami...

45:26.141 --> 45:29.644
My mom lives there with her man.

45:30.311 --> 45:34.816
And you can meet
my sister anytime.

45:35.817 --> 45:40.321
Although I'm sure
she'll try to steal you.

45:40.447 --> 45:43.116
She loves Russian guys.

45:46.161 --> 45:49.247
What?
Are you making fun of me?

45:49.372 --> 45:51.166
I'm trying here, asshole.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.126
No, your Russian
is wonderful! Really.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.752
Every single day
you're doing better and better.

45:54.878 --> 45:57.338
You're almost like
a native speaker.

45:57.464 --> 45:59.466
Oh, okay.

45:59.591 --> 46:00.717
- You're a liar.
- No, no, no.

46:00.842 --> 46:02.135
Not now. Ani, not now.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.888
I'm playing.
I have a mission.

46:05.013 --> 46:07.307
Give me the controller.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.808
I lost!

46:11.686 --> 46:13.980
-  Okay.
- Okay.

46:15.148 --> 46:16.774
"Arguments and
Facts"

46:16.900 --> 46:19.152
ran a photo of him with
some chick

46:19.277 --> 46:21.279
at an NBA game.

46:22.155 --> 46:25.366
And they are saying
she's a prostitute.

46:29.662 --> 46:31.289
It's not funny, man.

46:31.414 --> 46:32.957
Don't you dare laugh.

46:33.082 --> 46:36.711
If it's true,
Toros and I are fucked.

46:37.170 --> 46:41.633
Well, Toros would be fucked
more than me, but still.

46:41.758 --> 46:43.927
Sounds like tabloid bullshit.

46:44.052 --> 46:45.678
Probably.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.848
But listen, if things get crazy,

46:48.973 --> 46:50.850
don't get rough with Ivan.

46:50.975 --> 46:54.062
Actually, don't even touch Ivan,
let me deal with him.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.523
I got you. But what
do you need me for then?

46:56.648 --> 46:59.067
In case his boys are there

46:59.192 --> 47:01.486
and they want to play games.

47:01.986 --> 47:05.240
Hey. Is Ivan at
the house?

47:05.365 --> 47:06.616
I don't know.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.034
He hasn't left
since I've been here,

47:08.159 --> 47:10.453
but I just started my shift.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.039
Do you know if he got married?

47:13.164 --> 47:14.791
Married?

47:14.916 --> 47:17.168
I have no idea.
I just got here.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.337
Okay, open the gate.

47:21.047 --> 47:23.800
Drive in
and park on the right side.

47:28.263 --> 47:29.597
Right here.

47:52.161 --> 47:54.831
-  Expecting guests?
- No way.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.049
Oh.

48:05.592 --> 48:07.260
Yo, what do you
want?

48:07.385 --> 48:08.970
Ivan, it's Garnik.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.972
I know. What do you want?

48:11.097 --> 48:13.308
Ivan, open the door, please.

48:13.433 --> 48:16.811
- I'm busy. No.
- We have to talk.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.896
Why do I always have
to repeat myself with you?

48:19.022 --> 48:21.107
I'm busy, I have guests.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.692
Ivan, it's important.
We have to talk.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.903
No, we're done.
Get the fuck out of here.

48:26.446 --> 48:27.655
ANI
Who was that?

48:27.780 --> 48:29.073
They're my father's monkeys.

48:29.616 --> 48:31.409
Son of a bitch.

48:33.745 --> 48:34.996
What the
fuck?

48:35.121 --> 48:36.456
Are you fucking
kidding me?

48:36.581 --> 48:37.874
What the fuck are
you doing?

48:37.999 --> 48:39.667
You think you can enter
my house like this?

48:39.792 --> 48:42.420
-  Vanya, what the fuck?
-  Slow down, you'll break my leg.

48:42.545 --> 48:43.504
I don't give a fuck.

48:43.630 --> 48:45.590
-  Vanya, should I call 911?
- It's okay. It's okay.

48:45.715 --> 48:47.925
Ivan, your father
sent us.

48:48.051 --> 48:49.802
Right, my father sent you.
Are you kidding me?

48:49.927 --> 48:53.973
Well, not us. Your father sent
Toros and Toros sent us.

48:54.098 --> 48:56.100
So, where's Toros?

48:56.476 --> 48:57.852
He's busy.

48:57.977 --> 49:01.064
But he will be very upset
with you if this is true.

49:01.189 --> 49:02.231
If what is true?

49:02.357 --> 49:03.358
That you got married

49:03.483 --> 49:04.484
to some prostitute.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.319
What?

49:07.612 --> 49:08.988
Is that her?

49:09.113 --> 49:11.240
- Are you married to her?
- Yes!

49:11.366 --> 49:12.909
Did you lose your fucking mind?

49:13.034 --> 49:15.286
Yes, we married
and we're doing fucking great!

49:15.411 --> 49:16.663
With a signature and paperwork?

49:16.788 --> 49:20.291
Yes. Now get the fuck out
of my house.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.794
You're in big trouble, brother!

49:22.919 --> 49:25.797
You'll be in trouble if
you don't move your fucking leg.

49:25.922 --> 49:28.049
Vanya, what the
fuck is going on?

49:28.424 --> 49:30.593
We'll wait, I need
to see the marriage license.

49:30.718 --> 49:32.261
Fuck. Are you serious?

49:32.387 --> 49:35.890
Bro, the faster we do it,
the faster we're out of here.

49:36.015 --> 49:38.184
My parents are fucking crazy!

49:38.309 --> 49:39.811
Okay.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.979
If my parents need
proof, I'll give them proof.

49:42.105 --> 49:43.773
Uh, where
is the marriage paper?

49:43.898 --> 49:45.149
- Uh, marriage...
-The marriage license?

49:45.274 --> 49:46.401
-License, yeah.
-It's, um...

49:46.526 --> 49:48.027
It's in the desk
in the office. Why?

49:48.152 --> 49:49.570
- Okay. Uh...
- Should I go with you?

49:49.696 --> 49:51.280
Uh, no, no, no. Stay here.

49:51.406 --> 49:52.699
Wait here.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.884
Hi.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.817
Here.
Choke on it, dude.

50:42.665 --> 50:44.083
I'm Igor.

50:45.877 --> 50:46.919
You?

50:49.255 --> 50:51.299
Ani.

50:51.424 --> 50:53.384
I'm Vanya's wife.

50:57.597 --> 50:59.390
Congratulations.

51:02.477 --> 51:03.728
What are you
doing?

51:04.312 --> 51:08.691
I've been asked to take a photo
of the license... if it exists.

51:08.816 --> 51:09.942
That's insane.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.694
My parents asked for that?

51:11.819 --> 51:12.987
Toros.

51:13.112 --> 51:14.947
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:37.345 --> 51:39.096
No.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.769
What the fuck is going on here?

51:50.399 --> 51:52.276
I have no idea.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.241
It's over, go, go,
go, go...

51:58.366 --> 51:59.575
Wait.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.035
Wait.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.870
-  Is everything okay?
-  Yeah, it's okay.

52:02.995 --> 52:04.413
Yeah? What the fuck
is going on?

52:04.539 --> 52:06.249
Yeah, just time
to say goodbye to guys.

52:06.374 --> 52:08.793
Me and my wife
need some privacy.

52:08.918 --> 52:11.003
You look tired, Garnik, go home.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.422
We need to wait to see
what Toros says.

52:13.548 --> 52:16.592
I'm waiting for you
and your fucking Armenian ass

52:16.717 --> 52:18.010
to be out of my house.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.522
Sorry.

52:31.774 --> 52:33.442
So sorry.

52:33.568 --> 52:35.653
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

52:36.696 --> 52:39.282
I'm waiting for
you to be on your fucking way.

52:39.407 --> 52:40.449
Bye, bro!

52:40.575 --> 52:42.368
Ivan...

52:42.743 --> 52:44.245
It's Toros.

52:45.079 --> 52:46.330
"Stand by."

52:46.455 --> 52:48.332
..."Stand by"?

52:48.457 --> 52:51.043
He texted, "Stand by,"
so we stand by.

52:51.168 --> 52:54.130
- So stand by outside my mansion, motherfuckers.
-Yeah.

52:54.255 --> 52:55.298
What's the problem?

52:55.423 --> 52:56.841
So apparently, it is true.

52:58.968 --> 53:03.139
Yes.
I've seen the marriage license.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.603
Galina Stepanovna,
please don't worry.

53:08.728 --> 53:11.480
Ivan, with all due respect...

53:11.606 --> 53:13.608
your father sent us.

53:13.733 --> 53:15.651
Fucking Toros sent you!

53:15.776 --> 53:18.988
Toros works for me! I pay him!

53:19.113 --> 53:22.867
And you bring some fucking
gopnik into my home.

53:22.992 --> 53:25.661
I promise,
I will fix everything.

53:29.749 --> 53:32.501
Galina Stepanovna.
Yes, Galina Stepanovna.

53:32.627 --> 53:36.380
I'm having your ass fired!
You're dead for this!

53:36.505 --> 53:37.882
Bitch!

53:38.007 --> 53:40.927
Okay, look, look.
You work for Ivan's family,

53:41.052 --> 53:43.846
so I'm assuming that means
you work for him, right?

53:43.971 --> 53:46.140
So if he's telling you
to take it outside,

53:46.265 --> 53:47.558
fucking take it outside.

53:47.683 --> 53:49.393
Fucking take it outside!
Listen to my wife.

53:49.518 --> 53:50.853
Real talk!

53:57.860 --> 53:59.403
- Are you kidding me?
- Everybody, so sorry.

53:59.528 --> 54:00.905
I have to go.

54:01.030 --> 54:03.532
I have an emergency.
Sorry about that.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.664
He says we have
to stay here.

54:09.789 --> 54:11.248
Move, move...

54:11.374 --> 54:12.792
Move. Thank you.

54:12.917 --> 54:15.878
- Wait.
- It's Toros.

54:16.003 --> 54:19.006
-Hello, Toros.
- Put me on the fucking speaker

54:19.131 --> 54:20.633
so this hooker
can hear me, too.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.177
He just called me a hooker?

54:23.302 --> 54:25.054
You're already on
speaker.

54:25.179 --> 54:28.057
She's fucking
erotic dancer. Hi, Toros.

54:28.182 --> 54:30.017
What did you do, Ivan?

54:30.142 --> 54:31.310
What did you do?

54:31.686 --> 54:33.688
I don't check in
on you

54:33.813 --> 54:35.022
for two weeks

54:35.147 --> 54:36.983
and you go
and marry a prostitute!

54:37.108 --> 54:38.484
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

54:38.609 --> 54:40.152
I'm not a fucking
prostitute,

54:40.277 --> 54:41.195
you fucking piece of
shit.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.488
Yeah, fucking Armenian
piece of shit.

54:42.613 --> 54:44.699
You Armenian piece of shit!

54:44.824 --> 54:46.117
<i> Do you understand</i>

54:46.242 --> 54:47.618
how shameful this is?

54:48.869 --> 54:51.664
-Toros.
<i>- Your mother was crying, do you hear me?</i>

54:51.789 --> 54:53.499
Toros!

54:53.624 --> 54:55.418
Your mother,
she never cry in her life.

54:55.543 --> 54:56.711
She was crying on the phone.

54:56.836 --> 54:58.212
-Toros!
- Shame on you!

54:58.337 --> 55:00.047
- Fuck you! Blyat!
-Ivan.

55:00.172 --> 55:01.674
Fucking faggot.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.175
And guess what?

55:03.300 --> 55:05.094
Guess what, you little shit!

55:05.219 --> 55:06.762
And what? Surprise me!

55:06.887 --> 55:09.181
<i>You really did it this time.</i>

55:09.306 --> 55:10.182
What?

55:10.641 --> 55:12.393
Your parents are on their way!

55:12.518 --> 55:13.644
Your parents are on the way.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.229
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

55:15.354 --> 55:16.230
To where?

55:16.355 --> 55:18.816
<i>Here. Where else? Here!</i>

55:19.525 --> 55:22.862
<i>Coming to pick you up
like a naughty school boy,</i>

55:22.987 --> 55:24.363
<i>you hear me?</i>

55:24.488 --> 55:26.407
<i>We're meeting them
tomorrow at noon.</i>

55:26.532 --> 55:28.409
Vanya,
what the fuck is going on?

55:28.534 --> 55:30.619
<i> They're taking
you back to Russia,</i>

55:30.745 --> 55:32.288
<i>so start packing.</i>

55:32.413 --> 55:34.457
Ivan, what
the fuck? What does that mean?

55:34.582 --> 55:36.292
Do you understand?

55:37.334 --> 55:39.003
Game over for you. That's it.

55:39.128 --> 55:40.838
Vanya, we are married.

55:40.963 --> 55:42.423
They're gonna
have to accept that.

55:42.548 --> 55:44.091
- Yeah, I know!
- Yes.

55:44.216 --> 55:46.302
Accept that?

55:46.427 --> 55:48.679
That's funny. Sure, yeah.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.515
Ivan, listen to me
carefully.

55:51.932 --> 55:54.560
I'll be there in ten minutes.

55:54.685 --> 55:57.938
<i>You and your whore
are coming with me.</i>

55:58.064 --> 55:59.523
Whore?

55:59.940 --> 56:01.817
Your mother is a
fucking...

56:01.942 --> 56:04.320
- Who the fuck is this guy?
-Hey! I'm gonna be there

56:04.445 --> 56:05.905
in ten minutes, you hear me?

56:06.030 --> 56:08.365
In ten minutes, both of you
are coming with me

56:08.491 --> 56:09.992
down to the city hall.

56:10.117 --> 56:11.660
We're gonna annul
this marriage.

56:11.786 --> 56:14.288
Do you hear me? This marriage
is gonna be annulled!

56:14.413 --> 56:17.583
Oh, I am not going
fucking anywhere.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.461
We are not getting a divorce
because you tell us to!

56:20.586 --> 56:22.004
Go fuck yourself!

56:22.129 --> 56:24.173
You go fuck yourself.
How about that?

56:24.298 --> 56:26.050
Me go fuck myself?
Me fuck myself?

56:26.175 --> 56:28.636
You go fuck yourself and your
fucking mother, motherfucker!

56:28.761 --> 56:30.429
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

56:30.554 --> 56:32.223
You don't even know
who the fuck I am.

56:32.348 --> 56:34.642
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Toros, Toros, uh...

56:34.767 --> 56:35.851
You said my
parents

56:35.976 --> 56:38.229
are on their way to
America?

56:38.354 --> 56:40.773
TOROS
Yes, yes. Are you deaf?

56:40.898 --> 56:42.900
They are leaving Russia
in an hour.

56:43.025 --> 56:45.069
Tomorrow, noon, we're gonna
go meet them, you hear me?

56:45.194 --> 56:46.737
- What the fuck is going on?
- Come on.

56:46.862 --> 56:48.405
- Come on?
- Come on, come on, come on.

56:48.531 --> 56:50.074
Why do we have to leave
the house?

56:50.199 --> 56:51.951
They can't just fucking
come in here like that.

56:52.076 --> 56:55.371
- Excuse me. Get the fuck away from me, please.
-  Toros will be here in ten minutes.

56:55.496 --> 56:57.998
Garnik,
shut that bitch up, please.

56:58.124 --> 56:59.583
- Where are we going, Ivan?
- Ivan, Ivan...

56:59.708 --> 57:01.752
I don't know where
are we going, but we are going.

57:01.877 --> 57:03.129
Where is he going?

57:03.254 --> 57:05.297
Why do we have to leave,
and why are they staying?

57:05.422 --> 57:07.049
- Ivan...
- That doesn't make any sense.

57:07.174 --> 57:09.593
- Ivan, where are you going?
- We should call the fucking police or something.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.345
In ten minutes,
Toros will be here...

57:11.470 --> 57:12.388
- Vanya.
-Garnik!

57:12.513 --> 57:13.722
Did he say he's leaving?

57:13.848 --> 57:15.516
-Ivan! We...
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

57:15.641 --> 57:17.268
Okay! I need to get dressed, though!

57:17.393 --> 57:19.353
No, no. Let's do
this, let's wait for Toros.

57:19.478 --> 57:21.063
My fucking clothes
are upstairs. Fuck!

57:21.188 --> 57:23.190
- Garnik, get him. Garnik, don't let him leave.
- Where the fuck...

57:23.315 --> 57:25.151
- Vanya, wait.
-  Toros will arrive in ten minutes.

57:25.276 --> 57:26.318
Give me one fucking minute.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.737
Stop, stop. Where are you going?
No. We have no time.

57:28.863 --> 57:31.115
- I have to get dressed, Ivan.
- I have no fucking pants on.

57:31.240 --> 57:32.283
- Oh, God.
- Okay, bye.

57:32.408 --> 57:34.076
Did he say bye?

57:34.201 --> 57:35.870
What the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me?

57:35.995 --> 57:38.038
Did he say bye?
Keep her here. Ivan!

57:38.164 --> 57:39.248
Oh, my fucking God!

57:39.373 --> 57:40.791
-Garnik!
- Ivan, what the fuck?!

57:40.916 --> 57:42.585
Whoa. Uh...

57:42.710 --> 57:44.253
Get the fuck out of my way.

57:45.588 --> 57:47.798
Ivan!

57:47.923 --> 57:50.050
Get the fuck out of
my fucking way, motherfucker.

57:50.176 --> 57:51.969
- But you...
- Do not fucking touch me!

57:52.094 --> 57:53.512
No. No, no, no.

57:53.637 --> 57:54.680
Stop!

57:55.097 --> 57:57.892
Ivan! Ivan!

57:58.017 --> 57:59.435
...fucking touch
me!

57:59.560 --> 58:01.604
- Relax. Relax. It's okay.
- You fucking relax.

58:01.729 --> 58:04.440
What is happening?
Somebody talk to me, please!

58:04.565 --> 58:05.649
Don't you touch me,
motherfucker!

58:05.774 --> 58:06.609
No, just...

58:06.734 --> 58:08.277
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

58:08.402 --> 58:09.528
- Relax. Whoa.
- Motherfucker!

58:09.653 --> 58:10.738
Everything all right?

58:10.863 --> 58:11.906
What?

58:12.406 --> 58:13.991
Fucking
impressive.

58:15.201 --> 58:16.493
-  Okay...
- Stay the fuck back!

58:16.619 --> 58:18.454
No, no. What?
No, no, no, no, no!

58:18.579 --> 58:20.247
Put it. It's-it's bad way.

58:20.372 --> 58:21.832
- Wha... Just sit.
- I fucking dare you.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.375
Take another fucking step, motherfucker.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.294
No. Just... I don't...
I don't touch you.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.171
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't leave.

58:27.296 --> 58:28.422
It's okay.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.132
Uh, just put it... Whoa!

58:30.257 --> 58:32.092
Stop.

58:33.010 --> 58:35.512
Please stop.

58:35.638 --> 58:38.015
Stop, please.

58:38.140 --> 58:39.975
No, no. Stop.

58:42.728 --> 58:45.606
Stop. Stop, please.

58:45.731 --> 58:47.274
Garnik, what are you doing?

58:47.399 --> 58:49.318
Are you killing her?

58:49.443 --> 58:50.611
-Stop it!
-Fuck!

58:50.736 --> 58:52.404
Ivan throwing another one
of his tantrums, huh?

58:53.864 --> 58:56.408
Hold on. It's okay.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.287
If you don't
stop...

59:00.412 --> 59:01.747
I will tie you up!

59:02.498 --> 59:04.708
You're not tying
me up, motherfucker!

59:11.257 --> 59:14.051
Get the fuck off me!

59:17.388 --> 59:20.516
You are fucking insane.

59:21.517 --> 59:24.019
Hey. Hey!

59:24.144 --> 59:26.188
Help me! He's attacking me.

59:26.313 --> 59:28.107
What the fuck
are you doing to her, bro?

59:28.232 --> 59:30.484
Get the fuck off me!
Somebody help! Get him off me!

59:30.609 --> 59:33.070
What do you mean?
You wanted me to keep her here

59:33.195 --> 59:34.113
so I'm keeping her here.

59:34.238 --> 59:35.114
Yes, but why

59:35.239 --> 59:36.282
are you tying her up?

59:36.407 --> 59:38.284
But she got fucking crazy,

59:38.409 --> 59:39.702
started jumping all around.

59:39.827 --> 59:42.079
-  Help me!
-  What else could I do?

59:42.204 --> 59:43.956
Why are you just
fucking standing there?

59:44.081 --> 59:46.041
Igor, what the
fuck are you doing, man?

59:46.834 --> 59:49.003
She threw the candlestick at me.

59:49.128 --> 59:50.504
Let's tie her legs.

59:50.629 --> 59:53.924
No, no, no, no!
Please, please, please, please don't.

59:54.049 --> 59:56.135
We are not doing
that, let her go!

59:56.260 --> 59:59.972
Let me go, you fucking asshole.
Goddamn fucking bastard.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.391
She will run, bro.
I promise.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:04.685
Where will she run?

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.895
We're two grown men here.
Are you out of your mind?

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.694
IGOR
Okay.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:23.162
- You crazy motherfucker!
-Hey.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.997
You better stay the fuck
away from me!

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.333
Stop, stop. Listen.
You are not going anywhere.

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:29.126
Come back. Please come...

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.669
She will run
away!

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.628
Really?

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:33.005
Hey, stop.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.548
Get her!

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:39.470
Get the fuck off
me!

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:45.225
Put me down, motherfucker!

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.270
Fuck!

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:58.030
- What the fuck, man!
- She's biting, man.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.365
ANI
Fucker!

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:01.075
C'mon, tie her
legs.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.493
What? How?

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.203
You motherfucker! Fuck!

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.996
-  What do you mean how?
- Somehow, dude!

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.332
Fucking motherfucker.
You fucking asshole.

01:01:08.457 --> 01:01:09.708
With fucking what?

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.752
- Use anything!
-  No, no. Don't, don't.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.962
-  That cord!
-  No, no, don't. I don't...

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:15.881
I don't even know
what is going on here.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.425
I didn't do anything. Don't tie me.
I'm not gonna run. I promise.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:21.220
I'm calm. I'm not gonna do anything.
I'm not gonna run away.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:23.931
-  What?
-  You do not need to tie me.

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.724
Are you fucking
kidding, tie her!

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.143
No, you-you motherfucker.
You don't need to tie me.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.229
- Calm down. Listen, listen.
- I am calm. I am calm.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:32.898
Ivan's father wants this marriage annulled.
You're staying here and getting this annulled.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.066
You heard my boss.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.653
Fuck your boss.

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:40.030
I swear to fucking
God!

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.950
Garnik, you stupid fucking idiot!

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:45.077
Oh fuck.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.789
I just
want to know what is going on.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.291
Someone fucking tell me
what's going on.

01:01:51.417 --> 01:01:53.252
I'm not gonna run. Let me go.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:55.045
Damn, it's broken.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.589
I think she broke my nose.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.134
Yeah. I'm glad I
broke your fucking nose!

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:02.511
You fucking bitch,
you broke my nose!

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:04.471
Yeah? Next time, I'll kick you
in the fucking balls!

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.265
- God, let me go!
-  Hold her.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.392
Garnik,
you fucking idiot, talk to me!

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:10.310
-Fucking untie me, motherfucker!
-Hello? Garnik?

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.062
Hold on a minute,
Toros. Hold on.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.856
You fucking
piece of shit.

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:15.023
<i> Hold on?</i>

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.692
Fucking
psycho. Fucking untie me.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:18.610
C'mon man, hold
on! Fuck.

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.363
I am not fighting.
<i> Garnik, I swear, if you fucked</i>

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.573
<i>this up. Garnik! Motherfucker...</i>

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.702
Untie me. I am not fighting.
I'm not gonna run. Just fucking untie me.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.749
No.

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.084
Don't let her go.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.419
<i> I swear...</i>

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:38.088
Oh, you are so
fucked.

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:39.756
You're going to prison.

01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:41.383
Where's your ice?

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:43.677
I can't wait until Ivan sees
what you did to me.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.971
Rich people don't have ice?

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:50.517
Ivan did just leave the house.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:52.019
He did not leave.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:54.271
He is going to get help.

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.524
I-I don't think so.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.777
Garnik!

01:03:00.903 --> 01:03:02.446
You fucking asshole.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.406
Yeah, I bet you like this, huh?

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.867
Yeah, you like this,
you sick fuck?

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.827
I bet you get off on this.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.746
Fucking psycho.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:13.248
Tor, where are you?

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.042
<i> Here, you donkey
fucker.</i>

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.460
Open the gate.

01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:17.836
Okay, sir, but Ivan just...

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.171
Open the fucking gate!

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.508
I am not fighting. Let me go.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.176
No.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.970
You are not going anywhere.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:29.056
Don't let her go
under any circumstances.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:31.433
You two are
fucking dead for this!

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.852
I am Ivan's fucking wife!

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.400
Vanya?

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:50.786
Oh, are you the Armenian
fuck I was talking to?

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.121
What the fuck is happening?

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:54.998
Is this the big fucking boss?

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:56.750
-What happened here?
-  She happened.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:57.918
Hey, mister.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.711
Can you fucking tell this guy
to untie me?

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.380
-What?
-Yeah, she did this.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:02.631
- Hello.
-Where is Ivan?

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:03.966
Ivan run away.

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:06.718
- Why the fuck is no one an...
-Run away?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.303
- Excuse me, sir. Hello.
- You didn't stop him?

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.847
I-I tried, but then, uh, there was, uh, ice on
the floor.

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:12.641
- I tried to stop him.
-Hello!

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:13.725
- You tried?
-  Hello!

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.894
- Somebody fucking listen to me.
- You tried? You don't try.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.980
You just grab the guy.
What do you mean you tried?

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:20.065
- What do you mean? I'm not a...
- So he's gone?

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.692
I'm not allowed to touch
that motherfucker.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:23.110
- Excuse me! Hello!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:25.988
No, you fucking let me go.
Tell this guy to fucking let me go.

01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:28.282
What were you
doing? Why did you let him leave?

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.450
Are you the boss?
You're the fucking boss?

01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:32.536
What? He told me not to touch
the guy

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:36.164
-  Tell him to fucking let me go.
-  and I was dealing with her.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.417
Fucking... Excuse me.
Fucking motherfuckers.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.294
- Please leave your message...
- He doesn't answer.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:42.921
-  He doesn't pick up.
-Hey, fuck face.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.756
Of course
he's not going to answer.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.050
Can you tell this
motherfucker to let me go?

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.386
Why is she on top of you, man?
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:52.347
I don't know what's going on.
Can you please tell him to untie me?

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.058
-  Why is she sitting on you?
- I'm holding her!

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:56.560
TOROS
Put-put her down, please.

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:58.478
-No, don't do that.
- Yes, fucking put me down.

01:04:58.604 --> 01:04:59.605
No, don't do that.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.440
Tell him to fucking
put me down, please.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.399
Put her down.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.984
- Why you holding her like that?
-Ow.

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:05.777
- No, no, no. Be careful, bro.
-Fuck. Fuck!

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.195
-Be careful.
-Why...

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.364
Hey, now can you tell him
to fucking untie me?

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.325
Why did you... Why...
Why did you tie her hands?

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:12.492
-Untie me.
- Look.

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:15.662
-What, you afraid of this little girl?
-Can you tell him to fucking untie me?

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.165
-She's an animal.
-She's a fucking little girl! So, she...

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.167
- She beat you both up?
- She's not fighting like one.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:22.336
-I'm gonna get my phone.
-Can you untie her?

01:05:22.461 --> 01:05:25.422
- If you untie her, I'm just leaving, bro.
- This is ridiculous, man. Untie her.

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.424
- It's embarrassing.
- She will start swinging again. Don't do that.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.926
I can untie her
but you won't get what you need

01:05:30.052 --> 01:05:32.095
because she's out of control. -ANI
Fuck you.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.306
-She's an animal, bro. Trust me.
-No, these guys

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.058
are fucking liars.
-Okay, listen to me.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:38.143
Where is your phone? Can you
please give me your phone?

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:42.439
My phone is in the other room. I will go get my
phone if you untie me. I need you to untie me.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:45.317
Where? Which other room? Over there? Can-can
you... (in Russian): Go grab her phone, please.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.528
No, I will get my phone.
I'll get my phone, and I'll call Vanya.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:51.323
- I will untie you. Give me a minute.
-No! No, don't do that!

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.534
I just need your phone to call Ivan.
I know, and I will get my phone.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.495
I'm telling you to get the fucking
phone!

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.288
Let's just calm down for one second.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:00.582
-Careful.
-Calm down for a second. Just calm down.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.627
- I am calm. I'm not fucking moving.
- And listen to me. Okay, look, we have

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:04.920
an emergency here.
It's very important.

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:07.923
Okay, I need you to cooperate.
I'm begging you.

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.549
Your guys came in here.

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:11.510
They chased Ivan out
of the fucking house.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.553
They fucking tied me.
They attacked me.

01:06:13.679 --> 01:06:16.306
That motherfucker was making me
sit on his fucking lap.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:17.933
Your guys are fucking crazy.

01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:21.186
I-I'm terribly sorry
it went down that way, okay?

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:23.271
I'm terribly sorry.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.441
But now we have to just
call him, okay?

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.527
Here. Help me, please.

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.071
He's-he's on your phone?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:32.572
Yeah, it's under "husband."

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:34.032
Okay. Yep.

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:35.659
"Husband."

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:37.160
Here we go.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.039
Please leave your message...

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.416
It goes to voicemail.

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.418
That's a fucking great
husband you have.

01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:47.421
First ditches you,
now doesn't answer your calls.

01:06:47.546 --> 01:06:50.006
Real marriage my ass, man.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:51.466
He's flown the
coop.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.343
Fucking little piece of shit.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.303
I don't know what
kind of...

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:57.264
fucked-up family shit
is going on here,

01:06:57.389 --> 01:06:59.599
but Ivan and I
are married, okay?

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:03.311
This is a real marriage,
and I'm not getting a divorce.

01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:09.025
This is not a real marriage.

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:10.402
This is a real marriage.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.945
Okay, and we're
getting it annulled,

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.905
and you have no say in it.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.073
Well, I'm his fucking wife,

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.617
so I do think
I have a say in it.

01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:19.286
Absolutely not.
Listen to what I'm telling you.

01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:20.996
You got married illegally,

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:22.914
it's a fraud marriage,
and we're

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.125
- getting it annulled A.S.A.P.
- A fraud marriage?

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:29.337
No, we are two consenting
adults who got married legally,

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.298
and there is nothing
you can fucking do about it.

01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:32.924
No, this is Ivan
just fooling around!

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.801
- Would you get over it?
- No, it's not.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:36.803
- You have no fucking idea.
- Oh, yeah?

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.346
When'd you guys meet, huh?

01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:40.307
- When did you meet him?
-Strip club.

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:43.101
I am telling you,
you do not know this guy.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.394
I do know him.

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:46.438
You do not know this guy,
I'm telling you.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.690
- Oh, I know my husband. I do.
- No, you don't.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.401
It's classic Ivan. I've been dealing with his shit
since he was...

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.944
- he was six years old.
- Classic Ivan.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.696
And now his parents
are gonna kill me,

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:57.699
and my fucking family
will never talk to me again.

01:07:58.784 --> 01:08:00.619
Little bastard.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.704
And you left the baptism
half way because of this guy.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.664
- Tell me about it.
- Oh my God.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.166
I love my husband,

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.835
and I plan on being with him
forever.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.504
No, don't give me
that bullshit.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.881
Do not give me that bullshit.
You don't love him.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.634
You do not love him,
and he doesn't love you.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:18.011
You understand?
That's in your head.

01:08:19.137 --> 01:08:21.681
I can't wait to have
Ivan's children.

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:23.809
In fact, I think
I'm probably already pregnant.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.770
I-I certainly hope
you're lying,

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:28.980
'cause we're gonna have to
take care of that, too.

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:31.233
- I promise you that.
- Oh, the-the fuck you will.

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:33.235
- Yes, we will.
- And I would like all of you

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.945
to fucking untie me
and leave my home,

01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:37.155
- or I will be pressing charges.
- Your home?!

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.741
- Yeah, my home.
- This isn't Ivan's home.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:41.868
This is his father's house.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.287
Everything Ivan has
belongs to his father.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.706
You understand?
Ivan has nothing.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:49.084
You know that bedroom
you've been fucking in?

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:50.585
That's his parents' room.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.420
Do you know
where is Ivan's room?

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.757
It's down the hall with fucking
spaceships on the walls.

01:08:55.882 --> 01:08:57.509
Do you know why?

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.135
- Do you know why?
- Fucking tell me why.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:00.637
You're already gonna
tell me, so...

01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:02.305
Because he's a fucking child.
That's why.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.182
Fucking kid.

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:11.606
You don't understand--
he's shamed his family

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.984
by marrying somebody like you.

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:16.278
If you think for a second
this is gonna be allowed,

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:17.696
you're dead wrong.

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:21.241
In fact, if-if you don't
help me fix this,

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:22.951
I'm gonna have you arrested.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.411
Yeah.

01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:26.121
- I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Arrested?

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:27.414
Yeah.

01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:28.999
- That's fucking hilarious.
- Yep.

01:09:29.124 --> 01:09:30.917
- Arrested for what?
- For what?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.460
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you for what.

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:33.461
- Trespassing.
- "Trespassing."

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:36.047
Fraud, cheating.

01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:38.341
- Theft.
- Theft?

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.343
-Yes, theft.
- Assault.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:44.014
And I... actually, the picture
is very, very clear here.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:48.393
A scheming prostitute
married Ivan, cheated...

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.103
cheated Ivan to marry her

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.023
so she can steal
from his wealthy family.

01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:55.442
- That's it.
-Mm-hmm. Definitely.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:57.569
And I'm sure you already
have criminal record, so...

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.447
For sure happened.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.574
Yeah. One, two, three,
you're in jail.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.534
-Easy.
-Yep.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.369
Ivan proposed to me.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.204
He wanted to get married.

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.956
He put a fucking ring
on my finger.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.583
- Do you see this shit?
-What ring?

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.543
He bought me
a fucking four-carat ring.

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:15.295
Does this look real to you, motherfucker?

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.631
Bet you've never seen one
of these before, have you, huh?

01:10:17.756 --> 01:10:19.633
Take that ring off
her finger.

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:21.468
-  No. No.
-  Take it off.

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:23.428
This is my fucking
ring Ivan gave me.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.056
- Give me that fucking ring.
- I am not giving you the fucking ring.

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:28.808
-  Why? Take that fucking ring off!
-  You touch me,

01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:30.936
and I will fucking scream, motherfucker.
Do not come for me.

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.979
Get that fucking ring off of her.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:34.689
-Be careful.
-Hold the legs.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:35.941
Careful, bro!

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.489
This is Zakharov's property.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:45.075
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
-Shut up. Shut up.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.952
Rape!

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:48.662
Hey, hey, don't scream.

01:10:48.787 --> 01:10:49.871
Hey, what-what is she saying?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:52.374
- Rape! Rape!
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:53.875
Is she saying, "Rape"?
Is she...

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.460
What? What? Shut up!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:56.878
She bites!

01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.296
Ouch!

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.006
Don't go
near to her.

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.216
Shut her mouth!

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.717
Somebody is going to call the
police!

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.511
- How?
- You got to shut her up!

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.846
- How? I need a rag or something!
- Motherfucker!

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.264
Shut the
fuck up.

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.517
Stop screaming.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.769
Please stop screaming.

01:11:12.894 --> 01:11:16.856
Please stop screaming!

01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:48.138
You get us
in front of that judge

01:11:48.263 --> 01:11:49.764
first thing in the morning,

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.850
or the family cuts ties
with your firm.

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.935
Simple as that.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.146
No, no... no trying.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.817
Everything will be okay.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.324
Yeah.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.918
Time to break this
bitch. Let's go.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.059
You calm now?

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.020
You gonna behave?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.775
Careful.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.530
Trust me, I know.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.992
I know what you're thinking.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:53.578
You're thinking
this little shit betrayed you.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:57.540
Well, guess what,
he betrayed me, too, okay?

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:58.666
Me, too.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:12:59.876
You see?

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.212
He betrayed all of us.

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:05.590
'Cause he's a spoiled brat
that doesn't want to grow up.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.550
Big-time.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.511
And now we're in this mess
that we have to...

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:10.762
we have to fix it together.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.514
You understand?

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:17.477
But I'm gonna help you.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.687
Okay? I'm gonna help you.

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.734
The way I see it, this is
a green card marriage.

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:29.280
Therefore, Ivan owes you
a green card marriage fee.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.201
It's only fair.

01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:35.578
So, once this thing
is annulled,

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:39.165
I'm gonna make sure you get
$10,000 fee in cash.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.459
Hmm?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.713
I'm gonna bring this down,
but no screaming, okay?

01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:47.841
If you scream,
this goes right back in.

01:13:47.966 --> 01:13:49.551
You understand?

01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:01.688
Ten K.

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:04.190
It's as good as you're
gonna get here, honey.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.153
What do you say?

01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:15.410
I want to talk to Ivan
before agreeing to any of this.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.662
Sure. Of course.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.414
We all want to talk to Ivan.

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:21.291
We want the same thing.

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:31.092
Okay, so let's
fucking find Ivan.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:32.886
All right, but look at me.

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:34.804
Look at me.

01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:39.767
Once we find Ivan--
which we will--

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:43.563
and we get this thing
annulled-- which we will--

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.732
you're gonna walk away
with ten K fee

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:48.026
and never, ever
contact Ivan again.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.402
Is that understood?

01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:55.867
Fine.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:01.998
Untie her.

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:05.043
You got their
marriage license and passport?

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.240
Excuse me,
I have to get dressed.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.283
Can I have some privacy, please?

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.502
Anora Mikheeva?

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.587
Ani. It's Ani.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.089
It says Anora.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:52.924
I know, but I go by Ani.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.634
- Thank you.
- Okay, get in.

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:56.052
So I'm done?

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:59.389
You're with us
until we find him. Get in.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.228
Wait, why is...
why is he getting back here?

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:08.398
- I'm not sitting next to this fucking psychopath.
-  Can I sit in the front?

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:10.858
-  You are the fucking psychopath.
- Yes, get in the front.

01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:13.861
I don't want to fucking sit next to you.
I'm not getting back there with you.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:14.821
Un-fucking-believable.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.115
Klara, come here.

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:20.410
It's a bit messier
than usual today.

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:23.121
So this is for you.
No questions.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.797
So you're
saying he's gonna be there?

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:34.090
I have no fucking idea.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:35.508
He better be.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.093
Okay, let's go!

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:39.470
I need to go to the hospital...

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.473
No, you're okay.
Don't worry about it.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:44.142
No, I'm not, bro.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:47.395
I feel like I have
a concussion or something.

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.690
- I'm sorry for what...
-Let's go!

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.108
Let's go! Let's go!

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:53.026
...was happening back there.

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:56.904
-  How could I have imagined...
- I don't want your dude talking to me, okay?

01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:00.074
Leave her the fuck alone, man!

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.910
My head is pounding, bro.

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:04.370
- You can't even...
-Shut it, Garnik!

01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:09.208
Oh, my God, we're gonna get into a fucking
car accident with you driving like that.

01:17:09.334 --> 01:17:11.210
Are you suicidal or something?
- Just shut the fuck up.

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:14.505
- You almost hit that fucking old lady.
- What do you know about driving? What do you know?

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.550
You shut the fuck up.
Swing by my place and I will give

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:20.011
him something so he'll stop whining.
You've been bitching and moaning

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.555
this entire fucking car ride about a little
fucking scratch on your face.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.640
You're the biggest fucking pussy I ever met.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.192
Just don't eat all
at once.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.075
TOROS
What the fuck?

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:43.701
Okay, let's go.
It doesn't matter.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.495
- Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:51.834
A little bit faster.

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:53.628
Hurry up.

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:05.181
- Hey, Crystal.
-Hey, Ani.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:08.684
- Hey, have you seen Vanya today?
- No, why? Is everything okay?

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.979
No? Uh, yeah, everything's fine.
Could you give him a call for me, please?

01:18:12.647 --> 01:18:15.525
- Okay. What's going on?
- I just need you to call him.

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:18.194
- Can you do me a favor and call him?
- Um...

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:21.906
Don't ask too many questions.
Just pick up your phone and call him.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.033
Okay. Tom? Tom, Ani's here...
-Miss?

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.743
-Hey, Tom.
- What's up, Ani?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.537
Have you seen Vanya today?

01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:30.289
- I have not. No.
- Okay, has he, like, texted or called you at all?

01:18:30.415 --> 01:18:33.835
No, not at all. No.
Okay, could you just call him right now

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.795
- for me?
- Wait. Who are these dudes?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.381
-My friend, can you...
-It's fine. Can you call Ivan, please?

01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.216
- Is everything okay?
- Wait, what's going on?

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:41.801
- Everything is fine.
- Why would I call Ivan?

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:44.929
- Just pick up your phone and call him.
- I'm not gonna call him. Who are you?

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.390
Doesn't matter who I am.
I just need you to call him.

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:50.059
It does matter. I'm not gonna give you
- my fucking phone to call Ivan.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.645
Listen. Ivan is in a lot of trouble. We need to
find him.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:54.939
Hey, hey, one of you better get Ivan on the line
now.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.274
"On... on the line"?

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:57.900
- "On the line"?
- What the fuck is funny?

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.445
- Who the fuck are these guys?
- What the fuck is funny, man?

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:03.197
I'm telling you to call Ivan. What's wrong
with that? Don't complicate your life.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:05.324
Man, I'm gonna come back there and just gonna
fucking...

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.160
I'll complicate your fucking life,
you motherfucker.

01:19:07.285 --> 01:19:09.537
- Why?
- That's not a good idea. That is not a good idea.

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:10.872
Get the fuck out of here.

01:19:10.997 --> 01:19:12.373
-Tom.
-  What's up, man?

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:14.625
Tough guy. What do you plan
to do with that?

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.627
Break your legs
if you don't get the fuck out.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.880
I told
you it's a fucking bad idea.

01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:21.340
- Tom.
-So pick up your phone and call him now.

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:22.925
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Tom.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:26.012
Fuck off.
Fucking smash everything.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.766
-What the fuck?
-Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:33.060
Tell him to
fucking stop! What the fuck?

01:19:33.186 --> 01:19:35.313
-Oh, no.
- Fucking call Ivan now!

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:36.939
-What the fuck, man?
-Okay, okay.

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:38.483
- Jesus, fuck!
-That's crazy.

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.443
- Oh, fuck.
-I am so fucked.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:42.528
Put it on speaker.

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:44.614
I am so fucked.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:45.865
Please leave your message...

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.575
-Where's your phone?
-Hold on, man.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.118
Just don't break anything,
all right?

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:50.495
-Call him.
- What the fuck?

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.497
- Put it on speaker.
- There you go. There you go.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.581
Just don't break anything, man.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.625
He's not gonna answer the
phone. He's not gonna answer.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.460
- I know. I know it.
- Please leave your message...

01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:59.170
He's not gonna fucking answer.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.171
Where's his other friend?

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.422
Is he with Aleks?

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.508
Aleks is working right now.
He can't be with Aleks.

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:05.676
- Where is he working?
-Tatiana's.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.053
-Fuck.
- Let's go.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:09.388
TOM
No. Oh, no.

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:11.390
What the hell?

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:16.145
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Where are you going?

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.356
- To the car.
- It's five-minute walk.

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.858
- No, no, no. I'm not walking down there.
- Let's drive up there.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.152
- It's fucking freezing.
- No, I'm not gonna look for other parking.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.862
- Come on, let's go.
- Why don't we drive?

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.155
It's right here. Walk.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.782
Chop-chop. Move.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.825
It's fucking cold,
man. Look at me.

01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.827
Are you doing this on purpose?
What the fuck, bro.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.338
That took
way fucking longer

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:43.422
than five minutes.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.383
Hey.

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.051
Table for four?

01:20:47.385 --> 01:20:49.512
Is Aleks here?
Aleks?

01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:51.264
Aleks?

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:52.390
He should be working here.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:53.849
- The assistant cook?
- Yes.

01:20:53.975 --> 01:20:55.935
-  Let's go.
- No, wait. Hold on.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.145
- You guys cannot go in there.
- No, you're good. You're good.

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:00.064
They know
what they're doing, relax.

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:03.442
-  Oh, my God, Aleks.
- Ani!

01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:05.528
- Have you seen Vanya?
- No. What's going on?

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:07.572
We're looking for Vanya.
It's a family emergency.

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:09.907
-Have you seen Ivan?
- What the fuck is going on?

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.576
- Have you seen Ivan?
- No.

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:14.245
-  You're good. No, you're good.
-  I can get fired.

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:15.246
You're good. Don't worry.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.123
- Don't worry about it.
- Can you call him, please?

01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:19.417
- I haven't seen him. Call him? Really?
- Yes, just call him.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.752
-Yes, please call him. Call him.
- Are you an actress?

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.838
I saw you somewhere? Uh?
- I'm not an actress, no.

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.798
No? You look good.
Where are you from?

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.800
Give me your phone
one second. One second.

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:30.136
We can't find Vanya anywhere.
Have you talked to him today?

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:32.722
- No, I haven't saw him. He's probably at home.
-  No, he's not

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:34.890
at home, and Tom and Crystal
haven't seen him, either.

01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:36.767
Can I have my phone back, please?
Thank you.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.185
- I need Ivan's photo.
- Okay.

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:40.479
You got to have your husband's
photo on your phone.

01:21:40.605 --> 01:21:43.441
- No, I am not giving you my phone.
- I need your phone for one second.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:45.735
- I just need your phone...
- I... No, and you know what?

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.570
If you touch me again,
I will fucking scream.

01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:49.322
-Shh, shh. Stop. Stop.
-  Use Instagram.

01:21:49.447 --> 01:21:50.948
I don't have
Instagram.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.700
I'm an adult, man. What are you talking about?

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.660
You're going to cost me
my job here. Please.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.329
I have it. Here.

01:21:56.454 --> 01:21:57.830
-  Guys.
- Oh, okay.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.415
- Ani, what's-what's going on?
- We're looking for...

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.709
We're looking for Vanya.
We don't know where he is.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.252
But it's like,
this nigga's fucking insane.

01:22:03.377 --> 01:22:05.588
Okay, thank you. Where...

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.174
Where are you going?

01:22:13.471 --> 01:22:14.930
You think that
he would be with Dasha?

01:22:15.056 --> 01:22:17.642
Not unless
he's in Bahamas with her

01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:19.560
and her new fuck boy.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.481
Stop the music one second.
Stop the music.

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:27.193
Excuse me, I'm
terribly sorry.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.445
But I need one minute
of your attention.

01:22:29.779 --> 01:22:33.074
We are looking for
a missing child, a sick child.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.409
I'm going to show you his photo.

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:38.120
Any information
would be greatly appreciated.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:41.082
<i>We're the ones fucking paying
and he wants attention?</i>

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:44.585
My apologies,
but the kid is very sick.

01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:47.463
Please let us know
if you've seen him.

01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:49.715
You didn't see him?

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.886
- Give me a cigarette.
- Are you kidding me?

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:56.972
I'm freezing,
and this guy wants cigarettes.

01:22:57.348 --> 01:22:58.974
Toros, seriously...

01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:08.526
You'll get cold
if you don't cover your neck.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.197
Why did you bring that?

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.867
Why the fuck
did you bring that?

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:20.371
Why? So you could
fucking gag me again?

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.081
Motherfucker.

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:39.473
Fuck it. Give me the scarf.

01:24:04.999 --> 01:24:08.043
No! No! No!
Swear to God!

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:12.006
Hey! Hey! This is my car!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:13.591
- No, no, no.
- Man, it's already attached.

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.593
- Please.
- It's already attached. I got to take it.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:18.137
- I got to take it in.
- Don't take my car. Don't do that.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.765
- This is my car.
- Hey, listen to me. Hey! It's your fault!

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.892
You were parked in the middle
of the fucking street, okay?

01:24:23.017 --> 01:24:25.019
My friend, I was just parking!
There is no sign.

01:24:25.144 --> 01:24:26.854
- I'll give you money. How much?
- Listen to me.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:29.690
- 100, 200, 300? Tell me.
- Listen, down in the yard, you're gonna talk to

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:30.733
- people.
- Take the money.

01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:32.276
- Okay? You're gonna talk...
- Take the money.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.528
- Fuck you, then. Fuck you.
- What do you mean, fuck me?

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.530
- Fuck you.
-What the... I don't give a shit.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:38.282
- Hey.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:39.492
You get out the fucking car!

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:41.160
You fucking asked for this.

01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:47.750
I've been on the job
two fucking weeks, bro!

01:24:47.875 --> 01:24:50.753
What the fuck are you...
Are you fucking kidding?

01:24:50.878 --> 01:24:52.129
Fucking kidding me!

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.756
- Oh, my fucking God.
-Jesus Christ!

01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.216
Are you fucking...

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.383
It's all because of you.

01:24:56.509 --> 01:24:58.177
- It's all because of you.
- Fuck you!

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:00.054
-Get in the car!
- Come on! Come on!

01:25:00.179 --> 01:25:02.139
You are so fucked. I have your license
plate.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.974
If you get in that car,
you're all fucked.

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:05.351
No, no, no, no, no!

01:25:05.476 --> 01:25:07.061
What the fuck are you doing?

01:25:07.186 --> 01:25:08.646
- Fuck you, Russians!
-God.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.606
Jesus Christ.
You are crazy.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:13.067
You guys are
fucking crazy.

01:25:13.192 --> 01:25:14.443
We're going to find this fucker

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.904
even if it takes
all fucking night.

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:19.824
I swear on my
mother's life...

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.660
What the fuck did you just do?

01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:26.705
Come on,
give me something. Like, something.

01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:27.957
Some... Where would you...

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:30.084
-I don't know. -I don't know.
-Think. Think. Where?

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.669
He... Gaming.
He likes video games.

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:34.380
Maybe he'll be at an arcade
or something. I don't know.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:39.969
Hurry up.
Stay awake, man.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:43.556
Guys,
anybody see this guy today?

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.642
Have you seen Vanya Zakharov?

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.604
Guys, see this kid today?

01:25:51.856 --> 01:25:53.190
TOROS
Oh! Billiard hall.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:54.608
There-there is
the billiard hall.

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:56.360
Remember five years ago we...

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.404
you-you were teaching him
how to play billiard?

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:00.281
We played here,
right here around the corner.

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:02.449
- You remember?
-Five years ago?

01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:03.868
I remember.

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:08.581
Come, come.
One second, my friend.

01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:10.291
Look at this picture.
Have you seen

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:11.542
- this guy?
- Ivan, Ivan.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:12.835
- Is that Vanya?
- Yeah.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.086
Have you seen him today?

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.546
-No, not today.
-No.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.256
He does the greatest
parties, though.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.465
Yeah, he's really cool.

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:21.093
I hate this bitch so much,

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:23.470
I want to vomit
when I see her face.

01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:26.056
AUTOMATED VOICE
Please leave your message...

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:28.142
Guys, have you seen this guy?

01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:30.311
He's-he's been missing.

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:32.646
You sure?

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:34.857
Let me ask them.

01:26:34.982 --> 01:26:37.401
- Wait, stop.
- Give me a second.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:40.112
Guys, have
you seen this... this guy today?

01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:41.697
No.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.201
He's probably not
lost, perhaps he is kidnapped.

01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:49.455
Yeah sure, kidnapped...
Of course.

01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:54.293
Think, think,
think, think.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.170
And can you keep
calling him, please?

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:01.550
What the fuck?

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.761
-  Oh, my God.
- Oh, you got to be

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:05.638
- fucking kidding me!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.641
You understand that my wife

01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:10.809
has to drive this car tomorrow?

01:27:10.935 --> 01:27:12.394
Do you?

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:15.356
How am I gonna get rid
of this smell? Huh?

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:18.859
It's better
you go back to Yerevan.

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:21.862
Fucking get rid of you.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.489
Do you want to blow us up?

01:27:23.614 --> 01:27:25.574
- I'm careful.
- Fuck off!

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:26.951
Get the fuck out of here!

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.455
You care about
Ivan more than me.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.415
Start cleaning!

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:37.294
Who's more important?
Ivan or your dying brother?

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.213
Yeah, I'm not
getting back in there.

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:41.924
-  Fuck Ivan. Fuck that little bitch.
- Mm-mm.

01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:44.718
It still fucking
stinks in here.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.388
Fuck, I know. Shit!

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:51.725
Which clubs did you go
with him?

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:53.185
- I don't know. We went to...
- Huh?

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.437
I don't know.
We went to a lot of 'em.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.147
Take me to every single one.

01:27:59.233 --> 01:28:01.610
Hey, have you seen
this guy today?

01:28:01.735 --> 01:28:04.446
Yeah, we cut him off.
He was wasted.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:05.698
When?

01:28:05.823 --> 01:28:07.783
Like 20 minutes ago.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.076
He just left.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:11.662
Have you guys seen
this guy today?

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:13.956
No?

01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:16.291
Did you ask about
Ivan Zakharov?

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:19.878
- He left me an $800 bill.
- Where is he now?

01:28:20.004 --> 01:28:22.381
How should I know?
But somebody has to pay me.

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:25.050
-  Okay, bye.
- No, wait. But you know him.

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:26.552
I told him my apologies.

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:28.137
You can tell him one more time.

01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:30.055
I'm gonna definitely
make them up to you.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.849
Or up to them, or up to you.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.436
Wh-What can I do?

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:37.312
Wh-What do you want me to do?

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:39.398
He's fine.

01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:42.067
Tell his mom
that everything is fine,

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:43.360
he's sitting next to me.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.112
Is it a real mink?

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:48.115
I'm telling you...
I can't talk anymore. I have to go.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.616
No.

01:28:49.742 --> 01:28:51.285
Please, I'm begging you.
Please stop.

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:53.537
Oh.
It looks like real mink.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.206
Of course I do. Why you...
I am ashamed as well.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.417
Yeah, it's fucking
real, but it's not mink.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:01.545
-  I'm the godfather of that child.
-  It's fucking Russian sable, okay?

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.338
Which is worth
a lot more than mink.

01:29:03.464 --> 01:29:04.882
Of course I'm
ashamed.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:06.258
No,
don't-don't ta...

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.301
don't talk
about that baby.

01:29:07.426 --> 01:29:09.470
Guys, have you seen
this guy today?

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:14.767
-  End of the line.
- I just have a question.

01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:16.727
Have you seen this kid?

01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:18.937
Yeah,
he was here 30 minutes ago.

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:20.606
He was too drunk to enter.

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.691
- Do you know where he went?
- Who the fuck knows.

01:29:23.108 --> 01:29:24.276
Your I.D., please.

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.528
What a shitty godfather you are.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:29.198
Instead of protecting the child,
you just left him.

01:29:29.323 --> 01:29:31.158
Are you fucking with me?

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:33.494
Maybe he's on a bender.

01:29:34.912 --> 01:29:36.497
If you're so competent,

01:29:36.622 --> 01:29:37.706
why did you let him leave?

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.541
How do you say bender?

01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.335
Uh, "bender."

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.046
It-it's a bender. Yeah.

01:29:44.713 --> 01:29:47.049
Tor, what does
that have to do with competence?

01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:49.635
Fuck this shit.
I didn't sign up for this.

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:54.098
I just want to go home
to Armenia. This sucks.

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.949
♪ All the things she said,
all the things she said ♪

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:14.243

runnin' through my head ♪

01:30:14.368 --> 01:30:16.745

01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.878
I'm so fucked.

01:30:26.213 --> 01:30:28.173
So fucked!

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:36.098
You know, he fucked me
much harder than he fucked you.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.350
- Oh, yeah?
- Hundred percent.

01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:41.061
Trust me.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:44.857
If we haven't found him by now,
we are not finding him.

01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:47.985
Did I ask you? Did I ask you?

01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:49.820
I'm just saying, man.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:51.405
Keep your opinion
to yourself.

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:54.324
I'm not going to
talk at all from now on.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:04.084
Ani's fucking
billionaire husband

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.211
just strolled in,
and he's looking for action.

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:08.380
And I'm gonna give him some.

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:10.382
Vanya?

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.009
Vanya.

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:13.677
You know, it's so sad.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.346
That marriage must really be
in the toilet already.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:17.514
Vanya's here?

01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:21.101
'Scuse!

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:25.063
- Have you seen this guy today?
- No.

01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:26.773
How about you, sir?

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:29.401
Igor, thank you
for the pills.

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.699
I want what he
had. I want one of those.

01:31:44.875 --> 01:31:47.878
Did you fucking hear me?
I said, "I want one of those."

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.173
No.

01:31:52.257 --> 01:31:53.258
No?

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.219
What the fuck? Why?

01:31:55.344 --> 01:31:57.387
'Cause I don't deal drugs.

01:31:57.512 --> 01:31:59.640
A fucking gopnik who can afford
to live in Brightwater

01:31:59.765 --> 01:32:01.141
and doesn't deal drugs?

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:02.684
Yeah, right.

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:06.563
It's my grandmother's apartment
and her drugs.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:24.039
I don't have any more,
and I'm not gopnik.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.250
Yeah, you're right.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:28.627
You're a faggot-ass bitch,
is what you are.

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:31.338
Hey, guys, have you seen
this guy today?

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:32.756
No.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:35.592
What does
faggot-ass bitch mean?

01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:38.637
Fucking faggot.

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.681
Yep, what he said.

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:45.185
-  Go away!
- Why are you being rude?

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.021
I'm just asking a question.
I don't give a shit.

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:52.651
And why am I
faggot-ass bitch?

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:55.821
I don't know.

01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:58.115
They say you're
just born that way.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:04.871
You know what, I'm so
sick of your generation, man.

01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:06.331
I mean, look at you.

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:08.166
No respect for elder,

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:10.961
no respect for authority,
no goals.

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:13.463
I mean, the only goal you have
just to buy

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.132
pair of cool sneakers.
That's all.

01:33:15.257 --> 01:33:16.550
I mean, honestly. Come on.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.135
What the fuck
is wrong with you? Huh?

01:33:19.678 --> 01:33:23.515
Why don't you just
hear me out?

01:33:23.849 --> 01:33:26.393
No work ethics.

01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.020
Lazy, stupid.

01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:29.438
I don't understand.

01:33:29.563 --> 01:33:32.274
I've been working
since I'm 16 years old.

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:34.693
What is wrong with you?

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:37.446
All you do is TikTok,
Instagram, TikTok, Instagram.

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:38.488
That's it.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:39.698
He's at HQ!

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:40.907
What?

01:33:41.033 --> 01:33:42.701
Fucking Headquarters!

01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:47.706
Hey. Hello.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.708
-What's the address?
-West 38th Street.

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:51.251
Whoo!

-You little son of a bitch.
- Why'd you fucking leave me, Vanya?

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:16.938
I tried to run after you. These guys, they fucking
tied my wrists up. They took my ring.

01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:18.857
-For what, bro?
- They fucking assaulted me, Vanya.

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:21.193
Okay, get up. Let's go.
You can talk in the car.

01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:22.944
- Get up.
-No, I fucking found

01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:24.946
him, so I get to fucking
talk to him.

01:36:25.071 --> 01:36:26.907

- Vanya, our hour's not over.

01:36:27.032 --> 01:36:28.533
Oh, get her the fuck

Vanya, look at me.

01:36:38.668 --> 01:36:39.961
Just listen to me, baby, listen.

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:42.130
These guys, they want us
to get a divorce, okay?

01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:43.507
It's not divorce.

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:45.884
- I told you hundred times.
-Back off. Let me...

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.260
It's annulment. Annulment.

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.595
-Ah.
-Vanya, tell them

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.347
that we're not gonna
get a divorce, okay?

01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:53.058
- Tell them that this is a mistake.
-  Are my parents here yet?

01:36:53.183 --> 01:36:55.435
-  Baby, this is very important.
-Listen to me here.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.687
No, no, no. We... TOROS: Your parents
are coming at 12:00.

01:36:57.812 --> 01:37:00.315
I helped you find him,
so let me fucking talk to him.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.317
We still need
to go to the courthouse!

01:37:02.442 --> 01:37:05.237
Vanya, just look at me, okay?
Fucking ignore them. It doesn't fucking matter

01:37:05.362 --> 01:37:08.281
about her. It doesn't matter about anything, okay?
Just... I need you to tell them...

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:09.991
Vanya, this is not funny.

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:11.618
I know. It's not.

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:14.287
Vanya, look at me, baby.

Yeah, I love them. I love them.

This is very,

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:24.422
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

01:37:24.548 --> 01:37:26.174
Okay, but just-just... Look what he...

No, no, no, Vanya,
we can't drink right now.

01:37:28.426 --> 01:37:30.095

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.191
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- Whoa, whoa. Is he all right there?

01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:13.318
Does he fucking look
all right to you?

01:41:13.443 --> 01:41:15.695
-He is okay.
- He is not fucking all right.

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:17.697
- He can barely stand.
- How are you?

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:19.616
Fine, thanks. Uh, the judge
is being very kind,

01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:20.992
and he bumped us up.

01:41:21.117 --> 01:41:23.077
-Good.
- Hello, Ivan.

01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:29.209
Ivan, it's Michael
Sharnov, your father's attorney.

01:41:29.334 --> 01:41:31.377
Remember me?
You don't remember Uncle Michael?

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:34.380
He's a little bit
tired.

01:41:34.506 --> 01:41:35.465
- It's okay.
- I see.

01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:36.800
Tired?

01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:39.052
And this is the...

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:41.930
The lucky lady.

01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:45.725
- Okay. And who is this?
- Him we're gonna need.

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.227
Just holding.

01:41:47.727 --> 01:41:49.646
Okay, I don't know
what that means,

01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:50.855
and I don't want to know.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.652
Let's go. Get your I.D.'s ready.
I talked to him

01:41:56.069 --> 01:42:01.282
and it's clear he wants this done.
But does he know that his son is intoxicated?

01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:03.827
He's not intoxicated,
he just woke up.

01:42:03.952 --> 01:42:05.495
Toros, please.
Come on, man.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:07.580
I'm not gonna risk my license
because you can't...

01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:09.833
You want to keep working
for Zakharov family or not?

01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:14.796
Oh.

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:19.342
Mr. Sharnov.
Consider yourself very fortunate.

01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:20.468
Your Honor.

01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:24.514
We have a light calendar today, so, um,
what's your urgent matter?

01:42:25.557 --> 01:42:30.186
Your Honor, we are here to file a complaint and
request for an immediate annulment of a union

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:33.356
that took place
under duress.

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.359
- Ivan Zakharov and Anora Mikheeva married...
- Duress, my fucking ass.

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:37.610
- Okay.
-Whoa!

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:41.197
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Your Honor, but this
is bullshit. It's bullshit.

01:42:41.322 --> 01:42:43.032
-Your Honor, I...
- These men are trying to...

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.201
You got to stop. You can't... you can't talk
this way.

01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:47.245
Okay. I'm sorry. They're trying... Do not
fucking touch me.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:50.290
Who's this man in the camel coat?
Security, please get this man away from me.

01:42:50.415 --> 01:42:52.625
Who are you, sir?
Mr. Sharnov, is he with you?

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:53.835
Get... Get him away from me.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.962
-Come on, come on. Come on.
-Officer, take him...

01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:58.298
-Your Honor, I apologize.
-Thank you, Officer. I appreciate it.

01:42:58.423 --> 01:43:00.091
- Okay, have a seat. Have a seat.
- I'm sorry.

01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:02.051
And thank you, Your Honor. I really
appreciate it.

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.845
- You're welcome. You're welcome. Keep that tone.
-Okay.

01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:05.763
- You're welcome.
- Your Honor, clearly, my husband is intoxicated

01:43:05.889 --> 01:43:08.892
right now. He is in no place
to be making any decisions.

01:43:09.017 --> 01:43:10.727
Uh, Your Honor, objection.
She shouldn't be talking.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.520
Don't listen to her, please.

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:14.188
-Camel coat, sit down. Down.
- My stomach.

01:43:14.314 --> 01:43:16.566
He is clearly intoxicated, Your Honor.
- Why is she talking?

01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:19.652
Your Honor, I apologize. Your Honor, what I have
been trying to explain to you,

01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:21.237
- we got married legally.
- Objection, Your Honor.

01:43:21.362 --> 01:43:23.156
They're not legally married, and she shouldn't
be talking.

01:43:23.281 --> 01:43:24.782
- Sir. Sir.
-I shouldn't be talking?

01:43:24.908 --> 01:43:26.701
- Camel man, sit down.
- My apologies.

01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:29.537
Your Honor, I-I apologize. My client
doesn't know what she's saying. I'm sorry.

01:43:29.662 --> 01:43:31.831
And they are trying to force us
to get an annulment...

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:33.708
- I-I am intoxicated.
-Sit quietly or begone. Please.

01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:36.169
We got legally married at a legitimate
marriage place in Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:43:36.294 --> 01:43:39.255
- Miss, please keep it down. Keep it down.
- It is real. We have a marriage certificate.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.966
-Mr. Sharnov, take charge now.
-We're not gonna be signing--

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:43.426
They got married in Nevada?

01:43:43.551 --> 01:43:45.470
- So what?
-  We can't get it annulled here.

01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:47.180
- What?
-Thank you for listening, Your Honor.

01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:50.558
We can file for one but if you want
this now, you have to go there.

01:43:50.683 --> 01:43:53.561
-Mr. Sharnov. Last time.
-Do you see what I've been dealing with?

01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:55.063
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:43:55.188 --> 01:43:57.523
-  Folks, get out. Okay that's it.
-  My stomach hurts.

01:43:57.649 --> 01:43:59.150
- No, no, no, no.
-Have a seat.

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:01.611
No, no, no. Officer, get him off the table
before he throws up.

01:44:01.736 --> 01:44:03.071
-I need... I need...
-Fuck!

01:44:03.196 --> 01:44:05.406
-Come on.
- Get him off the table. Get him out.

01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:06.991
-Fuck!
-Everyone out of the court.

01:44:07.116 --> 01:44:08.701
Clear the court, Officer.

01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:09.953
Come on, time to go.

01:44:10.078 --> 01:44:12.622
-Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
-Officer, clear the court, please.

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:14.916
- Why did you go to Vegas? Why not here in New
- York?

01:44:15.041 --> 01:44:17.961
- Guys, you don't have to fucking drag him around.
- Why not here in New York?

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:20.505
Can you explain to me?
We got fucking married in Vegas because

01:44:20.630 --> 01:44:23.424
- that's where he proposed to me.
-So now we're gonna go see your parents.

01:44:23.549 --> 01:44:24.342
Vanya.

01:44:24.467 --> 01:44:26.970
You're gonna explain to them
that you went to Vegas without my permission.

01:44:27.095 --> 01:44:29.639
-No, we're not fucking going anywhere.
- You understand? Because it wasn't my fault.

01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:30.640
-Vanya.
- You, too.

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:32.558
Oh, no, I am not going fucking anywhere.

01:44:32.684 --> 01:44:35.645
You're gonna have to tell them that you-you
took him to Vegas without my permission.

01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:38.690
- I am not going... No, no. -No, no, no. I...
- This is not my fault.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:41.442
- No, we are, we are so...
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

01:44:41.567 --> 01:44:44.112
I'm not getting in the fucking car, 'cause
we're fucking done here. And I

01:44:44.237 --> 01:44:46.489
want my fucking ring now, motherfucker.
You got a ticket?

01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:48.866
-What's going on?
- Vanya, get out of the car, okay?

01:44:48.992 --> 01:44:52.036
You do not have to listen to these people.
Okay? You don't have to listen to

01:44:52.161 --> 01:44:54.038
them because you're an adult, Vanya. You're an
adult, okay?

01:44:54.163 --> 01:44:56.207
You had one job and you get a
ticket?

01:44:56.332 --> 01:44:59.210
I must have dozed off. You dozed off! But I told
you not to fall asleep!

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:02.130
-  Yeah, but are we done?
- You are an adult. You are an adult.

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:03.631
Let's go.

01:45:03.756 --> 01:45:05.842
I just need
to talk with my parents.

01:45:08.428 --> 01:45:10.888
Okay.

01:45:11.014 --> 01:45:12.265
Okay. All right.

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:13.558
We'll talk
to your parents, okay?

01:45:13.683 --> 01:45:15.226
We're gonna talk
to your parents,

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:17.061
and they're gonna understand
because they love you.

01:45:17.186 --> 01:45:18.688
Get in.

01:45:18.813 --> 01:45:20.565
What happened?

01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:22.608
They got married in Vegas,
that's what happened.

01:45:22.734 --> 01:45:25.111
They love you, and
they're gonna understand, okay?

01:45:25.236 --> 01:45:27.113
Vanya, okay? Right?

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:29.282
- They're gonna understand, right?
- Get in the car.

01:45:30.283 --> 01:45:32.660
- Get in the car.
-  What are we going to do now?

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:33.953
This is a never-ending nightmare...

01:45:34.078 --> 01:45:35.663
ANI
Right, Vanya?

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:37.915
Right?

01:45:38.041 --> 01:45:39.459
Get in the car.

01:46:02.482 --> 01:46:05.359
I want him clean
and presentable in ten minutes.

01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:08.279
And, you, behave.

01:46:15.912 --> 01:46:17.246
Once,

01:46:18.039 --> 01:46:23.544
this idiot and his friends
decided to swim in Kool-Aid.

01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:25.254
Vanya.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:27.215
Do you know what is it?
It's a juice.

01:46:28.216 --> 01:46:30.384
They were stoned

01:46:30.843 --> 01:46:33.930
and poured four pounds

01:46:34.472 --> 01:46:37.016
of Kool-Aid in the pool.

01:46:37.558 --> 01:46:40.686
They destroyed the whole system.

01:46:40.812 --> 01:46:44.982
Eighty-seven thousand dollars
in damages.

01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:45.334
Hello, Galina Stepanovna.

01:47:45.459 --> 01:47:47.003
Where is he?

01:47:49.172 --> 01:47:50.882
Okay.

01:47:51.007 --> 01:47:52.758
Showtime.

01:48:01.767 --> 01:48:03.436
Nikolai Zakharov,
how was your flight?

01:48:03.561 --> 01:48:05.188
Face down, ass up.

01:48:05.897 --> 01:48:08.399
I have some bad news.

01:48:08.524 --> 01:48:09.692
Go on.

01:48:10.151 --> 01:48:13.654
- You're not going to be happy.
- I'm already not happy.

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:16.949
What?

01:48:20.119 --> 01:48:21.495
Vanya. Vanya.

01:48:22.997 --> 01:48:25.333
What's wrong with
you? Look at me.

01:48:25.458 --> 01:48:26.918
Are you drunk?

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:29.795
Damn...

01:48:29.921 --> 01:48:31.422
Garnik, he's drunk.

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:33.716
Yes, Galina Stepanovna,

01:48:33.841 --> 01:48:36.510
he's not sober,
but it's not our fault.

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:40.514
Mom, I got it,
I'm already embarrassed.

01:48:40.848 --> 01:48:42.225
- So, you're embarrassed?
- Yes.

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:43.684
So, you're embarrassed?

01:48:43.809 --> 01:48:47.563
You made our family
a national disgrace.

01:48:47.688 --> 01:48:49.649
Galina Zakharova,

01:48:50.775 --> 01:48:52.652
I'm Anora.

01:48:56.948 --> 01:49:00.618
It's so wonderful
to finally meet you.

01:49:01.327 --> 01:49:04.455
It's such an honor
to be Ivan's wife

01:49:05.081 --> 01:49:07.041
and a part
of your beautiful family.

01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:13.965
Ivan is not your
husband,

01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:17.051
and you are not part
of this family.

01:49:18.928 --> 01:49:20.346
And your Russian is
embarrassing.

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:22.556
Is this from the
new collection?

01:49:22.682 --> 01:49:23.474
Yes, new collection.

01:49:23.599 --> 01:49:25.393
Uh, ma'am?

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.312
Ma'am?

01:49:28.437 --> 01:49:30.189
Yes?

01:49:30.314 --> 01:49:32.400
Vanya and I, we are in love,

01:49:32.525 --> 01:49:34.986
and we would like you
to accept that.

01:49:35.111 --> 01:49:37.154
Vanya is not in love with you.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.073
Understand?

01:49:39.198 --> 01:49:40.825
And we will not
accept it, okay?

01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:41.993
Galina.

01:49:44.787 --> 01:49:47.540
Toros has
something to tell you.

01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:50.710
Fuck.

01:49:50.835 --> 01:49:52.962
You are all idiots.

01:49:53.087 --> 01:49:54.964
Vanya, we cannot get
on the fucking plane right now.

01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:57.717
Toros, we will discuss
your future in our company.

01:49:57.842 --> 01:50:01.345
Vanya, why are you listening
to your fucking parents?

01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:02.847
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:50:02.972 --> 01:50:04.765
Vanya, we have to talk
right fucking now, okay?

01:50:04.890 --> 01:50:07.018
Kolya,
hang up the phone already!

01:50:07.143 --> 01:50:08.644
Vanya, we have to
fucking talk.

01:50:08.769 --> 01:50:10.938
No, no, no, no.
Go back to the plane.

01:50:11.063 --> 01:50:14.900
I want us refueled
and in the air in ten minutes.

01:50:15.568 --> 01:50:17.862
Vanya, fucking
look at me. Vanya.

01:50:21.574 --> 01:50:24.702
Vanya, be a fucking man
and talk to me!

01:50:24.827 --> 01:50:27.455
Is it necessary to
take the night butterfly with us?

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:31.125
Yes, both parties
must be present.

01:50:36.255 --> 01:50:38.132
What do you want
me to say?

01:50:43.763 --> 01:50:45.806
Can you understand
that now we must go

01:50:45.931 --> 01:50:50.019
in the fucking plane
and fly to fucking Vegas?

01:50:51.103 --> 01:50:52.605
Get it?

01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:55.941
You get it?

01:50:56.067 --> 01:50:58.277
So we're getting a divorce?
You...

01:50:58.402 --> 01:51:00.821
Of course! Are you stupid?

01:51:11.749 --> 01:51:13.376
Ivan, hurry up!

01:51:13.501 --> 01:51:14.919
One second.

01:51:17.671 --> 01:51:19.215
And thank you...

01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:26.389
...for making my last trip
to America so fun.

01:51:33.104 --> 01:51:35.189
Yeah? You had fun?

01:51:36.107 --> 01:51:37.817
Yeah.

01:51:37.942 --> 01:51:39.485
Let's go.

01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.709
Where is she?

01:51:56.127 --> 01:51:58.045
I don't know, there.

01:52:03.801 --> 01:52:05.970
Board the plane now.

01:52:09.014 --> 01:52:10.558
No.

01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:13.519
No, I'm not doing that.

01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:24.613
You are getting on this plane,
and you are getting divorced.

01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:29.785
Yeah, we're gonna get
a fucking divorce,

01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:32.329
but, uh, first,
I'm getting a lawyer.

01:52:33.372 --> 01:52:35.624
Then I'm gonna sue Ivan
and you,

01:52:35.749 --> 01:52:37.418
and I'm gonna walk away
with fucking half

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:39.378
because I didn't sign a prenup.

01:52:50.598 --> 01:52:54.560
Do that,
and you'll lose everything.

01:52:56.103 --> 01:52:58.272
Any money you may have--

01:52:58.397 --> 01:53:00.941
although I doubt
you have much--

01:53:01.066 --> 01:53:02.776
will be gone.

01:53:04.028 --> 01:53:05.946
Do you have a house?

01:53:07.573 --> 01:53:09.700
Do you have a car?

01:53:11.243 --> 01:53:12.912
All gone.

01:53:15.581 --> 01:53:18.584
Your life and the lives
of your family and friends,

01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:20.586
everything will be destroyed.

01:53:33.432 --> 01:53:35.434
You want to talk
about it now?

01:53:35.559 --> 01:53:38.020
- Yes.
- Because I don't.

01:53:40.481 --> 01:53:43.234
Please show some respect,
I'm hungover.

01:53:43.359 --> 01:53:47.655
If we were your age, and if
we had everything we wanted...

01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:49.823
Listen, you little shit.

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:52.326
Next week,

01:53:52.451 --> 01:53:53.744
you start working.

01:53:53.869 --> 01:53:55.246
Ah.

01:53:56.372 --> 01:53:58.040
Understand, little shit?

01:53:58.165 --> 01:54:00.042
Why do you need me there?

01:54:00.376 --> 01:54:05.297
Maybe it's not the right moment
but I just want to say...

01:54:06.048 --> 01:54:07.800
I'm very happy to finally

01:54:07.925 --> 01:54:11.428
be able to spend time
with your wonderful family...

01:54:11.554 --> 01:54:15.015
Thank you so much
for trusting me and Toros...

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:17.935
Stop it, get out of here.
Are you crazy?

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:21.605
I want to say a couple
of nice things to them.

01:54:26.485 --> 01:54:28.696
Better you married a man.

01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:31.407
So what if I married a man?
Do you think that can't happen?

01:54:31.782 --> 01:54:36.120
Then what kind of freedom
can we talk about?

01:54:36.245 --> 01:54:39.498
If I can't
potentially marry a man?

01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:41.333
- Galina Stepanovna, I just...
- Listen!

01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:45.754
I'm sorry,
I just want to use that moment

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:48.757
- to say thank you...
- Don't interfere!

01:54:48.882 --> 01:54:51.010
We are having
a family discussion.

01:54:53.012 --> 01:54:54.555
So you think it's normal?

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:56.056
Everything that happened
is normal?

01:54:56.181 --> 01:54:58.434
How did you end up in Vegas?

01:54:59.852 --> 01:55:01.353
I understand...

01:55:01.478 --> 01:55:02.605
and forgive you what you did.

01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:04.857
I just bought a
ticket and flew to Vegas!

01:55:04.982 --> 01:55:06.066
Why can't I do that?

01:55:06.191 --> 01:55:08.319
- Who gave you permission?
- Who would forbid me?

01:55:08.444 --> 01:55:09.695
Great.

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.323
You talk about
freedom and then ask why I went to Vegas.

01:55:12.448 --> 01:55:13.991
I'm so grateful
for your forgiveness.

01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:16.118
Why can't I just
fly to Vegas?

01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:17.453
Because you went to study.

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:20.414
Not to party,
drink and get hungover.

01:55:22.041 --> 01:55:24.960
Why make a tragedy out of it?

01:55:25.085 --> 01:55:29.089
What do you want from me?
Do you want me to apologize?

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:30.966
Just kill me, mom!

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.595
What did I do? I just spent
time with an escort.

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.848
I just spent a week with her.
So what's the big deal?

01:55:37.973 --> 01:55:39.808
Why are you making this
such a big deal?

01:55:39.933 --> 01:55:41.727
This isn't our family's
biggest problem.

01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:42.853
- Sit!
- It's not

01:55:42.978 --> 01:55:44.438
going to be a fucking problem.

01:55:44.563 --> 01:55:45.689
I breast-fed you!

01:55:45.814 --> 01:55:48.525
I'm fucking glad
to be divorcing your sorry ass.

01:55:48.651 --> 01:55:50.027
You are fucking pathetic, man.

01:55:50.152 --> 01:55:51.236
Are you seriously?

01:55:51.362 --> 01:55:53.572
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

01:55:54.907 --> 01:55:55.908
Fucking pathetic.

01:55:56.033 --> 01:55:57.576
You're a pathetic motherfucker.

01:55:57.701 --> 01:55:58.911
-Blyat, no.
- See?

01:56:01.705 --> 01:56:03.832
You hurt your
mother so much!

01:56:04.249 --> 01:56:06.585
I gave you everything.

01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:11.215
Kolya,
give me your hand, please.

01:57:13.610 --> 01:57:15.571
I'm just
going to need some signatures.

01:57:15.696 --> 01:57:17.364
If I could just
get that back from...

01:57:17.489 --> 01:57:19.241
Actually, if I could just
hang on to all...

01:57:19.366 --> 01:57:20.826
- Could I just... Thank you.
- Okay, question.

01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:22.578
-Okay. Yes, of course.
-What this mean?

01:57:22.703 --> 01:57:24.204
We don't need
to worry about that.

01:57:24.329 --> 01:57:26.665
- That's for the judge, so...
-Are you sure?

01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:28.625
Um... (laughs) Very sure.

01:57:28.751 --> 01:57:31.044
Okay, so we're just gonna need
some signatures here.

01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:32.963
So there you go,
and this one will be for...

01:57:33.088 --> 01:57:34.673
Come here.

01:57:34.798 --> 01:57:36.592
Sorry, I'm gonna
mispronounce your name.

01:57:36.717 --> 01:57:38.427
-Sign.
-So, Anora Mikheeva,

01:57:38.552 --> 01:57:40.596
I just need
your signature as well.

01:57:40.721 --> 01:57:43.015
Thank you. Oh, oh.

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.308
There you are.

01:57:45.642 --> 01:57:47.269
Where the red box is.

01:57:59.406 --> 01:58:01.867
Sign, please.

01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:11.835
And then--
oh, sorry-- just one more.

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.129
Um...

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:16.548
Great.

01:58:16.673 --> 01:58:17.925
Oh. Oh, um...

01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:19.301
May I have my I.D.?

01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:20.427
You can.

01:58:20.552 --> 01:58:22.638
All right. Let's go. Come on.

01:58:22.763 --> 01:58:24.306
This may be out of
line

01:58:24.431 --> 01:58:27.684
but I think it'd be appropriate
if Ivan apologizes.

01:58:29.812 --> 01:58:32.773
Don't pay attention to him.
He is tired.

01:58:33.398 --> 01:58:35.692
He also drank on
an empty stomach on the plane.

01:58:35.818 --> 01:58:37.110
He helped us all night.

01:58:37.236 --> 01:58:38.153
Listen here...

01:58:39.279 --> 01:58:44.076
My son won't apologize
to anyone. Is that clear?

01:58:44.201 --> 01:58:45.702
Of course.

01:58:45.828 --> 01:58:47.871
'Cause your son
is a fucking pussy.

01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:49.248
What?

01:58:49.373 --> 01:58:50.499
What? What?

01:58:50.624 --> 01:58:53.585
What? Did you not hear what I said?
I said it's 'cause your son's

01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:54.920
- a fucking pussy.
-That's enough.

01:58:55.045 --> 01:58:56.255
Let's go.

01:58:56.713 --> 01:58:58.423
And you are
a disgusting hooker.

01:59:00.968 --> 01:59:06.014
And your son hates you so much
he married one to piss you off.

01:59:06.139 --> 01:59:07.641
That's enough.

01:59:07.766 --> 01:59:08.809
Yeah.

01:59:08.934 --> 01:59:10.853
Yeah, your family
is fucking trash.

01:59:10.978 --> 01:59:12.437
Is this my scarf?

01:59:12.563 --> 01:59:14.648
Yeah, you want...

01:59:17.776 --> 01:59:18.735
There.

01:59:18.861 --> 01:59:20.904
Go get your little scarf, sweetie.

01:59:21.029 --> 01:59:22.573
That's-that's enough. Let's go.

01:59:22.698 --> 01:59:24.032
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm leaving.

01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:26.034
- I'm leaving. You know what?
- Okay. Let's go.

01:59:26.159 --> 01:59:27.619
What are you
laughing at?

01:59:27.744 --> 01:59:30.289
Why don't you take
your fucking coat, too.

01:59:30.414 --> 01:59:31.915
That's enough. Let's go.

01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:38.255
Thank you so much, ma'am.

01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.965
You're very welcome. Um...

01:59:44.928 --> 01:59:46.179
Goodbye, America.

01:59:46.305 --> 01:59:47.514
CLERK
Okay.

01:59:47.639 --> 01:59:48.807
It's for you.

01:59:48.932 --> 01:59:50.267
- Present.
- Sorry. Oh, gosh.

01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:51.643
No, I couldn't.

01:59:51.768 --> 01:59:53.145
Thank you so...
Wait, is-is this real?

01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:00.193
Take them to
McCarran Airport, domestic.

02:00:00.319 --> 02:00:02.571
Igor is gonna take you back.

02:00:02.696 --> 02:00:04.114
You can stay
in the house tonight,

02:00:04.239 --> 02:00:06.658
but you got to be
out of there in the morning.

02:00:07.743 --> 02:00:09.745
And he'll pay you
when the bank opens.

02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:10.954
Go.

02:00:12.331 --> 02:00:13.957
And thank you.

02:01:10.555 --> 02:01:12.766
And it
is starting to stick, as well.

02:01:12.891 --> 02:01:15.477
We'll show you a live look
at the roads in a little bit,

02:01:15.602 --> 02:01:17.938
but officials that we've talked
with today say they are ready

02:01:18.063 --> 02:01:20.148
for whatever Mother Nature
brings the next few days.

02:01:20.273 --> 02:01:21.566
MAN
We got thousands of

02:01:21.692 --> 02:01:23.068
sanitation brothers and sisters
coming in

02:01:23.193 --> 02:01:24.486
doing overtime tonight.

02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:25.946
If it accumulates,
we'll be clearing

02:01:26.071 --> 02:01:27.489
snow and ice from the street.

02:01:27.614 --> 02:01:29.741
Every highway,
every bike lane in the city.

02:01:29.866 --> 02:01:31.952
We'll be out starting
a midnight shift tonight.

02:01:32.077 --> 02:01:33.787
On Long Island,
the salt trucks...

02:01:33.912 --> 02:01:36.707
Happy birthday to me.

02:01:36.832 --> 02:01:38.000
Hmm?

02:01:40.836 --> 02:01:43.422
Was today
your birthday?

02:01:43.547 --> 02:01:45.757
January is
National Blood Donor Month...

02:01:45.882 --> 02:01:47.300
No.

02:01:47.426 --> 02:01:49.136
...is urging people to donate.

02:01:49.261 --> 02:01:51.471
Advocates say the winter months
are a crucial time...

02:01:51.596 --> 02:01:53.265
Yesterday was my birthday.

02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.726
The senior vice
president and chief of staff

02:01:55.851 --> 02:01:57.269
at New York Blood Center,
Clarissa Heyward...

02:01:57.394 --> 02:01:59.896
Yesterday was
your fucking birthday?

02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:04.026
I was 30.

02:02:05.902 --> 02:02:07.112
Mm.

02:02:07.237 --> 02:02:09.239
Happy fucking birthday,
I guess.

02:02:10.699 --> 02:02:12.451
Thank you.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:20.584
I like Anora.

02:02:22.961 --> 02:02:25.797
I mean I like Anora
more than Ani.

02:02:28.091 --> 02:02:30.135
Okay.

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:33.305
Says the fuck head named Igor.

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:36.975
Fucking Igor.

02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.770
Stupid name.

02:02:39.895 --> 02:02:41.938
No, it's a good name.

02:02:44.483 --> 02:02:47.319
It means "varrior."

02:02:47.444 --> 02:02:49.321
Warrior.

02:02:51.948 --> 02:02:53.950
Yeah?

02:02:54.076 --> 02:02:57.079
Igor means "hunchback weirdo,"
you fucking piece of shit.

02:02:57.204 --> 02:02:59.456
Can you shut the fuck up, please?

02:03:02.834 --> 02:03:04.377
"Toosh."

02:03:07.089 --> 02:03:09.841
- "Toosh"?
- "Toosh."

02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:13.053
Touché?

02:03:13.178 --> 02:03:15.639
Touché, motherfucker?

02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:19.643
You know, you really should
try learning English

02:03:19.768 --> 02:03:21.269
before attempting French.

02:03:22.354 --> 02:03:24.106
Okay. Touché.

02:03:24.231 --> 02:03:25.857
Yeah.

02:03:31.113 --> 02:03:33.281
And your name is better?

02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:35.117
No.

02:03:35.242 --> 02:03:37.494
But what does it mean?

02:03:40.914 --> 02:03:43.333
In America, we don't care
about that kind of stuff.

02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:45.335
We don't give meaning to names.

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:48.255
It's... it's not a thing.

02:04:18.577 --> 02:04:21.872
So, it means...

02:04:23.373 --> 02:04:25.041
..."pomegranate fruit."

02:04:25.167 --> 02:04:26.543
"Light."

02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:29.296
Yeah, I'm not interested
in conversation, dude.

02:04:31.548 --> 02:04:33.383
And "bright."

02:04:44.853 --> 02:04:50.150
It's good that you're not
part of this family.

02:04:54.988 --> 02:04:57.365
Did I ask for
your fucking opinion?

02:05:00.994 --> 02:05:03.288
- No.
- No. Exactly.

02:05:13.965 --> 02:05:16.301
I just tried to support you.

02:05:19.054 --> 02:05:21.514
S-Support me?

02:05:23.183 --> 02:05:25.143
Dude, you fucking assaulted me.

02:05:25.268 --> 02:05:27.020
You... Fucking support?

02:05:27.145 --> 02:05:29.397
- You... No, you...
- Oh. What?

02:05:29.522 --> 02:05:30.941
No.

02:05:31.066 --> 02:05:33.068
I didn't assault you.

02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:38.156
You didn't...
You don't call that assault?

02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:40.533
- No?
- No.

02:05:40.659 --> 02:05:42.035
No, you're right.

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.870
It's fucking battery,
as well as kidnapping

02:05:43.995 --> 02:05:47.666
and fucking a million
other felonies, I'm sure.

02:05:47.791 --> 02:05:49.209
Fuck you, dude.

02:05:49.334 --> 02:05:51.419
But, I didn't
assault you.

02:05:52.212 --> 02:05:55.257
I was trying to calm you down,
so you didn't hurt yourself.

02:05:55.382 --> 02:05:57.259
You fucking pinned
me to the ground.

02:05:57.384 --> 02:05:59.135
You tied my fucking hands
behind my back.

02:05:59.261 --> 02:06:00.929
You... you fucking gagged me.

02:06:01.054 --> 02:06:02.472
Have you seen
the fucking bruises

02:06:02.597 --> 02:06:05.433
on my legs and my fucking arms?

02:06:05.558 --> 02:06:07.978
You fucking assaulted me,
you psychopath.

02:06:09.104 --> 02:06:12.941
First, it's because
you have sensitive skin.

02:06:13.066 --> 02:06:14.276
No, it's not.

02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:16.361
It's because
you're fucking crazy.

02:06:16.486 --> 02:06:19.948
And second,
because you're too crazy.

02:06:21.825 --> 02:06:24.661
I mean "crazy, too."

02:06:24.786 --> 02:06:28.540
But I can say
you're too crazy, too.

02:06:30.041 --> 02:06:31.584
It's not funny, yeah.

02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:33.420
Touché.

02:06:34.379 --> 02:06:36.089
"Toosh."

02:06:39.259 --> 02:06:41.928
But, anyway,
you were not in danger

02:06:42.053 --> 02:06:46.641
of injury or harm, right?

02:06:54.941 --> 02:06:56.568
You know,
if Garnik wasn't there,

02:06:56.693 --> 02:06:59.571
you'd have raped me, guaranteed.

02:07:01.906 --> 02:07:03.533
Raped?

02:07:07.704 --> 02:07:09.080
No doubt.

02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:12.917
Why... why would I
have raped you?

02:07:16.504 --> 02:07:18.590
You have rape eyes.

02:07:19.299 --> 02:07:22.510
- Raped eyes?
- Rape eyes.

02:07:24.095 --> 02:07:25.180
You heard me.

02:07:25.305 --> 02:07:27.849
You sick motherfucker
would've raped me.

02:07:31.728 --> 02:07:35.190
Okay, uh, but I didn't want
to raped you.

02:07:37.567 --> 02:07:39.444
Oh, yeah?

02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:42.197
Why?

02:07:44.866 --> 02:07:46.326
What?

02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:49.120
Why?

02:07:49.245 --> 02:07:50.914
What "why?"

02:07:52.123 --> 02:07:54.584
Why wouldn't you have raped me?

02:07:57.921 --> 02:07:59.964
Because I'm...

02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:02.133
not a rapist.

02:08:05.095 --> 02:08:08.723
Nope, 'cause you're
a faggot-ass bitch.

02:08:28.743 --> 02:08:30.245
Here.

02:08:34.249 --> 02:08:35.792
Goodnight.

02:10:17.602 --> 02:10:19.062
Hey.

02:10:54.097 --> 02:10:55.598
Don't tell Toros.

02:11:50.612 --> 02:11:53.197
This car is very you.

02:11:57.327 --> 02:11:58.870
Do you like it?

02:12:04.959 --> 02:12:06.502
No.

02:12:17.472 --> 02:12:19.515
It's my grandmother's.

02:18:35.391 --> 02:18:39.270
