00:32.366 --> 00:35.118
I need a father who's a role model.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.578
Not some horny geek-boy
who's gonna spray his shorts

00:37.746 --> 00:40.164
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.377
What a lame-o.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.842
Someone really should just
put him out of his misery.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.596
Want me to kill him for you?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.940
Yeah. Would you?

01:19.288 --> 01:21.330
My name is Lester Burnham.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.542
This is my neighborhood.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.712
This is my street.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.174
This is my life.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.969
I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year...

01:35.596 --> 01:36.763
...I'll be dead.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.731
Of course, I don't know that yet.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.696
And in a way, I'm dead already.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.042
Look at me.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.877
Jerking off in the shower.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.381
This will be the high point of my day.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.884
It's all downhill from here.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.599
That's my wife, Carolyn.

02:23.352 --> 02:27.563
See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?

02:28.398 --> 02:29.899
That's not an accident.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.236
Hush, Bitsy!

02:33.403 --> 02:35.071
Hush! What is wrong with you?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.240
That's our next door neighbor, Jim.

02:38.242 --> 02:41.077
And that's his lover... Jim.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.703
You spoil her. Bitsy...

02:42.871 --> 02:45.331
- Me?
- ...no bark! Come inside now!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.834
- Come on.
- Good morning, Jim!

02:48.001 --> 02:50.086
Morning, Carolyn.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.298
I love your tie. That color!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.133
I just love your roses.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.886
How do you get them
to flourish like this?

02:59.054 --> 03:02.682
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.725
- I've never heard of that.
- Man...

03:04.893 --> 03:07.436
...I get exhausted just watching her.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.482
She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.736
We used to be happy.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.576
My daughter, Jane. Only child.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.290
Janie's a pretty typical teenager:

03:27.457 --> 03:30.751
angry, insecure, confused.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.797
I wish I could tell her
that's all going to pass

03:34.965 --> 03:36.799
but I don't want to lie to her.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.056
Jane, honey,
are you trying to look unattractive?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.474
Yes.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.269
Congratulations,
you've succeeded admirably.

03:48.437 --> 03:52.857
Lester, could you make me a little
later? I'm not quite late enough.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.487
Nice going, Dad.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.825
Both my wife and daughter
think I'm this gigantic loser.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.827
And they're right.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.457
I have lost something.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.834
I'm not exactly sure what it is,

04:12.002 --> 04:17.505
but I know I didn't always
feel this... sedated.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.927
But you know what?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.347
It's never too late to get it back.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.018
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from Media Monthly magazine.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.020
I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.315
Well, we're all under a deadline here.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.692
There's some information
about your product launch

04:36.860 --> 04:38.986
that isn't even covered
in your press release and...

04:40.864 --> 04:43.115
Yeah, OK. Can I ask you a question?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.451
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.453
'Cause he doesn't
ever seem to come in.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.623
Yeah, OK. I'll leave my number.

04:50.791 --> 04:55.127
It's 555-0199.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.381
Lester Burnham. Thank you.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.509
Hey, Les.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.303
You got a minute?

05:04.471 --> 05:07.139
For you, Brad, I got five.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.685
So I'm sure you can understand

05:10.852 --> 05:12.645
our need to cut corners around here.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.691
Sure. Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.235
You got to spend money
to make money, right?

05:19.403 --> 05:23.072
- Exactly.
- Like the time when Mr. Flournoy

05:23.240 --> 05:26.075
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,

05:26.243 --> 05:29.495
then she used the card and stayed
at the St. Regis for three months...

05:29.663 --> 05:32.748
- That's unsubstantiated gossip!
- That's $50,000!

05:32.916 --> 05:34.750
That's someone's salary
who's gonna get fired

05:34.918 --> 05:36.919
because Craig has to
pay women to fuck him!

05:37.087 --> 05:40.673
Jesus! Calm down.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.591
Nobody's getting fired yet.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.762
That's why we're having everyone
write out a job description

05:46.930 --> 05:49.724
mapping out in detail
how they contribute.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.977
That way management can
assess who's valuable...

05:53.145 --> 05:55.062
And who's expendable.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.315
It's just business.

06:00.277 --> 06:04.280
I've been writing for this magazine
for 14 years. You've been here a month?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.532
I'm one of the good guys, Les.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.452
I'm trying to level with you.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.039
This is your one chance
to save your job.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.501
There's no decision.
Just write the damn thing.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.337
You don't think it's weird
and kind of fascist?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.673
Possibly, but you don't want
to be unemployed.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.760
Let's sell our souls and work for Satan
because it's more convenient.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.804
Could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.640
So we finally got new neighbors.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.811
If the Lomans had let me represent them
instead of the Real Estate King

06:35.979 --> 06:38.314
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.275
They were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.861
Their sycamore? Come on!

06:44.029 --> 06:47.615
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.575
How can you call it their sycamore?

06:49.743 --> 06:54.330
I wouldn't have the heart to cut down
something if it wasn't partially mine.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.719
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.681
No. No, we don't.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.769
As soon as you've prepared a nutritious,
yet savory, meal that I'm about to eat

07:16.937 --> 07:19.063
you can listen to whatever you like.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.986
So, Janie, how was school?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.115
It was OK.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.741
Just OK?

07:31.743 --> 07:35.329
No, Dad. It was spectacular.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.710
Well, you want to know how things
went at my job today?

07:41.878 --> 07:44.296
They've hired this efficiency expert.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.384
This really friendly guy named Brad.
How perfect is that?

07:48.552 --> 07:52.888
He's there to make it seem like
they're justified in firing somebody

07:53.056 --> 07:55.599
because they couldn't just
come right out and say that.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.601
That would just be too honest.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.355
So they've asked us. You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.233
Well, what do you expect?

08:04.401 --> 08:07.903
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.285
I mean, hello! You've barely
even spoken to me for months.

08:20.834 --> 08:25.421
What? You're Mother of the Year?
You treat her like an employee.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.173
What?

08:29.676 --> 08:30.759
What?!

08:33.513 --> 08:35.264
I'm going to get some ice cream.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.940
Janie...

08:46.318 --> 08:49.445
I'm sorry I haven't been more...

08:50.447 --> 08:52.781
...available. I'm just... I...

08:56.036 --> 08:59.121
You know, you don't always have to
wait for me to come to you.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.958
Great. So now it's my fault?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.711
I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.050
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.736
I will sell this house today.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.082
I will sell this house today.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.251
I will sell this house today.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.934
I will sell this house today.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.071
Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.366
This living room is very dramatic.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.202
Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!

11:43.370 --> 11:46.497
A simple cream
could really lighten things up.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.665
You could even put in a skylight.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.629
Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

11:53.797 --> 11:57.091
It's a dream come true for any cook.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.802
Just filled with positive energy.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.724
You'll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.

12:09.145 --> 12:13.816
You know, you could have some really
fun backyard get-togethers out here.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.859
The ad said this pool
was "lagoon-like."

12:16.027 --> 12:19.780
- Nothing "lagoon-like" about it.
- Except for maybe the bugs!

12:19.948 --> 12:21.740
There aren't even any plants out here!

12:21.908 --> 12:24.743
What do you call this?
Is this not this a plant?

12:24.911 --> 12:28.789
If you have a problem with the plants,
I can call my landscape architect.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.708
- Solved!
- I think lagoon, I think waterfall.

12:31.876 --> 12:36.004
I think tropical.
This is a cement hole.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.301
I have some tiki torches in the garage.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.918
Shut up!

13:15.086 --> 13:18.213
Stop it! You weak. You baby! Shut up!

13:18.381 --> 13:20.215
Shut up! Shut up!

14:06.095 --> 14:07.930
Who are you looking for?

14:08.097 --> 14:10.474
My parents are coming tonight.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.977
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.605
Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.109
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?

14:25.782 --> 14:28.450
What makes you so sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask?

14:28.618 --> 14:32.120
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.122
But she's been practicing
her steps for weeks.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.166
I'll bet money she'll resent it.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.544
And I'm missing
the James Bond marathon on TNT.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.796
Lester! This is important!

14:40.964 --> 14:43.632
I'm sensing a real distance
growing between you and Jane.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.552
Growing? She hates me.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.303
She's just willful.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.180
She hates you, too.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.233
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.194
Pardon me. Excuse me.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.322
Now, for your halftime entertainment,

15:07.490 --> 15:11.618
Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!

15:11.786 --> 15:13.954
We can leave right after this, right?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.465
Shit! They're still here.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.970
- Janie!
- Hey, I really enjoyed that!

17:35.138 --> 17:37.973
- Congratulations! You were great!
- I didn't win anything.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.058
Hi, I'm Lester, Janie's dad.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.768
Oh, hi.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.982
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

17:47.150 --> 17:50.444
OK. Good to meet you.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.155
You were also good tonight. Very...

17:54.907 --> 17:57.117
- ...precise.
- Thanks.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.120
Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey!

18:00.288 --> 18:03.248
I am so proud of you! You know,
I watched you very closely.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.208
You didn't screw up once!

18:06.669 --> 18:09.004
OK. We have to go.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.424
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.426
We're going out for pizza.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.095
Really? We can give you a ride.
I have a car. Want to come with us?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.514
Thanks, but I have a car.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.976
You have a car. Well, that's great.
That's great.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.354
'Cause Janie's thinking about
getting a car soon, aren't you?

18:26.522 --> 18:28.690
Dad! Mom's waiting for you.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.404
It was very nice meeting you, Angela.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.741
Any friend of Janie's is...

18:38.910 --> 18:40.535
...a friend of mine.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.041
Well...

18:47.335 --> 18:48.752
...I'll be seeing you around, then.

18:53.424 --> 18:57.135
Could he be any more... pathetic?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.179
I think he's sweet.

19:00.765 --> 19:04.559
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.162
It's the weirdest thing.

19:25.081 --> 19:28.583
I feel like I've been
in a coma for about 20 years

19:28.751 --> 19:31.086
and I'm just now waking up.

20:02.159 --> 20:05.495
Spectacular.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.799
I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.595
That's OK.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.638
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.642
It started when I was about 12.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.896
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.481
Every Thursday night, Red Lobster.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.068
And every guy there
would stare at me when I walked in.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.154
And I knew what they were thinking.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.198
Just like I knew guys at school
thought about me when they jerked off.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.161
- Vomit.
- No, I liked it.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.288
And I still like it.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.999
If people I don't even know
look at me and want to fuck me

20:51.167 --> 20:56.880
it means I really have a shot
at being a model, which is great.

20:57.632 --> 21:01.635
Because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.766
I really think it'll happen for you.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.394
I know.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.689
Because everything
that was meant to happen, does...

21:14.857 --> 21:16.399
...eventually.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.301
Asshole.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.451
Hello?

22:50.828 --> 22:51.995
Hello?

23:08.137 --> 23:10.555
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.307
I didn't.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.018
My phone rang and I answered,
and somebody hung up.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.978
I star-69ed, and I called you back.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.064
Well, I was in the shower.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.779
Oh, gross!

23:41.629 --> 23:43.963
Ricky? Breakfast!

23:46.342 --> 23:48.051
Be right there.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.311
- Mom?
- Hello.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.814
I don't eat bacon, remember?

24:02.942 --> 24:04.400
I'm sorry. I must've forgotten.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.747
What's new in the world, Dad?

24:19.416 --> 24:22.210
This country is going straight to hell.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.554
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.725
No.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.110
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.736
Just something from our garden.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.072
Except the pasta.
We got that at Fallaci's.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.242
It's unbelievably fresh.
Drop it in the water and it's done.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.581
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.083
Colonel Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.753
- Nice to meet you. This is my partner.
- Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.215
Let's cut to the chase, OK?
What are you guys selling?

25:10.926 --> 25:13.344
Nothing. We just wanted to say hi
to our new neighbors.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.597
Yeah, yeah...

25:15.764 --> 25:18.933
You said you're partners,
so what's your business?

25:20.603 --> 25:21.769
Well...

25:22.688 --> 25:24.606
He is a tax attorney.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.608
And he's an anesthesiologist.

25:36.452 --> 25:40.288
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?

25:41.957 --> 25:43.958
How can they be so shameless?

25:46.962 --> 25:48.630
That's the whole thing, Dad.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.257
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.886
Well, it is.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.806
Yeah, you're right.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.684
Don't placate me
like I'm your mother, boy.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.565
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly:

26:07.733 --> 26:10.485
Those fags make me want to puke
my fucking guts out.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.161
Well, me too, Son.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.956
Yeah, me too.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.590
I'm serious. He just pulled down
his pants and yanked it out.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.176
You know, like,
"Say hello to Mr. Happy."

26:35.344 --> 26:38.221
- Gross.
- It wasn't gross.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.182
- It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

26:41.350 --> 26:42.767
Of course I did.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.603
He is a really well-known photographer.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.523
He shoots for Elle
on, like, a regular basis.

26:48.691 --> 26:51.150
It would've been so majorly
stupid of me to turn him down.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.486
You are a total prostitute.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.532
Hey. That's how things really are.

26:57.700 --> 27:01.411
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

27:01.578 --> 27:05.164
So are you. You've only been in
Seventeen once, and you looked fat!

27:05.332 --> 27:09.002
So stop acting like you're
goddamned Christy Turlington!

27:11.505 --> 27:12.839
Cunt!

27:14.717 --> 27:18.177
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.

27:20.431 --> 27:23.599
Oh, my God! That's the pervert
who filmed me last night.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.228
Him? Jane, no way,
he's a total lunatic.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.230
- You know him?
- Yeah.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.733
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade

27:31.900 --> 27:35.069
and he would always say
the most random, weird things.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.906
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.410
And then, Connie Cardullo told me

27:42.578 --> 27:45.538
that his parents had
to put him in a mental institution.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.790
Why? What did he do?

27:48.751 --> 27:49.751
What do you mean?

27:50.669 --> 27:54.922
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.470
You total slut!

28:01.347 --> 28:03.765
- You've got a crush on him!
- What? Please!

28:03.932 --> 28:07.518
You're defending him. You love him.
You want to have 10,000 of his babies.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.937
- Shut up!
- Hi.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.107
My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.234
I know.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.405
I remember this really creepy incident
where you were filming me last night.

28:19.573 --> 28:22.950
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just think you're interesting.

28:23.118 --> 28:28.289
Thanks, but I don't need some psycho
obsessing about me right now.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.502
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.478
What a freak!

28:50.646 --> 28:52.647
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.068
He's, like, so confident.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.654
That can't be real.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.907
I don't believe him.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.285
I mean, he didn't even look at me once.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.543
How'd you get in the Army?

29:13.710 --> 29:16.170
Look, Sergeant, I got
three reasons for being in the Army.

29:16.338 --> 29:20.341
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.721
You two boys report to me
immediately after this formation.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.306
Take them away, Sarge!

29:34.773 --> 29:36.899
Hey.

29:37.067 --> 29:39.652
One, two, three, four.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.696
What's going on here?

29:41.864 --> 29:44.365
Bend all the way down.
Here comes the bull of the woods.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.077
I'm sorry, what?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.165
Mom, nobody said anything.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.876
Oh. I'm sorry.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.219
Everyone's with their spouse. How'd
it look if I showed up with no one?

30:05.387 --> 30:08.347
- You end up ignoring me and talking...
- Now listen to me.

30:08.515 --> 30:10.141
This is an important business function.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.394
As you know,
my business is selling an image

30:13.562 --> 30:16.105
and part of my job
is to live that image...

30:16.273 --> 30:17.732
Honey, do me a favor.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.526
Just say whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.196
All right. Hi, Shirley!

30:25.073 --> 30:27.825
Listen, just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.745
- I am happy, honey.
- No, you're not.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.705
Oh! That's Buddy!

30:32.873 --> 30:35.249
Buddy. Buddy!

30:35.417 --> 30:38.920
- Hi.
- Hi! Good to see you again.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.839
It's so good to see you, too, Catherine.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.426
- Carolyn.
- Carolyn, of course. How are you?

30:45.594 --> 30:47.386
Very well, thank you.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.472
- Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.601
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.437
We've met before, actually.
This thing last year.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.233
- Christmas at the Sheraton.
- Oh, yeah.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.694
It's OK. I wouldn't remember me, either.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.243
Honey, don't be weird!

31:11.203 --> 31:13.746
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- OK.

31:13.914 --> 31:18.209
- I'll be whatever you want me to be.
- Well, OK...

31:29.596 --> 31:32.848
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.480
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.447
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.506
Excuse me.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.719
Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail?
The house with the red door?

32:10.345 --> 32:11.345
Yeah.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.724
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
in the house next to you.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.020
Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.689
Hi, Mr. Burnham.

32:31.908 --> 32:32.908
Do you party?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.371
- Excuse me?
- Do you get high?

32:41.126 --> 32:44.378
I probably wouldn't even tell you this
if I weren't a little tipsy

32:44.546 --> 32:49.216
but... I'm in complete awe of you.

32:50.510 --> 32:56.390
I mean, your firm is hands down the
Rolls Royce of local real estate firms

32:56.558 --> 32:59.727
and your personal sales record is...

33:02.147 --> 33:04.190
It's very intimidating.

33:05.067 --> 33:09.487
You know, I'd love to sit down with you
and just pick your brain.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.697
If you'd ever be willing.

33:14.159 --> 33:17.536
You know? I suppose, technically,
I'm the competition

33:17.704 --> 33:21.415
but, I mean, I don't flatter myself

33:21.583 --> 33:24.377
that I'm even in the same league as you.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.253
I don't.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.714
I'd love to.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.719
- Really?
- Absolutely.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.847
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.851
I'll do that. Thank you.

33:47.776 --> 33:52.363
Did you see that movie where the body
is walking around carrying its own head

33:52.531 --> 33:55.199
and then the head
goes down on that babe?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.660
Re-Animator.

34:00.831 --> 34:05.126
Look, I'm not paying you to do
whatever it is you're doing out here.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.129
Fine. So don't pay me.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.924
- Excuse me?
- I quit.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.344
So you don't have to pay me.
Now leave me alone.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.223
Asshole.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.688
I think you just became
my personal hero.

34:27.815 --> 34:31.068
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

34:32.987 --> 34:35.656
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...

34:35.824 --> 34:37.533
Eighteen.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.661
I just do these gigs as a cover.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.456
I have other sources of income.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.208
But my dad interferes less in my life

34:46.376 --> 34:49.962
when I pretend to be an upstanding
young citizen with a respectable job.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.880
Lester?!

34:55.010 --> 34:56.177
What are you doing?

34:56.344 --> 34:59.555
Honey, this... Ricky Fitts.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.142
This is Ricky Fitts.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.689
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.566
I go to school with your daughter.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.861
With Jane?

35:14.029 --> 35:16.030
- Yeah. Jane.
- Really?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.950
Hi. I'm ready to go.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.702
I'll meet you out front.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.043
I'm in trouble!

35:31.213 --> 35:34.215
Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts.
Thanks for the... thing.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.050
Anytime. Lester!

35:37.677 --> 35:40.012
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.572
Shit. They're home.
Quick, let's go up to my room.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.491
I should say hi to your dad.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.244
I don't want to be rude.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.299
Nice suit.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.512
You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.723
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.230
Is that root beer?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.875
I love root beer, don't you?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.463
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.632
You remember Angela?

37:39.799 --> 37:41.759
Yes, of course.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.303
I forgot to tell you, she's gonna
spend the night. Is that OK?

37:53.647 --> 37:55.272
Sorry about my dad.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.191
Don't be. I think it's funny.

37:58.318 --> 38:02.363
Yeah, to you, he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

38:02.530 --> 38:07.201
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.414
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.458
But your dad's actually kind of cute.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.960
Shut up.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.630
He is. If he just worked out
a little, he'd be hot.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.799
- Shut up!
- Come on!

38:21.967 --> 38:24.385
Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear?

38:24.552 --> 38:26.345
I bet he's got a big dick.

38:26.513 --> 38:29.056
You are so grossing me out right now!

38:29.224 --> 38:32.351
If he built up his chest and arms,
I would totally fuck him!

38:32.519 --> 38:36.814
I would! I would suck
on your dad's big, fat dick

38:36.982 --> 38:40.484
and then I'd fuck him
until his eyes rolled back in his head!

38:40.652 --> 38:42.736
Jane! What's that noise?

38:46.408 --> 38:49.034
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.829
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

38:51.997 --> 38:55.666
No, I'm serious. See?

38:58.461 --> 39:00.754
- Oh, my God, Jane.
- What is it?

39:04.592 --> 39:09.138
It's that psycho next door.
Jane, what if he worships you?

39:09.723 --> 39:12.349
What if he's got, like,
a shrine with pictures of you

39:12.517 --> 39:14.852
surrounded by
dead people's heads and stuff?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.938
Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.274
Really?

40:51.741 --> 40:54.535
Welcome to America's
Weirdest Home Videos.

41:21.229 --> 41:24.022
- Ricky?
- Coming, Dad.

41:25.400 --> 41:29.611
You know I don't like locked doors
in my house, boy.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.827
I'm sorry. I must've locked it
by accident.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.080
So, what's up?

41:43.668 --> 41:45.919
I need a urine sample.

41:47.297 --> 41:50.507
Wow. It's been six months already.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.261
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.763
Yeah, I suppose.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.603
You know...

42:10.695 --> 42:14.072
Well... Good night, Son.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.016
I've been waiting for you.

43:43.997 --> 43:46.164
You've been working out, haven't you?

43:46.332 --> 43:48.041
I could tell.

43:50.295 --> 43:52.379
I was hoping you'd give me a bath.

43:52.547 --> 43:55.507
I'm very, very dirty.

44:28.958 --> 44:30.876
What are you doing?

44:32.462 --> 44:33.795
Nothing.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.423
You were masturbating.

44:36.591 --> 44:38.717
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

44:40.386 --> 44:43.096
All right, so shoot me!
I was whacking off.

44:44.057 --> 44:47.601
That's right, I was choking the bishop.
Chafing the carrot.

44:47.769 --> 44:50.604
You know, saying hi to my monster.

44:50.772 --> 44:53.690
- That's disgusting!
- Excuse me,

44:53.858 --> 44:56.735
but some of us still have blood
pumping through our veins!

44:56.903 --> 44:58.612
- So do I!
- Really?

44:58.780 --> 45:01.490
I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it!

45:04.160 --> 45:06.661
Lester, I refuse to live like this.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.205
This is not a marriage!

45:08.373 --> 45:11.458
This hasn't been a marriage for years.

45:11.626 --> 45:14.169
But you were happy
as long as I kept my mouth shut.

45:14.337 --> 45:19.132
Guess what? I've changed. And the
new me whacks off when he feels horny,

45:19.300 --> 45:22.094
'cause you're obviously not gonna
help me out in that department.

45:22.261 --> 45:24.805
I see. You think you're the only one
who's sexually frustrated.

45:24.972 --> 45:28.058
I'm not? Well,
then come on, baby, I'm ready!

45:28.226 --> 45:30.185
Don't you mess with me, mister.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.480
I will divorce you so fast
it'll make your head spin!

45:33.648 --> 45:35.732
On what grounds?

45:35.900 --> 45:38.485
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

45:38.653 --> 45:40.695
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.657
I don't even try to touch you
since you made it abundantly clear

45:43.825 --> 45:45.992
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

45:48.329 --> 45:51.331
But I did support you
when you got your license.

45:51.499 --> 45:55.001
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

45:57.880 --> 46:01.675
So turn out the light
when you come back to bed, OK?

46:14.313 --> 46:16.022
It's a great thing when you realize

46:16.190 --> 46:19.025
you still have the ability
to surprise yourself.

46:20.736 --> 46:24.281
Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.

46:24.782 --> 46:25.782
Hey, guys!

46:25.950 --> 46:29.369
- Lester, I didn't know you ran.
- I just started.

46:29.537 --> 46:30.704
Good for you.

46:30.872 --> 46:34.833
I figured you might be able to give me
some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.

46:35.001 --> 46:37.169
Are you looking to just lose weight

46:37.336 --> 46:40.755
or do you want to have increased
strength and flexibility as well?

46:42.216 --> 46:44.050
I want to look good naked.

46:59.692 --> 47:00.984
What is this?

47:01.152 --> 47:03.904
Fucking gay pride parade?

47:04.947 --> 47:06.907
Hey, Ricky.

47:09.660 --> 47:14.247
My life is passing before my eyes and
those two have barely broken a sweat.

47:14.415 --> 47:17.667
Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.669
Colonel Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps.

47:19.837 --> 47:22.255
Oh, well...

47:23.216 --> 47:25.133
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.680
Ricky...

47:32.350 --> 47:36.061
I was thinking about...
the movie we talked about.

47:36.229 --> 47:37.687
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.981
You want to borrow it?
It's up in my room.

47:40.149 --> 47:41.733
- OK.
- Come on.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.621
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

47:54.789 --> 47:57.749
I don't think my dad would come in
while someone else is here,

47:57.917 --> 48:00.585
- but you never know.
- What is this?

48:00.753 --> 48:02.671
Urine.

48:02.838 --> 48:06.341
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.095
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

48:10.263 --> 48:12.305
It's not mine.

48:12.473 --> 48:16.017
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

48:16.185 --> 48:19.229
I cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

48:22.108 --> 48:23.775
You like Pink Floyd?

48:25.444 --> 48:27.070
I like a lot of music.

48:28.990 --> 48:31.992
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.161
How much do you want?

48:35.997 --> 48:39.833
I don't know. It's been a while.
How much is an ounce?

48:43.796 --> 48:46.548
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

48:49.677 --> 48:52.345
This shit is top-of-the-line.

48:52.513 --> 48:55.849
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the US government.

48:56.017 --> 48:59.894
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.898
Is that what we smoked last night?

49:04.859 --> 49:06.651
This is all I ever smoke.

49:10.615 --> 49:14.075
- How much?
- Two grand.

49:14.243 --> 49:16.202
Jesus!

49:16.370 --> 49:19.331
Things have changed since 1973.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.875
You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.

49:22.043 --> 49:23.043
Thanks.

49:23.210 --> 49:25.462
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

49:25.630 --> 49:27.672
Beep me any time, day or night.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.217
And I only accept cash.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.429
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

49:36.432 --> 49:40.060
When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an 8-track.

49:40.227 --> 49:41.728
That sucks.

49:41.896 --> 49:44.314
No. Actually, it was great.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.193
All I did was party and get laid.

49:50.446 --> 49:52.614
I had my whole life ahead of me.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.244
My dad thinks I pay for all this
with catering jobs.

50:00.081 --> 50:02.374
Never underestimate the power of denial.

50:36.492 --> 50:38.702
What the hell do you think you're doing?

50:41.288 --> 50:43.957
Mom's mad. Bench presses.

50:45.084 --> 50:48.420
I'm going to whale on my pecs,
and then I'm going to do my back.

50:49.338 --> 50:53.633
I see you're smoking pot now.
I'm so glad.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.969
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances

50:56.137 --> 50:58.763
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

50:58.931 --> 51:03.059
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

51:05.438 --> 51:08.440
Lester, you have such hostility in you!

51:08.607 --> 51:11.151
Do you mind?
I'm trying to work out here.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.777
Unless you want to spot me.

51:12.945 --> 51:18.658
Lester, you will not get away with this!
You can be sure of that!

51:20.494 --> 51:23.246
That's... what...

51:23.414 --> 51:25.290
...you... think.

51:26.125 --> 51:30.336
"My job consists
of basically masking my contempt

51:30.504 --> 51:32.922
for the assholes in charge

51:33.090 --> 51:35.341
and, at least once a day,

51:35.509 --> 51:39.012
retiring to the men's room
so I can jerk off

51:39.847 --> 51:44.601
while I fantasize about a life
that doesn't so closely resemble hell."

51:45.352 --> 51:48.980
Well, you obviously have
no interest in saving yourself.

51:49.148 --> 51:53.401
Brad, for 14 years I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.988
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

51:57.156 --> 52:00.366
Whatever. Management wants you gone
by the end of the day.

52:00.534 --> 52:04.037
What sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me

52:04.205 --> 52:07.165
considering the information I have
about our editorial director

52:07.333 --> 52:11.044
buying pussy with company money?
Which I think would interest the IRS,

52:11.212 --> 52:13.379
since it technically constitutes fraud.

52:13.547 --> 52:16.800
I'm sure that some of our advertisers
and rival publications

52:16.967 --> 52:20.929
might like to know about it as well.
Not to mention... Craig's wife.

52:23.140 --> 52:27.310
- What do you want?
- One year's salary with benefits.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.229
That's not going to happen.

52:30.689 --> 52:33.942
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

52:37.029 --> 52:39.739
- Against who?
- Against you.

52:40.574 --> 52:43.326
Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job

52:43.494 --> 52:45.912
if I let you blow me?

52:50.960 --> 52:54.420
Man... You are one twisted fuck.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.257
Nope.

52:57.424 --> 53:00.844
I'm just an ordinary guy
with nothing to lose.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.142
Yeah!

53:14.358 --> 53:16.943
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

53:17.111 --> 53:18.945
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.616
Christy left for New York this morning.

53:23.784 --> 53:27.203
Let's just say things were
a little hectic around the house.

53:27.371 --> 53:29.080
What's she doing in New York?

53:29.248 --> 53:32.917
She's moving there.
Yes. We are splitting up.

53:33.878 --> 53:37.338
- Buddy, I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

53:37.506 --> 53:41.426
According to her,
I'm too focused on my career.

53:42.553 --> 53:47.557
As if being driven to succeed
is some sort of a character flaw.

53:48.434 --> 53:52.812
She certainly did take advantage of
the lifestyle my success afforded her.

53:57.192 --> 53:58.902
It's for the best.

54:01.238 --> 54:04.490
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

54:04.658 --> 54:06.409
Call me crazy...

54:07.494 --> 54:12.081
...but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

54:12.249 --> 54:16.419
one must project an image
of success at all times.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.274
What are you doing?

54:39.693 --> 54:41.361
I was filming this dead bird.

54:41.528 --> 54:42.946
Why?

54:43.113 --> 54:44.864
Because it's beautiful.

54:47.910 --> 54:50.995
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental-boy.

54:53.457 --> 54:54.707
Hi, Jane.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.919
Look, I want you to stop filming me.

55:00.214 --> 55:01.714
OK.

55:01.882 --> 55:04.342
Well, whatever. This is boring.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.010
Let's go.

55:07.304 --> 55:10.640
- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?

55:10.808 --> 55:13.977
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a dumpster somewhere.

55:14.144 --> 55:17.522
It's OK. I'll walk. But thanks.

55:17.690 --> 55:19.941
See? He doesn't want to go anyway.
Come on. Let's go.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.444
Come on, Jane.

55:23.612 --> 55:25.029
I think I'm gonna walk, too.

55:26.365 --> 55:30.785
What? Jane, that's,
like, almost a mile!

55:46.760 --> 55:49.303
God! I love it!

55:49.805 --> 55:53.141
- You like getting nailed by the king?
- Yes, I love it!

55:53.308 --> 55:55.977
Fuck me, Your Majesty!

55:56.145 --> 55:57.478
- Who's the king?
- You are!

55:57.646 --> 55:59.063
Who's the king?

56:15.497 --> 56:17.623
American woman

56:17.791 --> 56:20.293
Stay away from me

56:20.461 --> 56:22.628
American woman

56:22.796 --> 56:25.590
Mama let me be

56:26.967 --> 56:29.135
Don't come hanging around my door

56:29.303 --> 56:31.971
I don't wanna see your face no more

56:32.139 --> 56:36.684
I got better things to do
Than spend my life growing old with you

56:36.852 --> 56:38.686
Now woman

56:38.854 --> 56:41.481
♪ I said, "Stay away"

56:41.648 --> 56:45.943
- Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's.
- What?

56:46.111 --> 56:48.446
Would you like to try
our new bacon and egg fajita,

56:48.614 --> 56:51.324
just $1 .29 for a limited time only?

56:51.492 --> 56:53.367
No, but thank you.

56:53.535 --> 56:57.330
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries, and an orange soda.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.582
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.

57:01.835 --> 57:04.504
Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be $4.98, please.

57:07.966 --> 57:10.301
- Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
- No, no.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.762
Actually, I'd like
to fill out an application.

57:12.930 --> 57:15.264
There's no jobs for manager.
It's just for counter.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.933
Good.

57:17.101 --> 57:21.270
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.359
I don't think you'd fit in here.

57:26.527 --> 57:29.737
I have fast-food experience.

57:29.905 --> 57:31.948
Yeah, like 20 years ago!

57:32.116 --> 57:36.035
I'm sure there have been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

57:36.203 --> 57:38.704
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.582
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

57:45.921 --> 57:48.631
That was exactly what I needed.

57:52.136 --> 57:54.595
The royal treatment, so to speak.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.350
I was so stressed out.

58:07.526 --> 58:10.236
- Know what I do when I feel like that?
- What?

58:12.239 --> 58:14.282
I fire a gun.

58:14.449 --> 58:15.616
Really?

58:15.784 --> 58:17.702
Yeah, I go to this little
firing range downtown

58:17.870 --> 58:21.038
and I just pop off a few rounds.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.417
I've never fired a gun before.

58:24.585 --> 58:26.252
Well, you've got to try it.

58:26.420 --> 58:28.462
Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

58:31.425 --> 58:35.136
Well, almost nothing.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.602
So, do you like your new house?

58:42.769 --> 58:43.978
I like it.

58:44.146 --> 58:47.356
The people who used to live there fed
stray cats, so they were always around,

58:47.524 --> 58:50.443
and it drove my mother nuts.

58:50.611 --> 58:52.737
And then she cut down their tree.

58:54.448 --> 58:57.241
- Is that a funeral?
- Yeah.

58:58.327 --> 59:00.828
Have you ever known
anybody who died?

59:00.996 --> 59:02.955
No. Have you?

59:03.123 --> 59:04.916
No.

59:06.126 --> 59:08.836
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once.

59:09.004 --> 59:12.798
Just lying there on the sidewalk.
She looked really sad.

59:27.022 --> 59:29.815
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.026
Why would you film that?

59:32.194 --> 59:33.945
Because it was amazing.

59:34.112 --> 59:36.072
What's amazing about it?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.241
When you see something like that

59:38.408 --> 59:41.327
it's like God is looking right at you,
just for a second.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.956
And if you're careful,
you can look right back.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.749
And what do you see?

59:48.085 --> 59:49.669
Beauty.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.521
Mom? I want you to meet somebody.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:15.695
- Mom?
- Yes.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:21.200
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:24.495
- Hi.
- Oh, my.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.456
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.969
This is where my dad hides out.

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:43.055
I take it he's got a thing for guns.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.517
You got to see this one thing.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.063
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:54.150
Did you steal his keys?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.069
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.822
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:15.963
Turn it over.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.677
Oh, my God.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:24.805
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:28.476
There's a whole subculture of people
who collect this Nazi shit.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.729
But my dad just has this one thing.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.119
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.166
- No, you're scared of me.
- No, I'm not.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:56.420
You want to see the most beautiful thing
I've ever filmed?

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:23.322
It was one of those days

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:26.325
where it's a minute away from snowing...

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.996
...and there's this electricity
in the air.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.709
You can almost hear it.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.170
Right?

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.218
And this bag was just...

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.597
...dancing with me.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:53.769
Like a little kid,
begging me to play with it.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.357
For 15 minutes.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.738
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.535
...entire life behind things...

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.542
...and this incredibly benevolent force

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.588
that wanted me to know that
there was no reason to be afraid...

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.050
...ever.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.389
Video's a poor excuse, I know.

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.186
But it helps me remember.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.192
I need to remember.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.701
Sometimes there is so much...

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:56.081
...beauty... in the world.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.961
I feel like I can't take it.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.426
And my heart...

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:12.139
...is just going to cave in.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.231
Oh, my God. What time is it?

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:13.033
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's quite all right, dear.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.328
Your father and I were just
discussing his day at work.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.497
Why don't you tell our daughter
about it, honey?

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:22.585
Janie, today I quit my job.
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.671
and blackmailed him for almost $60,000.
Pass the asparagus.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.091
Your father seems to think this kind
of behavior is something to be proud of.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.136
Your mother seems to prefer
I go through life like a prisoner

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:34.263
while she keeps my dick
in a jar under the sink.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.890
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.518
I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.187
on the same day
that you lose your job!

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:45.107
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Where'd my job go?" I quit!

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.610
Someone pass the asparagus, please.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.029
Thank you for putting me
under the added pressure

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:52.781
- of being the sole breadwinner now.
- I already have a job.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.534
Don't give a second thought
as to who's gonna pay the mortgage.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.286
We'll just leave it all to Carolyn!

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.371
"You're gonna take care of everything?"

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:00.789
"Yes, I don't mind."

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:04.043
"You mean everything? You don't mind
having the sole responsibility?

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.128
Your husband feels he
can quit his job..."

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.380
Will someone pass
the fucking asparagus?

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:11.216
- I'm not gonna be a part of this.
- Sit down!

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:34.740
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.993
You two do whatever you want to do
whenever you want,

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.912
and I don't complain. All I want...

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.581
You don't complain?
Please! Excuse me, excuse me!

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:45.334
I must be psychotic!
If you don't complain, what is this?

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.920
Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.673
and see how loud it gets on that one!
You don't...

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.851
Don't interrupt me, honey.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.826
And another thing.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.453
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:24.123
because, frankly,
and I don't think I'm alone here,

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.875
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:37.886
Go away!

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.472
Honey, please let me in.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:54.737
I wish that you hadn't witnessed that
awful scene, but in a way, I'm glad.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.489
Why? So I can see
what freaks you and Dad really are?

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.117
Me?

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:04.663
Oh, God.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.666
Christ, Mom.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:10.753
No, I'm glad because...

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:17.134
Because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:22.639
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.022
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.234
You know, it's sad but true.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.362
And the sooner you learn it, the better.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:41.492
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here, OK?

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.328
You ungrateful little brat!

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.538
Just look at everything you have!

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.167
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.211
We didn't even have our own house.

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.919
You little bastard!

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.838
- No, I just...
- How did you get in there?

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.798
How? How?

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.011
Come on, get up! Come on!

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:07.971
Get up!

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.015
Fight back, you little pussy!

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.850
No, sir, I won't fight you!

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:15.854
- How?! How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:19.650
What were you looking for? Money?
Are you on dope again?

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.986
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:27.616
- A girlfriend?
- Yes, sir. She lives next door.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.631
Her name's Jane.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.278
This is for your own good, boy.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:13.286
You have no respect for other people's
things and for authority.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:14.746
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:19.042
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like!

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:23.171
- You can't! There are rules in life.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:29.261
You need structure, yeah.

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:31.680
- You need discipline!
- Discipline. Yes, sir.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.933
Thank you for trying to teach me.
Don't give up on me, Dad.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.940
Ricky...

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.656
You stay out of there!

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:42.167
I gotta say, when you first came here,
I thought you would be hopeless.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.543
But you're a natural.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:47.089
Well, all I know is,
I love shooting this gun!

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:52.302
Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.555
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:59.684
Don't bring around the cloud
to rain on my parade

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:06.149
♪ I'm gonna march my band out

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:08.860
I'll beat my drum

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:12.197
And if I'm found out

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.283
Your turn at bat, sir

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.036
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:20.038
So what? I didn't make it

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:24.543
Nobody

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.964
I said nobody

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.884
Nobody

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:37.597
Had better rain on

01:14:37.765 --> 01:14:42.853
My parade

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:01.913
What?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.791
Whose car is that out front?

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.752
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.422
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:13.049
- I rule.
- Where's the Camry?

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.260
I traded it in.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.637
Shouldn't you have consulted me first?

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:19.764
Let me think.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.975
No. You never drove it.

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:26.771
Have you done something different?
You look great.

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:33.820
Where's Jane?

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.281
Jane not home.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.539
We have...

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.544
...the whole house...

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.631
...to ourselves.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:57.093
Christ, Carolyn.

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.804
When did you become so...

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:04.017
...joyless?

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:07.854
Joyless?

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.689
I am not joyless.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.984
There happens to be a lot about me

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:16.112
that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:20.158
There is plenty of joy in my life.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.955
Whatever happened to that girl...

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:32.879
...who used to fake seizures
at frat parties when she got bored?

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:39.344
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:42.180
to flash the traffic helicopters?

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.309
Have you totally forgotten about her?

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.895
Because I haven't.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.661
Lester, you're gonna
spill beer on the couch.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.337
So what? It's just a couch.

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:21.386
This is a $4,000 sofa
upholstered in Italian silk!

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.054
This is not just a couch!

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:26.891
It's just a couch!

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:29.227
This isn't life!

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:31.396
This is just stuff.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:36.109
And it's become more important to you
than living. Honey, that's just nuts.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.996
I'm only trying to help you!

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.129
Don't.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.630
Why?

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:05.930
It's weird watching myself.
I don't like how I look.

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.519
Can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:14.773
Look, I'm not gonna
sit here for that shit.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:27.702
How does it feel now?

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:30.955
- Fine.
- You don't feel naked?

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.084
I am naked.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.419
You know what I mean.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.473
So tell me about being in the hospital.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:56.147
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:59.734
He totally freaked and
decided to send me to military school.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:05.031
I told you his thing
about structure and discipline, right?

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:08.326
Well, of course, I got kicked out.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.246
Dad and I had this huge fight.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.748
He hit me.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:18.503
And the next day at school,
some kid made a crack about my haircut.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:22.215
And I just snapped.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:28.096
I wanted to kill him.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.933
I would've killed him...

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.146
...if they hadn't pulled me off.

01:19:39.859 --> 01:19:43.319
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:46.865
They drugged me up and
left me in there for two years.

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:53.455
You must really hate him.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.502
He's not a bad man.

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:03.465
You'd better believe I'd hate my dad
if he did something like that to me.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:07.719
Wait. I already do hate my dad.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.264
Why?

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.227
He's a total asshole.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:20.315
He's got this crush on my friend Angela,
and it's disgusting.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.692
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:26.196
Gross. No.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:33.244
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.960
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.590
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.134
How?

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:51.679
Well, now, I, too, need structure.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.806
A little fucking discipline.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:07.028
I'm serious, though.

01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:10.406
How could he not be damaging me?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.787
I need a father who's a role model.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:18.289
Not some horny geek-boy
who's gonna spray his shorts

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:21.125
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.129
What a lame-o.

01:21:28.259 --> 01:21:31.261
Someone really should just
put him out of his misery.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.808
Want me to kill him for you?

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:48.278
Yeah. Would you?

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:51.948
It'll cost you.

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.492
I've been babysitting
since I was about ten.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.453
I've got almost $3,000.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.667
Course, I was saving it up
for a boob job.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:06.629
But...

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:22.520
You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:27.817
Hiring someone to kill your dad.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.865
I guess I'm not
a very nice girl, then, am I?

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.725
You know I'm not serious, right?

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:03.686
Of course.

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.995
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.128
Remember those posters that said:

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:32.548
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life"?

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:37.470
Well, that's true
of every day except one:

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:40.390
The day you die.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.597
Jane, hurry up.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.225
I've got a very important appointment.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.019
Mom, is it OK
if Angela sleeps over tonight?

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:29.313
Well, of course. She's always welcome.

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:33.276
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.494
- What?
- I've been too embarrassed

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.997
to bring her over.

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:48.833
Because of you
and that way you behave.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.669
What are you talking about?
I've barely even spoken to her.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:55.089
You stare at her all the time!
Like you're drunk!

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:57.175
- It's disgusting!
- Watch yourself, Jane,

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.553
or you're gonna turn into
a real bitch, just like your mother!

01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:06.350
Fuck.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.943
You ready to go?

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:20.948
I don't need a ride.
I'm going in with Jane and her mom.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.541
Oh, morning.

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:35.421
- Hey, Ricky. How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.006
Hey, hey.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:59.213
I need that Super Smiley
with cheese ASAP!

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:01.632
You need more than that,
my little hombre.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.094
- Yeah. What's good here?
- Nothing!

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:08.347
Then I guess we'll
just have to be bad, won't we?

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.809
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.270
- curly fries and a vanilla shake.
- Make that two!

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:17.356
That'll be $7.98. Please drive up
to the window. Thank you.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:22.820
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

01:27:24.615 --> 01:27:27.158
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.953
Smile! You're at Mister Smiley's!

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:35.917
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.294
Just $1 .99 for a limited time only?

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:40.838
We were just at a seminar.

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:43.341
- Buddy, this is my...
- Her husband.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.259
We've met before,

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:49.388
but something tells me you're going
to remember me this time.

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:53.517
You are so busted.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.645
This really doesn't concern you!

01:27:55.812 --> 01:28:00.441
Actually, Janine is senior drive-thru
manager, so you kind of are on her turf.

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:07.198
So, this makes sense.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:09.825
- Oh, Lester...
- Honey, it's OK.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:11.953
I want you to be happy.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.164
- Would you like Smiley sauce with that?
- Lester, just stop it!

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:17.208
No, no. You...

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:21.003
...don't get to tell me what to do...

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:23.255
...ever... again.

01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:39.188
I'm sorry.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:43.275
I guess we should cool it for a while.

01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:48.990
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.909
No. I understand completely.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.205
In order to be successful,

01:28:56.373 --> 01:28:59.041
one must project an image
of success at all times.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.903
Stop it. Stop it.

01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:10.321
Shit.

01:30:17.329 --> 01:30:19.413
I have to run next door.

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:22.666
Jane left her geometry book in my bag.
She needs it to do her homework.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:37.598
You and psycho-boy are fucking
on a regular basis now, right?

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:41.018
- No.
- Come on, you can tell me.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:42.186
Does he have a big dick?

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:46.732
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, OK? It's not like that.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.443
Not like what? Doesn't he have one?

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:52.196
Why don't you want to talk about it?

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.865
I tell you every single detail
about every guy that I fuck.

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:58.077
Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't,
all right?

01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:00.496
Maybe I really don't want
to hear about all that.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:03.999
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're above it?

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:07.211
We got to get you a real man.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:30.401
- You got any papers?
- Yeah.

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:32.403
In the cigar box right over there.

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:34.989
Put up a fight, dude.
You are such a pushover.

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.907
"No, I can't, really, no. OK."

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:39.410
You should learn to roll a joint.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.101
- Hi.
- Where's Mom?

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:49.480
- Don't know.
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:53.317
- Hi.
- Wow. Look at you.

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.820
- Have you been working out?
- Some.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.953
You can really tell.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.666
Look at those arms.

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:15.339
You like muscles?

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.761
I should probably go see
what Jane's up to.

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.150
Where did you get that?

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.779
From my job.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:40.906
You don't lie to me.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:44.576
Now, I saw you with him.

01:33:46.413 --> 01:33:48.372
You were watching me?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.834
What did he make you do?

01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.172
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.216
Don't you laugh at me!

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:05.389
Now, I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cocksucker!

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:06.932
Jesus! What is it with you?

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:15.357
I swear to God I'll throw you out of
this house and never look at you again!

01:34:15.525 --> 01:34:19.486
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:23.073
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fucking faggot!

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.337
You're right.

01:34:40.467 --> 01:34:43.218
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start!

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:45.888
$2,000. I'm that good.

01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:47.181
Get out!

01:34:47.349 --> 01:34:49.516
And you should see me fuck!

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.727
I'm the best piece of ass
in three states!

01:34:51.895 --> 01:34:55.606
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again!

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:05.407
What a sad old man you are.

01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:09.495
Get out.

01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.188
Mom...

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:40.234
- I'm leaving.
- OK.

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:45.239
Wear a raincoat.

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:55.207
I wish things would have
been better for you.

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:01.255
Take care of Dad.

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.706
...disinvesting problems of power

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:38.709
and removing their ability
to make us afraid.

01:36:38.877 --> 01:36:42.087
This is the secret
to "Me-Centered Living."

01:36:42.255 --> 01:36:47.217
Only by taking full responsibility
for your actions and their solutions

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:51.472
will you ever break free from
the constant cycle of victimhood.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:56.810
You are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim. We all have the power...

01:36:56.978 --> 01:37:01.523
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
You're way too uptight about sex.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:05.027
Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

01:37:05.195 --> 01:37:07.112
- Please?
- Why not?

01:37:08.615 --> 01:37:11.658
- Dad, leave us alone!
- It's me.

01:37:13.578 --> 01:37:15.662
If I had to leave tonight,
would you come with me?

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.415
- What?
- If I had to go to New York to live,

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.250
tonight, would you come with me?

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:25.881
- Yes.
- You guys can't be serious!

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:28.425
You're just a kid,
and he's, like, a mental case.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:30.844
You'll end up living in a box
on the street.

01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:34.765
I'm no more a kid than you are!
We can use my plastic surgery money.

01:37:34.933 --> 01:37:37.559
We won't have to.
I have over $40,000.

01:37:37.727 --> 01:37:39.603
I know people in the city
that can help us.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:42.022
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.441
Jane, you'd be out of your mind
to go with him.

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:47.402
- Why do you even care?
- Because you're my friend!

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:51.365
She's not your friend. She's someone
you use to feel better about yourself.

01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:54.785
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Shut up, bitch!

01:37:54.953 --> 01:37:57.829
- Jane! He's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

01:37:57.997 --> 01:38:01.458
And we'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people.

01:38:01.626 --> 01:38:05.295
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just too perfect!

01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:09.675
Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

01:38:11.970 --> 01:38:13.679
Yes, you are.

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:17.182
And you're boring.
And you're totally ordinary.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:20.227
And you know it.

01:38:22.397 --> 01:38:24.565
You two deserve each other.

01:39:25.418 --> 01:39:27.210
Jesus, man, you're soaked!

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:40.724
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:45.270
Are you OK?

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:47.564
Where's your wife?

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:51.318
I don't know.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:54.488
Probably out fucking that dorky
prince-of-real-estate asshole.

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.200
And you know what?

01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:01.203
I don't care.

01:40:11.798 --> 01:40:15.926
Your wife is with another man
and you don't care?

01:40:19.097 --> 01:40:20.430
Nope.

01:40:20.598 --> 01:40:23.266
Our marriage is just for show.

01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:27.479
A commercial for how normal we are

01:40:27.647 --> 01:40:29.606
when we're anything but.

01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:39.449
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

01:40:40.118 --> 01:40:42.953
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

01:40:43.121 --> 01:40:44.621
Yeah.

01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:48.291
It's OK.

01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:53.797
I am...

01:40:55.633 --> 01:40:57.801
You just tell me what you need.

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.765
It's OK.

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:26.955
I'm sorry.

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.041
You got the wrong idea.

01:42:07.288 --> 01:42:09.748
"I refuse to be a victim."

01:42:09.916 --> 01:42:13.835
When this becomes your mantra,
constantly reinforcing your...

01:42:17.924 --> 01:42:21.092
I refuse to be a victim!

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.681
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:09.683
Not at all.

01:43:11.477 --> 01:43:13.478
Bad night?

01:43:13.646 --> 01:43:14.980
Not really bad. Just...

01:43:16.482 --> 01:43:18.441
...strange.

01:43:18.609 --> 01:43:22.779
Believe me, it couldn't possibly
be any stranger than mine.

01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:33.290
Jane and I had a fight.

01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:36.626
It was about you.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:41.006
She's mad at me because...

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.634
...I said I think you're sexy.

01:43:47.847 --> 01:43:51.349
- Do you want a sip?
- Sure.

01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:21.880
So...

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.217
...are you going to tell me?

01:44:29.639 --> 01:44:31.514
What do you want?

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.686
I don't know.

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.190
You...

01:44:40.816 --> 01:44:42.317
...don't know.

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:45.779
What do you want?

01:44:47.198 --> 01:44:48.323
Are you kidding?

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:52.035
I want you.

01:44:56.332 --> 01:44:59.250
I've wanted you
since the first moment I saw you.

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:05.298
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

01:45:13.557 --> 01:45:15.558
You don't think I'm ordinary?

01:45:18.729 --> 01:45:21.439
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

01:45:24.735 --> 01:45:26.653
Thank you.

01:45:27.863 --> 01:45:30.782
I don't think there's anything worse
than being ordinary.

01:45:50.803 --> 01:45:53.805
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

01:45:53.973 --> 01:45:55.890
I refuse to be a victim.

01:45:56.058 --> 01:46:00.145
Lester... I have something
I have to say to you.

01:46:50.863 --> 01:46:52.363
Are you scared?

01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:55.325
I don't get scared.

01:46:58.496 --> 01:47:00.330
My parents will try to find me.

01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:02.874
Mine won't.

01:47:24.355 --> 01:47:26.356
This is my first time.

01:47:30.152 --> 01:47:31.945
You're kidding.

01:47:32.113 --> 01:47:33.863
I'm sorry.

01:47:34.824 --> 01:47:36.366
I still want to do it.

01:47:36.534 --> 01:47:38.034
I just...

01:47:38.202 --> 01:47:42.997
...thought I should tell you,
in case you wondered why I wasn't...

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.376
...better.

01:47:58.639 --> 01:48:00.223
What's wrong?

01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:09.023
I thought you said I was beautiful.

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:12.819
You are beautiful.

01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:17.407
You are so...

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.701
...beautiful.

01:48:22.538 --> 01:48:24.414
And I would be a very...

01:48:25.791 --> 01:48:26.916
...lucky man.

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:30.587
I feel so stupid.

01:48:30.754 --> 01:48:32.589
Don't.

01:48:34.758 --> 01:48:36.593
I'm sorry.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.262
You have nothing to be sorry about.

01:48:40.931 --> 01:48:42.599
It's OK.

01:48:43.893 --> 01:48:46.102
Everything's OK.

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:04.621
Wow. I was starving.

01:49:05.956 --> 01:49:09.459
- Do you want me to make another one?
- No, I'm fine.

01:49:09.627 --> 01:49:10.835
You sure?

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:15.548
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better.

01:49:15.716 --> 01:49:17.091
Thanks.

01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:21.846
How's Jane?

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:24.265
What do you mean?

01:49:25.809 --> 01:49:26.976
I mean...

01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:30.563
...how's her life?

01:49:30.731 --> 01:49:32.357
Is she happy?

01:49:32.524 --> 01:49:34.651
Is she miserable?

01:49:36.362 --> 01:49:40.448
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

01:49:43.744 --> 01:49:48.331
She's... she is really happy.

01:49:49.833 --> 01:49:51.334
She thinks she's in love.

01:50:03.889 --> 01:50:05.848
Good for her.

01:50:09.687 --> 01:50:10.853
How are you?

01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.614
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

01:50:28.706 --> 01:50:30.123
I'm great.

01:50:37.214 --> 01:50:38.589
I've got to go to the bathroom.

01:50:52.938 --> 01:50:54.605
I'm great.

01:51:29.433 --> 01:51:31.059
Man, oh, man.

01:51:34.438 --> 01:51:37.148
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.019
Oh, my God!

01:53:00.774 --> 01:53:04.068
I had always heard your entire life
flashes in front of your eyes

01:53:04.236 --> 01:53:06.237
the second before you die.

01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:08.990
First of all...

01:53:09.158 --> 01:53:12.535
...that one second
isn't a second at all.

01:53:13.287 --> 01:53:17.790
It stretches on forever,
like an ocean of time.

01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:24.422
For me, it was lying on my back
at Boy Scout camp

01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:26.883
watching falling stars.

01:53:35.559 --> 01:53:40.646
And yellow leaves from the
maple trees that lined our street.

01:53:50.115 --> 01:53:55.036
Or my grandmother's hands and the way
her skin seemed like paper.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.756
And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's

01:54:06.924 --> 01:54:09.759
brand-new Firebird.

01:54:21.563 --> 01:54:22.939
And Janie.

01:54:25.067 --> 01:54:26.901
And Janie.

01:54:58.976 --> 01:55:01.102
And Carolyn.

01:55:06.316 --> 01:55:09.944
I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,

01:55:10.112 --> 01:55:14.407
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the world.

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:20.037
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it
all at once, and it's too much.

01:55:20.998 --> 01:55:24.375
My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.

01:55:26.253 --> 01:55:29.338
And then I remember to relax

01:55:30.424 --> 01:55:33.092
and stop trying to hold on to it.

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.178
And then it flows
through me like rain

01:55:37.347 --> 01:55:40.182
and I can't feel anything but gratitude

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:45.730
for every single moment
of my stupid little life.

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:49.859
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, I'm sure.

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.528
But don't worry.

01:55:53.864 --> 01:55:55.740
You will someday.
