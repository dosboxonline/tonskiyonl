01:16.827 --> 01:19.497
Except for the activity
up in the hayloft...

01:19.664 --> 01:23.167
the farm was pretty quiet
that morning.

01:23.334 --> 01:27.797
The noise upstairs didn't disturb
the dogs that slept in the barn.

01:27.964 --> 01:31.008
They could sleep through anything.

01:37.515 --> 01:40.059
But a lot of the other animals
were awakened...

01:40.226 --> 01:42.270
by all that scurrying overhead.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.606
Some of them just accepted it.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.858
Some were pretty annoyed.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.945
And a few quietly plotted revenge.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.368
But the mood was very different
up in the hayloft.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.749
The farm cat...

02:03.916 --> 02:07.086
had just given birth
to her first litter.

02:07.253 --> 02:09.422
She was determined
to be a good mother...

02:09.588 --> 02:12.341
and never yell at her kittens.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.556
But that approach
would not last very long...

02:19.140 --> 02:21.475
because Milo, one of her kittens...

02:21.642 --> 02:24.145
was trouble
from the very beginning.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.896
As soon as he could walk...

02:26.272 --> 02:29.984
he began wandering
to the edge of the hayloft.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.112
"Milo, dear," his mother said,
"that's not a good idea!"

02:33.279 --> 02:37.658
"Come back here, Milo!" she yelled.

02:37.825 --> 02:42.246
The first animal Milo met
outside of his family was Otis...

02:42.413 --> 02:44.915
one of the barn puppies.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.835
"You're a strange-looking cat,"
Milo said.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.881
"Oh, I'm not a cat. I'm a dog,"
Otis replied.

02:52.048 --> 02:54.133
Milo tried to figure this out
and said:

02:54.300 --> 02:56.677
"Oh, all right, a dog. I understand.
But...

02:56.844 --> 02:59.889
really, deep down inside,
we're all cats, right?"

03:00.056 --> 03:05.603
"No," Otis barked.
"No. Deep down inside, I'm a dog.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.355
I'm a dog."

03:11.650 --> 03:16.280
Nevertheless, as if they knew how
much they would need each other...

03:17.656 --> 03:21.619
Milo and Otis became best friends.

03:24.330 --> 03:28.959
Pretty soon, it was the beginning
of a big day for Milo.

03:38.010 --> 03:42.807
The kittens were now big enough
to leave the hayloft...

03:42.973 --> 03:45.851
and see the world
beyond the barn.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.984
As usual, Milo got into trouble.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.530
He was the first
to start calling out for food.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.996
"Milo, finish your breakfast...

04:06.163 --> 04:09.375
or the puppies will get it!"
his mother yelled.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.544
It seemed to Milo she yelled a lot.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.547
"Milo, did you hear me?"

04:17.091 --> 04:20.386
"And Milo, I've told you
again and again...

04:20.553 --> 04:23.973
please, don't walk
on the chickens."

04:27.435 --> 04:30.187
"Now, listen carefully,"
Milo's mother said...

04:30.354 --> 04:33.315
once again trying to speak softly.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.569
"This is the dock
and down there is the river.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.072
Now, you must never, never go
too close to the edge of the dock.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.365
Everyone understand?"

04:41.991 --> 04:46.287
"What's too close?" Milo asked.
"Is this? Is this too clo...?"

04:46.454 --> 04:49.206
"Milo, get back here,"
his mother demanded.

04:49.373 --> 04:54.378
But Milo, he was swept away
by the river.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.548
And his mother had to go after him.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.967
"A|| of you, back on the dock,"
she ordered.

05:00.134 --> 05:05.097
"Right now. And behave while
I'm gone. Milo, Milo, I'm coming!"

05:09.059 --> 05:11.228
"Oh, Milo!" his mother said.

05:11.395 --> 05:14.440
"Look at you. Are you all right?"

05:15.483 --> 05:18.402
"Yes," Milo meowed.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.322
"Do you think you can follow me
back to the shore?"

05:21.489 --> 05:25.493
"|... I... I think So," Milo said.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.621
"A|| right, be careful,"
his mother ordered...

05:28.787 --> 05:30.915
and began swimming.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.501
"A|| right."

05:53.229 --> 05:56.732
"A|| right. I'm not going to yell,"
his mother said.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.026
"I'm just glad you're all right.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.403
Now dry yourself off, like this...

06:01.862 --> 06:03.364
and follow me back home."

06:03.531 --> 06:07.201
"Can't we swim back?" Milo asked.
"That was fun."

06:07.368 --> 06:10.037
"Milo! Get over here!"

06:11.622 --> 06:14.708
The months passed,
and the farm was humming...

06:14.875 --> 06:16.627
with the sounds of summer.

06:18.045 --> 06:22.967
Milo and Otis grew big enough
to play outside by themselves.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.979
Milo had some new hiding places
he couldn't wait to try out.

06:36.814 --> 06:40.359
Otis sniffed around the yard
for a while.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.828
"You're in the pipe, Milo. Try again."

06:52.830 --> 06:55.207
"How does he do that?"
Milo wondered.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.750
And he tried another spot.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.629
"Oh, not the old puss-in-boots trick,"
Otis groaned.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.465
"Cat's in the can!" Otis shouted.

07:03.632 --> 07:07.177
And Milo slipped off
to another hiding place.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.723
It wasn't easy fooling a dog's nose.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.768
Otis started following
his trail immediately...

07:15.269 --> 07:16.729
and found him again.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.273
Milo tried a harder spot.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.194
But Otis found him there too.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.364
Now Milo needed a brilliant idea.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.869
He thought of a place
where Otis could never sniff him out.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.371
It worked.

07:34.913 --> 07:39.251
But Milo wondered
if it was really worth the trouble.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.634
The following day,
the henhouse was in an uproar.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.221
Milo and Otis went to see
what all the commotion was about.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.564
Suddenly,
one chicken's voice rang out:

08:01.398 --> 08:02.983
"Okay, you mu.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.568
Clear out! Clear out!"

08:04.735 --> 08:08.530
And all the hens left
in a clucking flurry...

08:08.781 --> 08:10.741
because that was Gloria talking...

08:10.908 --> 08:13.452
a young chicken who had scratched
and pecked her way...

08:13.619 --> 08:15.746
to the top rung of the henhouse.

08:15.913 --> 08:20.084
Gloria had a good reason
for wanting to be alone.

08:21.794 --> 08:25.130
"There it is, fellas," Gloria cackled.
"My first egg.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.593
Keep an eye on it, Otis,
while I spread the word."

08:30.386 --> 08:36.183
Otis took the egg-watching
assignment very seriously.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.525
"Did you hear about Gloria?"

08:44.692 --> 08:47.861
"Oh, the egg?
So it finally happened."

08:48.028 --> 08:51.949
"Is she staying at home with it
or is she going back to work?"

08:58.455 --> 09:01.375
"You want me to kick it back to you,
Otis?" Milo asked.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.878
"Now, stop that!" Otis said.
"| kicked it by accident.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.924
We can't start playing games
with the egg. Now, just leave it alone."

09:12.469 --> 09:17.141
"Look, this isn't funny," Otis said.
"Gloria gave us a job to do."

09:17.641 --> 09:20.769
"How long do we have to
stick around this henhouse?"

09:20.936 --> 09:23.147
"Until Gloria comes back."

09:23.313 --> 09:25.482
Maybe you don't realize it, Milo...

09:25.649 --> 09:27.609
but this is a major day for me...

09:27.776 --> 09:30.779
. "becauseâ€œ"
Well, maybe you don't realize that...

09:30.946 --> 09:34.908
this is the day
I've become a watchdog."

09:47.004 --> 09:50.507
Naturally, the sight of a dog
and a cat watching an egg...

09:51.008 --> 09:54.720
brought the usual string
of gawkers...

09:56.013 --> 09:58.515
and thrill-seekers.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.529
Some strange noises brought Milo
out of the henhouse.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.574
What was all this about?

10:33.217 --> 10:35.886
"Hey, could you out that out?"
Milo said.

10:37.596 --> 10:38.806
"Hey!"

10:38.972 --> 10:41.141
But the bird just ignored him.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.019
"Hey!

10:44.186 --> 10:47.231
Your singing stinks. Will you quit it?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.399
Hello in there."

10:51.318 --> 10:54.905
"Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis.
Come here, Otis," a frog croaked.

10:55.072 --> 10:58.242
"What is it?" Otis said.
"I'm supposed to be egg-sitting."

10:58.408 --> 11:01.411
"Otis, it's your cat buddy.
He's got the whole farm crazy.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.706
Do something, and quick.
Otis, come on."

11:04.873 --> 11:06.124
The frog was right.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.794
At that moment,
Milo was teasing a crab...

11:08.961 --> 11:11.129
that was waddling
through the farmyard.

11:11.296 --> 11:15.217
But this time,
someone got the best of Milo.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.983
"He deserved it," the frog croaked.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.235
"Hey, he's my friend," Otis said.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.611
"He still deserved it."

11:35.821 --> 11:40.784
The trouble with guarding an egg
is you have to always be on guard.

11:42.661 --> 11:46.623
And outside, Milo and Otis
suddenly remembered:

11:48.542 --> 11:50.460
"The egg!"

11:52.129 --> 11:54.131
"Freeze!" Otis barked.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.677
"Touch that egg
and you're dead meat!"

12:01.638 --> 12:04.975
"I mean it, punk!" Otis growled.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.478
"Just try something.
Make my doggy day."

12:08.645 --> 12:10.772
"Lighten up. I didn't touch...

12:10.939 --> 12:14.318
your cruddy egg,"
the hedgehog grumbled.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.361
"Probably rotten anyway."

12:16.528 --> 12:22.117
Milo wanted just one more look
at that weird animal.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.714
The noise attracted
a group of local snoops...

12:36.089 --> 12:38.800
looking to dig up some scandal.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.487
But Milo's attention
was focused somewhere else.

13:13.752 --> 13:19.341
"Milo," Otis said,
"| think we're having a baby."

13:50.747 --> 13:55.460
The chick dried itself off,
looked at Otis and cheeped:

13:55.627 --> 13:58.672
"Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy?"

13:59.715 --> 14:04.553
"Oh, no, I'm not your mommy," Otis
said. "Your mommy's a chicken."

14:04.720 --> 14:09.141
The other animals told Otis he'd better
take the chick to Gloria, and quickly.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.102
Which he did. But the chick
kept coming back to Otis.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.270
"Mommy."

14:13.437 --> 14:15.272
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy."

14:16.356 --> 14:19.484
"| told you, I'm not your mommy,"
Otis said again and again.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.361
"Now go back to Gloria.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.157
Do you understand? You're a chicken,
not a dog. A chicken."

14:25.323 --> 14:29.119
"Woof," the chick peeped.
"Woof, woof, Mommy."

14:29.286 --> 14:32.122
Once again, they tried to make
the mixed-up chick...

14:32.289 --> 14:33.790
join the other chickens.

14:34.124 --> 14:38.128
"Okay, you want to be a dog?" Otis
barked. "Here's what you've got to do.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.464
You've got to be a rough, tough...

14:40.630 --> 14:43.550
"mean, fighting dog, like this."

14:44.051 --> 14:46.803
The chick didn't like
the sound of this at all.

14:46.970 --> 14:52.476
"Okay, puppy," Otis ordered.
"Your turn. Give it a try. Give it a try."

14:52.893 --> 14:56.813
"Mommy, chicken mommy,"
the chick peeped, and ran to Gloria.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.607
"Oh, it worked," Otis thought.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.609
"I'll miss him. I'll miss him.

15:00.776 --> 15:04.404
But at least he finally found out
that he is a chicken."

15:05.363 --> 15:08.200
"Are you sure you know
where we're going?" Otis asked.

15:08.366 --> 15:12.329
"Sure. The dock is right this way,
and you've never seen the river.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.998
"Come on," said Milo.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.421
Otis had a feeling
there was trouble ahead.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.348
"Wow, look at this thing, Otis,"
Milo said.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.225
"Do you think we can eat it?"

15:33.391 --> 15:36.812
"Who would eat something
that looks like that?" Otis replied...

15:36.978 --> 15:39.439
and continued on to the river.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.818
And then it happened.

15:42.984 --> 15:46.446
When Otis was just sitting
on the dock, wasting time...

15:56.998 --> 16:00.210
Otis dried off and came back
to settle the score...

16:00.377 --> 16:04.005
with that... That thing.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.675
Milo, meanwhile...

16:06.842 --> 16:10.345
stumbled on
an excellent hiding place.

16:10.846 --> 16:14.558
He was sure Otis would never
be able to find him this time.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.560
"Surprise!" Milo shouted.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.478
"| finally fooled you!"

16:18.937 --> 16:21.356
"Milo," Otis barked,
"get out of there...

16:21.523 --> 16:23.066
before something happens."

16:23.733 --> 16:24.943
But something did.

16:26.528 --> 16:31.074
"Quick, jump in! This'|| be fun!" Milo
shouted. Otis didn't know what to do.

16:31.241 --> 16:35.579
"Hey, this is great. Come on!
Hurry up, Otis! Come with me."

16:35.745 --> 16:39.708
Maybe Milo was having a terrific time,
but Otis was pretty scared.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.211
He knew he had to rescue Milo
so he ran alongside the river...

16:43.378 --> 16:46.173
trying to keep up,
and without much success.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.763
Then Otis saw a bridge up ahead.

16:53.930 --> 16:59.436
Maybe he could jump off the bridge
into the box if he hurried.

17:00.478 --> 17:05.317
But he was too late. There was only
one way to catch up with Milo now.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.693
"On, boy."

17:07.736 --> 17:09.195
Here we go.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.864
<i>God.</i>

17:18.288 --> 17:21.790
But that didn't work either.
Otis just couldn't swim fast enough...

17:21.958 --> 17:23.251
and the river...

17:23.417 --> 17:26.296
took Milo farther downstream.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.999
Milo wasn't really worried
until he lost sight of Otis.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.673
Suddenly he heard something
moving in the bushes. Was it Otis?

18:09.839 --> 18:12.676
Definitely not.

18:13.260 --> 18:17.472
Milo tried to duck low in the box
so the bear wouldn't see him.

18:30.610 --> 18:35.240
But the box was drifting
right towards the hungry animal.

18:55.218 --> 18:59.014
"Close call," said Milo,
poking his head up.

18:59.180 --> 19:03.518
But unfortunately much too soon.
The bear saw what was in that box.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.563
Then came Otis.

19:06.730 --> 19:10.233
He surveyed the scene and he knew
sometimes a dog's gotta do...

19:10.400 --> 19:12.193
what a dog's gotta do.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.512
Suddenly Otis started
swimming away...

19:39.679 --> 19:42.682
and said to himself,
"What am I doing?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.560
That bear is 10 times my size."

19:45.727 --> 19:48.855
And Otis came up
with a much more sensible plan.

19:51.566 --> 19:55.612
He ran up on the riverbank, leading
the bear away from Milo. It worked.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.907
The bear followed him
and forgot all about...

19:59.074 --> 20:01.951
the orange cat in the floating box.

20:11.753 --> 20:15.256
Milo kept drifting along,
but he was getting a little concerned...

20:15.423 --> 20:20.637
because the river
was beginning to move faster...

20:21.805 --> 20:24.057
and faster.

21:28.538 --> 21:32.167
Milo was all right,
except for being wet.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.502
He'd lost track of Otis now...

21:34.669 --> 21:38.882
and he was drifting
farther and farther from home.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.561
By the time the moon rose...

21:52.020 --> 21:57.192
the river had carried Milo
deep into the forest.

21:57.901 --> 22:03.531
Now and then, he saw some eyes
flashing among the trees.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.327
And he heard mysterious hoots...

22:07.494 --> 22:09.370
and growls...

22:09.537 --> 22:11.956
and cries in the night.

22:14.209 --> 22:17.921
His trip down the river
wasn't fun anymore.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.257
It had turned into something
lonely and frightening.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.677
He began to wish
he'd never jumped into this box...

22:24.844 --> 22:28.264
and he began to wish
he was home.

22:31.726 --> 22:36.606
In the water, Milo could see
the reflection of the moon.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.943
It seemed to be trembling
as much as he was...

22:40.109 --> 22:43.404
in the chilly, misty night.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.617
Sleep was not possible.

22:48.326 --> 22:51.788
He drifted on through the darkness...

22:51.955 --> 22:54.207
hoping to find the morning...

22:54.374 --> 22:57.794
waiting just around the bend.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.019
When daylight came...

23:15.186 --> 23:17.981
Milo saw a farm on the riverbank.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.692
For one happy moment,
he thought he was home...

23:20.858 --> 23:23.528
and cried out for joy.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.823
But he looked again.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.409
Those cows were all strangers...

23:29.576 --> 23:32.328
and he remembered
he was far away from his farm.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.707
He didn't know when he would
ever see it again.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.626
Otis had not given up his chase...

23:38.793 --> 23:41.004
not by a long shot.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.173
He was running along the riverbank
in hot pursuit.

23:44.340 --> 23:48.094
To keep up his spirits, he began
singing a dog marching song.

23:48.261 --> 23:52.265
<i>Here comes the dog
Strong and brave, woof.</i>

23:52.473 --> 23:55.059
<i>Here comes the dog
Your life</i> he...

23:58.688 --> 24:01.774
He then decided
to skip the whole thing.

24:11.367 --> 24:15.246
Otis followed the river
until it flowed into the wetlands...

24:15.413 --> 24:17.999
and he came to
a forbidding place...

24:18.166 --> 24:22.003
a place like none
he'd ever seen before:

24:22.712 --> 24:25.048
The Deadwood Swamp...

24:25.214 --> 24:28.051
a bog where skeleton trees...

24:28.217 --> 24:31.054
grew without leaves or branches...

24:31.220 --> 24:34.057
and where no creature could live...

24:34.223 --> 24:38.519
except for the dreaded
Deadwood birds.

24:38.686 --> 24:43.066
And one of them was perching
on a familiar wooden box.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.841
"Okay, punk," Otis barked.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.762
"There's the box.
Now, where's the cat?"

25:12.929 --> 25:17.183
"Poor cat. Cat so sad,"
the bird croaked.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.268
"Look in the box."

25:19.435 --> 25:22.397
Otis prepared himself
and peeked in the box...

25:22.563 --> 25:27.360
and saw only
a solitary black feather.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.114
And the bird flew away, cackling.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.955
In fact, Milo was nowhere
near the Deadwood Swamp.

25:39.122 --> 25:42.083
After his box got stuck there,
he ran.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.002
He ran from those birds
as quickly as he could.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.547
Now he found himself
in a burning valley.

25:47.714 --> 25:51.259
The ground was hot
and the smoke made his eyes sting.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.553
He had to get out of there.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.476
Milo ran until he came
to an open meadow...

26:00.643 --> 26:03.813
where he saw a kind of animal
he'd never seen before.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.316
Feeling pretty hungry,
he immediately wondered:

26:07.483 --> 26:10.653
"Is that something you can eat?"

26:11.154 --> 26:14.866
Well, perhaps not, but even
if this creature wasn't food...

26:15.032 --> 26:18.327
maybe he had some hidden away.

26:19.829 --> 26:22.582
"Hello, someone there?"
the fox called.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.543
Milo kept himself well-hidden.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.881
"Oh, well,
time for lunch break anyway."

26:30.339 --> 26:33.509
Which was exactly
what Milo wanted to hear.

26:37.054 --> 26:41.809
He trailed the fox, waiting to see
just what was on his lunch menu.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.188
"| must be very careful,"
Milo thought.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.482
"| must make sure
I stay out of sight.

26:47.648 --> 26:51.194
And above all,
I must keep absolutely silent."

26:56.032 --> 26:59.243
"| know I put it around here
somewhere," the fox said.

27:00.912 --> 27:03.289
"Oh, there it is!"

27:04.165 --> 27:05.583
And Milo's mouth watered...

27:05.750 --> 27:09.837
when he saw the fox
holding a plump, juicy muskrat.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.839
The fox felt someone watching him.

27:12.006 --> 27:15.092
"Hello. Who's there?

27:15.259 --> 27:18.054
No sense taking chances
with a lovely meal like this."

27:18.471 --> 27:20.223
And he began burying his lunch...

27:20.389 --> 27:23.726
where he figured no one
would ever be able to find it.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.187
"Yeah, here, my precious muskrat.

27:26.354 --> 27:30.399
"You should be safe there
till dinnertime," the fox said.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.616
Milo crept slowly down the tree...

27:38.783 --> 27:41.911
and watched the fox
run over the horizon.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.917
And then, once on the ground...

27:48.084 --> 27:51.921
Milo knew just how to
get his paws on a big...

27:52.088 --> 27:55.383
tasty muskrat lunch.

28:27.498 --> 28:31.460
Otis, meanwhile,
had traveled through the wetlands...

28:31.627 --> 28:34.422
to a beach full of clam holes.

28:34.589 --> 28:39.343
A clam might be able to help him,
but how does a dog talk to a clam?

28:39.510 --> 28:42.722
He remembered there was one
magic word everyone understood...

28:42.889 --> 28:44.599
and that was "please."

28:44.765 --> 28:46.976
So he marched up to a clam hole
and said:

28:47.143 --> 28:49.770
"Excuse me, please."

28:55.985 --> 28:59.155
But Otis had a bigger problem
than rude clams.

28:59.906 --> 29:03.659
The clouds were getting
darker and darker...

29:03.826 --> 29:07.997
and a chilly wind
was whipping across the countryside.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.375
Milo was several miles
from the beach...

29:11.542 --> 29:14.003
caught in the same storm.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.184
He got a little wet...

29:28.351 --> 29:31.312
and he felt awfully lonesome
without Otis...

29:31.479 --> 29:33.856
but at least he was safe.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.321
At the shore...

29:41.697 --> 29:44.659
Otis was not so lucky.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.204
The tide came in so fast...

29:48.371 --> 29:50.623
that the rock Otis
had been sitting on...

29:50.790 --> 29:53.668
was completely surrounded
by water.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.629
Soon his dry rock
would be underwater.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.966
The beach was far
and the water was rough.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.385
He'd never be able
to swim to shore.

30:02.551 --> 30:05.304
And the water was growing higher.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.269
Now the water was up to his paws.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.897
He'd have to try to swim.

30:22.780 --> 30:26.492
He took a deep breath, but just
when he was ready to dive in...

30:34.917 --> 30:38.546
"Oh, not again,"
the sea turtle gurgled.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.589
"Every time the tide comes in...

30:40.756 --> 30:43.968
some fool gets stuck out here."

30:44.593 --> 30:47.888
Otis wasn't sure
what this turtle wanted.

30:52.643 --> 30:56.230
"| say, look, do you want a ride
back to shore or not?

30:56.397 --> 30:59.108
I mean, don't you know
I came out here to save you?"

30:59.275 --> 31:01.527
"No," Otis Said, "| didn't know that."

31:01.694 --> 31:05.322
"Well, now you know. Get on."

32:18.687 --> 32:23.943
"Now, just stay on the shore, where
you belong," the turtle grumbled.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.113
"Thanks for saving me," Otis said.

32:28.197 --> 32:29.532
"Thanks, nothing.

32:29.698 --> 32:33.536
Next time the tide comes in,
I'll have to rescue somebody else.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.787
What a life."

32:35.287 --> 32:36.455
"You saved mine."

32:37.456 --> 32:40.709
"| save someone just about
every month. Did you know that?"

32:41.502 --> 32:44.630
"No," said Otis, "| didn't know that."

32:46.465 --> 32:51.428
"Well," said the turtle, "now you know.

32:53.722 --> 32:57.643
"Oh, dear, back to sea."

33:05.192 --> 33:07.528
Under a fresh, bright sky...

33:07.695 --> 33:10.614
Otis resumed his search for Milo.

33:14.451 --> 33:18.914
He saw in the distance an animal
that he thought might be helpful.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.440
"God.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.443
Much better!"

33:49.737 --> 33:53.365
"Excuse me," Otis called out,
"I'm looking for a friend of mine."

33:53.532 --> 33:56.285
"I'm looking for someone
to play with," the fox said.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.287
"Wanna race me
across the stream?"

33:58.454 --> 34:00.247
"| haven't got time," Otis said...

34:00.414 --> 34:02.750
sensing this fox
wasn't gonna be any help.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.127
"Wait. What kind of animal
are you anyway?"

34:05.294 --> 34:07.296
"I'm a dog, of course,"
Otis answered.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.590
"How can you be a dog?
You have no tail."

34:09.757 --> 34:11.175
Otis was outraged.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.469
"| certainly do. Look."

34:14.178 --> 34:17.306
"You call that a tail?
This is a tail."

34:17.473 --> 34:20.976
And with that,
the fox jumped away laughing.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.485
Milo, far away...

34:29.652 --> 34:33.489
stumbled upon a road
that looked clear and safe.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.534
He marveled at this road
made of wood and iron...

34:37.701 --> 34:41.830
and decided to follow the road
and see where it would take him.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.831
But then...

34:59.431 --> 35:02.184
Milo had ducked just in time.

35:02.351 --> 35:06.355
"What was that?" he wondered.
"It could've run right over me."

35:07.356 --> 35:09.483
But Milo was determined.

35:09.650 --> 35:14.280
He made up his mind
to follow the wood and iron road.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.492
Although he'd certainly keep on
the lookout for another of those...

35:18.659 --> 35:20.369
noisy animals.

35:21.537 --> 35:27.334
The iron road led Milo
to a meadow of wild cotton blossoms.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.883
Now Milo was plenty tired.

35:35.050 --> 35:39.138
Maybe someone could help him
find a safe place to rest for a while.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.348
Maybe someone like...

35:41.640 --> 35:42.808
her.

35:43.267 --> 35:46.478
"You look tired and thirsty,"
a deer whispered.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.896
"Follow me.

35:48.063 --> 35:52.192
"Bound with me through
fields of clouds," the deer sang.

35:53.569 --> 35:57.531
"I'm not sure cats know
how to bound," Milo said.

35:57.698 --> 36:01.035
"Well, just let your heart lead
and your feet will follow.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.620
And we'll bound and leap,
like a gentle breeze.

36:03.787 --> 36:07.666
Bound and leap, like a zephyr set free.
Bound, and of course, leap."

36:07.833 --> 36:11.462
"Well, I don't know. It just
doesn't look right when I do it."

36:11.920 --> 36:14.548
"Frolic with me, friend.
Come, frolic. Frolic."

36:14.715 --> 36:17.718
"Okay, okay, look, I've got it.
I'm frolicking.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.429
I'm frolicking. You see?"

36:21.930 --> 36:24.641
"You can stop frolicking now,"
the deer cooed.

36:24.808 --> 36:29.313
She showed Milo
to the cool water of a forest pool.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.784
"I think I'm a little tuckered out,"
Milo said.

36:41.950 --> 36:46.747
"Yes, it is possible to over-frolic,"
the deer murmured.

36:46.914 --> 36:50.709
"Here, let me show you a place
where we can rest."

36:52.628 --> 36:55.964
And the deer took Milo
to a soft, mossy spot...

36:56.465 --> 36:58.467
on the forest floor.

36:59.385 --> 37:04.306
And Milo was asleep
within moments.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.535
Otis knew he was on the right track.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.911
He had trailed Milo...

37:26.078 --> 37:28.622
from the Deadwood Swamp
to the fox's meadow.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.499
And now, if he just kept going...

37:30.666 --> 37:35.254
maybe he'd finally find
the friend he missed so much.

37:40.551 --> 37:43.846
But now, it was the end
of a long day...

37:44.847 --> 37:47.474
of hard traveling.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.824
As evening was falling...

38:03.991 --> 38:09.455
Milo decided the safest place
to spend the night would be in a tree.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.875
He settled down
and watched the sun set...

38:13.041 --> 38:16.712
wondering what sorts of creatures
would begin stirring...

38:17.463 --> 38:19.673
after dark.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.897
"And what are you doing up here?"
a strange bird said to Milo.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.441
"Hiding from the screech owls,
I suppose."

38:37.608 --> 38:39.568
"Sorry, sorry," Milo said.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.571
"Does this nest belong to you?
I didn't know."

38:42.988 --> 38:47.284
"Yes, and it's not just any nest,
I'll have you know.

38:47.451 --> 38:50.204
I'm the night bird,
and that is a dreaming nest."

38:50.370 --> 38:52.414
"What do you mean?" Milo asked.

38:52.581 --> 38:55.292
"Well, dear cat,
anyone sleeping there...

38:55.459 --> 38:59.087
"will have his sleep flooded
with dreams," the bird said.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.797
"But it's a safe place..."

39:00.964 --> 39:03.467
Safe from those screech owls.

39:03.634 --> 39:06.720
So settle down in the nest,
dear cat...

39:06.887 --> 39:09.264
and be prepared for the dreams.

39:09.431 --> 39:13.852
They may be sad or frightening
or beautiful...

39:14.019 --> 39:16.271
but sleeping in that nest...

39:16.438 --> 39:20.400
"dreams will surely come."

39:23.278 --> 39:25.906
And Milo's dreams began...

39:26.073 --> 39:29.284
almost the moment he was asleep.

39:30.911 --> 39:36.291
First, a sweet dream
about being back on the farm...

39:38.293 --> 39:40.921
and seeing old friends.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.763
And about the time his mother
left him...

39:49.930 --> 39:52.849
with a doting babysitter.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.815
And then came a dream
that was very sad.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.066
A dream about Otis...

40:01.233 --> 40:04.319
and how they used to play together
when they were young.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.697
Oh, would it ever be like this again?

40:06.863 --> 40:10.701
Would he ever see Otis again?

40:13.203 --> 40:15.330
It seemed so real.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.126
Milo could almost hear
Otis' voice.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.133
But it wasn't Otis' voice at all.

40:26.300 --> 40:30.596
It was a cry for help
from down on the ground.

40:32.389 --> 40:35.809
Milo woke up and, forgetting
all about the screech owls...

40:35.976 --> 40:37.603
he climbed down the tree...

40:37.769 --> 40:40.439
towards the desperate cry.

40:44.735 --> 40:47.988
Milo hid as an owl swooped down
and carried off a field mouse.

40:48.155 --> 40:52.701
And though he was a little scared,
Milo still followed the cries for help.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.502
Please, somebody help me!

41:03.337 --> 41:05.922
"My leg is caught," the pig cried.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.217
"And that bird, he'll be back."

41:09.384 --> 41:11.803
"Take it easy," said Milo,
working quickly...

41:11.970 --> 41:13.972
to free the pig's foot.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.558
"You're fine," Milo said.

41:16.725 --> 41:20.395
"Now, do you know a place
where we'd be safe?"

41:21.104 --> 41:24.650
"Well, back with my family,"
said the pig. "Come with me."

41:25.233 --> 41:26.777
"Come on!"

41:50.300 --> 41:55.180
The pig's family squealed with joy
when they saw him return.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.271
And over the noise, the pig yelled:

42:03.438 --> 42:05.649
"Hey, Mom, here comes the cat!

42:05.816 --> 42:08.527
Yeah, the cat that saved me."

42:14.116 --> 42:17.536
The pigs offered Milo
a place to sleep.

42:17.786 --> 42:20.539
And the next morning,
he woke up and thought:

42:20.706 --> 42:22.749
"These pigs are all right.

42:22.916 --> 42:26.670
I mean, friendly and kind.
Just a nice bunch of pigs."

42:26.837 --> 42:29.131
But then the mother pig squealed:

42:29.297 --> 42:30.465
"Breakfast!"

42:30.632 --> 42:33.051
And the table manners
of this family...

42:33.218 --> 42:36.138
came as quite a surprise to Milo.

43:08.670 --> 43:12.674
The whole business was
a little too messy for any cat to take.

43:12.841 --> 43:18.096
But that was the way it was done
at mealtime in this particular family.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.350
Milo went to say goodbye
to his friend...

43:22.517 --> 43:25.771
who still had some breakfast
on his face.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.981
"Come on," said the cat.

43:28.148 --> 43:32.027
"You've at least got to keep
your face clean."

43:32.194 --> 43:36.031
After goodbyes, Milo reflected
on the family he'd stayed with.

43:36.656 --> 43:40.869
"Jeez," he thought,
"no wonder they call them pigs."

43:43.163 --> 43:47.876
After a whole day of traveling,
Milo arrived at a brook.

43:52.839 --> 43:57.552
In the water, he could see
some delicious-looking trout.

44:06.645 --> 44:08.355
After some consideration...

44:08.522 --> 44:11.983
he figured out
how he could catch one.

44:24.704 --> 44:29.459
"That cat has got to be kidding,"
muttered a nearby raccoon.

44:36.842 --> 44:39.094
But all at once...

44:39.261 --> 44:41.263
Milo caught one.

44:45.517 --> 44:47.519
And the raccoon wanted it.

44:49.104 --> 44:52.107
"Hey, cat, nice fish,"
the raccoon said.

44:53.108 --> 44:56.570
"Too bad it's gonna be
the one that got away."

44:56.736 --> 45:00.866
But the raccoon wasn't the only one
interested in Milo's fish.

45:17.632 --> 45:21.344
They battled over the trout until
the bear caught sight of something...

45:21.511 --> 45:23.722
bigger and tastier:

45:23.889 --> 45:25.765
A cat.

45:29.269 --> 45:32.981
Milo knew he wouldn't have a chance
against the bear on the ground...

45:33.148 --> 45:35.483
but perhaps in the air.

45:47.537 --> 45:51.124
Milo was safe,
but never did get his lunch.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.710
Pretty soon, he had another chance
for a meal.

45:53.877 --> 45:57.839
"Some seagull eggs might be tasty,"
Milo thought.

46:03.803 --> 46:06.640
But suddenly, up above
a seagull screamed:

46:06.806 --> 46:09.851
"Cat! Cat! There's a cat
near the babies!"

46:10.018 --> 46:13.855
A chorus of birds joined in.
"Cat! Cat!"

46:14.230 --> 46:18.360
"Come on, peck him away!
Peck him away from the nests!"

46:23.531 --> 46:25.784
The seagulls were pecking him,
hurting him.

46:25.951 --> 46:28.161
There was only one way
for Milo to escape.

46:51.559 --> 46:57.190
"A|| this just for a lunch?"
Milo thought to himself.

46:57.357 --> 47:01.820
"Well, who ever heard of
eating seagull eggs anyway?"

47:04.739 --> 47:09.494
Milo climbed out of the sea,
feeling salty, wet and cold...

47:09.661 --> 47:13.081
and there'd been times
he'd looked a lot better too.

47:13.248 --> 47:17.460
But at least he came to shore near
a shack that looked warm and safe.

47:17.627 --> 47:22.090
He would have thought differently
if he'd known who lived in the shack.

48:02.630 --> 48:05.467
Milo's fur was beginning to dry off...

48:05.633 --> 48:08.636
and he was feeling safe at last...

48:08.803 --> 48:12.932
."unfilhelooked
at what was right outside.

48:18.104 --> 48:20.899
"Stay calm," Milo thought.
"It's all right...

48:21.066 --> 48:23.985
as long as he doesn't...
Oh, no!"

48:46.966 --> 48:50.804
Milo tried to hide, but the bear
smelled the cat right away...

48:50.970 --> 48:55.433
and Milo knew somehow he was
going to have to outsmart this bear.

48:59.104 --> 49:01.689
"Okay, tough guy!
Come and get me!" he shouted...

49:01.856 --> 49:03.942
darting back into a drawer.

49:04.984 --> 49:08.947
The bear reached for Milo
with an open, hungry mouth.

49:13.785 --> 49:16.121
"No, no, up here!" Milo yelled.
"Up here!

49:21.209 --> 49:23.378
Come on, just reach in
and grab me!

49:25.213 --> 49:26.256
Too late!

49:29.134 --> 49:30.969
Hey, down here!

49:31.761 --> 49:32.804
Wanna come in?

49:39.519 --> 49:43.356
I'll help you.
I'll pull you in by your nose.

49:43.606 --> 49:45.233
"Which drawer has the cat?"

49:48.945 --> 49:50.947
"Now, here's a little hint."

49:55.410 --> 49:57.704
Now the bear was raging mad.

49:57.871 --> 50:01.082
He'd had enough of rummaging
through drawers after a cat.

50:01.249 --> 50:04.752
Now he was going to pull
the whole shack apart.

50:06.045 --> 50:08.756
It looked bad,
but Milo had one last plan.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.759
He jumped on top of the dresser.
The bear came closer.

50:11.926 --> 50:14.846
Milo could feel the tips
of his claws.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.313
And just when the bear
almost had him...

50:24.772 --> 50:28.401
"Perfect shot," Milo said,
feeling pretty good.

50:29.736 --> 50:32.947
And the bear, knocked silly...

50:33.114 --> 50:36.034
stumbled out of the shack,
wondering what hit him.

50:45.919 --> 50:47.962
Milo was afraid
the bear would be back.

50:48.129 --> 50:51.549
He thought he'd be a lot safer
hiding at the top of a tree.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.510
But he was wrong again.

51:58.157 --> 52:00.326
Climbing out of the pit
was impossible.

52:00.493 --> 52:03.621
Milo called for help,
even though he knew it was useless.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.499
Nobody would hear him out here.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.050
But someone did.

52:29.147 --> 52:33.693
Milo couldn't believe what he saw.
Could it really be Otis?

52:34.193 --> 52:38.906
"Don't worry," Otis barked.
<i>"|'||</i> get you out somehow."

52:50.752 --> 52:53.046
"Did you try climbing out?"

52:56.132 --> 52:59.552
"It's too deep. See?" Milo said.

53:05.016 --> 53:07.310
"| have an idea," Otis said.

53:42.387 --> 53:44.639
"Climb it!" Otis barked.

53:44.806 --> 53:47.308
"| think it's too short."

53:55.149 --> 53:59.404
"Don't worry!" Otis barked.
"|'ve got another idea."

54:13.334 --> 54:15.670
"Grab the end," Otis shouted.

54:33.938 --> 54:39.527
"We did it!" Otis yelled,
opening his mouth by mistake.

54:57.170 --> 55:00.923
"A|| right, hold on!" Otis growled...

55:01.090 --> 55:04.719
making sure to keep his teeth
tightly clenched.

55:18.399 --> 55:20.818
"Are you all right?" Otis asked.

55:20.985 --> 55:23.571
"You have no idea
what I've been through.

55:23.738 --> 55:26.699
Bears, snakes, even seagulls!"

55:27.825 --> 55:31.162
But that was all behind them.
Now they were bursting with joy...

55:31.329 --> 55:35.291
because finally,
they were back together.

56:03.945 --> 56:06.948
"Listen. What was that?" Otis said.

56:10.409 --> 56:13.955
They ran to the cat cries
and Milo was suddenly breathless.

56:14.288 --> 56:16.874
"Hello. I'm Joyce."

56:17.041 --> 56:18.292
"Joyce?"

56:18.459 --> 56:19.961
"Joyce!"

56:20.127 --> 56:24.590
Joyce and Milo seemed to get
friendlier and friendlier.

56:28.469 --> 56:31.806
Otis had never seen
such ridiculous behavior.

56:38.563 --> 56:40.064
Never.

56:41.232 --> 56:44.360
"Joyce, come back with me
to my farm."

56:44.527 --> 56:46.070
"|... I don't know.

56:46.988 --> 56:49.365
A farm isn't exactly my lifestyle."

56:49.532 --> 56:54.453
"Oh, you'll love it!" Milo said.
"They'll all love you. I love you."

56:55.162 --> 56:57.665
Joyce finally said yes.

56:57.832 --> 57:02.003
And the three travelers began
the journey back to the farm.

57:03.462 --> 57:06.257
Milo had a plan.
They would find the river...

57:06.424 --> 57:09.719
that carried him away
and follow it back home.

57:09.885 --> 57:12.847
Joyce knew where a river
flowed through these woods...

57:13.014 --> 57:16.142
so she led the way,
with Milo by her side...

57:17.351 --> 57:19.562
and Otis trailing behind.

57:19.729 --> 57:23.190
"Are you sure you know where
we're going?" Otis said.

57:24.191 --> 57:27.236
"| don't see any rivers
around here."

57:28.696 --> 57:31.449
"Trust me," said Joyce.
Otis just growled.

57:31.616 --> 57:36.037
"Come on, Otis!" Milo called out. "We
want to make it home before winter."

57:36.662 --> 57:39.790
"Otis, where are you?" Milo shouted.

57:39.957 --> 57:42.585
"Have you known him long?"
Joyce asked.

57:42.752 --> 57:45.379
Finally, just as Joyce said,
they came to a river.

57:45.546 --> 57:48.799
"| hope it's the right one," Milo said.

57:49.675 --> 57:53.054
They followed it upstream,
hoping to see something familiar.

57:53.429 --> 57:56.265
"Yes, this is the right river!"
Milo cried out.

57:56.432 --> 58:01.687
<i>"|'||</i> never forget those waterfalls.
I told you she'd do it! Otis! Otis!"

58:02.104 --> 58:05.650
Otis was feeling pretty rotten
about the way the trip was going.

58:05.816 --> 58:09.445
Milo was always with Joyce and
hardly paid any attention to him.

58:09.612 --> 58:12.114
So Otis made a decision.

58:14.367 --> 58:16.077
"You two follow the river.

58:16.243 --> 58:19.872
I'm going over the mountains...

58:20.247 --> 58:22.583
by myself."

58:22.750 --> 58:24.919
"Don't be a fool, Otis. Stay with us."

58:25.086 --> 58:26.504
"I'd rather go alone."

58:27.296 --> 58:29.090
"Hey, where are you going, Otis?"

58:29.882 --> 58:31.842
But he didn't answer.

58:32.009 --> 58:35.096
And he didn't even look back.

58:56.283 --> 58:58.119
Otis was only gone a few days...

58:58.285 --> 59:02.873
when the first snowstorm of winter
interrupted the journey.

59:03.040 --> 59:06.460
Traveling through the snow
would be too dangerous.

59:06.627 --> 59:10.005
Milo and Joyce knew they'd
have to find shelter in the woods...

59:10.172 --> 59:12.425
and wait until spring.

59:30.317 --> 59:34.572
They took a cozy winter home
in a tree trunk.

59:42.288 --> 59:47.460
While Otis trudged through the snow,
continuing on his way.

01:00:09.482 --> 01:00:14.320
That afternoon, the winter sun
was warm enough to melt the snow...

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:18.073
and it came tumbling down
from the trees.

01:00:26.165 --> 01:00:28.667
Otis was all right, but he was sure...

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:32.880
he heard a call for help
coming from somewhere.

01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:44.475
Otis fought his way
through the snow...

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:47.603
heading towards
the voice in the woods.

01:00:57.822 --> 01:00:59.740
"Where are you?" Otis hollered.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.911
"Over here,"
whimpered a dog's voice.

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:08.249
"|... I... I can't dig
out. It's solid ice."

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.209
At first, Otis was exasperated.

01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:15.422
But then he saw her.

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:18.509
"I'm Sondra," she said.
"Who are you?"

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:22.388
"Otis. I've never met
a dog like you, Sandra."

01:01:22.555 --> 01:01:25.933
"No, Sondra.
It's a French pronunciation."

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.853
"She's smart too."

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.982
And Otis, for the very first time
in his rather serious life...

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:37.111
began acting very silly.

01:01:41.991 --> 01:01:47.496
Now Otis began to understand
what had come over Milo.

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:50.833
He and Sondra kept on
romping through the drifts...

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.961
kicking up snow and
disturbing some of the more...

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:56.755
proper neighbors.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.232
Sondra had been spending the winter
in a small but comfortable cave.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:18.736
She and Otis decided
to stay there until spring.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:21.447
And though a chill wind
was blowing outside...

01:02:21.614 --> 01:02:24.909
the winter
suddenly seemed warmer.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.928
Sometime later, during
the last weeks of the long winter...

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:47.264
Joyce was making preparations.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:51.185
The time was drawing near.

01:02:55.356 --> 01:02:58.150
"You okay, Joyce?" Milo asked.
"Want some more dinner?

01:02:58.317 --> 01:03:00.444
Remember, you're eating
for eight now."

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.865
"Milo. Milo, I think it's time."

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:09.078
"Okay," Milo said.
"Remember the way to breathe?"

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.555
"| hope that turns out
to be a kitten," thought Milo.

01:03:29.765 --> 01:03:31.642
"It is! It's a little girl kitten!"

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:36.397
"And six more to come, Milo. Yes."

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:43.237
That same day, not too far away...

01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:45.656
Otis was in his cave with Sondra...

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.616
who was heavy with puppy.

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:49.410
"Is it going to be soon?"

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:54.665
"Well, any minute now, Otis,"
Sondra whispered.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:04.842
"It's Otis, Jr.!"

01:04:07.136 --> 01:04:11.974
It's Otis, Jr.!
I'm a father! I'm a father!

01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:14.977
"It's a boy! It's a boy! It's a boy!"

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:18.605
"Otis, you ran out a little too soon."

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:21.942
"It's a litter! It's a litter!"

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.962
Milo watched as the kittens
got bigger every day.

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.633
And the puppies grew even faster.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.637
"You know," Otis said, "we really
should think of names for them."

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.098
"Oh, I did that already,"
Sondra replied.

01:04:53.265 --> 01:04:55.517
"| gave them all French names.

01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:57.019
This one is Jean-Pierre.

01:04:57.186 --> 01:05:01.190
That's Francois, and the one
on the end is Suzette."

01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:18.332
As the kittens grew,
Milo soon noticed...

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:21.543
that one of them was turning out
to look just like him.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:25.130
"I'll bet that one's gonna
be trouble," Milo thought.

01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:28.133
And Milo started remembering...

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.345
when he was a little kitten
back on the farm.

01:05:31.512 --> 01:05:34.014
He even remembered
the day he met Otis.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.184
But as the cold weather
dragged on...

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:40.062
Otis and Sondra faced
a serious problem.

01:05:40.229 --> 01:05:43.649
There was too much winter left
and too little food.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:49.029
Otis knew he'd have to
go out and find some.

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:08.423
He remembered a pond
where he'd seen a bear...

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.552
scoop up some fish
through a hole in the ice.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.429
Maybe he'd be lucky
and find some fish there.

01:06:19.852 --> 01:06:25.649
But the bitter, cold weather
had frozen over the fishing hole.

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:30.863
And the fish were locked
in solid ice.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:35.117
And a blast of icy wind...

01:06:35.284 --> 01:06:38.412
signaled the start of a winter storm.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:41.165
It looked bad for Otis.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:44.751
The wind was stinging his face
like needles.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:46.837
His paws were numb from the cold.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:51.758
He was beaten down by the storm.
He had to rest.

01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:54.761
Almost frozen...

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:59.975
Otis laid down in the snow,
ready to give up.

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:05.105
But then he began thinking
about Sondra and the puppies.

01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:09.860
They were waiting for him back
in the cave, depending on him.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:17.701
What would happen to them
if he never returned?

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.833
And Otis...
Otis felt his strength renewed.

01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:27.336
He forced himself up on his paws...

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.505
knowing that he had to
go on for Sondra...

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:36.094
for the puppies,
for dogs everywhere!

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:46.230
The storm finally died down,
but Otis had no idea where he was.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.108
Then in the distance,
he saw a sign of hope.

01:07:57.324 --> 01:08:01.703
He barked loudly to announce
that there was a hungry dog outside.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.208
And a familiar form
appeared in the window.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:09.544
"Look what the blizzard blew in,"
Milo said.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.713
"You look hungry.
How about some fish?"

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.591
"Okay, but not for me.
For my puppies."

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.468
"You have puppies? Me too."

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.011
"You have what?"

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:21.932
"I mean kittens," Milo yelled.

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:28.479
Otis knew his family
would love to have these fish...

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:31.358
but how was he going to
reach them way up there?

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:44.705
Milo had it all worked out.

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:03.515
"Hey, Otis."

01:09:06.727 --> 01:09:08.854
"I've really missed you."

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:13.191
So Milo and Otis
made an agreement.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:16.528
They'd meet in the spring
with their families...

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:20.741
and all together
they'd travel back to the farm.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:44.765
And spring wasn't that far off.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:21.760
On the first warm day,
just as planned...

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:24.763
Milo brought out his new family.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.682
And they waited for Otis.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:59.172
Otis was having a little trouble
getting his puppies organized.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:01.591
And on this glorious spring day...

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.302
a|| the animals
all around the countryside...

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:08.640
were bringing their young
out into the sunshine.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:12.018
The fox who hid the muskrat
now had a cub.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:15.147
And so, of course, did the raccoon
who stole the fish.

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:18.692
And the deer was teaching
her fawn to frolic.

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:27.033
And Milo and Joyce
had their kittens.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:39.337
Finally, Otis arrived...

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:43.216
and the two families
saw each other for the first time.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:48.555
At first, they were a little...

01:11:49.181 --> 01:11:50.724
<i>__.shy-</i>

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.027
But then...

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:05.989
Otis led the charge, and the puppies
ran towards the kittens...

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:08.950
eager to meet the cats
they'd heard so much about.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.828
"This is your Uncle Milo,"
Otis said to his puppies.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.706
"The one you pulled out
of the pit?" Francois asked.

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:18.710
And all the puppies and kittens
began to get to know each other.

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:24.007
"You're a strange-looking dog,"
Suzette said to Milo, Jr.

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.718
"You're dogs, we're cats,"
he replied.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:29.888
Then Otis barked, "Hey! Hey!"

01:12:30.055 --> 01:12:32.432
Hey! All right, everyone quiet.

01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:35.310
"Quiet!"

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:40.106
And after the whole group
was gathered together...

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:43.527
Milo and Otis
led the way down the road.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:47.531
The road that would take them to the
place where their lives had begun.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:52.285
The road that would
take them home.
