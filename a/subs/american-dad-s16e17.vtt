WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:05.088
Why do we have a damn bell?

00:05.171 --> 00:06.965
This is a college!

00:07.632 --> 00:08.633
Sorry I'm late.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.761
The dean is getting his ass kicked
in the parking lot.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.473
It's so messed up.
Nobody is stopping to help.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.560
Yeesh.
So this is old Corpsey herself, huh?

00:18.643 --> 00:19.644
Ugh!

00:19.728 --> 00:21.396
What'd, they leave her out in the sun?

00:21.479 --> 00:22.981
Aah!

00:23.064 --> 00:25.525
Oh, I didn't miss anything, did I?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.610
I was just trying
to catch a little catnap

00:27.694 --> 00:29.070
before class started.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.448
G-G-G-G-G-Going on is what?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.033
Hayley, this is our new lab partner.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.534
She's a SNAB.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.870
A Student of Notable Age or Background.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.621
And her name's Anus.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.457
Eunice.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.751
Yahh!

00:42.834 --> 00:44.419
Dammit!

00:44.502 --> 00:49.007
Wow. 98 years old,
and you're going back to college.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.551
You're never too old
to follow your dreams.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.970
I find that so inspiring.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.890
I'll tell you what I find inspiring.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.434
The student bodies.

01:01.186 --> 01:04.272
Sweet Georgia Brown.

01:04.355 --> 01:08.026
I happen to have an interest
in the fellas and the gals.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.987
Damn, old lady!

01:26.836 --> 01:29.422
Ooh, ooh, and another thing
about my new friend Eunice...

01:29.506 --> 01:32.217
another thing is, she is so funny.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.135
Check out this hilarious picture of us

01:34.219 --> 01:35.970
pretending to hump
the tope-liary animals

01:36.054 --> 01:37.847
out front of the Women's Center.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.519
You didn't tell us
she was an old age person.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.313
Barf City,
population no thank you.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.983
Now, Francine,
I too was once put off by old people,

01:49.067 --> 01:52.737
but then I had an adventure about them
that changed my mind.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.988
I'm always having adventures

01:54.072 --> 01:56.407
and learning life-changing lessons
from them.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.661
This week, I'm converting
our mud room into a man cave.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.372
I wonder what I'll learn from that.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.875
Well, I say, "Go young or go home."

02:05.959 --> 02:07.293
No old-o.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.672
Well, I think Eunice is
a deeply inspirational SNAB.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.341
And I hope I'm just like her
when I get old.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.761
Oh, you're not going
to be like Eunice.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.472
You're going to be like... your mom.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.015
Pff. Sha-yeah-hah right.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.559
It's fate.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.936
Every woman eventually
becomes her mother.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.813
-Will I become my mother?
-No.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.399
Every man marries his mother.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.650
Noice.

02:30.733 --> 02:33.987
Hayley, think of all the ways
you're already like Francine.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.114
Laid-back, except
for quick bursts of anger.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.448
Lazy.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.033
Heavy substance abuse.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.368
For you, weed.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.912
For Francine, collectible
Guardians of the Galaxy

02:42.996 --> 02:44.706
Big Gulp cups full of white wine.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.292
You should consider
yourself lucky, Hayley.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.295
This is Francine
we're talking about here.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.671
I'm an icon.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.673
I'm sorry, but me become like you?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.133
Gross.

02:55.216 --> 02:58.511
It's like, Barf City,
population no thank you.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.096
Oh, see, right there?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.764
Francine just said that
like two minutes ago!

03:01.848 --> 03:03.266
- No, she didn't.
- Barf City,

03:03.349 --> 03:05.101
population no thank you.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.020
Roger, why were you recording us?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.855
I'm recording everything these days.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.982
I'm afraid the political atmosphere

03:11.065 --> 03:13.568
inside my improv team,
Pizza Party Weekend,

03:13.651 --> 03:15.612
has me... a bit paranoid.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.155
There's snakes in the grass.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
Certain members want me out.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.826
-Which ones?
-All of them. Every single one of them.

03:22.368 --> 03:26.456
Well, Hayley, too bad for you
that you're gonna end up being like me,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.833
whether you like it or not.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.794
Now, I see it's time
for my 10:00 a.m. nap, so...

03:31.878 --> 03:36.049
Ugh! Here comes another one
of your obnoxious little sayings.

03:36.132 --> 03:41.471
Give Momma some sugar
so she can have them sweet dreams.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.057
Ugh! Barfsylvania...

03:44.140 --> 03:46.559
Population nothankyula.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.645
Aah!

03:57.570 --> 04:00.740
Oh! You don't have
a big squiggly mustache!

04:00.823 --> 04:02.909
For the last time, Jeff,
we are listing the ways

04:02.992 --> 04:05.662
I am different from my mom,
not Wario.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.372
Oh, Hayley!

04:07.455 --> 04:10.208
Looky what I found
in the old picture album.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.543
You can barely tell us apart.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.504
Yeah, only because
you were always trying

04:14.587 --> 04:17.423
to make me a frilly, princessy
little clone of yourself.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.177
Oh, excuse me for ever trying
to bond with my daughter.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.137
Bond? Ha!

04:23.221 --> 04:25.098
You just wanted
your own personal Mini-Me.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.225
Like that Halloween
that you went as Mini-Me

04:27.308 --> 04:28.977
and you made me go
as Mini-Mini-Me.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.231
But I didn't wanna be Mini-Me.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.899
I wanted
to be Minnie Mouse.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.985
Or at least Mini-Minnie Mouse.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.445
But that's what Dad and Steve
got to go as!

04:41.114 --> 04:42.407
But it's okay.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.034
Because I couldn't be
more different from you.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.369
Oh, yeah?

04:46.452 --> 04:49.163
Why don't you check
my old senior picture?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.916
You...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.501
wore a headband, too?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.295
Face it, Hayley.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.964
There's too much of me in you already.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.465
My genes.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.925
My cooking.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.011
My double-jointedness.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.470
You're double-jointed?

05:04.554 --> 05:05.638
Yes.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
And so are you!

05:11.102 --> 05:14.480
Toodle-oo, Future Me!

05:14.564 --> 05:19.235
Well, Steve, through ruthless cunning,
I seized control of Pizza Party Weekend

05:19.319 --> 05:20.862
and fired all the other members.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.281
Had to be done.
It was a nest of vipers.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.783
A den of... vipers.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.077
Plus, none of them
could do characters for crap.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.121
But now I gotta find
a whole new team!

05:30.204 --> 05:31.998
What about me and my friends?

05:32.081 --> 05:36.753
Our drunk driving skit got big laughs
at the pre-prom assembly last year.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.463
Hmm. How was the prom?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.756
It was a bloodbath.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.174
Drunk driving was way up.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.717
I don't know.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.385
Maybe we could do a trial practice,

05:44.469 --> 05:46.804
test the chemistry,
play a little Splooch Magooch.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.724
-What's that?
-Classic improv warm-up game.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.934
You don't know Splooch Magooch?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.436
Oh, my God.
This is not gonna work.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.812
No way. But I'm up against it.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.189
You're in. All of you.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.232
Full member status.
Welcome to the big leagues.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.109
We practice in a public park.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.528
Gotta get rid of my headbands.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.614
No, wait! Mom got rid of hers!

06:04.697 --> 06:06.324
But does that mean
I need to keep mine?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.326
CannisterCo?

06:08.409 --> 06:09.994
That's Mom's brand!

06:13.539 --> 06:16.084
Babe? Are you all right?

06:16.167 --> 06:19.670
No, Jeff! I am definitely not
all right!

06:19.754 --> 06:21.798
I have to get rid of anything
related to my mom!

06:21.881 --> 06:23.383
What about that dress?

06:42.026 --> 06:44.904
I hereby sentence you to become...

06:44.987 --> 06:47.865
your mother!

06:51.077 --> 06:54.205
If you just had a nightmare,
please don't tell me about it.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.416
No need for both of us
to get scared.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.793
Wait a minute. That's it.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.546
A way I'm not anything like my mom.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.922
You.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.799
Oh, she would never marry
someone like you.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.426
Almost nobody would.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.927
Ah, thanks, babe.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.805
I'm not becoming my mother.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.306
I'm glad, too.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.977
No offense, but being married to Mrs. S?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.647
Barf City,
population no thank you.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.483
Laid-back except
for quick bursts of anger.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.987
Why is this mother-
Junior Jumble so hard?

07:26.070 --> 07:27.697
- Gaah!
- Lazy.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.906
Oh, man.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.826
I sure am tired
from that quick burst of anger.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.536
Heavy substance abuse.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.249
Oh, my God.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.209
I'm not becoming my mother.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.419
I married her.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.880
Now, give Momma some sugar

07:43.963 --> 07:46.841
so she can
have them sweet dreams.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.984
Mrs. S, can I sleep with
you and Mr. S tonight?

08:05.067 --> 08:07.778
Hayley realized
it's actually me who's like you,

08:07.862 --> 08:09.947
and now she's madder than Wario!

08:12.575 --> 08:15.703
It's you who's like me, huh?

08:18.956 --> 08:20.374
Aren't you happy?

08:20.458 --> 08:22.335
You're not going to become your mom.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.505
Yeah, but I sure as hell don't want
to be married to her, either.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.549
Jeff needs to be de-Francine-ified.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.929
Starting with those
beloved golden locks of his.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.056
-Say, where is Jeff?
-No idea.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.643
I've been working like a dog
on my man-cave all morning.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.311
That's right. I'm still doing that.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.940
Brother, I need to hydrate.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.820
Oh, hey there.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.658
We just got back from
the most amazing girls' day out.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.786
Look, babe!
We got mani-ped-a-files!

08:56.869 --> 08:58.871
You're just doing this
to get back at me, aren't you?

08:58.955 --> 09:01.624
Actually, Hayley, maybe I'm just happy

09:01.707 --> 09:05.586
to finally have a "daughter"
who wants to do things with me.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.296
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.090
My study group got moved up to noon.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.424
Eunice sent me a text.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.302
On what? A telegraph?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.180
No, Francine, on her phone.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.433
Which she did mail to me
in an envelope.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.977
I gotta get this back to her.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.693
Splooch Magooch,
there's a monkey in my cooch,

09:28.776 --> 09:31.445
and he came out to give me a...

09:31.529 --> 09:33.030
And then, Barry, bud, you say

09:33.114 --> 09:35.533
an adjective and noun
that start with "A".

09:35.616 --> 09:36.659
Whatever pops into your head.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.869
Don't worry about trying to be funny.
Doesn't have to be funny.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.580
Angry apple.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.041
How is that funny? I...
Oh, my God, we are so screwed.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.919
Now, if I'm up next,
for example, and I've got "B",

09:47.003 --> 09:49.213
I'm just gonna fire off
something super funny, like...

09:55.344 --> 09:57.138
How about Bronx banana?

09:57.221 --> 10:01.267
Heh. You know, like a...
like a tough New Yawk banana?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.603
Like, "'Ey, I'm peelin' here!"

10:06.105 --> 10:07.315
"You peelin' to me?"

10:07.398 --> 10:10.401
All right.
That's more like it.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.778
There may be hope for us yet.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.117
Looks like we got ourselves
a funnyman here.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.620
Okay, Steve, you think
you can push me out?

10:20.703 --> 10:21.829
Game on.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.415
Mr. Steve's Uncle, sir?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.711
What should I do here?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.671
Well, whatever you do, don't blow him.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.965
He just keeps coming back
again and again.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.345
Wow, Eunice.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.139
Look at all these
incredible things you've done.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.016
Professional female wrestling,

10:42.099 --> 10:44.644
fighting alongside Jane Fonda
and the Viet Cong,

10:44.727 --> 10:48.272
founding member of
the Shangri-Las and Buckcherry,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.816
hang-gliding, bang-gliding.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.819
How did you make such
an amazing life for yourself?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.864
I decided early on
I wanted an exciting life.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.699
My own life.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.203
So, I left home at 12. Cut all ties.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.205
It had to be done.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.666
I didn't want to be anything
like my parents.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.793
-Are you?
-Heavens no.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.630
And neither, for that matter,
is Milford, my husband.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.131
Husband?

11:14.215 --> 11:19.261
Any of you study buddies call
for an old fuddy duddy?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.389
Ha!

11:21.472 --> 11:23.766
That's us in our younger days.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.227
But you are only ever
as old as you feel.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.397
Milford here is 102
and still sharp as a tack.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.023
That's right.

11:31.107 --> 11:35.861
Well, I'm off to the lab
to play tiddlywinks with Morbo.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.863
Goodbye, Constance!

11:44.036 --> 11:46.122
I take two steps forward

11:46.288 --> 11:48.457
And I do, too

11:48.541 --> 11:50.418
We stay together

11:50.501 --> 11:53.003
'Cause I am just like you

11:53.087 --> 11:58.092
Give your momma some sugar
so we can have them sweet dreams!

11:58.175 --> 11:59.969
No!

12:00.052 --> 12:03.389
Your personality is not
going to dictate who I am!

12:03.472 --> 12:04.890
Or who I'm with!

12:04.974 --> 12:07.810
Ah don't want your life!

12:07.893 --> 12:10.896
And ah don't want your wife!

12:10.980 --> 12:14.024
I am cutting all ties with you!
Forever!

12:15.860 --> 12:17.903
All right.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.240
Next up, we got Tuttle
with "Magic Stick".

12:21.323 --> 12:23.117
Pizza Party Weekenders!

12:23.200 --> 12:25.703
Some of you have expressed,
both to me directly

12:25.786 --> 12:28.038
and to one another
in private phone calls,

12:28.122 --> 12:30.166
concerns about my "mental state"

12:30.249 --> 12:34.170
and how hard I've been
riding our rising star here,

12:34.253 --> 12:37.256
so I just wanted you to know
that Steve and I had a good talk

12:37.339 --> 12:39.717
and, well, he agrees, and I do, too,

12:39.800 --> 12:42.094
-that he's out of the group.
-What?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.054
Can't be trusted.
He's out. Steve's out.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.265
And Buck-Knife Joe is in.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.142
Are you sure that's a good idea?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.978
Look, Buck-Knife Joe might
have a knife around his neck,

12:51.061 --> 12:52.480
but you know
what he doesn't have?

12:52.563 --> 12:53.898
An agenda.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.650
Now, let's have some fun,
you buncha damn Judases!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.281
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.283
I-I-I just didn't know
where else to go.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.243
That's all right, dear.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.038
You just go on and get yourself
out of those wet clothes.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.040
You can borrow some of ours.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.210
Don't worry!
You're not going to be your mother!

13:14.293 --> 13:17.171
And neither is your husband!

13:17.254 --> 13:21.342
Because you and your husband
are going to be...

13:21.425 --> 13:22.551
us.

13:43.697 --> 13:47.535
Oh, it seems like I saw something
I'm not supposed to,

13:47.618 --> 13:48.702
but rest assured,

13:48.786 --> 13:51.789
I have absolutely no idea
what's happening.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.083
Please, do go on.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.056
Yo, U-Dog,
you sure you don't mind us

14:09.139 --> 14:11.809
wearing your fancy
old threads, kemosabe?

14:11.892 --> 14:14.645
Oh, not at all, dear.

14:14.728 --> 14:19.233
My, don't they just fit you perfectly.

14:20.484 --> 14:24.071
Ugh! Do you have any other tattoos
I should know about?

14:24.154 --> 14:27.241
I got a Jill Stein riding
a surfboard on my upper thigh,

14:27.324 --> 14:29.368
but it's usually
covered up with pubes.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.953
Wait. Why?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.540
That's enough damn pecan sandies!
They'll go straight to my...

14:34.623 --> 14:37.376
Eh, your calves.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.588
Ba-duh!

14:40.671 --> 14:42.423
Mom?

14:42.506 --> 14:45.134
I thought you convinced the girl
to cut all ties!

14:45.217 --> 14:46.552
I did!

14:46.635 --> 14:49.096
-What do you want?
-My daughter.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.431
Well, I am not coming back with you.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.433
Not you! Jeff.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.978
Well, he's not going anywhere.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.689
Actually, none of us are
until this storm lets up.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.858
Road's flooded.
Just barely made it up here.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.443
Yo, Milhouse, this the shitter?

15:02.526 --> 15:04.528
I had a chalupa or two
on the drive over.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.406
What the...

15:15.164 --> 15:18.500
Oh. My. God.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.044
Sweet man cave!

15:20.127 --> 15:21.629
Love the mad scientist theme.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.380
Beakman's World!

15:23.464 --> 15:27.051
And I bet the secret entrance keeps
the wife out on game day, am I right?

15:28.719 --> 15:30.095
Holy moly!

15:30.179 --> 15:31.889
Can you smoke a brisket
in this baby?

15:31.972 --> 15:34.475
What is this, Sears? How much
this puppy put you back?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.518
What you got going here?
Brewski fridge?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.562
You know,
all this place really needs is

15:38.646 --> 15:40.648
chili pepper lights everywhere,
and then right there...

15:44.693 --> 15:47.363
And then right there,
Spuds MacKenzie poster.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.156
Hold up.
I got like 10 in the car.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.409
Cool dress, Hayley.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.204
I love how it does
absolutely nothing for you.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.207
Says the woman who dresses
like the pink ghost from Pac-Man.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.583
Enough!

15:59.667 --> 16:03.545
I cannot stand the inane prattling
of you two trifling fools any longer!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.506
I'm not Eunice.

16:05.589 --> 16:09.385
I'm Dr. Constance Von Stroheim!

16:09.468 --> 16:10.886
And with my husband,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.514
I've discovered the key
to eternal life.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.684
And you shall be our vessels!

16:16.767 --> 16:19.311
Morbo!

16:22.523 --> 16:23.857
What's a Morbo?

16:28.362 --> 16:30.906
Seize them, you stupid brute!

16:39.623 --> 16:41.875
Wow. Biggest turnout ever.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.544
I know things got
a little bumpy there

16:43.627 --> 16:45.254
for a little while,
but I think we came out

16:45.337 --> 16:47.089
the other end
all the stronger for it.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.883
Now, why don't we warm up
with a little Vroom Zoom Kaboom?

16:49.967 --> 16:50.968
Vroom.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.302
-Zoom.
-You're out.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.512
You're all out. I'm sorry.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.848
I-I just can't work with people
I can't trust.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.058
Buck-Knife Joe has some friends.
They're in.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.476
No time to practice,
so we'll just have

16:59.560 --> 17:00.978
to do warm-up games for the show.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.358
Splooch Magooch,
there's a monkey in my cooch,

17:06.442 --> 17:09.611
and he came out to give me a...

17:09.695 --> 17:11.572
Big surprise!

17:11.655 --> 17:15.284
The original members
of Pizza Party Weekend?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.578
Can't do characters, can we?

17:17.661 --> 17:20.497
Well, now that we have
a majority again,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.583
you are out!

17:25.794 --> 17:28.714
The lesson from this adventure is clear.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.758
I'm just too trusting.

17:33.343 --> 17:37.222
So, the hubby called an audible,
and for the time being,

17:37.306 --> 17:40.684
he will be taking the body
of your vivacious mother here.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.770
-Ow!
-And we decided to use

17:42.853 --> 17:45.981
Jeff's body for the brain
of our beloved cat,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.358
Mr. Poopie.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.237
And what have you done with Stan...
you nutcase?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.031
Oh, nothing too bad.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.909
I crushed up an allergy pill
into his malt liquor.

17:56.992 --> 18:00.704
He's sleeping like a little angel
on the upstairs Davenport.

18:04.875 --> 18:09.797
Get your filthy hands off my body,
you putrid oaf!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.381
This will just take a sec.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.886
I shouldn't have
taken off with Jeff like that.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.680
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come here,
and you'd be safe.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.643
Oh, Hayley,
I didn't really come for Jeff.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.436
I came to meet Eunice.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.938
What? Why?

18:26.021 --> 18:30.776
Because you seem to want
to follow in her footsteps so much.

18:30.859 --> 18:35.030
I really never did want you
to be just like me.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.992
But I did wanna be someone
you'd want to be like.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.578
Oh, Mom. You are.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.580
There's a lot of things about me...

18:43.664 --> 18:45.666
that I'm glad I got from you.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.711
Oof. Arm's cramping
from all that whipping.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.631
What a putrid oaf, right?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.134
Anywho, time to make some space

18:55.217 --> 18:59.555
in those pretty heads
for our beautiful minds.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.688
Hold hands... while we die?

19:07.771 --> 19:09.898
Can't. Strapped down.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.525
Yes, you can.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.444
You're... double-jointed.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.946
Oh, yeah.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.783
Oh, yeah!

19:32.087 --> 19:34.298
Mom, wake up! Let's go!

19:34.381 --> 19:37.718
Morbo, you beastly fool!
Attack!

19:41.471 --> 19:45.309
Morbo! What the hell?
Why do you do what she says?

19:45.392 --> 19:47.311
Seriously.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.521
Ha-ha! Very funny.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.733
But Morbo not "whipped", okay?

19:52.816 --> 19:56.820
Morbo, you're quite literally whipped,
like all the time.

19:56.904 --> 20:01.366
What are you waiting for,
you stupid, hideous fiend?

20:01.491 --> 20:02.784
Get them!

20:10.125 --> 20:11.251
Wha...?

20:14.171 --> 20:15.964
Mom, listen. I'm so...

20:16.089 --> 20:18.175
Hayley, excuse me,
but I had a crazy dream

20:18.258 --> 20:19.968
just now that made me
realize something.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.721
I should be spending time
with my family,

20:22.804 --> 20:24.765
not hiding away from them
in a cave.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.183
-Dad, that's not what we...
-Hold on.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.977
Wanna get Steve on speaker for this, too.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.103
Hey, Dad, what's up?

20:30.187 --> 20:33.941
I see now that a cave
is a place for a bear, not a man.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.777
The only kind of cave
I want to be in from now on

20:36.860 --> 20:39.613
is a family cave.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.491
Well, your father just
cracked open another 40,

20:42.574 --> 20:44.701
so guess I'm driving.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.370
You want to follow me home?

20:46.453 --> 20:48.872
I wouldn't have it
any other way, Mom.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.221
Bye! Have a great time!
