06:50.620 --> 06:51.620
How are you?

06:54.980 --> 06:57.140
Didn't we just talk about that?

06:58.900 --> 06:59.940
That was yesterday.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.100
Today is Tuesday.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.740
So I've been here long?

07:11.620 --> 07:12.620
A month.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.460
Wayne says that

07:20.820 --> 07:23.620
my grief pattern is atypical.

07:28.660 --> 07:29.660
Yeah.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.740
Gotta talk with Wayne.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.260
I think he gives you too much medication,
way too much.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.260
Stop it, please.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.300
Trust others to be smarter than you.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.420
He's straight out of medical school,
he don't know what he's doing.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.220
I've treated ten times
as many patients as he has.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.060
But you're not a doctor.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.580
No, I'm not.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.660
And I'm proud that I'm not
when I meet a doctor like him.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.220
There is nothing atypical about your grief.

08:19.780 --> 08:21.180
It was my fault.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.380
What about me?

08:26.020 --> 08:27.020
I was there, too.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.980
I could have stopped him.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.700
No.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.580
You didn't know that he
started waking up lately.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.780
I was aware that he would sometimes

08:46.660 --> 08:47.660
wake up

08:49.860 --> 08:51.620
and crawl out of bed...

08:52.780 --> 08:53.860
and walk about...

08:56.100 --> 08:58.780
just as you thought
that he was soundly asleep.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.620
He could open the baby gate.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.140
He...

09:05.620 --> 09:06.620
He woke up...

09:10.540 --> 09:13.820
and... was confused...

09:21.900 --> 09:22.900
Hey!

09:43.980 --> 09:45.700
Dr. Wayne says he wants me back home.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.940
You couldn't leave it, could you?

09:52.340 --> 09:53.540
You had to meddle.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.980
This place leads nowhere.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.420
On the contrary.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.180
Grief...

10:02.540 --> 10:03.820
It's not a disease,

10:03.860 --> 10:05.860
it's a natural, healthy reaction.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.780
You can't just remove it, you mustn't.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.620
Wayne knows you're a therapist.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.860
He says you shouldn't treat your own family.

10:15.540 --> 10:16.940
In principle I agree, but...

10:17.940 --> 10:21.300
But you're just so much smarter, aren't you?

10:23.140 --> 10:24.180
I love you.

10:27.380 --> 10:30.060
Nothing hurts more than
to see the one that you love

10:31.100 --> 10:33.100
subjected to mistakes and wrongs.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.740
No therapist can know
as much about you as I do.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.060
- It hurts.
- I know.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.460
There's no way around it.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.820
I want to talk to -

13:04.980 --> 13:06.820
I'm not gonna let you do that.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.940
Will it just go on and on?

13:14.540 --> 13:17.180
No. No, it'll change.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.580
Will it get any worse?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.700
Yes, it will.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.500
You've always been distant from me and Nick.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.220
Ever I come to think of it...

13:54.180 --> 13:55.540
very, very distant.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.820
Okay.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.740
Can you give me some examples from this?

14:04.940 --> 14:06.940
Hell, that's not that difficult
to understand.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.940
Last summer, for instance...

14:16.020 --> 14:17.700
You were terribly distant last summer.

14:20.340 --> 14:23.140
As a father, and as a husband.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.420
And that was Nick's last summer

14:26.620 --> 14:27.620
you missed that on.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.260
Too bad.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.340
I never interested you...

14:37.460 --> 14:38.500
until now...

14:39.780 --> 14:40.900
that I'm your patient.

14:43.580 --> 14:46.140
Perhaps I'm not supposed to
talk about these things.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.740
There is nothing you can't talk about.

14:52.660 --> 14:55.820
You're indifferent to whether
your child is alive or dead.

15:04.180 --> 15:08.580
I bet you have a lot of clever
therapist replies to that, haven't you?

15:14.180 --> 15:15.180
Well, actually...

15:17.380 --> 15:19.300
it was to honor your wish.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.300
You wanted peace to write.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.140
Perhaps I didn't mean it.

15:25.860 --> 15:27.060
What I understood...

15:28.860 --> 15:30.420
is that you wanted to write alone.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.860
That you and Nick were going to go to Eden,

15:34.180 --> 15:35.140
just the two of you.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.100
That way, you could finish your thesis.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.260
But I didn't.

15:44.380 --> 15:45.380
You didn't?

15:46.260 --> 15:47.260
You see?

15:47.860 --> 15:48.900
You didn't even know that.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.460
Why did you give up? That's not like you.

15:51.940 --> 15:54.980
The whole project just seemed
less important up there.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.980
As you said,
when I had told you about my subject:

15:59.740 --> 16:00.740
"Glib".

16:01.300 --> 16:02.780
I never called your subject "glib".

16:03.740 --> 16:05.820
Perhaps you didn't use that word,
but that's what you meant.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.100
And all of a sudden, it was glib.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.220
Or even was some, some kind of lie.

16:15.940 --> 16:16.980
I see.

16:18.260 --> 16:19.220
No, you don't see.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.740
You see a lot of things, but not that.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.100
Inhale. On a count of five...

17:55.900 --> 17:57.220
call me, call me.

17:57.380 --> 18:02.100
Just... follow me, do it with me. Inhale.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.580
Inhale, on a count to five...

18:06.500 --> 18:08.740
Inhale. Two...

18:13.020 --> 18:16.500
Stay with me, stay with me.
I'm gonna teach you how to breathe.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.180
Inhale.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.580
2, 3, 4, 5, hold.

18:24.060 --> 18:27.940
2, 3, 4, 5, exhale.

18:27.980 --> 18:29.740
2, 3, 4- good.

18:29.860 --> 18:30.860
Imagine,

18:31.300 --> 18:35.700
imagine you're blowing
on your thistle plumes...

18:36.340 --> 18:37.820
calmly, quietly...

18:41.220 --> 18:44.500
Yes, yes, that's good. That's good.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.020
That's very good.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.620
I told you there would be a change.

18:54.860 --> 18:57.180
You're still mourning
but you're in a new phase.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.420
What phase?

19:04.420 --> 19:05.420
Anxiety.

19:07.540 --> 19:08.500
Anxiety?

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
Yes.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.700
This is physical.

19:15.620 --> 19:16.740
It's dangerous.

19:16.820 --> 19:17.940
No, it's not dangerous.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.540
Just as your grief wasn't dangerous.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.620
A main part of anxiety is physical:

19:26.020 --> 19:27.260
Dizzy spells,

19:28.260 --> 19:29.260
dry mouth,

19:30.220 --> 19:31.700
distorted hearing,

19:32.100 --> 19:33.060
trembling,

19:33.380 --> 19:34.820
heavy breathing,

19:34.900 --> 19:36.100
fast pulse,

19:36.380 --> 19:37.380
nausea...

19:47.860 --> 19:48.900
Hey!

19:55.340 --> 19:56.340
Easy.

19:56.340 --> 19:57.860
Never screw your therapist.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.180
No matter how much
your therapist may like it.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.460
I know it distracts you, but

20:06.340 --> 20:07.340
it's not good for us.

20:07.780 --> 20:08.780
Do the breathing.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.620
Hold...

20:14.740 --> 20:15.740
Exhale.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.100
Do you love me?

20:19.180 --> 20:20.180
Yes, I do.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.220
Then help me.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.460
It's what I'm doing.

20:37.260 --> 20:41.660
Exposure - that's the only thing
that really works.

20:42.780 --> 20:45.380
Everything else is... just talk.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.900
You have to have the courage to stay
in the situation that frightens you.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.340
And then you'll learn
that fear isn't dangerous.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.900
Let's make a list of things
you're afraid of.

21:00.340 --> 21:03.100
At the top, you put the situation
you fear the most.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.860
But I don't know what I'm afraid of.

21:13.660 --> 21:16.660
Just... take your time.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.420
I'm thinking.

21:19.860 --> 21:20.860
Okay.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.860
I'm thinking, but...

21:31.620 --> 21:34.900
Can't I just be afraid
without a definite object?

22:33.580 --> 22:34.580
No, no!

23:17.460 --> 23:19.100
This won't do.

23:23.420 --> 23:25.700
Stupe, stupidest thing I could do to you.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.540
If you can't tell me...

23:34.260 --> 23:35.580
what you're afraid of,

23:36.020 --> 23:38.020
maybe it would be easier for you to tell me

23:38.380 --> 23:39.740
where you're afraid?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.820
Where would you feel most exposed?

23:45.300 --> 23:46.500
What would be the worst place?

23:49.780 --> 23:50.900
An apartment?

23:55.700 --> 23:56.740
The street?

23:58.060 --> 23:59.060
A store?

24:01.860 --> 24:02.860
The park?

24:06.780 --> 24:07.980
Visiting someone, maybe.

24:20.140 --> 24:21.340
The woods.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.340
The woods?

24:29.060 --> 24:30.020
The woods, yes.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.780
It's funny because

24:31.980 --> 24:34.580
you were the one that always wanted
to go to the woods.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.580
What scares you about the woods?

24:40.100 --> 24:42.060
What frightens you... there?

24:46.820 --> 24:47.860
Everything.

24:54.420 --> 24:57.180
Tell me what you think
is supposed to happen in the woods.

25:04.780 --> 25:05.780
Eh?

25:08.260 --> 25:09.860
Is it any woods in particular?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.100
Eden.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.620
Eden?

25:24.820 --> 25:26.940
What do you say we put...

25:28.300 --> 25:32.100
a garden around Eden,
at the top of the pyramid?

25:34.260 --> 25:37.540
No... Not quite at the top.

25:48.940 --> 25:49.940
No.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.260
Stop it.

25:59.540 --> 26:00.580
Okay.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.460
It's, it's okay.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.460
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.780
I don't know.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.780
We can start by working on
your expectations.

27:05.260 --> 27:06.420
Close your eyes.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.060
Feel the seat underneath you.

27:16.780 --> 27:19.180
Feel yourself sinking down into it...

27:20.500 --> 27:21.580
enfolding you...

27:23.460 --> 27:24.380
It's a nice feeling.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.340
What you feel is a pleasant warmth...

27:30.220 --> 27:31.420
and heaviness.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.100
Your breath is deep...

27:38.060 --> 27:42.460
Regular... easing.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.180
Now...

27:45.780 --> 27:47.020
Imagine you're at Eden.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.860
Imagine you arrived
at Eden through the woods.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.060
Tell me what you see.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.300
I'm at the bridge.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.100
It's evening.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.660
Almost no birds can be heard.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.900
The water is running without a sound.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.460
Darkness comes out anytime here.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.460
I walk into it.

28:39.380 --> 28:44.540
The little deers... are hiding,
among the ferns. As usual.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.820
Is it difficult to walk there?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.980
No. Not really.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.820
In fact, it's almost okay.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.340
In among the trees,

29:09.620 --> 29:10.540
on the slope,

29:12.460 --> 29:14.060
there's a? foxhole.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.460
How do you feel there?

29:22.940 --> 29:23.980
I can't really tell.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.500
It should be easy, passing.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.660
And yet,

29:31.740 --> 29:33.540
it's like walking through mud.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.380
The trunk is thick.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.580
The tree rots so slowly.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.980
It has some strange kind of personality.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.180
I've always found that.

30:05.820 --> 30:06.900
Now...

30:08.740 --> 30:11.420
Where are you, are you,
are you heading for the cabin?

30:14.620 --> 30:15.660
Yes, I am.

30:19.380 --> 30:23.580
I'm walking up the path
through the tall grass.

30:23.940 --> 30:24.940
Then don't go in.

30:26.020 --> 30:26.940
Don't go in.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.460
It's the outside you're afraid of.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.620
Don't look around.

30:32.820 --> 30:33.980
No.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.540
Lie down on the green.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.340
You want me to lie down?

30:41.540 --> 30:43.060
Lie down on the grass.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.220
On top of all the plants?

30:48.260 --> 30:49.940
Yes, lie down on the plants.

31:04.180 --> 31:05.140
Are you lying down?

31:07.260 --> 31:08.180
Yes.

31:10.180 --> 31:11.100
Good.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.220
What is everything like around you?

31:16.140 --> 31:17.100
Green.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.100
It's all very green.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.620
Good.

31:25.820 --> 31:27.580
Now will you do what I ask you?

31:30.260 --> 31:31.100
Yes.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.340
What do you want me to do?

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
I want you...

31:38.580 --> 31:40.380
to melt into the green.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.300
Don't fight it.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.420
Just - turn - green.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.140
No matter what happens:
You were there. You did it.

32:02.460 --> 32:04.340
Let fear come, if it likes.

32:04.900 --> 32:08.900
Remember: what the mind can
conceive and believe, it can achieve.

33:00.540 --> 33:01.500
What's wrong?

33:02.380 --> 33:03.500
Ground is burning.

33:04.660 --> 33:06.140
The ground is not burning.

33:11.740 --> 33:12.660
Gotta go.

33:32.580 --> 33:35.580
I want to lie down, just for a minute.

33:38.420 --> 33:39.380
Sure.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.620
Yeah, we'll take a rest.

36:10.860 --> 36:11.900
Shouldn't we go home?

36:19.140 --> 36:20.180
Yeah.

36:22.340 --> 36:23.300
Yeah, we should.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.660
Slowly...

37:34.060 --> 37:35.060
Stay with it.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.100
I know it hurts.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.580
Stay! Stay in there!

40:49.660 --> 40:52.020
It's just the stupid acorns.

42:21.420 --> 42:22.380
What are you doing?

42:23.340 --> 42:24.260
I'm just...

42:25.940 --> 42:28.940
setting up a little exercise.

42:30.460 --> 42:32.740
It's... it's like a...

42:35.060 --> 42:36.220
It's like a game.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.780
You cheated me yesterday.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.220
Running is not good.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.860
You have to really feel the grass.

42:44.220 --> 42:45.700
I want you to go from this stone...

42:47.740 --> 42:48.980
to this stone.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.100
Pretty scary, huh?

42:53.500 --> 42:54.420
You're ready?

42:56.020 --> 42:56.980
Yeah.

42:57.940 --> 42:58.900
I'll give you a ride.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.220
I'll put you on the first stone.

43:05.140 --> 43:06.620
Stay with me.

43:08.140 --> 43:08.940
Here we go.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.060
Now put your foot down. I got you.

43:11.580 --> 43:13.300
I got you. I'm right here.

43:14.060 --> 43:15.100
I can't do this.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.340
Yes, you can.

43:16.980 --> 43:19.940
You can and you will. Just like I will.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.940
We're gonna walk together.

43:22.220 --> 43:24.700
We're gonna walk together, okay? Now...

43:25.140 --> 43:26.700
Alright now, breathe.

43:27.420 --> 43:28.700
Let's step off the rock.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.260
And step on that grass.

43:32.260 --> 43:33.140
Step down.

43:33.660 --> 43:36.020
See? What happened?

43:36.340 --> 43:38.380
Keep breathing. Keep, keep breathing.

43:38.420 --> 43:40.100
I've got you.

43:40.100 --> 43:41.740
You're really doing great.

43:41.740 --> 43:43.900
Okay? Keep breathing.

43:43.940 --> 43:46.020
Five, five and five.

43:49.860 --> 43:50.940
You're almost there.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.460
You're almost there. You're doing great.

43:56.420 --> 43:57.620
...Five.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.180
We're there, we are there.

44:04.300 --> 44:05.260
There, you told me.

44:10.420 --> 44:11.580
You did it.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.180
You learned something.

44:18.860 --> 44:20.020
Didn't you?

44:24.500 --> 44:25.460
You did beautifully.

44:27.620 --> 44:28.620
You did beautifully.

45:18.220 --> 45:19.780
I miss him so much.

45:40.020 --> 45:41.700
I've been afraid of here before.

45:43.740 --> 45:45.540
Yes, it seems likely.

45:47.980 --> 45:49.460
I just didn't know it was fear.

45:54.980 --> 45:58.460
I became afraid, and I stopped writing.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.260
What was different, the last time?

46:09.580 --> 46:10.620
I heard a sound.

46:31.700 --> 46:32.660
Nick?

46:36.060 --> 46:37.220
Nick!

46:43.820 --> 46:44.900
Nick!

46:54.820 --> 46:55.660
Nick!

47:02.180 --> 47:02.980
Nick!

48:06.820 --> 48:08.300
You didn't hear Nick screaming.

48:12.820 --> 48:14.020
Apparently not.

48:14.540 --> 48:18.060
And because you experienced something
that you can't explain rationally,

48:18.100 --> 48:20.620
you placed Eden very high
on the pyramid chart.

48:26.180 --> 48:28.700
Eden was the catalyst
that triggered your fear.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.700
You jumped to conclusions...

48:31.380 --> 48:33.740
and tied the emotional event with a place.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.780
When you feel threat, it's natural to react.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.740
If the danger were real,
your fear would save your life,

48:42.100 --> 48:45.580
because your adrenaline would
be used for fight or flight.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.860
But what you're experiencing
is panic, nothing more.

48:51.460 --> 48:53.300
The scream wasn't real.

49:03.780 --> 49:04.860
Stop!

49:07.940 --> 49:09.540
Calm down.

49:10.460 --> 49:11.900
You shouldn't have come here.

49:13.540 --> 49:15.700
You're just so damn arrogant.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.420
But this may not last.

49:21.260 --> 49:22.420
Have you thought of that?

49:33.860 --> 49:37.340
Oak trees grow to be hundreds of years old.

49:38.460 --> 49:44.140
They only have to produce one single tree
every hundred years in order to propagate.

49:44.660 --> 49:46.140
May sound benign to you, but

49:46.780 --> 49:50.260
it was a big thing for me to realize that
when I was out here with Nick.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.940
The acorns fell on the roof then, too...

50:00.900 --> 50:03.700
kept falling, and falling,

50:05.060 --> 50:07.300
and dying, and dying.

50:13.100 --> 50:14.460
And I understood that...

50:16.980 --> 50:19.940
everything that used to be
beautiful about Eden,

50:21.300 --> 50:22.820
was perhaps hideous.

50:25.980 --> 50:29.860
Now I could hear
what I couldn't hear before.
