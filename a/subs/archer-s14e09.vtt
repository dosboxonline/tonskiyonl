WEBVTT

00:11.456 --> 00:14.630
I am calling for an official
vote by the General Assembly

00:14.630 --> 00:18.403
<i>to ban private
spy organizations worldwide.</i>

00:18.403 --> 00:21.777
<i>Their lawless shadow world
must end!</i>

00:21.777 --> 00:23.480
Can't they find
anyone to defend us?

00:23.480 --> 00:25.719
Well, the North Koreans said
we're an excellent example

00:25.719 --> 00:28.123
of the fatal contradictions
of capitalism.

00:28.123 --> 00:29.660
Damn.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.463
Why do the people who hate us
have the best arguments?

00:31.463 --> 00:33.735
I mean, the easy answer
is 'cause they're right.

00:33.735 --> 00:36.473
But the correct,
more complex answer, is,

00:36.473 --> 00:40.214
uh, very complex.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.416
Yes, I left Interpol abruptly.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.588
And, yes,
I work in an industry

00:43.588 --> 00:45.224
whose rep is worse than
an ongoing orphanage fire.

00:45.224 --> 00:48.163
But I'm easier
to work with now.

00:48.163 --> 00:50.200
Oh, that's just
like you, Steve,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.604
you dribble of piss.

00:51.604 --> 00:52.873
Ugh! Bollocks!

00:52.873 --> 00:54.710
So how's the job search?

00:54.710 --> 00:56.714
Honestly?
On the upswing.

00:56.714 --> 00:58.216
- <i>Guys, the mission?</i>
- Really?

00:58.216 --> 00:59.285
- We're still doing that?
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

00:59.285 --> 01:01.122
<i>They're just grandstanding.</i>

01:01.122 --> 01:02.258
<i>Do you know how much dirt
private spy agencies have</i>

01:02.258 --> 01:03.460
<i>on those UN dorks?</i>

01:03.460 --> 01:04.897
<i>They'll cave before the vote.</i>

01:04.897 --> 01:07.234
So our business that's
being banned for being dirty

01:07.234 --> 01:09.640
won't be banned because
it's too dirty to ban?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.309
That's your argument?

01:11.309 --> 01:13.614
<i>It would appear that it is.</i>

01:13.614 --> 01:16.252
I have to make some calls.
Totally unrelated.

01:16.252 --> 01:17.889
Look, this isn't going to
happen because it can't happen,

01:17.889 --> 01:19.727
so let's just stop
talking about it!

01:19.727 --> 01:21.363
<i>Right, sort of.</i>

01:21.363 --> 01:23.300
<i>But let's just be
professionals here.</i>

01:23.300 --> 01:26.874
<i>And speaking of the opposite
of that, where is Archer?</i>

01:26.874 --> 01:28.678
He's here.

01:28.678 --> 01:31.249
Waiting patiently.
And professionally.

01:31.249 --> 01:33.320
Well, those two are
definitely professionals.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.923
You said it was
an escort mission.

01:34.923 --> 01:36.426
<i>Uh, no one said that.</i>

01:36.426 --> 01:38.765
<i>The mission is simple.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:40.502
<i>Oh, God, are they breathing?</i>

01:40.502 --> 01:42.405
We did go pretty hard
last night.

01:42.405 --> 01:45.477
Anyone bring any of those, uh,
what, uh, oh, nose mirrors?

01:45.477 --> 01:46.580
What sensitivity you need?

01:46.580 --> 01:48.150
You travel with those?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.385
Uh, you don't?

01:49.385 --> 01:50.555
Voicemail!

01:50.555 --> 01:52.391
I know you're there, Catherine!

01:52.391 --> 01:54.295
Pick up,
you sniveling strumpet!

01:55.464 --> 01:57.201
Oh, there they go.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.773
All right, everybody,
let's go have a great mission!

01:59.773 --> 02:02.946
Oh, uh, wait,
what's the mission?

02:02.946 --> 02:05.685
Also, what country is this?

02:42.324 --> 02:44.663
<i>So now that we've got the
distractions out of the way--</i>

02:44.663 --> 02:46.867
They weren't distractions, Lana.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.838
They were people
with real hopes

02:48.838 --> 02:50.742
and real dreams
and real fake names.

02:50.742 --> 02:52.244
Which were?

02:52.244 --> 02:53.614
Like I've got
the brain space for that.

02:53.614 --> 02:55.250
Got the brain space for
what country you're in?

02:55.250 --> 02:56.319
Barbados.

02:56.319 --> 02:57.889
No, wait. Bahrain.

02:57.889 --> 02:59.459
I--I know it's got
a bar in it.

02:59.459 --> 03:02.364
<i>So in Rio de Janeiro--</i>

03:02.364 --> 03:05.839
Ha! It was the bra
I was thinking of in Brazil.

03:05.839 --> 03:07.007
Come on, let's go.

03:07.007 --> 03:09.378
Time is of the essence. Probably.

03:09.378 --> 03:11.851
<i>The Chinese military developed
a high-tech bunker buster,</i>

03:11.851 --> 03:13.888
<i>and the US government
wants a look at it.</i>

03:13.888 --> 03:16.359
<i>But they can't be seen
to be involved.</i>

03:16.359 --> 03:18.698
Isn't that a great argument
for us continuing to exist?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.668
Not if you're the Chinese.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.539
<i>So some Chinese gangsters
went rogue and stole it,</i>

03:22.539 --> 03:24.008
<i>and then immediately panicked.</i>

03:24.008 --> 03:25.578
<i>We're not sure
who the buyer is,</i>

03:25.578 --> 03:27.281
<i>but to narrow it down,
just make a list</i>

03:27.281 --> 03:29.553
<i>of every terrorist
organization in the world.</i>

03:29.553 --> 03:31.422
I'm definitely
not doing that.

03:31.422 --> 03:32.859
<i>They chose Brazil
for the handoff</i>

03:32.859 --> 03:34.797
<i>because this time of year,
it is...</i>

03:34.797 --> 03:36.901
<i>A bit distracting.</i>

03:38.971 --> 03:41.309
I think you mean awesome, Lana.

03:41.309 --> 03:43.280
The pageantry, the history,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.050
the popo zau--right?

03:45.050 --> 03:46.854
Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about distractions.

03:46.854 --> 03:48.825
He seems pretty dialed in.

03:48.825 --> 03:50.895
<i>So the handoff is happening
at a black market warehouse</i>

03:50.895 --> 03:52.866
<i>here, owned by
Brazilian gangsters.</i>

03:52.866 --> 03:55.705
<i>You intercept the bomb and
drive it to the helipad here.</i>

03:55.705 --> 03:57.909
Infiltrate, extract, transport.
Got it.

03:57.909 --> 04:00.347
Now in regards
to intelligence on this one,

04:00.347 --> 04:02.384
do you know if any of
these gangsters are hiring?

04:02.384 --> 04:03.620
<i>And that's goodbye.</i>

04:07.061 --> 04:08.831
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.369
- Yeah, hi.
- Also hi.

04:11.369 --> 04:14.408
You think you might want
to address the troops?

04:14.408 --> 04:18.584
I think you sent an
intense email by accident.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.424
So I understand
that this is a shock,

04:22.424 --> 04:23.861
but you are not fired.

04:23.861 --> 04:25.598
This is a hiatus.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.836
And we will be back in
business when the smoke clears.

04:27.836 --> 04:29.405
Don't mind me.

04:29.405 --> 04:32.779
Just collecting
rage pheromones for nothing.

04:32.779 --> 04:34.883
Thank you all
for your hard work.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.488
Each and every one of you
is truly...

04:37.488 --> 04:39.793
Valued.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.429
Hey, Kirk, wait!

04:41.429 --> 04:43.033
You forgot your--

04:43.033 --> 04:45.370
Literal bag of shit.

04:45.370 --> 04:47.576
<i>Seems a bit harsh.</i>

04:47.576 --> 04:49.546
That's what these guys are.

04:49.546 --> 04:51.349
That pangolin
is clearly dehydrated.

04:51.349 --> 04:53.053
Wait. Oh, my God.

04:53.053 --> 04:54.723
- <i>Is it the bomb?</i>
- What bomb?

04:54.723 --> 04:56.125
Oh, right. No.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.965
It's a case of
Glengoolie Green whiskey.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.702
Is that the most
important thing?

05:00.702 --> 05:02.037
Seriously?

05:02.037 --> 05:03.975
They only made, like,
100 cases of that.

05:03.975 --> 05:06.346
50, 30 of which
were lost at sea.

05:06.346 --> 05:08.483
Oh, yeah, I also see the bomb.

05:08.483 --> 05:11.489
Uh, it looks like
the buyer hasn't shown yet.

05:11.489 --> 05:13.059
It's just the Chinese
and the Brazilians.

05:13.059 --> 05:14.696
So here's the plan.

05:14.696 --> 05:16.099
I'm gonna go open some crates

05:16.099 --> 05:17.903
to see if they have anymore
Glengoolie Green.

05:17.903 --> 05:19.438
And then?

05:19.438 --> 05:21.442
- <i>Well, that depends.</i>
- On what?

05:21.442 --> 05:22.812
<i>On whether I find it.</i>

05:22.812 --> 05:24.081
<i>Wait, that's the plan?</i>

05:24.081 --> 05:25.652
Do nothing
and hope it works out?

05:25.652 --> 05:27.154
Well, what else can we do?

05:27.154 --> 05:29.025
Unless someone with
lots of money--

05:29.025 --> 05:31.597
so much that they don't
have any use for it...

05:31.597 --> 05:32.699
Could hire us.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.101
Who would even do that?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.707
Like, do you guys have
any real skills?

05:36.707 --> 05:38.744
- I'm an accountant!
- I know all the science.

05:38.744 --> 05:40.515
I said real skills.

05:40.515 --> 05:43.688
I guess it's not as useful
as glue-sniffing tolerance.

05:43.688 --> 05:45.692
- Though I am willing to learn.
- Me too!

05:45.692 --> 05:47.061
<i>So I hate to interrupt</i>

05:47.061 --> 05:48.564
<i>your planned addiction here,
but--</i>

05:48.564 --> 05:50.100
Demon fridge!

05:50.100 --> 05:51.904
Whoa, easy. It's Barry.

05:51.904 --> 05:53.975
Yeah, and I'm not sure
the answer to the question,

05:53.975 --> 05:56.947
"How do I hurt refrigerator?"
is knife.

05:56.947 --> 05:58.551
<i>I've been here for weeks.</i>

05:58.551 --> 05:59.786
Or you just got here,

05:59.786 --> 06:01.523
and you're messing
with our memories.

06:01.523 --> 06:02.926
Who even am I?

06:02.926 --> 06:05.030
<i>So where's my freaking body,
Krieger?</i>

06:05.030 --> 06:07.669
<i>You shoved me in this fridge,
and you said it was temporary.</i>

06:07.669 --> 06:09.940
Hey, I was almost done
with the prototype for you.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.710
But then I ran into
a scientific roadblock.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.013
<i>Which was?</i>

06:13.013 --> 06:14.583
I got bored.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.052
Ah! My microscope eye.

06:16.052 --> 06:18.189
So first of all,

06:18.189 --> 06:21.062
everything is totally fine
and normal.

06:21.062 --> 06:23.466
But just in case, we need
to clean this place out

06:23.466 --> 06:24.970
so we can get our deposit back.

06:24.970 --> 06:28.076
And if we get our deposit back,
I will split it with you.

06:28.076 --> 06:30.948
And if you find anything cool,
you can sell it.

06:30.948 --> 06:32.552
One question.

06:32.552 --> 06:34.756
@

06:34.756 --> 06:36.092
What have I done
to deserve this?

06:36.092 --> 06:37.829
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

06:37.829 --> 06:39.866
<i>Pushed all your mistakes
down this elevator shaft?</i>

06:39.866 --> 06:41.503
So ballpark,

06:41.503 --> 06:44.075
how many bodies do you think
we pushed down here?

06:44.075 --> 06:45.745
Uh, I did two or three.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.916
Two or three bodies.
Not so bad.

06:47.916 --> 06:50.554
Oh, no,
two or three ballparks.

06:51.355 --> 06:52.892
<i>So now can we get the bomb?</i>

06:52.892 --> 06:54.161
Not until I tell everyone

06:54.161 --> 06:55.865
<i>how I just found
the coolest thing.</i>

06:55.865 --> 06:57.702
- So do it.
- I just did.

06:57.702 --> 06:59.840
And now, you don't get
to know what it is.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.908
Hang on.

07:00.908 --> 07:02.612
- Something's happening.
- Shit.

07:02.612 --> 07:04.248
Buyer still hasn't shown up,
and there's no translator.

07:04.248 --> 07:06.553
Wait.
Archer, you speak Portuguese.

07:06.553 --> 07:08.189
- <i>Claro.</i>
- And I speak a little Chinese.

07:08.189 --> 07:09.860
Great, so you go down there

07:09.860 --> 07:11.229
and explain that
you're the buyers,

07:11.229 --> 07:13.934
they give us the bomb,
and we get out of here.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.105
- Yes, Pam.
- It's kind of genius.

07:16.105 --> 07:17.709
<i>Hmm, seems complicated.</i>

07:17.709 --> 07:19.713
What if I just solved
everything myself

07:19.713 --> 07:21.082
while you guys stare at me
in quiet awe,

07:21.082 --> 07:22.886
proving that
I don't need anyone?

07:22.886 --> 07:24.155
And how are you
gonna do that?

07:24.155 --> 07:25.591
I'm going to introduce
them to my friend,

07:25.591 --> 07:27.529
Mr. Basic Acoustics.

07:28.998 --> 07:31.870
And Mr. Basic Acoustics'
first name is...

07:31.870 --> 07:33.106
Uh...

07:33.106 --> 07:34.776
Ugh, forget it.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.140
Death By!
His first name is Death By.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.510
I nailed it.

07:51.510 --> 07:54.048
Death by basic acoustics, right?

07:54.048 --> 07:55.685
Come on.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.756
Guys?

07:57.756 --> 07:59.625
Should have waited.

08:01.797 --> 08:03.701
All right, stay focused.

08:03.701 --> 08:05.070
I see a gap in the line.
Ready?

08:05.070 --> 08:06.706
And, now!

08:09.846 --> 08:12.652
Why isn't every day Carnival?

08:12.652 --> 08:14.155
Um, because society
would collapse?

08:14.155 --> 08:15.758
Totally worth it.

08:15.758 --> 08:17.829
You know,
if this is our last mission,

08:17.829 --> 08:19.231
not a bad way to go out.

08:19.231 --> 08:20.635
Stop saying that.

08:20.635 --> 08:22.104
Everything's gonna be fine,

08:22.104 --> 08:25.845
so shut up and let me focus
on how great my ass looks.

08:25.845 --> 08:27.749
<i>Well, counterpoint,
maybe you suck.</i>

08:27.749 --> 08:29.619
- Maybe I will.
- <i>What?</i>

08:29.619 --> 08:31.757
<i>I've lost the thread
on this argument.</i>

08:31.757 --> 08:33.961
You pointed out that
Cheryl wasn't helping,

08:33.961 --> 08:36.900
despite the fact that
you aren't helping either.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.105
<i>Hey, I gave you that water,
and just so you know,</i>

08:39.105 --> 08:41.977
<i>when I do that,
it feels like I'm peeing.</i>

08:41.977 --> 08:43.914
- Dude.
- Fascinating.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.054
So your physical sensations are
mapped onto the refrigerator.

08:47.054 --> 08:48.858
<i>Kind of, yeah.</i>

08:48.858 --> 08:50.293
<i>Is that gonna help you
put me back into my body?</i>

08:50.293 --> 08:52.097
Not yet, but in the future,

08:52.097 --> 08:53.901
maybe we'll all be trapped
in refrigerators,

08:53.901 --> 08:55.805
so you won't feel as bad.

08:55.805 --> 08:58.276
Gah, my non-microscope eye!

08:58.276 --> 09:00.982
- What the--
- It's Milton.

09:06.693 --> 09:08.798
<i>Well, at least
that's not depressing.</i>

09:08.798 --> 09:11.603
Isn't there, like,
another elevator shaft

09:11.603 --> 09:12.839
we could push this trash down?

09:12.839 --> 09:14.709
Oh, I hate this job.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.112
I hate losing this job.

09:16.112 --> 09:17.916
Stupid elevator shaft!

09:17.916 --> 09:20.320
Good God, you guys
complain so much.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.191
Just look around
for some garbage to sell

09:22.191 --> 09:25.765
so you can buy that rent thing
you're always whining about.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.002
Do you not know what rent is?

09:28.002 --> 09:31.810
I want to say
a kind of poor people food,

09:31.810 --> 09:34.014
like kibble?

09:35.885 --> 09:37.187
Mmm.

09:37.187 --> 09:38.891
This is--and I don't
say this lightly--

09:38.891 --> 09:40.393
concentrated liquid orgasm.

09:40.393 --> 09:42.866
Ugh, gross.

09:42.866 --> 09:45.403
But you're absolutely right.

09:49.679 --> 09:52.284
So what are y'all gonna do
when this is over?

09:52.284 --> 09:54.088
- Oh, come on!
- Stop.

09:54.088 --> 09:55.825
<i>We've got intelligence that</i>

09:55.825 --> 09:58.062
<i>the Chinese are staking out
all major helipads.</i>

09:58.062 --> 09:59.833
<i>You're going to have to
turn off the parade route.</i>

09:59.833 --> 10:01.002
- Oh, no!
- Aww, come on!

10:01.002 --> 10:02.805
- Boo!
- <i>Yeah, real sorry</i>

10:02.805 --> 10:04.275
<i>you gotta do a mission
during the mission.</i>

10:04.275 --> 10:06.045
Well, at least
you apologized.

10:06.045 --> 10:07.982
<i>I found you a clearing
you can use up in the hills.</i>

10:07.982 --> 10:09.920
<i>- I'll send coordinates.</i>
- So hear me out.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.657
What if we just stayed
on the parade route

10:11.657 --> 10:13.092
and sold the bomb
to the Chinese?

10:13.092 --> 10:14.729
<i>I don't know.
They'd probably kill you</i>

10:14.729 --> 10:16.767
<i>and maybe start World War III.</i>

10:16.767 --> 10:18.203
What are we thinking?
Worth a shot?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.877
Idiots!

10:21.877 --> 10:23.446
Aw, how can I complain
about idiots

10:23.446 --> 10:25.818
without any idiots
to complain to?

10:25.818 --> 10:27.321
But what does it mean?

10:27.321 --> 10:28.891
What does what mean?

10:28.891 --> 10:31.462
Oh, uh, just our newfound
closeness as a team.

10:31.462 --> 10:33.066
We also found some keys.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.736
- Really, Cheryl?
- What?

10:34.736 --> 10:37.074
You know I'm not good with
nonverbal communication.

10:37.074 --> 10:38.777
<i>Just incidentally,</i>

10:38.777 --> 10:40.380
<i>what kind of communication
are you good with?</i>

10:40.380 --> 10:42.251
- What?
- <i>OK.</i>

10:42.251 --> 10:43.285
So?

10:45.290 --> 10:47.929
Anyone recognize these?

10:47.929 --> 10:49.131
New task.

10:49.131 --> 10:50.400
Figure out
what these keys go to.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.904
Search everywhere.

10:51.904 --> 10:53.339
Maybe it's something
we can sell.

10:53.339 --> 10:54.943
Did you just clear a throat

10:54.943 --> 10:56.145
you do not have?

10:56.145 --> 10:57.314
<i>Uh, I want to help.</i>

10:57.314 --> 10:58.349
Uh, I hate
to break this to you,

10:58.349 --> 11:00.955
but you are a refrigerator.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.259
<i>I am aware!</i>

11:03.259 --> 11:06.265
<i>And I've been shoved in
that break room for months,</i>

11:06.265 --> 11:08.136
<i>trying to start conversations
with people</i>

11:08.136 --> 11:11.242
<i>who are shoving things into
what feels like my rib cage</i>

11:11.242 --> 11:12.946
<i>and basically ignoring me.</i>

11:12.946 --> 11:15.216
<i>I saved all of your lives
from Other Barry,</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:18.857
<i>so will you please just
give me a goddamn hand?</i>

11:18.857 --> 11:21.429
Sorry, have we established
where this weird fridge

11:21.429 --> 11:23.433
came from
and why it talks like this?

11:23.433 --> 11:24.502
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Several times.

11:24.502 --> 11:25.470
- Repeatedly.
- But you're, like,

11:25.470 --> 11:27.307
kind of a pain to haul around.

11:27.307 --> 11:29.311
And we only brought you down
here because you begged us.

11:29.311 --> 11:30.948
<i>We solved this last time.</i>

11:30.948 --> 11:32.518
<i>Just take my circuits out.</i>

11:32.518 --> 11:34.154
- Oh, right.
- Duh.

11:34.154 --> 11:36.325
<i>Just put me on something
light with wheels.</i>

11:37.862 --> 11:40.266
<i>Yeah, not what I had in mind.</i>

11:42.237 --> 11:43.941
And what did
you have in mind?

11:43.941 --> 11:45.076
Not this.

11:45.076 --> 11:46.780
Pam, what's going on?

11:46.780 --> 11:47.982
It's not me.

11:47.982 --> 11:49.285
Jesus Christ,
what's the problem?

11:49.285 --> 11:51.523
Uh, Jesus Christ?

11:51.523 --> 11:53.393
Oh, right.

11:53.393 --> 11:55.263
Uh, not to be
sacrilegious here,

11:55.263 --> 11:58.302
but did anyone bring
a chainsaw?

11:59.037 --> 12:01.008
Is it me,
or did the gun library

12:01.008 --> 12:02.244
used to have more guns?

12:02.244 --> 12:04.783
- It's called an armory.
- Ugh, fine.

12:04.783 --> 12:08.056
Didn't the gun library
used to have more armory?

12:08.056 --> 12:09.959
Ooh, look, Cheryl, a clipboard.

12:09.959 --> 12:11.495
It goes snap, snap.

12:11.495 --> 12:13.266
I know what you're doing.
I'm--

12:13.266 --> 12:15.370
Not--oh!

12:15.370 --> 12:16.807
An idiot.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.109
Who can't--

12:20.013 --> 12:22.317
So you've been
selling the guns, huh?

12:22.317 --> 12:24.889
Jeezy Petes, are we really
in that bad of shape?

12:24.889 --> 12:27.194
Even if the UN doesn't ban us,
we might still go under?

12:27.194 --> 12:28.396
You're the accountant.

12:28.396 --> 12:29.866
And I'm starting to suspect

12:29.866 --> 12:31.903
the numbers you're giving me
aren't real.

12:31.903 --> 12:33.239
Oh, really?
You don't think that the bribes

12:33.239 --> 12:34.943
and the hush money
and the payoffs

12:34.943 --> 12:37.414
from third world oligarchs
was recorded accurately?

12:37.414 --> 12:39.418
Well, I--

12:39.418 --> 12:41.923
oh, uh, yes?

12:41.923 --> 12:43.927
If you knew the amount
of lying and cheating

12:43.927 --> 12:46.098
and moral compromise
being the boss requires,

12:46.098 --> 12:48.169
you would all never stop
giving me cunnilingus.

12:48.169 --> 12:50.908
Well, if the offer
is on the table--

12:50.908 --> 12:52.044
Oh, no.
I dated you, remember?

12:52.044 --> 12:53.847
And even that big ass
hog of yours

12:53.847 --> 12:56.118
didn't make up for your mouth
in more ways than one.

12:56.118 --> 12:58.222
You would apologize
to the bullet that killed you.

12:58.222 --> 13:00.160
Well, I'm sorry
for being polite.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.930
Oh, you just did it again!

13:01.930 --> 13:03.901
Jesus Christ!

13:03.901 --> 13:06.272
Hit the gas, Pam.

13:06.272 --> 13:08.209
You know, if we use
the principle of leverage--

13:08.209 --> 13:10.046
Then we'll be here
all damn day.

13:10.046 --> 13:11.115
Floor it, Pam!

13:16.927 --> 13:17.895
Ow.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.903
Told you it would work.

13:21.903 --> 13:23.874
<i>Oh, I told myself
it would work.</i>

13:23.874 --> 13:25.276
And then I clawed and I scraped

13:25.276 --> 13:26.947
while you all
whined and complained,

13:26.947 --> 13:29.318
until when I finally closed
my tired eyes to sleep,

13:29.318 --> 13:32.424
all I could see were
your sour, crumpled faces.

13:32.424 --> 13:36.165
Uh, for the record, I wasn't
really around for any of that.

13:36.165 --> 13:38.136
Shut your goddamn
nonexistent mouth!

13:38.136 --> 13:40.407
I would say that we should
have sold you for parts,

13:40.407 --> 13:41.943
but you know what?
I'm glad we saved you

13:41.943 --> 13:43.914
because you finally
achieved your proper form,

13:43.914 --> 13:47.454
because now, you both literally
and figuratively suck!

13:47.454 --> 13:49.258
- Lana.
- What?

13:49.258 --> 13:51.563
There's writing
on Mr. Snappy that looks

13:51.563 --> 13:54.669
a lot like
the writing on the keys.

13:54.669 --> 13:57.274
Great, now we just need
to find Tom Sawyer.

13:57.274 --> 13:59.311
Anyone got the number
to Mark Twain's cemetery?

13:59.311 --> 14:01.215
Tom Sawyer? That's funny.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.185
It's also the name
of a Rush song.

14:04.454 --> 14:05.658
Oh, you don't know that one?

14:05.658 --> 14:07.027
It's the best.

14:07.027 --> 14:10.935
It goes--um, uh--

14:10.935 --> 14:17.682
I don't know how it goes.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.386
Oh, my God,
I don't know how it goes!

14:24.529 --> 14:26.332
- This is really it, huh?
- Yep.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.104
- Then it's back to Carnival.
- Oh, seriously?

14:29.104 --> 14:31.008
Everything will be fine.
It always is for me.

14:31.008 --> 14:32.377
I don't need anyone.

14:32.377 --> 14:33.981
This really how
you want to go out?

14:33.981 --> 14:35.250
- Uh-huh.
- But it's us.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.086
There's nothing to discuss.

14:42.463 --> 14:44.034
How could I forget that?

14:44.034 --> 14:45.336
Something's wrong.

14:45.336 --> 14:47.608
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

14:47.608 --> 14:50.446
Unrelated, has anything weird
been happening?

14:50.446 --> 14:53.219
Like, more weird than
everything else about you.

14:53.219 --> 14:54.589
You know,
now that you mention it,

14:54.589 --> 14:57.160
these weird scars keep
showing up on my skull.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.564
Huh.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.734
<i>So we're just gonna--</i>

15:00.734 --> 15:03.640
Search his lab immediately?
Yes.

15:04.742 --> 15:06.580
Hello!

15:06.580 --> 15:09.451
You absolute turds.

15:14.294 --> 15:15.998
Slater?

15:15.998 --> 15:17.735
I thought it was appropriate
that your last mission

15:17.735 --> 15:20.273
before vanishing into
the dustbin of history

15:20.273 --> 15:22.712
would be polishing
my glorious balls.

15:22.712 --> 15:25.183
Dude, I don't want to
be picturing your balls.

15:25.183 --> 15:26.418
I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

15:26.418 --> 15:28.590
Seriously?
You're still in the CIA

15:28.590 --> 15:31.763
after your catastrophic
fuck up in Manatina?

15:31.763 --> 15:34.301
Ha! Catastrophic? For the CIA?

15:34.301 --> 15:36.272
They gave me
a commendation for that.

15:36.272 --> 15:39.144
So we don't like this guy.
Is that our vibe here?

15:39.144 --> 15:41.415
Keep it down, Glarey Poppins.
Act like your government.

15:41.415 --> 15:43.186
Stand behind the Americans
and nod

15:43.186 --> 15:45.423
while your influence
steadily wanes.

15:45.423 --> 15:47.160
Look, I'm gonna need
some kind of confirmation

15:47.160 --> 15:49.566
that this is official
CIA business.

15:49.566 --> 15:51.703
Oh, sure.
Just, uh, hang on for a sec.

15:51.703 --> 15:54.509
Hello, CIA?

15:54.509 --> 15:57.347
That Chinese weapon you're
stealing, are you stealing it?

15:57.347 --> 15:59.484
- Thanks.
- You don't do the phone bit.

15:59.484 --> 16:01.055
I do the phone bits.

16:01.055 --> 16:02.324
You know what?
That's a great point.

16:02.324 --> 16:04.194
And yet another example

16:04.194 --> 16:07.200
of me doing everything you do,
but better.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.173
And, hey, Pam, my balls.

16:10.173 --> 16:12.043
Goddamn it!

16:12.043 --> 16:13.379
I just stopped
thinking about them.

16:13.379 --> 16:15.383
This feels very wrong.

16:15.383 --> 16:17.053
Glarey Poppins?

16:17.053 --> 16:18.456
I'll give him
a spoonful of shit.

16:18.456 --> 16:20.093
I will, I will.

16:20.093 --> 16:22.197
<i>Problem, Lana.</i>

16:22.197 --> 16:23.600
We're kind of busy here, OK?
So--

16:23.600 --> 16:25.604
Slater came to
pick up the bomb.

16:25.604 --> 16:27.474
- What? That bitch?
- <i>Right?</i>

16:27.474 --> 16:29.111
<i>Can you confirm
he's in the CIA?</i>

16:29.111 --> 16:31.148
Well, my only contact
was whoever hired us.

16:31.148 --> 16:32.652
And if they were
pretending, I--

16:32.652 --> 16:35.624
Well, guess I'll just solve it
myself then, like always.

16:35.624 --> 16:37.494
All right, guys,
we have no way of knowing

16:37.494 --> 16:39.097
if he's on the level or not,

16:39.097 --> 16:41.168
so my thought is we just
stop worrying about it

16:41.168 --> 16:42.404
and go look at some popo zau.

16:42.404 --> 16:43.807
Oh, my God, yes.

16:43.807 --> 16:46.145
Yes, I know I can't get
my job back at Interpol,

16:46.145 --> 16:47.648
but I need to know
if someone named Slater

16:47.648 --> 16:50.153
is still affiliated
with the CIA.

16:50.153 --> 16:52.090
I guess it's a mononym?

16:52.090 --> 16:53.527
Right. Thanks.

16:53.527 --> 16:54.829
Yeah, that sounded, uh--

16:54.829 --> 16:57.535
- Like we just got fucked?
- Royally.

16:57.535 --> 17:00.173
Slater was officially disavowed
by the CIA last month.

17:00.173 --> 17:02.545
But they didn't share that with
independent spy organizations

17:02.545 --> 17:04.649
because we're all
about to not exist.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.118
I really wish you hadn't
told me that

17:06.118 --> 17:08.189
because now,
I have to destroy Slater.

17:08.189 --> 17:10.259
No way I'm going out like that
on my last mission.

17:10.259 --> 17:11.529
A-ha!

17:11.529 --> 17:13.199
So you admit
it's your last mission.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.704
Hey, no gloating during
rage-induced breakthroughs.

17:15.704 --> 17:17.240
What are you looking for now?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.654
Remember when I told you
I found something cool

17:23.654 --> 17:24.755
at the warehouse?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.529
I have no memory
of this door.

17:33.439 --> 17:38.516
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

17:41.455 --> 17:43.426
You have no idea
how to use that thing.

17:43.426 --> 17:45.864
I have no idea how to do
most of the stuff I do.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.367
Are you sure
you can catch up?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.436
Just give it a second.

17:48.436 --> 17:49.605
Think about Slater.

17:49.605 --> 17:51.442
It's not enough for him to win.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.686
I gotta tell him.

17:56.686 --> 17:59.290
Hey, dummy,
bring me back around.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.434
This is nuts.

18:04.434 --> 18:06.438
Just so you know,

18:06.438 --> 18:08.476
I'm not CIA anymore.

18:08.476 --> 18:11.181
Jetpa--ahh!

18:11.181 --> 18:12.718
Speaking of nuts.

18:12.718 --> 18:14.354
God, watch the propeller!

18:14.354 --> 18:16.526
Watch the human
sashimi maker?

18:16.526 --> 18:17.694
Got it!

18:26.879 --> 18:27.881
Ah!

18:31.221 --> 18:32.858
A little help?

18:32.858 --> 18:34.595
How?
I can't see what's happening.

18:34.595 --> 18:36.800
Uh, Ray, get the
reflection out of my eye.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.737
I can't see.
Wait a second.

18:38.737 --> 18:40.874
Pam, your mirrors!

19:06.926 --> 19:08.596
Ugh. Oh!

19:17.480 --> 19:18.950
Oh, my God, he did it.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.221
Yeah, but, uh--

19:25.864 --> 19:27.534
<i>Cuidado, cuidado!</i>

19:31.408 --> 19:32.711
Jesus.

19:32.711 --> 19:33.980
Well, it's not like
it's the worst thing

19:33.980 --> 19:35.249
that ever happened to him.

19:37.353 --> 19:39.424
I win again!

19:39.424 --> 19:40.961
You should have let it go.

19:40.961 --> 19:43.667
Let it go and miss this?

19:43.667 --> 19:46.739
Me, Sterling Archer,
beating you yet again?

19:46.739 --> 19:48.577
I'm so glad I didn't let it go.

19:48.577 --> 19:51.950
This is the best moment
of my life!

19:51.950 --> 19:53.687
Why would I let it go?

19:53.687 --> 19:55.423
Why?

19:55.423 --> 19:57.460
You're about to find out why.

20:08.783 --> 20:09.886
Katya?

20:09.886 --> 20:11.689
Sterling, my darling.

20:11.689 --> 20:14.027
I ache to see you.

20:14.027 --> 20:15.864
Well, I'm aching too, Katya.

20:15.864 --> 20:17.635
And I--I have to ask
before we do

20:17.635 --> 20:19.437
what I think we're about to do.

20:19.437 --> 20:20.507
Does it still vibrate?

20:20.507 --> 20:22.377
That is not the ache I mean.

20:22.377 --> 20:24.849
I ache because I must do this.

20:29.357 --> 20:32.564
And, yes, it still vibrates.

20:39.745 --> 20:40.581
Sterling Archer.

20:40.581 --> 20:41.616
Code name: Duchess--

20:41.616 --> 20:43.319
No one calls me that.

20:43.319 --> 20:46.726
Known from Berlin
to Bangkok as the man

20:46.726 --> 20:49.866
who used to be the world's
most dangerous spy.

20:49.866 --> 20:50.901
Used to be?

20:50.901 --> 20:52.337
Take off these chains,

20:52.337 --> 20:53.573
and that potato
on top of your neck

20:53.573 --> 20:55.476
is gonna used to be a face.

20:55.476 --> 20:57.447
Whoa, buddy.
No need for that stuff.

20:57.447 --> 20:58.650
We all got job to do.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.319
And you're terrible at yours.

21:00.319 --> 21:02.023
These nipple clamps
are super pinch-y.

21:02.023 --> 21:03.627
Very unprofessional.

21:03.627 --> 21:06.599
Is that really
your big problem right now?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.469
Yes, because I care
about the craft.

21:08.469 --> 21:10.006
Yeah, the goth teen witch movie.

21:10.006 --> 21:11.709
No.

21:11.709 --> 21:14.615
OK, so anything to say
before I give you zip-zap?

21:14.615 --> 21:15.884
What, with that
golf cart battery?

21:15.884 --> 21:16.986
Go-kart.

21:16.986 --> 21:18.022
And that's not for you.

21:18.022 --> 21:20.292
My go-kart need repair.

21:21.562 --> 21:23.633
That's a big battery.

21:23.633 --> 21:26.739
Ah, fun fact: they use this
to jump-start trains.

21:26.739 --> 21:28.643
That's the least fun fact
I've ever heard.

21:28.643 --> 21:30.379
I don't know if I've said it,
but, uh,

21:30.379 --> 21:31.549
it really is good
to see you again.

21:31.549 --> 21:32.885
Look, I get it.

21:32.885 --> 21:34.054
It's super fun to trot
out the battery

21:34.054 --> 21:36.526
that supposedly
jump-starts trains.

21:36.526 --> 21:38.062
And airplanes.

21:38.062 --> 21:39.799
But we all know that if you
attach that to a human,

21:39.799 --> 21:41.569
he would instantly die,
rendering it useless

21:41.569 --> 21:43.640
as an interrogation tool,
ergo you're bluff--

21:46.913 --> 21:48.516
I'm sorry.
I interrupted you.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.886
Problem?

21:49.886 --> 21:52.490
Yeah, I just didn't think
burning nipples

21:52.490 --> 21:53.793
would smell like that.

21:53.793 --> 21:55.764
Well, maybe the smell
changes as we go.

21:55.764 --> 21:57.534
- What?
- Hit him again.

22:06.653 --> 22:08.957
So maybe I'm unclear on
the order of operations here,

22:08.957 --> 22:10.961
but did you have any questions?

22:10.961 --> 22:13.432
I just wanted you to know
that I'm serious.

22:13.432 --> 22:14.835
You know, Slater,
a sternly worded letter

22:14.835 --> 22:15.938
could do wonders.

22:15.938 --> 22:17.575
Rest up, Archer.

22:17.575 --> 22:19.411
I'd hate for you to die
when I do that again.

22:19.411 --> 22:20.814
I'd hate
both parts of that.

22:20.814 --> 22:22.116
Love to hear it.

22:22.116 --> 22:24.789
Get up, you wimp.

22:26.091 --> 22:27.962
OK.
Take inventory of the room.

22:27.962 --> 22:29.966
Find the tools. Improvise.

22:29.966 --> 22:31.468
I think one
of those clamps melted

22:31.468 --> 22:32.738
and fused into my nipple.

22:32.738 --> 22:34.441
But don't worry about that.

22:34.441 --> 22:35.611
And don't worry
about talking to yourself.

22:35.611 --> 22:37.548
That's not a symptom
of a brain injury,

22:37.548 --> 22:39.752
though you might not
remember if it is.

22:39.752 --> 22:43.425
Sterling, my darling,
what did they do to you?

22:43.425 --> 22:45.597
I quiver with sympathy.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.168
Do--don't say "quiver"
in that sexy voice.

22:48.168 --> 22:50.574
If my nipples get hard, uh,
I might die.

22:50.574 --> 22:52.711
I am so sorry.

22:52.711 --> 22:54.849
It is just that seeing you
like this...

22:54.849 --> 22:57.453
I did not know I could cry.

22:57.453 --> 22:59.558
My cheeks are wet.

22:59.558 --> 23:02.096
I'm gonna pass out now.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.171
So... what are we doing?

23:06.171 --> 23:08.142
Wait, wasn't there
some kind of UN thingy?

23:08.142 --> 23:09.745
How's that going?

23:09.745 --> 23:12.851
<i>This is the best moment
of my life.</i>

23:15.456 --> 23:19.030
I said, how's that going?

23:19.030 --> 23:20.667
Wait, am I invisible?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.170
What's the sound version
of that?

23:22.170 --> 23:24.107
In... visible.

23:24.107 --> 23:26.144
No, I just said that.

23:26.144 --> 23:28.583
Look, I am working
my network.

23:28.583 --> 23:30.019
I <i>am</i> invisible.

23:30.019 --> 23:31.622
If only.

23:31.622 --> 23:33.158
The UN vote on banning
private spy agencies

23:33.158 --> 23:35.731
is in two days, but that's
more than enough time to--

23:35.731 --> 23:37.467
Not what we're talking about.

23:37.467 --> 23:38.803
And it's going to be fine.

23:38.803 --> 23:40.006
We've just got to find Archer.

23:40.006 --> 23:41.909
Look, I've got feelers out.

23:41.909 --> 23:44.648
Just like those
brine shrimp cats I made.

23:44.648 --> 23:46.151
Or didn't.

23:46.151 --> 23:47.554
Krieger, did you figure out
what that weird thing

23:47.554 --> 23:48.656
we found was?

23:51.061 --> 23:53.165
No, but I have determined
that it's creepy

23:53.165 --> 23:54.835
and possibly gross.

23:54.835 --> 23:56.906
So we've got,
like, zero chance

23:56.906 --> 23:59.177
of finding Archer here, right,
or the bomb?

23:59.177 --> 24:00.681
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah, that sounds right.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.050
Did I hear the word "bomb"?

24:02.050 --> 24:04.755
Hey! No!
Just no!

24:04.755 --> 24:06.693
- Yeah, but why no?
- Or how no?

24:06.693 --> 24:07.895
I don't know.

24:07.895 --> 24:09.064
But we are not gonna sit here

24:09.064 --> 24:10.967
and stew in our failure juice.

24:10.967 --> 24:12.805
There's a loose bunker buster
out there.

24:12.805 --> 24:14.542
Do we know who has it?
No.

24:14.542 --> 24:16.946
Do we know where Archer is
or even if he's alive? No.

24:16.946 --> 24:18.683
Are we getting
some pretty awkward inquiries

24:18.683 --> 24:20.821
about our activities in Brazil?
Yes.

24:20.821 --> 24:22.591
See how she just slid
the bad news in there?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.562
Like a greased toboggan.

24:24.562 --> 24:26.566
The rest of our lives
may be doomed and empty,

24:26.566 --> 24:28.670
but, by God, we are going
to live the fuck

24:28.670 --> 24:31.208
out of these last few days
of doing what we are best at,

24:31.208 --> 24:33.713
what we were put
on this Earth to do.

24:33.713 --> 24:35.550
Krieger, figure out that orb.

24:35.550 --> 24:36.953
Barry, help him.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.692
You are made of computer
or whatever.

24:39.692 --> 24:41.061
The rest of you,
get me some plausible

24:41.061 --> 24:42.698
bunker buster targets.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.568
Someone wants to use it
for some evil shit,

24:44.568 --> 24:45.971
and we are gonna
stop that evil shit

24:45.971 --> 24:48.809
because that is what we do!

24:51.014 --> 24:52.584
Sploosh.

24:52.584 --> 24:53.987
I'm sorry.

24:53.987 --> 24:55.857
Slater said
he wouldn't torture you.

24:55.857 --> 24:57.561
Well, I appreciate that.

24:57.561 --> 24:58.997
It was incredibly painful,

24:58.997 --> 25:01.234
especially
after someone shot me!

25:01.234 --> 25:03.138
Oh, Sterling,
you're delirious.

25:03.138 --> 25:05.042
That was me.

25:05.878 --> 25:08.248
You guys have a
4:00 p.m. dinner special here?

25:08.248 --> 25:09.585
What is this place?

25:09.585 --> 25:11.254
Other than a KGB black site.

25:11.254 --> 25:13.726
Abandoned KGB black site.

25:13.726 --> 25:15.262
We've gathered allies
from every

25:15.262 --> 25:17.133
secret intelligence service
in the world.

25:17.133 --> 25:18.570
Retired, mostly.

25:18.570 --> 25:20.874
So, yes, they are seasoned.

25:20.874 --> 25:24.582
We call ourselves... Silverwolf.

25:24.582 --> 25:26.284
Big evil supervillain plan.
Got it.

25:26.284 --> 25:28.857
So what are you gonna do,
blow up Pluto?

25:28.857 --> 25:30.025
Poison all the money
in the world?

25:30.025 --> 25:31.729
Some kind of giant
mystery thing

25:31.729 --> 25:33.298
that turns out to be
an anticlimactic

25:33.298 --> 25:34.635
real estate scam?

25:34.635 --> 25:37.741
Oh, no.

25:37.741 --> 25:39.645
We're not here
to destroy the world.

25:39.645 --> 25:41.148
We're here to save it.

25:41.148 --> 25:45.222
And you, my Sterling,
are going to help us.

25:46.024 --> 25:48.630
<i>And how exactly
does this help?</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:51.000
Well, first, I'm gonna
get you hooked up here.

25:52.938 --> 25:55.877
<i>Oh, this isn't
an improvement.</i>

25:55.877 --> 25:58.315
Huh, must be some residual
programming in there.

25:58.315 --> 26:01.288
<i>Yeah, there's definitely some
residue in here, I would say.</i>

26:01.288 --> 26:03.325
So I created a buffer
between you and the device

26:03.325 --> 26:05.664
so you can observe
the sphere's programming

26:05.664 --> 26:08.670
without contamination,
which will manifest

26:08.670 --> 26:11.007
as these kickass
cyberpunk goggles.

26:11.007 --> 26:12.878
You'll be goggled in
with the wireheads

26:12.878 --> 26:14.147
for sure, choomba.

26:14.147 --> 26:15.784
<i>And these will protect me?</i>

26:15.784 --> 26:17.019
- I don't know.
<i>- What does that mean?</i>

26:17.019 --> 26:18.155
What do you want from me?

26:18.155 --> 26:20.025
Science isn't an exact science.

26:20.025 --> 26:21.228
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

26:21.228 --> 26:22.931
There is no God here.

26:22.931 --> 26:24.702
Anyhoo...

26:25.770 --> 26:27.272
<i>Ohhhhhh.</i>

26:29.845 --> 26:31.716
You're trying to bring back
the Cold War?

26:31.716 --> 26:33.820
No, of course not.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.089
But... yes.

26:35.089 --> 26:36.726
Yeah, I get it.

26:36.726 --> 26:38.095
I mean, who doesn't love
the constant looming threat

26:38.095 --> 26:39.832
of nuclear annihilation?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.736
Look at the world
that we live in.

26:41.736 --> 26:44.174
All these piddling
minor conflicts.

26:44.174 --> 26:47.079
All this peace
and money and... phones.

26:47.079 --> 26:48.816
So things were better
when they were worse?

26:48.816 --> 26:50.052
Exactly.

26:50.052 --> 26:52.390
This is becoming
a world without purpose,

26:52.390 --> 26:56.966
without meaning,
and without Sterling Archer.

26:56.966 --> 26:59.003
The U.S. government
will be voting yes

26:59.003 --> 27:01.742
on the proposal
to ban private spy agencies.

27:01.742 --> 27:03.813
We urge the world to join us.

27:03.813 --> 27:07.854
And in the words of my people,
how 'bout them Cowboys?

27:07.854 --> 27:10.426
Uh, there probably
won't even be more war.

27:10.426 --> 27:13.031
It'll be a staring contest.

27:13.031 --> 27:15.871
But the conflict
will energize us

27:15.871 --> 27:17.841
and make us strong
and give us meaning.

27:17.841 --> 27:20.714
In a frictionless universe,
nothing happens.

27:20.714 --> 27:23.720
And you, uh--who even
are you in that world?

27:23.720 --> 27:25.022
That's ridiculous.

27:25.022 --> 27:28.830
I, uh... do not have
a counterargument.

27:28.830 --> 27:30.299
But what does that
have to do with torturing me?

27:30.299 --> 27:32.403
Slater and I,
we have, uh, mm,

27:32.403 --> 27:34.975
differences of opinion sometimes.

27:34.975 --> 27:37.848
Sterling, it might not be now,
but sometime soon,

27:37.848 --> 27:39.752
you're going to have
to make a decision.

27:39.752 --> 27:43.458
One world includes you,
and the other does not.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.298
And... I have missed you.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.302
- You have?
- Katya, what the hell?

27:48.302 --> 27:49.270
We talked about this.

27:49.270 --> 27:50.774
Yes, we did.

27:50.774 --> 27:52.878
Can I speak to you outside?

27:52.878 --> 27:54.247
Did she give you the pitch?

27:54.247 --> 27:56.117
She's right.
You should join us.

27:57.754 --> 28:00.059
But unfortunately,
we don't let dead men join,

28:00.059 --> 28:04.167
so that may hinder
your onboarding process.

28:05.336 --> 28:09.277
This is about
to be unpleasant.

28:14.822 --> 28:16.191
All right, where am I?

28:16.191 --> 28:17.894
Where am I?

28:17.894 --> 28:19.230
Phone, phone,
where's the phone?

28:20.834 --> 28:22.737
Use the tool
you have, I guess.

28:26.477 --> 28:28.816
Why is everybody
looking at me?

28:28.816 --> 28:30.319
You're presenting
the candidates

28:30.319 --> 28:32.089
for a bunker buster target?

28:32.089 --> 28:34.327
Because you're our
demolitions expert.

28:34.327 --> 28:35.930
Oh, cool.

28:35.930 --> 28:36.932
Is she getting worse?

28:36.932 --> 28:38.302
I mean, could she?

28:38.302 --> 28:40.472
So it's a helix-type
shaped charge

28:40.472 --> 28:42.243
capable of penetrating
30 to 40 feet

28:42.243 --> 28:43.478
of reinforced concrete

28:43.478 --> 28:45.517
with enhanced
shockwave propagation

28:45.517 --> 28:47.053
through the next hundred.

28:47.053 --> 28:48.221
What kind of facility
would need

28:48.221 --> 28:49.958
40 feet of protection?

28:49.958 --> 28:51.361
We're looking
at nuclear missile sites,

28:51.361 --> 28:53.498
deep mine facilities, NORAD.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.369
The problem is,
there's too many of 'em.

28:55.369 --> 28:56.939
So, what, dead end?

28:56.939 --> 28:58.977
Unless we get some kind
of message from God.

29:13.038 --> 29:16.144
"Ha! Ha! I'm alive, you dorks!"

29:17.848 --> 29:21.154
<i>"No thanks to you,
as I said, dorks.</i>

29:21.154 --> 29:24.360
<i>I'm going to do this
by myself."</i>

29:24.360 --> 29:26.264
Seriously, you're not even
gonna tell us where you are?

29:26.264 --> 29:28.001
Whoo!

29:30.372 --> 29:32.978
Whoa!

29:38.355 --> 29:40.392
Whoo-hoo!

29:40.392 --> 29:42.163
<i>"Just kidding.
I'm in Sochi.</i>

29:42.163 --> 29:43.165
<i>Meet you here."</i>

29:46.404 --> 29:47.406
"Dorks."

29:48.910 --> 29:51.448
Whoo-hoo!

29:51.448 --> 29:53.418
I am eternal!

29:53.418 --> 29:54.386
Whoo!

30:02.370 --> 30:03.539
So do we know
when the stewardess

30:03.539 --> 30:05.142
is coming by or whenever?

30:05.142 --> 30:06.344
There is no stewardess.

30:06.344 --> 30:09.117
Fine. Flight attendant.

30:09.117 --> 30:10.085
We can't fly commercial
because we're not supposed

30:10.085 --> 30:11.956
to be leaving the country.

30:11.956 --> 30:13.225
Well, if we pull this off,

30:13.225 --> 30:14.862
maybe they'll let us
continue to exist.

30:14.862 --> 30:17.266
Save the world
to save ourselves.

30:18.435 --> 30:19.404
Hey, you all comfortable
back here?

30:19.404 --> 30:20.907
Nope.

30:20.907 --> 30:22.176
Great, great, great.
Didn't care anyway.

30:22.176 --> 30:23.311
And it's about to get worse.

30:23.311 --> 30:24.982
We'll be coming up over land,

30:24.982 --> 30:27.052
so I'll have to hug the ground
to stay under radar.

30:27.052 --> 30:29.257
Need anything else to hug
while you're at it?

30:29.257 --> 30:30.660
Negative.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.196
- All right.
- So <i>that's</i> her type.

30:32.196 --> 30:34.066
But before I do that,
I need to know,

30:34.066 --> 30:35.904
what's that doohickey?

30:35.904 --> 30:38.041
Because if I'm carrying
some kind of chemical agent

30:38.041 --> 30:40.279
or radioactive whatever
over several countries

30:40.279 --> 30:42.517
in violation
of international law,

30:42.517 --> 30:44.588
I'd kind of like
to know about it.

30:44.588 --> 30:46.926
It might be nothing,
or it might be the thing

30:46.926 --> 30:49.197
that will save us all.

30:49.197 --> 30:51.434
Or it might be
of medium importance.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.338
I'm just gonna stand here
and blink at you

30:53.338 --> 30:55.209
and wait for you
to get less stupid.

30:55.209 --> 30:58.148
This is the Barry Matrix.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.417
Uh-huh.

30:59.417 --> 31:01.087
It contains
the root consciousness

31:01.087 --> 31:03.058
of the being known as Barry.

31:03.058 --> 31:04.494
OK, I'll bite.

31:04.494 --> 31:06.364
Who's Barry?

31:06.364 --> 31:08.235
<i>- That's me.</i>
- Hi.

31:08.235 --> 31:10.472
Well, I don't want to know
any more about this,

31:10.472 --> 31:11.609
so I'm gonna go back
to the cockpit.

31:11.609 --> 31:13.311
One question.

31:13.311 --> 31:16.317
My copilot, does he always
sing when he flies?

31:16.317 --> 31:19.958
<i>♪ He's a real pilot,
and he's flying the plane ♪</i>

31:19.958 --> 31:22.363
Yeah, I think
you make him nervous.

31:22.363 --> 31:24.333
Yeah, well, a lot of this
makes me nervous.

31:24.333 --> 31:25.369
Not you.

31:25.369 --> 31:27.339
That's a... cute dress.

31:27.339 --> 31:29.076
- Okey dokey.
- Interesting.

31:29.076 --> 31:30.613
Wait a second,
you still haven't explained

31:30.613 --> 31:32.517
why you had the Barry Matrix.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.655
Well, I can't say exactly,
but I've managed

31:34.655 --> 31:37.727
to piece together some of my
partially destroyed notes.

31:37.727 --> 31:40.633
Apparently, I started taking
night jobs for shady people

31:40.633 --> 31:42.403
- and then drugging myself--
- Whatever.

31:42.403 --> 31:44.508
None of that matters, OK?
What matters is...

31:44.508 --> 31:45.643
<i>That I am the absolute best</i>

31:45.643 --> 31:46.712
<i>at everything</i>

31:46.712 --> 31:48.516
and I have defied death itself.

31:48.516 --> 31:50.452
I feel like someone
should sit you down

31:50.452 --> 31:51.722
and explain hubris to you.

31:51.722 --> 31:53.124
Like I would listen.

31:53.124 --> 31:54.528
So all that research
you guys did,

31:54.528 --> 31:56.130
is there anything near here

31:56.130 --> 31:58.068
that qualifies as a target
for the bunker buster?

31:58.068 --> 32:00.005
There's a few
nuclear facilities,

32:00.005 --> 32:03.144
maybe a base or two,
but still too many to be sure.

32:03.144 --> 32:04.748
And if they're trying
to restart the Cold War,

32:04.748 --> 32:06.017
what would do that?

32:06.017 --> 32:07.554
Well, let's find out.

32:07.554 --> 32:10.158
Pam, Cyril, Cheryl,
go to that KGB black site

32:10.158 --> 32:11.529
to look for clues.

32:11.529 --> 32:13.231
They likely abandoned it
after Archer escaped.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.703
Secondary objective: see if
you can find my left nipple.

32:15.703 --> 32:18.008
Krieger, figure out how to
get Barry into your prototype.

32:18.008 --> 32:19.678
If Katya's around,
we're gonna need him.

32:19.678 --> 32:21.381
Ray, steal us a car.

32:21.381 --> 32:23.285
Why would you think
I know how to do that?

32:23.285 --> 32:25.523
Because all rednecks
know how to hot-wire cars.

32:25.523 --> 32:28.028
Yeah, 'cause
it's so damn fun.

32:28.028 --> 32:29.565
I'll get you a car.

32:29.565 --> 32:31.100
And the rest of us?

32:31.100 --> 32:32.704
Sochi is a playground
for Russia's rich.

32:32.704 --> 32:34.407
Archer, Zara, and I
will hit the casino

32:34.407 --> 32:36.277
to see if there are
any dignitaries in town.

32:36.277 --> 32:37.714
Maybe they're going after
important people

32:37.714 --> 32:39.183
to start the Cold War.

32:39.183 --> 32:40.520
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.589
Is there a reason
this safe house

32:41.589 --> 32:43.726
sucks absolute turbo dog shit?

32:43.726 --> 32:45.329
Yeah, uh, we're out of money.

32:45.329 --> 32:46.599
They froze our assets.

32:46.599 --> 32:48.068
I tried to move some out,

32:48.068 --> 32:49.705
but, ugh, obviously,
it wasn't much.

32:49.705 --> 32:51.675
So this is really
happening, huh?

32:51.675 --> 32:54.681
- No more us?
- Hey, it's OK, all right?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.319
Uh, let's say theoretically--
not that I want this to happen,

32:57.319 --> 33:00.593
but theoretically--we lose
and there's another Cold War?

33:00.593 --> 33:02.463
Just another
staring contest, probably.

33:02.463 --> 33:06.070
But wouldn't there be a place
for us in that world?

33:08.275 --> 33:09.611
All right, everybody.

33:09.611 --> 33:11.080
Let's fucking go.

33:21.868 --> 33:23.071
Why did we do it this way?

33:23.071 --> 33:24.407
I'm great at gambling.

33:24.407 --> 33:26.277
Yeah, and I handle the money.

33:26.277 --> 33:29.450
This sucks so much for you.

33:29.450 --> 33:31.622
- Um, you're here too.
- Oh, right.

33:31.622 --> 33:33.491
Spread out, ding-dongs.

33:33.491 --> 33:34.728
And make it last, all right?

33:34.728 --> 33:36.230
We're here to look
for intel, not gamble.

33:36.230 --> 33:38.368
Ooh, with these minimums,
we might not last long.

33:38.368 --> 33:39.605
Are you kidding me?

33:39.605 --> 33:40.773
Gambling is one
of the many things

33:40.773 --> 33:42.777
I'm literally
the best in the world at.

33:42.777 --> 33:45.115
No, no, no!

33:45.115 --> 33:46.250
These dice are loaded!

33:46.250 --> 33:48.088
I demand
an independent arbiter!

33:48.088 --> 33:49.725
I didn't want to play anyway!

33:51.227 --> 33:53.331
All right,
this is your home, Cyril.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.369
Papers in an office.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.373
This is where you shine and--

33:57.373 --> 33:58.776
ah, what do you know?

33:58.776 --> 34:00.112
There's the nipple.

34:00.112 --> 34:03.385
Because this is all I need.

34:03.385 --> 34:06.391
My luck is turning,
and it is palpable, my friends.

34:06.391 --> 34:08.796
I've never felt so alive!

34:08.796 --> 34:11.535
Did you, uh, forget
that she's a gambling addict?

34:11.535 --> 34:13.271
You know what?
I did.

34:13.271 --> 34:15.142
Oh, well.
Let's go to the bar.

34:15.142 --> 34:17.112
Hey, think I got
something here.

34:17.112 --> 34:18.816
Found a name
with background info.

34:18.816 --> 34:20.152
Looks like our target.

34:20.152 --> 34:21.254
Nice work, Cyril.

34:21.254 --> 34:22.423
Meet back at the entrance.

34:22.423 --> 34:24.561
I've got one more room
to sweep.

34:24.561 --> 34:25.830
Hey, buddy.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.399
Uh, hi?

34:27.399 --> 34:30.372
Mm, I assume you are
Archer comrade, yes?

34:30.372 --> 34:31.675
I was actually just leaving.

34:31.675 --> 34:33.546
Oh, that's too bad.

34:33.546 --> 34:35.783
You actually were not.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.554
<i>We will reconvene tomorrow
for our vote</i>

34:37.554 --> 34:39.524
<i>on private spy agencies.</i>

34:39.524 --> 34:42.262
<i>And may they be wiped
from this Earth.</i>

34:42.262 --> 34:43.699
Isn't he supposed
to be impartial?

34:43.699 --> 34:45.837
I think that is the
impartial view at this point.

34:45.837 --> 34:47.507
So what are you gonna do?

34:47.507 --> 34:48.843
I'm gonna finish
this mission.

34:48.843 --> 34:50.245
What are you gonna do?

34:50.245 --> 34:51.582
Well, I'm gonna finish
this drink.

34:52.917 --> 34:54.855
All right, let's go find Zara.

34:54.855 --> 34:56.324
What's this?

34:56.324 --> 34:57.426
I don't know.
I haven't even read it.

34:57.426 --> 34:58.662
"Sterling,
I figured you'd escape,

34:58.662 --> 35:00.298
"so I planted this on you.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.269
"It is for the best.
Slater would have killed you.

35:02.269 --> 35:04.641
"But I want you to return
to me, help me kill Slater,

35:04.641 --> 35:06.812
"and we will run
Silverwolf together.

35:06.812 --> 35:10.318
Partners, spies,
lovers for good."

35:10.318 --> 35:13.258
That was...
more than I expected.

35:13.258 --> 35:15.195
Oh, come on, you're not
actually considering that.

35:15.195 --> 35:16.732
Of course
I'm considering it, Lana.

35:16.732 --> 35:18.334
I just heard it.

35:18.334 --> 35:19.604
That's what brains do
when you hear something,

35:19.604 --> 35:21.274
especially when you've
just been offered

35:21.274 --> 35:22.711
everything you want in life.

35:22.711 --> 35:24.346
Archer, you'd really
make the world worse

35:24.346 --> 35:25.550
so it was better for you?

35:25.550 --> 35:27.186
Who says it'd be worse?

35:27.186 --> 35:29.190
Deep down, I know
you would never do that.

35:29.190 --> 35:30.560
Well, deep down,
you've always

35:30.560 --> 35:32.229
thought too highly of me.

35:32.229 --> 35:33.632
I am gonna go get Zara.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.201
Tell her I said hi.

35:37.507 --> 35:38.843
Blackjack, for the lady.

35:38.843 --> 35:40.880
Go on, have it!

35:40.880 --> 35:42.550
Suck it!
Suck it!

35:42.550 --> 35:43.853
Suck it!

35:43.853 --> 35:45.222
Come, we go.

35:45.222 --> 35:46.625
Place is going
to blow up soon

35:46.625 --> 35:47.894
to eliminate evidence.

35:49.196 --> 35:50.900
I do not like to fight lady.

35:51.969 --> 35:54.240
But since you insist,

35:54.240 --> 35:57.379
did I ever tell you
how I become KGB enforcer?

35:57.379 --> 35:59.250
We literally just met.

35:59.250 --> 36:03.491
I was in gulag in Siberia
for, mm, series of crime.

36:03.491 --> 36:05.630
Warden of prison went insane.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.803
He opened all
the cell doors and said,

36:08.803 --> 36:12.242
one man will walk out
of this prison alive.

36:12.242 --> 36:14.848
And I was that man.

36:14.848 --> 36:17.485
This is gonna be good.

36:18.655 --> 36:20.793
Whoo-hoo!

36:20.793 --> 36:22.229
Excuse me, miss.

36:22.229 --> 36:23.999
We would be honored
if you'd join us

36:23.999 --> 36:25.937
in our high-roller room.

36:25.937 --> 36:27.507
Let's do it, baby.

36:27.507 --> 36:30.245
Uh, I'm with her.

36:30.245 --> 36:32.817
Whoa, this is, like,
every military attaché

36:32.817 --> 36:34.888
and negotiator
in every Chinese and Russian

36:34.888 --> 36:36.658
briefing book I ever had.

36:36.658 --> 36:38.696
Can I?
Oh, oh, oh, can I?

36:38.696 --> 36:40.398
You did good, kid.
Go gamble.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.804
Let's roll them bones.

36:42.804 --> 36:44.006
OK, let's see.

36:44.006 --> 36:45.643
So we know
who they're targeting,

36:45.643 --> 36:47.947
but how do we find out
where they're targeting?

36:47.947 --> 36:49.551
I--I could plant a bug.

36:49.551 --> 36:51.555
Maybe I steal
a chauffeur's uniform.

36:51.555 --> 36:54.293
Or...

37:00.840 --> 37:02.977
Hey, I--

37:02.977 --> 37:04.581
I don't want to fight no more.

37:04.581 --> 37:06.652
Me neither.

37:06.652 --> 37:09.558
OK?
We stop on three, OK?

37:09.558 --> 37:10.693
One...

37:10.693 --> 37:11.862
Two...

37:11.862 --> 37:13.464
Three.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.870
Huh, I guess we could've just
always done that.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.039
<i>Da.</i>

37:17.039 --> 37:18.542
Let's get the hell
out of here.

37:18.542 --> 37:21.414
Well, hello there.

37:23.519 --> 37:24.855
Hey. Hey, you.

37:24.855 --> 37:28.428
I would like
to have sex... with you.

37:28.428 --> 37:31.334
Give me the phone number
of where you are staying.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.670
No!

37:32.670 --> 37:33.839
This is the greatest
streak in history.

37:33.839 --> 37:34.875
It can't end now.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.010
Just give me one more chip.

37:36.010 --> 37:38.414
One more chip.

37:44.059 --> 37:45.997
- Was that me?
- No, that was me.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.634
Oh, OK.

37:47.634 --> 37:49.336
Do I know him?

37:49.336 --> 37:53.612
Archer?

37:53.612 --> 37:54.681
Archer!

37:56.017 --> 37:57.385
God damn it.

38:02.095 --> 38:03.766
[Lan

38:03.766 --> 38:04.935
He's our guy.

38:04.935 --> 38:06.638
Structural engineering professor

38:06.638 --> 38:09.476
who also designed the Sochi dam
that opened last year.

38:09.476 --> 38:11.848
So they're gonna use this guy
plus the bunker buster

38:11.848 --> 38:13.552
to, what, blow up the dam?

38:13.552 --> 38:14.988
Sure looks that way.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.892
Kill the Chinese and Russian
delegations with it.

38:16.892 --> 38:18.094
Hey, what about
that phone number you got

38:18.094 --> 38:19.831
from the Russian general?

38:19.831 --> 38:21.935
Well, if we stop Silverwolf
from taking the professor,

38:21.935 --> 38:23.404
we'll have the credibility
for the Russians

38:23.404 --> 38:24.941
and the Chinese
to actually believe us.

38:24.941 --> 38:27.814
So they want to kill
the Russians and the Chinese

38:27.814 --> 38:29.450
and blame America?

38:29.450 --> 38:31.555
And I bet Slater knows
exactly how to do that.

38:31.555 --> 38:32.857
Jesus.

38:32.857 --> 38:34.360
Shit, Ray, think you
could've stolen a car

38:34.360 --> 38:35.863
with actual shocks?

38:35.863 --> 38:38.134
Well, I couldn't exactly
give it a test-drive,

38:38.134 --> 38:39.704
you ungrateful--

38:39.704 --> 38:41.541
Ah. So where's Archer?

38:41.541 --> 38:43.077
I don't know.

38:43.077 --> 38:45.516
He got a letter from Katya.
I--I think--

38:45.516 --> 38:46.785
You think
he's been compromised?

38:46.785 --> 38:49.056
No way.
No... way.

38:49.056 --> 38:52.496
I mean... some way.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.466
We can't assume
anything right now.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.170
We're gonna have
to do this without him.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.141
Hey, let's not
get distracted, team.

38:58.141 --> 39:00.613
Let's just grab Gregaro
before Silverwolf does.

39:00.613 --> 39:02.049
Oh-ho, sure.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.688
Just gonna slide
right into his spot, huh, Zara?

39:04.688 --> 39:06.057
Oh, lay off.

39:06.057 --> 39:07.827
It's not like he never
abandoned us before.

39:07.827 --> 39:09.631
After Katya died?

39:09.631 --> 39:10.833
Come on!

39:10.833 --> 39:12.135
Give the guy a break.

39:12.135 --> 39:14.073
OK, now I'm confused.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.582
It doesn't matter.

39:18.582 --> 39:21.153
What matters is that we do
our jobs and save the world,

39:21.153 --> 39:23.726
and that's only gonna happen
if we stick together.

39:23.726 --> 39:26.565
God damn it, Ray!

39:28.569 --> 39:30.806
Who here speaks English?

39:30.806 --> 39:32.910
Wow.
Thanks, cultural imperialism.

39:32.910 --> 39:34.514
We're here to prevent
a kidnapping.

39:34.514 --> 39:36.083
Pam, Zara.

39:36.885 --> 39:40.826
Um, it sure seems like
you are kidnapping me.

39:40.826 --> 39:42.062
We're really not.

39:42.062 --> 39:43.498
I would like to emphasize
that we are

39:43.498 --> 39:45.201
definitely not kidnapping him.

39:45.201 --> 39:48.041
We are taking him
to a safe, secret location.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.744
Sounds like kidnapping.

39:49.744 --> 39:52.082
So there's important
but subtle differences

39:52.082 --> 39:54.554
between what we're doing
and kidnapping,

39:54.554 --> 39:55.956
and, obviously,
I don't have time

39:55.956 --> 39:57.994
to go into those
in the middle of...

39:57.994 --> 39:59.597
what looks like
a kidnapping.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.100
Thank you, everyone.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.135
Have a good night.

40:03.639 --> 40:04.674
Hey, I don't want to jinx it,

40:04.674 --> 40:06.812
but all in all, not that hard.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.057
Oh, damn.
That's really smart.

40:13.057 --> 40:15.161
- What?
- We're part of the plan.

40:15.161 --> 40:17.800
Oh, crap, the Americans
just kidnapped him,

40:17.800 --> 40:19.236
and then they take him from us.

40:19.236 --> 40:21.207
So wait.
Who are these people?

40:21.207 --> 40:23.011
The actual kidnappers.

40:23.011 --> 40:24.681
So more of you guys?

40:24.681 --> 40:26.752
I already
almost explained this.

40:26.752 --> 40:28.021
Alley, that way.

40:28.021 --> 40:29.256
Move it.

40:33.966 --> 40:35.836
What now?

40:37.974 --> 40:40.111
Get in!

40:42.884 --> 40:44.654
I'd like you all to know
that this goes against

40:44.654 --> 40:45.923
every instinct I have.

40:45.923 --> 40:47.560
That is so sweet.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.496
So you chose
the lame-ass world.

40:49.496 --> 40:50.800
No.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.670
I chose... you guys.

40:52.670 --> 40:54.073
Look out!

41:05.663 --> 41:07.867
I am sorry that it
worked out this way.

41:07.867 --> 41:10.038
But the next time I see you,

41:10.038 --> 41:13.645
I'm going to kill you all.

41:15.716 --> 41:18.187
So just to circle back, I--

41:18.187 --> 41:19.557
I read your letter.

41:19.557 --> 41:21.527
Is it too late to change sides?

41:23.832 --> 41:24.800
What?

41:28.307 --> 41:31.514
<i>This is the best moment
of my life!</i>

41:33.050 --> 41:34.788
That is wildly out of context.

41:34.788 --> 41:36.725
This is why no one
trusts the UN.

41:36.725 --> 41:38.662
<i>Consider his face
as you cast your vote</i>

41:38.662 --> 41:40.666
<i>to outlaw private spying.</i>

41:40.666 --> 41:44.774
<i>A man in wanton disregard
of the international order,</i>

41:44.774 --> 41:49.818
<i>beholden only to himself
and his own twisted ego.</i>

41:49.818 --> 41:51.721
Oh, and now you're
complimenting me?

41:51.721 --> 41:53.759
Not looking great here.

41:53.759 --> 41:55.696
What, the fact that we're all
about to be unemployable

41:55.696 --> 41:56.998
or the mission?

41:56.998 --> 41:58.267
So since you brought up
the mission--

41:58.267 --> 42:00.004
<i>Well, at least
you're not a vacuum</i>

42:00.004 --> 42:01.975
<i>strapped to a jack-off machine.</i>

42:01.975 --> 42:04.012
Hey, some people would pay
big money for that.

42:04.012 --> 42:05.649
Me!
I'm that people.

42:05.649 --> 42:07.119
<i>Don't you have some kind
of more appropriate</i>

42:07.119 --> 42:08.956
<i>attire for me?</i>

42:08.956 --> 42:11.795
I mean, yeah,
if you want that.

42:11.795 --> 42:14.767
Whoa, so is that a spy suit
or a gimp suit?

42:14.767 --> 42:16.137
Dealer's choice.

42:16.137 --> 42:18.141
To review:
Slater and his old-ass spies

42:18.141 --> 42:19.577
want to blow up the dam,

42:19.577 --> 42:21.147
killing a bunch
of Russians and Chinese.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.317
Then he'll blame it on the U.S.
and restart the Cold War,

42:23.317 --> 42:25.288
because he thinks it's better
to run into the past

42:25.288 --> 42:26.758
than face the future.

42:26.758 --> 42:28.729
Can't we just tell the dam?

42:28.729 --> 42:29.964
Slater's been
calling in bomb threats

42:29.964 --> 42:31.167
for the last six months,

42:31.167 --> 42:33.070
so everyone
just ignores them now.

42:33.070 --> 42:36.010
God, it sucks so much that he's
actually clever sometimes.

42:36.010 --> 42:37.613
Archer, Zara, Ray,

42:37.613 --> 42:39.283
you'll go in posing
as dam inspectors.

42:39.283 --> 42:42.623
Infiltrate, locate,
and defuse that bomb.

42:42.623 --> 42:45.361
And is there a plan to defeat
the undefeatable death robot?

42:45.361 --> 42:47.199
The Barry prototype!

42:47.199 --> 42:49.102
I'll just need
a massive power surge

42:49.102 --> 42:50.739
to jump his mind in there.

42:50.739 --> 42:52.877
So we'll hook him up
to one of the dam's turbines.

42:52.877 --> 42:55.148
<i>Then I will become invincible.</i>

42:55.148 --> 42:56.618
Not if you're still
wearing that.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.789
- Mm. That bum, though.
- What about me?

42:58.789 --> 43:00.124
Lot to be said
for your bum too.

43:00.124 --> 43:02.229
Pam, you and Cyril
will be team two.

43:02.229 --> 43:03.999
Now, it's not on any map,
but there's a shantytown

43:03.999 --> 43:05.736
that's right in the path
of the water.

43:05.736 --> 43:07.239
You need to convince them
to evacuate.

43:07.239 --> 43:08.775
Oh, come on!

43:08.775 --> 43:11.146
Why me?
I want to do the shooty stuff.

43:11.146 --> 43:14.019
I know it sucks, but you're
the only one everyone likes.

43:14.019 --> 43:15.923
Yeah, it's not like
they're gonna listen to Cyril.

43:15.923 --> 43:18.361
Hey.
I have useful skills.

43:18.361 --> 43:20.198
Like what, catching strays?

43:20.198 --> 43:23.137
If we can pull this off,
maybe the UN doesn't ban us.

43:23.137 --> 43:24.941
Look, what's most important

43:24.941 --> 43:27.112
is making the world
a better place,

43:27.112 --> 43:29.984
which is what we have
been doing all along.

43:29.984 --> 43:31.855
<i>All along what?</i>

43:31.855 --> 43:34.661
Hey. Hey, everyone.
Relax, OK?

43:34.661 --> 43:36.163
Look, I feel for you guys.

43:36.163 --> 43:38.100
Not everyone
has a skill set like me,

43:38.100 --> 43:41.942
you know, able to thrive solo
in literally any situation.

43:41.942 --> 43:44.012
And thank you
for that compelling summary

43:44.012 --> 43:45.281
of your dickfaceitude.

43:45.281 --> 43:47.052
Guys, it's over.

43:47.052 --> 43:49.323
Did you think you were gonna do
this dubiously legal job

43:49.323 --> 43:50.358
for the rest of your lives?

43:50.358 --> 43:52.162
Just be like me,

43:52.162 --> 43:53.832
the fully actualized person
who's able

43:53.832 --> 43:56.003
to express my feelings
by doing terrible things

43:56.003 --> 43:58.742
to some presumably
bad guy's body!

43:58.742 --> 44:00.980
Lana, briefing. Finish.

44:02.984 --> 44:04.988
There is no
tactical retreat here.

44:04.988 --> 44:07.693
So if we can get inside
with the disguises, great.

44:07.693 --> 44:09.998
If we can't, these will
uncomplicate things

44:09.998 --> 44:11.400
very quickly.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.269
Wait, how did you know
to bring that?

44:12.269 --> 44:13.839
Damn it, Archer.

44:13.839 --> 44:16.176
After all this time,
can you finally admit

44:16.176 --> 44:17.980
I am good at my goddamn job?

44:18.982 --> 44:20.018
No.

44:20.018 --> 44:21.687
But it's a soft no.

44:22.823 --> 44:24.793
Come on, that's progress!

44:29.904 --> 44:31.073
<i>Dam Team in position.</i>

44:31.073 --> 44:32.910
Team Shantytown, report.

44:32.910 --> 44:34.847
Can we have
a cooler name, like Team--

44:34.847 --> 44:36.918
Nope.
Here we go.

44:36.918 --> 44:38.922
One shot,
or it's our last mission.

44:38.922 --> 44:40.358
<i>In any number of ways.</i>

44:40.358 --> 44:43.064
And on that cheerful note,
it's go time.

44:43.064 --> 44:44.466
Surprise dam inspection team,

44:44.466 --> 44:46.136
under UN safety orders.

44:46.136 --> 44:47.907
We're gonna need access
to the facility.

44:49.176 --> 44:50.512
I'm sorry, what?

44:50.512 --> 44:51.848
Are you challenging us?

44:51.848 --> 44:53.217
Look, I know people
see us at the UN

44:53.217 --> 44:54.988
as dull, incompetent clods.

44:54.988 --> 44:58.194
But we also happen to be
tremendous assholes.

44:58.194 --> 44:59.831
No, it's not that.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.102
Another team of inspectors
arrived an hour ago.

45:02.102 --> 45:05.375
And these inspectors, hottest
Russian woman you've ever seen

45:05.375 --> 45:07.078
and the world's biggest douche?

45:07.078 --> 45:08.447
He insulted my shoes

45:08.447 --> 45:11.287
and implied I had relations
with a reindeer.

45:15.061 --> 45:17.165
Warn us before you do that!

45:17.165 --> 45:19.136
I totally cocked an eyebrow.

45:19.136 --> 45:22.275
So nonverbally tell them
they're all about to die?

45:22.275 --> 45:24.814
No, but we don't want to get
into a whole back-and-forth.

45:24.814 --> 45:26.250
It might get hostile.

45:26.250 --> 45:30.091
So... you are here
to tell us we must go?

45:30.091 --> 45:31.828
Oh, thank goodness.

45:31.828 --> 45:33.331
This is such a relief.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.234
We thought that this
would be difficult, but...

45:36.838 --> 45:38.207
...we can see that it won't be

45:38.207 --> 45:41.280
because we would never
ask you to leave.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.384
Cargo shorts, nice.

45:43.384 --> 45:46.791
Lots of storage in those
bad boys, am I right?

45:48.194 --> 45:50.264
Lana, if you've got
some kind of secret plan,

45:50.264 --> 45:52.102
now is probably the time.

45:52.102 --> 45:53.471
Cheryl, execute.

45:53.471 --> 45:55.174
What?
Who is this?

45:55.174 --> 45:56.443
Just kidding.

45:59.383 --> 46:00.919
All right, you've got
a window without police.

46:00.919 --> 46:02.055
Cheryl's running distraction

46:02.055 --> 46:03.992
and... hopefully
not killing anyone.

46:03.992 --> 46:05.596
I'd say may God have mercy
on their souls,

46:05.596 --> 46:07.967
but what kind of god
would create Cheryl?

46:07.967 --> 46:10.939
Gaze upon me!

46:11.608 --> 46:13.578
Hey, guys, be careful
when you leave.

46:13.578 --> 46:15.949
There's glass everywhere
for some reason.

46:20.859 --> 46:22.228
Quick, get Barry
up and running!

46:22.228 --> 46:25.001
<i>Yeah, give me
that unimaginable power.</i>

46:25.001 --> 46:26.470
<i>Bring the rain of pain.</i>

46:30.278 --> 46:32.048
<i>What? No.
I'm cool.</i>

46:32.048 --> 46:33.985
<i>- I'm cool.</i>
- Uh-huh.

46:35.387 --> 46:38.060
Please, I must implore you.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.362
No, you mustn't.

46:39.362 --> 46:41.133
Because she can snap
your pencil neck

46:41.133 --> 46:43.572
like, well, a pencil, I guess.

46:43.572 --> 46:45.509
Now, that's not a pencil,

46:45.509 --> 46:48.214
but I think
the idea translates.

46:48.214 --> 46:49.917
<i>Terrorists have taken the turbine hall.</i>

46:49.917 --> 46:51.286
<i>Do not engage.</i>

46:51.286 --> 46:52.623
Well, I was wondering
when those dorks

46:52.623 --> 46:55.228
would make
their doomed stupid gesture.

46:55.228 --> 46:57.399
Katya, bring them to me!

46:57.399 --> 46:59.336
Uh, as a request
and not an order,

46:59.336 --> 47:02.041
because we are equal partners.

47:02.041 --> 47:04.346
Man, you can take
the unkillable murder bot

47:04.346 --> 47:06.283
out of the woman,
but you can't take the woman

47:06.283 --> 47:08.320
out of the unkillable
murder bot.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.957
Am I right?

47:09.957 --> 47:12.530
We built this dam
with our hands.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.466
Our great achievement.

47:14.466 --> 47:17.506
We love it and never wish
to be away from it.

47:17.506 --> 47:18.975
That is all very reasonable.

47:18.975 --> 47:20.178
Well, I guess
we should go, Pam.

47:20.178 --> 47:21.213
Reasonable?

47:21.213 --> 47:22.348
When that dam comes down,

47:22.348 --> 47:23.919
you'll all be reasonably dead.

47:25.221 --> 47:26.991
Come on, Krieger!

47:26.991 --> 47:28.895
Look, man, this surge is gonna
blow out the Barry matrix.

47:28.895 --> 47:31.166
So if you die after this,
you die, die.

47:31.166 --> 47:32.134
<i>Do it.</i>

47:43.992 --> 47:46.230
He's alive.
Alive!

47:52.175 --> 47:54.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:55.214 --> 47:56.450
Krieger!

47:56.450 --> 47:58.353
What?
I said it was a prototype.

48:03.263 --> 48:04.967
I told you not to get involved.

48:04.967 --> 48:07.405
No, You told us if you
saw us again, you'd kill us.

48:07.405 --> 48:09.242
Not a helpful clarification.

48:09.242 --> 48:11.313
You know Slater's
gonna betray you, right?

48:11.313 --> 48:12.983
Even if he doesn't
have a reason.

48:12.983 --> 48:14.687
Just out of
inherent dickishness.

48:14.687 --> 48:16.724
But for now,
he's a useful dick.

48:16.724 --> 48:18.662
As you were once, my Sterling.

48:18.662 --> 48:20.264
Barry?

48:20.264 --> 48:22.035
What... happened to you?

48:22.035 --> 48:25.374
Well, first I turned evil.
Then I killed you.

48:25.374 --> 48:27.245
Then you were my girlfriend.
Then I died.

48:27.245 --> 48:28.548
Then there was a bunch of me.

48:28.548 --> 48:30.451
Then I got split
into good and evil,

48:30.451 --> 48:33.257
and then I was a refrigerator
and killed evil me.

48:33.257 --> 48:35.127
And now...

48:35.127 --> 48:37.265
I'm gonna
kick your ass, I think.

48:42.141 --> 48:43.277
Oof.

48:43.277 --> 48:44.547
Like, seriously.

48:44.547 --> 48:45.682
Oof, guys.

48:45.682 --> 48:47.018
Damn it, Krieger.

48:47.018 --> 48:48.320
Oh, sorry
the sentient robot

48:48.320 --> 48:49.489
I built
in defiance of God

48:49.489 --> 48:51.761
isn't up
to your standards, Ray.

48:58.407 --> 49:00.211
Hyah!

49:00.211 --> 49:02.081
Oh, robot legs.

49:02.081 --> 49:03.618
- Right.
- Kick pants!

49:05.221 --> 49:07.025
Zara, get out of here.
Get to Lana.

49:07.025 --> 49:08.562
I am not leaving a fight.

49:08.562 --> 49:10.632
God damn it,
I never lose, obviously.

49:10.632 --> 49:12.335
But this...
isn't looking great.

49:12.335 --> 49:15.441
So find Lana
and do what she says.

49:15.441 --> 49:17.613
Ag--because
she's the smart one.

49:17.613 --> 49:20.351
How much personal growth
do you need? Go!

49:20.351 --> 49:22.590
Had to pick this moment
to be noble, huh?

49:22.590 --> 49:25.194
Yeah, I already regret it,
but I have a plan.

49:25.194 --> 49:26.463
Ray, grab this cable.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.334
We'll zap her
when she gets out.

49:28.334 --> 49:30.204
Hey, quick heads-up.

49:30.204 --> 49:32.576
Those aren't electrified anymore.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.584
And we're from
a private spy company,

49:36.584 --> 49:38.722
and there is a bomb
planted in the dam!

49:38.722 --> 49:41.093
We've heard
bomb threats before.

49:41.093 --> 49:43.197
And how would you
know that anyway?

49:43.197 --> 49:46.103
'Cause we're the ones who maybe
accidentally gave it to them.

49:46.103 --> 49:48.742
Wait, you are
the guys from Rio!

49:48.742 --> 49:50.244
I saw you on TV.

49:50.244 --> 49:51.614
Y'all have a TV here?

49:51.614 --> 49:53.117
Is it behind the squalor?

49:53.117 --> 49:55.087
We've got more than that.

49:55.087 --> 49:56.256
Let me show you something.

49:57.391 --> 49:59.095
Jeezy Petes.

49:59.095 --> 50:00.364
Ha!

50:00.364 --> 50:02.770
Welcome to a world of pa--

50:02.770 --> 50:03.772
Ow!

50:07.746 --> 50:09.817
Yeah!
Go, tiny Barry!

50:09.817 --> 50:11.219
Yeah, please don't
call me that, OK?

50:11.219 --> 50:13.290
Get off!
Ugh!

50:13.290 --> 50:15.094
Oh!

50:15.094 --> 50:16.564
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God!

50:16.564 --> 50:18.568
Ow.
Oh, man.

50:18.568 --> 50:20.639
Oh, no, man.

50:20.639 --> 50:22.474
That's not good.

50:23.076 --> 50:26.383
I-I don't suppose those
are the red eyes of love

50:26.383 --> 50:27.786
you're looking at me with.

50:27.786 --> 50:30.257
<i>Holy shitsnacks,</i>

50:30.257 --> 50:33.732
you're stealing power
from the dam to mine crypto?

50:33.732 --> 50:35.468
They owe us.

50:35.468 --> 50:37.539
We cannot just leave
this all behind.

50:37.539 --> 50:39.242
Well, that's all great,

50:39.242 --> 50:41.280
but you're all gonna die
if you don't leave.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.652
Without this,
what is out there for us?

50:43.652 --> 50:45.154
There's something better
out there.

50:45.154 --> 50:46.591
You've got to believe that.

50:46.591 --> 50:48.260
You've done
incredible work here,

50:48.260 --> 50:50.699
maybe the most important work
of your lives.

50:50.699 --> 50:54.439
But maybe, just maybe...
it isn't.

50:54.439 --> 50:57.145
And how great would it be
if it isn't

50:57.145 --> 50:59.349
and the best
is still out there?

50:59.349 --> 51:01.219
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, uh, do I have

51:01.219 --> 51:02.690
- to be here for this?
- Shh!

51:02.690 --> 51:04.225
If I get your money out,

51:04.225 --> 51:05.562
can you convince
your people to get out?

51:05.562 --> 51:06.864
You can do that?

51:06.864 --> 51:09.570
I happen to be
a kick-ass accountant.

51:09.570 --> 51:11.273
Unlicensed.

51:11.273 --> 51:14.212
Look, if you can do that,
we will give you guys a cut.

51:14.212 --> 51:15.549
<i>Pam,
I've lost contact with Archer.</i>

51:15.549 --> 51:16.684
- What?
- <i>I need you to--</i>

51:16.684 --> 51:18.588
Don't worry.
Aunt Pammy's coming.

51:18.588 --> 51:20.458
Find me a back way
into that place.

51:20.458 --> 51:22.295
And get me some wheels.

51:23.297 --> 51:27.171
Pampaaaage!

51:28.608 --> 51:30.177
I can't believe

51:30.177 --> 51:31.614
- you're doing this.
- What?

51:31.614 --> 51:33.618
Tying you up is really
the established move here.

51:33.618 --> 51:35.221
Not that, the dam.

51:35.221 --> 51:36.724
You're really gonna wipe out
a whole village?

51:36.724 --> 51:38.728
What village?
There's no village.

51:38.728 --> 51:41.466
We're just going to kill
a bunch of old generals.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.203
The world should thank us.

51:43.203 --> 51:45.374
It's not gonna be on the map
because it's a squatter

51:45.374 --> 51:47.579
town of workers
who built the dam.

51:47.579 --> 51:49.382
Slater, there's a village?

51:49.382 --> 51:50.585
Oh, come on.

51:52.188 --> 51:54.593
Look, betrayal is a subtle art,

51:54.593 --> 51:57.398
and you guys are just really
messing up my timing here.

51:57.398 --> 51:59.804
Though I guess that's all
water under the bridge.

51:59.804 --> 52:03.343
Or, you know,
over your lifeless corpses.

52:03.343 --> 52:05.414
I can't move.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.351
Yeah, well, perils
of having a switch

52:07.351 --> 52:08.655
that does that, honey.

52:08.655 --> 52:10.391
Slater, why are you
even doing this?

52:10.391 --> 52:11.894
How does the Cold War help you?

52:11.894 --> 52:14.232
Come on, I've been
preparing this for years.

52:14.232 --> 52:15.836
I've got moles
planted everywhere.

52:15.836 --> 52:17.740
I'll be selling information
both ways,

52:17.740 --> 52:19.376
undermining governments.

52:19.376 --> 52:21.480
Everything goes through me.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.584
I am the new world order.

52:24.653 --> 52:27.225
OK, so... enjoy exploding.

52:27.225 --> 52:28.828
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna.

52:28.828 --> 52:30.297
Really?

52:30.297 --> 52:31.433
It's the last comeback
of your life

52:31.433 --> 52:33.772
and that's all you've got?

52:33.772 --> 52:35.842
That actually makes me
a little sad, but--

52:35.842 --> 52:37.646
and immediately happy again.

52:41.286 --> 52:43.558
- Where is everyone?
- Still inside.

52:43.558 --> 52:45.394
It wasn't looking good,
so Archer sent me up here.

52:45.394 --> 52:47.265
What?
We have to go get them.

52:47.265 --> 52:49.402
Lana, wait.
That's not why he sent me.

52:49.402 --> 52:51.373
Didn't you say making the world
a better place

52:51.373 --> 52:52.543
was most important?

52:52.543 --> 52:54.446
What?
Come on, I just said that!

52:54.446 --> 52:55.949
I didn't think
it would actually come up!

52:55.949 --> 52:57.418
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

52:57.418 --> 52:59.657
but trust him,
because he trusts you.

52:59.657 --> 53:01.727
- What's the plan?
- OK, all right.

53:01.727 --> 53:03.531
We set up an ambush.
If the dam breaks,

53:03.531 --> 53:04.867
they don't want to be down,
so they're gonna go up.

53:04.867 --> 53:06.671
Stop Slater.
Get the detonator.

53:06.671 --> 53:08.440
Prevent the Cold War.
I'm in.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.677
Ugh, I just wish
we had some backup.

53:09.677 --> 53:10.846
We do.

53:10.846 --> 53:12.281
Cheryl?

53:12.281 --> 53:14.854
Lana, stop dicking around.

53:14.854 --> 53:17.826
Could you imagine if Cheryl
was the only backup at--

53:17.826 --> 53:20.699
oh, shit,
you're serious.

53:20.699 --> 53:22.569
No, no.

53:22.569 --> 53:24.540
It doesn't end like this.

53:50.357 --> 53:51.594
Sorry, guys.

53:51.594 --> 53:52.996
I can't make it.

53:52.996 --> 53:54.499
I got you, little fella.

53:54.499 --> 53:56.637
Pam!
Ugh, don't call me that.

53:56.637 --> 53:58.508
Ooh!

54:04.319 --> 54:05.321
Ow!

54:05.321 --> 54:06.924
That really hurt.

54:06.924 --> 54:08.862
Stupid ground.

54:08.862 --> 54:10.999
God damn it, Pam.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.636
Why are you always the best?

54:12.636 --> 54:14.405
Why don't you ask your face?

54:15.775 --> 54:18.347
Barry, I'm so sorry.

54:18.347 --> 54:19.517
Hey, babe.

54:19.517 --> 54:21.754
You look really big.

54:26.764 --> 54:27.966
A bit outgunned here.

54:27.966 --> 54:29.570
- Cover me!
- Cover you?

54:29.570 --> 54:30.772
Cover you where?

54:32.609 --> 54:33.912
I did it!

54:33.912 --> 54:36.049
I really did it!
Whoo-hoo!

54:36.049 --> 54:37.485
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

54:37.485 --> 54:38.755
Oh, right, death!

54:38.755 --> 54:40.892
Barry, hold on to my CPU.

54:50.177 --> 54:52.549
We have
merged our consciousness.

54:52.549 --> 54:56.524
Now witness the true power
of Katbar.

54:56.524 --> 54:57.960
- Left.
- No, no. I'm leading.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.530
- Left, then right.
- I'm leading.

54:59.530 --> 55:02.569
This is like the worst
three-legged race of all time.

55:02.569 --> 55:05.942
Slater, you are gonna
give me that detonator,

55:05.942 --> 55:08.648
or I'm gonna pull
your trachea out

55:08.648 --> 55:10.518
through your dick hole!

55:11.988 --> 55:14.660
Detonator?
You think there's a detonator?

55:14.660 --> 55:16.062
What am I, an amateur?

55:16.062 --> 55:17.566
Jesus, Lana.

55:17.566 --> 55:19.536
You use detonators
when you want there to be

55:19.536 --> 55:21.674
an option to explode or not.

55:21.674 --> 55:23.945
You use a timer when you--

55:43.818 --> 55:45.956
That sound you just heard
was the dam bursting.

55:45.956 --> 55:48.460
Get everyone out now!

55:48.460 --> 55:50.565
No, I'm not a lady.

55:56.944 --> 55:58.113
Hasn't this guy
ever heard of a buffer

55:58.113 --> 55:59.850
on his goddamn time bomb?

55:59.850 --> 56:01.520
Ah, don't worry.

56:01.520 --> 56:03.591
I'll tell everyone
how I tried to stop you.

56:03.591 --> 56:05.662
Enjoy prison, buddy.

56:05.662 --> 56:07.766
You used the "enjoy" line
already, Slater!

56:07.766 --> 56:10.605
- Archer, don't do it.
- Who would I be if I didn't?

56:10.605 --> 56:12.509
Besides, you know I'm the best
when saving the world

56:12.509 --> 56:14.846
happens to coincide
with being super petty.

56:25.735 --> 56:27.773
Goodbye, Archer.

56:27.773 --> 56:30.745
No!
I... hate... goodbyes!

56:35.154 --> 56:36.791
Help me!

56:36.791 --> 56:39.095
Why would I do that?

56:39.095 --> 56:40.565
Because I know...

56:40.565 --> 56:41.967
- who your father is.
- What?

56:41.967 --> 56:43.203
What, you don't think the CIA

56:43.203 --> 56:45.675
ever ran your DNA
through our database?

56:45.675 --> 56:47.879
I-I mean,
that does accord

56:47.879 --> 56:49.917
with my sense
of my own importance.

56:49.917 --> 56:51.887
I looked it up
and deleted it.

56:51.887 --> 56:53.056
I'm the only one who knows.

56:53.056 --> 56:54.626
I did it for leverage.

56:54.626 --> 56:56.564
God, it sucks
that you're clever sometimes!

56:56.564 --> 56:58.634
Hey, if you don't save me,

56:58.634 --> 57:00.538
you'll never know
your father's identity.

57:05.180 --> 57:07.853
Slater, turns out,
I don't need to know.

57:07.853 --> 57:12.562
Oh, that is such horseshiiiiit!

57:12.562 --> 57:14.967
But hey, enjoy falling.

57:14.967 --> 57:18.641
Hey, Slater,
now I'm <i>your</i> daddy!

57:18.641 --> 57:20.177
Ha!
Wait, no, didn't say that.

57:20.177 --> 57:21.681
No one heard it.

57:21.681 --> 57:23.183
It was the "enjoy" line
and then nothing.

57:23.183 --> 57:24.886
That's what ended it.
That's all I said.

57:25.888 --> 57:27.058
<i>And the final tally:</i>

57:27.058 --> 57:30.064
<i>172 to 21.</i>

57:30.064 --> 57:33.136
<i>Private spy agencies
are outlawed.</i>

57:33.136 --> 57:35.074
God damn it.

57:38.581 --> 57:40.719
Uh, little surprise
for you all.

57:40.719 --> 57:43.691
We got a cut
of that shantytown's crypto,

57:43.691 --> 57:46.564
and we're all... millionaires!

57:47.699 --> 57:49.703
What? No!

57:49.703 --> 57:51.540
Sell.
Sell, sell, sell!

57:51.540 --> 57:55.214
Well, we--we all
have... a little bit of money.

57:55.214 --> 57:57.084
- All right.
- Hooray.

57:57.084 --> 57:58.286
OK, here's my pitch.

57:58.286 --> 58:00.825
We use your money
to fund my research

58:00.825 --> 58:03.965
to colonize the moon...
with werewolves.

58:03.965 --> 58:06.837
Think about it.
The moon is always full there.

58:06.837 --> 58:09.977
Ooh.
I'm liking it.

58:09.977 --> 58:14.185
You are the biggest bunch
of undisciplined, petty weirdos

58:14.185 --> 58:16.055
I have ever met.

58:16.055 --> 58:19.596
And, my God,
it has been an honor.

58:19.596 --> 58:21.299
Thousand pound
this is a bull's-eye.

58:21.299 --> 58:23.904
Make it five!

58:24.405 --> 58:26.242
Ow!
Damn it, Zara!

58:26.242 --> 58:27.979
Yes! That counts!

58:27.979 --> 58:30.117
Guys.
Guys!

58:30.117 --> 58:32.756
Hey, jackasses!

58:32.756 --> 58:34.593
OK, sorry.
Sorry, that was harsh.

58:34.593 --> 58:35.795
I just wanted to say
that, you know,

58:35.795 --> 58:37.298
we did something
really good today.

58:37.298 --> 58:39.603
And yeah, we fucked up before...

58:39.603 --> 58:40.905
a lot.

58:40.905 --> 58:42.776
But we've done
a lot of good too.

58:42.776 --> 58:45.047
And--and maybe we all gave up
a lot of stuff to do it,

58:45.047 --> 58:47.619
you know, like--
like normal lives and...

58:47.619 --> 58:51.226
healthy relationships
and not having all these scars.

58:51.226 --> 58:53.965
But the thing is,
I'm proud of these scars.

58:53.965 --> 58:55.334
I'm proud of us.

58:55.334 --> 58:57.672
And I know Malory
would be too.

58:57.672 --> 58:58.875
But you know what?

58:58.875 --> 59:00.144
Life is not over yet, OK?

59:00.144 --> 59:01.781
You guys are gonna do
great new things

59:01.781 --> 59:03.350
you haven't even thought of.

59:03.350 --> 59:05.622
And--and so am I.

59:05.622 --> 59:07.024
And I'm trying really hard
to convince myself

59:07.024 --> 59:08.293
of that right now, but I--

59:08.293 --> 59:09.930
I really think I believe it.

59:09.930 --> 59:11.299
And you should too.

59:11.299 --> 59:14.038
'Cause I love you guys,
all of you.

59:14.038 --> 59:15.842
And you deserve
all of the happiness

59:15.842 --> 59:18.180
this fucked-up world
can give you.

59:19.850 --> 59:21.186
I would miss you guys so much

59:21.186 --> 59:23.958
if I didn't have clones
of all of you.

59:23.958 --> 59:25.728
Hey, Archer,
what are you gonna--

59:25.728 --> 59:27.064
Archer?

59:27.064 --> 59:28.266
Where'd he go?

59:31.841 --> 59:35.347
- Oh, Sterling.
- Oh. Oh, Katya.

59:35.347 --> 59:36.382
It's even better
than I imagined.

59:38.086 --> 59:39.055
This is mind-blowing.

59:39.055 --> 59:41.059
I mean, wow.

59:41.059 --> 59:42.796
Barry, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

59:42.796 --> 59:44.198
Oh, but it's so different.

59:44.198 --> 59:45.668
Stop talking!

59:47.839 --> 59:49.676
OK, start talking again.

59:49.676 --> 59:51.814
That was actually
really working for me.

59:56.289 --> 59:58.861
- Whoa-ho! Oh, yeah!
- Oh!

01:00:08.079 --> 01:00:09.683
Not sure
what you're looking for,

01:00:09.683 --> 01:00:10.952
but we're closed.

01:00:10.952 --> 01:00:13.223
Oh, I'm looking for you,
Ms. Kane.

01:00:13.223 --> 01:00:16.697
Have you seen
Sterling Archer recently?

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:17.832
Have you?

01:00:17.832 --> 01:00:19.302
He disappeared after Sochi.

01:00:19.302 --> 01:00:21.406
I hear he's been on quite
the tear of rogue espionage.

01:00:21.406 --> 01:00:24.713
Yes, well, we were hoping
you might help us with that.

01:00:24.713 --> 01:00:26.382
And "we" is?

01:00:26.382 --> 01:00:29.990
I represent a new joint
CIA-MI6 coordinating group.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.127
Private spying
may be a thing of the past,

01:00:32.127 --> 01:00:34.398
but the world's still
a complicated place.

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:37.137
Sometimes flexible solutions
are needed.

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:39.275
That's who "we" is.

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:41.312
So private spying is dead,

01:00:41.312 --> 01:00:43.985
but sometimes you need
someone nonpublic.

01:00:43.985 --> 01:00:45.187
Precisely!

01:00:45.187 --> 01:00:48.895
And Mr. Archer...
is a problem for us.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.397
Ha, try having
a kid with him.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.434
We can't have him
out there freelancing.

01:00:52.434 --> 01:00:54.405
Too chaotic, too messy.

01:00:54.405 --> 01:00:56.409
No sense of perspective.

01:00:56.409 --> 01:00:57.746
So you've come to me.

01:00:57.746 --> 01:00:59.048
One job.

01:00:59.048 --> 01:01:00.752
We don't care
how long it takes.

01:01:00.752 --> 01:01:03.791
Generous stipend,
rotating diplomatic covers,

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:06.029
sizable bonus upon completion.

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:09.401
Just bring in Sterling Archer.

01:01:09.836 --> 01:01:11.072
I'll think about it.

01:01:11.072 --> 01:01:12.909
We'd expect nothing less,
Ms. Kane.

01:01:17.017 --> 01:01:18.486
Don't worry, Mom.
I got him.

01:01:18.486 --> 01:01:20.959
Very funny, AJ.
How was the zoo?

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:23.330
Mom, it was amazing!
I saw an elephant.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.100
We had cotton candy.
Dad got me a--

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.170
Shh!
Let it be a surprise.

01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:31.079
Uh-oh.
Do you two need... to talk?

01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:33.316
I'll go wait in the car.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.257
Well, you better be able
to live off that stipend,

01:01:37.257 --> 01:01:39.195
because you're never
bringing me in.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.798
Oh, dream on, buddy.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.067
Could be fun, though.

01:01:42.067 --> 01:01:43.470
Cat and mouse for years.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.173
Glimpses in the corridor.

01:01:45.173 --> 01:01:47.077
Imagine
the erotic possibilities.

01:01:47.077 --> 01:01:49.315
- Ugh.
- Then it's settled.

01:01:49.315 --> 01:01:51.119
Visits with AJ are off-limits?

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:53.189
Oh, obviously.

01:01:53.189 --> 01:01:56.262
Here's to a suspense-filled
three days before I catch you.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.237
Well, got to head back
to the shadows.

01:02:01.807 --> 01:02:03.811
It was quite the thing,
wasn't it?

01:02:03.811 --> 01:02:05.046
Right?

01:02:08.954 --> 01:02:11.492
Hey, Lana,
I, um--

01:02:11.492 --> 01:02:14.031
about us...

01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:16.169
I'm really gonna miss
hearing what you--

01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:17.404
what you think about stuff.

01:02:19.174 --> 01:02:21.445
Couldn't have
said that ten years ago?

01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:23.917
Asshole.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.257
- Oh, and, Lana?
- Yeah?

01:02:27.257 --> 01:02:28.961
Like I said, AJ and I
went to the zoo,

01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:32.200
and, uh, you should probably
buy a gibbon cage.

01:02:35.107 --> 01:02:37.311
God damn it.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.532
Lana, I got your message--

01:02:47.532 --> 01:02:49.536
Archer?
What are you doing here?

01:02:49.536 --> 01:02:52.141
And where the hell do you
get off not saying goodbye?

01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:53.410
Well, Pam, I hate goodbyes.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:54.980
And I knew I'd see you again.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.416
So, what,
you pretended to be Lana

01:02:56.416 --> 01:02:58.119
and called me here
to apologize?

01:02:58.119 --> 01:03:01.159
Pfft, no, it's just that I've
been out there on my own

01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:02.862
and it's--it's not sustainable.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.198
No one to watch my back.

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.135
What happened
to thriving solo

01:03:06.135 --> 01:03:08.073
in literally any situation?

01:03:08.073 --> 01:03:09.876
Eh, I might have been wrong.

01:03:09.876 --> 01:03:12.448
You want in? High danger.
Not a lot of money.

01:03:12.448 --> 01:03:15.922
Just get
in the goddamn elevator.

01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:18.059
- So where to?
- Tangier.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:20.932
- What we got there?
- Not a fucking clue.

01:03:20.932 --> 01:03:22.333
Perfect.

01:04:00.544 --> 01:04:03.416
<i>Made in Georgia.</i>
