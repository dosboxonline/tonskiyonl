If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.916
Have you modified your uniform?

17:41.875 --> 17:43.708
Perhaps slightly.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.166
Pockets, piping, and...

17:45.250 --> 17:47.500
and some light tailoring.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.500
I know one of these men. Kravas.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.333
That's another reason I wanted this
to get immediate attention.

17:55.416 --> 17:57.666
He was a squad commander on Four.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.291
He's fallen a great deal since then.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.000
He was a Sentry Corporal here on One.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.208
No mystery there.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.250
He's lucky he wasn't killed years ago.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.708
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.

18:06.791 --> 18:08.666
There's no suspect at this point?

18:08.750 --> 18:10.083
We have some excellent leads.

18:10.166 --> 18:13.500
"A human with dark features
asking about a Kenari girl

18:13.583 --> 18:15.791
"who might have been working
in the establishment."

18:15.875 --> 18:19.333
Are there no witnesses to the actual
crime? It's usually quite busy there.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.958
Apparently not.
This happened just outside the district,

18:22.041 --> 18:24.750
-at the plaza entrance to the causeway.
-I know.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.083
-There's an intersection...
-I said I know it.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.916
-Were they robbed?
-No, sir.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.333
Tough case.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.708
Bad timing.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.166
I'm sure that in several days,
with the proper resources,

18:37.250 --> 18:38.958
-I can bring this case to a...
-Stop!

18:39.458 --> 18:42.541
And I don't mean just the talking.
I mean stop.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.416
This case appears to bear
all the hallmarks

18:47.500 --> 18:50.458
of what I like to describe
as regrettable misadventure.

18:50.875 --> 18:51.875
Sir?

18:51.958 --> 18:54.000
Two dedicated Pre-Mor employees

18:54.083 --> 18:57.000
caught in the sad orbit
of a rare calamity.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.750
I don't understand.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.333
I want you to conjure a suitable accident.

19:01.416 --> 19:02.916
-But...
-And let's make sure

19:03.000 --> 19:06.291
it's on the far side of the plaza.
Let's get it outside the Leisure Zone.

19:06.375 --> 19:07.750
-But they were murdered.
-No.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.583
They were killed in a fight.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.875
They were in a brothel,
which we're not supposed to have,

19:12.958 --> 19:15.375
the expensive one,
which they shouldn't be able to afford,

19:15.458 --> 19:18.208
drinking Revnog,
which we're not supposed to allow.

19:18.291 --> 19:22.625
Both of them supposedly on the job,
which is a dismissible offense.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.416
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features

19:25.500 --> 19:27.458
and chose the wrong person to annoy.

19:29.041 --> 19:33.250
I suspect they died rushing
to aid someone in distress.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.583
Nothing too heroic.
We don't need a parade.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.583
They died being helpful.

19:38.666 --> 19:42.375
Something sad but inspiring
in a mundane sort of way.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.291
You look stricken, Deputy Inspector.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.833
Are you absorbing my meaning here?

19:52.541 --> 19:53.750
Trying, sir.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.375
When I said bad timing,

19:56.458 --> 19:59.916
I wasn't referring to the fact
that you spent all night worrying this.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.916
I meant that
I am on my way this very morning

20:03.000 --> 20:06.166
to an Imperial Regional Command review,

20:06.916 --> 20:10.000
where I'll be asked to make a report
about our crime rates,

20:10.500 --> 20:11.916
and the goal of that speech,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.250
should you ever be asked to deliver it,
is brevity.

20:15.750 --> 20:20.208
Minimizing the time the Empire spends
thinking about Preox-Morlana

20:20.291 --> 20:23.166
benefits our superiors and, by extension,

20:23.250 --> 20:26.875
everyone here
at the Pre-Mor Security Inspection team,

20:26.958 --> 20:30.333
which at the moment includes you.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.916
Don't put your feet on my desk
in my absence,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.916
and let's have an accident report waiting
when I get back.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.583
Yeah, tell him that 15,000
is the best he's gonna get.

How fast can you reach him?

21:34.458 --> 21:35.541
What happened to you?

21:36.166 --> 21:37.166
I fell.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.041
On what? A jealous husband?

21:39.833 --> 21:41.333
I have something to sell.

21:41.416 --> 21:43.125
Don't we all?

21:43.208 --> 21:44.458
How soon could he be here?

21:44.541 --> 21:46.833
I was planning to reach out
at the end of the month.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.625
No. This would have to be now.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.541
Yeah, for what? For one item?

21:52.625 --> 21:55.875
No. That's not how it works.
I bundle things before I make contact.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.750

22:00.625 --> 22:04.125

looking for scrap.

I'm told there's a rack
of Imperial targeting units

22:06.541 --> 22:08.541

22:08.625 --> 22:10.791

22:12.208 --> 22:13.791
-I can't wait that long.
-Why?

22:16.416 --> 22:17.666
What have you done?

22:19.083 --> 22:21.208
Your friend will want this piece.

22:21.291 --> 22:24.041
He'll come for this.
You said he wanted to meet me.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.125
So, what is it?

22:26.416 --> 22:27.583
What is it?

22:29.458 --> 22:32.666
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.

22:32.750 --> 22:36.750
Vector crystals and Imperial seal
still intact.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.208
How long have you had that?

22:39.875 --> 22:40.875
I need to move it, Bix.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.416
-You've been hiding it.
-Saving it.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.375
I'm guessing it comes from one of my bids.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.708
-Guess again.
-Not your best move, Cassian.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.250

22:52.083 --> 22:53.500

-No, no. The answer's no.
-You don't know what I'm about to suggest.

23:14.416 --> 23:16.333
-I'm not selling this to you, Bix.
-Come on.

into something more than work.

about any of this.

No. No, no. That wasn't my question.

There's not a lot about Kenari, sir.
It's fairly obscure.

That should make it easier.

We'll have to put the word out.

-On Ferrix?
-Where else would we put it?

32:21.458 --> 32:23.083
We don't have presence there, sir.

-Is it not under our jurisdiction?
-OFFICER 3: Technically.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.041
We are simply asking for information.

-What difference does that make?

Now? He's in the office.

33:26.541 --> 33:30.416
I refueled it. Just like you told me.
And now I'm almost done.

33:30.916 --> 33:33.833
What is that? Is that the ID chip log?

33:33.916 --> 33:34.916

I didn't like the way
it was running last night.

33:59.708 --> 34:01.208
So you're doing me a favor?

I wouldn't do that if I was you.
