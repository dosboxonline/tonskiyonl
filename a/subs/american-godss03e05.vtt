Ah, this time?

41:22.218 --> 41:24.482
For lack of a better
word, Purgatory.

41:25.439 --> 41:26.353

not praying.

Is the constant atheist worried
that I've lost my faith?

41:54.990 --> 41:57.210
Well, you've just
always been very devout.

If I was truly following
the tenets of Islam,

42:01.301 --> 42:03.564
I couldn't come
on this trip with you.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.958
To be alone with a woman
is forbidden.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.569
Well, I promise
to keep it in my pants.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.529

answer my question.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.535

convince her to leave.

43:18.944 --> 43:20.946
She doesn't want to leave yet.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.601
A touch of the
Stockholm Syndrome.

43:23.905 --> 43:25.211
She simply needs reminding

43:25.341 --> 43:27.953

to offer the world, huh?
