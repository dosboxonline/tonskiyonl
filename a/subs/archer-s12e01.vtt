WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:03.712
[triumphant music playing]

00:03.795 --> 00:05.922
Saviors of the frickin' world.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.007
Whoo!

00:08.758 --> 00:11.803
[applauding, cheering]

00:29.112 --> 00:30.697
And that's what would have happened.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.158
If you had hired CloudBeam Marketing.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.492
-Hi.
-But you didn't.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.536
-So it didn't.
-Which is why you're broke.

00:36.619 --> 00:38.621
-No judgment.
-Really? Because I judge it.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
Said our largest expense.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.542
Hey, alcohol is a group expense.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.837
Seems like we should have cut alcohol
before our health plan.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.382
-Eh, vodka disinfects cuts.
-Well, I miss my dark science budget.

00:49.466 --> 00:53.428
-The hell is dark science?
-It's basically science, but darker.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.139
I'm sad the wall art's gone.
It riled my loins.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.224
What doesn't rile your loins?

00:58.308 --> 01:02.604
Enough! We're not here to waste time
or prison toilet scotch.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.816
We're here because these ranting buffoons
think they can solve our problems.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.152
-One of her better introductions.
-Real talk?

01:09.235 --> 01:12.906
-The espionage climate has changed.
-Your old spy model just doesn't work.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.992
-Hello, dinosaur? Meet asteroid.
-But that's where we come in.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.744
Hello, dinosaur? Meet marketing.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.080
[gasps] Are they turning us
into a dinosaur?

01:20.163 --> 01:22.457
Honestly, I don't know, but I'm loving it.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.794
Simple version, we can synthesize
your messaging to encourage…

01:25.877 --> 01:28.421
[both] Multitier client sourcing.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.049
[gasps] Wow, did that just happen?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.425
-That was the simple version?
-Wait.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.177
Does this mean
we're shooting people again?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.804
Maybe. If we had bullets.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.181
-We sold the bullets?
-Yeah, we're boned.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.599
No, we're not.

01:39.682 --> 01:43.478
Yes, the government denied our heroism
and withheld payment.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.772
And yes, contracts have been drying up,

01:45.855 --> 01:49.567
but I know better things
are right around the--

01:49.651 --> 01:51.653
[lights crackling]

01:51.736 --> 01:53.071
Around the--

01:53.154 --> 01:54.280
[power whirs down]

01:54.364 --> 01:55.573
Damn it!

01:57.117 --> 01:58.785
Around the what?

01:59.869 --> 02:01.037
Ass?

02:40.410 --> 02:43.496
Your entire process is outdated dirt.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.081
But dirt with potential.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.917
-A nutrient-rich loam.
-Is there life on Mars?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.044
-[both] Definitely.
-Oh-ho, man.

02:50.128 --> 02:54.674
You keep doing this fun marketing banter
and I'm gonna need to sit on a sandbag.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.969
You need to get out of the dark ages
of the espionage industry.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.346
I mean, do you even use Global Spy Wire?

03:01.848 --> 03:05.059
Exactly how many beats of silence
are you shooting for?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.895
You're not on GSW?

03:06.978 --> 03:10.398
It's only the online marketplace
for spy jobs.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.774
Like the classifieds?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.943
-[both laughing]
-Extra! Extra!

03:14.027 --> 03:16.404
Spymaster uses outdated media!

03:16.487 --> 03:19.574
Aw, geez, don't raise
the prices, Mr. Pulitzer.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.742
[both] Newsies!

03:20.825 --> 03:23.202
My God, this is what it's come to.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.246
Hocking my paintings for rent money

03:25.330 --> 03:29.083
and taking business advice
from theater school flunkies.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.003
-I was economics.
-Folklore and mythology.

03:32.086 --> 03:35.381
Why would we use want ads?
Our phone is ringing off the hook.

03:35.465 --> 03:39.093
Well, actually,
it has been pretty quiet lately.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.512
Okay, real talk? The phone is broken.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.599
-Since when?
-A few months ago. I don't know.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.935
I'd call someone to fix it, but, you know.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.271
-This is why you need CloudBeam.
-To buy us a new phone?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.440
To help you, the little guy,

03:52.523 --> 03:55.443
compete with the big
spy conglomerates like IIA.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.819
IIA. [scoffs]

03:56.903 --> 03:59.489
Soulless vultures. Nice uniforms, though.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.908
I heard they bought ODIN, fired everyone,

04:01.991 --> 04:04.911
then made them reapply
for their own jobs at half pay.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.995
That's bullshit.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.624
You can't just fire someone for no reason.
It would've happened to me by now.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.960
What's next? You fire someone
for breaking a phone

04:12.043 --> 04:14.003
when she was smashing a ladybug
over and over?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.422
Uh, okay, look.
Maybe these guys have a point.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.924
About us being dirt?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.801
About us needing help to compete.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.428
My reputation as the world's greatest spy
only goes so far.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.348
Especially since that's
a pre-coma reputation.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.475
-Said pre-nut-tap Cyril.
-What?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.559
[groans]

04:28.643 --> 04:32.063
Ugh, sorry I'm late. Robert and I
got into another huge fight about--

04:32.146 --> 04:34.732
-About whether or not we'd care?
-Ugh, actually, sort of.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.984
It all started when--

04:36.067 --> 04:39.028
Wanted ads? Is that all you've got?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.738
[laughs] Hardly.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.117
You also need a strong brand,
and that starts with a good name.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.246
Think of something people already love.
Then spice it up with a spy angle.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.831
Ooh! Anal Bullets!

04:49.914 --> 04:52.917
And that feels like a good place to stop.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.088
Thank you for your interest,
but we simply don't need CloudBeam.

04:57.171 --> 05:01.092
Fair enough, but I have a feeling
we'll be hearing from you soon.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.220
Yeah, hearing you scream our names
from the rooftops.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.308
[both] "Kaya, Alton, save us! Save us!"

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
[laughing]

05:10.435 --> 05:13.771
Anybody else got an eerie feeling
they might be right?

05:13.855 --> 05:17.525
Nonsense, there's nothing they said
that we can't do ourselves.

05:17.608 --> 05:21.070
Pam, Cheryl, you two
are our new marketing team.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.197
-Brand us.
-[gasps] I'll get my tools.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.199
I think she means with a name, cowboy.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.367
We'll give her options.

05:26.451 --> 05:30.371
As for new jobs,
we'll start with small missions on GSW,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.749
get a good rating, and slowly--

05:32.832 --> 05:36.502
Sign up for the most lucrative job
on Global Spy Wire, boom.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.254
"Rival bounty situation.

05:38.337 --> 05:41.049
Cash on delivery of the package.
Multiple bidders."

05:41.132 --> 05:43.968
-Wha-- No money up front?
-But big money in back.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.721
We'll be drinking non-swill
from non-plastic in no time.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.805
Idiot!

05:47.889 --> 05:50.767
Do you realize how competitive
this contract will be?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.435
Now that I'm involved? Very.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.605
We can't afford this mission.
We can barely afford the flight.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.357
And your testicles can't afford
another cane tap.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.859
-[gasps]
-Ugh, let's do it.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.153
After the morning I've had
with Robert, I'd go anywhere.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.654
Preferably somewhere with--

06:03.738 --> 06:07.116
-[Archer] A giant heap of rat shit.
-Seriously, Cyril?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.827
Oh, wait, there's also
a pile of rat shit under here,

06:09.911 --> 06:12.663
which means we're looking at
a men's room/women's room situation.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.750
This was the nicest place we could afford.
I'm trying to save our funds.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.669
Not an issue because
I spent all the funds on Trânta.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.880
-Who the hell is Trânta?
-You mean, what is Trânta.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.424
It's Moldovan folk wrestling,
and it's fantastic.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.677
You lost all our money gambling
on regional martial arts?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.180
No, my guys won,
but then I had to buy drinks.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.474
It'll be fine.
Here are the briefing papers.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.769
-Double-sided? How poor are we?
-You just spent all of our money.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.188
Yeah, on memories
that will last a lifetime.

06:37.271 --> 06:41.067
Two days ago, mercenaries kidnapped
this man, known as The Professor.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.820
And that thing is a prototype
for an ionic fusion device.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.696
Ionic fusion device? What is that?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.241
An expensive MacGuffin
in a life full of them.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.076
According to our sources,

06:50.159 --> 06:53.496
he's being moved out of the country
in a few hours on this highway.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.791
We worked all of our contacts
to get this tip, so our only advantage

06:56.874 --> 07:00.002
is this one piece of information
that none of the big agencies have.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.089
Greetings, and welcome to Moldova.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.632
Finally, the concierge.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.717
We'd like a free bottle of scotch
and directions

07:06.801 --> 07:08.845
to a hall of Trânta
that takes bets on credit.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.139
And a room with less rat feces?

07:11.222 --> 07:14.767
Forgive me for intruding.
My name is Fabian Kingsworth.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.644
I am head of IIA.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.813
Well, well, well. The competition.

07:18.896 --> 07:23.317
[laughs] I guess your tiny agency
is competition for IIA

07:23.401 --> 07:25.820
the way coffee is competition for cocaine.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.280
Yeah, I mean, sure.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.740
I mean, What do you want?
We're sort of mid-mission here.

07:29.824 --> 07:33.953
I just wanted to stop by to get a chance
to meet the Sterling Archer.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.414
I was delighted to learn
you were not dead,

07:36.497 --> 07:39.375
but, rather, alive as a mere shadow
of your former self.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.670
Well, looks like you're chasing shadows,
since we got here first.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.505
First? [laughs]

07:44.589 --> 07:47.091
We set up our command center weeks ago.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.760
And of course, our satellites
are always overhead.

07:49.844 --> 07:53.389
Which works slightly better
than a guy on a roof with binoculars.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.266
Oh, yeah? Well, we have--

07:55.349 --> 07:56.476
A guy on a roof?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.145
No. Something way better than that.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.773
-Cold-ass pouring rain.
-[thunder booming]

08:02.857 --> 08:04.692
Cheap-ass binoculars.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.361
That.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.490
[laughs] I'm rooting for you, Archer.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
Like when you see a beetle on its back,

08:12.658 --> 08:14.368
legs kicking and flailing,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.329
not knowing that he's already dead

08:16.412 --> 08:20.041
as the shadow of a giant,
elegant bird falls over him.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.959
I am that bird.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.795
At which point,
the beetle hops up and eats the bird!

08:24.879 --> 08:26.214
-[bone crunches]
-Ah!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
[sighs] Why build on <i>his</i> metaphor?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.052
And what beetle eats birds?

08:31.135 --> 08:33.471
Jesus, your forearms
are like bowling pins.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.847
Yes, well, uh… [clears throat]

08:34.931 --> 08:36.140
I should get going.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.600
I'm sorry. [sniffles]

08:37.683 --> 08:41.229
It's emotional meeting someone
I used to look up to.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.107
There is no way
we're losing to that asshole.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.027
Starting now, we stay one,
no, make it two steps ahead of him.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.404
-Cyril, note that.
-I'm not mission secretary.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.489
Then what are you?

08:51.572 --> 08:54.325
Hey, Two Step,
Fabian planted a bug on your shoulder.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.535
Damn it!

08:55.618 --> 08:56.619
Oh!

08:57.119 --> 08:59.539
Why won't this break when you--

08:59.622 --> 09:01.958
-Just gonna save us some time.
-Okay, new plan.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.586
We follow Kingsworth and sabotage him
and his team in a super humiliating way.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.922
Archer, we are not risking
this mission and our lives

09:08.005 --> 09:09.924
so you can beat
a better version of yourself.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.093
He is not better.
He said he looked up to me.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.679
-Actually, he said he used to.
-I know what he said!

09:14.762 --> 09:18.099
-[Ray] Y'all, I just saw a caravan of--
-[both] IIA vehicles. We know.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.769
Well, nice to know my pneumonia
and near-electrocution was worth it.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.564
Shut up. Here's the plan.
Ray, find their command center.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.401
Way ahead of you. They got a jillion cars
over at the Moldovan Bloom Hotel.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.486
Okay, Lana and I will follow IIA.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.823
You two stay back here and pretend
I'm still with you so the bug hears it.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.700
And just how are we gonna do that?

09:35.783 --> 09:37.827
Just pretend we're talking
and do an impression of me.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.453
What, like, "My name's Archer.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.914
I'm an egomaniac
who endangers every mission

09:41.998 --> 09:43.833
with my self-serving narcissism.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.877
Also, I'm inebriated
almost 24 hours a day."

09:46.961 --> 09:51.007
Ha! That was pretty good, actually.
Lose the "almost" and then take it again.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.014
All right. We can do this.
We're just as good as CloudBeam.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.224
So espionage names, espionage names.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.767
Oh, I got it.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.686
S.P. Nosh.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.440
Sure, if you're planning on opening
a spy-themed delicatessen.

10:07.523 --> 10:11.402
Hmm. What would Kaya and Alton do?

10:12.236 --> 10:13.988
"Hey, everything here is old as dirt!"

10:14.071 --> 10:15.990
-"Dirt with potential!"
-"Edible dirt!"

10:16.073 --> 10:17.783
"Loud words and fake laughter!"

10:17.867 --> 10:21.078
[both cackling]

10:21.162 --> 10:23.080
So break for lunch?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.960
[Lana] Ugh, I can't believe
I'm asking you this.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.379
Oh, God. Look, Lana, I'm flattered.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
-So just make it quick.
-[zipper unzips]

10:31.964 --> 10:33.633
What? I am not asking to blow you.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.719
-Then open with that.
-God, this is already hard enough.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.929
-Phrasing.
-Ugh. Forget it.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.431
No, sorry, go ahead.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.725
You can't believe
you're asking this, but--

10:42.808 --> 10:43.809
But… [sighs]

10:43.893 --> 10:45.978
When you live with someone who annoys you,

10:46.062 --> 10:47.980
how do you address it
without causing conflict?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.566
Hmm. Have you tried making them
eat a bowl of spiderwebs?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.610
-[phone buzzing]
-What do you want, Pam?

10:52.693 --> 10:55.696
No, there's already a company
called Spies With Thighs.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.698
They're PIs. They're good guys.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.493
How may I help you?

11:00.576 --> 11:02.286
[in aristocratic accent]
Yes, my name is Chet Manley,

11:02.370 --> 11:04.205
and my wife Betty, right here,

11:04.288 --> 11:06.749
just found a severed thumb in our bidet.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.544
-Can we please see a manager?
-Oh, my! Yes, just one moment.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.632
[normal voice] There, a block of suites
for IIA, 20th floor.

11:15.966 --> 11:16.967
[Lana clears throat]

11:17.051 --> 11:19.428
What? I want to talk to the manager
about that thumb.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.597
Might get a free drink ticket out of it.

11:22.723 --> 11:26.685
Our target will cross Route 90
at 1400 hours.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.270
Per usual, if you're late,

11:28.354 --> 11:30.981
the minutes will be taken
out of your paid family leave time.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.066
[all groan]

11:32.149 --> 11:35.319
And a reminder,
bullet rationing is still in effect.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.114
That's five dollars per bullet
that misses the target.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.448
I'm looking at you, Andy.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.034
Bullet penalties? Ha! Suckers.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.036
Well, at least they can afford bullets.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.456
[speaking Moldovan]

11:47.540 --> 11:51.460
[speaking Moldovan, laughs]

11:51.544 --> 11:54.630
Once en route,
there's no exit for 80 kilometers.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.465
All right? We head out in ten.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.134
Ten? We gotta go if we're gonna--

11:58.217 --> 12:00.970
Do the insanely stupid thing
of sabotaging IIA

12:01.053 --> 12:02.638
instead of just beating them to the punch?

12:02.721 --> 12:05.766
You know what else seemed insanely stupid?
Betting on folk wrestling.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.227
-Sure was.
-But I had a great time, Lana.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.520
Congrats on the wedding.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.356
Hope it works out better for you
than it did for Lana here.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.652
Whoa, Boërl &amp; Kroff?
Now I see why you couldn't afford a suite.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.991
[Ray on speaker] <i>Well, Archer,</i>
<i>you're in charge. What's our next move?</i>

12:22.074 --> 12:23.534
[Cyril] <i>The plan is, we stay here</i>

12:23.617 --> 12:25.911
and wait for instructions, dipshit.

12:26.745 --> 12:31.041
[clears throat] Uh, hey, guys.
Should we order some room service?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.879
[in deep voice] Uh, God forbid you skip
a meal and your breasts shrink to a B-cup.

12:34.962 --> 12:35.963
[snickers]

12:39.675 --> 12:43.471
God, sometimes I think my entire life
is just sneaking around.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.807
Do you ever wonder if you, ugh,
I don't know, made the wrong choice?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.935
Like how I should've brought Ray with me
instead of you? Constantly.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.355
-I mean in a relationship.
-I wouldn't call this a relationship.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.316
Not with you! With Robert.

12:55.399 --> 12:59.528
-Oh. Yeah. That seems terrible.
-But is it? I mean, I do love him.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.072
But other times, I'm just like, ugh.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.116
Yeah, like during old man sex?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.411
-How's it work if you both just lie there?
-Shh. Guards.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.914
No, employees.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.666
Hey, dickheads,
I'm gonna steal that Humvee.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.751
You better shoot me.

13:16.086 --> 13:20.090
Oof, 20 bullets and none in my body?
What is that, 100 bucks?

13:24.762 --> 13:26.222
[laughs] 200 bucks.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.015
You're basically working for free-- Ah!

13:28.098 --> 13:30.100
[coughs] Okay, 195.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.106
[air hissing]

13:36.190 --> 13:39.109
Okay, we'll disable their vehicles,
then go pick up the others.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.528
With our new helicopter.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.740
Archer, you can't fly a helicopter.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.493
Being in a coma didn't make me
less of a helicopter pilot, Lana.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.704
-You never knew how to fly a helicopter!
-Well, then we're both right.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.206
I'm not getting in that.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.625
Great. Grab us a Humvee
and I'll race you to the hotel.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.709
Whoo-hoo!

13:56.502 --> 13:57.878
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.130
[laughs] Whoo-hoo!

14:00.214 --> 14:02.550
Sorry. Not a political statement.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.385
Just an accident.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.470
[in deep voice]
Well, maybe you'd have a better job…

14:06.554 --> 14:09.390
[normal voice] if you didn't have
such a debilitating confidence issue!

14:09.473 --> 14:11.475
And what about you, Ray, you dipshit?

14:11.559 --> 14:12.977
You live in a studio apartment

14:13.060 --> 14:16.605
filled with mid-century
craftsman doghouses and no dog.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.567
A, they're Queen Annes,
B, dogs would ruin them,

14:19.650 --> 14:21.819
and C, I'll kill you!

14:25.948 --> 14:27.533
What the hell is this?

14:27.616 --> 14:28.868
A helicopter?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.453
-Get in!
-Yeah, I'm good on the ground.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.582
That's an option?
I'm also good on the ground.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.001
[Archer] Helicopter!

14:39.795 --> 14:42.047
IIA has armored Humvees?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.466
Ooh. Ooh!

14:44.550 --> 14:46.135
Yep. Butt warmers.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.554
[both] We should look into IIA.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.891
[crow caws]

14:52.600 --> 14:55.019
That's it, Sheila. Nice and easy.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.105
-You named the helicopter Sheila?
-No, the stick is Sheila.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.525
The helicopter
is Dr. Whirlington Spinblade.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.987
Okay, I have a visual on the target.
Semitruck, dead ahead.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.656
You see that, Lana?
Step one, take out IIA.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.826
Step two, get the scientist.
Step three, profit.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.037
And a haircut. It's been, like, two weeks.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.414
[Lana] <i>Congrats.</i>
<i>You accidentally didn't fail.</i>

15:15.497 --> 15:17.374
And got a free helicopter.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.961
Um, how sure are you
that you finished step one?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.012
Pretty sure.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.097
-[yelps]
-[gunfire]

15:37.019 --> 15:39.980
[Pam] So let's say you're some rich,
fancy-pants company

15:40.064 --> 15:42.024
who needs some professional spy shit done.

15:42.107 --> 15:46.779
Do you want the cold, hard-tile feel
of a big conglomerate like IIA?

15:46.862 --> 15:49.573
[laughs] I'd rather kill myself
and take you with me.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.494
Or do you want a boutique agency
that offers a warm, personal touch?

15:53.577 --> 15:56.789
Like a stranger's hand on your side butt
in an airport shuttle.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.749
When you need spies, you need…

15:58.832 --> 16:00.501
[both] Slugs-N-Jugs!

16:00.584 --> 16:01.710
Pew, pew, pew!

16:02.753 --> 16:03.754
[sighs]

16:04.421 --> 16:07.800
I told you we should've gone with
The Back and Spyin' Center.

16:07.883 --> 16:11.971
That's why I think our company
would make a great investment for--

16:12.054 --> 16:14.890
You can't do this to me, Maurice.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.476
You just can't. I-- I--

16:17.559 --> 16:18.727
-Hello?
-[line beeps]

16:18.811 --> 16:19.937
Damn it!

16:20.896 --> 16:22.773
Think, Malory. Think.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.651
No, not that. Think harder.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.320
[sighs] Fine.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.408
-[beeps]
-[line ringing]

16:36.495 --> 16:38.747
Can you not? I'm still learning here.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.796
[Ray] Dukes!

16:47.423 --> 16:50.718
-Butt warmers and bulletproof windows?
-I mean--

16:52.136 --> 16:54.805
[Archer] Jesus, they sprung for tracers?
That's good prep.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.974
I almost feel bad about
my inevitable triumph.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.018
Triumph? I've been shot twice.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.769
[Lana] <i>Archer,</i>
<i>you wanna help me down here,</i>

17:00.853 --> 17:03.063
<i>or are you just gonna watch me</i>
<i>get rammed from behind?</i>

17:03.147 --> 17:04.982
-That was intentional, right?
-<i>Archer!</i>

17:05.065 --> 17:06.066
I'm coming.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.652
Also intentional.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.571
[phone buzzing]

17:10.654 --> 17:11.947
-What?
-[Pam] <i>Hey, Lana.</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:13.991
<i>What about "Spies and Dolls"?</i>

17:14.074 --> 17:15.701
Well, what does the doll part mean?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.996
[Cheryl] <i>Maybe we leave behind</i>
<i>a creepy doll on every mission.</i>

17:19.079 --> 17:20.622
[Pam] <i>You know what? We'll call you back.</i>

17:20.706 --> 17:23.709
-[Cyril] What are you doing?
-[Archer] What does it look like, Cyril?

17:23.792 --> 17:26.628
I'm using the helicopter blades
to slice open the top of the truck.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.630
Helicopter!

17:30.215 --> 17:33.385
Uh-oh, apparently helicopters
don't like it when you do that.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.804
Keep it together, Dr. Spinblade.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.514
Uh, damn it, I'm stuck.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.558
I'm not leaving without you, Cyril.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.978
I need something soft to land on.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.688
[both shout]

17:46.607 --> 17:48.776
Ah, goddamn it, Cyril.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.361
What good
is your pillowy beef suit of a torso

17:51.445 --> 17:53.530
if you don't position yourself under me?

17:55.783 --> 17:59.495
Hey, I see that scientist guy
down there with the thingy, and three--

17:59.578 --> 18:01.663
Check that, one alive kidnapper.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.293
Damn it, I'm out. Oh, wait, no, I'm not.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.670
Man, IIA's got good taste in guns.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.173
-[Fabian] <i>You got that right.</i>
-What? Who the hell is that?

18:11.256 --> 18:14.593
<i>The guy who wants to offer you</i>
<i>a way out of your terrible job.</i>

18:14.676 --> 18:18.180
-How'd you get in my earpiece?
-<i>Do you guys seriously not have satellite?</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:19.306
[Ray] Satellite?

18:19.389 --> 18:22.142
<i>The microwave in our break room</i>
<i>has a rotary dial.</i>

18:22.226 --> 18:25.187
Silly rabbit. Warlock Six, engage!

18:28.857 --> 18:31.360
Jesus! Ray, shoot out the tires.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.074
[phone buzzing]

18:37.157 --> 18:40.244
Goddamn it, Pam.
Hey, shit-for-brains, I'm busy.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.703
Leave me the hell alone.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.541
I just--

18:46.041 --> 18:47.042
I love you too.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.379
[grunts] Krieger, you idiot.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.423
Why didn't you build a cane
with the Jaws of Life?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.010
-Ha! Look at that.
-[electronic whirring]

18:57.094 --> 18:58.887
Cyril, climb into the cab of the truck,

18:58.971 --> 19:00.806
overtake the driver,
and get behind the wheel.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.559
Are you kidding me?
How the hell do you want me to do that?

19:03.642 --> 19:05.978
Squeeze your fat ass
into the cab of that truck

19:06.061 --> 19:07.938
like there's a free box
of Twinkies in there.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.524
[grunts]

19:10.607 --> 19:12.526
Not so fast, punk.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.445
Oh, shit. Oh, God.
Hang on, I thought I turned these off.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.613
-[agent groaning]
-[gasps]

19:16.697 --> 19:17.948
-Sorry.
-Please don't hurt me.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.533
Hurt you? I'm here to rescue you.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.703
-[agent sobs]
-Uh, ignore that ripped-apart guy.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.459
I'm in! We did it! We won!

19:29.543 --> 19:34.047
Um, Lana, looks like we're coming up
on a checkpoint with a blockade.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.340
Know anything about that?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.509
That is the border
of Moldova and Transnistria.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.969
Did you not read the briefing?

19:39.052 --> 19:41.096
[Archer] <i>Who reads the back</i>
<i>of a two-sided briefing?</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:42.931
<i>What the hell is Transnistria, Lana?</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:45.809
It's a tiny breakaway country from Moldova

19:45.893 --> 19:48.187
that is literally one side of the river.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.521
Lovely people.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.441
Here's a fun twist. My brakes don't work.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.611
That was me.
I scrambled the electronic braking system.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.905
I'll just grab the prototype
and skedaddle.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.364
[shouts]

19:59.448 --> 20:02.284
Oh, I say. Poor Archer.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.744
So diminished.

20:03.827 --> 20:07.080
He wouldn't make it through
the first round of screening at IIA.

20:07.164 --> 20:12.002
Don't try to convince me to join IIA
by playing mind games, Fabian.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.087
You? Join the IIA?

20:14.171 --> 20:16.757
At what feels like a quarter
of your former strength?

20:16.840 --> 20:20.260
-How's this for a quarter strength?
-Yes, with the cane.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.511
But without it--

20:21.595 --> 20:22.846
Huh? Oh.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.517
-[groans]
-[glass breaks]

20:27.601 --> 20:32.648
Looks like I'll be taking this after all.
Good effort, Archer.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.650
Fabian!

20:34.733 --> 20:37.027
Goddamn it, he's getting
away with the prototype.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.572
Shit. We've got bigger problems, Lana.
He broke my cane.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.574
And I was still learning
about its new features.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.201
[Cyril] <i>Um, guys?</i> [laughs]

20:44.284 --> 20:46.995
<i>-Still no brakes up here.</i>
-If I may interject--

20:47.079 --> 20:49.706
[Lana] <i>God, you just had to prove</i>
<i>that you were better than Fabian,</i>

20:49.790 --> 20:51.541
<i>which you obviously are not.</i>

20:51.625 --> 20:53.418
-It's not obvious to me.
-[Cyril] <i>Guys?</i>

20:53.502 --> 20:55.337
If I may. That prototype is useless

20:55.420 --> 20:57.798
without the uranium glass gamma lens
I have in my pocket.

20:57.881 --> 21:01.301
Plus, all the necessary
information is in my brain.

21:01.385 --> 21:05.013
Ah! Hear that, Lana? See?
There is one piece of good news in all--

21:05.097 --> 21:07.724
-Jesus Christ, Cyril, look out!
-[horn blaring]

21:07.808 --> 21:09.768
-[tires squeal]
-[glass shatters]

21:11.478 --> 21:13.814
[monitor beeping]

21:17.567 --> 21:20.237
He needed me, and I let him down.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.239
He's strong. He'll make it.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.243
Oh, boy. Not this coma shit again.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.871
Yeah, comas aren't as entertaining
to watch as I hoped.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.333
Hey, you guys ever do this to me? [laughs]

21:33.417 --> 21:34.626
-Oh, God.
-Better believe it.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.253
-[sustained beep]
-[all gasp]

21:36.336 --> 21:38.964
Ooh! Sorry, Ms. Archer sold
my good life-support device.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.217
This one's made out of a washing machine
and a leaf blower.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.345
[phone rings]

21:46.096 --> 21:50.934
-Good morning, this is… the agency.
-Good enough.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.644
-Don't hate it.
-[man] <i>This is the client.</i>

21:52.728 --> 21:54.938
<i>I need the scientist.</i>
<i>I'll give you a million.</i>

21:55.022 --> 21:58.608
Well, he is in a tiny, little coma.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.235
<i>Make that 200,000.</i>

22:00.319 --> 22:05.157
Or we defer payment until he wakes up,
and at that time,

22:05.240 --> 22:08.869
we'll require the entire reward,
plus his medical expenses,

22:08.952 --> 22:14.082
10% for our troubles,
and a five-star review on GSW.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.376
-Deal?
-<i>Uh, deal.</i>

22:17.169 --> 22:19.004
Uh, aren't we still super poor?

22:19.087 --> 22:22.257
As it happens, the agency's purse strings
have loosened up a bit.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.844
I was able to find us a new financier.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.638
But no more unnecessary expenses.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.017
Wait. Uh, is that a new crystal tumbler?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.728
You're damn right.
