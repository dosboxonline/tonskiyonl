10:43.860 --> 10:45.601
- So do you.
- Why didn't you call me?

10:45.819 --> 10:48.169
- I'm busy.
- Oh, she's busy.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.519
[laughs] Oh, my God.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.304
Oh, my God, the stories I can
tell you about her.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.958
You really know your way
around here, huh?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.699
Well, come here often enough,

10:56.873 --> 10:58.266
you get to know a few people.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.616
Oh, I can see that.

11:00.790 --> 11:01.922
Maybe loosen up a little,
Donnie,

11:02.096 --> 11:04.489
you look like a security guard.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.014
My God, those summers
were the worst.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.016
I mean, I would spend
the whole time

11:09.190 --> 11:11.018
counting the planes taking off
from Idlewild.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.020
I was like that the whole time.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.588
He used to make me pick
the nails off the floor

11:16.763 --> 11:18.808
to save money.
- He still does that, Freddy.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.941
Even now.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.638
He would say to me,
"You keep an eye,

11:22.812 --> 11:24.466
anybody who takes too long
on their smoke break,

11:24.640 --> 11:25.597
you tell me about it."

11:25.772 --> 11:27.121
And he would give me a quarter

11:27.295 --> 11:29.427
for every...
every guy that I tattled on.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.474
It was me against them.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.871
Well, you probably got rich, huh?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.786
Probably got rich those summers.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.050
I want you to be happy.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.094
Let me get another drink.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.139
No, no, come on, come on.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.357
We're alright, thank you,

11:46.531 --> 11:47.445
thank you very much.
- Okay,

11:47.619 --> 11:48.969
I don't need my little brother.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.361
You think I don't have money?
I got money.

11:50.535 --> 11:51.885
I know you do,
but it's my treat, okay?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.148
Take your hat.
You're gonna need this.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.911
And this whole side
all the way down,

12:18.085 --> 12:19.739
I want it cladded in mirrored
glass, okay?

12:19.913 --> 12:21.697
So, when you're across
42nd Street

12:21.871 --> 12:23.525
or you're coming up
the Park Avenue ramp

12:23.699 --> 12:25.266
and you look up, you're gonna
see the Chrysler Building,

12:25.440 --> 12:26.267
the Grand Central Station,

12:26.441 --> 12:27.572
all the landmarks

12:27.747 --> 12:29.226
reflected in that glass.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.401
It's gonna change the whole
ambience

12:30.575 --> 12:31.489
of the neighbourhood.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.664
It's gonna be a beautiful thing.

12:32.839 --> 12:33.753
What do you think?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.232
Yeah.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.407
We're done.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.453
We're done? Vic?

12:38.888 --> 12:40.368
What, what, what are you saying?

12:40.542 --> 12:41.935
If you were serious,
I'd be talking

12:42.109 --> 12:43.414
to your father, not you.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.503
Who the hell wants to build
a luxury hotel

12:45.677 --> 12:46.635
on 42nd Street?

12:46.809 --> 12:47.723
I do, okay?

12:47.897 --> 12:49.116
I will eat, breathe, and sleep,

12:49.290 --> 12:51.161
and shit this job
until it's done.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.121
This is 1,600 rooms right
next to Grand Central.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.905
Hey, how you doing?
You wanna have some fun?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.602
This is my wife here,
you wanna fuck my wife?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.126
- Uh, no, I'm fine, thank you.
- Her tight ass pussy's

12:59.300 --> 13:00.431

13:00.605 --> 13:01.563
I'm alright, thank you.

13:01.737 --> 13:02.956
You saying my wife ain't hot?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.566
Hey, guy, guy, come on.
No loitering.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.350
New York is the greatest city
in the world,

13:06.524 --> 13:07.874
and when it comes back,
and it will big time,

13:08.048 --> 13:09.701
there's gonna be one hell of
a lot of money.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.182
People are gonna get rich,
Vic, like you wouldn't believe.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.534
Come on, Vic, think outside
the box, alright?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.363
I can't deal with you until you
get the feds off your back.

Donald Trump from
the other night, remember?

14:00.491 --> 14:01.275
Right, of course.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.103
Mr Cohn, great suit.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.713
Uh, Donald Trump,
I met you the other night.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.497
Uh, Russ, could you
get my table, please?

14:06.671 --> 14:07.629
Uh, listen, about the lawsuit,

14:07.803 --> 14:09.196
I wanted to talk to you about...

14:09.370 --> 14:10.675
uh, you know,
from before, with my father.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.808
Look, uh, I'm here to have fun,
okay, kid?

14:12.982 --> 14:14.375
Don't ruin my night.

Mr Cohn, Sir,
you have to represent us.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.782
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.002
Well, I'm sorry to follow you to
the bathroom,

14:33.176 --> 14:35.657
but you, you, you, you have to
represent us.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.877
The DOJ is trying to ruin
our lives.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.835
It's, it's, it's a disgrace,
it's an injustice.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.010
I'm trying to take a leak.

14:41.184 --> 14:41.968
They're gonna force us to rent

14:42.142 --> 14:43.404
to welfare cases and,

14:43.578 --> 14:44.535
and they're gonna ruin
the buildings.

14:44.709 --> 14:45.841
Please, I'm begging you, Sir.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.451
I'm, I'm standing in
a bathroom here

14:54.850 --> 14:56.721

and the balls

Well, uh...

15:11.649 --> 15:13.129
I never liked bullies.

15:14.217 --> 15:18.091
The liberals hate capitalism
and, uh, strength

us stand for,

and the American way.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.706
Okay, what they wanna do is

15:24.880 --> 15:27.578
they wanna take money from,
uh, you and me

15:27.752 --> 15:31.408
and, uh, spread it around to,
uh, deadbeats on welfare.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.844
- Uh...
- I'm fine, thank you.

I, I, I don't do that.

That's bad, he's a...
he's a boy scout.

That's bad?

16:10.534 --> 16:12.101
It's not good.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.842
You know what, Donald,
this whole civil rights deal,

16:14.016 --> 16:16.279
it stinks,
the way herring stinks.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.369
You tell me, how many,
uh, stuffed shirt leftists

16:19.543 --> 16:21.589
want their little Johnnies

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286

about that, or...?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.012
Due diligence?
Uh, what's to know?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.797
She's a communist cunt.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.365
[men laughing]
Tell Rupert that she's a robber

19:52.539 --> 19:54.236
baron's wet dream.
Thank you, Rosario.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.585
LAWYER: And ripe
for the picking.

19:55.759 --> 19:56.847
ROY: Phelps divorce.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.588
When is that?
- A week Monday.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.025
Because I wanna be armed to
the goddamn teeth

20:01.200 --> 20:03.245
when I put her yutz of
a husband on the stand.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.291
Morning, sweetheart.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.683
LAWYER: We also have
to deal with

20:06.857 --> 20:07.989
the latest subpoena
from the IRS.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.947
Those geniuses at the IRS.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.645
I mean, it's a total vendetta.
- Fucking IRS.

20:11.819 --> 20:12.776
[dog barking]

20:12.950 --> 20:14.474
Charlie, come here, you schmuck.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.824
- Who let the mutt in here?
- That's Charlie Brown.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.434
Give him a... give him a kiss,
Charlie.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.044
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

20:20.393 --> 20:22.917
Nice. Be careful, uh, he might
try and blow you.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.224
91.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.574
92.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.403
Uh, well, that's the lawsuit,

20:30.577 --> 20:32.361
in case you wanna take a look.
- 94.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.710
All about the Fair Housing
Act...

20:33.884 --> 20:35.059
I'm... I'm doing my sit-ups,
Donald,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.147
hang on.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.453
95.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.239
96.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.633
Don't touch them, please.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.027
Oh, I'm sorry.
- 98...

20:48.551 --> 20:49.465
- 199...
- Wow.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.945
Got quite a collection, Roy.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.164
[grunts] 200.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.992
DONALD: President Nixon,
that's pretty incredible.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.124
Nixon? Yeah, he's a good friend.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.604
He's a close personal friend.

20:57.778 --> 20:58.953
Did you wanna read the...
uh, lawsuit?

20:59.127 --> 21:00.084
I don't need to read
the lawsuit.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.782
I told you, it stinks.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.264
Smells like, uh, my armpit
smells right now.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.091
Yeah. I mean, in reality,
I mean,

21:07.875 --> 21:09.659
I mean, we do rent
to black people.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.226
- You do?
- Yeah, 10 percent

21:11.400 --> 21:13.489
of our buildings go to black
people.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.274
It's just... it's just they have
to make

21:15.448 --> 21:17.188
four times the amount of
the rent

21:17.363 --> 21:18.581
in... in terms of the income

21:18.755 --> 21:20.017
to, to be approved.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.367
Sounds to me like they're
discriminating

21:21.541 --> 21:23.325
against you.
- That's right, they are.

21:23.499 --> 21:26.459
And, uh, it should be called
the Unfair Housing Act.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.505
It's your building, uh, you can
do whatever the hell you want.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.942
Sure sounds nice when you
say it, Roy, you know.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.030
Where's my cheque?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.902
Oh, I got it right here.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.690
Okay, uh, we're in business.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.997
You got a great name. Trump.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.130
Well, may end up on that wall
one day.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.611
- You could be on that wall.
- It'd be nice.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.091
Yeah, you could be on
that wall, why not?

21:50.918 --> 21:52.311
How do you mix with all those
people?

21:52.485 --> 21:54.574
Everybody wants to suck
a winner's cock

21:54.748 --> 21:56.271
is what it comes down to.
[dramatic music]

21:56.576 --> 21:59.796
I've been indicted three times,
I won 36-0.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.842
Government 0, Roy Cohn 36.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.713
- I'm a winner.
- How do you win?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.280
You wanna know how to win?

22:05.715 --> 22:07.587
I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.110
There's rules.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.460
Roy Cohn's three rules of
winning.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.812
The first rule is the simplest,

22:15.986 --> 22:17.945
attack, attack, attack.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.512
[telephone ringing]

22:20.817 --> 22:22.645
Civil Rights, Katz.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.821
ROY: <i>I hope the putz you're
schtupping's got real money,</i>

22:24.995 --> 22:26.997
<i>because, uh, after
I get you fired,</i>

22:27.171 --> 22:28.434
<i>you're sure gonna need it.</i>

22:28.608 --> 22:29.913
Excuse me?

22:30.087 --> 22:32.220
Unless you drop
your baseless litigation,

22:32.394 --> 22:35.919
I am countersuing the Justice
Department for $100 million,

22:36.093 --> 22:38.226
<i>and you are gonna rue the day
that you ever filed this suit.</i>

22:38.400 --> 22:39.314
Who is this?

22:39.488 --> 22:40.446
It's Roy Cohn, calling on behalf

22:40.620 --> 22:42.578
of my client, Donald J. Trump.

22:42.970 --> 22:43.927
[telephone slams]

22:44.928 --> 22:46.190
[telephone ringing]

22:48.192 --> 22:49.890
Always let it ring twice.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.940
To whom do I owe the pleasure?

22:57.158 --> 22:58.812
<i>Mr Cohn, this is J. Stanley
Pottinger,</i>

22:58.986 --> 23:00.379
<i>Head of Civil Rights Division,</i>

23:00.553 --> 23:02.250
<i>United States Department
of Justice.</i>

23:02.946 --> 23:04.731
Wow, I'm sure your mother's
very proud.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.820
<i>How dare you threaten one of
my attorneys?</i>

23:06.994 --> 23:08.299
<i>I should have you disbarred
for speaking to her that way.</i>

23:08.474 --> 23:10.606
Stan, Stan, bubala,
why don't you calm down?

23:10.780 --> 23:12.652
That never happened.
<i>- Barbara Katz has worked for me</i>

23:12.826 --> 23:14.523
<i>for 20 years.
You threatened her.</i>

23:14.697 --> 23:16.090
<i>And now she...</i>
- Sounds like

23:16.264 --> 23:18.005
maybe she's hormonal,
or something like that.

23:18.179 --> 23:19.398
<i>What did you say?</i>
[telephone slams]

23:19.572 --> 23:22.052
Rule two, admit nothing.
[dramatic music]

23:22.662 --> 23:23.924
Deny everything.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.099
Objection.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.317
Uh, the Civil Rights Division

23:26.492 --> 23:28.189
did not file a lawsuit.

23:28.363 --> 23:32.149
Frankly, it compiled a, uh,
48-page, uh, press release,

23:32.323 --> 23:33.673
as far as I can tell.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.023
Now, the government has
failed to spell out

23:36.197 --> 23:39.069
one single fact concerning
alleged

23:39.243 --> 23:42.421
discriminatory practices
against blacks by the Trumps.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.988
Uh, I motion to have this case
dismissed

23:45.162 --> 23:47.077
on summary judgement.
- Overruled.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.777
Councillor, continue.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.082
Thank you, Your Honour.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.606
Agent Green, what led you

23:53.780 --> 23:55.303
to believe that you were denied

23:55.477 --> 23:58.001
a lease at Trump Properties
based on your race?

23:58.175 --> 23:59.829
Well, not only did
the newspaper advertise...

24:00.003 --> 24:02.353
That's Walter, DOJ,
he runs the show.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.964
AGENT GREEN: I saw three
Caucasian couples

24:04.138 --> 24:05.487
approved before me.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.271
ROY: Objection, speculation.
- Mr Cohn...

24:07.446 --> 24:09.012
How can you say for sure they
were Caucasian?

24:09.186 --> 24:11.101
Mr Cohn, please allow
Agent Green

24:11.275 --> 24:12.625
to answer the question.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.278
I've seen Puerto Ricans
whiter than my tush

24:14.453 --> 24:16.498
after a long winter.
[courtroom laughs]

24:16.933 --> 24:18.805
Your Honour...
[gavel banging]

24:20.937 --> 24:22.330
- Mr Cohn.
- Marvin, how are you?

24:22.504 --> 24:23.636
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

24:23.810 --> 24:24.680
How do you feel about your
chances?

24:24.854 --> 24:26.029
Uh, the government's case

24:26.203 --> 24:27.727
is phoney as a
three-dollar bill.

24:27.901 --> 24:30.033
Uh, let's just say we're in
a very strong position.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.688
Mr Trump, do you think you
can beat the US government?

24:32.862 --> 24:33.776
I feel very good about this.

24:33.950 --> 24:34.864
One more question, Mr Trump.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.387
Mr Trump, one more question.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.738
We're really gonna win,
aren't we?

24:39.390 --> 24:41.436
Are you out of your mind?
Of course not.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.613
- What?
- Donald, uh,

24:44.787 --> 24:46.310
your case is a total dog.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.095
But, but you said they had
no evidence.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.837
Your leasing agents marked
black applications with a C.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.753
That C didn't stand for cotton
candy now, did it?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.887
Raul, I'm late for a little, uh, rendezvous.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.019
Step on it.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.761
Roy, you said we'd win
hands-down.

25:02.022 --> 25:05.678
Rule three, this is the most
important rule of all, okay?

25:05.852 --> 25:06.853
No matter what happens...

25:07.027 --> 25:08.289
Does he have to drive this fast?

25:08.463 --> 25:09.377
...no matter what they say
about you,

25:09.551 --> 25:11.031
no matter how beaten you are,

25:11.205 --> 25:13.599
you claim victory and never
admit defeat.

25:13.773 --> 25:16.166
Never admit defeat, Donald.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.777
You want to win,
that's how you win.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.822
[car roars]
[dramatic music]

25:23.826 --> 25:26.960
Walter, my good friend,
what a nice surprise.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.832
It's, uh, nice to see you too,
Roy.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.619
Your bulldog, Katz, uh,
she's being tough on us.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.446
Barbara is one of our best.

25:37.013 --> 25:38.972
You know, uh,
this case isn't fair.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.713
You and I both know that.

25:40.887 --> 25:41.670
Well, you know what, Roy,

25:41.844 --> 25:43.193
justice is complicated.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.108
- Justice is complicated?
- Yeah.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.981
You know what could get
complicated, Walter?

25:49.156 --> 25:51.854
Is a, uh, a married man

25:52.507 --> 25:54.596
committing certain indiscretions

25:54.901 --> 25:57.599
with the, uh, cabana boys in
Cancun.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.307
The last I checked,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.483
homosexuals were barred from

26:12.658 --> 26:14.311
federal civil service.

26:20.404 --> 26:21.710
What do you want, Roy?

26:21.971 --> 26:23.233
Why don't you do the right thing

26:23.407 --> 26:25.496
and make this case go away?

26:25.801 --> 26:27.237
You know I can't do that.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.198
Imagine your wife

26:31.372 --> 26:33.766
reading in the Post that, uh...

26:33.940 --> 26:35.898
- Roy...
- ...her husband's a fairy.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.553
Is that what you want?

26:38.727 --> 26:40.294
[background music playing]

26:46.648 --> 26:48.041
Say hello to Mira and the kids.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.395
- What? I'm not gonna bite.
- That was tremendous.

26:54.569 --> 26:55.831
Why don't you sit down?

26:56.484 --> 26:57.659
[Donald sighs]

26:59.748 --> 27:01.924
You're all the way over
in Alaska. Come here.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.099
Well...

27:04.797 --> 27:05.841
What?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.756
I don't know, Roy. I mean, I...

27:09.671 --> 27:11.891
I'm pretty sure what
I just saw was, uh...

27:15.111 --> 27:17.723
I, I, I don't even know what...
what to think of that.

27:17.897 --> 27:18.941
I mean, I'm...

27:20.290 --> 27:21.552
I'm speechless.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.600
Here's the thing, Donald, uh,

27:26.079 --> 27:28.429
you played, uh, you played
sports, right?

27:29.038 --> 27:31.954
So, they probably taught you,
uh,

27:32.520 --> 27:34.565
play the ball, not the man.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.133
But, uh, you see, in reality,

27:37.307 --> 27:38.831
it's the total opposite.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.660
You play the man, not the ball.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.576
Okay? To get what you want,
forget the ball.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.143
You get the man.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.059
This is a nation of men,
not laws.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.891
And, uh, you don't care?

27:56.065 --> 27:57.501
It's an advantage...

27:59.199 --> 28:01.636
to, uh, not care what people
think of you.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.117
Fuck what people think of you.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.033
There is no right and wrong.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.513
There is no, uh, morality.

28:09.775 --> 28:13.735
There is no truth
with a capital "T".

28:13.909 --> 28:16.259
It's a construct.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.566
It's a fiction. It's man-made.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.177
None of it matters except
winning.

28:21.743 --> 28:22.701
That's it.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.533
[siren wailing]

28:31.710 --> 28:34.495
<i>To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent</i>

28:34.669 --> 28:37.063
<i>to every instinct in my body.</i>

28:37.237 --> 28:40.066
<i>But as president,
I must put the interests</i>

28:40.370 --> 28:41.763
<i>of America first.</i>

28:42.198 --> 28:43.678
<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

28:43.852 --> 28:45.375
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

28:45.549 --> 28:47.247
<i>It is the first priority</i>
[telephone ringing]

28:47.421 --> 28:48.727
<i>of my presidency</i>

28:48.901 --> 28:51.077
<i>to sustain and strengthen</i>

28:52.165 --> 28:54.515
[telephone ringing]
<i>the mutual trust and respect...</i>

28:55.559 --> 28:57.344
<i>which must exist...</i>
- Hello?

28:57.518 --> 28:58.911
<i>Never answer your own phone,</i>

28:59.085 --> 29:02.044
uh, like some loser.
Get a secretary.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.003
- How's it going?
<i>- Listen, the judge, uh,</i>

29:04.177 --> 29:05.744
<i>called with news about
the suit.</i>

29:06.962 --> 29:08.007
Well, what did they say?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.051
Well, the government folded

a hundred reporters

29:31.726 --> 29:33.467

to get this interview,

29:33.641 --> 29:35.077
and I gave you the exclusive.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.036
There you go.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.474
Uh, yes, hello, Judy, uh, this
is Donald Trump.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.042
Very excited... very excited
to talk to you.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.783
[whispers] Be excited,
don't say you're excited.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.132
<i>So, Donald, now that the
lawsuit is behind you,</i>

29:46.306 --> 29:47.220
<i>what do you want to do next?</i>

29:47.394 --> 29:48.569
Uh, well...

29:48.743 --> 29:50.919
I intend to acquire
the Commodore,

29:51.093 --> 29:53.400
and, uh, I'm planning on making
it the, the best

29:53.574 --> 29:55.881
uh, and the finest building
in... in the city,

29:56.055 --> 29:57.926
maybe... maybe the country.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.885
In the world, Judy,
in the world.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.408
It's gonna be the finest
building in the world.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.323
It's gonna be a spectacular
hotel.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.151
Absolutely spectacular.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.369
First class.

30:06.543 --> 30:07.544
And, uh...

30:07.718 --> 30:09.459

<i>Where do you get the drive?
You're still so young, Donald.</i>

30:11.635 --> 30:13.768
I've got, I've got flair
and I'm smart, so I...

30:13.942 --> 30:15.552
I think that's gonna
make me successful.

30:15.726 --> 30:18.164
- Slow down, slow down...
- But I also wanna stay humble.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.643
I'm...

30:20.079 --> 30:22.385
Uh, sorry Judy, listen let's,
uh, do rest in person,

30:22.559 --> 30:24.605
and, uh, bring a photographer, okay?

30:25.475 --> 30:27.477
[telephone clangs]
Sorry, Roy.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.044
- Uh, no, I mean, listen...
- You caught me off guard.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.829
It's you're life.
Uh, you got a ways to go,

30:31.003 --> 30:32.874
but, uh, you're learning.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.050
You know, I should've talked
to Dad,

30:35.224 --> 30:36.617
before announcing
the Commodore.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.793
He'll be convinced when he
reads about it

30:38.967 --> 30:40.273
in the Times, okay?

30:40.447 --> 30:41.709
- Well...
- You create your own reality.

30:41.883 --> 30:42.797
It's not that easy.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.581
Truth is a malleable thing.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.235
- But he's...
- These are too tight, I think.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.802
Alright, well... I'm sorry.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.065
You have kind of a big ass,
you know that?

30:50.239 --> 30:51.327
You gotta work on that.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.329
We... we try something else.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.897
Look, my dad is tough, Roy.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.377
He's very tough.
- Well, that's why you gotta

30:57.551 --> 30:59.161
spread the news,
like it's already happening.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.120
It's just, you can't push him
around very easily.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.210
Fine, okay, fine, then, uh,
let him push you around.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.298
Is that what you want?

31:05.472 --> 31:06.429
No, I don't.

31:06.603 --> 31:07.648
Look.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.956
Very, very fine fabric. Brioni.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.522
What is that, merino wool?

31:13.523 --> 31:14.655
Looks expensive.

31:14.829 --> 31:15.656
How much is this?

31:15.830 --> 31:17.614
- $1,100.
- Okay, that's...

31:17.788 --> 31:20.226
Okay, we'll take it,
and a matching shirt and tie.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.792
- I...I can't pay for this.
- Forget it, okay?

31:21.967 --> 31:23.577
Forget it. Listen, here.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.362
I don't need your money.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.278
You'll pay me back, uh,
with your friendship, okay?

31:29.452 --> 31:30.845
Quid pro quo. Uh...

31:31.019 --> 31:33.108
you be a friend to me,
I'll be a friend to you.

31:33.674 --> 31:36.677
Okay? That's, uh,
that's... that's the pact, okay?

31:37.373 --> 31:38.853
If you look like
a million bucks,

31:39.027 --> 31:40.550
I look like a million bucks.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.772
Is this a guy, uh, is this a guy
from Flushing,

31:44.946 --> 31:46.600
or is this a guy from
5th Avenue?

31:46.774 --> 31:48.123
You know what I'm saying?
- No, 5th Avenue.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.298
- That's right.
- 5th Avenue's where we wanna be.

31:49.472 --> 31:50.343
- That's right.
- Exactly.

Only members are allowed inside.

32:14.236 --> 32:15.455
They can become members.

32:15.629 --> 32:16.935
They can file the papers right
now.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.066
I've asked you once to leave.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.676
I want to speak to your boss.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.114
- I am the boss. The answer's no.
- You're not the boss.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.115
- I am the boss.
- I want to speak

32:23.289 --> 32:24.464

32:24.638 --> 32:25.944
- I'm sorry you're upset.
- Excuse me.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.251
Um, what's the issue?

32:29.425 --> 32:31.645
I'm sorry, Mr Trump, I was just
trying to get them to leave.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.256
Well, actually, they're on
the list.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.041
We don't need your help.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.043
And what list would that be?

32:38.652 --> 32:41.002
The, uh, Roy Cohn list.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.484
My apologies, Mr Trump.

your coat off?

- Stereotype.

A man who thinks women
need his help.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.247
Well, you, uh, you were totally
failing without me,

33:08.421 --> 33:10.640
so, I guess you needed my
help a little bit.

33:11.772 --> 33:13.469
What's the catch, gentleman?

33:15.297 --> 33:16.907
No catch.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.778
Rupert is gonna be key for you.

38:22.952 --> 38:26.042
You wanna get quoted in the
Post and all the papers a lot,

38:26.216 --> 38:27.870
you know, keep your name in
the papers.

38:28.044 --> 38:29.045
Oh, that's my accountant.

38:29.219 --> 38:31.918
- Uh, really?
- Uh, listen,

38:32.092 --> 38:35.051
you'd better work on
the, uh, Commodore pitch, okay?

38:35.225 --> 38:36.923
Brush up on that, because
I got you a sit-down

38:37.097 --> 38:38.533
with the CEO of Hyatt.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.579
- Jay Pritzker?
- Yeah, Pritzker, who else?

38:40.753 --> 38:41.971
Roy, that's amazing.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.583
- Roy, that's...
- Okay?

It's great to see so many old
friends and, uh, new ones.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.520
I love this country.

39:08.998 --> 39:11.784
I think of America as my most
important client.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.264
Some of you are my clients,
and I hate to break it to you,

39:14.439 --> 39:16.354
but America is more important.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.878
We are the last line of defence

39:19.052 --> 39:20.793
between a free world

40:58.978 --> 41:02.198
Well, gentlemen, this is
a monumental opportunity.

41:02.372 --> 41:03.722
The Grand Central area is one of

41:03.896 --> 41:05.941
the most important
locations in the city.

41:06.115 --> 41:08.596
The Chrysler Building is there,
the Pan Am Building is there,

41:08.770 --> 41:09.945
the whole area is monumental.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.643
And the key to the whole area

41:11.817 --> 41:13.471
is the old Commodore Hotel,

41:13.645 --> 41:14.863
which is just sitting there
boarded up

41:15.037 --> 41:16.778
and waiting to be transformed.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.563
I wanna make it something
very special,

41:18.737 --> 41:20.390
I wanna build an incredible,

41:20.565 --> 41:21.914
glorious, glamorous hotel

41:22.088 --> 41:23.002
that's gonna put people to work

41:23.176 --> 41:24.090
in the construction trades,

41:24.264 --> 41:25.439
it's gonna save hotel jobs.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.049
It's been a brutal year
for New York,

41:27.223 --> 41:29.269
we're... we're one step away
from depression,

41:29.791 --> 41:31.619
and we have to bring it back.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.099
Thank you.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.797
Commodore Hotel is a great idea,

41:35.971 --> 41:38.539
but not only is it in shambles,

41:38.713 --> 41:40.585
but everything around it
as well.

41:41.150 --> 41:44.023
Everything on that city block

41:44.197 --> 41:46.895
is going to need to be rebuilt.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.418
I'd love to do that.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.551
I think that destination's
a great word.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.597
You know, it brings people
to... to Manhattan.

41:52.771 --> 41:53.815

41:53.989 --> 41:55.077

Mr Pritzker, any questions?

42:01.170 --> 42:02.128
Just one.

42:02.302 --> 42:04.086
Between the unions and taxes...

42:05.392 --> 42:06.785
how will you make money?

42:08.134 --> 42:12.442
Um... well, that's a... that's
a really interesting question.

42:12.617 --> 42:13.792
Um...

42:14.096 --> 42:15.794
well, there won't be
any taxes, Jay,

42:15.968 --> 42:19.449
because, uh, we're gonna get
a tax abatement from the mayor,

42:20.059 --> 42:23.149

to build, okay?

42:23.366 --> 42:25.238
And if I tell him that the CEO
of Hyatt is committing,

42:25.412 --> 42:27.414
then I can get him to waive
the property taxes.

42:29.111 --> 42:30.069
The city is broke,
and you're saying

42:30.243 --> 42:31.592

a much needed,

uh, blood infusion and,
uh, resuscitate the corpse

is support

45:21.414 --> 45:23.198

45:23.372 --> 45:25.548
it is also true that the city is

You have to be willing to do
anything to anyone to win.

47:29.498 --> 47:32.632
This has been one of
the toughest votes we've had.

47:32.806 --> 47:35.287
There's a lot of strong feelings
on both sides.

47:36.244 --> 47:38.812
You have to be willing to
exploit your enemies

47:38.986 --> 47:40.422
and instil fear.

47:42.424 --> 47:45.993
Our responsibility is to do
what's best for New York.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.213

investment.

for Mr Trump's tax abatement.

of yourself!

in this house!

48:16.937 --> 48:18.199
Donald, wake up.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.420
You know, when I tried
the Rosenbergs,

48:22.769 --> 48:24.510
I wanted so badly

48:24.814 --> 48:26.686
to see those pinko kikes fry

48:26.860 --> 48:28.166
for what they did.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.430
Now, uh, Judge Kaufman
had no trouble

48:31.604 --> 48:32.910
sending Julius to the chair,

48:33.084 --> 48:35.303
but, uh, Ethel was a mother

48:35.477 --> 48:36.435
with young kids.

48:36.609 --> 48:38.219
They wanted her to live.

48:38.393 --> 48:41.527
As if that's some sort of
special immunity

48:41.701 --> 48:43.572
for betraying your country.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.531
So, during the trial,

48:45.705 --> 48:47.402
I'd slip out at lunch
to a phone booth

48:47.576 --> 48:49.535
and, uh, call Kaufman.

48:49.796 --> 48:51.929
You know, technically
ex parte conversations,

48:52.103 --> 48:55.845
they're not allowed, but, uh,
when democracy is at stake,

48:56.846 --> 49:00.285

I don't think somebody's over

all the help he can get.

01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:43.264
I saw West Side Story

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:45.527

- West Side Story. [laughs]

You know what, Fred?
Uh, I just fixed

01:01:48.313 --> 01:01:49.706
what others couldn't.

01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:51.795
Well, I appreciate it, Roy.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.448
Thank you for doing that.

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.364

- No, it didn't seem right.

It's... it's going fine,
it's great.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.727

Don't worry about a speech.
- Nah.

with, uh, TWA?

to do a speech.

It's ridiculous, okay?
Trees don't need money to grow.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.048
The city really should let
developers build over the park,

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:50.963
'cause it's prime real estate.

01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:53.226
And stop trying to be friends
with these Park Avenue phonies.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.880
They don't care about you.

01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:56.403
I mean, the way you're posing
for the cameras,

01:06:56.577 --> 01:06:58.188
it's like you're, you're begging
for attention.

01:06:58.362 --> 01:06:59.885
Donald, I'm posing because they
want to shoot me.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.408
- Oh, really?
- Don't get jealous.

01:07:01.582 --> 01:07:03.019
- Don't get jealous.
- I'm not jealous, okay?

01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:04.672
If anybody's jealous,
they're jealous of me.

01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:06.196
You are getting jealous.
You're getting a little jealous.

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.936
No, no, no. They're jealous
of me, Ivana,

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.547
because nobody's tried...
- Because you're with me.

01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:11.331
- on any scale of what I'm trying
to do in the city.

01:07:11.505 --> 01:07:12.376
- Because you're with me.
- No-one's built what I've built

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:14.117
at my age, alright?

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.988
I cannot sit.
[Donald sighs]

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:18.730
It's just, it's Koch, okay?
He's being a piece of work,

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:21.167
and that's the problem.
He's not gonna budge, alright?

01:07:21.341 --> 01:07:22.864
Here, let me help you
with the shoes.

01:07:23.604 --> 01:07:25.432
He just wants a bit more money.
That's it.

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:28.000
Ivana, I gave him $50,000.
[Donald Jr crying]

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:30.568
- What does Roy say?
- Roy's useless!

01:07:30.742 --> 01:07:32.613
What do you mean, what he said?
By the way, the FBI

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.528
raided his house this morning.

01:07:34.702 --> 01:07:36.661
He owes them $7 million
in taxes.

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:38.793
But it doesn't matter, I don't
need Roy, I don't need anybody.

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:40.621
I'm gonna go on television
and tell the people

01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:43.102
what a loser Koch is, okay,
and that he's a one-line artist

01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:45.409
that doesn't care about anything
other than looking good.

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:47.106
[Donald Jr crying]
What's the matter with him?

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.455
What's the matter with him?
Why are you crying?

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:50.370
Don Jr, come here. Come here.

01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:51.763
Come here. Come here,
look at me...

01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:52.807
- Hey bubba.
- Look at me, look at me.

01:07:52.981 --> 01:07:54.418
Look at me, look at me. You see?

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.681
Everything's okay.
Don Jr, everything's okay.

01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:59.292
Look over there. You see New
York City? That's your city.

01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:01.686
Listen, you're a New
York City kid.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.340
Do you see right there... yes?

01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:04.471
That one, that one,
is that one your favourite?

01:08:04.645 --> 01:08:05.385
Which one's your favourite?

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:06.517
I think he's just tired.

01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:07.996
[Don Jr crying]
Donald...

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:09.868
[Don Jr crying]
It's okay.

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:11.478
I guess I'm terrible
with babies.

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:13.089
I dunno what you want me to say.
[Don Jr crying]

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:14.438
Who is that?

01:08:14.612 --> 01:08:15.961
- My name's Freddy...
DONALD: Freddy!

01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:17.484
FREDDY: Hey, will you tell
this guy who I am?

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:19.356
- He knows.
- I'm his brother.

01:08:19.530 --> 01:08:21.184
When, uh, when, when did you get
into town?

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.490
Uh, just a couple days ago.

01:08:23.664 --> 01:08:25.797
I've been calling you,
but you didn't return my calls.

01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.147
- Mm. You don't look too good.
- Yeah.

01:08:28.321 --> 01:08:31.890
- Are you sick?
- I brought this for Don Jr.

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:34.240
Maybe I can go give it to him.
- Uh, that's okay, that's okay.

01:08:34.414 --> 01:08:35.850
Listen, I'll, I'll give it
to him, alright?

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.591
I'll give it to him.
[toy car clunks]

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:39.289
What's going on?
I didn't know you were in town.

01:08:39.637 --> 01:08:41.508
Look, Donnie, I know,
I know, uh,

01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:45.947
you know, I know I'm a loser
and, uh, all that, but, uh,

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:48.602
you know, my, my grip's,
kind of, uh,

01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.648
kind of slipping a little bit,
you know?

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:55.348
And, uh, it's, it's getting
kind of, uh, you know,

01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:58.264
things are getting a little bit,
uh, scary, and uh...

01:08:58.438 --> 01:09:01.398
- Hm.
- I...you know, I wanna, I wanna,

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.748
I wanna change and...
- Mm-hm.

01:09:03.922 --> 01:09:05.402
[sobs]

01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:07.839
Just, just take it easy, okay?
It's gonna be alright.

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.233
We're gonna figure this out.
I'll, I'll help you, alright?

01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:12.452
- Yeah.
- Okay? Alright.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.628
It's alright, buddy.
We're gonna figure this out.

01:09:14.802 --> 01:09:16.239
[patting]

01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:18.415
- Alright? Don't worry.
- Freddy, how are you?

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:21.505
- Wow, you... Ivana, hi.
- He got a toy for...

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.071
I didn't know you were
in the city.

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:25.726
- Should I make up the guestroom?
FREDDY: Yeah.

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.208
Um, well, I mean, you know,
we also have, uh,

01:09:29.382 --> 01:09:31.167
didn't you say your family's
coming to town, right?

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:33.430
You know, why don't you stay
at a hotel tonight?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:36.607
Here, get, get a hotel
for, for, for tonight,

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.696
and then, uh,
let's talk tomorrow.

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.002
You know, we'll, we'll sort
something out, alright?

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:45.006
Just, just for tonight, alright?

01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:47.748
Come on, Freddy, don't put
this on me, alright?

01:09:47.922 --> 01:09:50.186
I mean, you think it's easy for
me to watch you waste your life?

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.191
[door shuts]

01:09:59.456 --> 01:10:00.457
Poor Freddy.

01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:04.765
[upbeat music]

01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:07.464
NEWS PRESENTER: <i>Donald Trump's
biggest accomplishment to date</i>

01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:09.030
<i>is the Grand Hyatt.</i>

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:12.033
<i>Now an even more ambitious plan
is in the works,</i>

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.863
<i>a bold new skyscraper,
a prime Fifth Avenue location,</i>

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:18.214
<i>neighbouring the famous
Tiffany's store.</i>

01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:19.867
DONALD: Taller? Well,
it could've been taller.

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.478
It could've been
a lot taller, actually.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:24.045
I wanted to build taller
than the Twin Towers.

01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:26.439
I may still do that,
I don't know.

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:28.833
- We're still building, so...
- We were gonna do taller,

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:30.835
but it's not gonna be
as beautiful as this one.

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:32.445
It's most important what
is inside

01:10:32.619 --> 01:10:34.230
than what was gonna be outside.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:36.362
<i>Trump's vision is shared
by his wife, Ivana,</i>

01:10:36.536 --> 01:10:38.973
<i>a former fashion model
turned interior designer.</i>

01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:40.366
Like, come over here.

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:43.108
The floor, the floor is gonna
be pink marble.

01:10:43.282 --> 01:10:44.457
Gonna be pink marble,
I'm gonna bring

01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:46.372
a whole mountain from Italy.

01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:49.375
Ivana's gonna design the floors,
I'm gonna design the ceilings.

01:10:49.549 --> 01:10:52.378
<i>But it's his feud
with outspoken Mayor Ed Koch</i>

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:55.076
<i>that may make him best known
to New Yorkers.</i>

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:58.166
Well, he's a one-line artist,
uh, I, I mean, you know,

01:10:58.341 --> 01:10:59.820
uh, when it
<i>comes to running the city,</i>

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:01.779
<i>he's about as bad
as anybody I've seen.</i>

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:04.521
<i>I would say he's got no talent
and only moderate intelligence.</i>

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:10.091
Is this an appropriate way to
talk about an elected official?

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:13.051
Ed Koch has been a disaster
for New York and, uh,

01:11:13.225 --> 01:11:14.792
he's done a lousy job
as the mayor.

01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:16.533
Anybody that lives in New York
knows it.

01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:18.622
And people understand that
in order to be successful

01:11:18.796 --> 01:11:20.276
you have to have
a certain instinct to win.

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:23.888
Donald, you're a mover,
you are a doer.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:27.457
If you could make America
perfect, how would you do it?

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:31.939
Well, I think that America's
a country that has tremendous,

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:34.377
tremendous potential. I think
that much like the mind,

01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:37.293
I think America's using very,
very little of its potential.

01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:39.686
I really feel that. But I also
feel that it's a country

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.211
that gets no respect
from other countries.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:45.388
None. Zero.

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:48.608
And uh, and that's a shame,
isn't it?

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:52.699
Tell me this, what if you lost
your fortune today?

01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:54.527
What would you do?
- Well, then maybe I'll run

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:57.356
for president, I don't know.
- Well, you'd do very well.

01:11:57.748 --> 01:11:59.663
Well, I'm only kidding obviously
when I say that,

01:11:59.837 --> 01:12:02.492
I'm just being facetious, but...
- No, it's a good answer.

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.581
[protesters chanting]

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:08.367
[horns honking]

01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:10.021
Listen, you're gonna love
Atlantic City.

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:12.328
I got this guy Sullivan,
uh, he's a killer.

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:14.199
[protestors chanting]

01:12:14.504 --> 01:12:16.767
Simon! Find a way
through, alright?

01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:18.246
We gotta get to the heliport.

01:12:18.595 --> 01:12:19.857
Oh, it's that gay cancer.

01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:21.598
[window thudding]

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.427
[horns honking]
[window thudding]

01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:27.299
He just wiped his face all over
the fucking glass.

01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:28.605
[protesters shouting]
[window thudding]

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:30.563
Get out of my face.

01:12:30.737 --> 01:12:32.173
Run 'em over, Simon.

01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.350
Come on, Simon!

01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:35.960
I'm kidding.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.440
[upbeat music]

01:12:43.184 --> 01:12:44.882
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:48.668
DONALD: Atlantic City
is just beginning.

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:52.063
It's virtually untouched land.

01:12:52.237 --> 01:12:53.499
There's so much potential.

01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:55.588
Atlantic City has peaked,
Donald.

01:12:55.762 --> 01:12:57.242
Once other states
legalise gaming,

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:59.157
you'll have competition
lining up,

01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:00.898
plus you don't know the first
thing about running a casino.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:02.508
I know a lot about running
a casino, Roy.

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:03.988
I'm not worried about that.

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:05.206
Why don't you finish
Trump Tower first?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.165
Done. Basically finished.

01:13:07.339 --> 01:13:08.862
I think your balls
are swelling a little too much.

01:13:09.036 --> 01:13:10.342
It's gonna be fine, Roy.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.997
You gotta... you gotta think
about the future.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.913
The future's coming.
The future's here right now.

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:18.655
- I am think...
- The future is in Atlantic City.

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:20.526
[upbeat music]

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.357

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:27.838
[cheering]

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.451
I see now, this is what
a goldmine looks like.

01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:34.714
In human flesh.
- Unbelievable.

01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:36.020
Unbelievable, huh?

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:36.803
People see what
you're building...

01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:37.935
He's excited.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:39.066
You know how excited he is?

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:39.937
Yeah. That's his excited face!

01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:42.113
[cheering, clapping]

01:13:42.287 --> 01:13:44.724
Woo! Hey, did you win?
[cheering]

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:47.423
Did you win?
You look like a winner.

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.250
- Where are you from?
- Georgia.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.817
Georgia's my favourite.

01:13:51.383 --> 01:13:52.515
- There she is.
- How many machines?

01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:53.646
67 machines.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.517
Well, we're gonna put in

01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:56.170
3,000, alright?

01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:57.389
And then we'll pack every
grandma in the world

01:13:57.563 --> 01:13:58.782
in this place.
[Sullivan laughs]

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:00.479
We're gonna suck this place dry.
- Yeah!

01:14:00.653 --> 01:14:02.263
Applying for a gaming licence
is gonna take, uh,

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.309
eight, ten months minimum.
- Not if you're this guy.

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:05.702
See, they're always losing.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.051
They're always losing
back there.

01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:08.487
ROY: Look, this, this uh,

01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:10.533
this place
is about as much Las Vegas

01:14:10.707 --> 01:14:12.970
as my Aunt Libby is Grace Kelly.
DONALD: Fantastic is what it is.

01:14:13.144 --> 01:14:14.406
It's gonna better
than Las Vegas.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.713
It's totally cheap and grubby

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.454
and it's gonna be bad
for your brand.

01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:19.759
Roy, you know, you're being so
negative all the...

01:14:19.933 --> 01:14:23.023
What is this? Is this free food?
Wow.

01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:24.808
Uh, I might have to
get in there.

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:26.853
Cheese balls over here.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.769
Hoo-hoo, they look nice and hot.

01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:31.771
- What are you doing?
- You want one?

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:33.643
No, it looks totally disgusting.

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:35.296
Cheese balls.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.560
Listen, what do you think
about midget boxing?

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:39.257
I think people will love it.

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.346
I don't think very much
about midget boxing, Donald.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.130
When I do Trump Tower,
people love it.

01:14:43.304 --> 01:14:45.045
Everything I do is turning
to gold, alright?

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:46.438
Everything's gonna work out.
It's fine.

01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:48.266
But this is, this is not
a goldmine.

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.748
You're expanding too fast, okay?
- Oh, here we go.

01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:54.577
You're gonna be overleveraged
and you're gonna have debt, uh,

01:14:54.751 --> 01:14:56.927
up to your ears
and I don't advise it.

01:14:57.971 --> 01:14:59.930
I know what I'm doing, okay?

01:15:00.452 --> 01:15:02.585
You've been negative the whole
day. I mean, what's going on?

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:04.282
Well, I'm getting a little tired

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:06.153
of you not listening
to me anymore.

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.460
I do listen to you.
Just act a little bit more

01:15:08.634 --> 01:15:10.636
like my attorney
and less like my dad,

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:12.551
'cause I already got one,
he's a pain in the ass.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:18.731
Fine. You know, uh, you know
what lawyers do, Donald?

01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:20.733
They charge their clients.

01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:25.303
Okay.

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:27.479
Send me the bill.

01:15:28.045 --> 01:15:29.263
That make you feel better?

01:15:29.437 --> 01:15:30.656
Good, fine.
I'll send you a bill.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.179
Great.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.747
I can pay you, 'cause I have
money, 'cause I'm successful.

01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:36.662
- Right.
- Alright?

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:37.968
STAFF: I'm sorry. Mr Trump?
- And, uh, who, who, who, uh...

01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:39.578
Listen, I'm worried about you.

01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:42.059
You're stressed,
you're sensitive.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:43.277
I mean, what's going on?

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:45.845
STAFF: Telephone for you.

01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:48.369
Yes.

01:15:50.023 --> 01:15:50.894
Mom.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:53.636
What's going on?

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:57.770
[ominous music]

01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:01.469
What?

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.477
When?

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:19.749
PRIEST: He maketh me lie down
in the green pastures,

01:16:19.923 --> 01:16:22.012
he leadeth me beside
the still waters.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.231
He restoreth my soul.

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:27.974
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:30.455
for his name's sake.
[sobbing]

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:33.240
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:36.243
I will fear no evil,

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:37.723
for thou art with me.

01:16:37.897 --> 01:16:40.334
Thy rod, thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:16:42.467 --> 01:16:43.642
Preparest a table before me...

01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:49.082
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.650
Amen.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:53.347
[door opens]

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.394
[door shuts]

01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:59.223
[tap running]

01:16:59.397 --> 01:17:00.790
[hands scrubbing]

01:17:05.925 --> 01:17:07.710
[frantic scrubbing]

01:17:09.886 --> 01:17:11.757
[sobbing, gasping]

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:20.548
[door opens]

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:21.724
[clearing throat]

01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:25.858
What?

01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:28.513
I'm fine, Ivana.

01:17:29.122 --> 01:17:30.123
[sniffs]

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:31.603
You don't need to be fine.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:33.649
Okay.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:41.352
<i>Look at me.
Do you like what you see?</i>

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:45.661
<i>Good, because it's not me,
it's a recording of me...</i>

01:17:51.014 --> 01:17:51.884
Hey...

01:17:56.193 --> 01:17:59.065
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You don't need to be fine.

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:01.807
I'm fine. Stop! Don't!
[sobbing]

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.636
Don't fucking...
Don't fucking come near me!

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:06.594
[sobbing]

01:18:12.905 --> 01:18:14.994
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:19.346
Donald...
[sniffing, sighing]

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.000
[gasping, sniffing]

01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:24.787
[sniffs, clearing throat]

01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:26.527
[sighs]

01:18:32.969 --> 01:18:36.059
Please stop looking at me,
and stop touching me.

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:38.148
[sighing]

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:48.941
"Always On My Mind" by
Pet Shop Boys

01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:51.683
[crowd cheering and applause]

01:18:52.379 --> 01:18:54.164
[camera shutters clicking]

01:18:58.124 --> 01:18:59.473
DONALD: Hello. Thank you.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.915
Mr Trump, how does it feel
to be the golden boy

01:19:06.089 --> 01:19:07.220
of New York City?

01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.787
Fantastic. I feel great.

01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:10.049
Just fantastic. Thank you.

01:19:14.184 --> 01:19:16.055
[cheering and applause]

01:19:18.275 --> 01:19:19.667
Is it glamorous
or is it glamorous?

01:19:19.842 --> 01:19:21.321
- I think it's glamorous.
- What is it?

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:22.540
When you're willing to spend
the kind of money

01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:23.976
that I've spent...

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:26.196
Are you gonna perform tonight?
Great.

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:27.458
Smile.

01:19:28.589 --> 01:19:30.026
[Ivana laughs]

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:32.680
A lot of people said Trump Tower
could not be done,

01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:34.813
and uh, in fact our loser mayor
tried everything

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.597
to deny the city this great
building, and he's lost.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.034
He's simply lost.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.644
We've got the best people
buying in;

01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.037
Carson, Spielberg,
Prince Charles and Diana.

01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:42.734
Everybody wants a piece
of Trump.

01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:45.084
Fantastic, fantastic.
Oh, I think I see Mr Cohn!

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:46.477
- Oh, alright.
- How are you, Randy?

01:19:46.651 --> 01:19:48.174
- Very well.
- Here he is.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.872
- How you doing tonight?
- I'm good, I'm very excited.

01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:51.656
It's, uh, very exciting.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.440
Call you.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:55.921
I've never met anyone
who reminds me more of myself.

01:19:56.095 --> 01:19:58.924
Donald, he's got grit,
he is, uh,

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.448
relentless in the pursuit
of perfection.

01:20:01.622 --> 01:20:03.102
Look at this, it's a masterpiece

01:20:03.276 --> 01:20:05.409
uh, marble waterfalls...

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:07.846
Listen, I could've built it
taller than the Twin Towers,

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.456
if I wanted.
- Gentlemen, enjoy your night.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.110
ROY: It's good
to see you, Randy.

01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:13.547
Donald, could, could I talk
to you for a minute?

01:20:13.721 --> 01:20:15.027
- Yeah, sure. How are you?
- I've been trying to call you.

01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:16.637
You look like shit.
Can I get an iced water?

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.291
No. I know it's a bad time,
I just...

01:20:18.465 --> 01:20:19.597
What's going on? Are you tired?

01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:21.686
I'm just, uh, overworked,
is all.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:25.168
Alright. Well, maybe you should
try these.

01:20:25.342 --> 01:20:26.386
What are those?

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.085
Diet pills.
I got 'em from my doctor.

01:20:29.259 --> 01:20:30.695
They're amazing for everything.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.697
Energy, sleep.
I don't need to sleep anymore.

01:20:33.176 --> 01:20:35.221
Are you, you sure
that's a good thing?

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:36.614
Well, I can't do deals
when I sleep,

01:20:36.788 --> 01:20:38.529
so yeah, that's a good thing.

01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:41.749
Listen, uh, I just, uh, I need
to ask you a little favour.

01:20:41.924 --> 01:20:44.100
- Sure.
- I was wondering if you might

01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:46.711
be able to put Russell up
at the Hyatt?

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.061
Why?

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:52.238
The country house is...
it's too cold for him.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.545
Uh, he has pneumonia.

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:56.329
Get him a blanket.

01:20:57.113 --> 01:21:00.072
Russell's a good kid and he's,
he's very loyal, uh,

01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:01.769
and it'd mean a lot to me.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.860
Listen, he never helped me,
but I'll do it for you,

01:21:05.034 --> 01:21:06.339
no problem, alright?

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:07.645
Come over here for a second.

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.083
- What?
- Do you think she looks good?

01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:14.086
Oh sure. She looks
like a real beauty queen.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.046
I mean, every night she comes
home telling me what to do.

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.135
I feel like I'm married
to a business partner.

01:21:19.526 --> 01:21:22.268
I don't, I don't feel anything.
I look at her and it's, like...

01:21:23.139 --> 01:21:24.270
Whatever.

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:25.706
At least I got her
to do her tits.

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:27.012
Oh yeah?

01:21:27.186 --> 01:21:28.405
They're amazing.

01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:31.147
Ah, Akio-san!

01:21:31.321 --> 01:21:33.062
- Hey, how are you?
- There you are.

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:34.802
DONALD: Listen, uh, I want,
I want you to see this, uh...

01:21:35.673 --> 01:21:36.761
[coughing]

01:21:42.462 --> 01:21:44.682
What is it with Roy?
He always looks sick.

01:21:46.205 --> 01:21:47.293
No, he's fine.

01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:49.121
MARY ANNE: Wonderful to see you.

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:50.906
Oh no, no...

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.733
- How are you, huh?
- Wonderful.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.648
- What do you think?
- I love this lobby.

01:21:54.822 --> 01:21:56.302
- I planned it myself.
- Oh...

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:57.825
Well, I let her do all
the easy stuff.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.392
[laughter]

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.959
- So, tell me, how do you like?
- Oh, I love it.

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:02.482
- How we doing, Dad?
- Oh, hey.

01:22:02.656 --> 01:22:05.877
- How's the view?
- [laughs] It's alright.

01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:08.053
I wonder what the electric bill
is for that?

01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:10.838
That, that seems impractical.

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.362
Don't worry about that, Dad.

01:22:14.581 --> 01:22:16.409
FRED: You know what this reminds
me of?

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:19.456
When I built, uh, Trump Tower
on Coney Island.

01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:20.892
Trump Village.

01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:23.242
You built Trump Village,
I built Trump Tower.

01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:25.679
- Right.
- This is Trump Tower.

01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:27.638
Right. That's what I meant.

01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:31.903
But when I, when I built that
high rise in, uh,

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.861
in Trump Village, uh,

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:36.125
boats could see it
20 miles out to sea.

01:22:36.299 --> 01:22:38.388
This is very different
than that, Dad, okay?

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:40.172
This is... this is
the big league.

01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:42.566
- The big time.
- Oh, well.

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:44.046
You know, um...

01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:48.180
I've been meaning to say,
you know, uh...

01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:51.792
I know that I've been tough
on you, right?

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:55.492
But look at you now, huh?

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.103
You're a killer. A king.

01:22:58.756 --> 01:22:59.626
Right?

01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:02.673
[dramatic music]

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.370
Right?

01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:06.459
[laughs]
Mm.

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:09.506
Mm.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:11.595
[Fred laughs]

01:23:13.727 --> 01:23:14.859
Try some caviar.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:16.556
It's the best.

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.392
You're gorgeous.

01:23:31.528 --> 01:23:33.399
[sombre music]

01:24:07.868 --> 01:24:08.782
Hey.

01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:14.658
I got you a gift.

01:24:16.703 --> 01:24:18.009
[Donald sighs]

01:24:18.314 --> 01:24:19.228

01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:27.323
The G-spot.

01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:29.847
IVANA: The G-spot.
[case clunks]

01:24:33.503 --> 01:24:35.418
"Experiment with your G-spot
as you may have done

01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:37.811
with your clitoris,
and if and when you learn

01:24:37.985 --> 01:24:41.989
to masturbate that way..."
Oh, that's... great.

01:24:42.338 --> 01:24:44.340
That's, uh, great.

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:46.168
[Ivana giggles]
[book clunks]

01:24:46.342 --> 01:24:48.996
- Wanna go upstairs?
- Listen, uh...

01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:51.912
I gotta tell you, I'm, uh...

01:24:53.697 --> 01:24:54.959
What? Tell me.

01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:57.179
I'm just not attracted
to you anymore.

01:25:00.138 --> 01:25:02.097
[sighs] Donald...

01:25:04.403 --> 01:25:06.971
Really, I mean,
every time I, uh,

01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:09.321
kiss you I feel like, you know,

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:12.585
it's my duty or something.

01:25:12.759 --> 01:25:15.153
I mean, it's, uh...
- Donald...

01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:16.807
And I'm touching you,
I'm touching

01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:19.723
those fake plastic tits.
I mean, I feel weird.

01:25:19.897 --> 01:25:21.028
They were your idea.

01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:22.813
You made me do it.

01:25:22.987 --> 01:25:25.207
Well, maybe they were a mistake.

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:30.168
Donald. Donald...
[clears his throat]

01:25:30.473 --> 01:25:32.170
Can you tell me
what is happening?

01:25:32.823 --> 01:25:34.955
You are behaving like an animal
and you're hurting me.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.696
- Why are you doing this?
- Ivana, I, I...

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:38.089
You don't care how
it makes me feel?

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:39.525
Ivana, I'm just trying
to be honest.

01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:41.440
I'm, I'm... really,
I'm telling you...

01:25:41.614 --> 01:25:43.268
Oh my God. I don't know
what's happening.

01:25:43.442 --> 01:25:44.922
Is it because of the stupid
pills that you're taking?

01:25:45.096 --> 01:25:46.315
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think what's happening is

01:25:46.489 --> 01:25:47.794
you're getting a bit
of a bigger head

01:25:47.968 --> 01:25:49.318
because you're forgetting
your story.

01:25:49.492 --> 01:25:51.189
- You came over here to...
- My story?

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:53.974
from Eastern Czechoslo-fucking-
vakia or whatever the fuck it is

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:56.629
and you married me.
- And where did you come, Donnie?

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:59.154
Where did you come from, hm?
Queens.

01:25:59.328 --> 01:26:02.592
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror, huh? Have you?

01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:05.464
- I have. What's your point?
- Your face look like an orange.

01:26:05.638 --> 01:26:07.423
- Okay, okay.
- And you're getting fat.

01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:09.207
- Right.
- You're getting ugly!

01:26:09.381 --> 01:26:10.687
You're a rude and terrible,
terrible person.

01:26:10.861 --> 01:26:12.297
You're getting bald!
You're disgusting!

01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:14.778
Bald?! I'm not fucking bald!

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.128
Uh!

01:26:17.955 --> 01:26:19.261
Oh, fuck!

01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:20.305
Donald!

01:26:20.914 --> 01:26:22.655

[Ivana sobbing]

01:26:27.965 --> 01:26:30.750
Am I fucking on that G-spot?
Huh?

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:33.927
Is that your G-spot? Huh?

01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:37.540
Did I find it?
Did I fucking find it? Huh?

01:26:37.714 --> 01:26:39.672
How does that feel?
Does that feel good?

01:26:39.977 --> 01:26:41.587
[groaning]
- Huh?

01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:43.241

Yeah...

I'm so overwhelmed, you know.
I've got a lot going on,

01:28:24.603 --> 01:28:26.431
you know, these people are
crawling up my ass down there.

01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:28.390
We got these coin machines.
they're supposed to wait

01:28:28.564 --> 01:28:31.088
eight hours, they've gotta
replace 'em in two hours.

01:28:31.262 --> 01:28:32.829
There's never been people
that are playing that fast

01:28:33.003 --> 01:28:34.091
and that hard.

01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:37.224
Like I told you, fellas,
we're gonna be number one.

01:28:37.399 --> 01:28:38.748
Number one, nobody competes
with it.

01:28:38.922 --> 01:28:40.227
Donald, we need to talk
about the figures...

01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:41.533
And by the way,
here's the difference.

01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:43.100
We're talking about
Atlantic City,

01:28:43.274 --> 01:28:45.276
not Las Vegas. Great job.
- Donald...

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:46.799
Wait, what do we have
in Atlantic City?

01:28:46.973 --> 01:28:48.148
We've got the ocean!

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.715
We've got the ocean right here, fellas.

01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:51.500
We're gonna also make
this the boxing mecca.

01:28:51.674 --> 01:28:53.502
I was talking to Don King
about bringing Mike Tyson

01:28:53.676 --> 01:28:55.417
and various, uh, situations
over here

01:28:55.591 --> 01:28:57.288
because that's gonna be a lot
of money, you know what I mean?

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.724
I think like a prize fighter.
I don't like to tell people

01:28:58.898 --> 01:29:00.596
where I wanna go,
what I wanna do.

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:02.206
I wanna just roll with the
punches, you know what I mean?

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.034
And I think that's gonna be good
for Atlantic City.

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.905
That's great, but we've been
hearing the exact same thing

01:29:06.079 --> 01:29:08.952
since you nearly defaulted on
your loan payment last quarter.

01:29:09.126 --> 01:29:10.214
Yeah, but there's never been
anything like this

01:29:10.388 --> 01:29:11.998
of this magnitude, this quality.

01:29:12.172 --> 01:29:13.609
The Taj Mahal's gonna be
the eighth wonder of the...

01:29:13.783 --> 01:29:15.524
Alright, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:17.264
If you don't make
a goddamn payment

01:29:17.439 --> 01:29:18.918
by the end of this month,

01:29:19.092 --> 01:29:21.138
my bankruptcy attorneys
are gonna be up your ass.

01:29:21.486 --> 01:29:23.053

my credit is solid

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:24.881
and you fellas have nothing
to worry about.

01:29:25.055 --> 01:29:26.317
Last warning, Donald.

01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:27.884
I've got people to answer to.

01:29:34.543 --> 01:29:35.848
[lift humming]

01:29:39.112 --> 01:29:40.723
Do you gamble, Roger?

01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:42.464
You like to gamble, huh?
Play a little slot machine?

01:29:42.638 --> 01:29:43.943
I like to make money,
not lose it. [laughs]

01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:45.380
Well, let me tell you something.
There's gonna be

01:29:45.554 --> 01:29:46.859
a lot of grandmothers
in Atlantic City

01:29:47.033 --> 01:29:47.991
that are gonna be very happy
with that.

01:29:48.165 --> 01:29:49.340
- Oh yeah.
- Okay?

01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:51.908
- The budget, $1 billion.
- Wow!

01:29:52.082 --> 01:29:54.476
- Yeah, you gotta come stay.
- Very Eastern flair, huh?

01:29:54.911 --> 01:29:56.608
- This is something.
- Well, it is, it is.

01:29:56.782 --> 01:29:58.044
[knocking on door]
Yes?

01:29:58.218 --> 01:29:59.263
I've got Roy on the phone.

01:29:59.437 --> 01:30:01.004
Uh, tell him I'll call him back.

01:30:01.178 --> 01:30:02.484
Listen, Reagan's making
this country so fucking rich,

01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:03.876
you can't lose!
- Well...

01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:05.443
I'm telling you, Donald!

01:30:05.704 --> 01:30:07.097
Yeah, he stands for all
the things you care about.

01:30:07.271 --> 01:30:09.012
Lower taxes,
cutting regulations.

01:30:09.926 --> 01:30:11.667
- A powerful military...
- Well, I, I like that.

01:30:11.841 --> 01:30:13.582
- Like it used to be. Right?
- Yes, we need that.

01:30:13.756 --> 01:30:15.322
- We do.
- We need that.

01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:17.499
Hey, in fact, we have a brand
new campaign slogan.

01:30:17.673 --> 01:30:18.717
Listen to this.

01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:22.765
"Let's make America
great again."

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:24.244
DONALD: Wow.

01:30:26.246 --> 01:30:27.857
Hm.

01:30:28.031 --> 01:30:29.380
Well, I like the 'again' part.

01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:31.077
You know, it points
to a great past.

01:30:31.382 --> 01:30:33.253
It does. Not many people
see that.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:35.517
Well, I do, okay?
'Cause I love this country,

01:30:35.691 --> 01:30:38.084
and I'm tired of seeing
this country getting ripped off

01:30:38.258 --> 01:30:39.477
like you wouldn't believe.

01:30:39.651 --> 01:30:41.610
It's losing $200 billion
a year, Roger.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:43.612
$200 billion.
Does Reagan know that?

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.788
'Cause all these, these oil
sheikhs, and the Japs,

01:30:45.962 --> 01:30:47.354
and the welfare queens,
and the union thugs,

01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:48.965
they're sucking us dry.
- You're right.

01:30:49.139 --> 01:30:50.619
It's time to get smart and it's
time to get tough,

01:30:50.793 --> 01:30:51.794
because otherwise there's not
gonna be a country

01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:53.143
and there's not gonna be
a world.

01:30:53.317 --> 01:30:54.579
- And you know who's tough?
- You.

01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:56.276
The Soviets. They get it,
believe me.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:57.930
You're talking about tough
and strong

01:30:58.104 --> 01:30:59.845
Listen, you want me to read,
you know,

01:31:00.019 --> 01:31:01.499
about the missiles, it's gonna
take me an hour and a half.

01:31:01.673 --> 01:31:03.414
I probably know most
of that anyway, so...

01:31:03.588 --> 01:31:05.590
Donald, I'm telling you, I,
I love how passionate you are.

01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:07.157
Have you thought about
running for office?

01:31:07.331 --> 01:31:08.593
Well, look,
I'd run very well, right?

01:31:08.767 --> 01:31:10.334
I mean, but uh, no, no.

01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:12.118
- No?
- Come on, Roger,

01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:14.120
let me tell you something.
Government is for losers.

01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:15.905
- Come on, you'd do great!
- Hey...

01:31:16.079 --> 01:31:17.733
I know politicians, Roger, okay?

01:31:17.907 --> 01:31:20.170
I know politicians better than
anyone, and some of them

01:31:20.344 --> 01:31:22.825
are smart, very few, but most
are dumber than a rock.

01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:24.522
[laughs]
Let's be honest, okay?

01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:26.481
I give money to politicians
so they do what I want.

01:31:26.655 --> 01:31:28.831
They're all very corrupt
and stupid, okay?

01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:30.572
And you know that, Rog.
But you know what?

01:31:30.746 --> 01:31:32.443
I'd love a blow job
on Air Force One.

01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:34.271
I think that'd be
pretty fabulous, alright.

01:31:34.445 --> 01:31:35.881
Hey, I'm sure
it's happened before.

01:31:36.055 --> 01:31:38.057
- Can you make that happen? Huh?
- Yeah, well, hey, hey,

01:31:38.231 --> 01:31:39.929
call me if you change
your mind, okay?

01:31:40.103 --> 01:31:41.452
Well, listen, you get me on
that Air Force One, we'll talk.

01:31:41.626 --> 01:31:43.106
- [laughs] Okay.
- Alright.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.542
Tell Ronnie he's got my support.
[knocking on door]

01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:46.326
- You got it.
- Hang on one second. Yes?

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.328
- Uh, Roy's on the phone again.
- I'll call him later.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.939
- Yeah.
- Anyway...

01:31:50.113 --> 01:31:52.332
Hey, uh, Donald, before I go,
have you, uh,

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:54.726
have you seen Roy lately?
- Uh...

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.121
No, I'm gonna call him back and,
uh, we're gonna talk. Why?

01:31:58.295 --> 01:31:59.296
You haven't heard?

01:31:59.905 --> 01:32:01.211
Heard what?

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:04.910
Well, uh, Russell has AIDS.

01:32:05.084 --> 01:32:06.608
- He's sick as a dog.
- Mm.

01:32:08.305 --> 01:32:10.220
That's, uh... wow,
that's terrible.

01:32:10.394 --> 01:32:11.787
Hey, he still your lawyer?

01:32:12.309 --> 01:32:13.615
Well, he's not my lawyer per se.

01:32:13.789 --> 01:32:15.051
I mean, I have a number
of attorneys, right?

01:32:15.225 --> 01:32:16.095
Different lawyers,
different things.

01:32:16.269 --> 01:32:17.836
- Mm.
- But, um...

01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:20.709
- That's really terrible, Roger.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:32:20.883 --> 01:32:22.232
Well, the world's a mess.

01:32:22.406 --> 01:32:23.712
- Goodbye Donald.
- Yep.

01:32:23.886 --> 01:32:24.843
[door closes]

01:32:29.065 --> 01:32:30.022
Fiona?

01:32:34.984 --> 01:32:35.767
Come over here.

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:37.247
[door closes]

01:32:37.421 --> 01:32:38.553
Uh...

01:32:39.336 --> 01:32:40.555
what did Roy say?

01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:43.470
Not too much, but he's called
three times.

01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:45.647
Does he sound sick?

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.432
Little bit, yeah.
He's got a cough.

01:32:49.476 --> 01:32:51.043
Alright, if he calls again,
just tell him

01:32:51.217 --> 01:32:53.132
I'm out of the office, alright?
And if he shows up,

01:32:53.306 --> 01:32:57.267
put him in the conference room
by himself, okay?

01:32:57.441 --> 01:32:59.182
- Will that be all?
- That's it, thank you.

01:32:59.617 --> 01:33:01.184
[helicopter whirring]

01:33:01.532 --> 01:33:02.577
[door opens]

01:33:04.448 --> 01:33:05.318
[door closes]

01:33:08.887 --> 01:33:10.193
[rustling]

01:33:15.764 --> 01:33:16.721
[scoffs]

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:18.680
[street chatter]

01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:22.335
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Donald!

01:33:22.509 --> 01:33:23.859
Roy!

01:33:24.033 --> 01:33:25.295
Long time no see.

01:33:25.469 --> 01:33:27.471
Is this some kind
of a goddamn joke?

01:33:27.819 --> 01:33:28.864
What is that?

01:33:29.299 --> 01:33:30.996
This? This is how you thank me?

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.999
The manager at the Hyatt
kicked Russell out.

01:33:34.347 --> 01:33:36.132
Alright, that's probably
a mistake.

01:33:36.306 --> 01:33:38.308
Oh, fuck you, Donald!

01:33:39.309 --> 01:33:40.353
Fuck you!

01:33:41.093 --> 01:33:43.052
Uh, your office
sent me the bill.

01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:46.098
- It's a mistake.
- Don't you try me.

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.535
Remember who taught you
this stuff.

01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:50.886
I'll call 'em, alright?
I'll just, uh, I'll fix it.

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:54.803
You ungrateful fucking
cock-sucking nobody!

01:33:56.979 --> 01:33:59.024
- Roy...
- I made you.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.244
Don't you forget that.
I made you.

01:34:01.418 --> 01:34:02.941
I'm pretty sure
I made myself, okay.

01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:04.595
- Uh, no. You were a loser then,
- Hey, listen, listen...

01:34:04.769 --> 01:34:06.858
- and you're still a loser!
- Okay, Roy, listen,

01:34:07.032 --> 01:34:08.381
I'm running a business
here, okay?

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:10.079
Guests complained about
Russell's condition,

01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:11.994
which you lied about,
by the way, alright?

01:34:12.168 --> 01:34:13.299
So that's what happened.

01:34:14.736 --> 01:34:15.737
It's not my fault.

01:34:17.956 --> 01:34:19.697
What are you, what are you
trying to say?

01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:22.308
I hear he's sick. Really sick.

01:34:22.482 --> 01:34:23.919
Yeah, he's got pneumonia.

01:34:24.093 --> 01:34:25.442
- He's got pneumonia?
- That's right.

01:34:25.616 --> 01:34:26.965
Is that the name for it
now on the street?

01:34:27.139 --> 01:34:28.575
Watch out. Maybe you'll get it.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:30.229
You know, you don't want that.

01:34:30.577 --> 01:34:31.840
[melancholic music]

01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:33.450
What, are you scared of me?

01:34:33.798 --> 01:34:35.017
No, just...

01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:36.453
- Little cold out, you know.
- Huh.

01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:44.896
Good to see that you have, uh,

01:34:45.767 --> 01:34:49.292
lost the last traces of, uh,
decency you once had.

01:34:49.858 --> 01:34:52.425
Well, I learned from the best,
Roy, what can I say?

01:34:52.599 --> 01:34:53.688
I love you too.

01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:00.869
[slap]

01:35:02.827 --> 01:35:04.394
You've got some feelings
now suddenly?

01:35:04.568 --> 01:35:05.830
You're the fucking devil!

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:07.614
I don't recognise you anymore, okay?

01:35:07.789 --> 01:35:09.138
You're the fucking devil!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:35:09.312 --> 01:35:11.140
- You scare me.
- You fucking old man!

01:35:11.314 --> 01:35:12.141
You're no saint.

01:35:12.315 --> 01:35:13.359
You're not God.

01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:18.713
Why don't you go save him?

01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:20.976
Save him over there.

01:35:22.499 --> 01:35:23.848
Don't get sick, Roy!

01:35:24.414 --> 01:35:25.676
[melancholic music]

01:35:41.126 --> 01:35:44.739
- Dad! There's the big man.
- Oh!

01:35:44.913 --> 01:35:46.479
- Look at this guy, huh?
- Ah, hey, how are you?

01:35:46.653 --> 01:35:47.785
- He looks great.
- Look at this guy!

01:35:47.959 --> 01:35:49.352
You look good, Dad.
You look great.

01:35:49.526 --> 01:35:51.528
- Ah, good.
- This is Erwin.

01:35:51.702 --> 01:35:54.096
This man's got 195 IQ, alright?

01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:56.098
The best. Erwin, where'd you
go to school?

01:35:56.272 --> 01:35:57.795
- Columbia.
- Oh boy.

01:35:57.969 --> 01:35:59.797
- He's a New Yorker!
- You're a smarty pants, huh?

01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:02.278
- He's my new Roy Cohn.
- Oh.

01:36:02.452 --> 01:36:04.236
Alright. Go ahead.
And listen, Dad,

01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:06.369
I bought some land under
the Empire State Building.

01:36:06.543 --> 01:36:08.588
- Oh boy.
- Erwin, you love the Empire

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:10.068
State Building, right?
- The best building.

01:36:10.242 --> 01:36:12.027
How many units can you put
in there?

01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:14.594
Don't worry about it.
Listen, take a look at that.

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:16.161
Erwin's got a couple of things
to say.

01:36:16.335 --> 01:36:17.597
- Okay.
- Yeah, Mr Trump, my office

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.948
had a request
relating to the trust.

01:36:20.122 --> 01:36:22.994
This will allow us to avail
ourselves of some

01:36:23.168 --> 01:36:25.954
new tax breaks and reduce
the overall, uh,

01:36:26.128 --> 01:36:27.825
taxation on the trust.
- Okay, the trust.

01:36:27.999 --> 01:36:30.567
So, with your signature here,
we'll be putting Donald in

01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:33.439
as the trustee for the trust.
And that will allow you

01:36:33.613 --> 01:36:35.615
to not have to worry yourself.
- Save you a lot of taxes, Dad.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.052
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

01:36:37.226 --> 01:36:38.575
- For the trust.
- That's right.

01:36:38.749 --> 01:36:41.099
- And you want me to sign here?
- Yes I do.

01:36:41.273 --> 01:36:43.536
- Oh really?
- Mom, what are you doing?

01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.843
We don't have time.
I gotta get back into the city.

01:36:46.017 --> 01:36:47.584
Listen Mom, we don't have time.
Dad, go ahead.

01:36:47.758 --> 01:36:49.151
- Is that the tea?
- Please sign right there.

01:36:49.325 --> 01:36:51.109
- This is for the...
- Donald, what is this?

01:36:51.283 --> 01:36:52.676
- This is for the trust, Mary.
- Oh. Well, let me take a look.

01:36:52.850 --> 01:36:54.939
- For the, um...
- It's just a formality.

01:36:55.113 --> 01:36:57.768
- But who are you?
- This is, this is my attorney.

01:36:58.377 --> 01:37:01.685
- This is your siblings' trust.
- I understand, but listen...

01:37:01.859 --> 01:37:03.818
You're jeopardising your,
your siblings' trust.

01:37:03.992 --> 01:37:05.471
No, I'm not jeopardising
anything.

01:37:05.645 --> 01:37:08.083
I have some loans, they need
to be guaranteed.

01:37:08.257 --> 01:37:10.912
I gotta just get these Taiwan
bankers off my back.

01:37:11.086 --> 01:37:12.391
- What...
- Okay?

01:37:12.565 --> 01:37:14.219
I just need to show the bankers
that I'm good.

01:37:14.872 --> 01:37:17.266
Your father
is a little confused.

01:37:17.788 --> 01:37:21.487
He's not the right person
to be signing this document.

01:37:21.748 --> 01:37:23.533
That's why we should have,

01:37:23.794 --> 01:37:25.056
as you should know
as a lawyer...

01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:26.928
- Mom.
- Sound mind deciding...

01:37:27.102 --> 01:37:28.712
Who's gonna look after
this family, okay?

01:37:28.886 --> 01:37:30.845
Who's gonna look after
this family when he,

01:37:31.019 --> 01:37:33.021
when he can't fucking spell
his name?

01:37:33.499 --> 01:37:36.894
- Language! Donald...
- Let's go Erwin, come on.

01:37:37.068 --> 01:37:38.940
- Mom, you don't understand.
- What is the rush?

01:37:39.592 --> 01:37:41.029
I'm looking out
for the family, alright?

01:37:41.203 --> 01:37:42.726
- Language, Donald.
- I'm looking out for the family.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.771
I'm pretty much sure that nobody
else is doing that.

01:37:44.946 --> 01:37:47.557
Not Elizabeth, not Mary,
not fucking Freddy...

01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:51.648
No! You do not speak his name!

01:37:51.822 --> 01:37:53.911
You have no right!

01:37:54.085 --> 01:37:55.391
It's time for you to go.

01:37:56.696 --> 01:37:58.307
[melancholic music]

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.142
[background TV]

01:38:15.063 --> 01:38:16.891
[dramatic music]

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:29.816
Okay, you need to stop
consuming these immediately.

01:38:29.991 --> 01:38:31.253
I thought they were
like vitamins.

01:38:31.427 --> 01:38:33.429
It's amphetamines.
It's cheap speed.

01:38:33.603 --> 01:38:35.561
Erectile dysfunction's one
of the many side-effects.

01:38:35.735 --> 01:38:37.607
I don't have that problem,
but, you know, I eat.

01:38:37.781 --> 01:38:39.435
I mean, we all like to eat,
doc, right?

01:38:39.609 --> 01:38:41.045
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, did you see this?

01:38:41.219 --> 01:38:43.047
Are you seeing this?
It keeps growing.

01:38:43.221 --> 01:38:45.136
Everything is growing, and I'm
not talking about my hair.

01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:46.442
Well, have you tried exercise?

01:38:46.616 --> 01:38:47.965
- No, no, absolutely not.
- Why not?

01:38:48.139 --> 01:38:49.445
You know that's gonna kill you,
right, doc?

01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:51.926
First of all, the body
is like a battery.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.623
It has finite energy,
it runs out.

01:38:53.797 --> 01:38:56.843
- Okay. That's not true.
- That is totally the truth.

01:38:57.018 --> 01:38:58.497
- Totally the truth.
- Okay. Donald...

01:38:58.671 --> 01:39:00.717
And the problem that
I'm having is, I'm just...

01:39:00.891 --> 01:39:02.980
I, I need to stop growing,
that's all.

01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:06.418
Okay. We have surgical options.

01:39:06.592 --> 01:39:08.768
- That sounds great.
- Okay, yeah.

01:39:09.421 --> 01:39:13.164
So, with an incision
here, here and here...

01:39:13.338 --> 01:39:15.906
we're gonna get rid of the, uh,
the ab fat

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.821
and we're gonna get
the love handles gone too.

01:39:17.995 --> 01:39:19.214
Oh, I hate the love handles.

01:39:19.388 --> 01:39:20.519
What about my hair?

01:39:21.216 --> 01:39:24.871
Okay, you've got some male
pattern baldness. Um...

01:39:25.046 --> 01:39:27.613
- And that's normal, right?
- It is, absolutely, okay?

01:39:27.787 --> 01:39:29.006
But it doesn't have to be,

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:29.876
you know?
- Okay.

01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:30.877
You'll talk to our

01:39:31.052 --> 01:39:32.053
in-house specialist.

01:39:32.227 --> 01:39:33.706
About a scalp reduction?

01:39:34.533 --> 01:39:35.882
We''re gonna cover
that up easily.

01:39:36.057 --> 01:39:37.362
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:39:37.536 --> 01:39:38.755
Getting old sucks.
Do you know what I mean?

01:39:38.929 --> 01:39:40.061
- Yes.
- Do you ever feel that way?

01:39:40.235 --> 01:39:42.063
Well, a lot of my patients do.

01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:43.368
One more question.

01:39:45.414 --> 01:39:46.850
What do you think about AIDS?

01:39:47.546 --> 01:39:49.200
- What do...
- What do you think about AIDS?

01:39:49.374 --> 01:39:51.376
- What do I think about it?
- Yeah. How do people get it?

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:53.291
'Cause it's not just
homosexuals, doc.

01:39:53.465 --> 01:39:54.466
- Right.
- You know?

01:39:55.076 --> 01:39:58.253
The research indicates
HIV, uh, spreads

01:39:58.427 --> 01:40:00.690
through the exchange of blood
or semen.

01:40:00.864 --> 01:40:02.779
- Semen, yeah.
- Yes.

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:04.476
Well, and what if they
touch you?

01:40:04.781 --> 01:40:06.217
What if somebody touches you...
- That's okay.

01:40:06.391 --> 01:40:07.566
- Or if they breathe on you?
- They can,

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:08.959
they can breathe on you.

01:40:09.177 --> 01:40:10.221
That's okay.

01:40:11.396 --> 01:40:12.354
Okay.

01:40:13.137 --> 01:40:15.270
The legal establishment
in the state of New York

01:40:15.444 --> 01:40:18.751
wants to take away Roy Cohn's
licence to practice law.

01:40:19.143 --> 01:40:21.798
<i>They say he's dishonest.
They want to disbar him</i>

01:40:21.972 --> 01:40:25.106
<i>for allegedly playing fast
and loose with clients' money.</i>

01:40:26.194 --> 01:40:27.282
<i>How are you, Roy?</i>

01:40:27.717 --> 01:40:30.372
I'm terrific, uh, Mike.
It''s great to see you.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.200
This is what
the disciplinary committee

01:40:32.374 --> 01:40:34.202
of the bar says about you.

01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:37.118
<i>A total lack of moral character
and professional fitness,</i>

01:40:37.292 --> 01:40:39.163
<i>and a cruel public use
of your illness.</i>

01:40:39.337 --> 01:40:43.124
That's a pack of lies, because
I've never used my illness, uh,

01:40:43.298 --> 01:40:44.864
<i>to plead for anything.</i>

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:47.432
<i>I've called them a bunch
of yoyos, and, uh,</i>

01:40:47.606 --> 01:40:49.869
<i>that's what they are, Mike.
They're a bunch of yoyos.</i>

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:53.003
<i>Mm-hmm. When I tell friends
that I'm going to</i>

01:40:53.177 --> 01:40:54.657
<i>do a profile on you,</i>

01:40:54.874 --> 01:40:57.486
<i>the question on everyone's
mind is that,</i>

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:59.531
<i>and I'm sure you know
what I'm going to say,</i>

01:41:00.358 --> 01:41:02.317
<i>do you have AIDS?</i>

01:41:02.491 --> 01:41:05.015
Oh. No. I mean, that's easy.

01:41:05.929 --> 01:41:09.498
I have liver cancer, uh,
which, uh,

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:14.459
<i>they found moves
in strange directions,</i>

01:41:14.633 --> 01:41:15.852
<i>uh, but that...</i>

01:41:16.026 --> 01:41:18.855
categorically I do not
have AIDS.

01:41:19.029 --> 01:41:22.163
I'm sure you know why people ask
about AIDS, Roy Cohn,

01:41:22.772 --> 01:41:24.904
because they believe
you're a homosexual.

01:41:28.169 --> 01:41:29.735
Well, uh, that's a lie.

01:41:30.736 --> 01:41:34.218
<i>Every facet of my personality,
my, uh,</i>

01:41:34.392 --> 01:41:37.482
aggressiveness, my toughness,
and, uh,

01:41:37.656 --> 01:41:39.789
everything along those lines,
is just

01:41:39.963 --> 01:41:42.270
<i>totally, uh, incompatible...</i>

Hello, it's Roy.

01:42:15.564 --> 01:42:17.522
<i>Roy, it's Donald. How are you?</i>

01:42:20.569 --> 01:42:21.570
Donald.

01:42:22.005 --> 01:42:23.224
<i>How are you?</i>

01:42:23.659 --> 01:42:25.095

uh, Mike Wallace.</i>

01:42:32.494 --> 01:42:34.713
Right. Well, how'd I do?

01:42:35.758 --> 01:42:36.889
<i>You owned it.</i>

<i>Did I look, uh,</i>

01:42:41.851 --> 01:42:42.939
did I look weak?

01:42:43.113 --> 01:42:44.593
<i>Well, listen,</i>

01:42:44.941 --> 01:42:46.464
he's an asshole, you know?

01:42:46.638 --> 01:42:48.466
Frankly, he asked
nasty questions.

01:42:49.424 --> 01:42:50.381
How's Russell?

01:42:51.817 --> 01:42:53.950
Oh, uh, Russell died.

01:42:54.733 --> 01:42:56.561

everyone's crawling up my ass
about the debt.

<i>Don't even get me started about
Ivana. I mean, she's a bitch.</i>

01:43:23.849 --> 01:43:25.634
So, you thought, uh...

01:43:26.722 --> 01:43:31.248
give old Roy a call and ask
for some free legal advice?

01:43:32.075 --> 01:43:35.209
I mean, is there anyone better?
Come on.

01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:42.477
<i>I miss you, Roy.</i>

- Yeah?
<i>- Let's get you to the ocean.</i>

How do you feel, though?
You feel alright, no?

01:44:11.462 --> 01:44:14.465
Oh, sure, I, I feel
like a million bucks.

01:44:14.639 --> 01:44:16.119
'Cause you don't look that bad.

You know, if I have my way,
I'll be as thin as you.

You know, they, they suck
the fat from under your skin.

And also, don't tell anybody,
but...

01:44:30.394 --> 01:44:32.135
Might get 'em to remove
my bald patch.

You, uh, you look like the fella

What, uh, what happened
to your leg?

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.442
I didn't pay 'em on time,

this into Camelot.

Everyone, I just, uh,
I just wanna say a few words.

01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:55.496
Tonight we're celebrating
a really great guy, Roy Cohn.

01:46:57.019 --> 01:47:01.458
Roy's tough. Some say vicious,
even scary.

01:47:01.632 --> 01:47:03.547
I mean, look at him.

01:47:04.243 --> 01:47:06.245
That's not exactly a face you
wanna bring home to your mother,

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:08.160
am I right?
[laughter]

01:47:08.334 --> 01:47:12.164
But, um, you know, with Roy
it's about friendship, right?

01:47:12.338 --> 01:47:14.732
He has to like you,
and if he doesn't, forget it.

01:47:15.037 --> 01:47:18.432
He has to like you, right?
Thank God he liked me.

01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:20.782
And, I mean, I don't know,
I mean, he must've thought

01:47:20.956 --> 01:47:23.524
I was a baby or something,
'cause, you know, I don't drink,

01:47:23.698 --> 01:47:25.743
I don't smoke,
I don't take drugs.

01:47:25.917 --> 01:47:27.702
I have other problems which
I don't wanna tell you about,

01:47:27.876 --> 01:47:29.051
but, uh...
[group laughs]

01:47:29.225 --> 01:47:31.096
for whatever reason,
he liked me.

01:47:32.663 --> 01:47:36.667
But the truth is, as, uh,
tough as Roy is,

01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:38.190
and he is brutal,

01:47:38.626 --> 01:47:41.977
he, uh, truly is a loyal guy.

01:47:45.459 --> 01:47:46.938
It's a matter of honour
with him.

01:47:48.026 --> 01:47:50.986
And, um, frankly he's a hero.

01:47:52.901 --> 01:47:54.293
Happy birthday, Roy.

I know you're gonna go on
to do, uh, a lot of things

01:48:39.295 --> 01:48:41.645
that would make me, uh,
very proud.

01:48:51.046 --> 01:48:53.396
- Thank you.
- Well, it's not over yet, Roy.

01:48:54.179 --> 01:48:56.399
What? My life? [laughs]

01:48:56.573 --> 01:48:58.357
Let's hope not.
Maybe not tonight.

01:48:58.532 --> 01:49:00.621
Stay alive for
a little longer, Roy.

[door opens]

01:51:58.407 --> 01:52:00.931
There he is, huh? The greatest
writer of all time.

01:52:01.105 --> 01:52:02.193
- How you doing?
- Sorry Tony,

01:52:02.367 --> 01:52:03.586
I was with a contractor.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.675
- It's all good.
- Well, here we go.

01:52:05.849 --> 01:52:07.808
- [laughs] Here we are.
- Where do you wanna start?

01:52:07.982 --> 01:52:09.679
Let's see if this is gonna be
a negative book.

01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:12.769
Well, honestly I'm amazed that
you asked me to write this book,

01:52:12.943 --> 01:52:14.815
Mr Trump, considering
the article I wrote on you

01:52:14.989 --> 01:52:16.381
wasn't exactly flattering.
- Yeah, well,

01:52:16.555 --> 01:52:17.992
you put me on the cover
of New York Magazine,

01:52:18.166 --> 01:52:19.907
and you can write.
That's the most important thing.

01:52:20.081 --> 01:52:21.647
Now you just have to be nice
to me because I'm paying you.

01:52:22.518 --> 01:52:23.562
Sure you are.

01:52:24.259 --> 01:52:26.740
So, I was looking through some
of your interviews,

01:52:26.914 --> 01:52:30.221
and I'm finding it hard
to settle on a grand narrative

01:52:30.395 --> 01:52:32.876
for the book.
Yes, you like making deals...

01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:34.704
Well, I'm gonna stop you right
there, Tony.

01:52:34.878 --> 01:52:38.752
I don't, I don't like making
deals. Do you understand?

01:52:38.926 --> 01:52:41.885
I love making deals.
I love making deals.

01:52:42.059 --> 01:52:43.234
The bigger the better.

01:52:43.408 --> 01:52:45.062
- But to what end?
- To what end?

01:52:45.236 --> 01:52:47.369
Deals are the end. I mean,
that's like asking Da Vinci

01:52:47.543 --> 01:52:49.284
why he, why he painted
the Mona Lisa.

01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.634
You consider yourself an artist?

01:52:51.808 --> 01:52:53.636
Well, I am an artist, Tony,
and deals are my art form.

01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:55.333
Look, making deals
is an art form,

01:52:55.507 --> 01:52:56.770
and I wanna put this
in the book.

01:52:56.944 --> 01:52:58.423
It's something that
you're born with.

01:52:58.597 --> 01:52:59.860
You either have it
or you don't have it, okay?

01:53:00.034 --> 01:53:01.731
And if you don't have it,
don't do deals.

01:53:01.905 --> 01:53:03.864
Just get a beautiful job,
have a nice family and relax.

01:53:05.822 --> 01:53:07.345
The Art of the Deal.

01:53:07.519 --> 01:53:08.651
That sounds good.

01:53:09.608 --> 01:53:10.871
You know, I like that. That's...

01:53:11.045 --> 01:53:12.394
I think people will buy
into that.

01:53:12.568 --> 01:53:14.352
Well, let's see, Tony.
I'd buy that book.

01:53:14.526 --> 01:53:16.964
[laughs] Okay, let's go back
to your childhood.

01:53:17.268 --> 01:53:19.096
Uh, living in Queens,
what was that like?

01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:20.141
Well, I had a great childhood.

01:53:20.315 --> 01:53:21.664
Very normal, uh,

01:53:21.838 --> 01:53:23.187
wonderful parents,
supportive parents.

01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:24.885
And, you know, my dad was tough,

01:53:25.059 --> 01:53:27.191
and, uh, he helped me develop
a killer instinct.

01:53:28.236 --> 01:53:29.019
And?

01:53:29.193 --> 01:53:30.586
And, uh, yeah, frankly,

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.327
you know, I don't,
I don't wanna,

01:53:32.501 --> 01:53:34.024
I don't like to talk too much
about the past, Tony.

01:53:34.198 --> 01:53:36.157
You dwell on the past,
you go right down the tubes.

01:53:36.374 --> 01:53:38.115
This is just to give the reader
some context.

01:53:38.289 --> 01:53:39.160
Tony...

01:53:41.336 --> 01:53:43.381
Don't, don't, don't come here
busting my balls

01:53:43.555 --> 01:53:46.167
looking for some deep shit, alright?

01:53:46.341 --> 01:53:48.038
I hate when everybody tries
to dig around your life

01:53:48.212 --> 01:53:49.213
looking for some deep shit.

01:53:49.387 --> 01:53:50.780
We're all animals.

01:53:51.128 --> 01:53:52.564
Everybody wants to get rich
and have other people

01:53:52.738 --> 01:53:54.828
suck their cock.
Everybody wants to win, Tony.

01:53:55.002 --> 01:53:56.046
And that's the truth of it.

01:53:57.047 --> 01:53:59.615
- But that won't read well.
- Well, that's the truth of it.

01:53:59.789 --> 01:54:01.747
But it's not the truth
we're looking for right now.

01:54:01.922 --> 01:54:03.184
Right now people need to think

01:54:03.358 --> 01:54:04.838
there's some sort
of special sauce.

01:54:05.012 --> 01:54:06.752
Principles, a set of rules
that make you different.

01:54:06.927 --> 01:54:08.319
Well, that's easy,
'cause I have my rules.

01:54:08.493 --> 01:54:09.886
I got three rules, okay?

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.322
They're my three rules
of winning.

01:54:11.714 --> 01:54:15.022
Rule one, the world is a mess, okay?

01:54:15.196 --> 01:54:16.893
The world is a mess, Tony.

01:54:17.894 --> 01:54:20.418
You have to fight back,
you have to have a tough skin.

01:54:20.592 --> 01:54:22.290
Attack, attack, attack.

01:54:22.464 --> 01:54:25.119
If somebody comes after you
with a knife,

01:54:25.641 --> 01:54:28.426
you shoot 'em back
with a bazooka, okay?

01:54:28.644 --> 01:54:31.212
Rule two, what is truth, Tony?

01:54:31.386 --> 01:54:32.517
What is truth?

01:54:32.996 --> 01:54:35.303
You know what's truth?
What you say is truth,

01:54:35.477 --> 01:54:37.696
what I say is truth,
what he says is truth.

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:41.178
What is the truth in life?
Deny everything, admit nothing.

01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:43.354
You know what's true?
What I say is true.

01:54:43.528 --> 01:54:45.704
And third of all,
and most important,

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:48.794
no matter how fucked you are,

01:54:49.099 --> 01:54:52.276
you never, ever, ever
admit defeat.

01:54:52.450 --> 01:54:53.712
You always claim victory.

01:54:54.844 --> 01:54:55.758
Always.

01:54:56.890 --> 01:54:58.674
You know, that sounds
like the US foreign policy

01:54:58.848 --> 01:55:00.676
for the past quarter century.

01:55:00.850 --> 01:55:03.244
Well, unlike that,
this actually works.

01:55:04.985 --> 01:55:06.769
And I won a lot, Tony.
I won a lot.

01:55:06.943 --> 01:55:07.944
And even when they said
I didn't,

01:55:08.118 --> 01:55:09.032
I still turned it into a win,

01:55:09.206 --> 01:55:10.294
and that was the difference.

01:55:11.121 --> 01:55:13.645
So, how'd you come by
these set of rules?

01:55:15.604 --> 01:55:17.954
Well, I have an instinct, Tony.
I have a killer instinct.

01:55:18.781 --> 01:55:20.087
I always have.

01:55:20.261 --> 01:55:21.218
[sniffs]

01:55:23.003 --> 01:55:26.354
Listen, Tony, you have to have
a natural ability.

01:55:26.702 --> 01:55:28.443
I'm a big believer
in natural ability,

01:55:28.617 --> 01:55:30.575
and a lot of that is genetics.
You have to be born with it,

01:55:30.749 --> 01:55:33.013
you know, and some people
aren't and some people are,

01:55:33.187 --> 01:55:34.405
and that's the difference.

01:55:37.887 --> 01:55:38.888
You have to have it.

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.673
[dramatic music]
