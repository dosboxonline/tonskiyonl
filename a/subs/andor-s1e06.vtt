to something real?

00:05.375 --> 00:07.208
What would we be stealing?

00:07.291 --> 00:10.916
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.625
That's why you're here? Revenge?

00:15.708 --> 00:17.583
Yeah, that's good enough for now.

00:17.666 --> 00:19.500
I didn't mark you for a team player.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.333

01:01.416 --> 01:03.000
You can't live with that?

01:03.083 --> 01:05.791
I don't wanna walk in

01:07.833 --> 01:09.208

01:09.291 --> 01:11.083
I've had plenty of time to study,

01:11.166 --> 01:13.291

sneaking up here for months.

01:19.916 --> 01:21.291
I wasn't careful.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.416
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.791
Or it'll just be starting.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.291
I couldn't sleep.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.500
CASSIAN: It's natural.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.000
I need to be at my best.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.250
Don't worry.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.791
The excitement will kick in.

03:04.583 --> 03:07.166
I'm struggling to understand
why my faith doesn't calm me.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.250
I believe in something.
Why am I so unsettled?

03:09.333 --> 03:12.166
I mean, you have nothing,
you sleep like a stone.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.625
I write when I can't sleep.

03:15.541 --> 03:18.958
Wrote about you last night.
Not you specifically, not "Clem."

03:19.041 --> 03:22.041
Although I'm assuming
that's not your real name, anyway.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.333
"The Role of Mercenaries
in The Galactic Struggle for Freedom."

03:25.416 --> 03:27.291
My conclusion is simple.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.541
Weapons are tools.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.291
Those that use them are, by extension,

03:30.375 --> 03:32.583
assets that we must use
to our best advantage.

03:32.666 --> 03:34.166
The Empire has no moral boundaries,

03:34.250 --> 03:36.875
why should we not take hold
of every chance we can?

03:36.958 --> 03:39.458
Let them see how an insurgency adapts.

03:40.708 --> 03:44.041
(SIGHS) Well, you're half right.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.958
The Empire doesn't play by the rules.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.458
And how am I wrong?

03:50.416 --> 03:51.416
(SIGHS)

03:53.458 --> 03:55.375
They don't care enough to learn.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.250
They don't have to.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.958
You mean nothing to them.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.416
Perhaps they'll think
differently tomorrow.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.500
Be careful what you wish for.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.458
So you think it's hopeless, do you?

04:11.291 --> 04:14.166
Freedom? Independence? Justice?

04:15.083 --> 04:17.041
We should just submit and be thankful?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.375
Just take what we're given?

04:19.375 --> 04:20.458
(INHALES DEEPLY)

04:20.541 --> 04:22.583

(SMACKS LIPS) No.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.375

No matter what the reason.

Don't worry.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.041
You'll be fine.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.791
The Dhanis, they're a simple people.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.625
They breed a sad combination of traits

04:51.708 --> 04:54.291

to manipulation.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.250
<i>On a practical level,</i>

04:57.333 --> 05:00.375

05:01.541 --> 05:05.875
We've found the best way to steer them
as we'd like is to offer alternatives.

05:05.958 --> 05:10.375
You put a number of options on the table,
and they're so wrapped up in choosing,

05:10.458 --> 05:12.875
they fail to notice
you've given them nothing

05:12.958 --> 05:14.625
they thought they wanted at the start.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.625
<i>Their deeper problem is pride.</i>

05:18.708 --> 05:22.750

05:22.833 --> 05:24.583

05:24.666 --> 05:27.000

but then, along the way,
we've placed a series of "Comfort Units,"

05:37.541 --> 05:41.625
shelters and taverns
with cheap local beverages.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.208
Quite predictably,

05:43.291 --> 05:48.750
what began as 500 pilgrims at the bottom
has already dwindled down to...

05:48.833 --> 05:51.875
-Where are we now, Lieutenant?
-We counted 60 last night, sir.

05:51.958 --> 05:54.375
They may pick up
some highland stragglers along the way,

05:54.458 --> 05:56.083
but it's developing as we'd expected.

05:56.166 --> 05:59.875
Not that long ago,
they'd put 15,000 out there.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.791
Have they any idea this is the last time
they'll be allowed up here?

06:03.875 --> 06:05.583
No, there's no profit in that.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.083
We've spent the last decade promoting
an Imperial viewing festival

06:09.166 --> 06:10.583
down in the Enterprise Zone.

06:10.666 --> 06:12.250
They'll have that going forward.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.375
It is their sacred valley, is it not?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.041
Well, ultimately, they will return,
won't they, Colonel?

06:25.416 --> 06:27.083
Yes, sir. Seven years.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.875
Will the Dhanis let us build
our new facility in peace?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.541

Now, what do you make of him?

07:03.625 --> 07:04.666
Colonel Petigar?

07:05.875 --> 07:08.250
He's an engineer. You won't charm him.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.041
Well, it won't be for lack of trying.
