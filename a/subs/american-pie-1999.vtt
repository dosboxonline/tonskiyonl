WEBVTT

00:29.655 --> 00:31.490
Ohh,
you're so good.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.785
Ohh, yes.
I am the best, baby.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.246
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh. Oh, that was a tit.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.706
That is a tit! Yes!

00:39.790 --> 00:41.750
Oh, you're so big!

00:41.792 --> 00:44.586
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that's right, baby.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.880
- Oh, doggie
wants to hide his bone.
- Yes!

00:46.922 --> 00:49.091
Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.260
Man, would you shut up!

00:51.343 --> 00:53.762
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.764
Yeah, yeah.
Sweet dreams. Good night, Mom.

00:55.848 --> 00:59.101
Kiss good night.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.396
- Something wrong
with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.107
- There's... There's this nature
show that I'm trying to watch.
- Take it off.

01:05.190 --> 01:09.069
- And the birds are
all scrambled and I can't even...
- Do me! Yes!

01:09.152 --> 01:12.155
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

01:12.197 --> 01:15.659
- The thing must be broken or I
sat on the remote or something.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.161
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.290
- Yeah?
- No! No, I think he's tried
to watch some illegal channels.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.334
- Illegal... Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.420
- Oh, spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

01:26.503 --> 01:30.299
- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here.
Just give me this, please...

01:30.382 --> 01:33.177
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...

01:33.260 --> 01:36.972
Okay, okay. Let's, uh... What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

01:37.055 --> 01:38.348
Yes!

01:38.390 --> 01:38.765
Yes!

01:49.568 --> 01:52.404
Illegal channels?
Shit!

01:52.446 --> 01:54.823
If there's any channel that
should be illegal, it's
that "all-woman's" channel.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.744
- Lifetime supply
of pantyhose or some shit.
- Yeah.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.163
Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

02:01.246 --> 02:04.208
- No.
- Ariel, man. She's so hot!

02:04.291 --> 02:08.252
- She's a mermaid, dude.
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.

02:09.086 --> 02:12.883
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.720
Why? All that
happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.722
Yeah.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.724
Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.061
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.313
If you think so,
just open it.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.357
Fine.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.992
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

02:39.034 --> 02:42.579
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."

02:42.663 --> 02:44.623
Shut up!

02:44.706 --> 02:49.545
- You got in.
- Yes! I love you!

02:49.628 --> 02:52.130
Okay.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.223
Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.809
You've worn that shirt for,
like, three days in a row, man!

03:03.892 --> 03:05.894
Guys.
She said it.

03:05.978 --> 03:08.355
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.691
- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!

03:10.774 --> 03:13.151
Cornell's not
that far from "U" of "M."

03:13.235 --> 03:15.153
Yeah, it's only,
like, seven hours.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.197
Oh, and you get
to drive across Canada.

03:17.239 --> 03:21.743
- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.496
Wh-What we should
do today, in band.

03:24.580 --> 03:28.417
Instead of playing
our instruments regularly,
we should play them backwards.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.752
- That'll be so funny!
- Yeah.

03:35.048 --> 03:39.469
No offense, but you're talking
about a post-high school,
long-distance relationship.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.555
And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.724
That's not why
we're going out.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.311
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.563
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.732
It's got to be
completely perfect.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.860
I want the right time, the right moment,
the right place...

03:54.943 --> 03:57.696
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.994
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.120
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

04:05.162 --> 04:06.163
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.625
- Same ol'...
- Finch.
You got the Latin homework?

04:09.708 --> 04:15.380
Oh.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.966
It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.

04:18.050 --> 04:22.387
- It's a Latin joke.
- Yeah, Latin. Just drink your coffee.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.723
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

04:24.806 --> 04:27.309
What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.353
'Nova!

04:29.436 --> 04:31.480
What's up, dude?

04:31.563 --> 04:33.732
You comin' to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.193
Uh, depends if my date
wants to stop by.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.404
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.782
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,

04:41.865 --> 04:44.743
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

04:44.785 --> 04:48.580
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.083
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.711
I'll look for you in the no-fucking
section.

04:58.257 --> 05:02.219
All right. I'm shooting for a
9:00 E.T.A. beer in hand by five after.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.513
Breath check.

05:06.098 --> 05:09.393
Thank you.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.652
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something up
your sleeve for tonight?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.572
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.657
I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.411
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.705
Now, do you think she would prefer...

05:31.540 --> 05:33.500
Laid-back Jim...

05:33.542 --> 05:36.253
or...

05:36.336 --> 05:39.131
Cool, hip Jim?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.216
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.678
What? Correct me if I'm wrong but
you're the one with the girlfriend...

05:44.720 --> 05:46.722
and you're still
stranded on third base.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.474
Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?

05:49.558 --> 05:52.102
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. Batboy.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.104
What are you talking about?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.940
Guys, uh...

05:57.024 --> 06:00.277
What exactly does
third base feel like?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.321
You wanna
take this one?

06:03.488 --> 06:07.910
- Like warm apple pie.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:07.951 --> 06:11.246
Apple pie, huh?

06:11.330 --> 06:14.041
McDonald's or homemade?

06:14.082 --> 06:17.711
Gentlemen,
destiny awaits.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.591
- # It's been one week
since you looked at me #

06:22.674 --> 06:24.593
# Cocked your head to the side
and said, I'm angry #

06:24.676 --> 06:27.346
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

06:27.346 --> 06:29.973
Yeah.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.184
Oops!

06:32.267 --> 06:35.103
- Holy!
- H-Hey!

06:35.145 --> 06:38.815
Nadia! Buenos dÃ­as.
Glad you could make it.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.818
I'll be back for you later.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.035
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.162
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.457
- The keg's back there! Enjoy!
- Yeah.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.877
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.213
Haha, bitches!

07:01.296 --> 07:03.298
- Sherman!
- Hey!

07:03.340 --> 07:05.843
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

07:09.388 --> 07:10.764
Fellas!
What's goin' on?

07:10.806 --> 07:12.099
Fellas!
What's goin' on?

07:12.182 --> 07:15.602
Sherman. Not much. Just, uh,
scopin' the babes.

07:15.644 --> 07:19.273
Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.860
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.320
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

07:25.404 --> 07:28.740
- Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.
- Hey!

07:28.824 --> 07:30.951
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

07:31.034 --> 07:33.161
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.872
- Um, no.
- No.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.250
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.046
Fellas, it's time
she experienced... the Shermanator.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.424
Yeah, okay,
Sherman. Whatever.

07:45.507 --> 07:49.553
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

07:49.636 --> 07:53.140
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.643
- Go get 'em, tiger.
I'll be back!

07:58.854 --> 08:00.814
- Hopeless.
- Completely.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.941
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.903
Oh, shit.
Guys... Guys...

08:05.986 --> 08:09.615
There's Nadia and
she just looked at me.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.326
- She just looked at me.
- Well, why don't you go talk to her?

08:13.410 --> 08:15.954
Yeah.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.499
Yeah, you're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.544
Yeah,
I could do that. Sure.

08:22.628 --> 08:26.632
Sure.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.636
Kev? Kev? Ke...

08:39.102 --> 08:41.855
Yeah. Yeah.

08:43.232 --> 08:48.570
# At last #

08:51.073 --> 08:53.450
# My love #

08:53.534 --> 08:56.662
# Has come along #

08:59.122 --> 09:03.126
# My lonely days #

09:03.168 --> 09:07.381
- # Are over #
- That's great!

09:07.464 --> 09:11.760
# And life
is like a song #

09:15.681 --> 09:17.891
# Oh, yeah, yeah #

09:17.933 --> 09:20.185
# At last #

09:21.562 --> 09:23.522
See ya later.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.774
# The stars above ##

09:31.697 --> 09:34.074
We're here for the party.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.286
What party?
There's no party.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.580
Party!

09:41.498 --> 09:45.961
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.385
So, what's your major?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.554
Post-modern feminist thought.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.974
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

09:59.057 --> 10:02.227
Sure.

10:02.311 --> 10:07.691
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

10:07.774 --> 10:12.196
Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.573
Suck me, beautiful.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.159
What did you just say?

10:17.201 --> 10:20.954
Suck me, beautiful.

10:21.038 --> 10:26.210
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.587
That's pathetic.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.174
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.218
Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.595
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.889
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

10:38.972 --> 10:41.934
and spout off
cheeseball lines to be romantic.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.229
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

10:45.312 --> 10:49.441
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

10:49.525 --> 10:53.737
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

10:58.784 --> 11:03.288
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

11:03.372 --> 11:07.042
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.545
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.755
Damn, my parts fuckin' stink!

11:11.839 --> 11:15.717
Dude, you gotta take
a shit! You smell like a Yeti!

11:15.759 --> 11:18.595
Or not.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.431
Just relax.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.396
You actually
said that?

11:27.479 --> 11:30.607
Shut up!

11:30.691 --> 11:32.734
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.779
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.323
Hey, no problem,
'Nova.

11:38.407 --> 11:42.327
Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore.
I'm a... I'm a fraud.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.830
You guys
are pathetic.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.833
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.628
"Suck me, beautiful"!

11:56.592 --> 11:59.178
- Let me know.
- Okay.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.597
Keep going.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.183
I should be able
to talk to girls.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.602
I'm articulate.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.937
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. Verbal.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.231
Bullshit.
There's no way.

12:11.273 --> 12:15.194
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

12:15.277 --> 12:19.615
Copious. Verisimilitude.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.701
Oh, ohh. Now.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.088
Suck me,
beautiful!

12:35.130 --> 12:37.966
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

12:38.050 --> 12:43.347
- Please, vacate the room.
- You are such a jerk.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.979
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

12:51.063 --> 12:54.358
Yup.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.693
And you got
a keg too!

12:56.777 --> 12:59.613
- Wow!
- Indeed.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.746
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.249
No. No.
Here, babe!

13:10.332 --> 13:13.252
Thanks.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.380
You're really
beautiful. Oh...

13:16.463 --> 13:20.092
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.693
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

13:37.776 --> 13:42.531
- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight,

13:42.614 --> 13:45.492
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.954
No way!

13:49.037 --> 13:51.957
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

13:52.040 --> 13:56.670
Look. Sarah,

13:56.753 --> 14:00.716
I... I wouldn't go telling
stories or anything about you.

14:00.757 --> 14:05.387
I promise.
So, just... relax,

14:05.470 --> 14:09.683
take it slow... and
let the good times roll.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.397
- Okay.
- All right.

14:20.861 --> 14:24.114
What's wrong?

14:25.782 --> 14:28.368
What's wrong?
What is it?

14:31.079 --> 14:35.542
Xenophobic.

14:35.584 --> 14:40.005
Oh!

14:40.047 --> 14:42.966
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

14:44.176 --> 14:47.554
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

14:47.638 --> 14:50.182
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.434
I mean, h-have you just
never had one with Kevin...

14:52.518 --> 14:54.478
or have you never
had one, period?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.897
I've had one.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.191
- I think.
- Okay.

14:59.233 --> 15:03.111
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.113
You tell me you never
even had one manually?

15:05.197 --> 15:08.450
- I've never tried it.
- You've never
double-clicked your mouse?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.662
Ha-ha, nice!

15:11.703 --> 15:14.373
- Jesus! Stifler, how much
did you drink, man?

15:14.456 --> 15:18.418
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?

15:18.502 --> 15:22.256
- Fuck you!
- Ooh, whoo!

15:22.422 --> 15:26.426
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

15:26.510 --> 15:31.515
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.519
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

15:35.602 --> 15:39.773
- M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!

15:39.815 --> 15:41.900
Oh-ho, yeah!

15:41.984 --> 15:45.028
- Yeah! MILF! MILF!
- Hey, guys... Guys. Guys.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.448
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

15:48.490 --> 15:52.953
Yeah, uh... Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

15:53.036 --> 15:57.791
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

15:59.293 --> 16:01.879
She's hot!

16:04.214 --> 16:09.386
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

16:09.428 --> 16:14.516
Sherman?
The Shermanator?

16:14.558 --> 16:18.020
Come on, man.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.607
MILF! MILF!

16:21.690 --> 16:25.944
MILF! MILF! Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

16:26.028 --> 16:29.406
Oh, my God,
bro, dude.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.701
Enough of this blow job bullshit.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.455
- I gotta get laid already.
- That's nice.
Really, really nice.

16:36.538 --> 16:40.292
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.837
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

16:43.587 --> 16:47.925
Yeti!
I am the Yeti!

16:56.683 --> 16:59.269
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch.

16:59.353 --> 17:03.273
Where were you last night, huh?
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

17:03.315 --> 17:06.443
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

17:06.527 --> 17:09.363
So,
no ladies left.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.949
It was a very
special night, very special.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.617
Guys. Guys.

17:16.954 --> 17:20.958
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.462
- Thank you.
- Uhh.

17:25.546 --> 17:29.633
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.635
Bye.

17:33.846 --> 17:37.266
Fellas, say good-bye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.018
I... am now a man.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.771
I highly recommend
you join the club.

17:42.855 --> 17:48.193
We were doin' the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.

17:48.277 --> 17:51.363
I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?

17:51.446 --> 17:56.118
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.872
Best of luck
to you boys.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.335
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.130
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.675
No, we shouldn't be.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.678
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.389
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

18:17.472 --> 18:20.142
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.687
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

18:23.770 --> 18:27.441
You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

18:27.524 --> 18:29.943
I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.

18:30.027 --> 18:34.698
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.326
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.703
Er, nah. It's...
It's more than an agreement.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.914
- What? A bet?
- A pact.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.333
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

18:44.374 --> 18:48.212
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.716
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.552
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone there, right?

18:55.636 --> 18:58.180
Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.682
Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.435
I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.

19:03.519 --> 19:05.812
Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,

19:05.896 --> 19:08.023
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.025
Their tiger-style
kung fu is strong.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.027
But our dragon-style
will defeat it.

19:12.069 --> 19:15.614
- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East
and West must unite!

19:15.697 --> 19:18.242
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

19:18.325 --> 19:23.080
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.749
We must make
a stand, here and now.

19:27.084 --> 19:30.504
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

19:30.587 --> 19:34.675
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

19:34.758 --> 19:38.178
This is our day.
This is our time.

19:38.262 --> 19:42.599
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.643
- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.

19:44.726 --> 19:48.605
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

19:48.689 --> 19:51.233
- We will get laid!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:53.527 --> 19:57.489
Now, the sex: It's got
to be valid, consensual sex.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.951
- No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.495
Busted.

20:03.579 --> 20:06.290
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.458
- Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
- I know,

20:08.542 --> 20:10.669
but you gotta think
about it this way.

20:10.752 --> 20:14.631
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

20:14.673 --> 20:18.677
- Yeah-yeah, he's right. It's,
like tradition or something.
- The Rose Bowl.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.973
- So, that gives us...
- Exactly three weeks to the day.

20:24.766 --> 20:28.312
- We're gonna do this.
- All right, to the next step!
- Next step!

20:28.395 --> 20:28.937
Next step!

20:28.979 --> 20:30.814
Next step!

20:30.856 --> 20:35.861
# I have visions I was in them
I was lookin' into the mirror #

20:35.944 --> 20:38.864
# To see a little bit clearer #

20:38.947 --> 20:41.366
# The rottenness
and evil in me #

20:43.827 --> 20:48.332
# Fingertips have memories I can't
forget the curves of your body #

20:48.415 --> 20:51.543
# And when I feel
a bit naughty #

20:51.585 --> 20:54.796
# I run it up
the flagpole and see #

20:54.880 --> 20:57.132
# Who salutes
but no one ever does #

20:57.174 --> 21:00.093
# I'm not sick
but I'm not well #

21:00.093 --> 21:02.971
# I'm not sick
but I'm not well #

21:03.013 --> 21:06.475
# And I'm so hot #

21:06.558 --> 21:10.187
# 'Cause I'm in hell #

21:10.229 --> 21:14.525
# Been around the world and found
that only stupid people are breeding #

21:14.608 --> 21:18.403
# The cretins
cloning and feeding #

21:18.445 --> 21:21.156
- Well, did you get the flowers?
- # And I don't even own a TV #

21:22.950 --> 21:25.619
# Hear the voices in my head
I swear to God #

21:25.702 --> 21:28.664
# It sounds like
they're snoring #

21:28.705 --> 21:31.583
# But if you're poor
and you're boring #

21:31.625 --> 21:34.211
# The agony and the irony #

21:34.294 --> 21:38.006
# They're killing me #

21:38.048 --> 21:42.135
# I'm not sick
but I'm not well #

21:42.219 --> 21:45.472
# And I'm so hot #

21:45.556 --> 21:49.268
# 'Cause I'm in hell ##

21:49.309 --> 21:51.603
Don't worry. You'll
get her back soon enough.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.981
- You think so?
- Sure, she likes you.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.107
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.191
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

21:56.275 --> 22:00.195
Um, you know what?
You can't really ask me that.

22:00.279 --> 22:03.282
Well, if you want to get
her in the sack, I mean,
just tell her you love her.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.285
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica,

22:06.326 --> 22:08.453
I- I don't want
to dupe her.

22:08.537 --> 22:12.082
All right.
What you need to do...

22:12.166 --> 22:14.334
is learn how to press
a girl's buttons.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.336
You have to give her
what she's never had.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.798
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.927
Ohh, Kev! Uhh. Yeah.

22:23.969 --> 22:27.097
- Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

22:27.181 --> 22:29.391
- You got it, stud!
- Well, you know,

22:29.474 --> 22:31.602
I'm-I'm pretty sure that I've...
given her a...

22:31.685 --> 22:35.647
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time...

22:35.731 --> 22:39.193
- No.
- Oh, man.

22:39.276 --> 22:44.114
- Look, kid, it's up to you.
The big "L" or the big "O."
- Dickhead!

22:43.906 --> 22:47.242
- You gotta see this.
- # Do you believe in #

22:47.326 --> 22:50.329
- # Magic in a young girl's heart #
- # Ooh, ooh #

22:50.412 --> 22:53.957
# How the music can free her
whenever it starts #

22:54.041 --> 22:57.377
# And it's magic
if the music is groovy #

22:57.461 --> 23:01.048
- # It makes you feel happy #
- What did you cocks do to him?

23:01.131 --> 23:03.926
- # I'll tell you about the magic
It'll free your soul #
- # Ooh, ooh, ooh #

23:04.009 --> 23:08.347
# But it's like tryin' to tell
a stranger 'bout rock 'n' roll ##

23:08.472 --> 23:10.641
Great.
See you next time.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.357
- Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?
- Yeah.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.109
- I-I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.111
I think you need
your balls reattached.

23:23.153 --> 23:26.698
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

23:26.782 --> 23:28.826
This place
is an untapped resource.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.911
I mean,
check it out.

23:30.994 --> 23:35.582
- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining
jazz choir so late?

23:35.666 --> 23:39.378
- Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

23:39.461 --> 23:43.507
You guys,
we don't even know him.

23:45.509 --> 23:47.427
You dipshit!

23:47.511 --> 23:49.596
You're expecting
to score with some...

23:49.680 --> 23:51.598
goody-goody
choirgirl priss?

23:51.682 --> 23:55.811
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

23:55.894 --> 23:58.105
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

23:58.188 --> 24:01.233
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

24:01.316 --> 24:03.277
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.698
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

24:09.616 --> 24:12.870
Uh, just a second!

24:18.292 --> 24:20.419
Come in. Come in.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.546
Oh, Jim, you're here.

24:22.588 --> 24:26.550
Uh, I was just walking
by your room and uh...

24:26.633 --> 24:30.679
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

24:30.762 --> 24:33.140
a little
father-son, uh-uh, chat."

24:34.516 --> 24:38.604
Oh! I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.940
Do you just want to flip
to the center section?

24:44.234 --> 24:46.695
Well, this is the...
this is the, uh, female form.

24:46.778 --> 24:49.781
And they have
focused on the breasts,

24:49.865 --> 24:54.620
uh, which are used primarily
to, uh, feed young infants...

24:54.703 --> 24:59.374
- and, uh... and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.794
This is, uh...
This is Hustler.

25:02.878 --> 25:06.632
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

25:06.673 --> 25:11.512
Now, they have decided to focus
on the, uh, pubic region...

25:11.595 --> 25:15.432
- Right.
- The whole groin area.

25:15.516 --> 25:19.311
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

25:19.353 --> 25:22.439
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,

25:22.523 --> 25:26.401
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"

25:26.443 --> 25:30.280
- You see?
- Right.

25:30.322 --> 25:34.451
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,

25:34.493 --> 25:38.789
- but, again,
if you flip to the center...

25:38.831 --> 25:41.291
Section...

25:41.333 --> 25:45.671
Well, you see the detail that, uh,
that they go into in this picture here.

25:45.712 --> 25:49.383
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- It almost looks like
a tropical plant or something...

25:49.466 --> 25:51.385
- underwater... thing.
- Yeah. Yes.

25:51.468 --> 25:53.762
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.014
- Well, don't say, "Oh..."
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.225
Oh, you do. Oh, I see. Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.269
- You know everything...
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed...

26:00.310 --> 26:03.272
- I really don't need you
to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless...

26:03.355 --> 26:06.024
- You know what?
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
- No-no-no.

26:06.108 --> 26:09.528
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.613
I shouldn't
have got hot there.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.907
Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.909
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

26:15.993 --> 26:19.496
for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh...
at your leisure.

26:20.372 --> 26:23.542
Wait!

26:27.337 --> 26:29.506
Well, safer
than a tube sock.

26:31.592 --> 26:35.554
- Okay, that... That was good.
- Yeah.

26:37.097 --> 26:41.059
- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

26:40.434 --> 26:43.145
So, Finch,
this is your plan?

26:43.187 --> 26:46.648
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.775
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

26:48.817 --> 26:52.529
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in.

26:52.613 --> 26:55.616
- In the spirit of this
whole pact, you know?
- Sure, what do you need?

26:55.699 --> 26:58.952
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

26:58.994 --> 27:02.873
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.751
You know, Finch,
it's... it's senior year.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.170
I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?

27:08.253 --> 27:11.590
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

27:17.971 --> 27:20.724
Excuse me.

27:20.766 --> 27:23.268
Uh, that's
Paul Finch, right?

27:23.352 --> 27:26.104
- Yeah.
- Well, you've seen him
in the locker room, right?

27:26.188 --> 27:31.235
- Uh, yeah.
- So, my friends, they want
to know. Is it true?

27:31.318 --> 27:34.071
You know,
that he's... equipped.

27:34.154 --> 27:38.283
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.786
I mean, uh...

27:40.869 --> 27:44.164
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

27:44.206 --> 27:47.334
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

27:47.376 --> 27:49.461
All right. Thanks.

27:50.838 --> 27:53.173
Oh, man!

27:53.340 --> 27:58.428
So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.

27:58.512 --> 28:01.139
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin' to make her...

28:01.223 --> 28:05.644
- Orgasm?
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

28:05.727 --> 28:08.021
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

28:08.105 --> 28:11.900
- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that.
Listen, pay attention.

28:11.984 --> 28:15.237
Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

28:15.279 --> 28:18.574
No, it'd be good to be able
to, you know, return the favor.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.076
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

28:21.118 --> 28:24.413
See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.

28:24.454 --> 28:31.003
- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've
just inherited the Bible.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.547
It originally started
as a sex manual,

28:33.589 --> 28:37.009
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.720
And each year it got passed on to one
East student who was worthy.

28:39.761 --> 28:43.974
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

28:46.393 --> 28:51.648
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

28:51.690 --> 28:55.736
All right.
So now you know. Good luck.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.328
- # If you believe in magic #
- # Ooh, magic #

29:04.411 --> 29:09.583
# Don't you bother to choose if it's
jug band music or rhythm and blues #

29:09.666 --> 29:13.003
# Just go and listen
It will start with a smile #

29:13.086 --> 29:16.840
# That won't wipe off your face
no matter how hard you try #

29:16.924 --> 29:22.471
# Your feet start tappin' and you can't
seem to find how you got there #

29:22.554 --> 29:25.265
# Do you believe in magic ##

29:25.307 --> 29:30.312
# Scooby-dooby doo bah scoo-scooby-dooby
dooby-dooby doo bah #

29:30.395 --> 29:32.648
# Yeah, magic ##

29:32.731 --> 29:35.067
What was that?

29:35.108 --> 29:37.694
- Uh, sorry.
- No, it was good.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.575
Well, it, uh...
It came from the heart.

29:43.617 --> 29:47.579
Well, keep it coming.
All right, people, good work!

29:47.663 --> 29:50.332
Now, don't forget. The state
competition's a couple of weeks away,

29:50.374 --> 29:53.544
so keep on it, okay?

30:03.428 --> 30:06.098
Not bad, Chris.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.433
Really?

30:09.518 --> 30:11.854
Thanks, uh,
Heather, right?

30:11.937 --> 30:13.856
Yeah.

30:13.939 --> 30:16.441
So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

30:16.525 --> 30:21.196
Right. I feel like I've
discovered this whole new side of me.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.782
I mean, uh,
music is so expressive.

30:23.824 --> 30:27.494
Okay.
I mean, I agree, but...

30:27.578 --> 30:30.622
aren't you supposed to be out,
like, trying to decapitate someone...

30:30.706 --> 30:34.710
- with your lacrosse stick or something?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.879
You know, I know what
people think. It's like,

30:36.920 --> 30:40.007
"Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player."

30:40.090 --> 30:42.759
You know, I also play football,
by the way, but that's, like,

30:42.843 --> 30:46.263
- that's not all that I am, you know?
- Of course, I didn't...

30:46.305 --> 30:50.267
I mean, it really bothers me when
people try to pigeonhole me like that.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.311
You?

30:52.394 --> 30:55.230
You think
I don't get that?

30:55.314 --> 30:58.692
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

30:58.734 --> 31:03.030
that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."

31:03.071 --> 31:07.409
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

31:07.493 --> 31:10.829
Well,
the same things you do,

31:10.871 --> 31:13.874
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

31:13.916 --> 31:16.335
- Why? What do you think I do?
- Oh, I...

31:16.418 --> 31:19.421
I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.

31:19.505 --> 31:24.635
- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?

31:24.718 --> 31:27.596
You know,
stuff... about you.

31:30.098 --> 31:32.518
All right.

31:32.601 --> 31:37.105
Mom, I'm home!

32:33.245 --> 32:35.747
Oh, yeah. Oh!

32:39.001 --> 32:43.589
- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.347
Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, uh... that, uh...

32:53.265 --> 32:55.726
we ate it all.

33:34.806 --> 33:37.184
Goal by number eight, Chris Ostreicher.

33:41.146 --> 33:43.148
- Nice game.
- Nice game. Good game.

33:47.027 --> 33:49.988
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

33:50.030 --> 33:53.492
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

33:53.534 --> 33:56.119
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

33:56.161 --> 33:59.164
- Um, Chris...
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.

33:59.248 --> 34:01.625
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.836
- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.

34:03.919 --> 34:07.464
- Come on. I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

34:07.548 --> 34:11.176
Okay. Um.

34:11.260 --> 34:14.763
So, I had this thought and...

34:14.847 --> 34:17.099
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

34:17.181 --> 34:21.770
I don't know if you can,
but since I'm not going with
anybody, I thought that maybe...

34:21.853 --> 34:24.523
Those guys sucked ass!

34:24.565 --> 34:26.775
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

34:26.859 --> 34:31.655
Well, uh, I was
asking Chris to prom.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.699
So, do you
want to go?

34:33.782 --> 34:37.244
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

34:37.327 --> 34:40.581
Well, just don't
expect Oz to pay for the limo!

34:40.664 --> 34:43.708
Stifler, fuck!
I mean...

34:43.792 --> 34:48.297
Why do you got to be so
insensitive all the time?

34:48.338 --> 34:51.675
What?

34:51.757 --> 34:55.137
Whatever. Look, uh, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.639
On Lake Michigan.

34:57.723 --> 35:00.225
Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you goin'?

35:00.309 --> 35:05.647
Ah, well, I gotta...
I gotta hit the showers now,

35:05.731 --> 35:09.067
but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.

35:09.109 --> 35:13.071
- Yeah. Me too.
- All right.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.908
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

35:20.662 --> 35:24.833
- 'Appenin' Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

35:24.917 --> 35:28.504
What d'ya say, fellas? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

35:28.587 --> 35:32.799
Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

35:32.883 --> 35:35.427
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

35:35.511 --> 35:39.515
Spank me! Spank me!
Hit that high "C."

35:39.598 --> 35:41.558
# Ahhhh #

35:44.895 --> 35:47.105
Come on!
What's goin' on here?

35:52.027 --> 35:54.905
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.866
I'm a... I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.452
I think shithead
really says it.

36:00.536 --> 36:02.788
You know what? You're right.
I'm a shithead, and
I want to make it up to you.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.998
You know what? You're right.
I'm a shithead, and
I want to make it up to you.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.583
Oh, yeah? How?

36:06.583 --> 36:08.085
Oh, yeah? How?

36:08.335 --> 36:11.129
# Don't make me #

36:11.171 --> 36:13.841
- # Over #
- Vicky. Your parents are downstairs.

36:13.924 --> 36:17.135
- Kevin, don't stop!
- Just a second.

36:17.219 --> 36:20.138
# I'm rockin' steady #

36:20.222 --> 36:23.058
# In demonology #

36:23.141 --> 36:28.397
# Hey so that you could make it #

36:31.108 --> 36:35.279
- # You're really makin' it ##
- Hon, can you tell Vic
to come on down for supper?

36:35.362 --> 36:41.201
- Holy shit!
- Shh. You know there's
no lock on your door?

36:46.707 --> 36:49.918
Ohh! I'm coming!
I'm coming!

36:54.298 --> 36:56.550
- Oh, Jim!
- Dad.

36:56.633 --> 36:59.928
Hi, I was just looking
at the old family portrait out here.

37:00.012 --> 37:02.681
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

37:02.723 --> 37:05.184
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

37:05.225 --> 37:09.521
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

37:09.813 --> 37:14.067
Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.

37:14.151 --> 37:16.278
And I have
to admit, uh, you know.

37:16.361 --> 37:20.824
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

37:20.908 --> 37:25.037
- I, uh... I used to call it
"stroking the salami."

37:25.120 --> 37:27.748
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."

37:27.789 --> 37:30.459
I never did it
with baked goods.

37:30.542 --> 37:35.047
But you know your Uncle Mort?
He "pinched the one-eyed snake"
five, six times a day.

37:35.130 --> 37:39.301
See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.

37:39.384 --> 37:42.513
You see?
It's like... It's like...

37:42.596 --> 37:45.474
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

37:45.557 --> 37:49.520
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

37:49.561 --> 37:52.397
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.

37:52.481 --> 37:55.901
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

37:55.984 --> 37:59.530
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.

37:59.613 --> 38:01.532
- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.

38:01.573 --> 38:05.619
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.

38:05.702 --> 38:07.579
Good.

38:07.663 --> 38:12.125
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

38:12.209 --> 38:14.586
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

38:14.670 --> 38:16.964
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

38:17.005 --> 38:21.760
You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.

38:21.844 --> 38:25.681
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

38:25.764 --> 38:28.392
So, does your tongue cramp up?

38:28.475 --> 38:32.563
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.

38:32.646 --> 38:36.525
That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

38:37.818 --> 38:41.780
All right. Class dismissed.

38:44.241 --> 38:48.829
Still questing after the Holy Grail,
huh, guys?

38:52.249 --> 38:54.251
Hey, uh,
where's Finch?

38:54.334 --> 38:56.378
Oh, he went home to take a shit.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.422
I don't get it.
I just don't.

38:58.505 --> 39:01.341
How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

39:01.383 --> 39:04.887
- What reputation?
- Observe.

39:04.928 --> 39:08.932
Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

39:09.016 --> 39:12.394
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

39:12.436 --> 39:18.192
- You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

39:18.275 --> 39:22.029
Well, um, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

39:22.112 --> 39:24.531
Bye.

39:24.615 --> 39:28.619
Okay. Explain.

39:28.702 --> 39:31.663
I can't. I don't
know how he's doing it.

39:31.705 --> 39:35.000
I, uh... I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.294
- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

39:37.336 --> 39:39.463
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?

39:39.546 --> 39:41.673
James?

39:41.757 --> 39:43.717
You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

39:43.800 --> 39:47.888
Me? Y-Yes. No, uh...

39:47.930 --> 39:51.433
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help
me with my studies.

39:51.475 --> 39:53.644
Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

39:53.727 --> 39:55.729
Tha-Tha-Tha... That would be...
That would be great sometime.

39:55.812 --> 40:00.400
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.

40:00.442 --> 40:03.612
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

40:03.695 --> 40:05.948
I could change
clothes at your place.

40:07.574 --> 40:11.328
Oh. Uh... yeah.

40:11.411 --> 40:15.374
I suppose that
would be okay. Sure.

40:21.088 --> 40:25.884
Nice car!

40:25.968 --> 40:28.387
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

40:28.470 --> 40:31.807
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

40:31.890 --> 40:34.893
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

40:34.935 --> 40:37.980
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

40:38.021 --> 40:41.608
I asked you because I thought you might
actually be worth going with.

40:41.692 --> 40:45.320
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

40:45.404 --> 40:48.323
Wait!
I don't understand.

40:48.407 --> 40:51.743
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

40:51.827 --> 40:53.954
Heather, I wasn't
makin' fun of you.

40:54.037 --> 40:56.582
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.

40:59.793 --> 41:04.882
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

41:04.965 --> 41:07.092
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

41:07.176 --> 41:10.971
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

41:11.054 --> 41:14.516
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

41:18.437 --> 41:22.107
No. I cannot do that to her.

41:22.191 --> 41:25.569
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

41:25.652 --> 41:30.449
If you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick,
how you gonna sleep with one?

41:30.532 --> 41:33.202
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

41:33.243 --> 41:36.497
See, even shit-brick
knows you should do it.

41:36.538 --> 41:40.083
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

41:40.167 --> 41:42.127
and tell me the address.

41:42.211 --> 41:45.005
You can send me
the address too.

41:45.088 --> 41:48.008
I'll save
you a seat.

41:48.091 --> 41:53.597
# How sweet it is
to be loved by you, by you #

41:53.680 --> 41:58.268
- # I needed the shelter
of someone's arms #
- # Someone's arms #

41:58.310 --> 42:02.147
- # There you were #
- # You were, oh #

42:02.231 --> 42:06.777
# I needed someone
who understands my ups and downs #

42:06.860 --> 42:08.904
# There you were ##

42:08.987 --> 42:13.325
Okay, that was good, but
I want to thicken-up that solo.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.661
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

42:15.744 --> 42:17.996
Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.750
No, it's not that. I think it'll
work better as a duet with a tenor part.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.794
I'll do it.

42:25.128 --> 42:27.506
- Dick.
- I'll do it.

42:27.589 --> 42:29.842
Great.
See you tomorrow.

42:31.510 --> 42:33.929
Hmph.

42:36.682 --> 42:39.852
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to.

42:39.935 --> 42:43.313
Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

42:43.355 --> 42:46.483
You better practice.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.871
Come in.

43:00.581 --> 43:05.169
Jim? There's a, uh...
a young lady here to see you.

43:05.252 --> 43:07.504
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi, James. Ready to study?

43:07.588 --> 43:10.299
Oh, he's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm, this kid.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.886
- Dad.
- That means... He's not-not
one of those nerdy guys but...

43:13.969 --> 43:18.807
- Dad!
- Well, I'Il... I'll let
you two hit the books.

43:22.936 --> 43:25.981
You want a beer?

43:26.064 --> 43:29.860
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

43:29.902 --> 43:33.989
Steve! It's my computer!
And I wanna use it!

43:34.072 --> 43:36.033
Shut up!

43:36.116 --> 43:38.827
Oh, you need to...
You need to change, right?

43:38.911 --> 43:41.538
- Uhh, do you mind?
- No. N-No, not at all.

43:41.580 --> 43:45.459
Uh, please, you know.
Just go ahead and get un... get changed.

43:45.542 --> 43:48.921
I'll, uh... I'll
go downstairs and start studying up.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.839
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.634
- Oh...
- All right, there he goes.

43:53.717 --> 43:54.927
Now,
we're in business.

43:54.968 --> 43:56.178
Now,
we're in business.

43:58.263 --> 44:00.474
- Back in a sec.
- Jimmy, honey, wh...

44:11.985 --> 44:17.032
# He pauses shaving and he tells himself
that he is the bomb #

44:17.115 --> 44:21.537
# She has her curlers set, her credit
cards are paying the funds #

44:21.620 --> 44:25.082
- # He's not that old I've been told ##
- Ah, here she is.

44:26.792 --> 44:30.420
- Did I miss anything?
- No. You are just in time.

44:30.462 --> 44:33.924
- Oh. Ohh!
- This is incredible.

44:33.966 --> 44:36.718
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.763
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, geez.

44:39.847 --> 44:42.224
God bless
the Internet.

44:42.266 --> 44:45.310
- Ai-yi-yi.
- Do it. Take it off.

44:45.394 --> 44:47.729
Oh, my God.

44:47.813 --> 44:50.524
Oh, thank you, God,
for this wonderful, wonderful day.

44:50.607 --> 44:54.862
- She takes her vitamins.
- # And it is way too unhealthy #

44:54.903 --> 44:57.197
# Often they've typically ##

44:57.281 --> 44:59.199
Stop hyperventilating.

45:04.246 --> 45:08.917
This is, like,
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

45:09.001 --> 45:12.337
I know.

45:12.379 --> 45:15.090
Can you believe... This is definitely
one of Stifler's best ideas ever.

45:16.675 --> 45:18.760
What is she...
She's touching my stuff.

45:18.844 --> 45:21.471
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Man, let her touch.

45:21.555 --> 45:24.725
- She's going through my stuff!
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

45:31.023 --> 45:34.234
- Oh.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

45:34.318 --> 45:36.778
- No, no.
- Oh, nice collection there, Jim.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.490
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

45:39.573 --> 45:42.242
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

45:42.284 --> 45:44.995
She reads
the articles.

45:57.925 --> 46:00.219
Is she?

46:00.260 --> 46:04.348
She's goin' downstairs.

46:13.023 --> 46:17.319
- Oh, my God!
- Jackpot, baby!

46:17.361 --> 46:20.656
- Can you believe this?
- Nadia, I would have never known.

46:20.739 --> 46:23.534
I have an announcement
that I would like to make.

46:23.617 --> 46:27.496
There is a gorgeous woman...
masturbating on my bed!

46:27.538 --> 46:32.960
- Thank you, Nadia!
- If you ever had a chance
with Nadia, this is it.

46:33.043 --> 46:37.589
- What am I
supposed to do, Kev?
- Seduce her.

46:37.631 --> 46:40.759
Wha... What the hell
would I say?

46:40.843 --> 46:44.221
Go over there and ask her
if she needs an extra hand.

46:44.304 --> 46:48.225
- That's stupid, Kev. I can't...
- That's not stupid! You're
stupid if you don't go!

46:48.308 --> 46:50.269
Come on!
Get over there!

46:50.310 --> 46:52.604
- Get goin', man. She's prime.
- Get out of here!

46:52.646 --> 46:55.983
- She's waitin' for you.
- Okay, all right. I'm goin'.

46:56.066 --> 46:58.068
- Go!
- Go!
- I'm goin'!

46:58.152 --> 47:00.070
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Oh, shit.

47:08.954 --> 47:12.624
# She's open
waiting for more #

47:12.708 --> 47:17.171
# And I know he's only
lookin' to score #

47:20.007 --> 47:21.925
- # Often they've typically #
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

47:22.009 --> 47:25.637
# Been starved
for attention before ##

47:28.015 --> 47:30.809
Oh, boy. Oh, God.
Oh, crap. Oh, no.

47:30.893 --> 47:34.229
Hello?

47:34.313 --> 47:38.025
- Looks like Jim addressed
the e-mail wrong.
- What?

47:38.108 --> 47:41.361
It went out to every mailbox
in the East High directory.

47:41.445 --> 47:43.447
God, how juvenile.

47:43.530 --> 47:45.449
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

47:45.532 --> 47:50.037
- # Baby #
- Check this out! Oh, my God!

47:52.498 --> 47:54.625
Oh.

47:55.125 --> 47:59.922
Please, God,
let this be it.

47:59.963 --> 48:02.007
Please?

48:05.969 --> 48:10.641
S- Somebody's goin' in there.

48:12.100 --> 48:14.394
Here you go.
That's what you need to do.

48:14.478 --> 48:16.563
- That guy's in my trig class.
- Oh, no.

48:19.149 --> 48:22.653
- Looks like you could use an extra hand.
- Jim!

48:22.736 --> 48:25.614
- Well... Oh, God.
- Shame on you.

48:25.697 --> 48:27.908
Yeah, shame on me.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

48:27.950 --> 48:30.410
- Uh, you know, I'm just gonna go.
- Well,

48:30.452 --> 48:33.789
you have seen me.

48:33.872 --> 48:36.959
Now, it's
my turn to see you.

48:38.502 --> 48:41.547
Strip!

48:41.547 --> 48:44.007
- Strip?
- Slowly.

48:44.049 --> 48:48.220
Uh, you mean,
like, strip strip?

48:48.303 --> 48:51.431
For me.

48:51.515 --> 48:53.642
What is he
talkin' to her about?

48:53.684 --> 48:58.605
- Uh, no idea.
- Come on, Jim. People are
viewing. Get to business.

49:01.859 --> 49:04.361
Perfect!

49:04.444 --> 49:07.906
- Move, James! Move!
- Yeah, yeah. Move.

49:15.956 --> 49:18.584
Go, trig boy! It's yer birthday!

49:29.720 --> 49:31.263
- No! No. No.
- Please, God.

49:31.346 --> 49:33.724
What's going on?

49:38.604 --> 49:41.732
- Yes!
- All right. Get in the mix!

49:41.815 --> 49:44.067
- See there.
- Oh, okay.

49:45.777 --> 49:51.241
- This is disgusting.
- What the fuck is this?

49:52.576 --> 49:54.870
Cut it out, man!

49:59.583 --> 50:01.668
Yeah.

50:13.514 --> 50:15.807
Freak.

50:20.020 --> 50:22.189
Did not just
take out that chair.

50:22.272 --> 50:26.235
- Yup, he took out the chair.
- More, more, you bad boy!

50:26.360 --> 50:30.405
Oh, yeah, I'm naughty. I'm naughty,
baby. Hyah!

50:30.489 --> 50:33.909
Ohh, God!

50:33.992 --> 50:37.120
# Calling your name #

50:37.204 --> 50:40.249
- # Calling your name #
- Now,

50:40.290 --> 50:42.709
come to me.

50:42.751 --> 50:45.379
Oh, yeah.

50:52.261 --> 50:54.304
- Here we go.
- He's in, man.

50:54.388 --> 50:56.223
- # Calling #
- This just got a hell of a lot better.

50:56.265 --> 51:00.310
- Be gentle.
- Okay.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.565
- # Calling your name #
- Uh...

51:04.648 --> 51:06.859
- # Calling #
- Oh.

51:06.942 --> 51:09.444
# Your name ##

51:09.528 --> 51:11.363
Jim?

51:11.446 --> 51:16.160
- Oh! Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

51:16.201 --> 51:19.329
- Oh. Ohh!
- Liftoff aborted.

51:19.413 --> 51:22.374
Houston, we have a problem.

51:22.457 --> 51:25.836
What happened? What did he do

51:25.919 --> 51:27.880
He blew it.

51:27.963 --> 51:30.382
I guess
I'll be going now.

51:30.465 --> 51:36.013
No, no, no, I'm... I'm not done, Nadia.
I've, uh... I've got reserves.

51:36.096 --> 51:38.849
Nadia, please, please.
I'm begging you.

51:38.932 --> 51:41.768
Well, I do like
your dirty magazines.

51:41.810 --> 51:47.149
You do? Okay. Well. Um.
Did-Did... Did you see this one?

51:47.232 --> 51:51.862
This here is your... is your more,
uh, exotic, risque magazine.

51:51.945 --> 51:53.947
- He's pullin' out the porn.
- He's desperate.

51:54.031 --> 51:55.949
Jim, just wait
till she leaves.

51:56.033 --> 51:58.660
Very arousing women.
They arouse me...

51:58.744 --> 52:00.704
They arouse me
very, very much.

52:00.746 --> 52:04.666
But, uh...
But not as arousing as you.

52:04.750 --> 52:08.712
- Oh, Jim!
- Oh, God!

52:13.217 --> 52:16.720
Yes!

52:16.803 --> 52:18.931
He's ruining daisy!
Whoo!

52:21.558 --> 52:26.063
So, uh, "shaved"
is the expression?

52:29.149 --> 52:31.068
Holy shit.

52:31.151 --> 52:34.321
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

52:34.404 --> 52:37.074
- H-H-Holy shit!
- Touch me, Jim.

52:39.535 --> 52:41.620
Here.

52:41.703 --> 52:45.123
Oh. Oh.

52:45.207 --> 52:47.626
- Again?
- Not again.

52:47.709 --> 52:50.963
- Not again, man!
- Is that possible?

52:51.004 --> 52:52.256
What a loser.

52:52.297 --> 52:53.507
What a loser.

52:57.135 --> 52:58.595
Hey!

53:19.783 --> 53:24.496
# I needed someone
to understand my ups and downs #

53:24.538 --> 53:27.749
# There you were #

53:27.833 --> 53:32.671
# With sweet love
and devotion #

53:32.713 --> 53:35.257
# Deeply touching
my emotion #

53:35.340 --> 53:39.928
# I just wanna stop
and thank you, baby ##

53:42.139 --> 53:44.558
- Hey, minute man!
- Shut up.

53:44.641 --> 53:46.560
You know... You know you're
supposed to be supportive.

53:46.643 --> 53:50.939
Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia?

53:50.981 --> 53:54.151
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'Net.

53:54.234 --> 53:56.153
I-I really don't
think they liked it.

53:56.236 --> 53:58.405
How do
you know that?

53:58.447 --> 54:00.532
She's already on a plane back home.

54:00.616 --> 54:02.576
Yeah.

54:02.659 --> 54:06.413
You know, guys? Maybe I'm just
not good with girls, period.

54:06.497 --> 54:10.042
No-no-no, really-really. Like... Like I
was born without that part of the brain.

54:10.083 --> 54:12.252
I mean, I can't
talk to girls.

54:12.336 --> 54:14.379
And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.

54:14.463 --> 54:17.549
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

54:19.092 --> 54:23.013
And one time at band camp,

54:23.096 --> 54:25.307
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,

54:25.390 --> 54:28.435
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

54:28.519 --> 54:33.482
A- And this one time, we all
lost our music and we were
supposed to play this song,

54:33.565 --> 54:38.821
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,

54:38.904 --> 54:42.866
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

54:42.950 --> 54:45.369
So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.

54:45.452 --> 54:47.371
You know what
I do when I'm angry?

54:47.454 --> 54:50.624
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.

54:50.666 --> 54:53.877
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh...

54:53.961 --> 54:57.297
You have no idea
why I'm angry?

54:57.381 --> 55:00.592
Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky...

55:00.676 --> 55:03.929
- when I know I have
a big test to study for.

55:03.971 --> 55:08.308
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...

55:08.392 --> 55:11.103
- because this one time at band camp...
- W-What's your name?

55:11.145 --> 55:13.021
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.

55:13.105 --> 55:15.065
Michelle, um...

55:15.149 --> 55:17.943
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

55:18.026 --> 55:21.405
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

55:24.992 --> 55:28.120
Yes. Seriously.

55:28.203 --> 55:31.790
Are we going to Steve Stifler's
party afterwards?
Because that would be so cool.

55:31.874 --> 55:37.212
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool! We're gonna have
such a good time.

55:37.254 --> 55:42.426
It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire...

55:57.191 --> 56:00.277
Hi.

56:00.360 --> 56:03.947
- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.

56:04.031 --> 56:07.451
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.

56:07.493 --> 56:09.620
We're gonna have
to work on that song.

56:10.829 --> 56:13.790
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.

56:13.832 --> 56:16.084
So you work nights?

56:18.378 --> 56:21.215
- My dad's the manager.
- Really?

56:21.256 --> 56:24.343
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

56:26.428 --> 56:29.306
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.

56:29.389 --> 56:32.142
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

56:32.226 --> 56:35.103
I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.

56:35.145 --> 56:40.943
I mean, how am I supposed to
know what my "most emotionally
significant moment" was?

56:41.026 --> 56:45.572
So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.

56:45.656 --> 56:47.658
- Onions?
- What?

56:47.741 --> 56:50.285
You, uh, want onions?

56:50.369 --> 56:52.287
Oh, no, thank you.

56:55.040 --> 56:57.668
So what are you
gonna major in?

56:57.709 --> 57:01.797
State's got a good business
school, and I could probably
walk-on to the lacrosse team.

57:01.839 --> 57:05.759
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?

57:05.843 --> 57:09.429
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

57:09.513 --> 57:12.599
what am I gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player?

57:12.683 --> 57:14.643
I really have no idea.

57:14.685 --> 57:18.063
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.

57:18.147 --> 57:20.065
Well, you're not.

57:21.525 --> 57:23.569
So we're gonna be
close next year.

57:31.535 --> 57:33.453
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

57:33.537 --> 57:36.874
Yeah.

57:36.957 --> 57:38.876
What are you
talkin' about?

57:38.917 --> 57:42.963
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.

57:43.046 --> 57:45.215
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

57:45.299 --> 57:49.678
I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.

57:49.720 --> 57:53.765
Finch.
Shit-brick.

57:53.849 --> 57:56.518
Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.

57:56.602 --> 57:59.021
You look okay.

57:59.104 --> 58:02.608
I-I mean, the scars
healed really well.

58:02.691 --> 58:04.610
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

58:07.446 --> 58:09.406
What was that
all about?

58:09.490 --> 58:13.869
- He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?

58:13.952 --> 58:16.121
What do you mean,
"no comment"?

58:16.163 --> 58:19.249
- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding? No.

58:19.333 --> 58:22.878
Then how did all this
get started?

58:22.961 --> 58:26.173
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

58:26.256 --> 58:29.426
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

58:29.510 --> 58:32.471
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

58:32.554 --> 58:35.182
I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

58:35.265 --> 58:37.601
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

58:37.684 --> 58:40.562
and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

58:40.604 --> 58:43.398
So he did,
and I did.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.526
- That actually works?
- Well, duh! Of course.

58:45.609 --> 58:48.153
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

58:48.195 --> 58:50.697
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

58:50.781 --> 58:52.741
No, I didn't hear that one.

58:52.783 --> 58:55.369
That one was my favorite.

58:55.452 --> 58:57.454
Do that cheerleader.

58:57.538 --> 59:01.041
- # Thank you, baby #
- She wants me. She calls me up...

59:01.124 --> 59:05.587
# How sweet it is
to be loved by you ##

59:05.671 --> 59:08.799
Oh, my God,
you're gay!

59:08.882 --> 59:10.801
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

59:10.884 --> 59:14.096
No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.

59:14.179 --> 59:17.850
If you try that at M.S.U.
This Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

59:17.933 --> 59:19.935
Our last game
is this Saturday.

59:20.018 --> 59:22.146
Yeah, well, shit.

59:25.065 --> 59:29.111
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

59:29.194 --> 59:32.948
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.

59:33.073 --> 59:35.784
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State,

59:35.868 --> 59:38.453
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

59:38.495 --> 59:40.497
So you can't sing
at the competition.

59:40.581 --> 59:43.292
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

59:43.375 --> 59:48.088
It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.

59:49.715 --> 59:53.427
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

59:53.510 --> 59:56.013
Yeah.

59:56.054 --> 59:59.099
So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later?

01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:17.034
Hey, Kevin.

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:22.164
- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?

01:00:22.206 --> 01:00:24.333
Me? Nothing.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:26.668
See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:30.214
But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:33.509
I don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.

01:00:33.592 --> 01:00:35.594
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:40.724
Oh, God!

01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:43.936
Oh! Oh!

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.444
Jesus.

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:55.030
Right this way,
sir.

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:04.373
Oh, God.

01:01:32.192 --> 01:01:35.154
Oh, no.

01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:37.698
It's gonna be fun.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:40.325
You know it's just gonna be
some crappy band and stupid decorations.

01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:44.037
You're just saying
that because prom's a week away
and you don't have a date.

01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.582
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:51.170
Finch is goin' stag and... so am I.

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:54.506
God, he's like so...
refined.

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:57.759
- You think that
older woman thing is true?

01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:01.138
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.

01:02:03.182 --> 01:02:06.518
Joanie, was that you?

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:08.896
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:11.982
Oh!

01:02:15.944 --> 01:02:18.030
Eww!

01:02:40.719 --> 01:02:44.973
Yeah!

01:02:45.057 --> 01:02:48.018
Kev?
I think we've come...

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.647
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.649
Maybe it's time...

01:02:53.732 --> 01:02:57.694
we start to express ourselves
in new ways.

01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.030
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it?

01:03:00.113 --> 01:03:02.908
- Yeah.
- I love you.

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:07.246
It's your turn.

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:10.749
That's not
what I was thinking.

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:14.878
Sex. It's always
about sex.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.048
It's not
always about sex.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:21.218
I just thought it was
about sex this time.

01:03:24.596 --> 01:03:28.934
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around,

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:30.936
and-and people
don't mean it.

01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:34.231
When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:37.025
- You know? I want it to be...
- Perfect.

01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:41.071
Exactly.

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:43.949
- Okay, Albert.
You ready?
- No problemo.

01:03:45.284 --> 01:03:49.121
# I close my eyes
at night #

01:03:49.204 --> 01:03:51.498
Come on, Heather.
Work with me here.

01:03:57.004 --> 01:03:59.798
Goal, Ostreicher!

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.552
- All right, Oz!
- Atta boy, Ozzie!

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:05.554
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!

01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:08.307
- We're crushing you losers!
- Let's go, fellas!

01:04:08.348 --> 01:04:10.392
Come on!
Whoo-hoo!

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:16.648
# Bumblebee, bumblebee,
bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee #

01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:18.775
Focus on the music.
Think melody.

01:04:18.817 --> 01:04:21.904
- Let the music be my guide.
- That would be a start.

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:34.583
Who's the man?
Stifler!

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.005
Huddle up, guys! Huddle up!

01:04:48.055 --> 01:04:51.558
Huddle up!
Come on! Okay.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.519
All right, all right!

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.813
- Good hustle, guys.
- Good hustle.

01:04:55.896 --> 01:05:00.859
But you can still lose. You all saw
what happened to Oz out there.

01:05:00.943 --> 01:05:06.156
I don't want to ever see any of you
thinking you're gonna score.

01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:09.409
You don't score
until you score.

01:05:09.493 --> 01:05:11.954
- Until you score.
- That's right, baby!

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:14.331
It all boils down
to today.

01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:18.293
For you seniors,
this marks the culmination...

01:05:18.335 --> 01:05:21.380
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.

01:05:21.463 --> 01:05:26.093
I want you to think about
what this means to you.

01:05:26.134 --> 01:05:29.263
Do you guys wanna look back
on your days at East...

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:33.016
and know that you used
the time you had?

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.769
- Hell, yeah!
- You do!

01:05:37.729 --> 01:05:41.108
- Ah! Good attitude, Ostreicher.
- Good luck, fellas.

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:44.653
Christ, I didn't tell ya
to leave the game.

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:46.697
I'm sorry, Coach.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.741
You got someplace more important
to be, Ostreicher?

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:52.077
Yeah.

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:54.329
Ostreicher!

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:58.834
Oz?
Fuckface?

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:01.545
Ostreicher!

01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:29.448
- Hey, Oz!
- Ozmeister!

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.492
- Oh, great.
- What about the game?

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:34.620
- I'm not playing.
- You're missing the game for us?

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:37.915
No, I'm missing the game
for you.

01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:45.047
- D-Does this mean I'm not
gonna get to do the duet?
- Albert, you suck.

01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:52.137
I don't think
he's comin' back.

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:54.389
# Close my eyes at night #

01:06:54.431 --> 01:06:59.311
- # Close my eyes #
- # Wonderin' where would I be
without you in my life #

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:03.148
- # Oh #
- # Everything I did was just a bore #

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:08.195
- # Just a bore #
- # Everywhere I went
seems I been there before #

01:07:08.237 --> 01:07:12.491
# But you brighten up
for me all of my days #

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:15.828
- # With a love so sweet #
- # In so many ways #

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:18.121
# I just wanna stop #

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:22.793
- # And thank you, baby #
- # I just wanna stop #

01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:26.129
- # And thank you, baby #
- # Thank you, baby #

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:30.801
# How sweet it is
to be loved by you ##

01:07:34.012 --> 01:07:36.306
Yeah, Oz!
You fuckin' rule!

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.017
- Fuckin' rule!
- Yeah!

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:43.897
Maybe the words
aren't that important.

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.191
It's like, I know he
really cares about me, you know?

01:07:46.275 --> 01:07:48.360
Even if he can't
say it, he does.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:52.364
And yeah, he always talks about sex, but
that's okay, 'cause he's a guy, right?

01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:55.075
- He's got a dick. He's a guy.
- Right.

01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:57.077
Wait. Is this
translation right?

01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:00.122
"Go home, bird teacher.
I've had enough."

01:08:00.164 --> 01:08:03.125
I don't know.
I got it from Kevin.

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:06.753
- So, does it hurt?
- What?

01:08:06.837 --> 01:08:09.548
You know... sex.
Does it hurt?

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:14.011
Yeah. I mean, the first time you do it,
you know, it hurts.

01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:18.223
But then you, you do it again
and again and again...

01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:21.518
It just starts to feel good.
Really good.

01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:24.645
Okay, so say
I don't do it.

01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:29.484
And then I go off to college. I might
end up doing it with some random guy...

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:33.279
- who totally turns out to be a jerk.
- This is true.

01:08:33.322 --> 01:08:36.033
And I'll wish I would've
done it with Kevin.

01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:38.368
So go do it with Kevin.

01:08:38.452 --> 01:08:41.537
- You think?
- Yeah. You're... You're ready.

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:45.959
- You're woman. Look at you.
You're ready for sex.
- You're right.

01:08:46.001 --> 01:08:48.420
- I know.
- I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna have sex.

01:08:48.504 --> 01:08:51.131
- Now.
- And it's gonna be right, and
it's gonna be just perfect.

01:08:51.173 --> 01:08:53.300
- Perfect sex.
- Thanks, Jessica.

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:55.886
Please.

01:08:55.969 --> 01:08:58.764
Kevin.

01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:00.890
Kevin.

01:09:02.475 --> 01:09:05.895
- I wanna have sex.
- Now?

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:13.194
Prom.

01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:20.743
# As you walk up those steps
and garner your award #

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:24.872
# Try not to forget about me #

01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:28.126
# 'Cause I was there when you
had no one else to hold #

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:34.049
# You used to look
just like a saint #

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:36.051
# And stumble into walls #

01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:39.720
# You're a guy's
very own quarantine #

01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:44.225
# You used to never
think you'd ever grow old ##

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.322
You must be excited
about the big night tonight.

01:09:57.364 --> 01:09:59.533
Thrilled.

01:09:59.616 --> 01:10:01.118
Who's the lucky girl?

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.661
Who's the lucky girl?

01:10:02.744 --> 01:10:04.663
Michelle.

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:07.833
- Michelle.
- Yeah.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:12.087
- She must be very special.
- Oh, she's special, all right.

01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.174
I'm sure she is special if you
picked her out of the whole bunch.

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:20.637
Jim, I'm just gonna
say one thing...

01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:22.639
before you leave
tonight.

01:10:24.266 --> 01:10:28.562
I want you to be very,
very careful...

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:31.231
when you're
putting on...

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.942
the corsage.

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:38.947
Okay, Dad.

01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:41.408
- Promise me.
- I promise.

01:11:02.179 --> 01:11:05.724
# Midnight at the oasis #

01:11:06.934 --> 01:11:10.103
# Send your camel to bed #

01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:16.193
# Shadows painting our faces #

01:11:16.276 --> 01:11:18.612
# Traces #

01:11:18.695 --> 01:11:22.616
# Of romance in our heads #

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:25.953
# Heaven's holding a half-moon #

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.749
# Shining just for us #

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:36.839
# Let's slip off
to a sand dune #

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.091
# Real soon #

01:11:39.174 --> 01:11:42.094
# And kick up a little dust #

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:47.182
# Come on
Cactus is our friend #

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:51.562
# He'll point out the way #

01:11:51.645 --> 01:11:54.356
You know, at band camp
we have dances like this,

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:56.608
only they're way funner.

01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:01.113
# Till the evenin' ends ##

01:12:11.206 --> 01:12:14.459
All right, status check.
Where do you guys stand?

01:12:14.543 --> 01:12:18.338
Finch, we know where you are,
but can't really use that as an excuse.

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:20.340
Jim?

01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:24.678
Uh, my date's a flute-toting band dork.
Does that answer your question?

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:28.223
Oz, is this vocal-jazz shit
gonna pay off or what?

01:12:28.307 --> 01:12:31.059
Kevin, what's with
the attitude?

01:12:31.143 --> 01:12:34.062
Attitude? Me?

01:12:34.146 --> 01:12:36.773
I think you guys should be
a little more enthusiastic.

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:39.359
This is the night
we've been waiting for.

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:41.528
We're in this together.
You guys can't back out.

01:12:41.612 --> 01:12:45.240
Kev, you don't need us to get laid.
Are you afraid or something?

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:48.744
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:52.247
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to...

01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:56.168
Have to what, Kev, huh?
I don't have to do shit.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:59.630
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:04.468
I've never even had sex, and already,
I can't stand it. I hate sex!

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:07.513
And I'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

01:13:07.554 --> 01:13:09.932
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:12.142
I'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there...

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:15.312
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

01:13:15.395 --> 01:13:17.356
Goddamn.

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:22.069
Yeah.

01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:25.489
You know, at least I learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:27.533
Hey, Finch.

01:13:27.616 --> 01:13:30.327
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

01:13:35.707 --> 01:13:39.127
- How come you have no date?
- I like to keep my options open.

01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:41.129
I got something for you.

01:13:43.048 --> 01:13:45.551
Consider it
a consolation prize.

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:51.557
Jessica, this is great!

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:55.978
- Felt sorta guilty
about taking your money.
- You spent $200 on this?

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:59.273
<i>No, I spent 50 on the flask,
150 on the earrings.</i>

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.360
- These are, uh...
- Let me just clarify...

01:14:03.402 --> 01:14:07.865
- that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch.
- Of course not!

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:10.492
So I take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh?

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.578
You met at that party
a while back, right?

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:14.580
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:17.749
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:20.794
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

01:14:20.878 --> 01:14:24.173
Deep conversation, huh?

01:14:24.256 --> 01:14:26.466
Is that
what you call it?

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.510
What else
would I call it?

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.311
Thank you, Great Falls.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:40.355
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.

01:14:44.735 --> 01:14:46.653
You suck!

01:14:49.573 --> 01:14:52.159
Excuse me, everyone.

01:14:52.242 --> 01:14:54.411
Sorry to interrupt.

01:14:54.453 --> 01:14:56.830
I just thought
you all should know this.

01:14:56.914 --> 01:14:59.583
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:01.919
I never had sex with him.

01:15:02.002 --> 01:15:06.423
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.

01:15:06.465 --> 01:15:10.344
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:13.722
Oh. He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

01:15:13.806 --> 01:15:18.101
Thank you for your time.

01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:33.826
- Guess what?
- Not interested.

01:15:33.909 --> 01:15:38.205
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:40.207
- I'm not going.
- What?

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.836
Why not?

01:15:43.919 --> 01:15:48.674
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

01:15:48.757 --> 01:15:51.134
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doin'.

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:54.596
I-I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

01:15:54.638 --> 01:15:58.350
I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and...

01:15:58.433 --> 01:16:00.352
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

01:16:00.435 --> 01:16:02.396
I mean,
I'm on the brink.

01:16:02.437 --> 01:16:06.024
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:10.195
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:14.366
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

01:16:14.449 --> 01:16:17.578
We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:19.997
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.167
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.545
We were friends
with Stifler?

01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:28.714
Hey, look.

01:16:29.923 --> 01:16:32.676
Sherman didn't even
get laid.

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:35.471
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.681
What?

01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:41.351
We'll tell you
on the bus.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:44.563
I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:47.149
My date too, perhaps?

01:16:48.817 --> 01:16:50.986
Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:52.988
That reminds me
of this one time...

01:16:53.071 --> 01:16:55.991
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:58.744
How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them,

01:16:58.785 --> 01:17:01.038
and you don't have any.

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:04.291
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh...

01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:07.127
They're just a little
more risque than tales of band camp.

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:11.757
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.759
Okay.
You want a story?

01:17:13.842 --> 01:17:16.428
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:23.894
- This is
the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.

01:17:34.696 --> 01:17:38.367
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.036
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:43.372
Fuckers,
fuckers, fuckers!

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.417
- Out.
- Aw, come on!

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.920
- Get out.
- Aw, man!

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.982
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:12.401
What's that?

01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:14.778
It's gonna sound
really bad, but, uh,

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.447
I want you to know.

01:18:17.531 --> 01:18:20.242
You see, uh,

01:18:20.284 --> 01:18:24.580
I'm a virgin,
and, uh...

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:27.291
Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were...

01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:30.085
We all made this pact...

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:33.046
that we would
lose our virginity...

01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:35.174
before high school
was over,

01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:38.302
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

01:18:40.304 --> 01:18:42.389
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

01:18:42.473 --> 01:18:45.267
No, that's...
That's not what I mean.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.520
W- What I mean is, uh...

01:18:48.604 --> 01:18:51.356
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.486
See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...

01:18:55.527 --> 01:18:58.238
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score...

01:18:58.322 --> 01:19:00.365
This isn't any better,
Chris.

01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:02.534
No, you see...
You see, Heather,

01:19:02.618 --> 01:19:05.037
what I realized is that...

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:10.000
with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...

01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:13.420
looking for
the best way to score.

01:19:13.462 --> 01:19:17.007
This may sound
a little corny, but...

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.301
I feel like
I've already won.

01:19:21.845 --> 01:19:26.266
And, uh,
I care about you a lot.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:29.770
Oz, I know.

01:19:30.938 --> 01:19:34.274
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:36.276
It's what your friends
call you.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.363
I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.

01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:43.200
And... your girlfriend?

01:19:45.494 --> 01:19:49.998
# Ain't never thought that
I could love like this #

01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:53.210
# This feeling inside me
is growing #

01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:57.840
# I never thought that
you would care ##

01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:18.944
Are ya lost?

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.326
You're Stifler's mom.
Uh...

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:29.121
No, no, not lost.
Just, um,

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:31.123
you know,
taking the tour.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:37.921
Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:40.424
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

01:20:45.387 --> 01:20:47.806
So, you enjoying yourself?

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:51.351
I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:53.770
I'm so happy for you.

01:20:53.854 --> 01:20:55.772
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

01:20:57.774 --> 01:21:01.028
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was...

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.530
It was a bathroom incident.

01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:08.160
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.

01:21:11.955 --> 01:21:14.333
You have
anything to drink?

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:16.335
I believe the kegs
are upstairs.

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:20.172
That is what
the cretins drink.

01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:22.341
I'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:25.385
- The good stuff.
- All right.

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.972
I got some scotch.

01:21:29.014 --> 01:21:33.644
<i>- Single malt?
- Aged 18 years.</i>

01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:35.646
The way I like it.

01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:41.652
Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar?

01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:46.740
I think I should.

01:21:46.824 --> 01:21:48.784
Allow me.

01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:52.329
You know it's
a bitchin' party.

01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:54.873
The Stif-man
always comes through in the clutch.

01:21:58.377 --> 01:22:01.839
And then he just
puked his brains out.

01:22:01.922 --> 01:22:04.842
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:07.052
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?

01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:09.179
It's sort of sexual.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:13.684
Yeah!
Yeah, let's hear it.

01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:18.605
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:22.359
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

01:22:22.401 --> 01:22:26.280
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

01:22:26.363 --> 01:22:28.282
And-And he plays
trombone...

01:22:28.365 --> 01:22:30.784
So how do you
want to be?

01:22:30.868 --> 01:22:33.829
Like... how do you
want to do it?

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.749
I don't know.
How do you?

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:42.588
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.

01:22:44.298 --> 01:22:46.216
Okay.

01:22:52.473 --> 01:22:54.600
Kev?

01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:56.977
- Yeah?
- I wanna hear you say it.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.480
Okay.

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:04.693
Victoria,

01:23:04.776 --> 01:23:06.695
I love you.

01:23:08.447 --> 01:23:11.158
I love you.

01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:24.713
# Don't stray #

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:27.466
# Don't ever go away #

01:23:27.549 --> 01:23:30.010
# I should be
much too smart for this #

01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:32.596
# You know it gets
the better of me #

01:23:32.679 --> 01:23:37.309
# Sometimes
when you and I collide #

01:23:37.392 --> 01:23:39.645
- # I fall into an ocean of you #
- Oh. My hair.

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:42.064
# Pull me out in time #

01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:43.982
# Don't let me drown #

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.610
# Let me down #

01:23:46.652 --> 01:23:49.154
You okay?

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:53.158
Yeah. Go slow.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.078
# Say you'll stay #

01:23:56.161 --> 01:23:59.248
# Don't come and go #

01:23:59.331 --> 01:24:01.333
# Like you do #

01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:05.838
# Sway my way #

01:24:05.921 --> 01:24:09.216
# Yeah, I need to know #

01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:11.969
# All about you #

01:24:13.262 --> 01:24:15.722
# Say you'll stay ##

01:24:15.806 --> 01:24:18.725
So the end of the story
is you...

01:24:18.809 --> 01:24:20.894
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

01:24:20.978 --> 01:24:24.940
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

01:24:25.023 --> 01:24:29.153
- but I didn't care
because it was so funny.
- I get it.

01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:32.990
And this one time at band camp,
I stuck a flute in my pussy.

01:24:35.284 --> 01:24:37.411
Excuse me?

01:24:37.494 --> 01:24:40.205
What? You don't think I know
how to get myself off?

01:24:40.289 --> 01:24:43.709
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is... Sex Ed.

01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:46.920
So are we gonna screw soon,
'cause I'm gettin' kinda antsy.

01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:58.223
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!

01:24:59.725 --> 01:25:04.146
Ow!

01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:06.440
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

01:25:06.482 --> 01:25:08.692
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

01:25:08.734 --> 01:25:11.236
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

01:25:13.447 --> 01:25:15.782
What makes you think
that I would come early?

01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:19.953
Come on. I saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think I accepted this date?

01:25:19.995 --> 01:25:22.748
You're a sure thing.

01:25:24.833 --> 01:25:27.669
Yes, I am.

01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:32.424
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

01:25:39.723 --> 01:25:45.521
So, uh, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking?

01:25:45.562 --> 01:25:50.526
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

01:25:50.567 --> 01:25:52.653
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- # And here's to you #

01:25:52.694 --> 01:25:55.489
# Mrs. Robinson #

01:25:55.531 --> 01:25:59.326
# Jesus loves you more
than you will know #

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:04.998
# Stand up tall, Mrs. Robinson #

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.794
- Mmm, you're dead.
- # God in heaven
smiles on those who pray #

01:26:08.877 --> 01:26:12.172
# Hey, hey, hey #

01:26:12.256 --> 01:26:14.091
# Hey, hey, hey ##

01:26:14.133 --> 01:26:16.093
# Hey, hey, hey ##

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:19.096
# Sway my way #

01:26:19.138 --> 01:26:22.224
# Yeah, I need to know #

01:26:22.307 --> 01:26:25.435
# All about you #

01:26:25.519 --> 01:26:28.230
# And there's no cure #

01:26:28.313 --> 01:26:30.816
# And no way to be sure #

01:26:30.899 --> 01:26:33.318
# Why everything's
turned inside out #

01:26:33.402 --> 01:26:35.320
# Instilling so much doubt #

01:26:35.404 --> 01:26:38.031
# It makes me so tired #

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:40.701
# I feel so uninspired #

01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:43.287
# My head is battling
with my heart #

01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:47.166
# My logic has been torn apart
And now ##

01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:49.751
- I had
no idea you'd be this good.
- Neither did I.

01:26:49.835 --> 01:26:51.879
Oh, Finchy. Finch.

01:26:51.962 --> 01:26:54.882
- Oh, Stifler's mom!
- Finchy!

01:27:01.138 --> 01:27:04.141
Okay, let's go.

01:27:04.224 --> 01:27:06.685
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!

01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:08.896
Michelle, Michelle.

01:27:10.522 --> 01:27:12.441
Oh, God.

01:27:40.135 --> 01:27:42.095
That was
a great night, huh?

01:27:44.515 --> 01:27:46.433
Yeah.

01:27:48.435 --> 01:27:51.438
I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

01:27:51.522 --> 01:27:55.400
I know.
It went by so fast.

01:27:55.484 --> 01:27:58.111
Yeah, it did.

01:27:58.195 --> 01:28:00.113
Kevin?

01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:07.329
Next year with you
going to Ann Arbor...

01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:10.541
and me going to Ithaca,

01:28:10.624 --> 01:28:13.752
it's not gonna work,
is it?

01:28:13.836 --> 01:28:15.838
No.
Don't say that.

01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:18.423
I mean,
we could make it work.

01:28:19.758 --> 01:28:22.427
- It'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.

01:28:24.179 --> 01:28:26.598
- But...
- See, that's what I've been realizing...

01:28:26.682 --> 01:28:29.434
is that...
nothing's perfect.

01:28:29.476 --> 01:28:33.981
And you can't
plan everything.

01:28:34.064 --> 01:28:37.818
Well, I guess... you will
be pretty far away.

01:28:39.153 --> 01:28:42.156
And we'll be on our own,
meeting new people.

01:28:46.368 --> 01:28:48.328
Last night, though.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.043
I wasn't lying.

01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:58.338
I know.

01:29:14.021 --> 01:29:17.483
She's gone.
Wha...

01:29:17.566 --> 01:29:19.610
Oh, my God.
She used me.

01:29:19.693 --> 01:29:21.612
I was used.

01:29:23.572 --> 01:29:26.992
I was used.
Cool!

01:29:29.328 --> 01:29:31.288
What's this door locked...

01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:33.290
Mom, where's...

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:39.046
- Mom? Shit-brick?
- Hey, Stifler.

01:29:41.298 --> 01:29:44.635
# Do do do do do do do #

01:29:44.718 --> 01:29:48.138
I just gotta say that women,

01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:50.808
like a fine wine,
only get better with age.

01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:55.604
Of course, I have
no basis for comparison, but, uh,

01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:57.606
it was good.

01:29:57.648 --> 01:30:00.150
So you almost made it,
huh, Oz?

01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:04.363
- I'll just say that
we had a great night together.
- Hang in there, buddy.

01:30:04.446 --> 01:30:08.867
- You'll get there.
- You know, guys, I think
we're falling in love.

01:30:08.951 --> 01:30:12.788
Wha...

01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:15.374
That's great, man.
That's awesome.

01:30:16.667 --> 01:30:19.461
Y- You know what
the coolest thing is, guys?

01:30:19.545 --> 01:30:21.630
This.
You know, right now.

01:30:21.713 --> 01:30:25.425
It's true. I mean, after this,
everything's gonna be different.

01:30:25.509 --> 01:30:28.679
After... getting laid?

01:30:28.762 --> 01:30:31.723
- After high school.
- Here's to the next step.

01:30:31.807 --> 01:30:35.394
- To the next step.
- To the next step.
- To the next step.

01:30:37.146 --> 01:30:39.857
# Do do do do do do do #

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.776
# Do do do do do do do #

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:44.778
# Do do do do do do do #

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.281
# Do do do do do do do ##

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.958
# Chickety China, the Chinese
chicken, have a drumstick
and your brain stops tickin' #

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.085
# Watchin' X Files
with no lights on #

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:02.087
# We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one #

01:31:02.171 --> 01:31:04.298
# Like Harrison Ford
I'm getting frantic #

01:31:04.339 --> 01:31:05.466
# Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers guaranteed to satisfy #

01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:06.592
# Like Sting I'm tantric
Like Snickers guaranteed to satisfy #

01:31:06.633 --> 01:31:08.594
# Like Kurosawa
I make mad films #

01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:10.596
# Okay, I don't make films
but if I did they'd have a samurai #

01:31:10.679 --> 01:31:12.598
# Gonna get a set of better clubs,
gonna find the kind with tiny nubs #

01:31:12.681 --> 01:31:15.392
# So my irons aren't always
flyin' off the backswing #

01:31:15.476 --> 01:31:17.394
# Gonna get in tune
with Sailor Moon 'cause that cartoon #

01:31:17.478 --> 01:31:19.396
# Has got the boom anime babes
that make me think the wrong thing #

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:21.482
# How can I help it if I think
you're funny when you're mad #

01:31:21.565 --> 01:31:23.567
# Tryin' hard not to smile
though I feel bad #

01:31:23.609 --> 01:31:25.569
# I'm the kinda guy
who laughs at a funeral #

01:31:25.652 --> 01:31:27.404
- Sweetheart?
- # Can't understand what I mean
You soon will #

01:31:27.654 --> 01:31:29.865
# It's been one week
since you looked at me #

01:31:29.907 --> 01:31:30.908
# Dropped your eyes to the side
and said, I'm sorry ##

01:31:30.949 --> 01:31:31.867
# Dropped your eyes to the side
and said, I'm sorry ##

01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:35.913
# Hello to your mother
your brother significant other #

01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:40.584
# I am the summertime #

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:46.215
# And I'm here
to free your mind #

01:31:46.298 --> 01:31:50.344
# Kick off your shoes the blues
and use anything but your mind #

01:31:50.427 --> 01:31:55.015
# 'Cause this is
the summertime #

01:31:55.098 --> 01:32:00.562
# And it's here
to free your mind #

01:32:00.646 --> 01:32:05.484
# How many other people
can you save today #

01:32:05.567 --> 01:32:10.447
# Don't you think it's high time
that you sail away #

01:32:10.489 --> 01:32:15.244
# Leave today
Don't fall behind #

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:19.540
# Try something new, turn into you
if only for a short time #

01:32:19.623 --> 01:32:24.378
# I am the summertime #

01:32:24.419 --> 01:32:29.424
# And I'm here
to free your mind ##

01:32:39.059 --> 01:32:41.311
# Love is tragic
Love is bold #

01:32:41.353 --> 01:32:44.481
# You will always
do what you are told #

01:32:49.319 --> 01:32:51.738
# Love is hard
Love is strong #

01:32:51.822 --> 01:32:54.950
# You will never say
that you were wrong #

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:02.291
# I don't know
when I got bitter #

01:33:02.332 --> 01:33:06.920
# Love is surely better
when it's gone #

01:33:08.964 --> 01:33:11.467
# 'Cause you wanted more #

01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:14.136
# More than I could give #

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:16.472
# More than I could handle #

01:33:16.555 --> 01:33:19.600
# And a life that I can't live #

01:33:19.683 --> 01:33:22.102
# You wanted more #

01:33:22.144 --> 01:33:24.646
# More than I could bear #

01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:27.065
# More than I could offer #

01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:30.694
# And a love that isn't there #

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.500
# Love is color
Love is love #

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:47.711
# Love is never saying
you're too proud #

01:33:52.341 --> 01:33:54.885
# Love is trusting
Love is honest #

01:33:54.968 --> 01:33:58.055
# Love is not a hand
that holds you down #

01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:05.270
# I don't know
when I got bitter #

01:34:05.354 --> 01:34:09.900
# Love is surely better
when it's gone #

01:34:11.944 --> 01:34:14.446
# 'Cause you wanted more #

01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:17.115
# More than I could give #

01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:19.535
# More than I could handle #

01:34:19.618 --> 01:34:22.579
# And a life that I can't live #

01:34:22.663 --> 01:34:25.082
# You wanted more #

01:34:25.123 --> 01:34:27.668
# More than I could bear #

01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:30.129
# More than I could offer #

01:34:30.170 --> 01:34:33.715
# And a love that isn't there #

01:34:37.344 --> 01:34:41.181
# I gotta pick me up
when I am down #

01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:46.436
# I gotta get my feet
back on the ground #

01:34:48.021 --> 01:34:53.026
# I gotta pick me up
when I am down #

01:35:03.579 --> 01:35:05.998
# I don't know
when I got bitter #

01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:10.627
# But love is surely better
when it's gone #

01:35:12.713 --> 01:35:15.257
# 'Cause you wanted more #

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.926
# More than I could give #

01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:20.262
# More than I could handle #

01:35:20.345 --> 01:35:23.390
# And a life that I can't live #

01:35:23.474 --> 01:35:25.851
# You wanted more ##
