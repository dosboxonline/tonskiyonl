WEBVTT

00:11.333 --> 00:14.666
Agatha Harkness.
You have betrayed your coven.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.916
Mother!

00:15.916 --> 00:18.250
[chanting in Latin]

00:18.250 --> 00:19.791
[in English] No!

00:19.791 --> 00:22.125
[screams and gasps]

00:25.500 --> 00:27.875
[witches scream]

00:33.333 --> 00:35.041
[Rio] <i>I'll tell them where to find you.</i>

00:35.041 --> 00:38.125
Who, specifically?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.208
[Rio] <i>The Salem Seven.</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:42.666
Who is this child?

00:42.666 --> 00:45.000
- This is my pet. Say hi, Pet.
- Hi.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.416
Watch your back with Agatha.

00:46.416 --> 00:48.125
I know how people feel about her.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.833
[Jen] <i>She probably wouldn't recognize
her son if he was at her door.</i>

00:50.958 --> 00:53.291
<i>They say no one knows
what happened to him.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:56.583
[Agatha] <i>What if we summon
a backup Green Witch?</i>

00:58.083 --> 00:59.375
- [all gasp and scream]
- Surprise.

00:59.375 --> 01:00.458
[Lilia] <i>We've been cursed.</i>

01:00.458 --> 01:02.625
<i>The only way to end a curse is to face it.</i>

01:03.500 --> 01:04.708
I can kill it.

01:06.291 --> 01:07.916
<i>I feel lighter.</i>

01:08.416 --> 01:10.000
[Agatha] <i>What if we just call a truce?</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:12.791
Agatha? That boy isn't yours.

01:56.916 --> 02:00.666
[Salem Seven witches] Agatha Harkness.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.833
Find her.

02:05.875 --> 02:11.083
Agatha! Find her. Find them.

02:11.666 --> 02:16.500
Agatha Harkness. Agatha Harkness.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.541
[voices whispering indistinctly]

02:33.250 --> 02:34.500
[Lilia gasps]

02:35.958 --> 02:37.875
They're coming. We have to go.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.708
- What?
- The summoning spell.

02:40.708 --> 02:41.791
We left the door open.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.750
What are you talking about?
What did you see?

02:45.333 --> 02:48.041
Go on, Lilia. Tell them.

02:51.958 --> 02:53.916
- The Salem Seven.
- [Jen gasps]

02:54.500 --> 02:55.875
Scary black dresses?

02:57.625 --> 02:59.833
When Agatha killed her original coven...

02:59.833 --> 03:01.125
By stealing their power.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.791
Because her own mother tried
to have her executed.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.875
Are you really defending
a noted serial killer, you creepy lurker?

03:06.875 --> 03:08.833
Come on, someone finish the story.

03:08.833 --> 03:12.958
When Agatha murdered her sister witches,
she spared their young children.

03:12.958 --> 03:17.458
Yeah, and then they became a feral,
hive-minded coven bent on revenge.

03:17.666 --> 03:19.166
[Agatha] Whoa, ah!

03:19.166 --> 03:23.041
The moral of the story, kids,
is always finish what you started.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.666
Also, mercy is overrated.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.750
All right, everybody,
pack up your shit! Let's go!

03:30.958 --> 03:32.208
[wolf bays]

03:32.208 --> 03:33.875
- Oh, jeez!
- That was ahead of us.

03:34.416 --> 03:36.291
- [Salem Seven witch screeches]
- [Lilia screams]

03:36.291 --> 03:37.916
- That's behind us.
- We're trapped.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.250
What about a hexenbesen?

03:42.250 --> 03:43.666
- Horrible idea.
- Absolutely not.

03:43.666 --> 03:45.041
- [Rio] Yeah!
- That's a terrible idea.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.791
- Yes.
- Well, if you're all too cool

03:46.791 --> 03:48.500
for a practical means of escape...

03:48.666 --> 03:50.000
- [witches screech]
- [all gasp]

03:50.000 --> 03:52.458
- No, brooms are great.
- [Jen] No, no, no.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.875
This is so humiliating. Here.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.833
Why does your generation
hate them so much?

03:58.833 --> 04:02.416
[Lilia] Brooms have been co-opted
by the holiday industrial complex

04:02.416 --> 04:05.166
as an absurd emblem of our culture.

04:05.166 --> 04:09.250
Worse yet, they're an obvious symbol
of female domesticity.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.750
And they're basic.

04:12.458 --> 04:18.083
[chanting in Latin]

04:19.500 --> 04:22.625
- [in English] Oh. This is so cute.
- Thank you.

04:22.625 --> 04:23.833
You could have done better.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.291
It's about selflessness, Teen.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.000
Oh, is it? Tell us more.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.791
We fly together or not at all.

04:33.791 --> 04:34.875
[Alice] Hey.

04:37.958 --> 04:40.125
- I get one?
- If you give me one back, yeah.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.750
Yeah. Let me just... Oh!

04:46.416 --> 04:48.000
- All right, come on!
- There you go.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.125
[owl hoots]

04:52.666 --> 04:54.041
Oh, no.

04:55.416 --> 04:58.833
[all gasp and yell]

04:58.833 --> 05:00.666
Get off of him. [grunts]

05:02.208 --> 05:04.916
Teen, hurry! Just finish the ritual!
Finish the ritual!

05:04.916 --> 05:07.625
[both chanting in Latin]

05:07.625 --> 05:09.416
- [in English] We gotta go.
- All right. Let's go.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.833
- You okay?
- All right. Go, go! Okay.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.125
Whoo!

05:13.916 --> 05:15.666
- Wait. How do you do this?
- Keep up, Teen!

05:19.291 --> 05:20.375
[Teen] Okay. You got this.

05:20.875 --> 05:24.250
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:24.250 --> 05:27.083
Try praying to the Divine Mother, kiddo!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.791
[screeches]

05:35.166 --> 05:36.666
We got to get off The Road.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.625
Move!

05:48.791 --> 05:50.291
[exclaims]

05:51.041 --> 05:53.458
[Lilia] This is incredible.

05:54.791 --> 05:56.583
[Lilia laughs]

05:59.833 --> 06:01.833
I haven't done this in centuries.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.208
Why haven't we been doing this all along?

06:22.208 --> 06:24.625
[all exclaim]

06:24.625 --> 06:26.291
What's going on?

06:26.291 --> 06:29.625
It's The Road. It's forcing us down.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.750
- [Alice] We're going to crash...
- [Rio] My God!

06:32.375 --> 06:33.625
[Jen] It won't let us leave!

06:34.000 --> 06:35.875
[screaming]

06:35.875 --> 06:37.333
[laughing]

06:38.166 --> 06:39.708
[Alice] Oh, my God!

06:41.666 --> 06:43.583
[Agatha] Okay. We're okay.

06:46.208 --> 06:47.291
The next trial!

06:54.583 --> 06:56.708
- [screeches]
- [all screaming]

06:56.708 --> 06:57.875
[Teen] Oh, my God!

07:01.958 --> 07:03.000
[Jen] Hurry!

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
[Agatha] Hurry, go, go, go!

07:07.833 --> 07:09.333
[all gasping]

07:13.000 --> 07:14.833
[Agatha groans] Oh, my God!

07:15.958 --> 07:18.625
Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.041
We're okay.

07:27.208 --> 07:30.583
No, we're not! The entire
Halloween aisle's outside waiting for us.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.708
And it doesn't look like
they can get in, does it?

07:35.041 --> 07:38.291
So all we have to do is complete the trial

07:38.291 --> 07:41.791
and continue on
before they can reach us. Okay?

07:42.791 --> 07:45.250
How? Kiss, Marry, Kill?

07:47.166 --> 07:50.333
- My spell book. I can't find it.
- Where'd you have it the last time?

07:51.833 --> 07:52.958
Flying on a broom.

07:52.958 --> 07:55.041
Forget it. You can take
the training wheels off.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.041
Whose trial is this?

08:09.875 --> 08:12.375
[chuckles] Agatha's.

08:15.416 --> 08:16.458
[Teen] How do you know?

08:16.458 --> 08:18.000
A blood moon.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.666
When the veil between the living
and the dead is at its thinnest.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.541
[Teen] Wait. I thought talking to the dead
was your department.

08:26.666 --> 08:30.333
Oh, common misconception.
I read people, I read time.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.583
But talking to spirits was just a con.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.208
And who better to commune with the dead

08:35.208 --> 08:37.666
than someone who's put so many
in the grave?

08:48.583 --> 08:49.583
We have to Ouija.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.458
- [watch alarm beeps]
- [gasps]

08:55.416 --> 08:56.791
It's not a verb.

08:56.791 --> 08:58.416
[Teen] Come on. We have to do this.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.375
Uh, Spanish, Chinese...

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
Ah, English.

09:11.125 --> 09:14.916
Okay. "Number one,
do not use the Ouija board alone.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.208
"Number two,
do not speak over each other."

09:18.208 --> 09:20.000
It's not written there. Show me that.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.250
"Three! Do not taunt the spirits."

09:25.458 --> 09:26.458
What?

09:26.958 --> 09:30.458
I repeat, do not taunt the spirits.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.208
"Four, do not ask about death.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.416
"Five, always end your session
with goodbye.

09:36.416 --> 09:40.958
"Six, do not, under any circumstances,
remove your hand from the planchette.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.333
"If you do so, a spirit will be released."

09:49.250 --> 09:50.500
What does it say on the back?

09:51.750 --> 09:52.833
"For ages three and up."

09:54.583 --> 09:55.666
Okay.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.000
Wonder who's waiting for you.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.291
And with what trauma.

10:05.791 --> 10:10.666
Pff! It could be literally anybody. So...

10:15.875 --> 10:17.250
[clears throat]

10:28.458 --> 10:30.500
Mother, Maiden, Crone,

10:32.208 --> 10:34.208
spirits be known.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.375
I can hear something. Shh!

10:43.416 --> 10:45.583
Oh, my God, I'm not moving it.
Are you moving it?

10:45.583 --> 10:46.875
[shushing]

10:47.666 --> 10:49.666
Is someone here with us

10:51.041 --> 10:53.375
during this Witching Hour?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.125
[Jen] Yes.

11:01.666 --> 11:02.666
All right.

11:02.666 --> 11:03.958
And who,

11:05.125 --> 11:06.166
may I ask,

11:06.916 --> 11:10.083
do we have the pleasure of communing with?

11:13.916 --> 11:16.333
[Teen] M, R,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.625
S, H,

11:21.583 --> 11:22.583
A,

11:23.166 --> 11:25.500
R, T.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.583
[Jen gasps] Mrs. Hart?

11:30.416 --> 11:32.958
Hey, girl, feeling better?

11:33.666 --> 11:35.375
How's your face?

11:35.375 --> 11:36.666
No taunting.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.625
[all gasp]

11:38.625 --> 11:41.291
- Your hands. What did you do?
- I didn't do it!

11:42.541 --> 11:44.541
- Agatha?
- [gasps]

11:45.458 --> 11:46.958
[warbling]

11:52.416 --> 11:53.875
[in Mrs. Hart's voice] Oh, my.

11:55.625 --> 11:57.541
What a journey.

11:59.500 --> 12:04.791
[sighs] There I was,
living my tiny life in the burbs,

12:05.708 --> 12:07.541
baking casseroles,

12:08.375 --> 12:13.041
linking in to conspiracy theories
on Facebook,

12:13.041 --> 12:15.166
drinking before noon,

12:15.166 --> 12:17.291
and there you were

12:18.041 --> 12:20.875
bringing chills and thrills

12:21.916 --> 12:25.791
and bringing on my own early demise!

12:27.333 --> 12:28.916
Listen, Mrs. Hart...

12:28.916 --> 12:31.291
- She's not Mrs. Hart.
- She's Sharon Davis.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.875
I am. I'm Sharon Davis.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.000
- She's Agatha.
- Yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.375
What? [giggles]

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
She's just scared.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.125
[clears throat]

12:44.625 --> 12:45.625
[in normal voice] Okay.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.958
- I thought that was pretty good.
- The clock is ticking.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
[tapping floor]

12:52.583 --> 12:54.041
Fine.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.041
Well, let's get to it. Right?

13:02.291 --> 13:04.083
Maiden, Mother, Crone,

13:07.041 --> 13:08.833
spirits be known.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.750
- [ceiling rustling]
- [all gasping softly]

13:18.500 --> 13:20.208
Who is here with us tonight?

13:20.583 --> 13:21.958
[whooshing]

13:22.333 --> 13:24.500
D, E,

13:25.083 --> 13:27.583
- A, T...
- A, T...

13:28.666 --> 13:30.041
H. Death.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.458
[laughs]

13:32.666 --> 13:35.041
- We're not supposed to ask about death.
- [all shush]

13:37.708 --> 13:38.958
What do you want?

13:40.208 --> 13:46.875
P, U, N, I, S, H.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.333
Punish.

13:54.541 --> 13:55.791
Who do you wanna punish?

13:57.083 --> 14:00.125
[all] A, G, A...

14:00.125 --> 14:03.375
- T, H...
- Stop. All right, stop.

14:04.458 --> 14:08.333
A, G, A, T, H, A.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.958
- Stop. Make it stop!
- A, G, A,

14:09.958 --> 14:12.791
- T, H...
- Stop making it do that!

14:12.791 --> 14:17.250
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
- [others arguing]

14:17.250 --> 14:18.458
I can't!

14:18.458 --> 14:19.916
What are you doing?

14:20.708 --> 14:22.166
[all scream]

14:28.583 --> 14:30.000
- [voices shrieking]
- Make it stop!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.583
I would if I could!

14:31.583 --> 14:34.000
I hated this the first time!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.750
Lilia's being weird again.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.833
What do they want?

14:37.333 --> 14:38.833
They already told us.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.458
Punish Agatha!

14:49.875 --> 14:53.208
Meaning, we need to...

14:55.291 --> 14:56.291
Yup.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.000
It's how we pass the trial.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.625
Uh, I don't think so.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.125
And after everything she's done,

15:04.041 --> 15:10.000
the lies, the cheating,
the complete and utter lack of humanity.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.250
- No, there has to be another way.
- Right. Yes.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.375
- We could tie her up.
- You're not serious.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.416
- I can't...
- Humiliation would work too.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.666
I mean, or we could just slit her throat.

15:21.041 --> 15:23.375
When people ask me
why I don't have female friends...

15:24.416 --> 15:27.791
But we were getting along, weren't we?
We were clicking. There was unity.

15:27.791 --> 15:29.500
Familiars don't get a vote.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.375
[Lilia] What?

15:35.875 --> 15:37.333
Where'd she go?

15:37.333 --> 15:38.541
[all gasp]

15:38.541 --> 15:40.000
Oh, my gosh, what's happening?

15:41.041 --> 15:44.583
Agatha. Let's talk about this
for a minute.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.291
We're sisters in the craft, remember?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
[Alice] We need light.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.500
- [voice breathing heavily]
- Does anyone else hear that?

16:17.791 --> 16:19.458
[all screaming]

16:26.333 --> 16:27.500
She's faking it.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.083
[Alice] Look at her face!

16:29.625 --> 16:31.666
Sweetheart, you okay?

16:32.666 --> 16:33.875
[Teen] Oh, my gosh.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.541
[Alice] Not faking! Not faking!

16:35.541 --> 16:37.250
[Rio] What's she doin'? Where's she goin'?

16:37.250 --> 16:39.375
[Teen] That is not Agatha!

16:39.916 --> 16:43.041
- She's possessed! For real this time!
- [barks]

16:43.041 --> 16:44.166
[Jen] Hey, over here!

16:46.041 --> 16:47.500
- [gasps]
- [Teen] No!

16:51.166 --> 16:52.666
[Alice] Stop it! Let her go!

16:54.083 --> 16:55.875
- What are you doing? You're hurting her.
- [choking]

17:00.250 --> 17:03.583
- [Alice] Jen. Jen. Okay, okay. Where...
- [Rio] Agatha!

17:05.958 --> 17:08.041
Where is she? All right. Where is she?

17:08.791 --> 17:10.541
Agatha!

17:12.958 --> 17:14.458
[all gasping]

17:19.291 --> 17:20.291
What is that?

17:25.833 --> 17:27.958
That is a ghost.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.458
I hate ghosts.

17:31.458 --> 17:32.958
Who... Who are you?

17:33.958 --> 17:37.541
<i>Evanora Harkness of the Salemites.</i>

17:39.541 --> 17:41.250
[Agatha] Hey, Mom.

17:45.958 --> 17:50.041
It was nice having you in my body
for a second there.

17:50.791 --> 17:54.125
I've never felt so close to you before.

17:55.833 --> 17:58.875
<i>My coven risked everything to kill her.</i>

17:59.375 --> 18:02.458
<i>And you fools have willingly joined her.</i>

18:03.208 --> 18:06.375
Stop embarrassing me
in front of my friends, Mom.

18:06.958 --> 18:09.416
So what do we do? Do we banish her?

18:09.416 --> 18:11.458
[Lilia] Emotion ties them to this plane.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.208
They have unfinished business.

18:14.208 --> 18:15.750
So let's finish her business.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.916
- [Jen] Okay.
- [Teen] What do you want?

18:17.916 --> 18:21.541
<i>You must finish the Witches' Road</i>

18:22.208 --> 18:23.875
<i>without Agatha.</i>

18:25.166 --> 18:28.625
She means punish Agatha.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.416
<i>Leave her with me.</i>

18:32.083 --> 18:34.250
No. No way.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.541
A minute ago you were ready
to slit her throat.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.250
Yeah, well, her mother can't have her.

18:46.666 --> 18:47.833
Mom?

19:00.708 --> 19:02.375
Why do you hate me still?

19:04.083 --> 19:05.583
<i>You were born evil.</i>

19:08.416 --> 19:10.833
<i>I ought to have killed you
the moment you left my body.</i>

19:21.375 --> 19:22.541
We have to go.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.375
- Jen.
- No, no.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.041
There's no flood here. There's no fire.

19:28.625 --> 19:33.125
The only danger to us in this trial
is Agatha Harkness.

19:33.958 --> 19:34.958
Please take me with you.

19:35.583 --> 19:39.583
- Don't. Let me. Please. Don't go!
- We can't leave her here. No, no.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.250
Take me with you. Please.

19:41.250 --> 19:44.666
Don't leave me with her.
I can be good. Please!

19:47.250 --> 19:48.250
No, not again!

19:49.666 --> 19:52.125
Leave her alone. [grunts]

19:54.291 --> 19:55.458
- Knight of Wands.
- No!

19:58.291 --> 19:59.791
[groans]

20:04.375 --> 20:06.916
- No!
- [Alice groaning]

20:08.916 --> 20:10.916
[Lilia yells] No!

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Alice!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.708
Just stop! Make her stop!

20:24.333 --> 20:25.333
Who are you?

20:25.333 --> 20:27.958
N, I, C,

20:27.958 --> 20:32.125
H, O, L, A, S, S, C, R, A, T,

20:32.125 --> 20:33.750
C, H.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.958
- Nicholas Scratch.
- [watch beeps]

20:38.375 --> 20:39.500
Nicholas Scratch!

20:42.416 --> 20:45.291
[Nicholas] <i>Mama! Stop.</i>

20:55.750 --> 20:57.541
[watch alarm beeping]

21:07.875 --> 21:11.458
Alice. Alice. Wake up.
Alice, please wake up. Alice!

21:12.666 --> 21:16.791
Alice, come on.
Alice, come on. Wake up, Alice.

21:16.791 --> 21:20.083
Alice, please. Please wake up.
Alice. Wake...

21:20.083 --> 21:21.500
Don't touch her!

21:22.208 --> 21:23.458
She was protecting you.

21:24.750 --> 21:25.791
But you don't deserve it.

21:29.416 --> 21:30.416
I didn't.

21:32.125 --> 21:36.958
[Teen] Come on. Wake up.
Wake up. Alice. Alice.

21:36.958 --> 21:38.750
What can you do?

21:38.750 --> 21:41.000
- Nothing.
- [Teen] What about your panacea?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.458
- It's too late.
- No, it's not!

21:42.458 --> 21:45.041
There's a spell, there's always a spell!

21:45.041 --> 21:48.375
Alice, please wake up.
Alice! Alice! Come on, Alice. Come on.

21:50.583 --> 21:51.625
She's gone.

22:34.041 --> 22:37.250
- Hey! How could you?
- I...

22:37.250 --> 22:41.333
- How could you kill her?
- I couldn't... I couldn't control it.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.750
Yes, you could have. Don't lie to me.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.250
I'm not.

22:46.250 --> 22:47.500
You wanted her power.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.125
That's what this has always been about
for you, isn't it?

22:52.333 --> 22:53.333
[Jen] Of course it is.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.333
That's what all this is about.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.458
For any of us.

23:01.875 --> 23:05.041
Death comes for us all.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.916
That's what it means to be a witch?

23:11.125 --> 23:13.250
Killing people to serve your own agenda?

23:14.291 --> 23:17.083
No. Not for me.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.291
[snickers]

23:37.375 --> 23:39.083
[whispers] Are you sure?

23:53.458 --> 23:56.041
You're so much like your mother.

24:13.166 --> 24:15.666
Come, Pet.

24:23.583 --> 24:25.750
Wait, what are you... Stop!

24:25.750 --> 24:28.458
Wait! Stop! Why are you... What?

24:28.458 --> 24:30.333
Why? What is... Teen, stop!

24:31.250 --> 24:33.625
Stop! Somebody! Let go of me!

24:34.208 --> 24:35.208
[screams]

24:38.125 --> 24:39.833
Wait! Help me!

24:43.041 --> 24:45.416
[screams] Help me! Help me!

24:52.541 --> 24:54.541
- No!
- [both scream]

24:57.166 --> 24:58.625
[Lilia] No! What's happening?

24:58.625 --> 25:01.916
- [Jen screams]
- [Lilia] No, no, no. No, no!

25:13.166 --> 25:15.458
