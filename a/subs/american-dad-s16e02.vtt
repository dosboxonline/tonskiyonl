WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:05.005
So I bit him.

00:05.088 --> 00:08.133
I didn't know what else to do,
so I just bit him.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.844
And I feel like that was the right move

00:10.928 --> 00:13.972
because he never charged me
for the guitar lesson.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.433
Okay! On to other business.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.061
We have an exciting new villain...

00:19.269 --> 00:21.396
Anastasia Kirilenko.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.024
Kirilenko? That sounds Russian.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.319
That's right! The Russians
are doing shit again!

00:29.655 --> 00:32.074
The Russians! They dance like this.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.619
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho! Ha! Hey! Yeah, yeah!

00:35.702 --> 00:37.162
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

00:37.246 --> 00:39.540
Ha-ha! That's right, Styles! They do!

00:39.623 --> 00:42.584
Jackson has painted a fresco
on the ceiling

00:42.668 --> 00:43.961
detailing the mission.

00:44.044 --> 00:48.048
Now, this is for you
visual learners and also for me,

00:48.131 --> 00:50.926
because I got bananas high
before this meeting.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.177
Jackson!

00:52.261 --> 00:55.180
We intercepted an order
from Kirilenko's IP address

00:55.264 --> 00:56.765
to the American Girl doll store...

00:56.849 --> 00:58.016
Oh!

00:58.100 --> 00:59.226
...where Kirilenko's daughter

00:59.309 --> 01:01.603
ordered a special, one-of-a-kind doll.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.021
Hmm!

01:03.105 --> 01:05.107
The plan is
to put a bug in the doll...

01:05.190 --> 01:06.233
- Dude.
- ...and ship it

01:06.316 --> 01:08.318
- to the Kirilenko compound.
- Whoa.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.321
We'll finally be able
to listen in on the Russian mob.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.073
Yeah.

01:13.282 --> 01:18.120
We've coordinated with American Girl,
as we do on most missions,

01:18.203 --> 01:21.373
and they're giving us access
to the doll before it's delivered.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.542
We just need an agent to go to the mall.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.710
-I got it!
-Oh! Me!

01:24.793 --> 01:26.128
I'll do anything to get out of work.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.589
That's what I like to hear!

01:28.672 --> 01:31.383
Pick up the doll.
Bring it to work Monday morning.

01:32.384 --> 01:37.389
I will be busy all weekend,
posing for my deputy director portrait.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.267
Who said you people could go?

01:45.189 --> 01:48.025
Good morning, USA

01:48.108 --> 01:51.570
I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:51.653 --> 01:54.448
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:54.531 --> 01:58.243
And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race

02:00.787 --> 02:03.999
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:04.291 --> 02:06.293
Good morning, USA

02:06.376 --> 02:07.503
Ah!

02:09.046 --> 02:12.090
Good morning, USA

02:13.967 --> 02:17.346
Oh, girl, you need a shot of B12

02:17.429 --> 02:18.805
Break it out!

02:20.265 --> 02:22.809
Steve, why are you hanging
around this old factory?

02:22.893 --> 02:25.604
Uh, this is my high school, Dad.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.357
You just met Mr. Brink
at my parent-teacher conference.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.900
I thought that was your foreman.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.818
No wonder he wouldn't show me
his jackhammer.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.737
Well, punch out and let's go to the mall.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.990
Were you just listening
to the boy band I was in?

02:37.074 --> 02:38.659
Yeah, they've been playing it
a lot recently

02:38.742 --> 02:40.327
since some psychopath's been murdering

02:40.410 --> 02:41.954
all the band members one by one.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.580
I have been getting a lot more calls

02:43.664 --> 02:45.582
that are just heaving breathing lately.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.417
I thought it was Barry.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.839
I'm sorry we have to go
to this lame doll store.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.799
These dolls are amazing.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.636
Did you know each American Girl doll
has a rich historical backstory?

02:57.719 --> 02:58.887
I don't like where this is going.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.723
This is Koko. She's from Hawaii.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.685
"Her aloha spirit kept her family together

03:04.768 --> 03:07.813
"on that fateful December morning in 1941,

03:07.896 --> 03:10.148
"when the bombs fell from the lani."

03:10.232 --> 03:11.817
That's Hawaiian for "sky."

03:11.900 --> 03:16.113
No shit. Steve, you're a boy.
And boys don't play with dolls.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.531
How about Helena?

03:17.614 --> 03:20.993
Her family died of dysentery
during the Civil War.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.787
Dad! Hasn't Helena been through enough?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.456
Look at my foot. It has been put down.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.296
Hi! I'm Bob, and this is
my best friend, Maisie!

03:35.090 --> 03:38.969
Ooh! The one-of-a-kind
Piper special edition!

03:39.052 --> 03:41.180
"You're one lucky boy!"

03:41.263 --> 03:42.598
It's not for him!

03:42.681 --> 03:46.226
Oh! A fellow adult doll enthusiast.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.604
We should get together and play sometime.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.735
From the creators
of Young Sheldon comes...

03:54.818 --> 03:56.445
Even Younger Sheldon.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.030
Yuck. It's just a fetus.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.656
I get out of here through where?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.783
Uh, no, thank you.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.119
Okay.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.872
I just had the tightest dinner
with Jurgen.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.042
We destroyed the Chimdale Ruth's Chris.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.127
What gives, Klaus?
You never have any money.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.670
It was Jurgen's treat.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.007
I did his taxes and got him
a three-figure refund.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.468
I didn't know you did taxes.
Can you help me with mine?

04:19.551 --> 04:22.554
Sure. You thinking standard
or itemized deduction?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.225
Those are the exact types
of questions I'm trying to avoid.

04:26.308 --> 04:29.520
And that's how I know Jackson
is having a jazz party tonight.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.189
Can you believe he didn't
skee-bop-ba-doo-bop-invite me?

04:32.272 --> 04:36.902
Uh-huh. So Dr. Weitzman switched
yours and Jeff's consciousness?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.779
Yeah, Mom. This is me... Hayley.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.863
The crazy thing is...

04:39.947 --> 04:41.657
And this is for couples therapy?

04:41.740 --> 04:42.783
Can we get back to my...

04:42.866 --> 04:45.327
Babe, I think I got your period.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.037
I understand you now.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.290
I just had to walk a mile in your tampon.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.335
No one cares about my problems.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.504
Oh! I forgot you were up there.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.757
Just like Jackson forgot
to invite me to his jazz party.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.592
Or maybe it was on purpose.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.719
This is ridiculous! I'm talking to a doll!

05:08.809 --> 05:10.352
A little dark in there.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.272
Now I see on Instagram

05:13.355 --> 05:15.774
Hooper is having
a bluegrass thing right now!

05:15.858 --> 05:18.151
He wanted me to see it! He tagged me!

05:18.402 --> 05:20.195
I'm acting like a crazy person.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.864
You can't hear me through that box.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.200
Hi.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.205
Good morning USA, Piper.
Whatcha got there?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.958
Oh, right, you're an orphan
from the Depression era

05:33.041 --> 05:35.210
and you write poetry for scraps of food.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.129
These are really good.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.755
Did you squiggle them yourself?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.592
You know, I wrote a poem once, about ham.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.135
But it didn't go very well.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.803
My friend fake-humped me

05:44.887 --> 05:47.222
and then took the ham-carving
position I wanted.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.434
Has that ever happened to you
with your poetry, Piper?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.395
Where's your dad?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.648
And then I saw another guy
last week that was like 6'4"!

05:56.732 --> 05:59.359
I don't know if I'm just lucky
or if it's something about the store,

05:59.443 --> 06:02.279
but I always see
really tall guys at Home Depot.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.202
Smith? Where's the doll?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.078
Oh, my God. I totally forgot I had it.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.455
Senior moment.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.081
I, I think the problem is
that I don't care

06:13.165 --> 06:14.666
about that amazing doll at all.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.918
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.920
Sorry about the, uh,
brain fart!

06:18.003 --> 06:20.464
Good fart noise, Smith!

06:23.383 --> 06:25.093
So, I told our joke at...

06:25.177 --> 06:27.304
at work today, and everybody laughed!

06:30.599 --> 06:33.018
So, you see, these tax write-offs
that you've grouped together,

06:33.101 --> 06:37.105
I spread them over two categories
and saved you $15.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.358
Fifteen dollars? Wow!

06:39.441 --> 06:42.152
I'm gonna have so much change
to take to Nipples and Nickels,

06:42.236 --> 06:44.613
the only strip club
that lets you tip in nickels.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.156
By the way, can I get that in nickels?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.075
They don't make change
at Nipples and Nickels.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.619
Furthermore, I'm recommending you
to everyone.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.288
I, I don't know if I have time
for any more clients!

06:53.372 --> 06:54.748
Raider Dave!

06:54.831 --> 06:57.668
Tax question.
If I beat a man with a tire iron

06:57.751 --> 07:00.254
in the stadium parking lot,
is that deductible?

07:00.337 --> 07:01.880
I'll have to look into it.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.799
If it makes a difference, he started it.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.552
His wife and small children
were wearing Broncos jerseys...

07:06.635 --> 07:07.928
in Denver, no less.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.638
That's Raider country!

07:13.475 --> 07:16.478
Hey, Steve! Agent Styles!

07:16.603 --> 07:18.605
I know your dad's
been out sick for a week,

07:18.689 --> 07:20.732
and clearly you've caught it,
whatever it is,

07:20.816 --> 07:22.568
but I need to get something from him.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.611
Rogu.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.864
Whoa! You sound like shit!

07:29.575 --> 07:32.035
I so treasure these talks with you, Piper.

07:32.119 --> 07:36.665
The world's greatest treasure is found
in the words of friendship.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.002
Wow, Piper! Only you can make
Smash Mouth lyrics

07:40.085 --> 07:42.504
which I assume those were,
sound so beautiful.

07:42.588 --> 07:43.755
Stan?

07:44.339 --> 07:46.466
Styles! What are you doing in Paris?

07:50.095 --> 07:51.513
Okay. Uh, what were we talking about?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.891
Sports cars, right?
My favorite is Lamborghini.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.684
It's so fast.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.811
What the hell is going on with you, Stan?

07:57.895 --> 07:59.062
Okay. Let me explain.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.982
Like most flashbacks,
this one starts in the past.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.276
After my dad left,

08:04.359 --> 08:06.737
my mother had to raise me all on her own.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.322
Without a dad to guide me,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.699
she was afraid I'd turn out too girly.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.242
So she had very strict rules

08:12.326 --> 08:13.744
about what boys could play with.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.995
Ahh!

08:17.748 --> 08:18.916
Ahh!

08:23.921 --> 08:27.049
I thought I told you
to throw out that stupid doll!

08:27.132 --> 08:28.842
But she's my best friend!

08:28.926 --> 08:32.471
Look at my foot. It has been put down.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.847
Ahh!

08:35.474 --> 08:39.102
So I guess that's why I went...
a little overboard with all this.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.605
I've been keeping this inside
for way too long.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.107
But now I've had a breakthrough.
I'm all better!

08:44.191 --> 08:45.234
Just like that?

08:45.317 --> 08:47.653
I guess I'm just super-healthy mentally.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.905
Here. This doll needs to go to Russia.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.866
You have a lovely home.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.953
I guess I should tidy up.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.706
Oh. Huh. Piper left her jacket.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.918
It's overdue

09:03.085 --> 09:04.503
That was B12,

09:04.586 --> 09:06.672
now with only seven surviving members!

09:06.755 --> 09:08.006
Piper needs her jacket!

09:08.090 --> 09:09.758
Ahh!

09:12.594 --> 09:15.681
You can't be trusted with Piper!
You're a terrible driver!

09:18.141 --> 09:19.935
When I saw you'd left your jacket,

09:20.269 --> 09:22.312
I realized you were sending me a message.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.482
You didn't want to go any more
than I wanted you to leave.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.734
It's all true, Stan!

09:28.026 --> 09:31.572
Piper, you're the best doll friend
I've ever had.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.740
I can't let you go
now that I've found you.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.202
Stan, the CIA really wants me
to go to Russia.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.037
They're probably gonna come after me.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.790
If I know the CIA,
they'll be after me, as well.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.542
They'll think this is all my idea.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.085
They don't know anything about friendship.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.170
We need to run.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.172
Yeah. We'll lie low for a few years,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.132
then I'll come back for Francine and Rogu.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.848
Did you have any unusual expenses
this year?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.142
Got a full penis tattoo of Dale Earnhardt.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.268
Totally butchered it.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.103
Looks like Milhouse from The Simpsons.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.731
I accidentally ejaculated
on a Nagel painting

10:05.814 --> 10:07.566
and was forced to purchase it
from the museum.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.067
Neigh!

10:09.151 --> 10:13.322
Did you receive unreported
tip income of $20 or more?

10:13.405 --> 10:15.073
I have no need for a job.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.784
I exchange smoothies for used clothes.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.245
I received a trampoline as a business gift

10:20.329 --> 10:22.539
from a prostitute
I am deeply in love with.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.668
Did you make any...
contributions to a retirement plan?

10:26.752 --> 10:27.794
-No.
-No.

10:27.878 --> 10:28.879
-No.
-No.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.297
No.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.675
And roughly what was your income
this year?

10:33.759 --> 10:36.345
Mama gives me a nickel
if I don't touch myself!

10:36.428 --> 10:38.972
Where were you the night of
the Sadie Hawkins dance haunting?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.390
Ahh!

10:40.474 --> 10:42.100
Ricky Spanish.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.811
Sorry. I couldn't hear you
over the stabbing.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.814
How much did you say you donated
to the Audubon Society?

10:48.190 --> 10:52.694
$17,428.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.660
I'm gonna buy you some sugar cereal,

10:59.743 --> 11:01.411
but it's only because we're on vacation.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.746
Now we have some breaking news.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.998
This just in from Langley Falls, Virginia.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.708
Here's a picture of the suspects,

11:06.792 --> 11:09.169
who are still at large.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.712
Sorry. That just went off.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.548
By the way, that was not me on the TV,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.591
this is a normal doll,
and I'm a normal man.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.928
Now, where do you keep your hair dye,
like, for normal disguises?

11:19.263 --> 11:21.515
Well, Stan, you've done it again.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.017
Your most fiendishly clever disguise yet.

11:24.101 --> 11:27.813
Even my own family would never suspect
that I'm not Barry Manilow.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.902
It's all worth it.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.030
Such a little angel.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.788
Did your... friend not like her eggs?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.665
What are you talking about?
She ate the whole thing.

11:51.587 --> 11:54.590
Let's pay cash.
Don't want the CIA tracking my card.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.884
You're right. No huge tips.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.219
Don't want to end up a segment
on the local news.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.013
Let me just do a quick Yelp review.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.723
I found Stan!

12:04.600 --> 12:06.518
And he's driving west on 68!

12:10.105 --> 12:11.440
What the...

12:16.820 --> 12:18.906
I have access to your memories!

12:21.992 --> 12:23.827
No! She doesn't like it in there!

12:23.994 --> 12:25.913
She's going to Russia, Smith.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.624
And there's nothing you can do about it.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.250
Putting the hose down.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.965
Doll is lost!

12:41.929 --> 12:43.555
What's wrong, Stan?

12:43.639 --> 12:46.600
Oh, Towel Swan, I don't know.
Am I becoming unhinged?

12:46.808 --> 12:48.393
What? No!

12:48.477 --> 12:51.230
You're as hinged as a door, bro.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.856
You need to go find Piper.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.942
But she's halfway to Russia already!

12:55.025 --> 12:59.404
This isn't the Stan I know.
This looks like a crybaby.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.241
I'm not a crybaby! But I'm just one man.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.577
I can't go halfway to Russia
all by myself. I need a team.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.538
Don't worry. We'll help you, Stan.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.544
We'll help Stan, he's our friend

13:13.627 --> 13:14.837
Shut up! Piper's missing!

13:14.920 --> 13:17.297
Sorry. You guys are great.
Don't get me wrong.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.758
But I need you to hang back here
at headquarters

13:19.842 --> 13:21.468
while I put a team together to get her.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.762
Wait. Say that again.

13:23.846 --> 13:27.182
Get a team together... to get her.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.601
Whoa!

13:31.895 --> 13:33.146
I need you for a job,

13:33.230 --> 13:35.732
and word is you've got
the résumé I'm looking for.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.945
Special Forces, black ops,
67 confirmed kills.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.072
I left that life behind.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.950
Then I guess I'll have
to save Piper by myself.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.785
Piper's in trouble?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.204
Well, why the hell didn't you say so?

13:55.919 --> 13:57.504
What took you so long?

14:08.307 --> 14:10.058
I'm in, baby.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.899
We'll bring the sweet tea.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.197
That'll be $6,000.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.456
Hi. I need eight tickets
to Moscow. First class.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.041
Ooh.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.460
We only have seven
first-class seats available.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.520
There. Now that I've framed my poster,

14:54.603 --> 14:57.731
this finally feels like
a grown-up's alcove.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.358
I should have a dinner party.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.485
Klaus Heisler, you're in big trouble!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.028
What? What's this about?

15:03.111 --> 15:05.697
Maynard Butterbean, IRS auditor.

15:05.781 --> 15:09.993
You've been convicted of filing
147 fraudulent tax returns.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.454
Convicted? Don't, don't I get a trial?

15:12.538 --> 15:15.624
A trial? This isn't TV, bro.
You're going to jail!

15:15.791 --> 15:18.877
I, I'll admit, I took a few liberties,
but everyone does it.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.630
This isn't cocaine, sir.
Not everyone does this.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.173
We're seizing all your assets.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.300
Assets? I don't have any...

15:25.551 --> 15:27.010
No!

15:28.387 --> 15:31.265
I spent $700 at Aaron Brothers
getting that framed!

15:31.348 --> 15:32.850
Hit him with the Tasers, boys.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.061
Roger, you jerk.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.313
Are you busy Saturday?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
I'm having a little dinner party.

15:42.526 --> 15:43.735
I'll be there.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.704
There's no dying in baseball.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.623
Emma, you're in a league of your own.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.009
How are we gonna get past them?

16:07.092 --> 16:10.304
Me and Debbie can handle
those cold-blooded Russians.

16:10.512 --> 16:11.930
Hey, boys!

16:18.812 --> 16:20.731
You're a miracle on ice.

16:28.572 --> 16:29.656
Shh!

16:30.115 --> 16:32.576
Bad timing on that squeaky fart.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.786
You're a dead man, Amerikanskiy.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.122
Uh, I think my friend Madison

16:37.206 --> 16:39.291
might have something to say about that.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.044
Oh, yeah!

16:42.127 --> 16:44.004
I'm comin' to get ya!

16:48.634 --> 16:52.179
Your American car is no match
for our Russian wall.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.352
Wow. I thought Russians
were supposed to be tough.

17:02.481 --> 17:06.193
Damn it. I brought seven dolls
but only two bullets.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.736
You're all out of bullets...

17:07.819 --> 17:09.696
all out of dolls...

17:09.780 --> 17:11.698
and all out of luck.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.158
That's where you're wrong.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.744
I don't need luck, because I have Mai.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.204
Get him, Mai!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.587
Russians be trippin'.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.298
Piper! Where are you?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.474
Zoya Kirilenko. Anastasia's daughter.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.562
Oh, Piper, I have had such a tough day.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.773
What's that? Oh, thank you!

17:44.857 --> 17:46.817
You always know just what to say.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.237
Here you are.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.613
I thought I told you

17:51.697 --> 17:53.615
-to throw out that stupid doll!
-But, Mother!

17:53.699 --> 17:56.159
You will run this organization
when I'm gone,

17:56.243 --> 18:00.080
but you'll never be a leader of men
if you play with dolls.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.248
I can do both!

18:01.331 --> 18:04.877
Look at my foot. It has been put down.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.715
Where were you when I farted?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.344
You came back for me!

18:14.511 --> 18:15.929
Of course I did.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.725
I can tell by the look
on your face something's wrong.

18:19.892 --> 18:22.227
According to
the American Girl Feelings Book,

18:22.311 --> 18:23.520
you're concerned about something,

18:23.604 --> 18:26.982
like speaking up in class
or saying hi to the new girl.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.483
What is it, Stan?

18:28.567 --> 18:31.195
Piper, you've filled a hole in my life

18:31.278 --> 18:34.489
that my wife, children, SUV,
and alien never could.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.200
Aww. That's so sweet.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.994
But I can tell there's something
you're not saying.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.748
I've realized there's someone
who needs you more than I do.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.169
Piper! You're back!

18:47.252 --> 18:49.129
Treat her well.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.756
Thank you. I will.

18:50.839 --> 18:54.259
She's got a milk allergy,
so she only drinks Diet Sprite.

18:54.343 --> 18:57.012
And she can't sleep
without her Blake Griffin plushy.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.556
Yeah, I know. It's on her box.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.101
Bye, Piper.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.354
Goodbye, Stan.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.692
Oh. I'm not crazy anymore.

19:10.776 --> 19:11.860
She's all yours.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.905
But what about my mother? She said...

19:14.988 --> 19:17.699
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about your mother anymore.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.414
Imagine. A mother who wouldn't
let her child play with dolls.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.717
Good thing there's not more
than one way to mess up a kid.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.975
-You did it, Smith!
-I know.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.726
Piper has a great new home

19:44.810 --> 19:47.229
with a girl that loves her
just as much as I did.

19:47.312 --> 19:50.065
No, I mean getting the bug
back in the house

19:50.148 --> 19:52.150
and taking out Kirilenko.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.279
Now when the daughter
takes over the organization,

19:55.362 --> 19:57.322
we'll know their every move.

19:57.531 --> 19:58.907
We're getting something!

20:00.659 --> 20:03.203
Can I tell you a secret, Piper?

20:03.745 --> 20:05.080
I believe in mermaids.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.916
This is great intel, Smith!

20:19.261 --> 20:20.512
Steve?

20:21.889 --> 20:23.223
Oh!

20:33.609 --> 20:36.653
Steve, I got you the American
Girl doll you've always wanted!

20:36.737 --> 20:38.655
Oh, Dad, it's okay.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.324
I'm, I'm not really into that anymore.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.743
Son, I've realized I was wrong

20:42.826 --> 20:45.037
when I told you
boys couldn't play with dolls.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.289
So... play away.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.041
And put on this lipstick.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.335
Oh... kay.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.711
Mm.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.756
You're a good dad, Stan.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.551
Bye! Have a great time!
