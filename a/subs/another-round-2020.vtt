00:27.000 --> 00:30.958
What is youth?
A dream

00:31.000 --> 00:36.500
What is love?
The content of the dream

00:36.541 --> 00:39.083
- Ready for the Lake Race?
- Yeah!

00:39.125 --> 00:41.750
3, 2, 1... go!

00:43.916 --> 00:47.708
You must drink a full case
on the race around the lake.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.250
One beer per person
at each bench.

00:57.541 --> 01:01.041
Each team has an umpire
who ensures the case is brought back.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.916
The umpire is not allowed
to drink the beers.

01:07.416 --> 01:11.500
If you vomit as a team,
one minute will be deducted.

01:11.541 --> 01:13.666
Wait, wait...

01:15.500 --> 01:18.958
When you return to the bench,
you drink the last beer.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.791
The winner gets the bottle deposits.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.916
Take it down a notch.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.875
Show some consideration.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.541
Get over here.

02:52.875 --> 02:56.166
A film by
Thomas Vinterberg

03:07.750 --> 03:09.291
They call him Fjonk.

03:09.333 --> 03:13.791
Red hair, Thor's hammer necklace.
It was him and his friend.

03:13.833 --> 03:17.083
- Where did he get the handcuffs?
- We don't know.

03:17.125 --> 03:22.458
But he cuffed the poor ticket inspector
to a rail, and then they partied on.

03:23.291 --> 03:26.750
It's okay to have fun,
but it's gone overboard.

03:26.791 --> 03:32.250
Maybe we should have a zero-alcohol
policy all of next semester.

03:32.291 --> 03:33.666
Right.

03:34.875 --> 03:39.250
- How do they intend to uphold that?
- It's like shutting down the Freetown.

03:40.958 --> 03:44.500
- Sune, you'll do the warm-up today.
- Yes.

03:44.541 --> 03:49.500
- Come.
- Okay. Follow me. Let's go.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.250
Speed it up.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.666
- No cutting corners.
- Right...

04:04.916 --> 04:06.541
Looking good.

04:13.375 --> 04:18.541
Open to the page of

04:24.416 --> 04:29.250
'In Denmark I Was Born'.
Open your books. Come on.

04:30.958 --> 04:34.833
Let's hear how rusty you are.
Yes.

04:35.583 --> 04:42.458
<i>In Denmark I was born,
here my home is...</i>

04:42.500 --> 04:46.083
What is psychology?

04:46.125 --> 04:50.041
Can anyone tell me what psychology is?

04:50.083 --> 04:56.333
Psychology is the scientific study
of human psychological processes -

04:56.375 --> 04:59.541
- which is what we'll work on
the coming year.

04:59.583 --> 05:03.500
Why do we behave, experience
and react as we do?

05:09.541 --> 05:15.791
And the Industrial Age
is the period in world history -

05:15.833 --> 05:19.375
- when Western societies -

05:19.416 --> 05:23.125
- based on
their technological progress -

05:23.166 --> 05:29.958
- started the process that created
the foundation for the modern world.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.541
The invention of new technology...

05:34.583 --> 05:37.750
Excuse me.
Weren't we talking about Churchill?

05:37.791 --> 05:41.750
Yes, that's right.
Let's focus on that.

05:41.791 --> 05:45.166
Churchill, the World War...
let's focus on that.

05:45.208 --> 05:48.583
- World War 2?
- No, World War 1.

05:48.625 --> 05:52.375
And thus... the Industrial Age.

05:53.833 --> 05:58.833
- So, Churchill was First Lord of...
- This has gone bonkers.

06:00.208 --> 06:04.208
Malthe, is there another lesson
you have to attend right now?

06:09.416 --> 06:13.666
- Did you hand in your report?
- Yes.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.625
- Did it feel good?
- It was okay.

06:28.458 --> 06:32.708
Okay, I'm off.
I'm on nights all week.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.958
- Anika?
- See you tomorrow.

06:37.083 --> 06:39.291
Anika...

06:40.666 --> 06:44.750
- Have I become boring?
- What do you mean?

06:45.916 --> 06:48.541
Do you find me boring?

06:48.583 --> 06:52.125
Compared to what?
When you were young or...?

06:52.166 --> 06:54.250
Yes.

07:02.666 --> 07:05.791
You're not the same Martin
I first met.

07:05.833 --> 07:09.375
Right... okay.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.875
Martin?

07:25.916 --> 07:30.125
You have the seniors
in history, right?

07:30.166 --> 07:32.125
Yes.

07:32.166 --> 07:35.833
Uhm, they've tried to reach you
on school-intra.

07:35.875 --> 07:41.125
They want to meet with you.
Are you available this afternoon?

07:41.166 --> 07:43.708
Yes...

07:43.750 --> 07:46.416
Sure, that's fine.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.166
What's it about?

07:49.208 --> 07:51.333
Just talk to them.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.875
Oh, hi. I thought I'd just be meeting
with a couple of you.

08:01.916 --> 08:06.375
We've gathered those of us
who could on such short notice.

08:06.416 --> 08:09.458
Yes... well...

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
So, here I am.

08:13.375 --> 08:17.958
Our children may be called upon
to do an exam in history with you.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
- We need to talk about that.
- Of course.

08:26.291 --> 08:29.250
There's great pressure -

08:29.291 --> 08:33.541
- on the admittance requirements
to the universities they want to attend.

08:33.583 --> 08:38.500
So it's not exactly good news
if they have to take an exam with you.

08:38.541 --> 08:40.666
I see.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.958
I need you to elaborate on that.

08:46.083 --> 08:51.708
It's so uncomfortable to say this...
but a C+ really drags down your average.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.416
It's History A,
so it counts double.

08:56.541 --> 08:59.375
And you seem so indifferent...

09:00.916 --> 09:04.541
No, I'm not indifferent.

09:05.750 --> 09:11.875
It's not easy to learn when you've got
your head stuck in your phone.

09:11.916 --> 09:14.583
Maybe you should...

09:19.791 --> 09:25.208
But I'll take note of it
and try to work something out.

09:26.333 --> 09:31.083
Whether that means another teacher or...

09:31.125 --> 09:33.916
I'd like to say something.

09:33.958 --> 09:37.208
What you said about
the Easter Crisis...

09:37.250 --> 09:40.458
Totally confusing. Right?

09:52.208 --> 09:55.625
Jonas! Please put back the bike
when you borrow it.

09:55.666 --> 09:59.916
- But I didn't. Ask Kasper.
- I never touched it.

10:02.166 --> 10:06.833
- Where are you going?
- To Nikolaj's 40th. Didn't I tell you?

10:06.875 --> 10:10.250
Oh, right.
Fine.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.708
It won't be late.
I'll take the car.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.708
Okay.

10:24.250 --> 10:30.083
- Anika, do you have a minute...
- Look, just stop it. There's pizza.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.166
Just get one out.

10:32.208 --> 10:35.166
- See you.
- See you later.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.833
Bye, Martin!

10:40.375 --> 10:43.458
Okay, I'm off now, boys.

10:44.791 --> 10:46.541
Where are you going?

10:46.583 --> 10:51.833
Out to dinner. Nikolaj's birthday.
Didn't I tell you?

10:51.875 --> 10:54.708
Dunno.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.375
It won't be late.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.833
Mom's on night duty,
and there's pizza in the freezer.

11:02.625 --> 11:06.583
- Hello? Pizza in the freezer.
- Sure.

11:28.041 --> 11:32.333
Tommy?
So, are we leaving?

11:32.375 --> 11:37.791
- Never saw you in a suit before.
- It's from the days with Mette.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.166
The socks, too?

11:40.208 --> 11:44.000
What?
Oh, right. No one'll notice.

11:45.125 --> 11:48.750
How's she doing?
Mette.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.166
Mette?

11:52.791 --> 11:55.041
I don't know.

11:55.083 --> 11:58.166
It has to pee.
It can hardly walk anymore.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.791
There...

12:03.166 --> 12:07.625
There, Laban.
That's right.

12:07.666 --> 12:11.375
Yeah... there.
Have a little pee.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.125
I just need to help it get started.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.458
There, a little pee.

12:20.625 --> 12:23.000
Good boy.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.916
I'm driving. A soda, please.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.958
- No lemon.
- No lemon, very well.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.291
I have a bit of work to do
for tomorrow.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.291
- The rest of us are having bubbles.
- Sounds great.

12:34.333 --> 12:38.083
I have a champagne here from 2013.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.500
There you go, a nice glass for you.

12:41.541 --> 12:45.916
What characterizes this champagne
is the mineral notes.

12:45.958 --> 12:50.791
If you close your eyes,
you'll envision ripe French fields.

12:50.833 --> 12:55.708
- Damn, this is good.
- Draft beer and champagne.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.541
Wait with the beer, okay?

12:57.583 --> 13:01.041
But how are you? You're 40 today!

13:01.083 --> 13:04.875
Okay... How the hell am I?

13:04.916 --> 13:08.666
I can't complain.
I have a beautiful wife -

13:08.708 --> 13:12.416
- I live by the sea,
and she's loaded.

13:12.458 --> 13:17.666
We have three kids who sleep in our bed
and pee on us every night.

13:17.708 --> 13:20.833
- I never sleep anymore.
- Come on...

13:20.875 --> 13:22.583
It's true.

13:22.625 --> 13:26.708
Let's shelf that for a second
and say congratulations and cheers.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.708
- Cheers.
- Martin, this is great.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.833
- Too bad you're so sensible.
- Cheers.

13:31.875 --> 13:35.916
It is, but the question is
what's sensible.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.791
More nonsense from you?

13:38.833 --> 13:41.791
Yes.
I mean, it's not from me as such.

13:41.833 --> 13:46.583
There's this Norwegian philosopher
and psychiatrist, Finn Skårderud...

13:46.625 --> 13:51.708
- You're so lame.
- Look. He thinks it's sensible to drink.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.291
- When you drive?
- All the time.

13:55.333 --> 14:01.083
He claims humans are born with a blood
alcohol content that's 0.05% too low.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.666
- Okay.
- But it's interesting.

14:04.708 --> 14:09.541
Just to be clear... So 0.05%...
How much is 0.05%?

14:09.583 --> 14:15.416
1-2 glasses of wine, and
you should maintain it at that level.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.541
So you should just keep drinking?

14:18.583 --> 14:25.041
Yes. His claim is that
when you have a 0.05% BAC -

14:25.083 --> 14:28.291
- you're more relaxed -

14:28.333 --> 14:31.458
- and poised -

14:31.500 --> 14:35.208
- and musical and open.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.208
More courageous in general.

14:37.250 --> 14:42.458
I could use a little more
self-confidence and spirit.

14:42.500 --> 14:48.791
We all could. And isn't that what
you struggle with at school, Martin?

14:49.625 --> 14:51.916
- What?
- The problem in your class.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.833
Peter mentioned...

14:53.875 --> 14:57.791
I just mentioned the school situation.

14:58.541 --> 14:59.833
Okay.

14:59.875 --> 15:06.208
- Listen, not to stick my nose in...
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

15:06.250 --> 15:11.333
But I don't know...
whether those things are related?

15:15.125 --> 15:21.291
- Those kids just need to behave.
- Totally. A kick in the butt.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.708
- Exactly.
- Martin, you're the man in charge.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.125
Bury them in homework
and assignments and whatnot!

15:28.166 --> 15:31.083
Paper, boom. Curriculum, boom.

15:31.125 --> 15:34.125
Finished off with a talking-to.
They like it.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.875
Right, Nikolaj?

15:38.041 --> 15:43.166
I think it's about something else.
I think it's a bit bigger than that.

15:44.375 --> 15:48.125
I think your problem with the class
is more banal.

15:48.166 --> 15:53.000
I think you lack self-confidence.
And joy.

15:53.041 --> 15:57.083
- I think that's what it's about.
- Okay.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.916
If I may interrupt?
We'll now serve the caviar.

16:00.958 --> 16:05.208
Tonight we will serve
a Baerii caviar.

16:05.250 --> 16:09.291
It's from Northern Europe,
locally harvested in Germany.

16:09.333 --> 16:14.791
- We usually serve a vodka...
- And you'll also do that today.

16:14.833 --> 16:18.250
This vodka would put
a smile on the Tsar's face.

16:18.291 --> 16:22.875
It's an Imperia from Russia,
wheat-fermented and cooled -

16:22.916 --> 16:29.958
- which crystallizes the water, giving
the vodka a velvety and rich texture.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.875
That'll take us above the 0.05%.
Tommy?

16:34.666 --> 16:36.458
- Thank you.
- There you go.

16:36.500 --> 16:40.458
- I'll take the vodka...
- No, leave the bottle!

16:40.500 --> 16:44.125
- Can you feel it...
- Jeez!

16:44.166 --> 16:46.666
It's entering your blood stream.

16:46.708 --> 16:51.375
You feel all warm inside as it spreads.
It has quite a punch.

16:51.416 --> 16:56.750
Martin, come on. Russia was built
by people who drink vodka and drive.

16:56.791 --> 17:01.958
Grab some caviar and vodka.
You can drive home in a couple of hours.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.416
No need to get worked up over that.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.750
Cheers.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.791
- Cheers.
- Listen... This is...

17:10.833 --> 17:14.666
- This is amazing.
- This is great.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.333
I told you! You and your beer.

17:17.375 --> 17:20.583
I prefer draft beer.
What's wrong with that?

17:20.625 --> 17:24.000
Nothing, but it's his 40th...

18:16.958 --> 18:21.208
We've arrived at the main course.
Should we take a look at wines?

18:21.250 --> 18:27.083
Yes, let's. We'll have a really, really,
really good glass of wine for Martin.

18:27.125 --> 18:31.666
I have for you a Jérome Chezeaux,
a friend of the house.

18:31.708 --> 18:34.916
A wine from the Burgundy district.
2011.

18:34.958 --> 18:40.000
And as Robert Parker writes
in his 95-point rating -

18:40.041 --> 18:45.083
- this wine encapsulates
the Burgundy spirit.

18:49.958 --> 18:53.750
Thank you. I think we could use
a refill over there.

18:53.791 --> 18:56.833
- Is it good?
- Very.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.833
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:05.916 --> 19:10.000
Martin, what's up?
What going on?

19:16.833 --> 19:19.375
Not much.

19:23.083 --> 19:27.000
I don't do much.
I don't see many people.

19:29.166 --> 19:33.708
How are you and Anika doing?

19:35.958 --> 19:39.416
She works nights a lot, so...

19:40.625 --> 19:44.333
I don't see her much either.

19:57.250 --> 20:00.666
There, there...
Take it easy, Martin.

20:01.708 --> 20:05.166
I don't know how I ended up like this.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.625
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

20:12.208 --> 20:15.875
- Have you considered someone else?
- No, I haven't.

20:17.791 --> 20:21.833
She is... the mother of my children.

20:21.875 --> 20:27.166
And she looked after my dad
when he died.

20:30.500 --> 20:36.250
The plan was to hold
each other's hands when we get old.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.666
We'll just have to see.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.458
I'm sorry.

20:51.375 --> 20:56.666
Martin, 12 years ago, when I came
to the school, you were a big man -

20:56.708 --> 21:01.041
- heading for a research position.
We were all talking about you.

21:01.083 --> 21:05.208
You had a grant and a PhD
all lined up, damn it!

21:06.500 --> 21:12.000
- You did apply, didn't you?
- No. The kids were little and...

21:12.041 --> 21:16.916
- I already told you all this, Tommy.
- Right. You did.

21:23.041 --> 21:25.833
When I met him,
he was just a little shit.

21:27.416 --> 21:31.416
Roaming the streets in jeans
acting tough as all hell.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.083
- And he took dancing lessons...
- Seriously?

21:36.125 --> 21:41.083
- Dancing lessons? Was it ballet?
- Hey! It was jazz ballet.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.250
- Jazz ballet, give me a fucking break.
- I did.

21:44.291 --> 21:48.041
You took jazz ballet lessons...
So how's that going?

21:48.083 --> 21:51.333
Shut up, some people
take up pottery.

21:51.375 --> 21:57.125
He was out of this world.
It was totally professional.

21:57.166 --> 22:01.708
Hey, hey, hey!
Martin, you're a beautiful man.

22:01.750 --> 22:05.750
And you can dance.
Not bad. Let's see it.

22:05.791 --> 22:09.375
It was crazy when you did the...

22:12.125 --> 22:14.458
Go on, show us.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.458
One time. One.
On the floor.

22:18.500 --> 22:22.166
- Oh, I did my back in.
- Come on, Martin!

22:22.208 --> 22:26.666
- Come on, show us something.
- Tommy, you know all the moves.

22:26.708 --> 22:30.250
- Show it again.
- Do it yourself, man!

22:30.291 --> 22:32.458
What the hell, okay.

22:32.500 --> 22:37.250
It was something like... and down
and like this!

22:37.291 --> 22:42.125
- Boom! Never saw it coming! Thank you.
- Cheers!

22:43.208 --> 22:46.041
Let's go!

22:46.083 --> 22:49.750
- No running!
- Martin, you're lifting...

22:49.791 --> 22:52.666
No running!

22:52.708 --> 22:55.625
- One foot on the ground at all times!
- Like this.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.750
1, 2, 3...

23:02.208 --> 23:06.833
- Hey! I didn't know what it was about!
- Next!

23:06.875 --> 23:12.041
- You're twice his weight!
- Next. Come on.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.041
1, 2, 3...

23:20.000 --> 23:23.833
Get him down!
Get him down!

24:07.708 --> 24:10.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.458
Hello there.

25:22.541 --> 25:26.500
Okay, so I've gone over
the curriculum...

25:29.833 --> 25:34.375
Hello! Concentrate, please.
Good.

25:34.416 --> 25:40.500
I've gone over our curriculum, and we've
been through the historic challenges -

25:40.541 --> 25:43.208
- of the in... indru...

25:44.666 --> 25:46.083
... indrusti...

25:47.041 --> 25:51.666
... caused by the industrialization.

25:51.708 --> 25:55.916
So let's go over
the curriculum together -

25:55.958 --> 25:59.166
- and get an overview of it.

26:05.791 --> 26:07.875
Martin!

26:10.500 --> 26:15.250
Thanks for the other day.
What a night!

26:18.416 --> 26:21.000
What are you doing?

26:21.041 --> 26:22.666
I can't drive.

26:27.875 --> 26:31.583
It was 0.05%, right?
Just wanted to try it out.

26:35.208 --> 26:40.416
- Hi, honey. I'm taking Martin home.<i>
- Why?</i>

26:40.458 --> 26:43.750
- Hi, Amalie.
- He can't drive...

26:44.833 --> 26:48.541
His car's in the shop,
so I'm giving him a lift.

26:48.583 --> 26:52.541
<i>But we need milk,
toilet paper, diapers -</i>

26:52.583 --> 26:57.166
<i>- and straw for the rabbit cage.
Okay?</i>

26:57.208 --> 26:59.666
Copy that.
Kisses, honey. Bye.

27:03.208 --> 27:06.541
- Call the guys.
- I just wanted to try it.

27:06.583 --> 27:10.666
There's a bigger perspective here.
Call Tommy.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.541
We're on our way.

27:13.583 --> 27:17.666
- Because Nikolaj has lost his mind.
- No!

27:17.708 --> 27:22.833
Martin is a brave man who's decided
he wants to do something with his life!

27:22.875 --> 27:25.458
We're coming now.
He hung up.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.416
- What the hell?
- Calm down.

27:28.458 --> 27:34.750
I just took a couple of sips, leaned
back and felt what that was like.

27:34.791 --> 27:39.958
- So let's have a drink?
- No. So how was the class?

27:40.000 --> 27:45.666
Well... I had
some verbal motor challenges.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.416
So basically -

27:49.458 --> 27:54.458
- we're testing out
the Skårderud hypothesis.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.375
- Collecting evidence.
- Exactly.

27:57.416 --> 28:00.708
What if you get so wasted
you can't talk?

28:00.750 --> 28:03.250
I had no problem talking.

28:03.291 --> 28:09.041
We're not the first people in the world
to drink a little alcohol during the day.

28:09.083 --> 28:13.958
Hemingway, for instance, he drank every
day until 8 p.m., and then stopped -

28:14.000 --> 28:18.416
- so that he was fit to write the
next day. And his work was masterful.

28:18.458 --> 28:23.500
So if we're doing this,
I guess that'll be our approach.

28:23.541 --> 28:26.875
I think it's exciting.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.416
So do I.

28:34.416 --> 28:39.125
But we'll write a brilliant
psychological essay about it -

28:39.166 --> 28:42.041
- so that it isn't altogether
foolishness.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.916
- Okay.
- What do we write?

28:45.958 --> 28:49.166
A study of
Finn Skårderud's hypothesis -

28:49.208 --> 28:52.500
- that man is born with
a deficit of 0.05% BAC.

28:52.541 --> 28:56.166
And now what the trial will consist of.

28:56.208 --> 29:02.125
Daily consumption of alcohol
aspiring to uphold a level of 0.05%...

29:02.166 --> 29:06.916
With the aim of collecting evidence
of psychological -

29:06.958 --> 29:10.625
- verbal motor
and psycho-rhetorical effects -

29:10.666 --> 29:16.416
- and study of increased
social and professional performance.

29:16.458 --> 29:20.041
- We only drink during work hours.
- Okay.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.083
It'll have to be.

29:23.125 --> 29:28.041
Like Hemingway. No drinking
after 8 p.m. or during the weekend.

29:37.833 --> 29:40.541
What...
Otto, for God's sake.

29:40.583 --> 29:44.250
Damn it... Otto.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.250
Look! Damn it, Otto. You have
to speak up when you have to pee.

29:50.291 --> 29:55.541
- Mom, I peed!
- Shh! Not now. You'll wake them.

29:55.583 --> 30:00.750
Tell me before you pee. Not after.
And no yelling.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.500
Listen... telling me after...

30:03.541 --> 30:07.041
Why are you yelling?
I've slept all of 20 minutes!

30:07.083 --> 30:12.375
You're waking the whole house. I haven't
slept through the night in 3 years!

30:12.416 --> 30:16.041
- What's that?
- It's piss!

30:16.083 --> 30:21.333
- Why didn't he pee before bedtime?
- What an annoying thing to ask.

30:21.375 --> 30:27.916
- Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
- I intend to. Are you okay, sweetie?

30:29.041 --> 30:33.708
- Nikolaj, breakfast is ready!
- Coming. Start without me.

30:43.250 --> 30:45.541
Nikolaj!

31:10.083 --> 31:15.875
Malthe, put your phone away unless
you want to share it with all of us?

31:15.916 --> 31:19.416
- Uhm, no.
- Fine. Put it away.

31:19.458 --> 31:22.041
And close the door.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.166
We're having a test today.

31:31.208 --> 31:34.291
I'd like to see where we're at.

31:35.875 --> 31:39.708
- Josephine. Isn't your name Josephine?
- Yes.

31:39.750 --> 31:43.500
The rest of you, pay attention.
What I'm about to talk about -

31:43.541 --> 31:48.250
- we've already been through this year,
or last year.

31:56.250 --> 32:02.541
Josse, there's an election with three
candidates, so who do you vote for?

32:02.583 --> 32:06.458
- Do you follow?
- Yes.

32:06.500 --> 32:12.750
Number 1: He is partially paralyzed
from polio. He has hypertension.

32:12.791 --> 32:17.833
He's anemic and suffers from
an array of serious illnesses.

32:17.875 --> 32:24.833
He lies if it suits his purpose and
consults astrologists on his politics.

32:24.875 --> 32:29.666
He cheats on his wife, chain-smokes
and drinks too many martinis.

32:29.708 --> 32:35.333
Number 2: He's overweight,
and he's already lost three elections.

32:35.375 --> 32:39.583
He's had a depression
and two heart attacks.

32:39.625 --> 32:45.458
He's impossible to work with
and smokes cigars non-stop.

32:45.500 --> 32:50.291
And every night when he goes to bed, he
drinks incredible amounts of champagne -

32:50.333 --> 32:55.916
- cognac, port, whisky and adds
two sleeping pills before dozing off.

32:55.958 --> 32:58.833
The last one, number 3:

32:58.875 --> 33:02.833
He's a highly decorated war hero.
He treats women with respect.

33:02.875 --> 33:08.958
He loves animals, never smokes
and only has a beer on rare occasions.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.958
Josse, who do you vote for?

33:13.541 --> 33:17.500
- The last one.
- The last one. Number 3.

33:17.541 --> 33:20.833
- And the rest of you?
- Yes, number 3.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.666
Oh boy! You just discarded...

33:25.791 --> 33:29.041
... Franklin D. Roosevelt.

33:29.083 --> 33:35.708
Winston L. Churchill. And thankfully
you elected this guy.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.458
Hitler?!

33:39.541 --> 33:46.541
Focus! It's funny, but there's a point
to this, which is important -

33:46.583 --> 33:49.958
- and which I hope
you'll understand some day.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.833
The world is never as you expect.

33:55.541 --> 34:00.666
Oh, we'll be busy, but let's see
if we can't make this work.

34:00.708 --> 34:03.458
Jason, page 83.

34:03.500 --> 34:07.083
<i>In Denmark I was born</i>

34:07.125 --> 34:10.583
<i>here my home is</i>

34:11.291 --> 34:15.041
<i>from there my roots...</i>

34:15.083 --> 34:18.333
Stop!
Stop, stop.

34:18.375 --> 34:24.500
It sounds like a Christmas party
at a swinger club. Come on.

34:24.541 --> 34:30.750
Klara, seriously. You sing divinely,
but it's not about me hearing you.

34:30.791 --> 34:34.791
It's about you listening to each other.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.208
Stand up.

34:38.791 --> 34:41.708
Close your eyes.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.541
Try to be completely...

34:48.458 --> 34:50.416
... calm.

34:50.458 --> 34:54.000
And plant your feet -

34:54.041 --> 34:58.625
- solidly on the ground and...

35:07.541 --> 35:11.458
There! Open your eyes.

35:12.666 --> 35:15.500
Good morning.

35:17.416 --> 35:23.291
Now we will sing with our ears,
our hearts, with our souls.

35:24.250 --> 35:28.375
And... hold hands for a second.

35:28.416 --> 35:31.916
Let the energy flow through you.

35:31.958 --> 35:35.291
There. Find the common pulse.

35:35.333 --> 35:38.541
I'll give you the note.

35:41.583 --> 35:46.250
<i>In Denmark I was born</i>

35:46.291 --> 35:50.708
<i>here my home is</i>

35:51.791 --> 35:54.958
<i>from there my roots</i>

35:55.000 --> 36:00.083
<i>and there my world extend.</i>

36:01.083 --> 36:06.833
<i>You windswept Danish strand</i>

36:06.875 --> 36:12.541
<i>where ancient chieftain's barrow</i>

36:12.583 --> 36:17.625
<i>stands close to apple orchard</i>

36:17.666 --> 36:22.125
<i>hop and mallow.</i>

36:22.166 --> 36:27.125
<i>Therefore you I love</i>

36:27.166 --> 36:35.625
<i>Denmark, my native land.</i>

36:47.541 --> 36:51.000
- So?
- There's something to it, huh?

36:51.041 --> 36:56.125
Definitely.
I was thinking you can sniff it.

36:56.166 --> 37:01.375
Then it won't be on your breath,
and I think it'll have greater effect.

37:01.416 --> 37:05.458
I don't know...
Don't forget to take notes.

37:05.500 --> 37:09.208
- Tommy?
- I don't know where he is.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.375
- Nikolaj, where's Tommy?
- He's off today. Coaching youngsters.

37:12.416 --> 37:15.916
Have some water,
and we'll get back to it.

37:17.333 --> 37:20.916
So, Specs, did your parents forget
to give you water again?

37:20.958 --> 37:23.250
Okay.

37:23.291 --> 37:26.041
No, you can't have this.

37:26.083 --> 37:30.208
Hjalte! Come here.
Give Specs a sip.

37:30.250 --> 37:33.958
Why don't you give him a sip?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.958
Listen, Hjalte, if you want to play
in the matches -

37:38.000 --> 37:42.250
- you'll be a good sport
and give Specs a sip.

37:42.291 --> 37:48.750
If I'm to spend my spare time on you
little pissants, you better behave.

37:48.791 --> 37:52.833
Yeah! Spread out, play each other.

37:52.875 --> 37:54.916
Pay attention to each other!

37:56.500 --> 38:01.708
They're hard on you, huh, Specs?
Stay here with me, okay?

38:01.750 --> 38:03.958
Yeah. Take a little break.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.500
Great!

38:06.541 --> 38:08.875
And pass it back. Yes!

38:25.791 --> 38:29.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:29.125 --> 38:33.375
- You're drinking wine?
- I guess I am.

38:33.416 --> 38:37.041
- Did you sleep until now?
- Yes.

38:38.250 --> 38:43.500
- Are the boys home for dinner?
- I don't really know.

38:43.541 --> 38:46.208
I'll make enough for the four of us.

38:49.541 --> 38:54.583
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Wine? Both?

38:54.625 --> 38:58.458
- Coffee, please.
- Coffee.

38:58.500 --> 39:02.416
- Jonas is almost as tall as me.
- Really?

39:02.458 --> 39:06.000
He's missing this much.
Don't tell him.

39:06.041 --> 39:11.041
He'll have to discover it himself.
He'll be out of control.

39:26.375 --> 39:31.625
- Have you talked about fall vacation?
- I think we'll just stay home.

39:31.666 --> 39:37.583
- Those of us who don't have plans.
- Or we could go canoeing.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.291
- What?
- We've always done that.

39:40.333 --> 39:43.791
- Yes, eight years ago.
- Yes! It's been too long.

39:43.833 --> 39:48.708
The fresh air will do the boys good,
and maybe we should... What's up?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.958
Nothing.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
But I could ask you the same thing.
What's up with you?

39:56.041 --> 39:59.625
Nothing.
I just want to go on fall vacation.

40:25.458 --> 40:27.666
I'd better get ready.

41:05.666 --> 41:08.541
Hello?
Hey...

41:09.625 --> 41:12.541
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

41:14.458 --> 41:18.250
- Look what I found.
- What the hell's that?

41:18.291 --> 41:19.958
Booze.

41:20.000 --> 41:25.583
- Where the hell does that come from?
- Beats me.

41:25.625 --> 41:30.250
Not many teachers
have keys to this place.

41:31.500 --> 41:35.208
I may have forgotten to lock up, but...
And there's a newspaper.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.708
Let me see.
Yeah, you're right, dammit.

41:38.750 --> 41:45.291
Someone's been having a nice time.
And look over here. A hip flask.

41:45.333 --> 41:50.333
- Mogens, did you inform the principal?
- No, not yet.

41:50.375 --> 41:53.875
- You didn't?
- No, not yet.

41:53.916 --> 41:56.875
And here's another one.

41:56.916 --> 42:02.000
Have any of you seen students
drinking on the school premises?

42:02.041 --> 42:05.625
During school hours.

42:05.666 --> 42:10.458
Some bottles were found
in the gym depot.

42:10.500 --> 42:15.625
No? I don't assume anyone here has
a problem I should know about?

42:19.041 --> 42:22.458
- Phew!
- I'm sorry about the depot.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.000
I didn't know anyone went there.

42:26.041 --> 42:29.666
- We have to be careful.
- Yeah.

42:32.291 --> 42:35.000
I haven't felt this good in ages.

42:35.041 --> 42:39.250
Something's happening.
Even when I'm sober.

42:40.750 --> 42:46.333
I think there's more to this.
Maybe even going a bit higher.

42:52.916 --> 42:56.083
I think that's exciting.

42:56.125 --> 42:59.500
Peter, nobody found out.

42:59.541 --> 43:04.583
I haven't been teaching this well
in ages.

43:04.625 --> 43:07.750
I just know there's more to it.

43:07.791 --> 43:12.458
Something more unreserved?

43:12.500 --> 43:16.583
Yes. We don't know if we'll react
the same way to the same BAC.

43:16.625 --> 43:19.166
True.

43:19.208 --> 43:24.666
Peter, you love Klaus Heerfordt.
He was a very gifted pianist.

43:24.708 --> 43:27.000
- Put him on, would you?
- Sure.

43:27.041 --> 43:33.666
He could only play at the exact point
of being neither drunk nor sober.

43:33.708 --> 43:36.708
And he was absolutely brilliant.

43:36.750 --> 43:41.333
And you want to take this
to the Tchaikovsky level.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.916
Yes.

43:43.958 --> 43:50.166
But I don't know if we'll all react the
same way to the same BAC. Peter...

43:50.208 --> 43:53.958
- Let's have a drink and find out.
- Easy now.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.750
- Are we or are we not alcoholics?
- We're not alcoholics.

43:58.791 --> 44:03.416
We decide when we want to drink.
An alcoholic can't help himself.

44:03.458 --> 44:08.375
Exactly. I give you Klaus Heerfordt
and one of his drinking buddies.

44:59.541 --> 45:01.375
It's huge.

45:01.416 --> 45:05.458
Well?
What do we write down?

45:05.500 --> 45:07.833
Part 2.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.708
The Individual BAC.

45:10.750 --> 45:17.541
A daily consumption of alcohol
at a variable and individual level -

45:17.583 --> 45:22.666
- in order to achieve optimal
professional and social performance -

45:22.708 --> 45:28.083
- and the ensuing collection of evidence
of psychological -

45:28.125 --> 45:31.791
- and psycho-rhetorical effects.

45:31.833 --> 45:34.541
Who goes first?

46:05.916 --> 46:09.958
Well... That's the question...

46:25.083 --> 46:26.750
Greetings...

46:26.791 --> 46:30.416
... dear, young friends.

46:30.458 --> 46:34.125
I wish all of you a Happy New Year.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.250
See you.

46:39.291 --> 46:41.375
Bye, Martin.

48:05.208 --> 48:08.375
Churchill liked his alcohol...

48:28.208 --> 48:30.458
Thanks.

48:44.208 --> 48:46.125
Whoops!

48:49.583 --> 48:52.583
What the hell is going on?

48:56.416 --> 48:58.708
Mornin'.

49:03.666 --> 49:05.291
Oops.

49:07.916 --> 49:11.041
Martin, are you okay?

49:11.083 --> 49:16.458
I'll handle it.
It's just a nosebleed. There.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.625
Martin, here we go.

49:18.666 --> 49:22.125
- Am I bleeding?
- We'll add some compression.

49:22.166 --> 49:26.625
You're bleeding a bit.
Yeah, there it is.

49:26.666 --> 49:30.541
Just stick it up there. Up.

49:35.250 --> 49:36.958
Cool.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.708
Take that with you.

49:39.750 --> 49:42.833
No worries. He's fine.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.625
Okay, let's do this.

50:00.666 --> 50:06.541
Can you guess what you have in common
with these three gentlemen?

50:07.333 --> 50:11.791
- Girls, too?
- Yes, the girls, too.

50:11.833 --> 50:16.625
And for those of you who've been asleep
for the past 18 years, this is:

50:16.666 --> 50:21.625
General Grant, Ernest Hemingway
and good old Winston Churchill.

50:21.666 --> 50:24.666
What do you have in common with them?

50:25.875 --> 50:30.833
You drink like pigs.
Every week, all year round.

50:30.875 --> 50:35.125
A lot of alcohol, so let me
ask you a few questions.

50:35.166 --> 50:39.750
Jason, you're a feisty one.
How much do you drink in a week?

50:41.375 --> 50:43.333
I don't know.

50:44.458 --> 50:48.000
You can tell me, I won't tell anyone.

50:48.041 --> 50:53.958
National Board of Health recommends
max. 14 units for men and 7 for women.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.708
Jason, Jason, Jason, do you drink more
or less than recommended?

50:58.750 --> 51:03.041
Well... I drink Thursday, Friday
and Saturday...

51:05.333 --> 51:07.083
... and a bit on Sunday.

51:07.125 --> 51:10.125
And Wednesday, if there's
a Champion's League game on.

51:10.166 --> 51:11.625
So how much?

51:11.666 --> 51:17.625
14-15 drinks Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
And 4-5 Sunday and Wednesday.

51:17.666 --> 51:23.458
- So how much is that in a week?
- In a good week 50-55.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.875
- What was that?
- 55.

51:26.916 --> 51:32.416
55. Okay. Caro?
What are the rules of the Lake Race?

51:34.500 --> 51:37.458
- Is the question understood?
- Yes.

51:37.500 --> 51:43.208
You race around the lake and drink
a case of beer against the clock.

51:43.250 --> 51:46.541
- And if you vomit?
- As a team?

51:46.583 --> 51:48.291
There's a rule?

51:48.333 --> 51:51.791
You get a time deduction,
but if you vomit alone...

51:51.833 --> 51:55.375
They add time, got it.
Okay, show of hands.

51:55.416 --> 51:58.875
How many of you take part
in the Lake Race?

51:58.916 --> 52:01.750
Everyone.

52:01.791 --> 52:04.916
I swear, no one could tell.

52:04.958 --> 52:08.750
This is interesting because
we're talking about Churchill -

52:08.791 --> 52:13.333
- and besides writing 37 books
in 58 volumes -

52:13.375 --> 52:17.625
- painting over 500 paintings, receiving
the Nobel Prize in literature -

52:17.666 --> 52:23.500
- and winning WW2 as one of the world's
greatest commanders, he also said:

52:23.541 --> 52:28.250
"I never drink before breakfast."

52:28.291 --> 52:33.083
So, when you run around
totally wasted -

52:33.125 --> 52:38.166
- throwing up in bushes and alleys,
don't feel alone -

52:38.208 --> 52:40.958
- because you're in great company.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.833
Grant, Hemingway and old Winston -

52:44.875 --> 52:50.875
- could kick your ass in the Lake Race.
But the question is:

52:50.916 --> 52:55.458
If you're to take a history exam, which
one of you ambitious youngsters -

52:55.500 --> 52:58.625
- will flunk big time,
and who will pass?

52:58.666 --> 53:03.625
In other words, who will do as
Hemingway and blow his brains out -

53:03.666 --> 53:07.791
- and who will win a world war?

53:17.958 --> 53:21.750
Josse, help me out here.
You know all about D-Day, right?

53:21.791 --> 53:24.708
To the board, go on.

53:26.208 --> 53:30.958
Give me three good reasons
for D-Day's success.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.291
D-Day was the day -

53:34.333 --> 53:38.083
- the Allied Forces
landed on a French beach.

53:38.125 --> 53:43.541
- Yes, where?
- Normandy.

53:43.583 --> 53:47.625
- See you, Martin.
- See you.

53:50.666 --> 53:54.708
I've booked a canoe trip.

53:59.541 --> 54:02.291
Martin?
Martin...

54:05.000 --> 54:09.041
- What level are you at?
- Around 0.1, I think.

54:10.125 --> 54:12.916
Fantastic.

54:21.416 --> 54:25.875
Nooooo :( Said yes to a shift.
Didn't think you meant it

54:29.833 --> 54:32.083
Seriously?

54:35.541 --> 54:38.833
Can't you change it?

54:42.416 --> 54:45.291
See you tomorrow.

55:46.416 --> 55:48.875
Sigrid... the quote.

55:50.708 --> 55:54.250
"To dare is
to lose one's footing momentarily."

55:54.291 --> 55:57.958
"Not to dare is to lose oneself."

55:58.000 --> 55:59.958
Are you ready?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.375
Stand up.

56:02.416 --> 56:07.083
Hand to your heart.
You too, Specs.

56:07.125 --> 56:11.416
<i>A lovely land is ours</i>

56:11.458 --> 56:15.916
<i>with beeches green about her</i>

56:15.958 --> 56:22.458
<i>encircled by the sea
encircled by the sea.</i>

56:22.500 --> 56:25.250
Off you go!

56:26.333 --> 56:27.708
Hjalte!

56:27.750 --> 56:30.500
Boys!
I'm busy over here.

56:30.541 --> 56:33.708
Finish up already!
Hjalte! Finish it!

56:34.458 --> 56:38.708
Goddammit!
Come again.

56:42.416 --> 56:45.291
Pass to Huxi!

56:45.333 --> 56:46.583
Hjalte, nice pass.

56:53.916 --> 56:57.166
Okay, listen up, boys.

56:57.208 --> 57:00.583
Hjalte! Pass the ball to Kasper.

57:00.625 --> 57:04.416
Go on! Run!
Huxi, pass to Bror!

57:04.458 --> 57:08.583
Pass to Specs now!
That's right!

57:08.625 --> 57:11.458
Run, Specs!
Come on!

57:27.125 --> 57:28.833
Awesome!

57:43.333 --> 57:46.083
Tommy!
You're the best coach in the world!

57:48.125 --> 57:51.125
A sliding tackle!

57:51.166 --> 57:54.333
You can totally do
a sliding tackle on this!

57:57.000 --> 58:00.625
- Is that allowed?
- Sliding tackle!

58:00.666 --> 58:03.375
Sliding tackle.

58:04.500 --> 58:08.458
Are you afraid of my sliding tackle?

58:08.500 --> 58:10.500
Take this! Yes!

58:18.541 --> 58:23.583
I wish I had a couple of kids
running around in the garden.

58:25.208 --> 58:27.333
I'd have liked that.

58:28.125 --> 58:33.416
But you get all wound up and start
tidying up whenever you meet a woman.

58:34.250 --> 58:39.166
- Just calm the fuck down.
- That won't get me any kids, Tommy.

58:40.916 --> 58:45.333
You've got your students.
They're gonna remember you forever.

58:45.375 --> 58:50.166
They're gonna forget all about us
the moment they're out the door.

59:03.750 --> 59:06.208
Hi, Sebastian.

59:15.875 --> 59:18.875
Hey. Are you okay?

59:18.916 --> 59:22.083
Yeah, I was just studying.

59:22.125 --> 59:27.708
I may not teach psychology,
but you sure don't look okay.

59:27.750 --> 59:30.083
What's going on?

59:31.666 --> 59:34.291
- Love troubles?
- What?

59:35.958 --> 59:40.666
I've had my heart broken
a couple of times.

59:40.708 --> 59:42.791
Sit down.

59:43.583 --> 59:48.000
- But know this about girls...
- Peter, it's not that.

59:49.750 --> 59:53.083
- What, then?
- All this.

59:56.250 --> 59:59.541
School, homework, grades...

1:00:01.250 --> 1:00:05.958
- I broke down during exams last year.
- You're worried about exams already?

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:09.208
I have to be.
I can't repeat another year.

1:00:09.250 --> 1:00:11.291
Hey...

1:00:15.708 --> 1:00:18.000
It's horrible being here again.

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:25.833
As long as I get a B+ average,
I can get into medical school.

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:29.291
But right now I'll be lucky to pass.

1:00:36.791 --> 1:00:40.666
Ever considered having a drink
before the exam?

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:43.791
- What?
- Just a shot.

1:00:43.833 --> 1:00:48.041
Or maybe two,
to take the edge off your anxiety -

1:00:48.083 --> 1:00:50.166
- and to loosen your tongue.

1:00:50.208 --> 1:00:54.500
I know it sounds crazy,
but I won't tell anyone.

1:00:54.541 --> 1:00:59.666
- Go! We're way too close.
- Come on!

1:00:59.708 --> 1:01:03.541
- Well done, Mom.
- They're falling apart in boat 1.

1:01:04.666 --> 1:01:08.166
- We weren't ready!
- Go, go, go!

1:01:08.833 --> 1:01:13.000
- This is nice.
- That one over there, it's flat.

1:01:13.750 --> 1:01:16.333
- Are we there?
- Sure, just a bit lopsided.

1:01:19.041 --> 1:01:23.958
- Want us to carry some of your load?
- Stop gloating, Martin.

1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.583
Want me to grab the water?

1:01:31.625 --> 1:01:34.000
Put it in here.

1:01:34.041 --> 1:01:36.708
- In here?
- Yes, just...

1:01:36.750 --> 1:01:42.541
Oh no.
I want another partner.

1:01:42.583 --> 1:01:47.833
- Why do you and Mom get the big tent?
- And why are we so deep in the woods?

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:50.625
- Yessir!
- Yes!

1:01:50.666 --> 1:01:54.250
- Does it live in Africa?
- No.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.958
- Does it live in...
- Is it a...

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.541
- Don't skip my turn.
- We're in for a long night.

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:09.583
- Is it a sea cow?
- A what?

1:02:09.625 --> 1:02:13.000
- You're supposed to narrow it down.
- I am.

1:02:13.041 --> 1:02:16.375
Does it live in the Swedish woods?

1:02:18.125 --> 1:02:21.666
- Does it live on the savannah?
- No.

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:24.125
It doesn't live on the savannah.

1:02:24.166 --> 1:02:27.291
If it doesn't live on the savannah
nor in the Swedish woods -

1:02:27.333 --> 1:02:31.000
- it must be a cuckoo.
A cuckoo.

1:02:31.041 --> 1:02:35.583
- A cookie?
- A cuckoo. It's a bird.

1:02:35.625 --> 1:02:37.916
- Is that it?
- No.

1:02:38.833 --> 1:02:42.083
- You're supposed to narrow it down.
- Don't you get it?

1:02:42.125 --> 1:02:45.208
- I get it!
- Does it live in the water?

1:02:45.250 --> 1:02:49.291
Each time I ask,
I have one option less the next time.

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:54.000
So now you're down
to 1,224,000,000 animals.

1:02:54.041 --> 1:02:57.208
- Come on, Kasper.
- A salmon.

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:24.916
What's happening?

1:03:30.375 --> 1:03:32.208
- Are you crying?
- Yes.

1:03:32.250 --> 1:03:34.166
Why?

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:39.291
I think I've missed you, that's all.

1:03:49.833 --> 1:03:51.833
Me too.

1:04:07.875 --> 1:04:10.125
I've missed us.

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.541
For a long time.

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:21.875
Maybe too long.

1:04:43.166 --> 1:04:47.791
What do you have in store for us?
Are we having a drink first?

1:04:47.833 --> 1:04:51.625
I spoke to a senior psychologist
at a leading hospital -

1:04:51.666 --> 1:04:56.375
- about a chapter he entitled
'Harmful Consumption of Alcohol'.

1:04:56.416 --> 1:04:59.083
- For a longer period of time.
- So you want us to stop?

1:04:59.125 --> 1:05:05.125
No. I'd like for us to examine
the entire spectrum of alcohol.

1:05:05.166 --> 1:05:07.750
I mean, if we're to do a report?

1:05:07.791 --> 1:05:10.791
Skårderud talks about 'ignition'.

1:05:10.833 --> 1:05:14.125
After 7-10 units -

1:05:14.166 --> 1:05:18.166
- you either get tired and go home -

1:05:18.208 --> 1:05:23.333
- or you get a restless mouth:
The more you get, the more you want.

1:05:23.375 --> 1:05:26.000
You want to drink anything all the time.

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:30.000
I'd like for us to drink
to the point of ignition...

1:05:30.791 --> 1:05:33.916
... and beyond.

1:05:33.958 --> 1:05:37.833
I'm talking about
the ultimate catharsis.

1:05:37.875 --> 1:05:40.125
Total oblivion.

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:43.500
- I think I'm getting off here, boys.
- Really?

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:48.208
I think it's time to get back
to my family.

1:05:48.250 --> 1:05:50.125
I'm game.

1:05:51.208 --> 1:05:56.583
- What are you up to? Are you drunk?
- No, we're not.

1:05:56.625 --> 1:05:58.333
- Sure?
- Yes.

1:05:58.375 --> 1:06:02.458
We're off to capoeira
and then to my Dad's -

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:06.333
- while you goof off
or whatever the hell you do.

1:06:06.375 --> 1:06:09.291
Remember to shop for tomorrow.
Fresh codfish.

1:06:09.333 --> 1:06:11.500
- Sure.
- Fresh cod.

1:06:11.541 --> 1:06:14.916
Fresh cod it is. Bye, kids.

1:06:14.958 --> 1:06:17.291
Have fun at capoeira.

1:06:18.250 --> 1:06:20.916
- Fresh cod.
- Fresh cod.

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:25.458
- Coming, Tommy?
- Yes.

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:29.708
- Have we got everything? Booze?
- It's all in here.

1:06:29.750 --> 1:06:34.083
We'll start with this.
Peychaud's bitters.

1:06:34.125 --> 1:06:37.166
- Alcohol-free?
- It's all alcohol!

1:06:37.208 --> 1:06:40.541
Seven, eight...
Add four lumps of sugar.

1:06:40.583 --> 1:06:44.750
- Got it.
- Crush them. We need some ice.

1:06:44.791 --> 1:06:48.000
- This is all very elaborate, isn't it?
- No.

1:06:48.041 --> 1:06:50.875
We might as well drink
surgical spirit, then.

1:06:50.916 --> 1:06:56.291
- What are you having?
- Sazerac. 5 cl bourbon, 1 cl absinthe.

1:06:56.333 --> 1:06:59.375
The jazz musicians in New Orleans
created it -

1:06:59.416 --> 1:07:02.166
- to look like a watered-down cocktail.

1:07:02.208 --> 1:07:05.666
But it's <i>pure</i> alcohol.
I mean, it's...

1:07:05.708 --> 1:07:09.708
- Why do you rotate the glass?
- To coat it with absinthe.

1:07:09.750 --> 1:07:12.000
Then add this.

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:17.333
And now for the magic touch.
Hand me the orange.

1:07:17.375 --> 1:07:22.875
You cut off a slice.
The peel contains a fragrant oil.

1:07:22.916 --> 1:07:26.416
- I don't need it.
- Oh yes. Just rub it on the edge.

1:07:26.458 --> 1:07:29.916
- Smell that.
- I'll grab that. Is it all done?

1:07:29.958 --> 1:07:34.333
Hey, wait for the rest of us.
Cheers.

1:07:38.625 --> 1:07:40.458
Holy crap!

1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:43.541
Well, what are we gonna write?

1:07:43.583 --> 1:07:45.541
Part 3.

1:07:49.958 --> 1:07:52.125
The maximum BAC.

1:07:52.166 --> 1:07:57.666
Study of high alcohol intake
aspiring to reach maximum level -

1:07:57.708 --> 1:08:00.416
- with special focus
on observation of -

1:08:00.458 --> 1:08:04.500
- emancipating psychological effects.

1:08:04.541 --> 1:08:07.208
The study is conducted in private -

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:11.375
- to avoid negative interference
from and with the surroundings.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:15.250
- Here's another round.
- Martin, don't you want a drink?

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:18.375
- I'll pass.
- Don't you want a drink?

1:08:18.416 --> 1:08:20.041
There you go.

1:08:24.083 --> 1:08:26.250
- See you.
- Cheers.

1:08:27.708 --> 1:08:32.333
Holy crap.
I've never tasted anything like it.

1:08:33.916 --> 1:08:35.500
Holy crap.

1:08:35.541 --> 1:08:39.416
- It's fucking strong.
- But also, good.

1:08:41.041 --> 1:08:43.458
Are you sure about that, Martin?

1:08:46.166 --> 1:08:47.875
There you go.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.416
Holy crap. What is this?

1:08:52.458 --> 1:08:54.541
Cheers!

1:08:54.583 --> 1:08:56.250
Cheers.

1:09:35.208 --> 1:09:38.125
- How's the dancing?
- Gone to hell.

1:09:38.166 --> 1:09:39.541
Martin!

1:09:45.458 --> 1:09:47.166
There we go.

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:52.125
Cheers!

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.916
Down, down, down.

1:10:29.958 --> 1:10:33.333
- I'm not downing it. Just a swig.
- Cheers.

1:10:34.458 --> 1:10:37.375
We need to go higher.
To the top!

1:10:59.250 --> 1:11:00.375
Martin.

1:11:07.041 --> 1:11:09.583
Where is the fresh codfish?

1:11:09.625 --> 1:11:13.291
I'm afraid we're out of fresh.
We've only got frozen.

1:11:13.333 --> 1:11:16.541
Why haven't you got fresh cod -

1:11:16.583 --> 1:11:21.208
- when all months with an R in them
are cod months?!

1:11:21.250 --> 1:11:23.375
Well, it may be in season...

1:11:23.416 --> 1:11:25.166
Hey! Hello!

1:11:30.250 --> 1:11:32.375
Hey, listen.

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.625
I once caught a cod with
my bare hands. I just grabbed it...

1:11:42.333 --> 1:11:44.833
- It was like...
- There it is.

1:11:47.750 --> 1:11:49.750
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It's right there.

1:11:49.791 --> 1:11:54.250
I'll catch a crab ...
And I'll use the crab to catch the cod.

1:11:54.291 --> 1:11:58.541
We have to stick to the rules.

1:11:58.583 --> 1:12:01.416
Always put on a life jacket.

1:12:01.458 --> 1:12:04.125
Why can't you swim?
You're a gym teacher.

1:12:04.166 --> 1:12:05.541
I teach gym, not...

1:12:05.583 --> 1:12:09.708
- Forget the cod. Let's go out.
- Coming.

1:12:09.750 --> 1:12:12.375
- Come on.
- Coming!

1:12:12.416 --> 1:12:16.833
- Peter!
- Not again!

1:12:16.875 --> 1:12:19.250
Shut up!

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.125
See you in town!

1:12:44.125 --> 1:12:47.708
<i>Oh, what a jolly night!</i>

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:10.875
We gotta eat. Gotta eat.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:13.750
1,000 kroner for some fish 'n' chips.

1:13:13.791 --> 1:13:15.791
2,000... 3,000.

1:13:15.833 --> 1:13:19.083
Take your money. Drop it.

1:13:19.125 --> 1:13:21.791
So I'll eat it.

1:13:21.833 --> 1:13:23.416
Don't do that.

1:13:25.625 --> 1:13:29.500
- Karen, give me 47 47s.
- That's a Christmas beer.

1:13:29.541 --> 1:13:31.333
47 47s!

1:13:31.375 --> 1:13:33.833
- Last round!
- Tommy...

1:13:39.333 --> 1:13:44.291
You've had your fill of beer, dearie.
Good night and sleep tight.

1:13:47.833 --> 1:13:50.708
Last round!

1:13:51.625 --> 1:13:54.458
Get down from there!

1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:58.041
He just wants to show us
his jazz ballet moves.

1:13:58.916 --> 1:14:01.583
Dance...!

1:14:11.250 --> 1:14:13.500
Are you coming?

1:14:21.208 --> 1:14:23.208
Coming?

1:15:26.750 --> 1:15:31.375
Ew, Nikolaj, you just pissed!
Gross!

1:15:31.416 --> 1:15:32.500
Aw!

1:15:32.541 --> 1:15:37.375
- What's happening, Mom?
- Dad just peed in the bed.

1:15:37.416 --> 1:15:41.291
- Ew, that's gross.
- Christ, just how drunk are you?

1:15:41.333 --> 1:15:45.083
Hey, calm down.
Do we even know...

1:15:45.125 --> 1:15:49.750
- Otto pees on me, too.
- You're so far out.

1:15:49.791 --> 1:15:52.416
Let's go watch some TV.

1:15:53.708 --> 1:15:56.291
Is it time to get up? Now?

1:16:00.875 --> 1:16:04.416
- Nikolaj, what are you doing?
- Checking to see if I can drive.

1:16:04.458 --> 1:16:07.791
Drive? That's the baby monitor!

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.125
- Help me get up.
- Hell no.

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:17.208
You're not fit to look
after your kids anymore.

1:16:17.250 --> 1:16:21.416
There, there, sweetie.

1:16:21.458 --> 1:16:25.458
Deal with this mess by yourself.
We're going to my sister's.

1:16:26.666 --> 1:16:28.833
Nikolaj, do you understand?!

1:16:58.500 --> 1:17:02.583
- Hello. It's the neighbor.
- He's bleeding.

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:08.125
- Look, go back in...
- And bring Kenya. Get him up.

1:17:10.833 --> 1:17:13.041
I can't...

1:17:13.083 --> 1:17:16.125
Come on, get up.

1:17:16.166 --> 1:17:18.583
I'll take him from here.

1:17:19.750 --> 1:17:23.875
- Hi, Jonas.
- This isn't our house, Dad.

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:25.625
Let's go home.

1:17:26.458 --> 1:17:30.458
- Just hang on...
- Hey, take it easy.

1:17:32.708 --> 1:17:34.333
Okay.

1:18:18.625 --> 1:18:22.625
You have to explain to the children
what happened, Martin.

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000
Okay.

1:18:29.416 --> 1:18:32.625
Well, I got a little drunk yesterday.

1:18:37.333 --> 1:18:42.458
But Dad, you've been drunk
for a while, haven't you?

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:43.208
Yes.

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:46.625
Everybody knows now, I think.

1:18:52.458 --> 1:18:56.291
- Please go to your rooms.
- But we just sat down.

1:18:56.333 --> 1:18:58.125
Now.

1:19:11.833 --> 1:19:14.833
What's going on, Martin?

1:19:15.541 --> 1:19:18.375
I don't recognize you anymore.

1:19:19.291 --> 1:19:23.375
I haven't recognized you
for a long time.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.541
We don't talk anymore.

1:19:30.666 --> 1:19:35.000
10 minutes on a vacation,
and then you're gone again.

1:19:36.083 --> 1:19:38.541
- Says you.
- Yes.

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:41.583
You've been shutting me out for years.

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:43.666
Okay.

1:19:43.708 --> 1:19:47.750
I couldn't care less
if you drink with your friends.

1:19:47.791 --> 1:19:51.125
That's not the point.

1:19:51.166 --> 1:19:54.791
This entire country drinks
like maniacs anyway.

1:19:55.750 --> 1:20:00.041
Don't you see that our problem is
that you're never really present?

1:20:00.083 --> 1:20:02.583
You're completely invisible!

1:20:04.166 --> 1:20:08.041
And when you have fun,
it's with someone other than me.

1:20:15.958 --> 1:20:20.375
Are you also having fun
with someone other than me?

1:20:21.375 --> 1:20:25.625
Do you have fun
with someone other than me?

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:30.875
Martin, I couldn't just...

1:20:36.458 --> 1:20:40.125
I couldn't just sit here
and wait for you.

1:20:44.041 --> 1:20:46.750
Don't sit here and wait for me.

1:20:46.791 --> 1:20:48.291
Just get out.

1:20:49.125 --> 1:20:51.708
Get out of here.

1:20:53.541 --> 1:20:55.000
Get out.

1:20:55.708 --> 1:20:58.666
Get the hell out of here!

1:20:58.708 --> 1:21:02.750
What the hell are you saying to me?
What are you saying to me?

1:21:05.833 --> 1:21:08.875
Nobody has to wait for me.

1:21:10.958 --> 1:21:13.625
Nobody has to wait for me!

1:22:23.666 --> 1:22:29.916
Study of Skårderud's theory that man is
born with an alcohol level 0.05% too low

1:22:29.958 --> 1:22:32.583
ends here...

1:22:46.041 --> 1:22:50.208
Due to immense,
negative social effects -

1:22:50.250 --> 1:22:52.708
- and danger of ...

1:22:52.750 --> 1:22:56.625
Alcoholism.

1:23:41.375 --> 1:23:46.583
I've called for this extraordinary
meeting on very unpleasant grounds.

1:23:46.625 --> 1:23:50.166
I hope you've had
a nice Christmas break.

1:23:51.333 --> 1:23:54.666
I have received consistent reports
that one or more of the faculty -

1:23:54.708 --> 1:23:59.125
- for some time now have been
consuming alcohol on our premises.

1:23:59.166 --> 1:24:01.791
During the day.

1:24:04.291 --> 1:24:09.500
So far, I've dismissed it
as pure fiction, but I...

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:15.208
- I'm running late...
- But...

1:24:33.041 --> 1:24:35.166
Tommy.

1:24:36.666 --> 1:24:40.125
- Tommy, what's up?
- Just a little tired...

1:24:45.041 --> 1:24:48.666
- Maybe we should...
- I'll sit down here.

1:25:02.458 --> 1:25:07.375
Too many students nowadays
are little boys -

1:25:07.416 --> 1:25:11.500
- struggling to...

1:25:14.125 --> 1:25:17.083
Go ahead... Sorry.

1:25:22.958 --> 1:25:24.291
Tommy!

1:26:19.416 --> 1:26:21.416
Laban.

1:26:24.125 --> 1:26:30.000
Hey, Laban,
did you see who stopped by, huh?

1:26:30.041 --> 1:26:31.458
Damn!

1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:36.416
Give me a hug, old buddy.

1:26:37.916 --> 1:26:42.125
- What the hell... did you clean up?
- Yes.

1:26:42.166 --> 1:26:46.875
- There's some pasta in the fridge.
- Do you want to join me?

1:26:46.916 --> 1:26:51.125
I'll... I'll just set the table.

1:26:52.125 --> 1:26:56.416
- I think I have a couple of cold ones.
- Tommy...

1:26:56.458 --> 1:26:59.875
- Better leave them.
- Yeah, better to leave them.

1:26:59.916 --> 1:27:04.416
That thing at school, what a mess.
I won't do it again.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:08.041
I know I've been spaced out -

1:27:08.083 --> 1:27:11.250
- but boy, it's been fun.

1:27:12.208 --> 1:27:14.333
It did you good.

1:27:15.958 --> 1:27:20.958
You were all fired up
and laid back at the same time.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.833
- How's your back?
- The same.

1:27:24.875 --> 1:27:29.791
It'll get better.
Soon you'll be doing this and this.

1:27:30.958 --> 1:27:33.041
Tommy, take it easy.

1:27:33.791 --> 1:27:38.166
Yeah right.
I'll take it easy.

1:28:01.416 --> 1:28:03.625
But Martin...

1:28:05.958 --> 1:28:08.833
You don't all have to stop by
all the time.

1:28:08.875 --> 1:28:12.125
I'd rather you didn't.

1:28:12.166 --> 1:28:16.416
I've got a handle on things.
I promise to call the school.

1:28:16.458 --> 1:28:18.958
Okay. Fine.

1:28:20.708 --> 1:28:23.083
Let's keep in touch, okay?

1:28:37.333 --> 1:28:39.333
What?

1:28:42.750 --> 1:28:44.708
This isn't worth anything.

1:28:45.625 --> 1:28:47.625
What do you mean?

1:28:49.958 --> 1:28:52.666
You don't want this.

1:28:56.458 --> 1:28:59.833
But I'm rooting for you, Martin.

1:28:59.875 --> 1:29:02.208
And for Anika. You know?

1:29:03.875 --> 1:29:06.541
Martin and Anika.

1:29:08.083 --> 1:29:10.833
It's always been you two.

1:29:11.750 --> 1:29:14.666
And I know you love her, right?

1:29:16.291 --> 1:29:18.875
Chin up, old buddy.

1:29:18.916 --> 1:29:22.541
Promise me that?
That's how I remember you.

1:29:25.583 --> 1:29:27.958
You can do anything.

1:29:28.958 --> 1:29:31.916
Okay. Thanks.

1:29:33.666 --> 1:29:36.416
But keep in touch, okay?

1:30:10.708 --> 1:30:12.000
Hi.

1:30:15.125 --> 1:30:16.833
Well...

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:27.833
Would you like something?

1:30:31.166 --> 1:30:34.541
Hi.
Would you like something to eat?

1:30:34.583 --> 1:30:38.000
Just a glass of white wine
for me, please.

1:30:38.041 --> 1:30:42.125
- The house wine, yes.
- Chilled.

1:30:42.166 --> 1:30:44.500
I'm not hungry.

1:30:48.291 --> 1:30:52.333
Kasper is okay
with two birthday parties.

1:30:53.125 --> 1:30:55.541
- One at your place and one at mine.
- Good.

1:30:55.583 --> 1:30:59.500
- So you could invite your mom.
- I could do that.

1:31:02.750 --> 1:31:06.958
- That is why you wanted to meet, right?
- Yes.

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:10.958
I also wanted to...

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.708
That's good. Fine. Good.

1:31:22.833 --> 1:31:25.083
I miss you.

1:31:25.875 --> 1:31:30.500
- I'd like to...
- One glass of the house white wine.

1:31:35.583 --> 1:31:38.541
- I'd like to apologize.
- Please...

1:31:42.250 --> 1:31:46.166
I haven't been okay for a long time.

1:31:48.208 --> 1:31:51.916
When I look at you now,
I can't help thinking about -

1:31:51.958 --> 1:31:56.958
- how many years I've wasted
on feeling like that. So I apologize.

1:31:58.708 --> 1:32:01.458
You said I'd pushed you away.

1:32:01.500 --> 1:32:04.500
- If that's true, then...
- I can't do this.

1:32:04.541 --> 1:32:08.791
- It's the biggest mistake of my life.
- I can't do this.

1:32:08.833 --> 1:32:12.250
I thought we were going to discuss
Kasper's birthday and practicalities.

1:32:12.291 --> 1:32:14.750
I just want to...

1:32:17.708 --> 1:32:23.333
Talk about Kasper's birthday
or practicalities, or else I'm leaving.

1:32:32.375 --> 1:32:35.750
Can I just say that -

1:32:35.791 --> 1:32:38.916
- I wish we were still together?

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:42.458
Getting on with our lives.
We always could.

1:32:42.500 --> 1:32:45.625
- That's a long time ago.
- No, it isn't.

1:32:45.666 --> 1:32:48.208
Martin, that's a long time ago.

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:55.625
We're not a 100 years old.
I'm right here.

1:32:57.666 --> 1:33:01.041
You're right there looking so beautiful.

1:33:04.291 --> 1:33:07.000
It's not too late.
We have many years.

1:33:10.791 --> 1:33:12.750
Anika...

1:33:14.250 --> 1:33:16.625
And I love you.

1:33:18.083 --> 1:33:20.208
I'm sorry.

1:33:20.250 --> 1:33:22.875
You love me?

1:33:31.250 --> 1:33:32.708
I can't.

1:33:38.083 --> 1:33:40.041
I'm sorry.

1:33:45.666 --> 1:33:47.125
Anika...

1:33:48.416 --> 1:33:51.041
- I have to go now.
- Stay.

1:33:53.250 --> 1:33:55.791
Can't you wait a bit?

1:33:57.166 --> 1:33:59.625
Can I have my coat, please?

1:34:19.333 --> 1:34:23.083
- Good morning, Martin.
- Good morning.

1:34:36.166 --> 1:34:39.333
So, you have a history exam.

1:34:42.041 --> 1:34:43.208
Well...

1:34:44.250 --> 1:34:48.250
I can't give you anymore,
but then we have...

1:34:48.291 --> 1:34:52.041
We have covered some stuff.

1:34:52.833 --> 1:34:57.208
- Some stuff? Why do you say that?
- What do you mean?

1:34:57.250 --> 1:35:02.000
- Haven't we covered everything?
- Sure.

1:35:03.416 --> 1:35:06.083
It's like you changed gears.

1:35:07.083 --> 1:35:09.541
Yeah, I guess I did.

1:35:09.583 --> 1:35:11.458
We're totally ready.

1:35:14.291 --> 1:35:16.083
Okay.

1:35:16.125 --> 1:35:18.208
Thanks, Malthe.

1:35:19.125 --> 1:35:21.250
I'm glad to hear it.

1:35:22.291 --> 1:35:27.000
Well, happy studying.
And good luck with the exam.

1:35:28.625 --> 1:35:31.333
Sebastian, you're next.

1:35:39.958 --> 1:35:42.500
Pick a number, please.

1:35:44.291 --> 1:35:47.583
- What number did you get?
- Three.

1:35:49.291 --> 1:35:54.291
Sebastian. You didn't get
your topic. It's Kierkegaard.

1:35:54.333 --> 1:35:57.500
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

1:35:57.541 --> 1:36:02.041
- No.
- Stop it. You'll do great.

1:36:03.833 --> 1:36:07.125
- Do you remember anything?
- Not a thing.

1:36:07.166 --> 1:36:08.791
You're tensing up.

1:36:17.041 --> 1:36:20.583
- Drink this.
- I thought you quit.

1:36:20.625 --> 1:36:24.666
Go on, take a swig.
But don't make a habit of it.

1:36:25.666 --> 1:36:28.791
Have another swig.

1:36:29.541 --> 1:36:31.791
Give me some, too.

1:36:35.583 --> 1:36:38.083
Damn. It's force majeure.

1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:45.125
A human being,
according to Kierkegaard -

1:36:45.166 --> 1:36:51.333
- is a synthesis
of the spirit and the body.

1:36:57.083 --> 1:37:00.208
Sebastian, have a sip of water.

1:37:00.250 --> 1:37:03.250
Just to collect your thoughts.

1:37:20.583 --> 1:37:23.958
The concept of anxiety, was it?

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.125
Well, Kierkegaard's concept of anxiety
illustrates -

1:37:30.166 --> 1:37:36.875
- how a human being deals
with the notion of failing.

1:37:36.916 --> 1:37:41.583
- And even more importantly?
- With having failed.

1:37:41.625 --> 1:37:45.958
You must accept yourself as fallible -

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.833
- in order to love others and life.

1:37:49.875 --> 1:37:53.250
Sebastian, can you give us an example?

1:37:54.083 --> 1:37:57.541
Yes. I myself have failed.

1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:05.333
Down you go.

1:38:06.250 --> 1:38:09.000
Come here, Laban.

1:38:36.083 --> 1:38:41.958
<i>I love this variegated world</i>

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:47.000
<i>despite its need and strife</i>

1:38:47.958 --> 1:38:53.750
<i>to me the Earth is beautiful</i>

1:38:53.791 --> 1:38:58.250
<i>as back in the patriarchs' time.</i>

1:38:59.791 --> 1:39:05.916
<i>I have cried like others from pain</i>

1:39:05.958 --> 1:39:10.458
<i>because my bubble burst...</i>

1:39:11.166 --> 1:39:13.791
You got a B.

1:39:13.833 --> 1:39:17.416
<i>But the bubble isn't the world</i>

1:39:17.458 --> 1:39:22.541
<i>it's not the world that's curst.</i>

1:39:24.083 --> 1:39:26.375
Well done, Sebastian.

1:39:28.041 --> 1:39:32.458
Congratulations.
Now get out there and party.

1:39:35.333 --> 1:39:41.208
<i>If we had nothing to fight for</i>

1:39:41.250 --> 1:39:47.583
<i>what would then you and I be?</i>

1:39:47.625 --> 1:39:53.208
<i>And that's why I love this world</i>

1:39:53.250 --> 1:39:59.000
<i>despite its need and strife</i>

1:39:59.041 --> 1:40:04.875
<i>to me the Earth is beautiful</i>

1:40:04.916 --> 1:40:10.000
<i>as it was at creation's time.</i>

1:41:25.833 --> 1:41:28.208
- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Peter.

1:41:30.416 --> 1:41:33.416
- Let's... I mean, as we're pallbearers.
- Right.

1:43:00.708 --> 1:43:05.416
<i>A lovely land is ours</i>

1:43:05.458 --> 1:43:09.958
<i>with beeches green about her</i>

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:18.000
<i>encircled by the sea,
encircled by the sea.</i>

1:43:18.041 --> 1:43:22.583
<i>Her hills and vales are manifold.</i>

1:43:22.625 --> 1:43:27.583
<i>Her name, of old, is Denmark</i>

1:43:27.625 --> 1:43:31.250
<i>and she is Freya's home</i>

1:43:31.291 --> 1:43:34.916
<i>and she is Freya's home.</i>

1:44:31.166 --> 1:44:32.958
To Tommy.

1:44:47.916 --> 1:44:50.875
What would Tommy have done now?

1:45:13.333 --> 1:45:15.541
Hi. I've spoken to Kasper.

1:45:16.666 --> 1:45:19.208
- A table for three?
- Thanks.

1:45:20.666 --> 1:45:25.875
- Would you like to start with a drink?
- Well...

1:45:25.916 --> 1:45:28.125
A drink?

1:45:29.250 --> 1:45:32.541
I need a Juvé y Camps.

1:45:47.458 --> 1:45:50.166
- How are you doing?
- Well...

1:45:51.208 --> 1:45:54.208
I think a lot about that guy.

1:46:05.708 --> 1:46:09.291
How are things at home?
Has the dust settled?

1:46:09.333 --> 1:46:11.166
- I think so.
- Great.

1:46:11.208 --> 1:46:15.458
It's like we have
a new kind of connection.

1:46:15.500 --> 1:46:20.875
Really? Did the kids move out? Or
are they sleeping through the night now?

1:46:20.916 --> 1:46:24.375
Well, it helps
that I've stopped wetting the bed.

1:46:24.416 --> 1:46:28.000
It's the little things
that make all the difference.

1:46:28.041 --> 1:46:30.416
Good tip.

1:46:30.458 --> 1:46:33.041
I think we're doing fine.

1:46:33.083 --> 1:46:38.250
Even Amalie has finally admitted -

1:46:38.291 --> 1:46:42.583
- that we've come a long way.

1:46:42.625 --> 1:46:46.208
... I miss you too

1:46:47.625 --> 1:46:52.333
- I'll have some more shrimps.
- Why do shrimps have roe, anyway?

1:46:52.375 --> 1:46:56.416
- Nobody likes it.
- I could live on roe.

1:46:57.166 --> 1:47:01.500
- Are you scared of getting fat?
- Not at all.

1:47:01.541 --> 1:47:07.083
After three dinner dates with that
woman, you're all cocky. Did you hear?

1:47:07.125 --> 1:47:10.625
- Peter's dating some broad.
- Who?

1:47:10.666 --> 1:47:13.166
- Did you go to the Christmas bash?
- Yes.

1:47:13.208 --> 1:47:15.916
She was interested in church modes.

1:47:15.958 --> 1:47:20.291
So I took her to the woodwork room
and put her in a clamp -

1:47:20.333 --> 1:47:25.083
- and then I gave her
a bit of the old D sharp...

1:47:25.125 --> 1:47:27.625
You're so lame!

1:47:27.666 --> 1:47:30.916
It's that little pottery sub,
you know.

1:47:30.958 --> 1:47:35.583
Pottery?!
She's a skilled art teacher.

1:47:36.875 --> 1:47:38.750
But she is.

1:47:38.791 --> 1:47:42.583
- Why do you call her little?
- She is little.

1:47:43.708 --> 1:47:46.458
A lot...

1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:49.666
My mouth is so dry
I could sandblast a bike.

1:47:49.708 --> 1:47:53.791
Waiter!
We'd like the wine list.

1:47:58.375 --> 1:48:00.416
There come the graduates.

1:48:00.458 --> 1:48:04.083
You're right!
There come our graduates!

1:48:06.583 --> 1:48:09.125
Congratulations!

1:48:23.500 --> 1:48:28.625
I think Tommy is rooting for you and me.

1:48:40.375 --> 1:48:44.000
Me too...

1:49:05.583 --> 1:49:07.000
Cheers!

1:49:26.916 --> 1:49:29.125
What are you doing?!

1:49:42.250 --> 1:49:44.916
Did you see them throwing me
into the air?

1:49:44.958 --> 1:49:47.500
They threw me into the air.

1:49:51.291 --> 1:49:54.625
Down! Down! Down!

1:50:09.875 --> 1:50:11.833
Martin.

1:50:12.958 --> 1:50:16.708
Now is the time.
Let's dance! Come on.

1:50:17.166 --> 1:50:21.833
Now! Show me the old moves.
