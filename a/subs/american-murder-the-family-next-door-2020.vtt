03:46.666 --> 03:49.133
She had a doctor's appointment
this morning at 9:00,

03:49.200 --> 03:51.066
and she didn't go
to the doctor's appointment.

03:54.866 --> 03:57.200
You can't get in the house
unless you see signs of...

04:17.133 --> 04:18.500
Why? What's going on?

04:29.400 --> 04:30.833
Is there a key code, Sandi,

04:30.900 --> 04:33.000
to open the garage from the outside?

04:39.466 --> 04:42.133
<i>Frank, what's the key code of the garage?</i>

04:42.833 --> 04:45.300
<i>Shanann's house. The cops are there.</i>

04:51.966 --> 04:53.400
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:57.133 --> 05:00.133
<i>He told me Shanann</i>
<i>was at a girlfriend's house.</i>

05:03.733 --> 05:04.933
<i>He didn't say.</i>

05:39.900 --> 05:41.433
Can we go in the house?

05:47.600 --> 05:50.866
<i>Nicky, I'm giving you permission</i>
<i>to walk into my daughter's house.</i>

05:52.300 --> 05:53.566
Oh, yeah.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.133
I'm checking the house, with consent.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.100
They're across country, North Carolina.

06:21.533 --> 06:23.100
Yeah, so that's not happening.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.166
All the girls' blankies are gone.

06:33.566 --> 06:36.000
Their blankies they sleep with.
They don't leave anywhere without them.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.466
-Her phone.
-Her phone's here?

06:48.533 --> 06:49.933
Her phone's here.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.166
She works and this is her lifeline.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.400
When that thing turns back on,
it's going to start blowing up.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.333
So, that's 1... 31... 8... 19.

07:34.733 --> 07:37.466
She works at a direct sales
company called Thrive.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.900
She got in a car wreck,
and they believe that's what happened.

09:22.966 --> 09:26.133
But Imitrex is something
she takes for migraines.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.200
She took more Imitrex this
last month than she ever had before,

09:29.266 --> 09:31.700
but that's because she was
in North Carolina with the humidity

09:31.766 --> 09:34.933
and everything like that. She was there
for six weeks, and we got back...

09:36.166 --> 09:40.633
Monday or Tuesday, and then
she flew out to Arizona Friday morning.

09:41.166 --> 09:44.566
And then she got back
last night... about 2:00 a.m.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.433
Flight got delayed. She left about 11:00.
She got here at 2:00.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.266
I went to work
this morning about 5:15, 5:30.

09:54.733 --> 09:56.466
I work at oil and gas, Anadarko.

09:57.666 --> 09:58.733
Operator.

10:10.366 --> 10:11.566
Her wedding ring's here?

10:13.500 --> 10:16.366
It was on the nightstand
next to her side of the bed.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.366
No.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.633
I don't know what I should do right now.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.866
Should I drive around, like,
the normal route that she would be?

12:14.600 --> 12:18.166
Neighbor over there said he has
a camera that sees out into the street.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.200
Any motion event that happens, I got.

12:33.266 --> 12:36.833
But I get cars driving
from this street, from this street.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.233
This is him at 5:17.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.200
I usually park out there on the side
until I can get everything back in.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.866
Be easier to lugging everything out there,
all the tools that I had to bring in.

12:56.366 --> 13:00.033
'Cause if there is any sort of action
out there, I would have got it.

13:00.100 --> 13:03.000
I've got issues the other week

13:03.066 --> 13:06.966
when people were stealing stuff
out of garages and stuff like that.

13:07.033 --> 13:10.533
-And I had to park my truck--
-I have you parked right here.

13:10.833 --> 13:14.433
I could see if someone tried
to jimmy with a flathead screwdriver.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.700
-Over there.
-Yeah, I've got nothing.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.333
She's pregnant as well.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.033
Fourteen, fifteen weeks.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.766
Belly... a baby.

14:32.966 --> 14:34.133
It is in my belly.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.366
He's not acting right at all.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.200
He's never fidgety. He's never...

16:05.233 --> 16:07.800
rocking back and forth. And if you look...

16:11.766 --> 16:14.500
He never loads his stuff
in and out of the garage, ever.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.433
He's normally... You can ask them.
He's normally quiet, real subdued.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.766
He never talks. So, the fact that
he's over here blabbing his mouth

16:24.833 --> 16:27.233
makes me kind of suspicious of something.

16:30.100 --> 16:30.966
Oh, I agree.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.733
You know, anyone's gonna be nervous.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.066
You don't know what to do.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.700
<i>Yeah, this is Chris Watts.</i>

20:05.500 --> 20:09.466
Mostly because we don't want the dogs
to get confused with all the scents.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.900
Can you give me your first and last name?

20:39.733 --> 20:41.600
Do you think she just took off?

20:58.900 --> 21:01.633
This might be a tough question, but did...

21:02.300 --> 21:04.800
did you guys get
into an argument before she left?

21:33.766 --> 21:34.900
Do you want this shut?

21:37.266 --> 21:40.000
-Do you have a preference?
-It doesn't matter to me.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.633
All right, let's do this.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.333
You mentioned that
there was a hard conversation

21:49.400 --> 21:51.700
the two of you had about your marriage?

26:34.133 --> 26:38.666
There was an incident where she had
some ice cream that CeCe couldn't have.

26:38.733 --> 26:40.500
That kind of drove Shanann to where, like,

26:40.566 --> 26:42.466
"All right,
they can't come over ever again

26:42.533 --> 26:46.966
if you're gonna have this in this house."
And that's why that happened.

26:47.033 --> 26:47.966
l was hurt.

26:48.033 --> 26:51.500
I wanted my parents
to see their grandbabies.

27:11.333 --> 27:14.966
Does your gut tell you that
Shanann and the kids walked out,

27:15.033 --> 27:16.366
or that they were taken out?

27:17.400 --> 27:21.300
At first, I really thought maybe
she was just at somebody's house,

27:21.366 --> 27:22.766
just decompressing.

27:23.300 --> 27:28.466
Yeah, but after today, like,
with the onslaught of all the cars,

27:28.533 --> 27:31.600
I mean, all the police cars,
all the news, all the K-9 units,

27:33.233 --> 27:36.933
it's making me lean the other direction
about someone took her.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.033
But, this is...

27:40.333 --> 27:43.866
If someone took her, it would have
to have been someone she knew,

27:45.133 --> 27:49.400
because there's no sign of anything,
like, being disturbed or broken.

27:50.266 --> 27:51.933
And it's freaking me out.

29:43.866 --> 29:46.200
My mom just never
thought she was good enough.

29:46.266 --> 29:48.733
So then, what was the blow up
at the wedding about?

29:49.466 --> 29:53.566
It was just my mom and pretty much
my sister just...

29:53.966 --> 29:55.100
just didn't like her.

29:55.666 --> 29:59.733
They just thought that Shanann
had taken me away from them

29:59.800 --> 30:01.366
and moved me out to Colorado.

31:16.833 --> 31:21.000
Is there anyone that you think
that maybe your wife got close with?

31:22.133 --> 31:26.233
If she did, it was very, like,
secretive then, if that was the case.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.533
'Cause I had no inkling.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.666
It wasn't even a suspicion.

31:32.166 --> 31:34.400
Not one guy? Or girl!

31:34.466 --> 31:38.100
I'm... if that was the case,
I didn't have one suspicion about it.

31:38.166 --> 31:40.166
Like, if it happened...

31:41.000 --> 31:42.300
it wasn't even like...

31:43.300 --> 31:44.233
I wasn't aware.

31:45.266 --> 31:47.133
-Now, let's talk about you.
-Okay.

31:47.666 --> 31:50.233
I see pictures of you
from a few years ago,

31:50.300 --> 31:52.633
and I see you standing before me now.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.700
-Okay.
-You've gotten pretty fit.

31:55.333 --> 31:59.966
You can imagine when guys start cheating
or want to cheat, that's what happens.

32:00.033 --> 32:03.266
-So, tell me about it.
-I did not cheat on my wife.

32:04.133 --> 32:06.933
-I went from 245 pounds to about--
-You were 245?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.033
-I was 245 pounds.
-Jeez, you look great, man.

32:09.100 --> 32:12.533
Thank you. I'm 185, 180 right now.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.300
And I've got to imagine that maybe
there was a girl that inspired that.

32:18.366 --> 32:21.333
No. I have never cheated on my wife.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.666
Okay. You know that we have to get
to the bottom of this.

32:24.733 --> 32:26.033
-You know that.
-Yeah.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.566
-Would you take a polygraph?
-Sure.

36:05.966 --> 36:07.433
Do they think she's in the area?

38:46.900 --> 38:50.300
Shanann and the kids were
in North Carolina to see my family,

38:50.366 --> 38:52.633
and obviously her family,
and just kind of, like...

38:52.700 --> 38:54.733
'Cause they hadn't seen
the kids in a while.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.300
And I was here
just going to work and working out

38:58.366 --> 39:00.133
and just keeping the house up.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.000
My flight was July 31st.

40:14.066 --> 40:17.866
And I flew out there for a week,
so I could fly back with them.

43:57.566 --> 44:01.866
So I brought Graham in here 'cause we want
to talk to you about the results, okay?

44:06.300 --> 44:10.066
So, um, it is completely clear that you
were not honest during the testing,

44:10.133 --> 44:11.933
and I think you already know that.

44:12.500 --> 44:14.600
You did not pass the polygraph test.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.400
So now we need to talk about
what actually happened,

44:18.466 --> 44:21.066
and I feel like
you're probably ready to do that.

44:21.766 --> 44:25.066
I didn't lie to you on that polygraph,
I promise.

44:25.666 --> 44:26.966
-Chris--
-I'm... I'm not...

44:27.033 --> 44:28.200
Chris, stop.

44:28.266 --> 44:30.166
-It's time.
-I'm...

44:30.233 --> 44:32.200
Just stop for a minute,
take a deep breath.

48:23.400 --> 48:26.133
<i>Today's date is August 15, 2018.</i>

48:26.200 --> 48:29.033
<i>Interviewing, uh... Nichol Kessinger.</i>

48:29.900 --> 48:32.133
<i>There's a whole bunch of us</i>
<i>working on this,</i>

48:32.200 --> 48:34.000
<i>and we will until we resolve it.</i>

48:34.066 --> 48:37.166
<i>He has no idea that I'm talking</i>
<i>to you guys. Nobody does!</i>

48:37.233 --> 48:38.900
<i>I think he's a really good guy,</i>

48:38.966 --> 48:42.966
<i>and, y'know, I'm worried</i>
<i>about his wife and kids.</i>

48:43.033 --> 48:45.100
<i>And we appreciate any insight.</i>

48:45.266 --> 48:48.866
<i>So, I met Chris at work,</i>

48:48.933 --> 48:51.233
<i>probably around the beginning of June.</i>

48:52.500 --> 48:55.866
<i>And he informed me</i>
<i>that he did have two daughters.</i>

48:55.933 --> 48:59.900
<i>Um, he also told me</i>
<i>that he was currently in the process</i>

48:59.966 --> 49:02.333
<i>of a separation from his wife,</i>

49:02.400 --> 49:03.700
<i>and that's how it started.</i>

49:03.766 --> 49:04.933
<i>Sure, okay,</i>

49:05.000 --> 49:08.066
<i>and then did your relationship develop</i>
<i>beyond friendship?</i>

49:09.366 --> 49:10.200
<i>Yes.</i>

49:12.333 --> 49:13.900
You're so damn sexy.

49:31.866 --> 49:35.233
<i>One thing I did wanna</i>
<i>let you guys know is that</i> <i>I...</i>

49:35.300 --> 49:38.066
<i>found out that she is 15 weeks pregnant.</i>

49:38.866 --> 49:40.166
<i>I did not know that!</i>

49:40.566 --> 49:42.966
<i>Had to find that out through the media.</i>

49:43.033 --> 49:48.166
<i>It's really concerning me that this woman</i>
<i>and her children cannot be located.</i>

49:48.233 --> 49:53.200
<i>It's... it's not okay! It scares me,</i>
<i>and I'm worried for all of them.</i>

49:55.866 --> 49:58.600
This is where the rubber
meets the road, Chris.

50:23.033 --> 50:24.700
We just can't figure out...

50:25.866 --> 50:27.366
why there's two Chrises.

50:27.433 --> 50:29.633
So we need to talk about that, okay?

50:29.733 --> 50:31.033
I cheated on her.

52:11.766 --> 52:13.300
Chicks are crazy.

52:13.366 --> 52:15.266
Can I talk to my dad or something?

52:15.333 --> 52:18.200
Absolutely. Do you want
to bring him in here?

52:18.266 --> 52:22.266
No, I just... can I talk to my dad?
Like, he flew across the country.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.233
Hey, Chris. How about this?

52:26.733 --> 52:30.366
If we brought your dad in here,
would you please tell him what happened?

52:33.500 --> 52:35.100
Can I just go talk to him out there?

52:35.166 --> 52:37.766
I've been in here for like,
five or six hours and I'm, like...

52:38.333 --> 52:41.200
Absolutely.
He deserves an answer.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.033
He's your best friend.

52:53.233 --> 52:56.366
Hey, Chris, we're gonna let you
have as much time you need, okay?

52:56.433 --> 52:58.100
Okay.
You're gonna leave us in here or no?

53:11.733 --> 53:13.933
You gonna tell me
what's going on or anything? Or...

53:15.400 --> 53:17.466
I messed up the polygraph.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.233
I failed it.

53:19.733 --> 53:21.533
-Failed it?
-Yeah, because there's--

53:21.966 --> 53:23.033
Too much emotions?

53:25.300 --> 53:26.433
So, I mean they're...

53:27.933 --> 53:29.566
not gonna let me go.

53:34.433 --> 53:36.300
Is there any reason why they shouldn't?

53:38.566 --> 53:40.000
They know I had an affair.

53:41.566 --> 53:43.100
They-- they-- they know.

53:44.266 --> 53:45.766
I came clean about that.

53:48.200 --> 53:51.833
Anything else you want to tell me?
What's going on or what happened,

53:51.900 --> 53:53.766
or anything you can think of?

53:54.400 --> 53:55.233
When...

53:56.033 --> 53:58.566
we had that conversation that morning,

54:01.133 --> 54:02.833
it was emotional, and...

54:03.766 --> 54:06.000
I told her about the separation
and everything like that.

54:12.366 --> 54:14.333
-I don't want to protect her.
-What?

54:14.400 --> 54:15.933
I don't want to protect her.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.633
You don't want to protect her?

54:19.600 --> 54:21.166
I don't know what else to say.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.100
-Did she hurt them?
-Yeah.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.000
And then I had to kill her.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.533
-I have to tell them I hurt her.
-You hurt her?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.033
So, she started hurting the kids?

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
Help me, Chris. What happened?

54:52.500 --> 54:53.433
She...

54:56.400 --> 54:57.633
-She...
-What?

54:57.733 --> 55:00.066
-She smothered them.
-She smothered them?

55:01.200 --> 55:02.400
Or choked them?

55:04.100 --> 55:05.200
Did she kill them?

55:07.633 --> 55:09.866
They were... they were blue.

55:10.833 --> 55:13.533
Both of them?
She choked both of them to death?

55:14.033 --> 55:16.333
I freaked out
and did the same thing to her.

55:18.066 --> 55:19.266
Oh my God.

55:22.366 --> 55:26.800
So, she killed both CeCe and Bella,
choked them to death?

55:32.466 --> 55:35.266
And you lost it
and then choked her, or...?

55:35.333 --> 55:37.433
Mm-hmm. I just... this was...

55:38.233 --> 55:40.033
rage. I mean, I hadn't...

55:44.233 --> 55:46.033
Good God almighty, son.

56:10.333 --> 56:12.400
Folks are here to pick up the dog.

56:12.666 --> 56:14.400
I'm just trying to catch it first.

56:57.133 --> 56:58.466
You did the hard part.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.400
All you have left
is to tell us where they're at.

57:02.566 --> 57:04.433
We can help you get them out of the cold.

57:05.933 --> 57:09.333
They're gone.
There's no bringing them back.

57:10.333 --> 57:11.700
Well, where are they?

57:19.500 --> 57:22.266
They're at the first location
I went to that day.

57:23.233 --> 57:26.666
Where did you put them out there?
Chris, that's really important.

57:27.433 --> 57:30.366
-I didn't know what else to do.
-I know, just tell me, where are the kids?

57:31.366 --> 57:34.566
I didn't know what else to do.
I was so scared.

57:36.633 --> 57:37.833
Will you show us?

57:38.300 --> 57:39.666
What's going to happen?

57:40.666 --> 57:42.300
We're gonna help them get out of there.

57:43.233 --> 57:45.500
Chris, I know they're gone,
but they're still your babies.

57:45.566 --> 57:47.666
-And you're still their dad.
-You don't want them out there.

57:47.733 --> 57:49.466
I don't want them out there.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.633
And you don't want someone else
to find them out there.

57:55.033 --> 57:56.600
You don't, I promise you.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.766
Can you give us a second, so we can
kind of get some things arranged?

58:04.833 --> 58:06.100
Can you do that?

58:06.933 --> 58:08.933
Ronnie, do you want
to stay in here with him?

58:22.566 --> 58:25.233
The problem is I don't even know
if they believe me or not.

58:27.666 --> 58:31.766
-Are they buried in something or...?
-Shanann is.

58:35.166 --> 58:36.566
What about the babies?

58:37.533 --> 58:41.066
That's what I'm worried about.
They're in a freaking oil tank.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.500
I didn't know what else to do.

58:50.033 --> 58:51.166
Please, God...

58:52.266 --> 58:53.333
forgive me.

59:00.800 --> 59:04.000
I think we have a picture of,
is it Cervi 319?

59:04.666 --> 59:07.066
Does that look familiar to you?
What is that?

59:07.366 --> 59:09.900
That's Cervi 319.

59:11.566 --> 59:12.633
Whereabouts...

59:13.666 --> 59:15.500
is Shanann and the girls?

59:18.366 --> 59:19.933
How old is this picture?

59:20.233 --> 59:21.933
-Today.
-Oh, it's today?

59:24.733 --> 59:25.900
Shanann right here.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.533
Is that "S" for Shanann, okay,
and where are the girls at?

59:35.433 --> 59:37.066
Are they in the tanks?

59:38.166 --> 59:41.033
They're like...
there's just a hatch on the top,

59:41.100 --> 59:43.300
and they're, like, 20 foot tanks.

59:45.366 --> 59:47.466
There was a sheet found down here.

59:48.533 --> 59:49.966
What is that from?

59:50.666 --> 59:52.800
That was what Shanann was wrapped in.

59:59.733 --> 1:00:02.766
So you're good with the public knowing
that Shanann killed her daughters?

1:00:02.833 --> 1:00:04.133
I did not hurt these girls.

1:00:04.233 --> 1:00:06.400
Are you okay with the public
knowing that Shanann--

1:00:06.466 --> 1:00:08.466
Yes, because I did not hurt these girls.

1:00:11.966 --> 1:00:13.733
What it looks like is that...

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:16.300
you found a new life...

1:00:16.966 --> 1:00:20.066
and the only way to get that new life
was to get rid of the old life.

1:00:21.300 --> 1:00:25.200
And I think that you killed these girls
before their mom came home

1:00:25.266 --> 1:00:27.466
-and then killed Shanann.
-No, no, no.

1:00:28.033 --> 1:00:31.466
It just doesn't make sense.
It just doesn't add up.

1:00:31.933 --> 1:00:35.100
So either you're this monster,

1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:38.200
"So, I just want
this young, hot girlfriend,

1:00:38.266 --> 1:00:41.866
so I'm gonna kill everyone
and hope it works out," or something.

1:00:43.433 --> 1:00:46.566
So, I think we're
very, very close to the truth,

1:00:46.633 --> 1:00:48.000
but not quite there yet.

1:00:52.433 --> 1:00:54.066
So if you're not that monster--

1:00:54.133 --> 1:00:55.566
I'm not a monster.

1:00:55.733 --> 1:00:56.600
I didn't...

1:00:57.700 --> 1:00:59.633
kill my babies.

1:01:10.866 --> 1:01:14.933
<i>On August 10th, Shanann flew out</i>
<i>to Arizona with Nickole.</i>

1:01:15.866 --> 1:01:19.233
<i>And I had the kids from Friday,</i>
<i>Saturday, and Sunday.</i>

1:01:22.433 --> 1:01:24.300
<i>Three or four years, I would say.</i>

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:28.866
<i>There was a training in Arizona</i>

1:01:28.966 --> 1:01:31.700
<i>that some of the top leaders</i>
<i>of the company were putting on.</i>

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:36.800
<i>She was actually waiting</i>
<i>on the front porch.</i>

1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.133
<i>Then we drove to the airport.</i>

1:01:41.066 --> 1:01:42.133
<i>It was around 4:30.</i>

1:05:21.966 --> 1:05:23.433
You talk about...

1:05:24.933 --> 1:05:29.166
children, and he's got his own kids,
and that makes you kind of uncomfortable

1:05:29.233 --> 1:05:31.833
because you'd like to have
your own family.

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.300
Put that in context for me.

1:05:34.366 --> 1:05:37.300
Is that-- is that a fair statement,
the way I'm saying it?

1:05:38.366 --> 1:05:41.633
I mean, I guess, but that was never
anything I, like, said to him, though.

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:45.566
Okay, that's what I wanted to know.
Did you ever say anything to him about...

1:05:45.633 --> 1:05:48.033
Never, never.

1:05:48.100 --> 1:05:50.633
-Anything about his kids being a problem?
-No.

1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:54.100
-Anything about his wife being a problem?
-Never, never.

1:05:54.566 --> 1:05:58.666
This shocked me just as much as
I think it shocked the rest of the world.

1:05:59.866 --> 1:06:00.700
All of it.

1:06:01.233 --> 1:06:02.633
Like, he lies so much.

1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:06.166
Now, I go back and think of all the shit,
and I'm like, "It's lies."

1:06:06.233 --> 1:06:09.266
I really thought she left. I was like...

1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:13.100
"Let her fucking go.
You know, she'll come back in a day."

1:06:13.166 --> 1:06:16.500
"She'll get right. Let her cool down.
She'll be here. It'll be okay."

1:06:16.566 --> 1:06:19.366
You know, like, had me convinced, like,

1:06:19.433 --> 1:06:22.166
"I think she's just upset."
And then-- and then...

1:10:14.066 --> 1:10:16.633
She called him that night
when we were at the airport.

1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:19.633
She's like, "Will you watch my stuff,
I'm gonna go talk to Chris real quick."

1:10:20.566 --> 1:10:22.733
She came back, and it couldn't
have been more than five minutes.

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.300
I was like, "Are you okay?"
She's like, "No."

1:10:24.366 --> 1:10:28.400
She's like, "I haven't talked to him
all day or hardly at all this weekend,

1:10:28.466 --> 1:10:30.033
and he wants to work out.

1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:32.666
He started working out
while he was on the phone with me.

1:10:32.766 --> 1:10:34.133
So I just let him go!"

1:13:21.233 --> 1:13:23.166
<i>She got home, like, at two o'clock.</i>

1:13:24.133 --> 1:13:26.033
<i>I just had a feeling that she knew, like,</i>

1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:27.900
<i>y'know, what I did.</i>

1:13:27.966 --> 1:13:29.566
<i>Saturday night was the last straw.</i>

1:13:31.433 --> 1:13:35.100
<i>Going out with somebody</i>
<i>and using our actual bank account card,</i>

1:13:35.166 --> 1:13:37.533
<i>and just, like,</i>
<i>not trying to hide it at all.</i>

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:42.266
<i>I felt her get into bed.</i>

1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:46.066
<i>She started rubbing her hand on me,</i>
<i>and we ended up having sex.</i>

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:49.666
<i>When I woke up later on in the morning,</i>

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:52.766
<i>I pretty much told her...</i>

1:13:53.333 --> 1:13:55.366
<i>I didn't think it was gonna work anymore.</i>

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:58.700
<i>And she was like, "What happened?</i>
<i>What was last night?" </i>

1:13:59.300 --> 1:14:03.433
<i>She was like, "I knew something,</i>
<i>I knew there was somebody else."</i>

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:06.000
<i>I couldn't just say,</i>
<i>"Yes, there is somebody else."</i>

1:14:06.066 --> 1:14:08.666
<i>Then she said, "You're never</i>
<i>going to see your kids again.</i>

1:14:08.733 --> 1:14:10.766
<i>You're never going to see</i>
<i>them again. Get off me."</i>

1:14:12.300 --> 1:14:16.600
<i>If I'd never met Nikki, would I ever</i>
<i>have thought our relationship was bad?</i>

1:14:16.666 --> 1:14:17.600
<i>Probably not.</i>

1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.333
<i>I told her I didn't love her anymore.</i>

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:23.500
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

1:14:26.233 --> 1:14:28.966
<i>She told me to get off of her,</i>
<i>and then I put my hands around her.</i>

1:14:33.466 --> 1:14:35.400
<i>I don't even want to say</i>
<i>I felt like I had to.</i>

1:14:35.466 --> 1:14:38.133
<i>I felt like there was already something</i>
<i>in my mind that was implanted</i>

1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:40.933
<i>that I was gonna do it, and I woke up</i>
<i>that morning, it was gonna happen,</i>

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.300
<i>and I had no control over it.</i>

1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:43.933
<i>Why couldn't I just let go?</i>

1:14:46.466 --> 1:14:47.666
<i>She wasn't fighting.</i>

1:14:51.466 --> 1:14:53.133
<i>Then Bella came in the room.</i>

1:14:55.933 --> 1:14:57.600
<i>"What's wrong with Mommy?"</i>

1:14:58.733 --> 1:15:01.166
<i>She had her little pink blanket with her.</i>

1:15:04.833 --> 1:15:07.500
<i>She was pretty much on the bed,</i>
<i>but she was face down.</i>

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:13.766
<i>I put Shanann in that sheet,</i>
<i>carried her downstairs.</i>

1:15:15.533 --> 1:15:16.800
I pulled my truck up.

1:15:22.833 --> 1:15:26.466
Sitting in the back in the,
like, in that bench seat.

1:15:28.766 --> 1:15:29.900
<i>On the floor.</i>

1:15:33.266 --> 1:15:35.000
<i>"Is Mommy okay?"</i>

1:15:37.333 --> 1:15:38.666
<i>"She'll be fine."</i>

1:15:41.333 --> 1:15:42.766
<i>When I was driving up there,</i>

1:15:42.833 --> 1:15:46.466
<i>they were just sitting there,</i>
<i>kind of asleep or kind of</i>

1:15:46.533 --> 1:15:48.900
<i>just holding onto each other,</i>
<i>laying in each other's laps.</i>

1:15:51.666 --> 1:15:53.933
<i>Honestly, like, I try to picture</i>
<i>that whole ride.</i>

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.700
<i>It's like 45 minutes</i>
<i>to an hour ride out there.</i>

1:15:56.766 --> 1:15:58.000
<i>And it's just like...</i>

1:15:58.666 --> 1:16:00.100
<i>couldn't I have, like...</i>

1:16:00.900 --> 1:16:02.200
<i>saved my girls' life?</i>

1:16:02.266 --> 1:16:05.133
<i>Couldn't I have done something?</i>
<i>Why did I do it? I don't know.</i>

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:07.133
<i>I wanted all my life was to be a dad,</i>

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:10.166
<i>just to have kids and they love me...</i>

1:16:10.233 --> 1:16:11.066
<i>all that.</i>

1:16:11.133 --> 1:16:13.233
<i>I just haven't... nothing made sense.</i>

1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:18.900
<i>CeCe was first.</i>

1:16:21.166 --> 1:16:22.666
<i>I put the blanket over her head.</i>

1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:27.700
<i>I don't think so...</i>

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.533
<i>She said, "What happened to CeCe?"</i>

1:16:34.766 --> 1:16:36.333
<i>Every time I close my eyes,</i>

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.233
<i>I start to see her say, "Daddy, no,"</i>
<i>and that was it.</i>

1:16:40.066 --> 1:16:41.500
<i>I hear that every day.</i>

1:17:28.133 --> 1:17:30.666
Your Honor, Sandi Rzucek
would like to address the court.

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.266
I wanted to say thank you for this moment.

1:20:20.033 --> 1:20:21.733
All the girls' blankies are gone.

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:23.966
-Her phone's here.
-This is her lifeline.

1:20:32.166 --> 1:20:33.700
Her wedding ring's here?

1:20:33.766 --> 1:20:35.533
He's not acting right at all.

1:20:37.733 --> 1:20:39.366
She's pregnant as well.

1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:12.700
I love school.
