[gentle music]

01:36.487 --> 01:39.055
[door squeaks]

01:48.847 --> 01:50.806
- Hurry up, Auggie, ugh.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.987
Auggie, hurry it up,
time is short!

01:59.162 --> 02:01.469
- [August] Yeah, I'm coming.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.646
[August groans]

02:04.689 --> 02:05.516
- August.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.735
- This is just great.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.736
- Stop playing games!

02:07.779 --> 02:10.347
We've got work to do, come on!

02:10.391 --> 02:12.044
- I hate this place!

02:18.138 --> 02:18.964
Dad?

02:19.922 --> 02:20.879
Keeper.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.794
- There, what is it, Auggie?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.274
- What are we doing here?

02:24.318 --> 02:25.971
A man could get killed
in this storm.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.103
- Yes, he could.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.844
That's exactly why we're here.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.802
Now, come on, get inside.

02:30.846 --> 02:34.154
[light switch clicking]

02:36.068 --> 02:36.982
No power.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.768
- Of course, there's no power.

02:39.811 --> 02:40.812
- Oh, just a loose bulb.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.771
- Let's get outta here.

02:42.814 --> 02:46.818
- Auggie, do I need to
remind you that our family

02:46.862 --> 02:49.865
have been the harbor masters
and the lighthouse keepers

02:49.908 --> 02:50.996
in Owl's Point for--

02:51.040 --> 02:53.825
- Five generations, I know.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.915
- And you, you Auggie,
are the sixth.

02:58.569 --> 03:02.921
- I got a sixth sense
that aint gonna happen.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.967
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.403
- We're here for the tourists,

03:06.447 --> 03:08.666
to show them what
life used to be.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.190
Dad, we're actors.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.456
Dad, let me help.
- I'll get the light.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.283
- [August] But--

03:16.326 --> 03:18.459
- [Keeper] Just stay here.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.290
[tense ambient music]

03:23.333 --> 03:26.206
[thunder rumbling]

03:30.775 --> 03:32.429
- I've got your
ticket out of here.

03:32.473 --> 03:36.128
I said, I got your
ticket out of here.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.740
Chicago to L.A., nonstop.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.481
- Rhonda, hi.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.178
- Is something wrong, August?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.832
- No, I was just
thinking about--

03:43.875 --> 03:46.748
- Thinking of a way to thank
me for being the only manager

03:46.791 --> 03:49.272
that could get you out of
the national tour of the show

03:49.316 --> 03:51.405
that you made a Broadway hit
to get you to L.A. in time

03:51.448 --> 03:53.015
to star in the movie
based on the show

03:53.058 --> 03:54.277
that you made a Broadway hit.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.713
[August chuckles]

03:55.757 --> 03:57.628
- Rhonda, you read my mind.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.021
- There's no need to thank me.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.283
It's my pleasure.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.807
Besides, the 30%
interest I own in you

04:02.851 --> 04:05.288
is all the thanks I need.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.551
You leave for L.A. tonight.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.032
- Tonight?

04:10.075 --> 04:10.859
Why tonight?

04:10.902 --> 04:12.382
- Why not tonight?

04:12.426 --> 04:15.124
- Rhonda, you know how
I feel about flying.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.344
- Did I mention your
ticket is First Class?

04:17.387 --> 04:19.259
- I just wanted one last night

04:19.302 --> 04:21.696
to celebrate with the cast.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.264
Give me one good reason why
we need to leave tonight.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.570
- I'll give you three
good reasons.

04:26.614 --> 04:30.052
The Terry Parsons Show booked
you for tomorrow afternoon.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.098
You're the featured guest
on Spotlight Tonight

04:33.142 --> 04:36.406
tomorrow night, and
you're scheduled for lunch

04:36.450 --> 04:38.713
with Gerald Winfrow.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.367
- Who?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.630
- The writer of the movie.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.935
- Writer?

04:43.979 --> 04:46.416
I've been doing this role
for seven years.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.897
I can do the part in my sleep.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.901
The fact is, I probably have.

04:52.944 --> 04:56.165
- Exactly why we need to
get out of here.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.645
We need to change.

04:57.688 --> 05:01.736
No more dirty, old,
disgusting, run-down theaters.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.044
Hollywood, August.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.482
Sunshine, swimming pools.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.440
- Movie stars.
- Movie stars.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.225
- [Rhonda] And here
comes the next big thing.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.575
August Starr--

05:14.618 --> 05:15.576
[loud knocking]

05:15.619 --> 05:18.274
- Curtain in 10 minutes, August.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.797
Oh, hello, Rhonda.

05:20.711 --> 05:21.538
- Terry.

05:22.757 --> 05:23.975
- Thanks, Tony.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.239
Who died?

05:27.283 --> 05:28.937
- You did, kind of.

05:28.980 --> 05:32.244
The cast and the crew,
they wanted to...

05:36.031 --> 05:39.730
- "To August Star, the
brightest star of them all.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.385
"See you on the red carpet."

05:42.429 --> 05:43.734
- How witty.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.433
- Thank everybody for me.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.651
- We love you, man.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.740
- It's been great run.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.568
- We loathe you, ma'am.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.918
- Good riddance, Timmy.

05:53.962 --> 05:54.789
- Tony.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.182
- Hm?

05:58.923 --> 06:00.185
- Oh, hey, huh?

06:03.406 --> 06:04.886
- What's this for?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.236
- Sign the wall.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.248
- Hey, Timmy, move
out of the way.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.118
- No.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.081
Always reach for the stars.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.867
I'll catch you on stage.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.134
[gentle music]

06:47.407 --> 06:49.539
- Maybe I should
finish the tour.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.673
- Maybe you should leave
decisions like that to me.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.239
- Really, Rhonda?

06:54.283 --> 06:56.328
When is your contract up?

06:58.156 --> 07:00.811
[door slamming]

07:06.208 --> 07:07.035
- Ah!

07:08.558 --> 07:10.604
- Excuse me!
- Oh.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.909
- [Rhonda] August, we
need to talk.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.128
- Not now, Rhonda.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.435
I have a show to do, remember,
acting?

07:15.478 --> 07:16.958
It's what got us here in
the first place.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.829
- August.
- Later, Rhonda.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.832
[people chattering]

07:23.617 --> 07:25.096
- [Rhonda] August?

07:27.272 --> 07:28.535
August?

07:28.578 --> 07:29.797
- August!
- Hey!

07:30.798 --> 07:33.496
[tone ringing]

07:33.540 --> 07:35.846
- August, what's going on?

07:35.890 --> 07:36.673
- I'm fine.

07:36.717 --> 07:37.935
I'm just tired.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.896
You told me I had a month
before the movie started.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.288
- You do.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.725
- I was planning some time off.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.987
- You're kidding, right?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.162
Do you know how hard it
was to book you

07:47.205 --> 07:48.772
on the Parsons Show?

07:48.816 --> 07:51.253
You're not exactly a
household name, not yet.

07:51.296 --> 07:54.604
- Great, then let's
wait until I am.

07:54.648 --> 07:55.605
- Hey, but it's not gonna happen

07:55.649 --> 07:58.173
unless you do the Parsons Show.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.610
August, hey!

08:00.654 --> 08:02.133
- Rhonda!
- August!

08:04.919 --> 08:06.877
- [Rhonda] August!

08:06.921 --> 08:07.748
August!

08:07.791 --> 08:09.314
- [August] Sh!

08:09.358 --> 08:10.359
- Okay, hey, hey!

08:11.752 --> 08:14.798
You know I only have your
best interests at heart.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.758
Okay, fine, and my 30%.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.587
- Rhonda, I
appreciate everything.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.024
Really, I do.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.068
You work hard.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.376
Thank you, but I work hard, too.

08:27.419 --> 08:28.638
I need some time.

08:29.770 --> 08:33.991
["Once Upon A Dream"
instrumental]

08:35.689 --> 08:36.603
Hey.

08:36.646 --> 08:37.778
- Hey Auggie, ready for sound?

08:37.821 --> 08:38.866
- Yep, ready for sound.
- All right.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.258
- [Tech] Let's get
this thing done.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.346
- I appreciate all the
flowers you guys sent me.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.000
That was really nice.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.045
- All right.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.962
- Testing, one, two, three.

08:48.005 --> 08:48.832
- All right, you're good.

08:48.876 --> 08:49.659
- Thanks, Bobby.

08:49.703 --> 08:50.486
- You bet.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.313
- Time off, sure.

08:51.356 --> 08:52.140
No problem.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.010
[Bobby scoffs]

08:53.054 --> 08:54.142
- Yeah right.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.753
- August, you're right.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.233
It's been a long run.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.364
You need to rest.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.757
- I do!

09:00.801 --> 09:03.238
- My first job will be
to schedule you a nice,

09:03.281 --> 09:04.761
longer vacation.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.023
- Really?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.896
- At least a weekend, a
long weekend.

09:08.939 --> 09:09.723
- [August] Rhonda!

09:09.766 --> 09:12.160
- But first, there's this.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.465
- What is this?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.076
- Your scheduled
appearances for the next--

09:15.119 --> 09:15.903
- Two weeks?

09:15.946 --> 09:16.425
- Sh!

09:17.687 --> 09:19.210
- [August] I didn't agree
to any of this.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.429
- Yes, we did.

09:28.089 --> 09:31.048
Remember, what's hot
today can just as easily

09:31.092 --> 09:33.311
become what's not tomorrow.

09:34.661 --> 09:38.099
I'm here to make sure that
doesn't happen.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.015
- If you change your mind,
let me know.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.016
My number's on the bottom.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.409
- [Bobby] Yeah, I will Tony.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.323
- [Woman] One minute August.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.455
- Thanks Kim.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.286
What's that about?

09:51.329 --> 09:52.200
- My cousin.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.942
He moves specialty cars.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.596
I was gonna take next week off

09:56.639 --> 09:58.685
and drive that down to
Vegas to a client of his,

09:58.728 --> 10:00.774
but someone who shall
remain nameless

10:00.817 --> 10:02.297
decided to quit the show.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.038
So I requested to stay here

10:04.081 --> 10:05.692
and help the new guy for
the first week.

10:05.735 --> 10:06.518
- Sorry.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.911
Sweet ride though.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.304
- It is.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.698
And my cousin isn't one
for taking no.

10:11.741 --> 10:12.960
Hey!

10:13.003 --> 10:15.049
Hey kid, you old enough
to go to Vegas?

10:15.092 --> 10:17.312
Forget that, you old
enough to drive?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.443
- 20 seconds.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.061
- Tony!

10:27.104 --> 10:27.888
- Cue in five!

10:27.931 --> 10:28.976
- Okay, okay!

10:32.022 --> 10:32.806
- [Kim] And this.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.983

12:05.028 --> 12:06.421
- Nice car!

12:06.464 --> 12:08.249
- Yeah, thanks.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.816
Hey, do me a favor.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.210
Keep an eye on it for
a few minutes.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.951
- Yeah, sure, thanks!

12:23.220 --> 12:25.745
[door ringing]

12:32.490 --> 12:33.361
- Waitress.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.841
- Waitress?

12:34.884 --> 12:37.017
It's worse than that, I
own the place.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.192
- Sorry.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.063
- Can I help you?

12:40.107 --> 12:41.848
- Kate is it?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.153
- Great deduction.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.286
- Kate, I'll have a
skinny caramel latte

12:45.329 --> 12:46.809
with two shots of espresso.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.638
- [Kate] Decaf or regular?

12:49.681 --> 12:50.508
- Regular.

13:00.649 --> 13:04.479
Thank you.
[phone ringing]

13:04.522 --> 13:05.262
Yeah.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.263
- Where are you?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.091
- Good morning to you too boss.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.006
- The limo service that
was sent to pick you up

13:10.050 --> 13:12.008
at LAX says you weren't
on the plane.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.183
- Yeah, that's correct.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.619
Well, didn't I tell you?

13:14.663 --> 13:15.795
- Tell me what?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.100
- I'm driving to Vegas.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.449
- Vegas?

13:18.493 --> 13:19.973
- Mm-hm.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.235
Yeah, I'm in...

13:22.279 --> 13:23.106
[hand tapping]

13:23.150 --> 13:25.195
Excuse me, where am I?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.849
- Cedar Creek, Iowa.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.504
- Iowa.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.854
- I-O what?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.726
- Listen, as soon as I make
the delivery for Tony--

13:34.770 --> 13:36.076
- Tony.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.382
Okay, I knew he would
be messed up in this.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.688
What about the Parsons show?

13:39.731 --> 13:41.603
- You'll figure something out.

13:41.646 --> 13:44.736
I'll be in Vegas in two days,
three maybe.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.087
After I make the drop,
I'll head to L.A., promise.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.349
- Look, you listen to me,

13:48.392 --> 13:49.872
you get yourself--

13:49.916 --> 13:50.830
- Rhonda, you're cutting out.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.743
I think it's a bad connection.

13:51.787 --> 13:52.962
- Don't give me that.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.442
I know you can hear me
perfectly well.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.573
- Rhonda [imitates static]

13:55.617 --> 13:56.879
I'll call ya
[imitates static] back

13:56.923 --> 13:58.359
when better [imitates
static] signal--

13:58.402 --> 13:59.534
- August!

13:59.577 --> 14:02.406
[August laughing]

14:05.496 --> 14:07.672
[phone ringing]

14:09.239 --> 14:11.763
- Look, I just told you, two
to three days at the most!

14:11.807 --> 14:13.896
Just leave me alone!

14:13.940 --> 14:16.029
- Am I speaking to August Star?

14:16.072 --> 14:16.986
- Who's asking?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.466
- This is Amanda Benson.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.511
The administrator at the
Owl's Nest Nursing Home.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.252
- What did he do now?

14:22.296 --> 14:23.079
- Excuse me?

14:23.123 --> 14:24.689
- Did he escape again?

14:24.733 --> 14:25.952
- As a matter of fact, yes.

14:25.995 --> 14:26.778
- How far did he get this time?

14:26.822 --> 14:28.215
- To the harbor.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.173
- You guys really need a
better security system.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.262
- Mr. Star, I'm sorry
to inform you

14:32.306 --> 14:34.221
that there has been a
significant deterioration

14:34.264 --> 14:35.700
in your father's condition.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.398
- Oh.
[slow gentle music]

14:37.441 --> 14:39.052
What do you mean?

14:39.095 --> 14:42.577
- It's safe to say that tomorrow
won't be as good as today.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.795
He keeps asking for you.

14:43.839 --> 14:44.884
- For me?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.842
- I'm assuming you're Auggie?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.017
- Used to be.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.366
- If there is any way
you could find

14:49.410 --> 14:51.803
the time to come
visit your father,

14:51.847 --> 14:54.458
I would recommend you do it now.

14:56.765 --> 14:57.592
Mr. Star?

14:58.723 --> 14:59.550
- Yeah.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.335
I'm...

15:04.555 --> 15:06.775
Looks, thanks for the call.

15:08.211 --> 15:08.951
- Hello?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.171
Hello?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.828
- [Kate] Would you
like a warm-up?

15:16.872 --> 15:17.699
- No.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.701
No thank you.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.273
Keep the change.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.753
- Come back again real soon.

15:28.797 --> 15:31.452
[door ringing]

15:31.495 --> 15:34.368
[phone ringing]

15:34.411 --> 15:35.630
- Later Rhonda.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.032
Hey!

15:47.729 --> 15:52.125
Hey, do you know how to get
to Owl's Point Wisconsin?

15:52.168 --> 15:53.213
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

15:53.256 --> 15:54.605
So what you're gonna
do is you're

15:54.649 --> 15:57.304
gonna take this road down
to Highway 151 North,

15:57.347 --> 16:00.350
and then get onto I-43
North and just keep going.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.222
If you hit water,
you've gone too far.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.310
- All right, thanks bud.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.920
- Yeah, no problem.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.864
- [August] Yeah, this is
August, please leave a message.

16:35.907 --> 16:39.259
- Oh, I'll leave a
message all right.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
[phone ringing]

16:42.914 --> 16:45.787
- [Woman] 911, please state
the nature of your emergency.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.443
- Yes, I would like to
report a missing actor.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.967
[light music]

17:09.550 --> 17:10.377
- Stop!

17:11.552 --> 17:14.294
[car screeching]

17:16.209 --> 17:17.036
- Is everything all right?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.081
- Not exactly!

17:19.125 --> 17:21.736
- Good, none of it
spilled on the car.

17:21.779 --> 17:22.998
- What!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.347
Thanks for your concern!

17:24.391 --> 17:26.654
- Sorry, it's not mine.

17:26.697 --> 17:27.524
- I see.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.701
- Oh, are you all right?

17:32.268 --> 17:33.095
- I'm fine.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.359
- Let me buy you some
replacement coffees.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.361
It's the least I can do.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.235
- You're August Star.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.323
- Yeah, I am.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.761
- I thought you looked familiar.

17:46.804 --> 17:50.156
- I'd like to keep it
quiet that I'm here.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.809
- Maybe I should have got hit.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.029
"Celebrity takes out
local resident."

17:54.073 --> 17:55.900
What a headline.

17:55.944 --> 17:59.382
- Look, let's pretend this
never happened.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.820
- I see.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.692
Money solves all ones problems.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.215
- It doesn't hurt.

18:07.738 --> 18:11.351
- [Amanda] It's nice to
see you again, Auggie.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.917
- Do I know you?

18:12.961 --> 18:15.703
- [Amanda] Probably not,
but I know you.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.921
- Wait!

18:16.965 --> 18:18.097
Who are you?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.968
- I'm Mandy, Kirkwood.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.015
Roger's little sister.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.452
- Oh!

18:25.495 --> 18:26.801
Mandy!

18:26.844 --> 18:28.411
How are you?

18:28.455 --> 18:32.241
- Well, for nearly being
run over by a car, not bad.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.460
- You were what?

18:33.503 --> 18:35.984
In seventh grade when
we were seniors?

18:36.027 --> 18:37.942
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.075
- What's Roger up to these days?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.382
- He owns a marine dealership
down on Sturgeon Bay.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.470
- That figures.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.125
- Well, he always
liked the water.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.778
Not like some people we know.

18:47.822 --> 18:48.518
- Who?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.085
Me?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.956
- Roger said you couldn't
wait to get off Owl's Point.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.567
- Can you blame me?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.090
Other than some summer
stock theater

18:55.134 --> 18:57.353
and the state park,
there isn't much

18:57.397 --> 19:00.269
opportunity for an
actor around here.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.184
- I heard you're making the
jump from stage to screen,

19:02.228 --> 19:03.446
congratulations.

19:03.490 --> 19:04.795
- Thanks.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.797
I'm on my way to L.A. now.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.886
- Owl's Point is sort
of a round about

19:08.930 --> 19:11.802
way to Hollywood,
wouldn't you say?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.155
It's nice to see you again.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.025
- Wait.

19:17.895 --> 19:19.636
Let my buy you lunch.

19:20.985 --> 19:21.943
- I just ate.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.640
- Okay, coffee than.

19:24.815 --> 19:25.642
I owe you.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.691
- Thanks, but I'm already late

19:30.734 --> 19:32.562
and you are procrastinating.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.130
Auggie, go see your Dad.
[horn honking]

19:35.174 --> 19:37.437
- How do you know I'm
here to see my Dad?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.265
- I work at the Owl's
Nest Nursing Home.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.831
- Really?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.920
Let me give you a ride.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.400
- The Nest is right
down the street.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.229
- Well then, let me
walk with you.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.102
- It's a free sidewalk.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.673
[horn honking]

20:02.288 --> 20:04.115
- Same old Owl's Point.

20:04.159 --> 20:04.986
- Yup.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.118
They're gonna change
the lighthouse

20:07.162 --> 20:09.164
into an observation tower.

20:09.208 --> 20:09.773
- Really?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.210
- Yup.

20:11.253 --> 20:11.819
Gonna replace the light
with the tower viewer.

20:11.862 --> 20:12.907
- A what?

20:12.950 --> 20:13.995
- You know one of
those things you

20:14.038 --> 20:15.518
put money into to
look through to--

20:15.562 --> 20:16.432
- Oh, yeah!

20:17.912 --> 20:19.000
Wow.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.697
- Keeper isn't happy about it.

20:20.741 --> 20:22.351
- I bet not.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.745
- So how long has it been
since you've been back?

20:24.788 --> 20:25.615
- A few years.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.182
Maybe six or seven.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.837
After the show closed
on Broadway,

20:29.880 --> 20:31.447
we took it on tour.

20:32.753 --> 20:33.797
I haven't had much time off.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.016
- I see.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.931
- Besides, there
hasn't been a whole

20:36.974 --> 20:38.672
lot of reason to come back.

20:38.715 --> 20:39.629
- What about Keeper?

20:39.673 --> 20:40.239
- Keeper?

20:41.501 --> 20:43.851
My Dad and I don't exactly
see eye to eye.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.374
- Well how do you know
when you haven't been here

20:45.418 --> 20:47.376
to look him in the eye?

20:47.420 --> 20:50.379
- Let's just say that my
departure from Owl's Point

20:50.423 --> 20:52.686
did not meet with his approval.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.862
After all, who'd wanna
give up all this

20:54.905 --> 20:56.646
for life as an actor?

20:57.821 --> 21:00.171
- Is that a rhetorical question?

21:00.215 --> 21:01.347
- Don't get me wrong,

21:01.390 --> 21:04.480
Owl's Point is great
for some people.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.352
- For uninspired people like me.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.571
- Didn't you ever wanna
see what's out there?

21:08.615 --> 21:12.053
What's out beyond
that lighthouse?

21:12.096 --> 21:14.316
- Tell me, August the Star,

21:15.361 --> 21:16.362
what's out there?

21:17.798 --> 21:21.018
What's out there that
can't be found right here?

21:21.062 --> 21:23.412
- [August] To each their own.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.074
- And who are your own?

21:33.117 --> 21:34.380
The paparazzi?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.904
Fanatic fans, the
suffocating crowds?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.514
- Don't knock it til you try it.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.995
- What about the people
who really love you?

21:41.038 --> 21:42.431
- Really love me?

21:43.432 --> 21:45.042
What's, what's real?

21:46.217 --> 21:49.873
Real is what you
pretend real to be.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.266
I'm an actor remember?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.572
- What about Keeper?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.225
He is real.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.488
- I pay for his care.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.057
- That's right, money
solves all ones problems.

22:00.101 --> 22:03.322
- It's a lot more than
some people do.

22:03.365 --> 22:07.151
Look, my Dad's nickname
is more than accurate.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.678
Especially when it comes to me.

22:11.721 --> 22:14.637
He saw his duty was not only
keeping that lighthouse,

22:14.681 --> 22:17.423
but keeping me locked in
it at all costs.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.904
Even at the cost of
my happiness.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.036
Is that love?

22:24.473 --> 22:26.214
- So you were abused?

22:28.608 --> 22:30.218
- Just detained.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.873
- Maybe Keeper thought he
knew what was best for you.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.397
We all make mistakes.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.312
- And some of us are able to

22:37.356 --> 22:39.445
admit to those mistakes.

22:39.488 --> 22:43.362
- Maybe the apple didn't
fall far from the lighthouse.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.320
- Maybe this walk wasn't
such a good idea.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.277
- Then maybe it's a
good thing we have

22:46.321 --> 22:48.845
arrived at the end of the line.

23:04.731 --> 23:05.688
Hi Carol.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.038
- [Carol] Hello, how are you?

23:10.737 --> 23:12.478
- It's nice to see you
again August.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.175
- Nice to see you Mandy.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.350
- You'll find Keeper's
room down the hall

23:15.394 --> 23:16.786
and to the right.

23:16.830 --> 23:17.787
Don't forget to sign in

23:17.831 --> 23:20.573
and sanitize your hands.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.096
- So, what are you?

23:22.139 --> 23:23.880
A secretary or something?

23:23.924 --> 23:25.316
- Something like that.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.579
Goodbye Auggie.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.015
Afternoon ladies.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.321
- Amanda.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.369
Mandy, of course
she'd be the boss.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.202
- Sorry, excuse me.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.029
- Hey Dan.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.900
- [Dan] Oh, hi ladies.

23:52.953 --> 23:55.564
[door knocking]

23:58.741 --> 23:59.525
- Dad?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.446
Dad?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.143
- Oh, he's sleeping.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.450
- Oh, I'm sorry.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.060
I thought he was alone.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.931
- I'm Mike, our caregiver.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.542
Keeper's one of my regulars.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.674
You must be August.

24:18.718 --> 24:19.762
- How did you know?

24:19.806 --> 24:21.634
- You just called him Dad.

24:21.677 --> 24:22.635
[August chuckling]

24:22.678 --> 24:23.853
- [August] Right.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.072
- It's nice to meet you.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.377
I've heard a lot about you.

24:26.421 --> 24:27.291
- Really?

24:27.335 --> 24:28.467
Anything you can repeat?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.642
[Mike laughing]

24:29.685 --> 24:31.165
- Well, actually all of it.

24:31.208 --> 24:34.298
I heard about your many
fishing excursions for bass.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.693
Right, your sailing
adventures to Willow Island,

24:37.737 --> 24:39.652
and oh, your hunts buried
pirate treasure

24:39.695 --> 24:41.001
along the shore.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.438
And how you and Keeper
worked together

24:43.482 --> 24:44.918
protecting the coast
by making sure

24:44.961 --> 24:47.007
the light never went out.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.842
- That was a long time ago.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.887
- Not to Keeper.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.411
To him, it happened yesterday.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.155
What is it?

25:05.199 --> 25:06.940
- Do we know each other?

25:06.983 --> 25:08.332
You look familiar.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.638
- Well, maybe for the
fact that I was witness

25:09.682 --> 25:10.770
to you nearly turning
the center's

25:10.813 --> 25:12.946
Administrator into a speed bump.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.469
- That's it!

25:14.513 --> 25:16.863
You were the guy that ran
in the middle of the road.

25:16.906 --> 25:17.820
- You seemed distracted.

25:17.864 --> 25:20.562
- Yeah, well, I thought I...

25:20.606 --> 25:22.738
You didn't see a man
and a boy in raincoats

25:22.782 --> 25:24.740
sitting outside the ice
cream parlor did you?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.394
- Well, I can't say I did.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.961
Why?

25:28.004 --> 25:29.049
- Nevermind.

25:29.092 --> 25:32.008
[slow paced music]

25:37.448 --> 25:38.798
I'll come back later.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.495
- Why later?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.453
- When he's awake.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.543
- What you see is what you get.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.805
- Really?

25:45.848 --> 25:47.328
- Pretty much.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.112
When you sleep 20 hours a day,

25:49.156 --> 25:51.506
losing 15 minutes is not
gonna make a big difference.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.420
Keeper.
[Keeper groans]

25:52.463 --> 25:53.464
- Keeper!
[Keeper groans]

25:53.508 --> 25:54.770
- Keeper wake up.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.555
I have a surprise for you.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.599
- [Keeper] What is it?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
- Look who's here.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.168
- It's about time.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.517
What took him so long?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.737
- Well better late than
never, right Keeper?

26:04.780 --> 26:06.434
- What's for dinner?

26:09.785 --> 26:12.048
- Lasagna, your favorite.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.746
Maybe August can join you.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.269
- Auggie!

26:15.312 --> 26:16.270
Where is he?

26:16.313 --> 26:17.706
- I'm right here.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.536
It's good to see you again Dad.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.537
- What's going on here?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.713
- It's me, August, Auggie.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.021
- I don't know you.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.023
- Keeper, it's your son.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.721
- That's not my son.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.029
Auggie's at school.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.422
- Keeper, August drove
all this way--

26:38.466 --> 26:41.251
- I told you, that
is not Auggie!

26:41.295 --> 26:42.383
- It's okay Mike.

26:42.426 --> 26:43.079
- Get him out of here!

26:43.123 --> 26:44.472
- But Keeper--

26:44.515 --> 26:45.821
- [Keeper] Look at him
what's wrong with you!

26:45.865 --> 26:47.388
- [August] I better leave.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.433
- Good, get out!

26:49.477 --> 26:50.304
Out!

26:52.175 --> 26:53.394
- Come back later,

26:53.437 --> 26:55.788
August, these things take time.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.050
He'll be fine when
he calms down.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.617
- Sure.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.618
See ya Mike.

27:00.923 --> 27:02.359
- Why did you let him in here?

27:02.403 --> 27:04.448
- [Mike] I'm sorry Keeper.

27:04.492 --> 27:05.928
- [Keeper] That's not Auggie.

27:05.972 --> 27:06.799
Auggie's at school!

27:06.842 --> 27:08.148
- [Mike] I know.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.890
- [Keeper] What's for dinner?

27:10.933 --> 27:11.804
- [Mike] Lasagna.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.067
- [Keeper] Oh, my favorite.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.766
[slow paced music]

27:17.810 --> 27:20.464
- Sir, don't forget to sign out.

27:26.209 --> 27:29.038
[rustling waters]

28:12.212 --> 28:15.128
[thunder rumbling]

28:17.870 --> 28:19.828
- August, stop playing games!

28:19.872 --> 28:22.091
We got work to do, come on!

28:22.135 --> 28:24.920
- [August] I hate this place.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.530
- [Little Girl] Excuse me.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.662
Excuse me.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.924
- Oh, hi.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.273
Can I help you?

28:30.317 --> 28:31.927
- May I have your autograph?

28:31.971 --> 28:33.146
- My autograph?

28:33.189 --> 28:34.538
- Yes please.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.932
- Sure, I'd be happy to sign.

28:36.976 --> 28:37.977
What's your name?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.239
- Olivia.

28:39.282 --> 28:40.109
- Olivia.

28:41.154 --> 28:41.981
To Olivia,

28:45.201 --> 28:46.202
always reach

28:47.856 --> 28:48.988
for the stars.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.864
There ya go.

28:55.908 --> 28:57.387
- August Star, oh.

28:58.432 --> 28:59.346
- What is it?

28:59.389 --> 29:01.000
- I thought you were famous.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.305
- Famous huh?

29:02.349 --> 29:03.306
Who told you that?

29:03.350 --> 29:04.743
- My Mom.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.484
- [August] Where is she?

29:07.528 --> 29:08.964
That's your Mom?

29:09.008 --> 29:10.661
- Yeah.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.533
Can I go play with my
friends now?

29:12.576 --> 29:13.403
- Sure.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.404
Stay away from the water.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.710
- [Olivia] Okay!

29:15.754 --> 29:17.973
- Here, let me take your
pen and notebook.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.192
- Thanks.

29:19.235 --> 29:22.586
You're a pretty good guy,
for a nobody.

29:22.630 --> 29:23.936
[kids screaming]

29:23.979 --> 29:24.763
- Thanks.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.462
Yup, definitely related.

29:28.505 --> 29:29.985
No doubt about it.

29:32.335 --> 29:33.815
An autograph?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.251
- Oh, I didn't want
you to feel like

29:35.295 --> 29:38.951
a fish out of water here
in little old Owl's Point.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.779
I know how much you show
people you crave attention.

29:40.822 --> 29:41.649
- We do?

29:43.085 --> 29:44.304
- Yeah, you do.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.307
- That was my manager's doing.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.830
- Oh.

29:48.874 --> 29:49.700
Of course.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.008
How was your visit with Keeper?

29:53.052 --> 29:54.096
- Good.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.358
- Really?

29:55.402 --> 29:55.794
- Yeah.

29:57.404 --> 30:01.974
- You're not gonna win any
awards with that performance.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.932
- All right, it could
have gone better.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.020
- For who, you or Keeper?

30:05.064 --> 30:06.152
- Excuse me?

30:06.195 --> 30:07.936
- You haven't been
here in how long?

30:07.980 --> 30:09.503
- So my leaving caused this?

30:09.546 --> 30:10.417
- No, this would've
happened to Keeper

30:10.460 --> 30:12.071
if you were here or not.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.550
But Auggie, you haven't been in

30:13.594 --> 30:16.597
his life in a long time,
have you?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.034
- I suppose not much.

30:19.078 --> 30:22.168
- Listen, this isn't a
scientific explanation,

30:22.211 --> 30:23.517
but it may help you understand

30:23.560 --> 30:25.519
what your Dad is going through.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.043
Picture the brain as a
head of lettuce.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.959
Memories from the past are
in the center of the head,

30:31.003 --> 30:34.267
and the more recent memories
are the leaves on the outside.

30:34.310 --> 30:37.226
And as you peel those
leaves away,

30:37.270 --> 30:39.620
those memories just--

30:39.663 --> 30:41.100
- Disappear.

30:41.143 --> 30:41.927
- Yeah.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.540
Keeper does remember you Auggie,

30:46.583 --> 30:48.934
but to him you're a teenager.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.893
- [August] And your daughter?

30:51.937 --> 30:52.894
- [Amanda] What about her?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.853
- Olivia's Dad.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.246
Mr. Benson I presume?

30:57.290 --> 30:59.509
- You presume correctly.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.207
- How long have you
been married?

31:01.250 --> 31:05.211
- Next month, it would
have been 11 years.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.603
- So he left you?

31:06.647 --> 31:07.474
- He

31:08.997 --> 31:09.824
left me

31:10.956 --> 31:12.174
when his Humvee ran over

31:12.218 --> 31:14.960
an IED on a desert road
in Afghanistan.

31:16.483 --> 31:21.575
Rob was deployed five months
before Olivia was born.

31:21.618 --> 31:24.273
They never got a chance
to meet each other.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.013
Listen,

31:26.406 --> 31:28.712
I knew what I was doing
when I married the Army,

31:28.756 --> 31:31.759
and I would do it
all over again.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.240
Besides, Rob and
Olivia aren't the

31:34.283 --> 31:36.633
parent and child we need
to talk about right now.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.808
- Let's not go there.

31:37.852 --> 31:40.159
- Listen, I have an idea.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.465
- Hm, what kind of an idea?

31:42.509 --> 31:44.293
- A good one.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.642
At least

31:45.686 --> 31:49.255
I think it could possibly
be a good one.

31:49.298 --> 31:50.604
Maybe.

31:50.647 --> 31:52.214
- That's reassuring.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.041
- Just listen.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.521
- [August] I'm listening.

31:54.564 --> 31:56.349
- Miracles do happen.

31:56.392 --> 31:57.219
- Nice.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.179
- Just promise me that
you will drive

32:00.222 --> 32:02.659
that fancy car of yours
over to the Owl's Nest

32:02.703 --> 32:04.574
and nine a.m. tomorrow.

32:04.618 --> 32:05.401
- But I'm--

32:05.445 --> 32:06.228
- Promise?

32:09.014 --> 32:11.451
- All right, I promise.

32:11.494 --> 32:12.843
- Great.

32:12.887 --> 32:14.715
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.678
August, where are you staying?

32:23.028 --> 32:27.293
- Frankly, I haven't
thought that far ahead.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.903
- Here, take these.

32:31.906 --> 32:35.518
- You're okay with me
staying at your place?

32:37.564 --> 32:41.263
- Those are Keeper's
keys to his house.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.830
Your home Auggie.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.310
- You know, maybe
staying at your place

32:44.353 --> 32:46.225
wasn't such a bad idea?

32:48.749 --> 32:50.185
- What's the matter,
are you uncomfortable?

32:50.229 --> 32:51.621
- Well--

32:51.665 --> 32:54.624
- Auggie, sometimes you
have to be uncomfortable

32:54.668 --> 32:56.148
to be comfortable.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.021
See you tomorrow.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.632
Nine a.m.

33:02.676 --> 33:03.503
- Right!

33:04.547 --> 33:06.071
Hey Mandy!

33:06.114 --> 33:07.072
- What!

33:07.115 --> 33:08.595
- What's the second key for?

33:08.638 --> 33:09.944
- I don't know.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.815
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.212
[kids laughing]

33:22.435 --> 33:26.047
- [Mike] Is there
anything else I should do?

33:28.615 --> 33:32.488
- No, let's just let the
situation play out for now.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.099
[solemn music]

33:34.142 --> 33:35.709
- [Mike] Very well.

33:41.019 --> 33:41.845
- Mike.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.416
Time is short.

33:50.637 --> 33:51.899
- I understand.

34:08.829 --> 34:12.311
[gentle determined music]

34:20.667 --> 34:21.494
- Tony!

34:24.497 --> 34:26.803
Tony, I know you're in here.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.199
Get out here this instant!

34:31.243 --> 34:32.809
This is ridiculous!

34:34.072 --> 34:34.898
Tony!

34:36.509 --> 34:37.336
Tony!

34:38.337 --> 34:39.120
Tony!

34:40.295 --> 34:41.470
Tony?

34:41.514 --> 34:43.429
- Hey Rhonda.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.779
- What kind of trouble have
you gotten August into?

34:45.822 --> 34:46.649
- Trouble, no?

49:57.211 --> 49:58.473
- What's going on?

49:58.517 --> 50:00.649
- This is Keeper's day
to go for a car ride

50:00.693 --> 50:02.912
and he sure appreciates
the volunteers

50:02.956 --> 50:04.088
who come every week.

50:04.131 --> 50:05.002
Don't you keeper?

50:05.045 --> 50:06.264
- I don't care.

50:06.307 --> 50:07.613
- Oh, don't you wanna
see Owl's Point?

50:07.656 --> 50:08.744
- I've seen it.

50:08.788 --> 50:09.963
Can we go back inside?

50:10.007 --> 50:11.399
- Oh come on, it'll be fun.

50:11.443 --> 50:13.227
This nice mans name is

50:17.101 --> 50:18.711
Harry.

50:18.754 --> 50:19.625
- Thanks.

50:21.192 --> 50:23.759
- Well Harry, she won't rest
until we get this over with.

50:23.803 --> 50:25.413
- Tell me about it.

50:25.457 --> 50:30.157
- Well what, are 12 clowns
gonna jump out of that tin can?

50:39.558 --> 50:41.081
- You two have fun.

50:42.952 --> 50:46.347
- [August] Hey, Mandy, I was
wondering if we could talk?

50:46.391 --> 50:48.088
- Sure, what is it?

50:48.132 --> 50:49.046
- Not here.

50:50.482 --> 50:52.484
I've some questions about
Keeper that I was hoping

50:52.527 --> 50:55.226
you might be able to shed
some light on.

50:55.269 --> 50:56.444
- I mean, I really don't
know much about him

50:56.488 --> 50:58.098
prior to his arrival
at the Nest.

50:58.142 --> 51:00.274
- Any insight would
be appreciated.

51:00.318 --> 51:00.927
- Okay.

51:02.494 --> 51:04.713
Tell you what, Olivia's
staying with a friend tonight,

51:04.757 --> 51:07.760
I can meet you at the
Bayview restaurant at seven.

51:07.803 --> 51:08.587
We could talk then.

51:08.630 --> 51:09.457
- Great.

51:09.501 --> 51:10.415
It's a date.

51:10.458 --> 51:12.373
[horn honking]

51:12.417 --> 51:14.723
- Hey, are we going or what?

51:14.767 --> 51:16.464
- Yeah, yeah we're going.

51:16.508 --> 51:17.726
Where, I don't know.

51:17.770 --> 51:19.380
- Well get a map.

51:19.424 --> 51:20.425
- [August] I have GPS.

51:20.468 --> 51:21.600
- You have what?

51:21.643 --> 51:25.821
- I said I have GPS!
[horns honking]

51:25.865 --> 51:27.693
- He says he has GPS.

51:27.736 --> 51:31.088
Is it legal to drive with
that condition?

51:32.176 --> 51:34.917
[engine turning]

51:43.970 --> 51:45.319
Stop!
[car screeching]

51:45.363 --> 51:46.146
- [August] What?

51:46.190 --> 51:46.973
What's wrong?

51:47.016 --> 51:47.974
- [Keeper] Not here.

51:48.017 --> 51:49.497
At the stop sign at the corner,

51:49.541 --> 51:51.543
I didn't want you to miss it.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.066
- [August] Thanks.

51:55.503 --> 51:58.071
- [Keeper] What are you doing?

51:58.115 --> 52:00.029
- [August] I have no idea.

52:00.073 --> 52:02.815
- [Keeper] That's
what I thought.

52:03.772 --> 52:05.818
Harry, what are we doing here?

52:07.211 --> 52:09.430
- I thought we'd take a
trip down memory lane.

52:09.474 --> 52:10.301
- Oh.

52:15.262 --> 52:16.307
- [August] When'd you get that?

52:16.350 --> 52:17.134
- 1972.

52:18.657 --> 52:20.180
- You remember.

52:20.224 --> 52:21.312
- It says it right here.

52:21.355 --> 52:22.617
Can't you read?

52:22.661 --> 52:24.793
"Regional Champions 1972."

52:26.230 --> 52:28.275
Boy, I had a 196 average.

52:30.016 --> 52:31.974
- That's right, you did.

52:33.324 --> 52:34.803
Who made this?

52:34.847 --> 52:36.501
- Oh, Auggie and I.

52:36.544 --> 52:38.111
Took us two months.

52:39.591 --> 52:40.679
- An hour every night.

52:40.722 --> 52:41.549
- Right.

52:43.421 --> 52:45.466
Auggie must be at school.

52:46.859 --> 52:48.121
- Yeah, school.

52:56.564 --> 52:58.175
Hey,

52:58.218 --> 52:59.088
what are these?

52:59.132 --> 52:59.959
- Oh.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.268
I don't know.

53:04.311 --> 53:06.879
Never seen 'em before, garbage.

53:15.235 --> 53:17.106
What are you doing?

53:17.150 --> 53:18.760
- I thought we'd take a
few things back.

53:18.804 --> 53:19.848
- Back where?

53:19.892 --> 53:21.937
- Back to your room.

53:21.981 --> 53:25.027
- My room is right
through that door.

53:26.899 --> 53:28.727
Auggie must be at school.

53:28.770 --> 53:30.032
- Can't you see
Auggie is right--

53:30.076 --> 53:31.904
- Harry, are you okay?

53:36.430 --> 53:37.214
- Yeah,

53:38.650 --> 53:39.477
I'm fine.

53:47.441 --> 53:48.573
Hey, you know,

53:49.791 --> 53:50.618
I think I know where we might

53:50.662 --> 53:52.403
be able to find Auggie.

53:52.446 --> 53:53.708
- Really?

53:53.752 --> 53:54.970
Well, let's go.

54:08.941 --> 54:11.770
[rustling waters]

54:25.653 --> 54:27.916
- Come on, let's go take a look.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.266
- [Keeper] What are
we doing here?

54:29.309 --> 54:31.442
- Looking to see if
Auggie is here.

54:31.485 --> 54:33.357
- You won't find him here.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.183
- Why not?

54:34.227 --> 54:36.360
- Auggie hates this place.

54:48.676 --> 54:49.460
Oh yeah.

54:51.592 --> 54:52.376
Yeah.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.253
- Go figure, it burns out
right when we walk in.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.255
- Oh, you see, right there.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.126
Right there is where Auggie said

55:04.170 --> 55:05.824
we were just actors.

55:07.129 --> 55:09.306
Can you believe it?

55:09.349 --> 55:11.482
- Yeah, that's awful.

55:11.525 --> 55:13.179
- What'd ya say?

55:13.222 --> 55:16.574
- Oh, I just said that maybe
Auggie changed his mind.

55:16.617 --> 55:19.707
Maybe he doesn't
hate this place.

55:19.751 --> 55:20.273
Oh.

55:21.492 --> 55:24.712
Looks like they started
the remodeling.

55:26.758 --> 55:28.107
That's right, they took
the light out

55:28.150 --> 55:29.891
and they're gonna put
in an observation deck.

55:29.935 --> 55:30.936
- Observation deck?

55:30.979 --> 55:31.806
For what?

55:31.850 --> 55:32.677
- For tourists.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.331
- Tourists?

55:34.374 --> 55:35.897
You're crazy.

55:35.941 --> 55:36.942
They can't do that.

55:36.985 --> 55:38.857
The light's too important.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.554
- Times change.

55:40.598 --> 55:41.512
- Yeah, yeah.

55:42.556 --> 55:45.820
There's something
here for Auggie.

55:45.864 --> 55:47.474
- What's here?

55:47.518 --> 55:48.954
- The light.

55:48.997 --> 55:51.260
- I just told you, the
light is gone.

55:51.304 --> 55:54.655
- Remind me to tell Auggie
that it's here.

55:54.699 --> 55:56.178
The light is here.

55:58.180 --> 56:00.661
Well, come on Harry, let's go.

56:05.536 --> 56:06.363
Harry!

56:08.147 --> 56:10.323
- Yeah, I'm coming Keeper.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.198
Well Keeper, we're back.

56:16.242 --> 56:17.939
Did you enjoy your trip?

56:17.983 --> 56:19.985
- Well, it wasn't the worst.

56:21.247 --> 56:24.076
- Would you like to do it
again sometime?

56:24.119 --> 56:25.207
- Maybe.

56:25.251 --> 56:27.645
- Well, at least
that isn't a no.

56:27.688 --> 56:28.602
Here, let's make sure you got

56:28.646 --> 56:29.647
all your treasures--

56:29.690 --> 56:31.039
[lighthouse clanking]

56:31.083 --> 56:31.997
- Look what you made me do.

56:32.040 --> 56:32.867
- Sorry.

56:32.911 --> 56:34.347
Here, let me help.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.914
- All right.

56:35.957 --> 56:38.003
Wait, what's this?

56:38.046 --> 56:39.396
- I don't know, what is it?

56:39.439 --> 56:40.701
- It's my marbles!

56:40.745 --> 56:42.268
[bag clanking]

56:42.311 --> 56:44.792
I thought I'd lost my marbles.

56:54.193 --> 56:56.761
[door ringing]

56:59.633 --> 57:02.244
- [Kate] Can I help you?

57:02.288 --> 57:04.638
- Yes, I'm Special Agent Ketchum

57:04.682 --> 57:05.987
and this is Agent Howard.

57:06.031 --> 57:07.424
We're with the FBI.

57:07.467 --> 57:09.208
- Farm Bureau?

57:09.251 --> 57:12.037
- Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.212
We're looking for someone who

57:13.255 --> 57:15.344
may have past through
town recently.

57:15.388 --> 57:16.998
- Agent Ketchum?

57:17.042 --> 57:18.652
You're kidding, right?

57:18.696 --> 57:20.872
- I don't understand.

57:20.915 --> 57:23.309
- Of course you don't.

57:23.352 --> 57:25.137
- We're looking for someone who

57:25.180 --> 57:27.705
may have been driving this car.

57:29.271 --> 57:31.012
- I didn't see any car.

57:32.144 --> 57:33.711
- Well, anybody come
in that seemed

57:33.754 --> 57:36.409
like he was from out of town?

57:36.453 --> 57:39.020
- You mean espresso boy?

57:39.064 --> 57:39.934
- Excuse me?

57:41.283 --> 57:43.764
- The fella that left
you with that $50 tip.

57:43.808 --> 57:47.159
- Oh yeah, there was this
handsome fella.

57:47.202 --> 57:49.074
- He wore a baseball cap

57:49.117 --> 57:50.554
and dark sunglasses.

57:50.597 --> 57:52.251
- Sunglasses inside.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.514
That's odd.

57:54.558 --> 57:55.384
- You think?

57:56.560 --> 57:58.910
Must've been trying to
hide something.

57:58.953 --> 58:00.085
- What did he do?

58:00.128 --> 58:01.434
- Just drank his coffee.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.088
- Anything else?

58:03.131 --> 58:05.003
- No, just drank his coffee

58:05.046 --> 58:08.093
and talked on the phone
the entire time.

58:08.136 --> 58:08.963
- To whom?

58:09.007 --> 58:10.443
Who did he talk to?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.750
- Well, if I recall,

58:12.793 --> 58:16.188
the conversation was with
somebody he called boss.

58:16.231 --> 58:17.668
- Boss?

58:17.711 --> 58:21.802
- Said he was going to
make a drop in Las Vegas.

58:21.846 --> 58:23.064
- Really?

58:23.108 --> 58:24.413
Is that all?

58:24.457 --> 58:26.241
- Well pretty much.

58:26.285 --> 58:27.460
For that call.

58:28.461 --> 58:29.593
- There was another call?

58:29.636 --> 58:30.768
- Yup.

58:30.811 --> 58:32.378
Someone thought it was important

58:32.421 --> 58:35.512
that he knew there
was an escape.

58:35.555 --> 58:36.382
- Escape?

58:38.906 --> 58:39.690
Well, thank you.

58:39.733 --> 58:41.779
You've been most helpful.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.306
- You won't find him
in Las Vegas.

58:50.396 --> 58:51.963
- And, why not son?

58:53.704 --> 58:55.619
- Because I know where he went.

58:55.662 --> 58:56.533
- [August] And do you
know how to get to

58:56.576 --> 58:58.404
Owl's Point Wisconsin?

59:00.058 --> 59:01.276
- [Boy] Oh yeah, yeah.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.495
So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna

59:02.539 --> 59:05.716
take this road down to
Highway 151 North.

59:16.204 --> 59:17.031
- Evening.

59:17.075 --> 59:18.119
- Hi, Mandy Benson?

59:18.163 --> 59:19.599
- Yes, Benson right here.

59:19.643 --> 59:20.948
- Thank you.

59:20.992 --> 59:22.297
I'm sorry I'm late.

59:22.341 --> 59:23.560
I wanted to pick
these up for you

59:23.603 --> 59:26.171
to thank you for
everything you've done.

59:26.214 --> 59:27.172
- How sweet of you.

59:27.215 --> 59:29.261
They're beautiful.

59:29.304 --> 59:30.392
But you shouldn't have.

59:30.436 --> 59:32.264
- Hey, where are mine?

59:33.526 --> 59:34.919
- August, this is Martha.

59:34.962 --> 59:37.574
She is a resident at the
Owl's Rest Nursing Home.

59:37.617 --> 59:40.577
She has known Keeper
for many years.

59:41.795 --> 59:42.883
- Hi Auggie.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.406
- Hi Martha.

59:44.450 --> 59:45.277
- Have a seat.

59:45.320 --> 59:46.626
Take a load off.

59:54.112 --> 59:55.417
- I thought Martha could
shed some light

59:55.461 --> 59:58.986
on Keeper's life after
you left Owl's Point.

1:00:00.074 --> 1:00:00.901
Here's a menu.

1:00:00.945 --> 1:00:01.728
- Thanks.

1:00:01.772 --> 1:00:02.729
Good idea.

1:00:02.773 --> 1:00:03.643
I guess.

1:00:03.687 --> 1:00:05.558
- You were right Mandy.

1:00:05.602 --> 1:00:06.254
- Right about what?

1:00:06.298 --> 1:00:07.516
- Nothing.

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:10.476
- You are even better
looking in person.

1:00:10.519 --> 1:00:11.346
- Really?

1:00:12.826 --> 1:00:15.307
And so are you Martha.

1:00:15.350 --> 1:00:16.177
- You dog!

1:00:17.439 --> 1:00:20.138
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

1:00:26.405 --> 1:00:29.408
- Martha, why don't you
take a look at the menu.

1:00:29.451 --> 1:00:32.585
We should probably choose
what we're gonna eat tonight.

1:00:32.629 --> 1:00:36.023
Although I've suddenly
lost my appetite.

1:00:36.067 --> 1:00:37.938
- Until Keeper started to,

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:40.158
well, you know, forget things.

1:00:41.550 --> 1:00:44.684
He could tell almost
anything about marine life

1:00:44.728 --> 1:00:46.643
on the Great Lakes.

1:00:46.686 --> 1:00:48.383
- Don't I know it.

1:00:48.427 --> 1:00:51.386
- He would always say, "I don't
have to go see the world."--

1:00:51.430 --> 1:00:53.388
- The world always
comes to see me.

1:00:53.432 --> 1:00:54.607
- That's right.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.914
From his advantage point

1:00:56.957 --> 1:00:59.394
on top of that lighthouse,

1:00:59.438 --> 1:01:03.572
he saw the ships from all
over the world.

1:01:03.616 --> 1:01:06.227
He met Captains and their crews.

1:01:07.533 --> 1:01:11.015
He insists that one time
during a full moon--

1:01:11.058 --> 1:01:14.366
- In 1965, he spied a
Russian submarine.

1:01:16.673 --> 1:01:17.325
Heard it!

1:01:18.631 --> 1:01:21.373
- Look Auggie, I'm sorry
I can't provide you

1:01:21.416 --> 1:01:24.550
with any new
information about Keeper.

1:01:25.943 --> 1:01:28.728
- I'm sure August
appreciates your time

1:01:28.772 --> 1:01:32.079
and for being a good
friend to Keeper.

1:01:32.123 --> 1:01:33.124
- Yes, I do.

1:01:35.866 --> 1:01:37.345
Thank you, Martha.

1:01:38.782 --> 1:01:40.871
It's just that, well,

1:01:40.914 --> 1:01:44.918
last night, I came across
these at Keepers cabin.

1:01:48.661 --> 1:01:50.532
- They're theater tickets.

1:01:50.576 --> 1:01:52.186
Unused.

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:55.537
- For the opening night of
every city I've ever played.

1:01:55.581 --> 1:01:57.583
- It was nice of you
to invite him.

1:01:57.626 --> 1:02:00.151
- That's just it, I didn't.

1:02:00.194 --> 1:02:01.630
- How do you think he got them?

1:02:01.674 --> 1:02:03.415
- I don't know.

1:02:03.458 --> 1:02:05.547
I don't mean to brag but,

1:02:05.591 --> 1:02:08.289
most of these tickets
sold for a small fortune.

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:10.465
- I can see that.

1:02:10.509 --> 1:02:11.902
- Martha, did Keeper ever
mention anything

1:02:11.945 --> 1:02:13.686
to you about tickets?

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:16.907
- Not specifically.

1:02:16.950 --> 1:02:18.430
- What do you mean, "not
specifically?"

1:02:18.473 --> 1:02:21.389
- I mean, he never
mentioned tickets,

1:02:21.433 --> 1:02:23.696
but he did always know
where you were,

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.350
what show you were in,

1:02:25.393 --> 1:02:28.353
and how well you did
in the reviews.

1:02:29.441 --> 1:02:31.051
- Power of the internet.

1:02:31.095 --> 1:02:32.444
- Right.

1:02:32.487 --> 1:02:34.054
The internet.

1:02:34.098 --> 1:02:35.273
Keeper?

1:02:35.316 --> 1:02:38.015
The closest he ever got
to a computer

1:02:38.058 --> 1:02:41.105
was the timer on his
coffee maker.

1:02:41.148 --> 1:02:44.238
And it usually started brewing
at three in the morning.

1:02:44.282 --> 1:02:46.893
No, the net Keeper ever knew was

1:02:48.025 --> 1:02:49.853
on a fishing boat.

1:02:49.896 --> 1:02:52.333
- Well, then I guess
the case of the

1:02:52.377 --> 1:02:56.076
unused theater tickets
will remain a mystery.

1:02:59.732 --> 1:03:00.559
Who cares.

1:03:02.082 --> 1:03:04.389
- It would seem that you do.

1:03:08.219 --> 1:03:11.570
This place has the best
blueberry pie.

1:03:11.613 --> 1:03:14.878
Are you sure you two
don't want a piece?

1:03:17.097 --> 1:03:20.579
Have you tried contacting
Keeper's sister?

1:03:21.928 --> 1:03:22.755
- What?

1:03:24.713 --> 1:03:25.627
- [Martha] Keepers sister.

1:03:25.671 --> 1:03:27.978
To shed light on the tickets.

1:03:29.283 --> 1:03:31.590
- Martha, what are you
talking about?

1:03:31.633 --> 1:03:33.679
- Keeper's sister.

1:03:33.722 --> 1:03:35.855
You know, Auggie's mother.

1:03:38.075 --> 1:03:39.032
- My mother?

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:45.212
- You didn't know that Keeper
is actually your Uncle,

1:03:46.953 --> 1:03:47.780
did you?

1:03:53.177 --> 1:03:54.743
More coffee please.

1:04:02.969 --> 1:04:04.014
- [August] All right
Keeper of secrets,

1:04:04.057 --> 1:04:04.841
you've got company.

1:04:04.884 --> 1:04:05.842
- Sir!

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.104
Please sign in.

1:04:08.757 --> 1:04:10.020
- When you sleep 20 hours a day

1:04:10.063 --> 1:04:12.196
what's 15 minutes of lost rest?

1:04:12.239 --> 1:04:12.849
Right?

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:15.286
All right, let's really
test your memory

1:04:15.329 --> 1:04:18.811
and see what lies you
can muster this time.

1:04:21.335 --> 1:04:22.119
[door knocking]

1:04:22.162 --> 1:04:23.816
Keeper, it's August!

1:04:30.344 --> 1:04:33.217
[slow paced music]

1:05:17.478 --> 1:05:18.305
Keeper!

1:05:25.095 --> 1:05:25.878
Keeper?

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:27.532
- Huh?

1:05:27.575 --> 1:05:28.881
- Keeper, is that you?

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:30.404
- Auggie?

1:05:30.448 --> 1:05:31.275
Watch out for the pirate.

1:05:31.318 --> 1:05:32.406
- Pirate--

1:05:32.450 --> 1:05:36.976
[hammer thudding]
[August grunting]

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:39.979
[thunder crackling]

1:05:41.589 --> 1:05:43.548
- Auggie, hurry it up!

1:05:43.591 --> 1:05:44.766
Time is short!

1:05:44.810 --> 1:05:46.594
- [Auggie] I hate this place.

1:05:46.638 --> 1:05:49.380
- And here comes the
next big thing.

1:05:49.423 --> 1:05:51.164
August Star.

1:05:51.208 --> 1:05:53.384
Remember, what's hot today

1:05:53.427 --> 1:05:56.953
can just as easily become
what's not, tomorrow.

1:05:56.996 --> 1:05:58.737
- If there is any time you could

1:05:58.780 --> 1:06:00.434
come to visit your father,

1:06:00.478 --> 1:06:03.046
I would recommend you do it now.

1:06:03.089 --> 1:06:05.309
Owl's Point is sort
of a roundabout

1:06:05.352 --> 1:06:07.050
way to Hollywood,
wouldn't you say.

1:06:07.093 --> 1:06:10.531
Tell me August the Star,
what's out there?

1:06:12.577 --> 1:06:14.840
What's out there that
can't be found right?

1:06:14.883 --> 1:06:16.015
- What's real?

1:06:17.408 --> 1:06:20.672
Real is what you
pretend real to be.

1:06:20.715 --> 1:06:22.761
- I don't know you.

1:06:22.804 --> 1:06:24.371
That's not my son.

1:06:24.415 --> 1:06:25.416
What did he tell you!

1:06:25.459 --> 1:06:26.591
Get him out of here!

1:06:26.634 --> 1:06:29.115
- Keeper does remember you,
Auggie.

1:06:29.159 --> 1:06:32.075
But to him you're a teenager.

1:06:32.118 --> 1:06:33.728
Sometimes you have to
be uncomfortable

1:06:33.772 --> 1:06:35.165
to be comfortable.

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:37.297
- You were thinking about
your Mother, but she--

1:06:37.341 --> 1:06:38.124
- I hate her.

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:39.952
- You won't find him here.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:40.779
- Why not?

1:06:40.822 --> 1:06:43.434
- Auggie hates this place.

1:06:43.477 --> 1:06:45.131
- Keeper's sister.

1:06:45.175 --> 1:06:47.307
You know, Auggie's Mother.

1:06:49.527 --> 1:06:51.485
- [August] My Mother?

1:06:51.529 --> 1:06:54.227
[August coughing]

1:06:54.271 --> 1:06:55.228
Ow, my head.

1:06:56.708 --> 1:06:57.926
- Auggie?

1:06:57.970 --> 1:06:59.624
Auggie is that you?

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:00.842
- Where are we?

1:07:00.886 --> 1:07:02.279
- The lighthouse.

1:07:03.715 --> 1:07:08.328
Red skies in the morning,
sailors take warning.

1:07:08.372 --> 1:07:10.939
There's a storm a coming.

1:07:10.983 --> 1:07:13.029
- I think it already hit.

1:07:14.552 --> 1:07:16.423
- Those pirate friends of yours,

1:07:16.467 --> 1:07:18.338
they play a little rough.

1:07:18.382 --> 1:07:19.165
- Pirates?

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:23.300
- Not very creative though.

1:07:23.343 --> 1:07:26.172
The best they could
come up with to say was,

1:07:26.216 --> 1:07:27.608
"Where's the loot?

1:07:27.652 --> 1:07:29.219
"Where's the loot?"

1:07:30.829 --> 1:07:32.091
- Where are they?

1:07:32.135 --> 1:07:34.528
- Well, I told them
where the loot was.

1:07:34.572 --> 1:07:35.486
- Where?

1:07:35.529 --> 1:07:36.922
- Where else?

1:07:36.965 --> 1:07:38.706
In my treasure chest.

1:07:42.667 --> 1:07:44.321
- Hey, what is this?

1:07:48.934 --> 1:07:51.589
- It's kind of a dumb thing

1:07:51.632 --> 1:07:54.026
to scavenger for though.

1:07:54.070 --> 1:07:56.681
I can't remember the
last time I played it.

1:07:56.724 --> 1:07:57.725
- Your lute.

1:07:58.596 --> 1:07:59.945
- [Both Men] Oh!

1:08:01.207 --> 1:08:01.990
- [August] Sorry.

1:08:02.034 --> 1:08:04.210
- Auggie, are you okay?

1:08:04.254 --> 1:08:06.299
- Why are you calling me Auggie?

1:08:06.343 --> 1:08:08.040
- Well that's your name.

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:11.043
Are we being some kind
of characters?

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:12.349
Sir Francis Drake?

1:08:13.698 --> 1:08:17.397
Sir Walter Raleigh how
can I be your service.

1:08:19.138 --> 1:08:20.748
- No, Auggie's fine.

1:08:20.792 --> 1:08:22.750
- Okay, as you wish sir.

1:08:27.799 --> 1:08:29.017
- Dad.

1:08:29.061 --> 1:08:30.541
- Huh?

1:08:30.584 --> 1:08:31.803
- What happens when the
pirates figure out

1:08:31.846 --> 1:08:34.066
that the loot is your lute?

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:36.590
- Well, they,

1:08:37.548 --> 1:08:39.724
they said something about

1:08:39.767 --> 1:08:42.727
coming back here to
finish the game.

1:08:43.597 --> 1:08:44.990
I wish they would hurry.

1:08:45.033 --> 1:08:47.035
It's cold, cold in here.

1:08:48.559 --> 1:08:49.995
I'm tired.

1:08:50.038 --> 1:08:51.344
- Hey, hang in there Dad.

1:08:51.388 --> 1:08:53.346
- [Keeper] I'm so tired.

1:08:58.438 --> 1:09:02.355
- It's been a long time
since I've been up there.

1:09:02.399 --> 1:09:03.269
- Up where?

1:09:04.618 --> 1:09:06.011
- The lantern room.

1:09:06.054 --> 1:09:06.794
- Oh.

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:11.451
Not a big fan of
lighthouses, are you Auggie?

1:09:11.495 --> 1:09:12.713
- I wouldn't say that.

1:09:12.757 --> 1:09:13.584
- I would.

1:09:14.628 --> 1:09:15.629
- [August] Well, it doesn't help

1:09:15.673 --> 1:09:18.284
when you have a fear of heights.

1:09:18.328 --> 1:09:19.981
- A fear of heights?

1:09:20.895 --> 1:09:22.593
I never knew that.

1:09:22.636 --> 1:09:24.334
- Yeah, I should have
told you earlier.

1:09:24.377 --> 1:09:26.336
- Well, it doesn't matter,
does it?

1:09:26.379 --> 1:09:27.163
- It does when you're supposed

1:09:27.206 --> 1:09:29.295
to be a lighthouse keeper.

1:09:29.339 --> 1:09:31.036
- Yeah, but,

1:09:31.079 --> 1:09:33.778
you're never gonna be a
lighthouse keeper

1:09:33.821 --> 1:09:35.083
are you Auggie?

1:09:36.607 --> 1:09:37.434
- No Dad.

1:09:39.479 --> 1:09:40.828
- Well good.

1:09:40.872 --> 1:09:44.484
You have to follow your
dreams for your life,

1:09:45.659 --> 1:09:47.879
not someone else's.

1:09:47.922 --> 1:09:49.141
- My life?

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:49.924
- Yeah.

1:09:50.882 --> 1:09:53.406
What is it you wanna do again?

1:09:53.450 --> 1:09:54.755
- Act.

1:09:54.799 --> 1:09:56.844
- Oh, that's right.

1:09:56.888 --> 1:09:59.325
Well, [heavy breathing]

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:03.547
you were pretty good in
that last play of yours.

1:10:03.590 --> 1:10:04.417
- Really?

1:10:04.461 --> 1:10:05.766
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1:10:06.898 --> 1:10:08.073
I'll huff and I'll puff

1:10:08.116 --> 1:10:11.381
and I'll blow your house down.

1:10:11.424 --> 1:10:13.470
By golly, Auggie you did.

1:10:14.862 --> 1:10:16.037
- Fifth grade.

1:10:17.343 --> 1:10:18.910
Thanks.

1:10:18.953 --> 1:10:22.043
- Auggie, there's one thing
you have to promise me.

1:10:22.087 --> 1:10:23.523
- What's that?

1:10:23.567 --> 1:10:26.134
- No matter where you go,

1:10:26.178 --> 1:10:28.746
Auggie take the light with you.

1:10:30.748 --> 1:10:32.837
- How is that even possible?

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:35.100
- Oh Auggie, all things are,

1:10:36.275 --> 1:10:39.496
all things are
possible through Him,

1:10:39.539 --> 1:10:41.411
who gives us strength.

1:10:41.454 --> 1:10:43.369
- Even raising a kid
all by yourself?

1:10:43.413 --> 1:10:45.284
- Well, I'm trying.

1:10:45.328 --> 1:10:47.460
- You're doing a good job.

1:10:50.768 --> 1:10:51.595
Hey,

1:10:54.337 --> 1:10:57.557
what can you tell me
about your sister?

1:10:59.864 --> 1:11:02.170
- Beautiful, beautiful girl.

1:11:03.215 --> 1:11:04.042
Beautiful.

1:11:05.783 --> 1:11:08.307
You know, my parents, after me,

1:11:10.483 --> 1:11:13.617
I think they decided to
call it quits.

1:11:16.446 --> 1:11:18.709
But eventually, I
guess they forgot

1:11:18.752 --> 1:11:20.885
about all the trouble I was

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:25.629
and 16 years later, if you
can believe it,

1:11:27.370 --> 1:11:28.675
along came Lily.

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:33.419
- Lily?

1:11:33.463 --> 1:11:34.290
- Yeah.

1:11:36.335 --> 1:11:37.945
- Where is she?

1:11:37.989 --> 1:11:40.600
- Well, Lily herself in trouble.

1:11:42.341 --> 1:11:45.823
She [Keeper coughing],

1:11:45.866 --> 1:11:47.390
she made a mistake.

1:11:48.608 --> 1:11:50.262
- Am I that mistake?

1:11:52.743 --> 1:11:54.310
- No.

1:11:54.353 --> 1:11:55.615
No.

1:11:55.659 --> 1:11:56.877
You are my son.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.319
Oh Auggie, I'm so tired.

1:12:04.407 --> 1:12:05.408
- Stay with me Dad.

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:07.105
- So tired.

1:12:07.148 --> 1:12:08.062
- Hey, Dad.

1:12:09.281 --> 1:12:10.500
You remember this one?

1:12:10.543 --> 1:12:11.631

1:13:20.831 --> 1:13:22.136
- Just go back to sleep Dad.

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:23.007
- Huh?

- August!

1:13:32.843 --> 1:13:33.670
- Rhonda?

1:13:33.713 --> 1:13:34.540
What's going on?

1:13:34.584 --> 1:13:35.541
- FBI.

1:13:35.585 --> 1:13:36.847
- Thank God you're alive.

1:13:36.890 --> 1:13:38.326
- How'd you find us?

1:13:38.370 --> 1:13:41.242
- Well, brains don't exactly
run in Tony's family.

1:13:41.286 --> 1:13:43.984
When the FBI went to
your Dad's house,

1:13:44.028 --> 1:13:46.726
they found us and the car
in the driveway.

1:13:46.770 --> 1:13:48.032
- And then you came here?

1:13:48.075 --> 1:13:49.555
- No, the nursing home.

1:13:49.599 --> 1:13:52.079
That little lighthouse lamp
you left in the window,

1:13:52.123 --> 1:13:53.080
it was an awesome clue.

1:13:53.124 --> 1:13:54.691
That was really great thinking.

1:13:54.734 --> 1:13:57.650
- I didn't leave a lamp
in the window.

1:13:57.694 --> 1:13:59.609
- He's burning up!
[Keeper groans]

1:13:59.652 --> 1:14:00.436
- Auggie.

1:14:01.654 --> 1:14:02.438
- Yeah.

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:04.701
- [Keeper] Is the game over?

1:14:04.744 --> 1:14:05.876
- Yeah.

1:14:05.919 --> 1:14:06.746
It's over.

1:14:09.706 --> 1:14:10.837
- Who are you?

1:14:12.535 --> 1:14:13.971
Where's Auggie!

1:14:14.014 --> 1:14:16.321
- Let's get him out of here.

1:14:22.283 --> 1:14:23.850
- The game is over.

1:14:24.808 --> 1:14:26.636
- Not quite yet.

1:14:26.679 --> 1:14:27.898
- Excuse me?

1:14:27.941 --> 1:14:31.118
- Mr. Star, I have some
questions for you.

1:14:31.162 --> 1:14:32.380
- Like?

1:14:32.424 --> 1:14:35.471
- Like, for instance,
where are they?

1:14:35.514 --> 1:14:36.907
- Where are what?

1:14:38.778 --> 1:14:40.388
- The diamonds?

1:14:40.432 --> 1:14:41.346
- Diamonds?

1:14:53.358 --> 1:14:54.490
- What's going on over there?

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:55.447
- I don't know.

1:14:55.491 --> 1:14:56.840
Some sort of interrogation?

1:14:56.883 --> 1:15:01.497
- All right, let's calmly
try to go over this all.

1:15:01.540 --> 1:15:03.020
- One more time.

1:15:03.063 --> 1:15:05.065
We've been at this for hours.

1:15:05.109 --> 1:15:08.068
We've searched the house,
Keeper's room,

1:15:08.112 --> 1:15:10.201
the car, the lighthouse.

1:15:10.244 --> 1:15:11.985
I have no idea where
the diamonds are!

1:15:12.029 --> 1:15:14.466
- Mr. Star, if you
refuse to cooperate,

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:16.512
we'll just take you in
for further questioning.

1:15:16.555 --> 1:15:17.338
- What?

1:15:17.382 --> 1:15:18.688
Arrest me?

1:15:18.731 --> 1:15:20.167
I'm a victim in all of this!

1:15:20.211 --> 1:15:21.865
- The diamonds were in
your possession

1:15:21.908 --> 1:15:23.040
when they disappeared.

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:25.085
- What do you mean,
"Disappeared?"

1:15:25.129 --> 1:15:26.304
How can something disappear

1:15:26.347 --> 1:15:28.088
that I never saw in
the first place?

1:15:28.132 --> 1:15:29.481
- How convenient.

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:32.397
- Look, this is all a
big misunderstanding.

1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:35.792
Why would I drive a car
full of hot diamonds

1:15:35.835 --> 1:15:36.619
all the way to--

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:37.271
- Las Vegas!

1:15:37.315 --> 1:15:38.664
- Vegas!

1:15:38.708 --> 1:15:40.666
- So you admit you were
headed to Las Vegas?

1:15:40.710 --> 1:15:42.276
- Yes, to deliver the car.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.277
- With the diamonds.

1:15:43.321 --> 1:15:44.714
- What diamonds?

1:15:44.757 --> 1:15:46.629
- So you didn't go to Vegas?

1:15:46.672 --> 1:15:47.630
- That's right.

1:15:47.673 --> 1:15:48.544
- That was your mistake August!

1:15:48.587 --> 1:15:50.589
The plan was to go to Vegas!

1:15:50.633 --> 1:15:51.416
- The plan?

1:15:51.459 --> 1:15:52.243
- There was--

1:15:52.286 --> 1:15:53.113
- I see.

1:15:53.157 --> 1:15:54.027
- There was no plan.

1:15:54.071 --> 1:15:55.159
- Yes there was!

1:15:55.202 --> 1:15:56.813
My cousin's plan!

1:15:56.856 --> 1:15:58.945
Which obviously neither August

1:15:58.989 --> 1:16:01.557
nor I had any part in planning.

1:16:03.036 --> 1:16:04.690
I mean, just the execution.

1:16:04.734 --> 1:16:06.039
- The execution?

1:16:06.910 --> 1:16:07.737
I see.

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:09.521
- I see, you see nothing!

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:11.001
Tony!

1:16:11.044 --> 1:16:12.480
Stop talking!

1:16:12.524 --> 1:16:14.221
- Maybe you both should
stop talking.

1:16:14.265 --> 1:16:16.484
At least until an
attorney is present.

1:16:16.528 --> 1:16:17.660
I'll call Bernie.

1:16:17.703 --> 1:16:20.358
- Bernie is an
entertainment lawyer.

1:16:20.401 --> 1:16:23.274
We're not negotiating a
three picture deal here.

1:16:23.317 --> 1:16:25.972
- Wait a minute, this
would make a great movie.

1:16:26.016 --> 1:16:28.279
Whatever you do, do not
surrender the story rights.

1:16:28.322 --> 1:16:29.759
- Hold on!

1:16:29.802 --> 1:16:30.890
This is my story too, I
set the whole thing up!

1:16:30.934 --> 1:16:33.980
- You heard him, he
just confessed.

1:16:34.024 --> 1:16:34.633
Lock him up.

1:16:34.677 --> 1:16:36.026
- Did not Rhonda!

1:16:36.069 --> 1:16:37.941
You just wanna keep me
from a producers credit!

1:16:37.984 --> 1:16:39.116
- Producers credit?

1:16:39.159 --> 1:16:40.334
The day you get a
producer's credit--

1:16:40.378 --> 1:16:42.859
- Can everyone please
just settle down?

1:16:42.902 --> 1:16:44.382
You're agitating the residents.

1:16:44.425 --> 1:16:46.689
- Oh, no need to stop
on our account.

1:16:46.732 --> 1:16:48.255
We haven't had so much fun since

1:16:48.299 --> 1:16:51.607
Homer knocked off the
pharmacy on Mardi Gras night!

1:16:51.650 --> 1:16:54.653
- It was not one of our
finest hours.

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:57.134
- Back to your game boys.

1:16:57.177 --> 1:16:58.178
- Yes ma'am.

1:17:03.923 --> 1:17:06.839
- Homer only got away
with a case of laxatives.

1:17:06.883 --> 1:17:08.145
It's not as bad as it sounds.

1:17:08.188 --> 1:17:09.842
- It's not bad if you
want wall to wall--

1:17:09.886 --> 1:17:12.105
- Back to your game Winnie.

1:17:15.021 --> 1:17:16.327
- Well, without the
jewels in hand,

1:17:16.370 --> 1:17:18.155
we can't let you go
until it is proven

1:17:18.198 --> 1:17:19.417
that there was no colluding.

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:20.244
- Colluding?

1:17:20.287 --> 1:17:22.333
- Or obstruction.

1:17:22.376 --> 1:17:23.203
Gentlemen.

1:17:24.335 --> 1:17:25.902
- What are you doing?

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:27.251
- You have a right to
remain silent--

1:17:27.294 --> 1:17:28.208
- You're kidding me, right?

1:17:28.252 --> 1:17:29.427
- [Ketchum] No, I wish I was.

1:17:29.470 --> 1:17:30.471
- Anything you say can
and will be held

1:17:30.515 --> 1:17:31.559
against you in a court of law.

1:17:31.603 --> 1:17:32.822
- He's not kidding either.

1:17:32.865 --> 1:17:34.084
You know, I had a buddy
who didn't know

1:17:34.127 --> 1:17:35.563
he was being recorded by
some stool pigeon

1:17:35.607 --> 1:17:36.390
so he said--

1:17:36.434 --> 1:17:37.391
- Shut up Tony!

1:17:37.435 --> 1:17:38.175
- Fine, fine.

1:17:38.218 --> 1:17:39.350
My lips are sealed.

1:17:39.393 --> 1:17:41.395
Unless, unless I can
work a plea deal.

1:17:41.439 --> 1:17:42.222
Yeah?

1:17:42.266 --> 1:17:43.180
I could.

1:17:43.223 --> 1:17:44.703
Hey, it's nothing personal.

1:17:44.747 --> 1:17:46.139
- [Howard] You have a
right to an attorney--

1:17:46.183 --> 1:17:47.619
- Not Bernie.

1:17:47.663 --> 1:17:48.402
- If you cannot
afford an attorney

1:17:48.446 --> 1:17:49.621
one will be provided--

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:51.841
- Excuse me please,
coming through.

1:17:51.884 --> 1:17:53.799
- Hello Martha, how
are you today?

1:17:53.843 --> 1:17:55.671
- I'm still breathing.

1:17:55.714 --> 1:17:56.846
I'd love to stay and talk,

1:17:56.889 --> 1:17:59.413
but I'm late for craft class!

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:00.806
Hi Auggie.

1:18:00.850 --> 1:18:01.981
- Martha.

1:18:02.025 --> 1:18:04.027
- Well, don't let us
stand in your way.

1:18:04.070 --> 1:18:05.898
- Last time I made
this necklace.

1:18:05.942 --> 1:18:07.334
- Oh, it's beautiful.

1:18:07.378 --> 1:18:10.424
- This time I'm going to
make matching earrings.

1:18:10.468 --> 1:18:13.471
If Sophie didn't take all
the good bling.

1:18:13.514 --> 1:18:15.168
She's a hoarder you know.

1:18:15.212 --> 1:18:16.300
- Oh, there there Martha.

1:18:16.343 --> 1:18:18.041
- Carry on.

1:18:18.084 --> 1:18:20.826
- [Howard] As I was saying, you
have a right to an attorney.

Agent Ketchum.

1:18:34.057 --> 1:18:35.536
- [Martha] Am I too
late for the good ones?

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:37.277
- No, no Martha, right on time.

1:18:37.321 --> 1:18:38.496
Now everyone, don't forget
to thank Keeper

1:18:38.539 --> 1:18:40.498
for donating his bag of
broken marbles

1:18:40.541 --> 1:18:42.065
to our craft time.

1:18:42.108 --> 1:18:45.198
- All right then, let them go.

1:18:45.242 --> 1:18:46.722
- Can I make a pair of earrings?

1:18:46.765 --> 1:18:48.158
Just a small pair.

1:18:48.201 --> 1:18:49.028
Nevermind.

1:18:50.508 --> 1:18:52.728
- So, what do we have here?

1:19:02.825 --> 1:19:03.869
- What is it?

1:19:05.697 --> 1:19:06.742

1:19:06.785 --> 1:19:07.568
- What are you talking about?

1:19:07.612 --> 1:19:08.395
We had dinner.

1:19:08.439 --> 1:19:10.658
- A Martha free dinner.

1:19:10.702 --> 1:19:12.356
- August, I don't
think we should--

1:19:12.399 --> 1:19:14.184
- Or I could ask Agent
Ketchum to take

1:19:14.227 --> 1:19:17.317
a closer look into the
laxative Mardi Gras caper.

1:19:17.361 --> 1:19:19.319
- That's blackmail.

1:19:19.363 --> 1:19:21.757
- No, no, that's desperation.

1:19:23.541 --> 1:19:24.847
- Okay.

1:19:24.890 --> 1:19:26.283
I'll get my coat.

1:19:27.850 --> 1:19:28.807
- The light.

1:19:28.851 --> 1:19:29.677
- [August] Keeper!

1:19:29.721 --> 1:19:31.070
- The light.

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:32.332
The light!

1:19:32.376 --> 1:19:33.203
- Code blue!

1:19:33.246 --> 1:19:34.944
We need help here!

1:19:34.987 --> 1:19:36.684
- Dad? Dad?
- Code blue!

1:19:36.728 --> 1:19:38.251
Keeper?
- Code blue!

1:19:38.295 --> 1:19:39.600
Hey.
- Code blue!

1:19:41.602 --> 1:19:42.778
- [Amanda] What's his status?

1:19:42.821 --> 1:19:44.388
- His pulse is low,

1:19:44.431 --> 1:19:46.129
he's having
difficulty breathing.

1:19:46.172 --> 1:19:47.478
Pneumonia.

1:19:47.521 --> 1:19:48.305
I don't think he's gonna--

1:19:48.348 --> 1:19:49.175
- Shh.

1:20:02.145 --> 1:20:02.928
- Keeper.

1:20:04.277 --> 1:20:05.104
Dad.

1:20:06.932 --> 1:20:07.759
- Auggie.

1:20:09.326 --> 1:20:10.588
- I'm here Dad.

1:20:11.589 --> 1:20:13.025
- The light.

1:20:13.069 --> 1:20:14.548
- It's me, Auggie.

1:20:23.470 --> 1:20:25.777
- The light, need the light.

1:20:32.131 --> 1:20:32.958
- I...

1:20:34.742 --> 1:20:35.831
- What is it August?

1:20:35.874 --> 1:20:37.528
- I can't stay here.

1:20:38.616 --> 1:20:39.617
I have to go.

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:40.836
- What are you talking about?

1:20:40.879 --> 1:20:41.967
What are you doing?

1:20:42.011 --> 1:20:43.751
- [August] I have to
do something.

1:20:43.795 --> 1:20:45.318
- [Amanda] You have to
stay with your Father.

1:20:45.362 --> 1:20:46.929
- I'll explain later.

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:47.799
- August,

1:20:49.714 --> 1:20:53.152
I don't think there's
going to be a later.

1:20:54.501 --> 1:20:55.154
August,

1:20:56.329 --> 1:20:57.417
what could possibly be
more important

1:20:57.461 --> 1:20:58.810
than being here?

1:21:00.464 --> 1:21:01.639
- Being there.

1:21:12.215 --> 1:21:13.172
- August!

1:21:13.216 --> 1:21:14.260
- Rhonda, stay with him, please?

1:21:14.304 --> 1:21:15.087
- I have to tell you something--

1:21:15.131 --> 1:21:17.176
- Rhonda, please!

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:18.047
- Okay.

1:21:19.657 --> 1:21:20.440
- August.

1:21:20.484 --> 1:21:21.833
- I have to go.

1:21:21.877 --> 1:21:23.182
- I know you do.

1:21:29.362 --> 1:21:30.886
- Oh great, no car.

1:21:54.779 --> 1:21:57.434
[ominous music]

1:22:33.470 --> 1:22:34.862
- Just stay here.

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:38.866
- No.

1:22:40.129 --> 1:22:41.217
I'm coming up.

1:23:12.378 --> 1:23:13.423
Sorry Keeper.

1:23:14.380 --> 1:23:15.207
Sorry.

1:23:44.454 --> 1:23:45.281
The Bible?

1:23:47.979 --> 1:23:48.806
Lily?

1:23:51.896 --> 1:23:55.117
"Thy word is a lamp to my feet.

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:57.032
"The light to my path."

1:23:59.556 --> 1:24:00.383
The light.

1:24:02.254 --> 1:24:03.038
The light!

1:24:06.519 --> 1:24:09.305
[August laughing]

1:24:16.703 --> 1:24:19.054
[phone ringing]
Come on.

1:24:19.097 --> 1:24:19.880
Answer.

1:24:20.968 --> 1:24:21.795
Answer!

1:24:22.970 --> 1:24:24.494
[phone ringing]

1:24:24.537 --> 1:24:27.236
- Keep him as
comfortable as possible.

1:24:27.279 --> 1:24:28.063
This is Amanda.

1:24:28.106 --> 1:24:29.890
- Mandy, August.

1:24:29.934 --> 1:24:30.848
I need your help.

1:24:30.891 --> 1:24:31.979
- I'm a little busy right now.

1:24:32.023 --> 1:24:33.329
I'm with a dying resident.

1:24:33.372 --> 1:24:34.156
- [August] Good.

1:24:34.199 --> 1:24:34.982
- What?

1:24:35.026 --> 1:24:35.809
- He's still alive?

1:24:35.853 --> 1:24:36.897
- [Amanda] Barely.

1:24:36.941 --> 1:24:39.291
- Mandy, please listen to me.

1:24:39.335 --> 1:24:40.597
- I've got to go.

1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.077
- Please, listen!

1:24:43.556 --> 1:24:45.123
- What do you want?

1:24:45.167 --> 1:24:47.169
- I need you to move
Keeper's bed to the window.

1:24:47.212 --> 1:24:48.387
- Are you crazy?

1:24:48.431 --> 1:24:49.258
Any--

1:24:49.301 --> 1:24:50.041
- Please, just do it!

1:24:50.085 --> 1:24:51.216
Please Mandy.

1:24:51.260 --> 1:24:52.478
Now!

1:24:52.522 --> 1:24:54.567
Move Keeper's bed to the window,
please!

1:24:54.611 --> 1:24:55.438
- Fine.

1:24:56.961 --> 1:24:58.397
Help me move his bed
to the window.

1:24:58.441 --> 1:24:59.746
Can you help us?

1:25:18.678 --> 1:25:19.505
- Ah.

1:25:20.376 --> 1:25:21.159
Hello.

1:25:23.335 --> 1:25:24.119
- Hi.

1:25:26.251 --> 1:25:28.732
- All right, the bed is
at the window.

1:25:28.775 --> 1:25:31.169
- Okay, open the curtains.

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:32.692
- What's going on?

1:25:32.736 --> 1:25:34.129
- I have no idea.

1:25:34.172 --> 1:25:37.132
All right, I'm opening
the curtains.

1:25:44.878 --> 1:25:45.879
August, I...

1:25:46.837 --> 1:25:48.969
- Please, Mandy,

1:25:49.013 --> 1:25:50.493
can Keeper see it?

1:25:55.237 --> 1:25:56.063
- Keeper.

1:25:57.935 --> 1:25:59.806
- Come on Dad.

1:25:59.850 --> 1:26:00.677
- Wake up.

1:26:04.637 --> 1:26:05.682
- Please.

1:26:05.725 --> 1:26:06.552
- Keeper.

1:26:08.250 --> 1:26:09.947
I need you to wake up.

1:26:09.990 --> 1:26:10.817
Keeper.

1:26:12.515 --> 1:26:13.342
Wake up.

1:26:14.517 --> 1:26:15.300
- Come on.

1:26:16.693 --> 1:26:17.955
- Keeper, look.

1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.351
Look at the lighthouse.

1:26:22.394 --> 1:26:24.353
Look at what Auggie did.

1:26:26.137 --> 1:26:27.051
- [Keeper] Auggie?

1:26:27.094 --> 1:26:29.488
- Yes Keeper, Auggie.

1:26:29.532 --> 1:26:32.752
- He sees it Auggie, he
sees the light.

1:26:33.971 --> 1:26:35.190
- God is light.

1:26:37.931 --> 1:26:38.758
In Him,

1:26:40.891 --> 1:26:43.198
there is no darkness at all.

1:26:44.547 --> 1:26:45.635
- None at all.

1:26:52.685 --> 1:26:55.384
[Keeper exhales]

1:27:00.215 --> 1:27:03.130
[slow paced music]

1:27:10.573 --> 1:27:11.356
[door knocking]

1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:12.792
- [Male] Come in.

1:27:19.103 --> 1:27:20.409
Welcome.

1:27:20.452 --> 1:27:21.758
- Oh, thank you.

1:27:23.063 --> 1:27:24.848
- August Star I presume?

1:27:24.891 --> 1:27:27.067
- Yeah, August Star senior.

1:27:28.068 --> 1:27:30.332
Not to be confused with my son,

1:27:30.375 --> 1:27:31.898
August Star junior.

1:27:31.942 --> 1:27:35.641
- Believe me, I'll never
confuse you and Auggie.

1:27:35.685 --> 1:27:37.991
How 'bout I call you Keeper?

1:27:39.776 --> 1:27:41.473
- Well, all my friends do.

1:27:41.517 --> 1:27:43.780
- Well then it's appropriate.

1:27:43.823 --> 1:27:45.869
Please, come in, sit down.

1:27:45.912 --> 1:27:49.525
[speaking foreign language]

1:28:01.928 --> 1:28:03.147
Would you like a cup of tea?

1:28:03.190 --> 1:28:06.629
I have an Oolong that's
out of your world.

1:28:07.847 --> 1:28:09.022
That's a joke.

1:28:10.850 --> 1:28:13.592
- No, no tea for me, thank you.

1:28:13.636 --> 1:28:16.203
- Keeper, do you know who I am?

1:28:17.509 --> 1:28:19.250
- You are the Author?

1:28:19.294 --> 1:28:20.120
- I am.

1:28:23.123 --> 1:28:24.037
What is it?

1:28:24.081 --> 1:28:26.910
- Well, it's just that you,

1:28:26.953 --> 1:28:27.780
I mean...

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:30.914
Forgive me.

1:28:31.828 --> 1:28:33.177
- I already have.

1:28:34.396 --> 1:28:35.962
- Right, right.

1:28:36.006 --> 1:28:37.616
It's just you're not--

1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:41.707
- Oh, you were expecting
Charlton Heston?

1:28:41.751 --> 1:28:43.709
I get that all the time.

1:28:44.928 --> 1:28:46.408
August Star senior,

1:28:47.887 --> 1:28:49.367
this is your life.

1:28:53.066 --> 1:28:55.504
Or should I say was your life.

1:28:58.724 --> 1:28:59.986
- Look, I wanna apologize.

1:29:00.030 --> 1:29:00.900
- For what?

1:29:00.944 --> 1:29:03.207
- For this, my life.

1:29:03.250 --> 1:29:06.297
- It's too late for
apologies Keeper.

1:29:08.952 --> 1:29:09.561
Keeper.

1:29:11.171 --> 1:29:14.740
Do you really believe what
you said you believe is true?

1:29:14.784 --> 1:29:15.393
- Yes.

1:29:16.742 --> 1:29:20.267
- Come with me, I wanna
show you something.

1:29:24.184 --> 1:29:25.011
Please.

1:29:28.493 --> 1:29:32.149
- "In the beginning, God created
the Heaven and the Earth."

1:29:32.192 --> 1:29:34.891
- Not a bad opening if I
do say so myself.

1:29:34.934 --> 1:29:37.850
[Keeper chuckling]

1:29:45.945 --> 1:29:47.207
- "For I know the
thoughts that I think

1:29:47.251 --> 1:29:49.166
"toward you sayeth the Lord.

1:29:49.209 --> 1:29:51.473
"Thought of peace and
not of evil."

1:29:51.516 --> 1:29:54.737
- [Author] To give you
an expected end.

1:30:05.661 --> 1:30:08.707
- [Keeper] "Fear thou
not, for I am with thee.

1:30:08.751 --> 1:30:12.624
- [Author] "Be not
dismayed, for I am thy God."

1:30:12.668 --> 1:30:14.234
- [Keeper And Author]
"I will strengthen thee,

1:30:14.278 --> 1:30:15.540
"ye will help thee.

1:30:15.584 --> 1:30:17.499
"Ye I will uphold thee

"with the right hand of my
righteousness."

1:30:28.205 --> 1:30:29.554
- [Keeper] "And we know
that all things

1:30:29.598 --> 1:30:32.601
"work together for good
to them that love God.

1:30:32.644 --> 1:30:34.298
- "To them who are called,

1:30:34.341 --> 1:30:36.561
"according to His purpose."

1:30:40.783 --> 1:30:45.004
Every great story deserves
a hero, don't you agree?

1:30:50.532 --> 1:30:52.577
- "For God so loved the world

1:30:52.621 --> 1:30:55.580
"that He gave His only
begotten son.

1:30:55.624 --> 1:30:58.888
"That whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish,

1:30:58.931 --> 1:31:01.238
"but have everlasting life."

1:31:02.500 --> 1:31:04.502
- Do you believe Keeper?

1:31:04.546 --> 1:31:06.678
- I do, with all my heart.

1:31:08.201 --> 1:31:09.594
- It is finished.

1:31:11.335 --> 1:31:12.989
Welcome home Keeper.

1:31:18.821 --> 1:31:20.387
This is the point
where new arrivals

1:31:20.431 --> 1:31:23.826
usually show a little more
excitement to be here.

1:31:23.869 --> 1:31:26.568
- Yes, I'm very
happy to be here.

1:31:27.525 --> 1:31:28.221
- But.

1:31:29.571 --> 1:31:33.183
- But I lived my entire
life on Owl's Point.

1:31:34.880 --> 1:31:36.186
I should've been out and about

1:31:36.229 --> 1:31:38.841
telling other people this story.

1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:43.019
- Let me show you
something else.

1:31:45.151 --> 1:31:46.805
Keeper, do you know
what these are?

1:31:46.849 --> 1:31:47.632
- Books?

1:31:49.678 --> 1:31:51.506
- Each book is a life.

1:31:52.898 --> 1:31:53.725
- Wow.

1:31:55.379 --> 1:31:56.815
How do you keep 'em
all straight?

1:31:56.859 --> 1:31:57.903
- God only knows.

1:31:59.252 --> 1:32:03.648
Hey, you tossed me the
ball, I had to hit it.

1:32:03.692 --> 1:32:06.433
Anyway Keeper, these
are stories.

1:32:07.304 --> 1:32:08.131
Lives.

1:32:09.393 --> 1:32:11.264
In which you have
been a character

1:32:11.308 --> 1:32:12.831
of great influence.

1:32:16.748 --> 1:32:17.706
- All these?

1:32:17.749 --> 1:32:18.663
- Every one.

1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:24.713
Your story has intersected each
and every life you see here.

1:32:26.018 --> 1:32:29.631
Some of the meetings
you don't even recall.

1:32:29.674 --> 1:32:33.548
Nevertheless, by your
example, a sentence, a deed.

1:32:34.679 --> 1:32:36.768
You helped to write
a new chapter

1:32:36.812 --> 1:32:38.727
in all of these stories.

1:32:39.858 --> 1:32:41.556
You helped to write
events that have

1:32:41.599 --> 1:32:43.906
and continue to bring people

1:32:45.124 --> 1:32:46.996
through that very door.

1:32:49.215 --> 1:32:51.174
Keeper, you have
helped the light

1:32:51.217 --> 1:32:53.132
to pierce the darkness

1:32:53.176 --> 1:32:55.526
and guide many through the storm

1:32:55.570 --> 1:32:58.573
far above your duties
at Owl's Point.

1:32:59.965 --> 1:33:00.792
Well done.

1:33:02.185 --> 1:33:03.795
- What about Auggie?

1:33:05.101 --> 1:33:08.539
- Your sons story is
not yet complete.

1:33:08.583 --> 1:33:11.542
There are many
chapters yet to come.

1:33:16.634 --> 1:33:17.592
I can't tell you the ending,

1:33:17.635 --> 1:33:19.071
that would be a spoiler.

1:33:19.115 --> 1:33:21.117
- I wouldn't mind.

1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:24.120
- Well, what I can tell you

1:33:24.163 --> 1:33:27.863
is that the fire you helped
to kindle in Auggie's life

1:33:27.906 --> 1:33:29.647
will continue to burn.

1:33:31.301 --> 1:33:33.303
Your work is done.

1:33:33.346 --> 1:33:34.652
- That's what worries me.

1:33:34.696 --> 1:33:37.350
[bell ringing]

1:33:37.394 --> 1:33:38.874
- No worries here.

1:33:40.049 --> 1:33:42.617
Auggie is in good hands.

1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:45.620
Now, how would you like
to take a little tour?

1:33:45.663 --> 1:33:47.056
- Sure.

1:33:47.099 --> 1:33:48.448
- [Author] Michael here
will show you the ropes.

1:33:48.492 --> 1:33:49.580
- [Keeper] Mike!

1:33:49.624 --> 1:33:52.017
- Good to see you Keeper.

1:33:52.061 --> 1:33:54.019
- Is he dead too?

1:33:54.063 --> 1:33:55.717
- Well, I, sort of work here.

1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:57.283
Come on, I've got a
lot to show you.

1:33:57.327 --> 1:33:59.068
- This place is full
of surprises.

1:33:59.111 --> 1:34:00.809
- [Mike] You have no idea.

1:34:00.852 --> 1:34:01.897
- Wait, wait.

1:34:03.768 --> 1:34:04.595
Thank you.

1:34:06.075 --> 1:34:08.730
- I'll see you at dinner.

1:34:08.773 --> 1:34:09.600
And

1:34:10.688 --> 1:34:11.994
try the lasagna.

1:34:13.169 --> 1:34:15.388
- Oh, this really is heaven.

1:34:16.476 --> 1:34:19.175
Come on, what are we
waiting for?

1:34:47.116 --> 1:34:48.247
- I sent them.

1:34:53.383 --> 1:34:57.343
An opening night ticket
for each and every city.

1:34:59.215 --> 1:35:01.130
- I always wondered
why there was

1:35:01.173 --> 1:35:04.046
an empty seat third row center.

1:35:04.089 --> 1:35:06.309
- He was very proud
of you August.

1:35:06.352 --> 1:35:07.136
He loved you like a--

1:35:07.179 --> 1:35:08.006
- A son?

1:35:10.748 --> 1:35:13.708
Did you love me like a son too,
Mom?

1:35:26.024 --> 1:35:28.244
- I was 17 and alone.

1:35:28.287 --> 1:35:31.290
I knew you were in good hands.

1:35:31.334 --> 1:35:34.685
After all, he was the 5th
generation of Keepers,

1:35:34.729 --> 1:35:36.339
and he needed a noble heir.

1:35:36.382 --> 1:35:38.036
- I was a disappointment to him.

1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:40.865
- No August, you gave
him purpose.

1:35:42.432 --> 1:35:44.826
The light he cared about
was never this old thing.

1:35:44.869 --> 1:35:45.740
It was you.

1:35:47.480 --> 1:35:48.743
- And the Word.

1:35:49.874 --> 1:35:52.181
I sort of turned that switch off

1:35:52.224 --> 1:35:53.704
after I left here.

1:35:55.227 --> 1:35:57.186
- He thought we might...

1:36:00.537 --> 1:36:03.061
After a lot of
trouble he found me.

1:36:03.105 --> 1:36:06.151
He told me you had gone
off to follow your dream.

1:36:06.195 --> 1:36:07.457
And he thought it might
be a good time

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:09.764
for me to reenter your life.

1:36:09.807 --> 1:36:11.853
I didn't know how.

1:36:11.896 --> 1:36:14.943
But I thought you might
need a manager.

1:36:14.986 --> 1:36:17.728
I sat through 12 of your
performances in four cities

1:36:17.772 --> 1:36:21.166
before I got up the nerve
to pitch to you.

1:36:21.210 --> 1:36:23.865
- At least I know where
I got my acting chops.

1:36:23.908 --> 1:36:26.171
- I can't tell you how many
times I wanted to tell you.

1:36:26.215 --> 1:36:27.172
- The truth?

1:36:28.695 --> 1:36:29.914
Why didn't you?

1:36:33.048 --> 1:36:35.180
- I didn't wanna lose you.

1:36:36.747 --> 1:36:38.053
I figured at least as
your manager

1:36:38.096 --> 1:36:40.664
I could be a part of your life.

1:36:49.716 --> 1:36:50.630
Am I fired?

1:36:56.898 --> 1:36:57.724
- Yes.

1:36:59.248 --> 1:37:00.292
You're fired.

1:37:03.861 --> 1:37:05.602
As my manager,

1:37:05.645 --> 1:37:07.386
but not as my Mother.

1:37:08.997 --> 1:37:13.131
I've let too much come
between me and family.

1:37:13.175 --> 1:37:14.480
But not anymore.

1:37:16.091 --> 1:37:18.745
- Can I have you as a reference?

1:37:32.542 --> 1:37:33.717
I think there's someone else

1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:36.938
that might like to have a
word with you.

1:37:57.088 --> 1:37:59.656
[bell ringing]

1:38:05.401 --> 1:38:07.751
- [August] I know one
thing's for sure.

1:38:07.794 --> 1:38:09.013
- What's that?

1:38:09.057 --> 1:38:11.146
- I will never again
think of Owl's Point

1:38:11.189 --> 1:38:13.670
as a remote, out of the
way, hole in the wall,

1:38:13.713 --> 1:38:16.107
where nothing exciting
ever happens.

1:38:16.151 --> 1:38:17.195
- Told ya so.

1:38:17.239 --> 1:38:18.675
- You did.

1:38:18.718 --> 1:38:19.937
You told me a lot.

1:38:19.981 --> 1:38:21.852
- Sorry, I can be sort
of opinionated.

1:38:21.896 --> 1:38:22.984
- That's a good thing.

1:38:23.027 --> 1:38:24.942
- Not every time.

1:38:24.986 --> 1:38:26.552
- Mandy, thank you.

1:38:29.164 --> 1:38:32.123
You never gave up on Keeper.

1:38:32.167 --> 1:38:32.950
Or me.

1:38:35.170 --> 1:38:36.998
- Well, I've learned that

1:38:38.390 --> 1:38:40.001
just because two people
can't talk to each other

1:38:40.044 --> 1:38:44.222
doesn't mean they can't
still listen to each other.

1:38:46.007 --> 1:38:49.053
Besides, it was good
training for me.

1:38:50.272 --> 1:38:51.142
- Training?

1:38:53.362 --> 1:38:56.017
- I think I'm gonna have
another wanderer on my hands

1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:58.541
in the not too distant future.

1:39:00.673 --> 1:39:05.591
- With your love, she'll
always find her way home.

1:39:05.635 --> 1:39:07.028
- That's my part.

1:39:10.509 --> 1:39:13.121
So, what's next for August Star?

1:39:14.078 --> 1:39:15.123
- About that.

1:39:16.994 --> 1:39:19.040
I've never been so uncertain.

1:39:19.083 --> 1:39:20.911
- I bet for a control
freak that's kind of scary.

1:39:20.955 --> 1:39:21.999
- Real scary.

1:39:25.176 --> 1:39:25.960
- Well,

1:39:29.050 --> 1:39:32.967
I've learned that whenever
I'm the most uncertain,

1:39:33.010 --> 1:39:36.057
the answer is usually
right around the corner.

1:39:36.100 --> 1:39:38.363
- That's what you found?

1:39:38.407 --> 1:39:39.190
- Yeah.

1:39:45.501 --> 1:39:48.373
- Well, I guess I
should get going.

1:39:51.463 --> 1:39:52.290
- I guess.

1:39:54.858 --> 1:39:56.251
- Mandy, could you do me a favor

1:39:56.294 --> 1:39:58.122
and thank Mike for me?

1:39:58.166 --> 1:39:59.471
I know how much he
meant to Keeper.

1:39:59.515 --> 1:40:00.777
- Mike?

1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:04.520
- Mike, Keeper's
caregiver at Owl's Nest.

1:40:04.563 --> 1:40:07.436
- Auggie, we don't have a
Mike on staff.

1:40:07.479 --> 1:40:10.439
But I mean, I can always
check one of the volunteers--

1:40:10.482 --> 1:40:11.483
- Nevermind.

1:40:12.919 --> 1:40:14.878
You know actors, sometimes
we have trouble

1:40:14.921 --> 1:40:17.533
separating fantasy from reality.

1:40:18.708 --> 1:40:20.536
You're real aren't you?

1:40:20.579 --> 1:40:22.016
- Last I checked.

1:40:29.632 --> 1:40:30.459
- Well,

1:40:32.809 --> 1:40:34.811
I guess this is goodbye.

1:40:36.769 --> 1:40:38.597
- Goodbye August Star.

1:40:49.695 --> 1:40:53.177
May your next chapter
be your best chapter.

1:40:53.221 --> 1:40:55.266
- Just around the corner.

1:40:56.789 --> 1:40:59.749
[slow paced music]

1:40:59.792 --> 1:41:00.619
- Auggie.

1:41:03.361 --> 1:41:05.929
I'll keep the light on for you.

1:42:34.539 --> 1:42:35.366
