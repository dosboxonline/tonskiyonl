00:01.626 --> 00:04.254
<i>Look, I don't want to hurt Archer.</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:05.505
-[sighing]
-Oh, thank God.

00:05.588 --> 00:07.132
-<i>But I will.</i>
-[Pam] Goddamn it.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.800
<i>Every hour on the hour.</i>

00:08.883 --> 00:12.011
<i>That's company policy,</i>
<i>and I am a stickler.</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.265
A stickler?
Is that like the one up your ass-ler?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.892
-Didn't quite get there.
-<i>It's simple, really.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.895
<i>Give me the memory stick or Archer dies.</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:22.063
-[all gasp]
-Damn.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.898
I should've saved
the stick thing for that one.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.901
-Look, we want Archer back, but we--
-We'll do it.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But where is Ms. Archer?</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.405
<i>I'd like confirmation from her.</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:34.409
She's distraught, but she deputized me
to make decisions on her behalf.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.245
-Wait, Malory never--
-And one of those decisions is shut up.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.247
<i>And just for a bit of added incentive,</i>

00:39.330 --> 00:42.542
<i>know I'll be beating Archer</i>
<i>until the exchange takes place.</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:43.501
<i>Ta, then.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:44.961
So that's it?

00:45.044 --> 00:48.131
We're really gonna give him
the blueprints to an energy source

00:48.214 --> 00:50.967
that could kill a billion people
if he weaponized it?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.927
And why exactly are you here?

00:53.011 --> 00:56.181
She's here to assess
the environmental impact of that gadget.

00:56.264 --> 00:59.476
So the detonation of a nuclear fusion
weapon, that would be bad?

00:59.559 --> 01:02.395
-Well, yes.
-If only you'd gotten here sooner.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.397
Where in the world is Malory, anyway?

01:04.481 --> 01:07.317
Oh, so we have to reveal
every part of our intricate plan

01:07.400 --> 01:10.195
-so you can blab it everywhere?
-[sighs] We don't know.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.156
Can we please coordinate lies in advance?

01:13.239 --> 01:16.785
I'm flailing out here
like a one-armed milker on meth.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.996
[Fabian] Pardon our dust. Moving in.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.664
Expand or die, you know?

01:21.748 --> 01:24.334
Although the second
is really your only option here.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.878
Hey, I'm handcuffed
and he just threatened to kill me.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.423
Maybe you could,
I don't know, call the police?

01:30.507 --> 01:33.510
I get it. Don't wanna jeopardize
this lucrative job

01:33.593 --> 01:36.054
of picking stuff up
and later putting it back down.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.765
-Check your privilege.
-I'll never do that and you know it.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.892
Welcome to your accommodations.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.728
I trust you'll be comfortable
for four seconds.

01:44.854 --> 01:45.980
Which are over.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.899
That would sound more sinister
if you weren't

01:47.982 --> 01:49.943
standing next to
a giant tub of jelly beans.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.028
It's like if
<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:54.322
were exactly as creepy as it currently is.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.574
Hey, bud. What did the five fingers
say to Archer?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.076
Uh, nice to see you?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.077
[grunts]

01:59.160 --> 02:02.163
No, they didn't say that.
They don't have mouths.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.332
Man, this doesn't seem fair, does it?

02:07.043 --> 02:08.628
[grunting]

02:09.796 --> 02:12.173
Hey, Other Barry, could I talk to Barry?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.425
Sure. You mind if I just
keep laying 'em in here?

02:14.509 --> 02:16.386
-Yes.
-I thought so.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.305
Hey, bud. Barry here.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.683
Fabian tried to hack my central processor

02:21.766 --> 02:23.852
and I guess
he kind of unleashed Other Barry.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.062
And, man, does Other Barry not like you.

02:26.146 --> 02:30.316
I really do consider you
one of my best friends, despite all this.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.530
Yeah, I'd cry if I had access
to my tear ducts right now,

02:35.613 --> 02:37.323
but I got no control, bud.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.201
Other Barry is running the show.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.122
Don't worry. I'll do it for both of us.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.662
-[groans]
-And again,

03:24.746 --> 03:27.540
-I couldn't be sorrier about all this.
-You could try.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.168
-See you in an hour, then.
-Oh, you will.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.211
And I've got everything I need right here.

03:32.295 --> 03:36.382
Also, I'm probably severely concussed,
which is why I'm talking to myself.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.467
Right, Archer?

03:37.550 --> 03:38.885
Right, Other Archer.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.387
No, no, no. Let's not start that shit.

03:41.471 --> 03:45.391
So what is the maximum mass of a star
that will not go supernova?

03:45.475 --> 03:49.103
Uh. Ooh! Estelle Getty!
I got a good feeling about that one.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.649
This is so much better than
watching my ocelot eat endangered birds.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.568
-So how's this going?
-About like you'd expect.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.279
Next question.
Who was your favorite Golden Girl?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.741
-Uh, Chandrasekhar limit.
-That isn't-- Wait a second.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.702
Look, we need to figure out where Archer
is and I don't think this is helping.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.956
Isn't there anything in Singapore that
you picked up, other than gonorrhea?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.833
Ugh, poor people disease.
I'm strictly spirochetes.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.836
Wait. Colt, didn't we find,
like, a thing in your old apartment?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.588
Oh, yeah. I meant to analyze this.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.883
But you were too busy
exploring the golden age of television?

04:18.967 --> 04:22.095
Oh, so I'm supposed to keep track
of everything I'm supposed to be doing?

04:22.178 --> 04:24.222
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

04:24.305 --> 04:28.142
[sighs] If I apply power, I should be able
to get a handle on what it does.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.560
-[electronic screeching]
-[all groaning]

04:29.644 --> 04:32.105
Jesus. Did we just contact the monolith?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.274
That was a radio signal!
I'll try to trace it.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.444
It's a backdoor into the IIA mainframe.
I think I built the mainframe.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.779
[all gasp]

04:39.862 --> 04:43.241
Hey, guys, I think it's possible
I wasn't a very good person.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.868
Well, what's important
is that you're a good guy now.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.121
And all it took was
destroying 8% of your brain.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.206
[chuckles] Thank you. Wait, what?

04:50.290 --> 04:55.044
Oh, did I not tell you that? Yeah,
it's like, zip, gone. Totally destroyed.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.506
Well, lookee here.
You running, squirrel meat?

04:58.589 --> 05:03.136
No, just heading to lunch
with all the stuff I ever brought here.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.929
[sighs] Fine, I was leaving.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.682
Since we're about to be
responsible for the apocalypse,

05:07.765 --> 05:10.268
if I leave now, maybe I won't
end up in a bone cage

05:10.351 --> 05:12.562
where I'm slowly revenge-eaten by mutants.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.731
Okay, weirdo. That's why I'm staying.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.524
[scoffs] No, Ray, we need you.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.444
-You were an employee of IIA.
-I'm temp to perm!

05:19.527 --> 05:22.196
This is just HR talking here,
but I know that that would give you

05:22.280 --> 05:25.408
limited access to their system and
a general sense of how it's structured.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.702
Dukes. Damn your HR acumen.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.537
[sighs] So what's the plan here?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.789
-We go get Archer.
-That's the plan?

05:31.873 --> 05:35.293
Yeah. I mean, a frontal assault
on an IIA compound?

05:35.376 --> 05:37.211
I don't know. They seem pretty good.

05:37.295 --> 05:40.465
I mean, sure, we're gonna kick
their asses, but, like, are we?

05:40.548 --> 05:42.842
So, what? A sternly worded letter?

05:42.925 --> 05:46.345
I got my pen, and it's mightier
than a sword full of word poison.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.807
Look at you, about to roll over
to these boring overlords.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.476
Where's your self-respect?

05:51.559 --> 05:54.145
You used to be the best
in the world at this!

05:54.228 --> 05:57.815
-Jesus, neck bones is right.
-Goddamn it, I am in.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.277
-Let's do this.
-Wait, you guys, I was being sarcastic.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.821
You all suck and you always have.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.242
Note to self: work on voice tone.
Invisible tape recorder off. Boop.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.580
Oh, come on.
We're playing hide and seek now?

06:12.663 --> 06:15.708
Red rover, red rover, let Archer--

06:15.792 --> 06:17.752
Shit, wait, that's the wrong game.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.130
[shouts]

06:22.924 --> 06:24.509
So, this was the plan, bud?

06:25.301 --> 06:27.678
The coffee pot
was to breach your exterior,

06:27.762 --> 06:30.681
the staples were to, uh, jam your gears.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.851
Jam my gears?
I have frictionless bearings.

06:33.935 --> 06:37.855
I'm a wonder of modern technology,
not a freaking cuckoo clock.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.398
-Come on.
-Okay, I get it.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.567
Think I'd go through
the trouble of making myself

06:41.651 --> 06:44.821
a death robot whose only weakness
is office supplies?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.656
Fine. You don't have to
be a dick about it.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.200
I wanted to make a blender glove,
but that stuff wasn't here.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.161
-Then I got distracted by the jelly beans.
-Blender glove.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.747
All right.
That might have been cool. Okay.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.833
Uh, Barry, are you in there?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.585
-Hey, bud.
-Can you talk to Other Barry, here?

06:59.669 --> 07:03.256
Uh, sure thing. Hey, Other Barry,
uh, why do you wanna do this?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.883
I have a really great answer to that,
and it's "shut up."

07:05.967 --> 07:09.011
Classic avoidance. Afraid of what
you might find, Other Barry?

07:09.679 --> 07:14.475
You had sex with my fiancée
and dropped me from a building. Twice.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.352
Which made me into this.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.604
A mechanical demigod? Come on, man.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.023
We experience sex in eight dimensions now.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.318
Wow, you do?
Maybe you should drop me off a building.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.528
Oh, I'm planning on it.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.031
Would you stop throwing boxes?
It's really annoying.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.702
Other Barry, you're not a person.
You're the rage I felt at Archer.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.870
I pushed you deep down

07:33.953 --> 07:35.955
-into my metaprogramming.
-Wait, really?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.832
You're the part of me
I tried to get rid of.

07:37.915 --> 07:41.043
Well, I'm still here. Okay, Archer?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.880
Barry, heal thyself.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.339
Seriously, shut up.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.008
Archer!

07:47.091 --> 07:50.261
♪ <i>Ring around the rosies</i> ♪

07:50.344 --> 07:52.680
That-- Damn it, that's not it either.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.848
Archer, he's coming.

07:53.931 --> 07:57.226
You probably know that,
but honestly it feels weird and helpless

07:57.310 --> 08:01.022
to ride around on a psychopath,
so I'm just saying stuff to feel alive.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.816
You again? I was about to get away.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.651
Uh, I think he had you.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.404
Uh, might wanna try behind him.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.866
-[chuckles] Man, I like this guy.
-Oh, come on.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.620
What kind of world would it be if every
person I insulted made my life worse?

08:15.703 --> 08:17.538
I don't know, a better one?

08:18.789 --> 08:21.125
And that's lunch.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.127
See you in an hour, champ.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.213
Great, now I landed on my keys.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.965
Wait, I don't have keys on me. How did I--

08:28.049 --> 08:31.802
That mover slipped it into my pocket.
I take back everything I said about you.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.515
Well, I take back 60% of what I said.
No need to overreact.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.432
[sighs]

08:36.516 --> 08:39.936
[voice breaking] We'll do the exchange.
Just don't hurt him anymore.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.771
-[line disconnects]
-[normal voice] Remember,

08:41.854 --> 08:43.981
-this is a nonlethal mission.
-Wait, for real?

08:44.065 --> 08:47.193
I want them alive to relive the pain
we're about to inflict on them

08:47.276 --> 08:49.487
over and over again.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.989
There's my girl.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.411
[typing]

08:59.664 --> 09:01.165
And we're go.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.417
Nice. Extensive bathroom coverage.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.670
Just two peas in a pervert pod.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.713
-Hey, I'm working on one of those.
-Okay.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.342
We can all agree I look banging in this,
but how are we gonna get in this place?

09:11.425 --> 09:13.427
They've got at least two guards
at every entrance.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.429
Right, but now that we're in their system,

09:15.513 --> 09:18.808
I'll just leave a couple negative
performance reviews and--

09:18.891 --> 09:21.352
I appreciate the creativity,
but won't that take--

09:21.435 --> 09:23.688
Suspended. Trust me.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.607
This place is more uptight
than a preacher's wife at an orgy.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.442
And you liked working there?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.820
-They had great snacks!
-At the orgy?

09:30.903 --> 09:33.739
See? That right there makes me wonder
why I'm taking her inside.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.158
Hey, I have extensive training in--

09:36.242 --> 09:38.911
Not anything. So wait, same question.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.330
You need to go in there and sow chaos.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.250
I want that place looking like
an escaped tiger hit Mardi Gras.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.085
Everything has led me to this.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.170
Uh, where were you carrying that?

09:48.254 --> 09:50.464
-Cyril and I are gonna go get Archer.
-Here you go.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.634
These should get you through the building.
And if they don't, my bad.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.803
Has anybody heard from Ms. Archer at all?

09:55.886 --> 09:57.763
Seems like she'd wanna be a part of this.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.807
Hey, yeah. Where is Ms. Archer?

09:59.890 --> 10:01.767
No. Nothing. No way.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.313
I mean, it's just weird how not at all
I've heard from her.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.440
Something you'd like
to share with the class, Pam?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.524
Uh, no.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.944
There's not a secret you want tell
'cause it's so secret?

10:12.028 --> 10:14.155
[stammering] I… Mmm. Fine!

10:14.238 --> 10:15.740
Fine! I'll tell you.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.242
I've been thinking about getting bangs.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.036
[fake sobs]

10:20.119 --> 10:22.622
It feels so good to let it out.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.833
-Nice cover.
-Whew, that was close, huh?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.801
[Cyril] Oh, come on.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.990
[elevator bell dings]

10:59.408 --> 11:01.327
-Hey, hold up.
-[phone chimes]

11:01.410 --> 11:05.039
I'm fired? Oh, my God,
what am I gonna tell my wife?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.832
Susan's gonna leave me.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.170
-Damn it, Archer.
-Hey, gang.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.051
[chuckles] Yeah, it still works like that.
Thanks for checking, though.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.976
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hey.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.814
So I managed to escape right when you guys
were running a rescue mission

11:29.897 --> 11:32.191
and now everyone is inside
with a schizo death cyborg?

11:32.274 --> 11:35.111
-Uh, yes?
-How is your timing so bad?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.862
-One could argue that your--
-Shut up.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.073
Give me a Tactile Cane
and everything else in the van.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.157
Everything?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.118
Who knows what we'll need
to take down Barry?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.203
Mind-meld helmet,
the shock paddles, everything.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.871
You mean, like, everything-everything?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.666
We don't need the stuff you use
to, like, circle jerk with ghosts.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.751
Well, to be fair, that stuff is mine.

11:50.835 --> 11:55.339
If they're sticky,
that's ectoplasm and nothing else.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.344
-We've gotta get out of here.
-No, we need to find Archer first.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.848
[Colt] <i>Hey, just for, like, your FYI,</i>
<i>Archer actually made it out on his own.</i>

12:03.931 --> 12:06.684
[Krieger] <i>Don't worry, he's on his way</i>
<i>back in to get you guys out.</i>

12:06.767 --> 12:08.853
What? So the same thing can happen again?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.187
[Colt] <i>Yeesh. I hope not.</i>

12:10.271 --> 12:12.523
[laughs] <i>That would suck.</i>

12:12.606 --> 12:14.859
<i>Especially 'cause the building's on fire.</i>

12:15.734 --> 12:17.653
[cackling]

12:18.571 --> 12:20.573
-[shouting]
-What the hell?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.705
Did you drug all those people?

12:27.788 --> 12:31.083
No. I just put angel dust
in one of the watercoolers.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.586
They drank that water
out of their own free choicing.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.004
Not what "free choice" means.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.214
[Barry shouts]

12:37.298 --> 12:39.925
Okay. Maybe more running?

12:40.009 --> 12:43.012
I suppose I'm looking
for a reason my guards are leaving,

12:43.095 --> 12:46.390
and the rest of my employees
are stark raving bonkers.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.519
Well, I'd like to state for the record
that you are not a golden being of light,

12:50.603 --> 12:52.897
-but are, in fact--
-[gun cocks]

12:52.980 --> 12:54.190
fired.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.943
So are you here to find Archer,
or shoot me?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.279
Because I actually have
a preference on that.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.614
Both.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.282
-Freeze!
-Don't move.

13:03.365 --> 13:07.286
I was this close to feeling regret.
Would've been a first for me.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.872
Incidentally,
why are you dressed like that?

13:09.955 --> 13:11.624
Isn't it obvious?

13:11.707 --> 13:13.542
[coughing]

13:13.626 --> 13:15.503
[grunting]

13:21.425 --> 13:23.844
Guess the old gal's still got it.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.557
Damn it. You weren't supposed
to set fire to the whole building.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.142
No one said that!

13:30.226 --> 13:31.769
At least it's sexier now.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.439
[humming]

13:36.774 --> 13:38.359
That's not a song.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.279
Come on, guys. You can beat him.
Use what's around you.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.533
Will you shut up?
Archer already tried that, and it was--

13:45.616 --> 13:46.742
Ah!

13:46.825 --> 13:48.536
These are delicate optical sensors.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.788
Do you have any idea how much these cost?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.790
-[Pam] More than your head?
-Do what now?

13:55.167 --> 13:58.754
Now, I go into your mind and take you
apart from the inside. Hit it, Krieger!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.646
Yeah. My skull is shielded.

14:15.729 --> 14:19.108
But I have to know,
what exactly did you think would happen?

14:19.191 --> 14:21.235
I thought I'd maybe go inside your mind

14:21.318 --> 14:23.696
and there'd be a Barry
and a separate Other Barry.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.990
-And?
-And Other Barry would be

14:26.073 --> 14:28.742
some kind of Gigeresque monstrosity,
and then Barry and I

14:28.826 --> 14:31.370
would defeat Other Barry
in some kind of metaphorical combat

14:31.453 --> 14:33.414
which would forever
extinguish Other Barry.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.958
-And?
-Barry and I would be friends again.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.627
[laughs]

14:38.711 --> 14:40.296
God, what happened to you?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.464
I'll tell you what happened. Friendship.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.133
Whatever.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.304
Now that's what I call-- [grunts]

14:48.387 --> 14:51.056
-Mother?
-Well, don't just stand there, idiots.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.433
Do something!

14:56.103 --> 14:57.021
[shrieks]

15:00.691 --> 15:03.277
Archer, I can do a hard reboot
from inside here,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.946
-but you have to stun me.
-[shouts]

15:08.699 --> 15:10.284
-Just do it.
-But you'll die.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.952
Nothing can change that now.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.707
[shouts]

15:19.460 --> 15:21.378
Now-- Now, Krieger.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.717
[grunts, splutters]

15:26.800 --> 15:28.218
[coughing]

15:28.302 --> 15:31.555
Thanks, bud. Hard reboot now.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.559
-You saved my life, Barry.
-No, you saved mine.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.644
Um, how?

15:36.727 --> 15:39.146
I don't know. Just felt right to say.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.898
Good night,

15:40.981 --> 15:43.817
sweet me.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.736
No!

15:45.819 --> 15:47.988
Wait, that shock brought some things back.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.700
I built the IIA system and I know
how to take down the entire company.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.619
-All we gotta do is--
-[gunshot]

15:54.328 --> 15:55.162
[whimpers]

15:55.245 --> 15:58.165
You betrayed me.
You were like a brother to me.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.334
I-- I was? [grunts]

16:00.417 --> 16:02.753
Oh, that's unsatisfying.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.425
You guys get out. I'll take Fabian.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.177
Just make sure Mother is safe.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.263
Oh, I guess she already left
at some point. Right.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.602
-Gotta hang on, man.
-No, this is it. Just promise me.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.853
Anything. What?

16:19.937 --> 16:23.482
Do more science.
Just really weird, fucked-up shit.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.777
Stuff where even you're like,
"Man, I shouldn't have done that."

16:26.860 --> 16:28.112
Do that.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.697
[sobbing] I will.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.324
[whispers] Thank you for being a friend.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.119
-[exhales]
-[sobbing]

16:35.202 --> 16:39.331
Um, hate to interrupt,
but let's get out of here.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.837
-[gunshot]
-Not getting away that easy.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.006
You know, that cane is appropriate.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.091
You're old. Your time has passed.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.969
The modern world has no use
for your little spy boutique.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.263
You might as well be selling buggy whips.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.265
Yeah? Maybe I should sell teeth instead.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.434
Why would you sell-- Ooh! [spits]

16:58.517 --> 17:00.811
-And we have a buyer.
-Right.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.482
[grunts]

17:10.821 --> 17:12.990
Now, let's try that again.

17:13.907 --> 17:14.908
[shouts]

17:19.329 --> 17:23.083
The almighty Archer,
barely a shadow of your former self.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.961
-You know, I should thank you.
-This ought to be good.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.463
I hate you so much,

17:27.546 --> 17:30.507
I think I just realized
I don't need my cane anymore.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.513
[creaking, rumbling]

17:38.265 --> 17:39.349
[shouts]

17:40.392 --> 17:41.685
[groaning]

17:41.769 --> 17:43.437
God, I hate this hallway.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.525
Thanks for creating
an escape route for me.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.860
I guess you have a choice:

17:49.943 --> 17:53.072
try to come after me,
or drag your friend out of here.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.156
Ta-ta.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.954
[groans]

18:01.038 --> 18:03.457
-You again?
-So it would appear.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.294
Why did you help me
even after I insulted you?

18:07.377 --> 18:09.046
Why else are we here?

18:09.129 --> 18:11.131
Wow. I need to hang out with more movers.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.428
[sighs] Robert?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.764
How did it go? I'm on tenterhooks here.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.433
Well, we got Archer back
and burned down a building.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.603
-Ah, good. And the memory stick?
-We'll figure it out in the morning.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.855
-We were too tired to deal with it.
-[shower running]

18:26.939 --> 18:29.316
You know, I find it odd
that an environmentalist

18:29.399 --> 18:31.527
would have the shower going
while he's in bed.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.446
And also-- Okay, you are naked.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.240
Lana, I know what it looks like,

18:36.323 --> 18:38.826
and that's exactly what it is.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.203
-I understand it's awkward.
-Awkward?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.205
That word seems to trigger you.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.708
Was I wrong in assuming we had evolved
into a de facto open marriage?

18:46.792 --> 18:49.211
Why would you assume that?

18:49.294 --> 18:52.965
-Wait, did you talk to Archer?
-Yes. We had a conversation.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.551
That chatty, soon-to-be-dead man.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.595
Look, what happened in Japan
is not even close to this.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.639
Wait, what happened in Japan?

19:00.722 --> 19:04.434
It was-- Uh, is that not
what we're talking about?

19:04.518 --> 19:07.604
I was talking with him when
you got that bartender's phone number.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.024
It was a receipt. And that was enough
for you to cheat on me?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.986
-And what about Japan?
-You didn't even know about that.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.488
This is about you being
so jealous over a phone number--

19:16.572 --> 19:17.573
I mean, a receipt!

19:17.656 --> 19:20.659
So you thought
it was a phone number? I knew it!

19:20.742 --> 19:23.453
I almost died today, okay? Like, a lot.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.915
Well, we didn't know that
because you cut us out of the whole thing.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.750
Wait a minute, who's "us"?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.086
Ugh, I got tired
of waiting in the bathroom.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.921
Yep. I'm out.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.220
Stupid bouncer.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.600
Maybe you have unprocessed trauma
that you're expressing as hostility.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.561
And, by the way,
when did bouncers get so insightful?

19:47.644 --> 19:48.645
-[woman crying]
-Huh?

19:50.814 --> 19:51.732
[sniffles]

20:05.495 --> 20:08.040
-Should we wait for Mother, Pam?
-Don't look at me.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.167
She just told me to coordinate
the rescue with her.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.669
She didn't wanna tell you guys
because she thought you'd blab

20:12.753 --> 20:14.129
and blow her element of surprise.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
And she told you?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.591
A woman whose loose lips
have sunk so many ships

20:17.674 --> 20:21.053
they should be named "Admiral Nelson"
and "concept of torpedoes"?

20:21.136 --> 20:24.473
Well, pardon me for experiencing
emotional growth, you dick.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.058
I guess we start without her.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.353
So, now that we're all rested,
ideas for the memory stick?

20:30.562 --> 20:33.649
Really? Nothing? So we slept on it
for no discernible reason?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.859
[Robert] Well, not no discernible reason.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.444
I think you can all relax.

20:37.527 --> 20:40.447
I don't think another infusion of cash
is going to make a difference.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.784
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm done burning money.

20:43.867 --> 20:48.163
I sold the agency to a well-funded
equity group, United Money Partners.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.457
You could destroy the chip
and stay afloat.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.542
United Money Partners, LLC.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.754
Looks like that's owned
by a General Business, Inc.,

20:55.837 --> 20:58.632
which is actually a shell company
owned by YYZ.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.716
Zed.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.719
Which is in turn owned
by a majority stakeholder named--

21:02.803 --> 21:04.721
[Fabian] Fabian Kingsworth.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.266
I was just so impressed
with your initiative,

21:07.349 --> 21:09.268
grit and improvisation last night,

21:09.351 --> 21:11.728
I knew that IIA had to acquire you.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.397
-Yes!
-Really?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.023
They have great snacks.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.235
Archer, I hate to use the term "fun fact,"

21:18.318 --> 21:20.779
but did you know that
as part of a tax dodge,

21:20.862 --> 21:24.658
your apartment and everything in it
is property of the agency

21:24.741 --> 21:26.034
and therefore mine?

21:26.118 --> 21:28.870
And so is that memory stick.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.706
-Not so fast.
-What now?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.582
Yeah. Curious where
you're going with this.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.711
There's one thing
you fail to understand, Fabian,

21:35.794 --> 21:39.715
and when I reveal it, you will realize
that you have been taken for a fool.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.216
And what's that, Archer?

21:47.097 --> 21:50.392
So, what kinda snacks we talking about?

22:03.947 --> 22:07.367
-Hey. I don't think you wanna do that.
-No, let him.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.786
Give me that.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.789
"My dearest Sterling,
do you remember what I told you

22:12.873 --> 22:14.291
on your first day of training?

22:14.374 --> 22:17.711
You probably don't, but it was,
'Always know where the exits are.'

22:17.794 --> 22:19.880
And with all the chaos
and confusion of late,

22:19.963 --> 22:22.424
I thought it would be wise
to make my own exit

22:22.507 --> 22:25.469
in my own time,
on my own terms and in a way

22:25.552 --> 22:27.596
that I can never be found by my enemies

22:27.679 --> 22:31.349
or all my lovesick paramours,
who are literally countless."

22:31.433 --> 22:32.434
Ugh.

22:32.517 --> 22:36.104
"And so I've decided
that it's time to pass the torch.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.857
-Try not to burn yourselves with it."
-[torch ignites]

22:39.483 --> 22:41.443
What? It relaxes me.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.196
"And I know my decision may seem abrupt,

22:44.279 --> 22:47.491
but we don't always get
to choose the perfect moment.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.034
Take care of yourselves,

22:49.117 --> 22:50.786
<i>especially you, my Sterling,</i>

22:50.869 --> 22:54.706
<i>because from wherever I am,</i>
<i>I'll be watching over you.</i>

22:54.790 --> 22:57.084
<i>Love, Mother."</i>

22:57.167 --> 23:01.588
[Malory] If I see this glass empty again,
I will be very unhappy.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.758
And how is my lady love?

23:04.841 --> 23:07.010
Infinitely better now.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.105
[waves lapping gently]
