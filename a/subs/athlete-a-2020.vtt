00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
[woman 1] Tight knees, tight knees.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.209
Head in, Abbie.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.755
[woman 2] When I was young,
my dream was always to go to the Olympics.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.840
And so I always had that
in the back of my head.

00:48.923 --> 00:52.260
[woman 1] Guys, the goal is no arm circles
on any of your sticks.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.888
Only count the ones
that are stuck cold, okay?

00:56.723 --> 00:58.391
[woman 2] I just love gymnastics.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.894
I love the drive that it gives me.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.610
[woman 1] Carly, try not to stagger.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.488
[woman 2] It teaches you
to be strong, independent.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.329
-[woman 3] Yep. Sorry.
-[woman 4] It's okay.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.874
[woman 2] Being able to fly through
the air and do the things we do,

01:22.957 --> 01:26.211
it's just so thrilling, and you get
that adrenaline rush and...

01:26.294 --> 01:27.629
You can't even explain it.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.972
[girls] Maggie!
Come on, Maggie! Go, Maggie!

01:38.056 --> 01:39.516
[cheering]

01:40.934 --> 01:41.810
[boy] Yeah!

01:41.893 --> 01:42.894
[applause]

01:42.977 --> 01:45.146
[Maggie] I started gymnastics
when I was three years old

01:45.230 --> 01:47.273
because I was always
climbing out of my crib

01:47.357 --> 01:49.901
and climbing on the furniture
and everything, so...

01:49.984 --> 01:52.821
my parents put me in it,
just be in a safer environment

01:53.238 --> 01:55.782
where there's mats and coaches
and stuff like that.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.158
[shouts]

01:57.242 --> 02:00.286
[woman 5] I liked the sport.
I mean, I did it in high school.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.914
I always watched it on TV, and I loved it.

02:03.748 --> 02:07.544
And so I had this little girl,
after three sons, and I put her in it.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.504
So, yes, as a preschooler.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.505
[applause]

02:10.588 --> 02:13.091
Right away, the coaches picked up on her.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.094
They nabbed her up as a little girl,
like in second grade.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.807
I mean, she was the only ten-year-old
in the country that competed at Nationals.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.770
[man] You know, somebody drove her
to the gym, maybe 45 minutes from here.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.772
Come back, maybe go back to work,

02:27.856 --> 02:29.941
pick up Maggie at the gym.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.153
That was every day
for years and years and years.

02:34.070 --> 02:39.409
[woman] Here's Maggie Nichols,
Level 10 junior from Twin City Twisters.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.120
[Maggie] The goal was to try
to be an elite gymnast

02:42.203 --> 02:43.788
and to make the national team.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.833
Did online school as well,
so I could train more in the gym.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.627
And this is probably
one of my favorite leos. Um...

02:50.044 --> 02:51.254
I love the white.

02:51.337 --> 02:55.425
Like, I don't know what it is, but if it
has white on it, I just-- I just love it.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.885
I don't know why. [laughs]

03:01.472 --> 03:04.350
If you wanted to take the next step
to make national team,

03:04.434 --> 03:07.270
you need to be very strong,
because gymnastics would be like...

03:07.520 --> 03:10.481
you know, almost your whole life.
I mean, it was almost my whole life.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.692
You give up almost everything.

03:13.610 --> 03:17.864
[man 1 over PA]<i> Now on balance beam</i>

03:30.501 --> 03:32.503
[ethereal music playing]

03:47.227 --> 03:51.356
[Gina] USA Gymnastics took
Maggie's Olympic dream away from her.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.071
It was just so hurtful and so painful.
Everything that happened.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.452
[John] We have fairly good ideas on...

04:05.286 --> 04:06.829
what actually happened.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.748
Evidence, I would say.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.587
[man] So you're watching justice
happen in slow motion?

04:14.671 --> 04:16.673
Well, hopefully justice. [laughs]

04:16.756 --> 04:18.007
Hopefully justice.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.489
[man] When we started reporting
on the initial story,

04:42.115 --> 04:45.076
this was really the most explosive story

04:45.159 --> 04:49.289
that the USA Today Network
has had in several years.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.709
Yet it was coming out of the sticks,
you know?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.461
[laughs] It was coming out
of a small little newsroom.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.922
Okay, what do we got?

04:59.924 --> 05:03.761
Um, one of our sources
who runs the popular blog--

05:03.845 --> 05:08.308
[man] Like everyone,
I'd watch gymnastics during the Olympics,

05:08.391 --> 05:12.937
and I had witnessed some of the stars,
you know, over the years.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.775
USA Gymnastics was an organization
in this town,

05:17.859 --> 05:22.071
but I really didn't know a lot about
what was going on behind the scenes.

05:22.155 --> 05:27.452
So, you know, what that culture was like
was new to me and, uh...

05:27.952 --> 05:30.121
and we sort of were plunged into it.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.923

06:31.432 --> 06:35.395

<i>It alleges the organization has a policy</i>

06:41.818 --> 06:43.736
I had been working on an investigation

06:43.820 --> 06:46.239
into failure to report sexual abuse
in schools.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.991
We'd had a number of local cases
in Indiana.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.411
And so, as I was looking
at a broader piece on,

06:51.494 --> 06:53.371
why does this seem to keep happening?

06:53.454 --> 06:57.458
Why do people not report
as they're required to do?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.378
A source suggested
that I look at USA Gymnastics

07:00.461 --> 07:02.839
and how they handle
sexual abuse allegations.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.009
And that source pointed me
toward a lawsuit

07:07.093 --> 07:09.679
involving a predatory coach...

07:10.346 --> 07:12.974
who had moved from gym to gym to gym,

07:13.057 --> 07:15.143
despite warning signs about his conduct.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.645
You'll have to edit it just a bit.

07:18.396 --> 07:23.484
[man] One coach was shown
to have abused a young gymnast

07:23.568 --> 07:29.824
after USA Gymnastics
had been warned about him years earlier.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.370
In the file, one complaint said,

07:34.454 --> 07:38.833
"This coach needs to be put in a cage
before he rapes somebody."

07:40.042 --> 07:42.295
Uh, USA Gymnastics did nothing.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.715
[indistinct chattering]

07:45.798 --> 07:48.176
[Kwiatkowski] As we were pursuing
this investigation,

07:48.259 --> 07:50.678
we got access to these depositions

07:50.761 --> 07:54.140
with current and former
high-ranking USA Gymnastics officials

07:54.223 --> 07:57.143
that described their policy
for how they handled these allegations.

07:58.561 --> 08:02.482
[man] Mr. Penny, uh, you are the president
currently of USA Gymnastics?

08:02.565 --> 08:03.399
[Penny] Yes.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.236
[man] If you receive a complaint
of sexual misconduct,

08:07.320 --> 08:12.533
whether it be by a professional member
or anyone that has a membership with USAG,

08:12.617 --> 08:14.827
do you turn it over to local authorities?

08:15.661 --> 08:16.496
No.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.496
[man] Okay.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.583
We don't turn over a complaint.

08:32.803 --> 08:36.057
[Kwiatkowski] For the first time,
it showed USA Gymnastics had a policy

08:36.140 --> 08:38.893
of not reporting all allegations
to authorities.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.520
That they would dismiss allegations
as hearsay

08:41.604 --> 08:44.690
unless they were signed by a victim,
a victim's parent,

08:44.774 --> 08:46.609
or an eyewitness to the abuse.

08:50.821 --> 08:56.035
[Berta] And we found USA Gymnastics
had sexual abuse complaint files

08:56.118 --> 08:58.120
on 54 coaches.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.999
And if there was no signed statement

09:02.083 --> 09:06.545
by the victim or the victim's parent,
they just tucked it in a folder

09:06.629 --> 09:09.674
and stuffed it
in Steve Penny's filing cabinet.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.928
And then those coaches
went on to molest other children.

<i>and USA Today Network</i> <i>dominated this day.</i>

10:11.027 --> 10:14.196
[woman 2] The paper is reporting that,
on multiple occasions,

10:14.280 --> 10:18.784
USA Gymnastics compiled complaints
of coaches accused of sexual misconduct

10:18.868 --> 10:21.746
but refused to share the information
with police,

10:21.829 --> 10:24.040
most often dismissing it as hearsay,

10:24.123 --> 10:26.375
because the complaints
were not made by the victims,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.419
those young athletes, or their parents.

10:28.502 --> 10:32.632
[woman 1] <i>In a statement, Steve Penny,</i>
<i>the president of USA Gymnastics,</i>

10:32.715 --> 10:37.345

10:49.106 --> 10:50.816
[woman] I was cleaning my kitchen,

10:50.900 --> 10:53.736
and I had two babies
that were 13 months apart.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.363
And they were both fussy,

10:55.446 --> 10:57.907
and so I had my baby strapped to me.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.825
I was wearing her
while I cleaned the kitchen.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.412
And I needed to make a shopping list,
so I opened my computer

11:03.496 --> 11:04.705
and Facebook was up,

11:04.789 --> 11:08.501
and trending in the news section was
the headline for the <i>IndyStar </i>article.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.836
It was a complete accident
that I even saw it.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.381
But I clicked on it,
and I read it right away.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.716
And the first thought was, "I was right.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.886
They've been burying sexual abuse.
I was right.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.304
And this is it.

11:20.805 --> 11:21.639
Now's the time.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.101
If it's ever going to come out,
it's going to come out now."

11:29.480 --> 11:31.982
[indistinct chattering]

11:33.150 --> 11:37.154
[Alesia] On the morning of publication
of that first story...

11:37.655 --> 11:41.492
we got an e-mail
from Rachael Denhollander.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.248
And she wrote,
"My abuse wasn't by a coach,

11:47.331 --> 11:50.000
but it was by a famous doctor.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.545
And if they're covering things up
for the coaches,

11:52.628 --> 11:55.339
I think they would be
covering it up for him."

11:55.423 --> 11:57.883
And that was the first time

11:57.967 --> 12:02.179
I had heard there could be something wrong
with Larry Nassar.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.838
story came out in 2016...

12:36.505 --> 12:38.883
Nassar just came back into my head.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.844
When something hits you like...

12:43.053 --> 12:45.514
that realization
that it was sexual abuse...

12:46.140 --> 12:49.185
and you haven't known,
haven't thought about it...

12:50.603 --> 12:51.771
it becomes...

12:53.481 --> 12:54.565
so real.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.400
Like it was yesterday.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.153
Like it just happened to you.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.203
[Dantzscher] My head started
kind of like spinning a little bit.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.873
I've never told anybody, but...

13:11.624 --> 13:13.083
I was like, "Wait a minute...

13:14.418 --> 13:18.756
this doctor used to do
very similar things to me."

13:21.091 --> 13:22.468
At that point, I was...

13:23.010 --> 13:24.470
still scared, but...

13:24.970 --> 13:28.265
I was thinking, "If he is a pedophile...

13:29.016 --> 13:29.975
and I...

13:30.726 --> 13:34.146
don't do something about it,
I can't live with that."

13:36.148 --> 13:39.443
[man] I was approached
by Jamie Dantzscher,

13:39.527 --> 13:41.028
who was a 2000 Olympian.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.113
And she told me

13:43.197 --> 13:44.865
the story about this. Dr. Nassar,

13:44.949 --> 13:47.618
and she felt like
he had sexually assaulted her.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.161
I believed her.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.916
After I agreed to take her case,
I called <i>The Indianapolis Star.</i>

13:53.999 --> 13:55.584
And I said, "Great article.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.671
By the way, have you ever heard of a guy
named Larry Nassar?"

13:59.880 --> 14:01.882
I... I was stunned.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.719
I mean, I just thought, "Now this is--
Now we're talking three people."

14:06.220 --> 14:08.264
And these women didn't know each other.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.266
How many more could there be?

14:22.361 --> 14:23.779
[man 1]<i> Oh, golly.</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:26.615
-[woman]<i> Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</i>
-[man 1]<i> Oh, God.</i>

14:26.949 --> 14:29.159
-[woman]<i> Oh, no.</i>
-Medical?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.494
[sobbing]

14:30.578 --> 14:32.621
Shh-shh-shh.<i> </i>Easy. easy, easy, easy.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.208
[man 2]<i> You can obviously see</i>
<i>the shaking of the head, the resignation.</i>

14:36.292 --> 14:39.420
<i>Everybody knows this goes</i>
<i>with the territory, and they hate it.</i>

14:40.254 --> 14:44.842
[man 1]<i> Medical staff.</i>
<i>Dr. Larry Nassar on the floor.</i>

14:44.925 --> 14:46.594
<i>He keeps these women together.</i>

14:46.677 --> 14:48.304
[indistinct chatter over PA]

14:54.727 --> 14:56.896
[Kwiatkowski] Larry Nassar
had been the team doctor

14:56.979 --> 15:00.149
for USA Gymnastics' women's program
for 29 years.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.819
He was also a Michigan State University
doctor at the time.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.822
So he was this prominent member
of the community...

15:07.406 --> 15:09.408
when we got these allegations about him.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.786
<i>Hello and welcome</i>
<i>to GymnasticsDoctor.com.</i>

15:12.870 --> 15:16.582
<i>This is part of the sports medicine</i>
<i>tender teaching moments.</i>

15:16.665 --> 15:18.167
<i>I call these TTX.</i>

15:18.250 --> 15:19.418
<i>Over and over and over.</i>

15:19.501 --> 15:21.003
<i>Around and around and around.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:22.713
It's amazing, the number of treatments

15:22.796 --> 15:25.007
that these kids will get
to keep them healthy enough

15:25.090 --> 15:27.635
to sustain them
at the World Championship level,

15:27.718 --> 15:29.595
Olympic Championship level
that they are.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.847
Um, we'll treat them before practice.

15:31.930 --> 15:35.267
We treat them after practice, then
we treat them before the second practice.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.811
There are two a day. We're there
for the entire second practice.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.147
Then we treat them
to the point that they go to bed.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.982
So we usually see them
at seven in the morning

15:42.066 --> 15:43.525
and get done at ten at night.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.118
[man] In medical school, he worked
as a trainer. He rose up as a volunteer.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.621
And then, when he got on the staff
at Michigan State,

15:55.704 --> 15:58.123
part of his requirement
was to do community work.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.667
[applause]

15:59.750 --> 16:02.294
He started a foundation
for autistic children.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.423
And he seemed like
this larger-than-life, um,

16:06.507 --> 16:08.092
better-than-real person.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.762
Okay, let's see what else you guys have...

16:12.846 --> 16:14.306
discovered down here.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.477
We very quickly
started putting together a story,

16:18.978 --> 16:21.897
and we split up those sources.

16:23.148 --> 16:29.279
So Marisa flew out to California and, uh,
met with John Manly and Jamie Dantzscher.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.535
[Evans] Jessica Howard, at that time,
had spoken to us,

16:34.618 --> 16:38.956
but was not ready to be included
in the story, even as a Jane Doe.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.917
But her story helped us have confidence,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.837
because it corroborated
everything we'd heard from Jamie

16:44.920 --> 16:46.338
and we'd heard from Rachael.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.135
[Alesia] I happened to get Rachael's tip.

16:52.678 --> 16:56.890
And she said it would be fine to do
an interview on camera, on the record,

16:56.974 --> 16:57.808
with her name...

16:58.475 --> 16:59.351
in her home.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.565
Tell me more about why now, why...

17:04.648 --> 17:09.445
you know, why... why you're willing
to be brave enough to talk with me.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.365
Um, I didn't know a lot when I was 15,

17:13.449 --> 17:16.827
but one thing I did know was that
abuse victims aren't treated well.

17:17.453 --> 17:22.249
They are mocked. They are questioned.
They are blamed. They are shamed.

17:22.708 --> 17:27.212
Um, and that does incredible damage
to the healing process.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.631
I wish I could have dealt with it
16 years ago.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.426
I don't think I could have, but I can now.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.304
[mellow piano music playing]

17:37.431 --> 17:39.058
I was very much a perfectionist,

17:39.141 --> 17:41.894
and that's what attracted me
to the sport of gymnastics,

17:41.977 --> 17:43.812
was the perfection that it required.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.732
But my family
wasn't able to afford gym fees,

17:46.815 --> 17:48.901
so I didn't start until I was almost 12.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.861
Because, at that point, I could work,

17:50.944 --> 17:55.699
and my siblings helped me clean the gym,
and my mom worked to pay for my gym fees.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.163
But I was five-four when I started.
Way too tall, long torso, wrong body type.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.501
So I only competed at the club level
and a low club level at that.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.211
So I only competed in Michigan.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.671
I did it because I loved it.
I was not any good.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.427
[Dantzscher] I told my parents
I wanted to do gymnastics

18:15.511 --> 18:16.887
when I was three years old.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.264
'Cause I saw it on TV and...

18:20.015 --> 18:22.518
I just saw these girls...

18:23.018 --> 18:26.438
-flipping and twisting and flying.
-[crowd applauding]

18:27.564 --> 18:30.567
And I just...
I wanted to be able to do that.

18:32.861 --> 18:36.115
It was like my first love.
I loved everything about it.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.535
I was crazy. I look back now,

18:39.618 --> 18:44.748
and I was chucking triple-backs
off a mini trampoline into the pit.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.792
And I was... I was only nine years old.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.253
I had no idea how talented I was.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.547
I was just...
I was just having a good time.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.259
[man] <i>This is</i>
<i>15-year-old Jamie Dantzscher,</i>

18:55.342 --> 18:58.095
<i>who's making a move tonight</i>
<i>after a fine beam routine.</i>

18:58.178 --> 19:01.557
[classical music playing]

19:01.640 --> 19:05.769
[Dantzscher] I trained
with Beth and Steve Rybacki

19:05.853 --> 19:08.522
at Gliders Gymnastics from...

19:09.273 --> 19:11.275
eleven to 18 years old.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.445
I went from training
about<i> </i>18 hours a week...

19:16.113 --> 19:18.115
to about 30 to 35.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.367
At that time, I was like,<i> </i>

19:20.450 --> 19:23.579
"Yes, I get to be in the gym more
and train more."

19:23.662 --> 19:25.414
Like, I couldn't get enough of it.

19:26.665 --> 19:31.128
Anything they said it would take
to get to the Olympics,

19:31.211 --> 19:33.213
I was going to do.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.217
Come on, Jamie.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.308
[Dantzscher] I remember
having stone bruises on my heels.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.102
I couldn't even, like, walk on the carpet.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.899
I mean, I had broken toes
I competed on and trained on,

19:51.982 --> 19:54.151
a fractured back I actually competed on.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.947
-[woman] <i>Oh! Bela's gonna love that one!</i>
-[crowd cheering]

20:01.617 --> 20:04.953
But yet, it was like every time
I had an injury, I wasn't believed.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.126
[man]<i> You can see Bela Karolyi back there.</i>
<i>He seems to always be back there.</i>

20:11.210 --> 20:13.253
[crowd cheering]

20:13.337 --> 20:14.963
[Dantzscher] As far as weight...

20:15.631 --> 20:17.007
I remember I had the flu.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.635
I was literally throwing up
for five days straight.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.637
And I remember getting weighed,

20:21.720 --> 20:25.682
and I'd lost, I think,
like six pounds from being sick.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.059
And...

20:27.559 --> 20:30.145
I remember Beth telling me...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.981
you know, "You lost six pounds.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.234
Now we've got to figure out
how to keep it off."

20:36.693 --> 20:41.323
And to hear they don't care how you do it
had a huge effect on me.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.329
I mean, back then,
I didn't even think of it as abuse.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.500
That's kind of--

20:53.961 --> 20:55.587
It's still psychological for me,

20:55.671 --> 20:58.215
'cause I almost still feel bad for even...

20:59.341 --> 21:00.259
saying the truth.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.301
Like I almost...

21:01.885 --> 21:06.181
Like I hate this sentence, but I actually,
like, looked forward to treatment.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.143
And-- Because Larry was...

21:13.855 --> 21:15.816
the only nice adult.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.610
He's really the only nice adult
I could remember...

21:19.611 --> 21:20.445
being...

21:21.947 --> 21:24.366
a part of USA Gymnastics staff.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.451
[crowd cheering, applauding]

21:28.328 --> 21:29.454
He was really the only...

21:31.498 --> 21:33.375
nice adult there.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.754
[ethereal music playing]

21:40.465 --> 21:42.467
[indistinct chattering]

21:56.023 --> 21:56.857
[man] Yeah.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.109
That's it.

22:00.444 --> 22:04.406
[Maggie] So when I was, like, 13, that's
when I qualified for elite gymnastics.

22:04.489 --> 22:08.410
And when I was<i> </i>15,
I finally made the national team.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.585
[crowd cheering]

22:18.378 --> 22:21.256
[woman]<i> If she keeps this up,</i>
<i>she has a great shot</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:23.675
<i>to make that Olympic team next year.</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:25.677
[man] <i>She's still right in the hunt...</i>

22:26.511 --> 22:28.055
<i>to come second to Simone.</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:33.477
[Maggie]<i> </i>The national team camp
was in Texas.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.688
And Martha and Bela Karolyi owned it.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.025
Martha would walk out of her office,
and we'd all... [gasps]

22:40.108 --> 22:42.486
...go like this
and go shortest to tallest in a line.

22:43.653 --> 22:45.697
We trained about seven hours a day.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.241
And they ranked us from top to bottom.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.494
We just had so many eyes on us.

22:50.577 --> 22:54.289
National staff, our own home coaches,
other athletes.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.041
So it was pretty intense.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.253
[Gina] I remember Maggie saying
that it was really scary,

23:01.004 --> 23:02.631
and they were very strict.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.840
But it was an honor.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.884
That's where the Olympic athletes
come from.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.637
You get on that team,
and now you have a shot.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.728
[Gina] The parents were never allowed
to go to the ranch.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.607
I could hardly ever talk to her
when she was there

23:20.690 --> 23:22.776
because they didn't have
cell phone reception.

23:24.528 --> 23:29.199
[John] It was a strict way
to make them stronger...

23:29.699 --> 23:31.660
and better for their sport.

23:33.203 --> 23:37.999
And so we had to, you know,
trust and believe in... in their system.

23:40.001 --> 23:42.170
You know, you would think
they'd be able to keep,

23:42.546 --> 23:44.881
you know, people safe.
Especially when we're...

23:45.424 --> 23:48.093
not allowed to set foot on the property.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.846
But I knew nothing about Nassar.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.640
I never even thought
to ask those questions,

23:53.723 --> 23:55.559
because I didn't even know he was there.

24:00.981 --> 24:05.944
[Maggie] In 2015,
Larry was doing treatments for my back.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.406
And there's this room called the back room

24:09.489 --> 24:12.492
where we, like, watched TV
and got massages and stuff.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.828
Um, he would just do it right there.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.539
And I was just, like,
kind of, like, confused

24:17.622 --> 24:19.749
and, like, wondering what it was.

24:19.833 --> 24:20.959
It didn't seem right.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.296
Um, because I grew up always going
to physical therapy and stuff,

24:24.379 --> 24:26.339
because I had many injuries growing up,

24:26.423 --> 24:28.633
um, and I'd never experienced
anything like that.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.302
So I thought I'd ask Aly just 'cause...

24:30.802 --> 24:33.847
I mean, we were really close friends,
and she was older, too,

24:33.930 --> 24:36.975
and has been to national team camps
and has worked with him before.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.896
So I kind of just asked her. I was like,
"Does he do this to you? Is this normal?"

24:40.979 --> 24:43.523
And she said,
"Yeah, like, he does it to me, too."

24:48.069 --> 24:51.198
Maggie's coach, Sarah Jantzi,
called me up, and she said,

24:51.281 --> 24:55.076
"I want to let you know that I overheard
from Maggie and another athlete...

24:55.619 --> 24:57.704
that Larry Nassar was touching her funny,

24:57.787 --> 25:01.333
and Maggie told her he was,
you know, touching her private parts.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.878
He was putting his hands in her vagina,
and he was fingering her."

25:04.961 --> 25:05.795
And I'm like...

25:06.379 --> 25:07.422
"What?"

25:09.883 --> 25:11.676
And I said, 
"We need to call the authorities."

25:11.760 --> 25:13.762
And she said,
"Yeah, I'm gonna call Rhonda Faehn,

25:13.845 --> 25:17.182
who is in charge of the women's program,
right away." So she did.

25:18.516 --> 25:21.436
And then, the next day,
Steve Penny called me.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.438
I've never spoken to him personally.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.814
All he said was,

25:24.898 --> 25:26.566
"I hear you have a concern."

25:27.192 --> 25:28.568
I said, "A concern?

25:29.236 --> 25:32.030
I have... This is...
My daughter was molested.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.199
We need to call the authorities."

25:34.282 --> 25:37.786
He said, "No, no, no, don't worry
about that. I will take care of that.

25:37.869 --> 25:41.164
USA Gymnastics
will take care of calling the police."

25:42.707 --> 25:45.919
Three or four weeks later,
Steve Penny calls me again,

25:46.002 --> 25:49.714
and he says, "Well, now,
we want you to talk to an investigator.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.216
Her name is Fran Sepler."

25:51.800 --> 25:55.595
I thought "Well, maybe this is what
they do with child sexual abuse cases."

25:55.679 --> 25:58.181
I'd never been involved with one,
so I didn't know.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.642
You know, at competitions, following...

26:01.142 --> 26:02.727
you know, Maggie's reporting...

26:03.270 --> 26:05.397
Steve Penny would always tell me...

26:06.022 --> 26:07.691
that, "Don't worry about Maggie.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.903
We'll take care of Maggie.
Don't worry about Maggie. We got Maggie."

26:12.404 --> 26:14.406
So why would I not believe him?

26:14.864 --> 26:18.535
You know, we're talking USA Gymnastics.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.537
We're talking US Olympics.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.840
-[phone beeps]
-[Evans] Can you hear us all right?

26:31.923 --> 26:34.342
<i>-I can. Can you hear me?</i>
-Yeah, we've got you on speaker,

26:34.426 --> 26:36.928
-so if it's weird, let us know.
<i>-Okay.</i>

26:37.721 --> 26:40.390
So... This is Steve Berta.

26:40.473 --> 26:44.811
When you were active in gymnastics,
were there coaches,

26:44.894 --> 26:50.066
or other officials like Nassar,
who the girls were suspicious of

26:50.150 --> 26:53.445
or talked about as being abusive?

26:54.070 --> 26:55.196
[Sey] <i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:57.824
<i>There were sexual predators everywhere.</i>

26:57.907 --> 26:59.075
<i>They were in my gym.</i>

26:59.159 --> 27:03.872
<i>The national team coach, Don Peters,</i>
<i>was a known sexual abuser.</i>

27:04.414 --> 27:07.626
<i>They were everywhere across the country,</i>
<i>and we knew who they were.</i>

27:08.209 --> 27:13.298
<i>Uh, but, more broadly, emotional</i>
<i>and physical abuse was actually the norm,</i>

27:13.381 --> 27:16.384
<i>and we were all so beaten down by that...</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:19.346
<i>um, and made so obedient</i>

27:19.429 --> 27:24.893
<i>that, when we knew that there was</i>
<i>a sexual abuser in our midst,</i>

27:24.976 --> 27:27.437
<i>we would never say anything.</i>
<i>We were just...</i>

27:28.605 --> 27:30.315
<i>We felt utterly powerless.</i>

27:31.566 --> 27:34.027
[crowd applauding]

27:34.110 --> 27:37.822
[woman]<i> Now watch her face after</i>
<i>this tumbling pass. She's hurt her ankle.</i>

27:37.906 --> 27:40.116
<i>Do you see that little grimace?</i>
<i>It hurts her.</i>

27:40.200 --> 27:42.952
[man]<i> But she must go on here,</i>
<i>the title at stake.</i>

27:43.578 --> 27:46.706
<i>The courage of Jennifer Sey</i>
<i>led her on to the title</i>

27:46.790 --> 27:50.335
<i>as women's all-around champion of the USA,</i>

27:50.418 --> 27:52.504
<i>but the pain was a heavy price.</i>

27:54.756 --> 27:57.258
[Sey]<i> </i>I started the sport in the mid-'70s.

27:57.884 --> 28:01.471
And, I would say, the standard methodology

28:01.554 --> 28:05.392
of coaching in elite gymnastics
was cruelty.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.185
That was the accepted methodology.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.354
You could be as cruel as you needed to be

28:09.437 --> 28:11.564
to get what you needed
out of your athlete.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.525
Um, so this is not new.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.653
We just weren't good at it.
We weren't getting great results.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.196
We were getting okay results.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.408
[crowd cheering]

28:22.659 --> 28:25.078
[man]<i> Bela and Martha Karolyi,</i>
<i>husband and wife,</i>

28:25.161 --> 28:26.871
<i>and what a coaching team they are.</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:32.085
[Sey] And then Bela and Martha Karolyi
came here, and they...

28:32.585 --> 28:35.296
validated that approach.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.009
If success is winning, you know,
medals in the Olympics,

28:40.093 --> 28:43.680
then, you know, they proved that
that methodology was successful

28:43.763 --> 28:45.682
and was the right way to coach.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.270
People know the Karolyis, but I'm not sure
many of them really know their history.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.400
[woman]<i> Chris, this could be the highlight</i>
<i>of the compulsory event.</i>

28:55.483 --> 29:00.196
<i>She is one of the technically strongest,</i>
<i>best gymnasts that I've ever seen.</i>

29:01.197 --> 29:02.157
<i>Watch this.</i>

29:03.199 --> 29:05.493
<i>Beautiful rhythm. Right to a handstand.</i>

29:06.661 --> 29:08.371
<i>Oh, look at that amplitude.</i>

29:08.455 --> 29:09.581
<i>Ooh!</i>

29:10.165 --> 29:13.209
[man]<i> Faultless. Absolutely faultless.</i>

29:14.335 --> 29:15.670
<i>Nadia Comaneci.</i>

29:16.045 --> 29:18.298
<i>Now, what are the judges</i>
<i>gonna say about that?</i>

29:18.381 --> 29:19.591
<i>There's the smile.</i>

29:20.175 --> 29:22.177
<i>Some cynics say it had to be trained...</i>

29:22.844 --> 29:24.345
<i>because she so rarely smiles.</i>

29:25.847 --> 29:30.101
[Manly] They were
Nicolae Ceausescu's chosen coaches

29:30.185 --> 29:32.312
for the Romanian national gymnastics team.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.191
And they coached Nadia Comaneci
to a gold medal in 1976.

29:41.404 --> 29:44.991
[Sey] If you look back at teams
from the '50s and the '60s,

29:45.074 --> 29:46.493
they look like grown women.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.744
They are grown women.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.791
But that started to change
in the late '60s,

29:52.874 --> 29:57.003
but really solidified in 1976

29:57.086 --> 30:00.423
when Nadia won the Olympics
as a 14-year-old.

30:01.341 --> 30:06.095
And there was just this mad rush of
little girls that wanted to do gymnastics,

30:06.179 --> 30:08.097
'cause we related to her.

30:08.181 --> 30:14.103
And what emerged was an aesthetic
that was very, very young. Childlike.

30:14.854 --> 30:18.399
And so it created
a really dangerous environment,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.528
because eating disorders
became very prevalent.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.404
You know, delaying menstruation

30:23.488 --> 30:25.281
and delaying maturation.

30:26.115 --> 30:29.118
But I think people really believed

30:29.202 --> 30:33.706
that, for the more difficult skills
to be performed, you had to be tiny.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.709
There's also the benefit of the coaches

30:36.793 --> 30:38.920
having more control
when the girls are younger.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.885
[crowd cheering]

30:46.553 --> 30:48.263
[Manly] What's important
for people to know

30:48.930 --> 30:52.225
is that Nicolae Ceausescu and his regime

30:52.809 --> 30:57.230
was arguably the most repressive regime
in the Eastern Bloc.

30:58.606 --> 31:02.610
And the Karolyis were part of<i> </i>that system.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.910
[man] The Romanians started this idea

31:11.411 --> 31:14.622
of training gymnasts
from a very young age.

31:16.791 --> 31:20.795
Like from six years old,
they are selected from their kindergarten

31:20.879 --> 31:22.922
or elementary schools,

31:23.006 --> 31:24.257
and we tested them.

31:26.092 --> 31:29.679
Flexibility, strength and, uh, no fear.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.848
-[woman] No fear?
-No fear, yes. No fear.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.313
We have to put this in the context
of the Cold War.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.024
The Soviet Union or Romania,

31:41.107 --> 31:44.402
they could not say,
"Okay, we build better products

31:44.485 --> 31:46.738
than the American side."

31:47.906 --> 31:49.490
But we can have Nadia Comaneci.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.077
Nadia was Romania's best product.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.538
[laughing]

31:56.581 --> 31:58.499
[man 1 speaking French]

31:59.334 --> 32:00.835
[speaking Romanian]

32:01.210 --> 32:03.504
[man 2 speaking French]

32:05.506 --> 32:10.386
[woman] 1976, Nadia was definitely
the one to be like at that point,

32:10.470 --> 32:13.514
and<i> </i>the Russians, the Romanians,
the East Germans,

32:13.598 --> 32:16.517
all the, what we call the Communist Bloc,

32:16.601 --> 32:18.853
they were the best, by far, in the sport.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.732
And certainly, you always want to be
like the ones who are winning.

32:24.067 --> 32:29.614
But we would be at competitions,
and they always seemed very scared.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.907
The gymnasts did.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.784
And you never saw them talk,

32:32.867 --> 32:35.203
and they almost looked like robots.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.623
The-- All I can say is the athletes...

32:39.415 --> 32:41.918
did not look happy, ever.

32:44.545 --> 32:47.256
[Pozsar] From the very beginning,
Bela had this idea

32:47.840 --> 32:51.010
that we will have total control
over the girls

32:51.094 --> 32:52.428
absolute control.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.390
Bela was controlling their weight.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.518
They had to step every single day
on a scale.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.146
He was yelling at them
and putting them down.

33:02.981 --> 33:03.856
"Fat cow."

33:04.565 --> 33:05.733
"You are a pig."

33:06.442 --> 33:08.361
He, you know, slapped the girls,

33:08.444 --> 33:10.863
and the girls were very, very scared.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.369
Martha had this habit
of grabbing their neck

33:16.452 --> 33:19.038
and get her fingers into their necks.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.625
Plus slap them, you know, a lot.

33:22.709 --> 33:28.715
The girls have the<i> </i>prints of the...
her rings on their faces sometimes.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.884
[woman] Did you report it
to the authorities?

33:31.968 --> 33:35.555
[Pozsar] Yes, sure. I reported them,
but also you have to understand

33:35.638 --> 33:39.684
that nobody took any kind of measures,
you know, to stop them.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.563
In Romania, that was acceptable.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.648
[country music playing]

33:45.732 --> 33:49.694
[man]<i> When he heads for his ranch</i>
<i>on a rural highway north of Houston,</i>

33:54.198 --> 33:56.784
<i>and a day's collection of bugs</i>

33:57.410 --> 34:00.496
<i>well, you'd swear you were riding</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:07.253
<i>When Bela Karolyi defected to the West,</i>
<i>he defected to the West.</i>

34:07.336 --> 34:10.673
Wee-hoo! Yip, yip!

34:12.425 --> 34:14.343
[Pozsar] When we defected together...

34:15.344 --> 34:18.556
we knew that United States
has lots and lots of talent.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.559
We saw the talent
in the international competitions.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.731
And we know that it's
a very, very fertile soil

34:26.814 --> 34:28.232
for athletes in United States.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.988
[crowd cheering]

34:34.072 --> 34:38.659
I declare open
the Olympic Games of Los Angeles.

34:48.211 --> 34:49.045
Mary Lou.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.173
Never better, okay?

34:53.049 --> 34:55.843
The best...
the best what you can vault, all right?

34:59.764 --> 35:02.350
[Talavera] With Bela and Martha
coming over here...

35:03.226 --> 35:08.397
we copy, cut, paste their style,
and now we're doing it in the US.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.652
We knew what their system was,

35:12.735 --> 35:14.946
but we also knew they won all the time.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.003
[man shouting]

35:31.087 --> 35:32.505
[crowd cheering]

35:32.588 --> 35:34.590
[screaming]

35:36.342 --> 35:37.468
[indistinct shouting]

35:37.552 --> 35:40.721
America loves a winner.
And when a perky little bundle of energy

35:40.805 --> 35:44.725
from West Virginia named Mary Lou Retton
took home the gold medal in gymnastics

35:44.809 --> 35:47.603
at the '84 Olympics,
she became the national sweetheart.

35:48.354 --> 35:51.607
[man] I was the president
of USA Gymnastics in '84,

35:51.691 --> 35:55.236
and one of my goals was I wanted
our property on all the networks.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.281
That was the most valuable thing
we could do to build our brand,

35:58.364 --> 35:59.532
the image of our sport.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.411
And then, all of a sudden,
gymnastics was earning

36:03.494 --> 36:06.664
almost $12 million a year in revenue
in 1991.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.793
[Alesia] USA Gymnastics
had a wholesome image,

36:10.877 --> 36:15.798
and they had companies
who wanted to be attached to that image.

36:15.882 --> 36:21.012
And that image was vital, uh, to protect.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.685
[Penny] What makes this sport so special
are the athletes.

36:28.102 --> 36:31.063
I've never seen athletes
that train as hard as these guys do

36:31.147 --> 36:33.900
and that are as intelligent
and personable.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.943
I mean, it's just the complete package.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.656
[Evans] Steve Penny was hired
as vice president of marketing

36:40.740 --> 36:41.866
when they started out.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.661
He worked with television marketing,
then he worked with USA Cycling.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.832
And, um, by the end of the '90s,

36:49.916 --> 36:53.377
the focus of USA Gymnastics
just became raising money...

36:54.045 --> 36:55.546
attracting sponsorships

36:55.630 --> 36:58.633
and, you know, making the best
out of their Olympic athletes.

37:00.885 --> 37:05.932
[Berta] Eventually, Steve Penny
became the president of USA Gymnastics.

37:07.683 --> 37:12.063
So you had an organization
that was run by a sports marketing expert.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.565
And, uh, that's what he cared about.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.401
He cared about marketing this brand.

37:17.485 --> 37:21.572
[man]<i> This is the image of Bela Karolyi</i>
<i>the world has grown accustomed to seeing.</i>

37:22.156 --> 37:24.033
<i>The intense, relentless coach</i>

37:24.116 --> 37:27.620
<i>who now turns out championship gymnasts</i>
<i>for the United States.</i>

37:29.872 --> 37:33.084
[Berta] You know, these children
are all being advised by adults

37:33.167 --> 37:36.587
as to how they can realize
their Olympic dream.

37:37.296 --> 37:43.094
So you're basically using
that child's dream to build this brand.

37:44.887 --> 37:48.516
And they were so busy
trying to sell that brand...

37:49.517 --> 37:52.478
that they didn't have time
for those girls.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.438
[crowd cheering]

37:54.522 --> 37:56.857
[man] Right now, 
we turn to women's gymnastics

37:56.941 --> 37:59.735
and the United States,
which has become a power in recent years,

37:59.819 --> 38:01.904
now looking to become the power.

38:04.240 --> 38:09.370
I remember watching the Olympics
in my little apartment, um, in 1996.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.374
And Kerri Strug was vaulting.

38:14.375 --> 38:18.170
And it was viewed sort of
as this heroic Olympic achievement,

38:18.254 --> 38:21.299
but I saw it differently at the time.

38:21.882 --> 38:26.220
[man] <i>So, Kerri Strug,</i>
<i>if she can score 9.493...</i>

38:26.929 --> 38:29.390
<i>then she will win the team gold...</i>

38:30.016 --> 38:30.975
<i>for the USA.</i>

38:31.058 --> 38:33.769
<i>She's the last to go.</i>
<i>She's the only one who can do it.</i>

38:38.357 --> 38:39.358
<i>Oh!</i>

38:40.693 --> 38:41.819
[woman] <i>This is scary.</i>

38:41.902 --> 38:43.070
[man] <i>She is limping.</i>

38:43.154 --> 38:45.656
<i>Here's the reaction of her parents.</i>

38:47.325 --> 38:51.662
And she falls on the first vault,
and she's clearly in a lot of pain.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.457
She's limping back
to the other end of the runway.

38:55.124 --> 38:59.378
We learn afterwards that
she had been competing on a severe injury.

38:59.462 --> 39:02.006
You can do it. You can do it.

39:02.715 --> 39:05.426
[Sey] You get two vaults,
and the highest score counts.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.887
And Team USA needed that second vault.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.346
All right.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.183
-[man] Go.
-Go! Go!

39:12.725 --> 39:15.019
-[woman] Come on! Come on!
-[crowd cheers]

39:15.102 --> 39:18.314
[Sey] And she does it.
She lands the vault on one foot.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.232
[man] <i>Kerri Strug is hurt.</i>

39:21.150 --> 39:23.527
[Sey] And she literally crawls
off the mat.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.738
She crawls away.

39:26.155 --> 39:27.865
[man] <i>Everyone in this place is...</i>

39:27.948 --> 39:31.577
[Sey] And Larry Nassar,
at the time nobody knew, but is there.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.163
[crowd cheering]

39:34.246 --> 39:35.873
[man] <i>She's being carried off...</i>

39:36.415 --> 39:38.167
<i>by two of the medical technicians.</i>

39:40.002 --> 39:43.714
<i>We have got to find out if she's--</i>
<i>A 9.712! She has done it!</i>

39:44.423 --> 39:48.010
<i>Kerri Strug has won the gold medal</i>
<i>for the United States team.</i>

39:49.428 --> 39:51.639
<i>The Russians are in tears.</i>

39:55.351 --> 39:58.729
<i>They got so close,</i>
<i>and the Americans took it away from them.</i>

40:01.315 --> 40:04.110
[Sey]<i> </i>And Bela swept her up
and carried her off.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.614
And everybody's cheering her on
as this hero,

40:08.697 --> 40:12.785
and all I could think was,
"Why are we celebrating this?

40:13.869 --> 40:15.704
Don't pretend she had a choice."

40:15.788 --> 40:17.081
Wave to the people.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.669
She was not gonna do anything
but go do that vault.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.005
We love winners in this country.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.757
This is a competitive country.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.885
We consider ourselves
the best in the world at everything.

40:30.761 --> 40:31.595
Right?

40:31.679 --> 40:36.142
But this notion that we would sacrifice
our young to win...

40:37.184 --> 40:38.644
I think disgusts us a little.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.397
We would never have said
that that was the case.

40:49.905 --> 40:52.450
You know, in other sports,
the athletes are adults.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.203
They can reasonably make choices
about what they want.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.166
I don't think that is true in gymnastics.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.753
You know, these kids go to these
national training centers

41:04.837 --> 41:06.046
when they're ten years old.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.508
They are abused and mistreated...

41:10.259 --> 41:11.260
for years.

41:11.343 --> 41:13.095
So even by the time they're of age,

41:13.179 --> 41:18.851
the line between tough coaching
and child abuse gets blurred.

41:21.479 --> 41:26.901
So then when real, like, obvious abuse,
sexual abuse happens,

41:26.984 --> 41:30.237
you already don't believe
your own take on things.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.866
Because you think you're hungry.
You think your ankle hurts.<i> </i>[laughs]

41:33.949 --> 41:36.285
You think that you're working really hard.

41:36.952 --> 41:40.080
But you're told and you're screamed at
that you're lazy and fat

41:40.164 --> 41:43.334
and there's nothing wrong with your ankle.
So when a man...

41:44.251 --> 41:48.339
puts his ungloved hand into your vagina
without asking you,

41:48.422 --> 41:51.342
I can only imagine that what you feel is,

41:51.425 --> 41:54.762
"He's this great doctor, and I'm lucky
to be here. I'm not gonna say anything."

42:03.229 --> 42:05.356
[Nassar] <i>We protect our athletes.</i>

42:05.439 --> 42:09.151
<i>Not just physically, but mentally...</i>

42:09.735 --> 42:12.571
<i>you have to protect your athletes.</i>

42:13.280 --> 42:14.990
<i>If you screw up once...</i>

42:16.033 --> 42:20.871
<i>if you do something</i>
<i>where you break their trust, you're done.</i>

42:22.039 --> 42:24.124
<i>Gymnasts first. Gymnasts first.</i>

42:24.708 --> 42:25.751
<i>Gymnasts first.</i>

42:28.045 --> 42:29.880
[Manly] The environment and the culture

42:29.964 --> 42:32.758
Bela and Martha Karolyi
created at the ranch

42:32.841 --> 42:33.968
was one of fear...

42:34.718 --> 42:35.803
intimidation...

42:36.345 --> 42:37.555
and silence.

42:38.222 --> 42:42.059
The only bright light at that place
was Larry Nassar.

42:42.142 --> 42:44.687
It's just a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
I like to call it.

42:44.770 --> 42:47.731
You just go, "Bib, bib, bib,
bob, bob, bob, boo, boo, boo."

42:47.815 --> 42:49.441
So a little bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.359
There. [pops]

42:50.442 --> 42:52.903
Pop goes the weasel. So this little ball--

42:52.987 --> 42:55.281
[Manly] He was kind. He was funny.

42:55.364 --> 42:56.574
He made them laugh.

42:56.657 --> 42:59.034
[Nassar] I can articulate it, go...
[gibbering]

42:59.118 --> 43:02.371
That's what I do when I articulate. Okay?
And then I thrust--

43:02.454 --> 43:04.873
[Manly] He snuck them snacks
and gave them food,

43:04.957 --> 43:07.167
and he engendered trust
in all these women.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.462
Nassar was everything
the Karolyis were not.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.007
Thank you for visiting
GymnasticsDoctor.com,

43:13.090 --> 43:15.384
where you can see
over 400 educational videos

43:15.467 --> 43:17.553
on how to rehabilitate your gymnast.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.515
[Manly] To try and justify
the methodology that he used,

43:21.598 --> 43:24.643
Larry Nassar produced dozens of videos

43:24.727 --> 43:27.187
of him doing these various,

43:27.271 --> 43:30.357
what he described as osteopathic,
procedures to little girls.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.776
It runs through this tunnel

43:32.860 --> 43:37.906
from the ilial... um, uh, iliac crest
to the pubic symphysis, and there's a--

43:37.990 --> 43:42.536
[Manly] He has an excellent command
of anatomical vocabulary.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.121
And it all seems legitimate.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.874
A standard...
this is like a standard tape job.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.293
Um, this will help
for, like, up the muscles.

43:49.376 --> 43:52.296
So we're gonna give her
a little bit of a wedgie here.

43:52.379 --> 43:55.424
Or a lot of a wedgie, you could say.
Okay? When you do this--

43:55.507 --> 43:58.761
[Manly] But if you tune that out
and really watched what he did...

43:59.928 --> 44:04.475
the frequency and the ease
at which he touched little children

44:04.558 --> 44:06.769
was just wildly inappropriate.

44:10.230 --> 44:12.566
[Dantzscher] When I met Larry Nassar...

44:13.734 --> 44:15.653
I was young.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.073
[indistinct chattering]

44:19.281 --> 44:21.825
They were doing testing on everybody.

44:21.909 --> 44:25.788
You know, "We just want to make sure
everyone's healthy on national team."

44:27.373 --> 44:29.375
And Larry gave me a physical.

44:30.376 --> 44:31.251
And he...

44:32.044 --> 44:34.296
got me completely naked.

44:34.838 --> 44:36.090
And I thought that was...

44:36.674 --> 44:37.508
normal.

44:43.722 --> 44:46.225
[Manly] When they went
in his office at the ranch,

44:46.308 --> 44:48.852
the walls were littered
with pictures of Olympians.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.729
"I treated her. Oh, yeah."

44:50.813 --> 44:54.441
And then he would get a call.
And it was Martha<i> </i>Karolyi on the line.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.319
And he would discuss
one of the gymnasts' health

44:57.403 --> 44:59.530
while this person
was sitting on his table,

44:59.613 --> 45:02.366
which, you know, to a little child,
is very impressive.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.201
It's a HIPAA violation,

45:04.743 --> 45:06.328
but it's impressive to a child.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.045
[Denhollander]
The first time I went to see Larry,

45:15.129 --> 45:18.298
it was at MSU sports medicine clinic
in early 2000.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.968
I was barely 15 years old.

45:22.928 --> 45:25.556
I had a lot of low back pain
and a lot of wrist pain,

45:25.639 --> 45:29.643
to the point that it got very difficult
just to do basic daily chores.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.562
Lay down on the table for me.

45:32.187 --> 45:34.565
On your back
with your ponytail off the edge.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.817
So if I allow for non-stretch--

45:36.900 --> 45:38.861
[Denhollander] He asked
to do myofascial release,

45:38.944 --> 45:41.572
which I knew was a legitimate
physical therapy technique,

45:41.655 --> 45:44.158
and he did that with his right hand,
externally.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.993
He did legitimate therapy.

45:46.076 --> 45:49.288
And with his left,
he sexually assaulted me under the towel.

45:49.371 --> 45:51.331
Arms up over the head.
So now she's on--

45:51.415 --> 45:54.251
He would position himself
in between me and my mom.

45:54.668 --> 45:58.589
But since she was so close, I presumed
that she was aware of what was going on.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.425
I didn't know until months later
that she had no idea.

46:01.508 --> 46:05.262
She couldn't see where his other hand was.
He was intentionally blocking it.

46:05.345 --> 46:06.847
If she leaps and jumps--

46:07.222 --> 46:09.266
[Denhollander] There was
definitely an escalation.

46:09.516 --> 46:11.769
He started anal penetration over time.

46:12.519 --> 46:14.438
Then, on one of the last appointments,

46:14.521 --> 46:18.692
he unhooked my bra and went up my shirt
and did a full-on breast massage.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.944
He was clearly sexually aroused.

46:22.988 --> 46:26.450
It was an average of once a month.
I saw him for a little over a year.

46:26.533 --> 46:29.244
And on the majority of those visits,
he abused me.

46:32.706 --> 46:35.667
It was something that was always present.
I couldn't just put it away.

46:36.585 --> 46:37.628
Some years later,

46:37.711 --> 46:41.173
I went to the head coach at
the gymnastics facility where I worked...

46:41.673 --> 46:45.469
and I said, "Larry sexually abused me
under the guise of a medical exam."

46:45.552 --> 46:47.721
I told her
that no one should be seeing him.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.600
When I was told... "No one else is saying
what you're saying..."

46:52.518 --> 46:53.894
um, and...

46:54.394 --> 46:58.398
and cautioned even about speaking out,
because of the ramifications...

46:58.941 --> 47:02.528
that really solidified to me,
"There's nothing I can do. Not right now."

47:05.197 --> 47:07.658
[crowd cheering]

47:09.535 --> 47:10.994

47:14.289 --> 47:16.041
<i>Jamie Dantzscher!</i>

47:22.381 --> 47:25.884
[Dantzscher] When they announced my name,
I was really able to take in that moment,

47:25.968 --> 47:29.304
to feel like
maybe all of this was worth it.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.353
[man] <i>Bela has selected his team!</i>

47:39.481 --> 47:42.234
But, for me, the Olympics were not...

47:42.901 --> 47:44.194
a dream come true.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.112
[crowd cheering]

47:45.195 --> 47:48.824
[man]<i> The United States</i>
<i>makes its entrance. Look at the smiles.</i>

47:48.907 --> 47:51.326
<i>Look at the waving flags,</i>
<i>the new uniforms.</i>

47:53.829 --> 47:55.956
[woman]<i> </i>Was Larry abusive at the Olympics?

47:56.039 --> 47:56.874
Yes.

47:57.916 --> 48:01.003
Yes. Larry was abusive at the Olympics.

48:02.504 --> 48:05.132
When we got there,
we had to train morning and night.

48:07.050 --> 48:11.513
And all that stress, physically
and mentally, to do that every day...

48:12.431 --> 48:14.433
My back was always so bad.

48:14.516 --> 48:17.686
I mean, I had to get adjustments...

48:18.645 --> 48:19.479
every day.

48:20.022 --> 48:21.607
Sometimes, four times a day.

48:23.817 --> 48:25.694
I thought that's what was helping me.

48:26.778 --> 48:29.364
And he would sneak us food and candy.

48:32.659 --> 48:34.620
And leave stuff under our pillows.

48:40.542 --> 48:43.253
I wasn't proud to be an Olympian.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.220
[ethereal music playing]

49:49.486 --> 49:52.489
Maggie reports the child sexual abuse

49:52.572 --> 49:55.367
in, you know, the very beginning
of June of 2015.

49:55.951 --> 49:58.620
And actually, she had a huge, huge year.

49:58.704 --> 50:00.998
I mean, she was doing awesome.

50:01.081 --> 50:04.501
She was at the peak of her career.
Second again behind Simone Biles.

50:05.127 --> 50:06.586
But Maggie did phenomenal.

50:06.670 --> 50:10.340
I mean, she's amazing and beautiful,
and she's consistent and winning.

50:54.134 --> 50:57.220
The graduate of Roseville High School
is practically a shoo-in

50:57.304 --> 51:00.223
to be picked for Team USA next month
at the Olympic trials.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.559
It's such an honor that, you know,
all my hard work

51:02.642 --> 51:04.853
throughout my whole career is paying off,

51:04.936 --> 51:08.023
and I'll just be so honored
to represent the US and Minnesota.

51:08.106 --> 51:11.109
And I just want to do my best
and help Team USA.

[man]<i> NBC Sports presents</i>
<i>the 2016 Secret US Classic.</i>

51:22.078 --> 51:24.247
Well, Al, Maggie Nichols is not here.

51:24.331 --> 51:27.918
She is back home in Minnesota
working her way through a knee injury.

51:28.001 --> 51:32.672
This is an athlete
who had an amazing breakout 2015.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.967
And then Maggie tore her meniscus,
had to have surgery.

51:36.051 --> 51:39.221
But remember,
the last time Maggie Nichols was injured,

51:39.304 --> 51:42.933
she came back stronger,
physically and mentally.

51:43.016 --> 51:46.686
She was a completely different athlete.
We don't know what's gonna happen,

51:46.770 --> 51:49.481
but, Al, they don't call her Swaggy Maggie
for nothing.

51:54.152 --> 51:56.905
[John] Maggie had
kind of a rough couple of months...

51:57.739 --> 51:59.783
going into the Olympic trials.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.828
Uh, she had hurt her knee...

52:03.620 --> 52:05.580
um, at the ranch.

52:07.666 --> 52:09.835
She had a tough road ahead of her...

52:10.377 --> 52:12.504
you know, to try to make the Olympic team.

52:14.673 --> 52:18.635
[Gina] So we've got Maggie trying to rehab
a knee injury and a surgery,

52:19.219 --> 52:22.305
while in the meantime,
during the spring of 2016...

52:23.223 --> 52:28.019
Steve Penny controlled every single thing
that we did

52:28.103 --> 52:29.980
before we went to the Olympic trials.

52:31.356 --> 52:36.278
One thing was that Hershey's wanted
to make a commercial in honor of Simone.

52:36.361 --> 52:40.031
And the only people who were gonna be
in the commercial is Simone's family

52:40.115 --> 52:41.408
and a best friend or two.

52:42.325 --> 52:45.620
So she invites Maggie
to be in this commercial for her.

52:46.955 --> 52:51.293
So they get down there, and they
started filming in Simone's house.

52:51.376 --> 52:54.171
And then, all of a sudden,
the film crew for Hershey's

52:54.254 --> 52:56.006
gets a phone call from Steve Penny,

52:56.089 --> 52:58.550
saying Maggie is not gonna be
in that commercial.

52:59.050 --> 53:00.510
He was screaming and yelling,

53:00.594 --> 53:03.013
"I'm supposed to be in charge of this!
I'm in charge!"

53:03.680 --> 53:06.600
[woman] And you still haven't heard
anything from the FBI?

53:06.683 --> 53:08.810
Not one thing. I was told that they knew.

53:09.519 --> 53:12.522
Um, I was told
that the police were all over it,

53:12.606 --> 53:15.984
but Steve Penny told us
we could not talk about it.

53:16.067 --> 53:17.903
We really weren't gonna go...

53:18.570 --> 53:19.738
public or say anything,

53:19.821 --> 53:22.657
because we were told
that there's an FBI investigation,

53:22.741 --> 53:24.826
and we could possibly jeopardize it.

53:26.953 --> 53:30.081
And also, you know,
we didn't want to upset,

53:30.165 --> 53:33.293
you know, Steve Penny and Martha Karolyi.

53:34.336 --> 53:37.672
They knew
that Maggie reported Larry Nassar.

53:39.007 --> 53:42.385
We had to do
exactly what they wanted us to do.

53:43.136 --> 53:46.681
You know, they were the ones
that actually pick our Olympic team.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.517
They had us under the gun.

53:49.601 --> 53:51.853
They had the Olympics
hanging over our heads.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.355
[classical music playing]

53:53.438 --> 53:57.984
[man 1]<i> NBC Sports welcomes you</i>
<i>to the 2016 US Olympic trials.</i>

53:58.068 --> 54:01.363
<i>And this is a big stage</i>
<i>for 13 hopeful women.</i>

54:02.614 --> 54:05.158
<i>As we often say, the selection committee</i>
<i>is watching everything,</i>

54:05.241 --> 54:08.119
<i>but the two most important eyes</i>
<i>in the building are those.</i>

54:08.203 --> 54:11.331
<i>Martha Karolyi,</i>
<i>who's the boss of Team USA.</i>

54:11.414 --> 54:13.208
<i>But tonight, everybody's watching.</i>

54:13.291 --> 54:16.294
<i>We'll start things off with Maggie Nichols</i>
<i>on the vault.</i>

54:16.378 --> 54:21.132
<i>She's trying to get to the Olympic Games</i>
<i>after two really bad knee injuries.</i>

54:21.216 --> 54:24.052
[man 2]<i> Martha said,</i>
<i>for Maggie to be in the hunt,</i>

54:24.135 --> 54:27.764
<i>she has to be as good as she was in 2015.</i>

54:28.390 --> 54:31.518
<i>She was capable</i>
<i>of doing this very difficult vault.</i>

54:31.601 --> 54:34.521
<i>We'll see it from Simone Biles.</i>
<i>It's called the Amanar.</i>

54:34.604 --> 54:36.022
<i>It's a two-and-a-half twist.</i>

54:41.945 --> 54:44.489
<i>Yup, just the double full. Great landing!</i>

54:46.074 --> 54:48.743
<i>She's gonna get a very nice score,</i>
<i>but once again,</i>

54:48.827 --> 54:51.663
<i>it doesn't have</i>
<i>the same maximum level score</i>

54:51.746 --> 54:53.415
<i>that the Amanar would have.</i>

54:56.001 --> 54:58.003
[no audible dialogue]

55:03.133 --> 55:05.260
[John] You watch
and watch her do her best.

55:05.343 --> 55:07.971
And you watch her compete,
and she did well.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.476
But for us, you know, as parents,

55:13.560 --> 55:16.312
every meet that we had gone to
up until this point,

55:16.396 --> 55:17.731
we had our seats marked.

55:19.024 --> 55:21.192
You know, we had
camera crews following us.

55:21.693 --> 55:24.195
Even at the America's Cup,
a couple of weeks prior,

55:24.279 --> 55:27.449
we had a camera crew following us
throughout the whole arena.

55:29.117 --> 55:31.202
But we showed up at Olympic trials and...

55:31.828 --> 55:33.079
our seats aren't marked.

55:33.163 --> 55:37.459
We don't have mics.
There's no camera crew following us.

55:39.085 --> 55:39.919
And so...

55:40.545 --> 55:43.048
something was definitely off.

55:46.468 --> 55:48.178
[man 1]<i> So here are the final standings.</i>

55:48.261 --> 55:51.556
<i>Laurie Hernandez was the second best,</i>
<i>then Aly Raisman,</i>

55:52.098 --> 55:53.475
<i>by a significant amount.</i>

55:53.558 --> 55:55.935

55:56.019 --> 55:59.481
<i>and then Gabby Douglas finished</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:01.983

56:02.567 --> 56:04.903
<i>Okay, they took more than 18 minutes.</i>

56:05.820 --> 56:08.990

56:10.867 --> 56:13.078

56:18.041 --> 56:20.335
[crowd cheering]

56:20.418 --> 56:21.586
Good evening!

56:22.087 --> 56:25.840
It is now my great pleasure
to introduce to you

56:25.924 --> 56:30.678
the five ladies who will represent
the United States of America

56:30.762 --> 56:32.514
in Rio de Janeiro.

56:33.223 --> 56:37.894
Three-time world champion, Simone Biles!

56:37.977 --> 56:39.354
[crowd cheering]

56:39.938 --> 56:46.027
The reigning Olympic all-around champion,
Gabrielle Douglas!

56:48.321 --> 56:50.698
Making her first Olympic team...

56:51.282 --> 56:53.660
Laurie Hernandez!

56:55.829 --> 56:59.124
The reigning world champion on bars...

56:59.207 --> 57:01.543
Madison Kocian!

57:05.296 --> 57:08.049
And the second member of the Fierce Five,

57:08.133 --> 57:14.347
2012 Olympic gold medalist, Aly Raisman!

57:20.395 --> 57:23.648
They will be joined
by the three replacement athletes...

57:24.232 --> 57:27.944
[Maggie] I got sixth in the all-around,
and then five girls were chosen.

57:28.027 --> 57:30.280
And then they chose three alternates.

57:30.363 --> 57:31.823
MyKayla Skinner...

57:32.449 --> 57:36.995
Ragan Smith, and Ashton Locklear.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.665
[Maggie] I trained my whole life
to make that Olympic team,

57:40.748 --> 57:43.334
and then not making it,
even as an alternate...

57:44.043 --> 57:46.713
I was mentally and physically
just ready to move on.

57:57.182 --> 57:58.516
[John] Maggie was crushed.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.479
She had, you know, many things...

58:03.021 --> 58:03.938
taken away.

58:07.233 --> 58:08.484
And how do you accept it?

58:10.278 --> 58:15.200
You know , I'm trying to justify
and explain, rationalize things to myself.

58:18.244 --> 58:22.749
But it's hard to come up and say things
that, you know, you really can't prove.

58:26.878 --> 58:29.839
And so the girls that get selected
jump up and down

58:29.923 --> 58:32.383
and get flowers and flashes and photos.

58:33.384 --> 58:34.928
And Maggie stands down...

58:36.513 --> 58:38.640
and congratulated
every single one of them.

58:44.312 --> 58:49.067
[Gina] After being abused by USAG,
by Steve Penny, by Larry Nassar...

58:50.610 --> 58:53.988
all I wanted to do
is get my child out of there

58:54.072 --> 58:56.574
and take her home
and hug her and love her.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.756
[Maggie] I try not to...

59:12.632 --> 59:13.841
think too much about it.

59:15.051 --> 59:17.387
I just try to, you know, carry on and...

59:18.054 --> 59:21.307
hope that they made the right decision
for the right reasons.

59:32.777 --> 59:35.571
[Alesia] What are your intentions then,
going forward?

59:36.072 --> 59:39.242
I will be filing a police report
with the hope that the DA picks it up

59:39.325 --> 59:41.911
and presses charges
for first-degree sexual assault.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.665
[Alesia] How hard was it
to get to that point?

59:46.124 --> 59:49.085
I know that means,
if the DA picks it up, I'll be testifying

59:49.168 --> 59:51.546
with great detail in open court
in front of him,

59:51.629 --> 59:53.548
knowing we both have
the same memories,

59:53.631 --> 59:55.425
and I hate that idea. I hate it.

59:56.467 --> 59:58.845
But if I don't, he can continue.

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:01.973
And I hate that idea more.

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:13.318
[Alesia] By the time
I interviewed Rachael...

1:00:14.027 --> 1:00:16.029
she had about 100 pages

1:00:16.112 --> 1:00:18.489
of medical documents.

1:00:18.573 --> 1:00:20.366
She had basically prepared a case

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:22.994
against Nassar herself,
as a lawyer, really.

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:31.377
[woman] On August 25th of 2016,

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:35.423
our dispatch called and said,
"You investigate sex crimes, right?"

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:38.217
I said, "Yes." They said,
"We have a woman that called.

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:43.681
She lives out of state. And she
was sexually assaulted by a doctor...

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:48.186
sixteen years prior, and she would like
to speak to someone about it."

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:52.732
And I called her that day,
and it was Rachael Denhollander.

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:54.567
She said, "I'd like to meet you in person.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.778
I want to bring you some documents
and things."

1:00:57.904 --> 1:01:00.031
Um, I'd asked her,
"What's the doctor's name?"

1:01:00.114 --> 1:01:01.699
And she said, "Larry Nassar."

1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:06.496
I had heard of him
from a 2014 investigation

1:01:06.579 --> 1:01:08.498
where another survivor had reported

1:01:08.581 --> 1:01:11.793
that he had sexually assaulted her
during medical treatment.

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:15.380
But the case was presented
to the prosecutor's office...

1:01:16.422 --> 1:01:19.467
and they declined to...
to charge it at that time.

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:23.137
What I found out when I came forward

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:26.099
was that multiple women and young girls
had spoken up

1:01:26.182 --> 1:01:28.393
years before I walked in his door.

1:01:28.476 --> 1:01:30.186
As early as 1997.

1:01:30.269 --> 1:01:33.147
All of the women were assured
it was common medical procedure,

1:01:33.231 --> 1:01:37.026
that it was not sexual abuse, and they
were sent back to him for continued abuse.

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:42.031
-I'm sorry.
-I'm Andrea Munford.

1:01:42.115 --> 1:01:44.158
Hi. Nice to meet you. Larry Nassar.

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.160
[Munford] Thanks for coming in 
so quick, too.

1:01:46.244 --> 1:01:48.996
Obviously, you're not under arrest,
and you can leave whenever you want.

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:49.914
Um...

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:53.751
The day after I talked to Rachael,
he came in,

1:01:53.835 --> 1:01:55.670
and he was very friendly.

1:01:55.753 --> 1:01:58.965
Congenial. Quirky.
A lot of people call him quirky.

1:01:59.757 --> 1:02:02.802
[Munford]<i> </i>Now, how long
have you been doing this technique?

1:02:03.302 --> 1:02:05.263
[Nassar] I have video from...

1:02:06.597 --> 1:02:08.224
thirty pounds ago, um...

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:09.350
[laughing]

1:02:09.434 --> 1:02:11.811
From like the.. 
It would have been in the 1990s.

1:02:11.894 --> 1:02:15.148
[Munford] And I started asking him
about the 2014 investigation.

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:17.859
There were certain protocols
that were put in place

1:02:17.942 --> 1:02:20.111
about getting informed consent,

1:02:20.194 --> 1:02:23.072
having another medical person in the room,
wearing gloves.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:24.741
[Munford] Have you had any instances

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:27.618
where there hasn't been anyone in the room
for an exam?

1:02:27.702 --> 1:02:31.289
There would be some... on occasion, 
of course. You know what I mean?

1:02:31.372 --> 1:02:34.417
That just is the way medicine is now, 
it's difficult.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:38.212
[Munford] Would this ever involve,
like, digital anal penetration?

1:02:38.296 --> 1:02:41.841
Only if we're doing a coccyx,
you know, problem. I mean, then...

1:02:41.924 --> 1:02:44.177
If I...
If I actually have to fix a coccyx,

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:47.054
uh, then I would've been using
my finger inside

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:49.390
and my thumb on the outside.
You know, to--

1:02:49.474 --> 1:02:51.309
[Munford] Do you wear gloves
when you do this?

1:02:51.392 --> 1:02:55.062
If I'm gonna go in-- intra, yes.
You know what I mean?

1:02:56.063 --> 1:02:59.817
[Munford] Well, the reason I'm asking
is that we did have another complaint.

1:02:59.901 --> 1:03:01.152
-Really?
-[Munford] Yeah.

1:03:01.235 --> 1:03:03.446
And it's a patient from a while ago.

1:03:03.529 --> 1:03:05.531
-Okay.
-[Munford] And she does describe,

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:08.785
um, some things that sound to me
like they're out of the norm

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:10.661
-from your typical treatment.
-Okay.

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:17.543
And the more I<i> </i>continued asking him
about the specifics, he got very nervous.

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:19.420
He was sweating, he was stuttering.

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:21.798
And then he would try to reframe it...

1:03:22.256 --> 1:03:23.090
to blame...

1:03:23.633 --> 1:03:25.635
Rachael or any other patient.

1:03:25.718 --> 1:03:29.889
[stammering] What's confusing me-- 
to me about it is

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:32.934
why wasn't there anything said
back when I was treating them

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:35.937
if they felt that uncomfortable?
If I'm talking to the patient--

1:03:36.020 --> 1:03:39.398
[Munford] Okay, put yourself
being a teenage girl, all right?

1:03:39.482 --> 1:03:40.483
Okay.

1:03:41.108 --> 1:03:43.110
[Munford] Most people
that are sexually assaulted...

1:03:43.194 --> 1:03:44.028
Uh huh.

1:03:44.111 --> 1:03:45.988
...are very uncomfortable.
They don't know what to say.

1:03:46.072 --> 1:03:46.906
Okay.

1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:50.910
He would talk about,
uh,<i> </i>medical terminology,

1:03:51.452 --> 1:03:53.538
referencing certain parts of the body.

1:03:53.621 --> 1:03:55.998
Then he would say
"You don't need to know that,"

1:03:56.082 --> 1:03:57.792
or, "You won't understand all that."

1:03:57.875 --> 1:04:01.879
The sacrotuberous ligament...
it runs from the pubic symphysis,

1:04:01.963 --> 1:04:05.132
the falciform process--
It runs-- It's like the pelvic floor.

1:04:05.216 --> 1:04:07.552
Okay, you won't understand this stuff...

1:04:07.635 --> 1:04:09.262
So you're really coming in--

1:04:09.345 --> 1:04:12.306
[Munford] And I didn't understand
all that, but it didn't matter,

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:14.767
because he still couldn't explain to me

1:04:14.850 --> 1:04:16.477
how any of those

1:04:17.103 --> 1:04:20.857
parts or injuries to them would require...

1:04:21.732 --> 1:04:23.276
vaginal penetration...

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:25.486
to fix.

1:04:27.363 --> 1:04:29.490
[Munford] Do you ever get aroused
during these exams?

1:04:29.574 --> 1:04:31.242
Do I get aroused during the exams?

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:33.870
[Munford] Yeah, like,
do you ever get an erection?

1:04:33.953 --> 1:04:36.581
Obviously you don't,
you know what I mean, so--

1:04:36.664 --> 1:04:39.333
[Munford] Is there a reason
you would during an exam?

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:41.877
I shouldn't be getting an erection
during an exam...

1:04:41.961 --> 1:04:42.795
[Munford] Right.

1:04:43.212 --> 1:04:46.507
If there was arousal,
it's... it's... it's...

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:49.051
You know what I mean?

1:04:49.135 --> 1:04:51.888
It would be because of... whatever.

1:04:51.971 --> 1:04:53.723
I don't know, but I'm not trying to--

1:04:53.806 --> 1:04:56.851
[Munford] What is "whatever"?
I don't know. I don't know.

1:04:56.934 --> 1:04:58.978
When you're a guy,
sometimes you get an erection.

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:01.314
You know what I mean? 
But I don't-- It's... [sighs]

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:03.733
[Munford] You get an erection
when you're aroused.

1:05:04.025 --> 1:05:06.903
[Munford] And so, like last time,
there will be an investigation.

1:05:06.986 --> 1:05:08.237
-Right.
-[Munford] Okay?

1:05:08.321 --> 1:05:09.155
Okay.

1:05:09.238 --> 1:05:11.782
[Munford] I'm gonna go grab a card
so you can have my information.

1:05:11.866 --> 1:05:13.034
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1:05:20.625 --> 1:05:23.544
[Berta] As we started
looking into the Nassar case,

1:05:23.628 --> 1:05:25.504
we talked to Nassar's lawyer.

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:26.923
First thing he said was...

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:29.467
"You know, this is a very important man,

1:05:29.550 --> 1:05:32.637
and you're potentially
going to ruin his reputation here."

1:05:33.137 --> 1:05:36.015
And so we were very aware of that
ourselves.

1:05:38.434 --> 1:05:41.854
Rachael Denhollander
was just a completely credible source.

1:05:41.937 --> 1:05:42.772
Mm-hmm.

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:49.737
And John Manly and Jamie Dantzscher
were preparing a lawsuit at that time.

1:05:50.529 --> 1:05:53.282
That gave us more confidence.

1:05:56.035 --> 1:05:58.162
[Evans] We backgrounded him.
We couldn't find any lawsuits.

1:05:58.245 --> 1:06:01.082
We couldn't find
any malpractice allegations.

1:06:01.874 --> 1:06:05.795
One of my jobs was to find out
if there was an acceptable procedure

1:06:05.878 --> 1:06:08.047
where you would use
intravaginal penetration

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:09.548
to treat a young athlete,

1:06:09.632 --> 1:06:12.343
and quickly found out that there was not.

1:06:14.595 --> 1:06:18.724
My job was to contact Nassar
for an interview at his attorney's office.

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:26.273
<i>He was a volunteer?</i>
<i>Is that his status with USA Gymnastics?</i>

1:06:26.982 --> 1:06:31.445
[attorney]<i> Dr. Nassar was</i>
<i>a volunteer for how many years?</i>

1:06:31.529 --> 1:06:32.697
[Nassar]<i> Twenty-nine.</i>

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:36.492
[attorney] <i>Twenty-nine years with</i>
<i>USA Gymnastics. He wasn't paid a salary.</i>

1:06:36.909 --> 1:06:39.453
<i>Uh, he resigned-- Actually retired...</i>

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:42.540
<i>uh, in 2015...</i>

1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:45.668
<i>because, uh, he went on to other matters</i>

1:06:45.751 --> 1:06:49.672
<i>that had nothing to do</i>
<i>with allegations of sexual misconduct.</i>

1:06:51.257 --> 1:06:54.385
[Evans]<i> What else would you like to say</i>
<i>about the allegations against him?</i>

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:57.763
[attorney]<i> He denies all the allegations.</i>

1:06:58.556 --> 1:07:01.350
<i>He's never heard</i>
<i>these allegations before.</i>

1:07:01.434 --> 1:07:02.977
<i>No one from law enforcement...</i>

1:07:03.561 --> 1:07:07.022
<i>any other regulatory body,</i>
<i>USA Gymnastics...</i>

1:07:07.523 --> 1:07:09.942
<i>any individuals, parents,</i>
<i>no one has ever...</i>

1:07:10.401 --> 1:07:13.487
<i>uh, suggested that Dr. Nassar</i>
<i>has done anything</i>

1:07:13.571 --> 1:07:16.574
<i>in any context,</i>
<i>with either this gymnast or any other,</i>

1:07:16.657 --> 1:07:17.700
<i>that he's aware of.</i>

1:07:19.410 --> 1:07:21.912
[Evans]<i> And it looks like</i>
<i>there's an allegation</i>

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:27.710
<i>that he manually penetrated</i>
<i>the gymnast here, her vagina?</i>

1:07:28.294 --> 1:07:30.588
<i>Is that a procedure that he uses?</i>

1:07:30.671 --> 1:07:31.505
[attorney]<i> No.</i>

1:07:33.549 --> 1:07:36.594
<i>There's no circumstance that he ever</i>

1:07:36.677 --> 1:07:39.889
<i>penetrated her vagina in any way</i>
<i>related to any procedure.</i>

1:07:39.972 --> 1:07:40.890
[Evans] <i>Okay.</i>

1:07:45.436 --> 1:07:49.648
You know, when I left him there, Nassar
was nearly in tears, pleading with me,

1:07:49.732 --> 1:07:51.567
"Please don't write a story about this.
Don't do this.

1:07:51.650 --> 1:07:54.028
You're gonna ruin my reputation.
This is gonna harm my family.

1:07:54.111 --> 1:07:56.947
I haven't done anything wrong."
And, you know, leaving...

1:07:57.490 --> 1:07:59.742
I'm a human being, you know.
That affected me.

1:07:59.825 --> 1:08:03.245
I was confident in the information we had
and confident in our story,

1:08:03.329 --> 1:08:06.624
but I also, you know,
see this... this man who's...

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:10.920
had no spot on his record,
as far as we knew at that time, prior,

1:08:11.003 --> 1:08:12.379
begging us not to do that.

1:08:12.463 --> 1:08:16.008
I had to keep reminding myself.
I was like, "Don't feel sorry for him.

1:08:16.091 --> 1:08:18.928
Feel sorry for the victims,
the survivors." And...

1:08:19.011 --> 1:08:21.222
Um, but... but he made a...
made a good play.

1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:30.397
[man]<i> The former team doctor</i>
<i>for USA Gymnastics for 20 years</i>

1:08:30.481 --> 1:08:33.567
<i>is facing dozens of accusations</i>
<i>of sexual abuse,</i>

1:08:33.651 --> 1:08:35.736
<i>including one from a former Olympian.</i>

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:38.864
[woman]<i> The team of reporters</i>
<i>from </i>The Indianapolis Star

1:08:38.948 --> 1:08:43.536
<i>published accounts from gymnasts who</i>
<i>accused Nassar of sexually abusing them</i>

1:08:43.619 --> 1:08:45.830
<i>during supposed medical procedures.</i>

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:50.709
[Berta] In that interview
with Nassar's lawyers,

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:56.632
he said that he had never performed
an intravaginal procedure, which...

1:08:57.675 --> 1:08:59.552
was really his downfall,

1:08:59.635 --> 1:09:03.347
because, at that point,
every woman who he'd done this to,

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:04.974
and there were hundreds,

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.725
knew he was lying.

1:09:08.686 --> 1:09:12.773
And the reaction was almost immediate.

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:17.027
All these women out there were thinking,
"What?

1:09:17.111 --> 1:09:19.071
That's not what I experienced."

1:09:19.154 --> 1:09:23.075
So we started getting phone calls
from victim/survivors.

1:09:23.784 --> 1:09:26.162
[Berta] Twelve more victims
had come forward.

1:09:26.245 --> 1:09:28.163
Then it was 30, then it was 60.

1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:31.041
And it was going up every day.

1:09:31.458 --> 1:09:34.086
There were more and more and more.

1:09:34.753 --> 1:09:36.088
And as it grew...

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:40.551
we started to realize
how bad it really was out there.

1:09:42.052 --> 1:09:47.391
[Alesia] But at the time, we also got
nasty phone calls, nasty letters

1:09:47.474 --> 1:09:49.310
from Larry Nassar supporters.

1:09:49.393 --> 1:09:50.978
I mean, you have to understand,

1:09:51.478 --> 1:09:54.481
this was a beloved man.

1:09:55.733 --> 1:09:57.902
[Dantzscher] Yeah, I went in
as a Jane Doe.

1:09:58.193 --> 1:10:00.863
But, for sure,
in the gymnastics community...

1:10:01.405 --> 1:10:03.657
everyone knew it was me, and...

1:10:04.450 --> 1:10:06.118
that's kind of when

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:09.246
the shit really started hitting the fan
for me, because...

1:10:10.998 --> 1:10:12.541
people were so...

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:14.376
mean.

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:22.468
[Manly] She wasn't lauded as,
"Oh, you know, she's heroic.

1:10:22.551 --> 1:10:24.595
Good job, Jamie. Me too."

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:29.099
What she got was,
"You're a whore. You're a drunk."

1:10:29.808 --> 1:10:31.727
Lawyers for USA Gymnastics

1:10:31.810 --> 1:10:35.773
calling her ex-boyfriends, trying
to dig up dirt on her sexual history.

1:10:35.856 --> 1:10:38.776
They let her
get the living shit kicked out of her.

1:10:39.526 --> 1:10:41.820
On social media, in the press,

1:10:41.904 --> 1:10:44.573
her and Rachael Denhollander.

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.869
[Denhollander] It was
an incredibly dark time period.

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:51.580
There were a lot of things said.

1:10:51.664 --> 1:10:54.750
That I was a bitter, washed-up gymnast
who couldn't hack it,

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:56.418
that I wanted fame,

1:10:57.002 --> 1:10:57.962
that I enjoyed it.

1:11:00.005 --> 1:11:02.758
I was too physically ill to eat
most of the time,

1:11:02.841 --> 1:11:04.260
so I lost a lot of weight.

1:11:04.843 --> 1:11:08.639
I lost every shred of privacy
and, I felt like, every shred of dignity

1:11:08.722 --> 1:11:10.182
with what I had to disclose.

1:11:13.519 --> 1:11:18.399
[Alesia] He was running for school board
at the time of our first story on him.

1:11:18.983 --> 1:11:21.277
He got 22 percent of the votes.

1:11:21.944 --> 1:11:23.529
More than 2,000.

1:11:24.196 --> 1:11:25.739
After all that.

1:11:47.052 --> 1:11:48.679
[Gina] I read in <i>The IndyStar,</i>

1:11:48.762 --> 1:11:53.183
Larry Nassar was allowed
to retire from USA Gymnastics

1:11:53.267 --> 1:11:56.228
because he wanted to focus
on running for school board

1:11:56.312 --> 1:11:58.022
and his hometown practice.

1:11:59.606 --> 1:12:00.941
And I thought to myself...

1:12:01.442 --> 1:12:02.735
"What is going on here?"

1:12:02.818 --> 1:12:04.486
I mean, I was so dumbfounded.

1:12:04.570 --> 1:12:07.072
I'm like, "Why are they allowing him

1:12:07.156 --> 1:12:09.325
to go and run... even run for school board

1:12:09.408 --> 1:12:11.994
when he's been molesting my daughter
and others at the ranch?"

1:12:15.122 --> 1:12:16.373
By that time,

1:12:16.457 --> 1:12:19.793
we reported Maggie's child sexual abuse
over a year ago,

1:12:19.877 --> 1:12:22.755
and we'd been continuously told
by Steve Penny...

1:12:23.255 --> 1:12:24.548
we cannot talk about this

1:12:24.631 --> 1:12:27.509
because it'll ruin their investigation
of Larry Nassar.

1:12:28.719 --> 1:12:30.679
But nobody was helping me.

1:12:30.763 --> 1:12:33.599
I wasn't getting any guidance.
I'd had enough.

1:12:34.224 --> 1:12:37.561
So then, in <i>The IndyStar,</i>
I saw John Manly's name,

1:12:37.644 --> 1:12:39.855
and it said he had been
working with victims.

1:12:39.938 --> 1:12:41.607
And I immediately contacted him.

1:12:47.863 --> 1:12:52.034
[Manly] Within a week
of <i>The IndyStar </i>story being published,

1:12:52.117 --> 1:12:53.869
Gina Nichols e-mailed me.

1:12:53.952 --> 1:12:56.121
Didn't know who she was.
I didn't know who Maggie was.

1:12:56.205 --> 1:13:00.626
But she told me the story and told me that
her daughter had reported in June of 2015.

1:13:01.168 --> 1:13:02.211
And then I knew...

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.922
exactly who I was dealing with.

1:13:05.005 --> 1:13:09.009
I was dealing with an organization that
didn't give a rat's ass about children,

1:13:09.093 --> 1:13:13.555
that cared only about itself,
and that was covering up rape.

1:13:15.724 --> 1:13:20.020
So when Jamie, Rachael, and Jessica
reported Nassar's abuse

1:13:20.104 --> 1:13:22.523
to <i>The IndyStar </i>in 2016...

1:13:23.232 --> 1:13:25.734
that was the first time it was reported
to the public.

1:13:26.235 --> 1:13:29.696
This wasn't the first time
USAG heard about Nassar's abuse.

1:13:30.322 --> 1:13:33.867
They knew in June of 2015...

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:40.124
when Maggie Nichols tells her coach
that, "Larry Nassar's touching me funny,"

1:13:40.749 --> 1:13:43.043
who then should have reported
to the police, but she didn't.

1:13:43.127 --> 1:13:45.504
She reports it to Rhonda Faehn,

1:13:45.587 --> 1:13:47.881
who should have reported it to the police,
but she didn't,

1:13:47.965 --> 1:13:49.842
who then reports it to Steve Penny,

1:13:49.925 --> 1:13:52.761
who should have reported it to the police,
but he didn't.

1:13:53.053 --> 1:13:55.597
And their lawyers had them hire somebody

1:13:55.681 --> 1:13:58.892
who investigates sexual harassment cases
at workplaces.

1:13:59.518 --> 1:14:01.520
And she interviewed Maggie Nichols.

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:05.149
And then she interviewed
Olympians Aly Raisman...

1:14:05.691 --> 1:14:07.317
and McKayla Maroney.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:13.991
Aly Raisman reported that Dr. Nassar
had sexually abused McKayla

1:14:14.074 --> 1:14:17.828
in their residence at the Olympic Village
in London in 2012.

1:14:20.497 --> 1:14:25.794
It was five weeks
between the time Maggie reported to USAG

1:14:25.878 --> 1:14:28.839
and when Mr. Penny finally told the FBI.

1:14:29.548 --> 1:14:33.469
That's a direct violation
of Indiana and Texas law.

1:14:34.636 --> 1:14:38.140
But then, for some reason,
the FBI took no action.

1:14:39.641 --> 1:14:42.603
Nothing happened in October, in November,

1:14:42.686 --> 1:14:46.231
in December, in January, February,
March, April, May.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:49.109
All this time,
Nassar is working at Michigan State.

1:14:49.193 --> 1:14:52.863
He's molesting girls,
uh, that entire time.

1:14:53.780 --> 1:14:54.698
Thirteen months.

1:15:04.041 --> 1:15:06.418
[Berta] When the Nassar story came out,

1:15:06.501 --> 1:15:09.213
we were trying
to get on to the bigger story

1:15:09.296 --> 1:15:12.674
of what's wrong at USA Gymnastics?

1:15:13.842 --> 1:15:17.846
We wanted to establish
that it went far beyond Nassar.

1:15:18.347 --> 1:15:22.851
We knew it did because of what we
were finding out about the culture.

1:15:27.231 --> 1:15:28.857
Okay, so there are some issues

1:15:28.941 --> 1:15:30.567
-with the timeline.
-I figured.

1:15:31.276 --> 1:15:36.823
Both the laws in Texas and Indiana
require someone to report immediately.

1:15:37.407 --> 1:15:41.954
And there's somehow that there's questions
about whether USA Gymnastics,

1:15:42.037 --> 1:15:43.956
-uh... did that.
-[Kwiatkowski] Right.

1:15:44.039 --> 1:15:46.792
But what I'm hoping you guys can do

1:15:46.875 --> 1:15:51.463
is sort of go in there and actually
just write it like that, to say

1:15:51.547 --> 1:15:55.300
there's evidence that they were trying
to keep things quiet from the start

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:58.637
and then... 
then start showing that evidence.

1:16:03.767 --> 1:16:06.895
USA Gymnastics has said
that they did take action.

1:16:07.396 --> 1:16:11.650
They felt that they took action
by launching this internal investigation,

1:16:11.733 --> 1:16:14.194
hiring somebody
to look into these allegations.

1:16:14.278 --> 1:16:17.614
In doing so, interviewing people
over a five-week period

1:16:17.698 --> 1:16:19.449
before they reported to the FBI.

1:16:19.533 --> 1:16:20.784
[man] What do you think?

1:16:21.493 --> 1:16:26.081
I think that the law, as it relates
to mandatory reporting, is pretty clear

1:16:26.164 --> 1:16:28.417
that you should err
on the side of the child

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:31.169
and report allegations
to authorities immediately.

1:16:31.253 --> 1:16:32.588
That's what the law says.

1:16:36.174 --> 1:16:38.885
[Evans] As we looked deeper
into Maggie Nichols' story,

1:16:38.969 --> 1:16:44.433
we got a large dump of documents from one
of our colleagues in Lansing, Michigan.

1:16:45.017 --> 1:16:49.730
And there were hundreds of pages,
including a half dozen or so e-mails.

1:16:51.023 --> 1:16:53.900
This is a July 22, 2015 e-mail.

1:16:55.068 --> 1:16:58.947
So this was after Maggie had reported
to USA Gymnastics.

1:16:59.698 --> 1:17:00.907
Records that we reviewed

1:17:00.991 --> 1:17:04.244
showed that one e-mail
was sent to USA Gymnastics' attorney.

1:17:04.328 --> 1:17:08.624
Nassar had shared links
to some graphic videos

1:17:08.707 --> 1:17:12.127
of him performing
what he deemed were medical procedures

1:17:12.210 --> 1:17:15.714
to defend himself
from allegations of abuse.

1:17:15.797 --> 1:17:18.300
Once you find the tender point,
you can stay on it.

1:17:18.383 --> 1:17:21.637
[Evans] I think anybody that saw that
and was a reasonable person

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:24.806
and cared about kids
would have taken some action immediately.

1:17:26.141 --> 1:17:29.227
And there were other e-mails
between Nassar

1:17:29.311 --> 1:17:31.521
and a couple of USA Gymnastics officials.

1:17:32.356 --> 1:17:34.191
Pretty soon, we're fishing those out

1:17:34.274 --> 1:17:36.485
and looking at this timeline
we've created

1:17:36.568 --> 1:17:39.613
of, you know,  these lies
they were telling to cover for him.

1:17:39.696 --> 1:17:43.158
And it says, "We explained on the call,
USA Gymnastics has been made aware

1:17:43.241 --> 1:17:45.535
of concerns regarding
some of your therapy techniques

1:17:45.619 --> 1:17:48.330
and that athletes aren't comfortable
with certain areas of their body

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:49.623
that are being treated."

1:17:49.706 --> 1:17:52.376
[Kwiatkowski] "In addition, we suggest,
prior to the championships,

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:55.587
that Ron Galimore will once again
advise the medical staff,

1:17:55.670 --> 1:17:59.341
the athlete care coordinator, that you
cannot attend for personal reasons,

1:17:59.424 --> 1:18:03.220
unless you prefer a different approach
that we are prepared to discuss."

1:18:04.221 --> 1:18:06.306
All right. All right, thank you. Bye.

1:18:06.932 --> 1:18:10.727
So tell me what the--
What's the headline? What's the lede?

1:18:11.228 --> 1:18:15.732
USA Gymnastics, in negotiating, basically,
with Larry,

1:18:15.816 --> 1:18:18.443
agreed to lie to people
and say that he was sick,

1:18:18.527 --> 1:18:22.364
and that's why he couldn't go
to a particular competition.

1:18:22.447 --> 1:18:25.409
-[Berta] Mm-hmm.
-So that... I mean, that shows a cover-up.

1:18:26.910 --> 1:18:28.203
It's a pretty good story.

1:18:28.286 --> 1:18:30.664
How many co-- were copied on the e-mail?

1:18:30.747 --> 1:18:35.335
Three. It was Larry, Rybacki, and Karolyi.

1:18:36.169 --> 1:18:37.796
[Berta laughs]

1:18:42.008 --> 1:18:45.137
[woman]<i> Since the initial allegations</i>
<i>became public this month,</i>

1:18:45.220 --> 1:18:47.180
<i>the Michigan State University police</i>

1:18:47.264 --> 1:18:50.976
<i>have received two dozen complaints</i>
<i>of sexual abuse against Nassar.</i>

1:18:51.059 --> 1:18:55.063
<i>As the complaints came in this month,</i>
<i>Nassar was fired from MSU,</i>

1:18:55.147 --> 1:18:57.232
<i>but he has not been charged with a crime.</i>

1:18:58.567 --> 1:19:00.944
[Denhollander] The two biggest fears
I had coming forward was

1:19:01.027 --> 1:19:03.822
the investigator that I would get
and the prosecutor,

1:19:03.905 --> 1:19:07.451
because both of them are capable
of completely derailing the process

1:19:07.534 --> 1:19:09.870
if they don't take it seriously,
don't investigate it well,

1:19:09.953 --> 1:19:11.580
and if they choose not to file charges.

1:19:15.459 --> 1:19:17.961
[woman] John Manly
filed the civil lawsuits

1:19:18.044 --> 1:19:21.923
against Michigan State and USAG, USOC.

1:19:22.007 --> 1:19:25.218
And he represented those victims
in their civil litigation.

1:19:25.302 --> 1:19:29.014
I played the role of the lead prosecutor
in the criminal case

1:19:29.097 --> 1:19:31.808
of the <i>People of the State of Michigan</i>
<i>v. Larry Nassar</i>

1:19:31.892 --> 1:19:37.731
and, um, worked with and represented, um,
those victims in court as the prosecutor.

1:19:37.814 --> 1:19:40.984
[Denhollander] Andrea and Angela
worked very closely together.

1:19:41.067 --> 1:19:43.820
And Angela looked at the files,
and she said...

1:19:44.446 --> 1:19:47.949
"I will take them all,
and I will fight for every one of them."

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:49.576
And she did.

1:19:54.331 --> 1:19:56.500
This is a neighborhood in Holt, Michigan.

1:19:56.583 --> 1:19:59.628
It's not far from MSU's campus, um,

1:19:59.711 --> 1:20:00.837
where he lived.

1:20:02.047 --> 1:20:05.217
And we had gotten information
from some victims

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:08.470
that reported
he was doing medical treatments

1:20:08.553 --> 1:20:10.055
in the basement of his home.

1:20:10.555 --> 1:20:13.225
And, during that time,
he was sexually abusing them.

1:20:13.308 --> 1:20:17.187
Um, there was also another victim
who was not a medical patient

1:20:17.270 --> 1:20:19.439
that he had sexually abused
in the basement.

1:20:19.856 --> 1:20:21.358
And based on that information,

1:20:21.441 --> 1:20:23.985
we were able to get search warrants
for his house.

1:20:26.112 --> 1:20:29.866
We executed the search warrant
on September 20th, 2016.

1:20:33.161 --> 1:20:36.540
One of our crime scene investigators
came in midday

1:20:36.623 --> 1:20:38.667
and said,
"The trash hasn't been picked up yet.

1:20:38.750 --> 1:20:41.127
It's still out by the curb,
and all the trash is still in it."

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:43.129
So we did what's called a trash pull.

1:20:44.506 --> 1:20:47.008
Inside the trash,
there were several hard drives...

1:20:47.592 --> 1:20:51.054
with his name and phone number
written on them in Sharpie.

1:20:53.056 --> 1:20:57.060
That's where the first images
of child sexually abusive material...

1:20:57.644 --> 1:20:59.980
commonly referred to as child porn,
were found.

1:21:03.608 --> 1:21:05.652
Thirty-seven thousand images.

1:21:10.156 --> 1:21:13.827
[woman]<i> Michigan State University</i>
<i>and Team USA Gymnastics doctor,</i>

1:21:13.910 --> 1:21:16.288
<i>Larry Nassar, has been arrested.</i>

1:21:16.371 --> 1:21:20.458
<i>Nassar will be charged with three counts</i>
<i>of first-degree criminal sexual conduct</i>

1:21:20.542 --> 1:21:24.379
<i>with someone younger than 13.</i>
<i>Attorney General Bill Schuette is...</i>

1:21:24.462 --> 1:21:28.008
[Povilaitis] We were looking toward trial,
um, and preparing for that.

1:21:28.675 --> 1:21:32.053
And... and we really looked at what could
get the highest sentence for him.

1:21:32.137 --> 1:21:35.515
In Michigan, we have a statute
that, if you have a victim under 13

1:21:35.599 --> 1:21:38.310
and she's penetrated,
it's a 25-year mandatory minimum.

1:21:40.145 --> 1:21:42.731
And then we identified those cases
that we thought were strongest

1:21:42.814 --> 1:21:45.066
and brought those in February of 2017.

1:21:45.859 --> 1:21:49.905
Those victims knew to report
because of Rachael's disclosure.

1:21:50.572 --> 1:21:53.700
She, you know, at that point,
was the only public face.

1:21:54.326 --> 1:21:56.620
[man] Do you swear or affirm that the...

1:21:56.703 --> 1:22:00.123
[Munford] When a victim comes to report
a sexual assault, it's a scary thing

1:22:00.206 --> 1:22:03.960
because they're giving up so much control
by telling someone what happened to them.

1:22:04.461 --> 1:22:07.464
But each of the survivors
were very determined...

1:22:08.465 --> 1:22:10.425
to make it very clear to everybody...

1:22:11.343 --> 1:22:12.385
what really went on.

1:22:17.849 --> 1:22:20.852
[Manly] What ended up happening
is he made a plea deal...

1:22:21.645 --> 1:22:25.023
where he agreed to plead guilty
to the possession of child pornography,

1:22:25.231 --> 1:22:27.525
to willfully destroying evidence...

1:22:28.109 --> 1:22:31.071
and a couple of other charges,
in exchange for the dismissal

1:22:31.154 --> 1:22:34.407
of traveling with intent
to commit a sexual assault overseas,

1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:36.326
which is a violation of federal law.

1:22:42.916 --> 1:22:45.293
[Povilaitis] Good morning, Your Honor.
Angela Povilaitis.

1:22:45.377 --> 1:22:46.544
On behalf of the people

1:22:46.628 --> 1:22:49.047
and the Michigan Department
of Attorney General,

1:22:49.130 --> 1:22:50.382
I will let the other attorneys--

1:22:50.465 --> 1:22:53.802
We were able to lay out the terms
of the sentencing range.

1:22:54.844 --> 1:22:57.639
But we also wanted victim buy-in.
Like, we wanted them,

1:22:58.056 --> 1:23:02.644
all 125, if possible,
to be okay with this plea.

1:23:02.727 --> 1:23:06.564
So essential to any plea agreement

1:23:06.648 --> 1:23:11.236
was that he had to agree to allow
all of the victims,

1:23:11.319 --> 1:23:13.446
if they chose,
to give an impact statement.

1:23:15.031 --> 1:23:18.410
So that was something, quite frankly,
I am really proud about.

1:23:19.244 --> 1:23:22.664
If I may, our first survivor
to speak today, Your Honor,

1:23:22.747 --> 1:23:26.376
is a former, um, national team member,
and I'm very happy that she's here.

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.503
Her name is Jamie Dantzscher.

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:31.256
[judge] Thank you.
What would you like us to know?

1:23:32.215 --> 1:23:33.550
[Dantzscher clears throat]

1:23:33.633 --> 1:23:37.554
Larry, you saw all the physical, mental,
and emotional abuse

1:23:37.637 --> 1:23:40.640
from our coaches and USAG national staff.

1:23:41.891 --> 1:23:45.478
You pretended to be on my side,
calling all of them the monsters.

1:23:46.855 --> 1:23:50.942
But instead of protecting children
and reporting the abuse you saw...

1:23:51.568 --> 1:23:56.156
you used your position of power
to manipulate and abuse as well.

1:23:57.073 --> 1:23:58.992
You knew I was powerless.

1:24:02.203 --> 1:24:03.121
Mmm.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:09.544
I'm here today with all these other women,
not victims, but survivors...

1:24:10.253 --> 1:24:15.675
to tell you face-to-face
that your days of manipulation are over.

1:24:16.926 --> 1:24:18.219
We have a voice now.

1:24:18.928 --> 1:24:20.847
We have the power now.

1:24:23.516 --> 1:24:25.769
As an Olympic gymnast...

1:24:26.478 --> 1:24:29.147
being able to say...

1:24:29.856 --> 1:24:32.317
"You have no power over me anymore..."

1:24:33.610 --> 1:24:37.405
I can finally say
I am proud to be an Olympian.

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:40.658
It's been so hard to be...

1:24:41.326 --> 1:24:42.744
proud of anything.

1:24:43.870 --> 1:24:46.956
So to even say that, for me,
is like, "Okay.

1:24:47.749 --> 1:24:51.377
I think I'm getting a little better.
I feel proud of something."

1:24:52.128 --> 1:24:54.672
[Povilaitis] Judge, the first victim
will be publicly identified,

1:24:54.756 --> 1:24:56.508
and her name is Ms. Kyle Stephens.

1:24:56.591 --> 1:24:58.510
She has asked for two support persons.

1:24:58.593 --> 1:25:00.637
I will be standing in support of her.

1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:03.681
The next survivor you will hear from
is Amanda Thomashow.

1:25:03.765 --> 1:25:06.392
She has authorized
to be publicly identified.

1:25:06.893 --> 1:25:09.646
Your Honor, the next survivor
you will hear from is Larissa Boyce.

1:25:09.729 --> 1:25:12.107
She is going to be publicly identified.

1:25:12.649 --> 1:25:16.361
I told Michigan State University
back in 1997.

1:25:18.655 --> 1:25:20.198
Instead of being protected...

1:25:20.824 --> 1:25:23.576
I was humiliated, I was in trouble,

1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:26.538
and brainwashed into believing
that I was the problem.

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:32.752
Every time Angela stood up and said,
"Survivor XYZ is coming forward,

1:25:32.836 --> 1:25:34.587
and she has decided to speak publicly..."

1:25:35.255 --> 1:25:38.007
that was just an incredibly
powerful statement every single time.

1:25:38.633 --> 1:25:40.552
Because it meant that they felt
safe enough.

1:25:40.635 --> 1:25:44.222
And it meant that they were able
to put the shame not on themselves,

1:25:44.305 --> 1:25:45.348
but on their abuser.

1:25:47.517 --> 1:25:50.562
[woman]<i> Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles</i>
<i>is going public today,</i>

1:25:50.645 --> 1:25:55.191
<i>saying she was among the athletes</i>
<i>who were sexually abused by Larry Nassar.</i>

1:25:55.275 --> 1:25:57.694
[man]<i> Several Olympic champions</i>
<i>have also come forward,</i>

1:25:57.777 --> 1:26:00.864
<i>including Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney</i>
<i>and Gabby Douglas.</i>

1:26:00.947 --> 1:26:03.867
<i>Maggie Nichols first came forward</i>
<i>more than two years ago,</i>

1:26:03.950 --> 1:26:07.203
<i>but her identity has not been</i>
<i>publicly known until now.</i>

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:14.294
[Gina] Maggie did not want
to be here today.

1:26:14.377 --> 1:26:15.795
She is a full-time student,

1:26:15.879 --> 1:26:19.257
and she's training as a full-time athlete
still for the University of Oklahoma.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:21.092
So this is-- It's too painful.

1:26:21.593 --> 1:26:26.681
So I'm gonna read, um, the statement
from-- that she put out to the public.

1:26:27.432 --> 1:26:30.435
"USA Gymnastics
and the United States Olympic Committee

1:26:30.518 --> 1:26:32.812
did not provide a safe environment

1:26:32.896 --> 1:26:35.690
for me and my teammates and friends
to train.

1:26:35.773 --> 1:26:40.486
We were subjected to Dr. Larry Nassar
at every national team training camp,

1:26:40.570 --> 1:26:42.864
which occurred monthly
at the Karolyi Ranch.

1:26:43.531 --> 1:26:47.285
Up until now,
I was identified as Athlete A

1:26:47.368 --> 1:26:50.330
by USA Gymnastics,
the United States Olympic Committee,

1:26:50.413 --> 1:26:52.040
and Michigan State University.

1:26:52.123 --> 1:26:55.376
And I want everyone to know
that he did not do this to Athlete A.

1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:57.295
He did it to Maggie Nichols."

1:26:57.378 --> 1:26:59.297
Thank you so much for being here.

1:27:13.269 --> 1:27:14.604
[Munford] Watching them...

1:27:16.814 --> 1:27:18.066
support each other...

1:27:18.650 --> 1:27:21.319
and... and just that momentum
of empowerment...

1:27:22.528 --> 1:27:23.780
was incredible.

1:27:25.365 --> 1:27:27.450
I'm not gonna look at her.
She's gonna make me cry.

1:27:29.953 --> 1:27:31.537
[Povilaitis]<i> </i>I am so honored...

1:27:31.913 --> 1:27:35.416
to let you know that the next person
you will hear from

1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:36.751
is Rachael Denhollander.

1:27:36.834 --> 1:27:39.629
[cameras clicking]

1:27:42.131 --> 1:27:43.758
[Denhollander]
There are two major purposes

1:27:43.841 --> 1:27:46.052
in our criminal justice system,
Your Honor.

1:27:46.135 --> 1:27:49.764
The pursuit of justice
and the protection of the innocent.

1:27:50.473 --> 1:27:52.475
Neither of these purposes can be met

1:27:52.558 --> 1:27:55.436
if anything less
than the maximum available sentence

1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:58.314
under the plea agreement
is imposed upon Larry for his crimes.

1:27:59.732 --> 1:28:02.944
So I ask...
how much priority should be placed

1:28:03.027 --> 1:28:05.863
on communicating
that the fullest weight of the law

1:28:05.947 --> 1:28:08.199
will be used to protect
another innocent child

1:28:08.282 --> 1:28:11.452
from the soul-shattering devastation
that sexual assault brings?

1:28:12.286 --> 1:28:15.123
I submit to you
that these children are worth everything.

1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:18.710
Worth every protection the law can offer.

1:28:19.294 --> 1:28:20.920
Worth the maximum sentence.

1:28:22.088 --> 1:28:23.006
[judge] Thank you.

1:28:23.589 --> 1:28:25.591
[applause]

1:28:36.728 --> 1:28:38.146
[no audible dialogue]

1:28:50.366 --> 1:28:53.077
[Manly] It's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen as a lawyer.

1:28:53.661 --> 1:28:56.539
It's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1:29:00.043 --> 1:29:02.754
He received two 60-year sentences

1:29:02.837 --> 1:29:06.299
and, uh, you know,
the tongue-lashing of the century.

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:12.055
Now, what people don't realize is that...

1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:16.392
for almost every one of these girls,
this is their first sexual experience.

1:29:17.310 --> 1:29:22.273
And when you take the ability to love
and express love from somebody

1:29:22.357 --> 1:29:24.358
and take it away or damage it...

1:29:24.942 --> 1:29:26.944
it profoundly affects their psyche.

1:29:27.612 --> 1:29:29.572
And, at... at the end of the day...

1:29:30.114 --> 1:29:31.699
that's really what he did.

1:29:32.241 --> 1:29:35.745
[stammers] He stole that part of them.

1:29:36.496 --> 1:29:38.748
And they're all struggling to get it back.

1:29:41.042 --> 1:29:43.669
And most of them
should never have met Larry Nassar,

1:29:43.753 --> 1:29:46.631
had the people in charge of him
just done the right thing.

1:29:47.173 --> 1:29:48.841
And the piece that's missing...

1:29:49.550 --> 1:29:52.011
is the accountability
for those who knew better

1:29:52.095 --> 1:29:55.723
and... the adults who were suppose
to protect these athletes

1:29:55.807 --> 1:29:57.558
and these women and these girls.

1:29:57.642 --> 1:29:59.644
And, um, we don't have that yet.

1:30:05.691 --> 1:30:09.612
Clearly, USA Gymnastics
was not anxious to have this in public.

1:30:10.738 --> 1:30:14.033
They succeeded for a year
in keeping an absolute lid on it.

1:30:15.535 --> 1:30:18.788
And what I found out is McKayla Maroney

1:30:18.871 --> 1:30:21.249
was forced to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

1:30:22.083 --> 1:30:26.337
And I believe they required other athletes
who were victims of Dr. Nassar

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:27.547
to sign NDAs.

1:30:29.924 --> 1:30:33.511
This was a full-court press
by USA Gymnastics to keep this quiet

1:30:33.594 --> 1:30:35.096
and to minimize the damage.

1:30:37.348 --> 1:30:41.894
[man] We began this process in January
following the disgusting revelations

1:30:41.978 --> 1:30:44.981
that former USA Gymnastics
team doctor Larry Nassar...

1:30:45.481 --> 1:30:49.402
sexually abused hundreds of athletes
over the span of two decades,

1:30:50.069 --> 1:30:55.032
even well after numerous survivors
alerted authorities about his actions.

1:30:55.783 --> 1:30:58.744
As we now know,
many of our American Olympians,

1:30:58.828 --> 1:31:02.331
who stood tall in representing our nation
in the international stage,

1:31:02.415 --> 1:31:04.292
were suffering behind the scenes.

1:31:08.838 --> 1:31:12.758
[Berta] We're right in the middle
of, uh, finishing up a story

1:31:12.842 --> 1:31:16.929
that's based on e-mails
that were going back and forth

1:31:17.013 --> 1:31:21.017
between USA Gymnastics and Larry Nassar,
in which they basically--

1:31:21.100 --> 1:31:23.060
After all those women...

1:31:23.644 --> 1:31:28.107
gave their testimony in that courtroom
at his sentencing,

1:31:28.191 --> 1:31:30.318
we kept our nose to the grindstone.

1:31:30.860 --> 1:31:32.778
I mean, we were just like...

1:31:33.696 --> 1:31:35.323
going full bore.

1:31:35.907 --> 1:31:39.577
Nassar wasn't our target.
Our target was USA Gymnastics.

1:31:41.787 --> 1:31:46.459
[woman]<i> USAG struggles to restructure</i>
<i>and reinvent itself amid allegations</i>

1:31:46.542 --> 1:31:50.546
<i>it turned a blind eye and even covered up</i>
<i>rampant sexual abuse</i>

1:31:50.630 --> 1:31:52.715
<i>by former team doctor Larry Nassar.</i>

1:31:53.716 --> 1:31:56.385
[man] Um, I'll begin with the questions.

1:31:56.469 --> 1:31:58.679
And I'm gonna begin
with you, uh, Mr. Penny.

1:31:59.722 --> 1:32:01.849
Former gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar

1:32:01.933 --> 1:32:05.311
was convicted of criminal sexual conduct
with gymnasts,

1:32:05.394 --> 1:32:08.314
including members
of the USA national team.

1:32:09.523 --> 1:32:12.735
My understanding is that you were
first informed about this abuse

1:32:12.818 --> 1:32:15.071
on June 17, 2015.

1:32:15.154 --> 1:32:16.155
Is that correct?

1:32:17.615 --> 1:32:22.411
Uh, Mr. Chairman, um, with respect to you
and your question and the committee...

1:32:22.954 --> 1:32:25.039
uh, I have been instructed by my attorney

1:32:25.122 --> 1:32:28.376
to assert my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.

1:32:28.876 --> 1:32:32.630
For that reason, I must respectfully
decline to answer your question.

1:32:38.928 --> 1:32:41.430
[Kwiatkowski]
As we started doing more reporting

1:32:41.514 --> 1:32:46.644
on Steve Penny's handling
of the allegations against Larry Nassar,

1:32:46.727 --> 1:32:51.274
we started looking more closely
at his relationships with law enforcement.

1:32:53.943 --> 1:32:57.071
At the same time
the FBI was investigating Nassar,

1:32:57.697 --> 1:32:59.907
Penny was talking to him about a job.

1:33:00.449 --> 1:33:03.786
This is not the only instance in which
the relationship between USA Gymnastics

1:33:03.869 --> 1:33:06.914
and law enforcement agencies
in Indianapolis was called into question.

1:33:06.998 --> 1:33:08.249
-[Berta] Yeah.
-Okay.

1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:12.336
[reporter]<i> Penny sought to cultivate</i>
<i>a close relationship</i>

1:33:12.420 --> 1:33:16.299
<i>with federal investigators</i>
<i>to protect the image of USA Gymnastics,</i>

1:33:16.382 --> 1:33:20.177
<i>going so far as to offer a job</i>
<i>to one of the FBI agents.</i>

1:33:22.346 --> 1:33:28.102
Mr. Penny, I respect your right
to invoke your Fifth Amendment privilege.

1:33:29.186 --> 1:33:30.187
You have that right.

1:33:30.938 --> 1:33:32.690
But you also have a responsibility.

1:33:33.190 --> 1:33:35.735
You were part of an organization...

1:33:36.235 --> 1:33:41.073
that, in effect,
prioritized medals and money over...

1:33:42.533 --> 1:33:46.996
the young women and girls
who were sexually abused by...

1:33:47.913 --> 1:33:48.873
Mr. Nassar.

1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:53.002
Don't you feel you have a responsibility
to the athletes who are here today

1:33:53.085 --> 1:33:54.712
and to others around the country

1:33:55.171 --> 1:33:56.422
to be more forthcoming?

1:33:58.674 --> 1:34:01.969
Respectfully, senator,
I would like to answer your question.

1:34:02.762 --> 1:34:04.472
However, I've been instructed
by my attorney

1:34:04.555 --> 1:34:07.892
to assert my rights under
the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution--

1:34:07.975 --> 1:34:12.313
Mr. Penny, may I assume that it is
your intent to invoke that privilege,

1:34:12.396 --> 1:34:14.148
uh, in further questioning?

1:34:14.231 --> 1:34:15.066
[Penny] Yes.

1:34:15.524 --> 1:34:17.902
[Moran] Let the record reflect
that you have availed yourself

1:34:17.985 --> 1:34:19.945
of the privileges afforded
under the Fifth Amendment

1:34:20.029 --> 1:34:21.364
to the United States Constitution

1:34:21.447 --> 1:34:23.866
not to give testimony
that might incriminate you.

1:34:25.242 --> 1:34:26.744
Mr. Penny, you're excused.

1:34:35.127 --> 1:34:36.003
[woman] Shame!

1:34:39.632 --> 1:34:42.677
What would you like to say to the women
that were abused while you were silent?

1:34:46.889 --> 1:34:48.849
You have anything to say to the survivors?

1:34:58.317 --> 1:35:00.945
Okay. Go ahead and write that up.
I'm gonna ask Curly

1:35:01.028 --> 1:35:04.323
-about, uh, this photo that we've got.
-Of what?

1:35:04.865 --> 1:35:07.368
It's of him being arrested.

1:35:07.451 --> 1:35:08.953
-We got a photo of him?
-Yeah.

1:35:09.036 --> 1:35:10.746
See, there's the picture. It's...

1:35:11.706 --> 1:35:14.917
I'm worried that <i>New York Times</i>
is coming out with it.

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.795
[woman] Could we go tonight?
I mean, do we have enough?

1:35:20.047 --> 1:35:22.967
[reporter]<i> A major new arrest</i>

<i>who came home from Rio</i>
<i>with an Olympic gold medal.</i>

1:36:26.197 --> 1:36:30.868
[Maggie] After the 2016 Olympic trials,
I decided to retire from elite gymnastics

1:36:30.951 --> 1:36:33.496
and move on to NCAA gymnastics,

1:36:33.579 --> 1:36:37.041
where I had the opportunity to compete
for the University of Oklahoma.

1:36:39.585 --> 1:36:40.961
In 2017,

1:36:41.045 --> 1:36:42.755
I was the last person to go.

1:36:42.838 --> 1:36:46.342
And so I did probably the best vault
that I did the whole season.

1:36:53.224 --> 1:36:54.808
[crowd cheering]

1:36:55.643 --> 1:36:57.686
I've never experienced
anything like that before,

1:36:57.770 --> 1:37:00.606
and that was probably
one of the best moments of my life.

1:37:08.781 --> 1:37:11.492
I think that it was
a huge awakening for her,

1:37:11.575 --> 1:37:15.329
because, all of a sudden, she gets there,
they're nice to her.

1:37:15.913 --> 1:37:18.958
Gymnastics is fun.
The coaches are super good.

1:37:19.041 --> 1:37:21.669
Oh, the healthcare providers
are really, really good.

1:37:21.752 --> 1:37:24.672
It's not like it was
when she was on the elite team.

1:37:24.755 --> 1:37:26.757
[cheering]

1:37:31.428 --> 1:37:35.266
[John] Maggie took all the negatives
and aimed them into a positive and...

1:37:35.933 --> 1:37:37.059
went to Oklahoma...

1:37:37.685 --> 1:37:38.727
and gave it her all.

1:37:41.188 --> 1:37:43.440
She beat them all on every event

1:37:43.524 --> 1:37:45.943
at every meet for the entire year.

1:37:46.485 --> 1:37:48.487
[cheering]

1:37:50.114 --> 1:37:53.117
[screaming]

1:37:55.286 --> 1:37:56.662
[Maggie] When they brought
the trophy over,

1:37:56.745 --> 1:37:58.873
so I think that's kind of the moment
that was just...

1:37:59.456 --> 1:38:01.875
indescribable. It was amazing. [laughs]

1:38:03.961 --> 1:38:06.380
[indistinct chattering]

1:38:07.798 --> 1:38:11.176

1:38:14.054 --> 1:38:14.889
[boy] Yeah!

1:38:14.972 --> 1:38:16.348
[applause]

1:38:16.432 --> 1:38:18.517
[Maggie] Elite gymnastics just kind of...

1:38:19.143 --> 1:38:20.144
beat me down,

1:38:21.312 --> 1:38:24.898
but I've grown as a person and as a woman.

1:38:27.109 --> 1:38:29.069
I found a love for the sport again.

1:38:49.131 --> 1:38:52.551
[Manly] Were you ever advised
by any USAG official,

1:38:52.635 --> 1:38:55.721
in or around June of 2015,

1:38:55.804 --> 1:38:59.391
that they had received a complaint
that Dr. Nassar

1:38:59.475 --> 1:39:02.853
had molested a national team gymnast
at the ranch?

1:39:04.313 --> 1:39:05.481
Yes, I did.

1:39:05.564 --> 1:39:07.775
[Manly] And who reported that
to you, ma'am?

1:39:08.275 --> 1:39:09.234
Mr. Penny.

1:39:09.735 --> 1:39:10.569
[Manly] Okay.

1:39:11.070 --> 1:39:14.531
Mrs. Karolyi knew, in June of 2015,

1:39:14.615 --> 1:39:16.951
that Larry Nassar had abused little girls.

1:39:17.534 --> 1:39:21.330
The law in Texas required her
to immediately call the police

1:39:21.413 --> 1:39:23.624
or call Child Protective Services
and report.

1:39:24.249 --> 1:39:25.376
And she didn't.

1:39:25.876 --> 1:39:28.837
Nor did Rhonda Faehn, the head
of the women's program, nor did Mr. Penny.

1:39:29.421 --> 1:39:31.006
That deserves an investigation.

1:39:31.632 --> 1:39:32.508
Other questions?

1:39:53.946 --> 1:39:57.866
USA Gymnastics once wrote to a gymnast

1:39:57.950 --> 1:40:00.995
saying that, if she continued to complain
about her coach...

1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:03.372
she would be off the team,

1:40:03.789 --> 1:40:06.458
regardless of her performance.

1:40:06.542 --> 1:40:10.087
-And that system is still in place today.
-[Kwiatkowski] Right.

1:40:10.170 --> 1:40:12.172
[Berta] They're clinging to a process

1:40:12.256 --> 1:40:15.259
that has been used in the past
to silence dissent.

1:40:15.342 --> 1:40:16.593
That's what that says.

1:40:29.273 --> 1:40:32.276
