WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.172
Eight of hearts.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.256
Drink!

00:10.636 --> 00:11.678
Three of clubs.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.763
Drink!

00:14.181 --> 00:16.558
I forget, which cards don't we drink on?

00:16.642 --> 00:18.060
Don't worry, I took them out of the deck.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.144
Francine!

00:19.228 --> 00:20.729
Francine!

00:20.812 --> 00:22.022
Francine!

00:22.105 --> 00:23.398
Francine!

00:23.482 --> 00:26.026
Chicago Dave! That's Chicago Dave!

00:26.109 --> 00:27.402
My buddy from college!

00:27.486 --> 00:29.363
He's ascended the mountain, Francine!

00:29.446 --> 00:30.739
A real mountain?

00:30.822 --> 00:34.076
Like Mount Everlast?
Or Mount Killamandingo?

00:34.159 --> 00:37.454
What? No. He's writing movies
for Reese Witherspoon!

00:37.538 --> 00:40.457
What's the best part of writing
a movie for Reese Witherspoon?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.543
Easy. Meeting Reese Witherspoon.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.670
Obviously. I'm so embarrassed
I even asked.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.255
Dave moved to Chicago.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.174
Joined the world-famous
City Second improv troupe

00:49.258 --> 00:52.135
where he was plucked to join the cast
of Sketches and Laughing,

00:52.219 --> 00:53.887
a.k.a. S and L!

00:53.971 --> 00:56.139
And now he's writing
Reese Witherspoon movies.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.516
What's your point, Stan?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.768
My point is that man could have been me.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.520
I flipped another card!

01:03.564 --> 01:05.858
Great, I'm missing the end of the game.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.192
It's a red one!

01:07.276 --> 01:09.528
Ugh, that's a drink one, Stan.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.576
Good morning, USA

01:15.659 --> 01:19.204
I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:19.288 --> 01:22.249
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:22.332 --> 01:25.878
And he's shining a salute
To the American race

01:28.630 --> 01:31.800
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

01:31.967 --> 01:34.261
Good morning, USA

01:34.344 --> 01:35.345
Ah!

01:37.014 --> 01:39.892
Good morning, USA

01:42.477 --> 01:45.939
Chicago Dave is living
the best life a human can.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.150
And you went to college with him.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.027
I more than went to college with him.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.403
A little backstory is needed.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.487
Ugh.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.032
It was the summer of 21 years ago,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.201
the start of my senior year of college.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.495
I was ready to take the throne
as Funniest Student

02:00.579 --> 02:01.997
in the School of Government.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.084
But what I didn't know was someone else
had eyes on the same prize.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.545
What are two examples of a Republic?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.631
Uh, Disneyland and Narnia.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.967
Uh, my butt and balls.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.803
Okay, shut up, shut up!

02:16.887 --> 02:19.139
We're trying to learn government here!

02:21.183 --> 02:22.434
We became a team.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.770
By winter break we were known
more for our comedy

02:24.853 --> 02:27.064
than our schoolwork,
which we had stopped doing.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.525
...which led to rules
governing search and seizure.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.652
Seizure? I barely know her!

02:31.735 --> 02:33.904
Checks and balances?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.948
More like cheeks and ball-ances!

02:37.407 --> 02:39.743
I didn't even say checks and balances!

02:42.913 --> 02:46.667
Promise me you will never accept
any sort of government job.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.377
And do what instead?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.254
-Comedy?
-Sure.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.589
I despise comedy, so that would be great.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.633
Except for Mark Russell,
the political pianist.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.009
You guys familiar?

02:57.845 --> 02:58.971
What do you say, Stan?

02:59.054 --> 03:01.265
You wanna move to Chicago
and chase this dragon?

03:02.599 --> 03:05.936
Ross Perot,
he's an independent hero!

03:06.019 --> 03:07.771
Giant sucking sound

03:07.855 --> 03:08.897
Was a total zero!

03:10.190 --> 03:11.733
There was only one problem.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.279
I can't go. I'm too afraid.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.739
Come on, Stan. I can't go alone.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.992
I need someone to talk to on the drive.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.076
Oh, wait.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.957
Never mind! Bye!

03:27.040 --> 03:29.960
Have fun living a life of fear!

03:31.420 --> 03:33.172
He moved to Chicago without me.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.549
Never talked to him again.
Tried to get in touch,

03:35.632 --> 03:38.135
but who can touch a shooting star?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.846
You can't even touch a regular star, Stan.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.014
They're suns.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.559
If I'd just gotten in that Fiero,
I'd be a famous comedian.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.021
What? How?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.398
- You're not funny.
- Tha... bha...

03:51.481 --> 03:53.483
tha...bha... I'm a funny guy!

03:53.567 --> 03:55.152
That's what I identify as.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.821
Stan Smith. Funny. Guy.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.783
I honestly don't know
if you're joking right now.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.911
It's always so hard to tell with you.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.871
Are you being crazy right now?

04:05.954 --> 04:06.955
Kids!

04:10.542 --> 04:11.627
Not you, Klaus.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.465
Your dad just said he's a funny guy.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.428
That's a funny thing to say, Dad.
That's not like you.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.763
It wasn't a joke!

04:22.846 --> 04:23.847
Here's a joke.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.517
Have you seen these teens
eating their Tide Pods?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.810
What the heck? Those are for dishwashers.

04:28.894 --> 04:29.895
Boo.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.065
Stan, the last good joke
you made was Steve!

04:33.190 --> 04:35.859
Nice, Mom! You burned Dad and Steve.

04:35.943 --> 04:40.030
Unlike, Dad, who's had 14 years to burn me
and never once scored.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.241
Never once scored,

04:42.324 --> 04:43.659
kinda like Steve!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.577
Oh, ho! Wow!

04:45.661 --> 04:46.954
You see that, Dad?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.872
That's how you roast Steve.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.631
What the hell, Stan?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.508
I'm out. Moving to Chicago.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.884
Gonna prove the haters wrong.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.261
What about work?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.929
I told Bullock that when I was young,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.390
I dreamt of being a comedian
and how I chickened out.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.684
He instantly granted me Regret Leave,

05:08.767 --> 05:11.937
which was a surprise considering
we're basically getting ass-slammed

05:12.020 --> 05:13.272
by China round the clock.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.859
Why don't you just take an improv class
at the Learning Attic?

05:16.942 --> 05:18.694
Why would I listen to anything
you have to say?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.070
You're my number-one hater.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.780
You've never supported my comedy.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.991
Come on, is this real?

05:24.074 --> 05:25.492
How long do you plan to be gone?

05:25.576 --> 05:27.327
As long as it takes.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.871
Maybe even longer.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.626
Goodbye, Francine.
Lemme know how the kids turn out!

05:35.586 --> 05:38.463
Standing tall

05:38.547 --> 05:42.050
On the wings of my dream

05:42.342 --> 05:45.220
Rise and fall

05:45.304 --> 05:48.932
On the wings of my dream

05:49.016 --> 05:52.477
The rain and thunder
The wind and muhmuh

05:52.561 --> 05:55.147
Um buh for better days!

05:55.230 --> 05:59.234
It's my life and my dream

05:59.318 --> 06:02.738
Nothing's going to stop me now

06:12.497 --> 06:13.498
Wow.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.418
This is what I missed out on 21 years ago.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.796
-Klaus?
-Klaus!

06:21.465 --> 06:24.635
You didn't think I'd let you
move to Chi-Town solo, did you?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.387
Plus, my boy Courtney
and Tampa's cousin, Lindsey,

06:27.471 --> 06:30.557
lives down in Champaign
and has a super-tight posse.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.768
He said we can go down there
or they can come up here.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.811
It's all good, Stan.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.605
No, no. No distractions.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.690
I'm here to focus on my comedy career.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.818
Tomorrow is my first day
at City Second Improv.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.447
Don't worry, Stan.
My boys won't get in the way.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.450
We're just gonna be joshing
around, teasing each other,

06:48.534 --> 06:50.953
sharing our dreams, building our lives,

06:51.036 --> 06:54.248
and creating memories
that will last a lifetime.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.625
That's if they're willing
to drive up from Champaign,

06:56.708 --> 06:58.377
which they sounded on the fence about.

07:01.547 --> 07:05.092
I'm gonna bury you guys at improv.
I wrote so much improv,

07:05.175 --> 07:07.344
I got a joke for every location.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.972
Bar, mission control, grocery store,

07:10.055 --> 07:11.348
another mission control.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.683
Restaurant?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.893
No one's gonna say "restaurant"!
No one's gonna say that!

07:15.143 --> 07:16.979
Welcome to Improv Level One!

07:17.062 --> 07:19.147
After tonight, you'll see there's no limit

07:19.231 --> 07:21.483
to your comedy dreams
beyond the number of classes

07:21.567 --> 07:22.943
you can afford.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.778
So let's go!

07:25.988 --> 07:27.698
You must quit comedy immediately.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.658
-I'm sorry?
-You were horrible.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.702
That thing where you kept
pulling your shirt

07:31.785 --> 07:33.620
over your head and yelling incoherently?

07:33.704 --> 07:36.582
That's Turtle Man!
A very funny character of mine!

07:36.665 --> 07:39.251
Look, I'm not supposed
to discourage anyone.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.712
This theater, like every other
comedy theater in America,

07:41.795 --> 07:43.005
is a pyramid scheme.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.884
There are plenty of jobs
outside of comedy.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.261
Have you ever considered
getting a government job?

07:49.344 --> 07:51.013
Actually I work at the CIA.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.891
That's pretty funny.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.685
But that's not a joke.
I do work at the CIA.

07:56.768 --> 07:57.895
Please leave at once.

08:03.984 --> 08:04.985
What happened?

08:05.068 --> 08:08.197
My teacher kicked me out of improv class
after only eight minutes.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.991
Wow, that's fast.
But it's only your first setback.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.951
And my last. I'm quitting.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.205
But we haven't even had time
to hang with my Champaign Crew.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.875
Stan, this is Lindsey,
Double Dog, and Monty.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.835
Klaus, I don't want to meet
your disgusting friends.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.921
They all look like
Toomgis the Snack Monster.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.841
Holy crap, this dude's hilarious.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.593
You shouldn't do improv.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.304
You should be a famous stand-up comedian.

08:33.555 --> 08:34.681
I like these guys.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.517
Seem smart. Stan.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.935
Name's Stan.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.061
Stan Smith.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.482
Why aren't you guys ready?

08:43.565 --> 08:45.901
We're going on that Deep Dish Pizza Crawl.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.736
Actually we're staying in and helping

08:47.819 --> 08:49.780
-Stan with his comedy.
-Why would you want to hang out

08:49.863 --> 08:51.156
with these guys anyway, Klaus?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.783
They look like a bunch of Toomgises.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.994
You said that one before, Stan!

08:56.078 --> 08:58.080
I'm recycling some of
the classic ones, Klaus.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.164
All the greats do it.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.916
Oh, here's a new joke I thought of.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.503
Klaus got caught sneaking a thermos
into the movie theater and he cried!

09:07.130 --> 09:08.507
Good one, Stan.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.883
Classic joke structure.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.803
I'm going to, uh, go throw
a whiz in the toilet.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.931
Francine.
You gotta come get Stan.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.141
He totally crashed and burned
trying to do comedy

09:18.225 --> 09:20.185
and he's too ashamed to come home.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.145
Are you not here?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.106
What, no, I'm in Chicago!

09:24.189 --> 09:26.191
I left weeks ago, when Stan left.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.569
Huh. Now what's this?

09:28.652 --> 09:30.362
Stan's given up on comedy!

09:30.445 --> 09:33.156
He just sits on his ass all day
with these idiots,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.409
who are supposed to be
my friends, by the way.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.288
And if you ever want your husband back,
you got to come get him.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.586
So, have you been to a deli lately?

09:45.669 --> 09:47.004
All this deli meat?

09:47.087 --> 09:50.716
I mean, who needs this much deli meat?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.759
And that's how I close the show.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.434
Francine, what are you doing here?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.519
-Klaus called me and...
-Klaus?

10:02.603 --> 10:05.105
Klaus, you called Francine to come get me?

10:05.189 --> 10:06.648
What? No, no.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.193
I only called her
to tell her you were doing great.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.777
And I didn't even call her!

10:10.903 --> 10:12.946
So you haven't given up, Stan?

10:13.030 --> 10:17.492
That's great news, because I felt
terrible about not supporting you.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.620
Everybody felt terrible about that.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.246
It was a dark day.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.956
Let me make it up to you.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.833
I want to get you out there.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.169
I'll book you gigs, be your manager.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.005
Hmm. Would that be stepping
on your toes, Lindsey?

10:30.631 --> 10:33.550
Sorry, I guess my cousin
got in a car accident.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.843
What's going on, Stan?

10:34.927 --> 10:36.178
Hey, you focus on your thing.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.888
Francine's my manager now.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.224
Francine, as I become more
and more successful,

10:40.307 --> 10:42.851
your job will be getting me
roles in Pixar movies

10:42.935 --> 10:44.353
and defending me on Twitter.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.399
Surf's up, duders!

10:49.483 --> 10:51.151
Stan and Fran are gone.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.986
Time to live a little, guys!

10:53.070 --> 10:54.446
Cowabunga!

10:54.530 --> 10:56.448
I'm droppin' in!

10:56.532 --> 10:58.200
I'm gonna shoot this!

10:59.910 --> 11:01.662
I'm stayin' upstairs tonight.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.584
Now, this is what the surf
community calls hanging loose.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.089
Honestly, Roger, we're tired
from "livin' a little"

11:12.172 --> 11:13.382
with you all the time.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.009
We're burned out
on all your schemes, heists,

11:16.093 --> 11:18.887
scams, set-ups, misadventures,
and dalliances.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.806
Hmm, I'm starting to think

11:20.889 --> 11:23.392
maybe you did steal my thesaurus, Steve.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.520
It's just nice to chill
for a change, don't you think?

11:26.603 --> 11:30.065
No, what I do think is maybe
you guys need a change of scenery.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.567
And I heard there's a rager

11:31.650 --> 11:33.277
down at Chimdale Harbor.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.488
Name's Dirt Mirklegunk
and I know how to rock!

11:38.949 --> 11:40.284
No! No! Stop that.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.535
Hard pass!

11:41.618 --> 11:44.329
Ugh, that is super annoying!

11:44.413 --> 11:46.331
- You're annoying!
- You know what, Roger?

11:46.415 --> 11:49.960
Maybe you need a little break
from "livin' a little" all the time.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.795
You think so?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.380
-I don't know.
-Tell you what,

11:53.463 --> 11:57.718
why don't you let Hayley and me
host you for a chill night in?

11:57.801 --> 12:00.637
Hmm, and if that sucks,
then we can go live a little?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.014
-Maybe.
-Cool, cool.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.101
By the way, I'm changing my name
from Dirt Murkledunk to Mirt Dirkledunk.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.854
What's up with electric cars?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.731
Is everything gonna be electric?

12:10.814 --> 12:13.275
What's next? Electric slide?

12:13.358 --> 12:16.695
I prefer my slide to be gas-powered,
thank you very much.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.365
Hmm. No, that's perfect.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.409
Stan, I got you a gig!

12:22.492 --> 12:26.830
There's a show at Pizzeria Uno tonight
and they had a comedian cancel.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.083
Tonight? I'd better practice
my funny faces in the mirror!

12:31.710 --> 12:33.921
Your boy's gonna bomb, Francine.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.672
That'd be sad.

12:35.756 --> 12:39.218
Then we'd have to go home
where I get to have all the sex

12:39.301 --> 12:40.427
I want with him.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.596
And where the snacks and TV are.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.181
You want him to bomb!

12:44.264 --> 12:45.265
Yes, Klaus.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.185
You're bad, Francine.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.521
You're a bad lady.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.652
Hey! Welcome, everybody,
to Pizzeria Uno's comedy night,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.278
Take My Slice, Cheese.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.030
Okay.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.824
Our first comedian is some guy.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.868
Let's give it up for him, huh?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.622
Whoo!

13:09.122 --> 13:12.501
Please. "Some Guy" is my father's name.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.545
So, millennials,

13:15.045 --> 13:16.922
don't you just wish they were all dead?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.926
But then who would be
left to play Porkymons?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.094
Boo!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.847
Screw you, let's see you get up here!

13:24.930 --> 13:27.182
I will as soon as the ambulance arrives.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.350
Oh, no. Is something wrong?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.227
Yeah! Someone's choking...

13:30.310 --> 13:31.770
on stage!

13:31.854 --> 13:33.772
This crowd stinks!

13:33.856 --> 13:34.898
Turtle Man out!

13:38.110 --> 13:39.403
Oh, come on!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.572
He knocked over my pitchers of Blue Moon!

13:41.655 --> 13:42.990
Goddammit!

13:44.199 --> 13:45.742
Stan, are you okay?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.870
Those are the kinds of shows
that make you want

13:47.953 --> 13:49.329
to give up and move home.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.832
It's okay. You gave it your all.

13:51.915 --> 13:55.961
But I'm not going home! With your support,
I can do this for as long as it takes.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.087
Jigga-what?

13:57.171 --> 13:58.463
You see, I don't want much.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.757
I just want to ascend
the mountain of comedy

14:00.841 --> 14:03.844
and stand atop it alone,
like a hero or a god.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.848
Or something bigger than a god,
a fireball, a firehorse!

14:07.931 --> 14:10.309
Anyone who comes near me shall be burned.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.894
Is that so much to ask?

14:12.102 --> 14:13.562
I guess not.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.480
Whoo! Look out, world!

14:15.564 --> 14:16.815
Cat!

14:16.899 --> 14:18.025
Yeah, you better run!

14:18.108 --> 14:19.401
Uh-oh, Francine,

14:19.484 --> 14:21.111
looks like your support backfired.

14:21.195 --> 14:24.114
You're right. We're never going home.

14:26.575 --> 14:31.955
Smith! The Chinese are trying to kill
S and L cast member Colin Jokes.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.416
We need an agent on the inside.

14:34.499 --> 14:38.003
Please tell me you've become
a world-class comedian!

14:38.086 --> 14:39.588
S and L?

14:39.671 --> 14:41.590
That's the top of the mountain.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.175
We'd be done.

14:43.258 --> 14:44.426
He'll do it!

14:44.510 --> 14:45.802
You ready to get out of here?

14:45.886 --> 14:48.555
Stan! You got S and L!

14:48.639 --> 14:49.973
What? How?

14:50.057 --> 14:54.770
Uh, one of the busboys was a scout
and thought you were a genius.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.897
Yes! I made it to S and L!

14:56.980 --> 14:59.483
And I didn't have to deploy
my best character.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.610
Guy who talks with a crazy voice!

15:06.782 --> 15:10.035
So Stan really thinks
he's funny enough to be on S and L?

15:10.118 --> 15:13.539
Yeah, and if he finds out
otherwise, it'll destroy him.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.832
So don't say anything
about this being a mission.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.417
But shouldn't he know
the Chinese are trying

15:17.501 --> 15:18.919
to kill Colin Jokes?

15:19.002 --> 15:21.046
Stan's a CIA. agent.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.174
If anything happens,
his spy instincts will take over.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.509
Well, he better not mess this up

15:25.592 --> 15:27.970
because I want to go
to the cast afterparty.

15:28.053 --> 15:32.224
I met a girl on Bumble who claims
she's second cousins with Pete Davidson

15:32.307 --> 15:34.309
and I want to make sure she's not a liar.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.647
One extra-hot Cranberry Juice Cocktail.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.400
Aah!

15:41.483 --> 15:42.693
All right, I think I'm ready.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.069
There he is!

15:44.152 --> 15:47.823
S and L Creator and Executive Producer
Lorne Mykies!

15:47.906 --> 15:51.493
Stan, I just wanted
to personally thank you.

15:51.577 --> 15:55.163
It's good to know Colin's
going to be safe out there.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.665
He'll be safe, all right.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.001
Safe in a blanket of warm laughter.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.627
It's wild.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.754
All this just because
we made a couple jokes

16:02.838 --> 16:04.548
about the Chinese government.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.676
I've got some pretty good Chinese jokes
that aren't about the government.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.386
Don't worry, I'll only break 'em out
if we need 'em.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.265
The CIA told me you were funny.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.810
Hmm. What do you think
he meant by "the CIA

16:16.894 --> 16:18.020
"told me you were funny"?

16:18.103 --> 16:19.897
Who knows? That guy's a weirdo!

16:19.980 --> 16:23.567
All you have to do now is relax
and read the cue cards.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.653
Remember, S and L
has the funniest writers in the world.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.113
They do now that I'm here.

16:28.197 --> 16:31.366
That's why I rewrote
all the cue cards with my own punchlines.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.618
What?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.328
What pen did you use?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.288
And what end did you hold?

16:38.957 --> 16:40.792
Don't want to live a little, huh?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.794
Well, this is the other way to go.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.594
Damn, what's in this shit?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.222
Rum and Cokes! Get your rum and Cokes!

16:53.305 --> 16:54.431
I can't drink rum.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.641
Yours doesn't have rum in it.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.809
-Which one's mine?
-Any one without the "X."

16:57.893 --> 17:00.395
So it's movie night and we're stayin' in.
Love it.

17:01.563 --> 17:05.651
Tonight's entertainment
is 2017's The Beguiled,

17:05.734 --> 17:08.070
about an injured
Union soldier in the South

17:08.153 --> 17:09.988
that comes upon a school full of women.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.823
Fair warning, whenever I watch a movie,

17:11.907 --> 17:14.535
I can't resist making
hilarious little comments.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.747
Beguiled? More like buh...

17:20.749 --> 17:23.293
buh-bullshit.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.008
You can't start Week In Updates!

17:30.092 --> 17:32.469
Oh, no, it started.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.264
And I totally would have
stopped it for you.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.725
Hello. I'm Colin Jokes.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.310
And I'm Stan Smith.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.271
And this is Week In Updates.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.439
Honey! Langley Stan!

17:44.523 --> 17:46.692
My buddy from college! He's done it!

17:46.775 --> 17:48.569
He's ascended the mountain!

17:49.486 --> 17:52.114
Oh, sorry. Didn't see you'd fallen asleep.

17:52.281 --> 17:55.701
The City of Philadelphia had quite a mess
on its hands this week

17:55.784 --> 17:58.370
when 80 cows got loose on the freeway.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.456
When reached for comment,
the Mayor of Philadelphia said,

18:01.540 --> 18:02.708
"Millennials?

18:02.791 --> 18:04.626
"Don't you wish they were all dead?"

18:06.503 --> 18:09.256
But then who would eat
all the avacordo torst?

18:11.175 --> 18:12.384
Tough crowd.

18:14.178 --> 18:16.346
Oh, no, Turtle Man.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.515
Wait, look at Colin Jokes' hand.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.350
A bomb detonator!

18:20.434 --> 18:22.394
Colin Jokes isn't the target.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.729
He's the attacker!

18:23.812 --> 18:25.397
But Stan can't see!

18:25.480 --> 18:27.608
His spy instincts won't kick in!

18:27.691 --> 18:30.235
We've got to do something!

18:34.448 --> 18:35.449
They love me.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.867
Right.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.827
Spy instincts!

18:39.578 --> 18:40.579
Aah!

18:58.889 --> 19:02.434
I've heard of a comedian bombing,
but this is ridiculous.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.736
Wow, pretty good for a movie
with no dinosaurs,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.029
don't ya think?

19:14.696 --> 19:17.991
Sleepy heads countin' sheep. Don't worry.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.702
Uncle Roger'll clean up
all the cups and poison.

19:20.786 --> 19:23.330
The poison! To the hospital!

19:30.838 --> 19:33.048
Did they find the real Colin Jokes?

19:33.131 --> 19:35.384
He was tied up in his dressing room.

19:35.467 --> 19:39.763
Turns out the Chinese were only
after tonight's musical guest, Pitbull.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.349
I guess China's President
is in a legal battle

19:42.432 --> 19:45.185
with him over the title of Mr. Worldwide.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.521
I should really get on the horn
with Beijing,

19:47.604 --> 19:49.606
see if I can smooth things over.

19:49.690 --> 19:53.527
Stan, I want to thank you again
for saving the show.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.530
You got it.
Anything for the almighty laugh.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.073
And you know what the weird part is?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.950
It felt just like being on a mission.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.577
I'm normally a CIA agent.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.247
Ha-ha! That's funny. You're funny.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.875
You hear that, Francine?

20:07.958 --> 20:10.085
Lorne Mykies said I was funny.

20:10.169 --> 20:12.421
How's the view from the top
of the mountain?

20:12.504 --> 20:13.839
Majestic.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.467
But you know, the most fun I had
out there was disarming that bomb

20:17.551 --> 20:19.553
and beating that man to a pulp.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.556
Maybe it's time to go back home
and work at the CIA again.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.683
That sounds wonderful, Stan.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.268
Now let's get home.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.104
Feels like I haven't seen Toshi
and the gang in forever.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.943
What happened?

20:35.027 --> 20:36.528
Why are we in the hospital?

20:36.612 --> 20:39.156
No one knows.
Doctors aren't ruling out poison, though.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.700
And the tests all say
that's definitely what it was.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.535
Which is probably why...

20:43.619 --> 20:46.246
the boys in blue have been contacted.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.708
So I gotta mosey.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.419
The important thing?
Remember to live a little, right?

20:52.503 --> 20:54.213
Can't thumb your nose at life.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.843
Rope was too long!

20:59.927 --> 21:02.179
And not tied to anything?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.056
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
