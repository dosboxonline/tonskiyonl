WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:05.463
Can I pour you some more wine?

00:05.547 --> 00:08.174
It comes from the grape region of France.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.635
I think you'll find it pairs well
with food.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.680
Jeff, I've had cooked fish
in sauce before.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.849
But this? This is special.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.018
And served with rice!

00:18.101 --> 00:20.270
Thanks. It's my mother's recipe.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.814
She was from the old country, Florida.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.483
We thought it would be nice
to have you guys over for a dinner party.

00:25.567 --> 00:29.654
After all, you two have hosted us
for several thousand meals.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.282
We were nothing like this
when we were first newlyweds.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.450
It's true.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.161
I had to reform your mother's
party girl ways.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.871
That's not how it was.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.206
Your father was hopeless when I met him.

00:40.290 --> 00:44.252
The house had no furniture.
He used a sock for underwear.

00:44.335 --> 00:48.339
And for a napkin, he used whichever sock
he wasn't using as underwear.

00:48.423 --> 00:52.886
Well, I wasn't exactly hopeless,
young CIA agent in my prime?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.971
I was a physical specimen.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.433
Firm chest. Chestnut buttocks.
And my penis?

00:58.516 --> 01:01.978
A muscled servant ready to obey
my every command.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.773
-Dad!
-I'm sorry, Hayley, but these are facts.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.609
Francine was lucky she locked me down
when she did.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.778
That's not what you said at the time.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.655
Remember the night of
the placemats conversation?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.450
Of course. That was the night
I won the big argument.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.577
I won the argument, Stan.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.414
The sweet man I married
admitted I was right.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
We should have placemats.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.668
Please. I remember exactly
how it happened.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.920
We were in the living room.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.922
Show me. Show me exactly.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.299
Maybe that'll jog your thick memory.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.843
Was it my food?

01:33.927 --> 01:37.680
Did you have to serve your mom's
Florida Cursed Fish with Argument Sauce?

01:41.351 --> 01:44.145
Good morning, USA

01:44.229 --> 01:47.482
I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:47.565 --> 01:50.735
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:50.819 --> 01:54.364
And he's shining a salute
To the American race

01:57.158 --> 02:00.411
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:00.495 --> 02:02.372
Good morning, USA

02:02.455 --> 02:03.498
Ah!

02:05.500 --> 02:07.961
Good morning, USA

02:11.131 --> 02:14.634
This was you,
"I'm lucky to have a guy like you, Stan.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.929
"Thanks for putting up with me
even when I'm being ridiculous!"

02:18.012 --> 02:20.723
No. No! It was more like,

02:20.807 --> 02:25.311
"Francine, I've got a lot to learn,
but you're the best thing in my life,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.063
"and I just want to make you happy."

02:27.147 --> 02:28.690
That does not sound like me.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.650
I remember it exactly.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.318
You were standing right over there.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.571
You know what? There's a simple
way to settle this.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.697
Time travel.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.535
Oh, I wish I had a time machine right now,

02:40.618 --> 02:44.205
so I could fast-forward
to when we get to the CIA's time machine,

02:44.330 --> 02:46.124
and I'm proven right.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.543
Francine, it's like a nine-second drive.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.754
Can't believe Hayley and Jeff
are having a dinner party

02:51.838 --> 02:53.256
the same night as mine.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.883
You could've invited them anyway.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.385
No, they bring nothing
to the conversation.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.512
Is anyone else even coming to this party?

02:59.596 --> 03:00.889
Of course!

03:00.972 --> 03:03.308
Jurgen, Danuta, my various boys.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.268
Roger even RSVP'd "maybe."

03:05.351 --> 03:07.854
-Where is everybody?
-They're coming!

03:07.937 --> 03:09.105
They're just running late.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.899
Traffic is solid orange.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.192
Well, I'm starving.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.320
I'm digging into whatever
these fried balls are.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.655
Klaus, what is in this?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.073
Skittles.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.241
Blue package.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.332
Do you always park here?

03:27.415 --> 03:30.001
Yeah. I did it once, and it
just kind of became my thing.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.086
I got the machine.
You know, it's interesting.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.590
We've had the tech for years,
but Bullock insisted we keep refining it

03:35.673 --> 03:38.259
till it was small enough to fit
in a chimpanzee's asshole.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.553
-Why?
-That's how big he wants everything.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.264
-So, where's the machine?
-It's in my butt.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.558
Does it have to be there to work?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.769
Hmm. I guess not?

03:52.482 --> 03:53.483
Did you...

03:53.566 --> 03:54.817
Yeah, yeah. I washed it. Yeah.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.947
So, the argument happened the night
when Rachel on Friends turned 30.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.740
At least we can agree on that.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.117
Thursday nights back then,
we'd go over to Tuttle's.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.577
He's our oldest friend.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.205
We'd watch Friends, Inside Schwartz,

04:07.288 --> 04:09.832
then we'd change the channel
to watch Temptation Island

04:09.916 --> 04:13.836
until Tuttle would say he was too horny,
and the show was making him uncomfortable.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.215
Then, we'd change the channel to ER,
calm him down, and go home.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.969
Now, if we're traveling in time,
we can't let our younger selves see us.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.845
We could really mess up the time stream,

04:22.929 --> 04:24.806
create alternate futures,
that kind of thing.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.392
The president is a dinosaur,
there's no Sinbad.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.018
In that case, I would hope

04:29.102 --> 04:32.021
President Brontosaurus
would appoint a new Sinbad.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.983
So, we go upstairs,
beam to that very night,

04:35.066 --> 04:38.653
right after ER ends, wait for
our young selves to come in,

04:38.736 --> 04:40.697
watch the argument,
figure out who's right,

04:40.780 --> 04:44.033
and then jump back to the future
for the apologies and the apology cake.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.910
Apology cake?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.662
Oh, you'll be baking one.

04:47.745 --> 04:48.955
The cake can be any flavor.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.832
The point's more the humiliation.

04:50.915 --> 04:55.128
Oh, you're gonna be
the one humiliated, Stan.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.338
Fire that thing up, and let's go.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.718
Wow. Remember this?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.886
That poster was so cool.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.388
Never saw the film.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.265
Shh! I hear ourselves.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.267
Should we find a better place to hide?

05:09.350 --> 05:11.311
There's no time.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.146
Wow. I just love that show.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.273
Imagine having five friends!

05:15.356 --> 05:17.317
You have friends, Stan!

05:17.400 --> 05:19.944
I have three, Dick and Sanders. Tuttle.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.905
And, well, I also have my best friend,

05:22.989 --> 05:24.282
you, Francine.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.327
You know, I noticed Tuttle's placemats.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.412
I used to think they were just
for show-offs.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.332
Now, I see they're an important
part of crumb management.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.751
You were right, Francine.
We should buy some placemats.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.502
Aw, Stan.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.046
I already did.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.508
Hey, roomies! What are you spying on?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.387
Ahhh!

05:48.348 --> 05:49.724
Oh, right.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.851
Our roommate, Radika.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.313
She was always doing laundry
at the most inconvenient times.

05:55.396 --> 05:58.066
Could this be any worse?

06:07.658 --> 06:09.160
Let's all put our guns away.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.620
We're you from the future.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.955
We traveled in time
and did everything perfectly.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.750
Except we forgot about Radika,
the tenant who used to rent

06:15.833 --> 06:17.502
what's now Steve and Hayley's rooms.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.337
Who are Steve and Hayley?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.089
Who's this old lady?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.215
Please, honey.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.842
We look basically exactly the same.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.221
Also, that hair doesn't work for
you the way you think it does.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.931
Shoot 'em, Stan! Shoot 'em!

06:30.014 --> 06:32.475
Hang on. Hang on.
Nobody needs to shoot anybody.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.143
We time traveled here from the future,

06:34.227 --> 06:36.854
using CIA technology,
to settle an argument.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.191
Francine, I'd die to protect you,
but this guy's story checks out.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.236
Radika, all this is kind of
an American thing you wouldn't understand.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.654
I'm from Ohio!

06:44.737 --> 06:45.947
Do I need to kill Radika?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.448
No, no. It's okay.

06:47.532 --> 06:51.869
Radika, does this honestly seem like
something you want to be involved with?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.289
Bye, Radika!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.542
You know, I always had
a little thing for Radika.

06:58.126 --> 07:02.380
So, you two came back in time
to settle an argument?

07:02.463 --> 07:06.092
And great news, I,
and therefore you, were right!

07:06.175 --> 07:07.468
Of course we were.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.220
We're friggin' Francine.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.597
Maybe you were right on
the details and the facts,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.350
but bigger picture,
I couldn't be more right.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.853
Look at this fine chunk of man-flesh.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.230
You were lucky to lock
this down, Francine.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.481
Uh, 'scuse me?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.191
This ain't exactly nothin'!

07:22.275 --> 07:25.069
Yeah, show her, Francine!

07:25.153 --> 07:28.781
Stan, look at that fine ass and apologize.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.158
You want me to look at it?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.909
At least enough to be polite.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.619
As long as you guys are here,

07:33.703 --> 07:36.831
shall we rip a pitcher
of Franny's Crazy 'Ritas?

07:36.914 --> 07:40.418
They're called "crazy" 'cause
I put so much alcohol and pills in 'em.

07:40.501 --> 07:46.048
Girl, I was you, I remember you,
and I love you.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.135
Feel how firm this couch is!

07:49.218 --> 07:50.803
You need to savor this.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.264
Over the years, it gets kind of
old and worked in.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.017
A lot of things get kind of old
and worked in.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.977
Excuse me?

07:58.060 --> 07:59.437
You know what, Stan?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.105
As long as I'm back here,

08:01.189 --> 08:03.858
I'm gonna go to Buckaroo's Pizza
one last time.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.360
Appreciate that place.
It's about to close.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.654
Oh, no! What happens to Martino?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
if I know.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.659
When I get back, Stan,
I hope you're ready to apologize.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.744
Me, too.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.621
Dude, you're not gonna
accompany your lady?

08:16.704 --> 08:20.458
Nah. I'm gonna sit here and enjoy
the former firmness of the couch,

08:20.541 --> 08:22.668
then maybe play
some Jurassic Park pinball.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.545
Great game. Never saw the movie.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.218
Roger, Klaus is losing it.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.802
No one's coming to his party.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.221
I'm paralyzed!

08:33.304 --> 08:35.973
Because he's Klaus, I know
no one else will show up.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.226
So that means I don't have
to come in a persona.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.560
I can come as myself.

08:39.644 --> 08:43.356
But who is that, Steve?
What does that mean?

08:43.439 --> 08:44.899
I don't know how Roger dresses.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.317
I don't know how Roger acts.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.278
I... I don't know Roger!

08:52.448 --> 08:53.908
Roger. Roger.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.201
We can do this.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.911
Because you know who this is?

08:57.453 --> 09:00.206
This vulnerable guy I'm talking to?

09:00.289 --> 09:02.124
That's Roger.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.377
Roger's bald?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.715
So, I don't know if you're allowed,

09:09.799 --> 09:12.301
but can you tell me anything
about the future?

09:12.969 --> 09:16.472
Oh, you've got lots of stuff
to look forward to.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.726
We go to Korea to investigate rumors
of a reinvented Noah's Ark.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.145
You bring James Garfield back to life.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.022
You become a horse briefly.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.066
There's a salt mine in our backyard.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.901
Do... Do we have any kids?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.319
Oh, yeah!

09:30.403 --> 09:32.572
We also have a talking fish named Klaus,

09:32.655 --> 09:35.283
and an alien named Roger lives with us.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.743
There's a koala named Reginald
for a while.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.453
Forget what happens to him.

09:39.537 --> 09:43.833
And then, there's Rogu,
who kind of came off of Roger.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.377
So, Rogu is Roger's baby?

09:46.460 --> 09:50.423
Not in the traditional sense,
but he does breastfeed him.

09:53.676 --> 09:58.264
So, I gotta say, I'm kind of
liking the sloppy,

09:58.347 --> 10:00.641
older thing you got going on, Old Stan.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.977
-Oh, yeah?
-There's no term for this,

10:03.060 --> 10:06.939
but I've always been into
the bods of dads.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.400
-"Dad bod."
-Oh, my God, that's so funny.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.360
You're so funny.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.779
You are a dad, aren't you?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.990
Did you knock me up, Stan?

10:16.073 --> 10:17.241
I sure did.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.451
We have a daughter, Hayley, and...

10:18.534 --> 10:19.869
Don't tell me their names.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.412
I don't wanna hear the names.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.790
Just tell me you knocked me up real good.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.542
Maybe you shouldn't get so close.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.086
Old Francine's already pretty mad at me.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.672
She'll be even madder if she heard me
call her "Old Francine."

10:31.756 --> 10:34.508
That better be our little secret, then.

10:34.592 --> 10:37.511
Maybe we should have other secrets.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.473
We could even get Radika in the mix,

10:40.556 --> 10:43.267
fully clothed and completely off-limits
to you, of course,

10:43.351 --> 10:45.603
but she'd be in the mix.

10:46.979 --> 10:51.150
Francine, I know all I ever talk about
is how I'm gonna kill Osama bin Laden,

10:51.233 --> 10:53.444
but I'm also full of a lot of love.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.156
And just as much as I want
to kill him, I love you.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.826
Whatever I did that you're mad
at me about in the future,

11:00.910 --> 11:02.453
I apologize.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.413
You were right, and I'm sorry.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.540
You're gonna have a great life.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.501
Enjoy every second of it.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.336
Is that Radika?

11:10.419 --> 11:12.213
Get in here, girl!

11:13.381 --> 11:14.632
-What the...
-Ahhh!

11:14.715 --> 11:16.175
I should've known!

11:16.258 --> 11:17.259
You!

11:17.343 --> 11:19.887
How could I not see that coming?

11:19.970 --> 11:23.057
You pulled a classic separation move
on me!

11:23.140 --> 11:26.185
I taught us that, to use against others!

11:26.268 --> 11:28.020
We never made that deal!

11:28.104 --> 11:29.397
Share your man!

11:29.480 --> 11:31.732
Are... Are you mad about this, me?

11:31.816 --> 11:32.817
Not really.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.278
I mean, if you're me, then I'm about
to have sex for the eighth time!

11:36.362 --> 11:38.489
That's a healthy attitude.

11:38.572 --> 11:43.160
Wanna come over here and give me
a double extra good-time, Stanning?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.955
See if you can make your wangs
meet in the middle.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.332
Staniel, may I see you in the kitchen?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.501
- Which one of...
- You!

11:51.419 --> 11:52.920
I can't believe you.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.881
Cheating on me the first
second you get a chance?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.675
Yeah, but cheating on you with you.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.051
That's romantic.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.136
I have an idea.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.889
What if both Francines cool off
with a hot steamy shower...

12:03.973 --> 12:07.184
You know what?
If you love the past so much,

12:07.268 --> 12:10.062
you can stay here until
you've learned your lesson.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.941
Why don't you keep him if you
want him so much, young me?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.484
I'm going back to the present.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.652
Wait, Francine.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.155
You can't leave two Stans
here in one timeline.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.323
What if we kiss, and can't stop kissing?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.993
Fine. I'm taking the Stan I like better.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.786
Goodbye, Stan.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.707
Okay. All right. No problem.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.168
I still have you in your prime.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.419
Now, where were we?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.756
Actually, some of the stuff
old me was saying

12:36.839 --> 12:38.048
sounded kind of bad.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.592
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.553
-She's me!
-I... I meant crazy in a cool way.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.930
Cool Runnings. Is that from now?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.559
I'd be pretty mad if you slept
with 20-years-ago me.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.228
-She'd be eight.
-Exactly, you perv!

12:51.312 --> 12:54.482
I'm gonna crash at Trish's
until I find my own place.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.150
Good luck, Stan.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.404
Santa? Oh.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.328
Mr. and Mrs. S.

13:07.411 --> 13:11.916
You decided to return for hookah, figs,
and apricot brandy.

13:11.999 --> 13:16.128
Hayley, your father and I
went back in time to settle our argument,

13:16.212 --> 13:18.964
but then, your dad acted like a jackass,

13:19.048 --> 13:22.051
so I left him back there
and gave myself an upgrade.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.637
Meet your new dad, Young Dad.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.764
-Whoa.
-Hi.

13:26.847 --> 13:27.932
You're my daughter?

13:28.015 --> 13:29.975
You messed with the time stream?

13:30.100 --> 13:32.228
I feel myself fading away!

13:32.311 --> 13:34.355
Jeff, that doesn't make sense.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.190
Dad's not your dad.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.651
But how come I still exist?

13:38.734 --> 13:40.778
You're already conceived,
somewhere back there.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.029
In that case, I'm good.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.614
Nice to meet you, Young Dad.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.949
What's your favorite band?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.243
Tie, Evanescence and Wheatus.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
We're gonna be all right.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.997
Now, because we did mess up time,

13:52.081 --> 13:54.625
I'm not sure if Steve will still be here,

13:54.708 --> 13:59.255
which means you'll have to be the one
who remembers the Wi-Fi password.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.548
Steve!

14:00.631 --> 14:02.800
This is a young version of your dad.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.343
He'll be your new father.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.512
Wait. Does this mean I won't exist?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.639
Either we'll eventually conceive you,

14:08.722 --> 14:12.601
or you'll start to fade away
into non-existence as time changes.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.563
Well, at least that would get me
out of Klaus' dinner party.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.648
-Who's Klaus again?
-Don't worry about Klaus.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.732
Klaus is nobody.

14:18.858 --> 14:23.779
Well, Young Dad, allow me
to introduce you to Roger.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.990
Hi. I'm Roger.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.741
Stan, you're gonna meet me in Utah

14:27.825 --> 14:30.578
about 12 years ago, my past, your future.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.122
We made a beautiful sound together.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.667
Was that a space alien?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.752
Who could that be?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.679
Oh, hey, Radika.

14:48.762 --> 14:49.930
Sorry it's a little messy in here.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.892
I'm just going hog
on the bachelor lifestyle.

14:52.975 --> 14:57.730
So, it's looking like Francine's
not coming back, huh?

14:57.813 --> 14:59.815
What's it been, like, two months?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.275
Two months, six days.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.610
Yeah, don't think she's coming.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.194
But it's cool. I'm enjoying

15:04.278 --> 15:05.279
all this.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.406
Plus, I'm about to win big gambling.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.659
I know the Cincinnati Bagels
win the Super Bowl one of these years.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.745
-The Bengals?
-Yeah, maybe.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.331
Well, I'm sure you'll find someone else.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.082
You're a catch, Stan.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.544
Thanks. But it's just so hard
to meet new people, Radika.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.254
You're telling me.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.883
Flips it downfield!

15:25.966 --> 15:27.426
Knocked away!

15:36.060 --> 15:39.897
Somewhere inside me, I think
I always knew this was right.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.523
Me too, Stan.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.109
There's so much I love about you.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.321
And the things I don't love
I know I can fix.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.573
Because you don't need placemats!

15:49.657 --> 15:51.408
Why would we have something we don't need?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.577
Why did I think this was a good idea?

15:53.661 --> 15:55.204
My mother warned me.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.040
Why did I marry an old CIA agent

15:58.123 --> 15:59.792
who spent all of our savings

15:59.875 --> 16:03.087
betting on the Cincinnati Bengals
to win the Super Bowl?

16:03.170 --> 16:05.255
They win one of these years, I swear!

16:05.339 --> 16:08.050
I remember tears of joy
on Carson Palmer's face!

16:08.133 --> 16:09.677
He was kissing his little boy.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.929
This isn't working out, Stan.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.430
-Fine.
-Fine!

16:14.556 --> 16:17.434
Maybe I messed up
when I lost Francine.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.479
Maybe she was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.189
No, no, no. I'm fine.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.400
I'm still a cool single guy!

16:24.483 --> 16:27.528
You know, I always regretted
never doing a year as a ski bum.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.154
Maybe I'll try that.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.157
So, are you interested
in buying this one, or...

16:32.241 --> 16:33.617
Nah. Motorcycles aren't for me.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.035
Way too dangerous.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.414
Cool. You're all set.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.665
Have a great day on the mountain.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.625
Gustin. Marlowe. Gustin!

16:41.709 --> 16:44.712
I didn't buy you two $400
Helly Hansen jackets

16:44.795 --> 16:45.963
so you could just sit in the lodge.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.256
-Let's move.
-Roger?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.841
Hmm? You're confused.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.177
I'm Dr. Steele Birchington,
Houston cardiac surgeon.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.388
I've put in over 600 stents.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.182
Gustin! Gustin, stay in line.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.309
No, Roger, it's me, Stan.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.604
You don't know me yet,
or maybe we never met, but...

17:02.688 --> 17:04.273
God, it's so good to see a friend!

17:04.356 --> 17:05.566
What're you talking about?

17:05.649 --> 17:07.234
You know what?
What'd you say your name is?

17:07.317 --> 17:08.861
Stan? I'm ready for a change.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.363
What's your thing, old man?
You're too old to be a ski bum.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.158
Yeah, I was thinking about
starting a coffee shop.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.409
Maybe learn guitar.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.869
I'm in. Goodbye, kids.

17:16.952 --> 17:20.164
Tell your mother I was sleeping with Paolo
from photography class.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.632
Gonna take some time
To do the things

17:30.716 --> 17:35.429
We never had!

17:40.434 --> 17:42.478
Stan, we're locking in on a sound, here.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.855
We could be a credible Toto cover band.

17:44.938 --> 17:45.981
No.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.357
No. This isn't right.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.652
We're sounding better than ever,
but nothing feels right.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.696
I blew it when I lost Francine.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.199
What're you talking about?
You've got Amanda now.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.578
It's not the same.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.829
I've been going through life

18:00.913 --> 18:03.248
with nothing to keep me company
but regret.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.334
Uh, okay.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.753
Is there any way to fix my life?

18:09.338 --> 18:12.049
And so, I waited until now, Francine.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.426
Life was so dreary without you.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.138
Sure, I got to witness the 2008 Olympic
opening ceremonies again.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.474
Incredible, Francine, the precision.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.351
But it wasn't worth it.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.186
Life without you was hollow.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.063
I had years to think on it.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.274
I realized that, maybe,
just maybe, if I could wait

18:29.358 --> 18:32.069
until tonight, the very night
when we went back in time

18:32.152 --> 18:33.654
because of my stupid pride,

18:33.737 --> 18:36.490
maybe there'd be a chance
to salvage some of my life.

18:36.573 --> 18:40.119
So, you relived the last 20 years?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.621
Not quite. Young Francine left me.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.790
-She married Principal Lewis.
-Ooh, nice.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.000
And she had this great group
of girlfriends, too.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.711
If one of them needed something,
the other ones were, like, always there.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.630
They were, like, closer than sisters.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.508
There was some drama when Lillian was
getting married again, and it was like,

18:54.591 --> 18:56.218
"Does she deserve
a second bachelorette..."

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
-No!
-What's happening?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.056
I heard something, so I started shooting.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.933
That's you!

19:03.392 --> 19:07.896
This beautiful, special woman
is yours now, Young Stan.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.524
Don't make the mistake I did.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.651
Don't live your life full of regret.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.989
Oh, Stan!

19:17.072 --> 19:19.158
No. No. This isn't right.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.827
We can't let this happen
to this pathetic old man.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.037
Where are we going?

19:24.121 --> 19:25.706
Back in time.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.083
Guests!

19:28.167 --> 19:30.210
People came!

19:30.294 --> 19:32.129
And look at you, Roger.

19:32.212 --> 19:35.257
What outrageous persona
are you presenting?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.552
Klaus, I'd like you to meet Roger.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.636
Hi. I'm Roger.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.430
I like baseball and musicals.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.475
Nice to meet you, Roger.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.895
I'm so sorry we're late, Klaus.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.605
Traffic was solid orange.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.191
I can't believe this. People came!

19:52.274 --> 19:57.112
Everyone, I'd like to introduce you
to someone. This is...

19:57.196 --> 20:00.824
Demetrius Fitzpatio,
chiropractor to the stars!

20:03.535 --> 20:04.995
Who am I?

20:06.955 --> 20:11.001
Oh, I wish I had a time machine right now,

20:11.084 --> 20:14.880
so I could fast-forward to when
we get to the CIA's time machine,

20:14.963 --> 20:16.965
and I'm proven right.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.092
Francine, it's like a nine-second drive.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
-Ahhh!
-Looking for this?

20:22.346 --> 20:23.597
Don't do it, Stan.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.015
Let go of your pride.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.017
It's not worth losing Francine over.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.186
Don't worry, sweetie. I'm you.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.896
We're doing great.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.397
You win the argument.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.067
Appreciate what you have, Stan.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.197
Do you know what that was about?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.032
No. But you know what?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.117
Maybe we don't go back in time.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.452
I'm sure you were right.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.038
Whatever happened in the past,
it brought us here.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.373
That's right.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.250
And it's pretty nice, isn't it?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.751
It's beautiful.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.587
Did you know Klaus was also
having a dinner party tonight?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.422
Mother didn't invite us!

20:57.506 --> 20:58.715
We could go back and ruin it.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.259
Beats Jeff's figs.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.219
That's not dessert.
