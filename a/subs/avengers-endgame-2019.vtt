00:05.440 --> 00:08.080
BARTON: Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.920
-You see where you're going?
-Mm-hmm.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.080
Okay.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.160
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.440
Gotta move your foot here.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.360
Point your toe this way.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.280
Your hips here.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.800
Okay?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.080
-Can you see?
-Yeah.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.240
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.640
How about now?
Can you see now?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.080
No.
-How about now?

00:30.240 --> 00:31.320
All right.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.920
Ready? Three fingers.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.800
COOPER: Nice!

00:37.360 --> 00:38.960
LAURA: Nice throw, kiddo.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.200
COOPER: Here you go.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.720
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

00:42.800 --> 00:44.240
Or both?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.520
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

00:46.680 --> 00:47.720
Probably your brothers.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.880
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
LAURA: Got it!

00:51.440 --> 00:52.960
Nate, mayo or mustard?

00:53.680 --> 00:54.880
How about ketchup?

00:55.320 --> 00:57.280
LAURA: Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.640
BARTON: Mind your elbow.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.680
Good job, hawk-eye.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
LAURA: Hey, guys!

01:08.880 --> 01:11.080
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

01:11.240 --> 01:12.280
BARTON: All right.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.760
We're coming. We're hungry.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.360
Lila, let's go.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.680
Lila?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
Honey?

01:28.480 --> 01:29.560
Hey, babe?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.440
-Babe?

01:42.480 --> 01:43.760
Babe?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.600
Boys!

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
Boys!

01:51.680 --> 01:52.800
Laura!

02:35.440 --> 02:36.720
-

02:36.800 --> 02:37.880
You don't need to do that.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.080
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.360
-Oh, yeah.
-

02:43.600 --> 02:45.440
-That was close.
-

02:46.440 --> 02:48.200
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.760
I would like to try again.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.480
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

02:54.640 --> 02:56.160
It's fun.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.360
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.600
And you've won.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.840
Congratulations.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.160
Fair game.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.840
Good sport.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.240
You have fun?

03:11.080 --> 03:13.000
It was fun.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.760
-

03:35.600 --> 03:37.120
This thing on?

03:39.280 --> 03:41.320
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.360
If you find this recording...

03:45.520 --> 03:48.280
don't post it on social media.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.080
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.160
I don't know if
you're ever gonna see these.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.360
I don't even know
if you're still...

03:55.920 --> 03:57.760
Oh, God, I hope so.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.880
Today's day 21.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.280
No, uh, 22.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.480
You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...

04:06.640 --> 04:08.840
of staring into
the literal void of space,

04:08.920 --> 04:11.120
I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.720
Infection's run its course,

04:12.800 --> 04:14.320
thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.520
Oh, you'd love her.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.080
Very practical.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.640
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.800
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

04:27.880 --> 04:30.080
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

04:30.240 --> 04:32.960
and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.080
Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.760
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.600
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...

04:47.120 --> 04:48.800
and that'll be it.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.160
Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...

04:55.320 --> 04:57.040
but I gotta say
I was really hoping

04:57.120 --> 04:58.920
to pull off one last one.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.040
But it looks like...

05:01.200 --> 05:03.000
Well, you know
what it looks like.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.280
Don't feel bad about this.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.240
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

05:09.960 --> 05:13.120
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

05:18.240 --> 05:20.240
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.280
Go rest my eyes.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.840
Please know...

05:28.040 --> 05:31.600
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.800
I'm fine. Totally fine.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.760
I dream about you.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.920
Because it's always you.

09:02.680 --> 09:03.680
Couldn't stop him.

09:03.840 --> 09:04.840
Neither could I.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.160
Hang on.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.160
I lost the kid.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.320
Tony, we lost.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.600
Is, uh...?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.240
-Oh, good.
-Oh, my God!

09:27.680 --> 09:29.400
It's okay.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.120
RHODES: It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.920
NATASHA: World governments
are in pieces.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.880
The parts
that are still working...

09:45.360 --> 09:48.880
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

09:51.640 --> 09:53.200
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.480
Thanos wiped out...

09:56.960 --> 10:00.040
...50% of
all living creatures.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.320
Where is he now? Where?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.200
We don't know.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.440
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.120
What's wrong with him?

10:16.200 --> 10:18.160
ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.680
He thinks he failed.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.200
Which, of course, he did...

10:22.280 --> 10:24.400
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.000
Honestly,
until this exact second

10:26.080 --> 10:27.200
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.800
Maybe I am.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.320
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.440
Deep space scans...

10:32.680 --> 10:34.640
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.440
Tony, you fought him.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.520
Who told you that?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.240
I didn't fight him.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.040
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

10:42.160 --> 10:43.320
while the Bleecker Street
magician

10:43.400 --> 10:44.640
gave away the store.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.720
That's what happened.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.160
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.920
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.440
I saw this coming
a few years back.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.240
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.200
Thought I was dreaming.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.360
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.280
And I needed you.

11:01.440 --> 11:02.480
As in, past tense.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.920
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.200
Sorry.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.880
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.960
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

11:14.040 --> 11:15.160
Tony, Tony!

11:15.240 --> 11:18.640
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

11:18.720 --> 11:20.600
was a suit of armor
around the world.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.680
Remember that?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.440
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.720
That's what we needed.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.960
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.560
I said we'd lose.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.880
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

11:31.440 --> 11:32.520
And guess what, Cap?

11:32.680 --> 11:34.000
We lost.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.440
And you weren't there.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.200
But that's what we do, right?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.200
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

11:41.280 --> 11:43.320
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
-Okay.
-Right?

11:44.480 --> 11:45.760
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.000
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.560
-She's great by the way.
-Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.320
TONY: We need you.
You're new blood.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.320
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.720
I got no coordinates...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.640
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.520
Zero. Zip. Nada.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.440
No trust, liar.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.240
Here, take this.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.520
You find him,
you put that on...

12:10.000 --> 12:11.520
you hide.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.520
-STEVE: Tony!
-I'm fine.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.400
Let me...

12:22.920 --> 12:24.200
RHODES: Bruce gave him
a sedative.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.080
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.640
CAROL: You guys
take care of him...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.320
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
Where are you going?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.760
To kill Thanos.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.000
NATASHA: Hey.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.200
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

12:40.400 --> 12:42.040
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.640
We realize up there
is more your territory,

12:44.720 --> 12:45.800
but this is our fight, too.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.120
You even know where he is?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.480
I know people who might.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.960
NEBULA: Don't bother.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.680
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.200
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.880
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.120
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.720
I'd ask...

13:08.240 --> 13:10.920
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
And his answer
was always the same.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
"To the Garden."

13:19.280 --> 13:22.000
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.720
So, where is he?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.120
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

13:28.400 --> 13:30.200
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.560
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.080
Until two days ago...

13:35.880 --> 13:37.480
on this planet.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.680
Thanos is there.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.120
He used the stones again.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.120
BANNER: Hey, hey, hey.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.160
We'd be going in shorthanded,
you know?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.800
RHODES: Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

13:48.880 --> 13:50.400
So, let's get 'em.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.040
Use them
to bring everyone back.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.280
BANNER: Just like that?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.960
Yeah. Just like that.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.280
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

13:58.480 --> 14:01.160
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.960
If we do this, how do we know

14:03.040 --> 14:05.320
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

14:05.480 --> 14:07.080
Because before
you didn't have me.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.120
Hey, new girl?

14:09.320 --> 14:12.000
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.800
And if you don't mind
my asking,

14:13.880 --> 14:15.040
where the hell have you been
all this time?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.400
There are a lot of
other planets in the universe.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.440
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.160
I like this one.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.200
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.960
Okay.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.760
Who here hasn't been to space?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.320
-Why?
-

15:17.400 --> 15:19.080
You better not throw up
on my ship.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.560
Approaching jump in three...

15:20.960 --> 15:22.800
two, one.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.080
I'll head down for recon.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.800
This is gonna work, Steve.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.760
I know it will.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.880
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.960
No satellites.
No ships. No armies.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.640
No ground defenses
of any kind.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.400
It's just him.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.760
And that's enough.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.040
Oh, no.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.240
Where are they?

17:59.480 --> 18:01.240
-Answer the question.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.120
The universe
required correction.

18:06.280 --> 18:10.080
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

18:10.240 --> 18:11.880
beyond temptation.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.000
You murdered trillions!

18:14.960 --> 18:17.280
-You should be grateful.
-

18:20.760 --> 18:22.680
Where are the stones?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.240
Gone.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.480
Reduced to atoms.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.640
You used them two days ago!

18:27.800 --> 18:31.040
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.400
It nearly killed me.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.560
But the work is done.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.680
It always will be.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.640
I am inevitable.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.280
We have to tear this place
apart. He has to be lying!

18:49.440 --> 18:50.680
NEBULA: My father
is many things.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.640
A liar is not one of them.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.840
Ah.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.960
Thank you, daughter.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.760
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.280
BANNER: What?

19:11.960 --> 19:13.680
What did you do?

19:15.240 --> 19:17.040
I went for the head.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.120
MAN: So...

20:31.440 --> 20:33.920
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.720
It's the first time
in five years.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.240
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.440
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.000
What did you talk about?

20:44.480 --> 20:47.840
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.080
My job, his job.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.960
How much we miss the Mets.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.920
And then things got quiet...

20:59.120 --> 21:02.640
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.320
What about you?

21:05.400 --> 21:08.640
I cried just before dessert.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.520
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

21:15.200 --> 21:16.440
That's great.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.280
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.480
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.000
And that's it.
That's those little

21:23.080 --> 21:25.400
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

21:25.560 --> 21:29.280
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.680
I went in the ice in '45,

21:32.760 --> 21:35.120
right after I met
the love of my life.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.760
Woke up 70 years later.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.920
You gotta move on.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.280
Gotta move on.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.520
The world is in our hands.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.760
It's left to us, guys.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.160
And we gotta do
something with it.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.280
Otherwise...

22:02.560 --> 22:04.920
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.160
What the hell?

23:20.440 --> 23:21.800
Hope?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Kid!

23:56.200 --> 23:57.240
Hey, kid!

24:01.560 --> 24:03.760
What the hell happened here?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.240
Oh, my God!

24:40.080 --> 24:41.520
Oh, please!

24:41.680 --> 24:43.240
Please, please!

24:43.400 --> 24:45.400
No, no, no. No.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.240
No.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
Excuse me. Sorry.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.040
Oh, Cassie, no.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.640
No, no, no.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.760
No, no.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.600
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.960
What?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.360
Cassie?

25:42.560 --> 25:43.920
Dad?

26:09.960 --> 26:12.360
-You're so big!
-

26:25.680 --> 26:26.960
Yeah. We boarded

26:27.040 --> 26:30.160
that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.040
It was an infectious
garbage scow.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.680
So, thanks for the hot tip.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.160
Well, you were closer.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.720
ROCKET: Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.160
You get a reading
on those tremors?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.880
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.120
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

26:43.280 --> 26:44.440
OKOYE: Nat.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.840
It's an earthquake
under the ocean.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.840
We handle it
by not handling it.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.720
Carol, are we seeing you here
next month?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.280
Not likely.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.920
What? You gonna get
another haircut?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.400
Listen, fur face.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.360
I'm covering
a lot of territory.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.320
The things
that are happening on Earth

27:01.400 --> 27:02.680
are happening everywhere.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.840
On thousands of planets.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.480
All right, all right.
That's a good point.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.680
That's a good point.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.920
So, you might not see me
for a long time.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.440
All right. Uh, well...

27:13.280 --> 27:15.440
This channel's always active.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.680
So, if anything
goes sideways...

27:17.840 --> 27:20.280
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

27:20.440 --> 27:21.600
comes through me.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.320
-Okay.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.840
All right.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.680
Good luck.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
Where are you?

27:36.440 --> 27:37.440
RHODES: Mexico.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.240
The Federales found a room
full of bodies.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.040
Looks like
a bunch of cartel guys...

27:42.200 --> 27:44.160
never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.040
It's probably a rival gang.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.400
Except it isn't.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.760
It's definitely Barton.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.920
What he's done here...

27:52.080 --> 27:55.240
what he's been doing
for the last few years...

27:56.080 --> 27:57.880
I mean,
the scene that he left...

27:58.880 --> 27:59.880
I gotta tell you,

27:59.960 --> 28:02.440
there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.280
Will you find out
where he's going next?

28:14.200 --> 28:15.320
Nat?

28:17.120 --> 28:18.840
Please?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.760
Okay.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.360
STEVE: You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

28:32.720 --> 28:34.280
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.800
NATASHA: You here
to do your laundry?

28:39.960 --> 28:41.560
And to see a friend.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.320
Clearly, your friend is fine.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.360
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

28:49.440 --> 28:50.560
when I was coming over
the bridge.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.560
-In the Hudson?
-There's fewer ships...

28:52.720 --> 28:54.000
cleaner water.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.040
You know,
if you're about to tell me

28:56.120 --> 28:58.080
to look on the bright side...

28:58.280 --> 28:59.480
Um...

29:00.440 --> 29:01.840
I'm about to hit you
in the head

29:01.920 --> 29:04.040
with a peanut butter sandwich.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
Hmm.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.160
Sorry.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.480
Force of habit.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.160
You know,
I keep telling everybody

29:24.280 --> 29:25.880
they should move on...

29:26.240 --> 29:27.720
and grow.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.240
Some do.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.200
But not us.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.000
If I move on, who does this?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.480
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.960
I used to have nothing.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.040
And then I got this.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.040
This job.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.160
This family.

30:03.960 --> 30:05.840
And I was better
because of it.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.640
And even though
they're gone...

30:19.600 --> 30:22.040
I'm still trying to be better.

30:25.080 --> 30:27.480
I think we both need
to get a life.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.320
You first.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.040
Oh, hi, hi!

30:38.120 --> 30:39.320
Uh, is anyone home?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.200
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.200
We met a few years ago
at the airport...

30:44.400 --> 30:46.040
in Germany?

30:46.240 --> 30:48.520
I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.280
-You wouldn't recognize me.
-Is this an old message?

30:50.360 --> 30:53.320
SCOTT: Ant-Man?
I know you know that.

30:53.480 --> 30:54.560
It's the front gate.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.080
SCOTT: I really need
to talk to you guys.

31:02.240 --> 31:03.400
STEVE: Scott.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.360
Are you okay?

31:05.520 --> 31:06.520
Yeah.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.720
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.640
Only to make conversation.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.320
All right, so...

31:15.720 --> 31:18.400
five years ago,
right before...

31:19.000 --> 31:20.120
Thanos...

31:20.520 --> 31:22.600
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.280
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.560
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.280
Hope. She's my, um...

31:31.360 --> 31:33.040
She was my...

31:34.760 --> 31:35.960
She was supposed to
pull me out.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.720
And then Thanos happened...

31:37.880 --> 31:39.560
and I got stuck in there.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.000
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.480
Yeah, but that's just it.

31:43.640 --> 31:44.800
It wasn't.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.200
For me, it was five hours.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.680
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

31:47.760 --> 31:48.880
aren't like they are up here.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.480
Everything is unpredictable.

31:50.640 --> 31:51.880
Is that anybody's sandwich?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.280
I'm starving.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.760
Scott.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.200
What are you talking about?

31:57.200 --> 31:58.480
So...

31:59.400 --> 32:01.000
what I'm saying is...

32:01.880 --> 32:04.280
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.320
The only problem is right now

32:06.440 --> 32:07.840
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
But what if we did?

32:09.680 --> 32:10.880
I can't stop thinking
about it.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

32:13.040 --> 32:14.280
and we could navigate it?

32:14.360 --> 32:15.920
What if there was a way...

32:16.000 --> 32:17.640
that we could enter
the quantum realm

32:17.720 --> 32:18.800
at a certain point in time...

32:18.960 --> 32:20.440
but then exit
the quantum realm

32:20.520 --> 32:21.680
at another point in time?

32:21.840 --> 32:23.200
Like...

32:23.960 --> 32:26.040
-Like before Thanos.
-STEVE: Wait.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.760
Are you talking
about a time machine?

32:27.960 --> 32:30.720
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.920
This is more like a...

32:34.240 --> 32:35.880
Yeah. Like a time machine.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.840
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

32:37.920 --> 32:40.040
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.360
There's gotta be...

32:43.600 --> 32:45.360
-It's crazy.
-NATASHA: Scott.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.840
I get emails from a raccoon...

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.840
So, who do we talk to
about this?

33:10.120 --> 33:11.200
Chow time!

33:13.680 --> 33:14.720
Maguna.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.360
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.400
Define "lunch"

33:22.480 --> 33:23.760
-or be disintegrated.
-Okay.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.640
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.120
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

33:28.200 --> 33:29.280
I'm making for Mom.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.640
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

33:35.800 --> 33:37.720
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.600
-No.
-That's what you want.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.880
How did you find this?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.880
-Garage.
-Really?

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.800
-I found it, though.
-Hmm.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.720
You like
going in the garage, huh?

33:52.920 --> 33:55.760
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

33:58.440 --> 33:59.720
So, I'm gonna...

34:17.240 --> 34:19.760
No.
We know what it sounds like.

34:19.840 --> 34:20.880
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

34:20.960 --> 34:21.960
is anything really impossible?

34:22.080 --> 34:24.280
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

34:24.440 --> 34:26.120
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.240
Can we agree on that?

34:27.400 --> 34:28.480
Thank you.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.760
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.360
-I did.
-No.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.400
You accidentally survived.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.640
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.920
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

34:41.960 --> 34:43.280
A time heist?

34:43.440 --> 34:45.600
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.880
Why didn't we think
of this before?

34:46.960 --> 34:49.520
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.760
The stones are in the past.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.160
We could go back,
we could get them.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.640
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.720
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

34:57.880 --> 34:58.880
I don't believe we would.

34:59.480 --> 35:02.000
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.600
However, high hopes
won't help...

35:04.760 --> 35:06.720
if there's no logical,
tangible way

35:06.800 --> 35:10.280
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.320
I believe
the most likely outcome

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
will be our collective demise.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.320
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.160
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

35:19.240 --> 35:20.800
no betting on sporting events.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.720
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.000
Are you seriously telling me

35:25.080 --> 35:26.880
that your plan
to save the universe...

35:27.040 --> 35:28.720
is based on
Back to the Future?

35:29.840 --> 35:31.600
-Is it?
-No.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.800
Good. You had me
worried there.

35:32.880 --> 35:33.920
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.400
That's not how
quantum physics works.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.720
Tony.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.120
We have to take a stand.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.680
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.320
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.360
You got a wife, a daughter.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.040
But I lost someone
very important to me.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.800
A lotta people did.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.960
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

35:58.120 --> 35:59.280
to bring everyone back,

35:59.360 --> 36:00.880
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

36:00.960 --> 36:02.760
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.800
-I can't.
-

36:07.960 --> 36:10.280
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.800
Good job. I'm saved.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.600
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.800
Anything else.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.680
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

36:18.760 --> 36:20.120
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.720
Tony. I get it.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.200
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.480
But this is a second chance.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.600
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.320
Can't roll the dice on it.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.320
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.760
Well, he's scared.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.560
STEVE: He's not wrong.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.760
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

36:43.840 --> 36:45.120
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

36:46.040 --> 36:48.040
No, I wanna do it right.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.920
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.440
Bigger than his?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.480
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

36:57.560 --> 36:58.600
Try some of that.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.680
Have some eggs.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.520
I'm so confused.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.360
These are confusing times.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.360
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.000
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

37:08.600 --> 37:10.400
I know, it's crazy.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.760
I'm wearing shirts now.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.760
Yeah. What? How? Why?

37:15.240 --> 37:17.560
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.840
Except it was worse for me...

37:20.000 --> 37:21.200
'cause I lost twice.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.160
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

37:24.040 --> 37:25.360
and then, we all lost.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.720
No one blamed you, Bruce.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.240
I did.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.240
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

37:31.320 --> 37:32.480
like he's
some kind of disease...

37:32.560 --> 37:34.000
something to get rid of.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.440
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.120
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.880
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

37:43.040 --> 37:44.320
and now, look at me.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.680
Best of both worlds.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.760
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.280
Can we get a photo?

37:50.680 --> 37:52.680
100%, little person.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.880
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.360
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-SMART HULK: Thanks.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.040
Say "green."

37:59.200 --> 38:01.440
-FANS: Green.
-Green.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
Did you get that?

38:02.680 --> 38:03.960
That's a good one.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.000
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.600
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.840
-Nobody does.
-No, he wants you to take

38:13.920 --> 38:15.640
-a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.800
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.400
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.720
But come on. The kid...

38:20.800 --> 38:22.200
I don't want a picture
with them.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.800
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.440
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.560
-SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.840
SMART HULK: Okay.

38:29.920 --> 38:30.920
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.680
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.520
ALL: Hulk out!

38:34.680 --> 38:35.720
STEVE: Bruce.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.160
Dab.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.120
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
She knows better.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.320
About what we were saying.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.680
Right.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.320
The whole time travel do-over?

38:49.600 --> 38:53.360
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.080
Well, you pulled this off.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.920
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.760
I've got a mild inspiration.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.120
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.280
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

39:38.360 --> 39:39.960
before we pack it in
for the night.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.120
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

39:43.200 --> 39:44.600
inverted, please.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.760
FRIDAY: Processing.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.720
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

39:51.880 --> 39:53.880
factoring in spectral decomp.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.000
-That'll take a second.
-FRIDAY: Just a moment.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.920
And don't worry if it doesn't
pan out. I'm just kinda...

40:01.480 --> 40:02.960
Model rendered.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
Shit!

40:16.120 --> 40:17.360
MORGAN STARK: Shit!

40:21.440 --> 40:23.120
What are you
doing up, little miss?

40:23.280 --> 40:25.000
-Shit.
-Nope. We don't say that.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.400
Only Mommy says that word.

40:26.560 --> 40:27.960
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
Why are you up?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.640
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

40:30.800 --> 40:31.960
Why do you think?

40:32.160 --> 40:33.680
No, I got something
on my mind.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.120
I got something on my mind.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.800
Was it juice pops?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.560
Sure was.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.720
That's extortion.
That's a word.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.080
What kind you want?

40:44.240 --> 40:45.240
Great minds think alike.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.240
Juice pops exactly...

40:49.400 --> 40:50.520
was on my mind.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.080
You done? Yeah?

40:53.600 --> 40:54.840
Now you are.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.560
Here. Wipe.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.960
Good. That face goes there.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.360
Tell me a story.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.120
A story.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.440
Once upon a time,
Maguna went to bed. The end.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.160
That is a horrible story.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.080
Come on,
that's your favorite story.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.960
Love you tons.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.800
I love you 3,000.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.040
Wow.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.280
3,000.
That's crazy.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.280
Go to bed
or I'll sell all your toys.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.840
-Night night.
-

41:35.000 --> 41:36.200
Not that it's a competition...

41:36.720 --> 41:38.640
but she loves me 3,000.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.880
Does she, now?

41:40.040 --> 41:43.080
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.640
Whatcha reading?

41:51.280 --> 41:52.720
Just a book on composting.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.960
What's new with composting?

41:56.440 --> 41:58.480
-Interesting science...
-I figured it out.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.560
By the way.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.600
And, you know,

42:02.680 --> 42:04.800
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

42:04.960 --> 42:06.440
Time travel.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.960
What?

42:12.160 --> 42:13.160
Wow.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.800
That's amazing...

42:19.760 --> 42:20.880
and terrifying.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.480
That's right.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.520
We got really lucky.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.680
Yeah.

42:32.840 --> 42:33.960
I know.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.280
A lot of people didn't.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.040
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

42:38.800 --> 42:40.160
Sorta seems like you can.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.920
Not if I stop.

42:43.120 --> 42:46.000
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

42:46.760 --> 42:47.760
Tony...

42:48.480 --> 42:50.040
trying to get you to stop...

42:50.200 --> 42:52.800
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.800
Something tells me...

43:00.080 --> 43:01.160
I should put it in a lockbox

43:01.240 --> 43:02.760
and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

43:03.960 --> 43:05.160
and go to bed.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.600
But would you be able to rest?

43:18.320 --> 43:21.640
SMART HULK: Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.960
Scott, fire up...

43:24.880 --> 43:26.080
the, uh, van thing.

43:28.360 --> 43:29.400
STEVE: Breakers are set.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.400
Emergency generators
are on standby.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.280
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

43:33.360 --> 43:36.560
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.600
-Excuse me?
-He's kidding.

43:39.800 --> 43:41.680
You can't say things
like that.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.400
It was a bad joke.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
You were kidding, right?

43:46.560 --> 43:49.680
I have no idea. We're talking
about time travel here.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.080
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.920
We're good!

43:54.080 --> 43:55.440
Get your helmet on.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.920
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

43:58.000 --> 43:59.640
let you walk around
for an hour,

43:59.720 --> 44:01.240
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.400
Make sense?

44:03.040 --> 44:04.320
Perfectly not confusing.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.440
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.040
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.520
On a count of three...

44:14.680 --> 44:18.560
Three, two, one.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.480
Uh... Guys?

44:23.960 --> 44:25.520
This doesn't feel right.

44:25.640 --> 44:26.640
STEVE: What is this?

44:26.720 --> 44:27.720
-What's going on?
-NATASHA: Who is that?

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
-Hold on.
-Is that Scott?

44:28.880 --> 44:29.880
Yes, it's Scott.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.400
-What's going on, Bruce?
-Oh, my back!

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
-What is this?
-Hold on a second.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Could I get
a little space here?

44:37.640 --> 44:38.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

44:38.840 --> 44:39.880
I'm working on it.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
It's a baby.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.640
-It's Scott.
-STEVE: As a baby.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.280
-SMART HULK: He'll grow.
-Bring Scott back.

44:51.360 --> 44:52.800
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.160
Oh, my God.

44:54.880 --> 44:56.240
And... kill it!

45:00.640 --> 45:02.440
Somebody peed my pants.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.560
Oh, thank God.

45:03.760 --> 45:06.960
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.240
Or just me me.

45:12.680 --> 45:13.880
Time travel!

45:17.640 --> 45:18.640
What?

45:20.320 --> 45:22.560
I see this as an absolute win.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.200
-

46:08.240 --> 46:09.520
Why the long face?

46:09.680 --> 46:11.440
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

46:12.680 --> 46:14.680
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

46:14.840 --> 46:16.280
It's the EPR Paradox.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.080
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
you might've wound up...

46:19.280 --> 46:20.680
pushing time through Lang.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.000
It's tricky, dangerous.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.520
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.720
You did.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.040
Oh, did I?

46:26.200 --> 46:27.880
Well, thank God I'm here.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.280
Regardless, I fixed it.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.680
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.000
I just want peace.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.360
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.600
Me, too.

46:44.840 --> 46:46.320
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

46:46.400 --> 46:48.320
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.800
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.800
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.640
And maybe not die trying.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.880
Would be nice.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.400
Sounds like a deal.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Tony, I don't know.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.800
Why?

47:28.960 --> 47:30.760
He made it for you.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.680
Plus, honestly, I have to
get it out of the garage

47:32.760 --> 47:34.520
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.200
Thank you, Tony.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.720
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

47:44.440 --> 47:45.840
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.880
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

47:51.040 --> 47:52.800
We're working on that
right now.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.920
ROCKET: Hey, Humie.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.280
Where's Big Green?

48:14.600 --> 48:16.640
The kitchen, I think.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.120
That's awesome.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.400
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

48:22.560 --> 48:24.280
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

48:25.440 --> 48:26.560
Oh, God.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.200
WAR MACHINE: What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?

49:20.040 --> 49:22.520
ROCKET: Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

49:22.600 --> 49:24.320
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

49:24.480 --> 49:25.840
Hey, have
a little compassion, pal.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.960
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.680
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.560
You shouldn't have come.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.200
Ah!

49:33.640 --> 49:34.640
Valkyrie!

49:34.800 --> 49:37.520
Great to see you, angry girl!

49:37.680 --> 49:39.880
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.960
-This is Rocket.
-How ya doing?

49:45.360 --> 49:46.360
He won't see you.

49:46.680 --> 49:47.720
It's that bad, huh?

49:47.920 --> 49:49.320
We only see him once a month

49:49.400 --> 49:52.520
when he comes
in for "supplies."

49:53.600 --> 49:54.760
It's that bad.

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
Yeah.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.480
What the...?

50:09.560 --> 50:11.120
-

50:11.960 --> 50:14.560
Whew! Something died in here!

50:14.640 --> 50:17.920
-SMART HULK: Hello? Thor!

50:18.480 --> 50:20.160
THOR: Are you here
about the cable?

50:20.880 --> 50:22.960
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

50:23.560 --> 50:26.320
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.080
SMART HULK: Thor?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.560
Boys! Oh, my God!

50:39.200 --> 50:41.960
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

50:43.400 --> 50:44.720
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.360
-Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.
-

50:47.520 --> 50:48.600
That's not necessary.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.720
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

50:51.880 --> 50:53.000
-Hey, boys!
-SMART HULK: Hey, guys.

50:53.160 --> 50:54.440
Long time no see.

50:54.600 --> 50:55.600
Beer's in the bucket.

50:55.680 --> 50:56.840
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.720
No password, obviously.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.320
Thor, he's back.

51:01.480 --> 51:04.160
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.720
Noobmaster.

51:05.880 --> 51:08.360
KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

51:08.520 --> 51:09.680
I am sick of this.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.280
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.520
You know, the God of Thunder.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.880
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

51:16.040 --> 51:17.520
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

51:17.680 --> 51:19.160
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

51:19.320 --> 51:21.960
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

51:22.320 --> 51:23.400
Oh, that's right, yes!

51:23.520 --> 51:25.360
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

51:26.080 --> 51:27.080
Thank you, Thor.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.600
Let me know if
he bothers you again, okay?

51:28.760 --> 51:29.960
Thank you very much. I will.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.320
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

51:32.440 --> 51:34.840
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.120
SMART HULK: Buddy.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.760
-You all right?
-Yes, I'm fine. Why?

51:41.920 --> 51:42.960
Why, don't I look all right?

51:43.400 --> 51:44.800
You look
like melted ice cream.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.880
So, what's up? You just here
for a hang, or what?

51:49.080 --> 51:51.200
-We need your help.
-Mm.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.560
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.080
What, like the cable?

51:55.160 --> 51:57.440
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.600
Like Thanos.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.640
Don't say that name.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.480
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

52:29.320 --> 52:31.200
SMART HULK: Please take
your hand off me.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.640
Now, I know that guy...

52:38.560 --> 52:39.680
might scare you.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.560
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

52:44.760 --> 52:46.560
I'm the one
who killed that guy, remember?

52:46.680 --> 52:47.840
Hmm.

52:47.920 --> 52:49.800
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

52:53.200 --> 52:54.280
Nope.

52:54.840 --> 52:55.840
Didn't think so.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.760
Korg, why don't you, uh,
tell everybody

52:58.840 --> 53:01.200
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

53:01.280 --> 53:02.760
Um, Stormbreaker?

53:02.920 --> 53:04.560
THOR: Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

53:08.640 --> 53:10.840
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay?

53:11.040 --> 53:12.040
I've been there myself.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.480
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

53:14.640 --> 53:17.000
Was it Natasha?

53:17.440 --> 53:19.320
It was you.

53:19.480 --> 53:21.440
You helped me.

53:22.640 --> 53:24.120
So, why don't you ask...

53:25.200 --> 53:27.520
the Asgardians down there...

53:27.720 --> 53:29.400
how much my help is worth?

53:35.080 --> 53:36.560
The ones
that are left, anyway.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.680
I think we could
bring them back.

53:38.760 --> 53:40.600
Stop.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.760
I know you think I'm down here

53:44.840 --> 53:46.480
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

53:46.640 --> 53:49.200
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

53:49.360 --> 53:51.440
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

53:51.600 --> 53:53.080
Oh, we're good here, mate.

53:53.240 --> 53:55.200
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.880
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.120
Goodbye.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.200
SMART HULK: We need you, pal.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.640
There's beer on the ship.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.320
What kind?

54:29.840 --> 54:31.800
-

56:06.520 --> 56:09.600
What I want you can't give me.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.680
You shouldn't be here.

56:37.400 --> 56:39.160
Neither should you.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.600
I've got a job to do.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.840
NATASHA: Is that what
you're calling this?

56:50.920 --> 56:53.320
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.240
We found something.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.080
A chance, maybe.

57:06.160 --> 57:08.640
Don't.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.000
Don't what?

57:14.040 --> 57:15.520
Don't give me hope.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.320
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

57:42.880 --> 57:44.160
You're drifting left.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.480
One side there, Lebowski.

57:49.680 --> 57:50.960
Ratchet, how's it going?

57:51.120 --> 57:52.120
It's Rocket.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.840
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.360
RHODES: Time travel suit,
not bad.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.320
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

58:04.400 --> 58:05.400
I'm being very careful.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.000
No, you're being very Hulky.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
I'm being careful.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.600
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

58:09.760 --> 58:11.040
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

58:11.120 --> 58:12.360
out of existence, this is it.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.200
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.280
-Scott, calm down.
-SCOTT: Sorry.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.600
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.800
No do-overs.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.160
Plus two test runs.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.680
-

58:27.160 --> 58:28.160
One test run.

58:29.520 --> 58:31.080
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

58:31.280 --> 58:32.560
BARTON: I'm game.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.520
I'll do it.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.320
SMART HULK:
Clint, now you're gonna feel

58:38.400 --> 58:39.880
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

58:39.960 --> 58:40.960
Don't worry about that.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.200
RHODES: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.000
If we can do this, you know...

58:44.160 --> 58:46.480
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

58:46.640 --> 58:47.800
You know, and...

58:51.400 --> 58:52.920
First of all, that's horrible.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
It's Thanos.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.160
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

58:56.320 --> 58:58.480
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

58:58.680 --> 59:00.040
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

59:00.120 --> 59:01.360
before Thanos gets them...

59:01.520 --> 59:04.280
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

59:04.480 --> 59:06.280
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.360
Well, that's what I heard.

59:07.480 --> 59:08.600
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

59:08.760 --> 59:10.560
Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...

59:10.720 --> 59:12.320
-Time After Time.
-Quantum Leap.

59:12.480 --> 59:13.520
Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.

59:13.600 --> 59:14.600
Hot Tub Time Machine.

59:14.680 --> 59:15.720
Hot Tub Time Machine.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.040
Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

59:17.240 --> 59:19.320
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

59:19.480 --> 59:21.320
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

59:21.480 --> 59:22.520
This is known.

59:22.680 --> 59:23.880
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

59:24.000 --> 59:25.040
but that isn't true.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.120
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

59:27.280 --> 59:29.600
that past becomes
your future...

59:29.760 --> 59:32.720
and your former present
becomes the past...

59:32.920 --> 59:35.520
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.920
Exactly.

59:37.480 --> 59:40.360
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

59:44.280 --> 59:46.240
-All right, Clint.
-

59:46.360 --> 59:49.440
We're going in three, two...

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
one.

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.280
LILA: Cooper?

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:06.000
Where are my headphones?

1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:07.080
Lila?

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.280
-COOPER: I never had them.
-Lila?

1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:12.080
LILA: Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:13.960
Lila! Lila!

1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:20.480
Yeah, Dad?

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.400
Dad?

1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:29.160
Lila!

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:37.440
Hey. Hey, look at me.

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:38.720
You okay?

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:44.560
It worked.

1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:47.720
It worked.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.680
STEVE: Okay, so the how works.

1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.400
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:59.000
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:00.840
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.520
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:03.760
for "damn near been killed"

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:05.280
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:06.600
Well, I haven't...

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:07.680
but I don't even know

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.120
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:12.160
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.040
for one round-trip each.

1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:15.400
And these stones have been

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.400
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:18.880
Our history.

1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:22.040
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:24.000
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:25.720
Correct.

1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:28.680
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:30.040
Thor, what do you know?

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:36.840
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.560
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:44.320
Uh, where to start? Um...

1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:48.520
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:50.800
Someone called it
a stone before.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.200
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:58.000
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1:02:58.080 --> 1:02:59.240
and stop saying that.

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:02.240
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:04.280
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.960
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:10.840
Scary beings.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.720
So, Jane, actually...

1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:14.840
Oh, there she is.

1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:18.680
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:22.880
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.880
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.080
and she became
very, very sick.

1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:30.160
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:31.400
which is where I'm from...

1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:33.520
and we had to try and fix her.

1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:35.320
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:38.880
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:42.240
who's dead and, um...

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:45.160
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:47.160
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:49.480
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:50.960
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:52.880
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.600
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.120
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.360
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:03.640
ROCKET: Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:07.440
-SMART HULK: Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.520
Quill was a person.

1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:12.600
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:14.200
Oh, look.

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:16.960
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:20.320
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:21.600
I'll take you to space.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.920
NEBULA: Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:27.040
What is Vormir?

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:28.360
NEBULA: A dominion of death...

1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:30.960
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:36.880
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:44.320
Not it.

1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:47.720
NATASHA: That Time Stone guy.
SMART HULK: Doctor Strange.

1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:49.680
NATASHA: Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:51.800
TONY: Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.360
SMART HULK: Nice place
in the Village, though.

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:55.040
TONY: Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:56.240
SMART HULK:
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:57.440
Wait, he lived in New York?

1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:59.080
TONY: No, he lived in Toronto.

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:00.200
Uh, yeah,
on Bleecker and Sullivan.

1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:01.280
Have you been listening
to anything?

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.360
Guys.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.120
If you pick the right year,

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:05.840
there are three stones
in New York.

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:10.000
Shut the front door.

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.880
STEVE: All right.
We have a plan.

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.640
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:31.200
STEVE: Five years ago,
we lost.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:33.840
All of us.

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.160
We lost friends.

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:39.520
We lost family.

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.320
We lost a part of ourselves.

1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:47.120
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:51.360
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:54.120
Get the stones. Get them back.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:56.120
One round-trip each.

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:57.360
No mistakes...

1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:59.600
no do-overs.

1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:01.640
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:03.640
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:05.800
Be careful.

1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:07.720
Look out for each other.

1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:10.960
This is the fight
of our lives...

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:13.440
and we're gonna win.

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:16.600
Whatever it takes.

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.320
Good luck.

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:22.560
He's pretty good at that.

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:23.920
-Right?
-TONY: All right.

1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:25.080
You heard the man.

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:26.400
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:28.920
SMART HULK: Trackers engaged.

1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:31.520
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:33.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.080
Okay, I'll do my best.

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.040
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:41.240
-See ya in a minute.

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:36.960
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:39.360
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:41.440
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1:07:56.920 --> 1:07:58.720
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:01.840
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:31.040
ANCIENT ONE:
I'd be careful going that way.

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:32.720
We just had the floors waxed.

1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:39.680
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:44.160
You're about
five years too early.

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.080
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:48.680
about 20 blocks that way.

1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:51.480
What do you want from him?

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:53.360
That, actually.

1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:55.440
Ah!

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:57.600
I'm afraid not.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.400
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:01.320
You don't want to do this.

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:03.120
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.720
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:15.320
Let's start over, shall we?

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:28.480
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN:
For you, Lady Jane.

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:30.920
JANE: Um, so you have anything
with pants?

1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:32.200
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Pants?

1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:34.400
JANE: Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:36.160
ASGARDIAN MAIDEN: Yes, milady.
THOR: Oh, there's Jane.

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:38.800
All right.

1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:41.640
Here's the deal, tubby.

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:42.840
You're gonna charm her,

1:09:42.920 --> 1:09:44.200
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:46.800
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:49.680
I'll be right back, okay?

1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.520
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:54.560
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:56.120
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.040
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:06.400
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:07.480
Yes, milady.

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:08.600
And ask our librarians

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:11.520
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.200
Who's the fancy broad?

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:22.040
That's my mother.

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.280
She dies today.

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:26.720
Oh, that is today?

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.800
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:37.960
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:39.240
It's a bad idea!

1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:40.560
-Come here.
-No, no, no.

1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:43.160
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:44.240
Come here. Right here.

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:45.320
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:47.840
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:49.760
What do you think
we're doing here?

1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:52.080
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:54.680
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:56.240
all gone.

1:10:56.960 --> 1:10:58.320
I get you miss your mom...

1:10:58.600 --> 1:10:59.800
but she's gone.

1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:00.960
Really gone.

1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:04.400
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:05.680
and you can help them.

1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.320
So, is it too much to ask

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:10.000
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:12.480
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.800
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.560
and help me
get my family back?

1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.240
Okay.

1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:21.520
Are you crying?

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:23.440
No.

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:26.440
Yes.

1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:27.840
I feel like I'm losing it.

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000
Get it together!

1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:31.000
-You can do this.
-

1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:32.680
You can do this.

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:36.840
All right?

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000
Yes, I can.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:39.160
Good.

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.720
I can do this. I can do this.

1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:46.000
I can't do this.

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:48.040
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:49.600
This is our shot.

1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:52.360
Thor? Thor!

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.000
WAR MACHINE: All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.560
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:12.920
-Hey, can we hurry it up?

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.160
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:17.080
All that is really helpful.

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:20.800
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:23.440
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:25.640
-Hey.
-We got this.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.000
-Let's get it done.
-Yes, sir.

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:28.480
I'll see you back.

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:30.520
You guys watch
each other's six.

1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:32.440
Yeah.

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:42.640
NEBULA: Coordinates for Vormir
are laid in.

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:46.200
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:54.480
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:00.880
Okay, so, uh...

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.360
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:07.360
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:09.760
Let's take cover.

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:13.840
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:15.360
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about right now?

1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:16.760
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:21.800
My father...

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.760
my sister...

1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:25.080
and me.

1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:26.400
And you?

1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:29.880
Where are you right now?

1:13:58.560 --> 1:13:59.720
GAMORA: You're welcome.

1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:02.200
I didn't ask for your help.

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.480
And yet, you always need it.

1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:06.920
-

1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:10.520
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:11.680
Why?

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.880
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:19.840
2014 NEBULA: Where?

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.760
GAMORA: On a planet
called Morag.

1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:25.280
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.480
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:28.840
It's a start.

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.800
If he gets all of them...

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.560
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:47.360
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:48.720
He won't like that.

1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:51.040
His alternative is death.

1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:54.280
Ronan's obsession...

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:57.480
clouds his judgment.

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.720
We will not fail you, Father.

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:06.400
No, you won't.

1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:10.080
I swear...

1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:13.880
I will make you proud.

1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:25.920
...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:28.120
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1:15:28.280 --> 1:15:29.840
NEBULA: Let's take cover.

1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:33.760
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:37.600
Who was that?

1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:41.120
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:45.560
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.560
Shh.

1:15:55.800 --> 1:15:57.840
Bring her to my ship.

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:06.320
IRON MAN: Better hustle, Cap.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.560
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.360
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Got it. I'm
approaching the elevator now.

1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.400
LOKI: If it's all the same
to you...

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.240
I'll have that drink now.

1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:24.240
2012 IRON MAN: All right,
get him on his feet.

1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:27.440
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:28.920
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:32.080
Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:33.960
did nothing for your ass.

1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:35.440
CAPTAIN AMERICA: No one
asked you to look, Tony.

1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:36.520
It's ridiculous.

1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:37.720
ANT-MAN:
I think you look great, Cap.

1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:40.240
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:42.280
2012 BLACK WIDOW:
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:43.560
2012 CAPTAIN AMERICA:
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:44.800
-coming to secure it.
-

1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:56.480
SITWELL: We can take that
off your hands.

1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:57.640
By all means.

1:16:59.920 --> 1:17:01.600
Careful with that thing.

1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:03.240
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:04.400
And not in a fun way.

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:05.520
We promise to be careful.

1:17:05.640 --> 1:17:06.760
Who are these guys?

1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:08.200
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:11.480
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:13.800
ANT-MAN: Seriously?
You didn't?

1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.480
I mean,
they look like bad guys.

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:17.040
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:19.040
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:21.200
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:23.800
I mean, honestly, how do you
keep your food down?

1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:25.400
Shut up.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.280
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:29.560
There's our stone.

1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:30.720
ANT-MAN: All right.

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:32.080
Flick me.

1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:47.240
-Move.
-Hey.

1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:49.080
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey, hey. Buddy!

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:51.040
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:52.200
-Take the stairs.

1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:53.960
2012 TONY: Yeah. Stop, stop.

1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.400
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:05.880
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:07.840
just passing the 80th floor.

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:09.640
On it.

1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:11.240
Head to the lobby.

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:12.360
IRON MAN: All right,
I'll see you there.

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:14.320
SITWELL: Evidence secure.

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:15.920
We're en route to Doctor List.

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:19.480
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:25.680
Captain.

1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:26.880
I thought
you were coordinating

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:27.960
search and rescue.

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:29.600
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Change of plans.

1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:34.840
Hey, Cap.

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:37.160
Rumlow.

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:45.320
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:47.360
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:52.120
Sir?
I don't understand.

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:56.400
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.160
Sorry, Cap.

1:18:58.320 --> 1:18:59.760
We can't give you the scepter.

1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:02.200
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:04.480
That's okay. Trust me.

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.000
Hail Hydra.

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.600
So many stairs!

1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:39.960
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:41.200
It is go time.

1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:42.360
Bombs away.

1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:52.000
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:54.480
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:55.640
Can we focus, please?

1:19:55.800 --> 1:19:57.040
ANT-MAN:
I'm going inside you...

1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:58.760
now.

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.160
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:08.600
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:09.760
Alexander Pierce.

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:11.160
He's the man above the folks

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:12.400
-behind Nick Fury.
-Oh.

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:13.680
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:14.760
I'm gonna have to ask you

1:20:14.840 --> 1:20:16.160
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:18.120
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:19.280
PIERCE: No, he's going
to answer to us.

1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:20.640
Odin can have what's left.

1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:22.280
And I'm gonna need that case.

1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:24.240
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:25.400
Hand over the case, Stark.

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:26.960
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:28.240
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:30.040
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:31.800
ANT-MAN: You promise me
you won't die?

1:20:31.960 --> 1:20:34.680
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:36.400
ANT-MAN:
That doesn't sound mild.

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:37.600
I need the case.

1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:39.040
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:40.480
-jurisdiction...
-Okay, then give me the case.

1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:41.640
2012 TONY:
Well, jurisdiction...

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:42.720
AGENT: Hand it over.

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:43.800
Do it, Lang!

1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:44.880
Get your hands off me.

1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:46.440
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:48.160
ANT-MAN: Here goes!

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.520
-Stark?
-2012 THOR: Stark?

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:55.040
AGENT: He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1:20:55.120 --> 1:20:56.800
-Medic!
-Medic!

1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:58.720
Give these guys some help.

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:00.480
-2012 THOR: Speak to me.
-

1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:02.360
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:06.440
Breathe, breathe.

1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:12.960
TONY: Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:14.040
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:21.480
No stairs!

1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:30.960
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:32.040
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:33.280
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:36.120
-Yes!

1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:37.640
Oh, that worked a treat.

1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:38.800
Dude, that was so crazy.

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:40.360
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:42.400
-The case.
-The case is, uh...

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:44.560
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:46.560
Loki!

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:48.120
ANT-MAN: That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?

1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:49.280
Oh, we blew it.

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:50.880
Loki?

1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:54.200
Tony, what's going on?

1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:56.880
Tell me you found that Cube.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.160
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:07.480
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:09.000
I'm not Loki...

1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:14.240
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.160
I can do this all day.

1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:25.600
Yeah, I know.

1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:26.800
I know.

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:00.520
Where did you get this?

1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:14.880
Bucky is alive.

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:19.440
What?

1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:35.920
That is America's ass.

1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:41.400
BANNER: Please, please.

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:43.360
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:45.720
If I give up the Time Stone

1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:47.520
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:49.440
With all due respect,
all right...

1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:52.680
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:00.280
The Infinity Stones create

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:02.640
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.320
Remove one of the stones...

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.600
and that flow splits.

1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:09.200
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1:24:09.360 --> 1:24:11.520
but my new one, not so much.

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:13.600
In this new branch reality...

1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:15.440
without our chief weapon

1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:16.840
against the forces
of darkness...

1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:19.200
our world would be overrun.

1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.040
Millions will suffer.

1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:22.480
So, tell me, Doctor.

1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:25.240
Can your science
prevent all that?

1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:26.400
No...

1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:28.520
but we can erase it.

1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:30.400
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:32.720
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:34.400
at the moment it was taken.

1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.040
So, chronologically...

1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:39.120
in that reality...

1:24:41.720 --> 1:24:43.360
it never left.

1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:48.840
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:54.880
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:57.640
We will. I will. I promise.

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:00.520
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:04.920
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:06.800
to protect the Time Stone.

1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:09.080
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:12.120
What did you say?

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:14.600
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:16.840
-Willingly?
-Yes.

1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:22.400
-Why?
-I have no idea.

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:24.240
Maybe he made a mistake.

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:35.680
Or I did.

1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.360
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:01.040
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.440
I fear you might be right.

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:09.640
Thank you.

1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:17.560
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:20.800
We all are.

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:42.840
Run diagnostics.

1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:45.520
Show me her memory file.

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:49.600
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:52.720
It was a memory, but not hers.

1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:55.360
There's another
consciousness...

1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:56.840
sharing her network.

1:26:57.400 --> 1:26:58.720
Another Nebula.

1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:02.320
Impossible.

1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:05.120
EBONY MAW: This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.200
from nine years in the future.

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:15.280
Where is this other Nebula?

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:17.960
EBONY MAW: In our solar system
on Morag.

1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:20.800
Can you access her?

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:23.000
EBONY MAW:
Yes, the two are linked.

1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:25.240
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:27.600
for Infinity Stones.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:32.320
BANNER:
And these stones have been

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:34.120
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:35.360
Our history.

1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:37.600
So, not a lot
of convenient spots

1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:38.880
to just drop in.

1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:40.720
BARTON: Which means
we have to pick our targets.

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:42.160
TONY: Correct.
THANOS: Freeze image.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.360
GAMORA: Terrans.

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:48.080
Avengers.

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:50.880
Unruly wretches.

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:52.560
What's that reflection?

1:27:54.200 --> 1:27:55.360
Amplify this, Maw.

1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:00.080
GAMORA: I don't understand.

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:06.360
Two Nebulas.

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.960
THANOS: No.
The same Nebula...

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:11.520
from two different times.

1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:14.400
Set course for Morag.

1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:16.960
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:20.080
I wanna see everything.

1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:31.920
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.440
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:48.840
What are you doing?

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.080
-

1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:51.680
-FRIGGA: Oh, God!

1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:54.280
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:56.280
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:57.800
What are you wearing?

1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:00.320
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:04.360
THOR: Mm...

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:05.800
What's wrong with your eye?

1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:06.960
Oh, my eye.

1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:09.080
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:10.520
when I got hit in the face

1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:12.360
with the broadsword?

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:17.920
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:20.400
Yes, I am.

1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:23.400
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:25.760
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:28.800
I was raised by witches, boy.

1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:32.200
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.560
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:38.320
Yes, you are, honey.

1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:40.000
I really need to talk to you.

1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:41.160
We can talk.

1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:07.280
His head was over there...

1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:10.400
and his body over there...

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:14.200
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:16.480
I was just standing there.

1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:19.200
Some idiot with an axe.

1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:21.080
FRIGGA: Now, you're no idiot.

1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:23.800
You're here, aren't you?

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.480
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:27.840
I am. Yes.

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:29.360
FRIGGA: Idiot, no.

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:31.000
A failure?

1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:32.320
Absolutely.

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:34.280
That's a little bit harsh.

1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:35.920
Do you know
what that makes you?

1:30:37.160 --> 1:30:39.160
Just like everyone else.

1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:41.400
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:42.600
FRIGGA: Mm.

1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:45.840
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:49.600
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:53.160
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1:30:58.400 --> 1:30:59.880
I've really missed you, Mom.

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:07.520
Thor! I got it!

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:09.920
ASGARDIAN GUARD:
Get that rabbit!

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.520
Mom, I have to tell you
something.

1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:16.480
No, son, you don't.

1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:19.160
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:20.960
This is about your future.

1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:22.480
Uh, it's none of my business.

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:24.600
-

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:27.720
Hi.

1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:29.920
You must be Mom.

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:31.520
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:33.160
Oh, I wish we had more time.

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:35.160
No, this was a gift.

1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:38.760
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:41.360
-I love you, Mom.
-I love you.

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:47.760
And eat a salad.

1:31:48.760 --> 1:31:49.880
Come on, we gotta go.

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:51.640
-Goodbye.
-ROCKET: Three...

1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:52.880
-Two...
-No, wait!

1:31:56.160 --> 1:31:57.360
What am I looking at?

1:31:57.520 --> 1:31:58.960
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1:32:08.440 --> 1:32:10.480
I'm still worthy.

1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:13.520
Oh, boy.

1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:16.640
-Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1:32:55.880 --> 1:32:57.480
So, he's an idiot?

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:00.240
Yeah.

1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:09.960
RHODES: What's that?

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:12.000
The tool of a thief.

1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:20.920
RHODES: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:23.400
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.040
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:26.360
What are you talking about?

1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:27.560
When you break into
a place called

1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:28.840
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:30.320
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:32.720
-Oh, my God.
-Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:07.520
I wasn't always like this.

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:09.440
Me either.

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:12.680
But we work
with what we got, right?

1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:15.480
Hmm.

1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:18.120
Let's sync up.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.440
Three, two, one.

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:36.920
BANNER:
You murdered trillions!

1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:38.400
THANOS:
You should be grateful.

1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:41.720
NATASHA:
Where are the stones?

1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:42.880
Gone.

1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:44.640
Reduced to atoms.

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:47.040
BANNER: You used them
two days ago!

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:50.320
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:52.320
It nearly killed me.

1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:54.400
But the work is done.

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.400
It always will be.

1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:01.160
I am inevitable.

1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:04.440
What did you do to them?

1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:05.880
Nothing.

1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:08.040
Yet.

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:11.760
They're not trying
to stop something

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:13.560
I'm going to do in our time.

1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:15.880
They're trying
to undo something

1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:17.520
I've already done in theirs.

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:19.360
The stones.

1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:22.160
I found them all.

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:25.360
I won.

1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:29.040
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:34.800
This is your future.

1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:37.200
It's my destiny.

1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:40.440
NEBULA:
My father is many things.

1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:42.440
A liar is not one of them.

1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:45.120
Ah.

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.080
Thank you, daughter.

1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:50.400
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:57.800
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1:35:58.200 --> 1:35:59.600
Sire...

1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:00.880
your daughter...

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:04.360
NEBULA: No!

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:05.840
...is a traitor.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.480
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:09.800
I would never betray you.

1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:11.800
Never. Never.

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:18.720
THANOS: I know.

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.960
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:30.320
No!

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:32.240
He knows!

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.880
Barton! Barton, come in.

1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:40.800
Romanoff!

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:42.840
Come in, we have a problem.

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.120
Come on!

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:45.720
Come in, we have a...

1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:47.240
Thanos knows.

1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:49.120
Thanos...

1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:03.960
TONY: Cap.

1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:07.840
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:10.000
Yeah, we do.

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:11.680
STEVE: Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:12.840
TONY: You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:14.280
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:15.920
You said
that we had one shot.

1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:17.440
This was our shot.

1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:19.600
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:21.200
-It was six stones or nothing.
-You're repeating yourself,

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:22.320
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:24.120
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1:37:24.200 --> 1:37:25.200
Dude. Come on!

1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:26.320
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:27.400
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:28.680
-I dropped the ball.
-You ruined the time heist.

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:30.160
TONY: Is that what I did?
SCOTT: Yeah.

1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:32.000
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:33.400
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:34.800
There's no do-overs.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:37.040
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:38.120
Each.

1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:40.520
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:41.840
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:44.000
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1:37:44.160 --> 1:37:45.320
then no one else
is going home, either.

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:46.480
I got it.

1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:49.960
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:51.760
and acquire new particles.

1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:53.640
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:56.240
Military installation,
Garden State.

1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:01.640
When were they both there?

1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:04.160
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:05.840
-How vague?
-SCOTT: What are you

1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:06.960
talking about?
Where are we going?

1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:08.040
TONY: I know for a fact
they were there.

1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:09.120
Who's they? What are we doing?

1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:10.320
And I know how I know.

1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:13.760
SCOTT: Guys, what is it?

1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:15.960
Looks like we're improvising.

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:17.360
-Great.
-What are we improvising?

1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:19.200
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:20.360
TONY: Suit up.

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.040
-What's in New Jersey?
-TONY: 0-4.

1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.120
0-4.

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:24.320
-TONY: Uh, 0-7.
-0-7.

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:26.280
-Excuse me.
-1-9-7-0.

1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:27.760
Are you sure?

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:29.120
SCOTT: Cap? Captain?

1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.120
Steve? Sorry.

1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:32.920
America. Rogers.

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:34.280
Look, if you do this...

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:37.120
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:40.000
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.240
You trust me?

1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:44.280
I do.

1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:46.680
Your call.

1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:49.280
Here we go.

1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:08.960
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:17.520
TONY: Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:19.200
STEVE: The idea of me was.

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:21.920
TONY: Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:25.360
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.240
where do you hide it?

1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:30.080
In plain sight.

1:39:58.480 --> 1:39:59.640
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:02.320
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:06.840
You new here?

1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:10.720
Not exactly.

1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.240
Come on, you bastard.

1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:27.520
Gotcha.

1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:33.400
Whew.

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:46.720
Back in the game.

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:50.600
HOWARD: Arnim, you in there?

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:52.600
Arnim?

1:40:57.880 --> 1:40:59.240
Hey!

1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:01.600
The door is this way, pal.

1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:03.480
Oh, yeah.

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:05.520
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:09.120
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:11.960
Pardon me.

1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:14.320
Do I know you?

1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:16.560
No, sir. Uh...

1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:19.840
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:21.520
Oh. MIT.

1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.120
Got a name?

1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:24.720
Howard.

1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:27.360
-That'll be easy to remember.
-Howard...

1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:29.360
Potts.

1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:32.160
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:33.360
Hi.

1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:34.720
Shake that, don't pull it.

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:35.880
Yeah.

1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:39.520
You look a little green around
the gills, there, Potts.

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:41.840
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:43.720
You wanna get some air?

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:48.080
-Hello, Potts.
-Yeah.

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:49.480
-That'd be swell.
-That way.

1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:50.640
Okay.

1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:52.440
Need your briefcase?

1:41:56.800 --> 1:41:59.360
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:07.000
HANK PYM: Hello?
STEVE:  Doctor Pym?

1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:09.360
HANK PYM: That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.800
This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.

1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:13.080
We have a package for you.

1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:14.640
Oh, bring it up.

1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:16.760
That's the thing, sir,
we can't.

1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:20.520
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:22.040
Well, it's just...

1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:23.680
Sir, the box is glowing...

1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:24.840
and to be honest,

1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:26.640
some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:28.520
They didn't open it, did they?

1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:30.840
Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1:42:31.680 --> 1:42:33.600
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:04.320
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:06.520
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:09.520
And too much time
at the office.

1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:12.720
Congratulations.

1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:15.040
-Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
-Yeah, sure.

1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:18.200
-How far along is she?
-Uh, I don't know.

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:21.120
She's at the point where

1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:22.760
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:26.360
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:28.280
I have a little girl.

1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:29.960
A girl would be nice.

1:43:30.120 --> 1:43:32.120
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:34.240
What'd be so awful about that?

1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:36.440
Let's just say
that the greater good

1:43:36.520 --> 1:43:39.800
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:45.000
GUARD: And you've never seen
these two men before?

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:46.880
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:48.080
Can you describe them?

1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:49.320
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:51.640
GUARD: Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:52.840
FEMALE AGENT:
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:54.040
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:55.280
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:57.240
We have a potential breach.

1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:16.120
PEGGY: I said bring them in.

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.280
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:18.400
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:19.520
Oh, for the love of...

1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.080
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.120
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:00.160
TONY: So, where you at
with names?

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:03.480
HOWARD: Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:05.600
TONY: Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:07.120
-You got time.
-Uh-huh.

1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.000
Let me ask you a question.

1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:14.280
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:15.920
-Wildly.
-

1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:17.720
-Yeah.
-Did you feel qualified?

1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:19.760
Like you had any idea

1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:21.480
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:24.720
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:26.920
I thought about
what my dad did.

1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:28.640
My old man,

1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:30.480
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:32.640
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:34.120
And now, looking back on it,

1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:35.520
I just remember
the good stuff.

1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:37.240
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:38.800
Yeah? Like what?

1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:42.440
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:44.800
Smart guy.

1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:46.680
He did his best.

1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:49.560
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:52.000
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:02.160
Good to meet you, Potts.

1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:03.640
Yeah.

1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:05.240
Howard...

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:07.400
everything's gonna be
all right.

1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:11.680
Thank you...

1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:13.960
for everything...

1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:16.680
you've done for this country.

1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:20.680
HOWARD: Jarvis.

1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:25.920
Have we ever met that guy?

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:29.440
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:33.680
Seems very familiar.

1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:36.080
Weird beard.

1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:45.400
You're weak.

1:46:45.960 --> 1:46:47.040
I'm you.

1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.760
NEBULA: You could stop this.

1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:08.840
You know you want to.

1:47:09.560 --> 1:47:11.720
Did you see
what happens in the future?

1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.400
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1:47:16.920 --> 1:47:18.920
You wanna know
how he does that?

1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:24.480
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:26.000
That's enough.

1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:27.880
-

1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:40.240
You disgust me.

1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:46.440
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:09.840
How do I look?

1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:17.400
Wow.

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:21.520
Under different
circumstances...

1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:23.720
this would be totally awesome.

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:37.000
I bet the raccoon

1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:38.680
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:40.760
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:42.480
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:44.000
RED SKULL: Welcome.

1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.480
Natasha.

1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:49.640
Daughter of Ivan.

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.120
Clint.

1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:54.560
Son of Edith.

1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:01.400
Who are you?

1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:04.480
Consider me a guide...

1:49:04.680 --> 1:49:06.320
to you...

1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:08.320
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:09.560
Oh, good.

1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:11.840
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:18.000
If only it were that easy.

1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:33.840
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:37.480
As does what you fear.

1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:44.280
The stone's down there.

1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:46.840
RED SKULL: For one of you.

1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:48.840
For the other...

1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:53.440
In order to take the stone...

1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:56.600
you must lose
that which you love.

1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:01.120
An everlasting exchange.

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:06.240
A soul for a soul.

1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:11.400
BARTON: How's it going?

1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:15.040
Jesus.

1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:17.080
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:19.280
No.

1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:21.120
I don't think so.

1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:24.000
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:26.560
I didn't.

1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:30.400
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:32.640
without his daughter.

1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:34.880
That's not a coincidence.

1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:37.600
Yeah.

1:50:39.320 --> 1:50:41.200
Whatever it takes.

1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:47.200
Whatever it takes.

1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:53.520
If we don't get that stone...

1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:55.360
billions of people stay dead.

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:57.400
Yeah.

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:01.400
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:03.320
I guess we do.

1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:13.880
I'm starting to think we mean

1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:16.480
different people here,
Natasha.

1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:18.800
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.240
Get to right here.

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:22.400
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.760
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:26.920
What, you think I wanna do it?

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:29.280
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:31.760
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1:51:32.680 --> 1:51:34.880
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:38.360
You know what I've become.

1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:43.080
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:48.480
Maybe you should.

1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:50.920
You didn't.

1:51:57.080 --> 1:51:59.280
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:11.600
Okay.

1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:14.880
You win.

1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:22.480
Tell my family I love 'em.

1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:27.400
You tell 'em yourself.

1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:01.280
Damn you.

1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:09.800
Wait.

1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:19.680
Let me go.

1:53:20.920 --> 1:53:21.920
No.

1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:24.680
No. Please, no.

1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:29.880
It's okay.

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:32.920
Please.

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:36.040
No!

1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:18.480
Did we get 'em all?

1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:21.720
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:27.760
Clint, where's Nat?

1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:58.000
Do we know if she had family?

1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:00.320
Yeah.

1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:01.520
Us.

1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:03.960
What?

1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:05.840
Huh?

1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:07.160
-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:08.520
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:09.800
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1:56:09.880 --> 1:56:11.120
We have the stones, right?

1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:12.320
As long as we have
the stones...

1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:14.240
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:16.400
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:17.760
Can't get her back.

1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:22.040
What's he...?
What?

1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:23.400
It can't be undone.

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.680
It can't.

1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:29.560
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:31.320
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:32.800
And we're talking
about space magic.

1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:34.960
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:36.480
Yeah, look,
I know that I'm way outside

1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:37.960
my pay grade here.

1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:39.600
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:40.760
THOR: No, that's my point.

1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:43.880
It can't be undone.

1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:45.480
Or that's at least

1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.360
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.000
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:52.240
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:02.800
It was supposed to be me.

1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:07.360
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:09.000
She bet her life on it.

1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:16.240
She's not coming back.

1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.480
We have to make it worth it.

1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:21.520
We have to.

1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:24.640
We will.

1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:50.440
Boom!

1:57:56.120 --> 1:57:57.560
All right, the glove's ready.

1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:00.960
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.200
-I'll do it.
-TONY: Excuse me?

1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:04.360
THOR: It's okay.

1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:05.440
TONY: Stop, stop. Slow down.

1:58:05.560 --> 1:58:07.040
Thor. Just wait.

1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:09.040
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1:58:09.440 --> 1:58:11.000
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:12.320
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:13.640
We should at least discuss it.

1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:15.760
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:17.640
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:20.200
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:21.600
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:22.960
-Normally, you're right.
-It's my duty.

1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:24.920
-It's not about that.
-It's not that.

1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:26.880
-TONY: Hey, buddy...
-Stop it! Just let me.

1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:31.400
Just let me do it.

1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:34.080
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:35.240
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1:58:35.400 --> 1:58:36.520
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:37.520
to light up a continent.

1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:39.680
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:42.920
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1:58:43.080 --> 1:58:44.120
Cheez Whiz?

1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:47.680
Lightning.

1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:48.960
-Yeah.
-Lightning.

1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:50.520
SMART HULK:
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:52.520
It's gotta be me.

1:58:53.840 --> 1:58:56.000
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

1:58:56.160 --> 1:58:57.720
They almost killed him.

1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:01.000
None of you could survive.

1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:03.360
STEVE: How do we know
you will?

1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:04.560
SMART HULK: We don't.

1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:07.400
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:12.480
It's like...

1:59:14.360 --> 1:59:16.280
I was made for this.

1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:36.720
Good to go, yeah?

1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:39.840
Let's do it.

1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:41.400
Okay, remember,

1:59:41.480 --> 1:59:43.040
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:45.680
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:47.280
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1:59:48.680 --> 1:59:49.840
Got it.

2:00:06.240 --> 2:00:07.480
IRON MAN:
Friday, do me a favor

2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:09.040
and activate
Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

2:00:09.200 --> 2:00:10.480
FRIDAY: Yes, boss.

2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:20.920
Everybody comes home.

2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:45.760
Take it off! Take it off!

2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:47.040
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.400
-IRON MAN: Talk to me, Banner.

2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:53.600
I'm okay.

2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.360
I'm okay.

2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:27.960
STEVE: Bruce!

2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:31.280
Don't move him.

2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:40.160
-Did it work?
-We're not sure. It's okay.

2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:27.560
Honey.

2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:28.680
LAURA: Clint?

2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:30.080
Honey.

2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:32.280
Guys...

2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:36.120
I think it worked.

2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:20.600
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:21.760
-

2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:23.640
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:32.080
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:34.800
ROCKET: Let me up! Let me up!

2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:36.280
Come on!

2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:47.280
Rhodey!

2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:50.160
ROCKET: Huh?

2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:57.520
RHODES: Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?

2:03:57.600 --> 2:03:58.840
We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!

2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:00.720
ANT-MAN: What? What?

2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.080
RHODES: We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:05.400
ANT-MAN: Wait! I'm here!

2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:07.080
I'm here. Can you hear me?

2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:27.920
Cap?

2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:53.040
Okay.

2:05:12.320 --> 2:05:13.440
Daughter.

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:14.760
Yes, Father.

2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:18.360
So, this is the future.

2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:19.840
Well done.

2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:22.280
Thank you, Father.

2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:23.800
They suspected nothing.

2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:27.600
The arrogant never do.

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:31.680
Go.

2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:35.080
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:36.960
What will you do?

2:05:38.280 --> 2:05:39.960
Wait.

2:06:05.200 --> 2:06:06.840
Tell me something.

2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.400
In the future...

2:06:10.560 --> 2:06:12.440
what happens to you and me?

2:06:14.720 --> 2:06:16.360
I try to kill you.

2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:19.600
Several times.

2:06:20.680 --> 2:06:22.640
But eventually...

2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:24.760
we become friends.

2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:27.960
We become sisters.

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:36.840
GAMORA: Come on.

2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:40.680
We can stop him.

2:06:48.760 --> 2:06:50.120
TONY: Come on, buddy,
wake up!

2:06:50.200 --> 2:06:52.120
-That's my man.

2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:55.080
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

2:06:58.600 --> 2:06:59.800
What happened?

2:06:59.960 --> 2:07:02.080
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:03.120
You'll see.

2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:26.600
What's he been doing?

2:07:28.520 --> 2:07:29.920
Absolutely nothing.

2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:33.560
STEVE: Where are the stones?

2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:35.760
Somewhere under all this.

2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:39.360
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:41.280
So, we keep it that way.

2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:42.840
You know it's a trap, right?

2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.320
Yeah.

2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:45.840
I don't much care.

2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:47.600
Good.

2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:51.040
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:02.800
Let's kill him
properly this time.

2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:15.120
You could not live
with your own failure.

2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:18.440
Where did that bring you?

2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:23.280
Back to me.

2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:29.520
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2:08:30.280 --> 2:08:32.680
the other half would thrive.

2:08:32.840 --> 2:08:34.160
But you've shown me...

2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:37.080
that's impossible.

2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:42.320
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:43.960
there will always be those

2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:47.680
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:49.680
They will resist.

2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:52.120
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:54.600
I'm thankful.

2:08:56.760 --> 2:08:58.520
Because now...

2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:00.840
I know what I must do.

2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:04.240
I will shred this universe...

2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:06.440
down to its last atom.

2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:08.920
And then...

2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:11.400
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:14.320
create a new one...

2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:16.720
teeming with life...

2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:18.760
that knows not
what it has lost...

2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:21.280
but only
what it has been given.

2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:25.800
A grateful universe.

2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:27.760
Born out of blood.

2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:29.600
They'll never know it.

2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:33.720
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:49.600
See you
on the other side, man.

2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.960
ANT-MAN: Hang on! I'm coming!

2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:25.240
Yeah!

2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:41.680
Oh, hey.

2:10:41.840 --> 2:10:43.560
I know you.

2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:47.480
Father...

2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:49.640
I have the stones.

2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:50.720
What?

2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:53.040
GAMORA: Stop.

2:10:58.240 --> 2:10:59.640
You're betraying us?

2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:06.960
You don't have to do this.

2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:12.280
I am this.

2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:14.360
No, you're not.

2:11:14.840 --> 2:11:16.720
You've seen what we become.

2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:25.000
Nebula, listen to her.

2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:27.360
You can change.

2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:35.520
He won't let me.

2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:37.880
No!

2:11:57.520 --> 2:11:58.920
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:16.840
FRIDAY: Boss, wake up!

2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:09.440
I knew it!

2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:34.640
In all my years of conquest...

2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:37.680
violence...

2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:40.720
slaughter...

2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:44.240
it was never personal.

2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:48.920
But I'll tell you now...

2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:54.720
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2:14:54.800 --> 2:14:57.200
annoying little planet...

2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:01.120
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.640
very, very much.

2:16:07.920 --> 2:16:09.440
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2:16:15.480 --> 2:16:17.760
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:23.200
On your left.

2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:50.160
Is that everyone?

2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:52.520
What? You wanted more?
