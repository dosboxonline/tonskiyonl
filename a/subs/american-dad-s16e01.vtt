WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:07.132
So, Danuta, you still haven't
said how you and Marco met.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.218
Oh, no. Here we go.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.971
Well, Marco here is the reigning champion

00:13.055 --> 00:16.558
on a certain quiz show
on Langley Public Radio.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.393
Oh, you mean Oo Oo, I Know That?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.728
A-ding ding dong.

00:19.811 --> 00:23.357
When they asked him
who his favorite philosopher was,

00:23.440 --> 00:26.777
he said, "I can't remember."

00:27.194 --> 00:28.987
His wit was bone-dry,

00:29.071 --> 00:31.448
but I was quite the opposite.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.287
Okay, soup. This time... you're mine.

00:38.497 --> 00:42.417
Ow! That sneaky stuff
just falls off the spoon so fast!

00:42.501 --> 00:45.087
Babe, remember, flip your spoon over

00:45.170 --> 00:46.964
so it's like a little bowl.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.008
Oh! Like a little soup bowl

00:50.092 --> 00:51.218
-on a stick!
-On a stick.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.136
Yes, Jeff. Very good, Jeff.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.888
And how did you two meet?

00:54.972 --> 00:57.808
Oh, it's so hard to recall.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.602
I fell into the touch tank
at the aquarium!

01:00.686 --> 01:02.104
Hayley pulled me out.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.605
Oh, that's right.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.482
We're actually going to a benefit

01:05.566 --> 01:07.276
at the aquarium with Johanna this...

01:07.359 --> 01:09.319
Johanna Gurney-Schaffner?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.738
The host of This Way or That
on Langley Public Radio?

01:11.822 --> 01:13.115
What! You hang out with her?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.284
Oh, she's a dear friend.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.786
We actually went to the new
AlmÃ³dovar film with her

01:17.870 --> 01:18.912
just last night.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.873
Ah! Have you seen it?

01:20.956 --> 01:24.126
Oh, I really wanted to,
but Jeff kinda likes to watch

01:24.209 --> 01:25.752
the same movie over and over,

01:25.836 --> 01:27.713
so right now most nights we're watching

01:27.796 --> 01:30.340
The Land Before Time:
The Secret of Saurus Rock.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.759
Hayley has to explain a lot of it to me,

01:32.843 --> 01:35.345
but I'm this close to understanding

01:35.429 --> 01:37.222
that dragons couldn't actually talk.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.515
Dinosaurs.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.142
"Dino-snaurs."

01:44.021 --> 01:46.690
Good morning, USA

01:46.857 --> 01:50.277
I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:50.360 --> 01:53.113
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:53.363 --> 01:57.242
And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race

01:59.745 --> 02:02.789
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:02.873 --> 02:05.167
Good morning, USA

02:05.250 --> 02:06.251
Ah!

02:08.003 --> 02:10.881
Good morning, USA

02:16.762 --> 02:18.764
- Marco!
- Polo!

02:18.847 --> 02:20.015
- What?
- What?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.976
Wait just one minute.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.065
You were thinking about
Danuta's smarty-pants boyfriend!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.858
Jeff, I love you. I just...

02:29.942 --> 02:32.027
I can't even remember the last time

02:32.110 --> 02:34.321
we had an intelligent
conversation about anything!

02:34.404 --> 02:36.949
We talked for hours about Mad Men!

02:37.032 --> 02:38.784
Because I had to keep explaining

02:38.867 --> 02:40.285
that you didn't have to be scared,

02:40.369 --> 02:42.120
because the men weren't mad at you!

02:42.204 --> 02:43.956
Well, maybe you should
watch it with Narco.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.791
-Marco.
-Polo!

02:45.874 --> 02:47.251
Oh, my God! Why are you so dumb!

02:48.919 --> 02:51.547
Jeff, I'm sorry. I, I just got frustrated.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.590
-Where are you going?
-Out!

02:53.674 --> 02:54.883
Jeff, those are my pants.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.637
I know! I happen to, um...

02:58.720 --> 03:01.348
like the way they make my butt look!

03:03.642 --> 03:06.645
Jeff! Lookin' good!

03:09.565 --> 03:13.777
Oh, man, what if Hayley leaves me
because I'm too dumb for her?

03:13.861 --> 03:15.904
Who's gonna tie my shoes?

03:15.988 --> 03:18.073
Hey. Jeffy-boy!

03:18.156 --> 03:20.075
What up, man? Little moonlight stroll?

03:20.158 --> 03:22.578
Mr. S? Why are you out so late?

03:22.661 --> 03:25.497
Collectin' critters.
Dr. Weitzman needs animals

03:25.581 --> 03:27.708
for a new experiment
he's doing at the CIA.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.293
The agent that brings in the most

03:29.376 --> 03:31.378
gets to go to McDonald's in a limo!

03:31.461 --> 03:32.796
Whoa!

03:32.880 --> 03:35.549
Say, Roger was helping me,
but he quit on me.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.135
Got bit trying to nab
a copperhead snake and just went

03:38.218 --> 03:40.512
straight to the emergency room,
like a quitter.

03:40.596 --> 03:41.597
You wanna help me out?

03:44.099 --> 03:46.810
Mr. S, can I talk to you about something?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.187
Not if I turn on the radio!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.523
Critter!

03:51.607 --> 03:54.067
This Way or That is made possible

03:54.151 --> 03:56.612
by the Arthur and Elaine T.
McKennon Foundation...

03:56.695 --> 03:57.779
Get back here, you little...

03:57.863 --> 03:59.406
...creating a brighter generation

03:59.489 --> 04:00.949
through the power of public radio...

04:01.033 --> 04:02.075
You're coming with me.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.620
...and SmutPile.com.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.496
Check it out. Stray dog.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.083
Can you change the station?

04:10.167 --> 04:13.378
This is that Jo-hannis
Grundy Shniffshnaff lady

04:13.462 --> 04:14.922
Hayley loves so much.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.466
Ugh! Yeah, I hate this nerd shit, too.

04:17.549 --> 04:20.052
That nerd Francine
must've been driving my car.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.513
Let's listen to some Stern!

04:22.596 --> 04:24.306
A lotta people don't know this,

04:24.389 --> 04:27.809
but I was high every day
of shooting City Slickers.

04:27.893 --> 04:31.730
I'm of course talking about
Daniel Stern's autobiography on Audible.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.275
Also, Jack Palance was so strong.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.406
Well, Mister...

04:41.490 --> 04:42.741
Pastafocaccia.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.160
You seem to have fully recovered
from your snakebite.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.204
So that just leaves the small matter of...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.997
uh, the bill!

04:49.831 --> 04:53.460
Sweet child o' mine!
Why is it so darn much, Doc?!

04:53.544 --> 04:56.004
Because antivenom is scarce.

04:56.088 --> 04:59.049
Yep, if someone went out right now

04:59.132 --> 05:01.218
and harvested venom from poisonous snakes,

05:01.301 --> 05:03.262
which is what antivenom is made from,

05:03.345 --> 05:05.639
they could make quite the pretty penny.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.267
-Why are you telling me this?
-I'm a doctor!

05:08.350 --> 05:11.854
I'm all about that sweet
money-money-money-money...

05:11.937 --> 05:13.897
money-money-money!

05:13.981 --> 05:15.232
Hmm.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.860
"Money, money, money, money," you say?

05:17.943 --> 05:19.361
No, like this...

05:19.444 --> 05:21.113
Money-money-money!

05:21.196 --> 05:23.407
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah.
Money-money-money-money!

05:23.490 --> 05:25.033
Money-money-money!

05:25.117 --> 05:27.870
Money-money-money!

05:27.953 --> 05:29.413
Now Eskimo kisses!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.290
Money-money-money!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.296
Wait here while I run these
bad boys on down to Dr. Dubs.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.132
What kind of experiment
is the the doctor working on, anyway?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.134
Uh, some kind of experimental surgery

05:42.217 --> 05:44.178
to increase intelligence or some crap.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.180
Do you think he could do it to me?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.306
Dumb guy like you?

05:47.389 --> 05:48.932
I can see why you'd be interested.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.809
But he still hasn't perfected
the operation.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.186
Most of these animals will end up

05:52.269 --> 05:53.979
dimmer than an Amish Christmas tree.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.150
I like that you screeched
at my joke, wise old owl.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.569
You I might just keep for myself.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.157
Sure is spooky here after dark.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.660
Ahh! Babadook!

06:09.411 --> 06:12.831
I wish! It's just stupid old me.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.917
I was making ramen on my hotplate,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.668
and the dang pot fell on my head.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.421
Oh. Phew! What are you doing here?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.089
My girlfriend kicked me out!

06:21.173 --> 06:23.926
Aw, that's awful, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.887
Take it from me, kid.
Don't ever be in a relationship

06:26.970 --> 06:28.430
with someone smarter than you.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.015
It won't last.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.311
Dr. Wishbone...

06:34.394 --> 06:36.980
I'd like to volunteer
for your a-speriment.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.108
Oh, I would love to have
a human test subject,

06:40.192 --> 06:41.860
but you should know

06:41.944 --> 06:44.238
there's a 99% chance
you'll end up brain-dead.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.449
Uh, 99 out of a million?

06:47.533 --> 06:50.244
I think I'll take my chances.

06:56.834 --> 06:57.960
Tell you what, Screechy...

06:58.210 --> 07:01.380
maybe the move is to track down
this beautiful sicko.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.090
Score ten dogs at once.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.302
Dad, have you seen Jeff?
He never came home last night.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.929
Oh, yeah, he volunteered himself

07:09.012 --> 07:11.306
for a deadly experimental
surgery at the CIA.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.934
What! Why didn't you stop him?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.894
I guess I don't care
whether he lives or dies.

07:15.978 --> 07:16.979
Ugh!

07:17.980 --> 07:20.023
-Hoo!
-Jeff.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.114
Stop this atrocity at once!

07:27.197 --> 07:29.074
Oh, Hayley! I'm glad you're here.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.077
As Jeff's legal guardian,
you need to sign this release

07:32.160 --> 07:33.704
before I can do the operation.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.832
You must be suckin'
the glass if you think

07:36.915 --> 07:39.751
I am gonna give Jeff permission
to go through with this...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.920
"Intelligence Enhancement"?

07:42.379 --> 07:43.964
Out of curiosity, has this worked

07:44.047 --> 07:45.757
on any of your test animals?

07:45.841 --> 07:48.969
There's one goose that's now in Mensa.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.764
Did I get it right this time, Doc?

07:52.848 --> 07:54.850
Oh, if it isn't Babe.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.727
Hopefully here to stop me

07:56.810 --> 07:59.313
from doing this super-dangerous thing.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.481
-He's all yours, Doc!
-Oh.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.463
Hayley?

08:25.047 --> 08:27.591
Dr. Weitzman? Smart Goose?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.843
-Did it work?
-Let's find out.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.095
Which of the little people

08:32.179 --> 08:35.307
is wearing his hospital gown correctly?

08:35.641 --> 08:37.684
This one.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.312
Seems to have had a bit
of a sartorial snafu.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.190
- Hmm?
- He's taken his "privates" public,

08:43.273 --> 08:44.316
so to speak.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.777
One might even call it an IPO...

08:46.860 --> 08:49.238
an Ignominious Penile Ostentation.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.200
You can honk that again, Squawky.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.661
Now, he will need to avoid marijuana,

08:55.744 --> 08:57.913
which could dull the effects
of the procedure.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.374
I can also tell you
that is a fake diploma.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.000
He's not wrong!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.631
Ah, Mr. Fischer, welcome back!

09:07.714 --> 09:10.425
Shall I bring for you
extra children's menus,

09:10.509 --> 09:13.470
so you may attempt the maze
as many times as you like?

09:13.554 --> 09:14.596
Merci, non.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.473
Une bouteille de ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape

09:16.557 --> 09:18.100
et du pain pour la table, s'il vous plaÃ®t.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.978
You have exposed my secret shame.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.647
I am not French,
nor do I speak the language.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.943
Did Jeff take a ten-gallon
Gingko enema this morning or what?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.069
'Cause he seems, like,

09:29.152 --> 09:31.196
a billion times smarter
than he used to be.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.198
I know! Isn't it great?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.325
Per te, amore mio.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.786
Say what you will about Seurat.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.080
No one can accuse his art of being...

09:40.163 --> 09:41.248
pointless.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.335
That is so witty, it's almost funny.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.130
You know, Johanna is hosting
a small fundraiser

09:48.213 --> 09:50.841
for the McKennon Foundation
at her lake house this weekend.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.676
You guys should come.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.804
As they say in ReykjavÃ­k...

10:00.475 --> 10:02.394
What he said.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.149
So, by now, Barry's going back

10:07.232 --> 10:08.734
to the Steve Madden a third time...

10:08.817 --> 10:09.860
Shh, shh, shut up!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.570
Your story sucks, and I hear a rattler.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.450
Oingo boingo! We got cornbread!

10:16.825 --> 10:19.036
Here. Take some clackers
and work that string bean

10:19.119 --> 10:20.370
on outta there.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.289
What! Why would I do that!

10:22.372 --> 10:24.166
Because I'm Chazz Babylon,

10:24.249 --> 10:26.251
Speculative Venom Harvester.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.461
And you're my bag man.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.880
You told me you were Chico Dungaree,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.757
Former Twisted Sister Roadie,

10:31.840 --> 10:33.717
and that we were just
going on a nature walk!

10:33.800 --> 10:36.220
Chazz Babylon is a pathological liar.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.471
Now get clackin'!

10:37.554 --> 10:38.680
I will not!

10:38.764 --> 10:41.058
The world needs antivenom, Steve.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.768
Think of how many lives we'll save.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.437
All right. We can try.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.106
Okay, now first we gotta
clack him outta that bush.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.735
Now hold up a second.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.070
I wanna make sure we got a good one.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.323
Ow! It's him! And he nipped me!

10:56.406 --> 10:58.075
-Oh, my God!
-I got nipped!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.409
Quick, grab his tail!

11:01.203 --> 11:03.539
Oh, he's mad now! Oh, he nipped me again!

11:03.622 --> 11:06.166
-I got nipped! You get nipped?
-Oh! Yow! I got nipped!

11:06.250 --> 11:07.292
-I got nipped!
-I'm gettin' nipped!

11:07.376 --> 11:08.710
-Oh! Ow! Ow!
-Ow!

11:08.794 --> 11:10.128
I'm gettin' nipped
a whole bunch right now!

11:10.212 --> 11:11.421
Ow! Let's bag this sucker!

11:11.588 --> 11:13.382
Get him in there! Ahh!

11:13.507 --> 11:15.884
I'm trying!

11:19.388 --> 11:21.014
We did it, Steve.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.561
Oh, my God.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.021
He doesn't have his clackers. He's doomed!

11:31.984 --> 11:33.861
Wife. Noun.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.822
A woman who regrets a decision.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.910
What then of "husband"?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.872
The man who begets her derision.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.126
More snaps! More snaps for you!

11:49.918 --> 11:52.421
Jeff, we simply have to have you

11:52.504 --> 11:54.464
as a contestant on Oo Oo, I Know That.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.466
Johanna's going to be a guest panelist.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.177
What do you say, Johanna?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.386
Certainly.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.513
So long as he helps me with this devil

12:01.597 --> 12:03.682
of a New Yorker caption contest.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.184
Any suggestions?

12:05.309 --> 12:06.518
Hmm.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.479
How about, "I've heard of a bull market,

12:09.563 --> 12:10.856
"but this is ridiculous"?

12:12.649 --> 12:16.361
Or, "Of course on the day
I wear my red tie."

12:16.445 --> 12:19.990
Or, "Everybody has been
saying the new guy is horny."

12:20.282 --> 12:22.034
"Think that belt is real leather?"

12:22.534 --> 12:24.620
"I heard this place had fresh beef,

12:24.703 --> 12:26.622
"but this is ridiculous!"

12:29.833 --> 12:31.418
Now you do one, babe.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.630
Uh...

12:35.506 --> 12:37.841
Business... bull?

12:38.509 --> 12:40.093
- Ugh. That's just...
- That doesn't quite connect.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.428
-Nice try, but...
-Very, very bad.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.482
What the... A weed gummy?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.109
You know that could affect my treatment!

12:56.193 --> 12:58.487
Oh, my God! Are you trying to...

12:58.570 --> 12:59.988
sabotage me?

13:00.072 --> 13:02.449
Playing "Rabbitage" by Weird Al.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.077
I'll nab cabbage
And do my...

13:05.160 --> 13:06.328
Alexa, off!

13:06.411 --> 13:08.622
You know, Johanna was right about you.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.083
You are pathologically insecure!

13:11.166 --> 13:13.836
What... You've been talking
to Johanna about us?

13:13.919 --> 13:16.505
First you risked my life
to make me smarter,

13:16.588 --> 13:19.424
now you nearly kill me
trying to dumb me back down?

13:19.508 --> 13:20.884
I'm sorry, Jeff!

13:20.968 --> 13:23.512
I, I was scared you were getting
too smart for me and...

13:23.595 --> 13:24.805
But I should thank you.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.723
Because now that I am smart,

13:26.807 --> 13:30.185
I finally see what
a selfish person you are.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.104
No, Jeff, please don't see that!

13:32.229 --> 13:33.772
I never cared you weren't

13:33.856 --> 13:36.066
the most erudite person in the world.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.237
But I can't be with someone
who's downright flagitious!

13:44.032 --> 13:46.034
-F-L...
-It means "villainous"!

13:46.118 --> 13:48.078
I know what it means!

13:54.918 --> 13:56.253
Well, Screechy, he did it.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.172
He won the Tournament of Champions.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.256
Hoo.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.008
Don't make me say his name, Screech.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.218
Hayley, honey?

14:03.302 --> 14:05.804
The ice-cream truck just came by.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.057
I got you one of those
Sonic the Hedgehogs.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.226
Thanks, Mom.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.978
You've just seemed so sad

14:13.061 --> 14:15.439
these last few months since Jeff left.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.482
No, we've both moved on.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.067
He's with Johanna now,

14:19.151 --> 14:22.738
and I'm happy
with my new boyfriend... Myron.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.407
Duh! Hey, Hayley! Look it!

14:25.532 --> 14:28.368
I knocked it right outta
its nest with a rock

14:28.452 --> 14:30.954
from all the way a long ways!

14:31.038 --> 14:32.539
Like...

14:32.706 --> 14:35.542
Myron! You're gonna get West Nile again!

14:35.626 --> 14:38.670
Aww! You got a Sonic bar? Gimme!

14:39.922 --> 14:41.882
Let's go to the old tire factory

14:41.965 --> 14:44.468
and whip this bird against the big rock!

14:51.183 --> 14:53.977
I wish Stan would take me places.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.438
Rock-throw!

14:56.522 --> 14:57.773
Million points!

14:58.023 --> 15:00.859
Hey, Hayley! You see that?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.736
Yes, Myron. Very good, Myron.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.614
I'll nab cabbage and...

15:06.114 --> 15:08.116
Gouda Tenuta, what's nuts?

15:08.617 --> 15:10.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.454
Marco's been missing for how long?

15:14.665 --> 15:16.834
Listen, I've been doing a lot of research.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.378
Every male winner of
the Tournament of Champions

15:19.461 --> 15:21.588
has gone missing a few weeks later.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.132
And it has something to do
with the McKennon Foundation.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.677
Oh, Hayley, conspiracy theories

15:26.760 --> 15:29.096
are the refuge of the dispossessed.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.889
Kava root ristretto?

15:30.973 --> 15:34.226
Jeff, please. I think you
may be in some kind of danger.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.103
Only of losing my patience!

15:36.311 --> 15:40.065
Clearly, you've transmuted your guilt
over destroying our relationship

15:40.148 --> 15:41.942
into this absurd fairy tale.

15:42.401 --> 15:45.571
Well, enough. It is over between us.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.123
Forget about her, lover.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.585
A brighter future awaits us.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.545
Let's play at puns.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.256
"Air Hare." Ten letters.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.258
Hmm. Kite Rabbit?

16:06.341 --> 16:09.469
Close. But the answer is actually...

16:09.553 --> 16:11.305
Ether bunny!

16:11.388 --> 16:15.642
Come now, Jeff. Destiny calls.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.523
Wakey, wakey! Milk some snakeys!

16:21.607 --> 16:24.026
Time to get out there again,
right back on the horse.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.235
Clack clack clack!

16:25.319 --> 16:27.863
You must be suckin' the glass

16:27.946 --> 16:29.948
if you think I'm going back out with you.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.658
You were never out to save lives.

16:31.742 --> 16:32.993
You just wanted to make money.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.912
It may have started out
being about the money,

16:34.995 --> 16:36.330
but not anymore.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.290
Well, maybe a little.
I did sink quite a bit

16:38.373 --> 16:39.958
into having all these T-shirts made.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.629
But otherwise,
now it's all about saving lives.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.507
I won't rest until every snakebite victim

16:46.590 --> 16:48.300
has the antivenom they need!

16:49.635 --> 16:50.636
Ahh!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.138
Ahh!

16:53.931 --> 16:55.015
Ahh!

16:55.390 --> 16:56.433
Ahh!

16:56.517 --> 16:57.726
Ahh!

16:57.809 --> 16:59.061
Ahh!

17:02.105 --> 17:03.106
Ahh!

17:03.190 --> 17:05.275
I'm afraid you've single-handedly

17:05.359 --> 17:08.028
depleted the world's
entire supply of antivenom.

17:08.153 --> 17:11.240
Many have died, and now you will, too.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.909
Clack's all... folks.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.496
My Chazz!

17:17.663 --> 17:19.581
No!

17:21.375 --> 17:24.837
The Meisterzucht awakes!

17:24.920 --> 17:26.296
Where am I?

17:26.588 --> 17:29.758
At the threshold of a new age.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.260
Welcome...

17:31.343 --> 17:34.012
to the McKennon Foundation!

17:34.680 --> 17:35.973
Why are you doing this?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.851
Why, to create a brighter generation,

17:38.934 --> 17:42.563
free of dumdums,
dingdongs, and dingalings.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.315
We use Oo Oo, I Know That

17:45.399 --> 17:48.944
to identify intellects
of the highest genetic caliber,

17:49.027 --> 17:51.488
then harvest their seed to be...

17:51.572 --> 17:53.532
disseminated...

17:55.284 --> 17:58.412
Pun, uh, very much intended.

17:58.495 --> 18:01.415
...to fertility clinics the world over!

18:01.498 --> 18:06.587
And you, Jeff, you are the most
smartest one of all!

18:06.670 --> 18:08.338
Der Meisterzucht!

18:08.422 --> 18:10.591
The Master Stud!

18:10.674 --> 18:12.176
Commence milking!

18:16.972 --> 18:19.266
You might think
this would feel good,

18:19.349 --> 18:21.393
but it's agony!

18:26.815 --> 18:29.401
Ready the Meisterzucht for harvest!

18:29.484 --> 18:32.279
Wait! No! No! Listen!
My genes are useless to you.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.282
My intelligence stems
from biomedical intervention!

18:35.365 --> 18:37.618
Uh, you don't think we already
tried that old chestnut...

18:37.701 --> 18:39.912
My balls!

18:40.954 --> 18:43.123
Milk the Meisterzucht!

18:46.793 --> 18:48.712
Yah, Myron! Yah!

18:51.340 --> 18:52.799
Myron! Attack!

18:53.175 --> 18:54.760
Rock! Bird! Bird!

18:54.843 --> 18:56.220
Rock! Rat!

18:58.972 --> 19:00.390
Let's get outta here.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.774
You came for me.

19:08.857 --> 19:11.109
Even though it means now you'll die, too.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.569
What can I say?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.863
I think my problem all along has been,

19:14.947 --> 19:18.325
when it comes to you,
I'm just a great big dummy.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.954
We gotta think of a way out of here.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.497
But those are some of
the most intelligent people

19:23.580 --> 19:24.915
in the world out there.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.291
We'll never outsmart them!

19:26.375 --> 19:29.545
No. But we may be able to outstupid them.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.422
I need to be dumb again,
so I can think up a plan

19:32.506 --> 19:34.591
so stupid they could never expect it.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.593
How? We don't have any weed!

19:37.010 --> 19:39.972
The answer's as easy as autolobotomy.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.647
Have you ever wondered
what the colors on maps mean?

19:48.897 --> 19:50.983
They gotta mean something.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.651
Quick, what's your stupid plan?

19:54.570 --> 19:56.572
Since Vaseline is clear,

19:56.655 --> 19:58.740
once we cover ourselves in it...

19:59.449 --> 20:01.451
we become absolutely,

20:01.535 --> 20:04.204
one-million-percent invisible.

20:04.496 --> 20:07.124
Oh, wow. This is stupid.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.834
Seize them!

20:14.464 --> 20:17.009
Ugh! They're too damn slippery!

20:17.926 --> 20:19.344
Whoo!

20:26.018 --> 20:28.061
The Spank Tank!

20:28.729 --> 20:30.689
All our precious seed!

20:40.365 --> 20:42.242
C'mon, Snugglesaurus.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.870
We can still make it to the Great Valley.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.079
You know what I'm wondering?

20:46.163 --> 20:47.831
If we maybe should've tried to save

20:47.915 --> 20:49.208
those other men in that basement?

20:49.291 --> 20:50.501
No.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.836
Do you think all the dino-snaurs
stayed friends

20:52.920 --> 20:54.671
when they were done shooting the movie?

20:54.755 --> 20:57.007
Babe, don't ever change.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.468
Have a great night!
