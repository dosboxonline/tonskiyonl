<i>Johnny.</i>

02:57.458 --> 03:00.357
<i>Harry!</i>

03:04.125 --> 03:06.285
How are you?

03:13.125 --> 03:15.785
Hello?

03:15.891 --> 03:18.222
Yes, this is Harold Angel.

03:18.325 --> 03:20.587
Yep, middle initial "R,"
just like in the phone book.

03:20.691 --> 03:25.318
Excuse me? Winesap.

03:25.425 --> 03:28.880
Herman Winesap
of Winesap and Mackintosh.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.390
Hold on a second.

03:33.691 --> 03:37.056
Okay, Winesap...

03:37.158 --> 03:39.488
of Winesap and Mackintosh.

03:39.591 --> 03:41.058
Okay, I got it.

03:43.458 --> 03:46.856
Of course I know
what an attorney is.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.857
Yeah, it's like a lawyer,
only the bills are bigger.

03:52.791 --> 03:55.349
Sure, I'll hold. Asshole.

04:02.457 --> 04:04.947
Mr. Winesap, yeah,
Harold Angel.

04:07.524 --> 04:10.356
Well, yeah, I could be free.

04:10.457 --> 04:12.481
Well, would this be with your firm?

04:16.091 --> 04:17.853
Okay, give me that again.

04:19.958 --> 04:22.221
Louis.

04:22.325 --> 04:24.224
How do you spell that?

04:25.791 --> 04:28.849
Cyphre. Okay.
What is it, foreign?

04:28.958 --> 04:32.823
A foreigner? Is your client
a foreign gentleman?

04:34.225 --> 04:35.691
Okay.

04:35.791 --> 04:39.281
Well, Mr. Winesap, could you give me
a few more details?

04:41.658 --> 04:43.784
Okay.
No, I know the place.

04:45.724 --> 04:47.884
Well, it's a long way up,
but I can be there.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.691
Hallelujah!

05:09.891 --> 05:12.949
Permit me to be transmittable,
hallelujah.

05:13.058 --> 05:16.547
Permit me to be reincarnatable,
hallelujah.

05:16.658 --> 05:20.251
Permit me to be reproducible,
hallelujah.

05:21.125 --> 05:25.524
For His kingdom is yours,
today, right now.

05:25.624 --> 05:30.683
Hallelujah. Follow me.
Follow me through his paths.

05:30.791 --> 05:34.350
Hallelujah. I want you to show right now
how much you love God.

05:34.457 --> 05:37.549
I want you to show
as your tithe.

05:37.658 --> 05:40.489
I want you to open up your hearts
and open up your wallets.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.990
And open up your purses.
And open up your pockets.

05:44.091 --> 05:46.489
And give it up.
Praise the Lord.

05:46.591 --> 05:50.957
Somebody's been talkin' about me, about
I've been riding around in a Cadillac.

05:51.058 --> 05:53.650
If you love me,
and you wanna give to me...

05:53.758 --> 05:56.089
then I should be
in a Rolls Royce.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.651
Let's hear it, Brother. Let's go. Yes!

06:00.758 --> 06:05.089
Hey! Hey! Come on.

06:05.192 --> 06:08.488
- Mr. Angel?
- Yeah.

06:08.591 --> 06:11.786
Herman Winesap.

06:11.891 --> 06:13.983
Would you come
with me, please?

06:26.825 --> 06:28.292
An unfortunate husband...

06:28.391 --> 06:31.517
of one of Pastor John's flock
took a gun to his head.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.523
Most unpleasant.

06:34.424 --> 06:37.017
Mr. Angel? Please?

06:59.357 --> 07:01.257
Mr. Angel.

07:01.357 --> 07:07.053
Allow me to introduce my client,
Monsieur Louis Cyphre.

07:07.158 --> 07:09.647
Hiya. Harry Angel.

07:09.758 --> 07:12.191
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Angel.

07:14.192 --> 07:19.125
I don't want to appear rude or impolite,
but do you have any I.D., before we begin?

07:19.225 --> 07:22.316
Sure. Yeah. Here.

07:22.424 --> 07:25.391
Let me see what I got here.

07:25.491 --> 07:27.583
How's that?

07:37.624 --> 07:40.523
Nothing personal. It's just
that I'm a little overcautious.

07:40.624 --> 07:44.250
- You know how these things are.
- Oh, I know.

07:44.357 --> 07:48.814
So, how did you hear about me?

07:56.291 --> 07:58.918
I guess you guys just looked
in the phone book, huh?

08:02.724 --> 08:04.657
Usually that's what happens.

08:04.758 --> 08:07.089
Because my name is Angel.
It's under A's.

08:07.192 --> 08:09.385
People--
You know, people are lazy.

08:09.491 --> 08:11.458
They flick through.
They see the first name in the book.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.548
- Johnny Favorite.
- Excuse me?

08:14.658 --> 08:18.057
Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?

08:18.158 --> 08:21.249
Remember the name Johnny?
No, I don't think so.

08:21.357 --> 08:24.756
- You never knew him?
- Am I supposed to know him?

08:24.858 --> 08:27.848
He was a crooner before the war.
Quite famous in his way.

08:29.891 --> 08:32.687
Well, I'll tell ya,
Mr. "Cyphre," you know, I--

08:33.457 --> 08:34.856
Mr. Cyphre.

08:35.791 --> 08:37.347
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

08:37.457 --> 08:43.322
Mr. Cyphres. I usually don't get
involved in anything really heavy.

08:43.424 --> 08:47.585
I usually handle
small-time stuff:

08:47.691 --> 08:51.249
insurance jobs, divorces,
things of that nature.

08:51.357 --> 08:55.121
I get lucky,
sometimes I handle people.

08:55.224 --> 08:59.180
But I don't know no,
you know, crooners...

08:59.291 --> 09:01.781
or anybody famous, you know?

09:01.891 --> 09:05.915
- His real name was Liebling.
- I don't--

09:07.224 --> 09:09.316
I don't know
any Liebling either.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.323
So what is it you guys
want from me?

09:11.424 --> 09:14.152
- Does this man owe you money?
- Not quite.

09:14.257 --> 09:17.383
I gave Johnny some help
at the beginning of his career.

09:17.491 --> 09:21.686
So were you, like, his--
his agent?

09:21.791 --> 09:26.724
No, no, no.
Nothing so--

09:26.825 --> 09:29.883
Monsieur Cyphre has a contract.

09:29.991 --> 09:33.754
Certain collateral was involved, to be
forfeited in the event of his death.

09:33.858 --> 09:36.290
You're losin' me a little bit.
Are we talkin' about a guy who's dead?

09:36.391 --> 09:39.483
No, he was drafted in '43.
North Africa.

09:39.591 --> 09:43.047
Special Entertainment Services.
There was an attack.

09:43.157 --> 09:45.351
He was badly injured
about the head and face.

09:45.457 --> 09:49.686
- He had--
- Amnesia, I think you call it.

09:49.791 --> 09:52.952
- Shell shock?
- Shell shock. Yes.

09:53.058 --> 09:56.388
- I know how that feels.
- Why? Were you in the services?

09:56.491 --> 09:58.424
Yes, I was in
for a short period of time.

09:58.524 --> 10:03.787
But I got a little fucked up real quick.
Excuse my language.

10:03.891 --> 10:05.824
And they shipped me
back home...

10:05.925 --> 10:08.221
and I sort of missed
the whole shebang.

10:08.324 --> 10:11.450
You know, the war, the medals,
the whole nine yards.

10:11.558 --> 10:13.525
And I guess you could say
I was lucky.

10:13.624 --> 10:17.489
Well, Johnny wasn't so lucky.
He returned home a virtual zombie.

10:17.591 --> 10:22.320
Favorite's friends had him transferred
to a private hospital upstate.

10:22.424 --> 10:26.221
There was some sort of radical
psychiatric treatment involved.

10:26.324 --> 10:29.086
Favorite's lawyers
had the power of attorney to--

10:29.191 --> 10:32.590
Pay the bills, things like that.
But you know how these things are.

10:32.691 --> 10:35.419
He remained a vegetable,
and my contract was never honored.

10:35.524 --> 10:37.150
I see.

10:37.257 --> 10:40.520
I don't want to sound mercenary
or anything, but you must understand...

10:40.624 --> 10:43.682
that my interest in Johnny
is only in finding out if he's alive...

10:43.791 --> 10:45.985
or if he's dead.

10:46.090 --> 10:50.547
Each year my office receives
a signed affidavit confirming...

10:50.658 --> 10:54.091
that Johnny Liebling is indeed
among the living.

10:54.191 --> 10:57.056
Until this last weekend,
when quite by chance...

10:57.157 --> 11:01.955
Monsieur Cyphre and I were in the vicinity
of the hospital just outside Poughkeepsie.

11:02.057 --> 11:06.354
We decided to check for ourselves
but were given misleading information.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.185
- Yeah, the runaround.
- Yes. I didn't want to cause a scene.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.485
I hate to have any sort of a fuss.

11:12.591 --> 11:14.922
So I thought perhaps you could...

11:15.024 --> 11:18.480
subtly, in a more quiet manner--

11:18.591 --> 11:21.148
- You want me to check it out.
- Check it out.

11:25.124 --> 11:26.557
Okay. Yeah.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.315
It's funny. I have a feeling
I've met you before.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.848
I don't know.
I don't think so.

11:47.858 --> 11:50.757
<i>Do you by chance remember
the name Johnny Favorite?</i>

11:56.291 --> 11:58.690
<i>His real name was Liebling.</i>

12:02.990 --> 12:08.014
<i>My interest in Johnny is only in finding
out if he's alive or if he's dead.</i>

12:50.825 --> 12:52.553
- May I help you?
- Yes.

12:52.658 --> 12:57.819
My name is Harry Conroy, and I'm
with the National Institute of Health.

12:59.157 --> 13:02.318
Is there anyone in particular
you'd like to see, Mr. Conroy?

13:02.424 --> 13:07.050
The Institute is conducting a survey
of incurable trauma cases...

13:07.157 --> 13:11.181
and I understand you have a patient here
fitting that description.

13:12.157 --> 13:14.886
I'm afraid we can't let you see anyone
without an appointment, sir.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.753
Oh, sure. I appreciate that.
But maybe, you know...

13:16.858 --> 13:20.586
you could check the files
and make sure I'm on the right track.

13:20.691 --> 13:24.180
I don't want to bother
anybody unnecessarily.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.383
Okay? Thank you.

13:27.491 --> 13:31.583
- What's the name of the patient?
- Liebling. Jonathan Liebling.

13:31.691 --> 13:33.987
One moment please.
I will check.

13:37.924 --> 13:40.619
So, was you workin' here
last weekend?

13:40.724 --> 13:42.623
No. Day off.

13:43.658 --> 13:46.954
- Did you do anything nice?
- My sister's wedding.

13:49.457 --> 13:51.447
We did have a Mr. Liebling...

13:51.558 --> 13:53.787
but it says here
he was transferred.

13:53.890 --> 13:55.857
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's what it says here.

13:55.957 --> 14:01.255
- Well, when was that?
- Years ago. December '43.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.688
May I take a look at this?
Thank you.

14:07.024 --> 14:09.491
- Is this recent?
- It's an old file.

14:09.591 --> 14:14.081
It's in ballpoint. You know, they
weren't too big on ballpoint in '43.

14:14.191 --> 14:16.556
- Is that ballpoint?
- Yeah.

14:16.658 --> 14:19.920
Well, I'll be.
They didn't have ballpoints back then?

14:21.090 --> 14:22.989
No.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.683
This here Dr. Fowler...

14:25.791 --> 14:27.690
does he still work here?

14:27.791 --> 14:30.314
Just part-time. He's old.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.758
Thank you.

17:12.457 --> 17:13.980
About time for your evening fix?

17:16.491 --> 17:19.390
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

17:20.156 --> 17:23.681
Through the mail slot.
I'm a private detective.

17:24.457 --> 17:28.185
Breaking and entering is a serious
crime, whoever or whatever you are.

17:28.290 --> 17:31.315
Well, hey, man,
call the police.

17:31.424 --> 17:34.357
Which you won't do in case
they discover your little opium den...

17:34.457 --> 17:36.855
you got in the icebox there.

17:44.391 --> 17:48.518
I'm a doctor. I'm perfectly entitled
to keep pharmaceuticals at home.

17:48.623 --> 17:50.920
Hey, look, Doc, tell it
to somebody else, all right?

17:51.024 --> 17:54.752
We're not talkin' about
a Band-Aid and two Bongateen.

17:54.857 --> 17:57.518
- How long you been hooked?
- What do you want of me?

17:57.623 --> 18:00.818
Information about Johnny Liebling.

18:01.591 --> 18:04.648
I vaguely remember treating
a patient of that name many years ago.

18:04.757 --> 18:07.724
Hey, look, Doc,
I'm not foolin' around here.

18:09.790 --> 18:14.383
Either you start giving me some straight
answers, or I'll call the police myself.

18:14.491 --> 18:18.356
I've seen the works cookin' upstairs,
pal, and it ain't Mr. Salk's vaccine.

18:18.457 --> 18:21.549
I remember. He was in detainer
during the war. Neuro case.

18:21.657 --> 18:26.057
No chance of recovery. So we transferred
him to a V.A. hospital in Albany.

18:26.157 --> 18:28.817
Hey, Doc, I hate to shake you up,
but I checked with Albany.

18:28.924 --> 18:32.187
He's not there.
You faked the transfer.

18:32.291 --> 18:34.814
Well, I did that quickly
because he had a visitor recently.

18:34.924 --> 18:37.857
In 12 years, he hadn't had a visitor.

18:37.957 --> 18:40.651
Popular guy, huh?

18:42.590 --> 18:45.217
- Where is he now?
- I honestly don't know.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.518
Look. Come here.

18:47.623 --> 18:50.250
I haven't seen him since
he was a patient in the war.

18:50.357 --> 18:54.722
Look, Doc, you're in a cold sweat.
Look at you.

18:54.824 --> 18:59.019
You can't wait for me to leave here so
you can raid the goodies in the icebox.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.348
Now, the sooner
you get out with it...

19:02.457 --> 19:06.548
the sooner you can shoot yourself
to Palookaville, okay?

19:06.657 --> 19:08.988
I'm gonna ask you again.

19:09.090 --> 19:10.989
Where is he?

19:11.090 --> 19:13.353
I don't know.

19:13.457 --> 19:15.889
Some people came one night
many years ago.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.821
He got in the car with him and
drove away. I never saw him again.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.414
He got into a car?
I thought this guy was a vegetable.

19:21.523 --> 19:25.547
When he first came here, he was
in a coma, but he soon recovered.

19:25.657 --> 19:27.590
But he still suffered
from acute amnesia.

19:28.424 --> 19:32.221
The friends?
Who were the friends?

19:32.324 --> 19:34.586
The gentleman's name was Kelly.
Edward Kelly.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.387
The young lady, I don't know her.

19:37.491 --> 19:40.253
- She stayed in the car.
- Where were they taking him?

19:40.357 --> 19:43.381
I think down south. The man said,
"We're taking him home."

19:44.257 --> 19:46.247
- What was the deal?
- $25,000.

19:46.357 --> 19:47.380
For what?

19:47.491 --> 19:50.356
To maintain the pretense that he was
still a patient in the hospital.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.650
Well, didn't the administration suspect?

19:52.757 --> 19:55.883
But why should they?
I kept the charts up to date...

19:55.990 --> 19:59.424
and no one asks questions
when the bills get paid.

20:00.291 --> 20:03.190
I want you to tell me
about Johnny Liebling.

20:03.291 --> 20:06.724
- What did he look like?
- I have no idea what he looked like.

20:06.824 --> 20:10.848
His face was damaged. He had
extensive facial reconstruction.

20:10.957 --> 20:13.480
He was still in bandages
the day he left.

20:13.590 --> 20:16.114
Tell me about this guy Kelly.

20:16.224 --> 20:19.123
- It's so long. I have only a vague memory.
- Come on.

20:19.224 --> 20:23.282
I can't remember. He was well-dressed.
He had a southern accent.

20:23.391 --> 20:25.290
- I--
- What?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.516
- Truly can't remember.
- All right, Doc. All right.

20:27.623 --> 20:30.147
Hey. We're gonna have
a little lie-down, all right?

20:30.257 --> 20:32.917
I'm gonna go out,
and I'm gonna grab a cheeseburger.

20:33.024 --> 20:37.219
Maybe a few hours cold turkey
will refresh your memory. All right?

20:38.657 --> 20:41.715
Come on.

20:44.324 --> 20:46.756
Watch yourself there.

20:47.857 --> 20:49.881
Okay, Doc. We're gonna
take a little nap now.

20:49.990 --> 20:52.219
Sit your ass down.

20:52.324 --> 20:55.416
I'm gonna clear your mind
a little bit.

20:55.523 --> 20:57.854
I'm gonna go out.
Maybe when I get back...

20:57.957 --> 21:01.220
I'll fix you some goodies
from the icebox, all right?

21:01.324 --> 21:04.882
Listen, you tell me what I want to know,
I'll be out of your hair forever.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.848
<i>Johnny.</i>

21:41.957 --> 21:44.924
<i>Harry. Harry.</i>

21:48.957 --> 21:51.322
<i>Harry.</i>

23:40.690 --> 23:43.486
Hey, I'm back, Doc.
I brought you a little somethin'.

23:48.657 --> 23:50.920
I didn't think you'd want
a cheeseburger and a shake.

25:18.190 --> 25:20.714
- I won't. Bye.
- Bye.

25:20.824 --> 25:23.222
- Hey, Allie.
- Hey, Harry.

25:23.323 --> 25:25.347
That your boyfriend?

25:26.456 --> 25:27.821
- He got a car and everything?
- Yeah.

25:27.924 --> 25:29.857
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.856
- Ohh.
- Bye.

25:31.957 --> 25:34.219
See you later.

26:09.957 --> 26:12.651
- Did you see him?
- No.

26:12.757 --> 26:14.815
- Why not?
- 'Cause it would have been difficult.

26:14.924 --> 26:18.516
- Why?
- Why? 'Cause he's not there.

26:19.757 --> 26:24.554
Your Johnny Favorite walked out of
Sarah Harvest Dodd's 12 years ago...

26:24.657 --> 26:27.749
wearin' his best suit and a new face
wrapped in bandages.

26:27.857 --> 26:30.086
With a headache.

26:30.190 --> 26:34.453
He took off with some guy
called Kelly and a girl.

26:34.557 --> 26:36.922
Do you know this Kelly?

26:38.356 --> 26:40.323
Well, it seems that this guy
Kelly paid off...

26:40.423 --> 26:45.413
some bent doctor called Fowler to
pinch-hit for your guy all these years.

26:45.523 --> 26:48.149
He's been coverin' up
for him ever since.

26:54.757 --> 26:58.884
It looks like our Johnny has found
himself a perfect disappearing act.

26:58.990 --> 27:01.048
It seems so.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.716
You know what they say about slugs.

27:06.623 --> 27:09.055
No, what do they say about slugs?

27:09.156 --> 27:11.953
They always leave slime in their tracks.

27:19.223 --> 27:22.748
- You'll find him.
- No, I won't find him.

27:24.490 --> 27:28.321
'Cause I left out one little detail.

27:28.423 --> 27:34.084
This Dr. Fowler guy ended up dead with
his fuckin' brains blown out all over.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.589
- Fowler?
- Yeah, Fowler.

27:36.690 --> 27:39.384
- Did you kill him?
- No, I didn't kill him.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.389
But the cops might think I did.

27:42.757 --> 27:47.053
Hey, look. I took on $125 a day
missing persons job with you.

27:47.156 --> 27:50.885
Now I'm a murder suspect.
That's it. I'm out.

27:52.023 --> 27:55.980
Such are the hazards
of your profession, Mr. Angel.

27:56.089 --> 27:58.386
If the fee bothers you,
we can have it adjusted.

27:58.490 --> 28:02.014
No, Cyphre, you bother me.
Listen, the closest I ever come...

28:02.123 --> 28:05.420
to death is standin' on the corner on
2nd Avenue watching the stiffs go by...

28:05.523 --> 28:08.854
in the hearse, all right,
that's the way I like it.

28:10.957 --> 28:11.924
Are you afraid?

28:13.957 --> 28:15.253
Yeah, I'm afraid.

28:16.790 --> 28:20.382
I'll instruct my lawyer immediately
to send you a check for $5,000.

28:20.490 --> 28:24.423
If you don't want the job,
I'll engage someone else.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.848
- $5,000?
- $5,000.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.356
You must want this Johnny
pretty bad.

28:39.023 --> 28:40.718
I don't like messy accounts.

28:45.223 --> 28:50.486
You know, some religions think that
the egg is the symbol of the soul.

28:50.590 --> 28:53.216
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

28:59.456 --> 29:00.923
Would you like an egg?

29:05.723 --> 29:08.212
No, thank you.
I got a thing about chickens.

30:19.056 --> 30:22.955
<i>I've got a higher plane</i>

30:28.023 --> 30:32.582
<i>I've got a higher plane</i>

30:32.690 --> 30:34.554
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

30:59.557 --> 31:01.989
<i>- A higher plane
- Oh, yeah</i>

31:02.089 --> 31:04.885
<i>I don't know why</i>

31:06.089 --> 31:08.181
<i>I've found it</i>

31:08.290 --> 31:13.053
<i>- I've got a higher plane
- Oh, I--</i>

32:47.823 --> 32:51.188
<i>Gavilan weighs 146 pounds
tonight, just a pound...</i>

32:51.290 --> 32:54.587
<i>under the welterweight limit.</i>

32:54.690 --> 32:57.088
<i>Turner weighs 144 1/2.</i>

32:57.190 --> 33:02.180
<i>It's a $270,000 gate, an all-time
record for the welterweight title.</i>

33:03.690 --> 33:06.713
It's after 11:00, Harry.
You're late.

33:06.823 --> 33:10.416
I'm sorry. Did you get it?

33:10.523 --> 33:14.956
If I lose my job,
I'll come and be your secretary.

33:15.056 --> 33:18.353
Hey, I couldn't pay you what the <i>Times</i>
pays. Besides, they're not gonna miss it.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.321
They must be digging up stuff
like this all the time.

33:21.423 --> 33:23.685
Hiya, Johnny.
Where the fuck are you?

33:24.623 --> 33:26.953
Johnny Favorite was a crooner,
like you said.

33:27.056 --> 33:28.784
I didn't realize he was so big.

33:28.889 --> 33:32.220
He used to be in a band called
the Spider Simpson orchestra.

33:32.323 --> 33:35.778
- All dead. Only Spider's here in town.
- Oh, yeah? Where is he?

33:35.889 --> 33:38.152
I wrote it all down.

33:38.256 --> 33:40.813
The dyke in Archiving's library
is getting suspicious.

33:40.923 --> 33:43.186
My boss hasn't researched
a story in years.

33:43.290 --> 33:45.280
You can get the files.

33:45.390 --> 33:49.789
Spider's in an old people's home
on 138th Street.

33:49.889 --> 33:51.788
Oh, wonderful.
I get to go to Harlem again.

33:51.889 --> 33:54.550
There was a picture of Johnny
with a guy called Toots Sweet.

33:54.656 --> 33:56.123
- A guitar player.
- And?

33:56.223 --> 33:59.781
No one's heard of him for years.
Now here's the juicy bit.

33:59.889 --> 34:03.118
He was engaged to a rich broad,
name of Margaret Krusemark.

34:03.223 --> 34:04.712
Dad Ethan owns half of Louisiana.

34:04.823 --> 34:08.154
Met Johnny at a high school prom
in New Orleans.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.813
Johnny shit on her, and she went
back home to Daddy.

34:10.922 --> 34:14.322
- Oh, yeah, there's lots under spells.
- Spells?

34:14.422 --> 34:16.650
What do you mean, spells?

34:16.755 --> 34:21.156
You mean like eye of a newt
and toe of a frog, that kind of shit?

34:21.255 --> 34:23.155
Seems she's a bit of a crackpot.

34:23.255 --> 34:26.518
Casting spells at society do's
and stuff.

34:26.621 --> 34:30.248
Didn't go down too well
with the Ivy League stiffos.

34:30.356 --> 34:34.880
Oh, yeah, she was known
as the Witch of Wellesley.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.217
The Witch of Wellesley.

34:37.322 --> 34:40.777
- Did I do good?
- Yeah, you did great.

34:40.889 --> 34:45.947
So, what do I got? I got some kind
of religious loony for a client.

34:46.056 --> 34:48.420
I gotta find Johnny Golden Tonsils.

34:48.523 --> 34:53.081
We don't know where he is.
He probably doesn't know who he is.

34:53.190 --> 34:57.385
I got a geriatric bandleader
at a home in Harlem.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.923
I got a guitar player
called Toots Sweet.

35:01.023 --> 35:04.286
- What else I got?
- A hard-on.

35:08.722 --> 35:11.780
<i>Are you okay?</i>

35:48.589 --> 35:51.318
<i>January 3, 1955.</i>

35:51.423 --> 35:53.821
<i>Client: Louis Cyphre.</i>

35:53.923 --> 35:57.516
<i>Copy: Winesap and Mackintosh,
attorneys.</i>

35:57.622 --> 36:00.488
<i>As reported,
Johnny Favorite has not been...</i>

36:00.589 --> 36:05.455
<i>in the Sarah Dodd Nursing Home
of Poughkeepsie for the last 12 years.</i>

36:05.556 --> 36:10.013
<i>He was taken away by a man
called Edward Kelly and a girl.</i>

36:10.123 --> 36:12.521
<i>The girl is unidentified.</i>

36:12.622 --> 36:16.646
<i>Kelly paid a Dr. Fowler $25,000
to falsify reports...</i>

36:16.756 --> 36:19.780
<i>stating Favorite was still
at the hospital.</i>

36:24.689 --> 36:29.748
The doctor is now deceased.

36:29.856 --> 36:33.983
Before Johnny's accident, it seemed
his career was goin' great...

36:34.089 --> 36:37.817
till he started to dump
on everyone around him.

36:37.923 --> 36:41.049
<i>I tracked down Spider Simpson,
Johnny's old bandleader.</i>

36:41.156 --> 36:44.214
<i>Spider now resides at
the Lincoln Presbyterian Hospice...</i>

36:44.323 --> 36:48.313
<i>for the Elderly, on 138th Street.</i>

36:48.423 --> 36:52.913
<i>Johnny also had a close buddy,
a guitar player called Toots Sweet.</i>

36:53.023 --> 36:54.922
<i>Toots went back to Algiers.</i>

36:55.023 --> 36:59.013
<i>That ain't Algiers in Africa.
That's Algiers in New Orleans.</i>

36:59.123 --> 37:04.079
I think maybe Margaret went
back there too, and maybe Johnny.

37:04.190 --> 37:09.351
Oh, yeah. According to Spider,
Johnny had a secret love.

37:09.455 --> 37:13.389
A black lady called
Evangeline Proudfoot.

37:13.489 --> 37:18.287
Evangeline ran some kind
of spooky store in Harlem...

37:18.390 --> 37:20.788
called Mammy Carter's.

37:27.722 --> 37:28.950
You don't need
to know that, Cyphre.

37:29.056 --> 37:34.580
I think secret loves
should stay secret.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.185
<i>And the only other person
Johnny was seeing regularly...</i>

37:39.290 --> 37:44.246
<i>was a palm reader out in Coney Island
called Madame Zora.</i>

38:05.290 --> 38:07.189
Hey, you Izzy?

38:07.290 --> 38:09.189
Yeah.

38:09.290 --> 38:12.586
- It looks like the last of the sun, huh?
- Yep.

38:12.689 --> 38:15.952
Hey, listen. The guy in the arcade over
there told me you might be able to help.

38:16.056 --> 38:18.148
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:18.256 --> 38:20.155
I'm lookin' for a Madame Zora.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.552
Yeah, sure, I know her.
A friend of the wife before the war.

38:23.656 --> 38:26.418
- It's the fortune teller, right?
- Yeah, and then some.

38:26.522 --> 38:30.512
Real creepy. I hate those
hocus-pocus bitches. Fuckin' witch.

38:30.622 --> 38:32.521
Her and the wife got along real well.

38:32.622 --> 38:34.555
The wife's a Baptist. Oh, here.

38:35.789 --> 38:39.279
Have a nose shield.
Go on. Take one.

38:39.389 --> 38:43.084
I found a whole boxful
under the boardwalk.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.123
There's not much sun
in the city right now.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.883
Yeah, but it keeps the rain off too.

38:48.023 --> 38:50.922
Hey, listen. You ever hear
of a Johnny Favorite?

38:51.023 --> 38:52.785
- The singer?
- The crooner.

38:52.889 --> 38:54.719
Used to visit Madame Zora
all the time?

38:54.823 --> 38:57.222
I heard of him, but I don't know
nothin' about him.

38:57.323 --> 39:00.619
Ask the wife. She'll know. She's always
singin' stupid tunes off the radio.

39:00.722 --> 39:03.053
She knows all that kind of shit.

39:03.156 --> 39:05.884
- She likes the water, huh?
- Nope. Hates it.

39:05.989 --> 39:09.422
She's gettin' on the heavy side.
She thinks it's good for varicose veins.

39:12.889 --> 39:14.412
All right. Thanks.

39:14.522 --> 39:17.353
Listen. What do you do around here
in the summertime?

39:17.455 --> 39:22.014
- I bite the heads off of rats.
- What do you do in the winter?

39:22.123 --> 39:24.419
Same.

39:36.355 --> 39:39.050
Excuse me!

39:39.156 --> 39:42.645
I was just talkin'
to your husband over there!

39:42.756 --> 39:45.951
I was inquiring about a Madame Zora!

39:46.056 --> 39:49.318
Yeah, I knew her before the war.
Madame Zora, you say?

39:49.422 --> 39:52.355
Yeah, she was some kind
of gypsy fortune-teller.

39:52.455 --> 39:55.752
Yeah, she used to have the booth
across the boardwalk from me.

39:55.856 --> 39:58.687
She weren't no gypsy.
She was a debutante.

39:58.789 --> 40:01.018
She was messin' with more
than readin' tea leaves.

40:01.123 --> 40:04.283
Did you ever see her with a guy
called Johnny Favorite?

40:04.389 --> 40:09.652
Yeah, he was cute. Used to visit her
all the time. She was real stuck on him.

40:09.756 --> 40:13.712
The guy with the golden tonsils, they
used to call him. I knew all his tunes.

40:13.823 --> 40:17.052
Hey, did you ever hear of a--
of a Margaret Krusemark?

40:17.156 --> 40:22.418
Don't be a gazoony, fella.
Madame Zora was Margaret Krusemark.

40:24.289 --> 40:25.756
Well, what happened to her?

40:25.856 --> 40:31.119
Packed up her stuff one day and closed
up for good. Went back home. Down south.

40:31.223 --> 40:34.621
Do you have any idea where
I could find Johnny Favorite?

40:34.722 --> 40:37.121
Nope.
Maybe the cemetery.

40:37.223 --> 40:39.621
Wanna hear one of his tunes?

40:39.722 --> 40:44.451
<i>I cried for you</i>

40:44.556 --> 40:48.956
<i>Now it's your turn to cry over--</i>

40:49.056 --> 40:51.522
Hey, thanks for the nose shield.

40:51.622 --> 40:53.350
- Okay.
- I'm gonna need it where I'm goin'.

40:53.455 --> 40:55.786
- In Brooklyn?
- Nah. Louisiana.

40:55.889 --> 40:57.719
Nice.

40:59.023 --> 41:00.512
Where'd he go?

43:55.923 --> 43:59.015
Mr. Angel.

43:59.122 --> 44:01.316
Sorry to keep you waitin'.
You're a little early.

44:01.422 --> 44:04.856
Well, I had a bad line.
I didn't know if it was 4:00 or 4:30.

44:10.622 --> 44:13.248
Wow, this is really
a wild place you got here.

44:13.355 --> 44:15.686
Yes, I've been very happy here.

44:15.789 --> 44:18.051
Hey, you know, I never
had my fortune read before.

44:18.155 --> 44:21.520
- Does this take long?
- I'll just take the details now.

44:21.622 --> 44:24.179
It usually takes me
a couple of days to do a chart.

44:28.622 --> 44:30.486
Tea?

44:32.055 --> 44:35.045
- Do you want some tea?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

44:41.155 --> 44:43.554
Darjeeling, jasmine or oolong?

44:45.022 --> 44:48.456
- Oolong.
- Not many people like oolong.

44:58.556 --> 45:00.455
You play the piano?

45:01.722 --> 45:03.120
No, not exactly.

45:04.189 --> 45:05.656
Sing?

45:06.756 --> 45:09.848
Well, I can carry a tune,
but not really.

45:14.222 --> 45:16.917
So, who's this mean-looking guy?

45:18.255 --> 45:19.722
It's my father.

45:19.823 --> 45:21.790
Oh. I'm sorry.

45:21.889 --> 45:23.947
Don't worry. He hates it too.

45:24.055 --> 45:28.318
You know, he really looks like one
of those guys in an old pirate movie.

45:28.422 --> 45:29.889
What's his name?

45:29.988 --> 45:34.388
- Ethan.
- Ethan. Ethan Krusemark.

45:34.489 --> 45:37.285
Well, I'll tell ya, you know,
I never saw any of Ethan's movies.

45:48.988 --> 45:50.455
Do you speak French, Mr. Angel?

45:52.122 --> 45:55.578
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke.

45:55.689 --> 45:58.383
Oh, that's okay.

45:58.489 --> 46:03.354
- Cream or sugar?
- No. Straight up is fine, thank you.

46:03.455 --> 46:06.217
Now. I'm gonna need
your exact date of birth.

46:06.322 --> 46:08.221
Sure.

46:08.322 --> 46:10.380
Okay, I was...

46:10.489 --> 46:12.955
born February 14.

46:16.955 --> 46:20.116
1918. That's Valentine's Day.

46:21.922 --> 46:23.946
How curious.

46:24.055 --> 46:27.079
I used to know a boy who was born
on that exact same date.

46:27.189 --> 46:29.588
Oh? Really?

46:29.689 --> 46:32.951
Well, you know how it is.
All the soldiers home on leave and all.

46:33.055 --> 46:37.489
Hey, maybe we could pull your friend's
chart and save ourselves some time.

46:37.589 --> 46:39.953
I don't think so, Mr. Angel.

46:40.055 --> 46:44.113
Every person's very different.
I don't think you'd like his chart.

46:46.389 --> 46:50.186
- Place of birth?
- Brooklyn, New York.

46:50.289 --> 46:52.620
Why, was he a jerk
or something, your friend?

46:53.922 --> 46:55.287
Yeah, you could say that.

46:57.756 --> 47:02.451
So, I guess you just didn't get along.
You and Johnny.

47:08.255 --> 47:10.620
You and Johnny Favorite?

47:18.189 --> 47:19.917
Who are you?

47:20.022 --> 47:22.182
I was an old army buddy.

47:22.289 --> 47:25.723
I thought that you two
were kind of a--You know.

47:26.789 --> 47:28.948
All right. Look.
I ain't no army buddy.

47:29.055 --> 47:31.284
I'm just a guy who was
paid to snoop around.

47:31.389 --> 47:35.652
But to tell you the truth, I wasn't born
on Valentine's Day.

47:35.756 --> 47:39.120
It's Johnny's future
that I'm interested in.

47:39.222 --> 47:42.712
Johnny has no future. He's dead.

47:42.822 --> 47:46.017
He died 12 years ago, and Mr. Angel,
I'd like you to leave.

47:46.122 --> 47:51.112
Look, I know you're probably thinking
who's this creep lookin' to snitch around.

47:51.222 --> 47:53.814
I don't want to sound nosy
or nothin', but--

47:53.922 --> 47:58.117
He's dead, Mr. Angel.
And if he isn't, he is to me.

47:58.222 --> 48:02.656
Wow. He must've hurt you
pretty bad.

48:02.756 --> 48:05.279
We all have our scars, Mr. Angel.

48:05.389 --> 48:07.652
Well, look. You know, I don't know
too much about this guy...

48:07.756 --> 48:10.621
but he must've been really stupid
if he let you go.

48:10.722 --> 48:15.280
Lies and cruelty come very easy
to some people. Good-bye, Mr. Angel.

48:15.389 --> 48:19.152
It's a pity. You know, I really would've
liked to have gotten my palm read.

48:19.255 --> 48:22.051
Could've held your hand
a little while longer.

48:24.522 --> 48:27.421
I don't think you'd like what I see.

48:29.689 --> 48:33.849
That's a very pretty necklace
you got there.

49:04.222 --> 49:06.086
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:07.455 --> 49:10.785
You got any
Hygeia the Conqueror root?

49:10.888 --> 49:14.413
- Powdered or hanging?
- I don't know. I'm not really sure.

49:14.522 --> 49:17.955
- Caught in the rain, huh?
- Yeah.

49:20.055 --> 49:22.454
Two roots. $1.20.

49:22.556 --> 49:26.716
Listen, I have a question
I wanna ask you.

49:26.822 --> 49:29.914
I have an acquaintance
back in Harlem...

49:30.022 --> 49:33.012
who used to deal
in Hygeia the Conqueror root.

49:33.122 --> 49:35.884
And her name was Evangeline.
Did you ever hear of her?

49:35.988 --> 49:39.114
Practically everyone around here
is called Evangeline, mister.

49:39.222 --> 49:42.212
After the poem.
You know the poem?

49:42.322 --> 49:45.289
Yeah, I know the poem.
This--

49:45.389 --> 49:49.788
This acquaintance of mine had a store in
Harlem. It was the same name. Carter.

49:49.888 --> 49:54.878
Everybody uses the name, mister. Like
Howard Johnson? This is the real place.

49:54.988 --> 50:00.513
Her name was Proudfoot,
Evangeline Proudfoot.

50:00.622 --> 50:04.248
Yeah, I knew her.

50:04.355 --> 50:06.947
She used to come back here all the time
when she was livin' in New York.

50:07.055 --> 50:09.284
Well, do you know
where she is now?

50:09.389 --> 50:13.652
She got sick. Died.
Went back to Holy Shelter Swamp.

50:13.755 --> 50:17.120
They buried her in Almondville.
She was waitin' on some fella.

50:17.222 --> 50:20.280
- Just like in the poem, huh?
- Just like the poem.

50:20.389 --> 50:22.288
$1.20.

50:24.055 --> 50:26.851
Well, who was the guy?

50:26.955 --> 50:28.683
She never told.

50:31.721 --> 50:33.621
Okay, thanks.

50:41.322 --> 50:44.777
- A week, you say?
- Yeah, at most.

51:40.888 --> 51:45.151
What you crying for?
What? What?

51:45.255 --> 51:47.347
What you crying for?

51:47.455 --> 51:51.218
Let's go see Grandma.
Who's over there?

51:51.322 --> 51:54.221
It's Grandma. Grandma.

52:08.422 --> 52:10.355
Let's go.

52:11.455 --> 52:14.286
Give me your hand.

52:39.489 --> 52:40.546
Soap.

52:58.289 --> 52:58.880
Excuse me?

53:01.155 --> 53:04.588
- Miss Proudfoot?
- Yeah.

53:07.389 --> 53:09.685
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got these from some guy...

53:09.788 --> 53:12.778
and it's funny
how some babies react to 'em.

53:15.322 --> 53:18.289
- I'm sorry.
- Stop crying.

53:21.155 --> 53:24.713
Listen, I was hoping maybe
I could talk with your mama.

53:24.822 --> 53:28.687
Yeah? You're a little late for that.
Did you know her?

53:28.788 --> 53:31.085
No, I've never met her,
but I was hoping...

53:31.189 --> 53:33.849
maybe she could answer
a few questions for me.

53:33.955 --> 53:38.252
- What are you? Some kind of cop?
- No. My name's Harry Angel.

53:38.355 --> 53:42.515
How are you?
I'm a private detective.

53:42.621 --> 53:44.781
- So what's--
- Epiphany.

53:44.888 --> 53:48.287
- Epiphany?
- Yeah.

53:48.389 --> 53:51.379
Your mama left you
with a very beautiful name, Epiphany.

53:51.488 --> 53:54.614
- Not much else.
- Oh.

53:54.721 --> 53:57.950
Well, actually, to be quite frank,
I'm looking for a friend...

53:58.055 --> 54:00.817
of your mama's,
a guy called Johnny Favorite.

54:00.922 --> 54:03.116
Yeah? I met all of mama's friends.

54:03.222 --> 54:04.779
I never met anyone called Favorite.

54:05.688 --> 54:11.451
Jesus. Oh, shit!
I got a thing about chickens.

54:14.955 --> 54:16.979
Yeah. This guy Favorite.

54:17.088 --> 54:20.714
He was friends with your mama,
back in New York City, before the war.

54:20.822 --> 54:23.187
Yeah? She never told me.

54:23.289 --> 54:25.755
My mama had a lot of guys.
She liked men.

54:25.855 --> 54:28.549
How 'bout a guy
named Toots Sweet?

54:28.655 --> 54:31.554
He was a friend of Favorite's.
Did you ever meet him?

54:31.655 --> 54:33.884
He was supposed to be
a pretty good guitar player.

54:33.988 --> 54:36.148
I was gonna go try
to catch his act tonight.

54:39.389 --> 54:43.220
Well, listen, I'm gonna be stayin' here
in town, in a hotel.

54:43.322 --> 54:47.550
And I figured if maybe, if you could
remember anything that might help me...

54:47.655 --> 54:50.747
maybe you could give me a call.

54:57.655 --> 55:01.952
You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany.
Your name suits you.

55:06.421 --> 55:07.854
Chickens.

55:14.488 --> 55:17.183
Hey, what are you after him for?
Johnny Favorite?

55:17.289 --> 55:21.847
I'm not really after him. I'm just
being paid to find out where he is.

55:21.955 --> 55:23.854
He could be six feet under.

55:25.055 --> 55:27.715
Then I'll have to buy a shovel.

55:40.122 --> 55:40.145
<i>She had two cups of coffee</i>

55:46.488 --> 55:51.786
<i>And I had one small cup of tea</i>

55:53.655 --> 55:57.145
<i>You just walked out of my life</i>

55:58.688 --> 56:01.951
<i>Left them low-down
dirty blues with me</i>

56:07.822 --> 56:10.119
<i>It was on</i>

56:10.222 --> 56:14.450
<i>Oh, Lord, it was on</i>

56:14.555 --> 56:16.545
<i>On a rainy day</i>

56:16.655 --> 56:19.213
<i>One time for Toots</i>

56:21.055 --> 56:24.284
<i>It was on</i>

56:24.388 --> 56:27.947
<i>- Oh, Lord it was on</i>
- How's it hangin', sugar?

56:28.055 --> 56:29.954
<i>On a rainy day</i>

56:35.288 --> 56:36.414
Go ahead.

56:58.288 --> 57:01.619
Hey, that was some beautiful tune
you were singing in there, Mr. Sweet.

57:01.721 --> 57:04.620
- Toots, son. Thank you.
- Yeah, listen. Can I buy you a drink?

57:04.721 --> 57:06.881
No, I get mine on the house.
Two Sisters cocktails.

57:06.988 --> 57:10.114
Don't know what's in 'em, but I get
a bigger kick than I do six stingers.

57:10.222 --> 57:13.780
Listen. You know that I heard
you play years ago in New York?

57:13.888 --> 57:16.821
Yeah, it was before the war
at the old Dicky Wells bar.

57:16.922 --> 57:18.821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:18.922 --> 57:23.912
You was hammin' it up pretty good
with some cat called Johnny Favorite.

57:24.022 --> 57:26.420
Yeah, I vaguely remember
playin' with that guy once.

57:26.521 --> 57:28.920
Yeah, you and him was buddies,
weren't you?

57:29.022 --> 57:31.511
No. He made a record of one of my songs,
but that don't make us buddies.

57:31.621 --> 57:33.952
Say, are you a dick or book writer?

57:34.055 --> 57:36.521
I'm neither.
What I am, I'm a journalist.

57:36.621 --> 57:38.781
You see, what I'm doing is,
I'm doing this piece.

57:38.888 --> 57:42.514
The piece is on Johnny and
the old Spider Simpson Orchestra.

57:42.621 --> 57:46.418
I remember Spider. He used to play them
drums like two jack rabbits fuckin'.

57:46.521 --> 57:48.113
Got to go, son.
Ain't got much time.

57:48.221 --> 57:52.121
A piss and a spit and back to work.
Try one of them Two Sisters cocktails...

57:52.221 --> 57:54.654
and then you can make the whole
thing up, any way you want to.

57:54.755 --> 57:58.052
That's what you newspaper people
do anyway, don't you?

58:05.221 --> 58:10.780
<i>He starts his lovin'
when you get through</i>

58:19.055 --> 58:20.147
Can't even take a piss.

58:20.254 --> 58:22.847
Hey, look, pal. I just wanted
to have a little talk...

58:22.955 --> 58:25.183
with you about Johnny Favorite
and Evangeline Proud--

58:25.288 --> 58:27.517
I'm too big to go hidin' under beds.
I don't know nothin'.

58:27.621 --> 58:31.452
Two Sisters cocktails are the only thing
I'm interested in nowadays. Fuck!

58:46.155 --> 58:48.621
- What's going on, Toots?
- Nothing.

58:48.721 --> 58:52.176
Mind your own business.
I wanna piss.

58:52.288 --> 58:55.449
If you don't get the hell out of here,
I may clean you out on the sidewalk.

58:55.555 --> 58:57.579
You gonna wish your little
white ass never was born.

58:57.688 --> 58:59.848
Please.
I got a thing about chickens.

58:59.955 --> 59:05.048
<i>So take a tip, honey
and just leave my door</i>

59:05.154 --> 59:09.850
<i>Because your key don't fit
in my lock no more</i>

59:09.955 --> 59:12.319
<i>You got the right key</i>

59:12.421 --> 59:18.582
<i>You're knockin' on the wrong door</i>

59:44.488 --> 59:46.455
<i>Zu Zu Mamou</i>

59:46.555 --> 59:49.488
<i>With your pigtail on</i>

59:49.588 --> 59:54.578
<i>Say somebody crossed you
Now your mind is gone</i>

59:54.688 --> 59:57.416
<i>If it hurts you too bad</i>

59:57.521 --> 59:59.511
<i>Call for help</i>

59:59.621 --> 01:00:04.350
<i>Don't be ashamed to call a doctor when
there ain't nobody left to tell ya now</i>

01:00:12.087 --> 01:00:14.577
<i>Zu Zu Mamou</i>

01:02:59.822 --> 01:03:01.812
All right, now. Hey.

01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:04.821
This is the end of bullshit time,
pal, okay?

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:06.889
I got a good look
at you and Epiphany...

01:03:06.987 --> 01:03:10.682
doin' your hot-shoe number
with the chicken.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.550
And listen.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:15.850
I ain't up on all this voodoo shit.
I'm from Brooklyn.

01:03:15.954 --> 01:03:18.547
We ain't all Baptists
down here, sonny.

01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:20.645
What's the story
with this Proudfoot girl?

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:25.154
She's a mambo priestess, like her mom.
Has been since she was 13.

01:03:25.254 --> 01:03:28.346
When's the last time you saw Johnny
Favorite at one of those chicken stuffings?

01:03:28.454 --> 01:03:30.683
He used to run around
with Mom Mambo, didn't he?

01:03:30.788 --> 01:03:34.084
I told you, I ain't seen him
since before the war.

01:03:34.188 --> 01:03:36.314
What about the chicken foot
in the john, huh?

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:40.616
- Means I got a big mouth.
- Not big enough, Toots.

01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:44.245
What's this fuckin' star you wear
in your mouth? I'll tell you what.

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:48.879
I'm gonna give you my hotel number,
and you give me a call...

01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:51.352
in case you hear anything.

01:03:52.822 --> 01:03:55.379
You never know,
the next time you get...

01:03:55.488 --> 01:03:59.012
a special delivery chicken foot,
you may need a little help.

01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:01.986
I'll tell you, as far as I'm concerned...

01:04:02.087 --> 01:04:05.020
any dead chicken's
a good chicken to me.

01:05:52.288 --> 01:05:54.687
Hey, only cops and bad news
don't knock.

01:05:54.787 --> 01:05:56.811
Only private dicks sleep so late.

01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:58.911
That's quite a dream you were having.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:02.614
I was on my way to Mandalay again.

01:06:05.421 --> 01:06:08.183
Shit. That's some leak you got up there.

01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.919
Here. This your name?

01:06:22.388 --> 01:06:25.412
- Yeah.
- That your hotel?

01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:28.715
- You're standin' in it, ain't you?
- Your handwritin'?

01:06:30.021 --> 01:06:32.545
I think so.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:33.985
Then perhaps you'd like
to tell us why...

01:06:34.087 --> 01:06:37.815
we found that in the hand
of a dead guitar player?

01:06:42.288 --> 01:06:46.119
- Toots Sweet is dead?
- Yeah. Toots Sweet.

01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:48.983
Only this one weren't so quick.
This one took time.

01:06:50.154 --> 01:06:51.621
How did he die?

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.586
Technically, asphyxiation
by his own genitalia.

01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:58.354
But not so technically.

01:06:58.454 --> 01:07:02.012
Somebody cut his dick off, stuffed it
in his mouth and choked him to death.

01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:05.111
Took to redecoratin' his apartment
with the poor jerk's blood.

01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:07.813
So, when'd you see him, Angel?

01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.582
- I interviewed him yesterday around 1:00.
- In connection with what?

01:07:11.687 --> 01:07:14.177
Missing person.

01:07:14.288 --> 01:07:16.880
Who?

01:07:16.987 --> 01:07:21.444
Some cat took a walk 12 years ago. I saw
Toots in an old photograph with him.

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:22.987
What's the name of this party
you're lookin' for?

01:07:23.087 --> 01:07:25.077
Sorry, friend. Can't say.
That's right of privacy.

01:07:25.188 --> 01:07:27.882
- I'm workin' for a New York lawyer.
- Name?

01:07:27.987 --> 01:07:30.352
Ah, come on, man.

01:07:30.454 --> 01:07:33.887
Winesap. You want his number,
you want his address?

01:07:33.987 --> 01:07:36.818
Ask Tess Trueheart over there.
It's in the book he's flickin' through.

01:07:36.921 --> 01:07:39.184
It's under "W," genius.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.551
You know Ted Williams,
the baseball player?

01:07:41.654 --> 01:07:43.678
Yeah.

01:07:45.954 --> 01:07:47.114
Herman Winesap.

01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:51.681
All right, is that it, guys?

01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:55.947
That's it.

01:07:56.054 --> 01:07:58.953
You and your "right to privacy"
can go eat lunch.

01:07:59.054 --> 01:08:00.453
But don't stroll too far, Angel.

01:08:00.555 --> 01:08:03.351
Not till we talk
to this lawyer of yours.

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.815
You ever watch
the <i>Mickey Mouse Club?</i>

01:08:15.854 --> 01:08:18.946
'Cause you know what today--
today is?

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:24.180
Today is Wednesday.
It's "anything can happen" day.

01:09:53.787 --> 01:09:56.515
Hey, man, you want a tune?

01:09:58.021 --> 01:10:00.147
Yeah, I got a tune for you.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.378
Hiya, boys.

01:14:31.253 --> 01:14:32.743
Ah, same to you.

01:14:32.854 --> 01:14:36.378
Hey, I'm gettin' kind of hungry.
You wanna sell some of those things?

01:14:36.487 --> 01:14:38.148
Hey, Pop.

01:14:42.987 --> 01:14:45.954
- Ten cents a sack.
- Sure, man, give me a sack.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.211
Ah, shit! Get--

01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:12.720
You listen good, mister.

01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:15.879
Margaret Krusemark's old man
wants you on that train home.

01:15:15.987 --> 01:15:18.419
Get that fuckin' thing
away from me!

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.113
If you don't, my dog here's gonna
bite your fuckin' face clean off.

01:15:48.153 --> 01:15:50.518
What happened to you?

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.644
A dog bit me.

01:15:52.754 --> 01:15:54.846
Yeah, so?
What do you want?

01:15:56.287 --> 01:15:58.720
Well, right now, I--
I need a laundry.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.049
- Listen, "Epithany."
- Epiphany.

01:16:03.153 --> 01:16:06.609
Epiphany. I got something
on my mind I wanna ask you.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.414
Yeah. The other night
I saw you and Toots Sweet...

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.180
boogyin' with the cock-a-doodle-doo
out in the woods.

01:16:13.287 --> 01:16:15.481
Looked like you all
were havin' some party.

01:16:15.587 --> 01:16:18.748
Yeah, so what's your problem?
It's a free country.

01:16:18.854 --> 01:16:20.184
Not for chickens it ain't.

01:16:20.287 --> 01:16:22.754
Oh, yeah, you got a thing
about chickens. I remember.

01:16:22.854 --> 01:16:26.787
Listen, Epiphany,
Toots is--Toots is dead.

01:16:26.887 --> 01:16:28.786
I know. I heard.

01:16:28.887 --> 01:16:31.047
- And you set him up.
- No, I didn't.

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:34.712
You were the only one
that knew I was seein' Toots.

01:16:34.821 --> 01:16:38.845
Yeah. You're the one that sent the
gift-wrapped chicken for two, aren't you?

01:16:38.954 --> 01:16:41.318
Yeah, well, Toots had a big mouth.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:45.047
I guess he did, judgin' by
what the cops found in it.

01:16:45.153 --> 01:16:46.586
Quite a cute religion you got.

01:16:46.687 --> 01:16:49.848
Well, nailing a man to a cross
ain't so cute, either.

01:16:49.954 --> 01:16:51.944
Yeah, I know. You got to kill
a chicken to make the soup.

01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:57.988
We don't go around murdering people,
all right? What about Johnny Favorite?

01:16:58.086 --> 01:17:01.247
Oh. So now you remember
him after all, huh?

01:17:01.353 --> 01:17:03.650
Yeah, he was my father.

01:17:06.153 --> 01:17:08.245
Mince?

01:17:09.353 --> 01:17:11.252
Mince, I'm gonna pick
the baby up later, okay?

01:17:11.353 --> 01:17:12.320
He's gonna be all right.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:17.479
Hey, look, if you got anything you're
holding out, now's a good time to tell.

01:17:17.587 --> 01:17:19.816
Nothing to tell.

01:17:19.921 --> 01:17:23.479
Johnny never came back
from the war.

01:17:23.587 --> 01:17:27.145
Mama waited. Mama died.
It's sad and simple.

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.485
Epiphany, there's too many
dead bodies floatin' around...

01:17:31.587 --> 01:17:33.577
even for Louisiana.

01:17:33.687 --> 01:17:36.848
I'd tell your old man
to look out for you.

01:17:36.954 --> 01:17:40.114
- You do have a husband.
- No. No husband.

01:17:41.353 --> 01:17:44.946
Jesus, you got
beautiful eyes, Epiphany.

01:17:45.053 --> 01:17:47.816
You really do.
They're truly beautiful.

01:17:47.921 --> 01:17:52.354
They're the kind of eyes you can tell
just what's goin' on inside.

01:17:52.453 --> 01:17:55.181
- Right now you're scared.
- I manage.

01:17:57.587 --> 01:18:02.543
- Hey, well, listen--
- Yeah. I'll call you if I hear anything.

01:18:02.654 --> 01:18:04.848
Hey.

01:18:04.954 --> 01:18:05.977
Call me if you don't.

01:18:08.353 --> 01:18:10.252
All right?

01:18:32.086 --> 01:18:34.519
I have a message for you.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.678
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:19:41.153 --> 01:19:42.711
I'm so glad you could come.

01:19:42.821 --> 01:19:45.515
Yeah. I didn't know
you were comin' to town.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.280
I have a speaking engagement
in Baton Rouge...

01:19:47.387 --> 01:19:50.479
and I thought it would be opportune
to catch up on your progress.

01:19:50.587 --> 01:19:52.884
I'm tellin' ya--

01:19:52.986 --> 01:19:55.249
Progress ain't too good.

01:19:55.353 --> 01:19:58.013
I found out a lot of stuff.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.815
But so far, no Johnny Favorite.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.547
How unfortunate.

01:20:03.654 --> 01:20:05.348
All I got is a bellyful
of hocus-pocus...

01:20:05.453 --> 01:20:08.477
and three stiffs.

01:20:08.587 --> 01:20:10.554
- Stiffs?
- Yeah.

01:20:10.654 --> 01:20:14.178
Dead bodies, Mr. Cyphre.
Murders.

01:20:14.287 --> 01:20:16.413
- Murders.
- Yeah.

01:20:18.554 --> 01:20:23.487
I got Fowler--Johnny's doctor
bumped himself off.

01:20:23.587 --> 01:20:26.951
I got this old voodoo guy,
Toots Sweet.

01:20:27.053 --> 01:20:31.578
He got choked to death with a part
of the body meant for pissing with.

01:20:31.687 --> 01:20:33.586
This is a church, Mr. Angel.

01:20:35.253 --> 01:20:37.186
Well, I'll tell you something.
I know it's a church...

01:20:37.287 --> 01:20:39.481
but there's a lot of religion
going around with this thing.

01:20:39.587 --> 01:20:43.986
It's very weird, and
I don't understand it. It's ugly.

01:20:44.086 --> 01:20:45.950
They say there's just
enough religion in the world...

01:20:46.053 --> 01:20:48.816
to make men hate one another,
but not enough to make them love.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.820
Oh, is that what they say?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.717
Well, I'll tell you something,
Mr. Cyphre, there...

01:20:53.821 --> 01:20:56.378
wasn't too much love around
for Johnny Favorite.

01:20:56.487 --> 01:21:00.682
All right, that guy was bad luck
and it's starting to rub off on me.

01:21:00.787 --> 01:21:03.379
I'm a murder suspect
already in two cases.

01:21:03.487 --> 01:21:07.477
The police found my name
and my address in Toots Sweet's hand.

01:21:07.587 --> 01:21:10.315
I know.
Winesap told me.

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.216
You must be careful, Mr. Angel.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.685
And a third? You said
there were three murders.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:20.550
I checked out Johnny's little society
girlfriend-- Margaret Krusemark.

01:21:20.654 --> 01:21:23.984
- Do you know her?
- Vaguely.

01:21:24.086 --> 01:21:28.747
Vaguely? Let me tell you, I'm a little
fed up with fuckin' "vaguely."

01:21:28.853 --> 01:21:32.252
"Vaguely" is puttin' a noose around
my neck and I'm startin' to choke.

01:21:32.353 --> 01:21:35.411
So, Mr. Cyphre,
did you know her or not?

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.009
I knew about her,
but I never actually knew her.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.814
All right. Well,
I'll tell you what.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.684
She was doin' my chart. I gave her
Johnny's birth date-- February 14--

01:21:47.187 --> 01:21:51.746
Except someone got to her and took
out their own Valentine's card.

01:21:51.853 --> 01:21:55.548
They split her open
and they cut out her heart.

01:21:56.754 --> 01:22:01.153
I guess she couldn't predict
the future for herself.

01:22:01.253 --> 01:22:03.913
The future isn't
what it used to be, Mr. Angel.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.419
- And your conclusions?
- I haven't any.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:10.351
All I know is Johnny's runnin' around
bumpin' off everyone he used to know.

01:22:10.453 --> 01:22:13.977
And more and more it's me
who's on the line for it.

01:22:14.086 --> 01:22:17.485
I'm bein' set up, and it's scarin'
the shit out of me, all right?

01:22:17.587 --> 01:22:21.520
So why don't you just tell me and level
with me what the fuck is goin' on here?

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.076
Just Johnny Favorite and the debt
that's owed to me, Mr. Angel.

01:22:27.187 --> 01:22:30.586
I have old-fashioned ideas
about honor.

01:22:30.687 --> 01:22:33.415
You know, an eye for an eye,
things like that.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.880
Who the fuck are you, Cyphre?

01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:39.544
Watch your language.

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:43.178
Hey, I don't give a fuck
if this is a church, okay?

01:22:43.287 --> 01:22:45.652
Churches give me the creeps.
I don't like churches.

01:22:45.753 --> 01:22:48.948
- Are you an atheist?
- Yes, I am.

01:22:49.053 --> 01:22:51.418
I'm from Brooklyn.

01:22:53.086 --> 01:22:54.610
I'll be in town for a day or two.

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:56.311
Let me know what else you find,
and if you need money--

01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.080
No, no, the money's fine.

01:22:59.187 --> 01:23:02.382
But if I ain't careful, that
5,000 bucks you gave me...

01:23:02.487 --> 01:23:05.477
could just buy me a seat
on the electric chair.

01:23:42.587 --> 01:23:44.486
Hi.

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:47.383
Frightened eyes never lie.

01:23:47.487 --> 01:23:50.181
Come on.
Come on inside.

01:23:57.719 --> 01:23:59.584
- Where's your child?
- He's with Mincy.

01:23:59.686 --> 01:24:01.210
She's bringing him over later.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.014
She's got 14 of her own,
so he'll be okay there.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.179
Look, Epiphany, you're very welcome
to stay here or I'll get you a room.

01:24:10.287 --> 01:24:12.277
No, I'm okay.

01:24:12.387 --> 01:24:15.377
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
have a drink. You want a drink?

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:20.185
You're gonna have one anyway.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.077
- I've been thinkin', Epiphany.
- Yeah?

01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:30.916
I was wondering what the hell your mama
ever saw in a guy like Johnny Favorite?

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.351
I don't know. Whatever he had,
he sure stole her heart away.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.117
To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.210
Well, she sure missed him.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.912
I mean, I'll tell ya.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:47.748
What does a lady see in a guy that runs
around choppin' up pigeons, you know?

01:24:47.853 --> 01:24:49.480
You know what they say.

01:24:49.587 --> 01:24:53.020
It's always the badass that makes
a girl's heart beat faster.

01:24:55.853 --> 01:24:58.218
Did she ever say
anything about him?

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.480
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

01:25:00.586 --> 01:25:03.281
- Just two things.
- Yeah, like what?

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.083
She once said that Johnny Favorite
was as close to true evil...

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.552
as she ever wanted to come.

01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:15.212
- What else did she say?
- He was a terrific lover.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.048
How old are you, Epiphany?

01:25:22.153 --> 01:25:24.881
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

01:25:26.453 --> 01:25:28.783
That's kind of young
to have a kid, isn't it?

01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:31.547
It's old enough.

01:25:33.387 --> 01:25:35.819
- So, where'd the father go?
- I never knew him.

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:40.880
I'm sorry. To tell you the truth.

01:25:40.986 --> 01:25:44.442
I don't know why
I took this room.

01:25:48.153 --> 01:25:50.211
It was at Bamboucher.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.718
When the spirits possess you,
it's called <i>chevalier.</i>

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.276
Oh, yes, I'm familiar
with that--Chevrolet.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:26:00.547
<i>- Chevalier.</i>
- That's what I said: Chevrolet.

01:26:00.653 --> 01:26:02.552
Mounted by the gods.

01:26:02.653 --> 01:26:05.814
- Oh, so the gods got you pregnant?
- Yeah.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.819
I understand that. Sorry.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.353
I'm not. It was
the best fuck I ever had.

01:26:32.519 --> 01:26:34.419
Want to dance?

01:26:34.519 --> 01:26:36.486
In here?

01:26:36.586 --> 01:26:38.883
Yeah, here.

01:26:43.519 --> 01:26:47.509
I got bit by a dog this mornin'.
I can't move around.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:51.348
Well, you won't feel a thing.

01:26:52.486 --> 01:26:55.352
- Well, I'll dance with you.
- Yeah?

01:26:55.453 --> 01:26:57.443
- Yeah. But you gotta promise.
- What's that?

01:26:57.553 --> 01:26:59.453
No chickens.

01:26:59.553 --> 01:27:02.679
- Okay.
- Come on. Jump on.

01:27:10.086 --> 01:27:13.484
<i>And I really</i>

01:27:13.586 --> 01:27:15.610
<i>Had my fun</i>

01:27:16.719 --> 01:27:19.709
<i>With all the boyfriends</i>

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:23.151
<i>The good time men friends</i>

01:27:23.253 --> 01:27:27.345
<i>I've still had to walk this road</i>

01:27:27.452 --> 01:27:30.113
<i>All by myself</i>

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:33.415
<i>I was that playgirl</i>

01:27:33.519 --> 01:27:37.112
<i>A careless gay girl</i>

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.210
<i>But I put</i>

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.445
<i>Them all on the shelf</i>

01:27:43.553 --> 01:27:47.385
<i>I found my true love</i>

01:27:47.486 --> 01:27:51.079
<i>With you forever</i>

01:27:51.187 --> 01:27:54.245
<i>And my life</i>

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:57.581
<i>Has just begun</i>

01:27:57.686 --> 01:28:00.313
<i>'Cause now you've set</i>

01:28:00.419 --> 01:28:02.250
<i>My soul</i>

01:28:02.353 --> 01:28:05.149
<i>On fire</i>

01:28:05.253 --> 01:28:08.447
<i>And I really</i>

01:28:08.553 --> 01:28:11.645
<i>Had my fun</i>

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:15.243
<i>Good-bye to playboys</i>

01:28:15.353 --> 01:28:18.786
<i>Those hey-hey-hey boys</i>

01:28:18.886 --> 01:28:23.252
<i>Good-bye to everyone</i>

01:28:23.353 --> 01:28:25.751
<i>But you, my love</i>

01:28:25.853 --> 01:28:28.343
<i>Well, no more heartaches</i>

01:28:30.253 --> 01:28:33.118
<i>No more heartbreaks</i>

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.153
<i>I'll swear by all</i>

01:28:36.253 --> 01:28:39.243
<i>The stars above</i>

01:28:39.353 --> 01:28:42.478
<i>Well, all my soul</i>

01:28:42.586 --> 01:28:45.815
<i>My love, my heart</i>

01:28:47.253 --> 01:28:51.016
<i>I miss you, darling</i>

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.985
<i>But I'm coming up</i>

01:28:54.086 --> 01:28:57.110
<i>'Cause now you've set</i>

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.812
<i>My soul</i>

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.149
<i>On fire</i>

01:30:31.586 --> 01:30:33.917
<i>All right, I'm comin'.</i>

01:30:36.452 --> 01:30:38.919
I should've recognized the knock.

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.851
Well, at least you got reason
for sleepin' late this time.

01:30:41.953 --> 01:30:44.249
Down here, Angel, we don't
mix with the jigaboos.

01:30:44.352 --> 01:30:46.478
The colored folks
keep to themselves.

01:30:46.586 --> 01:30:48.746
Well, hey, I ain't from down here.

01:30:48.853 --> 01:30:51.410
- You cut yourself?
- A dog bit me.

01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:55.976
Somebody named Margaret Krusemark
figure in this missing persons case?

01:30:57.553 --> 01:30:59.816
- No. Why?
- She's dead.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.648
That nigger guitar player of yours,
he don't matter a shit.

01:31:03.753 --> 01:31:06.652
He was into voodoo.
They 86'd one or two a week.

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:11.311
This Krusemark dame, she comes from
a Louisiana money family--white money.

01:31:11.419 --> 01:31:14.909
So two people get bumped off in
the same week. What's the connection?

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.384
- Similar circumstances.
- Like what?

01:31:17.486 --> 01:31:19.749
Did she get her dick cut off too?

01:31:19.853 --> 01:31:23.752
No. Some fucker cut her heart out,
neat as a butcher on Decatur Street.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:27.184
Look, mine's a missing persons. It's not
a murder, okay? Why you telling me this?

01:31:27.286 --> 01:31:29.844
I want to know the name
of the party you're lookin' for.

01:31:29.953 --> 01:31:32.249
I already told you.
Call New York. Talk to the lawyer.

01:31:32.352 --> 01:31:37.013
I did. That fancy mouthpiece, he gave me
the same big-city shit as you.

01:31:38.053 --> 01:31:40.485
What do you want me to say?
Hey, you and Effie Klinker over there...

01:31:40.586 --> 01:31:43.314
why don't you just fuck off
and leave me alone?

01:31:43.419 --> 01:31:46.784
This ain't jigaboo town, ass wipe!
You play jump rope with Louisiana law...

01:31:46.886 --> 01:31:50.842
and I'm gonna stuff your big-city smarts
right up your New York ass!

01:31:50.953 --> 01:31:56.114
This Krusemark broad, she was into
stargazing, black magic, all kinds of shit.

01:31:56.219 --> 01:32:01.414
There ain't nothin' worse for a cop than
people who get killed for nutso reasons.

01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:06.883
Sorry if I made a mess. Maybe you
can get your nigger to clean it up.

01:32:15.519 --> 01:32:17.918
<i>Girl of my dreams</i>

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:20.782
<i>I love you</i>

01:32:20.886 --> 01:32:24.375
<i>Honest I do</i>

01:32:25.953 --> 01:32:30.215
<i>You are so sweet</i>

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:38.885
<i>If I could just hold your charms</i>

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:42.919
<i>Again in my arms</i>

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.452
<i>Life--</i>

01:32:45.553 --> 01:32:47.952
What's that tune you're singin'?

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.384
You don't know it?
It's one by Johnny Favorite.

01:32:51.486 --> 01:32:54.544
My mom used to sing it
to me all the time.

01:32:56.352 --> 01:33:00.444
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.316
<i>If I could just</i>

01:33:06.419 --> 01:33:09.284
<i>Hold your charms</i>

01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:13.880
<i>Again in my arms</i>

01:33:15.053 --> 01:33:18.713
<i>Life would be complete</i>

01:34:56.753 --> 01:34:58.515
Shit!

01:35:44.252 --> 01:35:46.151
Thanks.

01:36:02.186 --> 01:36:04.278
What do you want, Mr. Angel?

01:36:04.386 --> 01:36:06.751
I guess you already knew that.

01:36:06.853 --> 01:36:08.479
Why should I?

01:36:08.586 --> 01:36:10.916
A couple of your morons
with a matching poodle...

01:36:11.019 --> 01:36:13.714
have been chasing
my balls around for days.

01:36:15.152 --> 01:36:17.517
I'm looking for Johnny Favorite.

01:36:17.619 --> 01:36:21.575
As far as I know, that dance band
scumbag is dead.

01:36:21.686 --> 01:36:25.881
That dance band scumbag may be
the one that killed your daughter.

01:36:25.985 --> 01:36:28.918
Who's employing you?

01:36:29.019 --> 01:36:30.611
I can't say.

01:36:30.719 --> 01:36:32.686
I'll pay.

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.753
So do they.

01:36:34.853 --> 01:36:37.820
Twelve years ago you and your daughter
snatched Favorite...

01:36:37.919 --> 01:36:40.886
out of some nuthatch
up in Poughkeepsie.

01:36:40.985 --> 01:36:45.975
You paid a junkie doctor 25 grand to
pretend Johnny was still a turniphead.

01:36:46.085 --> 01:36:49.984
You did a pretty good job
until a week ago.

01:36:50.085 --> 01:36:52.881
You used the name Edward Kelly.

01:36:55.753 --> 01:37:00.243
Let's walk over here. It's a little
private, and you can sample our gumbo.

01:37:00.352 --> 01:37:02.751
That's all right.
I got a nasty stomach.

01:37:02.853 --> 01:37:05.479
Besides, Cajun cooking kills me.

01:37:10.352 --> 01:37:13.944
It's a pity about your stomach.
You'd have enjoyed our gumbo.

01:37:32.852 --> 01:37:36.979
I was Edward Kelly. It was me
who paid Fowler the 25 G's.

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:40.812
- Did Favorite know you?
- No.

01:37:40.919 --> 01:37:42.386
He acted like a sleepwalker.

01:37:42.486 --> 01:37:44.850
He just stared out the window
and watched the lights go by.

01:37:46.419 --> 01:37:48.976
Where were you takin' him?

01:37:49.085 --> 01:37:52.610
Times Square. It was New Year's Eve,
1943. I just dropped him off...

01:37:52.719 --> 01:37:56.913
in the crowd and he walked out of
our lives forever, or so we thought.

01:37:57.019 --> 01:38:01.248
You're tellin' me that you paid 25 grand
for a guy and you lost him in a crowd?

01:38:01.352 --> 01:38:03.546
I did it for my daughter.

01:38:03.653 --> 01:38:06.415
It was some sort of hocus-pocus
she and Johnny were foolin' around with.

01:38:06.519 --> 01:38:08.179
- My daughter was obsessed.
- I know.

01:38:08.286 --> 01:38:10.185
I found a mummified hand
in her room.

01:38:10.286 --> 01:38:14.378
The "hand of glory." It was supposed
to be able to open any lock.

01:38:14.486 --> 01:38:16.975
It was the right hand of a
convicted murderer...

01:38:17.085 --> 01:38:18.746
cut off while his neck
was still in the noose.

01:38:18.852 --> 01:38:21.944
Or so Margaret believed.

01:38:22.052 --> 01:38:25.247
- Black magic.
- Black, white, what difference does it make?

01:38:25.352 --> 01:38:27.342
- Margaret was always--
- Evil.

01:38:27.452 --> 01:38:29.612
Evil is a dunghill, Mr. Angel.

01:38:29.719 --> 01:38:32.515
Everyone gets on his own and
speaks out about someone else's.

01:38:32.619 --> 01:38:36.643
Margaret wasn't evil.
She was a strange kid, though.

01:38:36.753 --> 01:38:39.083
She was into tarot cards
before she could read.

01:38:39.186 --> 01:38:41.483
Who got her started?

01:38:41.586 --> 01:38:43.882
Some maid, governess--
who knows?

01:38:43.985 --> 01:38:47.419
Some maid, some governess-- Everything
you tell me is a crock of shit!

01:38:47.519 --> 01:38:51.918
You're the one that got her started!
You're the fuckin' devil worshipper!

01:38:52.019 --> 01:38:54.282
The prince of darkness
protects the powerful.

01:38:54.386 --> 01:38:57.410
- That's a crock of shit!
- I can't help it if you don't believe.

01:38:57.519 --> 01:39:02.043
You come straight with me, you slimebag,
or I'll save this state an execution.

01:39:02.152 --> 01:39:05.517
I introduced Johnny Favorite
to my daughter. He was very powerful.

01:39:05.619 --> 01:39:08.484
I once watched him conjure up
"Lucifuge" in my living room.

01:39:08.586 --> 01:39:10.280
He was in it much deeper than me.

01:39:10.386 --> 01:39:13.547
He made a pact with Satan.
He sold his soul.

01:39:13.653 --> 01:39:15.381
You expect me to swallow that?

01:39:15.486 --> 01:39:16.646
Swallow it. Spit it out.
I don't give a damn.

01:39:16.752 --> 01:39:20.913
That's a crock of shit, you
lying, old, fucking motherfucker!

01:39:21.019 --> 01:39:24.145
- He sold his soul for stardom.
- For stardom? Are you--

01:39:24.252 --> 01:39:27.912
- That's a crock of shit!
- Satan rose from the depth.

01:39:28.019 --> 01:39:31.180
It was magnificent, except he thought
he could outwit the prince of darkness.

01:39:31.286 --> 01:39:34.844
Johnny sold his soul. Then when he
made it big, he tried to duck out of it.

01:39:34.952 --> 01:39:36.816
That's a crock of shit!

01:39:36.919 --> 01:39:39.750
Johnny came across an obscure rite
in an ancient manuscript.

01:39:39.852 --> 01:39:43.047
- He needed a victim his own age.
- Why?

01:39:43.152 --> 01:39:47.449
To steal their soul. So Toots and Johnny
picked up a young soldier.

01:39:47.553 --> 01:39:48.349
Who?

01:39:48.452 --> 01:39:51.385
Just a soldier celebrating New
Year's eve in Times Square.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:54.043
- Who was this soldier?
- They took him back to Johnny's hotel.

01:39:54.152 --> 01:39:57.517
- That's where the ceremony took place.
- What ceremony?

01:39:57.619 --> 01:40:00.017
The boy was bound naked
on a rubber mat.

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:03.245
There were complicated incantations
and stuff in Latin and Greek.

01:40:03.352 --> 01:40:05.750
A pentacle was branded
on his chest.

01:40:05.852 --> 01:40:09.650
Margaret handed Johnny a virgin dagger
and he sliced the boy clean open.

01:40:09.752 --> 01:40:12.242
And he ate his heart.

01:40:12.352 --> 01:40:15.547
He cut it out so quickly the heart was
still beating when he wolfed it down.

01:40:15.653 --> 01:40:19.643
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

01:40:19.752 --> 01:40:22.481
But before he could work
things out, he was drafted.

01:40:22.586 --> 01:40:25.610
Then Johnny was injured, sent home
without even knowing who he was.

01:40:25.718 --> 01:40:28.311
Who was that boy?

01:40:28.419 --> 01:40:33.681
Only Johnny knew. He sealed the dog tags
in a vase and gave it to Margaret.

01:40:33.785 --> 01:40:36.378
It was Margaret's plan
to drop him off in Times Square.

01:40:36.486 --> 01:40:40.385
That would be the last place that
he'd remember before it happened.

01:40:43.785 --> 01:40:46.514
He needed a victim--
someone his own age--

01:40:49.785 --> 01:40:52.911
to steal their soul.

01:40:53.019 --> 01:40:57.578
And he sliced the boy
clean open and he ate his heart.

01:40:57.685 --> 01:41:00.948
Who was the boy?

01:41:01.052 --> 01:41:05.509
Johnny's plan was to drop out
and resurface as the soldier.

01:41:05.618 --> 01:41:07.744
Or maybe he gained possession
of the guy's soul.

01:41:07.852 --> 01:41:09.342
He still looked like Johnny to me.

01:41:19.085 --> 01:41:20.984
Oh, shit!

01:43:25.052 --> 01:43:26.951
No!

01:43:32.052 --> 01:43:35.281
I know who I am!
I know who I am!

01:43:54.518 --> 01:43:58.350
Alas.

01:43:58.451 --> 01:44:03.044
How terrible is wisdom when it brings
no profit to the wise, Johnny.

01:44:04.718 --> 01:44:06.844
Louis Cyphre.

01:44:08.419 --> 01:44:11.544
Lucifer.

01:44:11.652 --> 01:44:14.744
Even your name
is a dime-store joke.

01:44:14.852 --> 01:44:18.979
Mephistopheles is such
a mouthful in Manhattan, Johnny.

01:44:19.085 --> 01:44:22.314
You think posing as the devil...

01:44:22.418 --> 01:44:26.182
just 'cause it scared some
superstitious old guitar player...

01:44:26.286 --> 01:44:29.980
and that witch
and that nutty old man--

01:44:30.085 --> 01:44:32.211
You think it's gonna scare me?

01:44:32.319 --> 01:44:35.774
It ain't, 'cause I know who I am.

01:44:35.885 --> 01:44:39.818
And you killed them,
and you're tryin' to pin it on me.

01:44:39.919 --> 01:44:43.045
And I know who I am.

01:44:43.152 --> 01:44:46.710
If I had cloven hoofs and a pointed
tail, would you be more convinced?

01:44:48.652 --> 01:44:50.812
You're crazy.

01:44:50.919 --> 01:44:54.216
I know who I am.
You're trying to frame me.

01:44:54.319 --> 01:44:57.649
You're trying to frame me.
Cyphre, I know who I am.

01:44:57.752 --> 01:45:00.651
You murdered them people.
I never killed nobody.

01:45:00.752 --> 01:45:04.015
I didn't kill Fowler...

01:45:04.119 --> 01:45:06.018
and--

01:45:06.119 --> 01:45:08.381
and I didn't kill Toots...

01:45:08.485 --> 01:45:11.748
and I didn't kill Margaret
and I didn't kill Krusemark.

01:45:11.852 --> 01:45:14.375
I didn't kill no one.

01:45:14.485 --> 01:45:17.816
- I'm afraid you did, Johnny.
- My name's not Johnny.

01:45:17.919 --> 01:45:20.011
All killed by your own hand.

01:45:20.119 --> 01:45:22.745
Guided by me, naturally.

01:45:22.852 --> 01:45:26.376
Frankly, you were doomed from the moment
you slit that young boy in half.

01:45:26.485 --> 01:45:28.748
And Johnny...

01:45:28.852 --> 01:45:33.376
for 12 years you've been living on
borrowed time in another man's memories.

01:45:36.952 --> 01:45:39.646
Hey, I'm gonna tell Winesap,
'cause he knows.

01:45:39.752 --> 01:45:43.083
Winesap? Well, he's dead.

01:45:43.186 --> 01:45:44.244
Nasty accident.

01:45:46.485 --> 01:45:50.384
Don't worry. No one will mourn
one less lawyer in the world.

01:45:50.485 --> 01:45:53.714
There's death everywhere
these days, Johnny.

01:45:53.819 --> 01:45:58.310
But what gives human life
its worth anyway?

01:45:58.418 --> 01:46:02.011
Because someone loves it or hates it?

01:46:02.119 --> 01:46:06.109
The flesh is weak, Johnny.
Only the soul is immortal.

01:46:11.785 --> 01:46:14.377
And yours belongs to me.

01:46:18.952 --> 01:46:21.078
I know who I am.

01:46:25.019 --> 01:46:28.417
That's it, Johnny.
Take a good look.

01:46:29.485 --> 01:46:31.679
However cleverly you
sneak up on a mirror...

01:46:31.785 --> 01:46:34.684
your reflection always
looks you straight in the eye.

01:46:34.785 --> 01:46:37.150
I know who I am!

01:46:46.652 --> 01:46:48.210
- Well--
<i>- Girl of my dreams</i>

01:46:48.318 --> 01:46:50.979
<i>I love you</i>

01:46:51.085 --> 01:46:55.518
<i>Honest, I do</i>

01:46:55.618 --> 01:47:03.075
<i>You are so sweet</i>

01:47:04.318 --> 01:47:07.581
<i>If I could just
hold your charms</i>

01:47:07.685 --> 01:47:12.345
- I know who I am!
<i>- Again in my arms</i>

01:47:13.685 --> 01:47:17.243
<i>Then life would be</i>

01:47:17.351 --> 01:47:21.512
<i>Complete</i>

01:47:21.618 --> 01:47:25.517
<i>Since you've been gone, dear</i>

01:47:26.785 --> 01:47:30.014
<i>Life don't seem the same</i>

01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:34.546
<i>Please come back</i>

01:47:34.652 --> 01:47:38.211
<i>With me</i>

01:47:39.351 --> 01:47:43.648
<i>And after all's said and done</i>

01:47:43.752 --> 01:47:48.583
<i>There's only one</i>

01:47:48.685 --> 01:47:52.448
<i>Girl of my dreams</i>

01:47:52.552 --> 01:47:55.815
<i>That's you</i>

01:48:22.052 --> 01:48:23.575
Why'd you come back?

01:48:33.919 --> 01:48:35.818
I live here.

01:48:37.618 --> 01:48:39.676
Who is she?

01:48:41.718 --> 01:48:44.742
She ain't "Angel, Harold."

01:48:47.451 --> 01:48:49.748
She's my daughter.

01:48:49.852 --> 01:48:52.546
Bullshit. Who is she?

01:48:53.952 --> 01:48:57.385
She's Epiphany Proudfoot.

01:48:57.485 --> 01:48:59.975
She stayed here for a little while.

01:49:02.652 --> 01:49:04.846
Long enough for you
to kill her, right?

01:49:04.952 --> 01:49:07.078
Unless that ain't your gun
up her snatch.

01:49:24.385 --> 01:49:26.579
You're gonna burn for this, Angel.

01:49:29.652 --> 01:49:31.846
I know.

01:49:33.652 --> 01:49:35.551
In hell.
