00:54.346 --> 01:01.843
Ad 2133: Peace and order were
disrupted by conventional warfare.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.190
Half of humanity was wiped out,

01:09.319 --> 01:14.484
and many who had been wounded in
the war were revived as cyborgs.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.535
In conjunction with the
establishment of a cease-fire

01:20.664 --> 01:23.326
the neutral city Olympus was founded,

01:23.458 --> 01:26.621
and would later assume a role
of arbitration in global dispuies.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.747
Harmony and order in the world...

01:31.049 --> 01:33.836
Humans cohabit Olympus
along with cyborgs

01:33.969 --> 01:40.215
and "bioroids" - a third race
created from the human genome,

01:40.350 --> 01:43.308
but with certain emotions
like anger and hate suppressed.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.000
Armed criminals have kidnapped

02:12.132 --> 02:14.874
some high-ranking e.U. Officials.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.672
They're barricaded in
an abandoned cathedral.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.386
Motives and demands are unknown,

02:19.514 --> 02:23.006
as well as the number and makeup
of the group.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.472
The local police can't handle it.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.475
Combat cyborgs could also be involved.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.723
Watch yourselves.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.981
We move in at 22:45 sharp.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.521
Synchronize your watches to 22:30.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.107
3...

02:41.244 --> 02:42.108
2

02:42.245 --> 02:43.245
1.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.455
Now!

02:47.959 --> 02:51.543
Cutting-edge cyborg plus analog watch...
Now there's an odd combination!

02:51.713 --> 02:54.671
Its heart beats just like mine.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.336
The sound will get you shot.

02:56.468 --> 02:59.050
You tell him, deunan!
He's your partner, right?

03:04.559 --> 03:07.551
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
You two are meant for each other!

03:28.834 --> 03:31.246
Approaching target.
Drop point confirmed.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.798
Drop point clear. All units, go!

03:47.185 --> 03:49.176
Deploy quickly! No time to lose!

04:38.028 --> 04:40.986
I'm at the outside corridor.
I'm going in now.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.268
30 seconds until we go in.
Everything's ready.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.745
Flash bomb confirmed
inside the cathedral!

05:32.290 --> 05:33.530
Damn that deunan...

05:33.667 --> 05:36.079
Move in now! On a three-count:

05:36.419 --> 05:38.910
3... 2..1

05:45.178 --> 05:46.178
Go! Run!

05:46.346 --> 05:47.346
Right, clear!

05:47.389 --> 05:48.219
There're more above!

05:48.390 --> 05:49.880
Secure the hostage!

05:58.984 --> 06:00.144
Above us!

06:03.822 --> 06:04.982
Are you all right?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.482
Take care of the hostages!

06:08.618 --> 06:09.618
Got it!

07:22.609 --> 07:24.941
They're all cyborgs! What's going on?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.560
You'll have to ask them!

07:45.423 --> 07:47.414
I think that should do it.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.465
What are you after?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.350
Do you hear me? Answer!

07:59.688 --> 08:02.350
All will... be... one...

08:02.482 --> 08:05.144
I am hal... con...

08:07.445 --> 08:09.356
Damn! He's gonna self-destruct!

08:32.095 --> 08:33.710
Are you all right, deunan?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.724
Briareos?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.066
Briareos!

08:48.737 --> 08:49.772
Wait, deunan!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.520
Let go! Let go, aeacus!

08:53.408 --> 08:54.568
Briareos!

08:54.826 --> 08:57.408
Briareqs!

09:28.443 --> 09:31.776
A construction landmate is on
the rampage in sector b-47.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.785
A request has been put in
fo dispatch es w. A.T.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.859
Team 2, head fo the wasp hangar

09:35.992 --> 09:37.528
in delta formation immediately.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.660
Repeal:

09:38.745 --> 09:42.078
A construction landmate is
on the rampage in sector b-47.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.087
A request has been put in
fo dispatch es w. A.T.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.907
Team 2, head fo the wasp...

09:46.044 --> 09:47.534
Commander Lance.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.622
Is this deunan?

09:48.797 --> 09:52.415
I heard the dispatch.
I'm actually right near b-47 now.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.290
Aren't you off-duty today?

09:57.180 --> 09:59.296
Looks like I'm already here.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.433
We'll be there soon. Don't do
anything reckless, deunan.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.446
This is nuts!

10:14.531 --> 10:15.646
Get out!

10:17.158 --> 10:18.694
What's all the racket?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.028
That son of a bitch...

10:20.161 --> 10:22.948
He started going ballistic in the
landmate because he got fired!

10:23.706 --> 10:24.706
Look out!

10:26.835 --> 10:29.201
Come on, run! This way!

10:48.022 --> 10:49.022
Get up!

10:53.862 --> 10:56.069
- Where's the stop switch?
- On his back.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.157
Taking off now.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.869
They all treat me like shit!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.753
Goddamn it!

11:22.557 --> 11:24.047
Take this!

11:28.146 --> 11:29.146
You're late!

11:35.528 --> 11:36.938
Shit!

11:39.115 --> 11:41.276
Now?! I know!

11:44.913 --> 11:46.574
You lousy bitch!

11:50.668 --> 11:51.748
Shit!

11:53.630 --> 11:55.962
Get off me, damn it!

11:56.674 --> 11:58.084
Shit!

12:09.395 --> 12:12.262
Dammit! It's not moving!

12:12.482 --> 12:15.474
What are you going to do?
Let me out of here!

12:17.779 --> 12:21.442
We showed up for nothing, huh?
You overdid it!

12:22.367 --> 12:23.527
So where is the suspect?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.400
He's stuck over there.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.952
That a new guy?

12:29.165 --> 12:31.998
Oh, right... let me introduce you.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.874
You can do that tomorrow.
See you at headquarters.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.299
His name is tereus.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.345
He'll be your new partner.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.570
What's the meaning of this,
administrator Nike?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.902
Watch your mouth, deunan!

13:05.368 --> 13:09.077
Briareos is still in critical condition!

13:09.664 --> 13:11.245
Why at a time like this?!

13:11.374 --> 13:12.864
I already told you.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.622
Tereus has the fighting potential to
fill the opening left by briareos.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.961
That's not what I'm asking!

13:19.590 --> 13:26.837
“Why did we assign a bioroid
with briareos' old human face?"

13:29.058 --> 13:31.390
That's what you're wondering, right?

13:37.859 --> 13:40.100
Come with me, deunan.

13:51.456 --> 13:56.291
As you know, we bioroids are
created from human DNA,

13:56.419 --> 14:00.708
designed for a certain goal.

14:02.759 --> 14:07.378
Unlike humans, bioroid emotions
are suppressed.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.265
The reason why the crime rate
is so low in Olympus

14:12.393 --> 14:16.306
is because we serve to mitigate
conflict in human society.

14:19.150 --> 14:23.484
However, there is still no end
to conflict in the world.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.275
We have therefore decided
to produce bioroids

14:27.408 --> 14:30.241
with high combat capabilities
to uphold public order.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.745
Tereus serves as our test case.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.413
He fights for law and order.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.879
Unlike humans, anger and hatred
will not drive him to fight.

14:49.180 --> 14:54.265
The majority of his genetic code
is taken from briareos.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.930
Why briareos?

14:57.855 --> 15:01.188
After comparing the combat data
of all es.W. A.T. Members,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.935
we found him to be the most
qualified.

15:05.571 --> 15:11.988
And only he has been able to adapt
to the hechatonchires machine body.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.363
His physical and mental
strength are truly remarkable.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.626
You were formerly briareos' partner,

15:22.797 --> 15:26.289
which is precisely why we want
you to assess tereus' capabilities.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.048
I can't agree to that!

15:28.177 --> 15:30.168
This matter has been already decided.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.812
Hitomi!

15:46.237 --> 15:48.398
I just got back from overseas.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.981
I heard about briareos.

15:56.330 --> 15:56.989
Yes?

15:57.123 --> 16:00.286
Deunan, briareos has come lo.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.500
What? Really?!

16:04.005 --> 16:08.590
The plan for the global security network
that we advocate

16:08.718 --> 16:11.801
unites the world's observation and
communication satellites

16:11.929 --> 16:14.341
under Olympus' control,

16:14.474 --> 16:17.966
this will enhance our capacity fo
monitor synchronized terrorist acts.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.113
Say, what's that?

16:37.538 --> 16:38.538
Hm?

16:41.042 --> 16:43.749
Always behind the latest trends
aren't you, deunan?

16:43.878 --> 16:45.618
Come on, don't give me that.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.833
Here, look at this one.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.830
It's a "connexus':
A multi-media terminal

16:49.967 --> 16:54.336
that lets you access the network
directly with your brain waves.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.674
Try it on.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.426
I guess they're like the
next generation of mobile terminals.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.181
No one knows who originally
built them,

17:06.317 --> 17:09.901
but anyone can make a copy using
open-source code available online.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.319
These things are a huge hit
all over the world.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.813
I see...

17:14.242 --> 17:16.699
Open the message on the right.

17:16.827 --> 17:17.987
What is it?

17:19.497 --> 17:20.953
Birthday party?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.492
You have to come, okay?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.253
So how old are you, hitomi?

17:29.423 --> 17:30.754
That's a secret!

17:31.050 --> 17:33.541
Never ask a bioroid her age.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.256
Briareos!

17:40.726 --> 17:44.514
Whoa, hold it right there!
No hugging, all right?

17:44.647 --> 17:45.874
You'd end up breaking him
to bits again

17:45.898 --> 17:48.105
after they just finished
putting him back together.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.603
Go.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.607
At this rate, he'll be out
of here in about a week.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.154
Really?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.114
Briareos is lucky.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.576
Dr. kestner is the head professor
of the Olympus science academy,

18:00.705 --> 18:03.447
and an expert on cyborg medicine.
Your buddy's in good hands!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.915
He's also my primary care physician!

18:07.295 --> 18:08.910
So much flattery...

18:09.422 --> 18:11.253
Well, if you'll excuse me.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.627
What's new with the investigation?

18:19.056 --> 18:23.925
The terrorists were all cyborgs,
like we thought.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.331
After re-examining the five
recent terrorist incidents,

18:26.355 --> 18:30.018
we learned that four had been
carried out by cyborgs.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.937
Terrorist acts carried out by cyborgs...

18:32.069 --> 18:33.434
What are they after?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.941
It's still unclear.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.314
But we do have some clues.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.858
We confirmed abnormal radio waves
in the surrounding areas.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.987
Their patterns closely resembled
a brain-washing virus program

18:44.165 --> 18:45.309
developed back during the war.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.369
You mean they were being controlled?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.667
It's one possibility.

18:49.795 --> 18:54.129
Lots of cyborgs out there
have poorly-protected parts, unlike us.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.626
If someone's plotting terrorist
acts using those cyborgs...

18:58.554 --> 19:00.636
It's a vexing matter.

19:01.349 --> 19:05.137
We have no idea who we're
dealing with or what they want.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.039
You can't afford to be lying
around like this, bri!

19:07.063 --> 19:10.100
Don't be ridiculous. I can't be
out there in this condition!

19:10.232 --> 19:12.894
- So when do these cords come off?
- Don't pull on that, you idiot!

19:14.528 --> 19:17.019
Hey, deunan, give it a rest!

19:17.198 --> 19:18.859
There they go again.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.000
I fixed this for you.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.379
It's tougher than me, huh?

19:37.426 --> 19:41.214
So have you heard about that
guy named tereus?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.050
Yeah, before you came.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.265
Whoever they assign to me,

19:47.395 --> 19:49.761
remember that you're one of a
kind as far as I'm concerned.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.105
Go back, deunan!

21:01.385 --> 21:04.343
- Deunan! Are you all right?
- Briareos...

21:05.806 --> 21:09.469
I'm... alive, right?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.934
Yeah, you're alive.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.351
Thank you.

21:17.067 --> 21:22.812
I'll protect you, even if the
world comes to an end.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.313
Briareos...

22:18.003 --> 22:20.244
I am yoshino, special
representative from Poseidon.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.421
I am Nike, administrator of Olympus.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.167
Prime minister Athena is waiting.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.838
As you see, most cyborgs that
were involved in the terrorist plot

22:30.975 --> 22:33.967
were using parts made in Poseidon.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.597
What is your take on this,
representative yoshino?

22:40.776 --> 22:43.108
We traced the cyborg parts in
question by serial number

22:43.237 --> 22:46.900
to the lab that shipped them out
and shut it down immediately.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.112
Other departments have enacted
countermeasures as well.

22:51.245 --> 22:55.989
However, it would be most regrettable
for you to draw further connections

22:56.125 --> 22:57.911
between the terrorists and Poseidon.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.164
Then you mean to say that
Poseidon has absolutely nothing to do

23:01.297 --> 23:03.288
with this latest terrorist act?

23:04.008 --> 23:08.251
As you know, Poseidon is the world's
largest industrial conglomerate.

23:09.054 --> 23:13.514
Most of its profits come from
trade with other countries.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.884
Siding with terrorists would bring us
no profit whatsoever.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.480
If Olympus were to boycott
products made in Poseidon,

23:21.609 --> 23:23.770
other countries would likely
follow suit.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.151
A devastating blow to our business.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.318
We have issued the same message

23:30.451 --> 23:33.443
to all businesses that may have
been involved in the incident.

23:33.621 --> 23:36.988
We cannot give Poseidon
special consideration.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.749
I believe one topic at the
upcoming international conference

23:40.878 --> 23:43.164
is the matter of Olympus managing
the satellite systems

23:43.297 --> 23:46.630
and enhancing their surveillance
capabilities, correct?

23:55.559 --> 23:59.802
This contains a program to control
Poseidon's satellite network.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.930
Please feel free to use it.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.228
Cutting a deal?

24:05.361 --> 24:07.693
Consider it as a contribution
to global welfare.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.023
I wouldn't expect to hear that
from a business selling tools for war.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.945
Then I ask you:

24:14.078 --> 24:16.820
What is the purpose of the
Olympus' military force?

24:17.206 --> 24:19.697
Do you believe you can protect
the world without force?

24:26.382 --> 24:29.874
That will have to be discussed
at another time.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.462
We'll be looking forward
to a favorable reply.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.410
Oh, thanks.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.251
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, hitomi!

25:06.380 --> 25:07.540
Happy birthday!

25:10.300 --> 25:14.794
I'd like to thank you all
so much for coming tonight.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.425
Please enjoy the party!

25:20.436 --> 25:22.097
Happy birthday, hitomi.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.224
Thank you, yoshitsune.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.437
Who is that hiding over there?

25:31.238 --> 25:34.230
Come on, get over here!

25:42.249 --> 25:44.169
- I didn't even recognize you!
- What a surprise!

25:44.293 --> 25:45.293
Hey, now.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.001
Well, well...

25:54.094 --> 25:56.801
Okay, enough already!

25:58.766 --> 25:59.846
Happy birthday, hitomi!

25:59.975 --> 26:01.090
Oh, thanks!

26:01.226 --> 26:03.182
- Happy birthday, hitomi.
- Thank you.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.263
There are good things in store
tonight for you, too!

26:08.275 --> 26:09.765
Look over there.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.902
What?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.649
Briareos!

26:19.119 --> 26:20.199
So you're okay now?

26:20.329 --> 26:23.116
Not quite... there must be something
wrong with my eye scope.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.288
I'm seeing stuff I've never seen before.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.034
Stop it.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.795
We're also celebrating briareos'
full recovery tonight.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.414
I had no idea...

26:42.142 --> 26:44.474
Happy birthday to you,
vice-=minister hitomi.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.306
Oh, how lovely!

26:47.231 --> 26:48.437
Thank you very much!

26:50.484 --> 26:53.226
Oh, that's right. You haven't
met him yet, have you?

26:53.362 --> 26:55.023
This is tereus.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.154
We meet at last...

26:59.118 --> 27:00.608
Nice to meet you.

27:04.081 --> 27:06.493
Is this supposed to be a
costume party?

27:06.959 --> 27:09.450
There's a guy wearing a mask
of my old face.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.545
I'm not wearing it by choice.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.297
So you've got my attitude, too!

27:22.099 --> 27:23.839
Then we're back in business, right?

27:25.352 --> 27:27.013
Well, about that, deunan...

27:27.187 --> 27:29.394
I want you to stay with tereus
a little longer.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.100
I decided to team up with aeacus
for a while.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.601
What do you mean?

27:35.737 --> 27:39.070
I saw you guys' combat data.
Not bad.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.358
Are you serious? I'm against this!

27:43.036 --> 27:47.370
When I get destroyed for real,
who will you partner with then?

27:49.418 --> 27:50.874
I won't partner with anyone!

27:55.215 --> 27:56.250
Deunan!

28:23.410 --> 28:25.696
Briareos was worried about you.

28:26.955 --> 28:30.698
Whatever! After deciding
everything on his own...

28:35.589 --> 28:37.750
- Gimme another one!
- Make that a coffee.

28:38.967 --> 28:41.424
An Espresso! With a liqueur.

28:43.180 --> 28:48.720
I know you don't like me,
but I'm glad you're my partner.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.726
Stick with me a little longer.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.539
Is something wrong?

29:13.043 --> 29:17.286
Briareos told you my coffee habits?

29:18.048 --> 29:19.208
Nope.

29:33.647 --> 29:34.853
Go home.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.477
Let me take you home.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.142
Leave me alone.

29:41.989 --> 29:45.902
I get confused when we're together.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.784
All right.

30:43.550 --> 30:47.293
Hechatonchires were giants with
a hundred arms, right?

30:47.429 --> 30:49.545
Yeah, the word's from Greek mythology...

30:49.723 --> 30:53.466
The name of a system that
controls countless external terminals.

30:53.894 --> 30:59.230
And you're the only human who
could adopt a hechatonchires class body!

30:59.358 --> 31:02.020
That's how much risk I take.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.235
Sucks, doesn't it? Both of us
bein' cyborgs and all...

31:05.364 --> 31:06.524
No joke.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.565
So, whatcha gonna do, pretty boy?

31:11.244 --> 31:12.984
I'm talkin' about deunan!

31:13.121 --> 31:15.099
There just aren't that many girls
who'll stay with you,

31:15.123 --> 31:17.114
even after you've ended up
in a machine body!

31:18.085 --> 31:21.077
I know. That's why it's hard.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.834
Man, your love is twisted!

31:24.966 --> 31:26.752
And you? You got a girl?

31:26.927 --> 31:27.927
Huh?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.218
How about that earring, huh?

31:32.057 --> 31:35.094
You mean this? It's a "connexus.”

31:35.435 --> 31:38.097
Got it from my daughter.
She's got a matching one.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.855
Still got love from the family
even though you're a cyborg, huh?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.599
Don't be jealous!

31:43.735 --> 31:44.941
Who's jealous?

31:45.070 --> 31:46.560
Hey, that hurt!

32:02.462 --> 32:04.649
The vehicles carrying the
world leaders are now arriving

32:04.673 --> 32:08.291
in front of tartaros international
conference center.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.936
All cyborgs have departed the premises.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.560
We'll continue with the security check.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.608
Deunan, it's about to start.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.495
Right...

32:36.830 --> 32:37.990
What's wrong?

32:40.083 --> 32:42.449
I'm sorry about the other day.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.664
Don't sweat it! I'm your partner.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.921
I've got your back anytime.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.342
Well, that's reassuring!

32:52.471 --> 32:54.302
What, didn't you know?

32:55.348 --> 32:59.341
Under very tight security, the conference
that will forge our world's future

32:59.478 --> 33:01.343
is just about to get underway.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.943
I would now like to open
the security conference.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.333
Prime minister Athena is in.
It looks like the conference has started.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.954
Okay. All stations, stay sharp.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.170
They said it's started.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.093
All right. I hope nothing happens...

33:36.556 --> 33:40.048
Even if something does happen,
it'll be fine because we're here!

33:40.352 --> 33:43.344
Es.w. At. Is the shit, man!

33:48.818 --> 33:51.560
By unifying all countries' satellites

33:51.696 --> 33:54.233
we will be able to reconstruct
the communications network

33:54.407 --> 33:55.772
destroyed during the war.

33:55.909 --> 33:59.652
This will quell conflicts
and terrorist attacks before they happen.

33:59.788 --> 34:04.452
It is the sharing of information
that we now seek.

34:06.378 --> 34:11.918
That was an overview of the global
security network that Olympus proposes.

34:13.092 --> 34:17.507
I would like you all to
put your countries' satellites

34:17.639 --> 34:19.630
under the temporary control of Olympus.

34:21.141 --> 34:23.120
The recent act of terrorism that
occurred in our country

34:23.143 --> 34:26.511
was handled in a very expeditious
manner by the Olympus esw. At.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.293
In order to establish a network
of cooperative relationships like this,

34:29.317 --> 34:30.710
the significance of this proposal...

34:30.735 --> 34:34.226
Well, we have the means to
protect our country from terrorists

34:34.364 --> 34:37.025
without having to rely on
support from Olympus.

34:37.158 --> 34:40.525
Sounds like you have certain
things you don't want them seeing.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.036
Anything you would like to
express further?

34:44.165 --> 34:45.280
We've obtained information

34:45.458 --> 34:47.739
that your country has been supporting
several conflicts...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.746
Ridiculous!
That is an unfounded accusation!

34:49.879 --> 34:53.417
Anyway, why should humanity be put
under the control of Olympus,

34:53.550 --> 34:55.130
which is governed by bioroids?

34:55.302 --> 34:57.132
Silence!
This discussion isn't about race!

34:57.262 --> 34:59.423
Conferences like these are
absolutely pointless!

35:00.432 --> 35:03.299
It's faint, but we've detected
abnormal radio waves.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.050
Abnormal radio waves?!

35:05.186 --> 35:07.472
The source is... scattered around!

35:08.440 --> 35:10.101
All units, be on alert!

35:10.233 --> 35:13.225
Landmate unit, prepare to move out.
Condition 3!

35:15.822 --> 35:17.187
Let's go, aeacus.

35:17.991 --> 35:22.781
Sorry, but you go on ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.489
Are you all right?

35:24.623 --> 35:25.988
It's nothing.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.328
All right. You can go.

35:33.882 --> 35:34.997
Next!

35:39.179 --> 35:40.464
Hey!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.641
Stop!

35:43.808 --> 35:45.469
Stop! I said stop!

35:47.729 --> 35:48.593
Stop!

35:48.730 --> 35:50.812
They're not going to!
It's gonna plow right into us!

35:51.191 --> 35:52.681
I don't care, just shoot!

35:57.906 --> 35:59.771
Explosions confirmed at gate e-12!

35:59.908 --> 36:02.069
Personnel at gate e-12, report!

36:11.252 --> 36:13.334
Aeacus, I'm heading out.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.389
This is tartaros front gate a-2!

36:27.519 --> 36:29.851
Runaway vehicles are heading
into the perimeter!

36:30.605 --> 36:33.392
Gate f, reporting the same situation!

36:34.067 --> 36:36.604
At any rate, do not let
a single vehicle inside!

36:36.736 --> 36:38.897
Send more landmates!

36:39.239 --> 36:42.072
Deunan and tereus, back up
the police in the area.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.737
Keep the terrorists away from
the conference center!

36:45.245 --> 36:46.405
Roger!

36:51.793 --> 36:54.910
The areas around the conference center
are under attack by runaway vehicles.

36:55.088 --> 36:57.579
We'll have to suspend the proceedings
for now and take cover.

36:58.299 --> 37:01.291
There's no need for that.
We'll continue on course.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.929
That's a landmate! Fire!

37:26.953 --> 37:28.568
Even a construction landmate?!

37:39.549 --> 37:41.505
It's not a cyborg...

37:41.634 --> 37:43.966
It's an... ordinary human!

37:52.103 --> 37:53.764
Are you okay, deunan?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.223
Yeah.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.151
What the hell is with them?
They're not just cyborgs either!

38:09.454 --> 38:11.661
There are human rioters, too!

38:18.922 --> 38:20.162
Please hurry.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.002
It looks like riots have occurred
in more than four locations.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.093
Aeacus?

38:30.642 --> 38:33.600
All will... be... one...

38:33.728 --> 38:35.559
I am... halcon.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.020
Aeacus?

38:45.865 --> 38:47.025
What was that?!

38:47.158 --> 38:48.273
It blew up!

38:48.409 --> 38:49.740
Is it terrorists?

38:51.371 --> 38:52.371
Stop the meeting!

38:52.497 --> 38:54.937
- Where's the security?!
- Let us evacuate! This is dangerous!

38:55.041 --> 38:56.531
Quiet, please!

38:57.627 --> 39:02.371
Fear not. I guarantee the safety
of everyone in this conference center.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.131
Gentlemen, please return to your seats.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.009
Let us resume the discussion.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.761
Aeacus! What's wrong? Answer me!

39:14.894 --> 39:16.009
Aeacus!

39:26.781 --> 39:27.941
Stop!

39:32.579 --> 39:34.865
- It's coming down!
- Look out!

39:37.917 --> 39:39.703
Help us!

39:39.919 --> 39:42.410
How can we conduct a meeting
in these kinds of conditions?!

39:46.134 --> 39:50.377
Take a good look! This is
the world we live in!

39:50.930 --> 39:53.797
I demand your decision!

39:54.309 --> 39:57.426
Or do you want more casualties?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.517
Stop it, aeacus!

40:14.120 --> 40:15.951
Briareqs!

40:33.014 --> 40:35.801
All will be one. Understand?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.135
Stop it!

40:46.194 --> 40:47.194
Damn!

40:54.994 --> 40:56.154
Stop it!

40:58.665 --> 41:00.496
Stop it, aeacus!

41:00.959 --> 41:03.996
Briareos!

41:04.712 --> 41:07.124
Aeacus!

41:15.181 --> 41:17.263
Aeacus... why?

41:18.685 --> 41:22.269
Bri... areos...

41:23.231 --> 41:24.721
I.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.866
Briareos!

41:58.391 --> 42:00.382
This thing's a robot!

42:01.102 --> 42:04.265
The abnormal radio waves are
coming from the doves?!

42:07.108 --> 42:10.108
They seem to have the terrorists around
the conference center under control.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.652
Huh? It vanished!

42:14.407 --> 42:16.238
Huh? Hey!

42:17.326 --> 42:19.362
What the heck just happened?

42:22.915 --> 42:26.282
The riots have been suppressed.
There are many casualties.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.410
All abnormal radio waves
have terminated!

42:28.546 --> 42:30.537
The conference has resumed.

42:36.471 --> 42:42.762
The lord called brother aeacus home.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.052
Let us pray for aeacus' soul.

42:46.189 --> 42:50.774
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...

42:52.153 --> 42:58.240
May the lord lead him unto
heaven and Grant him eternal rest.

43:25.186 --> 43:27.347
Do you think I'm sane?

43:28.773 --> 43:34.143
That moment, I felt like aeacus'
melting face was coming towards me.

43:36.405 --> 43:39.363
Maybe I've already lost it.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.324
You're overthinking this.

43:42.495 --> 43:45.487
Everyone recognizes that
you did what was right.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.625
Salute!

44:16.654 --> 44:18.690
What's bothering you?

44:21.701 --> 44:25.410
The hechatonchires system and your
own flesh are so perfectly balanced,

44:25.538 --> 44:28.405
you're like a work of art.

44:28.708 --> 44:33.702
If we can't believe in that,
then no cyborg is safe.

44:34.964 --> 44:37.797
I know what happened to aeacus
came as a shock to you,

44:37.925 --> 44:41.008
but something like that will
never happen to you.

44:43.264 --> 44:46.472
I see. Thank you.

44:49.395 --> 44:50.976
Briareos.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.431
Do vou like this city?

44:58.571 --> 45:03.190
Is Olympus a utopia
that's worth protecting?

45:04.327 --> 45:05.908
I don't know.

45:06.078 --> 45:11.914
But if there's something that needs to
be protected, then I will protect.

45:12.168 --> 45:14.875
Sacrifice and love, huh?

45:15.880 --> 45:20.123
That always makes humans
feel anguish and struggle.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.215
Don't you think so?

45:23.095 --> 45:24.756
No, I don't.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.430
Excuse me.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.594
Good answer.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.676
Although the security conference in
Olympus was struck by a terrorist attack,

45:44.700 --> 45:47.362
the discussion ended successfully.

45:47.495 --> 45:50.224
The world powers moved closer towards
unifying their satellite systems.

45:50.248 --> 45:53.615
It was a testament to Athena's
strong leadership qualities, as well as...

45:55.294 --> 45:58.081
The result of our debate at
the Olympus parliament

45:58.214 --> 46:03.174
is that we will resume normal
trade with Poseidon,

46:03.302 --> 46:05.964
excepting certain cyborg parts.

46:06.472 --> 46:09.009
Thank you for your consideration.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.637
I'll let headquarters know right away.

46:23.781 --> 46:26.093
We have received the report on
the investigation into the attack

46:26.117 --> 46:27.903
on the international conference center.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.866
There's something I'm concerned about.

46:29.996 --> 46:30.996
What is it?

46:31.080 --> 46:35.870
One of the offenders allegedly
mumbled: "I am halcon."

46:37.336 --> 46:39.247
That's impossible!

46:39.672 --> 46:42.254
Halcon is just a ghost from the past.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.249
What could they possibly do now?

47:05.698 --> 47:07.063
Checking ID.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.732
Thank you.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.015
Can I have a match?

47:41.108 --> 47:42.939
Why don't you ask deunan?

47:46.405 --> 47:48.396
I want one with you.

48:30.032 --> 48:30.737
Oh...

48:30.866 --> 48:31.866
Not bad.

48:34.036 --> 48:35.617
Good kick.

48:59.228 --> 49:00.889
Are you happy now?

49:01.981 --> 49:04.893
Guess he really can't beat briareos.

49:05.025 --> 49:08.017
Hey, the bioroid isn't bad either.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.343
We have discovered that the
abnormal radio waves

49:13.367 --> 49:15.904
detected during the
incident the other day

49:16.036 --> 49:18.197
were being transmitted
through robot doves.

49:18.706 --> 49:20.116
We believe they are responsible

49:20.249 --> 49:25.118
for sending the virus program to the
cyborgs and setting off the riots.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.586
However, the fact remains that
non-cybernetic humans

49:27.715 --> 49:30.172
were also involved.

49:30.342 --> 49:33.004
The reason for this is still
under investigation.

49:34.972 --> 49:38.965
We are now certain that this
was the work of cyber terrorists.

49:39.935 --> 49:41.175
We're still investigating

49:41.312 --> 49:44.304
whether officer aeacus
was collaborating with the terrorists.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.522
At the same time, we can't
ignore the possibility

49:46.650 --> 49:49.187
that es.W. A .t.'S virus protection
may have been breached.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.853
Until those issues are resolved,

49:51.989 --> 49:56.323
es.w. A.T. Will suspend the participation
of cyborg troops in our operations.

49:56.702 --> 49:59.535
Wait a minute! Are you just
letting the humans go free?

49:59.663 --> 50:02.154
Why treat us like criminals?!

50:02.500 --> 50:06.163
As long as the enemy's objectives
remain unclear, we have no choice!

50:06.879 --> 50:09.040
That is all. Dismissed!

50:22.561 --> 50:23.892
Yoshitsune!

50:27.900 --> 50:30.061
Will you test this for me?

50:31.654 --> 50:33.315
Some sort of bio-chip?

50:33.447 --> 50:34.925
Does this have anything to do
with the incident?

50:34.949 --> 50:37.782
I don't know, but something
about it has been bugging me.

50:39.912 --> 50:41.493
Okay. I'll look into it.

50:41.664 --> 50:42.664
Thanks!

50:47.753 --> 50:49.118
Tereus!

50:50.339 --> 50:51.795
Let's go get a few drinks!

50:52.341 --> 50:53.956
I'll pass.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.426
A backup follows his point man!

50:58.764 --> 51:00.595
You heard her.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.995
Centralized management of
every country's satellites

51:04.019 --> 51:05.997
along with the proposed system
of information sharing

51:06.021 --> 51:08.083
could mean a first step fowards
fulfilling the wishes

51:08.107 --> 51:10.473
of those who long for peace
in this post-war world.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.474
With this as an important step,

51:12.611 --> 51:14.005
Olympus will undoubtedly
seek to establish...

51:14.029 --> 51:16.270
Hey, where should we go?

51:16.448 --> 51:17.938
Pub or sports har?

51:18.659 --> 51:19.899
Sports bar.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.819
No, pub.

51:32.506 --> 51:38.297
Here it is now... the announcement
by prime minister Athena.

51:38.929 --> 51:45.550
As of now, Olympus controls
482 global satellites

51:45.686 --> 51:48.098
belonging fo 32 nations worldwide.

52:10.210 --> 52:16.422
It's the olive tree, a symbol of
peace and prosperity in Greek mythology.

52:17.885 --> 52:22.379
I am sure people's desire for
peace will unite this world,

52:34.026 --> 52:35.516
It's like some kind of carnival.

52:35.694 --> 52:36.694
Pretty cool.

52:53.879 --> 52:54.879
Briareos!

53:09.228 --> 53:10.559
There's no driver.

53:43.345 --> 53:44.585
That's an information terminal!

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
Briareos!

53:50.853 --> 53:51.853
Stop it, bri!

53:52.271 --> 53:54.262
What's gotten into you?!
What are you doing?

53:58.610 --> 53:59.610
Watch out!

54:00.154 --> 54:01.394
S-stop it!

54:04.700 --> 54:05.700
Tereus?

54:08.203 --> 54:09.659
What's happened to you?

54:09.955 --> 54:11.445
Briareos!

54:11.707 --> 54:14.949
Stop it! Stop, briareos! Hey!

54:24.887 --> 54:27.424
Error detected in
satellite monitoring system!

54:27.556 --> 54:30.298
The electrical supply system
is malfunctioning, too!

54:30.976 --> 54:33.183
We've been hacked into from
outside. Code yellow!

54:33.645 --> 54:35.806
Switch it over to the
sub-system, just to be safe.

54:35.939 --> 54:38.271
Understood. Switching to the sub-system!

55:07.846 --> 55:12.010
The abnormal radio waves haven't
been detected in that area...

55:12.559 --> 55:14.641
So that probably wasn't the cause.

55:15.270 --> 55:19.730
They're going to conduct a drug test
and a psychiatric examination on him.

55:20.192 --> 55:21.682
Where is he now?

55:21.860 --> 55:23.771
In the isolation ward here.

55:23.904 --> 55:25.394
Did you go to see him?

55:27.741 --> 55:30.232
He didn't want to see me.

55:31.995 --> 55:33.326
Oh...

55:38.627 --> 55:39.833
I'll do it.

55:39.962 --> 55:43.045
Okay, I'll let you handle it.

55:48.637 --> 55:49.968
Turn around.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.354
This birthmark...

56:02.818 --> 56:05.184
It's just like briareos'.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.401
What's gotten into him? Briareos...

56:34.266 --> 56:38.760
The debris chip deunan brought
turned out to be part of a connexus.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.394
This is a Guinea pig with
a connexus attached to it.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.021
If I transmit the same signal

56:43.150 --> 56:46.187
obtained from a microchip taken
from one of the robot doves...

56:55.287 --> 56:57.152
Its mind was taken over!

56:57.706 --> 57:00.118
It seems that the connexus
emits a certain frequency

57:00.250 --> 57:02.866
that can affect organic nerve tissue
at an extremely close range.

57:03.003 --> 57:07.872
This can be used to
manipulate humans and cyborgs alike.

57:10.385 --> 57:13.673
That explains why humans were
also involved in the riots, correct?

57:13.805 --> 57:14.965
Yes, sir.

57:15.974 --> 57:18.841
So aeacus was innocent!

57:20.479 --> 57:22.970
He really was just another victim.

57:26.902 --> 57:31.566
So rethinking this, what the culprit
wants isn't simply cyborg terrorists,

57:31.823 --> 57:33.609
but something much bigger...

57:33.742 --> 57:36.905
So the attack on the international
conference center was just a test?!

57:37.287 --> 57:39.699
Please ban the use of the
connexus right away!

57:39.831 --> 57:41.162
All right.

57:44.753 --> 57:48.746
So I really did... attack deunan?

57:53.011 --> 57:55.343
What's gotten into me?

57:56.098 --> 57:58.714
Deunan was very worried about you.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.181
She wants to see you.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.519
Not now.

58:06.525 --> 58:08.607
Is there anything I can do?

58:11.446 --> 58:14.188
Richard kestner...

58:17.244 --> 58:21.704
He has belonged to the Olympus
science academy since 2135.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.080
It looks like he was with
Poseidon before that.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.824
Poseidon?

58:26.378 --> 58:28.209
I want more information.

58:28.505 --> 58:31.212
I'll try accessing gaia's host computer.

58:38.765 --> 58:41.882
Director of technology,
Elizabeth Xander...

58:45.230 --> 58:47.596
Halcon laboratory?

58:47.899 --> 58:48.899
Halcon?

58:48.984 --> 58:50.565
Let me check.

58:55.490 --> 58:56.980
It's been erased?

58:57.409 --> 58:58.990
Is this kestner's handiwork?

59:01.079 --> 59:02.535
Kestner could never erase

59:02.664 --> 59:06.156
all of that data from the
worldwide network on his own.

59:06.293 --> 59:08.124
Something bigger is involved.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.750
Poseidon, then.

59:14.593 --> 59:16.675
Hitomi, cover your ears.

59:18.555 --> 59:19.965
No, briareos!

59:20.348 --> 59:22.179
I'll visit him and make sure!

59:22.309 --> 59:24.721
Please don't do it!
If you do that you'll be...

59:34.154 --> 59:35.154
This way!

59:35.781 --> 59:37.817
What do you think you're doing?

59:37.949 --> 59:39.655
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

59:39.785 --> 59:41.804
I have to go after him!
I have to go after briareos!

59:41.828 --> 59:43.284
Go back to your room!

59:43.789 --> 59:45.905
I have to stop his rampage!

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.257
We're going to run through them!

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.995
Attention, citizens:

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:30.248
The connexus is now considered
fo be a harmful product

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:32.584
attention, citizens...

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:33.918
What's going on?

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.833
What am I supposed to do then?

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.652
- I need mine!
- If you are a connexus user,

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.338
please turn the device in
at your nearest government agency.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.881
We'll probably end up retrieving
less than 10% of them.

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.842
Prepare to take enforcement measures
as early as tomorrow.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.020
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.105
Administrator Nike!

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.224
What is it?

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:56.730
An es.W. At. Cyborg has taken
vice-minister hitomi hostage and escaped!

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:10.535
I'm sure everyone is very well
aware of briareos' power.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:13.037
Do not let your guard down!

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.084
All right, move out!

01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:17.795
Deunan knute!

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.548
Withdraw from this assignment.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.011
Why?

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.423
That's an order. You understand, right?

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.596
Remain here on stand-by.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:27.885
Got it?

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:50.912
Pull your vehicle over immediately.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:52.947
Give up this pointless chase!

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.116
What should we do?

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.459
So we can't go any further...

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:59.087
I repeat: Stop your vehicle immediately!

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:02.044
I'm sorry to have gotten you
mixed up in this!

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.375
Do you have a gun?

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:04.838
I don't need one.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:29.234
We've taken protective custody
of the hostage.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.112
Briareos' whereabouts are still unknown.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.666
Where is briareos?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.585
How would I know?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.129
Why are you asking me?

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:49.927
If you won't tell me, then
I'll just ask myself what I'd do.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:57.721
Briareos took harbor highway 4 and
got off somewhere around cygnus street.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.336
We are checking vehicles within
a one=kilometer radius of the area.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.851
All members work fogether fo
conduct a thorough search.

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:09.736
This is a pretty bleak room.

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.658
You live here all alone?

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.706
No.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.875
I am not alone.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:25.544
What have you done to my body?

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:32.264
Your body can't be controlled by
radio waves from the outside.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:37.181
Your little incident the other day
gave me the perfect opportunity.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:41.848
I added something to that troublesome
hechatonchires body at no extra charge.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.150
Nano machines.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.194
Nano machines?!

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:50.399
They feed off of you.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:58.374
I programmed them to activate when your
adrenaline goes beyond a certain point.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:03.378
The hacking incident you caused
was all part of the plan.

01:04:04.716 --> 01:04:07.924
You see, it was too difficult
to infiltrate the main control room

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.839
of the satellite control center.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:15.136
So I performed a little trick
on their backup system.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:21.472
All that was needed then was
to crash the main system.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.267
And you did that wonderfully.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.653
What the hell do you want?

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:33.283
Do you know why this world
will never be without bloodshed?

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.619
Because of individual differences!

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.455
Different bodies, different hearts...
It's the essence of all conflict.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:46.247
So we must become a single,
united consciousness.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.255
A single consciousness?

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.879
So you provoked
those terrorist attacks?!

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:54.300
I have comrades around the world!

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.510
Put my body back to normal!

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.596
Too late for that.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.978
Itis time...

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:11.780
System error, we are unable to
control the satellites!

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.773
We've lost all satellites links!

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:15.012
What the heck is going on?!

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.430
We're having problems with
the backup system!

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.454
What?!

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:19.828
What are you trying to start?

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.953
Integration and natural selection.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:26.127
What cannot be integrated
will disappear.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.331
Thanks to the connexus and
the satellite network,

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.129
humanity will share one consciousness.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:36.255
A world without misunderstanding or
discrimination will be created.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:40.221
There won't be conflict or war.

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:45.305
Halcon's ideals will finally be reality!

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.431
Halcon?

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.650
The global security network is down!

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.435
We can't control any satellites!

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.312
The global security network is down!

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:56.491
They waited for us to unite the
satellites before stealing them...

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:58.722
Even the terrorist attack on
the international conference

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.907
had been so thoroughly premeditated...

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.283
What if they transmitted that signal to
the connexus, using all the satellites?

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:11.506
Issue an emergency alert worldwide!

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:12.836
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:18.506
Soon you, too, will understand it.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:22.726
A body is just a vessel!

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:29.516
We're going to free our souls!

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.776
Wait! Don't do it!

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.417
I found him! He's right here!

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:56.553
Don't move!

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.424
You're briareos, aren't you?

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.968
We've found the escaped
es.W. A .t. Trooper, briareos!

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.307
One man shot and down.
Send an ambulance!

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.660
Don't move!

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.702
Wait!

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.415
Did he jump?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:32.631
He fell!

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.084
Down there! Chase him!

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.920
The culprit jumped from the window!

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.584
We'll continue our pursuit!

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.256
Briareos is still on the run.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.849
Find him quick and capture him!

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.593
He's in a dangerous state.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.355
If he resists... shoot fo kill!

01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:56.311
I repeat: Briareos is probably
moving towards south on cygnus street

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:03.276
I'll protect you, even if the
world comes to an end.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.292
Yoshitsune!

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.954
Looks like nothing can stop you.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.794
Give this to briareos.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.761
What are these?

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.638
Parasite counters.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.054
They were developed during
the war as a countermeasure

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.743
against cyber-terrorism
caused by cyborgs.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.763
It's a kind of shock treatment.
It will help him regain consciousness.

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.267
If briareos starts losing it again,

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:38.566
shoot this into his nervous system
from the back of his neck.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.649
So this can save him?

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:46.156
It's only an emergency measure,
but still better than nothing.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:57.171
Thank you, yoshitsune.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.067
Briareos!

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.406
I knew you'd come here.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:29.162
So you know exactly what
I'm thinking, do you?

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.906
Just turn yourself in!

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.371
Don't get any closer!

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.211
I'm at my limit!

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:51.144
Briareos!

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.972
Who... are you?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.438
Why is there another me?!

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:05.319
Why've you got what I've lost?!

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.201
All will be... one...

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.079
Stop calling out to me!

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:30.642
Deunan!

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.930
Briareqs!

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.143
Tereus, hold bri down!

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:43.603
Briareos!

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:50.114
It's no use, deunan! Briareos has...

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.111
Don't give me that!

01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:00.662
I swear I'll...

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.252
Bring you back!

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.472
Briareos!

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:19.764
Briareos.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.353
Briareos.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.664
Deunan.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:38.124
You recognize me, right? Bri...

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.746
Thank goodness.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:53.007
Sorry. I'm taking him into custody.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.348
Tereus?

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.804
It's too late.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:43.230
What's going on?

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:54.776
Riots are breaking out throughout Olympus!
We're currently verifying their scope!

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.952
We have lost communication
with the other countries!

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:58.617
Unable to assess the situation!

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.410
Powerful abnormal radio waves confirmed!

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.784
They are being emitted from
every country's satellites!

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:06.337
Is this happening all over the world?

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:10.500
This is... war!

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.712
Es.w. A.T. Will work with the police
to suppress the riots!

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:19.767
They are not terrorists! They're just
civilians who are being controlled!

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:26.017
Try not to hurt them,
but if worse comes to worst...

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:33.694
Bringing the riots under control is
our top priority! Understood?

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.715
Stay back... stay the hell back!

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.383
Shit! How did this happen?!

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:05.972
Control the civilians through their
connexus network to take over the world?!

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.232
That's what the enemy is after?

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.316
Crap!

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:14.814
This way!

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.282
We can't go this way either.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:18.738
There's no end to them!

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.657
We must destroy the source!

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.167
"Halcon"...

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.791
That's what kestner called it.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:31.585
Poseidon is behind this!

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:34.045
They're hiding something.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.032
The ship carrying
Poseidon's special representative

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:38.512
should be at sea nearby!

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.219
Let's go, briareos!

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.343
Tereus, come in!

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.469
Riots are breaking out all over.

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.722
Is briareos in custody yet?

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.689
Report your status!

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.770
This is tereus.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.816
Briareos was...

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:01.034
Shot to death.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.870
Repeat: Briareos was shot to death.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:05.872
There is no need for backup.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:12.664
Thanks to the two of you,
I just told my first lie.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.082
I'm coming, too.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.177
I'm deunan's partner, after all.

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.379
Tereus...

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:29.638
I brought them with me, deunan!

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.902
The estimated size of the riots
is in the hundreds of thousands.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:42.744
They are all moving towards tartaros!

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.371
Hold your positions! Avoid using
deadly force if at all possible!

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:22.442
That's it!

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.624
This is urgent business.
Let's skip the formalities.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.084
I know.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.885
There are just two things
we want to know about.

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.801
What is halcon? Where is it?

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:50.728
Halcon used to be one of
Poseidon's research departments.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:53.472
With professor Elizabeth Xander
as the head of research,

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.940
they developed and programmed
rehabilitation devices

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:01.735
for individuals who had been
handicapped in the war.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:06.661
Using artificial intelligence
and cyborg technologies,

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:09.784
they saved a great people.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.705
They were like gods...

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:19.959
Their self-confidence led them to
develop a distorted perception of peace.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.426
The connexus is another of
halcon's inventions, right?

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:24.466
Most likely...

01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:28.174
The method they use is just
plain mind-control.

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:32.853
We shut down halcon immediately and
dispersed its staff.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.480
Shortly after that...

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:39.484
Professor Xander died in an accident.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.326
You did it all, didn't you?

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.621
The only thing you care about
is protecting your own business.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:56.994
Here's the result of your arrogance!

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:04.005
Where is it? Where is halcon?

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:20.226
This is halcon's maritime
zero-gravity plant.

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:22.611
The facility was sold off a while back.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.400
It should've been converted

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:27.783
into a large-scale
unmanned industrial plant by now.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.953
It's not that far from here.

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:33.492
We're going to halcon!

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.117
Before it takes us over...

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.456
I'll crush it myself!

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:41.213
We have to recover our world!

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.755
We will supply you with the
latest equipment and a task force.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.056
Consider it a good faith gesture.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.517
Arges will handle the rest.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:57.559
We're coming, too.
We're taking off right away.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.626
A human, a bioroid, a cyborg...

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:24.666
Those three are Olympus' hope...

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.436
So what do you think about
Poseidon's latest model?

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.605
It's prototype, but I'll put it
through its paces.

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:46.149
If we can stop the signal coming
from halcon, will you recover?

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.153
Pray that I do.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.159
Our target will be in view
ahead momentarily.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.530
All landmates, prepare to take off!

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.221
This is... halcon.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.227
It's bigger than I imagined.

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:27.687
Halcon's nerve center should be
located in the center of this.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:34.031
We'll escort three of Olympus' craft
to the central section of halcon.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:35.986
We don't know what awaits us,

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:39.536
but we'll end halcon's terrorism
by any means necessary! Got it?

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:51.089
Fortunately, the marine city below
is no longer manned.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:53.796
No need to worry about
innocent bystanders.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.233
It started moving!

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.479
Watch out!

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.111
Dive into the rightward gutter!

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.238
Wh-what the?!

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.240
Here comes another one!

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:21.953
We should reach the central area
after we clear this corridor.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.748
This place is...

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:33.760
So that's the center of halcon?

01:21:40.604 --> 01:21:43.687
Look! A swarm of those drones!

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.939
They're coming!

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.780
Return fire while maneuvering!

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:03.540
If you stop, they'll get you!

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:20.810
Briareos!

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:23.268
What the...

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:28.644
Briareos!

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.484
Stay back!

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.370
Briareos...

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:44.660
Snap out of it!

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.376
Deunan!

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.342
Are you two all right?

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.679
I'm all right... sorry.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:06.595
There's a second wave of them coming!
Everyone - - close formation!

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:10.099
We'll concentrate our remaining strength
on reaching the center!

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:12.609
Tereus...

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:16.105
I only have one dose left.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:19.529
But my nerves can't
handle another dose.

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:24.196
If I go nuts again, it's over.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.871
If that happens, don't hold back,
just shoot me. All right?

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:29.660
Why me?

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.584
I'm counting on you.

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:34.381
Briareos...

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:35.545
Incoming!

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.047
Maintain formation!

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.845
We'll cut straight through them!

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:49.430
That's...

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.692
What have we got now?!

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:18.296
What the...

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.805
Damn! It's fast!

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.337
My bullets aren't even scratching it!

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:43.029
Deunan! Are you all right?!

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:43.741
Yeah!

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.694
Where's the other one?

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:49.125
Over there?

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.292
Bri, tereus, we can do this!

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.002
We'll distract the drones!

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.371
You take care of that one!

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:56.507
Got it!

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.421
Go, deunan! Leave these to us!

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:10.769
Make sure you keep 'em on you!

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.228
You do the same!

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.175
Out of bullets.

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:52.890
Where is it?

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:06.567
I'm not done yet!

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.791
Go!

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:51.661
These guys are amazing...

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:56.166
The central gate is... closing!

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:02.748
I'll secure the gate.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.837
Tereus, you take care of deunan!

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:07.002
I'm one step ahead of you!

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:09.598
Hurry!

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.601
Deunan!

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:16.772
Tereus!

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.055
Let's go.

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:27.401
Tereus, hurry!

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:38.784
We're going to eject and
jump through the door!

01:27:38.962 --> 01:27:39.962
Roger!

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.962
Stay away! Stay away!

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:29.509
Stay the hell away!

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.682
What cannot be integrated
will disappear.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:43.227
No...

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.440
Stop!

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:49.733
Are you all right?

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:51.564
Daddy.

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:52.907
Daddy, get up!

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:56.028
Daddy! Daddy!

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:05.495
Section e police commander, come in!

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:07.838
The surveillance cameras
have been destroyed.

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:09.674
We can't contact section s either!

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:12.840
We have lost monitoring capabilities
throughout Olympus!

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.758
This is Lance. All es.W. A .t. Troops,
report your status!

01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:19.972
Come in! Come in!

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:23.062
What the heck's happening to Olympus?!

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.337
Is that... Xander?

01:29:51.469 --> 01:29:53.460
Kestner and his associates
must have revived her.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:01.931
Briareos!

01:30:07.777 --> 01:30:08.777
Deunan!

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.652
Go ahead and shoot.

01:30:11.781 --> 01:30:18.072
Kill me, and you also lose
all who have merged with halcon.

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:22.907
Including the hechatonchires, of course!

01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:28.291
How can we... stop halcon?

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.047
Give up...

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:36.512
And become one with halcon yourselves!

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:48.192
Deunan!

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:00.493
Briareos!

01:31:00.747 --> 01:31:02.157
Answer me!

01:31:02.499 --> 01:31:03.989
Briareos!

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:25.347
Not like this...

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:35.228
Briareos!

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:39.821
There must be some shred
of humanity left in Xander...

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.286
Deunan!

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:48.283
Help... me...

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.345
People's hearts...

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.717
Aren't something you can just
take away and unify!

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:23.819
Deunan!

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.995
Use this on Xander!

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:36.880
Go, deunan!

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.051
You want to die that badly?

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:52.191
Tereus!

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:57.732
Xander, you and me... we're both
artificially produced people...

01:32:57.864 --> 01:32:59.195
But...

01:33:00.116 --> 01:33:05.452
Our hearts aren't anyone else's!
Your heart is your own!

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.572
Reclaim your true self, Xander!

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.270
Deunan...

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:46.986
I reset all of halcon's signals...

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.571
Xander!

01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:51.663
You're the real Xander, aren't you?

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:58.459
Destroy me while you still can,
and completely stop halcon's systems.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.594
Before the machine
takes control of me again...

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:07.380
Hurry!

01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:12.768
Shoot her, deunan!

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:38.373
Xander...

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:47.342
Now... I can die as a human being...

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.636
Thank you...

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:59.558
I'm sorry...

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:34.179
This is section j-4.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:37.770
The rioters who were heading towards
tartaros have started collapsing!

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:39.681
They have stopped moving!

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:46.154
The abnormal radio waves have ceased!

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:48.648
We've regained control of
the satellite network, too!

01:35:48.785 --> 01:35:50.821
The rioters appear to have collapsed.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:52.819
What's going on?

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:55.697
Have we been saved?

01:36:00.213 --> 01:36:02.579
Are you okay, briareos?

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:05.127
I'm all right, deunan.

01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:08.168
You're really all better now, right?

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:12.295
Well, looks like I wasn't able
to become one with it, huh?

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:17.309
Tereus!

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:20.972
Hang in there!

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:29.981
Let's hurry!

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:53.220
Where are arges and the others?

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.681
It's going to crumble!

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:03.643
Tereus!

01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:07.728
It's okay. Just leave me here.

01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:09.820
Don't be ridiculous! We're comrades!

01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:14.158
I'm a bioroid. They can
make any number of me...

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:15.780
That's not true!

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:18.029
There's no other tereus!

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:20.410
You are one of a kind!

01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:21.999
You know that, don't you?

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:27.873
Arges!

01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:31.717
Hurry! We're out of time!

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:34.595
Come on, tereus!

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:41.390
We can't hold back any longer!

01:37:42.065 --> 01:37:43.771
Let's go!

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.605
We're out of here!

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:22.222
What happened?

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:25.312
Where are we?

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:27.565
Why are we here?

01:38:44.001 --> 01:38:46.538
We must do everything over again.

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:51.672
But we are all still alive.

01:38:53.803 --> 01:38:57.716
We won't give up. We will
look forward and forge ahead.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:01.428
There's still hope!

01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:19.825
Thank you, deunan.

01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:25.990
I'll protect you, even if the
world comes to an end.

01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:30.120
That's my line.

01:39:30.423 --> 01:39:32.288
So you still remembered.

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:33.756
Yeah.

01:39:38.264 --> 01:39:39.674
Are you okay with that?

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:43.508
Yeah, it's all right.

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.976
I'll find someone to protect, too.

01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:51.186
All right, let's take our guests
back to Olympus!
