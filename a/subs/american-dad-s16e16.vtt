WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.923
Ahh, the perfect night
for the Smith family picnic.

00:07.007 --> 00:11.219
I always feel so fancy
walking into a gated community.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.804
Our community, Mom.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.180
We're property owners here.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.598
Hustle up, guys.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.475
If we want to picnic
on the family gravesite,

00:17.559 --> 00:19.436
we need butts on blankets
by sunset,

00:19.519 --> 00:20.812
and we've only got...

00:20.895 --> 00:24.399
one fist...of time, I guess.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.192
Still don't know
how people do that.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.738
Wow!
The view up here is amazing.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.448
It better be.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.451
It's the swankiest neighborhood
in the whole cemetery.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.912
Can you imagine being buried
down there by the restrooms?

00:37.996 --> 00:40.790
That's where the runoff
from our bodies ends up.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.085
And you know we're getting the
leakiest coffins money can buy.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.589
Papa, what is this?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.924
Who is this dark weeper
on our land?

00:50.008 --> 00:52.927
Babe, isn't that
our forever home?

00:53.011 --> 00:56.139
Hey, all our plots are filled.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.099
- What gives?
- Phew.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.895
Mine still looks normal.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.189
All right, I think I may know
what happened here.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.150
Little while ago, I sold
our plots for some quick cash.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.694
I was planning to buy them back
before we needed them,

01:09.778 --> 01:11.821
but apparently,
someone's family

01:11.905 --> 01:13.907
had to go and walk
into a mass tragedy.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.867
Yeah, our family!

01:15.950 --> 01:19.037
Dad, my grave was
the one nice thing I owned.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.538
How could you do this?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.458
To buy the sweet Sea-Doos
we'll all be enjoying.

01:23.541 --> 01:26.127
Soon as I sell a few things, get
some quick cash for a trailer.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.213
But who wants Jet Skis?!

01:28.296 --> 01:29.881
We want our graves!

01:29.964 --> 01:31.466
Hey, there's a lot of pressure
that comes

01:31.549 --> 01:33.510
with being the decision-maker
in the family.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.470
Not every one of them
is gonna be a home run.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.222
Stan, fix it.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.265
How?
This looks like a done deal.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.517
Just fix it!

01:40.600 --> 01:41.851
Let's just get out
of here, okay?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.103
I can't listen
to this shit anymore.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.354
How recent was your tragedy?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.607
Like five minutes ago?

The cemetery owner's.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.814
Okay,
when we get in there,

02:27.897 --> 02:29.649
I want us to be prepared
for the worst.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.442
We may need to take
a worse plot.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.319
You messed this up,
Stan.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.238
You go fix it.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.074
Entrée!

02:39.951 --> 02:42.203
Wh--
You're not Postmates.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.539
Postmates?
Aren't you roasting a pig?

02:44.622 --> 02:46.541
Oh, this?
I just like the smell.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.878
Oh, you're a guest, then.
I love guests.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.838
Take a look around.
Whiff the pig.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.715
I have all the right
and good stuff.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.550
Here.
Touch this old thing.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.677
Can you sense
its temporal immensities?

02:57.760 --> 02:59.262
Uh-huh.
I wanted to talk to you

02:59.345 --> 03:01.389
about buying another plot
for my family.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.099
-See, we ran into a --
-We're full.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.767
-What?
-The cemetery.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.228
It's full up, I'm afraid,
ever since Gwyneth Paltrow

03:07.312 --> 03:09.606
mentioned us as her favorite
summering cemetery

03:09.689 --> 03:11.274
in an article on Goop.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.817
10 Places to Be Buried
Before You Die.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.277
Yeah,
I get the newsletter.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.362
Everyone was begging
to get in after that.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.364
I made millions.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.825
Ooh, do you want to watch me
ride a penny farthing?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.952
I'll need a boost.
And a push.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.496
Uh-huh. But there has to be
something left, right?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.748
Please.
I'm desperate.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.416
Well...

03:28.499 --> 03:31.461
I have two spots here,
but you won't want them.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.255
I'll take anything!
Thank you.

03:34.339 --> 03:37.926
I'm not leaving until I get an
eyeful of you on that high bike.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.929
The plots are in
Pedophile Alley?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.723
But this is only
for confirmed pedophiles!

03:43.806 --> 03:46.809
And if it's only two plots,
how are we all gonna fit?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.436
You can squeeze
with your mother.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.355
The liver disease will
leave her rail-thin anyway.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.523
Preach.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.901
I get this looks bad,

03:54.984 --> 03:56.611
but I'm no sicko.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.696
The cemetery pays me
to desecrate these graves

03:58.780 --> 04:00.156
by peeing on them.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.033
It's the only way
the city would sanction

04:02.116 --> 04:03.743
a burial site like this.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.954
Okay.
Take care.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.081
Camembert, anyone?

04:08.164 --> 04:09.290
What?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.417
You always do this.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.837
You make big dumb decisions
based on big dumb ideas,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.839
and it ends up
hurting all of us.

04:16.923 --> 04:17.924
I'm sick of it!

04:18.007 --> 04:19.384
We're all sick of it!

04:19.467 --> 04:21.261
Well, I'm sick
of all this criticism.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.929
I'd like to see you
do any better.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.556
We can't do any worse
than picnicking on pedophiles!

04:25.640 --> 04:27.016
All right, then.
Be my guest.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.519
My final decision
as family shot caller

04:29.602 --> 04:31.771
is that you can all call
the shots from now on.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.274
Fine. We obviously need
a new place to be buried.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.984
-Agreed.
-Top priority.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.279
But we need money because
Dad spent it all on Jet Skis.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.493
One of my personas
is buried here.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.786
You guys need money?

04:46.869 --> 04:48.454
This place is making
a tidy profit,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.581
and there's clearly
still a demand.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
Is that piss?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.168
God, who keeps doing that?

04:54.252 --> 04:58.089
Maybe this is crazy, but if
we opened our own cemetery,

04:58.172 --> 05:01.175
we could make money and give
ourselves the best plots!

05:01.259 --> 05:02.385
Two birds, one stone.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.096
More like one tombstone.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.808
Tombstone.

05:08.891 --> 05:12.228
Your first big decision
is to open a cemetery?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.896
That is, without a doubt,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.274
the dumbest idea
I have ever heard.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.567
You need land for that!

05:17.650 --> 05:20.069
Well, I think
it's a great idea.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.863
And we already
have the land.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.197
The backyard!

05:23.281 --> 05:24.907
No one ever goes back there,
anyway.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.576
Steve, I apologize.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.369
Your idea isn't
the dumbest anymore.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.537
Your mother's is.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.247
Well,
I think it rules, Mom.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.373
Me too.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.708
Sure, or --

05:33.791 --> 05:35.126
and this is
just another way

05:35.209 --> 05:36.961
we could make money
with the backyard --

05:37.045 --> 05:39.380
poolside club.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.384
We open up cabanas back there
and sell bottle service.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.387
It's friggin' lucrative.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.306
I went to Lindsay Lohan's
Beach Club

05:48.389 --> 05:53.102
and paid $40 for a chicken
Caesar wrap that never came.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.520
And I loved it!

05:54.604 --> 05:56.856
I tipped another $40.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.941
But that's me.
I like to splash.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.406
All right.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.575
Well,
if your remission takes a turn,

06:07.658 --> 06:09.035
you have my number.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.829
Well, that was every
old person I know.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.332
Every one,
healthy as an ox.

06:14.415 --> 06:17.502
Gosh, awfully dead around here,
isn't it?

06:17.585 --> 06:20.922
I guess you could say
this cemetery situation --

06:21.005 --> 06:22.340
Hang on.
I worked hard on this one.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.925
I don't want you to miss it.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.387
Remains grave!

06:27.470 --> 06:31.015
Two puns!
Call me Ol' Stanny-Two-Puns!

06:32.266 --> 06:33.476
Francine?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.894
Did you go in another room?

06:34.977 --> 06:37.146
Okay, we don't have
any business,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.982
and that's not something
we can rub in Stan's face.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.318
We just need some
outside-the-box ideas

06:42.402 --> 06:44.570
for getting bodies
in the ground.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.739
How did that other cemetery
make so much money?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.741
Gwyneth Paltrow
bought a plot there.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.536
Hey, what if we got
an even bigger celebrity

06:51.619 --> 06:53.037
to buy a plot here?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.706
Yeah, but who's bigger
than Gwyneth Paltrow?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.708
I once saw a woman
bigger than her.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.377
In the movie Shallow Hal.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.212
But that turned out
to be her, too.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.047
Let's each take
the rest of the day

07:03.131 --> 07:05.258
to brainstorm
some names.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.806
Scottie Pippen!

07:11.889 --> 07:13.474
And look!

07:13.558 --> 07:16.060
He's coming through town
in a few days on a book tour

07:16.144 --> 07:18.938
of his new Navy thriller,
Deep Danger.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.356
Then it's settled.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.109
We need NBA Hall of Famer
Scottie Pippen

07:23.192 --> 07:26.112
-to save our cemetery.
-Do we, though?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.823
I feel like we're really just
latching onto the first idea

07:28.906 --> 07:30.324
out of the gate each time.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.703
Maybe if we revisit
some other ideas --

07:33.786 --> 07:36.914
Oh, my God, no one is feeling
your pool pub or whatever.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.124
"Pool pub"?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.001
It's a poolside club!

07:40.084 --> 07:41.752
There's so much human fluid
in those things,

07:41.836 --> 07:44.172
you can walk away pregnant
just by swimming through it.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.798
So freaking cool.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.342
You're talkin' a poolside club
back here?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.802
Killer idea.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.221
Thank you!
They won't listen.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.057
They're so horny to get
Scottie Pippen instead.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.019
They're getting Pippen
to save the cemetery?

07:58.102 --> 07:59.896
Damn, that's
a really good choice.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
I never would have
thought of that.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.983
Huh.
Maybe they're right about me.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.943
Maybe I do
make bad decisions.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.987
Stan, do you think
it's possible

08:08.070 --> 08:10.656
that without the family around
to doubt you,

08:10.740 --> 08:12.533
you're starting to doubt
yourself a little?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.203
No way.
Then again, what do I know?

08:15.286 --> 08:18.456
A second ago, I said I liked one
of your ideas, and I meant it.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.124
I mean, that's gotta be
a red flag, right?

08:20.208 --> 08:21.834
No, you were right
to like it.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.003
My idea is special.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.880
I gotta nip this in the bud.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.549
My signature decisiveness
is who I am.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.551
Just gotta make
one really great choice

08:30.635 --> 08:32.094
and see it through to success

08:32.178 --> 08:34.222
to get back up
on that confidence horse.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.973
Oof.
"Confidence horse"?

08:36.057 --> 08:37.517
Where did that come from?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.393
I'm an idiot.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.020
I can fix this.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.481
Just one big decision
that everything can ride on.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.815
That's all it takes.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.777
And that decision is...

08:47.860 --> 08:49.529
poolside club?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.072
Is -- Is that okay?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.740
Are you really
deferring to me?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.075
Yeah, I think I am.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.701
Then mount up, Stan.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.913
Because I will be
your confidence horse.

09:01.207 --> 09:05.545
♪♪

09:05.628 --> 09:07.338
More people
than I thought.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.924
It's fine.
I'm a cucumber.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.802
Just get me close enough
to get a shot off.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.220
I love you so much,
babe.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.596
You brought a gun?!

09:15.680 --> 09:17.348
Jeff, you cannot
shoot Scottie Pippen.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.643
But your mom said we need
his body to save the junkyard.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.271
Cemetery. And we only need him
to buy a plot.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.605
We just have to talk to him.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.774
Next.
What am I signing?

09:26.857 --> 09:29.777
With any luck,
an invoice for a coffin!

09:29.860 --> 09:33.197
Mr. Pippen, have you put any
thought into your burial plan?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.074
Mm, I have been meaning

09:35.157 --> 09:37.493
to get my affairs in order
for awhile now.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.454
Well, we have a gorgeous
little cemetery

09:40.538 --> 09:41.747
we'd love to show you some ti--

09:41.831 --> 09:42.832
Okay.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.625
Oh, right now?
Great!

09:44.709 --> 09:46.669
This little guy's not with you,
is he?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.170
He's got a bad energy.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.590
He's all sweaty
like we're on a date.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.175
This isn't a trick date
with this dude, is it?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.262
Don't worry
about me, Mr. Poppins.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.765
I was just nervous from before
about killing you.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.103
Do you really
have 11 siblings?

10:04.186 --> 10:05.771
How did you guys
go to the movies?

10:05.855 --> 10:09.233
Is the Olympic Village
really just one big sex pile?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.360
How many feet high are you?

10:11.444 --> 10:15.489
Was the set of He Got Game
really just one big sex pile?

10:15.573 --> 10:16.991
I'm sorry
if my family

10:17.074 --> 10:19.118
seems a little starstruck,
Mr. Pippin.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.203
We're all huge fans of yours.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.290
I'm gonna be honest with you.
My book sales are down.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.666
That's why I agreed
to come here.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.002
So, you'll buy a plot?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.545
I can do better.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.090
What would you say
to burying me here tonight?

10:33.174 --> 10:36.469
Everybody make up
their damn minds!

10:36.552 --> 10:38.679
My publisher thinks
I'll sell more books

10:38.763 --> 10:40.181
if I fake my own death.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.892
I'd get a chance to make
the best-sellers list,

10:42.975 --> 10:46.228
and you'll get to lock in
a celebrity here forever.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.689
I would just need to lay low
with you for a while.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.650
So what do you say?

10:50.733 --> 10:54.445
Goodbye,
Scottie Pippen.

10:54.528 --> 10:57.531
And hello, savings!

10:57.615 --> 11:00.660
While other cemeteries may ask
an arm and a leg for burial,

11:00.743 --> 11:02.703
our family business
believes your limbs

11:02.787 --> 11:03.996
should be buried with you.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.331
Unless they were lost

11:05.414 --> 11:07.875
in an industrial accident
or something. Ha.

11:07.958 --> 11:11.170
Down here at Sweet Surrender,
we got deals to die for

11:11.253 --> 11:14.674
and burial sites
for every taste.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.384
From water features

11:16.467 --> 11:19.345
to lush greenery,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.722
we got it all, basically.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.392
And we're excited to announce
starting today,

11:24.475 --> 11:26.727
the only thing lower
than our prices

11:26.811 --> 11:30.815
is the body of NBA champion
Scottie Pippen!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.570
He's dead.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.365
So come on down
to the best little cemetery

11:39.448 --> 11:41.826
in Langley Falls,
Sweet Surrender,

11:41.909 --> 11:44.328
and spend eternity
with Scottie Pippen.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.414
Who is, as we just proved,

11:46.497 --> 11:49.166
dead now.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.085
When did you get a TV
in here?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.921
Um, around the same time
as the whiteboard.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.633
Oh. Okay.
Back to work.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.178
Now, we need a theme
that's going to scream cool,

12:01.262 --> 12:03.264
unique, exclusive.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.433
Good luck
topping this one Stan --

12:05.516 --> 12:08.561
A Night to Remember.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.812
What do you have?

12:09.895 --> 12:12.773
World War I
Christmas Truce.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.442
It's bad.
I hate it.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.319
Hey, buddy, come on.
I like it.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.114
I'm putting it on the board,
I like it so much.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.365
But we'll just know
in our hearts

12:21.449 --> 12:23.117
that we're doing mine,
okay?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.869
Menu items!
Hit me.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.912
Cream-top lasagna?

12:26.996 --> 12:29.623
Did you say spiked soft-serve?

12:29.707 --> 12:30.958
-Did I?
-Yes!

12:31.041 --> 12:34.044
Adult ice cream.
I love it.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.089
We'll call it hard serve.
What do you think?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.382
I don't know.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.925
Great.
It's settled.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.803
Now, suspenders
for the bartenders.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.847
I personally like
the denim ones.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.766
The kind with the buckles
at the tops

12:46.849 --> 12:49.101
and they're, like,
part of the pants.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.561
-Overalls?
-No!

12:50.644 --> 12:52.438
Stan, your ideas
are terrible!

12:52.521 --> 12:53.564
Okay.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.609
Denim suspenders locked in.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.027
Moving on.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.696
We're sorry for your loss.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.657
But take comfort,
your grandmother's coffin

13:03.741 --> 13:06.619
will be touching
Scottie Pippen's for eternity.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.621
It's all she ever wanted.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.415
Cha-ching!

13:11.499 --> 13:13.042
Boy, I thought
the commercial

13:13.125 --> 13:14.919
might help move the needle
a little,

13:15.002 --> 13:16.754
but to fill up in one day?

13:16.837 --> 13:18.214
Wow.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.216
And to think, all these people

13:20.299 --> 13:22.384
wanted to buried next to me,

13:22.468 --> 13:25.137
world-famous novelist
Scottie Pippen.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.848
Oof.
And they're starting to stink.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.391
We should maybe come up
with some sort

13:29.475 --> 13:31.060
of a refrigeration system.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.979
No time. We've got a lot
of bodies to prepare.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.273
You know, we could just
put up the headstones

13:36.357 --> 13:37.983
and dump all these
in the pool.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.569
Seal it over with concrete.
You mean a mass grave?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.489
Yes! Thank you, Steve,
for putting words to my idea.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.659
I love all the support and
positivity without Stan around.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.244
Where's Dad been lately?

13:48.327 --> 13:51.455
And we should have a very chill,
very bored hot lady

13:51.539 --> 13:53.415
in a glass case
behind the bar.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.543
Ugh!
What's that smell?

13:55.626 --> 13:58.379
That's the sweet smell
of success.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.922
Take a whiff, Stan.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.050
The dumbest idea
you've ever heard worked.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.136
Best of all,
we did it without you.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.471
How does that feel?

14:07.555 --> 14:08.556
Bad.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.017
Well...good.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.186
-Dad, are you okay?
-He's fine.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.980
You have to get these bodies
out of here.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.356
Stan and I are doing the bar

14:17.439 --> 14:19.441
-in the backyard idea.
-You're what?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.068
And the health inspector
is coming tomorrow

14:21.151 --> 14:22.820
-to give us the all clear.
-What?!

14:22.903 --> 14:24.488
I can barely believe it, either!

14:24.572 --> 14:26.574
This has been a dream of mi--
Ooh!

14:26.657 --> 14:28.158
How dare you!

14:28.242 --> 14:29.702
Sabotage!

14:29.785 --> 14:31.787
This is a new low, Dad.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
Yeah.
Eat shit, sad guy!

14:33.956 --> 14:38.502
Admit it, you knew a health
inspector would shut us down.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.422
You don't care about
Klaus's stupid thing.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.883
You just want us to fail.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.593
Dad, you want us to fail?

14:45.676 --> 14:46.802
I don't know.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.263
If I do, I'm sorry.
Probably.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.806
At least I think I'm sorry.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.182
Klaus, what am I?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.685
You're on the clock!
Let's get to work.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.104
Look, you've got
your stupid thing going on,

have my good thing,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.233

my employee.

He has napkins to fold!

15:05.529 --> 15:07.323

The President.
On a submarine.

will be here any minute,

with him.

All this work
is honestly not worth it

talking if yaknowwhaddamean.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.434
Yes!
We pulled it off!

19:04.518 --> 19:05.853
I don't understand.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.188
I succeeded, but I don't
have my confidence back.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.315
Well, Stan, it was more
of my success.

19:10.399 --> 19:15.154
Stan, why did you try
to torpedo our cemetery?

19:15.237 --> 19:18.240
Torpedo is a underwater gun.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.034
You said we could decide things
for ourselves,

19:21.118 --> 19:23.704
but when we did, you hated
that we were succeeding.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.205
Of course I did!

19:25.289 --> 19:27.207
You were all doing so well
without me, and...

19:27.291 --> 19:29.001
I got scared.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.503
I started thinking maybe you
don't need Ol' Stanny-Two-Puns

19:31.587 --> 19:34.256
and his dumb decisions
to kick around anymore.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.925
But I swear, I wasn't
trying to sabotage you.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.427
Aww, Stan.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.096
You're more than just
your decisions to us.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.266
You're also the guy we get
to blame when they go wrong.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.809
We need that.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.103
Yeah, honestly,
that was a way easier system.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.773
Dad, we were sorta hoping maybe
you'd take the reins again.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.401
But it seemed like things
were going so well for you.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.028
You don't want to keep
doing your cemetery?

19:56.111 --> 19:57.404
-We hated it!
-So many guts!

19:57.487 --> 19:59.156
I think it's affecting
our groundwater.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.909
Well, I don't want to run
a club, especially with Klaus.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.329
Because you don't want business
to ruin our friendship?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.413
Was that an option?

20:06.496 --> 20:08.749
Baby, we want you back.

20:08.832 --> 20:12.127
But of course,
it's your decision.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.879
I'll do it.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.591
Now, what are you gonna do
with all these bodies?

20:17.674 --> 20:19.134
Yeah, Dad,
what the hell?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
Don't worry.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.345
I got this.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.265
You sure you're okay with this,
Scottie Pippen?

20:25.349 --> 20:27.893
You bet.
The sea will take care of me.

20:27.976 --> 20:31.063
That's why they always
call me The Admiral.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.565
-Wasn't that David Robinson?
-Who knows?

20:33.649 --> 20:37.361
I will return when I have
written my next masterpiece.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.909
See?
Not all my ideas are bad.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.327
I got rid of the bodies,

20:45.410 --> 20:47.704
and we can be buried
in our own backyard.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.206
Two birds, one stone.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.458
More like one tombstone!

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
Another all-timer,
Roger!

20:56.046 --> 20:57.631
Where do you come up
with these?

20:57.714 --> 21:00.133
My spectacular imagination!

21:00.217 --> 21:02.177
What the ffff--

21:02.261 --> 21:04.221
Have a great night!

21:04.304 --> 21:06.306
