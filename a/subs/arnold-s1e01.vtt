to fly over there.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.176
So I was at the Bennett's house in London,

26:35.260 --> 26:37.304
on 335 Romford Road.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.763
I remember it exactly.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.932
And in walked Reg Park.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.898
Meeting Reg Park

26:49.608 --> 26:52.902
was, like,
one of those extraordinary moments.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.491
You see him in magazines.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.910
You see him in movies.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.455
And then all of a sudden, there he is.

27:05.749 --> 27:09.085
He just came from South Africa
and he wants to work out.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.755
And then we're working out together.

27:13.256 --> 27:17.469
I remember that he didn't even…
he didn't even take off his sweater.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.768
And it was just extraordinary
to see Hercules

27:25.477 --> 27:28.438
that you saw in the movies,
to see him in front of you,

27:28.521 --> 27:31.858
and then to have a conversation
and to have him be so nice.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.069
He knew everything about me,

27:34.152 --> 27:36.112
because Wag Bennett told him.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.203
To really motivate me, he said to me,

27:43.286 --> 27:45.497
"If you win the Mr. Universe contest,

27:45.580 --> 27:47.957
I'm gonna bring you down to South Africa."

27:48.041 --> 27:49.834
"And I'm gonna have you
do posing exhibitions."

27:49.918 --> 27:51.920
I'm gonna pay
you for each positing exhibition."

27:52.003 --> 27:55.965
"You can make some money there,
and you're gonna see the entire country."

27:56.049 --> 27:57.634
[adventurous music plays]

27:59.678 --> 28:01.554
[Arnold] There's no room for mistakes,

28:01.638 --> 28:04.432
because I have to be Mr. Universe in 1967.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.396
Wag would say,
"You gotta train your calves."

28:09.479 --> 28:13.274
"Your biceps are much larger
than your calves."

28:13.983 --> 28:16.695
"The calves are skinny,
and the whole proportion is off."

28:18.029 --> 28:19.280
If you want to win,

28:19.364 --> 28:22.742
you need to be fine-tuned
and you have to have everything at ten.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.704
[crowd cheering]

28:27.497 --> 28:29.499
Finally, it all came together.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.169
[announcer] And the winner,

28:34.421 --> 28:35.880
Arnold Schwarzenegger!

28:40.927 --> 28:42.303
[Arnold] At the age of 20,

28:42.929 --> 28:44.681
I made my vision

28:44.764 --> 28:45.890
become a reality.

28:47.976 --> 28:51.312
On that very same stage
that Reg Park won it,

28:52.105 --> 28:55.859
and I got exactly the same trophy
that he got.

28:55.942 --> 28:58.653
And exactly the way I envisioned it.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.364
All the people were screaming.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.824
[crowd chanting] Arnold!

29:02.907 --> 29:05.994
[Arnold] I felt like,
"This is like a fairy tale."

29:06.494 --> 29:08.455
Everything falls into place.

29:25.680 --> 29:28.892
Reg Park invites me to Johannesburg

29:30.477 --> 29:31.728
to stay in his house.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.315
Do you know what that did to me?

29:35.398 --> 29:39.194
I'm getting invited by my idol
to go to his home turf.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.698
[man] I met Arnold when he came here.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.117
I was, uh, nine at the time.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.745
He was very polite. He was well-mannered.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.956
He would wear sandals and socks, you know?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.459
Like a country bumpkin, so to speak.

29:54.959 --> 29:58.713
Lily-white skin.
Everybody on the beach had a tan.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.717
I remember him almost being in awe,

30:02.801 --> 30:05.178
but my dad made him feel so comfortable.

30:05.261 --> 30:08.890
My mother, you know, of course,
made him feel so comfortable as well.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.934
He immediately became part of the family.

30:11.017 --> 30:14.437
We'd go out to meals together every night
and go to movies.

30:14.938 --> 30:19.317
What he really learned from my parents
was how important family was.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.029
I think that impressed him
more than anything else.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.116
My mother gave Arnold some pointers.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.037
You know, he could do the basic poses,
but there was no flow and transition.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.082
So she helped him
put his routine together.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.794
[Arnold] Mareon was a ballet teacher.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.965
She taught Reg
how to be more graceful on stage.

30:42.757 --> 30:46.427
You couldn't get more two opposites.
Ballet is all about grace.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.056
Then you have bodybuilding,
which is kind of blocky

30:50.139 --> 30:51.766
and not much movement.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.103
I didn't understand it all,

30:55.186 --> 31:00.108
but then, as time went on,
I started utilizing what she taught me.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.365
When I was a kid, I was shy,

31:08.199 --> 31:10.201
and bodybuilding

31:10.785 --> 31:13.454
was a sport where you had to perform.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.832
So I could learn it in my own way,

31:15.915 --> 31:17.834
to perform and to pose on stage.

31:17.917 --> 31:21.045
And people then correct you and say,
you know, "Smile more when you perform,"

31:21.129 --> 31:22.088
And do this and do that.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.465
This is how it slowly came about

31:24.549 --> 31:26.217
to become an entertainer

31:26.301 --> 31:29.095
and really enjoying the moment.

31:31.431 --> 31:36.728
In 1968, I went and competed
at the Mr. Universe contest in London.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.813
Every time they called out a pose…

31:38.897 --> 31:42.692
If I did a double bicep pose,
I had the biggest biceps.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.279
Then, when we turned around
and do a back pose,

31:46.362 --> 31:49.198
there's no one that's going to have
this kind of a back.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.785
So I knew I'm gonna win.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.871
[triumphant music plays]

32:01.294 --> 32:05.965
I win the second Mr. Universe title.
I feel, like, at an all-time high.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.594
And I'm about to go back to Munich,

32:09.677 --> 32:11.721
when I get a telegram

32:11.804 --> 32:12.805
from Joe Weider.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.892
I said to myself, "Oh my God."

32:15.975 --> 32:19.854
"Joe Weider?
He's like the godfather of bodybuilding."

32:20.688 --> 32:23.691
The trainer of champions since 1939.

32:24.233 --> 32:26.945
All of the guys that win
Mr. Universe and Mr. World,

32:27.028 --> 32:28.696
they have been trained by Joe Weider.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.615
And it says in the telegram,

32:30.698 --> 32:34.744
"I'm inviting you to come to Miami
to our Mr. Universe competition,"

32:34.827 --> 32:36.287
because there was two.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.415
Weider started a Mr. Universe
in the 60s in America.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.545
I didn't go back home.
I didn't pick up any of my belongings.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.925
I called Albert
and I called Franco and said, "Look."

32:49.008 --> 32:52.512
"I just got an invitation from Weider.
I'm not coming back."

32:52.595 --> 32:54.347
"I'm gonna move to America."

32:54.430 --> 32:55.598
"Bye-bye."

all the American bodybuilders.

the new champion.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.103
Become the greatest bodybuilder
of all times.

He was acting so arrogant and cocky
like the winner, but he wasn't in shape,

and, you know, size with him.

Arnold Schwarzenegger.

This can't be.

and now, all of a sudden, Frank Zane won.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.096
This is terrible. I'm embarrassed.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.602
[Frank] I think he was just
used to winning all the time.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.485
"a chicken with 17-inch arms,"

34:30.568 --> 34:32.403
that really bothered him.

34:35.865 --> 34:37.867
[Arnold] I was so devastated.

34:37.950 --> 34:40.411
I was lying there
in the middle of the night in bed

34:40.495 --> 34:42.205
in this hotel room,

34:42.288 --> 34:44.457
and I thought the world
is coming to an end.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.670
I'm in a strange country.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.589
I cannot communicate here.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.925
I'm thousands of miles away from home.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.344
And I just lost.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.429
I just disappointed everybody.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.683
So in my mind, the bodybuilding world
was going to say,

35:02.767 --> 35:05.686
"Schwarzenegger is not
what we thought he is."

35:05.770 --> 35:06.771
"So fuck him."

35:08.397 --> 35:10.024
I cried the whole night.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.741
The next day, I said, "Okay."

35:18.825 --> 35:21.369
"You cried like a little baby,
you asshole."

35:21.452 --> 35:22.995
"And now, let's move on."

35:25.873 --> 35:29.544
And then Weider gave me an airline ticket
to go to Los Angeles.

35:30.586 --> 35:34.257
He's gonna take care of things
and he's gonna get me an apartment.

35:36.342 --> 35:40.012
I wrote to my friends right away.
I said, "This is quite different."

35:40.930 --> 35:43.307
I felt, like, totally helpless

35:43.391 --> 35:44.475
and alone.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.188
The gyms that I went to

35:49.272 --> 35:52.358
were gyms where
the best bodybuilders worked out.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.694
I come in there and I want to work out.

35:54.777 --> 35:58.197
And there's guys that owned the gym,
like, Vince Gironda,

35:58.281 --> 35:59.740
he owned Vince's Gym.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.951
He says, "You're still a baby."

36:02.034 --> 36:04.704
"We have to get rid of
a lot of fat on you,

36:04.787 --> 36:06.789
but you have a lot of potential."

36:06.873 --> 36:10.543
And I said to myself, "What the fuck
is he talking about? Potential?"

36:12.128 --> 36:14.005
Then I trained at Gold's Gym,

36:14.088 --> 36:17.425
and Joe Gold immediately called me
"Balloon Belly."

36:17.508 --> 36:18.843
I said,

36:19.594 --> 36:20.511
"Jesus."

36:22.180 --> 36:25.892
I realized why it was so important
to come to America,

36:25.975 --> 36:28.686
because they just have
a whole different understanding

36:28.769 --> 36:30.688
of what it means being in shape.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.859
I alone cannot accomplish anything.

36:36.527 --> 36:37.778
I need help.

36:39.155 --> 36:43.743
So I invited Frank Zane,
the guy that I was beaten by,

36:43.826 --> 36:45.786
to come out to California

36:45.870 --> 36:47.121
and to train with me,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.123
because I wanted to see firsthand

36:49.207 --> 36:52.418
what does he do to get
this kind of a quality of a physique.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.838
And I stayed with him
on a cot in his living room,

36:55.922 --> 36:58.090
and we'd go to the gym and train.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.385
Go to the beach. Take pictures for Weider.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.429
I went back to Florida

37:03.512 --> 37:06.682
and resigned my teaching position
and moved to California.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.851
[Arnold] And then,
when I was training here,

37:08.935 --> 37:10.937
especially in Gold's Gym, I felt like,

37:11.020 --> 37:14.899
"Wouldn't it be great
if Franco would see what's going on here?"

37:14.982 --> 37:19.153
I mean, he was my close friend
and training partner in Munich.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.446
I really missed him.

37:20.529 --> 37:24.325
But when Weider heard what his height was,
he had no interest at all.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.662
So he kept saying, "No, I don't want
to bring over a little guy like that."

37:27.745 --> 37:28.579
"Come on."

37:29.163 --> 37:32.166
And then eventually Artie Zeller,
the photographer, and I,

37:32.250 --> 37:33.918
we kind of convinced him.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.963
And from then,
I mean, everything really picked up.
