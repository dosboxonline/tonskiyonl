02:51.922 --> 02:55.327
The Brown Mountain lights are
an absolutely real phenomenon.

02:55.385 --> 02:57.911
It's a probability there is UFOs.

02:57.941 --> 03:00.412
Hundreds of residents are
reporting strange lights

03:00.462 --> 03:02.717
in the skies of Brown Mountain, NC.

03:02.796 --> 03:05.747
When a legitimate Brown Mountain light appeared,

03:05.804 --> 03:08.380
there was electromagnetic interference.

03:08.381 --> 03:10.598
Globs of glowing gas appear,

03:10.610 --> 03:12.838
randomly, in different locations.

03:12.839 --> 03:16.132
Everybody there could see, clearly, what it was.

03:16.133 --> 03:20.019
But that doesn't explain people who
claim they've been abducted there.

03:20.020 --> 03:23.041
It wasn't a sensation. I was physically
sucked up against the ceiling.

03:23.042 --> 03:26.541
It doesn't explain some of the creature
sightings that have taken place.

03:26.542 --> 03:29.489
The lights seemed to move
about, in a ghost-like manner.

03:29.490 --> 03:33.139
It doesn't explain many of
the conspiracies related to

03:33.229 --> 03:35.443
military activities and government involvment.

03:35.443 --> 03:39.587
The US Air force has now dispatched special
operations unit, "Project Blue Book"...

03:51.433 --> 03:53.720
And I think science has an obligation

03:53.721 --> 03:58.025
to explain and to investigate
claims of the paranormal.

03:58.026 --> 04:01.014
It was the most horrifying thing
I've ever felt in my entire life.

04:30.700 --> 04:31.889
Hey, Riley!

04:33.271 --> 04:35.970
- Where is he?
- Riley World?

04:44.412 --> 04:46.914
- Let me see the camera.
- What are you doing?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.834
- All right, give me your camera ...
- What are you doing?

04:50.694 --> 04:53.774
Hey mom .. Can you turn this up, please?

05:30.164 --> 05:33.319
- Sure a good laugh ...
- Corey!

05:36.533 --> 05:38.092
There's more trees ...

05:38.104 --> 05:39.674
Why are we listening to this music?

05:40.113 --> 05:43.338
Because it's bluegrass, son.
It's the sound of the mountains.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.702
- Have you ever done this? I haven't.
- It's a tent!

05:47.730 --> 05:50.652
It's hard! Do you see everything in this list?

05:50.716 --> 05:51.869
Just keep reading your directions.

05:51.879 --> 05:53.781
- OK, guys.
- I'm serious, do you want ...

05:53.837 --> 05:55.808
- Look where we are!

05:56.296 --> 05:59.240
- Setting up camp, for a very long weekend.

06:04.837 --> 06:07.196
- Dad, could you get my sleeping bag?
- Yes, son.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.264
- You get your sleeping bag.
- The green one.

06:09.323 --> 06:11.323
We've got your sleeping bag.

06:11.781 --> 06:13.171
- Just put it in? OK.
- Yeah.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.017
Specimen 1: Common yellow jacket nest.

06:17.485 --> 06:18.405
Corey?

06:18.405 --> 06:20.160
I really don't know what you're talking about.

06:20.516 --> 06:23.457
Specimen 2: Common meathead.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.605
- Here we go, one side ...
- Pull it like a blanket?

06:25.606 --> 06:28.391
- That's better, that's better ...
- Why don't you stay over there?

06:28.409 --> 06:30.806
Done! Boom!
Look at that ...

06:30.813 --> 06:33.000
That was an easy bet.

06:33.023 --> 06:35.276
- Damn straight!
- Honey, I'm sorry ...

06:35.323 --> 06:36.901
Hard to lose, isn't it?

06:37.055 --> 06:39.322
Obviously, their tent's a lot less
complicated than this one, so...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.583
Corey, how are those directions treating you?

06:41.999 --> 06:43.189
They worked out so well.

06:43.209 --> 06:44.346
Oh, really?

06:44.347 --> 06:46.853
Obviously, you people are better suited for this.

06:46.862 --> 06:50.257
- I don't think this is really our finesse.
- It's a female energy thing.

06:50.257 --> 06:51.813
Why don't you guys get us somer firewood?

06:51.813 --> 06:54.018
You're asking for firewood? All right, come on!

06:54.120 --> 06:56.250
Riley, are you gonna go with us or
you're gonna stay with the chicks?

06:58.895 --> 07:01.874
- Wow!
- I make fire ...

07:01.920 --> 07:03.491
Looks good!

07:04.235 --> 07:05.947
Your skill with the lighter, unrivaled.

07:08.919 --> 07:09.919
I am fire.

07:10.788 --> 07:13.398
If we mix my skills with
fire and yours with tents,

07:13.415 --> 07:16.291
we could live out here,
Swiss family Morris style.

07:16.749 --> 07:18.117
No, we couldn't.

07:18.239 --> 07:20.043
Let's just wait till the bank kicks us out, first.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.602
Brown Mountain, elevation: 2725 feet.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.637
This is Jillian, being quiet.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.336
Specimen 3: Some kind of Swallowtail.

07:51.068 --> 07:52.562
Black and green clouded.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.551
Hey, Riley, feel like going for a hike?

08:02.379 --> 08:03.696
We're going for a hike.

08:04.285 --> 08:07.237
- We're gonna go man things.
- If we're not back ...

08:08.657 --> 08:10.286
Watch out for the bears!

08:10.340 --> 08:11.959
Seriously?

08:12.422 --> 08:13.404
Come on, Riley.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.045
The women folk will be fine.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.148
- Where we going?
- I'm not exactly sure.

08:22.444 --> 08:23.725
She's gonna win this one?

08:24.086 --> 08:27.243
We're gonna go up thataway. There's a trail here.

08:28.256 --> 08:30.671
It can't be safe for him to
look through his camera.

08:33.022 --> 08:34.972
He's making me nervous.
Can't you take it off him?

08:35.654 --> 08:36.982
Watch your foot here, Ri.

08:39.513 --> 08:41.001
Riley, check it out.

08:42.024 --> 08:43.794
Amazing rainbow, off the mountain.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.603
You catch any deer?

08:58.658 --> 09:01.026
Yeah, let me throw it down to you!

09:01.847 --> 09:03.231
Hey up there!

09:05.564 --> 09:08.670
How long before Jillian realizes
there's no power for her hairdryer?

09:08.909 --> 09:10.212
One day, tops.

09:11.132 --> 09:14.232
And I'll just trip you, so...

09:14.252 --> 09:15.827
it'll all work out, I guess.

09:15.828 --> 09:19.325
No one is leaving anyone
behind, if a bear attacks.

09:19.487 --> 09:20.309
Boo!

09:20.372 --> 09:23.559
Nope, we're all gonna stick
together and be eaten as a family.

09:26.786 --> 09:28.818
But we do need to put this fire out.

09:35.651 --> 09:37.817
OK, guys, come on. Let's go to bed.

09:39.460 --> 09:42.979
- Come Ri.
- Alright. So many bugs out.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.598
- 'Night, buddy.
- 'Night.

09:46.922 --> 09:49.241
Here. 'Night, baby.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.117
Corey, are you... are you awake?

10:08.215 --> 10:10.929
Riley, go to bed.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.226
Corey, wake up.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.828
Riley, come on. Just close your eyes.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.991
I can't sleep.

10:27.664 --> 10:28.944
It's a moth.

10:29.864 --> 10:31.950
It could be a hawkmoth.

10:55.917 --> 10:56.917
Corey!

10:57.246 --> 10:58.350
Corey, get up! Corey!

11:02.150 --> 11:04.366
- Did you see that?
- Yes, I saw it.

11:11.548 --> 11:12.548
Riley!

11:14.172 --> 11:15.380
Riley, where are you going?

11:16.303 --> 11:17.860
- Riley!
- Shit!

11:17.861 --> 11:18.861
Get back here!

11:19.047 --> 11:20.472
I see lights.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.327
Are those stars?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.265
Look.

11:28.284 --> 11:29.519
Oh, my God!

11:29.690 --> 11:31.065
Stars don't move like that.

11:32.230 --> 11:35.050
- OK, what the hell was that?
- I don't know.

11:36.093 --> 11:37.501
UFOs?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.884
Riley, tell me you got that on video!

11:41.240 --> 11:43.208
- Yeah.
- Dude, let me see it.

11:47.487 --> 11:49.301
...up there and went all the way across.

11:49.589 --> 11:52.277
They were, like, winking and then shot up.

11:52.302 --> 11:55.566
- Yes, we did see the lights but...
- Ah, this is ridiculous, let's go.

11:55.736 --> 11:56.727
- Come on.
- Thank you, Dad.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.195
- Let's go, in the car.
- ... that's so weird.

11:59.398 --> 12:01.681
We can have this fascinating
conversation driving.

12:02.113 --> 12:04.433
It's probably someone's dinner, Riley.

12:04.731 --> 12:06.582
They just haven't chicken fried it yet.

12:07.044 --> 12:09.301
- Don't touch, OK.
- Why would I touch it?

12:09.553 --> 12:12.077
Riley, stop looking at that. We're
getting in the car now sweetie.

12:12.126 --> 12:13.270
Come on, back in the car.

12:14.766 --> 12:15.983
OK...

12:16.865 --> 12:19.720
So, I just want to understand
this whole light thing, so...

12:20.073 --> 12:22.275
What exactly did these lights look like?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.629
Like, flashing and... I mean,
we did see lights last night.

12:24.659 --> 12:28.055
OK. My whole family's going nutty. That's cool.

12:28.727 --> 12:30.391
OK. Ri, move the camera that way.

12:31.090 --> 12:32.453
Thank you, son.

12:32.962 --> 12:34.072
Okey, dokey.

12:35.478 --> 12:38.174
- Next campsite. Whoooo!
- Whoooo!

12:38.211 --> 12:39.651
Yay!

12:40.045 --> 12:42.914
- For how long?
- Honey, I'm gonna plug it back in

12:42.915 --> 12:45.898
as soon as my phone is
finished charging, I promise.

12:46.106 --> 12:49.851
<i>Prepare to exit freeway in 0.5 miles.</i>

12:49.871 --> 12:52.471
- Oh...
- Hmm?

12:53.468 --> 12:55.052
You're getting off the highway?

12:55.740 --> 12:58.562
- Apparently, yeah.
- OK.

12:59.553 --> 13:01.430
I don't think that's right.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.856
My google directions do not have
us getting off the highway, here.

13:03.885 --> 13:08.130
You have to trust Judy, dear. I
use this GPS all the time.

13:08.149 --> 13:08.983
Judy?

13:09.006 --> 13:11.117
Yes, Judy, she's-she's dating Hal.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.930
She knows people and she gets
me exactly where I need to go.

13:13.999 --> 13:16.396
-  You gotta trust that.
- Ahhh! I can't even get service out here.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.846
- Me neither.
- You don't have any?

13:19.485 --> 13:20.321
No!

13:21.040 --> 13:24.624
- Corey, do you have any service?
- He's asleep.

13:24.678 --> 13:28.115
- <i>Approaching left turn.</i>
- OK. Well, here's the turn.

13:30.731 --> 13:33.568
This doesn't seem right.

13:41.653 --> 13:47.477
- <i>Approaching right turn.</i>
- OK, go right. OK.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.292
I don't think I'd wanna get lost out here.
'Cause this is the sticks.

13:55.313 --> 13:57.244
We're fine... I think.

13:57.645 --> 14:00.840
So, that's why we're going down this creepy road.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.586
- It's like 'Deliverance'
- Well, minus the anal rape.

14:06.886 --> 14:08.358
Corey sleeping.

14:10.466 --> 14:11.970
Jillian sleeping.

14:17.401 --> 14:21.242
- Mom, can I sit up front?
- Oh. Sure, honey.

14:22.619 --> 14:25.950
Wow, look at this view, huh? Jesus.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.806
Honey, I don't think there's gonna
be a highway anywhere down there.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.648
I don't see anything down there.

14:43.681 --> 14:46.418
- This is crazy.
- Dad, where are we?

14:48.058 --> 14:50.535
- In the middle of nowhere.
- Look guy-guys...

14:50.556 --> 14:51.286
Are we lost?

14:51.316 --> 14:54.135
We're not lost, we're getting off
this road in a few minutes. OK?

14:54.368 --> 14:56.583
- <i>Approaching left turn.</i>
- See?

14:56.584 --> 14:59.698
Trust Judy. She knows where she's going. Whoa!

15:01.146 --> 15:03.332
This looks pretty lost, to me.

15:07.359 --> 15:10.202
- Dad! Be careful!
- Do you want me to drive?

15:10.203 --> 15:13.771
No, I don't. Thank you very much.
Just try not to piss me off.

15:16.078 --> 15:20.761
- This is, basically, the same road.
- Yes, I can see that, Katie, thank you so much.

15:22.347 --> 15:24.856
Dad, can you please, just slow down?
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

15:24.931 --> 15:26.696
Hey! We're in the goddamn
mountains, alright? I didn't

15:26.717 --> 15:28.514
make the roads. They curve!
What do you wnat me to do?

15:28.591 --> 15:30.161
Peter!

15:31.324 --> 15:34.872
OK, guys. I'm- I'm sorry, but... just back off.

15:34.873 --> 15:36.362
It's hard enough to drive these roads

15:36.379 --> 15:39.287
without you guys badgering me, alright? Please.

15:51.213 --> 15:52.373
It's getting a little better.

15:53.083 --> 15:56.419
It's better? There's hope for the 22 miles.

15:58.513 --> 16:00.710
Son of a bitch!

16:01.845 --> 16:03.803
- What is it?
- We're low on gas.

16:04.007 --> 16:05.007
What?

16:05.769 --> 16:08.444
What? How did we get so low?

16:08.445 --> 16:11.047
What do you want me to say, Katie? We're in
the mountains, the roads go up and down,

16:11.048 --> 16:13.809
we've haven't got gas for a
while. We're low on gas!

16:16.149 --> 16:18.739
OK. Let's all just calm down.
Can you pull over somewhere?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.583
Pull up? Really? You wanna pull over?

16:20.584 --> 16:22.137
What the hell is that gonna
accomplish, pulling over?

16:22.158 --> 16:22.631
Oh, great ...

16:22.632 --> 16:25.274
Oh, yeah, let's not pull over.
Actually, Let's turn around,

16:25.275 --> 16:27.355
- go back to the rest stop and ask...
- We don't need to turn around at all.

16:27.376 --> 16:28.566
- We don't need to do anything!
- Yes, we do!

16:28.567 --> 16:30.523
This thing knows exactly where we ...

16:35.546 --> 16:36.951
What the hell was that?

16:39.057 --> 16:40.402
Is everybody OK?

16:43.723 --> 16:46.318
- Get that goddam thing out of my face!
- Peter!

16:58.166 --> 16:59.980
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.597
Ri, can you put down the camera for a second, hon?

17:15.265 --> 17:16.265
Yep.

17:22.098 --> 17:24.930
- I mean...
- Why would a crow hit our car like that?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.045
I don't know, Ri.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.633
It's balance must've been off or something.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.233
I'm not sure.

17:32.058 --> 17:34.826
I'm really sorry I lost my temper.

17:35.364 --> 17:37.059
I love you so much, kid.

17:43.715 --> 17:45.737
What do you say we go find a gas station?

17:46.933 --> 17:47.933
Sure, dad.

17:52.088 --> 17:54.003
I think your mother's pissed off at me.

17:54.828 --> 17:55.956
Yep.

18:10.178 --> 18:11.598
I'm very sorry.

18:15.449 --> 18:16.670
I'm sorry.

18:23.966 --> 18:25.526
Road to nowhere.

18:29.049 --> 18:30.944
Oh, come on.

18:31.195 --> 18:33.380
There has got to be gas out here somewhere.

18:33.381 --> 18:36.381
- Nobody comes up here.
- Even meth heads need gas.

18:37.490 --> 18:40.728
- Jillian, you asleep?
- Like I could sleep!

18:47.894 --> 18:50.502
- Hey, guys, a mailbox.
- What?

18:52.163 --> 18:54.275
Imagine living out here,
in the middle of nowhere?

18:54.317 --> 18:57.831
- 31... Number 31.
- That's right, Riley.

18:58.282 --> 19:00.363
Isn't that where the 'Unabomber' lives?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.972
31... 31... 31...

19:03.004 --> 19:05.355
Jesus, I wonder where number 32 is?

19:06.602 --> 19:08.157
Cheerful!

19:08.630 --> 19:09.711
That's encouraging.

19:12.961 --> 19:15.122
- I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- So much fun.

19:15.123 --> 19:17.092
I'm actually gonna have a heart attack, I think.

19:17.093 --> 19:18.133
Dad, look at that one.

19:18.837 --> 19:19.961
Don't do that when I'm driving!

19:19.962 --> 19:22.044
Jesus, you freaked me out.

19:22.824 --> 19:24.540
<i>Recalculating route.</i>

19:26.438 --> 19:28.956
- What's it doing?
- <i>Recalculating route</i>.

19:28.957 --> 19:31.412
What the he...? It's recalculating.
Like I took a wrong...

19:31.413 --> 19:32.783
turn or something. I...

19:34.217 --> 19:36.194
- I don't get it.
- <i>Recalculating.</i>

19:36.195 --> 19:39.132
- It's not even sure of its road.
- Because no one uses it?

19:39.133 --> 19:42.280
It doesn't make any sense. There's no signal.

19:42.281 --> 19:45.228
Maybe something is interfering
with the satellite, or something.

19:56.713 --> 19:57.981
<i>Recalculating.</i>

20:03.355 --> 20:05.861
Any kind of signal on that thing?

20:06.619 --> 20:08.104
<i>Recalculat ...</i>

20:08.134 --> 20:10.302
Whoa! What in the hell is this?

20:10.340 --> 20:11.679
What the heck?

20:11.680 --> 20:13.839
Oh, my God. Is that an accident?

20:14.893 --> 20:16.050
Doesn't look like one.

20:23.861 --> 20:25.175
- Is anybody in there?
- No.

20:25.176 --> 20:27.318
- No, no one's there.
- Where are they?

20:27.326 --> 20:28.353
I don't know.

20:29.434 --> 20:30.434
Jesus!

20:35.820 --> 20:38.378
- What the hell?
- What the hell's going on here?

20:39.264 --> 20:41.104
- Whoa!
- Peter!

20:42.131 --> 20:43.058
Whoa!

20:43.372 --> 20:46.575
- This is really weird.
- <i>Recalculating.</i>

20:49.105 --> 20:50.798
Here, look at all this stuff.

20:52.222 --> 20:55.136
- This is just...
- There aren't any people.

20:55.156 --> 20:56.690
OK, umm...

20:56.891 --> 21:00.027
The people who own these
cars have to be somewhere.

21:00.445 --> 21:02.785
Dad, this is really creeping me out.

21:02.876 --> 21:04.789
Yeah, no, I'm with you.

21:07.031 --> 21:09.956
- Maybe we should turn around, now.
- We-we don't have any choice.

21:09.957 --> 21:13.273
We have no gas, we can't get back to
the highway, we have to go this way.

21:14.058 --> 21:16.435
Allright. So, umm...

21:20.195 --> 21:22.744
You guys all sit tight, OK?
I'm gonna find these folks.

21:25.043 --> 21:26.892
- Are you-are you serious?
- Careful, Peter.

21:26.893 --> 21:29.351
- Yes, I'm serious, Corey.
- I'm going with you, Dad.

21:29.352 --> 21:30.113
I'm coming, too.

21:30.134 --> 21:32.195
Guys, I'd really rather you not. I'd
rather you stay in the ca...

21:32.196 --> 21:33.294
OK, that's good.

21:33.495 --> 21:36.339
- Mom, I gotta pee.
- Hold on, honey. I'm gonna come with you.

21:36.340 --> 21:39.759
Riley, you gonna go with your dad? Peter?

21:39.873 --> 21:41.366
- Yeah?
- Keep an eye on him?

21:42.225 --> 21:44.025
- Wait for me, dad.
- Come on, Ri.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.652
Gotta stay close, buddy, OK?

21:49.359 --> 21:51.760
All the seatbelts are torn out of the cars.

21:52.322 --> 21:54.225
This is weird.

21:56.487 --> 21:57.880
Come on, buddy.

22:03.753 --> 22:05.309
Watch your brother, please.

22:05.877 --> 22:10.807
- Who throws their bike on top of the car?
- Ri, come on.

22:28.714 --> 22:29.714
Ri, come on.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.898
How fricking long is this tunnel?

22:36.819 --> 22:38.768
Hello?

22:40.394 --> 22:42.394
Riley!

22:42.415 --> 22:44.257
- I'm coming.
- Come on, buddy.

22:47.924 --> 22:50.812
- Dad, what the...?
- I don't know.

22:53.532 --> 22:54.532
Nothing.

22:55.357 --> 22:58.269
There's just, just... this, shit everywhere.

23:09.539 --> 23:10.722
Hello?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.352
Yeah, dad, this is really weird.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.440
Riley! Come on, buddy.

23:44.529 --> 23:48.442
Dad, Corey... Let's go back.

24:07.796 --> 24:09.043
Riley, come on.

24:13.264 --> 24:14.559
Hold on.

24:25.937 --> 24:29.468
- Dad.
- Ri, shush. Get over here.

24:30.716 --> 24:31.716
Come on.

24:32.136 --> 24:33.336
Whoa!

24:34.691 --> 24:35.879
I mean it, Riley.

24:37.452 --> 24:38.780
Now, stay with me.

24:48.836 --> 24:50.779
- Riley, come on.
- Wait up.

24:54.143 --> 24:55.349
It's a cop car.

24:58.912 --> 25:00.457
It's a Sheriff's cruiser.

25:06.519 --> 25:09.107
I think that we should go back. Let's go back.

25:10.171 --> 25:12.715
Yeah... yeah, we should.

25:18.770 --> 25:19.830
Hello?

25:21.510 --> 25:22.410
Hey!

25:22.430 --> 25:23.630
Dad!

25:25.956 --> 25:27.304
What the hell was that?

25:38.500 --> 25:40.122
Run! Run! Run!

25:40.612 --> 25:42.019
Go! Go! Go!

25:44.500 --> 25:45.655
Let's get behind that car.

25:45.656 --> 25:46.656
Corey, grab Riley!

25:52.280 --> 25:55.466
- Oh, my God, we're trapped.
- Jesus Christ! What was that?

25:58.701 --> 26:00.473
Let's go. Come on!

26:01.620 --> 26:06.277
Corey, now listen to me. I want you to
take Riley and I want you to run.

26:06.543 --> 26:09.610
You get your mom and your sister
and you get the hell out of here.

26:10.188 --> 26:11.188
Are you ready?

26:14.035 --> 26:15.035
Let's go!

26:21.181 --> 26:22.739
Dad! What are you doing?

26:23.595 --> 26:24.869
Shut up!

26:26.913 --> 26:27.913
Ri!

26:27.914 --> 26:29.187
Ri, run!

26:48.080 --> 26:49.089
I saw it!

26:50.345 --> 26:51.870
Corey, run faster!

26:56.970 --> 26:57.970
Can you see him?

26:57.971 --> 26:59.296
Oh, my God!

26:59.297 --> 27:00.735
What are we gonna do?

27:00.736 --> 27:01.754
Run!

27:02.876 --> 27:03.876
Run!

27:04.907 --> 27:06.180
Corey, run!

27:06.484 --> 27:07.854
Corey, run!

27:10.304 --> 27:12.693
Faster! Faster, Corey!

27:15.008 --> 27:18.065
Run! Run! It's coming!

27:18.354 --> 27:21.488
It's coming after me! Run!

27:23.671 --> 27:24.931
Run!

27:26.378 --> 27:28.367
Corey, run! Run!

27:32.111 --> 27:35.100
Get in the car! Get in the car!

27:35.627 --> 27:37.017
GET IN THE CAR!

27:37.246 --> 27:39.862
- Where's Daddy?
- Dad, dad... dad's gone!

27:40.699 --> 27:42.018
- What do you mean, he's gone?
- He's gone!

27:42.350 --> 27:44.070
What are you doing, Corey? Where's your father?

27:44.520 --> 27:46.049
It wasn't human!

27:46.633 --> 27:48.727
Corey? Peter?

27:49.151 --> 27:50.604
- Peter?
- What's going on?

27:50.628 --> 27:51.816
He came after us!

27:54.895 --> 27:57.865
Jillian! Stop! Didn't you hear me? He's gone!

27:57.885 --> 27:59.470
Well, we just have to go get him!

27:59.471 --> 28:00.240
Stop!

28:01.441 --> 28:02.715
There's no signal.

28:04.203 --> 28:06.864
Wait a minute. Turn the car around!

28:06.865 --> 28:07.590
We can't...

28:07.611 --> 28:09.764
Mom! Mom! Mom, please! Believe
me, there's nothing we can do!

28:09.766 --> 28:12.299
- What is going on?
- He is GONE!

28:12.323 --> 28:13.669
We have to get help!

28:14.183 --> 28:17.902
It wasn't human! It was huge!

28:19.089 --> 28:21.835
- OK, we have service.
- Get me out of here!

28:22.092 --> 28:23.640
They tried to trap us in there, mom!

28:23.842 --> 28:25.272
Come on!

28:30.189 --> 28:32.120
Yes! Hello?

28:32.225 --> 28:36.025
Hi, we're-we're lost in-in the
woods and my family is in danger.

28:36.065 --> 28:38.316
We need help right now! Hello?

28:38.611 --> 28:43.785
Hello? No, I don't-I don't know where we are. Can
you send-can you track this phone or something?

28:43.914 --> 28:45.526
Is there some way that you can do that?

28:46.064 --> 28:46.961
Hello?

28:57.314 --> 29:01.304
What's going ON?

29:05.373 --> 29:07.165
What is this?

29:14.049 --> 29:16.901
What happened? Oh, what just happened?

29:19.100 --> 29:20.431
Corey?

29:25.287 --> 29:26.338
What was that?

29:29.270 --> 29:31.270
Shit.

29:31.291 --> 29:34.543
- Shit!
- It's not turning?

29:34.636 --> 29:35.769
Get out! Get out of the car.

29:35.792 --> 29:37.298
Jillian, get out of the car.

29:38.175 --> 29:39.175
Riley, go!

29:40.840 --> 29:41.840
What are you doing?

29:41.877 --> 29:43.314
- We have to keep going on foot.
- What?

29:43.460 --> 29:45.420
We can't just sit here and
wait for them to show back up.

29:45.472 --> 29:48.001
Yeah, we need to keep moving. We gotta get
to a phone or a place where my phone works.

29:48.057 --> 29:49.392
No. I don't-I don't know about that.

29:49.491 --> 29:51.748
Take your stuff. We gotta keep moving.
Come on, Riley.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.063
Come on.

30:02.688 --> 30:03.833
Mom, hurry!

30:05.274 --> 30:06.567
Stay close, honey.

30:07.333 --> 30:08.736
Did we pass that mailbox?

30:09.093 --> 30:11.884
No. Number 31. No.

30:12.533 --> 30:14.783
We'll never make it to the highway, from here!

30:15.068 --> 30:17.036
There's a dirt road, looked
like it coulda been a driveway,

30:17.057 --> 30:19.345
or something. Like
somebody lived back there.

30:21.090 --> 30:23.218
- You doing okay?
- Mom, there's phone lines down here!

30:23.395 --> 30:24.995
Someone must live back there! Come on!

30:25.035 --> 30:26.035
Found the mailbox!

30:33.805 --> 30:34.805
Wait for your brother!

30:35.770 --> 30:36.898
Riley, come on!

30:37.169 --> 30:40.473
31... 31, number 31.

30:40.947 --> 30:42.659
31, 31.

30:45.704 --> 30:47.428
Slow down, I don't see anything!

30:48.415 --> 30:50.175
I'm sure they're out there!

30:52.519 --> 30:55.062
Come on, Riley, don't worry about that.
Keep going!

30:56.191 --> 30:57.459
- Watch your step, honey.
- I got it.

30:57.476 --> 30:58.877
- Where's your brother?
- I got him! I got him!

30:59.349 --> 31:00.057
I'm OK.

31:00.078 --> 31:01.398
- Be careful!
- There's a cabin down here!

31:01.418 --> 31:02.618
- Right here!
- Thank God.

31:05.486 --> 31:06.509
You got it? Come on!

31:08.508 --> 31:10.396
- Whoa!
- Hey!

31:12.763 --> 31:14.727
- Y'all trespassing.
- Sir, please!

31:14.816 --> 31:17.168
- This is private property.
- Holy shit!

31:17.187 --> 31:18.602
Please! We need your help!

31:18.636 --> 31:21.423
I think you best go back up
now where you came from.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.325
Sir, you don't understand. Please!

31:23.346 --> 31:26.378
This is an emergency, we are in trouble.
We need to use your phone.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.619
- What?
- Riley?

31:36.538 --> 31:38.492
- What in the hell is that?
- Riley, come on!

31:39.433 --> 31:41.724
- Get behind me.
- Shoot it!

31:42.860 --> 31:43.698
Go! Go! Go!

31:43.716 --> 31:46.233
Engel! Engel, come back here!

31:47.487 --> 31:50.168
You best get in the house, son.

31:50.539 --> 31:51.577
Come on, get in the house.

31:51.668 --> 31:52.668
Did you get it?

31:52.764 --> 31:54.686
I don't know, I think I might've winged it.

31:57.224 --> 31:59.260
Son, get you that 22.

32:01.642 --> 32:03.276
Look out the front window!

32:07.520 --> 32:09.436
- Where's your phone?
- In my pocket.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.692
You don't have a house phone?

32:10.860 --> 32:13.997
No, I ain't got a house phone, I
got a cell phone like y'all got.

32:14.022 --> 32:15.679
We saw these lines in your driveway.

32:15.696 --> 32:17.335
I got a cell phone, like y'all got!

32:17.732 --> 32:19.222
But it don't work out here.

32:19.381 --> 32:20.381
Engel!

32:20.772 --> 32:23.009
The gun didn't work. It didn't work on them!

32:23.021 --> 32:24.743
It's not gonna stop them!

32:24.922 --> 32:26.371
We're gonna be fine. OK?

32:27.348 --> 32:29.015
Son, you know how to use that rifle?

32:30.366 --> 32:32.110
It's a 'yes' or 'no' question. Gimme that gun!

32:32.164 --> 32:33.757
I got it, I got it!

32:35.639 --> 32:37.197
Son, you best get that camera out my face!

32:37.209 --> 32:38.635
Sir, please! You don't understand!

32:38.653 --> 32:39.924
We need the police!

32:40.538 --> 32:43.559
Well, I don't know what to tell you lady.
It is what it is.

32:44.038 --> 32:46.707
You deep in the mountains.
There ain't no one around here.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.595
Don't you have some way of contacting
someone, in case of an emergency?

32:50.479 --> 32:53.169
Me and my brother do just fine in emergencies.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.996
Let me tell you something.

32:55.511 --> 32:58.463
Even if I could call the law,
they ain't gonna be no help!

32:59.227 --> 33:01.827
Shit! I come out here to get
away from folks like y'all.

33:01.846 --> 33:03.617
Come up here with your dumbass questions.

33:04.513 --> 33:05.753
Well, I got a question.

33:06.746 --> 33:08.236
What in the hell is that thing?

33:09.634 --> 33:11.330
- We don't know.
- You don't know?

33:11.544 --> 33:13.363
Well, you brought it to my backyard!

33:14.383 --> 33:15.814
Riley, show him the camera.

33:16.015 --> 33:16.789
No!

33:17.010 --> 33:19.141
Riley? Riley! Give me... No, it's OK!

33:19.213 --> 33:20.869
- No, it's OK, please just...
- No!

33:20.886 --> 33:23.422
We're gonna turn off the camera for one minute!

33:33.772 --> 33:35.672
What happened to your old man up there...

33:37.651 --> 33:39.883
I lived my whole life up here...

33:40.233 --> 33:42.074
I ain't never seen nothing like that.

33:44.084 --> 33:46.725
And it didn't make sense, what I was looking at.

33:48.412 --> 33:51.209
I suspect them lights'll be back tonight.

34:02.729 --> 34:04.397
I'll do what I can to help y'all.

34:12.704 --> 34:14.335
It's getting dark.

34:15.130 --> 34:16.967
Let's lock down this house.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.380
That's the damn Brown Mountain lights.

34:26.387 --> 34:28.071
Grandmama told me about them.

34:29.170 --> 34:32.193
Said, uh... twelve hundred Cherokee Indians just,

34:32.194 --> 34:34.960
up and disappeared on Brown
Mountain, in one night.

34:36.346 --> 34:37.436
Can you believe that?

34:38.770 --> 34:42.257
Shit. All the stories is the same.

34:43.275 --> 34:46.856
Folks see them lights. Folks go missin'.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.127
Y'know in that video that
your slow kid showed me...

34:51.284 --> 34:53.172
He's not slow, he's autistic.

34:54.759 --> 34:58.960
Well, in the video... that your
autistic kid just showed me,

34:58.961 --> 35:00.778
There's a cop car in the tunnel.

35:01.448 --> 35:02.458
Yeah?

35:02.658 --> 35:04.012
And that's a good thing.

35:04.750 --> 35:08.562
If a cop's gonna go missing, about every other
cop in the state go looking for him.

35:08.563 --> 35:09.563
Yeah.

35:12.613 --> 35:16.241
Well, shit. Law's probably gonna be here
any minute, whether we call'em or not.

35:16.242 --> 35:17.446
I hope so.

35:17.769 --> 35:20.101
See, what we got here is a
perimeter around the house.

35:20.236 --> 35:22.023
Them things come up from behind...

35:23.640 --> 35:25.043
we're gonna hear it coming.

35:26.296 --> 35:28.924
It might be better out there
than with this redneck nutbag!

35:28.945 --> 35:31.119
Shut up! He's right outside.

35:31.153 --> 35:32.624
He's insane and I don't trust him!

35:32.655 --> 35:36.518
Listen, both of you. I don't know who this guy
is and I don't know what he's capable of.

35:36.543 --> 35:40.582
What I do know, is that we have to stay
calm, OK, and we have to work together.

35:40.827 --> 35:42.388
Those things followed us and he's helping.

35:42.414 --> 35:45.514
- We can't just sit here!
- We can't risk leaving now, just calm down.

35:45.924 --> 35:49.406
Sean's brother has a truck, he'll be
back and can get right to the police.

35:51.289 --> 35:53.146
When do you expect your brother, soon?

35:53.663 --> 35:56.978
He's been gone all day. He's heading into town.

35:58.403 --> 36:02.572
Listen, I... I know you folks have
been through some shit today, but...

36:03.410 --> 36:05.301
well, you ain't out of the woods, yet.

36:05.987 --> 36:07.636
Hey, what's this radio equipment for?

36:08.548 --> 36:12.234
That's my father's old HAM radio. Not
really working like it s'pose to.

36:12.848 --> 36:17.148
We basically use it like a CB.
Scott's got a CB in the truck.

36:17.959 --> 36:19.907
So why don't you try calling someone?

36:21.032 --> 36:22.961
'Cause he wouldn't have it
on, unless he had a reason.

36:22.979 --> 36:25.479
Isn't there some way we can use
that thing to call for help?

36:26.306 --> 36:28.476
You're welcome to try it out if you'd like!

36:29.147 --> 36:30.596
If you think I'm lying.

36:31.140 --> 36:33.173
Shit... piss me off.

36:34.127 --> 36:37.276
Son, are you gonna point that
camera at me all night long?

36:38.260 --> 36:40.124
The camera helps him. He needs it.

36:43.060 --> 36:44.236
Yeah, I get it.

36:45.044 --> 36:49.646
I had me a retard cousin once, never let go of his
momma's leg, unless you gave him a wooden spoon.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.955
I ain't no doctor, but...
I 'spect it soothed him.

36:53.405 --> 36:57.228
- He's not retarded!
- I'm autistic.

36:59.848 --> 37:00.748
Hey.

37:01.655 --> 37:05.218
You notice how that camera gets to be
jumping when them things is around?

37:05.774 --> 37:06.774
Yeah.

37:07.164 --> 37:08.247
Yeah.

37:08.634 --> 37:10.828
That happens again, you gimme a holler.

37:11.016 --> 37:12.074
OK.

37:12.594 --> 37:13.494
OK.

37:14.553 --> 37:15.956
Now get your ass out my seat.

37:17.989 --> 37:19.409
What are you doing?

37:19.450 --> 37:22.055
I'm trying to figure out
how this damn radio works.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.607
Sean says it doesn't work.

37:23.750 --> 37:26.604
Yeah, well... Sean can't even
form complete sentences.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.791
I doubt he knows how to operate this thing.

37:29.026 --> 37:30.235
He's got guns.

37:40.776 --> 37:43.832
Guns... and a banjo.

37:52.534 --> 37:54.607
- Something's outside!
- The cans!

38:05.716 --> 38:06.716
Mom.

38:07.100 --> 38:08.493
Mom, what was that?

38:24.238 --> 38:26.020
Oh, shit. It's Engel!

38:26.613 --> 38:28.610
Engel! Engel, here!

38:28.703 --> 38:32.524
Oh, yeah! Good boy. Who's a big man!

38:32.544 --> 38:33.722
Huh?

38:33.723 --> 38:36.229
Yeah, you gave me one for an alien.
You gave me...

38:36.602 --> 38:39.299
- Are you OK, boy?
- Yeah, he looks alright!

38:39.864 --> 38:41.835
Give him something to drink. Give
him some water, or something.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.888
Want some water? Come here, bud.

38:44.122 --> 38:47.013
Well, all we need now is Scott to get back and...

38:47.519 --> 38:49.351
and got ourselves a three men army.

38:50.517 --> 38:51.564
Shit.

39:03.855 --> 39:06.064
Scott should've been back here, by now.

39:07.242 --> 39:09.093
Have you ever seen these things before?

39:14.138 --> 39:16.636
Everybody up here knows
something weird's going on.

39:16.722 --> 39:20.294
I mean, you hear stories, though... I
ain't never seen nothing like that before.

39:22.387 --> 39:24.149
What kind of stories do you hear?

39:28.258 --> 39:29.933
Well, y'all been up yonder.

39:30.517 --> 39:31.940
Seen that cross on the road?

39:32.022 --> 39:34.942
The one with all them dolls and
candles and shit underneath it?

39:34.993 --> 39:36.658
Yeah, we saw it. Yeah.

39:39.430 --> 39:41.272
It was about a year ago...

39:43.320 --> 39:46.859
me and Scott, coming home late at night.
We was out showin' a noose.

39:47.929 --> 39:50.938
That's where we found old Wyatt's
car, right there in that spot.

39:52.934 --> 39:55.764
Doors blown open, lights on, no one around.

39:56.390 --> 39:58.366
Just like them cars you seen in the tunnel.

39:59.429 --> 40:00.429
My God.

40:01.391 --> 40:02.391
Yep.

40:03.093 --> 40:07.304
That whole week, folks was in town sayin' how
they all seen the Brown Mountain lights.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.252
That's wh-we saw lights last night.

40:11.793 --> 40:13.950
I filmed the lights.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.958
Yep.

40:17.377 --> 40:18.846
When them lights show up...

40:19.892 --> 40:21.689
bad shit gets to happenin'.

40:27.370 --> 40:28.591
Why are they doing this?

40:32.828 --> 40:33.936
I don't know, ma'am.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.536
No one knows.

40:39.997 --> 40:41.582
They had the government up here...

40:43.134 --> 40:46.701
with scientists running around
with their fancy machines.

40:48.883 --> 40:50.893
I don't know what these things is.

40:52.538 --> 40:53.774
Y'all fish?

40:55.630 --> 40:56.630
No.

40:59.425 --> 41:01.508
You go out late at night...

41:03.005 --> 41:04.805
when it's real dark...

41:07.513 --> 41:09.189
go to the middle of the lake...

41:11.475 --> 41:13.601
and you getcha a flood light.

41:16.482 --> 41:18.552
You shine that shit at the water.

41:20.138 --> 41:23.159
Than you just... put your feet up...

41:23.952 --> 41:24.952
have a beer!

41:27.583 --> 41:29.218
And you wait.

41:33.858 --> 41:34.989
And you just...

41:35.774 --> 41:39.562
watch how many of them dumbass
fish go swimmin' towards that light.

41:43.664 --> 41:48.291
Shit, you can scoop'em up with a net.
Shit, they practically jump in the boat.

41:52.331 --> 41:54.216
That's all these things is doin'.

41:56.561 --> 41:58.226
They's just night fishing.

42:00.092 --> 42:03.981
Some they keep. Some they throw back.

42:05.756 --> 42:09.118
- Catch and release!
- So, dad could still be alive.

42:09.878 --> 42:13.552
- Corey!
- Hey! Hey, son!

42:13.720 --> 42:16.111
Where the hell you're goin'!
Where the hell you're goin'!

42:16.136 --> 42:18.159
Get your hands off of me!

42:18.894 --> 42:21.360
You goin' back to that tunnel... hmm?

42:21.721 --> 42:24.240
You gonna find that thing, in the dark?

42:25.752 --> 42:27.671
You'll leave your family here?

42:32.959 --> 42:34.465
You're the man now.

42:39.274 --> 42:40.978
He ain't coming back.

42:44.746 --> 42:46.339
I wish he would.

42:49.279 --> 42:51.101
All you can do is...

42:52.085 --> 42:55.808
take care of your family.
But he didn't come back.

43:00.693 --> 43:02.001
Sean!

43:07.491 --> 43:10.572
- Sean, Sean!
- Yeah, Scott!

43:11.094 --> 43:13.292
I'm right here, I can hear you.
Where the hell you at?

43:13.325 --> 43:19.367
Just off the highway, there's these
lights off the road out here.

43:19.946 --> 43:24.576
Don't go near them lights... I
said don't go near them lights!

43:24.641 --> 43:27.568
Jesus! Something is coming up on me!

43:27.744 --> 43:29.291
Scott, what's going on?

43:35.604 --> 43:37.223
Scott, where you at?

43:41.936 --> 43:43.472
The lights!

43:43.859 --> 43:45.334
Scott, where you at?

43:56.278 --> 43:57.435
You can't do this.

43:57.704 --> 43:59.965
This is crazy, Sean! You can't do this!

44:00.355 --> 44:01.882
There's plenty of ammo in here.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.162
Your boy knows how to use
that rifle, if you need it.

44:07.282 --> 44:09.394
Five gallons of gas...

44:09.588 --> 44:12.263
in a can in the root cellar,
which is under that grate.

44:13.843 --> 44:17.360
Nothin' shows up by mornin' you'd best
take that can, you head back to your car.

44:17.369 --> 44:19.396
It's gonna be enough for you
to get you as far as town.

44:19.503 --> 44:20.870
Just stop and think!

44:21.224 --> 44:22.825
- You can't leave us!
- Engel, here!

44:22.864 --> 44:25.295
Sean, you're not even sober.
You're gonna get yourself killed!

44:26.406 --> 44:28.364
It's my brother out there.

44:31.762 --> 44:34.561
Now, if I get killed, I get killed.

44:37.670 --> 44:42.139
Now y'all be safe. And take
care of your children.

44:42.916 --> 44:44.982
Did you hear that, son?

44:45.829 --> 44:47.922
You take care of this family.

44:49.239 --> 44:51.343
- Come on.
- I can't believe it.

44:53.921 --> 44:55.309
Mom.

45:01.776 --> 45:04.518
Mom, I don't wanna be here any more.

45:04.550 --> 45:06.993
- I wanna go home.
- Me, too, honey.

45:07.758 --> 45:09.545
We're safe here, right now.

45:10.060 --> 45:12.164
As soon as it gets light we're
gonna grab that gas can...

45:12.165 --> 45:14.569
and we're gonna go right back to our car.

45:15.547 --> 45:16.547
Yeah.

45:26.279 --> 45:27.279
Corey...

45:28.324 --> 45:29.379
You OK?

45:37.420 --> 45:40.573
It happened... so fast.

45:42.414 --> 45:44.293
It was right on top of us.

45:46.660 --> 45:51.166
Mommy, I can still hear his screams in my head!
I can't get them out!

45:53.943 --> 45:56.975
I didn't do anything!

45:58.958 --> 46:00.843
- Wait a minute...
- Damn it!

46:00.844 --> 46:05.951
I was so afraid that I just ran!
I didn't do anything!

46:06.251 --> 46:08.986
It's not what happened. You
did the best that you could.

46:08.987 --> 46:10.807
I should've try to fight it!

46:10.808 --> 46:15.654
I could've-I could've tried to punch
it or find something to hit it with.

46:17.987 --> 46:22.039
- I don't deserve to make it through this!
- Corey! Stop it! Stop it!

46:23.721 --> 46:28.423
Please, honey, I need you to stay strong.
Help get us through this, please.

46:29.067 --> 46:31.390
I am so proud of you.

46:41.993 --> 46:42.893
Hey.

46:50.114 --> 46:52.725
- Dad...
- I know.

46:53.178 --> 46:56.280
Do you think you could try to get some sleep?

46:57.606 --> 47:01.107
You're tired. We're all tired.

47:03.074 --> 47:05.990
I'm gonna get us out of here. I promise you.

47:12.559 --> 47:14.703
Now you get some sleep, honey.

47:25.445 --> 47:27.312
Jillian! Jillian, wake up!

47:28.489 --> 47:29.851
What is it, Riley?

47:31.939 --> 47:33.952
- They're back.
- Mom. Oh, my God.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.562
- Something's out there!
- Jillian, get away from there!

47:38.239 --> 47:40.794
- Jillian, what is that?
- I don't know, something white!

47:40.795 --> 47:42.326
Corey, back!

47:43.406 --> 47:45.166
Corey, back!

47:45.617 --> 47:47.806
What is that?

47:47.807 --> 47:51.724
- I think it's moving.
- What? No! No! No!

47:53.729 --> 47:56.658
There's a... Look! Look!

47:57.570 --> 47:59.784
Is it watching us?

48:02.898 --> 48:05.594
We gotta get out of here! Alright, come ...

48:10.677 --> 48:12.677
THERE THEY ARE!

48:14.056 --> 48:15.670
Oh, my God!

48:17.326 --> 48:18.638
Go! Go! Go!

48:36.520 --> 48:37.993
What was that?

48:56.276 --> 48:59.176
- They're all around us. The door!
- We can't get out!

49:01.751 --> 49:03.274
Quick, Riley!

49:08.024 --> 49:09.252
Riley? Riley.

49:10.001 --> 49:12.938
Corey? Where are you...?
Corey, what are you doing?

49:13.224 --> 49:16.963
- Corey! Corey!
- I love you guys. It's the only way!

49:17.251 --> 49:21.562
- No! Wait!
- Corey, come down!

49:24.311 --> 49:27.943
Please! Please, Corey!

51:11.108 --> 51:12.399
Mom.

51:14.252 --> 51:15.929
We have to get out of here.

51:17.502 --> 51:19.084
I cannot...

51:26.345 --> 51:28.492
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you two.

51:29.902 --> 51:31.632
This is the only way out.

51:32.409 --> 51:34.127
We have to lift this couch.

51:42.879 --> 51:44.313
Shit!

51:48.360 --> 51:50.702
I can't get any leverage.

51:52.959 --> 51:56.384
Shhh! The camera!

52:08.456 --> 52:10.456
I'm scared.

52:19.476 --> 52:20.876
Oh, come on.

53:41.292 --> 53:45.427
Y'all gon' follow me. Ain't
safe here no more. Come on!

53:45.439 --> 53:48.697
They took him, Sean! They took my son!

53:53.763 --> 53:55.623
Come on, little man. Come on.

53:59.452 --> 54:00.975
Shit!

54:01.985 --> 54:05.394
- Did you find your brother?
- Just his empty truck.

54:05.503 --> 54:08.468
Here, take that in the back. Be careful with it.

54:09.110 --> 54:11.177
Get in! We gotta go.

54:11.284 --> 54:14.936
We're takin' the back roads. It's gonna get rough.

54:15.626 --> 54:17.605
- Riley?
- Right here.

54:17.770 --> 54:18.944
Hold on!

54:22.757 --> 54:25.985
Scott's truck was still running.
Doors blown open.

54:26.137 --> 54:28.027
I don't know where I could find him.

54:29.541 --> 54:32.494
- He wouldn't have left his gun.
- Sean, where're we going?

54:32.881 --> 54:35.825
Those things is all over the main roads.

54:35.946 --> 54:38.593
I know these trails like the back of my hand.

54:39.349 --> 54:42.413
I'll get us out of here, down the mountain.

54:43.169 --> 54:44.884
Is that where the town is?

54:44.950 --> 54:48.696
Town's 30 miles from here, and they might
be down there, too, for all I know.

54:49.478 --> 54:53.715
Some lights floated, like, ten feet off
the ground, right near Scott's truck.

54:54.099 --> 54:56.169
Shit! Might be a goddamn invasion.

54:56.886 --> 54:58.474
Thank you for coming back for us.

54:59.378 --> 55:00.704
Yeah, don't mention it.

55:03.426 --> 55:04.794
Shit!

55:06.652 --> 55:08.957
Alright, listen to me. Listen to me!

55:09.336 --> 55:11.888
Y'all gotta get out the truck.
You head that way...

55:12.066 --> 55:13.972
you'll find a footpath, at the edge of the woods.

55:14.022 --> 55:16.698
Take the footpath, it's gonna
drop you off right by the barn.

55:16.746 --> 55:18.806
Y'all get in that barn and y'all hide.

55:18.909 --> 55:21.070
- I'll try and draw'em off on this side.
- Come with us!

55:21.119 --> 55:24.150
Get out of the truck now! Go! Get outta here!

55:24.177 --> 55:25.454
Come with us!

55:41.520 --> 55:44.324
Mom, here's the walkway! Come on!

56:03.797 --> 56:05.396
Mom, wait, hold up.

56:07.786 --> 56:09.382
Did he say which way?

56:18.202 --> 56:20.202
It knows where we are!

56:35.776 --> 56:37.196
Let's keep moving.

56:39.559 --> 56:42.340
OK. Come on, honey.

56:45.595 --> 56:46.595
Shhh!

56:47.377 --> 56:50.167
Stay low. Stick together.

56:55.926 --> 56:59.188
- Stay with me.
- Riley! Hurry!

56:59.298 --> 57:00.869
I'm trying.

57:13.435 --> 57:14.746
Keep up.

57:48.200 --> 57:49.706
Careful, Jillian.

58:08.828 --> 58:10.122
Mom!

58:13.501 --> 58:15.897
- Come here.
- The lights.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.680
The lights are moving.

58:21.027 --> 58:22.831
Get down! Get down!

58:23.532 --> 58:27.451
I can't see what it is. Is it coming closer?

58:31.422 --> 58:34.118
Yes.

58:48.338 --> 58:50.069
What is that? What is that?

58:53.640 --> 58:56.494
- Oh, my God!
- Riley, stay away from this!

58:57.780 --> 58:59.163
What's happening?

59:00.546 --> 59:01.795
Mom!

59:14.820 --> 59:16.401
Mom!

59:28.929 --> 59:31.169
It's alright. It's-it's OK.

59:33.589 --> 59:34.624
Jillian!

59:42.792 --> 59:43.962
Alright?

59:50.674 --> 59:54.475
- Mom!
- Oh, God! Make them stop!

01:00:04.272 --> 01:00:05.424
Please!

01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:13.321
Riley!

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.398
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee,

01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:30.188
Blessed art Thou amongst women,

01:00:30.198 --> 01:00:32.793
and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

01:00:32.805 --> 01:00:36.248
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,

01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:38.858
Now and at the hour of our death.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.409
Everything will be OK, honey.

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:08.261
I think they've gone.

01:01:10.172 --> 01:01:12.172
Why would they go back?

01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:23.402
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK, honey.

01:01:29.024 --> 01:01:32.142
Get back! Get back! Be careful!

01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:35.847
Go! Ri, come here!

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.795
Hide! Be careful!

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:43.039
Shit! Shit!

01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.182
Y'all in there?

01:01:55.989 --> 01:01:59.218
Sean! Sean!

01:01:59.398 --> 01:02:01.128
- Sean!
- Thank God!

01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:03.768
We're trying to pray.

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:05.540
Shit! Sorry I'm this important.

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.060
Thank you! Thank you for coming back for us.

01:02:08.835 --> 01:02:11.763
I think I got me one of them sons of bitches.

01:02:11.823 --> 01:02:14.199
Listen, I ain't seen them lights in a while.

01:02:14.691 --> 01:02:17.580
- Let's get our asses out in the truck.
- The camera!

01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:20.005
- Come on! Little man, let's get in the truck.
- Come on, Ri.

01:02:20.663 --> 01:02:22.004
- Let's go.
- Come on, Ri.

01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:31.024
Run!

01:02:36.142 --> 01:02:39.074
Riley... Riley, let's go!
Riley let's go! Come on!

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.515
Wait!

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.689
Come on! Over here!

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700
Come here!

01:02:56.451 --> 01:02:57.579
Shit!

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:01.712
Oh, my God! We gotta keep going.

01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:07.457
We'd better go! Watch your step. Come on!

01:03:08.189 --> 01:03:09.404
Let's go!

01:03:18.397 --> 01:03:19.397
Riley!

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.799
Jillian!

01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:49.463
Jillian!

01:04:01.526 --> 01:04:02.526
Jillian!

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.455
Jillian, please!

01:04:13.911 --> 01:04:15.589
Jillian, where'd you go?

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:40.392
Jillian!

01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:43.610
Where are you?

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:14.113
Jillian, please!

01:05:23.769 --> 01:05:26.581
Where are... my family...

01:05:26.647 --> 01:05:30.295
gone... help us!

01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:39.192
I'm scared!

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:13.511
- Jillian!
- Shit! Fuck!

01:06:18.486 --> 01:06:20.092
Be quiet!

01:06:44.187 --> 01:06:46.187
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:49.638
It's okay. He's gone.

01:07:20.679 --> 01:07:22.989
Come on. Get down! Get down!

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.019
Turn the camera off.

01:07:26.361 --> 01:07:28.105
- Turn it off!
 - OK, OK!

01:07:37.562 --> 01:07:39.686
Keep up, Riley, come on.

01:07:49.343 --> 01:07:50.842
Gonna get cold.

01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:08.551
Look!

01:08:09.772 --> 01:08:11.619
There's a town down there.

01:08:29.621 --> 01:08:31.151
Almost there.

01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:37.118
Let's keep moving.

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.890
Come on. Keep up!

01:08:51.839 --> 01:08:53.279
Are we lost?

01:08:57.312 --> 01:09:00.478
We just keep moving down the hill
and we're gonna reach a road.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:06.050
A road that... leads to the town that we saw.

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:13.689
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:19.661
- We're almost there.

01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:23.706
- We just have to keep moving.
- OK.

01:09:41.785 --> 01:09:44.118
Look! Riley, the road!

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.374
We made it!

01:10:18.801 --> 01:10:20.939
Ri, come on! Come on!

01:10:31.241 --> 01:10:32.687
Thank God!

01:10:33.599 --> 01:10:34.904
Thank God!

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.970
You kids alright?

01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:38.978
We need help.

01:10:40.526 --> 01:10:43.676
OK, Jillian. We're-we're safe, now.

01:10:45.362 --> 01:10:48.472
We're OK. We're gonna be OK, Jillian.

01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:51.741
We're gonna be OK.

01:11:00.134 --> 01:11:03.038
128 communications. 128 communications.

01:11:03.656 --> 01:11:05.135
<i>Go on, 128.</i>

01:11:05.176 --> 01:11:08.022
I've got two lost juveniles,
requesting EMT backup.

01:11:08.604 --> 01:11:11.048
We're 500 yards north of Brown Mountain tunnel.

01:11:14.649 --> 01:11:17.595
<i>10-4, 128. EMT backup enroute...</i>

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:19.941
Call for...

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.807
For the past 20 years, I
have been enthusiastically

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:42.981
researching the mystery of
the Brown Mountain lights.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.947
No one knows what they are!

01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:49.764
There are all kinds of theories
of the origin of the lights

01:17:50.614 --> 01:17:55.918
from swamp gas to various theories of...

01:17:56.667 --> 01:17:58.875
radon gas glowing.

01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:03.718
There are people that suggested marsh gases.

01:18:04.057 --> 01:18:07.029
There's no marsh in the area where they were.

01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:11.454
It was just so very clear,
and just so very apparent.

01:18:11.525 --> 01:18:13.798
I mean, it wasn't like: "Can you see that?
Can you see that?"

01:18:13.832 --> 01:18:17.496
I mean, everybody there could
see clearly what it was.

01:18:17.754 --> 01:18:19.283
The people have,

01:18:19.297 --> 01:18:22.286
and I don't know whether it's
imagination or not, said:

01:18:22.477 --> 01:18:25.652
The lights seem to be elusive.

01:18:26.127 --> 01:18:29.987
And what we realized is that when a
legitimate Brown Mountain light appeared

01:18:30.784 --> 01:18:33.482
there was electromagnetic interference.

01:18:33.638 --> 01:18:37.522
And this is not something that's
caused by flashlights, or dirt bikes,

01:18:37.543 --> 01:18:40.098
or four wheelers, or-or lanterns, or... whatever.

01:18:40.268 --> 01:18:45.099
Well, globs of glowing gas appear
randomly in different locations,

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:49.485
last for... seconds, to tens of seconds,

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:51.411
and then dissipate.

01:18:51.842 --> 01:18:53.900
These have been reported for centuries.

01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:57.473
By using equipment that can pickup
that level of interference,

01:18:57.506 --> 01:18:59.737
we were able to start documenting

01:18:59.771 --> 01:19:02.090
where the serious lights were coming from.

01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:06.556
Now, the question becomes: Are these
lights producing the interference?

01:19:06.606 --> 01:19:08.459
Well, we think that they probably are.

01:19:08.484 --> 01:19:14.009
But, that also could be because something bigger
is happening in the environment, at that time.

01:19:14.444 --> 01:19:17.946
There may be some type of an alien element there

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:22.803
because when people see UFOs they talk
about electromagnetic interference.

01:19:22.928 --> 01:19:28.054
And what we saw was basically
a perfectly round orb,

01:19:28.107 --> 01:19:31.641
sphere, whatever... and it was, just,
you know, a light, it was flat.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:37.311
And it was white and it come up,
kinda, from down low, from down in the valley.

01:19:37.385 --> 01:19:40.818
And it kinda came up and then
floated above the ridge.

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:43.688
And then there were two more, but I
can't remember where they came from.

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:47.763
But, they kinda, all three followed
the ridge and then went to the top.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:51.699
And then they kinda danced around to...
Just kinda danced around.

01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:55.087
The lights seem to move about
in a ghost-like manner..

01:19:55.196 --> 01:19:58.101
Danced around. We watched them a long time.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.455
When you start digging into Brown Mountain,

01:20:00.466 --> 01:20:04.899
and you find that, OK, some of these
may just be a natural phenomena,

01:20:04.941 --> 01:20:09.029
but that doesn't explain the people who
claim they've been abducted there.

01:20:09.166 --> 01:20:12.399
And just when I got into the
doorway to my bed-bedroom,

01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:16.558
I had the sensation of being, literally,
sucked up against the ceiling. I mean,

01:20:16.559 --> 01:20:20.101
it wasn't a sensation, I was physically
sucked up against the ceiling.

01:20:20.164 --> 01:20:23.756
and it was the most horrifying thing
I've ever felt in my entire life.

01:20:23.813 --> 01:20:26.706
And it was... real.

01:20:26.797 --> 01:20:31.319
It doesn't explain some of the creature
sightings that have taken place there.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.398
It doesn't explain many of
the conspiracies related

01:20:34.404 --> 01:20:37.164
to military activity and government involvment.

01:20:37.168 --> 01:20:41.191
Someone would come in and they were
gonna find out what they were.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.918
And, uh...

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:48.179
I guess, to justify their
salaries, they had to come up

01:20:48.279 --> 01:20:55.537
with some kind of, uh, theory that would, at
least, partially, justify what they'd done.

01:20:55.939 --> 01:20:58.019
The military activity,

01:20:58.364 --> 01:21:02.964
the root of many of the elaborate
conspiracies of Brown Mountain,

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:06.683
usually have an alien element.

01:21:07.271 --> 01:21:09.891
It's a probability that there is UFOs.

01:21:10.558 --> 01:21:13.373
There's a possibility that I
wouldn't-wouldn't rule out

01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:15.498
much of anything in this day and time.

01:21:16.284 --> 01:21:20.987
We know that the US government
has publicly investigated

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.517
the Brown Mountain lights, at least
three times throughout history.

01:21:24.518 --> 01:21:26.773
And I think science has an obligation,

01:21:27.485 --> 01:21:29.751
in the spirit of Carl Sagan,

01:21:29.831 --> 01:21:33.922
to explain and to investigate
claims of the paranormal.

01:21:34.024 --> 01:21:36.780
So we know that the government, for a long time,

01:21:36.781 --> 01:21:39.336
has been aware of the Brown Mountain lights.

01:21:39.337 --> 01:21:43.751
And it manifests in the way that
we see it, in the shape of orbs.

01:21:44.846 --> 01:21:46.138
But there's something there!

01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:51.634
Brown Mountain is on National
Forest land and if you go to

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.704
some of the overlooks today
you will see that there are

01:21:54.713 --> 01:21:58.028
markers that were put in place
by the federal government.

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:04.336
Brown Mountain lights, to me, may
represent one of the, uh, one of the last

01:22:04.412 --> 01:22:09.753
really interesting frontiers of natural phenomena

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.508
that we don't understand.

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:15.200
The Brown Mountain lights are
an absolutely real phenomenon.

01:22:15.245 --> 01:22:19.374
God only knows what the
Brown Mountain lights are.
