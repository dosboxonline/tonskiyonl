WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:07.485
Oh, Hayley, you know what
I drove by the other day?

00:07.485 --> 00:11.098
That old place we always used to
go to when you were little,

00:11.098 --> 00:13.839
the ice cream shop
with the kinda confusing name?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.450
- Hot Scoops?
- Yeah.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.973
Whaddya you say
we go after this,

00:16.973 --> 00:18.235
for old times' sake?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.498
Ah, wish I could,
Big Mama

00:20.498 --> 00:23.197
but I gotta, uh...
get to work.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.199
I thought Sub Hub
was still closed

00:25.199 --> 00:27.462
because of that
whole horse meat thing.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.378
You know, how they found out it
was actually raccoon meat?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.249
That's right, huh?

00:32.249 --> 00:34.164
I meant, um,
I have a...

00:34.164 --> 00:35.600
ah, let's see...

00:35.600 --> 00:37.428
Groff Progressive Student
Alliance meeting.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.649
On Cesar Chavez Day?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.607
Babe, it's
the Scholastic Book Fair

00:42.607 --> 00:44.174
at the middle school today.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.524
Can I get an advance
on my allowance?

00:46.524 --> 00:48.657
Okay,
but no "Goosebumps."

00:48.657 --> 00:50.006
You'll be awake
all night.

00:52.443 --> 00:55.055
Since when does Hayley
have that kind of loot?

00:55.055 --> 00:59.146
Hm, must be pickin' up a
little extra scratch somehow.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.539
Some, uh, walkin' around
money?

01:01.539 --> 01:03.846
Chuckle cheddar?
Some funky frog-skins?

01:03.846 --> 01:06.588
Play-Doh, lil stash
o' cushion cash.

01:06.588 --> 01:10.026
But where is Hayley picking up
that kind of wallet candy?

01:10.026 --> 01:11.332
Must get it from me.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.160
The ability to make money,
that is,

01:13.160 --> 01:14.596
not the money itself.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.337
As you know,
having come from poverty,

01:16.337 --> 01:18.948
I pride myself on my ability
to provide this family

01:18.948 --> 01:20.167
a high standard
of living.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.298
Steve-o, heads up.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.518
Escargot,
comin' in hot.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.174
Hold up, gettin' a call
from my financial planner.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.697
Scotty Boombotty.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.003
Lemme get somewhere quiet
so you can really scream

01:31.003 --> 01:33.180
those big-ass numbers
at me.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.964
Double digit gains,
you say?

01:34.964 --> 01:38.750
No. I said
"devastating losses."
What?

01:38.750 --> 01:42.885
I told you not to put everything
you had into pornographic pogs.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.366
But the children of the '90s
are all grown up.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.150
Naturally they'll now be
looking for pogs

01:47.150 --> 01:48.891
with more
adult-oriented content.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.198
I remember the words
"sure thing" being said.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.026
By you.
I begged you not to do it.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.419
Okay,
give it to me straight.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.681
How much have I lost?

01:56.681 --> 01:57.813
Stan...

01:57.813 --> 01:59.380
you're gonna lose
the house.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.904
No one must know.

02:01.904 --> 02:05.255
No one must know
that anything is wrong.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.692
Porn pogs must've gone
tits up.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.529
I don't think
he's coming down.

02:18.529 --> 02:22.054
Ah, shizballs,
I gotta scoot.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.796
Here, can you stick this
on Dad's back for me?

02:25.841 --> 02:26.885
For your trouble.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.890
Since when does Hayley
have a bleeper?

02:31.890 --> 02:34.110
Are you trying to say
"beeper"?

02:35.416 --> 02:36.895
Where the hell
is this guy?

02:36.895 --> 02:38.897
I got shit
I gotta do.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.902
♪ Good morning, USA ♪

02:45.730 --> 02:47.819
No one must know.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.300
No one must know that
I've bankrupted the family.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.259
You've bankrupted
the what now?

02:52.259 --> 02:54.086
Probably shoulda done this
in the bathroom.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.958
You heard nothing.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.178
Looks like you're gonna
have to find us

02:58.178 --> 02:59.788
some money fast, Francine.

02:59.788 --> 03:02.269
One more thing
to worry about.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.879
What else
is weighing on you?

03:03.879 --> 03:05.881
Those chimpanzees
in the news,

03:05.881 --> 03:07.622
that've been stepping
on landmines

03:07.622 --> 03:09.363
and losing their limbs?

03:09.363 --> 03:10.451
The chimp-u-tees?

03:10.451 --> 03:12.104
No, it's Hayley.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.324
Klaus,
I think she might be...

03:14.324 --> 03:15.412
dealing.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.631
Pai Gow?

03:16.631 --> 03:17.545
Drugs.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.808
Cool.
But no way.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.463
Hayley's a drug <i>doer,</i>
not a drug <i>dealer.</i>

03:22.463 --> 03:24.813
Oh, yeah?
What about the money,

03:24.813 --> 03:27.859
the secretiveness,
the bleeper...

03:27.859 --> 03:30.601
Sometimes I feel like
I don't know her at all.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.951
It's not like it was
when she was little.

03:32.951 --> 03:36.128
We were two peas in a pod
back then.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.826
Inseparable.

03:37.826 --> 03:41.482
And everywhere we went people
just ate us right up, too.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.267
You've heard the term
"daughter-mama-charm-a-rama"?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.790
No, never.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.271
Well, we were a mega
daughter-mama-charm-a-rama.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.446
Oh, well,
<i>that</i> I've heard.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.448
But that was when
she was a kid.

03:51.448 --> 03:54.756
Now, honestly, God knows
what she could be up to.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.323
Why would you put this
in here?

03:56.323 --> 03:58.673
- Whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.328
Say, what's in
the duffel bag?

04:01.328 --> 04:04.156
Nothing.
Gotta go.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.637
You've been making
that face a lot lately.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.205
- Mm. Like this.
- Mm.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.685
This face. Mm.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
I've ruined us, Roger.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.170
All our money,
our iconic house, gone.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.608
Oh, so you need to pick up
a little extra scratch?

04:20.608 --> 04:21.826
Funky frog-skins?

04:21.826 --> 04:23.828
A little zip-a-
dee-moo-lah?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.918
'Scuse me one sec.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.225
You.
Don't move.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.836
Rugged despair,
salt-and-pepper stubble,

04:31.836 --> 04:33.142
Buzz Lightyear chin...

04:33.142 --> 04:34.883
Why are you wearing
a garbage bag?

04:34.883 --> 04:37.015
I didn't bring a costume with me
so I had to make do

04:37.015 --> 04:39.191
with what I could find
in the bathroom trash can.

04:39.191 --> 04:43.065
Giardia Capitosto, Web Ad
Stock Photo Talent Manager.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.893
The internet needs handsome,

04:44.893 --> 04:46.721
graying,
worried faces like yours.

04:46.721 --> 04:51.116
Erectile dysfunction, reverse
mortgages, 401k mismanagement...

04:51.116 --> 04:53.728
from now on, you could be
the face of them all.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.904
- Is there money in that?
- I think so?

04:55.904 --> 04:58.820
All I know is
you've got <i>it,</i> kid,

04:58.820 --> 05:00.865
and I'm gonna put you
in the pictures.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.650
The little pictures
at the bottom of the screen

05:02.650 --> 05:04.478
on Barstool Sports.

05:18.883 --> 05:21.103
What the hell are you doing
in that bush?

05:21.103 --> 05:25.063
If you must know,
I am <i>trying</i> to sneak into

05:25.063 --> 05:27.762
my ex-boyfriend's
apartment.

05:27.762 --> 05:28.850
Sheila?

05:28.850 --> 05:31.374
Oh, great.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.640
- Aah!
- The jib is up.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.555
I know you've been pushing...

05:40.644 --> 05:42.342
...arthritis medication?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
It's true.
These last few months

05:44.344 --> 05:47.825
I've had a secret side hustle
going as a...

05:47.825 --> 05:49.610
pharmaceutical
representative.

05:49.610 --> 05:53.265
So <i>that's</i>
how you've been making
all that extra money?

05:53.265 --> 05:55.920
Pushing pills
for Big Pharma.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.619
Mom, I am begging you
to keep this secret.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.751
If anyone at the Groff
Progressives found out...

06:00.751 --> 06:03.450
Oh, I'll keep it secret, alright.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.930
Secret like a fox.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.410
- What does that--
- I want in.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.412
I want to push pills
for Big Pharma, too.

06:12.546 --> 06:16.854
Isn't this whole Pharma rep
thing a little shady, though?

06:16.854 --> 06:19.727
Buttering up a bunch
of pervy old doctors to--

06:19.727 --> 06:22.556
<i>Informing</i> a bunch
of pervy old doctors,

06:22.556 --> 06:24.035
about a miracle
arthritis drug

06:24.035 --> 06:26.298
that really will help
so many people.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.779
Hey, if I ever found out
Bendjuvanex wasn't all

06:28.779 --> 06:30.999
it's cracked up to be,
I would quit like that.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.914
But this drug
is the real deal.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.699
Derived from armadillo mucin
humanely harvested

06:35.699 --> 06:38.093
from the best-treated armadillos
in the world.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.703
Plus,
it's been a great way

06:39.703 --> 06:42.010
to make a little
extra scratch, ya know?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.099
That light-green
good-good.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.669
Our scientists start
with the best part

06:48.669 --> 06:50.453
of the armadillo,
the mucin.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.282
And through a proprietary
extraction technology

06:53.282 --> 06:56.633
yield an efficacy rate
of 42% over placebo...

06:56.633 --> 06:57.895
...with a Bayesian
credible interval

06:57.895 --> 07:01.377
of .52 to 1.39.

07:01.377 --> 07:04.424
Alleviation of arthritic
immobility reaches

07:04.424 --> 07:06.251
39% and 47%...

07:06.251 --> 07:07.775
over leading
generic therapies

07:07.775 --> 07:09.298
at initial dosages...

07:09.298 --> 07:12.606
...of 200 and 400 milligrams respectively.

07:12.606 --> 07:15.391
Other compelling numbers
include 27,

07:15.391 --> 07:18.002
7,000, 70,000...

07:19.656 --> 07:21.397
Okay,
thanks so much,

07:21.397 --> 07:23.268
but I think I'll just
stick with generics.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.835
Have a blessed day.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.794
Another bust.

07:26.794 --> 07:30.101
The commissions came so easy
at first, but lately...

07:30.101 --> 07:31.973
Maybe it's time
to just hang it up.

07:31.973 --> 07:35.150
Or maybe we just need to
jazz up our pitch a little--

07:35.150 --> 07:37.979
Mom, I've been doing this
a while now, okay?

07:37.979 --> 07:40.547
This is how we do it.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.422
Alright,
sugar dumpling,

07:46.422 --> 07:48.642
now, y'all don't forget
your chip clips

07:48.642 --> 07:51.166
and your pen-
flashlight-thumbdrive.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.646
Oh, sweet.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.431
And I'll be in touch
with those Shark tickets, too.

07:55.431 --> 07:59.000
Do <i>you</i> come
with the tickets?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.002
Listen, y'all keep
those prescriptions

08:01.002 --> 08:04.222
a-scribble-dibble-doodlin',
and I just might.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.572
Kidding not kidding.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.182
Oh, I will.

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
Also kidding.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.968
I'm not kidding.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.496
There he is.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.020
My worried web ad Adonis.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.457
So rugged.
So handsome.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.850
So haunted.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.329
Brian, your KFC Famous Bowl
is here.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.984
- Don't move a muscle.
- Bubbeleh, amazing news.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.509
We already have another
10 gigs lined up.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.685
Your money troubles
are finito.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.948
Ah. Oh, my God,
thank you, Roger.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.515
Giardia
Something-Something.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.125
This is such a relief.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.388
Now, you've just taken out
a reverse mortgage,

08:39.388 --> 08:41.999
and you're rocked
to your very core

08:41.999 --> 08:45.350
contemplating
the unforeseen risks.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.528
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.270
What the-- You, trash woman,
over here.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.707
- What's up?
- What happened?

08:53.707 --> 08:54.882
He's lost the look.
- The what?

08:54.882 --> 08:56.884
The look. Look.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.842
Just look at him.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.017
Oh, yeah.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.584
God,
he sucks.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.977
Where's the concern?

09:02.977 --> 09:05.675
The stunned, grave,
soul-piercing worry?

09:05.675 --> 09:07.503
It's not there.
He's [bleep] it up.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.071
I got this.
- What's up. Everything good?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.247
Hmm, you know, on the set
of "The Exorcist,"

09:12.247 --> 09:14.510
Billy Friedkin once
slapped an actor

09:14.510 --> 09:17.078
to get the stunned,
haunted look he needed.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.080
Well, that's a really
interesting bit of movie trivia.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.038
Thanks for--
- There it is. Go, go, go.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.608
- Hayley, listen!
- Aah!

09:25.608 --> 09:29.786
Sorry. Look, I know you wanna
stick to facts and figures,

09:29.786 --> 09:31.701
but if we're gonna keep
this gig goin'

09:31.701 --> 09:35.749
and the money a-flowin',
we have to change things up.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.925
Okay, well,
just how, exactly?

09:37.925 --> 09:40.667
By focusing
on the four S's--

09:40.667 --> 09:44.453
sex, sass, and swag.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.760
That's three.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.891
What's the fourth "S"?

09:47.891 --> 09:49.284
It's "us."

09:49.284 --> 09:51.416
The "S" is at the end
of that one.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.593
Us.
You and me.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.465

11:22.551 --> 11:27.295
a live-action TV commercial
for, wait for it, Bendjuvanex.

11:27.295 --> 11:30.428
One last big slap, and
your money troubles are finito.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.605
Whaddya say we go to BJ's
and celebrate with a Pizookie?

11:33.605 --> 11:35.042
One more big slap,

11:35.042 --> 11:37.479
and your troubles
could be just beginning.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.133
Oh, right,
I forgot we were here.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.309
All those slaps have left
your face as fragile

11:41.309 --> 11:45.705
as a gossamer veil of ice
atop a springtime lagoon.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.402
My God, that's...

11:47.402 --> 11:49.360
a beautiful description.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.754
The point is,
even one more slap

11:51.754 --> 11:53.843
to Stan's
bullshit face bones

11:53.843 --> 11:55.062
and he risks...

11:55.062 --> 11:57.891
a full facial
cave-in.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.460
I still wanna get
a Pizookie.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.598
I give you
our new top regional reps,

12:09.598 --> 12:11.731
Hayley and Francine Smith,

12:11.731 --> 12:15.517
who will be receiving
a hefty bonus and the honor

12:15.517 --> 12:20.087
of driving
the Bendjuvanex Pillmobile.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.267
I couldn'a done it
without ya.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.486
So here's to you,
Big Mama.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.620
Nah, nah, nah,
Little Mama. To us.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.101
I couldn't've done it
without you either.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.233
No us?
No magic.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.800
And no magic...

12:37.800 --> 12:39.541
no mona-a-a-y.

12:41.543 --> 12:44.502
Aight, I gotta use
the little reps' room.

12:47.549 --> 12:52.946
Congra-a-a-a-tulations
to the big hero.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.121
You wanna go, brah?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.513
What's your problem, chief?

12:55.513 --> 12:58.603
<i>Our</i> problem
is Bendjuvanex.

12:58.603 --> 13:01.868
I was the lead scientist
who developed it.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.740
And this miracle drug
that I made,

13:04.740 --> 13:06.307
and that
you're selling...

13:06.307 --> 13:08.875
isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.137
Oh, no.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.225
Does it not work?

13:11.225 --> 13:12.966
What?
It works great.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.489
I take it myself.

13:15.403 --> 13:19.363
In fact,
it works too great.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.105
The clinical trials all went
so well at first.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.369
The subjects' arthritis
improved rapidly.

13:25.369 --> 13:29.547
But soon, after ingesting
all that damn mucin,

13:29.547 --> 13:33.160
they must've built up so many
armadillo pheromones that...

13:33.160 --> 13:34.378
they began to attract...

13:36.032 --> 13:37.164
...predators.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.340
First came
the coyotes.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.211
Our headquarters was
right next to a desert.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.431
Then the bears, owls,

13:43.431 --> 13:47.043
red-tailed hawks,
a few Komodo dragons.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.698
94%
of the non-control group

13:49.698 --> 13:53.267
was killed
by armadillo predators.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.138
Well, that was in
a lab setting.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.184
We don't know
it'll translate to--

13:57.184 --> 13:58.402
Yes, we do!

13:58.402 --> 14:00.883
And we covered it up!

14:02.624 --> 14:06.367
God knows what we're
unleashing on the world!

14:06.367 --> 14:08.369
Shame on all of us!

14:08.369 --> 14:12.503
I didn't get to finish
my negroni!

14:12.503 --> 14:13.591
Hey.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.593
Did I miss anything?

14:15.593 --> 14:18.858
Nope. In fact, you're
<i>getting</i> half a negroni.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.037
Make sure you got
the Bendjuvanex barbecue set.

14:24.037 --> 14:27.040
The doc we're seeing here
is a total swag hag.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.088
Hey, you can't
park that there!

14:32.088 --> 14:35.396
It's okay!
We're top regional reps!

14:35.396 --> 14:37.528
His office is
just through the E.R.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.884
Another coyote bite here.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.322
Komodo dragon just tore through
the Ruby Tuesday's on Sixth.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.237
Incoming!
- Coyotes?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.935
Komodo--
What the hell is going on?

14:52.935 --> 14:54.763
I have no idea.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.113
Oh, don't you?

14:57.113 --> 15:00.116
This is exactly what I warned
you would happen.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.075
Mom, what's this guy
talking about?

15:02.075 --> 15:04.816
I'm talking about Bendjuvanex.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.862
They knew
this would happen.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.343
They knew
and they covered it up.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.084
And so did she.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.434
- Wha-- I--
- Bear!

15:15.697 --> 15:17.829
Oh, God,
what have we done?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.570
So this <i>is</i> true?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.442
And you...
knew?

15:21.442 --> 15:23.661
I...didn't know
for sure that--

15:23.661 --> 15:25.620
And you let me go out there
with you,

15:25.620 --> 15:27.970
pushing this death drug
onto people?

15:27.970 --> 15:31.104
- I just-- I needed--
- You needed what?

15:31.104 --> 15:32.757
A little extra scratch?

15:32.757 --> 15:33.976
How could you?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.936
I-- I never want
to speak to you again.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.808
Tom Bagetti:
Can you do me a solid?

15:39.808 --> 15:43.159
Check out my toe tag.
Tell me what it says?

15:43.159 --> 15:45.161
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.294
"Goner."

15:47.294 --> 15:49.818
Are you sure you want me
to slap you, Stan?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.255
If you care to remember,
your face might cave in.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.778
I'm afraid
we have no choice.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.476
It's a risk
I'll just have to take.

15:55.476 --> 15:58.348
I needs dem clams.

15:58.348 --> 16:03.179
Whoa. Now, that's what I call
grave, soul-piercing worry.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.615
Stan.
Lock that in.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.400
You got back the look.
It's a miracle.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.924
What the-- What--
What the hell is this?

16:08.924 --> 16:10.926

a few weeks ago?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.581
Yeah, my career
has advanced, too.

16:13.581 --> 16:14.843
I'm a director now.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.976
But this is
an "after" commercial.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.327
<i>After</i> the drug has given him
a new lease on life.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.938

contentment, joy.

Quick, Stan, smile.

20:44.591 --> 20:49.160
Now, that's what I call
a little extra <i>scratch.</i>

20:50.336 --> 20:51.511
Let's get outta here.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.513
This is actually
pretty gruesome.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.344
Bye. Have a great time.
