25:21.590 --> 25:22.700
But I'll need proof.

25:22.900 --> 25:27.570
[Landon sighs]
[pensive music]

25:27.770 --> 25:29.660
[engine rumbling]

25:29.860 --> 25:32.130
[soft music]

25:43.230 --> 25:46.540
[keyboard keys clacking]

25:55.030 --> 25:57.940
[phone vibrating]

26:09.040 --> 26:10.180
[kids chattering]
[upbeat music]

26:10.380 --> 26:15.350
[indistinct singing]
[door slams]

26:36.810 --> 26:40.590
- You know what would be
really sexy is if we...

26:44.550 --> 26:48.210
Just so I can watch it
later and think of you.

26:50.040 --> 26:50.950
Um...

26:52.300 --> 26:53.920
- We don't have to,
if you don't want to.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.360
No, no, it's fine.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.960
I've just never...

26:59.440 --> 27:01.580
It would just be for you, right?

27:01.780 --> 27:02.710
Yeah.

27:02.910 --> 27:03.660
Of course.

27:05.010 --> 27:06.190
Okay.

27:06.390 --> 27:11.230
[music continues]
[kids chattering]

27:16.330 --> 27:20.110
[Nathalie exhales nervously]

27:24.030 --> 27:25.770
Do you have a um, um...

27:28.900 --> 27:32.250
[condom rapper rustling]

27:40.440 --> 27:42.450
I really like you,
you know, Hardin?

27:42.650 --> 27:43.400
Mm hm.

27:45.880 --> 27:50.710
[Nathalie panting]
[soft music]

28:13.770 --> 28:16.340
[engine rumbling]

28:19.950 --> 28:20.780
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.970
[Nathalie speaking
in Portuguese]

28:25.170 --> 28:26.230
[waiter speaking in Portuguese]

28:26.430 --> 28:27.230
[Nathalie speaking
in Portuguese]

28:27.430 --> 28:29.800
[waiter speaking in Portuguese]

28:30.000 --> 28:32.490
I thought you were
making amends?

28:33.710 --> 28:34.530
Yeah.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.200
Guess that depends.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.320
Depends on what?

28:39.320 --> 28:40.160
You.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.110
[gentle music]

28:45.110 --> 28:48.290
So, where are you living now?

28:48.850 --> 28:50.560
Camden.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.780
- Yeah, I'm back in Camden.
- Oh, I heard that you moved.

28:52.980 --> 28:55.000
Yeah, I did.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.900
I kinda did the whole
tour of the U.S.

28:59.340 --> 29:00.340
But I'm back now.

29:03.780 --> 29:07.000
- So, which one do
you like the best?

29:09.130 --> 29:10.060
It's gotta be this one.

29:10.260 --> 29:11.660
Oh, come on.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.190
Here, try this.

29:15.390 --> 29:17.240
It's a sour cherry liquor.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.980
It's Portuguese tradition.

29:19.180 --> 29:19.930
Go on.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.070
Oh, okay [laughs].

29:26.270 --> 29:26.990
Oh, you...

29:27.190 --> 29:27.940
Sorry [chuckles], my bad.

29:28.140 --> 29:28.990
It's fine.

29:29.190 --> 29:30.030
No, it's nice.

29:30.230 --> 29:30.980
I like it.

29:32.370 --> 29:33.340
I still prefer the whiskey.

29:33.540 --> 29:34.650
[Nathalie] No.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.780
- I'm a creature
of habit, aren't I?

29:36.980 --> 29:37.770
Hm.

29:39.470 --> 29:41.990
So, how did you end up here?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.840
- I don't know if
I'll end up here.

29:51.040 --> 29:55.440
Just seemed like a good
place to start over.

29:57.790 --> 29:59.540
- You were on your
way to uni though, no?

29:59.740 --> 30:04.200
- No, yeah, I was, but
I lost my scholarship

30:04.400 --> 30:05.680
with everything going on,

30:05.880 --> 30:08.110
and I didn't have time to
apply for a student loan.

30:08.310 --> 30:12.410
And it turns out my support
system was conditional.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.730
So, I picked a
place that was sunny

30:18.930 --> 30:23.560
and affordable where
no one knew me,

30:24.990 --> 30:25.950
and now here I am.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.820
But this part I
was not expecting.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.530
I did not think I
would see you again,

30:32.730 --> 30:35.610
much less have a
catch up over drinks.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.480
Sorry.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.270
I'm sorry.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.440
Okay.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.890
- I don't really know
what else to say.

30:47.090 --> 30:48.190
I'm just...

30:52.060 --> 30:55.810
I know I fucked up and you
had to pay the consequences,

30:56.010 --> 30:57.850
which, I mean,

30:59.110 --> 31:00.990
I really fucking wish I could
just go back and then I-

31:01.190 --> 31:02.200
And what?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.120
I wouldn't...

31:07.300 --> 31:10.000
[gentle music]

31:10.200 --> 31:12.920
[Nathalie sighs]

31:13.120 --> 31:13.870
I'm trying.

31:14.870 --> 31:15.690
I am.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.830
I'm trying to be
a better person.

31:22.700 --> 31:23.530
I see.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.460
Right, do you want some food
to soak up all this booze?

31:30.660 --> 31:31.420
[Hardin chuckles]

31:31.610 --> 31:32.370
Yeah?
[Hardin's throat clears]

31:32.570 --> 31:33.360
Yeah.

31:37.150 --> 31:38.810
Mm, that is delicious.

31:39.010 --> 31:40.420
I can't believe I haven't
heard these before.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.170
- [Nathalie] No, this is
like the best place ever.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.730
And these?

31:43.930 --> 31:45.900
I forgot what these were
called, but these are so good.

31:46.770 --> 31:48.650
That is my fork.

31:48.850 --> 31:51.520
[Hardin laughs]
[Nathalie chuckles]

31:51.720 --> 31:52.740
[Nathalie speaking
in Portuguese]

31:52.940 --> 31:54.090
What?

31:54.290 --> 31:56.830
I'm not gonna remember that.
[Nathalie laughs]

31:57.030 --> 31:59.010
Salt cod fritters.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.140
They're unreal.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.660
I mean, the whole
meal was amazing.

32:01.860 --> 32:03.880
- Right?
I love the food here.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.360
I mean, everything here really.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.840
It's great.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.190
[chuckles] You see?

32:08.390 --> 32:10.190
You are in better
spirits already.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.460
Mm mm, I'll get this.

32:12.660 --> 32:13.940
- Really, are you sure?
- Definitely.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.070
[Nathalie] Thank you.

32:15.270 --> 32:16.370
[Hardin] Of course.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.290
- Oh, I didn't realize
how long we'd been here.

32:18.490 --> 32:19.320
I have to go.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.330
No worries.

32:23.330 --> 32:24.860
Hey, night [laughs].

32:25.060 --> 32:25.940
All right.

32:27.590 --> 32:28.510
Goodnight.

32:30.770 --> 32:32.340
You know, I read your book.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.560
So, what happened with Tessa?

32:37.730 --> 32:40.560
[Hardin sighs]

32:42.350 --> 32:45.440
I fucked that up too, again.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.540
I see.

32:49.740 --> 32:54.100
[soft melancholy music]
[patrons chattering]

32:58.450 --> 33:03.110
[trams rumbling]
[music continues]

33:07.240 --> 33:09.940
[alcohol sloshing]

33:20.120 --> 33:21.170
Hardin?

33:22.210 --> 33:24.880
Hardin, wake up!

33:25.080 --> 33:26.400
Wake up!

33:26.600 --> 33:27.790
What have you done?

33:27.990 --> 33:28.970
What do you mean?

33:29.170 --> 33:30.270
- With the video,
the video of us!

33:30.470 --> 33:31.840
You've sent it around.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.800
Why would you do this?
Why would you do this to me?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.060
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No. You've sent it!

33:36.260 --> 33:37.720
It's been posted.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.330
Everyone's seen it.

33:39.530 --> 33:41.760
Do you know what
this will do to me?

33:41.960 --> 33:44.640
- Fuck.
- You're a fucking liar.

33:44.830 --> 33:45.770
- You're a disgusting liar.
- Nathalie!

33:45.970 --> 33:46.990
Nat!

33:47.190 --> 33:47.900
[Nathalie] Disgusting.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.550
[door slams]

33:50.750 --> 33:51.820
Fuck!

33:52.020 --> 33:53.170
Fuck!

33:53.370 --> 33:54.200
James!

33:55.640 --> 33:57.340
- [laughs] Fuck me, man.
- Hey!

33:57.540 --> 33:59.300
- Hey, you weren't kidding
about Nathalie, bro.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.090
Who did you send it to?

34:01.290 --> 34:03.000
A couple guys.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.960
You know, I might send
it around a little bit.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.350
Why are you being
weird about it?

34:06.550 --> 34:08.570
Why am I being weird?

34:08.770 --> 34:10.970
You sent around a
private fucking video.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.270
What the fuck is wrong with you?

34:12.470 --> 34:13.620
Wrong with me [laughs]?

34:13.820 --> 34:15.320
You're the one who
took the bet, bro.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.620
You fucking taped it.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.060
- This is on you,
Hardin, not me.

34:19.260 --> 34:21.320
[dramatic music]
[fist thuds]

34:21.520 --> 34:26.230
[Hardin gasping]
[melancholy music]

34:27.100 --> 34:28.160
Fuck.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.670
[melancholy music continues]

35:02.140 --> 35:04.580
[phone vibrating]

35:10.450 --> 35:12.980
[upbeat music]

35:21.160 --> 35:23.770
[waves splashing]

35:29.210 --> 35:30.260
Give me some of that wine.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.830
- That wine.
- Just sayin',

35:33.030 --> 35:34.440
I'm gonna be carrying
both of you home.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.170
Babe alert, 10 o'clock.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.530
I didn't think you'd make it.

35:39.730 --> 35:40.930
That makes two of us.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.100
And he comes bearing gifts.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.630
To whom do we owe this pleasure?

35:45.830 --> 35:48.320
Mads, Freya, this is Hardin.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.110
Hardin, Maddy, Freya.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.460
You can call me Madeline.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.200
Nice to meet you, Madeline.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.420
- No one ever calls
you Madeline, you ham.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.070
- My ex did once,
the French one.

35:59.270 --> 35:59.940
[Freya scoffs]

36:00.140 --> 36:03.500
"Madeline," yum [squeals]!

36:04.980 --> 36:07.430
- She is always like
this, by the way,

36:07.630 --> 36:08.900
with or without alcohol.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.990
So, how do you two?

36:14.250 --> 36:18.520
Hardin was my first crush.

36:19.870 --> 36:20.750
[Maddy] Hey.

36:20.950 --> 36:21.780
Was I?

36:23.220 --> 36:24.060
Hm.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.140
Just a crush, or?

36:26.340 --> 36:27.790
Okay. Got it.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.980
- None of you guys are
actually from here I take it?

36:31.170 --> 36:32.150
Oh no, no one's from here.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.760
We're as close to locals
as you can get.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.590
All orphans.

36:35.790 --> 36:36.940
This is a good place to come

36:37.140 --> 36:38.030
when you're running
from yourself.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.420
- Well, that's bleak.
- Right?

36:39.620 --> 36:41.590
[Freya chuckles]
[Maddy chuckles]

36:41.790 --> 36:43.510
- [Maddy] Oh God, look
what the tide dragged in.

36:43.710 --> 36:46.470
- Why does it look like a
Dolce & Gabbana plane ad?

36:46.670 --> 36:48.300
- I'll have a little
scratch and sniff.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.340
- Oh, you are officially out.
- What?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.290
Hey there.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.310
- Oh!
- Oh, God no.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.600
You're gettin' me all wet.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.400
Who's this?

37:01.600 --> 37:02.700
Hardin.

37:02.900 --> 37:06.360
Me and Nat, we grew up together.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.440
Hm.

37:09.740 --> 37:11.010
- [Freya] Grow up,
shake his hand.

37:15.270 --> 37:17.010
Well, this is Sebastian.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.500
Sebastian, Hardin's
in town from London.

37:20.700 --> 37:21.800
He's a famous author.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.810
- Wait, what?
- I wouldn't say famous.

37:25.010 --> 37:25.810
I'm just an author...

37:26.010 --> 37:26.730
No?

37:26.930 --> 37:28.250
Would you say bestselling?

37:28.450 --> 37:29.770
What's one of your books?

37:29.970 --> 37:31.560
- There is only
one, but honestly-

37:31.760 --> 37:32.820
It's called "After."

37:33.020 --> 37:34.210
No way I've heard of that.

37:34.410 --> 37:35.210
I've read that.

37:35.410 --> 37:36.170
[Nathalie] No, you haven't.

37:36.370 --> 37:37.430
I loved it.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.780
Well, as much as you
can love something

37:38.980 --> 37:41.050
that makes you ugly
cry every other page.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.610
- [Maddy] I heard
they're making a movie?

37:42.810 --> 37:43.740
Oh, Harry Style should play you.

37:43.940 --> 37:45.010
Thank you.

37:45.210 --> 37:47.260
- [Maddy] So, you're
working on anything now?

37:48.350 --> 37:49.400
I'm trying, yeah.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.740
What is it they say?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.150
Everyone has one book in them,

37:54.350 --> 37:56.500
only the talented have a second.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.150
Huh, wow.

37:58.350 --> 37:59.670
Spoken like a true writer.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.460
Tell me, where can I
find your body of work?

38:01.660 --> 38:03.590
[girls chuckling]

38:03.790 --> 38:05.850
- The boy can keep up.
- Mm hm.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.590
- You ever been
cliff diving, man?

38:07.790 --> 38:08.940
No, I'm putting my foot down.

yourself at this point.

She says so.

55:45.330 --> 55:46.510
So, you've talked to her?

55:49.250 --> 55:50.690

last message saying,

55:53.990 --> 55:56.130

on, 'cause I have."

I'm being irrational when...

55:59.650 --> 56:03.280

go but I genuinely,

56:03.480 --> 56:05.670
I cannot comprehend the
thought of giving up on us.

56:11.410 --> 56:13.550
Maybe you can hold a space
for her in your heart

56:13.750 --> 56:15.190
like I hold a
space for your mom.

56:16.760 --> 56:18.200
Always.

56:18.400 --> 56:19.680
It doesn't mean
that you can't go on

56:19.880 --> 56:21.370

56:22.640 --> 56:23.810
and live a full life.

56:26.810 --> 56:28.080

56:28.280 --> 56:32.600
- Well, take it from
someone who does.

56:37.480 --> 56:42.390
It's easy to believe that our
ability to love is finite,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.010
especially when your
heart is broken.

56:47.440 --> 56:51.580
But believe it or not,
slowly you will heal.

56:53.880 --> 56:58.240
And your capacity for love
will grow exponentially.

56:58.440 --> 57:00.990
You'll be able to keep a
space for Tessa in your heart,

57:01.190 --> 57:03.820
for your family, for
your future children,

57:04.020 --> 57:05.590
for anybody who
comes into your life.

57:06.810 --> 57:08.040
And you never know,

57:08.240 --> 57:11.030
maybe you and Tessa are
meant to be together.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.390
And if that is the case,

57:13.590 --> 57:15.130
then you will find your
way back to each other,

57:15.330 --> 57:17.390
but it's not gonna
happen like this is it?

57:17.590 --> 57:18.390
Look at you.

57:19.820 --> 57:21.690
You go on drinking and
messing up the way you are.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.260
You're right.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.930
You are, of course you're right.

57:32.130 --> 57:35.190
You know, my life was
finally getting somewhere.

57:35.390 --> 57:37.890
You know, with the book I
actually finally did something,

57:38.090 --> 57:39.230
something I was proud of.

57:41.150 --> 57:42.770
And then, yeah, I mean,

57:42.970 --> 57:45.070
I guess it fucked up and
everything blew up in my face.

57:45.270 --> 57:46.600
And now the bar's
so fucking high,

57:46.800 --> 57:48.070
I'll never get back there again.

57:49.070 --> 57:50.460
I'm so scared of failing,

57:52.380 --> 57:54.470
so I just end up ruining
everything instead.

57:59.860 --> 58:00.830
It's pathetic.

58:01.030 --> 58:01.870
- You're right.
- Listen to me.

58:02.070 --> 58:02.870
It's fucking pathetic,

58:03.070 --> 58:04.530
- isn't it?
- Listen.

58:04.730 --> 58:09.100
You need to change the metrics
by which you define success.

58:09.300 --> 58:13.450
You can start by
writing one page a day.

58:13.650 --> 58:16.110
Just that, and that'll
be your success.

58:16.300 --> 58:17.980
And if your second book
comes out and it flunks,

58:18.180 --> 58:20.940
but you've been
real and authentic,

58:21.140 --> 58:22.100
then that is a success.

58:24.580 --> 58:28.600
Whether you end up with a
woman you have loved or not,

58:28.800 --> 58:31.560
you have loved with
every cell in your being,

58:31.760 --> 58:34.510
and that in and of itself
is a spectacular success.

58:40.600 --> 58:41.430
Wow.

58:43.950 --> 58:45.650
You're not bad at
this Dad stuff.

58:47.950 --> 58:50.910

the pinnacle of success.

58:53.700 --> 58:54.700

I rang the doorbell

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.840
and you weren't on WhatsApp

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.370
and I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:12.720

- Yes.

little care package.

I didn't think that you'd
be in a state to go out, so.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.630
This is ridiculously generous.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.820
I should probably tell you
that I've stopped drinking.

- Yeah [chuckles].

there was something

spending this time together,

that all means something.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.370
You didn't force me
to do anything.

01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.670
No, but I lied to you, Nat.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.930

but I do see it now.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.240
