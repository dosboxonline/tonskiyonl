with all your demands?

14:29.791 --> 14:31.249
That's-- That's not what I...

14:31.250 --> 14:36.457
Oh, the lad may be onto something.
Every action sparks a reaction.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.208
Oh, ball sockets.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.625
Do you think this could actually
be a result of overuse of Hextech?

14:42.208 --> 14:47.249
I've seen miracles spring
from the hands of mages many times,

14:47.250 --> 14:49.707
but so often,

14:49.708 --> 14:51.665
they turned to horrors.

14:51.666 --> 14:55.291
I'd always presumed
it was due to mankind's...

14:55.833 --> 14:58.375
turbulent relationship with power.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.916
But perhaps it is a property
of the Arcane itself.

15:05.708 --> 15:09.499
We tested our Hextech under
every conceivable condition for years.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.374
If there's some reaction taking place,

15:11.375 --> 15:14.040
how come we've never seen
any sign of it until now?

15:14.041 --> 15:19.291
And why would it appear
on a tree, deep underground?

15:21.625 --> 15:22.625
Hmm.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.666
[dramatic music playing]

15:50.958 --> 15:51.958
[door opens]

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
[footsteps approaching]

15:58.541 --> 15:59.915
[Elora] Your source panned out.

15:59.916 --> 16:04.125
I've confirmed Salo met privately
with members of several houses today.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.250
I should have been first
to bring this to you.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.624
I promise I wouldn't have missed it.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.040
It's just such a bold move.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.874
And at this moment, it's...

16:13.875 --> 16:15.041
[Mel] Foolish.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.666
Of course, your mother
is anything but a fool.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.208
There must be an angle I'm missing.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.625
Hmm.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.790
Did you look into the other matter?

16:25.791 --> 16:29.791
There's a rat's nest of misinformation
surrounding your brother's passing.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.958
Whomever he crossed knows
how to cover their tracks.

16:33.500 --> 16:37.833
Moreover, they've managed to strip
your mother of most of her holdings.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.541
She's desperate.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.500
Which makes her all the more dangerous.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.375
What are we going to do?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.999
Summon the apothecary.
I'll want his opinion of this.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.583
And check in on Amara.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.250
[Ekko] This is still part of the Hexgates?

17:07.291 --> 17:10.291
We must be at least 200 feet
below the surface.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.957
[Jayce] The entire structure is a channel,

17:12.958 --> 17:15.750
focusing the Hextech energy
into a precise beam.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.875
[suspenseful music playing]

17:33.416 --> 17:34.708
[distorted laughter]

17:39.458 --> 17:40.416
Cait.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.791
If you see an opening...

17:45.041 --> 17:46.083
take the shot.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.833
[Caitlyn] Vi.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.124
[Jayce] <i>How do you
know so much about its design?</i>

18:06.125 --> 18:08.707
[Ekko] <i>Read what I could,
deduced what I couldn't.</i>

18:08.708 --> 18:11.957
<i>Plus, I didn't think the Topside
would trust anything that important</i>

18:11.958 --> 18:13.291
<i>below the surface.</i>

18:18.125 --> 18:19.875
[dramatic music playing]

18:24.958 --> 18:27.874
I thought the gemstone mesh
was installed aboveground.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.207
[Jayce] The mesh is aboveground,

18:29.208 --> 18:31.915
but we weren't sure what would happen
if the gate overloaded,

18:31.916 --> 18:33.999
so we installed a failsafe at the base.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.207
So instead of it exploding
in your neighborhood,

18:37.208 --> 18:38.415
it would blow up in ours.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.415
We're miles from the main fissures.

18:40.416 --> 18:43.207
These are the same utility ducts
that carry our water

18:43.208 --> 18:45.124
and facilitate our ventilation.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.790
That would explain it affecting the tree.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.707
Inconceivable.

18:49.708 --> 18:53.250
[Ekko] You know, you say we should
feel like we're all one people.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.500
But whenever it rains,
we're the ones that get wet...

18:58.041 --> 18:59.166
What the...?

19:04.125 --> 19:05.124
Jinx!

19:05.125 --> 19:06.624

19:06.625 --> 19:08.208

19:11.041 --> 19:13.790
Guess there really isn't
a crack in the earth

19:13.791 --> 19:15.999
where you won't find me.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.540
What is this place?

19:17.541 --> 19:20.957
[Jinx] Don't you remember
the old Janna bedtime stories

19:20.958 --> 19:22.833
Vander used to tell us?

19:23.375 --> 19:25.749
[in melodramatic voice]
Miners trapped underground.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.665

But then some wispy wind woman
wafts to their rescue.

19:34.875 --> 19:38.458

To keep people safe.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.250

19:44.791 --> 19:48.333
Never thought my sister
would turn bluebelly.

19:48.916 --> 19:51.165
Never thought mine would orphan kids.

19:51.166 --> 19:55.540
[Jinx] Ha! Why not?
Done it to myself enough.

19:55.541 --> 19:57.874
But plastering my face all over

19:57.875 --> 20:01.250

20:05.125 --> 20:08.207

20:08.208 --> 20:11.540
I'm done blaming myself for your mistakes.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.957
Done pretending you're my sister.
You're not.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.582
You killed her.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.416
I'm not gonna let you
stain her memory anymore.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.833
[Jinx] Then stop me.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.333
'Cause no matter what I do,

20:27.916 --> 20:29.708
I just can't seem to die.
