WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
[wind blowing]

00:15.265 --> 00:17.350
[gentle music plays]

00:17.434 --> 00:18.852
[Arnold] My visions

00:19.728 --> 00:21.479
were so clear,

00:22.355 --> 00:23.940
and they were so targeted.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.444
It was like the rifle approach.

00:28.403 --> 00:32.157
The target is in front,
and I was aiming for the bull's-eye.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.079
And you just have to
really be careful of that,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.081
because you can get so obsessed…

00:42.709 --> 00:46.421
you start losing sight
of everything else around it.

00:48.506 --> 00:52.260
[reporter] More misery for Californians
hit hard by the power crisis there.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.262
[reporter 2] The stock market suffered
a fall.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.347
[reporter 3] Everything
that could possibly go wrong

00:56.431 --> 00:58.475
has come together here all at once.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.810
[reporter 4] Scary economic times, indeed.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.063
[Arnold] When I saw
the mess in California,

01:03.146 --> 01:05.148
more and more I saw myself

01:05.231 --> 01:06.900
being in Sacramento

01:06.983 --> 01:08.401
and being the governor,

01:09.027 --> 01:10.612
with no idea how.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.865
People said to me, "That's crazy."

01:13.948 --> 01:16.326
"People usually run for city council,

01:16.409 --> 01:17.410
then mayor."

01:17.494 --> 01:18.870
"You work your way up."

01:19.704 --> 01:22.415
I said, "Well, no. Ronald Reagan did it."

01:22.499 --> 01:25.126
So I was not concerned about it at all.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.046
In 2002,

01:28.129 --> 01:30.298
I then went to Andy Vanja,

01:30.381 --> 01:32.008
the owner of Carolco.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.511
I said, "What do you think
about me running for governor?"

01:34.594 --> 01:37.764
"You're rich. You know rich people
and studio executives."

01:37.847 --> 01:40.683
"And I need you
to help me with raising money."

01:40.767 --> 01:43.561
And he said to me,
"You're out of your fucking mind."

01:44.854 --> 01:47.524
I said, "What kind of…
What reaction is that?"

01:47.607 --> 01:50.652
He says, "Remember we talked
about doing Terminator 3?"

01:50.735 --> 01:52.403
"Well, I sold the movie."

01:52.487 --> 01:54.823
"We're gonna start shooting
beginning of next year."

01:54.906 --> 01:57.325
"I would have to sue you
because they will sue me."

01:57.408 --> 02:00.245
"So I wouldn't go there.
Do it some other time."

02:01.538 --> 02:04.749
So then I instead did Proposition 49,

02:04.833 --> 02:08.169
which was continuing on my work
with after-school programs.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.631
The After School Education and Safety Act.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.426
You always make it a spicy name
so that everyone gets it.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.430
I think the time for lip service is over.
The time for action is here.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.307
I am the action hero in the movies,

02:21.391 --> 02:23.935
and I want to create action
for the children.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.646
That was a way to taste
a little of what it's like

02:26.729 --> 02:29.149
to campaign out there
for your own project.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.652
-[DJ] Arnold Schwarzenegger is here.
-Tom, it's really great to be here.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.113
Let's say "Hasta la vista, baby,"
to the problem.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.241
-What are we voting on Proposition 49?
-[crowd] Yes!

02:38.324 --> 02:39.325
I'll be back.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.452
I'll be back. I'll be back.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.829
-Thank you very much.
-[cheering]

02:42.912 --> 02:43.872
Thank you.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.709
[reporter] After Arnold Schwarzenegger
worked his Hollywood magic

02:47.792 --> 02:50.295
and came up big with Proposition 49…

02:51.546 --> 02:53.923
[Arnold] So now, in 2003,

02:54.007 --> 02:55.967
the timing was perfect

02:56.050 --> 02:58.845
that we had
a recall election in California,

02:58.928 --> 03:01.347
and they were looking for another leader.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.809
It would be hard for me
to win a Republican primary,

03:04.893 --> 03:06.519
but there is no primary.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
There's not a lead-up time of two years

03:08.813 --> 03:10.481
where people can investigate

03:10.565 --> 03:12.817
and look at your background
and dig everything up.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.195
Two-months campaign. It's like in Europe.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.905
Two months. Bang.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.990
[adventurous music plays]

03:30.793 --> 03:31.961
[man] The life you know,

03:33.630 --> 03:35.840
all the stuff you take for granted,

03:37.842 --> 03:38.927
it's not gonna last.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.143
[Arnold] I was in the middle of
promoting Terminator 3.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.479
I was going all over the world.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.897
So I went to Iraq.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.857
I play the Terminator,

03:52.941 --> 03:55.860
but you guys are the true terminators.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.695
[cheering]

03:57.779 --> 04:00.615
[Arnold] I went to Japan.
I went to Asian countries.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.992
Middle East, Europe.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.080
When the recall was announced,
I was in Mexico.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.623
[suspenseful music plays]

04:09.540 --> 04:12.502
[reporter] It's one
of those only-in-California stories.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.755
The state's unpopular governor,
Gray Davis,

04:15.838 --> 04:19.801
beset by an ailing economy
and a $38 million budget deficit,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.053
faces possible recall.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.930
Have you signed
to recall the governor yet?

04:24.639 --> 04:28.434
[reporter 2] What started as a small
movement to recall Governor Gray Davis

04:28.518 --> 04:32.605
has mushroomed into a powerful,
multi-million dollar campaign.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.859
[reporter 3] On October 7th,
voters will decide if Davis should go

04:36.943 --> 04:38.611
and who should replace him.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.238
[reporter 2] And the big question,

04:40.321 --> 04:42.657
is the Terminator waiting in the wings?

04:46.619 --> 04:50.832
[Arnold] Up to that point,
Maria hated the idea of me running,

04:51.916 --> 04:55.420
and that's why I didn't really know
if I'm gonna run or not,

04:55.503 --> 04:59.215
because I didn't want to run
if she's not 100% behind it.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.718
I was sitting with her in the Jacuzzi,
and I said, "By the way,

05:01.801 --> 05:04.637
what do you think
about me running for governor?"

05:04.721 --> 05:06.639
She just, you know, flipped out.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.182
I mean, she was just…

05:08.266 --> 05:10.601
I almost felt like
she was hyperventilating,

05:10.685 --> 05:13.062
because she's always felt kind of like,

05:13.146 --> 05:15.606
"I've gone through this with my family."

05:15.690 --> 05:19.610
[reporter] From Dallas, Texas, the flash.
President Kennedy is dead.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.778
[reporter 2] …assassination.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.363
[reporter 3] Robert Kennedy was shot.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.241
[reporter 4] A shooting by an unknown
assailant at the Ambassador Hotel.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.452
[Arnold] A very emotional reaction.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.580
She was really going through
some serious trauma.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.958
He's gonna end this war.
It's gonna end under McGovern and Shriver.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.710
It's not ending under Nixon.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.920
[reporter 5] Senator Edward M. Kennedy
drove a car

05:38.004 --> 05:40.590
off a narrow bridge and into a pond.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.009
A young woman
in the car with him was drowned.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.220
[Arnold] And you know, "Being in power,
it's horrible. You lose your privacy."

05:46.304 --> 05:49.015
"This would drag us through the mud."

05:49.682 --> 05:52.894
And so, therefore,
I pulled back on the idea.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.688
[reporter 6] Davis may have
one less distraction

05:55.772 --> 05:59.942
when Arnold Schwarzenegger appears
on The Tonight Show next Wednesday,

06:00.026 --> 06:04.572
the day he is expected to announce
he will not enter the recall election.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.408
That would clear the way
for Schwarzenegger's friend,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.994
former Los Angeles mayor, Richard Riordan.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.624
[Arnold]
Dick Riordan ran for governor in 2002.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.125
If he wants to run again

06:16.667 --> 06:17.752
in the recall,

06:17.835 --> 06:19.045
I would support him.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.965
So I went over there
for dinner with him at his house.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.135
Went out for a walk on the beach.

06:27.011 --> 06:30.431
He says, "You know, Arnold,
I have to be honest with you."

06:30.515 --> 06:32.225
"I don't feel like running."

06:32.308 --> 06:34.519
"I don't have the fire in the belly."

06:35.853 --> 06:37.647
He says, "But you should run."

06:38.439 --> 06:41.192
And I said to him, I said, "Wow. Pfft."

06:43.486 --> 06:45.154
If there's any higher power,

06:45.696 --> 06:48.825
it couldn't have been
presented to me in a better way.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.747
The morning of The Tonight Show,

06:54.831 --> 06:58.418
Maria actually put a note
under my bathroom door…

07:00.628 --> 07:01.921
that said,

07:02.004 --> 07:05.675
"In case you decide to run,
here's what I would say."

07:06.259 --> 07:08.886
"And here is if you decide not to run,

07:09.387 --> 07:10.513
what I would say."

07:11.097 --> 07:12.390
I felt like, okay,

07:12.473 --> 07:14.809
now Maria, for the first time,

07:15.518 --> 07:17.687
is open to the idea.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.647
That feels

07:20.314 --> 07:21.399
great,

07:21.482 --> 07:23.985
that I can go to The Tonight Show

07:24.068 --> 07:27.321
and then whatever comes out
of my mouth, go with that.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.906
Let me ask you about this now.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.785
I know it's been weeks
and people going back and forth.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.120
[murmurs]

07:34.203 --> 07:35.538
It's taken you awhile.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.917
You said you'd come here tonight
and tell us your decision.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.544
[Leno] I thought he was not running.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.881
I felt like a bit of a hypocrite,
because when he said he was coming,

07:44.964 --> 07:47.091
it was like… even in the dressing room.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.093
"We'll talk
and you'll see what you'll do?"

07:49.177 --> 07:50.303
He goes, "Yeah." Okay.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.680
All right. I said, "Well, all right,"
you know.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.225
I figured we'd get it over quickly
and I'd say, "Oh, too bad."

07:56.309 --> 07:59.479
The man that is failing the people
more than anyone

07:59.979 --> 08:01.105
is Gray Davis.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.690
[cheering and applause]

08:03.941 --> 08:04.775
Okay.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.987
He's failing them terribly,

08:08.070 --> 08:10.531
and this is why he needs to be recalled.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.449
[Leno] Mm-hmm.

08:11.532 --> 08:15.286
And this is why I'm going to run
for governor of the state of California.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.371
[cheering and applause]

08:24.170 --> 08:25.838
I was stunned, 'cause I thought,

08:25.922 --> 08:28.132
"You're the biggest movie star.
What are you doing?"

08:29.425 --> 08:30.885
I was stunned and shocked,

08:30.968 --> 08:34.222
and it just seemed like
a madcap thing to do.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.057
For me, that was absurd.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.767
I think it was, like, ridiculous.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.560
He wanted to become governor.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.730
You know, what are you… Please.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.109
Who knew he was spending that time
preparing for his biggest part?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.237
I remember thinking, like,

08:49.320 --> 08:50.780
"Hmm. Yeah."

08:51.489 --> 08:52.323
"He'll win."

08:53.199 --> 08:54.534
"He'll win, for sure."

08:55.284 --> 08:57.828
I knew if Arnold ran,
that would be serious,

08:57.912 --> 09:00.122
because he's not a normal politician.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.791
He's part of the Kennedy family.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.586
Having all that come
as part of the package with Arnold,

09:05.670 --> 09:07.296
that's a huge advantage.

09:08.172 --> 09:12.176
The very agents
and managers and studio executives

09:12.260 --> 09:13.928
that said to me in the '70s,

09:14.011 --> 09:17.056
"You will never make it,
don't even get into acting,"

09:17.139 --> 09:19.892
are the very same that said,
"Are you crazy?"

09:19.976 --> 09:22.812
"You're making $20-30,000,000
a movie now."

09:22.895 --> 09:25.815
But the more someone says that you can't

09:25.898 --> 09:29.277
or this is impossible,
the more I get excited over it.

09:32.196 --> 09:36.158
[woman] Within about three or four hours
of Arnold announcing on Leno,

09:36.242 --> 09:40.079
I'm sitting in, you know,
Arnold and Maria's living room…

09:42.290 --> 09:43.791
and it turned out

09:43.874 --> 09:46.210
that he had no staff,

09:46.294 --> 09:47.753
no real plan,

09:47.837 --> 09:48.963
uh, no people.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.801
You know, we didn't have a name.
We didn't have a theme.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.094
We didn't have anything.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.888
Literally, we all called
everybody we knew.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.890
[Murphy] I was already in LA.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.518
Dick Riordan had hired me,
who was thinking of running

10:02.602 --> 10:03.644
in the recall for governor.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.438
I went to have breakfast with Riordan.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.940
I had a new poll
and getting ready to launch the campaign.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.860
He said, "Now I'm gonna be for Arnold.
Come with me."

10:10.943 --> 10:13.779
Drive over to Oak Productions in Venice,

10:13.863 --> 10:15.531
and I meet Arnold Schwarzenegger.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.993
The Arnold thing was so big
and so much press attention.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.162
It was almost like
a mini presidential campaign.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.581
[overlapping chatter]

10:23.664 --> 10:26.626
[man] Arnold got in,
and the interest level went from here to…

10:26.709 --> 10:27.752
[imitates explosion]

10:27.835 --> 10:31.797
You know, it became interesting, kind of
"California, there they go again" story

10:31.881 --> 10:34.884
to all of a sudden, it blew up.
It became a worldwide phenomenon.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.638
Hollywood hard man Arnold Schwarzenegger
is hoping for a new goal.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.723
[speaking French]

10:41.974 --> 10:43.976
[reporter speaking German]

10:46.062 --> 10:48.439
[reporter in English] The election
will be as action-packed

10:48.522 --> 10:50.191
as one of his blockbuster movies.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.443
[reporter 2] And he is married
to JFK's niece.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.944
[Barabak] He's married to a Kennedy.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.031
He's not one
of those crazy, nutty right-wingers.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.617
-Get a good close-up, okay?
-[chuckles]

10:59.700 --> 11:02.536
Her writing,
then you pull the camera lens up

11:02.620 --> 11:04.288
and get a shot of Maria.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.540
[Arnold] Maria had the idea

11:06.624 --> 11:10.002
that I have to be connected
with the people as much as possible.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.712
She saw me over the years,

11:11.796 --> 11:14.674
and how much I thrive
when people are around.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.342
Because you have to have fun.

11:16.425 --> 11:18.844
This is the attitude.
It's like, let's have fun.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.014
This is all about fun and work
and fun and work.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.145
Most people don't know that.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.690
They worry

11:30.773 --> 11:31.899
and they work

11:32.400 --> 11:33.526
and they worry

11:34.026 --> 11:35.069
and they work.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.154
Where's the fun?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.615
This is fun.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.827
This is a six-wheeler,
so it goes through the snow

11:42.910 --> 11:44.495
and it is really…

11:45.413 --> 11:47.164
It's a safe vehicle to drive,

11:47.665 --> 11:50.751
and it's a fun vehicle to drive.
In essence, a toy.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.294
Do I need it? No.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.963
But, I mean, it's like a toy.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.841
You know, boys and their toys.
You know, we never grow up.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.429
[Barabak] The recall might've been
the best story in 40 years.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.180
It was captivating. It was fascinating.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.891
It was something
that no one had ever seen before.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.560
I call it political burlesque.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.979
♪ One step beyond! ♪

12:10.521 --> 12:12.773
[reporter] Californians are lining up
to get on the ballot.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.817
[reporter 2]
It doesn't take much to qualify,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.611
just 65 signatures and 3,500 bucks.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.448
[reporter 3] The list includes
one-time actor Gary Coleman

12:20.531 --> 12:22.116
from the hit show Different Strokes.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.493
[Barabak] You had Mary Carey,
the adult film actress.

12:24.577 --> 12:28.247
[reporter 4] And a retired policeman who
wants ferrets legalized as household pets.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.083
[reporter 5] Then there's
the porn publisher, Larry Flynt.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.377
Vote for a smut peddler who cares.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.214
[reporter 3] And bit-part actress
and billboard queen, Angelyne.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.676
We've had enough Gray and Brown,
and we need pink in California.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.636
[reporter 4]
The cult of celebrity gone mad.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.556
[reporter 3]
So why not a wealthy Austrian bodybuilder?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.352
I loved those guys,

12:51.145 --> 12:54.315
because I was already
kind of an odd person.

12:54.815 --> 12:55.941
Bodybuilder.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.568
Actor.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.903
From Austria.

12:58.986 --> 13:03.115
So now, how do I make myself
kind of, like, normal?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.285
By having everyone else weirder, right?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.955
[man] Two, one.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.375
My candidacy is all about
big change in Sacramento,

13:13.459 --> 13:16.086
and the people have a right to know
what that means for them.

13:16.170 --> 13:20.049
I knew that that was my strength,
to communicate and to penetrate,

13:20.132 --> 13:22.384
not just the brain, but the heart.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.470
If you want to change this state,

13:24.553 --> 13:25.805
then join me.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
Let's bring California back.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.475
-[man] Very good.
-Right?

13:29.558 --> 13:30.392
[woman] Yeah.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.147
[reporter] Arnold Schwarzenegger
entered like a champion

13:35.231 --> 13:39.610
and seemed not to notice when an egg
landed squarely on his broad shoulder.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.654
[Murphy] The media is a business.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.407
And so if you've got something interesting
for clicks and ratings,

13:45.491 --> 13:46.450
they're gonna show up.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.412
This guy owes me bacon now,
'cause you can't have eggs without bacon.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.790
-Hey, guys. How are you doing?
-[man] Hey, Arnold.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.792
Punchy points. Funny line or two.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.879
Gray Davis has terminated hope.
Gray Davis has terminated opportunities.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.923
And now it's time we terminate him!

14:01.006 --> 14:02.258
Short stump.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.344
Something has gone
terribly wrong in this state.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.805
[Murphy] Pump the crowd. Pandemonium.
Throw some stuff.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.765
[cheering]

14:09.849 --> 14:11.559
-On to the next one.
-[cameras clicking]

14:11.642 --> 14:14.311
[reporter] Didn't Mr. Buffett talk
to the Wall Street Journal

14:14.395 --> 14:17.565
about the unfairness of Proposition 13?

14:17.648 --> 14:19.275
First of all, I told Warren

14:19.358 --> 14:23.279
if he mentions Prop 13 one more time,
he has to do 500 sit-ups.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.196
[laughing]

14:24.280 --> 14:28.409
So he is not gonna talk about that
ever again, I can guarantee you.

14:28.492 --> 14:32.413
[Arnold] It was very clear that the people
wanted to recall Gray Davis.

14:32.496 --> 14:36.333
It was very clear that the people
felt comfortable with the idea

14:36.417 --> 14:39.712
of having him replaced
with an outsider like me.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.216
[reporter] The Super Bowl of debates
is just an hour away.

14:44.300 --> 14:48.012
[reporter 2] The top candidates vying
to replace Governor Davis in what could be

14:48.095 --> 14:50.598
the most watched debate
in California political history,

14:50.681 --> 14:52.641
perhaps because of one man.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.478
[reporter 3] If he stumbles,
he could be in real danger.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.356
[Arnold] Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.776
We're gonna go and study
the policy issues.

15:02.860 --> 15:08.657
But… that should be half of the practice.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.578
The other half of the time
we should spend on the characters

15:12.661 --> 15:14.663
that will be involved in the debate.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.166
I did exactly what I did in bodybuilding.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.294
I did my training, but I also was thinking

15:20.377 --> 15:23.255
about how can I
derail them psychologically.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.550
In California,
we have a three strikes system.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.594
You guys put wool
over the people's eyes twice.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.012
The third time, now you are out.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.057
On October 7th, you guys are out.
It's that simple, okay?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.851
I had my comedy writers
write up some jokes.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.730
So whenever I did not know
the issues well, I would use the jokes.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.106
One more thing, Arnold.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.983
-You talk about the three--
-[Arnold] Arnold?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.277
-Yes. You talk--
-Let me just say one thing.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.322
Your personal income tax
have the biggest loophole.

15:48.405 --> 15:51.951
I could drive my Hummer through it,
that's how big it is. Let me tell you.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.119
-Let me finish.
-We're talking about income tax.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.455
-Not about education.
-[Ariana] This is impolite.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.959
This is the way you treat women,
we know that, but not now.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.631
I just realized I have
the perfect part for you in Terminator 4.

16:05.714 --> 16:06.882
That's it.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.642
[woman] When Schwarzenegger announced
he was running for governor,

16:16.725 --> 16:20.854
the staff of the LA Times
immediately went into high gear

16:20.938 --> 16:24.441
to start looking into
stories that we had heard

16:24.942 --> 16:25.985
for years,

16:26.068 --> 16:31.031
but no one had actually
really investigated them fully.

16:31.573 --> 16:35.911
We had barely six weeks to work on this,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.747
and we started talking to women.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.583
We found these women

16:41.667 --> 16:43.711
by talking to people in Hollywood,

16:43.794 --> 16:45.295
people who were sources,

16:45.379 --> 16:47.339
and we just started reporting.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.301
[Murphy] We'd get the call
from the LA Times,

16:51.385 --> 16:53.679
"Hey, we're going
in a couple hours with this story."

16:53.762 --> 16:56.015
"Well, what's the name of the accuser?"
"Won't tell you."

16:56.098 --> 16:59.768
"When did it happen?"
"Uh, one year. Won't tell you."

17:01.061 --> 17:04.106
The next morning,
we are to kick off a bus tour

17:04.189 --> 17:07.526
from San Diego all the way up,
wind up in Sacramento

17:07.609 --> 17:09.695
with 10,000 people at the Capitol.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.113
[announcer] Arnold Schwarzenegger!

17:11.196 --> 17:15.451
-[cheering and applause]
-And then…

17:15.534 --> 17:17.494
[reporter] A graphic article
on the front page

17:17.578 --> 17:19.455
of today's Los Angeles Times

17:20.039 --> 17:22.750
detailing the allegations
of a half-dozen women.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.586
[reporter 2] Among the claims,
that he groped their breasts,

17:25.669 --> 17:27.546
made lewd sexual suggestions,

17:27.629 --> 17:30.966
and tried to remove
one woman's bathing suit in an elevator.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.429
The paper quotes one woman as saying,
"Did he rape me? No."

17:35.512 --> 17:38.140
"Did he humiliate me? You bet he did."

17:38.640 --> 17:41.101
We weren't going to write
about just one woman.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.812
We wanted to see a pattern of behavior,

17:43.896 --> 17:44.897
which we found,

17:44.980 --> 17:48.275
and it took place
over a course of decades.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.360
[cheering and applause]

17:50.444 --> 17:52.446
[Hall] As soon as the first story ran,

17:52.529 --> 17:54.406
people were really angry at us.

17:55.324 --> 17:59.578
People immediately accused us
of holding the story

17:59.661 --> 18:02.164
until five days before the election.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.459
It ran October 2nd
because that's how long it took.

18:05.542 --> 18:09.046
You know, when you get into politics,
they try to tear down your character,

18:09.129 --> 18:10.923
tear down everything you stand for.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.634
And as you know,
this morning they have begun

18:13.717 --> 18:15.052
with the tearing down.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.262
Yes, absolutely.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.722
Let me tell you something.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.226
A lot of those what you see
in the stories is not true.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.311
[cheering and applause]

18:26.188 --> 18:29.191
But at the same time,
I have to tell you that I always say

18:29.274 --> 18:31.860
that wherever there is smoke,
there's fire.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.029
That is true.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.865
And so,
what I want to say to you is that yes,

18:37.491 --> 18:40.035
that I have behaved badly sometimes.

18:40.577 --> 18:44.456
Yes, it is true
that I was on rowdy movie sets

18:44.540 --> 18:47.835
and I've done things that were not right,
which I thought was playful,

18:47.918 --> 18:51.797
but now I recognize
that I have offended people.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.341
And to those people that I have offended,

18:54.424 --> 18:55.801
I want to say to them,

18:55.884 --> 18:57.845
I am deeply sorry about that

18:57.928 --> 18:59.138
and I apologize,

18:59.221 --> 19:01.348
because this is not what I'm trying to do.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.933
[cheering and applause]

19:03.016 --> 19:04.601
[horn honking]

19:05.227 --> 19:08.230
This is crazy.
You know they try to tear you down.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.650
They try to tear your character down
and everything you stand for.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.610
You can listen to all the negativity,

19:13.694 --> 19:16.405
and you can listen to people
who have never met Arnold

19:16.488 --> 19:19.116
or who met him
for five seconds 30 years ago,

19:19.199 --> 19:20.784
or you can listen to me.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.912
-I advise you to listen to me.
-[applause]

19:23.996 --> 19:25.622
[Hall] The day that it ran,

19:25.706 --> 19:27.291
all hell broke loose.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.920
My email inbox was flooded.
People were calling us with tips.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.881
We had so many tips

19:33.964 --> 19:36.800
that we had to put
more reporters on the story.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.052
[reporter] This morning's
Los Angeles Times reporting

19:39.136 --> 19:41.930
that more women have accused
Schwarzenegger of groping them,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.724
bringing the total to 15.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.684
[Arnold] I am sorry,

19:46.768 --> 19:49.104
and I apologize to anyone

19:49.188 --> 19:50.606
that I have offended.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.568
As the days went forward,

19:54.651 --> 19:56.737
he kind of changed his tune.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.156
He would talk to other interviewers

19:59.239 --> 20:00.741
and pull it back.

20:00.824 --> 20:01.867
[horn honks]

20:01.950 --> 20:04.244
[Arnold] Well, first of all,
a lot of it is made up.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.455
I've never grabbed anyone

20:06.538 --> 20:09.166
and then pulled up their shirt
and rub their breasts and stuff.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.167
This is not me.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.503
-You deny all stories about grabbing?
-No, not all.

20:14.338 --> 20:18.425
My reaction in the beginning…
I was kind of, like, defensive.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.595
We cannot have a governor who gropes women

20:21.678 --> 20:22.971
and tries to deny it.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.306
[crowd clamoring]

20:24.389 --> 20:26.850
[Arnold] Today,
I can look at it and kind of say,

20:26.934 --> 20:28.435
"It doesn't really matter

20:29.686 --> 20:31.188
what time it is."

20:32.272 --> 20:34.107
If it's the Muscle Beach days

20:34.191 --> 20:35.651
or 40 years ago

20:36.360 --> 20:37.319
or today.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.820
This was wrong.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.241
It was bullshit.
Forget all the excuses. This was wrong.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.369
Things happen.
People are young and they do things.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.579
We do not care. We need leadership.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.165
-Are you gonna vote for him?
-Yeah, absolutely.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.209
[cheering]

20:52.292 --> 20:56.296
Personally, I was surprised
that it didn't have more of an effect

20:56.380 --> 20:57.464
on the election.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.717
I thought that more people would be

21:02.261 --> 21:03.595
offended themselves.

21:04.554 --> 21:08.308
[man] I don't think attacks
on his character were ever going to work.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.894
I mean,
I'm convinced by seeing the polling

21:10.978 --> 21:13.814
that our story, rather than sinking him,

21:13.897 --> 21:15.440
made him surge at the end.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.735
♪ We're not gonna take it ♪

[singer] Thank you, Sacramento!

21:45.095 --> 21:47.097
There's a new governor in town!

21:47.180 --> 21:49.308
His name's Arnold Schwarzenegger!

21:49.391 --> 21:50.851
[cheering]

21:52.686 --> 21:56.690
[reporter] When Schwarzenegger took
the stage, someone handed him a broom.

21:56.773 --> 22:00.068
We are here,
ladies and gentlemen, to clean house!

22:00.152 --> 22:01.570
We are here to clean house!

22:01.653 --> 22:03.405
[cheering]

22:03.488 --> 22:06.491
[reporter] Today, with polls
still showing the recall passing

22:06.575 --> 22:08.702
and Schwarzenegger winning
the governorship,

22:08.785 --> 22:12.581
his aides confidently predicted
the stories about his past behavior

22:12.664 --> 22:14.041
won't have much impact.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.260
-[Arnold] Good morning.
-[Maria] Good morning. Good morning.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.682
-[woman] Just stick it in the box.
-[Arnold] Okay, like this.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.145
-It's in God's hands.
-[man] God's hands.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.397
It's up to God,
therefore, the decision is…

22:37.481 --> 22:40.984
We did all the work,
and we worked hard and campaigned hard.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.948
[reporter] The polls
have just closed here,

22:47.032 --> 22:51.411
and CBS News now estimates that
when all the votes are in and counted,

22:51.495 --> 22:56.208
Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger
has won the race to succeed Davis.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.293
[Arnold] In your mind, you have won,

22:59.336 --> 23:01.171
but all of this is

23:02.047 --> 23:03.256
out in the clouds.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.803
But then, when the reality sets in,

23:09.346 --> 23:10.680
it was, like, so powerful.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.016
I mean, I had tears in my… in my eyes.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.187
I will never forget this moment.
It was just so unbelievable.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.773
[cheering]

23:33.912 --> 23:35.497
I remember the joy

23:35.580 --> 23:38.834
when they announced me to be Mr. Universe.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.294
A standing ovation in London.

23:43.463 --> 23:45.298
When I got my citizenship.

23:48.051 --> 23:51.012
When Katherine was born,
the first baby coming out.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.725
All of these moments I remember, but this

23:56.393 --> 23:59.813
was just so profound, so big.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.274
It was like… It was really overwhelming.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.735
Yeah.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.030
Thank you very much. Thank you.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.116
And God bless all of you.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.284
Thank you.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.119
These people

24:15.245 --> 24:16.663
trusted you

24:16.746 --> 24:19.749
and said, "Yeah, we want you to lead us."

24:20.333 --> 24:21.168
Wow.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.171
[crowd chanting]

24:29.801 --> 24:30.927
[cheering]

24:45.817 --> 24:49.321
You know, photos say
more than 1,000 words, right?

24:49.404 --> 24:51.406
So I mean, it's like this is saying,

24:52.782 --> 24:54.993
"Even though Arnold was the governor,

24:55.494 --> 24:59.247
he never tried to sell out
and do the kind of things

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
that politicians normally do."

25:01.416 --> 25:05.170
No politician is gonna have
alligator boots

25:06.087 --> 25:07.506
and flaunt it like that.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.260
And I didn't hide my Cuban cigars either.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.764
I smoke because people should know
that's who I am.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.687
When I ran for governor,
there was a lot of things I didn't know.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.898
But one thing I knew,

25:24.981 --> 25:28.610
that I'm going to serve
the people of California

25:28.693 --> 25:31.446
and I'm not gonna serve just my party.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.615
I'm not gonna be a party hack.

25:33.698 --> 25:37.202
I'm gonna be a public servant
and serve the people.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.328
That I knew.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.498
[reporter] Former bodybuilder
and actor Schwarzenegger

25:41.581 --> 25:43.750
has started the third phase
of his professional life.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.711
[reporter 2] Schwarzenegger will be
sworn in as California's 38th governor.

25:46.795 --> 25:50.715
[reporter 3] …with 700 credentialed media,
7,500 invited guests,

25:50.799 --> 25:53.677
a couple thousand more
un-ticketed stargazers,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.346
and Vanessa Williams
as part of the program.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.306
This is gonna take some getting used to.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.518
[man] I will now ask you,
please, to place your left hand

26:01.601 --> 26:04.062
on this historic family bible.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.815
Raise your right hand.
Repeat the Oath of Office.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.276
[Arnold] And from then on,
now you have to shift gears.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.778
Part of you has to go,

26:12.696 --> 26:16.157
because you are not now
representing anymore Arnold,

26:16.241 --> 26:18.743
you're now representing 40 million people.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.203
I am humbled.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.705
I am moved,

26:21.788 --> 26:23.915
and I am honored beyond words

26:23.999 --> 26:25.208
to be your governor.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.751
[cheering and applause]

26:26.835 --> 26:28.086
You get sworn in

26:28.169 --> 26:30.171
and you're kind of standing there
like a puppy.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.924
You know… [panting]

26:34.175 --> 26:35.093
All excited.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.556
When I think about any character

26:39.639 --> 26:41.349
that I played in the movies,

26:41.433 --> 26:42.726
Julius, actually,

26:42.809 --> 26:45.103
was the character that I am really.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.814
Julius is the character in Twins.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.944
He's kind of the innocent guy
that had a mind like a sponge.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.614
But he still had to learn,

26:56.114 --> 26:57.907
and he had this kind of, like,

26:58.491 --> 26:59.701
open mind.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.078
[woman] Governor!

27:02.162 --> 27:04.122
[applause]

27:05.832 --> 27:07.417
[Arnold] I went into the office,

27:08.043 --> 27:10.003
and I was sitting there,

27:10.086 --> 27:12.380
and I kind of felt lost.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.174
-Makeup, please. No.
-[laughing]

27:14.257 --> 27:15.800
[Arnold] How does this work in here now?

27:17.093 --> 27:18.637
How do we get going here?

27:19.929 --> 27:21.514
What do I do in my office?

27:21.598 --> 27:25.185
Sit there and wait for them
to bring me an issue or a bill?

27:25.268 --> 27:27.520
And so that's why
I went around the Capitol,

27:27.604 --> 27:32.025
and I visited the Speaker's office.
I visited the President Pro Temp's office.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.235
And we would sit down,
and we would schmooze.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.113
[man] Arnold was blessed

27:37.864 --> 27:40.867
with the absence of knowledge

27:41.785 --> 27:44.120
about how other people did it.
[chuckles]

27:44.204 --> 27:47.123
He did it the way

27:47.707 --> 27:49.376
it needed to be done,

27:49.876 --> 27:51.836
without the political baggage.

27:52.545 --> 27:53.755
Hello, everybody.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.799
[Arnold] During the campaign,

27:55.882 --> 27:58.468
I would use everything that I could,

27:58.551 --> 28:01.763
my movie career,
that I'm married to a Democrat,

28:01.846 --> 28:04.724
to show that I'm with them.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.893
This is Twins 2. Look at this.

28:06.976 --> 28:07.936
[laughing]

28:08.019 --> 28:09.270
Twins 2.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.691
That's why I then decided
when I became governor

28:12.774 --> 28:16.152
that I should actually
have a smoking tent.

28:16.236 --> 28:20.615
And it was not so much about smoking.
It was just a social place.

28:22.242 --> 28:25.453
We were very successful
in bringing legislators down,

28:25.537 --> 28:29.749
Democrats and Republicans, and I just sat
outside in the tent and schmoozed.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.251
These were total strangers.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.086
-How are you?
-[woman] Would you like a cigar?

28:33.169 --> 28:36.548
-[man] Good to see you.
-Senator, you gonna join us this time?

28:37.882 --> 28:41.052
The smoking tent is not a tent.
The smoking tent is a stage.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.597
All the people in the offices up
and in his office

28:44.681 --> 28:46.391
could see who was in the smoking tent.

28:46.474 --> 28:50.937
"Why am I not in the tent talking to him?
I need an idea that goes there."

28:51.438 --> 28:53.898
It's unsettling,
because people that met with him

28:53.982 --> 28:56.317
could see that they were being watched.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.737
He's totally comfortable being watched.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.114
[Wachter] That's strategic.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.949
Part of that persona,

29:03.032 --> 29:05.535
apart from the fact
that he's just a likable guy,

29:05.618 --> 29:07.412
is that he's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

29:07.495 --> 29:10.832
He's the most famous guy in the world,
and he knows that.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.751
-[Wachter] Very nice.
-[Arnold] Yeah.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.045
[Wachter] Freakin' perfect.

29:21.050 --> 29:25.180
[woman] Property tax for state-mandated
programs that you could only…

29:25.263 --> 29:27.682
[Arnold] It was staggering to sit there

29:27.766 --> 29:30.268
from sometimes nine o'clock in the morning

29:30.351 --> 29:33.897
and have one meeting after the next,

29:33.980 --> 29:35.940
where you learn about things

29:36.024 --> 29:38.151
that you have not even thought about.

29:39.277 --> 29:42.197
I remember when the day was over,
I went home and I said to my wife,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.324
"The things that I learned today…"

29:44.407 --> 29:47.619
"There is no university in the world

29:47.702 --> 29:50.371
that can teach you those kind of issues."

29:50.455 --> 29:51.414
Passing legislation…

29:51.498 --> 29:54.417
[Arnold] But then how do you make
this policy come alive

29:54.501 --> 29:56.252
and then turn it into reality?

29:56.753 --> 30:00.215
Wouldn't it be the best
if we could get it to the people?

30:00.298 --> 30:02.509
[suspenseful music plays]

30:03.176 --> 30:07.847
[Arnold] Whenever you feel like you don't
have success with the legislators

30:07.931 --> 30:11.142
and you have
a strong personality like myself,

30:11.893 --> 30:13.645
you can use that as a weapon,

30:14.229 --> 30:17.065
and you go
and speak directly to the people.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.360
We went out and collected signatures.

30:20.443 --> 30:23.154
-Thank you. Exactly.
-Bring it back to where it was.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.990
Every time we had
another 100,000 signatures,

30:26.074 --> 30:27.742
I would put it on the desk

30:27.826 --> 30:29.953
of the Democratic Senate Pro Temp.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.789
This initiative strategy

30:32.872 --> 30:35.124
is a very old strategy in California.

30:35.208 --> 30:39.295
Politicians often use the process
as leverage to get legislation.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.549
He just did it on a scale
that we had never seen before.

30:42.632 --> 30:44.467
Traveling up and down the state

30:44.551 --> 30:48.179
to just let the people know that now is
the time for the people to get involved.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.307
[Mathews] That created
the conditions and urgency to get a deal.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.854
[Arnold] The legislators
started doing polls,

30:55.937 --> 30:57.647
and sure enough they saw

30:57.730 --> 30:59.941
that it would actually win,

31:00.024 --> 31:02.944
and therefore they stayed
at the negotiating table

31:03.027 --> 31:04.654
and we negotiated a great deal.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.739
[cheering and applause]

31:10.660 --> 31:13.621
[reporter] Many thought the Republican
would fall on his face,

31:13.705 --> 31:15.081
that the political neophyte

31:15.164 --> 31:19.210
simply would not be able to tackle
the massive problems of California.

31:19.294 --> 31:23.381
Voters follow his lead
simply because of who he is.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.302
[Arnold] I mean, I am a Republican
and I want to work with Democrats.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.220
I want to let them know first,

31:29.804 --> 31:31.431
"I don't want to screw you,

31:31.931 --> 31:36.394
except what we agreed upon
to screw each other."

31:36.477 --> 31:40.106
The only thing worse than
a poor loser is a poor winner.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.608
-Exactly.
-[Burton] I'm a poor loser.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.942
-No.
-You fucked me on my bill.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.529
[Arnold] Sometimes you go
and you make a deal behind the scene,

31:46.613 --> 31:49.616
and then you go out and attack each other
in front of the press

31:49.699 --> 31:52.035
in order to satisfy your constituents.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.745
That's saying enough for McClintock,

31:53.828 --> 31:56.247
the man who says
what he means when he loses.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.749
Bad winner, good loser.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.085
It's bullshit, right?

32:01.169 --> 32:04.297
A little Schmäh here,
a little bullshit there. This and that.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.424
But that's politics.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.842
[cheering]

32:07.926 --> 32:09.886
[Clarey] We thought,
"Well, we've got the formula."

32:09.969 --> 32:13.848
He was right more than he was wrong,
but we're all wrong sometimes.

32:14.682 --> 32:18.353
Give me the tools
so we can reform the broken system.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.772
Thank you very much, and I'll be back.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.107
[Mathews] His impatience started
to work against him,

32:23.191 --> 32:26.611
and also he was always on,
and people got a little tired of it.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.323
No one wanted to give him a deal,
and they decided to beat him.

32:30.406 --> 32:34.035
[Arnold] I'm not about to change
anything of my reforms

32:34.118 --> 32:36.329
because I have a few nurses protesting

32:36.412 --> 32:38.289
or a few teachers protesting.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.666
Schwarzenegger has got to go!

32:39.749 --> 32:43.169
[Arnold] My mouth has been
one of my biggest assets.

32:43.252 --> 32:48.174
I hope that those that want
to sell out to the special interests,

32:48.758 --> 32:51.427
those girlie men up there in Sacramento…

32:52.303 --> 32:55.223
But at the same time,
it is one of my biggest liabilities also.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.017
Why would I possibly call him?

32:58.101 --> 32:59.352
I mean, are you people nuts?

33:00.228 --> 33:03.606
"Hi, this is the scumbag girlie-boy.
How you doing?"

33:04.273 --> 33:07.193
Voters rejected every initiative
he proposed.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.035
[cameras clicking]

33:18.538 --> 33:20.373
Good afternoon, everybody.

33:20.456 --> 33:24.460
I was with him just before he had
to go face the Capitol Press Corps

33:24.544 --> 33:27.296
and the people of California
in the face of that defeat.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.465
And I ask him, "What are you feeling?"

33:29.549 --> 33:31.926
He said,
"I should have listened to Maria."

33:33.261 --> 33:37.682
You know, I think that
I operate with a different mentality

33:37.765 --> 33:39.517
than most people do,

33:39.600 --> 33:43.312
uh, which is that I am, uh, very forceful

33:43.855 --> 33:46.065
and, uh, impatient.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.400
As governor,

33:47.483 --> 33:49.360
or I think any politician,

33:49.444 --> 33:51.320
I think you have to be more patient.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.492
And I think
that, uh, I recognize that now,

33:56.576 --> 33:58.536
more so than I did before.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.291
[Zingale] I think that was
the beginning of him growing into the job

34:03.374 --> 34:05.626
and recognizing that, um,

34:05.710 --> 34:09.088
he didn't want to be some tool
of conventional Republicans

34:09.172 --> 34:10.923
just based on his celebrity.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.134
He wanted to govern by who he was

34:13.217 --> 34:14.427
and who he was with.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.848
I have always two sides fighting.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.851
There's the left side
and the right Arnold, right?

34:21.934 --> 34:24.562
They're always arguing
about everything, about politics,

34:24.645 --> 34:27.148
about how to deal with
various different issues,

34:27.231 --> 34:28.357
and everything like that.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.901
It's just the way it is with me.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.445
How do you convince people
you're a Centrist

34:32.528 --> 34:34.530
and not a dyed-in-the-wool Republican?

34:34.614 --> 34:35.531
A lot of work.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.910
A lot of work,
and I'm willing to work hard to do that.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.954
Now I knew exactly
which direction I wanted to go

34:42.038 --> 34:44.624
with my, uh, administration,

34:44.707 --> 34:47.752
and I felt that maybe
I should bring new blood in.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.465
[Zingale] The first thing
I was called in to talk about

34:52.548 --> 34:55.051
was his choice of a new chief of staff.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.928
The most qualified candidate

34:57.011 --> 35:01.140
was a woman who had been the executive
director of the Democratic Party.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.767
She had been an abortion advocate.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.686
She was an out lesbian
and her last name was Kennedy.

35:05.770 --> 35:10.483
Your Republican colleagues are going to be
outraged by everything about this woman.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.527
And he got this gleam in his eye

35:12.610 --> 35:17.240
that I would later come to recognize
as delight in being disruptive.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.157
Exactly.

35:19.408 --> 35:20.243
Do it.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.745
Do it now.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.413
[adventurous music plays]

35:24.497 --> 35:26.207
[woman] I was waiting for a flight,

35:26.290 --> 35:28.543
and the call comes in from Zingale,

35:28.626 --> 35:34.882
and, uh, I literally just, you know,
started banging my head on the table,

35:34.966 --> 35:38.970
thinking, "Fuck,
why did you wait a year to call me?"

35:39.053 --> 35:42.515
I'm here today to introduce you
to my new chief of staff,

35:42.598 --> 35:43.766
Susan Kennedy.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.978
Tone it down.
Not so much applause, please.

35:47.061 --> 35:50.064
And when I started
picking Democrats for my team,

35:50.148 --> 35:55.403
they felt this…
is the influence of the Kennedys.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.908
In the meantime, Susan Kennedy
had no connections with the Kennedys.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.118
It was all bogus.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.247
I was fed up with Republicans,
she was fed up with Democrats,

36:06.330 --> 36:08.166
so we were kind of both in the middle.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.835
[Kennedy] I asked him,
"What do you wanna do?"

36:10.918 --> 36:13.004
"What do you want
to be remembered for as Governor?"

36:13.087 --> 36:16.841
He hesitated,
then he just said, "I want to build."

36:16.924 --> 36:19.343
Today, I propose

36:19.427 --> 36:22.346
a strategic growth plan
for California's future.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.808
[Kennedy] Arnold had this passion
for thinking ahead,

36:26.392 --> 36:27.810
for putting something in place

36:27.894 --> 36:31.314
that maybe doesn't happen
while you're still in office,

36:31.397 --> 36:35.067
but you're building something
that takes multiple administrations.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.903
So I say build it.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.071
[applause]

36:39.822 --> 36:43.701
[Arnold] Even though I'm known as a person
that has very little patience,

36:43.784 --> 36:47.371
but for projects I have a lot of patience.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.832
And so for building my body

36:49.916 --> 36:53.628
into a perfect body took
years and years and years,

36:53.711 --> 36:55.421
and the same is with infrastructure.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.173
Democrats and Republicans voted

36:57.256 --> 37:02.136
to approve a $37 billion
transportation infrastructure package.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.432
[Matthews] That was one
of the fastest 180s you'll ever see.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.727
This is the guy
who turns his boat towards the torpedo.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.979
And he flipped it really, really quickly.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.235
[Arnold ] There was Republicans
and Democrats together.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.528
Oh, the people love that.

37:20.988 --> 37:24.242
It really helped me
beat my reelection campaign,

37:24.325 --> 37:27.912
because I really didn't have to go out
and campaign.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.705
This was the campaign.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.375
[reporter] With just a month to go
before Election Day,

37:32.458 --> 37:35.419
California's Republican governor
is pumped up

37:35.503 --> 37:37.505
about his prospects of winning.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.924
[Arnold] And I won the governorship again.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.427
And the people were happy.
And everything was dandy and fine again.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.679
But that's politics.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.598
What a fantastic evening.
You know, I love doing sequels.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.685
I love… I love doing sequels.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.770
[cheering and applause]

37:58.276 --> 38:00.486
[Arnold] I maybe say, "I'm a Republican,

38:00.569 --> 38:03.114
and here is the way
I'd solve the problems."

38:03.614 --> 38:05.908
But then at the same time, I have to say,

38:05.992 --> 38:08.661
"What is it that the Democrat says

38:08.744 --> 38:11.455
about solving the problems,
and why do they think that?"

38:12.039 --> 38:15.710
I remember that Bobby Kennedy, Jr.,
when I ran for governor,

38:15.793 --> 38:19.880
he's a Democrat, and he calls me
and says, "I want to help you."

38:19.964 --> 38:20.798
I say, "How?"

38:20.881 --> 38:24.719
He says, "I'm gonna give you someone that
is the number one environmental expert."

38:24.802 --> 38:26.053
"Terry Tamminen."

38:26.637 --> 38:30.599
"Bring him onto your team
and talk about the environment."

38:32.184 --> 38:35.646
As a Democrat
and flame-throwing environmentalist,

38:35.730 --> 38:39.191
many friends said, "How could you
possibly help Arnold Schwarzenegger?"

38:39.275 --> 38:41.610
"He's a Republican."
I said, "Yeah, but look."

38:41.694 --> 38:44.739
"We want a Republican
to be saying the things we're saying,

38:44.822 --> 38:47.158
and I think Arnold is that Republican."

38:47.241 --> 38:49.493
These are the kind of things
we can accomplish

38:49.577 --> 38:51.620
if both parties work together.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.790
[Arnold] I set out to go
and do whatever I could

38:54.874 --> 38:58.586
to pass the strictest environmental laws
in California.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.756
I said, "Why would we
reduce greenhouse gases by 5%?"

39:01.839 --> 39:03.174
"That's bullshit."

39:03.883 --> 39:06.844
"That's fucking little thinking.
What's the matter with you guys?"

39:06.927 --> 39:09.847
"Let's reduce greenhouse gases by 25%."

39:10.848 --> 39:14.143
"And California has so much sun.
We're not using it."

39:14.727 --> 39:16.437
[reporter] Schwarzenegger
in San Francisco,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.189
announcing with great fanfare

39:18.272 --> 39:21.484
a California law to curb
emissions of greenhouse gases.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.487
In a few minutes,
we will be signing Assembly Bill 32.

39:24.570 --> 39:28.240
When we sign this bill,
we will begin a bold new era

39:28.324 --> 39:31.035
of environmental protection
here in California

39:31.118 --> 39:33.496
that will change the course of history.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.666
I realized that
we are onto something really big.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.503
We could be the leaders,
not only in California,

39:40.586 --> 39:42.838
but the leaders in America

39:43.339 --> 39:45.216
and the leaders in the world.

39:46.425 --> 39:50.554
California is moving the United States
beyond debate and doubt

39:50.638 --> 39:51.847
to action.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.141
So I urge this body

39:54.225 --> 39:56.977
to push its members to action also.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.356
And then when Obama was elected president,

40:00.439 --> 40:04.235
he then adopted our California
tailpipe emissions standards

40:04.318 --> 40:05.444
and made it national.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.031
And I want to applaud
California Governor Schwarzenegger

40:09.115 --> 40:12.910
and the entire California delegation
for their extraordinary leadership.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.787
They have led the way on this,

40:14.870 --> 40:18.416
as they have in so many other efforts,
to protect the environment.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.460
[man] When I became leader
of the Conservative Party in Britain,

40:21.544 --> 40:24.004
one of the first things I did
was to point out

40:24.088 --> 40:27.258
it is a Conservative thing
to be concerned about the environment.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.552
It was inspiring to see someone running

40:29.635 --> 40:32.179
one of the most important economies
in the world,

40:32.263 --> 40:36.517
but at the same time saying, "Actually,
these two things aren't in conflict."

40:36.600 --> 40:38.102
"If you want a growing economy,

40:38.185 --> 40:40.604
you need to have, long term,
a green economy too."

40:40.688 --> 40:43.816
And all agree to the net-zero,
so we're in good shape…

40:43.899 --> 40:45.192
[Arnold] When you step back,

40:45.276 --> 40:48.362
it's exciting
to kind of look at an issue like that,

40:48.446 --> 40:51.782
study and learn it, and then try
to figure out how can you help.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.285
And that opportunity for me

40:54.368 --> 40:56.370
to do something and to have an impact…

40:59.039 --> 41:00.291
When I was in movies,

41:00.374 --> 41:03.627
the kids would come to the studio
and they would do their homework.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.130
Then, whenever they called me to the set,

41:06.213 --> 41:09.300
they all run to the set and were waiting,
and then all the sudden, boom!

41:09.383 --> 41:11.844
There was a shootout
and everything was blowing up.

41:11.927 --> 41:13.554
"That was really cool. Wow."

41:13.637 --> 41:17.475
They were high-fiving each other.
So the kids loved all this stuff.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.685
So when I go to Sacramento,

41:19.768 --> 41:22.730
and then all the sudden
the kids visit me up there,

41:22.813 --> 41:23.689
they said,

41:24.190 --> 41:25.024
"Daddy."

41:26.150 --> 41:27.610
"I hate it here."

41:27.693 --> 41:31.530
"These people act so serious.
Why are they all wearing suits?"

41:31.614 --> 41:33.824
They just were absolutely in shock

41:33.908 --> 41:37.745
and despised my job.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.290
And then on top of it,

41:41.373 --> 41:45.211
then you spend four days a week
up in Sacramento,

41:45.294 --> 41:47.046
and my kids would say,

41:47.129 --> 41:49.632
"You didn't come
to my recital on Tuesday."

41:49.715 --> 41:52.343
"What about my basketball game
on Wednesday?"

41:52.426 --> 41:55.387
And I'd say, "I promised
to serve the people of California."

41:55.471 --> 41:58.140
"Yeah, but you promised
family's supposed to be number one."

41:58.224 --> 41:59.642
And they started crying.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.936
Maria didn't help much at all,

42:02.019 --> 42:04.647
because Maria says,
"Just express yourself, kids."

42:04.730 --> 42:08.234
"Let Daddy know how you really feel."
I said, "Thanks a lot."

42:10.611 --> 42:13.531
It was very important
to see each one of the kids

42:14.198 --> 42:15.324
have their needs,

42:15.908 --> 42:19.161
that your wife,
that the whole family has its needs,

42:19.245 --> 42:21.413
that how you have
to take vacations together,

42:21.497 --> 42:23.958
how you have to communicate
with the kids every night,

42:24.041 --> 42:26.502
that you don't just
stay upstairs with your goals,

42:26.585 --> 42:29.463
but then that becomes a more bigger goal.

42:30.673 --> 42:34.260
But that's a tough one to handle,
when you hear your kids complaining

42:34.843 --> 42:37.555
and your wife complaining
about you not being at home enough,

42:37.638 --> 42:40.474
when you know
you're not home because for a reason.

42:45.271 --> 42:48.274
Across the northern perimeter
of the fire, and, uh…

42:48.357 --> 42:50.442
[Arnold] When we had fires,

42:50.526 --> 42:52.278
and you go to bed

42:52.361 --> 42:56.323
and someone tells you that
there's 580 fires now in California…

42:57.533 --> 43:02.079
I got up at 5:00 in the morning
and then they told me there's 2,012 fires

43:02.162 --> 43:03.289
that morning.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.962
And you don't have enough resources.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.174
That was really the toughest thing
during those years.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.428
There is problems and problems
and problems.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.138
I mean, it doesn't stop.

43:19.221 --> 43:20.889
[bell ringing]

43:20.973 --> 43:24.560
[reporter] Tonight, the Dow plummets
as the financial world is rocked

43:24.643 --> 43:27.229
by the fate
of two powerhouse investment firms.

43:27.313 --> 43:29.189
[reporter 2]
The financial system is in crisis.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.692
The economic news goes from bad to worse.

43:31.775 --> 43:35.863
[reporter 3] Of all the states, California
may be in the worst financial shape.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.490
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
has proposed higher taxes

43:38.574 --> 43:40.618
and deep spending cuts.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.952
People are concerned

43:42.911 --> 43:45.039
that this state
is going to go off the cliff.

43:45.956 --> 43:47.916
[Kennedy]
Every governor faces a recession,

43:48.000 --> 43:50.961
and the one that hit on Arnold's watch
was a global recession.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.797
Everybody took a beating,
and Schwarzenegger went down in the polls

43:53.881 --> 43:55.424
like every politician did,

43:55.507 --> 43:58.427
but he actually left the state stronger

43:58.510 --> 44:00.804
than any governor
that faced it before him.

44:02.514 --> 44:06.727
Arnold Schwarzenegger was
the most ambitious governor

44:06.810 --> 44:10.230
California had
in the second half of the 20th century.

44:11.148 --> 44:14.610
He tried policies
of every flavor and stripe.

44:14.693 --> 44:20.449
They think he actually sort of
advanced us 25 years of stuff in seven.

44:21.617 --> 44:26.121
I think there were probably three things
that would be on the highlight reel.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.957
When it came to appointing
women and minorities as judges,

44:29.041 --> 44:32.336
he went out of his way
to find the best and the brightest

44:32.419 --> 44:35.923
and make sure it was the most diverse,
and they achieved that.

44:36.006 --> 44:39.093
Political reform is
by far the most impactful.

44:39.843 --> 44:42.388
Take the districts out
of the hands of politicians

44:42.471 --> 44:44.640
and put it into the hands of the voters.

44:44.723 --> 44:48.102
Open up the primaries, so the parties
didn't have a lock on the primary.

44:48.185 --> 44:52.272
It permanently changed how people
are elected to office in California.

44:54.817 --> 44:57.820
Another big difference
between Schwarzenegger and other governors

44:57.903 --> 44:59.988
is how much joy he got from the job,

45:00.072 --> 45:02.908
and that kind of happy warrior approach

45:02.991 --> 45:06.620
has a way of lifting up the staff
and lifting up the state.

45:08.664 --> 45:12.668
Schwarzenegger personifies
what I think is the essence of California.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.753
[inspiring music plays]

45:15.462 --> 45:17.756
[reporter] Arnold Schwarzenegger finishes
his seven-year run

45:17.840 --> 45:19.508
as governor of California today.

45:19.591 --> 45:23.345
[reporter 2] And the question Arnold
watchers are asking now is, what's next?

45:25.556 --> 45:27.599
It was very, very tough

45:28.392 --> 45:29.810
on my marriage,

45:30.644 --> 45:32.563
on my relationship with Maria

45:33.147 --> 45:34.273
and with the kids

45:34.773 --> 45:35.983
when I was governor.

45:37.109 --> 45:39.695
And I also lived in denial

45:40.487 --> 45:43.282
of a lot of the problems that exist.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.953
Maria and I went to counseling

45:48.036 --> 45:49.246
once a week,

45:49.329 --> 45:51.331
and then at one of the sessions

45:51.415 --> 45:52.916
the counselor said,

45:53.000 --> 45:57.129
"I think today Maria wants to go
and be very specific about something."

45:57.212 --> 46:00.424
"She wants to know
if you're the father of Joseph."

46:03.218 --> 46:04.386
And um…

46:06.138 --> 46:09.266
I was like… I thought my heart stopped.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.729
And then I told the truth.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.857
"Um, yes, Maria."

46:18.192 --> 46:19.651
"Joseph is my son."

46:20.652 --> 46:24.031
She was, you know,
obviously crushed because of that.

46:25.491 --> 46:28.035
[reporter] Late last night, Maria Shriver
and Arnold Schwarzenegger

46:28.118 --> 46:30.120
put out a statement
saying they are separating

46:30.204 --> 46:32.664
after 25 years of marriage.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.168
I had an affair

46:36.668 --> 46:38.128
in '96.

46:39.588 --> 46:43.050
In the beginning, I really didn't know.

46:43.133 --> 46:46.762
I just started kind of feeling.

46:47.805 --> 46:48.806
The older he got,

46:48.889 --> 46:52.059
the more it became clear to me,

46:52.643 --> 46:56.605
and it was then
just really a matter of, like,

46:56.688 --> 47:00.275
how do you keep this… quiet?

47:00.359 --> 47:03.237
How do you keep this… a secret?

47:06.657 --> 47:10.035
[Barabak] Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver
had separated.

47:10.118 --> 47:11.578
So a bit of time passes

47:11.662 --> 47:13.789
and I receive a tip

47:13.872 --> 47:16.708
that one of the reasons was the fact that

47:16.792 --> 47:21.255
Arnold Schwarzenegger had had a child
with a member of the household staff.

47:23.423 --> 47:25.259
Didn't have a name, didn't have anything.

47:25.342 --> 47:27.135
Through reporting, we put it together,

47:27.219 --> 47:31.098
and I called the Governor's spokesman
for him, whoever it was

47:31.181 --> 47:35.143
and, you know,
they confirmed the story was true.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.521
The human and the kind thing to do

47:37.604 --> 47:42.609
was to afford him and Maria Shriver
some time to talk to their family.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.736
I had to go

47:46.488 --> 47:47.990
to my kids and…

47:49.324 --> 47:50.951
and explain it to them.

47:51.535 --> 47:54.121
[reporter] Former California governor,
Arnold Schwarzenegger,

47:54.204 --> 47:56.164
has admitted to fathering a child

47:56.248 --> 47:58.458
with a member
of his family's household staff

47:58.542 --> 47:59.960
more than a decade ago.

48:00.043 --> 48:03.380
[reporter 2] The New York Times
reporting tonight, the child is a boy.

48:03.463 --> 48:04.548
He's now 14.

48:04.631 --> 48:07.009
[reporter 3] Baena had worked
for the couple for two decades

48:07.092 --> 48:08.010
as a housekeeper,

48:08.093 --> 48:10.554
and he hid that child for years,
not just from voters,

48:10.637 --> 48:12.222
but from his own family.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.808
How could he keep this secret for so long?

48:19.563 --> 48:22.983
The reason why I feel
reluctant talking about it

48:23.066 --> 48:24.943
is just because

48:25.611 --> 48:26.945
every time I do,

48:28.614 --> 48:30.616
it opens up the wounds again,

48:31.992 --> 48:32.826
and…

48:37.247 --> 48:38.665
and I think that…

48:41.960 --> 48:45.172
that I have caused
enough pain for my family

48:45.255 --> 48:46.798
because of my fuckup.

48:47.507 --> 48:50.010
You know, because of that,
everyone had to suffer.

48:50.510 --> 48:53.055
Maria had to suffer.
The kids had to suffer.

48:54.890 --> 48:56.016
Joseph.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.102
His mother. Everyone.

49:04.232 --> 49:06.902
I am gonna have
to live with it the rest of my life.

49:07.402 --> 49:09.821
I mean, you know, people will remember

49:10.906 --> 49:12.449
my successes

49:13.241 --> 49:15.535
and they will also
remember those failures.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.037
It's a major failure.

49:17.871 --> 49:19.998
I mean, I had failures in the past,

49:20.082 --> 49:22.834
but… you know, in my career,

49:23.627 --> 49:26.463
but I mean, this is
like a whole different ball game.

49:26.546 --> 49:29.549
This is like
a whole different dimension of failure.

49:32.719 --> 49:34.721
[indistinct chatter]

49:47.234 --> 49:52.698
[Arnold] I just saw Joseph
developing into a fantastic human being

49:53.407 --> 49:55.325
and this fantastic man.

49:55.409 --> 49:57.160
He makes me feel proud,

49:57.786 --> 50:00.163
and I feel really good about him.

50:06.545 --> 50:07.546
It was wrong,

50:08.547 --> 50:09.631
what I did,

50:10.382 --> 50:13.760
but I don't want to make Joseph feel
that he's not welcome in this world,

50:13.844 --> 50:16.138
because he's very much
welcome in this world,

50:17.014 --> 50:18.223
and I love him,

50:18.849 --> 50:22.227
and he has turned out
to be an extraordinary young man.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.319
See you, guys.

50:32.362 --> 50:33.238
[man] Have a good day.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.912
[Arnold] I'm very happy

50:40.996 --> 50:43.623
within this sad story

50:44.166 --> 50:45.792
that, um…

50:46.918 --> 50:51.131
that Maria and I were able
to raise the kids really well.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.218
I think
that there's nothing more important

50:55.302 --> 50:57.179
than to have a good partner by your side,

50:57.262 --> 50:59.765
and every step of the way,
Maria was exactly that.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.603
We have a really great relationship.

51:04.686 --> 51:07.272
-Making a mess.
-Making a mess. Exactly.

51:08.356 --> 51:12.069
Any kind of a special day,
we are all together as a family,

51:12.652 --> 51:15.655
and everyone is really happy about that.

51:20.952 --> 51:22.037
But it's not

51:23.455 --> 51:24.664
what it was,

51:24.748 --> 51:27.959
where we were all together
kind of under one roof as a family.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.337
That is not the case anymore.

51:31.171 --> 51:33.256
It's all about the circular motion.

Ah! [laughs]

51:36.134 --> 51:37.886
-Look at this.
-Oh my God.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.389
It's so sick.

51:42.933 --> 51:46.895
[Arnold] My father always said, "As long
as you concentrate on being useful,

51:46.978 --> 51:49.606
rather than, 'How do I feel today?',

51:49.689 --> 51:52.943
it doesn't matter.
It's not gonna help anything anyway."

51:53.026 --> 51:55.112
"So you can feel shitty,
you can feel happy,

51:55.195 --> 51:57.614
the world is not gonna change,
so let's get going."

51:58.115 --> 51:59.032
All right.

52:01.868 --> 52:04.287
It's the routine.
Every day the same thing.

52:04.371 --> 52:06.206
First, I let the animals out.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.207
Fresh cookies.

52:07.290 --> 52:10.168
Then I bang, make a lot of noise.

52:11.461 --> 52:15.632
That means they have to run out
to the tennis court and get the grass.

52:15.715 --> 52:18.844
Now for 15 minutes,
they're gonna eat now grass.

52:18.927 --> 52:20.303
That's all they're gonna have.

52:20.387 --> 52:24.266

52:28.228 --> 52:30.188
I play with them. I clean them off.

52:30.272 --> 52:32.274
I clean the stable. I shovel the shit.

52:33.066 --> 52:37.028
So for an hour and a half,
I cannot think about anything else.

52:37.112 --> 52:38.196
There's a mission.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.075
Now some people
take seminars about this stuff,

52:42.159 --> 52:44.995
how to feel better about yourself
and all this stuff,

52:45.078 --> 52:46.580
but I always tell people,

52:46.663 --> 52:49.457
"Stay busy. Be useful."

52:49.541 --> 52:50.458
All right.

52:50.542 --> 52:52.502
[curious music plays]

53:02.721 --> 53:06.474
I think that I went through this stage

53:06.975 --> 53:09.686
where you kind of lose it.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.938
Where I felt kind of like,

53:12.022 --> 53:15.400
"I'm not going to take off my T-shirt,

53:15.984 --> 53:19.154
because my abs are not quite
anymore what they were."

53:19.237 --> 53:22.866
And you look at your body
and all the sudden you see a wrinkle

53:22.949 --> 53:24.618
below your pectoral muscle.

53:24.701 --> 53:28.038
You look at that
and lift up your arm and say, "What?"

53:28.121 --> 53:30.832
"I wonder if this can be
surgically removed?"

53:33.126 --> 53:34.544
The first drama

53:34.628 --> 53:36.963
I went through
years and years and years ago,

53:37.047 --> 53:39.132
when I says, "You look like shit."

53:39.216 --> 53:41.468
"This is not anymore
the Arnold that I know of."

53:41.551 --> 53:44.346
Now, I don't even look
at that anymore that way.

53:44.429 --> 53:46.473
Now I'm just fighting to hold on.

53:46.556 --> 53:50.310
You're 75 years old
and you look in the mirror and you say,

53:50.393 --> 53:51.519
"What the fuck?"

53:55.232 --> 53:57.525
Well, let's just see
what else we have here.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.488
Now this

54:01.571 --> 54:03.031
is Franco Columbu,

54:03.823 --> 54:08.578
also known as Dr. Franco Columbu
because he was a doctor and chiropractic.

54:09.162 --> 54:12.499
He was my best friend,
and he was my training partner.

54:12.582 --> 54:16.419
There was no one that trained
more hours with me than him.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.546
I met him when I was 18 years old.

54:18.630 --> 54:20.173
He was powerful.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.175
He inspired me to get stronger.

54:22.259 --> 54:25.720
I inspired him to get bigger muscles.
We were really great training partners.

54:29.683 --> 54:32.644
Franco was also a bodybuilding champion,
but because he was short

54:32.727 --> 54:34.646
he did not get the notoriety.

54:35.230 --> 54:38.275
It's always, like, the tall guy
who in the end wins.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.530
So I was very sensitive
about him being left behind.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.407
So when I got into the movie business,

54:45.490 --> 54:49.327
I tried to put him into
as many movies as I could.

54:50.662 --> 54:52.205
We used to live together.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.040
We made wine together.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.126
I helped him build his house.

54:56.668 --> 54:58.378
It's been the greatest,

54:58.461 --> 55:01.631
the closest relationship
that I've had with any guy.

55:08.263 --> 55:09.806
After he passed away,

55:11.182 --> 55:12.350
there's not a day

55:12.434 --> 55:15.979
when I don't go into my living room
and look over at the chessboard.

55:17.522 --> 55:20.150
That's where Franco and I
spent so much time.

55:21.860 --> 55:22.944
I really miss him.

55:23.028 --> 55:25.530
I mean, he was such a wonderful man

55:25.613 --> 55:27.866
and such a good human being.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.663
I wish that everyone

55:34.164 --> 55:35.665
has a friend like that,

55:37.042 --> 55:39.919
because if you don't,
you miss out on a lot.

55:40.003 --> 55:41.254
That's all I can say.

55:44.549 --> 55:46.426
It is a big adjustment

so many of your friends pass away.

is kind of my motivation
and my visualization and all this stuff."

56:56.371 --> 56:58.790
that I would be an actor and all that,

that this would turn into a museum.

Everyone has
their own definition of success.

and see their grandkids,

I was more adventurous,

We're kind of the elder statesmen,
if you want to call it that.

57:56.848 --> 58:00.268
But Arnold has developed
that kind of impervious,

58:00.351 --> 58:01.853
bigger-than-life character.

58:01.936 --> 58:03.771
-Let me do one with the arms out.

[Sylvester]
And I don't think it's gonna stop.

58:06.149 --> 58:08.359
[Wachter] Arnold is Mr. Universe.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.029
He is one of the few, if only, people

58:11.112 --> 58:14.699
who has succeeded
in three completely different realms.

58:14.782 --> 58:17.535
But he never turned his back
on bodybuilding.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.996
He always cared about the sport.

58:20.079 --> 58:22.373
That's why he ran the Arnold Classic.

58:22.457 --> 58:25.710
And acting, he didn't stop making movies.

58:25.793 --> 58:26.753
[man] He looks old.

58:27.462 --> 58:29.088
Never seen a terminator old before.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.966
My auditory circuits
have not degraded, however.

I'm old,

58:34.385 --> 58:35.470
not obsolete.

58:35.553 --> 58:38.264
Arnold wasn't trained
to think in those terms,

58:38.348 --> 58:41.100
but I don't see anything slowing him down.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.477
He loves life.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.938
He loves people.
He loves getting things done,

58:45.021 --> 58:47.857
and as long as he's got a breath,
he's gonna continue doing it.

[Cameron] He's got this huge brand
and this huge fan base.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.366
He's just trying to give back.

58:56.449 --> 58:58.368
-I'm back.
-[applause]

58:58.451 --> 59:03.081
We need the people to put the pressure
on our elected leaders.

59:03.164 --> 59:04.958
[Kennedy] He is an elder statesman now,

59:05.041 --> 59:08.294
and a statesman with global stature.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.172
The world needs him.

59:11.256 --> 59:13.925
You just have to ignore the naysayers,

59:26.938 --> 59:29.732
"Well, Arnold,
you wanted to change things?"

59:29.816 --> 59:32.151
"Now is your time. Now is your chance."

59:35.029 --> 59:36.447
I have a big platform,

59:37.198 --> 59:41.160
so I have to use that power of influence

59:41.911 --> 59:43.079
in a good way.

59:44.038 --> 59:46.541
I'm sending this message
through various different channels

59:46.624 --> 59:49.168
to reach my dear Russian friends

59:49.252 --> 59:51.921
and the Russian soldiers
serving in Ukraine.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.465
I'm speaking to you today,

59:54.549 --> 59:57.260
because there are things
that are going on in the world

59:57.343 --> 59:58.720
that are being kept from you.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:03.933
A lot of the stuff that I talk about,
I have witnessed firsthand.

01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:05.727
For instance,

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.896
the broken man in Austria

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.773
after the Second World War,

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:11.858
when I was born,

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:16.237
and I saw them getting drunk.
I saw them being in pain.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.949
Not only because they lost the war,
but also because they fell

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:22.577
for a horrible, loser ideology.

01:00:23.077 --> 01:00:25.079
They were lied to and misled

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.707
into a path that ended in misery.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.961
So when I see something similar
happening today…

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.423
I mean, I see people marching
with Nazi flags and all this,

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:39.010
I say to myself,
"There's someone that is lying to them

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.386
that this is the way to go."

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:44.057
I knew what that led to.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.725
That led to World War II,

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.935
and it led to the atrocities.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.356
More than six million Jews were killed.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:54.150
Innocent other people
were tortured and killed,

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:56.903
only because these people were lied to.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.113
[clamoring]

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.908
I speak with the same heartfelt concern

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:06.245
when there was an attempted insurrection
on January 6th last year.

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:10.166
There are moments like this
that are so wrong,

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:11.709
and then we have to speak up.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:14.629
I ask you to help me spread the truth.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.758
To me, I don't understand this idea

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.594
of looking at anyone as the enemy,

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:26.307
because I can get together with anyone

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:30.144
and try to figure out
how can we work together.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.733
Don't we all want to be loved,

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:38.736
and therefore,
we should give love back to people?

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:45.076
Over the years, that thought started
coming more and more into my mind…

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.169
that I've had as close to a perfect life

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:56.921
than anyone can have.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:01.259
Then, of course,
you feel like it's too short.
