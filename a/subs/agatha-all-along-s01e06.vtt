- Hey!

00:19.375 --> 00:21.124
- What were you after?
- The Road.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.707
- What road?
- You, of all people, should know.

Again, who are you?

00:39.416 --> 00:40.624
I'm...

00:40.625 --> 00:42.499
Someone's put a sigil on that boy.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.790
A sigil is a redaction spell
that hides something.

00:45.791 --> 00:47.082
Did you put the sigil on me?

00:47.083 --> 00:50.790
Actually, I wouldn't know.
It works on the witch who cast it as well.

00:50.791 --> 00:54.082
Sigils are destroyed
when they're no longer needed.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.207
- [Teen] How old were you?
- Thirteen, maybe.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.708
A lot happened to me at 13, too.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.207
Wake up. Alice. Please wake up.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.707
Don't touch her!

01:02.708 --> 01:05.208
You're so much like your mother.

Oh, good. Perfect.

- [Rebecca] Oh, look at you.
- [Jeff] Eat this.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.333
We are so proud of you.

03:26.166 --> 03:29.875
We love you more than we could ever hope
to communicate in human words.

03:31.583 --> 03:34.082
- Gross.
- Ew, you're gross.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.125
- You're both disgusting.
- [chuckles]

03:36.833 --> 03:40.166
Thank you for everything.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.499

Are we looking behind us, or ahead?

04:28.541 --> 04:29.541
Ahead.

04:31.833 --> 04:32.833
I think.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.291
Yeah, do ahead.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.750
Let us see what the future has in store.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.958
Please. May I have your right palm?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.041
Don't tell me everything.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.583
I don't wanna know too much.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.333
Sorry. I...

04:55.083 --> 04:56.416
Just pretend I'm not here.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.125
It's clear that
a long journey lies ahead of you.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.458
This journey will be
one of great transformation and...

[electricity crackling]

05:13.291 --> 05:14.750
Your lifeline is broken in two.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.541
[Teen] What?

05:17.666 --> 05:18.916
That can't be good.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.750
It can mean many things.

05:24.583 --> 05:28.583
It often represents personal growth
and important life changes.

05:30.041 --> 05:31.041
You're becoming a man.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.791

05:46.208 --> 05:48.500
I thought you were reading my palm.

05:50.875 --> 05:51.875
I'm sorry. I...

05:53.500 --> 05:55.125
I just remembered something, I think.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.625
Okay, well, I probably should...

06:02.833 --> 06:03.833
go back to the party.

06:06.041 --> 06:09.000
Love the vibe in here, though.
It's very early Argento.

06:10.791 --> 06:13.375
You don't need to be a psychic
to see that you're a good egg.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.958
Enjoy the now, baby.

I don't think he's breathing.
I can't get to him.

- William.

- [Rebecca] He's clearly different.

to an excellent psychologist.

- Hey.

This is where you'd say,
"Since when do you call me 'buddy'?"

Would I?

It's fine. Just please don't fight.

- What do you mean?
- We're not fighting.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.666
Everything's okay. We're with you.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.250
Yeah, sorry.

11:19.875 --> 11:23.040
So, the doctor was saying
all the scans look clean.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.875
And there's no signs of permanent damage.

11:25.375 --> 11:31.415
She thinks the amnesia will just take
a little time to resolve on its own.

11:31.416 --> 11:32.500
That's all.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.457
[Jeff] The really good news
is you're cleared to be discharged

11:47.791 --> 11:48.916

Greg, chill out.
It's William. It's just William.

12:39.791 --> 12:44.791
It's probably just the smell
from the hospital or something.

Okay, come here. Come here. Come here.

I don't understand what's happening.

[Jeff] <i>The doctor said no stress</i>

like we're stressing him out.</i>

[Rebecca] <i>What are we supposed to do?</i>

13:08.458 --> 13:10.832
<i>How do we fix this? I just want him back!</i>

13:10.833 --> 13:14.666

<i>- Give me my son!
- Will he be okay?</i>

13:28.708 --> 13:29.875
Stop worrying!

13:36.708 --> 13:37.916
I'm sorry. I just...

13:43.208 --> 13:44.791
Maybe you're right, Mom.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.458
Maybe I just need to see my room.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.375
- How did...
- [Teen] Do you mind if I...

13:54.375 --> 13:55.540
go up alone?

13:55.541 --> 13:57.375
It's no problem. Of course.

14:05.916 --> 14:09.791
Maybe when I come back down,
we can have dinner.

14:11.541 --> 14:12.625
My treat.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.416
[Jeff chuckles]

15:21.625 --> 15:22.750
My name is William Kaplan.

15:27.875 --> 15:28.875
I'm William Kaplan.

15:31.791 --> 15:33.041
I am William Kaplan.

15:52.583 --> 15:53.582
[Teen] I had fun.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.041
And I always have fun with you.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.749
What is this thing?
You always have it with you.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.833
[Teen] It's nothing.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.625
It's a sigil. At least, I...

16:05.916 --> 16:08.915
I think it is.
It's like a puzzle. Sort of.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.333
Puzzle?

16:12.458 --> 16:13.541
Well, have you solved it?

16:14.125 --> 16:15.333
No, it's...

16:16.625 --> 16:17.625
It's impossible.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.916
[Eddie] <i>I'm just gonna say it.</i>

16:34.750 --> 16:35.958
<i>I can't not say it.</i>

16:36.791 --> 16:38.958
<i>I'm just gonna say,
"William Kaplan. I love you."</i>

16:39.875 --> 16:40.875
I...

16:41.666 --> 16:43.916
[chuckles nervously] Sorry. I just...

16:47.333 --> 16:51.082
- I need to tell you something.
- Really? I need to tell you something.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.125
- Yeah, me first.
- Okay.

16:57.750 --> 17:03.540
So this thing happens
when I'm with someone I care a lot about

17:03.541 --> 17:07.916
and they're having intense feelings.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.625
- I already sound like a freak...
- I'm... I'm into it.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.125
The car accident.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.625
I never told you about it, but, uh...

17:24.375 --> 17:25.375
Eddie, I...

17:26.833 --> 17:27.916
I died that night.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.916
And when I came back, I was different.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.500
Something else. Something more.

17:38.208 --> 17:41.625
I'm not William Kaplan.
At least not entirely.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.291
I still don't remember anything
from before the accident.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.666
I just pretended to recover
so my parents wouldn't worry.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.833
But nothing in my life has felt normal
until I met you.

17:54.958 --> 17:57.875
But I want you to know the truth.
I want you to know the real me.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.125
Whoever that is, because...

18:02.708 --> 18:03.708
Because I love you, too.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.041
You love me... too?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.541
- I love you, period.
- [chuckles]

18:14.500 --> 18:15.500
For the first time.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.208
What did you wanna...

18:22.791 --> 18:24.457
So you don't think I'm crazy?

18:24.458 --> 18:27.916
Uh, no, I totally do.
But for completely different reasons.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.416
You're under no obligation
to be this cool.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.999
I do have one question.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.415
Just one?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.833
If you're not William Kaplan,

18:42.583 --> 18:43.583
who are you?

18:47.458 --> 18:50.583
- [Teen] So I've compiled a dossier.
- Of course you have.

18:53.208 --> 18:57.333
And no distractions, please.
I'm gonna need you to hide those arms.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.790
So on the night of the accident,
we were only a few miles from Westview.

19:04.791 --> 19:07.749
At the exact moment we crashed,
that anomaly was collapsing.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.416
That big, red dome thing in the sky.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.040
Exactly.

19:12.041 --> 19:15.333
I thought that turned out to be some
Avengers training exercise gone wrong.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.416
You're so adorably trusting.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.415

who are a little more adventurous,</i>

19:23.416 --> 19:25.790

- What?

19:25.791 --> 19:26.874
Look at her skin.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.165
That level of flawless should be illegal.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.125
<i>...face mask. It's completely safe.</i>

19:31.750 --> 19:32.957
Okay, here.

19:32.958 --> 19:35.249
<i>- Oh, the light!</i>
- [Eddie] All right, so what do you think

19:35.250 --> 19:36.333
this really is then?

19:37.458 --> 19:39.375
- Aliens?
- No.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.750
Look. Here.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.791
See? Those are runes.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.291
This was a spell.

19:47.666 --> 19:48.666
Witchcraft.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.458
People who were there
refuse to talk about it.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.791
But I did find this guy on Reddit.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.666
He used to live there.
I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.875
I'm adorably trusting?

20:06.958 --> 20:10.291
We couldn't have met him
somewhere with lights or people?

20:11.625 --> 20:14.000
- More coffee?
- This is where he suggested.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.500
That's my point.

20:24.541 --> 20:25.915
I think that's him.

20:25.916 --> 20:28.166
[Eddie] In the trench coat
hiding in the shadows? Yeah.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.125
Who doesn't want to get murdered?

20:48.791 --> 20:50.291
Are you CraftCrazy17?

20:51.333 --> 20:54.125
You must be Bohnerrific69.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.415
You can just call me Ralph.
Randall. Call me Randall.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.750
Thanks for coming.
No one else would meet with me.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.291
You're not wearing a wire, are you?

21:08.916 --> 21:10.124
For what?

21:10.125 --> 21:11.582
Don't worry about it. You...

21:11.583 --> 21:15.000
No! See! Look, look.
No wire. No need to frisk.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.041
- [car engine starts]
- Get down!

21:26.333 --> 21:27.666
So what did you want to know?

21:28.250 --> 21:30.041
Just start with what you remember.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.625
I remember everything.

21:35.791 --> 21:41.250
Wanda had the whole town
acting out this weird, sad sitcom plot.

21:42.541 --> 21:43.540
Wanda Maximoff?

21:43.541 --> 21:45.000
You wanna hear this or not, bub?

21:46.458 --> 21:50.333
You couldn't move or talk
or do anything...

21:52.458 --> 21:53.666
anything on your own.

21:55.541 --> 21:59.916
It was like watching yourself on TV
inside your own head.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.750
But you couldn't turn it off.

22:05.666 --> 22:06.708
It was not a good time!

22:08.166 --> 22:10.166
Do you feel like it changed you?

22:11.333 --> 22:14.583
Can you, like, do stuff now?

22:15.791 --> 22:19.208
You mean, like, wake up every hour
in the middle of the night screaming?

22:20.083 --> 22:23.416
No, like, stuff you couldn't do before.

22:25.708 --> 22:27.833
- What are you talkin' about?
- Never mind.

22:30.041 --> 22:31.500
Anything else of note?

22:32.666 --> 22:33.665
Nope.

22:33.666 --> 22:37.666

22:38.708 --> 22:41.124
- What do you know about Agatha Harkness?
- Come on, man!

22:41.125 --> 22:42.915
- Who is she?
- She's an ancient witch

22:42.916 --> 22:44.291
who will eff your shit up.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.165
- Ugh! Gross. What?
- What the hell is that, man?

22:48.166 --> 22:49.250
It's witch repellent!

22:50.166 --> 22:53.915
You fools. I'm outta here. Amateur hour.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.499
Wait, Mr. Bohnerrific! I just wanna talk.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.833
Fine. Fine! You want the full deal?
I'll tell you.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.707
But it'll cost you extra.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.166
No problem.

like the rest of the yahoos in Westview.

23:23.541 --> 23:26.291
My deal was way, way worse.

23:27.791 --> 23:28.791
How?

23:29.958 --> 23:33.291
Agatha hijacked my life!

23:34.750 --> 23:36.083
God damn it!

23:40.000 --> 23:41.125
She called me her husband.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.291
But I was her puppet.

23:46.166 --> 23:47.208
She stole my house,

23:48.291 --> 23:51.250
completely ruined the market value.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.374
And she made me do
these horrible things like,

23:54.375 --> 23:57.916
I held this really nice lady hostage
in my attic.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.250
I was a terrible influence
on Wanda and Vision's kids.

24:05.625 --> 24:06.791
And I poisoned a dog.

24:07.458 --> 24:08.583
Woof.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.541
- Hey!
- Wait, Wanda and Vision have kids?

24:12.208 --> 24:15.625
Had. Past tense. Twins.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.166
What were their names?

24:18.166 --> 24:20.958
Billy and Tommy.

24:22.416 --> 24:23.749
Tommy.

24:23.750 --> 24:24.875
[Ralph] The little speedster

24:26.458 --> 24:27.750
and his mind-reading brother.

24:32.291 --> 24:34.666
Well, what happened to them?

24:35.250 --> 24:37.875
Who knows? I mean, Wanda's dead.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.458
Word on the street is
S.W.O.R.D. used Vision for parts.

24:42.958 --> 24:43.958
And the twins,

24:46.041 --> 24:47.166
they just disappeared.

24:50.250 --> 24:51.707
But you wanna know what I think?

24:51.708 --> 24:53.874
That they got sucked up
into that red bubble thing

24:53.875 --> 24:55.333
like everything else Wanda made.

24:56.791 --> 25:00.208
After that, I cut and run.
Left my entire Blu-ray collection behind.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.416

25:04.375 --> 25:05.624

Wait, Agatha is still in Westview?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
[Ralph] Last I heard,
she was under some kind of spell.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.415
Acting like a normal resident.
Sourdough starters, potlucks, and whatnot.

25:14.416 --> 25:16.499
- So she's harmless?
- Did I say that?

25:16.500 --> 25:17.665
- I did not say that!
- No.

25:17.666 --> 25:18.750
Hey!

25:19.666 --> 25:20.666
Word to the wise,

25:22.333 --> 25:23.666
don't go sniffing around there.

25:24.666 --> 25:27.749
Or you'll end up buried in that yard
with that dog, or worse!

of crazy that lady eats for breakfast.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.625

[Jeff] Oh, man, I made
that pot roast he likes so much.

26:06.083 --> 26:09.416
I even made the potatoes in the air fryer.
They're super crispy.

No. Shut your mouth.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.540
- That's really tight.
- Shut your mouth.

34:24.541 --> 34:25.957
- Where are we going?
- Just walk!

34:25.958 --> 34:27.041
[Teen] Okay!

34:28.041 --> 34:30.291
Come on, I do not wanna go back
in the closet.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.957
- Come again?
- The Witches' Road.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.332
I want you to take me there.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.958
Why do you need The Road?

34:42.541 --> 34:44.083
Power is what I'm missing.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.500
Who are you?

34:52.291 --> 34:53.458
My name is William Kaplan.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.500
Say again.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.458
I'm Billy Maximoff.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.833
[Agatha groans]

35:31.583 --> 35:32.583
[spits]

35:40.333 --> 35:43.000
[grunting]

36:10.166 --> 36:11.166
[yelps]

36:51.458 --> 36:52.958
[Agatha] That was quite a debut.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.958
"A sigil, what's that?

36:59.666 --> 37:01.541
"Power is what I'm missing."

37:03.750 --> 37:06.250
- Hardly.
- Power doesn't interest me.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.458
Keep telling yourself that.

37:12.458 --> 37:13.583
When did you figure it out?

37:14.416 --> 37:16.041
[Agatha] I had a feeling
when we first met.

37:17.250 --> 37:20.458
Even with the sigil in the way,
you and your mother have the same tell.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.708
- Which is?
- Very inconvenient for you.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.750
I wasn't "sure" sure until...

37:35.375 --> 37:36.875
you...

37:37.041 --> 37:39.500
[imitates explosion
and people screaming]

37:42.208 --> 37:43.208
[chuckles]

37:49.041 --> 37:50.416
It's nice to see you again,

37:52.500 --> 37:53.500
Billy.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.083
Billy.

38:07.041 --> 38:08.375
William.

38:10.625 --> 38:11.625
You can hear me now.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.625
Every witch with a beating heart
can hear you now.

38:18.375 --> 38:19.416
Ah.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.083
Lilia and Jen.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.666
Yeah. Well, what you did was...

38:26.833 --> 38:27.875
[groans]

38:30.041 --> 38:31.333
But life goes on.

38:32.083 --> 38:33.250
Yours, anyway.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.166
I mean, I've killed...

38:37.041 --> 38:38.083
Uh...

38:38.375 --> 38:40.333
Uh... [mutters]

38:43.666 --> 38:45.625
[chuckles] My share.

38:46.208 --> 38:47.915
But you don't see it holding me back.

38:47.916 --> 38:49.332
I'm not like you.

38:49.333 --> 38:51.000
Where have I heard that before?

38:54.708 --> 38:55.708
But tell me.

38:57.750 --> 38:58.750
I just gotta know.

39:00.875 --> 39:04.125
Where did you come by
this fresh body you're wearing?

39:07.666 --> 39:09.750
Okay, you don't wanna tell me.
That's fine.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.083
But...

39:13.958 --> 39:17.291
don't you dare feel guilty
about your talent.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.375
You survived

39:21.750 --> 39:24.041
like witches have been doing
for centuries.

39:25.708 --> 39:29.208
You saw an opportunity, an empty vessel,
and you moved in.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.625
So you broke the rules. Big deal.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.708
That's what kept you alive.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.916
That's what makes you special.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.291
It's what makes you a witch.

39:48.333 --> 39:49.583
Now,

39:50.291 --> 39:52.541
- if we're gonna make it to the end...
- "We?"

39:54.625 --> 39:56.291
But I don't need you anymore.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.000
I don't know if I ever did.

40:05.250 --> 40:06.541
[energy warbles]

40:11.541 --> 40:13.291
[cackles]

40:15.333 --> 40:16.333
Whatever.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.250
You know it's there.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.790
I can finish The Road on my own.

40:21.791 --> 40:24.790
Oh, sure, with all that power
you can't control

40:24.791 --> 40:26.499
without throwing a temper tantrum.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.250
- I'll figure it out!
- [Agatha gasps] Hmm.

40:30.708 --> 40:35.833
What does Billy Maximoff want
at the end of The Road?

40:36.791 --> 40:39.250
Big Magick is already in the bag.

40:42.833 --> 40:45.541
Is it "Find Mama?"

40:47.208 --> 40:48.208
No.

40:49.416 --> 40:54.500
She chose a town full of strangers
over her own flesh and wires.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.458
What about Robo-Papa?

41:00.875 --> 41:04.750
Lord knows where he is
or in how many pieces.

41:06.958 --> 41:10.875
So who is left? [clicking tongue]

41:13.291 --> 41:16.416
Oh! Right.

41:17.291 --> 41:19.083
There's two of you.

41:20.708 --> 41:22.624
You're after Toby.

41:22.625 --> 41:23.833
Tommy.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.958
- That's what I said.
- He's out there somewhere.

41:29.041 --> 41:31.708
I can sense him. I just... can't find him.

41:32.708 --> 41:34.500
Gosh, you really are a Maximoff.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.999
Otherwise, none of this would be
nearly as dramatic.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.208
He's my brother.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.083
If you really wanna finish this together,

41:45.458 --> 41:47.250
just know that I do not trust you.

41:49.041 --> 41:50.208
At all.

41:50.750 --> 41:51.750
Ever.

42:01.166 --> 42:02.166
Got it.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.375
Got it.

42:07.083 --> 42:09.041
Let's go find the next trial.

42:10.541 --> 42:12.458
Last one there is a nice person.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.125
I'm not that nice.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
