[Rio] <i>You are trapped
in a distorted spell.</i>

00:21.166 --> 00:22.791
What were you looking for in my house?

00:22.791 --> 00:23.875
The Road.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.583
[chanting in Latin]

00:29.375 --> 00:32.625
- [groans]
- [Rio] <i>Yes. Claw your way out.</i>

00:40.208 --> 00:44.791
How long have I been living
in this cesspool of a town?

00:44.791 --> 00:46.291
About three years.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.041
Wanda.

00:48.041 --> 00:53.541
<i>She took every little bit of power I had
and left me with household appliances.</i>

00:54.208 --> 00:56.250
We gotta get back on top.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.541
If you're real, then that means...

01:04.916 --> 01:06.875
Let me get my purple back.

01:07.958 --> 01:09.333
And then come find me.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.083
I am not the only one
that wants to see you dead.

01:12.083 --> 01:14.458
I expect you'll see them at sundown.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.708
[Agatha] ...more of this nonsense!

01:24.958 --> 01:26.500
[shop door bell dings]

01:26.500 --> 01:29.166
Coming in here after all that time,
thinking she's gonna...

01:29.166 --> 01:30.416
Look at my front door!

01:30.958 --> 01:32.583
- [sighs] What?
- [speaking indistinctly]

01:34.791 --> 01:35.791
Ugh!

01:39.416 --> 01:40.541
Whose shoes are these?

01:43.666 --> 01:46.250
Okay. She's unstoppable.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.958
The house is yours, random boy.

01:49.958 --> 01:52.291
Be sure to tell the vengeance-seekers
I said hi.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.291
Take me to the Witches' Road!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.708
- [grunts]
- Come again?

02:06.708 --> 02:08.125
The Witches' Road.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.333
I want you to take me there.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.166
Please?

02:14.166 --> 02:15.583
The Witches' Road doesn't exist.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.291
- You're lying.
- Am I?

02:17.291 --> 02:20.291
That's just what real witches say
to keep the amateurs out.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.791
The Road will give you
the thing you want the most.

02:23.791 --> 02:25.083
If you make it to the end.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.833
And I can. I will.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.041
Hmm.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.416
The Road is no place for a kid.

02:39.416 --> 02:42.291
- I'm 16!
- Oh, sorry. Teen.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.416
I don't know
where you heard about The Road...

02:44.416 --> 02:47.125
Books, the Ballad, legend, lore...

02:47.125 --> 02:48.541
But it will kill you.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.375
Didn't kill you.

02:51.291 --> 02:52.666
Well, I'm exceptional.

02:52.666 --> 02:54.041
That's my point.

02:54.041 --> 02:58.166
Okay, so, confession,
I know an egregious amount about you.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.000
I've been obsessed

03:00.000 --> 03:02.250
- since I first read up on your Salem days.
- Hmm.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.791
One of my favorite "you" eras.

03:04.375 --> 03:05.375
That's a good one.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.000
That's why I came here last night.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.750
That's why I saved you
from the spell you were under.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.583
No. It was my pleasure.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.666
Hmm. Well...

03:18.041 --> 03:24.875
If you've got the goods to break a spell
cast by the Scarlet Witch, [gasps]

03:26.041 --> 03:27.791
why do you need The Road?

03:31.125 --> 03:34.750
I mean, I've studied, don't get me wrong,

03:36.041 --> 03:37.875
but that can only take you so far.

03:38.958 --> 03:41.458
I wanna blast, to shield, to levitate.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.833
So you want a shortcut?

03:42.833 --> 03:46.541
The Road promises
that what's missing awaits you at its end.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.041
Power is what I'm missing.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.041
Sounds like it's what you're missing, too.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.166
Nope. Too risky. No time.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.375
If you wanna run, fine.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.208
But these people
who are coming tonight sound serious.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.000
You really think you can outrun them
with no magic at all?

04:28.041 --> 04:29.375
Who are you?

04:29.958 --> 04:31.041
My name is... [distorts]

04:43.000 --> 04:44.166
Say again.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.166
I'm... [distorts]

04:49.333 --> 04:51.750
- Interesting.
- What?

04:53.708 --> 04:54.708
I'm driving.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.000
What? Really? Yes!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
All right.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.333
Let's hit The Road.

05:04.833 --> 05:07.041
Okay.

05:09.375 --> 05:13.291
And this is not a car. Okay.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.541
That's all right. Yeah, it's totally fine.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.500
It's okay.
Just move on from this little thing. Oh!

05:21.250 --> 05:24.041
Just what I was looking for. Uh...

05:24.625 --> 05:25.625
You're driving.

05:36.416 --> 05:38.083
Miss Harkness! Miss Harkness!

05:39.791 --> 05:41.791
What do you know about covens?

05:43.166 --> 05:46.333
Just that they're drawn together
by mysterious forces of fate,

05:46.333 --> 05:48.833
and that they're the truest form
of sisterhood and...

05:49.625 --> 05:51.666
Oh, my God. Are you taking me
to meet your coven?

05:52.208 --> 05:54.250
No. Those harpies are dust.

05:54.250 --> 05:57.333
But we do need a coven to access The Road.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.041
Right. Of course, that makes sense.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.791
It is the Witches',
plural possessive, Road.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.666
- I'm over here.
- Oh, are you?

06:40.875 --> 06:43.416
- Am I even going in the right direction...
- Be cool, man.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.458
[♪ phone ringing
"On My Mind" by Blackhand]

06:47.083 --> 06:48.166
Sorry.

06:48.958 --> 06:51.208
- He worries.
- Aw!

06:51.208 --> 06:54.083
So where do we just find a coven?

06:55.250 --> 06:58.333
Wherever you are, a coven there shall be.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.083
That's beautiful.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.958
No. It's definitely not.

07:02.541 --> 07:04.875
But it is the Covenstead Rule.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.791
Within any three-mile radius,

07:08.791 --> 07:13.208
there will be a collection
of witchy-enough people to form a coven.

07:13.791 --> 07:16.375
Can you actually jot that down for me?

07:16.375 --> 07:18.083
There's a pen in the glove compartment.

07:18.958 --> 07:22.375
Oh. Okay. Of course.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.541
- Will this be...
- Yeah.

07:23.541 --> 07:24.625
- Perfect.
- Okay.

07:26.541 --> 07:28.083
- Right.
- Do you want me to take that?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.291
No, it's... I'll remember it.

07:32.458 --> 07:37.875
So, with a Covenstead, it's unlikely
we'll find witches as high-profile as you.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.458
Yeah, there's no such thing, Teen.

07:40.958 --> 07:44.166
You know, but all we need
is a bit of talent.

07:45.291 --> 07:49.333
Even the most down-and-out witches,
when in close proximity with each other,

07:49.833 --> 07:52.041
bring out a magical spark.

07:53.791 --> 07:56.208
- Ah. Stop.
- What?

07:56.208 --> 07:57.791
Here. Now.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.500
[Teen] You think
there's a real witch in there?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.750
We'll see if she knows
the secret handshake.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.166
No.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.833
I feel really optimistic about this.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.208
[woman] Welcome to the curious.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.750
[Southern accent] Good day, madam.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.458
Oh. Thank you so much for seein' us.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.625
We are hopin' for a miracle today.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.666
This is my boy, Beauford.

08:34.666 --> 08:37.958
He doesn't talk much.
He's got social anxiety.

08:38.666 --> 08:42.583
His daddy recently passed,
and we miss him somethin' awful.

08:42.583 --> 08:46.166
And we surely would love
to commune with him today.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.250
But to be quite frank with you,

08:49.208 --> 08:53.541
what is top of mind
is the location of some gold bars

08:53.541 --> 08:56.125
he may or may not have buried
in our backyard.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Please.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.791
Thank you. You're a doll.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.375
- How will you be paying?
- Oh.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.416
- He's got it.
- Debit works.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.166
He always takes care of Mama.

09:12.833 --> 09:15.791
- [chuckles dryly]
- Hurry up, though. Okay?

09:17.125 --> 09:19.458
- Your husband was a proud man.
- Oh.

09:19.458 --> 09:22.125
- Indeed, he was.
- Did he golf?

09:22.125 --> 09:23.208
[gasps]

09:24.208 --> 09:26.208
He died on the 18th hole.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.875
Oh. She's good.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.416
Now, the location of those gold bars?

09:34.833 --> 09:35.875
[chuckles]

09:38.583 --> 09:42.083
[vocalizing]

09:45.166 --> 09:46.250
Brother.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.916
You'll find the gold bars
in an old bowling bag

09:52.458 --> 09:53.666
at the back of his closet.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.166
Yes! That's it.

09:57.166 --> 10:00.166
Thank you. Thank the lady,
would you, please, Beauford?

10:00.666 --> 10:02.000
There's something else.

10:04.666 --> 10:05.666
What is it?

10:06.875 --> 10:08.791
You've been
under the influence of another.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.916
- Someone you hurt.
- Ah!

10:13.375 --> 10:14.916
They took your agency.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.000
For three years.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.875
It's not the first time
your witch kin betrayed you.

10:23.583 --> 10:24.916
But you survive.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.583
In a way few do.

10:28.416 --> 10:31.166
In fact, that's why you're here.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.875
And I am not interested.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.333
- Wait, what?
- Thank you for your purchase.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.541
Your bank statement will say
"Lilia's Leggings,"

10:42.541 --> 10:44.375
but that's just my side hustle.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.000
[sighs in relief]

10:47.333 --> 10:48.333
[regular voice] Lilia.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.458
Oh, you haven't even heard the pitch.

10:52.458 --> 10:53.875
[chuckles] I don't need to.

10:54.958 --> 10:59.041
What witch in her right mind
would join Agatha Harkness' coven?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.166
[gasps]

11:00.166 --> 11:03.041
Not looking for right-minded witches,
as it happens.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.333
[screams]

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Looks like we came to the right place.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- [grunts]

11:15.458 --> 11:19.000
So you're a bit of a kook.
Every witch has their process.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.375
You showed some real skill out there.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.083
I didn't read your fortune.
I read your reputation.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.666
- Oh!
- Witches like you are the reason

11:28.666 --> 11:32.416
people think we poison apples,
and steal children, and eat babies.

11:32.416 --> 11:34.666
- Babies are delicious.
- Ugh!

11:34.666 --> 11:36.916
How old are you? 410? 415?

11:36.916 --> 11:39.958
- How dare you?
- Oh, I apologize.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.875
- You don't look a day under 450.
- Years old?

11:43.791 --> 11:47.041
You get, what, maybe two suckers a day
in here, and 20 bucks later,

11:47.041 --> 11:49.250
you're sitting on a bed
that's also your wall.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.041
Don't you miss the glory days?

11:52.041 --> 11:54.875
When I was chased
out of every village I passed through

11:54.875 --> 11:57.083
for accurately predicting tragedy?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.750
No, I do not. Beat it, Harkness.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.541
I'm gonna walk The Road.

12:11.916 --> 12:13.583
The Road is a death wish.

12:14.708 --> 12:15.708
I survived.

12:16.250 --> 12:19.291
Yeah? Where's your power now?

12:19.875 --> 12:21.125
Time to restock.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.958
I need a Divination Witch.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.666
Are you honestly asking me

12:26.666 --> 12:31.416
to coven up with the single most
infamous witch on this continent?

12:31.416 --> 12:35.375
Oh, please. Name a badder bitch
in South America, or Europe.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.833
Who is this child?

12:36.833 --> 12:38.208
- I'm...
- [Agatha] My pet.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.333
This is my pet. Say hi, pet.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.583
Hi.

12:44.250 --> 12:48.500
You expect me to risk my life
on the Witches' Road,

12:48.500 --> 12:50.375
- and if we're successful...
- When.

12:50.375 --> 12:53.666
If we're successful,
watch you turn around and steal my power?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.166
[Agatha clears throat]

12:57.833 --> 12:58.833
[softly] Excuse me.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.000
[Agatha clears throat]

13:02.291 --> 13:04.125
So, little-known...

13:04.708 --> 13:07.000
No, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's just us.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.708
Little-known fact about my ability...

13:13.541 --> 13:17.875
I can't steal your magic
unless you blast me with it.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.666
So if you show a little self-restraint,

13:23.666 --> 13:25.875
which, let's be honest,
you're gonna need to,

13:27.250 --> 13:30.916
all that power is yours to keep.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.708
I found this on your door.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.583
The path you're currently on
leads nowhere.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.458
- Join me.
- Us.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.666
And return
to your former clairvoyant glory.

13:58.666 --> 13:59.791
If you two stay any longer,

13:59.791 --> 14:01.958
I'm going to have to start
charging you again.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.291
- [kettle whistling]
- [electricity crackling]

14:09.666 --> 14:11.875
- What is happening?
- Witchcraft.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.041
Three of Pentacles.

14:30.208 --> 14:33.166
There. A list of four names.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.625
Looks like you've got your coven.
Leave me out of it.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.708
You're on here.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.041
[Teen scoffs]

14:41.958 --> 14:42.958
What?

14:44.041 --> 14:45.250
Can't say no to you.

14:48.458 --> 14:49.458
Agatha's address.

14:51.708 --> 14:54.500
Be there at 5:00.
Plenty of street parking.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.833
That was amazing.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.000
And we got a team roster
out of the deal, too.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.791
So who's next?

15:07.791 --> 15:09.500
[crow cawing]

15:21.208 --> 15:22.208
Agatha?

15:24.291 --> 15:25.291
What?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.416
Who's next on the list?

15:28.375 --> 15:29.375
Uh...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.083
Ugh!

15:33.208 --> 15:34.208
Taste.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.291
[both chuckle nervously]

15:36.291 --> 15:37.750
I'm being serious, ladies.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.041
Mmm.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.250
Divine, right?

15:43.250 --> 15:45.333
- So good.
- Yum.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.583
I know.

15:46.583 --> 15:51.583
My probiotic candles are perfect for both
ambiance and metabolic regulation.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.708
I am obsessed with these.

15:54.708 --> 15:57.291
Especially because
you do have to burn them before ingestion.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.625
It's an FDA thing.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.166
- But also, mandatory zen time!
- [shop doorbell dings]

16:01.166 --> 16:04.208
Hey! Where do you keep your jade eggs?

16:04.708 --> 16:08.625
I'm fresh out of marbles,
and my pelvic floor is all over the place.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.833
Actually, you gals wanna
go splitsies on one?

16:14.125 --> 16:16.125
Hmm? Anyone? Anyone?

16:16.125 --> 16:18.291
Sisterhood of the traveling Kegels?

16:18.291 --> 16:20.041
- No? No?
- [door opens and closes]

16:20.041 --> 16:21.166
Hi, Jen!

16:21.166 --> 16:24.041
God, Agatha! I haven't seen you

16:24.041 --> 16:26.875
since I made a really pointed effort
to never run into you again.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.833
[laughs sarcastically]

16:28.833 --> 16:31.458
- So good.
- How are you? Awful?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.541
I'm assembling a coven.
I need a Potions guy.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.583
- We're gonna walk The Road.
- [scoffs]

16:37.916 --> 16:38.916
You're serious?

16:40.083 --> 16:42.791
It's a dead end. Literally.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.666
Oh, come on, Jen.

16:46.041 --> 16:49.291
I'm offering you the chance
to finally lift the binding spell

16:49.291 --> 16:53.666
that has kept you magic-less
for the last... What, century?

16:53.666 --> 16:55.708
- You look amazing.
- I know.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.500
- What do you care about my magic?
- I... [grunts]

17:00.458 --> 17:01.833
Oh!

17:02.250 --> 17:04.000
You lost the Darkhold,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.958
and now you're powerless and exposed.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.208
How far you've fallen, witch killer.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.250
At least I'm still a witch.

17:12.125 --> 17:14.791
Like I care about that dusty,
warty, snaggle-toothed community.

17:14.791 --> 17:17.458
Oh, you don't fool me.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.250
You'd chew off your own acrylics
to get back into the club.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.625
Ugh! I'm not gonna waste my breath
illuminating the obvious.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.166
Have fun healing the healthy.

17:25.958 --> 17:28.416
Hi. I love your Insta page, by the way.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.458
You totally minimized
the size of my pores.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.083
Who's this?

17:32.916 --> 17:34.291
Another child sacrifice?

17:35.625 --> 17:38.375
I'm really sorry
about your recent legal troubles.

17:40.666 --> 17:41.875
Yes, I'm aware.

17:41.875 --> 17:46.166
"Fraudulent misrepresentation
resulting in consumer injury."

17:46.166 --> 17:49.458
I personally would not consider
superficial burns "injury,"

17:49.458 --> 17:52.500
but apparently,
some people needed skin grafts.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.541
[Agatha gasps] Oh, Jen!

17:55.541 --> 17:58.125
- I haven't been convicted of anything.
- Yet.

17:58.666 --> 18:01.833
Historically, we as a group
don't do well in courtrooms.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.208
The charge has
a surprisingly lenient penalty,

18:04.208 --> 18:07.291
just, like, payouts
and maybe, like, five years in prison.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.791
- But 800 counts of it?
- [gasps]

18:09.791 --> 18:11.916
[Teen] Starts to get a little life-y!

18:12.500 --> 18:17.250
Wait. So you're magically bound,
and you're about to get literally bound.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.958
None of this pedestrian drama would be
an issue for a powered-up witch.

18:21.958 --> 18:25.875
You think I haven't tried everything
to unbind, you freaky little miscreant?

18:25.875 --> 18:27.125
Hey!

18:27.666 --> 18:29.416
You've tried everything but The Road.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.083
If you value your freedom,

18:32.833 --> 18:34.750
join us here, tonight.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.166
Oh!

18:40.166 --> 18:41.625
Gonna take a jade egg to go.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.000
You'll know where to find it.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.375
[shop doorbell dings]

18:45.958 --> 18:46.958
Thank you.

18:49.583 --> 18:50.833
Two down. Two to go.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.750
- Just one, actually.
- What?

18:52.750 --> 18:54.083
- Yeah.
- Lilia said four names.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.583
- No.
- Let me see. Let me see.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.666
What are you...

18:57.833 --> 18:59.250
- Very mature.
- Come on, Teen.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.708
- Wasting daylight.
- Okay.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.833
- I can't believe you actually ate that.
- Ate what?

19:05.833 --> 19:09.125
Now I'm actually hungry.
I could use a corn dog.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.125
[Teen] Do you see her?
Do you know what she looks like?

19:13.791 --> 19:14.875
She's a Blood Witch.

19:15.375 --> 19:16.875
A Blood Witch is...

19:16.875 --> 19:18.208
Child of a witch.

19:18.208 --> 19:23.708
In this case, her mom was a witch
and also a famous goddess of rock.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.958
Lorna Wu?

19:26.958 --> 19:29.750
- As in Lorna Wu and the Coral Shore?
- Take it easy.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.875
She wrote the most famous version
of the Ballad.

19:31.875 --> 19:35.375
My mom went to see her last tour
right before she died. RIP.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.625
I bid on a limited edition
signed LP of the Ballad,

19:38.625 --> 19:41.625
but it cost more than I make
in a whole summer at the Hokey Pokey Bowl.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.541
I don't wanna ever hear
those words paired together again.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.166
[rat squeaking]

19:57.791 --> 19:59.041
Let's go.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.875
You're just gonna... Fine.

20:05.958 --> 20:09.208
You think we're gonna find
Lorna Wu's daughter at the Westview Mall?

20:09.833 --> 20:14.416
I feel like she'll be somewhere cooler,
like Brooklyn or a yacht.

20:15.041 --> 20:18.250
Rumor has it
Lorna Wu was lost to the Witches' Road.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.458
- What?
- I know. Ironic.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.166
- More like iconic.
- No.

20:25.416 --> 20:28.583
I know I have an aesthetic,
but what are we doing here?

20:29.333 --> 20:30.333
Run.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
- Run?
- Run!

20:34.041 --> 20:36.791
- Whoa!
- [alarm beeping]

20:37.750 --> 20:38.750
Alice Wu Gulliver?

20:39.333 --> 20:41.791
I'm Agatha Harkness.
This is my familiar, Toto.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.791
We need a Protection Witch
to join us on the Witches' Road.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.416
What do you say?

20:46.416 --> 20:48.416
- What?
- [guard] Gulliver!

20:48.416 --> 20:50.375
Sir, this woman just assaulted my nephew!

20:50.375 --> 20:53.208
- Did you just tackle a teenager?
- Yeah, I saw them lift something.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.375
No, he didn't touch anything.
Check his pockets.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.916
- Search me.
- He didn't do anything.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.500
Your old lieutenant convinced me
to give you a shot,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.750
but you've been nothing but bad luck.
You're fired.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.291
What divine intervention is this?

21:05.291 --> 21:08.583
You're out of a job
and we're setting off for The Road today.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.000
- People like you are dangerous.
- Agreed.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.416
- But The Road?
- The Road isn't real.

21:13.416 --> 21:16.125
You groupies don't get it.
It's just a stupid song.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.708
Um, forty million copies worldwide
beg to differ.

21:19.708 --> 21:20.916
The Road is real.

21:20.916 --> 21:22.625
- Agatha's been there.
- And back.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.750
The Road is a myth. It's a con. A cult.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.250
Yeah. But what if it isn't?

21:28.791 --> 21:31.041
What if you could finally
answer the question

21:31.041 --> 21:33.958
that has been haunting you
for most of your life?

21:38.750 --> 21:40.125
"What happened to Mommy?"

21:51.208 --> 21:53.375
- She's a tough nut to smash.
- Crack.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.916
[sighs exasperatedly] I didn't even
get to give her your address.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.250
We don't need her.

22:01.291 --> 22:02.333
Come on.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.208
[boy] Hey!

22:06.458 --> 22:08.208
We've got about an hour until sunset.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.000
- Are you sure two witches are enough?
- [sighs]

22:12.625 --> 22:15.000
How far away is The Road?
Like, what's the drive time?

22:18.083 --> 22:19.083
Where are you from?

22:20.166 --> 22:22.500
Me? Originally? I mean,

22:23.083 --> 22:25.875
I was born and raised in Eastview...
[continues inaudibly]

22:29.125 --> 22:31.583
[snapping audibly]

22:31.583 --> 22:33.916
[continues inaudibly]

22:35.916 --> 22:38.291
[♪ music through radio playing audibly
"There's a Road" by Kinney]

22:39.583 --> 22:41.750
- [radio switches off]
- [continues inaudibly]

22:45.750 --> 22:48.125
[audibly] It's nice to get to know
each other a little bit.

22:53.583 --> 22:54.833
Drive faster.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.583
What? Okay.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.708
[wolf howls]

23:40.208 --> 23:42.500
Don't be nervous. They'll show. I know it.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.333
- Does this look centered?
- Let me see.

23:45.333 --> 23:48.583
Maybe if I just
put it a little more to the...

23:50.125 --> 23:51.708
No, leave it up.

23:52.291 --> 23:54.541
It really elevates the space.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.416
Oh, God, am I the first to arrive?

23:57.416 --> 23:59.041
The rest will be here soon.

23:59.041 --> 24:01.500
Please come in. Right, Agatha?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.583
I don't care.
Yeah, whatever she would like.

24:03.583 --> 24:07.791
Can I interest you
in a pre-Road appetizer?

24:08.416 --> 24:11.875
They are old granola bars.
I didn't have much to work with.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.166
I ate before I came.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.500
I don't mind a lapsed expiration date.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.208
High priestess.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.708
Jennifer Kale, Potions.

24:21.708 --> 24:23.458
Lilia Calderu, Divination.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.125
- You're bound.
- And you need a chemical peel.

24:28.750 --> 24:29.958
[Alice] This is never gonna work.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.083
- Your front door is missing.
- Alice!

24:33.083 --> 24:34.791
- How did you...
- I'm an ex-cop.

24:34.791 --> 24:36.875
That's gonna be the answer
to a lot of questions.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.166
Well, gang's all here. Let's hit The Road.

24:40.166 --> 24:42.583
Wait. Where's our Green Witch?

24:43.416 --> 24:46.541
- Oh, do we really need one of those?
- Of course we do.

24:46.541 --> 24:49.208
- Says who?
- The Ballad.

24:49.208 --> 24:52.791
-"Wake thy power, earthly and divine."
- No, I've heard it.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.958
Earth magic is arguably
the most important skill set

24:55.958 --> 24:57.458
for an attempt at The Road.

24:58.041 --> 24:59.458
Getting cold feet already, Jen?

25:00.541 --> 25:03.416
Well, there was one more name
on the coven list.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.083
Wasn't there?

25:07.458 --> 25:09.958
- Lilia's handwriting is so bad...
- What was the last name?

25:12.208 --> 25:14.333
It wasn't a name. It was a heart.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.250
A heart?

25:18.333 --> 25:19.625
A black heart.

25:20.666 --> 25:23.791
That's because you used a black pen.
[chuckles]

25:28.166 --> 25:29.416
Oh!

25:30.291 --> 25:31.500
I know who it is.

25:32.416 --> 25:33.666
I'll just go get her.

25:34.541 --> 25:35.791
Be back in a flash.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.416
Yoo-hoo!

25:51.708 --> 25:52.958
Agnes?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.875
Well, you look fabulous!

25:56.875 --> 25:59.875
- Thank you, Mrs. Hart.
- No, no, no.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.041
- It's Mrs. Davis, dear. No.
- Oh, right.

26:03.041 --> 26:07.416
Mrs. Hart was what Wanda branded me,

26:07.416 --> 26:08.833
- you know.
- [shushes]

26:08.833 --> 26:10.375
My name is Sharon.

26:10.375 --> 26:13.958
I know you get confused sometimes
but my real name is Sharon.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.000
Right. Well, there's no time for details.

26:16.791 --> 26:20.166
Oh, have I commented
on how beautiful your garden is recently?

26:20.166 --> 26:22.666
Well, no, you have not.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.666
- [both laugh]
- It's just me and my green thumb.

26:26.291 --> 26:29.000
But I'll tell you the secret
to fluffy azaleas.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.166
So, I was just wondering

26:30.166 --> 26:32.875
if you'd like to come
to a little party I'm having tonight.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.208
A party? [gasps] Really?

26:35.208 --> 26:36.750
- Yeah!
- I haven't been to a party

26:36.750 --> 26:39.416
- since Mr. Davis passed away...
- Are you in or you out, Hart?

26:39.416 --> 26:43.500
Oh, well, I think I'm just...
I'm gonna grab my purse.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.875
Oh, a party!

26:47.791 --> 26:48.958
Should I get the car?

26:48.958 --> 26:50.916
Some people might need
to squeeze in the back.

26:52.208 --> 26:56.625
You don't drive to The Road, Teen.
The Road is conjured.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.458
Oh.

26:58.458 --> 27:00.708
So, um, are we doing laundry together?

27:00.708 --> 27:03.541
Why don't you head upstairs
and let us just do our thing, okay?

27:03.541 --> 27:06.583
Close some windows while you're at it,
'cause it feels a little drafty.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.500
- Okay, but you'll let me know...
- Yep. Yeah. Scoot. Scoot.

27:12.416 --> 27:16.041
Okay. Okay. Okay.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.833
So, all we need to do is sing the Ballad,
