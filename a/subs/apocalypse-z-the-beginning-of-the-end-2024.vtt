00:49.625 --> 00:52.165
Run, I'm going to catch you.
No, don't go in there.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.415
Your mother is going to kill us.
Come on, drop it.

00:54.416 --> 00:57.665
- I'm going to catch you!
- I don't want to go to sleep.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.457
Hey! Come on, to bed now.

00:59.458 --> 01:02.165
The Three Kings are going to come
and catch you still awake.

01:02.166 --> 01:03.832
No, I'm not sleepy.

01:03.833 --> 01:06.250
Yes! Buddy,
your aunt and I have to go home.

01:06.958 --> 01:08.250
Good night.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.958
Uncle, can I see Lúculo?

01:13.333 --> 01:15.790
- All right, but only for a minute, okay?
- Okay.

01:15.791 --> 01:17.833
Come on, and then go to sleep.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.958
Look here, press the button to call him.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.708
Lúculo! Lúculo!

01:26.416 --> 01:28.833
Look, he's coming to see you...

01:29.000 --> 01:30.957
Do you see him? Here?

01:30.958 --> 01:32.249
Can I feed him?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.625
Do you want him
to swell up like a balloon?

01:34.750 --> 01:37.583
To not be able to move,
to get chubby like you?

01:37.708 --> 01:39.499
- I'm not chubby.
- Aren't you?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.665
He'll never be able to move again.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.625
Come on, off to bed,
before your mother gets back.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.541
Come on, Uncle! Five more minutes!

01:47.625 --> 01:49.165
I'll wait up for you.

01:49.166 --> 01:52.708
As long as you're here tomorrow
to open the presents.

01:53.416 --> 01:54.791
Little brother...

02:02.125 --> 02:05.583
It was difficult, but it looks like
he's finally asleep.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.582
In two hours, he'll be in my room,

02:07.583 --> 02:10.458
asking me if the Three Kings have come,
you'll see.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.208
You're sure you don't want
to stay a little longer?

02:14.416 --> 02:17.375
No, no, no, no, no.
Better get home before traffic gets bad.

02:17.916 --> 02:21.332
Sorry you didn't get to see Mario.
He's still at the station.

02:21.333 --> 02:24.666
It's okay. Tell him
he's still my favorite brother-in-law.

02:24.791 --> 02:25.625
All right.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.500
- Okay, guys. Thanks for coming. Bye.
- All right. Bye Belén.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.041
Bye.

02:31.208 --> 02:32.040
We'll talk, okay?

02:32.041 --> 02:33.749
- Okay, I love you.
- I love you, too.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.458
- Be careful, okay?
- Yes.

03:02.666 --> 03:03.958
Are you going to tell me?

03:05.083 --> 03:07.958
- Júlia?
- You know what's wrong.

03:09.416 --> 03:10.500
Stop it.

03:11.541 --> 03:15.083
- This isn't the right time.
- When is the right time?

03:17.083 --> 03:20.124
If you don't want kids, just tell me.
Stop messing with me, please.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.749
Júlia, please.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.499
I'm tired of feeling like
you're stringing me along, my love.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.875
You tell me you don't know
if you're going to be a good father.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.125
That I won't be able to handle it.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.291
- You keep giving excuses...
- Watch out!

03:43.500 --> 03:44.750
Are you okay?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.666
Yeah, yeah. You?

04:15.250 --> 04:19.666
ONE YEAR LATER...

04:33.541 --> 04:36.582
<i>So, we continue to await the result</i>

04:36.583 --> 04:39.290
<i>of the special meeting
of the Council of the European Union</i>

04:39.291 --> 04:42.290
<i>where the possibility of border closures
is being debated.</i>

04:42.291 --> 04:44.290
<i>I'm not sure how you all view the issue.</i>

04:44.291 --> 04:47.708
<i>We should be prudent and wait
to see what the experts say.</i>

04:47.833 --> 04:49.082
<i>Excuse me for a second,</i>

04:49.083 --> 04:51.790
<i>because we are connecting with
Daniel Romero...</i>

04:51.791 --> 04:54.165
THE TSJ VIRUS SPREADS:
EUROPE CLOSES BORDERS WITH RUSSIA

04:54.166 --> 04:56.415
<i>...security expert. He's advising the EU,</i>

04:56.416 --> 05:00.582
<i>specifically, the Directorate-General
for Safety and Public Health.</i>

05:00.583 --> 05:05.207
<i>Good morning, Daniel. A complicated day
in Brussels today, I understand?</i>

05:05.208 --> 05:08.582
<i>Good morning, Antonio.
Well, yes, very, very difficult days.</i>

05:08.583 --> 05:13.999
<i>For hours, we've been receiving
very difficult images from the borders.</i>

05:14.000 --> 05:15.707
<i>You've all seen them.</i>

05:15.708 --> 05:19.082
<i>There are rumors that they intend to adopt
a border closure policy</i>

05:19.083 --> 05:22.665
<i>similar to the one currently
being debated in the European Union.</i>

05:22.666 --> 05:27.665
<i>How likely is it that we'll see
border closures globally?</i>

05:27.666 --> 05:29.124
<i>Very likely.</i>

05:29.125 --> 05:33.540
<i>We're seeing that the incidence of
the TSJ virus is absolutely devastating,</i>

05:33.541 --> 05:37.415
<i>with a total failure of
prevention measures so far.</i>

05:37.416 --> 05:39.790
<i>Considering what we saw
during the Covid-19 pandemic,</i>

05:39.791 --> 05:42.665
<i>I believe we're only a few days away
from more drastic measures.</i>

05:42.666 --> 05:45.458
<i>Guidelines are being considered for...</i>

06:05.416 --> 06:07.665
<i>Deputy González Escalón,
welcome to the program.</i>

06:07.666 --> 06:08.749
Thank you.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.624
<i>You can probably guess
my first question,</i>

06:10.625 --> 06:13.707
<i>why does your party distance itself
from the bioweapon theory?</i>

06:13.708 --> 06:15.332
<i>We don't understand why</i>

06:15.333 --> 06:17.915
<i>the natural origin theory
has been revived so quickly.</i>

06:17.916 --> 06:21.749
<i>So, I understand that you don't believe
the United Nations report...</i>

06:21.750 --> 06:23.290
WELCOME TO THE BEGINNING
OF THE END

06:23.291 --> 06:27.165
<i>...that places the origin in
abandoned labs from the Soviet Union.</i>

06:27.166 --> 06:29.374
<i>That report has
a number of glaring errors.</i>

06:29.375 --> 06:30.957
<i>Errors, like...</i>

06:30.958 --> 06:34.208
<i>Okay, well, for example, it talks
about three abandoned laboratories...</i>

06:38.375 --> 06:40.582
- Combarro.
- What?

06:40.583 --> 06:42.915
- Combarro.
- I think it's him.

06:42.916 --> 06:45.582
You're selling the Corinto?

06:45.583 --> 06:47.790
Pleasure to meet you. This is María.

06:47.791 --> 06:48.790
Pleasure to meet you.

06:48.791 --> 06:49.707
Hi.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.958
Where's the boat?
Can't wait to see it.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.250
- Right over here.
- Here?

06:54.875 --> 06:58.207
I think everything was in the ad.
It's nine meters long,

06:58.208 --> 07:00.415
the engine has
a little over 2000 hours on it,

07:00.416 --> 07:03.165
but it's up to date with servicing.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.957
FOR SALE

07:04.958 --> 07:06.208
Yeah?

07:07.833 --> 07:12.291
The sails haven't been used in a year,
but they're in perfect condition.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.041
Thank you.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.208
Thank you.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.750
Do you have any invoices?

07:21.125 --> 07:22.583
Yes, I think so.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.541
Check it out, inside it has...

07:45.750 --> 07:48.249
Does it or does it not suit me perfectly?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.749
It doesn't suit you.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.832
- What do you mean? Look at me.
- No, I don't like it.

07:52.833 --> 07:56.208
- But it's exactly my size.
- Actually, I want to take it off.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.582
Love... I'm stuck!

08:00.583 --> 08:03.999
- It's my favorite bracelet. Careful.
- Okay, okay, don't worry.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.125
- Don't worry.
- Okay. Now.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.500
- I'm sorry.
- No, you broke it.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.624
You broke it, handsome.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.040
I'm sorry.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.083
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry...</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:37.832
<i>Dear customers, we are opening
two additional cash registers.</i>

<i>In order to facilitate your shopping,

08:53.208 --> 08:56.874
<i>Dear customers,
we are working to restock all shelves</i>

08:56.875 --> 08:58.290
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

08:58.291 --> 09:01.624
<i>We remind you that the government
recommends that you not purchase</i>

09:01.625 --> 09:04.958
<i>more than two unit of each product.
Thank you very much.</i>

09:12.416 --> 09:14.041
<i>Good evening to you all.</i>

09:14.166 --> 09:17.207
<i>To explain the situation we're facing,</i>

09:17.208 --> 09:20.332
<i>joining me is the head of the Ministry
of Health, Fernando Aguirre.</i>

09:20.333 --> 09:22.290
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

09:22.291 --> 09:25.750
<i>First of all,
we wanted to inform you that yesterday,</i>

09:25.875 --> 09:29.833
<i>the government of La Rioja
contained two cases in the town of Haro.</i>

09:31.041 --> 09:33.790
<i>Also, the government
of the Balearic Islands has informed us</i>

09:33.791 --> 09:35.915
<i>that no cases have been registered</i>

09:35.916 --> 09:40.416
<i>since the incidents at Cala Ratjada
and Inca, both in Mallorca.</i>

09:40.541 --> 09:41.957
Come here. Easy, relax.

09:41.958 --> 09:44.208
<i>These two news items tell us
that right now,</i>

09:44.333 --> 09:47.166
<i>all cases are controlled in Spain,</i>

09:47.625 --> 09:50.791
<i>which is to say,
we are containing the disease.</i>

10:12.166 --> 10:13.750
<i>Lúculo! Lúculo!</i>

10:14.208 --> 10:15.207
<i>Where's Lúculo?</i>

10:15.208 --> 10:18.250
<i>Please leave Lúculo alone.
I have to talk to your uncle.</i>

10:18.375 --> 10:20.040
<i>Mario, please. Take him.</i>

10:20.041 --> 10:21.707
<i>- Go on.
- I want to see Lúculo.</i>

10:21.708 --> 10:24.707
<i>- Let's go.
- Not, but I want to see Lúculo.</i>

10:24.708 --> 10:26.958
<i>- Where's Lúculo?
- There we go.</i>

10:27.583 --> 10:29.957
- What's up?
<i>- I called you a bunch of times.</i>

10:29.958 --> 10:32.665
I was showing the boat to a couple.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.541
<i>Tell me you sold it
and they paid a lot of money.</i>

10:36.791 --> 10:39.416
They were looking for something
a little more modern.

10:42.416 --> 10:46.541
<i>Listen. I have a proposition, okay?
Just a moment.</i>

10:52.125 --> 10:54.499
<i>This morning they called Mario.</i>

10:54.500 --> 10:56.540
<i>They're transferring us
to the Canary Islands</i>

10:56.541 --> 10:58.124
<i>while all this is going on.</i>

10:58.125 --> 11:01.082
<i>He thinks it's to check
information systems,</i>

11:01.083 --> 11:02.999
<i>but they haven't told him anything more.</i>

11:03.000 --> 11:04.208
And when do you leave?

11:04.875 --> 11:06.874
<i>Well, tonight.</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:08.750
And they notified you today?

11:09.291 --> 11:11.540
<i>Listen. Why don't you come with us?</i>

11:11.541 --> 11:16.374
<i>- They're giving us a house.</i>
- I can't. I'm sorry, Belén.

11:16.375 --> 11:20.208
<i>Yes, you can. I checked.
There's a flight tomorrow from Vigo.</i>

11:22.833 --> 11:26.541
<i>- You're not going to be left alone.</i>
- No, I'll be okay.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.665
<i>Come for a few days at least, okay?</i>

11:29.666 --> 11:32.999
<i>Wait for everything to calm down
and then if you want to go back,</i>

11:33.000 --> 11:35.374
<i>- you can grab--</i>
- Belén, please, don't insist.

11:35.375 --> 11:38.082
<i>Imagine we're confined,
like with COVID,</i>

11:38.083 --> 11:40.250
<i>and you're there alone, stranded...</i>

11:41.166 --> 11:42.791
Well, I'm with Lúculo.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.958
<i>Okay. Do it for me.</i>

11:47.041 --> 11:48.916
<i>Do it for me, please.</i>

12:15.916 --> 12:18.541
Come on.
It's only going to be a few days.

<i>the emergence of a new variant

<i>which has put European authorities

12:39.166 --> 12:41.790
<i>This mutation,
still without an official name,</i>

12:41.791 --> 12:44.165
<i>seems to redefine what we know
about the virus.</i>

12:44.166 --> 12:48.249
<i>It drastically shortens the
incubation period to only a few minutes</i>

12:48.250 --> 12:51.707

15:20.875 --> 15:24.250
Sir, return to your place.
Sir, return to your place.

15:24.375 --> 15:27.000
I want to get onto that plane! Let me go!

15:27.916 --> 15:29.416
Security!

15:38.625 --> 15:41.499
- Yeah?
<i>- Listen, they're closing the airspace.</i>

15:41.500 --> 15:43.249
Yeah, they're announcing it now.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.082
<i>There's a variant
with a few minutes' incubation.</i>

15:46.083 --> 15:49.624
<i>Go home and lock yourself in
until we know more, okay?</i>

15:49.625 --> 15:50.875
Okay.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.833
- Clear out! Let's go!
- Clear out!

15:56.250 --> 15:58.833
Freeze! Drop the weapon!

16:00.875 --> 16:02.750
Drop the weapon! Now!

16:08.250 --> 16:11.832
<i>News of the state of emergency
has be accompanied by incidents</i>

16:11.833 --> 16:15.040
<i>like the one at Vigo Airport
where a man has been arrested</i>

16:15.041 --> 16:17.999
<i>after stealing a gun and
threatening security personnel,</i>

16:18.000 --> 16:21.624
<i>as well as the disturbances we've been
seeing in various locations.</i>

16:21.625 --> 16:24.707
<i>Meanwhile, we continue to wait
for the president's appearance,</i>

16:24.708 --> 16:26.415
<i>where it is expected he will explain</i>

16:26.416 --> 16:29.332
<i>whether the sudden declaration of
a state of emergency</i>

16:29.333 --> 16:33.582
<i>is related to the possible occurrence
of the new variant in Spain,</i>

16:33.583 --> 16:36.332
<i>and whether there will be
any last-minute directive...</i>

16:36.333 --> 16:37.790
6,4 KM TO PONTEVEDRA

16:37.791 --> 16:40.749
<i>...regarding the restriction of movement
due to the new situation.</i>

16:40.750 --> 16:42.249
<i>We return now to Galicia,</i>

16:42.250 --> 16:46.125
<i>where the regional government's Department
of Infrastructure and Transportation</i>

16:46.250 --> 16:49.457
<i>reports heavy traffic
on all road networks.</i>

16:49.458 --> 16:52.791
<i>The Ferrol-Villalba Highway may be
experiencing a backup</i>

16:52.916 --> 16:56.333
<i>of several kilometers as it passes
through Puentes de García Rodríguez.</i>

16:56.458 --> 16:59.957
<i>Indeed, all highways are showing
significant backups.</i>

16:59.958 --> 17:02.541
<i>We recommend finding alternatives
for your travels.</i>

17:03.333 --> 17:05.499
<i>24/7 News, Galicia.</i>

17:05.500 --> 17:10.249
<i>Concern among the residents of Santiago
over the soldiers who deserted...</i>

17:10.250 --> 17:12.625
Hey, do you need something?

17:14.500 --> 17:18.291
We have to get to Chantada.
My husband's family is there.

17:19.250 --> 17:23.165
Well, honestly,
I think the best thing is to turn around.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.500
What?

17:24.666 --> 17:27.416
The best thing is to turn around
while you can.

17:27.875 --> 17:30.291
Because we're not going to be able
to continue this way.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.332
- Okay. Thanks.
- Thanks.

17:32.333 --> 17:36.165
<i>...tried to take by force
a Maritime Rescue vessel</i>

17:36.166 --> 17:38.749
<i>that was providing them food and water.</i>

17:38.750 --> 17:41.999
<i>To these various disturbances
we have to now add</i>

17:42.000 --> 17:44.582
<i>a group of protesters
who attacked a truck</i>

17:44.583 --> 17:47.040
<i>bound for Zaragoza Air Base,</i>

17:47.041 --> 17:50.457
<i>believing that military personnel
were being evacuated.</i>

17:50.458 --> 17:55.124
<i>We are connected with our correspondent
in Aragon for more on this.</i>

17:55.125 --> 17:58.000
<i>Judit, have you been able to find
any more information</i>

17:58.125 --> 18:00.499
<i>about this attack outside the base?</i>

18:00.500 --> 18:04.374
<i>Good Morning, Saúl.
We've learned that two Air Force officers</i>

18:04.375 --> 18:07.000
<i>have been hospitalized
after the attack...</i>

18:21.208 --> 18:22.500
Let's go home.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.708
- Stand back, please.
- But how can we stand back?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.083
- What's going on? Tell us something.
- Back, back.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.040
- Sir? Move away.
- Can you tell me what's going on?

19:21.041 --> 19:22.291
Move away, please.

19:23.041 --> 19:26.041
Spread out. Clear the area. Go.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.625
- Attention!
- Careful! Careful!

19:33.666 --> 19:36.250
- What's going on?
- Please. Please, it's my...

19:36.500 --> 19:38.875
We'll proceed to...
Clear everything.

19:47.958 --> 19:51.250
- My love! Please! No!
- Keep walking, please. Disperse!

19:51.416 --> 19:53.540
Disperse! Out!
There's nothing to see here, folks!

19:53.541 --> 19:55.000
It's Joaquín Teban!

20:51.458 --> 20:55.958
...serious condition.
We're asking for help with the delay.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.958
BELÉN - ANSWER

21:13.500 --> 21:14.665
Hello.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.208
<i>How are you?</i>

21:17.166 --> 21:19.041
<i>Did you take something to calm down?</i>

21:22.541 --> 21:25.458
Have they told you
when they're going to open the airspace?

21:27.083 --> 21:31.458
<i>Well, it's just that with the new variant,
there are no plans for the short term.</i>

21:32.750 --> 21:34.832
<i>Look, listen, this is important.</i>

21:34.833 --> 21:38.583
<i>They're organizing safe zones
to redistribute the population.</i>

21:39.750 --> 21:41.124
They want to move us?

21:41.125 --> 21:44.957
<i>Yes, well, they want to set up
quarantine zones to control the virus.</i>

21:44.958 --> 21:48.000
<i>But, there are critical voices
inside the army.</i>

21:49.583 --> 21:53.166
<i>The greater the number of people,
the greater the number of infections.</i>

21:53.875 --> 21:56.208
<i>And things have happened in Belgium.</i>

21:56.708 --> 21:59.875
<i>So, no matter what, stay at home.</i>

22:00.500 --> 22:03.333
<i>Understand?
No matter what.</i>

22:04.625 --> 22:07.790
<i>- Hey, do you promise me that?</i>
- Yes, of course. I promise.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.249
<i>Keep me posted.</i>

22:09.250 --> 22:13.000
<i>Mario is on alert and he's bringing you
with us as soon as he can.</i>

22:14.583 --> 22:16.583
<i>- I love you very much.</i>
- I love you, too.

22:22.416 --> 22:24.374
<i>Good morning. The latest news.</i>

22:24.375 --> 22:27.207
<i>Germany declares a quarantine in Munich.</i>

22:27.208 --> 22:30.499
<i>As of a few hours ago,
It is forbidden to enter or leave</i>

22:30.500 --> 22:33.832
<i>the 11th most populated city
in the EU.</i>

22:33.833 --> 22:37.999
<i>Not the first city of the continent
that has been confined, but the biggest</i>

22:38.000 --> 22:39.624
<i>in which there is a total closure.</i>

22:39.625 --> 22:45.040
<i>In fact, it is still not known
how the government is reacting.</i>

22:45.041 --> 22:47.374
<i>Oh, my God! What's he doing?</i>

22:47.375 --> 22:49.374
<i>Is he eating it? It's...</i>

22:49.375 --> 22:51.082
<i>Should we help him or what?</i>

22:51.083 --> 22:53.083
<i>What should we do, help him? Oh fuck.</i>

22:56.375 --> 22:59.791
<i>...areas of the federal state of Bavaria
will be evaluated every eight hours.</i>

23:03.125 --> 23:05.999
<i>You can use things like this as armor.
Durable.</i>

23:06.000 --> 23:08.582
<i>If they come to bite, they bite here.
They're fucked.</i>

23:08.583 --> 23:10.458
<i>See? Foolproof.</i>

23:11.291 --> 23:14.874
<i>What? Over here? Over here?
Where are they going to get in? Okay?</i>

23:14.875 --> 23:16.958
STATE OF EMERGENCY

23:25.375 --> 23:27.790
A State of Emergency is declared
in all national territory

23:27.791 --> 23:30.832
due to special circumstances
in order to preserve order and integrity.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.790
Measures and restrictions
will be implemented:

23:32.791 --> 23:34.874
FROM 2:00PM ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY
IS SUSPENDED.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.332
THE POPULATION MAY BE MILITARIZED

23:36.333 --> 23:38.000
Comply with authority
for your safety.

23:43.708 --> 23:46.332
I don't know, I don't know.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.249
No, I don't know what's happening.
Let's go.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.915
- Run, I think someone's coming.
- Run.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.625
- Open the car.
- Let's go.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.458
What's wrong with you, crazy?
You're crazy, dude!

24:22.833 --> 24:24.125
Let's get out of here!

25:09.625 --> 25:11.291
Help!

25:18.375 --> 25:21.166
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:21.541 --> 25:26.749
Help! Help! Help! Help!

25:26.750 --> 25:28.541
Come on, fucker.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.708
Help!

25:41.708 --> 25:42.916
No, no, no.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.707
- Are you okay?
- Don't come any closer.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.000
Don't come any closer.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.207
<i>Good evening.</i>

26:16.208 --> 26:19.665
<i>Apologies for the late hour
at which the cabinet meeting ended.</i>

26:19.666 --> 26:21.915
<i>I am appearing before you very briefly</i>

26:21.916 --> 26:24.207
<i>because in half an hour
we'll be meeting again</i>

26:24.208 --> 26:27.082
<i>again to continue coordinating efforts
with our European partners.</i>

26:27.083 --> 26:32.000
<i>As of today, the incidence rate of TSJ
is out of control across the globe,</i>

26:32.583 --> 26:34.249
<i>and Spain is no exception.</i>

26:34.250 --> 26:38.207
<i>Yesterday at 8:00 pm, my government
ordered the temporary evacuation</i>

26:38.208 --> 26:41.540
<i>of several population centers
on the Mediterranean coast of Spain</i>

26:41.541 --> 26:44.790
<i>and extended the lockdown</i>

26:44.791 --> 26:47.791
<i>of cities with more than
400,000 inhabitants.</i>

26:48.041 --> 26:52.291
<i>The remaining population centers
will be moved to safe zones.</i>

26:53.375 --> 26:57.290
<i>To this end, citizens must follow
the guidelines</i>

26:57.291 --> 26:59.457
<i>issued by the regional control units</i>

26:59.458 --> 27:03.332
<i>and the security forces
acting under their authority.</i>

27:03.333 --> 27:06.374
<i>All citizens are reminded
to comply...</i>

27:06.375 --> 27:07.499
EVACUATION
VEHICLE

27:07.500 --> 27:08.833
<i>...with their orders.</i>

27:08.958 --> 27:12.499
<i>Failure to do so will result
in criminal consequences</i>

27:12.500 --> 27:14.291
<i>once normalcy is restored.</i>

27:15.750 --> 27:19.290
<i>As a matter of fact, from the temporary
command center</i>

27:19.291 --> 27:21.415
<i>at La Graciosa in the Canary Islands,</i>

27:21.416 --> 27:24.957
<i>we'd like to pay tribute
to the hundreds of men and women</i>

27:24.958 --> 27:27.874
<i>of law enforcement
who are giving their lives</i>

27:27.875 --> 27:31.332
<i>to save as many citizens as possible.</i>

27:31.333 --> 27:36.916
<i>You have the respect of the Crown,
the government and the country.</i>

27:38.333 --> 27:39.582
<i>And lastly,</i>

27:39.583 --> 27:43.082
<i>the CECOP has stated
that given the lack of maintenance</i>

27:43.083 --> 27:47.540
<i>and as a failure prevention
of the usual means of communication,</i>

27:47.541 --> 27:53.625
<i>communications will be made
only on the emergency radio network.</i>

27:54.750 --> 27:56.208
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

28:06.041 --> 28:09.915
<i>Prepare to be evacuated
to the nearest safe zone.</i>

28:09.916 --> 28:13.790
<i>You will remain there
until the health emergency is over.</i>

28:13.791 --> 28:17.958
<i>Refusal to evacuate will be considered
a violation of National Security Law.</i>

28:18.166 --> 28:19.833
Please, please.

28:19.958 --> 28:22.416
Go up, please.

28:22.583 --> 28:24.207
I don't know, ma'am. Please.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.958
- Ma'am, you can't lock the car. Ma'am...
- Shut up.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.416
<i>Prepare to be evacuated
to the nearest safe zone.</i>

28:36.333 --> 28:39.708
Don't get on that bus
Please, stay in the house

28:43.750 --> 28:45.208
We'll come find you
soon

28:56.625 --> 28:58.708
Stop already. Enough, please.

28:59.625 --> 29:02.041
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.540
This is the Army speaking.
We must evacuate.

29:30.541 --> 29:31.749
Shut up!

29:31.750 --> 29:33.916
We know you're there! Come out!

29:39.333 --> 29:42.583
We have orders
to evacuate the area immediately.

29:44.291 --> 29:45.875
Open the door!

29:48.291 --> 29:49.958
Come on! We're going to come in!

29:53.166 --> 29:54.832
We can't waste any more time.

29:54.833 --> 29:58.083
We have to move you
to a safe zone immediately.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.666
Come out immediately. This is an order.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.625
Open the door!

30:04.041 --> 30:06.083
I'm coming in there!

30:08.625 --> 30:10.875
This doesn't open. Let's get out of here.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.208
<i>Hi, Belén.</i>

30:29.291 --> 30:30.958
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>

30:31.875 --> 30:33.249
TWO WEEKS LATER...

30:33.250 --> 30:35.541
<i>I hope TSJ
hasn't reached the Canary Islands,</i>

30:36.166 --> 30:40.124
<i>I'm incommunicado, but I'm okay.</i>

30:40.125 --> 30:41.666
NOTICE OF MANDATORY EVACUATION

30:41.791 --> 30:44.583
<i>My only problem is that
I'm starting to run out of food.</i>

30:45.791 --> 30:48.665
<i>I've been thinking about
taking my chances and leaving the house,</i>

30:48.666 --> 30:51.457
<i>but I don't know how dangerous
it might be.</i>

30:51.458 --> 30:54.582
<i>The good thing is that between
the solar panels and the batteries,</i>

30:54.583 --> 30:56.124
<i>I can still stay here for a while.</i>

30:56.125 --> 30:58.540
ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM
LITHIUM BATTERY

30:58.541 --> 31:01.625
And well, never mind...
let's see if I get a signal again.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.833
And we can finally speak.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.000
I love you all.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.958
I don't have anything.

33:44.250 --> 33:47.332
They said they were just going
to get the children to safety,

33:47.333 --> 33:49.125
and he'd be back soon.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.499
But after half an hour,
his phone had already been shut off.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.791
Why didn't you go with the soldiers?

33:55.416 --> 33:59.083
My brother-in-law is in the military
and advised me not to go. And you?

34:01.250 --> 34:03.750
The bus was faster than I was.

34:06.791 --> 34:07.958
You did well.

34:08.083 --> 34:12.165
Imagine what would happen if there's an
outbreak among the people they've taken.

34:12.166 --> 34:14.165
You did well too.

34:14.166 --> 34:18.041
I'm sure they wouldn't have let you take
that beautiful cat you have.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.625
He watches me from the window a lot.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.791
Forgive me for asking you like this...

34:28.208 --> 34:29.958
Do you have anything to eat?

34:31.250 --> 34:34.499
I could barely buy anything
before all this.

34:34.500 --> 34:37.790
And there might be infected people
outside of the residential area.

34:37.791 --> 34:39.832
That's why you're dressed like a diver.

34:39.833 --> 34:42.749
- This? It's--
- So they can't bite you, yeah.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.458
It's well-conceived.

34:46.458 --> 34:49.166
And you haven't even found
a box of cookies?

34:51.333 --> 34:53.958
All the houses I've looked at are empty.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.875
I think I can help you with that.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.750
That one.

35:07.208 --> 35:10.125
That's the Fidalgos.
They went with the soldiers.

35:11.333 --> 35:14.374
But the day before,
I saw them come home with bags.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.750
<i>I doubt they ate everything.</i>

35:22.125 --> 35:23.750
That's the Arnaiz family.

35:23.958 --> 35:27.291
<i>They had five children. So, there may
still be a lot of stuff inside that house,</i>

35:27.416 --> 35:29.583
<i>but hardly a loaf of bread.</i>

35:29.708 --> 35:31.166
The Rosales family.

35:32.541 --> 35:34.458
The youngest was my daughter's friend.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.291
<i>A piece of work.</i>

35:37.000 --> 35:40.375
<i>You might walk in
and find their abandoned parents.</i>

35:42.750 --> 35:44.125
IT WON'T DEFEAT US

35:49.958 --> 35:53.165
<i>There were bigger houses
at the back.</i>

35:53.166 --> 35:56.249
<i>I'm sure you can find us
something to eat there.</i>

35:56.250 --> 35:59.582
<i>- You know everyone.
- Are you calling me a gossip?</i>

35:59.583 --> 36:01.500
<i>I'm calling you my savior.</i>

36:49.375 --> 36:50.375
Walkies.

36:58.083 --> 37:02.624
If this is all we can get,
you should have gone with the military.

37:02.625 --> 37:05.750
We'll end up eating each other here.

37:06.666 --> 37:10.958
That, or the Santa Compaña
will come for both of us.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.832
There might be a house
with food left.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.333
Which one?

37:22.291 --> 37:24.625
- I'll keep you informed, okay?
- Okay.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.833
Gabriela, I'm going in.

38:35.041 --> 38:36.416
I'm sorry.

38:37.541 --> 38:39.999
- I thought no one was here.
- No, no, I...

38:40.000 --> 38:43.291
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving now.
- Wait, wait, we can...

39:31.250 --> 39:32.625
Do you miss them?

39:33.375 --> 39:35.458
I miss that they didn't say goodbye.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.333
Gabriela.

39:41.375 --> 39:45.291
I'm sorry, but I don't think your family
treated you well, not at all.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.416
They did the best they could.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.500
Sometimes things can be done better.

39:53.166 --> 39:56.833
And you? Don't you miss that girl?

39:57.333 --> 39:59.083
I haven't seen her in a while.

40:01.375 --> 40:04.041
- Forgive me for asking, I didn't want...
- No. No, no.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.500
I'm sorry, Gabriela.

40:07.208 --> 40:09.208
She died a little over a year ago.

40:10.250 --> 40:11.916
In a car accident.

40:13.125 --> 40:14.624
I'm sorry.

40:14.625 --> 40:17.666
I don't know, Maybe it's better
she didn't live to see this.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.583
Do you have photos of her?

40:23.458 --> 40:24.541
Yes, of course.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.916
Here.

40:34.541 --> 40:36.125
How lovely.

40:49.125 --> 40:51.124
You should meet my neighbor.

40:51.125 --> 40:54.750
In one week, I have anecdotes to tell
for the rest of my life.

41:02.541 --> 41:03.791
Belén...

41:08.000 --> 41:11.500
Nothing, I just wanted to tell you that
I'm sorry.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.958
For not having come to visit
this whole year.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.833
You only lived half a hour away and...

41:25.833 --> 41:27.208
I've been an idiot.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.291
That's all. It's just...

41:31.583 --> 41:32.958
Sending a kiss.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.708
<i>Are you there?</i>

42:24.083 --> 42:26.000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

42:27.500 --> 42:31.458
- Yes?
<i>- It's Gabriela. Do you have a radio?</i>

42:39.625 --> 42:41.166
<i>On 100.</i>

42:51.500 --> 42:53.333
Okay. Okay, okay.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.791
I think I have something.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.416
- They're playing music.
<i>- Wait.</i>

43:04.541 --> 43:08.332
<i>This message is for all survivors
who are listening.</i>

43:08.333 --> 43:10.749
<i>You can find us in the Arousa Estuary,</i>

43:10.750 --> 43:16.500
<i>- coordinates 36 degrees 37-31 to 72 W.
- What do you think?</i>

43:16.625 --> 43:19.833
<i>- We're sending survivors to the Canaries.</i>
- I don't know.

43:19.958 --> 43:21.915
<i>I don't trust the estuary.</i>

43:21.916 --> 43:25.250
<i>If people gather there,
there will be more risk of infection.</i>

43:26.375 --> 43:28.208
Yeah, but we're running out of food.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.625
We could try.

43:36.041 --> 43:38.333
<i>I don't know, son. I don't know.</i>

43:39.583 --> 43:41.250
<i>And how would we get there?</i>

43:42.416 --> 43:44.250
We could take my boat.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.290
<i>I can't.</i>

43:48.291 --> 43:50.582
What do you mean, you can't?
Of course you can.

43:50.583 --> 43:53.415
<i>I'm barely capable of going out
to the street.</i>

43:53.416 --> 43:55.332
No. Don't worry.

43:55.333 --> 43:58.541
I'll help you. Whatever it takes.

44:00.041 --> 44:01.333
Gabriela.

44:04.625 --> 44:06.125
Can you hear me?

44:16.791 --> 44:18.333
<i>I'm here.</i>

44:20.375 --> 44:21.708
<i>Okay.</i>

44:22.458 --> 44:25.333
<i>If you think I won't be a burden,
I'll go with you.</i>

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
We'll make it, Gabriela.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.083
You'll see.

45:09.833 --> 45:12.666
Gabriela, I'll be there in five minutes.

45:25.708 --> 45:27.333
Gabriela, can you hear me?

45:56.833 --> 45:58.208
Gabriela?

46:02.666 --> 46:03.916
Gabriela!

46:07.458 --> 46:09.125
Gabriela!

46:16.708 --> 46:21.708
THANK YOU FOR THESE DAYS
NOW YOU HAVE TO SAVE YOURSELF

46:22.750 --> 46:24.458
Gabriela.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.290
<i>Belén,</i>

48:36.291 --> 48:38.958
<i>infected people are showing up and...</i>

48:39.958 --> 48:42.583
<i>I don't think I can
wait for you any longer.</i>

48:43.333 --> 48:45.082
<i>I received a message over the radio</i>

48:45.083 --> 48:47.999
<i>from a group of survivors
at the estuary...</i>

48:48.000 --> 48:50.124
<i>who from there are going
to go to the Canaries.</i>

48:50.125 --> 48:52.332
I'm going to meet up with them.

48:52.333 --> 48:55.082
<i>With a little luck,
I'll find a location with coverage</i>

48:55.083 --> 48:57.374
<i>and I'll be able to send you
all this at once.</i>

48:57.375 --> 49:00.458
Don't worry if it takes a few days
to hear from me, okay?

51:49.791 --> 51:52.291
Lúculo! Lúculo!

51:56.708 --> 51:58.332
Lúculo! Lúculo!

51:58.333 --> 52:01.000
Are you okay? Okay, okay.
Okay.

52:05.791 --> 52:07.083
Let's go.

53:39.291 --> 53:40.666
Fuck!

54:14.541 --> 54:16.750
It's all right. Easy.

54:18.541 --> 54:19.875
That's it.

54:23.416 --> 54:25.541
It's all right, that's it. That's it.

56:11.125 --> 56:12.541
Come on.

56:31.958 --> 56:33.083
Damn it!

56:51.250 --> 56:52.708
Hi, sister.

56:53.458 --> 56:55.541
I still haven't found coverage.

56:57.291 --> 57:00.249
You were right not to trust
the safe zones.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.749
Leaving the housing development,

57:01.750 --> 57:05.458
I saw an abandoned military detachment,
or something like that.

57:06.750 --> 57:09.791
And now I'm going down
the Pontevedra Estuary and...

57:10.375 --> 57:12.083
it's all destroyed.

57:13.958 --> 57:17.874
I just want you to know I'm okay,
and I'm strong.

57:17.875 --> 57:21.333
I think I found a way
to get to the Canary Islands.

57:22.666 --> 57:24.000
I love you all.

57:25.791 --> 57:27.708
And I really miss you.

58:47.583 --> 58:51.832
Hey! Hey! Hello! Hello!

58:51.833 --> 58:55.708
Help! Help! Here!

59:23.833 --> 59:26.333
Relax. Relax.

01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:08.833
Hello.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.458
My name is Pritchenko. Viktor Pritchenko.

01:00:32.083 --> 01:00:34.250
He's Ushakov, captain of the boat.

01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:37.833
The captain wants to know
if you're from around here.

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:43.458
Yes. I live very close to Pontevedra.
In a kind of residential development.

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.041
And where are you from?

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:53.290
What were you doing in the estuary?

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:56.124
I've been following the radio message

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:58.416
- to go to the Canary Islands.
- The Canary Islands?

01:01:00.041 --> 01:01:04.208
Yes. The government, the military,
everybody's there.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.250
If you want, I can take you.
I know the route.

01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:18.124
The ship broke down
just as the "viys" arrived.

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:23.083
The police didn't let anyone disembark,
that's why they're all here.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.791
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:34.625
- What do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:42.041
Well, and I have a small
solar panel company.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:56.541
I said you're an engineer.

01:01:57.708 --> 01:01:59.875
Nobody likes lawyers.

01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:08.041
I came from Ukraine to pilot firefighting
helicopters a few months ago.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:11.583
And to see the famous Vigo Christmas.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:14.749
Well, for a Ukrainian,
you speak Spanish very well.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:16.750
Yeah, yeah. My mother was Mexican.

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:20.833
I learned to speak Russian in school.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500
Over there, it was like English.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.041
That's all we can offer now.

01:02:36.791 --> 01:02:40.124
- Thank you very much.
- Tomorrow we'll need you

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:42.124
you to identify locations in the area

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:45.458
where we can find materials, provisions.

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.708
- Okay?
- Of course, whatever you need.

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:50.208
- Okay.
- Excuse me...

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:54.750
Haven't you found any more survivors?

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.875
No, I'm afraid you're the first.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.583
Rest up, okay?

01:04:31.375 --> 01:04:33.291
How did you sleep?

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:41.666
Don't run up the stairs,
they're very slippery.

01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:44.958
The captain wants to talk to you.

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:52.000
Hey, last night,
I saw new people arrive, right?

01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:54.374
Nobody came last night.

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:57.540
What do you mean? There were two men,
and a woman and a girl too.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:59.125
Hey...

01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:02.375
Nobody arrived last night, understood?

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:13.416
This is a car factory. Do you know it?

01:05:13.916 --> 01:05:15.957
I'm sure it's been ransacked,

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:18.791
but you could find
all kinds of materials there.

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:28.208
Concrete. Is there concrete around there?

01:05:29.166 --> 01:05:32.083
I don't know. Concrete?

01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:44.708
There's a plant on the way to Vilagarcía.

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.958
The ones who arrived last night
are downstairs, right?

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:46.333
Ushakov wants your help.

01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:49.916
Say thank you and forget everything else.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:53.041
What the fuck is going on here?

01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:57.999
Viktor, tell me truth. Are we prisoners?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.666
The interrogation is over.

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:09.833
Listen, I know where there's a helicopter.

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:14.374
At a hospital,
on the outskirts of Pontevedra.

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:18.000
We can take it and fly to
the Canary Islands. You're a pilot, right?

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:40.500
Do you want to stay alive?

01:07:41.708 --> 01:07:45.083
Keep your head down.
Don't ask any more questions.

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:03.375
The vacation at sea is over.

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:09.375
Please don't hate me, okay?

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.750
My wife and my daughter!
My wife and my daughter!

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:35.833
- Calm down, please. Calm down.
- Please.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.958
Calm down. Calm down.
I don't know where they are.

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.625
I told you not to get into trouble.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.625
I hope what you said
about the helicopter is true.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:08.750
Hurry up! Faster!

01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:42.666
Come on, Viktor.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:53.583
Hold on, fuck.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.625
CHARGING

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:56.457
There's a heliport at a hospital
very close to here.

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:59.666
You'll see, we'll be in the Canary Islands
before you know it.

01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:06.583
- Viktor, answer me. Viktor, wake up!
- I'm here. I'm here.

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.750
Thank you.

01:16:13.416 --> 01:16:15.666
Thank you for saving my life, Viktor.

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:21.375
Ushakov is a monster.

01:16:22.458 --> 01:16:25.625
This hell fits him like a glove.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:30.750
And what did he do
with the families of these men?

01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:36.375
He's building a refuge
on the island of Sálvora.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:42.541
He only lets those who serve him live.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:50.124
When all this ends, people will have to
answer for what they've done.

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:52.416
Look around you.

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:57.125
This will never end.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.166
No, no, no, no.

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:33.375
Where is it? No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:35.916
What about the helicopter?

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:26.791
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Easy. No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:31.041 --> 01:18:34.375
Let's go, Viktor. Let's go, go, go, go.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.250
Wait here.

01:19:08.291 --> 01:19:09.708
Let's go.

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:12.875
That's it.

01:19:17.208 --> 01:19:19.083
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:22.916
Wait.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.416
Let's go.

01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:37.541
Wait.

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:43.583
Come on.

01:19:45.416 --> 01:19:46.333
Hold on.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.583
Let's go.

01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:55.958
That's it.

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:10.791
- Take it out.
- What?

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:14.791
- I don't understand.
- You have to take the bullet out.

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:17.541
You have to take the bullet out.

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:20.250
Okay.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.791
All right. One moment.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:39.916
Hold on. Hold on, okay?

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:44.375
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:20:45.958 --> 01:20:49.875
Don't move from here.
Stay with him, okay? Go on.

01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:26.083
Max, please.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.915
Go away, they're here!

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.083
Hello?

01:21:34.583 --> 01:21:35.957
Me, Leila.

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:37.625
It was me, Lucía.

01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:41.541
Iria, you'll get caught!

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.500
Hello?

01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:32.875
Hello?

01:23:34.166 --> 01:23:35.583
Hello? Is someone there?

01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:39.665
- Hello?
- Hi. Where are you?

01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:41.957
- There's a man here.
- Where? Down there?

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.916
Yes, down there.

01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.457
- Please.
- Hello.

01:23:45.458 --> 01:23:48.290
There's a man here.
Yes, and you can hear him

01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:50.999
- Hello! Please, here!
- Is someone there?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.958
Yes, yes, hello.
We're in the operating room.

01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:58.500
Hi? We're here. Can you hear us?

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:03.000
No, no, no, no!

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:12.375
Over here! Come on!

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.625
Let's go.

01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:28.332
- Help me.
- Yes.

01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:29.583
Wait.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:34.416
- Come on, Viktor.
- Careful with his neck.

01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:36.000
Let's go.

01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:38.250
The legs.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.291
He's in bad shape. Come on. Let's see.

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:45.041
- Okay. Quickly
- Yes.

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.583
To the back.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.291
Lucía.

01:25:52.875 --> 01:25:55.875
Help us. He's wounded.

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:04.875
- What happened to him?
- He's been shot.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:14.250
Come on, let's go.
Kids, move aside.

01:26:29.916 --> 01:26:31.458
Do you think it scratches?

01:26:32.333 --> 01:26:34.333
- He looks nice.
- Yeah.

01:26:35.708 --> 01:26:38.041
- Do you think he'll let us pet him?
- I don't know.

01:26:42.375 --> 01:26:43.832
You ask.

01:26:43.833 --> 01:26:46.583
- You go, you go. I want to pet him.
- Yes, me. You go.

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:49.791
- You tell him.
- You tell him.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:52.625
What's his name?

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:57.125
- His name is Lúculo.
- Lúculo?

01:26:59.791 --> 01:27:02.500
He was a Roman soldier who ate a lot.

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:05.915
But, don't ask me anything else,
I didn't name him.

01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:09.125
- Is he very old?
- Four years.

01:27:10.166 --> 01:27:11.458
Do you want to pet him?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.375
Come on. Let's go.

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.541
It's okay.

01:27:25.416 --> 01:27:28.166
Relax, they just want to meet you.

01:27:29.708 --> 01:27:31.500
Carefully. Very good.

01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:34.665
- Like this, carefully.
- He's so soft.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.708
- Very good.
- So soft.

01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:38.791
He's very beautiful.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.916
Stay calm, it's okay.
We just want to meet you.

01:27:44.166 --> 01:27:45.583
We've removed the bullet.

01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:48.833
He has a slight fever,
so we have to wait.

01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:52.833
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:27:54.833 --> 01:27:57.333
We didn't know there was anyone in here.

01:27:58.416 --> 01:28:02.458
We were looking for a helicopter,
but we were too late.

01:28:03.708 --> 01:28:05.000
Are you a pilot?

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:18.166
It was the triage and quarantine area.

01:28:19.208 --> 01:28:21.000
It didn't last half a day.

01:28:23.916 --> 01:28:25.791
Is there any way to get down there?

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:28.750
Not from this building.

01:28:29.416 --> 01:28:30.957
The courtyard is full of them,

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:34.000
and without weapons,
we wouldn't last long.

01:28:36.333 --> 01:28:39.416
Below are the boilers,
which have access to the courtyard,

01:28:40.416 --> 01:28:42.833
but a few days ago,
we heard an explosion and I...

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:45.125
I don't know,

01:28:45.458 --> 01:28:50.625
it is dangerous for the children.

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.583
Can your friend really fly
that helicopter?

01:29:15.375 --> 01:29:17.041
Yes. If he recovers, yes.

01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:19.125
We're almost out of food.

01:29:20.916 --> 01:29:21.916
And their parents?

01:29:22.916 --> 01:29:25.833
They died. They worked here.

01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:29.291
It's been very difficult for them.
Poor little angels.

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:36.041
Iria didn't speak for a week.

01:29:37.833 --> 01:29:40.374
Leila is still getting used
to the situation.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.082
Some days, she still asks
when her mother will come back.

01:29:43.083 --> 01:29:45.541
- And what do you tell them?
- The truth.

01:29:46.041 --> 01:29:47.875
In their way, with their words.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.791
We always try and find moments
during the day talk about their parents.

01:29:51.916 --> 01:29:55.165
We ask them to remember
happy moments they shared with them.

01:29:55.166 --> 01:29:57.250
Sister Cecilia, I'm thirsty.

01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:59.625
Okay.

01:30:01.625 --> 01:30:05.957
The key is not to resist the pain

01:30:05.958 --> 01:30:08.250
and to learn to live with it.

01:30:10.208 --> 01:30:12.875
It's the only way
to let it go, little by little.

01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:15.541
If only it were that easy.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.333
My wife died here.

01:30:26.708 --> 01:30:29.875
- A little over a year ago.
- I'm sorry.

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:11.166
...is going into cardiac arrest.

01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:11.208
I'm sorry, Júlia.

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:16.166
I thought we had
all the time in the world.

01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:22.541
Forgive me.

01:33:21.875 --> 01:33:23.708

01:34:24.916 --> 01:34:26.083

Maybe he's gone out...</i>

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:38.000
<i>Come here. Will you quit stealing my...
Stop stealing my phone!</i>

01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:48.708
Belén.

01:34:49.666 --> 01:34:51.125
I'm doing well.

01:34:52.958 --> 01:34:54.750
I'm doing really well now.

01:34:56.166 --> 01:34:57.500
It's just that...

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.291
You wouldn't even believe
where I ended up.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:28.249
- Very dangerous people are coming.
- Did they follow you?

01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:30.708
They're looking for supplies in the area.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.083
You've put us in danger.

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:37.208
We have to reach the helicopter
before them. Where are those tunnels?

01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:39.915
- Let's go.
- What's wrong, Lucía?

01:35:39.916 --> 01:35:41.749
- Let's go change.
- Where are we going?

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:44.375
- Where are we going?
- Let's go, let's go.

01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:48.500
One last effort. I promise.

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:57.125
Your mouth. Tightly.

01:35:57.958 --> 01:35:59.791
Like that. Very good.

01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:02.875
How are you doing? Ready?

01:36:12.625 --> 01:36:15.082
Don't take it off, okay?

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:17.250
No matter what happens. Let's go.

01:36:25.666 --> 01:36:27.666
Careful. There are stairs.

01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:30.666
Slowly. Slowly.

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:37.957
Hey kids, don't look.

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.708
We're sticking together closely.

01:36:53.625 --> 01:36:56.125
- How much left?
- Just a little, I think.

01:37:20.541 --> 01:37:21.958
Did you hear that?

01:37:23.625 --> 01:37:25.208
Let's go, quickly.

01:37:30.791 --> 01:37:32.541
Come on.

01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:52.583
The heat must have warped the door.

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:02.125
Max.

01:38:03.041 --> 01:38:04.833
- Carefully, okay?
- Okay.

01:38:13.666 --> 01:38:15.500
Hit it with the axe.

01:38:55.958 --> 01:38:57.750
Sister Cecilia.

01:39:09.833 --> 01:39:12.791
No. Don't come any closer.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.041
Save the children.

01:39:20.291 --> 01:39:22.208
Please, save them.

01:40:01.416 --> 01:40:05.124
Okay. I think the door is locked
from the outside. I need to open it.

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:07.333
Okay. I'll cover you.

01:41:11.125 --> 01:41:12.583
Mom.

01:41:43.666 --> 01:41:45.666
Let's go.

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:30.916
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:43:06.083 --> 01:43:08.916
- Leila! Oh my God.
- That's it, kids.

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:12.124
- Hey, please... Are you okay?
- Lúculo.

01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:13.707
- That's it...
- Are you okay?

01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:15.833
That's it. That's it, dear,
we're going now.

01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:19.166
Are you okay?

01:43:19.791 --> 01:43:21.583
One last effort.

01:43:21.708 --> 01:43:23.333
What happened?

01:43:30.541 --> 01:43:33.875
How much time do you need
to start the helicopter?

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:38.625
It depends on the shape it's in, but...

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.958
Just a little left, let's go.

01:43:47.583 --> 01:43:49.208
I have a plan.

01:44:40.958 --> 01:44:42.166
They're coming!

01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:42.125
I'm going.

01:45:44.875 --> 01:45:46.291
Quickly.

01:45:47.666 --> 01:45:49.583
Come on, let's go, run!

01:45:50.666 --> 01:45:53.208
- Lucía, run!
- Lucía!

01:45:53.375 --> 01:45:56.040
- Lucía!
- Lucía! Lucía!

01:45:56.041 --> 01:45:57.707
Lucía, run!

01:45:57.708 --> 01:46:00.375
Run, come on! Lucía!

01:46:06.958 --> 01:46:08.916
Run, come on! Lucía!

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:15.582
Lucía!

01:46:15.583 --> 01:46:16.624
- Let's go!
- Lucía, run!

01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:17.625
Run, run!

01:46:18.708 --> 01:46:20.458
Run!

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.250
What's wrong?

01:46:30.625 --> 01:46:31.958
I don't know.

01:46:32.083 --> 01:46:35.500
- No, no, no, this can't happen, Viktor.
- Let me think.

01:46:39.041 --> 01:46:40.291
There's no time.

01:47:49.833 --> 01:47:50.958
Stay calm.

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:08.916
Let's go!

01:50:16.208 --> 01:50:17.833
How are you doing?

01:50:18.958 --> 01:50:20.666
Alive.

01:50:21.833 --> 01:50:24.625
- And you?
- Barely.

01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.250
BELÉN - ANSWER

01:50:50.416 --> 01:50:51.957
- Belén.
<i>- Manel?</i>

01:50:51.958 --> 01:50:53.833
<i>- Manel! Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

01:50:54.250 --> 01:50:56.500
<i>Manel, where are you?</i>

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:59.374
- I'm on my way.
<i>- On your way?</i>

01:50:59.375 --> 01:51:01.833
- In a helicopter, yes.
<i>- What? Say again?</i>

01:51:02.583 --> 01:51:04.957
On my way to the Canary Islands.
I made it, Belén.

01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.915
<i>No! No, no, no!</i>

01:51:06.916 --> 01:51:08.625
<i>- No! Don't come!</i>
- What?

01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:12.207
<i>No! Listen to me!
Don't come to the Canaries.</i>

01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:16.624
<i>For the love of God! Manel!
Manel, don't come to the Canaries.</i>

01:51:16.625 --> 01:51:19.290
<i>Turn back around! Turn around, don't come!</i>

01:51:19.291 --> 01:51:21.458
<i>Please don't come to the Canaries!</i>

01:51:27.416 --> 01:51:28.583
<i>Fourteen to Base...</i>

01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:39.666
