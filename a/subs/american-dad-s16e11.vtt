WEBVTT

00:03.461 --> 00:05.380
And so I thought I'd give

00:05.463 --> 00:07.632
investigative journalism
a whirl.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.552
Well, get a hot scoop,
follow some leads,

00:10.635 --> 00:12.095
write an expose.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.763
Do I...know you?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.598
Hayley Smith.
Remember the name.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.142
I'm gonna be
a famous journalist,

00:17.225 --> 00:19.436
really blow the lid
off something.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.146
Not sure what yet.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.981
But, hey,
that's what the class is for,

00:23.064 --> 00:24.065
nahwhatimeanbrah?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.191
Ow.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.402
Stomp the presses.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.781
Cool butt.
Congratulations.

00:37.579 --> 00:41.124
Journalism. Is. Dead.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.959
This class is mainly
gonna focus

00:43.043 --> 00:46.004
on picking out
the best GIFs for listicles.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.048
That's what journalism is now.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.135

with this watermelon?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.300
Does anyone love watermelon
more than us?

01:32.383 --> 01:35.261
Is this the best day
of our whole lives?

01:40.558 --> 01:43.895
-Mmm.
-You gonna say something or...?

01:43.978 --> 01:44.979
Watermelon?

01:45.063 --> 01:47.065
I'm too depressed.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.276
Okay. Mmm.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.571
It's just that, I was really
excited about journalism.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.241
But my professor said
journalism's dead.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.534
W-What do you think?

01:57.617 --> 01:59.953
Should I continue
or just give up?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.121
You could continue,

02:01.204 --> 02:02.288
you could give up...

02:02.372 --> 02:03.915
Right.
T-That's what I'm asking.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.458
I mean, should I look
for a story?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.252
Or should I
drop the class?

02:07.335 --> 02:10.338
Any way you want it,
that's the way you need it.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.006
Any way you want it.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.424
You're not
saying anything.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.593
I-I want your advice.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.679
Hello?

02:17.762 --> 02:20.265
Beans?
In a salad?

02:20.348 --> 02:21.641
Okay...

02:21.724 --> 02:23.852
Are you pretending
to be on the phone?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.856
Cool.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.649
Well, I'm gonna go get high
in my room

02:29.732 --> 02:32.068
at 2:00 p.m.
on a Wednesday.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.820
Do you have any thoughts
on that?

02:33.903 --> 02:37.824
Wednesday -- it's not spelled
how it sounds.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.868
Ugh!

02:39.951 --> 02:41.452
Mmm.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.706
- The was that?
- My parenting style, baby!

02:44.789 --> 02:48.209
You know my philosophy --
"Benevolent Neglect."

02:48.293 --> 02:49.794
I don't know.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.463
As a mother, you can't
be there all the time.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.300
Eventually, you're going to
let her down.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.468
So how do you prepare her
for that?

02:57.552 --> 03:00.513
By letting her down early
and often.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.640
So, you're saying you're not
gonna be there for her.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.436
Yes.
And that's for her, ya dig?

03:06.519 --> 03:08.438
Ow!
I dig, I dig!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.649
What's Mrs S's problem?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.109
My babe is lost.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.737
Just give my babe some guidance.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.530
Maybe I'm not lost.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.283
And maybe
my professor is wrong.

03:20.366 --> 03:24.454
And maybe I already know
everything about journalism.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.498
Been saying that about you
for years.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
I'm just gonna look
for a story.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.921
That last hit
was a mistake.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.339
I can see that now.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.673
I'm too high.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.343
Me too, babe!

03:43.014 --> 03:46.935
Maybe my story's
about clouds.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.521
Like, how...
where are they sometimes?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.398
Is this something?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.193
I have a worm
in my mouth.

03:55.276 --> 03:59.489
"Something to do
with clouds."

04:02.075 --> 04:04.619
Something to do
with bubbles?

04:04.702 --> 04:07.372
We should've brought
a car.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.457

04:21.803 --> 04:23.263
My reporter's instinct
is telling me

04:23.346 --> 04:25.431
to follow 'em,
find their source.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.309
I'm gonna follow
a different lead.

I'm just a regular Hayley.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.683
My hat's

05:08.766 --> 05:10.393
Okay...

05:10.476 --> 05:12.270
Did you need to sign up
for a class?

05:12.353 --> 05:14.355
'Cause she's about
to start.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.107
-Who she?
-Holly?

05:16.190 --> 05:19.277

05:19.360 --> 05:21.404

to make you a new you.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.701
The first class is free.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.162
We will need a credit card,
though.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.955
The class itself is free.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.666
What you get from the class
costs $500.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.418
That's too high
of a money!

05:35.501 --> 05:39.589
This is an expensive gym
where people have good butts.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.215
I don't think that's a story.
Damn.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.717

I just said so myself.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.613
But I can help.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.282
You need someone to tell you
what to do.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.617
You need me.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.535

06:40.149 --> 06:42.402
get those bank routing numbers
to Lindsay,

06:42.485 --> 06:43.986
and let's get back out there.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.825
Oh, hey, Hayley.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.493
How's journalism class going?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.620
Mom, I dropped that class
months ago.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.914
I am a one-class-at-a-time
kind of person.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.083
And right now, it's five
workout classes a day,

06:57.166 --> 06:58.334
seven days a week.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.961
But only one class
at a time.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.296
That's a physical
limitation I have.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.840
Can't be in two classes
at once.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.217
And I would if I could,
and HG knows that.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.052
She gets
that I'm dedicated.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.304
She hasn't said it,
but sometimes I can feel

07:10.388 --> 07:11.764
her eyes graze over me,

07:11.848 --> 07:14.308
and I feel oceans
of approval and love.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.352
One day,
I am gonna get a DMT.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.396
That stands for
Distressed Muscle Tank.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.773
The DMTs get to work out
next to HG.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.484
I just gotta put in the time,
keep getting better.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.903
I'm gonna go fill up my mattress
with ice and rest up for later.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.574
So, Hayley's in a cult.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.451
Yeah, an exercise cult.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.786
No.
It's a real cult, Roger.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.080
Like Jonestown
with ankle weights.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.415
And I should know.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.250
I've been in more cults
than anyone.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.918
Remind me?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.672
Francine!

07:44.755 --> 07:46.466
Is that
The Scrapbook I hear?

07:46.549 --> 07:47.925
I don't have my keys!

07:48.009 --> 07:49.844
I left them in the car
when I rolled out of it!

07:51.762 --> 07:53.514
-Scrapbook!
-Scrapbook?

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
Oh, shit!

07:54.682 --> 07:57.143
Scrapbook! Yay!

07:57.226 --> 07:59.395
Oh, wow.
Remember this?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.273
I liked wearing all
the red and orange clothes.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.233
Oh, this was this vegan one.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.110
We ate so much spelt.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.571
Some people had a lot of sex
with the guy.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.324
Those cupcakes ended up
being poisoned.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.784
Still have those Nikes
somewhere.

08:13.868 --> 08:17.038
Honey, you might fall for
cults, but let's be real --

08:17.121 --> 08:19.290
cults also fall for you.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.083
Frann-ay!

08:21.167 --> 08:24.128
Always skyrocketing right
into the inner circle.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.213
True.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.798
I'm either a right-hand man
or a high-up wife.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.176
Oh, God, and there's me
on the altar.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.969
You were gonna
sacrifice me.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.846
But then the knife broke!

08:38.267 --> 08:40.478
Ah! That was fun.
I needed that.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.605
-But I gotta get back to it.
-Same.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.733
Yeah, it's a big time
of year for me.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.944
You've been in a lot of cults.
I remember now.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.488
Yeah, cults are really fun,

08:50.571 --> 08:53.950
but I have a sixth sense about
when the fun is over.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.702
You know, when there's
gonna be a FBI raid

08:56.786 --> 08:59.830
or mass soo-ey,
or blend up beavers

08:59.914 --> 09:02.041
and put it in
the town's water supply.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.125
Cool.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.545
How and why did we get
into this convo again?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.296
-Hayley is in a cult.
-Riiight.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.799
-You gonna help her get out?
-I'm not helping her.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.884
She's gotta get out by herself
because --

09:11.968 --> 09:13.344
Benevolent Neglect!

09:13.427 --> 09:15.972
Speaking of which, you know
what I neglect sometimes?

09:16.055 --> 09:17.431
My own needs.

09:17.515 --> 09:20.351
That's not a joke.
It's something sad.

We're having a bit
of a problem.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.827
The fire marshall's
been sniffing around.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.496
He wants to do
an "inspection,"

09:40.580 --> 09:41.998
and we all know
what that means.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.874
He's gonna come in here
and try to shut us down.

19:21.785 --> 19:25.122
Oh, look who it is --
Scoomby-Doo.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.000
So, Holly was a hologram.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.835
HG equals Holly Graham.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.753
You figured it out.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.673
Come on, it's funny!
It's a joke.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.092
You guys should smile more,
by the way.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.596
Yikes, dude.
What is your deal?

19:40.679 --> 19:41.805
My deal?

19:41.889 --> 19:44.892
No one ever asked the
Wizard of Oz what his deal was.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.644
He could sit behind a curtain,
spying on Munkins,

19:47.728 --> 19:50.189
and I can't ogle women
through one-way glass?

19:50.272 --> 19:52.608
I've committed
no crimes here.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.778
Why do I discard the shells
into the same sack

19:56.862 --> 19:58.655
I take the fresh ones out of?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.825
Uh, I frustrate myself.
I should get two sacks.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.243
Sometimes you gotta
swish around

20:03.327 --> 20:05.078
and look for the loosies
at the bottom.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.664
Oooh! Jackpot!

20:07.748 --> 20:10.209
Ugh!
Oh, that was a loogie.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.878
I should not be spitting
my loogies in there.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.174
See?!
You think I'm disgusting.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.884
This is why I need to hide
behind the mirror

20:18.967 --> 20:20.552
in the first place!

20:20.636 --> 20:23.388
You never would have just
let me steal your money

20:23.472 --> 20:25.015
so I could watch you dance
all day

20:25.098 --> 20:26.642
while I sit
on my little toilet,

20:26.725 --> 20:29.561
digging through my garbage bag
full of oysters.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.941
I had to be smart about it.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.445
I see. You're all on
your periods or whatever.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.696
Ooh!

20:39.780 --> 20:41.740
♪ Show off, show off, show off ♪

20:41.823 --> 20:43.742
♪ Boom, show off ♪

20:43.825 --> 20:45.327
Ooh!

20:45.410 --> 20:48.038
♪ Go 'head ♪

20:48.121 --> 20:50.374
♪ Now let me see that
booty work, booty work ♪

20:50.457 --> 20:51.750
♪ Booty, boo-boo-booty work ♪

20:51.833 --> 20:53.835
I never should have made you
so strong!

20:53.919 --> 20:57.381
One last request --
put me back on the toilet.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.716
I wanna die with dignity!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.301
-Suck our butts!
-Suck our butts!

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
Buh-bye! See you soon.
