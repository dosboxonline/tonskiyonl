WEBVTT

00:12.346 --> 00:15.315
man:

00:26.593 --> 00:29.162
Just give it up, Fabian.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.732
man:

00:42.442 --> 00:44.011
Ow!

00:44.044 --> 00:45.312
Aww, man.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.349
Dang it.
This was my year

00:49.383 --> 00:51.084
for the Agent Skills Competition.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.086
I put it on my vision board
and everything.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.489
- Next to the sunset?
- Above the sunset.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.524
Wow. I can't believe
that didn't work.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.459
Well, maybe next time--
and I know this sounds crazy--

00:59.493 --> 01:01.161
you could try not sucking.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.163
Well, you don't have to be
a dick about it.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.431
Have to? No.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.033
But then I wouldn't
be able to tell you

01:06.066 --> 01:07.367
that the Treaty of Versailles called,

01:07.401 --> 01:09.403
and it wants its total failure
to achieve any

01:09.436 --> 01:11.004
of its stated goals back.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.573
Also, it's sorry about Europe.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.709
Well, if you're so great,
why is your intel so bad?

01:15.742 --> 01:17.544
My name's not Fabian.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.580
Oh, I know that.
That's my boss's name.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.281
Yelling it gets me in the mood
to shoot people

01:21.315 --> 01:22.716
that I pretend are him.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.518
- Well, you got lucky.
- Sure.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.386
Though, in a mirror maze,
maybe consider

01:26.420 --> 01:28.789
not putting on a gallon
of cologne that smells like...

01:28.822 --> 01:31.258
Gasoline
and decaying hobo foot.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.694
Ow.

01:33.727 --> 01:37.364
Now what was that for?
- You're still wearing it.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.238
Hello, Clandesti-con,

02:18.272 --> 02:20.674
where spying meets
sweaty buffet food.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.576
Who wants a brochure for IIA,

02:22.609 --> 02:25.279
the soulless company
that is making us do this?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.681
Come on, Lana.
Let's have some fun with it.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.550
We'll take these lemons
and make--

02:29.583 --> 02:32.019
Concentrated citric acid
to spray in our own eyes?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.387
I have some in my purse
if you need it.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.789
This isn't so bad.
When I temped at IIA,

02:35.822 --> 02:38.091
they were trying
to increase productivity,

02:38.125 --> 02:40.460
so they docked your pay if you
peed more than twice a day.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.763
Ugh. I hate this company.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.332
Nice job in the competition, Archer.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.535
Though calling your opponent
"Fabian" raised eyebrows.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.204
These two specifically.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.206
Well, despite the fact
that you're praising me,

02:52.239 --> 02:53.540
which makes it nearly
impossible for me

02:53.574 --> 02:56.376
to not like you, I still
definitely wanna murder you.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.712
Today is a crucial day
for all of you.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.647
We are launching The Agency

03:00.681 --> 03:04.218
as a distinct boutique branch
of IIA.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.652
Wait, really?
We'll have autonomy?

03:05.686 --> 03:09.590
Yes. Exactly as much autonomy
as Kermit the Frog.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.159
Yo, you think Miss Piggy
is abusing him?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.027
I know she plays rough, but--

03:14.061 --> 03:15.596
I get the feeling
he enjoys it.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.798
Who wouldn't?
Roughed up by a pig in jewelry.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.601
No. I mean you'll be
a thin piece of fabric

03:20.634 --> 03:22.569
with my hand up your ass.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.371
Where's your sense of wonder?

03:24.404 --> 03:28.275
IIA represents 60%
of private spying,

03:28.308 --> 03:31.111
but some clients
are too mired in the past.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.381
They want a personal touch. Authenticity.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.583
That's what you lot are for--
to fake that.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.620
So pretend we're independent
to make IIA more successful

03:39.653 --> 03:42.189
and allow you
to ruthlessly exploit us.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.491
Welcome to the concept
of a job.

03:44.525 --> 03:48.095
Now, I'm giving the keynote
for the conference later today:

03:48.128 --> 03:51.198
a speech entitled
"Leadership as a Network."

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066
You can't just say
"noun as a different noun"

03:53.100 --> 03:54.401
and pretend
that it means something.

03:54.434 --> 03:57.471
Sure I can. I call it
"language as a weapon."

03:57.504 --> 03:59.139
Now, Archer, you need to win

03:59.173 --> 04:00.674
the Agent Skills Competition

04:00.707 --> 04:03.343
if we're going to launch
The Agency properly.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.479
By the way,
the board hates the idea.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.247
They'd rather you were
completely broken up

04:07.281 --> 04:08.749
and redistributed.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.151
So, Archer,
our fate is in your hands.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.654
- Well, sayonara, guys.
- Oh, boy.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.722
You know what?
I'll be honest with you.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.026
That's a responsibility
I take very seriously.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.597
Round of Glengoolie Blues, please.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.133
I'm looking for one of you

04:26.166 --> 04:28.101
to take the mantle
of leadership.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.038
Under me, of course.
So dot, dot, dot.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.773
Are the dots supposed
to make me love stickers?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.741
Damn it! I should be in
the competition with Archer!

04:34.775 --> 04:37.110
No, Lana. I need you here,

04:37.144 --> 04:38.345
front and center.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.646
And don't be afraid
to get out there

04:39.680 --> 04:41.715
and really be diverse.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.084
Remember, a personal touch.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.419
- You heard him, sweetheart.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.787
A personal touch.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.655
Hey, would you like
some stickers?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.757
They're edible.
- They don't look edible.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.759
Anything's edible
if you try hard enough.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.095
-
- Aww, lucky.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.663
Should we do something?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.765
Like make popcorn? Or what?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.535
-
- Now where is she going?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.507
I think you got me.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.209
See? You just get me.
I do feel a responsibility

05:09.243 --> 05:10.744
to keep my mother's legacy alive,

05:10.777 --> 05:13.547
but on the other hand, now I
don't have to worry about being

05:13.580 --> 05:16.049
yelled at by the one person
in the world who scares me.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.553
So do I go with responsibility,
or do I go balls to the wall?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.522
Or, more accurately,
balls to the wall

05:21.555 --> 05:23.690
then through that wall
into an adjoining wall

05:23.724 --> 05:25.192
that's probably load-bearing.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.364
So...which is it?

05:32.299 --> 05:33.600
I'm thinking.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.537
Robert: I thought that was you, Lana.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.672
Finally.
- Robert? What the hell?

05:38.705 --> 05:40.607
Did you just fly
all the way to Dubai

05:40.641 --> 05:43.010
to hear me say,
"Talk to my divorce lawyer?"

05:43.043 --> 05:45.412
Yes. And was on the way
to Abu Dhabi.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.215
Now, I get that I'm the one
who's mostly at fault here--

05:48.248 --> 05:50.517
- Mostly?
- But you aren't blameless.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.686
And we need to think about
what's best for AJ.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.122
Oh-ho-ho. Is that
why you nailed that skank?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.457
For AJ? What, were you looking
for a parenting book

05:57.491 --> 05:58.759
between her piss flaps?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.128
No. That's not where they
keep those.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.129
What are you even
worried about?

06:02.162 --> 06:03.363
We signed a prenup.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.132
Well, there is the issue
of custody.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.600
Excuse me?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.235
I'm just being realistic.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.537
It was your job
that got AJ kidnapped.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.640
To a judge, that sounds
like an unsafe environment.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.375
And if they put AJ
on the stand,

06:15.409 --> 06:18.645
are you 100% sure
she chooses you?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.480
Why do you have teeth marks
on your elbow?

06:20.514 --> 06:22.583
I'll show you.
Do you like stickers?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.518
I'm sensing you need space.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.054
- What?
- Shouldn't you be

06:27.087 --> 06:28.222
back at the booth?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.290
No, because what I do
is kick ass.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.092
And I should be
in the competition

06:32.125 --> 06:35.095
so I can take over
when Archer screws up.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.265
Come, now. Archer is reliable
when he needs to be.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.267
He's resting right now
for his next round.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.270
Uh, did he specify
the type of round?

06:43.303 --> 06:44.505
Archer: Whoo-hoo!

06:49.076 --> 06:51.778
I'm not totally convinced
that's a downside.

06:51.812 --> 06:56.116
It's like his liver absorbs
alcohol and excretes luck.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.652
Having said that, you can stay
in the competition.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.320
Thank you.
I was going to anyway,

07:00.354 --> 07:01.522
you absolute turd.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.524
But thank you.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.459
Archer: The competition
is basically a formality.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.761
I'm generally considered
the world's greatest spy.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.297
Yes. You absolutely were.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.333
You know, I used to be a spy
just like you.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.435
Oh, who'd you spy for,
the Etruscans?

07:15.469 --> 07:17.070
Hmm. Indeed.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.073
In this biz, one minute,
you're the greatest thing

07:20.107 --> 07:22.042
since the 3:00 p. m.
dinner special,

07:22.075 --> 07:24.411
and the next,
dog shit on a bun.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.614
My advice?
Buy mustard, lad.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.250
Why would I buy mustard
to eat myself?

07:30.284 --> 07:33.020
So you think about that.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.088
Ugh. Why are you
in such a great mood?

07:35.122 --> 07:37.491
Why don't you ask your face?

07:37.524 --> 07:40.227
My face says Robert's
gonna fight for custody of AJ.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.461
Um, can he do that?

07:41.495 --> 07:42.729
Well, when you have
that much money,

07:42.763 --> 07:44.364
turns out you can pretty much
do anything.

07:44.398 --> 07:45.666
Why is AJ not picking up?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.601
A kid not picking up
a phone call?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.137
Weird.
Did you try her telegraph?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.739
Or lighting the signal fires
of Gondor?

07:52.773 --> 07:55.709
Why is everything
so complicated?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.312
Because you're divorcing one
of the world's richest men-

07:58.345 --> 08:01.148
slash-ex-boss who wants custody
of the daughter you had

08:01.181 --> 08:03.383
with a different coworker.
- Well, sure, but--

08:03.417 --> 08:05.385
All while you work
for a corporate behemoth

08:05.419 --> 08:07.287
that seems to be trying
to take over the world.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.090
Yes. All of that. I guess.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.593
Well, I discovered the answer
to all those problems, Lana.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
It's simple, it's easy,

08:14.628 --> 08:17.497
and it's right at the bottom
of this glass.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.801
Well, it wasn't at the bottom
of that one,

08:20.834 --> 08:23.136
But I'm no quitter.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.272
Behold, an audio bug.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.708
Ooh.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.645
And that's all it does.
The wonders of IIA science.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.248
A microphone.
Truly groundbreaking--

08:34.281 --> 08:36.517
for 1876.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.619
Hey, what's that new one
you're working on called?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.154
The wheel?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.456
Got 'em good, Ikari.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.291
I am working on something
called The Wheel!

08:44.324 --> 08:46.226
But it's a sex thing...

08:46.260 --> 08:49.696
that I can't build at work.
And you call that justice?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.265
Okay, look, I get it.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.201
IIA might not be
the "cool upstart rebel,"

08:54.234 --> 08:55.636
but this ain't
"The Breakfast Club,"

08:55.669 --> 08:58.172
and Judd Nelson doesn't end up
with Molly Ringwald.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.574
He ends up at the bottom of
a lake wearing concrete shoes

09:00.607 --> 09:02.476
with my frickin' initials
on them.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.578
That's the power of IIA
with The Agency

09:04.611 --> 09:06.246
as your personal concierge.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.115
I'm intrigued.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.150
And tell them Ray Gillette
sent you.

09:10.184 --> 09:12.452
Wh--stealing my customers?
Really?

09:12.486 --> 09:14.188
You think that'll get you
Mallory's chair?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.322
All's fair in love and--

09:15.355 --> 09:16.723
Ow!
- Ahh!

09:16.757 --> 09:18.325
- Damn it!
-

09:18.358 --> 09:19.560
Where the hell'd
you come from?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.596
A good leader always keeps
tabs on his team.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.498
So spying on us?

09:24.531 --> 09:26.567
How is it that passing out brochures

09:26.600 --> 09:28.235
is somehow beyond you?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.170
And why are you standing there
nodding?

09:30.204 --> 09:32.139
I said I wanted leadership.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.141
You look like a bobblehead
they give away

09:34.174 --> 09:36.677
to raise awareness
for diabetic librarians.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.246
Technically, I'm prediabetic.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.583
Oh, what are we gonna do
about that guy?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.151
Complain and then nothing?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.719
This is fun.
Ask me another one.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.355
Here's some fun.
I just put a bug on Fabian.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.723
If we get dirt on him,

09:49.756 --> 09:52.292
maybe then he'll approve
my design for the gun bomb.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.328
You see, it looks like a gun--

09:54.361 --> 09:56.230
Or improve
working conditions.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.099
Yeah. We were promised
curated snacks.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.035
At this point, your blood's
just melted Otter Pops, huh?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.637
Well, you guys have fun.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.640
I'm off to find the best part
about every convention:

10:06.673 --> 10:08.408
the party room.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.745
Oh, if Fabian comes back, tell
him he can gnaw on my chode.

10:14.248 --> 10:16.250
Yeah, I'm not gonna
tell him that.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.553
Come
on. Let's hear
some bottles popping,

10:19.586 --> 10:22.389
maybe some fun squishy noises.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.625
Whoa. Now, that's contraband.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.463
Not following you.
I'm not following you.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.698
Just checking stuff out.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.136
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:36.170 --> 10:39.640
Who's ready to Pam-page?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.443
Oh. Wrong party.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.112
Hey, get her!

10:49.516 --> 10:53.120
I need to party at work
more often.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.589
We are gonna crush
this next event.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.057
Whoa. Lana.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.258
High-fiving
is one of those things

10:58.292 --> 11:00.027
you should never do when drunk,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.629
like bomb disposal
or helping deliver a baby.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.298
Haven't you done
both of those?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.599
That's how I know.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.401
All right. Now, nobody worry,

11:07.434 --> 11:09.269
'cause Archer and I
have been resting--

11:09.303 --> 11:10.504
- Ahh!
- Shit!

11:10.537 --> 11:12.472
Guys, there was a room.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.308
Guns--lots.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.009
Like, they're probably coming.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.311
Kind of sounds
like you're coming.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.446
Kaboom!
That's a new thing I do.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.415
No, you don't. And it doesn't
even sound like that.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.584
- How would you know?
- Solid burn.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.552
But Pam,
look at the security here.

11:25.586 --> 11:26.687
They don't allow guns
on the floor,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.255
so what would they even do?

11:28.288 --> 11:29.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, guys.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.059
Something's happening
with Fabian.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.461
No! You'll pay for this!

11:34.494 --> 11:36.530
You'll never take me alive!

11:38.131 --> 11:40.367
Okay, so you took me alive.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.237
So, uh...what?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
Okay, now that we've had
a moment to process--what?

11:50.244 --> 11:52.045
Why are they kidnapping him?

11:52.079 --> 11:54.748
They're probably trying
to humiliate IIA.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.350
It's right before his speech,

11:56.383 --> 11:58.051
so they'll have to admit
he's kidnapped,

11:58.085 --> 11:59.486
and if they can't protect
their own,

11:59.520 --> 12:01.154
then how are they gonna
protect you?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.724
Then they parade him,
and then they kill him.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.225
What?
We were all thinking it.

12:05.259 --> 12:07.261
Does this solve everything?

12:07.294 --> 12:09.563
Yeah, except he said that
the board would break us up

12:09.596 --> 12:11.365
and redistribute us.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.201
Wait, are we actually
gonna save Fabian?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.103
No.
We're gonna save Fabian.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.038
You two have to win
that competition.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.673
We still need a splash
for The Agency.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.041
Plus if you dropped out,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.409
the kidnappers
will know something's up.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.012
Ugh. I really wish
I hadn't had that many drinks.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.580
Me too, but the opposite.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.283
So what's your next event?

12:30.584 --> 12:32.252
woman: Nearing the drop zone.

12:32.286 --> 12:34.721
If you are to die,
please take comfort in the fact

12:34.755 --> 12:37.224
that it will not upset me
at all.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.627
Ugh. Oh, I'm gonna puke.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.564
Wow. Is it Dartmouth freshman
orientation already?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.566
Seriously, if you were any more
of a lightweight,

12:45.599 --> 12:47.067
you'd be levitating.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.368
Should we be, like...

12:48.402 --> 12:50.070
More concerned about
this Fabian thing?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.206
Nah.
The rest of the gang is on it.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.675
- Well, we could--

12:54.708 --> 12:57.077
Ooh, or we could, um...

12:57.110 --> 13:00.614
I hate to ask,
but who got kidnapped again?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.449
Still no call back from AJ.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.484
Okay, I'll just text her and
tell her that I'll take her out

13:04.518 --> 13:05.719
this weekend
and do whatever she wants.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.454
Wrong.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.289
You just demanded more time
from her,

13:09.323 --> 13:10.657
and now she just
resents you.

13:10.691 --> 13:12.359
Text her that you were
just thinking of her

13:12.392 --> 13:13.660
and how proud you are.

13:13.694 --> 13:15.629
Then write,
"No need to respond."

13:15.662 --> 13:17.197
How do you know this stuff?

13:17.231 --> 13:18.565
It helps
that I've never moved

13:18.599 --> 13:20.067
past emotional adolescence.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.768
This event is very simple.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.571
Five briefcases.
Five spots in the finals.

13:24.605 --> 13:26.673
No weapons. Any question?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.546
Archer: Whoo-hoo!

13:32.579 --> 13:35.148
Johnny Utah!

13:38.285 --> 13:39.720
Excuse me.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.154
Excuse me.
-

13:41.188 --> 13:42.689
Pardon me. Pardon me.

13:42.723 --> 13:44.024
Oh, 'scuse me. Pardon me.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.131
Falkor, away!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.406
Oh, ahh!

13:59.439 --> 14:02.676
I guess we're interpreting
"no weapons" pretty liberally.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.614
Ahh! Disgusting!

14:07.648 --> 14:10.184
Uh, let's not tell anyone
about this.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.085
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:17.591 --> 14:19.092
Decent trade.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.528
Woman: Altitude warning.
Pull now.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.103
- Ahh!
- You big baby.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.572
Just use your backup chute.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.242
Unless we were way lower
than I thought.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.211
Really should have been keeping
tabs on that.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.579
Oh, well.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.747
Cyril: Well, what?
Cheryl: Well, catch me up.

14:40.781 --> 14:42.683
You've been here
the whole time.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.251
Quiet down.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.320
We're trying to flirt our way
to finding out

14:46.353 --> 14:49.690
who booked that conference room
full of dudes and guns.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.160
And striking out. 0 for 2.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.728
I don't know, y'all.
I can't get a read.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.231
He's like
a sexual Rubik's Cube.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.633
Or as I call it,
a Rubik's Cube.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.735
Huh.
Maybe I should give him a try.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.471
I've developed a sexual
nervous system stimulator

15:04.505 --> 15:06.507
I call "The Wheel."

15:06.540 --> 15:08.642
Okay, I'll bite.
Why is it called The Wheel?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.512
Because once it gets rolling,
there's no stopping it.

15:11.545 --> 15:13.447
Any other ideas?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.616
Literally anything.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.018
Can I help any of you

15:18.051 --> 15:20.454
in some way that does not
involve, and I quote,

15:20.487 --> 15:22.322
"a hot beef enema"?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.191
- That wasn't me!
- I panicked!

15:24.224 --> 15:26.493
Just stand right there.
Hold on.

15:26.527 --> 15:27.728
Keep standing.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.229
Really,
I don't have time for--

15:29.263 --> 15:31.598
- And you're overwhelmed.
- Oh. Oh. Ahh.

15:31.632 --> 15:33.200
Ahh, ahh, ahh. Ahh!

15:33.233 --> 15:35.369
Got it! Whoever booked
the conference room

15:35.402 --> 15:37.337
is staying in the Sultan Suite.
clerk: Ahh! Ahh! Oh!

15:37.371 --> 15:38.472
You ever lend that thing out?

15:38.505 --> 15:40.207
Sure.
Just clear your schedule,

15:40.240 --> 15:43.243
because it goes for, like,
a couple of days.

15:43.277 --> 15:44.545
clerk: Oh.

15:44.578 --> 15:46.613
So we enter,
clear the guards--

15:46.647 --> 15:48.715
With what?
We don't have guns.

15:48.749 --> 15:50.350
Guys, in the dealer's hall.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.319
There's a ton of non-lethals
in there.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.055
Tasers, air hammers,
something called a knife light.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.590
Well,
then let's get sampling.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.258
All right.
We're in the finals.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.427
It's getting intense.
They tried to kill us up there.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.329
- How are things here?
- Great.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.665
We've located Fabian
and the kidnappers,

16:04.698 --> 16:06.466
and we've got a plan
to get them back.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.635
You do?
I was assuming you'd fail.

16:08.669 --> 16:10.504
And why would you think that?

16:10.537 --> 16:13.140
Because you're you?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.242
- This was the plan!
- I didn't think it would work.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.511
Are we really saving this guy?
He sucks.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.047
I hate him, and he's gonna make
us do bad jobs

16:20.080 --> 16:21.748
for terrible people.
- You think I want this?

16:21.782 --> 16:24.218
All I want is to do my job
and go home.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.620
But if we get fired, that's not
gonna help my custody problem.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.222
Custody problem?

16:28.255 --> 16:30.257
If you need me to give Robert
a personal tour

16:30.290 --> 16:32.659
of an industrial thresher,
say the word.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.228
- No.
- Got it.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.096
- No, you don't.
- Okay.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.334
But, I mean, saving Fabian is
the only way we stay together.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.035
Right?
- We'll figure the rest out,

16:42.069 --> 16:43.437
but not if we're separated.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.372
Y'all--y'all are family.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.407
Oh, my God.
Is this what it's come to?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.343
Acting responsibly?

16:49.376 --> 16:51.778
Ugh. Fine.
Let's go save a jerk's life,

16:51.812 --> 16:53.714
thereby making the world
a worse place.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.716
Yay for the good guys.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.484
Should we even do
the competition?

16:57.518 --> 16:59.353
If you drop out now,
the kidnappers will know

16:59.386 --> 17:01.054
something's up and kill Fabian.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.356
So what's the final event?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.091
Gonne be hard
to top skydiving.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.459
woman: And now,

17:05.492 --> 17:08.161
it's time to reveal
the final event

17:08.195 --> 17:11.131
of the Clandesti-con
Agent Skills Competition.

17:11.164 --> 17:14.134
Your final event will be

17:14.168 --> 17:18.438
King of the Train!

17:20.107 --> 17:22.009
Holy shit.

17:22.042 --> 17:25.612
Forget responsibility.
I'm gonna be king of the train.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.086
Stay on your toes.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.022
One of us has to win
to keep The Agency alive and--

17:35.055 --> 17:36.590
Uh, yeah. Whatever.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.560
I'm gonna be king of the train.
Toot toot!

17:39.593 --> 17:41.595
Ugh.
Everyone in position?

17:41.628 --> 17:44.031
Yeah. But this stuff
from the dealer's hall

17:44.064 --> 17:45.566
isn't the most intimidating.

17:45.599 --> 17:47.000
I don't even know
what this does.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.671
Yeah, we're gonna need
a few minutes.

17:50.704 --> 17:52.139
Archer: I'll signal you
at the start.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.174
Chances are,
they'll be distracted watching

17:54.208 --> 17:57.444
the closed-circuit feed
of my glorious victory.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.580
If you touch the ground

17:59.613 --> 18:02.449
or get hit by a paintball,
you're out.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.318
You start with no weapons,

18:04.351 --> 18:07.087
but you may find some
at points on the train,

18:07.120 --> 18:10.424
as well as a few surprises.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.326
Now, the time has come

18:12.359 --> 18:16.597
to find the most skilled agent
in the world.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.304
woman: Three. Two. One.

18:24.338 --> 18:27.007
Begin!
-

18:28.208 --> 18:30.577
Shocking.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.579
Kaboom!

18:34.214 --> 18:35.549
- Ahh!
-

18:36.750 --> 18:38.318
Whoa!

18:47.094 --> 18:48.462
-

18:48.495 --> 18:50.330
Ahh!

18:53.200 --> 18:55.002
Ahh!

18:55.035 --> 18:57.538
Oh, knife light! Now I get it.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.307
Hold still,
Cirque du Suck Ass!

19:03.343 --> 19:06.547
We're leaving. Nobody move,
or Fabian gets it.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.282
Do what he says!

19:15.789 --> 19:17.057
Archer! Duck!

19:17.357 --> 19:19.293
Ooh.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.161
Ugh.

19:21.195 --> 19:22.729
God.
You couldn't just duck?

19:22.763 --> 19:24.598
You know I have trust issues, Lana,

19:24.631 --> 19:27.167
which you are
partially responsible for.

19:27.201 --> 19:28.268
- How?
- I don't know,

19:28.302 --> 19:29.336
but it feels right!

19:34.942 --> 19:37.578
Oh, now
she has a jetpack
and a machine gun?

19:37.611 --> 19:38.579
How is that fair?

19:44.751 --> 19:47.087
- Still want that jetpack?
- I know you want me to say no,

19:47.120 --> 19:49.056
but the answer is still yes!

19:53.093 --> 19:54.428
Pam: We need backup!

19:54.461 --> 19:55.762
They're bringing Fabian
to the floor!

19:55.796 --> 19:58.065
- Throw me the gun!
- It's empty!

19:58.098 --> 19:59.166
Just throw it to me!

20:01.335 --> 20:03.370
Man, this is such
a bad idea.

20:05.606 --> 20:07.174
- Whoa!
-

20:14.348 --> 20:15.449
Archer: Look out!

20:22.189 --> 20:25.192
Everyone,
this is what we think of IIA.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.493
Lana. Lana.

20:26.527 --> 20:28.562
Do something!
Lana, I know you're faking.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.064
No.
I'm very, very unconscious.

20:31.098 --> 20:33.066
Why am I always
the responsible one?

20:33.100 --> 20:35.469
And so I don't shoot Fabian
for me.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.704
I shoot him for--
- Ahh!

20:37.738 --> 20:40.307
woman: What an amazing performance.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.043
Congratulations
to the king of the train,

20:43.076 --> 20:45.579
Agent Lana Kane,

20:45.612 --> 20:50.150
representing The Agency,
a boutique subsidiary of IIA.

20:50.184 --> 20:52.052
- God damn it.
- Thank you.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.054
Thank you. You're too kind.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.490
And great work by The Agency.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.592
Now, that was obviously

20:58.625 --> 21:01.328
a fake kidnapping
and assassination,

21:01.361 --> 21:02.729
but they didn't know that.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.599
In fact, this was
the demonstration portion

21:05.632 --> 21:09.036
of my talk,
"Leadership as a Network."

21:09.069 --> 21:13.140
I turned this unruly bunch into
a finely-honed fighting force.

21:13.173 --> 21:16.343
Sterling Archer himself stepped
between me and a bullet

21:16.376 --> 21:19.279
despite the fact
that he hates my guts.

21:19.313 --> 21:21.281
That is the power
of leadership.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.684
Well, thank you all

21:23.717 --> 21:25.452
for helping me with my speech.

21:25.485 --> 21:29.022
So who gets to be
head of The Agency?

21:29.056 --> 21:31.425
I gave away the most brochures. Kaboom.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.027
Jesus, Cyril. Not the time.

21:34.061 --> 21:36.063
But it's me, right?
See me lead that mission?

21:36.096 --> 21:38.065
Actually,
it's Agent Gillette.

21:38.098 --> 21:40.067
So, uh, what?

21:40.100 --> 21:42.569
Because he understood
the true mission.

21:42.603 --> 21:45.439
He's been gathering dirt
on all of you for years,

21:45.472 --> 21:48.675
which he has compiled
in this very convenient binder.

21:48.709 --> 21:51.712
Like "Pam once snuck a goat
into the office.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.581
No one knows why."
- I was fostering it.

21:54.615 --> 21:56.316
And the next week,
she brought in

21:56.350 --> 21:58.318
goat meat tacos for everyone.

21:58.352 --> 22:01.054
That goat's personality
was very toxic.

22:01.088 --> 22:04.591
Well, I'm sure you have
a lot to talk about.

22:04.625 --> 22:07.694
You backstabbing
son of a bitch.

22:07.728 --> 22:11.698
In my defense, I did not know
he was gonna tell everybody.

22:11.732 --> 22:14.034
Aww. Heh.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.302
Look.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.437
You know, you're good at this, Archer.

22:17.471 --> 22:20.707
It'll take time, but maybe you
should get more involved.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.276
You're right.
And, you know,

22:22.309 --> 22:23.710
I didn't wanna let you win,

22:23.744 --> 22:26.313
but up there on the train,
I suddenly had this idea--

22:26.346 --> 22:28.315
being declared the best agent
in the world.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.350
That's gotta help
your custody case for AJ.

22:30.384 --> 22:32.352
And that keeps her in my life.

22:32.386 --> 22:36.323
Aww. Buddy, that won't affect
the case at all.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.691
They don't consider
that kind of thing.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.326
God damn it. That's it!

22:39.359 --> 22:41.328
I've learned
a very valuable lesson today.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.031
Making the responsible choice
is for suckers.

22:44.064 --> 22:46.466
Until now, I've been
the careful, restrained,

22:46.500 --> 22:48.669
subtle, rule-respecting Archer.

22:48.702 --> 22:51.071
- What?
- But that is over!

22:51.104 --> 22:53.040
Welcome to the new Archer.

22:53.073 --> 22:55.442
I'm gonna go find two bottles
of whiskey, three women,

22:55.475 --> 22:58.178
a full-color illustrated
edition of the Kama Sutra,

22:58.212 --> 23:01.281
and six gallons
of orange sports drink.

23:01.315 --> 23:04.318
I will see you all
one: when I feel like it,

23:04.351 --> 23:06.520
and two: in hell!

23:09.356 --> 23:11.191
God damn it.

23:30.110 --> 23:33.046
Made in Georgia.
