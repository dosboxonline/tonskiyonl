[heavy breathing]

01:25.500 --> 01:27.500
[dogs barking]

01:36.541 --> 01:37.750
[man 1] Something's out there!

01:38.541 --> 01:39.625
Iver, follow them.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.625
Go see what it is, quickly.
Hand me the lantern.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.208
It's the captain! It's the captain!

01:50.291 --> 01:52.333
Whoa.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.250
Whoa!

01:54.416 --> 01:56.000
[ragged breathing]

01:58.208 --> 01:59.916
Sir, did you find anything?

02:00.500 --> 02:03.583
-Help Jørgensen. His feet are frozen.
-[man 2] Right, come on.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.500
[grunts]

02:05.583 --> 02:08.708
-[man 3] Holm's on his way.
-[man 1] Quick, Unger. Get the water.

02:08.791 --> 02:10.458
[man 2] Jørgensen, lift your head up.

02:10.541 --> 02:12.958
-Unger, hurry up with the water.
-It's coming!

02:15.083 --> 02:17.500
-[man 4] Raise it. Easy.
-[man 1] It's all right. We got you.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.833
-We got you.
-[man 4] Take it easy, Jørgensen.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.750
[man 2] Unger, the water.

02:23.666 --> 02:25.083
-Come on!
-[Unger] It's coming.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.333
[man 4] Hold these.
Take it easy, Jørgensen.

02:27.416 --> 02:29.458
[Jørgensen breathing heavily]

02:30.291 --> 02:33.083
-Do you have some whiskey?
-[man 1] Yes. Get the man a drink.

02:35.958 --> 02:36.791
[Unger] Here.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.125
Wait, wait.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.041
[captain] I'll take that.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.416
-[man 2] Ejnar, hold him down.
-[Jørgensen exhales]

02:47.500 --> 02:49.666
[man 1] Jørgensen, breathe.
Keep breathing.

02:50.958 --> 02:51.958
Let's do this.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.250
[Jørgensen breathing heavily]

02:54.333 --> 02:55.375
[Ejnar] Okay.

02:56.666 --> 02:58.041
[Jørgensen grunts]

02:58.750 --> 03:02.208
-[man 4] Hold him.
-[Ejnar] One, two, three.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.750
-[bone cracks]
-[screams]

-["Joy to the World" playing]
-[Unger humming]

03:25.250 --> 03:26.083
All right.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.250
-Thank you.
-Got it?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.625
-[sighs]
-Good. Smells like Christmas.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.125
One, two, three.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.125
-Oh!
-[laughs]

03:34.208 --> 03:35.708
-[Ungar] Who's hungry?
-Everybody.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.166
[crew] Starving.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.333
[Ungar] Here we go, boys.

03:38.416 --> 03:39.541
-Looks great.
-Finally.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.875
[man 1] You've done yourself proud,
sunshine.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.708
-It's about time we found a use for you.
-[laughter]

03:44.791 --> 03:47.250
[Ejnar] Gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

03:47.333 --> 03:49.333
-Party's over.
-[man 2] Quiet, Poulsen.

03:49.416 --> 03:52.333
-I want you all to raise your glasses…
-[crew] Of course.

03:52.916 --> 03:53.833
[Ejnar] …to…

03:56.125 --> 03:57.625
to loved ones back home,

03:58.208 --> 03:59.791
to the men who gave their lives

03:59.875 --> 04:02.291
exploring the last unknown parts
of our kingdom.

04:03.583 --> 04:04.916
To the Denmark Expedition.

04:06.250 --> 04:07.208
And to you,

04:07.291 --> 04:09.708
for joining me
in fulfilling their mission.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.625
Skål.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.541
Skål.

04:11.625 --> 04:12.500
Halfway there.

04:13.750 --> 04:14.708
[Ejnar] Ah!

04:14.791 --> 04:17.416
Our long search
didn't go quite as planned.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.958
-Jørgensen can testify to that.
-[quiet chuckles]

04:20.041 --> 04:21.291
As expected,

04:21.375 --> 04:24.333
it was hard to trace any signs
of the vanished expedition.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.125
However,

04:27.250 --> 04:28.458
we found this.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.041
A diary from one of the men.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.625
And a map

04:37.208 --> 04:39.041
that apparently shows the location

04:39.125 --> 04:40.500
of the cairn

04:40.583 --> 04:44.625
where Mylius-Erichsen left
his final records of the unknown land.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.541
What's a cairn?

04:46.625 --> 04:49.541
A cairn's a stack of stones
you can see from far away.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.375
So, therefore,
I'll attempt another journey.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.500
[man 2] What?

04:53.583 --> 04:54.541
[Poulsen] Another?

04:55.416 --> 04:57.833
Well, this time further,
across the ice cap,

04:57.916 --> 05:00.125
to retrieve the findings they left behind.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.583
We're not going home then?

05:02.666 --> 05:03.833
[sighs]

05:03.916 --> 05:05.500
This is why we're here, boys.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.583
Without these findings,
the North of Greenland could be lost,

05:08.666 --> 05:09.958
claimed by the Americans.

05:11.416 --> 05:15.000
Now, Jørgensen is incapacitated,

05:15.083 --> 05:16.500
and I can't do it alone,

05:17.083 --> 05:21.166
which provides one of you lucky boys
with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.583
I'll need a volunteer to accompany me.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.333
[dogs barking]

05:55.458 --> 05:57.083
Has anyone volunteered yet?

05:59.916 --> 06:01.000
You're kidding, right?

06:01.083 --> 06:02.666
Jørgensen's feet were wrecked.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.541
[Poulsen] Aren't you next in line, Laub?

06:04.625 --> 06:07.083
Shut up, Poulsen. Some of us have family.

06:08.541 --> 06:10.791
Why don't any of you want to go with him?

06:10.875 --> 06:12.000
You saw the map.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.458
It's like walking from Moscow to Rome
looking for a stack of stones.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.125
[Poulsen] Not to mention
doing it with the captain.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.708
Iver knows him all right.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.750
He knew all about him
before he came aboard, right?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.625
I mean, I've read about him,

06:25.458 --> 06:27.291
but everybody has, haven't they?

06:27.375 --> 06:29.291
[scoffs] Not everyone's a fan,

06:29.375 --> 06:30.666
Iver Iversen.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.583
-Not everyone can read. Right, Unger?
-Try reading this!

06:34.250 --> 06:35.416
[mocking cheers]

06:35.500 --> 06:36.666
[laughter]

06:37.541 --> 06:38.458
[Poulsen] Come on!

06:52.791 --> 06:53.625
Captain.

06:54.875 --> 06:55.708
Mm.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.125
I was…

06:58.625 --> 06:59.541
just wondering…

07:02.750 --> 07:03.583
[hesitates]

07:03.666 --> 07:06.083
I don't know
how many volunteers you've had already--

07:06.166 --> 07:07.416
Well, that would be none.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.541
[clears throat] What I'm trying to say is

07:11.125 --> 07:13.000
technically, I'm out of a job.

07:13.083 --> 07:13.916
Mm-hm.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.041
As long as we're parked up here,
the motor won't be needed.

07:18.208 --> 07:21.125
I'd like to come with you,
if you'd allow me.

07:22.125 --> 07:25.541
I'm good with a rifle,
and I'm learning how to drive the dogs.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.791
I'd really like to come, Captain.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.708
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Iversen.

07:41.416 --> 07:42.458
Thank you, Captain.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.416
[Laub] Poulsen, hand me those harnesses.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.541
-What's Iversen up to?
-[Iver] Come on.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.833
-Looks like he needs a hand.
-[Iver] Stay there.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.583
Hey! Hey!

08:02.416 --> 08:04.000
All of you stay here, okay?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.375
[dogs yap]

08:06.666 --> 08:07.500
[Iver] Okay.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.208
Hey! Hey!

08:10.291 --> 08:11.125
Hey, stop!

08:11.208 --> 08:12.333
Stay there!

08:12.416 --> 08:14.208
-You talk to him.
-[Iver] Hey!

08:15.708 --> 08:17.416
Here, let me give you a hand.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.208
Iversen, the dogs work for you.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.375
Remember that.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.541
Out on the ice,

08:26.625 --> 08:30.666
each dog can pull
a hundred pounds of weight from the start.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.875
Once that hundred pounds has been eaten,

08:33.375 --> 08:37.208
well, that dog
becomes surplus to requirement.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.791
So we shoot the worst dog,

08:41.458 --> 08:42.708
feed it to the others.

08:45.541 --> 08:48.541
So, Iversen, don't become best friends.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.791
You've heard Iversen volunteered.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.500
-[Laub] I have, sir.
-What are your thoughts on him?

08:58.083 --> 08:59.458
-Iversen?
-Yeah.

08:59.541 --> 09:00.875
Uh…

09:00.958 --> 09:01.958
He's a good lad.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.666
-Very brave.
-Mm.

09:03.750 --> 09:04.750
Strong character.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.500
Have you seen him with the dogs?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.833
Clearly he needs
to work a bit harder to improve.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.791
But you think he can do it?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.166
I believe so, yes.

09:20.875 --> 09:21.708
That's all.

09:23.208 --> 09:24.125
[record playing]

09:24.208 --> 09:27.125
[Unger] Don't be ridiculous.
Surely that's too heavy.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.916
I'm telling you, it's unsinkable.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.750
They've spent $1 million already.

09:30.833 --> 09:34.291
It's got combination turbines
and reciprocating engines

09:34.375 --> 09:37.208
guaranteed to maintain
a speed of 21 knots.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.458
-Translation, anyone, please?
-[man 1] What are you talking about?

09:40.541 --> 09:42.416
[Laub] Is the Alabama
not up to your standard?

09:42.500 --> 09:46.333
Go on about this with the captain,
he'll put a bullet in your head.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.708
Yeah, usually I'd say
Poulsen's talking shit,

09:48.791 --> 09:51.500
but I've gotta agree,
I daren't say two words to him.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.541
[chuckles] The captain's not that bad.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.583
[crew laughs]

09:56.291 --> 09:58.625
I have to say, Iver,
I think you've lost your mind.

09:59.125 --> 10:02.541
What do you know about sledging,
surviving on the ice when it's 40 below?

10:03.125 --> 10:06.083
Yeah, and polar bears
and all that other scary shit out there.

10:06.166 --> 10:09.416
I think Iver has got quite the handle
on those dogs now.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.166
It's not too late to change your mind.

10:12.250 --> 10:16.041
This is my third trip up here
and I still hate those fucking dogs.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.625
If they were any more inbred,
they'd be sandwiches.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.541
-[laughter]
-No, come on. They're amazing.

10:21.625 --> 10:25.083
Once you learn to trust your lead dog,
it kind of falls into place.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.250
Mine's Bjørn.
He keeps the others in check.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.708
He does all the work.

10:28.791 --> 10:29.666
Ooh!

10:29.750 --> 10:32.083
Check out Iver
and his new favorite dog, Bjørn!

10:32.166 --> 10:34.083
[laughs]

10:35.083 --> 10:35.958
[Jørgensen sighs]

10:38.041 --> 10:39.666
I feel like I've let you down.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.416
Ah.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.125
You need to get yourself right.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.833
Besides, Iversen's stepped up.

10:48.708 --> 10:49.541
What?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.375
He's a mechanic.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.750
He wouldn't even be on this trip
if our engine hadn't failed in Reykjavik.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.208
Just look after Alabama for me.

11:02.625 --> 11:03.916
I've got to say this.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.083
You're not a young man anymore.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.791
You're risking your life, Iversen's life.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.916
You want us to give up without trying?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.166
We did try.

11:13.916 --> 11:14.916
We did our best.

11:15.000 --> 11:15.958
Nonsense.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.875
What about Naja?

11:21.333 --> 11:23.125
Do you expect her to wait for you?

11:24.833 --> 11:27.833
-You've got nothing to prove.
-This is not about me.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.458
The committee's instructions were clear.

11:31.541 --> 11:33.250
The sea opens up by July.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.583
If we're not back by August
before the sea freezes, then you go.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.625
-You'll basically be on your own.
-That's an order.

11:42.208 --> 11:45.666
Iversen is the best, if not the only, man
willing to make the trip.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.375
I respect your concern,
but we are leaving tomorrow.

11:51.708 --> 11:52.708
Yes, Captain.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.250
[Laub] Iver, stand closer to the captain.

12:44.041 --> 12:44.958
Yep, that's it.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.250
Three, two, one.

12:51.166 --> 12:52.750
[chuckles] Excellent.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.500
[laughter]

12:55.916 --> 12:57.000
[Laub] Thanks for that.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.250
-Good luck.
-[Iver] Thank you.

12:59.375 --> 13:00.375
Thank you.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.833
I'll see you in August.

13:02.583 --> 13:03.791
Take care, lads!

13:03.875 --> 13:05.958
-[Poulsen] You too, Captain.
-[Unger] All the best.

13:07.083 --> 13:07.916
Good luck.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.333
Thank you, Jørgensen. Thank you.

13:10.416 --> 13:12.416
[dogs barking]

13:13.041 --> 13:14.416
[shouts] Hup!

13:14.500 --> 13:15.625
Good luck, Captain.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.208
[Iver] Go on, boys!

13:17.708 --> 13:19.083
[Laub] Good luck, Iver!

13:19.166 --> 13:20.500
He's going to need it.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.083
[Iver geeing up dogs]

13:40.166 --> 13:41.250
Iversen!

13:44.041 --> 13:45.000
Get behind.

-Are we gonna try and get up there?
-Well, there's always a way up.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.500
It's just finding the quickest route.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.041
I bet there's a quick way down too.

Very interesting.

16:12.541 --> 16:16.083
They had so much equipment, didn't they?
They even had an automobile.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.958
Imagine that! Driving across the ice.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.291
It's ridiculous.

back when you joined us in Reykjavik?

separated by a channel

32:33.791 --> 32:34.916
Come on, Iversen!

32:47.833 --> 32:49.333
Whoa! Whoa!

32:50.416 --> 32:51.291
Whoa.

32:52.125 --> 32:52.958
[pants]

33:05.708 --> 33:07.708
[hammering]

33:20.583 --> 33:26.125
Now, we have a slight course correction
we need to make.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.166
-Captain.
-Yes, Iversen?

33:40.541 --> 33:41.750
Well, speak up, man.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.708
Well, we have no supplies.

33:47.916 --> 33:49.916
Is there a point where perhaps we…

33:50.958 --> 33:52.125
Where we what?

33:53.666 --> 33:56.458
-Accept that--
-Accept defeat, Iversen?

33:56.541 --> 33:57.666
Do you wanna give up?

33:58.458 --> 33:59.625
It's too tough?

34:00.833 --> 34:02.125
Missing home?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.958
No, Captain. That's--

34:04.041 --> 34:05.958
We have a map. We will find it.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.291
We won't find it
by standing around talking.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.208
Yes, but--

34:09.291 --> 34:12.166
And we will be back
on the Alabama by August.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.125
We're going down to one sledge.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.083
Iversen.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.041
-Mm?
-Iversen, look.

34:53.541 --> 34:54.458
What?

34:59.833 --> 35:00.916
That's a cairn.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.666
[Iver] I think you're right!

35:15.500 --> 35:17.583
Captain, they were here.

35:20.583 --> 35:21.833
They were here, Captain!

35:22.541 --> 35:23.458
This is a camp.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.041
[sniffs]

35:46.500 --> 35:47.416
Pemmican.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.916
-And oxtail soup, look.
-Wait.

36:12.666 --> 36:14.375
"August 8th, 1907."

36:15.291 --> 36:17.791
"Being without food
for ourselves and our dogs,

36:17.875 --> 36:21.833
we must leave this place and try to make
our way to coastal areas with game,

36:22.500 --> 36:25.416
enough to sledge
the 580 miles back to the ship."

36:26.500 --> 36:29.541
They had no food, Captain,
but they left this.

36:30.125 --> 36:32.416
"We discovered
and leave a proof in this cairn

36:32.500 --> 36:34.333
that Peary Channel does not exist."

36:35.500 --> 36:38.291
"Navy Cliff is joined by land
to Heilprin Land,

36:38.375 --> 36:40.500
therefore our work is almost done."

36:40.583 --> 36:44.291
"We hope to reach the ship before the end
of September, with or without dogs."

36:47.166 --> 36:48.875
"Lieutenant Mylius-Erichsen,

36:49.375 --> 36:52.125
leader of Denmark Expedition
to Northeast Greenland."

37:05.166 --> 37:07.500
Robert Peary and the Americans were wrong.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.125
This is it.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.083
This is it.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.333
This is why we came.

37:18.791 --> 37:20.166
It's beautiful, isn't it?

37:20.958 --> 37:21.833
[chuckles]

37:23.333 --> 37:24.541
-Beautiful.
-[laughs]

37:24.625 --> 37:28.333
I don't really understand
why what we found is so important,

37:28.416 --> 37:31.916
but seeing you smile, Captain,
seeing you laugh…

37:35.875 --> 37:37.083
Greenland is one.

37:37.791 --> 37:39.625
The USA has no claim here.

37:41.708 --> 37:44.083
Denmark will thank you
one day, Iver Iversen.

37:47.041 --> 37:49.541
It's time to celebrate.
Now you put that soup on.

37:58.625 --> 37:59.500
[Ejnar] Mm.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.375
[sighs]

38:05.333 --> 38:07.000
We can go home now, Iversen.

38:07.083 --> 38:07.916
[chuckles]

38:09.500 --> 38:12.625
Like walking from Rome to Moscow
looking for a stack of stones.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.916
[laughs]

38:14.875 --> 38:15.791
What was that?

38:18.541 --> 38:20.458
That's what the guys were saying
on the ship.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.500
Well, you can put them straight now.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.125
Home, to Alabama.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.416
And then home sweet home.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.416
-[dog barks]
-[grunts]

39:25.583 --> 39:26.791
[Iver grunts]

39:27.541 --> 39:28.625
[bone cracks]

39:31.916 --> 39:32.833
[grunts]

39:35.875 --> 39:36.708
[pants]

39:44.291 --> 39:46.000
Do you think we could eat the liver?

39:47.041 --> 39:48.375
The rest is skin and bone.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.375
Wouldn't that be poisonous?

39:55.500 --> 39:57.083
Because it died of exhaustion?

40:03.583 --> 40:04.958
Oh, we shouldn't risk it.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.708
But what's that thing

40:11.500 --> 40:15.208
about a silver spoon
in a pot with anything poisonous?

40:16.416 --> 40:17.500
Changes color.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.416
Exactly.

40:20.416 --> 40:22.208
Shame we don't have any silver.

40:32.375 --> 40:33.625
You have silver?

40:34.208 --> 40:35.166
That I do.

40:41.125 --> 40:41.958
What?

40:44.250 --> 40:45.333
What is it?

40:45.416 --> 40:47.375
You said you didn't have anyone back home.

40:48.791 --> 40:49.958
You traveled light.

40:52.875 --> 40:53.958
It was a present.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.500
All right, let's do it.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.208
[flame crackles]

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
[Iver] What should it be?

41:07.250 --> 41:10.291
-I don't remember.
-No, I don't remember either.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.791
Should it go green?

41:13.875 --> 41:15.000
If it's poisonous?

41:15.500 --> 41:16.833
Yeah. I think so.

41:16.916 --> 41:18.208
Sounds about right.

41:23.458 --> 41:27.166
-That's… not green.
-That's more brown than green.

41:28.625 --> 41:29.958
It's definitely not green.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.250
[Iver groans, coughs]

41:56.875 --> 41:57.750
[Iver retches]

42:00.250 --> 42:01.083

[breathing heavily]

43:39.000 --> 43:41.125
[dogs snarling]

43:41.208 --> 43:42.291

43:54.250 --> 43:56.000

[gasping for air]

45:00.416 --> 45:01.250
Captain!

45:01.333 --> 45:02.458
Give me your hand!

45:08.375 --> 45:09.625
[coughs]

45:11.500 --> 45:14.041
[gasping]

45:14.125 --> 45:15.791
You're okay. You're okay!

45:15.875 --> 45:16.708
I've got it.

45:16.791 --> 45:17.916
[heavy breathing]

45:18.000 --> 45:18.875
[Iver] It's okay.

45:29.750 --> 45:33.041
I can't believe
this was the only thing that got torn.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.958
Right.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.041
That should do it.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.208
Warm enough, Captain?

45:50.125 --> 45:52.083
Losing two dogs like that.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.250
[whimpers]

45:58.416 --> 45:59.708
That was our chance.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.500
-What?
-The bear.

46:04.250 --> 46:05.375
Just like us.

46:06.750 --> 46:07.791
Hungry for meat.

46:18.916 --> 46:19.833
I miss them.

46:21.375 --> 46:22.208
Who?

46:23.583 --> 46:24.541
Women.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.041
Me too.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.833
[chuckles] Not like that.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.500
Their company, female company.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.750
[sighs] They're different, aren't they?

46:34.833 --> 46:36.375
Their voices, their smell.

46:37.625 --> 46:39.125
I do miss their laughter.

46:41.375 --> 46:44.208
I remember when I was 16,
about to join the Navy,

46:45.041 --> 46:49.708
my grandfather asked
if I'd go with him to Copenhagen Harbor.

46:50.625 --> 46:53.458
I thought we were going to look at ships,
so I went along,

46:54.958 --> 46:57.083
even packing a lunch for the two of us,

46:58.125 --> 46:59.500
but he had other plans.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.875
He wanted to make sure
I was ready to set sail

47:04.708 --> 47:06.250
and, in his words, "be a man."

47:07.750 --> 47:09.708
So he took me to the red-light district

47:09.791 --> 47:11.291
to introduce me to women,

47:12.041 --> 47:14.250
make sure I wasn't embarrassed
on my travels.

47:16.125 --> 47:18.041
[chuckles] I just went along with it.

47:18.666 --> 47:21.333
Ended up with this older woman.

47:24.333 --> 47:25.458
I must admit,

47:26.000 --> 47:27.875
she did expand my knowledge greatly.

47:28.666 --> 47:29.500
[chuckles]

47:30.625 --> 47:32.125
When I was 16,

47:32.208 --> 47:34.291
my dad took me to the hospital,

47:35.875 --> 47:38.166
to the venereal-disease ward,

47:39.791 --> 47:44.250
to show me the dire consequences
of such behavior.

47:47.333 --> 47:48.666
It was fucking disgusting.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
[chuckles softly]

47:54.125 --> 47:55.625
[dog whimpers]

48:04.041 --> 48:04.916

48:31.208 --> 48:32.041
Captain?

48:35.500 --> 48:37.166
-[grunts]
-What are you doing?

48:41.375 --> 48:43.833
Captain. Captain, stop. Stop!

48:43.916 --> 48:45.791
What are you doing? Stop.

48:47.291 --> 48:48.333
What are you doing?

48:50.125 --> 48:52.458
We have to travel light
if we're gonna make it.

48:54.250 --> 48:56.750
We'll leave everything
that's not absolutely vital.

48:57.708 --> 48:59.666
There's another 200 miles to the ship.

50:02.375 --> 50:04.375
[panting]

50:12.750 --> 50:13.583
[sighs wearily]

50:43.625 --> 50:44.750
We need to cross here.

50:50.750 --> 50:51.583
What?

50:55.541 --> 50:58.166
-Why can't we go around?
-We won't have time.

51:00.833 --> 51:02.166
We need to build a cairn.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.458
You don't think we can make it, do you?

51:08.166 --> 51:10.750
If we don't, we lose everything.

51:17.791 --> 51:22.666
[Ejnar] At least if the proof
and our journals are kept here in a cairn,

51:22.750 --> 51:24.125
they can be found.

51:35.541 --> 51:36.375
Good.

51:40.125 --> 51:40.958
Iversen.

51:41.791 --> 51:42.708
We can do this.

51:47.916 --> 51:50.291
This is what happened
to Mylius-Erichsen, isn't it?

51:53.250 --> 51:54.083
Let's go.

52:29.083 --> 52:29.958
[groans]

52:31.500 --> 52:32.458
[Ejnar] What is it?

52:33.125 --> 52:34.041
[wearily] Nothing.

52:35.041 --> 52:37.291
I just need to lie down for a second.

52:38.125 --> 52:39.916
-Get up. Come on.
-[groans]

52:41.541 --> 52:43.250
[breathless] Come on. Get up.

52:43.875 --> 52:45.500
-[Iver grunts]
-Get up.

52:49.458 --> 52:50.333
[Iver groans]

52:51.041 --> 52:52.500
[panting]

53:15.250 --> 53:16.083
[exclaims]

53:17.041 --> 53:17.875
Look.

53:17.958 --> 53:20.166
[wearily] That's the Alabama!

53:20.875 --> 53:22.500
-We're back!
-We're back!

53:22.583 --> 53:23.541
We're back!

53:24.166 --> 53:25.708
The wayfarers are back!

53:26.291 --> 53:27.875
[Iver] Sound the bell!

53:27.958 --> 53:29.708
-[Ejnar laughs]
-Sound the bell!

53:33.166 --> 53:34.708
[panting]

53:34.791 --> 53:36.000
-It's on land.
-What?

53:36.083 --> 53:38.208
The mast, it's on land.

53:40.833 --> 53:42.041
But where's my ship?

53:44.916 --> 53:45.750
I don't know.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.833
They've built a hut
with parts of the ship.

54:14.000 --> 54:14.833
Hello?

54:16.666 --> 54:17.583
Hello?

54:18.875 --> 54:20.708
-Hello?
-Hello?

54:29.750 --> 54:30.583
[Iver sobs]

54:31.250 --> 54:35.291
No, they've left us! They've left us!

54:36.208 --> 54:38.208
No! No!

54:38.291 --> 54:40.791
[desperately] No, no!

54:44.625 --> 54:46.125
You just left?

54:46.875 --> 54:48.208
We had no choice, sir.

54:48.291 --> 54:51.291
The Alabama was wrecked,
crushed by the ice.

54:51.375 --> 54:53.583
We had to leave when we had the chance.

54:54.083 --> 54:56.375
We left enough food
to last at least a year.

54:56.458 --> 55:00.166
-[official] Let's pray they make it back.

to the Arctic, is it?

55:09.625 --> 55:11.208
No, sir. It was my fourth.

55:11.291 --> 55:12.791
And Lieutenant Jørgensen?

55:12.875 --> 55:14.083
My fourth also.

55:14.583 --> 55:17.000
And who is this man, Iver Iversen?

55:19.875 --> 55:21.000
Our mechanic, sir.

55:23.666 --> 55:25.958
His name is not on the original crew list.

55:26.041 --> 55:29.041
[official] No.
He joined Alabama in Reykjavik.

55:29.125 --> 55:30.000
Mm-hm.

And how come a mechanic
is chosen to accompany Mikkelsen

55:34.916 --> 55:36.541

55:39.666 --> 55:41.250
-[minister] Hm?
-He volunteered.

55:42.291 --> 55:43.625
Volunteered. Hm…

55:45.166 --> 55:47.666
Did he have any experience
as an Arctic explorer?

55:49.083 --> 55:49.958
No, sir.

55:50.916 --> 55:53.458
This was his first time in the Arctic.

55:53.541 --> 55:58.333
So, three dead men the first time around
and now two more on the rescue attempt.

55:58.416 --> 56:00.416
Sir, there's no proof that they're--

56:00.500 --> 56:01.333
[scoffs] Proof!

56:01.416 --> 56:03.166
Nobody brings home any proof.

56:03.666 --> 56:07.083
Now, you two both knew
that the chances of success were minimal.

56:07.166 --> 56:10.208
Even less so
when you allow an inexperienced greenhorn

56:10.291 --> 56:12.541

56:14.500 --> 56:19.208

on another fruitless mission.

to waste government funds.

56:21.958 --> 56:22.791
Sir!

56:24.583 --> 56:26.333

56:26.916 --> 56:29.666

59:22.916 --> 59:27.208

to catch the train back to Copenhagen.

1:33:45.875 --> 1:33:46.750
You're safe.

1:33:52.458 --> 1:33:53.500
It's okay.

1:33:54.166 --> 1:33:55.750
You're going home now.

1:34:05.291 --> 1:34:07.291
[morse code beeping]

1:34:20.250 --> 1:34:24.375
[Neergaard] What is the single
most important task for an explorer?

1:34:26.041 --> 1:34:30.875
When you travel into unknown lands
to discover new parts of the globe,

1:34:32.125 --> 1:34:36.125
it is to ensure the records
of your discoveries

1:34:36.208 --> 1:34:39.083
are delivered back safe and sound,

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:42.416
with or without you.

1:34:43.291 --> 1:34:46.000
Otherwise, it is all in vain.

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:51.833
The blood, sweat and tears
would all be for nothing.

1:34:53.166 --> 1:34:56.708
Unlike the honorable members
of the Danish press,

1:34:56.791 --> 1:35:00.500
we in the Danish government
never doubted for a second

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:04.250
that Captain Mikkelsen
would return home safe and sound.

1:35:06.125 --> 1:35:12.041
We played our part in ensuring
the safe return of a Danish hero.

1:35:12.125 --> 1:35:14.291
[applause]

1:35:14.375 --> 1:35:15.833
So many people in there.

1:35:15.916 --> 1:35:16.750
Mm.

1:35:20.083 --> 1:35:21.500
You know that ship,

1:35:22.416 --> 1:35:23.375
the Titanic?

1:35:23.458 --> 1:35:24.291
Mm.

1:35:25.833 --> 1:35:27.166
It only went and sunk.

1:35:29.583 --> 1:35:31.541
-You wanted to work on that.
-[chuckles]

1:35:33.666 --> 1:35:34.541
Lucky.

1:35:36.041 --> 1:35:37.500
I've always been lucky, me.

1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:39.333
No.

1:35:41.458 --> 1:35:42.541
I'm the lucky one.

1:35:45.250 --> 1:35:47.500
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you.

1:35:47.583 --> 1:35:50.083
[Neergaard] …which leads me to read…

1:35:50.166 --> 1:35:51.166
Thank you, Iver.

1:35:52.583 --> 1:35:57.333
"Based on the findings brought back
by Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen,

1:35:58.250 --> 1:36:00.791
the United States hereby acknowledge

1:36:00.875 --> 1:36:04.916
that Peary Land is not an island,

1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.041
but a part of Greenland."

1:36:07.541 --> 1:36:10.250
[applause]

1:36:21.208 --> 1:36:24.625
[Neergaard] "The United States
of America lay no claim…"

1:36:24.708 --> 1:36:25.541
[Ejnar] Iver.

1:36:26.625 --> 1:36:29.000
-Yeah?
-Is there a woman standing there?

1:36:29.916 --> 1:36:30.750
Yes.

1:36:32.208 --> 1:36:33.666
[applause]

1:36:37.083 --> 1:36:38.250
Captain…

1:36:40.666 --> 1:36:41.500
Captain.

1:36:53.791 --> 1:36:54.791
[Iver] Captain.

1:36:58.583 --> 1:36:59.708
[Iver clears throat]

1:37:01.041 --> 1:37:04.541
-[Neergaard] It gives me great pleasure…
-Congratulations, gentlemen.

1:37:05.375 --> 1:37:06.375
Thank you.

1:37:07.166 --> 1:37:09.791
…to be the first person to welcome home

1:37:09.875 --> 1:37:13.375
the men who made the impossible possible.

1:37:13.458 --> 1:37:15.333
Um…

1:37:15.416 --> 1:37:16.375
This is Iver.

1:37:16.458 --> 1:37:17.500
Iver Iversen.

1:37:17.583 --> 1:37:19.666
-It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss…
-Holm.

1:37:19.750 --> 1:37:20.666
Naja Holm.

1:37:21.791 --> 1:37:23.791
[applause]

1:37:28.458 --> 1:37:31.041
It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Holm.

1:37:31.125 --> 1:37:31.958
And you.

1:37:32.750 --> 1:37:35.791
Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen

1:37:35.875 --> 1:37:38.041
and Iver Iversen.

1:37:38.125 --> 1:37:39.833
Go. They're waiting for you.

1:37:44.291 --> 1:37:46.750
[chuckles] They have returned,
I promise you!

1:37:46.833 --> 1:37:49.125
[audience laughs]

1:38:08.291 --> 1:38:10.958
-Minister. Iver Iversen.
-Thank you, sir.

1:38:11.041 --> 1:38:13.541
[audience cheers]

1:38:13.625 --> 1:38:15.625
[applause continues]
