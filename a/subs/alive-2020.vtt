<i>Hello!</i>

02:30.024 --> 02:31.359
<i>Are we rushing the school?</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:35.446
We'll go to the bunker
and farm for three minutes,

02:35.530 --> 02:37.532
then run to the location I ping.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.201
<i>-Okay, sounds good.</i>
-<i>What's that?</i>

02:40.285 --> 02:41.661
-What?
<i>-OMG. Is that for real?</i>

02:41.744 --> 02:43.913
<i>-Turn on the TV.</i>
<i>-Isn't that computer graphics?</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:45.665
-What's on TV?
-<i>It's like a movie.</i>

02:53.631 --> 02:58.553

<i>ruthlessly violent,</i>

03:11.274 --> 03:15.278
<i>This phenomenon, which began</i>
<i>as a small riot in the Gangbuk District,</i>

03:15.361 --> 03:17.488
<i>is spreading rapidly.</i>

03:17.572 --> 03:21.284
<i>It seems to have already moved</i>
<i>beyond Seoul, reaching a national scale.</i>

03:21.826 --> 03:25.997
<i>The government is currently considering</i>

Mom, where are you?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.295
Mom!

06:19.629 --> 06:21.839
You know me, right? We've met before.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.133
Your next-door neighbor. Unit 403.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.303
I don't care. Just get the hell out.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.680
No, don't!

Something's not right.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.155
You're alone here, right?

06:47.448 --> 06:48.282
Yes.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.369
At my place just now,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.163
my brother suddenly...

06:55.081 --> 06:55.915
My brother...

07:03.381 --> 07:07.051
Look, I don't know
what's going on right now.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.013
But what happened at your place
is none of my business.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.016
-If there's a problem, call the police.
-No, wait.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.727
You really don't know?
You didn't see anything outside?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.396
You really don't know anything?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.607
-The cops and the people--
-Get out! I said, get out!

07:21.691 --> 07:22.817
Wait! Just wait.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.235
Hold on. Then...

07:25.361 --> 07:26.988
Just let me use your bathroom.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.829
Then leave as soon as you're done.

07:35.913 --> 07:36.747
Thank you.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.588
<i>We apologize for the interruption.</i>

07:43.671 --> 07:46.799

<i>an unstable network connection.</i>

07:46.883 --> 07:48.342
<i>I repeat.</i>

07:48.426 --> 07:51.512
<i>Due to the rapid spread of the infection</i>
<i>in densely populated areas,</i>

07:51.596 --> 07:55.224
<i>the situation in major cities</i>
<i>has become uncontrollable.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:58.728
<i>Infected individuals are known</i>
<i>to become suddenly violent,</i>

07:58.811 --> 08:01.772
<i>and main symptoms of the infection</i>

<i>Not only do they attack</i>
<i>innocent civilians,</i>

<i>but they also exhibit</i>
<i>cannibalistic behavior.</i>

08:21.792 --> 08:24.754
<i>The KCDC has stated</i>
<i>that a bite from an infected individual…</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:27.006
<i>In other words, a bite or stab wound--</i>

Hey, no. Hold on! Hey.

Hey! Jeez. Look.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.522
Just don't kick me out, okay?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.983
You said you'd leave
after using the bathroom.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.736
-Get out.
-An hour, then.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.322
Let me stay here for an hour. Please?

08:51.989 --> 08:54.617
Hey, what happened to your hand?

08:55.868 --> 08:58.079
Oh, it's nothing.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.580
It's nothing.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.123
I didn't do this.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.375
No!

09:02.708 --> 09:06.045
No...

09:12.009 --> 09:13.803
No, no way. No!

09:21.561 --> 09:23.104
Hey, I told you to leave.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.481

<i>Other than the infected exhibiting</i>

14:34.707 --> 14:36.292
<i>we are not certain of anything.</i>

14:36.375 --> 14:39.962
<i>However, it seems</i>
<i>that the extreme aggressive tendencies</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:44.216
<i>and cannibalistic acts</i>
<i>have more to do with the brain.</i>

14:44.300 --> 14:47.219
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>this could be a type of mental illness?</i>

14:47.678 --> 14:50.264
<i>And not an infectious disease at all?</i>

14:50.347 --> 14:52.683
<i>-Your call cannot be</i>
<i>-The most likely cause</i>

14:52.766 --> 14:55.644
<i>-connected to voicemail.</i>
<i>-may be from a virus mutation.</i>

<i>However, the aggressive</i>
<i>and cannibalistic tendencies</i>

14:59.273 --> 15:01.400
<i>that are brought out after being infected</i>

15:01.483 --> 15:03.777
<i>seem to be connected to the brain.</i>

15:04.403 --> 15:06.739
<i>The mutated virus</i>

<i>from before they were infected.</i>

32:14.891 --> 32:16.142
<i>-Close the door!</i>
<i>-Go away!</i>

32:16.225 --> 32:18.144
<i>Come here. I said, come here!</i>

32:18.227 --> 32:19.729
<i>Hide by the window. Go!</i>

32:19.812 --> 32:20.647
<i>Jun-hui!</i>

32:20.730 --> 32:23.149
<i>-They'll get you! Go!</i>
<i>-No!</i>

32:23.232 --> 32:25.860
<i>Honey, don't let go of my hand. Honey!</i>

32:27.153 --> 32:29.155
<i>Honey! What do we do?</i>

32:29.238 --> 32:30.740
<i>Jun-hui!</i>

32:30.823 --> 32:31.991
<i>Help!</i>

32:32.283 --> 32:33.785
<i>Help me!</i>

32:58.977 --> 32:59.978
Fuck!

33:00.728 --> 33:03.231
Damn you motherfuckers!

33:04.107 --> 33:05.400
Come out!

33:08.111 --> 33:09.153
Come out!

33:10.488 --> 33:12.156
Come on out!

33:16.786 --> 33:17.620
Fuck it.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.565
What?

33:47.483 --> 33:49.027
What the fuck do you want?

33:50.153 --> 33:51.696
Help!

33:53.197 --> 33:54.032
Please!

33:54.115 --> 33:55.616
Please help me.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.818
DAY 20

37:47.848 --> 37:48.683
<i>Hello...</i>

37:57.233 --> 37:58.067
<i>Bye.</i>

39:08.220 --> 39:10.473
HELLO

39:25.112 --> 39:26.113
<i>"Ba...</i>

39:27.907 --> 39:28.741
<i>bo?"</i>

39:30.826 --> 39:31.702
As in idiot?

39:39.418 --> 39:40.503
Yes, you idiot.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.109
What?

40:18.791 --> 40:20.584
Five?<i> </i>Two?

40:25.005 --> 40:25.881
Seven o'clock.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.342
Seven o'clock?

40:28.426 --> 40:29.260
Yes.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.805
Hush.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.215
DAY 3, DAY 4, DAY 5, DAY 6, DAY 7

43:07.376 --> 43:08.210
Hold on.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.635
OH JUN-U

43:30.441 --> 43:33.110
KIM YU-BIN

43:33.193 --> 43:34.737
Kim Yu-bin.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.533
Kim Yu-bin.

43:43.412 --> 43:44.246
Ms. Kim Yu-bin.

43:45.497 --> 43:46.665
Yu-bin?

43:53.005 --> 43:54.757
Could he really be an idiot?

43:56.050 --> 43:57.843
Damn it, you loser.

44:03.766 --> 44:04.725
No.

44:06.935 --> 44:07.895
What's he doing?

44:18.447 --> 44:19.865
No, wait. Don't go!

44:37.508 --> 44:39.093
Yes, seven o'clock.

45:53.375 --> 45:54.334
The eighth floor.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.215
The eighth floor.

46:41.006 --> 46:41.965
No, I'm okay.

46:46.178 --> 46:47.137
Are you hungry?

46:49.389 --> 46:50.390
Yes.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.077
EAT SLOWLY!

48:39.374 --> 48:41.084
He shouldn't eat so fast.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.086
911 EMERGENCY SERVICES

50:46.251 --> 50:47.544
Fine, bring it on.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.094
No.

52:12.379 --> 52:14.923
STAY STRONG!

52:26.852 --> 52:27.686
Gosh...

52:29.104 --> 52:30.730
How can I survive on just these?

52:33.191 --> 52:35.610
I MUST SURVIVE

52:37.112 --> 52:38.697
Oh Jun-u, you can do it.

52:40.365 --> 52:41.741
Oh Jun-u, you got this.

52:48.248 --> 52:50.041
Let's go do some farming.

53:32.250 --> 53:33.585
Jeez.

57:02.043 --> 57:03.253
Get off me, fucker!

57:03.336 --> 57:04.170
Get off me!

57:55.889 --> 57:56.723
Damn.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.750
<i>Hello?</i>

58:24.959 --> 58:27.253
<i>Hello? Anybody there?</i>

58:27.921 --> 58:29.464
Crap.<i> </i>Jeez.

58:30.006 --> 58:30.840
Hello?

58:31.925 --> 58:33.468
<i>Are you still sleeping?</i>

58:33.927 --> 58:35.553
Can you hear me? Hello?

58:37.180 --> 58:38.556
Yes, I can hear you.

58:39.432 --> 58:41.809
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Yes, hello!

58:42.727 --> 58:44.103
Hush, lower your voice.

58:45.271 --> 58:47.106
Oh, right. Yes.

58:48.566 --> 58:49.567
I'm just...

58:50.318 --> 58:52.737
I'm just so excited.
I mean, this is so cool!

58:52.820 --> 58:55.031
You don't have to whisper, you know.

58:55.740 --> 58:56.699
Oh, right.

58:57.992 --> 58:59.827
-That bag.
-<i>What?</i>

58:59.911 --> 59:00.745
<i>The...</i>

59:00.828 --> 59:02.288
<i>Nutella.</i>

59:02.372 --> 59:04.624
-Can you hear me?
-<i>Nutella.</i>

59:05.416 --> 59:06.960
Hello?

59:07.293 --> 59:08.127
Hello?

59:09.337 --> 59:12.006
-Don't press the button while I'm talking.
-What?

59:13.424 --> 59:14.342
The walkie-talkie.

59:15.260 --> 59:17.345
<i>Don't press the button when I'm talking.</i>

59:20.390 --> 59:22.517
Right, I know. I'm not an idiot.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.144
Thanks for the food.

59:26.646 --> 59:27.480
Sure.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.650
Well, do you like Nutella?

59:37.824 --> 59:38.658
It's okay.

59:39.742 --> 59:41.536
What? Why did I give it to her, then?

59:43.621 --> 59:44.706
<i>I heard that.</i>

59:46.291 --> 59:47.458
God, I'm such an idiot.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.712
I can still hear you, you know.

59:57.552 --> 1:00:00.555
Thanks for the delicious food.
I enjoyed it.

1:00:04.183 --> 1:00:05.143
I should thank you.

1:00:05.810 --> 1:00:06.936
For saving me.

1:00:07.937 --> 1:00:09.147
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1:00:13.526 --> 1:00:14.986
I didn't save you.

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:18.990
-Sorry?
-<i>I said, I didn't save you.</i>

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:21.993
You did it because you wanted to live.

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:29.292
You wanted to live.
That's what's keeping you alive.

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:32.170
<i>No, but still...</i>

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:34.255
<i>Without you...</i>

1:00:35.798 --> 1:00:37.133
<i>If I hadn't met you,</i>

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:40.345
<i>I wouldn't be here now.</i>

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:42.680
I nearly died.

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:45.391
No, I was actually going
to take my own life.

1:00:47.518 --> 1:00:51.314
I'm sorry,
but can we talk about something else?

1:00:52.106 --> 1:00:52.940
What?

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:57.111
If you don't mind,

1:00:59.030 --> 1:01:01.783
let's talk about something else.
It can be about anything.

1:01:06.245 --> 1:01:07.664
Do you want some Chapagetti?

1:01:11.709 --> 1:01:13.086
Did you pour out the water?

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:16.047
I only put in a little to begin with.

1:01:16.130 --> 1:01:19.550
You have to control the amount of water
and simmer it down.

1:01:20.051 --> 1:01:20.968
Simmer it down?

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:22.845
If you want to mix it with rice later…

1:01:22.929 --> 1:01:24.597
Who eats Chapagetti like that?

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:27.642
Do you know how to cook instant noodles?

1:01:28.226 --> 1:01:30.436
Who doesn't know
how to cook instant noodles?

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:33.356
You, obviously.

1:01:33.856 --> 1:01:36.442
Why wouldn't she pour out the water?
She's weird.

1:01:42.281 --> 1:01:45.660
Chapagetti tastes the best
when it's mixed with Neoguri.

1:01:45.743 --> 1:01:47.245
Namely, <i>Chapaguri.</i> Right?

1:01:47.578 --> 1:01:50.039
NEOGURI

1:01:53.418 --> 1:01:55.128
That's too much food for me.

1:01:55.878 --> 1:01:57.171
You can't even finish that?

1:02:00.299 --> 1:02:01.300
Eat up.

1:02:01.384 --> 1:02:03.594
Yes, I'm going to.

1:02:06.764 --> 1:02:07.682
Oh my.

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:11.352
I wish I could top it off
with a drizzle of sesame oil.

1:02:19.777 --> 1:02:21.821
-You're scared of heights?
<i>-What?</i>

1:02:22.321 --> 1:02:23.406
What's wrong with it?

1:02:24.615 --> 1:02:27.285
Well, it just doesn't suit you.

1:02:28.870 --> 1:02:32.248
You cut off someone's hand with an ax,
yet you're scared of heights?

1:02:36.335 --> 1:02:38.796
-I never cut off anyone's hand.
-What?

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:40.423
Those monsters are not human.

1:02:41.549 --> 1:02:42.675
Not anymore at least.

1:02:46.262 --> 1:02:47.680
<i>I am afraid of heights.</i>

1:02:48.681 --> 1:02:50.516
I fell while climbing a few years ago.

1:02:51.726 --> 1:02:53.519
Climbing? You mean…

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:57.064
going up a cliff in the mountains
with bare hands, right?

1:02:57.607 --> 1:03:01.986
-Like Tom Cruise in <i>Mission: Impossible!</i>
-Well, I'm not that good.

1:03:05.990 --> 1:03:08.659
Tom Cruise? You sound ancient.

1:03:11.037 --> 1:03:13.998
It's raining! Gather some rainwater.
Get a bowl. No, a pail!

1:03:14.749 --> 1:03:15.583
A pail?

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:27.637
This isn't rain.

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:04.966
Jun-u.

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:27.238
Yu-bin, are you okay?

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.576
They're coming toward my place.

1:04:42.461 --> 1:04:44.088
They're right in front of my place.

1:04:53.681 --> 1:04:55.224
They're outside the door now.

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:00.354
Which unit?

1:05:00.688 --> 1:05:02.064
-What?
-Your unit number.

1:05:39.352 --> 1:05:40.353
Are you ready?

1:05:42.063 --> 1:05:42.980
<i>By the way,</i>

1:05:44.231 --> 1:05:45.650
are you sure no one's there?

1:05:49.862 --> 1:05:50.696
Yes, I'm sure.

1:05:51.155 --> 1:05:53.532
The eighth floor is the only place
that's empty.

1:05:53.824 --> 1:05:56.577
Yu-bin. It's fine…

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:00.957
even if the eighth floor isn't empty.

1:06:01.290 --> 1:06:04.251
Whether we get eaten by them
or starve to death, we'll die anyway.

1:06:07.421 --> 1:06:08.255
<i>Whatever.</i>

1:06:08.798 --> 1:06:09.632
What?

1:06:10.174 --> 1:06:12.343
<i>I'm coming. I'm leaving now.</i>

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:23.312
But not through the door.

1:06:40.538 --> 1:06:41.789
What's she doing?

1:06:45.459 --> 1:06:47.795
Yu-bin. Are you listening?

1:06:50.464 --> 1:06:52.174
Do you think we can survive this?

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:00.433
I'm not sure.

1:07:05.521 --> 1:07:06.647
<i>But I want to.</i>

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:12.153
I really want to live as well.

1:07:14.822 --> 1:07:17.908
I don't want to be bitten to shreds
by those things.

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:21.746
And I'd fucking hate
to be eaten alive by them.

1:07:25.082 --> 1:07:26.417
So we have to survive.

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:28.878
We'll survive together.

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:32.757
All right, then.

1:07:35.217 --> 1:07:36.552
<i>Hey, Yu-bin. Listen up.</i>

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:41.265
I'll get down there first
and distract them. That's your cue.

1:07:42.850 --> 1:07:45.061
One, two.

1:07:45.144 --> 1:07:46.187
After that...

1:07:46.937 --> 1:07:47.772
Three!

1:07:59.825 --> 1:08:01.202
Then you can come down…

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:05.706
Who's she, really?

1:08:24.767 --> 1:08:25.601
Unbelievable.

1:09:02.096 --> 1:09:03.430
Yu-bin!

1:09:03.848 --> 1:09:05.182
Let's go!

1:09:57.318 --> 1:09:59.945
Oh, I see that you're still alive.
Nice to meet you.

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:01.697
Likewise.

1:10:04.867 --> 1:10:05.784
Talking casually?

1:10:07.578 --> 1:10:08.913
You're doing it too.

1:10:10.664 --> 1:10:11.790
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:14.126
<i>Eighth floor.</i>

1:11:36.583 --> 1:11:37.835
Please!

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:49.221
This way!

1:11:50.055 --> 1:11:51.098
Come on! Hurry!

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:14.997
Okay.

1:12:15.456 --> 1:12:17.207
We're good. We're good now.

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:19.251
Jeez, you scared me.

1:12:24.506 --> 1:12:25.507
Guys.

1:12:26.008 --> 1:12:28.927
You don't need to thank me,

1:12:29.470 --> 1:12:32.389
but that thing...
Could you ask her to put that thing away?

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:35.225
Yu-bin.

1:12:36.435 --> 1:12:38.729
Who are you? Why did you help us?

1:12:39.813 --> 1:12:40.731
Well...

1:12:41.357 --> 1:12:43.942
Aren't you the one who pleaded for help?

1:12:47.905 --> 1:12:49.823
The eighth floor was empty for sure.

1:12:57.581 --> 1:12:58.457
Goodness.

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:00.209
By the way,

1:13:00.876 --> 1:13:02.711
how did you guys manage to survive?

1:13:03.962 --> 1:13:06.673
My gosh, I'm impressed.

1:13:07.424 --> 1:13:11.095
I thought I was the only survivor
in this entire building.

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:13.722
Right, we also thought

1:13:13.931 --> 1:13:17.935
we were the only survivors
and everyone else ended up like that.

1:13:18.352 --> 1:13:19.395
Right, of course.

1:13:20.979 --> 1:13:22.940
But not anymore, right?

1:13:23.023 --> 1:13:25.359
Right, there are three of us now.

1:13:26.610 --> 1:13:28.737
By the way, you seem to know a lot.

1:13:29.488 --> 1:13:31.365
I mean, about them.

1:13:31.949 --> 1:13:33.617
Right, because I'm still alive.

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:36.620
That's all I hear on the news
while stuck at home.

1:13:36.703 --> 1:13:37.913
Right, same here.

1:13:38.497 --> 1:13:41.333
But why were you guys together?
Do you know each other?

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:43.627
No. We didn't know each other before this.

1:13:43.710 --> 1:13:44.962
We met four days ago.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:46.422
I see.

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:49.216
You've been here all by yourself?

1:13:49.299 --> 1:13:50.217
Yes, I guess.

1:13:51.927 --> 1:13:52.761
Anyway...

1:13:55.472 --> 1:13:57.599
Aren't you guys thirsty? Have some water.

1:13:59.768 --> 1:14:00.602
What's wrong?

1:14:01.353 --> 1:14:03.021
Right, I get it.

1:14:04.982 --> 1:14:09.111
With everything that's been going on,
no wonder you're keeping your guard up.

1:14:21.373 --> 1:14:22.583
Just drink it. It's fine.

1:14:27.546 --> 1:14:30.591
Oh, you guys must be hungry.
Do you want some food? Yes?

1:14:34.845 --> 1:14:35.679
I'll have Spam.

1:14:43.687 --> 1:14:45.481
So? Do you guys like it?

1:14:46.064 --> 1:14:47.733
Yes. This is awesome.

1:14:49.610 --> 1:14:50.444
I'm glad.

1:14:53.780 --> 1:14:54.948
Slow down. Eat slowly.

1:14:55.032 --> 1:14:56.658
Okay, thank you.

1:14:57.993 --> 1:15:01.246
There's enough food to last
until the rescue team comes, so slow down.

1:15:02.539 --> 1:15:03.999
-The rescue team?
-Seriously?

1:15:04.082 --> 1:15:05.000
The rescue team?

1:15:06.668 --> 1:15:08.045
You didn't hear the news?

1:15:08.545 --> 1:15:10.422
Isn't that why you guys came up here?

1:15:11.965 --> 1:15:13.634
You really heard that? On the news?

1:15:14.259 --> 1:15:16.345
I can catch the signal from time to time.

1:15:17.471 --> 1:15:19.306
You guys really didn't hear it?

1:15:31.985 --> 1:15:33.737
We're going to make it.

1:15:35.906 --> 1:15:39.493
Yes, we just need to stay here
and hold out for just a little longer.

1:15:41.912 --> 1:15:42.746
My gosh.

1:15:49.461 --> 1:15:52.047
By the way, how did you manage
to hide out all this time?

1:15:55.926 --> 1:15:57.511
Hiding is easy when you're older.

1:15:59.429 --> 1:16:02.432
I hid from my wife when I had to smoke.
I guess that helped.

1:16:16.071 --> 1:16:18.699
Do you have a kid?

1:16:22.578 --> 1:16:23.412
Nope.

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:26.415
But two kids came today.

1:16:28.709 --> 1:16:29.543
Pardon?

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:42.514
Sir.

1:16:52.733 --> 1:16:54.192
Sir...

1:16:55.444 --> 1:16:57.321
Hey, Jun-u.

1:16:58.322 --> 1:16:59.156
Jun-u--

1:17:16.632 --> 1:17:17.883
Just go to sleep.

1:17:20.594 --> 1:17:22.888
Good, just like that.

1:17:25.682 --> 1:17:29.603
Jun-u.

1:19:23.467 --> 1:19:24.426
My wife...

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:27.721
She's starved for days.

1:19:29.765 --> 1:19:30.891
Without you, who knows

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:34.311
how much longer she'd starve?

1:19:38.231 --> 1:19:39.232
I have no choice.

1:19:42.444 --> 1:19:43.570
Jun-u!

1:19:43.987 --> 1:19:45.113
I hope you understand.

1:19:45.197 --> 1:19:47.157
Understand my ass, you nutjob.

1:19:52.788 --> 1:19:53.622
Yu-bin!

1:19:54.206 --> 1:19:56.625
Are you in there? Can you hear me?

1:19:57.083 --> 1:19:58.877
Answer me, Yu-bin!

1:19:59.169 --> 1:20:01.296
Is it so wrong
that I want to save my wife?

1:20:03.089 --> 1:20:05.842
It's not like
you haven't killed anyone yet.

1:20:08.845 --> 1:20:09.721
That's right.

1:20:11.056 --> 1:20:12.641
The fact that we're still alive

1:20:13.517 --> 1:20:16.311
means that both you and I are the same.

1:20:16.394 --> 1:20:17.354
Sir.

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:19.397
Sir, just a moment.

1:20:19.481 --> 1:20:23.235
Hold on. Let's talk, okay?

1:20:23.318 --> 1:20:24.152
All right.

1:20:25.111 --> 1:20:25.946
All right, then.

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.210
Jun-u!

1:20:43.296 --> 1:20:45.090
Jesus, please!

1:20:46.758 --> 1:20:48.134
Can't you just let us live?

1:20:49.261 --> 1:20:50.720
Then what about us?

1:20:51.555 --> 1:20:53.807
Do you think
our lives are fucking worthless?

1:20:54.933 --> 1:20:55.767
Then…

1:20:57.227 --> 1:20:58.520
just leave the girl and go.

1:20:59.771 --> 1:21:01.022
I'll spare your life.

1:21:02.816 --> 1:21:04.526
You can take all the food.

1:21:06.278 --> 1:21:07.112
Just this once.

1:21:09.072 --> 1:21:10.031
Stay back!

1:21:10.115 --> 1:21:13.618
-Just this once!
-One more step and I'll kill you!

1:21:14.119 --> 1:21:18.415
-Just forget about us and leave, please!
-Stay back!

1:21:18.498 --> 1:21:20.250
I'll kill you if you come closer!

1:21:25.255 --> 1:21:26.089
No.

1:21:27.924 --> 1:21:29.885
Yu-bin!

1:21:31.094 --> 1:21:32.971
Yu-bin!

1:21:55.243 --> 1:21:56.077
Honey.

1:22:01.541 --> 1:22:02.375
Honey!

1:22:03.752 --> 1:22:05.420
-Yu-bin!
-Honey!

1:22:13.219 --> 1:22:14.471
It's okay.

1:22:18.099 --> 1:22:20.435
It's okay, honey.

1:22:26.441 --> 1:22:27.817
I know you tried your best.

1:22:36.701 --> 1:22:37.535
It's okay.

1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:46.294
It's...

1:22:48.463 --> 1:22:49.339
over...

1:23:34.759 --> 1:23:35.635
Jun-u.

1:23:51.985 --> 1:23:53.445
We're still human, you know.

1:23:55.238 --> 1:23:56.239
And we're together.

1:24:03.038 --> 1:24:04.080
It's okay now.

1:24:06.166 --> 1:24:07.000
No.

1:24:09.669 --> 1:24:10.503
No.

1:25:05.517 --> 1:25:06.893
Fuck!

1:25:20.198 --> 1:25:22.826
Hold on. Wait. Hold on a second.

1:25:34.087 --> 1:25:35.255
What the fuck?

1:25:35.338 --> 1:25:36.339
Fuck.

1:25:42.387 --> 1:25:43.721
The roof. The rooftop!

1:25:43.805 --> 1:25:45.974
-Wait, this thing...
-The rooftop!

1:25:46.057 --> 1:25:46.975
-Fuck!
-Hurry!

1:25:47.058 --> 1:25:48.601
Where are the scissors?

1:26:21.759 --> 1:26:23.761
Hey, move! Out of the way!

1:26:23.845 --> 1:26:26.514
Move! I said, move!

1:26:48.703 --> 1:26:49.704
Come on! Quick!

1:27:05.261 --> 1:27:06.095
Yu-bin!

1:27:20.944 --> 1:27:21.778
Jun-u.

1:27:22.528 --> 1:27:23.404
Jun-u!

1:27:23.488 --> 1:27:25.031
Go! Just go!

1:27:25.323 --> 1:27:27.367
Run up there and get the chopper!

1:27:29.410 --> 1:27:30.620
You have to hurry, okay?

1:28:05.530 --> 1:28:07.907
No.

1:28:08.866 --> 1:28:09.993
HYDRANT

1:28:20.586 --> 1:28:21.629
Fuck!

1:28:24.716 --> 1:28:27.468
Damn it! Piece of shit apartment!

1:28:37.770 --> 1:28:39.188
Where's the chopper?

1:28:53.745 --> 1:28:55.371
There are survivors here.

1:28:56.205 --> 1:28:57.832
There are survivors here!

1:28:59.751 --> 1:29:01.461
There are survivors here!

1:29:03.963 --> 1:29:06.090
There are survivors here!

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:09.510
There are survivors here!

1:29:10.303 --> 1:29:13.014
We're still alive!

1:29:14.057 --> 1:29:16.434
Over here!

1:29:17.018 --> 1:29:19.354
There are survivors here!

1:29:21.189 --> 1:29:23.983
-We're still...
-There are survivors here!

1:29:24.067 --> 1:29:26.235
We're still alive.

1:31:18.598 --> 1:31:20.892

1:31:23.644 --> 1:31:25.897

MESSAGES

1:31:55.885 --> 1:31:59.931
<i>It's impossible to know</i>
<i>exactly how many people are infected,</i>

1:32:00.014 --> 1:32:02.266
<i>but the authorities speculate</i>
<i>that at least 50,000</i>

1:32:02.350 --> 1:32:03.851
<i>are infected across the country.</i>

1:32:03.935 --> 1:32:07.438
<i>The metropolitan area</i>
<i>is hit especially hard</i>

1:32:07.522 --> 1:32:10.650
<i>because of the little space</i>
<i>between apartment units.</i>

1:32:10.733 --> 1:32:13.569
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>the rescue squad is rescuing survivors</i>

1:32:13.653 --> 1:32:16.405
<i>from the areas</i>
<i>with many apartment complexes</i>

1:32:16.489 --> 1:32:19.742
<i>by tracing SOS messages</i>
<i>posted on social media sites by civilians.</i>

1:32:19.951 --> 1:32:24.205
<i>Thankfully, each region's internet</i>
<i>and wireless networks are being restored,</i>

1:32:24.288 --> 1:32:27.333
<i>so the SOS messages on social media</i>
<i>have been rather effective.</i>

1:32:27.416 --> 1:32:31.170
<i>Each region's Disaster and Safety</i>
<i>Countermeasures Headquarters</i>

1:32:31.254 --> 1:32:34.632
<i>will be pushing a campaign</i>
<i>that encourages all survivors</i>

1:32:34.715 --> 1:32:37.093
<i>to post their current locations</i>
