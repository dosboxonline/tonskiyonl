WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:05.880
Can I get a what's up?

00:05.964 --> 00:06.965
Can you get a what?

00:07.048 --> 00:08.591
No time for pleasantries, Steve.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.385
I've unsleeved the pudding pop.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.220
That's right.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.931
A lot of stuff has been going on
around here without my comment,

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
and I think it's time to...

00:16.516 --> 00:18.643
...tell it like it is.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.895
That's right. I tell it like it is.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.605
I call it like I see it.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.065
Do I pussyfoot around?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.150
I can't.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.278
It begins now.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.780
Hayley, you know what I'm going to say.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.240
The bicycle shorts.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.992
The bicycle shorts you wore last week.

00:34.075 --> 00:37.245
I didn't see a bicycle.
Was it a fashion thing?

00:37.328 --> 00:38.830
With a baggy sweater, I thought--

00:38.913 --> 00:39.914
It looked bad.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.083
Francine, I saw
on the credit card statement

00:42.167 --> 00:44.127
you got a subscription to Master Class?

00:44.210 --> 00:46.129
Doris Kearns Goodwin does one--

00:46.212 --> 00:49.090
You're going to become
a DKG-level historian?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.884
That'd be the first time
anyone in this family

00:50.967 --> 00:52.135
followed through on something.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.429
Remember how you all saw
the movie Nightcrawler

00:54.512 --> 00:56.347
and you all wanted to become
Nightcrawlers,

00:56.431 --> 00:58.850
selling pictures
of car accidents to the news?

00:58.933 --> 01:00.643
How many of you are Nightcrawlers now?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.604
We, we could...
We could be Nightcrawlers.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.272
Big mistake piping up, Steve.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.441
The other day, your hair
came down into your face?

01:06.524 --> 01:07.525
No.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.360
I was getting out of the pool!

01:09.444 --> 01:11.821
You don't have a face where
you can ever let your hair

01:11.905 --> 01:13.948
come forward like that.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.701
It's your nose.
Just telling it like it is.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.495
Talk to me about hair.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.330
Of all people. Good gracious.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.500
What's that, son?
Is it a hard truth you're muttering?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.835
Hit me with it. I can take it.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.215
I said it's funny for you of all people
to criticize someone's hair!

01:30.298 --> 01:31.299
You're bald!

01:31.382 --> 01:34.094
- Bald...bald...
- Previously on American Dad...

01:34.177 --> 01:35.303
Dad?

01:35.386 --> 01:36.471
Ooh!

01:36.554 --> 01:38.348
Bald! Bald! Bald!

01:38.431 --> 01:40.100
Bald! Bald!

01:40.183 --> 01:41.518
Pretty good Steve impression, huh?

01:41.601 --> 01:42.727
Now do Klaus!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.604
What's up, dudes?

01:44.687 --> 01:47.148
Klaus usually says "bros."

01:49.776 --> 01:52.946
Good morning, USA

01:53.029 --> 01:56.407
I got a feelin'
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:56.491 --> 01:59.494
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:59.577 --> 02:03.665
And he's shinin' a salute
To the American race

02:05.750 --> 02:09.045
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:09.129 --> 02:11.214
-Good--
-Good morning, USA

02:11.297 --> 02:12.423
Aah!

02:14.217 --> 02:17.178
Good morning, USA

02:19.931 --> 02:22.183
There I was, blasting them with the truth,

02:22.267 --> 02:24.310
one of my best tell-it-like-it-is-es-es,

02:24.394 --> 02:27.313
and Steve just knocks the wind
out of me with, with...

02:27.397 --> 02:28.648
The truth?

02:28.731 --> 02:29.732
Yes.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.068
Ya know, Stan, to tell it
like it is freely,

02:32.152 --> 02:34.445
you must remove all your weaknesses.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.698
Baldness is my only weakness.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.992
You know, there's
a hair transplant technique

02:39.075 --> 02:41.286
I read about that's very cutting edge,

02:41.369 --> 02:42.620
hair seeds.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.706
"Cutting edge" is intriguing.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.000
If you did it, I could arrange
to have your new hair

02:47.083 --> 02:48.751
styled by none other than,

02:48.835 --> 02:50.420
get ready for this,

02:50.503 --> 02:52.547
Josay Bosay.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.467
-Who?
-Are you serious?

02:56.551 --> 02:57.802
Josay Bosay?

02:57.886 --> 03:00.638
He's my most celebrated
hair stylist character.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.764
I have never heard of him.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.225
Back in the '70s, Josay gave Rod Stewart

03:04.309 --> 03:06.561
what would turn out to be
his forever haircut.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.773
You know what, Roger?
I will get hair seeds!

03:10.857 --> 03:13.526
I'm so excited, I have to journal!

03:13.610 --> 03:15.778
Is Stan right about us?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.406
We were so excited
about being Nightcrawlers.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.326
It's all we talked about in 2015.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.704
But how many times did we
actually go out on the prowl?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.080
Not even once.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.583
Look, did you all like
the movie Nightcrawler?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.335
-Yes!
-More than anything.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
And do you still think about it every day?

03:32.462 --> 03:33.963
-Yes!
-Morning to night!

03:34.047 --> 03:36.216
And do you think that taking
pictures of car accidents

03:36.299 --> 03:38.593
and crime scenes
seems like easy, fun money?

03:38.676 --> 03:39.719
Yes!

03:39.802 --> 03:40.803
Then get out there!

03:44.015 --> 03:46.059
No one ever uses the fireman pole.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.978
Not even me.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.277
With my proprietary hair seed technology,

03:56.361 --> 03:59.155
giving you a big, beautiful mane of hair

03:59.239 --> 04:01.074
is as easy as one, two, three.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.535
Now, let's take the wig off
and see what we're working with.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.538
I can't do it.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.707
My...head's under there.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.917
I'm right here.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.085
I'm too nervous!

04:12.168 --> 04:13.753
What if I hold the other hand?

04:15.380 --> 04:16.631
And now...

04:17.924 --> 04:20.134
I'm a monster.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.928
It's okay, Mr. Smith.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.473
As a professional, I see
this sort of thing every day.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.392
Pamela, bring me some Dramamine.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.310
I'm looking at something
that makes me queasier

04:29.394 --> 04:31.020
than any roller coaster.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.481
These hair seeds are gonna go nuclear

04:33.564 --> 04:36.651
when they touch down
on that cueball melon of yours.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.695
Let's gas this Kojak.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.489
I thought this was
an outpatient surgery.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.699
Shh.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.409
It's gonna be a breeze.

04:45.743 --> 04:49.080
Stan, things are going very badly.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.416
Your body has rejected the hair seeds,

04:51.499 --> 04:52.917
and something went nuts with your kidneys.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.669
They swelled up and got very big,

04:54.752 --> 04:56.754
then they shrunk down very small,

04:56.838 --> 04:58.298
then they made a hissing sound,

04:58.381 --> 05:00.049
then they just flat-out vanished.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.635
I saw the whole thing on ultrasound.
I was like...

05:04.387 --> 05:05.805
What does this mean for my hair?

05:05.888 --> 05:07.515
We need a rare double donor,

05:07.598 --> 05:10.059
both a kidney and a hair match.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.770
Fortunately, I already
found the right person.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.772
They're here, they're excited to help,

05:14.856 --> 05:16.649
and they're right behind this curtain.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.026
Looks like Tuttle.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
I'm going to insist
the donation be anonymous.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.612
This is an outrage!

05:21.696 --> 05:22.864
I'm a hero!

05:22.947 --> 05:25.533
Stay behind the screen. It is my wish.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.076
Prep for surgery!

05:27.160 --> 05:30.663
Let's get hairy!

05:30.747 --> 05:32.582
-Aah!
-He's dead again?

05:32.665 --> 05:34.459
This is a nightmare!

05:34.542 --> 05:36.502
My anesthesia's not working!

05:36.586 --> 05:38.338
My anesthesia's not working!

05:38.421 --> 05:39.922
Shut up! Shut up!

05:41.215 --> 05:43.092
Stan, open your eyes.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.347
It worked.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.765
- Hair?
- Oh, yeah.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.975
And it was easy as one, two, three

05:51.059 --> 05:52.060
months in a coma.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.144
I was in a coma?

05:53.227 --> 05:55.104
It's time to remove this towel

05:55.188 --> 05:57.357
and send you out into the world,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.025
a man who has hair,

05:59.108 --> 06:00.234
but no towel.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.779
The fruit...

06:02.862 --> 06:04.322
of the hair seed.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.116
Oh!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.659
Ohh!

06:08.743 --> 06:10.578
Ooh.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.289
I look like the Beast
from Beauty and the Beast!

06:13.373 --> 06:16.125
Now I get to bring you to Josay Bosay

06:16.209 --> 06:17.960
for your first-ever haircut.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.962
I can't keep my hands out of it!

06:20.046 --> 06:22.298
I love seeing you so happy, Stan.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.925
Anonymous! Anonymous!

06:30.681 --> 06:33.184
Uh, Stan Smith, here for Josay Bosay?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.025
Naughty boy!

06:41.109 --> 06:43.945
Trying to read my unfinished memoirs!

06:44.904 --> 06:47.740
There's some juicy stuff in that memoir.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.368
When Morgan Fairchild reads
what I have to say

06:50.451 --> 06:53.704
about our hot affair,
she's going to be so very angry.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.873
But she gets horny when she's angry,

06:55.957 --> 06:58.876
so more sex for me, right, gorgeous?

07:00.503 --> 07:02.547
These are scribbles. Not writing.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.841
Oh, I can write. And I can read, too.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.759
I read a book that was one majillion,

07:06.843 --> 07:07.927
but let's talk hair.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.429
I want this haircut to be good.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.889
Rod was nervous, too,

07:11.973 --> 07:13.474
before I gave him that.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.893
Make me look like me.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.812
The most me.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.665
Et voilà!

07:37.748 --> 07:40.084
You just became...

07:40.168 --> 07:41.419
a butterfly.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.879
-I hate it.
-How's that, gorgeous?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.046
It's a horrible haircut.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.923
It's Rod Stewart's forever cut!

07:46.007 --> 07:47.467
It's an out-of-date hair-do.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.926
It's a hair-don't, frankly.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.388
I gotta tell it like it is.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.976
Josay Bosay, you're obviously
nothing but a washed-up dinosaur.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.020
He looks horrible.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.730
You look horrible.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.607
We all look horrible!

08:02.690 --> 08:05.067
This fool only knows one haircut!

08:05.151 --> 08:08.154
It's official, Josay Bosay is finished!

08:08.237 --> 08:09.780
To the hat store!

08:10.948 --> 08:13.618
Stan, what have you done?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.785
I'm ruined!

08:14.869 --> 08:16.996
Josay Bosay is ruined!

08:19.624 --> 08:22.502
Hello, Josay Bosay salon,
we're ruined.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.716
I need it fixed.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.595
Can the hair artists at Fantastic Sam's
guarantee total perfection?

08:34.388 --> 08:36.015
I'm sorry, is someone crying on your end

08:36.098 --> 08:38.017
or is that coming from my house?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.269
Several people are crying there, you say?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.067
Pube shapes are hot!

08:46.150 --> 08:48.694
Josay is no-o-o-ot!

08:49.820 --> 08:51.822
Terrible about Josay, isn't it?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.449
How you destroyed him?

08:53.533 --> 08:57.662
And after he stood by you
during your difficult hairplug recovery.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.080
Klaus, don't interact with me.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.748
I, uh... I... I don't know.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.250
I... I feel weird right now.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.502
You feel guilt, Stan.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.920
No, I think it's just that earlier,

09:06.003 --> 09:09.215
I ate an entire hardshell crab
like it was a softshell crab.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.883
Besides, why would I be guilty?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.426
I was only telling it like it is.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.388
Stan, perhaps I can tell you like it is.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.890
Telling it like it is is mean!

09:17.974 --> 09:20.184
And when you're mean, you feel guilty.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
And sometimes...

09:21.727 --> 09:24.605
it feels like you ate
the wrong kind of crab.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.233
Wow. When you put it like that...

09:27.316 --> 09:28.693
Well, so, what am I supposed to do?

09:28.776 --> 09:32.071
Support your friend by lying to his face.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.364
Reverse all your positions.

09:33.447 --> 09:36.284
Say anything that will make him feel good.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.953
Klaus, you're a genius and I love you.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.037
You do?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.872
Whoa, lying's easy.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.374
I'm gonna go do it to Roger.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.169
-Roger?
-It's Josay!

09:47.253 --> 09:50.464
Look, Josay, I've been meaning
to say how sorry I am

09:50.548 --> 09:51.924
for what happened at your salon.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.051
Former salon. You hated the cut.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.887
Wrong! I love this haircut!

09:56.971 --> 09:59.056
Really?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.975
But the awful things you said...

10:01.058 --> 10:02.476
A misunderstanding.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.145
You called me out-of-date.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.646
Shyeah. Timeless!

10:05.730 --> 10:06.939
What about washed up?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.233
Washed up. Clean, tidy!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.944
Okay, I see that. And dinosaur?

10:12.028 --> 10:14.405
Like a T-rex. He's the king, bud.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.201
Talk about your misunderstandings!

10:19.285 --> 10:21.245
Now, I'm ecstatic you like the cut,

10:21.329 --> 10:24.332
but if you want to maintain
that electrocuted bird look,

10:24.415 --> 10:26.751
you'll need to apply this constantly.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.294
It's got a strong smell.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.046
What...is this?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.173
A little home recipe I cooked up.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.841
It's starting to sting.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.259
It's very astringent.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.761
That's why I wear the gloves.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.013
It's hair-friendly, not skin-friendly.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.806
Well, I... I love it.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
You know what? I could sell this.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.353
It could be the key to my comeback.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.479
I think a little's getting in my--

10:46.562 --> 10:48.064
Ow!

10:48.147 --> 10:50.858
I mean... I mean wow! This is great stuff.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.819
I just have to get people
to love it as much as you do!

10:53.903 --> 10:56.113
If that's even possible!

10:58.699 --> 11:00.910
Am I a lucky duck or what?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.828
I put out feelers that I'm interested in

11:02.912 --> 11:05.956
starting my own product line,
wanna spend lots of money,

11:06.040 --> 11:09.210
and I'm immediately contacted
by Roz and Larry here

11:09.293 --> 11:11.379
to be my manufacturing partners!

11:11.462 --> 11:13.798
They're complete strangers,
but they have a nice house,

11:13.881 --> 11:16.008
and that makes me trust them
on a gut level.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.637
Why is the factory closed, again?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.764
Oh, a skunk got in there.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.182
Pissed or whatever.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.725
Well, I'm convinced.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.604
Stan, is this a great idea
or is this a great idea?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.065
Or do you not like it
and think I'm a fool?

11:31.148 --> 11:32.733
Uh, it's... It's great.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.527
-You're great.
-Oh, excellent.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.446
Roz, Larry, here is a check
for the last of my money.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.658
Oh, great, but we can do this later.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.910
Uhp!

11:42.993 --> 11:44.912
That's a good sign, right?

11:44.995 --> 11:47.081
-Eager to get started?
-Uh...

11:47.164 --> 11:49.542
Stan, they have a very expensive home.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.960
They don't need my money.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.795
I think this is an open house.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.797
Could you both sign in?

11:55.297 --> 11:57.007
So, I've been getting quite the runaround,

11:57.091 --> 11:59.510
but you're the right person
to help me stop a check?

11:59.593 --> 12:02.555
Well, I wrote a check
that was my entire life savings

12:02.638 --> 12:05.057
made out to cash earlier today,
and I'd like to...

12:05.141 --> 12:07.017
Stop! That! Check!

12:07.768 --> 12:10.271
Okay, thank you so much! You're gorgeous!

12:10.354 --> 12:12.022
They cashed it hours ago.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.026
I'm a fool! A failure!

12:16.110 --> 12:17.945
I know you know it, Stan!

12:18.028 --> 12:19.405
Tell me like it is!

12:20.406 --> 12:22.575
Well, if you must know the truth...

12:22.658 --> 12:23.951
No! Keep lying, Stan!

12:24.034 --> 12:25.536
Wuzzat?

12:25.619 --> 12:26.954
The truth is...

12:27.037 --> 12:28.122
Lie, lie, lie!

12:28.205 --> 12:29.874
Wuzzat?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.751
You're a great hairdresser.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.210
Yes!

12:33.294 --> 12:35.504
Do you really think so?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.048
You're the greatest hairdresser
in the world.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.218
Do you mean the greatest now,

12:41.302 --> 12:42.970
or of all time?

12:43.053 --> 12:45.306
Um...all time.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.974
Including the future, too?

12:47.057 --> 12:48.392
How could I possibly know--

12:48.476 --> 12:49.977
Yes.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.437
Including the future, too.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.191
"The greatest hairdresser of all time."
I have to agree.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.776
You know, I think we're in this mess

12:56.859 --> 13:00.404
because I forgot it's about the hair,
not this facocta product.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.200
So, if I want to get back on top...

13:05.075 --> 13:08.996
I need to give Rod Stewart
a new forever haircut!

13:09.079 --> 13:10.456
That's what worked before!

13:10.539 --> 13:13.250
Oh, Rod's gonna be so excited!

13:13.334 --> 13:15.294
But I don't know how
to get in touch with him.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.378
Hmm...

13:16.462 --> 13:18.589
Aw, and it was such a good idea.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.008
Oh, man! Lucky duck alert!

13:21.091 --> 13:22.593
It's a picture of Rod.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.804
I can read the squiggles,

13:24.887 --> 13:26.597
but why don't you read them to me?

13:27.765 --> 13:30.184
It says Rod's in town
for the grand opening

13:30.267 --> 13:32.394
of one of his incredible stew restaurants,

13:32.478 --> 13:33.771
the Art of Stew

13:33.854 --> 13:35.731
by Rod Stew-Art.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.193
Rod Stewart is the same person
as Rod Stew-Art?!

13:39.276 --> 13:40.402
Yum, right?

13:40.486 --> 13:44.198
I can taste those big, hard
carrot pieces already.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.045
Restaurant opening is
in 15 minutes, Mr. Stewart.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.421
Eh, it's okay.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.507
They can't make the stew without me.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.679
Surprise, Rod-baby!

14:06.762 --> 14:09.014
I'm sure sorry we snuck
into your limo, sir.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.391
I love your stews.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.351
Josay Bosay!

14:12.434 --> 14:15.104
Give us a kiss, you cheeky bastard!

14:15.187 --> 14:16.355
Mwah!

14:16.438 --> 14:18.774
Josay, why has it been so long?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.484
Oh, I thought it was because we were both

14:20.568 --> 14:22.903
after the smashing Victoria Principal,

14:22.987 --> 14:25.823
legs for days, lot of cowlicks,
though, for a woman,

14:25.906 --> 14:29.201
and when she chose me,
I figured it ate you up inside.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.580
Josay, I thought you were a homosexual?

14:32.663 --> 14:33.664
Oh, yeah.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.499
Anyway, Rod, there's not much time.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.085
I'm very impressed
by all the success you've had

14:38.168 --> 14:39.628
with the stew restaurants.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.796
Mwah.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.590
What a great new chapter for you.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.175
Speaking of new chapters, I want one.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.261
And what better way for me to have one

14:47.344 --> 14:49.680
than by giving you a brand-new hairstyle

14:49.763 --> 14:51.891
to be revealed at the grand opening

14:51.974 --> 14:54.268
of one of your suburban stew restaurants?

14:54.351 --> 14:56.729
Seems like a strange plan.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.231
It's not. It's a very good plan.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.191
Just ask Stan. He's on board.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.819
The bloke with the great hair?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.070
That's Stan.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.156
My most supportive friend.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.574
Now, let's get cracking.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.619
Absolutely not, Bosay!

15:15.956 --> 15:18.208
Stan, he's not letting me do it!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.045
Stan, help!

15:31.972 --> 15:33.807
Did we just kidnap Rod Stewart?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.267
Yes, you did!

15:35.351 --> 15:36.727
Okay, that's one vote.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.108
Greg, here's what we know.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.778
We know Rod Stewart's limousine
was hijacked

15:45.861 --> 15:48.530
at the opening of his new stew restaurant.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.660
We know his stews are really
flavorful, very rich.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.036
We know Rod Stewart is...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.704
I want to say Australian?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.707
As you can see, the police
have them well-surrounded.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.250
I imagine whoever is in there

16:00.334 --> 16:03.253
cannot feel too good
about their prospects.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.588
I'm feeling good about this.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.091
Let's cut your hair
and become fabulous together.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.175
Again.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.427
Josay, please stop the limo.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.221
I'm scared for all our lives.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.722
Roger, what's happening back there?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.100
The headline is "I'm feeling good."

16:16.183 --> 16:17.184
Rod's warming up.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.603
His eyes aren't doing
as much fearful darting.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.188
Few more laps around the ol' highway

16:21.271 --> 16:22.356
and I think he'll let me cut him.

16:22.439 --> 16:23.857
Oh, dear.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.614
And here they come to get their pictures,

16:30.698 --> 16:32.408
those disgusting, scum-sucking...

16:32.491 --> 16:34.952
Nightcrawlers!

16:35.035 --> 16:37.579
If the kidnappers are a bunch
of babes with big ones,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.832
we could be looking at 50 Gs.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.584
-Yeah.
-We gotta get closer.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.044
If Rod Stewart is killed

16:44.128 --> 16:45.713
and we're not there to get the picture,

16:45.796 --> 16:48.882
well, then, are we even
loathsome Nightcrawlers at all?

16:51.927 --> 16:53.554
Could be a shootout.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.306
Might crash. Might fireball. Yeah.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.142
Might fireball, boom. Boom!

16:58.225 --> 17:00.769
Look! We can get from
the off-ramp to the on-ramp,

17:00.853 --> 17:03.355
blow right past the police line.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.649
Fireball!

17:05.733 --> 17:07.860
Punch it, punch it, punch it, yeah, yeah!

17:07.943 --> 17:09.403
Now...

17:09.486 --> 17:10.738
punch it!

17:10.821 --> 17:12.906
-No!
-You said punch it!

17:12.990 --> 17:14.825
The last one I switched it to mean brake!

17:14.908 --> 17:16.452
Punch the brake!

17:18.454 --> 17:21.707
Those goddamn Nightcrawlers!

17:21.790 --> 17:24.084
Nightcrawlers,
desperate for magic footage

17:24.168 --> 17:26.712
of a celebrity death,
have caused an accident.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.590
Their pursuit of senselessly
gratuitous coverage

17:29.673 --> 17:32.885
sickens me to the very core
of my journalistic integrity.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.262
-Should we cut the feed?
-Don't be a nitwit.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.972
What if there's a fireball?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.478
Rod, please!

17:42.561 --> 17:43.854
No!

17:45.147 --> 17:47.107
Bla-dow!

17:53.655 --> 17:55.741
It's time to give up!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.578
Oh, good, you're coming back.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.997
I forgot to tell you,
Roz and Larry reached out.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.833
It was a misunderstanding,
but to get me my money back,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.835
they needed my social security number.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.920
Great news, right?

18:08.003 --> 18:09.963
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

18:10.047 --> 18:11.757
I felt guilty and I overcorrected,

18:11.840 --> 18:14.593
but all this lying to be nice
has made everything terrible!

18:14.676 --> 18:16.929
Terrible? In what way?

18:17.012 --> 18:20.099
I have no choice now
but to tell you like it is.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.936
Only this time, I'm going
to try to add in...

18:24.019 --> 18:25.104
some kindness.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.647
Okay.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.482
I'm scared, but I'm ready.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.110
You're an ass.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.238
Your mind is an explosive
source of shitty ideas,

18:34.321 --> 18:35.531
and all to do what?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.866
Revive a career that didn't
matter to begin with?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.785
You're a terrible stylist.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.745
Aside from a total lack of taste,

18:41.829 --> 18:43.872
you're also just not a good haircutter,

18:43.956 --> 18:45.082
on a craftsman level.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.876
Scissor skills are zero.
Everyone knows you're illiterate,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.462
so it's excruciating when you
keep showing people your book,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.965
or pretend to sit down
with that big quill pen.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.050
-Your breath--
-The kindness, please?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.885
When is it? When is it?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.429
You...

18:59.513 --> 19:03.225
make me feel bad when I say
how awful you are at everything.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.395
Because you're nice to me.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.981
You make me wish I thought
you were a better man.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.941
Wow.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.192
Yeah.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.277
But you're not.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.988
Sweet Maggie May,

19:16.071 --> 19:19.575
both of you are trying
so hard to change, to grow.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.244
And maybe I've been stuck in a rut myself.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.705
Josay...let's do it.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.833
This has been a long time
coming, Roddy-boy.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.335
Eh, the haircut. Let's do the haircut.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.004
I'm horny for that, too.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.173
Seems like someone should sing...

19:34.256 --> 19:35.924
I hadn't prepared...

19:36.008 --> 19:37.092
It's me!

19:38.510 --> 19:42.431
With that hair,
you look a fool

19:42.514 --> 19:46.101
But with this cut,
you could be cool

19:46.185 --> 19:50.564
-You'll appear young
-You'll appear young

19:50.647 --> 19:54.693
-Basically young
-Basically young

19:54.776 --> 19:57.070
More or less young

19:57.154 --> 19:59.406
In the right light

19:59.489 --> 20:02.993
If they don't get too close

20:03.076 --> 20:06.705
You'll appear young...

20:20.552 --> 20:22.221
They kidnapped Rod!

20:22.304 --> 20:23.305
Murder them!

20:31.063 --> 20:34.066
It's... It's not Rod Stewart.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.486
It's some old skeleton with
a different out-of-date haircut.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.154
It's the Clooney!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.073
Rod Stewart isn't here!

20:41.156 --> 20:42.950
And maybe he never even existed!

20:43.033 --> 20:44.159
Let's go home!

20:48.455 --> 20:51.083
Rod, you may have noticed
some similarities

20:51.166 --> 20:52.960
between the song I sang in the limo

20:53.043 --> 20:54.711
and your song "Forever Young."

20:54.795 --> 20:56.797
- Yeah, kind of.
- Great.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.840
Then you'll understand why I'm suing you.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.221
Have a great night!
