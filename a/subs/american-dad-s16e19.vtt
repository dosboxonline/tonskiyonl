famous for asking on Fridays --

00:06.840 --> 00:08.591
What's everyone
doing this weekend?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.011
Me and Dick are gonna go
check out this cranberry bog

Hey, would you mind
asking the other guys?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.408

00:33.491 --> 00:35.410
I'll get trapped
in a conversation with you.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.078
But you're the only one
with a family,

00:37.162 --> 00:39.164
and families have always
fascinated me

00:39.247 --> 00:41.666
because I don't have one.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.335
That's a stupid reason
to be fascinated by something.

I don't have a vagina
and I never think about those.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.466

about them a little bit.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.202
Yeah, no shit.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.370
Dr. Weitzman --

10:21.454 --> 10:22.872
-Call me Dad.
-No.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.457
-Uncle?
-That's worse.

10:24.540 --> 10:27.376
Dr. Weitzman,
why are you doing this?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.170
Great question, Franny.

10:29.253 --> 10:32.214
Chardonnay, roll tape
and do it like...

10:32.298 --> 10:33.299
Christoph Waltz.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.552
Christoph Waltz mode initiated.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.518
No one knows when
or where Dr. Weitzman was born.

10:44.602 --> 10:48.105
He was abandoned as a baby
in the Lanceton sewers,

10:48.189 --> 10:52.693
where even the rats refused
to be his family.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.321
Dr. Weitzman's adolescence

10:55.404 --> 10:58.824
was spent
in and out of orphanages.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.828
He briefly appeared on
The Mickey Mouse Club

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
until he caught the attention

11:04.747 --> 11:07.083
of the show's
legendary producer

11:07.166 --> 11:09.168
and was quickly removed.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.630
Then back to his sewers
for doctor school.

11:12.713 --> 11:17.551
But even after becoming
a successful C.I.A. doctor,

11:17.635 --> 11:20.096
he could never find
the right woman.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.349
So he was never able to start
the family

11:23.432 --> 11:25.351
he dreamt of his whole life.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.603
And adoption was out
of the question

11:27.687 --> 11:30.648
because obviously
his appearance

11:30.731 --> 11:32.566
terrifies children --

11:32.650 --> 11:34.819
Chardonnay, did I sign off
on this artwork?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.156
We're screwed.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.950
You know how stubborn Dad is.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.619
He'll never admit you can have
a bad time at the buffet.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.704
You're right.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.331
If we're getting out of here,
it's up to us.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.752
I did it.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.672
I ate all that disgusting soup.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.173

I've been trying to smile

Everybody sneak a Monte Cristo
sandwich into bed tonight.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.892
This plan sounds delicious, Dad.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.936
Don't be cute, Steve.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.147
Dad!

13:35.231 --> 13:36.899
We all brought sandwiches
to bed.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.983
What's the plan?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.777
Five minutes, son.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.945
Stan!

13:41.028 --> 13:43.239
Chumbawumba!
Okay.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.865
Everything we need
for our escape

13:44.949 --> 13:47.409
is right here
in the Monte Cristo sandwich.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.912
I'll remove it from the baggie
and just lightly touch

13:49.995 --> 13:52.331
the grease-soaked bread
to the sheets.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.252
Wow. And gross.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.882
Next we use the jam.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.264
Wow, that's strong jam.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.141
I think I just figured out
why I almost died of diarrhea.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.312
Wait.
It's powdered sugar time.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.236
We're not going this way,
but it looks cool, right?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.156
Wait, we should grab Klaus!

14:26.240 --> 14:27.324
There's no time!

14:27.408 --> 14:31.328
Next, everyone take the ham
out of your sandwich and eat it.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.289
It's the perfect
protein-rich snack

14:33.372 --> 14:35.624
to keep our motors humming.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.209
Is anyone there?!

14:37.293 --> 14:39.962
It sounds like
four people eating ham!

14:40.045 --> 14:41.672
Good ham.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.220
Oh, man, the forbidden door
is locked!

14:48.304 --> 14:52.433
Luckily, the "Giving Sandwich"
has one last thing to give.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.601
The bread.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.858
This isn't an exit.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.568
It's a graveyard.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.653
Look at the way they're grouped.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.532
I think they're...
other families.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
Yes, there are a lot
of dead bodies,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.537
but at least it's not
a gift shop.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.456
I hate crass commercialism.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.458
But the skeletons are for sale.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.709
I make keychains!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.794
Perfect
for a gas station bathroom!

15:20.878 --> 15:22.796
Do you have
any gas station owner friends

15:22.880 --> 15:24.882
who have a birthday coming up?

15:30.387 --> 15:34.099
You killed all those families?

15:34.183 --> 15:37.144
What?
No, they killed themselves.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.896
On average,
most offed themselves

15:38.979 --> 15:41.190
after living with Dr. Weitzman
for three days.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.108
Though the current record
is the Shelmerdines,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.152
who only lasted 45 minutes.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.695
That hurt my feelings.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.990
But you guys really hurt
my feelings trying to escape.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.825
I thought you loved me.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.702
Wait, the other families
killed themselves

15:53.786 --> 15:55.162
without trying to escape?

15:55.245 --> 15:58.082
Well, it was before
my online guitar lessons.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.709
Before I got really good.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.919
You suck at guitar.

was a smell, though.
