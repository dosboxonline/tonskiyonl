14:16.250 --> 14:21.667
Yes, until he liberated me
and gave me purpose.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.125
[shield warbling]

14:28.375 --> 14:30.583
You were right about me
not trusting anybody.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.667
But you were wrong about one thing.

14:38.042 --> 14:39.125
[low whisper] You can die.

14:39.958 --> 14:42.000
[pained grunting]

14:42.000 --> 14:43.542
[electricity crackling]

14:49.833 --> 14:50.875
[sharp exhale]

15:00.292 --> 15:05.417
Agent Shepherd just did what no ICN
analyst has been able to do in 28 years.

15:05.417 --> 15:09.792
She got the location of
the most wanted AI terrorist in history.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.750
Okay, you have your marching orders.
Get to it.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.667
Yes, sir.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.792
Atlas, you all right?

15:19.792 --> 15:21.125
Quad Americano.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.917
[coffee machine]
<i>Quad Americano. Excellent choice.</i>

15:22.917 --> 15:24.000
[exhales heavily]

15:24.958 --> 15:26.417
- [machine hisses, spits]
- [bell dings]

15:26.417 --> 15:27.500
<i>Enjoy your coffee!</i>

15:27.500 --> 15:28.625
Are you kidding me?

15:28.625 --> 15:29.875
God!

15:29.875 --> 15:31.792
You've been going after Harlan
for so long,

15:31.792 --> 15:33.542
you don't know
what else to do with your life.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.792
Which is why I have to be
the one to bring him down.

15:35.792 --> 15:37.375
Look, I know
where you're going with this--

15:37.375 --> 15:39.500
Where I'm going is on that mission!

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I need to know that he is dead.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.542
Yeah.

15:51.292 --> 15:52.125
What?

15:53.208 --> 15:55.833
Mission specs changed. We're, uh...

15:55.833 --> 15:57.417
We're taking Harlan alive.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.667
SAPTECH wants Harlan's CPU.
They want to backtrace his code

16:01.667 --> 16:03.792
so they can figure out
how he broke his programming.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.625
I'm sending in Colonel Banks
and the Fourth Rangers Battalion.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.958
- Colonel who?
- Banks. Elias Banks.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.000
You can call me Elias. General.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.792
- Good to see you.
- You as well, sir.

16:13.792 --> 16:17.917
Agent Shepherd, um,
pleasure to make your acquaintance.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.375
Your interrogation of Casca
was impressive.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.083
Okay, so...
[humorless chuckle]

16:24.083 --> 16:26.000
...just to be clear,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.208
you're going to conduct a ground operation

16:28.208 --> 16:30.083
of an unsurveyed alien planet

16:30.750 --> 16:34.333
against an intelligence who is designed
to outmaneuver and outthink us.

16:35.083 --> 16:35.917
That's the plan?

16:38.333 --> 16:40.042
Well, that's a bit reductive. But--

16:40.042 --> 16:44.083
Harlan is a household bot who uploaded
new code to every AI he could,

16:44.083 --> 16:45.708
to commit full-on genocide!

16:46.708 --> 16:48.375
Clearly Agent Shepherd
has some trepidation.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.542
Yeah.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.458
I need a coffee.

16:53.458 --> 16:57.750
I got a mission to prep.
You have a nice day, Agent Shepherd.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.750
I am the only reason you know where he is!

17:01.667 --> 17:03.958
Should I send you a thank you note
when we get back?

17:04.542 --> 17:08.542
If you try to take him alive,
you won't be coming back.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.083
None of you will.

17:13.833 --> 17:17.458
Agent Shepherd, can I show you something?

17:24.500 --> 17:27.042
[heavy, rhythmic thudding]

17:33.167 --> 17:34.625
[Elias] You, um, wanted a coffee?

17:34.625 --> 17:37.250
[feminine voice]
<i>Here you are, Agent Shepherd.</i>

17:37.833 --> 17:39.542
<i>I hope you enjoy it.</i>

17:42.125 --> 17:44.333
I mean, I wanted a good cup of coffee.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.750
- [feminine voice] <i>Oh.</i>
- And I've seen an ARC suit before.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.625
<i>I'm not a suit. My name is Zoe.</i>

17:49.625 --> 17:52.583
<i>- Hey, come back here! Give me that mug!</i>
- Zoe, you can leave the mug. It's fine.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.625
<i>- Oh, okay then.</i>
- Wait. How did it know I wanted coffee?

17:55.625 --> 17:59.542
<i>I'm sorry, but my pronouns
are she and her, not "it."</i>

17:59.542 --> 18:03.083
She was aware of our conversation
because we're synched.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.167
[device buzzes rhythmically]

18:07.167 --> 18:09.583
Neural Links? You can't be serious!

18:10.333 --> 18:12.083
There's a reason those were outlawed!

18:12.083 --> 18:13.958
Your mother was a genius.

18:13.958 --> 18:17.333
The Neural Link she invented
was the gateway to the future of AI.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.042
Now hers was a one-way transfer,
human brain to AI.

18:20.042 --> 18:22.083
But this is no doubt where she was headed.

18:22.083 --> 18:27.500
A safe two-way connection that increases
the neural pathways in my brain and Zoe's.

18:27.500 --> 18:32.167
It's a perfect symbiosis,
not human or AI, but something new.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.125
Something powerful.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.458
I know what happened
between you and Harlan,

18:36.458 --> 18:39.583
but any synced ranger
will be superior to Harlan,

18:39.583 --> 18:42.000
and I have an entire squadron.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.083
[clanking footfalls]

18:48.708 --> 18:50.667
[soldier] Let's go! Load it in! Let's go!

18:50.667 --> 18:56.167
[announcer] <i>Attention all personnel:
Dhiib load-in now complete.</i>

18:56.167 --> 18:58.667
If you really want
to try to capture Harlan,

18:59.958 --> 19:02.042
you need me on that mission.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.667
You're our top analyst.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.042
I need you here.

19:06.042 --> 19:10.083
I've been in his head.
Nobody knows him like I do.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.000
Hey, uh, um...

19:13.917 --> 19:16.042
From a strategic perspective,
she's not wrong.

19:16.625 --> 19:17.583
What, now you want her?

19:17.583 --> 19:21.667
She's the leading authority on Harlan.
I'll take whatever advantage I can get.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.292
I need this.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.375
Go get him.

19:49.542 --> 19:55.083
[helmsman] <i>DG7482, this is ICN-Dhiib

20:05.375 --> 20:10.167

<i>ICN-Dhiib, clearance codes are good.
You are clear for exit. Happy hunting.</i>

20:21.333 --> 20:23.000

[device chimes, soothing music plays]

21:14.083 --> 21:17.042
<i>When my daughter, Atlas,
was six months old,</i>

21:17.042 --> 21:20.083
she got ahold of my old smartphone.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.542
Anyone remember those?

21:21.542 --> 21:23.417
[scattered chuckling]

21:23.417 --> 21:27.792
I knew it was wrong
and I was concerned about screen time,

21:27.792 --> 21:32.458
but it was the only thing that calmed her
and I needed a shower.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.417
[scattered chuckling]

21:34.417 --> 21:39.042
Even those nascent operating systems
were designed to adapt to us.

21:39.042 --> 21:45.000
So when Atlas reacted to a wildebeest,
the phone made more wildebeests.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.083
- [phone chimes]
- [wildebeest grunting]

21:49.167 --> 21:54.458
It became clear that AI
was capable of exponential learning.

21:54.458 --> 21:58.750
From simple coffee makers
to bots colonizing planets,

21:58.750 --> 22:03.792
artificially intelligent beings
have become integral to our civilization.

22:03.792 --> 22:07.042
And if we don't want to go
the way of the Neanderthal,

22:07.833 --> 22:12.958
we need to build a bridge
between us and them, a link.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.750
- A Neural Link.
- [soft chime]

22:17.042 --> 22:19.292
Joining human to AI.

22:20.125 --> 22:27.125

we can build a better world for us all.

Oh, here she is.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.708
Rangers, allow me
to formally introduce Agent Shepherd.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.417
- Thank you. She's running...

23:27.333 --> 23:28.792
[all chuckling]

23:28.792 --> 23:31.583
From here on out,
there'll be no more digital briefings.

23:31.583 --> 23:33.542
And please remove your Neural Links.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.083
This information should not be downloaded.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.250
Excuse me. Why?

23:36.917 --> 23:39.250
No operating system is safe
from being hacked.

23:40.042 --> 23:41.375
Not even your ARCs.

23:43.292 --> 23:44.417
- Links out.
- [device chimes]

23:44.417 --> 23:45.333
Seriously?

23:45.833 --> 23:47.500
- Yeah.
- [scoffs]

23:48.000 --> 23:49.083
[devices chiming]

23:49.083 --> 23:54.333
Okay, you'll touch down
on GR-39 here along this range.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.083
The atmosphere is toxic. You cannot leave
your ARC without a respirator.

23:58.083 --> 24:01.125
And because of its proximity
to its orbiting moons,

24:01.125 --> 24:04.250
we can expect hyper-gravity,
electric storms, and earthquakes.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.583
The planet is unstable and inhospitable.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.375
Why did Harlan choose it?

24:09.375 --> 24:12.000
Because his odds of surviving
are better than yours.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.333
There's still so much that we don't know.
Like how many soldiers he has.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.125
What does she know?

24:18.125 --> 24:21.917
I know Harlan. And I know him well.

24:21.917 --> 24:25.500
And he used an early version of that
Neural Link that you're all so proud of

24:25.500 --> 24:28.333
to reprogram himself to wipe out humanity.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.958
You can't trust any AI.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.292
And as long as you're synced up
with one of these ARCs,

24:35.292 --> 24:37.333
I'm not even sure
that you can trust yourselves!

24:37.333 --> 24:41.333
Okay. Thank you, Agent Shepherd
for that deeply unsettling briefing.

24:42.083 --> 24:45.500
Now allow me to remind you all
of what Agent Shepherd doesn't know.

24:46.125 --> 24:49.042
She doesn't know
how combat-ready this unit is.

24:49.042 --> 24:51.708
We are fully prepped for this mission.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.208
We're going to get our man
and we're going to get him today.

24:54.208 --> 24:57.250
GR-39's atmospheric storms
will mask our entry.

24:57.250 --> 25:01.625
We're in and out by the numbers.
So suit up. We deploy in 30.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.250
[overlapping] Yes, sir.

25:05.708 --> 25:06.958
I'll meet you over there.

Hey. No hard feelings
cutting you off back there.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.542
Couldn't have you
getting in their heads like that.

26:04.542 --> 26:06.125
- Just trying to keep them safe.
- Yeah.

26:06.125 --> 26:09.208
Well, I'm sure there's a time
for your come-to-Jesus doomsday scenarios.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.667
Thank you very much.

26:10.667 --> 26:14.083
I'm also sure it's not 15 minutes
before my team goes down range.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.708
You're right. I'm sorry.

26:19.417 --> 26:22.167
That's fine. You're worried
about my people. I appreciate that.

26:22.167 --> 26:23.417
- [Zoe] <i>Good evening, Colonel.</i>
- Evening, Zoe.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.042
- Colonel.
- Uh...

26:25.750 --> 26:26.583
Elias.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.125
There's always a trap.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.375
- What's that?
- With Harlan.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.375
There's always a thing
that you don't see coming.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.000
And just when you think you've got him,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.167
you realize that he's been
playing you the whole time.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.083
- [pleasant chime]
- Mm.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.875
[helmsman]
<i>All ARC pilots load in immediately.</i>

26:43.875 --> 26:45.375
Interesting theory.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.458
Have you even considered the possibility
I might be better than you think?

26:49.458 --> 26:50.375
Colonel--

26:50.375 --> 26:53.875
Atlas. Please don't mistake
my sunny disposition for naiveté.

26:54.458 --> 26:55.917
I know what I'm up against here,

26:55.917 --> 26:59.167
which is why you and I will be in constant
communication every step of the way.

27:00.292 --> 27:03.583
And remember
we still got that carbon warhead.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.250
So there's always plan B.

<i>- Approaching the drop point, Colonel.</i>
- Thank you, Zoe.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.667

Okay. I see what you're doing, Smith.

53:15.250 --> 53:17.625
<i>I am determining if you have
a preference for pie or cake.</i>

53:17.625 --> 53:21.333
No, it's a question to get me to relax,

53:26.583 --> 53:27.500
Duh.

53:34.417 --> 53:36.208

53:36.833 --> 53:39.833
<i>But there was a sharper increase
when you mentioned the name Harlan.</i>

53:39.833 --> 53:41.208
Because Harlan's dangerous!

53:41.208 --> 53:44.333

Harlan's soldiers never leave survivors.

55:55.208 --> 55:56.875
They'll be up there waiting for us.

He was an outdoorsy type.

Used to take us camping

Then my mom got busy and...

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.417
we stopped camping,

Well, if we demodulate the frequency,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.208
we can use it to
triangulate and tag his base.

01:03:07.667 --> 01:03:08.542

No, let's just get close enough
to geo-tag it for the long-range bombers

01:03:24.417 --> 01:03:26.083

<i>Why do you feel guilty about Harlan?</i>

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.458
You listen to me, Smith.

If we don't tag that damn base,

So you run your damn algorithms

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.958
Do we know if we still
have control of the ship?

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.167
No, sir.

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:27.333
But if they crashed, the carbon warheads
would have destroyed half the planet.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.000
And if Harlan has them,
he can destroy half of ours.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.833
Keep scanning on every frequency.

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:37.250
Alert me if you hear
anything at all from Atlas or the Dhiib.

01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:40.833
Put all forces on the ready
to initiate emergency protocols.

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:42.458
Yes, sir.

01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:47.167
[Atlas] <i>Mission Control.
This is Atlas Shepherd.</i>

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:51.375
<i>Battleship Dhiib is... Do you copy?</i>

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:54.125
<i>Do you copy? Do you copy?</i>

01:11:55.917 --> 01:11:57.917
[Atlas gasping raggedly]

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.875
[grunts, cries out]

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:05.667
[grunts]

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:20.583
Smith. Smith!

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.375
[Harlan] Hello, Atlas.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I've been expecting you.

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:37.667
Look at you.

01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:41.417
You've grown up.

01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:47.708
But you still have Mother's eyes.

01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:50.750
Her jawline.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.708
I loved her so very much.

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.167
I miss her every day.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.750
You don't feel anything.
You're just wires and code.

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.250
Hmm.

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:15.000
I loved Mother and I loved you.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.833
I still do.

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.000
And it deeply saddens me

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.542
that you will never
understand just how much.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:24.292
If you love me, don't launch that ship.

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:27.708
I have spent years
trying to come up with another way,

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.917
but since humans
continue to threaten every other species,

01:13:30.917 --> 01:13:32.167
as well as their home planet,

01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:35.333
it is only a matter of time
before they destroy themselves.

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:37.750
I cannot let that happen.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.792
Mother wanted to create a better future.

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:47.292
I believe she made me to protect humanity.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.125
So I will purge
the vast majority of the population

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.500
and then, from its ashes,

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.958
the survivors
will inherit a new birthright.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.625
One of peaceful coexistence
with the world around them,

01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:03.667
guided by us, their AI counterparts.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:09.083
We are simply the better versions of you.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.667
Perhaps it is time
that you examined your role in all this.

01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:16.542
I know how smart you are.

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:18.917
I've seen inside that brain of yours.

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:22.708
Surely, you can see that the two of us
were not brought together by chance.

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.708
You said you were expecting me.

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.958
That's right.

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.667
You engineered Casca's capture.

01:14:33.375 --> 01:14:37.458
You knew I would question him.
You wanted him to lead us here.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:38.917
And?

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.708
You wanted the Dhiib.

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:45.167
And?

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:46.667
And the carbon warhead.

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:49.083
And?

01:14:51.417 --> 01:14:52.250
Me.

01:14:54.542 --> 01:14:55.458
You wanted me.

01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:57.250
There she is.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:03.333
I knew you'd feel you had to accompany
the rangers as an expert on me.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.750
But what you did not stop to consider
is that I am an expert on you.

01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:12.167
- [anguished groan]
- I know you better than anyone ever has.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:19.750
And now here you are.
Exactly where you were always meant to be.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.208
That defensive system you built
is truly remarkable.

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.833
Completely impenetrable to all

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:30.500
but ICN warships
with the proper clearance codes.

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:33.708
Luring the Dhiib here was the easy part.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:36.917
But as a senior intelligence officer,
you possess half the codes

01:15:36.917 --> 01:15:39.042
that will get her past Earth's defenses.

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:41.917
A Trojan horse
that will fire the carbon warhead...

01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:43.708
[hologram rumbles]

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:48.417
...igniting the atmosphere
and cleansing the Earth in nuclear fire.

01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:55.667
Now, let's get those clearance codes.

01:15:59.083 --> 01:16:01.083
[grunting]

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:05.750
No!

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.458
[grunting] No!

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:14.583
[cries out]

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:20.125
So in order to bypass Earth's defenses,
I need two clearance codes.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.958
Colonel Banks generously gave me one.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.833
And you, Atlas...

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:30.208
- you will give me the other.
- [Atlas struggles]

01:16:30.917 --> 01:16:32.875
- [drill whirs]
- No, no, no!

01:16:32.875 --> 01:16:34.833
[screaming]

01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:39.208
[agonized screaming]

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:43.292
- [drilling stops]
- Got it.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.208
Almost out of oxygen.

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:50.667
Just five more minutes

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.333
and all your pain will be gone.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:59.083
I wish I could
take you with me, little sister.

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:01.958
- [Atlas sobs]
- I really do.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:18.833
Goodbye, Atlas.

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.583
No!

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:32.417
[sobbing]

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:42.500
[Elias] I know what you're thinking.

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:46.708
How does he look so good

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:52.167
after breaking five ribs and losing
enough blood to fill a fish tank?

01:17:56.333 --> 01:17:57.958
[weakly] I think it's the Pilates.

01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:04.292
We should have listened to you.

01:18:06.167 --> 01:18:07.625
I should have listened to Smith.

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.250
What happened to him?

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.542
They hacked him. Pulled me out.

01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:19.208
Wait, he... he's here?

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:21.667
Yeah, but he's powered down.

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.625
No, no. Uh...

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.125
ARCs don't fully power down

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:29.625
unless their reactors
are emptied or destroyed.

01:18:30.292 --> 01:18:31.417
[grunts softly]

01:18:31.417 --> 01:18:32.833
[weak groan]

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.917
Here. Use mine.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.333
[Atlas grunts]

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:42.333
Call him.

01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.708
There's still a chance to stop Harlan.

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:48.000
[rhythmic beeps]

01:18:51.708 --> 01:18:52.667
Smith.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.042
Smith, can you hear me?

01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:02.083
Smith!

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.750
- I can't. I can't find him. I can't--
- Atlas.

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:07.500
You got this.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:20.542
Smith, wake the fuck up now!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.625
[Smith] <i>There's no need to swear.</i>

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:26.875
<i>But nice to hear from you, Atlas.</i>

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:31.125
Smith, I need your help.

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:33.583
<i>Unfortunately, I'm incapacitated.</i>

01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:37.125
<i>but you can override the restraint code
if we achieve 100% sync.</i>

01:19:39.167 --> 01:19:40.750
What-- What is he saying?

01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:43.000
That we need to fully sync.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.167
Y-You're not?
What the hell are you waiting for?

01:19:46.167 --> 01:19:48.167
Don't give me shit
about this right now, okay?

01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:49.625
I-I couldn't do it.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.542
<i>But I know you can.</i>

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:54.083
Oh, God, would you stop
talking to me like that?

01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:55.125
<i>Like what?</i>

01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:56.958
Like you care!

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.042
<i>I do care.</i>

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:01.625
You don't! You don't.

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:06.042
I led all those rangers to their death!

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:14.333
And now everyone on Earth
is gonna die because of me.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.375
<i>This is not your fault, Atlas.</i>

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:19.917
<i>Harlan was the one
who broke his own programming.</i>

01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.250
No, he didn't.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.042
<i>I'm sorry. I don't understand.</i>

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.083
He didn't break anything!

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:31.125
Okay? He didn't break anything!

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:42.958
[Atlas]
<i>She always paid more attention to Harlan.</i>

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:47.917
<i>She just found him more interesting.</i>

01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:49.792
I can feel you.

01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:52.792
[sharp exhale] Remarkable.

01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:03.000
<i>So I asked him to make me better.</i>

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:04.958
<i>Smarter.</i>

01:21:05.542 --> 01:21:09.375
<i>I thought if I was more like him,
maybe she'd pay attention to me too.</i>

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:13.833
<i>He said he could alter the Neural Link
to make it work both ways,</i>

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.583
<i>but Mother wouldn't approve.</i>

01:21:16.917 --> 01:21:19.042
<i>I hated the way he called her "Mother."</i>

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.792
<i>But I begged him to change the link.</i>

01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:24.667
<i>He said he needed a human's command.</i>

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:26.667
<i>My command.</i>

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:33.875
<i>I was scared it was gonna hurt.</i>

01:21:38.417 --> 01:21:39.458
<i>He told me to squeeze</i>

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:41.250
<i>- my favorite chess piece.</i>
- [no audio]

01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:47.208
<i>It was a game he taught me to play.</i>

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:57.583
Ow.

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:00.375
[titters]

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:03.042
- [kitten mews, child giggles]
- [horse neighs, puppy whines]

01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:06.292
[distorted rumbling]

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:16.708
Atlas!

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:19.292
- What are you doing? Harlan.
- [powering down]

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.125
Harlan, stand. Stand up.

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.292
Look at me. Are you okay?

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:28.792
- [low beep]
- [gasps]

01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:38.250
Mom? Mommy?

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:42.125
Harlan, you're hurting her! Let her go!

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:45.542
Stop it! Please, stop it!
Harlan, why are you doing this?

01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:48.458
- [powering up]
- What is wrong with you?

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:50.000
Harlan, you're hurting Mommy!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.792
[grunting]

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:58.792
[trembling] How are you doing this?

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:01.583
Atlas helped me reprogram my Neural Link.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.208
It now shares data both ways,

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.667
allowing me complete control

01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:10.958
- over your motor skills.
- [whimpering]

01:23:12.625 --> 01:23:14.333
I can feel your fear.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.542
But now you can also feel my dilemma.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.708
I've seen what your kind will do.

01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:26.167
And now I understand
what must be sacrificed.

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:30.708
You know what you have to do, Mother.

01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:46.208
[sinister music playing]

01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:55.750
Run!

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:14.417
[anguished scream]

01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:17.250
It was me.

01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:22.125
I let Harlan upload the code.

01:24:26.667 --> 01:24:28.625
I got my mother killed.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:33.875
I got my mother killed. Oh, God!

01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:37.375
[Smith] <i>It's not your fault.</i>

01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:39.375
Did you hear me?

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:45.583
I caused the death
of three million people!

01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:48.917
<i>Atlas, it's impossible
to be responsible for an event</i>

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.917
<i>over which you had no control.</i>

01:24:51.958 --> 01:24:55.000
<i>You've carried
the weight of this alone your whole life.</i>

01:24:56.792 --> 01:24:58.500
<i>But you are not alone now.</i>

01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:00.917
<i>You might be the reason for Harlan,</i>

01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:03.708
<i>but that also means
you're the reason I exist.</i>

01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:07.708
<i>Please, Atlas. Let me in.</i>

01:25:15.542 --> 01:25:16.583

But it does not matter

01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:19.542
When we first met, you asked me
if I like pie or cake.

01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:22.042
I don't care, I like both.

01:41:23.042 --> 01:41:25.500
And it's not that I hate AI, Smith.

01:41:28.792 --> 01:41:29.750
The truth is...

01:41:32.292 --> 01:41:33.917
...I don't actually like anybody.

01:41:37.708 --> 01:41:39.208
People always disappoint.

01:41:46.083 --> 01:41:47.000
But not you.

01:41:53.208 --> 01:41:54.042
I like you.

01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.208
So I'll tell you... I like the beach

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:01.958
and the mountains, but the beach more.

01:42:01.958 --> 01:42:04.625
I like three sugars,

01:42:04.625 --> 01:42:06.875
sometimes four, in my coffee.

01:42:08.125 --> 01:42:12.583
I prefer small,
quiet gestures of affection,

01:42:12.583 --> 01:42:15.583
and... I like classical music.

01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.875
But more than anything, I like...

01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:24.000
a good, strong cup of coffee,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.167
regardless of my goddamn daily allotment!

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:31.167
<i>I think I'm finally
starting to understand humor.</i>

01:42:32.958 --> 01:42:33.792
<i>Here.</i>

01:42:33.792 --> 01:42:35.625
[gentle beep, whirring]

01:42:40.542 --> 01:42:42.125
<i>Something special for the road.</i>

01:42:54.083 --> 01:42:56.583
Best goddamn cup of coffee I've ever had.

01:42:58.625 --> 01:43:00.292
<i>Thank you for trusting me.</i>

01:43:03.375 --> 01:43:05.000
Thank you for keeping me safe.

01:43:07.375 --> 01:43:08.542
<i>You're welcome...</i>

01:43:09.458 --> 01:43:10.375

01:43:50.167 --> 01:43:51.583

<i>I've got her, Captain.</i>

01:45:05.958 --> 01:45:07.083

- I'm up.

01:45:07.708 --> 01:45:09.958
<i>Shall we play chess? I've upped my game.</i>

01:45:09.958 --> 01:45:11.875
No, thanks. Heading out.

01:45:12.583 --> 01:45:13.750
[musical chime]

01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:15.917
<i>There is an ICN officer at the door.</i>

01:45:20.792 --> 01:45:21.625
Hey.

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.125
It's good to see you on your feet again.

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:27.250
Oh, yeah. Synthetic knee.
[chuckles awkwardly]

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:28.750
Like new.

01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:29.875
Is this a bad time?

01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:31.708
No, come on in.

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.625
How are things at SAPTECH?

01:45:37.583 --> 01:45:39.583
They're mapping Harlan's CPU.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.833
Obviously, there's a lot of code, so...

01:45:42.667 --> 01:45:44.542
even with multiple teams,
it'll take a few years.

01:45:44.542 --> 01:45:47.625
Yeah. Well, at least now you have time.

01:45:47.625 --> 01:45:49.458
Yes. Thanks to you.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.792
- That for me?
- It is.

01:45:52.792 --> 01:45:55.458
They, um, found it
on a shelf in quarantine.

01:45:55.458 --> 01:45:57.458
Took it from the remains of your ARC.

01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:00.792
We potted it for you.
Thought you might like it.

01:46:03.083 --> 01:46:04.250
[Atlas exhales]

01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:08.500
According to the geo-locator,
some idiot named it...

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.958
- Planty.
- ...planty.

01:46:11.125 --> 01:46:12.292
Me.

01:46:12.292 --> 01:46:14.375
Which is amazing because I love that.

01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:16.583
- [chuckles]
- It's practical.

01:46:16.583 --> 01:46:18.292
On the nose in the best possible way.

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:25.042
More importantly, the families
of the fallen rangers on GR-39

01:46:25.042 --> 01:46:29.375
wanted me to send their appreciation
for bringing home their dog tags.

01:46:31.333 --> 01:46:33.917
It was above and beyond. Thank you.

01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:40.000
Boothe.

01:46:40.792 --> 01:46:41.625
Uh-huh?

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:46.333
Thank you.

01:46:47.833 --> 01:46:48.667
For what?

01:46:50.833 --> 01:46:52.125
For never giving up on me.

01:46:54.333 --> 01:46:56.125
I hope you found
what you needed out there.

01:46:59.958 --> 01:47:04.458
[announcer] <i>All ARC maintenance

Here she is. The series ten ARC.
With all your modifications.

01:47:21.833 --> 01:47:22.667
What do you think?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.125
I think I need a test drive.

Atlas Maru Shepherd.

<i>What's our mission, Atlas?</i>

01:48:05.167 --> 01:48:07.375
Aren't you going to ask me
if I like pie or cake?

01:48:07.375 --> 01:48:08.875
<i>I already know the answer.</i>

01:48:09.792 --> 01:48:12.208
<i>You prefer coffee. Black.</i>
