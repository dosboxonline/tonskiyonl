WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.549
Is the new stove coming today?
Is it Stove Day?

00:06.549 --> 00:08.634
Merry Stove Day, Jeff.

00:08.634 --> 00:11.262
And we're not getting
just any old stove.

00:11.262 --> 00:15.766
Le Bon Chaud is the fanciest
French stove money can buy.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.143
Ooh-la-la.

00:17.143 --> 00:18.853
You've heard of
<i>Emily in Paris,</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:20.896
but have you heard of Steve
in an apron?

00:20.896 --> 00:23.441
Did someone order a new stove?

00:23.441 --> 00:26.110
That cheap piece of crap's
not Le Bon Chaud.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.946
That European stove
you wanted was way overpriced.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.239
What the hell, Dad?

00:30.239 --> 00:32.616
I invited Nerfer over
to make scrambled eggs.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.452
I'm gonna look like
a damn fool.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.997
Does anyone else
hear a loud hiss?

00:39.623 --> 00:42.251
Obviously just a stove snake.
Calm down.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.128
Huh. That hose
shouldn't be there.

00:57.183 --> 01:00.102
Hey, Candace. Yep.
Stan bought another appliance.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.437
Better send
the big ambulance.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.272
It's the whole family
this time.

01:06.358 --> 01:09.069
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:12.656
<i>♪ I got a feeling
That it's gonna be
A wonderful day ♪</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:15.451
<i>♪ The sun in the sky

01:15.451 --> 01:18.662
<i>♪ And he's shining a salute

01:22.082 --> 01:25.169
<i>♪ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ♪</i>

01:25.169 --> 01:27.213
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:27.213 --> 01:28.631
Ah!

01:30.466 --> 01:33.219
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:36.180 --> 01:37.765
You are all very lucky.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.351
I have never
in my entire career
as a doctor

01:40.351 --> 01:42.853
seen a family this severely
deprived of oxygen.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.065
First day being a doctor,
so I've been saying
stuff like that a lot.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.442
Okay, Smiths,
time for your diagnosis.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.112
You're all going to live.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.158
Wow. We almost died.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.702
Yeah, it really puts things
in perspective.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.747
We need to start living
our lives to the fullest

02:01.747 --> 02:04.083
and do all the things
that we've been putting off.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.711
I always wanted to try
the Tiny Tacos from
Jack in the Box.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.089
And you know what?
I'm gonna go for it.

02:10.089 --> 02:13.384
I'm finally gonna start
wearing low-rise jeans,

02:13.384 --> 02:15.761
even though Barry says
I don't have the ass for it.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.931
My whole life,
I've had a dream.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.559
It has captivated
my imagination,

02:21.559 --> 02:25.604
and enthralled me,
but it has also frightened me.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.900
<i>Everest, the highest peak
on Earth.</i>

02:29.900 --> 02:33.320
<i>The ultimate test
of human will.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.447
<i>Many have died trying.</i>

02:35.447 --> 02:40.327
<i>But those who reach the summit
have achieved true greatness.</i>

02:40.327 --> 02:43.539
As mountaineer
Sir Edmund Hillary said,

02:43.539 --> 02:47.334
"It's not the mountain
we conquer but ourselves."

02:48.502 --> 02:50.546
Mine sounds stupid now.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.506
- I wanna do Mom's thing.
- Yeah, me too.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.216
I want to get super high.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.052
This family
is going to conquer
Mount Everest.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.933
In that case,
I'd better write you
a prescription for adventure.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.980
Isn't it wonderful how things
work out?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.273
You need to book a trip,

03:09.273 --> 03:13.152
and it's the grand opening
of my travel agency.

03:13.152 --> 03:16.947
Can I offer you
a water, coffee,
maybe a glass of champagne?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.824
Lovely. I'll take all three.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.285
You called my bluff.
I don't have any
of those beverages.

03:21.285 --> 03:25.289
But what I can offer you
is the trip of a lifetime.

03:25.289 --> 03:29.877
I've done my research, and
here's what an Everest climb
package costs.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.546
Wow. That's a lot.
But I could work some overtime

03:32.546 --> 03:34.715
and maybe look into
starting an OnlyFans account.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.467
Obviously, just tasteful solo
stuff.

03:36.467 --> 03:39.136
That's the per person charge.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.931
This is the whole enchilada.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.141
That enchilada
is too many tamales.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.727
Don't panic.
Klaus has an alternative.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.354
Thank goodness. What is it?

03:48.354 --> 03:51.523
Zorbing. Sport of the future.

03:51.523 --> 03:55.778
Klaus, focus. Maybe there's
a more affordable mountain
we could climb.

03:55.778 --> 03:59.239
This Mount Chimborazo
is really cheap.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.618
- Not sure I can recommend--
- Chimborazo it is.

04:02.618 --> 04:03.994
Oh-ho!

04:03.994 --> 04:06.914
It says here that
because of the
equatorial bulge,

04:06.914 --> 04:11.377
the summit of Chimborazo is
actually the closest point on
Earth to the sun.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.712
Of course,
the equatorial bulge.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.382
That's super, because
I'm an OG bulge boy.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.592
Ride or die.
Bulge boys, mount up.

04:18.592 --> 04:22.054
And I ain't exactly
complaining about
the proximity to the sun.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.059
Why are we flying
on Air Ecuador?

04:27.059 --> 04:29.728
Air Ecuador doesn't only fly
to Ecuador,

04:29.728 --> 04:32.356
like how
Southwest doesn't only
fly to the southwest.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.359
And Virgin Air doesn't just
fly to your bedroom. Boom.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.029
I'm not feeling my look today.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.991
You ever walk out of
the house and realize
you look like an idiot?

04:41.991 --> 04:43.492
I mean,
this guy knows how I feel.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.539
You still haven't told
the family they're not
going to Everest?

04:48.539 --> 04:51.709
I'm waiting for the perfect
moment. I'm thinking right
at the summit.

04:51.709 --> 04:54.378
Well, good luck with that.
I'm gonna go hit on divorcees

04:54.378 --> 04:57.506
in the glass-walled smoking
section that looks like
a futuristic prison.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.386
Well, I somehow
made it even worse.

05:02.386 --> 05:05.222
I am pumped for this.
I mean, it's Everest.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.016
Nothing else can compare.

05:07.016 --> 05:11.145
Technically, everything
can be compared.
That's how comparing works.

05:11.145 --> 05:14.189
Have you noticed that Dad's
acting a little weird?
Watch this.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.775
I sure am excited
to climb Everest.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.485
It's cool to be up
really high.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.905
But it's more important,
at least to me, to be close
to the sun.

05:21.905 --> 05:24.199
Dad, why do you keep
talking about the sun?

05:24.199 --> 05:26.577
I'm not doing that.
Hey, switching subjects.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.872
Did you know that
one million Earths
would fit inside the sun?

05:29.872 --> 05:32.207
Stan, what the hell
is going on?

05:32.207 --> 05:34.501
- We're going
to Everest, right?
- Klaus.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.924
Well, I was gonna
wait for the summit,
but you ruined my surprise.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.927
We are going
to Mount Chimborazo.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.556
And the crowd goes wild.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.642
Stan, I wanted
to go to Everest.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.979
I wanted to stand
on the highest point.

05:53.979 --> 05:57.357
If you talk about
the sun one more time,
I will cut your tongue out.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.987
We almost died
and vowed to live life
to the fullest,

06:01.987 --> 06:05.616
and you bring us
to Mount Chin-beard-rat-turd.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.993
Was it the money,
you damn cheapskate?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.788
Dad, I hate you.
You're so annoying.
How dare you?

06:10.788 --> 06:15.084
<i>All I wanted was
to get my family close to
the sun on a budget.</i>

06:15.084 --> 06:17.336
Come on.
<i>- I don't understand why
they're so mad.</i>

06:17.336 --> 06:21.131
<i>I almost suspect
they're unfamiliar
with the equatorial bulge.</i>

06:25.844 --> 06:28.931
We should probably hit
the sack. Gotta get up early
for our big climb.

06:28.931 --> 06:32.142
We are not climbing
that dinky little mountain.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.269
Come on, kids.
Let's go get drunk.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.439
That's "Bye, Felicia"
in Sherpa.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.857
Which I learned for nothing.

06:40.234 --> 06:44.238
Everyone is being
so mean to me
about Chimborazo.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.824
Stan, we can still turn
this trip around.

06:46.824 --> 06:50.577
I took it upon myself
to book you all
a 5:00 a.m. Zorb.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.624
Someone has forgotten
what Zorbing is.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.629
What's with this music?

07:00.629 --> 07:03.632
Would it kill this dude
to play some Alice In Chains?

07:04.967 --> 07:08.053
Another round of drinks
for our foreign visitors,

07:08.053 --> 07:12.307
and I also made
little paintings
of each of you.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.726
A souvenir of your trip.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.729
My God.
How do we get rid
of this dingleberry?

07:17.729 --> 07:20.232
I don't know.
He's kind of got a cool style.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.652
If you need anything else,
don't hesitate to call
my name.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.445
Vicente.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.616
Are we really gonna climb
this lame-ass mountain?

07:29.616 --> 07:34.037
No. You cannot climb
Chimborazo this time of year.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.624
Very dangerous.
Certain death.

07:37.624 --> 07:41.003
Stan, did you know
this mountain was
a death trap?

07:41.670 --> 07:42.713
Stan's gone.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.798
A few hours ago,
he up and left, mumbling,

07:44.798 --> 07:48.677
"Screw the family.
I'm gonna climb Chimborazo
on my own."

07:50.804 --> 07:55.517
We must go after your father
and find him before he meets
his death on the mountain.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.438
Prepare yourself
for the climb.
We leave at dawn.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.981
Let's just leave now.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.942
I hate going to bed
then having to get up
all groggy.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I totally agree.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.197
No, we leave at dawn.

08:08.197 --> 08:12.534
Dawn is when you leave
to climb a mountain, Jeff.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.037
Vicente knows my name.

08:17.789 --> 08:21.418
Ow! Hey, Vicente, are you
getting a lot of rocks
in your sandals?

08:22.211 --> 08:24.046
Yeah, me neither.

08:24.046 --> 08:28.759
I'm so annoyed your dumb
father is climbing this stump
of a mountain.

08:28.759 --> 08:32.346
You know, technically,
because of the
equatorial bulge--

08:38.352 --> 08:41.355
Hey, I'm thirsty.
Did anybody bring any water?

08:41.355 --> 08:42.814
Not to worry.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.609
Chimborazo has many treats
for travelers.

08:45.609 --> 08:50.656
But watch out, because
sometimes the travelers
become the treats.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.367
Whoa.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.619
- Can I keep this knife?
- No.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.375
Eh. I prefer
grapefruit LaCroix.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.670
Because of the
volcanic activity below

09:04.670 --> 09:06.338
and the grapefruit
orchard above,

09:06.338 --> 09:09.341
- this stream--
- Tastes just like
grapefruit LaCroix.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.552
Call me when you have
a Sierra Mist river.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.138
Chimborazo,
she is a dangerous slut.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.974
- Jeff, watch out.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.559
Sorry. I thought that tree
behind you was a monster.

09:19.559 --> 09:24.982
- Can I have this knife?
- No, man. It's not, like,
free knife day.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.151
I recently guided an artist
from Pixar up the mountain.

09:28.151 --> 09:32.614
He was thinking of setting
the next Pixar movie
on Chimborazo.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.492
About a country alpaca
that moves down
the mountains

09:35.492 --> 09:38.829
and gets bullied by a bunch
of mean city alpacas.

09:38.829 --> 09:43.458
Alpaca pillow to that movie,
because it sounds
like a snooze.

09:50.132 --> 09:53.176
Hello, Esmeralda.
Klaus Heissler.

09:53.176 --> 09:58.056
I need to cancel
all seven of the Zorb
sessions that I booked.

09:58.056 --> 10:02.728
I'm sorry. You booked
our non-refundable
Zorb experiences.

10:02.728 --> 10:06.940
I can offer you a credit.
You could use it for
a helicopter tour, or--

10:06.940 --> 10:09.901
Look, hon, you're not
dealing with some
tourist schmuck.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.155
- I'm a travel agent.
- You seem like
a tourist schmuck.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.198
I just told you
I wasn't one of those.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.784
Okay, that's it.
Let's settle this like adults.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.164
Adults inside Zorbs.
I challenge you
to a Zorb fight.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.832
I accept.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.710
But only because
I feel like humiliating
a fish today.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.378
Joke's on you.

10:28.378 --> 10:32.382
Being humiliated by
a beautiful woman
is a huge turn-on for me.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.054
Well, sure.
This view is a little
magnificent, I guess.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.264
Yeah, and I have to say,

10:39.264 --> 10:42.642
I didn't mind that meadow
back there that smelled
like fresh waffles.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.896
Family meeting right now.
I know what's happening.

10:45.896 --> 10:49.232
You're starting
to have a good time.
Well, knock it off.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.360
Climbing Everest
was the dream,

10:51.360 --> 10:54.571
and yet your father
brought us to Chimbo-Crapo.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.907
Right. Dad always
does stuff like this,

10:56.907 --> 10:59.659
and we start having fun
and let him off the hook,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.370
but not this time, <i>capisce?</i>

11:01.370 --> 11:04.498
I could go for
a <i>capisce</i> right now.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.209
Hungry? The mountain,
she provides.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.002
This whole mountain is edible.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.879
Mmm.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.297
No. That's just dirt.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.846
- How is it? Bad, right?
- Yeah.

11:19.846 --> 11:24.518
Unless you're into perfectly
cooked and seasoned meat
that melts in your mouth.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.731
Oh, a cute little monkey.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.150
I think it looks like
Richard Nixon.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.986
You're right.
And probably
just as big a liar.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.823
I'll bet he wants
to take us off
the gold standard too.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.868
That was just
a little joke nobody got.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.662
I love you.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.212
Fear not.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.715
The mountain, she will
provide us shelter from
the passing storm.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.676
Yes. Mother mountain.

11:57.676 --> 12:01.096
She will nestle us
in the cleavage
of her rock-hard tits.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.806
Ahhh!

12:02.806 --> 12:05.058
Chimborazo, she is
a dangerous slut.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.483
Where are we?

12:13.483 --> 12:17.779
Inside a crystal geode
that has grown within
the mountain for eons.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.408
Some call this
the heart of Chimborazo.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.412
I have to admit,
I feel a little good.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.582
It is believed
that these crystals
have healing powers.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.002
It's how I've managed
to stay in such good shape

12:32.002 --> 12:34.463
even though
I am 97 years old.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.842
Okay. I can't
fight it anymore.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.136
I'm having a wonderful time.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.055
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
I love this mountain.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.765
But when we find
your father,

12:45.765 --> 12:48.185
we can't tell him
that we enjoyed
ourselves, okay?

12:48.185 --> 12:50.228
I'm still very mad at him.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.023
I mean, pretty mad. I think.

12:53.648 --> 12:54.691
I don't know.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.111
I feel so amazing
in this [bleep] cave.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.490
Come. The rain has passed.
We must go.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.742
Too long in here,
you turn into a baby.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.036
Dad.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.747
Look who decided to climb
the crappy mountain that
no one likes

13:08.747 --> 13:10.665
to find the dad
that everyone hates.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.418
You're alive.
But you look terrible.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.045
This mountain is hell.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.589
I crossed a river of sulfur,
bramble fields,

13:17.589 --> 13:19.382
and there were
so many spiders.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.010
Sounds like
you traveled through

13:22.010 --> 13:26.056
El Valle Azufre
de Aranas y Zarzas.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.475
The Sulfurous Brambly Valley
of Spiders.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.685
I see you made a friend.
That's fun.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.146
I met a pack of wolves
that stole my shoes.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.191
Stan, I'm sorry that
you had a tough time.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.109
But that doesn't
change the fact--

13:38.109 --> 13:40.904
No. I will not stand for this.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.990
I must defend the honor
of this broken man.

13:43.990 --> 13:49.037
Everyone can tell
he is a simple working man
that makes very little money.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.872
I mean, I do all right.

13:50.872 --> 13:54.668
He tries his best to provide
his family with fun,
affordable vacation.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.419
And what do you people do?

13:56.419 --> 13:59.464
You complain about everything.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.884
Yeah. Oh, man.
I spit on my sandals.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.178
I can't lie.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.765
The truth is we've had
a wonderful time.

14:08.765 --> 14:13.061
- We love Chimborazo.
- I've secretly treasured
every moment.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.730
And I love this monkey!

14:15.730 --> 14:18.984
I can't wait to tell
everyone I know
about this place.

14:18.984 --> 14:22.529
Oh, yeah.
Everybody is gonna
hear about this mountain.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.865
As soon as I have service,
I'm gonna blow Instagram up.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.201
- Click.
- That's not a click.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.537
This is a click.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.957
- I'm partial to clacks myself.
- Enough.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.875
Vicente, what are you doing?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.877
I am doing my job.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.255
My real job.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.341
You see,
I am not actually
a sexy waiter

14:43.341 --> 14:45.302
or a super-hot mountain guide.

14:45.302 --> 14:49.514
I am the protector
of Chimborazo.

14:51.266 --> 14:56.646
And as the protector
of Chimborazo,
I must kill you all.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.357
Because I took a dump
in that crystal cave?

14:59.357 --> 15:01.443
You did what?

15:01.443 --> 15:05.905
I must kill you to keep this
sacred place from being ruined
like Everest has been.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.783
I won't let it be flooded
with stupid tourists.

15:08.783 --> 15:13.913
And thus, your family
cannot live to tell the tale
of Chimborazo.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.709
As we say in Ecuador,
"Sowwy".

15:20.795 --> 15:25.300
Secret protector
of the mountain? Boring.
I've lost all interest.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.385
I was hoping his secret
was something impressive,

15:27.385 --> 15:28.637
like he could blow himself.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.263
Where are you taking us,
Vicente?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.224
To El Culo del
Diablo que Pica.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.644
The Devil's Itchy Butthole.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.563
Where I'm going to throw you
into a pit of hot magma.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.232
We never would have
told anybody about this place,

15:41.232 --> 15:43.151
until you made us
fall in love with it.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.111
I always end up doing this.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.865
I feel compelled
to show people
the beauty of Chimborazo,

15:48.865 --> 15:51.326
and then I feel compelled
to kill them.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.871
- Dad, do something.
- Oh, I thought I couldn't
do anything right.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.500
But now that you want me
to save your lives,
I'm Mr. Popularity.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.001
Well, okay.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.755
So weak.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.676
Maybe from the many dozens
of spider bites.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.890
Sure, sure. I know
three of these are nipples,
but it's still a lot.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.236
Phew.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.654
Okay.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.989
I know we're supposed
to be fighting, but that was--

16:29.989 --> 16:31.658
Amazing.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.910
Where'd you learn
to Zorb like that?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.788
Every night,
I have the same dream.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.499
And in the dream,
I am Zorbing.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.292
Same.

16:41.292 --> 16:45.130
I never thought
I'd find someone that loves
Zorbs as much as I do.

16:45.130 --> 16:48.007
I never thought
I'd meet such a cute fish.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.845
I'm kissing.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.681
I can't wait for you
to meet my family when
they get back with Vicente.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.267
They're with Vicente?
Oh, no.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.316
The Devil's Itchy Butthole.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.111
A suitable end
for those who would threaten

17:08.111 --> 17:11.448
the pristine beauty
of Chimborazo.

17:11.448 --> 17:15.285
But we aren't. I swear.
We would never--

17:16.453 --> 17:18.663
- My bad.
- Dad's useless.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.707
So we need to do something
about Vicente.

17:20.707 --> 17:25.295
One thing I've noticed about
Vicente, he is very horny
for this mountain.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.673
We can use his love
of the mountain against him.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.634
Yeah. We'll trick him
into showing us more
and more of the mountain

17:31.634 --> 17:33.428
until we have
a chance to escape.

17:33.428 --> 17:37.307
All right, Vicente,
you might as well just
go ahead and throw us in.

17:37.307 --> 17:41.102
We've seen all there is
to see on old Chimborazo.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.730
Oh! Far from it.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.483
She's barely pulled up
her dress for you.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.527
You're saying there's more
to this beautiful mountain?

17:49.527 --> 17:54.407
Ah! I know I should
just throw you in
the magma. But...

18:05.084 --> 18:06.795
- Whoa.
- It's incredible.

18:06.795 --> 18:11.674
These creatures
are found only here,
near the top of Chimborazo.

18:11.674 --> 18:15.970
You are one of
the few outsiders
to ever see them.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.681
Wow. Cool bird.

18:18.681 --> 18:22.310
We call that one
Feather Bent Squawkadelic.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.103
Wow. Cool name.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.691
This sleeve of enchanted
E.L. Fudges has got me
feeling right as rain.

18:28.691 --> 18:33.446
I know he wants to kill us,
but I kind of agree
with Vicente.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.658
It would be terrible
if tourists ruin
this mountain.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.785
Yeah, this place is special.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.330
Well, well, well.
Chimborazo, eh?

18:42.330 --> 18:44.165
Not such a bad idea after all.

18:44.165 --> 18:47.669
Three cheers for Stan.
Father of the year.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.754
Squawk, squawk, squawk!

18:56.135 --> 18:58.805
She really is quite
the mountain.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.308
She sure is. Wait a minute.
I just remembered.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.602
- We're about to get murdered.
- It's always something.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.521
You can never just enjoy
the moment.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.323
Pixar is back
to make their alpaca movie.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.159
This ends now.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.162
- Why don't you use your gun?
- That's not a gun.

19:23.162 --> 19:28.126
It is another amazing creature
found only on Chimborazo.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.092
This mountain
is too important.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.428
We must join Vicente
and fight for it.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.096
For Chimborazo!

19:40.096 --> 19:42.015
Squawk! Squawk!

19:43.141 --> 19:45.184
Let's beat up some nerds!

19:53.234 --> 19:57.280
Next time you'll think twice
before you mess with Pixar.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.123
- Is that--
- Guys, I met someone.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.291
I'm in love.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.084
<i>Abuelo!</i>

20:10.084 --> 20:12.879
Esmeralda, Pixar is back.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.935
- Yeah. Suck it, Pixar.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.937
I misjudged this family.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.522
You are pure of heart
and spirit.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.566
You love this mountain
as I do.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.985
I name you all henceforth

20:35.985 --> 20:39.405
fellow protectors
of Chimborazo.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.617
- Thank you, Vicente.
- Do we actually
have to do anything?

20:42.617 --> 20:47.664
With that Pixar movie shelved,
Chimborazo shall remain
a secret forever.
