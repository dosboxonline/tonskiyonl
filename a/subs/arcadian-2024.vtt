WEBVTT

03:37.739 --> 03:39.085
Yeah, it's okay.

03:39.189 --> 03:40.466
It's okay.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.813
No, it's okay, it's okay.

03:42.917 --> 03:44.021
It's okay.

04:33.381 --> 04:34.313
Come.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.816
Over the line!

05:41.173 --> 05:42.899
You're late!

05:44.210 --> 05:45.729
I'm sorry!

05:45.833 --> 05:47.110
I'm sorry I lost track of time.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.870
All right.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.009
Come on.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.999
You all right, big boy?

06:14.102 --> 06:16.035
I left one for you.

06:44.892 --> 06:46.790
Second floor.

07:05.015 --> 07:06.189
Are we safe?

07:06.292 --> 07:07.570
Yes.

07:07.673 --> 07:08.881
Are we secure?

07:08.985 --> 07:10.469
Yes.

07:12.022 --> 07:13.714
Dinnertime.

07:15.923 --> 07:17.545
Dinnertime.

07:18.684 --> 07:21.584
- That was a good one.
- Yeah, after you.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.690
Thank you for this food
we were about to receive

07:24.794 --> 07:27.210
to nourish
and strengthen our bodies.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.936
Thank you
for this beautiful day.

07:29.039 --> 07:30.144
It's ready.

07:30.247 --> 07:32.974
Thank you for bringing
us together as a family.

07:35.356 --> 07:36.219
Amen.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.738
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.398
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

07:43.502 --> 07:44.745
If you're late again,

07:44.848 --> 07:47.472
you can't go
past the boundaries.

07:48.645 --> 07:51.993
- I was helping Mr. Rose.
- I know what you were doing.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.857
Do you understand?

07:54.513 --> 07:56.481
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.897
Why'd you do it?

07:59.622 --> 08:01.037
That's not helping.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.417
Yeah. Shut up.

08:02.521 --> 08:04.765
That's not helping either.

08:08.769 --> 08:12.945
Hey, Tom, what's so special
about the Rose farm?

08:14.222 --> 08:15.914
You're not there.

08:24.060 --> 08:25.371
Hey.

08:25.475 --> 08:27.408
Hey! Hey! Stop!

08:27.512 --> 08:29.928
Stop it, stop it!

08:30.031 --> 08:31.654
Stop!

08:32.827 --> 08:34.760
What are you-- animals?

08:35.416 --> 08:37.694
You want to be animals?

08:41.802 --> 08:43.700
Are we not men?

08:48.774 --> 08:50.086
Are we not men?

08:51.397 --> 08:52.882
Are we not men?

09:16.768 --> 09:20.116
Joseph's playing chess
against himself.

09:20.737 --> 09:27.088
This is
Tal versus Koblents, 1961.

09:28.296 --> 09:30.126
And, um...

09:30.229 --> 09:33.060
Why are you doing that?

09:33.163 --> 09:35.752
Because it's interesting
to me.

09:41.586 --> 09:43.588
All right, who's who?

09:43.691 --> 09:45.451
Um...

09:45.555 --> 09:47.350
Tal's white.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.664
But that's a bishop.

09:50.767 --> 09:53.149
I'm missing a few pieces.

09:54.184 --> 09:56.221
It's a gutsy move.

09:57.394 --> 09:59.258
I like it.
- You want to play?

09:59.362 --> 10:01.502
Yeah.

10:01.606 --> 10:03.193
All right.

10:56.591 --> 10:58.697
Thomas.

12:00.172 --> 12:03.003
We'll double check the door
in the morning.

12:08.767 --> 12:10.873
Yeah, a lot of good those do.

12:10.976 --> 12:12.633
Where were you when
Dad and I ran down to the door?

12:12.737 --> 12:15.084
You could have walked down
to the door.

12:15.187 --> 12:17.500
The door was solid.
Dad locked it, I checked it.

12:17.603 --> 12:21.918
Yeah, but we have
to stay vigilant.

12:22.022 --> 12:23.955
When you were running down
the stairs,

12:24.058 --> 12:27.475
did you happen to notice how
many times they shook the door?

12:27.579 --> 12:28.683
And for how long?

12:28.787 --> 12:30.685
- No.
- Why?

12:30.789 --> 12:33.136
Well, I listened

12:33.240 --> 12:35.345
and I counted.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.037
There were three.

12:37.831 --> 12:40.488
The first was 10 seconds,

12:40.592 --> 12:42.663
the second attempt was 20,

12:42.767 --> 12:45.977
and the last one was one.

12:47.219 --> 12:48.324
Okay.

12:48.427 --> 12:49.877
So?

12:49.981 --> 12:53.363
Well, so the first was a test,

12:53.467 --> 12:55.814
and the second I think was

12:55.918 --> 12:58.299
an actual attempt
to break through the door.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.094
The third?

13:00.198 --> 13:02.062
Um...

13:04.236 --> 13:06.031
Frustration?

13:34.128 --> 13:35.785
All right, both of you,
grab hold

13:35.889 --> 13:37.787
of some of those roots.

13:37.891 --> 13:39.547
Get on either side of it.

13:39.651 --> 13:42.723
And on the count of three,
pull as hard as you can.

13:42.827 --> 13:43.862
Ready?

13:43.966 --> 13:46.520
Okay? One. Two. Three.

13:46.623 --> 13:47.832
Go!

13:49.247 --> 13:51.352
There it is!

13:52.146 --> 13:55.943
Well, is it, uh--
Is it okay if I go now?

13:57.634 --> 13:59.498
Yeah, um, cut up the bush

13:59.602 --> 14:01.328
and stack the wood by the house.

14:01.431 --> 14:03.226
Then can I go?

14:12.201 --> 14:14.099
Why do you always let him
do what he wants?

14:14.203 --> 14:16.999
You can't stop the grass
from growing.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.518
Actually, you can.

14:44.060 --> 14:47.236
You want to show me
what you've been working on?

14:50.687 --> 14:54.036
Uh, no, it's--
it's nothing.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.831
Oh, come on, you don't
wanna show your old dad

14:56.935 --> 14:59.041
what you've been up to?

15:01.112 --> 15:04.529
Ah, well,
I can't get it to start.

15:04.978 --> 15:07.256
But once it starts working,

15:07.359 --> 15:10.224
I think it'll be a big help
with work around here.

15:10.328 --> 15:12.537
Is that why you built this?

15:13.572 --> 15:15.436
Um...

15:16.403 --> 15:18.301
I don't know.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.444
I don't want to hide
from them anymore.

15:29.140 --> 15:31.452
I don't want to be scared.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.088
"There are those who believe

15:46.191 --> 15:51.265
they came after
the pollution people caused,

15:51.369 --> 15:54.372
and they're here to cleanse
the planet of the virus,

15:54.475 --> 15:55.821
of the human race.

15:55.925 --> 15:58.963
So we'll all become extinct."

16:01.413 --> 16:03.105
Well.

16:03.208 --> 16:07.454
I believe the earth
is past the worst.

16:07.557 --> 16:10.733
I think the air and the water
are getting cleaner,

16:10.836 --> 16:14.426
and I think there are
more people than we know about.

16:15.876 --> 16:18.741
And some of those people,

16:18.844 --> 16:22.538
might as well just
call them heroes,

16:22.641 --> 16:26.473
will come over the hills
and save us.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.303
That's what I believe.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.467
What happened?

16:55.571 --> 16:56.399
What'd you do?

16:56.503 --> 16:58.401
I just swapped the relays.

17:01.956 --> 17:04.269
Oh, I'm an idiot.

17:04.373 --> 17:07.238
I think you're probably
a genius.

17:09.205 --> 17:11.725
Slow-- Slow down
when you get towards the hill.

17:11.828 --> 17:13.278
Yeah-- Okay.
Stop, stop, stop.

17:13.382 --> 17:15.901
Left pedal.
Hit the brake. Okay.

17:16.005 --> 17:17.558
Let's try again.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.698
I don't feel safe.

17:19.802 --> 17:20.975
That's not helping.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.287
Okay, there's two pedals.

17:22.391 --> 17:24.013
All right, left pedal
is the brake,

17:24.117 --> 17:25.187
right pedal is the gas.

17:25.290 --> 17:26.947
You use your right foot
for both.

17:27.051 --> 17:31.641
So take your right foot off
the brake and put it on the gas.

17:31.745 --> 17:33.850
Just press down very gently.

17:33.954 --> 17:35.749
Good. Little more.

17:35.852 --> 17:37.095
Little more gas. You got it.

17:37.199 --> 17:38.786
A little more gas.
Press down evenly.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.375
Press a little more.
Give it more, more, more.

17:41.479 --> 17:43.826
Good. Good.
- You know, I take it back.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.724
I feel safe.
- Please-- Oh, my--

17:45.828 --> 17:47.071
Please.
- Don't-- Don't--

17:47.174 --> 17:48.313
Just don't listen to him,
pay attention

17:48.417 --> 17:50.108
to what you're doing.

17:50.764 --> 17:53.629
Let's turn around up there
by that hill.

17:53.732 --> 17:55.562
Okay.

17:55.665 --> 17:57.667
A little more gas.

17:57.771 --> 17:59.462
You got it.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.572
Okay. Okay.
A little less gas.

18:05.675 --> 18:06.952
Up here, coming up on
the hill,

18:07.056 --> 18:08.678
A little less gas on the hill.

18:08.782 --> 18:10.784
Take your foot off
the gas a little bit.

18:10.887 --> 18:13.200
Okay, good. Okay. All right.

18:13.304 --> 18:15.202
You all right?

18:16.824 --> 18:18.171
One more time.

18:18.274 --> 18:20.000
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's go.

18:20.104 --> 18:21.450
A little more--
Okay, you're rolling back.

18:21.553 --> 18:23.728
Hit the gas.
Hit the gas.

18:28.284 --> 18:30.079
- I'm heading out.
- Yeah, uh,

18:30.183 --> 18:32.909
Thomas, I need you
to go down to the river

18:33.013 --> 18:34.635
with your brother and salvage.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.292
What? But you said
that if I--

18:36.396 --> 18:38.018
Right, right, right,
but the window covers

18:38.122 --> 18:40.676
need to be reinforced, so.

18:40.779 --> 18:43.403
You can go to
the Rose farm tomorrow.

18:51.169 --> 18:53.999
Love it.

18:54.103 --> 18:56.657
I'll have your dinner
waiting.

19:06.288 --> 19:08.048
It's your fault I'm here,
you know?

19:08.152 --> 19:11.327
My fault, how?
How do you figure that?

19:11.431 --> 19:13.398
Well, if you hadn't nearly
crashed this thing,

19:13.502 --> 19:15.504
Dad would let you
go on your own.

19:15.607 --> 19:18.092
And I wouldn't be stuck
taking care of you.

19:18.196 --> 19:20.647
So you're taking care of me?

19:22.476 --> 19:23.960
- That's right.
- You know, you--

19:24.064 --> 19:25.479
you can go wherever you want.

19:25.583 --> 19:27.481
I don't need your help.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.419
You know what, stop right here.

19:34.523 --> 19:37.250
You're right.
You don't need me.

19:40.356 --> 19:41.875
Hey, I'll meet you right here
before the sun sets

19:41.978 --> 19:44.843
behind that hill that way
we can go back together.

20:25.953 --> 20:27.783
Back for more, huh?

20:27.886 --> 20:29.819
I still got
some more work to do.

20:29.923 --> 20:32.615
All right. Love to hear it.
Let's go.

20:34.272 --> 20:36.861
Come on.
- My legs are tired.

20:36.964 --> 20:38.483
Ran all the way here.

20:48.976 --> 20:50.288
Hi, Thomas.

20:50.392 --> 20:52.463
We were wondering if we
were gonna see you today.

20:52.566 --> 20:54.258
I had some work to do with
my father and brother

20:54.361 --> 20:56.052
this morning, but--
but I wanted to come back

20:56.156 --> 20:57.951
and finish up from yesterday.

20:58.054 --> 20:59.573
Well, we appreciate it.

20:59.677 --> 21:02.645
At least have a drink of water
before you start up again.

21:08.996 --> 21:10.653
It's broken.

21:11.758 --> 21:13.760
You scared me.

21:13.863 --> 21:15.451
Boo.

21:20.111 --> 21:22.493
So what are you doing here?

21:24.149 --> 21:27.532
Uh, well, I didn't finish
fixing the lambing stalls

21:27.636 --> 21:29.051
from yesterday.
- It's fixed.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.364
Pops did it.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.677
Oh, okay.

21:37.439 --> 21:39.613
It was good to see you.

21:42.306 --> 21:44.894
Yeah.
It's good to see you, too.

21:59.288 --> 22:01.186
My dad wants your help
with something else, though.

22:01.290 --> 22:03.568
- What?
- My dad wants your help

22:03.672 --> 22:05.915
with something else.

22:06.019 --> 22:07.710
Follow me.

22:09.678 --> 22:11.473
Okay.

24:27.816 --> 24:29.093
Oh, sh--

24:44.695 --> 24:47.870
Didn't you say your dad
needed my help?

24:49.113 --> 24:51.080
With what?

24:52.323 --> 24:55.084
- I'm confused.

24:55.188 --> 24:57.190
When I was little,
this was the furthest

24:57.293 --> 24:59.986
my parents would let me go.

25:00.089 --> 25:04.404
They said as long as I was
touching the tree, I'd be okay.

25:04.508 --> 25:08.753
No, think about it. You got
so much space to walk around.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.411
- I mean, I was eight, so.
- Look at this!

25:11.515 --> 25:13.965
This is really smart
for an eight year old.

25:14.069 --> 25:17.348
Really smart
for an eight year old.

25:17.451 --> 25:19.350
I wish I had come up with this.

25:19.937 --> 25:23.181
Do you want to play
crappy apocalypse?

25:25.770 --> 25:27.116
- What's that?

25:27.220 --> 25:29.671
So you have to explain
what happened

25:29.774 --> 25:33.226
at the end of the world
in 10 seconds.

25:33.329 --> 25:34.468
- 10 seconds?
- Uh-huh.

25:34.572 --> 25:36.160
For the entire
end of the world?

25:36.263 --> 25:37.817
Yeah.

25:38.438 --> 25:39.784
You go first.

25:39.888 --> 25:41.372
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

25:41.475 --> 25:43.408
- I'm really good at it, so.
- Okay.

25:43.512 --> 25:45.341
Okay.
- Yeah.

25:45.445 --> 25:47.447
Let's see. Ready?

25:47.551 --> 25:49.138
Yeah, count me in.

25:49.242 --> 25:50.381
Three.

25:50.484 --> 25:52.556
Two. One.

25:52.659 --> 25:54.350
- So there was this bug...
- 10, 9...

25:54.454 --> 25:55.524
...and it got this infection

25:55.628 --> 25:57.422
and it bit tons of people

25:57.526 --> 25:59.390
and they all got
the infection too.

25:59.493 --> 26:01.185
- 5...
- And then they died

26:01.288 --> 26:02.773
and the machines took over

26:02.876 --> 26:04.602
and they took advantage...
- 2...

26:04.706 --> 26:06.052
...and the only people
that were left...

26:06.155 --> 26:07.605
- ...1.
- ...were us.

26:07.709 --> 26:08.882
That's pretty good.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.366
You were ready.
You had that ready to go.

26:10.470 --> 26:12.196
No, I didn't.

26:12.299 --> 26:14.163
Okay. Your turn.

26:14.267 --> 26:15.302
Okay.

26:15.406 --> 26:16.510
- Ready?
- I need to warm up.

26:16.614 --> 26:17.615
- I need to warm up.
- 3...

26:17.719 --> 26:18.892
- Hold on, hold on.
- 2...

26:18.996 --> 26:20.342
- Hold on, hold on.
- 1, tag.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.550
Once upon a time,
all the humans

26:21.654 --> 26:23.587
were living happy
in their houses.

26:23.690 --> 26:26.417
And in the distance,
this purple haze shows up.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.384
And it covers the entire sky.

26:28.488 --> 26:29.765
They all breathe it in...
- 2...

26:29.869 --> 26:31.387
...and they turn into wolves
and run...

26:31.491 --> 26:32.630
- 1...
- ...into the forest and we

26:32.734 --> 26:34.149
haven't seen them since.
- You're done.

26:34.252 --> 26:35.599
I still have a little bit
more to go.

26:35.702 --> 26:37.980
For all you know,
it could be real.

26:38.084 --> 26:39.603
- It could be.
- You could have

26:39.706 --> 26:41.432
a long lost wolf brother.
- Maybe you cracked it.

26:41.535 --> 26:43.917
Maybe that's what happened.
- Yeah.

26:49.820 --> 26:52.305
It's getting late.
I should go.

26:52.408 --> 26:53.789
Okay.

26:53.893 --> 26:56.102
- I'll come back soon, though.
- When?

26:56.205 --> 26:57.275
Tomorrow.

26:57.379 --> 26:59.208
I-If that's okay with you.

26:59.312 --> 27:01.866
Yeah, that's fine with me.

27:05.974 --> 27:07.769
Okay.

27:15.673 --> 27:20.885
Uh, do you have 10
more seconds to spare?

27:21.679 --> 27:24.130
- 10 seconds?
- Uh-huh.

27:25.614 --> 27:27.202
Yeah, sure.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.624
One...

27:35.728 --> 27:38.385
Two...

27:38.489 --> 27:40.249
Three...

27:40.353 --> 27:42.113
Four...

27:42.217 --> 27:44.115
Five...

27:44.219 --> 27:45.703
Six...
- Six...

27:45.807 --> 27:47.429
- Seven...
- Seven...

27:47.532 --> 27:49.155
- Eight...
- Eight...

27:49.258 --> 27:51.295
- Nine...
- Nine...

27:51.398 --> 27:52.883
10.

27:52.986 --> 27:54.056
10.

28:20.013 --> 28:21.290
Ah.

28:57.844 --> 28:59.812
Rocco.

29:08.579 --> 29:10.167
Thomas.

29:12.617 --> 29:14.205
Joseph.

29:44.580 --> 29:46.272
Okay.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.274
Whew!

29:52.519 --> 29:54.280
Ah!

30:36.701 --> 30:37.875
Where's your brother?

30:37.979 --> 30:39.083
- He's not here?
- No. Where is he?

30:39.187 --> 30:41.016
I don't know,
he, um--

30:41.120 --> 30:42.707
He said he was gonna
go to the Rose farm

30:42.811 --> 30:44.640
and said he'd meet him
before sunset.

30:44.744 --> 30:46.884
He wasn't there.

30:54.236 --> 30:57.032
You'll lock down the house
on your own tonight.

30:57.136 --> 30:59.000
I'll be back with your brother
in the morning.

30:59.103 --> 31:00.656
- No, I'll come with you.
- I need you

31:00.760 --> 31:02.382
to secure the house.

31:02.486 --> 31:03.728
You know what to do.

31:03.832 --> 31:05.420
I'm sorry, Dad.

31:05.523 --> 31:07.387
This isn't your fault.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.320
This is my fault.

31:13.186 --> 31:15.464
Keep watch this lock.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.107
It's okay.

31:48.808 --> 31:50.292
Rocco.

32:06.239 --> 32:07.413
Uh.

32:10.795 --> 32:12.383
Ah.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.473
Oh. Ah.

35:16.015 --> 35:18.742
Thomas, are you down there?

35:18.845 --> 35:19.881
Dad?

35:19.984 --> 35:21.883
How'd you get down there?

35:21.986 --> 35:24.023
I-I-I fell.

35:24.127 --> 35:26.405
I'll find a way in.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.661
Here.

36:00.991 --> 36:02.544
Are you hurt?

36:02.648 --> 36:04.374
I slipped when I was running,

36:04.477 --> 36:06.445
I hit my head, um...

36:08.343 --> 36:10.449
You probably have a concussion.

36:10.552 --> 36:13.521
Looks like we'll be staying
right here until dawn.

36:13.624 --> 36:16.834
All right, let's try
and close up this entrance.

39:00.688 --> 39:03.725
- Oh, I got you.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.202
What-- What are they doing?

39:32.305 --> 39:33.962
Dad. Dad.

39:44.145 --> 39:45.871
When I say go,

39:45.974 --> 39:47.838
pull that rock.

40:00.955 --> 40:02.094
Go.

40:22.701 --> 40:24.323
What's going on?

40:28.707 --> 40:30.950
They're coming out
from underneath us!

40:33.746 --> 40:35.023
We gotta get out of here.

40:45.758 --> 40:48.727
Dad.
Dad, they trapped us in.

40:51.108 --> 40:52.455
Dad?

40:54.767 --> 40:56.769
Get back against the wall!

40:58.633 --> 41:00.117
What are you doing?!

41:00.221 --> 41:02.534
Stay back! Go back! Go back!

42:30.069 --> 42:31.692
What happened?

42:31.795 --> 42:33.452
I slipped on a rock
when I was running home

42:33.556 --> 42:35.661
and I fell into a cave!

42:35.765 --> 42:38.561
I got out and hid,
but those things found me.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.875
How'd he get like this?

42:42.979 --> 42:45.533
He blew up his arm
in the middle of--

42:45.637 --> 42:48.432
in the middle of 'em.
- Okay.

42:48.536 --> 42:50.573
And he's been unconscious since?

42:50.676 --> 42:52.126
Yeah.

42:53.817 --> 42:58.304
Hold his head up for me.
Put his arms up. Careful.

42:58.408 --> 43:00.859
- Ready?
- Yep. Give me one sec.

43:00.962 --> 43:02.930
- Good?
- Yeah, I got him.

43:03.033 --> 43:04.483
Ready?

43:20.637 --> 43:22.535
Why don't you focus on driving?

43:30.302 --> 43:33.374
Watch...

43:33.477 --> 43:35.963
- Sorry.
- Okay.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.661
Okay.

43:47.733 --> 43:50.149
Do you, um--
Do you think he'll be okay

43:50.253 --> 43:51.944
if he gets some rest?

43:58.261 --> 44:00.573
I just...

44:00.677 --> 44:03.300
What should we do?

44:03.404 --> 44:04.923
I don't know.

44:49.346 --> 44:51.038
Don't touch that.

44:52.418 --> 44:54.041
What is it?

44:55.559 --> 44:59.598
I caught one of them
last night.

44:59.702 --> 45:02.290
You're not serious.

45:02.394 --> 45:04.810
How?

45:04.914 --> 45:08.745
Set a trap
using myself as bait.

45:08.849 --> 45:12.197
You're crazy.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.716
It worked.

45:17.823 --> 45:20.412
Thomas, don't.

45:22.517 --> 45:23.795
Stop. The light hurts it.

45:23.898 --> 45:25.486
What is it? Your pet.

45:45.333 --> 45:48.026
It was eight minutes
last night.

45:48.129 --> 45:50.787
That's the least amount of time
they've ever spent

45:50.891 --> 45:53.100
trying to get in.

45:53.203 --> 45:54.998
And there were only two of them.

45:55.102 --> 45:58.933
We captured one.
We have one in here.

45:59.037 --> 46:02.281
I don't know.
Something's not right.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.145
Maybe they're scared.

46:04.249 --> 46:05.353
They're smart.

46:05.457 --> 46:07.459
Dad and I killed a bunch
of them last night,

46:07.562 --> 46:08.874
and Mr. and Mrs. Rose

46:08.978 --> 46:11.325
said they hardly ever go
to the Rose farm.

46:11.428 --> 46:13.672
You killed them, not Dad?

46:13.776 --> 46:18.642
Yeah. I did.
I killed a bunch of them.

46:18.746 --> 46:20.161
Okay.

46:23.199 --> 46:25.477
I could kill the one in there
right now.

46:34.624 --> 46:37.351
- You ready?
- Go ahead.

46:41.527 --> 46:44.979
No. Are you crazy?
I'm not opening that.

46:45.083 --> 46:46.947
- Come on. Do it.
- No.

46:47.050 --> 46:49.018
- Just-- Just do it.
- No! No!

46:49.121 --> 46:51.814
- Just do it!
- No!

47:03.411 --> 47:04.516
Just a sec. Shh.

47:04.619 --> 47:07.070
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

47:21.498 --> 47:23.017
Rocco! No! Rocco! No!

47:31.612 --> 47:33.062
I got it.

47:51.597 --> 47:54.014
Hey. You alright?

47:57.672 --> 48:02.056
I was gonna study.
I was gonna learn from it.

48:04.783 --> 48:06.474
Think we can eat it?

48:20.764 --> 48:23.560
No. Get down. Down. Down.

49:22.205 --> 49:24.828
We need to take Dad
to the Rose farm.

49:24.932 --> 49:27.038
They have better medicine,
better care.

49:27.141 --> 49:31.559
It's a waste of time.
They're not gonna help us.

49:31.663 --> 49:33.630
Well, how do you know that?

49:33.734 --> 49:35.529
Because <i>I</i> wouldn't help us.

49:43.226 --> 49:47.368
We're taking Dad
to the Rose farm. Now.

49:56.343 --> 49:58.379
Scooch him in more.

50:02.107 --> 50:04.385
- Push him towards you.
- Okay.

50:04.489 --> 50:07.285
Ah. Okay.

50:41.940 --> 50:43.700
Stop.

50:53.193 --> 50:55.471
- What happened?
- I got caught out after dark,

50:55.574 --> 50:57.369
and my dad had to come get me.

50:57.473 --> 51:00.786
I slipped and fell
when I was running home.

51:00.890 --> 51:02.443
We need help.

51:02.547 --> 51:04.273
If you have any medicine
or if--

51:04.376 --> 51:07.241
If we could just stay here.
At least until he gets better?

51:11.349 --> 51:13.075
I'm sorry, boys.

51:13.178 --> 51:16.630
We don't have any medicine
to spare, and--

51:16.733 --> 51:19.495
We can't take in anyone
injured so badly.

51:19.598 --> 51:23.499
Your father's strong.
He'll pull through.

51:23.602 --> 51:26.502
- We have room.
- Charlotte.

51:36.926 --> 51:38.583
Thomas can stay.

51:41.551 --> 51:45.279
That'll leave more supplies back
at your farm for your father.

52:03.297 --> 52:06.024
Where are you going?

52:06.128 --> 52:08.751
You can stay.
That's what you want, yeah?

52:08.854 --> 52:10.477
- No.
- Of course it is.

52:10.580 --> 52:14.101
I mean, look at this place.
Who wouldn't want to stay here?

52:14.205 --> 52:17.208
What do you want from me?

52:17.311 --> 52:19.589
I don't want anything from you.

52:22.730 --> 52:25.940
You don't take responsibility,
and you do what you want

52:26.044 --> 52:27.356
and you don't care what happens.

52:27.459 --> 52:30.255
- That's not true.
- Of course it is!

52:30.359 --> 52:31.808
Dad would never say it.

52:31.912 --> 52:35.053
But look at him!

52:35.157 --> 52:36.917
He's gonna die!

52:37.020 --> 52:38.332
Shut up!

52:39.299 --> 52:40.955
That's not--
- Thomas!

53:04.772 --> 53:06.981
No.

53:47.159 --> 53:49.610
You're okay, son.

53:49.714 --> 53:51.440
Here.

53:52.717 --> 53:55.029
I'm sorry
it has to be this way.

53:58.792 --> 54:01.346
I understand.

54:01.450 --> 54:04.349
Charlotte,
show Thomas to his quarters.

54:04.453 --> 54:06.903
Give him something to eat.

54:12.357 --> 54:15.498
I'm not sure how
I feel about that.

54:15.602 --> 54:17.500
It's the best thing
for everyone.

54:17.604 --> 54:19.226
Nothing's the best thing
for everyone.

54:19.330 --> 54:21.608
Someone always suffers.

54:40.558 --> 54:43.077
I think you should eat.

54:43.181 --> 54:45.563
You need to keep
your strength up.

55:56.634 --> 55:59.671
It's a rocking horse.
It's a toy.

56:02.398 --> 56:05.056
Glad you told me
because, um...

56:05.919 --> 56:08.853
...where I come from, all we
have are stones and sticks

56:08.956 --> 56:11.027
and bugs to play with.

56:11.131 --> 56:15.377
Okay. I'm sorry if I act like
you don't know things.

56:15.480 --> 56:16.481
It's a...

56:16.585 --> 56:19.277
Nervous habit.

56:19.381 --> 56:22.004
Why would I be nervous?

56:24.109 --> 56:26.008
I don't know.

56:27.803 --> 56:30.322
You're the one
that seems nervous.

56:32.394 --> 56:37.157
It's, um, a trick
that Joseph taught me.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.779
Read it in a book.

56:45.407 --> 56:47.719
Are you sure
you're not nervous?

56:51.171 --> 56:54.277
Yeah. Yeah. It's just, um...

57:01.733 --> 57:05.427
Being with you is the only thing
that makes me happy.

57:24.929 --> 57:27.034
Charlotte, did you manage--

57:29.312 --> 57:30.728
Ohh.

57:32.419 --> 57:33.524
Okay.

57:33.627 --> 57:35.008
I-I was just showing--

57:35.111 --> 57:36.596
Yes.

57:36.699 --> 57:39.150
I know what <i>you</i> were doing.

57:39.253 --> 57:40.876
Get over here right now.

57:40.979 --> 57:43.913
- Dad.
- I will not ask you again.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.976
What's going on?

01:00:42.126 --> 01:00:43.990
I can't stay.

01:00:45.577 --> 01:00:48.788
Well, you can't go now.
It's too late.

01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:51.100
My-- My dad didn't mean it.

01:00:53.793 --> 01:00:55.449
Do you have medicine?

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.699
Charlotte, listen to me.

01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:06.219
My dad will die.

01:01:08.048 --> 01:01:10.016
Please.

01:01:43.601 --> 01:01:45.499
I'll come back.

01:02:06.797 --> 01:02:09.385
- Hold on a second there.

01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:16.427
Don't do it.

01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:24.469
You're stealing.

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:28.266
No. No.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:30.027
Then why you runnin'?

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:33.099
Cause I don't have much time.

01:02:33.202 --> 01:02:35.342
Look. I-I didn't steal, okay?

01:02:35.446 --> 01:02:38.380
I-- Charlotte gave it to me.
Y-You can ask her.

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:42.522
Okay.

01:02:43.799 --> 01:02:45.490
Come on.

01:02:47.665 --> 01:02:49.494
Please.

01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:58.400
Okay.

01:03:42.306 --> 01:03:44.377
See what they try
and replace me with?

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.759
A liar and a thief.

01:03:47.863 --> 01:03:52.281
You know we used to have
things called laws?

01:03:52.385 --> 01:03:55.008
You know?
This was before your time.

01:03:55.112 --> 01:03:58.425
And if you broke the law,
you'd be punished.

01:03:58.529 --> 01:04:01.187
Just like how I'm gonna
punish you right now.

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.809
Grab his legs...

01:04:02.913 --> 01:04:05.191
I'm telling you!
I didn't steal!

01:04:05.294 --> 01:04:07.676
You're not gonna be
so fast now.

01:04:07.779 --> 01:04:10.679
- No!
- Take a nice deep breath.

01:04:10.782 --> 01:04:12.508
- No! No!
- That's it.

01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:14.441
No! Please! No!

01:04:14.545 --> 01:04:17.306
- Don't sweat it, kid.
- God, please! Please, God!

01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:21.172
- It's just life.
- Please! Charlotte!

01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:26.798
Hobs!

01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:33.219
Hobs!

01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:54.516
What is it?

01:04:59.003 --> 01:05:01.178
I'm not sure.

01:05:08.668 --> 01:05:10.428
I'd better go and take a look.

01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:14.432
No!

01:05:28.377 --> 01:05:30.172
Charlotte!

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.106
Charlotte!

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.954
No!

01:06:52.496 --> 01:06:55.740
Please let me up.
Please untie me. Please!

01:07:05.302 --> 01:07:07.752
Wait! Untie me!

01:07:16.175 --> 01:07:17.762
- No!

01:07:35.125 --> 01:07:36.816
Come on.

01:07:39.991 --> 01:07:41.476
Hang on.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:54.109
No. No. They're gone.

01:07:54.213 --> 01:07:56.284
They're gone.

01:07:57.630 --> 01:07:59.356
We need to go now.

01:09:47.878 --> 01:09:49.293
Tom?

01:09:49.397 --> 01:09:52.123
Joseph. Joseph. It's me.

01:09:52.227 --> 01:09:55.057
Get on that side.

01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:57.577
How the hell
did you get up here?

01:09:59.786 --> 01:10:01.961
- Good?
- Yeah.

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:10.211
What happened?

01:10:10.314 --> 01:10:11.695
We ran here.

01:10:11.798 --> 01:10:13.869
Are you okay?

01:10:13.973 --> 01:10:16.803
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

01:10:16.907 --> 01:10:18.529
Okay.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:42.243
Hey. Um...

01:10:42.346 --> 01:10:44.797
I, uh...

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.524
...brought these for Dad.

01:10:51.424 --> 01:10:54.013
Did, uh, anyone else make it?

01:11:03.954 --> 01:11:05.335
Joseph...

01:11:07.854 --> 01:11:10.926
What I did, um...

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:13.308
I, uh...

01:11:16.035 --> 01:11:17.933
I can't, um...

01:11:19.487 --> 01:11:21.661
I can't do this alone.

01:11:24.043 --> 01:11:25.700
I can't.

01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:33.949
Dad? Dad!

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:44.788
Dad, they've, um...

01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:49.724
They've dug under the house.

01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:52.761
They're gonna come up
through the floors.

01:11:55.005 --> 01:11:56.765
What do we do?

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.710
Fight.

01:12:20.133 --> 01:12:21.963
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

01:12:31.317 --> 01:12:32.663
Joseph.

01:12:40.568 --> 01:12:42.052
Were they in here?

01:12:42.155 --> 01:12:44.503
Uh, no. This was me.

01:12:44.606 --> 01:12:47.160
Get that wheelbarrow
from the back there.

01:12:51.337 --> 01:12:53.857
Hey. Take this, please.
- Okay.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.251
Rocco. Come here.

01:13:12.393 --> 01:13:14.084
Come here, boy.

01:13:14.187 --> 01:13:16.500
Stay here, okay? Be good.

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:18.191
Stay. It's too dangerous.

01:13:18.295 --> 01:13:21.091
Okay? Be good, okay?

01:13:21.194 --> 01:13:22.851
Stay, stay, stay.

01:13:22.955 --> 01:13:24.508
Stay here.

01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:27.235
Uh, okay. We need to
move this inside.

01:13:27.338 --> 01:13:28.719
Why?

01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:32.171
You need to trust me. Okay?
Now. Please. Please.

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:35.312
Yeah. Okay. Ready?

01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:36.934
Got it? Up!

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.215
Okay. Okay.

01:13:54.642 --> 01:13:57.334
Uh, I need more time.

01:13:57.438 --> 01:14:00.337
How much time do you need?
We can help.

01:14:00.441 --> 01:14:03.754
Uh, I need 10 minutes.

01:14:05.998 --> 01:14:07.724
Yeah. Okay.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:35.372
Alright.

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:09.061
What is it?

01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:37.192
Okay.

01:17:05.349 --> 01:17:06.868
Move!

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:12.736
He'll break in any second!

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.496
That's fine.
We want them in the house.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.395
- Why?
- He has a plan.

01:17:22.539 --> 01:17:23.816
Alright, Tom, help me.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.611
Is it a good plan?

01:17:31.306 --> 01:17:32.860
Dad?

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.346
Put it down.

01:17:56.642 --> 01:17:58.609
Dad, I set a trap.
There's no time.

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:10.474
Go! Dad! Hey.

01:19:16.066 --> 01:19:17.481
Dad?

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.725
Dad!

01:19:19.829 --> 01:19:21.347
Dad?!

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.115
- Dad!
- Joseph, we gotta go.

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:35.672
Joe. We gotta go.

01:19:54.518 --> 01:19:57.521
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:06.461 --> 01:20:08.670
Now! We have to go!

01:20:08.774 --> 01:20:11.294
Okay.

01:20:14.538 --> 01:20:15.746
Pull it.

01:20:26.757 --> 01:20:28.690
Unh! Hold on! No!

01:20:28.794 --> 01:20:30.831
No!

01:20:34.904 --> 01:20:36.457
No!

01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:01.275
Dad! Dad!

01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:02.793
Dad!

01:21:02.897 --> 01:21:05.555
Tom, just-- Tom, over here.

01:21:24.056 --> 01:21:27.025
Get back, Joe!
Get to the truck!

01:21:30.856 --> 01:21:32.616
Right. Right.

01:21:38.105 --> 01:21:39.382
How do I start it?!

01:21:39.485 --> 01:21:42.005
You turn the key
when I tell you.

01:21:43.662 --> 01:21:45.043
Wait, wait, wait. Go.

01:21:45.146 --> 01:21:46.458
- Now?
- Yes!

01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:48.978
Turn it, turn it, turn it.

01:22:11.207 --> 01:22:12.725
We've got one left.

01:22:53.525 --> 01:22:54.905
Are you okay?

01:23:00.808 --> 01:23:02.361
Look at that.

01:23:29.768 --> 01:23:31.528
We'll rebuild it.

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:37.017
I don't want to rebuild it.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.364
I want to build something now.

01:24:02.076 --> 01:24:04.044
You taught me so much.

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:08.600
Everything I know.

01:24:11.534 --> 01:24:14.778
He gave his life
in a world of death.

01:24:17.057 --> 01:24:19.542
Love in a world of violence.

01:24:25.858 --> 01:24:29.241
A future in a world without one.

01:24:29.345 --> 01:24:32.693
We'll carry you with us
wherever we go.

01:24:37.767 --> 01:24:39.079
Always.

01:25:40.416 --> 01:25:43.039
You, uh--
You handled it pretty well.

01:25:46.974 --> 01:25:48.700
Thanks.

01:25:51.806 --> 01:25:54.430
So... where are we going?

01:25:56.121 --> 01:25:59.020
Well, there's six farms
in the valley.

01:25:59.124 --> 01:26:02.162
That's 23 people, including us.

01:26:02.265 --> 01:26:04.716
What if they got to them?

01:26:04.819 --> 01:26:07.408
Let's just hope someone
made it through the night.

01:26:07.512 --> 01:26:09.238
We did.

01:26:09.341 --> 01:26:12.620
"We."
- Yeah, "we."

01:26:14.553 --> 01:26:17.349
I shot, like, a hundred
of those things.

01:26:17.453 --> 01:26:19.869
You just blew up your house.

01:26:19.972 --> 01:26:22.216
Anyone can blow up their house.

01:26:29.327 --> 01:26:31.294
She's cool.

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:52.073
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:52.177 --> 01:26:53.972
