01:14.614 --> 01:16.878
Q-U...

01:17.049 --> 01:19.040
...A-R...

01:21.721 --> 01:23.951
...A-N-T...

01:26.092 --> 01:28.652
...I-N-E.

01:32.131 --> 01:34.497
Quarantine.

01:35.134 --> 01:38.160
Q-U-A-R...

01:41.240 --> 01:43.708
...A-N-T...

01:44.443 --> 01:46.934
...I-N-E.

01:47.513 --> 01:49.105
Quarantine.

01:49.315 --> 01:50.873
You know the cholera?

01:51.050 --> 01:52.574
Yes, Mother.

01:52.752 --> 01:55.687
You've seen the signs on
the houses where the coloreds live?

01:55.855 --> 01:57.516
Yes, Mother.

01:57.690 --> 01:58.952
You know the typhus?

01:59.125 --> 02:01.184
I do, Mother.

02:04.096 --> 02:06.121
You know what they
can do to you?

02:06.966 --> 02:08.524
Yes, Mother.

02:12.471 --> 02:14.837
You are not safe.

02:21.847 --> 02:25.442
You may be directing this movie,
but what you're asking, we can't do.

02:26.786 --> 02:28.481
Don't tell me it can't be done.

02:28.654 --> 02:32.420
The gyro forces are too much.
You send these planes into barrel rolls...

02:32.591 --> 02:36.083
...they won't make it.
- It's the climax of the picture. Make it work.

02:36.262 --> 02:38.753
Decrease the vertical trajectory
if you have to.

02:38.931 --> 02:41.422
A Le Rhône rotary
won't stall at 60 degrees.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.161
We're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down...

02:45.337 --> 02:48.738
We're not cutting. I'll get those cameras.
Set up for rehearsals.

02:48.908 --> 02:51.706
I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I'd find you here.

02:51.877 --> 02:53.970
Dietrich.
You're a man on the come.

02:54.146 --> 02:57.980
I read your résumé, talked to your references.
Know what I'm looking for?

02:58.150 --> 03:01.176
You're looking for a second-in-command
at Hughes Tools.

03:01.353 --> 03:04.117
Someone to oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.054
I'm looking for somebody to run it
and do a good job.

03:07.226 --> 03:09.490
There's only one thing
you've gotta know.

03:09.662 --> 03:12.495
My folks, they're gone now.
So it's my money.

03:12.665 --> 03:16.396
What I do with that money may seem crazy
to those sons of bitches in Houston.

03:16.569 --> 03:20.130
I'm sure it does, but it all makes
good sense to me. You got that?

03:20.306 --> 03:22.103
- Got it.
- Good.

03:22.274 --> 03:25.402
Now, you made, what,
$5200 a year at your last job?

03:25.578 --> 03:29.446
- I'll pay you $10,000.
- I guess I'll be working twice as hard.

03:29.615 --> 03:33.176
You'll be working four times as hard.
I just got you at half price.

03:33.352 --> 03:34.842
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

03:35.020 --> 03:37.181
You're my voice now.
Make them understand that.

03:37.356 --> 03:41.520
Some of those folks still call me Junior.
You tell them it's "Mr. Hughes" now.

03:41.694 --> 03:43.787
You bet.
So when do we go to Houston?

03:43.963 --> 03:47.228
We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.
Two thousand dead.

03:47.399 --> 03:49.458
Whole place is nothing but
pestilential swamp.

03:49.635 --> 03:53.731
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever.
You name it, they got it.

03:53.906 --> 03:55.373
You see that, Mr. Dietrich?

03:56.375 --> 04:00.436
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

04:00.613 --> 04:02.638
What do you think of that, now?

04:04.049 --> 04:05.607
It's your money.

04:05.785 --> 04:08.185
Start them up!

05:34.139 --> 05:37.973
I saw the rough cut of the new
Tod Browning movie, <i>London After Midnight.</i>

05:38.143 --> 05:39.940
Lon Chaney is incredible.

05:40.112 --> 05:42.444
It's his best performance
in a long time.

05:42.615 --> 05:44.947
It's gonna be a big hit.
The cards are great.

05:45.117 --> 05:46.550
It's supposed to be...

05:46.719 --> 05:49.153
Hello, Mr. Mayer.

05:49.321 --> 05:52.313
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

05:52.491 --> 05:54.857
I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

05:55.027 --> 05:58.087
- Oh, Howard Hughes. The airplane picture?
- Exactly.

05:58.264 --> 06:00.596
- I remember.
<i>- Hell's Angels.</i> You heard of it.

06:00.766 --> 06:01.994
- Good.
- Yes.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.965
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

06:05.137 --> 06:06.434
I need a few cameras.

06:07.273 --> 06:10.265
- Yeah?
- Yeah, two, to be exact.

06:11.176 --> 06:15.203
I bought every camera I could find.
We're shooting our big dogfight sequence.

06:15.381 --> 06:18.817
I need two more. Desperately.
You think MGM could help me out?

06:19.118 --> 06:20.346
With what?

06:20.519 --> 06:23.317
- Cameras.
- Oh, with the actual cam...

06:23.489 --> 06:26.686
We're not usually in the practice
of helping out competition.

06:26.959 --> 06:29.985
- No. No.
- So how many cameras do you have now?

06:30.162 --> 06:31.527
Twenty-four.

06:34.099 --> 06:36.693
You?
Wait a minute.

06:38.971 --> 06:40.836
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

06:41.006 --> 06:43.600
- And you need..? You need two more?
- Yeah.

06:43.776 --> 06:47.371
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

06:47.546 --> 06:50.174
You know, I think...
I think we've got them all...

06:50.349 --> 06:52.783
Don't we have them?
They're all used, right?

06:52.952 --> 06:55.216
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

06:55.387 --> 06:57.252
- Jesus Christ, sonny.
- Howard.

06:57.423 --> 07:00.085
Howard. Let me give you
a little advice, huh?

07:00.259 --> 07:02.352
- Take your oil money...
- Drill bits.

07:02.528 --> 07:05.622
All right, take your drill-bit money
and put it in the bank.

07:05.798 --> 07:08.460
If you continue making
the movie the way you are...

07:08.634 --> 07:10.898
...there isn't gonna be a distributor...

07:11.070 --> 07:14.039
...you won't find anybody
who wants to see the movie...

07:14.206 --> 07:16.868
...and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

07:17.042 --> 07:20.068
So welcome to Hollywood.

07:20.245 --> 07:23.646
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr. Mayer.

07:23.816 --> 07:25.613
- Good luck.
- All right.

07:25.784 --> 07:28.981
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

07:36.228 --> 07:39.061
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

07:40.899 --> 07:43.629
Boss.
Scram, love boat, let's go.

07:44.870 --> 07:47.896
- Another soda. You know what I mean.
- Milk. In the bottle.

07:48.073 --> 07:51.042
- With the cap still on.
- Okay, what did His Highness say?

07:51.210 --> 07:54.407
Son of a bitch won't part with
a single goddamn camera.

07:54.580 --> 07:57.105
Why don't you try and
make do with what you have.

07:57.683 --> 08:00.447
What I have isn't enough, John,
not for how I see it.

08:00.619 --> 08:02.109
Look.

08:02.287 --> 08:06.223
My name depends on this picture.
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston...

08:06.392 --> 08:09.190
...making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

08:09.361 --> 08:11.522
Can't you do it
with the cameras you have?

08:11.697 --> 08:14.461
You ought to hear about
what's going on with DeMille.

08:14.633 --> 08:18.899
He's shooting his Bible picture.
He's gotta do a crucifixion in Fresno.

08:19.071 --> 08:20.299
Johnny.

08:20.472 --> 08:22.565
- A bunch of tractors...
- Johnny.

08:22.741 --> 08:24.902
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

08:25.077 --> 08:27.204
You're supposed to know
the ins and outs?

08:27.379 --> 08:28.607
- Absolutely.
- Do you?

08:28.781 --> 08:30.009
Yeah, absolutely.

08:30.182 --> 08:32.241
Then you leave the big ideas...

08:32.885 --> 08:34.977
...to me.
- Oh, yeah. Of course, boss.

08:35.154 --> 08:36.917
Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

08:38.057 --> 08:40.217
I thought you were
at the Brown Derby...

08:40.392 --> 08:42.121
...with Trixie. No, Theresa.

08:42.294 --> 08:43.818
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Exactly.

08:43.996 --> 08:46.123
What happened to Margaret?
She lost her...

08:46.298 --> 08:47.822
Thank God that's settled.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.128
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

08:51.303 --> 08:55.296
Howard and I were discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

08:56.141 --> 08:59.941
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

09:02.781 --> 09:06.080
Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

09:06.251 --> 09:08.116
My God.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.915
Would you do me
a favor and just?

09:11.090 --> 09:13.752
Would you just smile
for me one time? Just once?

09:17.029 --> 09:19.657
Yeah. Yeah. You see,
you got a short upper lip.

09:20.032 --> 09:21.829
Makes for a much nicer smile.

09:27.005 --> 09:30.600
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

09:30.843 --> 09:34.438
I mean, say you're just standing
there, right? And I just touch you.

09:34.613 --> 09:36.604
Just... Just like this.

09:37.216 --> 09:38.581
With my fingertips.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.980
Do you..?
Do you like that?

09:42.087 --> 09:43.679
Do you?

09:48.694 --> 09:51.720
You see, I wanna learn
what pleases you.

09:52.931 --> 09:55.991
I wanna learn everything about you.

09:56.168 --> 09:58.193
Would you let me do that?

09:58.370 --> 10:00.565
Would you give me that job?

10:05.711 --> 10:07.679
I'm off in a half an hour.

10:09.381 --> 10:12.111
- Well, I'm in room...
- 217.

10:12.284 --> 10:14.218
217.

10:16.221 --> 10:18.086
See you there.

10:22.394 --> 10:24.919
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warners.

10:25.097 --> 10:26.962
I need two more cameras
by Saturday.

10:27.132 --> 10:29.896
Rent them if you can.
Steal them if you have to.

10:30.636 --> 10:32.729
Absotively, boss.

10:33.205 --> 10:34.433
Absotively.

10:36.108 --> 10:38.872
<i>Rumors coming from a lonely airstrip</i>
<i>out in Van Nuys.</i>

10:39.044 --> 10:42.343
<i>Sources whisper that young</i>
<i>Texas industrialist Howard Hughes...</i>

10:42.514 --> 10:44.914
<i>... won't stop pouring money</i>
<i>into his war epic.</i>

10:45.083 --> 10:46.482
<i>And do we mean epic!</i>

10:46.652 --> 10:49.485
<i>One hundred and thirty-seven pilots,</i>
<i>87 airplanes...</i>

10:49.655 --> 10:54.058
<i>... 35 cameramen, 2000 extras.</i>
<i>How long will it be before this picture...</i>

10:54.226 --> 10:56.456
<i>... ends up costing as</i>
<i>much as the real war?</i>

10:56.628 --> 10:58.858
Damn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

10:59.031 --> 11:02.626
This isn't what it was like up there.
They look like goddamn models!

11:11.009 --> 11:12.442
Son of a bitch.

11:13.745 --> 11:15.144
Howard?

11:17.716 --> 11:21.618
Without something standing
still behind the planes...

11:21.787 --> 11:24.347
...we've got no idea
of how fast we're moving.

11:24.523 --> 11:27.356
We got no sense of relative motion.

11:28.527 --> 11:31.189
Call UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

11:31.363 --> 11:33.456
You get him here in an hour, all right?

11:36.835 --> 11:39.633
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

11:39.805 --> 11:41.363
- Bad news, always.
- All right.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.737
We installed the 450 radial.
Struts won't take the vibration.

11:44.910 --> 11:48.710
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

11:48.947 --> 11:51.677
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

11:52.084 --> 11:55.679
Goddamn it, Odie. If the 450's too big,
we figure something else out.

11:55.854 --> 11:58.823
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

11:58.991 --> 12:00.788
If we drain the fuel tank...

12:00.959 --> 12:04.622
...she might make 180 miles per hour.
- I want minimum 200, all right?

12:04.796 --> 12:07.663
I want a date with Theda Bara.
That ain't gonna happen.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.733
Oh, don't be so sure.

12:10.102 --> 12:13.970
If the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we gotta get rid of the struts.

12:14.139 --> 12:16.198
No, then the top wing falls off.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.468
Then let it.

12:20.979 --> 12:22.446
What?

12:23.749 --> 12:25.774
Who says we need a top wing?

12:25.951 --> 12:28.010
I mean, who says we need anything?

12:30.188 --> 12:32.622
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right?

12:32.791 --> 12:35.988
They're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and struts.

12:36.161 --> 12:38.561
- A 550 Wasp engine.
- One-hundred-octane fuel.

12:38.730 --> 12:42.029
- That would give us a horsepower of what?
- Seven hundred.

12:43.568 --> 12:47.698
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we got the fastest plane ever built.

12:50.509 --> 12:52.033
You know, I've gotta say...

12:52.210 --> 12:55.907
...we've already spent over $200,000
rebuilding this plane.

12:57.349 --> 12:58.941
To hell with it.

13:00.085 --> 13:01.450
Tear it up, Odie.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.985
Go on.

13:06.658 --> 13:07.989
Well...

13:10.929 --> 13:14.626
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak...

13:16.101 --> 13:18.228
...that look like...

13:18.403 --> 13:20.200
Giant breasts full of milk.

13:20.372 --> 13:22.101
I want clouds, damn it.

13:22.474 --> 13:24.066
Yes, clouds...

13:24.242 --> 13:28.042
...that look like
giant breasts full of milk...

13:28.213 --> 13:31.740
...cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

13:31.917 --> 13:34.010
So you might have to...

13:35.320 --> 13:36.685
To wait.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.724
Then we'll wait.

13:41.693 --> 13:44.025
Look, whatever they pay
you at UCLA...

13:44.196 --> 13:47.791
...I'm doubling it, all right?
You work for me now. Find some clouds.

13:49.267 --> 13:50.632
Find some clouds.

13:51.303 --> 13:53.066
Find me some clouds!

13:53.238 --> 13:55.433
Welcome to <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

13:58.643 --> 13:59.871
Thank you.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.978
I've been to Chatsworth,
Santa Cruz, Encino, San Diego...

14:12.157 --> 14:16.025
...Riverside, Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months!

14:16.194 --> 14:17.991
Where are my goddamn clouds, huh?

14:18.163 --> 14:20.495
They move, Mr. Hughes!

14:20.665 --> 14:21.996
Clouds move.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.635
- That's what they do. They move!
- You see that?

14:24.803 --> 14:28.500
It is costing me $5271 a day...

14:28.673 --> 14:33.076
...to keep those planes on the ground.
You find me some goddamn clouds, huh?

14:40.519 --> 14:42.009
Nice day.

14:42.487 --> 14:44.387
Yeah, very funny.

14:44.656 --> 14:47.489
I got a call from Houston.
They're getting nervous.

14:47.659 --> 14:49.593
Stop showing them the damn bills.

14:49.761 --> 14:51.126
That would be illegal.

14:51.296 --> 14:53.526
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

14:53.698 --> 14:57.566
Hughes Tool is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.531
Incorporate a new division out here.
We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

15:02.707 --> 15:07.269
- Do we need these rivets on the cowling?
- Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

15:07.446 --> 15:10.142
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that.

15:10.315 --> 15:12.579
- Wind resistance on rivets?
- I want her slippery.

15:12.751 --> 15:15.777
There are tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

15:15.954 --> 15:18.422
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr. Hughes!

15:18.590 --> 15:20.387
Oakland!

15:20.559 --> 15:23.585
- We have clouds in Oakland!
- You mean it this time?

15:23.762 --> 15:25.320
Yes!

15:25.497 --> 15:28.591
Goddamn it, yes.
I can promise you.

15:28.767 --> 15:32.032
- Clouds in Oakland.
- All right, don't get all jittery now.

15:32.204 --> 15:33.603
Oakland!

15:34.506 --> 15:36.371
Oakland!

15:36.541 --> 15:39.772
We're going to Oakland!
Oakland.

16:15.947 --> 16:18.575
Down and to the left!

16:41.573 --> 16:43.564
That's perfect!

16:47.445 --> 16:51.848
That's right, Senator George.

16:52.017 --> 16:54.713
<i>Yes, young Howard Hughes</i>
<i>has pulled it off!</i>

16:54.886 --> 16:58.287
<i>After two years,</i> Hell's Angels
<i>has finally finished filming.</i>

16:58.456 --> 17:01.584
<i>There's gonna be one heck</i>
<i>of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.</i>

17:01.760 --> 17:04.455
<i>The price tag?</i>
<i>A staggering $2 million.</i>

17:04.628 --> 17:07.119
<i>If every human being</i>
<i>in America buys a ticket...</i>

17:07.299 --> 17:09.028
<i>... he might even make a profit.</i>

17:14.138 --> 17:15.470
First, clouds don't come.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.040
Then planes break down.
Then the planes crash.

17:19.711 --> 17:22.771
We've had everything but
a plague of locusts on this thing.

17:22.948 --> 17:24.313
I mean, you have to admit.

17:24.482 --> 17:28.474
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

17:30.689 --> 17:32.088
Come with me.

17:33.992 --> 17:37.257
<i>Mama, darling,</i>
<i>if I'm a success in this show...</i>

17:37.429 --> 17:39.488
<i>- ... we're gonna move from here.</i>
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

17:39.664 --> 17:41.632
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We're gonna move up in the Bronx.</i>

17:41.800 --> 17:43.859
<i>Green grass,</i>
<i>a lot of people you know.</i>

17:44.035 --> 17:46.731
<i>The Ginsbergs,</i>
<i>the Guttenbergs and the Goldbergs.</i>

17:46.905 --> 17:49.601
<i>Oh, a whole lot of "bergs."</i>
<i>I don't know them all.</i>

17:50.208 --> 17:53.974
See, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

17:54.145 --> 17:57.137
So I figure we gotta reshoot
<i>Hell's Angels</i> for sound.

17:59.551 --> 18:01.075
How much of it?

18:01.252 --> 18:03.516
All of it.
Before you ask, I'll tell you.

18:03.688 --> 18:06.555
An additional 1.7 million.
We got that much?

18:07.692 --> 18:10.957
- No!
- Well, we'll make it.

18:11.129 --> 18:12.858
Take care of that, would you?

18:13.031 --> 18:14.362
<i>Now, get this.</i>

18:24.442 --> 18:26.603
<i>In the halls of 7000 Romaine...</i>

18:26.778 --> 18:29.212
<i>... it goes on day after day,</i>
<i>month after month.</i>

18:29.381 --> 18:33.078
<i>Howard Hughes is now editing</i>
<i>some 25 miles of film.</i>

18:34.486 --> 18:39.082
<i>Heck, I say release it now and give</i>
<i>the world its first 560-hour movie.</i>

18:39.257 --> 18:43.523
Pat, Mr. Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now!

18:44.396 --> 18:45.988
<i>Enough is enough, Mr. Hughes.</i>

18:46.164 --> 18:49.361
<i>Are you ever gonna let us</i>
<i>actually see this epic of yours?</i>

18:49.534 --> 18:51.024
Hurry up!

19:12.023 --> 19:13.422
- Who is it?
- Noah.

19:13.591 --> 19:15.252
Come on in.

19:16.828 --> 19:19.422
I've been on the phone
to Houston for three hours.

19:19.597 --> 19:22.589
- We're fixing every goddamn book we have.
- Wait, wait.

19:23.535 --> 19:26.936
Yeah. Run reel 10 again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

19:27.105 --> 19:30.939
And tell Jimmy I want
10 chocolate chip cookies, all right?

19:31.109 --> 19:33.976
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside.

19:34.145 --> 19:35.635
Got it?

19:35.814 --> 19:38.146
You remember
that goddamn shot from reel 10?

19:38.316 --> 19:40.910
No. I don't remember
anything from reel 10.

19:41.086 --> 19:43.247
I don't know what reel 10 is.

19:43.421 --> 19:46.686
I'm a businessman, Howard.
And so are you.

19:46.858 --> 19:48.655
Now, look.

19:48.827 --> 19:50.294
This has been a great ride.

19:50.462 --> 19:52.396
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

19:52.797 --> 19:56.460
But you're losing
$25,000 a day doing this.

19:56.768 --> 19:58.668
Every day.

20:04.242 --> 20:07.075
So, what are my options?

20:08.646 --> 20:11.376
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

20:11.549 --> 20:13.983
I'm afraid you gotta close it down.

20:14.753 --> 20:16.345
Dig your way out.

20:23.027 --> 20:25.018
I'm sorry, Howard.

20:25.597 --> 20:27.394
I truly am.

20:34.773 --> 20:36.365
<i>Reel 10, Mr. Hughes.</i>

20:42.413 --> 20:44.438
Mortgage Tool Co.

20:45.350 --> 20:50.447
- Every asset. You heard me.
- lf you do that, you could lose everything.

20:50.622 --> 20:52.180
Well, I won't.

20:55.326 --> 20:56.793
I won't.

20:58.263 --> 21:00.060
All right.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.893
I'll get into it.

21:04.269 --> 21:05.827
Thanks, Noah.

21:40.939 --> 21:44.670
<i>More than half a million souls lining</i>
<i>the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.</i>

21:44.843 --> 21:46.470
<i>Look at the automobiles!</i>

21:46.644 --> 21:50.512
<i>There are 45,000 cars here,</i>
<i>making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen.</i>

21:50.682 --> 21:53.082
<i>Howard Hughes must have</i>
<i>a lump in his throat.</i>

21:53.251 --> 21:57.347
<i>Six months after the stock market crashes</i>
<i>and after three pilots' deaths...</i>

21:57.522 --> 22:00.491
<i>... he's finally unveiling his</i>
<i>$4 million baby doll.</i>

22:00.658 --> 22:04.958
<i>It's the most expensive movie ever made.</i>
<i>Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr. Hughes.</i>

22:05.129 --> 22:08.428
<i>Nothing like tonight has ever been</i>
<i>seen before, and I can say...</i>

22:08.600 --> 22:10.261
<i>... it will never be seen again.</i>

22:10.435 --> 22:14.428
<i>Five hundred thousand people are crowding</i>
<i>the streets to get a glimpse of the stars.</i>

22:14.606 --> 22:17.302
<i>Three companies of Marines</i>
<i>were called to assist...</i>

<i>... the 250 special police who are</i>
<i>handling this enormous crowd...</i>

22:21.079 --> 22:22.603
<i>This is an industry town.</i>

22:22.780 --> 22:25.681
<i>And nobody but nobody</i>
<i>makes a movie outside a studio.</i>

22:25.850 --> 22:29.342
<i>Some Hollywood insiders over</i>
<i>at the Brown Derby may be laughing...</i>

22:29.520 --> 22:30.987
<i>And now, I think...</i>

22:31.155 --> 22:33.988
<i>Yes, yes, I can see</i>
<i>Mr. Hughes' car arriving now.</i>

22:34.158 --> 22:37.127
<i>Mr. Hughes escorts</i>
<i>the lovely starlet Jean Harlow.</i>

22:37.295 --> 22:41.288
<i>He discovered her for this picture,</i>
<i>and we think her platinum blond locks...</i>

22:41.466 --> 22:45.732
<i>... and hot-jazz, baby-doll style</i>
<i>are gonna make her a big star.</i>

22:54.679 --> 22:56.977
Howard! Howard!

23:03.521 --> 23:05.386
Over here!

23:11.963 --> 23:16.195
- This way, boss. Right over there.
- Mr. Hughes, how about a word?

23:16.401 --> 23:18.869
Big night for you, Mr. Hughes.

23:20.805 --> 23:23.433
Big night for you tonight.

23:23.608 --> 23:25.940
Very big. Very big.

23:26.110 --> 23:29.807
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.

23:31.649 --> 23:33.412
Yes.

23:33.584 --> 23:34.983
Yeah.

23:35.153 --> 23:37.781
So 4 million clams
from your own pocket.

23:37.956 --> 23:39.583
Nervous how the flick will fly?

23:43.161 --> 23:46.460
Big night. You enjoy the show.

23:46.965 --> 23:52.335
Yes, well, let me present the feminine
star of this spectacle, <i>Hell's Angels...</i>

23:52.503 --> 23:55.097
...Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

23:55.273 --> 23:58.242
I would like to use this occasion
to thank Mr. Hughes...

23:58.409 --> 24:01.708
...for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

24:01.879 --> 24:05.246
Thank you!
Now I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle...

24:05.416 --> 24:08.385
...to introduce
his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

24:08.553 --> 24:11.215
What's the matter with you?
Can't remember my name?

24:11.389 --> 24:15.382
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner,
and this would be Gilmore.

24:58.503 --> 25:00.164
It's going! It's going!

25:01.839 --> 25:05.275
Murder! That's what this
dirty, rotten politician war is, murder!

25:05.443 --> 25:06.910
You know it as well as I do.

25:44.682 --> 25:46.274
Stand up, slim, take a bow.

25:59.897 --> 26:02.127
Reel four played too long.
Too many coughs.

26:02.300 --> 26:06.259
Get the team out of the party and
to the office. I wanna cut a few shots.

26:06.437 --> 26:08.667
Oh, find Glenn.
Somebody write this down.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.068
Flush rivets.
Got that?

26:10.241 --> 26:11.936
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.634
Lickety-split, boss.

26:13.878 --> 26:15.505
Here he is! Here he is!

26:17.582 --> 26:19.482
Variety <i>says, "This one won't miss!"</i>

26:19.650 --> 26:22.915
<i>- Magnificently photographed!</i>
<i>- Awesome beyond description!</i>

26:23.087 --> 26:26.682
<i>The most extraordinary output</i>
<i>to emerge from a motion-picture studio.</i>

26:26.858 --> 26:29.793
<i>Not for a long time have I seen</i>
<i>anything as enthralling.</i>

26:29.961 --> 26:32.987
<i>It costs 4 million dollars</i>
<i>and has 4 million thrills!</i>

26:33.164 --> 26:35.462
<i>- Majestically...</i>
<i>- Most epic picture of its time!</i>

27:30.922 --> 27:33.891
A lighter shade. I don't want
to look like Boris Karloff.

27:34.058 --> 27:35.650
If you know what I mean.

27:37.595 --> 27:41.531
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

27:41.699 --> 27:43.360
On occasion.

27:43.534 --> 27:45.764
Well, how about nine holes?

27:47.872 --> 27:50.033
Now, Mr. Hughes?

27:50.708 --> 27:53.438
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.458
You're not extending
enough on your follow-through.

28:19.637 --> 28:22.572
Follow-through
is everything in golf, just like life.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.037
Don't you find?

28:24.208 --> 28:26.233
Saw your <i>Scarface</i> picture.

28:26.410 --> 28:27.707
- Violent.
- Realistic.

28:27.878 --> 28:30.210
Movies are movies, Howard.
Not life.

28:30.381 --> 28:32.076
Now the stage.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.478
The stage is real.

28:33.651 --> 28:37.644
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right out there in front of you, buster.

28:37.822 --> 28:40.791
Can't look away. Can't munch popcorn.
That would be rude.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.220
Do you like the theater?

28:42.526 --> 28:45.017
- No.
- Oh, I adore the theater.

28:45.196 --> 28:47.357
Only alive on-stage.
I'll teach you.

28:47.531 --> 28:51.467
We'll see some Ibsen. If the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now.

28:51.636 --> 28:54.662
You're not a Republican, are you?
How did you vote in '32?

28:54.839 --> 28:58.297
- Well, I didn't.
- You must! It's your sacred franchise.

29:02.179 --> 29:04.943
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

29:05.116 --> 29:07.448
She's just a friend.

29:07.618 --> 29:09.313
Men can't be friends with women.

29:09.487 --> 29:11.546
They must possess them
or leave them be.

29:11.722 --> 29:14.850
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.
It's all in Darwin.

29:15.026 --> 29:20.362
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.
That's the male sex all over.

29:21.032 --> 29:22.397
Excuse me?

29:23.200 --> 29:26.192
Well, if you're deaf,
you must own up to it.

29:26.470 --> 29:28.404
Get a hearing aid.
Or see my father.

29:28.572 --> 29:32.235
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

29:32.576 --> 29:34.043
Me, I keep healthy.

29:34.211 --> 29:36.338
I take seven showers a day
to keep clean.

29:36.514 --> 29:39.847
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy."

29:40.017 --> 29:44.010
I'm not outdoorsy.
I'm athletic. I sweat.

29:44.188 --> 29:46.952
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

29:47.124 --> 29:49.592
I sweat and you're deaf.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.627
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

29:56.200 --> 29:58.065
Three.

30:05.609 --> 30:07.440
Noble effort.

30:09.814 --> 30:12.510
So I suppose you're
wooing me now?

30:13.184 --> 30:15.175
Oh, well.

30:34.238 --> 30:35.728
Not enough.

30:36.307 --> 30:39.333
Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

30:39.510 --> 30:42.411
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

30:42.646 --> 30:45.444
I want no wind resistance
on the fuselage.

30:45.616 --> 30:47.914
She has got to be clean, Odie.

30:48.085 --> 30:49.848
- Clean. Understand?
- Okay, Howard.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.817
I don't know
what else to tell you.

30:52.890 --> 30:56.451
- What do you got for me?
- The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.

30:56.627 --> 30:59.255
- A modern plane.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of plane?

30:59.430 --> 31:01.660
Okay. The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats...

31:01.832 --> 31:04.266
...and 14 overnight berths.
- Something bigger?

31:05.603 --> 31:07.969
Try 50 seats with
a ceiling of 12,000 feet.

31:08.139 --> 31:10.369
No. No, 20,000.

31:10.741 --> 31:12.868
Think about it.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

31:13.043 --> 31:15.637
- Less turbulence.
- Because it's above the weather.

31:15.813 --> 31:18.179
Jack, we wanna fly
above the weather.

31:18.349 --> 31:21.910
Only 1 percent of the American population
has set foot on an airliner.

31:22.086 --> 31:24.850
Why? Because they're scared to death.
They should be.

31:25.022 --> 31:27.616
I mean, 7000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

31:27.792 --> 31:30.283
We build a plane
that flies above the weather...

31:30.461 --> 31:34.227
...we could get every man, woman
and child in this country to feel safe.

31:34.398 --> 31:38.892
An airplane with the ability to fly into
the substratosphere across the country.

31:39.069 --> 31:40.900
Across the world.

31:41.071 --> 31:43.164
Now that is the future.

31:43.607 --> 31:44.835
- You with me?
- Yeah.

31:45.009 --> 31:48.945
I don't wanna get into this
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

31:49.113 --> 31:51.411
- Would they support us?
- I don't know.

31:51.582 --> 31:53.812
- What's your financial picture?
- Not great.

31:53.984 --> 31:56.145
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

31:56.320 --> 31:59.016
- What's it selling at?
- About 8 dollars a share.

31:59.190 --> 32:00.919
That's the lowest it's been, huh?

32:02.893 --> 32:04.360
I could do that.

32:04.528 --> 32:06.018
- Do what?
- Buy it.

32:06.197 --> 32:08.859
- You wanna buy the airline?
- For crying out loud...

32:09.033 --> 32:12.935
...we don't want pencil pushers getting
in the way of us making our plane.

32:13.103 --> 32:16.937
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

32:17.975 --> 32:19.374
Call it 15 million.

32:21.779 --> 32:23.940
That is a chunk of change, huh?

32:27.384 --> 32:29.215
You call Noah Dietrich.

32:29.386 --> 32:31.354
You have him start buying.

32:31.522 --> 32:32.784
Howard, hold on.

32:32.957 --> 32:35.983
Are you sure?
You wanna think about it for five minutes?

32:36.160 --> 32:39.994
Hell, Jack, I got a tiger by the tail here.
I ain't gonna let it go.

32:48.806 --> 32:50.535
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

32:50.708 --> 32:53.074
Welcome. Your table is ready.

32:54.245 --> 32:55.769
How goes the aviation?

32:55.946 --> 32:58.915
- Oh, just fine, Pete.
- I'm so glad.

33:01.252 --> 33:02.583
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

33:02.753 --> 33:03.981
- Madame.
- It's "miss."

33:04.154 --> 33:06.588
Miss. The usual, Mr. Hughes?

33:06.757 --> 33:08.884
- Please.
- May I recommend for the lady...

33:09.059 --> 33:12.551
...our clementine soup followed
by roast duck with currant glaze...

33:12.730 --> 33:15.699
...and poached pears in rose sauce.
It's truly divine.

33:15.866 --> 33:17.356
Yeah. That sounds fine.

33:19.537 --> 33:22.267
Your kind of joint, is it?

33:23.407 --> 33:24.965
Wouldn't have thought.

33:25.142 --> 33:28.339
They're open late.
I go to a hot-dog stand on La Cienega too.

33:28.512 --> 33:31.174
- They're open till about 4.
- Are they?

33:33.217 --> 33:35.048
How marvelous.

33:50.901 --> 33:52.528
Howard! Howard!

33:53.504 --> 33:56.268
Hi! Son of a gun.

33:56.440 --> 34:00.274
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer.
I suppose you could call him my press agent.

34:00.444 --> 34:02.708
- Pleased to meet you. Loved <i>Alice Adams.</i>
- You're too kind.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.576
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?
- Mr. Flynn. Yes.

34:05.749 --> 34:10.618
Kate. Kate. Kate of the clenched-jawed
Hepburns. Enchanting as always.

34:10.788 --> 34:13.484
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

34:13.657 --> 34:15.818
You and Howard
ought to cook up a picture.

34:15.993 --> 34:18.518
Costar with Errol.
I could sell that in spades.

34:18.696 --> 34:20.891
That would be marvelous. Howard?

34:21.498 --> 34:25.228
I think not.
Don't you read <i>Variety,</i> Mr. Meyer?

34:25.402 --> 34:29.099
Well, I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

34:29.273 --> 34:32.639
Washed-up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

34:32.810 --> 34:36.643
Hell with them. Hell with them, my dear.
Soulless pricks to a man, right?

34:36.813 --> 34:40.841
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

34:44.922 --> 34:47.686
Are you making a Western, Howard?

34:47.891 --> 34:50.655
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it <i>The Outlaw.</i>

34:50.828 --> 34:52.989
Yeah. And you know
what it's about? S-E-X.

34:53.163 --> 34:55.859
- It's all about S-E-X.
- It's a Western.

34:56.033 --> 34:58.934
You can't have fornication in a Western.
It isn't done.

34:59.103 --> 35:00.900
It's not real sex, it's movie sex.

35:01.071 --> 35:04.734
What <i>Scarface</i> did for the gangster picture,
<i>The Outlaw</i> will do for the Western.

35:04.908 --> 35:07.775
Put the sex and guts and blood
up there on the screen.

35:07.945 --> 35:09.970
- Have you seen my cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

35:10.147 --> 35:13.548
New York cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

35:13.717 --> 35:16.948
- You can't afford your own cigarettes?
- Jack has all my money.

35:17.121 --> 35:21.421
I hope your food isn't getting cold
at your table somewhere or something.

35:21.592 --> 35:23.890
No, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

35:24.061 --> 35:29.590
Now, Howard. Now, Howard. If you're
seriously talking about putting carnality...

35:29.767 --> 35:34.431
...back on the silver screen, you must swear
to let me in on the casting session.

35:37.574 --> 35:42.443
- I have an eye for talent. Isn't that right?
- You ought to give up prancing in tights...

35:42.613 --> 35:46.208
...be a talent scout.
- That prancing paid for my new yacht.

35:46.383 --> 35:49.841
You must all come sailing with me.
Catalina. What do you say?

35:50.020 --> 35:53.183
- Catalina. Sounds grand. Yeah.
- I've even managed to coax...

35:53.357 --> 35:57.225
...the luscious Miss De Havilland
and her equally luscious sister to come.

35:57.394 --> 36:02.263
Though I fear their mother will insist on
coming, to preserve their questionable virtue.

36:02.433 --> 36:06.631
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

36:06.804 --> 36:08.863
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

36:09.273 --> 36:11.434
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:15.746 --> 36:17.043
I gotta go.

36:17.915 --> 36:21.442
If you'll excuse us, we have...
We have to be somewhere.

36:21.785 --> 36:24.253
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

36:24.421 --> 36:27.447
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

36:27.624 --> 36:31.253
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

36:31.895 --> 36:34.659
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:35.532 --> 36:36.863
Was that meant for me?

36:37.034 --> 36:40.401
My hero. God, all that
Hollywood talk bores me silly.

36:40.571 --> 36:43.540
As if there aren't more important things,
like Mussolini.

36:43.707 --> 36:47.643
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

36:47.811 --> 36:49.745
Do your worst, Mr. Hughes.

36:49.913 --> 36:54.111
- Think you own this place, you limey bastard?
- I'm a Tasmanian bastard, you prick.

36:54.284 --> 36:56.684
- Thataway, Errol.
- Let me at him!

37:30.287 --> 37:32.983
That's Mr. Mayer's house right there.

37:33.157 --> 37:35.057
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

37:44.334 --> 37:48.134
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

37:48.305 --> 37:52.173
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands.

37:52.709 --> 37:54.336
What kind of crap?

37:55.045 --> 37:56.706
You don't wanna know.

38:01.985 --> 38:03.919
Hold on to the wheel for a bit.

38:11.995 --> 38:15.123
That's too hard. Relax your hand.
Relax your hand.

38:20.804 --> 38:25.764
You see, you gotta feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

38:25.943 --> 38:29.003
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

38:31.615 --> 38:33.276
Well, that's good.

38:33.917 --> 38:35.612
Golly!

38:40.023 --> 38:41.820
Well, she's all yours.

38:42.059 --> 38:45.722
- Where are you going?!
- I think there's some milk back here.

38:46.730 --> 38:49.528
- You just keep us steady, now.
- All right.

39:08.518 --> 39:10.349
- Howard.
- Yeah?

39:10.520 --> 39:13.489
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

39:13.657 --> 39:15.852
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

39:20.697 --> 39:23.291
Golly!

39:28.839 --> 39:34.004
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly."

39:41.251 --> 39:43.719
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

39:43.887 --> 39:45.878
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

39:51.261 --> 39:54.958
- You want some milk?
- Oh, please.

40:16.887 --> 40:19.117
Utterly smashing!
We'll do it again.

40:19.289 --> 40:22.452
I'm free Wednesday.
It's a little early for golf, though.

40:22.626 --> 40:24.890
Oh, no, no. I live right there.

40:25.395 --> 40:27.955
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.363
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

40:32.602 --> 40:36.299
My decorator
picked out the wallpaper and such.

40:36.940 --> 40:38.999
He's queer as a bedbug.

40:39.176 --> 40:41.906
But I just hate this room.

40:42.212 --> 40:44.043
Gives me the willies.

40:44.548 --> 40:48.644
Like I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of <i>Town & Country.</i>

40:57.294 --> 40:59.057
What room do you like?

41:00.330 --> 41:01.820
My study.

41:04.201 --> 41:05.862
Take me there.

41:22.219 --> 41:25.245
You are the tallest woman I know.

41:26.189 --> 41:30.285
And all sharp elbows and knees.
Beware.

41:52.816 --> 41:55.876
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

41:58.488 --> 42:00.683
It is tomorrow.

42:53.477 --> 42:57.243
Keep your eye on the fuel. She's got
a minimum to keep her weight down.

42:57.414 --> 43:00.440
Two runs. That's it.
After that, you're flying on vapors.

43:00.617 --> 43:03.381
And then you crash and you die.
Give her easy flying.

43:03.553 --> 43:06.852
Don't worry about speed
and don't think about the record today.

43:07.023 --> 43:10.481
I wish you'd let someone else take her.
You've got 20 test pilots.

43:10.660 --> 43:14.994
Hell, why should I let someone else
have all the fun? See you in a bit.

43:35.952 --> 43:37.715
Contact!

45:07.344 --> 45:08.572
339.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.545
Goddamn!

45:34.271 --> 45:35.795
347.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.537
Son of a bitch!

46:10.907 --> 46:13.467
- 352.
- 352!

46:14.711 --> 46:15.939
Good girl.

46:25.722 --> 46:27.417
Damn it!

46:31.227 --> 46:33.354
Goddamn it!

46:33.797 --> 46:36.027
- Oh, God!
- There goes our meal ticket.

46:36.199 --> 46:37.689
Come on!

47:17.841 --> 47:19.274
Howard!

47:19.442 --> 47:21.603
- Howard!
- How did we do?

47:22.712 --> 47:25.044
352 on the last run.

47:26.816 --> 47:28.443
She'll go faster.

47:29.018 --> 47:30.645
Country mouse!

47:31.421 --> 47:34.822
- Kate! Katie!
- Upstairs, city mouse.

47:37.927 --> 47:40.828
Hello.
Good Lord, what happened to you?

47:40.997 --> 47:43.227
Oh, nothing. A hard landing.
I cut my foot.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.426
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

47:46.603 --> 47:50.437
You cannot imagine what it was like, Katie.
You cannot imagine the speed.

47:50.607 --> 47:53.770
- She was like a winged bullet up there.
- What did she make?

47:53.943 --> 47:58.107
Oh, around 352.

48:05.088 --> 48:06.555
You did it!

48:07.891 --> 48:09.756
Fastest man on the planet.

48:09.926 --> 48:13.157
Hot dog! I'm so proud of you.

48:13.329 --> 48:15.320
- She did it, baby.
- You knew she would.

48:15.498 --> 48:18.467
Oh, she was fine. She was just fine.

48:19.669 --> 48:21.227
Now let me see your foot.

48:21.471 --> 48:22.768
Yeah.

48:23.473 --> 48:27.034
- Good God! You're covered in blood.
- Oh, no. That's just beet juice.

48:27.210 --> 48:29.371
- I crashed into a beet field.
- What?

48:29.546 --> 48:31.741
Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

48:34.951 --> 48:37.044
Let me get you cleaned up.

48:38.054 --> 48:42.582
- Heavens, what is this? Electrical tape?
- Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

48:43.626 --> 48:48.654
But all I could think about
was getting home to see you.

48:53.369 --> 48:56.236
I am so proud of you.

49:00.777 --> 49:03.143
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

49:03.313 --> 49:07.113
Oh, this is useless.
Come to the bathroom.

49:08.351 --> 49:11.218
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't, I won't.

49:11.387 --> 49:14.049
- Too hot!
- Don't be a baby.

49:15.725 --> 49:18.558
Was the press there?

49:19.496 --> 49:20.758
Some.

49:20.997 --> 49:26.094
But they're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

49:34.711 --> 49:36.269
What is it?

49:38.982 --> 49:40.574
Kate?

49:43.820 --> 49:46.914
I've been famous,
for better or worse...

49:47.457 --> 49:49.425
...for a long time now...

49:49.592 --> 49:53.926
...and I wonder if you know what it...

49:54.564 --> 49:56.361
...really means.

49:57.534 --> 50:00.628
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

50:01.404 --> 50:03.201
I'm used to it.

50:05.141 --> 50:06.836
Are you?

50:10.513 --> 50:12.276
Howard, we're...

50:15.218 --> 50:17.652
We're not like everyone else.

50:19.656 --> 50:24.593
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

50:25.361 --> 50:28.228
We have to be very careful not to...

50:29.532 --> 50:33.366
...let people in,
or they'll make us into freaks.

50:34.571 --> 50:39.133
Kate, they can't get in here.
We're safe.

50:40.843 --> 50:42.743
They can always get in.

50:44.914 --> 50:48.315
When my brother killed himself...

50:49.485 --> 50:52.045
...there were photographers
at the funeral.

50:53.289 --> 50:55.519
There's no decency to it.

51:07.971 --> 51:10.030
You know, sometimes I...

51:13.776 --> 51:15.937
I get these feelings, Katie.

51:20.917 --> 51:23.477
I get these ideas, these...

51:26.322 --> 51:28.916
...crazy ideas about...

51:31.361 --> 51:33.727
...things that may not...

51:34.998 --> 51:37.865
Things that may not really be there.

51:38.534 --> 51:40.058
Yeah.

51:46.743 --> 51:49.507
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm...

51:51.547 --> 51:53.515
...losing my mind.

52:01.090 --> 52:02.955
And if I did, it would...

52:06.062 --> 52:08.428
It'd be like flying blind.

52:16.572 --> 52:18.233
You understand?

52:22.412 --> 52:25.210
You taught me to fly, Howard.

52:28.184 --> 52:30.175
I'll take the wheel.

52:46.102 --> 52:50.129
<i>Smashing all records, Howard Hughes</i>
<i>outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.</i>

52:50.440 --> 52:53.705
<i>Around the world from New York</i>
<i>to New York in four days.</i>

52:53.876 --> 52:56.811
<i>Even beating Wiley Post's mark</i>
<i>by over three days.</i>

52:56.979 --> 53:00.210
<i>New aviation history is written</i>
<i>when his Lockheed monoplane...</i>

53:00.383 --> 53:03.375
<i>... returns swiftly and safely.</i>
<i>A daring aviator.</i>

53:03.820 --> 53:06.482
<i>A true pioneer of the world's airways.</i>

53:06.656 --> 53:10.649
<i>From New York to Paris, he cuts Lindbergh's</i>

53:10.827 --> 53:15.389

53:15.565 --> 53:20.195
<i>Sixty hours out of New York, he heads</i>

You won't believe this. It just came over the
wires. Hughes has bought control of TWA.

53:43.993 --> 53:46.860
I thought Mr. Hughes
was flying around the world.

53:47.063 --> 53:50.464
Apparently he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

53:57.673 --> 54:00.972
I have heard some disquieting rumors
about Mr. Hughes.

54:02.545 --> 54:05.981
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr. Hughes.

54:08.417 --> 54:10.647
I'd like you to attend to that for me.

54:11.654 --> 54:13.281
Thoroughly.

54:13.856 --> 54:16.290
<i>The Pantages is glittering tonight.</i>

54:16.459 --> 54:19.292
- Howard!
- Right over here. This way, over to the left.

54:19.462 --> 54:22.124
- Mr. Hughes, how was your flight?
- Miss Hepburn!

54:22.298 --> 54:24.960
- When are you gonna name the day?
- Raise your head.

54:25.134 --> 54:27.261
What's the next movie?
Give us the scoop.

54:27.436 --> 54:30.132
Right here. How many more
records are you gonna set?

54:30.306 --> 54:33.605
Right over here. Come on.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

54:33.776 --> 54:35.676
- Howard, this way.
- Beautiful.

54:35.845 --> 54:38.336
Over here, over here, Mr. Hughes.

54:38.514 --> 54:40.948
When are you gonna fly
around the world again?

54:41.117 --> 54:45.110
You gonna fly with Kate next time?
Did you get lonely without her?

54:45.288 --> 54:49.349
- Talk to Lindbergh about your flight yet?
- Where's Linda Darnell tonight?

54:49.525 --> 54:52.824
- Please, Mr. Hughes.
- Right here. Right here, Mr. Hughes.

54:52.995 --> 54:55.486
Are you trying to be more famous
than Lindbergh?

54:56.199 --> 54:59.930
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

55:02.171 --> 55:03.798
L. B!

55:06.442 --> 55:09.809
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

55:09.979 --> 55:12.004
You look so beautiful.

55:19.789 --> 55:21.416
Is that true?

55:30.233 --> 55:32.098
Don't worry about it, Howard.

55:32.268 --> 55:35.931
She's just working the room.
It's her job, baby.

55:38.975 --> 55:42.775
<i>Sultry Southern tigress Ava Gardner</i>
<i>dazzles the room tonight.</i>

55:42.945 --> 55:45.175
<i>She's the newest star</i>
<i>in the MGM galaxy.</i>

55:45.348 --> 55:48.977
<i>And believe you me,</i>
<i>she puts the "cheese" in "cheesecake."</i>

55:51.220 --> 55:56.749
Well, <i>Jane Eyre</i> has been selling popcorn
for over a hundred years, L.B.

56:37.500 --> 56:38.933
Hello.

56:40.569 --> 56:42.127
Hello.

56:47.343 --> 56:50.210
Could you reach me a towel?

56:57.653 --> 56:59.382
I...

57:00.523 --> 57:03.754
I really can't do that.

57:05.394 --> 57:06.918
I'm sorry.

57:31.754 --> 57:36.088
I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot,
and I'm sorry.

57:36.425 --> 57:40.020
- Forget it.
- No, no. I'm a vain, preening ass...

57:40.196 --> 57:45.190
...without a single redeeming feature.
- That's not true. You have very good teeth.

57:45.701 --> 57:47.168
Come on.

57:48.037 --> 57:52.371
I've got a better idea. Take me flying.
Or better yet, I'll take you flying.

57:52.541 --> 57:54.270
Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

58:03.386 --> 58:07.220
Don't be so squirmy. You're gonna
get on famously with Father and Mother.

58:07.390 --> 58:11.019
And I'm sure they'll like you too.
Once they get to know you.

58:19.335 --> 58:22.133
- Hello! Hello!
- Kath, hello.

58:22.304 --> 58:23.862
Kathy.

58:26.809 --> 58:30.540
- Who's that with the camera right there?
- That's my ex-husband, Ludlow.

58:30.713 --> 58:32.977
Father and Mother are just mad
about Luddie.

58:33.149 --> 58:37.483
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Oh, he's here all the time.

58:38.387 --> 58:40.014
Hello!

58:41.524 --> 58:42.991
Sorry we're late.

58:43.159 --> 58:45.457
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, thank you.

58:45.628 --> 58:47.255
- Dad.
- Darling.

58:47.430 --> 58:50.729
- Uncle Willy.
- Oh, who have we got here?

58:50.900 --> 58:53.630
- Don't feel self-conscious.
- Hepburns! Hepburns!

58:53.803 --> 58:57.569
Attention, please. This is Howard.

58:57.840 --> 58:59.671
Howard, welcome.

59:01.010 --> 59:03.103
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

59:04.747 --> 59:06.612
He likes you. That's unusual.

59:06.782 --> 59:10.115
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

59:10.286 --> 59:14.245
Julian's a painter. Abstract, of course.
What's the point of painting...

59:14.423 --> 59:17.790
...something real when you can just
take a picture nowadays?

59:17.960 --> 59:20.428
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr. Hughes?

59:20.863 --> 59:23.388
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

59:23.566 --> 59:24.999
We are not.

59:26.235 --> 59:28.829
You've met Mr. Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

59:32.041 --> 59:34.066
What are you sniggering at?

59:34.243 --> 59:36.609
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

59:37.379 --> 59:40.371
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

59:40.549 --> 59:42.517
- Oh, my God!
- Buster!

59:42.685 --> 59:43.913
Hey. Hey!

59:45.588 --> 59:47.055
Don't you like dogs?

59:47.223 --> 59:49.885
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr. Roosevelt.

59:50.059 --> 59:51.788
- Please leave.
- No. I wasn't.

59:51.961 --> 59:54.930
- I thought everybody liked dogs.
- Perhaps he had a bad experience.

59:55.097 --> 59:57.565
Does it upset you
that Howard gets more press?

59:57.733 --> 01:00:00.896
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:05.632
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:09.574
- The press can be a damned nuisance.
- Was it a Doberman?

01:00:09.745 --> 01:00:12.839
- A Doberman, Mr. Hughes? Or a dachshund?
- Neither, sir.

01:00:13.015 --> 01:00:17.247
- Dachshunds are little dogs, Hep dear.
- They should all be lined up and shot.

01:00:17.419 --> 01:00:20.616
- What's that Spanish painting?
- The Goya.

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.984
Goya. Of course. Yes.

01:00:23.626 --> 01:00:26.789
- Yes, Mexican.
- What was that called?

01:00:26.962 --> 01:00:31.092
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr. Hughes?

01:00:32.735 --> 01:00:35.568
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

01:00:35.738 --> 01:00:39.606
- Snuff?
- These would be flying magazines?

01:00:41.243 --> 01:00:43.677
- What was that?
- Oh, he's a little deaf.

01:00:43.846 --> 01:00:47.179
- Pass the goddamn butter, I beg you.
- You read flying magazines?

01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:50.409
Trade journals. On engineering. Aviation.

01:00:50.586 --> 01:00:52.315
We read books.

01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:56.987
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new airplane.

01:00:57.159 --> 01:00:59.150
Oh, really? Do tell.

01:01:02.398 --> 01:01:03.922
Well...

01:01:05.668 --> 01:01:10.332
...it's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:12.633
A twin-engine plane with some...

01:01:12.808 --> 01:01:15.800
...I must admit,
some rather unique design features.

01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:18.538
You see,
it has these two booms at the back...

01:01:18.714 --> 01:01:21.774
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that, dear?

01:01:22.051 --> 01:01:25.248
- Yes, well, a mere trifle, darling.
- I remember the painting!

01:01:25.421 --> 01:01:28.083
The painting, it's called
<i>May 18-0-</i> something.

01:01:28.257 --> 01:01:31.124
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

01:01:31.293 --> 01:01:33.989
- Nonsense! Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

01:01:34.163 --> 01:01:37.030
- It was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster.

01:01:37.199 --> 01:01:39.861
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:42.196
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk!

01:01:42.371 --> 01:01:45.670
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs. Hepburn. Nothing.

01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:49.709
Why did you speak? I can't abide people
who speak but have nothing to say.

01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:53.541
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

01:01:53.716 --> 01:01:55.274
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

01:01:55.451 --> 01:01:58.215
Well, Howard just flew round
the world in three days.

01:01:58.387 --> 01:02:01.322
- I think we've had enough about airplanes.
- And dogs.

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:05.221
- Then how did you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

01:02:05.394 --> 01:02:07.362
Well, that's because you have it.

01:02:11.367 --> 01:02:12.698
Would you repeat that?

01:02:14.036 --> 01:02:16.971
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:20.108
- How did you make all that..?
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

01:02:20.276 --> 01:02:21.504
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:23.144
All right.

01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:26.013
Some of us choose to work for a living.

01:02:26.181 --> 01:02:31.448
Speaking of which, I have more of that
airplane guff to attend to.

01:02:32.354 --> 01:02:33.912
Excuse me.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:44.192
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

01:02:44.633 --> 01:02:47.625
You're a fine bunch of bullies,
aren't you?

01:02:47.803 --> 01:02:51.102
Have you talked to Mr. Mayer
about letting you do <i>Jane Eyre</i> ?

01:02:51.273 --> 01:02:54.572
The old philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

01:02:54.743 --> 01:02:59.680
I'm convinced the man hasn't read anything
longer than a <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i> in his life.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.508
No fair, kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

01:03:06.322 --> 01:03:10.053
Really, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that...

01:03:10.225 --> 01:03:13.683
...or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:16.497
You're like a different person in there.

01:03:17.266 --> 01:03:20.064
They just expect me to be a certain way.

01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:26.270
There's only one real Kate,
and that's your Kate.

01:03:29.745 --> 01:03:34.444
<i>Over in Hollywood, aviation tycoon</i>
<i>Howard Hughes is cooking up something big.</i>

01:03:34.616 --> 01:03:39.110
<i>Even as he edits his new picture, he's been</i>
<i>secretly meeting with the U.S. Air Corps.</i>

01:03:39.288 --> 01:03:42.849
<i>We applaud his patriotism and look forward</i>
<i>to his newest marvel.</i>

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:46.426
You know how many Allied ships we lost
because of U-boat attacks?

01:03:46.595 --> 01:03:48.722
- No.
- Six hundred and eighty-one ships...

01:03:48.897 --> 01:03:53.493
...just this year so far. The Army needs
a new airplane to fly the troops to Europe.

01:03:53.669 --> 01:03:57.161
These ships, they're sitting ducks
for the U-boats.

01:03:57.339 --> 01:04:01.002
- You wanna build a troop-carrier plane?
- Stop thinking like an insect.

01:04:01.176 --> 01:04:04.111
Not just to carry troops,
a plane to carry everything.

01:04:04.279 --> 01:04:08.545
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:11.783
No. Other side.

01:04:14.723 --> 01:04:18.250
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan, around 300.

01:04:18.427 --> 01:04:20.987
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

01:04:22.297 --> 01:04:25.391
Now, this is just what Kaiser
and the Army are looking for.

01:04:25.567 --> 01:04:29.059
- They're gonna pay for it this time.
- What are you getting us into?

01:04:29.238 --> 01:04:32.105
Well, it's a big plane,
so I'm calling it The Hercules.

01:04:32.608 --> 01:04:34.132
Swell name, isn't it?

01:04:34.576 --> 01:04:37.739
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:43.407
Well, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:46.980
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

01:04:47.156 --> 01:04:51.616
Should give the proper uplift ratios and
reduce need for torque support on the front.

01:04:51.794 --> 01:04:55.525
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

01:04:55.697 --> 01:04:58.222
I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

01:05:01.036 --> 01:05:04.199
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard...

01:05:04.706 --> 01:05:09.336
...do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

01:05:09.545 --> 01:05:12.412
Sure. Who doesn't like tits?

01:05:22.825 --> 01:05:26.090
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:29.788
Please record that Mr. Hughes has arrived
and this session is now called to order.

01:05:30.966 --> 01:05:33.730
- I yield the floor to Mr. Breen.
- Mr. Hughes...

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:37.804
...members of the committee, I've reviewed
the photoplay entitled <i>The Outlaw...</i>

01:05:37.973 --> 01:05:41.704
...and I can state that I have never seen
anything so unacceptable...

01:05:41.877 --> 01:05:45.813
...as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:50.277
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries, which are quite large...

01:05:50.452 --> 01:05:53.649
...and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:58.856
For this reason, I concluded the picture
appeals only to prurient interests...

01:05:59.027 --> 01:06:03.555
...and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

01:06:04.199 --> 01:06:06.429
Really, Mr. Hughes.

01:06:06.602 --> 01:06:10.231
- Thank you, Mr. Breen. Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:12.733
Mr. Breen. It's good to see you again.

01:06:12.908 --> 01:06:17.038
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in <i>Scarface.</i>

01:06:17.246 --> 01:06:20.374
The situation here revolves
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:23.109
Mr. Breen feels that they are
too prominent, yes?

01:06:23.285 --> 01:06:26.652
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

01:06:26.822 --> 01:06:29.450
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

01:06:32.961 --> 01:06:34.394
Jean Harlow.

01:06:36.331 --> 01:06:37.958
Ann Sheridan.

01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:40.834
Irene Dunne.

01:06:41.003 --> 01:06:42.630
Claudette Colbert.

01:06:43.238 --> 01:06:44.933
Rita Hayworth.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:49.674
Betty Grable.
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

01:06:49.845 --> 01:06:54.214
Now, all these shots, save for Miss Russell,
were enlarged from pictures...

01:06:54.383 --> 01:06:57.648
...that received
Mr. Breen's seal of approval.

01:06:58.287 --> 01:07:03.384
Now, as you've probably noticed by now,
they all contain mammaries.

01:07:04.359 --> 01:07:07.385
I will ask my associate to join me now.
May I introduce...

01:07:07.563 --> 01:07:11.260
...Dr. Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University.

01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:14.566
Dr. Branson...

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:18.628
...is a mathematician of some note.

01:07:18.807 --> 01:07:21.298
Yes. And he will now demonstrate...

01:07:21.476 --> 01:07:23.205
...that in fact...

01:07:23.378 --> 01:07:26.905
...Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent...

01:07:27.082 --> 01:07:29.880
...than any of these other fine ladies'.

01:07:32.421 --> 01:07:33.683
Doctor.

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.782
Doctor...

01:07:37.659 --> 01:07:39.923
...you forgot your calipers.

01:07:46.702 --> 01:07:49.933
Gentlemen, Mr. Hughes.

01:07:52.674 --> 01:07:55.199
Let us commence by calling this...

01:07:56.044 --> 01:07:58.342
...Mammary Exhibit Number One.

01:07:58.513 --> 01:08:04.281
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage...

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.217
...if I may, is...

01:08:09.257 --> 01:08:11.452
...5 inches and a quarter.

01:08:11.827 --> 01:08:13.192
Now if we move to Mammary Exhibit...

01:08:13.362 --> 01:08:14.829
<i>Dateline: Hollywoodland.</i>

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:18.488
<i>Movie tycoon Howard Hughes</i>
<i>must have the greatest job in the land.</i>

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:22.103
<i>Every night, the lucky guy escorts</i>
<i>a different beautiful woman...</i>

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:24.203
<i>... to a different dazzling event.</i>

01:08:24.372 --> 01:08:29.037
<i>The TWA king always talks up</i>
<i>his airline as he escorts a succession...</i>

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:33.473
<i>The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.116
<i>The Hercules.</i>

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:39.219
<i>A plane, a boat, a flying city.</i>

01:08:39.388 --> 01:08:42.845
Don't forget, every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

01:08:43.024 --> 01:08:46.461
Those men decide whether to fund
the plane, so I need them happy.

01:08:46.828 --> 01:08:49.091
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

01:08:49.497 --> 01:08:51.796
How are the girls
in the bomb department?

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:55.801
Well, let's put it this way,
it'll be a regular boob buffet.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:59.064
I don't think the Air Corps men
will have trouble scoring.

01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:02.904
- Good.
<i>- And inside, 700 brave American soldiers...</i>

01:09:03.078 --> 01:09:07.572
<i>... a dozen Sherman tanks all winging</i>
<i>their way over the Atlantic...</i>

01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:10.183
<i>... free from the threats</i>
<i>of the U-boats below.</i>

01:09:10.352 --> 01:09:14.685
<i>Could Jules Verne himself have</i>
<i>ever imagined anything so magnificent?</i>

01:09:14.856 --> 01:09:18.792
<i>Could he have imagined her mammoth</i>
<i>wingspan, longer than a football field?</i>

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.790
Don't you see how this demeans me?

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:23.294
Since when do you care
about scandal rags?

01:09:23.465 --> 01:09:26.764
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's a slap in the face.

01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:29.904
- Don't you understand that?
- Well, that's overstating it.

01:09:30.072 --> 01:09:33.404
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine...

01:09:33.575 --> 01:09:36.475
...and now Bette Davis,
for God's sake.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:43.511
Look, they're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:46.654
Oh, very nice.

01:09:48.323 --> 01:09:51.224
You're the one that said
that all men are predators.

01:09:51.393 --> 01:09:54.294
I mean, it's all in Darwin, remember?

01:09:54.629 --> 01:09:58.224
And am I to expect this behavior
to continue after the wedding?

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.459
What is really bothering you, Kate?

01:10:00.635 --> 01:10:03.900
Is it the women or the publicity?

01:10:09.144 --> 01:10:13.376
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:24.050
Don't you dare.

01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:36.999
Yeah.

01:10:38.173 --> 01:10:41.768
No, Odie, this is not a good time.

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:46.174
For chrissakes, we can't make The Hercules
if we don't have any aluminum.

01:10:46.348 --> 01:10:47.940
Wait.

01:10:48.116 --> 01:10:51.176
I can hear you better now.
Tell the War Production Board...

01:10:51.353 --> 01:10:54.550
...that this is an essential
strategic operation.

01:10:54.723 --> 01:10:59.285
If they're giving aluminum to Boeing,
they can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

01:10:59.461 --> 01:11:02.430
Don't set the ice cream...

01:11:02.597 --> 01:11:06.966
We gotta think of something else. If we
can't get aluminum, we'll find another way.

01:11:07.402 --> 01:11:10.735
You tell me. We'll find
some alloy that works just as well.

01:11:11.006 --> 01:11:13.634
Right. Look...

01:11:13.809 --> 01:11:17.939
- lf we can't get aluminum, we'll use wood.
- You can't make a plane out of wood.

01:11:18.113 --> 01:11:20.638
Why not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

01:11:20.816 --> 01:11:22.784
- What do they use to make boats?
- Oak.

01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:25.886
And think of The Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

01:11:26.054 --> 01:11:28.852
Spanish galleons
can weigh 1200 tons.

01:11:29.724 --> 01:11:31.555
Good luck today.

01:11:32.093 --> 01:11:35.426
We just have to find the right wood.
Something light but strong.

01:11:35.597 --> 01:11:38.395
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.502
Catch.

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:56.213
From my farm.

01:11:56.785 --> 01:11:59.379
If you like it, I can get you a bushel.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.634
Trouble with Mr. Hughes?

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:24.478
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

01:12:26.314 --> 01:12:28.339
That's the trouble.

01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:43.293
Beautiful.

01:12:45.267 --> 01:12:46.666
Don't you take Christmas off?

01:12:48.003 --> 01:12:50.767
Nice to see you.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.

01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:53.464
Have we got something to show you.

01:12:57.846 --> 01:13:02.579
Take a look. The XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.

01:13:03.518 --> 01:13:06.214
Designed every inch of her myself.

01:13:06.388 --> 01:13:08.379
She's got a top speed of 450...

01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:11.389
...which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:14.653
After the Japs stole
my H-1 design for their Zeros...

01:13:14.829 --> 01:13:16.990
...I needed to do them one better.

01:13:18.099 --> 01:13:21.227
Yeah, she's my Buck Rogers ship.

01:13:21.403 --> 01:13:23.428
She's a looker.

01:13:24.072 --> 01:13:25.699
Okay, what do you got for me?

01:13:33.148 --> 01:13:35.378
Jiminy Cricket.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:39.213
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.

01:13:39.387 --> 01:13:42.754
Four Double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.

01:13:42.924 --> 01:13:46.155
- Gross weight?
- 86,000, wing loading of 41 pounds.

01:13:46.328 --> 01:13:49.126
So less drag on the plane in thinner air.

01:13:49.297 --> 01:13:52.755
So high-cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.

01:13:53.835 --> 01:13:57.396
Giving her a range of about 3000 miles.

01:13:58.573 --> 01:14:01.064
- Cross-country.
- Nonstop.

01:14:02.377 --> 01:14:03.935
Bob...

01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:07.275
...you know something?
You are a son of a bitch.

01:14:18.226 --> 01:14:21.718
Yeah. Bob, you got
something on your suit.

01:14:23.298 --> 01:14:24.765
Yeah.

01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:27.624
On your lapel.
You got something on your lapel.

01:14:30.772 --> 01:14:32.637
Right there, Bob.

01:14:34.409 --> 01:14:35.967
You missed it. Right there.

01:14:38.279 --> 01:14:40.144
Clean it off, would you?

01:14:40.315 --> 01:14:42.806
Here. Thanks.

01:14:46.087 --> 01:14:47.520
No, throw it away.

01:14:51.559 --> 01:14:52.958
No, over there.

01:14:59.467 --> 01:15:03.301
Thanks. So, what do you call her?

01:15:03.471 --> 01:15:05.632
The Constellation,
but we can change that.

01:15:05.807 --> 01:15:07.434
No, no.

01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:10.635
It's pretty. I like her.

01:15:11.613 --> 01:15:13.706
So, what kind of deal can you give me?

01:15:13.882 --> 01:15:15.679
What kind of deal can you give me?

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.148
The first 40 planes off the assembly line.

01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:20.844
That should give us about
two years' exclusivity.

01:15:21.022 --> 01:15:22.319
Hell, more than that.

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:26.483
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.

01:15:26.661 --> 01:15:29.255
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

01:15:34.302 --> 01:15:35.564
How much?

01:15:35.737 --> 01:15:37.898
Four hundred and fifty thousand each.

01:15:38.706 --> 01:15:41.573
So that's 18 million for the first 40.

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:45.570
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.

01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:52.219
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.

01:15:53.121 --> 01:15:56.181
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.

01:15:56.357 --> 01:15:57.881
Oh, and thank you.

01:16:01.663 --> 01:16:03.494
Merry Christmas.

01:16:03.665 --> 01:16:08.125
<i>You've just placed the largest order for</i>
<i>airplanes in the history of the damn planet.</i>

01:16:08.303 --> 01:16:10.430
<i>Lockheed sent us a bill for $18 million.</i>

01:16:10.605 --> 01:16:13.870
Don't get all hysterical on me, Noah.
It isn't good for you.

01:16:14.042 --> 01:16:17.375
<i>- This is a lot of money for planes.</i>
- I know it's a lot of money.

01:16:17.545 --> 01:16:21.174
<i>It's too damn much. You think I've got</i>
<i>$18 million in petty cash?</i>

01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:23.510
I should've told you. It slipped my mind.

01:16:23.685 --> 01:16:25.585
<i>- Slipped your mind? Oh, for...</i>
- Right.

01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:29.211
- I'll get back to you. Bye.
<i>- How could $18 million slip your mind?</i>

01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:33.254
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?

01:16:37.699 --> 01:16:40.532
You're not one for tears, and, well...

01:16:40.702 --> 01:16:44.968
...neither am I,
so it's best to come out with it.

01:16:48.076 --> 01:16:52.308
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:59.683
If I could make it
any more gentle, I would.

01:16:59.854 --> 01:17:03.915
But I can't, so...

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:06.859
...there we both are.

01:17:10.465 --> 01:17:12.296
Let's be honest.

01:17:12.467 --> 01:17:16.961
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.

01:17:17.138 --> 01:17:20.039
We're too alike, you and I.

01:17:23.178 --> 01:17:24.475
You met someone?

01:17:24.646 --> 01:17:28.582
Someone more appropriate.
To me, I mean.

01:17:31.286 --> 01:17:34.255
What does that mean,
"more appropriate"?

01:17:34.656 --> 01:17:38.752
Someone more attuned to my needs.

01:17:39.294 --> 01:17:41.228
Look at me, Katie.

01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:43.296
Stop acting.

01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:46.529
I'm not acting.

01:17:51.139 --> 01:17:53.767
I wonder if you even know anymore.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.910
Don't be unkind.

01:18:03.618 --> 01:18:05.313
You?

01:18:06.654 --> 01:18:07.985
You wanna go?

01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:13.253
Go on.

01:18:13.828 --> 01:18:16.956
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.

01:18:17.131 --> 01:18:19.725
- And I got a lot of money.
- This is beneath you.

01:18:19.901 --> 01:18:22.335
No, no, this is exactly me.

01:18:22.503 --> 01:18:27.634
You tell me you're leaving me, and you
have the nerve to expect graciousness?

01:18:28.109 --> 01:18:30.100
I expect a little maturity.

01:18:30.278 --> 01:18:33.179
I expect you to face the situation
like an adult who...

01:18:33.348 --> 01:18:35.646
Don't talk down to me!

01:18:35.817 --> 01:18:38.809
Don't you ever talk down to me!
You are a movie star.

01:18:38.987 --> 01:18:40.545
Nothing more.

01:19:52.593 --> 01:19:54.527
<i>Don't answer it.</i>

01:19:57.398 --> 01:19:59.093
What is it, Howard?

01:19:59.267 --> 01:20:01.565
<i>Hey, Noah...</i>

01:20:01.736 --> 01:20:04.728
...I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me some clothes.

01:20:04.906 --> 01:20:06.703
- Penney's isn't open.
- Oh, shit.

01:20:06.874 --> 01:20:09.809
- It's 2 in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:12.707
Well, first thing tomorrow, then, all right?

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.940
I need two new suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.

01:20:16.117 --> 01:20:19.348
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. Got that?

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.454
- Yeah.
- No, no.

01:20:21.622 --> 01:20:23.453
- Make it Woolworth's.
- Woolworth's.

01:20:23.624 --> 01:20:26.218
No, no, Penney's. Penney's.

01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:28.123
All right.

01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:31.628
I'll get into it as soon as I can, Howard.

01:20:31.966 --> 01:20:34.526
- All right?
- Noah, do you have a recorder?

01:20:35.236 --> 01:20:38.433
- No.
- Are you recording this conversation?

01:20:38.606 --> 01:20:41.006
- No.
- Okay.

01:20:41.175 --> 01:20:43.006
I trust you.

01:20:44.045 --> 01:20:47.412
- Howard...
- I need those suits first thing tomorrow.

01:20:47.582 --> 01:20:51.040
- All right.
- Wait. Did I say Penney's or Woolworth's?

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:53.847
- Penney's.
- Better make it Sears.

01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:56.512
All right, then, Sears.

01:20:59.394 --> 01:21:01.555
I'm sorry, honey.

01:21:02.764 --> 01:21:05.028
If I don't answer, he'll just call back.

01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:29.947
Stop there, if you please, Miss Domergue.

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:37.730
Have you had surgery, Miss Domergue?

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.067
No.

01:21:41.903 --> 01:21:44.997
Do you have scars of any kind?

01:21:46.407 --> 01:21:47.931
No.

01:21:49.577 --> 01:21:51.704
Wipe off your lipstick.

01:21:56.284 --> 01:21:57.546
That's much better.

01:21:59.153 --> 01:22:04.056
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me? Personally.

01:22:04.992 --> 01:22:07.119
Do you know what that means?

01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:17.233
Now turn around for me.

01:22:25.513 --> 01:22:27.003
Very nice.

01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:30.014
You move well.

01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:34.822
You live with your family, do you?

01:22:36.924 --> 01:22:38.516
Yes.

01:22:38.993 --> 01:22:40.517
That's nice.

01:22:41.863 --> 01:22:43.626
Tell me something.

01:22:44.999 --> 01:22:47.399
How old are you, Miss Domergue?

01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:52.134
Fifteen.

01:22:55.543 --> 01:22:56.703
Holy Mother of God.

01:23:16.129 --> 01:23:19.929
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at 8, and off I go.

01:23:20.099 --> 01:23:23.125
I'm getting my high school diploma.

01:23:23.303 --> 01:23:25.999
Howard thinks that education is important.

01:23:26.172 --> 01:23:28.572
- That's right.
- And then, after classes...

01:23:28.741 --> 01:23:32.302
...I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.

01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:34.275
Well, blow me down.

01:23:35.481 --> 01:23:37.711
Pan Am's working
out of the Cocoanut Grove?

01:23:37.884 --> 01:23:39.818
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.

01:23:39.986 --> 01:23:41.715
Helen, good to see you.

01:23:41.888 --> 01:23:44.379
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.

01:23:44.557 --> 01:23:46.354
- This is Faith Domergue.
- Sit down.

01:23:46.526 --> 01:23:48.391
- Pleasure.
- What are you doing here?

01:23:48.561 --> 01:23:51.359
Well, I'm out to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.

01:23:51.531 --> 01:23:55.399
It's our new plane, and it is
gonna be a pip, let me tell you.

01:23:55.568 --> 01:23:58.765
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.

01:23:59.072 --> 01:24:00.334
Great.

01:24:01.741 --> 01:24:04.232
So how about letting me steal a peek?

01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:08.180
I don't think so.

01:24:08.348 --> 01:24:11.374
I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.

01:24:12.185 --> 01:24:15.712
- He's doing our interior design. That's right.
- He was doing ours.

01:24:18.224 --> 01:24:19.987
So...

01:24:20.526 --> 01:24:22.994
...what are your colors?
- Stop fishing.

01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:27.222
So you have buttons...

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.833
...or zippers?

01:24:29.268 --> 01:24:30.530
I'm sorry?

01:24:32.472 --> 01:24:36.374
Buttons or zippers for the drapes
on the sleeping berths?

01:24:39.879 --> 01:24:41.540
Zippers.

01:24:50.456 --> 01:24:52.014
Buttons.

01:25:01.701 --> 01:25:04.693
So I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.

01:25:05.204 --> 01:25:08.731
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3000 miles.

01:25:08.908 --> 01:25:13.004
I'd imagine you'd expand from Los Angeles
to Mexico and South America.

01:25:13.179 --> 01:25:15.340
Hey, that's a good idea.
Anyone got a pen?

01:25:15.515 --> 01:25:17.642
Or across the Atlantic.

01:25:20.653 --> 01:25:22.553
You've had enough of this ice cream.

01:25:22.722 --> 01:25:26.283
You give me that spoon. You don't
wanna get your gloves all sticky.

01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:30.126
Isn't that too far?

01:25:35.168 --> 01:25:37.068
New York...

01:25:37.236 --> 01:25:39.261
...to Newfoundland...

01:25:39.972 --> 01:25:41.234
...to Ireland.

01:25:46.479 --> 01:25:48.071
To Paris.

01:25:55.221 --> 01:25:56.848
Well...

01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:59.483
...Pan Am welcomes you.

01:25:59.659 --> 01:26:01.490
We're overbooked as it is.

01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:05.290
It's such a burden doing it all
on your own, let me tell you.

01:26:05.465 --> 01:26:07.524
So when's the Connie gonna be ready?

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.328
- Next year maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.

01:26:10.503 --> 01:26:13.666
Well, we look forward to her then.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.969
And I to the Connie.

01:26:17.844 --> 01:26:21.473
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

01:26:21.714 --> 01:26:23.477
- It's Miss?
- Domergue.

01:26:23.649 --> 01:26:27.016
Yes, of course. Now, was that a
rumba or a samba you were doing?

01:26:27.453 --> 01:26:30.183
- It was a samba.
- A samba, yes.

01:26:30.356 --> 01:26:33.621
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.

01:26:34.594 --> 01:26:36.425
Helen, Jack.

01:26:38.264 --> 01:26:41.062
Good going. You gave away
our entire postwar strategy.

01:26:41.234 --> 01:26:45.694
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am. He can stop anything.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.537
Give me the largest
Scotch you got.

01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:53.304
I don't know what in the hell you're
so damn giddy about. Excuse me.

01:28:45.391 --> 01:28:46.824
Jack.

01:28:46.993 --> 01:28:50.622
Get in touch with Joyce and Berg.
Those are my boys in Washington.

01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:54.197
Set up a meeting with Jones,
secretary of commerce, old golfing buddy.

01:28:54.367 --> 01:28:57.302
- Slow down.
- We'll need terminals in Ireland and France.

01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:58.937
I wanna get some tax breaks.

01:28:59.105 --> 01:29:02.768
If that ass thinks he owns the world,
he's got another thing coming.

01:29:02.942 --> 01:29:05.809
Pan Am owns Europe.
We ought to think about Mexico.

01:29:05.978 --> 01:29:10.074
To hell with Mexico. No airline should
have a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.

01:29:10.249 --> 01:29:13.548
It just isn't fair.
He owns Pan Am, he owns Congress.

01:29:13.719 --> 01:29:17.553
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.

01:29:17.723 --> 01:29:20.351
We're in a street fight
with that son of a bitch.

01:29:20.526 --> 01:29:24.189
I've been fighting high-hat
Ivy League pricks like him my whole life.

01:29:24.363 --> 01:29:27.992
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.

01:29:28.167 --> 01:29:31.568
He's spying for Trippe.
That shitheel knew all about the buttons.

01:29:31.737 --> 01:29:33.705
Spies in my midst, Jack.

01:29:34.407 --> 01:29:36.204
Spies in my midst.

01:29:50.656 --> 01:29:53.557
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.

01:29:55.461 --> 01:29:57.019
So...

01:29:57.196 --> 01:29:58.720
...what can I do for you?

01:30:01.934 --> 01:30:05.927
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

01:30:06.105 --> 01:30:09.632
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.

01:30:09.809 --> 01:30:13.176
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.

01:30:13.346 --> 01:30:15.610
They're movie stars.
Fair game all around.

01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:26.251
My office knows where I am, Howard.

01:30:27.293 --> 01:30:30.091
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

01:30:30.262 --> 01:30:32.196
I don't do that.

01:30:36.936 --> 01:30:39.564
- How much?
- Not for sale.

01:30:42.842 --> 01:30:44.400
How much?

01:30:45.277 --> 01:30:48.440
Not for sale.

01:30:51.784 --> 01:30:53.877
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

01:30:55.688 --> 01:30:58.122
You ever screw a colored girl?

01:30:58.824 --> 01:31:01.987
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?

01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:05.961
Good night, Howard.

01:31:06.365 --> 01:31:09.334
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?

01:31:19.178 --> 01:31:21.305
TWA stock.

01:31:22.348 --> 01:31:23.610
How much?

01:31:25.217 --> 01:31:26.684
Fifty thousand shares.

01:31:27.319 --> 01:31:28.786
Ten.

01:31:31.857 --> 01:31:33.188
All right.

01:31:36.295 --> 01:31:38.126
This isn't gonna be that easy.

01:31:38.497 --> 01:31:41.898
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.

01:31:42.068 --> 01:31:45.504
And Jack Frye is out there
lobbying everybody in town.

01:31:45.671 --> 01:31:48.834
The French and British ambassadors
are lined up on his side.

01:31:50.176 --> 01:31:53.339
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.

01:31:53.512 --> 01:31:55.139
Okay.

01:31:55.314 --> 01:31:57.248
Point, Mr. Hughes.

01:31:57.616 --> 01:32:01.279
I think it's time for you to introduce
the community airline bill...

01:32:01.454 --> 01:32:02.978
...on the floor of the Senate.

01:32:03.989 --> 01:32:06.787
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.

01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:11.487
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defense.

01:32:13.933 --> 01:32:16.993
On the committee or chairman?

01:32:17.336 --> 01:32:19.998
I could be much more effective
as chairman.

01:32:20.172 --> 01:32:23.938
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:27.568
- Wasn't Truman chairman of that committee?
- Yeah, right.

01:32:27.746 --> 01:32:30.146
He's vice president.
Look what he did with it.

01:32:30.316 --> 01:32:32.375
No, I think...

01:32:33.085 --> 01:32:35.019
I think chairman.

01:32:35.688 --> 01:32:37.121
What do you think?

01:32:39.158 --> 01:32:41.718
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.

01:32:41.894 --> 01:32:45.386
Let me show you
these specs for the DC-4.

01:32:45.664 --> 01:32:49.122
Ava, what do you think about
Trans World Airlines?

01:32:49.301 --> 01:32:51.826
Transcontinental and Western
doesn't fit anymore.

01:32:52.004 --> 01:32:54.871
We're international,
we need a name that reflects that.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.736
Trans World is good. Kind of peppy.

01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:00.435
TWA, right?

01:33:00.613 --> 01:33:03.377
That way you don't need
to repaint any of the planes.

01:33:03.549 --> 01:33:05.710
That's you. Always pinching pennies.

01:33:06.886 --> 01:33:08.877
Hand me my wrap.

01:33:22.902 --> 01:33:25.063
Knock it off.

01:33:31.277 --> 01:33:33.802
I have something for you.

01:33:35.047 --> 01:33:36.878
Stay here.

01:33:42.354 --> 01:33:45.016
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.

01:33:45.191 --> 01:33:47.091
Go on, open it.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.718
Oh, a box of trash.
You shouldn't have.

01:33:51.897 --> 01:33:53.592
Keep looking, keep looking.

01:33:58.437 --> 01:34:00.496
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.

01:34:00.673 --> 01:34:03.801
I had my boys all over
the damn globe looking for this.

01:34:03.976 --> 01:34:05.238
Why?

01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:06.673
Because.

01:34:06.845 --> 01:34:08.472
Look.

01:34:08.647 --> 01:34:10.706
It matches your eyes.

01:34:10.883 --> 01:34:13.249
I am not for sale.

01:34:13.419 --> 01:34:15.478
For chrissakes, it's just a present.

01:34:15.654 --> 01:34:18.851
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.

01:34:19.024 --> 01:34:22.585
Don't buy me any more diamonds
or sapphires or any other damn thing.

01:34:22.761 --> 01:34:25.195
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

01:34:25.931 --> 01:34:27.193
Jesus, Ava.

01:34:28.234 --> 01:34:31.294
It's bad enough I have to endure
those gym shoes of yours.

01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:35.133
But I get all dolled up and we go out
in this jalopy without a hood.

01:34:36.575 --> 01:34:39.703
Ava, will you marry me?

01:34:39.878 --> 01:34:42.574
- No, Howard.
- Well, why not, for heaven's sake?

01:34:42.748 --> 01:34:45.308
In the first place, I don't love you.

01:34:45.484 --> 01:34:47.850
In the second place, I'm still married.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:52.719
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.

01:34:52.891 --> 01:34:54.825
Marry one of your bungalow girls.

01:34:54.994 --> 01:34:58.794
Those are employees. I won't marry
an employee. How would that look?

01:35:06.972 --> 01:35:08.234
What is going on?

01:35:11.543 --> 01:35:14.171
- Oh, my God!
- Goddamn it!

01:35:15.814 --> 01:35:17.076
Faith!

01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:19.784
- Faith, what the hell?
- Look out!

01:35:19.952 --> 01:35:22.648
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

01:35:25.824 --> 01:35:28.588
- Are you okay, lady?
- What are you doing with her?

01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:31.423
We are going to dinner.
Now, get out of there.

01:35:31.597 --> 01:35:33.588
Get that crazy bitch away from me!

01:35:33.766 --> 01:35:35.358
Don't you love me anymore?

01:35:35.534 --> 01:35:37.092
Course I love you, pork chop.

01:35:37.269 --> 01:35:39.032
Ava, look over here. Howard.

01:35:39.772 --> 01:35:41.034
Hey.

01:35:44.476 --> 01:35:47.104
<i>Juan Trippe is working</i>
<i>with Senator Brewster now.</i>

01:35:47.279 --> 01:35:51.613
They're after you. If the community
airline bill becomes law, we are finished.

01:35:51.784 --> 01:35:53.877
Pan Am will have a monopoly
on international travel.

01:35:54.053 --> 01:35:56.578
Well, how can they justify it?
It's un-American.

01:35:56.755 --> 01:36:00.589
Brewster is saying that nationalized
foreign carriers, like Air France...

01:36:00.759 --> 01:36:03.785
...can offer lower rates because
they don't have to compete.

01:36:03.962 --> 01:36:07.261
Let's get rid of competition
and have a nationalized airline...

01:36:07.433 --> 01:36:10.493
...and why don't we make it Pan Am?
- I'm not kowtowing to anyone.

01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:12.933
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.

01:36:13.105 --> 01:36:15.630
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?

01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:20.177
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.

01:36:20.346 --> 01:36:21.608
- Speak up.
- One cut.

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:25.944
I don't give a rat's ass. I'm not making
a cut. I'll release it without a seal.

01:36:26.118 --> 01:36:27.813
We gotta go public with this.

01:36:27.986 --> 01:36:29.851
I'm gonna talk to Hearst...

01:36:30.022 --> 01:36:33.185
...but we gotta get
some senators on our side.

01:36:33.359 --> 01:36:35.759
- What do you want me to do?
- What Trippe does.

01:36:35.928 --> 01:36:38.658
Offshore operations.
See who's up for re-election...

01:36:38.831 --> 01:36:41.425
...let's start making donations.
- Bribe senators?

01:36:41.867 --> 01:36:44.529
I don't want them bribed.
I want it done legally.

01:36:44.703 --> 01:36:48.036
I want them bought.
Put a team of investigators on Brewster.

01:36:48.207 --> 01:36:50.539
I need to know everything
about that shitbag.

01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:53.610
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.

01:36:53.779 --> 01:36:55.770
- Get into it right now.
- You got it.

01:37:03.422 --> 01:37:04.855
Just give me a second.

01:37:07.192 --> 01:37:10.184
- All right, what do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.

01:37:10.863 --> 01:37:12.922
No. These are fine.

01:37:13.098 --> 01:37:17.194
Have Simon and Pete get back to me on the
assemblies. We need a secondary system.

01:37:17.369 --> 01:37:18.859
Okay.

01:37:19.671 --> 01:37:22.367
Listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.

01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:25.339
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah.

01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:27.035
It just doesn't feel right.

01:37:27.212 --> 01:37:31.205
Christ almighty, you've seen 8000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.

01:37:31.383 --> 01:37:33.180
- Just one of them.
- I know, I know.

01:37:33.352 --> 01:37:35.718
- This one?
- I know, this one...

01:37:35.888 --> 01:37:39.722
This one's pretty close. Pretty close.

01:38:15.761 --> 01:38:17.251
Odie.

01:38:18.163 --> 01:38:20.688
That man sweeping up over there...

01:38:20.866 --> 01:38:23.926
...does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?

01:38:24.102 --> 01:38:26.662
Name's Nick, something like that.

01:38:28.907 --> 01:38:30.670
Why's he looking at me?

01:38:32.878 --> 01:38:34.311
I don't know.

01:38:36.415 --> 01:38:39.543
Fire him. And make sure
they use damp brooms from now on.

01:38:39.718 --> 01:38:43.085
Respiratory diseases are expensive,
and I don't want lawsuits.

01:38:43.255 --> 01:38:46.156
But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel?

01:38:46.325 --> 01:38:48.759
- The tool shop's ready.
- I wanna see the blueprints.

01:38:48.927 --> 01:38:51.896
Look, Howard, the deadline
is now completely unrealistic.

01:38:52.064 --> 01:38:54.589
The war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.

01:38:54.766 --> 01:38:58.964
I need you to help consult on vital decisions,
and you're off dealing with movies.

01:38:59.137 --> 01:39:02.106
You got 1000 workers waiting
for you to make a decision...

01:39:02.274 --> 01:39:03.901
Hey, Odie!

01:39:04.076 --> 01:39:06.067
Take it easy, all right.

01:39:06.245 --> 01:39:10.272
You're under pressure, but it's gonna
do me no good if you crack up on me.

01:39:10.983 --> 01:39:12.712
All right? Look...

01:39:12.885 --> 01:39:15.217
...take a couple of hours off, all right.

01:39:15.387 --> 01:39:17.252
- You just relax a little.
- Okay.

01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:19.714
- See your wife.
- Okay.

01:39:20.125 --> 01:39:21.490
All right.

01:39:22.361 --> 01:39:25.592
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.

01:39:27.232 --> 01:39:29.462
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:29.935 --> 01:39:31.926
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:32.104 --> 01:39:35.733
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:37.342 --> 01:39:38.969
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:39.144 --> 01:39:42.045
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:42.214 --> 01:39:44.148
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:44.316 --> 01:39:45.874
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:48.110
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:48.287 --> 01:39:50.380
I wanna get this done right.

01:39:51.156 --> 01:39:52.589
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:52.758 --> 01:39:54.487
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:57.254
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:57.429 --> 01:39:58.987
Show me all the blueprints.

01:39:59.164 --> 01:40:01.098
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

01:40:01.266 --> 01:40:04.929
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints...

01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:34.364
Quarantine.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.095
Q...

01:40:37.269 --> 01:40:39.237
...U...

01:40:39.404 --> 01:40:41.634
...A...

01:40:42.274 --> 01:40:44.242
...R...

01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:46.844

01:40:59.458 --> 01:41:01.483
...E.

01:41:04.396 --> 01:41:06.489
Quarantine.

01:41:44.503 --> 01:41:47.563
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.

01:41:47.739 --> 01:41:49.900
Odie, you reading me okay?

01:41:50.075 --> 01:41:51.303
Yeah, you're A-okay.

01:41:56.948 --> 01:42:00.145
<i>All right, flight controls are active.</i>
<i>She's all yours.</i>

01:42:09.061 --> 01:42:11.393
Spotless.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttle.

01:42:11.563 --> 01:42:13.394
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:42:30.415 --> 01:42:34.010
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.

01:42:34.186 --> 01:42:36.086
All right, make her sing.

01:42:56.975 --> 01:43:00.206
Well, Odie, she can fly. Congratulations.

01:43:00.378 --> 01:43:03.870
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear
and climb to 5000 feet...

01:43:04.049 --> 01:43:05.607
...on a heading of 2-7-0.

01:43:05.784 --> 01:43:11.654
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.

01:43:16.161 --> 01:43:18.356
- She's fast.
- What's your air speed?

01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:20.157
292.

01:43:20.365 --> 01:43:23.892
<i>- All right, take her back to 200.</i>
- No damn way.

01:43:49.694 --> 01:43:51.423
We gotta bring her home.

01:43:51.596 --> 01:43:54.030
<i>Scheduled time of one hour</i>
<i>and 45 minutes has elapsed.</i>

01:43:54.232 --> 01:43:57.167
<i>- Set course for 0-9-0...</i>
- Ten more minutes. Roger that.

01:43:57.335 --> 01:43:59.929
<i>Negative, Howard. Bring her home.</i>

01:44:00.105 --> 01:44:05.975
Okay. Okay. Setting course for 0-9-0.

01:44:06.678 --> 01:44:08.578
Preparing to descend.

01:44:12.217 --> 01:44:15.482
- Jesus.
<i>- What is it, Howard?</i>

01:44:16.788 --> 01:44:20.280
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.

01:44:20.725 --> 01:44:23.353
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

01:44:23.829 --> 01:44:25.057
Cutting back.

01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:27.364
Increasing starboard engine only.

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.230
Cutting back. I'm losing altitude.

01:44:31.403 --> 01:44:33.963
Check starboard-engine manifold pressure.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.708
- It's good, but rpm's are low.
<i>- Are both starboard props turning?</i>

01:44:38.877 --> 01:44:40.344
Hold on.

01:44:40.579 --> 01:44:43.605
They are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.

01:44:43.782 --> 01:44:46.376
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder...

01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.850
...and full left aileron,
but she won't stay level. Goddamn it.

01:44:50.121 --> 01:44:52.988
- Give us your position.
- Two thousand feet over...

01:44:53.158 --> 01:44:57.219
Oh, Christ, I don't know, Beverly Hills.
Fifteen hundred feet.

01:44:57.395 --> 01:44:59.090
We're going down.

01:45:00.031 --> 01:45:03.626
I'll try for the Wilshire Country Club.
Ninth hole. You reading me?

01:45:03.802 --> 01:45:07.738
<i>Wilshire Country Club, copy that.</i>
<i>Howard, reduce engines to 1000.</i>

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.400
I'm going down!
I'm not gonna make it, buddy!

01:45:19.885 --> 01:45:21.682
Goddamn it!

01:47:24.042 --> 01:47:27.534
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?!

01:47:27.712 --> 01:47:29.407
No.

01:47:33.251 --> 01:47:36.618
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

01:47:45.897 --> 01:47:48.593
- every inch of his
wiring and fluid connection.

01:47:48.767 --> 01:47:51.429
He has burns to 78 percent of his body.

01:47:51.603 --> 01:47:54.265
Nine ribs are shattered,
not broken, shattered...

01:47:54.773 --> 01:47:59.233
...as are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.

01:47:59.411 --> 01:48:02.005
He has 60 lacerations
on his face, to the bone.

01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:05.344
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung collapsed...

01:48:05.517 --> 01:48:09.180
...and his heart has shifted
to the right side of his chest cavity.

01:48:10.121 --> 01:48:12.021
Jesus, God.

01:48:12.457 --> 01:48:16.791
- He's getting blood transfusions now, but...
- Whose blood?

01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:19.790
- I'm sorry?
- Whose blood?

01:48:20.298 --> 01:48:21.856
From our stock.

01:48:22.534 --> 01:48:26.698
- Oh, he's not going to like that.
- Mr. Dietrich, I doubt he's...

01:48:26.871 --> 01:48:29.806
...ever gonna like or
dislike anything again.

01:48:30.442 --> 01:48:32.603
I'm terribly sorry.

01:49:01.072 --> 01:49:02.972
<i>Orange juice.</i>

01:49:06.077 --> 01:49:09.513
It's not fresh from the kitchen, so I...

01:49:10.215 --> 01:49:15.312
I have them make it here so...
So I can see.

01:49:19.424 --> 01:49:21.358
Look at me.

01:49:23.995 --> 01:49:25.986
I'm a monster.

01:49:26.464 --> 01:49:31.265
Yeah. Orange juice has nutritional value.

01:49:32.437 --> 01:49:37.397
There's... There's some flies
outside my window, though.

01:49:37.976 --> 01:49:39.739
So...

01:49:41.779 --> 01:49:44.441
...little Howard likes...

01:49:45.917 --> 01:49:48.044
...citrus.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.685
Don't he just?

01:49:53.825 --> 01:49:55.520
Tell me.

01:49:57.162 --> 01:50:00.962
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.

01:50:01.132 --> 01:50:04.590
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.

01:50:05.103 --> 01:50:06.866
Do you understand me?

01:50:07.405 --> 01:50:12.399
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.

01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:15.540
- You following me?
- Yeah.

01:50:16.748 --> 01:50:20.411
The Air Force canceled the contract
on The Hercules.

01:50:22.754 --> 01:50:28.158
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it anymore.

01:50:28.626 --> 01:50:33.086
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?

01:50:33.264 --> 01:50:35.357
How far...

01:50:37.168 --> 01:50:38.601
...from finishing?

01:50:39.837 --> 01:50:44.638
- About six months.
- No, in money.

01:50:47.912 --> 01:50:49.777
Seven million.

01:50:50.582 --> 01:50:51.947
Maybe more.

01:50:57.355 --> 01:50:59.186
Build it.

01:51:00.692 --> 01:51:02.626
Build it, Odie.

01:51:04.462 --> 01:51:05.986
Howard...

01:51:06.631 --> 01:51:10.692
...a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.

01:51:11.169 --> 01:51:14.605
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.

01:51:24.582 --> 01:51:26.243
You know...

01:51:27.318 --> 01:51:30.583
...Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:34.485
Take a look.

01:51:38.263 --> 01:51:43.132
- What did you do with all the others?
- Oh, I had them taken out.

01:51:43.301 --> 01:51:46.464
They... They attract aphids.

01:51:47.505 --> 01:51:52.204
Aphids are...
They're just awful little creatures.

01:51:53.077 --> 01:51:54.840
But...

01:51:57.181 --> 01:51:59.274
But these ones...

01:52:00.251 --> 01:52:04.119
...I wanted to see these ones every day.

01:52:11.663 --> 01:52:14.655
<i>Can white elephants fly?</i>
<i>That's everybody's question.</i>

01:52:14.832 --> 01:52:19.860
<i>The hull of the world's mightiest airplane,</i>
<i>a flying boat built by Howard Hughes.</i>

01:52:20.038 --> 01:52:24.202
<i>Two hundred and twenty feet long,</i>
<i>it towers higher than a five-story building.</i>

01:52:24.375 --> 01:52:28.368
<i>Power lines have to be cut as it starts</i>
<i>the trip from Culver City...</i>

01:52:28.546 --> 01:52:30.571
<i>... to the Pacific, 30 miles away.</i>

01:52:30.748 --> 01:52:33.979
<i>Moving the 60-ton load</i>
<i>is quite an engineering problem.</i>

01:52:34.152 --> 01:52:38.111
<i>But you gotta ask, was anything this big</i>
<i>ever supposed to fly?</i>

01:52:38.289 --> 01:52:42.783
<i>There goes one wing section,</i>
<i>160 feet long with four engine housings.</i>

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.827
<i>Double that and you've got some idea</i>
<i>of the wingspread.</i>

01:52:45.997 --> 01:52:50.297
<i>An airplane that challenges</i>
<i>a mountain for sheer size.</i>

01:52:57.308 --> 01:52:59.538
How long can they keep us grounded?

01:52:59.711 --> 01:53:03.272
Until they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.

01:53:03.448 --> 01:53:08.385
You're running a $14 million deficit. How
will you afford to keep them out of service?

01:53:08.586 --> 01:53:13.080
- We go international, we'll make it up.
- Brewster's C.A.B. bill isn't going away.

01:53:13.257 --> 01:53:15.987
That bill passes,
and you bought these for nothing.

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:19.561
- We're fighting the C.A.B. bill.
- Meanwhile, how do we keep TWA flying?

01:53:19.731 --> 01:53:24.327
Don't say, "Just go to Tool Co." We're
pumping every cent into The Hercules...

01:53:24.502 --> 01:53:27.300
...which the Air Force
doesn't even want anymore.

01:53:27.472 --> 01:53:31.238
I'm glad Jack is feeling sunny about things,
but I've seen the books.

01:53:31.576 --> 01:53:34.010
I'm telling it straight. I'm not crying wolf.

01:53:34.178 --> 01:53:37.272
We're in serious trouble.
You've gotta make a choice.

01:53:37.448 --> 01:53:42.511
You wanna be bankrupted
by the big plane or by the big airline?

01:53:49.827 --> 01:53:53.422
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.

01:53:53.598 --> 01:53:57.159
Get a loan against
all the TWA equipment and capital.

01:53:57.335 --> 01:54:03.171
Use the planes as collateral. Hell, use the
desks, use the pens, use everything we got.

01:54:03.341 --> 01:54:07.505
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?

01:54:08.112 --> 01:54:11.013
Then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

01:54:13.618 --> 01:54:16.712
Under my bed! You put a goddamn
microphone under my bed!

01:54:16.888 --> 01:54:19.015
Listen to me.
I am concerned about you.

01:54:19.190 --> 01:54:22.557
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- And who is in that car?!

01:54:22.894 --> 01:54:25.055
It's been with me 24 hours a day.

01:54:25.229 --> 01:54:26.992
That car is for your protection!

01:54:27.165 --> 01:54:30.623
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard!

01:54:30.802 --> 01:54:32.326
You don't own me, Howard.

01:54:32.503 --> 01:54:35.631
I'm not one of your teenage whores
or some damn airplane.

01:54:35.807 --> 01:54:37.832
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

01:54:38.009 --> 01:54:40.034
I need to know where you are.

01:54:40.211 --> 01:54:42.873
- Why?!
- Because I worry about you, that's why.

01:54:43.047 --> 01:54:45.038
Bullshit!

01:54:47.552 --> 01:54:49.645
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

01:54:55.726 --> 01:54:58.354
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

01:55:00.665 --> 01:55:02.656
There's more.

01:55:02.934 --> 01:55:04.731
How many?

01:55:05.036 --> 01:55:11.202
I don't know, 12.
Twelve, maybe, and on the telephones.

01:55:11.676 --> 01:55:15.339
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

01:55:15.513 --> 01:55:17.105
You listen to my phone calls?

01:55:17.281 --> 01:55:21.081
No, no, honey, I would never do that.
I'd never do that.

01:55:21.252 --> 01:55:24.278
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

01:55:28.893 --> 01:55:31.020
What do you wanna know, Howard?

01:55:31.195 --> 01:55:33.356
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:36.227
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.994
Everyone said you were a lunatic,
I didn't listen.

01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.071
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass!

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:44.708
Shut your goddamn mouth.

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.316
Get out, you pathetic freak.

01:55:59.724 --> 01:56:01.885
Get out!

01:56:02.059 --> 01:56:03.720
Is everything all right, sir?

01:56:03.895 --> 01:56:06.227
Take out all the bugs, huh?

01:56:08.366 --> 01:56:10.459
Except for the one
on the bedroom phone.

01:56:10.635 --> 01:56:12.432
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

01:56:14.272 --> 01:56:18.868
This is outrageous! Everything here is the
private property of Hughes Productions.

01:56:19.043 --> 01:56:21.739
- My legal counsel is on the way...
- Federal warrant.

01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:24.177
Don't interfere with the search, sir.

01:56:43.868 --> 01:56:47.360
<i>Dateline: Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Howard Hughes has a new houseguest.</i>

01:56:47.538 --> 01:56:51.133
<i>No, it's not another beautiful starlet.</i>
<i>This time it's the FBI.</i>

01:56:51.309 --> 01:56:55.211
<i>Noah, you've got to help. This is</i>
<i>the 10th time they have been here.</i>

01:56:55.379 --> 01:56:58.837
<i>Rumor has it that agents</i>
<i>working for Senator Owen Brewster...</i>

01:56:59.016 --> 01:57:02.850
<i>... have practically taken up residence</i>
<i>in the aviation mogul's home.</i>

01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.113
Look, I mean, they are touching things.

01:57:05.456 --> 01:57:08.584
- Noah, they are touching things.
<i>- Just keep yourself calm...</i>

01:57:08.759 --> 01:57:11.785
<i>... and I'll be down there</i>
<i>as soon as I can, Howard.</i>

01:57:11.963 --> 01:57:13.658
<i>Howard?</i>

01:57:13.831 --> 01:57:15.662
<i>Howard?</i>

01:57:40.024 --> 01:57:41.924
Howard, hello.

01:57:42.093 --> 01:57:45.426
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.

01:57:45.596 --> 01:57:48.121
- Emma, you can start up lunch now.
- Yes, sir.

01:57:48.299 --> 01:57:52.793
Well, really lovely room.
It's nicely decorated.

01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:54.733
Thank you. Here, have a seat.

01:57:54.905 --> 01:57:56.338
Thanks for coming by.

01:57:56.507 --> 01:57:59.635
I thought you and I
should have a chance to talk privately.

01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:01.573
You know, outside the office.

01:58:03.581 --> 01:58:04.912
Well...

01:58:05.449 --> 01:58:07.417
...I appreciate that, Owen.

01:58:14.825 --> 01:58:19.853
So you're coming out pretty strong
against the C.A.B. bill.

01:58:20.598 --> 01:58:25.695
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard, you know.

01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:30.102
Look, I believe sincerely
that America cannot afford...

01:58:30.274 --> 01:58:33.107
...to have more than one
international carrier.

01:58:34.679 --> 01:58:39.844
I mean, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on international..?

01:58:40.017 --> 01:58:43.384
A monopoly? No, no, no. Oh, no.

01:58:43.554 --> 01:58:48.617
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.

01:58:48.993 --> 01:58:53.623
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.

01:58:53.998 --> 01:58:56.933
That's just beautiful. What is that?

01:59:01.138 --> 01:59:03.436
What is that? Is that a?

01:59:03.607 --> 01:59:05.507
Is that a yak?

01:59:05.676 --> 01:59:08.406
- Some kind of a yak?
- No, that's a llama.

01:59:08.579 --> 01:59:10.843
My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru.

01:59:11.015 --> 01:59:13.074
Son of a gun.

01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:15.741
A real llama.

01:59:17.054 --> 01:59:20.683
- From Peru?
- Yeah. From a year ago, I think it was...

01:59:20.858 --> 01:59:24.055
- Yeah, it was about a year ago.
- Lunch is served, senator.

01:59:24.228 --> 01:59:26.719
Good. Okay.
Come on, let's go have some lunch.

01:59:28.299 --> 01:59:32.292
Now, did you..?
Did you actually get to see any llamas?

01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:34.938
No, no. My wife just liked the painting.

01:59:35.106 --> 01:59:38.166
It's an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.

01:59:38.342 --> 01:59:42.779
How do you spell that?
Like? Like Fernando Lamas?

01:59:43.147 --> 01:59:47.413
No, no. It's...
It's the animal, it's got two L's.

01:59:47.585 --> 01:59:49.610
Here, come on, have a seat.

01:59:58.763 --> 02:00:01.231
It's brook trout. Hope you like fish.

02:00:03.768 --> 02:00:07.397
I love it. Thanks.

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:26.750
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope... Hope water's okay.

02:00:39.637 --> 02:00:41.229
Thanks.

02:00:47.178 --> 02:00:50.579
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.

02:00:51.448 --> 02:00:53.780
My investigators...

02:00:54.518 --> 02:00:57.351
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.

02:00:57.822 --> 02:01:01.155
It could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.

02:01:01.859 --> 02:01:04.384
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.

02:01:05.663 --> 02:01:07.790
That's very kind of you, Owen.

02:01:10.801 --> 02:01:14.635
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.

02:01:16.207 --> 02:01:18.107
I'd like to spare you that.

02:01:18.809 --> 02:01:20.037
Would you, now?

02:01:21.378 --> 02:01:22.902
Look...

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.779
Do you wanna go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?

02:01:27.952 --> 02:01:29.214
Is that what you want?

02:01:31.722 --> 02:01:33.952
What do you want, Owen?

02:01:35.526 --> 02:01:41.624
You agree to support my C.A.B. bill,
and I won't hold public hearings.

02:01:41.799 --> 02:01:43.528
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

02:01:43.701 --> 02:01:47.296
I can't do that, Owen.
The C.A.B. would kill TWA.

02:01:47.471 --> 02:01:50.599
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

02:01:51.242 --> 02:01:54.370
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price.

02:01:55.446 --> 02:01:57.641
And then..? Then you won't go public?

02:01:57.815 --> 02:02:02.650
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.

02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:05.846
That's... It's better for everybody.

02:02:10.527 --> 02:02:14.054
You know, Owen,
I'm still wondering one thing.

02:02:14.231 --> 02:02:17.928
- What's that?
- The picture of the llama you got last year?

02:02:18.102 --> 02:02:20.764
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?

02:02:21.472 --> 02:02:23.497
We didn't sail. We flew.

02:02:24.875 --> 02:02:27.002
- You flew?
- Yeah.

02:02:34.818 --> 02:02:38.083
Are you sure you want to do this, Owen?

02:02:38.856 --> 02:02:41.290
You want to go to war with me?

02:02:46.096 --> 02:02:50.430
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.

02:02:51.402 --> 02:02:53.962
We just beat Germany and Japan.

02:02:54.538 --> 02:02:56.563
Who the hell are you?

02:03:01.812 --> 02:03:06.511
You... You tell Juan Trippe
something for me, all right?

02:03:07.151 --> 02:03:09.915
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

02:03:10.287 --> 02:03:15.520
And he can kiss both sides of my ass.

02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:42.018
<i>Well, we have a long list of particulars.</i>

02:03:42.186 --> 02:03:46.350
Chief among them is that he defrauded
the American government...

02:03:46.523 --> 02:03:50.084
...of $56 million while at war,
when we could least afford it.

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.286
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy...

02:03:53.464 --> 02:03:56.900
...Mr. Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.

02:03:57.067 --> 02:03:58.398
I sleep...

02:03:59.203 --> 02:04:01.467
...in this room...

02:04:03.207 --> 02:04:04.606
...in the dark.

02:04:04.775 --> 02:04:07.676
I'll have him dragged here to Washington
if I have to.

02:04:07.845 --> 02:04:10.075
I wanna see the whites of his lies.

02:04:10.347 --> 02:04:12.372
I have a place.

02:04:13.150 --> 02:04:16.779
- I can sleep.
<i>- He has a lot of questions to answer.</i>

02:04:16.954 --> 02:04:20.014
- I have a chair.
- Particularly about that monstrous...

02:04:20.190 --> 02:04:24.650
...boondoggle of his,
that model airplane he's building...

02:04:24.828 --> 02:04:29.424
...that flying lumberyard,
that spruce goose.

02:04:31.068 --> 02:04:33.434
<i>No, he'll... We'll get him here.</i>

02:04:37.007 --> 02:04:38.440
That's just beautiful.

02:04:39.443 --> 02:04:43.038
Oh, yeah. I like the desert.

02:04:44.948 --> 02:04:48.714
It's hot there in the desert,
but it's clean.

02:04:49.286 --> 02:04:50.947
It's clean.

02:04:52.689 --> 02:04:54.623
I need to sleep.

02:04:57.528 --> 02:04:59.826
I should drink something first.

02:05:04.401 --> 02:05:06.164
I should drink something first.

02:05:10.874 --> 02:05:12.603
Wait a minute.

02:05:13.977 --> 02:05:15.501
What if that milk is sour?

02:05:16.747 --> 02:05:18.374
That milk is bad.

02:05:19.116 --> 02:05:24.076
I shouldn't pick up
the bottle of milk with my right hand.

02:05:24.488 --> 02:05:30.757
And I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand...

02:05:31.728 --> 02:05:34.856
...put it in my pocket.

02:05:35.032 --> 02:05:37.626
My left pocket.

02:05:54.418 --> 02:05:58.684
Howard, it's Kate.
I need... I need to talk to you.

02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:01.858
Can you hear me?

02:06:04.328 --> 02:06:06.319
I'm coming in.

02:06:11.168 --> 02:06:13.898
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

02:06:22.446 --> 02:06:24.846
I can't, sweetie.

02:06:27.751 --> 02:06:29.651
You mean you won't.

02:06:31.522 --> 02:06:34.958
Howard, please let me see you.

02:06:35.125 --> 02:06:40.290
- I haven't shaved.
- Well, neither have I.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.331
Come on.

02:06:45.502 --> 02:06:47.197
You...

02:06:47.371 --> 02:06:49.839
You let me in.

02:06:55.546 --> 02:06:57.912
I can hear you, Katie.

02:06:59.383 --> 02:07:04.878
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.

02:07:05.556 --> 02:07:08.957
That's because I'm so goddamn loud.

02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:15.664
Howard, I...

02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:20.134
I came to thank you.

02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:24.202
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.

02:07:24.374 --> 02:07:27.639
Buying those awful pictures.

02:07:32.282 --> 02:07:33.943
You love him.

02:07:40.691 --> 02:07:43.319
He's everything I have.

02:07:51.368 --> 02:07:53.393
Howard?

02:07:54.371 --> 02:07:56.805
I'm glad for you, Kate.

02:07:58.141 --> 02:08:00.575
Go away now. Would you do that?

02:08:01.979 --> 02:08:05.244
- Howard, please.
- Go away.

02:08:05.415 --> 02:08:08.816
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

02:08:08.986 --> 02:08:11.386
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.

02:08:11.555 --> 02:08:14.422
Yes, please. You take me flying again.

02:08:14.591 --> 02:08:17.424
Howard, I can take the wheel.

02:08:23.267 --> 02:08:24.859
Howard?

02:08:31.341 --> 02:08:33.400
Howard, are you..? Are you there?

02:08:39.116 --> 02:08:40.777
Howard?

02:08:42.586 --> 02:08:44.451
Howard, are you there?

02:08:46.923 --> 02:08:48.948
Come on, Howard.

02:08:51.895 --> 02:08:53.829
Howard, are you there?

02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:22.183
Come in with the milk.

02:09:22.359 --> 02:09:24.520
Come in with the milk.

02:09:24.695 --> 02:09:27.027
Come in with the milk.

02:09:27.331 --> 02:09:30.357
He is to open the bag
with his right hand...

02:09:30.534 --> 02:09:33.628
...and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle...

02:09:33.804 --> 02:09:37.137
...so I may reach into the bag without...

02:09:39.176 --> 02:09:41.406
Without touching the paper.

02:09:46.416 --> 02:09:48.475
Repeated from the beginning.

02:09:49.019 --> 02:09:51.214
Repeated from the beginning.

02:09:51.955 --> 02:09:54.048
Repeated from the beginning.

02:10:04.468 --> 02:10:08.837
<i>If there is any variation</i>
<i>of these instructions...</i>

02:10:09.005 --> 02:10:12.338
<i>... even to the smallest degree...</i>

02:10:12.509 --> 02:10:16.707
<i>... the entire process must be repeated...</i>

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:19.314
<i>- ... from the beginning.</i>

02:10:19.483 --> 02:10:22.247
<i>- Repeated from the beginning.</i>
- Come in with the milk.

02:10:22.419 --> 02:10:24.182
- Come in with the milk.
<i>- Repeated...</i>

02:10:24.354 --> 02:10:26.083
<i>... from the beginning.</i>

02:10:26.256 --> 02:10:28.224
<i>Repeated from the beginning.</i>

02:10:28.392 --> 02:10:30.087
Come in with the milk.

02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:32.160
Q...

02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:35.292
R...

02:10:35.665 --> 02:10:37.758

02:10:39.269 --> 02:10:40.827
T...

02:10:41.238 --> 02:10:43.729
Q...

02:10:44.574 --> 02:10:46.769
...U...

02:10:48.345 --> 02:10:50.279

02:10:51.415 --> 02:10:53.542

T...

02:10:56.887 --> 02:10:58.752

02:10:58.989 --> 02:11:00.786
...N...

02:11:01.758 --> 02:11:03.817
...E.

N...

02:11:07.397 --> 02:11:08.762
...E.

02:11:08.932 --> 02:11:11.025
E...

02:11:11.201 --> 02:11:13.169
I...

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:25.543
Howard?

02:11:27.751 --> 02:11:29.275
Hello?

02:11:31.655 --> 02:11:33.020
Who is it?

02:11:33.190 --> 02:11:35.181
Howard, it's Juan.

02:11:43.667 --> 02:11:45.601
Juan.

02:11:46.169 --> 02:11:48.433
Juan, right. Yeah.

02:11:48.605 --> 02:11:51.369
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

02:11:52.042 --> 02:11:54.510
I remember that. Look...

02:11:54.678 --> 02:11:57.476
...I got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.

02:11:57.647 --> 02:12:01.048
So take a seat out there,
because I don't wanna get you sick.

02:12:01.518 --> 02:12:06.615
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't wanna get you sick. I don't wanna...

02:12:13.763 --> 02:12:15.594
Thank you.

02:12:18.201 --> 02:12:19.964
Okay, Howard, I'm sitting.

02:12:20.637 --> 02:12:23.697
I've brought along our accountings.
Now...

02:12:23.874 --> 02:12:27.037
...Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.

02:12:27.210 --> 02:12:29.838
TWA at four and a quarter.

02:12:30.013 --> 02:12:31.480
- Now, if you take...
- Come on.

02:12:31.648 --> 02:12:36.915
Come on, come on, come on.
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.

02:12:37.087 --> 02:12:39.146
Besides, you couldn't afford her.

02:12:39.322 --> 02:12:43.088
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.

02:12:43.693 --> 02:12:46.924
Well, considering our stock is trading
at three times yours...

02:12:47.097 --> 02:12:50.123
...I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.699
What I...

02:12:53.837 --> 02:12:58.399
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?

02:12:58.575 --> 02:13:00.702
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.

02:13:00.877 --> 02:13:03.573
I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.

02:13:03.747 --> 02:13:05.612
Here's the point.

02:13:05.782 --> 02:13:08.250
Owen Brewster works for you.

02:13:08.818 --> 02:13:14.654
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.

02:13:22.332 --> 02:13:27.793
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.

02:13:27.971 --> 02:13:29.996
Real nasty for all of us.

02:13:30.173 --> 02:13:34.542
Well, I think,
considerably more so for you.

02:13:34.945 --> 02:13:38.142
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio...

02:13:38.315 --> 02:13:42.046
...you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.

02:13:42.218 --> 02:13:44.778
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

02:13:44.955 --> 02:13:48.755
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.

02:13:48.925 --> 02:13:53.225
I wish you were up there with me, Juan.
It was exhilarating.

02:13:54.164 --> 02:13:57.565
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.

02:13:58.301 --> 02:14:00.769
It's called The Hercules!

02:14:00.937 --> 02:14:04.168
And it will fly, goddamn it!

02:14:04.341 --> 02:14:08.402
I hope so. The American people deserve
something for their $13 million.

02:14:08.578 --> 02:14:11.570
I won't sell TWA!

02:14:11.748 --> 02:14:12.874
I won't!

02:14:17.887 --> 02:14:19.878
I know that, Howard.

02:14:20.690 --> 02:14:22.385
I know that.

02:14:24.194 --> 02:14:26.822
But I'm going to get it anyway.

02:14:27.797 --> 02:14:31.665
You will default on your loan from
Equitable after Senator Brewster...

02:14:31.835 --> 02:14:36.135
...destroys your reputation and you can't
find additional capital for the airline.

02:14:36.306 --> 02:14:41.505
The hearings will also show Hughes Aircraft
to be mismanaged and incompetent...

02:14:41.678 --> 02:14:43.737
...and it will go bankrupt too.

02:14:43.913 --> 02:14:47.474
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Tool Co.

02:14:47.651 --> 02:14:51.485
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.

02:14:51.721 --> 02:14:53.848
I rather hope you do.

02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:57.623
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA...

02:14:57.794 --> 02:15:01.821
...and painted all those magnificent
Connies blue and white.

02:15:01.998 --> 02:15:06.867
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.

02:15:10.306 --> 02:15:11.967
Well...

02:15:13.943 --> 02:15:17.037
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.

02:15:18.048 --> 02:15:21.211
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.

02:15:22.786 --> 02:15:26.688
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.

02:15:27.791 --> 02:15:30.123
Very public, Howard.

02:15:32.128 --> 02:15:35.564
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

02:15:35.799 --> 02:15:39.565
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.

02:15:41.438 --> 02:15:44.601
Perhaps we should spare you that.

02:15:46.509 --> 02:15:51.446
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

02:15:51.614 --> 02:15:53.605
I find that...

02:15:54.751 --> 02:15:56.912
...very moving.

02:15:57.687 --> 02:15:59.678
It's been a real pleasure.

02:16:01.324 --> 02:16:04.418
Noah will see you back
to the airport now.

02:16:05.428 --> 02:16:06.793
You fly safe.

02:16:10.567 --> 02:16:12.831
You fly safe.

02:16:17.774 --> 02:16:20.504
Thank you, Howard,
and you take care of that cold.

02:16:20.677 --> 02:16:22.611
Don't you worry.

02:16:22.779 --> 02:16:24.940
I certainly will.

02:16:25.882 --> 02:16:27.611
Bye-bye.

02:16:32.288 --> 02:16:37.055
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.

02:16:37.227 --> 02:16:40.128
People should remember him as he was.

02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:48.793
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.

02:16:50.073 --> 02:16:52.633
If you can get him out of there by then.

02:17:42.458 --> 02:17:44.289
Mr. Hughes?

02:17:50.366 --> 02:17:52.698
I don't have any shoes.

02:17:54.537 --> 02:17:57.404
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.

02:17:58.174 --> 02:17:59.698
Yeah.

02:18:25.101 --> 02:18:27.728
How nice of you to dress for me.

02:18:30.974 --> 02:18:33.101
Can I come in?

02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:38.279
Yeah, you can come in.

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:47.089
Thank you for coming.

02:18:59.502 --> 02:19:01.561
Now, let's get a drink.

02:19:01.737 --> 02:19:05.868
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You're safe here.

02:19:06.041 --> 02:19:09.136
You're in the germ-free zone now.
You understand?

02:19:09.312 --> 02:19:14.772
- I'll take my chances.
- No, no, honey. Wait, wait.

02:19:27.897 --> 02:19:30.297
Love what you've done with the place.

02:19:37.106 --> 02:19:41.166
Now, let me look at you.

02:19:45.882 --> 02:19:48.316
When do you go to Washington?

02:19:48.818 --> 02:19:50.718
A week.

02:19:50.887 --> 02:19:53.788
No, no. Just under a week.

02:19:53.957 --> 02:19:58.417
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be...

02:19:58.594 --> 02:20:01.154
All right, take it easy.

02:20:14.110 --> 02:20:16.772
There's nothing there, Howard.

02:20:23.686 --> 02:20:27.087
I see things.

02:20:27.957 --> 02:20:29.857
I know, baby.

02:20:30.994 --> 02:20:33.360
Rinse your face off, now.

02:20:42.271 --> 02:20:44.762
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.

02:20:44.941 --> 02:20:48.206
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

02:20:52.648 --> 02:20:56.084
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.

02:20:56.252 --> 02:20:59.244
But we do our best, right?

02:20:59.989 --> 02:21:01.718
Yeah.

02:21:21.077 --> 02:21:22.772
What do you think?

02:21:22.945 --> 02:21:26.381
- Well, I look all right.
- You look great.

02:21:26.549 --> 02:21:28.210
Will you marry me?

02:21:28.384 --> 02:21:31.080
You're too crazy for me.

02:21:32.722 --> 02:21:35.088
I gotta go, baby.

02:21:35.825 --> 02:21:37.656
Okay.

02:21:38.394 --> 02:21:40.089
Thanks.

02:21:46.035 --> 02:21:48.265
You'd do it for me.

02:21:54.644 --> 02:21:56.612
Hi, Howard. How you doing?

02:22:37.386 --> 02:22:39.752
The committee will come to order.

02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:45.122
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that
we maintain quiet during these proceedings.

02:22:45.294 --> 02:22:48.525
All right, Mr. Hughes,
will you stand and be sworn?

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:54.527
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee...

02:22:54.704 --> 02:22:58.834
...you will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

02:22:59.008 --> 02:23:01.238
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly...

02:23:01.410 --> 02:23:05.676
...but I know you have difficulty hearing.
- That's quite all right.

02:23:05.982 --> 02:23:09.543
I mean, everybody knows I'm deaf.
I'm not gonna try to hide it.

02:23:11.954 --> 02:23:14.616
Mr. Hughes, it is the intention
of this committee...

02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:16.348
Mr. Hughes has a statement.

02:23:17.693 --> 02:23:23.598
All right, you may proceed
with this statement, Mr. Hughes.

02:23:29.906 --> 02:23:32.204
Mr. Hughes, do you have a statement?

02:23:39.549 --> 02:23:43.815
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

02:23:44.554 --> 02:23:49.548
I mean, my reputation's being destroyed,
so I might as well lay the cards on the table.

02:23:50.393 --> 02:23:54.454
Senator Brewster, if you hadn't
gone too far overboard...

02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:57.292
...if you hadn't put
the red-hot iron in my side...

02:23:57.466 --> 02:24:01.994
...I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.

02:24:02.171 --> 02:24:07.734
I may have been willing to sit back and take
a certain amount of abuse simply because...

02:24:08.477 --> 02:24:11.071
...well, I am only a private citizen.

02:24:11.247 --> 02:24:13.340
Whereas you are a senator...

02:24:13.516 --> 02:24:16.417
...with all sorts of powers.

02:24:17.253 --> 02:24:20.188
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough!

02:24:20.356 --> 02:24:24.224
- That's quite sufficient.
- You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.

02:24:24.393 --> 02:24:27.419
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer!

02:24:27.597 --> 02:24:31.556
- The witness will restrain...
- Why not tell the truth for once, senator?

02:24:31.734 --> 02:24:36.194
Why not tell the truth that this investigation
was really born on the day that TWA...

02:24:36.372 --> 02:24:41.935
...decided to fly to Europe? On the day that
TWA first invaded Juan Trippe's territory!

02:24:42.111 --> 02:24:44.636
- Sit down.
- On the day TWA first challenged...

02:24:44.814 --> 02:24:49.376
...the generally accepted theory that only
Juan Trippe's great Pan American Airways...

02:24:49.552 --> 02:24:53.648
...had the right to fly the Atlantic!
- You are not here to make a speech.

02:24:54.657 --> 02:24:58.115
I asked for silence!
I asked for quiet in this room...

02:24:58.294 --> 02:25:02.321
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000...

02:25:03.666 --> 02:25:07.966
...acquired from Mr. John Meyer.
Mr. Meyer works for you, does he not?

02:25:08.137 --> 02:25:12.301
- He does.
- And what is his official title?

02:25:13.209 --> 02:25:16.770
I don't exactly know, senator.
A lot of people work for me.

02:25:16.946 --> 02:25:19.744
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out...

02:25:19.915 --> 02:25:24.909
...more than $170,000 to representatives
of the United States Air Force?

02:25:25.087 --> 02:25:29.524
- I don't know. You'd have to ask him.
- Well, would you produce him?

02:25:30.426 --> 02:25:33.589
- Produce him?
- Will you cause him to appear?

02:25:33.763 --> 02:25:36.994
You had John Meyer on the stand
for three days last week.

02:25:37.166 --> 02:25:39.930
Be that as it may,
we would like him to reappear.

02:25:40.102 --> 02:25:43.560
Would you ask him to return?

02:25:49.578 --> 02:25:51.842
No, I don't think I will.

02:25:53.482 --> 02:25:56.679
Will you try to have him return?

02:25:58.754 --> 02:26:03.214
- No, I don't think I'll try.
- You don't think you'll try?

02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:07.285
No, I don't think so.

02:26:07.463 --> 02:26:12.264
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites...

02:26:12.435 --> 02:26:14.062
...TWA stock...

02:26:14.737 --> 02:26:17.205
...female companionship.

02:26:17.406 --> 02:26:21.706
Now, is it possible that
these could be considered bribes?

02:26:22.378 --> 02:26:24.710
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

02:26:26.082 --> 02:26:27.447
Would you repeat that?

02:26:28.417 --> 02:26:32.251
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.

02:26:34.890 --> 02:26:37.723
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr. Hughes?

02:26:39.428 --> 02:26:43.626
I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, senator.

02:26:43.799 --> 02:26:48.236
See, wining and dining Air Force dignitaries
is common in our business.

02:26:48.404 --> 02:26:53.341
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.

02:26:53.509 --> 02:26:55.670
I don't know whether
it's a good system...

02:26:55.845 --> 02:27:00.077
...I just know it's not illegal.
You, senator, you are the lawmaker.

02:27:00.249 --> 02:27:04.845
If you pass a law that states no one
can entertain Air Force officers, well, hell...

02:27:05.020 --> 02:27:07.181
...I'd be happy to abide by it.

02:27:09.258 --> 02:27:12.694
Your story is a pack of lies. I can
tear it apart if allowed to cross-examine.

02:27:14.029 --> 02:27:18.295
- We're not gonna have this bickering.
- Yes. Somewhere between two and 500...

02:27:18.467 --> 02:27:22.335
...if you'll let me get started.
- lf you believe your wealth and power...

02:27:22.505 --> 02:27:26.464
...can intimidate any member
of this committee, you're mistaken.

02:27:26.642 --> 02:27:29.543
- Now submit your questions.
- I'll put this very simply.

02:27:29.712 --> 02:27:32.738
On February 12th,
at the Mayflower Hotel...

02:27:32.915 --> 02:27:38.512
...did you or did you not tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am...

02:27:38.687 --> 02:27:41.485
...that this entire investigation
would be called off?

02:27:41.657 --> 02:27:45.388
I did not. And I have asked you
to submit your questions in writing.

02:27:45.561 --> 02:27:49.497
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known him for some time now.

02:27:49.665 --> 02:27:54.398
- And that's not the question.
- Is it not true that Juan donated $20,000...

02:27:54.570 --> 02:27:58.802
...to your last campaign? I mean,
he spoke to me as if you worked for him.

02:28:02.845 --> 02:28:04.710
I have a personal friendship with...

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:08.316
Is it true you accept free Pan Am tickets
to circle the globe...

02:28:08.484 --> 02:28:11.419
...in support of your C.A.B. bill?
- No, it is not true.

02:28:11.587 --> 02:28:15.785
Well, who wrote that bill, senator?
Who actually wrote the C.A.B. bill?

02:28:15.958 --> 02:28:19.894
- The actual words. Did you write them?
- This is not how these hearings...

02:28:20.062 --> 02:28:24.158
...are gonna be conducted.
- I have it. Maybe it'll refresh your memory.

02:28:24.333 --> 02:28:28.895
"Bill S-987 to amend
the Civil Aeronautics Act."

02:28:29.071 --> 02:28:31.904
Now, you introduced this bill
to the Senate.

02:28:34.376 --> 02:28:36.503
A lot of words.

02:28:36.846 --> 02:28:38.837
You write all of them?

02:28:39.448 --> 02:28:42.315
- Did you write any of them, senator?
- Now, look...

02:28:42.485 --> 02:28:45.477
Now, this entire bill was written
by Pan Am executives...

02:28:45.654 --> 02:28:49.920
...and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.

02:28:50.092 --> 02:28:54.552
You've been flogging this bill all around
the world on their behalf, have you not?

02:28:54.730 --> 02:28:58.496
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr. Hughes.

02:28:58.667 --> 02:29:03.695
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:09.104
I was seeking outlets for our trade goods.

02:29:10.079 --> 02:29:13.048
Buy a lot of lobsters down there, do they?

02:29:15.618 --> 02:29:19.418
Senator, how many times have you visited
Trippe's office in New York...

02:29:19.588 --> 02:29:21.954
...in the last three months?

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:27.324
Would you like me to tell you, senator?

02:29:28.063 --> 02:29:31.521
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan is a great American.

02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:36.069
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation for decades.

02:29:36.238 --> 02:29:41.767
Juan Trippe is a patriot. Juan Trippe is not
a man who is interested in making money.

02:29:42.678 --> 02:29:46.444
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
would be happy to hear that.

02:29:48.117 --> 02:29:49.607
We're gonna clear this room.

02:29:50.185 --> 02:29:54.952
<i>This is James McNamara speaking to you</i>
<i>from the Hughes 2000-ton flying boat...</i>

02:29:55.124 --> 02:29:58.287
<i>... the world's largest aircraft.</i>
<i>This is the sky giant...</i>

02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:02.556
<i>... which has prompted Congress to</i>
<i>investigate the war contracts of Mr. Hughes.</i>

02:30:02.731 --> 02:30:06.292
<i>Before boarding the craft,</i>
<i>Mr. Hughes told newsmen that this test...</i>

02:30:06.468 --> 02:30:10.700
<i>... would be solely a taxi experiment.</i>
<i>He said he didn't know what might happen.</i>

02:30:10.873 --> 02:30:12.738
<i>The mammoth flying plywood shell...</i>

02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:18.576
<i>... might ship water under high-speed</i>
<i>taxi pressure. He will not take...</i>

02:30:18.747 --> 02:30:22.046
<i>... the craft into the air until next spring.</i>
<i>The thin man from Culver City...</i>

02:30:22.217 --> 02:30:26.677
<i>... pronounced the craft an unknown quantity.</i>
<i>He has an idea what it can do...</i>

02:30:26.855 --> 02:30:28.880
None of that, now. None of that.

02:30:29.058 --> 02:30:31.959
<i>We are about 5 feet</i>
<i>in back of Mr. Hughes.</i>

02:30:32.127 --> 02:30:35.494
<i>We are looking through</i>
<i>one of the side windows in the cockpit.</i>

02:30:35.664 --> 02:30:38.224
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here.

02:30:38.634 --> 02:30:41.899
<i>In other words, we are 30 feet high</i>
<i>in this aircraft.</i>

02:30:42.071 --> 02:30:46.667
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.

02:30:47.676 --> 02:30:50.941
<i>Huge crowds jam the surrounding</i>
<i>shoreline this morning.</i>

02:30:51.113 --> 02:30:54.310
All right, boys, let's fire it up.

02:30:58.187 --> 02:30:59.552
One's good.

02:31:00.823 --> 02:31:02.791
Two's good.

02:31:02.958 --> 02:31:04.653
Three's good.

02:31:04.827 --> 02:31:06.852
Four's good.

02:31:07.029 --> 02:31:08.724
Five's good.

02:31:08.897 --> 02:31:10.387
Six is good.

02:31:10.566 --> 02:31:11.931
Seven's good.

02:31:12.101 --> 02:31:14.001
Eight's good.

02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:18.938
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.

02:31:20.542 --> 02:31:23.238
<i>As you probably know,</i>
<i>I have to do a great deal...</i>

02:31:23.412 --> 02:31:25.539
<i>... of screaming into our microphone.</i>

02:31:25.714 --> 02:31:30.117
- Understood. Lower it 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.

02:31:30.753 --> 02:31:34.519
Howard, she's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.

02:31:34.690 --> 02:31:36.954
Yeah, I know. I know.

02:31:37.126 --> 02:31:41.426
<i>It's a beautiful day here off the coast</i>
<i>of Southern California. Blue skies...</i>

02:31:41.597 --> 02:31:45.089
<i>- ... a warm sun...</i>
- Twenty-five miles per hour.

02:31:45.267 --> 02:31:47.531
<i>- And a relatively calm sea...</i>
- Thirty.

02:31:49.171 --> 02:31:50.468
Thirty-five.

02:31:50.639 --> 02:31:54.575
<i>One would think these eight power plants</i>
<i>might shake the craft to pieces...</i>

02:31:54.943 --> 02:31:56.535
Take it easy, Howard.

02:31:58.847 --> 02:32:02.613
- Forty!
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

02:32:02.785 --> 02:32:05.151
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

02:32:10.392 --> 02:32:12.883
<i>The flight crew itself</i>
<i>consists of four men.</i>

02:32:13.062 --> 02:32:17.089
<i>Mr. Hughes, however, has added 11</i>
<i>maintenance men to this maiden taxi test...</i>

02:32:17.266 --> 02:32:22.898
<i>... stationed at various places throughout the</i>
<i>ship, checking points of stress and strain.</i>

02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:27.001
How does she sound, Odie?

02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:29.901
Sounds good, Howard.

02:32:33.215 --> 02:32:35.342
- Professor.
- Yes?

02:32:35.517 --> 02:32:37.417
Would you do me a favor?

02:32:37.886 --> 02:32:41.913
Would you take a look out that window
and tell me what the wind is doing?

02:32:46.962 --> 02:32:51.296
I would say that we have a 15-knot wind.

02:32:51.467 --> 02:32:54.868
Would you call that a headwind,
professor?

02:32:55.571 --> 02:32:57.766
I would, Mr. Hughes.

02:32:57.940 --> 02:33:01.501
<i>We must maintain silence. We must</i>
<i>have quiet during the proceedings.</i>

02:33:01.677 --> 02:33:04.043
Mr. Hughes, will you stand and be sworn?

02:33:04.213 --> 02:33:06.647
<i>Mr. Hughes, did you receive...</i>

02:33:06.815 --> 02:33:13.186
...$43 million to manufacture 100 XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?

02:33:14.456 --> 02:33:15.616
I did.

02:33:15.924 --> 02:33:20.054
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?

02:33:20.362 --> 02:33:21.351
None.

02:33:21.530 --> 02:33:24.795
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphones, sir?

02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:26.460
None.

02:33:26.635 --> 02:33:30.537
Did you receive $13 million
to manufacture...

02:33:30.706 --> 02:33:35.507
...a prototype of a flying boat
known as The Hercules?

02:33:37.079 --> 02:33:38.341
I did.

02:33:38.514 --> 02:33:41.108
And did you deliver that plane?

02:33:41.416 --> 02:33:42.678
I did not.

02:33:43.786 --> 02:33:47.051
So by your admission
in this chamber, Mr. Hughes...

02:33:47.222 --> 02:33:50.157
...you have received $56 million...

02:33:50.526 --> 02:33:54.758
...from the United States government
for planes you never delivered.

02:33:55.597 --> 02:33:57.360
That is correct.

02:33:59.802 --> 02:34:02.794
Well, excuse me for asking,
Mr. Hughes...

02:34:02.971 --> 02:34:04.905
...but where did all that money go?

02:34:05.307 --> 02:34:09.835
Well, it went into the planes, senator.
And a lot more.

02:34:10.012 --> 02:34:14.813
More? Do tell, Mr. Hughes,
what other larcenies did you commit?

02:34:15.017 --> 02:34:20.284
I mean, I put my money
into the planes, senator. My money.

02:34:22.758 --> 02:34:27.320
- See, the thing is that I care...
- Your personal finances are not...

02:34:27.496 --> 02:34:30.192
Let him speak.

02:34:33.535 --> 02:34:34.866
Proceed, Mr. Hughes.

02:34:36.972 --> 02:34:42.274
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.

02:34:42.544 --> 02:34:47.208
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.

02:34:47.382 --> 02:34:51.785
And I've lost millions, senator,
and I'll go on losing millions. It's just...

02:34:51.954 --> 02:34:53.888
...what I do.

02:34:54.223 --> 02:34:58.557
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war, I hope folks...

02:34:58.727 --> 02:35:01.321
...will put that into perspective.

02:35:01.496 --> 02:35:04.829
More than 60 other airplanes ordered
from such firms as...

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.959
...Lockheed, Douglas, Northrop and Boeing
never saw action either.

02:35:09.137 --> 02:35:15.633
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.

02:35:15.811 --> 02:35:20.942
Over 6 billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.

02:35:21.116 --> 02:35:25.576
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million...

02:35:25.754 --> 02:35:28.245
...is the only firm
under investigation here.

02:35:28.423 --> 02:35:33.986
I cannot help but think that has a little more
to do with TWA than planes that did not fly.

02:35:34.196 --> 02:35:38.132
- You've made your point, Mr. Hughes.
- One second. I have one more thing...

02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:40.764
...to say here to this committee.

02:35:40.936 --> 02:35:43.461
And that has to do with The Hercules.

02:35:44.106 --> 02:35:49.339
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.

02:35:49.511 --> 02:35:51.570
I am supposed to be capricious.

02:35:51.747 --> 02:35:55.706
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric...

02:35:55.884 --> 02:36:00.116
...but I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.

02:36:01.089 --> 02:36:04.456
Needless to say, The Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.

02:36:04.626 --> 02:36:07.322
It is the largest plane ever built.

02:36:07.496 --> 02:36:11.364
It is over five stories tall with a wingspan
longer than a football field.

02:36:11.533 --> 02:36:13.398
That's more than a city block.

02:36:13.568 --> 02:36:18.096
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this.
I got my reputation all rolled up in it.

02:36:18.273 --> 02:36:21.731
I have stated several times
that if The Hercules fails to fly...

02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:26.006
...I will leave this country
and never come back. And I mean it.

02:36:27.382 --> 02:36:31.216
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me...

02:36:31.386 --> 02:36:36.221
...you can arrest me, you can even claim
I've folded up and taken a run-out powder...

02:36:36.391 --> 02:36:41.385
...but, well, I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.

02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:43.058
I had to do it.

02:36:43.265 --> 02:36:47.201
- Mr. Hughes.
- Mr. Hughes.

02:36:47.369 --> 02:36:49.929
I'd love to see The Hercules in the air.

02:36:50.105 --> 02:36:52.505
Thank you, thank you so much.

02:37:01.516 --> 02:37:02.574
Switch it off.

02:37:02.751 --> 02:37:05.584
- The hearings aren't over yet.
- The hearings are over.

02:37:08.323 --> 02:37:11.156
The airline bill will be defeated
in the Senate.

02:37:11.326 --> 02:37:14.386
TWA will begin flights from
New York to Paris...

02:37:14.563 --> 02:37:20.365
...then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles...

02:37:22.504 --> 02:37:24.529
...to New York.

02:37:28.377 --> 02:37:30.038
Fuck.

02:37:34.082 --> 02:37:37.916
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.

02:37:41.223 --> 02:37:43.487
<i>Howard Hughes has just alerted us.</i>

02:37:43.658 --> 02:37:48.220
<i>He has asked everyone to hold on.</i>
<i>Tremendous horsepower kicking up.</i>

02:37:49.798 --> 02:37:50.924
Let me hear it, Odie.

02:37:51.099 --> 02:37:53.124
Twenty-five miles per hour.

02:37:53.735 --> 02:37:54.963
Thirty.

02:37:55.303 --> 02:37:57.533
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

02:37:57.706 --> 02:37:59.867
- Thirty-five.
<i>- The air-speed indicator...</i>

02:38:00.042 --> 02:38:03.671
<i>... has moved up to 25. Thirty.</i>

02:38:04.079 --> 02:38:06.138
<i>- Thirty-five.</i>
- Forty.

02:38:06.314 --> 02:38:08.145
<i>As he pushes the throttle it's 40.</i>

02:38:08.316 --> 02:38:11.615
- Forty-five.
<i>- Forty-five. More throttle.</i>

02:38:11.787 --> 02:38:13.778
<i>- Forty-five.</i>
- Fifty.

02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:16.857
<i>- It's 50 over a choppy sea.</i>
- Fifty-five.

02:38:17.025 --> 02:38:19.357
<i>It's 55. It's 55.</i>

02:38:19.828 --> 02:38:22.023
- Sixty.
<i>- More throttle. It's 60.</i>

02:38:22.197 --> 02:38:23.926
- Sixty-five.
<i>- Sixty-five.</i>

02:38:28.603 --> 02:38:30.537
- Seventy.
<i>- It's 70.</i>

02:38:30.705 --> 02:38:33.435
- Seventy-five.
<i>- It's 75.</i>

02:38:40.816 --> 02:38:46.118
<i>And something momentarily cuts out.</i>
<i>I believe we are airborne.</i>

02:38:46.288 --> 02:38:49.883
<i>We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>I don't believe that Hughes...</i>

02:38:50.058 --> 02:38:52.788
<i>... meant this to be. I don't know.</i>

02:38:54.996 --> 02:39:00.400
<i>And we were really up in the air.</i>
<i>We were really up in the air.</i>

02:39:04.806 --> 02:39:08.207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Hughes mammoth aircraft...</i>

02:39:08.376 --> 02:39:12.904
<i>... has flown this afternoon</i>
<i>in Los Angeles Harbor.</i>

02:39:13.081 --> 02:39:17.279
<i>Well, it certainly looks at this moment</i>
<i>that Howard Hughes will be around...</i>

02:39:17.452 --> 02:39:21.320
<i>... the United States for quite</i>
<i>some time to come.</i>

02:39:32.367 --> 02:39:36.394
We must understand that technologies
like these are the way of the future.

02:39:36.571 --> 02:39:40.132
- That's enough questions.
- TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted...

02:39:40.308 --> 02:39:43.573
...to have you come here
and witness this wonderful sight.

02:39:43.745 --> 02:39:45.940
- Excuse us for just a second.
- All right.

02:39:46.114 --> 02:39:48.105
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?

02:39:48.283 --> 02:39:50.274
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.

02:39:50.452 --> 02:39:53.888
I thought I might pilot the first one.
Ought to be some fun.

02:39:54.055 --> 02:39:56.785
- Lots of shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything.

02:39:56.958 --> 02:39:59.859
You can buy me dinner. How about that?

02:40:02.130 --> 02:40:04.530
Dinner, then. We got a date?

02:40:04.733 --> 02:40:07.065
Okay, baby, you got a date.

02:40:08.703 --> 02:40:12.503
I'll be back in a second,
but don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.

02:40:12.674 --> 02:40:15.666
All right, listen, boys.
Something new. Jet airplanes.

02:40:15.844 --> 02:40:18.779
- You know about jets?
- No, but it sounds expensive.

02:40:18.947 --> 02:40:21.381
Oh, it will be, but we gotta get started.

02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:25.415
Come on, walk with me.

02:40:25.587 --> 02:40:27.919
Whoever can start utilizing
jet technology...

02:40:28.089 --> 02:40:31.957
...on commercial airliners is gonna win.
What do you know about the science?

02:40:32.127 --> 02:40:36.587
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.

02:40:41.236 --> 02:40:45.070
Noah, who are those fellas?

02:40:45.974 --> 02:40:47.771
Do they work for me?

02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:51.408
Everybody works for you, Howard.

02:40:58.186 --> 02:41:02.885
Lockheed worked on the F-80. Let's get
Bob Gross and see if he can help us out.

02:41:03.058 --> 02:41:05.356
- What, now?
- Of course now.

02:41:05.527 --> 02:41:08.462
We gotta get into it.
Jets are the way of the future.

02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:11.861
- It's 4:30.
- I talked to Bob last week. He's in New York.

02:41:12.033 --> 02:41:14.627
- So it's 7:30.
- He won't be in the office.

02:41:14.803 --> 02:41:18.000
We'll figure out what hotel he's at.
Do you want a call...

02:41:18.173 --> 02:41:21.665
...or you want some kind of meeting?
- We want a meeting, don't we?

02:41:21.843 --> 02:41:25.108
Do you want me bring him
out here tomorrow, then, Howard?

02:41:26.114 --> 02:41:28.514
- The way of the future.
- Howard?

02:41:28.683 --> 02:41:30.446
- Howard?
- The way of the future.

02:41:31.953 --> 02:41:34.683
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.

02:41:34.856 --> 02:41:36.790
- Way of the future.
- Give me a hand.

02:41:36.958 --> 02:41:40.394
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:40.562 --> 02:41:42.996
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:43.164 --> 02:41:45.724
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:48.368
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:48.536 --> 02:41:51.004
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:51.172 --> 02:41:53.538
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:41:53.708 --> 02:41:57.667
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
You understand, Howard?

02:41:57.846 --> 02:41:59.609
The way of the future.

02:41:59.781 --> 02:42:03.410
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.

02:42:03.585 --> 02:42:06.145
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:42:06.321 --> 02:42:09.188
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:42:09.357 --> 02:42:11.723
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

02:42:15.864 --> 02:42:17.661
The way of the future.

02:42:23.905 --> 02:42:25.964
<i>You are not safe.</i>

02:42:34.482 --> 02:42:35.710
<i>When I grow up...</i>

02:42:36.284 --> 02:42:39.253
<i>... I'm gonna fly the fastest planes</i>
<i>ever built...</i>

02:42:39.421 --> 02:42:42.015
<i>... make the biggest movies ever...</i>

02:42:42.190 --> 02:42:45.091
<i>... and be the richest man in the world.</i>

02:42:58.373 --> 02:43:01.342
The way of the future.

02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:11.212
The way of the future.

02:43:18.827 --> 02:43:21.022
The way of the future.

02:43:24.099 --> 02:43:26.192
The way of the future.

02:43:28.036 --> 02:43:30.266
The way of the future.

02:43:31.573 --> 02:43:33.131
The way of the future.

02:43:39.573 --> 02:43:45.573
