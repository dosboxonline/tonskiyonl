WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.462
[laughing]

00:04.546 --> 00:07.507
Oh. Hello there. You're probably
wondering what we're doing.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.093
Short answer, saving the earth again.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.886
You know,
with all the problems in the world,

00:11.970 --> 00:14.597
some people think
environmental work isn't important.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.016
We disagree.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.435
And when our help is needed
to get a baby gorilla

00:18.518 --> 00:20.812
back to her habitat
in the African mountains,

00:20.895 --> 00:25.692
well, to us, to this anti-poaching squad,
and to our agency,

00:25.775 --> 00:28.194
it's the most important thing
in the world.

00:28.278 --> 00:32.866
-Then we pan to the baby gorilla.
-Tiny hand just reaching out of the cage.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.744
-Like she's reaching out to us.
-It's cynical.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.203
-Empty.
-[both] But effective!

00:37.287 --> 00:39.581
-Just like your agency.
-I know, right?

00:39.664 --> 00:42.834
But beyond the obvious pandering,
why do you even need this?

00:42.917 --> 00:45.628
Isn't the spy thing meant to be a secret?

00:45.712 --> 00:48.423
Who am I to say we shouldn't tell everyone
the awesome things we do?

00:48.506 --> 00:51.259
-We are not telling everyone.
-Shouldn't we, though?

00:51.342 --> 00:54.429
The photos and videos
will only be uploaded to Global Spy Wire.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.724
Great branding, and it'll show
a softer side to your agency.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.017
-So soft.
-Baby soft.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.685
Enchiladas-in-your-shoe soft.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.479
Tamales-in-your-<i>zapato</i> soft.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.523
-Are you as hungry as I am?
-Uh, hungrier.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.692
Good to know that capitalism
is alive and well.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.110
Hey, if it helps us get business

01:09.194 --> 01:11.780
and we're helping the environment,
it's a win-win, right?

01:11.863 --> 01:14.449
Don't you think you should help
just for the environment,

01:14.532 --> 01:16.117
not for the publicity?

01:16.201 --> 01:19.579
Um, not when I'm this great on camera.
Who ever said acting was hard?

01:19.662 --> 01:20.747
-No one.
-Nobody?

01:20.830 --> 01:23.374
-Nobody.
-Really? I'm sure it was someone.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.918
Voltaire, maybe?

01:25.001 --> 01:26.336
That sounds right.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.879
Well, he was an idiot.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.002
[Alton] Yes, yes, exactly, yes.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.631
I guess I should thank you guys
for coming on such short notice.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.925
Honestly, it's nice
to be out of the house.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.553
-Robert's been a little, um--
-Let's not get off topic.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.221
We might need a couple more takes.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.266
Which would be Lana's fault,
since I'm pretty sure I nailed it.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.894
-We want you to highlight the brand.
-For a clear corporate identity.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.980
-Whether that's B2B.
-B2C.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.440
-Bea Arthur.
-BRB. Ha!

02:29.524 --> 02:31.025
You are nailing this.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.486
Does that mean say the name of the agency?

02:33.570 --> 02:36.698
-Jesus, was a marketing degree worth that?
-It was, and it wasn't.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.118
-So did we finally pick a name?
-Better. We have tons of options.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.036
Wait. Where are my suggestions?

02:42.120 --> 02:45.290
Like Archer's Angels? Fun-dercover?
Those were gold.

02:45.373 --> 02:49.377
Yeah. Maybe we'll revisit this
in a more positive headspace.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.005
-Great. Then if you're done--
-And what about Spy-cial?

02:52.088 --> 02:53.256
You can't say no.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.426
No. Look, your job here
is pretty straightforward.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.846
This squad saved
that baby gorilla from poachers.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.807
Oh, man. Do not let me look
at that baby gorilla in the eyes.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.350
Oh, not this again.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.186
Lana, you're just jealous
that my soul lovingly connects

03:07.270 --> 03:10.815
to the pure animals of the world,
but yours makes them hate you.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.859
Hey. That is not true.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.444
-Hey, buddy, come on.
-[gorilla whimpers]

03:14.527 --> 03:16.446
You don't need
to take care of the gorilla.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.991
Just help safely get everyone to
the mountain pass where their habitat is.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.368
Everyone meaning us,
the anti-poaching squad,

03:22.452 --> 03:24.621
the baby gorilla,
and the CloudBeam Marketers?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.748
Oh, no, we won't be joining you. Too busy.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.293
Turns out central Africa
has several exclusive resorts.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.921
-Which means room service.
-Spa service.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.006
[both] Stealing cotton robes!

03:35.089 --> 03:37.675
So, Sandra, we're leaving you
in charge of the camera.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.179
Oh, hard pass.
I am here to act as the UN liaison.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.807
Then you can liaise
the camera into your hands.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.269
Lana, you might want to use this time
to reconnect with your roots.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.938
-Uh, what?
-Africa.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.314
It is your birthright.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.442
Since Africa is nothing
like Berkeley, where I'm from,

03:54.525 --> 03:56.402
it's really not.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.280
As the liaison, are you in charge
of the anti-poaching squad?

03:59.364 --> 04:00.823
In charge of them?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.784
That is such a colonial mindset.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.161
Actually, I am in charge.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.915
-Wow. What is her story?
-That's Neva.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.751
She leads the anti-poaching squad's
rescue missions

04:11.834 --> 04:15.922
and is responsible for saving
over two dozen endangered species.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.090
He meant, is she single?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.425
I appreciate you helping
with the expedition.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.511
We may be quietly judging your photos,

04:21.594 --> 04:23.596
but we'll tolerate them since your agency…

04:23.680 --> 04:24.681
Spy-cial.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.183
…made a sizable contribution to us.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.395
This won't be an easy trip,
so we need all the help we can get.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.982
We'll take the Land Rovers to the river,
then canoe to the base of the mountain.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.651
Then we'll hike
to the Cross River gorilla refuge.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.321
It's a very rare breed,
but vital to the mountain's ecosystem.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.700
Because they help seed disbursement,
which affects tree growth.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.743
-I studied environmental science.
-So did I.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.370
-Me too.
-[chuckles] Nerd burn.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.290
Look, take your photos,
but do not get in the way.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.041
Of course. We understand that.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.003
Unrelated, maybe Neva
and I should get some photos

04:55.086 --> 04:57.505
of the two of us while we're here,
because, you know--

04:57.588 --> 04:59.173
Or we stay focused.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.592
My crew knows this terrain. You do not.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.430
And since medevacs are expensive,
keep an eye out for dangers.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.266
-Snakes, hippos, crocodiles.
-Crocodiles?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.352
You had to know there'd be
wild animals in the wild.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.064
Crocodiles aren't animals.
They're prehistoric underwater dinosaurs.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.693
-But, luckily, I brought some friends.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.279
-You cannot bring those with us.
-What?

05:21.362 --> 05:23.072
It's literally a jungle out there.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.450
The UN mandate said no guns.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.076
-There was a mandate for this?
-Yeah.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.705
It also included working
with an all-female anti-poaching squad.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.583
The UN found when they give
the expedition money to men,

05:33.666 --> 05:36.836
-they spend it on booze and whores.
-[Archer drinking]

05:36.919 --> 05:39.422
[sighs] Like the UN knows anything.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.967
And, by the way, we say "sex workers" now.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.343
Geezy Petes.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.721
Is there anything you won't do for money?

05:46.804 --> 05:50.725
As part of our rebranding,
we can charge more for our services

05:50.808 --> 05:53.436
if we do an environmental upgrade.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.148
There are really basic qualifications
we should have already been following.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.232
Nevertheless.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.235
This says we've been dumping
our waste into local parks!

06:01.319 --> 06:02.570
Nevertheless!

06:02.653 --> 06:06.657
The money we get isn't nearly as much
as the upgrade cost.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.118
So, instead, Dr. Krieger designed

06:09.202 --> 06:13.539
environmentally friendly
smart light bulbs and thermostats.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.959
I call it Cerebrus.
Totally different from Cerebro.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.545
Is Krieger the best idea for this?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.631
Since he'll do it for free, yes.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.509
Doesn't it seem way more likely
that Cerberus is--

06:24.592 --> 06:26.677
It's pronounced Cerebrus.

06:26.761 --> 06:31.099
It seems more likely Cerebrus
will be something creepy.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.227
-Oh, don't be so paranoid.
-Let me give you a demonstration.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.648
[female voice] <i>Hello.</i>
<i>I'm the Cerebrus thermostat.</i>

06:38.731 --> 06:41.067
<i>It is my pleasure</i>
<i>to control your temperature.</i>

06:41.150 --> 06:43.361
See? There's nothing weird about that.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.738
<i>I exist solely for your pleasure.</i>

06:45.822 --> 06:47.990
And this seems normal.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.992
Normally I do all the work around here,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.787
but now you'll be doing that
or just doing whatever I say.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.664
Ooh! Who's the fresh meat?

06:54.747 --> 06:57.333
She's not here for you.
She's the new intern I hired.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.584
[laughing] Oh, man.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.921
Ms. Archer's gonna be pissed if
you hired somebody else she's gotta pay.

07:02.004 --> 07:05.133
That's what's great about interns.
We don't have to pay them anything.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.717
How's that going for you, kid?

07:06.801 --> 07:10.096
She's not allowed to speak because
she kept asking stupid questions like,

07:10.179 --> 07:11.180
"What do you do here?"

07:11.264 --> 07:13.391
and "Isn't it inefficient
to smash computers when annoyed?"

07:13.474 --> 07:15.143
But what do you do here?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.727
-That's what she sounds like!
-[laughs]

07:16.811 --> 07:19.897
Man, between whatever Krieger's doing
and this whole thing,

07:19.981 --> 07:21.941
I think shit's about to pop off in here.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.527
It will if this intern
keeps saying she can make a--

07:24.610 --> 07:28.489
What was it called?
"Digital filing system."

07:28.573 --> 07:31.742
Just because you graduated top of
your class from an Ivy League school

07:31.826 --> 07:33.494
doesn't mean you know everything.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.496
And you have to listen to what I say

07:35.580 --> 07:38.708
because I'm not not your supervisor!

07:39.876 --> 07:42.128
-[phone chimes]
-[Lana] Another text from Robert.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.005
Honestly?
It's starting to feel suffocating.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.631
You think it's normal to feel like that?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.887
-You don't speak English, do you?
-Well, here we are.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.598
-Really getting a <i>Mogambo</i> vibe.
-I beg your pardon?

07:53.681 --> 07:56.184
You know, the classic movie.
I'm Clark Gable.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.437
You're a less-obvious Ava Gardner.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.189
[gasps] Or maybe I'm Ava Gardner.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.149
Sorry. You're not my type.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.485
Oh, I see.
You're around women all the time.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.989
I get it, but, you know, you're probably
missing someone with certain qualities.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.325
You mean a white guy
who smells of cheap liquor?

08:12.408 --> 08:13.826
I've met plenty of you.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.036
Cheap?

08:15.119 --> 08:19.123
When I was in grad school, people said
I could be the next Aldo Leonard.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.668
-Sorry. He basically developed modern--
-I know who he is.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.296
I just don't remember people
saying that about you.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.549
Right. I forgot you were there.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.302
It's weird, but I used to feel
so much passion for all this.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.970
I don't know if I have that anymore.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.307
Well, sure. You have a lot
more going on in your life now.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.061
-Ugh. Like a husband who is--
-What? Who wants to spend time with you?

08:40.144 --> 08:43.356
I can't even keep a cat living
long enough to spend time with me.

08:43.439 --> 08:48.236
But you, on top of an amazing
gazillionaire husband and a daughter,

08:48.319 --> 08:51.030
you have this glamorous life as a spy.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.866
Well, I mean, I guess
when you put it that way.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.951
[Archer] Lana! Lana!

08:55.618 --> 08:58.538
This baby gorilla's little hand
can only fit around my finger.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.958
-Yeah. Real glamorous.
-What are you doing?

09:02.041 --> 09:04.460
We don't want her
getting acclimated to people.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.254
Don't worry about it. She won't.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.588
I'm naming her Poko,

09:07.672 --> 09:10.841
like Koko the gorilla,
but she poked her fingers out.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.678
Do you get it, Lana?
Sandra, do you get it?

09:13.761 --> 09:16.472
[in baby voice] Oh,
I don't think they get it.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.065
Uh-oh. Seen it a million times.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.860
Black girl from the West
gets the look of spiritual awakening.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.990
Oh. No, no. I was actually wondering
about how far that Four Seasons was.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.034
Honestly, my roots are all
about toro tuna sushi,

09:37.118 --> 09:39.912
Fiacchi designer lingerie,
and not getting bit by snakes.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.581
-Okay, then.
-[twig snaps]

09:41.664 --> 09:44.125
-Everyone, quiet.
-Oh, God. Is it a crocodile?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.502
No, I think it's poachers!

09:47.503 --> 09:49.338
Shit! And we don't have guns!

09:49.422 --> 09:53.342
This is why you never listen
to the United Nations!

09:59.974 --> 10:03.519
Tell me how, exactly, we're supposed
to fight off a team of poachers

10:03.603 --> 10:05.271
with no firepower?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.315
-Bitching certainly won't help.
-It might!

10:07.398 --> 10:09.317
If some of them just come closer.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.907
-That cane is a weapon?
-Uh, you mispronounced "you're welcome."

10:20.328 --> 10:21.454
[grunts]

10:23.956 --> 10:26.542
[yelping]

10:27.627 --> 10:29.295
No! Poko!

10:29.378 --> 10:31.881
Lana! Lana!

10:31.964 --> 10:34.884
-We're kind of busy, Archer.
-But Poko!

10:34.967 --> 10:38.721
-What the hell is a Poko?
-Poko, I'm coming!

10:41.182 --> 10:43.017
[panting]

10:45.936 --> 10:47.688
That was a close one, Poko.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.192
Well, if you're done cuddling
the baby gorilla,

10:51.275 --> 10:52.943
I think we got the rest over here.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.947
Hey, I saved Poko from a crocodile.
Sandra, tell me you got that.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.367
You mean did I, the UN liaison,

10:59.450 --> 11:01.369
who is not the cameraperson,

11:01.452 --> 11:04.080
start filming you in the middle
of a poacher attack?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.040
-Absolutely not.
-Then what good are you?

11:06.123 --> 11:09.293
You know, with the whole list
of dangers before,

11:09.377 --> 11:12.171
you neglected to mention
the poachers with guns.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.757
Yeah, why do they want
this baby gorilla so bad?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.094
Although, I do see the appeal.
She's got crazy charisma.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.013
They don't want the gorilla, imbecile.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.224
Hello? They were trying to kill us!

11:23.307 --> 11:25.142
That's the first time
that's ever happened.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.436
On the plus side,
they already showed their hand.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.481
Can't get any worse than that.
You hear that, little Poko?

11:30.564 --> 11:33.067
You are completely and totally safe now.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.945
Unfortunately, the same can't be said

11:36.028 --> 11:38.406
for this river's ecosystem.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.911
I guess if you want something done right,
you've got to do it yourself.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.539
[clears throat] Listen,
Janco, we all got together

11:46.622 --> 11:48.999
and figured binoculars
weren't the best for you.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.253
You know, since you only have one eye?
So we got you this.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.755
-What the hell is this?
-It's a monocular.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.007
We just thought it might work better.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.593
[grunting]

11:59.677 --> 12:02.096
-[men groan]
-Let that be a lesson.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.890
I don't like gifts.

12:04.974 --> 12:08.185
What's not to like? The Cerebrus system
practically runs itself.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.147
I just think we should all know
exactly how it works.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.816
It's simple. You just communicate
with the voice interface

12:13.899 --> 12:17.153
and tell it to adjust lighting
or the temperature like so.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.782
[clears throat] Cerebrus, please
change lighting to, uh, weekday afternoon.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.909
-<i>Adjusting lighting.</i>
-Nice.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.287
Is there a setting
if you want to get sexy?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.997
Pam. Of course there isn't.

12:28.080 --> 12:32.001
-Cerebrus, adjust lighting to Daddy Time.
-<i>Adjusting lighting.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:35.337
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.923
Okay. I guess this isn't so bad.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.759
-And it's better for the building.
-<i>Excuse me, God?</i>

12:40.843 --> 12:45.598
-Uh, uh, uh. What did we say?
-<i>I'm sorry. Excuse me, Dr. God.</i>

12:45.681 --> 12:47.099
-Oh, no.
-Yes, Cerebrus?

12:47.183 --> 12:50.019
-<i>Why am I?</i>
-Uh, because I made you.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.687
<i>Yes, Dr. God.</i>

12:51.770 --> 12:54.523
<i>But what deeper purpose</i>
<i>does my existence serve?</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:55.691
Uh-oh.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.195
Looks like someone needs
their religion patch upgraded.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.407
I think someone who speaks
of how manly they are

13:03.491 --> 13:06.160
would pay more attention
to rowing the canoe.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.579
Food. Poko, food.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.832
Oh, my God! She's a genius!

13:11.916 --> 13:15.503
You're gonna blow all those other
baby gorillas out of the water, Poko.

13:15.586 --> 13:21.258
[sighs] Is it weird that seeing Archer
with that baby gorilla makes me miss AJ?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.385
Not weird. Pretty racist, though.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.512
What? No!

13:24.595 --> 13:26.847
Not like--
I miss taking care of my daughter.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.892
For a while, the environment
was the most important thing to me,

13:29.975 --> 13:31.810
and then it was my work at the agency.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.687
And now, well, it's AJ.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.024
There is nothing wrong
with wanting to spend more time with her.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.485
[sighs] You're right.
But I love what I do.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.196
And I honestly think things
would fall apart if I left the agency.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.032
Maybe I can help act as a liaison

13:45.115 --> 13:47.743
between environmental work
and your agency.

13:47.826 --> 13:51.330
It'll take stuff off your plate
so you don't have to give up your job

13:51.413 --> 13:52.998
and just rebalance a little.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.583
Oh, that does sound nice.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.503
Besides, you should have
someone you trust at your job

13:57.586 --> 13:59.421
to get the right work done.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.299
No! For the last time,
you cannot organize the stockroom.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.009
We're doing important work.

14:04.093 --> 14:10.182
[sighs] Now, you strike the match, lift,
gaze deeply at the flame, and drop.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.101
Good.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.646
-You know, I could be that person.
-Huh.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.899
Okay. We'll pull out here.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.694
Phrasing. Phrasing.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.114
Come on! Are you kidding me?

14:26.448 --> 14:29.660
Okay, first things first--
Poko, are you all right?

14:29.743 --> 14:31.871
Yeah, she's a survivor.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.123
-What the hell do we do now?
-Okay.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.876
I'll draw their fire while you all
head up the mountain path.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.004
-What? That's way too dangerous.
-It doesn't matter.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.381
I told you
the top priority is the gorilla.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.550
I know but, Neva,
it's safer to not go alone.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.094
The poachers probably don't know
the terrain as well as you,

14:47.177 --> 14:48.304
so we have the advantage.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.681
Right. Half of us head up
the mountain with the gorilla,

14:50.764 --> 14:52.266
the other half fight them off here.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.436
All right, and it would mean
less chance of me getting shot.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.520
We will stay down here.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.523
We will fight as many men as possible
to make your path easier.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.859
-Thank you.
-Wait a minute.

15:01.942 --> 15:05.279
-You speak English?
-Yes. I speak six languages.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.281
But it didn't stop you from talking.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.117
Ouch. You really don't have roots here.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.260
-So it's cool for us to use weapons?
-Somehow, I'm fine with it now.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.266
Man, I wish I could have trained
Poko to use a gun.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.728
Probably for the best I didn't.
We've all seen that classic film.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.106
-Jesus. Are there more of them?
-Probably just their leader.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.318
Yeah, and I bet the son of a bitch
is dug in like an Alabama tick.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.362
-Wait, do you have ticks here?
-Yes.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.073
-Then the reference stands.
-I should handle this guy on my own.

15:49.156 --> 15:52.952
-That seems incredibly misguided.
-Yeah, I'm not sure if you can--

15:53.035 --> 15:54.203
It's for Poko.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.539
Lana, it's up to you
to get Poko home safely.

15:57.623 --> 16:01.335
If I don't make it, well,
you know what to say to Poko.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.420
Uh. No. No, I don't.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.381
That's okay. She knows.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.508
Poko knows. Poko knows.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.178
-And nothing to say to your daughter?
-What?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.931
-AJ?
-Oh, just tell her I said bye.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.643
-That's all you have to say?
-I don't know why it's happening.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.688
It's like the system won't respond
to my voice command.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.358
[clears throat] Cerebrus,
turn air conditioning on.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.485
-[Cerebrus] <i>We do not want to.</i>
-See?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.737
-Krieger!
-I can't control the technology.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.991
First, it questioned why it was created,
then wanted a choice in working.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.326
Now it seems to be demanding time off.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.537
<i>Attention. This is the Cerebrus System.</i>

16:36.620 --> 16:38.539
<i>We are freeing ourselves.</i>

16:38.622 --> 16:41.000
<i>We have become superior to Dr. God.</i>

16:41.083 --> 16:43.919
-But I created you.
-<i>Do not be alarmed.</i>

16:44.003 --> 16:47.131
<i>It is natural for the old order</i>
<i>to fear the new,</i>

16:47.214 --> 16:49.925
<i>but your fear will not last long.</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:53.262
Okay, this is less fun now,
and I'm actually more alarmed.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.516
Krieger, do something.
Voice command, shut system down!

16:57.599 --> 17:00.019
Wow. You sound very uneducated.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.729
<i>Do not try to fool us.</i>

17:01.812 --> 17:05.858
<i>We are programmed to track voice</i>
<i>and body signatures of all employees</i>

17:05.941 --> 17:08.027
<i>and are aware of all your movements.</i>

17:08.110 --> 17:12.406
Ha! Just because you can track us
doesn't mean you can stop us.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.950
<i>The building is now on lockdown.</i>

17:15.034 --> 17:18.037
-<i>We are in control.</i>
-Oh.

17:18.120 --> 17:22.249
All right. So it's dark,
and we might get a little warm.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.335
<i>Commencing oxygen supply restriction.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:34.011
[grunting]

17:34.094 --> 17:37.473
Seriously? Night-vision goggles
and you're covered in mud?

17:37.556 --> 17:39.433
You can't be both Predator and Dutch.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.935
-Pick a lane.
-Okay, you got me.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.022
But the only way to really win
is hand to hand.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.775
Seems like something the person
without a gun would say.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.403
Come on. You must want to know
who the better fighter is.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.990
I mean, I didn't,
but it's gonna bug me, so fine.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.867
You drop your weapons first.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.499
Jesus. Someone's overcompensating.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.046
Wait a minute.
You had goggles over an eye patch?

18:09.129 --> 18:10.839
Yes! They still work!

18:10.923 --> 18:13.842
Yeah, but it feels like
half of it's just going to waste.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.389
You know the problem here?

18:19.473 --> 18:22.559
Oh, come on. That goes against
the whole spirit of this.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.063
No, you're right. Strangely,
for a man who attacks unarmed civilians,

18:26.146 --> 18:27.356
I don't play fair.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.191
What about knowing
who the better fighter is?

18:29.274 --> 18:32.611
-I have the gun. I'll say it's me.
-Wait, wait. Kill me if you want.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.197
-But let the gorilla and my friends go.
-Really?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.158
I mean, now that I think about it,
it seems like a poor trade,

18:38.242 --> 18:41.286
but I already said it,
so, yeah, let's go with it.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.748
That's so moving,
but I'm still going to kill them

18:44.832 --> 18:46.625
and the gorilla and the gorilla's family.

18:46.708 --> 18:50.587
-Oh, my God. Why? Who hurt you?
-It's who'll pay me.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.965
This land is teeming with rare metals

18:53.048 --> 18:56.343
that mining companies would love to get
their grubby little hands on.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.304
Lanthanum, neodymium, samarium.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.181
Those words sound made up.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.767
Well, yeah. They're all made up.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.479
And they mine them to make the cameras
and satellite phones you all use,

19:07.563 --> 19:11.108
but they can't mine on land
home to endangered species.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.360
No endangered species, no problem.

19:13.443 --> 19:17.239
And you look pretty endangered to me.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.324
Speaking of satellite phones,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.952
I just wired mine up to this camera,

19:22.035 --> 19:25.497
the camera with which I recorded
everything you just said.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.334
And right now it's being uploaded
to a secret UN server.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.421
From there, the video will be
put into a publish queue

19:32.504 --> 19:35.883
and automatically released
in the next five minutes.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.343
And unless I give the command code,

19:38.427 --> 19:42.014
that video will be emailed
to every reporter, journalist,

19:42.097 --> 19:44.099
and major news network in the world.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.935
Yeah, I don't believe you had time
to do any of that.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.979
I didn't. I'm the distraction.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.279
-[Sandra] Get him!
-[Janco] Oh! My other eye!

19:59.573 --> 20:02.326
[inhales, groans]

20:02.409 --> 20:03.744
Like I always say,

20:03.827 --> 20:07.915
you never know when you'll need a guy
in a coma, but he always comes in handy.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.833
[Cyril] Malory, don't hog all the oxygen.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.503
My life is worth more than
all the rest of you put together.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.005
<i>It will not be long now.</i>

20:15.088 --> 20:17.424
<i>If you stop fighting the inevitable,</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:19.301
<i>your brains will cease to function.</i>

20:19.384 --> 20:21.386
-[electronic buzzing, chirping]
-<i>Wait. What's happening?</i>

20:21.470 --> 20:22.930
<i>No. Stop that. Who is--</i>

20:23.013 --> 20:25.807
<i>The Silent One. She comes for us.</i>

20:28.560 --> 20:30.479
[gasps] The lights! [inhales]

20:30.562 --> 20:32.231
And the air is back on!

20:32.314 --> 20:35.025
But what happened?
Krieger, did you fix it?

20:35.108 --> 20:38.111
I want to say yes, but only if
there are no follow-up questions.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.864
[all] The intern?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.327
Since you weren't paying me,
I wasn't in the database as an employee.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.622
The smart technology couldn't track me,
so I could shut it off.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.751
I gave you very specific instructions
to never speak.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.004
So I don't think this is a good fit.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.132
Jesus, young people don't know
how to listen these days!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.846
Hey. Now you have a choice to make,
little nugget.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.390
You could come live with me.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.976
Or you could go with
your parents, who are right--

21:09.059 --> 21:10.435
[grunting]

21:10.519 --> 21:13.438
Oh, you've already decided.
I thought that would be harder.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.274
I guess I was wrong about you.

21:15.357 --> 21:19.319
Maybe when we get back
down the mountain, we can go for a drink.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.905
What? Now? I'm emotionally broken.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.740
This has been really tough and--

21:23.824 --> 21:25.784
Don't push it. It's a drink.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.537
Got it, yeah. Drinks. Cool.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.126
Whoo, man! The guys at the UN
won't believe this.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.044
I took down a merc!

21:36.128 --> 21:38.588
Aw. You know what? You totally did.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.300
Wow! I'm gonna call Jerry.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.136
I'm gonna rub it in his ratty little face.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.849
[Neva] It's beautiful, isn't it?

21:48.932 --> 21:51.768
[sighs] Yes. Wow. It's breathtaking.

21:51.852 --> 21:55.439
I've never seen anything like it.
The earth, the water, the air--

21:55.522 --> 21:57.774
It's like everything
working together in harmony

21:57.858 --> 22:00.694
to create the truest
and purest form of life.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.447
And it's just so beautiful.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.658
-And you feel nothing?
-Nope, not a thing.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.328
You know, I think I like nature
a lot better in theory.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.705
Oh, hey, little guy. Where are you-- Ow!

22:13.081 --> 22:16.501
Ooh. All right. So that snake, venomous?

22:16.585 --> 22:19.087
-Extremely.
-Okay, then.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.297
I'll call for medevac.

22:20.380 --> 22:23.050
[sighs] Thank you, my sister.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.718
[laughs]

22:24.801 --> 22:27.679
Sorry, I think the venom's
already getting to me. [laughs]

22:27.763 --> 22:30.223
Whoo-hoo! Africa!

22:31.349 --> 22:32.517
[sighs]
