this is the TIMS lab.

11:32.771 --> 11:34.980
TIMS?

11:34.981 --> 11:37.485

11:37.485 --> 11:38.609
Of course.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.360
That's Alice. She's looking at

11:40.361 --> 11:42.029
- chondritic meteorites.
- Hi.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.280

Here's another
mass spectrometer.

11:52.123 --> 11:54.333
Eric, our visiting

11:54.334 --> 11:57.002
volcanologist. We love him.

11:57.003 --> 11:58.545
We're trying to make him
stay with us forever.

11:58.546 --> 12:00.422
- Hi.
- <i>If people like you,</i>

12:00.423 --> 12:01.840
<i>use it against them.</i>

12:01.841 --> 12:04.218
There's an SEM, too,
upstairs, of course.

12:04.219 --> 12:05.677
Fair warning, though,

12:05.678 --> 12:07.679
it gets busy.
The team just back from

12:37.919 --> 12:39.545
Hi.

12:39.546 --> 12:41.213
Did I get fired?

12:41.214 --> 12:43.882

12:43.883 --> 12:45.344

12:45.344 --> 12:47.636
I'm Danny,
the new research associate.

12:47.637 --> 12:50.097
Oh. Hi. Uh, Rose. Uh, Danny...

12:50.098 --> 12:51.892
Daniela Moreno Acosta.

12:51.892 --> 12:54.226
Oh. Acosta... Spanish?

12:54.227 --> 12:56.063
Studied in Madrid
and just finished

12:56.063 --> 12:57.437
my second degree in geophysics

12:57.438 --> 12:59.108
at the University of Barcelona.

12:59.108 --> 13:02.359
Ah. Did, um,
did Manny show you around?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.611
Yeah. Okay.

13:04.612 --> 13:07.281
Oh, Manny and Danny, right?

13:07.282 --> 13:09.368
I met most of the team.

13:09.368 --> 13:10.619
Nice.

13:11.912 --> 13:13.620
Who's that?

13:13.621 --> 13:15.914
That is Reza.

13:15.915 --> 13:17.749
He runs the exchange program.

13:17.750 --> 13:20.252
He picks a candidate to take
back to Tehran for the year,

13:20.253 --> 13:22.965
and everyone's sucking up.

13:24.383 --> 13:26.174
Do you see, um,
see that guy there?

13:26.175 --> 13:27.217
That's Jerome.

13:27.218 --> 13:29.511
He's Reza's human jockstrap.

13:29.512 --> 13:31.430
He even plays squash with him.

13:31.431 --> 13:32.890
So, everyone wants to go?

13:32.891 --> 13:34.433

13:34.434 --> 13:36.685

is the shit, right?

13:36.686 --> 13:38.103
Yeah.

13:38.104 --> 13:40.898
Isn't it a...
isn't it a scary country?

13:40.899 --> 13:43.567

oh, sure, but it's just...

13:43.568 --> 13:45.446

13:45.446 --> 13:47.946
Um... yeah. Tell you what,
I'll-I'll introduce you.

13:47.947 --> 13:49.450
Come, come.

13:52.661 --> 13:55.078
Professor Mortazevi?
May I introduce Danny,

13:55.079 --> 13:57.956
the new recruit from Spain,
postdoc Barcelona Uni.

13:57.957 --> 14:00.000
Nice to meet you, señorita.

14:00.001 --> 14:01.670
Jerome. Hi.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.462
- Hello.
- Do you play squash?

14:03.463 --> 14:06.173
- Do you?
- No.

14:06.174 --> 14:07.925
Oh. This guy
spanks me every time.

14:07.926 --> 14:10.220
Can't get within, like,
five points of him, basically.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.678
But you love it, though, right?

14:11.679 --> 14:14.264
Right. Well, we have about

14:14.265 --> 14:16.099
45 minutes, so, rematch?

14:16.100 --> 14:18.354
- Sure.
- Great.

14:19.521 --> 14:20.940
Hasta luego.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.317
See?

14:25.318 --> 14:27.277
Right up his arse.

14:27.278 --> 14:29.404
I've given up.

14:29.405 --> 14:31.406
You don't want to go to Tehran?

14:31.407 --> 14:33.116
Are you nuts?
Of course I do.

14:33.117 --> 14:36.119
It's just, the Iranians
would never take a girl. Ever.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.915
Rose? Do you have a moment?

14:37.915 --> 14:39.500
Oh, hey.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.249
Sorry, I meant
to get back to you.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.294
<i>♪ quiet, dramatic music ♪</i>

14:53.597 --> 14:54.848
Have you seen much of London?

14:55.849 --> 14:58.392
Our work here has kept me busy.

14:58.393 --> 15:00.396
I know the city well.

15:00.396 --> 15:02.020
London is for having fun

15:02.021 --> 15:05.109
as well as working.
Perhaps I could show you around.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.900
Mrs. Zahir,

15:06.901 --> 15:09.987
your husband Dr. Mustafa called.

15:09.988 --> 15:12.157
I told him
you would return his call.

15:16.453 --> 15:18.288
Excuse me.

15:47.026 --> 15:48.986
<i>♪ quiet, dramatic music ♪</i>

16:25.397 --> 16:27.608
You want anything else?

16:27.608 --> 16:28.607
Some fruit?

16:28.608 --> 16:30.319
Some cookies?

16:32.404 --> 16:33.571
You got any blow?

16:36.450 --> 16:38.243
Or, like, ketamine?

16:47.961 --> 16:49.755
Look...

16:52.174 --> 16:53.924
...I've only been a dad

16:53.925 --> 16:56.301
for as long
as you've been a daughter.

16:56.302 --> 16:58.847
We're both making this up
as we go along.

17:01.475 --> 17:04.059
But while you were busy
being a daughter,

17:04.060 --> 17:06.146
I wasn't there.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.899
We both know why,
but that's no excuse.

17:13.028 --> 17:15.028
So...

17:15.029 --> 17:16.740
I apologize.

17:18.909 --> 17:20.619
And I would like

17:20.619 --> 17:23.247
for us to try
and make a fresh start.

17:37.344 --> 17:39.388
That's all I got.

17:42.015 --> 17:43.851
That's what my therapist
said you would say.

17:43.851 --> 17:45.352
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:45.352 --> 17:48.019
Small world,
'cause that's what my therapist

17:48.020 --> 17:49.771
told me to say.

17:49.772 --> 17:51.189
You have a therapist?

17:51.190 --> 17:53.108
- Actually, yes.
- Since when?

17:53.109 --> 17:54.694
Since I got back.

17:56.655 --> 17:58.488
That is... that's so fucked up.

17:58.489 --> 18:00.031
Thank you.

18:00.032 --> 18:01.368
No, Dad, I'm serious.

18:01.368 --> 18:02.701
That's like you telling me
you joined,

18:02.702 --> 18:03.535
like, a ballet school
or something.

18:03.536 --> 18:04.870
Thank you,

18:04.871 --> 18:06.955
I appreciate it,
and I'll pass it on.

18:06.956 --> 18:09.583
I do think we need
a fresh start, though.

18:09.584 --> 18:12.963
We should mark it,
do something together.

18:12.963 --> 18:14.337
Like what?

18:14.338 --> 18:16.840
You should...

18:16.841 --> 18:20.387
take me shopping and buy me
a bunch of shit I can't afford?

18:22.097 --> 18:24.181
- Makes sense.
- Yeah,

18:24.182 --> 18:26.266
whereupon I will
forgive you for everything.

18:26.267 --> 18:28.476
- Everything?
- Everything. The whole nine.

18:28.477 --> 18:30.687
All the pain, the confusion.

18:30.688 --> 18:34.816
It shall vanish.
Your soul shall be wiped clean

18:34.817 --> 18:37.738
by the pure clean waters
of a nearby shopping center.

18:42.451 --> 18:43.869
We can do this, Dad.

18:47.039 --> 18:49.082
Together.

18:49.082 --> 18:51.376
You're on.

18:54.296 --> 18:56.046
So, how long you got?

18:56.047 --> 18:57.047
An hour.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.382
Okay, well, we do provide

18:59.383 --> 19:01.259
a comprehensive, deluxe

19:01.260 --> 19:03.596

soul cleansing service.

19:05.182 --> 19:06.890
Mm. But the bad news is

19:06.891 --> 19:09.559
it's twice as expensive
as the two-hour package.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.438
Ooh.

19:11.438 --> 19:13.023

19:14.316 --> 19:16.149

19:18.904 --> 19:20.405

two separate parties.

- Oh, it's good for 'em.

<i>When did you last have sex

21:02.507 --> 21:04.092
You go first.

21:07.596 --> 21:10.223
I haven't had sex in 17 months.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.808
Not since a...

21:13.809 --> 21:15.643
messy rebound fuck in a bar

21:15.644 --> 21:17.356
after I separated
with my husband.

21:20.525 --> 21:23.568
I've been telling myself
that I'm concentrating on work,

21:23.569 --> 21:27.699
moving countries,
but really I'm just scared.

21:28.950 --> 21:31.868
It's been years

21:31.869 --> 21:35.038
since I dated and I...

21:35.039 --> 21:39.042
I found that a one-night stand
in Georgetown

21:39.043 --> 21:41.421
just made me sad.

21:44.174 --> 21:46.635
Is it my turn?

21:47.761 --> 21:50.261
- Yes, it is.
- What was the question?

21:50.262 --> 21:52.224
You know what the question was.

21:58.563 --> 22:00.939
<i>Not since I was in Addis.</i>

22:00.940 --> 22:03.610
<i>I was in a relationship,
one that you know about,</i>

22:03.610 --> 22:06.071
<i>that I broke off
because of my exfil.</i>

22:09.950 --> 22:12.953
- Do you miss her?
- I loved her.

22:14.746 --> 22:16.248
I think so.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.836
Whatever it was,
whatever those feelings...

22:23.505 --> 22:26.591
...they were more for her
than anyone I've ever met.

22:28.593 --> 22:31.886
I don't know how many chances...

22:31.887 --> 22:34.013
at feeling like that
life gives you.

22:34.014 --> 22:35.976
My guess is not many.

22:38.311 --> 22:41.438
- That's hard to cope with.
- It's not hard.

22:41.439 --> 22:43.191
It's impossible.

22:43.191 --> 22:45.402
Unless you've spent your
whole life in training for it.

22:46.528 --> 22:49.197
You seal it in a box, bury it.

22:49.197 --> 22:51.825
Do your job. Carry on.

22:53.034 --> 22:54.411
Wounds heal.

22:55.954 --> 22:57.789
They become stories.

23:01.334 --> 23:03.084
Like that one on your hand.

23:03.085 --> 23:06.171
Can you tell me
how you came by it?

23:06.172 --> 23:08.008
This?

23:09.009 --> 23:10.886
Avocado pit.

23:24.149 --> 23:27.360
Most of the damage
in an earthquake like this

23:27.360 --> 23:30.779
is usually caused
by the surface waves.

23:32.157 --> 23:35.283
You can see here
the staggered arrivals

23:35.284 --> 23:38.038
of the different
seismic phases at stations

23:38.038 --> 23:40.455
across the Global
Seismographic Network.

23:40.456 --> 23:42.165
But new instrumentation gives us

23:42.166 --> 23:45.212
a more detailed picture
than ever before.

Great job.

25:24.768 --> 25:27.812
Any more dumb questions?
You said this was urgent.

25:27.813 --> 25:29.733
At 7 p.m. in front of
every expert in the country

25:29.733 --> 25:31.399
at some black-tie fundraiser,

25:31.400 --> 25:33.067
I have to deliver an overview

25:33.068 --> 25:36.112
from my direct experience
of distributed acoustic sensing.

25:36.113 --> 25:37.991
What's that?

25:37.991 --> 25:40.450
I have no idea,
but it's on my résumé.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.036
How many pages
can you memorize fast? Ten? 20?

25:43.037 --> 25:45.496
20 to 25.

25:45.497 --> 25:47.167
25 an hour?

25:47.167 --> 25:49.669
25 in total.

25:54.841 --> 25:57.218
- How'd it go with Dr. Blake?
- Good.

25:57.218 --> 25:59.010
Say no more.

25:59.011 --> 26:00.345
Uh, do you have a second?

26:00.346 --> 26:01.596
Simon, how can I help you?

26:01.597 --> 26:03.473
I got more on that target
for you.

26:03.474 --> 26:05.183
She's not a target, she's a POI.

26:05.184 --> 26:06.517
What have you got?

26:06.518 --> 26:09.646
Uh, yes, so,
um, since April 2018,

26:09.647 --> 26:13.024
she taught at the Addis Ababa
Central University.

26:13.025 --> 26:14.901
And the last three months,
she's been a visiting fellow

26:14.902 --> 26:16.736
at the Public University
of Khartoum,

26:16.737 --> 26:18.279
and, um, she was elected head

26:18.280 --> 26:21.074
of the Sudanese Center
for Cultural Heritage.

26:21.075 --> 26:23.451
She ever disappear
for any length of time?

26:23.452 --> 26:24.952
A few days even?

26:24.953 --> 26:27.080
Any contact with Ministry
of Internal Affairs

26:27.081 --> 26:28.667
or the security departments?

26:28.667 --> 26:30.041
No, the only unusual thing

26:30.042 --> 26:31.961
was contact
with a lawyer in Khartoum.

26:31.961 --> 26:33.544
Uh, it looks like
she's getting a divorce.

26:33.545 --> 26:37.215
It's unusual in her culture
but not unheard of.

26:37.216 --> 26:39.427
Uh, maybe not relevant
to your focus.

26:40.595 --> 26:42.387
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26:42.388 --> 26:44.140
The divorce is real.
Lawyer's real.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.391
They filed it
and started proceedings.

26:46.392 --> 26:49.062
I mean, the war's upped
divorces by, like, 50%.

26:51.898 --> 26:53.525
Very good.

26:57.195 --> 26:59.404
Backscattered signals
from imperfections

26:59.405 --> 27:01.030
in the optic fiber that backs...

27:01.031 --> 27:03.282
Ah, fuck.
The interrogation unit...

27:03.283 --> 27:04.784
...receives
backscattered signals...

27:04.785 --> 27:07.412
imperfections
in the optic fiber.

27:07.413 --> 27:10.748
Interrogation unit receives
backscattered signals...

27:10.749 --> 27:12.542
from imperfections
in the optic fiber.

27:12.543 --> 27:16.379
Acoustic waves change
the fiber's signal shape,

27:16.380 --> 27:18.923

27:18.924 --> 27:20.925

27:20.926 --> 27:22.345

the backscattered signals,

27:22.345 --> 27:24.470
which can be converted
to strain rate.

27:24.471 --> 27:26.723

27:26.724 --> 27:28.476

27:45.076 --> 27:47.078

27:48.788 --> 27:52.540
Spectral analysis
of frequencies in the signal...

27:52.541 --> 27:54.625
can identify seismic phases.

27:54.626 --> 27:57.962
Spectral analysis

27:57.963 --> 28:00.300

All right, let's go.

28:09.392 --> 28:11.394

in your car?

28:11.394 --> 28:13.396
Sorry, I don't.

28:24.407 --> 28:26.908
Sorry I didn't have a charger.

28:26.909 --> 28:28.453
Not a problem.

28:29.621 --> 28:32.872

from unused telecommunication,

28:32.873 --> 28:36.501
uh, infrastructures can-can be
uti... can be utilized.

28:36.502 --> 28:37.962
I'm sorry?

28:37.962 --> 28:39.629
Nothing.

28:39.630 --> 28:42.300
Going over my speech.

28:43.384 --> 28:45.637
Lot of important people there.

28:50.308 --> 28:53.935
Relax.
This is a home game for you.

29:44.737 --> 29:46.698
It's something
I've thought about a lot.

29:53.246 --> 29:55.748
I don't think
this is a good idea.

Your father's.

30:33.786 --> 30:35.288
How old is your father?

30:36.664 --> 30:38.625
He died when I was six.

30:38.625 --> 30:41.083
He was 35.

30:41.084 --> 30:42.919
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- All I remember

30:42.920 --> 30:45.796
are his kind, sweet,

30:45.797 --> 30:48.259

I'm hugely flattered an-an-and
I enjoy working with you a lot.

31:00.813 --> 31:03.816
Of course, but I-I understand.

31:05.818 --> 31:08.279
Listen, this event
we're going to

31:08.279 --> 31:11.739
is the Institute's

31:11.740 --> 31:13.157
I can see how nervous you are.

31:13.158 --> 31:14.784
Maybe it's kinder to let someone

31:14.785 --> 31:17.578
with more experience
make the address.

31:17.579 --> 31:19.747
Jerome, perhaps.

31:19.748 --> 31:22.166
I can let you out here.

31:22.167 --> 31:24.293
Wait, I'm-I'm not even coming?

31:24.294 --> 31:26.798
No, there's really no need.

31:28.883 --> 31:32.178
It's fine.
I don't want you to be anxious.

31:36.057 --> 31:37.850
- See you in the office.
- Okay.

32:00.623 --> 32:03.668
We have nothing
like this in Minsk.

32:05.086 --> 32:07.005
We're not in Kansas anymore.

32:08.923 --> 32:10.508
Yeah, I can see.

32:12.427 --> 32:14.176
I love it here. Anything goes.

32:14.177 --> 32:15.678
Tell me about it.

32:15.679 --> 32:18.222
Last week my bike got stolen
around here.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.057
Lot of crime in London?

32:20.058 --> 32:21.559
Had it 20 years.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.520
It had my phone number
engraved on the crossbar.

32:24.521 --> 32:26.605
If the guy who stole it
called me,

32:26.606 --> 32:30.026
I'd give him five times
what it's worth.

32:30.027 --> 32:31.279
Like that jet.

32:32.238 --> 32:33.781
In our meeting?

32:33.781 --> 32:36.282
Your MiG fighter that vanished
over the Baltic?

32:36.283 --> 32:39.869
I-I don't follow you.

32:39.870 --> 32:43.581
I mean, if you lose something
and you really want it back,

32:43.582 --> 32:46.878
maybe it's worth
more than face value.

32:46.878 --> 32:48.796
A lot more.

32:50.298 --> 32:53.591
Ask me if I'd buy my bike back.

32:53.592 --> 32:55.885
I'd say, "Name your price."

32:55.886 --> 32:57.094
You're very...

32:57.095 --> 32:59.849
sentimental.

this is my number.

33:12.111 --> 33:15.071

33:15.072 --> 33:17.907
