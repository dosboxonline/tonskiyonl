WEBVTT

00:56.890 --> 00:59.848
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.320
- Hey, Dave.
- Hi Sara.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.704
Fun party, huh?

01:22.874 --> 01:25.411
Yeah. Except for Arnie Shankman
being here.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.828
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.673
I feel bad for him with his sister
losing her mind and all.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.093
Whatever.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.423
You know what we should do?
Play truth or dare.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.016
You want to? Sure.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.848
Okay, I'll go first. Truth or dare?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.481
Truth

01:48.191 --> 01:49.931
have you ever kissed a girl before?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.691
- Well, I...
- Family doesn't count.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.862
- Maybe I'll take dare.
- Okay.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.031
I dare you to kiss me.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.237
Right here?

02:00.412 --> 02:04.155
Yeah. I want everyone to see
that your first kiss is with me.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.855
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank,
butt-lick?

02:45.582 --> 02:48.073
- David buznik.
- I just landed in St. Louis.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.914
- I hope you wrote my speech.
- I did, sir. I pulled an all nighter.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.956
I look forward to this, Mr. head.
Never been to St. Louis.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.959
Thank you for allowing me
to come on this trip...

03:00.222 --> 03:02.213
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that sounds great.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.133
If we finish our work,
I'd love to go to a jazz club.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.310
Terrific.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.595
- He hung up on you again, didn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he did.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.433
He's a jerk. You came up with the idea
for the husky cat clothing line.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.397
He didn't say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.529
There's a creative executive position
that just opened up, so...

03:19.700 --> 03:22.942
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.156
I know. I'll figure something out.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.530
I gotta go. Sorry.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.621
I'm gonna miss youl.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.456
That guy's looking at us.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.247
You know I don't like it when people
watch me kiss.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.506
I'm sorry.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.130
Take care.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.296
Okay. Bye.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.143
Dave

03:49.020 --> 03:51.477
- have a good flight.
- Okay.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.480
I'm sorry.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.664
I think you're in my seat.

04:12.502 --> 04:16.165
Come on, pal. I'm already settled in
here. Can't you sit somewhere else?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.589
You're supposed to sit in the seat
they assigned you.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.718
Nobody cares. Just sit in the seat
I'm supposed to sit in.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.507
Excuse me. This seat's available.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.100
Okay. Thank you.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.848
You're very welcome.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.482
No air.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.022
That's too bad, huh?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.707
You're on my side of the armrest.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.088
We're not gonna have problems,
are we?

05:00.717 --> 05:01.717
No

05:34.292 --> 05:36.749
I'm wetting my jockeys here.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.835
You gotta get a load of this, keed.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.843
I mean, you like comedies?

05:48.014 --> 05:52.428
I just haven't been sleeping a lot
lately so I was trying to catch some...

05:59.192 --> 06:01.274
I ook at this actress here.

06:02.279 --> 06:06.113
What is your position
on breast implants?

06:07.951 --> 06:08.986
This guy.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.651
I can just watch the movie with you.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.786
Fxcuse me.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.164
- Could I get a headset?
- Certainly.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.581
Thank you.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.044
Probably make out
with my next boyfriend.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.545
Oh, my god, it was disgusting.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.718
Miss?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.012
I'll be right there, sir.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.935
Where's your headset?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.477
She's busy right now, but it's coming.

06:42.110 --> 06:46.353
For crying out loud.
You're missing important plot points.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.903
Ma'am?

06:51.161 --> 06:53.152
Could you give me a second, sir?

07:03.673 --> 07:04.879
Fxcuse me.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.465
Could I maybe get that headset,
please?

07:07.636 --> 07:11.174
- Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
- I wasn't raising my voice.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.428
Just calm down.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.464
I am calm. I just want my headset.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.259
Our country is going through
a difficult time now.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.973
If you won't cooperate...

07:19.147 --> 07:22.139
No, I'm gonna cooperate. My plan
is to get the headset from you...

07:22.317 --> 07:25.684
Watch the movie, and laugh
in a very cooperative way.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.853
Is there a problem here, sir?

07:28.949 --> 07:30.189
I don't think so.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.234
Can you come to the back with me
so we can have a talk?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.527
A talk about what?
There's not a problem.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.475
The flight attendant keeps
ignoring me when...

07:37.499 --> 07:38.534
Calm down.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.664
I am calm.
What is it with you people?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.451
"You people"?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.202
Now wait a minute.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.997
I don't mean you people.
I mean you people.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.008
I will not tolerate any racist
behaviour on the plane.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.339
This 1s a difficult time
for our country.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.176
I'm not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.934
I'm only going to say this
one more time, sir. Calm down.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.184
I'm calm!

08:07.696 --> 08:09.152
All rise.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.317
- What do you think?
- Not guilty. It's a no-brainer.

08:15.495 --> 08:21.991
Mr. buznik. In case 723, assault and
battery against a flight attendant...

08:22.752 --> 08:23.912
I find you guilty.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.582
I'm ordering you to pay a fine
of $3500.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.919
Thank god you're okay.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.927
In addition, to prevent
further acts of rage...

08:34.097 --> 08:39.182
This court orders you to undergo 20
hours of anger management therapy.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.018
Anger management?

09:05.628 --> 09:06.834
Dr. Rydell?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.460
You don't remember me, do you?

09:11.926 --> 09:17.137
- I sat next to you on the plane.
- Oh, yeah, the headset guy.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.465
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.803
That was a crazy flight.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.596
They actually sentenced me
to anger management for that.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.934
Really?

09:28.777 --> 09:31.314
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...

09:31.488 --> 09:34.480
And tell them I don't have
an anger problem if you want.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.696
I can't just sign your papers.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.077
I didn't do anything wrong.
You know that

09:42.832 --> 09:43.947
all right.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.741
How's this?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.330
Just hang for one session...

09:48.505 --> 09:52.123
80 I can at least say
I gave you a proper analysis.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.292
- Then I'll sign your papers.
- Okay.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.338
- Shall we?
- Oh, ves. Yes.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.509
So my boss, he was talking to me
about how many sick days I've taken.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.927
And I was like, you know,
"don't go there."

10:06.106 --> 10:09.849
But he kept on about wanting to see
a doctor's note or something.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.769
And I said, "look, I'm seriously
serious. You don't want to go there."

10:14.030 --> 10:17.363
But he kept talking and talking,
being such a nag...

10:17.534 --> 10:19.946
And then I just blacked out.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.280
I blacked out.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.038
And when I woke up, I was standing
over him and I was screaming:

10:25.208 --> 10:29.952
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there!"

10:31.881 --> 10:34.042
How do you feel you
handled that situation?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.007
Not as well as I could've.

10:37.178 --> 10:42.423
Remember, Lou, temper's the one
thing you can't get rid of by losing it.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.099
Now, fury fighters,
let's say hello to someone...

10:48.273 --> 10:52.437
Wwho's joining our quest to get
the anger monkeys off our backs:

10:52.610 --> 10:54.726
- Dave.
- Hi, Dave.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.904
Hi

10:56.614 --> 11:00.232
Good news, I fed my anger monkey
a banana this morning...

11:00.410 --> 11:02.025
And he's feeling much better.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.080
More good news, you won't have to
listen to those lame jokes...

11:08.251 --> 11:10.242
Because I'm only here
for one session.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.709
Dave assaulted a female
flight attendant in midair.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.253
- Nice.
- I bet you beat her good.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.924
I didn't beat anybody.
I touched a woman.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.134
Liar. Bullshitter.
You're a womah beater.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.096
You can't admit it because you're
a piece of garbage.

11:27.270 --> 11:31.730
I don't know about all that,
but now I understand why you're here.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.771
I'm here because I was verbally
attacked by my neighbour.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.436
And I took a dump on his porch.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.441
I guess you're better than me.
That's why you can't cop to your rage.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.234
You're superior. He's superior.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.280
- Maybe Dave's not ready yet, Chuck.
- You're not ready. Hear what he said?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.995
Let's introduce Dave
to some of the rest of us.

11:51.169 --> 11:54.002
Girls, why don't you tell Dave
what brought you here.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.960
I'm sure he'd love to listen
to what you guys have to say.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.590
We always do.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.135
- Come on, Dave. Join us.
- Okay.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.100
Okay. Well, we're
in the adult film industry.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.430
And we're lovers.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.563
One day, Gina was having sex
with this Filipino guy melo...

12:13.733 --> 12:16.816
Which was cool, it was in the script.
Sure.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.477
And then I asked melo
back to the house with us.

12:19.656 --> 12:23.069
Which is cool, because,
well, we like a little variety.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.983
Variety's good.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.778
So anyway, in the middle
of our session

12:27.956 --> 12:30.914
I look up and I see Gina
kissing melo on the mouth...

12:31.084 --> 12:34.668
Which is not cool because it
violates our threesome code of ethics.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.169
- Stacy bit my toe off.
- Then melo freaks out...

12:37.507 --> 12:40.840
- And calls me a crazy skank.
- Nobody talks to my bitch that way.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.217
- So I stapled his lips shut.
- Here we are.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.422
Well, we've all been there.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.760
- I like him.
- Yeah, he's funny.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.303
Not as funny as you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.432
I like that.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.987
- All right, girls.
- Let it go. Let it go a little bit longer.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.449
Walk it off.

13:07.161 --> 13:11.370
Nate. Didn't we decide that you
shouldn't listen to the ball game?

13:11.541 --> 13:15.033
Don't worry, Dr. b, it's just a regular
season game. Not important.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.917
He missed the lay-up!

13:17.088 --> 13:20.330
See? Lverson just missed a lay-up
at the buzzer, sixers lose.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.964
Who gives a crap, huh?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.376
I mean, it's just a silly game, anyways.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.134
The anger sharks are swimming
in my head.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.052
You gotta dunk that shit!

13:34.230 --> 13:36.391
You gotta dunk that shit!

13:36.566 --> 13:38.431
Listen to me. Stay with me, Nate.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.566
Now, repeat after me, Nate:

13:40.737 --> 13:42.978
(Soosfraba.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.021
(500s blah blah.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.690
Not "blah blah," Nate.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.155
(Soosfraba.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.073
That's good. Slower.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.960
(Soosfraba.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.290
How do you feel?

14:00.923 --> 14:01.923
Better.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.258
Good job, Nate.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.011
That sound is a derivation
of an old eskimo word

14:09.182 --> 14:11.548
that mothers used to calm
their children.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.887
I see. Eskimos seem nice.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.769
- They do.
- I think eskimos are smug.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.349
Hold that thought, Chuck.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.564
So, Dave...

14:21.110 --> 14:22.566
Tell us about yourself.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.737
Who are you?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.109
Well, I am an executive assistant...

14:27.283 --> 14:29.615
At a major pet products company.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.741
I don't want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.831
All right.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.038
I'm a pretty good guy.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.162
I like playing tennis on occasion...

14:43.383 --> 14:46.546
Also, not your hobbies, Dave,
just simple:

14:46.719 --> 14:48.255
Tell us who you are.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.879
I just...

14:52.100 --> 14:56.264
Maybe you could give me an example
of what a good answer would be.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.552
What did you say?

14:58.648 --> 15:01.014
You want Lou to tell you who you are?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.980
No, I just...

15:07.365 --> 15:10.198
I'm a nice, easygoing man.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.656
I might be a little bit
indecisive at times.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.163
Dave, you're describing
your personality.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.664
I want to know. _

15:19.502 --> 15:22.619
- Who you are.
- What the hell do you want me to say?

15:28.010 --> 15:31.377
I mean, I'm sorry. I just...
I want to answer your question.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.673
I'm just not doing it right, I guess.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.639
I think we're getting a picture, Dave.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.725
- Let's move on.
- Dr. Rydell, I'd like to know something.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.060
Why is it that Chuck
thinks he can smoke?

15:44.235 --> 15:47.853
I do whatever I want when I want,
you little Spanish fruit topping.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.863
Honey, at least I didn't
make my aunt pregnant.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.698
What are you laughing at, Dave?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.582
Just laughing. I don't know.
I'm not laughing at you.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.869
Were you laughing with me?
Because I'm not laughing.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.248
Am I out of line,
or is this guy pushing me?

16:09.051 --> 16:11.042
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?

16:11.220 --> 16:15.259
I went from happy to angry, skipped
sad. Now I feel like kicking his ass.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.094
Then we'll see who's laughing.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.726
What? Think you're better than me
because you've got both your nuts?

16:21.481 --> 16:25.144
All right, man. All right. Come on.
Come on, big boy. Pretty boy.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.900
All right. Is it worth going back
to the penitentiary, Chuck?

16:31.073 --> 16:34.315
- So he's laughing at you.
- I'm not laughing at him.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.780
(Soosfraba.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.916
- Goosfraba.
- Okay.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.628
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.714
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.492
Where's the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.258
I haven't been to the actors studio
in quite some time.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.344
- I'm sure your audition will go well.
- Thanks. I hope so.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.728
- Good night.
- All right.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.137
- Thanks, buddy.
- Bye-bye.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.602
That was a little bit insane.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.940
If I had to do 20 hours of that,
I'd end up killing myself.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.147
Here you go.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.281
Twenty hours in my class
would be pointless for you.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.698
I agree.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.444
I think I'm going to recommend
to the court that we double your time.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.280
What do you mean?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.993
Let me explain something.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.953
There are two kinds of angry people:
Explosive and implosive.

17:28.339 --> 17:32.173
Explosive is the kind of individual that
you see screaming at the cashier...

17:32.343 --> 17:34.254
For not taking their coupons.

17:34.512 --> 17:39.131
Implosive is the cashier
who remains quiet, day after day...

17:39.350 --> 17:42.808
And finally shoots everyone
in the store.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.765
You're the cashier.

17:44.939 --> 17:49.683
No. I'm the guy hiding in the frozen
food section dialling 911, I swear.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.977
I'm going to assign you
an anger ally...

17:52.196 --> 17:54.687
To help calm you down
when you're losing it.

17:54.991 --> 17:55.991
Chuck.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.984
Not Chuck. Give me the sports guy,
or the porno girls.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.947
Heard we're partnering up, huh?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.737
- Yes.
- Here's my number.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.494
Great. "You're going to die, bitch."

18:05.876 --> 18:08.538
Oops, that's a letter I'm writing
to my father.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.789
That's the number. Good. Thank you.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.461
Dave and Chuck.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.923
Working together as a team.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.640
- It's a win-win situation.
- Yeah, feels it.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.645
Dave's particulars.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.681
I'll see you soon.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.483
The yanks are great this season.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.073
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's
win record.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.664
Remember at brown when we
saw Ron guidry win his 20th?

18:46.876 --> 18:48.662
Oh, man. He was on fire that year.

18:48.878 --> 18:49.993
We could've been too.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.454
Andrew, don't start or I can't
hang out with you anymore.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.875
Sorry, it's just hard. I'll never meet
anyone as good as you.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.590
You will. She'll be a very lucky lady.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.380
Thanks for being my best friend.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.432
I inda.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.764
Hey, Dave. Andrew.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.561
Good to see you guys hugging.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.390
How was the doctor?

19:13.069 --> 19:14.479
Psychotic.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.403
I wasn't able to talk to him
about that yet, but I will.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.737
Not that crowded here.
You'd think it would be packed.

19:25.915 --> 19:30.079
I rented the place. I figured it'd be
more fun if it was just brown alumni.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.538
Where'd you go to college again?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.419
Trenton community college.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.834
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.756
Later, Andrew.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.048
Once you cast your line in,
so during retrieval...

19:45.226 --> 19:48.138
It ni help you to create a realistic
and erratic.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.763
Hey, Dave.

19:51.982 --> 19:55.645
- Hey. Andrew, what's up?
- Not much

19:56.070 --> 19:58.436
you always try to simulate live batt.

19:58.656 --> 20:03.150
Okay, they got fishing while you
go to the bathroom. That's nice.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.530
Yep. Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.116
Be aware of your presentation...

20:08.290 --> 20:11.999
And make sure that,
as you work it along...

20:12.378 --> 20:13.458
Oh, yeah.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.747
Congratulations.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.632
Now that is a big one, folks.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.465
Always a blast being with your friends.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.100
It was a great night.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.262
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.606
Yeah, you like those foot-long
hot dogs, don't you?

20:36.652 --> 20:41.521
So I saw your boy Andrew
at the urinal

20:41.991 --> 20:43.356
saw his.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.320
- Thing.
- You were looking?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.201
Yeah, unfortunately.

20:48.456 --> 20:52.950
So, now, did this guy grow up near
a nuclear power plant or something?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.830
What are you talking about?

20:55.004 --> 20:59.464
Never really seen nothing like that
before. Didn't it use to scare you?

20:59.633 --> 21:00.793
I never saw it.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.716
You never saw it?

21:02.887 --> 21:06.345
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.756
No no no. No.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.514
It's actually quite petite.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.804
I felt bad for him.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.474
It looked like it belonged on a baby
and it had a funny colour.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.311
I bet he got a lot of snickers
in the locker room.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.487
Like, "what the hell's that thing?"

21:24.658 --> 21:27.991
When you're in a locker room,
you must feel good about yourself.

21:28.162 --> 21:32.952
I do. If there are 20 naked guys
in there, I'm usually in the top 18.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.832
- Which isn't bad.
- You're doing really good.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.243
Thanks.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.842
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Let me get rid of them.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.672
- Hello?
- Dave, it's me, Chuck.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.391
- Who's Chuck?
- Your anger ally.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.426
I'm in a mood, Dave. A bad mood.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.053
A very bad mood.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.724
I was fired from my ice-cream truck job
today. No more fudgeicles.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.693
- What's an anger ally?
- Who's that?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.030
She making fun of me?

22:05.199 --> 22:07.315
No. That's my girlfriend.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.611
You tell her to put a sock in it because
I need to talk to you right now!

22:12.248 --> 22:14.079
We're a little busy right now.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.407
You're busy? We're all busy, okay?

22:16.585 --> 22:20.203
You come down here before
a black wolf swallows my brain!

22:29.890 --> 22:33.257
After I got kicked out of the army,
I went through a real bad time:

22:33.435 --> 22:37.974
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the
ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.265
Finally, my parents said I
had to move out.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.319
I'm guessing that's when you decided
to shack up with your aunt.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.525
Don't get cute, wiseass!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.200
But, yes.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.944
What's with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?

22:53.122 --> 22:57.991
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago
and I kind of gotta get back.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.167
Miss? Excuse me, miss?

23:00.379 --> 23:03.166
Is this
slow and stupid waitress day?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.456
I'm sorry. I be right with you.

23:05.801 --> 23:09.089
Damn, man, reminds me
of these chicks back in the war.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.130
Would give you the old licky-licky,
then fry your banana.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.349
Settle.

23:17.938 --> 23:18.938
Did you see that?

23:19.523 --> 23:23.232
- See what?
- That guy. He just gave me a look.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.227
He didn't give you a look.

23:26.488 --> 23:30.356
And I'm pretty sure I heard him mutter
some kind of anti-semitic remark.

23:31.702 --> 23:32.942
Are you Jewish?

23:33.621 --> 23:36.829
I could be. But, no. Half Irish,
half Italian, half Mexican.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.616
Let's go give those guys some tsuris.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.710
Well, the guy on the left is blind,
Chuck.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.788
I hear you.

23:46.216 --> 23:47.376
He's yours.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.382
No. That's not what I was saying.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.965
Hey. “What the hell?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.720
Got something against guys
with hair?

23:53.891 --> 23:54.891
What's going on?

24:01.190 --> 24:02.771
Don't! Stop it! Stop!

24:02.942 --> 24:05.058
Stop! Goosfraba!

24:05.235 --> 24:06.645
You piece of shit!

24:14.203 --> 24:16.159
Stop it! Stop it!

24:20.125 --> 24:21.581
Welcome back, Mr. buznik.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.787
I see you've managed to brutalize
a cocktail waitress this time.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.965
I guess beating up stewardesses
can get old after a while.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.251
Flight attendant, your honour.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.546
I didn't hit her on purpose,
your honour.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.802
I was being attacked by someone...

24:38.018 --> 24:40.600
And while I was
trying to take away his...

24:40.813 --> 24:42.223
His

24:42.398 --> 24:45.014
trying to take away my cane,
your honour.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.397
You cracked a waitress in the face.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.275
While attempting to steal
a blind man's cane?

24:52.741 --> 24:56.450
Your honour, we're not even sure
how blind this man really is.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.996
Okay. My bad. Moving on.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.419
Happy now, ass-wipe”?

25:07.756 --> 25:11.044
Mr. buznik, I don't know
why you hate women.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.921
Maybe you don't know either...

25:13.137 --> 25:18.131
But I'll let you think about it while
you spend one year in a state prison.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.678
- Isn't that a bit harsh, your honour?
- No!

25:21.437 --> 25:22.437
Okay.

25:25.983 --> 25:29.567
- May I approach, your honour?
- By all means, Dr. Rydell.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.817
Thank you.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.450
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.286
- You look marvellous, Brenda.
- Thank you.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.294
So do you have a take
on this buznik guy?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.171
Is this good or bad?

25:51.759 --> 25:54.341
Well, it's bad that he's
talking to her...

25:54.553 --> 25:56.168
But it's good that...

25:57.514 --> 26:00.176
No, it's bad. It's all bad.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.100
- You think you can help him?
- I think so, your honour.

26:04.354 --> 26:09.314
If I can't, I'll tear him apart
with my bare hands.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.236
Mr. buznik.

26:18.452 --> 26:21.910
Because of the enormous respect
I have for Dr. Rydell...

26:22.081 --> 26:25.039
I'm placing you in his intensive
anger management programme...

26:25.209 --> 26:26.540
For 30 days.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.999
But if you fail to strictly adhere
to the rules of his programme...

26:31.173 --> 26:34.085
You will spend the next year
in state prison.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.847
- Buddy?
- Good evening. Ready to get it on?

26:50.025 --> 26:51.686
Get what on?
What are you doing here?

26:51.860 --> 26:53.270
Well, well, well.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.810
The lair of the rage rhino.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.942
I smell the effluvium
of pain and frustration.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.274
Where should we put my stuff?
“What stuff?

27:00.744 --> 27:03.235
We've got 30 days
to control your anger.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.037
My approach dictates
intense observation.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.083
What better vantage point
than bunkmates?

27:09.837 --> 27:11.953
Put that there, Dan,
thank you very much.

27:12.131 --> 27:17.421
No. No. I'm sorry. Guys, I don't think
you should be moving in with me.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.754
Sit down, Dave.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.051
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.553
You've been deemed
a threat to society.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.184
I believe that radical,
round-the-clock therapy...

27:28.355 --> 27:31.438
Is the only way to effect
a meaningful and positive change...

27:31.608 --> 27:32.723
In your behaviour.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.983
Now we can do it here
or in prison.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.481
- Anything else, Dr. b?
- No thanks, Dan.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.110
We'll install the wiretaps tomorrow.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.284
Wiretaps?

27:41.451 --> 27:43.908
Is this your cd collection? Yes.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.073
Oh, my.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.536
What are you doing?

27:49.710 --> 27:52.918
I don't want you listening
to any angry music.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.874
The carpenters are angry? I mean

27:55.966 --> 27:57.581
don't be naive, Dave.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.843
"Close to you."
"We've only just begun."

28:01.013 --> 28:03.755
Songs of madness and obsession.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.844
Who's going to pay for that”

28:07.019 --> 28:11.934
retard your anger level a few notches
and listen to me. Can you do that?

28:12.399 --> 28:15.186
Yeah it's retarded I'm retarded.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.396
(Ood.

28:17.571 --> 28:21.155
Now then, we need to go over
some ground rules.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.155
My girlfriend got me that.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.286
You're to refrain from violent acts
including verbal assault...

28:31.460 --> 28:32.916
And vulgar hand gestures.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.835
You may not use rage-enhancing
substances

28:36.006 --> 28:39.794
such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol,
crack cocaine

28:39.968 --> 28:42.550
olippy-flippies, jelly stingers,
trick sticks.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.552
Bilng bangs or flying willards.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.757
Also, if you are unable
to stop masturbating...

28:47.935 --> 28:51.393
Please do so without the use
of any pornographic images...

28:51.605 --> 28:55.223
Depicting quote-unquote
"angry sex."

28:55.442 --> 28:58.809
That having been said,
I'm a pretty good guy...

28:58.987 --> 29:01.148
And I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised...

29:01.323 --> 29:03.109
At how much fun we can have.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.652
Jeez, without slippy-flippies or angry
masturbating? How is that possible?

29:07.829 --> 29:11.993
Sarcasm is anger's ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.783
Dave, I got this for you.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.540
It's a wonderfully therapeutic tool.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.543
Record your thoughts on this
whenever you feel angry.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.084
I'm feeling very angry right now...

29:24.263 --> 29:27.346
Because I only have one bed
and no couch.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.922
Not a problem.

29:31.353 --> 29:36.689
In Europe, it's not considered unusual
for three or four men to share a bed.

29:36.984 --> 29:40.351
Yeah, well, that's why I'm
proud to be an American.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.029
By the way...

29:49.746 --> 29:51.828
I like to sleep in the nude.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.071
You hear that frog?

30:30.746 --> 30:31.746
Nope.

30:49.598 --> 30:50.598
What do you want?

30:50.807 --> 30:53.594
I'm just recording your demeanour
upon awakening.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.765
Good to see you got your underwear
back on.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.555
6:307

30:59.733 --> 31:01.644
I don't gotta be up till 7.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.600
You've got to make my breakfast.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.897
Dave, cooking is very relaxing
and therapeutic.

31:08.450 --> 31:11.863
I want two eggs,
over easy and unfertilized...

31:12.079 --> 31:14.411
Wheat toast, dry, and please...

31:14.581 --> 31:16.287
Tell me you've got ketchup.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.494
There's a Denny's down the street.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.124
Not only do they have ketchup...

31:20.295 --> 31:22.786
But they got the angriest waitresses
I've seen.

31:22.964 --> 31:26.297
You could have a blast with
the goosfraba thing down there.

31:26.635 --> 31:27.670
I ame-o.

31:49.866 --> 31:50.901
Your eqgs.

31:59.835 --> 32:03.453
- Holy shit!
- I said over easy!

32:08.885 --> 32:10.250
Now, why did I do that?

32:10.846 --> 32:13.838
Because I refused to spoon with you
last night?

32:15.725 --> 32:19.593
The angry man opens his mouth
and shuts his eyes.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.429
Alpha-bits.

32:22.691 --> 32:26.980
No matter how old I get,
always a culinary delight.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.733
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He's a psycho.

32:31.241 --> 32:34.574
Don't sulk, Dave. Eat. Sit down.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.701
We'll be off to work in a jiffy.

32:37.914 --> 32:42.704
"We'll be off to work." Now, by "we'll,"
I assume you mean just me, right?

32:42.878 --> 32:45.415
Well, I have to join you at work.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.836
Full contact.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.916
That will make me look nuts, buddy,
bringing a shrink to work...

32:51.136 --> 32:53.422
You whipping eggs at people.
I don't know.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.673
You must never be ashamed that you
sought help for yourself, Dave.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.349
It's not a weakness.

33:02.272 --> 33:04.183
I mean, I gotta be there by 9:00.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.436
I don't think we'll make it on time.
You're not even dressed

33:07.611 --> 33:10.603
the talmud says:
"Wherever you look...

33:11.615 --> 33:13.606
There's something to be seen.”

33:14.493 --> 33:15.778
Look, Dave.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.956
What exactly was that all about?
“What?

33:31.134 --> 33:34.797
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?

33:34.971 --> 33:38.805
I'm a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.351
Flustered?

33:43.563 --> 33:46.430
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, man!

33:46.733 --> 33:50.601
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- I need you to unfluster.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.396
My boss is going to go nuts on me
if we're late, so please?

33:54.574 --> 33:56.940
We will proceed when you
are centred.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.449
I'm centred, I'm centred.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.453
There's 10,000 people behind us.
Let's go, crazy man.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.958
What is that? Is that good?

34:07.128 --> 34:08.958
We're going to sing a song.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.964
No. I don't want to sing a song.
I want to go to... I've gotta go.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.291
Here we go.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.178
The magic of Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen sondheim's...

34:18.348 --> 34:21.010
West Side story.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.266
"I feel pretty."

34:25.355 --> 34:27.641
Get this moving.
What the hell's your problem?

34:27.815 --> 34:30.398
Shut your pie-hole!
We're working here!

34:30.819 --> 34:32.059
Wow. Sorry.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.622
Move your ass, dipshit!

35:42.390 --> 35:43.596
Burn in hell

35:58.907 --> 35:59.987
Yes!

36:04.954 --> 36:06.194
You feel stunning.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.579
And entrancing.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.932
You're late.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.516
Yes. There was a little bit
of a tie-up on the bridge.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.682
I didn't ask for a traffic report.
You're always late.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.317
Now is the first time I've been late.
But you're right. I'm sorry.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.648
May I interject?

36:40.115 --> 36:43.573
You were about to say something else
before you said, "I'm sorry."

36:43.743 --> 36:45.734
We mustn't absorb and repress.

36:45.912 --> 36:49.700
- Who's this?
- I'm his anger management therapist.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.122
You're in anger management?

36:53.670 --> 36:56.082
Temporarily, yeah.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.460
Do you remember the flight
to st Louis

36:59.676 --> 37:02.964
that I was on when they had to
turn the plane around?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.925
Yeah, yeah. Because of that unruly
passenger in coach.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.589
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

37:07.767 --> 37:09.974
He doesn't like people
touching his clubs.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.142
Well, that unruly passenger was me.

37:15.316 --> 37:19.810
I got arrested at Kennedy. That's why
I didn't make the next flight.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.737
You said your apartment caught fire.

37:22.907 --> 37:26.024
Dissembling is a common tool
of the anger junkie.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.825
Might I have your first name,
Mr. head? And tell me it isn't dick.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.287
- It's frank.
- Fran.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.286
Isn't that normally a girl's name?

37:39.132 --> 37:40.668
What went on on that flight?

37:41.134 --> 37:44.046
To be honest with you,
it was a mix-up. I...

37:44.220 --> 37:46.677
Jibber jabber. Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.339
Denial. Key, key, key, key, key, key.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.805
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus
out of a flight attendant.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.685
I didn't. You broke her nose.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.847
I broke the cocktail waitress's nose.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.021
I mean, I accidentally did that.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.187
Dave, you have a disease.

38:03.364 --> 38:07.152
Would you apologise if you
were a diabetic? Of course not.

38:07.327 --> 38:11.366
Why do you feel you have to apologise
because you're suffering from t.A.S.?

38:12.457 --> 38:13.457
Tas?

38:13.625 --> 38:15.286
Toxic anger syndrome.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.201
I don't have tas.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.496
He's angry. It's a sickness,
not a crime, Fran.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.130
His name is frank!

38:27.347 --> 38:29.759
No. I'm sorry.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.727
Clothes for cats
isn't really a new idea...

38:44.906 --> 38:48.569
But there was never really a line
made for overweight cats...

38:48.743 --> 38:51.655
Who might feel a little
self-conscious.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.912
About how they look
in certain outfits.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.370
That's why I got the baggy sweater
on him, to cover up his gut.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.377
And the beret to take attention
off his plump head.

39:00.547 --> 39:04.540
Oh, little meatball.
You tie this up tight...

39:04.717 --> 39:07.049
And away goes the chin.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.926
I'm so handsome.

39:12.100 --> 39:15.934
Hey, Dave. This is your office?
Andrew

39:16.104 --> 39:18.595
- what are you doing here?
- I played golf with frank.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.273
He's friends with my dad. We're
members of the same country club.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.560
Really? I've been wanting to play golf
with him a long time.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.694
- Is it awesome there?
- It's nice.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.700
So, anyway, Dave,
how's anger management going?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.118
Who told you about that”?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.784
Linda's my best friend.
There's no secrets between us.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.671
For the love of Mike!
This guy's your girl's best friend?

39:44.841 --> 39:47.708
No. I mean, I like to consider myself
her best friend

39:47.927 --> 39:52.717
but Andrew is her best friend friend,
if that makes any sense.

39:52.891 --> 39:56.008
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.598
I gotta go. Bye.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.145
Well, well, well.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.561
This guy's got quite a basket on him.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.946
Really? I didn't notice that.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.783
Do you really want the love of your life
hanging around with a guy...

40:13.953 --> 40:17.491
Who looks as though he could satisfy
a blue whale?

40:17.999 --> 40:21.036
Well, it's...
I'm doing okay myself, pal.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.827
Maybe it's the way his pants fit him.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.837
What's up?

40:28.343 --> 40:30.925
- This is your young lady?
- That's my Linda.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.177
My, oh, my.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.678
I was toying with the notion
that you were gay...

40:37.852 --> 40:40.218
Because of the kitty-cat clothes,
so forth.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.390
What does she do?

40:42.899 --> 40:46.767
She teaches poetry. Poetry teacher.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.942
I love poetry.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.774
Oh, my, my, my. It's...

40:54.285 --> 40:56.947
Yes, it's a good picture of her.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.951
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a
history of unorthodox techniques.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.959
He's got a dozen lawsuits pending.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.712
So it's not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn't he?

41:08.883 --> 41:09.883
Or a genius.

41:10.051 --> 41:15.546
But if you could prove that he's nuts:
Audiotape, video, picture, whatever...

41:15.723 --> 41:17.259
I'll arrange a hearing.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.600
I gotta go. I think he's coming.

41:31.948 --> 41:35.782
Meatball! You tub of goo,
you scared the hell out of me.

41:41.082 --> 41:45.075
I don't care for the way you've
ironed my shirts, Dave. Try it again.

41:45.253 --> 41:49.292
- I've been very patient with you.
- Beware the fury of the patient man.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.081
- I'm serious!
- Too serious.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.750
(Set undressed.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.006
What did you say?

41:57.432 --> 41:58.512
Take off your clothes.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.265
I've got a stress-reduction technique
to show you.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.348
- It'll be good for you.
- Take off my clothes?

42:04.522 --> 42:06.763
Do you want to see me naked, buddy?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.854
Are you a homophobe, Dave?

42:11.029 --> 42:16.194
No, I'm a pulling-my-penis-out-
in-front-of-you-a-phobe.

42:17.285 --> 42:20.152
I et's take a walk on the wild side.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.625
- What's up, baby?
- Why are we here?

42:35.803 --> 42:37.134
I'm not a homophobe.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.092
My lawyer's gay. His boyfriend is gay.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.757
And are they all aware
that you despise them?

42:43.186 --> 42:45.268
Looking for company, baby?

42:45.438 --> 42:47.269
No. We're not. Thank you.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.101
It's worth 50 bucks

42:49.275 --> 42:54.019
if you get in the back seat with
my friend here and have a little chat.

42:54.197 --> 42:55.937
My pleasure, Mr. eyebrows.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.774
Oh, boy, here we go.

43:02.872 --> 43:05.454
- Hello.
- Hey. Good to see you.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.493
What's your name, baby? Melvin.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.286
His name is David. Don't dissemble.

43:12.465 --> 43:15.832
I'm not dissembling.
That's my Hebrew name.

43:16.010 --> 43:19.343
I'm galaxia. That's my German name.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.840
(Reat.

43:21.015 --> 43:24.257
Where are you from originally,
Hebrew Melvin?

43:24.435 --> 43:25.515
Brooklyn.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.103
What part of Germany
do you hail from?

43:29.273 --> 43:33.858
I'm from a little bavarian village
called lickin zee dickin.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.063
Care to visit?

43:35.571 --> 43:39.735
Actually, I like to spend
most of my time...

43:39.909 --> 43:42.321
In girls without wieners-ville.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.659
I'm more comfortable there.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.991
He's just not used to male intimacy.

43:50.294 --> 43:53.457
Well, that's okay, because I'm a lady.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.204
Oops, no, I'm not.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.383
Whoa! There it is.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.088
I feel like dancing. Dancing.

44:01.889 --> 44:02.889
Oh, my god.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.181
What does this have to do
with anger management?

44:06.352 --> 44:09.936
- Oh, are you an angry boy?
- No_

44:10.106 --> 44:11.687
Do you need some discipline?

44:11.899 --> 44:13.059
No, thank you very...

44:13.234 --> 44:15.395
Oh! Hey! Hey, watch that shit!

44:15.570 --> 44:18.858
Listen, ladies! Gentleman! Lentleman!

44:19.031 --> 44:22.148
I'm not having sex with a she-male!
Relax!

44:22.326 --> 44:24.817
Galaxia, you may
get out of the car now.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.578
Your services are no longer required.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.240
You know what?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.374
You guys are freaks.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.670
Give me the tape recorder.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.420
Come on.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.588
Patient number 135, David buznik...

44:45.766 --> 44:49.554
Has learned the difference between
unhealthy anger and righteous anger.

44:49.729 --> 44:54.268
Thus he has advanced
to the second level of my programme.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.854
Great. Can I go throw up now?

45:02.408 --> 45:04.649
I'm a lady. Oops, no, I'm not.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.569
- Whoa, there it is.
- I feel like dancing.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.951
Wasn't that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton-John.

45:11.125 --> 45:14.959
If she was really ugly
and had huge balls.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.791
But buddy didn't order you
to have sex

45:17.965 --> 45:19.796
I'm getting a call. Please hang on.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.629
- Hello?
- Is buddy there?

45:23.346 --> 45:25.462
No, he's in the shower right now.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.296
This is Becky, his assistant.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.636
Just tell him his mom called
from Boston.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.844
She said she's having
some minor surgery.

45:33.022 --> 45:38.233
It's not serious, but she'll be at Boston
county hospital for the next two days.

45:49.997 --> 45:54.707
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...

45:54.877 --> 45:56.993
And brushing my teeth
at the same time.

45:57.797 --> 45:59.662
It looks really good.

46:02.802 --> 46:03.802
What's the matter?

46:04.136 --> 46:07.754
Your mom. They took her
to the hospital, buddy.

46:08.349 --> 46:09.839
What's wrong with my mother?

46:10.017 --> 46:12.884
She's having surgery.

46:13.062 --> 46:14.142
I'm sorry.

46:14.313 --> 46:17.976
- Is it serious?
- When is surgery not serious?

46:18.317 --> 46:20.729
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.815
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

46:23.990 --> 46:26.982
See what's going on up there.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.526
Yeah. Yeah.
Why don't you just go up there.

46:30.997 --> 46:33.955
Spend some quality time. I'll stay here.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.706
It'll be good for you guys.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.332
Oh, god.

46:42.383 --> 46:46.092
You're all I got, mom.
Please don't leave me.

46:51.767 --> 46:54.554
No more clam chowder.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.058
Buddy...

46:58.232 --> 46:59.688
It was a joke.

47:00.276 --> 47:02.892
I'm sorry.
You don't have to cry anymore.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.770
A joke? Yeah

47:07.033 --> 47:08.739
oh, boy.

47:08.909 --> 47:11.571
A joke. A Jo... I...

47:11.746 --> 47:14.078
I can't believe that I fell for that one.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.992
I really thought my mother
was having surgery.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.916
I'm going to get you back
for that one.

47:26.927 --> 47:30.090
Just so you know,
she really is having surgery.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.140
I thought you said you were joking.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.469
No, the serious part was the joke.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.021
She's having surgery,
but just minor surgery.

47:41.942 --> 47:45.355
Maybe I better get up to Boston...

47:45.571 --> 47:48.779
See what's really going on up there.

47:48.949 --> 47:52.487
Why don't you... 7? You just
shoot up there. I'll be here.

47:56.707 --> 47:57.707
What?

47:58.125 --> 48:01.709
- I can't believe he's making me go.
- How come you guys aren't flying?

48:01.879 --> 48:05.963
Because Dr. cocoa puff said legally
I'm not allowed to get on a plane.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.795
Meanwhile, I've got head up my ass
about that catalogue.

48:08.969 --> 48:11.756
I've got to get it done with nut-boy
in Boston.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.963
Why can't head
write his own catalogue?

48:14.141 --> 48:16.598
Because I've got to earn
that promotion.

48:16.769 --> 48:19.636
You've been doing his job for years.
You should be his...

48:19.814 --> 48:22.726
I'm sorry. I know this is really
stressing you out.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.983
I'm sure that it's going to be over
before you know it.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.316
Yeah, if I don't get caught
popping any jelly stingers.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.481
Well, that's going to be tough!

48:42.169 --> 48:44.251
Oh, god. There he is.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.333
That's him? Yes

48:49.427 --> 48:52.009
what? Oh. Okay, I'll hold that.

48:52.430 --> 48:53.430
My...

48:53.597 --> 48:55.258
The quiet warmth

48:55.433 --> 49:00.177
smouldering beneath the rituals
of hope for familiarity

49:00.354 --> 49:03.187
a coursing underground river

49:03.357 --> 49:06.724
pregnant with the chance currents
of knowledge and love

49:06.902 --> 49:10.190
- what?
- That's my poem! I wrote that.

49:10.364 --> 49:11.604
I know.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.194
That is your poem. I love that poem.

49:14.368 --> 49:16.859
I found it crumpled up
behind the sports pages...

49:17.037 --> 49:19.153
Oh the floor of David's bedroom.

49:20.541 --> 49:24.875
- Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
- Who was great on police woman.

49:25.045 --> 49:29.539
Thank you. And thank you
for rescuing it from the floor.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.292
I think I better get going.

49:34.305 --> 49:37.593
I'll miss you, big guy,
so take good care.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.631
- How about a kiss?
- I'd love a kiss.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.552
I think she's talking to me.
I think I can handle it.

49:42.730 --> 49:45.062
So why don't you back up
an inch or two.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.392
Got it.

49:47.568 --> 49:49.308
Thank you. And, take care.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.569
Have a great trip, you guys.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.070
Oh, we will.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.525
Bye.

50:00.748 --> 50:01.783
What?

50:01.957 --> 50:05.290
Some mindless nitwit
is parked behind me.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.959
Good. Then we can't go.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.710
No, I can get out.

50:08.964 --> 50:11.831
- Get in.
- I don't know how you'll get out.

50:12.343 --> 50:16.052
Try to wiggle out, you're going to get
a ding. But you know everything.

50:21.435 --> 50:22.550
What's he doing?

50:32.488 --> 50:35.901
Another great performance
by the master of anger control.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.363
Now we're bumping into cars.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.200
I'm just making a little room
to back up.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.330
If I had lost my temper...

50:45.501 --> 50:47.833
Would I have had
the presence of mind...

50:48.003 --> 50:50.961
To leave my card
and my insurance information?

50:51.131 --> 50:54.749
Whatever, Mr. insane-vein-popping-
a-little-too-far-out-of-his-head-

50:54.927 --> 50:56.463
\while-swinging-the-bat guy.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.806
I think you've got room to back up.

51:19.577 --> 51:22.364
Why haven't you taken Linda
off the market?

51:22.538 --> 51:23.948
Think you can do better?

51:24.123 --> 51:27.331
I'm going to ask her to marry me
when I'm ready.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.538
Nobody wants to settle down
with a 35-year-old secretary.

51:30.713 --> 51:32.203
Procrastination, Dave.

51:32.381 --> 51:33.837
I'm not procrastinating.

51:34.008 --> 51:36.420
I even think about how I'm
going to pop the question.

51:36.594 --> 51:40.178
Husky down jacket.
Husky eskimo look.

51:40.347 --> 51:44.181
What's your plan,
ask her at a yankee game?

51:45.436 --> 51:47.267
Actually, yes. How did you know?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.850
I said the corniest thing
I could think of

51:50.024 --> 51:52.982
if you knew Linda, you'd know
how uncorny it would be to her.

51:53.152 --> 51:55.859
Putting up a "marry me, please”
on the scoreboard

51:56.030 --> 51:59.363
proclaiming my love for her
in front of thousands of strangers.

52:00.034 --> 52:04.118
As you seem to have noticed, I'm
a little bit jumpy with public affection.

52:04.872 --> 52:07.329
You seemed to be lovey-dovey
back there.

52:08.709 --> 52:11.416
Glad you think that's funny.
I gotta work.

52:28.854 --> 52:31.311
A five-hour trip to find out mommy
had a jelly bean...

52:31.482 --> 52:32.562
Removed from her nose.

52:32.733 --> 52:35.145
I'm glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?

52:53.462 --> 52:55.418
You could have her, you know.

52:57.424 --> 53:00.507
I'm sure she'd love to hang out
with a goofy secretary...

53:00.678 --> 53:03.260
Whose only talent
is nostril wiggling.

53:04.098 --> 53:06.339
- Girls love that.
- Dave

53:06.517 --> 53:10.385
you've got a lot more going for you
than wiggly nostrils.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.346
I want you to go over there
and ask that woman out.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.264
No, I got a girlfriend.

53:16.193 --> 53:20.607
I'm not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.

53:20.781 --> 53:23.739
Flirting is cheating's ugly cousin,
buddy.

53:23.951 --> 53:25.612
I'm not a cheater.

53:25.953 --> 53:29.491
Is it cheating if you're passed around
the cell block like a peace pipe?

53:29.665 --> 53:34.830
Because that is what's on the docket
for you if you don't go and ask her out.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.209
Okay, Dave?

53:37.172 --> 53:38.378
Oh, god.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.464
That's my boy.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.762
Fxcuse me.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.638
I was wondering if I could buy you
a drink. I see that you have a drink...

53:55.816 --> 53:59.183
But I could get you another
when you're through with that one.

54:00.446 --> 54:02.357
Bite me.

54:03.824 --> 54:06.440
Nice meeting you. Okay.

54:10.998 --> 54:13.080
Can you guess why she rejected you?

54:13.250 --> 54:17.493
She wanted to be like the 2000 other
girls who said that to me growing up?

54:17.671 --> 54:20.253
No. Self-hypnotic negative imagery.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.421
Confidence is the key
to winning a young lady's attention.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.260
Now, listen to me very carefully.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.093
- Approach miss thing again.
- No_

54:30.267 --> 54:31.302
With confidence.

54:31.477 --> 54:33.593
And if she says no this time...

54:33.771 --> 54:37.104
I will admit that I am a failure
as a therapist...

54:37.274 --> 54:39.435
And release you from my programme.

54:39.735 --> 54:41.976
You'll release me
from your programme?

54:44.198 --> 54:46.189
Okay.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.700
Just go over there
and repeat the following...

54:54.291 --> 54:55.747
Verbatim:

54:55.918 --> 54:58.375
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

54:58.545 --> 55:01.878
Out it's difficult for me
to express myself...

55:02.049 --> 55:06.042
When I'm on the verge of exploding
in my pants.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.339
- Get out of here.
- Trust me, Dave.

55:12.684 --> 55:16.051
If you are calm as well as witty,
she will respond.

55:16.230 --> 55:19.643
Witty went out the window with
the pants explosion thing, thanks.

55:20.192 --> 55:22.057
My offer stands.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.609
So if I repeat that crazy shit...

55:28.784 --> 55:32.868
You probably stole from
a porno flick, you sick bastard...

55:33.330 --> 55:35.116
And get rejected...

55:35.374 --> 55:37.365
You'll release me
from the programme?

55:38.043 --> 55:39.043
Exactly.

55:39.711 --> 55:41.247
Here we go.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.210
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.

56:11.869 --> 56:16.329
I'm sorry I was so rude before...

56:17.666 --> 56:23.002
But it's difficult for me _.

56:23.922 --> 56:27.710
To express myself...

56:41.315 --> 56:44.307
When I am on the verge...

56:46.862 --> 56:50.150
Of exploding in my pants.

56:53.493 --> 56:56.610
You are too cute.

56:57.331 --> 56:58.787
(Get the fuck out of here.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.492
I'm Kendra. I'm Dave.

57:03.795 --> 57:05.001
Let me buy you a drink.

57:06.465 --> 57:08.330
Can I get a Cosmopolitan?

57:17.017 --> 57:18.678
I couldn't take it anymore...

57:18.894 --> 57:22.182
So finally I just tell my boss:

57:22.439 --> 57:26.478
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you,
I'll squeeze your head."

57:26.985 --> 57:30.819
- I didn't say that, but I should have.
- You are so funny.

57:31.031 --> 57:33.989
Too bad you're leaving town.
We could have fun together.

57:35.369 --> 57:38.031
Unfortunately, I am leaving
in the morning.

57:38.205 --> 57:40.537
In fact, I think I gotta get back
to my friend.

57:48.840 --> 57:49.875
What's the matter?

57:51.176 --> 57:53.383
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What's wrong?

57:53.553 --> 57:55.418
My friend took off on me.

57:55.681 --> 57:57.512
I can give you a ride.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.597
I don't even know where the guy lives.

57:59.768 --> 58:02.805
We can hang out at my place until you
get in touch with him.

58:10.237 --> 58:12.899
I bet there's like 50 rydells in here.

58:13.115 --> 58:15.481
I shouldn't eat this. I'm getting so fat.

58:15.784 --> 58:17.399
What? You're not fat

58:17.577 --> 58:20.364
my clothes hide it, but I'm
getting gooey right here.

58:20.622 --> 58:22.112
I don't see any goo.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.827
You want to see goo,
I'll show you my ass.

58:25.002 --> 58:28.039
Well, I see it,
and I didn't five years ago.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.080
I went out with this guy,
and he wouldn't sleep with me.

58:31.258 --> 58:35.251
And I asked him why, and he said that
when he saw me without my clothes...

58:36.138 --> 58:37.924
That I look like a porker.

58:38.098 --> 58:41.636
He was probably just nervous
because you're beautiful and...

58:41.977 --> 58:45.014
Anyways, you're not a porker.
You're the un-porker.

58:45.188 --> 58:47.053
You're sizzlean

58:49.901 --> 58:53.439
- you're so sweet, Dave.
- Well, you're sweet, Kendra.

58:53.613 --> 58:57.652
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.

58:57.826 --> 58:59.282
Rose.

59:00.787 --> 59:03.620
Rose Rydell. Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.997
Rose Rydell! I got it!

59:10.630 --> 59:11.630
Kendra.

59:12.758 --> 59:15.921
Even though I'd love to see you
take that bra off.

59:16.136 --> 59:20.470
Because it represents a team
I've hated my entire life...

59:20.849 --> 59:22.931
I think you gotta keep it on.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.181
Why?

59:25.103 --> 59:27.469
Because I got a girlfriend.

59:30.150 --> 59:32.266
I'm not a child, Dave.

59:32.486 --> 59:35.819
If you think I'm a porker,
then just come right out and say it.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.729
No. I don't think you're a porker.

59:37.908 --> 59:40.650
Then why when the idea of sleeping
with me comes up...

59:40.827 --> 59:43.159
Do you all of a sudden
have a "girlfriend"?

59:43.330 --> 59:45.992
Because I do. I do. I have a girlfriend.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.997
Said the liar to the beached whale!

59:48.168 --> 59:49.533
You're not a beached whale.

59:49.711 --> 59:52.077
If anything, you could even
gain a few pounds.

59:53.173 --> 59:55.664
So now I'm too skinny for you?

59:55.842 --> 59:57.207
No I didn't mean that.

59:57.385 --> 01:00:00.422
- Is this what you want, Dave?
- No_

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:06.137
Will you be able to stifle your vomit
long enough to have sex with me?!

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.930
Holy shit.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:11.393
Are you such a hot stud
that you'll break me in two?!

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.808
You're angry right now. Wanna sing?
Do you know "I feel pretty"?

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.361
- Get out! Get out!
- Stop!

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:19.692
(Set out!

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.652
(Set out!

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.533
Porker!

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:24.745
Fatty!

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.571
No!

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.092
How did it go, pal?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.388
- Why'd you ditch me?
- What are you talking about?

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.095
You gave me the signal.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:49.385
I didn't give you the signal to leave.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:53.181
I gave you the signal to say your
gross pickup line actually worked.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.269
Well, of course it did.

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:59.107
So did little Davey need
some anger management?

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.647
That chick was killer.
Serial killer.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:04.282
She tried to chocolate me to death

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.534
anyways, I don't cheat on Linda.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:11.073
- Speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
- Oh, yeah?

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:14.584
She seemed a little bit
bent out of shape.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:18.121
- About what?
- Your being out with another woman.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.337
- How would she know that?
- I told her.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.843
- What else could I do?
- What else could you do?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:28.508
You could've told her something else.
I was at the bank. I was at the store.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.597
I ate bad guacamole
and I couldn't stop shitting!

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.602
Any of those would have been fine!

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.849
Well, I'm sorry, Dave,
but I don't lie for my patients.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:40.565
You want to leave your friend and
run off and chase some hot babe

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.778
you can't expect me to cover for you.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.656
I did what you told me to do,
you sick, demented man.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.779
What are you laughing at?

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.323
What's so funny?

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:59.793
Kendra is an ex-patient of mine,
an actress. Pretty good one too.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:04.460
I arranged for her to be in the bar
and for you to pick her up.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:09.548
You were messing with me?

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:12.468
Yeah. You know, just a joke
between friends

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.979
likke the one you pulled on me
about my dying mother.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.481
I told you I'd get you back for that.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:20.653
All right.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.406
So you really didn't talk to Linda.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:30.152
Of course I did.
That's what made it so funny.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.368
Where's your phone?

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:38.869
She's not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:41.663
She doesn't know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:46.505
Yeah, that's it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.212
"The testicle with legs.” great!

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:53.009
Now wait a minute. Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:56.144
Maybe just hum a little "I feel pretty."

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:59.848
No! How about you hum
the "I'm a crazy asshole" song?

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.768
And take me home,
you psychotic piece of wacko.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.188
I never thought you'd take it like this.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:20.706
So, what, we're not going to talk at all”?

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:27.501
Would you forgive me if I told you
I called Linda last night...

01:03:27.762 --> 01:03:31.346
After our little fracas
and explained that it was my fault?

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:32.725
What did she say?

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:38.224
Well, she's not mad at you anymore,
but she let me have it pretty good.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.514
You deserved it. I did nothing wrong.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:42.353
I know. I know.

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.195
Friends?

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:47.114
Yeah.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.899
- Take a little nap.
- I am tired.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.908
Well, you had a rough night.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.257
Stop with the cupcake!

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.721
Rise and shine, sir snoozola.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.514
What's going on? Where are we?

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:18.472
Well, at a great deal of expense
and effort

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:22.264
we have managed to locate
your grade school béte noire...

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.442
Arnie Shankman.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.773
We do desire a confrontation with him,
do we not?

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:30.780
What? Do you mean the kid
who bullied me in fifth grade?

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:34.943
Dave, I think it's pivotal for you
to confront your childhood Nemesis.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:38.826
Remember, for 22 more days,
you are mine.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.454
This is where Arnie Shankman lives?

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:49.750
You're kidding me. You're going to
make me confront a monk.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.256
(Reat.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.977
Are you ashamed that you
never stood up to him?

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.978
No. He was just a kid lashing out...

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.686
Because his sister got sent
to an insane asylum.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.442
I'm surprised your research
didn't tell you that.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:10.941
This doesn't look like him.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.109
Excuse me, Arnie Shankman?

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.992
Sorry about waking you up.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:23.158
My name is pana kamanana...

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:26.833
But, yes, I was once known
as Arnie Shankman.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.333
Arnie.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.999
Pana kamanana

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.676
Dave buznik
from elementary school.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.051
David buznik.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.342
This is the last place I thought
I'd find you, a monastery.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.104
You could say I've gone through
a rather dramatic transformation.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.515
Could you excuse him for a second,
peanuts?

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.769
His name's not peanuts.
It's pana manapia.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.360
You want me to fight a monk?
He's not even allowed to hurt a plant.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:57.992
For Pete's sake, this is the monk
that twisted your tits!

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.575
Confront him or you're going to prison!

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:03.369
All right. All right. All right.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.128
Anyways, what I wanted to
say to you was...

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:16.674
When we were kids, you kind of
bullied me around a little bit.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:21.217
And I never really did anything
to deserve that kind of treatment.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:24.015
Of course not. I was a real cretin then.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.555
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:30.100
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.020
You pulled my gym shorts down
in front of Sara plowman.

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:37.232
That actually was pretty funny.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.901
Jeez, I don't think that it was.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.287
Now, come, David.
Humour is the spice of life.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.497
The look on your face was priceless.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:48.581
"Oh! Sara saw my pee-pee!”

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.338
So pena likes the spicy humour.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:56.502
Maybe he'd enjoy the knee-slapper
you told me about the great Buddha.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.215
What did you say about Buddha?

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:02.007
Dave said, "how does a guy
who weighs over 600 pounds...

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.302
Have the balls to teach people
about self-discipline?"

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:08.312
Let's not make fun of my god, here.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:12.067
You know what else Dave finds
particularly piquant?

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:15.862
Recalling your nut-job sister
struggling with her underpants...

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.112
In a straitjacket.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.614
You think that's funny?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.867
Dave used to con her
into getting naked...

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:23.779
By saying that her clothes
had ghosts in them.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.288
That never happened.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.449
Then he'd pull out his winkie
and tell her.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.289
It was a strawberry ice-cream cone.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:34.126
Is that what you've come here
to tell me?

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.133
Did you expose yourself...

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.634
To my sister?

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.298
No

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.974
- And don't shove me again.
- It's shower-room humiliation again.

01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:48.636
He's giving you a wet Willie and
making you chew on his jockstrap...

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.726
And fart blossom and all this.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:55.853
Answer me, buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.648
Over and over again.

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:03.986
And she moaned like a wildebeest.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.119
Wildebeest

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.291
whoo! Now, that felt good!

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:13.544
I wasn't expecting that
from a Buddhist.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:18.332
- I'm a little pissed off right now.
- You all right? You're all right.

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:25.924
David! David! No, David!

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.716
Easy, boy!

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.260
Sorry.

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:31.515
Help me, brother.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:34.314
- Help me.
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:37.273
Okay, we're even. We're even now.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.067
- I went crazy. I'm so sorry.
- I started it.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:41.777
- I started it.
- It's all right.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.691
And I'm gonna finish it!

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.952
Now we're even, butt-lick!

01:08:47.332 --> 01:08:49.323
No! Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.209
"What's that, auntie em?
It's a twister!"

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.040
My nipples!

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.830
Pena! Look! Your sister's back.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.375
I got Casper in my clothes!

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.886
- Pretty good.
- Thanks, baby.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.058
I'll kill you!

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.929
You want that rake?

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:11.719
You can't get that rake from me!

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.388
Look, everybody!

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.522
Pana banana's got a heinie.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:18.020
- He's got a heinie!
- I give!

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.902
- I give!
- All right. I'm sorry.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:23.523
Friends? You suck!

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.578
Shankman!

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:30.238
Wedgie! Wedgie! Wedgie!

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.573
- I've seen enough.
- Hold it right there.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:34.959
This party's by invitation only.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.131
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.508
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:57.766
Hold it back there! Come on, come on.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:58.979
Start the car!

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:01.269
Go! Go! Go! Come on, let's go!

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.529
Now! Now! Now! Now!

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.658
Oh, boy!

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.664
We were like butch and Sundance!

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:17.293
Oh, my god! I thought you
were going to shoot somebody!

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.467
You really threw me some curves
back there, kid.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.344
I never expected it to go that way.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:30.514
But you kicked some serious
monk ass there, baby.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.391
You're damn right, baby!

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:36.137
- How did it feel?
- I feel good! I feel incredible!

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:40.475
I feel bad about molesting his sister
all those times, but it's all right!

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.233
- You really molested a crazy girl?
- No. Got you.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.990
Congratulations, keed,
you've reached level three.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.871
I would never have done anything
with that girl.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:11:02.584
Don't worry. Dr. Rydell explained
everything to me, and I get it.

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:07.844
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting
fact about me being a procrastinator...

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:11.222
And I was going to wait
for a yankee game to do this...

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.598
But.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:16.845
I don't know. I... it's something
I wanted to say to you...

01:11:17.023 --> 01:11:20.766
And I'm having a hard time saying it
for some reason. But

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:27.196
it's just that monks, they talk shit...

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.152
But they can't back it up.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.829
That's what was so hard
to say to me?

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.330
Yeah.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.881
You know, when I was on the phone
with buddy, he gave me some advice.

01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:48.964
That's great.
His advice is a little cuckoo.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.087
But somehow it works.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:54.428
Well, then I guess I'll just do
what he suggested.

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:01.063
I don't think that we should
see each other for a while.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:06.152
Buddy thinks that a trial separation
will ultimately...

01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:09.405
Strengthen our relationship.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.748
I play tennis, you dumb-ass!

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.910
I think we're gonna need another
session or two, Johnny Mac.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:25.000
- You're back in the group.
- Doc, are you insane?

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.039
You said I was out. You're in!

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.253
- In! I'm changing the call!
- This is ridiculous!

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:34.922
- What kind of stupid call is that?
- This is not the Davis cup, John.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:38.389
This is group therapy. Now go take
a fury fighter's nap, all right?

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:40.724
- Don't gnash your teeth.
- Sorry.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:44.265
What keys do we need to possess
before we can...?

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:45.774
Dave you're late

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.903
- can I talk to you alone, please?
- Sure you can...

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.617
You told Linda we should have
a trial separation?

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.121
Yes. Yes?!

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.619
Yes!

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.415
Separating from Linda
is a crucial part of our strategy.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.800
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:14.258
All right. Strictly as a friend.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.469
Linda's been thinking about
leaving you for some time.

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:21.310
She loves you, but she
recognises you're a neurotic mess.

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:22.606
You're jealous...

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.982
Self-loathing, resentful, insecure
and a premature ejaculator.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.561
She told you I was
a premature ejaculator?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.104
That part I was assuming.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.027
I haven't done that in,
like, eight months.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:39.662
Anyway, a trial separation will make
you both gain a deeper appreciation...

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.998
For David buznik.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:46.669
After she dates a couple of losers,
she'll be begging you to take her back.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:55.970
So I've been thinking about it,
Linda

01:13:56.265 --> 01:14:00.759
and a trial separation is exactly
what we need.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:04.015
And if you want to start seeing...

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.980
Other penises... people...

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.688
You sound upset. Are you all right?

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:20.870
I'm fine. Just date anybody you'd like.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.951
And don't hold back, okay?

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:27.373
Because there's a lot of nice guys
out there and I'm cool with it.

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.127
I'll be strong.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.593
So the guy asked me for change.
I laughed. He cursed.

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:36.843
I whizzed on him.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.681
What else could I do, huh?
You should've tossed a rock at him.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:44.135
That's your solution for everything.
The guy's homeless, right?

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.137
Let him be. Set your anger free.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:50.562
Look at you, Lou. You've really calmed
down since working with Dr. b.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:52.647
- We all have.
- Hey, fellas.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:55.321
Could you bring it down a little bit?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.324
We're trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.236
This is a free country!
What's going on with you?!

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.700
- Are you crazy?!
- Go in! Just go in.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.707
(Soosfraba! Goosfrabal

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.915
(soosfraba.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:13.752
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.258
I need to see dr b. I'm in crisis.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.091
He's not here.
Why don't you go look for him?

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:23.725
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by
and she dropped these off for you.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.349
Those are her keys to my apartment.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.764
I think your girlfriend's cheating
on you.

01:15:30.109 --> 01:15:32.771
- Why?
- I heard her on her cell phone...

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.606
Talking to a guy...

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:38.402
- Making a date.
- I'm so sorry, Dave.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.240
Andrew.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.659
I'll kill that guy.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:46.580
She ain't cheating on me, by the way.
We agreed to take a break.

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:50.164
She's not taking a break
from the old sausage, huh?

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:51.911
Sorry.

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:54.831
She's meeting the Andrew at mort's
on 86th street now

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.294
if you want to go watch.

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:00.636
No. No, I can't do that.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.095
Dave

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.270
we're here.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:11.018
- Both of you showed up?
- You like Stacy better or something?

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:15.356
It's just that I want to go on a fake
date to get my girlfriend jealous...

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:17.770
So I really only needed
one of you guys.

01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:19.813
Well, now she'll be twice as jealous.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:23.200
- So do you know the guy she's with?
- I think I might.

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.655
Let me ask you something.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:29.039
Because of your profession
you probably have seen a lot of them.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:33.544
Does size count at all, or is that just
some weird thing guys think about?

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.581
This is where Gina and I
always get into a heated debate.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.590
I like them when they're really big.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:41.468
And I think it's better
when they're enormous.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:49.931
Good evening.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:52.222
Table for three?

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:55.266
- May we take your coats?
- No. We're okay.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.776
The girls are gonna
take their coats off

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.108
would you like a boobs...? Booth?

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:07.911
Actually, could you give us a table
overlooking that table right there?

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.038
- Sure. Right this way.
- Thank you.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.833
Oh, my god. It's Stacy and Gina.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:18.372
Who?

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:20.087
Nobody.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.543
I'm so hungry I could eat you, Dave.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.378
Yummy. Yummy.

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:28.220
- Let's get wasted tonight.
- Definitely.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:31.557
Have fun. Lucky son of a bitch.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.643
What?

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.359
I can't believe this.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:40.861
Fxcuse me.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:45.695
Linda. I'm a little embarrassed. I
didn't know you were going to be here.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:48.243
I guess not. Are those your friends?

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:52.282
I'm supposed to date other people
so I figured I'd give it a try.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:18:00.247
Gina, can you stop sucking
on Stacy's finger for one second?

01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:02.587
I want to introduce you to somebody.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:06.592
- Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
- Nice to meet you.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.427
And I'd like you to meet my date.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.761
Ladies, this is buddy Rydell.

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:16.056
- Look, Dave, it's buddy.
- I see.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:19.145
- You know Stacy and Gina?
- Yes, yes, I do.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:22.062
We're in Dave's anger group.
Fury fighters!

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:26.273
Well, gee whiz.
Here's your rémy, Linda.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.408
This is a bit awkward.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.115
I mean, group members...

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.746
Are not supposed to get
romantically involved.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.829
Yeah! I agree with that.
You know that

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:39.120
I'd like to talk to you alone
for a second.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:43.007
There's a rage control technique I'd
like to go over with you right now.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.838
Of course. Excuse me...

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:47.427
What?

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:51.890
- Two of the usual, Duke.
- Coming right up, Dr. b.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.803
You're the biggest backstabbing
piece of crap I ever met.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.016
What are you saying?

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:59.432
I'm trying to give you a hand.
It's my job.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:02.226
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.778
My job is trying to prevent
mr Andrew

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:07.861
from unleashing the whopper
with cheese.

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:11.076
That's right. Since you've
been out of the picture...

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:13.989
Andrew's been burning up the wires
night and day...

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.704
Trying to rekindle those
hotsie-totsie nights up at brown u.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.745
- How would you know?
- You think I only tapped your phone?

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:22.421
What was she saying?

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:26.376
The good news is, I already launched
a preemptive strike.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:29.386
Now the situation is contained.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:31.547
You and I control the game.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:32.809
How?

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:36.310
I will be uncharacteristically
aggressively boring.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.519
I keep talking about myself,
acting arrogant and obnoxious.

01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:43.560
When Linda sees what
the dating world is really like...

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:47.400
Then guess who comes out
smelling like a white mushroom?

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:54.741
- You swear to me this will work?
- The ball's already up in the air.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:57.915
Incidentally, nice move
bringing the girls.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:01.577
Very strong. Come on.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.462
I'll see you at home
in a half-hour, keed.

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.506
That's 25 dollars, pal.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.428
We don't

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.335
Where were you? It's 1:00.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:51.752
When you hear what happened, you'll
bow down and worship me like a god.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.046
- Better be good. Give it to me.
- Okay.

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:57.261
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus...

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.018
The bus”? You took the bus?
What happened to your car?

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.804
I was way too smashed to drive.

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:07.318
I told her I didn't want to waste money
on a cab. That did not go down well.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.770
Okay. I like that.

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:12.109
So we get to her house...

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:15.614
We have some kind of
a weird argument...

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:19.121
About the number of syllables
in a haiku.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:20.656
Poetry garbage.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:24.247
She said it was getting late,
we kissed and I headed on home.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.130
Now, you say you kissed?

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.962
It was nothing. Little five-second kiss.
That's all.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:32.626
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.379
You're having this horrible evening.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.970
- How do you end up kissing, again?
- I wish I knew, keed.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.760
We were both pretty geezed up.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.893
One second we're fighting,
and the next second we're laughing...

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.400
And then just a quick
10-second kiss.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.027
I thought that you said five seconds.

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:52.859
First it was a five-second one.

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:56.400
And then a little break because
my beard gave her a tickle.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.782
She's cute.
And then a 10-second frencher.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:05.000
You had your crazy, corroded tongue
in my girlfriend's mouth?

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:09.542
Just a second. Just one second, Dave.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.500
Dr. b, let it bip.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:15.260
Well, hello.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:19.423
I shouldn't really talk right now.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.764
Well, I suppose you're right.

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.020
It's got to be done.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.849
Who was that? Linda?

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.193
Dave

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:37.115
I've got some good news for you
and some potentially upsetting news.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.117
First, the good news.

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:41.870
I'm going to sign your papers.
You're a free man.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.372
Let me hear
the potentially upsetting news.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:49.036
Linda and I have fallen
for one another.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.624
Pretty hard too.

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.049
David, I hope you believe me
when I say this:

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.050
I didn't intend for this to happen.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.963
It was no one's fault, I guess.
It was just...

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.722
Wait a minute.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.724
I figured this out.

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.149
You're messing with me.

01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:17.572
I wish I were, Dave.

01:23:18.076 --> 01:23:22.911
However, I did insist that we not
go forward without your blessing...

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:27.996
Because we're best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?

01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:31.420
Is it all right if I date your ex?

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.425
Welcome back, Mr. buznik.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:40.258
I am appalled by your assault
on Dr. Rydell.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:43.799
Obviously, anger management
has been a complete failure for you.

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:51.894
As for Dr. Rydell's safety,
I'm issuing a restraining order.

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:55.402
Which means that at no time can you
come within 500 feet of him...

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.938
Or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.822
Court is adjourned.

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:20.585
Coming, peaches.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:30.895
Are you kidding me?

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.692
Numb-nuts, where's the catalogue
for my fat cat clothing line?

01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:41.322
I said I'd have it by 3.

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:45.160
- Okay.
- Get in gear.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.244
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:53.081
I hope you have it.
My presentation's in two hours.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:56.338
What's this? Your fat-shit cat's
been sitting there all day.

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.043
Don't worry about him.

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:01.130
Here you go.
I think you're gonna like it.

01:25:08.562 --> 01:25:09.597
It's good stuff.

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:12.346
That's a good picture, I think.

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:15.523
What the hell is this?!

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:18.731
You keep telling everybody you
created the husky cat line.

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:21.401
I thought you'd want your picture
in there. No?

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:23.861
Question: Can I get two couches
in my office?

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.698
If friends come over,
I want them to feel comfortable.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:27.907
What office?

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:32.450
Frank was nice enough to give me
some creative executive position.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.337
- You gave him the job that I wanted?
- He earned it

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:39.964
why can't you be happy for me?
Linda's gonna be.

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.005
Know something?
I'm sick of you hanging out with Linda.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.671
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:47.214
I wouldn't worry about me.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:50.600
It's your pal buddy who's taking her
to the yankee game tonight.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:52.806
Yankee game.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.227
Did he steal my proposal idea?

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:59.564
Buznik, your behaviour
is unacceptable.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.570
Unacceptable?

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:08.235
I've been getting your coffee and
doing your work for five years now.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.574
When a good position
actually opens up...

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:13.203
You give it to the biggest dick
in the world?

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:17.290
I don't know about the world, but it's
definitely the biggest one in the room.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.336
Now, when I started here...

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:24.509
I was promised advancement
opportunities.

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:27.838
And breaking that promise, to me,
is unacceptable.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:32.760
You see? I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:37.268
So when I get out of jail, sometime
in the next two to five years...

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:42.152
I expect you to give me the position
that Andrew just resigned from.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:45.105
- Okay.
- Great

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:47.441
have fun looking like colonel klink.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:53.660
By the way, his name is not
fat-shit cat, it's meatball...

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:56.496
And he's eating your crab cakes
right now.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:06.335
- You starting to get excited?
- Are you kidding? I'm out of my mind.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.174
This is going to be some night.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.757
Come on. Come on.

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:25.820
- Dr. b, how's it going?
- Very well, thank you.

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:28.482
Always a thrill. Right this way.

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:33.782
Where the hell's a spot?
Where's a spot?

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.163
Whoa! Watch it, man!

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:36.368
Your attention, please.

01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.957
Your attention, please.

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:39.959
Before tonight's national anthem...

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:43.167
Metropolitan opera star
Robert merrill.

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:48.131
Will present a special moment
for two special people.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.337
I love when they do this.

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:55.058
- Good.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Robert merrill.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.359
Linda?! Lindal

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:21.535
I indal

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.217
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.632
Wait, don't I know you?

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.722
Come on.
Where's your German accent?

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:44.349
You have me confused
with somebody...

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:47.190
I wanna get on the field.
I'm a fan of Mr. merrill's.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.980
- There's no fans allowed on that field.
- Galaxia.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:52.076
It's Gary.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:55.907
Whatever. Someone else will marry
my woman if you don't let me go.

01:28:57.415 --> 01:29:00.498
- Hebrew Melvin's in love.
- Very much.

01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.169
I can't stop love.

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:06.162
- Go.
- Thank you.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:10.918
Don't think I don't owe you
a couple smacks, by the way.

01:29:12.055 --> 01:29:15.798
Good evening. Tonight, romance
comes to yankee stadium.

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.435
Oh, my god, it's Dave.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.770
What the heck are you doing here?

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:25.440
- I wanna borrow this for a second.
- That's my Mike!

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.100
Linda”? Where are you?

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:29.110
Don't move.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:32.022
Linda”? Are you out there, honey?

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:35.609
Linda, I'm not mad at you.

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:40.034
Oh, shit.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.618
I know that crazy man
brought you here.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.705
Davey's going crazy!

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:51.717
I've done crazier stuff than that
to win back a chick.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:53.969
Once I ran naked
through a subway station.

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:55.549
How was that supposed to work?

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.469
I guess I never really
thought it through.

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:02.560
I gotta tell you something personal!

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:05.396
This kid lost his marbles.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.850
I'm over here!

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:13.822
Linda, think about
what you're doing to us.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:17.984
Sweet tackle.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.074
Dave just got levelled!

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.658
- Nobody messes with my microphone.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:26.334
Bob?

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:29.746
- Everything all right, buddy?
- Oh, yeah.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:31.665
I've never seen you so excited.

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:34.630
It's not every day a man
gets to propose marriage...

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:36.340
To the woman he loves.

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:39.347
Now, here's what I want you to write
on the scoreboard.

01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:43.351
Linda! Linda, I've loved you
since the day I met you!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:45.682
I won't let you do this to us!

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.973
Don't marry him!

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:50.775
Don't marry him!

01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:57.732
Let this man finish
what he came here to say.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:30:59.526
[I eft the man back in.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:02.946
- Who was that guy?
- I think it's Bill Clinton.

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:08.665
Thank you, mayor giuliani.
You're the man, by the way.

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:13.377
This clown better hurry up.
My arm's starting to ice over.

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:16.042
Chill, rocket. Goosfraba.

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:17.586
(Soosfraba.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.346
(Soosfraba.

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:26.929
I can understand why you wanted
to see other people. I really can.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:29.890
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:32.734
But he was right about one thing.

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:36.021
I was an angry guy.

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:38.735
Mainly angry at myself...

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:41.947
For letting people treat me like crap
all the time.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.905
But I don't want to be
that angry guy anymore.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:46.448
I wanna change.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:48.124
If you give me a chance...

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:52.128
I can show you that I got the guts
to stand up for what I believe in.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:53.959
And I believe in us, Linda.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:58.343
I love you with all my heart,
and I know you love me back.

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:00.928
I should be your husband...

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:03.264
Not that weirdo.

01:32:04.686 --> 01:32:09.521
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:12.524
Kids who have your eyes...

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.104
And your lips...

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:16.027
And my...

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:18.897
Last name.
That's all I wish on them.

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:23.489
Please marry me, Linda.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:32.707
Before I make my decision,
you have to do something for me.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:39.589
You have to kiss me
in front of all these people!

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.471
You can do it, David!

01:32:49.439 --> 01:32:51.646
Give her a five-second frencher!

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:57.814
Kiss her, David.

01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:00.484
Kiss her, David.

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:04.158
Kiss her, David!

01:33:05.038 --> 01:33:07.199
Kiss her, David.

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.834
(So Yankees!

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.399
Dave's a dirty boy.

01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:40.186
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:45.032
I can't believe you actually
started to fall for that crazy man.

01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:47.569
Buddy's not such a bad guy.

01:33:53.002 --> 01:33:56.210
Congratulations! You just graduated
from anger management!

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:21.440
I'm glad your car died.
The train's romantic.

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:23.150
Don't change the subject.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:28.193
You're telling me the past two weeks
of my life was just therapy?

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:29.619
Well

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:30.949
yeah.

01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:33.490
I met with buddy
after reading his book...

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:36.956
And I told him about some
of the things going on in your life...

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:42.215
And how upset it was making you
and how nuts it was making me.

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:47.095
He said that he thought he could help,
but it would be tough.

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:49.301
So how much of this thing
was a setup?

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:53.844
Well, the guy in your seat on the
plane, the flight attendant, the judge...

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:56.104
They're all friends of buddy's.

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:59.607
What about the air marshal
who tasered me? Was he in on it?

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:01.608
No, he was just having a bad day.

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:04.395
Son of a bitch.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:18.334
Skipper, how you doing?

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.423
Buddy Rydell, you're a great man.

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.754
Except when galaxia
had ahold of you.

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:33.975
Did you just call that guy
buddy Rydell?

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:38.229
A guy named buddy Rydell
left this card

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:39.980
on what's left of my Lexus!

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:42.733
Oh, yeah. For insurance purposes.

01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:44.895
Your insurance was cancelled!

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:49.073
(Srenadal

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:53.278
don't point that gun at buddy.
I'm the one who smashed your car up.

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:54.571
- Dave?!
- No!

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.372
I'm sick of guys like this.

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:58.874
You wanna mess with my friends,
shoot me first.

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:00.205
- Don't!
- Are you crazy?

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.790
Settle down.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:04.547
Butt out! Tough guy's
going to learn a lesson.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:09.294
I'm not afraid. Dr. Rydell taught me
not to be afraid of anybody.

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:13.927
Can I ask you a question, though?

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.267
Got you!

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:31.275
Dr. b, Davey just pulled a joke on us!

01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:33.826
And how does that
make you feel, Lou?

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:47.832
Chuck.

01:36:48.011 --> 01:36:50.468
We were just doing a joke.
That's my friend.

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.045
Are you okay?

01:36:55.935 --> 01:36:58.392
He feels stunning.
