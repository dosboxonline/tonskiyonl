-and in violation of the chain of command.
-DEDRA: That's not accurate.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.125
You advised me
to reinforce my suspicions with data

38:07.208 --> 38:09.041
and to be careful
in my work going forward.

38:09.125 --> 38:10.125
Careful?

38:11.041 --> 38:13.125
Is that your defense?
You've been "careful"?

38:14.166 --> 38:16.416
I'd be curious
how many people at this table

38:16.500 --> 38:19.875
will think it "careful" that you've found
a way to access our sector data

38:19.958 --> 38:21.208
without ever filing a request.

38:21.291 --> 38:22.750
PARTAGAZ: Is that true, Dedra?

38:24.875 --> 38:27.125
(INHALES) Yes.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.833
I used the Imperial Emergency Act
in the wake of Aldhani

38:29.916 --> 38:32.666
to gather data across multiple sectors
without official sanction.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.458
But that is the wrong question.

38:34.541 --> 38:37.958
I'd like to know if anyone here believes
the Rebellion plans its actions

38:38.041 --> 38:40.708
around the artificially constructed
boundaries of our sectors.

38:40.791 --> 38:43.125
Major Partagaz created those sectors.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.708
As organizing principles,
not personal playthings.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.583
Do you think the rebels care
about the lines we draw on maps?

38:48.666 --> 38:51.375
You think the relevance of my work
has been supplanted?

38:52.333 --> 38:54.375
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Systems either change or die.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.208
Sir.

39:02.458 --> 39:03.958
Thesis, please.

39:04.041 --> 39:06.333
DEDRA: There is a focused,
organized rebel effort

39:06.416 --> 39:09.375
to acquire highly-restricted
Imperial military components.

39:09.458 --> 39:10.458
Your evidence?

39:10.541 --> 39:12.791
By accessing unfiltered
Sector Crime Reports

39:12.875 --> 39:15.750
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

39:15.833 --> 39:18.750
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

39:18.833 --> 39:22.000
This is hard, verifiable data
you are prepared to present?

39:22.083 --> 39:23.583
Yes, sir.

39:24.250 --> 39:28.125
I believe Supervisor Blevin is aware
I have a documented file ready to go.

39:28.208 --> 39:30.041
I believe his accusations
here this morning

39:30.125 --> 39:33.083
have more to do with self-preservation
than any sense of urgency.

39:33.166 --> 39:36.708
What's more urgent
than a renegade intelligence officer?

39:38.125 --> 39:42.625
Imagine if everyone in this room played
as loose with the rules as you.

39:42.708 --> 39:44.750
Excellent suggestion, Blevin.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.583
I'm wondering where we'd be right now
if everyone here

39:48.666 --> 39:51.166
showed the same endeavor
as Supervisor Meero.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.250
I'll have to think about that.

39:55.208 --> 39:59.291
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana sector to Supervisor Meero.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.500
Ferrix is of great interest to her

40:01.583 --> 40:04.041
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

40:04.125 --> 40:07.208
(INHALES) I see no urgent problem,
but, as always,

40:07.291 --> 40:10.375
I salute the provocative
exchange of ideas.

40:10.458 --> 40:12.875
Supervisor Grandi,
you will accelerate your schedule.

40:13.666 --> 40:16.791
Jung, I will expect your report
on Ord Mantell tomorrow.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.083
Thank you all for the lively session.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.916
Dedra, if you'd walk with me a moment.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.166
PARTAGAZ: Well-played.

40:36.833 --> 40:37.833
Thank you, sir.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.708
