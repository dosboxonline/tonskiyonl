WEBVTT

01:15.409 --> 01:17.953
Tonight's program
takes us backstage

01:17.953 --> 01:21.540
to witness firsthand
the creation, start to finish,

01:21.540 --> 01:25.252
of a new play mounted
on the American stage.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.755
Asteroid City does not exist.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.382
It is an imaginary drama

01:30.382 --> 01:33.260
created expressly
for this broadcast.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.264
The characters are fictional,
the text hypothetical,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.891
the events
an apocryphal fabrication,

01:39.891 --> 01:42.894
but together they present
an authentic account

01:42.894 --> 01:46.648
of the inner workings of
a modern theatrical production.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.527
Our story begins, of course,
with an ink ribbon.

01:50.527 --> 01:54.740
Conrad Earp, playwright,
native of upper Wyoming,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.909
well-known for
his romantic poetic tapestries

01:57.909 --> 02:00.704
of life west
of the Rocky Mountains.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.045
There is little amusement
to be had, however,

02:08.045 --> 02:09.963
in watching a man type.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.300
Skip ahead, then,
past the lonely, agonized months

02:13.300 --> 02:16.636
of composing, revising,
polishing, editing, rewriting,

02:16.636 --> 02:20.182
cutting, pasting, pacing,
doodling and solitary drinking,

02:20.182 --> 02:22.726
and join our company
as they take the stage

02:22.726 --> 02:24.936
for their first
read-through rehearsal.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.064
the Tarkington Theater,

02:27.064 --> 02:30.150
345 South Northwest Avenue.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.322
Curtain rises
on a desert bus stop

02:35.322 --> 02:38.575
halfway between
Parched Gulch and Arid Plains.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.702
Main scenography includes

02:40.702 --> 02:42.829
a 12-stool luncheonette,

02:42.829 --> 02:44.748
a one-pump filling station

02:44.748 --> 02:47.584
and a ten-cabin
motor court hotel.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.211
Upstage left:

02:49.211 --> 02:50.879
the Tomahawk Mountains.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.340
Highest peak: 11,000 feet.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.301
Upstage right:
an unfinished highway overpass

02:56.301 --> 02:58.595
which vaults up 20 feet,
then chops off midair

02:58.595 --> 03:00.931
behind a permanent roadblock.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.599
Center front: an impact crater

03:02.599 --> 03:04.518
a hundred feet
in depth and diameter

03:04.518 --> 03:08.271
encircled by a low Little League
variety chain-link fence.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.026
Offstage, distant:
a 650-car freight train

03:13.026 --> 03:16.571
which click-clacks by
at five miles an hour.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.365
Note to chief electrician:

03:18.365 --> 03:21.451
The light of the desert sun
is neither warm nor cool

03:21.451 --> 03:24.037
but always clean

03:24.037 --> 03:26.998
and, above all, unforgiving.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.418
Augie Steenbeck,

03:29.418 --> 03:31.753
war photographer, early 40s.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.090
His son Woodrow, 14,
also known as Brainiac.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.927
Midge Campbell, late 30s,
film actress.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.179
Her daughter Dinah, 15.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.807
June Douglas, schoolteacher.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.685
Ranch hand Montana, above.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.812
Grif Gibson, five-star general.

03:48.812 --> 03:53.358
Sandy Borden, Roger Cho,
J.J. Kellogg.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.861
Clifford, Ricky, Shelly.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.031
Stanley Zak, 65, retired.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.661
The action of the play takes
place in September of 1955.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.956
Act one:
Friday morning, 7:00 a.m.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.459
Act two: the next day.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.919
Act three: one week later.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.479
Our average speed is
83 feet per second.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.564
Poor fuel efficiency
due to excess wind resistance.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.149
Probably the luggage rack.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.034

08:14.911 --> 08:17.372

08:18.957 --> 08:21.501
How about a glass
of strawberry milk?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.588
What was that?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.465
Another atom bomb test.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.109
I've seen this combination
of symptoms twice before

08:46.109 --> 08:48.445
in the '52 Estate model.

08:48.445 --> 08:52.532
In one case, it was a quick fix
of a 75-cent part.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.701
In the other case,
it was a difficult, costly,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.662
time-consuming disassembly
and re-mantling

08:57.662 --> 08:59.164
of the entire drivetrain

08:59.164 --> 09:01.374
and lubrication mechanism,
which didn't work.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.001
The motor exploded itself,

09:03.001 --> 09:05.253
and the body was stripped
and sold for scrap.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.880
There it is.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.597
Well, which one have we got?

09:15.597 --> 09:17.807
We're about to find out.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.341
You got the first one.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.884
-How much do I owe you?
-Nothing.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.552
-Ten dollars for the tow.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.518
What's that? Wh-What's that?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.020
I don't know.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.617
I think you've got
a third problem

10:17.617 --> 10:19.702
we've never seen before.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.836
MAN
Zak residence.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.504
Romulus, this is
Augie Steenbeck.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.422
Good morning, Mr. Augie.
The gate is open.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.299
-No, we're not there.
-You're not here?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.135
-May I speak to Mr. Zak?
-Yes, Mr. Augie.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.736
-You're not here?
-We're not there.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.780
The car exploded.
Come get the girls.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.282
The car exploded?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.826
Parts of the car
exploded itself, yes.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.661
-Come get the girls.
-I'm not their chauffeur.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.037
I'm their grandfather.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.248
-Where are you?
-Asteroid City.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.292
Farm Route Six, mile 75.
Come get the girls.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.835
I have to stay here
with Woodrow.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.169
What are you talking about?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.463
The thing for Woodrow.
We're there.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.925
Hmm.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.639
-Hello?
-How'd they take it?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.644
They didn't.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.854
-No?
-No.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.439
-No.
-Yes.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.316
-You didn't tell them still?
-I still didn't tell them.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.651
-You promised.
-I know.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.864
The time is never right.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.199
The time...

11:40.199 --> 11:42.368
is always wrong.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.254
Are you okay?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.089
No.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.803
You never liked me, did you?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.848
I never loved you.
I always thought that you...

12:03.848 --> 12:05.767
You always thought
I wasn't good enough for her.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.061
Yes.
We're saying the same thing.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.356
-Gas up the Cadillac.
-Okay.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.690
-Tell the kids.
-I will.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.943
I'll be there when I get there.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.624
It's the end of that car.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.584
Andromeda, check under
the floor mats. Come on.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.252
Pandora, check the side pockets.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.254
Cassiopeia, check the cracks
between the seats.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.340
Take everything.
What do you think, Woodrow?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.258
I think it's kind of sad.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.735
Rest stop, 13 minutes.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.033
-Head count.
One.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.451
-Two.
-Three. -Four.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.785
-Five. -Six.
-Seven. -Eight.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.287
-Nine. -Ten.
-All present.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.039
Let's give thanks
for a safe journey. Billy?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.623
Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank thee kindly

13:52.623 --> 13:53.958
for a terrific bus ride.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.334
I ate three boxes
of Cracker Jacks,

13:55.334 --> 13:56.836
got a dog whistle
and a miniature map

13:56.836 --> 13:58.379
of the original 13 colonies.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.381
Also, we saw a coyote
get run over by a 14-wheeler

14:00.381 --> 14:02.091
and left him flat as a pancake.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.092
Boy, oh, boy. What else?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.302
The bus driver had to stop twice

14:04.302 --> 14:05.511
because Bernice
couldn't hold it.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.721
-Could so.
Amen.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.056
Amen.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.724
Lunchtime. Line up single file.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.021
My word. It's hot.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.647
It's the desert.
What'd you expect?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.733
I don't know if I expected
one thing or another,

14:18.733 --> 14:20.610
but I'm wilting
like a cut petunia.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.403
-Humans don't wilt.
-Don't they?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.738
No, wilting is a phenomenon

14:23.738 --> 14:25.698
by which a petal,
leaf or stem...

14:25.698 --> 14:27.325
Do you dare me?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.827
-Dare you what?
-To eat this hot pepper.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.413
-It's an experiment.
-No, don't do it.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.918
Hot pepper.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.795
Holy Toledo.
That's Midge Campbell.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.755
-Where? Who?
-Right smack in back of you.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.381
Don't look.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.425
That must be her bodyguard.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.636
Mr. Cho, yes? Hello.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.930
You're in cabin seven.
Well, tent seven.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.973
Here's the key,
but there's no door.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.725
Just a flap. Tent flap.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.310
-Tent?
-I know.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.562
I upgraded the electrical system
Tuesday morning.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.314
Better lighting,
power for the ice machine

14:58.314 --> 14:59.816
and a wall-mounted bug zapper.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.651
Unfortunately,
a mistake got made,

15:01.651 --> 15:03.194
and cabin seven
burned to the ground.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.445
It's a tent now.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.863
We don't want to sleep
in a tent.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.281
Of course. I understand.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.492
May I say, I think
you'll find it very comfortable.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.744
Is the young gentleman
in distress?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.954
He's thirsty.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.497
Of course. I understand.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.083
Uh, juice preference, please:
apple, orange or tomato?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.419
Excuse me, sir?

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922
This bucket of nuts
just stole my quarter.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.091
I beg your pardon.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.608
we didn't pack
your mother's suitcase.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.446
It's because she's not
coming with us on this journey.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.866
She can't come.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.243
She got too sick.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.620
And, to put it bluntly,
after all the surgeries,

15:54.620 --> 15:56.747
-therapies and interventions,

15:56.747 --> 15:59.667
after two years
of struggling and suffering,

15:59.667 --> 16:02.128
she succumbed to her illnesses.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.255
I'm sorry.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.090
I didn't know
how to tell you then.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.134
I couldn't figure out
how to tell you later.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.927
I didn't know what to do.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.471
The time was never right.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.934
You're saying our mother died
three weeks ago?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.271
Yes.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.274
When is she coming back?

16:23.274 --> 16:25.359
She's not coming back.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.820
Let's say she's in heaven.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.947
Which doesn't exist for me,
of course,

16:29.947 --> 16:31.949
but you're Episcopalian.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.077
Come here. Let me hug you.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.419
Okay. Sit back down.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.137
Did you know already, Woodrow?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.225
I think so.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.852
She'd been away so long.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.103
Mm-hmm.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.607
Yeah.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.275
We're gonna be okay.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.777
Your grandfather's on his way.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.862
We're gonna stay with him
for a period of time

17:09.862 --> 17:12.740
which is yet to be determined
how long it's gonna be.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.077
Is she in there?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.582
Yeah.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.876
She's in the Tupperware.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.588
Cremated.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.637
Are we orphans now?

17:36.264 --> 17:37.390
Huh?

17:37.390 --> 17:40.977
Are we orphans now?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.311
No.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.939
Because I'm still alive.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.736
When my father died, my mother
told me, "He's in the stars."

17:50.736 --> 17:54.156
I told her, "The closest star,
other than that one,

17:54.156 --> 17:55.908
"is four and half
light-years away

17:55.908 --> 17:58.577
with a surface temperature
over 5,000 degrees centigrade."

17:59.912 --> 18:01.580
"He's not in the stars," I said.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.499
"He's in the ground."

18:03.499 --> 18:05.251
She thought it would comfort me.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.836
She was an atheist.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.797
The other thing she'd say
which is incorrect:

18:09.797 --> 18:11.757
"Time heals all wounds."

18:11.757 --> 18:13.259
No.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.553
Maybe it can be a Band-Aid.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.014
Your concept of time is
completely distorted, though.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.849
I don't think any of you
except Woodrow

18:19.849 --> 18:22.393
even understands
what 15 minutes means.

18:22.393 --> 18:26.272
15 minutes is 6,200 hours.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.360
Exactly.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.404
That's not your fault.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.204
If you could have anything
in the world to eat right now,

18:42.204 --> 18:44.081
what would it be?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.420
The character of Augie Steenbeck

18:49.420 --> 18:51.589
in the imaginary tale
of our production

18:51.589 --> 18:54.342
was to become famously
and indelibly connected

18:54.342 --> 18:56.552
to the actor
who created the role,

18:56.552 --> 18:59.055
a former carpenter
discovered in a bit part

18:59.055 --> 19:01.390
by the play's director,
Schubert Green.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.559
I've finished
my correspondence, Analisse.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.353
Please bring me my cocktail
and my pill.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.896
-Remember, the gentleman...
-Oh, no.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.272
...referred by Mr. Green
has arrived.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.857
No. Send him away.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.734
Put him up at the Salty Skipper
or the Lighthouse Inn

19:11.734 --> 19:13.527
and tell him to come back
in the morning

19:13.527 --> 19:14.737
but not before 11:00.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.155
The occasion
of the first meeting

19:16.155 --> 19:18.491
between playwright and player
is now,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.076
in our fanciful telling,

19:20.076 --> 19:22.661
a matter of
theatrical lore and legend.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.664
late autumn,
late afternoon,

19:25.664 --> 19:28.751
a seaside village
outside the grand metropolis.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.337
Oh, no, again.
I-I beg your pardon. I'm sorry.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.048
Did Miss Watson not inform you?
I'm indisposed.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.300
I know, but the ice cream
would've melted.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.767
-What's this?
-I think it's the one you like.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.769
Gooseberry Wriggle
from the Frosty Spoon

19:46.769 --> 19:48.229
on East Rotterdam.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.272
I wrapped it in sawdust,
newspaper and peanut shells.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.690
You shouldn't waste
your spending money

19:51.690 --> 19:53.109
on an old fool like me.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.527
Well, they gave me
ten dollars bus fare,

19:54.527 --> 19:56.320
so I bought us a half bucket,
hitchhiked

19:56.320 --> 19:58.406
and pocketed the change.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.746
Cool and delicious.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.374
How long have you been
in the service?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.708
The service? What service?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.210
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.837
Well, unless I've been
deliberately misinformed,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.713
I believe those stripes
indicate the status

20:14.713 --> 20:16.507
of a ranking corporal,
second class.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.260
Oh, no. I-I'm G.I. Number Three
in Bugle Boy Blows the Blues.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.886
Was, anyway. We closed tonight.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.431
I see. Property of
the wardrobe department.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.266
Not anymore.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.978
How was it, by the way?

20:29.812 --> 20:31.272
-The play? It stunk.
-Mm.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.441
-Mind if I crack open a window?
-Uh, not at all.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.817
It's sweltering, isn't it?

20:34.817 --> 20:37.069
Even the daisies
and buttercups are drooping...

20:37.069 --> 20:40.030
That window sticks a bit.
That window sticks a bit!

20:43.784 --> 20:46.745
-You broke my window.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.420
Why does Augie burn his hand
on the Quicky-Griddle?

20:56.297 --> 20:58.591
Well, I don't even know myself,
to tell you the truth.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.009
I hadn't planned it that way.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.011
He just sort of did it
while I was typing.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.888
Is it too extraordinary for you?

21:03.888 --> 21:06.515
Uh, I guess, the way I read it,
he was looking for an excuse

21:06.515 --> 21:08.517
why his heart
was beating so fast.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.977
Oh.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.521
Oh, what an interesting
sentiment.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.356
I love that idea.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.816
Maybe he should say it.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.485
It's a very good line.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.032
No, I suppose not.
Not necessary.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.252
" playing)

21:47.223 --> 21:49.016
It's a fact-- we're not alone.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.726
The alien stole the asteroid.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.269
Long thought to be
a lunar splinter

21:52.269 --> 21:53.604
fragmented from the lesser moon

21:53.604 --> 21:56.023
of the hypothetical planet
Magnavox-27,

21:56.023 --> 21:58.234
now considered
a rogue pygmy cometette,

21:58.234 --> 22:00.736
according to the encyclopedia.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.363
Obviously, she would've said
something to him.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.281
I'm certain of it.
Your mother, I mean.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.825
She would've gotten him to tell
us the secrets of the universe

22:06.825 --> 22:09.078
or yelled at him
or made him laugh.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.622
She would've had a hypothesis.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.791
You remind me of her
more than ever.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.668
She wasn't shy.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.670
You'll grow out of that.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.340
I think your sisters might be
aliens, too, by the way.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.096
When I met your mother,
she was only 19.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.348
She was smoking a cigarette,
reading a paperback,

22:29.348 --> 22:32.059
taking a bath in a swimsuit
on a rusty fire escape

22:32.059 --> 22:34.895
a flight and a half
below my camera position.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.815
Sometimes
I sometimes still think

22:37.815 --> 22:40.734
I still hear her here

22:40.734 --> 22:43.028
breathing in the dark.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.326
Who knows, Woodrow?

22:49.326 --> 22:51.745
Maybe she is in the stars.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.844
You're perfect.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.975
" playing)

23:33.162 --> 23:35.539
-Okay?
-Okay.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.199
Hold on, partner!

24:13.285 --> 24:15.829
-Zut alors.
-Oh, no.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.834
When's the next one?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.587
Sunday morning, I think.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.433
Drink your juice.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.568
You took a picture of me.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.654
Uh-huh.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.906
Why?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.367
I'm a photographer.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.494
You didn't ask permission.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.163
-I never ask permission.
-Why not?

24:58.163 --> 25:02.501
Because I work in trenches,
battlefields and combat zones.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.919
Really?

25:03.919 --> 25:05.295
Uh-huh.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.840
You mean you're
a war photographer?

25:07.840 --> 25:08.757
Mostly.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.301
Sometimes I cover
sporting events.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.470
My name is Augie Steenbeck.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.514
Mm-hmm.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.852
What are you gonna do with it?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.437
That picture.

25:21.437 --> 25:24.690
Hmm. Well, if it's any good,
I guess I'll try to sell it

25:24.690 --> 25:27.025
to a magazine,
now that you mention it.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.862
"Midge Campbell
eating a waffle."

25:32.740 --> 25:35.534
Make me a print first,
to approve.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.328
Uh-huh.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.039
This is Dinah.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.207
This is Woodrow.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.542
I have a question.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.877
Uh-huh.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.879
Have you ever been shot
with bullets?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.714
Have I ever been...

25:48.714 --> 25:51.091
Uh, once or twice-- just grazed.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.303
He got shrapneled in the back
of the head, too. Show her.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.308
Hmm.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.688
I don't say I forgive you yet,
by the way.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.912
Welcome from the
United States Military-Science

26:19.912 --> 26:21.914
Research and Experimentation
Division,

26:21.914 --> 26:24.166
in conjunction with
the Larkings Foundation.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.751
We salute you.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.763
Each year,
we celebrate Asteroid Day,

26:37.763 --> 26:40.641
commemorating
September 23, 3007 BC,

26:40.641 --> 26:44.019
when the Arid Plains Meteorite
made Earth impact.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.855
The itinerary for
this three-day celebration

26:46.855 --> 26:49.233
includes a tour of the
newly refurbished observatory

26:49.233 --> 26:51.860
with Dr. Hickenlooper
and her staff,

26:51.860 --> 26:54.321
a picnic supper
of chili and frankfurters

26:54.321 --> 26:57.115
with evening fireworks display,

26:57.115 --> 26:59.201
the viewing of
the astronomical ellipses

26:59.201 --> 27:01.620
at its peak
just before midnight tonight,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.956
and finally,
the awarding of the annual

27:03.956 --> 27:08.085
Hickenlooper Scholarship
after Monday's banquet lunch.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.504
Now, I'll start by presenting
the commemorative medals,

27:10.504 --> 27:12.506
but first,
I'll do my speech first,

27:12.506 --> 27:15.551
which you'll also receive in
a folio edition as a souvenir.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.436
Chapter One.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.522
I walked to school 18 miles
each morning, milked the goats,

27:28.522 --> 27:30.148
plucked the chickens,
played hooky, caught fireflies,

27:30.148 --> 27:31.567
went skinny-dipping
in the watering hole,

27:31.567 --> 27:33.068
said my prayers every night

27:33.068 --> 27:34.820
and got whipped with
a maple switch twice a week.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.738
That was life.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.950
Chapter Two.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.994
My father went off to fight
in the war to end all wars--

27:41.994 --> 27:43.495
it didn't--
and what was left of him

27:43.495 --> 27:45.581
came back in a pine box
with a flag on top.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.499
End of Chapter Two.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.501
Next, I went to officer school,

27:49.501 --> 27:51.962
and 20 years passed
at the speed of a dream.

27:51.962 --> 27:55.173
A wife, a son,
a daughter, a poodle.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.259
Chapter Three. Another war.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.386
Arms and legs blown off
like popcorn,

27:59.386 --> 28:02.180
eyeballs gouged out,
figuratively and literally.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.266
The men put on shows
under the palm fronds

28:04.266 --> 28:05.851
dressed as women in hula skirts.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.561
That was life.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.938
In the meantime,
somebody else's story.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.481
A man thinks up a number,

28:11.481 --> 28:13.442
divides it by a trillion,
plugs it into the square root

28:13.442 --> 28:14.943
of the circumference
of the Earth

28:14.943 --> 28:16.778
multiplied by the speed
of a splitting atom,

28:16.778 --> 28:18.488
and voilà, progress.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.490
I'm not a scientist. You are.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.367
End of Chapter Three.

28:22.367 --> 28:25.037
Junior Stargazers
and Space Cadets,

28:25.037 --> 28:27.372
we watch transfixed as you enter

28:27.372 --> 28:30.667
into uncharted territories
of the brains and spirit.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.879
If you wanted to live
a nice, quiet, peaceful life,

28:33.879 --> 28:36.423
you picked the wrong time
to get born.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.509
That's my speech.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.354
Be notified, you are each
the guardian of your own safety.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.772
Maintain alert caution

28:51.772 --> 28:54.191
throughout the following
demonstrations.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.902
To Ricky Cho,
for his work in the field

28:56.902 --> 28:58.487
of aeronautical induction:

28:58.487 --> 29:01.073
the Collapsing Star
Ribbon of Success.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.492
To Clifford Kellogg,
for his work in the study

29:03.492 --> 29:06.453
of particle disintegration:

29:06.453 --> 29:08.413
the Black Hole Badge of Triumph.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.957
To Dinah Campbell...

29:09.957 --> 29:11.625
It's fueled by cosmic radiation
instead of sunlight.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.335
...for her work in the area

29:13.335 --> 29:15.379
of botanical acceleration...

29:15.379 --> 29:18.298
Unfortunately, it makes
all vegetables toxic.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.801
...the Red Giant Sash of Honor.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.302
To Shelly Borden, for her work

29:22.302 --> 29:23.887
in the realm
of mineral fabrication...

29:23.887 --> 29:25.889
I synthesized
an extraterrestrial element.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.558
It's going to be added
to the periodic table next year.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.186
...the Distant Nebula
Laurel Crown.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.689
To Woodrow Steenbeck...

29:34.982 --> 29:38.110
...for his work in the sphere
of astronomical imaging...

29:42.781 --> 29:44.950
It may have applications
in the development

29:44.950 --> 29:46.785
of interstellar advertising.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.454
...the White Dwarf
Medal of Achievement.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.961
Our tour ends here.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.671
Thank you for your attention,
and thank you

29:57.671 --> 30:00.382
to the Larkings Foundation
for their generous funding.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.182
-What do those pulses indicate?
-What?

30:09.182 --> 30:11.059
Oh, the beeps and blips?
We don't know.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.729
Indecipherable radio emissions
from outer space.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.981
-Probably a red herring.
-Does it change ever?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.733
Not to my knowledge.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.152
-It's a date, maybe.
-It's a date?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.862
-On the galactic calendar.
-Maybe.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.156
Mary, we think it's a date
on the galactic calendar.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.324
What? Wow.
-Is it always today?

30:28.201 --> 30:30.203
♪ Yippee-yay ♪

30:30.203 --> 30:34.124
♪ There'll be no wedding bells
for today ♪

30:34.124 --> 30:37.919
♪ I got spurs that jingle,
jangle, jingle... ♪

30:37.919 --> 30:39.337
We thank thee for the ketchup,

30:39.337 --> 30:40.672
and we thank thee
for the mustard.

30:40.672 --> 30:41.798
We thank thee for the relish,

30:41.798 --> 30:43.592
and we thank thee
for the onions.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.635
-We thank thee for the pickles,
and we thank... -Head count.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.762
-One.
-Two.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.013
-Three.
-Four.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.514
-Five.
-Six.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.224
-Dwight? Where's Dwight?
-Eight.

30:51.224 --> 30:53.810
-Dwight? Dwight? -J.J.:
Less than 0.0000% chance exists

30:53.810 --> 30:56.021
-of extraterrestrial life
in the entire universe. -Dwight!

30:56.021 --> 30:57.481
It's a scientific fact.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.274
Other than space bugs
and microscopic worms.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.942
-I assertively disagree.
-So do I.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.070
-It's not a scientific fact.
-It's not even a number.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.863
-Pass the pickles, please.
-How's the chili?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.656
-Fine, once you add
the hot sauce. -Thank you.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.116
Sparkler?
-Consider the constants:

31:08.116 --> 31:09.701
endless space
and immeasurable time.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.037
The likelihood is increased
by a factor of infinity.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.164
-Where'd you get that?
-The cantina machine.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.042
-Where's the cantina machine?
The cantina machine?

31:17.042 --> 31:20.378
Can you see anything
with those on your face?

31:20.378 --> 31:21.797
Hmm.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.965
Oh, gadzooks. Wh-What'd you...

31:23.965 --> 31:25.509
What did you do to deserve that?

31:25.509 --> 31:26.968
-Nothing.
-Who hit you?

31:26.968 --> 31:28.220
Nobody.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.597
It's greasepaint,
to feel like my character.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.225
Oh.
How does she get a black eye?

31:33.225 --> 31:34.351
In the story.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.811
Well, she doesn't in the story.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.646
-It's on the inside.
-Okay.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.731
-It's supposed to be, anyway.
-It's on the inside. All right.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.399
The Larkings
Foundation claims permanent,

31:41.399 --> 31:42.984
-incontestable rights.
-That's right.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.694
-They're ours. We own them.
-Incontestable rights

31:44.694 --> 31:46.238
to all patents
or inventions derived

31:46.238 --> 31:47.906
from any and every submission,
without exception.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.574
Not for teenagers.
Read the fine print.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.326
The projects all belong
to Uncle Sam.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.955
I call it
"Triple Orbit and Return

31:54.955 --> 31:57.499
without Burning Up
in the Atmosphere."

32:05.549 --> 32:08.176
Why are you sitting there
all by yourself?

32:08.176 --> 32:10.345
-You.
-Hmm?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.014
Uh, are you shy?

32:13.014 --> 32:15.016
I'm a late bloomer.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.810
So I've been told by my parents.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.729
-Are you intimidated by us?
-No.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.023
Let's do a personality test.
What's your name again?

32:22.023 --> 32:23.692
Woodrow L. Steenbeck.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.235
-Hmm.
-What's the "L" for?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.612
Lindbergh.
-Everybody look at Woodrow.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.828
I agree.
Shy but not intimidated.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.705
Move over here, Woodrow.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.136
-Brainiac, huh?
-Yeah, brainiac.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.929
It sort of goes without saying,
doesn't it?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.390
Everybody already knows
we're abnormally intelligent.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.726
That's true.
My mother made it for me.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.228
It's supposed to be funny,
according to her sense of humor,

33:00.228 --> 33:02.522
but it's not as hilarious
as it was originally.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.024
Oh, really? How come?

33:04.024 --> 33:07.485
Because she was alive then.
Now she's dead.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.654
-Oh.
-Ha-ha.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.242
What was she like?

33:14.242 --> 33:16.494
My... Oh, my mother?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.955
She was, um...

33:23.418 --> 33:25.378
...like this.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.722
When did you lose her?

33:36.973 --> 33:41.102
Officially, this morning,
but I think I already knew.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.021
Howdy.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.564
What are you doing up there?

33:44.564 --> 33:46.900
Just enjoying the desert air.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.860
-You dare me?
Dare you what?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.946
To jump off this bungalow.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.907
-It's an experiment.
-No.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.790
I love gravity.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.876
It might be my favorite
law of physics at the moment.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.964
Players of the stage,

34:08.964 --> 34:11.633
a tribe of troubadours
and nonconformists.

34:11.633 --> 34:14.970
They lead unconventional,
sometimes dangerous lives

34:14.970 --> 34:18.223
which nourish and elevate
their artistic aspirations

34:18.223 --> 34:20.517
and illuminate
the human condition.

34:20.517 --> 34:22.477
ten weeks later,

34:22.477 --> 34:25.438
the eve of Asteroid City's
first public preview.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.108
A drawing room on board
the Apache Plainsliner

34:28.108 --> 34:30.151
bound for the California coast.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.529
-It's open.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.866
Schubert says
you got to come back.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.619
If I'm so important,
why isn't he here himself?

34:39.619 --> 34:41.705
Probably too busy. Too busy
to go chasing after you.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.331
They sent me.
You know who I am?

34:43.331 --> 34:44.916
I think so. Understudy.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.044
The understudy. That's right.
Let me just, uh...

34:49.504 --> 34:51.589
He said, if you're crying,
I read you this one.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.966
No, that's not it. Here it is.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.926
If you're hopping mad,
I read you this one.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.011
Give me both.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.595
Not what he said.
He said, if...

34:57.595 --> 34:59.180
Give me both.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.938
"Tell her she's a stuck-up,
low-class snob

35:06.938 --> 35:08.606
"but she's got
no good reason to be.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.400
"If she sasses you,
sass her back.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.818
"Tell her she's
a borderline neurotic

35:11.818 --> 35:12.902
with an Achilles heel complex."

35:12.902 --> 35:14.946
That's the second one.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.534
"Tell her she relies on
her beauty like a wobbly crutch.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.827
"It's her deepest weakness.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.120
"Tell her
she's got the potential

35:22.120 --> 35:23.705
"for genuine greatness,
but I say

35:23.705 --> 35:26.708
with absolute certainty
she will never achieve it."

35:26.708 --> 35:28.376
Anything else?

35:30.211 --> 35:32.714
Uh-huh. He said,
if you're cool and collected,

35:32.714 --> 35:34.424
which I think is
what I think you seem to be,

35:34.424 --> 35:36.593
then that means you probably
really don't want to come back

35:36.593 --> 35:37.886
and I got to give you this.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.679
-Read it.
-Not what he said.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.890
He said this one's private.
Just the two of you.

35:41.890 --> 35:44.559
He said that... He-he said...

35:50.357 --> 35:52.067
"Dear Kim, I'm sorry I shouted

35:52.067 --> 35:54.152
"and called you a spoiled bitch
and a minor talent

35:54.152 --> 35:56.321
"and broke your glasses
and threw them out the window.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.906
"Given that I have always
considered you

35:57.906 --> 35:59.574
"to be the most consummately
gifted living actress

35:59.574 --> 36:01.576
"and a person of great
intelligence and character,

36:01.576 --> 36:03.161
"these statements and actions

36:03.161 --> 36:05.330
"do not accurately reflect
my true feelings.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.956
"Yes, I may be
a manipulative snake,

36:06.956 --> 36:08.750
"as you once characterized me
behind my back--

36:08.750 --> 36:11.628
"you see, I do have my sources--
but I love you like a sister,

36:11.628 --> 36:13.922
"other than that one time
in the bathroom the day we met,

36:13.922 --> 36:16.674
"which has never been repeated,
as we both know.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.264
"I never meant to hurt you

36:23.264 --> 36:25.517
"or insult you
or offend you in any way,

36:25.517 --> 36:28.269
"only to try with the few tools
I have at my disposal

36:28.269 --> 36:31.064
"to do my job,
which is to make it work.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.399
"Forgive me.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.275
"We open tomorrow night,
with or without you.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.694
"Without,
our entire devoted company

36:36.694 --> 36:39.239
"will suffer complete disaster
and tragic calamity,

36:39.239 --> 36:42.409
"as will a brilliant, fragile
genius named Conrad Earp.

36:42.409 --> 36:45.537
"With, you will enjoy
the triumph of your career,

36:45.537 --> 36:47.914
"which does not matter
in the least.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.626
"All that matters is
every second of life onstage

36:51.626 --> 36:53.211
"and our friendship.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.629
"Your servant, your director

36:54.629 --> 36:57.382
"and, if I may,
your devoted mentor,

36:57.382 --> 36:59.134
Schubert Green."

37:05.473 --> 37:07.934
What's your name, understudy?

37:09.436 --> 37:12.105
They continued through
the night as far as Ohio,

37:12.105 --> 37:14.649
then disembarked
and caught the return flight

37:14.649 --> 37:17.652
arriving two hours
prior to curtain.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.780
The talented understudy
immediately replaced

37:20.780 --> 37:23.158
the original Woodrow.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.410
I strongly question

37:25.410 --> 37:26.911
whether your daughter's
Silly Putty

37:26.911 --> 37:28.538
resembles anything
from outer space.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.582
-It's not Silly Putty.
-I'm sorry, but I doubt it.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.916
It's called S'morestozium.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.376
-This is excellent.
-Thank you.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.003
It's really all
the machine's doing.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.130
What the devil do you know
about astrogeology anyway,

37:37.130 --> 37:38.756
J.J., whatever that stands for?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.008
I just maintain the workings.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.676
Shelly's thesis
is supported by...

37:41.676 --> 37:43.052
Flimsy, outdated evidence.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.679
-I beg your pardon?
-Not in my opinion.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.431
I liked the Silly Putty
or S'morestozium, in fact.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.724
I'm just quoting what he said.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.017
Your son's project
might very well

37:49.017 --> 37:50.518
have killed us all today,
by the way.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.145
Coming from the family
that brought us

37:52.145 --> 37:53.605
-the electromagnetic death ray.
-It's a weapon.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.732
-Of course it's lethal.
-So you admit it.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.525
Not to mention Brainiac's flag.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.444
I mean, is he trying to provoke
World War Three or something?

37:59.444 --> 38:01.112
The jet propulsion belt
is eminently safe.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.906
I'd allow an eight-year-old boy
to operate it.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.824
In fact, I did--
Ricky's cousin Chip--

38:04.824 --> 38:08.036
and he broke the solo flight
altitude record.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.787
They're strange, aren't they?

38:09.787 --> 38:11.664
Your children,
compared to normal people.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.124
-Yes.
-That's correct.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.084
-It's true.
-Hmm.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.794
After that, the second person

38:16.794 --> 38:18.796
says the name the first one
said, then adds another.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.548
Then the third person says both
plus a new name.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.967
And then the next person keeps
going, and so on in a circle.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.177
It's a memory game. Get it?

38:24.177 --> 38:25.470
I'll start. Cleopatra.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.263
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.431
-Like that?
-Exactly.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.933
-Of course. Yes.
Got it.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.310
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.604
-Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.356
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

38:36.356 --> 38:39.609
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,
Paracelsus.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.236
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

38:41.236 --> 38:44.864
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,
Paracelsus, uh, Kurt Gödel.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.032
Oh, the Vienna Circle.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.284
-The Austrian logician.
-Correct.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.870
Cleopatra,

38:50.870 --> 38:52.872
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

38:52.872 --> 38:54.874
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

38:54.874 --> 38:56.876
Paracelsus,

38:56.876 --> 38:58.545
Kurt Gödel,

38:58.545 --> 39:00.255
-William Bragg.
Which one?

39:00.255 --> 39:02.006
There's two.
-William Henry Bragg.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.050
I prefer the son.
The father's better.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.553
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

39:06.553 --> 39:08.429
-Antonie van...
Leeuwenhoek.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.099
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,

39:11.099 --> 39:12.433
William Henry Bragg.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.519
-And the new one.
-Lord Kelvin.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.563
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose,

39:16.563 --> 39:18.856
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,

39:18.856 --> 39:21.776
William Henry Bragg,
Lord Kelvin...

39:21.776 --> 39:23.653
Midge Campbell. Can I say her?

39:23.653 --> 39:25.863
As long as she's a real person,
you can say anybody you like.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.448
Cleopatra,
Jagadish Chandra Bose...

39:27.448 --> 39:29.117
-Including my mother.
She's my idol.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.369
My turn. Jagadish Chandra Bose,
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

39:31.369 --> 39:33.871
Paracelsus, Kurt Gödel,
William Bragg, the father,

39:33.871 --> 39:35.540
Lord Kelvin,
the mathematical physicist,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.625
Midge Campbell, your mother,

39:37.625 --> 39:40.044
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,
the rocket scientist.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.921
I don't know
if this game works with us.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.381
Uh, brainiacs, I mean.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.591
I-I think
it might go on forever.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.800
I don't mind.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.176
In my school, nobody'd play

39:47.176 --> 39:48.970
this game with me
in a million years.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.513
Plus, the names
would be too obvious.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.973
I know my next one: Diophantus.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.474
Wait until it's time to say it.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.560
Try it backwards, Brainiac.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.395
Say the new one first.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.733
Hojo Tokiyuki,

40:01.733 --> 40:03.818
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,

40:03.818 --> 40:05.987
Midge Campbell, Lord Kelvin,

40:05.987 --> 40:08.531
William Henry Bragg, Kurt Gödel,

40:08.531 --> 40:10.908
Paracelsus,
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,

40:10.908 --> 40:13.202
Jagadish Chandra Bose...

40:14.746 --> 40:16.748
Cleopatra.

40:30.178 --> 40:33.181
Put out that cigarette, Dwight.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.641
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.768
You men should be ashamed
of yourselves. Are you?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.478
Yes, ma'am,
but we didn't give him that.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.729
-Didn't you?
-That cigarette.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.230
He just must have got it
his own self

40:41.230 --> 40:43.024
-from the cigarette machine.
-Dwight!

40:46.944 --> 40:48.613
I almost believe you.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.406
Let's go.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.452
-So long, Dwight.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.931
Was I ever there?

41:15.723 --> 41:17.600
Was I ever there?

41:18.559 --> 41:21.437
Was I... ever there?

41:25.817 --> 41:27.610
Memorizing my lines.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.487
Uh-huh.

-You didn't say anything.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.980
Uh, I meant yes. My mouth...
my mouth didn't speak.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.356
It's a monologue.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.442

When you first picked me out

42:28.463 --> 42:30.798
I had $111 in my bank account.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.633
I lived alone
with a cat and a parakeet

42:32.633 --> 42:34.177
in a one-room dishwater flat.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.387
I sold the DeSoto
to lend you the down payment

42:36.387 --> 42:37.889
for my engagement ring.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.223
It was spring.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.850
I'm not sore.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.977
I know you're a good man.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.437
I'm not sorry.

42:44.437 --> 42:46.481
I never deceived you.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.983
Remember me as a blur
in the rearview mirror.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.818
Was I ever there?

42:50.818 --> 42:52.904
Did you actually see me?

42:54.489 --> 42:56.866
I can't even see myself anymore.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.537
But here I am.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.293
Let's get divorced.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.714
It'll be done tastefully,
of course.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.383
We cut to the back of my legs
when the towel falls down.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.763
Sometimes they sometimes
do a stunt double.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.640
Sometimes.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.850
I don't know if I like beards,
by the way.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.185
Oh.

43:24.185 --> 43:25.895
Can I take another picture?

43:25.895 --> 43:27.647
Not for publication.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.274
I thought
you never ask permission.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.280
Don't move.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.457
I prefer to play abused,
tragic alcoholics,

43:46.457 --> 43:48.584
and one day, I'll probably
be discovered lifeless

43:48.584 --> 43:50.461
in an overflowing bathtub
with an empty bottle

43:50.461 --> 43:53.256
of sleeping pills spilled
all over the floor, but...

43:53.256 --> 43:57.468
the sad thing is I'm actually
a very gifted comedienne.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.595
-That's true.
-Are you married?

43:59.595 --> 44:02.390
I'm a widower,
but don't tell my kids.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.016
-Why not?
-I-I...

44:04.016 --> 44:05.977
-I mean, I wasn't going to.
-All right. Okay.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.728
-Yeah.
-Oh. I'm sorry.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.941
Thank you. They do know,
by the way, but just barely.

44:20.324 --> 44:21.659
What do you swap for

44:21.659 --> 44:23.703
out of this particular jukebox,
mister?

44:23.703 --> 44:25.371
Of course. I understand.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.039
This machine sells land.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.666
-Land, you say?
-Yes, indeed.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.501
The properties just beyond
these cottages, in fact.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.044
Out of this here
soda pop machine?

44:32.044 --> 44:33.504
Yes, indeed.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.258
Well, now, I ain't calling you
a liar to your face,

44:37.258 --> 44:39.343
but that sounds to me like
some kind of toadswindle.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.304
Of course. I understand.
It's not a toadswindle.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.889
You put in the money,
you receive

44:42.889 --> 44:44.599
a notarized deed to the land.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.183
How big a spread?

44:46.183 --> 44:47.602
For ten dollars in quarters,

44:47.602 --> 44:50.229
approximately half
a tennis court.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.697
Put the potion in it.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.241
Friskity, triskity,
briskity, boo.

45:02.241 --> 45:05.244
Knickerty, knockerty,
tockerty, too.

45:06.370 --> 45:11.584
And with this spell,
Mama comes back alive!

45:11.584 --> 45:14.295
God save these bones.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.929
What's in the Tupperware?

45:22.929 --> 45:24.639
♪ Freight train, freight train ♪

45:24.639 --> 45:27.600
♪ Going so fast... ♪

45:27.600 --> 45:30.019
He finally told you.

45:30.978 --> 45:33.648

what train he's on ♪

45:33.648 --> 45:37.944
♪ Won't you tell me
where's he gone... ♪

45:41.405 --> 45:43.240
Who's this old man?

45:43.240 --> 45:44.951
Poppy, I think.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.577
You don't remember me.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.746
I remember his smell.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.964
We're not going to abandon
my daughter

45:57.964 --> 45:59.840
at a motel
in the middle of the desert

45:59.840 --> 46:02.969
buried next to
the communal showers.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.347
-You're ruining the funeral!
-He's making her go to hell!

46:06.347 --> 46:09.934
If you torture us,
we'll sacrifice you.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.519
I understand.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.981
Thank you for your clarity.

46:14.981 --> 46:17.233
I'll tell you what--
let's leave her

46:17.233 --> 46:19.193
alone in the ground
until tomorrow morning.

46:19.193 --> 46:20.820
Then we'll exhume
the Tupperware,

46:20.820 --> 46:22.738
bring her with us
in the Cadillac

46:22.738 --> 46:25.032
and bury her again this weekend
in the backyard

46:25.032 --> 46:26.742
next to the seventh hole
at Rancho Palms,

46:26.742 --> 46:28.995
where I live in a beautiful
house with a swimming pool.

46:28.995 --> 46:30.287
Agreed?

46:30.287 --> 46:32.248
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.543
Let's hope a coyote doesn't
dig her up in the meantime.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.420
Nothing we can do about it
anyway.

46:38.963 --> 46:41.215
Ooh. Look at that.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.274
Tonight, you're in
for a real treat.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.234
I don't know how many of you
ever observed

47:00.234 --> 47:02.028
an astronomical ellipses before.

47:02.028 --> 47:04.864
In fact, can we get
a show of hands?

47:05.865 --> 47:07.283
Nobody?

47:07.283 --> 47:09.160
Wow. Okay.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.997
Well, what you're gonna see
is a very simple dot-dot-dot:

47:12.997 --> 47:15.666
three pinpoints of light
inside your refracting box,

47:15.666 --> 47:18.002
which may not sound
very exciting at first,

47:18.002 --> 47:19.503
until you consider
how those dots

47:19.503 --> 47:20.880
managed to transmit themselves

47:20.880 --> 47:22.798
across a thousand billion miles
of space

47:22.798 --> 47:25.885
onto that little scrap
of black cardboard.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.595
Twice every 57 years,

47:27.595 --> 47:29.430
when the Earth,
the sun, the moon

47:29.430 --> 47:31.098
and the galactic plane
of the Milky Way

47:31.098 --> 47:34.018
all combobulate along the same
angle of orbital interest,

47:34.018 --> 47:37.563
the radiant energy of three
neighboring stellar systems

47:37.563 --> 47:39.356
induces a parallel
ecliptic transit,

47:39.356 --> 47:41.192
thus all but proving

47:41.192 --> 47:43.569
the hypothesis
of celestial flirtation.

47:43.569 --> 47:46.530
The hitch, of course,
is that the math doesn't work.

47:46.530 --> 47:48.240
But maybe one of you one day

47:48.240 --> 47:50.493
will be the genius
who solves that problem.

47:50.493 --> 47:53.537
The event will begin
in 30 seconds.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.706
Remember, if you look directly
at the ellipses

47:55.706 --> 47:57.333
rather than through
your refracting box,

47:57.333 --> 47:59.210
not only will you
not actually see the effect

47:59.210 --> 48:00.711
but you will burn the dots

48:00.711 --> 48:02.588
straight into your retina,
probably permanently.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.965
I know that for a fact, because
they're still burned into mine

48:04.965 --> 48:06.926
from when I was 11 going on 12.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.553
That's when I realized
I wanted to be an astronomer,

48:09.553 --> 48:10.846
which is another story.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.014
Here we go.

48:38.415 --> 48:39.959
There it is.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.254
Uh, these are just such

48:43.254 --> 48:45.214
marvelously luminous colors,
aren't they?

48:45.214 --> 48:47.424
Very exciting.
Does everybody see it?

48:47.424 --> 48:49.885
I don't. I just see a staple.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.850
Yipe! It works.

48:56.684 --> 48:58.310
Are you Shelly?

48:58.310 --> 48:59.520
Yeah.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.981
I'm your idol. What's your rank?

49:01.981 --> 49:04.024
Commanding secretary.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.734
I was a Cookie Trooper myself.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.194
Really? Wow.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.822
What'll they say in Squad 75?

49:13.367 --> 49:14.994
Hmm?

51:56.655 --> 52:00.701
The, uh, alien
stole the asteroid.

52:14.715 --> 52:18.510

52:18.510 --> 52:20.220
Director, immigrant.

52:20.220 --> 52:24.350
Known for his limitless energy,
his voracious enthusiasms--

52:24.350 --> 52:26.769
a well-known actress
described him sexually

52:26.769 --> 52:29.563
as an animal,
specifically a rabbit--

52:29.563 --> 52:33.233
and his long, deep
and intimate relationship

52:33.233 --> 52:35.486
with success.

52:35.486 --> 52:37.488
What do you think, Lunky?

52:37.488 --> 52:39.656
Good.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.538
I'm not going to ask
what the hell's going on here.

nervous to go to Earth.

58:49.943 --> 58:51.945

I bet you.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.447

58:53.447 --> 58:54.781

I reckon that alien
don't mean no harm at all.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.541
I reckon he just
took hisself down here

59:46.541 --> 59:49.503
to have a look-see at the land
and the peoples on it.

59:49.503 --> 59:51.838
In the spirit of exploration.

59:51.838 --> 59:55.217

alien all suspicious-like.

59:55.217 --> 59:57.135

59:57.135 --> 59:59.513
No, he ain't a creature
of God's green Earth.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:03.642
But he's a creature
of somewheres, and so are we.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:07.229
Now, let's show the old feller
some hospitality,

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.523

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.610
well, that'll be a job for
the United States armed forces,

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.354
Not to my knowledge.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.565
I think because of my history
with violent men.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:43.153
Starting with my father,
brother and uncles.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:47.157
There's always already the thing
I plan to do next, too.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.700
Usually, it's a war.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.910
Nobody can compete with that,
can they?

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.662
Probably not.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.330
I did a USO tour once.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.041
It was thrilling.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:04:00.295
♪ I owe my soul
to the company store... ♪

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:04.424
-I think I see how I see us.
-Hmm?

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:07.469
I mean, I think I know now
what I realize we are.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:08.678
Okay.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.263
Two catastrophically
wounded people

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.266
who don't express the depths
of their pain because...

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.642
we don't want to.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.102
That's our connection.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.146
Do you agree?

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:22.150
Uh-huh.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.694
Let's, um...

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.989
Let's change the subject,
shall we?

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.492
It's open.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.331
-Hello?
In here.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.127
Hello? Hello.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:42.712
I'm just your neighbor,
Stanley Zak.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.547
I wanted to make sure
you and your daughter

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.508
have everything you might need
at the moment.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.009
Thank you. I think so.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.261
What a strange experience
this is, isn't it?

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.806
I went to law school with
your former agent, by the way.

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.641
-Mort?
-Mort. Yes, Mort.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:55.850
Oh.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.895
That came out.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.856
Yeah, it came out.
All my pictures come out.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:07.487
Anyway, as I say,
we're just across the driveway,

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:10.240
as my son-in-law seems
to have established.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.617
Send my best wishes to Mort
and his family.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:14.035
I will, if and when
we're permitted

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.578
contact with the outside world,

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.581
though I don't speak to him,
to tell you the truth.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.459
I love your hairdo like that.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.294
Ugh, Christ.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.549
You see
that wonderful crackly-patch

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.175
right out there
between the dead cactuses

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:30.510
and the dried-up riverbed?

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.053
-I think so.
-That's your parcel.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.680
How much of it do I own?

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.223
Well, it's actually
an interesting

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.683
financial mechanism.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.018
You don't technically own
anything outright.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:41.813
You own stock in the town
in the form of a loan

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:43.148
with a 50-year maturity rate.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:44.357
Then, at the end,
the loan is forgiven.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.692
-You dare me?
-How about water?

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.152
Of course. I understand.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:49.112
There isn't any.
This is a desert opportunity.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.530
-You dare me?
-I heard you.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.157
-It's an experiment.
-I don't care anymore.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:54.367
I dare you or I don't dare you.
It doesn't matter.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.619
Do what you wish. I give up.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.463
What's the cause?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.965
What's the meaning?

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.634
Why do you always
have to dare something?

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.307
I don't know.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:22.395
Maybe it's because I'm afraid,

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:26.524
otherwise, nobody'll...

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:32.238
notice my existence

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.532
in the universe.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.668
Dare you what?

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.713
Yes, dare you what?

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.423
To climb that cactus out there.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.175
-Lord, no. No.
-Please don't.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.596
Hello.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.306
Hello. Hello.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.683
We met before. I'm the mother
of that Cookie Trooper

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.435
-who idolizes you.
-I know.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:05.438
Thought you might not
recognize me out of uniform.

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:07.065
You were very good in the one

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.858
about the tramp in the brothel
who gets amnesia

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.526
-and becomes a pediatrician.
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.153
-You were very authentic.
-That's actually maybe

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.529
my favorite character
I've ever played.

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.240
I don't know why
nobody else liked it.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.950
Oh. Yes. Me, neither.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.701
Thank you. Some people liked it.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.662
Oh, I'm sure. I did.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.580
Who hit you?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.087
Am I not in this?

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.258
Excuse me. I'm not in this.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.801
Um, who hit you?

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.970
-It's on the other eye.
-It's greasepaint.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.638
Some people did-- do-- liked it.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:40.306
Oh, I'm sure.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:43.184
I thought it might have been
your second ex-husband in Utah.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.532
If I sleep on a cot
instead of the sofa bed,

01:07:57.532 --> 01:07:59.117
that might leave room
for me to set up

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:00.785
-a darkroom in the pool house.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.161
Is that possible
as a compromise?

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.830
-It depends on the measurements.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.415
-It's not that big. -I can
actually carpool the girls

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.583
to school by golf cart,
you know.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.085
If I cut across the 14th tee.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.628
Oh, it's that close
to the elementary?

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:12.547
How can you two
even think about this?

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.841
The world will never
be the same.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.051
What happens next? Nobody knows.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.970
Will he visit us again?
Will he speak to us?

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.097
What will he say?
Why did he steal our asteroid?

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:23.474
Was it ours in the first place?
Does he like us?

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:25.184
-Nobody knows.
-That's true.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.687
What's out there? Something.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.981
The meaning of life.
Maybe there is one.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:33.026
I hope you're still
Episcopalian.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:35.486
You took his picture, Dad.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:41.326
I'm a photographer.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.707
Episcopalian?

01:08:55.882 --> 01:08:57.633
You really want us, Stanley?

01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:00.553
No, but you need me.

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.221
She did love me, you know.

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:03.890
Who says she didn't?

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.975
I've been on my own
for 12 years, after all.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.519
And remember,
my wife drank herself to death.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:12.065
"Drank herself to..."
I don't know what that means.

01:09:12.065 --> 01:09:15.568
In my loneliness--
or perhaps because of it--

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.820
I've learned
not to judge people,

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:21.366
to take people as I find them,
not as others find them,

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.326
and most of all,
to give complete

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.496
and unquestioning faith
to the people I love.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.915
I don't know
if that includes you,

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:32.543
but it included my daughter
and your four children,

01:09:32.543 --> 01:09:34.128
so you're welcome
to stay with me

01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:36.672
for as long as you wish,
whether I like it or not.

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.800
Which I don't, by the way.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.055
Stop helping us.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.640
We're in grief.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.435
♪ He rides in the sun
till his day's work is done ♪

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:50.895
Me, too.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:54.899
♪ And he rounds up
the cattle each fall ♪

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.991
♪ Singing his cattle call... ♪

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:06.244
Are you planning to abandon us?

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:10.540
Uh...

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.042
I was, as a temporary measure.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.627
-What?
-But I decided against it.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.295
-I knew it. I sensed it.
-I didn't.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.131
I'm not the wet nurse.
I'm their grandfather.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.174
I would've hired a babysitter
in addition to you.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.176
I'm not planning
to abandon you anymore,

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:23.553
even as a temporary measure,

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.847
which is all
it ever would've been.

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:30.309
I forgive you
for considering it.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.421
Evening, soldier.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:01.674
Can I ask you to stick this dime
in the pay phone for me, please?

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.134
All public telephone service

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:04.886
has been suspended
until further notice.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.262
I know it. The thing is,

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.889
right before the hubbub
yesterday,

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.932
I made a trunk call
to my cousin long-distance,

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.684
and the operator
let me owe the surcharge

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:13.478
because all I had
was three pennies.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:16.564
I don't feel right stealing
from the telephone company.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.764
Although it might convey
a different meaning

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.182
-on his planet.
-It's true.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.017
If he even has a planet,
by the way.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.310
-He might be nomadic.
-Hmm.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.229
Operator?
Kismet-nine-seven-seven-oh.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.022
-Station to station.
Stay on the line.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.398
-Thank you.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.029
-Hello? Who's calling?

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.156
Good evening, Mrs. Weatherford.
It's Ricky Cho.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.242
-May I have a word with...
-Ricky, it's after 9:00.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:10.701
He's already drinking
his Ovaltine.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:12.078
Can't this wait until tomorrow?

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.663
I'm afraid not,
Mrs. Weatherford.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.289
I-I wouldn't disturb you
if it weren't

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.500
of the utmost importance
to the Weekly Bobcat.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.919
I just need a minute
of his time.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.546
All right, Ricky. Hold the line.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:23.464
Some kind of romance
between the two of you?

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:24.924
-Skip, Ricky Cho!
-What? Who?

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:26.300
-Who? You.
-Who?

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.635
-You know who.
-Us?

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:28.928
We only met yesterday.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.429
I feel she doesn't like me
in that way.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.639
Uh-huh. Well, I think
you're pretty smart,

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.057
but I think you're pretty dumb.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.308
-Hello?
-Shh, shh. Hold it.

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.978
Skip? Ricky. We got a scoop.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:48.614
The first hints of the future
existence of Asteroid City

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.616
were revealed during
a special seminar

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.994
scheduled at
the playwright's request.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:55.371
Conrad Earp,
how can we help you?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.540
Well, the thing is, Saltzie,
I'd like to make a scene

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:00.793
where all my characters are
each gently, privately seduced

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:03.337
into the deepest, dreamiest
slumber of their lives

01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:05.256
as a result of
their shared experience

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:08.092
of a bewildering and bedazzling
celestial mystery.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.678
-A sleeping scene.
-A scene of sleep.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.263
But I don't know
how to write it.

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.390
-Yet.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.017
I thought, perhaps, if you

01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:19.228
and your wonderfully talented
pupils just improvise,

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.439
something might reveal itself.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.482
Who wasn't going to be famous?

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:27.486
On any given day, roll call
in Saltzburg Keitel's classroom

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:31.699
was a now dazzling list
of undiscovered luminaries:

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.409
Linus Mao.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.161
Lucretia Shaver.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.996
Walter Geronimo.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.497
Asquith Eden.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.124
Mercedes Ford.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:43.628
Even, unofficially, Jones Hall.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:46.088
What's it about, the play?

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.967
Mm, infinity,
and I don't know what else.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:51.636
Is there a title?

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:52.678
I'm torn.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.306
Maybe The Cosmic Wilderness.

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.599
Do you like that one?

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.184
-Mm, not really.
Uh-uh.

01:13:58.184 --> 01:13:59.769
What's the alternative?

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.020
Title, I mean.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.480
Well, it's the name
of the small town

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.065
on the California/Nevada/
Arizona desert

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:05.691
where the story takes place.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:10.071
Okay. Who here has ever
actually fallen asleep onstage

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:13.115
during a live performance
in front of a paying audience?

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.784
Me.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:17.286
I spent the first three-quarters
of Act Two of The Welterweight

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:21.332
on a massage table with no lines
till the last minute and a half.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.709
One night, I nodded off.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:26.045
-On purpose, you did this?
- No.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:28.756
-Did you miss your cue?
-Almost.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.217
I heard it,
and I woke up very scared,

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:32.718
but I knew my lines.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.470
-Good morning, Schubert.
-Good morning, Saltzie.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.971
What brings you here today?

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.515
We haven't seen you
in six weeks.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.558
Lavender and Lemons
opened last night

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:42.561
to very good, uh...
I might say raves, by the way.

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:44.271
I'm available.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.025
What did he teach? Example.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:49.985
Sleep-- it's not death.

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.196
The body keeps busy,
breathing air,

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.739
pumping blood, thinking.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.033
Maybe you pay a visit
to your dead mother.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.036
Maybe you go to bed
with your ex-wife or husband.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:00.705
Maybe you climb the Matterhorn.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.707
Connie, you wake up
with a new scene

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.834
three-quarters written
in your head already.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.545
Schubert, you wake up
with a hangover.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:09.171
Important things happen.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.257
Is there something to play?
I think so.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:14.051
Let's work on the scene
from the outside in.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:15.428
Be inert.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.430
Then dream.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.560
Where are we, Connie? And when?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.728
Talk to us.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.187
Yes. All right.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.605
One week later.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.524
Our cast of characters'
already tenuous

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.444
grasp of reality has further
slipped in quarantine,

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.571
and the group begins
to occupy a space

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.906
of the most peculiar
emotional dimensions.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.908
Meanwhile,
the information blockade

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.952
spearheaded
by General Grif Gibson

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.413
has been, it appears...

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:44.623
incomplete.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.909
Extra! Extra! Late edition!

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.577
Extra! Extra!

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.329
Late edition!

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.878
I hope you're aware, you and
your accomplices may still face

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:33.339
felony prosecution,
possibly even a treason charge.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:35.633
I'll fight it all the way
to the Supreme Court,

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.927
-if necessary, and win.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.346
This just in,
from the president.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.098
He's furious.
Thanks a lot, Ricky.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:45.142
I don't know what to say,
General Gibson.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.977
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize, Dad.

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.687
The public has a right
to the truth.

01:16:48.687 --> 01:16:51.065
-You made your point.
-This tribunal is a mockery!

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.733
What about Steenbeck,
who took the photograph?

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.693
It's on the front page of
every newspaper on the planet.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:57.238
-Can't we arrest him, as well?
-Unfortunately, no.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:58.781
He dropped a print in the mail

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.449
to his photo agency
first thing Tuesday morning,

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.785
and the postman got it
before we did. He's innocent.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:04.787
Supposedly, he did a nude
of Midge Campbell, too.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.164
-Midge Campbell?
-Ooh, Midge Campbell.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.125
As you know, boys and girls,
your parents arrived

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.710
late last night
by military helicopter.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.504
They've been sequestered
in that metal hut over there

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.089
for the past several hours
while the government scientists

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.549
explain the situation to them,

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.175
although everything's
already in the newspapers.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.802
It's my understanding
they're about to go onto

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.387
this closed-circuit
television set at any moment.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:23.556
Everything's connected,
but nothing's working.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:26.934
Let's carry on with
the lesson plan, then. Billy?

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.602
I did the alien's flying saucer

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:31.272
with a hubcap
and a chicken pot pie tin.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:33.524
Good work. Very accurate.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:35.067
Jupiter, fifth planet
from the sun,

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.569
largest in our solar system...

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.945
Yes, Bernice?

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.489
I did the alien
on his home planet.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.617
Well done. How wonderful.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:45.703
Due to extreme
atmospheric conditions,

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:49.123
an anticyclonic storm has raged
on Jupiter's surface for over...

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:50.249
Yes, Dwight?

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:51.834
I wrote a song about him.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:56.255
Oh. Um, this may not be the time
for a musical performance.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:57.798
-Let's...

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.258
Uh, yes, Montana?

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:00.634
Pardon the interruption, June.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.011
The boys and I heard old Dwight

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.429
was scribbling up
a little warble,

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.180
so we learned ourselves
to play it.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.440
-One, two, three.

♪ Howdly-dee... ♪

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:21.864

lean and skinny,
'bout six-foot-seven;

This was on an old roll
I forgot to develop

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.376
in the glove box.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:18.087
"Self-Portrait with Shrapnel."

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.762
Do page 45.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.691
"What have you done?
How could you?"

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.150
-It says "shouting and crying."
-Uh-huh.

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.695
-So shout and cry.
-"How could you?!"

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:45.948
"How couldn't I?"

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.366
"How couldn't you?"

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:48.784
"That's what I'm asking."

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.995
"It was over already.
You were free.

01:19:50.995 --> 01:19:52.913
"What's the point
of committing suicide

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:55.541
when there's nothing left
to escape?"

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.128
"Maybe that was
the problem all along."

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:01.964
"Stares for a moment."

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.966
And then it says I smash
everything off the shelf.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:05.634
So smash everything
off the shelf.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.557
"Such a sickening waste.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:14.393
"Think of the people.
Think of the places.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:16.645
-Think of the world..."
-Use your grief.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.063
For a rehearsal?

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.565
I'm not even in this picture.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.442
I'm a war photographer.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.068
Use your grief.

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.988
All right.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.744
"Such a sickening waste.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:36.999
"Think of the people.
Think of the places.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.252
Think of the world
you could have seen, Dolores."

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.465
"I've already seen it."

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:48.135
She still is...
uh, is-is she a ghost?

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.723
It's not clear.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.808
Uh...

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.560
Then the, uh... the...

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.605
Then the coroner comes in,
orders me out of the room.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.440
I slowly turn away
and close the door.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.524
Scene.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.651
My sandwich is burning.

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.752
My daughter saw us.

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:22.753
What?

01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:24.713
Oh, uh, Dinah saw us.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.424
Through this window,
in your bedroom yesterday.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:39.353
Did you, uh, tell her
we were rehearsing again?

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.314
I didn't think of that.
I should've.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.275
But it's too late,
because I admitted everything.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.112
Did she tell Woodrow?

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:50.572
Hard to say.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.157
She can keep a secret.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.951
I don't know if she will.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.540
This isn't the beginning
of something, Augie.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.542
Isn't it?

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:03.919
Is it?

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.879
Probably not.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:07.256
Unless maybe it is.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:08.841
I don't like the way
that guy looked at us.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:10.926
-What guy?
-The alien.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.302
Oh. How did he...

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.555
-How did he look at us?
-Like we're doomed.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.268
Maybe we are.

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.441
What did you just do?

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:28.026
I burned my hand
on the Quicky-Griddle.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.112
-Why?
-It's not clear.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.281
Show me.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.783
You really did it.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.411
That actually happened.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.504
Pull.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:56.305
How long can they keep us
in Asteroid City?

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.764
Legally, I mean.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.141
Well, I'm not an attorney,

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.767
but I'd say
as long as they like.

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:02.477
I think we'd have to file
an injunction

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.229
and successfully argue
the case-- six months to a year?

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.647
Of course,
we'd also need to initiate

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.065
a civil suit for loss of income.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.817
Maybe we should just
walk out right now.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.945
I'm not sure they could stop us
without killing somebody.

01:23:11.945 --> 01:23:13.530
Interesting idea.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:16.158
What kind of mileage
you think that jet pack gets?

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.492
Ask Roger or his son.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.077
Apparently,
he's being prosecuted

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.495
for revealing state secrets.

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.456
-They'll never make it stick.
-I'm in no hurry.

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:24.499
I like the desert.
I like aliens.

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.043
-Pull.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.502
How'd you get that back?

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:28.921
The projects remain
under secure lockdown.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.297
No Stargazer is permitted
personal access

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:31.381
without the express
permission...

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.674
My son invented this death ray.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.176
That may be true,
but my orders are...

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.761
-Step back.
-Easy, fellas.

01:23:35.761 --> 01:23:37.512
-We're not in Guadalcanal
anymore. -Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:39.348
Everyone, please. It's been
a difficult quarantine.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.016
-I'll zap you right now!
-You stole your projects!

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:42.559
GIBSON
Goddamn it, tell them

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:43.936
-to stand down!
-Stand down! You hear that?

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.312
General Gibson says,
"Stand down."

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.730
-You married?
-Of course.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:48.815
We'll reconfiscate the projects
at a later time.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:50.317
Probably after dinner.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.320
Try it.

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.698
Tab Hunter, Doris Day, out,

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.784
Jack the Ripper, out,
Bing Crosby, Shirley Temple,

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.827
out, out, Orson Welles,
Lucille Ball, out,

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.038
Marlon Brando, out,
Queen Elizabeth, Mickey Mantle,

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.706
out, out, Yul Brynner,
Louis Armstrong,

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.209
out, Lana Turner, out,
Betty Grable, Ella Fitzgerald,

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.711
out, out, Rock Hudson, out,
Jerry Lewis, out, out,

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.922
Greta Garbo, Karl Marx, out,
Joan of Arc, out,

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:13.548
Charles Darwin,
Walter Pidgeon, out,

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:15.467
Emily Dickinson,
Galileo, out, out,

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.302
Pontius Pilate, out,
Ernest Hemingway, Jackie O...

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:19.429
Who's responsible for stealing
my radio telescope,

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:21.056
my signal processing receiver

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.558
and my entire spectrographical
monitoring network?

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.145
They're trying
to contact the alien.

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:30.065
Well, I appreciate that,
but what about Dr. Hickenlooper?

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:33.068
If you're trying to contact
the alien, include me.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.237
Did you hear anything
from him so far?

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:36.947
-No.
Huh.

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:38.782
What's all this?

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:41.076
I put the American flag
just to be patriotic.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.828
Now we need
to really mean something.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.830
A universal message,
not only to earthlings.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:46.957
We already thought of
everything we could think of:

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:48.667
a cross, a star,
a four-leaf clover,

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:50.252
letters, numbers, hieroglyphics.

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:52.129
What's the point of projecting
a star onto the moon?

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:53.505
-Exactly.
-I ask that sincerely.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.756
How about "E equals MC-squared"?

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.091
-I still think it's...
-They know that.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.426
-It's too easy.
-This is our chance

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:59.511
to be actually worthwhile
in our lifetimes.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:01.179
I see what you mean.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.181
-Whose turn was it?
-Oh, the middle of mine.

01:25:03.181 --> 01:25:04.850
I'd better start over.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.601
-Cleopatra, Jagadish...
-A word, Woodrow.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:09.187
About the, uh, settings
on the spectrograph.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.689
Over here, if you wouldn't mind.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.316
...Kurt Gödel,
William Henry Bragg...

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:14.359
The, uh, warning label indicates

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.153
that the, uh...

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:21.158
It's all worthwhile
in your lifetime.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.826
-This, I mean.
-Okay.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.120
Your curiosity is
your most important asset.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.455
-Trust it.
-Okay.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.040
-Trust your curiosity.
-Okay.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.125
The resources of my lab
will always be available to you.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.752
After this thing is over,
I mean.

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.754
You could maybe sort of
be my protégé, if you like.

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:35.088
Oh, wow. Maybe we can prove

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:36.423
the hypothesis
of celestial flirtation

01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:37.758
and get the math right finally.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.092
Wow. Let's try.

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:41.053
I think I see
the dots from space

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:42.846
burned into your eyeballs.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.267
I'm sorry about your mother.

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:50.187
I miss mine, too,
and she died 46 years ago.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:53.482
Thank you.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:57.277
I've already petitioned
the State Assembly

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:59.654
to change the name of the town
from Asteroid City

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.281
to Alien Landing, U.S.A.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:03.825
This municipality might end up
being the center

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:07.037
of a vast community
of Stargazers and Space Cadets.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:09.998
It's a historic offering.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.297
As you know,
the Asteroid Day itinerary

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:18.757
had to be suspended last week

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:21.259
due to the factual reality
of our circumstances.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.095
However, I have
an announcement to make.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:25.055
Dr. Hickenlooper
and the Military-Science

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:26.723
Research and Experimentation
Division,

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.600
in conjunction with
the Larkings Foundation,

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.936
have officially selected
a recipient

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.979
for this year's
Hickenlooper Scholarship,

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:36.191
and you're all going home
first thing tomorrow morning.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.276
The president has opted
to lift the quarantine

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:40.112
by executive decree.

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.366
I'd like to take
this opportunity--

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:46.493
and, by the way,
all of this year's projects,

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:47.994
setting aside my own

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:50.038
differences of opinion
with Ricky Cho,

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.541
were of the very highest
caliber, without exception--

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:55.419
-to officially declare, uh...

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.837
-What's happening now?
-Scholarship...

01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:58.213
-What's happening now?
-I don't know.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.881
It's today again.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.292
It's been inventoried.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:41.256
Under the provisions of

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:42.883
National Security
Emergency Scrimmage Plan X,

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:44.801
the lifting of the quarantine
which I just announced

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.803
is now canceled
or at least postponed

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:50.265
due to the unexpected
new event which just...

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:20.212
Why does Augie burn his hand
on the Quicky-Griddle?

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:22.506
I still don't understand
the play.

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:24.966
What?

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.228
Where are you going?

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:38.104
I'll be right back.

01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:40.065
I don't play him
as an alien, actually.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.691
I play him as a metaphor.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.443
-That's my interpretation.
-Metaphor for what?

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:46.154
I-I don't know yet.
We don't pin it down.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.240
Schubert. Schubert.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.408
-Schubert! Schubert!
-Huh? Yes.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:52.744
What's wrong? Are you on?

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:54.538
Technically, but General Gibson
just started the scene

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.331
where the president
doesn't accept his resignation.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.333
I've got six and a half minutes
before my next line.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.335
I need an answer
to a question I want to ask.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.461
Okay.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:03.421
Am I doing him right?

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:04.756
Oh.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:06.091
Well...

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:07.592
I told you before,
there's too much business--

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:08.843
with the pipe, with the lighter,

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:10.470
with the camera,
with the eyebrow--

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.597
but aside from that,
on the whole,

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.975
in answer to your question...
Sit down.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.979
You're doing him just right.

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:21.606
In fact, in my opinion,
you didn't just become Augie.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:22.941
He became you.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:24.025
I feel lost.

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.610
-Good.
-He's such a wounded guy.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.487
I feel like my heart
is getting broken--

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:28.697
my own, personal heart--

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:29.864
-every night.
-Good.

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.408
-Do I just keep doing it?
-Yes.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.201
-Without knowing anything?
-Yes.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.078
Isn't there supposed to be
some kind of an answer

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.538
out there
in the cosmic wilderness?

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:37.789
Woodrow's line
about the meaning of life.

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.082
-"Maybe there is one."
-Right.

01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:40.458
Well, that's my question.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.212
I still don't understand
the play.

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.755
Doesn't matter.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.216
Just keep telling the story.

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.385
You're doing him right.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.886
I need a breath of fresh air.

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:52.971
Huh.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.432
Okay, but you won't find one.

01:29:58.268 --> 01:29:59.853
Right.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:21.124
Hello.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:25.920
Oh. It's you, the wife
who played my actress.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.257
Hmm. My scene was cut
after one rehearsal.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.136
-We still use your photograph.
-Hmm.

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:38.475
You remember the dialogue?

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.144
No.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:45.482
We meet in a dream
on the alien's planet.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:47.359
Magnavox-27.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.944
Actually,
it's one of the moons of it.

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:54.157
You say,
"Did you talk to the alien?"

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:57.285
I say, "Not yet."

01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.038
You say, "Why not?
I thought for sure

01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:02.999
you would've yelled at him
or made him laugh."

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:07.212
I say, "Or asked him
the secrets of the universe?"

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:09.339
You say, "Exactly."

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:13.426
I say, "I think he's shy."

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:16.388
You say,

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:19.182
"So's Woodrow, but I'm sure
he'll grow out of it.

01:31:19.182 --> 01:31:22.143
I mean, at least I hope he will,
without a mother."

01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:27.482
I say, "He's a late bloomer,

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:32.779
but maybe I think
you'll need to replace me."

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:34.155
You say,

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:37.283
"What? Why? How? I can't."

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:43.164
I say, "Maybe I think
you'll need to try.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.919
I'm not coming back, Augie."

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:53.967
Then you take a picture of me
and start crying,

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.010
and I say...

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:00.682
"I hope it comes out."

01:32:03.768 --> 01:32:05.937
And I say,

01:32:05.937 --> 01:32:08.314
"All my pictures come out."

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.745
Hmm.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:23.621
Good memory. Why'd they cut it?

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.123
Running time.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:26.833
Now I'm First Lady-in-Waiting
to the Queen Consort

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:28.376
in Fruit of a Withering Vine.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.044
You missed your cue.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:32.172
June and the cowboy are already
necking in the station wagon.

01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:35.049
They're bandaging
the understudy's hand right now.

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.136
Oh. It's you.

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:39.971
We almost would've had
a scene together.

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:42.140
-Hello.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:48.146
Six months into the run,
the company received the news:

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:50.857
a catastrophic
automobile accident.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:52.984
Conrad Earp, American playwright

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.820
unequaled in passion
and imagination,

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.363
dead at 50.

01:32:57.363 --> 01:32:59.616
I'd like to make
a scene where all my characters

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.242
are each gently,
privately seduced

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.536
into the deepest, dreamiest
slumber of their lives

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.246
as a result
of their shared experience

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:08.124
of a bewildering and bedazzling
celestial mystery,

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.585
-but I don't know
how to write it. -

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.088
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.632
-What was that?

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:17.217
What's happening?

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:19.928
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.095
-What?
-That's not true.

01:33:21.095 --> 01:33:22.430
-Say it again.
-Who cares?

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.183
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:26.351
-Why should you?
-Maybe not.

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:27.852
-Of course.
-Uh, yes.

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.854
-You can't wake up...
-If you don't fall asleep.

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:32.190
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.192
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.486
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:38.947
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:38.947 --> 01:33:41.324
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.618
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.995
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:48.373
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:50.792
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:53.294
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:55.463
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:33:55.463 --> 01:33:57.799
You can't wake up if you
don't fall asleep.

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:00.927
You can't wake up
if you don't fall asleep.

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:35.753

01:34:35.753 --> 01:34:38.715
Uh, where'd they go?

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:40.925
Good morning, Mr. Steenbeck.

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.094
Juice preference, please--
apple, orange or tomato.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:44.929
Where'd they go? Everybody.

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:46.431
Of course. I understand.

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:48.433
The president lifted
the quarantine after all,

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.934
at midnight.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:51.769
He sent the whole gang home--
the troops, the cowboys,

01:34:51.769 --> 01:34:53.479
the Junior Stargazers
and Space Cadets.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:55.982
You are free to return
back to wherever you came from.

01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:57.817
We had 11 checkouts
this morning.

01:34:57.817 --> 01:34:59.861
I guess you overslept.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.779
They returned your
science projects, by the way.

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:03.406
Hmm.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.701
-Tomato.
-Right away.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:16.711
The plan was to shovel it up
and take her with us.

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:20.089
Like I said,
we'll exhume the Tupperware.

01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:22.675
We don't have any burial rights
to this plot here.

01:35:22.675 --> 01:35:24.677
I would question
whether it even is a plot.

01:35:24.677 --> 01:35:26.095
It isn't.

01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:28.181
-Don't murder my mother's ashes!
-He's killing her!

01:35:28.181 --> 01:35:30.934
No, no, no, no. Let us pray.

01:35:34.938 --> 01:35:36.481
Poppy!

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:40.610
Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank thee for the life

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:44.572
of this magnificent woman,
who was once just a little girl

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.241
like these three
witches in training.

01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:48.826
-Not in training.
-We are witches.

01:35:48.826 --> 01:35:50.453
Part witch, part alien.

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.830
Like these three witches
at one time.

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:55.750
We had no intention
of permanently burying her

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.752
next to this unmarked cactus,

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.253
but I no longer have
the strength

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:02.256
to fight for her dignity,
nor neither does Augie.

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.008
-Do you?
-No.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:07.095
So we'll defer to the wishes
of her stubborn daughters.

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:10.682
Woodrow, any final farewell?

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:12.475
I don't believe in God anymore.

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:13.893
Fair enough.

01:36:13.893 --> 01:36:16.938
-Amen.
Amen.

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.524
Friskity, triskity,
briskity, boo,

01:36:19.524 --> 01:36:22.819
knickerty, knockerty,
tockerty, too.

01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:25.113
Mama is in the ground.

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:27.448
Say the prayer for Mama.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:30.076
Mama, we'll say the prayer, too.

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:31.703
You are beautiful...

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.081
Five orders of flapjacks
and two black coffees.

01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:36.874
-Thanks.

01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:41.129
Who needs to pee?

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:42.839
-Nobody needs to pee.
-I don't. -Not me.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:44.549
How about a glass
of strawberry milk?

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.592
Mmm.
-Yes, please.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:50.763
Somebody win that scholarship?

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:52.724
I did.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:54.392
-When?
-Last night.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:57.311
General Gibson slipped it to me
in line at the communal showers.

01:36:57.311 --> 01:36:59.355
I think he just wanted
to get it over with.

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:01.733
It's actually a standard-sized
check of typical dimensions.

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:03.818
The big one's only for show.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:05.820
-Wow.
-Congratulations, Woodrow.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.196
That's, uh, stupendous.

01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:08.656
You must be
some kind of a genius.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:09.866
I agree.

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:12.493
You must be
some kind of brainiac.

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.329
Has it got any strings
attached to it?

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:16.914
It's made out to you personally.

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:18.958
How you plan to use it?

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:22.503
I'll probably spend it
on my girlfriend.

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:29.052
What do you write
in that little book?

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.180
Next year's project,
confidentially.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.265
-Gee whiz. Look at that. Whoa.
-Wow. Is that possible?

01:37:34.265 --> 01:37:36.225
-Is that possible?

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:39.604
Midge Campbell
left you her address.

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:42.440
It's just a post office box.

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:46.110
What happened
that night I saw the...

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.695
That's none of
your business, Stanley.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.447
I know. Of course it isn't.

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:51.032
I only ask because
Woodrow told me

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:52.784
-Dinah told him.
-I understand. I understand.

01:37:52.784 --> 01:37:54.285
I understand.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:56.954
I went to law school
with her former agent.

01:37:56.954 --> 01:37:59.165
Anyway, I don't object.

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:02.251
She's actually
a very gifted comedienne.

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:03.795
That's true.

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.634
