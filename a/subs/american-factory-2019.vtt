WEBVTT

04:32.605 --> 04:35.942
- How old are these houses?
-200 years?

04:36.025 --> 04:39.487
No way!
America was founded only 200 years ago.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.866
-Then at least several decades.
-Yeah, maybe.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.496
- Cold?
- Yeah.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.623
But this is really beautiful.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.208
Yeah, gorgeous.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.630
See, America's airspace is really busy.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.007
There's one.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.634
-And there.
- Mmm.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.623
Is this a union shop?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.389
Since you've arrived in America,

08:35.473 --> 08:38.017
I believe you've found
many things different

08:38.100 --> 08:39.560
from life in China.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.979
We need to get to know Americans.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.276
America is a place
to let your personality run free.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.779
As long as you're not doing
anything illegal,

08:49.862 --> 08:51.531
you're free to follow your heart.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.825
You can even joke about the president.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.036
Nobody will do anything to you.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.374
Americans' cars are big and huge,
very comfortable.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.587
This represents
the American sense of casualness.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.132
They don't place a heavy importance
on outfits and attire.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.719
If you travel in Europe in the summertime,

09:13.803 --> 09:17.181
and you see someone walking
in front of you,

09:17.431 --> 09:20.977
if he's wearing shorts,
vests, and sports shoes,

09:21.060 --> 09:23.521
they must be an American.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.149
Americans say
what they are thinking directly.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.069
They don't hide anything.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.154
They are very obvious.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.448
Everything is practical and realistic.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.536
They dislike abstraction and theory
in their daily lives.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.331
Time is limited today,
so I won't keep going.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.418
The list here is really long.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.841
As required by Chairman,

09:51.966 --> 09:56.804
we will have an opening celebration
on October 7th.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.973
From now on,

09:59.390 --> 10:04.895
I ask you to keep October 7th in mind

10:04.979 --> 10:08.733
and work hard
towards this grand celebration.

10:42.058 --> 10:46.395
This one is the Chevrolet S10.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.356
It was made in 1982.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.736
The first car from the GM plant.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.405
Wow, Dayton was very well developed
back then?

10:56.530 --> 10:59.200
Exactly. A very well developed area.

12:24.034 --> 12:29.915
Every time I visit
this plant, I see a lot of changes.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.256
You see there's still
empty space for more equipment.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.300
It will all be installed within a year.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.071
Thank you very much.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.245
He says that a lot
of people lost their jobs in this area,

13:08.329 --> 13:10.164
and he thanks you for the opportunity.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.136
So the clients are satisfied?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.972
Yes, very satisfied.
Especially Chrysler.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.559
I am pairing an American with a Chinese.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.230
The American is the main operator,
with a Chinese supervisor by their side.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.149
They're pretty slow.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.235
They have fat fingers.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.362
We keep training them over and over.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.249
It won't.

14:40.212 --> 14:44.884
In October,
the weather will be like it is today.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.391
I have an idea,
but I am not sure it's a good one.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.060
We hang two artworks here.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.064
One is something iconic of China,

15:40.147 --> 15:41.815
like the Great Wall.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.653
-The other one is from the US.
-No. Only American ones.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.196
Only American ones.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.448
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.784
Don't upset them.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.413
They haven't done
good decorative work here.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.624
This can't be here.
It should be moved to the side.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.509
David says that is the required height.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.765
We can't place it
down there. It has to be that high.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.225
We can move it to that corner.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.851
Then up there.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.065
He has to ask and see.
He knows this is the right height.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
Catch another big fish!

16:50.676 --> 16:53.012
Did you all set the bait this way?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.055
- Looks fucking cool!
- How do you set it?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.874
-Ooh, that's a big one right there.
-Big, yes.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.833
Very big.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.249
We're going home
to gut the fish, and we'll come back.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.491
Set the water temperature to 60Â°.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.286
Because it has high alkalinity.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.264
Beautiful! Beautiful!

22:29.890 --> 22:30.974
Down a little.

22:31.058 --> 22:31.892
Down a little bit!

22:32.434 --> 22:33.602
This damn thing...

22:33.685 --> 22:36.063
-Allen wrench.
- Allen. Allen.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.230
Allen wrench.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.858
-Allen wrench.
- Allen wrench.

22:44.529 --> 22:50.202
My first impression
of Ohio was how flat it is.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.123
My family's in China.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.627
Two lovely children

22:59.002 --> 23:01.254
and a beautiful wife.

23:03.632 --> 23:09.429
Fuyao offered me my first job at 18.

23:12.349 --> 23:16.228
I have worked in the furnace
for more than 20 years.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.106
It's a hard job, but I love it.

23:25.028 --> 23:29.074
Because of the language barrier
and cultural differences,

23:29.241 --> 23:34.955
it's hard to quickly integrate
everyone's ideas.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.049
I don't have much time to eat every day.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.260
So every week, I bring a box of Twinkies.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.303
This is my lunch.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.805
I eat two at a time.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.401
Look at the red sticks.
This one is broken.

24:04.484 --> 24:08.488
We have to pull it out by ourselves.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.159
Look at the scars on my arm.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.411
These are all scalds.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.912
I got burned.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.835
- Air.
- Air.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.954
Now the entire world is watching us.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.203
Good afternoon.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.604
Welcome.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.193
-Welcome to the US!

30:00.173 --> 30:05.011
Today, we hold the opening ceremony

30:05.094 --> 30:07.138
of Fuyao Glass America.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.687
Who the fuck does he think he is?

31:28.553 --> 31:32.056
The senator mentioned
the workers union in his speech.

31:32.140 --> 31:37.395
Does Fuyao have any good strategies
for avoiding these risks?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.944
Dave, there's one thing
I gotta talk to you about.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.447
-Mm-hmm.
-Regarding Sherrod Brown's comments...

32:24.776 --> 32:28.488
You all know our stand on this.

32:28.571 --> 32:32.992
We don't want to see the union
developing here.

32:37.705 --> 32:41.501
If we have a union,
it will impact our efficiency,

32:41.584 --> 32:43.127
thus hurting our company.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.714
It will create loss for us.

32:47.924 --> 32:52.428
If a union comes in, I'm shutting down.

32:54.597 --> 32:58.685
They keep interfering with my production.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.854
Slowly bleeding money is even worse
than a union.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.072
John, if you want
to continue to be president,

33:11.781 --> 33:13.533
you have to listen to my advice.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.068
It's audit day.

33:49.152 --> 33:51.446
We don't have glass to show them!

33:51.529 --> 33:53.656
We should have some ready

33:53.740 --> 33:55.366
for the customers to check.

34:34.739 --> 34:37.158
There must be some flaws
if the glass exploded.

34:38.993 --> 34:42.080
The overall quality of the glass
is not good enough,

34:42.163 --> 34:45.291
but there's no way to improve it now.
We still want to achieve our targets.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.376
One is output. The second is speed.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.128
We need one more person.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.923
Transfer someone from China here.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.989
Anything they're not happy about?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.532
It gets really hot in here.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.035
Our American colleagues
are very afraid of heat.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.747
We try to give them
the environment they want,

37:30.206 --> 37:32.750
as long as it's within
a reasonable budget.

37:34.710 --> 37:38.589
The spaces between the production lines
are pretty narrow.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.510
The Occupational Safety
& Health Administration (OSHA)

37:42.593 --> 37:43.928
thinks it's too dense.

37:44.470 --> 37:47.056
"A tall tree catches the wind."

37:47.139 --> 37:48.975
Yes, it's a huge tree.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.817
Let's welcome Chairman!

38:03.990 --> 38:05.324
Dear staff,

38:06.075 --> 38:06.909
good morning.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.664
We haven't reached our goals.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.918
This is a very tough challenge for us.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.715
We are all Chinese.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.385
We were born

38:24.760 --> 38:29.557
of Chinese mothers.

38:33.144 --> 38:38.232
No matter where you die or are buried,
you will always be Chinese.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.861
The motherland is like a mother.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.321
This is eternal.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.325
Today, Chinese come to the US
to operate factories.

38:48.951 --> 38:53.497
The most important thing
is not how much money we earn,

38:54.081 --> 38:57.960
but how this will change
Americans' views of the Chinese

38:58.586 --> 39:00.087
and towards China.

39:02.882 --> 39:08.304
Every Chinese person should do things
for our country and our people.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.060
It's down to every one of you here.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.531
<i>American workers are not efficient,</i>
<i>and output is low.</i>

39:28.949 --> 39:29.950
<i>I can't manage them.</i>

39:33.412 --> 39:36.832
<i>When we try to manage them,</i>
<i>they threaten to get help from the union.</i>

39:56.060 --> 39:58.979
<i>How can we make Americans understand</i>

39:59.563 --> 40:02.316
<i>that the Chinese can open factories</i>
<i>in America?</i>

40:04.610 --> 40:06.529
<i>This is a big problem.</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:23.063
<i>Noble sentiments</i>

41:23.147 --> 41:26.275
<i> Are transparent </i>

41:26.859 --> 41:29.904
<i> For the sake of transparency </i>

41:30.488 --> 41:33.866
<i> We've gone through difficulties </i>

41:34.116 --> 41:37.786
<i> For the sake of transparency </i>

41:37.870 --> 41:41.499
<i> We've struggled every bit </i>

41:41.582 --> 41:45.169
<i> Fuyao holds up </i>

41:45.252 --> 41:48.923
<i> A transparent world </i>

41:49.006 --> 41:52.676
<i> China is filled with spring </i>

41:52.760 --> 41:56.347
<i> And happiness is everywhere </i>

41:56.430 --> 42:00.017
<i> All the blessings from Fuyao </i>

42:00.100 --> 42:04.813
<i> Are transparent </i>

42:54.405 --> 42:56.282
Welcome home.

45:48.996 --> 45:50.205
Attention!

45:50.581 --> 45:52.249
Dress right!

45:55.419 --> 45:57.755
Keep an eye on the distance

45:58.046 --> 46:00.048
between yourself and others.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.134
Eyes front!

46:02.968 --> 46:03.802
Straddle.

46:05.429 --> 46:06.472
Hello, everyone!

46:06.555 --> 46:09.057
Good! We are good.

46:09.558 --> 46:10.476
Number off!

46:10.559 --> 46:11.393
-One.
-Two.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.311
-Three.
-Four.

46:12.394 --> 46:13.228
-Five.
-Six.

46:13.312 --> 46:14.229
-Seven.
-Eight.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.147
-Nine.
-Ten.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.064
Eleven.

46:16.148 --> 46:16.982
-Twelve.
-Thirteen.

46:17.065 --> 46:17.941
-Fourteen.
-Fifteen.

46:18.025 --> 46:18.901
-Sixteen.
-Seventeen.

46:18.984 --> 46:19.860
Eighteen.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.069
Nineteen. Report!

46:21.153 --> 46:23.530
There should be 19 people in this team,
and all 19 people are here.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.656
Over!

46:25.449 --> 46:26.533
Good afternoon.

46:26.992 --> 46:28.660
Good afternoon.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.413
- Sorry.
- Sorry! Sorry!

46:31.830 --> 46:34.124
- Please.
- Please. Please.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.460
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

46:36.835 --> 46:37.669
Attention.

46:38.253 --> 46:40.798
-Our team name is?
- Improvement!

46:41.256 --> 46:42.216
Our slogan is?

46:42.299 --> 46:44.927
To stand still is to move back!

46:45.344 --> 46:46.220
Attention!

46:50.933 --> 46:53.268
The preparation meeting is over.

46:57.439 --> 46:58.315
Dismissed.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.575
I heard things
are not going too well over there.

47:09.493 --> 47:13.163
Right. That's true.
That's why we're doing training here.

47:15.040 --> 47:18.710
You guys have eight days off
every month.

47:18.794 --> 47:20.128
You have all the weekends.

47:20.212 --> 47:22.297
Only eight hours a day.
That's an easy life.

47:22.381 --> 47:23.215
Yes.

47:23.882 --> 47:26.677
These workers only have
one or two days off per month.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.428
They're not too happy about that.

47:29.304 --> 47:34.434
That's why I told you
American workers are too lazy.

47:34.518 --> 47:37.062
It's just your nature. But you're not bad.

47:37.145 --> 47:41.900
-Every person can be changed.
-We have some extremely diligent workers.

47:41.984 --> 47:45.070
Very motivated, very ambitious.

47:45.153 --> 47:45.988
They're great.

47:46.697 --> 47:50.242
But most workers are there
just to make money,

47:50.325 --> 47:51.660
not to make glass.

47:51.743 --> 47:53.412
How many hours a day do they work?

47:53.495 --> 47:54.788
Eight hours per shift.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.583
Eight hours. So about 100 dollars a day.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.545
Here we say you have to be worthy
of your salary.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.298
You need to prove you deserve it.
You understand, right?

48:04.381 --> 48:05.591
Yes, I understand.

48:06.842 --> 48:11.263
I heard that your workers like
to joke around and talk a lot.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.683
The best tool we can use is duct tape.

48:14.766 --> 48:17.978
Put it over their mouths.
They will perform better.

48:18.061 --> 48:22.733
-Tape?
-Tape on their mouths.

48:22.816 --> 48:23.817
Can you do that there?

48:23.901 --> 48:28.238
No, we can't. But if we could do that,
we'd have improved production.

48:28.655 --> 48:31.241
Because they're too chatty now.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.161
Well, the most important thing

48:34.244 --> 48:37.915
is that<i> </i>you all should be united
and concentrate your efforts.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.719
It's not bad working here.

48:51.219 --> 48:52.387
I'm married.

48:52.679 --> 48:54.056
My child is in my hometown.

48:54.890 --> 48:58.226
We don't have many holidays,
so I don't have much time to go back home.

48:58.310 --> 49:01.188
Only during the Spring Festival,
once a year.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.775
We work 12 hours a shift.

49:08.904 --> 49:11.406
I'm tired, but I have no choice.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.328
<i>We work</i>
<i>whenever we're asked by our leader.</i>

49:17.579 --> 49:18.997
<i>I have two kids now.</i>

49:19.581 --> 49:21.833
<i>One is six months old,</i>
<i>the other is four years old.</i>

49:21.917 --> 49:22.918
<i>They're pretty young.</i>

49:23.627 --> 49:27.172
<i>If we're too busy, we may not be able</i>
<i>to take days off.</i>

49:27.923 --> 49:30.467
<i>I only go home once or twice a year.</i>

49:32.552 --> 49:36.139
<i>My older kid is eleven,</i>
<i>and the younger one is eight.</i>

49:39.267 --> 49:43.355
<i>I work long hours</i>
<i>and I spend very little time with them.</i>

50:02.708 --> 50:08.005
The glass in our factory--

50:08.839 --> 50:12.009
Different glass colors
have different values for recycling.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.302
So they have to sort the colors.

50:56.053 --> 50:59.014
We are energetic at Fuyao.

50:59.473 --> 51:04.561
All of us are energetic
and happy to work here.

51:05.395 --> 51:09.566
All of our workers
are members of the workers union.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.541
Mao Zedong,

51:27.584 --> 51:29.628
and this is Deng Xiaoping,

51:30.087 --> 51:31.338
Jiang Zemin,

51:31.505 --> 51:32.506
Hu Jintao,

51:32.839 --> 51:33.757
Xi Jinping.

51:33.840 --> 51:39.971
These are the five leaders
since China was established.

51:41.848 --> 51:46.937
Without backing from the government,
the company wouldn't get too far.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.315
Our workers union and the company

51:50.565 --> 51:53.068
are closely related to each other.

51:53.527 --> 51:57.280
They are like two gears rotating together.

51:57.364 --> 52:00.826
We need our workers
to fight for Fuyao's success.

52:00.909 --> 52:04.162
We are all in the same boat.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.790
Keeping the boat safe
means everyone is safe.

52:07.499 --> 52:11.294
If the boat sinks,
everyone loses their jobs.

52:12.003 --> 52:13.797
It's quite simple.

52:22.806 --> 52:25.267
Chairman Cao, here is a <i>hada</i> for you.

52:27.269 --> 52:31.773
Next on the red carpet will be workers
from two teams.

52:31.857 --> 52:36.027
They have won the Excellent Team award.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.196
Year 2017...

52:40.073 --> 52:41.283
"Soaring ambitions."

52:42.617 --> 52:45.245
"The spirit of craftsmanship
is all over China."

53:01.303 --> 53:06.600
Let's welcome
Chairman Cao with our warmest applause!

53:22.407 --> 53:23.825
Dear Chairman,

53:24.951 --> 53:27.037
dear colleagues,

53:27.579 --> 53:34.336
tonight is a gathering time
for our Fuyao family.

53:34.961 --> 53:38.215
Everybody performing
tonight works here at Fuyao.

53:43.386 --> 53:47.766
<i> We've cooked</i>
<i>A joyful New Year's Eve dinner </i>

53:47.849 --> 53:52.437
<i> The family is cheerful</i>
<i>The family is joyful </i>

53:52.520 --> 53:56.900
<i> We wish you radiant joy </i>

53:57.108 --> 54:01.238
<i> Happy New Year</i>
<i>We wish you an auspicious New Year </i>

54:01.821 --> 54:06.201
<i> We wish you a safe year</i>
<i>We wish your family a fortunate New Year </i>

54:06.284 --> 54:09.371
<i> May you be happy and prosperous! </i>

54:10.080 --> 54:13.792
<i> May the best come, may the worst leave </i>

54:13.875 --> 54:19.798
<i> Always be courteous and polite </i>

54:21.758 --> 54:24.719
<i> May you be happy and prosperous! </i>

54:28.890 --> 54:32.143
Come on! Two words have become
really popular recently.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.437
What are the words?

54:34.521 --> 54:36.731
Intelligence. Lean.

54:36.815 --> 54:38.358
<i> </i> <i>Intelligent and lean manufacturing</i> <i> </i>

54:38.441 --> 54:39.859
<i> </i> <i>All industries should adopt them</i> <i> </i>

54:39.985 --> 54:42.737
<i> </i> <i>Finance, service, manufacturing</i> <i> </i>

54:42.904 --> 54:44.531
<i> </i> <i>Intelligent and lean manufacturing</i> <i> </i>

54:44.614 --> 54:46.074
<i> </i> <i>Technology is developing rapidly</i> <i> </i>

54:46.157 --> 54:48.660
<i> </i> <i>The information age</i>
<i>Has already arrived...</i> <i> </i>

54:52.330 --> 54:54.457
<i> </i> <i>Employee relations system is amazing</i> <i> </i>

54:54.582 --> 54:56.751
<i> </i> <i>Great at resource integration</i>
<i>And market response </i>

54:57.168 --> 54:59.212
<i> Waste eliminated</i>
<i>And revenues generated </i>

54:59.713 --> 55:02.674
<i> Transition, upgrade</i>
<i>Promotion, integration </i>

55:02.757 --> 55:04.342
<i> A corporation with lean manufacturing </i>

55:04.426 --> 55:11.182
<i> Fuyao is creating a new future! </i>

56:53.993 --> 56:55.995
Please hold the hand of your bride.

56:57.664 --> 56:58.998
From this moment on,

56:59.082 --> 57:00.834
no matter poor or rich,

57:01.292 --> 57:04.254
you will always care for her, support her

57:04.337 --> 57:06.297
cherish her, and protect her,

57:06.673 --> 57:07.715
until forever.

57:07.799 --> 57:08.842
Will you?

57:08.925 --> 57:10.552
Yes, I will.

58:26.794 --> 58:29.297
- Aren't watermelons sweet?
- Sweet!

58:31.257 --> 58:35.011
Choose the best picture
to put on the cover

58:35.094 --> 58:37.013
-of the next edition of <i>Fuyao People!</i>

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:57.528
I'm worried about my points.

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:03.201
I don't wanna lose my job.

1:01:05.411 --> 1:01:06.245
-What's that?
-My pay?

1:01:07.246 --> 1:01:08.081
It's covered?

1:04:14.433 --> 1:04:18.020
When we had this training in private,

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:20.857
I was horrified by this picture.

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:25.528
If this becomes reality,

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:28.865
we wouldn't be able
to communicate directly

1:04:28.948 --> 1:04:32.159
with our American coworkers.

1:04:34.161 --> 1:04:35.288
Isn't that terrible?

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:54.891
If we are able to improve
our management capabilities,

1:04:54.974 --> 1:04:58.269
it will help quell the union rebellion.

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:10.656
<i>We hired Americans to work</i>
<i>as our managers and supervisors.</i>

1:05:12.283 --> 1:05:16.746
<i>Our expectation was</i>
<i>that we could trust them,</i>

1:05:16.996 --> 1:05:20.875
<i>pay them a high salary,</i>
<i>and they would serve the company.</i>

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.258
<i>Why didn't they?</i>

1:05:31.302 --> 1:05:35.890
<i>I think they are hostile to Chinese.</i>

1:05:39.727 --> 1:05:44.190
The loss from January to October

1:05:44.273 --> 1:05:47.860
is about 40 million US dollars.

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:52.615
We have to reverse the tide
as soon as possible.

1:05:53.407 --> 1:05:55.701
With the new restructuring,

1:05:55.785 --> 1:05:58.663
I believe we will see this plant
in profit very soon.

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:02.750
We've invited Jeff Liu
to be our new president.

1:06:09.090 --> 1:06:11.300
Good morning, everyone.

1:06:12.093 --> 1:06:18.015
I was born in 1963,
in the Year of the Rabbit.

1:06:19.433 --> 1:06:22.228
I've spent 27 years in the US
and 26 years in China.

1:06:23.521 --> 1:06:27.108
People always guess I am in my 40s,
but I'm actually 53.

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.819
Why is that? Because I have passion.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:32.321
I have determination to do things well.

1:08:27.728 --> 1:08:28.938
Not bad.

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:35.402
He asked if you want a hat.

1:08:39.782 --> 1:08:41.283
Here you go, boss.

1:08:43.619 --> 1:08:45.746
Let me wear a hat.

1:09:46.182 --> 1:09:47.808
Mmm. Smells good.

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:13.209
This is the most enjoyable moment
in a day.

1:10:13.292 --> 1:10:17.838
After I finish the cigarette,
my mind just calms down.

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:25.512
We workers lay down tracks

1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:29.767
so the train can run smoothly.

1:10:31.852 --> 1:10:36.482
The only thing we have in mind
is to do our best.

1:10:36.565 --> 1:10:39.944
That's true for everyone here.

1:10:41.946 --> 1:10:42.947
My wife.

1:10:47.117 --> 1:10:49.245
My toothache has gone.

1:10:49.870 --> 1:10:53.332
I've fully recovered.

1:11:08.555 --> 1:11:10.557
The last time I cried, I was a teenager.

1:11:11.517 --> 1:11:14.561
But I cried once after coming here.

1:11:16.730 --> 1:11:18.857
I don't dare mention that to other people.

1:11:22.194 --> 1:11:26.448
But when all is quiet
in the dead of night,

1:11:28.575 --> 1:11:32.746
I miss my family.

1:12:36.727 --> 1:12:38.896
My supervisor started yelling at me.

1:12:48.822 --> 1:12:51.116
He said he expects us
to do eight boxes at a time.

1:13:06.215 --> 1:13:07.049
I have.

1:13:07.132 --> 1:13:08.217
He knows.

1:13:21.355 --> 1:13:23.607
You need some skills to handle Americans.

1:13:24.024 --> 1:13:26.985
How can we take advantage
of American characteristics

1:13:27.444 --> 1:13:29.571
to make them work for Fuyao?

1:13:30.906 --> 1:13:33.951
There's a culture in the US

1:13:34.034 --> 1:13:38.372
where children
are showered with encouragement.

1:13:38.831 --> 1:13:44.086
So everyone who grows up in the US
is overconfident.

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:47.464
They are super confident.

1:13:49.174 --> 1:13:52.177
Americans love being flattered to death.

1:13:53.137 --> 1:13:55.806
You will get into trouble
if you fight with them.

1:13:56.723 --> 1:14:00.269
"Donkeys like being touched
in the direction their hair grows."

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:02.020
Right?

1:14:03.230 --> 1:14:06.275
You should touch donkeys
in the direction their hair grows.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:07.734
Otherwise, they'll kick you.

1:14:08.902 --> 1:14:11.447
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You do? Okay.

1:14:12.406 --> 1:14:16.910
We need to use our wisdom
to guide them and help them.

1:14:16.994 --> 1:14:18.495
Because we are better than them.

1:17:38.904 --> 1:17:42.407
I've asked security to come escort you out
if you're going to do that.

1:18:10.394 --> 1:18:12.896
Man, they treat these people
like shit in there.

1:18:26.159 --> 1:18:29.454
If there are things your boss
can't fix for you, come talk to me.

1:18:30.122 --> 1:18:32.290
Especially how to manage American workers.

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.628
Can we force them to work overtime?

1:18:36.712 --> 1:18:38.755
Americans?

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:40.924
From HR's perspective,

1:18:41.717 --> 1:18:44.594
we can't force them to work overtime.

1:18:45.470 --> 1:18:47.180
We can't say anything like that.

1:18:47.723 --> 1:18:50.976
But in China, it's mandatory.

1:18:51.059 --> 1:18:54.062
The Americans...
I don't give a shit what they think.

1:18:54.146 --> 1:18:55.897
Go ahead and sue me,

1:18:55.981 --> 1:18:58.066
but they should come the hell in
on Saturdays!

1:18:58.150 --> 1:19:00.026
That's how I would do it.

1:19:22.632 --> 1:19:27.554
I think the most
important thing is mutual understanding.

1:19:30.307 --> 1:19:34.728
We're under enormous pressure here.

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:38.398
A lot more pressure than in China.

1:19:39.733 --> 1:19:44.529
There was a guy who
couldn't fall asleep for a couple of days.

1:19:48.408 --> 1:19:49.868
I really admire Americans.

1:19:49.951 --> 1:19:51.369
They can work two jobs.

1:19:51.870 --> 1:19:54.331
They can have another job
besides working here.

1:19:56.124 --> 1:19:59.044
I always thought Americans lived
a comfortable and superior life.

1:19:59.127 --> 1:20:04.549
I thought they didn't have
to make any sacrifices.

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:19.817
I know
there are some union activists here.

1:27:19.901 --> 1:27:24.530
I know because I have people

1:27:25.406 --> 1:27:26.491
who spy for me.

1:27:26.574 --> 1:27:30.870
I have many different ways
to deal with them.

1:27:30.954 --> 1:27:33.206
Here is one. He is pro-union.

1:27:34.874 --> 1:27:39.462
This is him. This person here.

1:27:41.506 --> 1:27:44.550
Look, we get along pretty well.

1:27:45.385 --> 1:27:47.929
You won't see him here
in two weeks' time.

1:28:00.024 --> 1:28:01.484
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

1:28:01.567 --> 1:28:03.403
<i>I want to thank you so much for coming.</i>

1:28:03.486 --> 1:28:05.321
<i>I know you didn't have a choice.</i>

1:28:10.368 --> 1:28:13.329
<i>The union will go out of their way</i>

1:28:13.413 --> 1:28:15.456
<i>to try to convince you</i>
<i>that it's a good thing for you</i>

1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:17.375
<i>and that it is in your best interest.</i>

1:28:18.042 --> 1:28:19.877
<i>The contract that you get,</i>

1:28:19.961 --> 1:28:21.296
<i>if you get one,</i>

1:28:21.629 --> 1:28:23.923
<i>might include better wages and benefits.</i>

1:28:24.007 --> 1:28:27.677
<i>That contract might include the same wages</i>
<i>and benefits you have today.</i>

1:28:28.344 --> 1:28:33.641
<i>And that contract finally might include</i>
<i>less wages and less benefits.</i>

1:28:35.018 --> 1:28:38.604
<i>And the threat of a strike</i>
<i>is no longer scary to employers,</i>

1:28:38.688 --> 1:28:42.650
<i>because today if you go on strike,</i>
<i>while you can't get fired, </i>

1:28:43.109 --> 1:28:45.820
<i>the employer has the right</i>
<i>to permanently replace you.</i>

1:28:47.196 --> 1:28:48.489
<i>I'll let that sink in.</i>

1:28:49.949 --> 1:28:54.120
<i>You can't get fired for going on strike,</i>
<i>but you can get permanently replaced.</i>

1:28:54.996 --> 1:28:57.415
<i>So are you telling us</i>
<i>not to vote for the union?</i>

1:28:57.498 --> 1:28:59.417
<i>I'm here to tell you to do what you want.</i>

1:29:00.710 --> 1:29:02.545
<i>I got a question. Who do you work for?</i>

1:29:02.628 --> 1:29:05.006
<i>I work for a company called</i>
<i>Labor Relations Institute.</i>

1:29:05.089 --> 1:29:06.507
<i>We're a labor consulting firm.</i>

1:29:06.591 --> 1:29:08.676
- <i>Is the company paying you?</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Yes.</i>

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.678
<i>Didn't I say that?</i>
<i>I usually say that in every meeting.</i>

1:29:10.762 --> 1:29:12.347
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>No, you didn't say that yet.</i>

1:29:12.430 --> 1:29:15.600
<i>Well, the reality is,</i>
<i>they pay me to consult with you here--</i>

1:29:15.683 --> 1:29:17.310
<i>They pay you to talk to us?</i>

1:29:17.393 --> 1:29:20.229
<i>They pay me. They don't pay me</i>
<i>enough to stand up here and lie to you.</i>

1:32:55.236 --> 1:32:58.447
I think I need to make
only two more trips this year,

1:32:58.531 --> 1:33:01.701
if you achieve what you planned.

1:33:02.243 --> 1:33:05.454
Why do I need to come here?
It's not convenient for me. Right?

1:33:05.871 --> 1:33:08.541
You think I like to come to America
every month?

1:33:08.833 --> 1:33:10.668
It's tiring.

1:33:12.378 --> 1:33:14.797
Is the union making any noise?

1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:16.674
No, not too much.

1:33:16.799 --> 1:33:18.217
Better than it was before.

1:33:18.342 --> 1:33:22.763
Recently,
we fired a lot of union supporters.

1:33:25.016 --> 1:33:28.144
We have tried different ways.
It's worked out.

1:33:28.227 --> 1:33:30.021
A lot of active ones left--

1:33:30.104 --> 1:33:32.648
Then you guys should hire
more excellent people.

1:33:32.732 --> 1:33:33.774
Young people.

1:33:35.735 --> 1:33:37.403
This is the culture I want
for our company.

1:33:37.486 --> 1:33:40.197
- Mmm.
-Then we will have a good atmosphere here.

1:33:42.742 --> 1:33:46.370
A lot of things here in the US
are different from China.

1:33:46.454 --> 1:33:50.249
Well, we've invested here already.
It's just not working that well.

1:34:42.510 --> 1:34:44.595
We all have a psychological shadow.<i> </i>

1:34:44.679 --> 1:34:48.057
Fuyao doesn't want to be controlled
by the union.

1:34:50.851 --> 1:34:52.603
As the Chinese saying goes,

1:34:53.771 --> 1:34:55.606
"One mountain cannot hold two tigers."

1:35:21.882 --> 1:35:23.968
<i>We won by a landslide.</i>

1:35:25.344 --> 1:35:27.221
We won 60%?

1:35:27.722 --> 1:35:28.597
<i>Right.</i>

1:35:28.681 --> 1:35:30.266
We're awesome!

1:35:51.579 --> 1:35:53.456
Before we started having those trainings,

1:38:03.669 --> 1:38:05.629
The smooth operation of our US project

1:38:05.713 --> 1:38:08.632
has laid a solid foundation
for our global strategy.

1:38:11.010 --> 1:38:14.471
We've achieved double-digit growth
in operation management.

1:38:14.555 --> 1:38:17.266
Both our earnings and profits
have reached new digits.

1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:28.777
<i>The China of my youth was poor</i>

1:38:28.861 --> 1:38:32.615
<i>and undeveloped.</i>

1:38:34.825 --> 1:38:37.786
<i>I feel I was happier then.</i>

1:38:39.371 --> 1:38:42.291
<i>Now I live in a new era</i>

1:38:42.374 --> 1:38:47.546
<i>of prosperity and modernity,</i>

1:38:49.882 --> 1:38:53.344
<i>but I have a sense of loss.</i>

1:38:59.850 --> 1:39:06.273
<i>I miss the croaking frogs</i>
<i>and chirping bugs of my childhood.</i>

1:39:06.398 --> 1:39:10.653
<i>The wild flowers blooming in the field.</i>

1:39:13.822 --> 1:39:17.701
<i>In the past few decades,</i>
<i>I have built so many factories.</i>

1:39:18.202 --> 1:39:24.750
<i>Have I taken the peace away</i>
<i>and destroyed the environment?</i>

1:39:27.628 --> 1:39:33.008
<i>I don't know if I am a contributor</i>
<i>or a sinner.</i>

1:39:40.182 --> 1:39:41.141
<i>But...</i>

1:39:42.434 --> 1:39:45.896
<i>I only think that way when I'm unhappy.</i>

1:39:53.737 --> 1:39:56.240
<i>The point of living is to work.</i>

1:40:00.661 --> 1:40:01.912
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

1:40:46.165 --> 1:40:48.876
I don't have any food for you.

1:40:49.835 --> 1:40:51.545
I have some watermelon in my apartment.

1:40:54.757 --> 1:40:56.175
I don't think he can eat fruit.

1:40:56.258 --> 1:40:57.926
He can eat grass.

1:41:08.145 --> 1:41:12.024
In the old days,
all Chinese people wanted in life

1:41:12.107 --> 1:41:14.943
was to have enough food
and to raise their kids.

1:41:15.027 --> 1:41:17.654
That's all they wanted.

1:41:23.327 --> 1:41:26.413
When it comes to my generation,
we want it all.

1:41:28.207 --> 1:41:33.837
We travel wherever we want
and buy whatever we like.

1:43:16.523 --> 1:43:18.483
We used to have one person here.

1:43:18.942 --> 1:43:20.360
Now we don't have anyone.

1:43:20.944 --> 1:43:23.906
Next, I'm going to get rid
of four workers here.

1:43:24.072 --> 1:43:26.074
Two for each line.

1:43:28.118 --> 1:43:31.038
Automation means standardization.

1:43:31.496 --> 1:43:32.623
After we finish this,

1:43:32.706 --> 1:43:36.126
we will have two fewer workers
uploading on the encapsulation line.

1:43:36.210 --> 1:43:38.170
The mechanical arms do that instead.

1:43:38.962 --> 1:43:40.464
You have already finished that?

1:43:40.547 --> 1:43:41.840
Yes. These are all automatic.

1:43:41.924 --> 1:43:43.884
And you're replacing the rest
with mechanical arms too?

1:43:43.967 --> 1:43:46.595
Yes. I will replace the ones
on side-window tempering.

1:43:48.222 --> 1:43:49.556
This one is being tested now.

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:52.309
We're hoping to cancel four workers
in July or August.

1:43:53.101 --> 1:43:54.978
I'll change that into machine work.

1:43:55.395 --> 1:43:57.522
We can't get the work done now.
They are too slow.
