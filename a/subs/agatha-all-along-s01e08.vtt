WEBVTT

00:11.750 --> 00:12.791
How were you bound?

00:12.875 --> 00:14.000
It was a trap.

00:14.083 --> 00:16.166
I still don't know how he did it.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.166
Bound me without magick.

00:18.666 --> 00:20.375
[Billy] I know how people feel about her.

00:20.458 --> 00:23.458
[Jen] She traded her kid
for the Book of the Damned.

00:23.541 --> 00:25.375
They say no one knows
what happened to him.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.958
Wait, Wanda and Vision have kids?

00:27.041 --> 00:29.000
-Twins.
-What were their names?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.125
Billy and Tommy.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.750
I think they got sucked up
into that red bubble

00:33.833 --> 00:35.458
like everything else Wanda made.

00:35.541 --> 00:39.083
Don't you dare feel guilty
about your talent.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.541
You saw an opportunity and you moved in.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.291
-Tommy!
-You survived.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.541
That's what kept you alive.
That's what makes you a witch.

00:47.333 --> 00:51.083
[Billy] He's out there somewhere.
I can sense him. I just can't find him.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.458
[grunts]

00:54.083 --> 00:55.833
Don't you want me at my best?

00:55.916 --> 00:57.000
So take my power.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.458
That's cute.
But you know that would kill me.

01:00.666 --> 01:03.541
[Lilia] Rio is Death.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.166
It's time to go.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.583
Where?

02:29.333 --> 02:30.333
That's it?

02:32.708 --> 02:35.541
That's all the...
That's all the time I get?

02:36.583 --> 02:39.083
[chuckles] If I had a nickel...

02:39.166 --> 02:41.333
This can't be the end.
It has to be the beginning.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.583
[Alice] I finally broke the curse.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.250
I mean, I can really do something
with my life now.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.208
You're a Protection Witch.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.291
You died protecting someone.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.333
You ready?

03:14.083 --> 03:15.083
No.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.500
[Jen] No! Lilia! Lilia!

03:48.000 --> 03:50.708
No! Lilia!

03:51.291 --> 03:52.750
Lilia! Lilia!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.125
[Billy] What happened? Where is she?

03:54.208 --> 03:56.333
-Inside. She stayed behind to...
-[wood creaking]

03:58.958 --> 03:59.958
Lilia?

04:00.541 --> 04:02.458
No. No.

04:04.916 --> 04:06.541
No.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.291
[Jen sobs]

04:12.375 --> 04:14.250
-[â™ª tense music playing]
-[breathing heavily]

04:36.333 --> 04:38.291
Your coven is shrinking.

04:41.541 --> 04:43.583
First Alice, now Lilia.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.666
It's nice she took
the Salem Seven with her.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.083
The bodies are really piling up.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.916
Just like you promised.

04:53.916 --> 04:54.916
Did you doubt me?

04:56.083 --> 04:57.083
I did.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.458
Yeah. Thought there'd be a trick
in there somewhere.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.500
And there was.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.291
You were distracting me from him.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.500
You're a big girl.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.083
I knew you'd figure it out eventually.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.958
He is an abomination.

05:20.750 --> 05:24.083
He is disrupting the sacred balance.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.791
And I know how you feel about him.

05:28.958 --> 05:30.916
Oh, please. I've known that kid
for two minutes.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.500
I watch you, Agatha.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.708
Just as closely
as you watch everyone else.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.875
This walk with another woman's son
on a road

05:40.958 --> 05:42.083
-that doesn't--
-Stop!

05:45.958 --> 05:49.625
No one in history has had
special treatment like you.

05:52.416 --> 05:56.458
You call what you did "special treatment"?

05:59.958 --> 06:01.041
You gave me nothing.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.458
You took.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.000
And that's usually your move?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.500
Why do you let them believe
those things about you, hmm?

06:15.500 --> 06:16.500
About Nicky?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.125
Because the truth is too awful.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.291
[Billy] Lilia wanted to stay behind.

06:37.583 --> 06:38.916
She chose it. You're sure?

06:40.458 --> 06:41.458
Yeah, I'm sure.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.541
She did it for us.

06:47.791 --> 06:48.791
Rio.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.791
Green Witch with a capital G.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.291
She told us who she was
in the very beginning.

06:57.958 --> 07:01.041
Green Craft is about the cycle
of all living things.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.125
Growth and decay in constant flow.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.333
It makes sense.

07:07.416 --> 07:12.083
So Agatha's ex is Death.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.416
That also makes sense.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.125
Where is Agatha?

07:23.458 --> 07:25.500
What he wants from The Road
is a violation.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.250
Finding his brother?

07:29.416 --> 07:32.291
It's borderline wasting The Road's time.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.791
[Rio] His brother isn't out there.

07:35.416 --> 07:36.416
Not yet, anyway.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.416
What do you mean?

07:41.083 --> 07:44.625
The son of the Scarlet Witch stole
a second life.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.666
I can't let him do the same for his twin.
I have to take him.

07:49.666 --> 07:52.375
[sighs] Then take him.

08:03.916 --> 08:04.958
You can't.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.541
If Billy is killed,
he'll reincarnate again,

08:10.625 --> 08:11.791
and then you'll lose him.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.083
You need him to...

08:17.625 --> 08:18.625
turn himself in.

08:26.708 --> 08:27.791
I can arrange that.

08:29.958 --> 08:34.166
I can get him to the finish line
and deliver him to you.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.666
In exchange for...

08:48.125 --> 08:49.708
If I deliver Billy,

08:52.416 --> 08:54.125
you let me go.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.375
You will eventually die,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.833
-Agatha.
-But I want you to stop pursuing me.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.666
I want you to stop making my life hell.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.750
And when I die,

09:11.166 --> 09:16.583
a long, long, long,
long, long time from now,

09:19.208 --> 09:20.416
I don't wanna see your face.

09:39.333 --> 09:40.416
Okay.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.958
I mean, how did they even meet?

10:43.875 --> 10:48.833
Um, over corpses, I imagine.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.958
More proof that Agatha has feelings.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.208
That was your takeaway?

10:54.541 --> 10:56.250
I do not understand your loyalty to her.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.125
It's not loyalty. It's analysis.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.375
Oh, look who grew up.

10:59.958 --> 11:01.708
I'm fully aware that Agatha Harkness

11:01.791 --> 11:04.041
can never be anything
but a coven-less witch.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.291
[Agatha] Ouch!

11:08.833 --> 11:10.166
Time to finish The Road.

11:15.416 --> 11:20.458
One trial left until
the big score. [cackles]

11:20.541 --> 11:22.750
Earth magick with no Green Witch.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.000
We're back to square one.

11:25.125 --> 11:31.625
Oh, there's plenty of overlap between
Earth and Potions, right, Jenny Kale?

11:32.500 --> 11:33.958
-Some.
-[Agatha] Please.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.291
Your last name is a vegetable. Worst kind.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.250
It's like swallowing a doily.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.500
I have to be honest. I'm surprised
you survived this long, Kale.

11:44.583 --> 11:45.583
My money was on Lilia.

11:47.708 --> 11:52.041
What fresh horrors await us!
It's the big finish, after all.

11:52.125 --> 11:56.041
Get ready for fireworks!
Get ready for spectacle! Get ready for--

11:56.125 --> 11:57.583
[groans]

12:03.875 --> 12:04.875
Our shoes.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.083
We're back where we started.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.041
The Witches' Road is a circle.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.000
And this is the finish line?

12:17.708 --> 12:18.750
[gasps]

12:21.875 --> 12:22.875
That's it?

12:31.166 --> 12:32.750
[yells] That's it?

12:33.583 --> 12:35.083
Well, maybe we passed the trial.

12:36.333 --> 12:40.083
Then how exactly do we get off?

12:40.166 --> 12:42.958
-Well, maybe we--
-If you don't know, then keep quiet!

12:47.583 --> 12:48.916
[grunting in desperation]

12:58.083 --> 13:00.000
We keep going.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.750
What?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We go again. It'll work the second time.

13:06.125 --> 13:10.125
There is absolutely zero chance
I'm going to endure that experience again.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.333
Fine! Stay here!

13:22.041 --> 13:24.833
What are you gonna do? Have them bronzed?

13:26.375 --> 13:28.625
We took them off
out of respect for The Road.

13:29.833 --> 13:30.916
Screw The Road.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.416
Hello?

13:58.375 --> 14:00.916
Hello! Hello!

14:04.958 --> 14:05.958
What in the...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.958
-Ugh!
-The shoes.

14:15.375 --> 14:18.125
[yelps] Help! What is this?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.208
-Let me out!
-Don't steal her struggle.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.333
Let me out! [gasps]

14:27.125 --> 14:28.166
Where are we?

14:28.458 --> 14:34.125
Uh... Oh. My basement. Give or take.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
We are?

14:36.583 --> 14:38.416
There's not much of an earth vibe in here.

14:39.416 --> 14:40.500
No place like home.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.083
[Jen] It's sealed.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.166
These are grow lights.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.500
Are we supposed to grow something?

14:50.583 --> 14:53.416
In a place with no soil or water?

14:54.583 --> 14:58.416
It certainly has the irritating sting
of a Witches' Road trial.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.458
But we do have our personal effects.

15:11.833 --> 15:15.125
[sighs in relief] That's better.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.125
It's worthless.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.291
Well, The Road agrees.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.166
And now we have our countdown.

15:40.708 --> 15:41.708
You seem relaxed.

15:41.791 --> 15:42.791
Usually at this point

15:42.875 --> 15:47.000
you're either complaining loudly
or freaking out loudly.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.375
I'm thinking.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.625
Oh. About what?

15:49.708 --> 15:50.958
How to save your ass.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.250
Pardon?

15:54.125 --> 15:55.125
I couldn't save Lilia.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.875
I didn't even try to save Alice.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.583
I'll be damned
if I let you two idiots die.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.666
Wow. Such purpose.

16:06.750 --> 16:09.000
How are you gonna do that
without any magick?

16:09.500 --> 16:10.750
[Billy] She saved my life.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.416
She saved you from poisoning.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.750
All while bound.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.416
Maybe you don't need it.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.500
Well, if that's true, that means
I've wasted the last century of my life.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.375
That doctor in Boston didn't take
anything from me.

16:28.458 --> 16:29.458
I gave it up.

16:34.541 --> 16:35.625
Agatha?

16:36.833 --> 16:37.916
[Agatha] Nothing.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.083
What?

16:40.666 --> 16:44.291
No, I just never knew
you ever passed through there. That's all.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.250
Are you the one who bound me?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.458
I don't know.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.083
-What?
-You nonstop sociopath!

16:55.166 --> 16:56.625
-[scoffs]
-You're the one who bound her?

16:56.708 --> 17:00.083
You kept me like this for 100 years?

17:00.166 --> 17:01.333
I didn't know it was you!

17:01.416 --> 17:05.666
It was the 1920s.
I did the odd spell for bank notes.

17:06.208 --> 17:09.333
I don't know. The patriarchy
really shelled out to shush a lady.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.791
It was bind or burn!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.791
One hundred years!

17:12.875 --> 17:14.000
This is so awkward.

17:15.125 --> 17:19.000
Ow! Oh, God! Jen, that is my hair!

17:19.083 --> 17:20.750
Why are you doing this right...

17:20.833 --> 17:22.875
Look at where we are. Jen!

17:23.458 --> 17:24.583
The unbinding ritual.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.458
I deny your power over me.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.291
Attagirl. Good for you.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.208
-Agatha.
-You hold nothing.

17:34.791 --> 17:36.708
Say it like you mean it, though, Jen.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.583
You hold nothing.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.500
-Yeah, well...
-You hold nothing.

17:43.041 --> 17:45.125
You hold nothing.

17:45.625 --> 17:49.458
You hold nothing. You hold nothing.

17:50.041 --> 17:53.791
You hold nothing. You hold nothing.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.916
You hold nothing. You hold nothing.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.416
You hold nothing. You hold...

18:03.000 --> 18:04.458
nothing.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.875
[gasps]

18:27.708 --> 18:29.541
[sobbing]

18:59.666 --> 19:02.875
What happened? Where did she go?
She was just there. Agatha?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.791
The Road gave her what she was missing.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.125
And now she's gone.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.291
This can end right here, right now.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.875
I came here for power. You have power.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.125
Juice me up.

19:20.208 --> 19:23.041
So you get what you're missing
and I'm left here to rot?

19:23.125 --> 19:25.458
Or worse. You take all my power.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.791
-I wouldn't.
-Liar!

19:28.375 --> 19:29.708
-I won't.
-Liar.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.208
-Sit down.
-Why?

19:39.458 --> 19:40.708
We're gonna find your brother.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.333
What?

19:47.833 --> 19:49.458
That's what you want, right?

19:52.208 --> 19:53.833
Tommy isn't waiting out there.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.041
Not in a body, anyway.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.708
That's what got Rio in such a tizzy.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.791
She knows you could do it for him.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.375
Do what?

20:06.458 --> 20:08.000
Give him another life!

20:09.083 --> 20:11.250
Another spin around the dance floor.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.666
You think I can bring him back?

20:18.500 --> 20:19.625
I don't know how I did it.

20:20.625 --> 20:21.625
You never do.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.625
Time to grow up.

20:24.708 --> 20:25.958
[smacks floor]

20:36.625 --> 20:37.833
Close your eyes.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.416
Your last moments with Tommy.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.708
-Tell me.
-I don't remember anything.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.791
You do.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.166
It's there. Try.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.416
You were ten. You lived in Westview.

20:59.416 --> 21:00.541
You and your brother.

21:01.416 --> 21:02.458
[Vision] Your mother and I...

21:03.416 --> 21:04.791
are very proud of you both.

21:05.291 --> 21:08.625
[Wanda] Boys, thanks for choosing me
to be your mom.

21:09.791 --> 21:10.791
I was...

21:12.291 --> 21:13.375
about to fall asleep.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.375
I realize I'm breathing
at the same time as Tommy.

21:19.958 --> 21:23.125
He's not snoring, but...
It's heavy enough to listen to.

21:25.875 --> 21:26.875
It's nice.

21:29.041 --> 21:31.125
That feeling
when your body knows it's safe.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.208
Breathe with him.

21:34.541 --> 21:39.333
[breathes deeply]

21:40.958 --> 21:42.000
Breathe.

21:45.708 --> 21:48.791
The sound of him.
It stops because everything else does.

21:50.291 --> 21:53.458
It's your mother folding her world.
That's okay. It's okay.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.916
[Vision] We have said goodbye before,

21:55.000 --> 21:56.458
so it stands to reason...

21:56.541 --> 21:57.666
We'll say hello again.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.500
You keep breathing.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.333
Even if you can't hear him,

22:05.416 --> 22:09.333
you don't have to open your eyes
to know how close he is.

22:10.541 --> 22:11.750
Breathing together.

22:18.291 --> 22:21.250
You breathe for yourself.
You breathe for him.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.208
You breathe for everything he is.

22:23.791 --> 22:27.083
You hold it all inside of you.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.041
But it can't stay there.

22:30.791 --> 22:33.833
The memories. The feelings.

22:33.916 --> 22:38.875
You can't keep them.
Keep your eyes closed no matter what.

22:43.125 --> 22:44.666
You can't keep him.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.541
-So where does he go?
-I don't know!

22:47.625 --> 22:48.916
Find him a place.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.083
It's black. There's nothing.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.291
He floats. He looks down.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.916
-What does he see?
-[panting] He's afraid.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.041
But he has you with him now.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.500
I can't find a place.

22:58.583 --> 23:02.041
Don't give me that.
120 bodies empty out every minute.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.416
Find one.

23:08.916 --> 23:11.875
It's underwater! There's a boy.
It's a prank. They tricked him.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.666
He's gonna drown.

23:17.416 --> 23:19.916
-It's a bad place.
-It usually is.

23:20.458 --> 23:23.416
And the people, the family, there's no one
to love him! He's got no one!

23:24.375 --> 23:28.166
Agatha, am I killing this boy
so my brother can live?

23:28.791 --> 23:30.166
[screams]

23:39.041 --> 23:40.041
No, Billy.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.375
Sometimes...

23:57.708 --> 23:59.208
boys die.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.875
[â™ª melancholy music playing]

24:51.583 --> 24:54.750
Out of death, life...

25:16.708 --> 25:17.708
Okay.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.333
No. No.

25:21.166 --> 25:23.416
No, I need more time. I need more time!

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Please.

25:31.708 --> 25:32.708
Please.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.375
Please.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.791
[whimpers and sobs]

25:49.875 --> 25:51.416
[exclaims excitedly]

25:54.125 --> 25:55.416
There.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.541
[machinery cranking]

26:01.375 --> 26:06.375
[gasps and screams]

26:12.083 --> 26:14.750
Let me out! Let me out!

26:14.833 --> 26:17.708
I played by your rules
and I passed the last trial!

26:18.208 --> 26:20.708
Get me off The Road!

26:21.250 --> 26:22.625
[door opening]

26:45.791 --> 26:48.625
[Rio cackles]

26:48.708 --> 26:52.416
Congratulations, my love! [cackles]

26:55.375 --> 26:57.833
I'm sorry I didn't have a ribbon
for you to run through.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.125
Where is it?

27:05.333 --> 27:09.916
I want my prize!

27:10.458 --> 27:12.833
So do I.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.375
I got you the kid out, as agreed!

27:18.958 --> 27:20.250
And he's now where?

27:21.791 --> 27:24.208
He was supposed to surrender himself.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.666
That means you're coming with me.

27:29.208 --> 27:33.083
I'm thinking death by a thousand cuts!

27:33.166 --> 27:35.041
[Agatha screams]

27:36.125 --> 27:37.958
[Rio cackles]

27:41.750 --> 27:42.750
Oh.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.458
Is it happening again?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.791
I don't know.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Fire phase.

28:00.708 --> 28:01.958
[chanting in Latin]

28:03.375 --> 28:05.125
Expel this evil.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.041
You're calling me "evil"?

28:09.583 --> 28:13.083
I am the natural order
of all things, baby.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.791
And you love me.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.250
[blows]

28:21.000 --> 28:24.333
You are a coward!

28:24.916 --> 28:28.125
"When she calls you a coward,
hit the deck."

28:31.958 --> 28:35.416
-[grunts]
-Why don't you want me?

28:35.708 --> 28:38.041
-[thunder rumbles]
-[grunts]

28:38.458 --> 28:39.875
[Agatha screams]

28:43.000 --> 28:44.083
Huh?

28:45.458 --> 28:46.708
[groans]

28:47.625 --> 28:48.958
[chanting in Latin]

29:15.625 --> 29:17.375
[grunts]

29:41.125 --> 29:42.166
You look good.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.041
You don't.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.458
Don't take it all.

30:08.291 --> 30:09.750
[gasps]

30:30.125 --> 30:31.541
[cackles]

30:50.333 --> 30:52.708
It feels so good.

31:04.291 --> 31:07.000
Looks like you two are finally
on the same page.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.166
So I'll let you decide.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.125
One of you stays with me.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.291
The other walks free.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.208
-[Rio] Power looks good on you.
-[Billy groans]

31:33.291 --> 31:35.791
[Agatha] Honey,
everything looks good on me.

31:40.958 --> 31:42.291
[Rio] Seems like you're having fun.

31:42.375 --> 31:44.583
[Agatha] Who, me? [cackles]

32:04.500 --> 32:05.583
This is futile.

32:07.291 --> 32:08.291
You know it.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.541
We can't fight Death.

32:15.416 --> 32:16.416
It should be me.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.625
No.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.041
It should be me.

32:27.333 --> 32:28.333
You're not bad.

32:29.916 --> 32:30.958
Neither are you.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.375
You're the only one who thinks so.

32:34.458 --> 32:35.750
[whooshing]

32:46.250 --> 32:47.250
I'll go with you!

32:48.208 --> 32:49.416
That's my choice. Take me.

32:58.583 --> 33:00.291
-Take him.
-What?

33:00.791 --> 33:02.958
You heard him. The boy.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.333
As promised.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.250
-[chuckles]
-It's over.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.291
Now, put my yard back.

33:15.791 --> 33:18.166
Why don't you plant a few azaleas
on your way out?

33:18.250 --> 33:19.791
But...

33:22.166 --> 33:24.000
-I thought you were...
-What can I say?

33:24.583 --> 33:27.625
I'm a coven-less witch. [chuckles]

33:35.791 --> 33:37.625
[Billy] Agatha. Agatha.

33:38.708 --> 33:39.708
Agatha.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.416
I know you can hear me.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.500
Is this how Nicky died?

36:36.916 --> 36:37.916
[Rio] You may go.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.208
[Rebecca] William? William. Oh, my God.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.708
-Are you all right? Where've you been?
-[Jeff] Is he home?

38:33.791 --> 38:35.083
-Yes, he's home!
-[Jeff] William.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.500
-Why are you bleeding?
-I'm fine.

38:36.583 --> 38:38.000
-[Rebecca] Look at your face!
-I'm fine.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.916
You've been gone for 24 hours.
What happened?

39:52.708 --> 39:54.208
[Billy] Take me to the Witches' Road!

39:54.291 --> 39:55.750
The Witches' Road doesn't exist.

39:55.833 --> 39:57.375
-You're lying.
-Am I?

40:13.833 --> 40:15.458
[Billy] It's exactly how I pictured it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
[Agatha] It suits you.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.583
I didn't think you had it in you.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.666
You didn't think who had what in them?

40:35.166 --> 40:36.208
[Lilia] You are the Magician.

40:36.750 --> 40:38.000
You have enormous potential

40:38.666 --> 40:41.541
and the ability to turn
all of your goals into reality.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.250
Wait.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.541
[Jen] Now, this is a house.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.083
[Agatha] Right off your vision board.

40:57.375 --> 41:00.583
Even with the sigil in the way,
you and your mother have the same tell.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.291
-[Billy] Which is?
-Very inconvenient for you.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.791
Wait, wait, wait.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.958
[Agatha] Gosh, you really are a Maximoff.

41:12.041 --> 41:18.250
Otherwise, none of this would be
nearly as dramatic.

41:33.833 --> 41:36.416
You're so much like your mother.

41:44.333 --> 41:45.583
It was me.

41:47.416 --> 41:48.750
[Disembodied Voice cackles]

41:57.916 --> 41:59.291
-[Disembodied Voice] Boo!
-[yelps]
