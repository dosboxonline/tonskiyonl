00:07.842 --> 00:08.884
Little help?

00:08.884 --> 00:10.344
No can do.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.805
The C.I.A. Christmas party
invite is coming any moment.

00:12.805 --> 00:16.100
Clicking "refresh"
over and over won't
make it come any faster.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.643
- What was that, Hayley?

00:17.643 --> 00:20.146
I couldn't hear you
over my inbox dinging.

00:20.146 --> 00:22.690
The party will be held at
Scamper's East.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.024
Yes, baby.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.569
Ugh. That dumpy pub
in Chimdale?

00:26.569 --> 00:28.612
Are you kidding?
Scamper's is amazing.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.949
Classy, too.
The golf course there? Mwah.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.285
Miniature. Two holes.

00:34.285 --> 00:37.204
And one of 'em,
half the AstroTurf is blue.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.749
Blue and green,
'Zooka Sharks colors.

00:39.749 --> 00:40.833
'Zooka Sharks?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.501
Does that guy
live around here?

00:42.501 --> 00:45.463
Well, I'm sure you and Mom
will have a great time.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.839
We'll all have a great time.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.967
I was able to secure invites
for the entire family.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.802
- Even Klaus.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.095
Let's go!

00:53.095 --> 00:55.556
So do we, like, have to go?

00:55.556 --> 00:59.602
Big time. You must understand,
I had a monster year at work.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.437
Special missions?
I crushed 'em.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.397
Boring meetings?
I plussed 'em.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.734
And I went undefeated in
our fantasy football league.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.403
The Christmas party
is my personal victory lap,

01:09.403 --> 01:11.822
and I want my family there
to enjoy me.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.532
That's wonderful.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.577
Now you can close
your computer and decorate
the tree with us.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.079
Better idea. Let's prepare
for my work party.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.916
I'll make flashcards
of my accomplishments
this year.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.042
There were a lot!

01:23.042 --> 01:25.419
- I bet.
- We should also talk outfits.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.713
I recommend something festive,
yet quirky.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.591
Oh, God, Hayley,
you're not thinking of
wearing that to the party?

01:30.591 --> 01:35.304
You mean the party
I just literally heard about
30 seconds ago? No.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.806
Phew!

01:39.683 --> 01:42.269
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:45.898
<i>♪ I got a feeling
That it's gonna be
A wonderful day ♪</i>

01:45.898 --> 01:48.943
<i>♪ The sun in the sky

01:48.943 --> 01:52.696
<i>♪ And he's shining a salute
To the American race ♪</i>

01:55.533 --> 01:58.452
<i>♪ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ♪</i>

01:58.452 --> 02:00.996
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:00.996 --> 02:02.081
Ah!

02:03.666 --> 02:06.877
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:06.877 --> 02:10.130
Look at that marquee.
This is already great.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.423
Get in here, everyone!

02:11.423 --> 02:12.883
When we get inside,

02:12.883 --> 02:15.302
Klaus and I will fill mashed
potato cups for everyone.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.138
Francine, the open bar
lasts 45 minutes,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.807
so order me two Moscow mules.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.892
Hayley, head straight to
<i>Big Buck Hunter.</i>

02:21.892 --> 02:24.144
Don't let anyone touch
the plastic shotgun

02:24.144 --> 02:25.396
until I break the high score.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.981
What about me and Steve?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.691
Great question, Jeffrey.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.151
Play mini golf and listen
for what people are saying
about me.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.196
Report back with the buzz
on the links.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.198
Hot dog buns looking good
this year, Tommy.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.491
Who's Tommy?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.827
He's executive chef/bouncer
here at Scamper's.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.997
Kind of a dual threat.
I actually don't think
that's Tommy.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.957
Interesting.

02:44.957 --> 02:49.378
I've never seen whatever
this is served in a souvenir
batting helmet before.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.338
Whoa, I just
remembered something.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.632
Last year, at this very party,

02:53.632 --> 02:56.510
I carved my name
into one of the toilet seats.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.762
Dang, you think
it's still there?

02:59.972 --> 03:02.141
Fischer takes his time.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.477
He looks pretty high
and he is.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.942
Stop looking back.
It wasn't us.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.032
I see it! "Stan... Smit"?

03:18.032 --> 03:19.867
Some dude started knocking.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.368
I'm gonna finish it now.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.870
Scamper's East blows.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.705
We should leave
for Bullock's party.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.998
Bullock's party?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.875
- Amen. This place
is for riff-raff.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.378
I heard Bullock's party has a
10-foot shrimp scampi tower.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.758
Bullock's throwing a secret
party the same night as
the C.I.A. Christmas party?

03:35.758 --> 03:38.344
Stiles says he's already
at Bullock's house.

03:38.344 --> 03:42.640
Holy cow. He's playing
cornhole with Ghostface Killah
and the Golden Bachelor.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.184
No freaking way!
Did they come together?

03:45.184 --> 03:46.393
Let's go find out.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.145
We can finish peeing
at Bullock's.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.655
Sorry, I drank both
your mules,

03:57.655 --> 03:59.990
but these drinks
are basically water.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.825
Yeah, I said it.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.118
Do something.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.829
Stan heard some
devastating news
in the bathroom.

04:05.829 --> 04:09.083
Thank God the town got rid of
that suicide hotline.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.085
Otherwise he'd be
on it all night.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.920
A Blue Moon for my boy Stan.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.505
Open bar just ended.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.049
That's fine. How much is it?

04:17.049 --> 04:18.759
- Twelve bucks.
- Forget it.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.427
I think I just got tetanus.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.263
A lot of exposed nails
coming through the floor.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.556
What's wrong with Dad?

04:24.556 --> 04:26.392
Turns out there's
a better party at Bullock's,

04:26.392 --> 04:30.062
but Stan only got invited
to the riff-raff party.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.772
<i>♪ Yo, listen up!♪</i>

04:31.772 --> 04:34.733
<i>♪ Here's the story
about a little guy ♪</i>

04:34.733 --> 04:37.319
<i>♪ That lives in a blue world ♪</i>

04:37.319 --> 04:39.279
<i>♪ And all day and all night ♪</i>

04:39.279 --> 04:43.283
<i>♪ And everything he sees
is just blue like him ♪</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:45.703
<i>♪ Inside and outside ♪</i>

04:45.703 --> 04:47.621
I say we crash Bullock's.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.289
Let's go home, Stan.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.374
Home?

04:54.878 --> 04:58.298
I agree, Steve. I thought that
busboy was very handsy.

04:58.298 --> 05:02.177
Now that that's over,
we can finally
decorate the tree.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.180
Stan, where are you going?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.647
I'm going to
Bullock's [bleep] party.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.107
I knew you'd come.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.067
Got this hog all ready for ya.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.822
Out of juice already?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.700
Don't worry, there's actually
another scooter nearby,

05:24.700 --> 05:27.494
but it's in Tuttle's garage.
Also, he owns it.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.496
So we'd be stealing
Tuttle's scooter?

05:29.496 --> 05:32.875
Essentially, or we could
just take your car.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.334
Hmm.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.671
<i>And that's the night
my scooter got stolen.</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:46.847
Bullock runs
a tight ship.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.849
I never get invited anywhere.

05:48.849 --> 05:53.270
Which makes me an expert
at sneaking into events
where I'm not wanted.

05:53.270 --> 05:58.025
I once snuck my Pomona boys
into Adam Driver's
Golden Globes party.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.526
- Okay.
- To be fair,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.862
this was years before
Adam Driver got famous.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.031
Damn it, Klaus,
what's our plan?

06:05.657 --> 06:06.867
I'm Tom Hanks.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.244
I'm Colin Hanks.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.455
I'm Hank Azaria?

06:11.455 --> 06:13.999
For Christ's sake, Smith,
what is your problem?

06:13.999 --> 06:18.087
My problem is you
didn't invite me to your
Christmas party. Why not?

06:18.087 --> 06:20.547
Okay, I'll level with you.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.425
The fire marshal
is a real hard-ass.

06:23.425 --> 06:27.054
He gave me a firm cap
of 500 guests.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.097
Five hundred?

06:28.097 --> 06:29.973
It's ludicrous, I know,

06:29.973 --> 06:33.435
but maybe you'll
make the cut next year.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.898
Hank Azaria, Mr. 500!

06:37.898 --> 06:41.110
Where are you?
I'm literally outside.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.403
I think I have a way in.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.365
Me, "shut up"?
No, you shut up!

06:47.866 --> 06:50.869
Hold on. Some guy with a chin
is saying something. What?

06:50.869 --> 06:54.623
I overheard your conversation
and it sounds like
you need a date.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.583
I happen to be in need
of a wristband.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.378
Perhaps I could be your
plus one for the night.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.130
Fine.
You seem normal enough.

07:01.130 --> 07:05.175
You can be my date
because my husband's
an asshole!

07:09.096 --> 07:11.974
- Sir, for the last time--
- Ka-pow!

07:12.349 --> 07:14.017
Oops. Ka-blam!

07:14.017 --> 07:16.854
Flawless reveal, sir.
Enjoy the party.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.399
I'm Tom Hanks.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.733
Welcome, Mr. Hanks.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.793
It's a winter wonderland.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.420
The shrimp scampi tower.

07:41.420 --> 07:45.757
I can smell
the garlicky butter
cascading from here.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.467
It's beautiful.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.762
Don't skimp on the scamp!

07:50.762 --> 07:52.931
Hey, Stan, meet my new friend,

07:52.931 --> 07:55.976
All-Pro wide receiver
Stefon Diggs.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.187
Jackson told me all about
your fantasy football team.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.772
Then I was like,
"Wait, I was on that team?"

08:00.772 --> 08:03.901
Office champions!
We did it, bro.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.904
I have a spare football
in the car.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.156
Feel like tossing me
a few long bombs?

08:10.073 --> 08:13.202
Nuh-uh. You want to
keep that wristband?

08:13.202 --> 08:16.496
You better not
leave my side all night.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.539
But Stefon Diggs--

08:17.539 --> 08:19.333
But Stefon, nothing.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.961
Order me three shots
of Tito's while I
stretch out my hammies.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.256
We're about to set
that dance floor on fire.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.176
Maybe we should leave.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.886
What are you talking about?
We just got here.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.223
There's something about
your date that gives me
a bad feeling.

08:34.223 --> 08:37.434
We should try to find
some coke ASAP.

08:39.728 --> 08:40.979
We're not going home.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.981
I'm sure everyone is
sound asleep by now anyway.

08:42.981 --> 08:47.778
Dang it! Dad knows
I can't sleep unless I know
everyone's safe in their beds.

08:47.778 --> 08:50.239
- You guys left Scamper's?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.282
I was holding down
<i>Big Buck Hunter,</i>

08:52.282 --> 08:54.868
as instructed,
and all the lights shut off.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.454
What? We didn't
break the golf course.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.667
I love you all so much.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.753
Now, who is ready to rock?

09:06.755 --> 09:10.550
Good, because this band
can really rip.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.053
Ladies and gents, I give you

09:13.053 --> 09:16.139
Kris Kringle
and the Naughty Boys.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.225
Santa?

09:18.225 --> 09:19.726
He's in a band?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.062
I trapped Santa
in the freakin' Jingleverse.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.897
- Guess he got out.
- You think?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.315
Check, check.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.069
He's got those weird
Jeff Bezos muscles!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.404
He'll kill us, Stan.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.863
Ho ho ho!

09:31.863 --> 09:34.157
This first one's
off our new EP.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.786
It's called "Nasty Christmas."

09:40.038 --> 09:42.165
<i>♪ I left your
Christmas presents
underneath the</i> [bleep] <i>tree ♪</i>

09:42.165 --> 09:46.003
<i>♪ A gift card to Sephora
because your face
looks dead to me ♪</i>

09:46.003 --> 09:49.256
Damn, this goes kind of hard.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.425
- I need to use the bathroom.
- No, you don't.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.761
You don't understand.
Santa and I have a history.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.930
Join the club. I'm his wife.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.599
- His what now?
- His wife.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.603
Clarissa Claus?
I married that son of a bitch.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.065
Oh, my God! You're Mrs. Claus?

10:07.065 --> 10:11.194
We're gonna make Santa
real jealous tonight.

10:14.865 --> 10:19.161
Stan, we need to get
some shrimp scampi and
get the [bleep] out of here!

10:23.165 --> 10:24.958
- Smith!

10:25.584 --> 10:27.753
Keep playing, Santa.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.464
My face is only
partially melted.

10:30.464 --> 10:34.009
You promised me you wouldn't
invite Stan Smith!

10:34.009 --> 10:37.721
I assure you,
Smith is not here.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.473
Yeah, he is.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.516
He's my date.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.268
- Wow.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.520
- This is--
- Don't you dare say "awkward."

10:45.520 --> 10:48.190
Awkward!

10:48.190 --> 10:52.652
Why are you doing this,
Clarissa? And with him,
of all people?

10:52.652 --> 10:57.199
Remember when I called you
from the gate because I
didn't want to walk in alone?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.868
I told you we had sound check.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.995
You could have left
for five minutes.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.498
The levels on Nate's
Stratocaster were all--

11:04.498 --> 11:09.211
So typical.
Putting your stupid
bandmates before me.

11:09.211 --> 11:13.423
Stupid? Nate's an
Anthropology major at UMass!

11:13.423 --> 11:15.133
I am so over this.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.511
Why can't you be happy for me?

11:17.511 --> 11:21.598
I've finally found something
that gives me creative
fulfillment.

11:21.598 --> 11:25.268
Because you turned into
jolly old Saint Dick.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.897
Well, I should also be--

11:28.897 --> 11:30.857
You did this, Smith.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.110
You're gonna die tonight.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.746
Smith!

11:46.623 --> 11:47.624
Get in!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.253
I'm keeping the North Pole!

11:51.253 --> 11:53.964
Good luck fitting 1,500 elves

11:53.964 --> 11:56.967
into a studio apartment!

11:56.967 --> 11:59.219
I'm the one
who drafted his team.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.139
He wanted OBJ
in the second round.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.807
I mean, what year is this?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.892
- Stan?

12:05.892 --> 12:08.687
Nope. He ran off with my wife.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.816
She took the reindeer,
so I need to crash here
for a while.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.235
Oh, I'm exhausted.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.904
I'm going to sleep
like a rock tonight.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.073
You! White noise.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.617
Um...

12:34.004 --> 12:35.213
Whoo!

12:35.213 --> 12:37.966
That North Pole snow
hits different, y'all.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.968
Hey, Chief,
you wanna hit the slopes?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.052
I want to sleep.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.555
You know,
it snows year-round here.

12:43.555 --> 12:47.058
But we still have to import
some snow from Colombia.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.227
Solid joke. I've laughed
every time you've said it.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.396
But please,
I can't party anymore.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.106
I know exactly what you need.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.108
A bloody effin' Mary!

12:55.108 --> 12:59.070
Bloody Mary, yes!
Bloody-bloody- bloody-
bloody-bloody-bloody!

12:59.070 --> 13:01.656
Bloody what? Bloody what?
Bloody what? Bloody Mary!

13:01.656 --> 13:05.827
So if you're here, who will
deliver presents on Christmas?

13:05.827 --> 13:09.456
Oh, I delegate that crap to
my right-hand elf, Guffrie.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.252
I work smarter now. I'm not in
my early 200s anymore,

13:14.252 --> 13:18.006
splooging big old wads
of Christmas magic all night.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.090
"Wads"?

13:19.090 --> 13:21.468
I'm taking better care
of myself now.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.262
I started lifting.
You lift, Steve?

13:24.262 --> 13:26.223
- No.
- Oh, man, you've got to.

13:26.223 --> 13:30.560
I'll hook you up with
my amino acid guy.
He'll find you some steroids.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.147
With that frame,
you're gonna get yoked.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.816
Sorry to interrupt
your midlife crisis,

13:36.816 --> 13:39.402
but what the hell is that?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.197
Those would be my dried-up
contact lenses.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.115
I wear dailies now.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.578
When I'm about to fall asleep,
I just flick 'em wherever.
It's liberating.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.331
I'm gonna kill your father.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.208
Dad's still not home?

13:53.208 --> 13:57.420
Damn. You're not worried he's,
you know, up to anything
with Mrs. Claus?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.507
Your dad? Hell, no.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.009
I got that shit
locked down tight.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.347
This should be good.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.016
- Hello?
<i>- Francine, it's me, Klaus.</i>

14:10.016 --> 14:11.476
<i>We're in the North Pole.</i>

14:11.476 --> 14:14.646
Oh, I already know.
Santa told me.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.022
<i>Santa Claus?</i>

14:16.022 --> 14:18.650
He said Stan
ran off with Mrs. Claus.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.777
<i>That's not how
it went down, Franny.</i>

14:20.777 --> 14:24.197
<i>She dragged us up here,
and she won't stop serving
Bloody Marys.</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:25.240
<i>It's a nightmare!</i>

14:25.240 --> 14:28.243
Right, that sounds terrible.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.245
For your guys' information,

14:30.245 --> 14:33.456
I'm letting Santa stay here
till you get back.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.167
Watch this. Oh, and, Klaus?

14:36.167 --> 14:39.254
Mention that Santa
sleeps without a shirt on.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.881
Oh, those muscles.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.886
Doesn't Santa
look good, Hayley?

14:46.886 --> 14:51.099
Oh, yeah,
I'd take a bumpy ride
on his Polar Express,

14:51.099 --> 14:52.767
if you know what I mean?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.227
<i>I do.</i>

14:56.646 --> 14:59.524
Bloody-bloody-bloody.
Sip the Bloody.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.860
- Sip it!

15:01.860 --> 15:05.071
- The weed cookies
are done baking.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.575
First, you bake them,
then they bake you.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.537
Again, for the fourth time,
that joke is hilarious.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.459
Stan, I talked to Francine.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.295
She's pissed you ditched them
for Bullock's party.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.214
And get this. She's letting
Santa sleep there

15:23.214 --> 15:24.299
In our house?

15:24.299 --> 15:25.884
You haven't heard
the worst of it.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.219
Santa sleeps bare-chested.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.097
He's got the whole family
all horned up.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.267
Come on. We're getting
the hell out of here.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.102
What are you doing
with the decorations?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.021
They're going back
to the basement.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.191
Your father ruined Christmas
this year, so there's no point
in decorating.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.026
But I love Christmas.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.278
It makes me sad and happy.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.780
Oh, now, wait a minute.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.784
Stan may be a Grade A jackass,
but it's still Christmas.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.828
Why do you care?
You're a godless musician now.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.875
Duck, Mom!
He's about to splooge wads!

16:07.425 --> 16:09.969
It's good old-fashioned
Christmas magic.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.471
Splooge more!

16:11.471 --> 16:13.890
It does look festive.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.437
It's snowing, bitches.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.950
That was very fun.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.827
Stan! Where'd you go?

16:33.827 --> 16:37.747
I made us peanut brittle,
but with ketamine
instead of peanuts.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.339
What's the deal
with these reindeer?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.592
"Chuck"? "Leon"?
Where's Rudolph?

16:49.592 --> 16:51.928
These guys don't seem
like Santa's A-squad.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.432
Listen, Rudolph.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.184
One smells like a man,
the other smells like a fish.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.352
Go!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.982
- I don't know what to do.
- Jiggle them or something.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.528
Oh, no, you don't.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.365
She sees us, Stan. Go faster.
Jiggle them harder!

17:12.365 --> 17:14.033
Mrs. Claus is gaining on us.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.827
Wow! She's got wheels, Stan!

17:15.827 --> 17:19.038
A lightning-quick first step
and amazing top-end speed.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.123
Nothing is working.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.167
She's now outpacing
the dogs, Stan!

17:22.167 --> 17:24.502
Her gait is equal parts
grace and power.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.381
She has long,
galloping strides,
like Seattle Slew!

17:28.381 --> 17:31.217
On Leon, on Hank,
on Rhonda and Frank!

17:38.683 --> 17:41.478
You can just talk to 'em,
Klaus. They're magic.

17:45.148 --> 17:49.569
I can't believe
I'm saying this,
but I like being here.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.697
Me, too.
It's like a new chapter
in our relationship.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.866
Can I ask you girls something?

17:54.866 --> 17:55.950
Shoot, Big Red.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.037
Why do women hate music?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.040
You'll need to be
a little more specific.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.583
I mean, Mrs. Claus.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.879
Ever since I formed my band,
she started acting all crazy.

18:07.879 --> 18:12.175
She's always whining
that I don't spend time
with her anymore.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.301
Well, do you?

18:13.301 --> 18:14.385
Of course.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.137
I mean, not all the time.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.430
I'm Santa Claus.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.807
I'm a busy guy.

18:18.807 --> 18:22.143
I have to make my list,
check it twice.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.478
What about after work?

18:23.478 --> 18:25.188
I usually hit the gym,

18:25.188 --> 18:29.150
then band practice until 3:00,
maybe 4:00, in the morning.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.110
Then I wake up
and do it all over again.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.695
Come on, Santa.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.781
You've gotta put in
a little more effort.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.326
Yeah, dude.
Mrs. Claus is lonely,
not crazy.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.248
If you don't stop,
we'll crash!

18:43.248 --> 18:45.542
I don't care.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.504
I'd rather die than spend
another Christmas alone!

18:54.008 --> 18:55.635
I have an idea.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.596
You could include Mrs. Claus
more in your life.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.807
Maybe she could
run your social media.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.975
That could work!

19:01.975 --> 19:04.352
She's actually quite active
on Facebook.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.522
Loves inspirational quotes,
hates vaccines,

19:07.522 --> 19:10.191
loves memes
about hating vaccines.

19:16.781 --> 19:20.118
Leave my family alone,
you roided-out bastard!

19:20.118 --> 19:21.244
It's okay, Dad.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.662
We're cool with Santa now.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.038
We started a new chapter.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.792
- We did?
- It's water under
the bridge, Smith.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.587
I need to apologize
to you guys.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.006
I never should have ditched
you for Bullock's party.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.382
Clearly.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.968
I was so busy looking for love
from everyone else,

19:36.968 --> 19:40.847
I forgot that all the love
I need is right here.
With you.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.393
Okay, Stan,
that sounds from the heart.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.811
And we forgive you.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.438
I'm okay.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.899
But I don't think
I learned any lessons.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.360
My baby!

19:57.363 --> 19:59.824
- Kris?
- Sweet Clarissa.

19:59.824 --> 20:03.161
I was so busy looking for love
from everyone else,

20:03.161 --> 20:06.414
I forgot that all the love I
need is right here.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.624
With you.

20:07.624 --> 20:10.251
Santa straight-up
stole Stan's lesson.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.795
I decided to cancel
the band's tour.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.381
I want to spend
more time with you.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.966
Oh, Santa.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.012
I'm really sorry
I slept with Stan.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.513
You did what?

20:22.513 --> 20:23.765
You seem jealous.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.059
Are you jealous?
Tell me you're jealous.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.310
Smith!

20:27.310 --> 20:28.394
I didn't touch her.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.232
What is with this weather?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.069
When I got dressed up
to [bleep] last night,
it was a low 50s.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.820
Now I look ridiculous.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.156
I thought we started
a new chapter.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.699
That chapter is over!

20:41.699 --> 20:44.452
In this one, you die!

20:52.585 --> 20:55.296
The American Dad.
What a silly goose.
