Oh, don't even.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.529
Jesus, Maddie, stop.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.531
They do a lot more than makeup.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.932
Maddie, please. Don't.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.101
It's the truth.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.457
Mr. Wisdom, take this one.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.825
Prisoner, mind your step.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.026
Step.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.330
Easy, Doc.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.831
Remove the hood.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.333
Copy that.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.806
You sure know how
to treat a lady.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.842
Doc, if you're a lady,

02:55.243 --> 02:56.310
I'm a kangaroo.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.479
Shut up, both of you.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.582
You don't talk to this
prisoner, Mr. Galotti.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.386
She's just meat we're movin'
from A to goddamn B.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.588
Yes sir, Mr. Stauffer.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.856
Prisoner secure.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.395
Prisoner secure.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.570
Alone at last?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.204
Don't, Doc.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.073
They catch me being nice to you,
they'll kick my ass.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.417
Take your seat, Mr. Galotti.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.752
Yes, sir, Mr. Wisdom.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.754
Mr. Wisdom.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.624
How'd you get a name like that
when you're such a dumbass?

03:46.126 --> 03:49.029
Next time, it'll be your face,
Ms. Brown.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.864

04:20.894 --> 04:21.695
B team ready?

04:23.196 --> 04:23.897
All right.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.674
I am proud as fuck of
each and every one of you.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.010
Stuck together by my side when
the world told you not to.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.080
If that ain't love, what is?

04:41.782 --> 04:44.452
Tell B team we are a go!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.264
You got your
learner's on you?

04:57.365 --> 04:59.667
Always. Passed my written
the first time.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.234
How many times did it take you?

05:01.635 --> 05:02.770
What are you doing?

05:02.870 --> 05:03.871
We're gonna be late
for the movies.

05:03.971 --> 05:04.938
Not if you drive.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.042
Really?
I can drive your truck?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.511
I don't know, can you?

05:10.611 --> 05:11.612
Fuck, yeah.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.671
Don't I always tell you
to go potty

05:37.771 --> 05:39.740
before we hit the road,
Mr. Wisdom?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.841
What'd you say to me?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.175
Your leg.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.977
It's pumping like you had
ten cups of coffee.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.012
Shut up.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.683
Oh, Galotti.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.555
Seatbelt up.

05:56.657 --> 05:57.658
Now, fix your mirrors.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.759
Make sure no one's coming.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.694
I know, I know.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.863
Okay. Take it easy,
you got this.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.197
Okay.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.671
Foxtrot,
back on MC reporting.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.573
ETA on target. Copy.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.007
B team standing by.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.082
Did Mom make you take me
so she could ask some guy over?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.216
What?

06:23.316 --> 06:24.618
Ew, no.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.554
Just wanted to spend
a little time with you

06:26.654 --> 06:28.221
after I got back.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.357
she brought over a guy.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.592
-  Oh, Maddie, please.
- I could hear everything.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.860
Please, stop.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.028
It's Madeleine, by the way.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.798
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.433
Nobody's called me Maddie
in years.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.669
Yeah. I really don't wanna
call you Madeleine.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.803
But I will.
- Okay.

06:42.903 --> 06:43.704
- Because I love you.
- See?

06:45.305 --> 06:46.974
Douchebag! Come on.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.308
He just sped past us.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.610
Look at you.
You really are an adult.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.111
But you're not gonna
find a boyfriend

06:51.211 --> 06:52.145
with that language.
-  Right,

06:52.245 --> 06:53.380
'cause you don't know like

06:53.481 --> 06:54.782
20 versions
of that word or worse.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.249
Probably closer to 50.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.452
Exactly!
Come on, what are they?

06:58.552 --> 06:59.920
Just keep your eyes
on the road, Maddie.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.622
Madeleine.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.657
- Madeleine. Yes.
-  Yes, yes. Okay.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.992
So, here's what I know...

07:05.092 --> 07:06.226
douche king,

07:06.326 --> 07:08.562
douchemeister, double douche.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.598
There's also douchewad.
-  That's a classic.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.665
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Okay. but these are all still

07:11.765 --> 07:13.266
pretty much entry-level
douches.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.602
Okay, and?

07:14.702 --> 07:15.869
Expand your vocabulary.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.805
So, you have douche wipe.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.406
-  Mm-hmm.
-  You have doucher.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.674
-  Yes.
-  Douche-knuckle.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.476
As in knucklehead and douche.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.111
The douchenator,
Dumble-douche.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.746
Steve Douchemy.
It's weird.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.080
But it does work.
-  Yes. That is weird.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.282
But would it be
douche-cano like a volcano

07:29.382 --> 07:30.618
or douche canoe like a boat?

07:30.718 --> 07:32.385
Douche-cano,

07:32.553 --> 07:35.856
for the fluid that explodes
out of them like a douche.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.424
That's so gross.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.863
Hey, slow down.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.230
A stand still

08:17.330 --> 08:18.732
It's just a little roadwork.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.134
We miss previews,
it's no big deal.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.670
"Coming soon"
is the best part.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.908
That's cheating, isn't it?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.509
If we could, we would.

08:32.012 --> 08:32.813
- Asshole!

You can't get by me

08:35.482 --> 08:37.050
I gotta get through here.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.525
for this shit. You better
shut up and back up, a'ight?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.696
What gives, Mr. Stauffer?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.831
This way into town
was supposed to be clear.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.367
Typical bullshit,
Mr. Wisdom.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.171
Yo. What's the dealio?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.873
Don't worry, Doc.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.298
Maddie, stop. Stop.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.370
Sorry. I was looking down
the road to see what's what.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.305
It's okay, but sometimes
it's better

09:32.405 --> 09:34.708
to just keep your
eyes dead ahead.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.878
Got it. Thanks.

09:38.078 --> 09:38.846
- You're welcome.
- For not yelling.

09:40.881 --> 09:41.849
Of course.

Eric?

14:20.327 --> 14:21.128
You, too.
Get back in the car.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.896
This is not a fucking drill.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.333
Get down! Don't fucking move!

14:26.433 --> 14:27.867
Lock it down!

14:29.970 --> 14:33.306
Get down! This is
not a fucking drill!

14:45.518 --> 14:46.419
Eric?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.789
Snap out of it!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.724
Eric?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.318
Hands on the wheels!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.652
Get back in the car. Now!

15:19.752 --> 15:20.887
Where do you
think you're going?

15:20.988 --> 15:22.322
Kilo, my man!

15:22.422 --> 15:23.456
Why don't you fill us in.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.458
We got a black SUV.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.960
That's probably a cop.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.728
And the prison van...

15:32.432 --> 15:34.467
right where we want it.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.269
Move.
Get back in the car.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.070
Don't fucking move!

15:37.170 --> 15:38.771
Shit.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.440
Exit the truck,
you fucking pig!

15:40.540 --> 15:41.641
We will
torch you fuckers!

15:41.741 --> 15:42.609
No, no, no. No, don't!

15:42.709 --> 15:43.576
Get out of there.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.616
Come on, fucker!

15:49.716 --> 15:50.783
-  Fuck.
-  Oh my-- What?

15:50.883 --> 15:52.285
Burn, baby, burn.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.260
You're next, motherfucker.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.503
Holy shit!
Die, you fucking pig!

16:14.907 --> 16:16.376
Come on, let's go.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.610
Got the keys.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.113
Galotti, extinguisher!

16:20.213 --> 16:21.814
Yeah.

16:22.049 --> 16:22.982
Here.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.819
Wisdom...

16:26.919 --> 16:28.088
Oh my God.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.190
Eric.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.991
We're okay, we're okay.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.827
It's okay.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.496
<i>Attention!</i>

16:36.596 --> 16:39.366
<i>You are now hostages.</i>

16:39.466 --> 16:42.869
<i>Stay in your vehicle
until this is over.</i>

16:42.969 --> 16:46.806
<i>Anyone standing outside by
the time I finish talking</i>

16:46.906 --> 16:48.575
<i>will be shot.</i>

16:48.675 --> 16:50.410
<i>Don't try to be a hero.</i>

16:50.677 --> 16:54.214
<i>At 185 feet above water,
a jump will kill you.</i>

16:54.314 --> 16:57.050
<i>At 2,000 feet per second,</i>

16:57.150 --> 16:58.651
<i>so will our bullets.</i>

17:00.087 --> 17:02.021
<i>Remain in your vehicles.</i>

17:02.122 --> 17:04.724
<i>We will be by to
collect your phones.</i>

17:05.092 --> 17:06.559
Have them ready.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.339
Stay in your car!

17:19.439 --> 17:20.740
-  Kill the engine!
-  Hands on the wheel!

17:20.840 --> 17:21.674
Let's tie these
fuckers down, come on!

17:21.774 --> 17:22.942
All right!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.411
Hostage situation
on the Tobin Bridge.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.945
He's got a radio!
He's a fucking cop!

17:26.045 --> 17:27.347
-  Get his ass out!
-  Open the door!

17:27.447 --> 17:28.448
Get his ass out!

17:28.548 --> 17:29.582
Open up
the fucking car!

17:29.682 --> 17:30.750
Get him! Get him!

17:30.850 --> 17:32.219
Get his ass out
the car right now!

17:32.319 --> 17:33.420
Send all units now!

17:33.520 --> 17:34.521
Get fucked, bitch!

17:34.721 --> 17:35.588
Oh shit!

17:35.688 --> 17:36.856
What the fuck?

17:38.991 --> 17:40.260
Holy shit!

17:40.360 --> 17:41.261
Hole in one.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.295
Whoa!

17:42.395 --> 17:44.264
See? Fuckin' head shot!

17:44.364 --> 17:45.698
Told you these bulletproof
masks save your ass!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.267
You saved my face,
not my ass.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.801
Oh, your face, your ass,
same thing. Get him!

17:48.901 --> 17:49.802
Hey! Open up the door!

17:49.902 --> 17:51.104
Get out!
-  Calm down.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.440
Get out!
Get out to the back!

17:53.540 --> 17:54.907
Open up the back door!

17:55.007 --> 17:56.443
Get the fuck in!

17:56.543 --> 17:57.710
Give me your hands!

17:57.910 --> 17:59.279
Come on!

18:00.880 --> 18:01.981
<i>We have a code silver,</i>

18:02.249 --> 18:03.082

18:16.429 --> 18:18.665
Get down!
Hands on the wheels.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.932
-  No, no.
- Give me the fucking phone!

18:22.169 --> 18:24.337
What do you want?
I ain't doing shit.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.072
Do what we tell
you and you won't get hurt.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.340
Off the cell phone!

18:27.440 --> 18:28.308
Now!
-  Give me that!

18:28.408 --> 18:29.976
Please don't hurt me.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.778
I'll take that
fucking watch too, that's nice.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.079
Hands where we can see 'em.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.918
We're gonna take
your cell phones!

18:39.018 --> 18:40.086
We're not playing around.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.654
Hands on the wheels. Now!

18:41.754 --> 18:43.156
You hippie ass Jesus freak.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.291
Kiss your momma
with that finger?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.658
Don't move!

18:45.758 --> 18:47.327
What are
they doing with those?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.661
Covering their asses.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.962
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.366
Stop the shaking.
I just need to tie you up.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.567
Show me your hands, Gramps.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.771
Over here.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.508
No hero shit.
Don't move, buddy.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.109
Get your hands
on the wheel, Karen.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.178
Get ready to
give them our phones.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.479
- I'm gonna hide mine.
- No.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.547
No way.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.015
- Please.
- It's not a discussion.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.153
Hands, hands, hands.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.388
Show me your hands

19:15.488 --> 19:16.456
or I'll cut them off.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.057
<i>Hey, is everything all right?</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:19.692
Ma, do me a favor. Sit down.

19:19.792 --> 19:20.893
<i>Eric, what's happening?</i>

19:20.993 --> 19:22.061
Show me
your fucking hands.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.062
There's a, uh, situation.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.197
What are you doing?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.898
Roll it down.
- Uh--

19:25.998 --> 19:27.600
she needs to turn on the truck
to roll down the window.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.568
-  <i>Eric!? Eric!?</i>
-  This is not a drill.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.802
Ma, listen to me.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.137
Ma, I promise,
whatever you hear,

19:31.238 --> 19:32.705
I'm gonna bring her home safe--

19:32.805 --> 19:34.140
Hey!

19:34.241 --> 19:35.808
Phones! NOW!

19:42.649 --> 19:43.816
That's one.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.987
Where's yours?

19:50.089 --> 19:51.358
Oh, come on, sweetheart.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.225
You're not gonna make
me take you outside

19:52.325 --> 19:53.593
and pat you down, huh?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.627
Where's the phone, sweetheart?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.369
He's teaching me to drive.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.636
Made me leave it at home.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.072
Oh, that's nice.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.575
Focus on the road, very mature,
very responsible, big bro.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.742
I like that.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.411
It's good. It's really good.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.415
But you know what?
It would be a shame

20:17.484 --> 20:18.918
to find out that you
were lying to me.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.753
We got a little
here then, sweetheart.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.121
There it is.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.591
I just-- I just don't
want that to happen.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.659
You know? I'd hate that.

20:28.127 --> 20:28.961
You hear that, big bro?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.229
Yes.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.664
I made her leave it at home.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.740
Okay.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.209
Leave it at home. I get that.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.210
Makes sense.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.244
Hands.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.549
You too, big bro.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.583
Hands.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.625
Okay.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.892
Catch you guys later.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.902
There was nothing I could do.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.438
He would have killed us.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.943
Turn the fuck around!

21:18.845 --> 21:20.079
-  Stay still.
-  All right, stay calm.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.448
Don't let him go, asshole.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.483
Turn around.
Lock it down, Yankee.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.117
You want one in
the fucking head?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.292
You know what?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.529
I lied.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.098
There's something I can do,
but it's gonna gross you out.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.502
Eric?

21:42.735 --> 21:43.736
What?

21:53.646 --> 21:55.515
I dislocated it
on patrol.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.684
Now I can pop it out
whenever I want.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.751
It just hurts like hell.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.499
What are you doing?

22:12.599 --> 22:13.966
Stay right here.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.769
Be quiet.
I promise I'll be back.

22:25.812 --> 22:26.979
I know, this sucks, right?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.348
Wrong night
for a date night, buddy.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.883
Hey, you. Dude, how many times

22:30.983 --> 22:32.184
do I have to fucking say it?

22:32.419 --> 22:33.720
Roll it down.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.724
Shit!

22:37.824 --> 22:39.392
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.993
What the fuck?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.389
Come on. Come on.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.837
Fuckin'--
fuckin' contractor.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.450
Shit.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.085
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck?

23:39.351 --> 23:40.453
Still got your phone?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.955
- Yeah.
-  If anyone asks,

23:43.055 --> 23:44.457
he threw it over the side.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.659
They're strapping
hands to the wheels.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.694
Fake it if you need to.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.828
What are you even doing, man?

23:48.928 --> 23:49.629
You're gonna get people killed.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.830
Fuck off.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.064
Okay, man?

23:52.499 --> 23:53.700
Fuck off.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.977
Galotti,
Wisdom looks dead.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.079
You got to get me out of here.

24:07.179 --> 24:07.980
Galotti?

24:08.080 --> 24:08.915
Your gun!

24:11.117 --> 24:12.619
Look, if these pricks
are here for me...

24:12.719 --> 24:14.954
They're absolutely
here for you.

24:16.523 --> 24:20.660
I'm so sorry.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.964
Fuck me.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.001
It was you.

24:29.101 --> 24:34.040
Doc, I like you.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.908
From the minute
they brought you into isolation,

24:36.108 --> 24:39.211
it really hurt knowing...

24:39.311 --> 24:41.280
you weren't gonna live
to testify.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.950
Yeah?

24:44.150 --> 24:47.319
Whatever they paid you,
you'll never spend it.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.856
You'll see.

24:49.956 --> 24:50.923
I'm sorry.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.930
Okay, gentlemen.

24:58.130 --> 24:59.298
Delivered as promised.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.967
Yeah, I got eyes, buddy.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.335
What's up, Doc?

25:03.435 --> 25:04.537
Mikey.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.038
Come to break me out?

25:06.138 --> 25:08.340
Nah, something like that.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.176
Boss still needs closure,
you know.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.079
Closure comes in all forms.

25:13.179 --> 25:13.980
Less than six months,

25:15.615 --> 25:16.983
Turns out they don't like it

25:17.083 --> 25:18.718
when you go killin'
other inmates.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.387
Right.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.488
You.

25:22.789 --> 25:23.756
Boss wants to see you,

25:23.856 --> 25:26.726
but first,
I want that rifle.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.961
Galotti, you give that up,
you're as good as dead.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.767
Aw, come on, Doc.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.503
Our friend here has got
nothing to fear from us.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.171
He's not the one
who betrayed us.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.542
What about her?

25:45.377 --> 25:46.779
She ain't going anywhere.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.547
Secure the rest of the hostages.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.553
Doc, huh?

26:03.495 --> 26:06.432
It's quite the operation
you guys got here.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.742
Rest in peace, asshole.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.411
Romeo!

26:22.649 --> 26:23.983
Hey, man.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.052
So, I uh-- do good or what?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.456
Mr. Galotti,
you done real good.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.494
There's one more thing
I could use from you.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.029
Yeah?

26:37.229 --> 26:38.798
Yeah, name it. Anything.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.801
Good.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.939
Dammit!

26:50.076 --> 26:52.044
We can't leave
any toys laying around, Doc.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.347
You might hurt yourself.

27:13.532 --> 27:17.904
All units, check in and confirm
completion of phase two.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.505
<i>
Echo and India, all set.</i>

27:21.040 --> 27:22.141
<i>
Sierra's good to go.</i>

27:25.712 --> 27:26.913
Did you just kill that guy?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.848
Foxtrot

27:32.852 --> 27:33.953
<i>
Yankee confirmed.</i>

27:34.220 --> 27:36.288
<i>
Golf in position.</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:38.024
If they come looking for him,

27:38.124 --> 27:39.692
you have to act like
I was never here.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.060
Keep your hands on the wheel

27:41.160 --> 27:42.494
and pretend like
you're still cuffed.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.796
But that guy knew.
Won't they?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.164
They're not gonna
pay attention to you

27:45.264 --> 27:46.198
unless you give them
a reason to.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.734
What are you gonna do?

27:47.834 --> 27:50.703
Tango, check in and confirm
completion of phase two.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.674
Tango's all set.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.411
All right, everyone,
stay alert.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.880
I'm gonna find you
a way off this bridge.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.081
<i>
Control the bridge.</i>

28:02.181 --> 28:03.482
<i>Keep the peace.</i>

28:13.359 --> 28:14.761
What do we got?

28:14.861 --> 28:16.495
We got a police chopper
on scene, another inbound.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.364
Local news hounds are buzzing
the south side.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.499
Copy that.
And on the ground?

28:20.599 --> 28:23.169
Blockade on the north,
they're staying way back.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.872
South side,
cops are 50 yards from the gap.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.907
Tango. I don't like Tango
taking so long.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.508
That kid's a liability.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.512
I'm sorry, what gives you
the right to say so?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.249
Oh.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.818
That's my point exactly.

28:41.821 --> 28:46.192
Look, man, all I'm saying is,
every minute we waste

28:46.292 --> 28:48.360
gives the cops another
to pull something. All right?

28:48.460 --> 28:50.229
They got choppers
all over us already.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.001
I say it's about time
we back them off.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.710
Hey, lock down
that parameter right now.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.712
I need a general [indistinct].

29:09.348 --> 29:10.282
<i>
Nine-one-one,</i>

29:10.382 --> 29:11.583
<i>what's your emergency?</i>

29:11.683 --> 29:13.485
I blew two holes
in the Tobin Bridge

29:13.585 --> 29:15.254
exactly 11 minutes ago.

29:15.354 --> 29:19.025
You know this because you have
news choppers flying overhead.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.126
<i>
Passing you through to</i>

29:20.226 --> 29:20.960
<i>the senior officer on scene.</i>

29:21.060 --> 29:22.761
<i>Stand by.</i>

29:24.864 --> 29:26.098
This is Police Inspector

29:26.198 --> 29:28.100
Terry Grimes,
senior officer in charge.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.135
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

29:29.235 --> 29:31.103
Hi, Terry.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.404
Are you watching the news?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.073
Yes, sir, I am.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.942
Look, we wanna
resolve this situation

29:36.042 --> 29:36.976
without any further
loss of life,

29:37.076 --> 29:38.177
so I just need you to...

29:38.277 --> 29:39.411
I have news choppers

29:39.511 --> 29:41.447
flying far too close
to my bridge.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.185
Yeah, I see that.
I'm gonna back them off.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.786
Well, don't you worry.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.156
I'm gonna do that for you
right now.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.423
Please hold.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.764
Here we go.

29:58.865 --> 29:59.966
Golf. Cover me.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.200
Copy.

30:03.870 --> 30:04.636
Position set.

30:21.921 --> 30:22.821
<i>
Mayday! Mayday!</i>

30:22.922 --> 30:24.123
Oh, boy.

30:55.922 --> 30:57.689
Did you see that, Terry?

30:57.789 --> 30:59.858
Listen, we are not
some bush-league jihadis.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.327
We are an elite force,

31:01.427 --> 31:02.594
ready for anything
you could ever throw at us.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.495
Wait, wait, wait.
You got to give me--

31:03.595 --> 31:05.497
No, no, Terry. I don't.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.533
I want you cops out of my hair,

31:07.766 --> 31:09.902
and I want the news
reporting from a distance.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.238
All right? Matter of fact,
you tell everyone to get back,

31:12.338 --> 31:13.439
because the next time,

31:13.539 --> 31:14.506
we'll do more than
hit your bird.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.507
You got me?

31:17.343 --> 31:18.877
Give me a status report
on that chopper.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.080
Look out.

31:22.982 --> 31:23.749
You ready?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.153
Let's go to work.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.364
<i>Good evening, America.</i>

31:38.464 --> 31:41.667
<i>We are coming to you
live from the Tobin Bridge.</i>

31:42.001 --> 31:44.670
<i>Your live news outlet of choice

31:58.384 --> 32:00.719
<i>For now,
I offer you a taste</i>

32:00.819 --> 32:04.356
<i>of what you can expect tonight
should anybody interfere.</i>

32:09.428 --> 32:10.362
This is Inspector Grimes.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.768
Oh my--

32:28.014 --> 32:31.283
Pentagon used the testimony
of a traitor,

32:31.617 --> 32:34.153
<i>Samantha "Doc" Brown,
a disgraced Army veteran</i>

32:34.420 --> 32:37.956
<i>who falsely testified
that Retcon Squad One Three</i>

32:38.057 --> 32:41.393
<i>massacred innocent civilians
without sanction.</i>

32:47.633 --> 32:48.334
India reporting.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.268
All clear.

33:12.891 --> 33:16.995
<i>Meet Doc.
She lied to save herself</i>

33:17.263 --> 33:18.730
<i>and discredit
the private soldiers</i>

33:18.830 --> 33:20.732
<i>that fought bravely by
her side.</i>

33:20.832 --> 33:23.402
<i>Blood of everyone
who dies tonight</i>

33:23.502 --> 33:25.037
will be on her hands.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.838
<i>[on stream] Terror
over here and terror there.</i>

33:26.938 --> 33:29.041
<i>You're guilty.</i>

33:30.676 --> 33:33.179
Come on, Maddie.

33:33.279 --> 33:36.348
<i>The Pentagon will release
the Shattered Dove files</i>

33:36.448 --> 33:37.216
<i>on the front page
of their website</i>

33:37.316 --> 33:39.485
<i>by 2100 hours Eastern.</i>

33:39.585 --> 33:43.021
<i>They will release the Retcon
soldiers held in an unnamed</i>

33:43.122 --> 33:46.192
<i>black site that they claim
does not exist.</i>

33:47.093 --> 33:50.729
<i>My comrades are heroes,
not war criminals.</i>

33:50.829 --> 33:52.331
Come on, come on.

33:52.431 --> 33:53.899
<i>[on camera] Once
I receive verbal confirmation</i>

33:53.999 --> 33:55.601
<i>that they are free,
we will withdraw.</i>

33:55.701 --> 33:59.671
<i>There will be no more
phone calls, no negotiations.</i>

34:00.005 --> 34:02.441
<i>You fail to meet our demand,
put snipers on us,</i>

34:02.541 --> 34:04.042
<i>call in a SWAT team,</i>

34:04.310 --> 34:07.045
<i>you'll be fishing bodies
out of the river for weeks.</i>

34:07.313 --> 34:09.415
<i>Do not test us.</i>

34:09.515 --> 34:11.083
<i>Nine PM.</i>

34:20.359 --> 34:21.427
Hello?

34:21.527 --> 34:22.628
Hey, you little shit.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.530
Eric.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.897
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

34:25.997 --> 34:27.899
You're lit up like
a beacon over there.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.235
<i>Put your phone on speaker</i>

34:29.335 --> 34:30.936
and turn it face down
in your lap.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.076
Where are you?

34:38.177 --> 34:40.446
I'm not far.

34:40.546 --> 34:41.513
<i>I can see you.</i>

34:47.986 --> 34:51.123
They killed a guy on camera.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.258
You saw that?

34:52.358 --> 34:53.259
<i>It's trending.</i>

34:53.359 --> 34:55.227
The whole thing is trending.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.728
<i>They're on the prison bus now.</i>

35:19.751 --> 35:20.852
Come on.

35:20.952 --> 35:21.853
Come on, come on.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.626
Is that you, Terry?

35:27.859 --> 35:29.094
Hey, look, you made
your point, okay?

35:29.195 --> 35:31.397
Oh, I've just started
making my point.

35:31.597 --> 35:34.333
Look, this Doc Brown is who
your grudge is with, right?

35:34.433 --> 35:35.967
So, what do you say
you let everyone go

35:36.067 --> 35:37.203
and you hang onto her

35:37.303 --> 35:38.704
until we're able to work
this thing out?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.173
Trading the life of one
for the lives of many.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.974
That is very "Wrath of Khan,"
Terry,

35:43.209 --> 35:45.143
except I don't think
Doc will see it that way,

35:45.244 --> 35:47.546
and quite frankly,
I don't either.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.581
The clock is ticking.
Hustle up.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.651
We're over ten mil
and climbing.

35:53.785 --> 35:54.653
Let me see that.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.726
Come a quarter way up.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.196
Give me everything you've got
on a Samantha "Doc" Brown.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.364
Is there anything about

36:05.464 --> 36:07.733
a high-profile prisoner?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.134
Someone rich?

36:09.235 --> 36:10.469
Someone famous?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.371
There was a woman
they called a traitor?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.605
Traitor?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.375
Okay. Don't hang up.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.143
I'll be right back.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.212
Hey, kid.
Band are comin'.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.050
Eric?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.055
You're a Marine, kid?

36:30.456 --> 36:33.725
Army Ranger. Was.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.160
You fought?

36:35.261 --> 36:36.762
Back in the Stone Age.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.829
'Nam.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.169
I count five, maybe two or
three more in the op-center.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.171
Sniper on its roof,

36:46.272 --> 36:49.007
but he's got cops
to worry about.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.642
This'll get me past him.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.643
Copy that.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.047
Thank you, sir.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.783
Joe Kozak.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.251
Not "sir."

37:01.887 --> 37:03.188
Once a grunt--

37:03.289 --> 37:04.222
Always a grunt.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.328
You're clear
behind that black van.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.184
<i>
Breaking news.</i>

37:33.519 --> 37:35.120
<i>Terror on the Tobin continues.</i>

37:35.220 --> 37:38.089
<i>Captain James Roken and members
of his Retcon 13 squad</i>

37:38.189 --> 37:39.458
<i>recently escaped detention</i>

37:39.558 --> 37:41.660
<i>after facing charges
for war crimes.</i>

37:41.927 --> 37:43.829
<i>The resulting manhunt
ended abruptly tonight</i>

37:43.929 --> 37:46.298
<i>when Roken seized
the Tobin Bridge by force,</i>

37:46.398 --> 37:48.900
<i>taking over 70 hostages
above the Mystic River</i>

37:49.000 --> 37:51.036
<i>with no way for the police
to rescue them.</i>

37:51.370 --> 37:53.238
<i>City and federal officials
are meeting Homeland Security</i>

37:53.339 --> 37:54.906
<i>to assess the situation,</i>

37:55.173 --> 37:57.476
<i>but the terrorists' superior
firepower means it's unlikely</i>

37:57.743 --> 38:00.479
<i>police can make any assault
while Roken holds the bridge.</i>

38:09.020 --> 38:12.691
This thing
is hot and heavy.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.292
Just like your mom, Tango.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.727
You wanna tango?
Let's dance!

38:40.151 --> 38:42.120
Who the fuck are you?

38:42.220 --> 38:43.288
I'm just a guy
wondering why

38:43.389 --> 38:45.156
these homegrown
terrorist assholes

38:45.256 --> 38:46.458
think something on this bridge

38:46.558 --> 38:49.160
is worth dragging
all this aggro for.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.897
Go back to your car, kid,
before you wind up dead.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.164
First off...

38:55.066 --> 38:57.068
you don't know me.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.704
So try not to meet
the wrong version.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.506
Second...

39:00.606 --> 39:03.475
I didn't get this by playing
fucking rock, paper, scissors.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.310
Good for you.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.145
But that guy was a lightweight

39:07.245 --> 39:08.747
compared to the rest
of these snake eaters.

39:08.847 --> 39:09.981
Special Forces, yeah?

39:11.249 --> 39:13.184
Dead guy had a Retcon tattoo.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.921
Yeah. Private
military contractors.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.322
Loudspeaker? Big voice?

39:17.423 --> 39:18.724
That's none other
than Jimmy Roken.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.530
Jimmy Roken, huh?
Captain Chaos.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.098
Youngest non-com to be
made Captain since Vietnam.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.000
Killer extraordinaire.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.002
You're looking at the one
who blew the whistle.

39:32.504 --> 39:33.338
No shit.

39:33.439 --> 39:34.840
Is that right?

39:34.940 --> 39:37.175
After he went private,
no one kept track of

39:37.275 --> 39:39.177
just how many
civilians he mowed down

39:39.277 --> 39:41.012
until I came along
to stop that evil shit,

39:41.212 --> 39:43.782
and yet they're out there
and I'm in here.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.017
Who said the world's fair?

39:51.022 --> 39:52.558
Why are you in here?

39:54.460 --> 39:55.260
Testified 0900.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.600
In shackles? Uh-uh.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.969
Let's just say

40:04.069 --> 40:06.271
my plea deal didn't
save me from crimes

40:06.371 --> 40:10.041
more recently committed
while in detention.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.910
What about this Shattered Dove?

40:14.079 --> 40:15.213
What're you doing here, again?

40:17.348 --> 40:19.050
My little sister's
on this bridge.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.654
And?

40:22.754 --> 40:26.825
And I'm thinking I've been
pretty lucky so far,

40:26.925 --> 40:28.393
but they're gonna
come hunt me down

40:28.494 --> 40:30.662
once they find out
these two guys are dead.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.264
So, if you're what they want,

40:33.364 --> 40:35.834
how about we cooperate
with each other,

40:35.934 --> 40:38.269
and you help me get my little
sister off of this bridge

40:38.369 --> 40:40.105
and away from this
fucking shit show?

40:42.173 --> 40:45.477
Okay.
You have my attention.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.478
Good.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.247
Any of these guys have keys?

40:52.283 --> 40:53.819
To the shackles.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.286
Not the cage.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.091
Then we're
gonna have to improvise.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.666
What the fuck?

41:10.936 --> 41:11.870
Somebody check that out.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.471
Copy. India engaging.

41:15.306 --> 41:19.010
Eric, what have you done?

41:27.753 --> 41:30.488
Romeo, someone shot
the prison guard on the horn.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.160
Come on.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.327
Come on.

41:39.430 --> 41:40.498
That's it.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.134
Smile, you son of a bitch.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.004
Fuck!

41:50.075 --> 41:51.543
What the fuck?
Taking fire!

41:51.643 --> 41:52.678
Sierra's hit!

41:52.778 --> 41:53.979
Everybody go.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.146
Golf here,
on the move.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.516
Shit. Goddammit!
Motherfuckers!

42:06.858 --> 42:08.727
Fucking got Yankee.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.699
We're with Doc.
Yankee KIA.

42:13.799 --> 42:14.733
<i>Did she kill Yankee?</i>

42:16.367 --> 42:18.203
She's caged and shackled.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.871
I took the keys from the driver.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.172
Had them the whole time.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.575
Doc saw who did it.

42:23.675 --> 42:24.542
Amy, is that you?

42:27.813 --> 42:29.180
<i>India, give me the distance,</i>

42:29.280 --> 42:30.381
<i>direction and description
of the shooter.</i>

42:30.616 --> 42:32.117
Are you fucking kidding me?

42:32.217 --> 42:34.419
We've been a little busy
getting shot at.

42:34.519 --> 42:37.055
[over comms] <i>Romeo,
sweeping south. Zip so far.</i>

42:38.624 --> 42:39.190
Shut up.

42:40.491 --> 42:41.860
No sign of the shooter.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.595
Too many places
to hide out here.

42:43.695 --> 42:45.130
<i>And the cops?</i>

42:45.230 --> 42:46.732
They're staying back for now.

42:46.832 --> 42:49.701
If any cop moves
across the gap, waste them.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.369
On it.

42:51.469 --> 42:52.570
<i>Everybody else regroup.</i>

42:58.543 --> 43:00.378
TAC team
is looking for entry points.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.216
Shooter's gone.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.587
You okay?
Hey, hey, hang on.

43:09.688 --> 43:10.989
- Hey, I can walk. I can walk.
- Hang on, I got you.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.058
Christ, what a clusterfuck.

43:13.158 --> 43:14.392
<i>Romeo, this is India.</i>

43:14.492 --> 43:16.628
<i>Permission to extract
intel from Doc.</i>

43:16.728 --> 43:18.263
Negative.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.231
Doc is the star of our show.

43:20.331 --> 43:23.234
Watch her, but do not touch her.

43:36.882 --> 43:38.049
Son of a bitch.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.789
Come on. You've had worse.

43:58.103 --> 43:59.637
We have to flush
this fucker out.

44:01.272 --> 44:02.473
Yankee, how'd he die?

44:02.708 --> 44:04.275
Close contact.
Gun under the vest.

44:04.375 --> 44:05.476
Tango still hasn't checked in.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.012
Captain, he smoked Tango.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.047
This guy kills one of us,
maybe he gets lucky.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.916
Kills two of us? No chance.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.018
Okay, he knows what he's doing.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.052
He's listening.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.186
Watch your chatter.

44:15.286 --> 44:16.855
Echo, Foxtrot, find him.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.089
Golf has overwatch.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.991
We hit fast and we hit hard.

44:20.091 --> 44:21.292
Sir, yes, sir.

44:51.156 --> 44:51.723
Who's that?

44:52.991 --> 44:54.159
Maddie?

44:56.795 --> 44:57.695
Maddie!?

44:57.796 --> 44:58.897
I'm here!

44:59.130 --> 45:01.532
Thank God.

45:05.170 --> 45:07.038
Maddie, you need to answer me

45:07.138 --> 45:09.240
when I call out to you.

45:09.340 --> 45:10.708
The call died.
I thought...

45:12.811 --> 45:13.511
you were...

45:16.647 --> 45:17.382
I'm sorry.

45:19.150 --> 45:19.918
I'm really sorry.

45:20.151 --> 45:22.353
I got you, okay?

45:25.190 --> 45:25.857
<i>This is to the worm who thinks</i>

45:26.191 --> 45:28.927
<i>he can undermine our mission.</i>

45:29.160 --> 45:30.829
That's not you, right?

45:31.096 --> 45:31.729
[over comms] <i>Hide.</i>

45:33.398 --> 45:34.699

you up along with

45:36.367 --> 45:39.137

45:39.237 --> 45:40.738
We're coming for you.

45:43.008 --> 45:44.575
We have to go.

45:44.675 --> 45:46.577
I know a place that's safe.
Come on, follow me.

45:48.013 --> 45:49.781
Shut the door quietly.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.387
No stone unturned.

you prick?

46:14.405 --> 46:15.974
Maddie, back. Back, back.

46:16.074 --> 46:17.108
Try to get in one of the cars.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.810
Come on, Rambo.

46:19.044 --> 46:20.111
Can we get in?

46:20.211 --> 46:22.247
You son of a bitch.

[over comms] <i>Doc and
I are gettin' nice and cozy.</i>

46:28.286 --> 46:29.420
Right.

46:31.056 --> 46:34.092
Who killed Yankee?
And where did he go?

46:34.259 --> 46:36.461
I know it's you, Wade.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.463
How's your night going?
Not so good? Awwww.

46:39.865 --> 46:41.232
Romeo's gonna frag your ass

46:41.432 --> 46:42.567
in front of the entire planet

46:42.733 --> 46:44.435
for the sins
you committed against us.

46:44.535 --> 46:47.272
Romeo is a punk.

46:47.372 --> 46:49.107
But you're just
his punk-ass bitch.

46:49.207 --> 46:50.275
God damn it!

46:50.475 --> 46:53.211
Who killed him?
And where did he go?

46:53.311 --> 46:55.746
Wade,
you candy-ass shit monkey,

46:55.914 --> 46:57.782
even if I told you,
he would gut you

46:57.883 --> 46:59.650

Yankee-doodle dickhead!

46:59.750 --> 47:00.986
That's it!

47:01.219 --> 47:03.054
I'm gonna do worse things
than kill you, Doc.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.389
Get the fuck out of here!

47:04.489 --> 47:05.356
I'm gonna have fun doing this!

- Can we get in, please?
-  No, no. I can't do that.

They won't let us in, Eric.

-  Don't open the door.

Just hurry.
Open the door, chickenshit!

50:37.702 --> 50:38.703
- Not that much.
- Okay. Come on.

Deal.

is just gonna add cops
to the death toll.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.969
I got 50 to 100
innocent lives up there.

55:05.135 --> 55:07.171
I'm begging you.
You gotta release

55:07.271 --> 55:08.673
these Shattered Dove files
and their comrades,

55:08.773 --> 55:09.974
because if you don't,

55:10.074 --> 55:11.509
the only thing I'm
gonna need from you

55:11.609 --> 55:13.511
is a net to drag their damn
bodies out of the river.

55:18.949 --> 55:20.851
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

55:20.951 --> 55:22.887
Well, you're alive.

55:22.987 --> 55:24.955
Better yet, they
think that you aren't.

55:25.055 --> 55:26.491
So, you know, we have
all the time in the world

55:26.591 --> 55:27.525
to get you out of here.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.159
How?

55:29.259 --> 55:30.961
That tow truck
had a winch on it.

55:31.061 --> 55:32.329
May be enough to get us down.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.801
Okay, man.

55:40.070 --> 55:41.539
Coast is clear.

55:41.639 --> 55:44.509
Let's go.
- What is that?

55:48.779 --> 55:49.980
Come on.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.188
We need to get you
out of here right now.

55:58.656 --> 55:59.590
What about
everybody else?

55:59.690 --> 56:00.758
I only care
about you, okay?

56:00.858 --> 56:02.092
Everybody else is
going to die.

56:02.192 --> 56:02.927
There's nothing
I can do about that,

56:03.027 --> 56:03.994
but I can save you.

56:04.094 --> 56:05.396
No, you save everyone.

56:05.496 --> 56:06.897
Not anymore.
That's not what I do.

56:06.997 --> 56:08.332
Please, just-- let's go.

56:08.433 --> 56:09.700
Eric, you are the fucking hero.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.402
I'm not the fucking hero.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.338
I'm not.

56:14.439 --> 56:17.207
I'm not a Ranger anymore.
I'm-- I'm not even Army.

56:17.307 --> 56:19.043
- What?
- They discharged me.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.012
Three weeks before
they pulled us out.

56:22.212 --> 56:25.015
Some tribal warlord we
were protecting was...

56:29.487 --> 56:31.188
Was what?

56:31.288 --> 56:32.923
Some tribal warlord...

56:34.459 --> 56:37.361
was going after this young girl,
no older than you.

56:37.462 --> 56:39.029
She...

56:40.665 --> 56:42.366
she was forced to marry
this old fuck,

56:42.467 --> 56:48.038
and she begged us...
she begged me to save her.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.977
My L.T. said to let it go.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.446
That it was none of our concern.

56:55.546 --> 56:57.515
But I ignored the order.

56:59.684 --> 57:02.753
And I went to reach out, grab
her hand, lead her away,

57:02.853 --> 57:04.254
and the warlord...

57:06.090 --> 57:07.858
shot her in the head.

57:13.263 --> 57:14.431
<i>Right in front of me.</i>

57:16.901 --> 57:19.269
<i>I still feel the blood</i>

57:19.369 --> 57:20.805
on my face.

57:23.273 --> 57:25.275
Maddie, I can't let that be you.

57:25.375 --> 57:26.310
Please.

57:26.410 --> 57:28.412
I can't let you die like that...

57:28.513 --> 57:29.780
And you won't.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.081
But if you save me

57:31.281 --> 57:32.817
and everybody up there dies,

57:32.917 --> 57:36.487
then it's gonna haunt you
worse than that girl, Eric.

57:36.587 --> 57:38.022
I know you.

57:43.393 --> 57:44.194
Do you?

57:44.294 --> 57:45.162
Yeah.

57:45.462 --> 57:46.564
I do.

58:11.756 --> 58:13.824
Well, let's go.

58:13.924 --> 58:15.459
- Okay.
- I got you.

58:15.560 --> 58:16.694
Don't look down.

58:16.794 --> 58:18.028
I won't.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.703
[report continues

58:28.405 --> 58:31.308
Two people attempted
to escape my breach.

58:31.576 --> 58:33.343
<i>They are dead now.</i>

58:33.443 --> 58:35.646
<i>It did not have to be this way.</i>

58:35.746 --> 58:38.082
<i>Do not test us.</i>

58:40.350 --> 58:42.052
Listen, if you choose
war with us,

58:42.152 --> 58:44.922
it will end as all wars do.

58:45.189 --> 58:46.323
<i> In tragedy.</i>

58:53.664 --> 58:55.733
How many viewers
are in the queue?

58:55.833 --> 58:57.067
Over 32 mil.

58:57.167 --> 58:58.468
And what about the cops?

58:58.636 --> 58:59.536
They're staying back.

58:59.637 --> 59:00.537
For now.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.308
They're scared shitless.

59:06.677 --> 59:09.346
Captain, there's still
no Shattered Dove files

59:09.446 --> 59:11.081
or release of
our brothers in arms.

59:11.281 --> 59:12.349
There's no way
they're gonna expose

59:12.449 --> 59:13.918
what they paid us
to do, Captain.

59:14.018 --> 59:15.185
We need extraction.

59:19.489 --> 59:22.226
Then you will find Doc.

59:24.629 --> 59:25.229
Yes, sir.

59:28.032 --> 59:30.367
<i>...death toll,</i>

59:30.635 --> 59:32.803
<i>killing not only
their tactical officers</i>

59:32.903 --> 59:33.938
<i>but innocent hostages</i>

59:34.038 --> 59:35.539
<i>trapped on the Tobin bridge.</i>

59:35.640 --> 59:36.841
Foxtrot.

59:37.041 --> 59:37.942
You got anything?
- Nada.

59:38.042 --> 59:39.877
Doc's a crafty little bitch.

59:40.044 --> 59:40.978
Yeah, well,
crafty bitch or not,

59:41.078 --> 59:42.579
we still gotta find her.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.414
Especially if we're gonna
get off this damn bridge.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.232
Now what are we
going to do with you?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.233
I'll take her.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:07.938
Pretend she's with me.

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:10.174
Eric, come on. Let's go.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:11.241
Maddie, get in the back.

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.849
Thank you.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.651
My name's Ozzie.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:21.451
Eric.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:27.091
How old's your kid?

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.425
He just turned two today.

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:29.660
I was trying to get
back to his party.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:34.832
Maddie's 16.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:35.900
Madeleine.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.437
You really think
you can stop him?

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:41.505
I know he can.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.209
Well...

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.111
apparently that's
what I'm here for.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.813
Call Ma, tell her you're okay.

01:00:48.913 --> 01:00:50.815
If Ozzie tells you
to do anything,

01:00:50.915 --> 01:00:53.183
listen. Understand?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.284
Take it.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.186
In case you need to call.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:57.187
Pass code's

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:58.689
1-2-3-4-5-6.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.992
Mine's 6-5-4-3-2-1.

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:05.329
- It's okay?
- I'm good. Go.

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:09.767
Keep her safe.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:13.938
Please.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:55.545
Guess you're not dead.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.049
Going somewhere?

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.696
Stop! Move up! Move up!

01:02:12.797 --> 01:02:13.864
Go, go, go! Move! Move!

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.733
Doc's behind the red car!

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:19.203
We're taking fire! Taking fire!

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.939
Move up! Move up! Move up!

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:22.873
Positioning, damn it!

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:24.141
Move it! Move!

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.011
Echo, go, go!

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:31.415
Hey, I said I want Doc alive!

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:32.649
<i>
Then get out here</i>

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.418
<i>and do it yourself, Jimmy!</i>

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:39.556
Oh. Where you going?

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:41.625
I'm gonna do it myself.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.562
Keep the distance!
Keep the distance!

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:46.797
Foxtrot, on your left!
On your left!

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:48.332
On your left!

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.399
Go, go, go! Move!

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.501
Move it!

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.447
Hey, Timex.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.150
You take a lickin'
and keep on tickin'.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.018
Good on you, kid.
-  Thank you, sir.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:10.354
They wired the whole
underside of the bridge.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:11.788
Oh, man.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.324
You got sapper skills?

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:16.827
Some. Enough, I hope.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.695
All right.
I got wire cutters.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:19.663
Tools.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.632
How about the winch?

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.268
Winch only works
if the ignition's powered,

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.937
but fuckers took my keys.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.072
But, uh...

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:31.341
once a Boy Scout...

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:34.444
Hoowah!

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.483
Move! Let's go!

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.619
Come on, chickenshit!

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:44.288
I'll back you up!

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.862
You really need to
stop making me look bad, Doc.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.231
<i>Roken's threats against inmate</i>

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.000
<i>Samantha "Doc" Brown</i>

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.068
<i>appear to be at the center
of this crisis.</i>

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.870
<i>Brown recently
surrendered to authorities</i>

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.872
<i>to give evidence
against Roken and his--</i>

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.040
Fuck.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:08.412
I'd hoped I was done with these.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.215
You will be
free of them soon enough.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.050
Is that supposed to scare me?

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.186
Captain Chaos?

01:04:22.927 --> 01:04:25.029
What the fuck, Jimmy?
You drunk?

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:26.964
No. No. Just--

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.034
fallin' apart,

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.970
much like this bridge
over troubled waters.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:40.677
This isn't some kind of

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.048
fucked-up frat boy
revenge hit, is it?

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.515
Why don't you
confess your sins

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.052
and die with a clear conscience?

01:04:48.152 --> 01:04:50.620
I don't get the whole
hostage terrorism thing.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.090
Luckily nobody's paying you

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:54.691
to get shit, Doc.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.093
Right, right, right.

01:04:57.194 --> 01:04:59.729
So, what's the deal?

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.632
You doing this to try
and prove a point?

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.935
Well, I call it bullshit.

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.536
This isn't about
releasing some documents

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.940
or freeing some fuckwits
you could give two shits about.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.944
This is some
kind of magic show.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.712
There's nothing
up my sleeves, Doc.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.716
I want the masters
who unleashed us

01:05:19.816 --> 01:05:21.651
to pay for their sins.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.387
Do right by us dogs

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:25.122
who bite on their behalf.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:27.157
Oh, please!

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.493
Save the performance
for the cameras.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.028
Just us girls here.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.966
Spill, tough guy.
What gives?

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:37.968
The world needs to know
that the men behind the curtains

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:41.138
are scared little shits
who use and lose us.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:43.740
See, we're not human
anymore, just the ultimate

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.909
"fire and forget" weapons.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.144
We're over 47 million.

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.145
Dollars?

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:49.746
Viewers.

01:05:53.017 --> 01:05:56.486
Plan is to make you famous
before you die, Doc.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:58.488
Well, at least I
get to die with my honor

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.290
and not as some
murdering asshole.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:01.825
You know what I think?

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:05.162
I don't think you know
the first thing about...

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:07.764
honor.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.279
Afinitor?

01:06:22.446 --> 01:06:25.349
Cancer drugs.

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:26.550
What the fuck, Jimmy?

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.785
Oh, son.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:32.156
Gift from the burn pits
and chemical deterrents;

01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:35.192
a brain tumor
the size of a golf ball.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.562
I've not got a whole
lot of time left,

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:39.663
but hey...

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.167
What are you gonna do?

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:44.301
Christ, Jimmy.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.971
No wonder you're doing
something so batshit crazy.

01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:49.839
You're off your goddamn nut...

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.642
I am more lucid
than I have ever been.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.182
If you want to
do right by the people

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:02.419
on this bridge, then
you will do your part.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.653
If you fail to do that,

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.222
their deaths,

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.890
that's on you.

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:25.041
Oh, shit.

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:32.849
What the fuck?

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:39.889
Ah, shit.

01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:48.698
Romeo,
there's a line over the side.

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:49.866
<i>
Copy, Foxtrot.</i>

01:07:49.966 --> 01:07:51.268
<i>Catch and kill. No one leaves.</i>

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.103
How the hell
did we miss this?

01:07:53.203 --> 01:07:54.704
-  Hey, guys.
-  Hey! Hey!

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.940
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.643
You guys had a tough time
tonight, huh?

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:00.877
How you free, old timer?

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.646
Oh, well, you don't
get to be my age

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:03.813
without learning a trick or two.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.914
Yeah, I bet.

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.049
Who's over the side?

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.083
Oh, what?
You mean this thing?

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.618
Oh, well.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.387
Would you believe it?
I got hungry.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.289
I-- I thought
I'd fish for my dinner.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:14.658
No, I fucking wouldn't.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.126
- Well--
-  Watch him.

01:08:17.561 --> 01:08:18.628
You see the hook
on the end of this thing?

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.730
It's huge.
- Stop, old man. Shut up.

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:28.905
Shit.
I got veteran plates here.

01:08:29.005 --> 01:08:30.574
That guy who made a break
for it earlier.

01:08:30.674 --> 01:08:32.309
That dude's at the bottom
of the river, man.

01:08:32.409 --> 01:08:33.510
Yeah, or not.

01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:34.778
This prick is one of us.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.151
Where'd he go? Huh?

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.352
What, the fish?
How should I know?

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:43.987
He had a girl
with him, right?

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:45.355
- Yeah. There was.
- No, no, no, no, no, guys.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.257
I mean, listen,
listen. Let me explain.

01:08:48.592 --> 01:08:50.026
Shit.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.095
Damn!

01:08:52.196 --> 01:08:53.129
Shit!

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:01.305
- All right. Come on.
- Fucking fuck.

01:09:01.405 --> 01:09:02.972
Ooh, eloquent dipshit,
ain't ya?

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.474
- Yeah. All right.
-  Come on.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.277
Eloquent, my ass.

01:09:14.784 --> 01:09:18.054
You're leaking now, old man.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.556
Yeah.

01:09:21.458 --> 01:09:23.193
Oh, shit.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.464
I hope he gets you next.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.371
We'll see.

01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:35.372
Take this shit.

01:09:35.472 --> 01:09:36.373
Who's gonna get me?

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:38.375
Aaah!

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:48.017
Foxtrot?!

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:56.426
- You good?
- This old motherfucker

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.327
stabbed me in my ass.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.730
Camp the line.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.031
He's gotta come up
sooner or later.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.767
If he's alive, so is that girl.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:06.069
I'm gonna find her.
- Old bastard.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.785
Madeleine, call your brother.

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:25.622
Quick, cover the cut up.

01:10:33.297 --> 01:10:34.130
Maddie?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.432
Maddie?

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:40.504
- Hi.
-  Howdy.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.076
Tango must have missed
zip-tieing you two.

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.379
It's no wonder he's dead.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.781
Uh-- yeah,
I-- I don't know.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.116
Mm-hmm.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:56.586
Who we got here?

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:57.454
What's her story?

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.822
She adopted?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.056
I'm the babysitter.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:02.292
Oh.
Babysitter.

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:03.760
Nice.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.462
<i>No, she takes care of my son.</i>

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:06.896
[over phone] <i>Right.</i>

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:10.166
And what's
his son's name?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.435
Eh?

01:11:11.535 --> 01:11:13.537
- His name's--
- I was asking her.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.107
You were saying?

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:21.945
Jake, you know?
Little-- little guy?

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.480
Jake Little Guy.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.081
Hmm.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:30.820
Get that babysitting? Huh?

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.255
Out of the car.

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.323
Come on.
-  Wait.

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:34.658
- Get out. Let's go.
- Eric! Eric!

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.125
- No, no.
-  You're coming with me.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:37.661
-  <i>Wait. Let me go!</i>
-  <i>Shut up.</i>

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:38.695
-  [over phone] <i>Eric!
-</i>  Come on.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:39.596
Let's go, babysitter.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.366
-  <i>Eric!</i>
-  Come on.

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:43.733
<i>Stop struggling. Let's go.</i>
-  <i>Eric! Be the hero!</i>

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.502
and move!

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:46.503
Don't, asshole.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.949
Let's go.

01:12:00.384 --> 01:12:01.951
Guess who's still alive.

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:12.962
Un-fucking-real.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.197
Start talking.

01:12:14.297 --> 01:12:15.331
Who are you?
Who are you with?

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:16.132
Ow!

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.212
Eric!

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:31.180
Speak up.
Mean it, sweetheart.

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:35.985
Eric!

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.558
Does that voice
sound familiar, Eric?

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:44.928
I am speaking

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.397
with Corporal Eric Daniels.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:48.765
U.S. Army Ranger.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.300
True American hero.

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:53.770
I need to know you are
done giving me shit,

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.004
and I need to know it by 21:00,

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.372
Eastern Standard Time.

01:12:56.473 --> 01:12:57.741
By my calculations,

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.843
that gives us about two
minutes and 40 seconds

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:02.311
before I shoot
your little sister in the head.

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:03.780
How fast can you get here?

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.583
Shoulda stayed at home.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:07.250
Don't worry.

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:10.920
He won't let anything
happen to you.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.056
One hundred seconds, Corporal!

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:17.594
Sixty seconds, Eric!

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.734
It's me! It's me!

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:28.738
I couldn't stop him.

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:31.340
You beg him to save you.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:32.208
Eric...

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.645
You break their bones,
make them bleed.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.981
Kill the motherfuckers!
- Very feisty girl, Eric!

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:39.449
Must run in the family.

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:41.084
It's unfortunate
because she's only got

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.754
about 17 more seconds to live.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:45.989
I need a diversion.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:48.357
Use this, then run.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.059
Ten seconds!

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.561
Cut the fuckin' shit, Jimmy!

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:52.629
Six seconds.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:53.963
Captain.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:57.266
Move! Stay the fuck back!

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.836
Eric!

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.638
I'm fucking sick of this!

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:04.407
Wait, wait.

01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:05.108
Wait.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.076
Wait. Wait.

01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:11.080
Let's go say hi.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.382
I'm here.

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:14.751
Wait.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.419
I'm here.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.254
I'm here. Don't hurt her.

01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:20.657
I'm here.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:21.658
Eric.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:23.660
Eric.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.497
Hi.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.309
It's online. All of it.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.579
We did it. They're scared
shitless of us.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.682
Yeah.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.589
Comfy? No?

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.828
Eric?

01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:00.163
You okay?

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:04.367
You ready?

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:05.802
Say the word.

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:08.071
You will read every
word verbatim.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.806
Mistakes will hurt.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.611
I'm not reading this.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:17.714
The mistakes will hurt her.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:19.182
I'll fucking end you.

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.354
I'll do it.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.391
I'll do it!

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:30.827

01:17:37.721 --> 01:17:39.222
if he says the wrong thing.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.057
Go on.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:44.961
The world's watching, Eric.
Make it good.

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:48.164
My name is
Corporal Eric Matthew Daniels,

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.399
U.S. Army.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.803
I did two tours.
I even earned a medal.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.005
I was demoted

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.874
for dismissing bad orders

01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:01.210
that would have prevented me
from saving civilian lives.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.780
I know all about PTSD. Uh--

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.517
I, too, escaped a bad situation

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.319
where plenty of others didn't.

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.523
You know, the, uh,

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:18.327
right way isn't always obvious.

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.662
Sometimes it seems like

01:18:19.763 --> 01:18:21.664
there isn't even a point.

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:23.166
The hell are
you even babbling about?

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:24.667
Just say your piece, man.

01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:27.670
I was pistol whipped.

01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:30.106
My head's really fuzzy.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:33.743
I'm exhausted. And...

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:35.711
I don't know if these
guys are guilty.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:40.049
Maybe they are.
Maybe they aren't.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.920
But I know this--

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.588
for all this country
gets wrong...

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:48.391
it gets a lot right.

01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:51.260
And I'm willing
to fight for that.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.695
Shut his
ass up, already.

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:53.863
- I've had enough.
-  Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:54.898
Wait.

01:18:54.998 --> 01:18:56.732
Just one more thing.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:57.967
Ma...

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:03.406
if you're watching this...

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.551
We got explosions.
North side.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:17.553
Check it out.
We're at less than half.

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:18.721
It's the perfect time
to attack us.

01:19:18.822 --> 01:19:19.956
What the hell was that?

01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:21.490
SWAT or ATF or some shit--

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.926
Listen to me, Daniels.

01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:25.328
If this has anything
to do with you,

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:27.964
I swear you and your
sister are done.

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:28.965
You got me?

01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:30.333
You under--

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:41.177
Maddie, go.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:57.793
Come on, kid. Let's go.

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:58.828
Eric!

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:01.597
Come on.

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:08.804
Okay. Get down.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:14.443
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Let's move.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:41.170
Eric, I will tell you what.

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:42.805
You have made your point.

01:20:42.906 --> 01:20:44.840
If you come closer,
I'll make another.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:54.017
Echo.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:13.069
Easy there, Army Puke.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:20.876
Yo Doc, you bitch!

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.850
Oh, my God.

01:21:27.951 --> 01:21:28.884
Are you shot?

01:21:28.985 --> 01:21:30.086
Yeah.

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:34.890
<i>This is just in.
Our news team on the bridge</i>

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.527
<i>to survey the current--</i>
- Widen it out.

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.029
terror situation on the Tobin.

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:42.731
<i>This drone is armed with
a small-caliber weapon.</i>

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.568
Looks like most of
the terrorists are gone.

01:21:45.668 --> 01:21:47.036
I don't know who the hell's
taking them out,

01:21:47.303 --> 01:21:49.038
but looks like we might have
caught the break we need.

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:50.739
You sure the sniper mode
on this thing works?

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.114
Give me a sec.

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.952
Ozzie!

01:22:03.052 --> 01:22:04.120
You saved us.

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:06.755
You forgot this.

01:22:11.494 --> 01:22:12.595
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.510
The cops won't
wait, you're done.

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.413
Not until I finish
what I started.

01:22:30.846 --> 01:22:32.415
With a shot-to-shit camera?

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:34.117
With a goddamn phone,
if I have to!

01:22:34.217 --> 01:22:35.985
See, Doc dies on camera.

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:37.920
No compromises.

01:22:38.021 --> 01:22:38.988
You're fucked in the head.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:44.327
You are more
right than you know.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.695
I am righteously
fucked in my head.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.364
See, there is a burning
in my brain

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.299
that won't stop
until I stop breathing.

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:51.034
All of this...

01:22:51.134 --> 01:22:52.501
everything...

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.138
that is my last will
and testament, my legacy,

01:22:55.238 --> 01:22:56.205
so that everyone in this country

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.640
knows what happened here tonight

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.808
was not done by
some foreign entity

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:03.012
but by patriots who just
couldn't take it anymore.

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.081
Dude, I don't care.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:06.349
Please stop talking.

01:23:06.449 --> 01:23:07.283
You're giving me a headache.

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:08.651
If you got no more guys

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.719
to follow your stupid orders...

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.156
stop.

01:23:13.256 --> 01:23:14.223
I got you, Eric.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.925
Don't I?

01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:19.195
Either you get me Doc,

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:21.164
or I let go of this.

01:23:21.264 --> 01:23:22.398
Dead man's trigger, Eric.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:25.668
I let this go, we all die.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:29.938
- Did you?
- It's over.

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:31.974
It's over, man.

01:23:32.075 --> 01:23:33.742
Contingencies, man.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:35.411
And I got plenty.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.981
You think I can't kill
everybody on this bridge,

01:23:39.082 --> 01:23:40.216
you are dead wrong.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.723
I know how to make C4
look like fireworks.

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:49.325
This is over

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.660
when I say it's over.

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:55.664
Now bring me Doc.

01:24:02.138 --> 01:24:03.072
Eric?

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:04.373
Maddie. Thank God.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:05.841
Are you okay?

01:24:09.612 --> 01:24:11.013
I just got to check.
You got me?

01:24:11.114 --> 01:24:12.981
Wait.

01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:14.417
Did you disarm all the bombs?

01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:16.385
Yes, I-- on the bridge, but--

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:18.521
But he's got a contingency.

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:22.691
Enough to blow us all to hell.

01:24:24.327 --> 01:24:25.694
He want me?

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:29.232
Yeah.

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:30.733
Eric, you can't. She--

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.901
Maddie, there's
nothing that we can do.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:36.705
All these people...

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:41.910
they're gonna die
if we don't do something.

01:24:55.224 --> 01:24:56.725
Why were you in that cage?

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:01.397
You wanna know
if I'm worth saving?

01:25:04.267 --> 01:25:07.136
Because I killed a couple of
gangbangers in lockup,

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:09.538
protecting a girl
who couldn't protect herself.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.608
And I'd do it again.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:16.912
I know that feeling.

01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:20.749
So, what now?

01:25:22.185 --> 01:25:23.519
One for extraction.

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:24.420
I'll meet you downriver.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.454
[over comms] <i>Copy.</i>

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:29.292
<i>Extraction team incoming.</i>

01:25:36.199 --> 01:25:36.765
You want what?

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:44.373
Files exposed, four numbnuts
that got caught freed?

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.176
Hire a hacker, get a lawyer.

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:49.278
You're not a zealot.

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.079
You're not.

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:54.817
This is the plan
of someone sick.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.118
Sick in the head.

01:25:56.219 --> 01:25:59.154
I need them
to listen to me, Doc.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:01.824
I'm trying.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.660
Well, you got their attention.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.195
You've won!
- No, no, see--

01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:08.897
maybe I have their attention,
but I have not won.

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:09.798
Not yet.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:14.403
Disarm the dead man's trigger.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.405
Let these people live!

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.706
No, you need to die, Doc.

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:19.475
Everyone here needs to die.

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.910
That is the only way that the
men in charge will do something!

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.480
Then why are
you still running?

01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:26.315
You won't live long enough

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:29.151
to fight another day!

01:26:29.252 --> 01:26:30.686
You said it yourself!

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.224
Do it!

01:26:35.424 --> 01:26:36.325
Shoot me!

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:37.360
Then all of us go!

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:38.761
Okay, okay, please.

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.229
Don't do it. Please. Please.

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:41.330
There's another way.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:42.565
Oh, you should have
thought of that

01:26:42.665 --> 01:26:43.766
before you tried to sucker me.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.141
Back up!

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:56.445
You stay back!

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:01.584
<i>Back off!</i>

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:02.785
That's a dead man's switch
in his hand.

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:03.619
Get that thing out of there now.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.620
Get it out of there.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.054
Everybody off the bridge!

01:27:10.293 --> 01:27:11.159
Stay back!

01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:12.194
Wait, wait, wait.

01:27:12.295 --> 01:27:13.396
No, Eric!

01:27:13.496 --> 01:27:15.030
You need to wait!

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:16.732
See, you need to die!

01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:19.535
From the ashes...

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.872
I will surrender myself

01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:25.874
to a world...

01:27:28.377 --> 01:27:30.713
screaming for my blood.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.881
Then...

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:39.054
they will learn with
my dying breath.

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:41.089
They will know my truth.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:48.464
See ya.

01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:49.798
Jimmy!

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.907
<i>Extraction team in position.</i>

01:28:02.378 --> 01:28:03.211
Come on.

01:28:15.391 --> 01:28:16.925
Turn, you double shit.

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:30.939
Come on!

01:29:24.259 --> 01:29:25.160
You are hard to kill.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:29.197
So are you, kid.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:47.082
<i>It's been three weeks</i>

01:29:47.349 --> 01:29:49.017
<i>since the hostage-taking
on the Tobin Bridge.</i>

01:29:49.284 --> 01:29:51.454
<i>Four members of
the Retcon 13 have been freed</i>

01:29:51.554 --> 01:29:54.356
<i>in light of the Pentagon's
exposed Shattered Dove files.</i>

01:29:54.457 --> 01:29:56.224
<i>Congressional hearings
are scheduled to expose</i>

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:59.027
<i>any further misuse of
military contractors.</i>

01:30:01.464 --> 01:30:02.431
Oh.

01:30:02.665 --> 01:30:03.599
How you doing, darlin'?

01:30:03.699 --> 01:30:05.067
Alive, thanks to you.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.635
Oh, you can
thank your brother.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.170
He's the inspiration.

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:10.238
I would've taken my chances
and jumped off that bridge.

01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:13.375
Freed for valor
and heroism under fire.

01:30:13.476 --> 01:30:15.043
Nice.

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:17.880
Well, that and four bucks
will buy you a cup of coffee.

01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:19.582
