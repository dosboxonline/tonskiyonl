02:34.363 --> 02:35.781
What is this place?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.384
My life doesn't really make sense.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.677
Hey.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.555
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.892
"Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?

03:04.059 --> 03:05.853
"Why are you time traveling
with Captain America?

03:06.061 --> 03:07.521
"That doesn't make sense."

03:09.356 --> 03:10.941
A lot has changed about my life.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.652
But everywhere I go,
people ask me the same thing.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.987
Can you take a picture with my dog?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.531
"Scott, what about now?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.740
"What's next?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.325
"Where does the ride take you?"

03:21.159 --> 03:23.203
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.371
All right.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.959
-It's been a crazy few years. For everyone.
-Hey, hi. How are you?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.544
Everything is ready for you.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.712
You're too much.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.255
No, no, no.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.506
Your money's no good here.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.092
-Are we still talking about that?
-Yes, of course.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.553
Rubin, you are the best.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.264
Thank you, Spider-Man.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.977
So, let's make time for the stuff
that really matters.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.353
Like friends.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.148
Friends you didn't even know you had.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.235
Remember the people who got you here.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.653
You couldn't have done it without them.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.657
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired
from Baskin-Robbins.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.243
Sometimes you just get lucky.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.370
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.914
I think you know who she is.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.167
She's taken back her dad's company.

04:10.375 --> 04:13.086
Now she's using the Pym Particle
for global change.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.507
A lot of people say they want
to save the world...

04:16.673 --> 04:18.466
but Hope, she saves it every day.

04:18.634 --> 04:19.635
Thank you.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.429
Thank you so much.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.517
Reforestation. Affordable housing.
Food production.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.268
She's not wasting a second.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.527
I still can't believe it.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.029
None of this should have happened.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.197
But it did.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.825
It's a pretty good world.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.702
I'm glad we saved it.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.539
"Do I miss the action?

04:49.540 --> 04:50.832
"Sometimes.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.377
"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?

04:53.544 --> 04:54.503
"Absolutely.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.421
"I'd never turn my back on them.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.425
"But right now, the only job I want
is being a dad.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.011
"I love you, Cassie.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.681
"Thanks for being my hero.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.309
"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.272
"And for the rest of you kids out there...

05:13.438 --> 05:14.565
"word of advice.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.067
"Look out for the little guy.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.485
"Make mistakes.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.696
"Take chances.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.782
"Because if there's one thing
life's taught me...

05:23.949 --> 05:27.369
"there's always room to grow."

05:33.667 --> 05:35.294
Sorry, that's me.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.422
Why is jail calling?

05:39.965 --> 05:40.924
Lang!

05:42.092 --> 05:43.844
-Lang!
-I'm here.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.429
All right, come on. Let's go.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.515
Come on.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.980
Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?

05:55.147 --> 05:56.148
Not yet. No.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.567
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.527
Cassie. What happened?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
Sign here.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.698
You know, just jail stuff.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.491
Give it back.

06:07.951 --> 06:08.911
I know it was you.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.078
Are you sure?

06:10.245 --> 06:11.455
I mean, it was kind of hard to see...

06:11.622 --> 06:14.499
through all that tear gas you fired
into the park full of peaceful protestors.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.417
Where is it?

06:15.584 --> 06:17.628
I'm sorry.
This must be really embarrassing for you.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.799
I did find this though.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.681
You shrank a cop car?

06:29.848 --> 06:30.933
What were you thinking?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.851
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.937
They were clearing out a homeless camp
in the middle of the night.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.855
-No, I'm not saying that...
-And where do they expect them to go?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.941
It's not their fault that they lost
their homes in the Blip.

06:39.107 --> 06:39.942
I know that.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.028
No one can even afford rent right now,
unless you're some trust-fund asshole.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.279
I'm not telling you what to do.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.739
-I'm just saying...
-Telling her what to do.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.241
Telling me exactly what to do.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.867
No, you do what you want.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.661
I'm suggesting another way to do it.

06:50.994 --> 06:51.995
Okay.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.455
You know, I promised your mom...

06:53.622 --> 06:56.083
that you would only use this stuff
when one of us was around.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.251
It's really dangerous tech.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.752
I know it's dangerous.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.171
What if the cops took it from you?
What if you lost it?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.339
I didn't lose the suit.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.340
You have a suit?

07:03.507 --> 07:04.716
Wait, you have a suit?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.260
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.303
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.514
Ouch.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.560
-I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
-I know.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.019
That's okay. It's all right.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.271
I get it.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.982
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.942
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...

07:22.109 --> 07:23.986
tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.613
I've never had a normal life.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.408
How about some music?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.077
"And in that moment, all I could think was...

07:32.244 --> 07:34.538
"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.540
"'Will I be a baby forever?

07:36.707 --> 07:37.958
"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'"

07:38.125 --> 07:39.835
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

07:40.002 --> 07:42.379
-"But I was ready for anything.
-Hmm? No, that's...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.089
-It's just the radio.
-"Steve and I grew close over that."

07:44.256 --> 07:45.757
-Dad, turn it off.
-It's so weird.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.759
Something's wrong with this switch.
It won't turn off.

07:47.926 --> 07:48.969
I said turn it off.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.345
What's that? Turn it up? All right.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.098
"A little after that,
a raccoon from space showed up.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.892
"I don't think he knew my name.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.394
"I was just happy to meet a raccoon
who could talk."

08:00.689 --> 08:02.107
Excuse me.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.358
Thank you.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.236
All right.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.406
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.117
It better be. I just saved eight bucks.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.244
God, I admire you.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.621
Thank you.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.415
I missed this.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.334
No pizza in the Quantum Realm?

08:21.126 --> 08:23.420
No. No anything.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.839
You know, Mom, you can talk about it.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.382
If you want.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.552
Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.139
I wanna live right now.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.395
So, Cassie, did you make any new friends
in the slammer this time?

08:41.563 --> 08:42.648
Grandpa.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.107
"This time"?

08:44.900 --> 08:45.734
Was there a last time?

08:45.901 --> 08:47.819
I mean, last time barely counts.

08:48.946 --> 08:49.947
I didn't know that.

08:50.113 --> 08:50.989
Why didn't you call me?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.407
'Cause I knew you'd be like this.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.409
I would've just broken you out with ants.

08:54.576 --> 08:55.911
All right, you know what? Family meeting.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.079
Can we have a family meeting?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.247
Isn't that what we're doing?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.373
Yeah, I mean about this.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.416
About everybody being so fine with this.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.420
Look, you wanna help. I get it.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.089
I do, Cassie. I really do.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.507
But I don't want you wasting your life.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.801
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.013
I literally saved the world.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.014
Oh, did you?

09:16.181 --> 09:17.891
Well, yeah, you never mentioned
that before.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.685
Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world.

09:19.852 --> 09:21.019
How was that for you, Scott?

09:21.186 --> 09:22.479
You should write a book about it.

09:22.646 --> 09:24.064
Ha ha. Hilarious.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.108
Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.734
And what do you do now?

09:29.570 --> 09:30.904
Sign books?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.907
Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?

09:34.408 --> 09:35.784
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way
to Germany...

09:35.951 --> 09:37.911
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.247
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.000
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.168
Not insane.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.461
People still need help, Dad.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.257
At least we're trying to do something
that matters.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.803
Who's "we"?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
What are you three up to?

09:59.016 --> 10:00.017
Science.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.395
With ants.

10:04.313 --> 10:05.564
Ant science.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.108
I don't believe you.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.320
Let's just show him.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.825
What are they building?

10:16.992 --> 10:18.118
Are you doing this?

10:18.285 --> 10:21.496
Actually, no, they built their own tech.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.123
Pretty smart ants.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.042
Okay, so when you were all...

10:25.209 --> 10:28.212
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.672
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's
old journals...

10:30.839 --> 10:32.799
and I got really into the Quantum Realm
and...

10:33.675 --> 10:34.676
The Quantum Realm?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.180
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out...

10:38.347 --> 10:39.264
but we've been talking about it.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.849
She had some questions, okay?

10:41.016 --> 10:44.186
I can't help if people are inspired by me.

10:46.522 --> 10:49.358
So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.277
Why didn't you ask me about it?

10:52.444 --> 10:54.530
I tried, Mom.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.822
A lot.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.658
You never wanted to talk about it.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.076
Cassie's just been curious...

10:59.243 --> 11:00.911
and we gave her some pointers.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.706
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.876
You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is.

11:08.043 --> 11:08.877
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.587
Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.589
That's why we made this.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.134
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.222
But Quantum.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.851
We just need a map.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.437
And then we can study and explore
the entire Quantum Realm.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.357
Never even have to go.

11:30.524 --> 11:35.404
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble Telescope in a basement.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.868
You know, if I had something like this
when you were gone...

11:43.871 --> 11:45.205
then I could have found you.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.710
It's amazing.

11:50.752 --> 11:51.962
I'm blown away.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.674
How does it work?

11:55.841 --> 11:58.802
It's kinda like that two-way radio
we used to have.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.888
You send a signal down from here...

12:01.054 --> 12:03.015
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

12:03.182 --> 12:04.141
Wait. Wait a minute.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.103
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

12:09.813 --> 12:10.814
Yeah.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.192
-Shut it down now.
-Janet...

12:13.358 --> 12:15.068
-Why would we shut it...
-What's wrong?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.320
You have to turn it off!

12:16.486 --> 12:18.030
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

12:21.575 --> 12:22.784
Janet?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.498
There's something I should have told...

13:02.783 --> 13:03.700
Dad?

13:06.620 --> 13:07.579
No!

13:07.746 --> 13:09.248
-No!
-Mom!

13:09.790 --> 13:11.166
No!

13:12.543 --> 13:13.544
Damn it!

13:15.671 --> 13:16.630
Dad?

13:48.954 --> 13:49.955
Dad!

13:55.544 --> 13:56.712
Dad!

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
Cassie.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.453
Dad!

14:29.912 --> 14:31.330
Oh, Dad. Come on.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.540
Okay.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.541
Are you okay?

14:34.708 --> 14:35.834
Yeah. I'm okay.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.310
Where are we?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.412
Mom!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.040
Dad!

15:15.207 --> 15:16.917
Hope. Over here.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.587
Are you okay?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.006
We should be dead.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.008
Why aren't we?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.385
I don't know.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.930
Are we where I think we are?

15:30.681 --> 15:32.307
I would say yes...

15:33.600 --> 15:34.810
but it wasn't like this.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.186
Janet!

15:36.603 --> 15:37.604
Mom!

15:38.730 --> 15:39.731
Janet!

15:41.400 --> 15:42.401
Mom!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.623
Do not move.

16:15.184 --> 16:16.685
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

16:17.895 --> 16:18.896
Right now.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.860
Hope? Hope?

16:25.027 --> 16:26.945
Hank? Can you hear me?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.532
-Can anyone hear me?
-Oh, my God.

16:32.075 --> 16:33.076
-It's okay.
-What are we gonna do?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.037
It's okay. It's okay. We're okay.

16:35.204 --> 16:36.246
We're okay. It's gonna be okay.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.497
You're saying "okay" too much.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.833
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.876
We're okay.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.044
We are fine.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.588
Hey, we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.840
In the meantime, look around.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.217
It's beautiful.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.635
All right? We're outside.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.513
It's like we're camping. We love camping.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.847
We've never been camping.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.683
But we've always talked about it.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.232
Is that sun moving?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.202
Get back!

17:19.957 --> 17:20.832
Oh, my God.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.417
I don't think this is a sun!

17:24.252 --> 17:25.253
It's fine.

17:25.546 --> 17:27.464
-Dad!
-Honey, it's okay.

17:27.631 --> 17:28.632
Still okay.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.934
Dad. Oh, my God.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.102
That was weird.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.483
Run.

18:15.012 --> 18:18.390
There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?

18:18.557 --> 18:19.558
Yeah.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.810
I didn't know that either.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.316
What was that back there, Mom?

18:27.482 --> 18:29.109
What was that ship looking for?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.986
Keep your voice down.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.238
You said there was nothing down here.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.740
Why didn't you tell us about all of this?

18:34.907 --> 18:36.533
Hope, I will explain everything,
but right now...

18:36.700 --> 18:38.535
-I just need you to trust me.
-Then make me trust you!

18:38.702 --> 18:41.246
Let's just calm down, all right?
We can talk about this...

18:41.413 --> 18:43.498
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.875
No, you need to tell us what's...

18:45.042 --> 18:47.419
Why didn't you listen?
I told you to stay away from here.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.339
Janet, I'm so sorry.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.800
I should have told you what we were doing.
I had no idea...

18:53.967 --> 18:54.968
I know. It's...

18:56.094 --> 18:57.304
We'll talk later.

18:57.471 --> 18:59.264
Right now, we stick together...

19:00.098 --> 19:01.600
we find Scott and Cassie...

19:02.351 --> 19:03.852
and we go home. Okay?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.354
-Okay?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.522
-Okay.

19:06.688 --> 19:07.689
Stay close.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.448
This is incredible.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.451
I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.996
Why didn't I see any of this?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.541
You weren't able to look deep enough.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.168
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.255
There are worlds here...

19:31.421 --> 19:33.131
worlds within worlds.

19:34.383 --> 19:37.886
It's a place outside time and space.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.849
It's a secret universe...

19:42.182 --> 19:43.809
beneath ours.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.874
Hey, get your hands off me!

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
Cassie?

20:17.593 --> 20:18.635
Where's my daughter?

20:20.679 --> 20:21.805
Where is she?

20:22.890 --> 20:23.891
Cassie?

20:27.853 --> 20:28.854
Where's my daughter?

20:32.482 --> 20:33.483
Cassie!

20:36.153 --> 20:37.154
Dad!

20:37.988 --> 20:38.989
Cassie!

20:39.573 --> 20:41.116
Drink the ooze.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.535
What?

21:05.641 --> 21:06.850
I'll handle this.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.115
Mom.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.130
Was that a good stab?

22:18.714 --> 22:20.048
I got us a ride.

22:39.276 --> 22:40.402
He's friendly.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.404
Quite a ride.

22:42.571 --> 22:45.490
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

22:45.657 --> 22:46.575
I like ants.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.036
And I love that you love them. Here.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.080
These will help us blend in.

22:52.831 --> 22:55.751
Where exactly are we going on this?

22:55.918 --> 22:57.669
We're not too far from an old friend of mine.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.713
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are...

23:00.672 --> 23:01.798
it'll be him.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.675
After you.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.803
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.269
Let me go! Let me go!

23:25.447 --> 23:26.949
I don't know what you're saying!

23:27.741 --> 23:28.951
I don't know what you...

23:47.761 --> 23:48.846
No! No!

23:58.438 --> 24:00.065
Drink the ooze!

24:00.232 --> 24:01.567
Drink the ooze!

24:01.942 --> 24:03.610
Drink the ooze!

24:03.777 --> 24:05.112
Drink the ooze!

24:06.864 --> 24:07.781
Hello.

24:07.948 --> 24:08.866
Hi. Hi.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.450
Did you drink the ooze?

24:12.119 --> 24:13.412
Why can I understand you?

24:13.704 --> 24:14.663
Great. That's the ooze.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.707
Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!

24:20.460 --> 24:21.837
We can finally be friends.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.172
Hi. I am Veb.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.298
You just drank me.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.674
I did... What?

24:25.841 --> 24:26.967
Do you need some more ooze? Here.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.052
-I can pour some ooze into your hole...
-No, I'm okay.

24:29.219 --> 24:30.762
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
-Oh, wow!

24:30.929 --> 24:32.347
A big hole.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.183
How many holes do you have?

24:34.892 --> 24:36.185
I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?

24:36.351 --> 24:37.936
I don't have any holes.

24:38.103 --> 24:40.147
His name is Scott Lang.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.566
He has seven holes.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.572
Yeah, that's right.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.490
How did you know that?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.659
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.038
You can read minds?

24:56.205 --> 24:59.291
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.461
Everyone is disgusting.

25:04.338 --> 25:06.298
-Could you please stop thinking that?
-Sorry.

25:07.216 --> 25:08.675
-Please, stop.
-Thinking?

25:09.718 --> 25:11.178
-Thinking that.
-I'm trying.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.556
Well, not very hard.
And I think you look weird too.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.225
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.643
I wish my head glowed.

25:18.727 --> 25:19.728
No, no, you don't.

25:19.895 --> 25:22.314
I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay?
And it just came out.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.357
What are you doing here?

25:23.524 --> 25:25.442
-Are you a spy?
-What? No. No, no.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.568
We should torture him.

25:26.735 --> 25:27.653
Guys. No, it's okay.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.531
We're not spies. He's my dad.

25:33.075 --> 25:34.076
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

25:34.493 --> 25:38.205
Then who is San Francisco?

25:38.372 --> 25:39.915
-It's where we're from.
-It's a place.

25:40.082 --> 25:41.041
Then what's Earth?

25:41.208 --> 25:42.042
It's also where we're from.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.210
We should torture them.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.504
Why are you always trying to torture people?
We have other options.

25:45.671 --> 25:48.465
Do things come out of your holes,
like milk, juice...

25:48.632 --> 25:51.093
Veb, stop asking about his holes.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.302
Some of us have holes.

25:52.469 --> 25:53.887
What are you doing here?

25:54.054 --> 25:55.722
Where are you from?

25:56.348 --> 25:57.683
-Okay.
-Up there. Up there.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.811
-See, above this, it's a different universe.
-The Earth. Big Earth.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.063
-It's the same universe, but it's bigger.
-This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.065
-Sometimes, I guess.
-I get big. I shrink.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.109
-And it's like...
-But I wrote a book about it, actually.

26:07.276 --> 26:08.151
-I don't know.
-This is the Quantum Realm.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.528
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.488
-We shrunk. Right now, we're really small.
-It's bigger where we're from.

26:11.655 --> 26:13.448
-So, we're small right now.
-It's bigger.

26:17.119 --> 26:19.246
Okay, they're telling the truth.

26:19.413 --> 26:20.289
It doesn't matter.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.918
You come from above.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.171
Like him.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.300
So, he is hunting you.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.595
He will burn the world to find you.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.513
Who?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.433
The Conqueror.

27:42.246 --> 27:45.916
There are beings down here.
Intelligent beings.

27:46.083 --> 27:49.044
I always theorized it was possible,
but to be here...

27:50.170 --> 27:52.297
a subatomic universe.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.925
This changes everything we know about life...

27:55.092 --> 27:57.511
evolution, our place in the galaxy...

27:57.678 --> 27:59.388
Holy shit!

27:59.888 --> 28:01.431
That guy looks like broccoli.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.150
Keep your head down.

29:04.286 --> 29:05.287
Follow me.

29:18.717 --> 29:19.718
Drink those.

29:20.427 --> 29:21.762
I'll be right back.

29:36.318 --> 29:37.402
I'm here for Krylar.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.367
It's you.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.868
Let's keep that between us.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.496
And Krylar.

29:47.663 --> 29:48.664
Hello.

29:49.873 --> 29:51.625
I don't know your ways or customs...

29:51.792 --> 29:55.337
but I assume that you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

29:55.504 --> 29:56.547
Absolutely, sir.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.927
So, what's your story then?

30:03.387 --> 30:04.388
God.

30:05.931 --> 30:06.932
Move.

30:07.349 --> 30:08.350
It's time.

30:08.892 --> 30:09.893
Follow me.

30:16.650 --> 30:17.860
Right this way.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.868
How exactly do you know this guy?

30:26.034 --> 30:29.204
Old freedom fighter friend of mine.

30:29.371 --> 30:31.373
Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?

30:31.540 --> 30:32.583
Or terrorist.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.793
Depends on who you ask.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.338
But, trust me, he can help.

31:20.339 --> 31:22.966
Janet Van Dyne?

31:24.760 --> 31:26.512
I thought you were dead.

31:27.137 --> 31:29.014
Been a long time, Krylar.

31:29.181 --> 31:32.434
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

31:32.601 --> 31:34.937
I fought like hell against that.

31:35.479 --> 31:37.105
It sounds so elitist.

31:38.190 --> 31:41.026
You have got to be Hank.

31:41.527 --> 31:44.947
I've heard so much about you and your ants.

31:45.113 --> 31:47.282
What are ants anyway?

31:47.449 --> 31:48.825
Do we have 'em down here?

31:48.992 --> 31:50.619
I don't think so. No.

31:51.662 --> 31:52.788
That's too bad.

31:53.997 --> 31:54.998
Hope.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.417
You have to be Hope.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.212
She talked about you every day.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.713
That's strange...

32:02.297 --> 32:04.049
she never said anything about you.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.679
I don't think I would have told
my kid either.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.181
-Wild stuff.
-Funny.

32:12.057 --> 32:12.850
How wild?

32:14.226 --> 32:16.436
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

32:18.105 --> 32:21.108
Krylar, we need your help.

32:21.441 --> 32:25.237
Janet, after all we've been through,
together...

32:25.529 --> 32:26.488
just ask me.

32:26.655 --> 32:28.156
Tell me, how can I help?

32:28.323 --> 32:29.616
But...

32:29.783 --> 32:32.828
is anyone starving? I'm starving.

32:32.995 --> 32:34.121
Boys...

32:34.872 --> 32:35.873
Now.

32:43.881 --> 32:45.257
They don't know anything.

32:45.716 --> 32:48.510
About... anything.

32:48.677 --> 32:49.678
Then get them out of here.

32:51.638 --> 32:52.681
Excuse me.

32:52.848 --> 32:54.975
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

32:55.142 --> 32:56.518
We're just trying to find our family.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.811
Do you have a map?

32:57.978 --> 32:59.229
All we wanna do is go...

33:02.232 --> 33:03.275
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

33:03.442 --> 33:04.568
They're with us.

33:06.486 --> 33:07.863
Is that building alive?

33:08.405 --> 33:09.615
Yours are dead?

33:13.118 --> 33:14.119
Look. Excuse me.

33:14.286 --> 33:15.787
We just wanna go home.

33:19.958 --> 33:22.044
At least you still have a home.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.345
What happened here?

33:31.929 --> 33:34.640
The Conqueror burned our homes.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.059
Our stories.

33:38.018 --> 33:41.313
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.982
Some of us escaped...

33:44.316 --> 33:45.901
found others on the run.

33:46.902 --> 33:48.529
We gathered who we could to fight.

33:49.238 --> 33:50.781
It was never enough.

33:52.074 --> 33:53.283
I'm sorry.

33:54.159 --> 33:55.160
We can help.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.168
-Cassie...
-Dad, you're an Avenger.

34:03.335 --> 34:04.253
They need help.

34:04.419 --> 34:06.338
No. What I need to do is get you home.

34:06.797 --> 34:07.965
Why don't you wanna help?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.341
We don't know anything about this place.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.217
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

34:11.385 --> 34:12.553
Have we been gone for 10 seconds?

34:12.719 --> 34:13.719
Or have we been gone for 10 years?

34:13.887 --> 34:15.013
Think about your mom right now.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.349
-Can you imagine what she must be...
-Don't use Mom as an excuse.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.601
-You just don't care.
-No, I do care.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.436
I know you wanna help. I do.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.397
But this is not our fight.

34:23.772 --> 34:26.440
Just 'cause it's not happening to you
doesn't mean it's not happening.

34:27.943 --> 34:28.944
Hey.

34:31.905 --> 34:33.282
Would you look at me?

34:35.576 --> 34:37.077
She's disappointed in you.

34:37.244 --> 34:38.704
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

34:38.871 --> 34:39.705
You're welcome.

34:39.871 --> 34:40.956
We'll talk about it later.

34:41.123 --> 34:42.791
Right now, let's just find the others.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.210
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

34:47.588 --> 34:48.505
What did you say?

34:49.005 --> 34:50.090
What?

34:50.257 --> 34:51.466
That name.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.136
Janet Van Dyne.

34:54.303 --> 34:55.262
Where is she?

34:55.429 --> 34:57.181
That's what we're trying to find out.
You know her?

34:57.681 --> 34:58.891
I know her.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.476
She shouldn't be here.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.230
Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please.

35:05.898 --> 35:06.940
Yes, thank you.

35:07.107 --> 35:10.194
If you haven't had this, don't try it...

35:10.694 --> 35:12.779
unless you want to change your life.

35:24.082 --> 35:27.586
Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.

35:28.587 --> 35:29.838
Two of them.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.298
Human, like us.

35:31.465 --> 35:33.091
Human, that's the word.

35:33.258 --> 35:36.345
Totally forgot what you call yourselves
up there.

35:36.512 --> 35:37.513
Human.

35:38.180 --> 35:40.182
Are you not human?

35:40.349 --> 35:42.351
Not technically, but yes.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.353
In the ways that matter.

35:48.982 --> 35:49.983
No!

35:53.529 --> 35:54.863
Let us talk.

35:57.824 --> 36:02.079
So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet?

36:03.497 --> 36:05.916
If I remember correctly, you left.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.378
You left all of us.

36:10.045 --> 36:11.255
With him.

36:12.798 --> 36:14.758
Janet, what is he talking about?

36:16.718 --> 36:19.555
You didn't tell them about him.

36:22.516 --> 36:24.101
Did you say anything...

36:25.018 --> 36:26.228
about what you did here?

36:28.564 --> 36:30.732
How many people died because of you?

36:35.779 --> 36:38.156
Does your family even know who you are?

36:41.827 --> 36:42.995
Your mommy...

36:44.454 --> 36:46.290
is full of secrets.

36:46.456 --> 36:47.541
You're lying.

36:47.708 --> 36:48.834
I lie.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.170
A lot.

36:53.839 --> 36:55.591
Not about this.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.677
Let them go.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.472
He just wants me.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.016
But you want them.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.977
So they're coming too.

37:08.228 --> 37:11.273
Along with those other friends of yours.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.526
I heard about them.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.904
But he did too.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.324
And he sent the Hunter.

37:20.866 --> 37:22.492
What kind of hunter?

37:23.744 --> 37:25.871
Not a man. Not a machine.

37:26.038 --> 37:29.917
A mechanized organism designed only...

37:30.083 --> 37:31.793
for killing.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.214
Where are they?

37:35.380 --> 37:36.673
No clue.

37:37.925 --> 37:38.926
Dead.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.513
Probably dead.

37:55.484 --> 37:59.029
This is so sad when all of this...

37:59.196 --> 38:00.739
could have been avoided, Janet.

38:02.241 --> 38:04.034
Just give him what he wants.

38:07.246 --> 38:08.705
What happened to you?

38:11.416 --> 38:14.503
We fought against him.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.465
He can be very persuasive.

38:20.759 --> 38:22.052
Let's pay him a visit.

38:26.139 --> 38:27.516
I think we're done here.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.743
Can that ship get us out of here?

38:49.454 --> 38:50.205
Cover me?

38:50.372 --> 38:51.456
Always.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.489
Henry, take the helm.

39:25.490 --> 39:26.658
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.372
Where are the controls?

39:32.873 --> 39:34.166
Those are the controls.

39:37.836 --> 39:39.004
What the hell?

39:39.171 --> 39:41.048
You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.385
Is the bike alive?

39:58.941 --> 40:00.609
Hands, all the way in!

40:01.610 --> 40:02.736
Like stuffing a turkey.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.829
-Really, him?
-He used to be charming.

40:12.996 --> 40:13.747
That guy?

40:13.914 --> 40:15.749
I was down here for 30 years, Henry.

40:15.916 --> 40:17.626
-I had needs.
-Oh, my God.

40:17.793 --> 40:19.586
Look, I get it. I've got needs too.

40:19.753 --> 40:20.754
Oh, my God!

40:20.921 --> 40:23.006
I had dinner with someone a few times.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.050
Her name was Linda.

40:26.009 --> 40:27.010
It didn't work out.

40:27.177 --> 40:28.428
What went wrong?

40:28.887 --> 40:30.472
She wasn't you, baby.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.770
-Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving.
-All right.

40:36.937 --> 40:38.730
-And, Xolum.
-Right here.

40:38.897 --> 40:41.108
Take them as far away from here as you can.

40:41.275 --> 40:42.317
-Why?
-What?

40:42.484 --> 40:45.654
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

40:54.121 --> 40:55.873
You led them straight to us.

40:56.623 --> 40:57.749
Come on, come on.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.835
Take as many as you can.

41:00.002 --> 41:01.211
We'll hold them off.

41:24.443 --> 41:25.444
Go!

41:27.070 --> 41:28.488
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

41:29.156 --> 41:30.616
We gotta go! We gotta go!

41:30.782 --> 41:31.825
Get on. Get on now!

41:31.992 --> 41:33.243
We have to go now. Now!

41:51.220 --> 41:52.221
Oh, my God!

42:09.988 --> 42:11.323
Cassie, let's go!

42:18.539 --> 42:19.831
Get to the sanctuary.

42:20.582 --> 42:21.667
Wait for my message.

42:21.834 --> 42:24.086
-Veb, we're leaving.
-No. No, wait!

42:24.253 --> 42:26.296
-Move! Move!
-All my friends.

42:48.610 --> 42:49.695
Give up the travelers.

42:49.862 --> 42:51.154
The Conqueror will show you mercy.

42:51.321 --> 42:52.698
I know his mercy.

43:06.336 --> 43:07.421
Stay here. I'm...

43:08.672 --> 43:09.673
Cassie?

43:11.383 --> 43:12.384
Oh, no.

43:35.532 --> 43:37.034
Okay. I have a suit.

43:37.534 --> 43:38.952
Yeah, I noticed.

43:39.661 --> 43:40.996
-You okay?
-Yes.

43:42.664 --> 43:43.999
Look, momentum, right?

43:44.166 --> 43:46.084
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

43:46.251 --> 43:47.336
I know how to do it, Dad.

43:47.503 --> 43:48.504
-Do you? Really?
-Yes.

43:48.670 --> 43:49.838
'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.

43:50.005 --> 43:51.298
I messed up on the timing.

43:51.465 --> 43:52.299
Jump...

43:57.930 --> 43:58.805
Like that.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.390
You see what I did? You see what I did?

44:00.974 --> 44:02.601
No. You're like this small.

44:02.976 --> 44:03.977
I jumped and tapped.

44:14.696 --> 44:16.198
Jentorra, we have to go.

44:37.386 --> 44:38.554
Get to the ship!

45:26.476 --> 45:29.188
Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.

45:29.938 --> 45:32.524
I've been waiting a long time for this.

45:33.233 --> 45:34.318
What?

45:35.861 --> 45:37.029
Is someone in there?

45:37.196 --> 45:39.156
Oh, yes.

45:39.323 --> 45:41.909
The destiny you cannot escape.

45:42.075 --> 45:45.204
Our fates have always been forged together...

45:47.497 --> 45:49.374
ever since that day we met.

45:51.793 --> 45:53.212
Scott Lang.

45:53.378 --> 45:54.463
Get away from us!

45:54.630 --> 45:56.173
The day you broke me.

45:59.343 --> 46:01.220
-Banished me down here.
-Wait.

46:03.555 --> 46:04.556
Darren?

46:06.350 --> 46:07.851
Surprised to see me?

46:09.770 --> 46:10.854
Yeah.

46:11.021 --> 46:12.147
It's the bee guy?

46:12.606 --> 46:14.358
-It's the bee guy?
-Cassie?

46:14.525 --> 46:16.193
I almost didn't recognize you.

46:17.110 --> 46:18.737
How are you not dead?

46:18.904 --> 46:20.822
I became the ultimate weapon.

46:22.074 --> 46:24.159
That's what this is?

46:25.035 --> 46:26.286
Look, Darren.

46:30.457 --> 46:31.708
Darren is dead!

46:32.835 --> 46:35.379
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

46:36.547 --> 46:38.549
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

46:38.715 --> 46:39.842
Not from me.

46:40.467 --> 46:42.094
And not from him.

46:43.136 --> 46:45.305
He's the future.

46:46.056 --> 46:47.182
He's the past.

46:47.933 --> 46:51.228
And now all he needs is you.

46:57.526 --> 46:58.652
Mom?

46:59.111 --> 47:00.821
What's after Scott and Cassie?

47:02.698 --> 47:04.157
We have to find them.

47:05.242 --> 47:06.952
There's something I have to do first.

47:07.119 --> 47:08.537
They could be dead!

47:08.704 --> 47:10.163
Hope, please.

47:10.372 --> 47:11.957
And you're still hiding things from us.

47:12.124 --> 47:14.418
I am trying to protect you.

47:15.002 --> 47:16.003
From what?

47:18.630 --> 47:20.507
Who are you so afraid of?

47:33.061 --> 47:34.438
Third time in jail?

47:36.565 --> 47:37.608
Four.

47:46.408 --> 47:48.410
And here we are again.

47:49.453 --> 47:51.038
Face to face.

47:53.624 --> 47:55.042
That's a face.

47:56.460 --> 47:57.669
It's a big face.

47:57.836 --> 47:59.421
Why are you just a floating head?

47:59.588 --> 48:01.673
Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.

48:01.840 --> 48:04.760
You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.388
But the Conqueror found me.

48:08.555 --> 48:10.098
Rebuilt me.

48:10.265 --> 48:12.309
Made me the ultimate weapon.

48:12.976 --> 48:15.771
A mechanized organism designed
only for...

48:15.938 --> 48:16.939
M.O.D.O.K.?

48:19.024 --> 48:21.360
I get it. It's an acronym.

48:21.527 --> 48:22.694
It's an acronym.

48:22.861 --> 48:25.864
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

48:27.282 --> 48:28.909
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

48:29.076 --> 48:32.496
-I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.
-Just now noticing the baby legs.

48:33.247 --> 48:34.248
They're not baby legs.

48:34.414 --> 48:35.791
A little bit like a Björn.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.292
You think you're so smart.

48:37.626 --> 48:40.587
Scott Lang,
the man who took everything from me.

48:40.754 --> 48:42.172
Who stole my whole life.

48:42.464 --> 48:43.465
But I did it.

48:44.925 --> 48:46.593
I got you here.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.762
I found your signal, Cassie.

48:48.929 --> 48:51.515
Thanks for that, by the way.
Couldn't have done it without you.

48:54.768 --> 48:56.770
You're looking at a man set free.

48:57.771 --> 49:01.441
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

49:02.609 --> 49:05.237
All for him.

49:07.990 --> 49:11.076
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

49:14.454 --> 49:16.164
What is this place?

49:17.457 --> 49:19.334
He said he was a traveler.

49:19.626 --> 49:22.546
A scientist who crashed off course.

49:30.262 --> 49:31.722
He had a ship...

49:32.598 --> 49:35.267
beyond anything I had ever seen.

49:35.851 --> 49:38.979
A ship that could travel the Multiverse.

49:39.146 --> 49:40.355
The Multiverse?

49:41.356 --> 49:43.901
As in alternate dimensions?

49:44.067 --> 49:45.903
Parallel realities?

49:46.069 --> 49:47.696
I didn't believe it at first.

49:49.907 --> 49:50.908
But it's real.

49:52.701 --> 49:54.119
Just like we theorized.

49:56.663 --> 49:58.373
Can this take us home?

50:00.459 --> 50:01.752
It can take you anywhere.

50:20.938 --> 50:22.814
I'd never met anyone like him.

50:25.192 --> 50:27.319
He felt so...

50:27.736 --> 50:28.820
lost.

50:30.489 --> 50:31.740
I guess we both were.

50:32.658 --> 50:34.076
But we had a way out.

50:36.245 --> 50:38.455
We tried everything...

50:38.622 --> 50:41.416
to recharge his ship's energy core.

50:47.005 --> 50:48.590
Nothing worked.

50:50.133 --> 50:54.805
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

50:56.056 --> 50:57.516
I lied to Hope.

51:02.062 --> 51:03.730
I told her I was coming home.

51:07.860 --> 51:09.736
I can see her by the door.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.657
Waiting for me.

51:17.703 --> 51:19.204
That's the last thing I did...

51:21.874 --> 51:23.041
was lie to her.

51:26.879 --> 51:28.881
I just thought I'd have more time.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.179
I can give that to you.

51:37.181 --> 51:38.182
Time.

51:42.102 --> 51:43.437
It's not what you think it is.

51:47.733 --> 51:49.151
It's a cage.

51:50.569 --> 51:52.321
And it does everything it can...

51:52.988 --> 51:54.072
to break you.

51:57.284 --> 52:00.537
It's not until you free yourself from it
that you see...

52:01.705 --> 52:03.123
just how small...

52:04.124 --> 52:05.334
it always was.

52:11.131 --> 52:13.008
We're going to get out of here.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.763
She's gonna open the door...

52:19.348 --> 52:20.807
and you'll be there.

52:25.437 --> 52:26.605
I promise.

52:31.193 --> 52:33.028
-Let's get to work.
-Okay.

52:36.156 --> 52:39.076
It took ages, but we did it.

52:40.661 --> 52:43.038
We brought it back to life.

52:45.165 --> 52:46.667
Let's go home.

52:51.213 --> 52:53.090
His ship was neurokinetic.

52:54.258 --> 52:55.717
Connected to his thoughts.

52:59.638 --> 53:00.722
When I touched it...

53:02.808 --> 53:04.560
I saw his mind.

53:05.686 --> 53:06.687
I felt...

53:08.480 --> 53:09.857
what he had done.

53:13.652 --> 53:15.487
Entire worlds...

53:16.154 --> 53:18.365
entire timelines.

53:18.532 --> 53:22.536
Gone, like they never even existed.

53:40.971 --> 53:41.972
Janet?

53:46.768 --> 53:47.978
We can leave.

53:50.189 --> 53:51.190
Right now.

53:56.195 --> 53:57.821
Who is Kang?

54:03.160 --> 54:04.578
Who I need to be.

54:08.916 --> 54:10.250
He didn't crash here.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.461
He was exiled here.

54:13.545 --> 54:16.715
Outside space and time.

54:17.925 --> 54:19.551
The only place...

54:20.469 --> 54:22.095
that could hold him.

54:23.222 --> 54:24.598
Exiled?

54:25.265 --> 54:26.725
By who?

54:27.100 --> 54:28.101
I don't know.

54:30.604 --> 54:32.397
But they sabotaged his ship.

54:33.690 --> 54:35.442
And trapped him here.

54:37.903 --> 54:39.279
And because of me...

54:40.697 --> 54:42.074
he was getting out.

54:42.241 --> 54:43.075
Janet?

54:46.119 --> 54:47.412
Stay away.

54:53.043 --> 54:54.711
You saved my life.

55:00.050 --> 55:01.385
I made a promise.

55:08.350 --> 55:09.977
Just let me take you home.

55:11.770 --> 55:12.813
And then?

55:14.982 --> 55:16.733
What are you going to do?

55:28.120 --> 55:29.413
Win.

55:47.639 --> 55:51.185
I told you time isn't what you think.

55:53.312 --> 55:54.980
I can make it...

55:55.772 --> 55:57.858
so you never left her.

55:59.193 --> 56:02.404
Hope is going to open the door...

56:03.822 --> 56:05.157
and you'll be there.

56:06.158 --> 56:08.493
And how many worlds will die...

56:09.953 --> 56:11.580
if you get out?

56:12.915 --> 56:14.166
Not yours.

56:15.918 --> 56:17.544
She'll never know.

56:22.299 --> 56:24.843
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

56:27.179 --> 56:28.722
I can't let you leave.

56:31.183 --> 56:33.185
Why do you think you can stop me?

56:51.161 --> 56:52.538
Give it to me, Janet.

56:53.997 --> 56:55.123
Give it to me!

56:55.582 --> 56:58.544
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

56:59.419 --> 57:00.420
What did you do?

57:04.925 --> 57:06.426
I'm sorry, Hope.

57:08.804 --> 57:09.972
No!

57:37.207 --> 57:38.917
I blew up his core.

57:39.126 --> 57:41.295
Cut him off from time.

57:41.712 --> 57:44.631
And trapped us both down here forever.

57:46.675 --> 57:48.594
But I gave him back enough.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.387
Now that he had his suit back...

57:50.554 --> 57:53.932
he became what he always was.

57:54.850 --> 57:56.518
A conqueror.

57:56.685 --> 57:59.271
He's got weapons and technology...

57:59.438 --> 58:03.108
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

58:03.942 --> 58:07.738
He took his prison and made it his empire.

58:08.780 --> 58:12.034
I spent years fighting him...

58:12.201 --> 58:14.786
running from him, hiding from him.

58:16.496 --> 58:17.915
And then you saved me.

58:21.251 --> 58:22.252
You brought me home.

58:24.171 --> 58:25.214
But I didn't deserve it.

58:27.007 --> 58:30.594
I unleashed a monster on this place...

58:30.761 --> 58:32.596
and ran away.

58:33.013 --> 58:36.433
Janet, you couldn't have known.

58:38.602 --> 58:40.562
I'm sorry I never told you.

58:41.647 --> 58:43.524
I just wanted to forget.

58:45.025 --> 58:47.361
I just wanted to be your mom again.

58:52.741 --> 58:55.702
I'm so sorry you had to go through
all of that alone.

58:56.662 --> 58:59.289
But you are not alone now.

59:02.960 --> 59:04.378
We'll stop him together.

59:05.420 --> 59:06.880
He's after the core.

59:07.965 --> 59:10.384
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

59:10.551 --> 59:13.929
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

59:14.096 --> 59:15.931
-And a head start.
-Exactly.

59:16.098 --> 59:17.724
-We gotta get out of here.
-Hope.

59:18.225 --> 59:19.893
He cannot get out.

59:41.415 --> 59:42.916
You're an interesting man...

59:46.587 --> 59:48.005
Scott Lang.

59:49.673 --> 59:50.883
I don't know who you are...

59:52.259 --> 59:53.844
but you've made a big mistake.

59:54.469 --> 59:55.512
Okay?

59:56.471 --> 59:57.973
I'm an Avenger.

59:58.807 --> 1:00:00.184
I've called the other Avengers...

1:00:00.642 --> 1:00:01.894
You're an Avenger?

1:00:04.188 --> 1:00:06.064
Have I killed you before?

1:00:07.024 --> 1:00:08.025
What?

1:00:08.859 --> 1:00:10.777
They all blur together after a while.

1:00:13.238 --> 1:00:14.656
You're not the one with the hammer?

1:00:14.823 --> 1:00:16.158
No, that's Thor.

1:00:18.118 --> 1:00:19.119
We get confused a lot.

1:00:19.286 --> 1:00:21.496
Similar body types.
Who are you?

1:00:23.916 --> 1:00:25.042
Just a man...

1:00:25.834 --> 1:00:27.711
who's lost a lot of time.

1:00:27.878 --> 1:00:29.046
Like you.

1:00:31.423 --> 1:00:33.425
But we can help each other with that.

1:00:35.219 --> 1:00:37.429
M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief.

1:00:37.596 --> 1:00:39.890
Yeah, he stole something from me.

1:00:41.558 --> 1:00:43.894
Do not speak when I am in the room.

1:00:51.818 --> 1:00:54.279
Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

1:00:54.988 --> 1:00:56.323
You know Janet too?

1:00:57.616 --> 1:00:59.785
Does everyone down here know Janet?

1:01:01.078 --> 1:01:02.704
She didn't tell you about me?

1:01:07.292 --> 1:01:08.961
I guess that's not a surprise.

1:01:11.588 --> 1:01:13.674
Janet stole something from me.

1:01:14.591 --> 1:01:17.219
My ticket out of here.

1:01:19.930 --> 1:01:22.850
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

1:01:23.225 --> 1:01:24.768
And why would I do that?

1:01:24.935 --> 1:01:27.437
Because you want to get out of here.

1:01:28.105 --> 1:01:32.192
And I need to get out of here.

1:01:34.528 --> 1:01:36.363
Because I know how it ends.

1:01:36.822 --> 1:01:38.240
How what ends?

1:01:41.535 --> 1:01:42.953
All of it.

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:49.501
I don't live in a straight line.

1:01:52.254 --> 1:01:53.797
And with time...

1:01:54.756 --> 1:01:55.883
it's hard...

1:01:56.341 --> 1:01:58.051
not to skip to the end.

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:02.014
So, if you want to stop what's coming...

1:02:02.848 --> 1:02:05.058
and trust me...

1:02:05.225 --> 1:02:06.476
you do...

1:02:08.770 --> 1:02:10.898
I am the only shot you have.

1:02:11.607 --> 1:02:12.733
What's coming?

1:02:14.943 --> 1:02:15.861
Me.

1:02:17.863 --> 1:02:20.407
A lot of me.

1:02:24.578 --> 1:02:28.415
They exiled me, down here.

1:02:31.668 --> 1:02:33.337
They're afraid of me.

1:02:39.301 --> 1:02:42.513
But I'm the man who can get you home.

1:02:52.898 --> 1:02:54.399
So, do we have a deal?

1:02:57.778 --> 1:02:59.696
No, I don't think we do.

1:03:09.206 --> 1:03:10.040
Dad!

1:03:10.207 --> 1:03:12.501
Let me make this easy for you.

1:03:12.668 --> 1:03:14.378
You will bring me what I need...

1:03:14.545 --> 1:03:16.839
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you...

1:03:17.005 --> 1:03:19.091
then make you relive that moment...

1:03:19.258 --> 1:03:22.553
over and over again in time, endlessly...

1:03:22.719 --> 1:03:25.180
until you beg me to kill you.

1:03:26.431 --> 1:03:27.850
Do we understand?

1:03:31.603 --> 1:03:32.604
Don't do this.

1:03:36.275 --> 1:03:38.652
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

1:03:41.905 --> 1:03:42.906
Dad.

1:03:44.074 --> 1:03:45.033
Don't listen to him.

1:03:47.828 --> 1:03:48.662
No! No!

1:03:48.829 --> 1:03:49.872
Look, we can talk about this.

1:03:50.330 --> 1:03:51.456
Don't do it!

1:03:51.623 --> 1:03:53.083
You really should do it.

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:54.251
Please.

1:03:55.961 --> 1:03:58.130
That's my daughter, please.

1:03:58.297 --> 1:04:00.757
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:01.925
Please!

1:04:02.092 --> 1:04:03.343
You think I'm lying?

1:04:04.469 --> 1:04:06.180
Do I look like a liar to you?

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:08.932
Stop!

1:04:09.099 --> 1:04:10.601
-Dad!
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

1:04:10.767 --> 1:04:12.311
I'll do it. Just let her go.

1:04:12.477 --> 1:04:14.021
Let her go. Let her go!

1:04:24.948 --> 1:04:26.200
You're out of your league.

1:04:28.243 --> 1:04:29.244
Ant-Man.

1:04:35.501 --> 1:04:37.294
Just be glad I need you.

1:04:50.557 --> 1:04:53.977
Don't touch her again.

1:04:54.436 --> 1:04:56.021
Then give me what I need.

1:04:57.773 --> 1:04:59.024
Where is it?

1:05:40.566 --> 1:05:41.984
What is that?

1:05:42.150 --> 1:05:44.528
It was a multiversal engine core.

1:05:46.196 --> 1:05:49.658
A power source that can take you anywhere
in space and time.

1:05:51.410 --> 1:05:52.995
Then Janet blew it up.

1:05:57.332 --> 1:05:58.667
It's in that?

1:05:58.834 --> 1:06:00.711
It is that.

1:06:00.878 --> 1:06:02.921
And we have to get to the center.

1:06:03.755 --> 1:06:05.174
That's good to know.

1:06:07.009 --> 1:06:10.220
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

1:06:10.387 --> 1:06:13.015
Once you're inside, find the core...

1:06:13.182 --> 1:06:14.892
and size it back down.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.518
What does it look like?

1:06:16.685 --> 1:06:18.896
When I steal something,
I usually know what I'm stealing.

1:06:19.062 --> 1:06:20.689
You'll know it when you see it.

1:06:20.856 --> 1:06:23.150
Get in and out as fast as you can.

1:06:23.317 --> 1:06:26.612
The longer you're in there,
the more your mind will come undone.

1:06:29.531 --> 1:06:30.532
Better hurry.

1:06:31.742 --> 1:06:32.701
Dad!

1:06:35.204 --> 1:06:36.538
I'm sorry.

1:06:36.997 --> 1:06:38.540
This is all my fault.

1:06:39.958 --> 1:06:41.835
Hey, hey, hey.

1:06:42.211 --> 1:06:43.212
No.

1:06:44.838 --> 1:06:46.048
I messed up.

1:06:46.715 --> 1:06:47.549
Cassie.

1:06:48.509 --> 1:06:50.719
My whole life happened because I messed up.

1:06:52.179 --> 1:06:54.806
The only thing I didn't mess up is you.

1:06:58.018 --> 1:06:59.186
Dad!

1:06:59.895 --> 1:07:00.854
It's okay.

1:07:01.021 --> 1:07:02.147
It's okay.

1:07:04.900 --> 1:07:06.360
I love you, Peanut.

1:07:07.569 --> 1:07:09.404
I love you too.

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:55.158
Okay. I'm in.

1:07:58.453 --> 1:08:00.455
Darren, can you hear me?

1:08:00.622 --> 1:08:01.540
Darren?

1:08:02.749 --> 1:08:03.750
Darren?

1:08:06.211 --> 1:08:08.005
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

1:08:08.172 --> 1:08:09.256
What?

1:08:09.631 --> 1:08:11.216
-I'm in.
-Okay.

1:08:11.717 --> 1:08:14.469
Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?

1:08:15.971 --> 1:08:17.139
Don't die?

1:08:18.390 --> 1:08:20.767
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

1:08:20.934 --> 1:08:22.102
Do you see it?

1:08:23.562 --> 1:08:24.729
Yeah. I see it.

1:08:29.943 --> 1:08:31.361
I'm heading in.

1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:35.657
What the hell?

1:08:35.823 --> 1:08:36.700
What the hell?

1:08:36.867 --> 1:08:37.701
What the hell?

1:08:37.868 --> 1:08:40.578
I told you, Scott.
Getting in was just the beginning.

1:08:40.746 --> 1:08:41.872
You never said that.

1:08:42.038 --> 1:08:43.290
Why am I looking at another me?

1:08:43.457 --> 1:08:45.000
I'm not another me. You're another me.

1:08:45.167 --> 1:08:46.084
You just came out...

1:08:46.251 --> 1:08:47.877
Why am I looking at another me?

1:08:48.045 --> 1:08:51.215
You're looking at the possibility
of another you.

1:08:51.381 --> 1:08:53.133
You're in a Probability Storm.

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:55.426
What does any of that mean?

1:08:55.594 --> 1:08:57.261
-You don't know?
-Why would I know?

1:08:57.429 --> 1:08:58.346
Because you got me in here.

1:08:58.514 --> 1:08:59.723
So, I am the real one, huh?

1:08:59.890 --> 1:09:00.807
No. I didn't say that.

1:09:02.350 --> 1:09:03.602
-What the hell?

1:09:03.769 --> 1:09:04.685
-What the hell?

1:09:04.853 --> 1:09:05.895
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-What the hell?

1:09:06.063 --> 1:09:07.104
What the hell?

1:09:08.232 --> 1:09:09.191
What is this place?

1:09:09.358 --> 1:09:11.443
It's a Probability Storm.

1:09:11.944 --> 1:09:14.446
Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.

1:09:14.613 --> 1:09:16.031
What is he saying? What's he saying?

1:09:16.406 --> 1:09:18.617
-What's he saying?
-You're inside Schrödinger's box.

1:09:18.783 --> 1:09:19.785
And you're the cat.

1:09:19.952 --> 1:09:21.411
-That doesn't make sense.
-Oh, I get it.

1:09:21.578 --> 1:09:23.287
Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!

1:09:23.455 --> 1:09:25.582
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1:09:25.749 --> 1:09:26.792
-What the hell?
-Am I real?

1:09:26.959 --> 1:09:27.835
-Am I real?

1:09:28.001 --> 1:09:29.294
-I am the real one!
-What the hell?

1:09:29.461 --> 1:09:31.380
What the hell. I'm the real one.

1:09:31.546 --> 1:09:33.048
Guys. Hey, relax.

1:09:33.215 --> 1:09:34.883
Take it easy. Breathe.

1:09:35.050 --> 1:09:37.135
We'll figure this out. Together.

1:09:37.301 --> 1:09:38.303
Who are you?

1:09:38.470 --> 1:09:39.846
Why are you dressed like that?

1:09:40.805 --> 1:09:42.307
Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.

1:09:42.474 --> 1:09:44.225
This is my uniform.

1:09:44.393 --> 1:09:45.685
These are normal clothes.

1:09:45.853 --> 1:09:47.145
Why are you dressed like that?

1:09:47.229 --> 1:09:48.772
-Do you have ice cream?
-Enough!

1:09:48.939 --> 1:09:49.982
Let's do this!

1:09:58.156 --> 1:09:59.658
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1:10:02.035 --> 1:10:03.036
Wait.

1:10:03.662 --> 1:10:04.872
Wait. Wait!

1:10:05.038 --> 1:10:06.123
No! No!

1:10:06.665 --> 1:10:08.750
No! Wait! No!

1:10:08.917 --> 1:10:10.252
I've got a read on Scott.

1:10:25.893 --> 1:10:26.852
Out of the way!

1:10:27.019 --> 1:10:29.104
-Mom! What is this?
-What are you doing?

1:10:29.271 --> 1:10:31.023
Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.

1:10:32.316 --> 1:10:33.609
They're not you.

1:10:33.942 --> 1:10:35.903
Scott, where are you?

1:10:40.157 --> 1:10:41.158
Why am I here?

1:10:42.159 --> 1:10:43.994
Don't worry. It'll work this time.

1:10:44.161 --> 1:10:45.954
What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1:10:46.121 --> 1:10:48.624
-Stop! No!
-I got this, guys.

1:10:54.004 --> 1:10:56.006
I got this!
I got it!

1:11:00.427 --> 1:11:01.637
Scott, where are you?

1:11:02.221 --> 1:11:03.222
Scott!

1:11:06.683 --> 1:11:08.268
Where are you, Scott?

1:11:09.603 --> 1:11:11.438
-I can't breathe.
-Ow, that's my neck.

1:11:13.023 --> 1:11:14.149
Stop kicking me!

1:11:16.818 --> 1:11:18.403
-My back!
-We're all gonna die!

1:11:19.571 --> 1:11:20.572
Dad.

1:11:23.408 --> 1:11:24.660
Come back.

1:11:25.410 --> 1:11:26.578
Dad...

1:11:27.371 --> 1:11:28.789
if you can hear me...

1:11:29.373 --> 1:11:31.875
come back.
Just come back.

1:11:32.918 --> 1:11:34.461
-Don't give up.
-Come on.

1:11:35.337 --> 1:11:37.256
-Dad, just come back one more time.
-Come on.

1:11:37.422 --> 1:11:39.007
-She needs us.
-Please.

1:11:39.174 --> 1:11:40.759
-Yes, come on.
-Come back.

1:11:40.843 --> 1:11:42.803
She needs us.
Let's do it together.

1:11:42.886 --> 1:11:45.013
-Get him up! Get him up!
-Grab him! Grab him!

1:11:45.097 --> 1:11:46.306
Let's go.

1:11:47.224 --> 1:11:49.226
-Come on, lift him!
-Yes!

1:11:49.393 --> 1:11:51.603
-I got ya, I got ya! Go.
-Come on. That's it.

1:11:51.770 --> 1:11:53.605
-Come on!
-Give him a boost! Give him a boost!

1:11:55.816 --> 1:11:58.318
Come on, we're doing it for Cassie!
Fellas, let's go!

1:11:58.485 --> 1:12:00.195
Everyone together!

1:12:00.362 --> 1:12:01.405
What are you doing?

1:12:02.155 --> 1:12:03.699
How are you able to do that?

1:12:03.866 --> 1:12:04.867
I'll tell you how.

1:12:06.451 --> 1:12:08.120
We all want the same thing.

1:12:10.038 --> 1:12:11.748
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1:12:20.382 --> 1:12:21.758
Go get her, pal.

1:12:27.139 --> 1:12:28.682
Everyone, let's go!

1:12:31.059 --> 1:12:32.311
Come on!

1:12:40.277 --> 1:12:41.278
Come on, closer.

1:12:41.445 --> 1:12:42.321
Get him higher!

1:12:42.487 --> 1:12:44.156
Hang on, guys, hang on.

1:12:45.449 --> 1:12:46.992
Careful. Steady, steady.

1:12:50.037 --> 1:12:51.830
Steady. That's it.

1:12:51.997 --> 1:12:52.998
Let's go.

1:12:59.379 --> 1:13:00.380
What?

1:13:03.926 --> 1:13:05.552
-Oh no.
-What happened? Did it work?

1:13:05.719 --> 1:13:07.429
Sorry, buddy!

1:13:07.596 --> 1:13:09.348
-No, no, no.

1:13:19.441 --> 1:13:21.443
Hope, are you real?

1:13:21.985 --> 1:13:23.278
I'm real.

1:13:23.904 --> 1:13:24.905
Then let's do this.

1:13:29.910 --> 1:13:31.203
You ready?

1:13:31.370 --> 1:13:32.371
Ready.

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:19.459
Come on.

1:14:19.626 --> 1:14:20.711
We gotta get that thing out of here.

1:14:20.878 --> 1:14:21.712
No, no, no. Wait.

1:14:21.879 --> 1:14:22.963
He's got Cassie.

1:14:23.505 --> 1:14:24.756
-What?
-Scott.

1:14:25.299 --> 1:14:27.384
-Janet.
-Give that to me.

1:14:27.551 --> 1:14:28.427
-We have to go now.
-No.

1:14:28.594 --> 1:14:29.803
He's got Cassie.

1:14:30.179 --> 1:14:32.639
We will save her. I promise you
we will save her...

1:14:34.141 --> 1:14:36.018
but you cannot give that to him.

1:14:36.435 --> 1:14:37.644
I wouldn't trust her.

1:14:41.565 --> 1:14:43.358
Janet has a way of...

1:14:46.445 --> 1:14:47.863
changing her mind.

1:14:54.703 --> 1:14:57.206
Hello, Jellybean.

1:15:03.378 --> 1:15:04.463
So...

1:15:08.258 --> 1:15:09.885
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1:15:13.472 --> 1:15:15.724
Well, well.

1:15:16.892 --> 1:15:19.728
If it isn't my old mentor.

1:15:24.274 --> 1:15:25.108
Hi, Hank.

1:15:28.695 --> 1:15:29.696
Darren?

1:15:30.364 --> 1:15:32.783
Didn't expect to see
your protégé again after all...

1:15:32.950 --> 1:15:34.660
Holy shit, Darren.

1:15:35.619 --> 1:15:36.954
What happened to you?

1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:39.581
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1:15:50.217 --> 1:15:51.844
Do I need to take it?

1:15:52.302 --> 1:15:53.470
Where is my daughter?

1:15:55.556 --> 1:15:56.557
Scott.

1:15:57.891 --> 1:15:58.892
Don't.

1:15:59.810 --> 1:16:02.020
We had a deal.

1:16:02.646 --> 1:16:04.022
She'll be fine without you.

1:16:29.548 --> 1:16:31.175
So long, Hank.

1:16:38.724 --> 1:16:39.725
Henry.

1:16:46.899 --> 1:16:49.193
You left me right here to die.

1:16:53.363 --> 1:16:54.823
Let's see how they do.

1:17:55.634 --> 1:17:57.094
What did you see?

1:18:05.853 --> 1:18:09.189
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1:18:11.191 --> 1:18:12.317
But I always wondered.

1:18:16.113 --> 1:18:18.031
When you touched my mind...

1:18:29.501 --> 1:18:31.211
what did you see?

1:18:32.045 --> 1:18:33.297
A monster...

1:18:34.756 --> 1:18:36.216
who thinks he's a god.

1:18:36.633 --> 1:18:39.052
When you can see time the way I do...

1:18:39.219 --> 1:18:41.138
you don't get to close your eyes.

1:18:41.305 --> 1:18:44.016
And you're the only one who sees?

1:18:44.183 --> 1:18:48.896
I am the only one that can see it's broken.

1:18:49.188 --> 1:18:50.355
And who broke it?

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:54.026
I did.

1:18:55.235 --> 1:18:58.238
Every version of me.

1:18:59.406 --> 1:19:00.866
My variants.

1:19:01.575 --> 1:19:02.951
Throughout the Multiverse.

1:19:05.245 --> 1:19:08.457
Playing with time, like children.

1:19:10.834 --> 1:19:13.879
But I saw how it ends.

1:19:15.172 --> 1:19:17.174
I saw their chaos...

1:19:17.966 --> 1:19:20.928
spreading across realities.

1:19:22.095 --> 1:19:24.348
Universes colliding.

1:19:25.807 --> 1:19:27.059
Endless incursions.

1:19:28.393 --> 1:19:30.354
I saw the Multiverse.

1:19:31.522 --> 1:19:32.940
And it was dying.

1:19:34.650 --> 1:19:35.984
All because of them.

1:19:37.486 --> 1:19:39.321
So, I took control.

1:19:40.030 --> 1:19:41.865
You mean you started a war.

1:19:42.699 --> 1:19:45.953
And now you wanna wipe away
any universe that's a threat to you.

1:19:47.079 --> 1:19:48.705
That's what monsters do.

1:19:48.872 --> 1:19:51.708
That's what conquerors do.

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:54.962
They burn the broken world.

1:19:55.963 --> 1:19:58.757
And they make a new one.

1:19:58.924 --> 1:20:01.802
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1:20:03.929 --> 1:20:06.265
You only want revenge because they beat you.

1:20:07.182 --> 1:20:08.141
Because you lost.

1:20:08.517 --> 1:20:10.352
I have lost.

1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:16.149
You have no idea what I have lost.

1:20:17.693 --> 1:20:21.572
And I will burn them out of time...

1:20:21.738 --> 1:20:23.156
for what they've done to me.

1:20:24.116 --> 1:20:28.078
You'll be wiping out entire timelines.

1:20:28.787 --> 1:20:31.915
Murdering trillions of people.

1:20:33.333 --> 1:20:35.836
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1:20:57.816 --> 1:20:59.276
Oh, God. What am I doing?

1:21:10.078 --> 1:21:11.246
What?

1:21:15.459 --> 1:21:16.376
Hank!

1:21:20.088 --> 1:21:21.381
Are these your ants?

1:21:22.049 --> 1:21:23.133
From the ant farm?

1:21:23.300 --> 1:21:25.177
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1:21:25.552 --> 1:21:26.970
How did you find them down here?

1:21:28.555 --> 1:21:31.141
I've been picking up strange signals
ever since we crashed.

1:21:33.310 --> 1:21:35.938
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.

1:21:36.104 --> 1:21:37.689
Some kind of interference.

1:21:37.856 --> 1:21:39.733
What is that?

1:21:39.900 --> 1:21:41.026
But it wasn't.

1:21:42.402 --> 1:21:43.612
It was the ants.

1:21:45.572 --> 1:21:48.450
They were reaching out the whole time.

1:21:49.910 --> 1:21:53.372
Apparently, they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

1:21:53.956 --> 1:21:56.750
They've lived thousands of years
in a single day...

1:21:57.334 --> 1:22:00.337
expanding their knowledge,
their science...

1:22:00.629 --> 1:22:03.507
becoming more advanced
than I could have ever thought.

1:22:03.841 --> 1:22:05.259
I didn't find them.

1:22:06.134 --> 1:22:07.386
They found me.

1:22:09.471 --> 1:22:11.098
I told you they were smart.

1:22:13.559 --> 1:22:18.564
They've already built something
of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.

1:22:18.856 --> 1:22:21.733
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...

1:22:21.900 --> 1:22:24.778
-but we could learn a lot from these...
-Dad.

1:22:25.863 --> 1:22:27.155
Yeah, they're my ants.

1:22:27.906 --> 1:22:29.908
And ants don't give up.

1:22:30.075 --> 1:22:31.326
I don't care who this guy is.

1:22:31.493 --> 1:22:32.703
I don't care what he can do.

1:22:32.870 --> 1:22:33.912
I'm getting Cassie.

1:22:34.246 --> 1:22:36.498
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1:22:39.626 --> 1:22:41.044
We've got some ideas.

1:22:41.211 --> 1:22:42.212
What are you thinking?

1:22:42.379 --> 1:22:45.382
Well, as a great writer once said...

1:22:46.341 --> 1:22:48.594
"There's always room to grow."

1:22:50.971 --> 1:22:52.055
You read my book?

1:22:52.764 --> 1:22:56.143
Every goddamn word.

1:22:58.770 --> 1:23:00.147
Come on. Let's go to work.

1:23:13.076 --> 1:23:14.912
Hey! I'm sorry.

1:23:15.078 --> 1:23:16.914
That was probably terrifying.

1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:18.373
What are you doing here?

1:23:19.082 --> 1:23:20.250
I'm rescuing you.

1:23:20.626 --> 1:23:21.627
How?

1:23:23.212 --> 1:23:24.838
That's a good question.

1:23:25.464 --> 1:23:28.133
Does this thing have like a key?

1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:30.302
Or a card? Like a room key?

1:23:30.469 --> 1:23:31.678
Do you know, like a...

1:23:33.639 --> 1:23:34.640
Shit!

1:23:42.356 --> 1:23:43.357
Jump and tap.

1:23:52.366 --> 1:23:53.408
Jentorra.

1:23:54.826 --> 1:23:56.620
I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1:23:58.330 --> 1:23:59.331
How can I help?

1:24:04.503 --> 1:24:05.546
Wow.

1:24:05.712 --> 1:24:06.880
Let's hurt 'em back.

1:24:08.090 --> 1:24:09.299
Damn, you're cool.

1:24:10.217 --> 1:24:11.176
Do you have a plan?

1:24:11.343 --> 1:24:12.594
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:14.805
Do you have a plan?

1:24:14.972 --> 1:24:17.015
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1:24:17.683 --> 1:24:19.351
Then free our people
from the detention cells below...

1:24:19.518 --> 1:24:20.769
and launch a counteroffensive from within.

1:24:20.936 --> 1:24:23.105
Yeah, you have a plan.
So, how do we get a message out?

1:24:23.272 --> 1:24:24.231
Follow me.

1:24:24.398 --> 1:24:25.899
Okay. Great.

1:24:30.279 --> 1:24:33.156
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1:24:35.617 --> 1:24:37.160
And I'm taking it with me.

1:24:53.302 --> 1:24:56.054
You really should've let me out
when you had the chance.

1:25:05.314 --> 1:25:08.442
History is not written.

1:25:10.444 --> 1:25:11.695
It is forged.

1:25:12.487 --> 1:25:14.323
Today, we ascend.

1:25:15.199 --> 1:25:20.204
From this fortress, I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.

1:25:21.663 --> 1:25:25.042
Today we conquer eternity.

1:25:25.834 --> 1:25:28.003
And the dynasty of Kang shall...

1:25:31.965 --> 1:25:33.634
Hello? Is this working?

1:25:34.218 --> 1:25:35.219
Cassie?

1:25:35.385 --> 1:25:37.262
I can't tell if this is working.

1:25:38.639 --> 1:25:40.140
Okay. I think we're on.

1:25:40.307 --> 1:25:41.725
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1:25:41.892 --> 1:25:43.560
I thought you were getting the message out.

1:25:45.229 --> 1:25:46.063
Now!

1:25:47.564 --> 1:25:49.733
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:50.901
And I'm with Jentorra.

1:25:51.068 --> 1:25:52.486
He's not invincible.

1:25:58.700 --> 1:26:00.661
I know it might feel like...

1:26:00.827 --> 1:26:02.204
it's too late...

1:26:03.830 --> 1:26:05.916
like all we do is just lose.

1:26:06.458 --> 1:26:08.043
But the family I've lost...

1:26:08.669 --> 1:26:10.295
taught me to keep fighting.

1:26:10.462 --> 1:26:12.339
And if they were here, they would too.

1:26:13.173 --> 1:26:15.175
We need to look out for the little guy.

1:26:15.717 --> 1:26:17.135
My dad taught me that.

1:26:17.594 --> 1:26:19.346
'Cause when people needed help...

1:26:19.930 --> 1:26:21.765
he didn't look the other way.

1:26:22.266 --> 1:26:23.475
And neither do we.

1:26:25.811 --> 1:26:26.770
We need to move!

1:26:26.937 --> 1:26:29.273
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1:26:29.439 --> 1:26:31.817
I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.

1:26:31.984 --> 1:26:34.152
He knows he can't take all of us.

1:26:34.319 --> 1:26:35.445
Come to the...

1:26:35.612 --> 1:26:36.613
Cassie.

1:26:36.780 --> 1:26:38.740
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1:26:38.907 --> 1:26:40.534
-Let's go.
-I'll drive.

1:26:46.623 --> 1:26:48.000
Find Lang's daughter.

1:26:51.336 --> 1:26:52.379
Kill her.

1:27:11.481 --> 1:27:12.524
Let's go. Let's go!

1:27:13.108 --> 1:27:14.359
If you want to fight, follow me!

1:27:19.198 --> 1:27:20.407
It's over, Cassie.

1:27:20.824 --> 1:27:22.534
Free the others. Go!

1:27:30.667 --> 1:27:31.752
He's gonna see us coming.

1:27:31.919 --> 1:27:33.962
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:36.048
Begin the launch.

1:28:28.392 --> 1:28:30.227
Your dad's not here, Cassie...

1:28:30.394 --> 1:28:32.396
but I guess that's not a big surprise.

1:28:55.836 --> 1:28:57.045
Kang!

1:28:58.213 --> 1:29:00.048
We had a deal.

1:29:02.176 --> 1:29:04.469
You took my daughter!

1:29:06.889 --> 1:29:08.265
Holy shit.

1:29:08.932 --> 1:29:10.100
That's big.

1:29:18.859 --> 1:29:20.485
You lied to me!

1:29:21.778 --> 1:29:23.906
Our word is our bond.

1:29:24.698 --> 1:29:27.868
Without that, we're nothing!

1:29:28.660 --> 1:29:29.661
Bring him down.

1:29:29.828 --> 1:29:30.704
Yes, sir.

1:29:37.461 --> 1:29:38.837
Keep going. I've got them.

1:29:40.756 --> 1:29:42.090
Yeah, come on!

1:29:56.605 --> 1:29:57.814
There's so many!

1:29:57.981 --> 1:30:00.234
Scott! I can't hold them!

1:30:11.328 --> 1:30:12.371
They came.

1:30:14.122 --> 1:30:16.124
Way to go, Cassie!

1:30:18.544 --> 1:30:19.628
Yes!

1:30:19.962 --> 1:30:22.381
Come on! Let's go!

1:30:27.386 --> 1:30:29.263
Revolution!

1:30:42.442 --> 1:30:44.486
Burn it all down.

1:30:44.653 --> 1:30:45.863
Fight!

1:31:03.088 --> 1:31:04.965
Cover! Get down!

1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:15.142
What is the bridge code?

1:31:15.684 --> 1:31:16.810
I'll die first.

1:31:17.436 --> 1:31:18.645
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1:31:19.104 --> 1:31:19.980
Damn!

1:31:35.412 --> 1:31:36.580
You'll need this.

1:31:39.041 --> 1:31:39.791
Hi.

1:31:40.709 --> 1:31:41.668
This is our home!

1:31:42.669 --> 1:31:44.046
Let's take it back!

1:31:48.550 --> 1:31:49.551
No!

1:31:56.850 --> 1:31:58.810
I have holes.

1:32:00.604 --> 1:32:03.232
I have holes!

1:32:09.905 --> 1:32:11.240
I didn't know he could do that.

1:32:20.958 --> 1:32:21.959
Kang!

1:32:22.543 --> 1:32:23.836
Where is she?

1:32:24.503 --> 1:32:25.754
Launch now!

1:32:37.015 --> 1:32:38.517
What is that?

1:32:38.892 --> 1:32:40.352
He's getting out.

1:32:40.727 --> 1:32:41.937
Oh, no, he's not.

1:32:49.611 --> 1:32:51.154
Keep him away from the rings.

1:33:30.402 --> 1:33:31.486
Dad!

1:33:34.281 --> 1:33:35.616
Dad, I'm coming!

1:33:47.169 --> 1:33:48.170
Dad!

1:33:56.512 --> 1:33:58.013
Nowhere left to run.

1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:08.106
Please let this work.

1:34:26.542 --> 1:34:28.043
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1:34:28.210 --> 1:34:29.169
Let's go.

1:34:29.545 --> 1:34:31.296
You think this is over? Come on! Let's go.

1:34:31.463 --> 1:34:33.048
Darren, just stop...

1:34:33.465 --> 1:34:35.843
trying to be whatever this is.

1:34:36.635 --> 1:34:38.136
I don't know what to be.

1:34:40.222 --> 1:34:41.723
Tell me what to be.

1:34:42.015 --> 1:34:44.184
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1:34:44.893 --> 1:34:46.353
It's too late.

1:34:46.895 --> 1:34:48.105
Look at me.

1:34:49.690 --> 1:34:51.233
I'm such a dick.

1:34:51.650 --> 1:34:54.069
It's never too late to stop being a dick.

1:34:59.783 --> 1:35:00.951
We've gotta stop him.

1:35:02.786 --> 1:35:04.162
I have an idea.

1:35:06.874 --> 1:35:07.708
Ready?

1:35:07.875 --> 1:35:09.042
Probably not.

1:35:11.837 --> 1:35:14.298
One, two, three. Now!

1:35:37.321 --> 1:35:38.655
Dad!

1:35:38.947 --> 1:35:39.907
Dad!

1:35:40.741 --> 1:35:41.742
Cassie?

1:35:43.744 --> 1:35:44.620
You're huge.

1:35:44.786 --> 1:35:46.413
I'm huge.

1:35:50.834 --> 1:35:52.419
I love you, Peanut.

1:35:52.586 --> 1:35:53.921
I love you too.

1:35:54.296 --> 1:35:55.881
I'm so proud of you.

1:35:56.632 --> 1:35:58.675
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1:35:58.842 --> 1:36:01.428
I know. It feels so cool.

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:03.388
I know, right?

1:36:04.139 --> 1:36:05.265
I'm so hungry.

1:36:05.432 --> 1:36:06.433
Yeah, that happens.

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.769
-I could eat everything.
-Everything. I know.

1:36:09.311 --> 1:36:11.647
-But I really want like a lime.
-Right?

1:36:11.813 --> 1:36:13.857
-Citrus. It's weird. I know.
-Citrus.

1:36:14.024 --> 1:36:15.025
It's...

1:36:25.869 --> 1:36:27.329
Take the tower!

1:36:58.944 --> 1:37:00.195
It's over.

1:37:02.114 --> 1:37:04.116
You still can't see it.

1:37:06.118 --> 1:37:08.996
It's never over.

1:38:25.739 --> 1:38:27.491
-We have to go, right now.
-No.

1:38:27.658 --> 1:38:28.659
-Come on.
-No!

1:38:28.825 --> 1:38:29.910
I know, I know, but we have to go.

1:38:30.077 --> 1:38:31.453
-No!
-Come on.

1:39:21.712 --> 1:39:22.921
You son of a...

1:39:26.008 --> 1:39:27.509
-Oh, God.
-Scott.

1:39:27.801 --> 1:39:28.802
Come on.

1:39:33.557 --> 1:39:36.185
You think this is new to me?

1:39:37.519 --> 1:39:42.232
Do you know how many rebellions
I have put down?

1:39:43.942 --> 1:39:45.402
No, no, no.

1:39:45.569 --> 1:39:49.072
How many worlds I've conquered?

1:39:49.948 --> 1:39:52.159
How many Avengers I've killed?

1:39:52.326 --> 1:39:54.870
And you think you can beat me?

1:39:55.037 --> 1:39:56.663
I am Kang!

1:39:56.830 --> 1:39:57.748
You...

1:39:58.790 --> 1:40:01.043
You talk to ants.

1:41:20.914 --> 1:41:23.458
My name is Darren...

1:41:23.625 --> 1:41:28.130
and I am not a dick!

1:41:49.651 --> 1:41:50.903
Sorry I'm late.

1:41:53.197 --> 1:41:54.448
Lotta ants.

1:41:55.866 --> 1:41:56.867
Oh, is this you?

1:41:58.994 --> 1:42:00.454
You were right about me, Cassie.

1:42:01.747 --> 1:42:02.748
Darren.

1:42:04.541 --> 1:42:05.542
Are you okay?

1:42:08.295 --> 1:42:09.546
Probably not.

1:42:10.881 --> 1:42:12.549
-Darren?
-Hi, Hope.

1:42:13.509 --> 1:42:15.010
You changed your hair.

1:42:17.721 --> 1:42:19.598
What the hell happened?

1:42:20.349 --> 1:42:21.183
Yeah. No...

1:42:21.725 --> 1:42:23.185
It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.

1:42:23.977 --> 1:42:24.978
That was...

1:42:25.521 --> 1:42:26.939
I don't know what to say.

1:42:27.523 --> 1:42:28.815
Thanks, Scott.

1:42:29.441 --> 1:42:32.653
You always were a brother to me.

1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:35.781
I was?

1:42:43.664 --> 1:42:44.748
I was.

1:42:58.887 --> 1:43:00.556
And at least I died...

1:43:02.099 --> 1:43:03.642
an Avenger.

1:43:06.895 --> 1:43:07.938
Yeah.

1:43:08.981 --> 1:43:09.857
-You did.
-Yeah.

1:43:10.732 --> 1:43:11.733
You're in.

1:43:28.333 --> 1:43:29.960
A lot has happened today.

1:43:30.752 --> 1:43:31.879
-Henry?
-Janet?

1:43:32.045 --> 1:43:33.881
-Mom, where are you?
-I'm in the tower.

1:43:34.047 --> 1:43:36.049
I think I can give us one shot back.

1:43:36.216 --> 1:43:38.010
But we don't have much time.

1:43:38.218 --> 1:43:39.845
If we wanna go home...

1:43:42.306 --> 1:43:43.724
we have to go now.

1:43:44.349 --> 1:43:45.350
We'll finish this.

1:43:47.644 --> 1:43:48.687
Thank you.

1:43:49.771 --> 1:43:50.647
Thank you.

1:43:52.733 --> 1:43:54.276
Come on! Let's go!

1:43:54.443 --> 1:43:55.652
All right. Good luck.

1:43:56.028 --> 1:43:57.070
Good luck.
Come on.

1:44:27.768 --> 1:44:28.769
Thanks, buddy.

1:44:31.104 --> 1:44:32.105
You did it.

1:44:35.901 --> 1:44:37.027
Let's go home.

1:44:58.882 --> 1:44:59.883
Where's Scott?

1:45:00.050 --> 1:45:01.593
He was right behind me.

1:45:44.678 --> 1:45:46.263
You should've looked the other way.

1:45:46.430 --> 1:45:49.099
Yeah, well, never been great at that.

1:45:57.065 --> 1:45:58.525
And you're not getting out.

1:46:09.119 --> 1:46:10.537
I want you to remember.

1:46:12.039 --> 1:46:13.582
You could've gone home.

1:46:28.722 --> 1:46:30.766
You could've seen your daughter again.

1:46:44.530 --> 1:46:45.948
But you thought you could win.

1:46:59.336 --> 1:47:00.838
I don't have to win.

1:47:02.339 --> 1:47:04.258
We both just have to lose.

1:47:55.350 --> 1:47:56.727
Dad!

1:48:03.859 --> 1:48:04.860
Where... Where...

1:48:05.152 --> 1:48:06.236
Where is she? Is she...

1:48:06.403 --> 1:48:07.905
-No, she's okay.
-Where is she?

1:48:08.071 --> 1:48:09.448
She's okay. She's okay.

1:48:09.865 --> 1:48:11.325
-Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay.
-She's safe?

1:48:11.491 --> 1:48:12.492
You did it.

1:48:12.659 --> 1:48:13.660
You did it.

1:48:17.080 --> 1:48:18.999
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-No, no, no.

1:48:19.166 --> 1:48:20.584
No, don't let go. Don't let go.

1:48:21.210 --> 1:48:22.377
Don't let go.

1:48:22.544 --> 1:48:23.795
Don't ever let go.

1:48:25.422 --> 1:48:26.757
I got you.

1:48:29.551 --> 1:48:30.719
You came back.

1:48:41.104 --> 1:48:42.397
I love you, Hope.

1:48:45.067 --> 1:48:46.401
I love you, Scott.

1:50:00.267 --> 1:50:01.602
Let's go home.

1:50:04.271 --> 1:50:05.480
Home's good.

1:50:13.906 --> 1:50:15.574
My life doesn't make sense.

1:50:15.741 --> 1:50:18.076
I used to ask myself a lot of questions
about that.

1:50:18.243 --> 1:50:20.954
"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm
with your family...

1:50:21.121 --> 1:50:22.998
"and drank a guy without holes.

1:50:23.165 --> 1:50:25.417
"Why does this kind of stuff keep
happening to you?

1:50:25.584 --> 1:50:27.085
"That doesn't make any sense."

1:50:27.252 --> 1:50:28.587
But you know what?

1:50:28.754 --> 1:50:30.756
Who said life has to make sense?

1:50:35.093 --> 1:50:36.094
Rubin!

1:50:36.261 --> 1:50:37.471
You are the bug!

1:50:38.722 --> 1:50:41.225
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1:50:41.391 --> 1:50:42.684
You're the bug man.

1:50:42.851 --> 1:50:45.437
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1:50:46.104 --> 1:50:48.732
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1:50:48.899 --> 1:50:49.900
Twelve dollar.

1:50:51.735 --> 1:50:52.778
Twelve!

1:50:52.945 --> 1:50:55.489
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over...

1:50:55.656 --> 1:50:58.825
but as Cassie reminded me,
"There's always someone you can help."

1:50:59.618 --> 1:51:01.995
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1:51:04.456 --> 1:51:05.457
Wow.

1:51:06.166 --> 1:51:07.459
You made this yourself?

1:51:07.626 --> 1:51:10.045
-Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes.
-I know.

1:51:10.212 --> 1:51:12.005
This is the first one I've made since 1997.

1:51:12.172 --> 1:51:13.382
You're a real artist.

1:51:13.549 --> 1:51:15.509
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1:51:15.676 --> 1:51:18.095
One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...

1:51:18.262 --> 1:51:21.056
the next you're beating a time-traveling
space king.

1:51:22.140 --> 1:51:24.101
We did beat him, right?

1:51:25.561 --> 1:51:26.770
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1:51:26.937 --> 1:51:29.106
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

1:51:30.566 --> 1:51:31.650
I think.

1:51:33.151 --> 1:51:35.737
But he also said something bad was coming...

1:51:36.154 --> 1:51:39.241
and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.

1:51:39.408 --> 1:51:42.035
Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?

1:51:42.744 --> 1:51:44.788
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

1:51:44.955 --> 1:51:46.081
Oh, my God.

1:51:47.207 --> 1:51:48.667
Oh my... What did I do?

1:51:50.878 --> 1:51:52.254
What did I do?

1:51:55.757 --> 1:51:57.843
You know what? It's probably fine.

1:51:58.385 --> 1:52:00.470
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense...

1:52:00.637 --> 1:52:03.765
so maybe stop asking so
many questions, Scott.

1:52:03.932 --> 1:52:05.392
Stop overthinking it.

1:52:07.895 --> 1:52:09.688
Surprise!

1:52:09.855 --> 1:52:13.984
Happy Birthday to you

1:52:15.194 --> 1:52:16.528
It's not my birthday.

1:52:16.695 --> 1:52:19.198
I know. But I missed a few.

1:52:21.617 --> 1:52:23.493
This is good. We're all together.

1:52:23.869 --> 1:52:25.287
You're fine.

1:52:25.454 --> 1:52:28.373
Everything's probably fine.

1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:30.876
Kang's gone. You did it.

1:52:32.002 --> 1:52:33.754
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

1:52:33.921 --> 1:52:34.922
Thanks.

1:52:38.425 --> 1:52:40.427
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1:55:18.293 --> 1:55:21.880
So, the exiled one is dead.

1:55:24.174 --> 1:55:26.093
You sure he's dead?

1:55:26.718 --> 1:55:29.596
If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you.

1:55:30.222 --> 1:55:33.350
Must really eat you up,
that you're not the one who killed him.

1:55:33.684 --> 1:55:36.353
None of us...

1:55:37.187 --> 1:55:38.897
killed him.

1:55:41.191 --> 1:55:42.568
They did.

1:55:43.443 --> 1:55:47.990
They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.

1:55:48.657 --> 1:55:50.117
And if we let them...

1:55:50.576 --> 1:55:52.411
they will take...

1:55:53.829 --> 1:55:55.455
everything...

1:55:56.373 --> 1:55:58.375
we've built.

1:55:59.418 --> 1:56:01.962
So let's stop wasting time.

1:56:05.591 --> 1:56:06.800
We're late.

1:56:08.802 --> 1:56:11.138
How many did you call?

1:56:11.471 --> 1:56:13.891
All of us.

2:03:36.792 --> 2:03:41.797
Time is everything.

2:03:47.052 --> 2:03:50.055
It shapes our lives.

2:03:51.348 --> 2:03:55.310
But, perhaps, we can shape...

2:03:57.104 --> 2:03:58.188
it.

2:03:59.439 --> 2:04:00.566
It's him.

2:04:00.983 --> 2:04:04.278
What? You made him sound
like this terrifying figure.

2:04:05.946 --> 2:04:07.030
He is.
