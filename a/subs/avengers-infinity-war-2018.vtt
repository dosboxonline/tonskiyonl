WEBVTT

00:24.520 --> 00:26.360
This is the Asgardian

00:26.440 --> 00:28.920
refugee vessel Statesman.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.960
We are under assault.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.120
I repeat,
we are under assault.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.840
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.960
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.120
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.760
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.320
We have
very few soldiers here.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.400
This is not a warcraft.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.480
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.960
EBONY MAW:
Hear me and rejoice.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.000
You have had the privilege

01:17.080 --> 01:19.760
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.920
You may think
this is suffering.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
No.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.520
It is salvation.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.080
Universal scales
tip toward balance

01:38.160 --> 01:39.920
because of your sacrifice.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.960
Smile.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.160
-

01:44.240 --> 01:46.320
For even in death,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.840
you have become
Children of Thanos.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.320
I know what it's like to lose.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.480
To feel so desperately
that you're right...

02:12.200 --> 02:14.960
yet to fail, nonetheless.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.680
It's frightening.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Turns the legs to jelly.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.240
But I ask you, to what end?

02:33.640 --> 02:36.240
Dread it, run from it...

02:37.280 --> 02:39.840
destiny arrives all the same.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.880
And now, it's here.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.280
Or should I say...

02:46.640 --> 02:48.160
I am.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.920
You talk too much.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.640
The Tesseract.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.160
Or your brother's head.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.240
I assume you have
a preference.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.760
Oh, I do.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Kill away.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.160
-

03:28.480 --> 03:29.600
All right, stop!

03:33.160 --> 03:35.120
We don't have the Tesseract.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.080
It was destroyed on Asgard.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.760
You really are
the worst brother.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.720
I assure you, brother...

03:57.920 --> 03:59.920
the sun will shine
on us again.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.800
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.920
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
And for another...

04:12.760 --> 04:13.960
we have a Hulk.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.000
-Let him have his fun.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.760
Allfathers...

05:23.640 --> 05:26.920
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...

05:27.760 --> 05:28.840
time.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.120
That was a mistake.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.680
No!

06:01.840 --> 06:04.440
You're going to die for that.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.800
Shh.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.440
My humble personage...

06:18.880 --> 06:21.160
bows before your grandeur.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.680
No other being
has ever had the might...

06:28.080 --> 06:29.760
nay, the nobility...

06:30.160 --> 06:34.840
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

06:38.320 --> 06:42.720
The universe lies
within your grasp.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.720
There are two more stones
on Earth.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.680
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.400
Father, we will not fail you.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.080
LOKI: If I might interject.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.520
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.120
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.440
If you consider
failure experience.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.400
I consider
experience experience.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.080
Almighty Thanos...

07:49.400 --> 07:54.040
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

07:57.840 --> 07:59.040
Odinson...

08:02.960 --> 08:04.880
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...

08:05.520 --> 08:07.400
god of mischief...

08:08.280 --> 08:09.760
do hereby pledge to you...

08:11.200 --> 08:15.080
my undying fidelity.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.120
Undying?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.560
You should choose your words
more carefully.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.480
-

08:55.120 --> 08:56.120
You...

08:57.240 --> 08:58.840
will never be...

09:01.520 --> 09:02.680
a god.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
No!

09:28.960 --> 09:31.440
No resurrections this time.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.200
No. Loki.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.920
DR. STRANGE: Seriously,
you don't have any money?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.160
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.600
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.640
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.640
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.800
Dollars?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.320
-Rupees.
-Which is?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.320
-Uh, buck and a half.
-

10:52.480 --> 10:53.680
What do you want?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.480
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.920
Thanos is coming.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.720
He's coming.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.160
Who?

11:26.880 --> 11:28.280
STARK: Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.360
PEPPER:
You're totally rambling.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.480
STARK: No, I'm not.
PEPPER: You lost me.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.680
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

11:31.760 --> 11:32.880
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.080
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.360
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.600
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
-"Oh, someone's watching."
-Right.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.800
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

11:38.880 --> 11:39.960
And then you wake up
and in real life

11:40.040 --> 11:41.080
you actually have to pee.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.160
-Yes.
-Yeah.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.360
-Okay.
-Everybody has that.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.240
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.600
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.360
It was so real.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.080
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Uh, what was his name?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.600
-Right.
-Morgan! Morgan.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.400
-So you woke up...
-Naturally.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.120
...and thought that we were...

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
-Expecting.
-Yeah.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.400
-Yes?
-No.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.960
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.480
If you wanted to have a kid...

12:06.160 --> 12:07.560
you wouldn't have done that.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.120
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.680
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.280
You're not helping
your case, okay?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.480
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

12:14.640 --> 12:16.120
You don't need that.

12:16.440 --> 12:17.520
I know, I had the surgery.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.680
I'm just
trying to protect us...

12:18.880 --> 12:20.480
and future usses
and that's it.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.160
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.240
-Instead of, you know...
-Shirts.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.360
You know me so well.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.160
God.
-You finish all my sentences.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.600
You should have shirts
in your closet.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
Yeah.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.520
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.880
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.120
-Show off this Harry Winston.
-

12:40.200 --> 12:42.560
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.760
I should promise you.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.240
-Yes.
-I will.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.680
Thank you.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.960
DR. STRANGE: Tony Stark.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.160
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.720
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.680
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.280
We need your help.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.640
It's not overselling it
to say that

13:03.760 --> 13:05.320
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.920
And who's "we"?

13:08.640 --> 13:09.720
Hey, Tony.

13:09.880 --> 13:10.880
Bruce.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.680
-BANNER: Pepper.
-Hi.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.280
-BANNER: Oh.
-You okay?

13:19.080 --> 13:21.280
WONG: At the dawn
of the universe,

13:21.360 --> 13:23.280
there was nothing. Then...

13:23.680 --> 13:24.960
Boom.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.840
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.840
hurtling across
the virgin universe.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.440
These Infinity Stones

13:34.520 --> 13:37.440
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.560
DR. STRANGE: Space.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.880
Reality.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.640
Power.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.040
Soul.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.320
Mind.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.480
And Time.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.280
Tell me his name again.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.640
Thanos.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.080
He's a plague, Tony.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.040
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.360
He wipes out
half the population.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.240
He sent Loki.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.760
The attack on New York,
that's him.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.480
This is it.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.640
What's our timeline?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.960
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
That already makes him

14:23.200 --> 14:24.720
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

14:24.920 --> 14:28.160
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

14:28.320 --> 14:29.400
He could destroy life

14:29.480 --> 14:31.520
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.520
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

14:33.720 --> 14:35.760
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.440
-Is that what it is?
-

14:40.160 --> 14:42.080
I'm going to allow that.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.760
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

14:45.840 --> 14:47.200
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
No can do.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.280
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.600
STARK:
And I swore off dairy...

14:52.760 --> 14:55.160
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.760
-Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
-Not bad.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.320
A bit chalky.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.040
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.320
-That's a thing?
-Whatever.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.560
Point is, things change.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.480
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.680
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.880
Yeah, so conversely,

15:08.960 --> 15:10.760
it may also be
his best chance against us.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.280
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.440
What is your job exactly?

15:13.520 --> 15:15.160
Besides making
balloon animals.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.840
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.520
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.560
The fact is
we have this stone.

15:23.640 --> 15:24.920
We know where it is.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.640
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...

15:27.800 --> 15:29.520
and we have to find him now.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.720
Yeah, that's the thing.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
What do you mean?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.120
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.280
He's offline.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.680
-What?
-Yeah.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.760
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

15:39.920 --> 15:42.200
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.800
Who could find Vision then?

15:46.800 --> 15:47.840
Shit.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.480
Probably Steve Rogers.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.840
Oh, great.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.480
Maybe.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.120
But...

15:57.600 --> 15:58.720
Call him.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.760
It's not that easy.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.640
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
No.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.560
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.240
Broke up?

16:10.160 --> 16:12.040
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.160
Cap and I fell out hard.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.320
We're not on speaking terms.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.280
Tony, listen to me.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.680
Thor's gone.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.560
Thanos is coming.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.280
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.560
STARK: Flip phone.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.840
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

17:07.960 --> 17:09.120
moving your hair, would ya?

17:10.080 --> 17:12.280
Not at the moment, no.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.920
-

17:44.960 --> 17:46.800
-You okay?
-

17:47.920 --> 17:48.960
-Help him!
-WONG: Banner!

17:49.120 --> 17:50.680
-Wong! Look alive!
-Go, go! We got it!

17:50.880 --> 17:51.920
Friday, what am I looking at?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.320
FRIDAY: Not sure.
I'm working on it.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.520
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone

17:55.600 --> 17:56.840
in your back pocket, Doc!

17:57.000 --> 17:58.200
Might wanna use it.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.920
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.400
Holy shit.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.240
We're all gonna die!

18:31.400 --> 18:32.600
There's a spaceship!

18:32.760 --> 18:34.480
BOY: What's going on?
NED: Oh, my God!

18:43.040 --> 18:44.120
What's the matter
with you kids?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.000
You never seen
a spaceship before?

18:58.240 --> 19:00.600
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.680
Notify first responders.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.000
FRIDAY: Will do.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.280
Hear me and rejoice.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.120
You are about to die

19:37.200 --> 19:39.280
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.880
-Be thankful...

19:42.040 --> 19:44.600
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

19:44.960 --> 19:47.720
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.600
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.920
Stonekeeper.

19:52.880 --> 19:55.120
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

19:55.280 --> 19:57.080
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.960
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.400
He means get lost, Squidward.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.760
He exhausts me.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.880
-Bring me the stone.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.960
Banner, you want a piece?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.320
Mmm, no, not really.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.720
But when do I ever get
what I want?

20:12.880 --> 20:13.880
That's right.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.800
Okay. Push!

20:15.960 --> 20:17.440
It's been a while.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.080
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.240
Okay. Shh.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.080
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.560
Come on, come on, man.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.880
-BANNER: God!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.280
Where's your guy?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.080
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.280
-It's no time for a thing.
-I know.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.880
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.280
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.360
Either I can't or he won't.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.440
It's okay.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.920
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.400
-I have him.
-Damn it.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.280
Where'd that come from?

21:19.440 --> 21:20.480
IRON MAN: It's nanotech.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.600
You like it?
A little something I...

21:25.360 --> 21:27.680
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend

21:27.760 --> 21:28.920
won't be joining us...

21:38.560 --> 21:39.840
IRON MAN: Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.280
It stays with me.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.400
Exactly. Bye.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.360
BANNER: Tony, you okay?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.480
-How we doing? Good? Bad?
-Really, really good.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.680
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

21:56.840 --> 21:58.160
I'm trying. He won't come out.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.120
IRON MAN: Hammer.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.760
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?

22:11.920 --> 22:14.040
Come out! Come out! Come out!

22:14.200 --> 22:16.400
No!

22:20.280 --> 22:22.080
What do you mean, "no"?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.480
SPIDER-MAN: Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?

22:29.640 --> 22:32.440
-Kid, where'd you come from?
-A field trip to MoMA.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.920
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.120
Uh, he's from space.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.160
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.400
-

23:06.800 --> 23:08.640
Your powers are quaint.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.480
You must be popular
with children.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.240
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.360
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.480
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.360
You'll only wish
you were dead.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.000
-

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
No!

23:52.760 --> 23:54.280
IRON MAN: Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.960
SPIDER-MAN: On it!

24:03.400 --> 24:04.760
Not cool.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Gotcha!

24:11.240 --> 24:12.240
Wait!

24:20.200 --> 24:22.880
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.320
IRON MAN: Hang on, kid.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.400
-BANNER: Oh!

24:43.200 --> 24:44.200
Ugh.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.040
IRON MAN: Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.720
Give me a little juice,
Friday.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.040
Unlock 17:A.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.680
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.880
SPIDER-MAN: But you said
save the wizard!

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
I can't breathe.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.280
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.480
Yeah. That makes sense.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.680
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

25:48.840 --> 25:49.880
IRON MAN: Happy trails, kid.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.400
-Friday, send him home.
-FRIDAY: Yep.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.800
SPIDER-MAN: Oh, come on!

26:02.240 --> 26:04.240
FRIDAY: Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
PEPPER: Tony? Oh, my God.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
Are you all right?
What's going on?

26:06.640 --> 26:07.920
IRON MAN: Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think

26:08.040 --> 26:09.320
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.480
PEPPER: Why?

26:10.560 --> 26:12.080
IRON MAN: Just 'cause
I'll probably

26:12.160 --> 26:13.560
not make it back for a while.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.920
PEPPER: Tell me
you're not on that ship.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yeah.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.400
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.160
Honey, I'm sorry.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.480
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.840
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.080
-Pep.
-Come back here right now.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
Come back.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.280
FRIDAY: Boss,
we're losing her.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.520
I'm going too.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.840
SPIDER-MAN: Oh, my God!

26:45.320 --> 26:47.280
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.000
Where you going?

27:03.280 --> 27:04.680
The Time Stone's been taken.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.760
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.840
What will you do?

27:09.640 --> 27:11.280
I'm gonna make a call.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.760
Sing it, Drax!

28:05.360 --> 28:06.720
Why are we doing this again?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.520
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Someone could be dying.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.840
I get that,
but why are we doing it?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.800
'Cause we're nice.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
And maybe whoever it is

28:15.080 --> 28:16.720
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.240
-Which isn't the point.
-Which isn't the point.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.120
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...

28:21.280 --> 28:22.320
We take his ship.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.160
-ROCKET: Exactly!
-Bingo!

28:24.240 --> 28:25.240
ROCKET: All right!

28:28.560 --> 28:30.000
We are arriving.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.440
All right, Guardians,

28:31.520 --> 28:32.640
don't forget
this might be dangerous...

28:32.800 --> 28:35.080
so let's put on
our mean faces.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.880
Groot, put that
thing away, now.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
I don't wanna tell you again.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.160
-Groot.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.480
I am Groot!

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
-Whoa!
-ROCKET: Language!

28:46.680 --> 28:48.000
-Hey!
-Wow.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.840
You got some
acorns on you, kid.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.560
Ever since
you got a little sap,

28:51.640 --> 28:52.640
you're a total d-hole.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.880
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.320
MANTIS: What happened?

29:09.360 --> 29:10.720
Oh, my God.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.040
Looks like
we're not getting paid.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.240
Wipers! Wipers!

29:22.440 --> 29:23.720
Get it off.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.960
-

29:30.400 --> 29:33.160
How the hell
is this dude still alive?

29:33.320 --> 29:35.120
He is not a dude.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.800
You're a dude.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.200
This... This is a man.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.320
A handsome, muscular man.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
I'm muscular.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.560
But who are you
kidding, Quill?

29:45.680 --> 29:47.040
You're one sandwich
away from fat.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.120
PETER: Yeah, right.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.720
DRAX: It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
What?

29:53.080 --> 29:54.920
Gamora, do you think I'm...

29:57.200 --> 30:00.800
He is anxious, angry.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.840
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.480
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.640
PETER: Wow.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.600
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.480
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.680
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.120
ROCKET: You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.480
GAMORA: It's like his muscles

30:17.560 --> 30:19.480
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.360
Stop massaging his muscles.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.160
Wake him up.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.240
Wake.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.360
-

30:45.840 --> 30:48.080
Who the hell are you guys?

30:50.880 --> 30:54.520
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.400
To bring balance
to the universe

30:56.480 --> 30:58.640
by wiping out
half of all life.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.760
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

31:01.840 --> 31:03.240
massacre by massacre.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.920
Including my own.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.640
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...

31:06.840 --> 31:09.040
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.640
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.600
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.720
Your father killed my brother.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.240
Oh, boy.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.080
Stepfather, technically.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.160
And she hates him
as much as you do.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.440
THOR: Families can be tough.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.920
Before my father died,

31:35.040 --> 31:36.760
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

31:36.920 --> 31:39.200
that he imprisoned in Hel.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.320
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.760
So I had to kill her.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.000
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.320
Goes round and round and...

31:48.160 --> 31:49.160
I feel your pain.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.600
I feel your pain as well,
because...

31:51.800 --> 31:52.960
I mean,
it's not a competition,

31:53.040 --> 31:54.160
but I've been through a lot.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.000
-My father killed my mother.
-

31:56.160 --> 31:57.280
And then I had to kill
my father.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.880
-That was hard.
-

31:59.040 --> 32:01.920
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.360
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

32:05.520 --> 32:07.200
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.160
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

32:12.680 --> 32:15.240
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.680
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Taking your pod.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.200
No, you're not.

32:23.320 --> 32:27.200
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.080
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.640
-No.
-You are.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.480
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.840
No, I'm not.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.040
He just did it again!
-This is my voice.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
Are you mocking me?

32:48.680 --> 32:51.600
-Are you mocking me?
-Stop it. You did it again.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.080
He's trying to copy me.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.160
I need you to stop doing that.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.960
-GAMORA: Enough!
-He's doing it first.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.520
We need to stop Thanos.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.240
Which means
we need to find out

32:59.320 --> 33:00.320
where he's going next.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.720
Knowhere.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.560
He must be going somewhere.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
No, no. Knowhere?

33:05.920 --> 33:08.560
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.160
-Excuse me, that's our food.
-Not anymore.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.760
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

33:14.920 --> 33:16.080
THOR: Because for years...

33:16.240 --> 33:18.400
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

33:18.480 --> 33:19.920
with a man
called the Collector.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.680
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.560
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.080
-Or a genius.
-GAMORA: How do you know...

33:25.240 --> 33:27.800
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

33:27.960 --> 33:30.360
There are six stones
out there.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.720
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

33:32.880 --> 33:36.160
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.680
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

33:38.840 --> 33:41.520
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.320
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
They're with the Avengers.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.000
-The Avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.280
Like Kevin Bacon?

33:48.440 --> 33:49.720
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

33:49.840 --> 33:50.800
I haven't been there
in a while.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.200
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.000
No one even knows where it is.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.920
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.440
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.040
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.240
You're welcome.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.640
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.480
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.760
-That's a made-up word.
-All words are made up.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.000
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

34:13.160 --> 34:14.800
That place is a legend.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.400
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

34:16.480 --> 34:18.520
to ever torment the universe.

34:18.680 --> 34:20.720
I would very much like
to go there, please.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.880
The rabbit is correct

34:21.960 --> 34:23.040
and clearly the smartest
among you.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.160
Rabbit?

34:24.320 --> 34:26.560
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

34:26.720 --> 34:27.920
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
You're very perceptive.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.480
You seem like a noble leader.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.160
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

34:32.320 --> 34:35.120
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

34:35.280 --> 34:37.040
-Yeah. I'll go.
-Wonderful!

34:37.200 --> 34:38.320
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.400
THOR: Quiet.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.080
-That's my backpack.
-ROCKET: Go sit down.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.880
PETER: Look, this is my ship.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.800
And I'm not goin' to...

34:45.800 --> 34:47.880
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

34:48.040 --> 34:49.280
The Thanos-killing kind.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.640
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

34:51.800 --> 34:53.840
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.080
Your bodies would crumble

34:55.160 --> 34:56.360
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.440
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

34:58.600 --> 34:59.760
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.200
If we don't go to Knowhere

35:01.280 --> 35:02.840
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

35:03.040 --> 35:04.560
he'll be too powerful to stop.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.880
-He already is.
-I got it figured out.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.760
We got two ships

35:08.840 --> 35:10.240
and a large assortment
of morons.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.640
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.000
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

35:15.080 --> 35:16.640
to try to stop Thanos.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.760
-Cool? Cool.
-So cool.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.200
PETER: For the record...

35:20.960 --> 35:22.280
I know that
you're going with him

35:22.360 --> 35:23.440
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.120
You know, you really shouldn't

35:25.200 --> 35:27.320
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.640
Come on, Groot.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.880
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.440
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.720
Bye.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.160
-

35:55.480 --> 35:56.640
Vis?

35:57.080 --> 35:59.000
Is it the stone again?

35:59.160 --> 36:00.800
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.120
What does it say?

36:04.040 --> 36:06.360
I don't... I don't know,
but something.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.840
-Hey.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.160
Tell me what you feel.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.920
I just feel you.

36:40.080 --> 36:42.000
WANDA: So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...

36:42.160 --> 36:44.160
which would give us more time
together before you went back.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.800
VISION: What if
I miss that train?

36:45.960 --> 36:46.960
There's an 11:00.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.520
What if I missed
all the trains?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.640
What if this time
I didn't go back?

36:52.800 --> 36:54.120
But you gave Stark your word.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.480
I'd rather give it to you.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.600
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.080
We both made promises.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.960
Not to each other.

37:01.400 --> 37:02.400
Wanda.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.680
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

37:05.840 --> 37:07.880
trying to see
if this could work and...

37:09.800 --> 37:11.760
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.640
I think...

37:13.800 --> 37:14.880
-WANDA: It works.
-It works.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.360
It works.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.080
Stay.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.640
Stay with me.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.680
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

37:37.720 --> 37:39.480
What are they?

37:39.800 --> 37:42.240
What the stone
was warning me about.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.520
I have to go.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.600
No, Vision.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.480
Vision, if that's true,

37:56.560 --> 37:59.360
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.480
Wanda, I...

38:01.640 --> 38:03.680
-Vision!
-

38:31.840 --> 38:34.520
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.400
-Is that even possible?
-It isn't supposed to be.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.200
My systems are failing.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.760
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
Vis!

38:56.400 --> 38:59.800
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.120
Hands off.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.200
Come on. Come on.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.160
Come on, you gotta get up.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.520
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.040
Hey. We have to go.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.520
Please. Please leave.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.440
You asked me to stay.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.880
-I'm staying.
-Please.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.760
-Get up.
-I can't.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.640
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.000
You'll never get
the chance again.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.520
Can you stand?

41:52.240 --> 41:53.680
Thank you, Captain.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.000
Let's get you on the jet.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.400
Now, I thought we had a deal.

42:05.560 --> 42:09.280
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.800
WANDA: I'm sorry.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.720
We just wanted time.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.720
SAM: Where to, Cap?

42:19.520 --> 42:21.040
Home.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.560
-

42:24.640 --> 42:26.680
WOMAN: We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.600
-

42:32.240 --> 42:33.680
-

42:51.240 --> 42:52.280
Zehobereians.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.200
Mother! Where's my mother?

42:54.360 --> 42:55.680
EBONY MAW:
Choose a side or die.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.320
GIRL: Mother!

42:57.480 --> 42:59.680
EBONY MAW: One side
is a revelation...

42:59.840 --> 43:02.880
the other an honor
known only to a few.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.240
What's wrong, little one?

43:05.880 --> 43:09.280
My mother. Where is my mother?

43:14.080 --> 43:15.320
What's your name?

43:16.640 --> 43:18.320
Gamora.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.920
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.480
Come.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
Let me help you.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.480
Look.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.840
Pretty, isn't it?

43:45.600 --> 43:49.040
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.960
Too much to one side
or the other...

43:56.960 --> 43:59.800
Here. You try.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.640
EBONY MAW: Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.000
-THANOS: Uh-uh.

44:11.920 --> 44:13.440
Concentrate.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.200
There. You've got it.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.800
PETER: Gamora.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.960
Do you know if these grenades

44:32.040 --> 44:34.200
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

44:34.400 --> 44:35.480
Because I was thinking about

44:35.560 --> 44:37.120
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.320
But I don't want to
if they're the...

44:38.400 --> 44:39.640
GAMORA: I need to ask a favor.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.880
Yeah, sure.

44:43.440 --> 44:44.520
GAMORA: One way or another,

44:44.600 --> 44:46.840
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.120
Which is what
the grenades are for.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.360
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?

44:55.680 --> 44:56.680
If things go wrong...

44:58.320 --> 45:00.440
If Thanos gets me...

45:05.000 --> 45:06.960
I want you to promise me...

45:08.000 --> 45:09.120
you'll kill me.

45:09.880 --> 45:10.880
What?

45:14.040 --> 45:16.440
I know something he doesn't.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.200
And if he finds it out,

45:21.280 --> 45:22.640
the entire universe
could be at risk.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.400
What do you know?

45:24.560 --> 45:26.600
If I tell you, you'd know too.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.480
If it's so important...

45:31.560 --> 45:32.600
shouldn't I?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.000
Only if you wanna die.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.720
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.160
Just...

45:40.560 --> 45:43.560
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.080
I mean, I'd like to.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.080
-I really would. But you...
-

45:48.240 --> 45:49.440
Swear to me.

45:52.960 --> 45:55.240
Swear to me on your mother.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.280
Okay.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.480
Okay.

46:26.720 --> 46:27.760
-Oh.
-Dude.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.360
How long have you been
standing there?

46:29.440 --> 46:30.440
An hour.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.240
An hour?

46:32.800 --> 46:34.080
Are you serious?

46:34.240 --> 46:36.400
I've mastered the ability

46:36.520 --> 46:39.160
of standing
so incredibly still...

46:40.400 --> 46:42.960
that I become
invisible to the eye.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.600
Watch.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.080
You're eating a zarg-nut.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.960
But my movement...

46:52.800 --> 46:54.440
was so slow...

46:55.280 --> 46:57.120
that it's imperceptible.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.280
Mmm, no.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.680
I'm sure I'm invisible.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.040
MANTIS: Hi, Drax.

47:04.720 --> 47:05.760
Damn it.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.400
This place looks deserted.

47:27.560 --> 47:30.320
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

47:30.480 --> 47:32.400
PETER: Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.280
Let's put down right here.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.560
THE COLLECTOR:
I don't have it.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.400
THANOS: Everyone
in the galaxy knows

47:52.480 --> 47:53.920
you'd sell your own brother...

47:54.080 --> 47:55.720
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

47:55.880 --> 47:57.800
to your pathetic collection.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.000
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.

48:08.960 --> 48:12.440
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.280
I told you.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.080
I sold it.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.960
Why would I lie?

48:24.120 --> 48:26.320
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.880
Like suicide.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.520
You do understand.

48:31.480 --> 48:34.480
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.

48:34.680 --> 48:36.040
I didn't know what it was.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.000
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.360
It's him.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.000
THANOS: Last chance,
charlatan.

48:43.560 --> 48:45.520
Where's the stone?

48:45.680 --> 48:46.680
Today...

48:47.080 --> 48:48.080
Drax. Drax.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.240
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.360
Drax, wait.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.240
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.640
Drax.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.760
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.200
He doesn't have the stone yet.

49:04.360 --> 49:06.000
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.000
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.240
No.

49:11.400 --> 49:14.440
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.200
Sleep.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.120
Okay.

49:29.280 --> 49:33.400
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.000
The other right.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.040
Why?

50:12.040 --> 50:16.080
Why you, daughter?

50:34.720 --> 50:35.760
That was quick.

50:41.520 --> 50:46.400
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

50:48.760 --> 50:51.480
THANOS: Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

50:54.600 --> 50:57.080
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.720
But one never knows for sure.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.800
Reality is often
disappointing.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.200
That is, it was.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.640
Now...

51:30.640 --> 51:33.440
reality can be
whatever I want.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.440
You knew I'd come.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.240
THANOS: I counted on it.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.920
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.280
Thanos!

51:55.880 --> 51:56.920
No!

52:01.280 --> 52:02.880
Let her go, Grimace.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.320
GAMORA: Peter.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.040
I told you to go right.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.000
Now? Really?

52:09.160 --> 52:10.600
You let her go!

52:11.000 --> 52:12.720
-Ah, the boyfriend.
-

52:12.880 --> 52:13.880
No.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.200
Like to think of myself

52:15.280 --> 52:17.760
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

52:17.920 --> 52:19.960
-Let her go.
-Peter.

52:20.160 --> 52:24.840
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

52:25.440 --> 52:26.920
Not him.

52:37.400 --> 52:41.120
You promised. You promised.

52:45.280 --> 52:46.480
THANOS: Oh, daughter.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.440
You expect too much from him.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.640
She's asked, hasn't she?

52:58.600 --> 52:59.600
Do it.

53:03.440 --> 53:04.680
Mmm.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.360
-Do it!

53:14.120 --> 53:15.520
I told you to go right.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.440
I love you more than anything.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.080
I love you too.

53:39.400 --> 53:40.440
I like him.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.040
Still no word from Vision?

54:13.200 --> 54:15.840
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.520
On a stolen Quinjet

54:17.600 --> 54:19.400
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.440
You know they're
only criminals because

54:21.520 --> 54:23.000
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

54:23.200 --> 54:24.320
My God, Rhodes.

54:24.480 --> 54:27.680
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.

54:27.840 --> 54:28.960
If it weren't
for those Accords,

54:29.040 --> 54:30.440
Vision would've been
right here.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.400
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.920
That's right.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.720
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.120
You have second thoughts?

54:41.280 --> 54:43.000
Not anymore.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.400
Mr. Secretary.

54:54.960 --> 54:56.640
You got some nerve.

54:57.280 --> 54:58.920
I'll give you that.

54:59.080 --> 55:00.840
You could use
some of that right now.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.920
The world's on fire.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.800
And you think all is forgiven?

55:08.400 --> 55:10.280
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.480
And I'm way past
asking permission.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.480
Earth just lost
her best defender.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.200
So we're here to fight.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.680
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

55:22.680 --> 55:24.600
we'll fight you too.

55:27.880 --> 55:28.880
Arrest them.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.600
All over it.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.040
That's a court-martial.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.520
It's great to see you, Cap.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.400
-You too, Rhodey.
-

55:44.480 --> 55:45.480
Hey.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.080
Wow. You guys...

55:49.920 --> 55:51.920
really look like crap.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.680
Must've been
a rough couple years.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.520
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

55:56.960 --> 55:59.160
BANNER: Uh, I think
you look great.

56:02.480 --> 56:03.560
Uh...

56:06.240 --> 56:08.280
Yeah, I'm back.

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
Hi, Bruce.

56:16.480 --> 56:17.520
Nat.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.480
This is awkward.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.520
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

56:26.680 --> 56:27.840
And they can clearly find us.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.240
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

56:30.520 --> 56:31.960
After the whole
Accords situation,

56:32.080 --> 56:33.600
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

56:33.760 --> 56:35.320
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.720
-BANNER: Who's Scott?
-Ant-Man.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.360
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

56:39.280 --> 56:40.320
Okay, look.

56:40.400 --> 56:43.240
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

56:43.400 --> 56:46.800
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

56:48.640 --> 56:49.680
Vision's stone.

56:49.880 --> 56:51.120
Then we have to protect it.

56:51.280 --> 56:52.920
No, we have to destroy it.

56:55.080 --> 56:56.360
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

56:56.440 --> 56:57.440
to this entity in my head.

56:57.640 --> 56:59.120
About its nature.

56:59.680 --> 57:01.840
But also its composition.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I think if it were exposed

57:04.080 --> 57:05.920
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

57:06.080 --> 57:09.920
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

57:11.520 --> 57:13.680
its molecular integrity
could fail.

57:14.240 --> 57:16.480
Yeah, and you with it.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.400
We're not having
this conversation.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.560
VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

57:20.640 --> 57:22.640
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.400
That's too high a price.

57:29.920 --> 57:32.280
Only you have
the power to pay it.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.600
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.280
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.880
But it should.

57:45.360 --> 57:46.760
We don't trade lives, Vision.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.880
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

57:49.040 --> 57:50.840
to save how many
millions of people?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.040
Tell me,
why is this any different?

57:53.200 --> 57:55.520
BANNER: Because you might
have a choice.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.160
Your mind is made up

57:58.240 --> 58:00.600
of a complex construct
of overlays.

58:00.760 --> 58:04.360
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

58:04.520 --> 58:06.280
All of them mixed together,

58:06.360 --> 58:07.840
all of them
learning from one another.

58:08.240 --> 58:10.000
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

58:10.160 --> 58:13.240
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

58:13.400 --> 58:14.840
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.360
Perhaps the best parts.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.040
Can we do that?

58:18.760 --> 58:19.800
Not me, not here.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.320
RHODES: Well,
you better find someone

58:22.400 --> 58:23.600
and somewhere fast.

58:23.760 --> 58:25.120
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

58:25.200 --> 58:26.400
have your old rooms back.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.040
I know somewhere.

58:45.680 --> 58:46.960
OKOYE: The Kingsguard

58:47.040 --> 58:48.320
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.

58:48.480 --> 58:50.040
And the Border Tribe?

58:50.480 --> 58:52.080
Those that are left.

58:52.360 --> 58:54.480
Send word
to the Jabari as well.

58:54.640 --> 58:56.760
M'Baku likes a good fight.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.760
And what of this one?

59:01.360 --> 59:03.520
This one may be tired of war.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.880
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.120
Where's the fight?

59:32.040 --> 59:33.440
On its way.

59:51.840 --> 59:54.440
In all the time
I've served Thanos...

59:56.320 --> 59:58.320
I have never failed him.

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:06.480
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...

1:00:06.640 --> 1:00:08.240
with the Time Stone
still attached

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.480
to your vaguely
irritating person...

1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:13.240
there would be judgment.

1:00:21.840 --> 1:00:23.360
Give me...

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.200
the stone.

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.040
Wow, you're a seriously

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.240
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.440
SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:46.960
STARK: What the...

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:48.880
-I know what you're gonna say.
-You should not be here.

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:50.120
-I was gonna go home.
-I don't wanna hear it.

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:51.280
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:52.600
-about you on the way...
-And now I gotta hear it.

1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:53.680
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:55.920
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:57.080
God damn it.

1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:00.040
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:01.520
-What did you just say?
- I take that back.

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:03.000
And now, I'm here in space.

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.600
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:07.840
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.240
This is a one-way ticket.

1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:10.880
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:11.960
No, I did think this through.

1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:13.680
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:15.360
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...

1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:17.080
if there's no neighborhood.

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:20.400
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:21.800
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

1:01:23.920 --> 1:01:26.800
Come on. We got a situation.

1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:28.800
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:29.880
What's your plan?

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:31.160
-Go.
-Um...

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.240
Okay, okay... Uh...

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:36.720
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:42.520
EBONY MAW:
Painful, aren't they?

1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:46.280
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:49.040
-And any one of them...
-

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:56.320
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

1:01:56.920 --> 1:01:58.560
IRON MAN: I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:01.400
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:04.920
You've saved nothing.

1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:07.800
Your powers
are inconsequential

1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.120
compared to mine.

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.160
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:27.480
SPIDER-MAN: Yes! Wait.
What are those?

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:44.840
SPIDER-MAN: Hey,
we haven't officially met.

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:47.240
Cool.

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:50.680
We gotta turn
this ship around.

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:52.840
STARK: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:54.400
No, I want to protect
the stone.

1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:55.760
STARK: And I want you
to thank me.

1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:57.360
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:00.240
DR. STRANGE: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:02.640
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:03.840
I seriously don't know

1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:05.080
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.480
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.160
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:11.240
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:13.000
And due to that fact,

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.400
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:16.240
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.320
-I'm backup.
-No, you're a stowaway.

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:19.520
The adults are talking.

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:22.240
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:24.040
What is he, your ward?

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:25.200
No.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.600
-I'm Peter, by the way.
-Doctor Strange.

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:29.480
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:31.680
I'm Spider-Man, then.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:34.120
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:35.200
Thing's on autopilot.

1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:37.080
DR. STRANGE:
Can we control it?

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.160
Fly us home?

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:43.160
-Stark?
-Yeah.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.560
Can you get us home?

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:46.000
Yeah, I heard you.

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:49.760
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:51.920
Under no circumstances

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.560
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:55.880
I don't think
you quite understand

1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:56.960
what's at stake here.

1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:59.480
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:02.400
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:04.120
Since he sent an army
to New York

1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:05.760
and now he's back.

1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:07.840
And I don't know what to do.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.200
So I'm not so sure

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.040
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:14.840
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.240
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:20.160
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:21.320
Doctor.

1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:24.680
Do you concur?

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:29.760
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.880
But you have to understand...

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:34.720
if it comes to saving you

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:37.240
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:40.240
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:44.760
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:48.240
Nice. Good, moral compass.

1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.000
We're straight.

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:53.640
All right, kid.

1:04:54.920 --> 1:04:55.960
You're an Avenger now.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:34.840
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.560
I always hated that chair.

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.800
THANOS: So I've been told.

1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:55.360
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1:05:56.120 --> 1:05:57.680
I hated this room.

1:05:58.560 --> 1:05:59.840
This ship.

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.800
I hated my life.

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:08.480
THANOS: You told me that too.

1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.000
Every day.

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:17.760
For almost 20 years.

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:22.720
I was a child
when you took me.

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:24.960
I saved you.

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:29.440
No.

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:34.480
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:35.840
Going to bed hungry...

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:38.040
scrounging for scraps.

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:41.080
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:43.240
I'm the one who stopped that.

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:45.560
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:47.360
The children born...

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:51.360
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:52.760
It's a paradise.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:57.320
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:00.360
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:01.520
You're insane.

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:03.640
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:06.600
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:11.160
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:12.640
It needs correction.

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:14.200
You don't know that!

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.800
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:22.800
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:25.360
For a time...

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:32.200
you had that same will...

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.240
as you fought by my side.

1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:38.160
Daughter.

1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:40.720
I'm not your daughter.

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.880
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:48.120
And, in doing so,

1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:50.440
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:56.200
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:02.040
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.360
I am disappointed.

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:08.640
But not because
you didn't find it.

1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:13.960
But because you did.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:17.200
And you lied.

1:08:34.280 --> 1:08:35.400
GAMORA: Nebula.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:44.000
Don't do this.

1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:45.360
THANOS: Some time ago,

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:48.160
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:49.320
Please don't do this.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:51.720
THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:53.840
So I brought her here.

1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:56.640
To talk.

1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:06.680
Stop. Stop it.

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.920
I swear to you on my life.

1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:17.680
I never found the Soul Stone.

1:09:21.840 --> 1:09:23.400
NEBULA:
Accessing memory files.

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:24.920
You know
what he's about to do.

1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:27.680
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:28.960
-All of them.
-He can never get them all.

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:30.080
NEBULA: He will!

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.120
He can't, Nebula.

1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:34.640
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:37.600
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.440
You're strong.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.480
Me.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:51.640
You're generous.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000
Me.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.400
But I never taught you to lie.

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:01.200
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:07.960
Where is the Soul Stone?

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:26.360
Vormir!

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:46.080
The stone is on Vormir.

1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.840
Show me.

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:55.000
GROOT: I am Groot.

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:56.280
ROCKET: Tinkle in the cup.

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:57.720
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:00.040
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:01.280
I am Groot.

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:02.520
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.080
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:05.600
You speak Groot?

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:07.560
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:08.760
I am Groot.

1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:10.920
You'll know when we're close.

1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:12.680
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.960
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:19.840
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:22.280
It's truly awesome.

1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.440
Okay, time to be the captain.

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:38.000
So, dead brother, huh?

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:40.520
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.880
Well, he's been dead before.

1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:46.880
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:49.680
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:51.160
Both dead.

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:53.440
But still got a mom, though?

1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:55.200
Killed by a dark elf.

1:11:55.360 --> 1:11:56.360
A best friend?

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:57.800
Stabbed through the heart.

1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:04.360
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:08.080
Absolutely.

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:11.760
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:13.520
they're all
tremendous motivators.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:14.600
They really clear the mind.

1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.360
So I'm good to go.

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:19.200
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:21.960
he's the toughest there is.

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.160
-Well, he's never fought me.
-Yeah, he has.

1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:25.880
He's never fought me twice.

1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:28.280
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:30.680
It better be some hammer.

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:37.200
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:39.920
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:42.040
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:43.120
but none succeeded.

1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:46.720
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:49.680
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.720
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:53.680
Fate wills it so.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:55.080
Mmm-hmm.

1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:57.000
And what if you're wrong?

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.080
If I'm wrong, then...

1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:04.920
what more could I lose?

1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:20.120
I could lose a lot.

1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:22.320
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:27.120
Okay.

1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:32.280
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:34.160
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:36.320
-What's this?
-What's it look like?

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.080
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:40.520
He gave you his eye?

1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:41.800
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.920
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.080
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:49.160
Hmm.

1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:53.240
Huh?

1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.080
Oh.

1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:59.080
I would've washed that.

1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:01.640
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.080
Hey, we're here!

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.200
I don't think
this thing works.

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:10.520
Everything seems dark.

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.720
ROCKET: It ain't the eye.

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:29.440
Something's wrong.

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:31.760
The star's gone out.

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:34.160
And the rings are frozen.

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:56.800
ROCKET: I hope
these dwarves are better

1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.640
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:05.480
Maybe they realized
that they live

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:06.960
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:10.080
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:15.000
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:16.360
THOR: Yes, why?

1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:18.560
ROCKET: It look
anything like that?

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.720
I am Groot.

1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.400
Go back to the pod.

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:30.440
Eitri, wait!

1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:32.440
Stop!

1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:34.360
Stop.

1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:36.080
Thor?

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:40.800
What happened here?

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.520
You were supposed
to protect us.

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:47.040
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.440
Asgard is destroyed.

1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:55.520
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:11.280
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:15.560
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:19.520
I made what he wanted.

1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:25.600
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:32.720
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:36.600
All except me.

1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:39.560
"Your life is yours," he said.

1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:44.800
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:47.760
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:50.480
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:52.000
every axe, hammer, sword...

1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:54.360
it's all inside your head.

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:57.160
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1:16:57.320 --> 1:16:58.880
Trust me, I know.

1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:04.040
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.

1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:46.840
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.200
I need you
to meet me on Titan.

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:56.880
SPIDER-MAN:
Hey, what's going on?

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:58.240
DR. STRANGE:
I think we're here.

1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:00.880
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:04.200
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:05.320
Close those around it.

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:08.000
-You understand?
-Yep, got it.

1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:09.480
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta

1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:11.240
-move at the same time.
-Okay, okay. Ready.

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:16.880
-We might wanna turn.

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:18.280
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:49.720
You all right?

1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:52.480
That was close.

1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.120
I owe you one.

1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:57.680
Let me just say, if aliens

1:18:57.760 --> 1:18:59.520
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:00.840
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.320
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1:19:03.400 --> 1:19:05.000
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:06.520
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:15.040
DRAX: Thanos!

1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:37.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:41.840
-PETER QUILL: Stay down, clown.

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:49.120
DRAX: Die, blanket of death!

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:57.960
PETER: Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:01.160
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

1:20:01.920 --> 1:20:03.160
Where is Gamora?

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:05.840
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

1:20:06.120 --> 1:20:08.920
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?

1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:11.000
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:12.360
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:15.360
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:18.520
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:20.680
-No, he can't take it!
-She's right. You can't.

1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.920
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:24.120
I'll kill all three of you

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:26.040
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:27.200
Starting with you.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:28.360
Wait, what, Thanos?

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:30.520
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:32.720
What master do you serve?

1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:34.120
What master do I serve?

1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:35.680
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:37.640
You're from Earth.

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:38.760
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:40.160
STARK: Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:41.360
What are you hassling us for?

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:43.280
SPIDER-MAN: So you're not
with Thanos?

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:45.600
With Thanos?

1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:48.760
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:50.760
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:53.320
-We're the Avengers, man.
-Oh.

1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:55.680
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:57.040
You know Thor?

1:20:57.200 --> 1:20:58.280
Yeah.

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.800
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.640
Where is he now?

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:19.600
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:20.960
It's a mold.

1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:22.720
A king's weapon.

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:26.000
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:29.520
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:31.120
Did it have a name?

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:33.560
Stormbreaker.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:35.160
That's a bit much.

1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:38.280
So how do we make it?

1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:42.320
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:45.480
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.760
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:56.360
PETER: The hell happened
to this planet?

1:21:56.560 --> 1:21:58.320
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.640
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:04.760
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:08.360
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:09.760
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.280
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:12.560
pin him down,
get what we need.

1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:14.400
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:15.520
We just want the gauntlet.

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:18.480
-Are you yawning?
-

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:20.720
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:21.840
Did you hear what I said?

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.960
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:26.200
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:29.200
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:30.880
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:32.600
Kick names, take ass.

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:34.040
Yeah, that's right.

1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:42.080
All right, just get over here,
please.

1:22:42.520 --> 1:22:44.400
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.760
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:50.760
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.560
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:55.000
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:56.360
We don't know what it means.

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.360
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:02.000
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:04.080
and that way
it might be really good.

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.200
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:08.480
-STARK: What dance-off?
- It's nothing.

1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:09.680
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:11.240
Exactly like Footloose.

1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.280
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:14.560
SPIDER-MAN: It never was.

1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:15.800
STARK: Don't encourage this,
all right?

1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:17.160
-Okay.
-We're getting no help

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.840
-from Flash Gordon here.
-Flash Gordon?

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:20.040
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:22.120
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:23.840
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:26.040
that's 100% you.

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.480
STARK: Your math
is blowing my mind.

1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:28.840
MANTIS: Excuse me.

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:33.280
But does your friend
often do that?

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.960
Strange, we all right?

1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:48.320
You're back. You're all right.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:50.200
-DR. STRANGE: Hi.
-Hey, what was that?

1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:54.360
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1:23:55.240 --> 1:23:56.800
To see all
the possible outcomes

1:23:56.880 --> 1:23:58.720
of the coming conflict.

1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:00.800
How many did you see?

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:03.200
14,000,605.

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:06.280
How many did we win?

1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:12.200
One.

1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:37.120
THANOS: The stone
had better be up there.

1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.040
For your sister's sake.

1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:06.680
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.040
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:13.360
THANOS: You know us?

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:18.080
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:20.240
Where is the Soul Stone?

1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:22.640
You should know...

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.400
it extracts a terrible price.

1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:29.320
I am prepared.

1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:34.200
We all think that at first.

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:41.040
We are all wrong.

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:55.000
THANOS: How is it you know
this place so well?

1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:59.480
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:02.640
I even held one in my hand.

1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:06.880
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:11.080
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:22.720
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:25.800
As does what you fear.

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:28.000
What's this?

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.080
RED SKULL: The price.

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.880
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:39.960
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:43.160
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.880
RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:49.600
understands its power...

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.280
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:56.000
Of what?

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:58.400
In order to take the stone,

1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:00.880
you must lose
that which you love.

1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:05.120
A soul...

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:07.000
for a soul.

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:25.080
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:27.400
a moment...

1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.840
when you got
what you deserved.

1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:35.320
And I was always
so disappointed.

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.400
But now...

1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:47.440
You kill and torture...

1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:51.400
and you call it mercy.

1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:57.560
The universe has judged you.

1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:03.600
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.640
You failed.

1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:09.920
And do you wanna know why?

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.720
Because you love nothing.

1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:15.040
No one.

1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:21.840
No.

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:27.480
Really?

1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:29.600
Tears?

1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.360
They're not for him.

1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:47.840
GAMORA: No.

1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:50.760
This isn't love.

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:54.280
I ignored my destiny once.

1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:58.920
I cannot do that again.

1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:02.800
Even for you.

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.360
I'm sorry, little one.

1:29:33.200 --> 1:29:34.440
No!

1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:14.880
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:16.320
I hope you're right
about this.

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:19.360
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.
