10:59.659 --> 11:01.535
Uh, sorry!
That's my fault.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.329

back at the bistro.

a little less lonely

E-Everyone?

I call it Gaia.

An artist.

also talk process.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.889

there's a way

12:03.973 --> 12:06.642
for me to feel less like shit
at the end of every day.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.812
There is, and that's actually
why I brought you out here --

12:09.895 --> 12:11.689
to tell you you're fired.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.190
-You're fired.
-What?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.276
-Why?
-Let's go alphabetically.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.944
"A" is for albatross.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.821
You're an albatross
around my neck.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.906
"B" is for bore.
You bore me.

12:20.990 --> 12:21.991
That's an easy one.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.659
"P" for puke-inducing,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.912
"Q" for quick-to-make-me-barf,
"R" for rascal.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.206
Well, that's -- that's the one
thing I do like about you.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.875
You're kind of a rascal.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.171
You fired Klaus?!

12:35.254 --> 12:36.380
Yeah, but not for reals.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.715
Just to break his heart.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.966
It's all part of my process.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.384
Your process?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.219
Yeah, I torture Klaus,
crush his spirit,

Spaghetti Night!

19:23.662 --> 19:25.455
Pretty awesome, right?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.124
The eyes.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.209
-They're dead.
-They're meatballs!

19:29.293 --> 19:33.088
I think it's cool because
it's a statue of you...Dad.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.423
You're an imbecile, Brandon.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.133
Klaus!

19:36.216 --> 19:38.719
There's no depth, no pathos.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.429
It sucks!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.806
I'm not this corny-ass
Mr. Rogers.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.976
Uh-oh. That's a quarter
for the swear jar, Klaus.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.187
Here's 50 cents.
Go buy some new tits!

19:48.270 --> 19:49.646
Excuse me?!

19:49.730 --> 19:52.149
You did this to me!
We're finished!

19:52.232 --> 19:54.026
Brandon, why did you even
bring a football?!

19:54.109 --> 19:57.029
It's an art gallery!
I hate you!

19:57.112 --> 20:00.782
I hate you!

20:00.866 --> 20:03.035
I hate myself!

20:05.412 --> 20:06.663
There he is!

20:06.747 --> 20:08.498
There's the Klaus I know
and love!

20:08.582 --> 20:09.833
I knew the misery

20:09.917 --> 20:11.168
was still inside you!

20:11.251 --> 20:12.794
You obviously didn't know when

20:12.878 --> 20:14.671
you squeezed out this turd.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.381
Oh, didn't I?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.054
It's me.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.972
The real me.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.307
Thank you, Roger.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.561
I am your muse, now and forever.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.105
Yes!
We're back, old friend!

20:32.189 --> 20:33.649
But about that --
we're not back.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.276
I've given up art
to follow my true passion --

20:36.360 --> 20:37.361
doing heroin.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.905
We're back, old friend!

20:41.782 --> 20:43.075
Denise?

20:43.158 --> 20:44.743
Ah, she headed out.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.412
Dad, this was a great idea.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.664
Well, it would
have been a shame

20:48.747 --> 20:50.582
making the thousand-mile
journey home

20:50.666 --> 20:52.209
without rampaging something.

20:52.292 --> 20:55.671
Feast, Killdozer!
Feast!

20:58.131 --> 20:59.591
Why?

20:59.675 --> 21:01.426
Then again, why not?

21:02.552 --> 21:03.971
Have a great night!
