03:07.833 --> 03:09.041
Attack!

03:09.666 --> 03:11.083
Attack!

03:12.291 --> 03:15.750
-Go! Come on! Get out there!
-To the ladders!

03:16.333 --> 03:17.333
Get out!

03:18.166 --> 03:21.000
Heinrich, come on, move! Let's go!

03:21.083 --> 03:22.625
To the ladders!

03:22.708 --> 03:24.291
On my command!

03:24.375 --> 03:25.458
-Charge!
-Hans?

03:27.625 --> 03:30.041
Attack! Get out there!

03:30.125 --> 03:32.458
Go! Charge!

03:35.291 --> 03:38.666
-Hans?
-Go, Heinrich! Get out there!

03:39.875 --> 03:40.875
Attack!

03:44.750 --> 03:46.125
Keep going!

03:46.750 --> 03:47.916
Keep going!

03:57.166 --> 03:58.458
Faster! Go! Faster!

04:07.333 --> 04:08.333
Take cover!

04:13.333 --> 04:14.333
Heinrich!

04:17.458 --> 04:18.666
Heinrich!

05:08.250 --> 05:14.208
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

08:15.500 --> 08:19.666
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

08:21.333 --> 08:24.500
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

08:43.208 --> 08:44.750
-Paul!
-Paul!

08:47.750 --> 08:48.875
Paul. Hey.

08:49.541 --> 08:50.750
Well?

08:52.416 --> 08:54.375
-So, what now?
-Don't know.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.375
-Does he know we're all going?
-Of course.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.458
You're staying home?

08:58.541 --> 09:01.041
My God, staying tied
to your mummy's apron-strings?

09:02.791 --> 09:04.166
Here, I'll sign it for you.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.333
-His parents have to do that.
-But they didn't. Give it here.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.583
-It won't work. They'll find out.
-How?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.625
How? Are they pen pals with his father?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.458
-Give me your pen.
-I don't have one.

09:19.583 --> 09:20.833
Ludwig.

09:20.916 --> 09:23.125
You'll be in trouble.
You'll get a thrashing.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.291
Got a better idea?
I won't be the only one left behind.

09:39.833 --> 09:40.666
Yeah!

09:41.791 --> 09:44.833
Congratulations, Private Bäumer.
You're going to the front.

09:44.916 --> 09:46.083
I'm a dead man.

09:48.125 --> 09:51.458
You're standing here
on the threshold of existence.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.375
Remember this moment.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.708
It's an important moment.

09:57.791 --> 10:03.416
In years to come, you will be judged
on what you dared to become today.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.916
The Iron Youth of Germany.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.458
My friends,

10:08.541 --> 10:11.208
you are fortunate
to be living in great times.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.750
Your deeds will be the water

10:13.833 --> 10:17.125
that will nourish a strong and noble root.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.625
Stand still and listen, Leinemann!

10:19.708 --> 10:21.875
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

10:24.250 --> 10:28.625
I am sure that I will see most of you
here at home again soon,

10:29.708 --> 10:32.750
your sword returned
to its scabbard with honour.

10:33.791 --> 10:37.125
With an Iron Cross
pinned to your proud chest.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.541
But don't be fooled.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.416
During the darkest hours out there
as you await an attack,

10:45.166 --> 10:47.458
you may start to harbour doubts.

10:48.708 --> 10:51.458
But this is no time for weakness of mind!

10:52.166 --> 10:56.333
Any wavering, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the Fatherland!

10:57.750 --> 11:00.625
Modern warfare is like a game of chess.

11:00.708 --> 11:04.541
It's never about the individual.
It's always about the whole.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.541
You will prove yourselves
worthy of your uniforms

11:10.375 --> 11:13.166
and break through
the enemy front in Flanders.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.708
And then, in just a few weeks,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.958
you will finally march on Paris!

11:20.041 --> 11:21.708
-Yes!
-Yes!

11:21.791 --> 11:23.041
Our future,

11:23.750 --> 11:25.333
the future of Germany,

11:26.541 --> 11:29.166
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

11:30.375 --> 11:32.833
My friends, that's you!

11:32.916 --> 11:33.875
Yes!

11:33.958 --> 11:35.916
So, off to battle!

11:36.000 --> 11:39.083
For Kaiser, God and Fatherland!

11:39.166 --> 11:41.250
Yes!

11:42.708 --> 11:44.791
-Bravo!
-Yes!

11:52.166 --> 11:53.166
Next.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.083
Next.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.833
Next.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.333
Next.

12:00.541 --> 12:01.375
Next.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.416
Bäumer, Paul. 53 Wiesengrund.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.666
Born 18th November '99.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.708
-Correct?
-Yes, sir.

12:13.875 --> 12:14.875
Next.

12:16.125 --> 12:16.958
Paul?

12:18.875 --> 12:21.291
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.875
-Yes.
-Next.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.875
Everything all right?

12:26.958 --> 12:29.541
-Yes, I just want to get going at last.
-Next.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.458
Off you go.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.583
Next.

12:35.833 --> 12:36.833
Excuse me.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.250
This belongs to someone.

12:38.958 --> 12:39.791
Next.

12:40.458 --> 12:44.083
Yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.791
Here. Take care.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.583
Thank you.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.416
Blimey, as if they were tailor-made!

13:08.333 --> 13:10.916
Well, Ludwig,
are you going to get all the girls now?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.875
As long as you don't shoot us.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.041
<i>Girl, I do love you</i>

13:19.125 --> 13:22.250
<i>But I can't marry you just yet</i>

13:22.333 --> 13:24.875
<i>Wait another year</i>
<i>Then it will…</i>

13:24.958 --> 13:26.291
She won't wait, Franz.

13:27.958 --> 13:28.875
She won't wait.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.333
You ladykiller, you.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.583
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

13:43.666 --> 13:46.916
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:50.791
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

13:50.875 --> 13:54.041
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

13:55.083 --> 13:58.291
<i>Girl, I do love you</i>

13:58.833 --> 14:02.083
<i>But I can't marry you just yet</i>

14:02.666 --> 14:06.250
<i>Wait another year</i>
<i>Then it will come true</i>

14:06.333 --> 14:09.625
<i>Wait another year</i>
<i>Then it will come true…</i>

14:17.583 --> 14:21.500
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

14:33.416 --> 14:35.041
What's your name, soldier?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.250
Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.166
Do you like dirty girls, Kropp?

14:41.791 --> 14:43.791
Do you like dirty girls?

14:45.291 --> 14:47.125
No, sir.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.125
Why did you sleep with one then?

14:49.833 --> 14:51.708
Report for guard duty at 3 a.m.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in an absolute shithole.

14:55.916 --> 14:59.208
And you'd better do it with a clean G98.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.208
You'll pamper it.

15:01.875 --> 15:02.916
You'll love it.

15:03.958 --> 15:07.333
And damn it, you'll keep it as spotless
as the Holy Virgin's thighs.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.916
-Do we understand each other?
-Yes, sir!

15:11.000 --> 15:13.791
Welcome
to the 78th Infantry Reserve Regiment.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.125
We're on the Western Front now.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.666
Welcome to Paris!

15:20.750 --> 15:21.583
Yes!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.166
Damn it, what happened?

15:53.666 --> 15:56.375
I have to deliver the company
to the front by 6 p.m.

15:56.458 --> 15:59.583
You can, but on foot.
We need the trucks, Lieutenant.

15:59.666 --> 16:03.458
-With all due respect, my orders…
-You can stick your orders up your arse!

16:03.541 --> 16:06.875
I've got 40 men here dying in the mud.
Get out right now!

16:09.666 --> 16:11.000
Everyone out!

16:12.583 --> 16:14.291
Come on. Make it snappy.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.958
You heard the staff surgeon.

16:19.041 --> 16:22.250
Faster, soldiers! Don't fall asleep here!

16:25.583 --> 16:26.708
Come on!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.625
-Franz Müller, right?
-Yes.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.958
The commander-in-chief expects you
to survive at least six weeks.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.500
-Do you want to be alive in six weeks?
-Yes, sir.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.625
Then stop dragging your feet
and get a move on!

16:45.291 --> 16:46.833
-Did you hear me?
-Yes.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.250
Hurry up!

16:49.833 --> 16:51.458
We're not at a tea dance!

16:58.291 --> 16:59.875
Gas!

17:00.625 --> 17:02.500
-Gas!
-Gas!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.666
Gas!

17:04.750 --> 17:05.958
Gas!

17:07.250 --> 17:08.833
Gas masks on!

17:08.916 --> 17:11.833
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.166
If the French could aim better,

17:14.250 --> 17:18.750
they'd be scraping us off the road now
with a spoon and burying us in a mess tin.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.416
But one thing is as sure as eggs is eggs.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.416
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

17:27.458 --> 17:28.958
Eyes front!

17:43.208 --> 17:45.666
-Have you got cloth ears?
-No, sir.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.416
I was just trying to put on my mask.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.500
You, Paul Bäumer,
will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

18:00.541 --> 18:02.541
You should eat something, damn it.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.208
Attention! Gas masks off!

18:06.708 --> 18:08.333
Gas masks off!

18:08.416 --> 18:11.958
Not you. You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.375
With that bonehead there.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.625
Line up! March!

18:18.458 --> 18:21.291
Stick together and get moving!

18:22.375 --> 18:24.458
Come on, hurry up!

18:42.166 --> 18:45.416
Paul! Paul, come on.
Give me your backpack.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.250
You can carry mine next time.

18:59.166 --> 19:01.250
Congratulations, soldiers.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.250
This is your new home.

19:03.333 --> 19:04.250
Helmets off!

19:05.625 --> 19:08.375
I see the men have been enjoying
my absence, Steinberger.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.250
There was gunfire all night.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.583
Their nerves are shot.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.583
Dry boots are a good remedy for that.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.833
Do you want us all to drown?

19:15.916 --> 19:18.458
Everyone pitches in! Bail out the trench.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.250
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

19:26.958 --> 19:28.666
Why are you still standing around?

19:31.166 --> 19:32.833
Throw a dog a bone,

19:34.375 --> 19:35.791
it will always snap it up.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.083
Give a man power…

19:43.208 --> 19:44.250
Man is a beast.

19:45.833 --> 19:46.833
Drink.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.166
Katczinsky, come over here. Lend a hand.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.333
We'll get hit hard tonight.

20:30.041 --> 20:30.916
Sorry.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.208
Forget about it.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.958
This isn't how I imagined it.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.541
Shut up, Ludwig.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.250
Stick them down your trousers.
That's what I always do.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.583
You think that will make it shoot better?

21:49.083 --> 21:50.583
-Did you hear that?
-What?

21:52.375 --> 21:53.375
That sound. Listen.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.000
There's nothing there.

22:05.583 --> 22:06.833
Our first Frenchmen.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.625
Calm down, Paulie.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.666
I hear it now too.

22:26.708 --> 22:27.916
Who's there?

22:29.333 --> 22:30.541
Hey.

22:32.875 --> 22:33.875
Show yourself!

22:52.500 --> 22:53.333
No!

22:53.416 --> 22:56.333
I got hit!

22:57.083 --> 22:59.458
-No, Paul. No.
-What's going on there?

22:59.541 --> 23:00.541
Oh, no.

23:07.958 --> 23:08.958
What is it?

23:09.625 --> 23:11.541
They shot at me from over there.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.125
They saw your muzzle flash.

23:21.375 --> 23:22.666
Keep your heads down.

23:22.750 --> 23:26.291
Unless you want to catch the next bullet
with your teeth, move ten metres.

23:26.375 --> 23:29.125
Shoot, then move.
Shoot, then move. Understood?

23:30.875 --> 23:31.708
Yes.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.041
Come on.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.958
Take cover!

24:44.000 --> 24:45.083
In here!

24:45.958 --> 24:48.333
Bäumer, Kropp! You two, in here. Quick!

24:49.041 --> 24:49.916
In the bunker!

24:53.000 --> 24:55.208
Get in!

25:14.208 --> 25:15.458
"Watch what you eat."

25:16.333 --> 25:17.958
That's what my mother said.

25:21.416 --> 25:23.125
-We'll stick together, Paul.
-Yeah.

25:23.208 --> 25:24.791
-We'll stick together.
-Yeah.

25:26.708 --> 25:29.583
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I want to go home.

25:30.166 --> 25:31.250
I want to go home.

25:52.458 --> 25:53.750
Creeping barrage.

25:57.083 --> 25:58.208
What?

25:59.458 --> 26:02.458
Every few minutes,
the artillery barrage moves forward,

26:03.625 --> 26:05.000
and directly behind it,

26:05.958 --> 26:07.583
the infantry advances.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.458
What does that mean?

26:11.208 --> 26:12.208
They're coming.

26:33.208 --> 26:35.500
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.750
The barrage is nearly over.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.041
-No. Let me go.
-Calm down.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.625
-Let me out. I want to get out of here.
-Calm down!

26:45.083 --> 26:46.083
Calm down.

26:50.541 --> 26:51.375
No!

26:55.875 --> 26:57.375
Get out!

26:57.458 --> 26:58.916
Get out!

27:05.208 --> 27:06.500
Move! Get out!

27:06.583 --> 27:07.750
Get out of here!

27:07.833 --> 27:09.041
Everyone, get out!

28:01.041 --> 28:02.500
Paul. That's Paul.

28:02.583 --> 28:03.750
Albert!

28:03.833 --> 28:05.666
Albert, we've found Paul!

28:08.000 --> 28:09.708
We have to move that beam.

28:12.791 --> 28:13.625
Paul.

28:14.416 --> 28:15.250
Paul.

28:17.708 --> 28:18.708
Are you okay?

28:19.875 --> 28:21.000
Are you okay, Paul?

28:22.000 --> 28:24.291
Come on. Paul, come on. I'll help you.

28:24.875 --> 28:27.208
Come on. Up you come. Sit down.

28:27.291 --> 28:28.833
-Are you injured?
-Keep going.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.041
Paul, are you injured?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.166
-Can you hear me?
-Albert Kropp, we need help!

28:32.250 --> 28:34.375
-See you later, Paul.
-See you later, Paul.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.666
Katczinsky, get on with it!

29:53.750 --> 29:55.708
And you? Are you injured?

29:55.791 --> 29:56.625
No.

29:57.125 --> 29:58.250
Then start collecting.

29:58.916 --> 30:00.416
Oh, man!

30:10.166 --> 30:11.291
Hard work pays off.

33:07.541 --> 33:09.666
Come on! Keep moving now!

33:10.166 --> 33:11.750
We haven't got all day.

34:26.250 --> 34:27.916
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.625
18 MONTHS LATER

34:29.708 --> 34:33.708
14th September 1898.

34:37.666 --> 34:40.708
Blumenthal, Samuel.

34:41.791 --> 34:45.708
Dresden, 6th November 1900.

34:46.916 --> 34:48.416
It was his birthday yesterday.

34:51.875 --> 34:54.333
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

34:55.416 --> 34:59.791
Osnabrück, 20th June '99.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.666
Götz Lüttwitz…

35:02.750 --> 35:03.625
That's enough.

35:13.291 --> 35:18.541
GERMAN HIGH COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER 1918

35:41.541 --> 35:42.625
Mr. Erzberger.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.333
May God be with us.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.375
Again more than 40,000 dead
in the last weeks alone.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.250
That should convince the general staff.

36:02.791 --> 36:05.000
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.500
We all know.

36:13.916 --> 36:15.041
The Field Marshal.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.041
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

37:01.458 --> 37:02.791
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

37:15.791 --> 37:19.666
If we keep up this pace, Paul,
we'll have conquered France in 180 years.

37:20.833 --> 37:22.041
I worked it out.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.125
Don't get caught, Kat.

37:27.333 --> 37:28.625
Never.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.166
Listen.

37:42.208 --> 37:44.833
What do you think, Paul?
Is it worth dying for?

37:46.458 --> 37:48.166
It is when you're hungry.

38:45.916 --> 38:46.916
Kat?

38:49.541 --> 38:50.375
Kat?

38:51.875 --> 38:52.708
Run!

38:52.791 --> 38:54.125
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

38:54.958 --> 38:55.791
Run!

39:16.875 --> 39:19.166
Men, you're heroes.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.375
Shut the door,
or the others will smell it.

39:24.250 --> 39:27.041
-Password.
-I don't know. I've forgotten everything.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.958
-Use your Prussian brain.
-Here. Eyes wide, long fingers.

39:30.041 --> 39:31.833
-Exactly.
-Mouth open, goose in.

39:31.916 --> 39:34.875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From Franz to Franz.

39:34.958 --> 39:35.958
I'll have a wing.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.958
Do I have to share? I'll have the rest.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.041
Well, in with it!

39:40.250 --> 39:43.166
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouthed frog.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.708
-May we rest in peace under the barrage.
-Oh, God.

39:46.708 --> 39:49.625
Oh, God.
Hey, boys, I'll never forget this.

40:16.416 --> 40:17.583
Does it taste good?

40:18.500 --> 40:19.333
Yes.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.375
-And you?
-Yes, good.

40:25.458 --> 40:26.500
Good, Paul?

40:26.583 --> 40:27.458
Good, Kat.

40:27.541 --> 40:28.458
Life is short.

40:29.416 --> 40:33.625
Where's Emil when you need him?
Emil, bring over the coffee and caviar!

40:33.708 --> 40:36.083
Yes, and run a foot bath.
I need a foot bath.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.375
Kat?

40:38.875 --> 40:39.750
What is it?

40:41.125 --> 40:44.416
<i>You stole the goose</i>
<i>Give it back</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:46.291
<i>Give it back</i>

40:46.375 --> 40:48.291
<i>-Or the hunter will get you…</i>
-The farmer!

40:48.375 --> 40:49.750
The farmer! Yes!

40:49.833 --> 40:56.291
<i>Or the farmer will get you</i>
<i>With his rifle…</i>

41:21.458 --> 41:25.916
Tjaden sits very quietly and says,
"All I ever hear about is crosses."

41:26.000 --> 41:28.083
"My father was Captain of Nazareth."

41:28.916 --> 41:30.916
"Captain of Nazareth?" asks the teacher.

41:31.625 --> 41:35.083
"Never heard of it.
Tjaden, go home and ask again, okay?"

41:35.583 --> 41:38.958
The next morning,
Tjaden rushes into the classroom and says,

41:39.041 --> 41:42.291
"I'm so sorry,
my father wasn't Captain of Nazareth."

41:42.833 --> 41:44.958
"My father had the clap in a lazaret."

41:50.750 --> 41:52.375
Tjaden didn't even go to school.

41:55.541 --> 41:56.375
Look!

42:20.708 --> 42:21.791
Hey! Hello!

42:23.083 --> 42:24.083
Come here!

42:25.000 --> 42:26.208
Fresh baguette!

42:27.208 --> 42:28.125
For you!

42:28.791 --> 42:30.208
Leberwurst, love!

42:30.708 --> 42:31.875
Lots of love!

42:46.291 --> 42:47.916
Hey, Franz, where are you going?

42:49.125 --> 42:51.250
-Take me with you!
-Come on then!

42:58.208 --> 42:59.083
Look!

42:59.583 --> 43:01.500
Now he's making a fool of himself.

43:02.458 --> 43:05.958
Ooh la la! You're very beautiful, my love.

43:07.375 --> 43:08.208
Franz!

43:08.291 --> 43:10.125
The skinny dark-haired one is mine!

43:20.125 --> 43:21.583
Where's he going now?

43:27.166 --> 43:28.000
Franz?

43:28.750 --> 43:30.250
Goodbye!

43:30.875 --> 43:32.125
Goodbye, my friends!

43:44.333 --> 43:45.375
Damn.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.500
If it was all over now,
you know what I'd do?

43:50.583 --> 43:52.333
There's no peace. It's not over.

43:52.416 --> 43:53.416
But if it was.

43:54.125 --> 43:57.208
-Bloody hell, there'd be girls again.
-Yes, indeed.

43:58.125 --> 44:00.583
I wouldn't wear any trousers for a week.

44:00.666 --> 44:03.833
I should smack your arses
for bringing that up.

44:03.916 --> 44:05.000
What about you, Paul?

44:06.500 --> 44:10.083
-No idea. Can't think of anything.
-I'd stay with the Prussians.

44:10.166 --> 44:11.416
You're crazy, Tjaden.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.875
Have you ever dug peat?

44:13.958 --> 44:14.958
Try it one day.

44:15.041 --> 44:17.083
Can't be worse than digging trenches.

44:17.166 --> 44:20.583
Takes longer than digging trenches.
And you can't slack off either.

44:21.833 --> 44:24.583
In the army during peacetime,
you have no worries.

44:25.083 --> 44:27.541
Food's there every morning,
or you raise a stink.

44:28.250 --> 44:31.458
Then you've got your nice bed,
fresh sheets every week.

44:31.958 --> 44:32.791
And then…

44:34.500 --> 44:36.125
Then you make NCO.

44:37.083 --> 44:40.166
Imagine that. I'll be a police ranger.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.583
A cognac here, a pint there.

44:42.666 --> 44:45.250
Everyone wants to be friends
with a ranger. Everyone.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.000
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

44:48.375 --> 44:49.416
What's that?

44:50.000 --> 44:51.583
You'll never make NCO.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.416
You always ask such nonsense questions.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.041
It won't change anything.

45:21.333 --> 45:23.000
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

45:23.083 --> 45:24.125
-Kat!
-Here!

46:21.375 --> 46:22.375
"My dumpling."

46:23.250 --> 46:25.833
"You asked for a food parcel."

46:25.916 --> 46:28.833
"Four helpings of wurst
and lard are on their way…

46:31.166 --> 46:33.083
a few cakes,

46:34.208 --> 46:35.916
sauerkraut and bockwurst,

46:36.958 --> 46:37.791
and…

46:38.916 --> 46:39.833
Hing…

46:39.916 --> 46:42.166
Hingfong essence with sugar cubes,

46:43.666 --> 46:46.083
some eggs and a jar of plum jam."

46:46.916 --> 46:50.166
"Make it last because I don't want
to have to send more too soon."

46:50.875 --> 46:52.958
"Better not share it with your comrades."

46:54.458 --> 46:57.666
"My dear dumpling,
I have another question for you."

46:58.458 --> 47:00.416
"How much money have you saved so far?"

47:01.375 --> 47:03.250
"Can you maybe send some home?"

47:04.208 --> 47:07.041
"They say that the war will be over soon,

47:07.666 --> 47:09.833
so it would be good
to have some left over."

47:11.000 --> 47:14.500
"Now you'll think,
listen to the old lady, how cheeky!"

47:15.375 --> 47:16.791
"But no offence."

47:17.416 --> 47:19.666
"You know me, I can't get enough."

47:20.250 --> 47:22.625
"Give me an inch and I'll take a mile."

47:23.541 --> 47:25.666
"So don't keel over on the home stretch."

47:27.625 --> 47:31.000
"Karl Lemmer is already
in a field hospital in the East."

47:31.500 --> 47:35.333
"Something to do with his stomach.
He was hardly out there three weeks."

47:36.958 --> 47:39.416
"Can't you get off too,
with your rheumatism?"

47:40.833 --> 47:42.333
"You've done your bit."

47:44.291 --> 47:47.250
If only she could see you now,
sitting here with your cigar!

47:51.458 --> 47:52.958
"On Sunday, I'm visiting…"

47:59.666 --> 48:02.500
"On Sunday,
I'm visiting our little boy's grave."

48:05.708 --> 48:09.041
"I'm going to read to him.
He always liked that so much."

48:10.916 --> 48:14.625
"Next year, we'll go together
and celebrate his tenth birthday."

48:17.125 --> 48:19.041
"Well, that's all I had to say."

48:19.583 --> 48:21.708
"Kisses from your wife."

48:22.541 --> 48:23.500
"Goodbye."

48:29.958 --> 48:30.958
I didn't know.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.666
Oh, Paul.

48:46.916 --> 48:48.291
What's going to happen?

48:50.250 --> 48:51.583
Going home someday…

48:53.000 --> 48:54.583
Going back to our old lives.

48:56.083 --> 48:59.083
And all they'll want to know is
if we fought in close combat.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.250
We'll walk around like travellers
in a landscape from the past.

49:08.458 --> 49:09.625
I ask myself…

49:11.833 --> 49:15.166
if I wouldn't just rather
sit around a campfire with you

49:15.708 --> 49:16.958
and Tjaden and Kropp

49:18.250 --> 49:20.041
and Müller…

49:21.875 --> 49:23.250
and eat fried potatoes.

49:24.166 --> 49:25.416
With the skin on.

49:32.083 --> 49:33.125
Yeah…

49:44.875 --> 49:45.833
I'm bored.

49:49.375 --> 49:51.083
How long until we get going again?

49:51.958 --> 49:53.666
How long until we get going again?

50:13.333 --> 50:14.166
Franz?

50:15.166 --> 50:16.000
Yeah?

50:17.458 --> 50:20.875
We have to leave at six tomorrow.
To look for some kids.

50:21.708 --> 50:22.708
What happened?

50:24.041 --> 50:25.625
They should have arrived today.

50:26.291 --> 50:27.500
An entire company.

50:32.250 --> 50:33.500
How was it?

50:37.416 --> 50:38.541
-Nice.
-Yeah?

50:39.500 --> 50:40.333
Yeah.

50:42.666 --> 50:43.500
Here.

50:48.958 --> 50:49.833
Smell.

51:02.375 --> 51:03.333
What's her name?

51:03.833 --> 51:04.833
Eloise.

51:07.708 --> 51:08.583
Eloise.

51:09.583 --> 51:12.250
Her skin was as white as milk.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.666
And her breasts…

51:18.250 --> 51:19.083
Hey.

51:20.125 --> 51:21.041
I want a turn.

51:23.708 --> 51:25.458
Albert.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.333
-Kropp. Let me have it.
-Here.

51:27.416 --> 51:29.583
-Oh, my!
-Tjaden.

51:29.666 --> 51:32.541
A girl like that never has
dirty fingernails.

51:32.625 --> 51:35.208
-No.
-At most, a bit of sand from the beach.

51:35.791 --> 51:36.958
Tjaden.

51:37.041 --> 51:40.291
-Come on, give it to me.
-I'm sure she has a bath twice a day.

51:42.291 --> 51:43.250
Tjaden.

51:43.958 --> 51:46.166
Please. It's mine.

51:46.750 --> 51:48.958
-Tjaden!
-No, it's mine now.

52:50.791 --> 52:52.291
That was one hell of a blast.

52:53.416 --> 52:54.416
Trench mortar.

52:55.541 --> 52:57.583
It blasted him right out of his uniform.

53:03.125 --> 53:05.250
Is he one of those we're looking for?

53:05.333 --> 53:07.583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

53:08.583 --> 53:09.875
He's been up there a while.

53:11.250 --> 53:12.166
Not funny.

53:12.958 --> 53:14.458
Don't start getting soft, men.

53:15.083 --> 53:18.041
-How many are we looking for?
-Sixty young recruits.

53:25.541 --> 53:28.916
Turnip bread for breakfast.
Turnip bread for lunch.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.583
Turnip bread all the time.
I've had enough.

53:32.166 --> 53:35.041
Tell me when you've found them.
I'm not taking another step.

53:35.916 --> 53:36.750
Gas.

53:40.083 --> 53:41.166
There was gas here.

54:23.750 --> 54:24.666
Yes.

55:00.791 --> 55:01.791
Hello, madam.

55:05.291 --> 55:06.291
I'm Kropp.

55:10.791 --> 55:11.708
And you?

55:24.083 --> 55:25.083
Do you want to…

55:29.166 --> 55:30.750
Do you want to come with me?

55:33.041 --> 55:33.916
Not a problem.

56:28.333 --> 56:29.166
Kat.

56:32.083 --> 56:32.916
Kat!

56:34.750 --> 56:35.583
Kat!

56:45.583 --> 56:46.583
Shit.

56:52.666 --> 56:54.666
-Bloody kids.
-Yeah.

56:55.625 --> 56:57.916
They took their masks off too soon.

57:01.708 --> 57:03.375
Soon, Germany will be empty.

57:20.666 --> 57:24.791
COMPIÈGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER 1918

58:26.375 --> 58:27.250
Sir.

58:29.708 --> 58:31.500
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

58:31.583 --> 58:33.416
The French are putting the pressure on.

58:33.500 --> 58:36.208
Early this morning,
our scouts intercepted orders

58:36.291 --> 58:38.333
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

58:38.416 --> 58:41.083
A fleet of tanks
is still stuck in Fernancourt.

58:41.166 --> 58:43.000
We need to prepare for an attack.

58:44.416 --> 58:47.208
The Social Democrats will be
the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

58:49.833 --> 58:50.875
Sir?

58:55.375 --> 58:58.500
I just put the German delegation
on the train to Compiègne

58:58.583 --> 59:00.083
to negotiate a ceasefire.

59:07.041 --> 59:10.375
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling off our fatherland.

59:11.916 --> 59:13.666
My order is war.

59:14.750 --> 59:18.333
And as long as that's the case,
I'll fight tooth and nail.

59:20.541 --> 59:23.000
We have to hold firm
and wait for fresh troops.

59:23.083 --> 59:25.916
New recruits are due in a few months.

59:27.125 --> 59:31.500
The French are trying
to force their shitty terms on us.

59:34.208 --> 59:35.958
I will not surrender.

59:38.833 --> 59:41.791
We have to strike now with all our might.

59:47.041 --> 59:47.916
Sir.

1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:11.666
For our part,

1:00:13.125 --> 1:00:14.583
I have to insist…

1:00:15.791 --> 1:00:17.291
we have to insist…

1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:19.875
For God's sake!

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.333
Shit.

1:00:54.458 --> 1:00:55.291
Sir!

1:01:05.458 --> 1:01:07.125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

1:01:07.208 --> 1:01:09.833
roll up your bedding
and wash your mess kits.

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:13.541
The entire regiment
is being sent to the front line.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:15.875
We're taking anyone
who can stand on two legs.

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:19.833
Line up, damn it!

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:23.666
You think the French will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:24.875
Here we go again.

1:01:24.958 --> 1:01:26.666
-Move it!
-Where to?

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.041
Where to?

1:01:28.541 --> 1:01:29.541
Into battle.

1:03:04.666 --> 1:03:06.708
Monsieur le Maréchal is expecting you.

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:15.583
I'll be back soon.

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:32.083
Jealous?

1:04:49.875 --> 1:04:51.541
I stand before you

1:04:52.125 --> 1:04:55.625
in the hope that you will take
our presence as an opportunity

1:04:56.125 --> 1:04:58.375
to suspend all hostilities.

1:05:00.208 --> 1:05:01.833
In the name of humanity,

1:05:02.625 --> 1:05:05.375
I ask you to agree
to an immediate ceasefire

1:05:05.458 --> 1:05:07.958
for the duration of our negotiations

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:11.958
in order to spare our nations
any unnecessary losses.

1:05:14.166 --> 1:05:17.416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

1:05:31.750 --> 1:05:34.666
Marshal Foch asks
what brings us gentlemen to him.

1:05:38.625 --> 1:05:40.583
We look forward to your suggestions

1:05:41.458 --> 1:05:47.458
for bringing about a permanent ceasefire
at sea, on land and in the air.

1:05:51.416 --> 1:05:53.666
I don't have any suggestions for you.

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:57.791
What does he mean?

1:05:58.625 --> 1:06:01.541
I think he might not like
how you phrased it.

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:04.208
Yes.

1:06:04.791 --> 1:06:06.083
Okay, then…

1:06:09.541 --> 1:06:10.625
Monsieur le Maréchal,

1:06:10.708 --> 1:06:14.583
if you please,
we would like to know the conditions…

1:06:23.416 --> 1:06:25.625
He wants you to formally ask for it.

1:06:33.125 --> 1:06:34.375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:38.791
I'm asking you for an armistice.

1:06:40.416 --> 1:06:42.958
We're asking for an armistice.

1:06:51.208 --> 1:06:54.833
You have 72 hours to accept
our conditions. They are non-negotiable.

1:06:54.916 --> 1:06:58.000
-72 hours?
-The war will continue until you sign.

1:06:58.083 --> 1:06:59.333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

1:06:59.833 --> 1:07:03.125
in the name of God,
don't let 72 hours go by.

1:07:04.625 --> 1:07:06.500
People are dying out there.

1:07:12.958 --> 1:07:13.958
Sign then.

1:07:29.750 --> 1:07:30.750
Understood.

1:07:50.291 --> 1:07:51.458
Soldiers, march.

1:07:54.750 --> 1:07:55.750
Soldiers, march.

1:07:57.333 --> 1:07:58.333
March, soldiers.

1:08:01.208 --> 1:08:02.208
Soldiers, march.

1:08:03.375 --> 1:08:04.708
Let's go. Out of here!

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:07.041
March, soldiers.

1:08:08.833 --> 1:08:09.666
March.

1:08:10.833 --> 1:08:11.791
Soldiers, march.

1:08:13.333 --> 1:08:14.958
March, soldiers. Out of here!

1:08:27.708 --> 1:08:29.750
Charge!

1:08:29.833 --> 1:08:31.875
-Faster!
-Hooray!

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:34.375
-Faster!
-Hooray!

1:08:35.125 --> 1:08:36.500
Onwards, men!

1:08:38.083 --> 1:08:39.083
Charge!

1:08:43.291 --> 1:08:45.625
Hooray!

1:08:46.541 --> 1:08:48.375
Keep ranks!

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:49.916
Keep going!

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:07.000
Go, go, go!

1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:38.000
Let's go, Paul. Come on. Paul!

1:12:10.375 --> 1:12:11.250
Get out!

1:12:53.916 --> 1:12:55.291
Open fire!

1:12:56.083 --> 1:12:57.333
Open fire!

1:13:39.541 --> 1:13:41.166
Get down!

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:42.375
Get down!

1:13:43.208 --> 1:13:44.458
Take cover!

1:14:02.708 --> 1:14:04.708
Get out of here! Get out!

1:14:07.291 --> 1:14:09.833
Stay where you are and close ranks!

1:14:32.458 --> 1:14:33.708
Hand grenades!

1:14:33.791 --> 1:14:36.708
Aim for the tracks when they're above us.

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:03.500
Let's go, men! Go! Franz!

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:04.416
Franz!

1:15:04.916 --> 1:15:06.375
Follow me!

1:15:15.666 --> 1:15:16.500
Franz!

1:15:16.583 --> 1:15:18.083
Come on! Follow me!

1:15:20.208 --> 1:15:21.083
Franz!

1:15:21.166 --> 1:15:22.291
Go! Come on!

1:15:22.375 --> 1:15:23.291
Paul!

1:15:39.083 --> 1:15:39.916
Charge!

1:16:07.416 --> 1:16:08.583
Paul.

1:16:08.666 --> 1:16:09.708
Paul!

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:26.958
Open fire!

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:42.000
Retreat!

1:16:42.833 --> 1:16:43.916
Retreat!

1:17:59.333 --> 1:18:02.125
No, don't shoot! No!

1:18:02.208 --> 1:18:03.583
No!

1:18:03.666 --> 1:18:05.125
No!

1:18:05.791 --> 1:18:08.250
Don't! Don't shoot!

1:18:08.333 --> 1:18:09.250
Albert.

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.708
-Albert.
-Come on!

1:18:19.791 --> 1:18:20.916
Come on!

1:18:26.958 --> 1:18:27.875
Keep going!

1:18:54.166 --> 1:18:55.333
Where's Franz?

1:18:55.416 --> 1:18:56.666
I've lost Franz!

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:07.166
Katczinsky!
Secure the machine gun and retreat!

1:19:07.250 --> 1:19:10.583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast of here.

1:19:12.791 --> 1:19:15.500
I am missing my comrades, Sergeant!

1:19:15.583 --> 1:19:17.833
And I miss my mother, damn it!

1:19:17.916 --> 1:19:20.250
Grenades! Ammunition! Let's go!

1:19:22.541 --> 1:19:23.541
Paul, come on!

1:19:51.791 --> 1:19:54.375
This isn't a negotiation.
This is a diktat.

1:19:54.458 --> 1:19:57.708
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

1:19:57.791 --> 1:19:59.166
And what good will that do?

1:19:59.791 --> 1:20:01.666
Even if we end up losing,

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:04.625
we won't be any worse off
than with this surrender.

1:20:04.708 --> 1:20:06.666
Besides a few hundred thousand
more deaths.

1:20:06.750 --> 1:20:10.875
Alsace-Lorraine, occupation of the Rhine,
artillery, locomotives, trains.

1:20:10.958 --> 1:20:13.250
This is total capitulation!

1:20:13.333 --> 1:20:17.458
250,000 Americans are landing
in Europe every month.

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:20.958
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai, all lost.

1:20:22.166 --> 1:20:25.208
The only thing separating us
from a ceasefire is false pride.

1:20:25.833 --> 1:20:29.291
It's time to deal with the mess
you and your generals have left us.

1:20:29.375 --> 1:20:31.583
But if you'd rather leave now, go ahead.

1:20:32.083 --> 1:20:33.208
We're staying here.

1:20:39.708 --> 1:20:40.708
It's winter.

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:45.125
Without trains and provisions,
the Bolsheviks will overrun us.

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.875
The men will starve on the way home,

1:20:47.958 --> 1:20:50.375
instead of dying with honour
on the battlefield.

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:52.416
Honour?

1:20:54.458 --> 1:20:57.125
My son was killed in this war.
Where's his honour?

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:04.625
Von Helldorf.

1:21:05.708 --> 1:21:09.875
Get a few copies of the Allied demands
and telegraph them to headquarters.

1:21:10.458 --> 1:21:11.916
Inform the government.

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:17.625
We have 72 hours, gentlemen,

1:21:17.708 --> 1:21:21.041
and every minute we waste talking here,
another soldier dies.

1:21:22.208 --> 1:21:25.750
Let's find mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

1:21:26.541 --> 1:21:28.291
let's end this war.

1:22:12.916 --> 1:22:15.250
Retreat!

1:22:19.750 --> 1:22:22.750
They're retreating! Barrage!

1:22:22.833 --> 1:22:24.666
Barrage!

1:23:24.083 --> 1:23:25.083
Be quiet!

1:24:09.541 --> 1:24:10.541
Shut up.

1:24:13.750 --> 1:24:14.750
Shut up!

1:26:10.333 --> 1:26:11.708
No!

1:26:12.208 --> 1:26:13.125
Comrade.

1:26:14.250 --> 1:26:16.041
Comrade.

1:26:20.250 --> 1:26:21.250
Comrade.

1:27:18.625 --> 1:27:19.541
I'm sorry.

1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.000
I'm sorry.

1:27:23.083 --> 1:27:25.208
I'm so sorry.

1:28:20.333 --> 1:28:21.166
House…

1:28:23.250 --> 1:28:24.166
Your wife…

1:28:25.625 --> 1:28:27.125
I promise.

1:28:29.083 --> 1:28:30.041
I pro…

1:30:17.416 --> 1:30:19.166
When were you born, Brixdorf?

1:30:21.333 --> 1:30:22.916
1877, in June.

1:30:25.208 --> 1:30:26.583
A summer child.

1:30:27.791 --> 1:30:28.791
Yes.

1:30:31.875 --> 1:30:33.166
What does your father do?

1:30:35.500 --> 1:30:37.625
My family owns a manufactory in Holstein.

1:30:39.666 --> 1:30:40.541
What kind?

1:30:42.541 --> 1:30:44.125
Riding saddles, sir.

1:30:44.208 --> 1:30:45.291
Riding saddles.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:48.250
They'll always sell.

1:30:49.333 --> 1:30:50.458
Your future is safe.

1:30:52.125 --> 1:30:53.208
I'm very lucky.

1:30:55.833 --> 1:30:56.666
Well?

1:30:57.666 --> 1:30:59.208
Looking forward to going home?

1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:03.416
-When we're not needed here any more?
-Yes.

1:31:04.833 --> 1:31:07.041
There's a job waiting for me
after the war.

1:31:08.833 --> 1:31:10.250
I'll take over the business.

1:31:11.958 --> 1:31:12.958
Congratulations.

1:31:13.583 --> 1:31:14.916
What about you?

1:31:16.958 --> 1:31:18.166
I'm a soldier.

1:31:19.833 --> 1:31:22.041
My father was an officer in this regiment.

1:31:23.375 --> 1:31:25.750
He fought in three wars under Bismarck.

1:31:26.250 --> 1:31:27.666
He won all three.

1:31:28.291 --> 1:31:30.583
In 1871, he marched on Paris.

1:31:31.333 --> 1:31:33.041
He came home a hero.

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:39.291
I was born too late, Brixdorf.

1:31:40.791 --> 1:31:42.625
Half a century without war.

1:31:44.125 --> 1:31:46.291
What is a soldier without war?

1:31:52.875 --> 1:31:54.916
Were you close to your father?

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.416
As a child, perhaps.

1:31:59.541 --> 1:32:01.791
A man is born alone,

1:32:02.458 --> 1:32:03.458
he lives alone,

1:32:04.666 --> 1:32:05.958
and he dies alone.

1:32:36.166 --> 1:32:37.916
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:39.000
Come in.

1:32:40.416 --> 1:32:42.041
Von Helldorf, what is it?

1:32:42.625 --> 1:32:43.500
Hindenburg.

1:32:43.583 --> 1:32:44.791
Open it then.

1:32:51.416 --> 1:32:52.625
He urges us to sign.

1:32:55.916 --> 1:32:57.041
It's over!

1:33:08.916 --> 1:33:11.708
"…the sin of the world, have mercy on us."

1:33:11.791 --> 1:33:15.625
"Lamb of God,
you take away the sin of the world…"

1:33:21.583 --> 1:33:23.666
Knock on the monastery door,

1:33:23.750 --> 1:33:26.416
and you'll find only
thieves and scoundrels.

1:33:26.500 --> 1:33:29.791
It's over. The fat pigs have realised.

1:33:29.875 --> 1:33:33.666
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, soldier!

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:39.833
Where's the infirmary?

1:33:48.708 --> 1:33:50.666
-No!
-Just chloroform the man!

1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:06.333
Bäumer.

1:34:07.791 --> 1:34:08.625
Bäumer.

1:34:12.583 --> 1:34:13.500
Bäumer.

1:34:14.916 --> 1:34:17.041
-Tjaden.
-Bäumer.

1:34:18.875 --> 1:34:21.083
What happened? Where did you get hit?

1:34:21.583 --> 1:34:22.625
Above the knee.

1:34:23.750 --> 1:34:24.666
I think.

1:34:25.416 --> 1:34:26.791
I can't feel anything.

1:34:27.708 --> 1:34:29.500
How far above the knee was I shot?

1:34:30.458 --> 1:34:32.125
I can't lift my head.

1:34:33.666 --> 1:34:35.291
Ten centimetres at least.

1:34:39.875 --> 1:34:41.958
-You're going home, Tjaden.
-You think so?

1:34:42.041 --> 1:34:43.041
Yes, of course.

1:34:47.833 --> 1:34:50.125
How can I be a ranger like this?

1:34:52.166 --> 1:34:53.333
For Christ's sake!

1:34:54.541 --> 1:34:55.750
You still can.

1:34:58.125 --> 1:34:59.250
You'll see.

1:34:59.958 --> 1:35:01.791
I won't let them amputate.

1:35:03.375 --> 1:35:05.208
I won't live as a cripple.

1:35:05.916 --> 1:35:07.041
You won't have to.

1:35:07.125 --> 1:35:09.166
They've patched up much worse here.

1:35:13.958 --> 1:35:15.291
Oh, Paul.

1:35:16.041 --> 1:35:17.666
I'm supposed to give you something.

1:35:49.333 --> 1:35:50.333
Is he dead?

1:35:56.041 --> 1:35:57.666
You have to be brave now.

1:35:59.458 --> 1:36:00.625
You're alive.

1:36:00.708 --> 1:36:02.500
You have to be grateful for that.

1:36:02.583 --> 1:36:03.541
For us.

1:36:04.041 --> 1:36:05.791
For those who didn't make it.

1:36:05.875 --> 1:36:06.750
Be quiet.

1:36:06.833 --> 1:36:09.333
Listen, you can't say that. Not you.

1:37:01.958 --> 1:37:03.500
That would really suit you.

1:37:03.583 --> 1:37:04.791
Not until everyone's here…

1:37:04.875 --> 1:37:07.083
They're in the infirmary or mass graves.

1:37:07.166 --> 1:37:09.958
-Dish it up. We can smell it's done.
-I can't.

1:37:10.041 --> 1:37:11.500
Why not, you vagrant?

1:37:11.583 --> 1:37:15.416
I've cooked for 150.
I can't serve 80 men food for 150!

1:37:15.500 --> 1:37:17.916
Are you thick as pig shit?

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:21.083
You've received provisions
for the second company.

1:37:21.166 --> 1:37:23.791
-We're the second company!
-Yes!

1:37:23.875 --> 1:37:25.958
So dish it out, full stop!

1:37:26.541 --> 1:37:27.375
Kat!

1:37:27.958 --> 1:37:29.000
-Kat!
-Paul!

1:37:29.083 --> 1:37:29.916
Kat!

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:31.541
Paul!

1:37:32.166 --> 1:37:33.833
-Paul!
-Kat, you're alive!

1:37:34.708 --> 1:37:35.666
You're alive!

1:37:35.750 --> 1:37:37.041
Paul!

1:37:44.958 --> 1:37:46.000
Tjaden got hit.

1:37:46.500 --> 1:37:47.583
He's in the church.

1:37:49.083 --> 1:37:50.791
He'll get a double helping from us.

1:37:50.875 --> 1:37:51.875
-Yes.
-Come on.

1:37:52.708 --> 1:37:53.541
Careful.

1:37:56.250 --> 1:37:57.250
And one here too.

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:02.708
Bloody hell, I thought you were dead.

1:38:04.541 --> 1:38:06.208
We'll all die at some point.

1:38:07.041 --> 1:38:08.666
But not on the home stretch.

1:38:11.125 --> 1:38:13.208
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

1:38:18.916 --> 1:38:19.916
Tjaden.

1:38:21.791 --> 1:38:22.791
Tjaden.

1:38:28.875 --> 1:38:29.875
Kat?

1:38:34.083 --> 1:38:35.083
Kat.

1:38:36.083 --> 1:38:37.500
We brought you some soup.

1:38:37.583 --> 1:38:39.291
Did you bring some cutlery?

1:38:39.875 --> 1:38:41.541
Yes, we brought some cutlery too.

1:38:46.500 --> 1:38:47.916
Enjoy it.

1:39:11.583 --> 1:39:14.333
No! Tjaden, stop! Stop it, Tjaden!

1:39:14.833 --> 1:39:16.166
Tjaden, no!

1:39:20.416 --> 1:39:21.666
We need help here!

1:39:22.375 --> 1:39:23.583
Why did you do that?

1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:25.333
Why?

1:39:25.916 --> 1:39:27.958
It's over, boys, it's over.

1:39:28.041 --> 1:39:29.416
He's bleeding out!

1:39:30.833 --> 1:39:31.666
Quiet.

1:39:34.375 --> 1:39:35.208
Tjaden.

1:39:40.916 --> 1:39:41.750
Tjaden.

1:41:15.958 --> 1:41:16.791
What is it?

1:41:19.125 --> 1:41:20.125
I've lost something.

1:41:24.958 --> 1:41:26.291
Kat, can you speak French?

1:41:33.708 --> 1:41:35.541
My mother wanted me to learn French.

1:41:40.041 --> 1:41:41.041
And piano.

1:41:43.541 --> 1:41:45.500
She didn't want me to go to war.

1:41:46.541 --> 1:41:49.833
"It's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

1:41:52.083 --> 1:41:53.916
I wanted to show them I could do it.

1:41:54.875 --> 1:41:56.208
How does that help us now?

1:41:59.708 --> 1:42:01.583
"In a few weeks, we'll be in Paris."

1:42:04.208 --> 1:42:07.375
I can't discard two years
of hand grenades like a pair of socks.

1:42:07.458 --> 1:42:10.125
-Paul…
-We'll never get rid of the stench.

1:42:10.208 --> 1:42:12.125
-Enough.
-Ludwig's dead, Franz, Albert…

1:42:12.208 --> 1:42:13.541
What's it to us now?

1:42:15.250 --> 1:42:17.708
At least they're at peace. We're alive.

1:42:25.875 --> 1:42:27.541
All of this is like a fever.

1:42:28.291 --> 1:42:30.708
No one actually wants it,
but suddenly it's here.

1:42:31.625 --> 1:42:33.833
We didn't want it,
the others didn't want it.

1:42:33.916 --> 1:42:36.833
And yet, here we are.
And yet, half the world is here.

1:42:36.916 --> 1:42:38.083
And God watches on

1:42:39.791 --> 1:42:41.166
as we slaughter each other.

1:42:45.625 --> 1:42:46.625
Well…

1:42:50.333 --> 1:42:51.333
But what do I know?

1:42:51.958 --> 1:42:52.958
I know nothing.

1:42:53.750 --> 1:42:55.416
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

1:42:57.625 --> 1:42:59.083
Get some sleep. We got lucky.

1:42:59.875 --> 1:43:00.708
Yes.

1:43:18.833 --> 1:43:19.666
Kat?

1:43:23.833 --> 1:43:25.333
What did your son die of?

1:43:30.750 --> 1:43:31.958
Smallpox.

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:41.541
I'm afraid of what's to come.

1:43:49.166 --> 1:43:50.166
Don't be.

1:44:22.208 --> 1:44:23.041
Henri.

1:44:26.708 --> 1:44:27.625
Taste it.

1:44:31.833 --> 1:44:32.833
Are they fresh?

1:44:35.916 --> 1:44:37.875
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think so.

1:45:02.208 --> 1:45:03.541
Monsieur le Maréchal.

1:45:10.875 --> 1:45:12.208
I'm listening.

1:45:12.291 --> 1:45:14.041
The Kaiser has abdicated.

1:45:14.125 --> 1:45:18.666
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

1:45:18.750 --> 1:45:23.833
The new government will do its utmost
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

1:45:23.916 --> 1:45:28.291
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

1:45:28.375 --> 1:45:30.750
risks descending into famine and anarchy.

1:45:30.833 --> 1:45:34.041
This is a disease of the defeated,
not of the victorious.

1:45:34.125 --> 1:45:37.208
I don't fear it. I reject any compromise.

1:45:38.958 --> 1:45:40.750
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

1:45:42.208 --> 1:45:45.500
Be fair to your enemy,
otherwise he will hate this peace.

1:45:45.583 --> 1:45:46.583
Fair?

1:45:49.875 --> 1:45:51.875
You speak of fairness?

1:46:05.625 --> 1:46:06.750
Sign it.

1:47:11.458 --> 1:47:13.708
Let the minutes record

1:47:13.791 --> 1:47:17.958
that the armistice
will take effect in six hours

1:47:18.041 --> 1:47:21.791
at the 11th hour
on the 11th day of the 11th month.

1:47:24.250 --> 1:47:25.083
Very good.

1:47:26.250 --> 1:47:27.416
The war is over.

1:47:41.708 --> 1:47:42.916
What will you do now?

1:47:45.416 --> 1:47:47.000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

1:47:49.250 --> 1:47:51.041
The plains of Latierre, sir.

1:47:51.125 --> 1:47:52.000
Eguisac.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.166
I see them too.

1:47:55.458 --> 1:47:58.041
And German soldiers
running away like rabbits.

1:48:00.041 --> 1:48:02.333
The French are farting
into our posts in Latierre,

1:48:02.416 --> 1:48:04.958
and out there is a train
full of horse fuckers,

1:48:05.041 --> 1:48:06.500
selling off our homeland.

1:48:10.541 --> 1:48:15.041
Withdraw the recruits from all posts.
Have them assemble in the courtyard.

1:48:15.750 --> 1:48:18.041
We're going to sort out this shitty mess!

1:48:29.583 --> 1:48:32.666
<i>Any communication with the enemy</i>
<i>remains prohibited.</i>

1:48:33.541 --> 1:48:38.416
<i>Firstly, hostilities</i>
<i>on the entire front will cease today,</i>

1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:41.333
<i>11th November,</i>
<i>at 11 o'clock in the morning.</i>

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.958
<i>Secondly, troops will not cross the lines</i>
<i>held on this day, at this hour.</i>

1:48:49.625 --> 1:48:51.500
<i>The lines will be accurately marked…</i>

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:55.500
What time is it?

1:49:01.500 --> 1:49:03.375
-Why aren't you sleeping?
-Listen.

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.125
It's so quiet here.

1:49:10.708 --> 1:49:12.000
I think I've gone deaf.

1:49:18.416 --> 1:49:19.708
They've signed, Paul.

1:49:24.541 --> 1:49:26.000
The war's over.

1:49:27.541 --> 1:49:28.750
It's over.

1:49:34.250 --> 1:49:35.250
Are you hungry?

1:49:36.458 --> 1:49:37.458
I'm hungry.

1:49:42.458 --> 1:49:43.791
Where are you going?

1:49:43.875 --> 1:49:45.791
Come on, before the bastard wakes up.

1:49:48.125 --> 1:49:50.875
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
-I don't know.

1:49:51.833 --> 1:49:52.916
I'm roasting a goose.

1:49:53.625 --> 1:49:55.125
With red cabbage, potatoes.

1:49:55.208 --> 1:49:57.916
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.208
My God, Paul. My wife, she's beautiful.

1:50:01.125 --> 1:50:02.041
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:50:02.125 --> 1:50:04.291
-What does she look like?
-Well…

1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.083
Long, dark, curly hair.

1:50:07.833 --> 1:50:09.833
And she's round and strong.

1:50:10.375 --> 1:50:11.375
Yeah?

1:50:13.583 --> 1:50:14.708
Christmas.

1:50:15.375 --> 1:50:16.666
It's all so far away.

1:50:17.250 --> 1:50:19.250
But it isn't. It's very soon.

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.208
We want another child. Children, Paul.

1:50:26.166 --> 1:50:28.916
Because what's Christmas without children?
It's nothing.

1:50:32.208 --> 1:50:33.208
You know, once…

1:50:33.916 --> 1:50:35.583
Once we're back home, then…

1:50:36.291 --> 1:50:37.958
-Yeah?
-We'll do something big.

1:50:38.833 --> 1:50:40.375
The two of us together, okay?

1:50:40.875 --> 1:50:41.708
Well…

1:50:43.791 --> 1:50:44.625
What?

1:50:45.458 --> 1:50:48.291
I'm a cobbler, Paul. I repair shoes.

1:50:48.375 --> 1:50:51.958
Yeah? You can read, write.
You have your school diplomas.

1:50:53.125 --> 1:50:54.458
Didn't do me any good.

1:50:55.541 --> 1:50:56.750
What are we going to do?

1:50:57.333 --> 1:50:58.916
Nail soles on shoes together?

1:50:59.833 --> 1:51:01.291
Are you trying to insult me?

1:51:02.208 --> 1:51:04.166
I can't even read a letter from my wife.

1:51:05.250 --> 1:51:06.625
Go to college, Paul.

1:51:07.583 --> 1:51:09.083
Or I'll shoot you right here.

1:51:11.375 --> 1:51:12.916
My trousers are falling down.

1:51:15.333 --> 1:51:16.458
My trousers are loose.

1:51:19.125 --> 1:51:20.791
You'll just have to eat a little.

1:51:22.125 --> 1:51:24.500
Soon we'll be home,
then we can eat what we want.

1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:26.583
Whatever we want.

1:51:51.416 --> 1:51:52.416
It's your turn.

1:51:53.250 --> 1:51:55.125
If the farmer catches me again,

1:51:55.208 --> 1:51:56.541
he'll shoot me.

1:52:01.583 --> 1:52:03.250
Watch out for the damn dog.

1:52:03.333 --> 1:52:04.166
Yeah.

1:53:18.208 --> 1:53:19.041
Look.

1:53:22.208 --> 1:53:23.541
It's really good.

1:53:26.916 --> 1:53:27.750
Want some?

1:53:30.333 --> 1:53:31.208
Shit.

1:54:22.291 --> 1:54:23.125
Hey!

1:54:24.166 --> 1:54:25.208
Stop!

1:54:34.291 --> 1:54:36.791
Kat! Run!

1:54:39.250 --> 1:54:40.250
Bastard!

1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:46.875
Damn.

1:55:07.041 --> 1:55:08.250
Oh, crap.

1:55:08.750 --> 1:55:09.958
Look at this.

1:55:10.041 --> 1:55:11.041
What is it?

1:55:11.125 --> 1:55:13.083
-I got lucky.
-He hit the eggs?

1:55:14.958 --> 1:55:16.375
-Press on it.
-Okay.

1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.458
Come on, get it all in there.

1:55:24.041 --> 1:55:24.916
All of it.

1:55:27.916 --> 1:55:29.000
We can fry them.

1:55:29.666 --> 1:55:32.416
Nonsense. We'll eat them right now.
Like this is fine too.

1:55:51.375 --> 1:55:52.958
Doesn't get better than that.

1:55:54.208 --> 1:55:55.125
I'll be right back.

1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:33.333
Kat?

1:57:38.416 --> 1:57:39.500
Kat?

1:57:43.958 --> 1:57:44.791
Kat!

1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:48.000
What happened?

1:57:48.916 --> 1:57:49.750
Let's go.

1:57:51.708 --> 1:57:54.541
-Who fired the shot?
-The little shit from the farm.

1:57:55.625 --> 1:57:56.833
The farmer's boy.

1:57:58.875 --> 1:57:59.791
Kat!

1:58:01.250 --> 1:58:02.208
What a mess.

1:58:10.291 --> 1:58:11.166
How big?

1:58:11.833 --> 1:58:14.000
Little finger. I'll get the bullet out.

1:58:14.083 --> 1:58:16.041
No, just give me a cigarette.

1:58:16.708 --> 1:58:18.458
Leave that to the medic.

1:58:37.333 --> 1:58:39.625
They stuck me
in a class of seven-year-olds.

1:58:41.083 --> 1:58:42.583
I had already started shaving.

1:58:44.458 --> 1:58:45.666
Find a word…

1:58:47.666 --> 1:58:49.208
that rhymes with trifle.

1:58:53.416 --> 1:58:55.583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1:59:01.916 --> 1:59:03.583
For Christ's sake!

1:59:04.791 --> 1:59:07.083
Did it have to happen now, of all times?

1:59:10.916 --> 1:59:12.416
-We have to keep going.
-Yeah.

1:59:13.375 --> 1:59:14.375
Keep going.

1:59:19.750 --> 1:59:21.458
Okay? Kat?

1:59:23.333 --> 1:59:24.541
Rifle.

1:59:25.541 --> 1:59:27.166
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1:59:37.583 --> 1:59:41.166
When we get home, you're going
to make me a new pair of boots.

1:59:41.250 --> 1:59:42.791
I'm walking my feet bloody.

1:59:57.291 --> 1:59:58.166
Stop!

2:00:01.625 --> 2:00:02.458
Stop!

2:00:04.333 --> 2:00:05.208
Stop!

2:00:05.875 --> 2:00:06.750
Stop!

2:00:08.416 --> 2:00:09.250
Stop!

2:00:57.291 --> 2:00:58.291
Medic!

2:01:00.916 --> 2:01:02.041
Medic!

2:01:30.833 --> 2:01:32.666
You could've saved yourself the trouble.

2:01:35.750 --> 2:01:37.166
He's dead.

2:01:42.166 --> 2:01:44.500
It's… It's just a small bullet wound.

2:01:45.166 --> 2:01:47.916
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

2:01:48.500 --> 2:01:49.958
His organs are poisoned.

2:01:56.375 --> 2:01:57.416
Unconscious.

2:01:59.750 --> 2:02:00.791
He's dead.

2:02:01.458 --> 2:02:03.041
I know more about these things.

2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000
That… That's impossible. I was…

2:02:06.541 --> 2:02:08.291
I was just talking to him.

2:02:08.375 --> 2:02:09.375
He's unconscious.

2:02:11.375 --> 2:02:12.375
He's unconscious.

2:02:19.791 --> 2:02:21.000
You see?

2:02:22.625 --> 2:02:23.750
He was just unlucky.

2:02:24.375 --> 2:02:25.375
So close to the end.

2:03:01.166 --> 2:03:04.791
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

2:03:04.875 --> 2:03:08.291
<i>Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee</i>

2:03:08.375 --> 2:03:12.083
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

2:03:12.166 --> 2:03:14.791
<i>And a glass of wine</i>

2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.750
<i>Girl, I do love you…</i>

2:03:49.541 --> 2:03:51.250
Come along, soldier!

2:03:51.333 --> 2:03:54.416
The General's sending us home!
We're going home!

2:03:55.083 --> 2:03:56.791
We're going home!

2:04:14.708 --> 2:04:17.083
Go on, keep going!

2:04:17.875 --> 2:04:19.000
Step it up a notch!

2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.208
Attention!

2:04:45.416 --> 2:04:46.375
Soldiers,

2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:49.125
we stand here as brothers

2:04:50.333 --> 2:04:53.916
in a world of enemies, forced to watch

2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:58.708
as German social democrats render
our beloved people defenceless

2:04:59.208 --> 2:05:02.833
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

2:05:04.208 --> 2:05:05.041
Comrades,

2:05:06.333 --> 2:05:08.125
you will be going home soon

2:05:08.208 --> 2:05:10.291
to parents, wives and children.

2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:12.583
The war is over.

2:05:13.375 --> 2:05:18.083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

2:05:18.750 --> 2:05:23.125
The reward of admiration
for everything you've achieved here.

2:05:24.416 --> 2:05:25.958
But, comrades,

2:05:27.458 --> 2:05:30.250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes,

2:05:32.291 --> 2:05:33.166
or as cowards

2:05:33.250 --> 2:05:36.416
who chickened out
when it really came down to it?

2:05:37.625 --> 2:05:38.500
Soldiers,

2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:43.333
we're going to strike now
with all our rigour and might.

2:05:43.958 --> 2:05:46.708
Latierre belongs in German hands.

2:05:47.666 --> 2:05:50.333
We will seize the plains before 11 a.m.

2:05:50.416 --> 2:05:53.958
and end this war with a victory!

2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:00.041
Onwards with God who will be with us,
as He was with our fathers.

2:06:01.666 --> 2:06:04.333
I'm not going back into battle. Not me!

2:06:04.416 --> 2:06:05.416
Shut up!

2:06:14.625 --> 2:06:15.458
Take aim!

2:06:16.708 --> 2:06:18.166
-No!
-Fire!

2:06:55.708 --> 2:06:57.666
Company, halt!

2:07:02.458 --> 2:07:04.125
Order arms!

2:07:04.666 --> 2:07:06.458
Fix bayonets!

2:07:22.416 --> 2:07:23.416
What time?

2:07:24.125 --> 2:07:25.333
Fifteen minutes to go.

2:08:02.625 --> 2:08:03.708
Belonged to Lefèvre.

2:08:05.291 --> 2:08:07.708
Poor bastard. He saved it for the end.

2:08:07.791 --> 2:08:10.083
-He won't need it any more.
-Thank you, sir.

2:08:14.375 --> 2:08:16.041
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

2:08:22.541 --> 2:08:23.541
Well, it's good.

2:08:27.166 --> 2:08:28.291
The nightmare is over.

2:09:28.375 --> 2:09:31.333
Enemy attack!

2:09:31.416 --> 2:09:33.083
-In position!
-In position!

2:09:36.166 --> 2:09:37.083
Fire!

2:09:37.958 --> 2:09:39.166
Fire!

2:09:46.833 --> 2:09:48.166
Fire!

2:10:14.375 --> 2:10:15.750
Grenades!

2:10:26.791 --> 2:10:27.958
Charge!

2:11:24.208 --> 2:11:25.500
No, no! Please!

2:11:30.958 --> 2:11:32.125
No! Don't! No!

2:13:16.625 --> 2:13:18.333
Cease fire!

2:13:18.416 --> 2:13:19.958
It's eleven o'clock!

2:13:21.041 --> 2:13:24.791
Cease fire!

2:13:25.291 --> 2:13:26.875
It's eleven o'clock!

2:16:25.125 --> 2:16:26.500
Are you all right, soldier?

2:16:27.875 --> 2:16:28.916
Yes.

2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:29.916
Well, then…

2:16:30.791 --> 2:16:32.041
Start collecting, please.

2:19:53.541 --> 2:19:56.625
SHORTLY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
IN OCTOBER 1914,

2:19:56.708 --> 2:19:59.958
THE WESTERN FRONT BECAME BOGGED DOWN
IN TRENCH WARFARE.

2:20:01.625 --> 2:20:07.750
AT THE END OF THE WAR IN NOVEMBER 1918,
THE FRONT LINE HAD BARELY MOVED.

2:20:09.416 --> 2:20:12.125
MORE THAN THREE MILLION SOLDIERS
DIED HERE,

2:20:12.208 --> 2:20:15.791
OFTEN WHILE FIGHTING TO GAIN
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED METRES OF GROUND.

2:20:17.541 --> 2:20:23.708
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR,
ALMOST 17 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

2:20:25.750 --> 2:20:32.583
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

2:26:56.375 --> 2:27:01.375
