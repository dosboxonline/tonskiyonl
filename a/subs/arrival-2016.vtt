01:32.700 --> 01:36.227
<i>I used to think
this was the beginning of your story.</i>

01:43.500 --> 01:45.548
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

01:47.300 --> 01:49.541
<i>It doesn't work like I thought it did.</i>

01:50.500 --> 01:52.741
<i>We are so bound by time,</i>

01:53.900 --> 01:55.789
<i>by its order.</i>

02:16.180 --> 02:17.420
Okay.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.264
Okay, come back to me.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.991
Come back to me.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.945
Come back to me.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.431
Stick 'em up!

02:34.260 --> 02:37.184
Are you the sheriff in this here town?

02:37.940 --> 02:40.591
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna get ya.

02:41.140 --> 02:42.346
No.

02:42.420 --> 02:45.822
You want me to chase you?
You better run.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.787
<i>I remember moments in the middle.</i>

03:11.140 --> 03:12.630
I love you.

03:13.580 --> 03:14.866
I hate you!

03:27.300 --> 03:28.870
<i>And this was the end.</i>

03:37.580 --> 03:39.344
Come back to me.

03:39.940 --> 03:41.624
Come back to me.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.703
<i>But now I'm not so sure
I believe in beginnings and endings.</i>

04:02.140 --> 04:05.861
<i>There are days
that define your story beyond your life.</i>

04:07.500 --> 04:09.502
<i>Like the day they arrived.</i>

04:21.180 --> 04:22.181
Good morning.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.546
Morning.
Morning.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.630
Where is everyone?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.742
Okay. Well, let's get started.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.545
Today, we are talking about Portuguese

04:35.820 --> 04:39.711
and why it sounds so different
from the other Romance languages.

04:40.420 --> 04:44.391
The story of Portuguese
begins in the kingdom of Galicia...

04:46.140 --> 04:48.302
Sorry.
In the Middle Ages,

04:49.380 --> 04:53.351
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.070
Any news you wanna share?

05:02.900 --> 05:05.983
Dr. Banks, can you
turn the TV to a news channel?

05:22.380 --> 05:23.427
<i>Arrived here on scene,</i>

05:23.500 --> 05:26.583
<i>but police have already set up
a blockade here around the area.</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:29.186
<i>As you can see, we've gotten
just about as close as we can,</i>

05:29.260 --> 05:33.584
<i>but unfortunately, Montana, right now,
is on complete lock down.</i>

05:34.100 --> 05:39.186
<i>The object apparently touched down
40 minutes ago just north of I-94.</i>

05:39.300 --> 05:43.624
<i>We're waiting to hear if this is perhaps
an experimental vessel or...</i>

05:44.860 --> 05:46.100
<i>Hold on.</i>

05:46.860 --> 05:50.546
<i>I'm learning that
more objects like this have landed</i>

05:50.620 --> 05:54.147
<i>at as many as eight other locations
around the world.</i>

05:54.340 --> 05:55.501
<i>Yes. Can we?</i>

05:56.620 --> 05:59.624
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

06:00.180 --> 06:02.945
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

06:09.540 --> 06:10.826
Okay.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.424
That's... Class is dismissed.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.101
<i>For now,
we're simply asking for cooperation</i>

07:05.220 --> 07:07.461
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

07:07.540 --> 07:09.144
<i>So, you're saying it's not ours?</i>

07:09.220 --> 07:10.660
<i>Do you even know if it's from Earth?</i>

07:10.700 --> 07:13.988
<i>We're still collecting information.
We're coordinating with other countries.</i>

07:14.060 --> 07:18.304
<i>We are not the only ones
to have one of these in our backyard.</i>

07:18.380 --> 07:21.224
<i>If this is some sort of
peaceful first contact,</i>

07:21.300 --> 07:23.143
<i>why send 12?</i>

07:23.220 --> 07:24.984
<i>Why not just one?</i>

07:35.220 --> 07:37.507
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

07:48.340 --> 07:52.186
I don't know, Mom. I'm watching
the same news coverage you are.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.264
Well, Mom, please don't bother
with that channel.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.583
How many times do I have to
tell you those people are idiots?

08:05.540 --> 08:07.907
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.828
Okay, exactly. So...

08:12.420 --> 08:15.708
Me? Yeah.
You know me, I'm about the same.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.110
Mom, I'm fine.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.622
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.711
<i>And at around eight hours after landing,</i>

08:37.780 --> 08:40.943
<i>there are still no signs
of what might be called "first contact".</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:44.866
<i>Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall.</i>

08:44.940 --> 08:47.671
<i>Two are reported to have
penetrated Russian airspace,</i>

08:47.780 --> 08:51.227
<i>one in Siberia and the other
off the coast of the Black...</i>

08:51.300 --> 08:52.711
<i>suspended above the ocean.</i>

08:52.780 --> 08:56.580
<i>So far, there are 12 unidentified objects
spread across the globe.</i>

08:56.660 --> 08:59.391
<i>There is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

08:59.500 --> 09:02.026
<i>and no evidence
that the ships are even...</i>

09:02.100 --> 09:05.547
<i>who entertain the idea
that if it is a kind of vessel,</i>

09:06.660 --> 09:08.344
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

09:08.420 --> 09:11.867
<i>Regardless, we have a protocol
for scenarios like this, but...</i>

10:19.980 --> 10:21.903
<i>After Tuesday's extraordinary events,</i>

10:21.980 --> 10:24.904
<i>the President, this morning,
has declared a state of emergency,</i>

10:24.980 --> 10:27.745
<i>with as many as 5,000 National Guard
being deployed</i>

10:27.820 --> 10:29.663
<i>to the state of Montana alone.</i>

10:29.740 --> 10:31.822
<i>Borders are closed
and flights have been grounded,</i>

10:31.900 --> 10:33.664
<i>stranding millions of travelers.</i>

10:33.740 --> 10:37.301
<i>Panic buying of gas, water, and food
continues to escalate</i>

10:37.380 --> 10:40.509
<i>and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted all caps</i>

10:40.580 --> 10:42.821
<i>on overtime for law enforcement.</i>

10:42.900 --> 10:46.347
<i>The ATF has put a temporary ban
on new gun licenses,</i>

10:46.420 --> 10:50.266
<i>forcing many independent suppliers
of hunting equipment and firearms</i>

10:50.340 --> 10:52.342
<i>to close their doors to the public.</i>

10:52.420 --> 10:55.185
<i>Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...</i>

10:55.260 --> 10:56.307
Two days.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.791
<i>From the sight of the 12 UFO...</i>

10:57.860 --> 11:00.466
And already the public expects us
to know the answers.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.789
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.147
We never formally met,

11:06.220 --> 11:09.861
but two years ago, you did some
Farsi translations for Army intelligence.

11:10.780 --> 11:13.386
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.622
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.902
You are on the top of everyone's list
when it comes to translations.

11:23.780 --> 11:27.227
And you have another two years
in the SSBI.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.308
So, you still have top-secret clearance.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.029
That's why I'm in your office
and not at Berkeley.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.105
Okay.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.901
I have something
I need you to translate for me.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.025
<i>Why are you here?</i>

11:59.460 --> 12:01.667
<i>Can you... Can you understand us?</i>

12:09.380 --> 12:10.711
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

12:19.860 --> 12:21.271
Now you heard it.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.625
What do you make of it?

12:26.860 --> 12:28.191
Is that...

12:28.860 --> 12:30.146
Yes.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.620
How many?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.711
How many what?

12:36.540 --> 12:38.463
How many speaking?

12:42.300 --> 12:43.461
Two.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.500
Assume they were not speaking
at the same time.

12:48.980 --> 12:51.426
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

12:51.500 --> 12:54.390
How would you approach
translating this?

12:55.980 --> 12:57.391
Do you hear any words?

12:58.060 --> 12:59.186
Phrases?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.069
I don't... I don't know.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.910
So, what can you tell me?

13:06.180 --> 13:10.151
I can tell you that it's impossible
to translate from an audio file.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.826
I would need to be there
to interact with them.

13:13.740 --> 13:16.584
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.570
I didn't need it
because I already knew the language.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.628
But this, this is...

13:24.580 --> 13:26.264
I know what you're doing.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.820
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.210
It's all I can do to keep it
from turning into a tourist site

13:31.220 --> 13:32.250
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

13:32.260 --> 13:35.264
I'm just telling you what it would take
to do this job.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.024
This is not a negotiation.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.068
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.380
Good day.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.460
Colonel?

13:54.780 --> 13:58.546
You mentioned Berkeley,
are you going to ask Danvers next?

13:58.620 --> 13:59.620
Maybe.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.223
Before you commit to him,

14:02.300 --> 14:05.702
ask him the Sanskrit word for "war"
and its translation.

14:13.980 --> 14:17.507
<i>An agreement on sharing scientific
discoveries looks closer tonight,</i>

14:17.580 --> 14:20.663
<i>as Russia and China join talks
at the United Nations.</i>

14:21.220 --> 14:24.747
<i>Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis</i>

14:24.820 --> 14:28.666
<i>as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell over 2,000 points</i>

14:28.740 --> 14:31.141
<i>in its worst weekly decline in history.</i>

14:45.980 --> 14:47.106
Mornin'.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.306
Colonel.

14:49.460 --> 14:52.350
Gavisti. He says
it means "an argument".

14:52.420 --> 14:53.501
What do you say it means?

14:53.620 --> 14:55.349
"A desire for more cows."

14:56.060 --> 14:57.425
Pack your bags.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.226
All right, give me 20 minutes?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.631
We take off in 10.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.341
Dr. Banks. Right this way, please.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.384
<i>Contact and ready to approach...</i>

15:22.460 --> 15:24.940
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me
make sure you're properly secured.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.460
You okay?

16:11.420 --> 16:12.706
Thanks.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.822
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.</i>

16:18.660 --> 16:21.470
<i>"Language is the foundation
of civilization."</i>

16:21.540 --> 16:24.146
<i>"It is the glue
that holds a people together."</i>

16:24.220 --> 16:26.587
<i>"It is the first weapon
drawn in a conflict."</i>

16:28.100 --> 16:30.626
<i>Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.</i>

16:30.700 --> 16:32.350
<i>Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.</i>

16:32.420 --> 16:33.467
<i>It's quite a greeting.</i>

16:33.580 --> 16:35.105
<i>Yeah. Well, you wrote it.</i>

16:35.580 --> 16:36.627
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

16:37.020 --> 16:39.466
<i>It's the kind of thing you write
as a preface,</i>

16:39.540 --> 16:41.463
<i>dazzle them with the basics.</i>

16:41.780 --> 16:43.430
<i>Yeah. It's great.</i>

16:43.660 --> 16:44.786
<i>Even if it's wrong.</i>

16:45.860 --> 16:47.066
<i>It's wrong?</i>

16:47.140 --> 16:50.667
<i>Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language, it's science.</i>

16:51.500 --> 16:55.061
<i>Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.</i>

16:55.740 --> 16:56.770
<i>You'll be reporting to me,</i>

16:56.780 --> 16:58.980
<i>but you'll be working with him
when you're in the shell.</i>

16:59.620 --> 17:01.543
<i>That's what they're calling the UFO.</i>

17:01.620 --> 17:05.146
<i>Priority one. What do they want,
where are they from.</i>

17:05.220 --> 17:07.540
<i>And beyond that, how did they get here?</i>

17:07.619 --> 17:10.066
<i>Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel?</i>

17:10.140 --> 17:11.186
<i>Are they...</i>

17:11.260 --> 17:14.707
<i>I have a list of questions that,
you know, we can go over.</i>

17:14.780 --> 17:17.410
<i>Starting with a series of just
a "handshake" of binary sequences...</i>

17:17.420 --> 17:18.910
<i>How about we just talk to them</i>

17:18.980 --> 17:21.108
<i>before we start
throwing math problems at them?</i>

17:23.500 --> 17:25.468
<i>This is why you're both here.</i>

17:27.660 --> 17:29.150
<i>I'll bring the coffee.</i>

17:31.580 --> 17:33.264
<i>Coffee with some aliens.</i>

19:43.580 --> 19:46.789
All right. I want you
to take these two to Dr. Kettler.

19:46.860 --> 19:47.907
Yes, sir.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.505
Follow the captain to Medical.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.250
The procedure should take
just a few minutes,

19:51.260 --> 19:52.466
and then, we'll get started.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.223
These men are gonna
take care of your bags.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.506
I'll take your cell phones.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.301
Cell phones.

20:10.900 --> 20:11.901
Follow me.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.940
Put these on.
You're gonna wear them at all times.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.066
Not until they're here.
Great.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.945
Sir, they're here.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.701
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

20:32.980 --> 20:34.850
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.100
- Last night.
- Same.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.100
When's the last time
you did something stressful?

20:38.340 --> 20:39.341
Does now count?

20:41.100 --> 20:42.261
Just saying.

20:42.340 --> 20:46.106
Who was being carted off
in the medevac?

20:46.180 --> 20:48.990
Not everyone is able
to process experiences like this.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.903
I'm gonna get some blood from you

20:50.980 --> 20:54.348
and give you an immunization dose
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.785
Would you sign these, please?

20:55.860 --> 20:57.100
And roll up your sleeves.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.346
Either of you claustrophobic?

20:59.420 --> 21:00.750
- Nope.
- No.

21:00.820 --> 21:04.905
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies? Pregnant?

21:05.540 --> 21:06.621
No.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.668
The booster is a kick to your system,

21:08.740 --> 21:10.469
so you may experience
some side-effects,

21:10.540 --> 21:12.622
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

21:12.700 --> 21:15.180
a ringing in your ears
like you have tinnitus.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.311
You see what's happening to him?

21:28.380 --> 21:29.666
How does this even work?

21:29.740 --> 21:31.663
<i>The readings do not change, but...</i>

21:31.740 --> 21:34.141
<i>I don't know. It's like
we're insects on a piece of paper</i>

21:34.220 --> 21:36.905
<i>and they're easing us out of the house.</i>

21:36.980 --> 21:39.984
<i>At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,</i>

21:40.060 --> 21:43.507
<i>the gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

21:43.580 --> 21:46.470
Have you found
a scientific explanation for it?

21:46.580 --> 21:48.582
Like, is it for them?

21:48.660 --> 21:49.866
<i>No, we think it's for us.</i>

21:50.420 --> 21:52.661
<i>The air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,</i>

21:52.740 --> 21:55.664
<i>so after about two hours,
you run out of oxygen.</i>

21:55.740 --> 21:59.187
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

21:59.260 --> 22:00.386
Atmosphere.

22:02.540 --> 22:03.540
Excuse me?

22:03.580 --> 22:06.026
If their atmosphere
is different from Earth,

22:06.100 --> 22:07.545
it would certainly take hours

22:07.620 --> 22:09.622
to rebalance the O2 content
and pressure for us

22:09.700 --> 22:10.980
every time they open their door.

22:12.180 --> 22:14.420
So, you're saying they could
suffocate us if they wanted?

22:14.460 --> 22:16.269
This is Agent David Halpern
with the CIA.

22:17.180 --> 22:19.023
Let me get you two to your stations.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.100
Yes, sir.

22:20.140 --> 22:22.666
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

22:22.740 --> 22:25.869
What do they want,
where are they from, why they're here.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.385
- This is the priority.
- Yeah.

22:27.460 --> 22:31.385
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.
He'll be running this team here.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.667
Yeah, have they responded to anything?

22:33.740 --> 22:36.220
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

22:36.300 --> 22:38.450
We can't tell what they are saying
when they respond to "hello",

22:38.460 --> 22:41.464
so don't get ahead of yourself.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.821
What have you figured out?

22:45.900 --> 22:46.981
We're just getting started.

22:47.380 --> 22:49.189
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:49.260 --> 22:50.989
This is Dr. Louise Banks.

22:51.060 --> 22:52.170
She'll be heading your team.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.996
- Dr. Banks. It's a pleasure meeting you.
- Hi.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.182
Dr. Banks is taking over
the mission from Dr. Walker.

22:56.260 --> 22:58.183
- Nice to see you.
- Dr. Banks, glad to see you.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.308
That's your 15-minute warning.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.425
You scuba-dive before?

23:05.500 --> 23:07.628
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

23:07.700 --> 23:09.748
Nominal, these are just for safety.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.869
So, is there any physical contact
with the...

23:12.980 --> 23:15.984
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

23:16.060 --> 23:18.870
There's a wall, like a glass wall.
You can't get to them.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.186
So, what do they look like?

23:23.780 --> 23:25.384
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.989
Thank you. Turn this way, please.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.068
<i>All units, stand by. Over.</i>

23:45.660 --> 23:48.869
<i>The suits are clumsy at first,
but you get used to them.</i>

23:51.180 --> 23:52.705
<i>Load up in the second vehicle.</i>

23:54.220 --> 23:55.730
<i>Hurry up, hurry up. Bring it over here.</i>

23:55.740 --> 23:56.820
We're clear over here, sir.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.370
<i>All set, sir. This is the last box
for this truck. This truck's clear.</i>

23:59.380 --> 24:00.381
<i>Let's go!</i>

24:00.460 --> 24:01.905
<i>We'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

24:02.900 --> 24:04.300
<i>Make sure you hold on to something.</i>

24:10.020 --> 24:12.307
<i>We are now inside
the demilitarized zone.</i>

24:12.380 --> 24:15.190
<i>Raise 1.2 klicks. Over.
Copy, Alpha.</i>

24:15.260 --> 24:19.151
<i>We'll continue to monitor vitals
and signal clarity from operations.</i>

24:19.220 --> 24:21.666
<i>Air picket's in position
and fully operational.</i>

24:21.740 --> 24:24.186
<i>Countermeasures in place
and ready for deployment. Over.</i>

25:00.620 --> 25:04.102
<i>Copy, Condor.
We will observe, but not initiate. Over.</i>

25:04.700 --> 25:05.781
<i>Watch your step.</i>

25:07.100 --> 25:09.387
<i>We'll keep Alpha channel open. Over.</i>

25:09.460 --> 25:12.191
<i>Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.</i>

25:12.260 --> 25:13.546
<i>Every 18 hours,</i>

25:14.420 --> 25:16.149
<i>the door opens up at the bottom.</i>

25:18.980 --> 25:20.141
<i>That's where we go in.</i>

25:22.380 --> 25:23.905
<i>Red team on standby.</i>

25:30.100 --> 25:33.104
<i>Zero movement.
Alpha detail, clear to proceed. Over.</i>

25:33.420 --> 25:36.390
<i>Copy, Condor.
Beginning our ascent now. Over.</i>

25:42.300 --> 25:43.301
<i>Ten feet.</i>

25:47.740 --> 25:49.151
<i>Five feet.</i>

25:50.660 --> 25:53.231
<i>Two. One.</i>

26:10.860 --> 26:13.545
<i>Alpha, clear
to enter antechamber. Over.</i>

26:20.380 --> 26:23.589
<i>Copy, Condor.
Moving into position. Over.</i>

26:33.620 --> 26:35.429
<i>Thirty feet from target.</i>

26:35.500 --> 26:39.221
<i>Suit telemetry now full strength,
despite unknown interference. Over.</i>

26:46.460 --> 26:49.225
<i>Five feet. Two, one.</i>

27:11.900 --> 27:15.427
<i>Oxygen level, 20.3%.
No known contaminates. Over.</i>

27:15.700 --> 27:16.747
<i>Vitals normal.</i>

27:18.980 --> 27:20.789
<i>Gravity at 0.97.</i>

27:29.540 --> 27:31.668
<i>Radio signal strength decreasing.</i>

27:31.780 --> 27:35.262
<i>90%. 85%. Fluctuating...</i>

27:53.300 --> 27:55.029
<i>Yeah, that just happened.</i>

28:15.540 --> 28:18.544
<i>All right, let's move. Time is wasting.</i>

28:18.660 --> 28:21.061
<i>You ready?</i>

28:21.940 --> 28:23.226
<i>Let's do it.</i>

28:23.300 --> 28:26.668
<i>Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks. Over.</i>

28:29.420 --> 28:32.902
<i>Radio signal strength 75%. Over.</i>

28:32.980 --> 28:35.870
<i>Landed. Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over.</i>

28:37.940 --> 28:39.066
<i>It's all good, sir.</i>

28:39.220 --> 28:40.984
<i>You can proceed.
Stand by.</i>

28:41.580 --> 28:42.820
<i>Okay, bring it up.</i>

28:48.660 --> 28:49.661
<i>Vitals in line.</i>

28:49.740 --> 28:53.347
<i>Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.</i>

28:55.100 --> 28:56.261
<i>You okay?</i>

28:59.500 --> 29:00.500
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:01.860 --> 29:03.021
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

29:07.420 --> 29:08.706
<i>You can do this.</i>

29:09.340 --> 29:10.340
<i>Come on.</i>

29:10.700 --> 29:12.900
<i>I don't know, I... I think...</i>

29:21.300 --> 29:22.300
<i>Grab her.</i>

29:35.420 --> 29:37.422
<i>Dr. Donnelly, are you all right?</i>

29:38.380 --> 29:40.542
<i>Dr. Donnelly. You good?</i>

29:42.300 --> 29:46.146
<i>Dr. Donnelly, are you all right?
Please respond. Over.</i>

29:46.620 --> 29:47.620
Yeah.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.420
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

29:58.100 --> 30:00.300
<i>We're gonna go down there,</i>

30:00.380 --> 30:01.950
<i>and you're gonna start your job.</i>

30:02.020 --> 30:03.020
<i>Okay.</i>

30:03.100 --> 30:04.500
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

30:04.600 --> 30:05.950
<i>Everybody, move out.</i>

30:05.980 --> 30:07.900
<i>Alpha detail is in position.</i>

30:08.060 --> 30:09.505
<i>Team is in position.</i>

30:09.900 --> 30:11.265
<i>We're on the move.</i>

30:57.020 --> 30:59.182
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.</i>

30:59.620 --> 31:01.987
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

31:22.060 --> 31:24.631
<i>Oxygen level, 21.3%. Over.</i>

31:34.780 --> 31:37.431
<i>So, what happens now?</i>

31:40.460 --> 31:41.825
<i>They arrive.</i>

32:45.900 --> 32:47.061
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

32:52.380 --> 32:53.541
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

32:55.700 --> 32:57.065
<i>You can start.</i>

32:58.980 --> 33:01.950
<i>Alpha detail, proceed directly
through the decontamination...</i>

33:02.020 --> 33:03.465
<i>to the inner airlock.</i>

33:03.540 --> 33:07.147
<i>Do not stop until you have passed
through the airlock doors.</i>

33:07.220 --> 33:09.188
<i>Do not attempt to remove
the Hazmat suit</i>

33:09.260 --> 33:11.866
<i>without proper assistance
of authorized personnel.</i>

33:11.940 --> 33:15.626
<i>Repeat. Hazmat suits without
assistance of authorized personnel.</i>

33:15.700 --> 33:17.862
Wait, just a minute. A minute.
All right.

33:17.940 --> 33:19.305
Keep your head low.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.060
Clear.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.551
All right.
Step on out, please.

33:33.820 --> 33:34.821
Now hold that.

33:38.420 --> 33:39.421
Am I fired?

33:40.140 --> 33:41.471
You did better than the last guy.

33:43.220 --> 33:45.382
That doesn't make me feel any better.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.902
You both have till 0200 hours
to figure something out.

33:49.980 --> 33:51.141
Okay, what happens then?

33:52.300 --> 33:53.665
You go back in.

34:28.139 --> 34:30.949
<i>Violence continues
to spread across the US today</i>

34:31.020 --> 34:32.862
<i>in the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

34:32.940 --> 34:35.909
<i>The President has declared
a mandatory dusk-to-dawn curfew</i>

34:35.980 --> 34:38.027
<i>after the crackdown
by the National Guard</i>

34:38.100 --> 34:41.581
<i>failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.</i>

34:41.659 --> 34:45.949
<i>In North Dakota, 144 members
of the St. Lawrence Pentecostal Cult</i>

34:46.020 --> 34:48.705
<i>are feared dead
after they set their compound ablaze.</i>

34:48.860 --> 34:51.784
<i>Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens</i>

34:51.860 --> 34:56.627
<i>set in motion a prophecy that
12 sets of 12 should "follow the lamb".</i>

35:06.340 --> 35:08.741
<i>And this is Seven-November.
Roger, stand by...</i>

35:08.860 --> 35:10.100
<i>Got that request...</i>

35:14.020 --> 35:16.990
We're up in 15. You got any new intel?

35:17.060 --> 35:19.904
<i>Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.</i>

35:20.580 --> 35:21.866
Where does that get you?

35:22.300 --> 35:25.065
<i>Well, they play audio back at us
from an unseen source.</i>

35:26.300 --> 35:27.506
Audio of what?

35:28.060 --> 35:32.509
<i>It's bits of conversation from the room,
random clips of dialogue.</i>

35:32.580 --> 35:35.265
<i>Really, we... we have nothing.</i>

35:36.820 --> 35:41.826
<i>T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.</i>

35:42.220 --> 35:43.585
<i>Are you receiving my signal?</i>

35:44.260 --> 35:45.420
<i>Yes. It's sending.</i>

35:45.500 --> 35:47.500
<i>Okay, thanks.
Okay. Good hunting.</i>

35:47.580 --> 35:48.580
<i>Heading out.</i>

35:48.620 --> 35:50.340
<i>Checking in for radio.
Are you receiving me?</i>

35:50.740 --> 35:52.105
<i>You're coming in loud and clear.</i>

35:53.940 --> 35:54.940
<i>Good luck, Doctor.</i>

36:04.540 --> 36:10.388
<i>T-minus nine minutes to shell access.</i>

36:10.460 --> 36:11.700
<i>What's that for?</i>

36:12.060 --> 36:13.300
<i>A visual aid.</i>

36:14.580 --> 36:18.187
<i>Look, I'm never going to be able to
speak their words if they are talking.</i>

36:18.260 --> 36:20.130
<i>But they might have
some sort of written language</i>

36:20.140 --> 36:23.542
<i>or basis for visual communication.</i>

36:23.620 --> 36:25.543
<i>Okay. Let's get started.</i>

36:35.820 --> 36:36.867
<i>Human.</i>

37:05.020 --> 37:06.021
<i>"Human"</i>

37:10.020 --> 37:11.306
<i>I'm human.</i>

37:12.660 --> 37:13.866
<i>What are you?</i>

37:25.300 --> 37:26.506
<i>Human.</i>

38:14.700 --> 38:15.747
<i>Affirmative, Alpha...</i>

38:16.940 --> 38:17.941
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

38:18.260 --> 38:19.591
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

38:19.700 --> 38:21.668
<i>Yes, sir.
It's uploading back to base camp.</i>

38:23.300 --> 38:24.301
<i>Louise.</i>

38:25.100 --> 38:26.511
<i>That's incredible.</i>

38:40.740 --> 38:41.741
<i>Human.</i>

38:44.340 --> 38:45.387
<i>Human.</i>

38:46.940 --> 38:47.941
<i>Human.</i>

38:59.620 --> 39:00.701
<i>Okay-</i>

39:01.060 --> 39:02.391
<i>Okay, slow down, fellas.</i>

39:03.380 --> 39:04.381
<i>Slow down.</i>

39:21.820 --> 39:24.266
<i>I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,</i>

39:24.340 --> 39:26.820
<i>but, Dr. Banks,
is this really the right approach?</i>

39:27.300 --> 39:30.747
<i>Trying to teach 'em
how to speak and read?</i>

39:30.820 --> 39:31.981
<i>That's gotta take longer.</i>

39:32.060 --> 39:34.631
<i>You're wrong. It's faster.</i>

39:37.580 --> 39:41.187
Everything you do in there
I have to explain to a room full of men

39:41.300 --> 39:45.385
whose first and last question is,
"How can this be used against us?"

39:45.740 --> 39:48.346
So, you're gonna
have to give me more than that.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.231
Kangaroo.

39:52.300 --> 39:53.711
What is that?

39:53.780 --> 39:55.191
In 1770,

39:55.260 --> 39:58.582
Captain James Cook's ship ran
aground off the coast of Australia,

39:58.660 --> 40:02.267
and he led a party into the country
and they met the Aboriginal people.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.389
One of the sailors pointed
at the animals that hop around

40:05.460 --> 40:07.224
and put their babies in their pouch,

40:07.300 --> 40:10.110
and he asked what they were,
and the Aborigines said, "Kanguru".

40:12.980 --> 40:14.220
And the point is?

40:14.540 --> 40:18.386
It wasn't until later that they learned
that "kanguru" means "I don't understand".

40:18.460 --> 40:22.101
So, I need this so that we
don't misinterpret things in there,

40:22.180 --> 40:25.024
otherwise this is
gonna take 10 times as long.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.429
I could sell that for now.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.588
But I need you
to submit your vocabulary words

40:31.660 --> 40:32.741
before the next session.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.380
Fair.

40:34.420 --> 40:37.026
And remember
what happened to the Aborigines.

40:37.340 --> 40:40.662
A more advanced race
nearly wiped 'em out.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.189
It's a good story.

40:50.260 --> 40:51.386
Thanks.

40:52.220 --> 40:53.745
It's not true.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.663
But it proves my point.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.189
<i>We think we were able to reproduce</i>

41:15.260 --> 41:17.866
<i>some prime number sequences
back at them.</i>

41:17.980 --> 41:19.106
<i>So, that's something.</i>

41:19.180 --> 41:21.228
Well, congratulations. You're a parrot.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.826
<i>Well, it's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard.</i>

41:23.900 --> 41:26.824
<i>Don't you see?
They can't seem to follow our algebra.</i>

41:27.260 --> 41:30.946
<i>But complex behaviors? That clicks.</i>

41:34.300 --> 41:37.190
Well, that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

41:42.060 --> 41:45.587
The problem is, not everyone shares
our policy of being open with the aliens.

41:45.660 --> 41:47.264
Have you met General Shang?

41:48.780 --> 41:50.225
Call sign for him is "Big Domino".

41:50.300 --> 41:53.702
Whatever Shang does,
at least four other nations will follow.

41:53.780 --> 41:56.430
- Louise, you have to gain ground today.
- Okay.

41:56.500 --> 41:59.070
- You have a vocabulary list for me?
- I do.

42:04.900 --> 42:08.109
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

42:08.180 --> 42:11.070
Yes, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

42:11.140 --> 42:13.268
and then introduce pronouns later.

42:13.380 --> 42:14.984
These are all grade-school words.

42:15.860 --> 42:17.669
"Eat". "Walk".

42:19.900 --> 42:21.345
Help me understand.

42:22.300 --> 42:23.426
Okay.

42:27.580 --> 42:29.344
No, no, no, not the top!

42:34.780 --> 42:37.067
Okay, this is
where you wanna get to, right?

42:37.140 --> 42:38.585
- That is the question.
- Okay.

42:38.660 --> 42:42.426
So, first we need to make sure
that they understand what a question is.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.101
Okay? The nature
of a request for information

42:47.180 --> 42:48.625
along with a response.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.943
Then, we need to clarify

42:52.020 --> 42:56.184
the difference between
a specific "you" and a collective "you",

42:56.260 --> 43:00.663
because we don't want to know
why Joe Alien is here.

43:00.740 --> 43:03.220
We want to know why they all landed.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.942
And "purpose" requires
an understanding of intent.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.785
We need to find out,
do they make conscious choices

43:09.860 --> 43:12.067
or is their motivation so instinctive

43:12.140 --> 43:15.223
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all.

43:15.300 --> 43:19.430
And... And biggest of all, we need to
have enough vocabulary with them

43:19.500 --> 43:21.502
that we understand their answer.

43:23.620 --> 43:25.384
I get it.

43:25.500 --> 43:27.104
Stick to your list.

43:27.980 --> 43:32.508
Just don't add anything to it.

43:46.740 --> 43:51.382
<i>Gravity, 0.97.
Oxygen level, 21.4%. Over.</i>

43:51.460 --> 43:53.701
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the main.</i>

43:53.780 --> 43:56.181
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

43:56.260 --> 43:57.591
Let's get started.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.066
<i>"Louise"</i>

44:10.100 --> 44:11.943
<i>Louise. I am Louise.</i>

44:19.020 --> 44:20.510
<i>What is that?</i>

44:22.580 --> 44:24.184
<i>Is that a new symbol? I can't tell.</i>

44:24.260 --> 44:27.184
<i>I don't know.
I think it's the symbol for "human" again.</i>

44:27.260 --> 44:31.549
<i>It just has a little curl on the end,
maybe to indicate a question.</i>

44:31.620 --> 44:32.781
<i>I don't know.</i>

44:33.220 --> 44:34.460
<i>I don't know, Louise.</i>

44:35.220 --> 44:37.109
<i>I think they're getting confused.</i>

44:37.220 --> 44:40.508
<i>Dr. Banks, perhaps we should
move on to the next word.</i>

44:59.460 --> 45:00.507
<i>Dr. Banks?</i>

45:02.580 --> 45:04.230
<i>It's okay, Nate.</i>
What's going <i>on?</i>

45:04.300 --> 45:06.382
<i>Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?</i>

45:06.500 --> 45:08.741
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you insane?

45:08.820 --> 45:10.060
They need to see me.

45:10.580 --> 45:12.344
<i>She's taking off her Hazmat suit.
Dr. Banks!</i>

45:14.700 --> 45:15.906
<i>Is it okay?</i>

45:15.980 --> 45:17.345
<i>You're risking contamination.</i>

45:18.060 --> 45:19.346
They need to see me.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.421
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

45:21.860 --> 45:22.861
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

45:22.940 --> 45:24.260
<i>She's walking towards the screen.</i>

45:27.140 --> 45:28.744
<i>Should we abort?</i>

45:28.820 --> 45:31.426
<i>Request noted. Stand by for frag order.</i>

45:31.500 --> 45:32.547
<i>Go back to your stations.</i>

46:48.180 --> 46:50.501
Now that's a proper introduction.

46:50.580 --> 46:51.661
Okay.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.067
"Louise"

47:07.300 --> 47:08.950
I am Louise.

47:09.620 --> 47:11.907
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

47:15.780 --> 47:16.941
Yeah.

47:20.140 --> 47:21.301
Louise.

47:25.980 --> 47:27.027
<i>Screw it.</i>

47:31.740 --> 47:33.310
<i>Everybody dies, right?</i>

47:36.100 --> 47:38.831
<i>Sir, Donnelly is taking off
his Hazmat suit.</i>

47:38.900 --> 47:40.345
<i>Permission to abort?</i>

47:40.940 --> 47:42.385
<i>Continue the session.</i>

47:58.900 --> 47:59.981
Ian.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.786
Louise.

48:03.660 --> 48:04.707
You.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.831
Who are you?

48:35.260 --> 48:36.910
I think those are their names.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.111
They have names.

48:42.940 --> 48:44.829
So, what are we gonna call them?

48:45.500 --> 48:46.500
I don't know.

48:48.020 --> 48:50.020
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

48:53.140 --> 48:54.140
Yeah.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.430
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.100
I like it.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.983
<i>Team 1, exit your vehicle</i>

49:17.060 --> 49:20.223
<i>and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.</i>

49:26.060 --> 49:29.951
<i>Leave your respirator on
until you reach the equipment room.</i>

49:58.740 --> 49:59.946
I know.

50:06.900 --> 50:12.304
<i>Team 2, exit your vehicles and continue
to the decontamination tent.</i>

50:13.660 --> 50:15.185
<i>Leave your respirators on</i>

50:15.260 --> 50:18.389
<i>and do not hesitate
until you reach the equipment room.</i>

50:21.940 --> 50:23.146
<i>How do you feel?</i>

50:24.220 --> 50:25.585
Overworked.

50:26.300 --> 50:29.782
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you,
you're putting yourself at risk.

50:31.020 --> 50:33.785
There are no signs
of radiation poisoning yet.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.749
We'll see how your blood tests look.

50:36.380 --> 50:38.223
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

50:38.300 --> 50:39.586
Okay.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.225
No radiation.

50:42.300 --> 50:43.904
Nothing else we can detect either,

50:43.980 --> 50:46.460
but I'd give 'em
a strong cocktail regardless.

50:46.540 --> 50:49.146
It's the first time
we've made significant progress.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.345
All right.

50:52.860 --> 50:54.660
We'll take the risk.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.140
- Okay, honey...
- <i>What is going on there?</i>

50:57.220 --> 50:59.746
- Honey.
- <i>Is there anything you can tell me?</i>

50:59.820 --> 51:02.744
No... you don't need to worry, okay?

51:02.820 --> 51:05.221
- How can <i>I</i> not worry?
- Just calm down.

51:05.300 --> 51:06.381
Just calm down.

51:07.260 --> 51:10.343
<i>Becky asked me if
the monsters are going to kill Daddy.</i>

51:10.420 --> 51:12.787
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.270
<i>Just stay safe.</i>

51:17.340 --> 51:18.580
You don't need to worry.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.549
<i>Please, I'm so scared.</i>

51:23.700 --> 51:27.944
<i>All junior xenolinguistics
and science personnel must observe</i>

51:28.020 --> 51:30.626
<i>general curfew
unless expressly authorized</i>

51:30.700 --> 51:33.385
<i>for extended work hours by unit COs.</i>

51:33.460 --> 51:37.067
<i>Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.</i>

51:37.620 --> 51:41.750
<i>Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff.</i>

51:41.820 --> 51:46.223
<i>Effective immediately, midnight rations
will be sewed all night.</i>

52:34.580 --> 52:38.346
<i>Here are some of the many things
we don't know about heptapods.</i>

52:38.420 --> 52:41.867
<i>Greek. Hepta, "Seven". Pod, "Foot".</i>

52:41.940 --> 52:44.261
<i>"Seven feet". Heptapod.</i>

52:45.940 --> 52:47.305
<i>Who are they?</i>

52:48.700 --> 52:51.067
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

52:51.140 --> 52:52.824
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

52:52.900 --> 52:55.267
<i>outside being able
to see them and hear them,</i>

52:55.340 --> 52:58.469
<i>the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

53:00.340 --> 53:03.549
<i>The chemical composition
of their spaceship is unknown.</i>

53:03.620 --> 53:07.670
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

53:07.740 --> 53:10.425
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

53:10.500 --> 53:12.070
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

53:12.700 --> 53:17.342
<i>The air between the shells is untroubled
by sonic emission or light wave.</i>

53:19.300 --> 53:22.031
<i>Are they scientists or tourists?</i>

53:22.100 --> 53:25.468
<i>If they're scientists, they don't seem
to ask a lot of questions.</i>

53:28.500 --> 53:30.423
<i>Why did they park where they did?</i>

53:31.140 --> 53:34.144
<i>The world's most decorated experts
can't crack that one.</i>

53:34.660 --> 53:37.789
<i>The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on Earth</i>

53:37.860 --> 53:39.828
<i>with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.</i>

53:40.660 --> 53:42.503
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

53:42.580 --> 53:46.107
<i>The next most plausible theory is that
Sheena Easton had a hit song</i>

53:46.180 --> 53:49.389
<i>at each of these sites in 1980.
So, we just don't know.</i>

53:52.340 --> 53:54.308
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

53:54.860 --> 53:57.340
<i>Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.</i>

53:57.980 --> 54:01.587
<i>The first breakthrough was to discover
that there's no correlation</i>

54:01.700 --> 54:04.909
<i>between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.</i>

54:20.980 --> 54:25.702
<i>Unlike all written human languages,
their writing is semasiographic.</i>

54:25.780 --> 54:29.148
<i>It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.</i>

54:34.220 --> 54:38.225
<i>Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted opportunity,</i>

54:38.420 --> 54:40.661
<i>passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

54:46.420 --> 54:48.024
<i>We have our friends in Pakistan</i>

54:48.100 --> 54:52.310
<i>to thank for their study
of how heptapods write.</i>

54:52.380 --> 54:56.590
<i>Because, unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.</i>

54:59.260 --> 55:01.706
<i>Like their ship or their bodies,</i>

55:01.780 --> 55:04.989
<i>their written language has
no forward or backward direction.</i>

55:05.660 --> 55:08.823
<i>Linguists call this
"nonlinear orthography",</i>

55:08.900 --> 55:12.347
<i>which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"</i>

55:14.460 --> 55:17.145
<i>Imagine you wanted to
write a sentence using two hands,</i>

55:17.220 --> 55:18.949
<i>starting from either side.</i>

55:19.940 --> 55:22.625
<i>You would have to know
each word you wanted to use</i>

55:22.740 --> 55:25.584
<i>as well as
how much space that it would occupy.</i>

55:27.500 --> 55:29.628
<i>A heptapod can write
a complex sentence</i>

55:29.700 --> 55:31.828
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

55:31.900 --> 55:34.630
<i>It's taken us a month to make
the simplest reply.</i>

55:35.340 --> 55:38.105
<i>Next, expanding vocabulary.</i>

55:38.180 --> 55:41.309
<i>Louise thinks it could easily take
another month to be ready for that.</i>

55:59.140 --> 56:00.140
Hey...

56:01.400 --> 56:02.700
Oh, hey.

56:02.820 --> 56:04.709
Weber's looking for you.

56:05.620 --> 56:08.385
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

56:09.860 --> 56:11.100
Come on up.

56:12.020 --> 56:13.101
Come on.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.261
Thanks.

56:17.540 --> 56:18.985
Nice out here, huh?

56:19.900 --> 56:21.664
Yeah, it's a nice view.

56:22.540 --> 56:24.144
Away from the noise.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.628
You know, I was just thinking about you.

56:32.300 --> 56:34.428
You approach language
like a mathematician.

56:34.500 --> 56:36.070
You know that, right?

56:38.140 --> 56:40.222
I will take that as a compliment.

56:40.620 --> 56:41.701
Yeah, well, it is.

56:44.180 --> 56:45.306
It's...

56:45.500 --> 56:48.071
I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

56:48.140 --> 56:50.108
that I didn't even know existed.

56:50.180 --> 56:51.466
Say what?

56:53.940 --> 56:55.863
I guess that's why I'm single.

56:55.980 --> 56:59.143
Trust me, you can
understand communication

56:59.220 --> 57:00.949
and still end up single.

57:10.220 --> 57:13.702
I feel like
everything that happens in there

57:13.780 --> 57:15.987
comes down to the two of us.

57:17.420 --> 57:21.061
Yeah, it's a good thing though, right?
You and I?

57:24.620 --> 57:27.544
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

57:28.420 --> 57:30.184
I'm glad I got you.

57:41.660 --> 57:44.789
<i>Tonight, the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.</i>

57:45.380 --> 57:49.146
<i>Biological contamination is
a major risk factor at the Montana site,</i>

57:49.260 --> 57:51.547
<i>so say environmental pressure groups.</i>

57:51.620 --> 57:53.702
<i>Eight-hundred thousand
march on Washington</i>

57:53.780 --> 57:56.431
<i>to protest
the government's handling of the crisis.</i>

57:56.500 --> 57:59.106
<i>All this, and more special coverage.</i>

58:00.980 --> 58:03.347
<i>First contact with whoever it is
that is inside that thing,</i>

58:03.420 --> 58:05.370
<i>and who do we have running the show?
The government.</i>

58:05.380 --> 58:07.348
<i>That's right, folks.
The same government</i>

58:07.420 --> 58:10.185
<i>who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.</i>

58:10.260 --> 58:11.261
<i>Look at these people.</i>

58:11.340 --> 58:13.229
<i>Most of them don't even have guns.</i>

58:13.460 --> 58:15.588
<i>We could be facing
a full-scale invasion,</i>

58:15.660 --> 58:17.583
<i>and our president
is just willing to sit back</i>

58:17.660 --> 58:19.583
<i>and let them waltz in
and take our country.</i>

58:19.660 --> 58:22.061
<i>We are falling asleep
at the wheel, people.</i>

58:22.140 --> 58:24.029
<i>You know what I'm talking about.
I know you do.</i>

58:24.100 --> 58:26.387
<i>What if the smartest thing
we could do right now</i>

58:26.460 --> 58:28.508
<i>would be to give them a show of force?</i>

58:28.580 --> 58:30.662
<i>I'm talking about a shot across the bow.</i>

58:30.740 --> 58:31.810
<i>I wanna hear what you think.</i>

58:31.820 --> 58:34.620
<i>Caller number one, you're on the air.
What do you think about all this?</i>

59:01.140 --> 59:02.665
<i>What's this word?</i>

59:18.860 --> 59:20.146
<i>"Planet".</i>

59:20.860 --> 59:22.146
<i>No, no.</i>

59:25.780 --> 59:28.863
That's, like... The Earth is a planet.

59:29.860 --> 59:32.784
<i>Want to see my project
from Miss Garriott's class?</i>

59:32.860 --> 59:34.191
Yeah, little nose.

59:37.780 --> 59:39.748
We had to make up our own TV show.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.031
If we had one.

59:43.100 --> 59:45.421
And who are those two people?
That's you and Dad.

59:46.420 --> 59:49.185
<i>The show</i> is called
<i>Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.</i>

59:51.420 --> 59:53.070
Well, it's lovely.

59:57.500 --> 59:58.626
Okay.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.782
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.464
I know. I'm not.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.589
'Cause we both love you very much.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.630
I know. It's just a cartoon. Not real.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.901
<i>Louise?</i>

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.711
You all right?

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.066
Yeah.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.911
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.906
I'm not sure it's something I can explain.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.381
When was your last checkup
with Dr. Kettler?

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.346
I'm okay.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.630
I'm gonna get some air.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.420
I'm okay.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.100
- All right.
- I'm fine. Yeah.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.825
<i>How you feeling?</i>

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.508
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.821
Yeah.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.827
You know, I was doing some reading
about this idea that

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.981
if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.791
that you can actually rewire your brain.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.306
Yeah, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.820
The theory that...

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.582
It's the theory that

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.267
the language you speak
determines how you think and...

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.503
Yeah. It affects how you see everything.
It was...

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.945
I'm curious,

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.182
are you dreaming in their language?

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.866
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.227
I don't think that
that makes me unfit to do this job.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:01.621
Did you sleep?

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.506
A little.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.546
Do you know Mandarin?

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:11.385
It is shifting.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.540
The voice you're about to hear

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.422
belongs to China's military chief,

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.671
General Shang.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.985
Pull it up.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.940
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.550
if you want to look.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.911
Wait, go back.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.945
Stop.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.865
He's saying that each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.627
And back again. And play.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.071
"Our science team is attempting
to decode the sets."

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.782
"Sets". I don't know what that means.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.110
Something about advantage.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.706
"Suits, honor, and flowers."

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.220
I don't...

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.464
I don't know, that's all.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.702
I don't know what it means either.

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.545
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.509
And now, Russia is following suit.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.984
Shang's about to start something.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.462
Following suit, "suits".

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.191
Suits. Honor. Flowers.

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.945
Colonel, those are all
tile sets in mahjong.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.151
God, are they...

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.784
Are they using a game
to converse with their heptapods?

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.184
Maybe. Why?

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:44.060
Well, let's say that I taught them chess
instead of English.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.904
Every conversation would be a game,

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:49.302
every idea expressed
through opposition, victory, defeat.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.506
You see the problem?

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.910
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.431
Everything's a nail.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.462
We need to ask the big question.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.026
Ready or not.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.427
Right, so...

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.468
Okay, let me know
what temperature you use, okay?

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.391
No, this is the same as before.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.027
See.
I...

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.185
Yeah, no, but between three and four.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.710
All right, time to go.
Okay.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.710
<i>Ninety-six minutes remaining
in the session. Over.</i>

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.546
Okay.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:50.821
Heptapod's purpose.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.071
Heptapod purpose. Earth.
What is your purpose?

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.826
Do we only have Costello?

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.069
Okay. There you are.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.620
What does it say?

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:54.985
"Offer weapon."

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.066
But you saw what they wrote.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.530
Using a word
they don't fully understand.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.010
It could be just a request.
Or a warning.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.067
Enough!

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:06.621
Louise?

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.388
We don't know if they understand

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.940
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.543
Our language, like our culture,
is messy,

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:16.230
and sometimes one can be both.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.907
I think it's quite possible that they're
asking us to offer them something,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.268
not the other way around,
like the first part of a trade.

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.663
So, how do we clarify their intentions
beyond those two words?

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.111
Well, I go back in.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.342
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.570
It's more complicated than that.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.060
How is it more complicated than that?

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.982
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.542
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.170
So, we aren't sharing it
with our enemies.

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:51.511
We have to consider the idea

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.810
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.107
until only one faction prevails.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.341
There's no evidence of that.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.785
Sure there is.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.703
Just grab a history book.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.705
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.862
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.026
Yeah.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.385
We're a world with no single leader.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.939
It's impossible to deal with
just one of us.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.703
And with the word "weapon" now...

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.779
Halpern.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.060
Yes, sir.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:42.384
Copy that. Waiting for instructions.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.189
No confirmation yet.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.705
Standing by.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.185
Anything?

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.031
What did they say?

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:53.569
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking to anyone.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.504
Whatever they learned
in their last session has them spooked.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.501
Yes, sir.

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:02.390
We have orders to do the same.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.661
Wait, these are our allies.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.890
Colonel, you can't shut us down.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.629
- Put us on radio silence.
- Do it.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.420
We received a message from the...

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.904
Damn it!

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.930
We need to be talking to each other.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.466
You wanna talk to them?
Find out what this means.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.908
<i>Base-camp talk is now offline.</i>

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.871
<i>All interpreters...
No confirmation. They're offline.</i>

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:28.910
<i>Stand down
and report to unit coordinators.</i>

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.028
We've never re-entered
a session before.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.785
Look, Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:37.749
We've just gotta step on it, all right?

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:39.991
<i>"Use weapon."</i>

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.701
<i>This is the alien message</i>

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.703
<i>said to have provoked
the Chinese government</i>

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:47.466
<i>to withdraw their scientists
from the international mission today.</i>

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.381
<i>In a statement, General Shang said,</i>

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.862
<i>"China no longer trusts the aliens
who want to divide us."</i>

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.430
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.104
<i>China has asked for immediate talks
at the UN.</i>

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.911
<i>Alpha one-niner, this is Condor. Over.</i>

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.066
<i>Alpha one-niner, this is Condor.</i>

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.665
<i>Come in. Over.</i>

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.184
<i>Captain Marks, Condor.</i>

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.423
<i>Not receiving transmission.
Squelch twice if you hear mine.</i>

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.023
<i>Captain Marks, all escort groups
are ordered to cease all activity.</i>

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.102
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.540
We just need to ask one question.

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.868
Dr. Banks, the session is finished.
You can't...

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.530
You can't go back in. It's dangerous.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.330
Look, we just need five minutes.
Don't sweat it.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.308
Marks, let them go.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.904
Hey, Abbott.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.070
So, what are we calling this,
session 37?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.150
No, 36, part two.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.386
Okay.

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.901
Yeah.

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.741
Why they on their own?

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.788
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.669
The escort units are not responding, sir.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.741
Why not?

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.431
Send security.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:50.147
"Offer weapon. Question mark."

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.307
Are you offering us something?

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.991
"Technology. Apparatus. Method"?

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.548
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.100
This segment, it's a lot busier.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.946
"Give."

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.311
"Technology."

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.941
"NOW."

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.304
What's he doing?

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.470
<i>Captain, on your 10.</i>

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.511
<i>Mutineers are to be apprehended
without engaging.</i>

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.385
<i>We don't want to risk
antagonizing our visitors. Over.</i>

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.349
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.
T-minus four minutes remaining.</i>

01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.030
<i>We need to see this through.</i>

01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.790
<i>Okay, this is it. Lock and load.</i>

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.783
<i>We just need to hold them off
until it's done.</i>

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.386
<i>Copy that. Warning shots
and suppressive fire only.</i>

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.700
<i>Load up and get to cover.</i>

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.703
<i>Stay fresh and we can avoid casualties.</i>

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.391
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.705
Can you even do that?

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.745
I don't know.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.545
I can't do it with both hands.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.621
Louise.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.021
What is that?

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.831
Free fire!
Over there! I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.546
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.110
You suffered a concussion.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.705
Just lay back.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.984
How are you feeling?

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.025
How is Ian?

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.063
Same as you. He's okay.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.861
Who...

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.790
Who did this?

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.905
Some soldiers.
Been watching too much TV.

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.145
What is that?

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.302
Now, take it easy. Take it easy.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.144
The site's no longer secure.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.790
We're standing by to evacuate.

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.346
Where's Ian?

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.510
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.584
But he wouldn't leave
until he knew you were okay.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.664
The whole tent is on the clock

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.471
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.384
This is all of it.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.504
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:29.742
Not as far as we can see.

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.024
You see something?

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.340
I don't know yet.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.344
I'm gonna need my team
to get together with Louise's team.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.751
I need everybody working on this.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.821
We cannot leave.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:41.906
Glad to see you're awake.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.810
We need to go back in and we need
to explain to them this wasn't our fault.

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.050
We can't go back inside.
We have to tell them... We have to.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.028
What happened in there was an attack.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.024
We can hope for the best, but
I have orders to prepare for retaliation.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.386
We may have to evacuate.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.351
No, that's the wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.302
Well, they're not leaving.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.141
Why does this feel worse?

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.543
<i>China is on the offensive.</i>

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.748
<i>They're positioning their military</i>

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:46.970
<i>to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.</i>

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.311
<i>And if this happens,</i>

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.068
<i>we can't sit around waiting
for retaliation, so get prepared.</i>

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.188
<i>The Air Force and infantry
are standing by.</i>

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.261
Yes, sir.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.149
<i>Tonight, China becomes
the first world power</i>

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.461
<i>to declare war against the aliens.</i>

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:07.907
<i>Following the failure of
diplomatic efforts at the United Nations,</i>

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.348
<i>China has confirmed that
its language experts have, tonight,</i>

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.464
<i>delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.</i>

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.668
<i>In a televised statement,
General Shang,</i>

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.902
<i>Chairman of
the People's Liberation Army,</i>

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.666
<i>said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory</i>

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.424
<i>or face destruction.</i>

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:27.709
<i>And he urged all other world leaders
to unite with China</i>

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.306
<i>and take a similar stance.</i>

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.748
<i>With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,</i>

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:38.906
<i>Pakistan, Russia, and Sudan are
thought to be following China's lead.</i>

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.468
It can't be random.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.982
It's going to take us years.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.949
<i>What's this term here?</i>

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.271
<i>Mom.</i>

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.381
Mom.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.026
Sweetie?

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.546
What's this term for that thing like a...

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.826
Like a technical term?

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.908
Where we make a deal and
we both get something out of it?

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.550
"Compromise."

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.746
No.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:48.301
Like, it's a competition,
but both sides end up happy.

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.066
Like a win-win.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.305
More science-y than that.

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.347
If you want science, call your father.

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.311
Thank you.

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.345
Sorry.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.141
It's okay. I'm up.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.744
What time is it?

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.149
It's time you open that bottle
you've been hiding.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.021
You cracked something, didn't you?

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.306
Yeah, come here.

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.871
Take a look at this section.

01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:51.388
It seems to be talking about time.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.862
Their symbol for "time" is everywhere.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.590
So, what is this?

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.589
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.025
Who can tell?

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.430
There are too many gaps.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.706
Nothing's complete.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:07.465
Then it dawned on me.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.871
Come here.

01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.861
Right here.

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:16.104
Stop focusing on the ones,
look at the zeroes.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.389
How much of this is data?
How much of it is negative space?

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.629
So, I measured it.

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.064
0.0833 recurring.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.987
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:40.063
One of 12.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:46.150
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.429
We are part of a larger whole.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.264
Or we're one of 12 contestants
for the prize.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.501
Why do I have to talk to him?

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.230
We're all working together here.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.984
We need to talk to the other sites.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.730
We need to help them with what they've
gotten from the other heptapods.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.540
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.470
China just threatened to destroy
their shell. We're on our own.

01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.410
Yeah, but this says that
all of the pieces fit together.

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.866
And I'm telling you that
no one else cares.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.349
Two hours ago, we pulled this audio
off a secure channel in Russia.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.390
Someone on the science team there
was broadcasting wide.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:20.023
<i>In their final session, the alien said,
"There is no time.</i>"

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.341
<i>"Many become one."</i>

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.110
<i>I feel we have all been given weapons.</i>

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:27.949
<i>If anyone is receiving this, please...</i>

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.388
Well, I mean,

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.470
there are a lot of ways
you can interpret what he's saying.

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.580
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.622
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.031
to keep their secrets.

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.626
"Many become one" could
just be their way of saying,

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.390
"Some assembly required".

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.462
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.065
Why not just give it all over?

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:55.500
Well, what better way to force us
to work together for once?

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.504
Even if I did believe you,

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.100
how in the world you gonna get
anybody else to play along

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.591
or give up their data?

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.708
We offer ours in return.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.467
Yeah?

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.065
What, trade?

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:09.505
It's a non-zero sum game.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.665
"Non-zero sum game."

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.060
That's it.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:18.909
Yeah, thanks.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.741
Nine of the landing sites
have gone total comms blackout.

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.340
Only way to reach them
is to physically drive there and yell

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.130
at the border guards, which we're doing,
but it won't be fast enough.

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:37.666
There's got to be a way to...
To get the message to them.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.664
To our allies maybe, but at this stage,
it's too little too late.

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.584
<i>What we need is to get
all the other nations online</i>

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:45.389
<i>before one starts global war,</i>

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.548
<i>and there's no way for us to reach them.</i>

01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.110
Wait. Hold on a second.

01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.420
There is.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.029
<i>It's right above us.</i>

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.469
<i>That's problematic for us right now.</i>

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:58.790
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:02.069
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:03.870
Look, they're not our enemy.

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.700
They've made
no act of aggression towards us.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.708
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.703
That's not the question.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.862
Well, what is the question?

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.469
How do we get you back in that room
when it's half a mile straight up?

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.110
I think our work here is done.

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.546
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.948
What the hell is she doing?

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.746
No. God. Oh, God. No.

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.860
Costello?

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.430
Where's Abbott?

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:36.391
I'm sorry.

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.824
We're sorry.

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.344
I need you to...

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.943
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.740
I don't...

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.865
I don't understand.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:17.629
What is your purpose here?

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.862
How can you know the future?

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.071
I don't...

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:07.905
I don't understand.

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:11.022
Who is this child?

01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.182
The show is called
<i>Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals.</i>

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.780
Wait.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.950
No... wait.
Wait!

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.660
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.424
Are you all right?

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.260
- Hey. You all right?
- Yeah.

01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:55.370
- Here, come on.
- I'm fine.

01:32:55.372 --> 01:32:56.092
What happened?

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.864
Tried to figure it out. This is too big.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.750
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:04.620
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan are following China.

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.182
Ian. I don't understand why the...

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.500
<i>Help me, Mama.</i>

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.940
<i>Louise?</i>

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.260
Oh, my God.

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:14.705
Mom.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.065
Mama!

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.625
Sorry, honey.

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.461
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.780
Sunday.

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:37.986
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.344
Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:44.900
You're gonna see him this weekend.

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.465
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:58.584
That's my fault.

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:03.750
I told him something
that he wasn't ready to hear.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.106
What?

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:13.667
Well, believe it or not,

01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:16.425
I know something
that's going to happen.

01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:21.265
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:25.784
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.545
And he said I made the wrong choice.

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:35.307
What? What's going to happen?

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:42.141
It has to do with a really rare disease.

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.303
And it's unstoppable.

01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:51.463
Kind of like you are.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.428
Your swimming, and your poetry,

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.788
and all the other amazing things
that you share with the world.

01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.189
I am unstoppable?

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:03.306
Yeah.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.505
I got you.

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:24.785
Louise?

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:26.945
Louise.

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.906
I just realized why my husband left me.

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.545
My husband left me.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.429
You were married?

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.741
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.626
Mama?

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.861
Yeah?

01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.508
Why is my name Hannah?

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:18.671
Yeah, got it right here.

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:20.583
Get those people back, please.

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:26.671
Well, your name is very special
because it is a palindrome.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.028
It reads the same
forward and backward.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.940
- All right, guys, give me a hand here.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:36.021
That goes in the back.

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:52.231
<i>Civilian contractors must have their
authorization badges</i>

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.790
<i>and passkeys when checking...</i>

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.426
<i>Evacuation underway...</i>

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.026
<i>Hey.</i>

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.828
Look, we're done here.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.061
We're taking this with us.

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:38.670
I can read it.

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.629
- I know what it is.
- What?

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.782
It's not a weapon, it's a gift.

01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.344
The weapon is their language.

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:51.701
They gave it all to us.
Do you understand what that means?

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.585
So we can learn Heptapod,
if we survive.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.550
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.782
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.751
So you can see what's to come.

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.982
But time, it isn't the same for them.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.340
- It's non-linear.
- Look.

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.947
We did our best, but it wasn't enough.

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:12.864
The captain will load you up.

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.385
You're lifting off in five minutes.

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:18.507
Ian, Louise,
it was an honor to work with ya.

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.025
Good luck.

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.705
Hey, Colonel!

01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.390
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.901
Wake up, Mommy.

01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.910
Dr. Banks.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.465
A pleasure.

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:26.186
General Shang.

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.830
The pleasure is mine, really.

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:30.828
Your President said

01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:34.188
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.260
- Yes.
- But I confess,

01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.751
the only reason why I'm here is to

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.228
meet you in person.

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.541
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.987
Now, 18 months ago,

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.108
you did something remarkable.

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:56.227
Something not even my superior
has done.

01:39:58.100 --> 01:39:59.704
And what's that?

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:01.703
You changed my mind.

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:07.586
You're the reason for this unification.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:12.260
All because you reached out to me
on my private number.

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.341
Your private number.

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.946
General, I don't know
your private number.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.984
Now you know.

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:31.626
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.907
but I believe it was important for you
to see that.

01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.865
I called you, didn't I?

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:43.507
Yes, you did.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:55.826
Louise.

01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:14.860
- All right, let's shut down the system.
- Sir.

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:18.621
There's a sat-line here dialing China.

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:22.345
Here? What do you mean "here"?

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.305
Come on, come on.

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.145
Whose phone is it?

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:34.461
It's your phone, sir.

01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:43.426
Search base camp now.

01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.703
Find out who's using that phone.

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.700
- Hold on to those coordinates.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.306
Come on. What'd I say?

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:55.349
What'd I say? Come on.

01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:05.911
Come on.

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.831
I will never forget what you said.

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.509
You told me my wife's dying words.

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.710
Found the source of the phone call.

01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.748
It's in the clean room.
Waiting for instructions.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.389
What are you doing?

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.940
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.970
Can you buy me 20 seconds?
We don't have time for this right now.

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:56.028
No, trust me, buy me 20 seconds.
Do you trust me?

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.550
- Okay! Yeah.
- You trust me?

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:01.941
Dr. Banks!

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.430
Drop the phone now or we shoot!

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.150
- Drop it!
- Yeah. I'm sorry!

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.509
You're committing an act of treason!

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:21.620
- Yes.
- Drop it!

01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:23.310
It's done. I'm done.

01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:42.910
<i>Communications blackout from all 12
landing sites continues this evening.</i>

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.709
<i>Hold on, we are just hearing...</i>

01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:46.781
<i>And I'm being told</i>

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.545
<i>we're going to cut this report

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:52.305
<i>Breaking now, China has called

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.589
<i>General Shang, Commander-in-chief
of the People's Liberation Army,</i>

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.901
<i>has announced in
an emergency press conference</i>

<i>that China is standing down.</i>

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:02.750
<i>China is stating that
all intelligence they have received</i>

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:05.300
<i>will be shared immediately
with all the other landing sites.</i>

01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.930
<i>Scientists from around the world

- <i>from the UK, Japan...

<i>the Russian armed forces are now

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.941

<i>One of the 12 pieces of this puzzle
that's being slowly put together.</i>

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.905
So, Hannah.

01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.785
<i>This is where your story begins.</i>

01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:18.829
<i>The day they departed.</i>

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.390
You all right?

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:31.830
<i>Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,</i>

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.864
<i>I embrace it,</i>

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.702
<i>and I welcome every moment of it.</i>

01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:01.868
H-A-N-N-A-H.
H-A-N-N-A-H.

01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:20.985
Now backward. H-A-N-N-A-H.
H-A-N-N-A-H.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.550
Hannah.

01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:24.190
You ready, baby?

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.420
Okay.

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:28.380
Hi.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:33.140
- You good?
- All right. See ya.

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.231
Daddy!

01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.666
You okay?

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.151
<i>Daddy's gonna roll over you.</i>

01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:52.824
All right, you ready?

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:58.511
Guess what? Star stuff.

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:03.420
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:07.503
If you could see your whole life
from the start to finish,

01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:12.067
would you change things?

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:21.706
Maybe I'd say what I feel more often.

01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:23.225
I... I don't know.

01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.423
You know, I've had my head tilted up to
the stars for as long as I can remember.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:48.100
You know what surprised me the most?

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.260
It wasn't meeting them.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.744
It was meeting you.

01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:42.662
I forgot how good it felt
to be held by you.

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:53.983
You wanna make a baby?

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.740
Yes.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.140
Yeah.
