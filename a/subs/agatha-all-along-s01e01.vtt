01:11.666 --> 01:13.083
Another beautiful day.

01:15.666 --> 01:16.666
Hey, neighbor.

01:17.833 --> 01:19.583
Surprised to see you out here, Detective.

01:20.958 --> 01:25.041
There I was, sitting on my duff,
playing <i>Candy Crush,</i> happy as a clam,

01:25.041 --> 01:28.291
enjoying the fruits
of my undeserved disciplinary action...

01:28.291 --> 01:29.583
You punched a suspect.

01:29.583 --> 01:32.916
Oh, now a convicted felon.
I can't be right and wrong

01:32.916 --> 01:34.375
- at the same time.
- Yes, you can.

01:34.375 --> 01:37.166
When the Chief calls and tells me,
"Hibernation's over.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.375
So?

01:46.291 --> 01:48.791
[Herb] Jane Doe.
Found her down here by the water.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.583
Dispatch was tipped off
by an anonymous call.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.708
[Agnes] Mmm. Somebody
didn't want her out here alone.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.416
This is all she had on her.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.875
What's this? From a library book?

01:58.875 --> 02:00.041
Westview branch.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.750
[Agnes] Mmm-hmm.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.583
- Cause?
- Blunt force trauma.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.583
Not much of a drop around here. She fall?

02:06.583 --> 02:08.416
- She was crushed.
- By what?

02:08.416 --> 02:10.333
Something big. And heavy.

02:11.041 --> 02:12.500
So she didn't die here.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.250
She is dead, though, isn't she, Herb?

02:15.458 --> 02:17.583
Oh, she's really, most sincerely dead.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.166
You never know.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.541
[camera shutter clicking]

02:45.875 --> 02:47.208
Get samples from both.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.625
[Herb] Find something?

03:30.666 --> 03:31.875
Nah.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.750
They're set to roll her. You ready to see?

03:34.833 --> 03:35.833
Let's go.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.083
Who are you?

04:05.791 --> 04:07.041
What happened to you?

04:11.708 --> 04:12.750
[Herb] You okay, Agnes?

04:18.250 --> 04:19.250
How do you mean?

04:20.875 --> 04:22.458
You don't seem like yourself.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.583
Oh, yeah?

04:25.708 --> 04:27.166
And who is that exactly?

04:30.083 --> 04:32.250
I'll try to be more cheerful
for you next time, Herb.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.833
But right now this unidentified woman
lying dead in a creek

04:35.833 --> 04:37.625
has just got me down in the dumps.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.041
Let me know
when the dental records come in.

Ooh. Who's the victim? Is she dead?

Now, why do you assume it's a woman?

05:50.541 --> 05:54.000

- Huh, what?

06:26.958 --> 06:29.958
This book wasn't checked out.
It was stolen. Three years ago.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.000
But we have plenty more copies

- Oh.

You wanna take control
of my investigation.

No.

09:43.083 --> 09:47.541
If you wanna be in control, you can be.

09:51.375 --> 09:54.458
The body was moved across state lines.
Is that your play?

09:56.958 --> 09:58.541
Is this really how you see yourself?

10:01.625 --> 10:03.791
Sure. Let's talk about the case.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.250
What are your theories?
How'd she end up in the ravine?

10:07.833 --> 10:09.750
No drag marks.
Thinking the perp carried her.

10:10.458 --> 10:16.583
Uh... Seems logical. But you don't really
believe that because... Oops.

it's that these cases are always
about the place.

10:37.583 --> 10:41.750
the history of it, the people in it,
the secrets buried beneath it.

That's where the answers lie.

Well, who better to solve the mystery
than one of Westview's very own?

all right. And it's a beaut.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.375
Where'd you get it?

11:38.375 --> 11:41.208
Mind your beeswax, Norm.
Where's it from? How old is it?

11:41.958 --> 11:44.083
North American. New England, maybe.

where to start the bidding on eBay.

Did you know that
it is a universally-acknowledged truth

14:55.333 --> 14:57.208
that a lady cop cannot be good at her job

14:57.208 --> 14:59.375
and have a healthy personal life
at the same time?

Hungry?

15:03.875 --> 15:07.125
- [fridge door opens and closes]
- [sighs] So she's a rookie, granted,

15:07.125 --> 15:09.541
but I say to her,

15:09.541 --> 15:12.958
"Has the suspect been seen
in the last 24 hours?"

15:12.958 --> 15:15.833
And she says, "Only on TikTok."

15:16.458 --> 15:18.833
And then I say,
"Well, did you learn anything?"

15:18.833 --> 15:19.916
And she says,

15:21.375 --> 15:24.166
"That I was totally using
the wrong foundation brush."

[sighs and chuckles]

15:34.708 --> 15:35.708
Anyway...

15:41.291 --> 15:42.791
I have a lead in the case.

15:43.541 --> 15:45.125
That's not why I came over.

15:48.666 --> 15:49.666
But go ahead.

15:52.458 --> 15:56.208
There was a car wreck,
about an hour before time of death.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.333
- Where?
- Eastview.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Eastview?

16:01.583 --> 16:04.250
See, I thought you turned into a pumpkin
that far afield.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.750
Hey, I travel. I'm worldly.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.916
[chuckles] Where have you traveled?

16:15.833 --> 16:17.291
Okay, so what about the car wreck?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.625
Bloodstain in the back seat.

16:23.666 --> 16:25.208
You think that's how they moved her?

16:26.041 --> 16:27.708

16:28.291 --> 16:30.416
- Maybe two perps?
- Maybe.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.791
- [sighs]
- But you don't like it.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.791
My gut tells me they're related,

16:36.833 --> 16:39.208
but I can't shake this feeling
I'm seeing it wrong.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.333
Can I ask you something?

16:49.625 --> 16:50.625
Yeah.

Do you remember why you hate me?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.166
No.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.375
Are you hiding evidence?

17:06.041 --> 17:07.041
No.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.250
Well, you're only lying to yourself.

Hey! What are you doing?

17:35.625 --> 17:37.166
What did you take?

17:38.833 --> 17:39.958
You gotta be kidding me.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.708
Don't move! Freeze! Here we go.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.000
[grunts] Whoa!

17:49.541 --> 17:50.875
Crap, crap, crap.

17:51.791 --> 17:53.125
Hey! Where are you...

17:58.250 --> 17:59.791
Stop! Police!

17:59.791 --> 18:01.416
Don't you run from me!

Oh, my God. He came out of nowhere.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.333
Ma'am, get back in your vehicle!

18:41.541 --> 18:42.708

18:43.250 --> 18:47.000
Good. 'Cause I'm arresting you now.
And I want you real alert for that.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.125
All right, come on.

18:50.791 --> 18:53.375
Well, he won't give his name
and he's not in the system.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.333
First offense.
He take anything from your place?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.833
No, but not for lack of trying.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.875
I think it's time
for a good old-fashioned chat

19:01.875 --> 19:03.416
with Edward Scissorhands in there.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.291
Go get your perp.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.416
So I'm curious.

19:22.583 --> 19:26.083
What compelled you to break into
the home of a decorated detective?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.750
When you say "decorated,"
do you mean suspended without pay?

19:32.833 --> 19:34.458
Yeah, I know who you are.

19:37.666 --> 19:39.708
Let's talk about you, then,
you little dirtbag.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.416
Is B&E your regular gig?

19:45.583 --> 19:46.791
Hmm?

19:49.250 --> 19:50.625
'Cause you're crap at it.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.416
What were you looking for in my house?

19:55.791 --> 19:58.375
The respect of your peers
and a fulfilling home life.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.708
But you were fresh out of both.

20:00.708 --> 20:01.791
[grunts]

20:12.500 --> 20:13.500
See...

20:15.750 --> 20:18.208
The things that you're roasting me for

20:18.791 --> 20:20.916
are the things that make me dangerous.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.291
So you wanna keep poking the bear?

20:30.583 --> 20:31.583
Good.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.125
Now...

20:43.125 --> 20:44.208
What were you after?

20:47.333 --> 20:48.333
The Road.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.541
What road?

20:51.916 --> 20:53.625
You, of all people, should know.

21:02.666 --> 21:05.666
What? It's ink from the fingerprinting.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.750
I was on a road this morning.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.791
It led to something pretty awful.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.375
New question.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.250
Where were you last night
between the hours of 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.?

21:25.250 --> 21:27.833
Asleep. In bed.

21:39.416 --> 21:43.416
"Asleep in bed."

21:43.416 --> 21:46.708
[yelling] Total loser?

21:47.833 --> 21:51.875
Or totally lying?

21:51.875 --> 21:54.875
Let's find out.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.791
- What do you know about this?
- Nothing. Nothing!

21:59.791 --> 22:01.333
- Tell me who she is.
- I don't know.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.750
Tell me what happened to her!

22:02.750 --> 22:05.208
What are you talking about?
These are just flowers!

22:06.083 --> 22:07.083
What?

22:09.666 --> 22:12.458
They're just pictures
of someone's front yard or something!

22:19.875 --> 22:21.625
Why do you keep looking at that painting?

22:22.708 --> 22:23.708
It's not a...

22:26.083 --> 22:28.083
[chanting in Latin]

22:32.208 --> 22:34.208
- [in English] What are you saying?
- [continues chanting]

22:36.208 --> 22:37.208
What is that?

22:39.833 --> 22:40.833
Stop it.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.875
Get up! Get up!

22:44.500 --> 22:46.958
You know what?
You're spending the night in the tank.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.750
Let's see how long you can keep that up.

22:58.958 --> 23:00.083
There was a body.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.375
I saw the body.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.291
I'm not crazy.

23:06.916 --> 23:08.541
She was there. She was there.

23:42.291 --> 23:46.708
She was in her late 20s, green eyes, 5'7".

23:54.708 --> 23:56.625
Hair the color of...

24:00.333 --> 24:01.416
Scarlet.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.666

24:35.416 --> 24:36.875
How did she die?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.500
[scoffs] Wrong question.

24:40.541 --> 24:42.916
That witch is gone.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.500
And all of the copies of the Darkhold
with her.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.458
Leaving you trapped
in her distorted spell.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.458
But you don't have to stay there, do you?

24:52.458 --> 24:55.000

24:56.875 --> 25:00.125

25:00.791 --> 25:02.625
Yes. Claw your way out.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.791
I'm hot. Is it hot?

25:07.666 --> 25:08.833
I'm feeling...

25:12.208 --> 25:13.333
Good.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.791
What?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.083
[scoffs]

25:53.333 --> 25:55.750
There are two Jane Does in this case,

25:57.916 --> 25:59.541
and you know her name.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.875
So, what's yours?

27:03.458 --> 27:05.666
What? What is going on?

27:06.875 --> 27:08.083
Hey, Miss Agnes.

27:08.083 --> 27:10.000
- You feeling okay today?
- Stop talking.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.166
How long have I been here?

27:11.166 --> 27:13.500
Uh... What?

27:13.500 --> 27:18.166
How long have I been living
in this cesspool of a town?

27:18.166 --> 27:19.583
You don't remember?

27:21.666 --> 27:22.833
Catch me up.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.458
About three years.

27:25.708 --> 27:27.958
Three years?

27:30.916 --> 27:31.916
Wanda.

27:32.416 --> 27:33.875
- We try not to say her name.
- Ugh!

27:34.541 --> 27:37.833
Because you're cowards,
because you're sheep.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.708
What have I been doing all this time?

27:39.708 --> 27:43.458
Well, you've mostly been a good neighbor.
A bit too casual with your boundaries...

Call me "nosy," I'll cut out your tongue.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.875
Yeah.

You haven't been yourself

Almost like you got bit

27:52.500 --> 27:53.500

27:54.041 --> 27:58.791

- Just do something!

28:09.000 --> 28:10.708
- [Agatha] Oh, I get it.
- Just get her inside.

28:10.708 --> 28:13.500

28:24.583 --> 28:25.916
You know, um...

28:27.041 --> 28:29.458
Okay. Besides the fact that you're, um...

28:30.541 --> 28:33.291
You seem pretty lucid for a change.

28:33.291 --> 28:35.833
Aggressive, even. Powerful.

28:38.166 --> 28:39.166
What did you say?

28:39.666 --> 28:42.833
I said, "Powerful," but look, Agnes, if...

28:42.833 --> 28:44.500
It's Agatha.

28:45.833 --> 28:47.875
Okay. Agatha. Yeah.

Can you put on some clothes?

'Cause you... 'Cause you're naked.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.125
So that arrest was maybe
more of a kidnapping.

But if you're real
and not a figment of my imprisoned mind,

31:16.916 --> 31:18.750
How long has it been, Agatha?

31:18.750 --> 31:21.625
- Not sure.
- Since you acquired the Darkhold,

31:22.583 --> 31:24.625
you hid behind all that dark magic,

31:25.333 --> 31:26.750
but then you lost it.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.500
And now...

31:36.083 --> 31:37.166
You're vulnerable.

Only physically.

Do you remember pain?

Coochie coochie coo.

32:20.875 --> 32:25.208
You can't kill me. It's not allowed.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.541
Maybe I can't kill you,

32:39.083 --> 32:41.000
but I can make you wish you were dead.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.833
[groans] Wait, wait, wait.

32:45.291 --> 32:46.833

32:59.375 --> 33:01.291
Don't you want me at my best?

33:04.416 --> 33:07.375
Admit it. You prefer me...

Horizontal, in a grave.

33:11.583 --> 33:12.708
Formidable.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.666
So take my power.

33:15.833 --> 33:18.666
That's cute.
But you know that would kill me.

There are no new options?
