<i> You gotta save shaggy...</i>

18:55.636 --> 18:58.170
Or we're all
gonna die!

19:00.975 --> 19:03.642
Steve,
we have to save shaggy.

19:03.644 --> 19:04.643
Good luck.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.110
Two guys nabbed him

19:06.112 --> 19:07.646
And barricaded themselves
in his dressing room.

19:07.648 --> 19:11.049
If only there was some kind
of blueprint for this building.

19:11.051 --> 19:13.718
The schematics!
The schematics!

19:13.720 --> 19:18.123
Shaggy, you son of a bitch.
You slept with my wife!

19:18.125 --> 19:19.858
You destroyed
my family!

19:19.860 --> 19:21.794
It wasn't me.

[ light music plays ]
admit it!

19:23.397 --> 19:25.530
He said he caught you
on the counter!

19:25.532 --> 19:26.865
It wasn't me.

[ bluegrass music plays ]
liar!

19:30.404 --> 19:33.071
I saw you banging
on the sofa!

19:33.073 --> 19:37.076
[ dramatic music plays ]
it wasn't me-e-e-e!

19:39.480 --> 19:42.881
Lewises!
Why are you doing this?

19:42.883 --> 19:44.082
Picture this --

19:44.084 --> 19:45.417
He and my wife are both
butt-naked,

19:45.419 --> 19:46.885
Banging on
the bathroom floor!

19:46.887 --> 19:48.620
And I'm owed my revenge!

[ machinery whirring ]

[ grunts ]

19:51.625 --> 19:53.358
You both have issues.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.428
But you also have each other,
like brothers.

19:56.430 --> 19:57.696
Don't focus
on what you've lost.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.964
Think about the time
you're still lucky enough

19:59.966 --> 20:00.899
To have together.

20:00.901 --> 20:03.902
But I'm owed my revenge!

20:03.904 --> 20:06.104
Nah, bro.
She's right.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.906
As long as you and I
are together,

20:07.908 --> 20:09.374
We don't need
anything else.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.376
We can be a new family.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.711
Yeah.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.312
Yeah!
Yeah!

20:14.314 --> 20:16.048
Yeah!

20:18.252 --> 20:20.052
I love you, little bro.

20:20.054 --> 20:22.588
I love you too, hayley.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.425
I'm never playing this town
again.

It<i> was</i> me.

20:38.138 --> 20:40.205
It has always been me.

20:40.207 --> 20:42.541
And it shall forever be me.

20:42.543 --> 20:47.679
For I am mr. Boombastic,
creator of worlds,

20:47.681 --> 20:52.350
Master of the multiverse,
the one true god.

20:52.352 --> 20:58.823
And all you shorties
are my angels.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.592
Bye-bye!
See you soon.
