02:32.419 --> 02:34.419
The temperature okay back there?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.418
Is it, uh, too cold
or too hot or...

02:36.554 --> 02:37.958
Temperature's fine.

02:38.093 --> 02:39.526

Yes, sir.

03:30.147 --> 03:31.647
Eye in the sky.

03:31.783 --> 03:32.609
In position.

03:32.744 --> 03:35.111
They tell you
whose house this is?

03:35.247 --> 03:36.653
Mm-mm.

03:36.789 --> 03:38.181
Yeah. Me, neither.

04:32.174 --> 04:34.575
Hmm, let's go.

04:41.085 --> 04:43.452
- How do I look?
- Hmm.

04:46.056 --> 04:47.689
Oh, fuck.

04:49.259 --> 04:52.895

Tiny Dancer is arriving.

06:19.811 --> 06:22.011
Hey. No one said it was a kid.

06:22.147 --> 06:24.019

07:03.895 --> 07:05.187
Yeah.

07:07.096 --> 07:08.630
I had fun.

08:16.695 --> 08:18.027
Could be the father.

08:18.163 --> 08:20.563
Fuck. That's not
part of the plan.

08:20.699 --> 08:23.001
Shit.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.617
Ten seconds
till they at the door.

08:40.753 --> 08:41.819
Should I take the shot?

08:41.954 --> 08:43.390
-Negative.

08:43.525 --> 08:44.786
We'll be out in nine.

08:44.921 --> 08:46.255
Good luck.

08:49.628 --> 08:52.129
Abigail?

08:53.598 --> 08:55.671
Abigail!

08:59.874 --> 09:01.243
Need a new pickup. Back gate.

09:01.379 --> 09:04.046
- On it.

09:07.411 --> 09:09.351
All right.
I think we're in the clear.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.620
Oh, fuck!

09:12.756 --> 09:15.790
- Open the gate, assholes.

09:34.376 --> 09:35.708
All right, kids.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.072
We're not out of the woods yet.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.715
We still got to get
out of the city.

09:46.057 --> 09:47.822
She okay?

09:48.987 --> 09:52.629
Yep, she's good. Blindfold?

10:00.900 --> 10:04.168

10:10.010 --> 10:12.979

10:14.415 --> 10:15.885
Thank you.

10:16.821 --> 10:20.019
You grab me like that again,
I may have to respond.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.155
Understood.

10:23.058 --> 10:25.023
Okay, there's cameras
at this intersection.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.664

before the light.

10:32.668 --> 10:35.232

- Yep.

10:41.711 --> 10:44.274
-Not bad.
- I know, right?

Hey. No names.

What's up, boss?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.380
You made good time.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.050
Mm.

12:34.519 --> 12:36.823
-Whose house is this?

12:36.959 --> 12:39.195
This place is pretty sweet.

12:39.330 --> 12:40.992
You like this?

12:41.127 --> 12:42.999
Yeah, look at
all this cool shit.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.029
Hmm.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.633
Find a room
and get the girl situated.

12:46.768 --> 12:48.601
Set up a lookout position.

12:48.737 --> 12:50.840
Meet back here in five.

12:52.978 --> 12:57.008
For those of you who
don't know, I go by Lambert.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.708
<i>You all came
highly recommended.</i>

12:58.843 --> 13:01.978
<i>And so far, those
recommendations
are paying off.</i>

13:02.114 --> 13:04.587
All right. Sweet dreams. Okay.

13:04.722 --> 13:06.015
<i>You know the rules.</i>

13:06.151 --> 13:09.152
No real names, no backstories,

13:09.288 --> 13:11.657
and keep the grab-ass
to a minimum.

13:11.793 --> 13:14.730
It's a 24-hour job,

13:14.866 --> 13:16.992
<i>and the hard part
is already over.</i>

13:17.127 --> 13:19.066
<i>Now you babysit.</i>

13:20.400 --> 13:22.735
But the only one
that sees the girl is this one.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.967
<i>So she only hears one voice.</i>

13:25.102 --> 13:26.573
<i>The rest of you...</i>

13:26.708 --> 13:28.139
<i>get comfortable.</i>

13:28.275 --> 13:31.108
- Questions?
- Yeah. Who's the girl?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.516
You don't need
to know her name.

13:33.651 --> 13:35.812
I don't care about her name.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.349
Whose kid is she?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.887
- The fuck's that matter to you?
- A very wealthy man

13:40.023 --> 13:42.524
who's about to be
$50 million poorer.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.225
Look, you're safe here.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.894
And to be completely certain
that you can't be tracked,

13:47.030 --> 13:48.926
I'm going to collect
your cell phones.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.394
Nobody's tracking me.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.594
We're not taking any chances.
Give 'em over.

13:53.668 --> 13:54.732
In the bag.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.433
Bullshit, man.

13:57.536 --> 14:01.108
One second. I just gotta
send this real quick.

14:02.610 --> 14:03.940
Just...

14:04.076 --> 14:06.344
Thank you. Just... Okay.

14:08.486 --> 14:10.315
Thank you.

14:19.425 --> 14:23.263
Keep the doors locked
and the girl isolated.

14:23.398 --> 14:26.902
Anything else I can do for you
before I leave you to it?

14:27.038 --> 14:30.200
Uh, how come
we can't use our real names?

14:30.335 --> 14:31.805
So if any of you fucks
get caught,

14:31.941 --> 14:32.968
you can't rat out the others.

14:33.103 --> 14:34.238
Yeah, dumbass.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.842
You asked the same question
in the van.

14:36.978 --> 14:38.246
You want names?

14:38.382 --> 14:40.114
Fine.

14:41.012 --> 14:42.683
Frank. Dean.

14:42.819 --> 14:44.817
- Sammy. Peter.
- Peter...

14:44.953 --> 14:46.450
- Joey and...
-Damn.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.858
The man got his finger
on the pulse of pop culture.

14:48.994 --> 14:50.853
And you're Don fucking Rickles.
You happy?

14:50.989 --> 14:52.090
Not really.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.261
Who the fuck
is Don Rickles, man?

14:54.396 --> 14:56.557
There's clean bedding
and lit fires in the rooms.

14:56.693 --> 14:58.830
Kitchen's fully stocked,
so is the bar.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.997
See you in 24 hours,

15:01.133 --> 15:04.270
my lovely pack of rats.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.469
Rats?

15:06.604 --> 15:09.472
Why'd he...
How come he called us rats?

15:09.608 --> 15:14.483
♪ Goodbye, good luck,
God bless you... ♪

15:15.887 --> 15:18.249
Man, this place is dope, right?

15:18.385 --> 15:20.117
No. No, it's not. Thank you.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.690
Come have a drink with us, Joey.

15:21.825 --> 15:24.458
Gotta go check on the kid soon.

15:24.594 --> 15:25.587
Maybe after.

15:27.095 --> 15:28.423
No party poopers allowed, anyway.

15:28.559 --> 15:31.562
Hey. Who do you guys
think that, uh,

15:31.697 --> 15:34.768
- this girl's father is?
- Hmm, some tech billionaire.

15:34.903 --> 15:37.334
Nah. Probably real estate.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.608
Nah, you don't get
a house like that

15:39.744 --> 15:41.410
without being into some shit.

15:41.546 --> 15:43.775
Weapons, drugs...

15:43.911 --> 15:45.949
human trafficking.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.442
What about you, Joey?

15:47.578 --> 15:49.783
- Who you think he is?

15:49.919 --> 15:53.187
America's dad. Tom Hanks.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.017
Ha, ha.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.021
Let me get
a piece of that candy.

15:59.156 --> 16:00.055
Get your own.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.197
Fuck you, too.

16:02.332 --> 16:06.429
You grew up with a bunch of
brothers and sisters, huh?

16:06.565 --> 16:08.568
I'm like a expert
at reading people.

16:08.704 --> 16:09.634
Oh, really?

16:09.770 --> 16:10.971
Mm-hmm.

16:11.106 --> 16:13.201
You like a nanny
or a babysitter,

16:13.337 --> 16:16.111
looking after that kid.

16:17.012 --> 16:19.178
Your man here is the bagman

16:19.313 --> 16:21.650
for that dude
who let us in the door.

16:21.785 --> 16:25.016
Lookout/private security.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.449
Explosives man in the back,

16:27.584 --> 16:31.055
and a little
teenage runaway hacker

16:31.191 --> 16:34.296
turned black hat for the feds.

16:34.431 --> 16:35.623
Wow.

16:35.759 --> 16:37.895
You might be
the least perceptive person

16:38.031 --> 16:39.032
I've ever met.

16:39.167 --> 16:41.165
How the fuck
would you know that?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.505
You literally got nothing right.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.173
About anyone.

16:46.208 --> 16:48.272
Pretty sure
she ran away from home.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.110
- Crisp $100 bill,

16:50.246 --> 16:53.513
you can tell me
one true thing about me.

16:53.649 --> 16:54.943
Pass.

16:55.079 --> 16:56.346
Mm-hmm.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.714
Told y'all she ain't know shit.

17:01.692 --> 17:03.085
You used to be a cop.

17:03.221 --> 17:05.255
No way.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.230
Did he arrest you or something?

17:07.365 --> 17:08.531
No.

17:08.666 --> 17:09.829
It's the stance.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.934
The walk. The shoes.

17:12.070 --> 17:14.130
Not to mention
the standard-issue Glock,

17:14.265 --> 17:15.830
the shoulder holster,

17:15.965 --> 17:18.133
and he used police hand signals
back at the house.

17:18.269 --> 17:21.609
Not a street cop.

17:21.744 --> 17:24.746
No. Too smart.

17:24.881 --> 17:26.511
You need to be in control.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.152
So I'm gonna say detective.

17:30.787 --> 17:32.781
Homicide or vice.

17:32.916 --> 17:36.288
And he tries to hide it,
but he's from Queens.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.194
Probably only been up here
a few years.

17:43.460 --> 17:45.829
Hey, uh, you do me, too?

17:45.964 --> 17:46.996
Huh?

17:47.132 --> 17:48.830
Right here.

17:51.469 --> 17:54.573
I almost feel bad taking this...

17:54.708 --> 17:56.912
'cause you've basically got
a fucking neon sign

17:57.047 --> 17:59.115
over your head
that reads "muscle."

17:59.914 --> 18:01.310
Quebec, right?

18:01.445 --> 18:04.015
You got bullied in school?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.680
Probably by Dad, too.

18:05.816 --> 18:07.689
So when you got bigger
than everyone else,

18:07.824 --> 18:09.350
you turned the tables.

18:09.485 --> 18:11.523
Made it into a career.

18:12.863 --> 18:14.595
How much will this get me?

18:14.731 --> 18:15.958
Wow. Really?

18:16.094 --> 18:17.397
A 20?

18:17.532 --> 18:20.034
That's cheap, considering
you come from money.

18:20.169 --> 18:21.366
- It's true.
-Which means

18:21.501 --> 18:23.202
you're only in this
for the kicks.

18:23.337 --> 18:25.039
You don't get your hands dirty.

18:25.174 --> 18:26.934
You use a keyboard
instead of a gun

18:27.070 --> 18:29.605
and tell yourself that makes
what you do not as bad.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.445
Good luck
when the illusion wears off.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.177
Very good.

18:38.754 --> 18:39.751
No cash.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.585
Mm.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.523
Then I'll just leave it
at "semper fi."

18:45.688 --> 18:48.659
And you're getting off easy.

18:50.661 --> 18:53.000
Hold on, now,
you forgot about me.

18:53.135 --> 18:54.296
You don't want me to do you.

18:54.432 --> 18:56.332
What you mean? This fun.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.834
You're not a professional.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.541
I'm the best motherfucking
wheelman in this town.

19:03.677 --> 19:05.311
I didn't say you weren't good.

19:05.446 --> 19:08.312
I said you're not
a professional.

19:08.447 --> 19:11.852
You've got... loose wiring.

19:11.987 --> 19:14.355
Probably a sociopath.

19:16.519 --> 19:18.821
And you are a junkie.

19:23.097 --> 19:24.426
Cop knows a junkie.

19:24.562 --> 19:28.534
Your little candy affectation.

19:29.674 --> 19:31.404
Long sleeves.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.506
Why you don't want
to have a drink with us.

19:33.642 --> 19:35.703
You in recovery or something?
How many days you got?

19:35.839 --> 19:37.941
- We gotta be worried about you?
- No.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.677
No?

19:40.677 --> 19:43.252
Don't ever fuck with me.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.651
I will know.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.885
I'm gonna go check on the girl.

19:52.526 --> 19:56.397
I knew it.
Junkies never share candy.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.241
What's happening?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.572
How are you feeling?

20:07.707 --> 20:11.412
Where am I? Who are you?

20:12.213 --> 20:13.377
I can't tell you that.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.082
- I want to go home.
- Me, too.

20:16.218 --> 20:17.819
But we can't just yet.

20:17.954 --> 20:19.053
Hopefully very soon.

20:19.188 --> 20:20.888
Can you take the blindfold off?

20:21.024 --> 20:23.391
It's really tight.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.177
Are the cuffs hurting you?

20:49.150 --> 20:51.716
My arms are sore.

20:54.023 --> 20:55.258
Sit up.

21:01.358 --> 21:03.365
Thanks.

21:10.305 --> 21:13.474
- Better?

21:16.444 --> 21:18.710
What's going on?

21:19.644 --> 21:20.776
We're keeping you here

21:20.911 --> 21:22.747
until your father gives us
some money.

21:25.486 --> 21:27.654
- Do you know who my father is?
- No.

21:27.789 --> 21:29.855
And we don't want to know,
so don't tell me.

21:29.991 --> 21:31.118
Can I...

21:31.254 --> 21:33.923
Are you hungry? I could
bring you something to eat.

21:34.998 --> 21:36.862
Are you gonna hurt me?

21:36.997 --> 21:38.528
No.

21:38.663 --> 21:41.667
If you behave and do as we say,

21:41.803 --> 21:44.306
and if your dad gives us money,
you'll be fine.

21:44.442 --> 21:47.369
In the meantime,
I'm here to keep you safe

21:47.504 --> 21:49.477
and comfortable.

21:50.112 --> 21:51.510
Can you promise me

21:51.646 --> 21:54.081
you're not gonna
let anybody hurt me?

21:54.217 --> 21:56.682
I'll do you one better.

21:58.252 --> 21:59.981
I pinkie-promise you

22:00.116 --> 22:03.392
that I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.060
What's your name?

22:13.698 --> 22:16.531
Um... Oh, you can call me Joey.

22:16.666 --> 22:19.540
Do you have any kids?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.078
I have a little boy.

22:26.213 --> 22:27.381
About your age.

22:27.517 --> 22:30.084
What's his name?
Mine's Abigail.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.113
I can't tell you his name.

22:32.249 --> 22:35.454
- Can I make one up?
- I'd rather you didn't.

22:35.589 --> 22:38.493
I'm just gonna call him Justin.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.464
What's Justin like?

22:43.296 --> 22:45.998
He's...

22:46.133 --> 22:47.703
just a...

22:47.839 --> 22:49.702
normal kid.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.501
What does he like?

22:52.636 --> 22:55.103
Just normal kid stuff.

22:56.975 --> 23:00.042
I don't really know
about kid stuff.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.417
My dad, well...

23:04.553 --> 23:08.023
he thought
he wanted a child, but...

23:08.159 --> 23:10.151
then he just lost interest.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.891
You've made a mistake.

23:15.463 --> 23:17.862
He doesn't care about me.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.133
I'm gonna leave you alone now.

23:26.307 --> 23:27.436
I'll be back soon.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.104
Really soon, okay?

23:30.441 --> 23:32.415
Okay.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.015
- Joey?
- Yeah?

23:41.153 --> 23:44.727
I'm sorry about
what's gonna happen to you.

23:49.432 --> 23:50.459
- Yeah, motherfucker!
-Oh!

23:50.594 --> 23:52.268
Drink, bitch!

23:52.403 --> 23:54.297
- I really don't want to.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.434
Oh, my God.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.767
- I like your tattoos.
- Mm-hmm.

23:57.902 --> 24:00.135
Do they have, uh,
a meaning or...

24:00.270 --> 24:01.940
We're not supposed
to get personal, big boy.

24:02.075 --> 24:03.939
Well, I know, but
I like your little demon guy.

24:04.075 --> 24:06.009
I just said it's too personal.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.584
Thank you. You don't even
know my name, man.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.755
- How's the kid?
- She's fine.

24:13.890 --> 24:16.752
Look, I don't need to know
who the girl's father is,

24:16.887 --> 24:19.658
- but do you know?
- No. Why?

24:19.794 --> 24:21.495
She just implied
that her father might be

24:21.631 --> 24:24.259
- a particularly violent man.
-  Wow.

24:24.995 --> 24:26.961
She implied that, did she?
Well...

24:27.097 --> 24:28.700
of course
she fucking implied that.

24:28.836 --> 24:30.902
She's scared.
She wants to rattle you.

24:31.603 --> 24:32.868
I don't think so.

24:33.004 --> 24:36.475
Again, do you know
who her father is?

24:36.610 --> 24:37.709
Oh, my God, you're gonna be

24:37.844 --> 24:39.543
a real pain in my ass,
aren't you?

24:39.679 --> 24:42.177
There's one in every crew.

24:43.921 --> 24:45.182
No, sir.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.755
I just don't scare easy,
so when I do, I pay attention.

24:51.493 --> 24:52.923
Yes! I like that one.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.229
You're just missing
so you have to finish

24:54.365 --> 24:55.496
the whole bottle, aren't you?

24:55.632 --> 24:56.694
I don't know why
you would say that.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.429
- Oh, that's bad.

24:58.564 --> 24:59.829
- Ha!
- I like you.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.269
- You're scary, though.
- Really?

25:01.404 --> 25:02.269
-Scary?
-Yeah.

25:02.404 --> 25:03.400
Why am I scary?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.166
- Ha!

25:05.301 --> 25:07.409
-You're funny.

25:07.544 --> 25:08.773
- Oh, that's bad.
-Your turn.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.946
I don't have a quarter, man.

25:15.350 --> 25:17.118
Oh, fuck!

25:17.253 --> 25:19.080
Fuck! Shit. Christ.

25:19.216 --> 25:20.851
Look away!
Don't fucking look at me!

25:20.987 --> 25:23.752
You see my face?
You see my fucking face?

25:23.887 --> 25:25.359
Huh? Are you lying to me?

25:25.495 --> 25:26.760
- No.
- You fucking lying to me?

25:26.895 --> 25:28.157
- No. I'm-I'm not!
- Don't lie to me.

25:28.292 --> 25:30.729
What color are my eyes?
What color are my eyes?!

25:30.865 --> 25:31.892
It's a simple
fucking question, kid!

25:32.028 --> 25:33.364
I didn't see your face!

25:33.499 --> 25:35.566
Well... good!

25:35.702 --> 25:38.201
Who the fuck is your father?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.035
Jo... Joey said
you didn't want to know.

25:41.170 --> 25:42.740
Well, fuck Joey!
I do want to know!

25:42.876 --> 25:44.640
- Who the fuck is your father?
- Okay.

25:44.775 --> 25:46.040
I'm-I'm sorry.

25:46.176 --> 25:49.050
- Who is your father?
- My father is...

25:51.187 --> 25:52.984
Kristof Lazaar.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.021
The fuck did you say?

25:57.992 --> 26:00.460
♪ Why don't
you hear me cryin'? ♪

26:00.596 --> 26:02.456
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪

26:03.259 --> 26:06.635
- ♪ A-whoo-hoo... ♪

26:07.471 --> 26:09.565
Yo, what's going on, bagman?

26:09.700 --> 26:10.998
I'm leaving.

26:11.133 --> 26:12.474
- What?
-You heard me.

26:12.609 --> 26:14.470
You cut up my share
however you want.

26:14.606 --> 26:15.776
I'm out.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.079
Whoa. Hey.

26:18.214 --> 26:19.544
What happened?

26:19.680 --> 26:21.076
Hey! You can't just leave

26:21.212 --> 26:22.984
without telling us
what's going on.

26:23.119 --> 26:25.819
What's going on? What's going
on is that we are fucked.

26:25.955 --> 26:28.951
That little girl is
Kristof Lazaar's daughter.

26:29.086 --> 26:31.554
- Shit.
- Who's Kristof Lazaar?

26:31.690 --> 26:32.791
Who's Lazaar?

26:32.926 --> 26:35.494
Bruh,
that's a urban legend, man.

26:35.629 --> 26:36.794
- Calm down.
- No, dude.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.598
He's not a fucking urban legend.

26:38.734 --> 26:40.801
He is very fucking real,
believe me.

26:40.936 --> 26:43.536
Nobody even knows how big
his fucking empire is.

26:43.671 --> 26:44.869
So he's, like, a crime boss?

26:45.004 --> 26:46.672
He controls a lot more
than just crime.

26:46.807 --> 26:48.543
Is Lambert fucking insane?

26:48.678 --> 26:50.375
He just put a death mark
on all of us.

26:50.511 --> 26:51.445
Including himself.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.977
What if we just, like,

26:53.112 --> 26:55.511
you know, like, give her back
and say sorry?

26:55.646 --> 26:56.949
Oh, yeah.

26:57.084 --> 26:58.546
"Here's your daughter,
Mr. fucking Antichrist.

26:58.681 --> 27:01.116
"We're really sorry.
Hope she's not too traumatized.

27:01.252 --> 27:03.190
Let's play a round of golf
sometime."

27:03.325 --> 27:04.284
Fuck you, Frank.

27:04.420 --> 27:07.355
This isn't the time
for sarcasm, okay?

27:10.399 --> 27:11.933
Let's just leave.

27:12.069 --> 27:14.401
We leave her with some food and
make an anonymous phone call,

27:14.536 --> 27:15.568
get the fuck out of Dodge.

27:15.704 --> 27:16.902
- I like that.

27:17.037 --> 27:18.099
It's not like
she's seen our faces.

27:18.235 --> 27:21.238
Uh, actually, she has,
thanks to you.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.106
I was supposed to be the only
one in and out of that room.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.681
- And I wore my mask.
- Well, I didn't,

27:26.816 --> 27:29.009
so I walk in there
to see Angelina Ballerina

27:29.145 --> 27:31.082
memorizing my fucking face.

27:32.487 --> 27:33.885
Major party foul.

27:34.021 --> 27:35.486
Why did you take off
her blindfold, Joey?

27:35.621 --> 27:36.587
It's messy.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.391
Now we have to kill her.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.658
Not a fucking chance.

27:39.793 --> 27:41.230
We're not killing the girl.

27:41.365 --> 27:42.795
She saw Frank's face.

27:42.931 --> 27:44.663
Even if Lazaar
catches up to him,

27:44.799 --> 27:46.093
he don't know shit about us.

27:46.228 --> 27:47.602
He knows that I'm Quebecois.

27:47.738 --> 27:49.397
Huh? He knows
that Sammy comes from money.

27:49.532 --> 27:51.700
He knows that you come
from a military background,

27:51.835 --> 27:53.204
thanks to Joey.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.836
Just had to do your little
magic trick, didn't you?

27:55.972 --> 27:57.312
Hold up.

27:57.447 --> 27:59.339
If we just leave her here,

27:59.475 --> 28:01.716
then we don't get
none of that money?

28:01.851 --> 28:05.420
Kind of need some money
real bad right now.

28:05.556 --> 28:06.915
I don't know about y'all.

28:07.051 --> 28:08.421
How much do you trust Lambert?

28:08.556 --> 28:11.254
I trust him enough.

28:11.389 --> 28:13.927
That doesn't make it
worth the risk, though.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.727
If seven million per person
isn't worth the risk,

28:18.862 --> 28:20.436
then what is?

28:20.571 --> 28:22.969
It's a lot of money.

28:26.669 --> 28:28.777
All right, he wouldn't have
had us kidnap the kid

28:28.912 --> 28:30.609
if he didn't think
we could pull this off,

28:30.745 --> 28:31.943
so maybe we all just pretend

28:32.079 --> 28:33.781
like we don't know
who her father is,

28:33.917 --> 28:35.582
and with the money
we're making from this,

28:35.717 --> 28:37.379
we just disappear forever. Hmm?

28:38.388 --> 28:39.447
<i>Start a new life.</i>

28:39.582 --> 28:42.587
I never have to see
any of you fucks ever again.

28:42.722 --> 28:45.155
Everyone stay alert.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.289
<i>Any threat is
gonna come from outside,</i>

28:47.425 --> 28:50.029
<i>so we set a perimeter
and we hold it.</i>

28:50.164 --> 28:52.499
Rickles takes first watch
in the crow's nest.

28:52.634 --> 28:54.435
Joey, secure the interior.

28:54.571 --> 28:56.464
<i>Look for any ways in or out.</i>

28:58.172 --> 29:03.141
<i>What is it, like,
22 more hours, hmm?</i>

29:04.643 --> 29:05.840
22 hours.

29:08.251 --> 29:09.211
Fuck.

29:09.347 --> 29:12.018
-What a dick.

31:24.822 --> 31:26.117
I thought I heard someone
out here.

31:26.252 --> 31:29.390
I'm not as stealthy
as I thought.

31:29.525 --> 31:31.520
Want to come in?

31:33.122 --> 31:34.763
I sort of have

31:34.899 --> 31:38.265
this reputation
of being a professional.

31:38.401 --> 31:39.260
So...

31:39.395 --> 31:41.970
And so you have to do your job.

31:43.605 --> 31:45.237
Hey, listen.

31:50.178 --> 31:53.080
I don't trust
any of these other fucks.

31:54.248 --> 31:57.085
So let's watch
each other's backs.

31:57.721 --> 32:00.351
I was thinking the same thing.

32:38.922 --> 32:41.562
<i>I'm that
hungry little kitty cat</i>

32:41.698 --> 32:43.430
<i>you just read about.</i>

32:45.663 --> 32:50.198
<i>I'm so hungry I could eat a...
a woodpecker.</i>

32:50.333 --> 32:52.370
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

32:53.006 --> 32:54.810
Oh, my God!

32:54.945 --> 32:56.678
- What the fuck?!
- No, it-it's me.

32:56.813 --> 32:57.978
It's Dean, it's Dean.

32:58.113 --> 33:00.241
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck, Dean?!

33:00.377 --> 33:01.816
Just was trying to prank you.

33:01.952 --> 33:02.945
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.013
You can have it.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.349
- Get out!
- Listen.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.254
I saw the way you was
looking at me earlier,

33:07.390 --> 33:10.691
and I thought we could just,
like, you know, vibe out or...

33:10.827 --> 33:12.059
- Get the fuck out!
- Hey.

33:12.195 --> 33:13.356
- I'm not looking at you, man.
- Whoa, whoa.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.192
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Get the fuck out!

33:15.327 --> 33:16.458
- Stupid motherfucker!

33:16.593 --> 33:18.093
- God!
- I didn't mean to scare you.

33:18.229 --> 33:19.661
I don't give a shit!

33:21.431 --> 33:24.072
- Are you sure?
- Fuck off!

33:25.103 --> 33:26.904
Get the fuck out!

33:27.039 --> 33:29.171
Go! Get the fuck out!

33:29.306 --> 33:31.645
- All right.
- Get out!

33:31.780 --> 33:33.214
Don't come back!

33:33.350 --> 33:34.946
-<i>Now,
my fine pigeon...
- </i>

33:35.082 --> 33:38.020
<i>I'm going to pick you dry.</i>

35:00.934 --> 35:03.798
What the fuck?

35:29.060 --> 35:31.232
Hello?

35:36.903 --> 35:39.273
Hello?

35:50.413 --> 35:52.781
Is someone down there?

36:07.564 --> 36:10.205
- What the fuck?!

36:12.837 --> 36:15.609
Scared the shit out of me,
little motherfuckers.

36:17.110 --> 36:19.077
Man, fuck this shit.

36:28.518 --> 36:31.824
Ow! Oh, shit!

36:31.959 --> 36:33.588
Help me! Help...

36:33.723 --> 36:35.324
<i>You're just in time for dinner.</i>

36:35.459 --> 36:36.592
<i>Yeah?</i>

36:36.727 --> 36:38.963
<i>What are you going to have
for dinner?</i>

36:39.098 --> 36:42.798
Help me! Help!

36:49.844 --> 36:51.708
Dean?

36:55.748 --> 36:58.550
Dean, you better not be
fucking with me again.

37:08.323 --> 37:10.298
Hey!

37:47.936 --> 37:50.965
Stupid.

37:55.471 --> 37:57.174
You little shit.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.908
Can't...

38:09.485 --> 38:10.657
Sammy?

38:16.361 --> 38:17.959
What? What happened?

38:18.761 --> 38:21.131
His head fell off.

38:21.267 --> 38:22.931
I don't know.

38:23.933 --> 38:26.666
Why do you have a dick
on your face?

38:26.802 --> 38:29.072
- What?
- Just go get them.

38:29.208 --> 38:30.605
Go get them!

38:30.740 --> 38:32.746
- Okay.

38:32.882 --> 38:34.814
Okay. Okay.

38:34.950 --> 38:36.780
Help! Help!

38:44.186 --> 38:46.623
What the fuck were you doing
down here, anyway?

38:46.759 --> 38:48.924
I couldn't sleep.
I heard something.

38:49.059 --> 38:52.300
What, you just had to come
and check it out, huh?

38:52.435 --> 38:55.503
You think I could do that?

38:56.406 --> 38:58.440
Be honest. What does that
look like to you?

38:58.575 --> 39:01.409
It looks like a fucking
wild animal ripped him apart.

39:02.838 --> 39:05.245
No. No. No. I'm not fu...

39:05.380 --> 39:06.978
We're not fucking going there.

39:07.113 --> 39:08.280
Oh, fuck.

39:08.415 --> 39:10.615
Why are you all acting so weird?

39:10.751 --> 39:14.155
There are stories
about Lazaar's hit man.

39:14.291 --> 39:16.651
- Can we not do this, please?
- Valdez.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.559
I heard a story once.

39:18.695 --> 39:21.358
Three of Lazaar's top guys
got pinched a few years ago.

39:21.493 --> 39:22.726
The FBI flipped 'em.

39:22.862 --> 39:24.559
Night before the trial,
they were all holed up

39:24.695 --> 39:26.027
on the top floor of a hotel.

39:26.163 --> 39:28.368
A dozen agents in the next room
and two on the door.

39:28.503 --> 39:31.271
Next morning,
FBI goes into the room.

39:31.406 --> 39:33.568
All they bodies
are ripped apart.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.906
Limbs... and organs missing.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.839
Decapitations.

39:39.975 --> 39:43.479
That's his signature. Valdez.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.782
He's a fucking animal.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.785
And there was no way
in and out of that room

39:47.921 --> 39:50.986
except for the front door
or the 23rd-story window.

39:52.161 --> 39:53.591
So how'd he do it?

39:53.727 --> 39:57.291
- Bullshit.
- It's not fucking bullshit.

39:58.260 --> 40:00.432
That's not the first time
I heard that story.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.635
We'd better check on the girl.

40:09.411 --> 40:11.245
All right, let's game this out.

40:11.381 --> 40:13.080
If Valdez
or anyone else is in here,

40:13.216 --> 40:15.984
that means Lambert gave us up.

40:16.119 --> 40:17.277
And I don't buy that.

40:17.412 --> 40:20.384
Or Lazaar got to him and
beat our location out of him.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.981
Are you fucking kidding me?

40:22.117 --> 40:23.552
Lambert is
a meticulous motherfucker.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.152
He's very, very careful.

40:25.288 --> 40:27.756
If he gave us up, that means
either one of us did it

40:27.891 --> 40:30.261
or Valdez is in here
and he did it.

40:30.397 --> 40:32.797
Or one of us is Valdez.

40:35.034 --> 40:38.671
I, for one, would like to
revisit the cut-and-run idea.

40:41.671 --> 40:43.507
Yeah, but...

40:43.642 --> 40:46.511
Wrinkles, now that Dean is dead,

40:46.646 --> 40:48.844
- we have a bigger share.

40:48.979 --> 40:50.584
You're welcome to my share,
Pete.

40:50.719 --> 40:52.346
You could be the richest
headless man in America.

40:52.482 --> 40:54.456
Okay.

40:55.323 --> 40:57.221
- He just died.
- Okay.

40:57.356 --> 40:59.527
So messed up.

41:00.756 --> 41:02.761
Hello?

41:04.693 --> 41:06.228
She's fine.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.002
Just because she's
still in there doesn't mean

41:08.138 --> 41:10.365
that Valdez is not here.

41:10.501 --> 41:12.334
I'm out.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.908
You coming?

41:17.145 --> 41:19.214
Suit yourself.

41:19.349 --> 41:21.978
- You're leaving?
- Bye-bye.

41:23.252 --> 41:24.677
Bye, Wrinkles.

41:24.813 --> 41:27.249
Come on.

41:27.385 --> 41:29.623
Rickles.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.856
Hey!

41:38.997 --> 41:42.196
Where the fuck
did that come from?

41:46.075 --> 41:47.267
What the fuck?

41:50.575 --> 41:52.242
Wrinkles.

41:52.378 --> 41:53.911
Stand back.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.928
It's locked.

42:07.063 --> 42:08.556
Thanks, Peter.

42:26.680 --> 42:30.616
Uh... what the fuck
is happening?

42:30.752 --> 42:32.618
I think that, uh,
trying the door,

42:32.754 --> 42:34.989
it, uh... it-it triggered it
or something.

42:35.124 --> 42:37.319
Fuck.

42:39.989 --> 42:42.025
This whole thing is a trap.

42:42.933 --> 42:43.760
Shit!

42:43.895 --> 42:45.398
Wrinkles! Where's...?

42:45.534 --> 42:46.963
Hey. Where's Wrinkles going?

42:47.099 --> 42:48.765
If this is Valdez,
maybe he checked on the girl

42:48.900 --> 42:50.403
and left her there
to throw us off.

42:50.539 --> 42:53.036
I'll see what I can find out.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.713
What the fuck?

43:04.915 --> 43:07.451
I need to ask you something.

43:07.586 --> 43:08.786
Has anyone besides me

43:08.922 --> 43:11.155
and the man with the glasses
been in here?

43:11.290 --> 43:12.686
No.

43:12.821 --> 43:14.794
No one at all?

43:15.558 --> 43:17.225
No.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.264
Hey.

43:22.368 --> 43:26.333
Can you pinkie-promise me that
you're not keeping a secret?

43:31.509 --> 43:32.806
Abigail.

43:32.942 --> 43:35.108
He's gonna hurt me.

43:35.243 --> 43:38.082
- Who?
- The man with the glasses.

43:38.217 --> 43:41.920
He told me I had to keep
a secret or he'd hurt me.

43:42.587 --> 43:44.186
What did he say?

43:45.791 --> 43:48.927
It's okay. You can tell me.

43:51.232 --> 43:52.431
Abigail.

43:52.567 --> 43:53.863
- Hey.

43:53.998 --> 43:56.163
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

43:56.298 --> 43:59.102
But I need you
to tell me what he said.

44:01.873 --> 44:04.343
He said he works for my father.

44:04.479 --> 44:07.244
He said his name was...

44:07.380 --> 44:09.346
Valdez.

44:11.586 --> 44:13.281
I need to talk to you right now.

44:13.983 --> 44:15.921
I'll be right outside.

44:20.892 --> 44:22.895
Someone stole my fucking rifle.

44:23.727 --> 44:24.958
Frank is Valdez.

44:25.094 --> 44:26.493
- What?
- He told the girl.

44:26.628 --> 44:28.469
Frank wanted to leave.
That doesn't make any sense.

44:28.604 --> 44:30.638
He acted
like he wanted to leave.

44:30.774 --> 44:32.602
If he's Valdez
and Lazaar's his boss,

44:32.738 --> 44:33.971
then why kidnap his kid?

44:34.107 --> 44:36.469
Maybe he and Lambert
are planning a power play.

44:36.605 --> 44:40.407
That skinny
motherfucker rips people apart?

44:42.144 --> 44:44.378
Something doesn't add up.

44:47.152 --> 44:50.623
Aside from Frank,
these guys are amateurs.

44:50.758 --> 44:52.990
- You're Army, right?
- Medic.

44:53.125 --> 44:56.390
- We can take 'em.
- We can take 'em.

44:56.525 --> 44:58.224
If it's Frank,
he'll know how to get out.

44:58.359 --> 44:59.894
Which means
so would I if I spend

45:00.030 --> 45:01.598
about six minutes with him.

45:01.734 --> 45:02.999
You take the other two.

45:03.135 --> 45:05.701
Take the main staircase
while I go south.

45:05.836 --> 45:07.368
We meet in the middle.

45:08.136 --> 45:10.011
We gonna get through this.

45:10.146 --> 45:11.343
I have to.

45:11.478 --> 45:13.341
You have a kid?

45:17.818 --> 45:19.919
We'll make sure you get home.

45:44.180 --> 45:45.643
Rickles?

46:27.282 --> 46:29.923
This is so fucking disgusting.

46:32.593 --> 46:34.360
God, what the fuck?

46:34.496 --> 46:36.325
Where's Frank?

46:45.136 --> 46:47.974
Don't point that at Sammy, Joey.

46:49.972 --> 46:50.973
Seen Frank?

46:51.109 --> 46:52.273
House this fancy, you'd think

46:52.409 --> 46:54.479
they could put fucking towels
in the...

46:54.614 --> 46:55.910
Oh. Hey, Joey.

46:56.045 --> 46:57.747
What's going on?

46:57.882 --> 46:59.579
Why'd you do it?

47:00.652 --> 47:01.554
Do what?

47:01.689 --> 47:03.319
Bring us here to kill us.

47:07.794 --> 47:09.656
Don't do it, Peter!

47:09.791 --> 47:11.766
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about,

47:11.901 --> 47:13.362
but you don't sound
very calm right now,

47:13.497 --> 47:16.464
Little Miss Paranoid,
so forgive the precaution.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.236
You guys know what the fuck
she's talking about?

47:18.371 --> 47:21.508
I think she thinks that
you brought us here to kill us.

47:21.644 --> 47:24.273
Wow. Fantastic insight, Peter.

47:24.409 --> 47:27.347
Care to share
what's on your mind, Joey?

47:27.483 --> 47:28.341
You're Valdez.

47:28.476 --> 47:31.045
You told the girl,
you killed Dean,

47:31.181 --> 47:33.013
and you just killed Rickles.

47:33.148 --> 47:34.581
Mr. Wrinkles is dead?

47:36.024 --> 47:37.825
- I didn't tell that girl shit.
- Bullshit.

47:37.960 --> 47:39.587
Wow. You got a lot
going on up there, junkie,

47:39.723 --> 47:41.961
but your brain's not quite
putting it together, huh?

47:42.096 --> 47:44.128
You let a little girl
get inside your head?

47:44.264 --> 47:46.097
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

47:46.233 --> 47:48.098
The girl, though,
she's fucking inspired,

47:48.234 --> 47:49.930
turning us
against each other like this.

47:50.065 --> 47:51.303
I believe her.

47:51.438 --> 47:52.937
Hmm.

47:53.073 --> 47:54.842
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think

47:54.977 --> 47:57.208
we're gonna have to get rough
with her.

48:00.777 --> 48:01.777
No.

48:01.912 --> 48:03.417
I'll do it.

48:04.646 --> 48:07.313
Don't take another
fucking step, Peter.

48:07.449 --> 48:09.782
It, uh... it's my job, Joey.

48:09.918 --> 48:11.825
Look, I just want to get to
the bottom of this, you know?

48:11.960 --> 48:13.960
My team is dropping
like flies, and...

48:14.095 --> 48:16.423
well, our guest
has besmirched my good name,

48:16.559 --> 48:19.901
and I take that
very personally, you know?

48:28.777 --> 48:30.841
Abigail?

48:30.976 --> 48:33.475
I'm very sorry, okay?

48:36.213 --> 48:37.815
Joey, what's happening?

48:37.951 --> 48:39.050
Just sorting something out.

48:39.185 --> 48:40.449
I'm just trying
to do my job, huh?

48:40.584 --> 48:42.252
Fucking put it down.
I'd really prefer not to

48:42.387 --> 48:44.417
- have to fucking shoot you.

48:44.552 --> 48:46.557
- What is he talking about?
- Get up.

48:48.497 --> 48:49.792
Frank,

48:49.927 --> 48:51.730
just shoot her.

48:51.866 --> 48:53.561
She's not gonna kill me.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.398
I might be wrong, Frank.

48:56.534 --> 48:58.171
- Joey, I'm scared.
- Fucking put it down.

48:58.306 --> 49:00.334
- I'm not fucking around here.
- You promised, Joey.

49:00.469 --> 49:01.908
I'm doing my best here, Abigail.

49:02.044 --> 49:03.173
Please point that
somewhere else.

49:03.309 --> 49:04.505
You're not touching that girl.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.275
-Okay.
-Put it the fuck down.

49:06.410 --> 49:07.782
Sammy,
little help would be nice.

49:07.917 --> 49:09.146
Don't pull Sammy into this.

49:09.281 --> 49:10.411
We need to know what she knows.

49:10.546 --> 49:12.352
Just let me
fucking talk to her.

49:12.488 --> 49:13.886
-No, no, no, no, no.
I'll talk to her.
-Peter.

49:14.022 --> 49:15.385
- Guys?
-You step the fuck back.

49:15.521 --> 49:18.323
Put it down, or you
can die right fucking now.

49:18.458 --> 49:19.888
-Guys, come on.
-Don't fucking try me!

49:20.024 --> 49:21.759
- Guys!
- Sammy!

49:21.895 --> 49:23.857
Sammy, shut the fuck up!

49:23.993 --> 49:25.993
What the fuck? How the fuck'd
she get out of those cuffs?

49:26.128 --> 49:27.364
Huh?

49:30.665 --> 49:33.038
- Holy fuck!
- Aah! Get her off of me!

49:33.173 --> 49:36.006
-Fuck!

49:39.509 --> 49:40.748
- Jesus fucking Christ.

49:40.883 --> 49:43.281
- Did-did she get me?
-Fuck.

49:43.948 --> 49:45.012
What the fuck?

49:49.389 --> 49:52.023
-Oh, fuck.
-Aah! No, no, no, no.

49:52.158 --> 49:54.589
- No fucking way!
- What the fuck?

50:13.179 --> 50:15.676
- What the fuck?

50:16.511 --> 50:18.547
What the fuck? What the fuck?

50:25.256 --> 50:26.353
We kidnapped a fucking vampire.

50:28.092 --> 50:29.493
A ballerina vampire.

50:29.628 --> 50:31.626
Someone has been messing
with us ever since we got here.

50:31.761 --> 50:34.268
Right? It's got to be, uh,
some kind of trick.

50:34.404 --> 50:36.065
I don't know anyone that could
pull off a trick like that.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.738
- Do you?
- I feel sick.

50:37.874 --> 50:39.368
At least Valdez isn't in here.

50:39.503 --> 50:41.874
The fucking girl is Valdez,
you moron.

50:42.009 --> 50:43.239
I thought her name was Abigail.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.045
She isn't... There isn't a...

50:45.181 --> 50:47.811
- Jesus fucking Christ.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.313
Shit.
We got to get out of here.

50:52.449 --> 50:53.546
There's got to be another way.

50:53.681 --> 50:55.221
No, I checked
all the other doors.

50:55.356 --> 50:56.616
These are some kind
of magnetically sealed locks,

50:56.752 --> 50:58.155
and these shutters
are two inches thick.

50:58.290 --> 51:00.125
You think
you can hack the locks?

51:00.261 --> 51:01.927
- With what Internet?
- I don't know.

51:02.063 --> 51:03.561
You-you can't do it manually?

51:03.697 --> 51:05.231
Well, even if I could,
I don't have any equipment.

51:05.367 --> 51:06.830
You know, there's got to be,
like, a control room

51:06.965 --> 51:08.067
or something.

51:08.202 --> 51:11.298
Okay. What do we know
about vampires?

51:11.434 --> 51:12.632
Th-That they're not real.

51:12.768 --> 51:14.205
What are we talking about,
like Anne Rice

51:14.341 --> 51:16.007
or <i>True Blood,</i>
you know, <i>Twilight?</i>

51:16.142 --> 51:17.878
Very different kind of vampires.

51:18.013 --> 51:19.177
Okay, we know
they feed off blood.

51:19.312 --> 51:20.442
We're really doing this
right now?

51:20.578 --> 51:21.713
They can turn other people
into vampires.

51:21.849 --> 51:23.117
Oh. Okay, fuck it.

51:23.252 --> 51:25.182
Um, they can turn into bats
and stuff like that.

51:25.318 --> 51:26.919
Mind control,
they make you do shit.

51:27.055 --> 51:28.149
They don't have a reflection.

51:28.284 --> 51:29.350
Not listening to this.

51:29.485 --> 51:30.717
Okay, how do we kill a vampire?

51:30.852 --> 51:32.386
-Garlic.
- A stake through the heart.

51:32.522 --> 51:33.720
- Crucifixes.
-Holy water.

51:33.855 --> 51:35.426
Oh, you're
a fucking priest now?

51:35.562 --> 51:37.296
- Daylight is a big one.
- Oh, that's a good one,

51:37.431 --> 51:39.396
but it's, mm, 3:30
in the fucking morning.

51:39.531 --> 51:42.301
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut the fuck up!

51:42.436 --> 51:45.303
Hey, dum-dum, we got
a real fucking situation here.

51:45.438 --> 51:47.433
So I don't give a shit
what you think.

51:47.569 --> 51:49.141
Either you're helping us,

51:49.277 --> 51:51.544
or you're 270 pounds
of dead weight.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.809
Which is it?

51:53.945 --> 51:56.282
Helping.

51:58.316 --> 52:00.517
Just don't do that again.

52:02.158 --> 52:03.417
There's pool cues
in the game room.

52:03.552 --> 52:05.489
Go sharpen 'em into stakes.

52:07.596 --> 52:09.361
Okay.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.598
You, go check the kitchen
for garlic.

52:13.734 --> 52:14.734
Alone?

52:14.869 --> 52:16.632
- Yes, alone.
- Yep.

52:18.235 --> 52:19.940
What are you thinking?

52:20.075 --> 52:21.603
I say we tool up
and we kill her.

52:21.738 --> 52:23.270
That's a mistake.
You said it yourself.

52:23.405 --> 52:24.639
This girl is smart.

52:24.775 --> 52:26.544
She's been manipulating us
from the start.

52:26.679 --> 52:28.814
We don't know if any
of this stuff is gonna work.

52:28.949 --> 52:30.283
And even if it does,

52:30.419 --> 52:32.212
killing her would be the
stupidest thing we could do.

52:32.347 --> 52:33.616
And why is that?

52:33.751 --> 52:35.085
Because we lose the only
bargaining chip we have.

52:35.220 --> 52:36.418
Well, what do you suggest?

52:36.554 --> 52:37.951
We trade her to Lazaar
for our lives.

52:38.086 --> 52:40.326
No. I'm not betting our lives
on your fucking hunch.

52:40.462 --> 52:41.655
I'm telling you,
she's gonna see you coming.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.565
No. Debate is over.
Decision made. Okay?

52:44.700 --> 52:46.361
I got 'em!

52:46.496 --> 52:48.998
Sammy, those are fucking onions.

52:49.133 --> 52:50.597
Well...

52:50.732 --> 52:52.603
I don't cook. I don't know.

52:52.739 --> 52:57.005
All right, let's go kill us
a fuckin'... vampire.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.675
Good luck.

52:59.645 --> 53:01.844
Oh, I'm not going.
I already told you why.

53:01.979 --> 53:05.582
And if you put your hand
around my neck, you'll lose it.

53:05.717 --> 53:07.716
I'm not gonna touch you.
Go put your feet up.

53:07.851 --> 53:10.316
You two, on me.
Let's hit the kitchen first.

53:10.451 --> 53:12.622
Fucking onions.

53:25.599 --> 53:27.406
Fuck.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.815
Let's fucking go.

53:44.287 --> 53:45.655
What the fuck?

54:50.926 --> 54:52.619
What's happening?

54:52.755 --> 54:55.260
Let's... let's just talk.

54:58.827 --> 55:00.667
-Fuck!
-Holy shit!

55:06.174 --> 55:08.269
Fucking help me, you fuckers!

55:52.051 --> 55:54.117
Oh, fuck!

55:54.253 --> 55:56.817
Oh! Oh! Oh! Jesus!

55:56.953 --> 55:59.858
- Oh, Christ!

56:01.089 --> 56:03.258
You're so bloody and so gross.

56:09.231 --> 56:13.102
Ah, Jesus, Mary and
motherfucking son of a bitch!

56:13.237 --> 56:15.941
Oh, fuck!

56:18.513 --> 56:21.440
Oh, if you fucking say,
"I told you so."

56:24.380 --> 56:25.716
Oh, shit.

56:25.851 --> 56:27.249
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

56:27.385 --> 56:29.721
Oh! Motherfucker!

56:29.856 --> 56:32.055
- Why didn't she kill you?
- She is fucking with us.

56:32.190 --> 56:33.591
Oh, fuck!

56:33.727 --> 56:35.526
I'm guessing
none of those weapons worked.

56:35.662 --> 56:37.596
Well, the stake worked
on my fucking leg,

56:37.731 --> 56:39.728
and she used the crucifix
on Peter like a fucking

56:39.864 --> 56:42.566
pincushion,
and the garlic did fuck all!

56:42.702 --> 56:44.431
- Shh. Shh.
-Well, I have one thing

56:44.567 --> 56:46.637
we know does work.

56:46.773 --> 56:49.871
When I jabbed her with this,
she was out, out.

56:50.007 --> 56:51.905
If we can corner her,
it's nighty-night.

56:52.040 --> 56:53.508
The Sleeping Beauty act
was bullshit.

56:53.644 --> 56:55.113
No, it wasn't.

56:55.248 --> 56:56.481
I checked her pulse,

56:56.616 --> 56:59.115
and her breathing was slow
and steady.

56:59.251 --> 57:00.751
We split up.

57:00.887 --> 57:02.981
Whoever finds her first
alerts me through the comms,

57:03.117 --> 57:04.654
and I come running
with the syringe.

57:04.790 --> 57:05.952
That's great that you're

57:06.087 --> 57:07.692
the only one
with a weapon that works.

57:07.827 --> 57:10.862
Listen, you sit here and bleed,
or you trust me.

57:10.998 --> 57:12.798
Yeah.

57:12.934 --> 57:14.193
Sammy?

57:15.565 --> 57:16.866
Okay.

57:18.841 --> 57:20.474
Fuck.

57:39.791 --> 57:41.726
-Check in.

57:42.927 --> 57:44.925
All's clear on the east side.

57:45.060 --> 57:48.062
-Nothing on two... yet.

57:48.197 --> 57:50.504
PETER
There's no vampires here.

57:51.670 --> 57:53.805
Not that I'm actually looking.

57:53.941 --> 57:55.906
Channel's
still open, dick face.

57:56.041 --> 57:59.439
Put that fucking bottle down
and fucking do something.

58:01.447 --> 58:02.911
Can she turn into a rat?

58:03.046 --> 58:04.744
'Cause I might be looking
right at her.

58:04.880 --> 58:07.085
Maybe she can join the pack.

58:07.221 --> 58:08.717
Oh, now I get it.

58:08.852 --> 58:10.552
I get the...
I get the name now.

58:10.688 --> 58:12.421
I get it. The Rat Pack, right?

58:12.556 --> 58:13.822
Yeah.

58:13.957 --> 58:16.090
PETER
That's funny.

58:37.052 --> 58:38.611
Fuck! Fuck.

58:39.916 --> 58:42.453
Sammy, your comms
are cutting out.

58:42.588 --> 58:45.625
Sammy. Sammy?

58:55.899 --> 58:58.435
-  Fuck!

59:14.083 --> 59:15.715
- What is it?

59:15.850 --> 59:17.486
There's bodies!

59:17.621 --> 59:19.958
Bodies in the pool!

59:20.094 --> 59:21.894
What?

59:22.030 --> 59:23.391
Shit.

59:27.001 --> 59:28.000
No!

59:35.405 --> 59:37.471
Huh.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.611
- Peter!

59:40.746 --> 59:43.680
I got a splinter...
on my finger.

59:43.815 --> 59:46.214
A huge one
from the stupid stick.

59:46.350 --> 59:49.117
A little more concerned with
the bodies in the pool, Peter.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.156
FRANK
How many bodies we talking?

59:51.292 --> 59:52.659
Like, two, three?

01:00:03.304 --> 01:00:05.633
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:00:10.544 --> 01:00:12.241
Peter, stop fucking around.

01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:16.048
Vampire on my ass!

01:00:19.021 --> 01:00:21.182
Vampire!

01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:23.823
Take that.

01:00:23.959 --> 01:00:28.156
All right. I got her trapped
in the upstairs hallway, so...

01:00:29.858 --> 01:00:31.227
Holy fuck! Vam...

01:00:31.363 --> 01:00:32.897
Vampire!

01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:44.375
- Oh...

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.411
Oh, shit.

01:01:12.938 --> 01:01:15.940
- Ugh. What the fuck?
- I'm here.

01:01:20.413 --> 01:01:22.081
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:01:37.959 --> 01:01:40.429
Oh, fuck.

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.000
Oh, shit.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:53.610
What color are my eyes, Frank?

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.449
FRANK
Sammy?

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:01.418
Sammy, help me!

01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:04.020
Sammy. Sammy.

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:06.656
- Sammy, help me. Sammy.

01:02:06.792 --> 01:02:09.422
- Sammy, help.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:24.008
-Oh, come on.

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.974
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:30.016
She's fucking flying!

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:34.348
- Fuck! What the fuck?!

01:02:46.093 --> 01:02:49.198
- Joey!

01:02:50.168 --> 01:02:52.305
I can't hold her much longer.
Come on!

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.871
Do it now. Come on!

01:02:54.007 --> 01:02:56.101
Joey!
Jesus fucking Christ, come on!

01:02:56.237 --> 01:02:59.208
Joey? Joey?

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:04.147
Fucking bitch!

01:03:05.279 --> 01:03:07.180
I'll kill you fucking fucks!

01:03:07.315 --> 01:03:10.017
I'll rip your fucking heads off

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:12.622
and gorge myself on your blood!

01:03:37.077 --> 01:03:38.810
Yeah?

01:03:38.946 --> 01:03:40.548
Oh, yes.

01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:50.193
Sammy?

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.900
What the fuck's gonna
happen to me?

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:57.001
How do you feel?

01:03:57.136 --> 01:03:59.633
I feel like I got bit
by a fucking vampire.

01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:04.572
What the fuck is gonna
happen to me?! Huh?!

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.243
What's gonna happen to me?

01:04:08.813 --> 01:04:10.477
I don't know.

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:16.582
Yeah.

01:04:42.582 --> 01:04:44.610
We want to talk.

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.751
Please, please let me out.

01:04:52.152 --> 01:04:54.294
I'm scared.

01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:55.823
Cut the shit.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.365
You're really good at
pretending to be a little girl.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.528
Thank you.

01:05:02.938 --> 01:05:05.099
I've had a few centuries
of experience.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.738
Tell us how to get out of here,

01:05:07.873 --> 01:05:09.505
and we'll let you go.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.007
No.

01:05:11.142 --> 01:05:13.243
Hey, what's gonna happen to me?

01:05:14.408 --> 01:05:16.644
Am I gonna turn into a vampire?

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.413
Maybe.

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:22.249
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:05:22.384 --> 01:05:23.853
- She said maybe!
- It's okay.

01:05:23.989 --> 01:05:25.854
Listen, little lady,

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.891
or ma'am, whatever.

01:05:29.027 --> 01:05:30.729
We're very sorry, okay?

01:05:30.864 --> 01:05:32.229
We didn't know who you were.

01:05:32.365 --> 01:05:34.734
We thought you were just
a regular 12-year-old girl.

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.302
You were gonna beat me
and torture me

01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:42.034
when you thought I was just
a regular 12-year-old girl.

01:05:42.169 --> 01:05:44.303
Yeah, well...

01:05:44.439 --> 01:05:46.344
Like I say, we're very sorry.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.409
We would never have taken you
if we knew who your father was.

01:05:49.544 --> 01:05:52.381
You did work for him,
didn't you?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:58.425
Haven't you wondered
why I brought you all here?

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.854
You brought us here?

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.253
Jesus Christ.

01:06:01.388 --> 01:06:03.760
There was never any money.

01:06:03.895 --> 01:06:05.993
I planned all of this.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.662
Lambert works for me.

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:14.073
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you know, Jessie?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.708
What did you just call me?

01:06:18.843 --> 01:06:20.044
Jessica Hurney.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.180
You started your career
siphoning money

01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:25.716
from your affluent parents'
bank accounts.

01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.720
Hedge funds came next,

01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:30.086
then private offshore accounts,

01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:33.657
and eventually,
much bigger fish.

01:06:33.793 --> 01:06:36.023
One in particular.

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:37.863
I can give it back.

01:06:37.999 --> 01:06:41.263
Terrence Lacroix.

01:06:41.399 --> 01:06:44.497
Muscle for the Montreal
Broussard family.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:48.073
Did it bore you,
snapping necks for pay?

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:51.138
Enduring endless taunts
from your colleagues

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:53.275
about your stunted intellect?

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:55.346
Is that why you stole
from your crew,

01:06:55.481 --> 01:06:59.952
who just happened to be a
tiny subsidiary of our empire?

01:07:00.087 --> 01:07:02.819
How long did the money last,
you weak,

01:07:02.954 --> 01:07:06.158
disloyal inebriate?

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:13.462
Former Detective Adam Barrett.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:17.470
You thought you could
infiltrate our New York arm

01:07:17.606 --> 01:07:18.798
under deep cover.

01:07:18.933 --> 01:07:21.637
But you liked the life
a little too much, didn't you?

01:07:21.773 --> 01:07:27.542
The power you had when you were
free of rules and regulations.

01:07:28.409 --> 01:07:30.308
It became an addiction.

01:07:30.443 --> 01:07:32.514
How empty did you feel

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.988
when you finally arrested
our three lieutenants

01:07:36.124 --> 01:07:39.654
you'd worked so hard
to get close to?

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:44.293
And how empty did you feel
after I ripped up their bodies

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:46.764
in the hotel penthouse
because of you?

01:07:46.899 --> 01:07:48.728
You changed your name,

01:07:48.863 --> 01:07:52.467
you left town, and you never
saw your family again.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:55.607
But it wasn't
for their safety, was it,

01:07:55.743 --> 01:07:58.276
Detective Barrett?

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:05.012
Finally, we have the tragic

01:08:05.147 --> 01:08:06.953
Ana Lucia Cruz.

01:08:07.089 --> 01:08:09.549
Former Army medic
drummed out of service

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.417
for shooting up
Uncle Sam's morphine.

01:08:12.553 --> 01:08:14.124
I was injured in the field.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:17.097
You tried
to take care of your son,

01:08:17.232 --> 01:08:20.025
before abandoning him
to his fuckup of a father.

01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:21.196
Shut up.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.768
You became an underground doctor

01:08:22.904 --> 01:08:24.236
for some very shady people.

01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:27.170
But one day, you were just
too high to do your job,

01:08:27.305 --> 01:08:29.235
and instead
of removing a bullet,

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:30.937
you nicked an artery,

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:34.940
and someone very important to
my father's business bled out.

01:08:35.075 --> 01:08:40.051
But you and Detective Barrett
have something in common.

01:08:40.186 --> 01:08:42.885
You never went back
for your son.

01:08:43.021 --> 01:08:45.290
Shut the fuck up!

01:08:46.357 --> 01:08:49.625
And what do you tell yourself, huh?

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.166
That you want to be your
daddy's little errand girl?

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.768
No, he did lose interest in you.

01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:59.098
That wasn't a lie.

01:08:59.967 --> 01:09:01.769
How many of your father's
enemies do you think

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:05.673
you're gonna have to kill
until he loves you again?

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:08.973
If this is about revenge,
why didn't you just kill us?

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:12.250
- Why'd you bring us here?
- Because it isn't.

01:09:12.386 --> 01:09:14.387
- This is just a game to her.
-Bullshit.

01:09:14.522 --> 01:09:18.055
She was screaming at the house,
and Dad triggered the alarm.

01:09:18.190 --> 01:09:21.221
That wasn't even her father.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.855
That wasn't Lazaar.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.129
And for what,
because you're fucking bored?

01:09:26.264 --> 01:09:28.568
For your fucking entertainment?

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.764
What can I say?

01:09:32.105 --> 01:09:34.105
I like playing with my food.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.835
You're the same as all the other

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.043
meat sacks I've brought here
over the years.

01:09:38.179 --> 01:09:40.239
Nothing different
about any of you.

01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:41.806
Nothing special.

01:09:41.942 --> 01:09:44.113
Just something
to help me pass the time.

01:09:44.248 --> 01:09:46.219
Quick question.

01:09:48.023 --> 01:09:51.290
Who's inside a cage right now?

01:09:51.425 --> 01:09:55.327
If you let me out,
I'll let two of you live.

01:09:55.961 --> 01:09:57.463
Oh. Which two?

01:09:57.599 --> 01:09:58.526
What?

01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:00.162
- It's a surprise.
-Fuck this.

01:10:00.298 --> 01:10:01.767
Let's just kill her now.

01:10:01.902 --> 01:10:03.266
You tried that, Frank.

01:10:03.402 --> 01:10:05.167
If you would like
to open this door

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.405
and try again, please do.

01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:09.537
My offer just expired.

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.678
Now I'll only let
one of you live--

01:10:11.813 --> 01:10:13.840
whoever lets me out.

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:18.813
She's fucking lying, moron.

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:21.381
You touch that door, you're
as dead as the rest of us.

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.020
Maybe it's worth a try.

01:10:23.156 --> 01:10:24.318
We have her, Peter.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:25.486
That's why we did this--

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:26.891
so we can trade her
for our lives.

01:10:27.027 --> 01:10:28.859
That will never happen.

01:10:28.994 --> 01:10:30.029
Joey was right.

01:10:30.164 --> 01:10:32.095
No matter how many of you
I kill,

01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:33.826
my father doesn't love me,

01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:36.396
and he's not gonna trade
anything for me.

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:39.902
So go on, Peter, let me out.

01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:42.902
Go on.

01:10:43.037 --> 01:10:45.443
Peter, if you touch that door,
I will shoot you.

01:10:47.211 --> 01:10:49.249
I'm sorry, guys.

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:59.620
- Aah! You shot me! You shot me!

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.189
I barely grazed you.
Now give me your gun

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:02.223
so I can patch you up.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.060
You're sure crazy.

01:11:04.195 --> 01:11:05.461
I prefer "impatient."

01:11:05.596 --> 01:11:07.363
Frank, help me out.
Sammy, watch her.

01:11:07.498 --> 01:11:10.367
Fuck that shit. Mm-mm.

01:11:10.503 --> 01:11:13.331
- Sammy.
- I'm not staying down here...

01:11:13.466 --> 01:11:15.071
with that.

01:11:15.206 --> 01:11:17.376
Fuck that shit, Joey.

01:11:18.076 --> 01:11:20.313
I got this.

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:23.547
Fine.

01:11:27.386 --> 01:11:29.451
-Ow.
-You okay?

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.252
Getting shot hurts, Sammy.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:33.286
Oh, fuck.

01:11:36.658 --> 01:11:38.629
The offer still stands, Frank.

01:11:38.764 --> 01:11:41.295
Open the door, and I'll let you
keep all your blood.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.800
- Oh.
- Organs, too.

01:11:43.936 --> 01:11:44.962
Sure.

01:11:45.098 --> 01:11:48.205
I'm serious.
You could be useful to us.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.506
Why don't you... tell me...

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:55.915
how to get the fuck out of here,

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.679
and I'll consider it.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.752
If I told you,
you'd just leave me here.

01:12:00.887 --> 01:12:02.850
You first.

01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:05.919
You know what?

01:12:09.227 --> 01:12:10.990
My offer just expired.

01:12:12.192 --> 01:12:15.262
Have fun spending eternity
in a fucking elevator.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:17.000
Wait.

01:12:17.136 --> 01:12:19.339
I'll tell you.

01:12:20.574 --> 01:12:24.476
But you have to let me out
immediately after I do.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:30.341
All right.

01:12:30.477 --> 01:12:32.517
Fine.

01:12:34.186 --> 01:12:36.849
It's a deal.

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:39.025
There's a secret door
in the library.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.928
The bookshelf on the right wall.

01:12:42.063 --> 01:12:44.430
<i>And Then There Were None.</i>

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.762
Hmm.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.128
Very good.

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:53.265
Thanks.

01:12:53.401 --> 01:12:54.599
Wait.

01:12:54.734 --> 01:12:56.302
A deal's a deal.

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:58.741
Oh, right.

01:13:00.212 --> 01:13:02.613
The deal.

01:13:03.843 --> 01:13:06.914
Ain't I a Silly Billy?

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:28.071
Still gullible at your age,
you fucking freak?

01:13:31.878 --> 01:13:35.745
- What's so fucking funny?

01:14:21.559 --> 01:14:23.357
- The library.
- Oh, shit.

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:26.532
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.272
You looking
for some light reading, Frank?

01:15:10.408 --> 01:15:12.875
Shut the fuck up.

01:15:20.452 --> 01:15:23.853
<i>And Then There Were None.</i>

01:15:36.369 --> 01:15:38.235
Agatha fucking Christie.

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:40.567
You fucking playing me?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:41.969
Fucking ballerina fuck.

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:46.040
Stupid fucking dancing
fucking vampire fuck!

01:15:47.378 --> 01:15:48.541
Fuck! Fuck!

01:15:51.579 --> 01:15:52.984
You good?

01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:56.385
So what the fuck now?

01:15:56.521 --> 01:15:57.715
She was already healing.

01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:59.152
You saw it, too.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:01.994
Keep an eye on the door.

01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:03.222
Stay in the light.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.609
Grab something.

01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:21.306
We're gonna break
through this wall.

01:16:28.587 --> 01:16:31.520
Will you fucking stop already?

01:16:31.656 --> 01:16:33.120
She's not going anywhere.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:36.226
She's waiting for it
to get dark, and then...

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:37.357
we're fucked!

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:38.392
Fuck!

01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:44.131
- Goddamn it.

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:55.307
Aw. You run out of candy?

01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:07.759
I'm scared.

01:17:18.865 --> 01:17:20.272
Was that true?

01:17:20.408 --> 01:17:22.939
What she said about your son?

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.678
That you left him?

01:17:29.008 --> 01:17:30.375
Yeah.

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.785
But I got clean.

01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:36.254
And I was gonna go back for him.

01:17:36.389 --> 01:17:38.453
That was...

01:17:38.589 --> 01:17:40.290
That is the plan.

01:17:40.426 --> 01:17:41.493
That's good.

01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:43.460
How often do you get
to talk to him?

01:17:43.596 --> 01:17:44.789
Tried calling him.

01:17:44.924 --> 01:17:46.996
I just, um...

01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:51.869
I can't do it.

01:17:52.737 --> 01:17:53.936
That's why I took this job.

01:17:54.071 --> 01:17:58.339
With that money,
I can start over, you know?

01:17:58.475 --> 01:17:59.837
A reset.

01:17:59.973 --> 01:18:01.575
Boo-hoo.

01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:03.409
Fucking bullshit.

01:18:03.544 --> 01:18:05.143
It's not about the money.
The money's an excuse.

01:18:05.278 --> 01:18:06.985
You didn't go back for your kid

01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:08.480
'cause you're scared of being
a piece-of-shit mother.

01:18:08.615 --> 01:18:10.919
God, everybody's got to be
a fucking victim now.

01:18:11.055 --> 01:18:12.350
"Oh, I left
'cause I was on drugs."

01:18:12.485 --> 01:18:14.123
"Oh, I was on drugs
'cause I got hurt."

01:18:14.258 --> 01:18:16.993
Own your fucking shit and go
and be a mother to that kid.

01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:21.734
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hit a fucking nerve?

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.072
Reset.

01:18:27.208 --> 01:18:28.672
Oh, my God.

01:18:28.807 --> 01:18:30.509
I don't need to hack the locks.

01:18:30.645 --> 01:18:32.203
I just need
to find a power source.

01:18:32.339 --> 01:18:33.972
And if I can find
the power source,

01:18:34.107 --> 01:18:36.209
then we can just short it.

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.978
What, are you gonna unplug
the fucking house?

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.546
Okay, we search the house.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:40.817
Two teams.

01:18:40.953 --> 01:18:42.687
And we don't stop
until we find it.

01:18:42.823 --> 01:18:44.819
Well, who's going
with Twilight here?

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.658
I'll go with you.

01:18:46.794 --> 01:18:51.657
I, uh, saw your reflection
in this earlier.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.792
Oh, my God.

01:18:53.927 --> 01:18:55.331
Let's go.

01:18:57.101 --> 01:18:59.202
-Fuck this job.
- Fucking dream team.

01:19:07.646 --> 01:19:09.414
Oh, no, no. Stay close.

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:11.145
- I got you.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.713
FRANK
Not seeing anything yet.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.286
What about you guys?

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:15.848
Eh, nothing.

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:17.356
Stay alert.

01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:19.385
She's toying with us.

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:29.096
There's nothing here.

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:31.631
You got any other bright ideas,
Nosferatu?

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.833
Goddamn it.

01:19:32.969 --> 01:19:34.907
Why did you all listen to me?

01:19:35.042 --> 01:19:37.606
This isn't gonna work.
This is so fucking stupid.

01:19:37.741 --> 01:19:39.145
- Sammy.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.374
Listen to me.

01:19:42.949 --> 01:19:46.016
You got people out there
that you care about?

01:19:47.113 --> 01:19:49.052
- Hmm?

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:51.384
Sammy.

01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:53.785
I have people, too.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:56.992
So, you and me,

01:19:57.128 --> 01:19:58.994
we're gonna go find
that power source.

01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:00.695
We're gonna get
the fuck out of here.

01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:03.366
- You think so?
- Yes.

01:20:03.502 --> 01:20:05.233
You and me.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.873
You're my friend.

01:20:10.277 --> 01:20:12.075
Okay.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.585
ABIGAIL
Jessica.

01:20:35.032 --> 01:20:37.465
-Jessica.

01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:41.573
Jessica.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:42.900
You're mine.

01:21:01.822 --> 01:21:03.194
Huh.

01:21:03.763 --> 01:21:06.461
Well, there's nothing here.

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:09.066
But don't worry, because...

01:21:09.765 --> 01:21:11.499
Sammy?

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.268
Huh.

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:31.154
- Mmm.

01:21:31.852 --> 01:21:33.250
Mmm.

01:21:33.386 --> 01:21:34.655

01:23:37.411 --> 01:23:40.052

She's still in here.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:04.903

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:06.642
Fuck.

01:24:16.316 --> 01:24:18.189
Here. Here.

01:24:28.231 --> 01:24:30.735
I've always hated this room.

01:24:30.871 --> 01:24:32.764
My father turned me in here.

01:24:33.774 --> 01:24:36.341
Lot of painful memories.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.312
But it's never too late
to make new ones.

01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:56.826
-  Holy shit.

01:24:56.961 --> 01:24:58.990
That was fucking...

01:24:59.126 --> 01:25:00.061
Whoa.

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:10.004
Now what do we do
about the real fucking problem?

01:25:18.116 --> 01:25:20.779
- Well, that's a...
- Trap?

01:25:22.715 --> 01:25:24.816
What the fuck else
are we gonna do?

01:25:50.943 --> 01:25:52.348
DEAN
<i>I'm the best</i>

JOEY
<i>I didn't say you weren't good.</i>

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.783
<i>I said you're not
a professional.</i>

01:25:59.553 --> 01:26:02.024
<i>You've got loose wiring.</i>

01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:04.488
<i>Probably a sociopath.</i>

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:09.465
FRANK
<i>And you are a junkie.</i>

01:26:13.236 --> 01:26:15.301
<i>Cop knows a junkie.</i>

01:26:15.437 --> 01:26:19.171
<i>Your little candy affectation.</i>

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:21.072
<i>Long sleeves.</i>

01:26:21.207 --> 01:26:23.710
<i>The way you don't want to
have a drink with us.</i>

01:26:24.545 --> 01:26:25.710
<i>You in recovery or something?</i>

01:26:25.846 --> 01:26:27.885
What the fuck,
you backstabbing son of a...

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:29.517
- Oh, fuck!

01:26:29.653 --> 01:26:31.051
You're one of them!
He's one of them!

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:32.354
No shit, Frank.

01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:33.818
What the fuck is happening, motherfucker?

01:26:33.953 --> 01:26:36.358
I brought you back here
to offer you a deal.

01:26:36.494 --> 01:26:38.222
We're not taking
any fucking deals.

01:26:40.264 --> 01:26:42.663
I wasn't talking to you.

01:26:43.703 --> 01:26:44.962
Shit.

01:26:49.469 --> 01:26:51.272
You fucking set me up.

01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:53.804
Abigail turned me two years ago.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:56.246
She found out
I helped you in New York.

01:26:56.382 --> 01:26:59.350
She came for me
and threatened my family.

01:26:59.486 --> 01:27:03.353
Now all I do is bring
her father's enemies here

01:27:03.488 --> 01:27:06.185
so that she can play
her little hunting game.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.257
But I am done.

01:27:09.392 --> 01:27:11.124
What's your fucking point?

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.162
You can die here,

01:27:13.297 --> 01:27:16.327
or you can help me kill Abigail.

01:27:16.463 --> 01:27:17.928
Help me take her,

01:27:18.063 --> 01:27:21.735
and you can have anything
you fucking want.

01:27:23.276 --> 01:27:24.606
But you'll need
a little upgrade.

01:27:24.742 --> 01:27:26.810
I'm not gonna become
a fucking puppet like Sammy.

01:27:26.946 --> 01:27:29.078
- Fuck no.
- No.

01:27:29.213 --> 01:27:30.444
You'd be just like me.

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.376
You'd get the complete
treatment.

01:27:32.511 --> 01:27:34.750
Total autonomy.

01:27:34.886 --> 01:27:36.013
Frank.

01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:37.217
I've told Lazaar
there's a problem.

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:38.720
He's on his way.

01:27:38.855 --> 01:27:40.985
We'll kill the girl,
we'll kill her father,

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.593
and we'll take over
the whole fucking thing.

01:27:47.196 --> 01:27:49.730
Frank. Please...

01:27:51.837 --> 01:27:52.863
Fuck it.

01:27:52.998 --> 01:27:56.308
- Bite me.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.359
Fuck!

01:28:22.934 --> 01:28:23.861
Drink.

01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:27.867
Yes, drink,
and you'll be one of us.

01:28:31.337 --> 01:28:32.577
Yes.

01:28:34.076 --> 01:28:35.644
Yes.

01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:23.588
Oh.

01:29:23.723 --> 01:29:26.026
You're still with us.

01:29:26.162 --> 01:29:28.394
Frank,

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.669
meet your first victim.

01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:53.920
That's for setting me up,
you undead prick.

01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:02.995
Oh, yeah.

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:07.905
I feel fucking great.

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.739
Frank.

01:30:14.874 --> 01:30:18.883
I told you not to fuck with me.

01:30:19.019 --> 01:30:20.644
Please.

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.316
You better fucking run.

01:30:31.562 --> 01:30:33.493
So you found Lambert.

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:34.892
Did he try to convince you

01:30:35.028 --> 01:30:37.230
to take it all
before you killed him?

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:43.673
Our game ends here.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:46.877
I've made sure of that.

01:31:28.515 --> 01:31:30.555
No. Fuck.

01:31:31.817 --> 01:31:34.218
I fucking hate ballet.

01:31:56.943 --> 01:31:59.012
BOY
<i>Hello?</i>

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:02.186
Hey, Caleb. It's Mom.

01:32:02.322 --> 01:32:04.151
<i>Gotcha. Ha-ha.</i>

01:32:04.286 --> 01:32:07.024
<i>Can't come to the phone
right now, but leave a message.</i>

01:32:08.488 --> 01:32:10.221
I...

01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:20.033
I love you so much.

01:32:22.903 --> 01:32:25.269
And I'm so proud of you.

01:32:26.777 --> 01:32:28.876
You're the one good...

01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:31.848
You're the one good thing
I did in life.

01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:35.647
And I just needed you
to hear that.

01:32:41.887 --> 01:32:44.623
I love you so much,

01:32:44.758 --> 01:32:47.863
my sweet, sweet boy.

01:32:49.501 --> 01:32:51.200
And I always have.

01:32:51.335 --> 01:32:53.000
Aw.

01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:01.272
Sorry to interrupt.

01:33:14.827 --> 01:33:17.161
It's a little late
to be a good mom now,

01:33:17.296 --> 01:33:18.624
don't you think?

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:21.565
You fucking junkie.

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:24.567
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, Frank.

01:33:29.735 --> 01:33:31.008
Oh, yeah?

01:33:59.804 --> 01:34:01.536
Why don't you just kill me?

01:34:01.672 --> 01:34:03.373
Where's the fun in that?

01:34:03.508 --> 01:34:05.306
You want to have some fun?

01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:06.843
All right.

01:34:10.614 --> 01:34:12.750
Let's have some fun.

01:34:14.886 --> 01:34:18.621
I'm gonna make you
my fucking puppet.

01:34:21.388 --> 01:34:24.990
And then we're gonna go see
that kid of yours.

01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:27.996
And I'm gonna make you kill him.

01:34:39.546 --> 01:34:41.539
I'm too weak to take him alone.

01:34:42.342 --> 01:34:45.475
Help me kill him,
and I'll let you go.

01:34:46.145 --> 01:34:48.983
You can see your son again.

01:34:49.119 --> 01:34:52.355
♪ I got the whole
fucking world ♪

01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:54.693
♪ In my hands. ♪

01:34:55.526 --> 01:34:57.894
Well, well, well.

01:34:59.895 --> 01:35:02.426
Look who came to join the party.

01:35:05.803 --> 01:35:07.766
If you want to kill me,

01:35:07.901 --> 01:35:09.972
you have to drain me.

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:16.434
Wait there.

01:36:18.543 --> 01:36:20.438
Isn't this fun?

01:37:22.134 --> 01:37:24.909
No. No.

01:37:30.749 --> 01:37:32.917
You ready to join the team?

01:37:41.052 --> 01:37:43.224
Oh, yeah.

01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:02.375
Wakey-wakey, little puppet.

01:38:07.453 --> 01:38:09.312
Oh, hey there.

01:38:09.448 --> 01:38:12.583
I think it's time to play...

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.224
...my game.

01:38:18.323 --> 01:38:23.033
Frank says, "Pick it up."

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.319
Frank says, "Get the fuck up."

01:38:50.422 --> 01:38:53.558
Frank says, "Kill the girl."

01:39:13.586 --> 01:39:15.452
Oh, God!

01:39:15.587 --> 01:39:17.115
You little fuck!

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.283
You don't fucking quit.

01:39:18.418 --> 01:39:20.524
You thought you could just

01:39:20.659 --> 01:39:21.919
make her your puppet?

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:51.248
Here's the thing about
being a vampire, Frank.

01:39:51.384 --> 01:39:54.022
It takes a long fucking time

01:39:54.158 --> 01:39:56.654
to learn how to do
all the cool shit.

01:39:57.694 --> 01:39:59.426
Oh, fu...

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.784
Thank you.

01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:36.166
No problem.

01:40:52.551 --> 01:40:53.984
Am I...?

01:40:54.119 --> 01:40:56.681
You're fine, now that he's dead.

01:41:12.538 --> 01:41:14.204
Um...

01:41:15.874 --> 01:41:18.109
I think I'm gonna...

01:41:20.612 --> 01:41:22.476
Yeah.

01:41:29.053 --> 01:41:31.419
I hope you get Justin back.

01:41:38.191 --> 01:41:40.023
It's Caleb.

01:41:40.159 --> 01:41:42.463
I know.

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:48.370
For what it's worth,
you just have to show up.

01:41:53.779 --> 01:41:55.006
- Father.

01:42:06.152 --> 01:42:07.951
Lazaar.

01:42:08.554 --> 01:42:11.289
I've gone by many names

01:42:11.424 --> 01:42:14.156
over the countless years.

01:42:17.429 --> 01:42:18.903
Father, don't.

01:42:19.038 --> 01:42:20.369
I can smell your blood.

01:42:20.505 --> 01:42:21.939
-You don't understand.
- I can taste it.

01:42:22.074 --> 01:42:23.772
-Please stop!

01:42:23.908 --> 01:42:25.167
She saved my life!

01:42:25.303 --> 01:42:27.376
Abigail!

01:42:29.345 --> 01:42:33.910
She was here when you weren't.

01:42:35.217 --> 01:42:38.849
I came when you needed me.

01:42:43.254 --> 01:42:45.163
Oh.

01:43:01.473 --> 01:43:03.544
I'm here now.

01:43:17.125 --> 01:43:19.296
Mmm.

01:43:22.297 --> 01:43:24.829
I think you should leave.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.270
It's getting awfully close

01:43:33.405 --> 01:43:36.544
to dinnertime.

01:43:39.016 --> 01:43:41.516
See you around, Joey.
