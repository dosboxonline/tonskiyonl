00:04.629 --> 00:06.715
Do you have a little time
for saving the planet?

00:06.798 --> 00:08.008
No, I don't!
No, I don't!

00:08.091 --> 00:09.884
But you have time
to hide in a bush?

00:09.968 --> 00:13.346
It's important to me,
so I make the time.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.140
Pardon me,
do you want clean air?

00:15.223 --> 00:17.642
We're not asking for anything!

00:17.726 --> 00:19.144
Just handing out information!

00:19.227 --> 00:21.187
That's not a risk
I'm willing to take!

00:21.271 --> 00:22.772
Sorry, babe.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.900
I'm sure we can trick somebody
into taking a flyer.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.777
We're not trying
to trick anybody, Jeff.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.612
Really?

00:29.696 --> 00:32.490
All I'm trying to do is
make the world a better place.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.493
Beep! Beep!
Backing up, backing up!

00:35.577 --> 00:38.204
Hey, you don't own the roads!

00:38.288 --> 00:40.665
-Roger?
-Dr. Sunny Sunderson.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.585
If you or anyone you know
is interested in going solar,

00:43.668 --> 00:44.878
fill one of these out

00:44.961 --> 00:47.630
and leave it in that
dead ficus tree on 18th Street.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.674
I won't let the USPS on my property

00:49.758 --> 00:53.261
'cause I don't engage with any business
that produces greenhouse gases.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.638
I use no fossil fuels!

00:55.764 --> 00:58.516
"Dr. Sunny Sunderson's SunSuckers."

00:58.600 --> 01:00.935
Wait, is this one
of your blowjob businesses?

01:01.019 --> 01:04.606
Dr. Sunny Sunderson's SunSuckers
is one of the cleanest

01:04.689 --> 01:06.816
and greenest businesses in the world!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
Just loaded up on supplies.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.527
Seaweed sheet?

01:09.611 --> 01:12.530
Wait, Roger, you really own
a solar business?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.532
-Want to come see my shop?
-Might as well.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.992
-What's the address?
-No.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.786
You come with me
or you don't come at all.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.954
-But we have Jeff's van.
-No fossil fuels!

01:21.289 --> 01:22.874
Come on,
move the tricycle, pal!

01:22.957 --> 01:25.794
This is a recumbent bike, buddy.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.587
More like a repugnant bike.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.048
Oh, yeah?
Well, try this on for size.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.426
Yeah, you better run--

01:33.551 --> 01:35.220
Oh, he's not running,
he's getting out.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.763
Everyone on the bike!
Let's go!

01:39.474 --> 01:42.310
Good morning, USA

01:42.393 --> 01:46.106
I got a feelin' that
It's gonna be a wonderful day

01:46.189 --> 01:49.359
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:49.442 --> 01:53.196
And he's shinin' a salute
To the American race

01:55.573 --> 01:58.701
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

01:58.785 --> 02:01.246
Good morning, USA

02:01.329 --> 02:02.330
Ah!

02:03.832 --> 02:06.626
Good morning, USA

02:10.880 --> 02:12.382
Who has
the TV Listings Booklet?

02:12.465 --> 02:13.508
The what?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.593
The booklet in the Sunday paper
that tells you

02:15.677 --> 02:17.929
when every show is on
so you can plan out your week,

02:18.012 --> 02:19.848
decide what days of work to skip.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.100
-They still make that?
-Why do you need it?

02:22.183 --> 02:25.895
I thought you had every channel
and every program memorized.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.480
Because sometimes they change it.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.607
I thought you said
you could anticipate

02:29.691 --> 02:32.318
changes in programming
even before the networks.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.195
That is true, I can do that.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.115
But what's even truer is my love
for antiquated practices

02:37.198 --> 02:39.075
long after they're deemed useless.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.287
Greg, Stan Smith from across the street.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.372
Yes, it has been a good, long while.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.708
I was wondering if you got
your TV Listings Booklet

02:46.791 --> 02:48.334
with your paper today.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.170
Oh, okay.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.588
Oh, really?

02:52.088 --> 02:55.633
He got his today, but he didn't
get his last week.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.719
I think we have on our hands

02:57.802 --> 03:00.138
a TV Listings Booklet thief.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.100
Oh, my God, this is serious!

03:04.684 --> 03:05.727
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

03:05.810 --> 03:07.395
My SunSuckers perform better

03:07.478 --> 03:09.480
than any other solar panel on the market

03:09.564 --> 03:12.775
'cause they don't just capture
the sun, they suck it in.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.527
This is great.

03:14.611 --> 03:17.864
I didn't know you had personas
who cared about the greater good.

03:17.947 --> 03:20.325
Yeah, they care so I don't have to.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.243
Hey, Dale, how's the wife?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
She came back!

03:23.661 --> 03:25.955
Are you installing
my final solar panel today?

03:26.831 --> 03:29.083
Hey, I gave you
my six-month guarantee,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.294
and then a couple
of four-month guarantees,

03:31.377 --> 03:33.504
and then my famous
29-month guarantee,

03:33.588 --> 03:36.049
and I finished only three months late.

03:36.799 --> 03:41.262
I came up with the idea for the SunSucker
while scuba diving out in Mollusk Bay.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.098
I almost got my face ripped off
by an octopus.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.559
As it brought me
into its siphon, I thought,

03:46.643 --> 03:49.020
"What if I could do this to the sun?"

03:49.103 --> 03:50.897
And suck it in!

03:50.980 --> 03:52.273
Exactly.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.526
Now I'm gonna use it to turn Langley Falls
completely solar.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.321
That's amazing.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.160
We're good. Everyone's good.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.209
Built it all myself,

04:11.334 --> 04:13.711
everything running
off SunSuckers, of course.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.880
This is a real solar company.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.882
Of course it's real.
Why wouldn't it be real?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.969
It's just always so hard for me
to understand what you can do.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.763
I mean, this looks like
a lifetime's worth of work,

04:23.846 --> 04:25.431
and yet I know yesterday,

04:25.515 --> 04:28.351
you spent the whole day
as taco inspector Feliz Nachodad.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.520
So you do understand.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.398
Now let me show you the beads.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.817
My beautiful beads.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.945
This full tub represents
all the pollution in Langley.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.156
Each bead is 1,000 tons
of carbon dioxide.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.826
I never do anything
to add to this pile.

04:45.827 --> 04:50.164
And every time I install a solar panel,
I move one bead to mark my progress.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.336
That's the fifth unit I've installed
in the last 2 1/2 years.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.381
And I'm not stopping
'til I fill the whole thing.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.467
But it's gonna take you
like 1,000 years to do that.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.635
Okay?

05:03.511 --> 05:06.222
And these are all customers
you don't have time to get to?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.224
I'm going as fast as I can!

05:08.308 --> 05:11.436
Unless you know a better route
to recumbent bike cycle into town,

05:11.519 --> 05:14.105
because that commute alone
takes up 95% of my day.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.982
Yes! We can use Jeff's van.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.026
No fossil fuels!

05:18.109 --> 05:20.153
No, listen, it would just be
in the beginning,

05:20.236 --> 05:22.238
-and in the long run--
-You're trying to trick me.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.365
I will not be tricked again!

05:24.449 --> 05:26.451
I was on the Bell Labs crew that designed

05:26.534 --> 05:29.620
the first commercial
silicon solar cell in 1954.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.873
I had big dreams,
the kind of dreams

05:31.956 --> 05:33.499
I would never share with you.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.084
Like what dreams?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.005
Like a giant needle to the sky
with a SuperDuperSunSucker

05:39.088 --> 05:41.341
on top
that could power an entire town.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.010
Hey, I said I wasn't gonna
share my dreams with you.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.431
Last time somebody promised to help me,
I was tricked into accidentally designing

05:48.514 --> 05:51.768
the F-350 Super Duty truck
for Ford Motor Company.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.188
We're not trying to trick you.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.356
Really?

05:56.689 --> 05:59.025
I work alone now, just like the sun.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.568
But don't you see?

06:00.651 --> 06:02.987
That's why the sun is so sad.

06:04.989 --> 06:09.827
Someday I'll find someone
to share this life with.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.247
Why can't you see me?

06:16.334 --> 06:19.212
The world doesn't have time
to wait for Roger to save it.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.882
If we create a tiny bit of pollution now
to move things along quicker,

06:22.965 --> 06:24.926
his clean energy
could power all of Langley.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.344
Pollution, babe?

06:26.427 --> 06:28.596
Doesn't that betray his whole philosophy?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.598
Oh, so you're a philosopher now?

06:30.681 --> 06:32.850
Well, wrap your big brain around this.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.436
I happen to know an anonymous customer

06:35.520 --> 06:38.940
just gifted Dr. Sunderson
a three-night stay

06:39.023 --> 06:40.983
at the Thermal Spas in Redbluff.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.276
Oh, that's nice.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.862
He'll like that
as long as it's not fossils.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.531
He hates fossils.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.450
He's always like,
"No fossils, fools!"

06:55.581 --> 06:57.417
Goodbye, sweet sunflowers.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.377
I'll be back in nine days.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.296
His dumb bike!

07:02.380 --> 07:04.298
It's a three-day ride each way.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.425
This is it.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.427
This is my opportunity
to save the Earth.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.392
Jeff, move our office into the trailer.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.145
Langley Comcast,
how may I help you?

07:17.228 --> 07:20.940
Yes, I would like phone and Internet
installed at a business I definitely own.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.318
Great! The fact that you say
you definitely own the business

07:24.402 --> 07:26.195
means we can
part with all the paperwork

07:26.279 --> 07:27.738
and send someone there
right away.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.116
Good, because I definitely
own this business.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.785
Good, because that's why
we said we could help you.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.001
Wish I could stay forever,
but that would cut into

07:40.084 --> 07:43.212
my 1,000-year plan to turn
Langley Falls completely solar.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.506
Well, we wouldn't want
to keep you from that.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.217
I feel like you're being
really rude right now.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.011
Is this because of
the multiple accidents

07:50.094 --> 07:52.013
I had in the hot stone room?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.766
I feel like this is undoing
all the relaxation

07:55.850 --> 07:56.893
I've accomplished here.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.644
Now I'm tense like this.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.396
My whole body's in a knot.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.523
Oh! Not my b-hole.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.525
Holly, could you be a dear
and grab a towel?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.569
It's the stone room all over again.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.280
Here's the plan.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.949
This Sunday,
TV Listings Booklet day,

08:12.033 --> 08:14.660
we will be in positions
by 4:30 a.m.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.496
I'll be in the back of the SUV.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.748
We'll have Klaus on lookout
at the end of the block.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.084
Steve, you'll be on Greg's roof
with night-vision goggles.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.296
Does Greg know that?
H-He's a gun owner!

08:25.379 --> 08:27.340
Francine, you'll be
at the living-room window

08:27.423 --> 08:28.966
running supplies from the house.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.052
Stan, I'm gonna be sleeping.

08:31.135 --> 08:34.055
Do you even care to know
what's going on on television?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.015
I use the guide button, Stan.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.517
Well, do you care
about the principle of it?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.894
-No, I do not.
-I care, Stan.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.230
I care about everything
you care about.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.399
What the hell?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.069
My name and likeness
on a gas guzzler?

08:48.736 --> 08:49.904
You're back!

08:49.987 --> 08:52.073
Have you been driving
around town with my face

08:52.156 --> 08:54.742
-all over your dang pollution wagon?
-Wait, Roger--

08:54.825 --> 08:56.536
You're making a fraud out of me!

08:56.619 --> 08:59.330
It's the F-350 Super Duty all over again!

08:59.413 --> 09:01.290
I'm gonna kill myself!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.088
Looks like
your computer crashed.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.592
Now that I'm laughing,
I see there's still something to live for.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.386
Listen, we're not tricking you.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.555
We're helping you. Look!

09:17.056 --> 09:18.307
My beads.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.270
Since you left, we used
less than a bead's worth of fossil fuels.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.939
The bad bin.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.942
And while you were gone,

09:28.025 --> 09:30.570
we installed
eight new SunSuckers.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.243
So many.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.078
Now, isn't that better?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.210
It is better.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.212
Look, we all want the same thing.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.673
A carnitas burrito from La Blahteca?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.884
To save the planet
by getting rid of fossil fuels.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.928
And I believe if we do this,

09:56.012 --> 09:58.097
we can fill that good bin all the way.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.267
Okay, we can use
a little bit of fossil fuels.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.019
Thank you!

10:04.020 --> 10:05.479
Wow.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.064
This is...

10:07.690 --> 10:09.108
really good.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.529
Let the sunshine

10:13.779 --> 10:17.283
Let the sunshine in

10:17.366 --> 10:21.537
The sunshine in

10:21.621 --> 10:25.875
Let the sunshine

10:25.958 --> 10:29.378
Let the sunshine in

10:29.462 --> 10:33.966
The sunshine in

10:34.050 --> 10:37.386
Let the sunshine

10:37.470 --> 10:41.515
-Oh, let it shine
-Let the sunshine in

10:41.599 --> 10:44.769
-Come on
-The sunshine in

10:44.852 --> 10:46.520
Everybody just sing along

10:46.604 --> 10:50.107
Let the sunshine

10:50.191 --> 10:52.568
Because
Dr. Sunderson's SunSuckers

10:52.652 --> 10:55.738
don't just capture the sun,
they suck it in.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.573
So, let us suck you off...

10:57.657 --> 10:59.033
fossil fuels...

10:59.116 --> 11:01.577
And into solar energy!

11:01.661 --> 11:04.413
Tonight, we visit with
Dr. Sunny Sunderson

11:04.497 --> 11:05.790
and his SunSuckers

11:05.873 --> 11:09.585
to find out what they're doing
to eliminate fossil fuels.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.963
And as soon as I had the idea,
the octopus just released me,

11:13.047 --> 11:15.466
and I'm working on new ideas
all the time.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.719
This is a model
of a giant water misting system

11:18.803 --> 11:20.388
that could cool a whole town.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.640
All winter, it sucks in moisture.

11:22.723 --> 11:26.060
Then in the summer,
the fan blows it all out in a cool mist.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.104
The key is this orifice.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.980
Can you guess
where I got the idea?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.400
Uh... cat's butthole?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.694
No! The middle of a starfish.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.405
Oh. And what is this?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.408
That's my life's dream,
and it's almost done.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.076
Come on!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.536
How did I not notice this?

11:43.619 --> 11:45.663
I wanted to build it all the way
to the stratosphere,

11:45.746 --> 11:48.165
but Langley's got
all these dumb ordinances.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.834
Turns out you can't build
anything higher

11:49.917 --> 11:52.628
than the Sharks Nest out of
respect for the Bazooka Sharks.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.338
- 'Zooka Sharks!
- Hell yeah, buddy!

11:54.422 --> 11:56.048
This is our year!

11:56.132 --> 11:59.218
My money's actually on
the Tampa Taserdactyls. They're tough.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.762
Their domestic-violence
record speaks for itself.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.933
Now, Ms. Smith, Dr. Sunderson
was in business for...

12:06.016 --> 12:08.978
years, but it wasn't until
you came on board

12:09.061 --> 12:10.396
that all this happened.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.731
What did you do?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.232
Look, he's the genius.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.359
I just try to keep him organized.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.777
She's being modest.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.822
She taught me that even if it seems like
you're doing something bad,

12:19.905 --> 12:22.533
it's okay as long as it ends up
being more good than bad.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.745
Just got to keep the beads
moving in the right direction.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.621
I'm sorry, what are the beads?

12:27.705 --> 12:29.498
The beads are everything.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.917
I never did learn
what the beads were,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.627
but one thing I did learn,

12:33.711 --> 12:36.338
Dr. Sunderson is
on to something special.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.591
When we come back,
an Amazonian tribe

12:38.674 --> 12:41.051
that's never had contact
with the outside world,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.555
and yet knows every word
to Taylor Swift's

12:44.638 --> 12:46.390
You Need to Calm Down.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.267
Mm, have you guys had

12:48.350 --> 12:50.770
these sour cream and onion
seaweed snacks yet?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.938
I like them.
You can throw 'em way farther.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.106
What's wrong?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.859
Langley Gas & Electric
must've seen us on the show.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.361
They're undercutting us
to put us out of business.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.447
They can't,
we have 30% of the market.

13:01.530 --> 13:05.117
-Had. We already lost half our customers.
-We'll win 'em back.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.703
Langley Gas & Electric
are offering us a lifeline.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.123
They'd raise their prices again
for a minority share

13:11.207 --> 13:12.875
of Dr. Sunderson's SunSuckers.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.835
Never!

13:15.503 --> 13:17.671
Sour cream's got some zip to it.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.928
Steve, you took off
your night-vision goggles.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.889
The sun's coming up!
It's stinging my eyes!

13:26.972 --> 13:29.141
Face it, no one's coming
to steal your precious

13:29.225 --> 13:30.935
TV Listings thing.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.895
I'll wait all day, Stan.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.355
All right, fine.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.273
- Abort mission.
- Yes!

13:36.357 --> 13:38.984
We're on the same page, Stan.
Total abortion.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.362
The thief probably didn't strike

13:41.445 --> 13:43.489
because he spotted Steve
on the roof.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.616
He probably saw you on the corner.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.409
You were checking Instagram
every two minutes.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.203
Oh, Steve, you want
to freakin' "@" me?

13:49.286 --> 13:51.163
But the thief did strike.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.582
We're missing
the TV Listings Booklet.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.546
Oh, you must feel
so stupid now, Steve.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.841
Babe, cheer up.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.426
So big business
crushed the little guy again

14:04.510 --> 14:06.595
and you're not gonna
be able to save the world.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.389
Doesn't mean
it's the end of the world.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.807
I figured it out!

14:09.890 --> 14:12.059
We can save the business
without bowing

14:12.142 --> 14:13.978
to Langley Gas & Electric!

14:15.396 --> 14:16.730
I didn't see this either?

14:16.814 --> 14:17.982
Don't beat yourself up.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.901
There was a Charles Barkley
Fathead here until yesterday.

14:23.737 --> 14:27.908
Whoa, this is the nicest
treehouse I've ever been in.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.535
You do the honors.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.744
What is this?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.913
Push it.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.796
Roger, what have you done?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.757
We've blown up all
the gas stations, power plants,

14:43.841 --> 14:45.759
and oil refineries in Langley.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.553
I called them in first,
so no one got hurt,

14:47.636 --> 14:49.763
but those power plants
are toast.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.683
Now Langley will have no choice
but to use our solar.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.476
I know it looks like
a lot of pollution,

14:54.560 --> 14:57.021
but in the long run, it's
actually better for the Earth,

14:57.104 --> 14:59.982
and you taught me
that's all that matters.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.197
Wow, I didn't anticipate
these fires

15:07.281 --> 15:08.741
when I blew up
those power plants.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.200
At least they're pretty.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.785
Why are they spreading?

15:13.245 --> 15:16.540
They're spreading because
they're burning back to their source,

15:16.624 --> 15:18.292
the Great Eastern Pipeline.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.461
Roger, what happens
if they hit the pipeline?

15:20.544 --> 15:24.006
That's what we energy scientists
call a big kabloomy.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.343
Yep, if it reaches the pipeline,
all of Langley will be gone.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.427
Except the fires.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.013
Those might end up being
seriously eternal flames.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.390
Playing Eternal Flame
by The Bangles.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.102
I said, "Seriously eternal flames,"

15:37.186 --> 15:39.188
not, "Siri, play 'Eternal Flame.'"

15:39.271 --> 15:40.689
Sometimes she's so stupid.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.858
You know what, you know,
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.693
-I like this song.
-Roger!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.237
How long do we have before
the fire hits the pipeline?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.990
Long enough to listen to this
song without being yelled at.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.700
We can't let the town burn!

15:51.784 --> 15:53.285
Because the town
is where we live!

15:53.369 --> 15:54.912
Do you feel the same

15:54.995 --> 15:56.330
I hate to harp on this,

15:56.413 --> 15:58.499
but in the end,
this will help our company.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.251
We're the only game in town.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.462
Is this burning

16:03.545 --> 16:05.589
The smoke's blocking the sun!

16:07.299 --> 16:08.384
That's no good.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.970
The sun's like our number-one
source of solar energy.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
Let's just think.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.223
How can we put out those fires?

16:14.306 --> 16:17.851
Okay, time to put every last bit
of my mental energy

16:17.935 --> 16:20.479
into saving the--
Oh, my God, I love this part.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.481
Say my name

16:22.564 --> 16:25.067
Sun shines through the rain

16:25.150 --> 16:26.318
A whole life

16:32.741 --> 16:35.911
End of days is here again, bitches!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.621
What is happening?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.541
Attention viewers,
the world is ending!

16:40.624 --> 16:45.295
I'm reporting news like this
because there is no TV anymore.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.422
No TV?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.882
But what about the TV Listings
Booklets every Sunday?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.051
Kiss 'em goodbye, baby!

16:51.385 --> 16:53.804
No!

16:53.887 --> 16:57.307
No!

17:00.936 --> 17:02.855
Maybe if I just
start saying words,

17:02.938 --> 17:04.189
something will click.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.524
Yodel.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.734
Marble.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.403
-Chartreuse.
-Stop.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.156
Face it, this is
a giant disaster.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.991
Giant!
That's it!

17:14.074 --> 17:15.617
My giant misters!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
They've been storing moisture
all winter.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.246
They can blow out the fires!

17:19.329 --> 17:20.873
But all you have is a model.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.542
But what do you think
the model was based on?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.127
The real thing.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.923
Man, I'm missing everything.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.092
It's hooked up to
my SuperDuperSunSucker.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.179
-We just need to power it up.
-But the sunlight isn't hitting it.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.263
Oh, no?

17:36.346 --> 17:38.849
Well, don't tell Sheri
at city planning,

17:38.932 --> 17:41.727
but I built this tower
with a telescoping shaft.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.896
But how are you gonna get
the solar panel

17:43.979 --> 17:46.065
above the clouds
with no electricity?

17:46.648 --> 17:49.026
With good old-fashioned
leg-tricity.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.792
This is crazy high!

18:07.711 --> 18:09.797
Jeff, activate the misters.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.431
It's working!

18:21.183 --> 18:22.226
What the hell?

18:28.023 --> 18:30.359
Something's stuck on the spire!

18:35.155 --> 18:36.740
Holy cow!

18:38.200 --> 18:40.702
It was a Telemundo satellite!

18:41.161 --> 18:44.164
I was practically raised
on Sabado Gigante.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.875
Telemundo rules,
Univision drools!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.585
The satellite
is blocking the sun

18:48.669 --> 18:50.546
from hitting
the SuperDuperSunSucker!

18:50.629 --> 18:53.382
Maybe if we move
the SuperDuperSunSucker.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.562
Roger, stop!

19:06.645 --> 19:08.105
But this is all my fault.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.482
No.
I did this.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.234
You were helping the Earth.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.653
It wasn't much,
but it was something.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.447
And then I came along and tried
to make a big difference,

19:17.531 --> 19:19.825
and now all of Langley
is burning to the ground.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.619
You're optimistic enough
to try to do big things.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.871
That's not a problem.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.456
-I'm the one with the problem.
-What's that?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.375
I'm loco, ese.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.337
The sun!
We're back in business!

19:33.255 --> 19:34.756
Roger!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.675
It's okay, sun's hitting it.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.260
We're good, everyone's good.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.065
It's working!

19:52.191 --> 19:54.651
The misters are extinguishing
the fires!

19:54.735 --> 19:56.737
I guess I could've just thrown this.

20:03.827 --> 20:07.164
So you guys didn't even get in trouble
for all the damage you did?

20:07.247 --> 20:10.000
Oh, no, Langley Gas & Electric
totally bailed us out.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.544
I just had to give them
my character's science stuff.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.296
I had fun saving the world.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.256
Jeff, we didn't save the world.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.468
We realized a vision of what the world
could be and squandered it.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.471
If anything, we set clean energy
back decades.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.805
Well, I had fun.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.724
Hey, we didn't get any closure

20:25.807 --> 20:28.227
on who was stealing
our TV Listings Booklets.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.937
Ugh, I'm so over that.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.023
You know, honestly,
I'm just happy everyone's safe.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.025
Well, I'm gonna go take a dump.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.571
You sly little devil.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.911
That's right.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.080
It was your boy Stan
the whole time.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.957
I've been stealing these
from myself

20:50.040 --> 20:51.541
and my neighbors for years.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.876
Why?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.836
The better question is...

20:54.920 --> 20:56.338
who?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.548
Who am I talking to right now?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.093
What is happening?

21:02.302 --> 21:03.971
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
