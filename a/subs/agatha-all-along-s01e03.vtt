WEBVTT

00:11.041 --> 00:12.291
Take me to the Witches' Road!

00:12.291 --> 00:14.250
[Agatha] I don't know
where you heard about The Road,

00:14.250 --> 00:15.666
but it will kill you.

00:15.666 --> 00:17.375
[Teen] <i>It'll give you
the thing you want most.</i>

00:17.375 --> 00:20.125
But we do need a coven to access The Road.

00:20.125 --> 00:22.750
Lilia. I need a Divination Witch.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.083
Jen!

00:24.083 --> 00:25.208
I need a Potions guy.

00:25.791 --> 00:28.125
Alice Wu Gulliver?
We're looking for a Protection Witch

00:28.125 --> 00:30.333
to join us on the Witches' Road.
What do you say?

00:30.333 --> 00:31.791
Where's our Green Witch?

00:31.791 --> 00:33.750
Oh, I know who it is.
I'll just go get her.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.083
- You look fabulous!
- Thank you, Mrs. Hart.

00:37.083 --> 00:40.541
- No, my real name is Sharon Davis.
- Right.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.291
All we need to do is sing the Ballad,
and a door will appear.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.208
Because we should really go, like,
right now.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.500
[grunts]

01:17.791 --> 01:19.291
It's exactly how I pictured it.

01:20.208 --> 01:21.208
Yes.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
It suits you.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.000
You didn't think it was real, did ya?

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
And you did?

01:29.916 --> 01:31.666
You know what this is?

01:33.458 --> 01:35.666
This is a kidnapping,

01:35.666 --> 01:40.541
and I think it is high time
we involve the local authorities.

01:40.541 --> 01:43.375
Are we gonna ignore the fact
that something chased us down here?

01:43.375 --> 01:45.000
Chased Agatha.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.166
Okay, no cell service.

01:50.583 --> 01:51.666
[Mrs. Hart sighs]

01:52.500 --> 01:56.125
Well, whatever chased Agatha down here,
it's our problem now.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.750
Is that because covens share
blessings and burdens alike?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.791
Someone really needs to call
this kid's parents.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.750
I'm 100% positive
they're asleep. Unless...

02:05.750 --> 02:09.541
Is this like perpetual night?
Like, as a vibe?

02:09.541 --> 02:14.791
Okay. I am a member
of the Westview Historical Society.

02:14.791 --> 02:17.583
All I would've expected to see down here

02:17.583 --> 02:20.916
were remnants
of our failed public transit system.

02:20.916 --> 02:24.708
Helpful interjection, random woman
with no obvious magical qualities.

02:24.708 --> 02:28.583
- Hey, she has a name! It's Mrs. Hart.
- Sharon.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.458
Well, whoever she is,
she has no business on The Road.

02:31.458 --> 02:34.125
- That's what I'm saying.
- Anyone can be a witch with training.

02:34.125 --> 02:37.125
Which puts the rest of us
in even more danger

02:37.125 --> 02:39.083
and we don't even know
what we're up against.

02:41.625 --> 02:42.750
"Tame your fears."

02:44.500 --> 02:46.125
That's what we're up against.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.000
Our worst nightmares.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.916
[Jen] But in what form?

02:50.916 --> 02:52.000
Trials.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.541
At least that's what the song says.

02:58.041 --> 02:59.250
What are they like?

03:05.458 --> 03:08.291
The Road will test us

03:08.875 --> 03:10.833
and our knowledge of the craft.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.125
One trial for each skill.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.625
How do we pass them without any power?

03:19.041 --> 03:21.541
Well, there's always analog magic.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.916
You know, labor-intensive,
manual acts of magic.

03:28.916 --> 03:31.625
Witchcraft, emphasis on the craft.

03:31.625 --> 03:32.916
Again, who are you?

03:33.583 --> 03:34.583
I'm... [voice distorts]

03:37.166 --> 03:41.000
Well, I'll be.
Someone's put a sigil on that boy.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.083
A what?

03:43.375 --> 03:47.250
[scoffs] Don't look at me. I didn't put
that clumsy glamour on him.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.958
Sigils are beneath me.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.708
A "sigil" is a spell?

03:50.708 --> 03:53.541
A sigil is a redaction spell
that hides something.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.750
In this case, you, from witch folk.

03:57.416 --> 04:00.333
Looks like Agatha
brought a sparkly little mystery with her.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.958
She was probably trying
to keep him all to herself.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.625
Why would someone wanna hide me?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Look.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.875
I have no idea what's under that sigil.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.625
He could be something special,

04:12.625 --> 04:15.916
or he could be a pest that a cranky witch
stashed under a rock.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.708
We can crack him open later.

04:18.083 --> 04:22.375
The real value
lies at the end of The Road.

04:24.708 --> 04:25.708
So...

04:27.625 --> 04:29.291
If you want to unbind,

04:32.625 --> 04:34.875
and you want to reverse your fortune,

04:38.375 --> 04:41.083
and you wanna find out
what happened to mommy,

04:44.750 --> 04:45.791
and you...

04:46.875 --> 04:47.875
Wait, where's Mrs. Hart?

04:49.916 --> 04:52.750
I mean, you take your eyes
off of her for two seconds...

04:57.166 --> 04:58.416
Don't touch me.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.000
Oh, my God.

05:02.375 --> 05:04.166
There has to be a way outta here.

05:06.916 --> 05:08.791
Oh. Oh!

05:10.250 --> 05:13.125
Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.208
Catching my breath.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.958
Catching my breath. Okay.

05:28.666 --> 05:33.875
What in the world! Stop! Stop!
No, no, oh, my God.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.291
No, this came from Talbots.
You can't have it.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.291
Stop! Oh, my God.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.375
No...

05:40.375 --> 05:42.333
- [Mrs. Hart screams]
- Where is she?

05:42.708 --> 05:43.916
[Teen] Mrs. Hart?

05:43.916 --> 05:47.541
Help me! Getting lower, witch people.

05:47.541 --> 05:50.750
This has been a very, very bad day.
Oh, my God!

05:50.750 --> 05:53.166
- Mrs. Hart!
- This is not the way to go!

05:53.583 --> 05:56.666
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, okay. Come on.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.458
Okay, all right. Here we go.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.375
[Agatha] I'm not gonna...

06:06.375 --> 06:08.708
[Mrs. Hart] Jeezy Louisey!

06:08.708 --> 06:10.416
You can't just walk off
The Road like that.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.500
[Mrs. Hart scoffs]

06:13.916 --> 06:18.000
This is just a really, really,
really horrible party.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.291
[Agatha] Well, I thought that
this was pretty obvious.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.500
But for the uninitiated,

06:22.958 --> 06:24.375
rule number one,

06:25.625 --> 06:30.041
- do not step off The Road.
- Oh.

06:30.625 --> 06:31.916
"I stray not from the path."

06:32.500 --> 06:34.083
Yes, thank you, Teen.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.750
So, if we just follow the instructions
of the Ballad,

06:37.750 --> 06:40.208
we'll be safe as kittens. Okay?

06:40.208 --> 06:44.166
Well, I don't know how you expect me
to walk and walk and walk

06:44.166 --> 06:47.125
- when there is nowhere to walk to?
- Right.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.875
Look.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.916
Was that there before?

07:15.166 --> 07:17.041
We should stop asking that question.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.291
Now, this is a house.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.083
Right off your vision board.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.083
Maybe this is the end.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.583
That would be such a bummer.

07:47.833 --> 07:48.833
Sorry.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.916
The phases of the moon.

08:05.541 --> 08:08.458
- It's full. The water phase.
- Huh.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.000
So what do we do?

08:12.916 --> 08:15.250
Well, we don't wanna surprise anyone.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.375
[doorbell rings]

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Don't we?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.000
[sighs]

08:40.833 --> 08:43.208
[Jen] It's not exactly
the stuff of nightmares.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.916
The Road changes for the coven.

08:46.791 --> 08:48.291
It changed us, too.

08:48.791 --> 08:49.791
My amulets.

08:50.750 --> 08:51.916
You still got 'em.

08:59.625 --> 09:04.041
It's giving "middle-aged second chance
at love" vibes and I'm here for it.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.208
[Alice] Definitely a sip-your-tea-
with-both-hands kinda place.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.708
I look like one of my customers.

09:18.833 --> 09:19.916
These don't open.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.083
[Mrs. Hart] Oh, my God!

09:24.208 --> 09:26.208
Bury me in that kitchen.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.250
Have you seen <i>Huge Tiny Lies?</i>

09:30.250 --> 09:32.541
[Lilia] It's <i>Huge Tiny Lies</i> everywhere.

09:33.291 --> 09:34.333
Check this out.

09:38.791 --> 09:41.750
What is this? A wedding?
Please God, not a baby shower.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.291
"The Witches' Road cordially invites you
to The First Trial."

09:49.083 --> 09:50.375
It's a riddle.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.333
"My age has value. I'm no fun alone.

09:53.333 --> 09:57.375
"I mess with your mind,
my tricks are well-known."

09:59.458 --> 10:01.208
That's a gorgeous card stock.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.541
Double-sided, too.

10:03.541 --> 10:04.791
What does it mean?

10:04.791 --> 10:07.208
That it's really expensive.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.250
"My age has value, no fun alone,

10:10.833 --> 10:13.000
"I mess with your mind,
my tricks are well-known..."

10:13.000 --> 10:15.666
- Sounds like a witch.
- Sounds like you.

10:15.666 --> 10:16.916
[mimics]

10:18.791 --> 10:19.958
Wine!

10:20.666 --> 10:23.958
That's it. Ten points for Mrs. Hart.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.041
Ten points for what now?

10:31.958 --> 10:34.041
Wait, we don't know what'll happen
if we drink it.

10:34.041 --> 10:36.541
Sure we do. Something terrible.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.958
But if we don't follow
these obvious breadcrumbs,

10:39.958 --> 10:42.291
we can't move forward
and we won't get to big prize,

10:42.291 --> 10:43.958
so does anybody have a corkscrew?

10:45.083 --> 10:46.541
- There's a built-in bar.
- Oh.

10:46.541 --> 10:48.000
And I will help you.

10:53.666 --> 10:55.833
Hey, a bit of advice.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.083
Yeah?

10:58.666 --> 11:00.083
Watch your back with Agatha.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.833
I know how people feel about her.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.916
Did you know she traded her own child
for the Book of the Damned?

11:11.625 --> 11:12.708
That can't be true.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.625
Nah. Yeah, you're probably right.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.666
But that is what people say.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.333
They say no one knows
what happened to him.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.083
They say he might be dead.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.750
Others say he might be a demon

11:27.750 --> 11:30.500
or an agent of Mephisto.

11:31.583 --> 11:35.041
But hey, that's what happens when you have
Agatha Harkness as your mom, right?

11:35.041 --> 11:38.250
I doubt she'd even recognize her own son
if he showed up at her doorstep.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.291
Oh, found it.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.875
[Agatha] Ooh, healthy pour.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.166
If you're waiting for charcuterie,
I don't think it's coming.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.583
Oh, okay. Wow.

12:10.875 --> 12:14.041
I have had a very hard day.
Do not judge me.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.708
[timer beeps]

12:28.500 --> 12:29.500
So...

12:31.208 --> 12:33.458
To harbingers of doom?

12:36.791 --> 12:38.208
To the prize.

12:42.791 --> 12:44.375
- Here we go.
- Can I have some?

12:44.375 --> 12:45.625
- No!
- You bet.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.500
Should we take the girl talk to the sofa?

13:21.416 --> 13:23.416
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.666
I really like your tattoo.
Where'd you get it?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.041
Nowhere.

13:29.875 --> 13:30.916
Okay.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.500
Got it in Colorado.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.583
My mom was playing Red Rocks.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.916
That symbol wards off curses, right?

13:49.375 --> 13:50.375
She, uh...

13:53.291 --> 13:54.291
made me get it,

13:55.833 --> 13:59.291
'cause she said all the women
in our family were cursed.

14:03.666 --> 14:04.666
She wasn't well.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.333
[Teen] How old were you?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.416
Thirteen, maybe.

14:15.666 --> 14:17.708
A lot happened to me at thirteen too.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.291
I miss your eyeliner.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.625
But the hair is cute.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.166
- [chuckles softly]
- [glass clinking]

14:27.166 --> 14:33.541
Okay, so a witch is really
just another name for a bad girl,

14:33.541 --> 14:34.625
is that right?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.833
That is extremely reductive.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.125
We are not a monolith.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.666
And, you know, I blame Halloween.

14:39.666 --> 14:41.291
Do you see any pointy hats in here?

14:41.291 --> 14:44.833
- [chuckles]
- Any green skin? Any brooms? No, sir.

14:44.833 --> 14:48.708
Well, I'm not saying
that I wanna join the club or anything,

14:48.708 --> 14:51.208
but I would drink the blood of a virgin

14:51.208 --> 14:53.625
if it would smooth out
some of these wrinkles.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.875
- [gasps] Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.166
Oh, you are so sweet.

15:01.791 --> 15:04.208
[chuckles] I don't really think
I need it, either.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.833
Okay, so, Mrs. Hart?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.958
- Sharon.
- [Alice] Sharon,

15:12.041 --> 15:15.208
you're a little swollen.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.916
Is it bad?

15:17.916 --> 15:19.583
I think she looks fantastic.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.250
- We've been poisoned.
- [Lilia] What?

15:22.833 --> 15:24.083
- No, no, no.
- [Jen] I need a mirror.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.375
- [Alice] Does my face look that bad?
- [Lilia] Let me see.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.541
Oh, my God! I have jowls!

15:30.125 --> 15:32.625
[gasps] My face!
My formerly perfect face!

15:32.625 --> 15:35.500
Honestly, I don't hate it.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.000
Oh, my God. Is that what I look like?

15:38.666 --> 15:40.541
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Hart.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.791
It's Sharon.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.916
You are so pretty.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.208
Thank you.

15:47.208 --> 15:50.208
But since you were the first to drink,
you're our canary in coal mine.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.500
Okay.

15:52.958 --> 15:56.208
- No, it's poisoned, Sharon. Remember?
- Why don't you just let her drink it all?

15:56.958 --> 15:57.958
Uh...

15:59.875 --> 16:02.875
It just serves our best interest is all.

16:02.875 --> 16:06.708
Okay. I'm gonna ask you a few questions
so we can try to identify the toxin, okay?

16:06.708 --> 16:08.916
Do you feel a tingling
in the back of your throat?

16:08.916 --> 16:11.416
- No.
- Do you taste mulberries?

16:11.416 --> 16:13.500
What do mulberries taste like?

16:13.500 --> 16:16.250
Do you hear any ringing
or the sound of fairies crying?

16:16.250 --> 16:18.916
- Huh?
- I love you, guys.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.625
What?

16:23.625 --> 16:24.958
[Mrs. Hart] I feel a little better.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.083
[Alice] Your face is back to normal.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.500
- Thank goodness.
- Is mine?

16:28.500 --> 16:30.083
- It's gone.
- [Agatha] Phew!

16:30.083 --> 16:32.000
- [Teen] It went away so fast.
- [Alice] Is that it?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.833
- [Mrs. Hart] Yay.
- Not "yay."

16:34.625 --> 16:35.750
Very much not "yay."

16:37.000 --> 16:38.166
What do you mean?

16:38.166 --> 16:40.541
The fact that the face swelling
decreased so quickly

16:40.541 --> 16:42.458
means it could be only one type of poison,

16:43.291 --> 16:44.500
Alewife's Revenge.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.625
Face swelling is just the beginning.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.875
Next is dizziness, delirium,
loss of motor function.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.208
My heart's racing.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.458
That's another one.

16:53.916 --> 16:56.583
Also, hallucinations, and eventually...

16:58.750 --> 16:59.958
Death.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.500
How do you spell "Alewife"?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.041
I've gotta get outta here.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.541
Agatha, what are you doing?

17:08.250 --> 17:09.625
- [Alice] Stop!
- [Teen] It'll break.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.208
- [Alice] She can't keep doing it!
- [Mrs. Hart] She's gone crazy.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.458
[roars]

17:13.458 --> 17:15.291
You can't run from the poison.

17:16.875 --> 17:20.041
She didn't drink the poison.
You can't cheat, Agatha.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.541
- Why? Who says?
- The Road.

17:22.541 --> 17:26.041
Oh, that's ridiculous!
We don't all have to suffer.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.375
Teen didn't drink.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.500
He's not in the coven. And he's underage!

17:29.500 --> 17:32.041
I'm gonna shove it down
your gullet, so help me...

17:32.041 --> 17:34.208
You know what? [grunts]

17:34.583 --> 17:35.750
- No!
- Yeah. Mmm!

17:35.750 --> 17:37.791
On the upholstery?

17:37.791 --> 17:38.875
We are wasting time!

17:38.875 --> 17:42.291
- You have to drink, Agatha.
- Well, I would, but there's no more wine.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.375
So...

17:52.000 --> 17:53.375
So cute.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.625
Drink.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.791
Fine. Then, I will.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.125
No!

18:10.125 --> 18:13.000
[scoffs] Ugh!

18:19.625 --> 18:23.708
[groans] Ugh! It's so cheap.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.625
Please, please.

18:27.208 --> 18:30.833
Wanda? Wanda, I'm begging you.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.583
Let him breathe. Please.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.833
[panting]

18:41.333 --> 18:43.125
So the hallucinations seem chill.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.125
[Agatha] Hey, Potions Witch.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.208
It's time to brew an antidote.

18:54.416 --> 18:55.458
[Jen] All right.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.208
Let's see what we're working with here.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.791
[exhales]

19:00.791 --> 19:04.833
I need frankincense
and the gut of a eusocial insect.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.625
- We'll handle that first part.
- Okay.

19:06.625 --> 19:09.583
I need a corpse that's been decaying
for at least 30 million years.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.166
Is that something that's available?

19:11.166 --> 19:13.125
'Cause I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.875
Why do I have to translate?
It's zooplankton.

19:15.875 --> 19:19.083
- It's in petroleum products.
- That we maybe can do.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.750
- [Agatha] Lilia, let's go.
- Okay.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.208
After you. Go. <i>Andale.</i>

19:23.708 --> 19:26.333
Okay, now I just need
a really big cauldron.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.541
That could work.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.041
No car. No gas.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.583
Okay, okay.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.500
Okay, I'm thinking petroleum...

19:43.750 --> 19:46.041
Jelly! Jelly.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.750
- [Lilia] We'll get it.
- [Agatha] How will we find it?

19:50.458 --> 19:53.333
Oh! Of course Jen's skincare
made it to The Road.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.916
But it's all organic, right?
I mean, there's no petroleum in there.

19:57.041 --> 20:00.583
Hmm. I know a snake oil salesman
when I see one.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.625
I say we call her bluff.

20:03.625 --> 20:04.625
Try to save Agatha.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.250
Uh... Uh...

20:08.250 --> 20:09.916
Yes, I love this plan.

20:09.916 --> 20:12.916
I just think we should find
the ingredients first, though, right?

20:13.375 --> 20:14.583
- Hmm.
- [Agatha chuckles nervously]

20:14.583 --> 20:15.875
- Right.
- All right.

20:15.875 --> 20:16.958
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.916
There's nothing of use in here.
Let's keep going.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.458
Wait.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.541
Is that eucalyptus?

20:33.708 --> 20:35.166
Essential oils.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.125
[shudders]

21:00.416 --> 21:01.750
[water running]

21:05.583 --> 21:06.583
[water stops]

21:07.250 --> 21:08.250
Eye of newt.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.041
Also known as mustard seed.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.708
[speaking Italian]

21:53.458 --> 21:54.458
[in English] Mom?

22:04.625 --> 22:09.833
You are an inconvenient woman.

22:37.416 --> 22:40.541
Mom? Are you really here?

22:44.083 --> 22:46.166
Your grandmother died today.

22:49.541 --> 22:54.333
Thousands of miles away, and I could
still feel it when it happened.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.625
It's my turn now.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.375
It's gonna kill me.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.833
[Alice] Don't say that.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.625
[breathes shakily]

23:27.166 --> 23:28.166
And now,

23:29.208 --> 23:30.416
you're nothing.

23:33.333 --> 23:36.708
[screams] I can't protect you!

23:39.625 --> 23:40.750
[gasps]

23:46.208 --> 23:48.083
[breathing heavily]

23:48.083 --> 23:49.583
[screams]

23:49.583 --> 23:51.375
[speaking Sicilian]

23:58.250 --> 23:59.416
[in English] Okay.

24:01.791 --> 24:03.166
- [gasping and panting]
- [Teen] Alice.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.458
I found the frankincense.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.625
- Let's go back to the kitchen.
- Yeah.

24:17.833 --> 24:18.833
You okay?

24:19.666 --> 24:20.708
No.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
Are you?

24:24.208 --> 24:25.458
Definitely not.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.958
We got the frankincense.

24:27.958 --> 24:30.875
Did you check the pantry
for the gut of a eusocial insect?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.125
Yeah.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.208
That's just a gross term
for honey, isn't it?

24:36.916 --> 24:37.916
Yeah.

24:37.916 --> 24:42.041
[groans] Okay, we've got ours,
what's next?

24:42.041 --> 24:43.583
[glass cracking steadily]

24:46.333 --> 24:47.333
What is that?

24:55.541 --> 24:56.625
Is that...

24:58.250 --> 24:59.250
Salt water.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.250
Are we underwater right now?

25:01.916 --> 25:03.666
How long is that gonna hold?

25:04.208 --> 25:05.708
And what happens when it breaks?

25:07.916 --> 25:09.083
No, thank you.

25:09.958 --> 25:11.958
- All right.
- [Agatha] Get those pears outta the way.

25:11.958 --> 25:13.375
Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.125
- [Alice] Come on, Jen.
- [Lilia] So nicely.

25:15.125 --> 25:16.291
Hurry up, hurry up.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.583
Okay.

25:19.958 --> 25:22.958
The elements need to be added
in a certain order,

25:22.958 --> 25:26.500
in a specific time,
starting with guts and eye.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Okay.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.458
All right. Next is frankincense.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.250
No, no, no. No, wait. Get outta here.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.041
Where's the zooplankton?

25:35.041 --> 25:36.500
- Ooh.
- Here.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.750
[Agatha] All natural or not, Jen?

25:39.750 --> 25:41.208
- Drop it in.
- I knew it.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.750
- [Alice] Right now?
- Obviously. Yes, three drops.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.791
- Okay.
- Take your time.

25:47.791 --> 25:49.583
- Oh, my God.
- Let me help you.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.291
One, two, three.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.625
- It's working. It's working, right?
- Okay.

25:59.916 --> 26:01.791
- Huh.
- What? What's wrong?

26:02.291 --> 26:04.708
Any bright ideas
on how to set this sink to boil?

26:04.708 --> 26:06.208
You didn't think of this before?

26:06.208 --> 26:09.375
In the middle of a traumatic
hallucination? No, Agatha, I did not!

26:10.458 --> 26:12.916
- Is there a sous vide?
- Oh, brilliant.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.208
That's something people know about?

26:15.208 --> 26:16.750
[Teen] It's a super fancy cooking tool.

26:16.750 --> 26:20.250
It heats water to a specific temperature,
so you can cook your meat evenly.

26:20.250 --> 26:22.500
- My dad loves his.
- Ah, cute.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.625
- Teen!
- Yeah.

26:25.041 --> 26:28.833
I need you to stir
with your dominant hand, counterclockwise.

26:30.041 --> 26:31.208
- To the left.
- Right.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.291
Everyone, pull a strand
of hair outta your head now.

26:34.291 --> 26:37.125
A single hair only. Everybody, hurry up.
[voices fade]

26:37.125 --> 26:38.583
[baby crying and fussing]

27:14.541 --> 27:15.541
[gasps]

27:16.583 --> 27:18.416
[whimpers]

27:20.125 --> 27:21.166
[Jen] Agatha!

27:26.458 --> 27:27.458
What did you see?

27:31.291 --> 27:32.291
Nothing.

27:32.291 --> 27:34.625
Agatha, we need your hair.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.416
Okay, wait.

27:41.208 --> 27:42.291
Now.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.416
- Stop stirring.
- [Alice] Okay.

27:44.833 --> 27:46.625
- We need to clasp hands...
- Okay.

27:46.625 --> 27:47.833
...and clear your minds.

27:48.416 --> 27:51.583
Once our intentions are aligned,
it will glow bright cerulean.

27:52.166 --> 27:55.666
- Yeah. What're our intentions again?
- To not die.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.708
I get cerulean and chartreuse confused.

28:02.708 --> 28:04.125
Is cerulean the green one?

28:04.125 --> 28:06.666
- No, it's blue.
- Then it's not workin'.

28:08.833 --> 28:12.125
It's like a blue-green, maybe like a teal?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.958
- It's green, Teen.
- Something is wrong.

28:14.958 --> 28:17.500
- I must have forgot something.
- One minute left.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.208
- What did you forget?
- I don't know!

28:19.208 --> 28:22.500
I've never made this potion before!
I make retinol serums, for Christ's sake!

28:22.500 --> 28:25.000
- Fifty seconds.
- There was a time where I would be able

28:25.000 --> 28:27.791
to just solve this
with a wave of my hand, but now?

28:27.791 --> 28:29.333
I'm bound.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.875
He stole my magic.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.416
- We're all going to die here.
- No.

28:33.416 --> 28:35.291
I do not wanna die here.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.208
[yells] This is not where I die.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
[panting]

28:39.750 --> 28:41.500
I have always hated you.

28:42.083 --> 28:43.250
If this is a pep talk...

28:43.250 --> 28:45.166
But I left you alone

28:45.166 --> 28:47.458
because what you were doing was important.

28:48.458 --> 28:51.958
Not this Kale Kare crap, the real work.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.708
You can be that witch again.

28:55.125 --> 28:58.083
They can take your power, Jen,

28:58.750 --> 29:00.875
but they can't take your knowledge.

29:03.583 --> 29:04.583
Jen?

29:05.458 --> 29:06.458
Blood.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.583
Whose and how much?

29:08.583 --> 29:10.541
We need the blood of the unpoisoned.

29:14.041 --> 29:15.041
[Alice] Thirty seconds.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.375
- Thanks for being underage.
- [Lilia] Agatha!

29:24.750 --> 29:26.000
[Jen] Not yet, not yet.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Now!

29:43.625 --> 29:46.000
[all chuckle in relief]

29:46.000 --> 29:47.333
Oh, my God.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.625
- [Jen] The timer's still ticking.
- Mrs. Hart!

29:56.291 --> 29:57.791
Take it. Take it.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.291
- Pass, pass.
- [Alice] Here, here.

29:59.416 --> 30:00.666
- God!
- [Jen] You can do it.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.291
- Is she awake?
- [Jen] Drink. Lift her head.

30:02.291 --> 30:04.583
- Careful not to spill it.
- [Agatha] Dump it in her mouth.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.083
- [timer beeping]
- [Alice] Oh...

30:08.708 --> 30:09.958
Did it work?

30:09.958 --> 30:11.750
- [clanging]
- [all gasp]

30:19.208 --> 30:20.458
Is that our exit?

30:22.750 --> 30:24.958
I am not climbing in an oven.

30:25.833 --> 30:28.208
That happened to a friend of mine,
she had a lovely house,

30:28.208 --> 30:29.416
and she ended up...

30:30.208 --> 30:31.208
[all screaming]

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Move it.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.500
Okay.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.791
Nope. Nope.

30:40.375 --> 30:41.583
Help me with her!

30:41.583 --> 30:42.875
Not a chance.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.291
We don't know what happens
if we leave her behind.

30:45.416 --> 30:47.000
[scoffs] Fine!

30:48.916 --> 30:50.666
- I'll grab her feet.
- [Alice] Get her to her back.

30:50.666 --> 30:52.083
Support her head. Now, lift.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.250
[Agatha] God, she's so little,
why is she so heavy?

30:54.833 --> 30:55.916
[Jen] We got it, we got it.

30:55.916 --> 30:59.083
[Agatha] Just shove her in there.
Just shove her, shove her in there.

31:00.958 --> 31:02.000
- You next!
- Okay, okay.

31:05.166 --> 31:06.625
All right. Me next!

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
[exclaims]

31:16.333 --> 31:17.875
[screams]

31:19.666 --> 31:20.916
[coughs]

31:21.250 --> 31:22.916
[all screaming]

31:49.458 --> 31:50.666
A little rusty there, Jen?

31:51.291 --> 31:53.083
- A little traitorous there, Agatha?
- [Lilia] Stop.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.250
We're alive.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.875
We made it through the first test.

31:58.916 --> 32:00.416
Everyone is safe.

32:00.416 --> 32:01.625
[Teen] Not everyone.

32:03.625 --> 32:04.791
Sharon's dead.

32:17.416 --> 32:18.541
Who's Sharon?
