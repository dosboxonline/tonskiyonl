01:32.780 --> 01:33.811
Welcome.

01:33.948 --> 01:36.190
Dr Atherton, I presume.

01:36.326 --> 01:39.279
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- We're in a hurry, Mr Manley.

01:39.411 --> 01:43.326
Leave your personal things. Just bring
your equipment. We depart immediately.

01:43.457 --> 01:46.244
Miguel Higueras, our field assistant.

01:46.376 --> 01:49.627
Sorry I'm late. I've been held up in
Caracas for a while with a fever.

01:49.755 --> 01:51.463
Tell the truth, I'm not over it yet.

01:51.590 --> 01:53.547
Be sick on your own time, Mr Manley.

01:54.802 --> 01:56.545
I want close-ups of every specimen

01:56.678 --> 01:59.595
<i>and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and tepuis.</i>

01:59.723 --> 02:00.637
The what?

02:00.766 --> 02:03.387
<i>Tepui. It's an Indian
word for mountain.</i>

02:03.518 --> 02:07.219
A place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years.

02:07.356 --> 02:09.098
Any man-eating dinosaurs?

02:09.232 --> 02:13.776
Atherton, you're in luck.
We're hitting a brand-new one today.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.813
Great. Anybody ever get lost?

02:15.947 --> 02:19.399
Legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return,

02:19.534 --> 02:23.662
but don't worry, we small-game hunters
don't climb, we fly!

02:49.439 --> 02:50.470
He friendly?

02:50.606 --> 02:53.523
I hope so. He's our guide.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.560
Stick close.

03:24.514 --> 03:26.258
Twenty-four hour ant.

03:26.976 --> 03:28.007
They bite?

03:28.143 --> 03:31.761
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.

03:32.272 --> 03:34.312
So do some of the frogs.

03:34.441 --> 03:35.721
Don't touch any.

03:36.985 --> 03:38.528
Great.

03:58.798 --> 04:03.793
This is where we're going.
We land here, then walk down here.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.209
This is a sinkhole.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.181
A place where thousands of years
of streaming water

04:08.307 --> 04:10.099
have torn away the rock.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.207
It's very deep. 2,000 feet.

04:43.341 --> 04:46.094
And dark at the bottom.
We'll need flash equipment.

05:08.032 --> 05:09.277
<i>Stegolepis.</i>

05:09.408 --> 05:12.445
Edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.121
Thanks, I'll pass.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.705
Plants your specialty?

05:15.831 --> 05:18.833
Insects and spiders
and identifying new ones.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.412
Great. Just what the world needs.
More bugs.

05:27.092 --> 05:29.762
What's your speciality, Manley?

05:31.097 --> 05:32.472
Football.

06:09.301 --> 06:12.800
Let's forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs,

06:12.930 --> 06:14.838
but a 2,000-foot drop? Come on!

06:14.973 --> 06:17.215
This is for the equipment.

06:17.351 --> 06:19.924
Our guide will show us another way down.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.165
What's with him?

06:48.298 --> 06:50.420
This is as far as he'll go.

06:51.926 --> 06:53.420
What?

07:26.335 --> 07:27.497
It's amazing.

07:27.628 --> 07:30.913
The air temp's dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters.

07:31.048 --> 07:32.506
Not far.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.008
Down there.

08:04.831 --> 08:06.289
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:06.415 --> 08:08.325
I'm fine, I just...

08:12.755 --> 08:14.084
What'd he say?

08:14.841 --> 08:18.339
He says you should be careful.
You're too big for us to carry out.

08:55.713 --> 08:57.920
Wait up!

09:28.663 --> 09:30.323
What does that thing do, anyway?

09:30.456 --> 09:33.991
Did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond?

09:34.127 --> 09:35.751
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?

09:35.878 --> 09:38.250
What happened?

09:38.380 --> 09:40.706
All sorts of stuff floated to the surface.

09:40.842 --> 09:42.300
Exactly.

09:42.426 --> 09:44.086
Everybody ready?

10:17.461 --> 10:19.168
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

10:21.047 --> 10:22.376
For what?

10:40.317 --> 10:42.143
For pictures, Manley, pictures.

10:59.252 --> 11:01.043
What is it?

11:01.170 --> 11:04.087
I think it's a new species of butterfly.

11:04.214 --> 11:07.132
<i>We could call it... photius manlii.</i>

11:20.897 --> 11:22.226
Extraordinary.

11:22.357 --> 11:24.397
Look at these markings.

11:25.736 --> 11:27.645
Don't just sit there.

11:27.779 --> 11:29.488
Are you sure it's dead?

11:29.615 --> 11:31.737
Yes, quite dead.

11:42.294 --> 11:43.207
Two more.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.878
This is highly unusual.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.792
So many spiders this size
in such a confined area.

11:47.925 --> 11:50.000
Look at the shape of the abdomen.

11:50.135 --> 11:52.542
We must try to find a live specimen.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.519
- What do you think you're doing?
- It was alive.

12:04.649 --> 12:06.393
Don't be ridiculous.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.353
It's just a spider. What's the big deal?

12:08.486 --> 12:10.478
It isn't just a spider.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.523
It was potentially a new species of spider.

12:12.657 --> 12:15.657
Isolated and unchanged
for millions of years.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.611
And all you could do is squash it.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.498
That's impossible. They should be dead.

12:28.630 --> 12:30.208
Very aggressive.

12:30.341 --> 12:32.962
We'll take two back alive and preserve two.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.651
Are you sure that'll do it?

12:56.783 --> 12:58.906
This stuff will kill an elephant.

12:59.536 --> 13:01.861
Millions of years, then we come along.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.539
How long's it gonna take us
to get back to camp?

13:08.670 --> 13:11.706
What's the matter?
You still worried about dinosaurs?

13:13.049 --> 13:14.876
This place just gives me the creeps.

13:24.852 --> 13:26.430
Incredible.

13:26.563 --> 13:27.594
What is?

13:27.730 --> 13:30.850
These spiders have
no reproductive organs.

13:30.983 --> 13:33.771
Almost like worker bees or soldier ants.

13:37.574 --> 13:41.784
Yeah, well, if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general.

13:41.911 --> 13:43.488
How are you feeling?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.112
Like hell. This fever's killing me.

13:46.248 --> 13:49.533
You don't look so good. Take a rest.

16:00.213 --> 16:02.004
The fever.

16:06.052 --> 16:09.421
Make sure we've got
all his film, Higueras.

16:09.555 --> 16:11.050
Have we notified his family?

16:11.182 --> 16:13.175
I contacted the American consulate.

16:14.393 --> 16:16.101
Okay, seal him up.

17:56.202 --> 17:59.784
I really wish you wouldn't
complain about my driving.

17:59.913 --> 18:00.863
Ready?

18:00.998 --> 18:03.156
You're pushing it. That's all I got to say.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.999
Take it easy, wait.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.051
Can you give me a hand here?

18:26.231 --> 18:28.223
I think I'll go move the hearse.

18:44.708 --> 18:49.915
Dick, I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.379
I know that we already decided
on an open casket,

18:53.507 --> 18:56.841
but we should maybe reconsider.

18:58.304 --> 19:03.049
Because I'm not sure
how they work down in South America,

19:03.184 --> 19:07.395
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours.

19:08.231 --> 19:12.808
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide,

19:12.943 --> 19:17.320
but in this already difficult time,
I'm not sure I could do that.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.696
No, you do have the option of...

19:20.826 --> 19:23.661
We could put a photograph
on top of the casket.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.488
No, the one that you had
in the newspaper.

20:16.464 --> 20:18.670
Okay, kids, go stake out your rooms!

20:24.805 --> 20:27.094
Ross, smell that air!

20:33.313 --> 20:34.477
Let's just...

20:34.690 --> 20:37.263
Before we discover what valuables
broke in the move,

20:37.401 --> 20:39.440
and that the breakfront doesn't fit,

20:39.569 --> 20:43.188
let's just chant twice:

20:43.323 --> 20:45.280
"We did the right thing."

20:47.536 --> 20:50.027
- For the kids.
- For us. For all of us.

20:51.289 --> 20:53.366
- Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.
- Right.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.706
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends.

21:00.340 --> 21:03.175
Dad, there's a dead bird over here!

21:04.678 --> 21:06.386
Don't touch it.

21:06.513 --> 21:08.920
Just go on into the house
and find your sister.

21:13.269 --> 21:15.226
Ross, the entire town is yours.

21:15.354 --> 21:18.558
You're the doctor.
Can there be a more respected figure?

21:18.692 --> 21:22.903
Respect is fine, but actually
I've always wanted to be feared.

21:23.029 --> 21:26.065
Easy with that.

21:26.199 --> 21:28.737
You don't want to agitate the sediments.

21:29.369 --> 21:32.156
ChÃ¢teau Margaux. $127 a bottle.

21:33.789 --> 21:35.829
Tasty, huh?

21:35.959 --> 21:38.366
At that price, who can afford to drink it?

21:38.502 --> 21:40.660
Goes in the basement.

21:43.216 --> 21:45.042
I mean the cellar.

21:47.428 --> 21:49.171
The wine cellar.

21:55.352 --> 21:58.685
I gotta get a big padlock.
Protect my investment.

21:58.814 --> 22:00.606
Dad!

22:01.275 --> 22:04.275
- What's wrong?
- Behind one of the boxes, a spider.

22:05.238 --> 22:06.945
It came at me, it was ugly.

22:07.072 --> 22:09.230
- Bigger than this.
- Okay, calm down.

22:09.366 --> 22:11.774
You're in the country now, okay?

22:11.911 --> 22:14.199
Come on, let's go find that spider.

22:14.329 --> 22:17.413
And let's find your mom
to take care of that spider.

22:17.541 --> 22:21.325
Honey, we're in the living room.
We need you to kill a spider.

22:21.461 --> 22:23.453
All right. Where is it?

22:23.589 --> 22:25.131
Over there, on the box.

22:25.257 --> 22:26.799
Killing a spider, cool!

22:26.925 --> 22:29.380
It's bad luck to kill a
spider in a new house.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.385
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

22:32.305 --> 22:35.010
Okay. Everything's okay.

22:40.063 --> 22:41.521
Poor thing.

22:41.647 --> 22:44.055
It's more scared of us than we are of it.

22:44.192 --> 22:46.599
Let's give it a home in the barn.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.112
Good idea, Shell.

23:05.546 --> 23:08.630
Mom, how come you're not
afraid of bugs like Dad is?

23:08.758 --> 23:11.675
I'm not afraid of all bugs. Just...

23:11.802 --> 23:14.340
- Be careful of rusty nails.
- Chill out.

23:14.472 --> 23:16.630
How about right here?

23:27.192 --> 23:30.193
You sure you won't miss
being in the thick of things?

23:30.779 --> 23:35.571
With all those stars and those crickets
singing, we are in the thick of things.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.536
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.

23:38.662 --> 23:43.657
Christmas bonuses, office politics,
caffeine, adrenaline,

23:43.792 --> 23:45.785
steady income...

23:46.753 --> 23:48.377
We'll be fine.

23:48.504 --> 23:53.332
Between my severance and all your
potential patients, we'll be fine.

23:54.427 --> 23:56.919
When are you meeting with Dr Metcalf?

23:57.055 --> 23:58.217
Thursday morning.

23:58.348 --> 24:01.468
The old coot passes me the torch
at 10.00 sharp.

24:05.938 --> 24:07.266
Wait.

24:07.899 --> 24:10.188
We can unpack in the morning.

24:10.902 --> 24:13.571
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement.

24:14.364 --> 24:15.739
Sorry, cellar.

24:15.865 --> 24:18.438
Ross, I'm exhausted.

24:18.576 --> 24:22.241
It's bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house.

24:22.371 --> 24:24.992
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

24:54.152 --> 24:59.360
I have terrific news. At least, I
think, for my patients it's terrific.

24:59.491 --> 25:01.946
Though my wife is less than thrilled.

25:02.076 --> 25:03.821
What's that, Dr Metcalf?

25:03.954 --> 25:06.112
I've decided to postpone retirement.

25:07.082 --> 25:09.122
I don't know for how long, but...

25:10.544 --> 25:11.788
But?

25:11.920 --> 25:15.254
But when I thought really hard about it,
I realised,

25:15.382 --> 25:18.466
there's only one thing left
to do when you retire,

25:18.593 --> 25:21.464
and I've seen too many friends
do that very thing

25:21.596 --> 25:24.881
just six months, a year
after they gave up their professions.

25:25.016 --> 25:26.510
But you...

25:28.395 --> 25:32.557
When we spoke just four months ago,
you assured me that...

25:32.690 --> 25:34.730
I'm not ready to retire, doctor.

25:34.859 --> 25:39.070
And if my wife can't rush me into it,
you sure as hell can't either.

25:57.172 --> 25:58.169
Excuse me.

25:58.299 --> 26:01.252
You gotta feed the meter, partner.

26:01.969 --> 26:04.009
Yeah, well, I was just leaving.

26:04.138 --> 26:06.130
A little late, though.

26:07.891 --> 26:09.765
I do have medical plates.

26:13.105 --> 26:16.355
Oh, right. You're that new doctor.

26:16.483 --> 26:19.152
- Ross Jennings.
- Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.649
You're a Yale grad, I heard.

26:21.779 --> 26:23.405
That's right.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.109
Well, it's just a school, isn't it?

26:28.245 --> 26:29.787
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.

26:29.913 --> 26:33.281
A young doctor comes to Canaima
and you write him a parking ticket?

26:33.416 --> 26:36.536
- What are you doing, Ms Hollins?
- What the whole town ought to do.

26:36.670 --> 26:38.496
Your ticker tape parade.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.623
- Thank you.
- That's littering.

26:40.757 --> 26:42.666
Lloyd's been a bully since the 5th grade.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.674
I ought to know, I held him back.

26:44.802 --> 26:46.545
Walk me to my automobile.

26:50.892 --> 26:52.849
Thank you for the swift intervention.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.433
- How did you know who I was?
- We're neighbours.

26:55.563 --> 26:58.480
I gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived.

27:00.026 --> 27:04.153
Between you and me, Sam Metcalf
only recently gave up leeches.

27:04.279 --> 27:07.067
He also recently gave up retirement.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.524
We moved from San Francisco
with the understanding

27:09.660 --> 27:13.492
that I would inherit all of his patients,
but now I have none.

27:13.622 --> 27:17.073
No, Dr Jennings, you have one.

27:22.381 --> 27:24.588
Honey, look at this light.

27:24.717 --> 27:28.216
On the best day in the city,
we didn't get light like this.

27:28.345 --> 27:30.137
Maybe they'll give me a show in town.

27:30.264 --> 27:33.134
Don't they do that in little towns?
In the town hall?

27:33.266 --> 27:35.758
"Molly Jennings, a retrospective."

27:35.895 --> 27:38.765
Of course, I'll need to
take some pictures first.

27:38.897 --> 27:42.101
There's good news and there's bad news.

27:42.234 --> 27:45.768
Should we go in reverse-alphabetical
order and start with the good?

27:47.781 --> 27:50.568
I'm seeing my first patient this afternoon.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.155
She's a great old dame,
she lives just up the road.

27:53.286 --> 27:55.493
Terrific. What's the bad news?

27:55.622 --> 27:58.195
She's my only patient.

27:58.916 --> 28:00.032
Today?

28:05.631 --> 28:07.708
Metcalf changed his mind.

28:08.343 --> 28:10.549
- What?
- Yeah.

28:10.678 --> 28:12.755
He panicked, is what it is.

28:12.889 --> 28:14.928
He decided that if he retires

28:15.058 --> 28:20.218
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something.

28:20.355 --> 28:21.896
But he told you.

28:22.023 --> 28:24.264
We looked in 14 towns,
we bought a house,

28:24.400 --> 28:26.274
you rented an office.

28:26.402 --> 28:28.229
What are we going to do?

28:29.238 --> 28:31.065
Kill him?

28:32.742 --> 28:36.027
I have my fax machine.
I can work part-time from here.

28:36.161 --> 28:40.325
A phone and a fax, that's all I need.
I'll call my old clients.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.209
- Even with half my commissions...
- We're gonna be fine.

28:43.336 --> 28:45.375
- Just like you said.
- With one patient?

28:45.504 --> 28:49.965
Maybe I'll get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease.

28:50.092 --> 28:52.464
Kind of like having seven patients in one.

28:58.392 --> 29:00.300
Fit as a fiddle.

29:00.810 --> 29:02.554
Not a damn thing wrong with you.

29:02.688 --> 29:04.846
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.

29:04.981 --> 29:09.359
What do you mean? Do you think I was
hoping you were ravaged by disease?

29:09.486 --> 29:11.774
What about my high blood pressure?

29:13.782 --> 29:16.107
You have above-normal systolic pressure,

29:16.242 --> 29:18.698
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.

29:18.828 --> 29:21.865
And yours is well below a level
that requires treatment.

29:22.957 --> 29:24.748
Do I need these?

29:25.877 --> 29:27.502
No.

29:27.629 --> 29:31.542
See, there's a difference between
the two types of hypertension.

29:31.674 --> 29:32.873
And in my opinion...

29:33.009 --> 29:38.170
In my opinion, Dr Metcalf doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

29:38.306 --> 29:40.879
But Canaima folks,
they're comfortable with him.

29:41.017 --> 29:43.139
They weren't always, though.

29:43.269 --> 29:47.397
When he first hit town just after the war,
everyone was terribly standoffish.

29:47.523 --> 29:51.106
- How'd he overcome that?
- He threw a party, invited the whole town.

29:51.235 --> 29:55.019
If Sam Metcalf were half as good
at medicine

29:55.155 --> 29:59.698
as he is at public relations,
he could run for the next surgeon general.

30:01.245 --> 30:04.495
That's it. Next month,
when the afternoons are cooler

30:04.623 --> 30:06.781
we'll throw you a party.

30:08.210 --> 30:09.918
Thanks.

31:37.756 --> 31:40.674
So, your one patient,
is she a walking health hazard?

31:40.801 --> 31:43.089
I couldn't even find a wart on her.

31:43.804 --> 31:45.760
Great, so what do we do?

31:47.391 --> 31:50.308
Enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in San Francisco,

31:50.435 --> 31:52.393
we no longer have to
refer to this as pasta.

31:52.521 --> 31:55.557
- Skinny spaghetti.
- Daddy's not done.

31:55.690 --> 31:56.853
On the bright side,

31:56.983 --> 32:00.851
Margaret, my tragically healthy patient,

32:00.987 --> 32:03.656
has offered to throw us
a "Get to know Dr Jennings" party.

32:03.781 --> 32:04.731
Daddy's not done.

32:07.077 --> 32:09.318
One cup of punch
with the handsome new GP

32:09.453 --> 32:13.451
and the good people of Canaima will see
the light and abandon old Doc Metcalf.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.120
- It's a nice gesture.
- Yeah.

32:16.252 --> 32:17.663
Can we go play with Bunny?

32:17.796 --> 32:20.369
Yeah, I want you both in
before dark, though.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.962
Bunny Beechwood.
She popped over this morning.

32:25.094 --> 32:26.968
A neighbour. Seems nice.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.635
What do you bet they're gonna
go chase fireflies or something?

32:32.309 --> 32:34.930
- Wanna blow up a bullfrog?
- Okay!

32:36.564 --> 32:38.805
I got some great shots in the barn today.

32:40.067 --> 32:43.566
If the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do...

32:43.696 --> 32:45.355
The web?

32:46.990 --> 32:50.241
Yeah, our little spider
made himself a hell of a home.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.073
I think even you would appreciate it.

32:53.204 --> 32:56.159
Molly... how can I make this more clear?

32:57.501 --> 33:00.075
- I have...
- A terrible fear of spiders.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.881
I'm aware, I've seen what happens.

33:03.006 --> 33:07.253
Which is why I think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.714
Look at the web?

33:08.845 --> 33:13.258
Yes, and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.016
Therapy, Ross.

33:15.143 --> 33:16.720
We live in the country now.

33:16.853 --> 33:20.685
It's time to work through
this irrational, paralysing terror.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.107
- It's not irrational.
- I know.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.144
The incident.

33:25.278 --> 33:26.986
It's like it happened yesterday.

33:27.113 --> 33:30.149
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.868
It's my first memory.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.788
I can envision the crib,

33:36.915 --> 33:39.452
all around me, clear as day.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.576
I can still feel the feeling of waking up.

33:41.710 --> 33:45.127
Just drowsy, peaceful, secure,
then there it was.

33:45.256 --> 33:48.625
- Probably just a daddy longlegs.
- It seemed huge.

33:48.760 --> 33:53.884
It just came relentlessly,
crawling through the bars of the crib.

33:54.014 --> 33:57.300
- As it touched my bare leg...
- I know, you were just wearing a diaper.

33:57.435 --> 34:00.601
All my limbs involuntarily froze.

34:00.729 --> 34:02.473
You were probably still half-asleep.

34:02.606 --> 34:05.311
I was paralysed, Molly.
I still get paralysed.

34:05.442 --> 34:07.566
Try to understand how this makes me feel.

34:07.695 --> 34:12.735
I was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin.

34:14.076 --> 34:17.445
I can still feel its hairy
little legs just...

34:18.330 --> 34:19.908
Then up to my face.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.998
It's the feeling of utter helplessness.

34:23.126 --> 34:26.745
Being explored by an alien thing,
that's all.

34:30.884 --> 34:34.051
Can you blame me
for being a spider-phobe?

34:34.971 --> 34:36.844
Arachnophobe.

34:36.973 --> 34:38.598
Whatever.

34:44.147 --> 34:46.638
You see it up there,
right beyond the ladder.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.284
Impressive, huh?

35:19.264 --> 35:20.890
Therapy, right?

35:21.017 --> 35:22.427
Right.

35:41.536 --> 35:43.030
Oh, God.

35:44.957 --> 35:48.491
There, you see?
You still have full use of all your limbs.

35:54.758 --> 35:57.166
Have you seen it up here?

35:57.970 --> 36:00.887
I think you spared the eight-legged
Frank Lloyd Wright.

36:11.649 --> 36:13.440
Are you okay? Honey, it's okay!

36:13.568 --> 36:15.275
What the hell was that?

36:15.654 --> 36:16.602
It's...

36:18.489 --> 36:19.948
Come on.

36:29.709 --> 36:30.823
Jesus!

36:31.794 --> 36:34.250
Hold me!

36:36.299 --> 36:38.125
Oh, my God!

36:53.983 --> 36:57.018
<i>@ From across the sea</i>

37:19.216 --> 37:21.007
How are you finding life here?

37:21.134 --> 37:24.835
After a few initial shocks,
we're slowly adjusting, I think.

37:24.971 --> 37:27.343
I've been checking on you, Ross.

37:27.473 --> 37:31.174
Henry, when I'm finally ready
to throw in the towel,

37:31.311 --> 37:32.970
Dr Jennings is your man.

37:33.104 --> 37:35.595
- Henry Beechwood.
- Ross Jennings.

37:35.732 --> 37:39.350
- By all accounts, a fine physician.
- I'll remember that.

37:39.985 --> 37:42.062
This brings back memories.

37:42.489 --> 37:45.405
Right after the war,
when I moved to Canaima,

37:45.533 --> 37:47.740
the whole town threw me a party.

37:47.869 --> 37:49.577
You threw yourself a party.

37:49.704 --> 37:51.530
Now that was a party!

37:51.664 --> 37:54.036
Now that is a jerk!

38:25.489 --> 38:27.730
- Canaima welcomes you.
- Thank you.

38:27.866 --> 38:30.073
Listen, I was interested in something.

38:30.202 --> 38:32.278
I wonder if you could
give me a little help.

38:32.412 --> 38:35.531
Do you think
that I should have this removed?

38:35.665 --> 38:37.824
What's Bunny showing them over there?

38:37.959 --> 38:40.960
Hand-to-hand combat techniques.

38:42.339 --> 38:46.550
So Becky, have you thought about
what you'll major in at college?

38:46.676 --> 38:47.755
Gym.

38:47.885 --> 38:50.459
It's in the genes.

38:50.597 --> 38:53.514
Bobby here,
he's the Broncos' star quarterback.

38:55.018 --> 38:58.600
I taught him to throw a football
before he could walk.

38:58.729 --> 39:00.271
I coach the team.

39:00.397 --> 39:02.023
Nepotism, huh?

39:02.150 --> 39:04.023
Actually, we're Baptists.

39:06.320 --> 39:09.072
Nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says,

39:09.198 --> 39:11.771
"Irv, you think I might be dead?"

39:11.909 --> 39:14.116
Must drive you nuts
trying to dip your Dorito

39:14.245 --> 39:16.818
while somebody's showing you his growth.

39:16.956 --> 39:18.913
How do you handle it?

39:19.042 --> 39:24.283
I just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker.

39:25.339 --> 39:28.256
Say, what do you think about that...

39:28.384 --> 39:31.967
- Why shouldn't I have another?
- Because you've had too much already.

39:32.096 --> 39:34.088
- Let's go.
- No, I'm thirsty.

39:34.223 --> 39:36.345
That's the Manleys.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.883
Their son recently passed away.

39:39.019 --> 39:40.478
That's awful. How?

39:40.604 --> 39:42.643
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.267
Photographer.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.606
He was on a scientific
expedition down in...

39:46.735 --> 39:48.478
Venezuela.

39:49.613 --> 39:52.234
Nobody'd tell me how.

39:52.365 --> 39:55.782
- Or even let me see him to say goodbye.
- Let's go.

40:04.085 --> 40:08.130
I had to recommend a closed coffin.

40:08.256 --> 40:10.712
His body looked all chewed up.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.668
Drained.

40:12.802 --> 40:18.009
Like some vampire had had a go at him.
It was terrible.

40:21.227 --> 40:23.018
Excuse us.

40:28.317 --> 40:32.778
I'll be you made enough friends today
to break Sam Metcalf's death-grip.

40:32.906 --> 40:35.396
It was wonderful.
We can't thank you enough.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.027
Nor I you.

40:37.159 --> 40:39.781
Freeing me from those damn pills.

40:39.912 --> 40:43.197
I feel I could compete in a triathlon.

40:43.332 --> 40:46.167
On the basis of your check-up,
I tend to agree.

40:46.293 --> 40:48.286
- Bye-bye, Margaret.
- Bye, Molly.

40:50.965 --> 40:55.211
Irv, Claire. Would you like a doggy bag?

40:55.344 --> 40:58.464
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!

41:48.855 --> 41:50.977
Come on, honey. Party's over.

41:58.865 --> 42:01.900
Happy hunting, Felix.
See you in the morning.

42:35.275 --> 42:39.059
You'd have had too much punch
and been the life of the party.

42:47.079 --> 42:49.118
I missed you.

43:47.679 --> 43:48.711
Ross!

43:56.521 --> 44:01.563
I could have killed one of you.
The nails came straight...

44:02.611 --> 44:04.021
It's all rotten down there.

44:04.154 --> 44:07.986
My wine cellar is...
It's probably crawling with termites.

44:08.742 --> 44:11.197
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor.

44:11.327 --> 44:13.653
I'll call the exterminator.

44:18.084 --> 44:21.535
You're rather casual
about the death of my dream.

44:21.671 --> 44:24.422
I've been trying to reach Margaret
to thank her

44:24.548 --> 44:26.340
and her line's been busy all morning.

44:26.467 --> 44:28.839
She's probably gabbing.

44:29.428 --> 44:31.256
- You want me to...
- Would you?

44:31.389 --> 44:33.381
I'll go over and check on her.

44:57.956 --> 44:59.534
Margaret?

45:10.260 --> 45:12.003
So what do you think, doc?

45:12.137 --> 45:13.881
Heart attack.

45:14.014 --> 45:16.719
Bound to happen, rather sooner than later.

45:16.850 --> 45:19.935
She had a history of high blood pressure.

45:20.062 --> 45:22.731
- Even with the pills I put her on...
- I took her off those.

45:22.856 --> 45:25.097
What right did you have to do that?

45:25.233 --> 45:27.060
She came to me. As a patient.

45:27.194 --> 45:29.400
You didn't notice she was hypertensive?

45:29.529 --> 45:31.901
Her diastolic reading was normal.

45:32.032 --> 45:34.439
Her systolic elevation was below 160.

45:34.576 --> 45:38.075
- If you'd stayed current...
- This is a very serious matter, young man.

45:41.374 --> 45:45.668
- You may well have killed this woman.
- I don't think so. She was in fine shape.

45:45.795 --> 45:47.752
- I want an autopsy.
- Never.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.339
Look, she was my patient.

45:49.465 --> 45:51.257
And mine for 40 years.

45:51.801 --> 45:56.012
Margaret wouldn't want to be butchered.
And nobody here would want that for her.

45:56.138 --> 45:58.012
Give it to me, Irv.

45:58.141 --> 46:00.299
I'm satisfied if you're satisfied, doc.

46:00.434 --> 46:04.432
You come from a big city
where people don't care about each other.

46:04.563 --> 46:06.971
I don't expect you'd understand.

46:08.150 --> 46:09.775
A little advice.

46:09.902 --> 46:12.025
If you're ever going to fit in in Canaima,

46:12.154 --> 46:14.776
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here.

46:14.907 --> 46:18.489
I'm sorry I'm more interested
in medicine than public relations!

46:18.619 --> 46:22.367
You know, cardiac victims
don't usually bite their tongues off.

46:22.498 --> 46:25.249
It's as though she went
into titanic convulsions.

46:25.375 --> 46:28.376
Until I know why, this case isn't closed.

46:28.921 --> 46:32.870
You're damn right it's not. I believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice.

46:33.007 --> 46:35.925
And I intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion.

46:46.104 --> 46:50.516
Ross, I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.

46:50.650 --> 46:52.892
Why don't you come by the gym
tomorrow at 3.00?

46:53.028 --> 46:54.605
It's a mile up the road from you.

46:54.737 --> 46:56.564
I'll throw some business your way.

46:56.697 --> 46:58.441
Thank you, Henry.

46:58.575 --> 47:00.318
I appreciate that.

47:01.244 --> 47:03.153
That was nice of him.

47:04.414 --> 47:06.702
Think he could have said
it a little louder?

47:23.182 --> 47:25.755
A little young, isn't it?

47:25.893 --> 47:27.221
The wine?

47:28.521 --> 47:31.972
No, Margaret. To die at 68.

47:35.403 --> 47:41.108
That's ten years below the life expectancy
of a Caucasian female. Did you know that?

47:43.243 --> 47:45.236
Ross, you're a fine doctor.

47:45.370 --> 47:49.582
I'm sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills.

47:49.708 --> 47:52.626
Like I knew what I was doing
when I chose this town?

47:52.753 --> 47:55.588
With the country doctor from hell.

47:55.714 --> 48:00.542
Or this fine house,
which is rotting from the ground up.

48:00.677 --> 48:03.168
I'm gonna take care of that in the morning.

48:03.304 --> 48:06.555
Well, Margaret's still
gonna be dead in the morning.

48:10.603 --> 48:12.845
I still want to know what killed her.

48:30.456 --> 48:35.082
He was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated.

48:35.210 --> 48:36.705
Termites, huh?

48:36.838 --> 48:38.877
That's what my husband thought.

48:39.006 --> 48:43.419
- And he's an expert in these matters?
- Well... no.

48:43.553 --> 48:45.675
Didn't think so.

48:45.804 --> 48:48.213
I'm glad you called me.

48:51.060 --> 48:53.728
No room for amateurs in this game.

49:13.332 --> 49:15.289
Thank you.

49:20.881 --> 49:22.209
What is it?

49:22.340 --> 49:24.583
It's hard to say.

49:24.718 --> 49:27.802
Would anybody object
if I tore this floor out?

49:27.929 --> 49:30.384
- I would.
- False alarm, then. Lead on.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.808
How bad is it?

49:37.981 --> 49:39.854
I didn't find a thing. Go figure.

49:39.983 --> 49:42.735
Then why is all the wood rotting?

49:42.861 --> 49:44.652
I'll tell you why.

49:45.988 --> 49:47.732
Bad wood.

49:47.865 --> 49:49.942
So... what do we do?

49:50.994 --> 49:53.282
Tear out bad wood.

49:53.412 --> 49:55.204
Put in good wood.

49:57.125 --> 50:00.575
My husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar.

50:00.711 --> 50:03.119
I collect beer cans myself.

50:03.256 --> 50:06.754
I got a rare '74 of Miller Lite
with a misprint on the label.

50:06.884 --> 50:10.087
Only a hundred or so cans in circulation.

50:10.221 --> 50:12.462
The husband just might want to
take a gander.

50:12.597 --> 50:14.638
No hard shoes on the court.

50:15.726 --> 50:16.639
Sorry.

50:16.769 --> 50:20.304
Look, I know what a blow
losing Margaret was for you.

50:20.439 --> 50:23.938
People keep score.
You're only as good as your last game.

50:24.067 --> 50:27.104
- Hell, I ought to know.
- I appreciate your concern, Henry.

50:27.237 --> 50:29.064
I want you to enjoy Canaima.

50:29.197 --> 50:30.940
Clean water, fresh air.

50:31.074 --> 50:33.862
Got no police sirens wailing all night.

50:33.994 --> 50:37.030
Just crickets.
We have crickets up the wazoo.

50:38.248 --> 50:42.625
Actually, I haven't heard any crickets
lately, now that you mention it.

50:42.752 --> 50:44.876
Actually, I haven't either.

50:45.005 --> 50:46.796
Okay, Broncos, the doc's here!

50:46.923 --> 50:48.999
Get ready to drop 'em.

50:50.093 --> 50:52.133
The doc wants to hear you cough.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.793
You call yourself Broncos?

51:33.928 --> 51:36.383
You look like a bunch of babies.
Come on!

51:51.779 --> 51:54.400
You're moving in slow motion here.

52:05.459 --> 52:09.076
That's supposed to be a banana out.
Looks like a banana split!

52:09.212 --> 52:10.872
- Shitty pass.
- I heard that!

52:11.006 --> 52:12.665
What are you, a garbage mouth?

52:12.799 --> 52:14.423
Hit the showers.

52:14.550 --> 52:16.211
Wash that mouth out. Miller!

52:17.721 --> 52:20.840
- You know the patterns?
- Like the back of my hand.

52:20.973 --> 52:24.971
Get in here. Run the same thing again.
Hurry up.

52:25.103 --> 52:28.306
Come on, Miller.
We're waiting on you, let's go!

52:28.440 --> 52:30.432
Come on! Move it! You wanna play?

52:30.566 --> 52:32.523
Come on, run. Let's go.

52:33.527 --> 52:34.903
Thanks.

52:35.655 --> 52:37.446
Run it.

52:50.961 --> 52:52.586
Up. Let's go.

52:57.384 --> 52:59.626
Miller, you all right?

52:59.762 --> 53:02.252
- Coach!
- What's wrong with Miller?

53:04.224 --> 53:06.016
Back up, let him breathe.

53:06.143 --> 53:08.219
What's wrong? What is it?

53:08.353 --> 53:10.144
Come on, give us some air.

53:12.399 --> 53:15.068
Let's get his helmet off.

53:15.193 --> 53:18.444
Real easy. Support his head, coach.

53:18.572 --> 53:20.611
Real gentle.

53:40.134 --> 53:43.550
From what I hear,
it wasn't a very hard tackle.

53:44.264 --> 53:46.635
I only wish I knew, you see

53:46.766 --> 53:49.601
Dr Jennings examined him last.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.233
Why so gloomy?

54:05.868 --> 54:10.197
Bunny Beechwood says that
everybody's calling you Dr Death.

54:11.498 --> 54:13.871
That's just silly, Shelley.

54:14.460 --> 54:17.544
And they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.747
Tom, look...

54:19.882 --> 54:21.542
It's called an autopsy.

54:22.134 --> 54:24.672
It's not a very pleasant thing,

54:24.804 --> 54:29.797
but sometimes it's the only way to find out
what really happened to a person.

54:29.933 --> 54:33.267
But some doctors who should know better
won't accept that.

54:34.020 --> 54:36.808
But some doctors who should know better
just won't accept

54:36.940 --> 54:40.107
that their big-city methods
don't sit well in a small town.

54:40.777 --> 54:44.989
Both Margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.736
It's a bit odd, don't you think, Sam?

54:47.867 --> 54:50.537
If I autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack

54:50.662 --> 54:53.615
I'd be run out of Canaima so fast...

54:53.748 --> 54:57.793
Poor Sam. You still think life is
a popularity contest.

54:59.795 --> 55:02.832
You're not jealous of
our new young doctor, are you?

55:02.966 --> 55:04.709
What?

55:04.842 --> 55:06.751
Now you made me lose my timing.

55:06.887 --> 55:08.546
You're yelling, Sam.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.716
Come on to bed.

55:14.519 --> 55:16.558
I need a shower.

55:16.687 --> 55:20.222
I'd love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you.

55:20.358 --> 55:22.813
It's not the same thing, Evelyn.

55:22.943 --> 55:25.233
I need to know exactly how far I've gone

55:26.197 --> 55:28.770
and exactly how long it took me.

55:28.908 --> 55:30.734
Floor's cold, Sam.

55:30.867 --> 55:33.904
You're right. You're always right.

55:39.752 --> 55:40.831
Damn!

55:41.545 --> 55:44.463
- What's wrong?
- Some damn thing bit me.

55:46.467 --> 55:49.087
It's just a spider.

55:49.219 --> 55:51.757
Spider? Felt like a damn cougar.

55:51.889 --> 55:53.169
Damn!

55:56.518 --> 55:58.096
I'm having a seizure.

55:58.228 --> 56:00.434
Sam, what should I do?

56:00.563 --> 56:02.806
Ambulance. Call Jennings.

56:09.865 --> 56:11.608
I'll be right there.

56:13.576 --> 56:16.696
- What's going on?
- Metcalf. He's having a seizure.

56:17.705 --> 56:20.113
<i>Thank God you didn't
examine him this morning.</i>

56:24.420 --> 56:27.790
- What's the coroner doing here?
- I don't know.

56:29.008 --> 56:30.965
Milt! This isn't necessary.

56:31.093 --> 56:33.217
I'll be the judge of that, Lloyd.

56:33.346 --> 56:35.137
Wait out here.

56:35.264 --> 56:38.467
Guard the house or something.

56:41.103 --> 56:43.559
Was he alive when you got here?

56:44.398 --> 56:47.483
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.

56:47.610 --> 56:50.100
Whatever it was, it was abrupt and acute.

56:51.155 --> 56:55.069
What's your guess? Massive coronary?
Cerebral haemorrhage?

56:55.200 --> 56:58.404
His wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized.

56:59.747 --> 57:01.703
Oh, right.

57:01.832 --> 57:04.121
Sam told me about you.

57:04.251 --> 57:07.785
You're the hot shot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.

57:08.964 --> 57:11.253
I'll accept it if I agree with it.

57:12.092 --> 57:13.254
Good.

57:13.385 --> 57:15.674
Let me show you something.

57:15.804 --> 57:17.464
Down here.

57:20.767 --> 57:22.760
I believe that's a spider bite.

57:25.313 --> 57:27.187
I'll buy that.

57:27.315 --> 57:29.225
But I rather doubt that's what killed him

57:29.359 --> 57:33.024
In twenty years,
I've seen only one spider-bite fatality.

57:33.154 --> 57:36.488
And that involved a black widow
and a one-year-old child.

57:36.616 --> 57:40.696
No. My guess is that
Sam overexerted himself.

57:40.829 --> 57:44.244
His wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over.

57:44.373 --> 57:46.830
You may be right.

57:47.877 --> 57:49.252
I want a full autopsy.

57:49.379 --> 57:52.546
Tissue samples, blood toxicology,
the whole nine yards.

57:52.674 --> 57:54.666
- Wait just one second.
- Shut up, Lloyd.

57:54.801 --> 57:57.587
- You'll get Evelyn's permission, of course.
- Of course.

57:57.720 --> 58:00.756
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

58:00.890 --> 58:04.342
You better take care of yourself now.
You're the town doctor.

58:04.936 --> 58:06.560
Say "Aahh."

58:09.356 --> 58:13.603
Okay, I think we're gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics.

58:15.904 --> 58:18.312
Does this mean
I don't get any ice cream?

58:18.449 --> 58:20.441
I'll buy you a double scoop
on the way home.

58:20.576 --> 58:22.402
Who's next?

58:22.536 --> 58:25.027
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

58:25.164 --> 58:27.239
Step right this way.

58:27.374 --> 58:29.533
Just have a seat. I'll be right with you.

58:34.798 --> 58:36.957
Okay, hot shot. Are you sitting down?

58:37.884 --> 58:41.420
According to preliminary data,
Sam Metcalf died as the result of

58:41.555 --> 58:46.512
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream.

58:47.311 --> 58:51.260
<i>My office isn't ruling out accidental
poisoning, deliberate poisoning</i>

58:51.397 --> 58:53.770
<i>or even killer spiders.</i>

58:53.900 --> 58:57.897
<i>At the moment,
it looks like a heart attack to me.</i>

58:58.029 --> 59:00.816
<i>But I'll support whatever
you'd like to do.</i>

59:00.949 --> 59:03.570
I gotta have those bodies exhumed.

59:03.701 --> 59:06.275
I gotta be sure.

59:06.413 --> 59:07.871
Okay.

59:08.623 --> 59:10.829
Whatever you think is necessary.

59:10.958 --> 59:12.121
Thanks.

59:12.252 --> 59:13.876
Are you out of your mind?

59:14.003 --> 59:16.292
Slowly and once more, Lloyd...

59:16.422 --> 59:20.087
I want Margaret Hollins'
and Todd Miller's bodies exhumed.

59:20.218 --> 59:21.961
Dug up.

59:25.139 --> 59:29.136
You start pulling citizens out of the
ground that should be enjoying eternal rest

59:29.268 --> 59:31.427
and that roomful of patients
will disappear...

59:31.562 --> 59:35.642
I'll just get a court order.
Milt Briggs is on my side.

59:38.527 --> 59:42.656
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale-graduate-big-city doctor!

59:42.782 --> 59:44.821
A very bad business!

59:44.950 --> 59:46.444
No shit!

59:58.296 --> 01:00:00.455
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:01.836
What's going on?

01:00:01.967 --> 01:00:04.967
I promised Shelley
she could spend the night with Bunny.

01:00:05.095 --> 01:00:07.337
We'll take good care of her.

01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:13.429
Wait.

01:00:14.438 --> 01:00:18.850
There may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous.

01:00:18.984 --> 01:00:21.356
Okay? I just want you girls
to be aware of this.

01:00:21.486 --> 01:00:25.235
If you should see one,
don't try to capture it or kill it.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.320
Just run, you understand?

01:00:31.871 --> 01:00:35.406
- Run!
- We'll do that, Dr Jennings.

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:38.246
You don't have to worry about anything.

01:00:38.378 --> 01:00:40.002
Dr Death!

01:00:44.175 --> 01:00:46.298
Are you all right?

01:00:46.427 --> 01:00:48.004
No.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.812
All clear.

01:01:07.614 --> 01:01:10.615
The spider didn't answer.
She had fallen asleep.

01:01:10.742 --> 01:01:14.194
It had been a very, very busy day.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.037
Okay, your turn, Bunny.

01:01:17.457 --> 01:01:20.743
The itsy bitsy spider

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:24.831
Crawled up the water spout

01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:29.626
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:35.051
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

01:01:35.183 --> 01:01:40.723
And the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again

01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:43.312
It's my turn now.

01:01:43.441 --> 01:01:45.932
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.310
Eating her curds and whey

01:01:48.446 --> 01:01:50.819
And along came a spider

01:01:50.949 --> 01:01:53.237
That sat down beside her

01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:55.159
And frightened Miss Muffet...

01:01:56.162 --> 01:01:59.745
If you girls don't settle down
then Shelley can't stay over any more.

01:01:59.874 --> 01:02:02.447
- We can't sleep.
- We keep scaring each other.

01:02:02.584 --> 01:02:05.076
Why don't you two
go sleep in my room for a while?

01:02:05.213 --> 01:02:07.668
Okay. Nah, we don't need this.

01:03:09.608 --> 01:03:11.898
Son of a bitch.

01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:17.825
Where are all the other crickets?

01:03:17.951 --> 01:03:19.990
Where are all your buddies?

01:03:50.274 --> 01:03:51.602
Atherton.

01:03:51.733 --> 01:03:53.726
Yes, Dr Atherton.

01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:56.188
I'm Ross Jennings.

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:58.859
I'm a general practitioner, and I...

01:03:58.991 --> 01:04:03.118
I have a problem
that may be spider-related.

01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:05.914
You seem to be the foremost authority
on the West Coast.

01:04:06.039 --> 01:04:08.744
Or any coast, for that matter.

01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:11.248
Dr Jennings, let me tell you that

01:04:11.378 --> 01:04:15.707
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare,

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.968
some unexplained outbreak,
and spiders make convenient culprits.

01:04:20.553 --> 01:04:23.258
<i>Did you know that on
every suburban acre</i>

01:04:23.389 --> 01:04:26.841
there are at least 50 to 60,000 spiders?

01:04:26.976 --> 01:04:31.188
And that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year?

01:04:32.065 --> 01:04:36.727
<i>That means at least 5 million insects
are consumed per acre annually.</i>

01:04:37.904 --> 01:04:39.896
Think about it, doctor.

01:04:40.031 --> 01:04:43.898
<i>Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders.</i>

01:04:44.035 --> 01:04:46.608
<i>Dr Atherton,
I have nothing against spiders.</i>

01:04:46.745 --> 01:04:48.988
<i>It's just we have had three deaths
in my town</i>

01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:51.412
<i>and I'm afraid
there's going to be some more.</i>

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:55.077
<i>If you could lend me your expertise,
forjust an afternoon...</i>

01:04:55.213 --> 01:04:58.663
We're really not that far from you.
It's a town called Canaima.

01:05:00.801 --> 01:05:02.130
<i>You know it?</i>

01:05:02.261 --> 01:05:04.170
It's familiar.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:07.801
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you exactly?

01:05:17.317 --> 01:05:19.690
Collins?

01:05:21.446 --> 01:05:23.688
- Sorry.
- Are you equally busy tomorrow?

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:47.381
Dr Atherton?

01:05:47.513 --> 01:05:50.052
No, I'm Chris Collins,
one of his assistants.

01:05:50.183 --> 01:05:52.852
Hi, I'm Chris.
Atherton's really busy lately.

01:05:52.977 --> 01:05:57.853
He's recently discovered a new species
of spider. Down in South America.

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.893
To us, it's a big deal.

01:06:02.612 --> 01:06:06.194
I hope you'll be able to help us.
We're going to be examining some bodies.

01:06:06.323 --> 01:06:08.815
It sounds like a blast.

01:06:09.827 --> 01:06:11.819
We're looking for bites.

01:06:14.165 --> 01:06:16.406
Like this. That's a spider, isn't it?

01:06:19.336 --> 01:06:20.961
I'm not sure.

01:06:21.088 --> 01:06:23.377
I think so.

01:06:23.507 --> 01:06:26.461
<i>But even at several times
the potency of latrodectus.</i>

01:06:27.636 --> 01:06:29.130
- Black widow, right?
- Right.

01:06:29.263 --> 01:06:31.753
Even then it would take
more than one bite to kill,

01:06:31.891 --> 01:06:36.967
so I figure this guy's death and the spider
bite, if it a spider bite, are coincidental.

01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:39.514
Hey, guys, how's it going?

01:06:40.774 --> 01:06:42.683
Poor Margaret.

01:06:42.817 --> 01:06:45.819
She was a good wife, good teacher,
good neighbour.

01:06:47.155 --> 01:06:48.697
Excellent cook.

01:06:48.823 --> 01:06:50.817
Anything you want, just shout.

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.829
I want some fresh air.

01:06:55.955 --> 01:06:58.328
Chris, come here.

01:07:03.839 --> 01:07:06.210
Still think it's a coincidence?

01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:09.257
That's a spider bite.

01:07:09.386 --> 01:07:11.674
The tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated.

01:07:11.804 --> 01:07:13.215
Found one.

01:07:13.347 --> 01:07:15.008
A mark behind the left ear.

01:07:21.231 --> 01:07:24.017
<i>- Atherton.
- Dr Atherton, Chris Collins.</i>

01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.516
<i>I think we've got a big problem
here in Canaima.</i>

01:07:26.652 --> 01:07:28.111
<i>They've got three dead bodies.</i>

01:07:28.237 --> 01:07:32.733
<i>The cause of death seems to be a spider
more deadly than any I've ever seen.</i>

01:07:32.866 --> 01:07:36.033
<i>They want the okay
to quarantine the town.</i>

01:07:36.162 --> 01:07:39.827
- Are you sure?
- This is way out of my league.

01:07:39.957 --> 01:07:43.408
I think you'd better come up here
right away.

01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:48.340
I can be there tomorrow afternoon.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:51.799
But Collins, try and find me a specimen.

01:09:16.926 --> 01:09:18.718
Did you bring the keys?

01:09:18.845 --> 01:09:20.008
Great.

01:09:20.138 --> 01:09:21.965
Perk up, Lloyd.

01:09:22.098 --> 01:09:25.100
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him.

01:09:37.613 --> 01:09:40.567
Milt, why don't you cover the living room?

01:09:42.202 --> 01:09:44.278
Chris, why don't you check out back?

01:09:45.955 --> 01:09:48.956
Lloyd, take the kitchen.

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:54.286
And I'll just... I'll oversee the...
I'll just coordinate the...

01:09:56.049 --> 01:09:57.591
I'll just stay right here.

01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:10.362
What is all that crap?

01:11:10.496 --> 01:11:13.581
Leftovers.
Mostly cricket parts, wings, legs.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.579
We haven't heard any crickets in Canaima
these past few weeks.

01:11:28.014 --> 01:11:29.721
Ross, here!

01:11:29.849 --> 01:11:31.129
Don't move!

01:11:32.352 --> 01:11:35.802
- It's dead. Shit!
- What could have killed it?

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:39.099
The shock of seeing Lloyd?

01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:49.947
There are other people in this house.

01:11:50.077 --> 01:11:51.986
Dad, go away!

01:11:55.332 --> 01:11:57.788
Use the one down here!

01:12:59.103 --> 01:13:01.142
Never a moment's peace.

01:13:03.941 --> 01:13:05.980
What happened? Are you all right?

01:13:15.953 --> 01:13:18.953
Why don't we just take the dead spider
and get out of here?

01:13:19.081 --> 01:13:22.995
You don't get off that easy. It's already
desiccated. It wouldn't be any use to us.

01:13:23.127 --> 01:13:24.953
You mean macerated.

01:13:25.087 --> 01:13:28.373
No, I mean desiccated.
Dried up, drained of all its blood.

01:13:28.507 --> 01:13:31.045
Macerated is the... chewing that they do.

01:13:34.263 --> 01:13:36.800
They're like little vampires.

01:13:36.932 --> 01:13:39.967
This trip of Atherton's to find
the spider species, where'd he go?

01:13:40.102 --> 01:13:42.343
South America.

01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:44.056
Venezuela, why?

01:13:50.028 --> 01:13:51.819
Is that one of them?

01:13:51.946 --> 01:13:53.856
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:07.080
Ross, you're going to have
to take a step towards it.

01:14:10.464 --> 01:14:13.880
- Chris, I'm scared to death.
- We all are.

01:14:14.009 --> 01:14:18.755
But our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them.

01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:22.056
I don't think I have
that particular neurotransmitter.

01:14:22.977 --> 01:14:24.257
Yes, you do.

01:14:50.879 --> 01:14:52.503
You need an asbestos glove.

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.204
Doomsday weapon in Delbert's war
on a creepy crawler.

01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:59.969
I coat it with Demon EC,
insecticide with environmental conscience.

01:15:00.097 --> 01:15:03.050
It's biodegradable. Organic.

01:15:03.183 --> 01:15:07.761
You ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff.

01:15:15.987 --> 01:15:17.778
Now, Delbert...

01:15:20.199 --> 01:15:24.150
There's a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed Sam Metcalf.

01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:26.659
Maybe Margaret, maybe even my Bronco.

01:15:27.832 --> 01:15:29.326
<i>Doubtful, Henry.</i>

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:34.377
In a case in Florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.

01:15:34.505 --> 01:15:36.961
Sustained over a dozen bites and lived.

01:15:42.722 --> 01:15:47.762
Of course, he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions.

01:15:47.893 --> 01:15:49.553
There's no spider here.

01:15:49.687 --> 01:15:52.640
But I will hunt down the alleged arachnid

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.350
<i>and spritz him to kingdom come.</i>

01:16:39.736 --> 01:16:41.894
Yeah, that's right.

01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:43.227
I'm bad.

01:16:52.415 --> 01:16:54.407
Dr Atherton, Ross Jennings.

01:16:56.544 --> 01:16:58.252
Come in.

01:16:58.713 --> 01:17:01.037
Did you find me another specimen?

01:17:01.173 --> 01:17:03.961
Yes, I did.
I also paid a call to the town mortician.

01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:07.179
Several months ago, there was a corpse.

01:17:07.304 --> 01:17:10.804
The body was desiccated,
it was totally drained of blood.

01:17:10.933 --> 01:17:12.972
Irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough

01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:17.016
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body...

01:17:17.147 --> 01:17:20.064
I think I know
why you've heard of Canaima.

01:17:20.776 --> 01:17:22.815
This was Jerry Manley's home town.

01:17:24.988 --> 01:17:26.981
- Manley the photographer?
- Yeah.

01:17:27.408 --> 01:17:31.618
I think one of your Venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in Manley's coffin.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:41.369
The fangs, the injectors,
are disproportionately large.

01:17:41.504 --> 01:17:43.829
Three poison sacs.

01:17:44.675 --> 01:17:46.632
Now, let's test the venom.

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:59.054
The nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite.

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:02.391
And, of course, the place
where the subject is bitten.

01:18:02.525 --> 01:18:05.443
It can lead to paralysis or death.

01:18:15.204 --> 01:18:19.202
I'm no expert, but I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:20.993
I'd agree.

01:18:27.717 --> 01:18:29.875
No sex organs.

01:18:30.761 --> 01:18:32.800
That would make them drones.

01:18:34.181 --> 01:18:36.090
Or soldiers.

01:18:36.809 --> 01:18:40.723
That's typically seen in highly organised
insect societies - bees, ants...

01:18:40.855 --> 01:18:44.057
but we've never seen it in spiders.

01:18:44.191 --> 01:18:46.682
- I have.
- Venezuela, right?

01:18:47.152 --> 01:18:49.441
Right. This is the descendant.

01:18:49.571 --> 01:18:53.403
Somehow that South American male
has mated with a domestic house spider

01:18:53.534 --> 01:18:55.822
and created a very deadly strain.

01:18:55.952 --> 01:18:58.823
But if it has no sex organs,
it can't reproduce, right?

01:18:58.956 --> 01:19:03.083
True, and the accelerated growth rate,
combined with the specialisation,

01:19:03.209 --> 01:19:05.748
suggests a short life cycle.

01:19:05.879 --> 01:19:08.167
We've already seen a dead one.

01:19:08.298 --> 01:19:12.378
- That could be the good news.
- Now let's discuss the bad.

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:14.004
In their own ecosystem,

01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:18.799
the species I discovered in South America
live at the top of the food chain.

01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:24.687
The spread out from a central nest in a
web-like pattern and dominate the area.

01:19:24.814 --> 01:19:29.725
But in their original habitat, geography
contains them. That isn't true here.

01:19:29.861 --> 01:19:33.312
So the original male's
the grandaddy of them all.

01:19:33.447 --> 01:19:37.694
And he's acting like a general
sending his troops to battle.

01:19:37.827 --> 01:19:39.285
Excuse me.

01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:42.362
Professor? This is our town exterminator.

01:19:42.498 --> 01:19:46.365
McClintock, infestation management.
Always nice to meet a colleague.

01:19:46.501 --> 01:19:50.250
He believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago.

01:19:50.381 --> 01:19:52.918
Might you have brought it with you?

01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:56.300
Actually, he's probably still
on the bottom of my shoe.

01:19:57.012 --> 01:20:00.428
You really can't tell what it is any more.

01:20:01.642 --> 01:20:05.806
In this first generation,
the original male also produced a queen.

01:20:05.938 --> 01:20:10.682
Together they will construct a primary
nest, which the queen will guard.

01:20:10.817 --> 01:20:14.815
But eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own.

01:20:14.946 --> 01:20:17.864
When that happens, this town is dead.

01:20:17.991 --> 01:20:22.035
And the next town, and the next town.
And the next one and so on.

01:20:22.162 --> 01:20:25.163
Irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated.

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:28.741
- If we go in and destroy the original male...
- And the primary nest.

01:20:28.876 --> 01:20:32.459
- I'll call the Department of Agriculture.
- There's phones in the office.

01:20:32.589 --> 01:20:36.918
- I'll see you later at the mortuary.
- Sheriff, you'll give me a ride.

01:20:37.052 --> 01:20:38.759
I am not a chauffeur.

01:20:38.886 --> 01:20:40.926
- Shut up.
- Damn, it's busy!

01:20:41.055 --> 01:20:44.471
<i>Irv and Blaire always take the phone off
the hook during Wheel Of Fortune.</i>

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.759
Let's get the hell over there.

01:21:08.082 --> 01:21:11.082
Blaire, real butter or fake butter?

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:12.669
Fake.

01:21:16.882 --> 01:21:20.049
- Irv, hurry.
- Buttery, hot and delicious!

01:21:37.486 --> 01:21:39.525
He needs to buy a vowel.

01:21:45.827 --> 01:21:47.784
Buy a vowel.

01:21:53.584 --> 01:21:55.209
Delbert!

01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:03.212
What's this nest?
What's it gonna look like?

01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:09.049
You'd know it if you found it.
The area would be dark, warm, moist.

01:22:09.976 --> 01:22:13.060
It'd be kind of a musty smell
and you'd probably see an egg sac.

01:22:13.187 --> 01:22:15.476
Like your basic egg sac.

01:22:15.606 --> 01:22:19.984
White, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.

01:22:21.279 --> 01:22:23.437
Of course, there'd be
no other spiders around.

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:25.150
What do you mean?

01:22:25.282 --> 01:22:30.407
Spiders are cannibals, so she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.

01:22:31.997 --> 01:22:36.873
Yes, tell them exactly what I've told you.
Even if it is interrupting a dinner party.

01:22:37.002 --> 01:22:38.545
Sheriff?

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:47.338
Where is this?

01:22:47.471 --> 01:22:50.175
It's the old Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.

01:22:50.306 --> 01:22:52.216
Take me there.

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.581
Hey, Irv!

01:23:17.876 --> 01:23:19.286
Ross.

01:23:20.294 --> 01:23:21.919
Canaima welcomes you.

01:23:22.047 --> 01:23:25.497
Irv, we have an emergency!

01:23:45.027 --> 01:23:46.735
I'll get us into the mortuary.

01:23:48.781 --> 01:23:50.405
Ross!

01:24:20.103 --> 01:24:21.894
We've found it.

01:24:25.942 --> 01:24:30.272
Please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator.

01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:32.896
All right, I'll do that.

01:24:33.032 --> 01:24:37.113
Meanwhile, just stay here, sir, because
I'm not going to be responsible for...

01:24:37.245 --> 01:24:38.655
Fine.

01:24:53.011 --> 01:24:56.593
The killings have been so arbitrary.
Maybe there's more than one nest.

01:24:56.722 --> 01:24:58.300
No, there's just that one.

01:24:58.432 --> 01:24:59.843
What was it Atherton said?

01:24:59.976 --> 01:25:02.929
They radiate out from a central nest.
You got a map of this town?

01:25:03.062 --> 01:25:06.099
- Thinking about buying here?
- Just get a map, please.

01:25:07.066 --> 01:25:08.228
Here.

01:25:08.359 --> 01:25:10.600
The Kendalls' house.

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:13.025
Mark that down on there.

01:25:13.155 --> 01:25:14.566
All-righty.

01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:16.821
And the old guy, the doctor.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:18.493
Metcalf.

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:21.110
- The football kid?
- Died behind the high school.

01:25:21.246 --> 01:25:25.161
Right here. This is fun.
I found one at Beechwood's.

01:25:25.292 --> 01:25:27.617
- The old lady, what was her name?
- Margaret.

01:25:27.753 --> 01:25:30.042
- Is that all of them?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:25:30.172 --> 01:25:32.663
This here in the centre,
that's the mortuary, right?

01:25:32.799 --> 01:25:35.836
- No, that's a house.
- Who the hell lives there?

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:38.095
I do.

01:25:45.228 --> 01:25:48.432
The whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn!

01:25:48.565 --> 01:25:50.024
I doubt that, doc.

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:53.814
Your basic spider'd find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year.

01:25:53.945 --> 01:25:56.863
In that respect, spiders are
a bit like you and me.

01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:59.278
I frankly doubt the nest is in the barn.

01:25:59.408 --> 01:26:00.951
I frankly know it is.

01:26:01.077 --> 01:26:02.702
I was in the barn. I saw a web.

01:26:02.829 --> 01:26:04.702
There's a web in the barn.

01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:07.322
A web would indicate
an arachnoid presence.

01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:11.538
They got a saying,
I believe it's in the Benelux countries...

01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:15.087
Just drive, Delbert.
Just drive and get us there, please.

01:26:34.526 --> 01:26:37.196
My, you've been busy!

01:26:37.321 --> 01:26:38.815
Incredible.

01:27:06.766 --> 01:27:09.258
Supper's ready.

01:27:09.394 --> 01:27:10.639
Come and get it.

01:27:26.411 --> 01:27:29.779
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy whatever's in the barn.

01:27:29.914 --> 01:27:33.200
Check. Better uncork my private stock.

01:27:33.334 --> 01:27:37.711
- Chris, there may be spiders in the house.
- They're probably... All right, let's go.

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:47.971
Give me a minute to look around out here and
then we go in, nice and easy, all right?

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.559
Hel-lo!

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.279
Trick or treat.

01:28:16.251 --> 01:28:17.626
Gotcha!

01:28:22.299 --> 01:28:24.624
Let's see what we got up here.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.523
Oh, my God. They got the professor.

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:50.146
Honey?

01:28:50.284 --> 01:28:52.361
- We're in here, Ross.
- Hi, Dad.

01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:04.879
I expected you home for dinner.
I got worried, I called the office.

01:29:05.007 --> 01:29:07.463
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:22.483
Okay, everyb...

01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:39.406
Everybody just get up very slowly.

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:50.000
And walk towards the door.

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.678
Okay, quick and quiet.

01:29:56.808 --> 01:29:59.097
We're gonna need another way out of here.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.856
Upstairs, up into the bathroom.
We can climb out onto the roof.

01:30:10.237 --> 01:30:12.147
Watch yourself, Ross.

01:30:14.158 --> 01:30:15.700
Come on, Shelley.

01:30:21.999 --> 01:30:22.864
Come on.

01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:25.663
This doesn't make sense.
They're swarming.

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:28.250
I've never seen them this aggressive.

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.208
Hi, you guys, I'm Chris.

01:30:34.094 --> 01:30:36.420
Put that under the door, quick!

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:44.845
Get it off me!

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:49.725
- Come on, Shelley.
- One at a time.

01:30:52.946 --> 01:30:54.904
Down the trellis, honey.

01:30:56.658 --> 01:30:58.650
Get out of there.

01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:06.914
Ross, get out of there.

01:31:11.881 --> 01:31:14.170
- Where's Ross?
- Right behind me.

01:31:14.301 --> 01:31:15.581
Oh, no!

01:31:21.099 --> 01:31:22.641
Shit!

01:31:25.312 --> 01:31:27.304
Mom, spiders!

01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:29.181
Shelley, Tommy, come here quick!

01:31:29.315 --> 01:31:31.889
- Kids, come on.
- Get 'em away from the house.

01:31:39.575 --> 01:31:41.614
Rock 'n' roll.

01:31:44.247 --> 01:31:46.405
All right, it's party time.

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:52.496
Take that!

01:32:55.733 --> 01:33:00.608
What is it?
Musty smell, moist, dark, no spiders.

01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:03.360
There's no spiders.

01:33:04.408 --> 01:33:07.444
It's dark, musty. The nest!

01:33:10.331 --> 01:33:12.157
Nest. The queen.

01:33:15.419 --> 01:33:17.875
Shit, I'm in the goddamn nest!

01:33:19.548 --> 01:33:21.874
Help!

01:33:26.429 --> 01:33:28.008
Chris!

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:29.967
I found the nest!

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.388
And I saw the queen!

01:33:34.605 --> 01:33:36.099
Shit!

01:34:32.369 --> 01:34:34.197
Come on.

01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:02.849
Therapy.

01:35:12.284 --> 01:35:14.110
That's your basic egg sac.

01:35:26.923 --> 01:35:28.582
Be right back.

01:36:24.772 --> 01:36:27.974
Where is it?
That was the goddamn general!

01:36:30.486 --> 01:36:32.442
Help!

01:37:16.989 --> 01:37:19.112
Not the ChÃ¢teau.

01:38:39.987 --> 01:38:42.276
Goddamn it, where are you?

01:38:43.073 --> 01:38:44.865
Damn it!

01:39:06.596 --> 01:39:11.804
The itsy bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

01:39:11.935 --> 01:39:16.893
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:25.522
Come on, come on.

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.545
Shit!

01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:32.773
Nice shot.

01:41:35.575 --> 01:41:37.153
Thank God.

01:41:39.371 --> 01:41:40.829
Don't mention it.

01:41:56.221 --> 01:41:58.509
It's okay. Everything's okay.

01:41:59.682 --> 01:42:02.256
- Oh, God, the spider...
- It's okay.

01:42:02.394 --> 01:42:05.429
Most of them are dead.
The ones Delbert didn't get are dying.

01:42:05.563 --> 01:42:08.932
- Where are the kids?
- The kids are fine. Everybody's okay.

01:42:19.619 --> 01:42:26.120
<i>@ I left my heart</i>

01:42:28.335 --> 01:42:32.914
<i>@ In San Francisco</i>

01:42:37.303 --> 01:42:39.509
<i>@ High on a hill</i>

01:42:40.556 --> 01:42:43.261
You know what I'll miss most
about the country?

01:42:43.392 --> 01:42:46.428
- What?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

01:42:48.313 --> 01:42:50.390
At least we got out with our lives.

01:42:50.524 --> 01:42:51.983
Yes.

01:42:53.652 --> 01:42:55.728
And the Margaux.

01:42:57.823 --> 01:43:00.859
To office politics, Christmas bonuses,

01:43:00.992 --> 01:43:03.235
caffeine, adrenaline.

01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:07.118
To things that we know,
to events that we can control.

01:43:07.248 --> 01:43:08.791
To...

01:43:20.178 --> 01:43:22.669
- Okay, that was a minor tremor.
- I barely felt it.

01:43:22.806 --> 01:43:25.047
Probably wouldn't even show up
on that scale.

01:43:25.183 --> 01:43:26.559
Richter scale.

01:43:26.685 --> 01:43:28.891
Just a cable car going by.

01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.475
We should check the kids.
