WEBVTT

00:55.354 --> 00:56.719
You screwed up!

00:56.789 --> 00:59.485
Here we go, here we go!

00:59.558 --> 01:01.583
Yeah! All right!

01:11.570 --> 01:13.231
Got him.

01:13.305 --> 01:15.330
Target is in sight.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.240
Clock him close.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.539
<i>He's not going anywhere.</i>

01:24.682 --> 01:27.480
I'm hand-carrying this thing
right into the museum.

01:27.552 --> 01:29.884
Stan, you've got more cover on you
than the president.

01:29.954 --> 01:31.387
The diamond is safe.

01:31.456 --> 01:36.155
This is an armed caravan,
completely bulletproof, magnetic locks.

01:36.227 --> 01:38.491
- This transfer is under control.
- I'm hot.

01:39.631 --> 01:41.758
<i>FBI Travel Link climate control.</i>

01:41.833 --> 01:43.266
<i>I don't understand your command.</i>

01:43.435 --> 01:45.300
<i>I don't understand your command.</i>

01:45.370 --> 01:48.168
<i>I don't under... I don't... I don't...
I don't under... I don't understand...</i>

01:48.239 --> 01:50.002
It's too damn complicated.

01:57.415 --> 01:58.746
- That way.
- That's some bullshit!

01:58.817 --> 02:01.081
Are you kidding me, ref?
That's the Lakers' ball.

02:01.152 --> 02:03.245
My blind grandmother
coulda seen that!

02:03.321 --> 02:04.811
- Sit down, fat boy!
- That's the Lakers' ball!

02:04.889 --> 02:06.117
I'm callin' it!

02:09.561 --> 02:10.585
What are you doing?

02:10.662 --> 02:14.029
Green light go,
red light stop, buddy.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.995
No, no, no. No, sir.

02:17.068 --> 02:19.127
Thank you, thank you.
Okay, great.

02:19.204 --> 02:21.728
Nice job. Bye-bye.

02:22.239 --> 02:24.230
- Tip him. Get him outta here.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:33.750 --> 02:34.774
Jesus.

02:34.852 --> 02:36.786
No, come on, that's enough.

02:36.854 --> 02:38.116
Okay, thank you.

02:38.856 --> 02:41.051
Go take a bath.
There you go.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.490
Let's roll.

03:02.613 --> 03:04.604
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Every time!

03:04.681 --> 03:06.012
Charge? Charge!

03:06.083 --> 03:09.246
Ref, listen!
This is insane!

03:09.319 --> 03:10.513
It's a foul on him.

03:10.587 --> 03:12.646
Charge? I'll show you a charge!

03:12.723 --> 03:15.487
I'll show you a damn charge, man!

03:15.559 --> 03:17.788
That's the worst call I ever seen!

03:17.860 --> 03:19.657
What do you think this is, a rodeo?

03:19.729 --> 03:21.094
Then I'll be the clown!

03:21.164 --> 03:22.597
- Let me in the game!
- Sit down, please.

03:22.665 --> 03:24.758
Get out of my way!
Play some real ball!

03:24.834 --> 03:26.324
Unleash the Beast!

03:26.402 --> 03:27.892
Hey, put Malone in there!

03:27.970 --> 03:29.733
Put in the Mailman, damn it!

03:29.805 --> 03:31.602
Get Shaq in the game!

03:31.674 --> 03:34.234
You gotta win this game!
You gotta win this game!

03:34.310 --> 03:36.904
Don't take me,
I'm an American citizen!

03:36.979 --> 03:38.913
American citizen, damn it!

03:41.050 --> 03:42.278
You sons of bitches!

03:42.351 --> 03:43.375
I'm the clown!

03:43.452 --> 03:46.751
The Lakers need me!
I'm their clown!

03:46.822 --> 03:48.153
Shit! He's gone.

03:48.758 --> 03:49.986
We've lost him.

03:50.059 --> 03:51.117
What?

03:51.194 --> 03:53.287
<i>- Burdett is gone.
- Find him.</i>

03:54.964 --> 03:56.693
He's coming after it.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.563
We're fine.
Just relax.

03:58.634 --> 04:00.602
Don't tell me to relax.

04:00.670 --> 04:03.104
I've dealt with this guy before.

04:15.717 --> 04:17.048
See him yet?

04:18.553 --> 04:20.521
We're looking, we're looking.

04:22.157 --> 04:24.318
Safeties off until they relocate Burdett.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.958
<i>Oh. Kiss me</i>

04:28.029 --> 04:29.428
Stand down. We got him.

04:29.497 --> 04:31.488
He's still here.

04:31.566 --> 04:32.931
On the Jumbotron.

04:33.001 --> 04:34.229
He changed his seat.

04:37.272 --> 04:38.967
Get a direct visual.

04:39.841 --> 04:41.001
You got it.

05:01.329 --> 05:03.229
See, Stan, we got you here.

05:03.298 --> 05:05.129
No need to panic.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.608
Do you have a direct visual yet?

05:16.677 --> 05:18.702
<i>Negative. We're still looking.</i>

05:25.352 --> 05:26.910
We're clear?

05:29.023 --> 05:30.081
We're clear.

05:30.157 --> 05:31.181
Come on out.

05:37.564 --> 05:38.724
What?

05:43.604 --> 05:45.765
That thing is going by itself! Damn!

05:48.375 --> 05:49.967
Come on!

06:07.994 --> 06:09.586
Jesus!

06:09.662 --> 06:11.254
Transfer has been compromised.

06:46.766 --> 06:48.631
What's going on?!

07:07.052 --> 07:08.849
Hey!

07:14.960 --> 07:16.018
No!

07:32.010 --> 07:33.068
Thank the guys.

07:33.145 --> 07:34.442
Good luck.

07:44.489 --> 07:46.548
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Your beard tickles.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.722
Did he tip you?

07:52.798 --> 07:55.266
- One lousy buck.
- Cheap bastard.

07:57.701 --> 07:59.328
I love it when you undress.

07:59.403 --> 08:01.030
Let's do this.

08:21.559 --> 08:22.856
Turn that shit off!

08:35.905 --> 08:37.840
What about Mexico?

08:37.908 --> 08:39.398
Can't take the water.

08:40.211 --> 08:41.438
How about Paris?

08:41.511 --> 08:42.945
Can't take the French.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.078
Promise me paradise.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.448
Can we talk about this
after we gas Agent Lloyd?

08:50.721 --> 08:51.779
Sure.

09:31.361 --> 09:32.385
A few... Aah!

09:33.363 --> 09:34.352
M ax

09:38.268 --> 09:40.498
Max Max

09:42.705 --> 09:43.729
Look at me.

09:43.907 --> 09:45.568
Look at me.

09:45.642 --> 09:47.337
Don't worry.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.274
Get the diamond.

09:57.352 --> 09:58.376
Stan.

10:01.456 --> 10:02.855
Are you all right?

10:19.107 --> 10:23.009
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

10:23.078 --> 10:24.875
Turn around and let me see you

10:24.947 --> 10:26.244
Turn around and let me see

10:26.315 --> 10:30.308
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

10:30.385 --> 10:31.852
Turn around and let me see you

10:31.920 --> 10:33.444
Turn around and let me see

10:33.522 --> 10:36.548
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

10:36.625 --> 10:39.924
I got a new dance,
hot like pepper

10:39.995 --> 10:43.624
From the old to the young,
gonna make your body rock

10:43.699 --> 10:46.997
It's really easy, easy peasy

10:47.068 --> 10:50.765
You can do it anywhere,
jump around like you don't care

10:50.838 --> 10:52.965
Singin' turn around and let me see you

10:53.140 --> 10:54.437
Turn around and let me see

10:54.508 --> 10:58.638
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

10:58.713 --> 11:01.546
Turn around and let me see you,
turn around and let me see

11:01.616 --> 11:05.245
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

11:05.319 --> 11:07.048
A young man broke his leg

11:07.121 --> 11:08.850
Old granny broke her back

11:08.923 --> 11:12.120
And Jimmy got a migraine
from a falling coconut

11:12.193 --> 11:15.754
Dead uncle was confused,
he has a solution

11:15.830 --> 11:19.197
A bottle of the apple wine
was his prescription

11:19.266 --> 11:22.292
It cure the broke leg,
it cure the bad back

11:22.370 --> 11:26.534
It cure the migraine,
even cure the heart attack

11:26.607 --> 11:29.906
The people started jumping
'cause they were feelin' fine

11:29.977 --> 11:33.708
This city's greatest sin
was their own fine wine, tell me

11:33.781 --> 11:35.408
Turn around and let me see you

11:35.483 --> 11:36.882
Turn around and let me see

11:36.951 --> 11:40.977
Your own pineapple wine,
your dollar fifty all the time

11:41.054 --> 11:42.544
Turn around and let me see you...

11:42.622 --> 11:44.089
I wrote my vows.

11:44.157 --> 11:46.284
- What?
- I wrote my vows.

11:46.359 --> 11:49.351
- You?
- Work in progress.

11:55.468 --> 11:57.026
Max, this is Ron and, uh...

11:57.103 --> 11:58.263
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Gail.

11:58.338 --> 11:59.635
- Gail, yes.
- Great to run into you again.

11:59.706 --> 12:01.469
- I met them at the tennis club.
- Oh.

12:01.541 --> 12:02.940
What kind of business you in, Maxwell?

12:03.009 --> 12:04.943
Pest control.

12:06.012 --> 12:07.604
- This is Sheila and Ed.
- Hey!

12:07.681 --> 12:09.012
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:09.082 --> 12:10.447
They're from Orlando.

12:10.517 --> 12:12.212
I met them parasailing.

12:12.285 --> 12:14.810
So, uh, what kind
of business are you in, Max?

12:14.888 --> 12:17.448
I have a bunch of sweatshops
in the Philippines.

12:18.858 --> 12:21.326
You should see those kids
make those hats.

12:21.394 --> 12:23.259
- Great, huh?
- Wow.

12:23.329 --> 12:25.456
- Scootch in.
- Hi.

12:25.532 --> 12:26.897
Max, this is Wendell and June.

12:26.966 --> 12:28.593
We met snorkeling.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.135
- Max, right?
- Yes.

12:30.203 --> 12:31.568
Yeah, Wendell.

12:31.638 --> 12:34.573
- Oh, I love lobster.
- Oh, yummy!

12:34.641 --> 12:36.733
Wow, look at that!

12:38.544 --> 12:41.172
Stocks may rise and fall,
economies may collapse,

12:41.246 --> 12:43.840
but the American farmer's always
gonna need manure.

12:43.916 --> 12:47.079
My family's been in manure
for three generations.

12:47.152 --> 12:48.449
No shit.

12:49.588 --> 12:51.215
Holy cow!

12:53.158 --> 12:54.682
Sheila and I like to swoc.

12:55.327 --> 12:56.419
Swoc?

12:56.495 --> 12:59.020
We like to have sex
with other couples.

12:59.898 --> 13:00.990
Check.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.294
Ooh, honey, look at that!

13:04.369 --> 13:05.597
Something wrong?

13:05.671 --> 13:09.163
Six months.
I can't take any more lobster.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.402
There's only one thing
I enjoy eating more than lobster.

13:14.513 --> 13:16.174
Man, do I love lobster!

13:16.248 --> 13:18.614
So, I'm setting up
for this 30-foot putt,

13:18.684 --> 13:20.311
I got a chance for an eagle.

13:20.385 --> 13:21.682
An eagle. Now, sweetie...

13:21.754 --> 13:23.779
Steal her bracelet.

13:23.856 --> 13:25.483
I saw you looking at it.

13:25.557 --> 13:26.649
Steal it.

13:26.725 --> 13:27.919
You know you want it.

13:27.993 --> 13:30.757
We're retired, baby.
All I want is you.

13:30.829 --> 13:34.195
Come on, let yourself go.
Have fun.

13:34.265 --> 13:35.698
I bet you can't get it.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.167
Of course I can, but I won't.

13:39.203 --> 13:40.295
Bet you can't.

13:40.371 --> 13:43.704
Max. Aren't you having a good time?

13:44.308 --> 13:45.434
Please come again.

13:45.510 --> 13:48.502
Maxwell, this one's on me.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.809
Oh, thank you very much.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.645
That's weird, I can't find my wallet.
Did I give you my wallet?

13:55.720 --> 13:56.709
No, you didn't give me your wallet.

13:56.788 --> 13:59.655
That's so weird! I could swear
I put it in my pocket before I came here.

13:59.724 --> 14:02.022
It's okay, big fellow.
I got it.

14:02.093 --> 14:03.651
Oh, thanks, Maxwell.

14:03.728 --> 14:05.127
That is so sweet.

14:05.196 --> 14:07.824
Where the hell is my wallet?

14:12.153 --> 14:14.713
Luc, what's in
the Caribbean Romance again?

14:14.789 --> 14:16.256
Light rum, amaretto,

14:16.323 --> 14:19.520
orange juice, pineapple juice,
and a splash of grenadine.

14:19.593 --> 14:22.494
What about the Pink Paradise?

14:22.563 --> 14:26.932
Coconut rum, amaretto, cranberry juice,
orange juice, and pineapple juice.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.135
People actually drink this stuff?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.172
They love it.
You know, it makes them feel exotic.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.763
Give me a Jack on the rocks.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.435
It doesn't have a fancy name,
but if it was good enough for Frank,

14:37.510 --> 14:38.909
it's good enough for me.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.445
Frank?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.037
Who's Frank?

14:42.115 --> 14:43.639
Sinatra.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.616
Did Frank take an umbrella?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.444
Not even when it was raining.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.049
Hi, baby.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.626
How was it?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.668
Amazing! You'd love it!

15:02.735 --> 15:05.863
The only sounds are your breath
and your heartbeat.

15:05.939 --> 15:10.638
The reef is like a thousand jewels,
sparkling right in front of you.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.837
You should really try it next time.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.437
Mm-hmm. Well,
I like to breathe unassisted.

15:15.265 --> 15:16.926
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.867
I thought you liked it
when I give you mouth to mouth.

16:53.928 --> 16:55.259
State your business.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.155
You're gonna shoot
an FBI agent, Burdett?

16:58.232 --> 17:00.257
All I see is an intruder...

17:01.269 --> 17:03.794
...who just swallowed $80 worth
of my whiskey.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.730
Put down the weapon.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.299
Don't make me shoot you again.

17:10.011 --> 17:11.035
Again?

17:11.112 --> 17:12.943
Is that the way we're gonna play it?

17:17.483 --> 17:19.781
What are you doing
in my house, Agent Lloyd?

17:19.853 --> 17:22.753
Sitting, drinking, eating chocolate.

17:22.823 --> 17:25.758
- You have a warrant?
- FBI doesn't have jurisdiction here.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.453
I know, that's why I came down here.

17:27.527 --> 17:28.960
Oh, I don't think it is.

17:29.029 --> 17:32.260
<i>The Seven Seas Navigator
docking here for a solid week.</i>

17:32.332 --> 17:35.267
They're having a nice promotion
for the maiden voyage,

17:35.335 --> 17:38.065
calling it the Diamond Cruise.

17:38.138 --> 17:41.164
A gem exhibit whose star attraction is

17:41.241 --> 17:43.368
the third Napoleon Diamond.

17:43.443 --> 17:45.843
Stop me when I get to the part
you don't know.

17:45.912 --> 17:48.176
It's the only one you two haven't stolen.

17:48.248 --> 17:49.272
Allegedly.

17:49.349 --> 17:52.011
And it's gonna be right here
for a whole week... the last of the set...

17:52.085 --> 17:54.451
and I suspect you plan to purloin it.

17:54.521 --> 17:55.579
Well, I don't.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.520
So finish your drink and get out.

17:57.591 --> 17:59.081
It's okay to be happy to see me.

17:59.159 --> 18:02.287
Just because you're English doesn't
mean you need to hide your emotions.

18:02.362 --> 18:04.387
I'm Irish.
We let people know how we feel.

18:04.464 --> 18:05.863
Now fuck off.

18:08.702 --> 18:11.466
And you can take any bugs you planted
along with you.

18:11.538 --> 18:13.095
I'm retired.

18:13.172 --> 18:16.266
A retired guy wouldn't have anything
to worry about from those.

18:16.342 --> 18:17.832
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Take it.

18:17.910 --> 18:19.502
You might learn something from it.

18:19.578 --> 18:21.341
But return it for me.
It's overdue.

18:21.414 --> 18:23.143
Give my love to Lola, will you?

18:34.693 --> 18:36.251
How was the tennis lesson?

18:36.328 --> 18:39.229
Great. The teacher says I'm a natural.

18:39.298 --> 18:42.096
He says I've got the best backside
he's ever seen.

18:42.168 --> 18:43.226
<i>That's backhand.</i>

18:43.302 --> 18:44.428
Don't go in there.

18:44.503 --> 18:46.698
- Why?
- Let's talk.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.401
Okay, you're making me nervous,
and I don't get nervous.

18:53.112 --> 18:54.977
Agent Lloyd just left.

18:55.047 --> 18:56.742
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

18:56.816 --> 18:58.340
He came to show me this.

19:04.423 --> 19:06.789
Damn it, Max.

19:06.859 --> 19:08.349
Is this what we're here for?

19:08.427 --> 19:10.986
No. It's not.

19:13.431 --> 19:15.490
This is not retirement at all.

19:15.567 --> 19:18.001
This is the next setup, isn't it?

19:18.069 --> 19:21.061
<i>Babe, you chose
this island, remember?</i>

19:23.208 --> 19:25.768
I hope you don't think
this is a gift from God.

19:25.844 --> 19:29.473
'Cause this is God messing with us.

19:34.219 --> 19:36.312
Oh, no. Max.

19:37.155 --> 19:38.884
Did Stan do this?

19:38.957 --> 19:40.720
Sort of.

19:41.759 --> 19:44.387
I figured he'd bug the place,
so I started checking.

19:44.462 --> 19:46.362
Did you find any?

19:46.431 --> 19:48.695
Only what he wanted me to find.

19:49.701 --> 19:51.396
There's another one here somewhere.

19:53.771 --> 19:55.398
Now, don't worry.
I already checked.

19:55.473 --> 19:56.667
There's nothing in there.

19:56.741 --> 19:58.265
That's the problem.

19:58.343 --> 19:59.970
There's nothing in here.

20:04.649 --> 20:06.172
What is it?
What's wrong?

20:06.250 --> 20:08.844
I hid the bullet in the camera.

20:08.919 --> 20:10.580
What bullet?

20:10.654 --> 20:12.849
The one he shot you with.

20:12.923 --> 20:14.481
Oh, no.

20:15.692 --> 20:19.059
I kept it to remind me
of how close I came to losing you.

20:19.129 --> 20:21.654
Lola, you know that bullet
puts me on the scene.

20:21.732 --> 20:24.462
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

20:24.535 --> 20:26.526
I'll get it back.

20:42.152 --> 20:44.780
Good morning, Mr. Lloyd.
Your suite is ready.

20:44.855 --> 20:47.187
- Suite?
- Suite, sir.

20:47.257 --> 20:49.191
It's a larger room.

20:50.594 --> 20:54.928
Atlantis reserves this bridge suite
for our more dignified guests.

20:58.135 --> 21:01.297
Breakfast is on the house, these are
vouchers for free tennis lessons,

21:01.370 --> 21:05.272
complimentary skin exfoliant,
seaweed body wrap and facial scrub,

21:05.341 --> 21:08.003
located in the spa on the club level.

21:08.077 --> 21:09.510
Also, please remember.

21:09.579 --> 21:14.346
Shoes and shirt are required
in all public spaces at all times.

21:46.315 --> 21:47.543
State your business.

21:47.617 --> 21:50.643
You can't bribe me
with a seaweed body wrap, Max.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.381
This doesn't buy you one bit of space.

21:52.455 --> 21:54.548
I'm gonna be on you wherever you go.

21:54.624 --> 21:55.750
It's no bribe, Stanley.

21:55.825 --> 21:58.224
I just want you to see
that if you lead the kind of life I do,

21:58.293 --> 22:00.488
stealing is the last thing on your mind.

22:02.864 --> 22:03.853
Mr. Lloyd.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.528
Are you ready for your massage?

22:07.836 --> 22:09.667
I'll do your back.

22:09.738 --> 22:11.672
I'll do your front.

22:12.841 --> 22:14.331
You son of a bitch.

22:24.252 --> 22:25.981
- Lola?
- Yeah.

22:27.489 --> 22:30.515
- He hid it in a black jewelry box.
- Good job.

22:30.592 --> 22:31.889
Thank you.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.860
Talented masseuse.

22:34.696 --> 22:35.856
You get rid of it this time.

22:35.930 --> 22:37.420
I will.

22:38.266 --> 22:40.234
Good evening.
May I take your order?

22:42.203 --> 22:44.228
No, thank you.
I just lost my appetite.

22:44.306 --> 22:45.534
Just as well.

22:45.607 --> 22:48.405
I don't take orders from criminals,
I arrest them.

22:48.476 --> 22:50.068
Or fall asleep trying.

22:50.612 --> 22:52.307
So you're admitting you were there.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.348
No. I read about it in the papers,
just like everyone else.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.407
You're famous.

22:58.285 --> 22:59.775
I'm a punch line.

23:00.387 --> 23:04.517
But like my grandma used to say,
he who laughs last laughs loudest.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.354
By the way,
return that movie, would you?

23:06.427 --> 23:08.019
The store called.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.824
I haven't finished it yet.

23:09.897 --> 23:13.025
They catch the thief,
but it's not who you think it is.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.068
I don't like those twist endings.

23:15.135 --> 23:16.568
Well, we don't like you.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.428
Lola.

23:21.041 --> 23:22.565
They're playing your song.

23:22.643 --> 23:25.635
Why don't you take Stanley
for a dance?

23:25.713 --> 23:27.271
He's feeling lonely.

23:27.348 --> 23:30.044
And I am feeling charitable.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.251
Let's go, Stan.

23:32.419 --> 23:33.545
Really?

23:35.089 --> 23:37.148
I'll try to have her back by dawn.

23:51.738 --> 23:52.932
Constable...

23:54.841 --> 23:56.240
Can I help you?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.106
I wanna talk to Mooré.

23:58.177 --> 23:59.508
Get out of the way.

23:59.579 --> 24:02.412
Monsieur Mooré is currently socializing.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.417
Interrupting a man's leisure
is harassment.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.851
That's not harassment.

24:09.222 --> 24:10.519
You feel that?

24:10.590 --> 24:12.854
- Ooh.
- That's harassment.

24:12.925 --> 24:17.055
And you tell your boss
this is just the beginning.

24:17.130 --> 24:20.463
I have two hands,
and I can't be bought.

24:25.471 --> 24:28.235
Excuse me, constable.
May I have a word with you?

24:37.016 --> 24:40.645
<i>Audrey. Where you get that sugar?</i>

24:40.720 --> 24:42.847
Listen, Stan,
I know what you're doing.

24:42.922 --> 24:46.982
But if you drag Max into your game,
he will not lose.

24:47.058 --> 24:49.083
Eventually, they all lose.

24:49.161 --> 24:50.753
Not my Max.

24:50.829 --> 24:53.263
Do yourself a favor...
leave us alone.

24:53.331 --> 24:57.324
We're just a couple of retirees
trying to enjoy the island life.

24:57.402 --> 25:00.894
All the same, I'll stick around,
see what develops.

25:02.340 --> 25:03.568
Excuse me.

25:03.642 --> 25:05.303
In a second, honey.
You'll get your chance.

25:05.377 --> 25:08.175
Damn, I got the stink on me tonight.

25:08.246 --> 25:09.975
Step off the dance floor, sir.

25:10.782 --> 25:12.249
Hey!

25:12.317 --> 25:14.046
- Have fun, Stan.
- Hey. Lola!

25:14.119 --> 25:16.747
Police.
Raise your hands, sir.

25:17.756 --> 25:20.520
I'm law.
Federal B.I.?

25:27.199 --> 25:31.397
It is illegal on this island to carry
a concealed weapon without a permit.

25:31.470 --> 25:33.097
I'm working a suspect.

25:36.174 --> 25:38.870
Are you not supposed to inform
local authorities when you arrive,

25:38.944 --> 25:41.435
Agent Stanley P. Lloyd?

25:44.748 --> 25:46.909
- You know him?
- He's my suspect.

25:46.984 --> 25:50.215
Well, we're still gonna have to
take this to the station and register it.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.584
You're letting the criminal go.

25:51.655 --> 25:52.849
This is crazy.

25:52.923 --> 25:54.481
You think this is crazy?

25:54.558 --> 25:57.356
<i>Your dancing, that was crazy.</i>

25:57.428 --> 25:58.986
This way, Agent Lloyd.

25:59.063 --> 26:01.031
Welcome to paradise.

26:06.003 --> 26:07.265
Okay.

26:07.338 --> 26:10.273
- The watermarks and holograms match.
- Oh.

26:10.341 --> 26:12.468
But I still have to register the gun.

26:18.182 --> 26:19.774
You have a nice smile.

26:19.850 --> 26:21.681
I haven't smiled at you.

26:21.752 --> 26:23.379
You will.

26:25.890 --> 26:28.358
That's just the way I feel about it,
and they have to deal with it.

26:28.425 --> 26:29.449
Yes, sir.

26:29.660 --> 26:31.560
Ah, Sophie.

26:31.629 --> 26:33.460
I need to speak to you.

26:33.531 --> 26:36.125
I'm getting complaints
about you bothering Henri Mooré.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.190
Just doing my job, Zacharias.

26:38.268 --> 26:40.327
The man is practically
the unofficial mayor of the island.

26:40.403 --> 26:42.030
In one year, he's made
everyone here like him,

26:42.105 --> 26:43.970
something you haven't been
able to do in a lifetime.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.804
I guess we can't all be
the kiss-ass politician you are.

26:47.577 --> 26:50.478
I want you to stay behind tonight
so we can discuss your attitude.

26:50.547 --> 26:52.208
You knew about my attitude
the day we got married

26:52.282 --> 26:53.772
and knew about it
the day we got divorced.

26:53.850 --> 26:56.683
You're not gonna learn
any more about it tonight.

26:56.753 --> 27:00.689
Besides, I have plans
with Special Agent Lloyd of the FBI.

27:00.757 --> 27:02.782
He's just arrived on the island.

27:03.459 --> 27:04.653
Is that so?

27:05.495 --> 27:06.553
Shall we?

27:06.629 --> 27:08.290
We shall.

27:13.069 --> 27:14.764
She's feisty.

27:19.876 --> 27:23.334
Mmm. Isn't it beautiful?

27:24.747 --> 27:25.907
Yeah.

27:28.084 --> 27:29.813
Is it enough?

27:30.553 --> 27:31.781
Of course it is.

27:44.666 --> 27:48.033
Some people say the only way
to rid yourself of temptation

27:48.103 --> 27:50.196
is to yield to it.

27:52.374 --> 27:54.103
I don't know about that.

27:56.178 --> 28:01.172
I say turn your back on temptation...

28:01.984 --> 28:07.217
...or substitute something
more tempting.

28:21.503 --> 28:23.835
See how easy that was?

28:33.047 --> 28:35.481
What's the shortest amount of time
you've ever known a guy

28:35.549 --> 28:39.076
before you kissed him?

28:39.687 --> 28:42.485
I see what you're thinking,
and you can forget it.

28:42.556 --> 28:46.458
Guys come down to this island looking
for a slice of paradise with a local girl,

28:46.527 --> 28:48.859
and they will say anything to get it.

28:49.930 --> 28:52.558
I resent being lumped in with all guys,

28:52.633 --> 28:55.864
though, admittedly,
I would say anything right now.

28:55.936 --> 28:58.234
How long have you been chasing Max?

29:00.241 --> 29:04.200
Seven years... ever since the first
Napoleon Diamond went missing.

29:04.278 --> 29:07.338
I got to the scene,
took a few shots at the getaway car.

29:07.415 --> 29:12.079
Next day, bottle of champagne arrives
at FBI Headquarters for me,

29:12.153 --> 29:16.954
with a note says,
"Aim for the tires next time. "

29:17.024 --> 29:18.685
He was baiting you.

29:18.759 --> 29:21.694
- Hmm.
- Is there a money trail?

29:21.762 --> 29:24.754
Everything's plain...
taxes, bank accounts.

29:24.832 --> 29:28.062
He doesn't buy
expensive paintings, yachts, nothing.

29:28.134 --> 29:33.197
I think it's more about the challenge
and the alibi... that's his work of art.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.104
Sounds like you admire him.

29:36.076 --> 29:39.671
Would I like to live one day
in his velvety slippers?

29:39.746 --> 29:41.179
Maybe

29:41.247 --> 29:43.112
But I don't admire him.

29:43.183 --> 29:45.208
He's beat me too many times for that.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.480
Maybe you need the female touch.

29:49.022 --> 29:51.047
That's exactly what I need.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.616
Listen, I want a big arrest,
you need local help.

29:54.694 --> 29:57.060
I'll extend the FBI courtesy on this one.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.496
As long as I'm riding shotgun.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.434
What's going on?

30:08.508 --> 30:10.601
I'm expanding the deck.

30:10.677 --> 30:12.338
You're trying to stay busy.

30:12.412 --> 30:15.575
Look, on this deck,
we are going to sit here

30:15.648 --> 30:18.674
and watch sunsets until we get old.

30:19.419 --> 30:21.011
Can't wait.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.678
Where are you going?

30:22.755 --> 30:24.279
You said I need a hobby.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.347
I guess I'll go find one.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.449
Really?

30:27.526 --> 30:29.653
I'll call you later.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.251
He's here.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.995
The centerpiece of our exhibit.

31:11.069 --> 31:14.527
Napoleon had three priceless diamonds
set into the hilt of his sword.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.700
After his defeat, they were pried out
and dispersed around the globe.

31:17.776 --> 31:21.734
This is one of the rare occasions the last
remaining diamond is on public display.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.407
And next, we have
some rare Egyptian gems.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.737
Cute little rock.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.541
I'm just here to look.

31:56.614 --> 31:57.740
Just as well.

31:57.815 --> 32:01.114
With six cameras...
four stationary, two revolving,

32:01.185 --> 32:02.948
a dozen I.R. Motion sensors...

32:03.020 --> 32:05.682
Sixteen.
You missed the ones at ankle level.

32:05.756 --> 32:08.224
Plus your standard
24-hour rotating guards.

32:08.292 --> 32:10.783
Unbreakable polycarbonate display,

32:10.862 --> 32:13.660
controlled by an uncopyable
magnetic key card.

32:15.565 --> 32:19.626
I just realized...
you could never get it anyway.

32:23.106 --> 32:24.334
You're right.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.408
When you're right, you're right.

32:28.144 --> 32:29.475
It's impossible.

33:15.891 --> 33:17.290
Give me a ride.

33:17.359 --> 33:18.519
I don't think so.

33:18.594 --> 33:20.789
Maybe you should think again.

33:46.388 --> 33:50.484
May I present Monsieur Henri Mooré.

33:51.093 --> 33:52.526
Mr. Burdett.

33:53.128 --> 33:54.686
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.

33:54.763 --> 33:56.663
Oh, you're an American.

33:56.732 --> 33:59.292
Hmm. Henri Mooré?

33:59.368 --> 34:01.336
Ah. My name is Henry Moore.

34:01.403 --> 34:03.894
I placed the thing on the "e".

34:03.973 --> 34:05.964
I felt it more appropriate
to my surroundings.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.940
- Oh.
- Please.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.038
I imagine you're wondering
why you're here.

34:14.114 --> 34:16.049
Well...

34:16.117 --> 34:18.516
Forgive Jean-Paul's tactics, Mr. Burdett,

34:18.585 --> 34:23.080
but to put it bluntly, the impoverished
people of this island need your help.

34:24.792 --> 34:27.693
Five years ago, I was
a successful businessman in Detroit.

34:27.762 --> 34:29.889
While vacationing on this island,

34:29.964 --> 34:32.091
I was sitting on the beach
drinking a...

34:32.166 --> 34:34.031
Citron martini.

34:36.971 --> 34:38.905
I don't recall what I was drinking...
it's not important.

34:38.973 --> 34:40.770
But I experienced a revelation...

34:40.842 --> 34:44.972
that I had been brought to this island to
provide the commensurate social services

34:45.045 --> 34:48.277
that were sadly lacking
for the poorer elements of society here.

34:48.349 --> 34:51.318
And you want me to buy a table
at your next fundraiser.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.181
No, Mr. Burdett.

34:54.255 --> 34:56.085
But I am offering you the opportunity

34:56.157 --> 34:59.058
to participate in the vital growth
of my infrastructure.

34:59.127 --> 35:00.492
Uh-huh. How's that?

35:01.062 --> 35:02.995
I want you to steal me that diamond.

35:05.866 --> 35:07.094
I'm not a criminal.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.465
Right. Neither am I.

35:09.536 --> 35:11.060
Good.
Then we understand each other.

35:11.138 --> 35:12.571
- Yes.
- Yeah.

35:12.639 --> 35:14.800
Let me show you around, Mr. Burdett.

35:18.245 --> 35:20.873
Do you think it fair
that the indigenous of this island

35:20.947 --> 35:23.745
are not allowed to enter the casinos
unless they work there?

35:25.185 --> 35:27.619
Why is it that only the rich should enjoy

35:27.687 --> 35:31.919
pharmaceutically-assisted moments
of personal introspection?

35:31.992 --> 35:35.723
The safety and security found
in owning your own machine gun.

35:36.763 --> 35:38.060
The pleasures derived

35:38.131 --> 35:42.431
from financially-procured
female companionship.

35:44.671 --> 35:47.902
The underprivileged should not be
denied these essential diversions.

35:47.974 --> 35:50.272
I mean, look around you, Mr. Burdett.

35:50.343 --> 35:51.935
No one is turned away.

35:52.712 --> 35:55.510
All I do, I do for the people.

35:55.582 --> 35:57.174
And why do you need
the diamond for that?

35:57.884 --> 36:01.512
I have an urgent need to expand
my humanitarian program.

36:01.587 --> 36:04.818
A cash injection
in the tens of millions of dollars

36:04.890 --> 36:06.687
would relieve the entire Caribbean.

36:08.828 --> 36:11.626
What I'm suggesting
is a partnership, Mr. Burdett.

36:11.697 --> 36:13.927
You are a stranger to this island.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.967
I can give you what you don't have...

36:16.035 --> 36:22.167
access to the marina, the crews,
rotation schedules, whatever you need.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.260
I couldn't sleep.
Didn't wanna wake you.

36:50.569 --> 36:53.037
I saw you on the ship yesterday.

36:55.373 --> 36:58.399
I had a feeling you might be there, too.

37:04.983 --> 37:07.747
Don't you ever feel
we weren't quite finished?

37:09.787 --> 37:13.154
Look, Max, I miss it, too.

37:14.259 --> 37:16.159
We were great.

37:16.227 --> 37:19.594
And we went out
at the top of our game, undefeated.

37:19.664 --> 37:21.962
The best time to quit.

37:22.667 --> 37:24.259
Maybe

37:26.905 --> 37:28.497
Max, I cased it.

37:28.573 --> 37:32.100
It's not a one man job, and there's
no way you're pulling me into it.

37:32.177 --> 37:33.644
We're retired.

37:33.711 --> 37:36.908
Now the challenge is
to find joy in simple things.

37:36.981 --> 37:39.609
And I like that challenge.

38:08.278 --> 38:09.302
Yeah?

38:09.379 --> 38:10.437
I lied on the ship.

38:10.514 --> 38:11.947
<i>I could get it.</i>

38:12.015 --> 38:13.004
<i>Here's how.</i>

38:13.083 --> 38:15.779
<i>I'd cut the camera feed
and go in from behind the exhibit.</i>

38:15.852 --> 38:18.821
It's blow able from the storage room,
and I'd do it after 10 P.M.

38:18.889 --> 38:20.550
Why?

38:20.624 --> 38:23.525
The retired arthritic cops
always get that shift.

38:24.461 --> 38:26.429
So that's how you do it.

38:26.496 --> 38:27.963
And now I've told you.

38:28.031 --> 38:30.158
So now I can't.

38:42.079 --> 38:43.706
Oh, my God.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.907
- What are you doing?
- I'm cooking.

38:45.983 --> 38:48.075
- Since when?
- This morning.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.811
We are decent law-abiding people,

38:49.885 --> 38:52.854
and decent law-abiding people
cook omelets for breakfast.

38:53.723 --> 38:54.815
Oh.

38:55.725 --> 38:57.124
State your business.

38:57.193 --> 38:58.626
<i>You almost had me last night</i>

38:58.694 --> 39:02.061
<i>with that old David Copperfield
smoke and mirrors trick.</i>

39:02.131 --> 39:06.329
"Look at my assistant with the big tits
while I take the Rolex right off your wrist. "

39:06.402 --> 39:07.494
What do you want about her?

39:07.570 --> 39:09.435
I wanna know
how you're really gonna do it,

39:09.505 --> 39:12.531
and you're gonna tell me
while we're fishing.

39:12.608 --> 39:13.802
Fishing?

39:13.876 --> 39:15.207
I don't fish.

39:15.278 --> 39:17.212
I got a boat stacked with beer.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.269
Drink it yourself.

39:18.347 --> 39:20.281
<i>You might as well come.
You're paying for it.</i>

39:20.349 --> 39:22.214
<i>I charged it to my suite.</i>

39:22.285 --> 39:24.845
All the same, Stanley, I'll pass.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.944
There is an option.

39:26.022 --> 39:29.924
I get the local police to bring you down
to the station, we sweat you there.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.220
<i>And I do mean sweat.</i>

39:31.294 --> 39:34.661
<i>There's no air conditioning.
So dress light.</i>

39:34.730 --> 39:36.664
The eggs on this island taste funny.

39:36.732 --> 39:39.257
They must have some weird chickens.

39:41.937 --> 39:43.233
What'll it be, Max?

39:43.305 --> 39:44.363
I'll see you soon.

39:54.115 --> 39:57.278
Tell me this isn't better
than standing in some lineup.

39:58.286 --> 39:59.753
I've never been in a lineup.

40:06.461 --> 40:08.952
Ooh, that's a hell of a watch.

40:09.030 --> 40:10.292
What's that kind of thing run you?

40:10.365 --> 40:12.492
A couple of grand.

40:14.703 --> 40:17.831
Why don't you pick one up
on the Bureau's expense account?

40:17.906 --> 40:20.966
Oh, they keep me on a real tight leash.

40:21.042 --> 40:22.737
I got you to thank for that.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.210
Ah.

40:25.513 --> 40:27.071
Whoo! It's cookin' out here.

40:30.018 --> 40:32.248
So if I didn't shoot you,
where'd you get the screen door?

40:34.689 --> 40:36.247
Knitting accident.

40:48.435 --> 40:50.403
Dab some of this on my back, will you?

40:50.904 --> 40:52.030
Are you serious?

40:52.106 --> 40:54.904
Yeah. I've got delicate skin.
I don't wanna burn.

41:01.248 --> 41:04.411
I bet you were the best kid in the
neighborhood at hide-and-seek, huh?

41:04.485 --> 41:05.782
So you joined the Bureau.

41:05.853 --> 41:08.219
Yeah, I found them all.

41:09.923 --> 41:11.652
No one ever found me.

41:12.459 --> 41:16.691
Once I found a good spot,
I'd stay there for days.

41:20.167 --> 41:21.156
There you go.

41:21.602 --> 41:23.763
Now, turn around.
I'll do you.

41:23.837 --> 41:24.929
I'll handle it.

41:25.005 --> 41:26.836
No, come on.
You're gonna burn.

41:35.848 --> 41:37.008
Good.

41:38.117 --> 41:39.106
Okay.

41:39.185 --> 41:40.948
There. That's good.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.851
Wait. Don't you want me
to coat everything?

41:42.922 --> 41:44.355
That's good. My pole.

41:44.424 --> 41:46.221
No way, man!
I'm only doing your back!

41:46.292 --> 41:47.281
My pole!

41:47.360 --> 41:48.725
Hey, we got something.
Come on.

41:48.795 --> 41:49.853
Oh, oh, oh. Look at this!

41:49.929 --> 41:51.760
Oh. We got something here, Stanley.

41:51.831 --> 41:52.820
Ooh! Aah!

41:52.899 --> 41:54.924
Shit! Come on!

41:55.001 --> 41:56.593
Come on! Help me pull it up.

41:56.669 --> 41:58.637
Don't lose it, don't lose it!

42:01.541 --> 42:02.940
- It's a monster.
- We can do it!

42:03.009 --> 42:05.102
This is big.
Okay, come on, pull!

42:05.178 --> 42:06.645
<i>- Are you pulling?
- I'm pulling, man.</i>

42:06.712 --> 42:07.736
Jesus Christ!

42:07.814 --> 42:10.612
Stanley!
One, two, three!

42:13.419 --> 42:14.443
Jesus Christ!

42:14.520 --> 42:16.147
It's a shark, it's a shark.

42:16.222 --> 42:17.246
Yeah.

42:19.225 --> 42:20.817
Why is it not moving?

42:20.893 --> 42:22.986
- Maybe it's in shock.
- What do you wanna do?

42:23.062 --> 42:25.758
Maybe it's dead.
I mean, it looks dead.

42:27.467 --> 42:28.661
Go over and shake it.

42:28.734 --> 42:30.964
- Why me?
- Well, you're FBI.

42:31.037 --> 42:32.526
What's that have to do with anything?

42:32.604 --> 42:35.402
If it bites your arm off,
you get disability for the rest of your life.

42:35.474 --> 42:36.771
<i>- Go!
- You hooked it.</i>

42:36.842 --> 42:37.934
<i>You go see if it's alive.</i>

42:38.009 --> 42:39.670
<i>Yeah, I hooked it,
so you go see if it's alive.</i>

42:39.744 --> 42:41.006
- Go!
- Hey, hey!

42:41.079 --> 42:43.980
Oh, okay.
Here I go.

42:45.183 --> 42:47.014
I'm just gonna sneak up on it.

42:47.752 --> 42:48.776
Why are you whispering?

42:48.854 --> 42:50.719
So it won't know the plan.

42:51.523 --> 42:53.081
Hey.

42:59.564 --> 43:00.861
- Aah!
- Aah! Shit!

43:00.932 --> 43:02.456
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

43:07.038 --> 43:10.064
You have the right to remain silent!

43:11.142 --> 43:12.439
Yeah, it's dead.

43:15.380 --> 43:17.109
Yeah.

43:41.038 --> 43:42.062
Look at them.

43:42.139 --> 43:45.438
If you didn't know any better,
you'd think they were friends.

43:45.509 --> 43:47.443
You must be Lola.

43:48.112 --> 43:49.170
Sophie?

43:50.047 --> 43:51.241
Nice gun.

43:51.315 --> 43:52.680
Sig Sauer P228.

43:52.750 --> 43:54.615
Custom trigger action.

43:54.685 --> 43:55.811
Oh.

43:55.886 --> 43:57.513
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

43:57.588 --> 43:59.749
- Chanel?
- Cruz collection.

44:01.759 --> 44:03.249
How bad was it?

44:04.094 --> 44:05.789
Oh, not too bad.

44:07.431 --> 44:08.864
Sophie seems nice.

44:09.533 --> 44:10.898
Yeah, for a cop.

44:12.036 --> 44:13.833
Lola seems cool.

44:13.904 --> 44:15.030
For a thief.

44:30.286 --> 44:31.719
Yes!

44:36.893 --> 44:38.383
I resign. You win.

44:38.461 --> 44:39.860
Make a wish.

44:39.929 --> 44:41.829
Okay.

44:41.898 --> 44:45.197
I wish you'd write your vows.

44:58.481 --> 44:59.812
<i>I'm so tense.</i>

44:59.882 --> 45:02.043
<i>Come here.
Let me relax you.</i>

45:02.118 --> 45:04.916
What are you doing?
Why are you taking off your clothes?

45:04.988 --> 45:06.046
Now we're talkin'.

45:06.122 --> 45:07.680
<i>Are you being naughty?</i>

45:07.757 --> 45:09.349
<i>Naughty enough to spank.</i>

45:09.425 --> 45:11.825
Oh, yeah!

45:11.894 --> 45:14.920
<i>I'll bite you.
Can I bite you?</i>

45:14.998 --> 45:17.523
<i>The door.
Are we expecting anyone?</i>

45:17.600 --> 45:19.692
<i>Yeah. A friend.</i>

45:19.768 --> 45:21.463
<i>- A friend?
- A friend?</i>

45:21.536 --> 45:22.798
<i>A girlfriend.</i>

45:22.871 --> 45:23.929
<i>You didn't.</i>

45:24.006 --> 45:25.473
<i>I love you. Baby.</i>

45:25.540 --> 45:28.134
<i>You know I'll do anything for you.</i>

45:30.545 --> 45:31.637
Wait here.

45:31.713 --> 45:33.237
What's she gonna do?

45:34.683 --> 45:36.742
Tell him.
Tell him.

45:36.818 --> 45:38.945
<i>She's gonna help me relax you.</i>

45:39.021 --> 45:40.545
<i>You're kidding.</i>

45:41.323 --> 45:42.381
Nice.

45:42.457 --> 45:44.049
<i>You're gonna like this.</i>

45:44.126 --> 45:45.457
Lucky bastard.

45:45.527 --> 45:47.586
<i>- Who is she?
- You'll see.</i>

45:48.230 --> 45:52.360
<i>Max. I'd like you to meet Stan's mom.</i>

46:00.042 --> 46:01.202
<i>Night. Stan.</i>

46:05.180 --> 46:06.408
Son of a...

47:03.270 --> 47:05.067
You're only in port 48 more hours.

47:05.139 --> 47:06.834
Stay on high alert.

47:06.941 --> 47:09.876
Agent Lloyd, we have the most sophisticated
security system

47:09.944 --> 47:12.434
ever installed on a seagoing vessel.

47:12.512 --> 47:13.911
And you'll need it.

47:14.614 --> 47:15.842
Excuse me, sir.

47:16.816 --> 47:18.750
There's been a security breach.

47:43.209 --> 47:44.301
Don't move!

47:46.746 --> 47:47.770
Turn around.

47:50.083 --> 47:51.209
Turn around!

47:54.020 --> 47:55.180
- No!
- Stan!

48:28.754 --> 48:30.085
Damn it.

48:38.597 --> 48:40.531
The other side!

48:56.048 --> 48:57.208
Just stop him!

48:57.282 --> 48:58.681
Let's do it, come on!

49:21.572 --> 49:24.598
<i>Although the famed
Napoleon Diamond was undisturbed.</i>

49:24.675 --> 49:26.438
<i>The unknown intruder knocked out</i>

49:26.510 --> 49:29.138
<i>a Seven Seas Navigator
maintenance worker.</i>

49:29.213 --> 49:32.546
<i>Stole his uniform.
And slipped onto the ship.</i>

49:40.558 --> 49:42.389
You're cheating on me, aren't you?

49:43.828 --> 49:45.625
What are you talking about?

49:45.696 --> 49:48.563
Maybe not with a woman,
but with a diamond.

49:49.333 --> 49:50.322
You want her.

49:50.401 --> 49:52.392
And I'm jealous.

49:52.470 --> 49:54.495
You've got nothing to worry about.

49:54.572 --> 49:56.437
Where were you tonight, Max?

49:56.507 --> 50:00.408
I've been home, writing my vows.

50:00.477 --> 50:01.466
Oh! Let me see.

50:01.544 --> 50:04.604
Sorry.
You have to wait.

50:05.615 --> 50:07.708
Well, I'm not gonna let
that little bitch take my man.

50:07.784 --> 50:09.445
I'm gonna fight for what's mine.

50:09.519 --> 50:10.611
Really?

50:10.687 --> 50:13.121
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

50:13.189 --> 50:14.747
I'm a thief.

50:15.692 --> 50:18.126
I know a thing or two about distraction.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.262
It's a beautiful jewel, Max.

50:27.237 --> 50:31.401
But I guarantee you,
it's no fun in the tub.

50:36.446 --> 50:39.176
I had him.
You shoulda stayed out of my way.

50:39.249 --> 50:41.649
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sorry.

50:41.718 --> 50:44.516
You're the one who's hurt.
You should ice that.

50:44.587 --> 50:46.919
Why are men always trying
to protect women?

50:47.557 --> 50:48.888
'Cause you smell good.

50:48.959 --> 50:50.620
It's all about sex, isn't it?

50:50.694 --> 50:53.322
Why can't we just be
two cops working a case?

50:53.396 --> 50:55.091
Hey, I happen to agree with you.

50:55.165 --> 50:57.223
From now on,
we're just partners on this.

50:57.299 --> 50:58.459
Fine.

50:58.534 --> 51:00.832
- So, let's have dinner and discuss it.
- No, thanks.

51:00.903 --> 51:02.302
How about a steam?

51:02.371 --> 51:05.807
What... I... no, I always steam
with my partners.

51:06.542 --> 51:09.033
Okay, you wanna go
for a Jacuzzi, partner?

51:09.111 --> 51:11.671
I have a big tub in my room.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.352
We have to talk.

51:26.428 --> 51:29.158
Max. Great timing.
Ride with us.

51:29.231 --> 51:30.892
Can we just do this one on one?

51:30.966 --> 51:32.399
Oh, of course.

51:34.103 --> 51:37.197
<i>California dreaming...</i>

51:37.272 --> 51:40.867
Are you familiar with the pleasures
of anonymous love, Max?

51:42.311 --> 51:43.369
No.

51:44.413 --> 51:48.144
Recently I found myself experimenting
with alternative lifestyle parameters

51:48.217 --> 51:50.412
based largely
on the free love philosophy

51:50.486 --> 51:53.579
as found in the collected works
of The Mamas and The Papas.

51:54.756 --> 51:56.383
I never made that connection.

51:56.457 --> 51:57.583
Oh, it's there.

51:57.658 --> 52:00.422
That Michelle Phillips,
she could walk it like she talked it.

52:00.495 --> 52:02.861
Earl, burn one of my CDs for Max.

52:02.930 --> 52:04.454
Yes, sir.

52:16.611 --> 52:18.101
This is it, Max.

52:18.179 --> 52:19.510
My vision.

52:20.348 --> 52:22.976
My infrastructure growing
before our eyes.

52:23.818 --> 52:24.978
It used to be a children's hospital,

52:25.053 --> 52:28.921
but I'm revitalizing it
into a paramilitary training facility.

52:28.990 --> 52:32.721
More importantly,
that ship is leaving in two days.

52:36.364 --> 52:37.353
What's this?

52:37.432 --> 52:38.797
Everything you need.

52:39.367 --> 52:41.562
Schematics, detailed plan.

52:41.636 --> 52:43.661
You can do it yourself.

52:45.339 --> 52:47.364
Go in through the air conditioning vents.

52:47.442 --> 52:50.342
The exhibit is accessible
from the storage facility behind it.

52:50.410 --> 52:53.641
There's cameras there, so you're
gonna have to cut the central feed.

52:53.713 --> 52:55.442
Red wires in the control panel here.

52:55.515 --> 52:58.780
If you don't cut the red wire,
they'll see everything.

52:58.852 --> 53:01.480
- What next?
- Blow the wall.

53:01.555 --> 53:02.954
- C-4?
- Uh-uh.

53:03.023 --> 53:05.787
I'd use a shape charge
with a detonation cord.

53:05.859 --> 53:08.293
Smaller but more effective.

53:08.361 --> 53:12.559
And... you'd wanna blow it
after 10 P.M.

53:12.632 --> 53:15.726
- Why is that?
- Graveyard shift.

53:15.802 --> 53:18.532
Always the retired cops
with arthritis.

53:18.605 --> 53:20.300
That's how I'd do it.

53:21.608 --> 53:23.098
Then that's how I'll do it.

53:26.413 --> 53:28.677
You know, we're not partners anymore, Max.

53:29.382 --> 53:31.976
In fact, you see me,
cross the street.

53:56.142 --> 53:57.131
<i>You gotta go</i>

53:57.209 --> 53:59.040
<i>Go where you wanna go</i>

53:59.111 --> 54:01.045
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

54:01.113 --> 54:05.277
<i>With whoever
you wanna do it with</i>

54:05.351 --> 54:08.149
<i>You gotta go
where you wanna go</i>

54:08.220 --> 54:10.484
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

54:10.556 --> 54:14.754
<i>With whoever
you wanna do it with</i>

54:14.827 --> 54:20.390
<i>You don't understand
that a girl like...</i>

54:21.167 --> 54:23.362
Good afternoon. Atlantis.
How may I help?

54:23.435 --> 54:25.801
Mr. Lloyd,
the Bridge Suite, please.

54:27.339 --> 54:28.328
<i>Hello.</i>

54:28.407 --> 54:29.806
<i>- Stanley.
- Yeah.</i>

54:29.875 --> 54:32.571
<i>- It's Max, just checking in.
- Cut the crap. Max.</i>

54:32.645 --> 54:35.045
<i>You're making sure I'm in my room
and not following you.</i>

54:35.114 --> 54:37.981
How could you be following me
if you're in your room?

54:38.050 --> 54:40.540
<i>- See you soon, Stanley.
- Okay.</i>

56:20.984 --> 56:22.144
Hello!

56:23.253 --> 56:24.311
What?

56:25.722 --> 56:26.711
What?

56:26.790 --> 56:29.987
If you're gonna forward your calls,
don't tail me so close.

57:49.304 --> 57:50.965
Hey.

57:51.039 --> 57:52.870
I heard the call
over the radio.

57:52.941 --> 57:56.206
Every year there's one white boy
that goes down at Junkanoo.

57:56.911 --> 57:59.345
Here's what I found out.
Max closed escrow,

57:59.414 --> 58:02.076
and then a month later
the cruise booked the diamond.

58:02.150 --> 58:04.516
<i>- Maybe he is retired.
- I doubt it.</i>

58:04.586 --> 58:06.349
He met with Henri Mooré today,

58:06.421 --> 58:08.514
the biggest gangster on the island.

58:09.958 --> 58:11.289
Thanks for coming.

58:11.359 --> 58:14.294
You know, this one
you really do have to ice.

58:14.362 --> 58:16.762
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58:20.402 --> 58:21.596
Better?

58:22.404 --> 58:23.996
There's another one here.

58:26.607 --> 58:27.596
Now?

58:27.674 --> 58:30.108
This one's particularly painful.

58:33.714 --> 58:38.310
There's some referred pain.
It's somewhere around... here.

58:42.423 --> 58:44.653
I'll have to get hurt more often.

58:44.725 --> 58:47.216
And in more interesting places.

59:07.648 --> 59:10.116
- Oh, God, I'm vibrating!
- So am I.

59:10.184 --> 59:12.846
No. No, no.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.047
- I'm getting a call.
- What?

59:15.122 --> 59:17.249
Is nothing sacred?

59:17.324 --> 59:18.484
Shit, I have to go.

59:18.559 --> 59:21.493
Go? No, you can't go.
I just unwrapped my head.

59:21.561 --> 59:23.222
Sorry, I need a rain check.

59:23.296 --> 59:25.696
What, are you crazy?
It never rains here.

59:25.765 --> 59:26.891
Just give me five minutes, all right?

59:26.966 --> 59:29.526
Five minutes?
You should be embarrassed.

59:29.602 --> 59:30.899
Okay, three.

59:30.970 --> 59:33.063
Oh, Stan, come on.

59:33.139 --> 59:35.699
Okay, two!
Please don't make me beg. Please.

59:35.775 --> 59:37.072
A quick two?

59:37.143 --> 59:39.805
Oh, don't worry, I'm quick.

01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:07.628
Hello.

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:09.538
Mr. Burdett, it's Luc from the bar.

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:12.772
There's a guest down here
that's bombed that's shouting your name.

01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:15.746
Welcome to paradise, Frank!

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:23.418
Well, it's only paradise
for criminals, like Max Burdett.

01:00:23.488 --> 01:00:27.356
Yeah. I hear him.
I'll be right there.

01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:32.396
- Where'd he go?
- Over there.

01:00:32.464 --> 01:00:33.863
Oh, thanks, Luc.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.496
What are you doing to yourself?
What's wrong?

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:39.662
- Nothing.
- Nothing's wrong?

01:00:41.606 --> 01:00:43.870
Me and Sophie hooked up.

01:00:43.942 --> 01:00:45.807
And it was beautiful.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:48.676
But it's only gonna
last for one more day.

01:00:48.747 --> 01:00:50.078
Why is that?

01:00:50.148 --> 01:00:52.776
Because the ship's only gonna
be here 24 more hours,

01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:54.580
and you're gonna clip Napoleon III

01:00:54.653 --> 01:00:56.587
and make me look
like a jerk again.

01:01:00.392 --> 01:01:02.292
- I'll have another one!
- You've had enough.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.225
You are not my daddy.

01:01:04.296 --> 01:01:07.697
I didn't take you as an umbrella
kind of guy, Stan.

01:01:07.766 --> 01:01:09.791
These remoras really have
a kick to 'em.

01:01:09.868 --> 01:01:11.961
Hey, Stan, buck up.
You're a good agent.

01:01:12.037 --> 01:01:13.970
No, I'm not.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:17.007
You know, I used to blame you,
but now I see it clearly.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:19.508
It's not you, it's me.

01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:21.477
You've got genius, man.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:25.982
If I had an ounce
of what you have, I'd never stop.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:29.816
You've got a gift, man.
It's inspiring.

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:33.816
I love these remoras!

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.883
Bartender! Give me another one!

01:01:44.335 --> 01:01:46.200
It's okay, Stan.
It's okay.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.831
Luc, you're not working tonight, right?
Give us a hand here.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:51.670
Come on, Stan,
here you go. Come on.

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.835
Here you go, buddy.
Yeah.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:56.737
Come on, come on.

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:59.472
What about me?!

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:02.684
That's it, Stanley.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.414
Here you go.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:05.785
That's it.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.419
That's it. Here we go.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.363
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.909
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.775
- Max.
- Okay.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:59.669
Lola!

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.370
It's locked.
And don't try to break in.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.605
You're not welcome.

01:03:05.914 --> 01:03:07.541
I finished the deck.

01:03:07.616 --> 01:03:11.017
You promised to spend
the first sunset on it together.

01:03:11.086 --> 01:03:13.384
- Lola.
- That's not all.

01:03:14.222 --> 01:03:15.780
I found your notebook.

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:18.751
Lola.

01:03:18.827 --> 01:03:21.421
I'll sit down right now
and write my vows, okay?

01:03:26.134 --> 01:03:29.194
The vows are not for me,
they're for you.

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:32.434
You have to figure out if what
we have means anything to you.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:36.804
Come on, Max.

01:03:37.512 --> 01:03:39.639
Do you really think the third one's
gonna make you whole?

01:03:42.951 --> 01:03:46.182
- I don't know.
- Well, don't come back until you do.

01:03:47.956 --> 01:03:49.947
Where am I supposed to go?

01:03:54.596 --> 01:03:55.756
She threw me out.

01:03:57.165 --> 01:03:59.030
Why is it my problem?

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.568
'Cause every hotel
on the island is booked.

01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:09.341
Can I move
this surveillance stuff?

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:12.641
Don't mess with it!
It's very expensive.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.180
Listen, I'm not gonna
sleep on the floor.

01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:20.084
Well, I guess you're
out of luck.

01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:21.553
We both are.

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:30.554
Shit.

01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:42.608
So what'd you do?

01:04:43.844 --> 01:04:47.336
I missed our first sunset
on her new deck.

01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:49.708
That's it?

01:04:57.724 --> 01:04:59.783
I'm no good at sunsets.

01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.488
Of course you're not.

01:05:04.264 --> 01:05:07.893
The world is divided up between people
who like to watch the sunset

01:05:07.967 --> 01:05:09.332
and those who don't.

01:05:09.936 --> 01:05:11.369
Yeah.

01:05:11.437 --> 01:05:14.270
People like you
are never happy.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.243
You're anxious, type-A, egocentric
perfectionists who can't sit still

01:05:19.312 --> 01:05:23.271
and die alone with a million bucks
and a thousand regrets.

01:05:24.184 --> 01:05:26.880
The people who can relax,
enjoy the sunset,

01:05:26.953 --> 01:05:31.253
hold hands at the end of the day...
they're the happy ones.

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:36.926
So why can't you do that?

01:05:40.927 --> 01:05:42.927
because of you.

01:05:47.207 --> 01:05:49.004
Don't hog the blanket.

01:05:54.112 --> 01:05:56.046
- Good night, Max.
- Good night.

01:06:42.261 --> 01:06:44.354
You know, the Bureau's got
a "don't ask, don't tell" policy,

01:06:44.429 --> 01:06:46.363
but this is pushing it, Stan.

01:06:46.431 --> 01:06:48.899
Kowalski, Stafford.

01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:49.955
Sophie?

01:06:50.034 --> 01:06:52.628
The L.A. Office got a call
from Inspector Bethel here.

01:06:52.703 --> 01:06:56.036
He wanted to know the scope
of the FBI's operation on the island.

01:06:56.107 --> 01:06:58.234
Since we don't have
an operation on the island,

01:06:58.309 --> 01:07:00.106
we felt we'd
come here and check it out.

01:07:00.177 --> 01:07:01.644
What's he talking about, Stan?

01:07:01.712 --> 01:07:02.940
Let me explain.

01:07:03.014 --> 01:07:05.505
He's on suspension.
He has been for three months.

01:07:05.583 --> 01:07:06.709
Suspension?

01:07:06.784 --> 01:07:09.378
He was deemed unstable
after he lost Napoleon II.

01:07:09.453 --> 01:07:10.943
You told me
you were here on the case.

01:07:11.022 --> 01:07:12.512
I am here on the case,

01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:16.253
and once I bust this guy,
get reinstated, upped,

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:17.794
these slobs will be saluting me.

01:07:17.862 --> 01:07:19.193
Are you guys dating?

01:07:19.263 --> 01:07:21.163
He's nothing but a suspect to me.

01:07:21.232 --> 01:07:23.860
- Oh, really?
- That's not what these show.

01:07:24.402 --> 01:07:26.165
Your suspect's paying
for this suite.

01:07:26.237 --> 01:07:27.795
And the seaweed body wraps.

01:07:27.872 --> 01:07:29.635
You two look pretty chummy.

01:07:32.209 --> 01:07:34.609
So you lied to me, Stan.

01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:37.512
And you got your
slice of paradise, hmm?

01:07:38.082 --> 01:07:40.209
I hope it was everything
you thought it would be.

01:07:40.284 --> 01:07:41.546
Sophie...

01:07:41.619 --> 01:07:44.850
You might want to do more
of a background check next time

01:07:44.922 --> 01:07:46.513
before you partner up.

01:07:51.528 --> 01:07:54.395
She didn't have to be
so hard on you, you know?

01:07:54.464 --> 01:07:56.091
Storming out like that.

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:58.031
She's got grounds.

01:07:58.134 --> 01:08:01.228
The thing you gotta understand
about us law enforcement types

01:08:01.304 --> 01:08:03.534
is we don't much
appreciate lying.

01:08:03.606 --> 01:08:06.598
Come on, Stan, you fibbed,
maybe withheld a little.

01:08:06.676 --> 01:08:08.166
But lie? Nah.

01:08:09.546 --> 01:08:13.448
You are an FBI agent
working a case.

01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:16.578
You know, when you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so bad.

01:08:16.653 --> 01:08:18.553
I could explain it to her.

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:21.087
What about you?

01:08:21.157 --> 01:08:23.591
You are a hell of a catch.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.094
I've seen the way
you are with Lola.

01:08:26.162 --> 01:08:27.390
You love that girl.

01:08:27.464 --> 01:08:30.091
So you're working out
some personal issues.

01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:32.134
All you need is a little support.

01:08:32.202 --> 01:08:33.362
Exactly.

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:35.801
Hell, I could
make her understand.

01:08:42.644 --> 01:08:45.738
Max can't eat, can't sleep.

01:08:45.814 --> 01:08:47.747
He's like an injured bird.

01:08:47.816 --> 01:08:50.113
Stan's hurt.
He's in pain.

01:08:50.185 --> 01:08:51.948
He's like a wounded dog.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.751
He needs you, Lola.
You're his better half.

01:08:54.823 --> 01:08:56.120
Just give him one more chance.

01:08:56.191 --> 01:08:58.125
He's a good guy, Sophie.

01:08:58.193 --> 01:09:01.594
I'm sure he's a liar,
but that comes with the job.

01:09:02.497 --> 01:09:05.399
I don't know.
This is all a bit strange.

01:09:05.466 --> 01:09:07.196
What do you think, Lola?

01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:09.760
- I don't buy a word of it.
- I'm with you.

01:09:09.837 --> 01:09:11.169
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.571
- Listen, hear us out.
- Come on, one second.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.630
Look...

01:09:15.676 --> 01:09:18.339
Tonight the lies stop.

01:09:18.413 --> 01:09:19.904
He's serious. It's over.

01:09:19.982 --> 01:09:22.678
He's not chasin' it,
and I'm not chasin' him.

01:09:22.751 --> 01:09:26.278
I'm sorry, but I won't believe you
until that ship is gone.

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:28.413
And we still got a few hours
before she sails.

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.685
Look, I can't make
that ship disappear tonight,

01:09:30.759 --> 01:09:32.090
but I can make us disappear.

01:09:32.161 --> 01:09:35.562
- What are you talking about?
- I found a hobby.

01:09:37.497 --> 01:09:39.261
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell me about this.

01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.198
When we come up for air,

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:45.171
that ship will be headed to Paris
and the diamond will be gone forever.

01:10:07.628 --> 01:10:09.493
So, where you taking us?

01:10:09.564 --> 01:10:11.794
We're headed to a hidden reef
where there's rumored to be

01:10:11.866 --> 01:10:14.357
100 million in gold
somewhere among the wreckage.

01:10:15.203 --> 01:10:16.534
You're kidding.

01:10:20.908 --> 01:10:22.671
Look at this.

01:10:22.743 --> 01:10:25.803
Yeah, these ships have
been down here since the '40s,

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.246
but nobody's ever
found any gold.

01:10:28.316 --> 01:10:31.251
Well, maybe with the help
of the FBI we'll get lucky.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.150
My money's on Max.

01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:38.282
100 million four ways...
that's 25 million apiece if we split it.

01:10:42.596 --> 01:10:44.928
Have any idea where to start?

01:10:44.998 --> 01:10:48.729
It could be anywhere down here.
Let's split up, look around.

01:10:50.437 --> 01:10:54.771
You guys sure this is safe?
I'm allergic to shellfish.

01:10:54.841 --> 01:10:58.538
You've got nothing to worry about.
I've seen how you handle sharks.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.434
When we get back,
I'm buying everyone umbrella drinks.

01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:41.184
Hey, little guy,
have you seen any gold down here?

01:11:48.827 --> 01:11:52.558
Hey, Max, I'm counting on you
to make me a rich man.

01:12:33.905 --> 01:12:36.601
Lola, hypothetically speaking,

01:12:36.674 --> 01:12:39.541
what's it like to hold
25 million in your hands?

01:12:40.345 --> 01:12:42.779
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:12:43.581 --> 01:12:44.570
Right.

01:12:59.364 --> 01:13:02.231
- Good night, old-timer.
- Eat shit.

01:13:41.638 --> 01:13:43.401
What the hell is that?

01:13:46.443 --> 01:13:49.105
There is an intruder
in Storage Facility B.

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:51.306
<i>- Attempted break-in in progress.
- Son of a bitch!</i>

01:13:51.381 --> 01:13:53.872
<i>All security
to Storage Facility B.</i>

01:15:17.432 --> 01:15:18.490
<i>Hey. Max.</i>

01:15:21.369 --> 01:15:22.358
What's up?

01:15:22.437 --> 01:15:24.371
Where are you?

01:15:24.439 --> 01:15:26.930
Oh, I'm somewhere inside the ship.

01:15:27.008 --> 01:15:30.307
Oh, yeah, me too.
Thanks, that helps a lot.

01:15:30.378 --> 01:15:33.745
<i>Max, did you say
you were inside the ship?</i>

01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:36.940
Yeah, it's amazing.

01:15:37.018 --> 01:15:40.215
Hmm. Really?
What do you see?

01:15:40.288 --> 01:15:44.156
<i>It's pretty dark.
I think I'm in the captain's quarters.</i>

01:15:44.225 --> 01:15:45.886
That's interesting.

01:15:51.499 --> 01:15:55.560
Max, suddenly I don't feel like
having an umbrella drink.

01:16:07.749 --> 01:16:10.410
I'm beginning to think we're gonna
go home empty-handed.

01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:13.009
Where are you, Max?
I'm gonna come hunt with you a while.

01:16:13.086 --> 01:16:15.350
I'm coming to you.

01:16:16.056 --> 01:16:18.991
How you see me?
I cut the red wire.

01:16:19.059 --> 01:16:23.223
Ah, nice work, genius.
You cut the heating to the Jacuzzi.

01:16:25.532 --> 01:16:28.092
<i>Max. You at the stern?</i>

01:16:30.304 --> 01:16:31.601
<i>Max?</i>

01:16:34.975 --> 01:16:37.637
<i>Stan Lloyd to Max Burdett.
Come in.</i>

01:16:41.482 --> 01:16:44.076
Who'd he think he was,
the Invisible Man?

01:16:47.054 --> 01:16:48.385
Dear God.

01:16:48.455 --> 01:16:50.582
Shit.

01:16:50.657 --> 01:16:52.784
It was a diversion.
Get back to the diamond!

01:16:54.728 --> 01:16:56.753
<i>Max. Where are you?</i>

01:17:03.937 --> 01:17:05.427
Will you answer me?

01:17:05.506 --> 01:17:06.802
<i>Hello!</i>

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:08.170
There!

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:18.240
He's in the vents!
He got the diamond!

01:17:18.317 --> 01:17:19.978
Max, what was that?

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.747
<i>Max!</i>

01:17:21.821 --> 01:17:23.652
I think he left his radio.

01:17:23.723 --> 01:17:26.123
I thought I heard
something else.

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:29.126
<i>Where'd you go?
Is something wrong?</i>

01:17:45.378 --> 01:17:47.346
Nice costume.

01:17:48.614 --> 01:17:50.206
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:17:51.851 --> 01:17:54.376
<i>Party all the time.
Party all the time</i>

01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:56.921
<i>Party all the time</i>

01:17:56.989 --> 01:18:00.083
<i>My girl wants
to party all the time...</i>

01:18:00.159 --> 01:18:02.683
Go back to your cabin, please.

01:18:03.995 --> 01:18:06.088
Aha, there you are!

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:07.426
Hey, Max, come on.

01:18:07.499 --> 01:18:09.694
Last night we were spooning.
Now you're running away?

01:18:10.969 --> 01:18:12.493
<i>Come on!</i>

01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:15.369
Yoo-hoo, Max.

01:18:32.123 --> 01:18:35.149
Oh, I get it.
A little hide-and-seek.

01:18:44.402 --> 01:18:47.496
Like I told you on the boat,
I caught 'em all.

01:18:54.913 --> 01:18:57.677
You're good,
but you're not that good.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.213
You know what they say...
the FBI always gets their man.

01:19:10.628 --> 01:19:12.152
M ax

01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:13.958
I'm having an air problem!

01:19:14.999 --> 01:19:16.830
Stan, are you okay?

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.767
I can't breathe! Help!

01:19:21.772 --> 01:19:23.205
Where are you, Stan?

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.737
I'm coming, Stan.

01:19:27.811 --> 01:19:30.609
It's okay, Stan.
I'm right here.

01:19:30.681 --> 01:19:31.943
Take off your mask.

01:19:32.816 --> 01:19:33.942
I got him, honey.

01:19:34.018 --> 01:19:35.645
I'm right here.

01:19:36.654 --> 01:19:38.554
You're okay, Stan.

01:19:40.824 --> 01:19:42.883
Nothing to worry about, partner.

01:19:48.499 --> 01:19:51.332
I saw my life flash
before my eyes.

01:19:51.402 --> 01:19:53.768
Leave it to me to get
the faulty regulator.

01:19:53.837 --> 01:19:56.304
You know,
I never dove before.

01:19:56.873 --> 01:20:00.036
- I would like to propose a toast.
- What are we celebrating?

01:20:00.877 --> 01:20:01.901
Retirement.

01:20:03.479 --> 01:20:05.174
- I'll drink to that.
- Good.

01:20:09.318 --> 01:20:10.376
Hello.

01:20:12.088 --> 01:20:13.385
What?

01:20:13.456 --> 01:20:14.787
How?

01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:17.752
- What's wrong?
- The diamond's been stolen.

01:20:17.827 --> 01:20:20.762
- What?
- Half an hour ago.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.126
You set us up.

01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:26.395
Come on.

01:20:26.469 --> 01:20:27.936
This whole thing.

01:20:29.005 --> 01:20:31.906
You got your perfect alibi... me.

01:20:31.974 --> 01:20:33.737
Hey.

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:35.573
Get your hands up.

01:20:35.645 --> 01:20:37.510
Are you serious?

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.241
No wonder you just retired.

01:20:39.315 --> 01:20:42.512
You don't have
anything left to steal.

01:20:42.585 --> 01:20:44.280
I've got to get to the ship.

01:20:45.088 --> 01:20:46.350
You couldn't resist, could you?

01:20:46.422 --> 01:20:48.481
You had to screw me
one last time.

01:20:48.558 --> 01:20:51.185
You had to make an ass
out of me!

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.464
Hey, Lola.
Lola, wait.

01:21:10.612 --> 01:21:11.670
Hey.

01:21:16.184 --> 01:21:18.277
You really did save me down there.

01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:29.490
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.
I was only trying to protect you.

01:21:29.564 --> 01:21:30.724
How generous of you.

01:21:30.799 --> 01:21:33.290
You were right, you know.
I couldn't do it without you.

01:21:33.368 --> 01:21:36.963
You gotta admit, though,
the look on Stan's face was sheer poetry.

01:21:37.038 --> 01:21:38.733
Shut up, Max.

01:21:38.807 --> 01:21:39.865
Hey.

01:21:42.077 --> 01:21:43.442
Lola, please.

01:21:44.412 --> 01:21:47.278
Max, I helped you
because I love you.

01:21:47.348 --> 01:21:49.077
But now I'm leaving you.

01:21:56.023 --> 01:21:58.992
Lola, I thought you'd
appreciate how I did it,

01:21:59.059 --> 01:22:02.153
you of all people.
Hey, hey.

01:22:04.431 --> 01:22:07.559
I do.
It was a smart plan, Max.

01:22:07.635 --> 01:22:09.899
You're a great thief.

01:22:10.738 --> 01:22:12.137
But I want a great man.

01:22:19.046 --> 01:22:20.604
Lola.

01:22:23.284 --> 01:22:24.649
Move inside.

01:22:27.221 --> 01:22:29.849
What, you thought this was over?
Turn around!

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:35.060
I tried to deal with you
from an elevated place, man,

01:22:35.129 --> 01:22:37.597
appeal to your intellect,
spit poetry and shit at you.

01:22:37.665 --> 01:22:40.225
But no, man, you had to bring me
down to the gutter.

01:22:40.301 --> 01:22:41.461
Where is the diamond?

01:22:41.535 --> 01:22:44.196
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Oh, she does now.

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.534
You kill my dog,
I'm gonna slay your cat.

01:22:46.606 --> 01:22:48.039
Don't get...

01:22:57.951 --> 01:23:00.419
Nice throw, bitch!

01:23:00.486 --> 01:23:02.113
No!

01:23:07.927 --> 01:23:09.451
Where'd you come from?

01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:51.734
He asked me to help him steal it
a week ago. I turned him down.

01:23:51.803 --> 01:23:53.293
He must have stolen it himself,

01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:56.307
then he came back here
to make sure there were no loose ends.

01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:58.866
So why didn't you come to me,
tell me what they were planning?

01:23:58.944 --> 01:24:00.502
He said he'd kill us.

01:24:00.579 --> 01:24:02.274
You wouldn't have believed him anyway.

01:24:02.347 --> 01:24:04.440
You thought Mooré was
the Second Coming for this island.

01:24:04.516 --> 01:24:06.507
Don't tell me
what I think, woman.

01:24:07.586 --> 01:24:09.952
- Where's the diamond?
- I have no idea.

01:24:10.022 --> 01:24:13.185
- They were trying to frame us.
- Are we finished here?

01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:19.757
You know, I don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

01:24:20.399 --> 01:24:21.627
I know.

01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:41.217
Don't leave.

01:24:44.422 --> 01:24:46.014
Good luck, Max.

01:26:10.473 --> 01:26:11.735
Lola, wait.

01:26:12.175 --> 01:26:13.836
Hear me out.

01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.936
It's not gonna work, Max.
Not this time.

01:26:17.013 --> 01:26:20.505
I know it's too late,
but I finally wrote them. See?

01:26:21.184 --> 01:26:22.412
Lots of words.

01:26:22.485 --> 01:26:25.113
But I don't need to read them
because I know it by heart.

01:26:25.989 --> 01:26:29.856
I've spent my whole life chasing things
which I thought were valuable,

01:26:29.925 --> 01:26:33.326
when the only thing I really cared for
was right in front of me all along.

01:26:35.664 --> 01:26:37.529
You are my heart, Lola.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.330
From this moment on,
you are my only jewel.

01:26:42.137 --> 01:26:45.004
I want a life
filled with sunsets.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:48.703
And I never wanna watch
one of them without you, not ever.

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.514
The first diamond I've ever bought.

01:27:00.823 --> 01:27:04.088
I love you, Lola Cirillo.

01:27:05.894 --> 01:27:07.327
Marry me.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.274
- On one condition.
- Anything.

01:27:20.843 --> 01:27:22.367
I want the receipt.

01:27:32.653 --> 01:27:33.642
Here you go, Luc.

01:27:33.721 --> 01:27:35.279
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:27:35.356 --> 01:27:38.757
Jack on the rocks, with an umbrella.
What the hell, I'm celebrating.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.127
Forget the Jack on the rocks,
let's have remoras all around.

01:27:42.196 --> 01:27:43.686
Remoras all around.

01:27:43.764 --> 01:27:46.164
Stanley, what the hell
are you doing here?

01:27:46.234 --> 01:27:48.828
Well, I thought I'd stick around.

01:27:50.505 --> 01:27:52.666
Oh, yeah, look familiar?

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.072
Treated myself,
maxed out the credit card.

01:27:55.143 --> 01:27:56.701
But it suits me,
don't you think?

01:27:56.777 --> 01:27:59.610
Well, it must take a bite
out of a government salary.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.705
Ah, I can afford it all right.

01:28:02.683 --> 01:28:05.618
Come on, let's sip
our remoras and talk, shall we?

01:28:23.737 --> 01:28:25.728
I thought you said
these things have a kick.

01:28:28.808 --> 01:28:30.469
Luc, what's in this?

01:28:30.544 --> 01:28:33.843
Orange juice, mango juice,
grenadine, and coconut milk.

01:28:35.515 --> 01:28:36.504
No liquor?

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.312
<i>Nada.</i>

01:28:44.024 --> 01:28:46.390
I love these remoras!

01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:48.518
Bartender, give me another!

01:28:54.634 --> 01:28:57.068
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

01:28:58.171 --> 01:29:00.969
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

01:29:01.041 --> 01:29:02.531
- Max.
- Okay.

01:29:10.517 --> 01:29:13.884
You know,
I really like that cove.

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:24.727
Are you okay?
'Cause you don't look too good.

01:29:28.901 --> 01:29:33.395
As an underwater enthusiast, you should
know what a remora really is, Max.

01:29:33.472 --> 01:29:36.498
A remora is
kind of a stowaway,

01:29:36.575 --> 01:29:41.103
a suckerfish that sticks
to the shark's body and feeds off it.

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:42.875
The shark does all the work,

01:29:42.948 --> 01:29:46.145
but the remora gets the spoils.

01:29:58.497 --> 01:29:59.828
You did it, Stan.

01:30:02.635 --> 01:30:04.102
Right from the start.

01:30:05.104 --> 01:30:07.504
It's the only one
you two haven't stolen.

01:30:08.607 --> 01:30:10.006
You set me up.

01:30:10.075 --> 01:30:12.907
I revel in it.
I revel in it!

01:30:18.016 --> 01:30:21.918
Could it be that the great
Max Burdett has finally lost?

01:30:26.057 --> 01:30:27.354
No, I didn't.

01:30:29.294 --> 01:30:30.693
I got Lola.

01:30:32.897 --> 01:30:34.558
Congratulations, Stan.

01:30:43.041 --> 01:30:45.100
I'm looking at it right now.

01:30:45.176 --> 01:30:47.804
My plane takes off
in ten minutes.

01:30:47.879 --> 01:30:51.747
Tomorrow morning the bidding
will start at $30 million,

01:30:51.816 --> 01:30:54.546
and if I were you,
I'd bring cash.

01:31:03.561 --> 01:31:05.495
You win some,
you lose some.

01:31:06.364 --> 01:31:08.456
We still have the sunsets.

01:31:10.634 --> 01:31:11.794
Yeah.

01:31:11.868 --> 01:31:15.167
Don't worry,
one day you'll find a hobby.

01:31:17.674 --> 01:31:21.041
You know,
I think I already have.

01:31:26.516 --> 01:31:28.347
Bye-bye, paradise.

01:31:34.391 --> 01:31:35.380
No.

01:31:37.627 --> 01:31:39.185
No!

01:31:46.737 --> 01:31:48.830
Max!

01:31:48.905 --> 01:31:51.430
No, you bastard!

01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.914
Last time, right, Max?

01:31:58.982 --> 01:32:00.711
Last time.

01:32:01.551 --> 01:32:03.609
You son of a bitch!

01:32:04.353 --> 01:32:05.911
Max!

01:32:05.988 --> 01:32:07.922
If you want it,
come and get it

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.979
I've got it

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:12.350
If you need it,
come and get it

01:32:12.428 --> 01:32:13.417
I've got it

01:32:14.597 --> 01:32:16.827
If you want it,
come and get it

01:32:16.899 --> 01:32:17.991
I've got it

01:32:19.135 --> 01:32:21.160
If you need it,
come and get it

01:32:21.237 --> 01:32:22.226
I've got it

01:32:23.406 --> 01:32:25.840
I'm a pro
when it comes to the getaway

01:32:25.908 --> 01:32:27.876
So don't even
try to follow me

01:32:27.943 --> 01:32:29.843
Bonnie and Clyde,
me and my lady

01:32:29.912 --> 01:32:32.312
Right on down
to the end of the story

01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:34.508
I'm wanted in so many countries

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:36.813
Not even the feds can catch me

01:32:36.886 --> 01:32:38.114
'Cause I am made to run

01:32:38.187 --> 01:32:40.849
In this profession
there is no other like me

01:32:40.923 --> 01:32:43.084
If you want it,
come and get it

01:32:43.159 --> 01:32:44.183
I've got it

01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:47.454
If you need it,
come and get it

01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:48.588
I've got it

01:32:49.765 --> 01:32:51.892
If you want it,
come and get it

01:32:51.967 --> 01:32:53.025
I've got it

01:32:54.203 --> 01:32:56.137
If you need it,
come and get it

01:32:56.205 --> 01:32:57.297
I've got it

01:32:57.373 --> 01:32:58.431
Oh, yeah

01:32:58.507 --> 01:33:00.770
What you think you saw,
you did not see

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:02.935
'Cause it's so easy for me

01:33:03.011 --> 01:33:05.275
To get away
from sharks and security

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:07.405
I love to challenge my ability

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:09.712
So never underestimate me

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.911
I'm versatile with agility

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:14.216
Don't you be surprised
if you lose the prize

01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:16.018
'Cause I've done this before

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:18.058
If you want it,
come and get it

01:33:18.126 --> 01:33:19.252
I've got it

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.487
If you need it,
come and get it

01:33:22.564 --> 01:33:23.553
I've got it

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:24.620
Oh, yeah

01:33:27.135 --> 01:33:29.330
To all the ladies in the dance

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:30.530
To each and every princess

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.729
Yo, confess

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:38.211
I lose all control when I see you
standing there in front of me

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.974
Your style, your clothes, your hair

01:33:40.048 --> 01:33:42.710
Hey, woman, you look so sexy

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.649
The way you wind
and the way you dance

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:47.187
And the way that you
twist and turn your waist

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.450
Leaves me wanting,
leaves me yearning

01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:51.651
Leaves me feeling for a taste

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:56.162
Before the end of the night

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:59.722
I wanna hold you so tight

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.789
So tight

01:34:00.868 --> 01:34:04.326
You know I want you so much

01:34:04.404 --> 01:34:05.393
So much

01:34:05.472 --> 01:34:08.373
And I'm so tempted to touch

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.108
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:14.204
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.613
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:34:16.683 --> 01:34:18.742
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:21.219
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.415
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:25.720
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:34:25.792 --> 01:34:28.090
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:32.624
To all the ladies in the dance

01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:33.927
I'm lookin' at these ladies

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:37.061
Thinkin' about one of them
havin' my babies, huh

01:34:37.137 --> 01:34:38.729
I don't even know your name

01:34:38.805 --> 01:34:41.774
Little woman,
I don't even know your age

01:34:41.842 --> 01:34:43.400
But there's somethin' about you, girl

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:45.502
When I see you winding
in front the stage

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:46.568
I'm talkin' about you

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:48.137
Please forgive me,
please excuse me

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:49.682
But there is nothing else
that a man can do

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:50.774
Excuse me

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.681
I can't help myself, little woman

01:34:52.752 --> 01:34:55.016
I just need to be next to you

01:34:55.087 --> 01:34:58.113
Before the end of the night

01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.589
Before the end of the night, huh

01:34:59.659 --> 01:35:03.186
I wanna hold you so tight

01:35:03.262 --> 01:35:04.251
Wanna hold you

01:35:04.330 --> 01:35:07.265
You know I want you so much

01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:08.595
Want you so much, huh

01:35:08.668 --> 01:35:12.195
And I'm so tempted to touch

01:35:12.271 --> 01:35:13.260
Come on, huh

01:35:13.339 --> 01:35:15.466
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:35:15.541 --> 01:35:17.702
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

01:35:17.777 --> 01:35:20.075
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:35:20.146 --> 01:35:22.205
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

01:35:22.281 --> 01:35:24.579
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:26.743
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

01:35:26.819 --> 01:35:30.118
Na na na-na-na-na na-na

01:35:30.923 --> 01:35:34.859
Na na na-na-na-na na-na

01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:36.690
Yeah

01:35:36.762 --> 01:35:39.822
She's got the touch
I love so much

01:35:39.899 --> 01:35:42.527
That's all I ever wanted

01:35:42.602 --> 01:35:45.503
I'm surely God-blessed

01:35:45.571 --> 01:35:49.563
Uh, under her spell
she had me crushed

01:35:49.641 --> 01:35:52.132
I sworn I was anointed

01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:55.543
Got caught by her magic

01:35:55.614 --> 01:35:59.380
Ah, she had me
drooling for a while

01:35:59.451 --> 01:36:01.351
With her sexual motion

01:36:01.419 --> 01:36:04.183
Like taking candy from a child

01:36:04.255 --> 01:36:06.246
Suck on her love potion

01:36:06.324 --> 01:36:09.555
I can't believe
the changes I've made

01:36:09.628 --> 01:36:12.756
Since I met my baby

01:36:13.431 --> 01:36:17.060
You know,
she drive me crazy

01:36:17.135 --> 01:36:18.659
On and on

01:36:18.737 --> 01:36:21.831
What a beautiful lady

01:36:21.906 --> 01:36:23.669
On and on

01:36:23.742 --> 01:36:26.734
She drives me crazy

01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:28.335
On an on

01:36:28.413 --> 01:36:31.610
And there's no ifs nor maybes,
she goes

01:36:31.683 --> 01:36:33.583
On and on

01:36:33.652 --> 01:36:35.552
Yeah-eah

01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:38.919
Like a volcano she erupt

01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.890
Blowing up my pager

01:36:40.959 --> 01:36:44.086
Every minute, every hour

01:36:44.161 --> 01:36:45.321
Whoo-whoo, yeah

01:36:45.396 --> 01:36:48.456
I realize she likes my stuff

01:36:48.532 --> 01:36:50.966
I chose the right flavor

01:36:51.035 --> 01:36:54.129
This moment I will savor
