Well, that's it. Technically,
I haven't actually met her yet,

12:01.025 --> 12:02.955

My God, you have changed.

Yeah. Finally plucked up
the courage to go online

12:09.432 --> 12:13.201

the very next day.

like that, was it?

12:15.239 --> 12:17.376

It's a scam, mate.

and you're both wrong.

12:22.582 --> 12:25.515

I bet she asked you
for money, didn't she?

-Because it's a bleedin' scam,
you dope.

with your help.
-She's a scam, mate, right?

15:11.150 --> 15:15.549
She's a scam which only lonely

How much did you pay her?

Fifty grand, give or take.

15:18.486 --> 15:21.287

Luckily, you were there
to help me out.

I get the feeling that
this is a bad bleedin' omen.

a ruck after every shift.

She went missing too.

But she eventually turned up
working in some dirty sex club

-Been a while.
-More like five years I reckon.

43:45.463 --> 43:46.729
Russia, wasn't it?

43:47.331 --> 43:51.032
[speaks in Russian] You stole
that dirty politician from here.

43:51.668 --> 43:52.870
I know what it's like.

43:53.439 --> 43:54.503
First come, first served.

43:54.939 --> 43:57.100
Hmm. I've always
respected you, Fallon.

43:57.235 --> 43:58.606
You're a damn good assassin.

43:59.242 --> 44:02.342
But... there was a choice
between killing you...

44:02.978 --> 44:04.315
...or nine million in my bank.

44:05.051 --> 44:08.251
[speaks in Russian] I'm afraid
that's no choice at all.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.515
This one's personal
to me, Freya.

44:11.085 --> 44:13.685
So as a professional courtesy,

44:14.288 --> 44:16.288
I'll need to ask you
to fuck off.

44:17.330 --> 44:18.357
I can't fuck off.

Really nice seeing you again.

<i>Mr. Fallon, do you have my son?</i>

47:54.544 --> 47:56.541
I've got him here. Pretty proper
kicked off back there,

47:56.676 --> 47:59.010
and your entire security team
got wasted.

47:59.513 --> 48:01.551
-Is he okay?
-Oh, he's fine. Yeah.

48:01.686 --> 48:04.016
Apart from the fact
he just decided to swallow
his own watch.

48:04.152 --> 48:07.187
So unless I cut it
out of his guts, he's going
to be a walking target

48:07.323 --> 48:08.892
till he pinches off
his next loaf.

48:09.028 --> 48:10.354
When was the last time
you took a shit?

48:10.489 --> 48:12.555
None of your business,<i> cafone.</i>

48:12.691 --> 48:14.498
Is that my mama?
I want to talk to her.

48:14.633 --> 48:15.358
Mama-- [groans]

48:16.094 --> 48:19.829
I need you to protect my son
at all costs. Do you understand?

48:19.965 --> 48:21.968
Listen, right, I ain't
a fucking babysitter, okay?

48:22.104 --> 48:23.500
I'm a professional killer.

48:23.636 --> 48:25.441
And with all due respect,
Mrs. Zuuzer,

48:25.577 --> 48:28.773
your son is an absolute squats.
Me and him ain't gonna jell.

48:28.908 --> 48:31.946
Mama, this asshole just
punched me in the face. [groans]

48:32.081 --> 48:33.680
You don't need to get along.

48:33.816 --> 48:37.582
You just need to neutralize
the threats and keep him alive.

48:37.718 --> 48:39.983
You're lucky
I don't kill this prick myself.

48:40.419 --> 48:43.720
If you ever want to see
your friend again,
you won't make that mistake.

48:45.361 --> 48:47.895
Bring him back to me
in one piece.

48:48.331 --> 48:51.398
Do we have a deal,
Mr. Accident Man?

48:52.703 --> 48:53.636
All right, fine.

48:53.771 --> 48:55.270
Then it's done.

48:58.374 --> 49:00.444
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

49:00.580 --> 49:03.008
Take me to my mama.
She's the only one
who can protect me.

49:03.143 --> 49:06.445
Listen to me, you idiot.
Your mummy just hired me
to protect you, okay?

49:06.580 --> 49:08.318
-So do as you're fucking told.
-[groans]

49:08.453 --> 49:11.985

Anybody ever
tell you that, yeah?

49:13.752 --> 49:16.389
You like a fucking melted
Ben Affleck.

49:16.524 --> 49:18.258
I'm going to tell my mama
how you treat me.

49:18.394 --> 49:19.690
You're going to pay
for your actions.

49:19.825 --> 49:22.900
She knows exactly
how to treat a man like you.

49:23.036 --> 49:25.533
-And if you strike me one more--
-[grunts]

49:25.902 --> 49:27.001

49:28.734 --> 49:30.203

-Shut up!

-Yeah.

-Well, give it to me.
Come on, let's go.
-Here.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.611

are you doing, you--
-Shut up!

49:53.195 --> 49:55.726
Just take me home, boy.

49:56.595 --> 49:59.868
You call me boy one more time,
I swear to God, I'm gonna
kill you myself, right?

50:00.004 --> 50:02.599
And I'll worry about killing
your old git of a mother
when the time comes.

50:02.735 --> 50:05.104
-You understand?
-Take me to my mama!

56:55.918 --> 56:57.780
with that homing beacon
you swallowed.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.021
[Dante]
I see.

56:59.790 --> 57:01.558
I like what you've done
with the place.

57:06.362 --> 57:07.696
You sit there.

57:12.102 --> 57:13.231
Right.

57:13.867 --> 57:16.099
That is for puke, piss, shit,

57:16.234 --> 57:18.208
whatever else you feel
like pushing out.

57:18.677 --> 57:21.577
Are you insane?
I'm not going in a bucket.

57:21.713 --> 57:23.207
-I have rights.
-You lost your rights

57:23.343 --> 57:26.512
when you decided to swallow
that classic, you dimwit.

57:27.048 --> 57:28.885
And if you think
I'm letting you out of my sight,

57:29.254 --> 57:30.521
you need to think again.

57:32.224 --> 57:35.018
[sighs] So anyway...

57:35.621 --> 57:38.358
...I know your mom might think
it's irrelevant to us, laymen,

57:38.494 --> 57:42.299
but you mind
explaining to me why five
of the world's best assassins

57:42.434 --> 57:44.165
are all lining up
to take you out?

57:45.168 --> 57:48.001

people in some very high places.

57:48.136 --> 57:50.573
Do you think of my mama
ever tell me anything?

57:50.708 --> 57:54.105
She's a tyrant
with thugs and gangsters.

57:54.240 --> 57:55.975
So imagine what it's like
growing up with her.

57:56.111 --> 57:59.008
It's like being raised
by a fucking scorpion.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.481
Well, you think you had it bad?

58:00.883 --> 58:02.379
You haven't got
a clue, mate, right?

58:02.515 --> 58:05.217
Imagine if the bloody Terminator
was your surrogate father.

58:06.053 --> 58:07.724
You don't know
who you're talking about.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.687
All I know is, nobody
who ever crosses my mother,

58:10.822 --> 58:12.492
crosses her twice.

58:12.627 --> 58:14.894
My mother is so mean,

58:15.029 --> 58:18.294
even the Devil
would send her soul back.

58:18.430 --> 58:21.132
-My mother--
-[mocking] My mother-- Shut up!

I hadn't flaming asked.

You are a magnet for psychos.

58:40.525 --> 58:42.723
Oh, I'm a magnet? No, no, no.

58:42.858 --> 58:44.353
I'm not the one
with a GPS signal

58:44.488 --> 58:46.557

mate, that's you.

that they don't get to me.
Otherwise, your friend...

a very long day, okay?

58:56.275 --> 58:58.639
And I don't particularly
want to have to listen
to you blathering on.

You know what? I hear that
your digestive system works

59:01.978 --> 59:04.212

once you're asleep. So...

59:04.681 --> 59:05.914
Maybe you should get some kip.

59:06.583 --> 59:08.283
It's the middle of the day.

59:08.418 --> 59:10.115

Performer of Miracles.

59:48.359 --> 59:49.891
Ah. Oh, right.

59:51.092 --> 59:53.424
It is believed
that back in the day

59:53.559 --> 59:56.765
when Saint Anthony was walking
the streets of Padua,

59:56.900 --> 1:00:00.497
he saw a man
fall from a tall tower.

1:00:01.267 --> 1:00:03.740
Saint Anthony
commanded him to stop...

1:00:04.976 --> 1:00:08.338
...and the man remained
suspended in the air.

1:00:09.073 --> 1:00:11.209
His life was saved.

1:00:12.043 --> 1:00:14.113
That's very interesting.

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:17.714
The reason I'm telling you this

1:00:17.849 --> 1:00:20.051
is that if today

1:00:20.187 --> 1:00:24.327

bespectacled little man,

1:00:24.763 --> 1:00:27.291
were to fall
from a great height,

1:00:27.426 --> 1:00:30.531
I don't know
if Saint Anthony would be around

1:00:30.667 --> 1:00:32.835
to perform such a miracle.

1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:37.906

quite what you mean.

we've lost Dante's signal.

This isn't
very good news for you.

I can respect that.

bring back my boy to me--
-He will.

No. I figured you only
kill people who deserve it.

Oh, yeah, yeah. They, uh,
they definitely all deserved it.

1:02:42.897 --> 1:02:44.835

1:20:04.602 --> 1:20:06.673
I never took a kicking
I didn't learn from.

1:20:06.809 --> 1:20:09.175
[dramatic music continues]

1:20:11.444 --> 1:20:13.113
So why don't we
try that again, yeah?

1:20:14.550 --> 1:20:15.445
Very well.

1:20:27.158 --> 1:20:28.491
Try to keep up this time.

1:20:30.162 --> 1:20:32.902
[both grunting and groaning]

1:20:55.019 --> 1:20:56.117
[exclaims]

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:58.554
[both grunting]

1:21:00.023 --> 1:21:01.293
[groans]

1:21:06.396 --> 1:21:08.938
[both grunting and groaning]

1:21:12.838 --> 1:21:13.976
[groans]

1:21:22.078 --> 1:21:23.513
[groans]

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:28.353
[katana blade swishing]

1:21:29.089 --> 1:21:31.961
[both grunting and groaning]

1:21:35.126 --> 1:21:36.966
[blade clangs]

1:21:37.930 --> 1:21:39.034
Game over,

1:21:39.537 --> 1:21:40.563
Accident Man.

1:21:46.069 --> 1:21:47.174
[groans]

1:21:52.141 --> 1:21:54.176
[panting]

1:21:54.312 --> 1:21:57.085
[footsteps approaching]

1:22:03.090 --> 1:22:04.224
Well, that's enough of that.

1:22:05.561 --> 1:22:06.791
[grunts]

1:22:06.926 --> 1:22:08.063
[gun cocks]

1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:10.296
Ray.

1:22:12.196 --> 1:22:13.728
Ray. [groans]

1:22:16.971 --> 1:22:19.404
[suspenseful music]

1:22:22.109 --> 1:22:24.343
Get out here, you bastard!

1:22:25.776 --> 1:22:28.748
Ray, don't do him, please.
What about Fred?

1:22:29.318 --> 1:22:31.684
What about him?
Collateral damage, eh.

1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:34.784
Just like
the other Oasis members
back in London you murdered.

1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:35.855
[groans]

1:22:35.990 --> 1:22:37.592
Like you give a fuck.

1:22:38.062 --> 1:22:40.258
I said, get out of here,
you little shit.

1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:43.130
Look, I don't blame you
for being pissed off at me.

1:22:43.265 --> 1:22:45.001
-All right? I don't blame you--
-Pissed?

1:22:45.570 --> 1:22:46.393
You ruined me.

1:22:46.796 --> 1:22:48.537
Everything I worked
my whole life for

1:22:48.673 --> 1:22:49.704
gone because of you.

1:22:50.273 --> 1:22:52.300
And once I kill
this little piece of shit,

1:22:52.436 --> 1:22:55.873
I won't need anybody
because I'll have my millions
to keep me company.

1:22:56.008 --> 1:22:56.840
Yeah, maybe.

1:22:56.975 --> 1:22:58.478
[panting]

1:22:58.613 --> 1:23:00.709
You'll still be a miserable
old bastard, won't you?

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:03.617
-Yeah?
-Get out of my way

1:23:03.752 --> 1:23:06.517
or, I swear to God, I will blow
your fucking head apart here.

1:23:06.653 --> 1:23:08.121
No, you won't.
You wouldn't do it in London,

1:23:08.257 --> 1:23:09.550
you're not
gonna do it now, are you?

1:23:09.685 --> 1:23:11.259
-Don't test me, boy.
-Look,

1:23:11.394 --> 1:23:13.024
I'm sorry about
what happened in London, okay?

1:23:13.159 --> 1:23:14.325
I'm sorry about that.

1:23:14.894 --> 1:23:16.828
But you're gonna have to take
some responsibility for that

1:23:16.964 --> 1:23:19.898
because you're the one
that brought me up
since I was a kid.

1:23:20.033 --> 1:23:21.433
Yet you rioted.

1:23:22.403 --> 1:23:24.236
And in the words
of the immortal bard,

1:23:24.372 --> 1:23:25.567
"How sharper
than a serpent's tooth

1:23:25.703 --> 1:23:27.304
is the scorn
of a thankless child."

1:23:27.439 --> 1:23:29.904
Grateful is what you should be.

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.740
-Without me, you'd be nothing.
-No, it's because of you

1:23:32.876 --> 1:23:35.481
that I'm a fucking asshole,
all right?

1:23:36.617 --> 1:23:38.920
It's because of you
that I don't have any mates,

1:23:39.055 --> 1:23:40.617
and I keep people at a distance

1:23:40.752 --> 1:23:42.156
because you brought me up
to not give a shit

1:23:42.291 --> 1:23:43.985
about anyone by myself,
didn't you?

1:23:44.121 --> 1:23:47.492
So the only reason I am
the way I am is because of you.

1:23:49.733 --> 1:23:50.629
And you know what?

1:23:51.098 --> 1:23:52.630
Since I bumped into Fred,

1:23:52.766 --> 1:23:55.236
and I found out what it's
like to, to have a real mate

1:23:55.371 --> 1:23:57.239
in your life, someone
you actually care about,

1:23:57.374 --> 1:24:00.370
it made me realize
that you were full of shit.

1:24:00.505 --> 1:24:02.841
-You what?
-Yeah, you heard.

1:24:02.976 --> 1:24:05.640
You're wrong to think
that having mates around
was bad for you,

1:24:05.776 --> 1:24:07.348
and I was an idiot
to listen to you.

1:24:07.483 --> 1:24:09.416
Oh, no, no, no.
You're an idiot if you don't.

1:24:09.986 --> 1:24:13.080
We're killers, son.
That's where it has to be.
That's what it takes.

1:24:14.550 --> 1:24:17.421
Is it what it takes, though?
Because I know
we're not meant to have

1:24:17.557 --> 1:24:18.961
a moral compass
and all that shit,

1:24:19.096 --> 1:24:20.894
but even killers
need mates, right?

1:24:21.463 --> 1:24:23.660
People that you care about.
You need family.

1:24:23.796 --> 1:24:25.828
You need people
that give a shit about you.

1:24:25.964 --> 1:24:28.303
Because I'll tell you what,
if you don't have that...

1:24:30.007 --> 1:24:33.402
...well, then you're gonna
just be a fucking miserable
old bastard, aren't you?

1:24:33.538 --> 1:24:35.309
-Like you.
-[gun cocks]

1:24:37.278 --> 1:24:38.546
You're not gonna shoot me, Ray?

1:24:38.681 --> 1:24:40.211
[panting]

1:24:40.647 --> 1:24:42.514
And you're not gonna
let Fred die either.

1:24:45.251 --> 1:24:46.683
-[grunts]
-[groans]

1:24:50.155 --> 1:24:51.593
Get out of here.

1:24:51.728 --> 1:24:53.822
[dramatic music]

1:24:59.330 --> 1:25:00.730
[inhales sharply]

1:25:02.368 --> 1:25:05.669
[dramatic music intesifies]

1:25:10.043 --> 1:25:12.412
[gunshots]

1:25:14.114 --> 1:25:16.784
[screams] God!

1:25:16.919 --> 1:25:19.287
[mysterious music]

1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:25.759
Nice speech.

1:25:26.629 --> 1:25:28.692
-How long have you been
working on it?
-[sighs]

1:25:30.568 --> 1:25:31.495
[grunts]

1:25:31.631 --> 1:25:33.466
Since you threw me
out of London.

1:25:36.974 --> 1:25:40.308
Hand over that tracking device
in case there's any more Muppets
after you.

1:25:42.912 --> 1:25:44.246
[palm squishes]

1:25:46.516 --> 1:25:48.481
On second thoughts,
just chuck it out, will you?

1:25:51.953 --> 1:25:53.689
[whimpers]

1:25:53.824 --> 1:25:56.390
[device hisses]

1:25:57.123 --> 1:25:58.088
That was...

1:25:58.891 --> 1:26:01.857
...the only nice gift
my mama ever gave me.

1:26:02.831 --> 1:26:05.432
[sobbing]

1:26:11.776 --> 1:26:12.675
Yeah, I know.

1:26:13.644 --> 1:26:16.476
That's what we have to protect
in order to keep Fred alive.

1:26:17.607 --> 1:26:19.215
What a parlor wank.

1:26:20.883 --> 1:26:21.782
Well...

1:26:22.551 --> 1:26:24.714
...we better get this scrote
back to his mommy

1:26:24.850 --> 1:26:27.784
and get our little
finicky bugger back, eh?

1:26:29.587 --> 1:26:31.590
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

1:26:32.125 --> 1:26:33.922
Yeah. [chuckles]

1:26:36.667 --> 1:26:37.327
Now,

1:26:37.796 --> 1:26:39.664
we can't send you back
to your old dear

1:26:39.799 --> 1:26:41.268
covered in your own shit
and [unintelligible]

1:26:41.404 --> 1:26:43.337
can we now,
you abominable creature?

1:26:43.706 --> 1:26:46.407
Get yourself cleaned up
and put on a fucking suit.

1:26:47.771 --> 1:26:49.641
Oh, no, those are Fred's suits.

1:26:50.946 --> 1:26:51.638
Really?

1:26:51.774 --> 1:26:52.847
[Siu-ling]
Fallon?

1:26:52.982 --> 1:26:54.778
Shit! Siu-ling?

1:26:57.281 --> 1:26:58.386
Siu-ling.

1:26:58.821 --> 1:26:59.717
You okay?

1:27:00.858 --> 1:27:01.987
My head hurts.

1:27:02.456 --> 1:27:03.988
What happened to that<i> pok kai?</i>

1:27:04.124 --> 1:27:04.986
[gasps]

1:27:06.155 --> 1:27:09.496
That's a fucking horror show.
Did you do that?

1:27:10.096 --> 1:27:10.992
Yeah.

1:27:11.902 --> 1:27:13.460
Well, kind of.

1:27:13.596 --> 1:27:16.371
Not bad. Not bad.

1:27:17.239 --> 1:27:18.802
What happened to your face?

1:27:19.405 --> 1:27:21.706
[suspenseful music]

1:27:28.380 --> 1:27:29.180
[car engine stops]

1:27:29.316 --> 1:27:30.918
Be nice to your mom.

1:27:31.054 --> 1:27:32.421
[speaks in Italian]

1:27:33.090 --> 1:27:35.190
My mom is gonna be so angry

1:27:35.326 --> 1:27:37.088
when she finds out
how you treat me.

1:27:37.524 --> 1:27:39.260
You and your assassin friends

1:27:39.396 --> 1:27:41.758
kicking me around
like a fucking football.

1:27:41.893 --> 1:27:43.564
I reckon she'd be
more angry about the fact

1:27:43.699 --> 1:27:46.760
that you shit yourself live
on CCTV, don't you?

1:27:46.896 --> 1:27:48.236
Show her footage, if you want.

1:27:48.372 --> 1:27:50.539
-You wouldn't dare.
-Wouldn't I?

1:27:50.974 --> 1:27:52.207
Anyway, calm down.

1:27:52.343 --> 1:27:53.936
Don't want you
shitting yourself again.

1:27:54.537 --> 1:27:56.972
[dramatic music]

1:28:00.279 --> 1:28:03.151
[Mrs. Zuuzer]
We feared the worst
after we lost the signal.

1:28:04.121 --> 1:28:07.652
Well, your little soldier
was a big boy and, uh,
went potty, didn't you?

1:28:07.788 --> 1:28:10.355
Can you please
do something about him?

1:28:10.490 --> 1:28:12.126
Look at the fucking state of me.

1:28:12.261 --> 1:28:13.527
Since we are here, I presume

1:28:13.662 --> 1:28:16.361
you have taken care
of all our problems.

1:28:16.497 --> 1:28:18.796
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

1:28:18.931 --> 1:28:21.670
<i>-Ciao,</i> Mama.
<i>-Ciao,</i> Dante.

1:28:22.072 --> 1:28:23.639
-Well--
-Mama!

1:28:23.774 --> 1:28:24.839
Tito!

1:28:25.374 --> 1:28:26.901
Another word from you,<i> figlio,</i>

1:28:27.037 --> 1:28:28.775
and I will take care
of you myself.

1:28:28.911 --> 1:28:32.876
I'm sure that nine million euros
would help me with my grief.

1:28:34.345 --> 1:28:35.643
So?

1:28:36.179 --> 1:28:38.716
Well, thanks to me,
he's safe as houses.

1:28:38.852 --> 1:28:40.114
Now, we've got rid
of that tracking device,

1:28:40.249 --> 1:28:43.022
and those assassins
have popped their clogs.

1:28:43.157 --> 1:28:44.125
All of them?

1:28:44.261 --> 1:28:45.620
That one we know about, yeah.

1:28:45.755 --> 1:28:47.061
What about the others?

1:28:47.197 --> 1:28:48.529
I can't worry about things

1:28:48.665 --> 1:28:51.565
we don't know about yet,
can I, you stupid book?

1:28:53.196 --> 1:28:55.804
I have to say
I'm impressed, Mr. Fallon.

1:28:56.740 --> 1:28:59.767
For a man who we only trusted
to crash a car or two,

1:28:59.902 --> 1:29:01.570
you have truly outdone yourself.

1:29:01.706 --> 1:29:03.606
So bravo to you,<i> signore.</i>

1:29:03.741 --> 1:29:05.140
You know what, Mrs. Zuuzer,

1:29:05.275 --> 1:29:08.446
hearing you say that
makes everything worthwhile.

1:29:08.582 --> 1:29:10.945
[chuckles] Sarcasm suits you,

1:29:11.081 --> 1:29:13.451
but your egotism will be
the death of you.

1:29:13.586 --> 1:29:15.090
I'll be sure to see to that

1:29:15.226 --> 1:29:17.925
if I ever see your face again.

1:29:18.294 --> 1:29:19.356
I've heard that one before.

1:29:19.491 --> 1:29:20.825
I do not doubt it.

1:29:22.859 --> 1:29:24.466
How are we doing, Finicky?

1:29:25.100 --> 1:29:25.995
All right, Mike.

1:29:27.070 --> 1:29:28.602
Nice weekend?

1:29:29.535 --> 1:29:30.968
Not really, mate, no.

1:29:31.804 --> 1:29:33.975
So, uh, should we
get on with it?

1:29:34.110 --> 1:29:38.847
[stutters] What, he,
what, he just gets to leave,
does he, huh?

1:29:38.983 --> 1:29:40.546
This fucking ape?

1:29:40.682 --> 1:29:42.846
He, uh, he,
he beat me like a dog.

1:29:42.981 --> 1:29:44.915
He abused me,
threatened to kill me.

1:29:45.051 --> 1:29:46.820
He said some pretty
fucking terrible things

1:29:46.956 --> 1:29:48.820
-about you as well by the wa--
-[Mrs. Zuuzer]<i> Basta!</i>

1:29:49.927 --> 1:29:50.822
<i>Cuccia!</i>

1:29:53.523 --> 1:29:54.727
Come on.

1:29:55.362 --> 1:29:56.128
Come on, Fred.

1:29:56.264 --> 1:29:58.432
[tense music]

1:29:58.568 --> 1:30:00.568
What are you looking at,
you fucking pleb?

1:30:03.404 --> 1:30:04.506
You all right, mate?

1:30:04.941 --> 1:30:05.838
Yeah?

1:30:06.474 --> 1:30:07.870
We'll call it a day, then, yeah?

1:30:08.006 --> 1:30:10.741
We had an agreement,
which I'll honor,

1:30:10.877 --> 1:30:12.948
but show me the respect
I deserve.

1:30:13.083 --> 1:30:14.449
Leave this island,

1:30:14.818 --> 1:30:18.348
and go and play with
your little mishaps elsewhere.

1:30:18.483 --> 1:30:19.752
Be happy to.

1:30:21.421 --> 1:30:22.557
Come on, Fred.

1:30:23.861 --> 1:30:26.354
What? That's it? What,
you're gonna let him walk away?

1:30:27.123 --> 1:30:29.531
Yeah, yeah bye,
you fucking twat!

1:30:34.731 --> 1:30:36.567
[Fred panting]
