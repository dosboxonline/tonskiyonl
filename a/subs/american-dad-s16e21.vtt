WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:06.381
Thanks again for having us over, guys.

00:06.464 --> 00:09.926
Your home is beautiful!
They could shoot pornos here!

00:10.010 --> 00:11.302
They have.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.513
This B-B-Q is the least we can do.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.307
Your son defended Toshi's honor at school!

00:16.433 --> 00:17.851
Oh, it was nothing.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.937
Anyone could've helped him
vandalize that lunch lady's car.

00:26.317 --> 00:30.780
Oh! Oh, Toshi, one of these days,
you'll have to teach me Japanese.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.700
Hideki, my man, I gotta say
I'm lovin' it here!

00:33.992 --> 00:36.786
Your house is gigantic,
your pool is dangerously deep,

00:36.870 --> 00:39.080
and I like how you're wearing
dress shoes and socks

00:39.164 --> 00:40.915
with your Speedo.
Powerful look.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.876
Gonna run to the bathroom.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.420
So you know, this is
a massive sign of respect.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.214
I usually just go in the pool,
even at home.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.342
Especially at home.
When I'm not swimming.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.765
Where's the bathroom?
They have to dump somewhere.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.726
Unless I was supposed
to go in the pool.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.854
Hideki's got an archery range?

01:02.937 --> 01:04.773
Stan, are you
pooping or snooping?

01:05.106 --> 01:07.025
I would, too.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.069
We have a lot
of great stuff!

01:10.528 --> 01:12.322
That's our weekend kitchen.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.242
This room's just an insanely
soft rug to stand barefoot on

01:16.326 --> 01:18.453
while you listen
to the Indigo Girls.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.748
And Triangle Room.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.126
But you have
a triangular room.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.338
Why didn't you put
your triangles in there?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.219
Oh, Stan!

01:34.427 --> 01:37.055
You have truly
created comedy.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.723
Thank you.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.683
You know, a lot of people
don't get my comedy.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.936
For instance,
me right now.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.608
Good morning, USA

01:48.733 --> 01:52.028
I got a feeling that
it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:52.529 --> 01:55.073
The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face

01:55.406 --> 01:58.785
And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race

02:01.746 --> 02:04.833
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:05.166 --> 02:07.210
Good morning, USA

02:07.293 --> 02:08.378
Aah!

02:09.963 --> 02:12.841
Good morning, USA

02:16.970 --> 02:18.972
Damn, someone's blowing up.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.182
Uh, think that's you, Jeff.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.977
"Yo, doggy, wanna join me

02:24.060 --> 02:26.980
"for a one-on-one guys' weekend
out in the country?

02:27.313 --> 02:30.316
"Peace, love, and titties, Klaus."

02:30.400 --> 02:31.943
Um...

02:32.026 --> 02:34.487
Why don't we have a house
like Hideki's?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.322
This place sucks
compared to theirs!

02:36.406 --> 02:38.366
I think it's perfect here, Dad!

02:38.449 --> 02:40.368
I'm just grateful
for everything we have.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.786
Then you're a fool, Steve.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.998
I don't even wanna think about what Hideki
would say about this dump.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.583
Well, you're gonna find out.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.043
I invited him over for dinner
this weekend.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.462
You did what?
Hideki can't come here.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.132
He'll think I'm a loser! Aah!

02:54.215 --> 02:56.801
And look at this wall!
This place is falling apart!

02:57.051 --> 02:58.344
How could you do this to me?

03:00.638 --> 03:03.141
Mother, which day
are the Yoshidas coming?

03:03.224 --> 03:05.977
You see, traditionally,
I take a Sunday stroll, and I...

03:06.060 --> 03:09.564
We all know about
your precious Sunday strolls.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.316
Don't worry. It's Saturday.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.817
Y-e-es!

03:19.073 --> 03:20.992
I'm sorry we got interrupted by...

03:21.409 --> 03:23.203
whatever all that was.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.581
Think over my offer, Jeff.
I'll be in my alcove.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.083
I think you know where it is.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.798
I don't know what to do, babe.

03:35.882 --> 03:39.719
Things tend to get weird when I hang out
with Mr. Klaus unsupervised.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.847
But it'll be really weird
if you tell him you can't go.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.724
He knows you have
nothing going on.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.851
-Everyone knows.
-They do?

03:46.935 --> 03:49.604
That's... flattering!

03:55.360 --> 03:56.945
I'm so screwed!

03:57.028 --> 03:58.988
Hideki's like the coolest guy I know.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.865
I can't entertain him in this shitbox!

04:00.949 --> 04:04.077
But this is an easy fix.
Just go buy some new stuff.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.996
With what money? I'm barely
keeping my head above water.

04:07.163 --> 04:10.166
No, dummy, not real money.
Throw it on a credit card!

04:10.250 --> 04:13.169
That's the beauty of credit.
You buy now, you pay later.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
Or maybe never!

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
I wish I could,
but the credit-card companies

04:16.381 --> 04:19.050
froze me out after I maxed out
12 cards last summer

04:19.133 --> 04:21.511
trying to cut my teeth
on the Funny Car circuit.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.973
Oh. Well, then, yeah,
Hideki's gonna laugh at your clown ass.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.642
Thank you! You get it.
No one else does.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.768
I got Steve down there

04:28.851 --> 04:31.396
telling me everything's "perfect"
when it clearly isn't.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.939
-Such a dick.
-Such a dick.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.691
Easy for him to talk.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.151
He's never had to deal with
financial responsibility.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.946
Right? He's never had to
pay off three credit cards

04:40.029 --> 04:42.782
with seven other credit cards.
He's never had one.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.827
Just letting his virgin credit
sit there like a lazy bum.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.954
And it's that dick's fault
you're in this jam.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.497
He's Toshi's friend.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.082
You're right. Come on.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.167
-We're going to the airport.
-Airport?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.461
Seems odd, but I'm with ya, Stan.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.298
Think we'll see any luggage
while we're there?

05:00.883 --> 05:02.969
Sorry. I got held up at security.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.972
That was expensive tea, and I
wasn't just gonna throw it away.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.515
So, why are we here anyway?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.017
For this.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.352
I thought you couldn't get
credit cards anymore?

05:11.436 --> 05:14.814
I can't. Hi. I'd like to sign up
for a teen credit card.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.900
-My name is Steve Smith.
-Whoa.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.862
Hijacking your son's credit?
Love it!

05:20.987 --> 05:22.822
Hey, did you buy
two boarding passes

05:22.905 --> 05:24.490
just to come get
a credit card here?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.159
You know you can do it online, right?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.953
You can? Oh, my God, I'm ruined!

05:33.958 --> 05:35.501
This is working great!

05:35.585 --> 05:37.628
Why doesn't everyone
steal their son's identity?

05:37.712 --> 05:41.382
Because Instagram makes people
feel like they have to be "good" parents.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.509
So, what do ya think?
Grab a couple lava lamps

05:43.593 --> 05:46.304
and a fat stack of Mad magazines
for the coffee table,

05:46.387 --> 05:48.848
-call it a day?
-Stan, Hideki's fancy.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.518
You need to deck your place out classy
if you want to impress a guy like him.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.813
Y-Yes, yes, of course. Like how?

05:55.938 --> 05:58.066
Well, nothing screams
"I'm a cool rich guy"

05:58.149 --> 05:59.859
like art and crystals.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.612
And, to be honest, crystals are
just a good investment anyway.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.280
They're not just beautiful.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.991
They channel energy,
have healing properties.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.160
They're really magnificent
little objects.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.745
You clearly have a handle on this.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.414
You stay here and buy whatever's
going to impress Hideki.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.541
I'm gonna head back and get
started on the dinner menu.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.335
I'm thinkin' we scampi everything.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.962
Great. But before you go,
watch this cool prank.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.220
-Hey!
-Aah! I got caught!

06:29.180 --> 06:31.015
I'm sorry.
We got off on the wrong foot.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.476
I'm Roger.
How 'bout I buy you a fresh dog?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.773
I get up to
Lake Wittenberg every summer.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.900
It's so sick. You'll see.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.073
And this is the Pig Pen Bar & Grille.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.535
Had some good nights at the Pen
with Perry and the boys.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.703
My local crew, we're like brothers.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.997
Unfortunately, he's away this weekend.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.835
But we'll still kill it.
This place is quaint as hell.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.631
This house
is only 400K.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.218
You know, Jeff,
if you kicked in $399,000,

07:07.301 --> 07:10.304
we'd only need 1K
from another source.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.810
Uh-oh. It sounds like
the Pig Pen is goin' off!

07:18.229 --> 07:19.730
Sorry, private party.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.983
Wait. Is that Perry?

07:22.442 --> 07:26.696
Perry! Ha ha ha ha!
Get your dumb ass over here!

07:27.029 --> 07:30.366
I thought you were gone, bro?
This is great news!

07:30.450 --> 07:33.661
Yeah. Uh, this is actually
my rehearsal dinner.

07:33.744 --> 07:37.248
Smart. I wish I had
a rehearsal for this ice cream.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.377
He's funny.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.006
Y-You're getting married
without your boy Klaus?

07:45.089 --> 07:46.799
We're just having
a small thing.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.260
But I'm like three inches in size.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.304
It doesn't get any smaller than me!

07:51.596 --> 07:53.264
Sorry, man.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.101
This is outrageous. We're boys!

07:57.185 --> 07:58.853
I should be at that wedding.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.022
I should be giving a speech,
saying things like,

08:01.105 --> 08:03.232
"Now that you're married,
your dick is in prison!"

08:03.483 --> 08:05.109
Sorry, Mr. Klaus.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.196
I'm sure he just completely
forgot you existed.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.866
He can't get married without me.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.828
So I guess that means
he won't be getting married.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.500
Oh, hey, since I drove, do you mind
tossing me a few bucks for gas?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.418
Just like $200.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.382
-Think we got enough stuff?
-Stan, we got everything we need.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.886
The crystals are assaulting this place
with good energy as we speak.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.179
Something's different.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.889
Stan, did you get a haircut?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.934
No, it's the decor! I love it, Dad!

08:38.100 --> 08:41.270
Thank you, son.
Someday, it may all belong to you.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.396
That day is today.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.026
You've got this!
And one final charge-up.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.529
You can't be too careful these days.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.493
Hi, guys! Come on in.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.664
What is it, Hideki?

08:59.747 --> 09:03.042
It's just, I... I... I prefer minimalism.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.254
So all this badly hurts my eyes.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.548
Lead me to the dining area.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.718
Mm. So, I have a funny story.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.556
Guess who invited Snot up
to his hotel room last night?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.849
Pete Rose! Yeah.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.977
-So what happened was...
-How's the food, Hideki?

09:21.686 --> 09:25.064
The meat loaf is a bit... stupid.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.484
You mean the... scampi loaf?

09:28.943 --> 09:33.030
Is there anything better than two men
sipping brandy in the master bedroom?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.198
Cigar?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.908
This is the warmest room in the house.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.827
Feel free to take your shirt off.

09:38.202 --> 09:41.455
Thanks for coming.
I hope you had a nice time, Hideki.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.626
Stan, I had... an above-average time.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
Thank you, and goodbye.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

09:50.548 --> 09:52.341
He had
an above-average time!

09:52.425 --> 09:54.594
There used to be a fly in this wine.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.975
Why are we looking for Perry again?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.270
I told you, because we're trying
to find Perry

10:04.353 --> 10:07.565
so I can give him one of these
lightly poisoned IPAs...

10:07.773 --> 10:10.651
not enough to kill him.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.112
Yeah. She's gonna make
a great first wife.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.949
Excuse me. We just want to warm up...

10:17.033 --> 10:18.951
Whaaa... Is that Perry?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.661
Oh, hey, guys.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.705
Is this the dinner
you were rehearsing for?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.999
You're doing great!

10:25.082 --> 10:27.918
This guy's really funny.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.962
Like Mad TV funny.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.757
Hey, Perry, sorry if I
made things awkward earlier.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.468
How about a beer,
as a peace offering?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.346
Got a real fresh one here
for ya! Pssh!

10:38.763 --> 10:41.891
I'll just leave this right next to you,
and, uh... we'll see you around.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.184
Okay, Jeff, let's get out of here!

10:43.267 --> 10:44.852
Yes! We did it!

10:44.935 --> 10:47.104
By the way, I know I gave you
a hard time in the car,

10:47.188 --> 10:49.690
but good call
on packing your wagon.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.152
It was definitely worth
100% of your suitcase space.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.574
He said he had
"an above-average time"!

10:58.658 --> 11:00.409
What a success.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.453
And well done decorating the place.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.539
I wish I could take credit,
but the crystals did the heavy lifting.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.459
Man, you really maximized
the hell out of that credit card.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.336
Credit card? Oh, no, no.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.588
That teen credit card barely
covered the sand painting

11:12.672 --> 11:14.965
of two Victorian chicks sixty-nining.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.885
No, I had to take out
a $50,000 loan from a loan shark

11:17.968 --> 11:19.136
-to buy all that.
-What?

11:19.220 --> 11:21.347
Relax!
We don't have to pay it back.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.349
He made me leave my wallet
as collateral,

11:23.432 --> 11:26.060
but all that was in there was
Steve's stupid credit card!

11:26.143 --> 11:29.438
It's a common name.
They'll never track it back to our Steve.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.566
And you're certain there wasn't
anything else in that wallet?

11:32.650 --> 11:35.778
Yep! I remember moving
everything out to my new Peppa Pig wallet.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.530
Could I have missed something?
Possibly.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.366
I did it super fast while I was
rushing around Six Flags.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.784
But pretty sure I didn't.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.412
I had meth-focus that day.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.872
So I'm supposed to
feel "pretty sure"

11:46.956 --> 11:49.458
that a loan shark
won't come hunting my son?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.419
Nope. Can't do it.
Let's call the guy.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.713
Fine. His name's Mike Donkey.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.881
But I'm telling you,
this really isn't necessary.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.591
Yeah.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.177
-Hi. Mike Donkey?
-Yeah.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.557
I think someone, uh,
stole my wallet and left it with you.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.435
It had a "Steve Smith"
teen credit card in it?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.437
Yep, got it right here.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.189
Been using it to weigh down
the lid on my chameleon tank.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.567
Good, good. So there was
nothing else in there

12:14.650 --> 12:15.860
besides the card, right?

12:16.068 --> 12:17.862
Nope, very light wallet.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.280
Chameleons
are moving it at will.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.866
Oh, thank God! I'll...
I'll just cancel the card.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.033
Thanks for your time!

12:23.117 --> 12:24.493
No, thank you...

12:24.827 --> 12:26.787
Stan Smith, is it?

12:26.871 --> 12:27.955
On Cherry Street?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.583
Because, until right now,
I didn't have enough information

12:30.666 --> 12:32.251
to track this kid down,

12:32.334 --> 12:34.837
but I just ran a search
on your phone number.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.839
I'm gonna guess your wallet
wasn't stolen

12:36.922 --> 12:38.924
and you were thinking of
ditching out on that loan?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.259
But you had to double-check first,

12:40.342 --> 12:43.554
because this kid with your same last name
is someone important to you.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.722
This guy's good!

12:44.972 --> 12:46.640
What is he, your son?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.934
Cousin? Non-blood nephew?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.228
You sound like a guy
with a sibling who adopts.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.813
You know, it doesn't matter.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.899
What does matter is,
somebody's gonna pay me

12:54.982 --> 12:57.610
that 50 grand by 6:00 p.m. tomorrow,

12:57.693 --> 13:00.821
or I'm finding the kid
and breaking his legs.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.492
This is on me.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.535
This probably wouldn't have
happened if I gave you

13:06.619 --> 13:09.330
a tiny crystal to put in your
butthole before the call.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.503
How did I get in this mess?

13:15.586 --> 13:19.381
All I did was whatever it took
to impress my son's friend's cool dad!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.801
Stan, Mike Donkey knows
where you live.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.594
I think the only way out
is to pay him.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.013
But how do we get 50 grand
in less than a day?

13:26.096 --> 13:28.349
Hey, what if we
counterfeit the money?

13:28.432 --> 13:30.935
It doesn't have to be perfect,
just close enough to trick him.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.521
Great thought, but my printer
just crapped out on me.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.107
-I think it's out of ink.
-Damn it!

13:37.191 --> 13:39.485
We need something,
or Steve's legs are toast!

13:39.568 --> 13:42.488
We could probably get 25 grand
for your SUV, right?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.990
What if we sold it,
then went to Atlantic City

13:45.074 --> 13:47.284
and tried to double that money
up at a casino?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.703
And leave my son's
very legs to chance?

13:49.787 --> 13:52.164
Chance? Are you forgetting
we have the power

13:52.248 --> 13:53.874
of the crystals on our side, Stan?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.293
I'm not doubting the crystals
are absolute beasts,

13:56.377 --> 13:58.963
it's just...
maybe there's another way.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.631
Sure, think on it. Take some time.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.759
But we both know we're gonna do this,
so I'm gonna go ahead and pack.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.640
Okay. Let's split up and start
chipping away at separate tables.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.269
We're not gonna win 50 grand
grinding away at five-dollar blackjack.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.187
We gotta go balls to the wall.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.648
I say we go to the room
and charge up with the crystals

14:17.731 --> 14:19.400
until the last
possible minute.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.486
Then we hit the tables at max power
and bet it all on red.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.405
We'll be so juiced, it's gotta hit!

14:25.072 --> 14:26.448
Smart.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.493
-Can you feel 'em working?
-I think so!

14:29.577 --> 14:31.245
Do they make your lower back tighten up?

14:32.746 --> 14:35.416
Oh, yeah, I forgot Jabbawockeez
are performing here.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.918
Hey, if we're just gonna be
sittin' around absorbing energy,

14:38.002 --> 14:39.712
we might as well enjoy
the hotel, right?

14:39.795 --> 14:41.505
-What about the crystals?
-We'll bring 'em with us,

14:41.589 --> 14:42.673
charge up in luxury.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.757
We've earned it!

14:44.842 --> 14:45.885
You're right.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.469
We earned this.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.358
I guarantee they charged up
before the show.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.777
That move's impossible
without crystals.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.947
See ya! Goin' on my Sunday stroll!

15:08.157 --> 15:10.784
I'm gettin' tired of this
Sunday Stroll shit.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.704
Oh, my God, thank you!

15:23.505 --> 15:25.507
Come to me, baby, don't be shy

15:25.591 --> 15:28.010
Don't be shy, don't be shy

15:28.093 --> 15:31.597
Come to me, baby, don't be shy

15:31.889 --> 15:37.603
It was a summer time
that summer high

15:37.686 --> 15:41.190
Oh, what a masterpiece

15:41.523 --> 15:43.275
Hey, boss,

15:43.359 --> 15:45.694
we got the kid's beautiful legs
in our sights.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.572
Don't move on him yet.
They have a little more time.

15:48.739 --> 15:52.284
And I know we're working,
but you don't have to call me "boss."

15:52.368 --> 15:55.162
You can call me "Dad,"
Mike Donkey Jr.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.210
Here we go.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.504
$25,000 on red.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.469
Or maybe black!
Stan, what did you do?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.687
Red! I did it!

16:19.770 --> 16:21.939
Hell yeah!
The power of crystals!

16:22.439 --> 16:23.941
-Mm.
-Mm.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.318
Stan, do we... double down?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.529
The crystals are
clearly working.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.531
It would solve a lot of problems.

16:30.614 --> 16:33.158
I could finally go nuts
in that Men's Wearhouse.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.493
Let's do it!

16:40.749 --> 16:43.669
I'm not even gonna watch,
'cause I know we're gonna win.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.921
We are so charged,
we could fly to the moon.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.256
Ye-ea-eah! Yes!

16:47.339 --> 16:48.632
- Red!
- Yeah!

16:49.174 --> 16:51.135
-Mm.
-Mm. One more?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.679
I mean, they're basically
giving away money at this point.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.763
We gotta, right?

17:04.732 --> 17:07.359
-Yeah! Yes! Yeah!
-Ye-ea-eah!

17:07.443 --> 17:10.779
I can't believe we doubled down
and won five times!

17:11.321 --> 17:12.865
Pull over. I gotta take a leak.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.451
That's the crystals.
They have no patience for toxins.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.414
We only have an hour
to pay the loan shark.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.542
Might have to pee from
the bathroom doorway to save time.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.091
All right, let's go pay this scumbag.

17:35.512 --> 17:39.183
Uh, Roger, does it feel like
the car's riding a little lower to you?

17:39.266 --> 17:42.227
No, it's... always been this way.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.608
It's not my fault, Stan!
Look how huge it is!

17:47.691 --> 17:49.860
I was powerless to its lavender pull!

17:49.943 --> 17:53.072
Roger, how much of our winnings
did you spend?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.407
Just...all of them?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.368
My boy's gonna get
his legs mangled!

17:58.452 --> 18:01.830
I, for one, think Steve's legs
are a small price to pay

18:01.914 --> 18:04.458
for the wonderful weekend
we've shared together!

18:07.294 --> 18:09.505
Any minute now, the wedding
planner is gonna run by,

18:09.588 --> 18:12.800
yelling that the groom's sick
and the wedding's off.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.593
Ooh! It's gonna be so sweet!

18:14.676 --> 18:18.639
I'm sitting extra still,
because if I do, I get s'mores later!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.183
Here we go!

18:21.266 --> 18:23.477
My best man is violently ill!

18:23.685 --> 18:26.188
No, he's not. Y-You are.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.691
I don't know what happened.
He only had one IPA last night.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.444
But the show must go on.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.989
It feels meant to be that
I bumped into you, Klaus.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.157
Would you...

18:38.158 --> 18:40.702
let me borrow Jeff
to be my new best man?

18:40.786 --> 18:43.163
I just love him.
He's so funny.

18:44.873 --> 18:49.378
And now that Perry is married,
his dick is in prison!

18:52.089 --> 18:53.715
That was my joke!

18:53.799 --> 18:58.137
I'll give him credit, it took balls
making it his entire speech, but still.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.722
He's gettin' a poisoned IPA!

19:04.601 --> 19:06.895
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?

19:06.979 --> 19:12.276
These poisoned beers have been
nothing... but... trouble.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.612
I'm gonna call Mike Donkey
and try to get an extension.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.908
Extension denied.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.786
Mr. Donkey, please! Let my boy go!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.538
Break my legs instead!

19:24.621 --> 19:26.874
No, the kid's legs were the deal.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.210
And, unlike you, I honor my deals.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.463
Wait! What if I told you
this giant crystal

19:33.547 --> 19:35.966
is powerful enough
to win any bet we want?

19:36.049 --> 19:38.594
I propose we all go
to Atlantic City,

19:38.677 --> 19:41.138
and we'll win what we owe you, times 10.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.681
Guaranteed.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.644
We're just gonna break the legs.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.731
Come on, guys.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.065
-You can't really...
-Ohh!

19:52.608 --> 19:56.278
Ohh! Ohh!

19:56.403 --> 19:57.446
Hmm.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.573
Yeah, I've never had to
go this route before.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.825
The deal was pay
or get his legs broken.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.744
So, yeah, I guess
we're all square.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.454
Pleasure doing business
with you.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.920
What could have possibly
led to this?

20:15.130 --> 20:16.840
It's all my fault!

20:16.924 --> 20:19.968
If I wasn't so desperate to
impress someone richer than me,

20:20.052 --> 20:22.304
this never would've
snowballed out of control!

20:22.387 --> 20:23.889
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.058
No, it's not! My boy is broken!

20:26.141 --> 20:28.852
This baby's powerful enough
to heal a hundred legs

20:28.936 --> 20:30.145
in mere minutes.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.483
Shh, let the crystal do its job.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.487
It's working.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.531
Your eight brutal weeks
of physical therapy

20:41.615 --> 20:45.494
is working.

20:45.661 --> 20:49.289
I'm doing it! Come on! Stroll with me!

20:58.257 --> 20:59.341
Aah!

20:59.424 --> 21:01.051
Steve, you're doing it!
