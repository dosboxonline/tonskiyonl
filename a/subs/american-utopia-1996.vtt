Thank you for coming.

05:21.255 --> 05:24.047
Thank you for...
Thank you for leaving your homes.

05:25.547 --> 05:27.047
My name's David Byrne.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.214
Thank you.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.464
I can't take any credit for that.

05:32.547 --> 05:34.881
I had no choice in the matter.

05:34.964 --> 05:37.631
I read something,
well, kinda surprising

05:37.714 --> 05:38.964
and amazing the other day.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.756
I read that babies' brains

05:40.839 --> 05:46.339
have hundreds of millions
more neural connections

05:46.422 --> 05:48.047
than we do as adults,

05:48.130 --> 05:49.673
and that as we grow up,

05:49.756 --> 05:52.339
we lose these connections.

05:52.422 --> 05:55.714
So I wondered to myself,
what does this mean?

05:57.297 --> 06:00.464
Does this mean that babies
are smarter than we are

06:01.089 --> 06:03.214
and that as we grow up,

06:03.297 --> 06:05.547
we get stupider and stupider

06:06.339 --> 06:07.589
until we reach a...

06:08.422 --> 06:11.089
a plateau of stupidity?

06:11.172 --> 06:13.881
Which is where most of us are now.

06:13.964 --> 06:14.964
Well...

06:15.047 --> 06:16.547
♪ ♪

06:16.631 --> 06:18.714
What happens is...

06:18.798 --> 06:21.673
we keep the connections
that are useful to us,

06:21.756 --> 06:25.381
and, yes, there's a process
of pruning and elimination,

06:25.464 --> 06:28.214
and we get rid of a lot of the others

06:28.297 --> 06:30.464
until the ones that are left

06:30.547 --> 06:33.756
define who we are as a person,

06:33.839 --> 06:36.214
who we are as people.

06:36.297 --> 06:38.923
They define how we perceive the world,

06:39.005 --> 06:40.255
and the world appears

06:40.339 --> 06:42.547
to make some kinda sense to us.

06:42.631 --> 06:44.798
And maybe round about that time

06:44.881 --> 06:46.881
we start asking ourselves
various questions

06:46.964 --> 06:49.297
like, "Who am I?

06:49.381 --> 06:50.589
"What do I want?

06:50.673 --> 06:52.589
"How do I work this?

06:52.673 --> 06:54.714
"What are those people
doing over there?

06:54.798 --> 06:56.589
"Should I be doing that?

06:56.673 --> 06:58.506
"Are they looking at me?

06:58.589 --> 07:00.047
"Are they like me?

07:00.130 --> 07:02.631
"Should I go over and talk to them?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.506
Huh, maybe not."

07:06.381 --> 07:08.589
Try to figure this out,

07:08.673 --> 07:09.756
wondering if there's,

07:09.839 --> 07:11.589
you know, wondering if
there's a logic to it

07:11.673 --> 07:14.464
and wondering if it's supposed
to make some kinda sense.

21:40.547 --> 21:41.756
There's more.

21:44.631 --> 21:46.798
My friend Brian Eno
suggested that we use

21:46.881 --> 21:50.130
a nonsense poem by a Dada artist

21:50.214 --> 21:52.255
as the lyrics for this next song,

21:52.756 --> 21:54.297
which we did.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.547
I was familiar with
a different Dada artist

21:57.631 --> 22:00.130
who also wrote nonsense poetry.

22:00.214 --> 22:01.964
His name was Kurt Schwitters,

22:02.047 --> 22:05.297
and he recorded one of these in 1932.

22:05.381 --> 22:07.798
It was called the "Ursonate,"

22:07.881 --> 22:10.130
the primeval sonate.

22:10.214 --> 22:11.798
Schwitters and some
of the others in the...

22:11.881 --> 22:14.172
this group were, well...

22:14.255 --> 22:16.506
they were using nonsense to make sense

22:16.589 --> 22:19.172
of a world that didn't make sense.

22:19.255 --> 22:23.464
To help explain a little bit
what that means,

22:23.547 --> 22:26.089
here's a little bit
of the "Ursonate."

22:48.339 --> 22:50.756
It goes on like that for 40 minutes.

22:54.923 --> 22:57.381
It'd be a different kinda movie.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.339
The world they were trying
to make sense of, it...

23:00.422 --> 23:02.005
Yes, it was pretty crazy.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.714
Uh, there had recently
been an economic crash.

23:04.798 --> 23:06.881
Uh, the Nazis were coming to power.

23:06.964 --> 23:08.673
This is 1932,

23:08.756 --> 23:10.756
and quite a few of
the countries they lived in

23:10.839 --> 23:13.464
were sliding into fascism.

23:13.547 --> 23:17.589
The Dada artist Hugo Ball
said that their artistic aims

23:17.673 --> 23:20.047
were to remind the world

23:20.130 --> 23:24.172
that there are people
of different, independent minds

23:24.255 --> 23:27.089
beyond war and nationalism

23:27.172 --> 23:29.381
who live for different ideals.

23:36.714 --> 23:39.798
Hugo Ball wrote the words

Thank you.

31:36.964 --> 31:40.673
In 1976, the band I was in,
Talking Heads, got...

31:40.756 --> 31:42.297
we got a record contract.

31:43.673 --> 31:44.798
Okay...

31:46.047 --> 31:49.756
Thank you. It was a contract
but not for very much money.

31:51.297 --> 31:52.381
I spent some of my money

31:52.464 --> 31:55.005
on a Sony Trinitron color television.

31:55.964 --> 31:58.881
The screen was about that big,

31:58.964 --> 32:02.089
but it was, it was
state-of-the-art in those days.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.422
I must have still been a little bit,

32:04.506 --> 32:05.839
a little bit isolated,

32:05.923 --> 32:08.130
still trying to figure things out,

32:08.214 --> 32:10.881
and I had an idea
that to help with that,

32:10.964 --> 32:12.881
I should watch more TV.

32:14.839 --> 32:19.673
Okay, I saw the TV
as being a kind of window,

32:19.756 --> 32:21.881
and I would see the hopes and dreams

32:21.964 --> 32:26.422
and aspirations and foibles
of my fellow Americans,

32:26.506 --> 32:29.297
and I might learn something
about myself as well,

32:29.923 --> 32:31.547
and maybe,

32:31.631 --> 32:34.464
maybe I'd get some answers
to those questions

32:34.547 --> 32:36.673
that I was asking myself earlier.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.673
And I wondered to myself,

32:41.214 --> 32:45.714
did the TV contain those
millions of lost connections

32:46.798 --> 32:51.631

36:17.756 --> 36:19.923
About a year ago,

36:20.005 --> 36:22.547
I invited a high school choir
in Detroit, Michigan,

36:22.631 --> 36:25.839
to do an interpretation
of this next song.

36:25.923 --> 36:28.172
The song's called
"Everybody's Coming to My House."

36:29.589 --> 36:31.130
Thank you.

36:31.214 --> 36:33.089
And in my version,

36:33.172 --> 36:34.839
and that's the version
you're gonna hear...

36:36.297 --> 36:39.255
It... It kinda sounds like

36:40.172 --> 36:41.923
the singer is not sure how he feels

36:42.005 --> 36:45.339
about everybody
coming over to his house.

36:45.422 --> 36:47.798
And you can sense, although
he never says it in the song,

36:47.881 --> 36:50.172
you can sense that he's thinking,

36:50.255 --> 36:51.506
"When are they gonna leave?"

36:53.297 --> 36:56.964
In contrast, their version...

36:57.047 --> 37:01.047
And this was kind of
a profound thing for me.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.756
They didn't change a single lyric.

37:02.839 --> 37:04.756
They didn't change the melody,

37:04.839 --> 37:08.589
and yet their version has
a completely different meaning.

37:08.673 --> 37:11.255
Their version seems to be
about welcome,

37:11.339 --> 37:14.547
inviting everyone over, inclusion.

37:14.631 --> 37:17.130
I kinda liked their version better,

37:17.214 --> 37:18.964
and I didn't know how they did it.

37:20.089 --> 37:23.005
Unfortunately, I am what I am.

37:31.381 --> 37:33.214

I'm a naturalized citizen.

37:42.673 --> 37:46.047
I... My parents brought me over
from Scotland when I was little.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.589

50:43.464 --> 50:45.339
In 2016, just before the election,

50:45.422 --> 50:47.589
I went to Charlotte, North Carolina,

50:47.673 --> 50:51.547
to encourage people to register
if they weren't registered,

50:51.631 --> 50:54.214
to encourage them to vote
if they were registered.

50:54.297 --> 50:56.881
- The election was in a couple of days.

50:56.964 --> 50:58.422
We do something similar here.

50:58.506 --> 51:01.172
We've partnered with an
organization called HeadCount.

51:01.255 --> 51:03.047
They have a table in the lobby.

51:03.130 --> 51:05.547
They'll register you instantly,

51:05.631 --> 51:07.923
instantly, no matter
what state you're from.

51:09.631 --> 51:12.130
We also did a thing called a pledge.

51:12.214 --> 51:13.547
The pledge consists of a clipboard

51:13.631 --> 51:14.964
and a piece of paper,

51:15.047 --> 51:16.881
and I would go up to people and go,

51:16.964 --> 51:18.506
"Are you gonna vote tomorrow?

51:18.589 --> 51:19.881
"Will you sign this piece of paper

51:19.964 --> 51:21.547
saying that you're
gonna vote tomorrow?"

51:21.631 --> 51:23.255
This is not a legal document.

51:23.339 --> 51:25.923
It was just a piece of paper,

51:26.005 --> 51:28.339
but it's been shown that

51:28.422 --> 51:29.923
when people put their name down,

51:30.005 --> 51:32.881
it was like they'd made
a promise to themselves,

51:33.005 --> 51:34.714
and it increased the odds

51:34.798 --> 51:37.255
that they would actually turn up.

51:37.339 --> 51:39.214
The turnout for that election

51:39.297 --> 51:41.255
was the best it had been in decades.

51:44.381 --> 51:46.756
Fifty-five percent of us
turned out to vote.

51:49.255 --> 51:50.881
Okay.

51:50.964 --> 51:52.547
Local elections are another matter.

51:52.631 --> 51:57.339
Local elections,
the average turnout is 20%.

51:57.422 --> 52:01.130
To give you a visual idea
of what 20% looks like,

52:01.214 --> 52:03.964
here are 20%
of the people in this theater.

52:04.714 --> 52:06.130
Here they are.

52:06.214 --> 52:10.005
These are the ones
that vote in local elections.

52:10.089 --> 52:11.923
The ones up top are waving and laughing

52:12.005 --> 52:14.172
because, well, they just
decided your future

52:14.255 --> 52:15.964
and the future of your children.

52:16.047 --> 52:18.130
But you guys seem to be okay with that.

52:19.964 --> 52:22.255
Here's another
little bit of information.

52:22.339 --> 52:24.839
The average age of
the people who turn out

52:24.923 --> 52:26.547
to vote in local elections,

52:26.631 --> 52:29.756
that 20%, is 57 years of age.

52:30.381 --> 52:32.381
- Whoo!
- Oh!

52:33.130 --> 52:34.255
There we go.

52:36.047 --> 52:37.547
Hey.

52:40.464 --> 52:41.506
Congratulations.

52:43.339 --> 52:45.547
Okay, yeah, but 57?

52:46.422 --> 52:48.005
Climate change, right?

52:48.089 --> 52:49.297
Kids...

52:49.381 --> 52:50.422
you're fucked.

52:51.839 --> 52:54.964
We gotta do better than 20%, really.

52:58.422 --> 53:01.172
Local elections do make a difference.

53:01.255 --> 53:03.631
We gotta do better than 55% too.

Whoo!

56:46.631 --> 56:48.673
Thank you.

56:48.756 --> 56:53.005
In 2018, we toured
a concert version of this show,

56:53.089 --> 56:54.422
and we played a lot of places.

56:54.506 --> 56:56.881
We played San Antonio twice.

56:56.964 --> 56:59.089
So a friend of mine came to the show,

56:59.172 --> 57:00.255
and we were talking backstage,

57:00.339 --> 57:01.923
and he asked me,

57:02.005 --> 57:04.464
"Are you really playing
all that music that we hear,

57:04.547 --> 57:07.714
"or do you have, you know,
playback and tracks

57:07.798 --> 57:09.255
and stuff like that?"

57:09.339 --> 57:11.964
And I said, "I have nothing
against playback and tracks,

57:12.047 --> 57:14.255
"but in this case everything you hear

57:14.339 --> 57:15.673
"coming off the stage

57:15.756 --> 57:18.005
is being played
by this incredible band."

57:27.589 --> 57:28.714
Whoo!

57:45.172 --> 57:48.214
I figured other people were
maybe thinking the same thoughts

57:48.297 --> 57:49.631
as my friend was thinking,

57:49.714 --> 57:52.255
so I've continued to tell this story,

57:52.339 --> 57:54.255
but it's not enough.

57:54.339 --> 57:55.881
Journalists and reporters will...

57:55.964 --> 57:59.422
they email, and would call
my office, and they go,

57:59.506 --> 58:01.714
"I know what he says from the stage,

58:02.214 --> 58:03.422
"but really?

58:03.964 --> 58:05.214
Really?"

58:05.297 --> 58:08.214
So I thought, "Okay, we have
to put this matter to rest."

58:08.297 --> 58:11.005
To do that, I'm gonna
introduce the band,

58:11.089 --> 58:12.673
and as I do so, you're gonna hear

58:12.756 --> 58:14.297

1:11:13.089 --> 1:11:14.255
I realized that,

1:11:14.339 --> 1:11:18.339
well, what we humans like
looking at the most is,

1:11:18.422 --> 1:11:20.339
yeah, other humans.

1:11:20.422 --> 1:11:24.381
More than a bicycle,
more than a beautiful sunset,

1:11:24.464 --> 1:11:27.506
and probably more than
a bag of potato chips.

1:11:28.381 --> 1:11:29.923
So I thought

1:11:30.005 --> 1:11:32.047
about the show, and I wondered,

1:11:32.130 --> 1:11:35.547
"What if we could eliminate
everything from the stage

1:11:35.631 --> 1:11:38.714
"except the stuff
we care about the most?

1:11:38.798 --> 1:11:39.964
What would be left?"

1:11:40.047 --> 1:11:45.547
Well, it would be us, us and you,

The next song was written by

1:24:37.422 --> 1:24:39.464
the actress and singer Janelle Monáe.

1:24:40.589 --> 1:24:42.464
She sang it at
the Women's March in Washington

1:24:42.547 --> 1:24:43.589
a few years ago.

1:24:43.673 --> 1:24:44.923
I was there.

1:24:45.005 --> 1:24:46.464
I wrote to her a little bit afterwards

1:24:46.547 --> 1:24:49.839
and asked what she would
think of a white man

1:24:49.923 --> 1:24:54.506
of a certain age
singing this particular song.

1:24:54.589 --> 1:24:56.506
The reason'll be clear in a minute.

1:24:57.172 --> 1:24:58.547
She loved the idea.

1:24:58.631 --> 1:25:00.381
She said the song is for everyone,

1:25:00.464 --> 1:25:01.589
that it's for humanity.

1:25:05.964 --> 1:25:08.422
It'll be obvious
the song is a protest song.

1:25:08.506 --> 1:25:10.005
It's also a requiem,

1:25:10.089 --> 1:25:13.297
a requiem for lives that have
been senselessly taken.

1:25:13.381 --> 1:25:16.631
I also see the song
as being about possibility,

1:25:16.714 --> 1:25:18.381
the possibility of change,

1:25:18.464 --> 1:25:22.339
not just in
the imperfect world out there

1:25:22.422 --> 1:25:24.130
but in myself, too.

1:25:24.798 --> 1:25:26.339
I also need to change.

The writer James Baldwin said,

1:29:44.839 --> 1:29:46.589
"I still believe

1:29:46.673 --> 1:29:48.798
"that we can do with this country

1:29:48.881 --> 1:29:51.255

not been done before."

of connections in our brains

that got pruned and eliminated

somehow get kind of reestablished,

1:30:26.255 --> 1:30:30.005
only now instead of being in our heads,

1:30:30.089 --> 1:30:33.047
they're between us and other people.
