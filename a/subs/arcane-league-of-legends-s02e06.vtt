19:40.125 --> 19:43.083
[scoffs] Don't sugarcoat it, cupcake.

19:46.791 --> 19:50.125
[Rictus in distance] The routes in and out
of this canyon are being monitored.

19:52.375 --> 19:55.333
No one can come in or out
without being questioned.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.000
[Vi] Who's out there?

20:01.333 --> 20:04.165
We tracked some sort
of new chemweapon down here.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.333
A bloodthirsty murderous beast.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.375
What are you doing here?

20:10.750 --> 20:13.666
Trying to save... my dad.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.874
[Singed] Viktor believes he can save
the man inside the beast.

20:22.875 --> 20:27.540
If he succeeds, I'm afraid the creature's
usefulness will be lost to us.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.875
Then we'll have to force his hand.

20:30.458 --> 20:35.915
I believe I can craft a serum
that will prohibit Viktor's success.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.040
[curtain rustles]

20:37.041 --> 20:38.875
[soldier in distance]
Make sure it's secured.

20:40.666 --> 20:41.958
Yes?

20:42.500 --> 20:43.875
[tense music playing]

20:48.333 --> 20:49.541
It's Vi.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.125
[Vi grunting]

20:54.250 --> 20:56.040
[Vi growls]

20:56.041 --> 20:58.125
[suspenseful music playing]

21:13.458 --> 21:15.666
So much for happy reunions.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.166
Well done, Caitlyn.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.833
[grunts]

21:46.875 --> 21:47.750
It's time.

22:03.916 --> 22:05.999
[soldier 2] We have scouts up now, sir.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.333
Six, collectively.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.458
[grunts]

22:22.541 --> 22:24.665
[munching]

22:24.666 --> 22:27.000
[Jinx] Slippery as an eel.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.332
[footsteps approach]

22:36.333 --> 22:37.916
I knew you could get it.

22:43.541 --> 22:45.916
Had some time to think lately.

22:47.416 --> 22:53.041
Ever since you dropped into my life,
it's like I put on glasses.

22:53.791 --> 22:58.333
Except I can't tell
whether everything's blurry or clear.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.624
Wanna hear a dumb joke?

23:04.625 --> 23:08.457
A sentimental ex-con, a giant furball,

23:08.458 --> 23:13.416
and two of Piltover's most wanted
walk into a weird cult.

23:15.541 --> 23:18.416
And here comes the punch line.

23:21.625 --> 23:22.666
Vi.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.999
You've been quite a curiosity.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.665
One who captured Caitlyn's heart.

23:28.666 --> 23:30.666
I owe you thanks.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.833
Your absence provided a vacuum
I was able to fill.

23:36.541 --> 23:41.165
In other circumstances, I might have
offered you a position in my organization.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.916
Your resilience is undeniable.

23:46.416 --> 23:48.250
Of course, that won't be possible.

23:48.791 --> 23:51.708
You cause too many complications.

23:52.291 --> 23:55.166
Caitlyn must not be distracted.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.791
Don't worry, she's not distracted.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.458
You know, my father taught me about trust.

24:03.250 --> 24:07.166
He told me if I wanted it,
there were three things I needed to do:

24:07.916 --> 24:11.165
Be honest, even if it means
telling a self-righteous windbag

24:11.166 --> 24:13.041
that her breath smells like a cesspool.

24:13.833 --> 24:14.958
Be patient.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.250
Mm, still haven't cracked that one,
but being tied up sure helps.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.250
And the third?

24:22.083 --> 24:25.540
Just shut the fuck up.

24:25.541 --> 24:27.833
[suspenseful music playing]

24:40.958 --> 24:42.832
The fissures are blocked by guard towers.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.415
Patrols circle the commune
at even intervals.

24:45.416 --> 24:49.707
Her personal guard are posted
here, here and here.

24:49.708 --> 24:51.874
They aren't expecting trouble at home.

24:51.875 --> 24:54.165
With flawless timing and luck and...

24:54.166 --> 24:56.291
A big distraction.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.875
[groans, then gasps]

25:05.708 --> 25:07.457
[Caitlyn] <i>Whatever you do,</i>

25:07.458 --> 25:10.041
<i>don't underestimate Ambessa.</i>

25:20.458 --> 25:21.874
[Vi] <i>Vander's in trouble.</i>

25:21.875 --> 25:23.125
<i>I have a plan.</i>

25:23.666 --> 25:25.249
<i>You're not gonna like it.</i>

25:25.250 --> 25:26.791
[grunting]

25:31.541 --> 25:33.958
[Singed gasping]

25:40.750 --> 25:42.416
Hope I was worth your time.

25:54.583 --> 25:55.665
[groans]

25:55.666 --> 25:57.124
[Jayce in echoing voice] <i>I won't...</i>

25:57.125 --> 25:58.332
<i>I won't fail.</i>

25:58.333 --> 26:00.915

26:34.416 --> 26:36.250
[gentle, ethereal music playing]

27:21.500 --> 27:23.625
[music turns haunting]

27:39.208 --> 27:40.291
[Caitlyn] Vi sent me.

27:41.333 --> 27:43.291
I'm going to get you out of here.

27:44.958 --> 27:46.500
[suspenseful music playing]

27:51.458 --> 27:53.541
Ambessa believed in you.

27:55.833 --> 27:58.791
Your death will be a deep cut.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.375
[snickers]

28:08.833 --> 28:11.166
[dramatic techno music playing]

[Warwick growls]

28:49.791 --> 28:51.083
[Warwick growls]

28:56.333 --> 29:00.833
Don't touch my daughter.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.708
[emotional music playing]

29:20.791 --> 29:22.375
[coughing]

29:24.250 --> 29:25.250
You.

30:04.916 --> 30:05.750
[Jayce] <i>I won't fail.</i>

33:01.458 --> 33:02.874
[yelling fades]

33:02.875 --> 33:04.500
[Viktor] <i>I understand now.</i>

33:05.458 --> 33:07.749
<i>The message hidden within the pattern.</i>

33:07.750 --> 33:09.082
[melancholy music playing]

33:09.083 --> 33:12.166
<i>The reason for our failures
in the commune.</i>

33:12.916 --> 33:14.208
<i>The doctor was right.</i>

33:15.541 --> 33:16.875
<i>It's inescapable.</i>

33:18.416 --> 33:19.541
<i>Humanity.</i>

33:21.333 --> 33:23.375
<i>Our very essence.</i>

33:24.708 --> 33:26.041
<i>Our emotions...</i>

33:27.625 --> 33:28.625
