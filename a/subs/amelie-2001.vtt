[ She lives quietly among her colleagues ]
[ and the café's regulars. ]

[ That's Suzanne, the owner. ]

09:37.040 --> 09:39.700

10:23.280 --> 10:24.900
[ All he likes... ]

10:25.000 --> 10:27.833
[ ...is popping bubble wrap. ]

[ And here's Philomène, an air hostess. ]

10:30.280 --> 10:34.060
[ Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue ]
[ when she's away. Philomène likes... ]

[ ...the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles. ]

10:37.000 --> 10:40.910
[ Rodrigue likes overhearing
children's stories. ]

10:42.040 --> 10:45.380
No, thanks, ma'am. I
never work on Sundays.

10:45.480 --> 10:49.940
[ At weekends, Amélie often takes a train ]
[ from the Gare du Nord to see her father. ]

10:50.040 --> 10:53.780
Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

10:53.880 --> 10:56.515
Travel. You've never been away.

10:57.480 --> 11:02.070
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.640
But we couldn't.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.500
Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.875
So now...

11:09.920 --> 11:11.620
Now...

11:11.720 --> 11:14.380
[ Some Friday evenings, ]
[ Amélie goes to the cinema. ]

11:14.480 --> 11:19.750
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.490
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

11:30.400 --> 11:36.350
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.780
[ Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend. ]

11:41.880 --> 11:46.020
[ She tried once or twice, ]
[ but the results were a let-down. ]

11:46.120 --> 11:50.455
[ Instead, she cultivates a taste ]
[ for small pleasures. ]

11:50.800 --> 11:53.140
[ Plunging her hand deep
into a sack of grain. ]

11:53.240 --> 11:55.879
[ Cracking crème brûlée... ]

11:55.920 --> 11:57.920
[ ...with a teaspoon. ]

12:01.640 --> 12:05.295
[ And skimming stones on
the Canal St Martin. ]

12:43.480 --> 12:46.278
[ They call him the Glass Man. ]

12:46.320 --> 12:49.860
[ He was born with bones
as brittle as crystal. ]

12:49.960 --> 12:52.340
[ All his furniture is padded. ]

12:52.360 --> 12:55.500
[ A handshake would be enough ]
[ to crush his fingers. ]

12:55.600 --> 12:58.405
[ He's stayed indoors for 20 years. ]

13:01.640 --> 13:03.580
[ Time has changed nothing. ]

13:03.680 --> 13:05.860
[ Amélie still takes refuge in solitude. ]

13:05.960 --> 13:10.380
[ She amuses herself with silly questions ]
[ about the world below, ]

13:10.480 --> 13:14.900
[ such as: 'How many couples ]
[ are having an orgasm now?' ]

13:24.160 --> 13:26.160
Fifteen.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.940
[ Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997. ]

13:31.040 --> 13:35.511
[ comes the event ]
[ that will change her life for ever. ]

13:35.560 --> 13:39.940
[ Lady Di, Princess of Wales, ]
[ died in a car crash in Paris last night... ]

13:40.040 --> 13:43.794
[ ...with her companion Dodi Al Fayed... ]

14:32.560 --> 14:36.060
[ Only the first man ]
[ to discover Tutankhamen's tomb... ]

14:36.160 --> 14:38.100
[ ...would understand how she felt... ]

14:38.200 --> 14:40.300
[ ...on finding this treasure... ]

14:40.400 --> 14:44.075
[ ...hidden by a little boy 40 years ago. ]

14:49.360 --> 14:51.828
[ On August 31st at 4am, ]

14:51.880 --> 14:54.792
[ Amélie has a dazzling idea. ]

14:54.840 --> 14:58.180
[ Wherever he was, ]
[ she would find the box's owner... ]

14:58.280 --> 15:00.460
[ ...and give him back his treasure. ]

15:00.560 --> 15:05.111
[ If he was touched, ]
[ she'd become a regular do-gooder. ]

15:05.160 --> 15:07.160
[ If not, too bad. ]

15:13.720 --> 15:17.340
The girl from the 5th floor.
We don't see much of you.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.500
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

15:21.600 --> 15:24.745
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.100
No, thanks.
- Come in. Close the door.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.159
Boys? I've known so many.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.260
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.400
I've known so many boys.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.790
When did you come here?
- In '64.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.479
You'll have heard the story.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.636
No, I don't think so.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.680
I'm amazed. Sit down.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.900
My husband worked for
Ladybird Insurance.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.080
It's no secret that he
slept with his secretary.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.100
They used every hotel around.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.780
Not the grotty ones, either.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.077
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

16:05.120 --> 16:06.500
but only on satin.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.420
So my husband swiped from the till.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.380
A little at first, then 50 million.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.631
Off they flew to South America.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
Drink up.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.672
On January 20th 1970,

16:23.720 --> 16:26.029
my doorbell rang.

16:26.080 --> 16:31.180
'Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America.'

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
My life stopped there.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.077
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.839
Poor creature.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.280
See how lovingly...

16:44.320 --> 16:47.125
...he still stares at his master?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.220
One day

16:48.320 --> 16:49.700
I'll read you his letters.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.420
No, don't go.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.875
You can spare five minutes.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.460
He wrote this...

16:55.560 --> 16:57.560
...from the barracks.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.020
'Darling Mado.' That's me.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.660
I'm called Madeleine.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.637
'I can't sleep, can't eat,

17:05.680 --> 17:10.220
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.579
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

17:12.680 --> 17:18.232
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station...

17:18.280 --> 17:21.238
...in her strappy blue dress.'

17:21.280 --> 17:25.615
In brackets: 'The one you think
is too transparent.'

17:33.360 --> 17:35.540
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

17:35.640 --> 17:39.553
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.068
My name's Madeleine Wells.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.078
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.476
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.559
Talk about being born to cry.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.700
About your question...

17:57.800 --> 18:03.033
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.349
Hello, Amélie-mellow.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.780
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.500
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

18:11.600 --> 18:15.380
What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

18:15.480 --> 18:19.220
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.820
[ The 'cretin' is Lucien. ]

18:20.920 --> 18:24.740
[ He's no genius, but Amélie likes him. ]
[ She likes the way... ]

18:24.840 --> 18:27.980
[ ...he handles each endive
like a precious object... ]

18:28.080 --> 18:31.100
[ ...to be treated with care. ]
[ It's his way of showing... ]

18:31.200 --> 18:32.500
[ ...his love of good work. ]

18:32.600 --> 18:33.540
Look at him.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.860
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.520
Don't ask him for currants.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.770
You'd be here till Monday.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.140
Get moving, spastic.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.240
She hasn't got all day.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.036
Here.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.580
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.750
Elephant Mum.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Thank you.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.160
Bredoteau.

19:20.880 --> 19:21.820
Sorry?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.580
It's the name you're after.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.860
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.000
Ignore him. He's senile.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.560
See what he's done to my laurel?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.300
His old job was punching métro tickets.

19:39.400 --> 19:44.340
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes...

19:44.440 --> 19:47.740
...in my laurels.
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life.

19:47.840 --> 19:52.118
We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.153
You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.033
I file everything.
- Like what?

19:59.080 --> 20:03.620
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.089
You were still squeezing
his toothpaste at 15,

20:07.189 --> 20:08.180
so it follows.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.555
Right. Camus...

20:10.600 --> 20:14.380
...2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.940
Got it.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.020
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.700
They were from the Pas de Calais.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.435
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

21:25.520 --> 21:29.685
[ Groping under the photo booth ]
[ is Nino Quincampoix. ]

21:33.240 --> 21:37.711
[ When Amélie lacked playmates, ]
[ Nino had too many. ]

21:48.400 --> 21:53.220
[ Five miles apart, one dreamed ]
[ of having a sister, the other a brother... ]

21:53.320 --> 21:56.040
[ ...to spend all their time with. ]

22:16.040 --> 22:18.040
Hi, Dad.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
A new friend?

22:20.920 --> 22:22.980
No, I've had him for years.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.780
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.758
There. Let's reconcile them.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.040
There. Not bad, eh?

22:38.760 --> 22:43.993
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

22:44.040 --> 22:48.715
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

22:48.800 --> 22:51.140
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

22:51.240 --> 22:54.660
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

22:54.760 --> 22:59.095
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.495
I should varnish him before autumn.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.740
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.840
Breathe in. Hold still.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.420
Better now?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.260
Shut the door.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.360
There's a howling gale.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.220
It's hardly Siberia.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.740
I can see you're not allergic...

23:22.840 --> 23:27.260
...to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.740
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.220
What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.620
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.820
They're good, then?

23:35.920 --> 23:37.980
Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
Not good.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.380
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.278
He's going to drive me berserk.

23:51.320 --> 23:54.860
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.780
Goodbye.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.020
Suzanne.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.900
Suzanne.
- Yes.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.580
'Au gratin' means white sauce, right?

24:02.680 --> 24:04.180
Yes, why?

24:04.280 --> 24:09.115
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.220
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.460
I'd rather cook human flesh.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
You're kidding.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.398
Suzanne, would you mind
if I left early today?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
What's his name?

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
Dominique Bredoteau.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.760
Hello.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.380
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

24:45.480 --> 24:46.740
That's me.

24:46.840 --> 24:48.700
Why?

24:48.800 --> 24:50.800
It's about...

24:51.800 --> 24:52.940
...the petition.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.340
Petition?

24:54.440 --> 24:58.991
Yes. The petition to...

25:00.360 --> 25:02.140
...to canonise Lady Di.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.780
No, thanks.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.880
No.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
sorry to bother you...

25:19.600 --> 25:21.670
Yes?
- Hello.

25:21.720 --> 25:26.260
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.360
Come up. Third floor.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.240
Hello, kitten.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.580
Earl Grey?

25:43.680 --> 25:45.680
Jasmine?

25:45.720 --> 25:48.632
What will you have?

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
I'm working.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.953
There. I'm coming.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.198
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.435
Oh, my poor dear.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.480
You just missed him.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.239
Look, there he goes now.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.320
Bre-to-deau.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.060
Not Bre-do-teau.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.900
You need...

26:32.000 --> 26:35.356
...a glass of mulled wine.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.100
Come in.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.200
Come on in.

26:41.280 --> 26:45.660
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.433
I never go out on the landing.

26:48.480 --> 26:52.314
I'm fussy about who I meet.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.570
They're all creeps anyway.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.468
Come in. Here.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.520
Come in.

27:00.840 --> 27:03.308
They call me the Glass Man,

27:03.360 --> 27:06.796
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

27:07.880 --> 27:12.900
Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.440
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.477
Because it's not 'do', it's 'to'.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.954
Like 'Toto'.
- Thank you.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.180
I love that painting.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.595
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.520
By Renoir.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.908
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.074
The hardest part is the looks.

27:49.120 --> 27:54.900
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.540
They look quite happy there.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.835
They should be.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.940
This year they had hare with morels.

28:02.040 --> 28:05.510
And waffles with jam for the children.

28:05.560 --> 28:10.839
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

28:12.880 --> 28:18.034
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.580
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.433
I put it there...

28:23.480 --> 28:26.880
...so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.154
After all these years,

28:30.200 --> 28:34.352
the only person I still can't capture...

28:34.400 --> 28:36.540
...is the girl with the glass of water.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.020
She's in the middle,

28:38.120 --> 28:40.839
yet she's on the outside.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.055
Maybe she's just different from the others.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.200
In what way?

28:49.200 --> 28:50.500
I don't know.

28:50.600 --> 28:56.295
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.555
Maybe never.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.380
Here.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.268
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
It's for you.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.499
[ Every Tuesday morning, ]

29:13.599 --> 29:16.660
[ Dominique Bretodeau
goes to buy a chicken. ]

29:16.760 --> 29:19.700
[ He usually roasts it ]
[ and has it with sauté potatoes. ]

29:19.800 --> 29:22.900
[ After carving the legs, ]
[ the breast and the wings, ]

29:23.000 --> 29:26.820
[ he loves picking the hot carcass ]
[ with his fingers, ]

29:26.920 --> 29:29.130
[ starting with the oysters. ]

29:31.560 --> 29:35.180
[ But not today. Bretodeau
won't buy a chicken. ]

29:35.280 --> 29:36.620
[ He'll go no further... ]

29:36.720 --> 29:39.270
[ ...than this phone booth here. ]

30:45.800 --> 30:48.997
[ In a flash, it all came back to him. ]

30:49.040 --> 30:53.545
[ Federico Bahamontes ]
[ winning the Tour de France in '59. ]

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
[ Aunt Josette's slips. ]

30:59.440 --> 31:02.398
[ And most of all, that tragic day. ]

31:03.720 --> 31:08.565
[ That tragic day ]
[ when he won all the marbles at break time. ]

31:15.680 --> 31:17.680
Bretodeau.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.720
Bretodeau.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.195
The pinch, Bretodeau.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.705
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

31:39.640 --> 31:41.640
Cognac, please.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.660
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.740
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.140
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.549
It rang and rang.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.190
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.205
I'll have another cognac.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
Life's strange.

32:19.200 --> 32:23.432
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.460
All that's left of your childhood...

32:27.560 --> 32:29.710
...fits in a little box,

32:29.760 --> 32:31.760
a little rusty box.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.874
Have you got kids, miss?

32:41.800 --> 32:45.625
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.300
We haven't spoken for years.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.673
I heard she had a child, a boy.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.800
His name is Lucas.

33:02.120 --> 33:07.305
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.720
Don't you think?

33:16.400 --> 33:20.540
[ Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling ]
[ of complete harmony. ]

33:20.640 --> 33:23.417
[ It's a perfect moment. Soft light, ]

33:23.517 --> 33:27.540
[ a scent in the air, the
quiet murmur of the city, ]

33:27.640 --> 33:30.660
[ She breathes deeply. ]
[ Life seems so simple and clear. ]

33:30.760 --> 33:32.070
[ A surge of love, ]

33:32.170 --> 33:35.995
[ an urge to help mankind
suddenly engulfs her. ]

33:47.240 --> 33:49.754
Let me help you. Step down.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.660
Off we go.
We just passed the drum major's widow.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.580
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.620
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.060
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.060
In the bakery window there are lollipops.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.820
Mmm. Smell that.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.639
They're giving out melon slices.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.034
Sugarplum ice cream.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.580
We're passing the pork butcher.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.940
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.715
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

34:22.719 --> 34:27.060
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.380
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.605
I'll leave you here. Bye.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.815
'She can't relate to other people.'

35:26.160 --> 35:28.913
'She was always a lonely child.'

35:31.760 --> 35:34.593
[ On a sparkling evening in July, ]

35:34.640 --> 35:37.340
[ while on the beaches holidaymakers... ]

35:37.440 --> 35:39.860
[ ...relax in the new-found sun, ]

35:39.960 --> 35:42.340
[ and in Paris the sweltering crowds... ]

35:42.440 --> 35:44.660
[ ...gaze at the first bursts... ]

35:44.760 --> 35:47.260
[ ...of the traditional fireworks, ]
[ Amélie Poulain, ]

35:47.360 --> 35:50.955
[ godmother of outcasts, ]

35:51.000 --> 35:53.389
[ Madonna of the unloved, ]

35:53.440 --> 35:55.460
[ finally succumbs to exhaustion. ]

35:55.560 --> 36:00.111
[ In Paris' grief-stricken streets, ]

36:00.160 --> 36:02.879
[ a vast throng of mourners... ]

36:02.920 --> 36:05.860
[ ...line her funeral route in silence... ]

36:05.960 --> 36:10.805
[ ...with the measureless sorrow ]
[ of newly orphaned children. ]

36:11.240 --> 36:13.220
[ What a strange destiny for one... ]

36:13.320 --> 36:14.620
[ ...who gave her all, ]

36:14.720 --> 36:20.158
[ yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures. ]

36:20.200 --> 36:23.670
[ Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself... ]

36:23.720 --> 36:28.395
[ ...against the grinding windmill ]
[ of all life's miseries. ]

36:38.680 --> 36:40.620
[ It was a losing battle... ]

36:40.720 --> 36:42.580
[ ...that claimed her life too soon. ]

36:42.680 --> 36:44.820

I see you've never known true love.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.788
I did. It shortened my leg.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.552
I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.940
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.980
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.
