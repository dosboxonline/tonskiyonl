WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:08.091
Ugh. So we're just walking
to the plane here?

00:08.174 --> 00:09.843
Where is it? In the 1950s?

00:09.926 --> 00:11.511
I think it's romantic.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.848
And hiking is a romantic version
of being a starving caveman,

00:14.931 --> 00:16.850
but it's all walking, and therefore dumb.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.854
Surprise team-building trip
from our generous new financial backer!

00:20.937 --> 00:23.064
-Ugh, don't remind me.
-Oh, come on.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.483
You're just mad that our generous
new financial backer

00:25.567 --> 00:27.235
-is also your husband.
-Ya think?

00:27.318 --> 00:28.945
Thereby obliterating any division

00:29.029 --> 00:31.072
between your work life
and your personal life,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.366
and radically destabilizing
your relationship.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.910
-Ya… think?
-I do think.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.413
So where do you think
Robert's taking us for team-building?

00:38.496 --> 00:42.292
Probably some godforsaken place
with more militias than total teeth.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.377
I'm thinking Idaho. Or maybe hell.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.087
[chuckles] What's the difference?

00:46.171 --> 00:50.008
-Like your backwoods ass can talk.
-Yeah. Your family tree is a circle.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.885
I told you that in confidence!

00:51.968 --> 00:54.804
Whoa. Wow. What kind of
moonshine-fueled hoedown

00:54.888 --> 00:57.098
you got going on
in your bloodstream right now?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.476
I hate boring-ass flights, team-building,

00:59.559 --> 01:02.020
and most of all,
a third thing I just forgot.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.315
So between the four Bloody Marys
and the sleeping pills,

01:05.398 --> 01:06.816
Mr. Sandman is coming.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.152
-[Robert] Hey, guys!
-Wow.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.989
I chartered this beauty
for our team-building retreat.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.991
And that's when she called
the divorce lawyer.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.284
[laughs] Just kidding.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.495
It cost a lot
to bring this out of storage,

01:18.578 --> 01:20.038
but as your new CFO,

01:20.121 --> 01:22.373
it was worth it
to see the looks on your faces.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.542
We're going to Paris

01:24.626 --> 01:26.044
on that!

01:27.962 --> 01:31.925
The Goldhawk.
If aeronautical engineering is an art,

01:32.008 --> 01:34.969
this is the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:38.848
-Two floors of airborne luxury.
-[hawk screeches]

01:38.932 --> 01:41.518
<i>Relax in our sauna massage area.</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:45.730
-<i>Drop your pet at our dog hotel.</i>
-[dog barks]

01:46.397 --> 01:49.484
<i>Or enjoy our casino.</i>

01:49.567 --> 01:51.903
But a quick note for our return guests.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.697
The pangender brothel
has been closed for legal reasons.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.993
Enjoy your flight on the Goldhawk.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.161
[hawk screeches]

02:00.245 --> 02:01.329
-[Archer] Boo!
-[all booing]

02:01.412 --> 02:04.040
I just found out about that
and I already miss it.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.293
I can't fall asleep and miss this.
Y'all gotta keep me awake.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.419
Don't worry.

02:08.503 --> 02:13.341
I won't let the soft, velvety
embrace of oblivion

02:13.424 --> 02:15.343
caress your mind.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.346
-[snores]
-Drifting, drifting.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.100
-[gasps] Oh, my God! We're going down!
-Come on!

02:22.183 --> 02:23.685
Why are you Satan?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.729
Better to rule in hell
than serve in heaven.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.356
How much money did you waste?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.067
There's no cost too great
to strengthen relationships

02:31.151 --> 02:33.319
and reward the efforts
of my new work family.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.571
Slash real family.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.533
I've been talking with the CloudBeam
Marketing folks, and I hired them.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.786
We're rebranding as a force for good.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.540
Humane causes like the environment.
The Spies with Soul!

02:45.623 --> 02:47.333
You know,
maybe we should listen to Robert.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.376
[both] What?

02:48.459 --> 02:51.004
Look, when you consider the rivers
of shit we've been navigating,

02:51.087 --> 02:53.631
the fact that we saved
the world and no one noticed,

02:53.715 --> 02:55.925
and the festering sinkhole
of our finances,

02:56.009 --> 02:57.677
maybe it's time for something new.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.638
Thank you for keeping
an open mind, Archer.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.892
And if that means suffering
through a luxury flight to Paris,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.185
I'll take that high-end,
whiskey-flavored bullet.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.270
May I?

03:11.107 --> 03:13.818
Cheers to finally taking
the break I deserve.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.279
All right! This is a hijacking!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.740
Everyone remain calm!

03:18.823 --> 03:20.074
[passengers screaming]

03:20.158 --> 03:22.243
Come on. Get in there. Go.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.083
[snoring]

03:29.167 --> 03:31.794
Uh, they probably don't mean that calm.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.669
[sirens wailing]

04:16.005 --> 04:20.385
-Don't even think about it.
-Um, is that plastic? Why is it lukewarm?

04:20.468 --> 04:23.304
It's 3D printed, man, and recyclable.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.765
We don't wanna add
more plastic to landfills.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.184
-Just bodies.
-So you don't compost?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.271
Well, I ordered one of the tubs,
but the shipping got messed up.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.233
[laughs] Okay, everyone,
these are Fisher-Price weapons.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.735
-We have nothing to worry about.
-[gasps]

04:37.819 --> 04:40.029
You actually have loads
to worry about, dude.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.241
The environment is falling to shit,
and you're all at fault!

04:43.324 --> 04:44.409
I recycle.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.953
Three-dollar ties
from Goodwill don't count, Cyril.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.415
Climate change
is a civilization-threatening problem!

04:50.498 --> 04:51.833
In like 1,000 years.

04:51.916 --> 04:56.504
Siberia had multiple days
over 100 degrees this year.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.590
Siberia? Like Siberia, Siberia?

04:59.674 --> 05:02.010
Shit. Someone should
do something about that.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.971
-I know.
-Hey, little piggies, listen up!

05:05.054 --> 05:08.016
We're gonna need each of you
to transfer one million dollars.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.475
to an offshore account,

05:09.559 --> 05:12.687
which we're then gonna use
to further the Earth's cause!

05:12.770 --> 05:16.357
Oh, absolutely, but maybe buy
some actual shoes first,

05:16.441 --> 05:18.860
and probably a toe shaver, Bilbo.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.528
Ow. Worth it.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.780
Hey, go secure the upper level.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.534
All right, nobody panic
and nobody gets hurt.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.869
-[Pam grunts]
-[yelps]

05:27.952 --> 05:31.456
-Hey! [grunts]
-Block it. Whatever you can find.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.211
And now, we set it on fire.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.465
We're on a plane. Where would we go?

05:40.548 --> 05:42.592
You just said it. We're on a plane.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.385
-We could fly anywhere.
-[chuckles]

05:44.469 --> 05:47.680
If your brain were a drug,
I'd snort the shit out of it.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.266
Welp, I guess
there's only one thing to do.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.685
-Experience everything good…
-Break in, rewire the control panel…

05:52.769 --> 05:54.687
-…before it's too late.
-…into a weapon and-- What?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.689
I'm talking first
we hit the grill. Meat fix.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.609
Then we rake up a fortune
at the slots and blackjack.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.527
Then get absolutely blitzed.

06:01.611 --> 06:05.114
-But what about the hijackers?
-[groans] Is that still going on?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.824
Look, either they kill us,

06:06.908 --> 06:09.285
law enforcement storms
the plane and they kill us,

06:09.368 --> 06:10.995
or everything works out fine.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.914
But in all those cases, isn't it better

06:12.997 --> 06:15.291
if we experience as much
as we can while we can?

06:18.252 --> 06:20.546
Hell yeah! My new best friend.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.052
Welcome to the Republic of Pamistan,

06:26.135 --> 06:28.679
where the only rule is… [grunting]

06:28.763 --> 06:32.558
…screw the rules, and anything else
you can get your hands on.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.895
Huh. Why not? When are we ever
gonna be on a plane like this again?

06:35.978 --> 06:37.980
Speak for yourself.
My family has season tickets.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.232
For the plane?

06:39.315 --> 06:41.734
And when is flying season?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.242
You can't keep a bunch of people hostage

06:49.325 --> 06:51.410
if you're not keeping them hostage.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.914
And don't hijackers usually wait
until the plane is in the sky?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.750
Where, historically,
there are fewer SWAT teams?

06:57.834 --> 07:01.254
Well, they lock the doors to the cockpit
once the pilots are in and--

07:01.337 --> 07:04.257
You don't know how to breach that
because you're amateurs. Wow.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.259
Shut up. Why would I listen to a captive?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.302
Well, you're at the point
of no return here.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.347
Soon you'll have to shoot people,
and I don't think you want that,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.932
other than maybe that guy.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.016
Oh, yeah?

07:14.100 --> 07:18.020
Well, every fish you eat is loaded
with plastic micro-beads from face soap!

07:18.104 --> 07:20.690
Kind of getting a last scene
of <i>Scarface</i> vibe from this guy,

07:20.773 --> 07:22.400
but with gluten-free cocaine.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.985
Okay. What's your suggestion?

07:24.068 --> 07:26.863
Well, anytime you need
to make an example out of someone,

07:26.946 --> 07:28.990
maybe knock this guy around a little bit.

07:29.073 --> 07:32.118
I don't know.
Feels like clubbing a baby seal.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.120
I'd hate to hit him
if he doesn't deserve it.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.331
That's the point. If he gets hit,
it could happen to anyone else.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.585
And let me tell you a secret.
He's secretly a masochist.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.420
Gets pleasure from being beaten up.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.338
He loves it. Can't get enough of it.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.090
You'd be doing this guy a favor.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.260
-All right. That's a load off my mind.
-Yeah. Mine too.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.847
[sighs] Things have calmed down
a bit outside.

07:52.930 --> 07:56.934
-We'll be fine until we figure out a plan.
-Ugh, smells like a kennel in here.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.896
I can't believe this.
Robert, this was such a bad idea.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.149
I was supposed to somehow predict
that we'd be hijacked?

08:03.232 --> 08:06.736
No. It's just working with you
just makes everything so complicated.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.239
I would have known that's how you felt
if you had talked to me

08:10.323 --> 08:12.116
instead of hanging up on me.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
[woman] <i>Now, take a deep breath</i>

08:14.202 --> 08:16.913
<i>and feel the gratitude</i>
<i>for your surroundings.</i>

08:16.996 --> 08:19.207
Would you turn that off?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.501
[steam hissing]

08:21.584 --> 08:22.919
Goddamn it.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.717
Cyril. Hey, Cyril, take this.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.011
Why do I need an earpiece?
Where are you going?

08:32.094 --> 08:35.306
I need you to be useful for the first time
in your entire life, Cyril.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.642
When I make my move,
you have to be my eyes and ears.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.851
Why? What are you doing?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.395
This is one of those situations
where it plays out better

08:41.479 --> 08:43.940
if we don't get violent
and just submit to their guidance.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.568
Hey, Chatty Cathy, no talking!
Yeah, that's right.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.404
Anyone else gets out of line,
they're next!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.532
-Hey, thanks.
-Hey, my pleasure.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.034
Just keep them under control
and we can get out of here

08:55.117 --> 08:58.621
without anyone getting too hurt,
other than Cyril, which hardly counts.

08:59.247 --> 09:04.001
Don't you dare open
that single-use plastic bottle!

09:04.085 --> 09:07.380
Trust me, I don't like drinking water
that isn't alkaline either,

09:07.463 --> 09:10.883
but you all have truly
pushed me over the edge.

09:10.967 --> 09:11.968
-Ah!
-[passengers gasp]

09:12.051 --> 09:13.219
Goddamn it!

09:13.302 --> 09:15.263
Well, at least you had a good reason.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.347
[wincing]

09:17.473 --> 09:20.351
[all screaming]

09:22.562 --> 09:24.188
[guns cocking]

09:25.731 --> 09:29.026
God, Ray's gonna be so pissed
when he finds out he missed this.

09:29.110 --> 09:33.197
And now I'll get an allergic reaction
from this fake croc-skin belt?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.533
Who knows which is gonna kill me first?

09:35.616 --> 09:36.617
[grunts]

09:36.701 --> 09:38.953
Thank you, but also,
what the hell are you doing?

09:39.036 --> 09:41.622
Stopping the poisoning of the earth
is worth a little blood!

09:41.706 --> 09:44.542
-Plus, you told us to keep control!
-Does this look controlled to you?

09:44.625 --> 09:45.626
You tell me.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.877
-[clatters]
-Damn it.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.047
It's possible that recycled guns
weren't the best move.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.800
They're not recycled. They're recyclable!

09:52.883 --> 09:53.968
[grunts]

09:54.927 --> 09:56.137
[crash]

09:56.220 --> 09:58.055
-[Archer] <i>Okay, Cyril, can you hear me?</i>
-Yes!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.349
-Quiet!
-[groans] Damn it.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.810
[Archer laughs]
<i>Oh, man. I knew that would happen.</i>

10:02.893 --> 10:04.645
<i>I'm so mad I missed it.</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:06.731
You can't let them know
you're talking to me,

10:06.814 --> 10:08.983
but you've got to be my eyes
in the passenger cabin.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.901
I'm heading low, and if my guess is right,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.821
Pam and Krieger are cooking up
something good on the upper level.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.324
Look, they don't know
what they're talking about.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.492
You gotta follow your dream, man.
What is it?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.328
Slam poetry.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.289
Oh, man. Forget I said any of that shit.

10:23.372 --> 10:27.168
Might I remind you, there is still
a hostage crisis downstairs.

10:27.251 --> 10:30.796
[gasps] Oh, no!
Does that affect how the grill works?

10:30.880 --> 10:31.964
No, ma'am.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.010
Okay, Cyril,
I seem to have reached the cargo hold,

10:36.093 --> 10:37.970
<i>but it'll be impossible to find our bags.</i>

10:38.054 --> 10:41.098
<i>So I'll just steal all the jewelry</i>
<i>from these and then retire.</i>

10:41.182 --> 10:44.810
-Probably alphabetical.
-Damn it. You ruin everything.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.398
I still can't believe they made Krieger
check the new tacticane,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.902
but these assholes can bring an endless
supply of plastic guns on board.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.196
I love crosswords.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.323
What was the clue for alphabetical again?

10:57.406 --> 10:59.867
Oh. Yeah. It was a tough one.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.869
Having to do with the…

11:01.952 --> 11:03.371
-alphabet?
-[phone rings]

11:03.454 --> 11:05.414
Yes. Flight 4643, Goldhawk.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.458
This is Flight Attendant Eryn.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.044
It's for you. It's the hostage negotiator.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.254
Don't worry. They'll slow play this.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.589
-Hell--
-[negotiator] <i>Okay. Shut up.</i>

11:13.672 --> 11:16.133
I don't care who you are.
I don't care what you want.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
Right now, I am smiling.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.846
I'm giving my boss the thumbs up
like things are going great.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.681
But when push immediately comes to shove,

11:22.765 --> 11:24.809
we're gonna come in there
and kill you all.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.395
And if a few hostages get hit,
them's the breaks.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.522
And I am gonna like it!

11:29.605 --> 11:31.899
Then tomorrow, I'm gonna go
looking for your families,

11:31.982 --> 11:33.484
your friends and your pets.

11:33.567 --> 11:37.321
So enjoy your last moments on earth,
you barely human scum!

11:40.199 --> 11:42.201
So,

11:42.284 --> 11:43.661
how's the divorce going?

11:44.161 --> 11:45.663
Okay, time to accelerate.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.456
We have to find Target One now.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.584
There was a passenger acting weird.
I bet he knows something.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.752
And he's gone!

11:51.836 --> 11:53.587
He definitely knows something!

11:53.671 --> 11:57.508
Okay, fan out!
Remember this is Target Alpha.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.759
Uh-oh.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.428
Oh. Well then, problem solved.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.306
Considering he didn't even tell me about
purchasing the company in the first place.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.100
I called you to talk about it.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.102
I was on a mission.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.438
Your job was in jeopardy
of being taken away.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.857
I just wanted to help
for the betterment of our family.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.152
Yes, but now you run
the company that pays me, Robert.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.780
-We run a business.
-Oh-ho, sure. Right into the ground.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.575
-We saved the world.
-Fat lot of good it did you.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.619
Before I bought the place,
I saw you mix tequila and vodka

12:25.703 --> 12:27.955
out of the bottom of two plastic bottles.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.081
Oh, shut up.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.085
Whatever you're doing,
please do it faster.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.672
It's getting pretty hairy.
Archer, did they get you?

12:36.755 --> 12:39.842
Yeah. It's pretty hairy here too, Cyril.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.135
[laughs]

12:41.218 --> 12:42.219
Just hang tight.

12:44.221 --> 12:47.725
Uh. It sounds like they're really
on the hunt for Robert and his cash.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.268
<i>How rich could this guy be?</i>

12:49.351 --> 12:51.520
He had the spare change
to buy the entire agency,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.481
as what was probably a favor to Lana.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.442
<i>There's no way our shitty little</i>
<i>Mom-and-Pop agency cost that much.</i>

12:56.525 --> 12:59.069
When was the last time you bought a drink
without expensing it?

12:59.987 --> 13:02.656
-I wanna say high school?
-[barks]

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
Huh. Oh. Hey.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.996
I was just looking for my, uh--

13:09.079 --> 13:10.080
No.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.666
-Well, did you find it?
-[groans]

13:13.501 --> 13:15.669
-[Archer] <i>Cyril? Cyril?</i>
-[dogs barking]

13:15.753 --> 13:17.338
<i>Ah. You idiot.</i>

13:18.005 --> 13:19.882
<i>Hey, come here. That's a good boy.</i>

13:19.965 --> 13:22.092
<i>You guys be good till I get back, okay?</i>

13:22.176 --> 13:23.802
<i>Love you guys.</i>

13:25.304 --> 13:26.680
Psst. Stewardess.

13:26.764 --> 13:30.267
Hey, is there any way to get
to the top floor other than the stairs?

13:31.018 --> 13:33.771
Also, we're probably gonna die
in ten minutes,

13:33.854 --> 13:35.731
so what do you think?

13:37.066 --> 13:38.901
Hey, you sicko. Where's the bald guy?

13:38.984 --> 13:40.236
Robert? I mean, who?

13:40.819 --> 13:42.655
[groans] I don't know.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.324
[grunts] Nope, that didn't help.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.659
Enough with the games!

13:46.742 --> 13:50.079
Every moment I don't shoot one of you
is another dead whale!

13:50.162 --> 13:52.164
Uh. That doesn't make any sense.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.832
Neither does talking right then.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.253
So now you're gonna transfer
one million dollars into our account!

14:01.465 --> 14:03.259
Hey, I gotta tell you
that's the first time

14:03.342 --> 14:05.844
that line worked for me.
And I've tried it a bunch.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.973
By the way, I'm a flight attendant,
not a stewardess.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.808
Definitely the priority right now.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.811
Okay, Flight Attendant, can you show me
the way to the second floor?

14:15.396 --> 14:19.108
Wow, you sure know your way
around a shaft. Wait. No, I'm sorry.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.068
That was coarse. I apologize.

14:21.151 --> 14:26.073
-Hmm. Looks like a tight fit.
-Damn it. That one's better.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.492
I think there's a whole lot
you're not telling me.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.120
First, I don't know about the agency.
What's next?

14:31.203 --> 14:33.831
-You guys should really be quiet.
-Good point.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.916
What's next is you're fighting with me

14:36.000 --> 14:39.670
because I wanna have a baby with you
and you won't talk about it.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.006
-[laughing]
-Robert, they're looking for you.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.757
You never wanna talk about it.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.010
You like to run around saving the world,

14:46.093 --> 14:48.762
when I want to build a world of our own.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.974
But you keep pretending
you're not a mother.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.602
And with two kids,
that would be twice as hard.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.769
[sighs]

14:57.271 --> 14:58.272
He's in there.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.074
You know that grater thing
that servants use for grating nutmeg?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.285
Do you ever wanna use that
on someone's nipples?

15:11.368 --> 15:13.078
Just really go to town?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.955
I don't like that town.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.625
[groans] Oh, my God.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.045
I had eight shots and 12 steaks.

15:21.128 --> 15:25.007
And it was such a good idea.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.091
What the shit?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.177
[splutters] Wait, have you been there
the whole time?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.847
Because if so, all that shit I was talking
was about a different Archer

15:31.931 --> 15:33.807
who does all the same shit you do.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.559
Guys, the hijackers have Robert.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.604
Apparently, their whole objective
was just to drain his bank account.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.899
-Wait. How do you know all that?
-I gave the flight attendant an earpiece.

15:41.982 --> 15:42.983
After we had sex.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.985
-Come on, dude.
-Oh, come on. That is bad.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.070
Tell me about it.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.364
I can't believe they didn't
wanna use me as a hostage.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
Am I not rich enough for them?

15:50.532 --> 15:52.576
Does that make me any less of a person?

15:52.660 --> 15:56.038
-Like, less than you are currently?
-Also, you're really rich.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.915
Your family owns six islands,

15:57.998 --> 16:01.293
and the private prison-slash-hunting
preserves on those islands.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.629
Aw, thanks, guys. You're right.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.799
I am worthy of being horribly harmed
and discarded by bad people.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.802
Guys, if we could get back
to the hostage situation that's ongoing--

16:09.885 --> 16:13.055
Wish I could, bud, but here in Pamistan,
we rise above it.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.264
No rules.

16:14.348 --> 16:18.227
Right. And I'm about to prove you
all wrong about slam poetry.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.397
Fine. We'll do it.
Wait, I have the perfect line.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.149
Let's compost these turds.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.194
-And that was it?
-You dick.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.489
-You don't have to do this.
-Enough! Just shut up and pay up!

16:30.572 --> 16:33.867
Ten million bucks
or you won't be as lucky as he was.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.786
-[groans]
-He doesn't look that lucky.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.875
Okay. The transfer is done.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.877
Wait, I'm not seeing
the transfer in our account.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.672
You don't have to bully people
into giving you money

16:46.755 --> 16:49.550
when you can just make
an effective case for change.

16:49.633 --> 16:53.679
Okay, but to be clear,
you just gave a huge amount of money

16:53.762 --> 16:56.849
to Citizens of the World
environmental group?

16:56.932 --> 16:57.933
-What?
-Look.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.769
In the heat of the moment,
we all say or do things

17:00.853 --> 17:02.980
that hurt the things we're trying to save.

17:03.063 --> 17:07.276
But there's still a chance for us
to come together and find a way to change.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.362
-[grunts]
-Nice try!

17:10.446 --> 17:11.864
But that's not what I asked for.

17:11.947 --> 17:14.867
Also, that seemed
more applicable to a relationship!

17:14.950 --> 17:17.453
Where was that advice last year
when I needed it?

17:21.165 --> 17:22.875
Release the hounds!

17:22.958 --> 17:25.878
[dogs barking]

17:30.924 --> 17:33.969
-Come on! Hit me with the cherries!
-[machine chiming]

17:34.053 --> 17:35.637
[shouts]

17:37.973 --> 17:40.017
You know what?
This is different than I thought.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.144
So I'm just gonna go-- [grunts]

17:42.227 --> 17:43.479
[Archer] Oh!

17:43.562 --> 17:45.481
Maybe the recycled guns do work.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.566
-Archer, help!
-Shut up!

17:47.649 --> 17:49.902
And why does the stewardess
know your name?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.738
Her name isn't "Stewardess," Lana.
It's Flight Attendant.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.947
-Really?
-What?

17:54.031 --> 17:56.700
My stewardess line finally worked.
What can I say?

17:56.784 --> 18:00.954
-Actually, it's Eryn, with a "y."
-Shut up! I'm gonna hurt this stewardess.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.041
-Now you're just doing it intentionally.
-Uh-uh. I mean it.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.834
I'm gonna hurt her real bad.

18:05.918 --> 18:10.130
Like, nasty bad to make a point about,
you know, all the stuff.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.632
And then I'm gonna fly this plane

18:11.715 --> 18:12.966
-the hell out of here.
-[screams]

18:15.427 --> 18:16.720
Come on, hurry up.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.388
[grunting]

18:20.557 --> 18:21.767
Ow!

18:21.850 --> 18:24.353
What the hell is happening around here?

18:24.436 --> 18:28.148
-Oh, my God. Are we in Paris?
-No, but I see France.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.858
-Seriously? How old are you?
-[laughing]

18:29.942 --> 18:33.821
Apparently not too old to piss myself
laughing at your ass.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.240
I don't need this. Don't need it.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.952
[gasps]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.290
[shouts]

18:45.374 --> 18:47.876
Screw you, Miranda!

18:47.960 --> 18:52.506
And that judge that gave you
my sword collection. Ah!

18:54.716 --> 18:57.052
I gotta go, guys. Love you all.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.556
Hey, you were actually
really brave back there.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.975
-You mean after you tried to kill me?
-Oh, come on.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.811
-I didn't try to kill you. I just--
-Aided and abetted.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.314
But I should not have said that.
It was the steam and the stress--

19:09.398 --> 19:11.233
-And the hijackers.
-Them too.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.779
I really want us to work.
I wanna share everything with you.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.032
But if you're not ready
for another baby, I understand.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.870
Thank you, Robert, but it's not gonna
be easy for me to forget what you said.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.123
Oh, absolutely. Doghouse, population me.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.125
How are we gonna be the Spies with Soul

19:28.208 --> 19:31.003
when we just beat the snot
out of a bunch of tree huggers?

19:31.086 --> 19:32.171
Oh, not to worry.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.798
I made that donation
in the name of the agency.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.552
-Sure to cause quite a bit of a splash.
-Wow. That was really smart.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.264
-And we do seem like more of a team.
-And all it took was a hijacking.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.976
Yes, but now that I'm a few million
in the hole with you all,

19:46.059 --> 19:48.645
we're gonna have to make
some changes around here.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.523
So unless you suddenly find
a new source of funds,

19:51.607 --> 19:54.651
you're going to be buying
your own drinks, mister.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.819
Indefinitely.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.905
[dog whines]

19:57.988 --> 19:58.989
What?
