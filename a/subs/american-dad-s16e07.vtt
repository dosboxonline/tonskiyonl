I bet it's, like,
a bunch of human anuses

What?
Naomi's great.

The beauty of my characters
is their diversity.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.532
They can't all be
serial killers.

Your last serial-killer persona
never even killed anyone.

whose only noteworthy quality

05:39.505 --> 05:42.842

very thoroughly -- to the park.

Of course.

an Iowa woman is just gone,

even though he's never
heard of the show.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.264
Could something supernatural
be at play?

07:11.347 --> 07:15.017
But first, we have an
Unsolved Mysteries update.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.604
Three years ago,
child-pageant queen

07:18.688 --> 07:21.107
Bonnie Ramirez went missing.

07:21.190 --> 07:25.278
With no clues left behind,
Bonnie was gone forever.

07:25.361 --> 07:28.739
Until this week, when she
was spotted at the park

07:28.823 --> 07:32.618
with a woman
going by Francine Smith.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.370
Authorities believe
Smith has been

07:34.454 --> 07:38.458
holding little Bonnie captive
this entire time.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.793
Smith is now in police custody

07:40.877 --> 07:43.546
and scheduled
for trial this week.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.674
And additionally, to
the growing number of viewers

07:46.757 --> 07:50.803
posting online that I'm the one
kidnapping all these kids,

07:50.887 --> 07:53.389
see? Not me.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.144
Your mother's obviously
gonna be fine.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.897
This is just some silly feud
between her and Roger.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.066
But I do have one concern --
the cruise.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.610
We were supposed
to go this week.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.778
And I'd argue we still should.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.199
A trial like this can't be easy
on the family of the accused.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.075
I think we deserve a getaway.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.952
We'd be back
before the verdict.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.537
-I'm in.
-Wonderful.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.664
There is just one more issue.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.042
Your mom purchased
the cruise in her name,

08:21.125 --> 08:23.461
and Party Artie's
Floating Family Shitshow

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087
won't let us onboard
without her.

08:25.171 --> 08:29.842
We just need someone
who can pass for her.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.260
She looks like Mom.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.429
Maybe more like
Mom than Mom.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.348
In my head,
when I think of your mom,

08:35.431 --> 08:36.974
I now picture this woman.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.185
It's settled.
We're going on the cruise.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.937
It's what Francine --
and by that,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.481
I mean this woman --
would have wanted.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.696
Your court-appointed
attorney's here.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.199
Him? Unh-unh.
No way.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.619
Sorry. No one else is willing
to defend a monster like you.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.621
Aaaah!

08:58.704 --> 09:00.748
What the hell have you
gotten me into?

09:00.831 --> 09:02.542
I'm going on trial!

09:02.625 --> 09:05.294
Wow, sounds like
the work of someone

09:05.378 --> 09:07.463
who hasn't lost their edge.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.714
Jesus, Roger.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.424
I admit it, okay?

09:10.508 --> 09:12.552
You haven't lost your edge
or you're not washed up

09:12.635 --> 09:14.262
or whatever this is about.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.348
Just tell everyone I didn't
do it so we can end this.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.267
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.060
You're just telling me
what I want to hear

09:21.143 --> 09:23.521
because you're desperate,
but I'm gonna show you

09:23.604 --> 09:26.732
I've still got it
and in undeniable fashion.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.526
No.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.654
I'm gonna give the performance
of my life as little Bonnie,

09:31.737 --> 09:33.656
bringing you
to the brink of conviction,

09:33.739 --> 09:36.659
only to be topped by
my public-defender character --

09:36.742 --> 09:38.869
Ed Dickle,
the ultimate showman --

09:38.953 --> 09:40.454
who's gonna rake
that little girl

09:40.538 --> 09:42.415
over the coals
to get you off.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.167
Let's get to work.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.169
What's this?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.881
An even smaller briefcase?

09:50.965 --> 09:53.009
Another?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.802
A key?

09:54.885 --> 09:56.846
But to what?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.889
This.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.017
The ultimate showman!

10:01.100 --> 10:03.477
Oh, here's my phone bill.
Hang on.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.396
I should knock this out
while I'm thinking about it.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.856
Got a charge on here
I don't recognize.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.067
Your call is important to us --

10:10.151 --> 10:11.402
Trust me,
you want this resolved

10:11.485 --> 10:13.696
so I can give your case
full focus.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.366
Can you even
pull this off,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.535
Bonnie and the lawyer
in the same room?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.872
You forget I got
super-speed, baby.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.249
Roger!

10:28.419 --> 10:30.087
Sorry, was trying
to do something cool there,

10:30.171 --> 10:31.255
but you get the point.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.673
I'm over here now.
I'm fast.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.092
So you were the real
Bonnie Ramirez, huh?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.178
Yep. But got bored with
the whole pageant thing,

10:37.261 --> 10:38.929
so I just wandered off
one day.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.181
Didn't think the family
was gonna make

10:40.264 --> 10:41.724
such a big deal about it.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.559
I mean, they only knew her
for like five years.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.186
JAG was on
twice that long,

10:45.269 --> 10:47.229
and no one's crying about
that going off the air.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.358
Oh, God, such a good show!

10:52.943 --> 10:55.988
Thank you so much for coming
with us, Isabella.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.740
It's the least I could do.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.159
This must be a very hard time
for you.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.370
Good thing I'm literally
in Margaritaville

11:02.453 --> 11:04.288
with all these piña coladas.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.040
-Mmm.
-Hey, Steve.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.292
Am I gonna see your moves
in the dance contest tomorrow?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.003
Y-You -- You know it.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.838
You know that badass?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.508
She's the only kid I couldn't
bully off the foosball table.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.426
I met her at the Teen Hang Zone,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
but it's not gonna matter
after tomorrow.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.806
She's expecting me to perform
in the dance contest,

11:21.889 --> 11:23.015
and I'm terrible.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.101
You know, Steve,
I used to dance

11:25.184 --> 11:27.436
competitively back
in Johannesburg.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.146
I could show you a few steps.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.273
Wow, that would be amazing.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.317
Root beer, red wine,

11:33.401 --> 11:34.902
another piña colada
for the lady,

11:34.985 --> 11:38.114
and an Arnold Palmer
for the gentleman.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.700
Stan, what's wrong?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.952
It's just this
is an Arnold Palmer,

11:43.035 --> 11:46.414
and I asked for
a triple-vodka Coke.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.332
It's fine.
It's basically the same thing.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.793
Stick up for yourself, Stan.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.629
You're the only man here
wearing a shirt to dinner.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.174
You deserve
to be treated right.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.509
Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry.

11:58.592 --> 11:59.969
I hope it's not
too much trouble,

12:00.052 --> 12:02.513
but I actually ordered
a triple-vodka Coke,

12:02.596 --> 12:03.848
and, for some reason,

12:03.931 --> 12:05.391
you chose to me
in the face

12:05.474 --> 12:08.686
with what looks like
a glass of piss and shit.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.313
Now, get me what I ordered
before I shoot you to death

12:11.397 --> 12:13.065
in front of this crowd
full of drunks.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.191
Please.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.068
All right, Dad!

12:17.653 --> 12:19.071
Little Bonnie,

12:19.155 --> 12:22.116
please take a look
around the room.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.535
Is the person who imprisoned
you here today?

12:24.618 --> 12:25.619
Yes. Her.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.996
Pink dress.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.289
Oh, it was horrible.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.708
She made me call her "Mama God."

12:30.791 --> 12:33.836
She kept me in a cage
and only fed me moths.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.632
Actually developed
a taste for 'em.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.055
Mm. Did I miss anything
while I was gone?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.266
Aunt Becky from Full House
up to anything?

12:47.349 --> 12:49.310
I'm just playing.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.687
Even I heard about that
college-admissions scandal.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.690
Yep, Mama God told me
and Nancy all about it.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.150
I'm sorry. Who?

12:56.233 --> 12:57.818
Oh, Nancy was just
one of the many,

12:57.902 --> 13:00.863
many other children mashed
into that cage with me.

13:02.323 --> 13:05.201
You're supposed to tell me
everything.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.828
So, Mr. Dickle,
it's your turn

13:07.912 --> 13:10.664
to cross-examine
little Bonnie.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.250
Finally, our side of the story.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.543
All good, dude.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.796
Are you sure?
I'm in pretty deep here.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.715
Relax. I got an ace in the hole.
You're golden.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.425
Very well, Mr. Dickle.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.636
You may now call
your first witness.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.681

13:48.661 --> 13:52.748
Mr. Dickle,
this is not how trials work,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.626
especially not here at
the Chimdale County Courthouse

13:55.709 --> 13:57.837
presented by
Carruthers Auto Mall.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.840
All evidence must be
submitted in advance.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.844
I couldn't submit it in advance.
I staged it last night.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.888
It's okay.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.139
There's got to be another

14:11.851 --> 14:13.227
Here. Don't hang up.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.895
I'm still on hold
with the phone company.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.189
This is Sarah B.
How may I assist you today?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.191
Oh, my God! Have someone else go

14:19.275 --> 14:20.734

14:54.560 --> 14:57.730
Steve, what you just did on
the dance floor with your mom...

14:57.813 --> 14:59.189
Yeah?

14:59.273 --> 15:01.817
...is exactly why I want
to have a son one day!

15:02.818 --> 15:05.070
I always knew you had talent.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.697
It just took
a complete stranger

15:06.780 --> 15:10.367
making the smallest effort
to unlock it.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.036
-Sister!
-Oh, my God!

15:12.119 --> 15:13.621
What do we do?

15:13.704 --> 15:17.374
Listen, everything will be okay
if we act fast.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.377
I'm going in after her.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.963
Stan, go tell the captain
to stop at once.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.049
Steve, offer your coat
to the girl.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.301
The girl, accept it,
and give Steve a kiss.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.887
Bye-by-y-y-y-e!

15:34.975 --> 15:37.478
Mwah!

15:37.561 --> 15:39.355
Iceberg...

15:39.438 --> 15:42.858
lettuce is the crunchiest

15:51.700 --> 15:53.619

But cuttin' our lunch
break short must mean

15:55.621 --> 15:57.665
they can't wait
to give us the good news.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.124
This can't be happening.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.836
The jury finds
Francine Smith --

16:02.920 --> 16:05.047
oh, thank God -- guilty.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.759
Okay, let's wrap this up.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.929
Mr. Dickle, pick a number
between one and four.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.597
-Four!
-Perfect.

16:13.681 --> 16:17.351
I hereby sentence Ms. Smith
to four life sentences.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.479
I just assumed you'd find a way
out of this like you always do.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.857
Yeah, me too.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.109
But you didn't.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.946
Oh, my God.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.156
It's just hitting me
what happened here.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.659
I really have lost my edge.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.583
I'm nothing but
a washed-up fool now.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.544
Life comes at you fast.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.337
One minute, you're on top
of the world,

16:45.421 --> 16:46.797
and the next you're explaining

16:46.880 --> 16:49.800
what just happened
to nobody in the kitchen.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.971
Boy, I tell ya, the Internet
is a wonderful place.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.265
Everybody is so supportive.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.642
Whoa, you look terrible.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.853
Get used to it.
This is the new me.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.312
The washed-up me.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.189
The me who doesn't have
his edge anymore.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.858
What happened?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.318
Francine went to prison
for kidnapping some little girl.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.528
Oh, damn!

17:09.611 --> 17:11.155
You lost that case?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.991
Yep. The old me would've
weaseled her out of it,

17:14.074 --> 17:17.995
but she's in prison now
'cause I blew it.

17:18.078 --> 17:21.665
A tragic ending for ol' Rog.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.709
You guys,
the cruise was awesome.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
I should've died!

17:25.461 --> 17:28.338
And I got robbed by
a 30-year-old Romanian stowaway

17:28.422 --> 17:30.382
pretending to be
a teenage girl.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.927
But guess who got a kiss first.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.637
You look like hell.
Get cleaned up,

17:35.721 --> 17:36.972
and we'll drive to court
together.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.849
Mm, we lost.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.017
She's in prison forever.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.685
-What?!
-Oh, my God!

17:41.769 --> 17:44.229
Roger, I have decided
to hurt you.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.523
You must be Uncle Roger.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.816
Why don't we go
to the living room,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.360
and I can hear your side
of the story?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.072
Stan, listen.
I have an idea.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.698
I got the mail every day
you were gone,

17:54.782 --> 17:57.743
so I think I should get
extra allowance this week.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.036
That's your idea?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.705
Ple-e-e-ase!

18:01.789 --> 18:03.415
And now Francine's in prison,

18:03.499 --> 18:05.584
and it's all because
I lost my edge.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.503
I'm washed up. I'm done.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.546
Listen to yourself.

18:09.630 --> 18:13.383
Your friend's locked up,
and all I hear is, "I, I, I."

18:13.467 --> 18:16.512
Wow.
You missed a ton of what I said.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.306
The best way to get back
on track is to forget

18:19.389 --> 18:21.725
about the "I's"
and focus on others.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.062
You know, that actually
makes a lot of sense.

18:25.145 --> 18:28.732
But where do I --
sorry, where do me begin?

18:28.816 --> 18:32.528
Well, for starters, have you
even visited Francine yet?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.737
No.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.364
We're going to visit her
right now.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.366
-I'll gather the others.
-Love it.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.576
Would follow you to the end
of the Earth.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.287
One quick question --
who are you?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.126
-Mom!
-It's so good to see you.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.210
My girl.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.130
Who the hell is that?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.297
That's Isabella.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.258
She played you in
a TV reenactment.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.759
And in the cruise
we took without you.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.469
She's awesome.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.889
And, most importantly, she
showed me how selfish I've been.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.434
If I wasn't so concerned about
proving I still had my edge,

19:04.518 --> 19:06.228
there's a chance
you wouldn't be in here.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.479
A chance?!

19:07.563 --> 19:09.356
A very good chance.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.359
Francine, Isabella taught me
something special --

19:12.442 --> 19:14.653
how valuable
helping others can be.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.321
So with that said...

19:20.868 --> 19:22.786
H-H-How did I get in this?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.996
What's going on?

19:24.079 --> 19:25.789
Time's up. Come on.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.834
No!
I didn't do anything!

19:28.917 --> 19:32.087
I'm not supposed to be here!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.006
Listen to all those "I's."

19:34.089 --> 19:35.841
Focus on how selfless it is

19:35.924 --> 19:38.385
to do four life sentences
for someone.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.720
We got to get out of here.

19:44.641 --> 19:45.726
Did you see that?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.477
I just imprisoned
an innocent woman

19:47.561 --> 19:50.063
and freed
a convicted child abductor.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.815
How's that for edgy?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.860
Couldn't we have solved this
without anybody going to prison?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.820
That woman saved my life.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.156
We could have, but then you
wouldn't have gotten to go

19:59.239 --> 20:00.657
on your precious cruise.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.410
Yes, I would -- with Mom.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.037
But then who would've
saved your life?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.372
Whoa.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.666
Roger, if I didn't have
this seatbelt on,

20:09.750 --> 20:11.168
I'd punch you
right in the face.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.462
No.
Thank you, Francine.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.797
You were right.
I'd gotten complacent,

20:15.881 --> 20:18.550
and I needed your little push
to get back on track.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.344
And, boy, am I back.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.763
You wanted
interesting characters?

20:22.846 --> 20:26.308
Toga Gomez, NASCAR Vampire.

20:26.391 --> 20:30.854
Jenna Diarrhea-Evans,
heiress to the diarrhea fortune.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.358
Gord Gullmax,
Michael Jackson apologist.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.611
Lieutenant Wingz,
enormous mosquito.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.404
Wow.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.198
I can't believe Mom almost spent
the rest of her life in prison

20:41.281 --> 20:43.867
because she said
Roger lost his edge.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.495
Geez.
Talk about overly sensitive.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.081
Okay, Roger! I'm sorry!

20:49.164 --> 20:52.000
You're not sensitive!

20:52.084 --> 20:54.544
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.505
You're just telling me
what I want to hear

20:56.588 --> 20:57.965
because you're desperate.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.050
No shit I'm desperate!

21:00.133 --> 21:02.219
-You sweared.
-Aah!

21:02.302 --> 21:04.221
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
