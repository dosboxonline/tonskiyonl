WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:05.797
[laughs] Another win
for the greatest spy on earth.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.215
Lana? Win toast?

00:07.298 --> 00:09.259
It's 9:00 in the morning.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.053
Yeah, and champagne is like
the breakfast of alcohols.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.888
<i>Congratulations, team.</i>

00:13.972 --> 00:16.975
<i>Your success has given</i>
<i>your company great buzz.</i>

00:17.058 --> 00:20.103
-<i>"Roomful of bees" buzz.</i>
-<i>Bees with buzz cuts.</i>

00:20.186 --> 00:22.397
-<i>Swarming Buzz Aldrin.</i>
-<i>That's a lot of buzz.</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:26.317
<i>And Robert's sizable donation</i>
<i>to the environmental fund didn't hurt.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:27.986
<i>Arguably, it did most of the work.</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:30.822
<i>That's a heavy check</i>
<i>doing some heavy lifting.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:31.906
<i>But still…</i>

00:31.990 --> 00:33.324
<i>-great buzz.</i>
<i>-Great buzz.</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:38.038
I notice you say "buzz,"
but we hired you for job offers.

00:38.121 --> 00:41.916
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>You are top of mind for many stakeholders.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:44.210
<i>You just need a splashy success.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:48.047
-<i>Not that this wasn't a success.</i>
-<i>But it was a normal success.</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:51.468
-<i>And now we get splashy.</i>
-<i>Cannonball!</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:55.722
I'm sorry, saving an entire plane
from hijackers isn't splashy?

00:55.805 --> 00:58.516
<i>Buzz is also saying that was like 80…</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:01.061
-<i>Eighty-five.</i>
-<i>…percent an accident.</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.438
That last 15% was all me.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.315
[groans] Sorry. All me

01:05.398 --> 01:07.901
-with an assist from my supporting cast.
-[groans]

01:07.984 --> 01:10.153
<i>Anyway, keep up the good work!</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:12.447
<i>And remember, leap without a net.</i>

01:12.530 --> 01:14.365
<i>Alton, where's your parachute?</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:17.994
-<i>Oh, boy. If my head wasn't attached…</i>
-[laughs]

01:18.787 --> 01:21.456
-Useless.
-[laughs] Speak of the devil.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.625
Guys, I found something amazing.

01:23.708 --> 01:28.463
I was reorganizing our old filing system,
and discovered we have an open contract.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.048
Something about ongoing service

01:30.131 --> 01:33.551
for high-sensitivity
battery replacement in London.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.720
Oh, goodness.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.598
I haven't thought about that in years.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.352
-So, you gonna…
-Shh, shh, shh.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.812
I'm remembering.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.780
[door opens]

02:07.544 --> 02:10.296
-[Pam] We talking beefcake?
-This is a closed meeting.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.675
Duh-hoy. Why do you think
we wanted in here so bad?

02:13.758 --> 02:15.218
Now give me dem deets.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.221
Fine, the man is Cornelius Varma,

02:18.304 --> 02:22.225
great-grandnephew
of the Indian maharani of Travancore.

02:22.308 --> 02:26.688
He had the physique of a tawny Adonis,
and the nimblest fingers you've ever--

02:26.771 --> 02:30.358
-Okay, Mother. We get it.
-I'm referring to the way he placed bugs.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.485
Jesus, I don't need to know
what you call it.

02:32.569 --> 02:36.239
-Wait, why were you bugging the British?
-It was a different time.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.616
-1812?
-Cyril, you were saying?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.993
Well, according to the case file,

02:40.076 --> 02:43.163
if the batteries are replaced,
the bug will release a code.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.291
If we transmit the code to the account
where the money is held--

02:46.374 --> 02:48.126
-Dollar, dollar bills, y'all?
-Bingo.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.712
Not flying to England
to change a battery for 20 bucks.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.714
-It's pounds, Lana.
-You know what I meant.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.299
I know how to finish my insults.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.801
Geezy Pete. I just checked
the battery bank account.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.054
With interest, it's currently holding
over a million dollars.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.389
-What?
-That's cute.

03:01.472 --> 03:05.643
I think you're going to need an assist
from someone who knows the territory.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.396
Someone who, if need be,

03:08.479 --> 03:12.317
can call on an important ally in a pinch.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.279
"And who's that," he said,
dread creeping into his voice?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.991
["God Save The Queen" playing]

03:20.074 --> 03:22.702
Was the catsuit really necessary?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.579
For me? No.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.456
It's more for the public.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.958
-Ah.
-[groans] Still got it.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.335
Thank you, Sterling.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.754
And by it, I mean this image,

03:32.837 --> 03:35.965
burned into my retinas
till the end of time.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.467
Lucky boy.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.923
[coughing]

04:17.006 --> 04:20.510
Geez, this place is as dusty as a… a…

04:20.593 --> 04:22.011
A desert in a sandstorm?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.846
My signed oath to do no harm?

04:23.930 --> 04:27.016
-Eleanor Roosevelt's vagina?
-Aw, sad if true.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.769
Stop. I would have had something.
Lana got in my head.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.897
-Not really a challenge.
-Pardon me. Delivery for Lana Kane?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.192
Damn it, Krieger, I thought you told me
this place was secure.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.070
-I told you, or you thought I told you?
-[groans]

04:39.153 --> 04:41.281
-Just leave them by the door.
-Right, then.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.032
Nope, take them back.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.661
If Robert thinks for one second
that a handful of glorified weeds

04:46.744 --> 04:49.747
can make up for what he said to me,
he is more mistaken than--

04:49.831 --> 04:51.416
You were for marrying him?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.584
-Ha! I'm back, baby!
-[Malory] Focus.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.587
According to our records,
the bug was still active

04:56.671 --> 04:58.798
until the battery went out
three years ago.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.342
Since it was powered down,
there's a good chance

05:01.426 --> 05:03.344
it hasn't been picked up by sweeps.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.805
So, here's how we retrieve it.

05:05.888 --> 05:09.017
<i>Sterling and Lana,</i>
<i>you'll be making ingress…</i>

05:09.100 --> 05:10.852
[Archer] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if we'll have time for that.</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:12.478
[Lana] <i>Uh, not what it means.</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:14.897
[Malory] <i>…through the second-story window.</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:19.444
Cyril, you'll stay on the ground
and monitor the area for reinforcements.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.239
-Try not to eat anything important.
-This is my last one forever.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.992
You talking to us,
or the ten bars in your pocket?

05:26.075 --> 05:30.038
Pam and Cheryl, you'll surveil
from the square across the street,

05:30.121 --> 05:31.331
blending in as--

05:31.414 --> 05:34.000
[both, in British accent]
Fancy English ladies.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.752
My hat is huge.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.463
You know, we British invented giant hats

05:38.546 --> 05:43.092
as a way to temper an overly
aggressive pigeon population.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.886
-Wait!
-[yelps]

05:44.969 --> 05:46.137
[in normal voice] Is that true?

05:46.220 --> 05:48.514
Meanwhile,
I'll be in the van with Krieger,

05:48.598 --> 05:51.642
running the entire show
with immaculate precision.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.270
Just like the Rockettes. Jazz legs!

05:54.353 --> 05:56.689
-<i>Once you're in position--</i>
-Postcoital.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.940
[Lana] Post-ingress.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.317
-Same thing.
-It's not.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.444
[Malory]
<i>Krieger will jam the alarm system.</i>

06:01.527 --> 06:03.571
-What about the bug?
-Some of my best work.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.743
-Not bad, Mother.
-<i>I modeled the breasts on my own.</i>

06:08.826 --> 06:11.204
Is it possible for you to just not?

06:11.287 --> 06:15.500
<i>And you'll be happy to know,</i>
<i>they're still a dead match.</i>

06:15.583 --> 06:17.210
I was happier before I knew.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.045
So how do we get the code off the bug?

06:19.128 --> 06:21.089
I whipped a little something up.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.840
Sorry, do you have anything bigger?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.760
Dude, this is ancient tech.
It doesn't interface with anything modern.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.096
-And the giant flashing lights?
-Those are for me.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.431
Got the code.

06:31.265 --> 06:35.186
[Malory] <i>Good. Now rub the center</i>
<i>of my breasts to reactivate.</i>

06:35.269 --> 06:37.939
-What?
-<i>Sorry, the breasts.</i>

06:38.022 --> 06:42.193
I'm terrified of crossing a societal taboo
that exists for a reason.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.820
Oh, my God.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.489
-<i>Was that so hard?</i>
-[Cyril] <i>No.</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:49.242
You're not just
some sugar-guzzling self-flagellater.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.327
You're part of an elite spy team.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.704
Case in point.
I've got someone on approach.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.999
He's looking right at me.
Now he's waving at me.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.710
And I'm waving back? Hello.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.587
[sighs] I think that went really well.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.799
-No, no, no. Bad news.
-What is it?

07:04.882 --> 07:08.136
My jamming of the alarm system
is itself being jammed.

07:08.219 --> 07:11.431
-It's a classic double jam!
-So the alarm is reactivated?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.266
Sterling, get out of there!

07:13.349 --> 07:15.476
Oh, wait, now he's picking up a rock.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.770
Yep, he's throwing the rock. Oh!

07:17.854 --> 07:19.772
He almost hit that security camera.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.775
-And now I'm waving at it. Cheerio.
-[alarm blaring]

07:22.859 --> 07:25.069
For once I feel comfortable
saying that wasn't me.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.654
Run, you dimwits!

07:30.741 --> 07:32.910
[Lana] Cyril,
you were supposed to watch the street,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.370
not your goddamn candy bar!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.080
I was. And I didn't.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.416
I put the candy bar away.
It was a really big moment.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.294
Well, thanks to you,
our next big moment is British jail,

07:41.377 --> 07:43.004
which is probably pretty nice.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.672
[alarm continues blaring]

07:45.756 --> 07:46.757
-[fabric rips]
-Ah!

07:46.841 --> 07:50.178
-This day was going so--
-Characteristically unwell?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.388
-Ow!
-Shit, did that hurt?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.183
-Get the suitcase, asshole.
-Right, right, yeah. Of course.

07:58.102 --> 08:02.523
Mission update. We failed, and Lana
got punched by some sort of magician.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.150
<i>A suspect has been identified</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:06.694
<i>in the late-night break-in</i>
<i>at Number 10 Downing Street.</i>

08:06.777 --> 08:09.447
[in British accent] Darling,
did you have to look straight on?

08:09.530 --> 08:12.283
Like his profile's any better. [giggles]

08:12.366 --> 08:15.620
Malory, please. It was a mistake
any of us could have made.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.331
[news anchor] <i>Some speculate</i>
<i>that the burglar is American,</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:20.791
<i>due to the American candy wrapper</i>
<i>found at the scene.</i>

08:20.875 --> 08:24.670
<i>If the US government is involved,</i>
<i>it would mark the first hostile exchange</i>

08:24.754 --> 08:27.882
<i>between the two countries</i>
<i>since the War of 1812.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:29.759
Does this count as splashy?

08:33.971 --> 08:36.265
Okay, team, no need to panic.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.768
Let's just take stock of where we are.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.437
-Well, the suitcase is gone.
-Along with our payday.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.565
Cyril, stop talking about
candy bars, you Zero.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.983
Wait, I can do better.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.737
The Three Musketeers
would pay a Bounty of 100 Grand

08:49.820 --> 08:51.113
to send you to Mars.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.157
Boom, Score.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.409
Is no one even gonna Snicker at that?

08:55.493 --> 08:56.869
Oh, just kill me.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.873
If it wouldn't attract more attention,
I would have already.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.377
Now stand in the corner
and look at the ground.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.921
I want options, people.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.423
-I did put a tracker on the suitcase.
-[all] What?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.343
I also put a receiver in the tracker
so it can record data from the bug.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.096
So we just bugged
the British prime minister? [laughs]

09:15.179 --> 09:16.430
It really is 1812.

09:16.514 --> 09:20.184
Lana and Sterling, track down the thief
and secure the suitcase.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.563
Take Idiot One and Idiot Two as lookouts.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.024
[in British accent] Mummy wants us
to go on an outing. How exciting!

09:27.108 --> 09:28.359
Indubitably.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.236
A truly professional outfit.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.072
[gasps] The gentleman's
complimented our hats.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.784
-Well, this won't get old.
-And the lady's a right old crank.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.369
-And Cyril?
-Yes?

09:38.452 --> 09:42.665
-I have a plan for you after all.
-[gulps]

09:42.748 --> 09:44.333
[Lana] According to Krieger's tracker,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.836
the suitcase-napper is keeping
to crowded public spaces.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.505
Suitcase-napper?
What is he, a nursery rhyme villain?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.800
-Or whoever. Who do you think he is?
-An IIA agent, probably.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.428
Why don't we save time
and intercept him at their headquarters?

09:55.511 --> 09:58.848
Because, genius,
there's no IIA headquarters in London.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.349
Well, that's inconvenient.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.978
Hi, guys. My tracking device tells me
he's 300 feet ahead of you.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.896
Time to nap the napper.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.065
See, Lana? See how stupid that sounds?

10:08.816 --> 10:10.860
Pam, Cheryl. Do you have eyes?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.528
[in British accent] Neither hide nor hair.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.864
'Tis like an apparition fair.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.241
Miss Cornish, Miss Worcestershire,
your table is ready.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.202
I shall ring if I see him. Ta-ta.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.414
You know, we Brits
spike our tea with opium.

10:23.497 --> 10:27.043
That's why it's called "high tea."

10:27.126 --> 10:28.461
-Nuh-uh.
-Look it up.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.670
-[rumbling]
-Wait!

10:29.754 --> 10:31.339
-[gasps]
-Thanks.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.634
These wretched servants
come out of nowhere!

10:35.176 --> 10:37.219
I think Mother's right
about cutting their salaries.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.432
Whatever. It can't be that hard
to spot a Black guy in an English crowd.

10:41.515 --> 10:44.185
Damn it, London's actually really diverse.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.269
Wait, there.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.855
Krieger, I've got him in sight.
Stand by for apprehension.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.024
Archer, I'll cross, you cover. Archer?

10:50.107 --> 10:52.276
Look, Lana, British tchotchkes.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.529
-Will you pay attention?
-I can pay attention and shop.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.324
Two pounds? You wish.
Actually, is that a lot?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.951
-I'm not clear on the exchange rate.
-I found the guy.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.453
-Where?
-What the--

11:02.536 --> 11:03.871
Man, this guy's like Houdini.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.123
Meaning he hopped in a cab
while you weren't looking?

11:06.207 --> 11:09.627
-While you weren't looking.
-I was looking. At tchotchkes.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.634
You aren't going to turn me
into fertilizer, are you?

11:16.717 --> 11:19.887
Please, your candy-infused blood

11:19.970 --> 11:22.890
would kill anything
it came in contact with.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.267
Ouch, but point taken.

11:25.351 --> 11:29.772
What's with all these
overly decorative pests?

11:29.855 --> 11:33.234
-You mean butterflies?
-Kill them as caterpillars, I say.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.985
So we aren't here to murder me,

11:35.069 --> 11:37.780
and we're clearly not here
to enjoy this beautiful garden.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.115
So what are we doing?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.033
We're meeting Cornelius Varma.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.285
The beefcake from 50 years ago?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.037
The ultimate agent.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.455
He'll fix your mess,

11:46.539 --> 11:50.209
-and then maybe make a mess out of me.
-Yeesh.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.713
[gasps] Malory!

11:54.797 --> 11:56.382
Brilliant of you to come.

11:56.465 --> 12:00.010
I think I need to talk to your son.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.346
-Maybe grandson?
-[laughs]

12:02.430 --> 12:05.015
Poppet, come on, it's me.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.143
Your beefcake turned into beef jerky.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.894
Oh, eat a gumdrop.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.731
[Cheryl in British accent]
Look, there's the Ravenmaster.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.277
Legend has it that
if the ravens ever leave this tower,

12:16.360 --> 12:18.779
the British Empire will crumble.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.533
Heavens to Murgatroyd.
What a frightful thought.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.078
-Hey! What the--
-Take that, you wankers!

12:26.162 --> 12:28.205
-The hell?
-The ravens are androids.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.374
-Guards!
-Wait!

12:31.083 --> 12:34.587
-'Tis a dangerous country.
-What are we supposed to be doing?

12:34.670 --> 12:37.006
Pick up the phone.
[sighs] Pam's not answering.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.134
More bad news. The shop wouldn't
exchange the key chain you broke.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.262
More, more bad news.
The suitcase is on the move.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.639
-Oh, bill me.
-Can I also bill you for a memory?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.391
Because this one is ruined.

12:47.475 --> 12:52.605
Hello, hello. What modeling agency
might I be dropping you off at, love?

12:52.688 --> 12:54.315
[laughs] Oh, you're too kind.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.567
-It's actually a porn shoot.
-Bugger me.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.362
That's actually the title of the porno.
Our friend will direct you to the studio.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.947
[Krieger] <i>Howdy, howdy.</i>

13:02.031 --> 13:04.783
-Careful, he might think you're fun.
-I am fun.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.285
-Ha!
-"Ha" what?

13:06.368 --> 13:09.955
She grumbled, not understanding
the sound of human laughter.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.123
What are you talking about?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.709
It's like rule number one
of our group dynamic, Lana,

13:13.792 --> 13:15.753
that you're not, and have never been, fun.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.880
No, rule number one is,
"Don't tell Pam a secret."

13:17.963 --> 13:19.548
Fine. Rule number two then.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.217
-Are we close?
-<i>Nope.</i>

13:21.300 --> 13:23.052
[Cornelius] And here we are.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.514
Wheat germ sandwiches
and decaffeinated tea.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.015
Good for the sciatica.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.726
Cornelius, we're on a bit of a schedule.

13:30.809 --> 13:34.146
My intelligence said
you were still an active agent.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.607
Wrong on both counts, I'm afraid.

13:36.690 --> 13:40.861
Bad knee and bad business,
ever since IIA took over.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.154
How are you faring?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.239
-Thriving.
-We're broke.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.367
You want my advice? Make a deal with IIA.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.454
Pocket a few quid for bugging
the prime minister, and retire.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.166
Close down?
Like some pathetic independent bookstore?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.627
It's less dreadful than you may think.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.879
We're both getting old, poppet.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.340
And they can pry my agency

14:01.423 --> 14:04.718
from my dead, grenade-holding fingers.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.012
You sound very American.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.014
I sound like you used to.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.975
Remember why we got into this?

14:11.058 --> 14:13.143
To bring down the powerful.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.105
No one could afford
not to be afraid of us.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.774
And in that way, we were truly free.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.484
Hmm. [laughs]

14:20.568 --> 14:23.362
You haven't changed a bit.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.365
-And I never intend to.
-Very well, then.

14:26.448 --> 14:31.036
I'll contact my people to see if
we can dig up anything on your IIA agent.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.124
But, Mal, I'd like you to do
something for me in return.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.334
Fine, but keep it over the shirt.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.670
[Lana] <i>That's your example</i>
<i>of me not being fun?</i>

14:39.753 --> 14:40.754
Oh, I have more.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.340
Like the time you made me
change two diapers in one day.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.342
For your own child.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.928
Then the time you made me
not sleep with that diplomat's wife.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.347
And the time you made me
not sleep with that czar's wife.

14:50.431 --> 14:54.143
-And the time you made me not sleep with--
-These are examples of you being a dick.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.604
[Archer]
And frankly, Lana, you responded poorly.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.938
Because you're no fun.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.441
What about the time in Sicily
when we got pegged as agents,

15:00.524 --> 15:02.443
and I round-house
kicked a bouncer in the face?

15:02.526 --> 15:05.070
-How is that fun?
-I was wearing kitten heels.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.655
Krieger, are we getting close?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.491
Oh, God, no.
The target is at the British Library.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.494
What? That's like two miles away.
How is he moving so fast?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.998
<i>On the plus side, it looks like</i>
<i>Cheryl and Pam are right on top of him.</i>

15:16.081 --> 15:20.377
You can't hide your secrets forever.
I know about the magic books, I does!

15:20.461 --> 15:22.379
[in normal voice]
Damn, you're heavy for a skinny girl.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.423
[Lana] <i>Pam,</i>
<i>the target is running right past you.</i>

15:24.506 --> 15:26.967
-Who?
-[Archer] <i>The spy, Pam. With the suitcase.</i>

15:27.051 --> 15:29.178
-<i>Literally the reason we're in London.</i>
-Oh, right.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.680
-Yeah, I don't see anybody.
-<i>How can that be?</i>

15:31.764 --> 15:34.934
<i>And how is he covering ground so fast?</i>
<i>This city is packed.</i>

15:35.017 --> 15:38.812
[in British accent] Through the secret
escape tunnels in the British sewers.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.899
[groans]
Why don't you Americans know anything?

15:41.982 --> 15:43.943
[Lana] <i>Huh. Does she know</i>
<i>what she's talking about?</i>

15:44.026 --> 15:46.195
I truly have no idea.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.077
[groans] So, how far
do we walk through human feces

15:53.160 --> 15:55.788
before we decide this isn't
a secret escape tunnel?

15:55.871 --> 15:57.247
Bermuda! Ha!

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
Not sure this sewer is transatlantic.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.962
No. My proof that I'm fun.
Fifteen years ago in Bermuda.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.507
Oh, You mean, Bermuda, Bermuda?
Back when we were first together?

16:06.590 --> 16:09.802
We were on that stakeout,
and it was taking a really long time.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.054
By the river.
I was fun with you four times.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.224
Then two more times in the river.
Sploosh and bam.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.685
-Nope, doesn't count.
-Oh? Why not?

16:17.768 --> 16:20.354
Because you never did it again,
and now you've depressed me

16:20.437 --> 16:22.856
by making me remember,
actively sucking the fun away.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.026
And that's the last
active sucking you'll ever get.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.987
-Phrasing.
-Obviously!

16:28.070 --> 16:31.907
[Malory] <i>Everyone, our man</i>
<i>is approaching the London Eye.</i>

16:31.991 --> 16:34.493
[laughs] Look out, old Blighty!

16:34.576 --> 16:39.123
Cornelius Varma is coming
for one last hurrah.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.126
Okay, to catch this guy,
I say we surface to the street,

16:42.209 --> 16:45.045
hijack a speedboat, and joyride
through the River Thames.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.632
Or we just keep moving this way,
which would be ten times faster.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.260
See? No fun.

16:51.343 --> 16:55.055
Oh, God, of course this happens
when I'm in a van without bazookas.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.183
Take a left at the corner.
There's an open alley we can fit through.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.394
No, they shuttered that ages ago.

17:00.477 --> 17:05.399
The only way through London at this hour
is the chockablock route.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.652
The chockablock route?
We nearly died last time.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.488
Since when are you afraid
of a little danger?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.656
We'll need a bike.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
[motorcycle engine revving]

17:14.324 --> 17:17.077
-[motorcyclist groans]
-Seems I've secured one.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.830
Oh, Cornelius.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.461
-Do you think they're going to--
-Yep.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.177
There. Wait.
Why would he get on a Ferris wheel?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.471
Wow, you're really
not getting this "fun" thing.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.890
I mean it's a dead end, you dick.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.144
Shit. Not if you have a helicopter.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.896
Everybody get here. Now.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.857
-Yes, ma'am.
-Go where? It's bumper-to-bumper.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.568
Then I guess the bumper is coming with us.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.489
-[Cyril shrieks]
-Ah!

17:53.572 --> 17:56.700
-Upshift! Upshift!
-Damn it, woman! Would you like to drive?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.660
I thought you'd never ask.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.917
[Cheryl screaming]

18:05.000 --> 18:06.752
It's okay! We're Americans.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.505
-[screams]
-[Cyril] Oh, whoa.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.340
-Tchotchkes!
-I see them.

18:12.674 --> 18:16.303
-I meant avoid them.
-[laughs] Oops. Next time.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.561
Damn. This guy's good
at climbing Ferris wheels.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.271
Where is everyone?

18:27.106 --> 18:29.024
We made it! [panting]

18:30.943 --> 18:33.320
[in British accent]
My sincerest apologies.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.367
Remember that time we were scouting
that iron ore mine in Madagascar,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.953
and you told me not to
swallow ferromagnetic flakes?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.621
Archer, it's not the time.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.999
Always the time, Lana.
Because if I had listened to you then--

18:46.083 --> 18:49.294
You wouldn't have vomited chunks
that stuck to the break room fridge

18:49.378 --> 18:51.255
so they had to throw the whole thing away?

18:51.338 --> 18:52.756
Well, yeah, that.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.385
And also, I wouldn't have
the idea to do this.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.222
Whoo-hoo!

19:00.931 --> 19:02.891
I am the magnet master!

19:02.975 --> 19:05.853
North and south polarities
are mine to command.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.020
[Lana] Be careful.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.608
-[Fabian] <i>Yeah, Archer. Listen to Mummy.</i>
-Fabian?

19:11.692 --> 19:14.319
<i>You really haven't changed the frequency</i>

19:14.403 --> 19:16.989
<i>of your comms after I broke</i>
<i>into them last time?</i>

19:17.072 --> 19:18.657
<i>Top-notch spy craft there.</i>

19:18.740 --> 19:20.409
How's this for spy craft?

19:21.743 --> 19:23.078
[grunts]

19:26.290 --> 19:29.543
-[people gasp]
-[Fabian] <i>I would say, not great.</i>

19:29.626 --> 19:31.420
And I would say, shut up.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.005
Archer! The helicopter!

19:34.756 --> 19:37.801
Backup would be nice anytime. Pam? Cheryl?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.219
[Pam burps]

19:39.303 --> 19:42.264
[laughs] I have no idea what
we're supposed to be doing,

19:42.347 --> 19:44.641
but I think you own a rugby team now.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.227
[in British accent]
Whoo-hoo! Long live the zombie king!

19:47.311 --> 19:50.981
Gotta admit, this was way more fun
than acting like normal tourists.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.358
[in normal voice] You know,
tourism was developed by the British

19:53.442 --> 19:56.653
to drum up support for the expansion
of an increasingly destructive empire.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.739
Its violent, cannibalistic success

19:58.822 --> 20:01.491
is basically the reason
the world will end in 50 years.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.951
Bullshit.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.747
[in British accent] See you boys
on the pitch or court or whatever.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.458
-Wait!
-I know. Traffic's on the right.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.001
-[tires screeching]
-[gasping]

20:11.084 --> 20:12.502
[Cyril] Sorry!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.671
[screaming]

20:17.424 --> 20:20.594
-[creaking]
-[all screaming]

20:20.677 --> 20:24.890
I can't help but notice that your team
is not as polished as we used to be.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.351
Eh, you work with the people you can get.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.652
Archer! Jump!

20:36.735 --> 20:38.820
Sorry, mind if I use you for something?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.155
[grunts]

20:40.239 --> 20:41.240
[screams]

20:41.323 --> 20:42.491
Lana!

20:44.326 --> 20:46.662
Now that's splashy.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.581
Wait, wait, wait, what about,
"How's that for a splash?"

20:49.665 --> 20:50.666
You know what?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.211
-Whoops.
-I could have died.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.922
-How'd you know I'd react in time?
-I didn't.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.590
Ha! You are fun.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.425
Well, thank you, Max Eisenhardt.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.512
Hey, call me Magneto.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.973
[sirens wailing]

21:07.182 --> 21:08.642
-[all] Yeah!
-[Krieger] <i>Kanpai!</i>

21:09.977 --> 21:12.145
Krieger, what's the chatter in parliament?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.231
They're blaming the incident on the IIA.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.818
Cornelius gave them a photo of
an employee who looks exactly like Cyril.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.279
Oh, who's the unlucky handsome devil?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.989
This guy doesn't look like me.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.741
-He's just dough-faced and depressed.
-Sounds like they nailed it.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.451
So, what are you gonna do
with the bug now?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.954
-Sell it to the highest bidder?
-I'm holding on to it.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.416
You never know when you'll need
to knock the powerful down a peg.

21:32.499 --> 21:36.253
Wow, Mother, I thought the only principles
you stuck to were dry martinis

21:36.336 --> 21:37.587
and never tipping the help.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.008
-Apparently, I have a third.
-That's strangely nice.

21:41.091 --> 21:44.303
But why was Cornelius so willing
to put his life on the line for us?

21:44.386 --> 21:46.680
Exactly how close were you two?

21:46.763 --> 21:50.017
Let's just say he knows
his way around a catsuit.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.769
-And let's not say anything else.
-Uh…

21:52.853 --> 21:56.690
-Is that zinc oxide in your cleavage?
-Yes. That's from a boating trip.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.568
-Stop. Don't say it.
-A motorboating trip.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.445
Oh. Oh. [laughs]

22:01.528 --> 22:02.904
Still got it.
