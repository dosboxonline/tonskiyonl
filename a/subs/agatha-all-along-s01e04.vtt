WEBVTT

00:17.333 --> 00:18.750
I've missed you.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.916
Don't you want me at my best?

00:20.916 --> 00:22.958
Let me get my purple back.

00:24.083 --> 00:27.458
- And then come find me.
- [chuckles]

00:28.750 --> 00:30.083
Okay, Agatha.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.208
Who are you?

00:32.208 --> 00:33.375
My name is... [distorts]

00:33.375 --> 00:35.541
Someone's put a sigil on that boy.

00:35.541 --> 00:37.333
A "sigil" is a spell?

00:37.333 --> 00:39.333
[guard] Gulliver! You've been
nothing but bad luck.

00:39.333 --> 00:43.083
Her mom was a witch
and also a famous goddess of rock.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.875
- Lorna Wu?
- Take it easy.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.750
She wrote the most famous Ballad version.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.958
Rumor has it
Lorna Wu was lost to the Witches' Road.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.333
[Alice] <i>The Road isn't real.</i>

00:51.333 --> 00:54.166
You groupies don't get it.
It's just a stupid song.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.375
[Teen] I really like your tattoo.

00:56.375 --> 00:57.708
[Alice] My mom made me get it,

00:57.708 --> 01:00.208
'cause she said all the women
in our family were cursed.

01:02.125 --> 01:03.125
She wasn't well.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.375
Mom?

01:06.375 --> 01:08.166
Your grandmother died today.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.208
It's my turn now.

01:10.208 --> 01:11.833
It's gonna kill me.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.083
Don't say that.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.125
[screams] I can't protect you!

01:17.208 --> 01:18.333
[Lilia] <i>"Tame your fears."</i>

01:18.333 --> 01:21.041
<i>That's what we're up against.
Our worst nightmares.</i>

01:21.791 --> 01:22.958
[Teen] Sharon's dead.

01:43.416 --> 01:45.083
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.083
You didn't think who had what in them?

01:51.500 --> 01:52.500
[scoffs]

02:01.541 --> 02:03.708
Everybody's being really quiet.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.958
[Lilia] Be respectful.

02:05.958 --> 02:08.708
For all we know,
her mother died on The Road, too.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.541
My mom did die on the road.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.375
We don't know that for sure.

02:14.375 --> 02:15.875
She could still be out here.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.041
She died on tour.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.583
Hotel fire.

02:26.583 --> 02:29.916
So, if you're not trying
to find her out here,

02:29.916 --> 02:31.458
why did you come with us?

02:32.541 --> 02:34.833
She said The Road would save me.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.625
From what?

02:41.500 --> 02:42.541
[Agatha groans]

02:45.666 --> 02:46.666
Uh...

02:47.958 --> 02:49.708
RIP, Mrs. Hart.

02:52.708 --> 02:56.625
Well, shall we? All right.

03:04.791 --> 03:05.916
Okay.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.000
So, what's the problem now?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.083
A woman is dead, Agatha.

03:11.083 --> 03:14.458
Yes, and Alice and Teen
are kindly digging a grave for her.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.625
So, they'll catch up
when they can. <i>Vámonos.</i>

03:17.625 --> 03:18.708
[Agatha exclaims]

03:22.208 --> 03:23.541
Okay.

03:23.541 --> 03:26.125
Mrs. Hart was a bad draft pick, okay?

03:26.125 --> 03:29.958
Of course, The Road killed her.
More power for the rest of us.

03:29.958 --> 03:33.000
Setting aside your staggering callousness,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.291
we still have the issue
of our incomplete coven.

03:36.458 --> 03:39.708
Oh. Okay. Yes.
Okay, now I know the confusion.

03:39.708 --> 03:43.125
We needed the whole gang
to access The Road.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.458
But after that, it's anybody's game.

03:46.458 --> 03:49.000
It's like the Ballad says,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.541
"Burn and brew, with coven two,
and glory shall be thine." [chuckles]

03:53.541 --> 03:57.916
The Ballad clearly says,
"With coven true, glory shall be thine."

03:57.916 --> 04:01.833
- [laughs] Does it? It's "Coven two."
- That doesn't make any sense.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.583
Does if you're a student of the Ballad.

04:03.583 --> 04:07.333
Her mother recorded
the most popular version of the Ballad.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.375
- So, maybe we ask Alice?
- Okay.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.666
How many witches left The Road
with you last time?

04:27.708 --> 04:30.333
Well, whatever.
We still need a Green Witch.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.166
We would not have survived the last trial
without my expertise.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.708
Not all of us did.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.041
Well, where were you
when Mrs. Hart needed protecting?

04:38.041 --> 04:39.291
According to my count,

04:39.291 --> 04:43.291
Mrs. Hart drank two glasses
of the poisoned wine.

04:43.291 --> 04:47.958
How many doses of the antidote
did she get, Potions Witch?

04:47.958 --> 04:49.416
- This is your fault.
- Okay, wow.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.666
- Ooh!
- It's everybody's fault.

04:52.416 --> 04:55.000
We were supposed to look out
for each other, but we didn't.

04:56.833 --> 04:58.333
That was our fatal mistake.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.125
- Most fatal for Mrs. Hart.
- [scoffs]

05:03.250 --> 05:04.333
I wish we could go home.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.291
We can't. We can't go back.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.083
And we shouldn't go forward.
Not without a replacement Green Witch.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.541
- People can't be replaced.
- Can't they?

05:18.166 --> 05:23.166
What if we summon a backup Green Witch?

05:23.166 --> 05:24.833
To The Road?

05:24.833 --> 05:27.166
There is so much that could go wrong.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.833
So much has already gone wrong.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.916
I mean, aren't we all coven-less witches

05:32.916 --> 05:37.583
and by extension,
we're rule-breakers? Right?

05:37.583 --> 05:40.750
I guess we just have to be careful,
and specific, but mostly careful.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.416
Yes. Well said.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.416
Now, anybody got a spell book?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Ah!

05:47.083 --> 05:48.500
- [Lilia] Yeah. Okay.
- [Agatha chuckles]

05:51.458 --> 05:52.458
[chanting in Latin]

06:05.875 --> 06:10.250
[in English] May she be strong and wise,
and the best at her craft.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.833
May she be smart and not annoying.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.708
And also, not super political.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.541
May she be pleasant looking.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.250
- Can she bring some Advil?
- [Lilia scoffs]

06:38.708 --> 06:40.666
Yes. Okay.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.083
[chanting in Latin]

06:51.875 --> 06:52.875
[wind whooshing]

06:57.500 --> 06:58.500
[gasps sharply]

06:59.416 --> 07:00.541
[in English] Now what?

07:01.291 --> 07:02.333
Now we wait.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.166
True witchcraft takes time.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.375
The spell must marinate, gestate...

07:10.750 --> 07:12.750
[all gasp and scream]

07:14.708 --> 07:16.083
[Jen] Agatha, what did you do?

07:16.083 --> 07:19.375
What do you mean, what did I do?
This was very clearly a group effort.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.583
[Teen] Oh, my God,
did we turn Mrs. Hart into a zombie?

07:21.583 --> 07:24.708
- What spell did we cast?
- Why is the print so small?

07:25.291 --> 07:27.166
[Teen] Mrs. Hart, is that you?

07:27.666 --> 07:29.916
[gasps and sighs]

07:33.833 --> 07:35.375
Heard you guys were having a party.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.333
- How did you...
- I was in the neighborhood. [gasps]

07:41.666 --> 07:44.333
Surprise. My lady.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.208
[screams]

07:46.208 --> 07:48.083
- [Jen] We just summoned her.
- [Alice] We need her.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.208
What are you doing?

07:57.416 --> 07:59.958
- [Teen] Agatha, wait.
- [grunts]

08:03.000 --> 08:05.208
What's up? I'm Rio.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.291
- Hello.
- What's up?

08:06.291 --> 08:07.708
Hey.

08:08.291 --> 08:12.291
- [grunts]
- So, you're a Green Witch?

08:12.708 --> 08:15.583
Um... Less "a" Green Witch.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.291
More [in demonic voice] "the" Green Witch.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.083
[in normal voice]
We're supposed to walk this thing, right?

08:22.083 --> 08:23.208
- Yeah.
- Right this way.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.625
- Yes, we are.
- [Rio] Yeah?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.083
Wow. Witches' Road, huh? Okay.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
[whistling]

08:32.250 --> 08:34.666
Hmm. Yeah, this is cool.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.166
So, the dangerous-but-charismatic lady
is back.

08:43.166 --> 08:46.041
- [groans]
- Do you wanna talk about it?

08:47.208 --> 08:48.875
Are we in trouble, Agatha?

08:49.458 --> 08:51.500
Like, more than we were ten minutes ago?

08:54.583 --> 08:56.375
Oh, wow.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.958
Check it out. Hmm!

09:01.666 --> 09:04.041
So, what do we think? Can we trust her?

09:04.041 --> 09:05.666
We know nothing about her.

09:05.666 --> 09:09.041
We know Agatha hates her.
I'd say that goes in the "pro" column.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.916
[chuckles]

09:11.666 --> 09:13.583
Honestly, I don't know how to feel.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.583
Do I hate her?
Or do I want her phone number?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.041
- Same.
- Right?

09:18.041 --> 09:19.291
- [exclaims]
- Yeah. I mean...

09:19.291 --> 09:20.750
- Hello. Hi. How you doin'?
- Hello.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.125
Hello.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.333
[Rio chuckles]

09:24.500 --> 09:26.208
What a scary bitch.

09:29.416 --> 09:31.458
[♪ mystical music playing]

09:39.625 --> 09:40.875
Here we go again.

09:43.916 --> 09:44.916
Pass.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.708
[gasps] A mutiny already?

09:48.708 --> 09:50.333
[Agatha sighs] Alice.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Alice.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.708
What's the plan, Alice?

09:55.708 --> 09:58.875
Go back. Go around.
Go anywhere but in that house.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.125
- [gasps]
- [♪ mystical music playing]

10:02.833 --> 10:08.583
Uh... I agree,
but The Road clearly does not.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.541
So, I guess we go.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.708
Waxing moon.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.083
The fire phase.

10:39.791 --> 10:41.000
[sighs heavily]

10:48.875 --> 10:49.875
Okay.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.291
Come on.

11:04.791 --> 11:07.333
Don't drink anything. Don't eat anything.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.708
Don't touch anything.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.958
Feels like there's a story there.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.208
Oh, check me out.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.416
Whew!

11:20.791 --> 11:24.125
I mean, seriously.
We're an album cover waiting to happen.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.458
The Road changes for the coven.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.291
The Road isn't subtle.

11:29.791 --> 11:31.208
What happens next?

11:32.791 --> 11:33.958
A test.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.125
No cheating this time.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.958
Uh, <i>moi?</i>

11:38.916 --> 11:40.041
Ooh!

11:41.375 --> 11:42.708
[Lilia] Yes, Teen?

11:42.708 --> 11:45.416
I was just thinking about the invite
on the mantel.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.583
Maybe there is, like, a riddle
or a kickoff for this one, too.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.666
Ooh.

11:52.833 --> 11:53.875
Okay.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.125
Boo. [chuckles]

12:08.000 --> 12:09.083
No.

12:31.666 --> 12:34.166
- [womens' screams echoing]
- [whimpers softly]

13:17.958 --> 13:22.083
She was trying to open The Road,
wasn't she? With her concerts.

13:23.958 --> 13:25.875
Her fans were her coven.

13:29.666 --> 13:31.541
Two years after this tour,

13:32.125 --> 13:34.375
she had to sell the catalogue
to keep our house.

13:37.791 --> 13:40.583
Which is it? Am I wispy or am I kooky?

13:41.625 --> 13:44.083
Uh, a bit of both if I'm honest.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.416
Alice.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.041
- Alice, don't.
- Don't what?

13:50.083 --> 13:52.458
- Pardon?
- Don't what?

13:53.208 --> 13:54.458
Don't what what?

13:55.541 --> 13:56.541
What...

14:05.125 --> 14:06.125
[sighs]

14:12.375 --> 14:13.416
[Rio] Knock, knock.

14:15.958 --> 14:17.791
How's the quest for power going?

14:18.916 --> 14:20.000
It's going.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.000
Who are these people?

14:23.125 --> 14:25.708
- Oh, they're my new best friends.
- Mmm.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.500
I'm feeling impatient.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.500
I'm feeling like
I wanna cause some damage.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.166
You're too early.

14:36.541 --> 14:37.833
It wasn't up to me.

14:39.375 --> 14:44.875
Magick, as it does,
took the path of least resistance,

14:44.875 --> 14:49.083
ferried the closest,
most appropriate candidate down. Or up.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.458
Hmm.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.250
Why did you bring that boy?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.416
Oh...

15:00.500 --> 15:01.750
Many hands.

15:10.416 --> 15:12.750
Maybe The Road is like Switzerland.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.750
What if we just call a truce?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.416
Just... I don't know.

15:20.416 --> 15:24.500
Just one more big adventure.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.083
- You and me.
- Like old times?

15:28.750 --> 15:30.166
Work and play.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.416
It could be nice, right?

15:37.250 --> 15:39.708
I just need these witches
to get me to the end.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.791
So, you tell me.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.666
What happens next?

15:49.166 --> 15:51.583
- [feedback screeches over PA]
- [Rio over PA] <i>I get the pleasure</i>

15:51.583 --> 15:54.083
of watching you do what you do best.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.291
Which is?

15:56.833 --> 15:58.583
Kill all the witches around you.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.750
<i>One by one.</i>

16:02.375 --> 16:03.416
Then what?

16:03.416 --> 16:05.250
You get your power

16:06.666 --> 16:08.083
<i>and I get my bodies.</i>

16:09.125 --> 16:12.791
[gasps] Hey!
That's my coven you're talking about.

16:12.791 --> 16:15.041
I'm not that kind of witch anymore.

16:16.541 --> 16:17.666
- [Jen] I knew it!
- Shit.

16:17.666 --> 16:19.750
- What does she mean?
- [Alice] What is she talking about?

16:20.416 --> 16:22.208
- [shrill noise plays]
- [all shriek in pain]

16:22.208 --> 16:24.041
[distorted song plays over speaker]

16:24.041 --> 16:25.125
What is that?

16:25.125 --> 16:26.958
I'm sorry. I thought it was a clue.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.333
What made you think that?

16:33.041 --> 16:34.333
It's spinning backwards.

16:34.916 --> 16:36.875
[demonic voice speaking indistinctly]

16:39.666 --> 16:41.958
[all screaming]

16:42.416 --> 16:44.250
- Make it stop!
- Stop it. Turn it off!

16:46.875 --> 16:48.541
- [voice stops]
- [distorted song stops]

16:53.208 --> 16:54.291
We've been cursed.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.583
[metronome ticking]

17:04.916 --> 17:07.416
I think this means the trial started.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.625
Why are you smiling?

17:09.625 --> 17:12.208
- She's a tourist.
- She's a psycho.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.333
[Teen] And nothing's happening.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.500
Maybe this curse isn't so bad.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.708
Does anybody feel...

17:26.041 --> 17:27.041
What?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.500
I feel lighter.

17:37.958 --> 17:40.500
- [sizzling]
- [gasps and yelps]

17:41.166 --> 17:43.250
- [Lilia screams]
- What is it, Lilia? What's wrong?

17:45.583 --> 17:46.708
It burns!

17:46.708 --> 17:48.916
- What's doing that to her?
- How do we stop it?

17:48.916 --> 17:50.791
[Jen] Alice, protect her.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.166
Can I borrow this?

17:53.291 --> 17:56.000
- [chanting in Latin]
- [in English] Get it off me!

17:56.583 --> 17:58.916
It burns. It burns.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.458
[gasps]

18:04.750 --> 18:06.708
[groans]

18:08.958 --> 18:11.458
I need you to draw
one of those circles around me, right now.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.375
- Are you okay?
- [Teen] So, breaking a curse.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.416
Smudge sticks? A salt bath?

18:16.416 --> 18:19.583
What if we locate and reason with
the witch who cast the curse?

18:19.583 --> 18:23.375
Once vengeance is loosed,
you can't reel it back in.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.125
So what do we do?

18:25.625 --> 18:28.666
The only way to end a curse is to face it.

18:31.916 --> 18:33.000
[screams]

18:33.000 --> 18:34.083
No!

18:35.666 --> 18:38.666
- [chanting in Latin]
- [in English] Faster!

18:44.000 --> 18:45.541
[panting]

18:46.708 --> 18:48.291
Her shoulders.

18:51.916 --> 18:53.916
[Jen exclaims]

18:55.875 --> 18:57.375
Do I have one, too?

19:07.083 --> 19:08.791
[rumbling in distance]

19:08.791 --> 19:09.958
Do you hear that?

19:11.916 --> 19:14.583
- [gasps]
- [witch shrieking]

19:14.583 --> 19:15.708
What is that?

19:17.166 --> 19:18.375
That's the curse.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.208
The backwards record.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.708
[Lilia] What's the song forwards?

19:32.291 --> 19:34.208
It's you, isn't it?
You brought it in here.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.500
[Teen] Leave her alone, Agatha.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.000
I didn't think it was real.

19:37.666 --> 19:40.166
I thought it was me, that it's my fault

19:40.166 --> 19:43.375
that I can't keep a job,

19:43.375 --> 19:46.041
that everything I touch turns to shit,

19:46.958 --> 19:50.083
that I couldn't save her.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.875
I convinced myself they were birthmarks.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.375
Even though she had the same ones.

20:13.458 --> 20:16.583
Wait, are we talking
about a generational curse?

20:16.583 --> 20:18.750
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Poor us!

20:18.750 --> 20:20.708
Now we have her family's old-ass curse!

20:21.875 --> 20:22.916
I'm sorry.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.416
[grunts]

20:28.750 --> 20:31.250
- [yells and grunts]
- [women scream]

20:35.500 --> 20:36.500
[Teen] Ow!

20:39.166 --> 20:40.291
Hey.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.916
I got attacked by the curse.

20:43.750 --> 20:47.958
Does that mean I'm part of the coven?
Blessings and burdens alike.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.833
Not a lot of blessings with this group.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.041
[Jen] Is he okay?

20:58.083 --> 21:00.083
[scoffs] So what?
You live in that circle now?

21:00.083 --> 21:01.208
Maybe.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.375
You look okay. Are you okay?

21:03.916 --> 21:05.041
What's the plan, Agatha?

21:05.750 --> 21:07.416
[ticking continues]

21:11.250 --> 21:13.958
You're right. That's the solution.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.750
- No, it's not.
- [Agatha] Mmm.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.916
What?

21:17.916 --> 21:19.916
We have to play Lorna's Ballad.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.000
I'm not playing that song.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.458
All signs point to a jam session.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.458
What good will it do?

21:26.458 --> 21:29.750
The Ballad opens The Road.
We did that. We're here.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.166
Lorna's version is different, though.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.083
What did Lorna want from The Road?

21:36.416 --> 21:38.375
What was her intention?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.375
To save her daughter.

21:44.750 --> 21:48.625
You should have burnt to a crisp years ago
but here you are.

21:48.625 --> 21:51.166
Sullen and aimless, but alive.

21:51.791 --> 21:53.375
That's because at any given moment

21:53.375 --> 21:57.875
somewhere, someone is playing
that song that you hate so much.

21:59.291 --> 22:02.750
Lorna's Ballad is a protection spell.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.958
It protected you.

22:07.958 --> 22:09.916
And maybe now it can protect us.

22:09.916 --> 22:11.916
[witch shrieking]

22:12.875 --> 22:15.958
Okay, who's good on piano? Lilia?

22:15.958 --> 22:19.875
No. No, I studied the zils.
And a little pan flute.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.416
- Okay. Jen.
- Ballet.

22:21.416 --> 22:22.541
Oh, come on, guys!

22:22.541 --> 22:24.958
- I play guitar. Sort of.
- [Agatha] Okay, great.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.166
Jen, you're on bass.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.791
- I'm still in the circle...
- Jen!

22:28.583 --> 22:30.833
Well, what do you know? Zils.

22:32.041 --> 22:34.875

28:42.916 --> 28:43.958
Look what you did.

28:56.916 --> 28:59.333
[Jen] We should move him
somewhere more comfortable.

28:59.333 --> 29:00.458
[Agatha] Yeah.

29:17.375 --> 29:19.583
[Jen] I never really identified
as just a witch.

29:20.916 --> 29:25.000
I'm an 11th-generation root worker
and midwife.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.375
A midwife...

29:26.375 --> 29:27.625
How were you bound?

29:28.416 --> 29:32.791
I was invited to the brand-new
Obstetrics Association of Greater Boston.

29:33.541 --> 29:35.791
To share my expertise.

29:37.666 --> 29:38.708
It was a trap.

29:40.833 --> 29:43.125
I still don't know how he did it.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.083
Bound me without magick.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.583
So much for "Do no harm."

29:54.666 --> 29:55.875
When Mom died,

29:57.875 --> 30:01.250
I stopped believing
everything she ever taught me.

30:02.708 --> 30:05.666
I was so angry.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.750
Part of me hoped
that The Road wasn't real,

30:11.750 --> 30:13.458
so I could stay angry.

30:15.416 --> 30:16.416
Because...

30:16.416 --> 30:19.500
Now you know. It was all for you.

30:22.750 --> 30:23.875
And that makes you sad.

30:25.708 --> 30:26.708
You're right.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.875
Sad is better than angry.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.708
Here. Put this on your pressure points.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.333
Why?

30:41.583 --> 30:43.041

30:44.666 --> 30:47.000
[Lilia] You know,
the worst part of being a witch?

30:47.000 --> 30:51.375
All the misconceptions
and rumor mongering.

30:51.375 --> 30:52.500
That we talk to goats.

30:53.708 --> 30:56.083
That we've all got an extra nipple.

30:56.083 --> 30:59.416
You guys don't have extra nipples?
I'm covered in nipples.

30:59.416 --> 31:01.791
- You wanna see?
- [Lilia] No, thank you.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.041
[women chuckle]

31:14.958 --> 31:17.583
Still alive. Great.

31:20.666 --> 31:21.666
Agatha.

31:25.166 --> 31:26.458
Did you put the sigil on me?

31:29.500 --> 31:30.500
No.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.583
Actually, I wouldn't know.

31:37.416 --> 31:40.375
A sigil works on the witch
who cast it as well.

31:40.375 --> 31:43.166
That's why we don't use them as much.
They're super irritating.

31:44.291 --> 31:45.375
Can it be lifted?

31:47.666 --> 31:51.041
Sigils are destroyed. Not lifted.

31:51.958 --> 31:56.291
And before you ask, "How?"
in that curious little voice of yours...

31:58.458 --> 32:00.958
The answer is
when they're no longer needed.

32:08.208 --> 32:11.166
You don't have to know a person's name
to know who they are.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.833
Careful you don't say
something nice to me.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.208
Oh, I won't.

32:22.750 --> 32:23.750
Agatha...

32:27.750 --> 32:29.208
What really happened to your son?

32:37.916 --> 32:41.166
Heal fast. We're not staying here long.

32:48.541 --> 32:49.916
[Lilia] Check this out.

32:50.791 --> 32:53.208
- What is that?
- Vampire bite.

32:53.208 --> 32:56.000
Right before I knocked out
his other tooth.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.541
- Oh!
- [women laugh]

32:57.541 --> 33:00.750
You know, we really
kind of hated each other in the beginning.

33:00.750 --> 33:01.833
But now...

33:04.625 --> 33:06.750
- But now?
- Huh?

33:07.291 --> 33:10.333
- Lilia, where do you go?
- [chuckles]

33:18.333 --> 33:19.541
How is he?

33:20.333 --> 33:22.625
- Mouthy.
- [Lilia] That's a good sign.

33:24.916 --> 33:28.458
Agatha, why don't you show us
your battle scars?

33:33.958 --> 33:35.041
- Well...
- [Rio chuckles]

33:38.250 --> 33:41.083
- Knitting needle to the elbow.
- [groans]

33:41.083 --> 33:43.083
You ever hear of the Daughters of Liberty?

33:43.083 --> 33:44.291
- No.
- No.

33:44.291 --> 33:45.375
Exactly.

33:45.375 --> 33:47.500
[all laugh]

33:53.750 --> 33:55.000
I've got a scar.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.500
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

33:59.666 --> 34:04.250
A long time ago, I loved someone.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.666
And I had to do something
that I did not wanna do,

34:08.666 --> 34:10.166
even though it was my job.

34:13.583 --> 34:14.708
And it hurt them.

34:22.583 --> 34:23.833
She is my scar.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.916
I'm gonna stretch my legs. [exhales]

34:40.541 --> 34:41.875
[Rio clears throat]

34:43.666 --> 34:47.416
Don't think for a second I've forgotten
what you said in the sound booth.

34:48.583 --> 34:50.666
[scoffs and hisses]

35:05.666 --> 35:06.791
[Agatha moans softly]

35:34.166 --> 35:35.250
Agatha?

35:40.541 --> 35:41.791
That boy isn't yours.

36:10.125 --> 36:12.125
[♪ dramatic music playing]
