"A great civilization is not conquered from without
until it has destroyed itself from within." W. Durant.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.119
The heart...

03:31.086 --> 03:32.504
<i>for Smoke Frog.</i>

03:32.587 --> 03:33.838
Thank you.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.055
This liver for Curl Nose.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
Thank you.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.188
<i>Cocoa Leaf...</i>

03:50.355 --> 03:51.523
the ears.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.982
Thank you.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.403
And for you Blunted...

04:00.198 --> 04:01.825
<i>the balls.</i>

04:05.120 --> 04:06.246
Not this again.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.705
I'm helping you.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.040
Then you eat them!

04:09.207 --> 04:11.543
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.669
Do you fellows?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.503
No.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.546
Of course not!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.880
Sometimes!

04:16.089 --> 04:17.089
What do you think?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.048
No!

04:18.132 --> 04:19.132
No, no!

04:19.634 --> 04:21.386
But how many times does it take?

04:21.636 --> 04:24.264
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.017
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.934
Shall I tell him?

05:11.978 --> 05:14.272
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.734
You've never had them?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.486
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.614
None of you?

05:24.616 --> 05:27.285
No, but it's been fun watching you...

05:33.124 --> 05:34.125
This was your idea!

05:37.128 --> 05:38.421
Get him off me!

05:45.303 --> 05:46.930
Calm down!

06:04.364 --> 06:07.325
Why do you let them treat you like this?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.369
Be strong.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.454
Where is your pride?

06:16.501 --> 06:19.545
It all works... Yes?

06:23.007 --> 06:24.175
<i>Yes...</i>

06:24.717 --> 06:27.512
<i>I</i> just can't make children.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.520
There is something I will tell you...

06:36.187 --> 06:39.482
but I warn you, it's very powerful.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.109
What do you speak of?

06:42.694 --> 06:44.320
The soanzo leaf.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.073
The soanzo leaf?

06:47.365 --> 06:50.034
From the great marshes in the south...

06:54.872 --> 06:57.875
This is what gave me my ten children.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.426
<i>No'. No'. Wait...</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:10.096
You have to rub them on... down there.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.057
Just before you next try.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.393
Apply it generously...

07:19.981 --> 07:22.066
I don't know how to thank you.

07:24.068 --> 07:27.238
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.740
Your wife?

07:29.240 --> 07:31.075
No, her mother.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.786
The old hag wants grandchildren.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.922
Give me some meat.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.425
<i>Here, work</i> on <i>this...</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:49.635
<i>pure meat...</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:53.639
<i>ball breath.</i>

08:58.079 --> 08:59.205
What do you want?

09:03.668 --> 09:04.961
What do you want?

10:00.433 --> 10:05.605
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

10:07.106 --> 10:11.527
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.072
Jaguar Paw, my son.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.742
He hunts this forest with me.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.747
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.268
A good catch?

10:45.102 --> 10:47.104
Good waters here.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.234
The forest gives much here.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.283
We ask only to pass through.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.452
Pass.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.126
Keep safe as you pass.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.340
Let's go.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.337
Our lands were ravaged.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.132
We seek a new beginning.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.682
Your lands were ravaged?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.021
<i>Yes...</i>

12:11.355 --> 12:14.025
We seek a new beginning...

12:14.609 --> 12:15.860
Be still.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.110
MY Son!

12:19.030 --> 12:20.323
Be still.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.746
Back to the village.

13:00.488 --> 13:05.409
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.415
You are troubled.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.417
Yes, I am.

13:29.934 --> 13:34.063
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

13:34.605 --> 13:35.773
I do not understand.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.317
Fean.

13:41.612 --> 13:44.615
Deep rotting fear.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.743
They were infected by it.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.912
Did you see?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.623
Fear is a sickness.

13:57.878 --> 14:02.007
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.972
It has tainted your peace already.

14:10.182 --> 14:14.311
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.524
Strike it from your heart.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.444
Do not bring it into our village.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.614
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

14:26.490 --> 14:29.660
<i>at</i> the sacred hill of our fathers.

14:30.411 --> 14:34.665
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.553
Oh, here he is!

14:48.512 --> 14:49.847
The big lump!

14:50.681 --> 14:52.183
He's useless.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.351
He can't do it.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.688
You! Yes you!

14:58.397 --> 15:01.817
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.153
Get inside!

15:09.700 --> 15:11.202
Damn you! Get in there!

15:11.535 --> 15:13.037
Old woman, please.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.454
Move it!

15:18.793 --> 15:20.252
You don't work!

15:22.797 --> 15:24.256
What are you laughing about?

15:32.223 --> 15:36.727
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.772
Mother, that's enough.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.901
Do not come out until you make a child.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.071
Two would be better!

15:47.321 --> 15:48.321
What?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.909
Twins you oaf.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.668
Mother.

16:02.419 --> 16:06.757
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.551
Lust get busy.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.095
<i>Mom...</i>

16:15.766 --> 16:17.226
She's gone.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.522
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

17:03.814 --> 17:06.483
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

17:07.192 --> 17:07.943
I say bOY-

17:08.152 --> 17:09.152
Roasted!

17:09.319 --> 17:11.946
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.282
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

17:14.491 --> 17:17.286
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

17:20.830 --> 17:21.540
<i>Wait...</i>

17:21.749 --> 17:24.627
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.296
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

17:28.172 --> 17:31.508
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

17:35.095 --> 17:37.389
and a crush for my youngest.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.018
Tapir it is.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.544
One day, old man!

18:49.086 --> 18:51.422
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

19:09.106 --> 19:12.276
And a Man sat alone.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.238
Drenched deep in sadness.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.742
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

19:20.367 --> 19:24.163
"We do not like to see you so sad..."

19:25.956 --> 19:29.418
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

19:30.461 --> 19:34.798
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

19:36.216 --> 19:39.428
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

19:42.473 --> 19:45.642
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

19:49.354 --> 19:51.148
The jaguar said:

19:53.484 --> 19:56.445
"You shall be strong like me."

19:58.405 --> 20:04.286
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

20:05.829 --> 20:10.834
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

20:12.711 --> 20:15.214
And so it went with all the animals.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.676
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

20:19.843 --> 20:21.512
<i>he left.</i>

20:23.055 --> 20:25.349
Then the owl said to the other animals:

20:26.266 --> 20:30.145
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things..."

20:31.230 --> 20:34.566
"Suddenly I am afraid."

20:37.778 --> 20:40.572
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

20:41.698 --> 20:43.700
"Now his sadness will stop."

20:44.368 --> 20:46.370
But the owl replied: "No."

20:49.039 --> 20:51.875
"I saw a hole in the Man...

20:52.876 --> 20:56.672
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill..."

20:57.714 --> 21:02.219
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

21:05.472 --> 21:08.559
"He will go on taking and taking...

21:09.726 --> 21:12.938
"Until one day the World will say:"

21:13.730 --> 21:17.860
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

22:04.615 --> 22:06.450
Come back to <i>me...</i>

22:10.787 --> 22:12.623
Come back to me.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.528
My son is dancing.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.366
Your son is happy-

23:39.751 --> 23:41.420
What do you want?

23:57.436 --> 23:59.187
Run!

24:14.745 --> 24:18.749
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

24:31.928 --> 24:33.972
The dog.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.186
Get up! Get up! Now!

27:18.929 --> 27:20.555
Go to the forest.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.807
Run! Do not look back.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.460
No! No! I am afraid!

27:50.794 --> 27:52.837
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.256
Be strong...

27:54.673 --> 27:55.799
I am afraid!

27:56.383 --> 27:57.926
Be strong.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.359
Tie him up!

30:15.355 --> 30:16.398
Father!

30:17.774 --> 30:19.943
The others. I have to help.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.821
No, don't leave us!

30:23.113 --> 30:25.782
I will come back, I promise.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.283
Don't you leave!

30:27.617 --> 30:28.451
I promise.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.493
Stay, please stay.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.787
Father, don't go.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.803
Very nice.

32:15.809 --> 32:16.851
Stop!

32:25.652 --> 32:26.945
Tie him up!

32:31.324 --> 32:32.742
I want him alive.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.556
Sorry Father.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.577
That's enough!

33:26.170 --> 33:27.964
Stand him up.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.307
Move away.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.947
My son.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.627
Don't be afraid.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.396
<i>Almost...</i>

35:21.327 --> 35:23.913
<i>that's your name.</i>

35:24.914 --> 35:28.084
"Almost".

35:43.975 --> 35:46.436
Our life is over.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.151
<i>Shame...</i>

36:01.200 --> 36:02.452
Shame!

36:06.622 --> 36:08.666
Cowards!

39:42.338 --> 39:44.131
Let's move!

42:03.813 --> 42:05.147
We move out now.

42:05.564 --> 42:06.982
They are back.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.362
Get up!

42:14.156 --> 42:15.616
Heave!

42:22.832 --> 42:25.543
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.839
Hold still.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.683
Can you see?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.102
Yes.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.313
Get back to your line.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.918
<i>Come with us...</i>

44:41.303 --> 44:42.471
Get up.

44:55.067 --> 44:57.319
E h' lm alone "A <i>'</i> ll11Qstn."

44:59.488 --> 45:01.365
I said get up.

45:29.935 --> 45:31.687
<i>Up, up...</i>

45:32.187 --> 45:33.731
<i>that's it.</i>

45:35.858 --> 45:37.192
Let's go!

45:41.071 --> 45:43.991
This man is a good friend of yours...

46:18.901 --> 46:20.861
<i>Don't worry...</i>

46:24.406 --> 46:26.408
I'll take care of them.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.622
They are mine now.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.966
Gentle Ixchel. Tender mother of mercy.

46:44.802 --> 46:49.932
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.469
One more.

47:51.076 --> 47:52.786
Ready?

48:53.722 --> 48:55.265
Hold on! Hold on!

48:59.228 --> 49:00.771
<i>Wait...</i>

49:02.314 --> 49:04.107
let's see what happens.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.115
That's it!

49:20.249 --> 49:21.458
Hurry!

49:22.417 --> 49:24.378
Pull! Be strong!

49:43.438 --> 49:45.274
Yes! You did it!

49:49.111 --> 49:50.779
Good work!

50:03.625 --> 50:06.336
<i>Can you breathe?...Good.</i>

50:36.158 --> 50:37.158
Wait here.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.069
What's become of my capture?

51:15.864 --> 51:17.324
Dead weight.

51:19.034 --> 51:21.244
He nearly took the rest with him.

51:23.538 --> 51:25.207
I let him go.

51:29.461 --> 51:31.213
You. Let him go?

51:38.261 --> 51:41.765
Shall we now do what you want?

51:46.103 --> 51:49.064
Let us try that.

52:12.337 --> 52:15.132
Don't let any others go.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.098
Let's move.

52:38.363 --> 52:40.490
Get up "Almost".

52:41.616 --> 52:45.162
We don't want to lose you just yet.

53:35.337 --> 53:37.339
Stand up, boy.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.642
You proved yourself today, my son.

53:49.351 --> 53:53.146
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

53:55.690 --> 53:58.235
Thank you Father.

54:08.286 --> 54:09.704
<i>Take it...</i>

54:10.413 --> 54:11.665
<i>it's yours.</i>

54:15.752 --> 54:18.380
It has taken many lives.

54:30.767 --> 54:32.227
Get some rest.

54:46.741 --> 54:47.909
<i>Resting brothers...</i>

54:48.160 --> 54:51.538
<i>fathers, mothers, wives.</i>

54:52.581 --> 54:56.751
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

54:57.669 --> 55:01.882
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

55:04.593 --> 55:06.595
She stopped screaming...

55:08.763 --> 55:11.766
too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.270
We saw how she fought them.

55:16.313 --> 55:18.148
But in the final moment?

55:19.774 --> 55:21.651
If she let them...

55:24.321 --> 55:28.950
<i>the</i> Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

55:30.994 --> 55:35.457
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

55:46.635 --> 55:48.345
I need to know.

55:49.846 --> 55:54.643
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

55:56.561 --> 56:02.025
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

56:04.361 --> 56:09.157
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

56:11.326 --> 56:14.704
<i>if</i> I do not find my Sky Flower there.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.213
Don't rain.

57:06.548 --> 57:08.383
I am walking here.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.209
Keep away, she has the sickness.

58:08.777 --> 58:10.445
Get back!

59:03.331 --> 59:05.500
You fear me?

59:06.876 --> 59:09.504
So you should...

59:10.171 --> 59:13.550
all you who are vile.

59:16.594 --> 59:20.140
Would you like to know how you will die?

59:27.188 --> 59:31.025
The sacred time is near...

59:33.194 --> 59:37.365
Beware the blackness of day.

59:40.535 --> 59:45.331
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

59:48.209 --> 59:52.881
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

59:53.965 --> 59:59.846
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.850
and scratch out the earth.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.270
Scratch you out.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.232
And end your world.

01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:20.950
He's with us now.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.752
Day will be like night.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:35.882
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:49.122
Where are they taking us?

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:57.839
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.883
What happens there?

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.219
I do not know...

01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:08.308
but the earth bleeds.

01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:13.229
We are near.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.564
Salvation!

01:02:57.148 --> 01:03:00.234
He has the laughing sickness.

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:03.237
He likes you!

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.075
Help me!

01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:17.251
Save me.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.761
Die like a man.

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.422
Welcome back.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:11.050
Have you been successful?

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:12.760
Ask my son.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.055
How many captives?

01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:17.265
Deal with my son.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.434
A fair price.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.604
As always, trust me.

01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:25.438
Good.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.668
How much will you give me?

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.315
Who will buy this woman?

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:51.734
No... she's too old.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.862
She can be useful.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.073
<i>She can cook... clean...</i>

01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.701
Useless old woman!

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.873
No sale.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.005
Go!

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.383
Go on.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:20.479
These are the days of our great lament.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.860
The land thirsts.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.701
A great plague infests our crops.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:40.582
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:50.217
They say this strife has made us weak.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.263
That we have become empty.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:59.351
They say that we rot.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:13.907
Great people of the banner of the sun...

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.243
I say...

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.246
we are strong.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.794
We are a people of destiny.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:33.886
Destined to be the masters of time.

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:41.226
Destined to be nearest to the gods.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.287
Mighty Kukulkan!

01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:06.460
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:11.423
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.801
To exalt you in your glory.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.304
To make our people prosper.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:21.141
To prepare for your return.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.980
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.858
With your blood you renew the world!

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:32.194
From age to age.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.280
Thanks be to you.

01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:52.172
The heart of god!

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:38.171
Come back to me.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.974
Brother...

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.686
Journey well...

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:55.855
No.

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.358
I can't go.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:01.486
Not <i>now...</i>

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:26.047
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:28.842
Rejoice!

01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:33.138
Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:36.308
We have sated his thirst.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.144
Great god.

01:21:40.103 --> 01:21:42.355
Show us that you are pleased.

01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:46.193
Let your light return upon us.

01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:53.635
What of these captives?

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.267
Dispose of them.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.845
I need a finisher.

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:43.184
You.

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.859
Release them.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.785
You watch.

01:24:21.681 --> 01:24:22.724
I'm ready!

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.690
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

01:24:33.693 --> 01:24:35.070
Go to it.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.322
You're free...

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.533
<i>now</i> run.

01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:45.205
I said run.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:50.877
Run!

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:05.618
Not bad.

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:25.138
Your turn.

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.481
Run.

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.850
Run!

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.926
Sleep.

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:11.137
Sleep, sleep now my son.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.515
The pain will be no more.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:17.769
Sleep.

01:35:07.827 --> 01:35:09.996
He didn't come this way.

01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:25.219
He's in the trees.

01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:28.222
Spread out.

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.641
Keep your eyes up.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:54.081
Quiet.

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:06.886
He's coming right at us.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.611
There!

01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:25.232
He would have wanted me to have it.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:30.362
The omen is bad...

01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:35.367
Mighty Ek Chuah we beg you...

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:40.873
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the jaguar.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.377
The omen is bad...

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:49.048
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:52.927
the omen was foretold...

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:58.516
and now we have a fear more grave...

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:02.895
today I saw the day
become like night...

01:39:09.401 --> 01:39:13.072
I saw a man run with the jaguar...

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:21.080
we must not let this man
make feet from us.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:22.957
Enough.

01:39:26.752 --> 01:39:28.587
Your words mean nothing.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.216
He runs because he is afraid.

01:39:33.592 --> 01:39:37.221
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:42.977
and have him watch me wear it.

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:51.944
We leave now.

01:41:59.571 --> 01:42:00.739
Stay back.

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.811
Here!

01:43:37.377 --> 01:43:39.505
The omen was bad...

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:44.343
He's fucked.

01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:49.056
Help... please...

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.183
Hanging Moss...

01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:54.478
See him out.

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:18.585
Open your veins. It's quicker.

01:44:31.306 --> 01:44:33.392
Travel well.

01:47:39.244 --> 01:47:41.955
So much for your prophecies.

01:47:47.836 --> 01:47:49.087
It's not over!

01:48:15.113 --> 01:48:16.740
I am jaguar Paw...

01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:18.992
Son of Flint Sky...

01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:23.789
My father hunted
this forest before me...

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:27.501
My name is jaguar Paw.

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:29.961
I am a hunter.

01:48:31.546 --> 01:48:33.799
This is my forest.

01:48:34.966 --> 01:48:39.513
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:43.642
Come on!

01:48:46.311 --> 01:48:47.979
We are going over.

01:48:48.563 --> 01:48:51.316
We climb down around.

01:48:52.567 --> 01:48:54.653
We cannot let him get away.

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.488
We cannot afford...

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.844
We all jump.

01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:17.522
I am jaguar Paw.

01:52:19.357 --> 01:52:21.192
This is my forest.

01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:25.989
And I am not afraid.

01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.994
You go. I'll wait here.

02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:07.325
Almost...

02:00:34.185 --> 02:00:36.854
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

02:01:03.881 --> 02:01:05.675
Get up here.

02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:22.108
Go back!

02:01:51.512 --> 02:01:52.512
Quick!

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:53.805
Hurry up!

02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:22.486
What are they?

02:08:24.154 --> 02:08:25.990
They bring men.

02:08:30.661 --> 02:08:32.538
Should we go to them?

02:08:40.838 --> 02:08:42.673
We should go to the forest.

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.473
To seek a new beginning.

02:08:56.604 --> 02:08:58.022
Come Turtles Run...
