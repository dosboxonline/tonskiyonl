WEBVTT

00:03.587 --> 00:05.798
Damn, I love sitting
in the back seat.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.592
In the front,
you have to look
at the road,

00:08.718 --> 00:09.844
and I hate the road,

00:09.969 --> 00:12.471
with all its white lines
and yellow lines.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.931
Makes me sick.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.475
Front seat's
for athletes only.
Right, Steve?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.687
Who knew that when
you can't get on a
high school football team,

00:19.812 --> 00:21.939
you can get on
a community center
rugby team?

00:22.064 --> 00:23.983
Yep. I'm... I'm doing rugby.

00:24.108 --> 00:25.526
As... as a player.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.902
Touching the ball a lot,

00:27.027 --> 00:29.280
some... some scoring
when the time is right.

00:29.405 --> 00:32.742
Man, you can do anything
at the community center.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.453
I'm debating whether
I should join Mom
in butchering

00:35.578 --> 00:37.329
or Jeff in birdhouse building.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.082
The birds could really
use your help, babe.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.793
Did you know they sleep
on sticks and leaves?

00:42.918 --> 00:44.295
They're called nests, Jeff.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.756
And it's what
those chirpy-ass
sky rats deserve.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.507
You're in a bad mood, Klaus.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.134
You should try butchering.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.844
It's been helping
me with my...

00:51.969 --> 00:52.887
What's it called?

00:54.221 --> 00:55.806
Female rage.

00:55.931 --> 00:59.351
"The rage you feel
when bitches don't
mind their business."

01:00.895 --> 01:02.521
Can I help you?

01:02.646 --> 01:03.981
Oh, butchering it is.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.524
I'm in a bad mood

01:07.067 --> 01:08.235
because Buckle's playing oboe
in the community orchestra.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.695
That was my instrument.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.364
I didn't know you played
an instrument, Mr. Klaus.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.741
I don't.

01:15.117 --> 01:15.993
I only joined
because Danuta
plays the piccolo,

01:17.203 --> 01:18.162
which sits right next
to the oboe section,

01:18.287 --> 01:19.663
but Buckle took the oboe,

01:19.789 --> 01:21.373
so now I'm playing
the trombone,

01:21.499 --> 01:23.584
which is a million miles
away from piccolo.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.545
Wow, Klaus. Please
give us more details
about the orchestra

01:26.670 --> 01:28.297
and all the sitting
around you do.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.466
I've been
looking for a reason
to drive off a bridge.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.051
Jesus.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.262
Now, Steve,
I'm not super familiar
with European sports.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.847
I've heard of
the Eiffel Tower,

01:36.972 --> 01:38.557
but that's technically
more of a sex move.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.518
So fill me in.
Everything about rugby.

01:40.643 --> 01:41.685
- Go.
- Hup, we're here.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.897
Thanks for the ride, hon.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.900
Hey, Stan. I'm gonna go ahead

01:48.025 --> 01:50.444
and let you drop me off
in front of the building.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.405
I don't get it, Roger.
Why is Steve being
so weird with me?

01:53.531 --> 01:54.824
I wish I could help, Stan,

01:54.949 --> 01:57.076
but I'm deeply embedded
in this old persona,

01:57.201 --> 01:59.370
Maestro Gunter
Van Sliezebiscuit,

01:59.495 --> 02:01.455
and he only knows
about conducting.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.623
Now, we're here

02:03.791 --> 02:04.124
and you've come
safely to a stop, so...

02:09.255 --> 02:12.174
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:12.299 --> 02:15.678
<i>♪ I got a feeling

02:15.803 --> 02:18.556

<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:30.818 --> 02:31.735
Ah!

02:33.445 --> 02:36.448
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:43.372
All right, we've got a big,
big tour coming up,

02:43.497 --> 02:44.707
starting here tonight

02:46.041 --> 02:47.793
and ending at
the hottest venue
in town, the zoo.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.505
Danuta, are elephants
our favorite animal
at the zoo or what?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.882
- No.
- Damn it.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.009
You're in my spot,
golden fish.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.221
Let's warm up.
Hit it, sexy-phone.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.056
- Piccolo.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.475
- Oboe.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.227
I lost my oboe.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.438
This is a blow gun with holes.

03:09.773 --> 03:10.774
Trombone.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.401
Piece of crap.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.403
I can only reach one note.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.282
And now the soft
trill of harp.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.703
Okay, now everyone
shut the hell up.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.747
- Cello, take us home.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.713
Well, the boy's not
much to look at,

03:32.838 --> 03:34.632
but good damn,
can he play the cello.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.009
He's right. You're talented.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.053
You need to invite your dad
to the show tonight.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.430
No way. I can't invite Dad.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.350
I told him I'm playing rugby
and he's proud of me for it.

03:44.475 --> 03:47.061
He's proud
of a version of you
that doesn't exist.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.562
Why do you even care?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.731
Because, and this
goes for all of you,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.858
I'm not just
a conductor of music.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.860
I'm a conductor of life.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.404
Really? In that case,
my daughter stopped
speaking to me--

03:57.529 --> 03:59.531
A conductor
of Steve's life.
Just Steve.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.576
And, Steve, allow me
to conduct a warning.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.620
One, two, and tell your dad

04:04.745 --> 04:06.664
or daddy issues will
haunt you forever.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.375
Who did that?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.168
Jenny!

04:16.674 --> 04:19.927
Bird friends, say goodbye
to your pile of sticks

04:20.052 --> 04:22.805
and hello to your
new deluxe birdhouse.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.724
You'll notice
I put in some extras like
lighting and running water.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.767
Hope you like it.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.645
Mom, you got a little blood.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.771
Did I get it?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.314
They're moving in!

04:33.983 --> 04:35.150
Oh, wipe your feet.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.569
This is Brazilian Ipe wood.

04:37.695 --> 04:38.779
It's gorgeous,

04:38.904 --> 04:40.614
but it needs to
be oiled often.

04:40.739 --> 04:44.410
Hey, is that a cricket
in there? No pets.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.953
Oh, they ate it.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.371
That's natural.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.264
Roger,
you invited him?

05:05.389 --> 05:08.017
Yes. I'm conducting
your life. Now solo.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.026
Is that Steve? Is this rugby?

05:17.151 --> 05:19.319
Where are the Australians
and their beefy thighs?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.367
Lewis, not yet!

05:25.492 --> 05:27.619
It... it's not me,
it's the audience.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.248
Even Dad.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.670
That's my boy playing
the big-ass violin.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.130
He's proud of me.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.886
Daddy's not proud.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.473
<i>Maestro,
what are you doing?</i>

05:52.269 --> 05:54.146
I don't really like Steve.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.816
Good morning--

05:57.941 --> 05:59.568
Roger, you tried
to kill Steve.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
My Steve? This Steve?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.322
The Steve with the
big bandage on him?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.074
Yeah. You got me pretty good.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.368
You went totally berserk.
Like...

06:08.494 --> 06:10.496
Yes. Yeah.
It was just like that.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.456
It wasn't me,
it was my persona.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.250
He had a flashback to an
earlier time in his life.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.252
<i>- There was fire everywhere.</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:20.756
And I saw sheet music
for Dvorak's <i>Cello
Concerto in B Minor.</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:23.092
The same piece we were
playing at the concert.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.843
Exactly.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.221
I must have repressed
something horrible that
happened to the Maestro.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.932
It's rare, but sometimes
I'll embody a persona

06:30.057 --> 06:31.809
that experiences
their own trauma.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.436
I think the Maestro
has daddy issues.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.562
You said "Daddy"

06:36.688 --> 06:37.481
when you were in
your stabbing trance.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.024
Best kind of trance there is.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.860
You didn't attack
until Dad was
proud of me.

06:41.985 --> 06:42.945
That moment,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.571
combined with the music,

06:46.198 --> 06:47.199
must have triggered
your flashback and
subsequent violence.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.035
A musical genius
and a psychiatry whiz?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.870
What can't this boy do?

06:51.995 --> 06:54.665
Well, he's proud of you now,
and I'm not attacking you.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.874
What if I do this?

06:55.999 --> 06:58.085
<i>♪ My pride and joy ♪</i>

06:58.210 --> 06:59.586
I'll kill you!

06:59.711 --> 07:01.255
Whoa. I see your point.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.340
I guess I'll have to
retire this persona.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.842
- What?
- No.

07:06.343 --> 07:06.802
He's the reason
Steve and I are
finally connecting.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.472
Did you know Steve
likes black licorice?
How unique is that?

07:10.597 --> 07:11.974
I don't like to tell people.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.934
I don't need
the extra attention.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.104
We have to figure out
what happened to the Maestro
and his dad and fix it.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.523
We need you to
have more flashbacks.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.401
- Sounds a little
dangerous for you.
- Not at all.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.487
Dad will protect me
while you conduct
that Dvorak piece.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.740
Then we piece together
what happened to the Maestro
and work through it.

07:28.866 --> 07:29.950
Piece together.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.077
Like the
pieces you play
in an orchestra.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.705
We piece the
memories together...

07:34.830 --> 07:36.832
Piece by piece.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.170
I had no control over that.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.381
Which is a shame,
because that was
a beautiful flying hook.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.845
Are we really
gonna go ahead
with these concerts

07:49.970 --> 07:51.889
just to unlock
the Maestro's memories?

07:52.014 --> 07:54.641
I'm worried you're gonna
be mad if I kill Steve, Stan.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.351
You might even kick me
out of the house.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.604
No way, bud. Did I kick
you out of the house

07:58.729 --> 08:00.856
when you scratched up
my old Jerky Boys CD?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.774
- Yes.
- And I'd do it again.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.922
It was at a concert hall.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.965
We may need to up security.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.736
Shadowy figure.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.383
Dad!

09:11.677 --> 09:14.304
I think the shadowy figure
is the Maestro's dad,

09:14.429 --> 09:15.681
but I can't tell.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.225
I wonder if Maestro's father
is a famous composer,

09:18.350 --> 09:19.351
like John Williams.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.228
Yes. Or maybe Hans Zimmer.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.063
Or he could be Hans Zimmer.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.274
Yeah, that's a famous one too.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.650
I just said Hans Zimmer.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.360
I don't care anymore.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.905
The Maestro's dad
is just going to be Roger
in a little hat anyway.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.157


09:34.283 --> 09:36.618
This is our last
performance of the tour.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.788
Our last chance to see
who the shadowy figure is.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.855
Ah! Dad! Help!

10:10.527 --> 10:12.696
Hey, I almost saw
the Maestro's dad.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.865
Roger, look at Steve.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.617
- This is too dangerous.
We should stop.
- That's a good idea.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.369
I knew you'd abandon me.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.496
Just go and leave me
here to die.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.752
They'll wake up eventually.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.129
No, he's right, Dad.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.007
We have to finish
what we started.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.139
<i>I remember everything.</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:41.516
His name was Papa Heinrich

10:41.641 --> 10:43.226
and he raised Maestro.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.353
He lives in Berlin.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.562
He loved the symphony

10:45.687 --> 10:47.397
and I burned down
the concert hall.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.565
I have to see him.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.025
I have to apologize.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.904
We're going to Berlin!

10:59.868 --> 11:01.995
Guys, I don't mind
if you have a party,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.747
but you got to keep it down.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.546
All right. Have your party.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.132
But be careful with
Mr. Klaus' speaker.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.134
He never goes
anywhere without it.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.012
My JB Flip!

11:19.137 --> 11:21.640
We have to turn
the plane around!

11:25.602 --> 11:26.978
Papa Heinrich.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.438
You got really old.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.023
Oh, you're a custodian.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.108
I am.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.818
Is it really you, Gunter?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.486
Yes, Papa Heinrich.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.447
I'm sorry I burned down
the symphony hall
and then ran away.

11:37.572 --> 11:38.990
It was your favorite place.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.534
Can you ever forgive me?

11:40.659 --> 11:43.203
Oh, Gunter,
it was an accident.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.414
Of course I forgive you.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.290
He forgives me!

11:49.543 --> 11:51.086
- Jenny.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.796
Let's go to
Dieter's Brew Haus.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.506
I remember where
we used to eat.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.383
Oh, it's all flooding back.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.176
Let me just grab
my big trash can.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.472
I will pick zat up!

12:02.597 --> 12:04.641
He's really proud
of his work, huh?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.227
<i>♪ Trash, trash, I love trash ♪</i>

12:07.352 --> 12:09.521
<i>♪ Pick it up, throw it away ♪</i>

12:09.646 --> 12:12.357
<i>♪ I'm a garbage man
With a garbage can ♪</i>

12:13.942 --> 12:15.318
What a garbage band.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.323
Oh, no, that means I like it.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.750
You said that squirrel was
just here for the weekend.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.336
But I see his
stockpile of nuts.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.965
It's obvious you've
got an unauthorized
sublet situation--

12:37.090 --> 12:39.301
Oh, my God. He just
hopped away from me.

12:39.426 --> 12:44.097
Jeff, does your birdhouse
have a freezer big enough
to hold a moose?

12:46.725 --> 12:48.935
And you just
forgot everything?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.271
Yes, I pushed it away
deep into my mind

12:51.396 --> 12:52.939
because I was so ashamed.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.026
<i>Und</i> you came back
for the re-opening
of the concert hall.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.529
- Huh? The one I burned down?
- It just reopened this week.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.906
We should go.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.493
It's the perfect coda
to Maestro's entire journey.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.077
Beautifully put, son.

13:06.203 --> 13:10.332
My pride is coming
to a crescendo.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.002
Ze light broke.
It's trash now.
I'll clean it!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.254
What the heck?
That could've
killed Steve.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.464
I'm gonna complain.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.342
Where's the manager?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.427
I'm ze manager.
Can I help you?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.596
I just need an excuse
to get away from my table.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.931
I don't really need a manager.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.474
When you call for a manager,

13:27.599 --> 13:30.393
I cannot leave until you
give me a complaint.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.437
Okay. Well, the manager
is bothering me.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.522
Terribly sorry.

13:33.647 --> 13:34.898
I will speak with me.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.153
Why did you use
your super speed

13:40.278 --> 13:43.031
to loosen that light fixture
so it would fall on Steve?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.449
Papa Heinrich forgave you.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.700
You should be healed.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.369
Hey, can you
keep it down?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.079
I'm trying to piss
this brand-new way

13:49.204 --> 13:50.789
where I stand on
top of the tank,

13:50.914 --> 13:52.207
but pee delicately enough

13:53.625 --> 13:55.377
that the increased speed
of my urine from this height

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
doesn't splash onto the floor.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.589
Man, I've always wanted
to try that. Go for it.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.509
So close.
- Damn it.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.680
- Roger?
- Dad?

14:10.559 --> 14:15.063
So, Papa Heinrich,
do you like strudel?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.273
I like trash.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.316
Stan, Steve, all this time

14:18.441 --> 14:20.569
we thought my persona
had daddy issues.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.779
- But it's actually me.
- What do you mean?

14:22.904 --> 14:25.115
This is my dad, my real dad.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.533
My issues are with him.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.326
So, Papa Heinrich, shove off.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.121
Wow. My dream is realized.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.206
I am become ze trash.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.042
Heya, how you doing?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.962
Name's Fred.
You got a crazy
chin, my friend.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.298
This seedy-looking
man is your dad?

14:41.423 --> 14:43.300
What? Oh, hold on.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.595
He does personas, like me.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.180
Hey, big man,
how much that
suit cost you?

14:49.306 --> 14:53.518
I know a guy that can
get you one for real cheap
and looks expensive.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.769
Want me to make a call?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.354
Stan, you got to
take him up on that.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.607
Roger, we can and will
get the suits later.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.525
But first, we need to
know what's going on.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.777
Well, it all started--
Actually, you know what?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.904
I hate telling a story
without a beer in my hands.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.948
- Dad, would you mind?
- I'd be delighted.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.783
You start the story
and I'll be right back.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.993
This round's on me.

15:11.202 --> 15:11.828
Uh, hey, sport,
what's your
last name again?

15:11.953 --> 15:13.663
Smith. Sport Smith.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.334
He's putting it
on my tab, isn't he?

15:17.459 --> 15:19.669
It all started in the '70s.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.340
<i>Of course, in the '70s,
everybody found
their way to Berlin.</i>

15:23.465 --> 15:25.091
<i>Great food, cool music</i>

15:25.216 --> 15:26.843
<i>and charming
little businesses.</i>

15:29.471 --> 15:31.306
<i>And that's when I saw Dad.</i>

15:32.349 --> 15:33.767
<i>Fred left when I was a kid,</i>

15:33.892 --> 15:35.894
<i>but I recognized
him immediately</i>

15:36.019 --> 15:39.773
<i>from photos my mom
would burn annually
as a cleansing ritual.</i>

15:39.898 --> 15:42.192
<i>He was so awesome.</i>

15:42.317 --> 15:44.319
<i>He was
a lone wolf,
a renegade,</i>

15:44.444 --> 15:46.738
<i>and brimming with
sexual energy.</i>

15:46.863 --> 15:49.824
Hey. You girls want
to kiss an alien?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.160
I'm an alien. Give me a hug.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.832
<i>But I was too scared
to talk to him.</i>

15:57.957 --> 15:59.459
<i>He left when I was a baby.</i>

16:01.336 --> 16:02.379
<i>Probably because
I was a stupid baby
who deserved it.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:04.756
<i>I had to make sure
I was perfect</i>

16:06.091 --> 16:06.675
<i>before I walked
back into his life.</i>

16:08.009 --> 16:08.843
<i>If I could figure out
what he loved,</i>

16:10.095 --> 16:10.929
<i>I could change
myself to be that.</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:16.643
<i>And what he loved
was the symphony.</i>

16:23.817 --> 16:26.861
<i>That's why I became
Gunter Van Sliezebiscuit,</i>

16:26.986 --> 16:29.656
<i>the son of the
concert hall's
custodian.</i>

16:29.781 --> 16:31.574
<i>Being Gunter
gave me full access</i>

16:31.700 --> 16:33.493
<i>to Fred and the symphony.</i>

16:35.662 --> 16:36.663
<i>And I was able to study
all the great conductors
that came through.</i>

16:36.788 --> 16:38.164
<i>And once I was ready</i>

16:39.916 --> 16:40.542
<i>and had bought
that shockingly
expensive white stick,</i>

16:41.751 --> 16:42.502
<i>I presented myself
to my father</i>

16:43.962 --> 16:45.046
<i>as a conductor of the
thing he loved most.</i>

16:45.171 --> 16:46.506
<i>The symphony.</i>

16:46.631 --> 16:48.299
<i>But I blew it.</i>

16:53.263 --> 16:55.348
<i>It wasn't
Papa Heinrich
in that seat.</i>

16:55.473 --> 16:57.559
<i>It was my real dad, Fred.</i>

16:57.684 --> 16:59.060
Daddy, don't look.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.770
<i>I could tell he recognized me.</i>

17:00.895 --> 17:02.731
<i>A son can always recognize</i>

17:02.856 --> 17:05.275
<i>when his father
recognizes his son.</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:06.359
<i>And he left,</i>

17:06.484 --> 17:08.737
<i>disappointed in me again.</i>

17:08.862 --> 17:11.197
Then I repressed
my abject failure

17:11.322 --> 17:13.199
into Maestro's
persona and ran.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.492
To be honest, Roger,

17:14.617 --> 17:16.411
this guy sounds
like a real dirtbag.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.621
And not a cool
dirtbag like you.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.290
Like a... like a guy you'd--

17:20.415 --> 17:23.126
You'd see sitting
on a folding chair
outside a pawn shop.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.920
- Yes. Thank you.
- What? Where are
you getting that?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.797
This is a story
about a bad son,

17:27.922 --> 17:29.716
undeserving of
a father's love,

17:29.841 --> 17:32.886
who must have
done something terrible
to push his daddy away.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.013
- Probably.
- Roger, it's not
your fault.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.848
Wrong again.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.476
Not wrong. Your dad
abandoned you twice
in the story you just told,

17:40.477 --> 17:40.852
and he's trying
to do it again.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.440
Dad, did they
run out of beer or...

17:49.736 --> 17:50.904
Okay, there's a chance he
might be trying to ditch me.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.280
Go get answers, Roger.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.615
You deserve them.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.784
FYI, ma'am,
wherever you're heading,

17:55.909 --> 17:57.744
I'm gonna have to stop
by the liquor store first

17:57.869 --> 17:59.120
to pick me up another Mad Dog.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.789
The meter will
continue running.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.292
No problem. Hey, quick Q.
Why are you abandoning me?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.544
Roger. There you are.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.004
You see, what happened was--

18:08.129 --> 18:09.339
- Crash.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.637
Roses? For someone
you need to apologize to?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.139
- For abandoning?
- Oh, yeah, good idea.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.641
Ah!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.603
You may now kiss the--

18:23.728 --> 18:25.730
Wait a second. You ain't a--

18:25.855 --> 18:27.899
Oh, the bride's a real broad.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.527
What are you doing
after this wedding, sweetheart?

18:30.652 --> 18:33.613
Ugh. Forgive him, Father.
He knows not what he does.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.739
Or does he?

18:37.158 --> 18:40.411
Look. We're twins,
and twins tell each
other everything.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.873
Okay. Okay.
I can't keep running.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.333
Your personas are tireless.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.085
They're kind of
my favorite thing.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.003
Speaking of,
look where we are.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.423
Welcome to ze
Berlin concert hall.

18:52.549 --> 18:56.594
Let the good times
and the fruit rinds roll!

19:11.317 --> 19:13.611
That's right, you ingrates.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.697
Winter's come early.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.993
This is my favorite
part of butchering.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.579
Making snow out of the bones.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.581
All right, let's
just get to it.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.376
You left when
I was a little kid,
only 400 years old,

19:28.501 --> 19:29.752
so what did I do wrong?

19:29.878 --> 19:31.921
Uh, I just wanted
to be on my own.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.631
It had nothing to do with you.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.051
My whole life had
nothing to do with you.
That's kind of the point.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.095
But come on.
You're here
on Earth,

19:39.220 --> 19:41.514
in Berlin, the only town
you've seen me in

19:41.639 --> 19:43.182
in the last 1,000 years.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.143
You have to be here
for me a little bit.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.854
Oh, I'm just popping in
for the reopening
of the symphony.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.856
And to stock up
on my eczema cream.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.442
Honestly,
I forgot you were
on this planet.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.402
Stan and Steve were right.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.988
You're a dirtbag.
I don't need you.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.283
Yeah, you don't
need me or anyone.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.534
Needing people

20:02.785 --> 20:03.286
means other people
have control of your life.

20:04.287 --> 20:04.913
Or it means
you're lucky enough

20:05.997 --> 20:06.998
to have people
in your life who care.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.124
Oh...

20:09.250 --> 20:10.043
That family you're
playing house with?

20:11.502 --> 20:13.046
Please. They'll drop you
the second you get difficult.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.380
I'm always difficult.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.507
I tried to murder
Steve dozens of times

20:16.633 --> 20:18.176
in the last three days alone.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.261
Roger, are you in here?

20:20.386 --> 20:22.639
Yes. I'm over here with my--

20:22.764 --> 20:24.223
With my no one.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.225
Sorry, Roger.
He's missing out.

20:26.351 --> 20:30.647
I guess I just wanted
a father-son bond
like you two have.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.358
We can't all have an
incredible bond like, um--

20:33.483 --> 20:36.027
Like Papa Heinrich
and an old milk carton?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.528
Oh, no. The magic's gone.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.780
What the hell?

20:40.031 --> 20:40.865
Well, I'm disappointed
you're not playing rugby.

20:40.990 --> 20:41.991
I knew it!

20:42.116 --> 20:44.160
Oh, my son,
the great detective.

20:45.453 --> 20:49.290
<i>♪ And that's an episode
Set in Germany ♪</i>

20:49.415 --> 20:52.293
