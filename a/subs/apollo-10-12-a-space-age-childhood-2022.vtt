00:08.666 --> 00:11.208
<i>Six, five, four,</i>

00:11.291 --> 00:15.125
<i>three, two, one, zero.</i>

00:15.208 --> 00:16.666
<i>All engine running.</i>

00:17.166 --> 00:18.250
<i>Liftoff.</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:46.166
<i>The time is spring 1969.</i>

00:46.250 --> 00:50.166
<i>The place is Ed White Elementary School</i>
<i>in El Lago, Texas,</i>

00:50.250 --> 00:53.208
<i>a South Houston suburb</i>
<i>right down the road from NASA.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:57.000
<i>The occasion on this fateful day</i>
<i>that put everything in motion?</i>

00:57.500 --> 00:59.083
<i>Fourth grade recess.</i>

00:59.666 --> 01:00.791
<i>No, that's not me.</i>

01:00.875 --> 01:04.416
<i>That's Ricky Rodriguez,</i>
<i>one of my many ne'er-do-well buddies.</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:05.916
<i>They had changed the rules,</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:08.333
<i>so you weren't supposed</i>
<i>to throw the ball at people,</i>

01:08.416 --> 01:11.083
<i>which was kind of the most fun thing</i>
<i>about kickball.</i>

01:11.166 --> 01:13.208
<i>It was taking some gettin' used to.</i>

01:13.791 --> 01:18.291
<i>And that's Mr. St. George, our PE coach,</i>
<i>walking Ricky over to the wall.</i>

01:19.541 --> 01:22.041
<i>He was a very specific disciplinarian,</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:24.750
<i>drawing you a little circle</i>
<i>on the nearest wall.</i>

01:25.250 --> 01:27.541
Here. Put your nose in there
and keep it in there.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.833
<i>And it was always just a little higher</i>
<i>than was comfortable,</i>

01:30.916 --> 01:34.458
<i>so you'd be up on your tippy-toes</i>
<i>until the end of the class.</i>

01:37.250 --> 01:41.041
<i>The one time he was sticking my nose</i>
<i>to the wall, I was ready for him.</i>

01:41.541 --> 01:44.958
<i>The key, I figured,</i>
<i>was to imperceptibly spread your stance</i>

01:45.041 --> 01:49.375
<i>and slump ever so slightly lower</i>
<i>at the crucial moment of his calculation.</i>

01:50.666 --> 01:51.625
Put your nose there.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.333
<i>So that's me. Stanley.</i>

01:54.833 --> 01:58.291
<i>Everyone just called me Stan,</i>
<i>unless I was in trouble, of course,</i>

01:58.375 --> 02:00.958
<i>or on the first day of class</i>
<i>when they read roll.</i>

02:01.958 --> 02:04.875
<i>In kickball, I was kind of a shortstop</i>
<i>and general field rover,</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:08.250
<i>instructed by teammates</i>
<i>to try and catch everything I could.</i>

02:08.333 --> 02:11.666
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>I was a pretty impressive kicker as well.</i>

02:11.750 --> 02:13.583
<i>But back to how it all got started.</i>

02:13.666 --> 02:17.500
<i>It was those guys</i>
<i>that changed my life forever.</i>

02:17.583 --> 02:18.833
There's our kid.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
We scouted you on the kickball field,
we spoke with your teachers.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.041
We're impressed with…

02:39.416 --> 02:42.458
a few of your science reports,
and we like that you've earned

02:42.541 --> 02:45.791
a Presidential Physical Fitness Award
three years running.

02:45.875 --> 02:48.958
We've selected you
as the perfect candidate for this mission.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.000
Mission? For what?

02:51.500 --> 02:54.416
Listen, time's a factor here,
so we're gonna be very blunt.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.250
We accidentally built the lunar module

02:58.166 --> 02:59.291
a little too small.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.791
But we're not gonna let that set us back.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.500
How'd that happen?

03:03.583 --> 03:04.583
Are you good at math?

03:05.166 --> 03:07.875
-Yeah.
-Do you get a perfect 100 on every test?

03:08.541 --> 03:09.833
-No.
-Okay.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.583
We are this close,
but we need to test this…

03:15.333 --> 03:19.583
…accidentally smaller version
on the lunar surface, and soon.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.458
And we need a kid like you to help us out,

03:22.541 --> 03:24.708
so we can beat those damn Russians
to the moon.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.708
Why don't you just send a chimpanzee?

03:26.791 --> 03:30.750
Because you speak
more actual words of the English language.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.458
Stan, you're our only hope.

03:33.541 --> 03:36.291
Come on. What do you say?
Do it for your country.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.541
Do it for the free world!

03:41.583 --> 03:42.500
Okay.

03:43.708 --> 03:46.791
Great. Secret training starts
end of school year.

03:47.458 --> 03:48.625
Secret?

03:48.708 --> 03:51.083
Top secret, Stan.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.625
This is a covert operation.
It does not exist. Get it?

03:54.458 --> 03:56.791
This meeting? This never happened.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.541
No one can know about this.

03:58.625 --> 04:01.458
Not your parents.
Not your brothers. Not your sisters.

04:01.958 --> 04:03.916
-No one.
-Wait.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.458
How will we get away with this?

04:06.541 --> 04:08.375
Where will everyone think I am?

04:08.458 --> 04:11.166
Summer camp.
You were recommended, accepted,

04:11.250 --> 04:14.416
and received a scholarship
to Camp Grizzly,

04:14.500 --> 04:17.625
a special outdoor camp
just outside of Lake Traverse, Michigan.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.541
You went up in late May
and stayed through almost all of June.

04:22.875 --> 04:27.708
I'm not gonna lie, the weather and bugs
were arduous, but you had a great time.

04:27.791 --> 04:29.000
Hmm.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.875
-A great time indeed.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.125
Some things you never forget, Stan.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.125
<i>Okay, pause!</i>

05:16.208 --> 05:19.916
<i>Let's forget about all this for now.</i>
<i>We'll come back to this part later.</i>

05:20.000 --> 05:22.708
<i>First, let me tell you about</i>
<i>life back then.</i>

05:22.791 --> 05:25.083
<i>It was a great time and place to be a kid.</i>

05:25.166 --> 05:27.750
<i>Living in the Houston area</i>
<i>in the late '60s,</i>

05:27.833 --> 05:29.583
<i>and especially near NASA,</i>

05:29.666 --> 05:32.333
<i>was like being</i>
<i>where science fiction was coming to life.</i>

05:32.416 --> 05:35.875
<i>The optimistic technological future</i>
<i>was now,</i>

05:35.958 --> 05:39.250
<i>and we were at the absolute center</i>
<i>of everything new and better.</i>

05:39.750 --> 05:42.583
<i>Leading the way was,</i>
<i>of course, the space program.</i>

05:44.333 --> 05:46.291
<i>The goal of going to the moon</i>
<i>had been declared</i>

05:46.375 --> 05:50.375
<i>when President Kennedy gave his speech</i>
<i>at Rice University in Houston.</i>

05:50.458 --> 05:52.541
But why, some say, the moon?

05:53.166 --> 05:55.291
Why choose this as our goal?

05:56.083 --> 05:57.583
And they may well ask,

05:58.083 --> 06:00.041
"Why climb the highest mountain?"

06:00.625 --> 06:04.041
"Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?"

06:04.541 --> 06:06.625
"Why does Rice play Texas?"

06:06.708 --> 06:08.625
We choose to go to the moon.

06:10.916 --> 06:15.500
We choose to go to the moon in this decade
and do the other things,

06:15.583 --> 06:19.041
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

06:20.375 --> 06:24.083
<i>The Space Center was relocated</i>
<i>to the outskirts of town in 1962.</i>

06:25.458 --> 06:27.541
<i>That same year, Houston started to build</i>

06:27.625 --> 06:29.750
<i>the world's first dome stadium.</i>

06:29.833 --> 06:31.958
<i>The eighth wonder of the world.</i>

06:32.041 --> 06:33.375
<i>The Astrodome.</i>

06:34.458 --> 06:36.000
<i>When they did the groundbreaking,</i>

06:36.083 --> 06:38.708
<i>instead of ceremonial digs</i>
<i>in the earth with shovels,</i>

06:38.791 --> 06:42.458
<i>all the officials shot Colt .45 pistols</i>
<i>into the ground instead.</i>

06:43.583 --> 06:45.916
<i>And the dome</i>
<i>had the first animated scoreboard</i>

06:46.000 --> 06:48.500
<i>with all kinds of fun, lit-up graphics.</i>

06:48.583 --> 06:50.958
<i>But the best</i>
<i>was when an Astro hit a home run,</i>

06:51.041 --> 06:54.666
<i>or, as they like to say,</i>
<i>put the ball into Astro orbit,</i>

06:54.750 --> 06:58.291
<i>which set off this huge,</i>
<i>electronic fireworks display.</i>

07:01.625 --> 07:04.541
<i>And this was the place</i>
<i>that first had Astroturf.</i>

07:05.041 --> 07:08.416
<i>The artificial surface would need</i>
<i>no watering, mowing, or weeding,</i>

07:08.500 --> 07:10.375
<i>and be the perfect expression of this era</i>

07:10.458 --> 07:13.208
<i>when everything was new</i>
<i>and man-made and therefore better.</i>

07:13.291 --> 07:16.000
<i>Even though Joe Namath said</i>
<i>it was like playing on concrete,</i>

07:16.083 --> 07:18.500
<i>it felt like nature</i>
<i>and all her earthly restrictions</i>

07:18.583 --> 07:19.625
<i>were being conquered.</i>

07:19.708 --> 07:21.958
<i>And no one doubted that, in our lifetimes,</i>

07:22.041 --> 07:25.000
<i>we'd have the option to live on the moon,</i>
<i>or maybe a nearby planet,</i>

07:25.083 --> 07:27.750
<i>probably in some kinda domed space colony.</i>

07:27.833 --> 07:30.375
<i>And, given the rate</i>
<i>of all this technological innovation,</i>

07:30.458 --> 07:31.958
<i>it was easy to imagine</i>

07:32.041 --> 07:35.250
<i>that we'd all probably be livin'</i>
<i>well past the age of a hundred.</i>

07:35.333 --> 07:37.333
<i>For example,</i>
<i>just over at the medical center,</i>

07:37.916 --> 07:41.041
<i>DeBakey and Cooley</i>
<i>were perfecting the heart transplant.</i>

07:41.125 --> 07:42.583
<i>And even closer to home,</i>

07:42.666 --> 07:47.125
<i>we were one of the first regions</i>
<i>in the country to get push-button phones.</i>

07:47.208 --> 07:48.458
Y'all, listen to this.

07:48.541 --> 07:51.166
<i>It was the coolest. No more dialing.</i>

07:51.250 --> 07:53.375
<i>-And you could play songs with the tones.</i>

07:53.458 --> 07:56.041
<i>My sister Vicky</i>
<i>was the musical one in the family.</i>

07:56.125 --> 07:58.583
<i>She was the oldest, followed by Steve,</i>

07:59.166 --> 08:02.583
<i>then Jana, Greg, Stephanie, and then me.</i>

08:03.625 --> 08:04.625
Okay. Show your moves.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.125
Okay, good.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.500
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

08:23.333 --> 08:24.916
<i>Sure, our country was at war.</i>

08:25.416 --> 08:26.750
<i>Cities were on fire,</i>

08:26.833 --> 08:28.833
<i>and all hell was breaking loose</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

08:31.291 --> 08:34.000
<i>But from a kid's perspective,</i>
<i>out in the suburbs,</i>

08:34.083 --> 08:36.083
<i>it was all confined to the television.</i>

08:36.583 --> 08:39.250
<i>And as a kid,</i>
<i>you just figure it's all normal.</i>

08:39.833 --> 08:41.041
<i>Another riot.</i>

08:41.541 --> 08:43.083
<i>Another famous leader assassinated.</i>

08:43.791 --> 08:45.708
<i>I guess that's just how adults act.</i>

08:46.208 --> 08:48.541
<i>In our family, it seemed</i>
<i>that only Vicky embodied</i>

08:48.625 --> 08:50.666
<i>the so-called generation gap of the time.</i>

08:50.750 --> 08:53.916
<i>She was the only one of us who seemed</i>
<i>o know or care very much</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:55.625
<i>about what was going on in the world.</i>

08:56.416 --> 08:59.875
<i>The closest we ever got to the action</i>
<i>was when we were in Houston with Mom</i>

08:59.958 --> 09:03.875
<i>near the college where it seemed she was</i>
<i>forever in grad school during this time.</i>

09:07.750 --> 09:09.625
-Look at how they're dressed.
-Those?

09:09.708 --> 09:12.333
See, kids,
this is why we moved to the suburbs.

09:12.416 --> 09:14.791
To get away from these kinds of people.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.541
The squares are scared.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.916
No. Your sister is full of crap.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.666
-We moved here because of your dad's job.
-Mm-hmm.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.875
He was sick of commuting an hour each way.
Got it?

09:25.958 --> 09:27.500
-Okay. Okay, Mom.
-Got it.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.916
Got it. Um, Mom, is that one a hippie?

09:32.750 --> 09:34.750
Yeah. Yeah, that's a hippie.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.125
How about that one?

09:37.333 --> 09:39.000
No. His hair's not long enough.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.500
But he's wearing bell-bottoms.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.583
Oh.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.375
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's a hippie.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.000
I think I like hippies.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.541
<i>And in those new suburbs</i>
<i>expanding south of Houston,</i>

09:55.625 --> 09:58.333
<i>housing divisions were springin' up</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

09:59.000 --> 10:01.333
<i>Our neighborhood</i>
<i>was full of houses under construction.</i>

10:02.000 --> 10:03.750
<i>The land was totally flat.</i>

10:03.833 --> 10:07.875
<i>The only thing remotely resembling a hill</i>
<i>was the overpass out on the interstate.</i>

10:07.958 --> 10:12.708
<i>We're talking coastal plains,</i>
<i>a mere 30 or so feet above sea level.</i>

10:12.791 --> 10:14.833
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>they hadn't put in enough drainage,</i>

10:14.916 --> 10:17.916
<i>so every time it rained for</i>
<i>any length of time, everything flooded.</i>

10:18.416 --> 10:20.458
-Look! It's a water moccasin!

10:20.541 --> 10:22.583
Every time!

10:23.541 --> 10:25.625
<i>There was no sense of history here,</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:28.541
<i>for everything as far as you could see</i>
<i>was brand new.</i>

10:28.625 --> 10:30.375
<i>New and endless shopping centers</i>

10:30.458 --> 10:33.083
<i>with grocery stores, burger restaurants,</i>

10:33.166 --> 10:34.708
<i>and, best of all,</i>

10:34.791 --> 10:36.791
<i>a bowling alley and arcade.</i>

10:37.375 --> 10:40.416
<i>At least once a week, we'd walk</i>
<i>or ride bikes over to the bowling alley.</i>

10:41.875 --> 10:44.625
<i>We'd bowl when our parents were paying,</i>
<i>but on our own,</i>

10:44.708 --> 10:46.916
<i>the arcade was where the action was.</i>

10:47.500 --> 10:51.500
<i>We developed a self-sustaining system</i>
<i>that extended our meager allowance.</i>

10:52.000 --> 10:55.708
<i>For an investment of a quarter each,</i>
<i>we could get an RC Cola for 15 cents</i>

10:55.791 --> 10:57.666
<i>and a pinball game for a dime.</i>

11:00.916 --> 11:03.833
<i>We'd concentrate on the games</i>
<i>we'd mastered, like Aquarius.</i>

11:04.375 --> 11:07.125
<i>All the pressure would,</i>
<i>of course, be on the first game.</i>

11:07.625 --> 11:10.166
<i>Immediately winning,</i>
<i>not only to keep playing,</i>

11:10.250 --> 11:13.166
<i>but to eventually</i>
<i>fill up the machine with free games.</i>

11:13.791 --> 11:16.041
<i>Then when it was time to go home,</i>

11:16.125 --> 11:19.125
<i>we could usually sell them off</i>
<i>for 50 cents to some older person</i>

11:19.208 --> 11:20.750
<i>who thought that was a good deal.</i>

11:28.166 --> 11:30.291
<i>Maybe part of the allure</i>
<i>of the bowling alley</i>

11:30.375 --> 11:32.416
<i>was it was</i>
<i>where the local hoodlums hung out.</i>

11:33.083 --> 11:34.666
<i>We would marvel at their swagger</i>

11:34.750 --> 11:37.000
<i>and the methods they used</i>
<i>to beat the system,</i>

11:37.083 --> 11:40.125
<i>whether crudely lessening</i>
<i>the gravitational pull of the machine</i>

11:40.208 --> 11:43.041
<i>or deftly getting a game</i>
<i>without putting in any money.</i>

11:43.541 --> 11:48.250
<i>When done just right, the machine would</i>
<i>apparently start a new game.</i>

11:48.750 --> 11:50.250
<i>It was masterful.</i>

11:51.041 --> 11:53.375
<i>I tried that maneuver</i>
<i>for the next several years</i>

11:53.458 --> 11:54.750
<i>but never figured it out.</i>

11:58.500 --> 12:01.375
<i>We'd been one of the first houses</i>
<i>completed on our street,</i>

12:01.875 --> 12:05.541
<i>and it felt like the entire neighborhood</i>
<i>was a construction site and up for grabs.</i>

12:06.500 --> 12:09.250
<i>You could build a whole fort</i>
<i>out of the throwaway wood piles.</i>

12:10.291 --> 12:11.458
<i>That would have to suffice,</i>

12:11.541 --> 12:14.791
<i>because tree houses</i>
<i>were probably a couple decades away.</i>

12:15.750 --> 12:17.833
Dad, isn't this stealing?

12:17.916 --> 12:19.875
Well, the way I figure it,

12:19.958 --> 12:22.125
they charged us way too much
for the house,

12:22.208 --> 12:24.416
so technically, they owe us.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.875
It's just a piece of plywood.
They'll never miss it.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.041
<i>I'm still not sure</i>
<i>if my dad was in the frugal,</i>

12:30.125 --> 12:33.125
<i>struggling-to-make-ends-meet category</i>

12:33.208 --> 12:34.833
<i>or closer to a scam artist.</i>

12:34.916 --> 12:37.125
Pull it back. Tighten the net. There.

12:37.208 --> 12:41.333
<i>But it was clear our family's sole mission</i>
<i>was to save as much money as possible.</i>

12:41.833 --> 12:42.875
Nice.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:49.791 --> 12:53.083
You're not finished.
Put the nozzle back in my gas tank.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.416
Now squeeze the handle completely open.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.250
Now lift the hose from back to front.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.750
That's my gas in the hose.

13:05.833 --> 13:06.958
-I paid for it.
-Dad…

13:07.041 --> 13:07.875
He knows that.

13:08.791 --> 13:12.125
<i>Even though my dad was in charge</i>
<i>of shipping and receiving at NASA…</i>

13:12.208 --> 13:14.291
You go beat those Russkies.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.958
Roger that, comrade.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.916
<i>…and apparently made a good enough living</i>

13:18.000 --> 13:20.250
<i>to more or less raise a family</i>
<i>with six kids,</i>

13:20.750 --> 13:23.083
<i>I was embarrassed</i>
<i>he was more of a paper pusher</i>

13:23.166 --> 13:25.583
<i>than someone who had</i>
<i>anything to do with the missions.</i>

13:25.666 --> 13:28.291
There is and there isn't
a possibility of advancement…

13:28.375 --> 13:31.333
<i>He felt as far away from being</i>
<i>an astronaut as you could get.</i>

13:31.416 --> 13:33.208
My dad targets the coordinates

13:33.291 --> 13:36.708
so that when the astronauts
splashdown in the ocean,

13:37.208 --> 13:39.375
the navy can come pick them up.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.833
He's the guy that when the countdown
finally gets to blast off,

13:42.916 --> 13:47.250
my dad's the one actually
pushing a button launching everything.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.000
When I was walking home from school…

13:49.083 --> 13:51.125
<i>I guess I was</i>
<i>what you'd call a fabulist,</i>

13:51.208 --> 13:53.958
<i>which is just a nicer way of saying</i>
<i>"persistent liar."</i>

13:54.041 --> 13:55.666
So I got a little closer.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.166
That's when I realized

13:57.250 --> 13:59.375
there were wires attached to him,

13:59.458 --> 14:01.750
stretching up to, like, outer space.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.000
He was some kind of robot.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.375
I was hoping I could bring him here today,

14:07.458 --> 14:10.583
but suddenly,
he just got pulled up by the wires.

14:13.416 --> 14:16.208
Mrs. Ulrich said you didn't bring
anything to show and tell.

14:16.291 --> 14:20.166
You know, I just did the "tell" part,
hoping they'd imagine the "show" part.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.250
She says you told the entire class

14:22.333 --> 14:26.000
that your father's scheduled to go
on Apollo 14 or 15 in 1972.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.041
Honey. Honey, is that true?

14:28.708 --> 14:31.708
Why can't Dad do something important
at NASA?

14:31.791 --> 14:34.458
-It's a little bit embarrassing.
-Stan.

14:35.291 --> 14:39.500
Your father has worked very hard
to make it to the top of his department.

14:39.583 --> 14:42.041
He's in charge of everything
that goes into that place,

14:42.125 --> 14:43.625
from a pen to a space suit.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.541
He is important. Okay?

14:45.625 --> 14:46.458
Okay.

14:47.083 --> 14:51.291
I was just wondering why he couldn't be
an astronaut or something actually cool.

14:51.375 --> 14:55.250
Honey,
not everyone gets to be an astronaut.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.583
Everyone does their part,
and it takes a lot of people.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.458
Including your father. Got it?

15:00.541 --> 15:02.083
-Got it.
-Good.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.708
<i>It was true.</i> <i>A neighbor behind us</i>
<i>worked on the helmets.</i>

15:05.791 --> 15:08.041
<i>Several friends' dads</i>
<i>were engineers at NASA.</i>

15:08.125 --> 15:10.666
<i>A girl in my class's mom</i>
<i>helped make the suits.</i>

15:10.750 --> 15:13.708
<i>It was like everyone was doin'</i>
<i>somethin' for NASA one way or another.</i>

15:13.791 --> 15:17.583
<i>My dad was doin' his part, too,</i>
<i>however meager in my eyes.</i>

15:18.750 --> 15:21.083
<i>Like I said, I was the last of six</i>

15:21.166 --> 15:23.333
<i>in our own</i>
Brady Bunch<i> configuration of a family,</i>

15:24.000 --> 15:26.250
<i>-and the only one born in the '60s.</i>

15:26.333 --> 15:28.083
<i>By the time I came around,</i>

15:28.166 --> 15:31.666
<i>my parents were largely done with</i>
<i>documenting everything their kids did.</i>

15:31.750 --> 15:33.375
Aw!

15:33.458 --> 15:35.916
<i>I was incorporated into</i>
<i>the existing system,</i>

15:36.000 --> 15:37.166
<i>but that was about it.</i>

15:37.666 --> 15:40.666
<i>I'm hardly in any family photos</i>
<i>or home movies.</i>

15:40.750 --> 15:43.041
<i>My siblings used to mess with me about it.</i>

15:43.541 --> 15:46.250
See?
See how you're not in any of these?

15:46.916 --> 15:49.875
They're afraid to tell you,
but you were adopted.

15:50.541 --> 15:54.000
Mom and Dad are too broken to tell you,
but we got you in an orphanage.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.666
They picked you
out of a crowd of screaming babies.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.083
Har-di-har-har. Very funny.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.041
<i>I learned later that after I was born,</i>

16:00.125 --> 16:02.666
<i>my mom got on this new thing</i>
<i>called the pill</i>

16:02.750 --> 16:05.875
<i>but never told our priest,</i>
<i>for fear of being excommunicated.</i>

16:07.500 --> 16:08.958
-Dad, you're it.
-You're it!

16:09.041 --> 16:10.000
Gotcha!

16:11.083 --> 16:12.583
-Aah!
-Got you. You're it!

16:13.750 --> 16:16.708
<i>Then there were</i>
<i>our next-door neighbors, the Pateks,</i>

16:16.791 --> 16:18.666
<i>who were clearly not using contraception</i>

16:18.750 --> 16:21.458
<i>because they were still kickin' out</i>
<i>a kid about every year.</i>

16:21.958 --> 16:23.625
<i>Their mother was so overworked,</i>

16:23.708 --> 16:27.750
<i>she'd sometimes just give the kids</i>
<i>rubber bands to chew on between meals.</i>

16:28.750 --> 16:30.958
<i>And she was obsessed with cleanliness.</i>

16:31.541 --> 16:33.541
<i>She kept their house spick and span,</i>

16:33.625 --> 16:37.000
<i>and to aid in this, she'd put</i>
<i>all her kids outside almost all day long.</i>

16:37.083 --> 16:38.833
<i>Except the newborn, of course.</i>

16:38.916 --> 16:40.000
No!

16:40.083 --> 16:42.916
<i>She'd put the next-to-youngest outside</i>
<i>in the care of the older kids</i>

16:43.000 --> 16:45.708
<i>while she stayed inside</i>
<i>with the youngest and cleaned.</i>

16:47.166 --> 16:49.791
<i>Every now and then,</i>
<i>somethin' like this would happen.</i>

16:52.291 --> 16:53.291
<i>But we all seemed</i>

16:53.375 --> 16:55.583
<i>-to somehow survive our childhoods.</i>
-Stop, stop!

16:55.666 --> 16:56.666
Wait, wait, wait!

16:59.166 --> 17:00.875
<i>After the Pateks' dad got off work,</i>

17:00.958 --> 17:05.000
<i>he'd usually just sit in the open garage</i>
<i>most of the evenin' smokin' cigars.</i>

17:05.625 --> 17:08.833
<i>I guess he was also doin' his part</i>
<i>in keepin' the house clean.</i>

17:11.958 --> 17:14.375
<i>The six of us</i>
<i>formed quite an army of workers,</i>

17:15.291 --> 17:18.958
<i>keepin' the house and yard clean</i>
<i>and executing our systems with precision.</i>

17:20.708 --> 17:22.541
<i>In addition to endless outdoor work,</i>

17:22.625 --> 17:25.750
<i>my biggest indoor job</i>
<i>was to empty all the trash cans.</i>

17:26.250 --> 17:28.625
<i>I'm not even sure</i>
<i>if they had plastic trash bags yet,</i>

17:28.708 --> 17:32.375
<i>but it wouldn't have mattered,</i>
<i>because we only used old grocery bags</i>

17:32.458 --> 17:33.750
<i>which were prone to leaking,</i>

17:33.833 --> 17:36.625
<i>depending on whatever liquid-y crap</i>
<i>everyone threw away.</i>

17:37.125 --> 17:40.208
<i>And, of course, it was my job</i>
<i>to clean up the floor after.</i>

17:41.041 --> 17:44.708
<i>Maybe because we couldn't afford it,</i>
<i>we hardly ever went out to a restaurant.</i>

17:44.791 --> 17:49.291
<i>Mom was a genius at conjuring up meals</i>
<i>and carryin' 'em out for days.</i>

17:49.375 --> 17:52.875
<i>The canned ham would have brown sugar</i>
<i>and pineapple on it Sunday.</i>

17:52.958 --> 17:54.708
<i>Monday, there'd be ham casserole.</i>

17:54.791 --> 17:56.250
<i>Tuesday, ham sandwiches,</i>

17:56.333 --> 17:59.500
<i>and Wednesday's navy bean soup</i>
<i>would have the rest of the ham in it.</i>

18:00.000 --> 18:03.291
<i>Other staples included</i>
<i>tomato soup and grilled cheese,</i>

18:03.375 --> 18:05.541
<i>tuna casserole with potato chips,</i>

18:06.166 --> 18:08.000
<i>pot pies, meatloaf,</i>

18:08.583 --> 18:12.875
<i>endless variations of chicken,</i>
<i>and, of course, a lot of creamed corn.</i>

18:12.958 --> 18:15.166
<i>The fun stuff was deviled eggs,</i>

18:15.250 --> 18:17.708
<i>homemade Popsicles, Vienna sausages,</i>

18:17.791 --> 18:21.041
<i>-and on special occasions, Jiffy Pop.</i>

18:22.000 --> 18:24.875
<i>It was also the first wave</i>
<i>of the Jello mold craze.</i>

18:26.166 --> 18:27.375
Aah!

18:28.583 --> 18:30.833
<i>School lunches were their own production.</i>

18:30.916 --> 18:33.000
<i>Every Sunday night,</i>
<i>we'd all be Mom's helpers</i>

18:33.083 --> 18:37.333
<i>as we'd systematically make a week's worth</i>
<i>of sandwiches for school lunches,</i>

18:37.416 --> 18:40.083
<i>and then freeze 'em</i>
<i>to be thawed out overnight</i>

18:40.166 --> 18:42.083
<i>before each day of the school week.</i>

18:48.208 --> 18:50.333
<i>Sometimes the thawing wasn't complete,</i>

18:50.833 --> 18:55.041
<i>and you'd end up with a half-frozen,</i>
<i>soggy white bread bologna sandwich.</i>

19:01.416 --> 19:03.958
<i>My dad's parents lived in</i>
<i>an old neighborhood in Houston,</i>

19:04.041 --> 19:06.583
<i>-and we'd go visit on weekends.</i>

19:07.083 --> 19:09.333
You just keep tappin' it lightly…

19:13.958 --> 19:15.333
until it straightens out.

19:15.833 --> 19:16.666
See there?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.791
A nail will last forever,
so you don't ever want to throw 'em away.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.000
Just make sure
you got a good place to store 'em.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.500
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-My grandparents' reaction</i>

19:24.583 --> 19:26.083
<i>to havin' lived through the Depression</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:28.583
<i>was to feel it was goin' to happen again</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

19:28.666 --> 19:29.708
Don't hit your fingers.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.958
<i>They saved everything</i>
<i>that had the slightest value</i>

19:35.041 --> 19:38.041
<i>-and reused everything they could.</i>
-See? I think you got it.

19:39.750 --> 19:43.416
<i>They even reused paper towels,</i>
<i>which begged the question,</i>

19:43.500 --> 19:47.333
<i>what the hell's the point of a paper towel</i>
<i>as opposed to, like, a rag?</i>

19:47.416 --> 19:50.041
<i>But none of us</i>
<i>ever said anything.</i>

19:50.541 --> 19:51.666
We're not going to…

19:51.750 --> 19:54.708
<i>And I swear my grandmother took us</i>
<i>to see </i>The Sound Of Music

19:54.791 --> 19:56.208
<i>about every six months.</i>

20:03.166 --> 20:06.000
<i>I'm not sure if the movie</i>
<i>was playing for years and years</i>

20:06.083 --> 20:07.916
<i>-or if they kept bringin' it back.</i>

20:08.000 --> 20:10.916
<i>-It was just another outing with Grandma…</i>

20:11.000 --> 20:14.083
-<i>…who, like her movie choices,</i>

20:14.166 --> 20:16.708
<i>was a very sweet lady</i>
<i>you couldn't find much fault in.</i>

20:18.791 --> 20:22.500
<i>My other grandmother</i>
<i>was much more edgy and paranoid,</i>

20:22.583 --> 20:24.041
<i>but very entertaining.</i>

20:24.750 --> 20:26.833
<i>She would stay with us for long stretches</i>

20:26.916 --> 20:29.541
<i>and regale us</i>
<i>with various conspiracy theories</i>

20:29.625 --> 20:31.458
<i>and doom and gloom scenarios.</i>

20:31.541 --> 20:36.250
We now know
JFK didn't die that day in Dallas.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.375
Mm-mm.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.958
Poor man was rendered a vegetable

20:40.041 --> 20:42.666
due to the severe brain trauma
from the bullets.

20:43.166 --> 20:49.125
But they are keepin' him alive
in seclusion on a Greek island.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.375
They didn't think we could handle
seeing the president as a vegetable,

20:53.458 --> 20:56.875
so they are shieldin' us
from the true facts.

20:57.583 --> 20:59.875
It's Aristotle Onassis's
island.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.708
Which explains his marriage to Jackie.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.958
<i>To her,</i>
<i>the world was goin' down the tubes,</i>

21:08.041 --> 21:09.375
<i>and fast.</i>

21:11.041 --> 21:14.416
Overpopulation is chokin' the planet.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.708
And within a few years,

21:16.791 --> 21:19.916
we are gonna be past
the point of no return.

21:20.708 --> 21:24.291
Scientists say
that the Earth cannot technically handle

21:24.375 --> 21:28.875
more than 3.5 billion people,
and at some point in the '70s,

21:28.958 --> 21:33.041
food supply's just gonna collapse
for most of the world's inhabitants,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.833
which leads to mass starvation
and war and famine.

21:37.708 --> 21:39.916
Don't know how they'll keep up
with the dead bodies--

21:40.000 --> 21:43.333
Enough already, Mom.
You gotta stop with the paranoia talk.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.750
You're scarin' the kids.
You're drivin' me nuts.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.625
You won't shut up. Please stop.

21:47.708 --> 21:49.500
Stop. Stop.

21:51.291 --> 21:55.291
<i>It costs over $4.5 billion</i>
<i>every year to cart the mess away…</i>

21:55.375 --> 21:59.583
<i>Yes, with such threats looming,</i>
<i>the future was often terrifying.</i>

21:59.666 --> 22:02.125
<i>We were told</i>
<i>if everything continued as it was going,</i>

22:02.208 --> 22:06.208
<i>we'd be knee-deep in trash</i>
<i>and wearing gas masks just to breathe.</i>

22:06.291 --> 22:09.375
<i>They did a great job</i>
<i>of scarin' the hell out of everyone.</i>

22:09.458 --> 22:10.916
<i>It must've worked.</i>

22:11.000 --> 22:15.291
<i>President Nixon signed the Clean Air Act</i>
<i>and the Clean Water Act,</i>

22:15.375 --> 22:18.000
<i>and it soon became unacceptable to litter.</i>

22:22.791 --> 22:27.291
Now, that, young Steven, is the difference
between a redneck and white trash.

22:27.916 --> 22:31.916
A redneck's gonna throw his cans on the
floor of his car, the back of his truck.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.750
White trash,
he's gonna throw his cans out the window

22:34.833 --> 22:35.833
and be a litterbug.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.250
That's no good.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.166
So we're rednecks?

22:40.250 --> 22:41.625
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

22:42.125 --> 22:45.250
A redneck would just leave the cans
just laying there.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.041
You're gonna clean those up
when we get back to the house.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.541
-Sh!

22:49.625 --> 22:50.541
Oh.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.541
Take the wheel.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.250
-What?
-Drive.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.416
<i>That's right.</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:58.958
<i>It wasn't against the law</i>
<i>to drink and drive back then.</i>

22:59.041 --> 23:01.083
<i>You just couldn't be legally intoxicated.</i>

23:01.166 --> 23:02.208
Make a wish.

23:02.291 --> 23:03.333
Dad, I just--

23:03.416 --> 23:06.041
<i>I remember how he'd drop the tab</i>
<i>into the beer itself.</i>

23:06.708 --> 23:11.708
<i>And I wasn't sure if it was a ritual</i>
<i>or if it was Dad's anti-littering effort.</i>

23:11.791 --> 23:13.583
<i>Either way, it was appreciated,</i>

23:14.166 --> 23:18.041
<i>'cause those tabs are on the ground,</i>
<i>and they could really slice up your feet.</i>

23:18.625 --> 23:20.250
<i>-However, I heard…</i>
-How'd you do?

23:20.333 --> 23:22.166
<i>…that six people a year died by choking</i>

23:22.250 --> 23:24.958
<i>when the tab came back out</i>
<i>and they swallowed it.</i>

23:25.458 --> 23:28.083
<i>I would always think that</i>
<i>maybe this could be the day.</i>

23:28.583 --> 23:31.041
<i>But like so many</i>
<i>of the doomsday scenarios,</i>

23:31.125 --> 23:32.833
<i>it thankfully never happened.</i>

23:33.541 --> 23:36.958
<i>But all the dissonance</i>
<i>was a lot to process for a young mind.</i>

23:37.041 --> 23:40.333
<i>On the one hand, okay,</i>
<i>the world was goin' to hell.</i>

23:43.541 --> 23:45.208
<i>We were in a war in Vietnam,</i>

23:45.291 --> 23:49.125
<i>but even more scary was the Cold War</i>
<i>we were in with the Soviet Union,</i>

23:49.208 --> 23:53.083
<i>who we were told at any minute</i>
<i>could be dropping a hydrogen bomb on us.</i>

23:53.666 --> 23:56.875
<i>Anyway, we were the last</i>
<i>of the duck-and-cover generation.</i>

24:00.416 --> 24:02.708
-<i>It's a bomb. Duck and cover.</i>

24:02.791 --> 24:04.791
-<i>I thought bein' under a desk</i>

24:04.875 --> 24:08.625
<i>wasn't gonna do much good</i>
<i>on the vaporization or radiation front.</i>

24:08.708 --> 24:10.291
<i>-But what the hell.</i>

24:10.791 --> 24:11.875
<i>You did the drill.</i>

24:14.125 --> 24:17.791
<i>But on the other hand,</i>
<i>the future was so cool and optimistic.</i>

24:17.875 --> 24:20.458
<i>-We were heading to the moon and beyond.</i>

24:21.333 --> 24:23.833
<i>It was easy to be swept up</i>
<i>in the promise of the future</i>

24:23.916 --> 24:25.833
<i>and the thought</i>
<i>that science and technology</i>

24:25.916 --> 24:28.541
<i>-would ultimately fix almost everything.</i>

24:28.625 --> 24:32.583
<i>At the top of the heap, the embodiment</i>
<i>of all these positive feelings was NASA</i>

24:32.666 --> 24:34.833
<i>and, of course, the astronauts themselves.</i>

24:36.750 --> 24:39.291
<i>-The names still roll off the tongue.</i>

24:39.375 --> 24:40.666
<i>The original Mercury guys,</i>

24:40.750 --> 24:43.916
<i>John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Alan Shepard,</i>

24:44.000 --> 24:45.833
<i>Walter Schirra, Gordon Cooper,</i>

24:45.916 --> 24:48.208
<i>Gus Grissom, Deke Slayton.</i>

24:48.291 --> 24:50.375
<i>Then the Apollo names became familiar.</i>

24:50.458 --> 24:53.125
<i>Pete Conrad, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,</i>

24:53.208 --> 24:55.125
<i>Michael Collins, Frank Borman,</i>

24:55.208 --> 24:56.875
<i>James Lovell, Gene Cernan,</i>

24:56.958 --> 24:58.791
<i>John Young, Alan Bean.</i>

24:58.875 --> 25:01.083
<i>They were the bravest. The best.</i>

25:01.166 --> 25:04.541
<i>This is a CBS News</i>
<i>special report.</i>

25:05.125 --> 25:09.916
<i>America's first three Apollo astronauts</i>
<i>were trapped and killed by a flash fire</i>

25:10.000 --> 25:13.166
<i>that swept their moon ship early tonight</i>
<i>during a launch pad test…</i>

25:13.250 --> 25:14.208
<i>When Gus Grissom,</i>

25:14.291 --> 25:17.791
<i>Roger Chaffee, and Ed White died</i>
<i>during a test for Apollo 1,</i>

25:18.416 --> 25:20.791
<i>-I remember my mom crying.</i>
Oh my God.

25:20.875 --> 25:24.125
<i>Our school was named Ed White Elementary</i>
<i>even before the tragedy.</i>

25:25.125 --> 25:27.250
<i>After, it became kind of a memorial.</i>

25:28.333 --> 25:31.500
<i>But the world was changing,</i>
<i>and so was how we saw ourselves in it.</i>

25:32.583 --> 25:35.041
<i>When Apollo 8 snapped</i>
<i>the famous Earthrise photo</i>

25:35.125 --> 25:36.958
<i>over the moon on Christmas Eve,</i>

25:37.541 --> 25:40.500
<i>it gave us Earthlings</i>
<i>a perspective we'd never had.</i>

25:41.875 --> 25:46.875
<i>There we were, all together</i>
<i>on this floating blue ball in space.</i>

25:46.958 --> 25:50.666
<i>It was said that someday soon,</i>
<i>when humans fully grasped what this meant,</i>

25:50.750 --> 25:54.458
<i>there would be a shift in consciousness,</i>
<i>and there would be no more wars.</i>

26:14.750 --> 26:17.125
<i>And back in our little part</i>
<i>of that blue ball,</i>

26:17.208 --> 26:18.875
<i>everywhere you looked,</i>

26:18.958 --> 26:22.125
<i>there were reminders of NASA</i>
<i>and the manned space program.</i>

26:23.375 --> 26:25.291
<i>On our playground,</i>
<i>there was a rocket slide</i>

26:25.375 --> 26:26.750
<i>you could climb up and pilot.</i>

26:27.250 --> 26:30.041
<i>I think everyone knew</i>
<i>spaceships didn't have steering wheels,</i>

26:30.125 --> 26:31.250
<i>but no matter.</i>

26:31.958 --> 26:34.875
<i>The space race was such</i>
<i>an all-pervasive element of our culture.</i>

26:34.958 --> 26:36.750
<i>It found its way into everything,</i>

26:37.250 --> 26:41.208
<i>including advertising and promotion,</i>
<i>however ridiculous.</i>

26:41.291 --> 26:43.041
<i>Howdy, folks! I'm Sam the Rocket Man!</i>

26:43.125 --> 26:45.750
<i>We're shootin' the moon</i>
<i>with out-of-this-world savings!</i>

26:45.833 --> 26:48.916
<i>The closer they get to the moon,</i>
<i>the lower our prices are.</i>

26:49.000 --> 26:50.416
<i>We'll trade anything.</i>

26:50.500 --> 26:54.000
<i>Used spaceships,</i>
<i>lunar modules, or even used cars!</i>

27:00.000 --> 27:03.125
<i>At school on launch days,</i>
<i>it was always the same ritual.</i>

27:03.625 --> 27:05.583
<i>The teacher would wheel in a TV.</i>

27:06.916 --> 27:08.750
<i>We'd watch the rocket on the launchpad</i>

27:08.833 --> 27:10.500
<i>-for five minutes…</i>
-<i>Fifteen…</i>

27:10.583 --> 27:14.541
<i>…and then all count down in unison</i>
<i>with the TV for the last ten seconds.</i>

27:14.625 --> 27:18.708
-Ten, nine, eight, seven…
-<i>Ignition sequence started.</i>

27:18.791 --> 27:21.375
Six, five, four…

27:21.458 --> 27:26.333
-<i>We have ignition.</i>
-Three, two, one, blastoff!

27:26.833 --> 27:30.416
-<i>We have liftoff. We have liftoff.</i>

27:32.875 --> 27:36.791
<i>And then just stare at the screen</i>
<i>as the rocket took off into the sky.</i>

27:37.333 --> 27:40.916
<i>Science class was so exciting,</i>
<i>because it felt like current events.</i>

27:41.416 --> 27:44.750
<i>It was all astronomy,</i>
<i>cosmology, and Apollo related.</i>

27:44.833 --> 27:48.291
Until Edwin Hubble
proved otherwise in 1922,

27:48.375 --> 27:52.916
humans thought the entire universe
might only consist of our galaxy.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.666
Now we know we are
but one of 100 <i>billion </i>galaxies.

27:58.916 --> 28:02.125
As of yet,
we have no proof of other solar systems

28:02.208 --> 28:06.083
revolving around distant stars
or planets outside our nine.

28:06.916 --> 28:10.125
But the odds that we're
the only nine planets in the universe

28:10.208 --> 28:12.333
and that we're
the only one with life on it,

28:12.416 --> 28:17.125
we've calculated out
at ten billion trillion to one.

28:17.208 --> 28:21.250
Yes, whatever was going on
in the formation of our solar system

28:21.333 --> 28:24.083
is undoubtedly going on in others, right?

28:24.166 --> 28:28.250
It's the same material,
gravity, and conditions everywhere.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.875
In other words,
there's just no way that we're alone.

28:30.958 --> 28:34.083
It's just a matter of time
before we have an encounter

28:34.166 --> 28:38.708
with other beings from other places
in the universe, if we haven't already.

28:44.625 --> 28:48.000
<i>We'd already gone to Jupiter</i>
<i>and beyond in the movie</i> 2001,

28:48.583 --> 28:51.083
<i>and there was no doubt</i>
<i>we'd be there soon enough.</i>

28:56.583 --> 28:58.375
<i>I remember bein' so entranced by the film,</i>

28:58.458 --> 29:00.666
<i>I would try to describe</i>
<i>the deeper meaning of it</i>

29:00.750 --> 29:02.166
<i>to anyone who would listen.</i>

29:03.541 --> 29:05.541
And then as he goes past Jupiter,

29:05.625 --> 29:08.166
he goes through
this kind of crazy time warp.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.791
There are
all these bright lights flashing by,

29:10.875 --> 29:13.500
and suddenly he's in this old room,

29:13.583 --> 29:16.458
and then he's this old man.

29:16.541 --> 29:19.250
Then he sees the black slab,

29:19.333 --> 29:21.500
the same one from Jupiter,

29:21.583 --> 29:23.666
at the foot of his deathbed.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.416
Or is it?

29:25.916 --> 29:28.291
He reaches out, trying to touch it,

29:28.375 --> 29:31.833
and then he turns into a baby
that hasn't even been born yet!

29:34.125 --> 29:35.625
Go back, go back!

29:35.708 --> 29:38.208
-No, it's going-- Run, run!
-Back, back, back, back!

29:38.958 --> 29:41.333
<i>Well, like I said,</i>
<i>it was all around us.</i>

29:42.083 --> 29:43.958
<i>We were being told that people our age</i>

29:44.041 --> 29:46.583
<i>would one day be able</i>
<i>to have our honeymoons on the moon.</i>

29:47.166 --> 29:48.625
<i>And by the end of the century,</i>

29:48.708 --> 29:52.000
<i>we could be a paying customer</i>
<i>on the six-month flight to Mars.</i>

29:52.500 --> 29:54.291
<i>It was all so close.</i>

29:54.791 --> 29:58.208
<i>We literally had the astronauts themselves</i>
<i>buzzing above us in jets</i>

29:58.291 --> 30:00.500
<i>because Ellington Air Force Base</i>
<i>was down the road.</i>

30:00.583 --> 30:02.416
<i>-It wasn't at all unusual</i>

30:02.500 --> 30:05.041
<i>to suddenly hear a whoosh low in the sky,</i>

30:05.125 --> 30:08.125
<i>see a jet streak by and disappear quickly,</i>

30:08.750 --> 30:12.500
<i>and then hear the sonic boom</i>
<i>of the sound barrier bein' broken.</i>

30:17.208 --> 30:19.583
<i>We'd run home as quickly</i>
<i>as we could from school</i>

30:19.666 --> 30:23.416
<i>to watch </i>Dark Shadows,
<i>a show we all got obsessed with.</i>

30:25.583 --> 30:27.458
<i>It was a truly bizarre and scary tale</i>

30:27.541 --> 30:30.958
<i>of an old patrician family</i>
<i>livin' in a castle by the sea</i>

30:31.041 --> 30:32.625
<i>and one ageless vampire…</i>

30:32.708 --> 30:34.833
-Ugh!
-<i>…Barnabas Collins.</i>

30:42.500 --> 30:44.833
<i>TV itself felt like an ongoing battle.</i>

30:44.916 --> 30:46.750
<i>First off, just gettin' decent reception</i>

30:46.833 --> 30:50.166
<i>in this era of antennas</i>
<i>and three major networks was a challenge.</i>

30:50.666 --> 30:54.166
<i>Then, in our family at least,</i>
<i>you had to stake out your territory</i>

30:54.250 --> 30:57.000
<i>and often bodily defend</i>
<i>what would be coming out of the tube</i>

30:57.083 --> 30:58.291
<i>for the next 30 minutes.</i>

30:58.875 --> 31:01.166
<i>There were so many great shows</i>
<i>going all evening.</i>

31:01.250 --> 31:03.791
<i>It was often hard to choose,</i>
<i>and they never let you down.</i>

31:03.875 --> 31:06.250
-The Beverly Hillbillies,

31:06.333 --> 31:07.333
Gunsmoke,

31:07.416 --> 31:08.541
My Three Sons,

31:08.625 --> 31:10.333
The Munsters, Bonanza,

31:10.416 --> 31:11.250
Bewitched,

31:11.333 --> 31:12.333
Star Trek,

31:12.416 --> 31:14.250
Adam-12,Get Smart,

31:14.333 --> 31:15.750
Gomer Pyle, Batman,

31:15.833 --> 31:17.333
-Gilligan, Flipper…

31:17.416 --> 31:19.666
…Petticoat Junction, Andy Griffith,

31:19.750 --> 31:21.833
I Dream of Jeannie, The Addams Family,

31:21.916 --> 31:23.000
Dick Van Dyke,

31:23.083 --> 31:24.833
The Green Hornet, McHale's Navy,

31:24.916 --> 31:26.083
Impossible,

31:26.166 --> 31:27.750
Green Acres, Hogan's Heroes,

31:27.833 --> 31:31.000
Dragnet <i>and </i>Hawaii Five-O,
<i>to name but a few.</i>

31:31.083 --> 31:34.000
<i>Then there were the shows</i>
<i>that never made it past one season</i>

31:34.083 --> 31:36.833
<i>and are mostly forgotten, but not by me.</i>

31:36.916 --> 31:40.250
<i>In </i>The Time Tunnel,
<i>two scientists are lost in time,</i>

31:40.333 --> 31:42.708
<i>always landing</i>
<i>at choice moments in history.</i>

31:42.791 --> 31:45.375
<i>The Titanic,</i>
<i>Little Bighorn, Ford's Theatre.</i>

31:46.500 --> 31:49.000
<i>Then there was a show called</i>
It's About Time,

31:49.083 --> 31:52.208
<i>a comedy about two astronauts</i>
<i>that, upon reentry,</i>

31:52.291 --> 31:54.041
<i>find themselves in a time warp,</i>

31:54.666 --> 31:56.083
<i>now living in prehistoric times</i>

31:56.166 --> 31:58.416
<i>-with cavemen and dinosaurs.</i>
<i>-I don't believe it!</i>

31:59.708 --> 32:01.500
<i>-I believe it!</i>
<i>-I do too!</i>

32:03.000 --> 32:05.541
<i>It was also</i>
<i>the first wave of syndication…</i>

32:05.625 --> 32:07.750
<i>-It's so tasty!</i>
<i>-…where shows from slightly earlier eras</i>

32:07.833 --> 32:09.625
<i>-were also on all the time.</i>
<i>-I'm Mister Ed.</i>

32:09.708 --> 32:11.333
<i>And late at night, there would still be</i>

32:11.416 --> 32:13.541
Twilight Zone<i> episodes.</i>

32:13.625 --> 32:16.000
<i>When I was really little,</i>
<i>before I knew what it was,</i>

32:16.083 --> 32:19.000
<i>I called it </i>The Scary Flying Eyeball Show.

32:19.083 --> 32:22.458
<i>A dimension of sight.</i>
<i>A dimension of mind.</i>

32:23.125 --> 32:27.666
<i>You're moving into a land of both shadow</i>
<i>and substance, of things and ideas.</i>

32:27.750 --> 32:29.958
-<i>Then there were Saturday mornings.</i>

32:30.041 --> 32:32.375
<i>We'd get up early</i>
<i>and stare at the test patterns</i>

32:32.458 --> 32:34.208
<i>and wait for the fun to begin.</i>

32:36.833 --> 32:40.333
<i>Late on Saturday nights,</i>
<i>there was a local show called </i>Weird

32:40.416 --> 32:42.833
<i>-that opened with a creepy theremin piece.</i>

32:42.916 --> 32:46.166
<i>Welcome to </i>Weird.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.208
<i>They showed movies like</i> <i>the</i>
Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,

32:50.791 --> 32:52.541
-The Incredible Shrinking Man…

32:53.125 --> 32:55.458
…The Thing, The Beginning of The End…

32:55.541 --> 32:57.000
-…The Blob,

32:57.708 --> 32:59.541
-Attack of the Mushroom People.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.666
<i>Basically, anything</i>
<i>with atomic bomb-induced mutations.</i>

33:03.750 --> 33:06.250
-<i>This concludes our broadcasting.</i>
-Good night.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.958
-<i>And now our national anthem.</i>

33:09.041 --> 33:11.333
<i>-It would come to an end around midnight…</i>
-Hey.

33:11.416 --> 33:14.458
<i>-…and the stations would go off the air.</i>
-Hey. Turn everything off.

33:15.375 --> 33:19.458
<i>By Sunday nights during the school year,</i>
<i>a feeling of outright dread set in.</i>

33:19.541 --> 33:21.916
-The Wonderful World of Color,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.416
<i>which is what it was called before it was</i>
The Wonderful World of Disney,

33:25.916 --> 33:28.458
<i>was lathered in this melancholy feeling.</i>

33:29.083 --> 33:30.875
<i>With school looming the next morning,</i>

33:30.958 --> 33:33.125
<i>-no matter how good that particular show…</i>
-Hey.

33:33.708 --> 33:37.041
<i>…the freedom and fun of the weekend</i>
<i>was coming to a close.</i>

33:37.958 --> 33:39.208
<i>And then, once a year,</i>

33:39.291 --> 33:42.416
<i>there would be a special screening</i>
<i>of </i>The Wizard of Oz <i>on TV.</i>

33:43.375 --> 33:45.333
<i>We would all gather around and watch.</i>

33:46.708 --> 33:48.875
-It's gonna go to color real soon, and it…
-No!

33:48.958 --> 33:50.916
<i>It was so much more than a movie.</i>

33:52.291 --> 33:55.375
<i>Until we got a color TV,</i>
<i>everything had been in black and white,</i>

33:55.458 --> 33:56.458
<i>even Oz.</i>

33:58.833 --> 34:00.958
<i>But whether in color or black and white,</i>

<i>the flying monkeys</i>
<i>always sent my sister Stephanie…</i>

34:03.500 --> 34:04.791
<i>-…either under the covers</i>

34:04.875 --> 34:06.708
<i>-or out the door.</i>
<i>-Now fly! Fly!</i>

34:08.750 --> 34:09.583
<i>Fly!</i>

34:09.666 --> 34:11.666
-<i>The latest casualties…</i>
-<i>On the news,</i>

34:11.750 --> 34:13.625
<i>the war in Vietnam was a constant,</i>

34:13.708 --> 34:16.125
<i>and found its way</i>
<i>into almost everything goin' on.</i>

34:16.208 --> 34:20.083
<i>The US Command reports</i>
<i>148 Americans killed in the war last week…</i>

34:20.166 --> 34:21.958
<i>For a kid, it was confusing.</i>

34:22.500 --> 34:24.541
<i>Adults were always guilt-tripping us.</i>

34:24.625 --> 34:28.416
Everyone, finish every bite on your plate.
There are starving kids in Vietnam.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.625
<i>We were at war with them, bombing them,</i>

34:33.708 --> 34:35.791
<i>but we cared about</i>
<i>their starving children?</i>

34:38.083 --> 34:39.583
-Pass, pass!
-Go, go, go.

34:39.666 --> 34:41.041
-Gimme!
-Here!

34:41.833 --> 34:43.416
-Pass, pass!
-Here! Throw it!

34:44.791 --> 34:47.000
<i>What made it</i>
<i>a perfect neighborhood to grow up in</i>

34:47.083 --> 34:50.083
<i>was there were a ton of young families</i>
<i>with kids in our age range.</i>

34:50.666 --> 34:52.166
<i>It was no problem gettin' a game goin'.</i>

34:52.875 --> 34:56.958
<i>We'd play in someone's front yard,</i>
<i>the street, or, for some things,</i>

34:57.458 --> 34:59.833
<i>we'd go down</i>
<i>to where the housing development ended,</i>

34:59.916 --> 35:03.041
<i>and there was a big field</i>
<i>with a water treatment plant.</i>

35:03.125 --> 35:05.208
<i>We called it Sewer Park.</i>

35:06.000 --> 35:07.458
<i>When it was raining or at night,</i>

35:07.541 --> 35:09.708
<i>my brother Greg and I invented</i>
<i>a baseball game</i>

35:09.791 --> 35:11.458
<i>we could play in the garage.</i>

35:12.833 --> 35:15.958
Astros superstar Jim Wynn is up to bat.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.041
Home run!

35:19.625 --> 35:21.750
The Toy Cannon!

35:22.791 --> 35:27.166
And the scoreboard is going crazy
on the line drive!

35:28.375 --> 35:31.333
<i>We'd have a baseball card draft</i>
<i>and create a team,</i>

35:31.416 --> 35:34.166
<i>with all roads</i>
<i>leading to our own World Series.</i>

35:35.833 --> 35:39.500
<i>This was just before the Nerf ball</i>
<i>was invented and changed everything.</i>

35:41.666 --> 35:43.833
<i>Occasionally,</i>
<i>there'd be a bench-clearing brawl.</i>

35:43.916 --> 35:49.500
Next up, Boog Powell!

35:52.125 --> 35:53.666
That's it!

35:55.958 --> 35:57.541
-Charge!
-Aah!

35:57.625 --> 36:00.208
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>all the kids in the neighborhood.</i>

36:00.291 --> 36:03.541
<i>There was Larry,</i>
<i>who had a severe case of ringworm.</i>

36:04.541 --> 36:07.125
<i>It seemed like everyone</i>
<i>in the neighborhood took turns</i>

36:07.208 --> 36:08.833
<i>bein' the kid with a cast on.</i>

36:10.541 --> 36:13.333
<i>Of course, there was Byron,</i>
<i>the son of a NASA scientist</i>

36:13.416 --> 36:16.166
<i>and the local pyromaniac chemistry set kid</i>

36:16.875 --> 36:20.458
<i>who was always building</i>
<i>little rocket-like propulsion devices.</i>

36:20.541 --> 36:23.375
<i>Occasionally,</i>
<i>he'd put a grasshopper in the pilot seat.</i>

36:23.458 --> 36:27.083
-Three, two, one!

36:33.791 --> 36:37.333
<i>Then there was Tony, the witty</i>
<i>smart aleck who would get you in trouble.</i>

36:37.416 --> 36:41.000
<i>
<i>-He specialized in changing the lyrics</i></i>

36:41.083 --> 36:43.208
<i>-to songs in music class…</i>
-Now to page 24.

36:43.291 --> 36:46.250
<i>…from traditional to, of course, dirty.</i>
-<i>Old Dan Tucker.</i>

36:57.625 --> 36:58.458
Balls!

36:58.541 --> 37:01.083
Stan, Tony,go stand out in the hall.

37:03.166 --> 37:05.458
<i>One of the downsides</i>
<i>of bein' a kid during this era</i>

37:05.541 --> 37:09.250
<i>was they still thought it was a great idea</i>
<i>to train children like they were animals,</i>

37:09.333 --> 37:13.208
<i>which required constant reminders</i>
<i>of what was incorrect conduct.</i>

37:13.791 --> 37:16.333
<i>You were always one little screw-up</i>
<i>away from a beating</i>

37:16.416 --> 37:18.333
<i>from any number</i>
<i>of the adults in your life.</i>

37:18.958 --> 37:20.875
<i>Parents, principals, coaches,</i>

37:20.958 --> 37:23.583
<i>even your friends' parents</i>
<i>who had these convenient</i>

37:23.666 --> 37:26.291
<i>"You can paddle my kid</i>
<i>and I can paddle yours" agreements.</i>

37:27.250 --> 37:30.458
<i>But nobody was more scary</i>
<i>than our principal,</i>

37:30.541 --> 37:32.208
<i>the Grim Reaper himself,</i>

37:32.708 --> 37:33.625
<i>Mr. Cowan.</i>

37:36.125 --> 37:38.958
Are you boys out here
for disciplinary reasons?

37:43.791 --> 37:44.875
Again.

37:46.708 --> 37:47.583
Follow me.

37:57.166 --> 37:59.875
-No. No, no, no, no.
-All right. Get back to class.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.666
Tony, Stan,

38:13.375 --> 38:14.625
get in here.

38:14.708 --> 38:16.333
<i>I guess it fit the times.</i>

38:16.416 --> 38:17.666
<i>Life was cheaper.</i>

38:17.750 --> 38:19.416
<i>We were all more expendable,</i>

38:19.500 --> 38:22.000
<i>and no one thought too deeply</i>
<i>about safety.</i>

38:26.333 --> 38:31.041
<i>For instance, there we are, drivin' down</i>
<i>the Gulf Freeway at 70 miles an hour,</i>

38:31.541 --> 38:34.166
<i>with a truck bed full of kids</i>
<i>on the way to the beach.</i>

38:34.666 --> 38:36.166
<i>It never crossed anyone's mind</i>

38:36.250 --> 38:40.375
<i>that we were all just one slight collision</i>
<i>or rollover away from being roadkill.</i>

38:43.541 --> 38:47.333
<i>Just all of us gettin' Popsicles</i>
<i>at the pool could turn into a disaster.</i>

38:47.416 --> 38:49.291
-Aah… Aah! Aah!

38:49.375 --> 38:52.708
<i>Something about the way they were frozen</i>
<i>had turned them into dry ice,</i>

38:52.791 --> 38:54.791
<i>-and they stuck to all of our tongues.</i>

38:55.583 --> 38:58.833
<i>Also, our neighborhood swimming pool</i>
<i>was routinely over chlorinated,</i>

38:58.916 --> 39:01.291
<i>absolutely roasting everyone's eyes.</i>

39:02.583 --> 39:05.666
<i>They just hadn't perfected</i>
<i>the chemical thing yet,</i>

39:05.750 --> 39:09.291
<i>and it hadn't entered our minds that</i>
<i>anything they were doing could be harmful.</i>

39:09.375 --> 39:12.250
<i>And we were definitely the last</i>
<i>of maybe two generations of kids</i>

39:12.333 --> 39:13.625
<i>who thought it was great fun</i>

39:13.708 --> 39:16.708
<i>to chase after</i>
<i>those DDT-spewing mosquito trucks.</i>

39:17.208 --> 39:19.416
<i>And it wasn't at all uncommon</i>
<i>to return home</i>

39:19.500 --> 39:22.416
<i>to find they'd nerve-gassed</i>
<i>the entire house with poison</i>

39:22.500 --> 39:25.083
<i>to kill that occasional roach</i>
<i>that had been spotted.</i>

39:26.708 --> 39:30.458
<i>And check out my Little League coach's</i>
<i>unique motivational technique.</i>

39:30.541 --> 39:33.625
<i>For every error you committed</i>
<i>in the previous game,</i>

39:33.708 --> 39:35.916
<i>you had to stand</i>
<i>before three of your teammates,</i>

39:36.000 --> 39:39.291
<i>firing squad style,</i>
<i>trying to peg you with the ball.</i>

39:41.750 --> 39:45.541
<i>My strategy was to try and catch</i>
<i>the one from the most accurate thrower,</i>

39:45.625 --> 39:48.750
<i>dodge one,</i>
<i>and just hope the other guy missed.</i>

39:48.833 --> 39:50.875
<i>You might just get out alive.</i>

39:50.958 --> 39:52.708
<i>Yep. Amongst all the fun,</i>

39:52.791 --> 39:57.041
<i>it always seemed like punishment,</i>
<i>pain, or injury were never too far away.</i>

39:57.583 --> 39:59.750
<i>Like this game we used to play</i>
<i>called Red Rover.</i>

39:59.833 --> 40:04.458
Red rover, red rover
Let Stan come over

40:07.916 --> 40:13.208
Red rover, red rover
Let Ronnie come over

40:13.708 --> 40:16.708
<i>We'd keep playin' certain games</i>
<i>until somethin' like this happened.</i>

40:19.458 --> 40:22.291
<i>That simply meant</i>
<i>we'd now matured to a new level,</i>

40:22.375 --> 40:25.750
<i>and it was time to quit playin' that game</i>
<i>and pick up a new one.</i>

40:26.333 --> 40:28.750
<i>If it wasn't baseball,</i>
<i>football, or basketball,</i>

40:28.833 --> 40:30.875
<i>it was goin' off on a big bike adventure.</i>

40:35.708 --> 40:37.958
<i>We all got good at bike repair,</i>

40:38.041 --> 40:40.125
<i>especially fixing flat tires.</i>

40:41.458 --> 40:43.791
<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>every longer car ride anywhere</i>

40:43.875 --> 40:46.416
<i>included an obligatory changing of a flat.</i>

40:47.375 --> 40:50.375
<i>It might have been that we were</i>
<i>in the pre-steel-belted radial era,</i>

40:50.458 --> 40:52.458
<i>and they just</i>
<i>weren't very good at tires yet,</i>

40:53.041 --> 40:55.666
<i>or the fact that Dad had</i>
<i>a penchant for buying used tires.</i>

40:55.750 --> 40:58.958
-Come on.
-Ever thought about gettin' a new tire?

40:59.458 --> 41:03.041
Then it wouldn't match the other three,
and it would look funny, Steven.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.833
<i>We had all kinds of neighborhood games,</i>
<i>depending on who was playing.</i>

41:08.333 --> 41:11.916
<i>If there were a lot of girls around,</i>
<i>all the guys' sisters, usually,</i>

41:12.000 --> 41:14.500
<i>there was this game we played</i>
<i>called Statue Maker…</i>

41:14.583 --> 41:16.000
Watch out.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.666
<i>…where you'd have to say</i>
<i>what you were a statue of.</i>

41:20.125 --> 41:21.083
Pancake.

41:21.166 --> 41:22.083
A phoenix.

41:22.166 --> 41:23.208
A wave.

41:23.291 --> 41:24.500
Astronaut.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.791
<i>At night, the games moved indoors</i>

41:28.375 --> 41:29.666
<i>or on the back porch.</i>

41:30.291 --> 41:32.375
<i>So many classic board games.</i>

41:32.500 --> 41:34.333
-Five…
-Five, six, seven…

41:34.416 --> 41:36.416
<i>Sometimes when my folks</i>
<i>would be entertaining</i>

41:36.500 --> 41:38.458
<i>and other families would be visiting,</i>

41:38.541 --> 41:41.791
<i>we'd get all elaborate and set up</i>
<i>other games like bobbing for apples.</i>

41:41.875 --> 41:43.333
Watch and learn.

41:43.416 --> 41:46.000
New world record right now.

41:46.083 --> 41:47.458
Three, two, one, go.

41:47.541 --> 41:51.166
<i>At some point, Greg came up with</i>
<i>a foolproof way to win every time.</i>

41:52.125 --> 41:56.333
<i>He was so dominant and adamant about it,</i>
<i>we all just sort of quit playing.</i>

41:56.416 --> 41:57.666
That's how you do it!

42:01.416 --> 42:04.041
<i>While my three sisters were,</i>
<i>for the most part, the opposition,</i>

42:04.708 --> 42:06.833
<i>they weren't without some advantages.</i>

42:07.333 --> 42:09.750
<i>Vicky had gotten a job at Baskin-Robbins…</i>

42:09.833 --> 42:11.583
-All right.
<i>-…the revolutionary ice-cream shop</i>

42:11.666 --> 42:14.833
<i>that offered a mind-blowing</i>
<i>31 different flavors,</i>

42:14.916 --> 42:17.000
<i>and she got two free scoops a shift.</i>

42:17.083 --> 42:19.583
I think I'll have the banana nut fudge.

42:20.416 --> 42:21.250
Good choice.

42:21.333 --> 42:25.083
<i>For the first two or three months</i>
<i>she worked there, she ate them herself.</i>

42:25.583 --> 42:28.791
<i>But eventually, she got sick of ice cream</i>
<i>and started givin' 'em away,</i>

42:28.875 --> 42:31.666
<i>so you wanted to be there</i>
<i>when she was gettin' off work.</i>

42:32.333 --> 42:33.166
Thank you.

42:34.791 --> 42:38.041
Need I guess what flavor I must serve up
to earn my ride home?

42:39.333 --> 42:40.166
Just…

42:40.958 --> 42:42.291
You can say it.

42:42.375 --> 42:43.208
Vanilla, please.

42:43.291 --> 42:44.541
-Vanilla?
Yeah, vanilla.

42:44.625 --> 42:45.958
-You want vanilla?
-Yes.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.083
-Of all these flavors, you want--
-Yes.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.000
Just scoop it.

42:49.083 --> 42:50.291
Okay.

42:50.375 --> 42:51.208
Yeah.

42:51.708 --> 42:55.583
<i>I don't remember my brother Steve</i>
<i>ever getting a flavor besides vanilla.</i>

42:55.666 --> 42:58.875
<i>A waste of all those exotic flavors,</i>
<i>obviously,</i>

42:58.958 --> 43:02.208
<i>but I guess I admired</i>
<i>his contentment and consistency.</i>

43:04.083 --> 43:07.125
<i>My sisters also seemed to set the tone</i>
<i>musically in the house,</i>

43:07.208 --> 43:10.041
<i>and between them,</i>
<i>they covered a lot of ground.</i>

43:10.125 --> 43:13.166
<i>The youngest, Stephanie,</i>
<i>liked whatever was popular.</i>

43:13.250 --> 43:16.791
<i>I remember her listening to her 45</i>
<i>of The Archies' "Sugar Sugar"</i>

43:16.875 --> 43:19.333
<i>over and over again.</i>

43:19.416 --> 43:21.666
<i>The Archies were characters</i>
<i>out of a comic book,</i>

43:21.750 --> 43:24.708
<i>but that didn't keep 'em</i>
<i>from havin' the biggest hit of 1969.</i>

43:32.750 --> 43:33.583
All right.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.291
-Last time, all right?

43:36.375 --> 43:38.208
-Fine.
-I've had enough of this.

43:39.708 --> 43:43.958
<i>My middle sister, Jana, loved The Monkees</i>
<i>and, come to think of it,</i>

43:44.041 --> 43:46.416
<i>pretty much any group</i>
<i>that had cute guys in it.</i>

43:48.958 --> 43:51.291
<i>My tastes were, let's say, maturing.</i>

43:51.375 --> 43:53.333
<i>To Herb Alpert, for instance.</i>

43:53.416 --> 43:56.625
<i>Or at least</i>
<i>one particular album cover of his.</i>

43:59.125 --> 44:01.666
<i>Vicky had</i>
<i>the coolest taste in music, of course,</i>

44:01.750 --> 44:05.291
<i>and would happily lecture us</i>
<i>on the deeper meanings of songs.</i>

44:08.958 --> 44:11.041
It's like the true meanings
are snuck in there,

44:11.125 --> 44:15.833
and we have to decipher them,
like "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."

44:17.458 --> 44:18.500
LSD.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.041
It's right there for those who are
tuned in, but the straights…

44:23.625 --> 44:24.833
they don't get it.

44:27.333 --> 44:29.583
Oh God! Turn it off,
turn it off, turn it off!

44:31.666 --> 44:33.125
-Oh no!
-Breathe. Okay.

44:33.833 --> 44:35.166
Oh, Jana!

44:35.250 --> 44:37.583
-<i>Jana was always having mishaps.</i>
-Stop, stop. I'm pulling it.

44:37.666 --> 44:41.333
<i>She was the first to have to get stitches,</i>
<i>the first to break a bone.</i>

44:41.416 --> 44:42.875
-Oh!
<i>-Stuff just happened to her.</i>

44:42.958 --> 44:45.791
<i>And it seemed like a lot of extra work</i>
<i>bein' a girl.</i>

44:46.291 --> 44:49.291
<i>Straight hair was the look</i>
<i>everyone was goin' for at the time,</i>

44:49.375 --> 44:52.125
<i>but it was so difficult</i>
<i>in the humidity of Houston.</i>

44:52.625 --> 44:55.375
<i>And this was before</i>
<i>all the hair products and blow dryers.</i>

44:56.458 --> 45:00.250
<i>The curlers were so small back then,</i>
<i>they took to usin' orange juice cans.</i>

45:00.333 --> 45:04.083
<i>My sisters were not only more resourceful</i>
<i>but much more dramatic.</i>

45:04.750 --> 45:06.166
Ouija, are you with us?

45:13.250 --> 45:14.625
-Yes!
-Oh my gosh!

45:14.708 --> 45:15.750
Shh.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.125
That's good.

45:18.708 --> 45:20.458
Does Robert have a crush on me?

45:25.416 --> 45:27.750
-Yes!

45:27.833 --> 45:30.583
<i>In our bedroom, Steve, Greg,</i>
<i>and I were in agreement</i>

45:30.666 --> 45:32.916
<i>that the ultimate woman was Raquel Welch,</i>

45:33.000 --> 45:36.166
<i>as seen in such movies as</i>
One Million Years BC,

45:36.250 --> 45:38.916
Fantastic Voyage,<i> and </i>Bandolero!

45:39.000 --> 45:42.041
<i>Steve had a stash of </i>Playboys
<i>hidden under the desk.</i>

46:02.583 --> 46:05.333
<i>We never found out</i>
<i>which sister ratted us out.</i>

46:05.833 --> 46:08.083
<i>-The radio was always on,</i>

46:08.166 --> 46:10.083
<i>-playing the hits.</i>

46:10.166 --> 46:15.750
<i>One of my favorites was "In The Year 2525"</i>
<i>with its ominous dystopian future.</i>

46:19.083 --> 46:22.208
<i>I noticed a lot of girls I knew</i>
<i>had songs with their names in them.</i>

46:43.250 --> 46:45.791
<i>There was one notable song</i>
<i>with a guy's name in it,</i>

46:45.875 --> 46:47.083
<i>but his name was Sue.</i>

46:55.666 --> 46:58.958
<i>We loved the ending</i>
<i>where they had to bleep out a curse word.</i>

47:06.333 --> 47:10.083
<i>It has to be said that this was</i>
<i>the height of the prank call era,</i>

47:10.166 --> 47:12.083
<i>more than a decade before caller ID.</i>

47:12.166 --> 47:14.166
<i>We ranged from the basics, like…</i>

47:14.250 --> 47:15.833
Do you have Prince Albert in the can?

47:16.958 --> 47:18.833
Well, you'd better let him out.

47:21.125 --> 47:22.500
<i>To the much more elaborate…</i>

47:22.583 --> 47:26.791
Hello. It's Tommy O at KRB
and Name That Tune.

47:26.875 --> 47:28.583
Who am I speaking with?

47:28.666 --> 47:30.208
<i>Um, my name is Martha.</i>

47:30.291 --> 47:32.708
Martha? It's your lucky day, Martha!

47:32.791 --> 47:35.666
Our jackpot's up to $285,

47:35.750 --> 47:37.708
and it's all yours
if you can name this tune

47:37.791 --> 47:40.375
after hearing five seconds of the song.

47:40.458 --> 47:41.541
Are you ready?

47:41.625 --> 47:43.000
<i>Um, I guess so.</i>

47:43.500 --> 47:45.125
Name this tune.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.875
Martha, can you name that tune?

47:58.958 --> 48:00.625
<i>Is that "Wichita Lineman?"</i>

48:00.708 --> 48:03.125
Yes! "Wichita Lineman"!
You've won the jackpot!

48:06.041 --> 48:08.208
Jana, go get that. Tell 'em we're eating.

48:09.583 --> 48:10.416
-Who is that?

48:10.500 --> 48:11.583
-So rude.
-I know.

48:11.666 --> 48:13.500
<i>-Conversely, Dad had the answer…</i>
-Hello?

48:13.583 --> 48:17.333
<i>…when our household was the continual</i>
<i>target of one prank caller.</i>

48:17.416 --> 48:18.333
It's him again.

48:18.916 --> 48:21.208
I got something for that little shit.

48:25.916 --> 48:26.750
Hello?

48:27.916 --> 48:30.583
Oh, that's, uh… that's very interesting.

48:31.250 --> 48:33.916
Well, you listen carefully to this.

48:37.875 --> 48:39.541
-Dad!

48:40.291 --> 48:42.500
That should split his eardrum.

48:42.583 --> 48:45.750
<i>I remember actually feeling</i>
<i>a little sorry for the prankster.</i>

48:45.833 --> 48:47.791
<i>Not sure the punishment fit the crime.</i>

48:49.583 --> 48:52.041
<i>When we weren't playing</i>
<i>in the Little League ourselves,</i>

48:52.125 --> 48:54.625
<i>we'd hang out at the fields</i>
<i>to watch our friends play</i>

48:54.708 --> 48:57.458
<i>and pretty much just fart around</i>
<i>and chase foul balls.</i>

48:58.958 --> 49:01.916
<i>Bring that foul ball back</i>
<i>for a free snow cone!</i>

49:04.750 --> 49:07.375
-Okay.
-I'll have strawberry.

49:07.458 --> 49:10.875
-That's one foul ball.
-And a Chick-O-Stick.

49:13.166 --> 49:14.208
There's yours.

49:15.875 --> 49:16.708
And yours.

49:16.791 --> 49:18.333
Thank you, sir.

49:19.333 --> 49:22.916
<i>You could also get a free snow cone</i>
<i>by pickin' up a bag of trash.</i>

49:33.708 --> 49:35.333
<i>I trust in God.</i>

49:35.416 --> 49:36.708
<i>I love my country</i>

49:36.791 --> 49:38.458
<i>-and will respect its laws.</i>

49:38.541 --> 49:41.000
<i>I will play fair and strive to win.</i>

49:41.083 --> 49:44.250
<i>But win or lose, I will always do my best.</i>

49:44.333 --> 49:50.083
<i>Now look to the flag in center field</i>
<i>as we play our national anthem.</i>

49:53.916 --> 49:56.541
<i>I felt so moved</i>
<i>by the Little League pledge</i>

49:56.625 --> 49:59.291
<i>and the national anthem</i>
<i>that I felt it wasn't important</i>

49:59.375 --> 50:00.333
<i>if we won or lost.</i>

50:01.500 --> 50:05.208
<i>That sentiment usually lasted</i>
<i>until about the first pitch of the game.</i>

50:18.125 --> 50:22.291
<i>But there was no better babysitter</i>
<i>than a triple feature at the Majestic,</i>

50:23.166 --> 50:25.625
<i>which, despite its name,</i>
<i>was a pretty seedy theater.</i>

50:26.333 --> 50:30.000
<i>I remember one line-up that featured</i>
<i>a sci-fi movie called </i>Countdown

50:30.083 --> 50:32.166
<i>where the moon race ends</i>
<i>with us gettin' there,</i>

50:32.250 --> 50:34.750
<i>only to find</i>
<i>the Russians had made it there, too,</i>

50:35.250 --> 50:38.125
<i>but had, of course, died</i>
<i>in a crash landing of some kind.</i>

50:39.083 --> 50:41.916
<i>As a gesture,</i>
<i>the American astronaut puts out the flags</i>

50:42.000 --> 50:44.750
<i>of both the United States</i>
<i>and the Soviet Union.</i>

50:45.625 --> 50:46.916
<i>Now a mad world!</i>

50:47.500 --> 50:49.666
<i>And then</i>
<i>there were two scary movies.</i>

50:49.750 --> 50:51.333
-The Frozen Dead…
-<i>I must!</i>

50:51.416 --> 50:55.791
<i>…where a mad Nazi scientist plans</i>
<i>to revive a number of frozen Nazi leaders.</i>

50:58.875 --> 51:00.083
<i>And</i> It,

51:00.583 --> 51:04.166
<i>in which a crazed museum assistant,</i>
<i>played by Roddy McDowall,</i>

51:04.250 --> 51:08.666
<i>brings a 16th-century golem to life</i>
<i>by putting a little scroll in its mouth.</i>

51:09.375 --> 51:11.708
<i>It's indestructible,</i>
<i>according to the prophecy,</i>

51:11.791 --> 51:14.708
<i>and becomes his accomplice</i>
<i>in murder and lots of mayhem.</i>

51:14.791 --> 51:15.625
Kill him!

51:25.125 --> 51:28.083
<i>The movie ends</i>
<i>with the golem walking into the sea.</i>

51:28.583 --> 51:30.500
<i>There weren't really sequels back then,</i>

51:30.583 --> 51:33.458
<i>so as far as I know,</i>
<i>the golem never came walking back out.</i>

51:38.000 --> 51:40.708
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>the New Year's Eve party my parents had</i>

51:40.791 --> 51:44.333
<i>as it was becoming</i>
<i>that fateful year of 1969.</i>

51:44.833 --> 51:46.666
<i>While the adults partied inside,</i>

51:47.250 --> 51:51.375
<i>most of us were in the backyard</i>
<i>where the Roman candle wars were raging.</i>

51:56.708 --> 51:58.291
<i>And Byron's pyromania</i>

51:58.375 --> 52:02.250
<i>had reached a new height</i>
<i>with a large chunk of drainage pipe,</i>

52:02.333 --> 52:03.833
<i>a small explosion,</i>

52:03.916 --> 52:06.291
<i>and a flaming softball across the sky.</i>

52:09.833 --> 52:11.916
Are you guys ready
for the countdown?

52:12.000 --> 52:13.666
Okay. Here we go.

52:14.333 --> 52:16.416
Ten, nine,

52:16.500 --> 52:18.458
eight, seven,

52:18.541 --> 52:19.833
six,

52:19.916 --> 52:21.750
five, four,

52:21.833 --> 52:24.458
three, two, one.

52:24.541 --> 52:26.333
-Happy New Year!

52:41.500 --> 52:45.166
<i>I guess this is as good a place</i>
<i>as any to return to where we left off.</i>

52:47.625 --> 52:49.833
<i>Yeah, yeah. Laugh all you want.</i>

52:51.666 --> 52:53.125
<i>But here's what they told me…</i>

52:54.041 --> 52:56.625
Good job, Stan. You didn't pass out.

52:58.541 --> 52:59.875
Don't worry about the vomit.

52:59.958 --> 53:03.416
Every astronaut, from John Glenn
to Neil Armstrong, they all upchuck.

53:03.500 --> 53:04.625
At least the first time.

53:06.041 --> 53:08.708
<i>So while my childhood</i>
<i>had been fairly normal,</i>

53:08.791 --> 53:11.083
<i>my time at NASA sure as hell wasn't.</i>

53:11.166 --> 53:14.083
<i>I found myself in some intense training.</i>

53:14.166 --> 53:16.791
<i>This one was actually called</i>
<i>the Vomit Comet.</i>

53:24.166 --> 53:26.291
<i>I kind of loved 1/6th gravity,</i>

53:26.375 --> 53:29.416
<i>but it was like learning to move around</i>
<i>with a whole new body.</i>

53:29.500 --> 53:33.875
<i>And there was lots of classwork.</i>
<i>Not very exciting but necessary, I guess.</i>

53:34.916 --> 53:37.375
<i>Underwater training</i>
<i>had been invented by Buzz Aldrin</i>

53:37.458 --> 53:39.500
<i>after the failed Gemini space walk.</i>

53:40.000 --> 53:41.208
<i>It was pretty scary.</i>

53:49.583 --> 53:52.666
<i>And they had all kinds</i>
<i>of survival scenarios to think about,</i>

53:52.750 --> 53:55.333
<i>train in, and plan for just in case,</i>

53:55.916 --> 53:58.916
<i>from gettin' stranded in a jungle</i>
<i>to havin' to tromp through a desert.</i>

54:00.166 --> 54:04.041
<i>You had to be able to make clothes</i>
<i>and protective cover from your parachute.</i>

54:06.125 --> 54:08.458
<i>I remember thinkin'</i>
<i>that if this ended up my fate,</i>

54:08.958 --> 54:13.500
<i>it would be the least of my problems,</i>
<i>like one of those </i>Twilight Zone <i>episodes.</i>

54:16.625 --> 54:19.458
<i>After I finished training,</i>
<i>they put me through a crash course…</i>

54:20.041 --> 54:22.333
<i>Probably not the best term for it,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

54:22.833 --> 54:25.750
<i>…on how to fly all aspects</i>
<i>of what was now secretly being called</i>

54:25.833 --> 54:27.708
<i>Apollo 10 1/2.</i>

54:28.208 --> 54:31.666
<i>First, I had to learn every control,</i>
<i>even while blindfolded.</i>

54:31.750 --> 54:34.416
-Altitude?

54:35.958 --> 54:38.125
-Check.
-Event timer?

54:38.208 --> 54:39.958
-<i>Check.</i>
Temp in?

54:41.291 --> 54:42.125
Check.

54:43.166 --> 54:44.708
<i>Simulation was one thing,</i>

54:44.791 --> 54:49.000
<i>but to see what it felt like</i>
<i>to actually land a craft in 1/6th gravity,</i>

54:49.083 --> 54:50.500
<i>they created this monster.</i>

54:50.583 --> 54:53.375
<i>The Lunar Landing Training Vehicle,</i>

54:53.458 --> 54:55.041
<i>or LLTV.</i>

54:55.125 --> 54:56.166
[engine roaring[

55:06.000 --> 55:08.958
<i>Neil Armstrong had almost died</i>
<i>tryin' to land this thing.</i>

55:09.041 --> 55:12.250
<i>He bailed out just seconds</i>
<i>before it crashed and exploded,</i>

55:12.333 --> 55:14.916
<i>and he went to lunch</i>
<i>like nothing had happened.</i>

55:15.000 --> 55:18.750
<i>That was Neil.</i>
<i>Always cool as a cucumber.</i>

55:19.583 --> 55:21.833
<i>After you learned</i>
<i>everything about the ship,</i>

55:21.916 --> 55:23.833
<i>it was time for integrated simulation.</i>

55:26.083 --> 55:29.166
<i>Kranz, Bostick, and everybody</i>
<i>was at the mission control,</i>

55:29.250 --> 55:30.833
<i>I was in the simulator,</i>

55:31.375 --> 55:34.416
<i>and we were all being tested</i>
<i>by the simulation supervisors.</i>

55:35.291 --> 55:37.416
<i>These ominous voices</i>
<i>behind a two-way mirror.</i>

55:37.500 --> 55:39.333
Leak started in CSM propulsion.

55:39.416 --> 55:43.083
S-IVB engine shut down
during abort mode, overlap.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.250
<i>They were known</i>
<i>as "sim sups" for short.</i>

55:45.333 --> 55:47.958
<i>They'd sit behind their dark window</i>
<i>at mission control</i>

55:48.041 --> 55:51.291
<i>and come up with the most diabolical</i>
<i>scenarios you could imagine,</i>

55:52.416 --> 55:55.541
<i>so that no matter what happened</i>
<i>out there in space, you'd be ready.</i>

55:56.125 --> 55:59.708
<i>I heard, during the Gemini program,</i>
<i>they had a controller fake a heart attack</i>

55:59.791 --> 56:01.666
<i>to see how everyone would respond.</i>

56:02.541 --> 56:04.375
<i>Everyone pretty much hated him.</i>

56:04.458 --> 56:05.791
Okay, last simulation.

56:05.875 --> 56:09.166
Let's knock this out,
land safely, and call it a day,

56:09.250 --> 56:11.875
hopefully in time for some beers
at the Singing Wheel.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.375
Well, Coke for you, Stan.

56:13.958 --> 56:15.416
Tang's good for me, Flight.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.541
All right. You are a go for power descent.

56:18.625 --> 56:21.083
Okay. Engine start. 10% thrust.

56:21.791 --> 56:22.666
<i>Lookin' good.</i>

56:23.250 --> 56:24.875
You are go for full throttle.

56:24.958 --> 56:26.333
Full throttle.

56:26.416 --> 56:27.708
Thousand feet.

56:31.583 --> 56:34.958
Getting a 1201 program alarm.

56:36.041 --> 56:38.833
-1201? Bales, what the hell is that?
-Hold on.

56:39.583 --> 56:40.791
<i>750 feet.</i>

56:40.875 --> 56:43.125
"Computer overload.
Can't complete all tasks."

56:43.208 --> 56:44.958
All systems seem in order.

56:45.541 --> 56:46.833
Jack, what's goin' on here?

56:47.583 --> 56:50.166
It's a bailout alarm. The computer's
overloaded for some reason.

56:51.708 --> 56:54.000
500 feet. Looks fine on my end.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.666
<i>400 feet.</i>

56:55.750 --> 56:56.583
<i>Wait!</i>

56:56.666 --> 56:58.541
1202 alarm!

56:58.625 --> 57:00.000
1202?

57:00.083 --> 57:02.708
I-- I can't see a thing wrong,
but this isn't good.

57:02.791 --> 57:04.166
I-- I think it's time to abort.

57:05.416 --> 57:07.875
Flight guidance, something's wrong
with the computer. Abort.

57:08.791 --> 57:10.166
Are we gonna abort flight?

57:11.625 --> 57:13.708
-Flight abort.
-Darn it! Abort!

57:17.416 --> 57:18.916
This was not an abort!

57:19.000 --> 57:21.291
<i>-If you'd read the manual thoroughly,</i>

57:21.375 --> 57:23.541
<i>you would have known</i>
<i>to continue on the landing.</i>

57:23.625 --> 57:25.416
Instead, we now have astronauts

57:25.500 --> 57:28.041
comin' back to Earth
with their tail between their legs,

57:28.125 --> 57:30.208
a billion tax dollars wasted,

57:30.291 --> 57:32.500
and front-row seats watching the Russians

57:32.583 --> 57:34.958
plant their flags up there in August!

57:37.666 --> 57:38.500
You happy?

57:43.291 --> 57:45.875
<i>By the time I was really up there,</i>
<i>ready for liftoff,</i>

57:45.958 --> 57:49.208
<i>I was actually very calm,</i>
<i>because I felt I had already done it.</i>

57:49.708 --> 57:51.583
<i>They had whipped me into fighting shape.</i>

57:52.083 --> 57:54.250
<i>I remember</i>
<i>bein' more excited than nervous.</i>

57:54.750 --> 57:56.166
<i>Maybe too calm, come to think of it.</i>

57:56.250 --> 57:57.333
Stan, are you ready?

57:57.833 --> 57:58.833
Ready.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.583
<i>So it was off to the moon and back.</i>

58:05.666 --> 58:09.458
<i>We carried out Apollo 10 1/2's</i>
<i>secret mission without a hitch.</i>

58:09.958 --> 58:12.250
<i>But then it was like it never happened.</i>

58:12.333 --> 58:14.666
<i>No headlines.</i>
<i>No ticker-tape parade for me.</i>

58:15.250 --> 58:17.541
<i>I couldn't tell anyone, even my family.</i>

58:18.583 --> 58:23.208
<i>When Apollo 11 launched on July 16th</i>
<i>and landed on the moon four days later,</i>

58:23.291 --> 58:26.083
<i>I was watching it on TV</i>
<i>like everyone else around the world.</i>

58:27.083 --> 58:29.500
<i>But to me,</i>
<i>it felt like it was some kind of dream.</i>

58:30.000 --> 58:33.833
<i>I was the only person on Earth who knew</i>
<i>exactly what they were experiencing.</i>

58:33.916 --> 58:35.625
<i>It was like I was up there with them.</i>

58:36.875 --> 58:37.791
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

58:39.041 --> 58:40.041
<i>I was here.</i>

58:42.916 --> 58:44.708
You see the Saturn V right there?

58:44.791 --> 58:47.833
They put it on a barge in Huntsville,
Alabama, where they built it.

58:47.916 --> 58:51.250
Then it goes up to Tennessee and Ohio,
then shoots on down the Mississippi.

58:51.333 --> 58:54.458
Goes across the Gulf of Mexico,
rounding the tip of Florida,

58:54.541 --> 58:56.416
then they drop it off at Cape Kennedy.

58:56.500 --> 59:00.500
Now, of course, if it was to come here,
you'll wanna take a right at the Gulf,

59:00.583 --> 59:03.708
then it's pretty much
Galveston Bay, then Clear Lake,

59:03.791 --> 59:07.250
and then we could walk across
NASA Road 1 and pick it up from there.

59:07.333 --> 59:09.625
<i>…check of all the systems</i>
<i>aboard the spacecraft…</i>

59:09.708 --> 59:11.958
-And you're in charge of all that?
<i>-…ready to go…</i>

59:12.041 --> 59:14.666
If that's not shipping and receiving,
I don't know what is.

59:14.750 --> 59:18.708
<i>…Eastern time.</i>
<i>That huge, 36-story-high launch vehicle…</i>

59:18.791 --> 59:21.541
But, no, Kyle in Florida
takes care of most of the details.

59:21.625 --> 59:26.208
<i>T-minus 34 minutes and counting,</i>
<i>with everything going well.</i>

59:26.291 --> 59:28.916
<i>Astronauts fit as a fiddle,</i>
<i>according to the report,</i>

59:29.000 --> 59:33.166
<i>as they wait there</i>
<i>for the launch of Apollo 11.</i>

59:33.250 --> 59:34.583
<i>The spacecraft systems</i>

59:34.666 --> 59:37.375
<i>are checking out perfectly</i>
<i>in these final checkouts.</i>

59:37.458 --> 59:39.625
<i>The weather is good,</i>

59:39.708 --> 59:42.416
<i>and it seems</i>
<i>that man will get off this morning</i>

59:42.500 --> 59:46.208
<i>in this great adventure</i>
<i>to land finally on the moon…</i>

59:46.291 --> 59:47.500
Are you nervous at all?

59:47.583 --> 59:50.208
No, not really.
Why would Dad be nervous?

59:50.291 --> 59:51.125
I'm not!

59:51.208 --> 59:54.916
Well, hon, your dad is a part of this too.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.750
So many people are.

59:57.250 --> 1:00:01.916
<i>…we really don't have a language</i>
<i>to… to describe this thing.</i>

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.375
<i>Uh, how do you say, uh…</i>
<i>"high as the sky" anymore?</i>

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:08.416
<i>"The sky's the limit."</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:11.875
<i>Does the moon</i>
<i>seem strange and far away to you?</i>

1:00:11.958 --> 1:00:14.750
<i>No, not really.</i>
<i>There's things further out than the moon.</i>

1:00:14.833 --> 1:00:17.333
<i>And is it true</i>
<i>that the young people…</i>

1:00:17.416 --> 1:00:20.333
<i>So now, of course,</i>
<i>I'm thinking about the next thing.</i>

1:00:20.416 --> 1:00:22.000
<i>Mars and beyond.</i>

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:26.125
<i>You're thinking of Mars and beyond?</i>
<i>We haven't gotten to the moon yet, Arthur!</i>

1:00:26.208 --> 1:00:29.833
<i>That's the nature</i>
<i>of you science-fiction writers, I suppose.</i>

1:00:29.916 --> 1:00:31.666
<i>We'll find some surprises on the moon.</i>

1:00:31.750 --> 1:00:34.791
<i>Not necessarily on this first flight,</i>
<i>but I'm sure eventually.</i>

1:00:35.250 --> 1:00:38.416
<i>I don't know if they'll find a large</i>
<i>black monolith waiting for us on the moon.</i>

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:41.333
<i>A reference to </i>2001…

1:00:41.416 --> 1:00:43.958
-Would you like to--
-Stan! Get in here! It's about to launch!

1:00:50.875 --> 1:00:54.416
<i>Well, the, uh, engines</i>
<i>that generate that thrust</i>

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:59.750
<i>have a combined horsepower</i>
<i>equal to 543 jet fighter planes.</i>

1:00:59.833 --> 1:01:04.625
<i>They burn 5,662,000 pounds of fuel,</i>

1:01:04.708 --> 1:01:07.500
<i>the equivalent of 98 railroad tank cars,</i>

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:11.166
<i>the capacity of a small town's water tank.</i>

1:01:11.875 --> 1:01:17.625
<i>Their launch vehicle there weighs</i>
<i>as much as the submarine Nautilus.</i>

1:01:18.291 --> 1:01:21.791
<i>Liftoff, the noise reaches 120 decibels</i>
<i>and has been compared</i>

1:01:21.875 --> 1:01:25.041
<i>to eight million hi-fi sets</i>
<i>playing at once.</i>

1:01:42.416 --> 1:01:44.708
Controllers,
we need a go-no-go for launch.

1:01:44.791 --> 1:01:46.125
-<i>Go, flight controllers.</i>
-Go.

1:01:46.208 --> 1:01:47.333
<i>-Okay. Retro.</i>
-Go.

1:01:47.416 --> 1:01:48.458
<i>-FIDO. Guidance.</i>
-Go.

1:01:48.541 --> 1:01:49.458
<i>-Go.</i>
<i>-Control.</i>

1:01:49.541 --> 1:01:50.625
<i>-Go.</i>
<i>-Telcom.</i>

1:01:50.708 --> 1:01:51.958
<i>-GNC.</i>

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:53.125
<i>-Eecom. Surgeon.</i>
<i>-Go.</i>

1:01:53.208 --> 1:01:55.166
<i>CapCom, we're go to continue.</i>

1:01:55.250 --> 1:01:57.041
T-minus 60 seconds and counting.

1:01:59.375 --> 1:02:00.750
<i>All right, 64-zero-five.</i>

1:02:00.833 --> 1:02:04.833
<i>As tonight's report, it feels good.</i>
<i>T-minus 25 seconds.</i>

1:02:06.666 --> 1:02:09.291
-Move! Your head's in the way.
<i>-20 seconds and counting.</i>

1:02:09.375 --> 1:02:10.583
Yeah, come on.

1:02:11.083 --> 1:02:12.666
<i>T-minus 15 seconds.</i>

1:02:12.750 --> 1:02:14.708
<i>-Guidance is internal.</i>
-A little lower.

1:02:14.791 --> 1:02:16.375
<i>Twelve. Eleven.</i>

1:02:16.458 --> 1:02:20.583
<i>Ten. Nine. Ignition sequence start.</i>

1:02:20.666 --> 1:02:22.791
<i>Six. Five.</i>

1:02:22.875 --> 1:02:24.583
<i>Four. Three.</i>

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:26.583
<i>Two. One.</i>

1:02:26.666 --> 1:02:28.916
<i>Zero. All engine running.</i>

1:02:29.416 --> 1:02:30.375
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1:02:30.458 --> 1:02:31.916
<i>We have a liftoff.</i>

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:55.625
<i>The program, of which Apollo 11…</i>

1:02:55.708 --> 1:02:57.291
<i>Buildings shaking.</i>

1:02:57.791 --> 1:03:00.333
<i>We're getting that buffeting</i>
<i>we've become used to.</i>

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:05.375
<i>What a moment. Man on the way to the moon.</i>

1:03:09.750 --> 1:03:11.666
It's looking good, Flight.
Right down the middle.

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:13.416
<i>Flight, they all look good.</i>

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:24.375
<i>Looks like a good trajectory</i>
<i>so far, doesn't it, Wally?</i>

1:03:24.458 --> 1:03:25.916
Very <i>good. Very good.</i>

1:03:29.208 --> 1:03:31.250
Downrange one mile.

1:03:32.166 --> 1:03:35.125
-Three, four miles.
-<i>…it's confirmed…</i>

1:03:35.208 --> 1:03:37.500
2,195 feet per second.

1:03:38.166 --> 1:03:39.791
<i>Everything fell into place.</i>

1:03:39.875 --> 1:03:41.958
-<i>Still see it?</i>
-<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

1:03:44.625 --> 1:03:45.875
-Okay.

1:03:45.958 --> 1:03:47.250
First separation, get ready.

1:03:47.333 --> 1:03:48.958
<i>Bird, you're looking good.</i>

1:03:58.375 --> 1:04:02.000
<i>But you know what? This terrific</i>
<i>bikini was made by a paper company.</i>

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:04.500
<i>Confil's fantastic!</i>

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.291
<i>It is like paper in one way.</i>
<i>So cheap, you can just throw it away.</i>

1:04:09.375 --> 1:04:10.583
-<i>Confil.</i>

1:04:10.666 --> 1:04:12.875
Well, on that note…

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:15.625
…I've got things to do.

1:04:16.375 --> 1:04:18.666
<i>This is the coffee.</i>

1:04:20.583 --> 1:04:22.541
<i>It doesn't care that it looks different.</i>

1:04:23.833 --> 1:04:25.333
<i>It's the way coffee is--</i>

1:04:26.750 --> 1:04:29.958
<i>This is Jethro Bodine calling space people</i>
<i>by mental telepathy.</i>

1:04:30.458 --> 1:04:32.458
<i>You're probably lookin'</i>
<i>for a big Earth brain</i>

1:04:32.541 --> 1:04:34.708
<i>to take back to Venus or Mars or wherever…</i>

1:04:37.625 --> 1:04:39.166
<i>They must be Martians!</i>

1:04:39.250 --> 1:04:40.583
<i>-Eh, </i>cosi, cosa.

1:04:41.375 --> 1:04:43.416
-<i>What are they saying?</i>
-Okay. Wait a sec.

1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.833
What is this crap? Jethro!

1:04:46.958 --> 1:04:48.416
Where is the coverage?

1:04:49.875 --> 1:04:53.375
-<i>This third stage…</i>
-Come on. It's a historic day.

1:04:53.458 --> 1:04:56.458
<i>…five minutes and 47 seconds</i>
<i>to increase their speed…</i>

1:04:56.541 --> 1:04:58.291
Historically boring day.

1:04:58.375 --> 1:05:01.041
-Pardon?
<i>-…put them on the way to the moon.</i>

1:05:01.125 --> 1:05:01.958
Nothing.

1:05:02.041 --> 1:05:03.916
<i>26,000 feet per second.</i>

1:05:05.791 --> 1:05:08.125
<i>-Burn is going well.</i>

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:11.583
<i>Ignition came right at the moment</i>
<i>when it was expected to.</i>

1:05:13.166 --> 1:05:16.125
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>the full thrust has been monitored.</i>

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:19.041
<i>Telemetry and radar tracking both solid.</i>

1:05:19.666 --> 1:05:22.291
Velocity now exceeds
35,000 feet per second.

1:05:22.375 --> 1:05:24.916
Altitude, one, seven, seven
nautical miles.

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:27.958
<i>You are now out of orbit, Stan.</i>

1:05:34.791 --> 1:05:37.791
<i>Seem to have trouble</i>
<i>raising the Apollo at the moment.</i>

1:05:39.958 --> 1:05:43.875
<i>So an engine cutoff, they confirmed.</i>
<i>We haven't heard from the spacecraft.</i>

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:53.291
<i>These minutes give us great concern.</i>

1:05:54.083 --> 1:05:56.583
-Apollo 10 1/2, this is Houston.

1:05:56.666 --> 1:05:57.625
Do you read?

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:05.916
<i>Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 10 1/2.</i>

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:08.208
-That was a magnificent ride.

1:06:08.291 --> 1:06:10.750
<i>Roger, Apollo 10 1/2.</i>
<i>We'll pass that on.</i>

1:06:10.833 --> 1:06:13.625
And it looks like
you are well on your way.

1:06:21.875 --> 1:06:24.708
<i>And that was</i>
<i>the beginning of my trip to the moon.</i>

1:06:25.208 --> 1:06:28.041
<i>Even though I was movin'</i>
<i>at 7,500 miles per hour…</i>

1:06:28.125 --> 1:06:32.666
<i>…it sure felt to me like</i>
<i>three and a half very long travel days.</i>

1:06:40.291 --> 1:06:42.291
Three. Two…

1:06:42.375 --> 1:06:44.916
<i>The coverage continued</i>
<i>on the TV, of course,</i>

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.458
<i>and the growing anticipation</i>

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:49.166
<i>of what was going to happen</i>
<i>in a few days was ever present.</i>

1:06:49.250 --> 1:06:50.125
Not this time!

1:06:50.208 --> 1:06:53.041
<i>But a few days flyin' to the moon</i>
<i>is a long time.</i>

1:06:53.625 --> 1:06:57.041
<i>-And it was summer.</i>
-<i>Dark Shadows </i>is starting without us!

1:06:57.125 --> 1:06:58.625
All right! Bye, guys!

1:06:58.708 --> 1:07:00.416
Bye. Tomorrow.

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.375
<i>-That night we went to the drive-in.</i>

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:06.875
-Hi.
<i>-Deploying Dad's money-saving scheme.</i>

1:07:06.958 --> 1:07:08.833
Four adults. And then two of them…

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:11.875
are children that are under 12,

1:07:11.958 --> 1:07:14.625
so if they're under 12,
that's, you know, free.

1:07:15.208 --> 1:07:17.791
Okay. That's $6.

1:07:18.583 --> 1:07:19.916
You better believe it is.

1:07:26.333 --> 1:07:27.958
-Come on!

1:07:29.666 --> 1:07:30.541
Quick!

1:07:30.625 --> 1:07:31.916
Come up!

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.583
-Oh jeez!
-Sh, sh!

1:07:35.208 --> 1:07:36.708
-I'm in!

1:07:38.708 --> 1:07:42.125
-We wanna see <i>Hellfighters!</i>
-No. No movie with the word "hell".

1:07:42.208 --> 1:07:45.916
-It's filmed in Houston with John Wayne!
-I want <i>Swiss Family Robinson!</i>

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:49.083
You can stay here
and watch <i>Swiss Family Robinson.</i>

1:07:49.583 --> 1:07:51.083
We're going to see<i> Hellfighters.</i>

1:07:51.166 --> 1:07:53.166
-Okay, fine.
-All right, fine.

1:07:53.250 --> 1:07:56.750
The car will stay on the <i>Shakiest Gun</i>
<i>in the West, Swiss Family Robinson</i> side.

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:58.250
Just get back when it's over!

1:07:58.333 --> 1:07:59.500
-Yes, Dad!
-Okay!

1:07:59.583 --> 1:08:02.791
-What did he just say?
-Get back when it's over!

1:08:02.875 --> 1:08:05.208
-Thank you.

1:08:05.291 --> 1:08:08.625
Hold on. Settle in.

1:08:08.708 --> 1:08:12.041
Oh yeah. That's real nice.

1:08:15.666 --> 1:08:18.166
<i>It was always fun</i>
<i>to just roam around.</i>

1:08:18.250 --> 1:08:20.666
<i>We'd go lookin' for couples</i>
<i>makin' out in their cars.</i>

1:08:21.333 --> 1:08:24.333
<i>The best giveaway was a car</i>
<i>that's brake light was goin' on and off.</i>

1:08:24.416 --> 1:08:26.791
<i>…section of drill pipe</i>
<i>you see sticking out of the hole</i>

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:30.458
<i>has to be cut off right at the well head</i>
<i>before they can move in with the nitro.</i>

1:08:30.541 --> 1:08:32.250
<i>It's spreading the flame…</i>

1:08:33.625 --> 1:08:36.125
<i>This was the last phase</i>
<i>of childhood where I experienced</i>

1:08:36.208 --> 1:08:39.125
<i>that special comfort</i>
<i>of falling asleep in the car.</i>

1:08:41.750 --> 1:08:44.708
<i>You could drift off,</i>
<i>knowing everything was going to be fine.</i>

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:47.666
<i>And you'd wake up the next morning</i>
<i>in your bed.</i>

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:51.500
<i>In space, it was a little more lonely.</i>

1:08:57.250 --> 1:09:00.250
<i>The next day, we all went to the beach</i>
<i>in our friend's pickup.</i>

1:09:00.333 --> 1:09:02.125
<i>It was about a one-hour drive.</i>

1:09:07.083 --> 1:09:10.750
<i>Galveston, oh, Galveston.</i>
<i>It was the only beach we knew.</i>

1:09:14.958 --> 1:09:18.958
<i>But it was always so fun.</i>
<i>Cars and gritty hot dogs be damned!</i>

1:09:22.708 --> 1:09:26.583
<i>And just by goin' in the water, we were,</i>
<i>to some degree, risking our lives</i>

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:30.541
<i>because there was an undertow</i>
<i>that would gladly pull you underwater</i>

1:09:30.625 --> 1:09:33.000
<i>and kick you out somewhere in Louisiana.</i>

1:09:33.666 --> 1:09:34.750
<i>If that didn't get you,</i>

1:09:34.833 --> 1:09:38.041
<i>there were jellyfish floatin' around</i>
<i>everywhere, ready to sting you,</i>

1:09:38.125 --> 1:09:41.583
<i>and barnacles on the random posts</i>
<i>sticking out of the water,</i>

1:09:41.666 --> 1:09:43.291
<i>ready to rip you to shreds.</i>

1:09:44.166 --> 1:09:46.291
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>there was always an oil spill</i>

1:09:46.375 --> 1:09:50.625
<i>somewhere out in the Gulf of Mexico,</i>
<i>resulting in little tar balls everywhere.</i>

1:09:51.125 --> 1:09:52.208
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

1:09:52.291 --> 1:09:55.333
<i>we'd scrub our tar-blackened feet clean</i>
<i>with gasoline.</i>

1:09:55.416 --> 1:09:58.250
<i>And during these days,</i>
<i>because of the moon mission,</i>

1:09:58.333 --> 1:10:01.541
<i>-the TV was full of classic sci-fi movies.</i>

1:10:01.625 --> 1:10:02.541
<i>The most memorable</i>

1:10:02.625 --> 1:10:07.083
<i>was maybe the 1950 version</i>
<i>of Robert Heinlein's </i>Destination Moon

1:10:07.166 --> 1:10:09.208
<i>which predicted nearly 20 years in advance</i>

1:10:09.291 --> 1:10:12.208
<i>so much of what would actually happen</i>
<i>in 1969.</i>

1:10:13.291 --> 1:10:15.666
<i>It's amazing everything it got right.</i>

1:10:15.750 --> 1:10:17.416
<i>The initial failed launch.</i>

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:20.333
<i>A Texan demanding it all be built here.</i>

1:10:20.416 --> 1:10:23.333
<i>Well, all I gotta say is</i>
<i>we'd better build it in Texas.</i>

1:10:23.416 --> 1:10:24.625
<i>G-forces.</i>

1:10:24.708 --> 1:10:25.833
<i>Weightlessness.</i>

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:27.875
<i>Looking back at Earth.</i>

1:10:29.958 --> 1:10:32.541
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What--
-What are you doing?

1:10:32.625 --> 1:10:34.666
-Janis Joplin's on <i>Dick Cavett.</i>
-<i>…was all over…</i>

1:10:34.750 --> 1:10:37.333
-<i>No, uh…</i>
-Yeah, the movie's not even over yet.

1:10:37.416 --> 1:10:39.916
The boys have dominated the TV all night.
It's our turn.

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.916
<i>May I light your fire, my child?</i>

1:10:44.208 --> 1:10:46.958
<i>That's my favorite singer. How'd you know?</i>

1:10:48.208 --> 1:10:49.791
<i>-I guess not.</i>
<i>-Apparently not, no.</i>

1:10:50.875 --> 1:10:52.833
<i>Well, I would have bet against it myself…</i>

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:54.291
Oof! Stan!

1:10:54.375 --> 1:10:55.625
-Get off!
-No!

1:10:55.708 --> 1:10:58.250
<i>-To get down and really get into music…</i>
-No, no. Stop it!

1:10:58.333 --> 1:10:59.833
<i>-…get on the bottom floor of music…</i>
-No!

1:10:59.916 --> 1:11:02.583
<i>…instead of fiddling on the top</i>
<i>like most chick singers do.</i>

1:11:02.666 --> 1:11:05.833
<i>I think they…</i>
<i>…on the top of the melody</i>

1:11:05.916 --> 1:11:08.333
<i>instead of getting into the feeling</i>
<i>of the music, I don't know.</i>

1:11:09.166 --> 1:11:11.458
<i>-That's a good enough answer for me.</i>

1:11:11.541 --> 1:11:13.250
<i>We spent a good part</i>
<i>of the next day,</i>

1:11:13.333 --> 1:11:15.500
<i>like so many other hot summer days,</i>

1:11:15.583 --> 1:11:16.791
<i>just hangin' out at the pool.</i>

1:11:17.416 --> 1:11:19.416
<i>We all had our diving board specialties.</i>

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.625
<i>I had perfected the jackknife,</i>

1:11:21.708 --> 1:11:24.875
<i>the cannonball,</i>
<i>and the lesser-known preacher's seat.</i>

1:11:26.666 --> 1:11:29.291
<i>Greg was good at creating</i>
<i>some dives of his own.</i>

1:11:31.625 --> 1:11:35.125
<i>But the highlight was probably</i>
<i>gettin' to have a Frito pie for lunch,</i>

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:38.458
<i>which was just a bag of Fritos</i>
<i>with the side split open</i>

1:11:38.541 --> 1:11:40.083
<i>and a bunch of chili mixed in.</i>

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:06.208
<i>By the time I entered lunar orbit,</i>

1:12:06.291 --> 1:12:09.625
<i>I was traveling at 2,287 miles per hour</i>

1:12:10.291 --> 1:12:13.250
<i>and around a celestial body</i>
<i>that's never had an Earthling on it.</i>

1:12:14.875 --> 1:12:18.291
<i>I looked down as I was passing over</i>
<i>the Sea of Tranquility.</i>

1:12:18.875 --> 1:12:21.166
<i>It didn't look too tranquil to me.</i>

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:23.666
<i>Where in the world was I gonna land?</i>

1:12:24.708 --> 1:12:26.083
<i>Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.</i>

1:12:27.250 --> 1:12:29.291
<i>When we got home</i>
<i>from the pool that night,</i>

1:12:29.375 --> 1:12:31.458
<i>we all watched </i>The Johnny Cash Show.

1:12:31.541 --> 1:12:33.500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the Monkees!</i>

1:12:34.708 --> 1:12:36.291
-It's them, it's really them!
-Oh my gosh!

1:12:36.375 --> 1:12:37.625
Davy is so cute!

1:12:37.708 --> 1:12:39.791
<i>We'd rushed home</i>
<i>because Stephanie and Jana said</i>

1:12:39.875 --> 1:12:42.458
<i>-the Monkees were gonna be on.</i>

1:12:44.166 --> 1:12:47.208
<i>There was Micky, Davy, and Mike,</i>
<i>but where was Peter?</i>

1:12:51.333 --> 1:12:53.708
<i>And then later,</i>
<i>there was Joni Mitchell</i>

1:12:53.791 --> 1:12:55.416
<i>singin' a duet with Johnny.</i>

1:13:02.291 --> 1:13:05.708
-She has the most interesting voice.

1:13:05.791 --> 1:13:08.500
She's such a versatile artist.
She's a painter too.

1:13:20.541 --> 1:13:24.625
<i>Then the big day came.</i>
<i>July 20th, 1969.</i>

1:13:25.708 --> 1:13:28.458
<i>They were going to land on the moon</i>
<i>some time in the afternoon</i>

1:13:28.541 --> 1:13:30.625
<i>and walk on it in the evening.</i>

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:33.083
<i>But Dad had a surprise option for us.</i>

1:13:33.166 --> 1:13:34.541
Okay. We've been given

1:13:34.625 --> 1:13:36.583
-some discounted tickets to AstroWorld.

1:13:36.666 --> 1:13:38.291
-But they're only good for today.

1:13:38.375 --> 1:13:40.291
So you can go, obviously,

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:44.750
or you can stay here with us and watch
the news coverage of the moon landing.

1:13:44.833 --> 1:13:46.208
AstroWorld!

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:49.000
But won't we miss the landing?

1:13:49.083 --> 1:13:52.375
No, they're not scheduled to walk
until later today, so you'll be home.

1:13:52.458 --> 1:13:55.125
-Yes!
-I'll tell you what. Let's vote.

1:13:55.208 --> 1:13:57.875
-Vicky, what's your day lookin' like?
-I'm working till five.

1:13:58.875 --> 1:14:00.916
-Steve?
-I have a couple of yards.

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000
Of course.

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:04.208
And you four?

1:14:04.708 --> 1:14:07.750
-Who's up for some AstroWorld?
-Yeah!

1:14:08.583 --> 1:14:11.208
<i>No one could pass up a trip</i>
<i>to AstroWorld.</i>

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:12.708
<i>It was the greatest place of all.</i>

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:17.500
<i>It was a huge amusement park right across</i>
<i>the freeway from the Astrodome,</i>

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.916
<i>and Houston's version of Disneyland.</i>

1:14:20.416 --> 1:14:23.166
<i>A place of non-stop adventure</i>
<i>and excitement.</i>

1:14:23.833 --> 1:14:26.750
<i>Seemed like everything was "Astro."</i>
<i>The Astro Wheel.</i>

1:14:28.708 --> 1:14:29.875
<i>The Astro Needle.</i>

1:14:30.708 --> 1:14:31.750
<i>Astro Way.</i>

1:14:32.666 --> 1:14:34.208
<i>Then there was the Black Dragon.</i>

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:36.666
<i>The Bamboo Chute.</i>

1:14:37.333 --> 1:14:39.041
<i>And the Spin Out car ride.</i>

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.083
<i>The Lost World jungle boat ride</i>
<i>featured alligators</i>

1:14:43.166 --> 1:14:45.333
<i>and restless natives firing arrows at you.</i>

1:14:46.458 --> 1:14:50.416
<i>Our usual strategy was to get there early,</i>
<i>right when the gates opened,</i>

1:14:50.916 --> 1:14:54.416
<i>and then sprint to the Alpine sleigh ride</i>
<i>near the back of the park.</i>

1:14:55.333 --> 1:14:57.458
<i>It was by far the most popular ride.</i>

1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:01.500
<i>Maybe you could ride it a</i>
<i>few times real quick</i>

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:05.583
<i>before the line started gettin' too long</i>
<i>and there'd be a 45-minute wait.</i>

1:15:07.291 --> 1:15:09.166
<i>The ride was exhilarating.</i>

1:15:11.375 --> 1:15:12.875
<i>There was a big waterfall.</i>

1:15:16.666 --> 1:15:17.833
<i>An avalanche room.</i>

1:15:20.958 --> 1:15:22.083
<i>An echo tunnel</i>

1:15:22.166 --> 1:15:25.583
<i>where what you yelled out in one place,</i>
<i>you'd hear again in the next cave.</i>

1:15:25.666 --> 1:15:28.375
-Hello to the future!
-Davy Jones forever!

1:15:28.458 --> 1:15:29.791
Miss you!

1:15:33.250 --> 1:15:34.541
<i>Hello to the future!</i>

1:15:34.625 --> 1:15:36.041
<i>Davy Jones forever!</i>

1:15:36.125 --> 1:15:37.625
<i>Miss you!</i>

1:15:40.666 --> 1:15:43.208
<i>And it all led up</i>
<i>to this crazy finale.</i>

1:15:43.291 --> 1:15:45.541
<i>You'd be goin' along all pleasant-like,</i>

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:49.250
<i>then you'd come around a corner,</i>
<i>the car would slow down,</i>

1:15:49.333 --> 1:15:50.875
<i>and you'd realize you were headin'</i>

1:15:50.958 --> 1:15:55.166
<i>into a dark, foreboding mine shaft-lookin'</i>
<i>opening in the side of the mountain.</i>

1:16:06.958 --> 1:16:09.666
<i>And just when you thought</i>
<i>things had returned to normal…</i>

1:16:17.791 --> 1:16:21.083
<i>The Abominable Snowman</i>
<i>was probably some college drama student.</i>

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:24.333
<i>One time,</i>
<i>we even caught him takin' a smoke break.</i>

1:16:26.416 --> 1:16:27.250
Faker!

1:16:27.333 --> 1:16:29.041
-Grr!

1:16:41.041 --> 1:16:44.750
<i>We'll be going off air</i>
<i>shortly, and we'll pick you up for sure.</i>

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.166
<i>It's 40 minutes</i>
<i>before the landing on the moon,</i>

1:16:52.250 --> 1:16:56.083
<i>and it is now nine minutes</i>
<i>before we should begin to hear</i>

1:16:56.166 --> 1:16:59.625
<i>from the command module</i>
<i>coming around on this pass,</i>

1:16:59.708 --> 1:17:02.666
<i>the 14th revolution of the moon.</i>

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:06.833
<i>This landing</i>
<i>is not just as simple as… as it sounds.</i>

1:17:06.916 --> 1:17:09.333
<i>They've got to come in</i>
<i>over some rather high features</i>

1:17:09.416 --> 1:17:14.000
<i>before they make that set down</i>
<i>on a fairly flat point in the moon.</i>

1:17:14.083 --> 1:17:18.000
<i>The hard part is to get that close</i>
<i>and then have to commit to leaving,</i>

1:17:18.083 --> 1:17:19.083
<i>after all this work.</i>

1:17:19.166 --> 1:17:20.583
<i>I think that pressure is probably</i>

1:17:20.666 --> 1:17:23.291
<i>the greatest amount of pressure</i>
<i>any crew will ever have.</i>

1:17:23.375 --> 1:17:25.958
<i>-They roll now to the windows up position.</i>

1:17:26.041 --> 1:17:28.041
<i>Our position downrange…</i>

1:17:36.708 --> 1:17:38.583
We gotta be a go
before we start this burn.

1:17:38.666 --> 1:17:40.916
<i>-Go/no go for a lower descent. Retro.</i>
-Go!

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.041
<i>-FIDO. Guidance.</i>
<i>-Go.</i>

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:42.958
<i>-Control.</i>
-Go.

1:17:43.041 --> 1:17:44.041
<i>-Telcom.</i>
<i>-Go.</i>

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:44.958
<i>-GNC.</i>
-Go.

1:17:45.041 --> 1:17:46.083
<i>-Eecom.</i>
Go.

1:17:46.833 --> 1:17:50.208
-You are a go to continue power descent.
<i>-It looks good.</i>

1:17:50.291 --> 1:17:51.916
<i>-Yeah it's still on.</i>
<i>-Roger.</i>

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.833
<i>Pitch 212, yaw 537…</i>

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.583
<i>It's another major milestone.</i>

1:17:57.666 --> 1:17:59.958
-<i>Altitude, 40,000.</i>

1:18:00.041 --> 1:18:03.625
Getting a program alarm. 1202 alarm.

1:18:03.708 --> 1:18:05.500
<i>-Flight--</i>
<i>-We're go on that alarm?</i>

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:11.583
Roger. 1202. We copy it.
We are go on that alarm.

1:18:11.666 --> 1:18:14.416
<i>-Converging on Delta-H.</i>
<i>-Flight control, we have velocity.</i>

1:18:14.500 --> 1:18:15.958
<i>What's this alarm?</i>

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:18.333
<i>It's a go case</i>
<i>that's just apparently some…</i>

1:18:18.416 --> 1:18:20.625
<i>…Eagle, we'll monitor to Delta 8…</i>

1:18:20.708 --> 1:18:21.541
<i>…function.</i>

1:18:21.625 --> 1:18:24.583
<i>-It's coming up on the computer…</i>
-<i>Delta 8, look good now.</i>

1:18:24.666 --> 1:18:27.583
Well, at least this is more fun
than the simulator.

1:18:27.666 --> 1:18:29.083
-<i>I think that's given.</i>

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:30.708
<i>Okay. Roger.</i>

1:18:31.791 --> 1:18:34.291
<i>They could abort the landing</i>
<i>at that point.</i>

1:18:35.166 --> 1:18:37.166
<i>We're down to just minutes.</i>

1:18:37.250 --> 1:18:39.708
-Now reading 760 feet per second.

1:18:40.250 --> 1:18:42.208
<i>Okay, we've still got</i>
<i>landing radar guidance.</i>

1:18:42.291 --> 1:18:43.458
<i>-So far.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1:18:44.250 --> 1:18:46.375
<i>-Velocity 9,100 feet per second…</i>
-<i>Going fast.</i>

1:18:46.458 --> 1:18:48.333
<i>Switchover time, please, Houston.</i>

1:18:48.416 --> 1:18:51.625
<i>760 feet per second.</i>
<i>On their way down. </i>

1:18:51.708 --> 1:18:53.375
-Altitude, 4,200.

1:18:53.458 --> 1:18:55.291
<i>-Radar test.</i>
-You are a go for landing, Eagle.

1:18:55.375 --> 1:18:57.083
-<i>Roger.</i>

1:18:57.166 --> 1:18:58.541
<i>-Confirmed.</i>
-3,000 feet.

1:18:58.625 --> 1:19:01.666
We're go. 2,000 feet, 47 degrees.

1:19:01.750 --> 1:19:04.250
<i>-Roger.</i>
-Roger, Eagle. Lookin' good. You are a go.

1:19:04.333 --> 1:19:05.958
<i>How's America lookin', Bob?</i>

1:19:06.041 --> 1:19:06.958
<i>-It's okay.</i>

1:19:07.041 --> 1:19:08.375
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-We're on a high.</i>

1:19:08.458 --> 1:19:10.000
<i>Altitude, 1,600.</i>

1:19:11.916 --> 1:19:13.333
-<i>Up to the-- Let's go.</i>
-1,400.

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:15.000
You're lookin' good.

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:17.083
<i>They've got a good look</i>
<i>at their site now.</i>

1:19:17.166 --> 1:19:19.291
<i>-This is the critical time. They'll hover.</i>
<i>-1,400 feet.</i>

1:19:19.375 --> 1:19:20.875
<i>They're gonna make the decision.</i>

1:19:20.958 --> 1:19:22.666
750 feet.

1:19:24.458 --> 1:19:25.416
<i>We look good here.</i>

1:19:26.250 --> 1:19:27.500
540 feet.

1:19:27.583 --> 1:19:29.416
<i>The data's</i>
<i>coming in beautifully.</i>

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.083
<i>100 feet. Down at 19.</i>

1:19:31.666 --> 1:19:33.416
Big crater. Very rocky.

1:19:35.083 --> 1:19:36.416
Phew. Well…

1:19:37.916 --> 1:19:41.541
looks like you're gonna have to take over
the controls and land her yourself.

1:19:46.541 --> 1:19:48.125
<i>-Good.</i>

1:19:48.708 --> 1:19:49.916
<i>That's 20 feet.</i>

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:54.625
-<i>Sixty. Sixty seconds.</i>
-Sixty seconds.

1:19:54.708 --> 1:19:55.708
Lights on.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:58.041
Down two and a half. Forward.

1:19:58.125 --> 1:19:59.333
Forward.

1:20:00.416 --> 1:20:01.250
Forty feet.

1:20:01.875 --> 1:20:03.166
Pickin' up some dust.

1:20:04.166 --> 1:20:05.000
<i>Thirty feet.</i>

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:07.208
Big shadow.

1:20:10.083 --> 1:20:11.916
<i>Guys, lookin' good. Down a half.</i>

1:20:12.666 --> 1:20:13.500
<i>Pitch forward.</i>

1:20:15.083 --> 1:20:16.625
<i>-No level?</i>
<i>-No level.</i>

1:20:16.708 --> 1:20:18.333
Less than 20 seconds of fuel left.

1:20:20.791 --> 1:20:23.000
Forward. Drifting right.

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:25.166
-Contact light.

1:20:27.750 --> 1:20:28.875
Engine stopped.

1:20:29.458 --> 1:20:31.000
Engine arm off.

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:38.625
-<i>Engine arm off.</i>
-We're home.

1:20:38.708 --> 1:20:40.708
<i>-4-13 is in.</i>

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:41.833
<i>Man on the moon!</i>

1:20:44.166 --> 1:20:45.666
Eagle, we copy. You down?

1:20:46.833 --> 1:20:48.916
Houston, Tranquility Base here.

1:20:49.708 --> 1:20:51.250
The Eagle has landed.

1:20:54.125 --> 1:20:55.625
-Roger, Tranquility.

1:20:55.708 --> 1:20:57.000
We copy you on the ground.

1:20:57.083 --> 1:20:59.000
You got a bunch of boys
about to turn blue.

1:20:59.083 --> 1:21:01.375
-We're breathin' again. Thanks a lot.

1:21:04.166 --> 1:21:05.291
<i>Oh boy!</i>

1:21:05.375 --> 1:21:06.375
<i>Hmm.</i>

1:21:07.250 --> 1:21:09.875
<i>-Phew! Boy!</i>
<i>We're gonna be busy for a minute.</i>

1:21:10.583 --> 1:21:12.583
-That's real good.
<i>-Wally, I'm speechless.</i>

1:21:12.666 --> 1:21:14.666
-Whoo!
<i>-I'm just trying to hold onto my</i> <i>grub.</i>

1:21:14.750 --> 1:21:16.375
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1:21:25.916 --> 1:21:29.625
<i>We were way up in the air</i>
<i>on the Astro Way when we got the news.</i>

1:21:29.708 --> 1:21:32.208
-They landed!
-They're on the moon!

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:34.666
Cool, man!They did it!

1:21:35.916 --> 1:21:37.375
Yes, they did!

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:40.208
They did it!

1:21:40.291 --> 1:21:42.666
-They landed on the moon!
-Yeah, they made it!

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:43.875
Yay!

1:21:45.375 --> 1:21:48.833
<i>They were on the moon,</i>
<i>but nobody was sure when they would walk,</i>

1:21:48.916 --> 1:21:51.666
<i>so we just stayed close by,</i>
<i>glued to the screen.</i>

1:21:51.750 --> 1:21:54.000
<i>The Times yesterday ran an editorial</i>

1:21:54.083 --> 1:21:56.083
<i>saying Mr. Nixon was trying</i>
<i>to use this politically…</i>

1:21:56.166 --> 1:21:59.416
<i>It's lost to history, but at the time,</i>
<i>a lot of folks had a big problem</i>

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:01.583
<i>with how much it was costing</i>
<i>to go to the moon.</i>

1:22:01.666 --> 1:22:05.375
<i>What else we could be doing</i>
<i>with the money and what it represented.</i>

1:22:05.458 --> 1:22:09.166
<i>…more like 15th-century Spain.</i>
<i>We're discovering a new world.</i>

1:22:09.250 --> 1:22:14.833
<i>But, uh, I wonder if we don't have</i>
<i>our own Inquisition going in Vietnam,</i>

1:22:14.916 --> 1:22:17.458
<i>in the name of that great religion</i>
<i>of anti-communism…</i>

1:22:17.541 --> 1:22:21.375
What the hell is she doin' on TV,
on today of all days?

1:22:21.458 --> 1:22:23.875
-Who put her on?
<i>-I wonder…</i>

1:22:23.958 --> 1:22:26.458
I'll bet the phones
are ringin' off the hook at CBS.

1:22:26.541 --> 1:22:27.958
I think she looks cool.

1:22:28.041 --> 1:22:29.000
I love her hair.

1:22:29.083 --> 1:22:33.333
<i>When you look at Cape Kennedy, you find it</i>
<i>surrounded by a good deal of poverty.</i>

1:22:33.416 --> 1:22:35.125
<i>When you look at the Houston Center,</i>

1:22:35.208 --> 1:22:38.500
<i>less than 4%</i>
<i>of the employees there are Black…</i>

1:22:38.583 --> 1:22:40.250
Is that true, Dad?

1:22:40.333 --> 1:22:43.916
How many Black kids are in your class,
Greg? One? Of course it's true.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.166
<i>…is somewhat disturbing.</i>

1:22:45.250 --> 1:22:47.875
When are they gonna
walk on the moon?

1:22:47.958 --> 1:22:50.500
-Yeah. What are they waiting for?
<i>-I feel it's a great achievement</i>

1:22:50.583 --> 1:22:52.416
<i>as far as science is concerned.</i>

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:55.666
<i>But cash they wasted, as far</i>
<i>as I'm concerned, in gettin' to the moon</i>

1:22:55.750 --> 1:22:58.041
<i>could've been used</i>
<i>to feed poor Black people</i>

1:22:58.125 --> 1:23:01.416
<i>in Harlem and all over the place,</i>
<i>all over this country.</i>

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:04.750
<i>So never mind the moon.</i>
<i>Let's get some of that cash in Harlem.</i>

1:23:05.541 --> 1:23:06.375
Right on.

1:23:06.458 --> 1:23:09.416
<i>As Dr. Paine said earlier</i>
<i>on the earlier Apollo flight,</i>

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:11.541
<i>this was a triumph for the squares.</i>

1:23:11.625 --> 1:23:15.166
<i>I suppose that's one reason</i>
<i>people find this a little distasteful…</i>

1:23:15.250 --> 1:23:16.833
<i>After the day at AstroWorld,</i>

1:23:16.916 --> 1:23:20.375
<i>it was hard to keep your eyes open</i>
<i>as the coverage droned on and on.</i>

1:23:20.458 --> 1:23:22.583
<i>-This was done…</i>
-<i>There was so much waiting</i>

1:23:22.666 --> 1:23:24.916
<i>as the astronauts</i>
<i>struggled to get suited up</i>

1:23:25.416 --> 1:23:27.625
<i>-and the cabin depressurized.</i>
<i>-…haven't had an estimate…</i>

1:23:27.708 --> 1:23:29.833
-<i>I felt their pain.</i>
<i>-…as to how far they are…</i>

1:23:29.916 --> 1:23:33.500
<i>But I also couldn't help but think</i>
<i>of all the years of dreams and effort</i>

1:23:33.583 --> 1:23:36.083
<i>that were just now minutes away</i>
<i>from becoming a reality.</i>

1:23:36.166 --> 1:23:38.541
<i>-…an estimate of that.</i>
-Hey. They're about to step out.

1:23:38.625 --> 1:23:39.750
<i>That's okay. That's good.</i>

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:43.333
<i>He can't see where he's going.</i>
<i>He's backing out of the hatch.</i>

1:23:43.416 --> 1:23:45.958
-<i>So close… You're doin' fine.</i>
-<i>He didn't wanna</i>

1:23:46.041 --> 1:23:48.083
<i>catch on the side of that opening.</i>

1:23:49.125 --> 1:23:51.041
<i>Delicate suit and backpack.</i>

1:23:51.833 --> 1:23:54.125
<i>Okay, Houston,</i>
<i>I'm on the porch.</i>

1:23:55.333 --> 1:23:56.333
<i>Roger, Neil.</i>

1:23:57.083 --> 1:24:01.250
<i>We're gettin' a picture on the TV.</i>
<i>Three more steps, then a long one.</i>

1:24:01.750 --> 1:24:03.333
-<i>Okay.</i>
-<i>There's a foot…</i>

1:24:03.416 --> 1:24:06.291
<i>There he is.</i>
<i>There's a foot coming down the steps.</i>

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:09.291
<i>Neil, we can see you</i>
<i>coming down the ladder now.</i>

1:24:09.916 --> 1:24:11.041
<i>We can see you coming.</i>

1:24:12.875 --> 1:24:15.333
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

1:24:15.416 --> 1:24:18.583
<i>The LEM footpads are only, uh, depressed</i>

1:24:19.458 --> 1:24:21.166
<i>one or two inches,</i>

1:24:21.250 --> 1:24:25.791
<i>although the surface</i>
<i>appears to be very, very fine-grained</i>

1:24:25.875 --> 1:24:28.583
<i>as you get close to it,</i>
<i>it's almost like a powder.</i>

1:24:28.666 --> 1:24:30.375
<i>Look at those pictures.</i>

1:24:31.083 --> 1:24:33.041
<i>I'll step off the LEM now.</i>

1:24:41.666 --> 1:24:44.208
-<i>Armstrong is on the moon.</i>
<i>-I'll step off the LEM now.</i>

1:24:44.291 --> 1:24:45.125
There he is.

1:24:45.750 --> 1:24:49.291
<i>38-year-old American</i>
<i>standing on the surface of the moon.</i>

1:24:49.375 --> 1:24:51.541
Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1:24:51.625 --> 1:24:53.875
<i>It's one small step for man,</i>

1:24:54.791 --> 1:24:57.708
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

1:25:17.250 --> 1:25:19.833
<i>The surface is fine and powdery.</i>

1:25:19.916 --> 1:25:24.041
<i>I can…</i>
<i>I can pick it up loosely with my toe.</i>

1:25:25.083 --> 1:25:29.333
<i>It does adhere in fine layers, uh…</i>

1:25:29.416 --> 1:25:32.333
<i>like powdered charcoal to the…</i>

1:25:33.083 --> 1:25:36.166
<i>to the sole and sides of my boots.</i>

1:25:36.666 --> 1:25:41.458
<i>The footprints of my boots and the treads</i>

1:25:42.083 --> 1:25:46.041
<i>in the fine, sandy particles.</i>

1:25:46.625 --> 1:25:48.958
<i>Hey, look at the bounding step.</i>

1:25:49.541 --> 1:25:50.958
<i>Oh, look at that. Yes.</i>

1:25:51.041 --> 1:25:52.625
<i>Okay, ready for me to come out?</i>

1:25:52.708 --> 1:25:54.833
<i>Talk about being super casual.</i>

1:25:55.333 --> 1:25:56.416
<i>Yeah!</i>

1:25:57.375 --> 1:26:00.708
<i>-Boy, looks like fun, doesn't it?</i>
-<i>All right. That's got it.</i>

1:26:01.875 --> 1:26:02.708
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:17.791
-<i>Beautiful view.</i>
-<i>Isn't that somethin'?</i>

1:26:18.791 --> 1:26:20.625
<i>Magnificent sight out here.</i>

1:26:22.625 --> 1:26:24.416
<i>Magnificent desolation.</i>

1:26:28.916 --> 1:26:31.000
<i>We can kind of see</i>
<i>the footprints</i>

1:26:31.083 --> 1:26:33.416
<i>of man leaving footprints on the moon.</i>

1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:37.250
<i>Without any atmosphere there,</i>
<i>no wind, no rain to wear them away,</i>

1:26:37.333 --> 1:26:40.166
<i>they might stay there</i>
<i>for quite a long time.</i>

1:26:43.541 --> 1:26:45.833
<i>Houston,</i>
<i>Columbia on the high gain. Over.</i>

1:26:45.916 --> 1:26:48.291
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>The EVA is progressing beautifully.</i>

1:26:48.375 --> 1:26:50.291
<i>They're setting up the flag now.</i>

1:26:51.458 --> 1:26:52.625
<i>They've got the flag up now,</i>

1:26:52.708 --> 1:26:54.833
<i>-You can see the Stars and Stripes.</i>
Yeah.

1:26:54.916 --> 1:26:57.750
<i>You can see the Stars and Stripes</i>
<i>on the lunar surface.</i>

1:26:57.833 --> 1:26:59.666
<i>Beautiful. Just beautiful.</i>

1:27:00.166 --> 1:27:02.250
<i>So-called kangaroo hop.</i>

1:27:03.750 --> 1:27:06.041

<i>Tranquility Base, this is Houston.</i>

1:27:08.625 --> 1:27:11.250

<i>on the camera, please?</i>

<i>The President of the United States</i>

<i>That would be an honor.</i>

1:27:19.083 --> 1:27:23.375
<i>I'm talking to you by telephone</i>
<i>from the Oval room at the White House,</i>

<i>and this certainly has to be</i>

1:27:24.916 --> 1:27:27.875
<i>the most historic telephone call</i>
<i>ever made.</i>

1:27:27.958 --> 1:27:31.833
<i>I just can't tell you how proud we all are</i>
<i>of what you have done.</i>

1:27:31.916 --> 1:27:34.625
<i>This has to be</i>
<i>the proudest day of our lives.</i>

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:37.375
<i>Because of what you have done,</i>

1:27:37.458 --> 1:27:41.291
<i>the heavens have become</i>
<i>a part of man's world.</i>

1:27:42.208 --> 1:27:46.041
<i>And as you talk to us</i>
<i>from the Sea of Tranquility,</i>

1:27:47.041 --> 1:27:53.041
<i>it inspires us to redouble our efforts</i>
<i>to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.</i>

1:27:53.125 --> 1:27:54.916
<i>For one priceless moment</i>

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.750
<i>in the whole history of man,</i>

1:27:58.250 --> 1:28:01.458
<i>all the people on this Earth</i>
<i>are truly one.</i>

1:28:02.291 --> 1:28:04.708
<i>One in their pride in what you have done,</i>

1:28:05.208 --> 1:28:10.041
<i>and one in our prayers</i>
<i>that you will return safely to Earth.</i>

1:28:10.125 --> 1:28:11.916
Okay. Good night.

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000
Good night, hon.

1:28:13.083 --> 1:28:15.375
-<i>Thank you, Mr. President…</i>
-Good night, ladies.

1:28:15.458 --> 1:28:18.166
<i>-It's a great honor and privilege…</i>
-Good night, sweet peas.

1:28:18.958 --> 1:28:21.416
-Good night. See you in the morning.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.375
<i>…glad there are no chimpanzees</i>
<i>standing there…</i>

1:28:23.458 --> 1:28:25.791
-I think I'm gonna go to bed too.
-Okay.

1:28:27.041 --> 1:28:27.916
-Steven?
-Hey.

1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.125
-<i>What a day we've seen…</i>
-Let him go to sleep.

1:28:30.208 --> 1:28:33.958
-I'm tired. Good night.
<i>-…day such as man has never seen before.</i>

1:28:34.041 --> 1:28:37.000
<i>A day that has been played out</i>
<i>before our very eyes</i>

1:28:37.083 --> 1:28:39.833
<i>by this miracle that happily came along</i>

1:28:39.916 --> 1:28:43.750
<i>at the same time as man's exploration</i>
<i>of space - television.</i>

1:28:43.833 --> 1:28:47.500
<i>We have seen the men</i>
<i>exploring the moon in…</i>

1:28:47.583 --> 1:28:49.666
<i>oh, they're magnificent pictures,</i>

1:28:49.750 --> 1:28:53.416
<i>considering that they come from</i>
<i>a quarter of a million miles out</i>

1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:54.958
<i>and on the surface of the moon,</i>

1:28:55.041 --> 1:28:59.000
<i>man has landed there,</i>
<i>and man has taken his first steps there.</i>

1:28:59.083 --> 1:29:01.666
<i>I wonder, Eric Sevareid,</i>

1:29:01.750 --> 1:29:03.750
<i>just what there is to add to that.</i>

1:29:04.375 --> 1:29:07.125
<i>Uh, somehow,</i>
<i>they found a strange beauty there</i>

1:29:07.208 --> 1:29:10.958
<i>that I suppose they could</i>
<i>never really, uh, describe to us.</i>

1:29:13.375 --> 1:29:17.541
<i>It may not be a beauty that can</i>
<i>pass on to future beholders either.</i>

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:26.208
<i>Well, for thousands of years now,</i>
<i>it's been man's dream to walk on the moon.</i>

1:29:26.791 --> 1:29:30.666
<i>Right now, after seeing it happen,</i>
<i>knowing that it happened,</i>

1:29:30.750 --> 1:29:32.625
<i>it still seems like a dream.</i>

1:29:32.708 --> 1:29:35.250
<i>And it is, I guess, a dream come true.</i>

1:29:50.666 --> 1:29:52.000
-Greg.
What?

1:29:52.083 --> 1:29:52.916
Go to bed.

1:29:56.833 --> 1:29:57.666
Night.

1:29:58.166 --> 1:29:59.166
Good night.

1:30:05.041 --> 1:30:06.000
Wow.

1:30:06.666 --> 1:30:08.500
Congratulations. You did it.

1:30:08.583 --> 1:30:09.791
Well, we all did it.

1:30:09.875 --> 1:30:12.125
Oh, that's nice of you to say.

1:30:18.750 --> 1:30:21.041
Was Stan awake
when he took the first steps?

1:30:21.125 --> 1:30:24.500
I don't know. They were tired.
AstroWorld took it out of them.

1:30:24.583 --> 1:30:26.791
I just want him
to be able to tell his grandkids

1:30:26.875 --> 1:30:28.875
he saw the first steps on the moon.

1:30:32.416 --> 1:30:34.458
Well, you know how memory works.

1:30:35.041 --> 1:30:37.625
Even if he was asleep,
he'll someday think he saw it all.
