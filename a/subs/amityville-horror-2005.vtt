<i>Catch them.</i>

01:11.770 --> 01:14.295
<i>Kill them.</i>

02:54.907 --> 02:57.034
What's wrong, Ronnie?

03:00.779 --> 03:02.974
I love you, Jodie.

03:20.165 --> 03:21.826
<i>Suffolk County police.
May I help you?</i>

03:22.000 --> 03:23.524
<i>Everybody's dead.</i>

03:23.902 --> 03:25.665
<i>What do you mean,
"everybody's dead"?</i>

03:25.971 --> 03:27.905
<i>A guy come running
into the bar and says...</i>

03:28.073 --> 03:30.439
<i>his mother and father are shot.</i>

03:30.642 --> 03:33.338
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,
never seen one like this.

03:33.512 --> 03:36.003
<i>Six members of the family
were found last night...</i>

03:36.848 --> 03:39.214
in bed, shot...

03:39.551 --> 03:41.178
and killed.

03:42.287 --> 03:45.950
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,
his wife and four of their children.</i>

03:46.124 --> 03:47.751
<i>The sole survivor of the family...</i>

03:47.926 --> 03:50.190
<i>23-year-old
Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr...</i>

<i>The police state

03:54.600 --> 03:56.761
<i>they're holding him
in protective custody.</i>

03:56.935 --> 03:59.699
<i>Five of the victims were found
shot facedown on their beds.</i>

04:00.305 --> 04:02.034
The sixth was found in a closet.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.410
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

04:06.578 --> 04:10.446
<i>Suffolk County police have charged
23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr.</i>

04:10.616 --> 04:12.607
<i>The accused told police
he heard voices...</i>

04:12.784 --> 04:16.083
<i>coming from within the house,
telling him to murder his family.</i>

04:30.869 --> 04:32.860
Oh, God!

04:33.372 --> 04:34.896
Damn it.

04:44.216 --> 04:46.150
Hi, Michael.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.146
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

04:48.320 --> 04:50.311
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

04:51.123 --> 04:52.715
Nothing.

04:52.891 --> 04:54.654
- Yet.
- You perv.

05:02.601 --> 05:04.728
Come on up here, little man.

05:09.007 --> 05:10.872
You can make it.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.540
Oh, you're getting heavy.

05:18.350 --> 05:20.045
Did you meet my dad?

05:21.320 --> 05:22.981
No...

05:23.221 --> 05:24.654
never had the pleasure, pal.

05:26.158 --> 05:27.819
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

05:28.694 --> 05:30.321
- Guess what.
- What?

05:30.696 --> 05:33.392
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

05:33.565 --> 05:35.556
- Yep.
- Cool.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.634
- Anything.
- Cool.

05:37.803 --> 05:39.430
Yeah.

05:40.038 --> 05:41.903
- Stinky.
- Sure.

05:42.074 --> 05:43.632
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

05:43.809 --> 05:45.640
Crap-monkey-fart.

05:45.811 --> 05:49.110
Okay, we gotta draw the line
somewhere, pal, that does it.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.484
All right.

06:03.595 --> 06:05.722
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

06:05.897 --> 06:07.364
Billy.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.768
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to school.

06:10.936 --> 06:13.905
- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

06:14.072 --> 06:16.632
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

06:17.242 --> 06:19.369
I'll drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

06:19.544 --> 06:21.512
- Mom, I'm 12 years old.
- Before you plan...

06:21.680 --> 06:24.513
your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

06:24.683 --> 06:26.617
We got a big day.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.778
Why? Where are you guys going?

06:31.523 --> 06:34.219
- Mom, can you help me?
- Oh, Michael.

06:39.197 --> 06:41.324
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.195
Not according to this.

06:43.368 --> 06:46.963
- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.

06:47.139 --> 06:50.597
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

06:52.944 --> 06:54.775
Look, when the business
is going good...

06:54.946 --> 06:56.174
- we're gonna...
- There.

06:56.348 --> 06:57.576
- What?
- That's it.

06:58.216 --> 06:59.444
- Look.
- Honey.

06:59.618 --> 07:01.415
Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue.

07:07.826 --> 07:09.760
- It's beautiful.
- What?

07:25.811 --> 07:28.245
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.938
They get like that when they think
they'll make a sale.

07:31.116 --> 07:35.280
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

07:35.987 --> 07:37.545
Or not.

07:45.063 --> 07:47.088
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.426
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

07:49.601 --> 07:52.069
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

07:52.237 --> 07:56.264
You are going to love it.
Just follow me in here.

07:57.175 --> 07:59.700
Careful on the steps there.

08:16.628 --> 08:19.722
Holy shit.

08:20.599 --> 08:22.157
Excuse me.

08:22.334 --> 08:24.700
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.904
This... This is a mistake.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.370
How's that?

08:29.541 --> 08:31.702
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

08:32.977 --> 08:34.501
This is...

08:34.679 --> 08:36.840
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

08:37.015 --> 08:39.414
and I know what a place
like this should cost.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.881
And, you know, if this is...

08:41.052 --> 08:44.681
Well, if this is true, then this is a...
The deal of a lifetime.

08:45.056 --> 08:47.217
And what is wrong with that?

08:48.126 --> 08:50.890
- Come on.
- I love it.

08:54.199 --> 08:57.965
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

08:58.136 --> 09:01.867
In fact, the house was built
in 1692, at least the basement.

09:02.407 --> 09:04.875
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

09:05.043 --> 09:07.534
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.077
Wow, that's impressive.

09:09.247 --> 09:12.375
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

09:12.551 --> 09:16.612
And the view's...
Well, have a look for yourselves.

09:19.357 --> 09:20.984
There's a boathouse.

09:21.159 --> 09:23.127
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

09:23.295 --> 09:26.321
Actually, George has a speedboat.

09:26.898 --> 09:30.334
This place sounds
like it's made for you.

09:40.679 --> 09:43.705
And this is your basement.

09:43.882 --> 09:47.045
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

09:47.218 --> 09:49.846
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

09:50.021 --> 09:51.852
Well, let's... Let's have a look.

09:57.662 --> 10:00.688
I'll just wait up here.

10:06.304 --> 10:08.534
Yep, looks like a basement.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.731
So, what do you guys think?

10:10.909 --> 10:15.209
- I think you look foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.

10:26.891 --> 10:29.018
Yes, yes, okay?

10:29.361 --> 10:32.353
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

10:32.530 --> 10:35.624
Okay, look, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.461
We deserve this, George.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.729
You deserve this.

10:39.904 --> 10:42.600
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little.

10:42.774 --> 10:45.436
- Kathy...
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.337
- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.

10:48.513 --> 10:51.505
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

10:51.683 --> 10:53.947
this is the life we want.

11:09.534 --> 11:11.695
- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.395
She's happy. I'm broke.

11:16.441 --> 11:17.874
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:18.076 --> 11:22.308
So look, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

11:23.448 --> 11:25.746
There's always a catch.

11:27.185 --> 11:31.679
There was a tragedy, a crime...

11:31.856 --> 11:34.586
- a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

11:34.826 --> 11:36.691
In the house?

11:37.529 --> 11:38.996
Several people, a family.

11:41.199 --> 11:43.633
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

11:43.802 --> 11:46.498
It is a distant memory now.

11:47.272 --> 11:49.502
And the house is fine.

11:49.674 --> 11:51.198
Really.

11:51.409 --> 11:54.037
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

11:54.212 --> 11:56.407
Well, houses don't kill people.

11:56.648 --> 11:58.912
People kill people.

12:00.185 --> 12:03.211
Just... Excuse us.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.121
Do you think we can make it work?

12:12.564 --> 12:14.361
You know what?

12:14.799 --> 12:17.962
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

12:18.136 --> 12:20.297
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

12:20.472 --> 12:22.269
and you can, well...

12:23.241 --> 12:25.141
- sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.334
A little one.

12:42.293 --> 12:44.124
We're rich! We're rich!

12:44.629 --> 12:47.393
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

12:49.934 --> 12:51.401
Wait.

13:32.277 --> 13:34.973
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

13:35.213 --> 13:38.979
- What did you pray for?
- If I tell you, it won't come true.

13:40.051 --> 13:41.814
Why don't you tell him the truth.

13:41.986 --> 13:44.477
- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.322
William.

13:46.524 --> 13:50.051
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

13:52.197 --> 13:54.165
Don't say that.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.662
Sometimes things happen in life
that can't be explained, Billy.

14:07.779 --> 14:09.371
Billy, look at me.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.716
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

14:14.819 --> 14:18.016
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by liking George.

14:19.390 --> 14:22.018
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

14:22.594 --> 14:24.425
and maybe one day
something more.

14:25.029 --> 14:28.055
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

14:30.535 --> 14:32.196
For you too?

14:32.971 --> 14:34.632
For me too.

14:50.088 --> 14:51.817
How's Billy?

14:52.323 --> 14:53.984
He'll be fine.

14:55.426 --> 14:57.553
- First call.
- First call.

15:00.298 --> 15:03.790
- Lutz residence, how may I help you?
<i>- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

15:04.068 --> 15:08.300
Yeah, sure, she's...
She's right here. Okay.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.234
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

15:11.409 --> 15:13.343
It's embarrassing now.

15:13.878 --> 15:15.641
<i>Hello?</i>

15:16.414 --> 15:19.542
- Hey, Ma.
<i>- Hi.</i>

15:19.817 --> 15:22.047
No, we're all moved in.

15:24.155 --> 15:26.316
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you cold?

15:28.559 --> 15:30.390
No, Ma.

15:31.262 --> 15:32.262
Yeah.

17:37.321 --> 17:40.415
- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.

17:42.126 --> 17:45.152
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.664
I don't feel well.

18:03.181 --> 18:05.149
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

18:05.316 --> 18:06.840
No, you can't.

18:07.418 --> 18:10.148
Come here, come here.

18:12.023 --> 18:14.890
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

18:22.533 --> 18:25.559
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

18:28.439 --> 18:31.272
- Chelsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

18:31.442 --> 18:33.706
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

18:33.878 --> 18:37.439
- The girl who lives in my closet.
- Oh, yeah?

18:37.615 --> 18:39.913
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

18:40.918 --> 18:44.445
You know there are plenty of other
little girls to play with in town too?

18:44.622 --> 18:46.852
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

18:48.993 --> 18:50.255
Is that Jodie?

18:55.933 --> 18:58.424
No, that's someone else.

18:58.603 --> 19:00.093
Who?

19:00.271 --> 19:03.001
I'm not supposed to say who.

19:04.842 --> 19:07.367
She says it's an A-hole.

19:07.545 --> 19:10.036
You are not allowed
to say that word.

19:30.234 --> 19:32.429
George, George.

19:32.870 --> 19:35.634
- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?

19:35.806 --> 19:37.034
Harry and I found it.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.307
- Where?
- In the basement.

19:40.878 --> 19:42.436
Not the basement.

19:42.613 --> 19:44.672
My office.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.885
You listen to me.
You don't go down there.

19:49.654 --> 19:51.246
Understand?

19:58.896 --> 20:01.626
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

20:03.534 --> 20:05.934
Go on, go help your mom.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.772
I'm sorry.

20:14.412 --> 20:15.970
Go on.

20:30.394 --> 20:33.420
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

20:34.432 --> 20:37.196
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

20:37.368 --> 20:38.596
Billy will love that.

20:38.769 --> 20:40.760
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

20:43.407 --> 20:44.704
Where's Chelsea?

20:46.777 --> 20:48.369
Where's Chelsea?

20:57.989 --> 20:59.786
Chelsea?

21:07.431 --> 21:08.659
Chelsea?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.900
Chelsea!

21:17.241 --> 21:18.640
Chelsea.

21:18.809 --> 21:20.299
Hey, give me your hand.

21:20.611 --> 21:21.839
Give me your hand, sweetie.

21:22.013 --> 21:25.414
- Chelsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

21:31.155 --> 21:33.885
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

21:34.058 --> 21:35.958
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

21:39.096 --> 21:41.189
Somebody should have been
watching you.

22:41.392 --> 22:44.190
Billy, get up.

22:44.795 --> 22:47.320
Billy, I gotta go pee.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.403
Chelsea.

25:52.049 --> 25:53.778
Goddamn it, Harry.

25:56.887 --> 25:59.720
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

27:07.124 --> 27:08.614
Come on, get away from there.

27:08.859 --> 27:10.622
Hey, that's enough.

27:11.128 --> 27:12.755
Hey!

27:21.438 --> 27:23.872
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

27:24.742 --> 27:28.007
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

27:29.179 --> 27:31.306
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

27:35.919 --> 27:37.648
What is that?

27:39.590 --> 27:41.490
You tell me.

27:43.027 --> 27:45.928
- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sleep.

27:46.096 --> 27:47.757
I'm sorry, baby.

27:47.931 --> 27:49.728
Don't...

27:49.900 --> 27:52.630
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your kids, okay?

27:52.803 --> 27:55.363
- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.737
Billy's dog.

28:00.711 --> 28:02.144
Found him in the boathouse.

28:03.447 --> 28:05.938
- But you locked it.
- Yeah.

28:06.116 --> 28:08.676
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

28:16.994 --> 28:19.087
You ready to talk
about those keys?

28:19.263 --> 28:22.460
There's not a lot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

28:22.633 --> 28:25.033
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

28:25.202 --> 28:26.499
George.

28:37.781 --> 28:39.874
Get to work, buddy.

28:42.553 --> 28:45.044
"Get to work, buddy."

29:14.485 --> 29:16.544
"Katch 'em..."

29:18.589 --> 29:20.386
George?

29:20.891 --> 29:22.756
George?

29:23.393 --> 29:25.486
George, you down there?

29:27.498 --> 29:28.965
George?

29:31.502 --> 29:32.730
What?

29:32.903 --> 29:34.393
What's the matter?

29:36.473 --> 29:38.839
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

29:44.281 --> 29:46.579
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

30:17.014 --> 30:18.276
You look hideous.

30:18.448 --> 30:21.042
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

30:21.218 --> 30:23.709
- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?

30:23.887 --> 30:25.684
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

30:25.856 --> 30:27.983
- I'm old enough.
- Baby, I know you can...

30:28.158 --> 30:32.094
I'm not letting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't let her. I won't.

30:32.729 --> 30:34.697
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, listen to me.

30:34.865 --> 30:38.028
- I won't leave you alone.
- I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

30:38.202 --> 30:39.794
- I told you I was old enough.
- Hi.

30:39.970 --> 30:42.666
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

30:43.273 --> 30:45.207
Can I take your coat?

30:45.475 --> 30:47.067
Okay.

30:49.012 --> 30:50.775
Hi.

30:52.649 --> 30:53.911
I'm Billy.

31:03.527 --> 31:06.155
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

31:06.396 --> 31:08.387
Would you like me
to show you around?

31:08.565 --> 31:09.862
No, it's okay.

31:10.033 --> 31:12.695
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

31:16.940 --> 31:18.840
Kind of freaky being back here.

31:19.276 --> 31:20.868
I'm Billy.

31:21.078 --> 31:23.012
Yeah, I got you the first time.

31:23.814 --> 31:25.941
Have a good night, Billy.

31:34.091 --> 31:36.082
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

31:36.260 --> 31:38.922
Yeah. Definitely.

31:39.096 --> 31:41.030
You feeling all right?

31:41.331 --> 31:42.923
You know what?

31:43.100 --> 31:44.931
I feel better.

31:45.903 --> 31:48.371
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

31:48.538 --> 31:50.301
Come on, drink up.

31:50.474 --> 31:52.408
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

31:53.543 --> 31:55.807
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

31:55.979 --> 31:57.776
Hopefully, I won't have to.

32:05.188 --> 32:06.985
Be right out.

32:18.068 --> 32:19.296
Hungry?

32:20.337 --> 32:22.430
Kid, you read my mind.

32:22.973 --> 32:24.235
The kids, they're...

32:24.408 --> 32:26.569
They're going through
a tough time.

32:26.743 --> 32:29.109
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

32:29.279 --> 32:31.304
Yeah, well, we all are.

32:33.183 --> 32:35.117
Do you feel different?

32:37.587 --> 32:39.248
What do you mean?

32:39.423 --> 32:41.186
About us.

32:42.826 --> 32:44.726
About me.

32:48.398 --> 32:49.626
Yeah.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.028
Yeah, I do.

32:53.003 --> 32:57.133
I feel like for the first time in my life,
I'm sure about something.

32:58.008 --> 32:59.839
And that's you.

33:01.678 --> 33:04.806
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making you happy.

33:05.515 --> 33:08.416
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

33:19.162 --> 33:21.687
Some people say his tongue is fake.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.559
I think it's all him.

33:28.071 --> 33:29.504
Got this at a pinball arcade.

33:30.874 --> 33:32.398
Cool.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.809
So do you French?

33:37.347 --> 33:38.939
Do I what?

33:39.116 --> 33:41.676
Kissing, tongues.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.281
No.

33:46.556 --> 33:49.116
Did your family know the Defeos?

33:49.359 --> 33:52.692
- The who?
- The family that lived here before you.

33:55.165 --> 33:56.826
No, we just moved here.

33:57.634 --> 34:00.398
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

34:01.972 --> 34:02.972
No.

34:03.473 --> 34:05.668
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

34:08.378 --> 34:10.869
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

34:12.716 --> 34:14.342
It's okay.

34:18.388 --> 34:20.253
Stop. That's not how you play.

34:20.424 --> 34:24.884
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

34:25.862 --> 34:28.092
You're killing him.

34:29.966 --> 34:32.958
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that lived here.

34:33.770 --> 34:36.739
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

34:36.907 --> 34:41.206
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

34:41.378 --> 34:42.743
So he kills it.

34:43.980 --> 34:47.609
A few days later, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

34:48.118 --> 34:49.641
So you know what he did?

34:49.985 --> 34:51.283
Wasted them.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.284
How did he do it?

34:55.625 --> 34:57.559
Do what?

34:57.727 --> 35:00.287
You are way too young to hear this.

35:00.464 --> 35:02.557
So cover your ears.

35:03.934 --> 35:06.459
And don't listen.

35:06.736 --> 35:08.397
A rifle.

35:10.774 --> 35:13.971
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

35:15.178 --> 35:18.341
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

35:18.882 --> 35:20.679
Right here.

35:21.685 --> 35:23.710
In these beds.

35:30.927 --> 35:34.192
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.601
Actually, it's fucking sick.

35:40.637 --> 35:42.468
Yeah.

35:42.939 --> 35:44.668
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

35:46.476 --> 35:48.876
I suck at babysitting.

35:55.051 --> 35:57.519
This was the little brat's room.

35:58.021 --> 35:59.989
Jodie's.

36:02.025 --> 36:04.357
You know, they found her in there.

36:05.128 --> 36:07.688
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

36:07.998 --> 36:11.229
Well, Jodie's...
What's the word? Dead.

36:11.835 --> 36:13.359
Is not.

36:13.537 --> 36:15.232
That little shit got me fired.

36:19.142 --> 36:20.871
Dare you to go in there.

36:22.812 --> 36:24.837
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

36:27.050 --> 36:28.517
Okay.

36:29.452 --> 36:31.181
Okay.

36:33.456 --> 36:35.686
You're going to make her mad.

36:44.801 --> 36:46.564
Come on, guys.

36:48.638 --> 36:50.230
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

36:50.407 --> 36:51.840
Billy, Michael.

36:54.578 --> 36:56.273
It's not opening. I can't open it.

36:56.446 --> 36:58.380
- Unlock the fucking door.
- There's no lock.

36:58.548 --> 37:00.277
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

37:00.450 --> 37:02.441
Billy, Michael.

37:03.086 --> 37:05.611
Let me out. Let me out of here.

37:06.723 --> 37:07.951
Let me out of here!

37:11.728 --> 37:13.093
What's going on?

37:13.496 --> 37:14.827
Let me out.

37:15.565 --> 37:17.692
Hi, Lisa.

37:21.471 --> 37:23.098
Look what Ronnie did.

37:42.626 --> 37:44.287
Let me out!

37:45.028 --> 37:46.962
Let me out of here!

37:47.998 --> 37:49.465
Let me out!

37:49.633 --> 37:52.067
Help me. Let me out!

38:02.312 --> 38:04.303
I saw Jodie.

38:04.481 --> 38:05.778
I saw Jodie.

38:05.949 --> 38:07.473
Who's Jodie?

38:07.751 --> 38:09.776
The little girl.

38:11.488 --> 38:13.149
She's dead.

38:13.323 --> 38:15.655
She's supposed to be dead.

38:22.399 --> 38:24.890
- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.

38:25.068 --> 38:27.536
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

38:27.704 --> 38:29.399
Shut up!

38:31.808 --> 38:33.366
- George.
- I got this under control.

38:33.543 --> 38:35.340
You don't have you under control.

38:38.381 --> 38:40.212
What you guys did was wrong.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.942
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

38:43.119 --> 38:45.053
whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

38:46.122 --> 38:49.148
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

38:49.526 --> 38:51.619
This house is bad, Mommy.

38:52.228 --> 38:53.718
Michael, honey.

38:53.930 --> 38:57.832
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

38:59.536 --> 39:02.630
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

39:05.742 --> 39:08.074
- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter told me...

39:08.244 --> 39:11.543
that two little boys died
in our room.

39:17.253 --> 39:19.312
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

39:20.990 --> 39:23.185
Get to bed. We'll deal with this
in the morning.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.590
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

39:25.762 --> 39:28.128
- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid look off your face...

39:28.298 --> 39:29.788
and go to bed.

39:32.936 --> 39:34.528
Run.

39:57.193 --> 39:59.388
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

40:00.663 --> 40:04.360
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

40:07.203 --> 40:10.036
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

40:10.206 --> 40:13.073
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

40:13.243 --> 40:14.642
So Jodie hurt her.

40:15.412 --> 40:17.573
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

40:17.981 --> 40:20.449
Jodie won't hurt you.

40:20.884 --> 40:22.749
She thinks you're a good mommy.

40:26.089 --> 40:27.954
But the man who lives here...

40:28.992 --> 40:31.654
she says he's bad.

40:32.595 --> 40:35.359
She wants him to go away.

40:35.665 --> 40:39.157
He makes her do bad things.

40:46.209 --> 40:47.574
Move it...

40:47.744 --> 40:49.644
from there to there.

40:49.813 --> 40:51.144
Go.

40:56.286 --> 40:58.652
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

41:38.361 --> 41:39.885
What?

41:40.964 --> 41:43.797
Is this discipline or torture?

41:43.967 --> 41:46.128
Thought it was meat loaf.

41:53.009 --> 41:56.172
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

41:56.446 --> 41:58.573
It's what my dad taught me.

41:58.748 --> 42:02.115
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

42:12.595 --> 42:16.053
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

42:16.232 --> 42:20.032
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

42:20.470 --> 42:22.495
And a weirdo.

42:22.705 --> 42:25.538
And a doofus and a dipstick.

42:25.742 --> 42:27.869
<i>Catch them.</i>

42:28.044 --> 42:30.035
<i>Kill them.</i>

42:33.082 --> 42:35.107
<i>Catch them.</i>

42:35.752 --> 42:37.617
<i>Kill them.</i>

42:45.028 --> 42:47.622
<i>Catch them. Kill them.</i>

42:49.399 --> 42:51.333
<i>Catch them.</i>

42:51.501 --> 42:53.401
<i>Kill them.</i>

43:10.486 --> 43:12.477
Kill them.

44:28.865 --> 44:30.958
- No! No!
- Look at me.

44:31.134 --> 44:33.432
- No!
- What's the matter?

44:34.003 --> 44:36.096
- God!
- It's me.

44:36.272 --> 44:38.399
- It's me.
- God!

44:42.745 --> 44:45.077
Baby, it's all right.

44:51.854 --> 44:54.288
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

44:54.457 --> 44:56.652
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

44:56.826 --> 44:58.657
some serious thought.

45:01.597 --> 45:04.589
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

45:04.767 --> 45:08.601
Actually, I feel great now.

45:09.706 --> 45:11.333
Weird as that may sound.

45:12.875 --> 45:15.207
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

45:15.378 --> 45:17.005
No sign of any bruising at all.

45:20.249 --> 45:22.740
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

45:23.786 --> 45:26.983
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

45:27.156 --> 45:30.182
- Do I look nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

45:30.359 --> 45:32.793
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

45:41.137 --> 45:42.934
I feel like it's my fault, George.

45:43.106 --> 45:45.199
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this place.

45:45.374 --> 45:47.740
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the life...

45:47.910 --> 45:49.434
that I want too, okay?

45:51.247 --> 45:54.273
We got the old American dream here.

45:54.517 --> 45:56.576
Okay? There's no way in hell...

45:56.753 --> 45:58.687
that I'm letting that get away now.

46:02.592 --> 46:03.820
I love you, George.

46:10.266 --> 46:12.826
Billy, can I get my teddy?

46:13.002 --> 46:14.970
She's real hungry.

46:15.138 --> 46:18.164
Okay, go. And hurry up.

46:18.341 --> 46:21.105
Mom finds out I let you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

46:45.935 --> 46:47.266
Hi, Mommy.

46:47.436 --> 46:49.734
Look at me, Mommy.

46:49.939 --> 46:51.338
Hi, Mommy.

46:54.777 --> 46:56.768
Hi, Mommy.

46:57.713 --> 46:59.078
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

46:59.248 --> 47:02.581
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down.

47:03.786 --> 47:05.276
Chelsea.

47:12.395 --> 47:14.056
Chelsea.

47:16.933 --> 47:18.924
Hold the ladder.

47:19.168 --> 47:20.863
Honey, stay there.

47:24.006 --> 47:25.871
Chelsea.

47:26.108 --> 47:27.507
Chelsea.

47:30.646 --> 47:33.080
- Chelsea.
- Goddamn it, Chelsea.

47:33.249 --> 47:36.412
Which way?
Which way did they go?

47:36.986 --> 47:38.476
Going left.

47:48.497 --> 47:50.362
Chelsea.

48:09.285 --> 48:10.877
What are you doing up here?

48:13.856 --> 48:15.289
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

48:15.591 --> 48:17.115
Baby...

48:17.293 --> 48:19.284
you come to Mommy.

48:20.296 --> 48:21.558
No!

48:24.600 --> 48:26.227
George.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.529
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

48:31.774 --> 48:33.469
George!

48:33.643 --> 48:35.873
George, please, God, I'm slipping.

48:37.546 --> 48:39.036
George!

48:39.715 --> 48:41.683
George!

48:45.621 --> 48:47.088
<i>Chelsea.</i>

48:48.190 --> 48:49.650
What would you...?
Why would you do that?

48:49.692 --> 48:51.785
Sorry. I'm sorry.

48:51.994 --> 48:53.586
You can't do that to Mommy.

48:53.763 --> 48:57.130
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

48:57.300 --> 48:59.234
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

48:59.402 --> 49:02.303
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's real.

49:03.439 --> 49:06.840
- Jodie's real. She's...
- She is not real!

49:07.009 --> 49:08.977
Liar! Liar!

49:09.145 --> 49:10.806
Liar!

49:12.782 --> 49:14.807
I've seen her.

49:17.153 --> 49:19.212
She was gonna show me Daddy.

49:19.388 --> 49:21.856
I just wanted to see Daddy.

49:23.059 --> 49:25.152
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

49:25.328 --> 49:27.819
She says I can stay here
so we can play together...

49:27.997 --> 49:29.760
forever and ever.

49:31.701 --> 49:33.760
Do you miss your daddy?

49:33.936 --> 49:35.426
Yes.

49:35.604 --> 49:38.903
- Do you miss your daddy a lot?
- Yes.

49:40.710 --> 49:42.974
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

49:44.246 --> 49:46.009
But no one can see him because...

49:46.682 --> 49:48.616
he's in heaven.

49:49.952 --> 49:51.476
He's with the angels.

49:52.922 --> 49:55.288
He's with the angels.

49:59.462 --> 50:01.657
I just got so scared.

50:12.274 --> 50:13.866
What's the matter with you people?

50:23.919 --> 50:25.853
Wacko family.

50:56.352 --> 50:57.876
Father Callaway?

50:58.487 --> 51:00.045
Father.

51:00.923 --> 51:02.686
Kathy Lutz.

51:02.858 --> 51:04.325
Hello.

51:04.927 --> 51:06.861
Do you have a moment?

51:11.567 --> 51:14.536
It's my family.

51:15.004 --> 51:17.336
We've changed. It's...

51:17.540 --> 51:19.701
It's like we've grown apart.

51:20.810 --> 51:22.801
I don't think I understand.

51:26.282 --> 51:29.615
There's something...

51:30.352 --> 51:33.412
There's something evil in my house.

51:37.326 --> 51:39.487
I know it sounds...

51:39.662 --> 51:41.926
crazy, I know that.

51:42.098 --> 51:44.328
I would think the same.

51:45.201 --> 51:46.964
I just don't know where else to go.

51:53.709 --> 51:55.802
There was a family...

51:56.245 --> 51:57.610
lived here some time ago.

51:59.148 --> 52:01.446
They had a similar problem.

52:01.617 --> 52:03.084
The Defeos.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.615
You knew them?

52:08.657 --> 52:10.420
I'm living in their house.

52:18.234 --> 52:19.929
Now, hold it steady.

52:20.102 --> 52:23.037
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.741
Go!

52:38.120 --> 52:39.485
What, are you crying?

52:40.656 --> 52:43.386
Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.

52:43.893 --> 52:45.827
Pick up another log.

52:46.195 --> 52:47.662
Hurry up, pick up another log.

52:47.830 --> 52:49.457
Hurry up.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.998
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

52:54.370 --> 52:55.632
No.

52:56.105 --> 52:57.732
Put...

52:58.707 --> 53:01.733
We're friends.
We're having fun, right?

53:01.911 --> 53:03.378
Put your hands up there.

53:11.887 --> 53:13.821
Go!

54:11.981 --> 54:14.211
Come here, little girl.

54:19.622 --> 54:22.182
You're my favorite girl.

54:43.379 --> 54:44.869
<i>Catch them.</i>

54:45.047 --> 54:46.912
<i>Kill them.</i>

57:38.053 --> 57:39.714
George.

57:43.525 --> 57:45.686
I think there's something
seriously wrong here.

57:46.895 --> 57:49.022
Something's not right.

57:50.466 --> 57:52.297
What's not right?

57:55.871 --> 57:57.532
We need to get out of here.

57:57.706 --> 58:00.937
To just go. Just pack up and go.

58:02.344 --> 58:04.505
No, no, no.

58:04.847 --> 58:07.941
You know, you can't run away
from your problems, Kath.

58:09.985 --> 58:11.612
Please, let's go, George.

58:12.421 --> 58:15.356
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

58:17.159 --> 58:20.026
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

58:20.863 --> 58:24.230
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big...

58:25.534 --> 58:28.833
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just walk away from it.

58:36.445 --> 58:38.242
How did you get so fucking stupid?

58:39.515 --> 58:41.346
What?

58:43.418 --> 58:47.411
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

58:47.589 --> 58:49.580
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

58:49.825 --> 58:51.224
Oh, our money.

58:52.160 --> 58:54.594
George, we're losing each other.

58:54.763 --> 58:56.697
Don't you see that?

58:57.466 --> 58:59.991
We stay here,
we'll have a house for the family...

59:00.168 --> 59:02.329
only there won't be a family.

59:05.274 --> 59:07.834
It's always so cold in here.

59:09.378 --> 59:12.438
Would you let the stove alone
and pay attention to me?

59:12.614 --> 59:14.377
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

59:14.550 --> 59:16.017
So shut up about that!

59:16.585 --> 59:18.177
Just shut up!

59:18.587 --> 59:20.077
Goddamn it.

59:20.589 --> 59:22.887
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

59:23.058 --> 59:24.389
Well, now you got it.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.289
Mom! Mom!

59:26.595 --> 59:28.688
Home sweet home.

59:32.734 --> 59:33.962
What is it, sweetie?

59:34.136 --> 59:36.400
We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.

59:38.307 --> 59:40.298
I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie.

59:40.509 --> 59:42.500
You seen Harry, George?

59:43.211 --> 59:45.202
No, I haven't, Billy.

59:48.250 --> 59:49.911
Maybe he ran away.

59:50.085 --> 59:51.552
Harry never runs away, George.

59:52.621 --> 59:54.714
What's the matter with you, William?

59:54.890 --> 59:56.448
Get out of here now.

59:56.625 --> 01:00:00.721
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, Michael.

01:00:29.157 --> 01:00:31.853
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:48.270
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:49.842
Hold on a second.

01:00:50.345 --> 01:00:52.438
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

01:00:52.614 --> 01:00:54.138
Who is it, honey?

01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:57.181
Come in, Father.

01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:08.858
This is gonna sound strange...

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:12.831
but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is holding?

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:16.298
Well, that belonged to the little girl
who lived here before you.

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.572
Yes, it was left here.

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.709
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here.

01:01:24.446 --> 01:01:26.971
Father, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

01:01:27.149 --> 01:01:30.744
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeral.

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:33.878
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:45.761
Oh, heavenly Father.

01:01:47.502 --> 01:01:49.493
Almighty God...

01:01:53.942 --> 01:01:56.376
we ask you to bless...

01:01:57.979 --> 01:02:00.607
and sanctify this house.

01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:07.712
To bless all who live here...

01:02:08.223 --> 01:02:13.092
and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

01:03:06.615 --> 01:03:09.311
<i>Get out.</i>

01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:15.016
Father!

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.851
Father!

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:21.585
Why are you leaving us?

01:03:22.264 --> 01:03:24.027
What's the matter?

01:03:29.938 --> 01:03:33.772
It's okay. I'm here.

01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:58.390
<i>Catch them.</i>

01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:00.091
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:04:06.374 --> 01:04:09.275
Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

01:04:11.246 --> 01:04:12.838
<i>Catch them.</i>

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:16.510
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:04:43.378 --> 01:04:45.437
<i>Catch them.</i>

01:04:46.815 --> 01:04:48.874
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:04:49.718 --> 01:04:51.811
<i>Catch them.</i>

01:05:26.521 --> 01:05:28.580
<i>There was a crime. A murder.</i>

01:05:28.857 --> 01:05:30.290
<i>You know, the town has moved on.</i>

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:35.361
<i>And it is a distant memory now,
and the house is fine.</i>

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:49.467
We don't open
for a few more minutes.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.320
"Voices told him to do it."

01:06:10.332 --> 01:06:13.130
"He just moved into the basement."

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:17.502
"Twenty-eights days later
he killed them all."

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:32.280
Oh, my God.

01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:26.069
"Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham."

01:07:36.918 --> 01:07:39.580
"He started a mission for Indians."

01:08:26.201 --> 01:08:28.328
"He slaughtered them all."

01:08:40.982 --> 01:08:44.417
"Over 20 bodies were found
in the lake."

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:03.633
<i>Catch them.</i>

01:09:05.974 --> 01:09:07.965
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:09:35.904 --> 01:09:37.564
Father.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.733
Why did you run away
from my house?

01:09:43.745 --> 01:09:45.736
Why did you abandon us?

01:09:46.346 --> 01:09:49.645
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.584
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

01:09:57.158 --> 01:10:01.390
who tortured Indians on my land.
On my basement.

01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:09.297
I read about how he slit his throat...

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:12.030
so that his presence
would live forever.

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.539
Do you believe this could be true?

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:18.175
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

01:10:18.346 --> 01:10:23.374
and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:26.216
I didn't believe him until yesterday.

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:32.683
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family
out of that house...

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.191
right now.

01:10:47.609 --> 01:10:48.837
- Hello?
<i>- George.</i>

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:51.308
<i>George, I've just been to see
Father Callaway.</i>

01:10:51.479 --> 01:10:54.471
<i>Listen to me, you gotta get you
and the kids out of the house.</i>

01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:57.084
<i>George?</i>

01:10:58.419 --> 01:10:59.943
<i>Are you there? George?</i>

01:11:13.534 --> 01:11:17.937
Billy! Michael! Where's George?

01:11:18.106 --> 01:11:20.233
He's in the boathouse.

01:11:37.925 --> 01:11:41.156
George, we have
to get out of here now.

01:11:41.329 --> 01:11:42.921
George!

01:12:22.737 --> 01:12:24.671
Are you fucking crazy, George?

01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:26.498
Have you lost your mind?

01:12:26.674 --> 01:12:28.232
You tried to kill me.

01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:36.314
- Chelsea!
- Mommy! Mommy!

01:12:36.484 --> 01:12:37.849
I'm down here, Mommy!

01:12:39.187 --> 01:12:41.747
Chelsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

01:13:09.884 --> 01:13:11.511
I think she misses her daddy.

01:13:14.822 --> 01:13:16.380
Don't you?

01:13:17.759 --> 01:13:19.590
Give me back my daughter.

01:13:25.299 --> 01:13:29.133
I wanna talk to you. Wait.
I wanna talk to you!

01:13:30.004 --> 01:13:32.438
Kids, get down here, now!

01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:34.438
Kids, get down here!

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.975
- Billy, help me push this!
- Mom, where are you going?

01:13:40.481 --> 01:13:42.039
Billy!

01:13:43.284 --> 01:13:44.546
- Hurry. Go.
- Billy!

01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:47.951
Mom, why are you wet?

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:51.554
Mommy! Mommy!

01:13:53.728 --> 01:13:55.491
Come on, Mom!

01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.362
Hurry.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.534
Billy, come on!

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.545
Run! Go, go, go!

01:14:20.354 --> 01:14:21.981
You're stuck! You're stuck!

01:14:22.423 --> 01:14:24.050
Stay here!

01:14:26.627 --> 01:14:27.855
Great!

01:14:28.696 --> 01:14:32.496
Let go of my mom, you bastard!
Let go right now! Let go.

01:14:37.071 --> 01:14:39.767
- What the hell is your problem?
- Let's go.

01:14:40.775 --> 01:14:42.538
These kids are out of control.

01:14:45.213 --> 01:14:48.011
- Mom, it's stuck!
- It won't open!

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:52.149
Where's Chelsea? Chelsea!

01:15:05.666 --> 01:15:10.126
- Hurry, hurry, Billy. Hurry.
- Come on. Let's go. Be quiet, be quiet.

01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:56.747
Billy!

01:16:42.496 --> 01:16:44.794
I want you to hold on tight.

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.305
Jump, baby.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.011
- Come on, honey.
- Come on.

01:17:01.182 --> 01:17:02.809
- Come on, Michael.
- No, Mommy.

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:04.975
- No.
- Hurry, baby.

01:17:05.953 --> 01:17:08.353
Come on, Michael.
Come on, Michael.

01:17:09.557 --> 01:17:11.286
- Come on, hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

01:17:14.128 --> 01:17:16.653
- Come here. Come here.
- No.

01:17:19.467 --> 01:17:21.799
You leave him alone.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.532
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:30.138
Don't hurt him!

01:17:32.146 --> 01:17:34.307
Back the fuck up!

01:18:16.223 --> 01:18:17.656
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:18:25.633 --> 01:18:28.329
Hurry. Let's grab some rope.

01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:32.171
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:53.692
Kathy, kill me!

01:18:54.395 --> 01:18:56.420
You kill me, or I'll kill you!

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.961
Nobody's dying today.

01:19:20.888 --> 01:19:23.755
Okay, let's get him in the boat.

01:19:47.915 --> 01:19:50.076
Why are we taking him?
Let's just leave him here.

01:19:50.251 --> 01:19:53.618
I can't explain it to you right now. We
have to get him away from the house.

01:20:52.413 --> 01:20:54.574
Don't even look at it, Kathy.

01:20:54.815 --> 01:20:56.305
Let's get out of here.
