WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:05.756
It's the grand opening
of Langley's first ever
Grand Grocer,

00:05.881 --> 00:08.092
and the stars are out.

00:08.217 --> 00:09.677
That's right, Greg.

00:09.802 --> 00:12.304
<i>All the city's top elite
are in attendance.</i>

00:12.430 --> 00:14.682
<i>Quiet, Trish.
Mayor Garfield's
about to speak.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:18.060
I inaugurate unto this town

00:18.185 --> 00:22.356
a most glorious mercantile
that I understand is to be...

00:22.481 --> 00:25.067
Racially integrated?

00:26.485 --> 00:28.612
Let's just cut
the blasted ribbon already

00:28.738 --> 00:31.615
and let in
the kind of despicable
work-shy lunkheads

00:31.741 --> 00:33.909
who attend
a grocery store opening.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.913
- Grocery store!
Grocery store!
- Whoa! Yeah! Yeah!

00:41.000 --> 00:43.753
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

00:43.878 --> 00:47.298
<i>♪ I got a feeling
That it's gonna be
a wonderful day ♪</i>

00:47.423 --> 00:50.092
<i>♪ The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face ♪</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:53.721
<i>♪ And he's shining a salute
To the American race ♪</i>

00:56.724 --> 00:59.810
<i>♪ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ♪</i>

00:59.935 --> 01:02.188
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:02.313 --> 01:03.230
Ah!

01:04.982 --> 01:08.360
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

01:08.486 --> 01:10.446
This place has everything.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.781
It's so smart.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.240
People come to get fish.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.867
They see the
beautiful fish, right?

01:14.992 --> 01:16.994
They're smelling
the big fish smells,

01:17.119 --> 01:18.829
listening to the
high-powered sink

01:18.954 --> 01:22.958
washing bloody scales
off the thick forearms
of the fish-chopping men.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.794
What are they gonna be?
Hungry, right?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.545
I already wanted fish later,

01:26.670 --> 01:29.340
but now I'm hungry
for fish now.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.424
A sushi bar?

01:30.549 --> 01:31.842
Right here?
Boom.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.803
It's so smart.

01:33.928 --> 01:37.056
But what if you drop
a top-quality piece
of yellowtail,

01:37.181 --> 01:39.350
dripping in
wasabi-thickened
soy sauce,

01:39.475 --> 01:41.435
right on your new
"Life is Good" T-shirt?

01:41.560 --> 01:42.895
- Oh, no.
- Boom.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.104
Dry cleaner right there.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.232
It's just so smart.

01:46.357 --> 01:48.692
Hold up. I gotta nab
a real quick prescription

01:48.818 --> 01:50.903
at this convenient as hell
pharmacy. Boom.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.572
A climbing wall?

01:53.697 --> 01:55.199
Lure a bunch of
lean climbers in,

01:55.324 --> 01:57.952
let them grip around
till they're half mad
with hunger,

01:58.077 --> 01:59.787
then turn them loose
in a grocery store?

01:59.912 --> 02:02.206
It's smart, Francine,
like you've been saying.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.916
I see you're taking
Liflafluvia.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.501
Let me go over
some of the side--

02:05.626 --> 02:07.336
I've taken Liflafluvia before.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.505
I get all the side effects,
every last one.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.758
Leg bloat, numb fingers,
ear closure, memory loss,

02:12.883 --> 02:16.136
phantom tail, and last
but not least, memory loss.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.013
Sounds like it's hard
on your body.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.723
- What do you
take it for?
- I forget.

02:19.849 --> 02:20.766
Wha...

02:21.517 --> 02:22.935
No [bleep] way.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.353
What are you doing here?

02:24.478 --> 02:27.523
- I came to check it out.
- Us too. Insane.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.608
When are the three
of us ever together?

02:29.733 --> 02:30.860
We should get a drink.

02:32.111 --> 02:33.362
Aw, too bad we're in
a normal grocery store.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.446
As if!

02:35.072 --> 02:36.532
To the Grand Grocer.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.868
What was once
a Korean War memorial

02:38.993 --> 02:40.828
is now finally
something we can use.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.500
Can I say how nice it's been,

02:46.625 --> 02:49.086
coming here every day
this month with you guys?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.714
Klaus has been all over me
about my drinking,

02:51.839 --> 02:55.092
and these mid-morning drinks
are really helping me relax.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.094
It's certainly
enriched my life.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.762
Just staring
at the bank
over there

02:58.888 --> 03:02.057
has me this close
to opening my first
checking account.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.602
It's an odd duck,
the grocery store bank.

03:04.727 --> 03:08.022
It's a real bank.
Vault, guard,
everything but--

03:08.147 --> 03:11.275
Something always
made me think
it'll be easier to--

03:11.400 --> 03:14.528
Never mind. Must be
the third Midori Sour
before 11:00 a.m. talking.

03:14.653 --> 03:15.738
Easier to rob?

03:15.863 --> 03:16.947
Sure, I've thought that too.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.866
- You have?
- Yeah, I see it.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.076
All the distraction
of a grocery store

03:21.201 --> 03:22.453
gives the robber good cover.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.706
Totally agree.
Also, I'm hammered.
I need food.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.918
These olive bar olives
are mixing nicely
in my stomach

03:29.043 --> 03:30.377
with the martini olives.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.671
How would someone
rob the bank,

03:32.796 --> 03:34.590
if they were gonna do it?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.636
You know, for banks,
protocol during a robbery
is not to risk human life.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.679
Guards only shoot
if they see a weapon.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.391
Huh. So the worst thing
to bring to a robbery--

03:44.516 --> 03:45.643
Is a gun.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.728
Give me all the money
or I shoot.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.396
- You got a gun?
- You bet.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.023
- Let me see it.
- Check it.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.527
Just terrible. Awful.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.237
You know what
isn't awful, though?

03:58.948 --> 04:00.658
The Marcona almonds
they're putting out
at this olive station.

04:00.783 --> 04:01.992
Holy shit.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.245
Okay. So guns wouldn't work.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.539
The real issue is
how to do a robbery

04:07.665 --> 04:09.416
without being identified.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.836
Well, if there's one thing
I know, it's disguises.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.964
Hey, sweets.
Long day.
Am I right?

04:15.089 --> 04:16.882
I'm the new
armored truck driver.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.593
We've never met.
I'm here to pick up
the cash. I'm new.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.512
Sure. What's
the 10-digit code?

04:21.637 --> 04:22.805
No prob, beautiful.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.265
That 10-digit code
is I got a gun. Here it is.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.644
Just awful.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.021
That bloodthirsty guard
is a big problem.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.106
Wait. Where is he?

04:32.231 --> 04:33.607
It's 12:15.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.110
That's when they put out
the rotisserie chickens.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.404
And he gets one every day.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.489
He gets one every day.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.574
And that's when we'd rob the--

04:42.700 --> 04:43.826
Wait. What am I saying?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.411
I'm a lawman.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.205
To this day,
I'm hot under the collar
about Al Capone's antics.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.790
You gotta relax, Stan.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.375
No one's robbing anything.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.127
It's just a simple
thought experiment.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.295
Yeah. And here's a thought.

04:55.421 --> 05:00.092
What if you got someone else
to rob the bank for you?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.136
What if you got...
Hear me out.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.221
...a cake to rob the bank?

05:04.346 --> 05:07.224
They take a lot of
orders over the phone,

05:07.349 --> 05:09.852
and never seem
to give much thought

05:09.977 --> 05:11.478
to what people want
written on them.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.397
Twenty-four-inch sheet cake.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.523
The message?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.774
"Sorry, Glen.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.484
"You are not the father."

05:17.609 --> 05:19.319
You want that
delivered, darling?

05:19.445 --> 05:20.946
They deliver, huh?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.823
The message?

05:22.948 --> 05:26.035
"You're being robbed.
Give me all your money."

05:26.160 --> 05:27.619
You want cursive or print?

05:27.745 --> 05:28.912
My cursive ain't great.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.792
Time for big baby
to get his chicky.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.002
Cake delivery.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.380
Hey, burglars.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.882
Where do I put the money?

05:40.007 --> 05:40.966
Smoosh it in the cake?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.134
Seems stupid.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.385
We're not stupid.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.763
I think I know
where the money
should go.

05:45.888 --> 05:46.889
Peep this.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.310
<i>Janitorial to kombucha bar.</i>

05:51.435 --> 05:52.686
Then you can call in,

05:54.063 --> 05:55.105
access the PA
without even being
in the store.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.274
But you need the dial-in code.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.650
It's one, four, three.

05:58.776 --> 05:59.693
I saw it.

06:00.778 --> 06:01.904
Oh, wow.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.906
So, it could go like this.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.741
"This is a robbery.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.743
"Put the money
in your waste basket,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.578
then lock yourself
in the vault."

06:09.703 --> 06:11.080
Wait a second.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.289
That's 68 letters.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.582
You're gonna need
a bigger cake.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.882
<i>Waste basket full
at bank counter.</i>

06:22.007 --> 06:24.259
<i>Janitorial to
bank counter, please.</i>

06:29.932 --> 06:31.850
Then we grab the money
from that dumpster

06:31.975 --> 06:33.519
and walk out through
the loading dock.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.938
No. There's cameras outside.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.523
- Excuse me.
- Go around me.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.775
No cameras here.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.529
<i>What if we hid the cash
in a bag of flour,</i>

06:43.654 --> 06:46.406
<i>then put it in that
reshelving area?</i>

06:46.532 --> 06:48.492
<i>Then it'd go back
on the shelves,</i>

06:49.827 --> 06:52.246
<i>and using a burner phone...</i>

06:52.371 --> 06:53.997
<i>Ooh, burner phone.</i>

06:54.123 --> 06:56.917
<i>...we order
an InstoShopper to pick it up</i>

06:57.042 --> 07:00.337
<i>and they deliver
the money right to us.</i>

07:00.462 --> 07:02.214
We'll have to be
in the bathroom

07:02.339 --> 07:04.133
to put the money in the flour.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.969
But the only people
doing things on camera

07:07.094 --> 07:08.470
would be the baker,

07:08.595 --> 07:10.806
the janitor, the reshelver

07:10.931 --> 07:12.266
and the InstoShopper.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.935
And after the InstoShopper
delivered the cash,

07:15.060 --> 07:16.812
we could change
his tip to zero.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.896
Double heist.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.481
Did we think of everything?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.316
Maybe.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.153
Look, they're not
responding to emails
or phone calls

07:24.278 --> 07:25.571
for what seems like years.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.782
I think we have to face
the very real possibility

07:28.907 --> 07:31.451
that Mah Mah
and Bah Bah
have died.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.538
Oh, no. Dye packs.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.957
The teller's put dye packs
in with the money.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.964
Where'd they go?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.174
Bah Bah...

07:45.299 --> 07:46.884
The dye packs are activated

07:47.009 --> 07:48.594
by a battery-powered
transmitter.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.554
If the money gets
too far from the bank,

07:50.679 --> 07:51.805
it explodes.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.348
Try to tamper
with the dye pack,

07:53.473 --> 07:54.433
it explodes.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.059
How long does
the battery last?

07:56.185 --> 07:57.144
Top of my head?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.021
504 hours. Three weeks.

07:59.146 --> 08:03.609
So if the money doesn't move,
the dye pack won't explode?

08:03.734 --> 08:06.278
What if the dye packs
weren't a problem?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.988
What if they were
the solution?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.072
Listen.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.200
Even if we could
get away with it,

08:11.325 --> 08:13.994
the cops would still be
looking for the money.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.163
But you know
the kind of
stolen money

08:16.288 --> 08:17.372
no one looks for?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.166
Greek money?

08:19.291 --> 08:20.542
The kind of money

08:20.667 --> 08:23.086
they think they've
already found.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.632
<i>I put the real money
in the rice.</i>

08:26.757 --> 08:27.966
<i>And in the flour--</i>

08:28.091 --> 08:29.551
<i>Counterfeit money.</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:30.886
<i>Counterfeit dye.</i>

08:38.977 --> 08:42.272
A rather ingenious
plan foiled.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.107
Money destroyed
but accounted for.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.234
Case closed.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.662
And then we bring
the money here,

08:56.787 --> 08:58.622
to this beautiful nearby hill.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.290
It doesn't have to
be in the plan,

09:00.415 --> 09:01.959
but I'd really like it to be.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.378
My only loose end,
and I mean only,

09:04.503 --> 09:06.088
is in the three weeks
we'd be waiting,

09:06.213 --> 09:07.965
someone will surely
buy the rice.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.967
We'd put it in brown rice.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.760
The perfect plan.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.514
So I think we've
all been sleeping

09:15.639 --> 09:17.099
pretty badly this week.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.183
I'm sleeping great.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.476
With those bags
under your eyes?

09:20.769 --> 09:21.645
And your lips looking like
sunbaked earthworms?

09:21.770 --> 09:22.854
I don't think so.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.232
If we need someone
to say it, I'll say it.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.608
I think we should
rob the bank.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.694
- Roger, no.
- Absolutely not.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.028
It was a thought experiment.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.989
There's no point
to really robbing the bank.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.115
The plan is the point.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.241
It's perfect.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.450
- Maybe--
- No.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.952
- Yeah. No. No way.
- Never.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.204
We're not
the kind of people
that rob banks.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.498
And even though
we'd definitely
get away with it,

09:41.623 --> 09:43.625
we'd always be haunted
by what we'd done.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.210
Would it change your mind

09:46.795 --> 09:48.130
if I told you
I've been thinking of us
as the Three Musketeers?

09:48.255 --> 09:50.590
<i>A bank robbed by a cake?</i>

09:50.716 --> 09:52.259
<i>It's crazy but true.</i>

09:52.384 --> 09:54.928
<i>As last night,
at our beloved
Grand Grocer,</i>

09:55.053 --> 09:56.388
<i>an attempted bank robbery</i>

09:56.513 --> 09:59.057
<i>began with a demand
written in icing</i>

09:59.182 --> 10:02.769
<i>and ended with an unknowing
InstoShopper covered in dye.</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:05.272
<i>Police say it was
an ingenious plan,</i>

10:05.397 --> 10:07.899
<i>but with the money
all blasted up and inky,</i>

10:08.025 --> 10:09.318
<i>it looks like these thieves</i>

10:09.443 --> 10:11.278
<i>won't get to have their cake</i>

10:11.403 --> 10:12.946
<i>and steal it too.</i>

10:14.573 --> 10:17.326
Nobody beats the boys in blue.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.247
I can't believe you robbed
the bank without me.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.749
But with Stan to do the phone

10:23.874 --> 10:25.792
and Francine to do
the bathroom switch,

10:25.917 --> 10:28.045
it must have been easy
to cut old Roger out.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.921
Technically, one person
could've done it all

10:30.047 --> 10:31.298
with the phone
in the bathroom.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.008
Is that how you did it?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.301
I didn't rob the bank.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.303
Well, I didn't rob the bank.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.389
That's why no one
wanted to do it when I asked.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.557
You'd already done it.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.226
That's why
you asked us to do it.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.479
So we wouldn't think
you'd already done it.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.439
That's why
he gave us coffee.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.024
He poisoned the co--

10:49.149 --> 10:50.901
I didn't poison
the coffee.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.319
And I didn't do the robbery.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.987
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.530
But we all heard the news.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.324
That was the first half
of our plan.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.785
Which leaves the second half.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.454
How about we go down
to the store right now,

11:02.579 --> 11:04.998
check the rice section
for big bags of cash?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.166
Sounds good to me.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.251
How does it sound to you?
To both of you?

11:13.465 --> 11:14.508
Nothing.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.551
So, you moved it, huh?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.721
Pretty cute, Stan
and/or Francine.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.223
You hid it
in the store
somewhere,

11:21.348 --> 11:22.933
just waiting out the dye pack.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.267
Stop acting like
it wasn't you.

11:24.393 --> 11:25.435
It's always you.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.896
Unless it was you,
my treacherous queen.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.357
I'm the only one
I know isn't lying.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.817
Isn't lying about what?

11:31.942 --> 11:35.028
Isn't lying about my age.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.363
I'm 17,

11:37.697 --> 11:38.532
so I can't be tried
as an adult.
Who are you?

11:38.657 --> 11:39.908
Detective Turlington.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.202
I'm... investigating
the bank robbery.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.286
Oh, really?

11:43.412 --> 11:44.913
And how is that going?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.748
The robbers didn't
get the money.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.917
So it's not...
a high priority.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.210
Makes good sense.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.045
So you think
you have the money?

11:52.170 --> 11:53.171
Be quiet, Roger.

11:54.297 --> 11:54.798
You'd like that,
wouldn't you,
you snake?

11:56.299 --> 11:57.634
Just saying not everything's
what it seems in this world,

11:57.759 --> 12:00.262
money being real-wise.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.014
Roger, that was stupid,
goading Turlington like that.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.183
I'm innocent
and I've nothing to fear.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.643
I didn't do it,

12:08.103 --> 12:08.478
but we've got a whiteboard
with the perfect plan on it.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.605
And I don't want
the cops involved,

12:11.982 --> 12:13.817
'cause when I figure out
which one of you did this,

12:13.942 --> 12:16.361
I'm gonna whap
the top of your foot
with a hammer.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.405
I demand
to search your things.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.823
I have nothing to hide.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.033
You cool with that, Stan?

12:22.159 --> 12:23.952
Hella cool.
What about you, Roger?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.912
Why, yeah. I have
lots of things to hide.

12:26.037 --> 12:26.997
I'm a real sick ticket.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.583
But I didn't do this.
Search away.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.042
You weren't kidding, Roger.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.962
I saw some truly
horrifying things.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.214
But nothing to link you
to the robbery.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.757
And you two checked out.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.759
Underwear all smells
nice and clean.

12:39.885 --> 12:43.763
Is there a possibility that
maybe none of us did it?

12:43.889 --> 12:46.766
Oh, another team
of absolute hottie geniuses

12:46.892 --> 12:48.643
figured out the same
perfect robbery?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.728
Unlikely.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.730
Someone could have
overheard us.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.064
I can be a little shouty.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.400
I miss how it was yesterday.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.860
When we were getting along

12:56.985 --> 12:59.613
and not calling each other
snakes all the time.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.198
Okay. Then let's
erase this board,

13:01.323 --> 13:03.074
in case Turlington
comes poking around.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.535
The Three Musketeers again.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.041
A burner phone?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.001
- Snakes.
- Betraying snakes.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.588
I'm taking this phone
to Turlington right now.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.672
How do you like that?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.716
I'm absolutely gaga about it.

13:19.841 --> 13:23.220
It's not my phone,
so I like it a lot.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.722
Don't test me.
Just come clean now.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.266
This is your last chance,
whoever I'm speaking to.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.268
Hot evidence, coming through.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.854
Detective Turlington will be
with you in just a moment.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.943
Oh, someone's hosed.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.778
This phone is
full of evidence.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.155
Calls to the bakery
and store intercom.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.823
The InstoShopper order.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.408
Videos of us-- Wait. What?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.785
<i>Liflafluvia.</i>

13:48.328 --> 13:48.995
<i>It will wipe our memories
for this whole day.</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:51.414
<i>If we do the job right now
during this window,</i>

13:52.874 --> 13:53.833
<i>Stan won't be haunted
by any pesky guilt.</i>

13:55.418 --> 13:56.211
<i>And none of us will be
witnesses to what we did.</i>

13:57.587 --> 13:58.922
<i>That's turning
the perfect heist into--</i>

13:59.047 --> 14:00.924
<i>The perfect heist.</i>

14:01.049 --> 14:02.008
<i>All right, Stan.</i>

14:03.176 --> 14:03.385
<i>You place
the cake order, then--</i>

14:04.928 --> 14:05.720
<i>Wait. We almost forgot
to take the Liflafluvia.</i>

14:07.722 --> 14:09.599
We all robbed the bank?

14:09.724 --> 14:12.060
<i>Oh, almost forgot
the crucial Liflafluvia.</i>

14:12.185 --> 14:14.062
That doesn't prove we did it.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.856
It just looks like
we're getting high
in the basement.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.441
Which is fine, and cool.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.568
There's a second video.

14:19.693 --> 14:20.694
God damn it.

14:20.819 --> 14:24.072
<i>We did it! We robbed the bank!</i>

14:24.197 --> 14:26.116
I hear you have... evidence.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.076
Yes. A fingerprint.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.120
A fingerprint? Where is it?

14:30.245 --> 14:32.664
It was on some ice.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.915
But it melted.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.001
So... we should go.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.253
You're the people
from the rice aisle.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.671
Is eating rice a crime?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.923
You know, we checked the cash.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.426
Turned out it was fake,
as was the dye.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.262
You said something
about that, right?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.847
People say a lot of things
in the rice aisle.

14:48.972 --> 14:49.973
I don't know.

14:51.099 --> 14:51.600
I think the cash
is still in the store

14:53.226 --> 14:53.935
and the robbers are
waiting for the dye pack
battery to run out.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.063
I think, to me,

14:57.188 --> 14:59.649
that all sounds
like mumbo-jumbo.
Right?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.027
- I mean, what?
- Total mambo-jambo.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.279
We'll let you get back to
your impenetrable forensics,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.698
you everyday hero.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.076
<i>If you're watching this, us,
you just pulled it off.</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:12.912
<i>All you have to do
is go to Grand Grocer
to pick up the cash</i>

15:13.038 --> 15:14.039
<i>when the battery dies.</i>

15:15.290 --> 15:15.582
<i>We changed our minds
on the rice</i>

15:16.833 --> 15:17.459
<i>and found a cool
new hiding spot.</i>

15:18.376 --> 15:19.502
<i>And that spot is inside--</i>

15:19.628 --> 15:21.004
<i>Holy smokes. Is that a wolf?</i>

15:22.047 --> 15:24.966
<i>My God. That was so beautiful.</i>

15:25.091 --> 15:27.385
<i>They really are
like gorgeous dogs.</i>

15:27.510 --> 15:30.889
<i>I love seeing a wolf
after robbing a bank.</i>

15:31.014 --> 15:32.474
We got to destroy this phone.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.267
Agreed. Then we're
free and clear.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.352
Yes, let's.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.812
But also, we should
finish the job.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.105
No. No way.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.066
It's a miracle
we've gotten away
with it so far.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.360
It's not a miracle,
it's the perfect heist.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.778
And I say, in a few weeks,

15:44.903 --> 15:46.529
when the dye pack
battery dies,

15:46.655 --> 15:47.781
we go down there,

15:49.032 --> 15:49.824
find the hidden money
and finish this thing.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.117
Turlington knows.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.036
He's gonna be
all over that store.
I'm out.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.371
It's over, Roger.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.247
But we're
the Three Musketeers.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.875
That was never something
I agreed to or understood.

15:59.000 --> 15:59.959
That's a candy.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.003
So I'm gonna do it myself?

16:15.350 --> 16:16.434
Need some help?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.521
I can't stand the idea

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
of a bank getting
its money back.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.609
And I just watched
<i>The Three Musketeers</i>
with Chris O'Donnell.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.819
I get it now.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.320
He's cute and sexy.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.864
All for one and one for all.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.533
Oh, I like that.
Who says that?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.201
Is it from something
or just you?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.208
Let's stay calm.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.335
We just have to get
inside our minds

16:42.460 --> 16:43.962
and figure out what
we were thinking

16:44.087 --> 16:45.130
when we hid the cash.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.924
Let's get it
before the cops do.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.427
Oh, also, we need
honey mustard
pretzel nubbins.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.553
We're out?

16:51.678 --> 16:52.846
Listen up.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.432
$50,000 is hidden
somewhere within the store.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.892
As of right now,
the dye pack battery
is dead.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.853
I believe the robbers
will be back for the money.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.439
We have to catch them
or find it first.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.065
Ideally, both.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.442
But you guys have a reputation

17:05.567 --> 17:07.068
for being the worst cops
in the country.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.154
But I'm confident
you're gonna serve this force

17:09.279 --> 17:11.239
with distinction,
bravery and--

17:11.364 --> 17:13.908
Because we're cops,
can we eat anything
in the store for free?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.410
- No.
- What if we
search something

17:15.535 --> 17:16.703
and now it's open?

17:17.996 --> 17:18.663
They can't sell it, right?
We can eat it then.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.291
Cheddar is slang for money.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.960
Is the money, like,
pushed into some cheese?

17:24.085 --> 17:27.046
In the video,
we said it was a cool
new hiding spot.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.758
Is there somewhere
food is kept cool?

17:29.883 --> 17:31.092
Not the rotisserie chickens.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.385
Those are hot.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.637
Let's eat two each,
see if we get any ideas.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.390
The freezer section.
That's cool.

17:37.515 --> 17:38.892
Think the money
could be in here?

17:39.017 --> 17:41.227
- In the big
rubber ball thing?
- Yeah.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.772
- Underneath the balls?
- Yeah.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.064
Oh, that's definitely
where it is.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.652
Oh, these balls
are under arrest!

17:54.574 --> 17:57.076
If I know my own brain,
it has to be here.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.537
Because these
Jimmy Dean
Breakfast Nuggets

17:59.662 --> 18:00.955
are money in the bank.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.959
Tamales. Like the saying.
"That's a lot of tamales."

18:05.084 --> 18:07.879
Whoa, these tamales
are a lot of tamales.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.130
This isn't right.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.383
That's it. The triceratops.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.720
Three horns.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.263
One horn per friend.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.100
It's empty.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.145
But you're on to something.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.981
The hiding place
could be about us,
our friendship.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.233
Gold Top Nuts?

18:28.358 --> 18:30.360
The best.
But the can's too small.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.112
Nuts. Nuts. Marcona almonds.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.405
They're in the olive bar,

18:34.531 --> 18:36.282
but they also carry
a big tub of them

18:36.407 --> 18:38.493
that's so expensive
no one could ever buy it.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.661
The almonds.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.162
That might actually be it.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.330
And they're over there.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.540
Look at
the brand name.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.752
I don't speak much Italian,

18:47.877 --> 18:49.379
and I don't even
think that is Italian,

18:49.504 --> 18:51.965
but I think we just
found the cash.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.633
Now let's get out of here.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.511
If it isn't
the rice aisle gang.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.720
I know what you're doing here.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.807
Oh, whatever are you
talking about?

19:00.932 --> 19:03.476
Oh,
like you don't know...

19:03.601 --> 19:09.148
<i>that someone
hid $50,000 somewhere
in this store.</i>

19:09.274 --> 19:10.316
<i>Why am I loud?</i>

19:10.441 --> 19:11.818
<i>Do I sound loud to you?</i>

19:11.943 --> 19:14.237
Money riot!

19:17.115 --> 19:19.701
I need that money
because I want it!

19:20.410 --> 19:22.537
No, no, no!

19:25.039 --> 19:27.208
Are you in there, money?

19:28.793 --> 19:30.336
I have to deal
with this fireball.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.964
Don't you dare
use this fireball

19:33.089 --> 19:35.258
as an opportunity
to escape my questioning.

19:38.469 --> 19:42.098
<i>♪ This money
is tearing us apart ♪</i>

19:43.725 --> 19:45.476
This is it.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.271
The perfect end
to the perfect heist.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.480
And once again, gang,

19:49.606 --> 19:51.024
sorry for dropping
the almond tub

19:51.149 --> 19:52.734
all the way down the hill
so many times.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.277
Busted.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.653
If you don't mind.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.989
And here it is, at long last.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.157
Fifty thousand...

20:00.116 --> 20:01.618
Almonds?

20:01.743 --> 20:03.703
What? I mean, of course.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.204
Uh, yeah.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.915
What'd you think
you were gonna find?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.251
The missing paintings
of the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.253
By the way, store's on fire.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.632
My keys are in there!

20:17.175 --> 20:19.928
So, we didn't find it.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.430
But it looks like
no one else will either.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.474
And we'll always have
the wonderful memory

20:24.599 --> 20:25.767
of nearly pulling off the--

20:25.892 --> 20:28.561
What's this? Damn it.
We took this again?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.021
Well, we didn't find the money

20:30.146 --> 20:31.481
and we won't
remember the heist.

20:31.606 --> 20:32.649
But I don't know.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.776
At least we destroyed
the grocery store?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.611
We loved that grocery store.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.321
We sure did.
