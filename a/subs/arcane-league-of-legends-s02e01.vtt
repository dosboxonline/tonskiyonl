And we've been asleep at our posts.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.458
Well, my eyes are open.

There will be no more fairy tales of peace

So kind of you
to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.082
As we are at war,

06:36.083 --> 06:40.250
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice
of such an experienced veteran.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.707
Let us address the matter at hand.

06:43.708 --> 06:46.165
Our people are scared, suffering.

06:46.166 --> 06:49.582
They need to know their leaders
have the situation under control.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.665
An unprecedented show of force.

06:51.666 --> 06:56.124
We flood the undercity with Enforcers,
armed with Hextech.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.916
Innocents will be caught
in the cross fire.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.082

07:09.875 --> 07:12.290
Officer Kiramman witnessed
the attack firsthand.

07:12.291 --> 07:15.708
She confirmed this was the act
of a single deranged individual.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.249
Jinx.

[Mel] Silco is dead.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.457

07:20.458 --> 07:23.582
If we follow your plan,
we risk unifying them against us.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.125
So, what is your solution? Chastisement?

07:26.666 --> 07:27.874
A firm reprimand?

07:27.875 --> 07:30.040
We use their division against them.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.624
Pin the attack on Jinx,

07:31.625 --> 07:34.374
post a reward too substantial to ignore.

07:34.375 --> 07:38.499
I'm sorry, Mel. I'm not comfortable
trusting our fates to chance.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.124
Jinx has proven elusive.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.833
Our healing can only begin
once she's been brought to justice.

07:48.208 --> 07:51.625
Then it's settled, 2 to 1.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.375
We invade.

07:57.541 --> 08:00.499
If I may? In crises such as these,

08:00.500 --> 08:04.374
it's imperative you present
a unified front to the public,

08:04.375 --> 08:06.541
whatever your personal feelings.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.125
How wise.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.208
I'll agree to endorse the invasion.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.500
But I draw the line at Hextech.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.165
We have an ethos.

08:21.166 --> 08:24.166
Such force must be a final resort.

Agreed.

11:24.541 --> 11:25.915
I can make this right.

If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets,
I can do this myself.

11:29.791 --> 11:31.666
No one else needs to get hurt.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.124
No.

No more rogue mission.

No more reckless plans.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.249
My mother was right.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.874
My arrogance led me
to take on more than I could handle,

11:40.875 --> 11:42.500
and she paid the price.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.833
They're sending
all the Enforcers after Jinx.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.375

that not all of Zaun supports Jinx.

All I know for certain
is that it's keeping him alive.

It's the sort of puzzle
Viktor would love if he wasn't...

15:01.791 --> 15:04.166
It should be me up there instead of him.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.458
Don't say that.

He'll come back to us.

to make a play for Hextech.

I see Mother.

17:34.458 --> 17:35.583
When they found her.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.832
And every fiber of me just sinks,

17:38.833 --> 17:41.291
like a stone swallowed in dark water.

Suffice to say, she declined.

Cait said all that?

19:53.291 --> 19:57.082
She said if every Enforcer
had a heart like yours,

19:57.083 --> 19:58.790
we could take on Noxus itself.

19:58.791 --> 20:00.165
[Maddie chuckles]

20:00.166 --> 20:02.791
Then she threatened
to withdraw her family's funding.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.125
Anyhow, I'm glad you're joining up.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.208
Hmm.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.707
[Maddie] After the sheriff betrayed us...

20:11.708 --> 20:14.375
Well, let's just say...

20:15.750 --> 20:18.458
it's nice to know
there are still good ones left.

20:23.791 --> 20:26.416
[fanfare playing]

20:39.750 --> 20:40.875
[man] Officer Nolen.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.000
[Maddie] Duty calls.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.125
A real honor, Vi.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.458
[snoring]

20:50.333 --> 20:51.333
[sighs]

20:56.666 --> 20:58.333
[snoring]

21:03.250 --> 21:05.250
[solemn music playing]

21:07.666 --> 21:09.707
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- This way, ma'am.

21:09.708 --> 21:12.250
- Stop.
- [guard] Please keep moving, folks.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.166
Mm-hm.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.541
One of the many privileges
of serving as your councilor

21:56.083 --> 21:59.916
is having the occasion now and again
to stand behind this podium

22:00.500 --> 22:02.041
to behold so many

22:02.583 --> 22:07.125
joined together not by birth or dictum
but by all that we share.

22:08.291 --> 22:09.583
Our hope.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.958
Our curiosity.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.958
Our compulsion to leave behind us
a world better than that before.

22:20.333 --> 22:24.083
These things we share
are what make us one people.

22:37.166 --> 22:42.250
Today we share an unthinkable loss.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.625
Councilor Irius Bolbok,

22:46.333 --> 22:47.999
Councilor Torman Hoskel,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.416
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman
were taken from us.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.000
But they shall not be forgotten.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.832
We commissioned this statue

23:00.833 --> 23:03.791
so we may remember them
for their countless contributions...

23:06.291 --> 23:08.208
their lifetimes of service.

23:10.083 --> 23:13.040
Not for the craven act
that stole them away.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.832
[guard] Ma'am, you can't go in...

23:14.833 --> 23:16.333
[distorted dialogue]

23:19.208 --> 23:21.583
[Mel] Though we've suffered
a terrible blow,

23:22.791 --> 23:26.500
I assure you,
the rule of law prevails in Piltover.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.500
- No.
- [Mel] We will find those responsible.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.791
And they will account for their crimes.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.500
Awful, isn't it?

23:40.375 --> 23:42.416
Losing a loved one.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.000
[gasps]

24:12.166 --> 24:15.166
[leader] You aren't safe up here, toppers.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.416
None of you are safe.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.000

26:54.416 --> 26:56.290
Get the counselors out of here.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.374
I have an idea.

26:57.375 --> 26:58.832
What are you doing?

26:58.833 --> 27:00.958
[suspenseful music playing]

30:10.000 --> 30:11.291
Shit.

[both yelling]

31:32.958 --> 31:34.958
[somber music playing]

31:46.833 --> 31:48.415
[Enforcer 1] Perimeter secured.

31:48.416 --> 31:49.333
We'll see.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.958
Thought you were gonna
get yourself killed.

32:10.708 --> 32:11.540
[child sobbing]

32:11.541 --> 32:13.000
[Enforcer 2] Here, come with me.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.582
A memorial.

32:14.583 --> 32:15.666
I got you.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.957
What kind of animals?

32:18.958 --> 32:20.957
They wanted the spectacle.

32:20.958 --> 32:22.707
They're trying to scare you.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.041
All they did is piss me off.

32:25.625 --> 32:26.458
You...

32:27.250 --> 32:30.040
You need to find a way
to call off the invasion.

32:30.041 --> 32:31.082
What?

32:31.083 --> 32:33.249
This battle was on your soil.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.540
Down there, you'll be on their terms.

32:35.541 --> 32:38.457
None of this is on our terms.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.750
- [Vi] Maybe you should change that.
- I don't know how, okay?

32:42.375 --> 32:45.249
She dies and leaves this giant hole,

32:45.250 --> 32:47.666
and I'm just supposed to fill it.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.666
Like she was never there to begin with.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.000
[Vi] Hey.

32:52.583 --> 32:53.416
You won't.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.750
The hole gets smaller, but...

32:56.791 --> 32:57.875
you never fill it.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.750
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.374
It's just...

33:08.375 --> 33:10.166
every way I slice it,

33:10.708 --> 33:12.665
if I go after your sister alone,

33:12.666 --> 33:14.791
one of us comes back in a box.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.208
It's all coming apart.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.000
[Vi] No, it isn't.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.833
We won't let it.

into the dungeons of our capitol.

34:30.750 --> 34:31.958
But here we are.

34:32.708 --> 34:37.666
Does anyone still doubt that our enemy
is greater than one deranged individual?

34:38.208 --> 34:41.957
How did they sneak so many
of these things into the ceremony?

34:41.958 --> 34:45.040
I thought we took every measure
to secure it.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.541

From someone up here.

[Salo] We can't afford
any more handwringing.

If we do not defend ourselves
with Hextech,

[Caitlyn] We aren't prepared
for a full-scale invasion.

Address me with respect,

35:12.750 --> 35:14.666
or keep your mouth shut.

35:16.875 --> 35:19.833
I will lead a strike team into Zaun
