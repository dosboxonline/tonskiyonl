WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.800
HANK: I still think
about the night

00:03.880 --> 00:05.640
your mother and I
had to leave you.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.480
JANET: Hopefully,
it's not for long,

00:12.560 --> 00:14.480
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.480
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

00:16.640 --> 00:17.520
Mommy?

00:20.640 --> 00:22.240
Jellybean.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.800
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

00:27.000 --> 00:29.240
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.520
No. I don't want you to go.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.720
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.400
I won't be able to keep my...

00:36.880 --> 00:38.000
eyes...

00:38.880 --> 00:40.360
-

00:41.360 --> 00:44.240
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.560
Janet, we gotta go.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.840
-

00:50.640 --> 00:52.920
HANK: I wish we could have
put down our bags...

00:53.080 --> 00:55.200
tucked you back
into your bed...

00:55.600 --> 00:58.600
but too many lives
were at stake.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.800
HANK: Oh, my God.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.600
They've already launched.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.880
JANET: We have to stop it.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
Come on.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.040
HANK: To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...

01:20.200 --> 01:23.000
but the plating was too thick.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.080
The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.000
JANET: I can't get through.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.360
Hank.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.520
HANK: We both knew
that if you go that small...

01:37.680 --> 01:38.760
there is no coming back.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.840
It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.040
Your mother's wasn't.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.160
JANET: Tell Hope I love her.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.600
HANK: She turned it off.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.120
Janet. No!

01:53.680 --> 01:55.680
She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.560
Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day

02:04.760 --> 02:08.200
knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.480
Alone.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.840
Afraid.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.600
Gone forever.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.320
Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...

02:33.080 --> 02:35.760
was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.400
But then Scott showed up.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.040
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.080
And when he went
to the quantum realm...

02:51.720 --> 02:52.760
and came back.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.160
Everything changed.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.040
I started to wonder...

02:59.600 --> 03:01.800
could your mother
still be alive?

03:03.520 --> 03:06.440
So, I dusted off
some old plans.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.160
Dad, what are you saying?

03:19.160 --> 03:22.840
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.840
SCOTT: Okay. We're in.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.120
Oh, this place is a maze.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.160
Where's that map?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.760
We're definitely close.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.720
-You ready?
-I'm ready, Daddy.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.600
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

04:19.680 --> 04:21.880
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.000
I eat fear for breakfast.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.640
Wow. That is super cool.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.880
Come on.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.320
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.360
Anton, which way do we go?

04:40.200 --> 04:42.040
Anton, which way do we go?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.160
Thanks, Anton!

04:52.920 --> 04:55.800
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.680
Oh no, lasers!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.840
Oh! I think I got lased!

05:04.120 --> 05:06.320
The secret vault.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.280
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.120
-Yup.
-

05:12.680 --> 05:15.160
Perfect! Right there.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.520
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

05:21.680 --> 05:23.320
My trophy?

05:23.880 --> 05:25.000
It looks like treasure.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.440
Oh, it is to me.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.000
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.200
Oh, no, you can't do that.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.480
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.720
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

05:34.880 --> 05:35.880
I'm so touched you think

05:35.960 --> 05:37.800
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.280
It was the only one they had.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.160
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.640
Oh, no, the fuzz!

05:44.800 --> 05:45.640
Hey, Scotty...

05:45.800 --> 05:46.840
I was looking
at the schematics

05:46.920 --> 05:48.360
for the
Karapetyan buildings...

05:48.520 --> 05:49.600
and I think we have

05:49.680 --> 05:50.960
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.360
No, no, not at all.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.920
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.240
I know what he needs.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.120
Who's the security expert
in our business?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.080
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.120
And if we overquote him...

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
he's gonna go somewhere else.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.080
I mean,
we gotta land this bird.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.440
He ain't goin' anywhere.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.680
And the expression is
"land this fish."

06:03.880 --> 06:05.280
No, it's "land the bird."

06:05.440 --> 06:06.520
Just like you land the plane.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.680
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.160
I know it's silly
to get hung up

06:09.240 --> 06:10.760
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.080
How am I gonna land a fish?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.120
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

06:14.240 --> 06:16.480
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.640
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.720
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.120
Now, if you just excuse me...

06:23.280 --> 06:23.880
I'm in the middle of trying to

06:23.960 --> 06:24.640
steal something
with my daughter.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.840
I'm gonna go recheck it.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.560
-To the escape ant!

06:29.640 --> 06:32.480
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

06:32.640 --> 06:35.560
SCOTT: The po-po?
How do you even know that?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.720
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

06:39.080 --> 06:41.800
-

06:48.840 --> 06:49.960
Crash landing!

06:50.320 --> 06:51.680
-CASSIE: Whoo!
-

06:53.960 --> 06:55.400
I wish we could shrink
for real.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.080
Oh. That is pretty cool.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.800
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.640
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.880
But I feel
like I'm way better.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.160
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.400
And my hands are shaking.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.520
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.000
It's gonna be great, Luis!

07:08.080 --> 07:09.200
You got nothing
to worry about!

07:09.400 --> 07:11.880
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.240
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.800
-Daddy!

07:20.360 --> 07:23.000
SCOTT: Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.280
Why would I try to escape?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.160
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.840
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.640
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.400
-Thank you.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.680
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.120
Our flying ant crashed.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.480
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
when you can't leave
the house.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.040
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

07:42.240 --> 07:43.880
Close-up magic.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.960
I learned that.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.520
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.680
Oh, Cassie.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.040
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

07:56.160 --> 07:57.640
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

07:57.800 --> 07:59.480
Well, think of it this way.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.360
Your school has rules, right?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.360
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.440
Well, your daddy
went to Germany

08:05.520 --> 08:07.480
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.000
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

08:10.080 --> 08:12.200
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.120
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

08:14.280 --> 08:16.520
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

08:16.720 --> 08:18.400
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

08:18.560 --> 08:20.880
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

08:21.040 --> 08:22.760
followed by three years
of probation.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.720
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

08:25.880 --> 08:28.000
or contact with any
former associates who were...

08:28.160 --> 08:31.400
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.960
Or any related statutes.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.400
Okay, sweetie?

08:35.480 --> 08:37.880
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.920
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.680
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

08:42.840 --> 08:44.160
but you haven't had
any contact

08:44.240 --> 08:45.920
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.520
-No.
-You sure?

08:47.680 --> 08:49.560
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.240
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.240
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.520
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

08:57.720 --> 08:59.400
that any violation
of your agreement

08:59.480 --> 09:01.200
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.840
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.120
They hate his guts.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.000
Thanks, peanut.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.120
How'd you do it, Scott?

09:09.840 --> 09:10.880
Do what?

09:12.080 --> 09:14.000
The card trick.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.640
Seriously?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.800
Oh, my God!

09:17.960 --> 09:20.280
You people
can't just show up here

09:20.360 --> 09:21.920
whenever you want
and search the place.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.120
Actually, they can.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.080
You need a warrant.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.280
Actually, they don't.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.960
Really? Wow.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.200
MAGGIE: Did you pack
your soccer shoes?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.480
-Yeah.
-MAGGIE: All right.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.360
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.120
All right.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.200
Oh, get on the inside of this.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
-

09:39.480 --> 09:41.000
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

09:41.160 --> 09:42.280
-I'm proud of you, bud.
-Thank you.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.800
You know what?
Give me another one.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.040
MAGGIE: Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

09:46.200 --> 09:48.800
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.560
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.640
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
Once I'm outta here,

09:53.880 --> 09:55.080
you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.520
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.400
You're gettin' good at that.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.600
How'd you do that?

10:08.760 --> 10:09.640
CASSIE: Bye, Daddy.
MAGGIE: Bye.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.200
-Bye.
-CASSIE: Bye.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.320
Three days.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.240
Easy-peasy.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.360
Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.360
And that is misdirection.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.440
We had a dream

10:38.520 --> 10:40.160
We'd go travelin' together

10:40.320 --> 10:43.360
We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on

11:12.520 --> 11:15.480
Easy-peasy.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.000
Where are you?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.680
HANK: Everything
that you know...

11:38.400 --> 11:39.680
Lost...

11:39.880 --> 11:42.240
in the quantum realm.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.960
SCOTT: What?

11:51.240 --> 11:53.440
JANET: I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.560
I found you!

12:00.680 --> 12:03.200
You always find me, Mommy.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.560
SCOTT: What the hell?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.600
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.240
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.760
And I'm probably
the last person

12:28.840 --> 12:30.400
you wanna hear from.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.720
But I just had
a really weird dream.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.000
And I know that doesn't

12:35.080 --> 12:36.240
sound like an emergency
or anything...

12:36.400 --> 12:40.560
but it just felt very real.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.240
I was back
in the quantum realm...

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
and I think I saw your wife.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.520
And then I was your wife.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.520
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.040
You know,
hearing this out loud,

12:57.120 --> 12:59.480
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.640
I'm sorry to bother you.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.280
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.560
That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...

13:18.720 --> 13:22.960
Could be one,
little, tiny universe.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.600
-

13:56.880 --> 13:57.720
Hope?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.520
Is this another dream?

14:01.680 --> 14:02.720
Do you think it was a dream...

14:02.880 --> 14:05.480
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

14:06.160 --> 14:07.640
I'm not sure.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.440
I can't be here!

14:12.520 --> 14:14.240
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

14:14.400 --> 14:17.240
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.840
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

14:40.000 --> 14:41.120
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

14:41.200 --> 14:42.320
you're still at home.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.480
Whoa!

14:56.320 --> 14:57.320
Scotty?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.320
HOPE: He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.840
Nine hours in bed.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.160
Five hours in front of the TV.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.440
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.040
That's totally inaccurate.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.840
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

15:07.920 --> 15:08.960
Are you spying on me?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.800
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

15:10.960 --> 15:13.000
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.480
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.520
They said it was
a matter of national security.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.840
That Cap needed help, so...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.240
Cap?

15:24.120 --> 15:27.120
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.080
It's what we call him.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.720
If you're a friend.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.000
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.240
He's nice. Whatever.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.360
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.000
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.640
How's Hank?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.200
How do you think he is?

15:44.360 --> 15:46.200
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.840
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.600
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

15:49.760 --> 15:51.360
because we need
what's in your head.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.120
Is this where you're living?

16:32.800 --> 16:36.520
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

16:36.720 --> 16:38.040
We're fine.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.360
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.360
Save it!

17:42.720 --> 17:43.880
-Can we start?
-HOPE: Yeah.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.400
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

17:47.560 --> 17:49.960
we were building this.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.920
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.200
To my mom.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.480
We think she might still
be down there.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
We just don't know where.

17:57.760 --> 17:58.520
What?

17:59.240 --> 18:01.240
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

18:01.400 --> 18:03.320
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.760
You built all this
and you don't even know

18:04.840 --> 18:06.040
if she's alive?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.120
It's called a hypothesis.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.000
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.280
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.040
But for a split second,

18:15.120 --> 18:18.080
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.040
And?

18:20.240 --> 18:23.320
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.240
We think
when you were down there,

18:25.320 --> 18:26.680
you may have entangled
with her.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.880
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.240
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.640
We think she might have put

18:32.720 --> 18:33.960
some kind of a message
in your head.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.920
Hopefully, a location.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.680
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.440
Your mom put a message
in my head?

18:39.520 --> 18:41.160
Come on. That's insane.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.360
No, Scott.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.880
Insane is going to Germany

18:44.960 --> 18:47.320
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.600
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.560
Tell me
you really destroyed it.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.920
I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.960
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

18:58.920 --> 19:00.480
That was my life's work!

19:00.640 --> 19:01.880
What was I supposed to do?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.800
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
I'm sorry, Hank!

19:06.160 --> 19:07.520
I'm sorry I took the suit.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.800
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.800
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.200
I wish that I did.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.280
I just had a dream about her

19:14.360 --> 19:15.960
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.240
What?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.440
I had a dream.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.240
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.200
Cassie and I do it
all the time.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.560
Doesn't mean anything.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.680
But was it Cassie
in the dream?

19:32.840 --> 19:33.920
No.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.200
Where was she hiding?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.720
-What?
-The little girl.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.920
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

19:39.680 --> 19:42.240
No, it was in a tall dresser.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.520
You mean a wardrobe.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.800
Is that what that's called?

19:45.200 --> 19:46.640
What color was it?

19:47.400 --> 19:48.280
Red.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.000
Were there horses on it?

19:52.520 --> 19:53.640
Oh, boy.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.680
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.360
It doesn't sound like

19:59.440 --> 20:01.480
you really got the gist
of the game.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.720
She's alive.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.080
I knew it.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.360
I knew it!

20:11.920 --> 20:13.280
We need to get that part.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.640
Okay.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.920
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

20:18.080 --> 20:19.560
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
Does Burch have it?

20:20.880 --> 20:22.240
HOPE: Yeah. Let's go.
SCOTT: What part?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.520
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.480
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

20:27.560 --> 20:29.120
from overloading again.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.840
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.280
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

20:44.360 --> 20:45.440
but if I'm not at home
when they come

20:45.520 --> 20:46.560
to take off
my ankle monitor...

20:46.760 --> 20:48.200
then I'm going away forever.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.320
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

20:50.480 --> 20:52.320
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.680
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
You owe us.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.320
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

20:58.520 --> 20:59.840
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.480
Let's go.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.480
-We good?
-Yeah.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.200
I'll be right back.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.840
-Can I have one of these?
-No.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.280
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!

21:59.440 --> 22:01.080
Sonny!

22:01.240 --> 22:03.080
BURCH: Oui is French
for "yes."

22:03.240 --> 22:05.400
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

22:05.560 --> 22:08.160
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.920
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

22:11.000 --> 22:12.640
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

22:15.040 --> 22:17.280
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.520
Have a seat.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.560
No, I'm good. Thank you.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.000
Who is this guy?

22:21.160 --> 22:24.200
HANK: Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.920
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.560
Could I just have one...

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
No.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.800
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.080
And I say "special"...

22:37.240 --> 22:40.040
because, well,
he tells me things

22:40.120 --> 22:41.760
that I didn't previously know.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.040
For example...

22:44.200 --> 22:46.000
your name isn't Susan.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.400
It's Hope Van Dyne.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.840
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.120
-That's not good, Hank.
-No shit.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.720
What do you want?

23:03.880 --> 23:06.040
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.640
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.880
Our relationship?

23:10.040 --> 23:12.800
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.760
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

23:14.920 --> 23:16.840
but now, Hank Pym...

23:17.040 --> 23:19.360
Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.600
Do you have a point?

23:20.760 --> 23:21.960
Oh, you think
that I don't know

23:22.040 --> 23:24.400
what you've been building
with all this?

23:24.560 --> 23:26.560
Quantum technology.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.600
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

23:29.680 --> 23:30.880
forget cryptocurrency.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.640
Quantum energy is the future.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.480
It's the next gold rush.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.640
Is that so?

23:35.800 --> 23:37.200
I want in, Hope.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.840
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

23:40.000 --> 23:42.080
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

23:42.720 --> 23:43.840
Starting bid...

23:44.520 --> 23:47.600
one billion dollars.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.360
Thank you, Sonny, really.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.720
But my father and I
have something

23:50.800 --> 23:53.240
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.520
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.880
BURCH: My buyers don't take no
for an answer.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.800
So, we are
either in business together...

24:02.280 --> 24:04.760
or we aren't
in business together.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.600
Then I guess we aren't.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.600
You can go.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.520
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.640
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.760
Listen, Sonny.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.680
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

24:22.760 --> 24:24.280
if you just give me
that component.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.320
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

24:26.520 --> 24:30.120
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.920
Okay.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.840
So, now what?

24:43.040 --> 24:44.120
You'll see.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.760
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.040
-Mmm-hmm.
-I want to know what it is

24:48.120 --> 24:49.200
because if they're not working
with us...

24:49.360 --> 24:50.840
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.120
I want some names...

24:56.800 --> 24:58.560
Hold on, you gave her wings?

25:04.960 --> 25:05.800
Get her.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.720
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

25:28.200 --> 25:29.920
Stop firing! Stop!

25:34.480 --> 25:36.000
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

25:36.440 --> 25:37.600
Go!

26:40.160 --> 26:41.760
Wings and blasters.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.800
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.800
No, I did.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.240
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.920
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.720
I can assure you of that!

27:01.160 --> 27:03.040
What in the hell is that?

27:16.920 --> 27:18.360
THE WASP: Dad,
are you seeing this?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.440
Hope, get out of there!

27:28.120 --> 27:29.720
-I gotta do something.
-Wait!

27:35.360 --> 27:38.360
It is still
a work in progress.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.120
ANT-MAN: You taught me
that kick. Remember?

27:58.320 --> 27:59.480
THE WASP: Yeah, great form.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.440
ANT-MAN: Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

28:01.600 --> 28:02.720
THE WASP: Not the time, Scott.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
Damn it, where'd it go?

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
I've lost it.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.120
HANK: I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.000
-Try looking...
-

28:12.360 --> 28:13.200
THE WASP: Dad?

28:21.680 --> 28:23.440
Give me that.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.480
Now.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.240
-Are you okay?
-No!

28:30.480 --> 28:31.440
He got the lab.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.360
No.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
Come on!

28:36.000 --> 28:37.120
What was that?

28:37.360 --> 28:38.600
I don't know.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.600
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

28:40.680 --> 28:42.520
and figure out
where the lab is.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.480
So, where to now?

28:44.840 --> 28:46.480
How about my house? Hmm?

28:46.640 --> 28:47.720
I'm supposed
to be there anyway,

28:47.800 --> 28:48.840
and Woo could walk in
any second.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.240
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.600
What about your house?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.480
Sorry.

28:55.640 --> 28:58.360
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
No.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.160
No, no, no, no!

29:05.040 --> 29:05.920
No!

29:09.280 --> 29:10.480
LUIS: Wow, Dr. Pym...

29:10.680 --> 29:12.000
who would've thought that,

29:12.080 --> 29:13.360
once again,
in your hour of need...

29:13.560 --> 29:15.560
that you would turn to us,
you know?

29:15.760 --> 29:16.680
Not me.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.040
Mmm. Help yourself.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.360
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

29:20.480 --> 29:21.840
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.720
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

29:23.920 --> 29:24.960
The oatmeal packets.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.680
Oatmeal packets.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.440
-It's insult.
-Why is it an insult?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.680
Because it tastes like sand.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.120
LUIS: You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.480
It's not organic, it's sand.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.760
It's the most important meal
of the day.

29:33.920 --> 29:34.720
LUIS: You know what,
you can get creative with it.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.840
Break teeth.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.160
Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.320
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

29:38.520 --> 29:41.400
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.200
We got bigger fish to fry.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.840
Is that my desk?

29:44.960 --> 29:46.560
-LUIS: Yeah.
-What?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.160
Why do I have
such a small desk?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.800
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

29:49.960 --> 29:50.960
You snooze, you lose.

29:51.160 --> 29:51.960
Well, I was
under house arrest.

29:52.040 --> 29:52.800
Yeah.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.040
SCOTT: You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.040
This is garbage.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.840
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.160
I got it at a rummage sale.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.800
SCOTT: So, you save money
on my desk?

30:00.960 --> 30:01.840
Guys.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.080
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.440
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.960
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

30:09.040 --> 30:09.960
like what happened to you.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.200
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.080
Like a ghost.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.720
Like Baba Yaga.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.360
Baba Yaga, the witch.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.240
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.840
You know Baba Yaga?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.240
HOPE: Whoever stole it...

30:29.440 --> 30:30.840
we need to find it.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.440
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.360
Like Baba Yaga.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.240
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.760
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

30:41.960 --> 30:43.040
Because if you didn't,

30:43.120 --> 30:45.080
we have a variety
of affordable options.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.640
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.280
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.400
They also looked like
they were phasing.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.600
Phasing?

30:54.760 --> 30:56.320
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

30:56.400 --> 30:57.640
through different states
of matter.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.640
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.880
The lab emits radiation.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.600
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

31:03.760 --> 31:06.360
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.480
Where else can we find
that equipment?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.240
Well, there is one person.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.640
Bill Foster.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.800
Great!

31:16.000 --> 31:17.360
Who's Bill Foster?

31:17.560 --> 31:19.640
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.520
They had a falling out
years ago.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.360
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.560
It's probably
just a waste of time.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.680
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.040
Don't you think
we should check?

31:29.280 --> 31:31.520
We need to find out
who took the lab.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.520
SCOTT: Guys,
it's not a good idea

32:25.600 --> 32:27.040
to be out in the open
like this.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.040
HANK: Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.560
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

32:32.760 --> 32:34.200
That's not a disguise, Hank.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.480
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.560
BILL: In an isolated system...

32:38.720 --> 32:43.240
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.600
If the system
is interfered with,

32:45.680 --> 32:48.880
that stability becomes chaos.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.840
Unpredictable.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.400
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.920
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

32:56.000 --> 32:58.360
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

32:58.520 --> 33:02.160
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.880
In other words,
the object in question

33:04.960 --> 33:06.600
would be both
in and out of phase...

33:06.760 --> 33:10.000
with multiple
parallel realities.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.560
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.440
I am noticing
an unusually high number

33:21.520 --> 33:23.840
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.880
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

33:28.040 --> 33:29.200
That'll be enough for today.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.040
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.800
BILL: It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.920
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

33:39.000 --> 33:40.800
Posner molecules
in your brains.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.400
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.560
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

33:44.640 --> 33:45.520
in front of everything?

33:45.680 --> 33:47.400
Doctor, we need to
find our lab.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.960
Hope, I'd love to help you...

33:49.160 --> 33:49.720
but I don't have anything

33:49.840 --> 33:50.560
like the equipment
you're describing.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.840
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.080
BILL: Don't condescend, Hank.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.280
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.280
All because
you had to grow to a size

33:58.360 --> 34:00.080
that finally fit your ego.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.600
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

34:03.760 --> 34:04.640
Really?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.320
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.760
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.000
Actually, I do.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.880
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

34:13.960 --> 34:15.720
on a project called Goliath.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.280
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

34:17.400 --> 34:19.360
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

34:19.440 --> 34:21.360
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.840
-Right...
-

34:24.400 --> 34:27.120
I don't know.
How big did you get?

34:27.400 --> 34:30.040
My record? 21 feet.

34:30.160 --> 34:31.600
-Not bad.
-You?

34:31.880 --> 34:32.600
I don't...

34:32.800 --> 34:33.760
No, really, I'm curious.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.400
-65 feet. Yeah.
-Whoa!

34:36.600 --> 34:38.240
-Huge.
-65.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.800
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

34:40.920 --> 34:43.120
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.280
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

34:46.400 --> 34:48.120
-Strange.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.040
You had all the answers
back in the day.

34:50.160 --> 34:51.560
That's why I left the project.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.680
Left? I fired you.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.000
BILL: Best decision
I ever made.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.320
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

34:57.440 --> 34:59.520
stubborn, impatient.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.640
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.200
Just the mediocrities.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.400
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

35:05.480 --> 35:06.560
and chose to stick it out.

35:06.680 --> 35:07.640
Watch it, Bill.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.240
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

35:09.400 --> 35:10.520
You son of a bitch.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.880
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.440
I'm trying to save my mother.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.440
Now, which office
would you say?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.440
Oh, it's Woo.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.840
Someone must have seen me.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.200
Relax. If this is about you,

35:22.280 --> 35:24.080
they'd be in your house
by now.

35:26.680 --> 35:27.680
What are you, 15?

35:27.840 --> 35:28.880
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.040
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

35:32.520 --> 35:33.640
if you modify
the diffraction units

35:33.720 --> 35:34.800
on one of your regulators.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.280
-That could work.
-I don't know what that means.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.440
Thank you. Thank you.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.320
But, Doctor,
campus police says

35:52.400 --> 35:54.200
they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.640
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.680
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.920
I can assure you
I'm the last person

35:59.000 --> 36:00.040
he would want to visit.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.280
Oh, come on,
you expect us to...

36:01.360 --> 36:01.960
WOO: Hey, hey.

36:02.720 --> 36:03.720
Why is that?

36:04.320 --> 36:07.200
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.560
HANK:
So I'm a terrible partner?

36:09.720 --> 36:12.080
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

36:12.160 --> 36:13.360
in his unremarkable career.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.480
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

36:15.680 --> 36:17.440
Fine, one decent idea.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.480
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

36:19.560 --> 36:21.440
when I upgraded the suits.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.080
So, if we had an old suit,

36:26.160 --> 36:28.240
we might be able
to track down the lab?

36:28.400 --> 36:29.720
Yes, but we don't.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.840
-What if we did?
-HOPE: What do you mean?

36:35.240 --> 36:36.360
I mean...

36:37.560 --> 36:38.600
life's funny.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.720
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

36:40.880 --> 36:41.760
What?

36:41.880 --> 36:44.120
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.760
I couldn't destroy that.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.320
Before I turned myself in,

36:48.400 --> 36:49.600
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.080
You sent my suit
through the mail?

36:52.520 --> 36:54.240
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.640
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

36:57.840 --> 36:58.840
Where is it?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.400
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.280
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.760
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

37:05.960 --> 37:07.360
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.720
-Hey, get away from the plant.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.840
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

37:12.040 --> 37:13.520
Show-and-tell.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.640
Scotty?

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
No, stop!

37:18.400 --> 37:20.640
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.280
ANT-MAN: Whenever you go
back to school...

37:28.480 --> 37:30.160
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

37:30.360 --> 37:31.800
This place seems huge.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.000
What is it?

37:33.080 --> 37:34.160
THE WASP:
It's the new regulator.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.200
ANT-MAN: Hank, what's going on
with this suit?

37:36.280 --> 37:37.920
How much of
a work in progress is this?

37:39.440 --> 37:42.560
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
THE WASP: Oh.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.760
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

37:56.960 --> 37:58.400
THE WASP: Okay, okay.

38:01.840 --> 38:02.840
HANK: What do you see?

38:02.960 --> 38:05.080
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.560
Just let me...

38:06.720 --> 38:08.440
-SCOTT: Ow!
-

38:10.320 --> 38:11.400
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.400
Okay.
All right.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.320
Try that.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.480
Sorry.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.480
What?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.320
Awesome.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.440
If only Cap could see you now.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

38:45.440 --> 38:46.840
TEACHER: Hey!

38:47.000 --> 38:48.120
Where's your hall pass?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.600
Hey, I'm talking to you.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.320
Hey!

38:55.720 --> 38:57.320
Hey. Eh...

39:21.960 --> 39:23.880
THE WASP: You can do it.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.120
You almost got it.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.040
Oh, peanut.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.000
Okay, let's go.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.200
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

40:13.440 --> 40:15.720
All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?

40:15.920 --> 40:17.320
So cranky.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.080
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

40:20.160 --> 40:22.200
-Do you really have that?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.440
HANK: Let's see
if Foster was right.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.400
This has gotta be the lab.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.360
Let's go get it.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.720
Yeah.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.480
This seems right.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.840
Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.480
Makes you think, huh?

41:11.640 --> 41:12.680
About what?

41:12.840 --> 41:14.520
Germany.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.560
What do you mean?

41:15.720 --> 41:18.400
We were working together,
training together...

41:18.560 --> 41:21.040
and other stuffing together.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.520
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.240
I guess we'll never know.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.960
But I do know one thing.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.040
What?

41:28.200 --> 41:30.960
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.120
Hey, Scott.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.560
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

41:42.640 --> 41:44.120
long enough to get my lab?

41:44.280 --> 41:46.120
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.320
Okay, you're transmitting.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.560
THE WASP:
What took you so long?

41:54.720 --> 41:57.120
ANT-MAN: Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.560
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.040
You like it?

42:01.200 --> 42:02.360
THE WASP: Hilarious.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.160
HANK: I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.480
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

42:07.760 --> 42:08.600
Be careful.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.280
ANT-MAN: You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

42:11.760 --> 42:13.160
THE WASP: It's okay.
It's just the suit.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.920
ANT-MAN: How do you know?
THE WASP: Look.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.880
ANT-MAN: That's Ghost?

42:20.040 --> 42:21.320
THE WASP: What is she doing?

42:21.520 --> 42:22.600
ANT-MAN: Do you think
that suit is how

42:22.680 --> 42:24.480
she goes through walls
and stuff?

42:24.800 --> 42:26.520
THE WASP: Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.840
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

42:36.600 --> 42:37.560
and not
somebody else's, right?

42:37.720 --> 42:39.840
THE WASP: Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.080
I'll get it.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.200
Hope. Hope! Hank.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.120
Guys.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.480
I don't think
they can hear you.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.320
Hi.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.440
I'm Ava.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.080
Scott.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.080
So, you don't need the suit...

43:18.160 --> 43:19.960
to go through things.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.760
No.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.640
It just helps me control it.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.880
And the pain, supposedly.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.720
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

43:36.800 --> 43:38.120
and crush my heart, are you?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.320
You're funny.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.200
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.640
I need...

43:54.800 --> 43:56.800
what's in your head.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.160
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

44:12.240 --> 44:13.480
and get this over with,
shall we?

44:16.480 --> 44:17.520
Get up!

44:18.320 --> 44:19.320
Come on!

44:22.120 --> 44:23.200
-Dad?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.440
Don't ever touch him again.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.000
Now, now, Hope...

44:30.040 --> 44:31.600
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

44:31.680 --> 44:32.880
all things considered.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.600
What the hell
are you talking about?

44:36.520 --> 44:39.800
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.160
Bill.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.360
What have you done?

44:45.640 --> 44:48.360
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.240
You're with her?

44:50.400 --> 44:52.640
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.400
What the hell
is going on here?

44:54.800 --> 44:57.040
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.480
Why would he?

44:59.640 --> 45:01.760
Elihas Starr.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.080
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.560
Quantum research.

45:07.400 --> 45:11.320
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.160
You had him fired.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.440
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.880
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.160
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

45:27.320 --> 45:28.320
No, no, no!

45:29.360 --> 45:30.360
Too many.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.520
Until something went wrong.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.040
He told us to run.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.040
Elihas, what's happening?

45:37.200 --> 45:38.600
Just go. Go!

45:38.800 --> 45:41.000
Daddy! Daddy!

45:41.160 --> 45:42.440
AVA: I could tell
he was scared.

45:48.040 --> 45:48.880
Daddy!

45:49.040 --> 45:50.120
Ava, no!

45:53.360 --> 45:55.160
AVA: I didn't want him
to be alone.

45:56.640 --> 45:57.920
No! No!

46:05.680 --> 46:07.920
When I woke up,
my parents were dead.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.400
I wasn't so lucky.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.200
AVA: They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."

46:21.280 --> 46:23.240
A rather dull name, I think.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.280
Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.

46:26.840 --> 46:30.560
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

46:30.720 --> 46:32.240
and stitched back together.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.760
Over and over.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.560
Every day.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.960
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

46:40.040 --> 46:42.760
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

46:46.000 --> 46:46.920
Hello, Ava.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.680
My name's Bill.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.320
I was a friend
of your father's.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.760
I brought you something.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.440
It's all right.
Try again.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.240
That's it.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.280
AVA: Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.440
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

47:10.520 --> 47:13.160
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.000
They built me
a containment suit,

47:18.080 --> 47:19.640
so I could control my phasing.

47:20.440 --> 47:22.120
And trained me
to be a stealth operative.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.520
They weaponized me.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.440
I stole for them.
Spied for them.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.560
Killed for them.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.160
And in exchange for my soul...

47:33.440 --> 47:35.200
they were going to cure me.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.280
They lied.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.840
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.000
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

47:46.080 --> 47:47.240
but her condition
was progressive.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.040
-I didn't know how to cure it.
-

47:50.200 --> 47:52.880
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

47:53.040 --> 47:54.240
and that she should
watch you instead.

47:54.400 --> 47:55.880
And sure enough,
she discovered

47:55.960 --> 47:57.200
that you were
building the tunnel.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.360
Then, she told me about Lang.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.960
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

48:04.040 --> 48:05.440
-that's when I...
-

48:05.600 --> 48:06.600
Christ's sake!

48:06.760 --> 48:08.120
That's me. I'm sorry.

48:08.240 --> 48:09.800
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

48:10.880 --> 48:12.560
"Cassie, 911."

48:12.720 --> 48:14.640
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.080
No, that's not happening.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.120
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.920
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

48:20.120 --> 48:22.080
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

48:23.320 --> 48:24.880
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.840
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.040
-

48:30.400 --> 48:32.200
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

48:32.360 --> 48:34.080
I can't find my soccer shoes.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.200
What?

48:35.360 --> 48:36.440
I have a game tomorrow.

48:36.640 --> 48:37.680
MAGGIE: Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.200
Can you just walk the phone
around the house?

48:39.360 --> 48:40.760
No, I can't do that right now.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.680
-Why not?
-Because I'm sick.

48:42.840 --> 48:43.880
MAGGIE: Hey, can you just
maybe look around

48:43.960 --> 48:44.880
later then and call me back?

48:45.040 --> 48:46.400
Please? Thank you.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.760
Bye, Daddy!

48:47.920 --> 48:49.680
-Bye, peanut!
-Feel better!

48:49.840 --> 48:50.840
Feel better, buddy!

48:51.200 --> 48:53.720
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.720
Ava, I want to help you.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.880
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

48:58.080 --> 48:59.280
Oh, really? How?

48:59.440 --> 49:00.440
Janet.

49:00.640 --> 49:02.080
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

49:02.160 --> 49:03.160
absorbing quantum energy.

49:03.320 --> 49:04.680
We can extract that energy.

49:04.880 --> 49:07.160
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

49:07.320 --> 49:08.160
Extract it?

49:08.320 --> 49:09.400
-Yes.
-Are you insane?

49:09.560 --> 49:11.160
That would rip Janet apart.

49:11.320 --> 49:14.160
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

49:14.320 --> 49:15.600
When Janet's location

49:15.720 --> 49:17.040
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

49:17.200 --> 49:19.000
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

49:19.160 --> 49:19.840
What?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.760
BILL: You are gonna
stay here...

49:21.920 --> 49:23.920
just in case I need your help.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.240
Like hell I would help you!

49:26.440 --> 49:27.600
You'll do whatever I say.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.800
HANK: You're gonna kill Janet!

49:28.960 --> 49:30.800
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.360
-HOPE: Dad?
-Calm down, Hank.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.240
So help me God...

49:38.240 --> 49:38.920
The pills.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.600
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.640
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.400
He could die!

49:46.560 --> 49:47.600
Come on!

49:47.760 --> 49:48.600
Help him!

49:49.040 --> 49:50.360
HOPE: Dad, just hang on,
all right?

49:50.440 --> 49:51.760
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

49:51.920 --> 49:53.200
Help him, man! Come on!

49:53.360 --> 49:54.240
HOPE: The Altoid tin!

49:56.520 --> 49:57.400
Wait!

50:01.680 --> 50:02.680
-Thanks, guys.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.640
Hank!

50:16.520 --> 50:19.160
HANK: Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.520
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.080
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.760
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.680
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

50:30.880 --> 50:31.840
Good job.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.240
It'll work.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.400
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.760
Look, we'll adjust the relays

50:36.840 --> 50:38.640
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

50:38.800 --> 50:40.400
It's going to be fine.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.280
SCOTT: So, this is it.

50:47.480 --> 50:49.440
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

50:49.520 --> 50:51.040
to prepare I'd be more ready.

50:51.200 --> 50:54.120
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.680
It kind of melts your mind.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.680
I mean seeing my mom again.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.000
Oh.

51:01.640 --> 51:03.880
What if she's a completely
different person?

51:04.080 --> 51:06.480
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.040
I'm serious, Scott.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.240
Or George Jefferson.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.120
What if she's forgotten
about me?

51:15.360 --> 51:17.320
When I was in prison...

51:17.480 --> 51:20.040
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

51:20.200 --> 51:21.440
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

51:21.600 --> 51:22.960
I never would have
forgotten her.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.240
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

51:27.320 --> 51:29.280
until she can see you again.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.040
Thank you.

51:39.600 --> 51:40.400
Hey.

51:40.560 --> 51:41.880
We got a big problem.

51:42.080 --> 51:42.960
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

51:43.040 --> 51:43.840
on the back of the building.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.480
Oh, no.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.160
And they're on the proposal,

51:47.240 --> 51:48.720
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

51:48.880 --> 51:52.280
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.000
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.040
No. No, no, no, no.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.360
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

51:57.440 --> 51:58.600
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.040
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.200
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.800
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.240
And you can fix them there.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.640
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

52:07.800 --> 52:08.720
It's complicated.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.160
What do you mean
it's complicated?

52:14.240 --> 52:16.320
As you can see, sir,

52:16.400 --> 52:18.440
this system
is state of the art.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.840
Security of tomorrow, today.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.200
Oh, that's so good!

52:22.280 --> 52:23.840
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

52:24.000 --> 52:24.960
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

52:25.040 --> 52:25.960
so we can fix the plans.

52:26.160 --> 52:27.560
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.040
-DAVE: As you can see...
-Oh, oh, oh!

52:30.800 --> 52:32.480
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.200
Down to the undercarriage,
baby.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.680
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

52:35.880 --> 52:37.080
Well, you said get the works.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.320
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

52:39.480 --> 52:40.640
BURCH: He's right.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.520
The undercarriage wash,

52:43.600 --> 52:45.120
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

52:45.280 --> 52:48.480
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

52:48.680 --> 52:49.840
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

52:49.920 --> 52:51.120
about car wash protocol?

52:52.040 --> 52:53.640
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

52:53.800 --> 52:56.320
And I do my research, Luis.

52:57.560 --> 53:00.840
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

53:01.000 --> 53:02.640
at the FBI that you are

53:02.720 --> 53:04.360
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

53:04.520 --> 53:07.480
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

53:07.640 --> 53:10.280
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

53:10.440 --> 53:12.800
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.640
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.320
Well, I hate to
break it to you,

53:17.400 --> 53:19.520
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.600
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.680
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.680
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.200
Now...

53:32.360 --> 53:34.200
Uzman is a master

53:34.280 --> 53:36.320
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

53:36.520 --> 53:37.960
through psychoactive means.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.320
Oh, is that truth serum?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.880
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.400
That's just nonsense from TV.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.200
Well, what is it then?

53:47.360 --> 53:48.920
It's a little concoction

53:49.040 --> 53:51.720
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

53:51.880 --> 53:54.760
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.000
Well, dude,
that's truth serum.

53:56.080 --> 53:56.800
No, it's not.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.200
-Right?
-It's not a truth serum.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.680
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.080
ANITOLOV:
It's not a truth serum.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.560
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

54:08.720 --> 54:09.760
The truth serum.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.680
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

54:11.840 --> 54:13.680
so you might wanna think
about that.

54:16.680 --> 54:18.320
We've got to get
that lab back.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.560
AVA: What?

54:21.560 --> 54:23.880
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.280
How long have I got?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.160
A couple of weeks, maybe.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.720
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

54:36.880 --> 54:37.840
How?

54:39.040 --> 54:41.280
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

54:41.440 --> 54:42.480
You can't mean that.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.040
Ava!

54:45.960 --> 54:47.840
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

54:48.000 --> 54:49.840
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.520
You're not the one who's about

54:51.640 --> 54:53.360
to fade away
into nothing, Bill.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.600
I am!

54:55.280 --> 54:57.240
You said you could fix me!

54:59.840 --> 55:01.600
You promised.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.600
I know. I will.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.040
But not like that.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.640
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

55:10.160 --> 55:12.600
I won't help you.
And we're done.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.840
Fine.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.800
There are other options.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.840
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.200
Because I don't feel anything.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.080
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.120
This is truth serum!

55:43.280 --> 55:44.240
There's no such thing!

55:44.440 --> 55:45.960
Okay.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.320
Okay, okay.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.760
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.360
Okay.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.480
Where is Scott Lang?

55:57.920 --> 55:59.040
Well, see, that's complicated.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.000
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.600
And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.280
His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...

56:04.440 --> 56:06.360
"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"

56:06.520 --> 56:07.480
And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.480
"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...

56:08.720 --> 56:09.600
"but now I'm all alone."

56:09.800 --> 56:10.840
And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?

56:11.000 --> 56:12.240
"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.680
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

56:13.840 --> 56:14.920
And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,

56:15.000 --> 56:16.040
"and we're gonna be
best friends."

56:16.200 --> 56:17.080
BURCH: Okay, hold on, hold on.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.800
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

56:18.960 --> 56:20.120
but what in the hell
does this have to do

56:20.200 --> 56:21.360
with where Scott Lang is?

56:21.560 --> 56:22.400
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.800
You put a dime in him,

56:23.880 --> 56:25.080
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.960
He like human jukebox.

56:27.120 --> 56:28.800
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

56:28.960 --> 56:31.200
-Yeah, only played Morrissey.
-

56:31.360 --> 56:32.800
And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...

56:34.000 --> 56:35.480
You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."

56:35.640 --> 56:36.600
Then, ¡adios!

56:36.760 --> 56:38.160
What can I say?
We relate to his

56:38.240 --> 56:39.560
melancholy ballads,
you know?

56:39.720 --> 56:41.000
-Lang!
-Right, right, right.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.200
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

56:42.280 --> 56:43.240
and he starts working
for Hank.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.560
That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...

56:44.720 --> 56:46.080
"I want nothing to do
with you.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.760
"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."

56:47.960 --> 56:48.920
And then Scotty's, like,

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.200
"And I'll probably
never find love again,

56:51.280 --> 56:52.400
"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"

56:52.560 --> 56:53.520
But then you fast forward

56:53.600 --> 56:54.560
and they're all
into each other, right?

56:54.760 --> 56:55.640
And then Scotty's, like,

56:55.720 --> 56:56.960
"You know what?
I can't tell you this...

56:57.120 --> 56:59.040
"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."

56:59.200 --> 57:00.800
And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!

57:00.960 --> 57:02.400
"Smell you later, dummy."

57:02.600 --> 57:03.640
So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.280
And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...

57:05.480 --> 57:06.880
"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been

57:06.960 --> 57:08.720
"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"

57:08.880 --> 57:09.880
But fate brought 'em
back together.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.000
And then Hope's heart
is all...

57:11.200 --> 57:12.760
"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...

57:12.920 --> 57:14.520
"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"

57:14.680 --> 57:15.880
And then
my heart is all, like...

57:16.080 --> 57:17.800
"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red

57:18.000 --> 57:19.680
"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"

57:19.840 --> 57:20.680
"Out of business"?

57:20.840 --> 57:21.720
"Days away"?

57:21.920 --> 57:22.880
Damn truth serum!

57:23.040 --> 57:25.080
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

57:25.240 --> 57:27.120
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

57:27.280 --> 57:28.120
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.120
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

57:29.280 --> 57:30.400
That's terrible bossing!

57:30.560 --> 57:31.440
Damn, bro!

57:31.600 --> 57:32.600
-That's on me! That's on me!
-BURCH: Hey!

57:33.760 --> 57:35.360
Enough.

57:37.680 --> 57:39.520
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

57:40.760 --> 57:42.200
Where is Scott Lang?

57:42.360 --> 57:43.320
I've been trying to tell you,

57:43.440 --> 57:44.400
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

57:44.560 --> 57:45.880
Emotionally speaking.

57:46.040 --> 57:49.080
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

57:49.280 --> 57:50.520
Oh!
The woods.

57:50.680 --> 57:51.720
-The woods?
-

57:52.120 --> 57:53.440
Baba Yaga!

57:54.480 --> 57:56.160
What do you mean, "the woods"?

57:56.320 --> 57:57.400
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

57:57.480 --> 57:58.600
off the Panoramic Highway!

57:58.760 --> 57:59.880
For God's sake!

58:01.840 --> 58:03.560
Baba Yaga, come at night

58:03.720 --> 58:06.000
Little children, sleepy tight

58:08.280 --> 58:09.920
Damn it!

58:11.560 --> 58:12.960
If that freak
gets Pym's tech...

58:13.120 --> 58:14.640
I'm never gonna see it.

58:14.840 --> 58:15.880
So, what do we do now?

58:17.280 --> 58:18.920
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

58:19.000 --> 58:20.320
than from the boogeyman.

58:22.840 --> 58:25.920
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

58:26.080 --> 58:29.800
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.200
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

58:31.280 --> 58:33.040
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.280
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.560
Understood.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.360
Good news, gentlemen.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.720
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

58:43.400 --> 58:45.280
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

58:45.440 --> 58:46.280
KNOX: Right.

58:48.480 --> 58:50.880
-STOLTZ: Sir.
-Can you knock?

58:51.560 --> 58:54.080
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

58:55.320 --> 58:57.200
Ooh, I love leads.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.000
System's in the green.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.760
Priming the coils.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.160
HOPE: Full charge.

59:10.320 --> 59:11.360
As soon
as the tunnel's open...

59:11.520 --> 59:12.600
let us know
if you get anything

59:12.680 --> 59:13.640
that could be a part of
her message.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.120
Yeah, yeah. I will.

59:17.320 --> 59:18.800
HANK: Okay, then.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.440
Here it goes.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.920
We did it!

59:38.440 --> 59:39.960
You got anything?

59:43.160 --> 59:44.080
Nothin'.

59:44.600 --> 59:46.960
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

59:48.280 --> 59:49.640
No.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.360
No, no, no, no!

59:51.560 --> 59:52.440
What's happening?

59:52.600 --> 59:54.320
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.760
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

59:56.920 --> 59:57.840
HOPE: Then what else
could it be?

59:58.000 --> 59:59.800
-HANK: I don't know!
-

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:07.240
-Scott, what are you doing?
-Scott, get away from that!

1:00:07.400 --> 1:00:08.280
Scott, you can't...

1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:10.120
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:11.480
I need to fix the algorithm.

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:16.040
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:17.880
I've thought about it a lot.

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:23.360
Janet?

1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:27.640
Hi, honey.

1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:32.560
Jellybean.

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:34.320
Mom?

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:36.960
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:38.880
It's all so rushed.

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:41.360
You two have done
such great work.

1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:43.480
You just need a little...

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:45.200
nudge.

1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:02.920
HANK: Janet,
how is this possible?

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:05.880
It wasn't a message you put

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.280
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.000
Clever girl.

1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:11.520
-I'm so proud of you.
-

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:13.360
Honey, tell us where you are.

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.120
Tell us how to find you.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.120
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:18.640
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:20.240
You have to follow my voice.

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:21.720
Of course!

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:23.760
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:31.840
HANK: I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:34.280
between point two
and point nine.

1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:36.000
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:37.280
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:39.040
Look at us squabbling again.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.600
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:46.160
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:02.320
-Bullseye.

1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.040
Source lock.

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.720
It's you.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:07.920
We got it!

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.640
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.320
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:14.640
It's very dangerous,

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:16.760
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:19.480
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.040
You have two hours.

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:22.880
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:24.000
and it'll be another century

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:25.520
before they align
like this again.

1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:27.720
HOPE: We'll find you.

1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.560
I know you will, Jellybean.

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:42.600
Nope.

1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:44.600
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:45.800
Perfect.

1:02:47.800 --> 1:02:49.280
How did we get up here?

1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:55.840
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:57.160
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.040
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1:03:00.240 --> 1:03:01.640
Scott, I'll be fine.

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:03.320
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:04.840
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.880
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.440
Hey, man, you coming?

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:14.200
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:16.480
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:17.880
-What?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:19.280
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:20.240
And then all of a sudden

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.520
I started talkin'
all honestly.

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.280
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:24.600
I hate it, I hate it.

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:25.600
-Uh...
-But you need to go home...

1:03:25.760 --> 1:03:27.240
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:28.280
And by the way...

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:31.040
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:42.080
I feel like such a jerk.

1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:44.560
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.640
What?

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:47.880
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:49.120
How?

1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:51.200
-I told Luis where we are.
-You what?

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:52.360
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:53.600
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:54.840
Oh, my God!

1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:57.000
Look, we need
to land that account.

1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:58.280
Otherwise,
we lose the business!

1:03:58.480 --> 1:03:59.320
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:00.240
to find work these days?

1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:01.800
Jesus, Scott!

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:12.920
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.840
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:15.720
I know!

1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.360
I'm really sorry...

1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:20.680
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:22.320
I have to go.

1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:25.760
Can I borrow the suit?

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:28.640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:30.520
Powering on.

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.640
I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.040
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:36.760
-Don't bother.
-What?

1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:38.000
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:39.160
as soon as we've found my mom.

1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:41.520
-Hope...
-Scott, just go!

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.680
-Scott?
-Daddy?

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:01.960
It's us, buddy!

1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:04.320
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:05.880
He must be resting.

1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:07.120
Honey, why don't you
go upstairs

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:08.280
and look under your bed?

1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:10.600
Daddy, you upstairs?

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:13.200
Daddy?

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:15.400
PAXTON: What the...

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.160
MAGGIE: He really lives
like a pig these days.

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:23.560
Daddy?

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:32.800
-Spread out!
-

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:34.040
Again?

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:35.520
You people have no shame!

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.520
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:38.640
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:43.360
Cassie, let the man get by!

1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:45.080
But Daddy's super sick!

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:46.440
I'll see about that!

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:48.480
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:49.920
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.280
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:53.920
Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.080
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1:05:56.880 --> 1:05:57.880
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1:05:58.040 --> 1:05:59.760
-Yes!
-Forget it, move aside!

1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:01.160
CASSIE: No!

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.680
-Woo!

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:10.440
-What are you doing here?
-Scott.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:14.600
I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:15.880
I told you.

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:17.360
SCOTT: Excuse me.

1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.000
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:21.480
Sorry.

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:29.680
HANK: I'll start the van.

1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:32.040
You get the lab.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:36.360
AGENT: Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:51.880
Hank Pym...

1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:53.480
Hope Van Dyne...

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:54.800
you're under arrest.

1:06:56.800 --> 1:06:57.680
This is harassment!

1:06:57.840 --> 1:06:58.960
Actually, it's not.

1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:00.600
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.160
"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:06.640
-WOO: His monitor check out?
-Of course it does.

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:08.520
Damn it!

1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:11.080
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:13.320
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:15.680
Seriously? Yes!

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:18.720
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:20.480
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:22.920
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:24.600
Anyway, I'll be back later

1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:25.960
for the official end
of your sentence!

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.040
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.240
You should feel great
about yourself!

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:55.120
AGENT 1: What is it?

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:56.240
AGENT 2: We have a man down.

1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:58.160
And Pym's lab is gone.

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.440
SCOTT: Hey.

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.000
Thanks for covering for me.

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:12.200
Sure.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:16.240
So...

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:19.520
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:24.760
Not long.

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:26.600
It just sort of happened.

1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:28.440
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:30.320
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:31.400
Daddy, it's okay.

1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:32.680
It's not.

1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:35.120
I do some dumb things...

1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:37.560
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:38.760
Mainly you.

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:41.160
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:45.640
I screw it up
just about every time.

1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:49.000
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:50.400
like a partner.

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:51.520
Well, she's made it clear

1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:52.920
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:54.200
Who?

1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:55.680
Hope.

1:08:58.080 --> 1:08:59.440
Wait, who did you think?

1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:00.480
Me.

1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:03.720
Don't laugh.

1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:05.560
I'd be a great partner.

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.440
Aw, peanut.

1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:11.800
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.200
I would be a terrible dad.

1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:15.880
Fine.

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:18.720
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:21.960
She reminds me of you.

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:24.640
You gonna go help her?

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.800
I think you should help her.

1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:28.960
I wish I could...

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:32.680
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.560
You can do it.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:39.960
You can do anything.

1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:43.200
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:52.680
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:54.800
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.240
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:07.120
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:15.680
All right, what's our plan?

1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:19.040
To shrink that wall.

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:20.440
It looks load-bearing.

1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:21.760
The ceiling could collapse.

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:23.440
Then we run like hell.

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:25.760
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:27.760
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:29.240
They're all heavily armed.

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:30.520
Not great odds.

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:32.360
You got any better ideas?

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:33.520
Nope.

1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:36.280
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.400
She'd be so proud of you.

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:44.840
Okay.

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:47.120
One...

1:10:47.840 --> 1:10:48.800
two...

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:54.960
Scott?

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:56.760
ANT-MAN: What're you two
just standing around for?

1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:58.400
We gotta go find that lab.

1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:00.360
What about me?

1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:02.880
Perfect.

1:11:03.040 --> 1:11:04.800
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:19.600
THE WASP: Okay, now what?

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:21.320
You're asking me?

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.120
Get in!

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:31.440
Hi.

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:33.040
Hi.

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:38.840
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.760
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:42.840
until they start shooting
at us?

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:44.760
-Yeah.
-

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:50.840
-Hey, Burch.
-BURCH: Yeah.

1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:51.920
Yeah, they're out.

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:53.440
I'm on my way.

1:11:58.240 --> 1:11:59.640
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:01.000
How could this happen?

1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:02.880
I mean, what the dickens?

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:06.640
Thank you.

1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:08.640
You're welcome.

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:12.760
So, uh, how do we find
the lab?

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.160
After we lost it
the first time...

1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:17.120
I put on a new tracker...

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:18.960
of sorts.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.400
That'll work.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:57.920
Is it ready or not?

1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:00.960
BILL: We can begin
the extraction process.

1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:03.040
Listen, Ava.

1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:04.920
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:06.920
Maybe we should...

1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.640
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:11.920
I've got days until I'm dead.

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:15.600
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:21.760
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.120
We don't have much time before

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:24.320
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.320
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.400
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:30.320
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:31.680
So, we should do that.

1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:33.960
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:36.560
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.880
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.440
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:43.160
Let's call it 2-A.

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:44.680
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:46.400
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:47.760
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1:13:47.920 --> 1:13:48.920
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:49.800
Scott!

1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:50.840
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.720
I'm going to dive.

1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:56.640
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:59.920
together,
protecting the tunnel.

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:02.960
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:06.480
Let me get her.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.760
I think he's right.

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:19.080
"Whassup?"

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:23.800
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:25.880
"Whassup?"

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:28.720
I had him follow us.

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:31.760
I thought we could use
some help.

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:34.560
SCOTT: All right.
I'm in position.

1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:35.760
The ants are headed in.

1:14:35.920 --> 1:14:37.160
Copy that.

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:38.400
LUIS: Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:41.400
-Do you want Pez?
-No.

1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:43.640
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:46.240
By the way, I love that suit!

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:48.360
Thanks, man.

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.440
I wish I had a suit.

1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:55.760
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:59.600
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:15.400
What is it?

1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:18.240
Don't know.

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:23.240
It's them!

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:27.240
They can't be far.

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.000
All right, Hank. Hank?

1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:52.520
-

1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:54.840
Dad, what's your status?

1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:56.920
HANK: Foster's taken care of.

1:15:57.080 --> 1:15:58.640
Suiting up now.

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:04.800
I just wanted to save Ava.

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:07.600
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:08.800
She's afraid.

1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:12.720
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:14.480
I promise.

1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:17.160
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:20.880
Good luck, Hank.

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:23.000
Thanks, Bill.

1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.360
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:50.960
Any sign of her?

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:52.240
No, nothing yet.

1:16:58.320 --> 1:16:59.400
Ava!

GHOST:
Call off the ants, Scott.

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:05.640
Oh, boy!

1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:30.320
ANT-MAN:
Can I get a status report?

1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:32.000
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:36.600
Ready to dive.

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:45.360
-In case I don't make it...
-HOPE: Don't.

1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:47.120
Don't say that.

1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:49.520
I can't lose you, too.

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:50.960
I love you, Hope.

1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:54.800
ANT-MAN: Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:12.040
Now.

1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:23.160
ANT-MAN: Misdirection.

1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:24.840
One of the first things
they teach you

1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:27.280
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:30.240
GHOST: No!

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:35.120
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:37.240
Meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:38.720
ANT-MAN: Okay, on my way!

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:39.800
Oh, no.

1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:46.000
Really?
This guy again?

1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.280
ANT-MAN: Who?

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:49.440
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:52.720
Change of plans.

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.160
Hang on.

1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:08.560
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:19.160
Hold on.

1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:34.800
That undercarriage is filthy!

1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.400
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:42.840

Hope, what're you doing?

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.240
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

HOPE: Don't worry,

1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:46.640
I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.

1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:48.880

Wait, what're you... Oh.

1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:10.520
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

We're gonna die!

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:26.640
You gotta check the van!

1:26:30.200 --> 1:26:31.240
Huh?

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:36.200
Awesome!

1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:04.360
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:05.720
Burch's boys are all over me.

1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:06.960
THE WASP: I'm on my way.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.200
ANT-MAN:
Right. I'll get the lab.

1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:13.640
THE WASP: Hi.

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:16.320
Oh, that's badass!

1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:26.360
-Nice.
-

1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:36.480
ANT-MAN: Doink!

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:43.880
Come here, you little weasel!

1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:45.760
No, you don't!

1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:50.800
I guess maybe you do.

1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:53.080
-

1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:07.520
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:14.160
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:17.280
-Would you just one time,

1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:18.760
please work!

1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:22.360
All right, I need help.

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:24.600
-Yes!
-

1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:27.840
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:29.680
Somebody!

1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:31.360
Hey! Come on, man!

1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:33.880
Not cool!

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.240
Murderers!

1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.880
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:43.080
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:44.560
You're a badass!

1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:46.520
Yes!

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:50.040
No, no, no!

1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:51.800
Ant-onio!

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:55.760
Our friends, the humpbacks,

1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:57.720
dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...

1:28:57.880 --> 1:28:59.920
for a little leisure
and a little breeding.

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:01.280
Listen, Uzman...

1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:03.600
And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:05.440
Just meet me
at the waterfront.

1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:06.640
In three hours.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:07.960
Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...

1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:09.920
but it looks like
we got some company.

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:14.080
Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.400
There it is.
There's a breach.

1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:18.960
What the...?

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:26.800
ANT-MAN: Hi. Sorry. Hi.

1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:29.160
It's okay. It's okay!

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.920
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:34.160
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:35.800
No, no! No, no!

1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:36.920
ANT-MAN: You're embarrassing
yourself now.

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:40.000
-Come on. Let go.
-

1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:41.080
Thank you.

1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:43.480
-

1:29:43.560 --> 1:29:45.280
I'll take this now.

1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.480
It melts your mind.

1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:05.880
HOPE: A message in your head.

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:09.360
SCOTT: I had a dream.

1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:11.200
YOUNG HOPE: Daddy?
Where's Mommy?

1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:12.800
ADULT HOPE: It's where I hid
every time that we played.

1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.000
JANET: I love you, Hank.

1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:31.800
YOUNG HOPE: Daddy?

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:37.600
Daddy?

1:30:40.640 --> 1:30:43.440
Dad?
What's going on?

1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:44.760
Why haven't you found Mom?

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.680
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:54.080
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

1:31:49.960 --> 1:31:51.760
It's me.

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:07.200
I'm so sorry...

1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:10.720
it took so long.

1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:12.160
No.

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:17.200
You're here now.

1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:19.960
Let's go home.

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:23.680
HANK: I thought I was gone.

1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.440
But that energy
from your hands...

1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:29.000
how did you do that?

1:32:31.840 --> 1:32:34.800
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:36.440
This place...

1:32:37.400 --> 1:32:39.440
it changes you.

1:32:41.240 --> 1:32:44.440
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:45.800
evolution.

1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:50.360
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Lab coordinates not found.

1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:51.920
Do not ascend.

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.280
I should probably tell you

1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:56.280
what we're dealing with
up there.

1:32:58.120 --> 1:33:00.800
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:03.240
Move.
Move.

1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:05.880
-Move!
-

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.200
Get out of the way.

1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:14.960
Let's go.

1:33:16.680 --> 1:33:20.280
REPORTER: No one here appears
to be sure what this is.

1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:23.280
It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.

1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:30.200
-Get out of the way!
-

1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:34.240
I got the lab.

1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:37.320
The air feels chunky.

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:39.040
HOPE: Oh, no. He's too big.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:43.960
LUIS: Scotty!

1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:45.000
Scott!

1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:47.000
ANT-MAN:
I'm gonna go to sleep.

1:33:47.160 --> 1:33:50.040
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:51.720
I just need five minutes.

1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:54.200
Five minutes!

1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:02.600
You get the lab
somewhere safe.

1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:05.360
-Scott's air won't last.
-Okay.

1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:21.120
LUIS: Move!

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:24.080
-Move! Move!

1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:27.040
No, wait!

1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:40.120
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Lab at full scale.

1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:41.400
They did it.

1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:42.800
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Ready to ascend.

1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:44.600
Let's go see our daughter.

1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:08.080
THE WASP: Scott!

1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:10.960
Scott!

1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:13.160
Scott, come on, wake up!

1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:29.800
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:33.280
Gotcha.

1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.600
Scott?

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:45.880
Hey.

1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:46.880
Hey.

1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:51.800
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:53.800
Did you get crushed
by the building?

1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:58.440
Where's the remote, Luis?

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.720
It's probably in there.

1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:02.840
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:04.800
I guess
this is where we say...

1:36:05.480 --> 1:36:06.920
Adiós, amigo.

1:36:07.400 --> 1:36:09.000
-LUIS: No, no, no, no!
-

1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:13.160
Thanks, guys.

1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:20.920
BILL: Ava?

1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:23.040
Ava!

1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:27.400
Ava!

1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:28.920
Almost ready for extraction.

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.320
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.000
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:35.760
What if Hank is right?

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:37.600
What if this process
kills Janet?

1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:39.000
What, you're worried
about her?

1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:41.080
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:42.480
She may be able to help.

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:45.080
Oh, she will help. Right now!

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:47.080
And if she dies, she dies!

1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.960
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:52.160
We have to find another way.

1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:57.280
This is the way.

1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:19.680
Janet!

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:31.800
THE WASP: She started
the extraction.

1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:33.960
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:44.120
No!

1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:19.560
-ANT-MAN: Hope!
-

1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:37.720
Are you okay?

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.400
Mom?

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:03.960
Oh, my God.

1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:10.440
HOPE: We found you.

1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:16.040
I missed you so much.

1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.960
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:22.680
It's okay.

1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:25.840
I'm here now.
We have time.

1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:29.880
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:32.320
I promise.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:33.480
HANK: No, it's okay!

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:35.400
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:37.320
-I'll be fine.
-Dad.

1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:44.080
Scott.

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:45.920
Miss Van Dyne.

1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:49.080
It's nice to...

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.680
Well, I guess
we've already met.

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:53.240
Yeah. I guess we have.

1:39:56.440 --> 1:39:57.280
Wait.

1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:07.160
Your pain.

1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:10.400
I can feel it.

1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:14.240
It hurts.

1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.240
It always hurts.

1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:22.640
I'm sorry.

1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:27.840
I think I can help you.

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:04.120
Did you know
she could do that?

1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:08.960
It's okay.

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:12.800
Guys, the cops are coming!

1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.120
Whoa.

1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:19.040
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:21.320
-I gotta go.
-We gotta go!

1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:23.720
What about them?

1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:28.520
-Hands in the air!

1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:30.880
-No! We are going to our jobs.
-No.

1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:33.080
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.480
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:38.640
We traffic
in stolen technology.

1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:40.680
And we have killed many,
many people.

1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:42.320
Uh, he's in charge.

1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:43.480
That's true, I am.

1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:45.400
I've also committed

1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:47.680
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:50.080
Some of them would shock you.

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.360
It is truth serum.

1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:00.960
We gotta get outta here.

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:02.720
Fast.

1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:05.360
I have an idea.

1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:07.120
Giant figure, now spotted

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.520
at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.

1:42:08.680 --> 1:42:09.720
All units move in.

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:11.240
Go, go!

1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:15.760
WOO: There he is!

1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:22.440
It's over, Scotty!

1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:24.720
I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!

1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:27.400
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:28.880
There's nowhere to hide.

1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:33.840
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:38.000
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:45.720
Magic.

1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:48.880
Damn it!

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.800
Get to Lang's, now!

1:42:57.280 --> 1:42:59.160
Well done, honey.

1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:00.800
-Let's go!

1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:09.920
Leave me here.

1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.200
We can make it.

1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:12.440
You said it yourself.

1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:15.840
I've hurt people.

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:17.680
-But you haven't.

1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.400
Go. Please!

1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:20.880
We can make it, Ava.

1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:22.800
Bill...

1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:25.000
I'm not leaving you.

1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.600
-

1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.240
Oh, hey, guys.

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:12.560
Are my two years up already?

1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:21.200
What's it like out there?

1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:24.440
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:26.680
Are food trucks still a thing?

1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:28.640
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:32.000
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:33.280
Where?

1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.200
Huh?

1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:36.880
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:41.200
Like, in general...

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:43.200
The next time
you do something bad,

1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:44.720
-I'll be there to catch you...
-Oh.

1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:46.840
You'll be watching...

1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.400
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:51.800
Why would I do that?

1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:54.480
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:56.120
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:58.200
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1:44:58.400 --> 1:44:59.640
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:00.920
Of course,
that would be strange.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:02.880
-Take it easy, Jimmy.
-Okay.

1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:05.360
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:07.680
I mean, because I'm free...

1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:09.200
Yeah. Come on.

1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:19.520
You ready?

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:20.680
Yeah!

1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.360
-Hi.
-Hi. Hi.

1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:26.800
Oh!

1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:29.920
DAVE: Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:31.600
LUIS: X-Con Security.

1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:34.080
Mr. Karapetyan?

1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:35.920
Yeah, you saw that?

1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:40.880
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:42.560
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:44.400
-Yeah!
-

1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:47.440
That's how you close a deal!

1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:17.280
This is awesome.

1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:19.440
So, Cassie...

1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:21.160
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:23.440
I wanna help people...

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:24.720
like my dad.

1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:26.720
Really?

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:29.720
I wanted to be his partner.

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:31.480
But he said he wants you.

1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:33.680
Is that so?

1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:39.720
Daddy!

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:42.240
Whoa! Hold on.

1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.320
-Move, get outta here!

1:46:44.520 --> 1:46:46.240
-Scott, don't, don't, don't!
-

1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:48.720
-CASSIE: Ow.

1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:50.560
Oh, gross!

1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:52.960
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:57.080
-Go! Shoo! Shoo!
-

1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:06.320
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:09.480
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.000
Now, I got this.

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:14.720
JANET: Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:17.480
This is... smaller.

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:22.200
SCOTT: Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:24.200
Ah, I think it has flair.

1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:25.640
-

1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:27.600
All right. Control's online.

1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.120
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:35.120
It should automatically
start absorbing

1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.480
quantum healing particles.

1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:39.600
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:41.120
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:43.240
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:44.480
We won't be able to save you.

1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:48.880
Okay.

1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:51.360
Going subatomic in five...

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:53.640
four...

1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:55.120
three...

1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:56.640
two...

1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:57.720
one.

1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:03.960
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000
ANT-MAN: Mic check, one, two.
One, two.

1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:13.640
How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?

1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:14.960
Scott, we read you.

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:16.720
ANT-MAN: I just wanna
make sure.

1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:23.320
Okay.

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:26.240
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:27.360
HOPE: Great.

1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.160
Preparing for re-entry in...

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:31.920
five, four, three...

1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:36.800
ANT-MAN: Hello?

1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:39.880
Ha, ha. Very funny.

1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:41.400
Hank, quit screwing around.

1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:43.920
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:45.760
Hank?

1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:48.440
Hope?

1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:50.080
Janet.

1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:52.280
Guys.

1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:55.080
Guys.

1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:57.160
Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.

1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:58.440
Bring me up, let's go.

1:50:58.920 --> 1:50:59.560
Guys!
