WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.878
[monitors beeping]

00:07.424 --> 00:09.759
[sighs] How much longer
is this gonna take?

00:09.843 --> 00:12.804
I don't know. How long does it take a man
to become a god, Lana?

00:12.887 --> 00:14.472
I don't know. Ten minutes?

00:14.556 --> 00:17.642
I still don't understand why I have to be
this naked in front of Mother.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.602
I don't think you appreciate
what I've done here.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.522
Billions of wires
carrying trillions of data packets,

00:22.605 --> 00:26.985
perfectly and delicately calibrated
to dive into the wet, gross mind of a man.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.571
It all looks pretty mad scientist-y.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.906
Oh, you've even got one
of those big power switches.

00:31.990 --> 00:35.160
That is a precision device
that I've been saving for something weird.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.494
So, Krieger, how does this work?

00:36.578 --> 00:40.749
You gonna transfer his memory banks
into my neuro-brain stuff or whatever?

00:40.832 --> 00:44.461
-I call it the reverse Frankenstein.
-Okay, definitely mad scientist-y.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.338
And you're certain this will give us
the information we need

00:47.422 --> 00:49.007
to rebuild the device IIA stole?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.676
I'm certain it might,
if his brain doesn't explode.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.511
Wait, which "his"? Am I the "his"?

00:53.595 --> 00:55.805
More importantly,
are we in the splash zone?

00:55.889 --> 00:59.642
Shh, quiet! I need total silence
to initiate the sequence.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.569
Sorry I'm late. I was volunteering at
what I thought was a soup kitchen--

01:09.652 --> 01:12.238
-Goddamn it!
-Oh, right, sorry.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.573
Wait, what are we doing?

01:13.656 --> 01:16.910
This guy has some science thingy
in his head that we need for money,

01:16.993 --> 01:19.079
but he's in a coma
and we're almost out of money,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.705
so Archer's gonna go into his brain.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.750
We're broke? Is that why
the vending machine costs money now?

01:23.833 --> 01:27.378
-No, they just finally fixed it.
-We're technically not broke.

01:27.462 --> 01:31.174
Just operating on a leaner budget
now that Robert is tightening the spigots.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.801
Well, money doesn't come from spigots.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.928
So that might be part
of the problem right there.

01:35.011 --> 01:38.306
That, and how much did
you spend on this thingamabob?

01:38.389 --> 01:41.893
You gotta spend money diving into brains
to make money diving into brains.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.563
Speaking of thingamabob,
do I need to be hooked up down there?

01:45.647 --> 01:47.649
Great question. Ka-thunk!

01:47.732 --> 01:49.651
[laughing maniacally]

01:49.734 --> 01:52.237
It's working. It's working!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.406
Here we go, buddy.
See you on your insides.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.574
No, no, no, no, no!

01:58.952 --> 02:00.995
[groans] Whoa.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.997
Wait, what happened? Where did he go?

02:03.081 --> 02:07.544
If by he, you mean me, well, then, ta-da!

02:07.627 --> 02:10.839
Where am I?
I'm getting a sex dungeon vibe.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.716
-You're not far off.
-Metaphorically or geographically.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.926
Did it work? Am I in?

02:15.009 --> 02:18.179
Nope. But, side note,
I know how to cure comas now.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.390
Would have been useful
a couple of years ago.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.936
The soup kitchen was a sex club.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.683
[groans]

03:03.766 --> 03:06.853
[Lana] Can you remember anything about
who you are? Where you come from?

03:06.936 --> 03:09.939
Uh, I think, maybe, your mom's butt?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.484
-Ooh, a funny scientist.
-Come on. I have my moments.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.486
I'm a scientist? Nice.

03:15.570 --> 03:19.324
It's possible the massive electric shock
may have fried a few of his circuits.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.701
Look, science isn't an exact science.

03:21.784 --> 03:25.538
Okay, then let's start simple.
Do you remember your name?

03:25.622 --> 03:26.623
Uh, no.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.542
I bet my name's something cool,
though, like Colt.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.877
Yeah. Let's go with Colt.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.211
Damn. That is cool.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.381
And you're sure you don't want us
to call you Dr. Something or Other?

03:35.465 --> 03:39.302
Ugh. Lame. Trust me. Colt is fine.
Wait! I'm getting something.

03:39.385 --> 03:43.598
A small, blue house,
two children, and a wife.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.267
Ugh. Enough. Colt,
you're a very important scientist

03:46.351 --> 03:48.394
on a very important mission, okay?

03:48.478 --> 03:51.022
To redesign the device
you were transporting in Moldova.

03:51.105 --> 03:55.068
Can do. I'll just grab
this pen and paper, and voilÃ .

03:55.151 --> 03:57.654
-[Pam] Not bad.
-[Cheryl] But terrible riding form.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.113
Oh, I guess I can't do.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.324
But you know the device
we're talking about?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.409
-What does it do?
-Well, if memory serves--

04:03.493 --> 04:05.578
-And it mostly doesn't.
-It's an energy source.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.082
Properly used, it could eliminate
our dependence on fossil fuels altogether.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.875
What about improperly used?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.461
It could wipe out all life on the planet.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.464
-Science, you crazy bitch.
-[laughs] Yeah.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.217
Oh, God, that must be why IIA wants it.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.386
It's a classic "evil villain
destroys the world

04:21.469 --> 04:24.389
with some sort of weird doomsday device"
plot, obviously.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.557
Oh, hey, wait!
I'm remembering some other stuff.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.893
-One, metal rules.
-Preach, brother!

04:28.977 --> 04:31.688
And two, I left my notes
on a memory stick hidden in the device,

04:31.771 --> 04:33.064
along with a homing beacon.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.150
Did I have a talky-talk on me
when you picked me up?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.361
Okay, I might be able to track it.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.990
-Whoa! Who is this hot piece of ass?
-That would be you.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.784
Ah! Here we go.
The device is in Singapore.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.036
IIA's headquarters are in Singapore.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
[sighs] I'll get my checkbook.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.378
-[knocking on door]
-That's my room service!

04:55.461 --> 04:58.214
-We just got here.
-I preordered it from the plane phone.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.593
Damn. How do you say "bitchin'"
in Singaporean?

05:02.677 --> 05:05.555
Actually, the primary language here
is Mandarin.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.640
Did that feel good? Making me feel small?

05:07.724 --> 05:08.725
Yes, it did.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.728
-This place is incredible.
-This was almost our honeymoon.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.521
Maybe an anniversary?

05:13.604 --> 05:15.940
Oh, sure, yeah, maybe. Hey, where's Ray?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.401
Who knows? He's been asking
for a lot of time off lately.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.653
For some family emergency or something.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.322
As if four cats are family.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.115
I'm all for a successful mission,

05:24.198 --> 05:27.368
but first-class tickets,
and a penthouse with room service?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.662
We need to talk about how much
all this is costing.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.205
Later. Everyone, listen up.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.709
Lana, Cyril and I will surveil IIA
and develop an entrance strategy.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.045
This will ping the homing beacon, I think.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.214
-Ah, still a bit fuzzy on the science.
-That's great.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.968
Krieger, stay here with Colt and try
to jog his memory for more information.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.636
Hey, I'll race you to remember.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.805
-Hey, I am a funny scientist.
-Eh.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.851
-And, Mother--
-There has to be a bar around here.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.145
Uh, keep doing what you're doing.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.857
-And, Robert, you're on point here at HQ.
-So what are they doing here?

05:57.940 --> 05:59.734
Um, comic relief?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.569
Thank you so much.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.363
Ah! Are you tipping him $500?

06:04.447 --> 06:07.909
Relax. It's my money, and sometimes
I like to give service people a thrill.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.787
I'm sorry, Miss,
was my service unsatisfactory?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.165
Perhaps this is generous in your country,
but in Singapore, it's--

06:14.248 --> 06:15.833
How would you Americans say it?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.335
-Jack shit.
-What?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.921
Singapore is an extremely wealthy country.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.297
And there he goes again.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.299
Ha! Your money means less.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.177
Wait, am I poor here?

06:26.260 --> 06:29.305
Do you really have
to bring that up right now?

06:29.388 --> 06:31.516
What? All I said was, "Trouble in hell,"

06:31.599 --> 06:34.560
as a play on "trouble in paradise,"
because your husband sucks,

06:34.644 --> 06:37.480
and it seems like you're avoiding him,
which, now that I think about it,

06:37.563 --> 06:39.690
I should've said, "Success in hell?"

06:39.774 --> 06:41.818
-I don't want to talk about it.
-What happened?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.278
Did you tell him about
tongue-wrestling that dude in Japan?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.531
-Jesus, Archer!
-You cheated on Robert?

06:46.614 --> 06:47.615
No!

06:47.698 --> 06:51.035
Well, I almost, sort of,
kissed someone else.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.496
-Oh, my God.
-But that's all that happened!

06:53.579 --> 06:55.331
-Besides the cuddling?
-Not helpful.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.167
-[panting]
-Okay, how about now?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.962
No, I don't think the jogging's working.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.006
Hey, what if you put me back
in the coma and woke me up again?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.093
-A hard reset.
-That's just crazy enough to work.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.928
Or not work. Pretty 50-50.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.888
I think I remember liking those odds.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.099
-God, I love science!
-[Lana] <i>Well, I don't.</i>

07:13.182 --> 07:16.144
[Cyril] Damn it, Lana, if you're making
a cuckold of Robert, he deserves to know!

07:16.227 --> 07:19.021
That is not what's happening!
And who are you to judge?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.691
-You and I both cheated on each other!
-And it broke me!

07:21.774 --> 07:22.942
Not a real high bar.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.237
Cyril, I'm sorry for the past, okay?
But this is different.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.281
I am not the same person I was back then.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.284
Also, I never told you about
any of the times I cheated on you

07:31.367 --> 07:34.620
when we were together,
and trust me, you were way happier for it.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.873
Oh, you never had to tell me.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.124
-[glass shatters]
-[woman giggles]

07:38.207 --> 07:40.126
[Archer] Shh, follow me.
We're gonna go in the bedroom.

07:40.209 --> 07:44.672
Oh! So, anyway, this is what
a king-sized bed looks like.

07:44.755 --> 07:48.176
I'll see you out, Mrs. My Dentist.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.052
-She fell for it!
-[laughing]

07:50.136 --> 07:51.554
Let's just focus on the mission:

07:51.637 --> 07:55.391
infiltrating this weirdly
casual botanical garden.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.726
Wait, I think we did it.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.730
This is the top spy agency in the world.
You can't just waltz right in.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.899
Really? Because it seems to be working.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.111
Bingo. All--

08:07.195 --> 08:10.364
-Clear!
-What the hell are you doing?

08:10.448 --> 08:13.367
Uh, putting the ghost
back in the meat suit. Going again!

08:13.451 --> 08:17.580
[gasps] 1 Bukit Batok Street 25,
Singapore, 658882!

08:17.663 --> 08:19.373
That's my address. I lived here!

08:19.457 --> 08:23.711
Also, I talked to God.
She is real, and she is pissed.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.172
-Sounds like my kind of broad.
-Okay.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.758
Go to that address and see
if he remembers anything else.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.512
-We'll stay here and handle the comms.
-Okay, are you sure you know how?

08:32.595 --> 08:35.348
-Go!
-Don't worry. We've got this.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.642
Sterling? Sterling, it's me.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.561
Sorry, Malory, we have
a similar system at my company.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.605
-I think you're on mute.
-Turn it up!

08:42.688 --> 08:46.651
-Sterling? Sterling! Sterling!
-And to speak, you gotta hold down the--

08:46.734 --> 08:49.278
If you move that hand another inch,

08:49.362 --> 08:51.280
you won't have it anymore.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.161
Thanks for joining the IIA team.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.747
Have a seat and fill out this application.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.209
-Orientation will start shortly.
-Uh, okay.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.003
Well, well, well,
look who just waltzed right in.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.338
We didn't have a choice.

09:07.421 --> 09:11.634
Some IIA drone handed us cucumber waters
and told us not to miss the orientation.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.803
And he complimented my surveilling.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.681
Looks like this is
some sort of recruitment event.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.975
They must be poaching agents
all over the industry.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.103
Welcome. Hey, y'all, come on in.
Come on in, welcome.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.689
-Let's fill up from back to front.
-Wait, Ray?

09:24.772 --> 09:28.359
Archer! Uh, this isn't what it looks like.

09:28.442 --> 09:32.405
Unless it looks like I'm working for IIA,
because then, yeah.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.699
Although technically I'm temp to perm.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.787
<i>Welcome to the IIA family.</i>

09:39.870 --> 09:43.499
<i>You're about to start</i>
<i>the most exciting journey of your lives.</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:45.293
<i>To be honest, I'm jealous.</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:48.129
Ray, what in the Harold Cole?
You're working for IIA?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.297
It's not personal.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.133
I just need a backup plan
in case the agency goes down.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.678
So you've been commuting back and forth
to work part-time in Singapore?

09:55.761 --> 09:58.889
I just borrow Robert's plane.
I mean, that way it's free 99.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.184
<i>IIA may be the world's leading spy agency,</i>

10:02.268 --> 10:04.103
<i>but we only have one mission,</i>

10:04.186 --> 10:06.480
<i>to make the world a better place.</i>

10:06.564 --> 10:10.151
Ugh. Why do all billionaires
have this gross savior complex?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.361
-You're married to a billionaire.
-For now.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.405
-Shut it.
-What are y'all talking about?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.407
-Lana cheated on Robert.
-We just cuddled!

10:16.490 --> 10:18.909
Which is emotional cheating,
which is way worse.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.912
-Yeah, she's a monster.
-Oh, my God. I want to die.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.541
And I want deets!
God, I have missed the hot goss.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
-Home sweet home.
-[flies buzzing]

10:27.710 --> 10:29.587
I guess I'm not married with kids.

10:29.670 --> 10:33.299
Hmm. This is your place? "Ooh" and "aw."

10:33.382 --> 10:36.469
As in, I'm in awe of how ew it is.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.805
I guess if I lived in Singapore,
I'd have to live in a hellhole like this.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.474
Probably drowning in my own urine.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.184
Oops, rent notice.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.187
Damn, my rent is $12,000 per month?

10:46.270 --> 10:48.022
Um, wait. Is that a lot?

10:48.105 --> 10:49.482
-Yes!
-Yes!

10:49.565 --> 10:51.776
Whoa! Sweet guitars!

10:51.859 --> 10:53.569
Right? I hope they're mine.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.446
Does any of this spark anything?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.114
Hmm, not yet.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.783
[gasps] Oh, no!

10:58.866 --> 11:00.660
-No! No!
-What?

11:00.743 --> 11:04.372
My name's not Colt. It's Jeremy. Ugh.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.749
-Wait, what's on the back of that?
-Numbers.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.251
Yes! Location coordinates, to be exact.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.795
Let's roll out, bitches.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.464
Hold on. I feel like there
has to be something else.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.467
-I think this might be important.
-Okay, just bring it with you.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.302
And-- And I think this might be important.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.971
The model submarine
and this broken plastic fork

11:21.055 --> 11:23.057
-are definitely important.
-Okay.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.559
And this! The model submarine,
the broken plastic fork

11:25.643 --> 11:29.563
and this poster of an alien in a bikini
are all important.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.190
Sure, fine, now can we just--

11:31.273 --> 11:34.318
And this! This is for sure important.
Oh, God, no!

11:34.402 --> 11:36.654
-[Pam] Wait, what about this?
-No, that's nothing.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.864
But it was hidden in that statue.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.158
[scoffs] Okay, fine.
But you're carrying it.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.618
[Fabian] <i>That's the big question?</i>

11:42.701 --> 11:44.870
<i>Well, here at IIA,</i>

11:44.954 --> 11:47.289
<i>the answer is flipping the paradigm</i>

11:47.373 --> 11:51.961
<i>so we achieve our measurables</i>
<i>with maximum ROI cost-benefit.</i>

11:52.044 --> 11:54.130
Hey, I just got corporate buzzword bingo.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.590
Well, mock all you want,
but Fabian knows what he's doing.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.925
Oh, yeah? And what is that?

11:58.008 --> 12:01.053
Securing a monopoly over the spy industry
so he can corner the market

12:01.137 --> 12:03.681
and gain undue influence
over national and global politics?

12:03.764 --> 12:05.391
He also makes a mean quiche.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.643
It's all just so structured.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.104
-An org chart?
-Hey! Snap out of it.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.480
Right. Bad guys.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.150
Organized, sensible,
401(k)-providing bad guys.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.152
Listen, this orientation
is our chance, okay?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.862
We have to get further into the building

12:17.945 --> 12:19.530
-without drawing attention.
-Good luck.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.157
Security might be breezy out here,

12:21.240 --> 12:24.243
but nobody gets into zone two
without a lapel chip.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.537
It also controls
when we can use the bathroom,

12:26.620 --> 12:29.165
which seems, you know,
like a crime, almost.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.625
Hey! They make us pay for these!

12:35.171 --> 12:38.632
Good God, this guy is lame.
This is supposed to be our competition?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.759
Technically, no. He's crushing us.

12:40.843 --> 12:44.763
You're so lucky this ripped on a seam.
You could've asked me for help, you know.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.683
Could I? Or are you too busy
working for the competition?

12:47.766 --> 12:50.311
-Again, not our competition.
-He's got a point, Ray.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.812
Of course, I'm gonna help you!

12:51.896 --> 12:55.232
I mean, don't get me wrong, the money's
great here, but y'all are family.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.026
I'm gonna try pinging the homing beacon.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.861
[Ray]
That must be the underground warehouse.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.070
Great. Can you take us there?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.071
-Sure thing.
-[chimes]

13:01.155 --> 13:03.365
Oh, I just earned
my bathroom break for the day.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.117
-Who needs a pit stop?
-I could tinkle.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.578
No time. Just pee in your pants.
It's what we trained for.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.705
-[Malory] <i>Sterling, dear, it's me.</i>
-[radio crackling]

13:09.788 --> 13:13.834
[Robert] <i>What is your status regarding</i>
<i>Operation IIA Takedown? Over.</i>

13:13.918 --> 13:15.419
-Damn it!
-[radio squealing, crackling]

13:15.503 --> 13:18.506
-[Malory] <i>Sterling? Sterling!</i>
-Moms, right?

13:20.758 --> 13:21.759
[grunts]

13:23.761 --> 13:27.348
Aw, totally bungling a mission
for avoidable reasons?

13:27.431 --> 13:28.849
Ah, it takes me back.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.353
Well, that was easy.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.189
Hey, what's the form you fill out
for getting your ass kicked?

13:35.272 --> 13:37.900
Looks like 22-C, which entitles them

13:37.983 --> 13:41.445
to free rehabilitation
and up to four weeks sick leave.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.989
Shit! The memory stick
is on the move from the warehouse.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.074
Okay, let's split up.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.118
Lana and Cyril, you get to the warehouse
and rig the device to explode.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.163
Ray and I will find the memory stick
and we'll meet you there.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.335
-Oh, no, why'd it have to be Terry?
-Please, we can take him.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.172
He's just the only friend I've made here.
We eat lunch every day at the same table.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.174
[man] <i>Attention. All agents,</i>
<i>be on the lookout</i>

14:02.258 --> 14:03.676
<i>for suspicious elements.</i>

14:03.759 --> 14:06.428
-[Ray] Oh, buttercups.
-Any weaknesses I should know about?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.765
-He loves pudding?
-Probably won't come up, but okay.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.016
Ah! [grunts]

14:11.100 --> 14:12.601
This isn't personal!

14:12.685 --> 14:16.021
I genuinely value you
as a coworker and a friend!

14:16.105 --> 14:19.024
-Who are you?
-Oh, screw you, guy!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.200
-Guards. Be careful.
-Should we tiptoe?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.327
Like you're tiptoeing around Robert?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.914
-Cyril, I swear to God.
-What will you do if he finds out?

14:33.998 --> 14:37.793
Well, as long as no limp-dicked, four-eyed
nerds run their mouths, he won't!

14:37.877 --> 14:41.005
One, we both know my penis
is generally firm when it needs to be.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.425
And two, I've been hesitant to say this,
but you leave me no choice.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.344
Lana Kane, you are turning into Archer.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.973
And you are turning into a gigantic pain
in my otherwise perfect ass.

14:51.056 --> 14:54.101
There's our target.
Okay, I'll create a distraction--

14:54.184 --> 14:57.563
No, I've got this.
Watch the bureaucratic master at work.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.898
You there!

14:58.981 --> 15:01.817
You can't be on guard duty.
You forgot to fill out your T9-32!

15:01.901 --> 15:03.152
Got it right here, pal.

15:03.235 --> 15:07.406
Oh. But that truck isn't a company asset,
which means you also need a--

15:07.489 --> 15:09.909
A CM-5? Not my first rodeo.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.077
Hey, don't you need a VS-10 to be in here?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.913
Crap. That's good bureaucracy.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.001
-Okay, maybe not the best distraction.
-Ya think?

15:19.084 --> 15:22.421
Just like your emotional affair isn't
the best distraction from the fact that--

15:22.504 --> 15:25.925
Oh, my God! I'm not turning into Archer.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.468
Really? Let's look at the evidence.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.430
You hit on anything that moves,
you party all night and sleep all day,

15:31.513 --> 15:34.433
and you've been taking way too many
gummy women's multivitamins.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.644
Wait, that's an Archer thing?

15:38.062 --> 15:39.939
[beeping]

15:42.816 --> 15:45.110
[alarm blaring]

15:45.194 --> 15:47.738
Damn it, those explosives
were the only way to blow up the device.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.659
-So we'll rig a bomb or something.
-Improvising? Okay, "Archer."

15:51.742 --> 15:52.743
-What?
-Enough!

15:52.826 --> 15:54.995
Everybody enough! If I know IIA,

15:55.079 --> 15:57.623
Diamond Force is probably
coming for us right now!

15:57.706 --> 16:00.417
-Diamond Force?
-The elite kill squad.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.628
-They all wear matching diamond rings.
-Cool.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.880
Well, we can't leave
the device and risk IIA

16:04.964 --> 16:08.384
using it to blow up the world,
which meansâ¦

16:08.467 --> 16:09.510
Yeah?

16:09.593 --> 16:12.221
Oh, I had hoped you had something.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.266
This is the nicest parking lot
I've ever seen.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.478
What do you think this space goes for
right here between these lines?

16:19.561 --> 16:20.729
Like, five, six million?

16:20.813 --> 16:24.274
-Do you recognize anything yet, Colt?
-Hold up. I thought his name was Jeremy.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.859
I'm sticking with Colt, damn it!

16:25.943 --> 16:30.072
-[gasps] There, that's it.
-[Krieger] Oh, my God. It's gorgeous!

16:30.155 --> 16:31.824
[Colt] Just installed
a new engine last year.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.119
There's a kegerator in the back,
and she gets three miles per gallon.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.330
But on a good downhill,
I can jack that baby up to four.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.499
How do you remember
nothing about who you are,

16:40.582 --> 16:42.042
and everything about this van?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.502
I mean, I get it.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.137
-Change of plans.
-As usual.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.388
What the-- Ray?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.556
Pam! Guess what?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.225
We don't have time for this.
It's Diamond Force!

17:19.705 --> 17:21.206
What's the plan, Archer?

17:21.290 --> 17:24.668
Uh, swerve until they accidentally
shoot the device and blow it up for us?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.046
Someone get Mother on comms!

17:27.129 --> 17:29.465
I need some cataract-filled
eyes in the sky.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.760
We no longer have comms
because you two destroyed them!

17:32.843 --> 17:35.304
Shouting at me doesn't
make me regret things, Cyril.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.015
Yeah, sometimes you have
to make a call in the moment.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.850
Oh-ho! Of course you'd take his side.

17:39.933 --> 17:40.976
Whose side? Mine?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.353
I am not turning into Archer!

17:43.437 --> 17:46.607
Okay, I really feel like
you guys are talking about me.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.485
-Damn it, will you be quiet?
-Wow, passive aggressive much?

17:49.568 --> 17:50.944
Not the point, asshole.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.740
This is Ray to Old Mother Hen.
Do you copy?

17:54.823 --> 17:55.824
[Malory] <i>What did he say?</i>

17:55.908 --> 17:58.035
-[Archer] <i>Mother!</i>
-It's them! We're back online.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.495
<i>I need you to find me a cliff.</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:01.497
-You look.
-Yeah! Teamwork!

18:01.580 --> 18:03.082
Okay, looking for a cliff.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.336
Let's see, there's a gentle slope.
It's really beautiful country.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.838
Oh, my God, dying over here!

18:09.922 --> 18:11.715
There. The Marina Bay Sands.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.384
<i>There's the incomplete</i>
<i>freeway overpass nearby.</i>

18:14.468 --> 18:18.055
Yes! I can't believe I'm saying this,
but nice work, Robert.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.477
Okay. Everybody in the van.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.688
-Excuse me, his name is Jethro Krull.
-Whatever!

18:27.356 --> 18:29.274
Smooth in-line tracking,

18:29.358 --> 18:31.735
and accurate ceiling constellations?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.278
This van rocks!

18:33.362 --> 18:35.989
<i>Did someone say, "Rock?"</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.617
Ragnar Rockingson!

18:38.700 --> 18:40.702
Oh, good, another Krieger.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.038
[grunts]

18:44.915 --> 18:46.708
Get the memory stick and Colt out of here!

18:46.792 --> 18:47.709
[Lana] What about you?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.711
I'm gonna ditch the flatbed
over the overpass

18:49.795 --> 18:51.463
and hope the fall destroys the device.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.217
What if you can't make it out in time?
Just jump the gap and we'll lose them.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.718
This way's more heroic.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.054
Asshole! [grunts]

19:06.812 --> 19:07.980
[groans]

19:10.774 --> 19:13.610
[shouting]

19:15.654 --> 19:17.239
Archer!

19:18.824 --> 19:20.409
[helicopter whirring]

19:20.492 --> 19:21.493
Oh, shit.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.329
-Sterling Archer.
-Present.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.958
You may have destroyed
my device and stolen my plans,

19:28.041 --> 19:31.461
but you left us
with a very powerful bargaining chip.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.629
-My life?
-Your life!

19:32.713 --> 19:35.174
Shit, sorry. I can tell you
thought that would sound cool.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.177
Here, try it again.
Blah blah blah, bargaining chip and--

19:38.260 --> 19:39.261
Oh! Shit!

19:39.344 --> 19:41.180
Do you ever shut up?

19:41.263 --> 19:42.431
At movies, I guess.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.266
If they're good. Ow!

19:44.349 --> 19:47.978
Oh, God, Mr. Archer is gonna die,
and the agency is gonna go bankrupt,

19:48.061 --> 19:50.314
and I'll be stuck in Singapore
living in this van!

19:50.397 --> 19:53.442
-Back seat folds down into a bed.
-Oh, my God, it does!

19:53.525 --> 19:55.944
You know you're still
bonkers rich in America, right?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.280
-Oh, yeah. I feel better. Let's go home.
-[sirens wailing]

19:58.363 --> 20:00.574
Okay, what about
saving Archer and the agency?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.034
Eh, I've got options.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.036
Cyril, cover me. I'm going after him.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.538
And how do you plan to do that?
That's Diamond Force!

20:06.622 --> 20:09.666
-I mean, did you see those rings?
-I'll figure it out on the way!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.543
So no plan. Just like Archer.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.796
Risking everything
for whatever works for you.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.717
It's a shame it had to come
to this, Sterling Archer.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.637
Yeah, I'm feeling that too.
Might be a near-death thing though.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.014
Near death? I don't want to kill you.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.974
I want you to work for me.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.936
It's just a shame it involved
blowing up my warehouse.

20:29.019 --> 20:32.064
What? When we first met
you said you'd never hire me.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.941
What can I say? You've grown on me.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.360
Your pure, raw instincts are something

20:36.443 --> 20:39.071
no organizational flowchart can replace.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.406
Well, right now,
my pure, raw instincts are saying,

20:41.490 --> 20:42.699
"Screw you, Fabian!

20:42.783 --> 20:45.702
I'll never help you with your classic
'evil villain destroys the world

20:45.786 --> 20:47.996
with some sort of
weird doomsday device' plot."

20:49.873 --> 20:51.667
-What?
-You heard me. Never!

20:51.750 --> 20:55.128
Wait, do you think I'm, like,
some kind of supervillain?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.839
[laughing]

20:57.923 --> 21:00.759
Oh, my God, that's soâ¦

21:00.842 --> 21:02.302
Oh, that's so funny.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.305
Okay, I can totally see
how it could have come off that way.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.891
Wait, so you're not trying
to destroy the world?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.059
No!

21:09.142 --> 21:13.897
Archer, I want to use the device
for its intended purpose:

21:13.981 --> 21:18.110
eliminating our global dependency
on fossil fuels.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.196
Really? Wow.
I mean, talk about crossed wires.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.740
But first, I'm going to make
fossil fuel companies

21:23.824 --> 21:26.451
pay me a huge ransom
not to use the device,

21:26.535 --> 21:28.578
whilst also running a protection racket

21:28.662 --> 21:32.124
over every major country
to ensure I don't blow them up.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.544
Okay, wires uncrossed.
You're evil. I'm back out.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.213
Shame, I'm going to make trillions.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.132
And you could have been part of it.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.300
But alas.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.595
[laughs] Holy shit!

21:45.679 --> 21:46.722
Oh, my God.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.724
Oh, you guys are in so much trouble.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.143
Let me introduce you
to Barry the death cyborg,

21:51.226 --> 21:53.687
who actually is my friend now,
right, Barry?

21:53.770 --> 21:56.690
Sorry, pal. It's actually Other Barry.
