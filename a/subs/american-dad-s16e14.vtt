WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:07.757
Mom, I notice lately you're
putting tilapia in every dish.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.884
Even the ice cream has fish bones in it.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.511
I 'unno. I dig it.

00:12.721 --> 00:15.890
Welp, gotta go.
Got a date with the library.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.643
Gotta get my read on!

00:18.727 --> 00:20.603
We believe you, honey.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.313
Peace!

00:23.356 --> 00:26.526
There's no way Mom's reading
at the library every night.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.153
She won't even go to a restaurant

00:28.236 --> 00:29.779
if it doesn't have a picture menu.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.490
Of course she's not
actually at the library!

00:32.574 --> 00:34.409
She knows I could never smooch a bookworm,

00:34.492 --> 00:35.952
let alone do it with one.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.371
I got twenty says Mom's
actually been sneaking

00:38.455 --> 00:41.750
her pet orangutan into the zoo
after hours so it can get laid.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.918
Well, this, of course, hinges
on my other long-standing theory

00:44.002 --> 00:46.171
that Mom has a secret pet orangutan.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.758
Ben Frank says she's sneakin'
off to be a Patch Adams.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.261
Going to hospitals and goofing
off to get those uptight doctors

00:53.344 --> 00:55.221
to stop taking themselves so seriously.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.933
Guys, I need to get
something off my chest.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.771
I'm...struggling with depression.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.606
I'm in the darkest place I've ever been.

01:04.689 --> 01:08.234
Ooh, ooh! I have a fiver says
Francine is carrying buckets.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.111
Maybe down a road...

01:10.195 --> 01:13.531
or at a... bucket...factory.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.408
Super interesting.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.160
But didn't you have the CIA

01:17.243 --> 01:19.079
put a tracking device on Mom's car?

01:19.162 --> 01:20.789
That's so I can know where
your mom is at all times

01:20.872 --> 01:22.457
so I can control her.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.126
But I don't want to use it
for other, twisted reasons.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.295
But isn't this wanting to know

01:27.378 --> 01:29.005
where she is so you can control her?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.716
No, no, it's not. Oh, wait! Yeah, it is!

01:34.260 --> 01:38.223
The tracker confirms
Francine's at the...library!

01:45.396 --> 01:47.273
-Hi, Jolene.
-Hey, Francine!

01:47.357 --> 01:49.484
Oh, I put some new reading materials

01:49.567 --> 01:51.236
in the restroom for you.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.782
-Did you say something?
-I said...

01:55.865 --> 01:57.408
Thanks!

02:01.663 --> 02:03.957
Good morning, USA

02:04.040 --> 02:07.794
I got a feelin'
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

02:07.877 --> 02:11.005
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

02:11.089 --> 02:15.301
And he's shinin' a salute
To the American race

02:17.220 --> 02:20.473
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

02:20.557 --> 02:22.767
-Good--
-Good morning, USA

02:22.851 --> 02:24.102
Aah!

02:25.395 --> 02:28.773
Good morning, USA

02:31.359 --> 02:35.071
I can't believe this!
Francine's a bookworm!

02:35.155 --> 02:38.575
We're not a family of nerds!
We're a family of jocks!

02:38.658 --> 02:41.161
Except for...Steve.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.370
You did this!

02:42.453 --> 02:43.997
Look! He's got glasses, Stan!

02:44.080 --> 02:45.540
Knock 'em off! Knock 'em off!

02:45.623 --> 02:48.960
Mom's the one at the library! I like TV!

02:49.043 --> 02:50.712
That's what the glasses are for!

02:50.795 --> 02:53.548
Oh, Francine! This isn't
how it's supposed to be!

02:53.631 --> 02:55.425
We were going to grow old together!

02:55.508 --> 02:57.093
And then I would be the first to die,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.805
she would mourn me for 17 months
and start dating Jackson.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.308
That was the plan!
Did she forget the plan?

03:03.391 --> 03:06.019
We can't do the plan if she's a bookworm!

03:06.102 --> 03:09.147
I gotta go down to that library!

03:09.230 --> 03:11.524
Goodbye, cruel world.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.154
I just tried to drown myself.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.244
Smell like Totino pizza roll.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.288
This Steve turd.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.710
Rogu, we have a pool.

03:30.793 --> 03:34.589
Rogu collect doo-doo data.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.133
As a parent, I'm mad, but as a scientist,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.135
my instinct is to encourage this.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.639
Rogu missing one doody, though.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.099
Francine.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.560
Really? Francine's super regular.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.230
She always used to poop
right after dinner.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.483
Francine's not going to
the library to read words!

03:53.566 --> 03:55.401
She's going there to leave turds!

03:55.485 --> 03:56.694
But why?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.196
Who cares?

03:58.279 --> 04:01.783
I know someone who would care quite a bit.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.037
Sherlock Groans, poop detective!

04:06.120 --> 04:07.455
I gotta get to the library

04:07.538 --> 04:10.166
to solve the case
of the displaced doo-doo.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.336
Otherwise my nemesis Nancy Poo
might beat me to it

04:13.419 --> 04:15.463
or, worse, the Farty Boys.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.674
So you can see how serious this is, Rogu.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.800
Yes.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.262
Time is of the ass-scents.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.056
Ah. Good one! Daddy's proud.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.850
But not too much.
I'm kind of the star here.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.774
- Ah-ha!
- Aah!

04:35.858 --> 04:37.026
What are you doing?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.444
What are you doing?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.113
Sorry. I know what you're doing.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.991
But why? But also, hi!

04:43.074 --> 04:46.119
Please tell me my wife isn't really here!

04:46.202 --> 04:47.370
Hm, what does she look like?

04:47.453 --> 04:48.871
She's got the hair.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.124
Uh, couple little feet.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.792
-Does she have the boobs?
-Yes!

04:52.875 --> 04:55.295
Oh! Francine!

04:55.378 --> 04:56.379
She's in the bathroom.

04:56.462 --> 05:00.174
Thank God! Maybe I can
stop her before she reads.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.760
Mystery fans everywhere need to know.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.930
Why are you coming to
the library to do your business?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.224
-I don't want to talk about it!
-Come on!

05:08.308 --> 05:11.769
I got dressed up in my Sherlock
Groans outfit and everything!

05:11.853 --> 05:13.062
It's embarrassing.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.439
Uh, which part? The hat?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.524
Or, like, this little cape
on my shoulders?

05:16.607 --> 05:18.526
Francine!

05:18.609 --> 05:20.320
-Are you in there?
-Is that Stan?

05:20.403 --> 05:23.823
Yeah, he's on some jock mission
to not let you read like a nerd.

05:23.906 --> 05:28.161
Francine, we need to talk
about how you're...a reader.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.122
-Told ya.
-Stan can't know I come here to poop!

05:31.205 --> 05:33.583
Maybe... hide me in the toilet?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.752
Are you kidding? That's
the first place he'll look!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.795
Remember? That's the first place I looked.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.841
Damn it, Francine! I'm slowly building up
the courage to enter the women's room!

05:41.924 --> 05:43.259
You gotta hide me!

05:43.343 --> 05:47.263
I could use my alien powers
to place us in one of these stories.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.557
-You can do that?
-You know it!

05:49.640 --> 05:51.434
But I've never done it before,

05:51.517 --> 05:53.061
so it could be highly risky.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.897
It could also be smooth sailing.
Lots of variables here.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.774
I'm a poop detective,
not a book scientist.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.484
Roger, put me in the damn book!

05:59.567 --> 06:01.611
How 'bout we take a trip to the ballroom?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.863
That sounds fun.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.573
Francine?

06:07.116 --> 06:09.035
Francine!

06:09.118 --> 06:10.411
Francine!

06:10.495 --> 06:12.663
Did I say that out loud?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.416
Where the hell did she go?

06:23.216 --> 06:27.428
Oh, my God! It worked!
We escaped!

06:27.512 --> 06:30.014
Oh, this kind of ballroom.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.643
Someone stole this poor woman's clothes!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.561
I can see her ankles!

06:35.645 --> 06:37.188
Perhaps she's a prostitute.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.940
I'm not a prostitute!

06:39.023 --> 06:41.651
For the right amount of money,
anyone's a prostitute.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.861
That's, like, Being Alive 101.

06:43.945 --> 06:48.366
She's so exotic! She must be Italian!

06:48.449 --> 06:50.952
That's correctamundo.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.870
A-Lisa Lampanelli.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.248
Ooh! Please! Sing us a song!

06:55.331 --> 06:57.875
Italy has the most wonderful music.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.419
Follow my lead.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.672
When the moon

07:02.755 --> 07:04.382
-Hits your eye
-Hits your eye

07:04.465 --> 07:06.843
-Like a big pizza pie
-He's a big pizza guy... pie!

07:06.926 --> 07:09.470
-That's amore!
-Tuesdays with Morrie!

07:19.856 --> 07:23.151
So, I guess we just hang out
in Pride and Prejudice

07:23.234 --> 07:26.446
until Stan gives up and stops
searching the library for me?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.531
Yeah, about that,
since I helped you escape,

07:28.614 --> 07:31.075
you gotta tell me
why you poop at the library.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.245
It's because of what happened

07:34.328 --> 07:36.998
two years ago on our flight to Maui.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.918
I had the barbacoa tacos
from Taco King before takeoff,

07:41.002 --> 07:43.713
and it ripped through me at 10,000 feet.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.550
I was locked in the lavatory
for a solid hour.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.386
Fortunately, Stan was watching
Son of the Mask,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.054
so he didn't notice I was gone.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.933
Okay, so you had diarrhea on a plane.
I don't understand the embarrassment.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.768
My mom always told me

07:57.852 --> 08:00.271
to preserve some mystery in marriage.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.357
Your mom who shaves her
bikini line at the hotel pool?

08:03.441 --> 08:05.151
Just let me say...

08:05.234 --> 08:09.405
not all plane accidents involve a crash.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.576
After I dropped that stink bomb,
it was bad.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.746
It was "emergency land the plane

08:16.829 --> 08:19.624
because it stinks so bad" bad.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.417
-No!
-In Omaha.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.169
No!

08:23.252 --> 08:26.005
I've never seen Stan so upset.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.757
He swore he wouldn't rest

08:27.840 --> 08:30.343
until he found out who was responsible.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.054
I've been so afraid
that he'd find out it was me,

08:33.137 --> 08:35.681
I've just been avoiding
our bathroom altogether.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.352
I smashed my champagne flute for drama,
but I'm having regrets.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.603
Are you listening to me?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.563
I can listen and miss my champagne

08:42.647 --> 08:44.357
at the same time, Francine.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.693
Ahem! I'm not sure how people
do things in Italy,

08:47.777 --> 08:51.614
but here in England,
we don't discuss diarrhea.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.699
Don't say that word!

08:53.783 --> 08:56.244
They said it! I was just repeating it!

08:56.327 --> 08:57.787
This is an outrage!

08:57.870 --> 08:59.789
I was falling in love with Miss Bennett!

08:59.872 --> 09:03.251
Oh, Darcy! My heart overflows!

09:03.334 --> 09:05.169
But now that I've heard discussions,

09:05.253 --> 09:08.631
here in England, of Italian diarrhea,

09:08.714 --> 09:12.718
I've been tempted by the lures
of obscene foreign delights.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.345
Off to Italy!

09:14.428 --> 09:17.473
Wow. First, he thinks
I don't have enough money.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.059
And now I don't have enough diarrhea?

09:20.142 --> 09:22.395
What do men even want?

09:22.478 --> 09:25.356
These two ruined everything!

09:25.439 --> 09:27.483
Kill the Italians!

09:31.571 --> 09:34.323
Where'd they go?
Why aren't they following us?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.783
I took us into a new book,

09:35.866 --> 09:37.910
whatever was under Pride and Prejudice.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.205
The books have to be touching
for me to take us into them.

09:41.289 --> 09:44.208
Looks like we're in a Dr. Seuss.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.918
Is that a Lorax?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.503
I do beg your pardon,

09:47.587 --> 09:50.381
but you appear to be
trespassing in my study.

09:50.464 --> 09:53.718
Oh! Sherlock Holmes! Roger,
that's, like, your thing.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.345
Sherlock Groans, at your service.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.640
Sherlock Holmes, at your service.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.808
And me?

10:00.891 --> 10:03.644
Still good ol' Francine!

10:07.315 --> 10:09.817
Damn it! Francine's not a nerd.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.528
How could she like... Jane Austen?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.240
Maybe if it was
Jane Austen Powers, bay-bee,

10:16.324 --> 10:17.908
then I'd get the appeal.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.119
I wish I could get rid
of all these dumb things.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.246
I think I can help you.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.664
But you're a librarian.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.541
Aren't books, like, your thing?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.168
Oh, I like books.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.964
But I'm married to the flame.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.219
So, you've gotta tell me,
what's with the little cape?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.596
You're not a superhero.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.723
You're right! It's ridiculous!

10:40.806 --> 10:44.769
Why I wear it is the only
mystery I could never solve.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.480
Would you two shut up?
Roger, take us home!

10:47.563 --> 10:50.232
That'd be great, wouldn't it, Francine?
If we could just go back?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
Are you saying we can't go back?

10:52.151 --> 10:53.819
Maybe. I just don't know how.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.988
I told you. This is my first time.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.949
Holmes! Holmes! The library's on fire!

10:59.033 --> 11:01.285
Check it out. It's Dr. Watson.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.287
Two Sherlocks?

11:03.371 --> 11:05.748
How do I know which one to shoot?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.249
Why do you need to shoot either of us?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.334
Him! Him!

11:10.294 --> 11:12.672
Hey! I'm Sherlock Groans.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.052
Pride and Prejudice:
A Diarrhea Adventure?

11:18.135 --> 11:20.888
Roger! I think we changed the book!

11:20.971 --> 11:24.225
It sounds like we made it
absolutely hilarious, frankly.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.894
But stop wasting time! There's a fire!

11:26.977 --> 11:29.730
Is this Alice in Wonderland?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.775
Ooh! I've always wondered
what he's smoking.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.531
It's actually
pretty weak shit.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.289
Whoa! Maybe this is stronger
than I thought.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.708
No, that really happened.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.292
Come on!

11:53.212 --> 11:55.548
The Yellow Brick Road?

11:55.631 --> 11:57.049
We must be in The Wizard of Oz.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.386
Oh, no! Oh, no, oh, no!

12:04.390 --> 12:07.184
Weird. There's a fire in all these books.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.729
Oh, no. I know what's happening.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.857
The librarian is a recovering pyromaniac!

12:12.940 --> 12:16.902
She just got her 20-year chip
and congratulatory lighter!

12:16.986 --> 12:19.029
And now she's gonna burn us to death!

12:19.113 --> 12:20.614
Roger, let's go!

12:20.698 --> 12:22.575
Of course, in the book, the magic slippers

12:22.658 --> 12:24.869
are silver, not ruby.
That was just in the movie.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.289
In fact, Judy Garland has said
it was the ruby slippers alone

12:28.372 --> 12:30.416
that launched her career as Judge Judy!

12:30.499 --> 12:33.878
We don't have time for--
Ooh! Those look good on you!

12:33.961 --> 12:35.254
Work it, girl!

12:35.337 --> 12:38.507
Oh, yeah! Now run, girl!

12:42.678 --> 12:45.723
Stan Smith! I knew I recognized you.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.601
You had that book signing here
a couple months ago.

12:50.144 --> 12:54.607
Book signings happen
at book stores. Dumbass.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.485
Hmm. Was my failure as an author

12:57.568 --> 12:59.445
why I turned against reading?

12:59.528 --> 13:00.946
Guess I'll never know.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.407
Because I'm destroying all the evidence!

13:10.623 --> 13:12.750
Oh, thank God! We're home!

13:12.833 --> 13:15.294
It must be because of the magic slippers!

13:18.964 --> 13:21.717
Why does Stan look like
a tall, skinny baby?

13:21.801 --> 13:25.387
Uh-oh. That's how he describes
himself in his memoir.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.390
His memoir?
What do you mean, his "memoir"?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.059
I mean, we're still in a book!

13:30.142 --> 13:32.061
You didn't read your husband's book?

13:32.144 --> 13:34.688
It was self-published. Yuck.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.192
I trust the coastal elites
to tell me what to read.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.401
Hey, look! It's you!

13:52.039 --> 13:54.375
And Stan gave you
itty bitty apple fritties.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.919
Does he think I have small boobs?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.088
Or does he want me to have small boobs?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.048
See, those are the kinds of questions

14:01.131 --> 14:04.009
great literature provokes. Now run!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.225
We're trapped!

14:11.308 --> 14:14.687
If we die in Stan's memoir,
do we die in real life?

14:14.770 --> 14:17.147
Well, I think I'll be fine.
I don't know about you.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.316
-What do you mean?
-Because of this!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.527
I don't burn!

14:21.610 --> 14:23.445
Being an alien's a hoot!

14:23.529 --> 14:26.073
Why have you been running
from the fire this whole time

14:26.156 --> 14:27.575
if you're gonna survive?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.743
I was trying to get my 10,000 steps in.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.662
Plus, if my heart rate gets over 90,

14:31.745 --> 14:33.122
I get an extra dessert.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.416
I'm thinking bananas Foster?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.298
These are good.
I see why people like these.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.509
And there's no cleanup!

14:45.593 --> 14:47.720
Seriously? Nothing, Francine?

14:47.803 --> 14:50.055
I'm working my ass off here
so you can meet the devil

14:50.139 --> 14:51.557
with a smile on your face.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.353
How the hell did that happen?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.398
I can't destroy my own work!

14:59.481 --> 15:02.610
I put four hours of my life
into writing it.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.820
We gotta figure out how
to get out of these books!

15:04.904 --> 15:07.948
Yes! So I can find out why Stan gave me

15:08.032 --> 15:10.534
those eensy weensy baby boobies!

15:13.913 --> 15:16.248
Jesus! What is that smell?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.460
Oh, no! No!

15:19.543 --> 15:22.046
This is the flight when
I took that poisonous dump!

15:22.129 --> 15:24.173
Ugh!

15:24.256 --> 15:27.051
Did someone burn the hair
off a dead squirrel?

15:27.134 --> 15:29.845
I don't smell anything.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.390
Hey! This awful smell
is ruining the Kind bar

15:33.474 --> 15:35.851
I bought at the airport for $17!

15:35.935 --> 15:39.480
Ugh! The stench is drifting
into first class!

15:39.563 --> 15:41.231
Over my dead body!

15:41.315 --> 15:44.944
All coach passengers,
link arms to protect the rich!

15:47.863 --> 15:49.907
On behalf of
the flight crew, I apologize

15:49.990 --> 15:51.825
for the smell coming from our lavatory.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.787
We're gonna have to make
an emergency landing in Omaha.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.206
I know it smells only
slightly better in Omaha,

15:57.289 --> 15:59.875
but they're the only airport
who will accept us.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.543
Omaha!

16:03.629 --> 16:05.130
This is unbelievable!

16:05.214 --> 16:07.216
I'm not going to rest until I find out

16:07.299 --> 16:09.927
whose dump destroyed
this plane's bathroom!

16:10.010 --> 16:13.389
And if I do somehow rest,
it will be the fitful sleep

16:13.472 --> 16:15.975
of a man who doesn't know
who took said dump.

16:17.601 --> 16:21.522
This is so embarrassing!
How could Stan publish this?

16:21.605 --> 16:23.774
I wanna go back to the real world!

16:23.857 --> 16:27.778
Maybe we would go back
if Stan couldn't publish this.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.154
What do you mean?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.907
I mean, if his memoir didn't
exist, we couldn't be in it.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.702
Right. What keeps a book
from getting published?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.495
Well, they wouldn't publish my book

16:36.578 --> 16:39.039
because it had an unacceptable
amount of bestiality.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.874
Only 14 scenes!

16:40.958 --> 16:44.670
Great! Let's throw a little
bestiality up in this memoir!

16:44.753 --> 16:47.798
That blind guy's German Shepherd
is probably DTF,

16:47.881 --> 16:49.591
so get to it!

16:51.552 --> 16:52.928
The dog turned me down.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.180
Because it thinks it's better than me!

16:55.264 --> 16:58.559
Okay. What else could keep this
memoir from being published?

16:58.642 --> 17:02.146
Well, you can't self-publish
on Amazon if it has bestiality,

17:02.229 --> 17:03.939
pedophilia, bomb making...

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
Bomb making? Let's do that one!

17:06.108 --> 17:08.402
One hitch, I don't know
how to make a bomb.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.238
I know it's kind of bougie,
but I always buy them pre-made.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.699
Girl, I could make
a pipe bomb in my sleep.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.367
But you don't have any of the ingredients.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.828
Yeah, but we can rewrite this memoir

17:17.911 --> 17:19.705
like we did Pride and Prejudice.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.670
A gallon of rubber cement,
a half cup of salt,

17:26.754 --> 17:30.007
10 pounds of manure, a steel pipe,

17:30.090 --> 17:32.384
and a Barbie leg for a fuse.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.304
-Voilà! Pipe bomb.
-You did it!

17:35.387 --> 17:36.597
Aah!

17:37.473 --> 17:39.349
Hey! There's my rake!

17:39.433 --> 17:41.518
It's actually not.
I brought this from home.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.811
What a weird lie.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.146
I'm a weird guy.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.065
Aah!

17:46.148 --> 17:48.233
Aw, come on! I just raked that!

17:48.317 --> 17:50.360
Did I actually make it back?

17:50.444 --> 17:52.529
Just in time to ruin my pile.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.364
My precious pile.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.201
Stan. I have to be honest.

17:57.284 --> 18:00.579
I don't come to the library to read.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.122
I come here to poop.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.459
In the books? Nice! So you are a jock!

18:05.542 --> 18:08.003
No, Stan. In the bathroom.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.713
To hide my real secret.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.715
Aah! Sorry I'm late.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.301
I jumped into the book 1984 to go back

18:14.384 --> 18:17.471
and get the Daytona Beach
spring break I always wanted.

18:17.554 --> 18:21.391
Suffice it to say,
it was not totally tubular.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.354
I don't get it, Francine.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.440
Your secret is you eat tacos
in the bathroom stall?

18:28.524 --> 18:29.775
That's not so bad.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.819
I once went back to get
the half cup of beer

18:31.902 --> 18:33.487
I left on the toilet at Shea Stadium.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.280
Although it was completely untouched

18:35.364 --> 18:38.075
and even more full than before,
it's still a little gross.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.911
I don't always
eat tacos in the bathroom,

18:40.994 --> 18:44.456
but I do always end up
in the bathroom afterwards.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.169
-What?
-Sir, in your story,

18:49.253 --> 18:50.963
I think you were drinking pee-pee!

18:51.046 --> 18:54.133
No, little girl.
It was just delicious hot beer!

18:54.216 --> 18:56.760
Are you getting
a whiff of anything yet?

18:56.844 --> 18:57.845
Like what?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.435
Oh, God!

19:05.519 --> 19:07.062
Omaha was you!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.273
I know.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.316
How could you hide this from me?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.110
I was raised to think a woman

19:13.193 --> 19:15.279
should keep some mystery in her marriage.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.905
But I don't want that.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.074
I want to know everything
about you, Francine.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.119
You do? Even the gross stuff?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.037
Yes, especially the gross stuff.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.498
But you seemed so upset on the plane.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.542
Yeah, I was mad I didn't
get to shake hands

19:28.625 --> 19:30.127
with the butt that made that mess!

19:30.210 --> 19:32.546
It was hilarious! Everyone
on the plane was like...

19:32.629 --> 19:35.424
Ugh-ugh-eghh-egh-egh!

19:35.507 --> 19:39.678
Wow! That is a weight off my shoulders.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.096
You know what?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.140
I'm gonna poop at home from now on,

19:43.223 --> 19:45.434
no matter how smelly it is.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.312
I would love nothing more, Francine.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.814
Although I don't think you can
ever top your airplane poop.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.774
Nothing will ever be funnier than that.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.277
Is that why you put it in your memoir?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.695
You read my memoir?

19:56.778 --> 19:59.656
Yeah! It really... sucked me in.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.116
That's so sweet of you.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.660
Man, that thing was terrible.
No one would even publish it.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.456
Well, those coastal elites are
out of touch with what's good.

20:07.539 --> 20:11.126
But, hey, why'd you write
about me having a flat chest?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.794
What was that all about?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.214
Flat chest? Oh, that must be a typo.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.924
I meant to write "fat chest."

20:17.007 --> 20:19.092
I love them fat sacks, baby!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.552
Oh, Stan.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.138
You always know just what to say.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.811
I was a little surprised to find a website

20:29.895 --> 20:32.064
that matched depressed singles
with each other.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.066
But look at you!

20:34.149 --> 20:36.026
Score for Klaus!

20:36.109 --> 20:39.279
You didn't say in your e-Sadness
profile that you're a fish.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.365
Oh, I see the miscommunication here.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.824
I was lying.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.078
Yeah, I don't date liars.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.998
Oh, and, by the way, I'm super into sex.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.376
Well, you didn't explicitly
say in your profile

20:52.459 --> 20:54.044
that you weren't a fish!

20:54.127 --> 20:56.380
And you don't see me crying about it!

20:59.007 --> 21:02.177
I miss sex!

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
Bye-bye! See you soon!
