00:03.503 --> 00:06.130
<i>Memphis Stormfront in the
Channel 3 News copter</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:10.510
<i>with something still exclusive
to live TV. A police chase!</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.304
<i>And if you're watching this
on YouTube years later,</i>

00:13.305 --> 00:15.432
<i>smash that like button, bruh!</i>

00:15.724 --> 00:17.433
Dad, that looks like your SUV!

00:17.434 --> 00:19.268
It can't be.
Mine's in the shop.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.314
It's making a weird sound,
kind of like...

00:24.608 --> 00:27.527
<i>A lot of smoke, and that...
can't be good.</i>

00:27.653 --> 00:29.028
<i>- Oh, he's getting out.</i>

00:29.029 --> 00:30.322
<i>He's making a run for it!</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:32.740
That's Wendell!
My mechanic!

00:32.741 --> 00:34.617
<i>The police are closing in.</i>

00:34.618 --> 00:37.036
<i>Wait, he's carjacking that Bugatti!</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:40.332
<i>- He is gone, gone, gone.</i>

00:40.749 --> 00:43.376
Two things. We might need
to look for a new mechanic,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.336
and I definitely need to get a Bugatti.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.797
But, honey, you love your SUV.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.465
Well, everyone's getting Bugattis.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.008
Even my friend Wendell has one!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.426
A sports car!

00:52.427 --> 00:56.348
Wow, what would the kids at school say
if we had a Bugatti?

01:01.561 --> 01:05.649
Hey, ladies. Need a ride?
There's room on my mom's lap.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.655
Hell yeah.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.329
Hey, boys. Need a ride?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.001
Hell yeah.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.632
Hell yeah.

01:33.552 --> 01:36.179
That settles it.
The Smiths are getting a Bugatti!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.556
Francine, Hayley, we're running behind,

01:38.557 --> 01:40.600
so hurry up and get
your fantasies in before the--

02:07.377 --> 02:10.672
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

02:13.342 --> 02:15.468
I've been kicked out of
car dealerships before,

02:15.469 --> 02:16.886
but never for financial reasons.

02:16.887 --> 02:20.640
Bugattis are like a million dollars.
We're fine with the SUV.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.933
We can barely even
afford to fix that.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.935
Where is all our money going
these days?

02:24.936 --> 02:27.813
Okay, I was gonna be
Baby Plumber Junior today,

02:27.814 --> 02:31.485
but after hearing your money woes,
I think it's a day for...

02:32.819 --> 02:35.571
Suzy Orwoman, financial advisoress!

02:35.572 --> 02:37.907
Want to know why
you can't afford that Bugatti?

02:37.908 --> 02:39.867
You're not making
your assets work for you!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.911
Intriguing. Go on, Mrs. Orwoman.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.747
That's Miss Orwoman.
Still haven't found the right lady

02:44.748 --> 02:46.248
to make an honest woman out of me.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.834
I'm a lesbian, so stop flirting with me.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.295
Okay, let's take inventory of your assets.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.839
Well, I've got this fridge
and the garage fridge.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.133
No, no, no, not material stuff.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.135
I'm talking these assets.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.097
What are these little
flesh and bone piggy banks doing for you?

03:01.098 --> 03:02.807
Steve. Contributions. Go!

03:02.808 --> 03:06.644
Easy! You know those couple hundred
sketches of Toshi I did last summer?

03:06.645 --> 03:07.728
Yes!

03:07.729 --> 03:10.648
Well, they're on sale on my Etsee page,

03:10.649 --> 03:13.777
and let's just say there's a lot of buzz.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.653
Speaking of buzzed... Hayley?

03:15.654 --> 03:18.155
I keep our food budget down
with restaurant leftovers,

03:18.156 --> 03:21.617
like the Hub's all-you-can-eat-but-you-
should-have-eaten-it-yesterday tuna salad.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.412
If we're talking budgets,
that's my department.

03:24.413 --> 03:29.125
I keep our books like I keep my man.
Sexually satisfied.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.087
Okay, okay, assets lookin' good so far.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.548
But what about Fleshbeard?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.259
- Me?
- Mooch alert!

03:37.509 --> 03:38.843
Jeff is not a mooch.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.471
- Well, he doesn't bring anything in...
- And he takes a lot out.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.722
Hey, that's right.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.766
He even mooched off my Bugatti fantasy.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.854
Lay off! What Jeff lacks in income,
he makes up for in heart.

03:49.855 --> 03:53.232
Please. Financially,
there's no monetary value to heart.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.443
Hit it, Klaus!

03:58.155 --> 04:02.324

04:32.981 --> 04:35.442
This trombone
tastes like shit.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.110
Ah, this is the heavily-used plunger

04:38.111 --> 04:39.737
from my plumber costume.

04:39.738 --> 04:40.821
Face it, Smiths.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.699
When it comes to your finances,
Jeff's worthless.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.453
Jeff, why are you dancing around
to a song about you being a mooch?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.247
That song was about me?

04:54.836 --> 04:59.340
Babe? You ever get the feeling
the family thinks I'm a mooch?

04:59.341 --> 05:01.342
Well, yeah.
Klaus sang a whole song--

05:01.343 --> 05:03.135
Never mind. Don't listen to them.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.220
Yoink!

05:04.221 --> 05:07.056
Your nightlight is costing us
ten cents a month.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.017
Ten cents I'll never see again.
Thanks to you, Jeff.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.061
But I'm scared of the boogeyman!

05:12.062 --> 05:14.313
Here. There's one starter bullet in there.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.067
You can earn the rest
by really making that one count.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.861
I think I need to get a job.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.365
Well, whatever it is,
just don't go overboard with it.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.659
Start with something simple.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.910
Okay.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.747
Big ball on a chain.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.791
Nothing simpler than that.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.464
Oh, shoot. I missed.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.883
Well, at least no one got hurt--

05:45.595 --> 05:47.137
A construction accident?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.889
He doesn't have health insurance yet.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.976
Here, Doc. Take my wallet to the ER,
it's hemorrhaging.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.230
Thanks, but seriously,
how much was his ambulance ride?

05:56.231 --> 05:58.483
You don't have to worry
about that.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.193
He came by wrecking ball.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.362
This isn't funny. He's my husband!

06:03.363 --> 06:06.407
Sorry, I think that pipe is laughing gas.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.286
So that's going to make
the bad news I have very awkward.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.621
Jeff's... [laughing] brain dead!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.747
Brain dead?

06:13.748 --> 06:16.625
And on... [sputters] life support.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.961
Life support?

06:18.670 --> 06:23.007
I have to see him
one last time!

06:29.055 --> 06:30.514
Hey, babe!

06:30.515 --> 06:31.682
Oh, my God! Jeff!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.017
We can't afford this room.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.852
Look at that,
the meter is already running.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.936
That's a heart monitor.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.439
- Turn it off!
- Almost no brain activity,

06:38.440 --> 06:39.815
yet he's still functional.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.694
Oh, this is totally normal for him.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.862
Did someone say,

06:44.863 --> 06:46.739
- "I promise not to sue"?
- Who are you?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.742
I'm a settlement lawyer
on behalf of Termite Demolitions.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.286
- Are you the victim?
- No, I'm the Jeff.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.370
Whoa!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.914
Clearly, some major brain damage here.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.043
That's going to take some extra zeros.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.963
Let's call this a healthy
shut-the-hell-up settlement.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.175
Keep Termite's name out of your mouth.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.760
Holy...

07:07.761 --> 07:09.511
Hey, you're rich!

07:09.512 --> 07:10.847
Nope, still Jeff!

07:18.063 --> 07:19.647
- Jeffy boy!
- Boogeyman!

07:19.648 --> 07:21.106
Nope, just Boogeystan.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.859
And don't you worry about your nightlight.
I'll get that for you.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.695
It just needs to be unsmashed
with my unhammer.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.656
Anything else you need?
More pillows?

07:28.657 --> 07:32.201
We want our El Jeff-ay nice and comfy.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.702
We've been calling you El Jeff-ay.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.332
I picked you up a box of condoms,
El Jeff-ay. Just in case.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.041
I poked holes in all of them.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.335
The next step is to get him
to impregnate one of us.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.087
Then we've got him locked down.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.214
I'm not picky about who.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.423
Let me rap at you, El Jeff-ay.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.635
Now that you're a millionaire
many, many, many times over,

07:49.636 --> 07:52.471
we thought you could help us
get some important things we need.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.555
Like a Bugatti.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.142
Yes, Jeff.
Stan's car is still in the shop so...

07:57.143 --> 07:58.227
I'm gonna need one too.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.813
And as you know,
Toshi and I have been working

08:00.814 --> 08:03.357
on our Siegfried and Roy
tribute show.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.901
I feel a white tiger
is a necessary next step.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.528
Get outta here, you vultures!

08:07.529 --> 08:08.613
It's Hayley. Split!

08:10.740 --> 08:13.367
Jeff, do not start buying them stuff.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.577
They're trying to mooch off you now.

08:15.578 --> 08:19.498
Look, we need to make smart investments
with this money and plan for our future.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.999
What are you saying?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.252
That we can get away from all this.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.378
The vultures.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.963
My childhood bedroom...

08:25.964 --> 08:27.047
The boogeyman?

08:27.048 --> 08:30.217
Yes! You get it!
And we'll get our own place.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.804
Wow. I never really thought
about that before.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.681
But actually, the boogeyman is an entity

08:35.682 --> 08:37.808
that transcends physical space,

08:37.809 --> 08:39.602
so there's really no escaping him.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.859
Lobster, El Jeff-ay?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.944
Francine's already cracked
the claws on this one.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.321
And how soon are we getting
all the stuff we asked for?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.407
It's Hayley! Split!

08:53.658 --> 08:54.825
Jeff, where were you?

08:54.826 --> 08:56.994
I was waiting at
the open house for an hour.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.539
I'm sorry, babe.
But I wanna tell everyone our new plan

09:00.540 --> 09:03.585
and let them know
why I won't be buying them Goobotties.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.918
Open house?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.336
- New plan?
- Goobotties.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.464
Klaus!

09:07.881 --> 09:10.257
Babe, you're gonna be so proud of me.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.259
I ingested the money wisely!

09:12.260 --> 09:14.720
You know the movie <i>We Bought a Zoo?</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:17.556
Please tell me you did not buy a zoo.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.767
I didn't!

09:19.184 --> 09:21.060
I got the exclusive Redbox

09:21.061 --> 09:23.771
streaming rights to the movie
<i>We Bought a Zoo.</i>

09:23.772 --> 09:24.855
Ah, [bleep].

09:24.856 --> 09:26.858
There's more! Check this out.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.278
It's new underwear
that hides your fart sounds.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.528
Listen.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.449
Ugh. What's that smell?

09:35.450 --> 09:38.994
Yeah, they smell way worse now.
But we're working on it.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.580
I bought the company for a cool million.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.664
What?

09:42.665 --> 09:43.916
Well, I've heard enough.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.459
And smelled enough.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.295
I think it's time
to let you in on one of Suzy Orwoman's

09:48.296 --> 09:50.005
once-in-a-lifetime deals.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.257
These only come along every couple months.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.303
Feast your eyes on Mount Suzymore!
Our casino, Jeff!

09:56.304 --> 09:58.972
You see, it's been my dream
to teach my methods

09:58.973 --> 10:01.058
through the responsible
tradition of gambling.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.769
With your money,
we can make my dream come true.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.895
No, no, no, no, no!

10:04.896 --> 10:06.438
It is not happening.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.359
Jeff, I am getting you
away from these parasites.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.196
That was me. I invested
in a competing underwear.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.700
It's not fair.
All these years of Jeff taking from us,

10:18.701 --> 10:20.702
and now he can finally give back
and he won't.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.539
Well, he did get us Shakira.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.041
She sucks!
She has one paw in the grave.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.920
At this rate,
Jeff's gonna lose all that money in days.

10:29.921 --> 10:33.424
Days...

10:33.883 --> 10:35.467
Oh, I forgot to mention,

10:35.468 --> 10:38.846
Jeff also got us this robot
that looks just like me.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.014
I'll put her away, for now.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.812
Hi, Steve. Did a gross old biddy
make her way over here?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.148
If she does, that's my mother,
so please send her home.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.316
I didn't know your mother
was living with you.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.069
I just moved her in.
The court named me as her conservator,

10:54.070 --> 10:56.530
so I'm managing
all her affairs and finances now.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.781
Oh!

10:57.782 --> 11:00.451
Someone found her!
I'm so "relieved."

11:02.120 --> 11:04.288
Huh. A conservatorship.

11:04.289 --> 11:08.792
That's not... I mean, that's not something
we could do with Jeff, is it?

11:08.793 --> 11:11.336
No, no, we can't do that.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.172
But could we?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.341
Well, it's an interesting word, isn't it?

11:16.342 --> 11:19.303
"Conserve." Like saving.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.222
Yeah, saving Jeff!

11:22.223 --> 11:25.559
- Saving Jeff from Jeff!
- And who better to save him

11:25.560 --> 11:28.312
than the people who know him
and how much money he has best!

11:28.313 --> 11:29.646
I don't believe this!

11:29.647 --> 11:33.066
You're actually talking
about taking away Jeff's independence?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.943
We can't leave Jeff
in charge of the money.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.195
He's gonna piss it all away.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.989
And let's face it,
he's never had good bladder control.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.116
I am not gonna let you do this.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.329
Well, I guess we'll have to
settle this in court then.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.165
The basketball court?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.710
Dang.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.546
Listen, Jeff, I'll do all the talking.
You just sit there.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.964
Here, work on this.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.424
Court is now in session.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.635
Honorable Judge Grenier presiding.

11:59.636 --> 12:04.307
Oh! Hopefully we have something
sexy today, like a murder or a kidnapping.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.227
A conservatorship hearing?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.939
Oh, man, I wish someone would murder
or kidnap me right now.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.399
To see if a person meets
the legal standard for stupidity,

12:14.400 --> 12:18.445
I mean mental incompetency,
we use what we call the Gilligan Scale.

12:18.446 --> 12:22.241
At first, I thought Jeff Fischer was more
of a Rose from the <i>Golden Girls.</i>

12:22.242 --> 12:24.868
But after further examination,
I can confidently say

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
he and Gilligan are a perfect match.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.874
Objection! That scale is absurd!

12:30.875 --> 12:31.960
Knock knock!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.335
Who's there?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.878
- O.
- "O" who?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.630
"O"-verruled!

12:36.631 --> 12:37.715
And that's lunch.

12:38.466 --> 12:43.345
I have here a sworn affidavit
from a pillar of our community.

12:43.346 --> 12:46.974
I'm talking about Tom
from the grocery store now.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.184
It's a list of things Jeff Fisher

12:49.185 --> 12:52.355
has slipped on in the last year alone.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.692
Forty-seven banana peels,
16 different soup cans,

12:56.693 --> 12:58.902
a recently unmopped floor--

12:58.903 --> 13:00.238
I can't take any more of this!

13:00.405 --> 13:01.863
Oh, ho-ho!

13:01.864 --> 13:03.740
This is getting good.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.411
Your Honor, my family is not concerned
with Jeff's wellbeing at all.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.745
They just want his money.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.415
They are the last people
who should be caring for him.

13:11.416 --> 13:15.877
<i>My dad once asked a homeless man to
babysit me while he went go-kart riding.</i>

13:15.878 --> 13:19.464
<i>My mom was kicked out of Lollapalooza
for being too naked.</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:23.468
And my brother Steve, well,
his Etsee reviews speak for themselves.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.846
One star.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.306
The buyers thought
Toshi was Tilda Swinton.

13:27.307 --> 13:31.102
And furthermore, they live with a fish
who was at January 6th!

13:32.353 --> 13:35.981
I was just going to see the pandas
at the zoo and got all turned around!

13:35.982 --> 13:37.942
Order! I've heard enough!

13:38.192 --> 13:39.735
But I want to take the stand!

13:39.736 --> 13:43.281
- Not a good idea, babe.
- No, it's a great idea.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.408
- Whoa!
- If he lands on his head,

13:46.409 --> 13:48.745
I grant conservatorship.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.039
- Conservatorship granted!
- No!

13:52.040 --> 13:54.541
- But not to the greedy family.
- Oh, thank God!

13:54.542 --> 13:57.836
And not to you either.
You thought this was a basketball court!

13:57.837 --> 14:00.756
There's only one person
that's right for this job.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.634
And she happens to be my AA sponsor
and my financial advisor.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.054
Hey! Damn it, the door's stuck!

14:07.055 --> 14:09.264
Open this door! I'm missing my
big entrance moment--

14:09.265 --> 14:10.725
Argh!

14:14.437 --> 14:15.437
What's happening?

14:15.438 --> 14:17.481
Don't worry.
I'm going to take great care of you

14:17.482 --> 14:21.026
and all your gorgeous gobs
and gobs of money. Come on!

14:21.027 --> 14:22.903
No, I don't want to!

14:22.904 --> 14:25.281
- What about babe?
- I'm your babe now.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.157
Damn it,

14:27.158 --> 14:29.951
how is this thing stuck again?
From the inside?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.370
Where does it even lock from--

14:31.996 --> 14:34.290
Oh, Jeff, you opened it.
You're a genius.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.381
Hey, babe.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.926
- Right on time, Hayley.
- This has got to stop.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.928
You can't keep Jeff prisoner like this.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.472
Prisoner? Please. Look at his view!

14:50.473 --> 14:54.351
It's a casino prison penthouse,
just like Britney Spears.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.395
This is nothing like that!

14:57.021 --> 14:59.022
Although I do have him performing

14:59.023 --> 15:01.317
in a song-and-dance revue
in the casino theater.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.360
Look at him, he's miserable.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.736
It's just a tummy ache.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.280
He won't stop eating
the glitter bombs from the show.

15:07.281 --> 15:11.076
Plus, he's anxious to start this
conjugal visit you demanded. Chop-chop!

15:11.077 --> 15:12.744
Can we please have a little privacy?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.121
Oh, of course. Sorry. Sorry.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.373
Hey, goons! Get out!

15:19.544 --> 15:20.545
Whenever you're ready.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.927
Well, the SUV's back.
Cost me our monthly nut to fix it.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.346
Looks like Shakira's funeral
will have to wait until we can save up.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.473
Ugh, I feel awful.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.685
Of course you do.
We were this close to the sweet life!

15:36.686 --> 15:38.645
No, it's not that.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.898
Could it be that maybe we feel bad
about what we did to Jeff?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.651
- Yeah.
- No. I mean, maybe?

15:43.985 --> 15:46.069
It's Hayley, split!
Uh, sorry, reflex.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.237
How's Jeff?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.072
Stop acting like you care.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.908
It's your fault
Jeff got taken away from me.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.453
Oh, Hayley, we're so sorry.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.581
We didn't want this.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.707
We just wanted lots of new stuff.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.460
We want to make this right
and bring Jeff home.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.505
Well, there is something
you can help with.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.510
<i>♪ You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain ♪</i>

16:10.052 --> 16:11.678
<i>♪ Too much love drives a man... ♪</i>

16:11.679 --> 16:13.555
No, no. Stop!
Stop the music, Jeff.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.890
It's all wrong.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.641
Whoa, those things are dangerous.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.769
Hold the balls, hold the flaming balls.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.022
Jeff, opening night tickets
are about to go on sale,

16:22.023 --> 16:24.983
so I need passion in those eyes,
and all I'm getting is fear.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.651
It's so off-putting.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.905
Hold on a second. Go for Suzy.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.947
Can I go home today?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.450
Protesters chanting "Free Jeff"?

16:33.451 --> 16:35.118
That could be very misleading.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.996
Tickets to see Jeff start at $27.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.206
Goons, with me!

16:39.207 --> 16:41.876
And don't let me catch you
eating any more glitter bombs.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.506
Even better on the way up.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.552
Free Jeff! Free Jeff! Free Jeff!

16:52.011 --> 16:54.596
You guys better get outta here,
or at least buy tickets.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.683
We're not going anywhere
until you let Jeff go!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.059
Free Jeff!

16:59.060 --> 17:02.187
You fools are no match for--
Wait, only four Smiths?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.438
- Where's the girl?
- Ha!

17:03.439 --> 17:05.732
You fell for it!
This was Hayley's ruse.

17:05.733 --> 17:09.694
She's inside freeing Jeff.
Oh, you got rused so hard!

17:09.695 --> 17:11.321
- Stan!
- Did I say that too early?

17:11.322 --> 17:12.448
To the getaway car!

17:12.990 --> 17:14.825
Goons, we got to get to Jeff now!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.119
Are you friggin' kidding me?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.580
Hold on, I'mma get it this time.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.291
Don't you try and help me, Frankie.
Don't you dare!

17:23.542 --> 17:24.876
Jeff! Come with me, hurry!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.420
There's a loophole to get you
out of the conservatorship.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.714
But we've gotta get you
across state lines to do it.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.799
Huh.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.802
A whole new life in West Vagina.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.555
Exactly. Let's go.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.640
Let's roll!

17:40.351 --> 17:41.726
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

17:41.727 --> 17:44.396
I thought you got this damn jalopy fixed!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.730
Jeff, this is all your fault!

17:45.731 --> 17:47.983
If you'd only bought me
that car I asked for--

17:47.984 --> 17:49.277
Dad! Are you serious?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.611
Look!

17:51.612 --> 17:52.946
It's a Goobotti!

17:52.947 --> 17:54.740
I've never seen one this close.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.535
It's... It's gorgeous.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.793
Okay, I'm just gonna say
what everyone's thinking.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.003
Jeff owes us.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.088
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:09.338 --> 18:11.423
<i>♪ Let me tell you 'bout... ♪</i>

18:11.424 --> 18:12.508
No, Klaus!

18:12.883 --> 18:14.134
We gotta get Jeff out of here.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.927
I'm not so sure about that.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.680
I've got those
conservator forms somewhere.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.015
This is extortion.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.642
This is-- Jeff?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.521
Whoa!

18:28.691 --> 18:30.568
Oh, God!

18:30.693 --> 18:33.613
It was beautiful but it stings so bad!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.825
Keep going, Jeff!
I'll fight 'em off!

18:43.664 --> 18:47.668
Like my reviews on Etsee say,
"Bad. Very bad!"

18:57.094 --> 18:59.972
Look! There's money...
I mean Jeff!

19:04.685 --> 19:06.062
Jeff! Give me your hand!

19:09.398 --> 19:12.068
Let's get all the boring paperwork
out of the way first, huh?

19:14.320 --> 19:15.446
Everybody hold onto me!

19:19.325 --> 19:20.575
Steve, switch places with me.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.579
No!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.416
Stan, do something!

19:28.417 --> 19:30.461
I'm comin', Shakira!

19:31.796 --> 19:32.797
Got you!

19:33.130 --> 19:34.173
Climb up!

19:40.471 --> 19:42.931
Okay, I can sign the form now.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.059
Jeff, don't sign anything
or they'll control you.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.185
I don't care.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.645
I just want to go home.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.439
You still wanna live with them?

19:50.898 --> 19:52.774
They're the only family I've ever had!

19:52.775 --> 19:54.317
I don't want to lose them!

19:54.318 --> 19:56.778
That's why I tried to get rid
of the money.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.946
Get rid of the money?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.324
Yeah, I knew those investments
were stupid.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.160
But I was afraid we'd use
the money to buy a house!

20:03.911 --> 20:06.038
I don't want to move away from my family.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.166
Oh, Jeff, we're so sorry.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.669
It doesn't matter
that you don't contribute...

20:12.670 --> 20:14.714
He literally just saved your lives.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.589
Contribute money, Hayley.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.552
Jeff, what you contribute is you.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.888
You're free to spend your money however
you want.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.014
Yeah, about that.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.099
There's no money.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.143
- What?
- Turns out I know nothing

20:28.144 --> 20:29.561
about casino management.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.605
My blackjack tables
were paying out a thousand to one!

20:32.606 --> 20:35.985
I think I'm bad with money.
But I guess we could sell the casino.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.288
Or not. Most likely not.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.167
This one's on the house, Jeff.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.468
It's back!

21:00.926 --> 21:01.927
Shit.
