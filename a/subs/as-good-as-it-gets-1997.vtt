00:27.900 --> 00:31.900
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

00:32.100 --> 00:38.000
It's tulip season today
and I'm so happy.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.300
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.400
Come on, sweetie.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.400
Come on now, sweetheart.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.500
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.800
Come on, go for a ride.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.000
No! Freeze!

01:11.300 --> 01:13.800
Leg down! Leg down!

01:14.600 --> 01:17.700
That's it. Come on.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
No! You monkey-eared son of a ...

01:24.200 --> 01:28.900
You have pissed your last floor.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.800
I'll bet you wish
you were a real ...

01:33.900 --> 01:37.200
You dog-eared monkey.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.700
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.200
Verdell?

01:55.400 --> 01:58.400
Verdell?

01:59.800 --> 02:03.200
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

02:04.100 --> 02:07.000
Come here, sweetheart.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.000
Mr. Udall?

02:12.500 --> 02:16.900
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

02:19.100 --> 02:26.200
My dog. You know ...
My dog with the adorable face.

02:26.400 --> 02:32.600
- Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

02:32.700 --> 02:37.300
I thought it was that coloured man.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.900
Which colour was that?

02:42.000 --> 02:46.300
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.700
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

02:49.800 --> 02:54.500
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

02:54.700 --> 02:59.600
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

02:59.800 --> 03:04.100
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -

03:04.300 --> 03:07.100
- I don't care
where you shove your show.

03:07.300 --> 03:12.100
Are we done being neighbours?

03:15.200 --> 03:20.100
- Let me ...
- No! Not worth it.

03:25.200 --> 03:32.600
- Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.700
One, two, three, four, five.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.500
One, two, three, four, five.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.500
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

04:45.100 --> 04:51.400
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.600
- Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.100
My honey. Where have you been?

05:04.200 --> 05:07.700
Look at my boy.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.700
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.300
Where was my baby?

05:18.500 --> 05:25.900
ln the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

05:26.800 --> 05:32.000
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

05:32.100 --> 05:39.100
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator ...

05:39.300 --> 05:44.600
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

05:47.100 --> 05:52.900
''ln the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven.''

05:53.100 --> 05:56.000
''This is what you live for,
he said.''

05:56.200 --> 05:59.900
''Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval.''

06:00.100 --> 06:04.900
''There is only the safety
of being with each other.''

06:05.000 --> 06:10.800
''How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?''

06:11.000 --> 06:16.500
- Mr. Udall!
- ''She was able to define love.''

06:16.700 --> 06:19.100
''Love was ...''

06:19.300 --> 06:24.900
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.500
- ''Love was ...''
- Are you in there?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.800
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.900
Yes?

06:36.100 --> 06:38.600
This can wait.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.800
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

06:47.300 --> 06:51.400
Well ... That's a load off.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.700
Did you ... do something to him?

06:55.800 --> 07:01.700
Do you realize
that I work at home?

07:01.800 --> 07:06.900
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

07:09.400 --> 07:13.800
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.000
- And put a piece of cardboard ...
- I work all the time.

07:18.100 --> 07:22.300
So never interrupt me!

07:22.400 --> 07:27.200
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -

07:27.400 --> 07:32.200
- and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -

07:32.400 --> 07:37.700
- and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.500
Even then, don't come knocking.

07:41.700 --> 07:47.500
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -

07:47.700 --> 07:53.200
- because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

07:53.400 --> 07:58.300
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -

07:58.400 --> 08:02.500
- and you want someone
to share the moment with.

08:02.700 --> 08:08.200
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.800
Not for any reason.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.700
Do you get me, sweetheart?

08:16.900 --> 08:23.200
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.400
Okay, then.

08:39.100 --> 08:44.500
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.700
''Love was ...''

08:58.500 --> 09:01.500
What was love?

09:01.700 --> 09:05.700
''Love was ...''

09:09.200 --> 09:12.500
Now I'm really pissed!

09:14.500 --> 09:17.100
Don't touch!

09:17.300 --> 09:22.100
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.100
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

09:26.300 --> 09:33.200
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

09:33.400 --> 09:37.400
Assault! And you're black!

09:37.600 --> 09:42.000
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -

09:42.200 --> 09:46.900
- if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

09:49.800 --> 09:55.600
Meantime ... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

09:55.800 --> 10:01.000
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.300
Have a nice day.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.700
Party!

10:25.100 --> 10:29.500
- Don't touch.
- Get a life.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.700
Watch it.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.700
- Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.300
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.100
I'm walking out the door, he says,
''I promise not to get a cough.''

10:53.300 --> 10:57.200
- lsn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.400
I said, ''You love me the way
you love your remote control.''

11:03.600 --> 11:05.700
That's great.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.400
- Eat up!
- I've got your money.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.600
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.800
Excuse me, Melvin.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.600
There you go.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.700
Pardon me.
Take the money.

11:34.900 --> 11:40.900
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

11:41.600 --> 11:46.300
- I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

11:46.500 --> 11:52.000
Spence is more excited about it
than I am.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.900
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to ...

11:56.100 --> 12:00.100
- I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.300
You can sit
at someone else's station.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.100
Or you can wait your turn.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.500
How much more have you got to eat?

12:22.700 --> 12:27.000
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

12:27.100 --> 12:29.900
That's it!

12:30.100 --> 12:32.400
Let's go.

12:32.500 --> 12:37.300
He's barred for life.

12:46.300 --> 12:50.900
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

12:52.600 --> 12:58.400
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.600
I'm going to miss the excitement.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.400
Three eggs, over easy.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.700
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

13:09.900 --> 13:14.100
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.300
You'll die soon, with that diet.

13:17.500 --> 13:23.200
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.600
If you ever mention my son again ...

13:43.800 --> 13:48.900
... you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

13:54.500 --> 14:00.300
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

14:01.300 --> 14:06.400
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

14:10.900 --> 14:14.000
Do you?

14:20.500 --> 14:22.600
Yes ...

14:29.900 --> 14:33.700
I'll get your order.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.000
Wear my earrings tonight.

14:39.700 --> 14:44.500
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

14:49.600 --> 14:55.000
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it ...

14:55.200 --> 14:58.600
I sort of sleep in here.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.200
Don't worry about it.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.400
What?

15:37.300 --> 15:40.300
I don't know.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.900
Grandma ...

15:50.700 --> 15:55.800
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

15:58.100 --> 16:03.500
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything ...

16:03.600 --> 16:07.600
I put these on to give you privacy.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.400
How was dinner?

16:11.600 --> 16:17.200
- How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.500
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.600
I have him ...

16:26.700 --> 16:30.500
- One more spit?
- He's waiting.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.300
Go.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.200
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.

16:37.500 --> 16:42.500
- Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.300
Close the curtains.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.500
No! He can't take smoke.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.300
Magic.

17:10.500 --> 17:15.800
God! That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.900
Come here.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.200
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- ''Little bit of throw-up''?

17:36.100 --> 17:39.700
What shall we do?

17:39.800 --> 17:43.600
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay ...

17:43.700 --> 17:46.700
No. I'll take a cab.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.900
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.900
I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

18:05.100 --> 18:09.300
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.

18:09.400 --> 18:16.400
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

18:17.200 --> 18:20.000
Okay. I just found a model.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.800
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
What's going on?

18:33.700 --> 18:37.400
- Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.800
You picked me up some time ago.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

18:46.200 --> 18:49.800
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

18:49.900 --> 18:54.300
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.100
Who is it, baby?

19:04.800 --> 19:08.100
Who is it, Verdell?

19:10.100 --> 19:13.600
I'm sorry. I told you today.

19:13.700 --> 19:16.700
I was out in the studio and I ...

19:18.100 --> 19:19.800
It's out here.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.400
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

19:23.600 --> 19:28.100
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.700
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your résumé.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.300
This is not a nude.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.700
Just kidding around.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.800
So much for love.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
And yet another pose.

19:48.800 --> 19:55.200
- What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.500
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

20:02.700 --> 20:07.800
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.500
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.300
No direction.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.700
What I do is, I watch.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.800
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

20:29.000 --> 20:33.600
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

20:33.800 --> 20:39.200
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

20:39.400 --> 20:44.900
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

20:45.100 --> 20:50.000
They're just sort of realer
and more alive.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.700
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.600
I know exactly what you mean.

21:07.900 --> 21:12.400
Oh, my God ... Hold it.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.800
Look out.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.900
Excuse me.

21:20.700 --> 21:24.200
I got on the third line of dialogue.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.300
And all of a sudden I blanked.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.500
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

21:29.700 --> 21:34.100
- So he said to me, ''Last chance.''
- Last chance.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.500
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

21:37.600 --> 21:42.000
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.900
He cast me!

21:45.100 --> 21:50.100
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

21:56.700 --> 21:59.500
Can't live without me?

22:01.900 --> 22:06.800
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

22:07.700 --> 22:11.000
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

22:11.100 --> 22:16.500
- It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

22:16.700 --> 22:21.900
''Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out.''

22:24.200 --> 22:29.000
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

22:37.500 --> 22:41.600
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

22:41.700 --> 22:47.800
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection ...

22:49.500 --> 22:53.200
- ls this bothering you?
- No.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -

22:59.200 --> 23:03.100
- where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.600
Nice chatting.

23:07.300 --> 23:10.500
- His name?
- Spencer.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.900
Spence.

23:23.500 --> 23:26.100
It's okay. Go on.

23:35.900 --> 23:38.200
Put on anything you want.

23:38.400 --> 23:42.900
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play!

23:57.900 --> 24:04.600
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.200
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

24:27.300 --> 24:31.300
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

24:31.500 --> 24:36.200
Wait! I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

24:36.400 --> 24:40.100
- Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.600
I'm going to look at the painting.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.900
Where are you going?

24:51.900 --> 24:55.200
Want some water?
What's the matter?

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
You want some water?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.600
Simon, wait!

25:16.100 --> 25:19.400
Why are you doing this?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.600
No, wait ...

25:23.800 --> 25:27.200
- That painting in there ...
- Are you cruising him?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.000
Excuse me ...

25:38.200 --> 25:42.000
- Help me!
- Come on!

25:43.700 --> 25:45.700
Come on.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.600
You call 91 1
and don't leave your name?

26:01.800 --> 26:06.600
- Even a dumb geezer knows ...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.900
Ask him.

26:09.700 --> 26:13.400
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

26:13.600 --> 26:17.600
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

26:17.700 --> 26:24.700
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

26:24.900 --> 26:28.500
Go shake down a 7-1 1
for a day-old wiener.

26:28.700 --> 26:33.200
There's a painting
of one of the guys.

26:35.900 --> 26:41.500
- I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.900
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.900
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

26:50.500 --> 26:54.800
Old bitch. Damn dog.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.800
You're taking him!

27:01.000 --> 27:03.200
Get out of the way!

27:03.300 --> 27:06.400
Even the books.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.200
Wait!

27:09.800 --> 27:13.500
Do you want to say no to me?

27:18.800 --> 27:22.300
I don't want to say nothing to you.

27:22.800 --> 27:29.300
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.700
Thanks for looking after him.

27:34.900 --> 27:41.900
- Hey! Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

27:42.100 --> 27:47.100
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.300
Hey, Frank.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.100
One, two, three, four ...

28:39.900 --> 28:42.600
You're dead.

28:42.700 --> 28:46.600
We don't have no dog food here.

28:46.700 --> 28:51.300
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.900
Don't you do anything!

29:17.700 --> 29:20.200
Where's the trust?

29:29.600 --> 29:33.000
Never a break.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
God!

30:06.900 --> 30:11.700
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

30:11.900 --> 30:15.200
No, we can't reduce the price.

30:15.400 --> 30:20.500
- I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

30:21.700 --> 30:25.100
I'll meet you in there, okay?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.200
Thank you.

30:31.900 --> 30:36.400
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

30:36.600 --> 30:41.200
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and ...

30:49.800 --> 30:55.900
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.600
The scars might ... Oh, shit!

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
Jackie ...

31:08.500 --> 31:11.700
Hand me a mirror, please.

31:19.300 --> 31:23.200
Wait. I have a smaller one.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.500
So how are things, anyway?

31:36.700 --> 31:42.300
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall ... taking care of him.

31:42.500 --> 31:48.200
- How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

31:48.300 --> 31:53.200
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.300
I'm always on the move and ...

31:56.500 --> 31:59.300
Trust me.

31:59.500 --> 32:04.200
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

32:11.100 --> 32:14.500
Waiting gives the devil time.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.900
Oh, my!

32:43.700 --> 32:46.600
Where did I go?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.900
- That's your dog?
- No.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.000
What are you doing with a dog?

32:55.300 --> 33:00.100
- Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

33:02.800 --> 33:06.300
No, not until now.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.400
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.000
Hey, puppy.

33:13.800 --> 33:17.200
It's so cute.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.400
I wonder what breed he is.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.800
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.100
How old are you?

33:34.300 --> 33:37.800
To guess by your eyes ... 50.

33:38.300 --> 33:42.600
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

33:42.700 --> 33:47.100
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

33:47.300 --> 33:52.200
- Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

33:52.400 --> 33:57.000
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.800
What's with the dark?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.400
Dawn patrol.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.400
My son had
a full-blown attack.

34:09.500 --> 34:14.900
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.900
No!

34:18.100 --> 34:22.199
It's bacon for the dog.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.300
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

34:28.400 --> 34:34.900
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

34:43.800 --> 34:48.100
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.700
Look at that dog.

35:03.900 --> 35:08.900
I've got to give you
something real good.

35:09.400 --> 35:13.200
I'm going to show it to you.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.400
Don't be like me.

35:17.500 --> 35:23.300
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.500
I'd like to be treated like that.

35:29.900 --> 35:34.200
Let's go home and do some writing.

35:35.500 --> 35:40.200
''He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.''

35:40.600 --> 35:44.100
''You've saved my life, she said.''

35:45.600 --> 35:49.100
''You'd better make it up to me.''

35:51.900 --> 35:57.900
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.400
62 books. Done.

36:03.100 --> 36:08.600
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

36:08.800 --> 36:13.800
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.800
- Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
And all the laundry.

36:23.200 --> 36:30.000
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.900
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

36:36.100 --> 36:42.500
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

36:54.100 --> 37:00.000
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

37:03.800 --> 37:10.400
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

37:10.600 --> 37:15.200
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

37:15.400 --> 37:20.900
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

37:22.700 --> 37:26.500
Okay.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.300
Hungry? Be right with you.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.700
Mr. Udall.

38:46.200 --> 38:50.600
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like ...

38:50.800 --> 38:54.600
Could you take it ...

38:55.500 --> 38:58.800
... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Thank you.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.100
Verdell.

39:10.500 --> 39:14.700
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

39:14.900 --> 39:18.300
Let's go home and get well.

39:19.400 --> 39:24.400
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.100
Thank you.

39:34.300 --> 39:37.300
Come on, sweetheart.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.800
Verdell, come here.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
I know what you want.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.200
Where's my boy?

39:57.600 --> 40:01.400
No, don't force him.

40:33.100 --> 40:37.600
Over a dog!

40:38.200 --> 40:41.800
Over an ugly dog.

40:48.900 --> 40:53.700
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

41:00.200 --> 41:05.200
- Help!
- You'll make an appointment.

41:05.300 --> 41:09.300
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -

41:09.500 --> 41:12.500
- and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

41:12.700 --> 41:16.100
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

41:16.300 --> 41:21.700
- What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility ...

41:21.900 --> 41:25.900
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

41:26.100 --> 41:30.100
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

41:30.300 --> 41:34.200
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.700
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

41:40.100 --> 41:42.500
No, we're not doing this now.

41:42.700 --> 41:47.800
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.400
No. Nope.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.400
What if this is
as good as it gets?

42:16.200 --> 42:19.400
What the heck are those for?

42:21.300 --> 42:24.500
No, no, no. Get Carol.

42:24.600 --> 42:30.500
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.100
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

42:37.300 --> 42:41.400
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

42:41.600 --> 42:47.200
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.400
I'll pay whatever you want.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.100
Do it!

42:57.700 --> 43:01.200
Bryan. Code blue.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.900
Out! Just shut up and get out.

43:11.600 --> 43:17.800
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.300
Go get Carol.

43:22.800 --> 43:28.000
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

43:28.200 --> 43:33.300
This day has been a disaster.

43:34.100 --> 43:37.900
- I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!

43:38.900 --> 43:45.400
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.700
See you.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.100
It's about time.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.500
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

44:21.200 --> 44:25.000
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.300
I'm hungry.

45:18.500 --> 45:21.800
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

45:21.900 --> 45:26.100
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing ...

45:26.200 --> 45:29.600
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

45:31.800 --> 45:37.400
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

45:37.600 --> 45:42.600
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

45:42.700 --> 45:48.700
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

45:54.500 --> 45:58.300
Yes, I do.

45:59.100 --> 46:04.900
And to prove it ... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

46:05.700 --> 46:10.000
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

46:12.100 --> 46:15.500
You don't look sick.

46:16.100 --> 46:19.800
Just tired and bitter.

46:21.800 --> 46:25.000
My son is sick.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.400
What about your mother?

46:30.900 --> 46:36.500
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

46:36.600 --> 46:40.700
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.100
How are you doing?

46:57.800 --> 47:00.100
You should answer me.

47:00.300 --> 47:05.100
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.500
Back to life.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.800
What's wrong?

47:20.900 --> 47:27.200
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand ...

47:30.000 --> 47:34.000
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

47:36.100 --> 47:39.400
Look out, you guys!

47:40.500 --> 47:44.900
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.200
Melvin! Wait!

47:50.200 --> 47:53.200
Melvin! Wait!

47:58.800 --> 48:02.100
Shut up, kids!

48:02.700 --> 48:05.800
Give us a lift, would you?

48:09.900 --> 48:13.300
Cover your mouth when you cough.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.600
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

48:21.100 --> 48:26.400
- Any chance you'll be back today?
- No! Stay away from me.

48:30.900 --> 48:36.700
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to ...

48:37.100 --> 48:41.500
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

48:43.300 --> 48:46.100
Sorry.

48:48.900 --> 48:54.000
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.000
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

49:00.200 --> 49:05.500
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

49:05.700 --> 49:07.400
SlMON, YOU'RE BROKE

49:14.200 --> 49:19.100
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

49:19.200 --> 49:24.200
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.300
But they'd feel strange calling you.

49:28.500 --> 49:33.100
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.300
Come here.

49:36.500 --> 49:40.400
Verdell? What's wrong?

49:40.600 --> 49:45.100
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

49:45.300 --> 49:50.300
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

49:50.400 --> 49:53.200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

49:53.300 --> 49:56.100
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.900
Sorry ...

49:59.400 --> 50:04.800
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

50:07.400 --> 50:11.400
Oh, my God!

50:41.300 --> 50:45.700
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate ...

50:45.800 --> 50:52.700
I need this.
Just say, ''Melvin, I'll try.''

50:55.500 --> 50:59.400
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

50:59.600 --> 51:06.000
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

51:06.100 --> 51:12.000
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

51:19.800 --> 51:27.300
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

51:27.500 --> 51:31.700
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

51:31.900 --> 51:34.500
What does it mean to you?

51:34.800 --> 51:39.400
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

51:40.600 --> 51:43.100
God, this is like a nightmare.

51:43.800 --> 51:47.900
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

51:51.200 --> 51:55.500
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

51:55.700 --> 52:00.300
And I take away reason
and accountability.

52:31.700 --> 52:34.100
- Mom!
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.

52:34.300 --> 52:37.500
- Please, what?
- I'm ...

52:37.700 --> 52:40.300
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.

52:40.500 --> 52:45.400
- Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.500
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

52:50.600 --> 52:53.400
I'm home.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.900
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

52:59.100 --> 53:02.300
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

53:02.500 --> 53:05.500
Okay, doctor?

53:05.700 --> 53:09.400
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

53:09.600 --> 53:14.900
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

53:15.100 --> 53:19.400
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

53:19.700 --> 53:23.600
- ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

53:23.800 --> 53:26.300
Excuse me.

53:27.800 --> 53:32.100
- I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

53:32.300 --> 53:38.700
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

53:38.900 --> 53:45.100
- Did you say ''today''?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.500
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

53:51.700 --> 53:57.400
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.700
- And how he felt.
- Good.

54:00.900 --> 54:05.500
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

54:05.700 --> 54:08.400
Have they done blood tests?

54:08.600 --> 54:12.400
- When he was well?
- No.

54:12.500 --> 54:15.800
- And how about skin testing?
- No.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
- No standard scratch test?
- No.

54:19.200 --> 54:24.800
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

54:26.200 --> 54:29.300
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

54:31.400 --> 54:35.000
- I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

54:37.200 --> 54:43.500
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

54:43.700 --> 54:47.400
Me.
My home number is on the card.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.500
His home number.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.900
- What?
- Your home ...

55:03.600 --> 55:09.200
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

55:09.400 --> 55:13.300
Couple of female slaves?

55:13.400 --> 55:18.200
There's still a lot of tests
I need to do.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.200
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -

55:22.300 --> 55:27.300
- from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

55:35.700 --> 55:38.000
Doc!

55:42.500 --> 55:46.600
That's good.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.900
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll ...

55:56.200 --> 56:00.200
The costs
are going to be considerable.

56:00.400 --> 56:05.300
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.900
That's wonderful.

56:14.200 --> 56:17.700
Thank you for everything, Nora.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.300
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

56:30.800 --> 56:36.300
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

56:38.300 --> 56:40.300
No!

56:55.000 --> 56:59.200
- ls he dead yet?
- No.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.200
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

57:06.500 --> 57:12.800
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

57:14.000 --> 57:20.200
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

57:21.500 --> 57:26.800
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

57:26.900 --> 57:31.900
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

57:32.100 --> 57:36.700
Did you learn to talk like this in
a ''Sailor, wanna hump-hump''-bar?

57:36.900 --> 57:40.100
Or is this your last shot
at his whisky?

57:40.300 --> 57:44.700
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

57:52.800 --> 57:58.700
No! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

57:58.900 --> 58:04.200
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

58:04.600 --> 58:09.600
This lets a crazy man
into our lives.

58:12.300 --> 58:15.600
You know how this will turn out.

58:15.800 --> 58:20.900
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.900
Right?

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

58:38.900 --> 58:42.800
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

58:43.500 --> 58:45.600
Bye.

58:46.200 --> 58:48.200
Bye-bye.

58:52.100 --> 58:54.400
What a day ...

58:54.700 --> 58:57.800
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.700
Thank you for walking him.

59:02.700 --> 59:08.100
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

59:08.300 --> 59:10.500
Go away.

59:10.800 --> 59:16.100
- This cleaning lady doesn't ..?
- Please, just leave.

59:17.700 --> 59:22.600
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!

59:28.000 --> 59:31.400
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

59:32.900 --> 59:37.700
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

59:38.800 --> 59:44.700
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

59:44.900 --> 59:48.000
You'll be back on your knees
in no time.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.000
ls this fun for you?

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:06.600
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.700
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.400
And I won't.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.900
I don't want to paint any more.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.500
The life I was trying for, is over.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:27.500
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:33.500
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.600
Terrified!

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.300
I was trying to give you a boost.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.200
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.700
You absolute horror
of a human being.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.400
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.100
Get out.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.400
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.200
It's a trick.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.500
I keep bacon in my pocket.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.300
See?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.900
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.600
Come here, Verdell.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.000
Come on.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400
Come here.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.500
Just a stupid dog.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:26.800
Could you leave now? Please?

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.500
I don't get it.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800
Mr. Udall!

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.100
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:30.500
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.200
If you ...

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:48.800
- If it's about thanking me ...
- That's not why I'm here.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.200
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:01.000
Note. Put it in a note.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.000
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.400
- So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.300
I'm worried you did this ...

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.400
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.300
Look ...

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.500
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.800
Clear what up?

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.400
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.900
Not ever!

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.800
I'm sorry, but ...

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:34.200
... we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:41.200
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.700
Just ... thank you.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:56.300
So you will be at work tomorrow?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.300
Yes.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.500
''Never'', she said.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.300
I took a chance you were up.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.900
I brought you some Chinese soup.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.300
Thanks.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.500
I've never been this tired
in my life.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.800
I haven't been sleeping.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:26.399
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.899
I'm in trouble.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.200
It's not just the tiredness.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:40.899
- Sick. Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:47.300
Everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.300
You can barely find the will
to complain.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:59.000
I'm glad we did this.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.899
Good talking to you.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:16.899
- Still writing that thank-you note?
- How do you spell ''conscience''?

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.500
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.899
Look, I got Sean to babysit
so we could go out.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.899
I don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.200
Spencer's okay. Start finding
something to do with your free time.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:39.800
Sean, are you hungry?

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.100
We got pizza. Sausage, pepperoni.
You want to make this later?

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.399
We are going out, like people do.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.700
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little, -

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:06.000
- then you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.500
I don't need one.
I know what's going on here.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:18.300
I must finish this letter first.
This can't be right? Con-science?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.300
Carol!

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.500
What?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.600
It's very weird not feeling that ...

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.600
... stupid panic thing inside me.

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:56.100
Without that,
I start thinking about myself.

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.800
And what good
does that ever get anybody?

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.000
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.000
And I felt myself ...

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.900
... giving them a dirty look.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.500
I just had no idea.
Everything was ...

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.100
Go ahead.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:34.700
Moving in the wrong direction.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:41.800
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man ...

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.300
... to hold fucking ...

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.400
... hands with.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:12:00.400
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:09.000
Which is probably why I make Spence
hug me more than he wants to.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:15.900
He has to make up for
his Mom not getting any.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.000
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:31.200
Leave me be.
What is it you want?

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:37.700
Does getting me thinking about all
that's wrong have some purpose?

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.900
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.700
- What?
- I want us to go out.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
- Thank you.
- I'll send you a thank-you note.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:28.900
That's why you brought me here?

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.400
That's why you brought me here?

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:37.200
Well, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:41.300
But the dog did throw up
twice last night.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.900
- Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.300
- They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it ...

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.600
Sorry.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:58.700
- This is for later.
- What's this?

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.700
- It's a note.
- A note?

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.400
- A thank-you note.
- No thank you.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:12.300
- You can read it later.
- No thank-you note. No, no.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.300
Thank you.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:30.600
- She's nice.
- Yeah, really nice.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.900
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, ''No thanks required''?

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.500
Sure looks like it went over, too.

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.200
Look at you.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.700
You're making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.500
- What?
- You think I'm a mark ...

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.700
You helped with the dog. I'm as
concerned about Simon as you are.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.900
- Concerned?
- He needs more than money.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:14.900
He must go to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.900
They have to help. It's the rules.

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.800
That's great. Let them help him.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.700
Only ...

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:32.200
... I got a painter coming through,
so I'm out.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.900
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.000
Take my car? A convertible.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.400
- Do you drive?
- Yes. But I'm not doing it.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.400
Getting loud.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.200
- He wants me to take his car ...
- I want your problems.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.000
Somebody offers me a convertible
so I can get out of this city ...

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.600
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.300
I'll take him. Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.600
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.900
If there's some health foundation
for people like you, let me know.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.300
- Last-word freak.
- Good luck, lady.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.900
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.500
I'm going to give my queer neighbour
a lift to Baltimore.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:05.500
What I did for you ...
It's working out?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.700
What you did changed my life.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.800
No!

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.800
No thank-you note.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:23.400
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life -

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:29.000
- is that you have done more
for my mother, my son ...

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.900
... and me
than anybody else ever has.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.600
I'm just going to read you
this part of it

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.400
''That makes you the most generous
person I ever met in my life.''

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.200
''And you're going to be
in our daily prayers, forever.''

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.700
Lovely.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:57.300
I also wrote one part ...
I wrote that I was sorry.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.700
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you -

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.100
- when you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:14.800
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I'm sorry for that night ...

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.500
... when I said that I was never ...

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:25.200
I'm sorry for every time your food
was cold and you had to wait.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:32.400
And I'm sorry for never spotting the
human being that did this for us.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.800
I'll just start from the beginning.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.500
''I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you.''

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:47.300
''The word grateful doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel.''

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
That's nice of you. Thank you.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.800
Thank you.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.000
Now I want you
to do something for me.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm sorry. Didn't I say ''what''?
I thought I did.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.900
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.700
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:44.200
He might pull the stiff one-eye
on me. I need you to chaperone.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.800
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook. Two days.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.800
- I can't. My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:04.900
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:11.200
- I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:16.100
ls there any other way to see it?

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.000
No.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:30.200
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.900
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.300
- You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.800
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:19.300
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you're going to say.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.800
I mean ... I think I know.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:30.100
- I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.200
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500
Maybe ...

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.800
- Yes. Let's ... Let's.
- Okay.

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:55.800
- What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.300
Okay, then. Goodnight.

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.800
- Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:16.300
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.700
Lip kiss.

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:28.200
I love you. I'll miss you ...
Real sensitive.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.400
- Bye.
- Call when you're settled.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.400
- Have a good time.
- Don't run!

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.600
Have fun, but don't run.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:58.200
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you.
- So am I, Frank.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.200
Give me a hug.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.900
Everything's going to be okay.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:10.700
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.000
Hello.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.600
Thank you for being on time.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:36.900
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.300
Holy God. Who did that to you?

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.900
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.900
And I was hospitalized.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk later.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.800
- I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.900
- There's no place cards.
- You need room.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.100
So I'll sit in the back.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.900
Never a break. Never.

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.700
Thank you. It was very thoughtful.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.500
- You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.500
Thanks.

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:55.500
Thank you.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.700
You're welcome.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.100
I've got the whole trip programmed.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.200
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.300
TO USE AS lCEBREAKER

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.500
We've got good stuff here.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.300
I like this music.

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.400
I like this music.

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:02.900
I'm sure
they did something really off.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:10.200
But something will always be off
for you, unless you set it straight.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.800
And maybe this thing happened to you
to give you a chance to do that.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.800
Nonsense. You want to know why?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.100
Anyone interested in what Melvin
has to say, raise their hand.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.900
Want to know
what happened with my parents?

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:42.000
- When I was ...
- Wait. I'm going to pull over.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.800
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.900
She was sort of fabulous about it.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:27:01.300
She ... I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.800
And she was very natural.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.500
So she used to pose nude for me.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.400
I always thought
that my father knew about it.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.400
- This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:21.500
- Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop!

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.100
Go ahead. Don't let him stop you.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.300
One day he walked in and found us.
And he started screaming.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.600
My father didn't come out
for 1 1 years.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.600
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:52.700
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.200
Please, come on.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.300
He was ...

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:04.400
I was defending my mother.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:11.100
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:16.200
I said,
''She's not naked. It's art.''

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.600
And he started hitting me.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.300
He beat me unconscious.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:33.000
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.500
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:44.800
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:51.400
A big sweaty wad of money.

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.500
And he said, ''I don't want you
to ever come back.''

01:28:57.700 --> 01:29:01.700
I just grabbed him
and I hugged him.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:05.700
And he turned and walked out.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:21.300
- We all have these stories.
- It's not true.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.400
Some of us have great stories.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.500
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.700
No one here. But a lot of people.
That's their story ...

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:41.500
Good times, noodle salad.
It's not that you had it bad, -

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:46.300
- but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:51.300
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.400
Not it at all?

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.200
Let's go to the hotel.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:06.100
You'll see if you can get another
wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.500
Can I ask you a personal question?

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:24.100
Sure.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.400
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:36.000
- Wouldn't your life be easier ..?
- You consider your life easy?

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.900
I give you that one.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.200
Nice packing.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:59.700
- Hey, Spence.
- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:04.200
- Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, lscored a goal.

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.300
- You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:13.000
That's great.
Oh my God!

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.600
- We're playing again. Got to go.
- Wait ...

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.600
- He scored a goal.
- I don't believe it.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.900
You would have died.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.700
My son was outside playing soccer.

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:38.000
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.700
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.100
No.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.800
All right.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:56.100
- Are you sad or something?
- No. I'm nervous.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:02.400
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:19.900
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.300
Let's get dressed.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:38.100
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.000
All set?

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.900
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.200
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.700
Good evening.

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.800
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.800
- You can answer.
- Yes, we do.

01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.900
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.400
They require a tie and jacket.

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:21.200
No. I'm not putting that on. And I
won't let you inject me with plague.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:26.500
It's a nice place. You dry-clean
these all the time, don't you?

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.800
I don't think so.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.100
You just wait here.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.600
Good evening.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.700
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.200
- No?
- That one.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.000
And this tie.

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:22.900
Excuse me.

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:31.600
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:38.100
- Should I get her for you?
- No. I'll just watch.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.600
Ma'am ...

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.300
You look so se ...

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.000
You look great.

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.400
You look great.

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:28.400
You want to dance?

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.400
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:34.900
No.

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.800
I don't get this place.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.500
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.000
What? Wait.
Where are you going? Why?

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.900
I didn't mean it that way. Sit down.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.300
- Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:08.400
I need one. Quick.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:12.600
What you just said hurt my feelings.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.600
The minute someone gets that they
need you they threaten to walk out.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.400
A compliment is
something nice about somebody else.

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.200
Now or never.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.700
And mean it.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.100
Can we order first?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.300
Two hard-shell crab dinners ...
Pitcher of cold beer.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.800
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.800
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.300
I'll tell your waiter.

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:24.100
I've got a great compliment for you.
And it's true.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.600
- I'm afraid it's something awful.
- Don't be pessimistic.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:38.200
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.200
I've got this ... ailment.

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:52.000
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to, -

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:58.000
- says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases a pill really helps.

01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:02.000
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:07.000
I'm using the word ''hate'' here
about pills.

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:12.700
My compliment is, the night you came
over and told me you would never ...

01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.100
All right, you know what you said.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.600
My compliment to you is, -

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.900
- the next morning
I started taking the pills.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.000
How is that a compliment for me?

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:44.900
You make me
want to be a better man.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.400
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:09.600
Maybe I overshot a bit
to keep you from walking out.

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:27.000
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.100
It's little by little.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.000
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:06.000
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.300
Never.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.000
Here's the trouble with never.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:38.700
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:44.700
When I first saw you
I thought you were handsome.

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:49.100
Then, of course, you spoke.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:57.100
So now that your ...
soft underbelly is all exposed ...

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:02.400
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.400
Well, I ...

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.900
- That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:21.000
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.100
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.600
I ...

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.800
There's a lot of reasons.

01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:42.700
- If you had sex with Simon ...
- What?

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.300
- That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.900
Like I'm a what ..?
And I owe you what?

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.800
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:02.500
It came out first.

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:06.800
You kiss him ... me ...
You two seemed to hit it off.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.700
Wait. I didn't mean ...
Forget what I said about Simon.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:15.600
- I'll never forget it.
- A mistake.

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.200
It was a mistake.

01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.400
Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
We're unable to take yourcall.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:34.200
- Leave a message.
- Say goodbye ... and thank you.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.500
It's Simon.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.000
I'm in town.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:51.200
You've never been out later than
ten o'clock. Pick up the phone.

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:56.300
Really.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.200
I'm going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:07.400
Or at least
get you to answer the phone.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.100
How are you?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.800
- ls this going to be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.700
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.600
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:42.000
I'm taking a big bath.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.200
Are you okay?

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.400
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my complaints.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.400
- What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

01:45:55.900 --> 01:46:00.900
Can you believe, in our little mix
you're the good roommate?

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.100
Goodnight.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.300
Hold it.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.400
I have to draw you.

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.700
- I have to draw you.
- No.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.400
- I'm more shy than people think.
- I have to.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:38.000
- I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:44.300
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:48.300
The back. The line of you.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.300
You're why cavemen
chiselled on walls.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.500
Cut me a break.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.400
The next thing I know
she's sitting next to me.

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:32.100
It's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.600
I said the wrong thing.

01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.600
Where, if I hadn't, -

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.700
- I could be in bed now
with a woman who ...

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:50.100
If you make her laugh,
you got a life.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:54.100
lnstead, I'm here with you.

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:59.400
No offence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.900
Jameson, soda back.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.800
I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:16.900
No, this is ...
This is great. This is so great.

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.900
My hand won't even keep up.
Hold it.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.800
- I'm just turning.
- But hold that.

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:30.300
My hand's not even bothering me.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.300
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.000
Careful.

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:50.100
PRlVACY

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.800
I'm coming in. It's late.

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:08.000
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.900
Sorry.

01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.500
I didn't know she was still here ...
Did you have sex with her?

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.400
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:31.300
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.300
I just love her.

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.600
How are you doing?

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:06.100
- Mom, hi.
- Hello, Simon.

01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.900
- You were right We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.500
- I'm nota screamer.
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.500
- Yourfatheris not feeling well.
- I can't hear you.

01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:22.900
- Hold on.
- What are you going to do?

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:27.800
- I get why you're angry with me ...
- He's talking to his parents.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:32.600
Listen to me. Truly no grudges.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:37.400
It was odd that you didn't come and
see me when you heard I was hurt.

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.500
- We almost did.
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.100
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:48.500
- I'm working again.
- Good. Aboutmoney ...

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:55.800
No. I'll drop you a line. It's up
to you to make the next move.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.300
He's going to want to stay.
And they'll take a ride to the lake.

01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:06.900
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:13.000
We'll probably have a five-hour
drive. It'll give us a chance to ...

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.100
- I'm coming.
- What about your parents?

01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.100
- No. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:27.500
- You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.300
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:35.300
Carol, a load has been lifted.

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:41.000
- One night wih me.
- You think you're kidding.

01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:50.400
- No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:54.400
Let me see ... Gorgeous.

01:52:55.300 --> 01:53:00.000
Do it. And get the dog picked up. I
can't believe he let it stay there.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:03.000
Goodbye.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.400
Your luck's running.

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:10.700
They sub-let your place.
You're homeless.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:16.500
- Frank's got a line on a new place.
- Where?

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.700
Does it matter?

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.800
No, it doesn't.

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:28.800
I'm fine. Like the hat?

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.700
I'm sorry.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:49.200
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:09.700
- I don't want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:18.500
- This one has a meaning.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.000
Here's the keys to my apartment.

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:49.400
Go up there and wait
and I'll take Carol home.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.100
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:02.400
Can you come here?

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.400
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.000
I don't want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:18.300
You have my number.

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:23.800
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:28.100
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.300
Don't say anything.

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:48.300
I've got to get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:53.000
I think you're going to
have to camp it here.

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.500
There's Verdell!

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:08.300
Mommy and Daddy are home.

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.100
Sorry. You're fun to mess with.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:20.600
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:25.600
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.800
- It's got good light.
- I'm coming.

01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.700
It's nice. Looks good.

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:47.500
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.100
I have to say they did a good job.

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:59.100
It's going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?

01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:08.400
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:19.500
I love you.

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:30.300
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.100
Make yourself at home.

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.000
Anything else in the bag?

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.000
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:57.600
I love my cookbook.

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.800
It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.200
Shark with a bite.
Would you like that, Spencer?

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.100
And some cookies here
called Wasps' Nests.

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:18.000
Where is my big hairy boy?

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:23.000
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:25.300
Sweetheart!

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.900
- Oh, you're in bed.
- No, no.

01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:39.500
I just didn't think Verdell should
get too comfortable sleeping here.

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:43.400
The dog's already comfortable.

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.300
ls this okay?

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:54.800
Hello ... Hi, it's me.

01:58:55.300 --> 01:59:00.600
He took me in.
It's Carol for you.

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.600
- Jackie brought it all over ...
- Just take the dog.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.500
Take the dog.

01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:17.400
- Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.900
- Howare you doing?
- Not so hot.

01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:42.800
- Why? What's wrong?
- Was I sensible or hard on you?

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:49.400
- Maybe both.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:54.200
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer.

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.900
Just listen to me.

01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:01.900
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:07.800
And what I said on the street ...
That was a bad thing to say.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.100
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:19.200
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:26.900
But you do bother me.
And I know it's better for me ...

02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:31.700
... to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:36.400
You're an old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:42.300
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.900
Anyway. Thanks for the trip.

02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.000
Goodnight.

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:59.300
Okay if I say something now?

02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.900
Go ahead.

02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:11.100
I should have danced with you.

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:17.700
Goodnight.

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:41.800
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm coming.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:57.300
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.700
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.700
I'm dying here.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.900
- Because ... you love her.
- No.

02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.300
And you people
are supposed to be sensitive?

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:20.900
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's ''dying here''.

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.800
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.700
- I'll figure it out.
- Please ...

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:36.500
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:43.600
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:47.000
It's better than this.

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:51.600
If you're going to give me hope,
you've got to do better.

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:55.600
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut up.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.800
I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.100
Picking on me won't help.

02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:08.100
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.300
Do you know where you're lucky?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.700
You know who you want.

02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:26.900
I would take your seat any day.
Do something. Go over there.

02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:32.400
Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:36.600
You can do this, Melvin.

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.000
Tell her how you feel.

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.400
- I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.200
- She might kill me if I go there.
- Then stay. I'll read you a story.

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:55.100
The best thing going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself.

02:03:55.300 --> 02:03:59.100
Go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:11.500
Thanks a lot.

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:16.000
Here I go.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.800
What's wrong?

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.600
I forgot to lock the door.

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:54.500
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:57.900
I wasn't asleep.

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:04.300
What a break.

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:08.900
ls it a secret
what you're doing here?

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.100
I had to see you.

02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.600
Because?

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
It relaxes me.

02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:30.600
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb -

02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:35.200
- than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:38.000
That's overstating.

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:44.100
I'd rather be sitting inside so I
don't get my feet in the gutter.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:49.800
Stop. Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:53.700
A regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:57.200
Everybody wants that.
It doesn't exist.

02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:06.000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.300
Boyfriend ...

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:23.500
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:27.900
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:35.000
Maybe we could.

02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:04.900
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:13.400
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:19.400
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse ...

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.400
There's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:30.400
That way we're not screwy,
but two people that like warm rolls.

02:08:54.700 --> 02:09:01.100
- What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:13.300
And darling
I'm neverlonely

02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:17.000
wheneveryou're in sight...

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.800
Thank you.

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:24.600
I was ...

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:43.800
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is won't work.

02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.600
- I'm ...
- What?

02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:59.600
I'm feeling better.

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:06.600
It may seem that way now,
but you don't know me all that well.

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:10.600
I'm not the answer for you.

02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:14.800
- I've got a compliment for you.
- You know what?

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.900
Let me talk.

02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:29.200
I might be the only person
on the earth -

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.400
- that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:40.200
I might be the only one who knows
how amazing you are.

02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:44.700
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:50.100
And in every single thought
you have.

02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:57.000
How you almost always mean something
that's about being straight or good.

02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:02.100
Most people miss that about you.

02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:07.600
I wonder how they can watch you
bring their food and clear tables -

02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:12.100
- and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:17.400
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good ...

02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:22.600
... about me.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.400
ls that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:47.000
No.

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.000
I'm going to grab you?

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.900
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.200
I know I can do better than that.

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:51.600
Better. Definitely better.

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.600
See?

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:17.300
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:28.100
Excuse us.
