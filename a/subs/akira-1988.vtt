"Haruki-ya"

01:57.660 --> 02:01.705
Groups of unemployed workers, who have
grown in number due to the tax reforms

02:01.914 --> 02:05.042
enacted by the former Prime Minister,
are rioting all across the country.

02:05.251 --> 02:08.586
And with the confusion among members
of Parliament sparked by the comments of

02:08.795 --> 02:12.091
Finance Minister Takanashi
during a recent Parliament inquiry,

02:12.299 --> 02:16.595
there seems to be no compromise in sight
between the government and opposition.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.472
Hey. What'll it be?

02:18.681 --> 02:20.850
Give me three peanuts.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.228
Let's see here...

02:38.659 --> 02:41.328
We've herded those
Clown bastards onto Route 5.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.792
Damn it, don't scare me like that!
Open the damn door quietly!

02:47.001 --> 02:50.504
You wouldn't be so jumpy if
you didn't have something to hide!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.425
Try selling some normal
drinks sometime, huh?

02:54.633 --> 02:58.554
How about buying something
for once?! This ain't a hangout!

02:58.762 --> 03:01.056
And drink that dog piss you sell?!

03:04.560 --> 03:08.939
Twin ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

03:09.148 --> 03:14.320
And these are... Computer
controlled anti-lock brakes...

03:14.528 --> 03:17.781
200 horsepower at 12,000 rpm...

03:19.909 --> 03:22.328
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.914
All right, let's go!

03:26.790 --> 03:30.794
That bike's been customized just for me.
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.215
I don't see how you can
ride something like that, man.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.801
I could!

03:38.010 --> 03:41.138
If you want one so bad,
steal a big one for yourself.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.830
Unbelievable.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.916
School kids these days...

04:51.125 --> 04:53.627
Wait! Hey, waiter!

04:56.880 --> 04:59.842
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

05:13.063 --> 05:16.025
This isn't a game, you idiot!

05:18.944 --> 05:20.904
Shit...!

06:24.301 --> 06:25.344
That's--

06:26.387 --> 06:27.930
This is car 375.

06:28.138 --> 06:33.060
We've got reports of biker gangs fighting
near the intersection of Highway 14 south!

06:33.268 --> 06:37.940
Request immediate assistance!
Car 375, en route to the scene!

06:38.148 --> 06:39.525
It's the cops! What should we do?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.861
Damn, and my motor coils
were just getting warmed up...

06:47.950 --> 06:49.451
Bastards...

06:49.660 --> 06:51.537
Let's go, Tetsuo!

06:51.745 --> 06:52.746
Right!

06:52.955 --> 06:54.498
Damn!

07:04.049 --> 07:07.052
A skirmish has broken out
between student protesters

07:07.261 --> 07:10.055
and riot police assigned as security.
There appear to be some casualties.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.473
Furthermore--

07:28.240 --> 07:29.533
What the--?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.704
What the hell's going on?!

07:33.912 --> 07:36.457
Move it, jerk! I'm in a hurry!

07:51.847 --> 07:53.223
What was that?!

07:53.432 --> 07:54.892
Call the police!

08:01.315 --> 08:04.902
Repeal the tax reforms!

08:21.043 --> 08:27.090
This area is off-limits!
Go back! It's dangerous!

08:27.299 --> 08:28.300
Something's strange here...

08:28.509 --> 08:30.177
Let me through! I'm sorry, let me through!

08:30.385 --> 08:32.011
What's the big idea?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.355
Look! Blood!

08:42.022 --> 08:43.232
Who are they?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.525
- Excuse me.
- Hey! Don't push!

08:44.733 --> 08:45.317
Excuse me.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.486
Hey! Watch it, jerk!

08:50.781 --> 08:53.242
Pardon me. I'm sorry.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.660
Ryu!

08:54.868 --> 08:56.662
Hey! He ran away!

09:02.417 --> 09:04.086
He's got a gun!

09:09.383 --> 09:12.928
Fire!

09:13.136 --> 09:15.472
Hold your fire! There's a kid with him!

09:25.440 --> 09:27.901
Run...

09:28.110 --> 09:30.028
Hurry...

09:34.157 --> 09:35.867
Go to Ryu...

09:36.076 --> 09:38.954
Ryu will help you now...

09:42.666 --> 09:46.128
Hurry... Get out of here...

10:17.701 --> 10:18.785
<i>Kai!</i>

10:21.038 --> 10:23.290
What are you doing? Hurry!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.171
He vanished...!

10:37.804 --> 10:40.057
He's to the west.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.477
The west? He's in the old city, then.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.572
Eat this!

11:07.959 --> 11:09.753
Tetsuo!

11:25.394 --> 11:28.689

unrepaired, unrestored Old City area."

11:48.750 --> 11:51.878
Ryu! Ryu, where are you?

11:55.173 --> 11:56.383
Kei!

12:22.951 --> 12:24.161
No, that's--!

12:45.474 --> 12:47.017
How you like that?!

12:56.234 --> 12:58.737
Well? Who is it?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.448
It's not him! It's not Tetsuo!

13:01.656 --> 13:03.450
Okay! Let's go!

13:08.121 --> 13:13.543
You little... What did you do...?

13:26.348 --> 13:29.226
Tetsuo! Hang on! Hey!

13:31.394 --> 13:32.729
Huh? What did you say?

13:32.938 --> 13:34.606
That kid...

13:37.609 --> 13:40.237
He's hurt bad!

13:40.445 --> 13:43.657
Hey! Wait!

13:43.865 --> 13:44.741
We gotta get him to a hospital!

13:44.950 --> 13:48.578
- He needs an ambulance!
- We can't move him!

13:58.088 --> 13:59.923
W-What the hell?!

14:14.271 --> 14:16.231
There's no escape.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.781
We've come for you.

14:30.287 --> 14:36.042
We can't survive on the outside.
Come on, let's go home.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.922
It's the army! Those are army helicopters!

14:47.971 --> 14:49.347
Move out!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.193
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

15:02.402 --> 15:05.113
Um... We're just, uh...

15:05.322 --> 15:07.574
Down on your stomachs!
Spread your arms and legs!

15:17.125 --> 15:19.252
Ow... Damn it, that hurts!

15:19.461 --> 15:20.670
Kai!

15:26.635 --> 15:27.260
Hey!

15:27.469 --> 15:28.428
Sir?

15:28.637 --> 15:29.304
Who are they?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.640
They seem to be an ordinary bike gang, sir.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.283
We're going back.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.077
Ow! Hey, wait a minute!

15:52.285 --> 15:54.079
My arms don't bend that way, damn it!

15:54.287 --> 15:57.290
Load the wounded onto the helicopter!

15:57.499 --> 15:58.416
Tetsuo!

15:58.625 --> 16:01.002
Wait! Where are you taking him?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.754
Kaneda!

16:02.963 --> 16:05.924
What the hell? We didn't do anything!

16:06.132 --> 16:08.009
He's heavy...!

17:08.069 --> 17:14.284
So you and your friends went out at night
on your bikes to visit your dying mother,

17:14.492 --> 17:18.079
and a group of hooligans called
the Clowns picked a fight with you.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.540
They hurt your friend,
so you lost your temper,

17:20.749 --> 17:24.294
which is why eight Clown
members are now in the hospital.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.712
That's your story?

17:26.838 --> 17:28.423
She's cute!

17:29.507 --> 17:30.759
Hey! You can't look at this!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.343
And how's your mother doing?!

17:32.552 --> 17:33.720
Huh? Oh.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.347
Luckily, she made it
through the worst of it last night.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.226
And I suppose she's made it over
the mountains on a bike by now?

17:45.774 --> 17:47.275
It couldn't be these bozos.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.277
You can tell that just by looking.

"#8 Interrogation Room"

17:50.945 --> 17:53.698
Wait on that bench. Understand?

17:53.907 --> 17:56.451
How much longer are
we gonna have to wait?

17:56.659 --> 17:59.245
Okay! The next five, come get in here!

18:01.164 --> 18:08.004
So the army's working with the police to
hunt down anti-government groups now, huh?

18:12.675 --> 18:16.262
- Wanna put up a fight, huh?
- He's holding something!

18:18.306 --> 18:20.100
Bastard!

18:22.102 --> 18:24.854
Long live the freedom revolution!

18:27.857 --> 18:29.109
He's got a grenade!

18:35.865 --> 18:38.076
Crazy son of a bitch!

18:44.791 --> 18:48.044
All right, that's enough! Take him away!

18:48.253 --> 18:50.088
We'll really teach him a lesson later.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.925
You dumb bastard! If you wanna die,
just hang yourself or something!

18:54.134 --> 18:58.680
Hey! You people can go.
We've contacted your school.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.056
What? You son of a--

19:00.265 --> 19:02.559
Hey, hold on a minute, pops!

19:02.767 --> 19:04.144
"Pops"?!

19:04.352 --> 19:06.229
There was one more of us.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.272
What?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.898
Pardon me.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.695
What're you--

19:13.903 --> 19:16.114
This is her. Can she leave with us?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.950
Who are you calling "Pops," you punk?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.243
Ow!

19:20.451 --> 19:24.956
Look here, kid! I'm only 25!
I'm not even married!

19:25.165 --> 19:28.835
So watch your mouth! She can go with you!

19:30.461 --> 19:32.922
Call a doctor!

19:33.131 --> 19:37.635
So I think the army was chasing
that weird kid Kaneda saw...

19:37.844 --> 19:39.721
I think I saw him, too.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.431
And what about Tetsuo?

19:41.639 --> 19:44.017
Why the hell wouldn't they
tell us what hospital he's in?

19:44.225 --> 19:45.602
What did you say?!

19:45.810 --> 19:49.147
I was just wondering if you wanted to
grab some tea or something over there.

19:49.355 --> 19:54.736
I figured we could have a nice,
long talk about that "revolution" deal.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.907
Skirt-chasers will try anything these days...

19:59.115 --> 20:01.826
You'll help anyone so
long as they're a girl, won't you?

20:02.035 --> 20:04.746
No way! I have high standards!

20:04.954 --> 20:07.749
It's not their looks that count.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.753
It's their... I dunno, their
sensitivity that moves me.

20:11.961 --> 20:16.090
I suppose I owe you one.
Thank you very much, uh...

20:16.299 --> 20:17.592
I'm Kaneda. Nice to meet you.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.136
See you around, Kaneda.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.056
You're leaving already? Don't be like that!

20:23.264 --> 20:27.393
Hey, come on! I did save you and all!

20:31.898 --> 20:34.943
At least tell me your name, you bitch!

20:36.861 --> 20:41.074
I'll try talking with them for
the time being, but it's risky.

20:41.282 --> 20:46.412
If they think you're trying to avoid taking
responsibility, it'll blow up in your face.

20:46.621 --> 20:50.250
I can't believe that there's a
mole on the executive council.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.001
Even if that's true...

20:52.210 --> 20:54.045
That isn't important.

20:54.254 --> 20:58.508
What's important is diplomacy and political
maneuvering, which you seem to despise.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.927
I never studied them in school, you see.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.888
In any case, at the next
executive council meeting,

21:04.097 --> 21:09.602
your poor management of this last
incident will be called into question.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.233
There's a phone call for the Colonel.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.029
You should put your affairs in order.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.118
It's me.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.807
This way, Colonel.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.810
I'm terribly sorry to call you here,

21:51.019 --> 21:54.063
but there's something you really must see.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.652
Please observe.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.905
It's the special pattern from that young boy.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.116
It doesn't resemble any I've seen so far,

22:05.325 --> 22:08.244
and I've never seen a developmental
speed or configuration like this.

22:08.453 --> 22:12.915
It may have begun with the shock of
contact with Number 26, or possibly...

22:13.124 --> 22:15.585
Have you finished running a
comparison with Akira's pattern?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.628
I'll superimpose it over this one.

22:22.467 --> 22:27.764
This projection was constructed using
mixed data, so a comparison is difficult,

22:27.972 --> 22:31.934
but I believe this boy's
pattern is the key to solving

22:32.143 --> 22:34.896
the riddle of Akira's pattern growth process.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.689
All right. Continue.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.399
Very well, sir. Thank you.

22:38.608 --> 22:42.195
I'm sure he'll turn out to be a
worthy addition to the Numbers.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.406
It may be rough on him,

22:45.615 --> 22:48.951
but I thought we might try
starting him off with level 7 capsules.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.244
Is it safe?

22:50.453 --> 22:51.496
Leave everything to me.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.748
That's not what I meant!

22:53.956 --> 22:58.753
I'm asking that if he turns out to
have power like Akira's like you said,

22:58.961 --> 23:02.256
will we be able to control it?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.592
Well, that's--

23:04.801 --> 23:06.427
Can I leave this to you?

23:06.636 --> 23:11.891
Well, if we use the latest examination
equipment to collect even more data

23:12.100 --> 23:15.812
and do a multifaceted
analysis, then surely...

23:18.272 --> 23:22.360
Maybe we shouldn't touch that power.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.696
The power of God?

23:27.865 --> 23:30.576
A... ki... ra...

23:30.785 --> 23:36.666
But we have to. We have
to touch it and control it.

23:36.874 --> 23:40.586
If it looks like it's too much for us
to handle, terminate him at once!

23:40.795 --> 23:42.422
There can be no hesitation!

23:42.630 --> 23:44.549
Very well, Colonel.

23:44.549 --> 23:48.094
"Ward 8 Vocational Training School"

23:48.094 --> 23:52.348
If trash like you, that can't keep up with
the academic ability of regular students

23:52.557 --> 23:56.561
and can't adapt to living in a group,
screw up here, it's the end of the road!

23:56.769 --> 24:00.231
Even if you're under 15, if you get more
than 50 penalty points on your record,

24:00.440 --> 24:02.567
you're sent to the regular courts!

24:02.775 --> 24:05.069
Bite me! Don't mess with us, you bald goat!

24:05.278 --> 24:06.696
Aren't any of you listening?

24:06.904 --> 24:09.282
- You lost me halfway through!
- Discipline!

24:09.490 --> 24:10.575
Discipline!

24:10.783 --> 24:11.909
- Discipline!
- Ow!

24:12.118 --> 24:14.412
Discipline! Discipline!

24:14.620 --> 24:15.788
Discipline!

24:15.997 --> 24:17.707
Dismissed!

24:17.915 --> 24:21.544
Thank you very much, sir!

24:22.628 --> 24:25.756
You bastard! You and me are
gonna go at it someday, jack!

24:25.965 --> 24:26.841
We're gonna remember this!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.050
I hope you rot and die!

24:28.259 --> 24:29.802
You sick bastard!

24:30.011 --> 24:31.179
Shit...

24:36.642 --> 24:38.186
Yamagata!

24:38.394 --> 24:40.104
What happened to your cheek?

24:40.313 --> 24:41.439
Shut the hell up.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.399
Let me guess, Jaws from P.E.?

24:43.608 --> 24:46.319
They say you fought the
Clowns on a highway in the old city!

24:46.527 --> 24:46.736
Yeah.

24:46.944 --> 24:50.072
Why don't you just wipe 'em out?
Those guys are so gross!

24:50.281 --> 24:51.699
And last night...

24:51.908 --> 24:53.701
There were demonstrators,
cops, and even the damn army!

24:53.910 --> 24:55.745
And that idiot Tetsuo had an accident, too.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.413
What happened to Tetsuo?

24:57.622 --> 24:59.415
He's in the hospital.
I guess, but we don't know where.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.918
The idiot was trying to show off.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.047
That idiot...

25:06.255 --> 25:08.049
What, you mean Tetsuo?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.052
Shut up! I've had enough
of your damn flirting!

25:11.260 --> 25:13.596
What's gotten into you?!

25:28.486 --> 25:32.156
Tetsuo? It's time for your medication.

25:33.115 --> 25:36.077
Doctor! There's a problem!

25:39.789 --> 25:44.418
I can't. The dorm mother
throws a fit if you go out before 10.

25:44.627 --> 25:47.380
Yeah, the one with the face like a goat.

25:47.588 --> 25:51.425
That old bag's such a pain...
She's always yammering on and on and on.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.178
Tomorrow at three? Sure, that'd be okay.

25:54.387 --> 25:57.557
Hey, what happened
to that girl a while back?

25:57.765 --> 26:01.561
I don't like her much.
Her personality just gets on my nerves.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.521
Kaori...

26:05.273 --> 26:06.941
Tetsuo!

26:07.149 --> 26:11.862
Everyone's been worried about you!
They thought you might be dead.

26:18.035 --> 26:22.415
When I woke up, I was on an
operating table or something.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.625
And that examination...

26:24.834 --> 26:29.171
It's like... they were messing
around inside my head.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.841
I don't want to go back there.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.551
Let's run away...

26:33.759 --> 26:35.845
Where?

26:36.554 --> 26:41.309
Someplace. Someplace far away.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.813
- What's your problem?
- That's mine!

26:46.022 --> 26:46.897
I wanna get laid!

26:47.106 --> 26:48.899
Hey! Today's independent study!

26:49.108 --> 26:53.946
Say what? What about
my burning desire to study?!

26:54.155 --> 26:55.948
Drag his butt in here!

26:57.158 --> 26:58.909
Kaneda! Your bike!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.620
My bike?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.539
Look!

27:06.626 --> 27:08.210
Tetsuo!

27:10.296 --> 27:11.339
Are you sure this is okay?

27:11.547 --> 27:14.050
Shut up! Just keep quiet and hang on!

27:17.470 --> 27:23.351
"Off Limits"

27:25.102 --> 27:25.895
Huh?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.563
What's wrong?

27:29.649 --> 27:30.566
Shit!

27:30.775 --> 27:31.525
Oh, no...

27:31.525 --> 27:36.364
"End the Shimamoto
Labor Union's Illegal Strike! !"

27:36.364 --> 27:39.909
Oh, okay. The engine can't drop below
5,000 even when you're changing gears.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.411
- My butt hurts.
- Okay, I get it...

27:42.620 --> 27:43.996
Look, bikes!

27:45.164 --> 27:46.916
Is that Kaneda and...?

27:47.124 --> 27:49.835
It's not them!

27:52.463 --> 27:53.839
Kaori!

27:57.385 --> 27:58.594
Any sign of him?

27:58.803 --> 28:00.846
Kuwata and the others
went to look around Kisarazu.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.766
All that's left now is the industrial area!

28:03.974 --> 28:06.060
Okay. let's go!

28:08.771 --> 28:12.191
We owe you for the other night!

28:20.408 --> 28:21.951
Shut up!

28:24.745 --> 28:27.123
Kaori! What did they do, Kaori?!

28:33.796 --> 28:39.301
Don't! If you so much as scratch
that bike, I'm gonna kill you!

28:44.890 --> 28:45.933
Run!

28:46.142 --> 28:47.643
Don't let 'em get away!

28:54.400 --> 28:55.818
Wait!

29:05.202 --> 29:06.996
Tetsuo!

29:13.169 --> 29:16.672
"Smash the Strike!!"

29:23.846 --> 29:26.056
That's enough, Tetsuo!
Are you trying to kill him?

29:26.265 --> 29:29.101
Yes! I'm gonna kill him!
I'll split his damn head open!

29:29.310 --> 29:30.895
Knock it off!

29:31.103 --> 29:34.982
This happened because
you took my bike for a joyride.

29:35.191 --> 29:35.900
Enough, already!

29:36.108 --> 29:39.695
Shut up! Don't order me around!

29:39.904 --> 29:41.405
We were worried about you.

29:41.614 --> 29:45.326
Why do you always have
to come and save me?

29:45.534 --> 29:49.914
I could've handled it myself!
I admit I got beat up that one time,

29:50.122 --> 29:53.751
but I won't always be on the receiving end!

29:53.959 --> 29:56.170
Understand?!

30:00.049 --> 30:02.468
Tetsuo...

30:02.676 --> 30:04.929
Shut up! Stay away from me!

30:07.056 --> 30:10.559
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

30:10.768 --> 30:12.561
Leave me alone!

30:14.438 --> 30:15.564
Akira!

30:19.735 --> 30:20.986
Tetsuo!

30:24.073 --> 30:25.449
What's wrong?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.076
Akira!

30:27.284 --> 30:29.161
I don't know who that is!

30:51.642 --> 30:53.811
Tetsuo, are you...

30:54.019 --> 30:55.354
Hey!

30:59.775 --> 31:01.318
This is strange.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.405
I'm getting a blue pattern on scope #3!

31:04.613 --> 31:08.200
Oh, no! Retrieve the subject! Hurry!

31:21.505 --> 31:24.258
What're you doing to my friend?!

31:27.595 --> 31:31.807
What's with you?
You just come back from a funeral?

31:38.188 --> 31:39.523
Tetsuo!

31:39.732 --> 31:41.233
Kaneda!

31:42.484 --> 31:44.278
Shit...

31:53.370 --> 31:54.580
Wait!

32:01.462 --> 32:03.756
Hey, Kaneda...

32:14.892 --> 32:20.189
I see we have some youngsters doing
their thing in spite of the tight checkpoints.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.525
That just means that they're stupid, don't it?

32:27.237 --> 32:31.492
This is boring. Hey, let's go home.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.202
But it's still early!

32:33.410 --> 32:37.206
Yeah, but without their bikes
they're just skirt-chasers out of water.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.415
You mean "fish"!

32:38.624 --> 32:41.961
Come on, let's go. Let's toss these fish back!

32:42.169 --> 32:46.173
Hey, Kaneda, what're we gonna do?

32:48.300 --> 32:49.468
What the--?

32:49.677 --> 32:50.886
Look!

33:17.079 --> 33:18.414
That's...

33:18.622 --> 33:22.376
Here we go again... Let's get out
of here before we get involved again.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.336
Huh?

33:24.545 --> 33:25.462
Kaneda?

33:25.671 --> 33:27.006
Hey!

33:28.298 --> 33:32.386
This area is being cordoned
off due to a terrorist bombing.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.346
Those who wish to get
through, line up in single file,

33:34.555 --> 33:38.517
present your ID and go through the checkpoint.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.695
Get in.

33:49.903 --> 33:53.866
What's wrong? Hurry. I'll be right behind you.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.076
You know the rendezvous point, right?

33:57.077 --> 34:00.456
- Be careful.
- You too, Ryu.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.380
"We're the Clowns"

34:13.552 --> 34:16.096
Stop! Stop, damn it!

34:17.931 --> 34:19.475
She's got a gun!

34:30.902 --> 34:32.987
Okay, that's far enough!

34:33.197 --> 34:34.531
Drop the gun!

34:41.871 --> 34:43.540
Drop it now!

34:49.420 --> 34:51.130
Stop!

35:04.561 --> 35:06.313
I think it came from over here!

35:06.522 --> 35:08.148
- There were two shots!
- No, three!

35:08.357 --> 35:09.900
It's just up ahead!

35:10.109 --> 35:12.736
Hey. Let's get out of here.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.196
Come on!

35:41.932 --> 35:47.771
"Idiot | Moron | Fool | No. 1"

36:20.596 --> 36:21.972
Kaneda!

36:47.623 --> 36:51.585
So, what's the matter?
Try telling me about it.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.421
I had a dream.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.256
A dream?

36:57.799 --> 37:02.763
The city will be covered by a
dark shadow and start to crumble.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.349
Lots of people died...

37:05.557 --> 37:09.728
...and we met Akira again.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.104
Akira?!

37:11.313 --> 37:18.278
The city will crumble,
and so many people will die...

37:18.487 --> 37:22.199
When?! When will it happen, Kiyoko?!

37:22.407 --> 37:25.244
You mustn't let that boy go.

37:25.452 --> 37:28.664
His power, it...

37:35.003 --> 37:35.921
What did she mean?!

37:36.129 --> 37:41.885
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.387
Her medication is normal too.

37:43.595 --> 37:48.058
There's no sign of any abnormalities
in her ECG or EEG, either.

37:48.267 --> 37:53.772
I think what Number 25 said
was her precognitive power at work.

37:53.981 --> 37:58.652
This must be presented to the
supreme executive council for inquiry, but...

37:58.860 --> 38:00.529
Do you believe her?

38:00.737 --> 38:02.990
I have no doubts
regarding Number 25's abilities.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.909
We have all sorts of data
that substantiate her abilities.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.620
What about you, Colonel?

38:08.829 --> 38:13.208
My job isn't to believe or disbelieve.
It's to act or not to act.

38:25.887 --> 38:26.847
Here, sir.

38:27.055 --> 38:31.268
Cold gear, Colonel.
Please put it on. You, too, Doctor.

38:42.612 --> 38:47.200
The other day, a young
researcher asked me something.

38:47.409 --> 38:51.371
He wondered if their power was the form
the next stage of human evolution was taking,

38:51.580 --> 38:56.960
and perhaps that we'll all
be able to control it someday.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.921
Scientists are a bunch of romantics.

39:00.130 --> 39:03.091
Military men always consider the risks first.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.719
It's taken thirty long years.

39:05.927 --> 39:09.765
We've come so far from the rubble.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.933
We can't just trade one for the other.

39:12.142 --> 39:16.730
I've always thought that
you hated this city, Colonel.

39:16.938 --> 39:22.194
The passion to build has cooled
and the joy of reconstruction forgotten,

39:22.402 --> 39:26.156
and now it's just a garbage heap
made up of hedonistic fools.

39:26.365 --> 39:30.077
So you're trying to save the city, then.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.622
It's how a soldier thinks.
A scientist wouldn't understand.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.586
Colonel, we're here.

39:39.795 --> 39:40.879
This way, sir.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.820
Room 10, 148 degrees Kelvin.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.572
Fluctuation tolerance range, check.

40:07.781 --> 40:12.160
Room 9, 118 degrees Kelvin.
Fluctuation tolerance, check.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.038
Emergency power generator, check.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.081
Open it.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.499
Yes, sir.

40:17.707 --> 40:17.999
Uh...

40:18.208 --> 40:19.334
Go to the Control Room!

40:19.543 --> 40:20.752
Yes, sir!

40:37.477 --> 40:43.316
Room 1 is at 0.0005 degrees Kelvin.
It's within tolerances.

40:43.525 --> 40:48.405
No abnormalities detected in any of the
rooms' Dewar Walls or in the defense system.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.242
No abnormal atmospheric
concentrations or reactions recorded.

40:52.451 --> 40:55.203
All systems nominal, then?

41:04.212 --> 41:07.424
Look at what they abandoned
in their panic. They were afraid!

41:07.632 --> 41:09.968
They were too scared,
so they hid it away from the public.

41:10.177 --> 41:12.387
They forgot all shame and honor

41:12.596 --> 41:16.933
and cast off the civilization
and science we had created,

41:17.142 --> 41:21.688
and shut the lid of the Pandora's Box
they themselves had opened.

41:26.193 --> 41:26.735
Ryu!

41:26.943 --> 41:29.070
Hey, we're still young.

41:29.279 --> 41:31.740
I think we can start over.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.158
I'll go with you to the police.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.117
Ryu!

41:34.326 --> 41:35.744
Come on, turn yourself in!

41:35.952 --> 41:37.996
That was the first time you
ever killed somebody, right?

41:38.205 --> 41:38.663
Ryu!

41:38.872 --> 41:41.625
Anyway, once you've
purified your body and soul,

41:41.833 --> 41:44.002
let's go out for tea or something.

41:44.211 --> 41:46.171
Don't kick yourself over it, okay?

41:46.379 --> 41:50.342
What's done is done. The guy's dead.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.434
Who're you?!

41:59.643 --> 42:02.145
Ryu! You're okay!

42:02.354 --> 42:04.773
- Kei, is that you?
- Ryu!

42:05.273 --> 42:07.234
Who's this?

42:07.442 --> 42:08.777
Who, me?

42:08.985 --> 42:14.950
Well, I guess saying I'm Kei's
boyfriend might be stretching it a bit.

42:15.158 --> 42:18.537
But we haven't gotten physical
or anything yet, understand?

42:18.745 --> 42:19.621
- Are you a spy?!
- No!

42:19.829 --> 42:21.498
Liar!

42:25.794 --> 42:27.295
Is he really okay?

42:27.504 --> 42:30.882
All I know for sure is that he's not a spy.

42:31.091 --> 42:32.884
Ow...

42:34.261 --> 42:36.263
Sneak into their lab?!

42:36.471 --> 42:38.890
Are you serious? Don't you
remember the fiasco with that kid?!

42:39.099 --> 42:43.019
Last-minute orders.
Besides, the plan's already in place.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.483
The lab passes that they issue once a week...

42:48.692 --> 42:50.527
They're from Mr. Nezu?

42:50.735 --> 42:51.987
What's the objective?

42:52.195 --> 42:54.781
Detailed data on the new subject.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.408
New subject?

42:56.616 --> 43:03.582
Yes. Last week, on the night we tried
to abduct the subject called Number 26,

43:03.790 --> 43:08.420
a boy who was in an accident on an
old city highway was brought to the lab.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.047
Looks like he's a student
at a vocational training school.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.759
But he's now their new subject
for human experimentation.

43:18.597 --> 43:19.639
Ow!

43:19.848 --> 43:23.226
Ow! What's the big idea?!

43:23.435 --> 43:24.227
You!

43:24.436 --> 43:25.812
He heard us! Let's kill him!

43:26.021 --> 43:26.563
Ryu!

43:26.771 --> 43:30.609
W-Wait a minute! Listen to me!
Listen to what I have to say!

43:30.817 --> 43:31.735
He saved me!

43:31.943 --> 43:33.069
Twice!

43:33.278 --> 43:35.155
Maybe it was just to get close to us.

43:35.363 --> 43:38.742
The guy who was in that accident
in the old city is a friend of mine!

43:38.950 --> 43:41.911
I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth!

43:42.120 --> 43:44.706
I was there when it happened!

43:44.914 --> 43:48.752
Don't they say the only foolish
questions are unasked ones?

43:48.960 --> 43:51.796
Huh? They don't?

43:52.881 --> 43:55.884
That's an intriguing story.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.887
Will you be taking the boy with you?

43:59.095 --> 44:03.642
He knows the subject, and I think
we can use him as a decoy if necessary.

44:03.850 --> 44:07.395
Neo Tokyo is going to change.

44:07.812 --> 44:12.859
In all respects, this city is
saturated. It's like an overripe fruit.

44:13.068 --> 44:15.695
And within it is a new seed.

44:15.904 --> 44:19.866
We only need to wait for
the wind which will make it fall.

44:20.075 --> 44:23.036
The wind called Akira!

44:23.244 --> 44:26.414
Ryu, look!

44:26.915 --> 44:27.791
What is it?

44:27.999 --> 44:30.502
We aren't the ones who will change it,

44:30.710 --> 44:34.714
but rather, those citizens
who hope for Akira will.

44:34.923 --> 44:38.551
That which is called
science perverts providence!

44:38.760 --> 44:41.971
That which is called progress
encourages extravagance!

44:41.971 --> 44:43.807
"The Day of Awakening is Near!"
"Pamphlets 500 yen"

44:43.807 --> 44:46.518
That which is called civilization
devastates the spirit of man!

44:46.726 --> 44:50.563
The time of atonement is upon us!

44:50.772 --> 44:52.774
The time of his awakening is nigh!

44:52.774 --> 45:04.119
"Lord Akira the Enlightened"

45:04.119 --> 45:04.202
Break up this illegal gathering!

45:05.078 --> 45:07.288
Terrorist activities carried out by

45:07.497 --> 45:10.917
anti-government elements
have skyrocketed this month.

45:11.126 --> 45:15.171
The army, riot police, and even
traffic police have been fully mobilized.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.591
The overtime costs alone have
used up the public safety budget.

45:18.800 --> 45:21.010
And then there's the abduction of Number 26!

45:21.219 --> 45:24.222
Isn't their existence supposed
to be highest of state secrets?

45:24.431 --> 45:27.809
No one's ever heard of "Peace
and Order" here in Neo Tokyo, then?

45:28.017 --> 45:31.396
And then there's this request of yours

45:31.604 --> 45:36.443
for further funding because
of subject Number 25's prediction.

45:36.651 --> 45:38.027
You must be joking!

45:38.236 --> 45:43.324
We Parliament members have been
begging the public to bear with us

45:43.533 --> 45:48.621
while we straighten out the former
Prime Minister's historic tax reform blunders,

45:48.830 --> 45:51.750
so where, exactly, are we
supposed to get that kind of money?!

45:51.958 --> 45:56.463
You've spent a fortune, and all we have to
show for it is that grotesque kindergarten!

45:56.671 --> 45:59.090
The Olympics are next year.
The postwar period is over.

45:59.299 --> 46:02.761
How much longer will you keep
spending money on some ghost?!

46:02.969 --> 46:05.972
I always said that we should've put
that money into the welfare program!

46:06.181 --> 46:07.140
Shut up, old man!

46:07.348 --> 46:08.141
What?!

46:08.349 --> 46:12.020
That power is starting to
walk around free as we speak.

46:12.228 --> 46:17.609
- Unless we control it now, we'll lose everything!
- Who do you think you're talking to, youngster?

46:17.817 --> 46:20.653
It was your lack of policy that
started this mess in the first place!

46:20.862 --> 46:25.283
There's still no proof that the
last World War was caused by Akira!

46:25.492 --> 46:29.412
Won't you even try to
understand anything at all

46:29.621 --> 46:31.414
unless an Akira disaster actually happens?!

46:31.623 --> 46:34.000
Has anyone actually seen this "Akira"?

46:34.209 --> 46:36.294
Wasn't Akira Number 25?

46:36.503 --> 46:38.588
No, I think he was Number 21...

46:38.797 --> 46:42.509
The Colonel has lost
sight of his duty as a soldier.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.844
I've had reports that
anti-government elements are using

46:45.053 --> 46:50.725
this "Akira" madness of yours as an
excuse to whip up their terrorist fervor!

46:50.934 --> 46:52.852
No! That's untrue!

46:53.061 --> 46:55.480
Then what about that
Akira world renewal movement?

46:55.688 --> 46:57.565
Wouldn't you say that
information's being leaked?

46:57.774 --> 47:01.069
World renewal movement?
End of the world, more like!

47:01.277 --> 47:04.948
Aren't you just using Akira as
camouflage to cover up your misconduct?

47:05.156 --> 47:06.783
What are you getting at?

47:06.991 --> 47:15.500
Colonel, we can no longer leave the
peace of Neo Tokyo to your sole discretion.

47:15.708 --> 47:16.459
Right!

47:16.668 --> 47:19.879
You are to be put before an inquiry committee.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.339
I agree!

47:25.093 --> 47:26.511
Excuse me!

47:26.928 --> 47:28.847
Colonel! Colonel, where are you--

47:29.055 --> 47:31.516
Wait! This discussion isn't over yet!

47:31.724 --> 47:32.809
Explain yourself!

47:33.017 --> 47:36.062
Are you trying to insult the
supreme executive council?!

47:36.271 --> 47:37.021
Colonel...!

47:37.230 --> 47:38.857
Wait, Colonel!

48:00.712 --> 48:03.047
W-Water...

48:35.330 --> 48:37.415
Hey, wait a minute...

48:37.624 --> 48:41.044
Isn't that cable replacement
scheduled for next week?

48:41.252 --> 48:44.589
The cable they ordered came in early.

48:44.797 --> 48:48.927
Besides, I'm going on vacation
at the end of the week.

48:48.927 --> 48:51.763
"Verify Pass Cards"

48:51.763 --> 48:52.096
I've brought some workers with me, too.

48:52.305 --> 48:57.268
I could take it back, but the
work's gonna be done sooner or later.

49:01.981 --> 49:04.275
Okay, let's go.

50:34.157 --> 50:35.575
What the--?

51:05.104 --> 51:06.397
Milk?

51:14.572 --> 51:16.324
Stay away!

51:29.253 --> 51:29.879
Blood!

51:30.088 --> 51:31.464
I'm scared!

51:40.223 --> 51:42.016
Jerk!

51:42.225 --> 51:44.352
W-Who the hell are they?

52:39.907 --> 52:43.536
Room 887, Tetsuo Shima...

52:43.744 --> 52:45.663
A problem with the automatic lock?

52:50.918 --> 52:54.338
Hey! You can't just walk off from your room!

52:58.968 --> 53:00.344
Come on, let's go back.

53:00.553 --> 53:03.681
What the hell happened? What a mess!

53:26.454 --> 53:30.333
There are 58 blocks with circuits
that the computer won't display.

53:30.541 --> 53:34.879
Of those, nearly 40 are concentrated
on underground levels 7 and 8.

53:35.087 --> 53:36.464
That's probably the place.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.010
The central wiring shaft should be up ahead.

53:41.219 --> 53:43.846
We should be able to use it
to go straight to the sublevels.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.351
Be careful. It's deeper in the middle.

53:48.559 --> 53:49.936
What a stink!

53:50.144 --> 53:50.811
Quiet!

53:51.020 --> 53:54.023
What? I said it stinks because it stinks!

53:54.232 --> 53:56.943
- Is your nose busted?
- Hurry up and stay quiet!

53:58.527 --> 54:00.988
Damn! Hide!

54:01.197 --> 54:02.406
Huh? Where?

54:02.615 --> 54:04.784
What're you doing, you idiot?!

54:18.589 --> 54:20.049
They left?

54:20.258 --> 54:21.717
Looks like they've beefed up security.

54:21.926 --> 54:23.469
Must be that siren we heard.

54:23.678 --> 54:24.929
What should we do? Scout around some?

54:25.137 --> 54:26.430
No.

54:26.639 --> 54:27.682
- Are you okay?
- Let's keep going.

54:27.890 --> 54:30.184
I want to check out their
security at the very least.

54:30.393 --> 54:31.352
All right.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.230
We've been spotted! Run!

54:34.438 --> 54:35.523
Shit!

54:35.731 --> 54:38.651
Don't! Don't shoot!

54:41.237 --> 54:44.949
Shimazaki! Shit!

54:45.157 --> 54:46.993
Forget about him! Run!

54:50.705 --> 54:52.790
What the hell is that?

54:53.791 --> 54:55.126
Here it comes!

54:55.960 --> 54:58.170
Forget it! You can't do any good!

55:02.967 --> 55:04.802
Die!

55:05.720 --> 55:07.179
This is Unit 304, Shaft H!

55:07.388 --> 55:11.225
I have encountered intruders
and am engaging! Request backup!

55:11.767 --> 55:13.102
Here it comes!

55:39.253 --> 55:40.504
Kei!

55:43.174 --> 55:44.508
Where's that gun?!

55:45.009 --> 55:47.053
Damn it...!

55:49.305 --> 55:50.765
Kaneda!

56:00.733 --> 56:02.568
Kei, this way!

56:03.486 --> 56:06.530
Hurry!

56:06.739 --> 56:09.200
Kaneda, hurry!

56:24.215 --> 56:25.966
Kaneda!

56:38.687 --> 56:40.689
The brakes! Where are the brakes?!

56:40.898 --> 56:41.941
That's not it?

56:42.149 --> 56:43.943
This is the central wiring shaft!

56:44.151 --> 56:45.861
It's gotta be this one, then!

56:51.992 --> 56:54.787
Okay, I'm getting the hang of this!

56:54.995 --> 56:57.081
Ask the Colonel for clearance to fire!

56:57.289 --> 56:59.208
Turn that up!

56:59.417 --> 57:00.709
There must be some mistake.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.421
That boy looks like the
patient they admitted to the lab.

57:03.629 --> 57:06.799
The boy, the subject named
Tetsuo Shima, broke out of his room.

57:07.007 --> 57:08.843
I think he's headed for the Baby Room.

57:09.051 --> 57:10.010
Tetsuo?!

57:10.219 --> 57:12.930
He is in an extremely dangerous
state! Don't let him through!

57:13.139 --> 57:15.933
I repeat, do not let him through!

57:43.961 --> 57:45.129
What the--?

57:52.720 --> 57:54.346
It's no use hiding.

57:54.555 --> 57:56.515
We have no choice, then. Use your guns!

57:56.724 --> 58:00.060
We can't let him go any
farther, no matter what it takes!

58:01.061 --> 58:02.730
Fire!

58:42.061 --> 58:44.688
So, here you are...

58:49.902 --> 58:51.403
Stop it!

58:53.405 --> 58:56.325
How long are you
gonna keep playing around?!

59:03.123 --> 59:05.292
Where'd the other one go?

59:06.585 --> 59:08.128
Why, you...

59:09.338 --> 59:10.839
Die!

59:13.217 --> 59:14.802
Takashi!

59:24.895 --> 59:30.025
What the hell is going on?
Am I dreaming or something?

59:30.234 --> 59:33.737
I never knew I had powers like this!

59:40.661 --> 59:43.038
Damn it, which way should I go?!

59:43.247 --> 59:46.667
Straight. Straight ahead...

59:46.875 --> 59:47.751
Huh?

59:47.960 --> 59:50.713
There's a freight elevator.

59:52.006 --> 59:55.009
We can take it to sublevel 8.

01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:05.853
Good, you're all together.

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:10.232
You thought you could kill me?

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:15.487
You tried to mess with me...
I'm gonna kill you!

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:23.037
That was you--

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:24.496
Takashi!

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.540
Attack him together!

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:28.834
O-Okay.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.007
You little twerps!

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.359
That's enough! All of you!

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.619
Who the hell are you?!

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:10.209
What's the matter?
Does your head hurt, Tetsuo Shima?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:12.211
Your power isn't fully matured.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.546
If you push yourself,
you might do irreparable damage.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.715
Just do as we tell you.

01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:21.970
What the hell did you people do to my head?!

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.147
Calm yourself, Tetsuo Shima!

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.483
He can't control it.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:40.364
What?!

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:46.120
She said that big people like you
should never use the power like that.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:48.706
She says something horrible will happen.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.999
Mind your own business.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.964
What? More powerful than me?

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:04.179
He's the one! He's been popping
in and out of my head lately!

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.141
Where is he?! Where's this "Akira"?!

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.683
What?!

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:12.020
Kiyoko said that you'll awaken Akira.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.982
If that happens, no one
will be able to stop him.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.734
So before that can happen,
we have to stop you.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.694
Impossible! Akira's already--

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.989
Where is he?!

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.158
Stop it!

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.951
Shut up!

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:35.043
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:39.214
Enacting disaster protocols.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.801
Threat level to facility
integrity has passed level 7.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.096
Enacting disaster protocols.

01:02:46.305 --> 01:02:47.765
What the--?!

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:56.607
Hands up!

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:01.820
Where the hell is the "Baby Room"?!

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.667
Oh, no! Run!

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:22.716
Gangway, coming through! Coming through!

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.593
Damn it, move!

01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:28.055
Kiyoko...

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.451
Damn, that hurt...

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.580
Kaneda? What're you doing here?

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.586
Tetsuo! Are you okay?
I'm here to rescue you!

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:05.801
Hurry up, you moron! If we don't get
out of here, those guys outside are gonna--

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:09.930
There he is! Catch him!

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.393
Stay away from me!

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.606
Kaneda!

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:26.071
Oh, right. I forgot you were there, Kaneda.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.282
That's okay, Kaneda.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.870
I won't be needing you to save me anymore.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:35.789
From now on, I'll be saving you.

01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:39.084
All you have to do is ask, Kanny.

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:44.339
Say what? Who the hell do
you think you're talking to?!

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.718
You don't like the way I talk?

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.303
Does it make you mad?

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.013
Well, what're you gonna do about it?!

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:55.434
Huh, Kaneda?! What're
you gonna do about it?!

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:09.865
That's enough! Don't hurt anyone else!

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.785
Where's this "Akira" guy?!

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:15.996
He...

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:19.333
The Olympic stadium...?
In an underground facility?

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:23.128
No! You're wrong! Akira is--

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:26.590
Wait!

01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:40.562
What the hell? I can do this, too?!

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.320
Kiyoko, are you okay?

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.238
It doesn't look like she's hurt.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.033
What about you, Masaru? You're bleeding.

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:55.202
What happened to him?

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.495
He flew away.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:59.331
How can he have so much power...?

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.212
How could this have
happened? Is anyone here?

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.007
He's developed so much
power in such a short time...

01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:11.259
Find him! Find Tetsuo!

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.721
- Find him! Go after him!
- Kaneda! Hang on, Kaneda!

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:17.891
Hurry up! Get that rubble cleared!

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.520
He went to where Akira is.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:25.524
What? You're all safe!

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:29.319
He's heading for the facility
below the Olympic construction site.

01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:31.530
How did Tetsuo find out about that?!

01:06:35.409 --> 01:06:39.079
You mean he's gone outside?

01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:44.793
Damn it! We'll follow him! Prepare for pursuit!

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:46.211
- Yes, sir!
- He's heading west!

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.964
He's heading for the
Olympic construction site!

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.800
Tell them to beef up their security!

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.011
- You...!
- Set up checkpoints on all...

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:04.479
According to the defense team, intruders
were encountered in the wiring shaft.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.565
Two disguised as workers resisted
and were shot, and the rest are at large.

01:07:06.565 --> 01:07:10.777
- He has to be stopped before his powers mature...
- Two disguised as workers resisted and were shot, and the rest are at large.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.531
Your objective is the boy Tetsuo Shima.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.993
If we are unable to capture him, you will
lure him out to the old city and attack.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.454
Request assistance from
the Eastern District Battalion.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:20.954
Yes, sir!

01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:23.373
Tell them there isn't a moment to lose!

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.003
I've been waiting for you, Colonel.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.756
Who the hell are you?!

01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:36.595
I'm here to inform you of the
supreme executive council's decision.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:42.517
At 2400 hours today, the Colonel is
hereby stripped of his command and rank,

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.936
and will be placed under arrest.

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:46.563
What?!

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:49.649
Please come with us.

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:54.154
You expect me to hand Neo Tokyo
over to those fools at a time like this?

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.200
- Shoot him.
- Yes, sir!

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.202
What?

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.120
W-Wait!

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:07.125
Enough! Open your eyes
and look at the big picture!

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:10.629
We can't dance to the tune of
corrupt politicians and capitalists!

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:18.345
Don't you understand?!
It's pointless to fight anymore!

01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:26.685
Announce a state of emergency,
arrest all members of the executive council

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:29.481
and remove them from
the chain of command!

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.358
We're going after Tetsuo!

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:35.569
Urgent message to all
district battalion commanders!

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.037
"Haruki-ya"

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:49.251
Hey, what's up? You by yourself?

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:53.546
Weren't you in an accident or something?

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:57.091
Everybody's been worried.
So, you feeling better?

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.845
Gimme some... capsules.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:04.599
Hey, are you sure about that?
You don't look so hot.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:07.810
Just hand 'em over!

01:09:08.019 --> 01:09:09.895
All right, if you say so.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:14.234
But with all those demonstrations and
terrorist attacks lately, things are rough.

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:18.613
They're hard to come by,
so they're pretty expensive.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:29.374
Tetsuo's run off, Kaneda's disappeared...
I guess the team's finished.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:35.130
And the checkpoints are so strict,
even the Clowns are staying put.

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.807
What's wrong?

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:47.559
"This End Up"

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.228
He's dead!

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:51.813
What?!

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.483
What the--?

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:01.865
Tetsuo?

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:06.703
What are you doing here?

01:10:06.912 --> 01:10:09.539
You want some, too?

01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:13.168
What are you talking about, damn it?!
What the hell happened here?!

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.754
The barkeep's dead!

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.801
A fish out of water dies, huh?

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:27.933
You are Tetsuo... Aren't you?

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:30.185
Kaneda sends his regards.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.686
You saw Kaneda?!

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.981
He's probably dead by now...

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:41.029
You did this, Tetsuo?

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:45.575
So anyway... Where's Kaneda's bike?

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:46.952
Tetsuo!

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:50.080
I don't need a piece of
junk like that anymore...

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:51.706
You son of a...

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.880
Yamagata!

01:11:05.387 --> 01:11:07.305
Shit...

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:15.939
He went to where Akira is?

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:18.149
That's what that girl said.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:22.570
The army, you, and Ryu are
all looking for this "Akira" guy,

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:24.864
so that's why you're chasing after Tetsuo.

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:29.160
It has something to do with
that power of Tetsuo's, right?

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.913
What the hell is this "Akira"
thing you keep talking about?

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:39.379
Ryu told me about it once.
He said that Akira is absolute energy.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.423
Absolute energy?

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.427
Humans do all kinds of
things during their lifetime, right?

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:49.889
Discovering things, building things...

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:57.605
Things like houses, motorcycles,
bridges, cities, and rockets...

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:01.776
All that knowledge and energy...
Where do you suppose it comes from?

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.781
Humans were like monkeys once, right?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.493
And before that, like reptiles and fish.

01:12:10.702 --> 01:12:14.622
And before that, plankton and amoebas.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:19.044
Even creatures like those have
incredible energy inside them.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.505
Because of genes, I guess.

01:12:22.714 --> 01:12:27.635
And even before that, maybe
there were genes in the water and air.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:30.221
Even in space dust, too, I bet.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:34.684
If that's true, what
memories are hidden in it?

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:38.521
The beginning of the universe, maybe.
Or maybe even before that.

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:42.525
Hey, what's the matter? Are you okay?

01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:45.070
Did you get hit on the head back there?

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.865
Maybe everyone has those memories.

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:51.826
What if there were some mistake
and the progression went wrong,

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:56.664
and something like an amoeba
were given power like a human's?

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.752
That's what Akira is?

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.047
Amoebas don't build houses and bridges.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:06.841
They just devour all the food around them.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:11.596
That's what Tetsuo's doing?
You're saying he has that kind of energy?!

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:16.267
A long time ago, there were people
who tried to control that power.

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:18.686
At the government's request, you see.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:24.192
They failed, and it triggered the Fall of Tokyo.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:28.738
That power is still too much for--

01:13:30.657 --> 01:13:32.200
What?!

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:34.035
The door's unlocked.

01:13:37.539 --> 01:13:38.790
Huh?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.631
This has got to be a trap.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.715
Go back, then.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:52.011
No, we ought to find out
how much of it is a trap...

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:58.893
By the way, what's
with you and that Ryu guy?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.020
- What do you mean?
- You're always together.

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:03.857
That's none of your business!

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:08.778
What I'm saying is, he doesn't
know about us, does he?

01:14:08.987 --> 01:14:09.696
"Us"?

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:13.158
Hey, wait a minute!
What's that supposed to mean?

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:14.617
Do you think this will work?

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:21.166
It can't be helped. At this point,
our only option is to use her.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:28.089
The fact that she turned up right
under our noses says as much, I think.

01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:29.799
I guess...

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:47.525
Have arrived at Ward 13,
East Ginza intersection. Over.

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:50.945
Northern District battalion has not
responded to mobilization request.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.781
Special search team to HQ!
Special search team to HQ!

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:57.911
We're at the Haruki-ya snack bar
near the highway interchange in Ward 8.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:03.958
It doesn't look like a bomb
explosion, so we think it was him.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:07.837
It was almost certainly the work of
the subject that escaped from the lab.

01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:10.965
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Understood!

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:18.973
Kaneda!

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:22.060
What?! Yamagata's dead?!

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:24.979
Something seemed strange
about him from the second I saw him.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.899
He was wearing what looked
like a white hospital gown.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.902
It was like he was a different person.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:35.990
Yamagata asked him
if he was really Tetsuo.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:40.578
And then... Yamagata, he...

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.959
We've always been together.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:52.382
I've known everything about him
since we were in the children's home.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:57.345
He was a klutz, and
everybody made him cry.

01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:01.849
Oh, right... He wanted to
know where your bike was.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.810
My bike...?

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.654
What're you gonna do?

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:16.823
I'm gonna send Yamagata his bike.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:25.081
You dumb bastard!

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.960
Kaneda!

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.686
Kei!

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:48.313
What's wrong?

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:55.528
You! You were there that night...

01:16:58.573 --> 01:17:00.158
Wait!

01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:07.624
Kei!

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:12.587
They disappeared!

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:17.508
You were the ones who
changed Tetsuo too, weren't you?

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:22.597
Akira's power exists within everyone.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.015
Who's there?!

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:31.397
But when that power is awakened,
even if you weren't prepared for it,

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:37.320
you must choose how to use it.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:40.615
And he has made his choice.

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:47.080
Tetsuo is our newest companion.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:51.292
We're partly to blame for his actions.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:54.545
Why did you take Kei, then?!

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:57.298
We want her to help us.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:18:00.635
You can't just use people
like that! Bring Kei back!

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:05.390
Tetsuo's our friend! If anyone's
gonna kill him, it should be us!

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:09.936
Hey!

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.479
Damn it!

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:15.775
Mr. Omi and the other executives
have been arrested by the coup...?

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.026
Y-Yes, that's right.

01:18:17.235 --> 01:18:19.654
The house guards are
fighting them right now.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.030
Yes.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:23.741
I'd like to have a helicopter
waiting at West Haneda.

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:25.368
Yes.

01:18:25.785 --> 01:18:29.455
That damned Colonel...
I can't believe he's taken up arms.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.043
I underestimated him.

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:40.675
Hold them here! Damn!

01:19:10.997 --> 01:19:12.582
Mr. Nezu...

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:16.127
R-Ryu?! ls that you?

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.045
I'm sorry, sir...

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.590
The mission was a failure.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.383
What are you doing here?!

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:24.969
I've told you, you can't be seen here!

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:27.972
All of my men...

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:29.891
They've all been killed.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:33.519
Y-You sold me out,
didn't you, you bastard?!

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:35.313
What? You can't be--

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:40.568
Kei...

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:48.743
I got fresh fish in here, buddy!
I'm gonna get compensated for 'em, right?

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.288
Please, I have to catch a flight at noon!

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.540
What?

01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:56.626
7th Avenue is just ahead!

01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:58.878
It intersects this road 100 meters from here!

01:20:03.341 --> 01:20:05.051
Prepare for battle!

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:17.063
Right, we've spotted the subject.

01:20:17.271 --> 01:20:19.524
What? Attack?!

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:23.694
But he's just a... We're attacking a boy?!

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.574
Look! There he is!

01:20:28.783 --> 01:20:29.367
Impossible!

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.118
Is this for real?

01:20:39.085 --> 01:20:42.463
"Samurai Spirit"

01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:44.966
Firing preparations complete.

01:20:47.385 --> 01:20:49.512
Damn it! Fire!

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.527
- Akira!
- It's Lord Akira!

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:07.488
It's the advent of Lord Akira!

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:09.282
That's not him! Don't be fooled!

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.366
That's not Lord Akira!

01:21:10.575 --> 01:21:12.034
Shut up!

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:15.997
Long live Lord Akira!

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.915
Fire!

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:19.417
Huh?

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.043
What's wrong?

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:52.760
"Akira"

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.136
in spite of martial law in the
name of freedom of the press!

01:22:54.345 --> 01:22:57.974
What in the world is
happening here in Neo Tokyo?

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.935
What you see here seems to
be fires caused by tank cannons.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.980
But who is this young boy?

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:07.274
Is he fighting the coup forces all by himself?

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:13.781
Viewers, the army has just
illegally ordered us to land!

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.117
Freedom of the press is now in jeopardy!

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:18.577
What happened? Were they cut off?

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.705
The bridge! He's heading for the bridge!

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:23.874
Let's go see!

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:42.727
Are you really going alone?

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:46.188
He wants this, doesn't he?

01:23:46.397 --> 01:23:49.358
We should call the gang together.

01:23:49.567 --> 01:23:50.776
Hey!

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:53.404
I wouldn't want to keep him waiting.

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.950
Hey, Kaneda! Wait!

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:06.709
Half seem to be
anti-government demonstrators.

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:11.255
The rest are... Well, they're more
like some crazy cult than onlookers.

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:14.592
They're following after the subject,
and more and more keep coming.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:28.147
"We Worship the Great Lord Akira"

01:24:28.147 --> 01:24:30.191
Consume our unclean hearts!

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.693
Fear not!

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:38.199
Your bodies will be purified in the flames!

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.618
Ready!

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.205
Fire!

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:53.214
Set the switch to hold for three
seconds and converge your beams!

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:54.381
Aim!

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:56.050
Fire!

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.766
Watch this!

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.607
Look out! Let's get out of here!

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:24.120
Help me!

01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:33.212
Ground forces! Ground forces, come in!

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.339
Report! What is the subject's status?!

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:36.924
Ground forces!

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:40.469
Call the Doctor.

01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:43.556
We have confirmation of his
recent movements and are in pursuit.

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:46.100
His present position is... Let's see...

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:51.397
Coordinates 99871 by 4332.

01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:55.192
That's about 2 km south of the
Olympics construction site in the old city.

01:25:55.401 --> 01:25:56.777
What?!

01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:03.868
What was that?

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:05.870
Look!

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:09.623
That's near the toll booth that's
being guarded by the 2nd platoon.

01:26:09.832 --> 01:26:12.209
Wha--?

01:26:12.418 --> 01:26:13.419
Huh?

01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:19.925
Please turn around!
This area's off limits to civilians!

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:22.553
What? That's the subject?!

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.138
S-Stop!

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:26.098
Stop, damn it!

01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:34.041
Nice place you have here.

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:44.009
Wait, you were with Kaneda.

01:27:44.218 --> 01:27:48.681
You shouldn't use your power this way.

01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:49.807
What?

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:54.645
In the end, you won't be able to control it.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.146
The kids...

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:58.148
You're those brats, aren't you?!

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:18.043
Okay, then...!

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:41.066
What the--?

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.121
It's not safe here, Colonel!

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:37.831
Well, what're you gonna do?

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:06.128
Open up!

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.682
What the hell?

01:31:18.891 --> 01:31:21.685
That's Akira, Tetsuo!

01:31:21.894 --> 01:31:25.022
That's the "Akira" you wanted to meet.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.858
There's your Messiah!

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:30.402
After his transcendental awakening,

01:31:30.611 --> 01:31:35.240
his body was subjected to
every test known to science.

01:31:35.449 --> 01:31:39.453
And that's what was left of it.

01:31:46.919 --> 01:31:48.420
"Cranial Nerve"

01:31:48.504 --> 01:31:52.591
The scientists back then
were unable to solve the mystery,

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:56.887
so they decided to entrust their
collected data and test samples

01:31:57.095 --> 01:32:02.434
to future generations by
preserving them in a frozen capsule.

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:04.061
SOL... We'll use SOL!

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:05.729
Sir?

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:10.275
Akira is already dead!

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:13.737
Well? Are you satisfied now, Tetsuo?

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:20.869
So come back with us!

01:32:21.078 --> 01:32:22.538
Like hell!

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.290
Contact the central defense center

01:32:25.499 --> 01:32:29.044
and tell them to patch us
through to SOL's control circuits!

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:30.671
Yes, sir!

01:32:46.228 --> 01:32:48.063
Hey, watch it!

01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:52.401
Damn it, move! Get out of the way!

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:11.461
What is this, science class?

01:33:28.395 --> 01:33:31.398
What's wrong? Have some trouble?

01:33:31.607 --> 01:33:35.193
Yeah, but I already took care of it.

01:33:35.402 --> 01:33:37.321
If you were here earlier,
you could've watched the show.

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:40.198
You had me worried again.

01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:43.493
I figured you'd be standing here,
sobbing like a little baby.

01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:48.206
Kaneda, you've always
been a pain in the ass.

01:33:48.415 --> 01:33:53.003
You've been telling me what
to do ever since we were kids.

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:55.172
You always treat me like a kid.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.050
You always show up and
start bossing me around!

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.177
And now you're a boss, too...

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:02.220
Of this pile of rubble.

01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:03.555
Kaneda!

01:34:03.764 --> 01:34:06.224
That's Mister Kaneda to you, punk!

01:34:06.433 --> 01:34:08.977
Die!

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:19.571
Tetsuo!

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.347
Son of a...

01:34:58.568 --> 01:34:59.861
Kei!

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:02.989
Oh, hell!

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:09.246
Let's do it!

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.466
Got him!

01:35:22.676 --> 01:35:24.261
Huh?

01:35:28.724 --> 01:35:30.100
The battery?!

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:32.185
What's the matter, Kaneda?

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.981
God damn it! This ain't fair, Tetsuo!

01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:37.983
Fight with your bare hands!

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:42.738
Oh, this is funny...

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.616
Feeling frustrated, Kaneda?

01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:50.162
Now do you understand how it feels?

01:35:56.293 --> 01:35:58.253
What's this light?

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.098
Well, did you hit him?

01:36:10.307 --> 01:36:13.101
We're too close to the impact point.
There's too much electrical interference.

01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:14.936
Prepare a second volley!

01:36:37.793 --> 01:36:42.464
Hey! Kaneda!

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:03.819
Tetsuo!

01:37:18.834 --> 01:37:20.418
Shit...

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:21.920
Huh?

01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:23.296
What the--?

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.667
Correcting for tracking system error.

01:38:00.876 --> 01:38:02.711
T-minus-20 to energy alteration.

01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:04.212
- Fire extinguishers!
- Are you okay?

01:38:04.421 --> 01:38:05.005
Hurry! Hurry!

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:07.883
What happened? What's going on?

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.602
Kaneda!

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.187
Kai! Kei!

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:22.731
- Kaneda!
- Kaneda!

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:23.648
Get on!

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:24.900
Get on? Where?

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:26.651
Hurry! Hurry!

01:38:48.924 --> 01:38:50.425
What's that?

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:06.733
They say it's SOL.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.287
Magnificent...

01:39:28.797 --> 01:39:32.801
When Tetsuo's power reaches its peak?

01:39:33.009 --> 01:39:34.678
That's when we do it.

01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:37.639
But will it work?

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:43.269
The future doesn't
proceed along a single course.

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:47.232
There ought to be a future we can choose.

01:39:56.992 --> 01:39:58.535
What's Tetsuo's status?

01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:00.537
Ah, Colonel...

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:04.040
We set up a camera in the stadium a while ago.

01:40:04.249 --> 01:40:05.875
We have him under observation.

01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:11.423
Colonel, you must take a look at this data!

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:14.592
We're still analyzing the energy
given off by the subject, but...

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:17.637
It's magnificent. Absolutely magnificent.

01:40:17.846 --> 01:40:20.515
This is clearly a proton collapse.

01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:24.686
We're also detecting a fair number of
what we believe to be unknown particles.

01:40:24.894 --> 01:40:27.731
If we can put this into a
theoretical framework, physics--

01:40:27.939 --> 01:40:29.190
No, science...

01:40:29.399 --> 01:40:32.527
Humanity itself could touch the
fundamental truths of the universe!

01:40:34.821 --> 01:40:36.489
Oh. That's...

01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:39.200
We still haven't finished
making our adjustments.

01:40:39.409 --> 01:40:41.578
Uh, Colonel!

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:48.376
T-That's...!

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:53.673
You bastard! What did I tell you?!

01:40:53.882 --> 01:40:55.508
B-But, Colonel!

01:40:55.717 --> 01:40:59.179
I couldn't throw away
such a magnificent subject!

01:40:59.763 --> 01:41:02.057
Shut up!

01:41:24.496 --> 01:41:26.081
Shit! It's on fire!

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:27.373
The battery! The battery!

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:30.502
My bike! It's burning up!

01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:33.046
Hey, what's a bike or two?

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:37.217
What? Then there's nothing
wrong with using yours, right?

01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:38.426
You heard that?

01:41:38.635 --> 01:41:39.677
Yeah, I did!

01:41:39.886 --> 01:41:41.805
Hey, your bike's still on fire.

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:25.265
Tetsuo?

01:42:36.568 --> 01:42:40.822
Tetsuo, why does
everyone call you "Akira"?

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:45.368
He never existed in the first place.

01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:48.288
They didn't care who it was.

01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:53.042
Just so long as he destroyed things.

01:42:53.251 --> 01:42:55.545
Your arm!

01:42:55.753 --> 01:42:59.424
It doesn't look like much,
but it works pretty good.

01:43:02.552 --> 01:43:04.721
What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:43:07.390 --> 01:43:08.933
It's nothing!

01:43:09.142 --> 01:43:09.851
Tetsuo...

01:43:10.059 --> 01:43:11.853
Shut up! Just go away!

01:43:19.569 --> 01:43:21.738
Medicine...

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:25.116
What's wrong, Tetsuo? Are you in pain?

01:43:25.325 --> 01:43:28.870
Go back to the lab and
get me some of that medicine!

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:30.705
Did you hear that, Doctor?

01:43:30.914 --> 01:43:32.123
Yes, Colonel.

01:43:32.332 --> 01:43:34.500
Well? Can you see any signs of it?

01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:37.086
I'm not entirely certain,

01:43:37.295 --> 01:43:41.466
but it seems that the power that had
been held back by the drugs is breaking free.

01:43:41.674 --> 01:43:45.094
He may not be able to control the
power that has awakened so suddenly.

01:43:45.303 --> 01:43:47.805
At any rate, he's in an
extremely dangerous condition!

01:43:48.765 --> 01:43:53.394
If you don't go back to the lab and
receive proper treatment, you may die.

01:43:56.231 --> 01:43:59.943
You want me to enroll in that
kindergarten and live happily ever after?

01:44:00.151 --> 01:44:06.032
Take my medicine every day
and shrivel up like those kids?!

01:44:10.995 --> 01:44:14.666
Kaori... Kaori...

01:44:15.083 --> 01:44:18.962
Please... I need that medicine...

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:20.838
No...!

01:44:21.047 --> 01:44:22.131
Tetsuo!

01:44:23.716 --> 01:44:25.385
Tetsuo!

01:44:27.095 --> 01:44:28.346
Tetsuo--

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.171
Kaneda?!

01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:41.252
Huh?

01:45:48.551 --> 01:45:50.720
Son of a...

01:45:54.182 --> 01:45:56.517
You kids... What are you doing here?

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.609
You never learn, do you?

01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:08.696
Tetsuo!

01:46:22.627 --> 01:46:24.462
Takashi...

01:46:26.756 --> 01:46:28.633
Akira...

01:46:28.633 --> 01:46:30.760
"Optic Nerve"

01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:45.858
Kaneda...? H-Help me...!

01:46:54.784 --> 01:46:56.327
Kaori...

01:46:59.789 --> 01:47:02.500
Help me...!

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:15.638
Help me!

01:47:15.847 --> 01:47:17.932
Stop it!

01:47:34.866 --> 01:47:35.658
Kaori?

01:47:35.867 --> 01:47:38.703
Kaori! Kaori!

01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:41.497
Tetsuo? Is that you, Tetsuo?!

01:47:41.706 --> 01:47:44.667
Kaori! Kaori's gonna die!

01:47:44.876 --> 01:47:47.462
What?! What did you say?!

01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:50.131
My body's not doing what I tell it to!

01:47:50.339 --> 01:47:52.758
My power's acting on its own...!

01:47:52.967 --> 01:47:55.219
Kaori!

01:47:55.428 --> 01:47:57.430
Kaori's dying!

01:47:57.638 --> 01:47:59.765
Kaneda, help me!

01:47:59.974 --> 01:48:01.851
Stop, Tetsuo!

01:48:02.059 --> 01:48:04.020
Stop it!

01:48:04.228 --> 01:48:08.024
Kaori's pain is coming into me...!

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:12.028
Tetsuo!

01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:16.574
Kaneda! Run away!

01:48:29.086 --> 01:48:31.589
Tetsuo!

01:48:43.059 --> 01:48:46.854
Kiyoko! Takashi! Masaru! Get away from here!

01:48:51.234 --> 01:48:52.360
Come on!

01:48:58.908 --> 01:49:01.827
I can't believe it. It's as if--

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:17.510
Kiyoko! Taka--

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:55.548
Hi, Akira.

01:50:04.307 --> 01:50:07.226
Th-This is...

01:50:07.435 --> 01:50:09.937
But that's-- Oh, no!

01:50:19.071 --> 01:50:21.532
W-Where am I?

01:50:21.741 --> 01:50:23.868
Hurry! Get into the tunnel!

01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:25.286
You'll be safe in there.

01:50:25.494 --> 01:50:27.496
Kiyoko! Where are you?

01:50:42.094 --> 01:50:43.888
Tetsuo!

01:50:44.096 --> 01:50:46.515
Kaneda!

01:50:46.724 --> 01:50:48.100
Hang on!

01:50:50.144 --> 01:50:52.563
- If you don't get out of here now, you'll--
- Out of the way!

01:50:52.772 --> 01:50:54.106
Tetsuo!

01:50:54.315 --> 01:50:56.359
Don't go!

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:05.201
No, Takashi!

01:51:05.409 --> 01:51:08.746
If you went in now, you'd be trapped, too.

01:51:08.954 --> 01:51:13.376
But none of this is his fault!

01:51:19.799 --> 01:51:22.843
- Takashi!
- Takashi!

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:36.107
If we went in, we wouldn't be
strong enough to come back out.

01:51:36.315 --> 01:51:40.403
But if the three of us worked together,
maybe we could at least save that boy.

01:51:40.611 --> 01:51:42.113
You're right.

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:44.240
Together, the three of us could...

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.959
Oh, man...!

01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:58.504
We should get out of here. Hey!

01:51:58.713 --> 01:52:00.381
Kaneda...

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.459
Look, you're not revving your engine enough.

01:52:36.667 --> 01:52:40.212
When you go into a corner, lean like
you're trying to kill yourself. Watch!

01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:41.881
What're you doing?

01:52:42.089 --> 01:52:44.133
Cornering, man.

01:52:45.593 --> 01:52:47.595
Got it, Tetsuo...?

01:52:53.642 --> 01:52:55.352
Look, there's another one!

01:52:55.561 --> 01:52:57.688
- Another transfer student?
- He was abandoned.

01:52:57.897 --> 01:52:59.940
You can see it in his face.

01:53:03.652 --> 01:53:08.949
Are... Are these your dreams, Tetsuo?

01:53:10.201 --> 01:53:11.410
Wait!

01:54:28.737 --> 01:54:31.740
This is Akira...?

01:54:31.949 --> 01:54:35.119
Yes. We called him.

01:54:35.327 --> 01:54:37.413
To have him take Tetsuo away.

01:54:37.621 --> 01:54:40.833
Take him away? Take him where?

01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:43.210
It's too much for Tetsuo.

01:54:43.419 --> 01:54:46.839
And for us. And for Akira.

01:54:47.047 --> 01:54:50.593
It's too big for us as we are now.

01:54:50.801 --> 01:54:54.597
But someday, we'll also be able to...

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:57.850
You see, it's already begun.

01:54:58.058 --> 01:55:00.269
Your friend's--

01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:02.980
My friend?

01:55:03.188 --> 01:55:06.275
Kei! You mean Kei, don't you?

01:55:31.759 --> 01:55:33.302
Tetsuo...

01:55:38.057 --> 01:55:39.934
This is yours, right?

01:55:45.731 --> 01:55:49.902
They're always like that with the
new kids. You came today, right?

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:51.612
They beat me up, too.

01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:54.907
But the truth is, those guys are wimps.

01:55:55.115 --> 01:56:00.871
I'm Tetsuo. Tetsuo Shima.

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.041
To tell you the truth, I just got here myself.

01:56:04.249 --> 01:56:06.043
I'm--

01:56:06.251 --> 01:56:07.753
Kaneda...

01:56:09.004 --> 01:56:11.048
Kaneda?

01:56:11.256 --> 01:56:11.840
Kaneda!

01:56:12.049 --> 01:56:13.342
Kei?

01:56:39.076 --> 01:56:42.705
W-What's happening?
What in the world is happening?

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.334
B-But this isn't...

01:56:47.543 --> 01:56:52.381
If this is correct, it's almost as if...
ls this the birth of a universe?!

01:56:58.137 --> 01:57:01.306
Kei!

01:57:06.895 --> 01:57:08.480
What happened?

01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:13.277
It's disappearing...! It's disappearing!

01:58:24.348 --> 01:58:27.351
Kaneda!

01:58:50.082 --> 01:58:51.667
Tetsuo...

01:58:54.336 --> 01:58:56.171
Kaneda...

01:58:57.381 --> 01:58:58.549
Thanks.

01:59:00.217 --> 01:59:03.554
You called to me, right? I heard you.

01:59:10.352 --> 01:59:13.272
Kaneda, don't tell me you're...

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.691
What about Tetsuo?

01:59:15.899 --> 01:59:18.485
He left.

01:59:18.694 --> 01:59:20.654
So did those three kids.

01:59:20.863 --> 01:59:21.947
Akira, too.

01:59:22.156 --> 01:59:24.575
Kaneda, back then, you...

01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:31.373
Kaneda! You're alive?!

01:59:31.582 --> 01:59:38.297
I thought you were in there for sure!

01:59:38.505 --> 01:59:39.381
Tetsuo...

01:59:39.590 --> 01:59:41.550
What happened to Tetsuo?

01:59:41.758 --> 01:59:43.010
Is he dead?!

01:59:43.218 --> 01:59:46.555
I'm not so sure. But he's probably...

02:00:12.372 --> 02:00:16.043
But someday, we'll also be able to...

02:00:16.251 --> 02:00:18.754
You see, it's already begun.

02:00:37.564 --> 02:00:42.194
I am... Tetsuo.
