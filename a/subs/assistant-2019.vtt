Goldman hasn’t sent the revised deck.

38:43.135 --> 38:45.971
They said he wants to add four more films.
And talk about the library

38:46.554 --> 38:49.599
I haven’t had a chance
to revise the report.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.353
But he can add ten more films,
the problem is...

38:53.603 --> 38:56.023
the domestic marketing. And of course,
the overhead fee.

38:56.314 --> 39:01.278
The talent pool. He still insists on a
gross fee for the executive producer fees.

39:01.403 --> 39:02.905
But we will be executive producers, no?

39:03.071 --> 39:05.824
But not included in the pool,
according to…

39:12.372 --> 39:13.916
And what happened
to the release requirement?

39:13.999 --> 39:15.333
Still holding at 100 screens.

39:15.625 --> 39:18.503
- We told them we need a thousand.
- I know.
