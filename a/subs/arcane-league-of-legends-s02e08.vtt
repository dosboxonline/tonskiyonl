01:30.375 --> 01:32.625
I'm one of you?

01:33.500 --> 01:34.624
A mage?

01:34.625 --> 01:37.332
[sorceress] We each have
our own expressions.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.249
Yours is quite rare.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.582
An empath.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.415
Attuned to the ethereal.

01:42.416 --> 01:46.582
Able to sense others' inner selves
and bend their magic.

01:46.583 --> 01:48.750
A conduit and a mirror.

01:49.416 --> 01:50.915
What does that make you?

01:50.916 --> 01:53.916
Even now you hide your true face
behind illusions.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.833
[in layered voice] Truth is
the greatest illusion of them all.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.207
I think beneath that mask you're scared.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.082
I can see through your tricks.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.708
That makes me a threat.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.416
[sorceress] For the gifted,
arrogance is the ultimate threat.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.208
Your power has merit.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.125
But should one want you dead,

02:15.666 --> 02:17.833
a simple blade would do nicely.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.625
Where is my brother?

02:21.166 --> 02:25.208
Regrettably, his fate wasn't
among your mother's lies.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.000
You killed him.

02:27.583 --> 02:31.665
I gave Ambessa every opportunity
to atone for her transgressions.

02:31.666 --> 02:33.833
She chose pride over progeny.

02:34.416 --> 02:37.000
But you need not bear her crimes.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.790
The test.

02:38.791 --> 02:40.624

Your talents developed quickly.

02:44.958 --> 02:47.082
It's no coincidence.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.083
The Arcane is waking up.

02:49.666 --> 02:51.083
What has my mother done?

02:53.083 --> 02:54.750
[sorceress] A calamity is approaching,

02:55.291 --> 02:57.500
rivaling even the ancient Rune Wars.

02:58.625 --> 03:00.457
Ambessa sits at the helm,

03:00.458 --> 03:02.958
blinded by her thirst for legacy.

03:03.541 --> 03:06.250
Our efforts to divert her course
have foundered.

We can't afford another failure.

This is what you see in me?

03:13.416 --> 03:16.499
I see salvation of your city,

03:16.500 --> 03:18.416

03:19.250 --> 03:20.540
She's my mother.

03:20.541 --> 03:22.207
For all her faults,

03:22.208 --> 03:25.875
she has always done
what she thought was best for the family.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.832
Your brother thought so too,

03:28.833 --> 03:31.083
until he uncovered her secret.

03:31.666 --> 03:32.500
Your birth,

03:33.041 --> 03:35.040
the entire course of your life,

03:35.041 --> 03:36.582
was no accident.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.875
She hid you because you are that
which she covets most:

03:41.041 --> 03:41.958
a weapon.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.833
Today you've been born into a new family,

03:49.416 --> 03:52.333
from which you'll find
there is sadly no return.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.791
Those untouched by the Arcane fear us.

This chain of events started with you.

In my confusion,
I was unable to reconcile this.

But I now understand.

18:05.875 --> 18:11.291
Let us instead do this once again
as partners.

18:13.083 --> 18:16.541
My partner died in this room.

It says something about the late Marcus

20:34.833 --> 20:39.750
that he found imprisoning your sister
to be a greater mercy than killing her.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.958
[Jinx] Killing isn't mercy.

20:42.541 --> 20:46.875
[Silco chuckles] A spark of rebellion
still burns inside that husk, I see.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.291
No.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.665
Killing is a cycle.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.540

long before Vander and me.

Walls of self-doubt
and accepted limitation.

21:14.375 --> 21:17.500

21:18.291 --> 21:19.916

I have chased the archetype of a Medarda.

to merit the blood in my veins.

It was all a lie.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.624
This blood is alien to me.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.375

23:56.416 --> 23:58.375
There is no force in this world

23:59.208 --> 24:00.458

You will never be a passenger.

Topside and bottom,

25:26.958 --> 25:29.000
to aid us in this coming war.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.458
And it will be a war.
