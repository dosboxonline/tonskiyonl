00:03.879 --> 00:07.257
Mr. Gordon, what's the difference
between "assets" and "equity?"

00:07.341 --> 00:09.551
I have a question for you, Steve.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.803
Do you know summer break starts tomorrow?

00:13.096 --> 00:16.391
Check out what I got in my textbook.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.977
Babes.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.481
Pretty hot for a dead lady...

00:22.564 --> 00:24.483
or monster?

00:24.566 --> 00:27.569
Where does one get that?

00:27.653 --> 00:30.197
From my big brother, Big Billy.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.282
Dr. Kalgary made you a brother?

00:35.827 --> 00:39.373
Check out this R-rated movie, little bro!

00:40.457 --> 00:42.000
Oh, yeah.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.545
Pope on Pope action!

00:44.628 --> 00:48.882
Well, my big brother took me to Chimdale
to buy throwing stars.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.468
No fair!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.929
All these big brothers
are introducing people to cool,

00:54.012 --> 00:55.931
new stuff, but I don't have one.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.975
Sucks to be you, kid.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.018
My big brother's so rad.

01:00.102 --> 01:04.857
He's 68, and all his prostate exams
have totally come back negative.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.151
Congratulations!

01:11.572 --> 01:14.366
Good morning, USA

01:14.449 --> 01:17.911
I got a feeling
That it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:17.995 --> 01:20.914
The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face

01:20.998 --> 01:24.626
And he's shining a salute
To the American race

01:27.421 --> 01:30.591
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

01:30.674 --> 01:33.051
Good morning, USA

01:33.135 --> 01:34.136
Ah!

01:35.804 --> 01:38.098
Good morning, USA

01:43.604 --> 01:45.981
Uh-oh, you got bummer face.
What's the crisis?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.900
My life is lame and boring
'cause I don't have

01:47.983 --> 01:50.027
a big brother
to introduce me to cool stuff.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.613
Well, you already have a brother, Jeff.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.573
Jeff's just my brother-in-law.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.034
Exactly. You love the law.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.369
You're always calling the cops
to snitch on our neighbors.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.913
They're running a meth lab!

02:00.996 --> 02:02.915
Spend some time with Jeff.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.541
Trust me, he can show you some stuff.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.502
If you're talking about
that acorn he thinks

02:06.585 --> 02:08.170
is a buffalo's toenail,

02:08.253 --> 02:09.671
he's shown me.

02:09.796 --> 02:13.759
Emergency family meeting
in three, two, one.

02:14.510 --> 02:19.139
I just got the mail,
and I've won a coupon!

02:19.223 --> 02:21.725
30% off for an escape room!

02:21.808 --> 02:24.186
It's such an insane deal
my hands are shaking!

02:24.269 --> 02:26.897
Nope. Jeff beats escape room.

02:27.606 --> 02:31.401
Aww, man. I'm gonna get so many
chicks at this escape room.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.071
Klaus, do you have any idea
what an escape room is?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.032
No way, man. No clue.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.453
This is so cool.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.664
Nobody's ever asked me
to be their brother.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.917
It's not really a thing
that happens all that often.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.003
Hayley's not my sister now, though, right?

02:50.087 --> 02:51.338
Jeff, focus.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.883
I need you to show me the world,
expand my horizons.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.636
Okay, you know how sometimes
the rest of the family

02:57.719 --> 03:00.055
is doing stuff and I'm not around?

03:00.138 --> 03:03.350
It's because I'm looking at this wall.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.272
If you look close enough,
you can see a little face.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.650
I call him Colonel Forbin.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.822
Big brother advice.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.075
These guys are legally required
to give you

03:20.158 --> 03:21.869
as many free samples as you want.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.579
That is not at all true.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.331
Whoops. Darn it all!

03:26.415 --> 03:29.418
I'll help you out by throwing
these away at my house.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.428
-Look, I found another one!
-Wow.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.263
And yet your clothes are always rumpled.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.640
You can use these things on clothes?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.230
Slack slack, slack slack.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.441
Ducks say "slack" now?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.744
What are we doing? This is madness!

04:03.827 --> 04:07.247
Ducks say "what are we doing,
this is madness" now?

04:12.753 --> 04:17.966
Welcome to The Terrifying
Asylum of Dr. Insane-o.

04:18.133 --> 04:23.388
Unlike other escape rooms,
you can take all the time you need.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.682
We'll do it in half that time.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.685
Psst.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.230
Now I am a guard at this asylum,

04:31.313 --> 04:35.108
where Dr. Insane-o,
the demented scientist,

04:35.192 --> 04:39.530
performs unspeakable experiments
on the inmates,

04:39.613 --> 04:40.739
you.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.868
I am so embarrassed for you right now
that you have to do this.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.331
The Doctor is out shopping
for new torture devices to use on you,

04:49.414 --> 04:54.002
unless you figure out
how to escape before he returns.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.172
So you're, like, an asylum guard
with a conscience or something?

04:57.256 --> 04:59.341
You're helping us out? I don't get it.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.761
I know how to escape!

05:02.845 --> 05:04.012
Follow her!

05:05.556 --> 05:07.349
It's locked!

05:07.432 --> 05:09.226
Oh, God, they've thought of everything!

05:12.896 --> 05:14.565
This isn't working out.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.900
I don't think
we're compatible as brothers.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.112
Oh. I'll take you home
as soon as we hang out

05:20.195 --> 05:22.322
in this parking lot for a few hours.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.534
A few hours? In a parking lot?

05:32.875 --> 05:35.043
Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street

05:37.129 --> 05:38.130
Used to be the heart of town

05:38.213 --> 05:40.507
What is this?

05:40.591 --> 05:43.886
The parking lot scene
before a Phish concert!

05:45.846 --> 05:47.514
You just gotta poke around...

05:47.598 --> 05:49.474
It's like I'm on another planet!

05:49.558 --> 05:51.518
This area is Shakedown Street.

05:51.602 --> 05:55.105
It's like a Moroccan bazaar,
except none of this stuff's cursed.

05:55.522 --> 05:59.943
I sell 10 grilled cheeses,
I can afford a ticket to the show.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.864
Cheese cubes, duck bread...

06:04.198 --> 06:05.991
We were getting ingredients!

06:06.074 --> 06:07.659
That's actually pretty smart.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.038
I used my brain to make the idea.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.539
You did it.

06:12.706 --> 06:17.461
You've introduced me to a whole new world,
big brother.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.714
Thanks...

06:20.797 --> 06:22.299
little brother.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.470
Now that we're brothers,
I feel like I can tell you anything.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.390
When I was little,
I saw a man stabbing his family

06:30.474 --> 06:33.185
at a rest stop,
and I pretended not to notice.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.771
Let's just savor this moment.

06:42.986 --> 06:48.242
All right, here's my super-secret tip
to grilled cheese perfection,

06:48.325 --> 06:52.120
totally melted cheese.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.705
Whoa!

06:56.208 --> 06:58.585
Hey, Cheese, who's your bud?

06:58.669 --> 07:01.338
Mars, meet my little brother, Steve.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.342
Your brother makes the best
grilled cheese on Shakedown!

07:05.425 --> 07:10.097
Like a cheddar Michelangelo
sculpting ooey-gooey Davids.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.350
-Did I miss Cheese's cheeses?
-Are you...

07:13.433 --> 07:16.687
NBA Hall of Famer and deeply-hooked
Phish-head, Bill Walton?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.522
Yes, I am.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.440
I was gonna say "in constant back pain

07:20.524 --> 07:22.526
"from your height and posture,"
but that's cool.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.195
I love these things,
even though my heart doctor tells me

07:25.279 --> 07:28.282
that eating even one of them
will take years off my life.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.201
Who's the new kid?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.662
It's Cheese's little brother, dude.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.205
A little Cheese?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.875
"Little Cheese." I like it.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.376
Jim!

07:39.459 --> 07:41.086
Good to see you, too, boy!

07:41.170 --> 07:45.632
That's Runaway Jim, a stray dog
who follows Phish on tour.

07:45.716 --> 07:48.177
Jim doesn't like anyone but Cheese.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.014
He's actually kind of a dick.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.974
Uh-oh, we got another stray dog.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.392
Oh, my God!

07:55.475 --> 07:57.060
Bad Wook! Git!

07:57.144 --> 07:58.520
What the hell was that?

07:58.604 --> 08:00.814
That's a "Wookie" or "Wook,"

08:00.898 --> 08:03.400
a feral hippie always trying to mooch.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.485
Don't confuse them with "woks."

08:05.569 --> 08:09.781
Those are non-feral non-hippies
used to cook stir-fry.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.742
What's she doing?

08:12.451 --> 08:16.121
The finger means she's looking
for a "miracle," a free ticket.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.874
I'd give her mine,
but then I'd need a miracle,

08:18.957 --> 08:23.670
and I don't know if there's another me
out there to give me one.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.590
In the middle of the night...

08:26.673 --> 08:28.926
Whoa, that guy's awesome!

08:29.009 --> 08:31.720
No. That man is a "custie."

08:31.803 --> 08:33.388
Short for "customer."

08:33.472 --> 08:36.725
A rich dude who tries
to buy his way into the scene.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.186
He's human garbage.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.687
Hello there, Mr. Cheese.

08:40.771 --> 08:44.274
Might I still be able to purchase
one of your famous parking lot sandwiches?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.567
Beat it, custie!

08:45.651 --> 08:50.280
We don't need your one-percent,
Wall Street, Scrooge McDuck money!

08:51.615 --> 08:53.075
Nice, Cheese!

08:53.158 --> 08:56.662
I run a charity that gives
puppies to disabled kids.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.622
Screw off, money slave!

08:59.456 --> 09:01.041
Ooh!

09:01.124 --> 09:03.544
Little Cheese burned that custie so hard!

09:03.627 --> 09:05.420
He's totally one of us!

09:10.342 --> 09:13.554
Not the blue elixir on the red brain.
We tried that combo!

09:14.304 --> 09:17.558
Six hours, and we haven't solved
a single damn puzzle!

09:20.143 --> 09:23.105
Huh, this restraint chair
is actually pretty comfy.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.732
Ooh, so is this bloody table.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.359
Maybe we should relax a bit.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.529
Ever since I won that coupon,
it's been go, go, go.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.824
Why are we in such a rush?
Let's enjoy where we are.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.619
Stuck on the beaker puzzle?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.329
How about a hint?

09:39.413 --> 09:42.666
We paid to get in here.
Why are you so focused on getting us out?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.002
Because it's an escape room.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.338
We are escaping.
From our humdrum furniture at home.

09:53.677 --> 09:57.222
So, what'd you think of your
first Phish show, Little Cheese?

09:57.306 --> 10:00.309
Well, I didn't enjoy it
as much as that girl on molly

10:00.392 --> 10:02.144
who kept trying to kiss the music.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.813
But I'm in love with Shakedown Street.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.107
Oh! What's that?

10:07.191 --> 10:09.693
That's the hiss of the Nitrous Mafia,

10:09.776 --> 10:14.031
a violent drug gang that controls
the sale of nitrous oxide balloons.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.871
Even rainbows have shadows.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.664
I don't know if that's true.

10:22.748 --> 10:26.126
The Nitrous Mafia is here
for money, not music.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.755
And they force small mom-and-pop
nitrous dealers out of business.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.636
Promise me you'll stay away from them.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.179
Fine. I promise.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.223
Well, it's time to go anyway.

10:45.646 --> 10:50.025
What if we don't go home?
What if we follow the band on tour?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.194
I don't know
if I could pretend to be a duck

10:52.277 --> 10:53.987
in every city in America.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.197
You wouldn't have to.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.825
In my business class,
I learned how to invest "capital"

10:58.909 --> 11:00.494
in an "industry."

11:00.577 --> 11:02.371
You talkin' like a custie right now!

11:02.454 --> 11:05.082
No, no, no, no, no!
I just mean if we get enough ingredients

11:05.165 --> 11:06.875
to make twice as many grilled cheeses,

11:06.959 --> 11:09.545
we could use the profits
to go to every show.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.880
I'm in!

11:11.964 --> 11:15.425
I should probably tell Hayley
I won't be back for three months.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.844
But I can do that after.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.894
It's working, Steve.

11:25.978 --> 11:29.898
I've never seen this many rumpled-up
dollar bills in my life!

11:29.982 --> 11:32.818
Hooray for the Grilled Cheese Brothers!

11:44.413 --> 11:46.623
I got a hot cheese for Moonbeam!

11:48.417 --> 11:50.419
We should start taking last names.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.807
So, you goin' to Red Rocks?

12:03.891 --> 12:06.643
We're thinking about introducing
a four-cheese blend there,

12:06.727 --> 12:08.395
if that moves the needle for you.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.241
Well, going on tour was a dream come true.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.453
But now that it's over,
I'll need to think of new dreams.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.205
And new come trues.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.998
Grilled Cheese Bros!

12:28.081 --> 12:29.499
See you at the Phish festival?

12:29.583 --> 12:30.626
What festival?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.294
You gotta go, LC!

12:32.377 --> 12:33.921
Camping, artwork,

12:34.004 --> 12:37.174
80,000 people sharing
like 10 porta potties.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.885
Well, then, of course I'm going!

12:39.968 --> 12:42.012
Little Cheese, I love you, man!

12:42.095 --> 12:44.097
I'm starting to come down.

12:44.389 --> 12:48.727
Sorry, Little Cheese, but festivals
are way out of our price range.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.063
But Mars is going! And Tela!

12:51.146 --> 12:52.356
And Bill Walton!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.900
Let's just go home
and do brother stuff there.

12:54.983 --> 12:58.278
Like wait for our parents to die
then fight over their money.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.989
Yeah, I guess we can't
afford the festival.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.407
That's the spirit!

13:14.545 --> 13:16.839
You suck at teeny tiny tennis.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.174
Big Daddy is the teeny tiny man.

13:19.258 --> 13:22.469
You have to try
to escape the room.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.846
It's been weeks.

13:24.179 --> 13:28.058
You said take as much time as we need,
and time we are taking.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.018
I know
you're running out of food.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.770
Fine. Let's negotiate.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.566
Okay. What will it take for you to leave?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.776
-Tom, now!
-Delivery!

13:37.860 --> 13:41.822
I'm more brilliant
than Dr. Insane-o himself.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.825
You'll never get us out.
We're gonna die in here.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.332
I'm not gonna lie,

13:52.416 --> 13:55.460
I'm excited to get home
and start pooping indoors again.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.254
I know how to pay for the festival.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.631
We'll franchise Grilled Cheese Brothers.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.717
I got a loan from the Nitrous Mafia to...

14:01.800 --> 14:03.051
Nitrous Mafia?

14:03.135 --> 14:05.470
You made a brother promise
you'd stay away.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.640
Come on, Jeff. We're not really brothers.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.226
You and me having
the same unshakeable bond

14:11.310 --> 14:13.437
as Luke and Owen Wilson? Please.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.230
-Oh.
-Anyway,

14:15.314 --> 14:17.441
here's all the bread and cheese
I bought with the loan.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.489
Oh, crap, Wooks raided the van!

14:25.073 --> 14:27.951
The Nitrous Mafia's gonna kill me
if I don't pay them back!

14:28.035 --> 14:29.912
They were very specific about that!

14:29.995 --> 14:33.081
Seems like you got yourself
into quite the predicament.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.168
How are the Grilled Cheese Brothers
gonna solve this one?

14:36.251 --> 14:38.795
Oh, so now we're brothers again?

14:38.879 --> 14:41.465
You mean that thing I said
about not being brothers?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.176
Brothers say mean stuff to each other.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.469
Dick?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.138
You're right. I'll go talk to them.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.391
Phew.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.476
Jeff's got it covered.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.311
Aah!

14:59.316 --> 15:02.486
"We're keeping your brother
until he works off your debt."

15:02.569 --> 15:04.363
What have I done?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.418
In the middle of the night

15:18.502 --> 15:20.629
Hello, fellow fan. Why so blue?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.798
The Nitrous Mafia is forcing Jeff

15:22.881 --> 15:26.593
to sell nitrous at the festival
until he pays off my debt.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.178
Harsh toke.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.180
-Am I using that right?
-Kind of.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.683
Well, I'm goin' if you want a lift.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.311
Not in a million years, custie!

15:37.980 --> 15:39.481
Yes, thank you so much.

15:39.565 --> 15:43.068
You think you're better than everyone else
with your fancy RV?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.778
You are. This is exquisite.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.624
Usually the Nitrous Mafia
sells gas in the parking lot.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.920
But today we're all selling gas...

16:03.630 --> 16:06.383
...inside the concert venue.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.970
How about I hang back
and tie-dye the gang's sweatpants?

16:10.053 --> 16:11.597
How about you...

16:12.890 --> 16:14.558
...get me my money?

16:14.641 --> 16:18.562
So how are we getting
the nitrous tanks past security, boss?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.939
Who said anything about...

16:22.316 --> 16:23.317
...tanks?

16:28.864 --> 16:31.366
Now I get
what the mean nitrous man meant

16:31.450 --> 16:34.036
when he said, "Who said
anything about tanks?"

16:34.119 --> 16:36.038
It was actually pretty clever.

16:38.624 --> 16:42.044
I just want to check in, Stan.
You're really sticking on 11?

16:42.127 --> 16:44.171
-Like glue, my man.
-Hello.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.715
Thanks, I'll take an 18-year Macallan
on the rocks.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.425
We haven't been able

16:48.509 --> 16:51.595
to book this room for a month.
We're closing.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.889
A server farm is taking over our lease.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.853
Don't bite on this, gang.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.897
It's classic Insane-o trickery.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.984
You do realize
there is no Dr. Insane-o, right?

17:06.068 --> 17:08.820
But there is an Ernie. He's VP of tech.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.031
You'll liaise with him from now on.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.248
So, Ernie's bringing my Macallan, then?

17:19.331 --> 17:21.333
Ooh, it's getting kinda hot in here.

17:21.542 --> 17:24.419
I'll tell you who's sweatin'.
Dr. Insane-o.

17:24.503 --> 17:25.879
This is so desperate.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.720
We'll take that hint now!
Come on, we're gonna die in here!

17:33.804 --> 17:36.807
Isn't that
what you said you wanted?

17:39.601 --> 17:41.353
Don't you see, Stan?

17:41.436 --> 17:46.191
The Escape Room Lady, she's Dr. Insane-o.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.194
Twilight Zone moment!

17:53.949 --> 17:55.367
Festivals are so neat.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.577
Shut up, Custie!

17:56.660 --> 17:59.580
I gotta find Jeff
before he's arrested for selling balloons!

18:02.165 --> 18:05.002
Oh, man, if I get caught
with all this nitrous,

18:05.085 --> 18:06.336
I'm so screwed!

18:09.298 --> 18:10.299
Hold up!

18:12.509 --> 18:15.053
You lost a little air. Let me top you off.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.139
I'm a cool security guard.

18:24.855 --> 18:28.400
Weird, no one down there's
selling nitrous balloons.

18:28.483 --> 18:32.070
Weirder, buncha people
wearing Plokémon suits.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.327
The Nitrous Mafia aren't selling balloons.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.953
They are the balloons.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.874
But which one's Jeff?

18:45.626 --> 18:47.169
Runaway Jim!

18:47.252 --> 18:49.338
He's only horny for Jeff's leg.

18:49.463 --> 18:50.547
So that must be Jeff.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.840
Shut up, Custie!

18:51.924 --> 18:53.217
Not now, Jim!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.010
I don't want you mixed up in all this.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.563
Jeff! We gotta get you out of here
before you get arrested.

19:06.647 --> 19:09.066
Not until I pay back
the Nitrous Mafia

19:09.149 --> 19:12.027
or we'll be looking over our shoulder
for the rest of our lives!

19:12.986 --> 19:15.280
Then let's bust 'em right now.

19:17.241 --> 19:21.370
Officers! Everyone wearing
a Plokémon suit is a nitrous dealer.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.871
You gotta catch 'em all!

19:26.124 --> 19:28.585
Oh, yeah. That's the real deal.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.214
Freeze, Plokémen!

19:32.297 --> 19:34.049
We know you're all made of drugs!

19:36.301 --> 19:37.636
Nitrous Mafia!

19:37.719 --> 19:40.389
Initiate helium escape protocol!

19:45.769 --> 19:48.397
The Nitrous Mafia's getting away!

19:48.522 --> 19:50.524
Phish fans unite!

19:53.819 --> 19:57.739
Right. Phish fans don't own
any sharp stuff.

19:59.825 --> 20:03.287
Ah. The only thing
that can stop the Mafia now

20:03.370 --> 20:04.913
is a miracle.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.373
A miracle!

20:07.833 --> 20:08.959
A miracle!

20:09.042 --> 20:10.794
A miracle!

20:21.722 --> 20:23.098
-Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

20:23.182 --> 20:25.100
Yeah!

20:25.350 --> 20:27.561
I was wrong about you, Big Cheese.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.897
Only a real big brother would risk himself

20:29.980 --> 20:32.191
to help his dumb little brother
out of trouble.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.650
Thanks, Little Cheese.

20:33.734 --> 20:36.445
-Let's go home.
-Or...

20:36.528 --> 20:41.491
should us brothers split the acid
I've been saving in my pocket all tour?

20:41.575 --> 20:43.493
That's all you, big bro.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.997
Good, 'cause I already took both doses

20:47.080 --> 20:50.459
and I'm banana monkey bingo foot.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.837
May I have this darnce, Madam Eucalyptus?

21:02.262 --> 21:03.931
Bye-bye! See you soon!
